            SIR IOHN SMYTHE his Proëme Dedicatorie, to the Nobilitie of the Realme of England.
            
               
                  RIght Honorable and most noble Lordes:
            
            Euen as the wisedome and humilitie of the notable men of later ages, haue giuen greater honor to the excellencie of men in all Artes and Sciences of former ages and greater antiquitie, than to themselues; not onlie acknowledging themselues to be inferiours vnto them, but also, that the greatest skil and knowledge which they haue attained vnto, hath (in the greatest part) proceeded from such notable men, either by hearing and obseruing their opinions, or by reading of their works, or els by reading of others that haue written of the iudgements and actions of such excellent men: Euen so, the vanitie and ouerweening of yong men, and chieflie of our Nation in this our time (I meane within these twentie yeares) haue so exceeded and superabounded, that they haue not been ashamed, not onlie to attribute vnto themselues greater wisedome and sufficiencie in all Arts and Sciences, and speciallie in the Arte Militarie, than to the notable men and great Captaines of former ages and greater antiquitie, but also to dishable them in respect of themselues and their sufficiencie, and all others also yet liuing, that are men of greater yeares and antiquitie, than they are, both of our owne Nation, as also forraine, that haue

seene and serued in the well ordered warres of Emperours or Kings, in times past; saying, (to make the same more probable) that their warres are now growne to greater perfection, and greatlie altered from the warres of times past; vnder pretence whereof, they haue of late sought both by publique and priuate perswasions and inducements, to reduce all our auncient proceedings in matters Militarie, which they are vtterlie ignorant of, to their owne errors and disorders, procuring also (as much as they can) by their vaine and friuolous obiections against our Archerie, to suppresse and extinguish the exercise and seruiceable vse of Long-bowes. But now, let vs come to consider, who are these of our Nation that doo attribute vnto themselues greater wisedome and sufficiencie in all Arts and Sciences, and especiallie, in the Art Militarie, than to the excellent men of former times and ages, and to the auncient experienced men yet liuing. Are they newlie fallen from heauen with some diuine instinct and gift, to renewe, reforme, and teach vs the Arte Militarie? No, no such matter, but euen such as we knew children, or very yong men within these twentie yeares. What then? are they Noblemen themselues by title, or descended of noble and excellent fathers, or themselues of great sobrietie, continencie and worthines of mind? No truelie, for such as are Noblemen by birth, or descended of noble fathers, or themselues worthie, doo knowe by good education and instruction, that experience is the mother of Science, and therefore, will not neglect nor contemne the wisedome and sufficiencie of former ages, nor the opinions and iudgements of the auncient and experienced men of this time; but will (with humility) yeeld themselues to heare and learne by their experiences. What then? are they endued with anie such rare gifts, or corporall presences, wisedomes and vertues, as I haue in my time knowne diuers, and doo yet knowe some verie fewe yong Gentlemen endued withall, that therefore we may admire, and thinke them to bee extraordinarie and notable men? No in troth, but some yong, and some now growne to be of the middle age, all which, are but after the common sort, both in their corporall presences, and in their wisedomes and vertues, vnlesse

(peraduenture) somtimes, when they fall into argumēt of some such matters, that they would seeme to haue great skil of, then indeed, they shew themselues to be extraordinarie: for in steade of alleadging reasons and examples, according to the vse of other Nations, with quietnes and courteous phrase of speach, they argue for life and death, with hastie and furious wordes, as though there were no more in the experience of men of greater yeares, but that which they say: which in the opinions of all men of any iudgement, that are of wise and braue Nations, is thought more meete for the cōmon sort of such as are chiding womē, than for men that do professe any knowledge in Arts & Sciences, and chiefly Militarie. What? is the number great of these controllers of Antiquitie in matters Militarie, that are infected with so great an ouerweening? Certainely, no, the number of the chiefe of them is very small and fewe, and therfore, sauing for Arithmetikes sake, not woorthie to be called Number. And those that are possessed with this ouerweening, are such as do presume of their long experience in such warres as they haue serued in, all which are more addicted to selfe-will, newe fashions and fancies, than to any reason and experience Militarie. What, haue they no imitators? Yes, many, that are abused by their perswasions: but yet they are such, as I doo thinke may bee easily perswaded and reduced to better iudgement vpon sound reasons and demonstrations vnto them shewed, or vpon the experience of some newe and well ordered warres. But now, I pray you, in what warres of Emperours, Kings, or formed Common wealthes haue these our such men of war serued, and learned their great pretended skill and sufficiencie? by the which they may with the more reason and experience assume vnto themselues, to condemne the ancient orders and proceedings Military of diuers forren warlike Nations, as also of our most valiant and wise ancestors; or the experience in the Art Military, of many both forren as also of some auncient men, yet liuing of our owne Nation, in respect of the warres that they haue serued in; and therefore, that vpon their greater experience and iudgement, they should seeke to reduce all our auncient proceedings and orders Militarie, to their

owne opinions and fancies, and therewithall, to procure the vtter suppressing and extinguishing of our auncient and peculiar weapon the Long-bowe? Certainelie, all men knowe, that the chiefest warres that they euer serued in, where they haue learned anie experience, hath bene in the disordered and tumultuarie warres of the Lowe Countries vnder the States, or (peraduenture) some litle diuers yeres past, in the intestine & licentious warres of France. Well, if it be so (without any further question) I doo not then meruaile, that they doo alleadge to set foorth and beautifie their owne sufficiencies, and to disable all others both auncient and moderne, that haue serued in the well ordered wars of Emperours or Kings, that their wars are now growen to greater perfection, and greatlie altered from the wars of times past, in the which I do concurre with them, and the rather because they verifie the olde Prouerb, which is, That such as were neuer but in Hell, doo thinke that there is no other Heauen. For true it is, that the ciuile and licentious wars of France, and the tumultuarie and disordered wars of the Lowe Countries, which haue beene their schooles, and the chiefe warres that euer they sawe, haue beene altogether without anie formed Milicia and discipline militarie, & therfore farre different from the well ordered wars that haue bin in former times, betwixt Emperors, Kings, and formed common wealthes.
            And now, because I intend in this Proëme vnto your Lordships, as brieflie as I can, to shewe by what meanes our Nation hath verie much decaied, or rather forgotten all our auncient orders and exercises Militarie, with the wonderfull euills that haue in other ages, and do now (through long peace) threaten vs againe to happen, as also that it hath been impossible for them, or any others, to learne any Art or Science Militarie in the ciuill warres of France, nor in the disordered warres of the Lowe Countries vnder the States, but rather the contrarie, that is, disorder and confusion. I therefore will first make manifest by diuers examples, by what meanes and accidents, the Art and Science Militarie hath in many Empires, Kingdomes and Common wealths, as also in this Kingdome, come

sometimes, to be vtterlie forgotten; and at other times, to growe to great disorder and confusion: and so finallie, that it is most euident, that such of our Nation as haue seene and serued in no other wars, but in such confused and disordered wars, as aforesaid, could no wayes attaine to anie such vnderstanding in the Art and discipline militarie, that they may be anie wayes deemed, or thought worthie to controll or finde fault with the orders and proceedings of our wise and worthie auncestours, nor of the olde and auncient Noblemen, Gentlemen and Captains yet liuing, that haue bene trained vp in matters of armes, as it shall euidently appeare by a fewe of their infinite vnsoldiorlike proceedings and disorders, which I will set downe in the end of this Preface. I thinke it is euident to all men of wisedome and discretion, that haue read diuerse notable Histories, with consideration and iudgement, as also that haue well considered of this our age, that there are two thinges of all others that are the greatest enemies to the Arte and science Militarie, and haue been the occasion of the great decay, and oftentimes, the vtter ruine of many great Empires, Kingdoms & Common wealths: of the which, the first is long peace, which ensuing after great warres to diuers Nations that haue had notable Milicias and exercises Militarie in great perfection, they by enioying long peace, haue so much giuen themselues to couetousnes, effeminacies and superfluities, that they haue either in a great part, or els vtterlie forgotten all orders and exercises Militarie, in such sort, that when they haue been forced to enter into a warre defensiue for the defence of their Dominions against any forraine Nation or Nations, that haue had a puissant and formed Milicia, they haue been so voide of the orders & exercises of war of their forefathers, that either they haue bin cōquered by their enemies inuading, or at least, haue been put in hazard of the losse of their estates and dominions, as it may verie well appeare by the Egyptians, who being one of the first Nations of the world, that had the Art and science Militarie in great perfection, by the which they 
                  ••
               tained many victories and conquests. And thereby finding no Nation that durst assaile them, they did after by enioying long

peace and prosperitie, so giue themselues to their delights, couetousnesse and effeminacies, neglecting all orders and exercises Militarie, that being in processe of time, and in diuerse ages assailed and inuaded by diuers other warlike Nations, that had the Arte and Science Militarie, in great perfection, and were allured thereunto, partly by the wonderful fertilitie of Aegypt, but chiefly, because the Aegyptians were growen effeminate without anie orders and exercises Militarie, they came to be by them subdued and conquered, and euer since haue liued in subiection, and seruitude to diuers other Nations. The Macedonians and Grecians also, that had vnder that notable conquerour, Alexander the great, and other notable Princes and Captains of those Nations, the Arte Militarie in great perfection, whereby they atchieued many notable victories and conquests, did after, by liuing in long peace, accompanied with great dissention, couetousnes and superfluities, so forget al their orders and exercises Militarie, that they came to be conquered by the Romanes: and of late yeares by their like negligence in matters of warre, were vtterly subdued and brought into seruitude by the Turkes. The Romanes also themselues, after that they had by their notable milicia, atchieued wonderfull victories and conquests, through the peace but of a few yeares, did growe so to decay in their discipline Militarie, that Hanniball that notable Captaine of Carthage, atchieuing diuerse victories in Spaine against the Romanes, and marching with his army through France, and passing the mountaines of the Alpes, did (before that the Romanes could renue and reduce themselues to their auncient Milicia) inuade Italie, and woon diuers notable battailes, and killed diuers of their Consuls and their whole Armies, and put Rome it selfe in great feare to be sacked and conquered. And if we list to consider of our owne Countrie and Nation in diuers ages, omitting infinite numbers of other examples of greater antiquitie, as also of later ages; we may see, that our auncestours the Saxons, that conquered and expulsed the Britans (the auncientest inhabitants of this Realme) by reason that they found them altogether without any orders and exercises Militarie, wholie giuen

to idlenes, vitiousnes & delights, the same Saxons after, by lōg peace with forren Nations, being giuen to couetousnes, vice, and superfluities, as also to ciuile dissention amongst themselues at home, did so confound and forget their Arte and Science Militarie, by the which they in former times had bene conquerours, that they themselues came after to be conquered by the Danes, and shortly after by the Normans. All which examples of conquests, and daungers of conquering, with infinit others of great Empires, Kingdoms and Common wealths haue proceeded chiefly through the negligence of their Princes, Rulers and Magistrates, who through long peace, and ouermuch securitie, did gouerne their subiectes onely by lawes politike, neglecting and contemning all orders and exercises Militarie. And this dooth most manifestly appeare by many notable Histories that doo containe great actions.
            The second cause which doth confound and disorder all discipline and orders Militarie, is, intestine and ciuile warres, as we may see by many examples, of the which for breuities sake, I will only alleage two; the one ancient, & the other of this time. The first is of the Arabians, which nation, vnder Mahomet that false prophet, & his successors, Halifas, conquered a great part of Europe, Affrike and Asia, & were (so long as they had but one supreme Halifa or Prince, to gouerne the Arabians and al their dominions by them conquered) so mighty through their excellent Milicia, that no forren Nation durst assaile them. But after, by their long liuing in peace and great prosperitie; in the end, through the viciousnes and insufficiencie of one of their supreme Halifas, that at that time raigned ouer them, fell into reuolt and intestine wars amongst themselues, striuing for the supreme throne and gouernement; in such sort, that in few yeres, they did so corrupt and confound their ancient discipline Militarie, & so weaken themselues by many cō
               fused battels, sackings and spoiles; and by diuiding their great Empire into diuers partes, vnder diuers Halifas, that the Turkes (a new Nation, who had an excellent Milicia) did inuade their dominions, and within few yeares brought them into subiection to the Turkie Empire.
            
               Now the other example, which is of our time, is Fraunce, which kingdome (vntill Lewes the eleuenth did serue himselfe with mercinaries) had a well ordered Milicia, offensiue and defensiue, and that chiefly on horsebacke, and yet diuers yeares had some reliques and remnants of the same; but nowe in this later time, the French Nation, hauing continued seauen or eight and twenty yeares in ciuile warres amongest themselues, they haue so corrupted and confounded all their ancient orders and proceedings in matters Militarie, that they haue at this present, no shew, token, nor mention of the same, but disorder, disobedience and confusion; which hath proceeded of the like causes that brought the Arabians and many other Nations (through intestine warres) to corrupt and confound their Arte and Science Militarie, as it shall more particularly appeare by that which followeth. I think all men of experience & iudgement in matters of warre, do know, that the first & principall thing that is requisite to assemble and forme an armie, or armies, and to keepe the same in obedience with good effect, is treasure, to maintaine pay and reward, with seuere execution of excellent Lawes Militarie. Which, what Prince soeuer he be that hath, with sufficient Generals, & other Officers, to commaund and gouerne, may very well haue a well ordered Milicia; by reason that no souldiours well payd, and chiefly being subiects to the Prince that they serue, can vse any excuses not to obserue all lawes and orders Militarie, of Sea or Land, Towne, Campe or Field. Besides that, vpon any transgression of orders, it is lawfull for the Captains and higher Officers, to correct, reforme and punish, according to the lawes and ordinances Militarie: from whence it commeth to passe, that euen as the Citizens of a wel ordered Citie, through the execution of good lawes, ciuil and criminall, by excellent gouernors, doo liue in great order, quietnes and prosperitie, without any ciuile dissention: Euen so, an Armie in the field, being well payed, prouided for and gouerned, doo liue as orderly in towne, campe and field, without robbing, spoiling, or otherwise iniuring any other, but the common enemie.
            Now to maintaine, and continue the same, it dooth behoue

a King in his kingdome, and chieflie in the bodie of the same to be well obeyed; that by the quiet obedience of his subiects, he may receiue all his customes, rents and reuenewes, with all other subsidies and aides, that of antiquitie his progenitors haue accustomed to receiue; with newe supplies of men and munitions from time to time to ranforce his Armie or Armies. All which, the French Kings (through their subiects so often taking Armes, and such intestine warres so manie yeares) haue so come to want, that they haue not had anie meanes possible to maintaine any other but a deformed and disordered Milicia; by reason that the Nobilitie and Princes of the bloud, vppon diuers legitimate causes by them pretended, with their friends and followers, taking Armes against them, a great part of the reuenewe of the Crowne, with all other customes, subsidies and aides, haue in diuers Cities, Townes and Prouinces, come to cease, and the same to be enioyed by the Kings enemies armed: by meanes whereof the French Kings, that haue liued in the times of these intestine warres, haue not had treasure to pay their Armies, whereby to keepe their men of warre in any discipline; Besides that, by those continuall dissentions, they haue lackt a great part of their Nobilitie and subiects, to ranforce their Armies. The Nobilitie also, and Princes of the bloud, that haue continued in Armes against their Kings (notwithstanding their vsurped reuenewe and treasure of the Crowne) haue beene as little, or lesse able to pay their men of warre; so that, all the intestine and ciuill warres, that haue continued so manie yeares in France, with the slaughter and destruction of such infinite numbers of all sorts of people, haue beene maintained and continued tumultuaritie, more by spoyle, sedition, passion and faction; than by any pay, order, and discipline Militarie.
            Whereof it hath come to passe, that such Armies as haue serued vnder the French Kings, or vnder the Nobilitie, that haue continued in armes against them, (how good Officers & gouernors soeuer they had) could not haue any certen nor ordered

               Milicia; by reason, that through the lacke of certaine pay, and no hope of reward for extraordinary deserts, it hath come to passe, that the souldiors thereby being made voluntary, haue obeyed their Captaines no otherwise than hath pleased themselues, altering and changing their weapons, as also themselues out of one band into an other, and sometimes horsemen to become footemen, and footemen to become horsemen; besides their forraging and stragling from their Ensignes without order; as also their negligence and lacke of vigilancie in their watches, bodies of watches and centinels, and by disordering themselues vpon euery light occasion both in battallion, squadron and troupe. Captaines also, haue oftetimes formed, or rather deformed their bands, both on horsebacke and on foote, with armors and weapons, new inuented by themselues, without controlment, different from all orders Militarie. The Generals, and whole armies also, both of the one side and of the other haue very seldome, or neuer, according to the Arte Militarie, lodged themselues in any campe formed, but dispersed and scattered by bands in many Townes and Villages with great disorder. Besides that, both Captaines, Souldiors and all other men of warre, for lacke of ordinary pay, haue liued a great deale more vpon the spoile, and misusing of the common people, their fellow-subiects and friends, than vpon any spoile, or annoying of the enemy armed: through which great disorders and lack of pietie, contrary to all diuine & humane lawes, it hath come to passe, that such Officers, Captains and Souldiours that haue serued any long time in such licentious and tumultuarie wars (be they subiects or mercenaries) can very hardly after be reformed and reduced to containe themselues, and liue vnder any discipline Military, where Iustice without fauour is executed, because they neuer before liued vnder any seuerity of lawes Martiall; but haue spent their times, & learned their chiefe soldiorie, in such disordered & licentious wars, where in respect of spoile and gaine, they haue accounted and holden both friends & enemies al in one reckoning and degree. Now the ciuil wars of France hauing growen to be so disordered, & without any discipline through their intestine dissentions

(as I haue before mentioned) with many other disorders, a great deale more orderlie, and particularlie set downe by that braue soldier, Monsieur de la Noüe in his discourses: how farre of further, then is it euidēt, that the tumultuarie, & confused warres of the Lowe Countries haue been from all order & discipline Militarie, where both mercenaries and subiects, haue serued vnder subiects, called by the title of States? which gouernment hath been popular, and consisted of sundrie heads, and of those verie fewe Noble; but Merchants, Citizens and Burghers; whose pay as it was manie yeares to the English, French and other mercenaries more by words and promises, than by any good performance: so the seruices of such hirelings, were as disordred, and voide of all discipline Militarie; as it hath most manifestlie appeared by their proceedings and actions; some part of the which, (by the helpe of almightie God) I will set downe, that thereby it may be apparantlie discouered, what kind of men of warre those disordred warres of the Lowe Countries haue bred and brought forth, and of what experience and sufficiencie, they may bee esteemed to be, that doo with such an ouerweening disesteeme, and condemne the great Captaines of times past, as also the old men of warre of diuers Nations yet liuing, in respect of themselues; saying further, that their warres of the Low Countries doo farre exceed and excell the warres of times past in all perfection. And therefore, I will set downe and compare part of the opinions, proceedings and orders Militarie, of the great Captaines and men of warre, both auncient and moderne; with the straunge opinions, newe kinds of Milicias (or rather Malicias, and disorderlie proceedings of our such men of warre. And in al those things which I in this Proëme will mention concerning them and their wonderfull errors and disorders Militarie, I will not set downe anie thing of mine owne knowledge, nor inuented, nor deuised by me, but a verie few of the smallest of an infinite number of their disorderlie proceedings, contrarie to all pietie, and discipline Militarie, which I haue heard manie, & manie times publikelie reported by manie valiant Gentlemen of our Nation, that haue detested the same; diuers of the which are

of verie good houses, and not anie one of them but that hath serued in those warres, some of them fifteene or sixteene yeares past, in the time of the Commendator major Requesenes, others of them a dozen yeares past in the time of Don Iuan de Austria, and others at the Earle of Leicesters going ouer, and also before. All which Gentlemen hauing been eye witnesses of those wonderfull disorders (which haue redownded to the consumption and losse of many thousands of yong Gentlemen, Yeomen, and Yeomen sonnes, and others of the most dispost and lustie sort of people of our Nation) haue mooued me (not vpon any hate, I protest, that I beare vnto any of them in respect of my selfe, but onlie for the great loue that I beare to my Prince, Countrie and Nation) to commit those things with great blame of writing, to the intent that hereafter the same may be some kind of terror to all others to take such barbarous and base proceedings in hand. And therefore will proceed to the matter.
            First, it is very well knowne to all men of experience and iudgement in matters of Armes, that all such great Captaines as haue been Lieutenants generalls to Emperours, Kings, or formed Common wealths, or that with regiments of their owne Nation haue serued forraine Princes, as mercenaries (knowing that Iustice is the Prince of all order and gouernment both in warre and peace, by the which God is honoured and serued, and Magistrates and Officers obeyed) haue at the first forming of their Armies or such Regiments, by great aduise of Counsell established sundrie lawes both Politique and Martiall, with Officers for the superintending and due execution of the same, which haue been notified to all their men of warre, as also at euerie incamping or lodging haue been set, written or printed in certaine tables in conuenient places for all soldiers and men of warre to behold, to the intent that none might transgresse through ignorance: All which by some of the chiefe of our such mercenarie men of warre haue been so vtterly contemned, or by them not vnderstood, that they neuer vsed anie such matter, but in stead of the same, haue onlie set downe a verie few written lawes, altogether cunningly and artificiallie,

tending to terrifie their soldiers from demanding of their paies due; as also from complaining of the misusages of their Captaines and higher Officers: but to terrifie them from spoyling, robbing, and taking by force from the common countrie people their friends, with many other great offences, there was no prohibition, nor penaltie of lawes set downe; they often terming those to be best soldiers that could liue without pay, by stealing and spoyling most; saying further, that to forme and establish many lawes politique and Martiall, it was the manner of old dunsicall Captaines in times past, who did not vnderstand their excellent discipline of this time, and that all lawes of Towne, Campe and Field should bee in the wisedome and discretion of the Generall; which their grosse and ignorant conceites, through their lacke of iustice, cost the liues of a great sort of braue men; for in stead of proceeding orderlie vppon lawes Militarie established (as aforesaid) they proceeded according to such lawes as they conceiued in their owne simple braines. Whereof it hath come to passe, that manie of honest parentage haue been condemned to death vpon diuers offences, that the transgressors themselues haue not knowne to be transgressions of death, and others that haue committed as great, or greater offences, haue escaped with verie little or no punishment at all.
            Also, whereas in all ages and times, all Emperours, Kings, and formed Common wealthes, that haue employed their Generalls with Armies either in warres offensiue or defensiue, haue established a Counsell of men of great sufficiencie both in warre and peace to assist their Generalls; of the which some of the chiefe Officers of the Armie, by the right and due of their Offices, were alwaies of the same counsell, as also some others, according to the choise and liking of such Princes; and this, to the intent that their Generalls in all important matters should consult with them: The conclusion, and resolution of such consultations notwithstanding to remaine in the wisedome, iudgement and valour of the Generalls. And that likewise it hath bin alwaies the vse of all mercenarie Coronels both Almanes and Italians, that haue been hired into the seruices

of forraine Princes vpon all important occasions to consult with their Sergeants Maiors, and certeine other Captaines and Officers for the well ordring and gouerning of their Regiments. Euen so contrariwise, some of our chiefe men of warre that haue had great charges in the Lowe Countrie warres, haue not onelie contemned and disdained to haue anie counsell about them, or to take counsell of some of their Captaines and other Officers, but haue also spoken to the blame and reproach of some notable and very sufficient Generalls of this time, because they haue vsed in all important matters to consult with their Counsellors, saying, that they were therefore verie simple men, and that they were able to doo nothing of themselues, but onlie by the aduise of Counsell. By the which, our such men of warre haue not onelie shewed a wonderfull ouerweening, and lacke of discretion in those their vaine and fond opinions; but also haue in the gouernment of their charges (which was altogether of their owne heads) shewed themselues as fond and voide of all reason and order Militarie. Also, whereas all wise and sufficient Generalls and Coronels haue alwaies had speciall regard, when the Enemie hath not been neere at hand; that their Sergeants Maiors, Captaines, & other Officers, should oftentimes in the field reduce their bands & regiments into diuers formes, and to teach their soldiers all orders Militarie, with the vse of their weapons in euerie degree, time and place, as also how to lodge in their quarters orderlie, and therewithall to vnderstand the orders of watches, bodies of watches, centinells, rounds, and counterrounds, with many other matters Militarie, whereby they might be made prompt and readie to encounter with the Enemie: so contrariwise, our such men of warre in the Lowe Countries did very seldome, or rather neuer instruct nor teach their soldiers any such matter, whereby it hath come to passe, that their old soldiers Piquers with their piques, Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers with their weapons of fire, haue in certaine trainings here in England shewed and vsed such Matiches, as they haue giuen occasion to bee scorned and laughed at, by such old Captaines of experience as haue seene their doings.
            
               And whereas also all men of warre in times past haue had speciall care that all their soldiers should be fitlie apparelled and armed, according to the different weapons that all sorts of their soldiers did vse, and that they should not lacke any of their weapons, nor any part or peece of their armours, but that the same should be by them fitlie and aptlie worne, and from time to time kept cleane and neate: So contrariwise, some of our such men of warre haue holden these matters for such trifles, that they haue had so little care thereof, that they haue been contented to suffer their soldiers to goe euill weaponed, and worse armed, and many of them without any kind of armour at all, and in their apparell all to be totterd and torne, and some of them bare legged, or bare footed like roges: a thing neuer before heard off in any age, that men of warre, and chieflie the English nation, going to the aide of a forraine Nation, and the countrie and people wonderfull rich and plentifull in all abundance, and their Captaines themselues verie gallant in apparell, and their purses full of gold; that their soldiers should be in such poore and miserable estate. Also, whereas it hath been the vse of all great Captaines and Chieftaines, vpon anie long march & enterprise intended, with all foresight & prouidence to prouide plentie of victuall, and all other things necessarie for the sustenance of all their soldiers, euen to the meanest & least of accompt; as also of great store and plentie of powder & shot, with some ouerplus of weapons of diuers sorts for al accidents & employments, with al other things requisite: So some of our such men of warre vpon their occasions of marches and enterprises, haue prouided plentie of victuall onlie for themselues and their followers, suffering their bands & regimēts to straggle, & spoyle the people of the Countrie oftentimes to their owne mischiefe, & in the rest to take their aduentures, and sometimes to starue, or at least to be driuen to great extremitie of hūger. Besides that, for powder, shot, and ouerplus of weapōs, they haue prouided no more than that which their soldiers haue carried about them, which haue been with great scarcitie; which doth argue their small care of the health & safetie of their soldiers, & their little intention to doo any great hurt to the enemie, and therewithall

a great ignorance in the Art and Science Militarie. And whereas also in all well ordered Milicias, the commendation and sufficiencie of all Generalls, Coronells, Captaines and other Officers, hath consisted in knowing how to command, gouerne, and order their Armies, Regiments, bands and companies, and to winne the loue of their soldiers by taking great care of their healths and safeties, as also by all examples of vertue and worthines, not onlie by instruction, but also by action in their owne persons, venturing their liues in all actions against the enemie amongst them, and therewithall accompting of them in sicknes and health, or wounds receiued, as of their owne children; and that all Coronells and Captaines of horsemen, according to all discipline, haue vsed to serue amongst their horsemen on horsebacke, and that all Coronells and Captaines of footmen, yea euen the verie Lieutenants generalls, and Kings themselues (if their Armies and forces of the field haue consisted more of footmen than of horsemen) haue alwaies vsed by all discipline Militarie, vppon the occasion of anie battaile, to put their horses from them, and to serue on foote, and to venter their liues in the former rankes. Euen so contrariwise, the new discipline of some of our chiefe men of warre of the Lowe Countries hath been, neuer to winne nor procure the loue of their soldiers by anie affabilitie or fauour shewed vnto them, nor yet by anie care taking for their healthes and safeties, and vpon anie accidents of sicknes, or wounds receiued, they haue presentlie disesteemed them, as base and vile creatures, neuer comming amongst them neither in sicknes nor health, but onlie vppon occasion of seruice: and for anie instruction or examples of vertue and worthines in the actions of their owne persons to be shewed amongst their soldiers, it hath not been their delight nor profession; and for them to haue imitated the great and famous Captaines of al other times, both ancient and moderne, in venturing their liues amongst their soldiers (as aforesaid) according to their Milicia, that hath consisted more of footmen than of horsemen, it hath been contrarie to their newe discipline, which hath not permitted that they should learne anie thing of anie great Captaines, but onelie of themselues:

whereof it hath come to passe, that some of our such chiefe men of warre in the Low Countries, whose strength in the field hath consisted of farre greater numbers and forces of footmen than horsemen, and that some other ordinarie Captaines also, whose charges haue consisted onlie of footmen, haue (presentlie vpon their squadrons formed, and approach or sight of the Enemie) mounted vppon horses of swift Carrires, and either haue accompanied their footmen vpon the flankes or rereward, being so well mounted, or els haue put themselues into some bands of horsmen; as though it were against their reputation to serue on foote amongst their soldiers; or rather (as it may be thought) that vppon anie hard accident they might be readie (leauing their soldiers to the slaughter) to saue themselues rather with the force of their heeles and spurres, than with any of sword, which amongst manie other, hath been one special cause that there haue been so great numbers of soldiers at diuers times consumed and slaine, and neuer anie Chieftaine, nor any other of our such men of warre. Which their newe discipline is such a mockerie, and so contrarie to all order Militarie, as that such are not to bee accoumpted worthie to take the charge of men, nor yet to bee reckoned amongst the number of soldiers.
            And whereas also all great Captaines, Chieftaines, and men of charge haue holden for a Maxime, to preserue by all meanes possible the liues of their soldiers, and not to employ and hazard them vppon euerie light occasion, and therewithall to esteeme the preseruation of the liues of a verie fewe of their soldiers, before the killing of great numbers of their enemies: Euen so contrariwise, the new discipline of some of our men of warre in the Lowe Countries, hath been, to send, and employe their soldiers into manie daungerous and vaine exploites and seruices, without any reason Militarie, hauing sure regard to their owne safeties; as though they desired and hoped to haue more gaine and profite by the dead paies of their soldiers slaine, than encrease of reputation by the atchieuing and preuailing in anie such enterprises.
            Besides that, it hath been sometimes a practise by some of

our such men of warre, when they haue borne anie hatred or malice to such as haue serued vnder them, to deuise some dangerous enterprise of purpose to employ thē in, from whence they might hardly escape with their liues, to the intent that they might hit two markes at one shoote, that is, take reuenge of such as they hated, and gaine the dead paies of such as were there slaine; which was an infernall inuention. And this I would not haue set downe if I had not heard it most constantlie affirmed by some of those themselues, that haue been of purpose sent to such banquets, and haue with great daunger escaped out of such enterprises. And whereas there is nothing more requisite to keepe men of warre in obedience and discipline, than pay and good vsage of their Chieftaines, Coronells, Captaines, and other Officers, (which hath been the cause that in all well ordered warres both ancient and moderne, the Generalls, Chieftaines and Captaines, haue alwaies vsed to procure and liberallie to pay, or to see the same paied to their soldiers, without defrauding them of any part thereof:) so some of our such men of warre haue in those warres procured pay for their soldiers; but when they haue obtained and receiued it, they haue vsed diuers waies to defraude them of the same, but chieflie two, speciallie to be noted; of the which the first hath been, that presently vpon the receipt of their pay, (or els that they haue been assured that they should receiue the same) within a day or two daies after, they haue presentlie deuised some verie daungerous enterprise to employ their bands and companies in, to make proofe how manie in such exploytes should leese their liues, that they might enrich themselues by their dead p
                  •
               ies; during which employments, some of our such chiefe men of warre that deuised the same, remained in great townes feasting, banquetting, and carowsing with their dames. And their second policie and practise hath been, that they haue plainlie kept and conuerted (or rather peruerted) a great part thereof to their owne vses, lodging their soldiers dispersed and stragling in Villages, and in stead of pay haue suffered them to goe alla picoree, that was, to robbe and spoyle the Boores their friends: whereupon it came to passe, that the Boores fearing

such mercenaries more than their enemies, did arme themselues, and stoode vpon their gardes, in such sort, that at times it cost the liues of a great number of our braue Nation. And for Captaines, diuerse wayes to become Merchants, and chiefly in selling their bandes one to an other, as also in letting them to farme for a yearely rent vnto their Lieutenants, as if they were flockes of milch Ewes, it hath beene too often put in practise. And whereas also, all Generalls and Chiefetaines of all Nations of anie iudgement, vpon the approch of any Citie, Towne, or place fortified, haue vsed to approch the same with trenches, crosse-trenches, gabions, and diuerse other ordinary and extraordinary inuentions, (according vnto the scituation of the ground) for the preseruing, and sauing of the liues of their Souldiors, and that they haue not offered to giue any assault, vntill by the battery and effect of great Ordinaunce, planted vppon 
                  〈◊〉
                
               Caueleeres (by vs called Mounts) or by battery from the counterscarfe cut, and opened, the flankers of the bulwarkes, platformes, and reuelins haue beene taken away, and the Artillerie of the inward Mounts dismounted, and a sufficient breach in the Curtine made assaultable, with the drie or wet ditches filled to take away the effectes of Casamates, as also to make the entrance of the Souldiors into the ditches and breach more easie, and with lesse daunger; and otherwise with great order of their Armies of horsemen and footemen reduced into 
                  〈◊〉
                Squadrons and other formes, for the garde of their Campes and Field: So contrariwise, our such men of warre (being ignorant of all discipline Militarie) haue bene so prodigall of the liues of their Souldiors, that they haue diuers times sent them (as it were to the butchery) to giue assault to certaine skonces, and other such fortifications, without any such order of approach, or taking away any flankers, or making any breach.
            Besides that, in this later time (I meane within these very fewe yeares) most grosely and ignorantly in the time of Winter, with some thousandes of our braue English people, they laie

shooting off gunnes diuers weekes against some great Towne well fortified, with a broad and a large riuer nauigable being betwixt them, without anie other wayes besieging of it, their Campe lying in a wet moorish ground, where their soldiors in their watches and centinels stoode to the mid legges in dyrt & myre, with frost, snow, raine and mysts, and small store of victuall, and at their dislodging from thence, did dislodge stragling by bands, without any chiefetaine to direct and gouerne them. All which disorders cost the liues of some thousands of our gallant English Nation, the dead payes of the which so great numbers of souldiors so fondly and wilfully cast away, did redound greatly to the enriching of some of our such men of warre. And now in the same later time, when all things should by all reason haue beene reduced vnto order and discipline, because the nature of the warre was altered from mercenary and voluntary, to princely authoritie; I meane the Sommer before the Earle of Leicester went ouer, our such men of war that had serued diuers yeares before in those parts deuised a newe inuention, neuer heard nor read of before amongst any men of warre, but onely vpon some great lackes and extremities, and that was, that their Soldiors, in steade of pay with money, should be payed in Prouand, which was bread and cheese, and other such victuall of the best cheape and basest sort, and that taxed by measure; saying, that it was not conuenient that their Souldiors should receiue their owne payes, because they knewe not how to lay out their money, but that they would spend it idlely; which simplicity and ignorance, if it had beene in them (as it was not) they, and their officers, by good instruction should haue reformed the same. But such couetous men of warre, vnder that pretence (as though their Souldiours had beene either naturall fooles or children) did contrarie to all Militarie order put the greatest part of their Souldiors pay into their owne purses, allowing them great scarcity of Prouand. By which means it came to passe, that diuers thousands of their Souldiors in those plentifull Countries, partly by hunger, and partly by euill lodging, & altogether by the small care and misuse of our such men of

warre did perish. Besides that, great numbers of such their sicke and starued Souldiors, by the order of the Earle of Leicester, were in those partes embarked, and transported into Essex, Kent, and other partes of England, to recouer health, of which foresaid great numbers of miserable & pitiful ghosts, or rather shadowes of men, the Essex and Kentish carts and carters (that carried them) can testifie; of which, scarce the fortieth man escaped with life. Also, when any of their Soldiors, through the naughtines, or scarcitie of their victuall, or by their euill lodging, or by the pestering, or lying of two or three hundred of them together in some one Church, and so in diuers Churches, vpon the bare pauements, or vpon diuers other disorders, and misusages of some of our such men of war, fell sicke; our such men of warre presently did casse, and discharge them out of their bands for dead men, turning their Prouand money with all ouerplusses into their owne purses, procuring newe supplies of well apparelled, and lusty yong men out of England, to the intent to serue their owne turnes, and to consume people after people. All which marueilous disorders of some of our such men of warre against their Souldiors, contrary to all discipline Militarie, by them practized and vsed, with infinit others (which to rehearse would make a huge volume) were the occasion that manie thousands of the lustiest and dispost sort of our English people, were in those warres (as it were) wittingly and willingly cast away; besides great numbers, that at diuers times did choose rather to flie to the enemy than to serue vnder such cruell and disordered chiefetaines; And these wonderfull disorders, with innumerable others did continue and increase vntill such time as diuers yong Noblemen lately comming to take principall charges in those wars, as also diuers knights and Gentlemen of Noble and of Worshipfull houses, and themselues of great valour and woorthines did complaine of, and discouer those most strange and wonderfull abuses, vnto the Queene, and to her Counsell; who vnderstanding thereof, did very nobly reforme and redresse diuers of those disorders, taking further order, that the aforesaid newe deuised Prouand should be abolished, and that in

steade thereof, the Souldiours should receiue their owne payes in money; which, with the wise and worthie proceedings and courses of the aforesaid Noblemen, Knights and Gentlemen, that began with great order and Discipline, to serue in those warres, some at, and others since, the going ouer of the Earle of Leicester, hath of late greatly preuailed and redounded to the reformation of diuers of those strange inuentions, and abuses, inuented and brought into those warres by the aforesaide newe fantasied men of warre.
            But now, for excuse vsed by some of our such men of war, for the casting away and losse of such great numbers, and many thousands of our gallant English people in those Lowe countrie warres, as also in later wars, (I meane not in France, where I neuer heard any blame, but great honour imputed to the Chiefetaine, and commendation to the Captaines; but in a very short warre of a great deale further distance, but of a wonderfull consumption of our braue Nation, through great disorder, and lacke of discipline Militarie: the particularities whereof, because I haue not hitherto handled, I omit) some of our such men of warre haue not beene ashamed, manie times to report and say, that all those braue people that haue beene consumed and lost in the Lowe Countries, and those other fore-mentioned warres, by their disorders (as aforesaid) were the very scomme, theeues, and roges of England, and therefore haue beene very well lost, and that the Realme (being too full of people) is very well ridde of them, and that if they had not beene consumed in those warres, they would haue died vnder a hedge, with diuers other such brutish and infernall speaches, euen like vnto themselues, and to the newe discipline by them inuented and practized, rather to dispeople a kingdome of England of the youth and floure thereof, than anie wayes to doo anie hurt vnto the enemie. Whereas contrariwise it is very welknowen vnto all the Iustices of peace in al shires of England, from whence those Souldiors did go voluntarie, or otherwise, euen from the beginning of the first voluntarie warres, vntill this day, (sauing such as were leuied in the Citie of London by commission, and some fewe roges in one

yeare leuied in other shires) that they were in a verie great part yong Gentlemen, and in a farre greater part of Yeomen and Yeomens sonnes, and the rest of the brauest sort of Artificers, and other lustie yong men, desirous of a gallantnes of mind, to aduenture themselues, and see the warres, many thousands of the which (being the verie floure of England) did farre exceed, and excell our such men of warre both in goodlines of personage and worthines of mind; and these were no roges, nor theeues, nor the scomme of England, as those our such men of warre doo ofttimes report: for it is verie well knowne in all shires by experience, that such malefactors and base minded people, neuer had any desire, nor will to go into anie warres and actions Militarie, but haue hidden and absented themselues away during the times of musters and leuies, and when the same haue been past, they haue againe followed their vile occupations of robbing, pilfering and stealing. Besides that, it is most manifest, that before some of our such men of warre tooke those voluntarie warres in hand, there were verie few theeues and roges in England, in cōparison that there are now, that haue come out of their discipline; for it is certaine, that this new deformed Milicia and euill gouernment of our such men of war, by suffering their soldiers for lacke of pay in those warres to go a robbing and spoyling the countrie people their friends (as aforesaid) hath brought many of them from good to euill, and made most of those that haue returned into England impudent roges and theeues, that were true men before they went ouer. By which their merueilous disordered, and deformed discipline, it is come to passe that many, and many thousands of the brauest and lustiest sort of people able to weare armes, and to serue in any warres either offensiue or defensiue, are (as aforesaid) consumed in those warres, and the number of exercised and expert soldiers, meete vpon any occasion to serue the Prince and Realme, by those seruices no waies increased; by reason that all such as haue come out of those seruices (vnlesse it be the Captaines, and a fewe Officers of bands) are almost all turned from miserable soldiers that they were in those Lowe Countries, to most impudent roges and theeues, that by no order,

nor pollicie can be reformed and reduced to any honest course of life, all which hath come to passe through the extreme euill gouernement of some of our such men of war (as aforesaid.) And whereas they talke and boast so much of their new discipline Militarie, and of their owne sufficiencies, and that they doe exceede and excell all the ancient men of war of times past, as also such as are yet liuing: Certainely, all men that list may beholde their newe Milicia of their owne forming, as aforesaid, of theeues and roges that doe swarme in all the high wayes, and gaoles of England. Which doth make manifest the great insufficiencies of such as haue beene Authors, actors and performers of that infernall discipline: some of the which also haue not contented themselues to worke the aforesaid great euills to their Countrie and Nation (before declared) but haue of late yeares, since they came out of those Lowe Countrie warres sought to bring to passe two other such notorious and deformed effectes amongst the English Nation, as may in time to come, be the vtter ruine of this most noble kingdome and people; euen as the like hath beene of diuers other great Monarchies: of the which two effects, the one hath beene to celebrate; the other to abolish and extinguish. That to celebrate, hath been to the feasts of Bacchus, with carowsing and drunkennesse. Which most foule and detestable vice, is enemy to all Discipline and Exercises Militarie, and to be short, to all vertues and excellencies both of bodie and soule, and in the rest is the very mother and nurse of effeminacie, of cowardice, of sensualitie, of rebellion, of couetousnes, and all other vices that can be imagined; as we may euidently see by our next neighbours the Flemings, and Dutch, whose vices and imperfections (sauing onely their pollicie to grow rich, and gather goods) for breuities sake I ouerpasse. And this forren vice hath bene brought out of those Lowe Countries by some of our such men of warre within these very fewe yeares, whereof it is come to passe, that nowadayes there are very fewe feastes, where our said men of warre are present, but that they doo inuite, and procure all the companie, of what calling soeuer they be, to carowsing and quaffing; and because they wil

not be denied their challenges, they will with many new conges, ceremonies and reuerences, drinke to the health and prosperitie of Princes; to the health of Counsellors, and vnto the health of their greatest friends both at home and abroad; in which exercise they neuer cease till they be dead drunke, or as the Flemings say, Doot dronken. Which their quaffings, and carowsings, with all their ceremonies, is no other but a blaspheming and offending of God in the highest degree, a touching of the honour of the Princes, vnto whose healths they carowse, and a very offering of sacrifice vnto Satanas, or rather to Belzebub himselfe the Prince of feendes. Certainely, a wonderfull pitifull case, that anie of our such men of warre or nation vnder the pretence of souldiorie, and warlike Discipline, should nowadayes in steade of praying to God, for the health of Princes, which hath beene alwayes very commendably vsed amongst all good subiects, Christians, drinke and carowse drunke to the health, & prosperity of Kings, Kingdoms, and States; And that men that haue beene created by God to his owne similitude and likenes, should contrarie to his glorie, by such filthie disorder make themselues farre inferiour to most brute beasts. And this aforesaid detestable vice hath within these sixe or seuen yeares taken wonderfull roote amongest our English Nation, that in times past was wont to be of all other Nations of Christendome one of the soberest; And this is one of the fruits and merchandize of their discipline that our such men of warre haue brought in amongst vs.
            Now, the other effect that they haue sought most blindlie and maliciouslie to bring to passe, to the great daunger that vppon diuers accidents may hereafter happen to the Crowne and Realme of England and English Nation, hath been, and is to seeke to abolish and extinguish the notable exercise and vse of our Long-bowes and Archerie; by which weapons our auncestors, with many miraculous victories, haue made our Nation famous both in Europe, Affrick and Asia, so that in stead of Archerie, which is the soberest exercise of all others to auoide drunkennes and other euills, and a most manlie exercise and wholesome for the health of the bodie, and to encrease

strength; and for battailes and victories of farre greater effect, than any other weapon that euer was or shall be inuented; our such men of warre vnder pretence of the excellencie of the weapons of fire by them misreported, would bring in carowsing and drunkennes: which two things, I meane of the neglecting and suppressing of the vse and exercise of Bowes and Archerie, and bringing in of superfluities and drunkennes, hath been the ruine of manie great Empires, Kingdoms and Commonwealthes, as it is apparant by the testimonie of many notable histories. As for example, the Aegyptians (before mentioned in this Proëme) vnder their most valiant and mightie King Sesosis or Sesostris, and other their notable Princes, did conquer a great part of Asia, Europe & Affrick by their notable Milicia, which did consist most of Archerie and Bowes: but after, through long peace, and the negligence of some of their effeminate Kings, the same warlike Nation did growe to such drunkennes and gluttonie, that thereby forgetting the vse and exercise of their Bowes, they were conquered and subdued Alexander the great, the greatest part of whose Armie did consist of Archerie, and after that many times subdued and kept in seruitude by the Milicia and force of Archerie of diuers other sober Nations. The Empire of Constantinople, and Rome also at such time as they were vnder one Empire, and that the Emperours held their imperiall seate in Constantinople, as carefull as some of those Emperours were to keepe their subiects the Grecians in exercise of Armes, and chieflie of Archerie, yet after in the time of other Emperours that were careles and effeminate, their subiects giuing themselues, through long peace, vnto feasting and drunkennes, and neglecting the exercize of Bowes and Archerie, did so forget the vse of that most excellent weapon, that they were many times vanquished by the Milicia of the Arabians, that consisted most of all of Bowemen: which conquering Nation at that time gaue themselues to labour and trauell, and to the exercise of their bowes, with great sobrietie, and not to drunkennes. And the subiectes of the very same Empire of Constantinople long after the time of their great ouerthrowes by

the Arabians, through the negligence of some of their effeminate Emperours, as aforesaide, were by the constraint of certaine imperiall statutes and ordinances of some other wise and valiant Emperours, reduced in a great, part from their drunkennes to sobrietie, and from idlenes to their ancient exercize of Archerie, by the which they did defend themselues against the Turkes and Sarazins (during the time of those woorthie Emperours) very valiantly; but after againe in processe of time, through the effeminacie and negligence of other Emperours of no valour nor worthines, the said Grecians did returne againe to their former drunkennes, superfluities, and vtter forgetting of the vse, and exercize of their bowes and Archerie. Whereby it came to passe, that Mahomet the second of that name of the house of Otoman, with his notable Milicia of Turkes and Ianissaries, that consisted most of Bowemen (a Nation no wayes giuen to drunkennesse) did vtterly subdue and conquere that Empire. Besides which examples, I coulde (if it were not too long) alleadge many others of many kingdomes, and mighty Nations, that through the detestable vices of drunkennes, couetousnes and superfluities, haue giuen themselues to effeminacie; and forgetting of all vse of their Bowes and Archerie, and other exercises Militarie: by meanes whereof they haue bene after conquered, and brought into seruitude by other sober and valiant Nations, that haue had the vse of the Bowe in great perfection. And to be briefe, there is no man that hath read many notable histories of great antiquitie, as also of later ages with obseruation, but hee shall most manifestly see, that drunkennes, couetousnes and superfluities, haue caused the forgetting and contempt of the vse of Archerie, and all other exercises Militarie, which hath beene the ruine of most of all the Empires, Kingdomes and Nations that haue beene knowne, or written of in Europe, Affrick, or Asia; And if any of our such men of warre be so obstinate, that they wil not beleeue such notable Histories, let them then resorte to the Bible, which is the Booke of God, and then (if they be not possessed with some infernall spirit, that doth breed in them infidelitie) they shall not onely there see the great account,

that King Dauid that holie prophet made of that weapon after the ouerthrow and death of King Saul, slaine by the Philistines, great effectes perfourmed with that weapon by the Iewes vnder Iosuah their most excellent Captaine, that did depose so many Kings; with many other particularities: by the which it may be iustly gathered, that God gaue such excellent effects to that weapon, that when he diuers times promised helpe to the Iewes against the Gentiles, hee made speciall mention of that weapon. And when it pleased him to punish the Iewes for their idolatrie gluttonie, by the handes of the Gentiles, they receiued diuers ouerthrowes, by the effect of Bowes. Besides that, King Dauid dooth call Bowes a mightie power, and in his Psalmes, the vessells of death. By which examples before alleadged (that drunkennes and neglecting of the exercize, and vse of Bowes, hath bin the ruine of many Empires and kingdomes) I thinke all men of consideration and iudgement may euidently see what pernicious and dangerous matters our such men of war haue by their euill and foule examples, and sinister perswasions, sought to drawe, and perswade our Nation vnto. Which with their innumerable disorders Militarie by them committed in the Lowe Countries, as also elsewhere, to the consumption, and destruction of many and many thousands of our Nation (as is before declared:) may, I thinke, euidently shewe how vnfit and vnable such men of warre are to compare themselues with the great Captaines of former times, or with the ancient men of war yet liuing, that haue bene trained vp in matters of armes in the warres of Emperours or Kings, as also how much more insufficient they are to erect and innouate anie new Discipline Militarie amongst vs, or any wayes to suppresse or find fault with the exercise, vse, and effectes of our peculiar, and most victorious weapon the Long-bowe.
            And now that I haue in this Proëme laid open many foule & detestable proceedings & disorders of some of our such mē of war, practised and put in execution by them in the Low coū
               tries, as also some here at home, greatly to the hurt & preiudice of our country & Nation: I thinke it good to notifie vnto your

Lordships, that I haue not taken it in hand, & performed the same any waies moued therunto vpō any priuat hatred or malice by me to anie of them borne. For I protest, that if they were all my verie neere kinsmen, the cause being publique, I would respect them no more than I haue respected these; but as for those men whosoeuer they be, to my remembrance, I haue had verie little or no conference with anie of them. Besides that, there is none of them, to my knowledge, that euer gaue vnto me (in respect of mine owne particular) anie occasion of offence: but the verie originall and principall cause that hath mooued me to set downe my discourses following, as also this my Proëme to your Lordships in this forme and phrase, hath been the exceeding loue, and extraordinarie zeale that I beare vnto my Prince, Countrie and Nation. That seeing and foreseeing the wonderfull euills that haue alreadie, and are likelie daylie, and from time to time more and more to ensue (if the same bee not speedilie prouided for and remedied) to no lesse in processe of time, thā to the ruine or great hazard of this most noble Monarchie; I therefore thought it my duetie, all priuate passion of feare, of loue, of hatred and affection set aside, to make manifest vnto your Lordships those great disorders and euills before declared; that by your being put in remembrance, and knowing of them your Lordships (being the Nobilitie and Magnates of the Kingdome, and the verie eyes, eares, and of the King, and the bodie of the watch, and redresse of the Common wealth) may prouide for, preuent, and reforme the aforesaid great euills that doo threaten hereafter to ensue: al which haue come to my knowledge by the certaine and assured reports of verie many both wise and gallant Gentlemen of principall houses, and others of verie good sort, that haue serued some of them at one time, and some of them at other times, euen from the first voluntarie going ouer into those warres, till within these two yeares and a halfe, and within these three yeares last past; all which Gentlemen haue greatlie detested those aforesaid infinite disorders.
            And now, because that no Chieftaine, Coronell, nor Captaine, that haue in those warres gouerned themselues and their

charges with great care, reputation and worthines (and therefore deserued great praise, and commendation) shall iustly think themselues any waies reproached or touched, by any thing contained in this my Proëme or discourses following; I notifie vnto them that no part of my intention nor meaning, nor any word to my knowledge in these contained, doo any waies sound to the touch or blame of any such worthie men, but altogether to their praise and commendation: for I would be sorie to erre so greatlie, as any waies to touch with blame anie men of worthines, but rather with my word, writing and action, to encrease their reputations; for if I haue in respect of the publique cause touched our such men of warre aforesaid, with reproach, they themselues vpon a guilty conscience, will discouer who they are, by blaming and detesting my Proëme and discourses, by the which the honor and vertue of such men of worthines shall shine, and flourish the more through the cleerenes of their consciences not touched, according to the old saying, that the reproching of vice is the honoring of vertue: for in troth, mine intention in this my Proëme, and discourses, hath been onlie to discouer the great disorders, and euils that some men of charge of our Nation (vnder pretence of a new discipline Militarie by them inuented in the Lowe Countries) did with great couetousnes practise, and exercise, to their owne gaine and profite in that their disordered Milicia, neglecting and contemning all true honor, reputation and worthines, to the great dishonor of our Countrie, and Nation. That thereby all yong Gentlemen that haue mispent their times in those tumultuarie, and disordered warres without anie discipline, as also all other yong Gentlemen that are desirous to followe the profession of Armes may reiect, and detest such newe disordered, and detestable disciplines, and reduce themselues, and followe the true discipline Militarie of all warlike and worthie Nations both ancient and moderne, which do all concurre and conforme in one; and that is, that all true and vniuersall disciplines Militarie doo (as I haue learned by hearing the opinions of diuers great Captaines, as also by reading diuers histories) brieflie consist as folweth. That be he Emperour King, or a Lieutenant generall of

an Emperour, or of a King that doth commaund and gouerne an Armie.
            First of all, that he doo make God to be loued, feared and serued throughout his whole Armie: the second, that he doo knowe how to commaund and gouerne, with great prouidence, care, order and iustice, and by rewarding the good, and punishing the bad, and by keeping his whole Armie in discipline to make himselfe to bee no lesse loued than feared. The third is, often to consult with his counsell, and to know, how of himselfe (after the opinions of his counsell heard) with valour to resolue and performe, and in the rest, himselfe to know vpon all doubtfull occasions and acccidents, how to preuent, remedie and execute, as also to direct others with great skill and dexteritie. And these are the most principall poynts that doo belong to the Generall of an Armie.
            The sufficiencie of Coronells doth consist in the gouerning of their Regiments with all care, valour, affection and diligence; and that they doo make their Regiments as well in particular bands, as in the whole bodie of the same, to obserue all orders Militarie in lodging, dislodging, in marching, and in fighting, as also that they doo liue in great order, without stragling, spoiling or any waies iniuring: And in the rest, that the Coronells themselues doo with all obedience.
            The sufficiencie of Captaines, doth consist in knowing how to gouerne and order their bands and Companies, & to winne the loue of their soldiers, by all examples of vertue and worthines, not onlie by instruction, but also by action in their owne persons, accompting of their soldiers as of their owne children. And in the rest to be obedient, valiant and resolute, as also of sufficiencie to performe and execute all commandements and directions with discretion, valour and iudgement.
            The duetie and sufficiencie of soldiers, doth first and principallie consist, to be obedient to their Captaines, and all other their superiour Officers. The second, that they doo knowe how

to apparell and arme themselues fitlie, and to handle and vse their weapons in euerie time and place, and to knowe and obserue al orders Militarie. The third is, to be sober, patient, and able to endure labours and trauells.
            The sufficiencie of all higher and lower Officers of Armies vnder the Generall, is to knowe how to performe their Offices with all care, fidelitie, diligence and obedience.
            And such a Prince or Lieutenant generall of an Armie, as hath those sufficiencies in him (that I haue before mentioned) cannot faile to frame good Officers of his Campe & Armie, as also good and sufficient Coronells and Captaines. And such Officers, Coronells and Captaines cannot faile to make good soldiers: All which, with the seruing of almightie God, tendeth to the orderlie proceeding and managing of a warre in all affaires and actions to the end of the same with victorie.
            And this that I haue aboue set downe, is a principall part of a Milicia, and discipline Militarie of all warlike Nations; and the contrarie is tumultuarie, and cleane opposite to all Arte and Science Militarie. And this I haue written in the end of my Proëme for a note and remembrance, for all yong Gentlemen of our Nation, that haue a desire to winne honour by following of actions of Armes. And now I proceed to my discourses.

            Certen Discourses concerning the formes and effects of diuers sorts of weapons; and other very important matters Militarie, greatlie mistaken by diuers of our men of warre in these daies; and chieflie of the Mosquet, the Caliuer, and the Long-bowe, as also of the great sufficiencie, excellencie, and wonderfull effects of Archers, with manie notable examples, and other particularities. Composed by Sir Iohn Smythe, Knight. 1589. And printed 1590.
            
               THe straunge opinions, so wonderfullie mistaken in these our daies in al matters Militarie, by diuers of our chiefe men of charge and warre, (as they are accompted) that haue learned their greatest skill in matters of Armes, seruing vnder the States, in the tumultuarie, licentious, and staruing warres of the Low Countries, or peraduenture some little in the ciuil warres of France, haue moued me to take in hand this discourse, to discouer their straunge and erronious opinions Militarie, by them published to our Nobilitie and chiefe Magistrates, as also to all the better sort of our people and Nation; which vppon anie important warre, either offensiue or defensiue, may greatlie redound to the losse and daunger of our Prince, Countrie and Nation. In the which discourse,

my meaning is not to touch the reputation of diuers of our auncient braue Captaines and Soldiers, who were men of good skill and sufficiencie before they entred into those warres, nor yet the reputation and honor of diuers Noble men,No Noble nor worthie men, anie waies intended to be touched in this discourse. as also Gentlemen, of noble or worshipfull houses, that of very late yeres haue entred into those seruices, rather to win reputation, knowledge and honor, than for anie hope of gaine, or spoyle; of the which there be diuers that by the testimonie of their honorable actions, and gouernment of themselues, and the charges vnto them committed, haue deserued great praise and honour; but onelie to touch with blame and discommendation, such, as attaining (I wot not how) to the highest places of office & charge to commaund our English Nation in those parts, haue through their couetousnes, and lacke of loue towards the soldiers of their Nation, so corrupted, or rather (as much as in them hath lien) subuerted all discipline Militarie, to the great losse and dishonor of our Countrie and Nation, that neither they themselues, nor anie of their imitators, are worthie to bee accompted in the number of men of warre, and much lesse to be esteemed by men of experience and iudgement in actions Militarie, to bee anie waies worthie to commaund and gouerne soldiers. In this discourse (also) I meane not at this time to meddle with the infinite nūbers of disorders Militarie by them committed in the Lowe Countrie warres, where they made a farre greater warre vpon our people & Nation, than vpon the Enemies of our Countrie; but to handle diuers abuses of theirs, and chieflie, the abuses that they haue sought to bring our

Nation into by mistaking of fortification, and of the effects of diuers weapons out of their due times and places, attributing to some weapons such effects as are not to bee performed with them, and detracting (most ignorantlie) the excellent effects of our peculiar and singular weapon the Long Bowe, seeking by extolling the effects by them misreported and mistaken of the Mosquet and Caliuer, to make our Nation beleeue that our Long Bowes haue vtterlie lost their auncient effects, and therefore no more to be vsed, but to be vtterly suppressed and extinguished, with diuers other grose errors, contrarie to all reason and experience Militarie of all auncient and moderne warlike Nations. The most of the which that shall fall into my memorie, I will (with the help of almightie God) answere in such sort, as all men of experience and iudgement in matters of Armes, that haue serued in Armies and Campes formed, either of Emperours, Kings, or Common wealths, shal easilie discouer their lacke of experience and knowledge in matters Militarie. And therefore I will begin with one of their toyes, and so proceed to greater matters.
            These our such men of warre before mentioned, in a manner, vtterlie ignorant of all our auncient discipline and proceedings in actions of Armes, haue so affected the Wallons, Flemings, and base Almanes discipline, (as some of them terme it) that they haue procured to innouate, or rather to subuert all our ancient proceedings in matters Militarie, and therefore haue left nothing in a manner vntouched, without seeking to alter and chaunge the same: as for example; They will not vouchsafe in their speaches or writings to

vse our ancient termes belonging to matters of warre,Vaine innouation of our ancient termes of warre. but doo call a Campe by the Dutch name of Legar; nor will not afoord to say, that such a Towne, or such a Fort is besieged, but that it is belegard: Their Ensignes also they will not call by that name, but by the name of Colours, which terme is by them so fondly & ignorantly giuen, as if they should be apposed as yong scholers in their accidens, and should (in stead of Ensignes) be asked how manie Colours of footmē there were in the Armie by Remenen vnder the Count Boissu against Don Iuan d' Austria, they must then either answere, a hundred, or more or fewer, as white, black, blewe, greene, yellowe, russet, &c. or els forsake their newe terme of Colours, and say so manie Ensignes, Bands, or Companies, which in troth is no direct answere to the question. The bodie of the watch also or standing watch (as we were wont to terme it) they now call after the French, or Wallons, Corps du gard, with manie other such Wallon and Dutch termes, as though our English Nation, which hath been so famous in all actions Militarie manie hundred yeres, were now but newlie crept into the world, or as though our language were so barren, that it were not able of it selfe, or by deriuation to affoord conuenient words to vtter our minds in matters of that qualitie.
            
               They fondlie scorne our ancient manner of arming.But that which is more strange, these our such new fantasied men of warre doo despise and scorne our auncient arming of our selues both on horseback and on foote, saying that wee armed our selues in times past with too much armour, or peeces of yron (as they terme it). And therefore their footmen piquers, they doo allowe for verie well armed when they weare

their burgonets, their collars, their cuirasses, and their backs, without either pouldrons, vambraces, gauntlets, or tasses.
            Their Horsemen also, and themselues seruing on horsebacke with Launces, or any other weapon, they thinke verie well armed with some kind of headpeece, a collar, a deformed high & long bellied breast, and a backe at the proofe; but as for pouldrons, vambraces, gauntlets, tasses, cuisses, and greues, they hold all for superfluous. The imitating of which their vnsoldierlike and fond arming, cost that noble & worthie Gentleman Sir Philip Sidney his life, by not wearing his cuisses, who in the opinion of diuers Gentlemen that sawe him hurt with a Mosquet shot, if he had that day worne his cuisses, the bullet had not broken his thigh bone, by reason that the chiefe force of the bullet (before the blowe) was in a manner past. Besides that, it is a great encouragement to al forraine Nations their Enemies that are better armed, to encounter with them and their soldiers that they see so ill armed. And as their ill arming is an encouraging to the Enemie, so it is vnto them a discouragement, and a great disaduantage. For in case anie horseman or footman piquer so ill armed, should bee wounded on the thigh, or chieflie on the arme or hand, either with Launce, Pique, Sword, or any other weapon, his fighting for that day were marred; besides that, by such wounds receiued, he is put in hazard either to bee slaine or taken. And to the same effect it hath been a maxime in all ages amongst all great Capraines, and skilfull soldiers, that the well arming of horsmen and footmen is a great encouragement vnto them to fight

valiantlie; whereas contrariwise being euill armed, it is a great discouragement vnto them encountring with well armed men, and most commonlie through wounds receiued, the verie occasion that doth make them to turne their backes.
            And as they doo mistake the conuenient arming of horsemen and footmen, so they also mistake the weaponing of them: for whereas Swords of conuenient length, forme and substance, haue been in all ages esteemed by all warlike Nations, of al other sorts of weapons the last weapon of refuge both for horsemen, and footmen, by reason that when al their other weapons in fight haue failed them, either by breaking, losse, or otherwise, they then haue presentlie betaken themselues to their short arming Swords and Daggers, as to the last weapons, of great effect & execution for all Martiall actions: so our such men of warre (contrarie to the auncient order and vse Militarie) doo now a daies preferre and allowe that armed men Piquers,Their mistaking of swords should rather weare Rapiers of a yard and a quarter long the blades, or more, than strong short arming Swords; little considering (or not vnderstanding) that a squadrō of armed men in the field being readie to encounter with another squadron, their Enemies, ought to streighten and close themselues by frunt and flanckes, and that after they haue giuen their first thrush with their Piques, and being come to ioyne with their enemies frunt to frunt, and face to face (and therefore the vse & execution of the piques of the formost rancks being past) they must presentlie betake themselues to the vse of their Swords and Daggers; which they cannot with any celeritie draw,

if the blades of their Swords be so lōg: for (in troth) armed men in such actiōs, being in their rancks so close one to another by flanckes, cannot draw their Swords if the blades of them be aboue the lēgth of three quarters of a yard, or a little more: besies that, Swords being so long, doo worke in a manner no effect, neither with blowes nor thrusts where the is so great, as in such actions it is; as also, that Rapier blades being so narrow, and of so small substance, and made of a verie hard temper to fight in priuat fraies, in lighting with any blow vpon armour, do presently breake, and so become vnprofitable. Horsemen also, & chieflie Lances, wearing their Swords by their sides (as Soldiors ought to doo) cannot readily drawe them without letting fall their bridles out of their left handes, if their Swords be aboue the length of three quarters of a yard, or a yard at the most, & yet that too lōg. All which cōsidered, their opinion of such long Swords, or Rapiers to be worne either by horsmen,Their mistaking of daggers. or footmen armed, is very ignorāt.
            Long heauie Daggers also, with great brauling Alehouse hilts, (which were neuer vsed but for priuate fraies and braules, and that within lesse than these fortie yeres; since which time through lōg peace, we haue forgotten all orders and discipline Militarie) they doo no waies disallow, nor find fault withall, but rather allowe them for their Souldiors to weare, than short arming Daggers of conuenient forme & substance, without hilts, or with little short crosses, of nine or ten inches the blades, such as not onely our braue Ancestors, but al other warlike Nations, both in warre and peace, did weare, and vse. By the which they euidently shew that they do very litle consider how ouer-burdensome

and combersome, such Alehouse Daggers are for all sorts of Souldiors both horsemen and footmen, as also how vnfit they are to be vsed with the point and thrust by Soldiors, Piquers or Halbardiers against their enemies in squadron. Where, by proofe, reason and experience, in al battailes and other encounters, the nerenesse and prease being so great, short, strong, and light arming daggers are more maniable, and of greater executiō amongst al sorts of armed men,I would wish that all the piques throghout England (that are for the field) shold be reduced into one vniformitie of lēgth, that is, either to seuenteene foote long by the rule, or else to eighteene foote, and not aboue, which are two foote longer thā the Spaniardes do vse in their milicia, & therewithall, I wold haue them to be made so light, & of very good wood, that they shold be both portable and maniable, which many of our piques at this present are not. than such long deformed Daggers, as aforesaid.
            
               Their mistaking of piques.Piques also (which are the strength of the field, as well against horsemen as footemen) they doo allowe of diuers lengths, so that they seeme long, hauing no regarde to their vniformitie of length, nor whether they bee portable or maniable, thorough their too much wood, or no; whereby they shewe the little skil they haue in the vse of that weapon, considering that Piquers being reduced into squadron to fight, should haue all their piques of one equall and proportionate length, to the intent that all the ranckes being closed by frunt and flanckes, either to charge an other squadron of Piquers their Enemies, or to receiue, and repulse a charge of Launces, all the points of the Piques of euerie rancke carrying one equalitie, and so diuerse ranckes being incorporated by frunt and flancke, with their Piques bent against their Enemies, may altogether giue a greater blowe to the repulsing either of horsemen or footemen, than if they were of diuerse lengths like Organe pipes, and thereby become of lesse force and resistance. Besides that, it is a verie vncomelie sight to see a square of Piquers enlarged in their ranckes to march, that the but-endes of their

piques through their disequalitie of length, should disorderlie precede one another. All which being neglected and contemned by our such men of warre, is by the Almanes, Zwitzers, Spaniards, and other Nations skilfull in the Arte Militarie, greatlie regarded.
            Halbards of the Italian fashion,Their mistaking of Halbards. with long poynts, short edges, and long staues, to bee placed within a squadron of piques, they doo better allow of, than of Halbards, or Battleaxes with short poynts, long edges, and short staues. In the which they shewe that they doo verie little consider or knowe, that when two squadrons doo encounter, and that the first thrush of piques being past, they doo presentlie come to ioyne with short weapons, as with Swords, Battleaxes, and daggers, and that then, weapons that are with long poynts, long staues, and short edges doo worke no effect, by reason that the rancks being so close, and nere by frunt and flankes in their distances, and the presse on both sides so great, as in such actions it is, they can haue no roume, to stand thrusting, and foyning with long Halbards, nor Piques, as our such men of warre doo imagine: but then is the time that the ranckes of short Halbards, or Battleaxes of fiue foote and a halfe long, with strong short poynts, short staues, and long edges in the hands of lustie soldiers that doo followe the first ranckes of Piquers at the heeles, both with blowe at the head, and thrust at the face, doo with puissant and mightie hand, work wonderfull effect, and carrie all to the ground. And of the great and excellent executions of such short Halbards and Battleaxes in battailes, our most worthie Auncestors, and diuers other warlike Nations had experience manie yeares

past, when they did vse to fight manie great battailes. Now peraduenture some not skilful in matters Militarie may happen to say, that such opinions in weapons mistaken is no great matter: howbeit they are much deceiued; for in matters Militarie there is no mistaking so small, that in true vnderstanding is not great, and chiefly the mistaking of weapons, with the which al effects & executiōs of warre are performed.
            
               Their mistaking of the conuenient heighth and length of Caliuers.Caliuers also (as they terme them) being of a greater length and heighth of bullet, and more ranforced than Harquebuzes, and therefore a great deale heauier, they doo better allow of, than they doo of light, well formed and ranforced Harquebuzes; alledging for their reasons, that Caliuers will carrie further poynt and blancke, and also giue a greater blowe than Harquebuzes. In the which they doo verie little consider, that neither Caliuers, nor Harquebuzes (considering their vncertaintie) are to bee vsed by anie skilfull soldiers with anie volees of shot against the Enemie in the field, aboue three or foure scores at the farthest, and that Harquebuzes within that distance will wound and kill aswell as Caliuers; besides that, through the lightnes and shortnes of them they are so maniable, that the Harquebuziers may skirmish a great deale longer, and with more dexteritie and certeintie, than the Caliuerers with their Caliuers, as also that vpon a hastie retraite they may verie well saue and keepe their peeces being so light, to the intent to make head againe, whereas the Caliuerers in such actions, through the ouermuch heauines of their peeces, doo most commonlie cast them away, and trust to their heeles: whereby with great reason it may be

concluded,Harquebuzes of conuenient heighth and length ranforced, better thā the ordinarie long and heauie Caliuers. that light Harquebuzes well formed of conuenient length, and ranforced, such as the olde bands of Italians and Wallons doo vse, are a great deale more maniable, more fit, and therefore of greater effect for soldiers to vse in the field, than our ordinarie and heauie Caliuers that our such men of warre doo so much allowe of.
            Now, some of our such men of warre that were of great offices and charge vnder the Earle of Leicester, that was Lieutenant Generall of the Queenes Armie at Tilburie this last sommer 1588. seeing the Essex regiment of 4000. footmen reduced into great bands of 400.500. and 600. to an Ensigne, vnder the charge and gouernment of Knights and Esquires of great worship, discretion, and desire to doo seruice to their Prince & Countrie, they perswaded him with great vehemencie, that it was verie meete and conuenient that all that whole regiment should bee reduced into bands of 150. soldiers to an Ensigne,Their mistaking of small bands to bee better than great. or into 200. at the most, and therewithall that all those small bands should bee committed to the charge of our trained Low Countrie Captaines (as they call them) of the which there were a great number attending, some of them more hungrie after charge, spoyle and gaine, than skilfull to do anie great seruice, or to win reputation, or the loue of their soldiers. And the chiefest reasons that they did alleage for reducing them into such small bands, were, that the Enemie by seeing so great numbers of Ensignes in the field, would iudge the Armie to bee verie huge, and great in numbers of men, and therefore redoubt them the more; besides that, by the imployment of such a number of trained

Captaines, the regiment, and so consequentlie all the whole Armie assembled and reduced into such small bands, should bee the more full of men of seruice and skill: which their reasons may seeme pretie to such as knowe verie little of matters Militarie, and that do not fall into the reckoning of their second meanings, which I omit. Howbeit, how vnsoldierlike perswasions and opinions these were, how vnprofitable for the Prince, and vnfit and vnreadie for seruices in the field, I will (by the helpe of almightie God) make euident.
            When the great Princes of Germanie, vppon anie occasion or iniurie offered, are disposed to make warre one against another, or vpon an imperiall Armie assembled to inuade, or resist the Turke, being bound (as they are) by their tenures Militarie to the Empire, some to finde horsemen, and others to finde footmen at their owne charges, they then vpon such occasions haue alwaies vsed, and do still vse, to forme their regiments of footmen into great bands of 500. to an Ensigne, and that they vse especiallie for two causes, the one thereby in their regiments, and so consequentlie in their whole Armies to saue the pay of a great sort of Captaines,The reasons and causes wherefore the Princes of Germanie doo vse great bands of 500. in their seruices of the Empire. Lieutenants of bands, Ensignbearers, and other Officers, which would bee greatlie encreased, and so amount to a farre greater charge and pay, in case they should compose smaller bands of 300 to an Ensigne, or vnder that number: the other cause that doth mooue them to forme their bands so great, is, that their milicia consisting of Harquebuziers, Piquers, and some Halbarders, with a fewe slath swords for the gard of their Ensignes, that those sorts of weapons,

by reason of the greatnes of the bands being in great compertiments and diuisions, may be more readilie and easilie drawne out and separated, and with a great deale more celeritie incorporated with the other great compertiments of the like weapons of other great bands, to forme their squadrons with sleeues, wings, troupes, or forlorne hopes (according to the order and direction of the Coronells, and Sergeants Maiors) than if their bands were smaller either of 300. or vnder that number, whereby the compertiments of weapons should be also the smaller, & thereby in number the greater, and so consequently would require a longer time, not onlie to drawe out, but also to incorporate compertiments with compertiments for the forming of battailes with sleeues, wings, and forlorne hopes, as aforesaid. Besides that, such great bands, both by reason and experience are as readie, or rather more readie to bee employed either in whole companies vnder their Captaines and Lieutenants, or diuided into parts and Corporolates vnder their Corporals and Sergeants for watches, bodies of watches, Centinells, and all other ordinarie, and extraordinarie employments & actions Militarie in Camp, Towne, or Field, than anie small bands are. Now, peraduenture some such as doo not vnderstand this order Militarie of the Princes of Germanie aboue mentioned, will say, that all the Regiments of footmen Almanes, that either the King of Spaine, or the French King haue hired and imployed anie waies in their warres, haue been but of 300. to an Ensigne, which is verie true; howbeit the cause thereof hath been, that when such Princes haue occasion to employ anie Mercinarie

regiments of Almanes,
               The cause wherefore the mercinarie Almane Coronells doo vse small bands of 300. in the seruice of forrain Princes. they do send their Commissaries into Germanie, to hire so manie Coronells as they will haue Regiments, in case that they had none before in their ordinarie stipends and pay; and those Coronells doo make choise of Captaines for the leauie of their Regiments, at their owne pleasures, and therefore will accept of no Captaines, but of such as will compound with them and buy their Captainship, so as the more bands the more Captaines, and the more Captaines the more compositions and profite; which peraduenture was the cause that moued some chiefe officer, or officers vnder the Earle (as imitators of the Almane Mercenaries) to perswade him to reduce all the great and honorable bands aforesaid, into little bands of 150. or 200. thereby to haue the more compositions and sommes of monie at our Lowe Countrie Captains hands, some of the which would not let to giue largelie to obtaine Companies, intending after by fleecing and ransoming of their soldiers being men of wealth, to pay themselues againe with great interest, which two or three daies before the breaking vp of the Campe, they verie pretilie did begin. Howbeit, it seemeth that such great Officers and perswaders, had little regarde to the profite of the Prince, nor yet to the reducing of the Armie with celeritie and dexteritie into squadrons and battailes, and other formes Militarie as aforesaid, considering that those small bands of 150. or 200. soldiers to an Ensigne, did consist of fiue different sorts of weapons, viz. Piques, Battleaxes, Mosquets, Harquebuzes, and Long Bowes, and that therefore euerie one of them was to bee reduced into fiue diuers diuisions, which

besides the vncomely sight to see so many small compertiments in euerie such little band, it would haue required a farre longer time vpon the dailie & ordinarie dislodging of an Armie reduced into Vaward, Battle, and Rereward, to haue drawne out so great a number of compertiments out of such a number of little bands, than out of bands of 500. to haue drawne a few great compertiments, and to haue encorporated and reduced them into anie forme Militarie. Now, whereas our such men of warre perswaded with the Earle, that the Enemie would iudge the greatnes of the Armie by the greatnes of the number of Ensignes, and therfore redoubt the more, & that by the number of such little bands vnder so manie trained Captains, the Armie should be so much the more full of men of seruice, it argueth the insufficiencie and lack of iudgment of such perswaders. For there is no Enemie skilfull in the Arte Militarie, that will iudge of the greatnes or smalnes of an Armie in the field, by the great or small number of Ensignes or peeces of Taffata, but by the frunts and flancks of the squadrons marching, and chieflie by good espialls, or by prisoners taken. And as for the dismissing and cassing of the Knights and Esquiers that were Captains of such honorable Companies, that such Lowe Countrie Captaines might haue supplied their places, vpon the diuiding of those great bands into hundreds and fifties, or into two hundreds, I thinke it had been a great deale more meete for the reasons before alledged, that all the whole Armie (if it had been farre greater than it was) for the defence of the realme, should haue been reduced into great bands of fiue hundreds, vnder the

charge of Knights and Esquiers, well chosen, and of great worship in their Countries, and that a great part of our such Lowe Countrie Captaines (
                  〈◊〉
                neuer knewe what discipline Militarie ment, nor yet what it is to command and gouerne, as it may well appeare by their infinite disorders in the Lowe Countries) should haue been distributed, and placed throughout those great bands as Sergeants, or Ensigne bearers vnder such discreet and worshipfull Gentlemen, to the intent that they might first learne to obey, before they should haue authoritie to commaund and gouerne the Yeomanrie of England.
            Now, whereas I haue heard of some of our auncient and most sufficient Captaines, that our English milicia of footmen manie yeares past, did consist of bands but of 100. to an Ensigne; and that I haue likewise heard by diuers old and notable Captaines Italians, that the Italian milicia also before the Emperour Charles, as also in the beginning of his time, did consist of bands of footmen but of 100. to an Ensigne, and that those bands of hundreds did consist euerie one of them but of one sort of weapon, as amongst the Italians of a hundred Piques, (sauing that of that number there were a verie fewe partisans for the garding of their Ensignes) and of a hundred Harquebuziers: so our bands of hundreds did also consist of 100. Archers, & of 100. Battleaxes, without composing them of diuers sorts of weapons, according to the moderne vse, which certainlie (in mine opinion, sauing onelie for the encrease of the charges of the Prince) was a verie conuenient order, considering that euerie sort of weapon being reduced into bands by themselues,

without compertiments of diuers sorts of weapons in anie one band (vnles it had been of Battleaxes with Piques, because those two sorts of weapons are to enter into the bodie of a squadrō) would haue wrought that the Sergeants Maiors, and other Officers of the field, might with great facilitie and celeritie haue reduced anie meane Armie into manie formes of battailes both to march and fight, as also that they might haue been lodged in their quarters with great order and readines in a Campe, or Campes formed.
            Now, whereas our such men of warre did perswade with the Earle for the reducing of the great bands of footmen into small companies of one hundred and fiftie (as is before declared:) so did they likewise perswade with him to reduce all those small bands into little Regiments of one thousand vnder euerie Coronell;Their mistaking of small Regiments to be better than great. by which their perswasions they did verie manifestlie shewe that they vnderstood verie little, for what causes and reasons Regiments were first instituted, and since amongst manie Nations continued: howbeit, I doo perswade my selfe by that which I haue heard, partlie from their own speaches, partlie also from others of verie great credite, that in all their proceedings in matters of warre, they do rather followe the newe fashions of the disordered warres of France, and the Lowe Countries vnder the States, than anie reason and experience Militarie. For in troth, bands of horsemen and footmen, of which Armies doo consist, were at the first reduced into Regiments for diuers causes, and chieflie for fiue.
            The first, that they might be the better & the more orderlie gouerned, and the more readie vpon all occasions

to be commaunded and imployed.
            The second, that they might be the better, and the more conuenientlie lodged in their quarters.
            The third, that they might bee the more orderlie and readilie placed in their watches, bodies of watches, and Centinells.
            The fourth, that they might for the defence of their Camp be the more readilie reduced into diuers puissant bodies of squadron by themselues, with sleeues and wings in the places of assemblie.
            And the fift, that vpon the dislodging of an Armie reduced into Vaward, Battle, and Rereward, diuers Regiments might the more orderlie and readilie incorporate, and reduce themselues into three mightie battailes, or more, according to the order and direction of the Lieutenant generall, or high Marshall of the field, or els of the Sergeant Maior Maior, by some called the Sergeant Maior generall.
            Now, the Launce-knights Almanes (which is the Nation of Christendome most skilfull of all others that euer I sawe, to performe these actions and effects before declared, with manie other matters Militarie both for the Campe & field) to the intent to performe al such actions with the more celeritie and dexteritie, haue vsed of great antiquitie to forme all their Regiments of footmen of tenne Ensignes to euerie Regiment, and so they did vse manie yeares past, when euerie one of their Regiments did consist of fiue thousand soldiers, at which time their bands did consist of fiue hundred to euerie Ensigne. And of later yeares they reduced their Regiments to bee of foure thousand, and their bands to be of foure hundred to an Ensigne.

And last of all, their Regiments to bee of three thousand, and so their bands to bee of three hundred to euerie Companie, which doth at this present continue, vnles it bee in the publique seruices of the Empire against the common Enemie the Turke, or in their owne priuate seruices, as is before declared.
            Now, if our such perswaders before mentioned were of so great consideration and iudgement, as they would seeme to be, they would verie well know that great Regiments of fiue, foure, or three thousands that doo consist of great bands of fiue, foure, or three hundreds, are a great deale more readie to be commaunded and gouerned, and therewithall to performe all actions Militarie, with a great deale more celeritie and dexteritie, than if they were reduced into little Regiments of thousands, & small bands of hundreds and fifties. And that may be with great facilitie considered by the like comparisons and reasons, which I haue before alleaged, that great bands of fiue hundreds, and so consequentlie by the like reasons of foure or three hundreds are more readie to bee reduced into forme, and imployed in all important seruices with more celeritie & dexteritie, than small bands of hundreds and fifties, or two hundreds are: Besides all which, by forming of such small Regiments of one thousand, the Prince doth consume a farre greater pay, than by forming of great Regiments of fiue, foure, or three thousand, by reason of the great number of officers, which are encreased by such great nū
               bers of little Regiments. And for further proofe and confirmation of euerie forementioned particularitie, I were able to alleadge manie more reasons, if it were

not to auoide prolixitie. Howbeit, peraduenture it may now be said vnto me, that the Tercios of the Spaniards that haue serued manie yeares in the Lowe Countries, doo consist some of them but of twelue hundred, and others of fifteene hundred, and some of more, and others of fewer, which I confesse to bee true, but that hath proceeded of this, that they are not entire Tercios, nor neuer were since they were drawne out of such principalities where they before were resident, as for example: when the Duke of Alba was to come out of Italie with his Armie, to suppresse the intestine tumults of the Lowe Countries, the whole Tercios of Sicilie, Naples, Sarden
                     •
                  a, and Lumbardy were not drawne out of those gouernmēts, but certen great parts of them, which notwithstanding were called by the names of Tercios, with additions of the names of the gouernments & principalities from whence they came, as though they had bin entire, whereas in troth they were but certen great parts of those Tercios. For a Tercio is not to bee holden for compleate of anie smaller number than of 3000. soldiers, according to the ordinarie regiments of Italians, Wallons, and other Nations that are in these daies of the like number.
            Caliuers and Mosquets for seruices in the field they extoll and magnifie,Their vaine opinions of the effect of Caliuers & Mosquets. and chieflie Mosquets, perswading as much as they can all Magistrates, and men of accompt, that battailes and victories in these our daies are to bee obtained chieflie by the force and excellencie of those weapons; and that the forraine Enemie seeking to inuade vs in anie Hauen with a Nauie and Armie royall, should with foure or fiue thousand Mosquettiers and some Caliuerers, bee repulsed

and kept from landing. And that certen Sconces by them deuised without anie Bulwarks, Flanckers, Trauesses, Mounts, Platformes, wet or drie Ditches in forme, with Counterscarps, or any other good forme of fortification, but onelie raised and formed with earth, turfe, trench, and certen poynts, angles, and indents, should bee able to hold out the Enemie landed some three or foure daies, vntill the force of three or foure shires were assembled. They also doo further attribute such excellencie vnto Mosquets, that no squadrons of horsemen or footmen, what number soeuer they haue of Archers, are anie waies able to abide the volees and terrour of that weapon, being in great numbers within 20. or 24. scores, but that they must of necessitie bee dismembred and broken. To the weapon of Caliuers before mentioned, they also giue exceeding commendation for skirmishes and encounters in the field, saying that they may skirmish with that weapon 10. or 12 scores of, to the great terrour and hurt of the Enemie. Vpon which excellent effects by them attributed to the aforenamed weapons of fire, they haue perswaded (as much as doth in them lie) that all our bands of late yeares erected for the defence of the Realme, should bee filled with manie Mosquettiers and Caliuerers, and fewe Piques, and for short weapons being Bils (which I call Battleaxes) they make small accompt.
            Now, for answere to some of these vnsoldierlike opinions, I say, that if anie such as doo hold that wonderfull opinion of the effects of Mosquettiers (how good soldiers soeuer they thinke themselues) were at anie Hauen in England with fiue or sixe thousand of

the best Mosquettiers that they euer saw of our English nation, without 
                  〈…〉
                of horsemen and footmen of other weapons to backe them, I thinke they would worke verie small effect against the Enemie landing, although they had ensconsed themselues (as they terme it) in such Sconses as they and their Enginers formed this last sommer 1588. vppon the Sea coasts of Suffolke, and in Essex and Kent, on both sides of the riuer of Thames. For if they should see a Nauie with an Armie of thirtie or fortie thousand men (besides seamen, and such as should be left for the gard of the shipps) vnder some notable and sufficient General enter into anie capable Hauen of England, with wind and weather fit for their purpose, with intention to inuade (which God forbid) they should finde themselues in their opinions wonderfullie deceiued. For this they are to knowe, that such a Generall being with his whole Nauie entred into such a Hauen, doth take order before, that proclamatiō be made throughout all his shipps and vessells, that no man vpon paine of death being landed, shall straggle or stray abroad, but all soldiers to reduce themselues with all celeritie vnder their Ensignes; which done, a Cannon is discharged out of the Generalls ship, which is a warning for all Captaines, Officers and Soldiers to arme themselues and to take their weapons. And vppon the second Cannon discharged, the Captaines, and Ensignbearers with their Ensignes in their hands, with such cōuenient numbers of Mosquettiers, Harquebuziers, Piquers, and Halbarders, as the long boates, Shallops, Fregatts, Azabres, and other such vessells of oares lying readie at the shipps sides are capable of, doo enter

into them, euerie long boate hauing two Bases aforeship readie charged, and gunners readie to discharge them. Then vpon the third Cannon discharged, all the long boates and vessells of oares for the landing of men, do rowe with all furie towards the land with a wonderfull terrible noise of trompets & drommes. Now, if our such men of warre with their Mosquettiers would giue their volees of Mosquet shot vppon these shipboates full of men, with intent to destroye great numbers of them being so thicke and so manie, they shall finde that discharging their Mosquet shot from higher grounds downwards into the sea, which by the Italians are called Botti di ficco, accompted of all other dischargings most vncertaine, as also by the ouermuch distance, and continuall motion of the shipboates rowing, and with the swelling of the salt water (how calme soeuer it bee) made more vncertaine, they shall shoote verie vncertainlie, & therefore work verie little or no effect to the destroying of their enemies, or anie waies to keepe thē from landing. Besides that, the Enemies out of such their shipps as are neerest vnto them, will discharge Cannon, Culuerin and Saker shot to the terrifying of them; so as their shipboates in despight of their Mosquets comming to land, and they presentlie sending certen troupes of Harquebuziers, with some Halbarders vnder their conductors, to skirmish and entertaine the Mosquettiers, whilest the Piquers and other weapons doo reduce themselues into forme vnder their Ensignes, they shall finde in the space of three or foure houres aboue twelue or fifteene thousand men landed; who then taking some ground of aduantage to fortifie, and

to place their victuall, powder, and all sorts of munitions, they with all speede possible do proceed to the landing of their Artillerie and Munitions, with all the rest of their Armie both of horsemen and footmen. Which being by them performed, they presentlie make their approach vpon their indented Sconce, not with anie crooked or crosse trenches, gabions, nor mounts, according to the order of approaching, and battering of places in forme fortified, but with other inuentions gardable against Mosquet shot (that peraduenture our such men of warre are ignorant of) as also with Mosquet and Harquebuze shot, with piques, and halfe piques, swords and targets, and with ladders if it be needful, in such terrible sort, as that great number of our vnskilfull Mosquettiers and Caliuerers within their Sconce, would be found scarse able to abide the first charge and assault, seeing so puissant an Enemie landed. And I doubt rather when they should see with what terrour the Enemies doo approach the land, and the small annoyance that they with their Mosquet shot should worke vppon them, that they would scarse abide the landing of the first boates full of soldiers, without abandoning both Sconce and shore to the Enemie.
            And whereas our such men of warre the last sommer had manie deuises in their heads of ensconcing of Sconces for the defence of diuers Hauens;A vaine opinion of insconsing of Sconces in the drie grounds of England. if they were men of vnderstanding in fortification (as they would seeme to be) they might verie well know that there is a great difference betwixt the scituations and natures of the drie grounds of England, and those of Holland, Frizeland, and other such low and flat Countries

full of riuers, great ditches, marishes, and wet grounds, where they may ensconce themselues with small cost within little Ilands, or vpon poynts & meetings of riuers▪ or elswhere, by the opening of sluces and dykes, or cutting of banckes and trenches, they may enuiron themselues with water on euerie side. The best sort of which Sconces being more strong by nature and scituation, than by anie arte or forme of fortification, may in those parts resist and hold out a weake or an vnskilfull Enemie some long while: but such their ensconcings in the drie grounds vpon the Hauens of England, are to small purpose to hold out a puissant Enemie, if he should land, or anie waies to keepe him from landing. And therfore I conclude, that such fortifications in England are verie skornes and mockeries, and would be rather profitable for the Enemie landed, than anie waies to annoy or to resist the Enemie. Besides all which before alleaged, it is further to bee noted, that a puissant and mightie Enemie that in the time of sommer intendeth the inuasion of forraine dominions by sea, to the intent to giue battaile and subdue, doth not alwaies binde himselfe to land his Armie in a Hauen, but sometimes vpon an open coast and shoare, if the sea (without hidden rockes and flatts) be deepe, and the wind and weather faire, hauing commoditie by the depth of the sea to approach his Nauie, and to cast ancker in open roade, neere vnto a commodious shoare & countrie to land and march vpon. So as it behoueth all such Princes, as doubt the inuasion of their dominions by sea, not onlie to expect and prouide for the resisting of the Enemie in their Ports and Hauens, but also to haue as

great regard to some such open and commodious shoares, as are before mentioned. Which cannot be performed 
                  〈◊〉
                with ensconcing of Sconces, 
                  〈…〉
               , but onelie with a great and extraordinarie wisedome, and with the valiant hands of a puissant Armie and Campe formed. Now, whereas they attribute such excellencie vnto Mosquettiers with their Mosquets, that being in great numbers, and backed with some squadrons of Piques,An vnsoldierlike opinion of the effects of Mosquets for seruices in the field. they are able 20 or 24. scores off to break and dismember squadrons both of horsemen and footmen; True it is, that Mosquets being in the hands of skilful Mosquettiers, are of great effect for diuers purposes; and that kinde of weapon of that length with restes, and so ranforced, was first vsed in Italie aboue 60. yeares past (as I haue diuers times heard auncient Captaines of the Italian and Spanish Nation say) and that at that time they were employed for the defence of places fortified, as also out of trenches against places fortified being besieged, which were the verie naturall places and of greatest effect for that weapon; howbeit, since that time they haue been vsed in most Armies in the field both on horsebacke and on foote,Mosquettiers on horsebacke were vsed in the Emperour Charles, and Henrie the French Kings times, to flank a square of Launces, and to giue a volee at another square of Laū
                  ces their enemies, and they did vse to weare halfe cuirasses, with rests of yron, to pull forward or put backward, to discharge their Mosquets frō. but chieflie on foote, but neuer in anie great number vntill the Duke of Alba came to gouerne the Lowe Countries; who greatlie encreased the nūber of that weapon for soldiers on foote. To the which encrease of Mosquettiers he long before had perswaded with the Emperour Charles, howbeit he could neuer bring it to passe, because there were diuers great & notable Captaines, such as the Marquesse of Guast, Don Fernando Gonzaga, Iuan Baptista Castaldo, Antonio Dorea,
               
and the Marquesse of Marin
                     •
                  an, with diuers other principall men of his councell of warre, that did vtterlie mislike the encreasement of that weapon for the field, as too burdensome and heauie for soldiers to vse in battailes or great encounters; but for within townes besieged, or out of trenches against places fortified, they did greatlie allow of them: But the Duke at this time being Lieutenant generall and absolute Gouernour in the Lowe Countries (as aforesaid) seeing the numbers of Rutters in all Armies encreased, and that the most of those Rutters, as also that manie Captaines and Officers of footmen were armed at the proofe of the Harquebuze, he to the intent to frustrate the resistance of their armours, did encrease his numbers of Mosquettiers, the blowes of the bullets of which, no armours wearable can resist. And this I haue heard of diuers auncient Captaines both Italians and Spaniards, who did rather allowe of the opinion of those great Captaines, than of the Duke of Albas so great encreasing of that weapō. Since whose time the Duke of Parma after the death of the Commendador and Don Iuan d' Austria, being appoynted by the King of Spaine to bee Lieutenant generall and gouernour there, seeing the greatest part of the Lowe Countries reuolted, and lost through Don Iuan d' Austrias composition; & that he was therfore to recouer citie after citie, and towne after towne, because they were all fortified more or lesse, and that when he had won them, he must keepe & defend them with garrisons; for the which two effects of winning & defending of townes & places fortified, that kind of weapō being verie excellent, he encreased his Mosquettiers

to a farre greater number (as I haue heard) than the Duke of Alba euer had. Howbeit, I knowe that the Duke of Alba had more cause to vse Mosquettiers in seruices of the field vpon diuers occasions, than anie of his successors gouernours of those Prouinces euer had, by reason of the often inuasions of Counte Lodowick, the Prince of Orange, and others; and therefore he being (as he was) a great Captaine, and of great experience and skill in all discipline and science Militarie, did vse to conferre with his Coronells, and Maestros de Campo, and Sergeants Maiors of the vse of all weapons in their due times and places, and of their distances in euerie sort, as of verie important matters belonging to the Arte Militarie; in such wise as there was not anie Captaine, Alferez, Sergeant of band, or Cabo de Esquadra, that did not knowe (both by instruction and practise) the particular operations and effects of all weapons, and chieflie of the Mosquet and Harquebuze, in which two weapons the Spaniards haue been accompted of manie yeares to bee most perfect and skilfull, in such sort as there were not anie Captaines or Leaders in his Milicia so ignorāt, that would permit their Mosquettiers to giue anie volees from their restes, either at horsemen or footmen in march, or anie motion, aboue 8. or 10. scores at the farthest, because they knewe (both by instruction and experience) that with that weapon (being for diuers causes verie vncertaine) they should in discharging farther of, haue wrought verie small or none effect to the anoyance of their Enemies. For although the Mosquet ranforced and well charged with good powder, would carrie a full bullet poynt and blancke 24. or 30.

scores,If Mosquettiers may giue effectuall volees 24. scores of (as it is fondlie reported) then some number of Archers being chosen, that could with their flights shoote 24. or 20. scores (as there be manie that can) may by the same reason giue volees of flights at their enemies 18. scores of, which both the one & the other are mockeries to bee thought of, because there is no weapon in the field effectuall, further than to a conuenient and certen distance. doth it therefore followe that they should giue volees of Mosquet shot 20. or 24. scores of? whereas in failing to take their iust sight at poynt and blancke no more but the length of a corne, their bullets doo worke as much effect against the Moone, as against the Enemie that they shoote at. Besides that, in so great a distance of ground, how truelie soeuer they take their sights at poynt and blancke, the ayre doth worke verie great effect with their bullets that are lower by a bore than the height of their peeces, to carrie them from the marke or markes that they are shot at. As also that by proofe they may finde, that in giuing their volees of Mosquet shot but onlie twelue scores, at either horsemen or footmen that are in motion, they shall worke no great annoyance, by reason that the bullets being so much lower than the heigth of their peeces (as is aforesaid) doo naturallie mount and flie vncertainlie. Besides that, no Mosquettiers in actions of the field can haue the time to charge their peeces and take their sights at poynt and blancke, as they may being within trenches, or from out of Bulwarkes, Curtins, and Rampiers in places fortified; where, with great leisure they may charge their peeces with full bullets and charges, and shoot from verie certeine rests, as it were de man puesto (as the Spaniards call it.) By which reasons and experiences of the vse of that weapon in the field, the lacke of experience and iudgement in our such men of warre, that talke of 24. or 20. scores like nouices and Vison̄os, may verie euidentlie appeare and giue occasion to anie such as haue seene the true effects thereof, to thinke that they neuer sawe anie important matter performed

with that kind of weapon in the field.
            Now, whereas they giue so great commendation to the Caliuer, that with that kind of weapon soldiers may giue volees of shot in the plaine fields 10. or 12. scores off, to the great annoyance both of horsemen and footmen; To that I answere, that it is a verie vnsoldierlike opinion, and contrarie to all experience and vse of old soldiers, and chieflie of the old bands of Italians, Spaniards, & Wallons, who by long experience do better knowe what effects both Harquebuzes and Mosquets of all heighthes doo work, than they doo. And because that by cōtinuall experience they know the wonderfull vncertaintie of those kinds of weapons in the field, they will neuer skirmish, nor otherwise giue anie volee aboue 10.20.30. or 40. paces off at the farthest, although it bee at a whole squadron or troupe of horsemen or footmen: sauing that true it is, that the old soldiers Harquebuziers Spaniards, seeing their enemies in the field some 8.9. or 10. scores off, by the commandement of their officers doo sometimes giue a verie fewe shot at their enemies, with no other intent but to abuse and procure them to giue their volees with all furie, that thereby they may spend their powder and bullets, heate their peeces, and worke no effect, whereby they still keeping the force of their shot, may after giue their whole volees at their enemies, approaching within 10.15. or 20. paces; and for that effect the Spaniards doo vse this phrase;This phrase may be interpreted, discharge a farre of, to draw on, and deceiue dotterells.
                
               disparese de lexos, para atraher, y engan̄ar bobos, which our such men of warre may truelie confesse, if euer they sawe, and encountred with anie puissant numbers of those Nations in the field.
            
               Now, because they doo so much mistake the effects of those two weapons of fire, the Mosquet and Caliuer, attributing such excellencie vnto them for the field, as is not to be performed with them, thereby to bring our Magistrates, and the better sort of our people & Nation into misliking of our ancient weapon the Long Bowe, wishing the vtter extinguishing of that kind of weapon as vnprofitable and of none effect for the warrs of these our daies, I will set down the perfections and imperfections both of the Mosquet, Caliuer and the Long Bowe, attributing vnto each one of them the true effects, that by commō experience and reason haue been, and may be wrought with euerie sort of them in the field, that by comparing the perfections, imperfections, and effects of the soldiers, and their weapons of fire, with the perfections, imperfections, and effects of the Archers & their Bowes, all men of consideration and iudgement (bee they soldiers or men of peace) may iudge which of those three sorts of weapons are of greatest effect for battailes and great encounters, and other actions in the field, and not in places fortified.
            And therefore beginning with Harquebuzes, by many miscalled Caliuers: which Harquebuzes if they bee well ranforced, and the Cannons of them not aboue a yard in length, and the bore & bullets not too great, with stocks of good forme, I think them to be verie maniable weapons, for such soldiers as are well practised,The proper times and places for Harquebuziers. & do know how to vse them, & do worke most effect in woods, and whereas vines or shrubs do grow, & from behind old ruined walls, as also whereas there be trenches, deepe waies, bancks, hills, rocks,

or hedges, or anie other couert, where they may lie close, and finde anie thing to serue them for rests to discharge their peeces from, and so vpon the sodaine giuing volee after volee are of great seruice, & chiefly for ambushes, being faire weather ouer head. And also in the plaine fields two or three ranckes of them being placed almost close to the frunt of a squadron of piques, and likewise vpon the flanckes and backe of the same squadron, are of good effect to giue their volees at a squadron, or diuers squadrons of Launces charging the piques; and that they must performe altogether vpon their right knees frō vnder the piques, which must garde them against the charge of the Launces. But they must take heede that they doo not giue their volee at the horsemen till they come within eight, tenne, or twelue 
                  〈◊〉
                and not eight, tenne, or twelue scores, as our such men of warre do fondly talke and teach; and in that sort they may worke verie good effect, if their peeces bee charged as they ought to be. If two squadrons of Piquers also should come to ioyne and charge the one the other, certeine nūbers of Harquebuziers being reduced into sleeues. wings, and troupes, vpon the flanckes and corners of a squadron, are of good effect, giuing their volees not too farre off, so long as there are no horsemen in the field to breake them.
            Harquebuziers also being reduced into wings, and little squares and troupes in the field, aduanced and retired with some societies, or Cameradas of loose shot are of good effect for skirmishes against the like weapons, and against Mosquettiers, so that they be backed with Piques, Halbards, or Battleaxes, and that in that

kind of action, they doo not discharge their peeces aboue thirtie, fortie, or fiftie yards, or three score at the most, and that with great order and discretion. And these are the chiefe effects of that kind of weapon.
            Now, as for Mosquettiers with their long ranforced and heauie peeces of great munition and bullet, they doo worke verie good effect in the like places and seasons, sauing that they are not to be imployed as loose shot in skirmishes: howbeit, the verie proper and apt places for Mosquettiers in the field, is to be reduced into sleeues, wings, broad squares or troupes, to flancke a 
                  〈…〉
                of armed men, or to defend a straight.The most apt and proper places for Mosquettiers to worke good effect. For those kind of soldiers hauing their Mosquets long, ranforced, and of great munition and bullet, clapping their peeces vppon their forkes, may shoote with some certaintie from of those rests, to the annoyance and mischiefe of well armed men, be they on horseback or on foote: howbeit, for the skirmish they worke little effect, by reason that the soldiers being in continuall motions, and troubled with heauie peeces of great length, as also with their forkes hanging vppon their fingers, cannot vse their Mosquets with so much readines and dexteritie, as the Harquebuziers their Harquebuzes; being a great deale more light and short, and without forkes. And to vse their peeces without restes (as some of our such men of warre doo permit them, when they come newe to the field lustie and strong) is contrarie to the vse of that weapon, because they performe no effect against the Enemie, by reason they are not able (how strong soeuer they bee) to beare their Mosquets with their left armes at anie point and blancke, being in continuall

motions; besides that, it is the next way to make them lame in their armes, shoulders, and backes. Two ranckes of Mosquettiers also beeing reduced before the frunt of a squadron of piques, kneeling vppon their knees, and encouered with piques, and vsing their Mosquets as skilfull soldiers should doo, maie worke the like effect, or better against a squadron of Launces charging, than three ranckes of Harquebuziers can doo. But they must take heed that they giue not their volee of shot at the Launces anie greater distance off, than fifteene or twentie yards, because they may shoote the more certeinlie, and not faile to light either vpon the horses or men. And now hauing declared the chiefe effects of both those sorts of weapons, I will proceed to the imperfections and common accidents of them both, as also of the better sort of such soldiers as do handle and vse those weapons, of what Nation soeuer they be.
            All Harquebuziers in skirmishes, or great encounters, or being reduced into anie forme, doo commonlie discharge their peeces without taking anie certeine sight at poynt and blanck, and out of their poynt and blancke they doo neither kill nor hurt, 
                  〈…〉
                If Harquebuziers also or Mosquettiers in taking their sights, doo faile but the length of a wheate corne in the heighth of their point and blancke,The imperfections and vncertainties of the Harquebuze and Mosquet. they worke no
                  ••
                effect at the marks that they shoote at, although they bee verie great; and in case they doo take their sights at iust poynt & blanke, yet by reason that their bullets are lower by 
                  〈◊〉
                boares than the heighth of their peeces, the said bullets doo naturallie mount, and flie vncertainlie and wide from

the marke or markes that they are shot at, and the further in distance the more they faile. The Harquebuze & Mosquet also being discharged but seuen or eight shootes in hast, doo growe hote, and then doo worke small effect, but daunger to the soldiers that doo occupie them.
            If the powder also with the which they are charged bee not well corned, and with sufficient quantitie of saltpeter, and kept verie drie, it furreth the peeces, and carrieth the bullets poynt and blanke but a little way, and manie times goe not off at all. The match also if it bee not of verie good substance, well wrought, and verie well twisted, and kept verie drie, whereby the cole of the same may be hard and good, it giueth no fire to the touchpowder; besides that, if the touchpowder bee not drie it taketh no fire, how good soeuer the cole of the match be. The Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers also, charging their peeces in anie actions of the field, if in mouing or trauersing their grounds, they do not looke well to the keeping vp of the mouthes of their peeces, but that by anie chaunce the ends of them doo goe anie thing downward, the bullets that are smaller by 
                  〈◊〉
                boare than the heighth of the cannons of their peeces, doo fall to the ground; wherevpon it happeneth, that manie Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers thrusting nothing after their bullets to keep them close to the powder, doo in vaine discharge the powder without the bullets. Also if harquebuziers or mosquettiers do not cōtinually keepe their peeces cleane without moysture or rust, and also take great heed that they do not ouercharge thē, they either put their peeces in hazard of breaking,

or els themselues to bee ouerthrowne with the reculing of them. Or if Harquebuziers or Mosquettiers in charging their peeces, do not charge them with conuenient and full charges, and chieflie the Harquebuziers, and that the powder bee verie good and drie, as also that they doo with their scouring stickes thrust either paper or felt, or something els betweene the powder and the bullets, or at the least after the bullets, whereby the whole charges of powder being restrained may take fire, and giue the more force to the bullets likewise restrained, they performe but smal effect; for such Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers, as charging their peeces in actions of the field, doo not vse to put anie thing betweene the powder and the bullets, nor yet after the bullets to keepe the powder and bullets firme and close together, doo discharge much of the powder whole out of the mouthes of their peeces vnfired, vnlesse the powder bee merueilous drie and good; for bullets for the field being smaller and lower (as is aforesaid) than the heighths of the peeces by 
                  〈…〉
                bore, the first powder within the Cannons next vnto the touch hole taking fire, doth driue out the bullets, with the powder next vnto the bullets vnfired, because that both the powder and bullets doo lie loose vnrestrained, by meanes whereof the bullets doo neither worke that effect in their distances of point and blancke, that otherwise they would doo, nor yet in the force of their blowes. Besides all which defaults & defects, neither the Harquebuze nor the Mosquet in wet weather in the field doo worke anie effect. All which so manie imperfections of Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers (as are before declared, with manie others

that I omit) are the causes that vpon manie great skirmishes and encounters that haue been verie hot, and continued manie houres, with newe supplies on euerie side, it hath often happened, that in discharging on both sides manie thousands of bullets within three, foure, or fiue scores, and neerer, there hath not been on both sides slaine and hurt with bullets thirtie men,Verie few hurt in skirmishes with Harquebuze shot in the field. which greatlie argueth the insufficiēcie of those kinds of weapons for battailes and great encounters. So as it is to bee noted, that such of our men of warre as doo giue so singular commendations and praises to the effects of Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers, as also to those weapons, and doo not knowe all their imperfections and failings before declared, with manie more, doo shewe that they haue had verie little experience of those weapons in the field, nor yet that they themselues doo knowe how to handle and vse them, and therefore doo talke like nouices they wot not what.Another great insufficiencie of Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers in the field. Moreouer, concerning the insufficiencie of those weapons of fire, it is farther to bee noted, that if there be anie number of horsemen either Launces or Stradiotts in the field, where Mosquettiers or Harquebuziers are in action, and that they haue no horsemen on their side to answere them, that it doth then behoue the shot with al celeritie to reduce themselues vnder the gard of their squadrons of piques, or if the number of them bee so great that the squadrons of piques cannot encouer them, the ouerplus must retire themselues to some such grounds of aduantages, as the horsemen may not be able to come to charge thē: for in case they should abide in the plaine field, not encouered with piques, nor garded with anie ground

of aduauntage,Mosquettiers and Harquebuziers not able to abide the charge of Launces nor Stradiotts. a thousand braue Launces or Stradiotts, were able to breake three thousand of the best Mosquettiers, or Harquebuziers of anie Nation. And now to the perfections and imperfections of our auncient weapon the Long Bowe, comparing the different effectes and aduauntages of that weapon, with the aforenamed weapons of fire.
            
               The imperfections of the Long Bowe.The imperfections of the Long bowe, doo consist onlie in the breaking of the Bowe or bowstring, for the which in times past (when there was great accompt made of Archerie) there was speciall care had, that all Liueray, or warre Bowes being of the wood of Yewgh, were longer than now they vse them, and so verie well backed and nocked, that they seldome or neuer brake: Besides that, the Archers did vse to temper with fire a conuenient quantitie of waxe, rosen, and fine tallowe together, in such sort that rubbing their Bowes with a verie little thereof laid vpon a wollen cloath, it did conserue them in all perfection against all weather of heate, frost, and wet; and the strings beeing made of verie good hempe, with a kinde of waterglewe to resist wet and moysture; and the same strings beeing by the Archers themselues with fine threed well whipt, did also verie seldome breake; but if anie such strings in time of seruice did happen to breake, the soldiers Archers had alwaies in readines a couple of strings more readie whipt, and fitted to their Bowes, to clappe on in an instant. And this I haue heard of diuers Yeomen, that haue serued as soldiers Archers in the field.
            
               And now hauing before in this discourse declared all the greatest and most perfect effects of Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers for seruices in the field, and but a part of the imperfections of them, and their weapons of fire; because there are many more, which for breuities sake I haue omitted, and that I haue last of all declared that the imperfections of the Bowe do consist onelie in the breaking of the Bowe and bowstring; because that Archers, if they bee well chosen, and sound of limbes, their weapons doo not permit anie such accidentall imperfections and failings in them, as the forenamed weapons of fire doo in the soldiers that doo handle and vse them; which hath alreadie appeared, and shall after in this discourse bee made more manifest. I will now therefore proceed to the consideration and examining of three most important things,Archers doo farre exceede and excell all Mosquettiers and Harquebuziers in three most principall effects. in the which al effects of Mosquettiers, Harquebuziers and Archers, and their weapons do consist; and that is, whether Mosquettiers or Harquebuziers with their weapons of fire, or Archers with their Bowes and sheafes of arrowes, vpon all occasions in the field, bee most readie with all dexteritie and celeritie to execute the effects of their weapons, by discharging and giuing volees at their Enemies. The second is, whether the Archers with their weapons, or the other soldiers with their weapons of fire, doo faile least to shoote, discharge, and giue their volees. And the third is, whether by reason and common experience the bullets of weapons of fire in the field, or the arrowes of Archers doo annoye the Enemies most, bee they horsemen or footmen.
            
               To the first I think, that there is no man of any experience in the aforenamed weapons, that will denie, but that Archers are able to discharge foure or fiue arrowes apeece, before the Harquebuziers shall bee readie to discharge one bullet; I meane the Harquebuziers beginning to charge when the Archers doo begin to take their arrowes to shoote. The reason is this, because good Harquebuziers are first to charge their peeces with powder by one of three waies: the first (which is best) is out of the mouthes and charges of their flaskes: the second is by certeine charges filled with powder, which Harquebuziers doo weare, or carrie diuers waies: and the third is by cartages, with the which they doo charge their peeces both with powder and bullet all at one time, and yet by which of all these waies soeuer, or anie other they do charge them, they must (if they bee good Harquebuziers) vse with their scouring sticks to thrust a quantitie of paper or felt, or something els both before, but chieflie after their bullets, to keepe them close to the powder; to the intent that their bullets vpon no accidents may fall out, or at least lie loose vnrestrained from the powder, as also that their peeces may carrie the further poynt and blancke, and their bullets giue the greater blowes; which done, they must presentlie put touchpowder into their pans, and their matches into their cocks or serpentines; al which to performe requireth a good time. Whereas the Archers in the field continuallie hauing their Bowes bent, haue no more to doo but to drawe their arrowes out of their cases and sheafes, to nocke them in their Bowes, to drawe them to the heads and shoote; all which is performed

almost in an instant. Now to the second; Archers haue no accidents nor impediments to hinder them from the performance and execution of their dischargings and volees, whereby they should anie waies faile to discharge the same, vnles their Bowes or bowstrings should breake: whereas Harquebuziers haue not onlie the same let, in case their peeces by ouercharging, or ouerheating, or crackes, or rifts, doo breake, but also if that through the negligence of the Harquebuziers, the powder with the which they charge their peeces, by anie accident haue receiued anie wet, or moysture, or that through the lacke of the closenes of their flaskes, the ayre of some moyst weather hath penetrated and entered into the flaskes, and caused the powder to giue and danke, by meanes whereof the Harquebuziers giuing fire with their matches 
                  〈◊〉
                serpentines to the touchpowder, oftentimes their peeces doo not discharge, or sometimes lieth sissing in the touchhole or peece, vntill the Harquebuziers haue lost their poynt and blanke, and then peraduenture in vaine doo goe off. The touchpowder in the touch-boxes also, if either by the negligence of the Harquebuziers (as aforesaid) or by the fault of the touch-boxes, through the moystnes of the weather, the powder hath giuen, and become dancke, then oftentimes the powder will take no fire; whereby the Harquebuziers doo not onlie faile of their dischargeings, but also become vnprofitable, till they haue dried or chaunged the same. Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers also in powring touchpowder into their pannes, the winde (if it bee great) will blowe and disperse the same, in such sort, that they shall verie often faile to

discharge their peeces; and so likewise if Harquebuziers in putting their matches into their serpentines do faile to set them of a conuenient length, that therby they may strike iust in the powder and pannes, but that they doo set the same too long, whereby the matches, if they be anie thing too lythe, do hang downeward, and with the comming downe and stroke of the cockes they fall double and short of the pannes and powder; or if the same matches by anie accident haue receiued outwardlie anie wett or moisture, then the coales doo burne inward, leauing a beard outward, so as thereby although the endes thereof doo light in the middest of the pannes and powder, yet the same doo giue no fire to the towchpowder. By all which aforesaid meanes and accidentes, with diuers others both Mosquettiers and Harquebuziers, do faile to discharge their peeces: of all which imperfections and other accidentes, Archers with their Bowes are voyde. So as by all reason and experience, it is most manifest that Archers are foure tymes more readie to giue their volees of arrowes, than Harquebuziers, or Mosquettiers their volees of bulletts. Besides all which vnreadynesses, and failings before mentioned, if in the tyme of anie battle, great encountre, or skirmish, the weather doth happen to raine, haile, or snow, the aforenamed weapons of fire can worke no effect, because the same doth not onelie wett the powder in their pannes and touch holes, but also doth wet the match, put out, or at least dampe the fire, and doth marre the powder in their flaskes and towchboxes; vnlesse the souldiours haue very good prouision, and besides;

be wonderfull carefull with their saltenbergs or mandillions to encouer and preserue the same. Whereas contrariwise, neither haile, raine, nor snowe, can let or hinder the Archers from shooting, and working great effects with their arrowes. All which argueth & proueth a singular aduantage and excellencie of Archers and their weapons, aboue al Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers with their weapons of fire. Now, peraduenture some not skilled in the perfections and imperfections of Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers, will say that they haue seene the soldiers of those weapons of fire, charge and discharge with a great deale more celeritie than I haue before mentioned; whereunto I answer, that although it be verie commendable for all Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers to knowe how to charge and discharge apace, with all other particularities belonging to weapons of fire, yet such Harquebuziers or Mosquettiers as do vse to charge & discharge so fast, are the worst of all others. For by often experience, such soldiers for hast do cōmonly charge their peeces with vncertaine charges of powder, & do neither vse with their scouring sticks to thrust paper nor anie thing els betwixt their powder & bullets, nor yet after their bullets to restraine & keepe close the same, whereby their dischargings against the enemie might be the more effectuall: besides that, in their dischargeings, they take no kind of sight at poinct & blank, nor yet at the ends of their peeces, but doo discharge at a venture; wherby it commeth to passe, that such quick and hastie Harquebuziers, doo worke no other effect but spend powder, match & shot, and heate their peeces oftentimes to their owne mischiefes; and therefore (in troth) are more meete to scarre Crowes in a

corne field (vnles they reforme themselues) than with anie weapons of fire to be employed against the Enemie.
            And now to the third, and last; which is, whether by reason and commō experience, the bullets of weapons of fire in the field, or the arrowes of Archers doo annoye the Enemies most, be they horsemen or footmen. I thinke it superfluous againe to reiterate, and set downe the different aduauntages and chiefe effects of Harquebuziers, Mosquettiers, and Archers; because I haue alreadie made them so manifest, as also that the Reader hereafter shall see in manie parts of this discourse diuers reasons, & manie notable examples and experiences, that Archers in the field doo farre exceed and excell all Mosquettiers and Harquebuziers in terrifying, wounding, and killing both horses and men. And therefore wil onlie in this place answere one obiection, which I haue diuers times heard alleaged in commendation of the effects of weapons of fire, and the dishabling of the effects of Archers, and that is; there are manie that haue reported that the blowes of the bullets of Mosquets and Harquebuziers, are no lesse than death to such as they light vpon; whereas contrariwise the blowes of arrowes doo but onelie gall, or lightlie wound: which in troth is greatlie mistaken by all such as doo hold that opinion. For that by common experience it hath been seene in all skirmishes and great encounters, that for euerie one that hath been slaine dead in the field by the shot of Mosquer or Harquebuze, there haue been foure that haue not died by the hurts of such weapōs of fire, although some of them haue remained euer after maimed, and

some not. Whereas by true experience, Archers with their arrowes doo not onlie greatlie wound, but also sometimes kill both horses and men, in such sort as they neuer depart out of the field aliue, as it shall hereafter appeare by diuers auncient as also moderne examples. Besides that, I, and diuers other Gentlemen of our Nation yet liuing, that were in France in King Edward the sixts time, and also diuers times since, haue manie times heard French Captaines and Gentlemen, attribute al the former victories of the English against themselues & their ancestors the French, more to the effect of our Archers, than to anie extraordinarie valiancie of our Nation; and therewithall further report and say, that they did thinke that the English Archers did vse to poyson their arrowe heads;A wrong opinion conceiued by the French Captaines and Gentlemen of our English Archers. because that of great numbers of the French Nation that many times had been wounded or hurt with arrowes, verie fewe had escaped with their liues; by reason that their wounds did so impostume, that they could not be cured. In which their cōceipts they did greatlie erre; because in troth those impostumations proceeded of nothing els but of the verie rust of the arrowe heads that remained ranckling within their wounds; and therefore by the common experience of our auncient Enemies, (that we haue so often vanquished) not onlie the great, but also the small wounds of our arrowes haue been alwaies found to bee more daungerous and hard to be cured, than the fire of anie shot vnpoysoned.
            Besides all which, it is to bee noted, that horses in the field being wounded, or but lightlie hurt with arrowes, they through the great paine that vppon euerie motion they doo feele in their flesh, vaines,

and sinewes by the shaking of the Arrowes with their barbed heads hanging in them, do presentlie fall a yerking, flinging and leaping as if they were mad, in such sort, as be it in squardron, or in troupe they do disorder one an other, and neuer leaue vntill they haue throwne, and cast their masters. Whereas contrariwise, horses that are in their vitall partes hurt with bulletts, or that the bones of their legges, shoulders, or backs be broken, they do presently fall down, or otherwise, although they be strikē cleane through, or that the bulletts do still remaine in them, they after the first shrinck at the entring of the bullett doo passe their Carrire, as though they had verie litle or no hurt: And this of the hurting of horses with bulletts, both I my selfe, and all others do know, that haue seene any actions performed in the field. And the other of the great disordering of horses with the hurts of our English arrowes I haue read in diuers histories, and also heard reported by diuers Gentlemen of our nation that haue seene the same. But now because I haue diuers times heard manie vaine obiections obiected by some of our Captaines of the Low Countries against Archers, to the disgracing, and dishabling of them, and their weapons in comparison of Mosquettiers and Harquebuziers and their weapons of fire: I will (with the helpe of almightie God) answere as manie of them as shall fall into my memorie; and therefore will begin with one of their litle fancies that they doo alledge against the Longbow, and so proceed to their greater, and greatest obiections.
            Among manie other their fancies they do alledge, that the Archers bowes, being by them vsed against

the Enemie in the heate of sommer,An obiection against Bowes contrary to all experience. will grow so weake, that thereby they will leese their force and effects. Whereunto I answere, that this obiection is a new fancie, and a verie dreame contrary to all ancient and moderne experience of English Archers, whose Bowes being made of that excellēt wood of Yewgh, doo neuer so decay in strength, neither by hotte nor wett weather, nor yet by often shooting in them, but that they will with arrowes wound, and sometymes kill both men & horses a greater distance off, then the shott and bullets of Harquebuziers and Caliuer
                  〈…〉
                employed and vsed in the open fields, by skilfull Conductours and Leaders; by reason of the wonderfull failings and vncertainties of those and all other weapons of fire maniable: diuers of the particularities wherof: I haue before in this dicourse made manifest.
            Also they do further alledge,Another vaine obiection contrarie to all experience and vse militarie. that vpon an inuasion of foraine dominions beyond the seas, the weapons, and furniture of Archers, as of Bowes, sheafes of arrowes and bowstrings, can not be found and prouided where Archerie is not vsed; whereas contrariwise, all kinds of munition belonging to the weapons of fire, are easie to be found and prouided in all foraine dominions. Which is as much, as if they should say, that if an Armie of fiue and twentie, or thirtie thousand of our English nation vnder some sufficient Generall were sent to inuade France, and disembarking in Normandie, and winning Newhauen and Roan, should straight march to Paris: (which is no more thā diuers Kings of England and their Generalls haue done) where after some encountres and skirmishes the Armie comming to lack powder and shott, they

should with facilitie for money prouide the same in the hart of the Enemies Countrie, where all the Townes in which that prouision is to bee had are fortified, which is a verie mockerie and dreame to bee thought on. But some of our such men of warre peraduenture will further alledge, that they might haue the same prouision by the way of conuoy, either from Newhauen or Roan, in case they were possessed of those Townes: whereunto it is to bee answered, that first the conuoy had need to bee verie strong; besides that, there is no man of anie consideration and iudgement, but that doth verie well knowe, that Mosquets, Harquebuzes, powder, match and lead, are as heauie, and a great deale more heauie to bee carried, than Bowes, sheafes of arrowes and bowstrings are. Besides that, by such their ignorant obiections, they doo euidentlie shew that they haue not read, nor heard, or els for lacke of reason not beleeued, the proceedings of the notable Kings of England in their inuasions of France, and other Dominions; for if they had, they would not then doubt, but that a King of England, or his Lieutenant generall inuading forraine dominions, would vpon such an enterprise carrie all sorts of munition, belonging to Archers, to serue them for many battailes and great encounters, as well as King Edward the third, and Henrie the fift, and their Lieutenants generall did, whose Armies did sometimes consist of nine, or ten thousand al Archers, and not aboue foure or fiue thousand armed men on horsebacke and on foote; which Princes, and their Lieutenants did neuer omit (according to their milicia) to carrie great plentie of sheafes of Arrowes, Bowes, and all other

things requisite aswell for their Archers, as for their armed men,By this obiection they discouer that they neuer sawe any Armie royall march in the field. and all other effects. Besides that, by that their simple and fond obiection, they do discouer that they haue very seldome or neuer seene an Armie royall march in the field; for if they had, they then would verie well know, that there is no puissant Armie formed either to inuade or defend, that doth consist of a well ordered milicia, that doth not in the publique carriages of the Camp, ordinarylie carrie all kindes of munitions of weapons and armours offensiue and defensiue, with all other munitions and necessaries requisite for all purposes, for the publique employments and vse of Camp, Towne, and field.
            Now, whereas some of our aforesaid men of warre do further alledge, rather vpon fancie than vpon anie souldiourlyke reasons and experience, manie vaine and friuolous obiections, partlie against the Bowes (as aforesaid) but chieflie against the Archers that do vse them,An obiection that they obiect against Archers. how good soeuer they be, saying that Archers when they haue lyen some long tyme in Camp in the field, will become so decayd in strength either by sicknes, or otherwise, that they will not be able to draw their Bowes, and worke that effect that Archers should do; whereas contrarywise, Mosquettiers and Harquebuziers will giue as great blowes with their bulletts out of their peeces being decayd in strength by long lying in Camp, or sickenes, as if they were whole. Thereunto I answere, that true it is, that the small loue that such men of warre as they are, haue borne to their souldiours in the Low Countries, allowing them nothing but prouand, and lodging them in Churches, vpon the bare stones and pauements, aswell

in winter as in sommer, with manie other their abuses and disorders, contrarie to all discipline militarie, haue made most of their souldiours vnfit and vnable to vse any sort of weapons, as soldiers should do in the field: howbeit in fauour of Archers, to conuince their simple and ignorant opinions,Harquebuziers decayd in strēgth, or hauing cricks, or aches, not able to vse their Harquebuzes. I say, that if Harquebuziers happen to be decayd in strength by sicknes, or that by long lying in Camp in the field, they shall happē to haue anie ache, or aches in their necks, shoulders, armes, backs, thighs, leggs, or feet, although that they be otherwise hart whole enough, shalbe as litle, or rather lesse able in seruices in the field to performe the effect of Harquebuziers, than Archers the effect of Archers; for Harquebuziers in such seruices must be lythe in all their ioints and sinewes, that they may stoupe to their peeces, & trauerse their grounds, now retiring hauing discharged, giuing place to their fellowes, and then aduancing againe, giuing their fellowes retiring tyme againe to charge, with such agilitie, and dexteritie, that they may be readie vpon euery opportunitie, to stoupe, and take euery litle aduantage of hillocks, bancks, vines, trenches, shrubbes, or anie such like; besides that, they must haue their armes and shoulders verie sound to carrie their peeces firme in their dischargings at the Enemie, as also to vse their scouring sticks, and charge againe; which effects they are no wayes able to performe if they be grown weak by lying in the field, or if they haue achs, or cricks in anie part of their limbes, as aforesaid.
            Mosquettiers also, it doth behoue to be strong and puissant of body without sicknes, achs, or other impediments, and euerie way sound of wind and limbe: for

if they be decayd in strength of body by lying in the field,Mosquettiers must be sound of body, or els they are not able to vse their Mosquets. or that they haue anie impediments of cricks, or aches in their necks, shoulders, armes, backs, thighs, or leggs, it is not possible that they should be able to vse their Mosquets in the field to the annoyance of their Enemies, their peeces being so wonderfull heauie, and they troubled with the carrying and vse of their rests, and loden with their other ordinarie and heauie furniture, if they be anie wayes decayd, as aforesaid, and therefore are become vnprofitable for seruices in the field: whereas Archers that are not troubled with so heauie weapons and furniture as the Mosquettiers, nor bound by the effects of their weapons to any such nimblenes,Archers although with some aches are able to worke the effect of Archers. stoupings and agilities, as Harquebuziers are, may very well draw their Bowes, if they be sound without aches frō the girdle vpward, what aches soeuer they haue from that part downward, so long as they are able to march as fast as armed men Piquers, because that according to the ancient and true vse of that weapon, they are to be vsed rather for battles and great encountres, than for light skirmishes.
            Armed men also Piquers and Halbarders,Armed men must be sound and strōg, and without aches will bee verie vnable to march in the field armed, & with their weapons, if they bee decaied in strength of bodie by long lying in the Campe, or by sicknes, or that they haue any aches, or cricks in their limmes, besides that, vpon such diseases they will be a great deale lesse able to encounter with their enemies in the field vpon anie occasion of battaile or great encounter, and to vse their piques and other weapons, as armed men should doo in such actions. All which rightlie considered, their vnconsiderate speaches, and enablings of Mosquettiers.

& Harquebuziers, and disabling of Archers vpon the accidents and occasions aforesaid, doth argue their insufficiencies in matters militarie; because such as pretend to bee men of warre, or old soldiers, should not speake rashlie,Old soldiers should speake with consideratiō, & iudgement. and (as the Frenchman saith) a la volee, but with consideration, reason and iudgement; for otherwise, how long soeuer they haue serued in warres, it may bee rightlie deemed that they haue spent their times, & employed themselues more to some other base and vile occupations, than to the consideration & exercises of matters Militarie. Moreouer, they obiect against Archers,An obiection against Archers answered. that men in this age are not so mightie and strong of bodie, as they haue been in former ages, and therefore cannot shoote so strong, and work so good effects with their arrowes, as their forefathers haue done in times past; which is as friuolous an obiection as all the rest: and the reason is this, that they may see by experience, (if they list) throughout England, as also amongst other Nations, as manie sonnes, as tall or taller than their fathers, or bigger and stronger, as they shall see lower, slenderer, and weaker. Now, peraduenture with more troth some may say, that the subiects of England within these thirtie or fortie yeares, haue not had so much exercise in Archerie, as their forefathers in times past were wont to haue, whereby it commeth to passe, that Archers in number are greatlie decaied, which I confesse to bee verie true: howbeit, that hath chieflie proceeded through the great fault and negligence of sorts of Magistrates, who hauing excellent statute and penall lawes established in other kings times for the increase and maintenance of Archerie, and that boyes from

their young yeares should bee taught the exercise and vse of the Bowe, that being come to mans state, they might bee the better able to serue their Prince and Countrie with that kinde of weapon, haue so neglected, or rather contemned the due performance & execution of those lawes, that a great deale more through their owne fault, than through the fault of the people, it is now come to passe, that the Realme hath so fewe good Archers: which their negligence, or contempt, whether it hath proceeded of that they haue been carried into the fancies of liking the aforesaid weapons of fire, because they fill mens eares and eyes with such terrible fire, smoake and noyse, or els that they haue been perswaded thereunto by some old newfangled men of warre, that do neither vnderstand the true effects of Mosquetterie, Harquebuzerie, nor Archerie, I wot not. But this I knowe, that if that weapon hereafter shall come to be forgotten and extinguished, through the negligence and lacke of good execution of such good lawes, that whereas in times past we were wont to giue battaile, and fight with our Enemies with a weapon so terrible vnto them, that they neuer had anie vse or skill of, but onelie to their mischiefe, and therefore of great aduauntage for vs, and wherein our people and Nation of a singular gift of God, & as it were by a naturall inclination with good execution of lawes, came to be so perfect & excellent, without anie publique cost & charges either to King or Realme, we shall then vpon anie occasion of warre offensiue or defensiue, bee driuen to fight with them with their owne weapons, to our great disaduantage, that is, with the Harquebuze and Mosquet, in the

which they had and haue continual practise and exercise,A great disaduantage for the English against forrain Nations. by reason that they are in the continent, where euerie kingdome and state doth ioyne one to another without anie partition of sea, and therefore driuen to keepe continuall garrisons and exercises of warre, whereas wee contrariwise liuing in long peace without anie such exercises Militarie, vpon the occasion of a warre (as aforesaid) must leauie and enroll new soldiers, and goe about to traine and exercise them with those weapons that they neuer handled before, when wee should goe to fight and giue battaile to the Enemies Armie, that is, of old soldiers of long time trained and exercised in those weapons.
            
               The excellencie of the Lōg Bowe for battailes & great encounters.Now, these weapons the Long Bowes (which our such men of warre haue so much condemned) being in the hands of such soldiers Archers as can well vse them, are weapons of singular aduantage and effect for battailes and great encounters, both against horsemen and footmen, and chieflie being so euill armed, as all Nations in these our daies both on horsebacke and on foot are, because that the Bowe is a weapon wonderfull readie in all seasons, both of faire & foule weather (which Mosquets and Harquebuzes are not) and doth wound, gall and kill both horses and men, if the arrowes doo light vpon anie disarmed parts of them; besides that, the Archers being good, they doo direct their arrowes in the shooting of them out of their Bowes with a great deale more certaintie, being within eight, nine, tenne, or eleuen scores, than anie Harquebuziers or Mosquettiers (how good soeuer they bee) can doo in a much neerer distance, by reason that Mosquettiers & Harquebuziers failing in their points

and blancke, doo neither kill nor hurt (vnlesse it happen as the blind man shooting at the Crowe;) besides that, in their points and blancke, through the imperfections before declared, they doo verie seldome hit, whereas contrariwise the arrowes doo not onelie wound,Differences speciallie to be noted. and sometimes kill in their points and blank, but also in their discents & fall; for if in their discents they light not vpon the Enemies faces, yet in their lower discents they light either vpon their breasts, bellies, codpeeces, thighes, knees or legges, and in their lowest discent, and fall euen to the verie nailing of their feete to the ground, which with the terrible comming of the arrowes in the eyes and sight both of horsemen & footmen, causeth in thē a wonderful feare & terror. Whereas contrarywise, Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers with their weapons of fire do no wayes terrifie neither horses, nor men that are but foure, or fiue tymes vsed to their crackes, smoke and noyse, vnlesse by great chaunce they happen to be striken with bullets; and the reason is this, that the bullets being discharged are inuisible,Both horses and men that are vsed to harquebuze and mosquet shot, are not afraide thereof. and therefore doo no wayes terrifie the sight; whereof it commeth to passe that when horses and men that haue been in three or foure skirmishes do see that they receiue no hurt neither by the fire, smoke, nor noise, nor that in manie thousands of Harquebuze and Mosquet shot, there are not twentie men slaine nor hurt, they grow after to be farre lesse in doubt of those weapons of fire, thā of Piques, Halbards,The vollees & sight of arrowes flying in the ayre, doo wonderfullie terrifie. Launces & swords: Howbeit the volees of Archers arrowes flying together in the ayre as thick as haile do not onely terrifie and amaze in most terrible sort the eares, eyes and harts both of horses and

men with the noyse and sight of their comming, but they also in their discents doo not leaue in a whole squadron of horsemen, nor footemen (although they be in motion) somuch as one man nor horse, vnstrikē and wounded with diuers arrowes, if the number of the Archers be answerable to the number of the squadron. And therfore for the experience that both I and manie others, both Noblemen, Gentlemen and great Captaines of many nations, that I haue serued amongst, haue had of the small effect of weapons of fire in the field, with the reasons and differences before alledged; for my part I will neuer doubt to aduenture my life, or many liues (if I had them) amongst eight thousand Archers complet,The opiniō of the author of the great effectes and aduantages of Archers. well chosen and appointed, and there withall prouided & furnished with great store of sheafes of arrowes, as also with a good ouerplus of Bowes and Bowstrings, against twentie thousand of the best Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers, that are in Christendome. For this I know (as it is before declared) that Harquebuziers, if they be led by skilfull Conductours, are not to giue anie volees of shot aboue three, or foure scores 
                  〈…〉
               , nor Mosquettiers any volees of bullets aboue eight, ten or twelue scores, at anie squadrōs of horsemen or footmen in motion; and yet that too farre, vnlesse their leaders doo thinck rather to terrifie their Enemies with smoke and noyse, than with anie hurt of the bullets. Whereas Archers reduced into their conuenient formes, being in so great numbers (as aforesaid) doo dimme the light of the sunne, darken the ayre and couer the earth with their volees of arrowes, eight, nine, ten and eleuen scores distant from them; in such sort,

as no numbers of Mosquettiers, Harquebuziers, or Argolettiers, nor yet squadrons of Launces nor of footemen,Horsemē and footemen ill armed in these dayes. being so ill armed as in these dayes they are, shalbe found able to abide the incredible terrour of the shot of such infinite numbers of arrowes. For there is no doubt but that Archers with their volees of arrowes, will wound, kill, or hurt aboue an hundred men and horses, for euerie one that shalbe slaine or hurt, by the volees of so great numbers of Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers, as are before mentioned.
            Now, whereas our such men of warre do further dishable our Archers, saying, that they are to worke in a maner no effect neither against horsemen nor footemen, and that Archers are not able in the field to abide the terrour of the shot of Mosquettiers nor Harquebuziers, with manie other vaine and fond obiections, contrarie to all reason and experience: certenlie, it is not to be thought strange in them, considering that as their ouerweening and presumption hath extended to shew their lacke of skill in manie other matters militarie before mentioned, that they pretended to haue most knowledge of, as namely in the mistaking of the conueniencie of diuers sortes of weapōs in their due times and places, with manie other verie important matters before mentioned; so in these matters of our Archerie, it is not to be meruailed at, that they do so groselie erre in their fond opinions conceiued and alledged, against the excellent effects of that weapon, of the which they neuer had any experience, nor yet doo know how to order them; as it did verie euidentlie appeare to all men of iudgement, that saw their disorderlie placing of Archers in the battles they

formed at Tilbury this last sommer.A great mistaking in placing of Archers, shewed at Tilburie. 1588. where the Earle of Leycester, being Lieutenant generall of the Armie assembled for the defence of the Realme, commaunded all such men of warre as were the chief Officers of the Army vnder him, to consider of some excellent order and formes of battle, that should be presented within three or foure dayes after, in the presence and sight of the Queene, her Councel, and Nobilitie: at which tyme some of the chief Officers of the Camp, that of long tyme had serued in the Low Coū
               tries, being there assembled to forme three battles, a Vaward, Battle and Rereward, with wings, sleeues, squares & troupes, according to their best skill, & that warning had bin giuen them of the Queenes cōming so long before; and therfore had consulted how to reduce them into most strong and beautifull forme that they could, to haue giuen battle if the Enemie had bin there; they with many terrible othes and cursings and bannings of Archers and their Bowes, partlie for the hatred they bare to that weapon, but chiefly (as I think and as it after appeared) because they knew not where to place them; in the end (after long and much a doo) they placed certen ranckes of Archers in the middest of their squadrons of Piques, behind the Ensignes, & seuen rancks of Archers they placed behind vpon the verie backe of the battle, and all the rest they reduced into sleeues, close by the flanks of their three battailes, of which sleeues some of them were of fiue in a rancke, and some three in a rancke; and because they should bee surelie garded with shot, they reduced sleeues, or rather squadrons of Caliuer shot close to the flanckes of the Archers, of which sleeues of Caliuer

shot, some were of nine and twentie in a rancke, other of fifteene in a rancke, and the smallest sleeues of eleuen in a rancke, which to all men of anie iudgement in matters Militarie, might bee a wonderfull scorne and mockerie. For in case that they should in that forme haue marched against the Enemie to haue giuen battaile, they themselues, by their fond and vnskilfull placing of the Archers, had taken away the whole effect of the volees of their arrowes. For it is to bee vnderstood, that when anie squadrons of Piquers doo approach, with intent to giue battaile and ioyne with other squadrōs of Piquers, or to receiue a charge of horsemen, they all vpright their piques, and doo close themselues by frunt and flanckes; then the Archers are to giue their volees of arrowes at the Enemie, approaching within eight, nine, tenne, or eleuen scores; and to performe the same, they ought not to haue anie other weapon placed before them, that may anie waies take away their sights to direct their arrowes towards the Enemies faces; but as they were placed, their sights had not onlie been taken away vppon such an action with the smoake of the shot, and with so manie ranckes and Ensignes closed in frunt and flanckes as were before them, but also the most of their volees of arrowes should haue flien through the taffaties of the Ensignes, and haue glaunced or lighted vpon the piques, either cleauing them, or beating them downe: besides that, (to the Archers great disaduātage) they should haue lost a great part of their ground, in giuing their volees of arrowes at their Enemies, by reason of the distance, so manie ranckes of other weapons being before them: which most grosse

and ignorant errors by them committed in their reducing of Archers, contrarie to all science Militarie, with manie other their disorders (which I omit) doo manifestly shew their lack of skill & insufficiēcie, any waies to controll or find fault with that most excellēt & renowmed weapō. Now therfore, I will proceede to the ancient and orderlie forming & vse of Archers that hath been vsed of great antiquitie by the notable Kings & great Captaines of our English nation, who with the grace of God and merueilous effect of that most singular weapō, haue atchieued so manie and so wōderfull victories against both Pagans & Christiās.
            
               The auncient order of forming Archers in the field.The ancient order of reducing Archers into forme by our most skilfull and warlike ancestours, was into hearses, that is, broad in frunt, and narrow in flanck, as for example, if there were fiue and twenty, thirtie, fiue and thirtie, or more or fewer Archers in frunt, the flancks did consist but of seuen or eight rancks at the most: and the reason was this, that if they had placed anie more ranckes than seuen or eight, the hinder ranckes of Archers should haue lost a great deale of ground in the volees of their arrowes at their Enemies, considering the conuenient and proportionate distances betwixt rancke and rancke, and ranckes before them, as also that the sight of the hinder ranckes should haue bene taken away by so manie former ranckes from directing their volees of arrowes towardes their Enemies faces. And whereas the small skil of our such mē of warre at Tilbury did (as it were) locke vp all the Archers, depriuing them of all vse and effect of their arrowes, our auncestours had so great experience of the wonderfull effect of that weapon,

that they placed their hearses of Archers either before the frunt of their armed footmen, or ells in wings vpō the corners of their battailes, and sometymes both in frunt & wings. And in this sort, they placed them in the face of the mē at armes of France, & all other braue horsmen of foraine Natiōs, who in those dayes were far better armed thā any Natiōs in these our daies are. And yet with this good order, the wonderfull effect of our Archerie and arrowes was such, that flying in the ayre as thick as snowe with a terrible noyse, much like a tempestuous wind preceding a tempest, they did leaue no disarmed place of horse or man vnstriken and wounded, as may well appeare by manie battailes and victories;Froissart, and the Frenche Chronicles. and namelie by the battaile of Crecy, that kind Edward the third and Prince Edward his sonne wonne against king Phillip of France, where the said king Phillip had eight or ten thousand men at armes, and fifteen thousand Genoüeses Crossebowers (which were no wayes inferiour for seruices in the field to the Mosquettiers of this tyme) with so puissant an Armie also on horseback and on foote, verie well armed and appointed of diuers Nations, that they were six at the least, for euerie one of the English, in which battaile were slaine eleuen Princes, and twelue hundred Knightes, besides thirtie thousand soldiers of all Nations.The notable effect of Archers at the battaile of Crecy. And the wonderfull effect and terrour of the shot of arrowes was that day such, as neither the Frēch king with his men at armes, nor yet anie other of his great Captaines with their braue and well armed bandes of horsemen of diuers Nations, were able to enter and breake the Archers although they had no piques, stakes, banckes, nor trenches to gard thē, but

being in the plaine and open fields, the Archers with their volees of arrowes did breake both horsmen and footmen, wounding or killing both horses and men; in such sort, that the French King himselfe being in great perrill,The French Kings horse slaine vnder him with arrowes. had his horse with the shot of arrowes slaine vnder him. By which example, and diuers others that I will hereafter alledge, it may be apparāt to anie man that is possessed with the grace of God, and therefore of sound iudgement, that Archers being in great numbers, and reduced into the forme of hearses, or double hearses, as wings to a battaile, or squadron of piques (that they may the more conuenientlie giue their volees of arrowes) need not to bee garded with piques, nor yet stakes (as some talke of the battaile of Agincourt) but they themselues are most braue Piquers; for as a squadron of Piquers well formed doo with their piques in their hands worke great effect in resisting a charge of Launces, or by encountring with another squadron of Piquers their Enemies: so the arrowes of braue Archers reduced into hearses, being deliuered out of their Bowes, doo become so terrible piques in the eyes and sight of the horses, as also in lighting vppon their shafrons, cranets, or steele pectorells; or being not barbed, vpon their bare faces and euerie disarmed part, that the horses with the huzzing, striking, and vnaccustomed noise, & with the blowes and wounding of the arrowes doo flie backe and athwart the one the other, in such sort, as no force of spurres can make them to goe anie further against the Archers, but that they doo disorder and ouerthrowe one another. Besides that, against squadrons of armed footmen, the volees of arrowes flying in the ayre, and

comming in their eyes and sights as thick as haile, and lighting vppon their faces, and euerie other disarmed part, doo so amaze them, that they come to loose their ranckes & disorder themselues, before they can come to ioyne with another squadron of armed men their Enemies: and also with their terror doo wonderfully confuse and confound the greatest and brauest Captaines in their directions and commandements. As it may verie well appeare not onelie by the battaile of Crecy before mentioned, but also by the battaile of Poictiers, where certeine yeares after the same Prince Edward, that was at the battaile of Crecy with King Edward his father, hauing not in his whole Armie aboue eight thousand English and Gascoignes, (of the which there were sixe thousand Archers, and two thousand armed men) ouerthrewe King Iohn of France that valiant Prince, who at that battaile was accompanied with a great part of the Nobilitie of France, and of other Nations, as Dukes, Princes, Earles, & other great Captaines, and had in his Armie aboue threescore thousand horsemen and footmen, of the which there were aboue ten thousand men at armes, and of horsemen of all sorts aboue thirtie thousand; where a little before the battaile,Froissart, and the Chronicles of France. the Prince with his notable Captaines considering the small number that he had to make head and resist the French King with so huge an hoast, did take a ground of some strength and aduantage for the gard of the flanckes and backe of his small Armie, and placing a great part of his Archers in frunt, in the open place where the French horsmen and footmen were to enter and giue battle, the Archers with their wōderful volees of arrowes (through

the great goodnes of God) did that day so wound,The wonderfull effect of arrowes at the battaile of Poictiers. kil, and mischiefe both horses & men, that he ouerthrew King Iohn of France with his whole Armie, & tooke him and one of his sonnes prisoners; and of Earles, Barons, Knights and Esquiers, to the number of sixteene hundred or more; besides that, there were slaine the Duke of Athens, with so manie Earles, Barons, Knights and Esquiers, that they were numbred to bee aboue seauen hundred, and so manie prisoners of all sorts taken by the English and Gascoignes, that they farre exceeded the number of the Princes Armie.
            
               The battaile of Nauarretta.The battaile also of Nauarretta in Spaine fought by the same Prince Edward in fauour of Don Pedro el cruel, against Don Henry of Castil, may testifie the wonderfull effect of Archers, where there were aboue a hundred thousand Spaniardes, Frenchmen, Portugueses, Genoüeses Crossebowers & Mores, both horsemē and footmen ouerthrowne in that battaile.
            
               The Frenche Chronicles.The famous victorie and battaile of Agincourt, also of later yeares fought by king Henry the fift against the whole power of France, doth euidentlie shewe the most excellent effectes & execution of Archers, where with the grace of God and incredible volees of arrowes, the Frēch kings army was ouerthrown,The notable effect of Archers at the battaile of Agincourt. which consisted of aboue fortie thousand horsemen & footmen, of the which there were ten thousand men at armes, all Knightes, Esquiers and Gentlemen; whereas king Henries Army did cōsist but of ten thousand Archers, fifteen hundred Launces, & two thousand footmen of other weapons. In which battaile were slaine the Dukes of Lorain, of Brabant, of Alinçon and Bar, with a great number of Earles, Barons, Knightes and

Esquires; besides that, there were taken prisoners, the Dukes of Orleans & Bourbon, with many other Earles, Barons and Knightes.
            The battaile of Herrings also (so called by the Frēch Chronicles) fought in king Henry the sixts time neare vnto a village in France called Rouuray,
               The meruailous effect of Archers at the battaile of Herringes. not far frō 
               Orleans, doth euidently shew the great excellencie of Archerie against all other sorts of weapōs; in which battel Syr Iohn Fastolf, with other braue English Captains by the grace of God and terrible shot of the Archers, ouerthrewe the bastard of Orleans, the Lord high Cō
               stable of Scotland, the Count of Clermount, with manie other Captaines of great accoumpt and their whole Armie of Frenchmen & Scots, in the which there were a great number of French Harquebuziers and Crossebowers, which against the Archers wrought no effect.
            I might also alledge for the excellencie of Archers the most wonderfull victorie wonne by king Richard the first in the holy land, manie yeares before anie of these battailes before mentioned; where, being Generall of the Christian Armie, by the grace of God, and wonderfull effect of his English Archers, he in a most famous battaile ouerthrewe that braue Saladin, Souldan of Egipt, with his notable milicia of Mamelucks (by many called Sarasins) and all the rest of his Armie, which did consist of an innumerable number of horsemen & footmen Turks & Arabians. But for breuities sake, I will omit the particularities of that most famous battaile, and of many other great victories that I could alledge for proofe of the incredible effectes of our English Archers in battailes: And will now come to answere

certein other friuolous obiections of smaller moment than these that I haue alreadie by such notable examples and experiences of great battailes and victories answered.
            Some of our such men of warre (because by common and moderne experience, no number of Mosquettiers nor Harquebuziers in the plaine fields, without succours of some other weapon or ground of aduantage, are able to abide the charge of halfe so manie Launces or Stradiots in number as they are, without being ouerthrowne and broken) doo therfore thinke and commonlie report,Another obiection and opinion against Archers answered. that with a verie small number of horsemen they will breake a farre greater number of Archers: by which their opinions and reports, it seemeth that as they are vtterlie ignorant, and without anie experience of the effects of Archers, so are they as ignorant of all notable histories, or els according to the newe fashion, that they doo beleeue nothing but that which they thēselues haue seen, which in troth appeareth to be verie little.
            For answere whereunto (according to the testimonie of the French Chronicles) I say, that in King Henrie the sixts time, Iohn Lord of Bellay, being accompanied with two hundred Launces at the least, and taking his way to a towne called Mans, met by chaunce with an English Captaine, called Berry, that had to the number of fourescore Archers, who perceiuing the French men,A wonderfull effect of a few Archers. presentlie reduced his men into a hearse, turning their backes to a hedge, because the Launces might not charge them in back, but onlie in frunt, and so giuing their volees of arrowes at the French Launces charging, did so wound and kill their horses, that

they ouerthrewe them, and slewe and tooke diuers of them prisoners.
            And within a while after a French Captaine of the countrie of Main, called Guion du Coing, departed from a towne called Sable, accompanied with sixe score Launces to seeke his aduenture,The French Chronicles. where he might finde anie English men in the fields, who happened to meet with an English Knight called Sir William 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                betwixt Mans and Alinçon, that had in his companie sixteene or twentie Archers on horsebacke, who perceiuing so manie French Launces, alighted on foote, and reducing themselues into forme in a broad high way, where the Launces could not charge them but in frunt,A merueilous effect wrought by a small nū
                  ber of Archers. they put their horses from them, and the French Launces charging them, the volees of arrowes of those fewe Archers wrought such notable effect against the French horsmen, that they brake and ouerthrew them, in such sort, that there were diuers of the French slaine and taken prisoners.
            And in our tyme king Henry the eight being at the siege of Teroüenne and a conuoy of munitions and victuals being at that tyme to go from Guiens towardes Teroüenne,
               
                  Martin du Bellay.
                all the French Captaines of Picardy and Vermandois hauing intelligence thereof, did assemble all their men at armes & Launces of those prouinces, with some number of shot also both Harquebuziers and Crossebowers, and attended the English conuoy in ambush more than a league beyond the towne of Ard, towardes Teroüenne, where encountring with the English light horsemē 
               auant courirs, they did ouerthrowe them, which being perceiued by the English Captaines of the conuoy, they presently reduced their

carriages into a conuenient forme, and placing conuenient numbers of Archers in the two open places of the carriages before and behind, and forcing all other places betwixt carriages and carriages with Archers, where the French Launces might haue anie entrance; after a long fight and many charges by the men at armes of France and their shot giuen, the terrible effect of the volees of arrowes was such, that a great number of their horses were wounded or slaine,A notable effect of Archers and one of their chief Captaines, called Monsieur de Plessis lifting vp his sword to strike, was with an arrowe shot in at the arme hole through his gusset of maile, and there slaine, with many other men at armes, & French Gentlemen of good accompt: In such sort, that the French, which did farre exceed the English in number, were that day repulsed and ouerthrowne by the excellencie of Archers. And at this action there is an old English Gentleman yet aliue, whose name is Master Caudwell that was there present. And these examples aforesaid, are sufficient (I thinke) to conuince and confound the vaine opinions and obiections before mentioned.
            Now, if the effect of volees of arrowes bee so terrible both against horsemen and footmen armed (as I haue before declared by so many reasons & examples) what then are the volees of arrowes able to performe against Mosquettiers and Harquebuziers, that are in a manner altogether disarmed, whose weapons of fire in the field, doo rather terrifie and make afraid yonglings and nouices of warre, with smoake and noyse, than with anie often killing, hurting, or wounding them with bullets, whereof not onlie old soldiers, but

horses also that are a little vsed to their fire, crackes and smoake, are not anie thing amazed nor afraid; but three or foure volees of arrowes lighting amongst anie number of Mosquettiers or Harquebuziers (how old and braue soldiers soeuer they bee) will so amaze and terrifie them, that they shall faile to charge their peeces, to put touch powder into their pannes, & their matches into their serpentines. Besides that, they will either wound, kill, or mischiefe them, in such sort as happie those that with three or foure arrowes in their bodies, faces, armes or legges, throwing downe their Harquebuzes and Mosquets, can escape out of the terror and daunger of the volees of arrowes. For confirmation wherof, there be diuers moderne examples, with verie honorable testimonie of such as are yet liuing, verie honorable by birth and parentage, as also by titles of honor and worthines, of the which that noble Gentleman Ambrose Earle of Warwicke is one,
                  Ambrose Earle of Warwicks experience of Archers, penned with his owne hand. that accompanied the Duke of Northumberland his father (then Earle of Warwicke) a man of great valour and sufficiencie for the gouerning and conducting of an Armie, who in the yeare 1548. was sent by King Edward the sixt, as his Lieutenant generall with an Armie of horsemen and footmen, to suppresse the rebellion of Ket in Norffolke, who at that time lay encamped with a great power of notorious and hardie rebells by the Citie of Norwich, vppon a high hill called Mount Surrey, to the which Citie the Duke with his Armie being come, he with great order did encampe and lodge himselfe and his Armie on the other side of the citie and riuer, & the next day he entred the towne and brought in foure and twentie field peeces, to the

chiefe charge whereof he appointed the Coronell Courpenick an Alman and a great soldier, with his regimēt of Almans, which was twelue hundred, the most of them braue shot, and all old soldiers, with diuers other English bands and valiant Captaines of our owne nation for the gard of the same; but before they could throughlie entrench themselues, those furious Rebels contrarie to all expectation, descended downe their hil with such a furie of shot of arrowes, being al Bowmen, Swords and Bills, that they gaue such a terror and feare to our people both strangers and English, as they were faine to runne away with the losse of the Ordinance, and slaughter of a great sort of soldiers, and before the Duke could make head against them, they had recouered eighteen field peeces, and carried them vp to their hill euen with verie force of men. And within two or three daies after, those gallants did not let to abide the battaile against the Duke & his whole Armie in the plaine field, where the battaile was so manfullie fought on both sides, that it could be hardlie iudged by the best soldiers that were there, which side was like to preuaile, but in the end, God giuing the victorie, it was seene by that battaile that arrowes were a most noble weapon. And whereas the Duke at his first assembling and forming of his Armie, had chaunged many Archers into Harquebuziers (because he had no opinion of the Long Bowe) he after that victorie and suppression of the Rebels, vpon the experience that he in those actions had of the daunger and terror of arrowes, (his owne horse being wounded vnder him at that battaile with three or foure arrowes, whereof he died) did both then & many times

after openlie protest his error before Count Malatesta Baglion, an ancient and a noble soldier Italian, and other great Captaines Italians and Almans, saying, that from that time forward he would hold the Bowe to be the onelie weapon of the world, and so did all the notable Captaines both English and strangers affirme the same. And this I haue set downe almost verbatim, from the report of the aforesaid Ambrose Earle of Warwicke that now is, who was present at that action, and had his horse also wounded vnder him with two or three arrowes.
            In the same yeare of the raigne of King Edward the sixt also, & in the same sommer, Sir Iohn Russel knight, Lord priuie seale, that was after Earle of Bedford, being sent by the King as his Lieutenant generall with a great power both of horsemen and footmen, against the Rebells of the West parts, accompanied with the Lord Grey of Wilton, Sir William Herbert, (after Earle of Penbrooke) the Lord of Hunsdon that now is, with manie others both Knights & Esquiers of great worship, and comming to certeine skirmishes & encounters with the Rebells, the Archers of the Rebells did so behaue themselues with their volees of arrowes against diuers old bands Harquebuziers Italians and Spaniards, that they draue thē from all their strengths, as from bancks, ditches, hedges, and other aduantages of ground, to the great mischiefe of manie of those strangers. And of these great effects of Archers against Harquebuziers,The Lord of Hunsdons experience of Archers. I haue heard the Lord 
                  〈…〉
                aforesaid (who was there an eye witnes) verie notably report. Besides that, manie yeares past I haue heard Captaine Spinola an Italian (who was a verie braue

soldier,Captaine Spinolas opinion and experience of Archers. and wounded with arrowes in those seruices and actions, giue singular commendation of the Archerie of England.
            
            To the like effect and singular commendation of Archers, I haue also heard the aforesaid Earle of Warwicke diuers times further report,This was also penned by Ambrose Earle of Warwicke himselfe. that in the yeare 1562. he being at Newhauen in Normandie Lieutenant generall for the Queene that now is, the notable and great Captaine Chastillon Admirall of France (being then at the siege of Caen in Normandie, and at that time fauoured by the Queene of England) did send to the Earle for a succour of some English bands, of the which he desired that the most might bee Archers. But the Earle at that time hauing no Archers on that side the sea, sent vnto him a supplie of sixe hundred braue Harquebuziers, with some armed men also, which he very thankfully receiued, but therewithall signified vnto the Earle that he had rather haue had two hundred Archers,The Admirall Chastillons opinion of Archers. and that he would haue performed greater seruice with that small nūber of Bowes, than with all those braue Harquebuziers. And this message was sent from that great Captaine to the Earle by Sir Francis Somserset, Sir Nicholas Throgmorton, and Sir William Pelham.
            
            And shortlie after, that notable Coronel Alman the Reingraue (who had serued manie yeares in France) accompanied with manie other braue Captaines both French and Almans, with a great power both of horsmen and footmen, comming downe and encamping not farre from Newhauen, there happened a great skirmish betwixt certeine English bands of Newhauen, and the French and Alman companies, which continued

verie hot, with many volees of Harquebuze shot, and newe supplies on euerie side, but at the length the French and Almans exceeding the English farre in multitude, forced them to retire with disorder euen to the verie gates of Newhauen; during which action, it happened that fourescore tall Archers (Hamshire men) did at that time land in the Hauen, who taking their Bowes and sheafes of arrowes, with their other furniture, did presently march without any tarriance through the towne into the field where the skirmish was; vpon whose comming, the English bands that a little before were forced by the often charges and great multitude of the shot of their Enemies, to retire euen to the verie town-ditches and gates, taking courage a fresh, they and the Bowmen entered againe into skirmish with the Almans and French, where the fourescore Archers did behaue themselues so notably against the enemies with their volees of arrowes, that with the braue and valiant charges which they and the rest of the English bands gaue vppon their enemies, but chieflie with the excellencie of the Archers, they forced them not onelie to retire, but to turne their backes: in such sort, as putting a great number of them to the sword, they became masters of the field. Vpon which notable effect of those fewe Archers, as also vpon diuers others that the Reingraue had before time seene in seruing against the English, he shortlie after vppon the returne of a message that had been sent vnto him by the Earle of Warwicke (Sir Edward Horsey being the messenger) did most highly commend the notable effects, that he long before in diuers seruices had seene performed by the English

Archers against both horsemen and footmen: & said also, that long before that time he knewe by experience, that great numbers of English Archers were able to performe verie great matters in the field; but that so small a number of Bowmen as were in that last great conflict, should bee able with their arrowes to do so great mischiefe against his old bands of Almans, French and Gascoignes,
               The Reingraues opiniō of Archers. he would not haue beleeued, if he himselfe had not seene it. And therefore did with great reason and experience protest and acknowledge, the Long-bowes of England to bee the most excellent weapons for the field that were vsed by anie Nation in Christendome, and said that the Queene of England had great cause so to esteeme and accompt of them. And to this effect I haue diuers times heard the Earle of Warwicke himselfe verie notablie report.
            
               Sir Iames Crofts experience of Archers.I haue also heard Sir Iames Croft, that honorable and most sufficient Gentleman, that hath serued diuers of our Princes in manie great and principall offices and charges Militarie, both in England, France, Scotland and Ireland, declare verie notable effects, which he himselfe hath seene by our Archers in diuers actions performed. The particularities whereof, as also his opinion concerning the excellencie of that weapon, I remit to his owne report.
            Now, notwithstanding all these notable experiences and examples of the excellent effects of Archers against Harquebuziers; our such men of warre haue vsed to alledge, that neither the Harquebuzes were so good, nor yet the Harquebuziers so skilfull in those daies, as now their Caliuerers are: whereunto

it may be answered with great reason and experience of diuers auncient Captaines both Italians and Spaniards,
               Harquebuziers were as maniable and of as good forme fiftie or threescore yeares past, as now they are. that I haue knowne (of the which some are yet liuing) that not onlie the Harquebuzes which the Italians & Spaniards did vse fiftie or three score yeres past were as maniable, and of as good forme as now they are, but also that the Harquebuziers were as skilfull and perfect with that kind of weapon, as they are now in these our daies.Harquebuziers Italians and Spaniards were as skilfull fiftie or threescore yeares past, as now they are. And that hath manifestlie appeared by the infinite numbers of great skirmishes that haue bin verie effectuallie performed with Harquebuze shot in the Emperour Charles, & the French Kings warres in Italie, France, the Lowe Countries, and Burgundie, as also in Barbarie against the Turkes and Mores, and in the warres of Germanie, betwixt the said Emperour and the Duke of Saxonie, & other Reystates and Princes of Germanie. Which opinions aforesaid misconceiued, and verie ignorantlie alledged by our such men of warre, to the disabling of the Harquebuziers of other Nations in times past, and enhabling their Caliuerers of this time, thereby to detract the excellent effects of our Long-bowes, doth further manifest their lacke of sufficiencie to iudge of the exercises and vse of those weapons of fire, not onlie of times past, but also of this present time, and that hath appeared in diuers of their seruices of the Lowe Countries, as I haue heard certeine of our old Captaines of good experience affirme, that haue seen some of their vnskilfull seruices in those parts; and was also confirmed by the fained skirmish that some of their Captaines, Officers, and old bands of Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers of the Low Countries

of their owne training, did the last sommer most disorderlie performe before my Lord Treasurer at Tilburie, where they discharged one in anothers necke, and hauing discharged their peeces, did run out of their troupes and stand still, and charge their peeces againe, and returning to giue newe volees, did discharge their peeces at their fellowes hammes, legges and backes, running together thicke and threefold so disorderlie, that it was a scorne to behold them: and this in the opinion of many Gentlemen, & some old Captaines of good seruice and experience that were there present and beheld the same, who concluded the insufficiencie of our such men of warre of the Lowe Countries, by the lack of skill, imperfections, and insufficiencies of their trained souldiers, according to the old prouerbe; In discipulis magister videtur, like masters like men. Which aforesaid action at Tilburie, doth not onlie make manifest that our such old soldiers Harquebuziers are now as vnskilfull, as the newe Soldiers Vison̄os Spaniards of two moneths pay were manie yeares past, but if that anie forraine enemie with such vnskilfull Harquebuziers as they were, should assaile a quarter of the like number of our Archers, they should not be able to abide two volees of arrowes, without casting away their peeces and turning their backes.
            And now hauing in this my discourse made manifest the excellencie of our Long-bowes and Archers, by many reasons & examples, ancient and moderne, both against well horsed and armed Launces, as also Harquebuziers, which I thinke by all reason may suffice to conuince and confound all the ignorant

opinions and friuolous obiections of our such men of warre, as also to induce all such as are of any right consideration and iudgement, to acknowledge the sufficiencie & excellencie of that weapon; & that it is further euident by all forren Histories that haue made any mention of the differences of Bowes, vsed by many Nations, as also by such as haue trauailed in many parts of Europe,
               Our English Archers and Bowes are the most excellent of all other Nations. 
               Affricke, or Asia, that our English Bowes, arrowes and Archers do exceed and excell al other Bowes vsed by all forren Nations not only in substance & strength, but also in the length & bignes of the arrowes: I will now further shewe the wonderfull effects that hath bene wrought by diuers sorts of forren Bowes, as Gothian, Parthian, Arabian, Turkish, and Tartarian, all which (as aforesaid) are inferiour vnto ours: that by such notable effects by thē performed, all such as are of sound iudgement, not caried with toyes, fancies and new fashions, may very well knowe, that God hath giuen such exceeding and excellent effects vnto that weapon, that of all others it hath euer bene, and yet may be iustly accounted the chiefe weapon of battells and conquests.
            I thinke it is most manifest by all Histories, that haue written of puissant and conquering Nations, that in many and diuers ages vnder their great and notable Captaines, haue giuen themselues to enlarge their dominions, or with force to possesse the habitations of other forren people, that they haue erected some kinde of milicia and discipline militarie, to atchieue and performe the same. And as the best kinds of weapons in the handes of well disciplinated, obedient and exercised souldiers, is a principall part of a

               milicia,
               Al conquering Nations haue vsed the Bowe as their chiefe weapon. to atchieue victories; so I thinke it is most euident, that all those conquering Nations haue made chiefe choise of the Bowe, as of the most excellent kind of weapon for victories and conquests.
            And although they haue not vsed in their armies that weapon alone, but other weapons also incorporated with them, yet it is most manifest, that the greatest number of such mightie armies haue consisted more of Archers either on horsebacke or on foote, than of any other sorts of weapons, and by their excellent effects chiefly, haue beene atchieued most notable and wonderfull victories; as for example: Were not diuers Emperors and great Captains Romains with puissant armies many times inuading the Parthians and Persians,
               All great conquests, next vnto God, atchieued chiefly with the force of Arrowes. sometimes ouerthrowne, and many times repulsed by them, and that chieflie by their Archers? Were not Crassus and Cassius with a mighty armie which did consist of many legions of olde soldiers Romaines, ouerthrowne and vanquished in the plaine fields with the force of the Parthian arrowes? And was not Valerian the Emperour ouerthrowne and taken prisoner, in a great battaile by the Persians, and that chiefly by the great effect of their arrowes? Besides all which it is most euident by diuers Histories, that neither the notable Consulls of the ancient Romanes, nor yet after them the Emperors Romans with their conquering milicia were euer able to conquere the Parthians and Persians, defending themselues chiefly with that excellent weapon of Archerie on horsebacke.
            But now to speake of foure mightie and conquering Nations, that of later yeares, but in diuers ages,

haue vanquished and subdued diuers great partes of the world. It doth appeare by many Histories, that the Gothes, Vandalls, Alans, and other septentrionall Nations, vnder their notable Princes, & great Captains, making warre at diuers times vpon the Emperour Romanes,The Gothes, Vandalles, and other Septentrionall Natiōs did atchiue all their victories chieflie with their Bowes. and inuading Greece, did besiege the imperiall citie of Constantinople, and did spoile the Panonias, now called Hungarie, and Austria, with Illyria, Dalmatia, and many other prouinces. Also they inuaded and wasted Italie, sacked the most auncient and famous citie of Rome, with a great number of other Cities. And in diuers notable battailes wounded and killed many great Captaines, and some Emperours & their Generals with their arrowes. After which they passed through & spoiled Frāce, inuaded and conquered Spaine, and caried their armies to the straights of Hercules, now called Gibraltar. Also the same Vandalls and Alans passed the straights, and inuaded Affrike, and conquered in a maner all the Leuant sea coasts of the same now called Barbarie. And it is most euident, that they did performe & atchieue al those their battailes, victories and conquests, more with the effect of their Archers and Bowes, than with all the rest of their weapons.
            And not many yeres after that,The Arabians with great nū
                  bers of archers on horsebacke did atchieue wonderfull victories and conquests. the Arabians (a nation before that time litle spoken of) vnder their false Prophet Mahomet, & his successors Halifas, with infinit numbers of Arabian Bowmen on horseback, & some numbers of Zagaias (which are double headed Lances) did inuade the dominions of the Empire of Constantinople. And with those weapons chiefly did conquere al Mesopotamia, Suria, Armenia, and Persia.
               
Also, they did win Ierusalem and many other Cities and Prouinces, and brought the Emperour Heraclius and some other of his successours to be tributaries vnto them. And in diuers great battailes with their arrowes did wound and take some Emperours and many of their Generals, prisoners.
            Also, they inuaded Affrike, conquered Egypt, and subdued all Barbarie euen to the very Ocean sea. And shortly after passing ouer the straights of Gibraltar into Spaine, and finding the Gothes & Vandalls possessours of the same, through the exacting and tyrannicall gouernement of their two last kings Gothes, Vitissa and Don Rodrigo, brought from all their ancient exercises militarie and vse of their Bowes, they did conquere the kingdome euen to the very mountains Perinëos, and atchieued many other notable victories and conquests in Italie, Greece, Sicilie, Candia, and other Islands of the Archipelago, and all those chieflie, by the wonderfull effectes of their Arabian Bowes.
            
               The Arabians forgetting their Art militarie, and vse of their Bowes were conquered by the Turkes.After all which notable conquests atchieued by the Arabiās vnder their Halifas, & that they through long peace and some ciuil dissention, were now growen into ambition, enuie and couetousnes, and to neglect their ancient discipline militarie and vse of their Bowes, the Turkes (a new Nation at that time in a maner vnknown) comming at the first but with fiue thousand, all Archers, from beyond the mountaines of Caucasus to the aide of Mahomet, then King of Persia, vnder their braue Captaine Tanglaropice Muçaleto, did performe great seruices vnto the Persians. And after vpon lacke of pay, and some other iniuries vnto them by the Persians offered, retiring thē
               selues

to the mountaines, they did most valiantly defend themselues, vntil that new aides and great numbers of Archers and Aljauas Turkes came to ioyne with them. At which time inuading the Persians, and ouerthrowing and killing their King in battaile, they conquered all Persia;The Turkes with great nū
                  bers of Archers did atchieue manie great victories and conquests. and after inuading Armenia did vanquish and kill the Halifa of 
                  
                     •
                  aldac, and did subdue in a maner all the Dominions that Mahomet that false prophet, and his successours Halifas had in certaine hundreds of yeeres before conquered in Asia. And all those conquests, with many battailes and victories he and his Turkes atchieued chiefly with the wonderful effects of their Bowes, of which weapon their milicia did principally consist. After whose time, the Soldans his successours, and Otoman the first Emperour of the Turkes, and his successours did win many battailes and victories against the Emperours of Constantinople, chiefly with the aduantage of that weapon.
            And it is further apparant by diuerse Histories, that the Tartars inhabiting towards the North and Northeast seas of Asia, being reduced into a discipline militarie vnder diuers of their Princes & Captaines, as Hocata Cham,
               The Tartars with innumerable numbers of Archers on horsebacke, did atchieue wonderfull victories and conquests. 
               Gabo Sabada, and Haloon, did with their innumerable numbers of Archers, and Aljauas on horsebacke, not onely subdue all the East partes of Asia, euen to the very Ocean seas, but did in diuerse ages inuade the West partes of Asia, vanquishing and ouerthrowing in many battailes diuers Soldans with their great armies of Turkes, and spoiled & made tributarie vnto them Parthia, Persia, Media, Armenia, Mesopotamia, and Suria.
            
            
               And last of all Tamberlan, that valiant Emperour of the Tartars inuading Asia minor, and comming to battaile with Bayezet, at that time Emperour of the Turkes did ouerthrow & vanquish him & his mightie armie and tooke him prisoner. Which battaile and victorie he atchieued by reason that his armie of Tartars did farre exceede the Turkes in numbers of Archers. Which most excellent effects of Archers before mentioned, was the very cause that mooued Amurat (the second of that name) Emperor of the Turkes, within fewe yeeres after to institute for the gard of his person that milicia of the Ianissaries on foote, who being Christian mens children renied, & taught from their youth the exercise of the Bowe,The institutiō of the Ianissaries on foote is all Archers. as also of later yeares of the harquebuze, doe become most excellent in both kinds of weapons; so as when the Turke doth send any numbers of them vnder his Basshas to the besieging of any Cities, or towns, they al vse to take with them both their Bowes, and their Harquebuzes; Their Harquebuzes to vse in trenches against places fortified, and their Bowes for seruices of the field. Howbeit, whensoeuer the Turke in person with an imperiall armie doth inuade any Prince or Nation, hee hath alwayes with him twelue or foureteene thousand Ianissaries on foote with their Bowes and cemitories without anie Harquebuzes, for his last and most assured refuge, and gard of his person: So as it is most euident that the Basshas, Bellarbies, and Senjaques of the Turkes (of the which there be so many notable and excellent Captaines able to gouerne, conduct and commaund great and mightie Armies, as all the West partes of Christendome

haue not so many, nor the like) who knowing all the effectes of weapons of fire, as well as the best men of warre of Christendome, do by all reason militarie preferre their Bowes before their Harquebuzes for all battailes, and great encounters in the field: And euen so likewise two other most puissaunt and mightie Empires of Asia and conquering Nations, the one of the Tartars, and the other of the Persians, Parthians, and Medians vnder the Sophie, which Empires and Nations although they haue knowen and had the vse of weapons of fire long before they were knowne in Europe,
               The inuention of artillery, powder, shot, and small peeces of fire was not first in Germanie (as some doe write and tell) but they were first inuented, in the kingdome of Cataia, and in vse in diuers partes of Asia aboue 800. yeeres past: & that I haue read, and also heard reported in Spaine by two Embassadours, the one of Venice, and the other of Portingall.
                yet haue they alwayes, and doo still greatlie preferre their Archers and Bowes on horsebacke for battailes and victories, before their weapons of fire.
            And now as I haue before in diuers parts of these discourses brieflie set downe manie notable effects of our English Archers, against both horsemen and footmen of all sorts of weapons, with such and so manie notable battailes & victories atchieued by our English nation, chieflie (next vnto God) by the excellencie of our said Archers; And that I haue last of all brieflie declared the wonderfull victories and conquests in diuers ages atchieued by foure so notable Nations, and that most of all by the notable effects of their Bowes, (I meane the Gothes, Vandals, and other such septentrionall people, their companions and fellowes in armes, as also the Arabians, the Turkes and Tartars): So I might further with the testimonie of many notable histories, & partlie by the very Bible it selfe, (if it were not to auoide prolixitie) shewe and prooue, that all the notable and famous Nations of

               Europe, Affrick and Asia, that haue since the beginning of the world,Some peraduenture will say, that the Spaniards without Long bowes, but with Cros-bowes, Harquebuze shot, & other weapons, haue cō
                  quered a great part of the west Indies: whereunto it is to be answered, that those Indians were simple people, that went naked, and had no vse of yron nor steele. euen vntill this present time, atchieued infinite victories and conquests, haue atchieued the same by the wonderfull effects of Bowes, as by the weapon of all others that God hath put into the hearts of men, to deuise and vse sometimes to defend themselues withall against foraine Nations, that haue vniustlie assailed them; & sometimes to inuade, and by battailes and victories to chasten and punish other such Nations, as in former times had had the perfect vse of the same; and yet after in processe of time, by the permission of God for their sinnes, had neglected and forgotten the vse thereof, that thereby they might receiue the punishment of God, by the well exercised hands in those weapons of other warlike Nations, that were either more in the fauour of God, or els appoynted by him as instruments, with bloud to chasten and punish such transgressors. Diuers of the which examples, because I haue in my Proeme of these discourses briefly declared, I think it would bee holden for superfluous to rehearse, and digresse into such innumerable examples of the excellencie and merueilous effects that haue been in all ages, wrought by infinite Nations with that most miraculous weapon; and therefore will reduce my selfe, and proceede to the proouing and concluding, that although skilfull Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers with their weapons of fire, be verie excellent in their conuenient and due times & places (as I haue in diuers parts of this discourse particularlie declared) yet that for battels & victories in the field, they are no waies cōparable to our English Archers and Bowes.
            
               And now againe to returne to the answering of other obiections of our such men of warre, who (notwithstanding so many reasons and examples by me before alledged in due & iust commendation of Archers) haue not been ashamed many times most phantastically to report,An opinion contrarie to all reason and common experience. that our arrowes wil not wound men through single buffe Ierkins, nor scarse through their ordinarie clothes: which ignorant and fond speaches were more seemelie to come out of the mouthes of nouices and yonglings that neuer sawe any thing, than from such as professing armes, ought to speake with consideration, reason and iudgement. And therefore it is greatlie to bee pittied, that men of so great ignorance and smal vnderstanding in affaires and actions of warre, are grown to such an ouerweening in their owne conceipts, that in their fond bablings they doo make so light of those our weapons, that the great Captaines of France, and other Nations in King Edward the thirds time, & other kings times, did by the experience of their daungers & mischiefes so greatlie redoubt, that they caused their footmen (although they were as well armed for the defence of their bodies & heads, as footmen now a daies are) to carrie pauoises of seauen foot long, and a foot and a halfe, or two foote broad, with little holes towards the vpper end armed with steele, for them to looke through; which pauoises did couer their faces, and al other disarmed parts euen downe to their toes. And that their men at armes also (because our arrowes were so terrible in the sights of their horses, and that they did wound them in the eyes and legges, and euerie bare and disarmed place, which made them run

athwart the one the other, as is before declared) did oftentimes forsake their horses, and reducing themselues into esquadron, came vpon our Archers with their launces and swords, the beuers of their helmets downe, and armed cap a pie, as it doth appeare by diuers great encounters mentioned in Froissart, and other histories.
            But because the wonderfull effects and mischiefe of arrowes, may further appeare to be farre different from the dreames and reports of our such phantasticall men of warre, I will now of many Emperours, Kings, and great Captaines that haue been wounded and killed forraine Archers and arrowes, inferiour vnto ours, alledge a fewe examples to auoide prolixitie, beginning first with some testimonie out of the Bible.
            
               Examples out of the scripture of diuers kings that haue bin wounded and slaine with arrowes.Was not Saul (the first King of the Iewes, and a valiant Prince) in his last battaile fought with the Amalakites, afraide of the volees of their arrowes, and himselfe wounded with an arrowe? And was not Ioram King of Israel slaine by Iehu his successor with the shot of an arrowe, that strake him into the bodie and through the hart? And was not Achab also king of Israel, in a battaile against the Sirians, ouerthrowne and wounded with an arrowe, that strake him into the bodie betweene the ioynts of his armour, of the which wound he that night died?Examples out of notable histories of manie Emperors, Kings, and great Captains wounded and slaine with arrowes.
            
            Besides that, it is further manifest by many other notable histories, that Alexander the great, that most mightie Conquerour, besieging the Citie of Gaza in Siria, was himselfe sore wounded through the habergin into the shoulder with an arrowe, in such sort,

that he was by that wound in great daunger, and his whole Armie thereat greatlie amazed. Vespasian also that famous and excellent Emperour, was wounded himselfe with an arrow in a great encounter and conflict, that he had against the Iewes by the citie of Iorpata in Iuda. The Emperour Decius also was ouerthrowne & slaine in a battaile against the Gothes; and Decius Caesar his sonne striken dead with the shot of arrowes. The Emperour Valens also was ouerthrowne in a great battaile by the Gothes, and himself sore wounded with an arrowe. Don Alfonso also King of Leon in Spaine, and Don Sancho King of Aragon were (although at diuers times, & in diuers places) wounded and slaine by the Arabians and Mores with arrowes. Manuel also Emperour of Constantinople, was ouerthrowne in a great battaile against the Soldan of Iconio, and himselfe wounded with arrowes, notwithstanding his armour and target, in the which he had thirtie arrowes sticking. Orcan also sonne vnto Otoman and second Emperour of the Turkes, was ouerthrowne, wounded and slaine with arrowes, in a merueilous great battaile fought betwixt him, his Turkes and the Tartars. And finallie, Mahomet the second of that name Emperour of the Turkes, that wonderfull Conquerour, that did so prosper in all battailes, and besiegings of townes, that he wan the two Empires of Constantinople, and Trepizonda, and killed the Emperour Constantine Dragon Paleolego, as also the Emperour of Trepizonda, called Colojani, and besides conquered ten Kingdomes of Christians, and slewe foure Kings, and all this chieflie by his notable milicia of Archers, yet notwithstanding

all those his great victories and conquests, in a great battaile fought betwixt him and that famous Vayuod Iuan Huniades Coruino, he was himself wounded with an arrowe, and his Turkes thereat so wonderfullie amazed, that thereupon he and they were by the Christians vanquished, and compelled with great disorder, dishonor, and losse of his people to retire to Constantinople. Which notable examples of wounding, and killing of Emperours, Kings, and great Captaines by foraine Archers, and arrowes inferiour vnto ours, may verie well shewe the ouerweening, and lacke of consideration and iudgement of our such men of warre, that haue sought by their vaine and ignorant speaches and words, to deface the force, violence, and wonderfull effects of our English Archers and arrowes, contrarie to infinite examples and notable histories in diuers languages, and experiences of manie conquering Nations, and most excellent Captaines both auncient, and also of this age.
            And now hauing in this my discourse endeuoured my selfe by manie reasons and examples, to make manifest how our such men of warre haue mistaken the vse and effects of diuers sorts of weapons out of their due times and places, with diuers other their errors Militarie, contrary to the moderne opinions and vse of diuers forraine warlike Nations, as also that I haue (according to my first proposition) particularlie set downe the most of the perfections and imperfections of Mosquettiers and Harquebuziers, & of their weapons, with the perfections and imperfections of Archers and their Bowes, with manie reasons and examples also to shewe and proue, that the auncient

effects of our Archers and arrowes, are no waies decaied nor blemished by the effects of Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers, but that they doo in the field farre exceed and excell the effects of all weapons of fire maniable, and further, that no horsemen nor footmen are able to abide the terror and daunger of the volees of our arrowes, with many examples of battailes, victories, and conquests, of great encounters and skirmishes, of wounding and killing of mightie Emperours, Kings, & great Captaines with arrowes; I now come to conclude, that our Archers, being yet so excellent as they are, although in number not so manie as they were in times past, may (being well ordered) worke as great or greater effects in the field,The conclusion of this discourse. than they did in former ages; considering that al Nations of the occidentall parts of Christendome both horsemen and footmen, do now vse to weare fewer peeces of armour to couer and defend their bodies, than they did a hundred, two hundred, or three hundred yeres past, when our Archers wrought so wonderfull effects, not onlie against the men at Armes of France, and other wel armed Nations, but also against the shot and volees of armed Crosse-bowers; who as they were verie skilfull with that weapon in those daies; so were they no waies inferiour to the shot of Mosquettiers and Harquebuziers of these our daies.
            
               
               A briefe comparison betwixt Reisters, Carabins, or Argolettiers, so much vsed in forren parts in these our dayes; & Crosse-bowers and Archers on horsebacke, which were vsed by the English, and diuers other Nations many yeares past: With mine opinion also, concerning which of those weapons are of greatest effect for seruices in the field.
               
                  DIuers of our English Captains and Gentlemen that haue serued in the 
                     〈◊〉
                   warres of the Lowe Countries, or peraduenture some time in the ciuill warres of France, do so praise and magnifie the shot of Carabins or Argolettiers (as they terme them) and of Reisters, which are Pistollettiers, that they will not admit any shot on horsebacke to be comparable vnto them, imitating therein diuers forren Nations, that in these dayes doe vse those weapons on horseback. In which their opinions I doe not meane to touch them with any blame, because I do not remember any Nation in these West parts of Christendome, that doe vse at this present anie other. Howbeit, when I come to consider of such shot on horsebacke as hath bene vsed in times past, which are the Long-Bowe and the Crosse-bowe, and that there be some principall Gentlemen and Captaines of diuerse Nations yet aliue, that haue seen them vsed in the field, as namely of our English, that graue and most experienced Gentleman sir Iames Crofte; & that I do compare the vnreadines, imperfections and small effectes of the weapons of fire aforesaid, with the readinesse, perfections and great effectes of Crosse-bowes and Long-bowes. I doo (in mine opinion) greatly prefer those two ancient weapons on horseback before the

said weapōs of fire for al seruices in the field. And because it may appeare vnto such Gentlemen as may peraduēture reade this my opinion, how, & in what sort I would haue such Archers & Crosse-bowers to be horsed, armed and weaponed, I will first make mention thereof, and after briefly proceed to the fortifieng & prouing of mine opiniō by diuers reasons.
               All the Crosse-bowers on horsebacke vnder sufficient conductours well skilled in that weapon,How Crosse-bowers on horsebacke should be horsed, armed and weaponed. I would they should haue Crossebowes of two pound and a halfe of the best sort, with crooked gaffles hanging at their strong girdles after the manner of Germanie, that they might on horsebacke bend their Crossebowes the more easily and readily, with foure and twentie quarrells in a case, well and fitly set at their saddle pommells, mounted vpon good cold geldings of meane size, themselues armed with good murrians of the Spanish fashion vpon their heades, collars, light and short wasted cuirasses and backes, with sleeues of maile or chained with maile; or else, that they should be armed with murrians, light and easie Brigandines, and sleeues chained with maile, with broad short swords by their sides of not aboue a yarde in length,How Archers on horsebacke should be horsed, armed and weaponed. and short daggers. The Archers on horsebacke vnder their Captaines or conductours skilful in Archerie, I would likewise haue mounted vpon good quiet geldings of meane size, with deepe steele skulles in very narrowe brimbd hats, well stuffed for the easines of their heades; and either iackes of maile, according to the ancient manner when they were called, Loricati Sagittarij, or else light and easie brigandines, or at the least Ilet-holed doublets verie

easie and well fitted to their bodies, their sleeues chained with maile, with broad short swordes and short daggers, their Bowes of good Yeugh, long and well nocked and backed, and all their strings well whipt, with sheafes of foure and twentie arrowes apeece, with shooting gloues and bracers after the manner of our Archers in times past. And all these both Archers and Crosse-bowers I woulde haue them to be well practised, that they might knowe how to discharge their arrowes and quarrells gallopping vpon the hand, and in all other motions of their horses, and the Crosse-bowers to bend againe with great readines. And diuers bandes beeing thus horsed, armed, weaponed and exercised, as also reduced into little bandes of fifties vnder sufficient conductours, and other Officers skilfull in those weapons, should (in mine opinion) be able to performe greater seruices in the field either against horsemen or footmen,Crosse-bowers & Archers on horsebacke of greater seruice than weapons of fire on horsebacke. than any of the forenamed weapons of fire on horsebacke, considering that both Archers and Crosse-bowers may with their arrowes and quarrells very certainly wound or kill in their points & blancks either horsmen or footmen that are in esquadron or troupe, two or three scores off; and rouing sixe, seauen, or eight scores, may greatly mischiefe and annoy the enemie: whereas the Argolettiers and Pistolettiers are not to worke any effect against esquadrons, or troupes of horsemen or footmen aboue ten or fifteene yards off at the furthest, and if it be enemie to enemie single, then they are not to discharge their peeces aboue three or foure yards off, vnlesse they will faile foure times before they hit once, so vncertaine are those

weapons of fire: the iudgement whereof, (because this mine opinion may seeme strange to such as doo not knowe the imperfections of those weapons of fire on horsebacke) I referre vnto any Captaines or Conductors of those weapons either Italians, Spaniards, or French that haue bene vsed to receiue the pay of Emperours or Kings: and if it be of the Pistolettiers, then to the Reisters themselues.Harquebuzery more vncertaine on horsebacke than on foote, with the imperfections thereof. Besides whose iudgements, by all reason it may appeare, that if the shot of Harquebuzrie on foote in their distances in the field be so vncertaine, as I haue in my former discourse declared, then of necessitie it must be a great deale more vncertaine vpon horsebacke, where, by euery motion & stirring of their horses (although they be very quiet) they shall in a manner as often hit Barnacles flying in the ayre, as hurt or kill any horses or men, vnlesse they be very thicke and wonderfull neere. Besides that, the charging of their peeces on horsebacke (be it with flaskes, cartages or charges) is so vncertaine as they shall as often spill their powder besides the mouthes of their peeces, and faile of their chargings, as charge the same. And also putting their touch-powder into the pannes of their peeces, although there be no winde to disperse the same, yet vpon euery motion of their horses, they are ready to powre the powder beside their pannes. And if their peeces be Petronells, then if their stones should happen to breake, or not to stand right in their cockes, whereby they should faile to strike iust vpon the wheeles being fire-lockes, or vpon the hammers or steeles, if they be Snap-hances, or being of match, if their matches be not good and stiffe, and well set

in their serpentines or cockes, they also shall faile in their discharging; besides the difficultie that they shall finde at one time to charge their peeces, to haue an eie to their enemies, and to gouerne their horses, vsing also their scowring sticks as they ought to do: which imperfections of weapons of fire, with manie more, in the experience of all olde and skilfull soldiors, are the cause that the shot of them doo terrifie and scare newe soldiors and nouices of warre a great deale more with crackes, smoke and noyse, than with any often hurting with the bullet. All which vnreadinesses, disaduantages and imperfections of Argolettiers, Carabins, Pistolettiers, or Reisters considered with the readinesses, aduantages and perfections of Archers and Crosse-bowers for all seruices in the field. I come to conclude, that Crosse-bowers on horsebacke vsed by many forren Nations of great antiquitie, and that Archers on horsebacke vsed by our auncestours many yeeres past, as also at this present by the Turkes, Tartars, Persians, Arabians, and other mightie Nations, do farre exceede and excell all weapons of fire on horsebacke.
            
            
               An exhortation to the Magistrates and Gentlemen of England.
               
                  THese discourses which I haue handled & set down, with many reasons aledged, as also with very notable exāples & opinions of great captaines, & testimony of most approued histories, concerning the excellencie of Archers and diuerse other weapons in their due times and places, with many

errours and abuses militarie by our such men of war practised, and in publike places perswaded and taught, I haue not taken in hand and performed with anie intention or hope to reduce them from their erroneous opinions martiall, or to perswade them to giue credit to any thing by me alleadged and proued, because they are growen to such a selfe-wil & liking of their owne opinions or rather fancies militarie, that their ouerweening, wilfulnes & presumption do extend so far, that diuers of the chiefe of thē will giue no credit to anie historie alledged, nor anie experiēce nor example that they heare by their elders reported, nor yet any thing by diuers reasons proued; but onlie vnto their owne fancies & such few things as they thēselues haue seen: which doth most euidētly argue in them a wonderfull arrogancie, and obstinat barbarousnes, & that they neither haue, nor euer will haue any vnderstāding in the science militarie. For it hath bin alwais a principle in the opinion of al great Captaines, as also in all reason & experience, that no man can attaine to any sufficiencie and excellencie in the arte and discipline militarie, but by three principall meanes, that is, by seeing actions of armes & of war performed, by conference with others to vnderstand the reasons of things in action or already done, & by the discourses of men of experience, and histories of things in times past performed & done: as for example; What doth it auaile any Nobleman or Gentleman how excellent a wit & courage soeuer he hath, incase he had seene all the chiefe and best fortifications that are in Europe, as also many encampings of armies in campes formed, dislodgings, marchings in diuers formes, with many battailes, skirmishes and

great encounters: If hee neglecting to learne and vnderstand the causes of those things which hee hath seene, hath giuen himselfe to dicing, carding, making of loue and drunkennes? Or if his pride, arrogancie & ouerweening, haue so possessed him, that he hath disdained to harken or confer with others, that haue bene able by experience to instruct and giue him the reasons of things by him seene;Many haue seene much in matters militarie, and do vnderstand but little. which in trueth are the verie causes that there are so many Captaines, & Gentlemen of diuers Nations that haue beene in many campes, and haue seene diuers armies and actions, and yet do vnderstand very little of the Art and Discipline militarie.
               Now therfore, those our men of warre being such as I haue before declared, and that notwithstanding there haue been such wonderfull opinions conceiued here at home of their sufficiencie, that they haue been not only compared with the greatest Captaines of this age, but also thought to bee the onlie men of warre of Christendome: certeinlie, it is greatly to be meruailed at how any such opinion should bee conceiued of them, considering that they neuer serued in any imperiall or royall warres of Emperors, Kings, nor formed Common wealths within the continent of Europe, Affricke, nor Asia, where they might attaine to any such knowledge in the Art Militarie, but onlie in the disordered and tumultuarie warres of the Lowe Countries vnder the States (where the soueraigne gouernment and commaundement hath consisted of a broken and vncertaine authoritie, all things tending (with great disorder and confusion) more to the spoyle, than to any discipline or Martiall seruice)

or peraduenture some verie little or nothing in the licencious and ciuil warres of France; in both which warres for the lacke of certaine and assured pay for the men of warre, as also rewards for particular and extraordinarie deserts and worthines, it hath been impossible to establish and continue any formed milicia & discipline Militarie,No discipline militarie in ciuill warres. wherby either Captaines or soldiers should grow to any skill and sufficiencie, but rather to errors and ignorances, as it may verie well appeare by the politique and Militarie discourses of that notable and braue soldier Monsieur de la Noüe, where the imperfections and insufficiencies of such as haue attained to their chiefe skill in those warres, are verie manifestlie set downe. To the particularities whereof (because his booke is not onelie extant in French, but also translated into English) I remit those that are disposed to see and consider. Besides all which, the wonderfull disorders, and lack of vnderstanding of our such men of warre, in all their proceedings and actions Militarie haue been such, so many, and so great, almost in al matters that they haue taken in hand in the Lowe Countrie warres, that not onlie in the iudgement of all the great Captaines Italians, Spaniards, Burgonnions, and other Nations, that either haue knowne their seruices, or serued against them, but also in the opinions of some of the wiser sort of the States themselues, they haue been iudged to bee men of no vnderstanding, nor sufficiencie in matters of warre, although it hath bin giuen out and reported farre otherwise to their aduantage here at home amongst vs, altogether to their merueilous and incredible commendations and praises: wherevpon

there hath been such credite giuen to their fond speaches and ignorant perswasions, by the better sort of our Nation, that they haue not onelie since our Nation began first to go ouer to serue as mercenarie soldiers in the Low Countries vnder the States, brought in great numbers of disorders and abuses Militarie, farre different, or rather cleane contrarie to the auncient and moderne experience, vse, and proceedings of all warlike Nations, but also in a great part defaced, and decaied the accompt, vse, and exercise of our most excellent weapon the Long-bowe; which in short time to come (if it be not verie speedilie prouided for by the execution of such penall statute lawes, as haue been in times past ordained and established for the exercise and maintenance of the same) will growe to bee forgotten, and in a manner vtterlie extinguished; which, if through the negligence of the better sort of our Nation, imitating and following the simple and ignorant opinions of our such vnskilfull men of warre, it should come to passe, it doth in mine opinion argue nothing more, than that God hath withdrawne his hand, and all right iudgment in matters Militarie from vs, and that in time to come, vpon any great warre either offenciue or defenciue, we shall, when it is too late, repent the same, greatlie to the hazard and perill of our Prince, Countrie and Nation. The consideration whereof, for the great loue that I haue alwaies borne, and doo still, according to my duetie,The principall causes of writing these discourses. beare to the Crowne and Realme of England and English Nation, was the first and principall cause that mooued me to take these discourses in hand, to the intent to aduise & perswade (as much

as in my power and small abilitie is) the Nobilitie, Magistrates, and better sort of our Nation, with all care and diligence to reuiue, and put in execution the auncient statutes prouided and established, for the encrease and exercise of the youth of England in Archerie, that as God of his great goodnes hath blessed our Nation with a wonderfull aptnes and dexteritie in that weapon,The English, of all other Nations the best Archers. more than any other Nation that I haue seene, heard, or read of throughout the vniuersall world: so that wee may not through the friuolous and vaine perswasions of a fewe vnskilfull and ignorant men in these our daies, as vnthankfull, neglect that great and especiall goodnes of almightie God, and singular gift that he hath endued vs withall: but that wee doo with all care and diligence beleeue, and imitate the great experience of our most worthie Auncestors, that in diuers ages, with the aduauntage of that most excellent weapon, haue atchieued such and so many wonderfull and miraculous victories against diuers Nations, both Christians and Pagans. As also that we doo giue credite to the greatest Captaines of our Nation, and diuers other Nations that haue liued in our time, some of the which being yet aliue, and of principall sort and calling, haue seene the mightie works and wonderfull effects of our English Archers, and therefore with all right iudgement, reiecting all newe fancies and toyes, that we doo embrace and esteeme that singular weapon, to bee the chiefe and principall of all others for battailes, victories and conquests.
               And now to make an end, I doo againe (as I did in the beginning of my discourse) notifie that mine intention

hath no waies extended by any thing in my discourses contained,No honorable nor worthie minded men anie wayes intended to be touched in this discourse. to touch the reputation or honor of any Noblemen, nor Gentlemen of noble or worshipfull houses, nor yet any others of worthie minds that haue entred into those Low Countrie seruices, rather to win reputation, knowledge and honor, than for any hope or desire of spoyle, or greedie gaine, but onelie such of our men of warre, as neglecting and contemning all true honor & discipline Militarie, haue brought in amongst vs a most shamefull and detestable arte and discipline of carowsing and drunkennes, turning all matters Militarie to their own profite and gaine, neglecting to loue and to win the loue of their soldiers vnder their gouernments & charges, making in a manner no accompt of them, nor of their liues; in such sort, as by their euill conduction, staruing and consuming great numbers and many thousands of our most braue English people, as also by their infinite other disorders, they haue made a farre greater warre vpon the Crowne and Realme of England and English Nation, than any waies vpon the enemies of our Countrie.
            
            
               Honor & gloria in excelsis, Deo, omnipotenti, sempiterno, & incomprehensibili. Amen.
