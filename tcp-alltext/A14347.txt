Neither is it possible that the excedynge mercye and

fauour of god towardes this royalme of Englande maie more euidently appere, then it is by these two tokens folowinge declared, the one that it hath pleased him by his moste puissaunt and mightefull arme to deliuer vs oute of the bondage of this Romishe Egipte, ferre passinge the yoke & seruitude whyche the children of Isarel suffred vnder Pharao, and the other, that of his espiciall grace he hath vouchesalued to open the yies of oure hertes that we maye see the trueth, and to giue vnto thys royalme the righte knowelege concernynge thys moste holy sacramente whiche the subtille and craftie illusyon of Sathan by the instrumente of the saide purpurate whoore of Babylon had made of a moste pure fountayne of water springinge vp into euerlastinge life, a foule stynking puddle of idolatrie and supersticyon to endelesse damnacyon: of a most precious and heauen iewel, a most vile and deyulyshe abominacyon: of a moste comfortable medycyne, a most deadly, & present poyson. Blissed therfore be the name of the lord our god for euer & euer, who of his infynite mercy & botomlesse goodnesse hath cast his most fauourable yie vpō this royalme of Englād, illumining the hertes of the same most gladly and cherefully to enbrace his ghospell, and giuing vs to ou

               e Kinge suche a Godlye Iosyas as in his tender yeares of childehoode neither forgeateth ne ceasseth with the moste feythfull aduise and trustie assistence of his moste noble & sapient Counsaylours to trauayle aswell that the woorde of God maye bee syncerely and purelye set foorthe and taughte vnto all his moste derely beloued subiectes, as also that this

sacramente of the Lordes body and bloude maye bee reduced to the right vse accordyng to the first institucion therof in the primatiue Churche. And forasmuch as the whole processe of this discourse is bothe consonaunt vnto the worde of God that it cannot be doubted of, but that it is true, and also so iustely agreynge with the kinges Maiestees moste godly procedinges that the people maye by readyng or hearyng herof be throughly satisfied and perswaded vniuersally to enbrace and folow the other. I thinke it (as I haue said) a weorke right expedient and necessary to be hadde in the Englishe toungue aswell for the instruction of suche as can reade, as also for the helpe of some good persones & curates, whiche though they haue a good zele & forwardnes to set forth ye kīges maiesties most christian procedynges: yet for defaulte of sufficiente learnyng (the more is the pietee) are not of themselues hable neither throughly to enstructe their flocke of all the trueth, nor to satisfy the ignoraunt in suche doubtfull cases or questions, as maye haplye aryse aboute this matier, nor finally to stoppe the mouthes of sedicious Papistes, or of suche as are malicious and indurate enemies againste the pure doctrine of Christes ghospell. And althoughe in treactynge of suche hygh matiers it can not bee auoided but that by reason of some schoole termes or argumentes there must nedes bee many thynges, that maye seme to passe the capacitee and vnderstanding of the vnlettred sorte: yet is not suche a notable good weorke as this discourse of Petur Martyr or as his disputacions vpon the same matier therfore to bee suppressed or kepte (as it

wer) hidden vnder the bushel. For yf no booke should bee sette foorth but suche as euery bodye yea euen of the vnlearned and grosse multitude mighte bee hable to vnderstande whan they heare it or reade it: than what should Chauncer, Goore, Lidgate and others doe abrode, whom some euen of the learned sorte doe in some places scarcely take? than were it vayne to set foorthe Chronicles or statutes in whiche is bothe a great noumbre of wordes, and also muche matier not easie to be perceyued of euery body: than wer it laboure loste to sette foorthe in Englyshe bookes of seruice and homelies vnto the grosse and rusticall multitude, whose capacite is not hable to conceiue that is in them conteined than wer it vayn to haue translated and sette foorth the bible in Englyshe to the vulgare people, and moste vain to reade it in the Churches, forasmuche as a greate noumbre of thynges whiche the symple ignoraunt people rede and heare thereout, are ferre aboue the 
                  •
               eache of theyr grosse vnderstandynge. But all suche good and godly bookes as wel of holy wryte as of other profane argumentes, are to this entente sette foorth and published, that euerye bodye maye be edifyed as ferre foorth as hys capacyte wyll serue. And lyke as wythout any reading or hearynge at all, they shoulde continue euermore blynde and ignoraunt: so by continuall readynge and hearing the vnlearned & simple maie take enstructiōs & from dai to day procede & growe in knowelage till at laste they shall by due vse and excercise, be hable to vnderstande as muche as shall bee necessarye or expediēt for thē. Now this boke I haue laboured to make as plain as I could do, & therfor in som places I haue

either altered or leaft ye scoole termes whych otherwise would haue made the thing more derke, & brought it as nere I could to the familiar phrase of English speakyng, or els haue added suche circumstaunce of other woordes, as might declare it & make it plain. Wherfore thoughe for the cause abouesaide I maie seme in some places to haue somewhat swerued from the precise woordes of the latin booke: Yet I trust it shall to the fauourable and indifferent reader appere that I haue not any thynge degressed from the autours mynde. Now as we commonly see that men where thei thinke themselues endoubted or boundē, though thei can not fully requitte or deserue the manifold benefices that thei haue receiued yet (as the nature and duetie of thankfulnesse byndeth them) thei will not be negligent

And thus I shall commende thesame my labours vnto youre lordshippes patronage and proteccion and your selfe vnto the lordes tuicion

as sone as I shal haue aduertised you of the processe that Martir foloweth in this weorke, whiche is that firste he bryngeth in the schoole Doctoures and all that euer maie bee saied for transubstantiation as strongly as is possible to bee reasoned, and as muche as can bee alleged for it. Than bringeth he in the reasons suche as he thinketh good, both out of the fyrst Scriptures, and generall Counceile, and also oute of the Doctoures to confirme his owne opinion against transubstantiacion. Thirdely he confuteth and soilleth al the argumentes and reasons of the schoolemen and Popishe writers one by one, in ordre as thei were propouned and this doth he so clearkely, so profoundly, and so pitthilye, that no man can saie more Beseching therfore youre Lordeship yf any default or lacke bee, to impute it rather to myne insufficiencie in translatinge it, then to the authoure in wrytinge it, I will no longer with hold thesame frō the hearinge of Martyr himselfe speake, who shal more delighte and edifie you then my penne maye dooe.

               ciacion into the body & bloud of Christ which semeth to be the highest & moste perfecte poynct of the Sacrament with the materiall thynges.
            
                Secondarily we shall searche and trye out another determinacion which supposeth the wyne and the breade (as touching their perfect and true natures) to be reserued and kept still in the sacramente, and so to remaine therin, that they haue annexed and ioyned vnto them the very true bodye and bloude of Christe (as they speake it in theyr termes) naturally, bodely, & really, that is to saye in very persone.
            
                Thyrdly shall be considred and weyghed the assercion of some others, whiche affirme that the premisses are by none other meane but a sacramentall waye coupled together, that is to wete, in the waye of betokening and repres

               er of ye sacramēt seme to make for the religiō of a christiā man. We shall therfore begynne at the opinion of transubstanciacion, partlye because it is of the grosser sorte, and partlye because it is but of a late tyme c

Whyle the minister thereunto deputed and ordeined, pronounceth the wordes of the Lordes institucion ouer matier and stuffe due and conueniente for the purpose, that is to wete, ouer bread & wyne, so that he haue an intenciō (as they terme it) so to do: the substaunce of breade and wyne is conuerted and chaū

               ned into. But in dede that supposiciō is for this reason a false supposicion, because that Christes body doeth not recraue any suche accidentes. Some others haue laboured to constitute and appoynte the ayer as the naturall fundamente and subiecte of the saied accidentes: which thing lykewise because it can not be proued, al those for the moste part that are maynteyners and defendours of this sentence, dooe agree that they are but as byhangers, and dooe remayne withoute a subiecte.
            Than ferther they wyll these accidentes whiche are seen, felt, & tasted, to signifie vnto vs the very true bodye of Christe, whiche they conteyne within them couered and hidden. From this they procede ferther, and affirme this body of Christ ye lyeth hyd vnder the sayed accidentes to be a signe aswell of the verye selfe

body of Christ that hāged on the crosse, as also of his body misticall, that is to saye, of the congregation and felowshyp of the electe sorte and predestinate. Wherupon the May

Neither doe they take it for thinges contrarie to reason that in this Sacrament two distincte bodyes should be conteyned in one selfe place. For they are constreined to take that for one of theyr posions and conclusions. For emiddes the accidentes of the breade there is a

Many thynges mothere might yet be here brought in cōcernyng this sentence, but thus muche I thynke to be sufficiente for our discoursyng at this time.

            Now the Argumentes that they bringe for this conuersion or transubstanciacion,
               The Argumentes for tra
                     •
                  substanciaciō. are these.
            Fyrst & formost. The holy scripture doth enforce it. For in ye sixt of Iohn ye lord promised yt he wold geue  his fl
                  •
               she not onely for the lyfe of the worlde, but also to be eaten: and added these wordes thereto:
Except a manne eate my fleashe and drinke, my bloud, he shal not haue life.
            
            He moreouer affirmed hymselfe to bee the bread from heauen, yea and the liuely breade, whiche the father hadde geuen, in which place he promised in playn wordes that he wolde geue hymselfe to be eat
                  •
               n after the lykenesse of bread: and the thyng that he promised he did truely and vprightly perfourme, as the Euangelistes do beare witnesse that it was done at his last supper. And that ye thing which is geuen to eate, is the lordes body, Paule doeth playnly shew whā he saieth:

                  Whoso eateth and drinketh it vnworthilye, shall be guiltie of the bodye and bloude of the Lorde. And agayne: He eateth and drinketh iudgemente agaynste himselfe in that he maketh not a difference of the Lordes bodye.
But all the strength and pith of this argumente they auouche to consist in these wordes, in which it is sayd: This is my body: which wordes they wil ī any wyse to be cleare & to haue no nede of any ferther exposicion or declaracion. And to vs (say they) for the reuerence yt we oughe to the word of God, it is behouable to beleue the wordes. For the Euangeliste Mathew Marke, and Luke doe with a full consent agree vpon those wordes, yea and the Apostle Paule also in his former Epistle to the Corinthians. And onlesse it were a mattier of great weyght and importaunce, and so to be taken as it souneth without any ferther or other circūstaunce, the Apostles wold neuer with so greate concorde haue agreed among themselues. That if it were a thing lawful with tropes, that is to say, with figurate maners of speakynges to defeact or auoyde it: than shal nothyng (saye they) be safe ne sure for the Heretiques but that they wyl corrupte it with counterfaicte exposicions.
            
                Secondarily such propos
                  •
               ciōs as these, This is my body, ought so to be taken, yt the former part of the clause, & the later part, doe represent & specifie one selfe thyng: and that the whole proposicion or clause be (as in the schoole terme it is called) Identica, that is

to saye, of suche sorte, that one and thesame thynge is ment and signifyed by bothe partes of it, except there be some thyng founde commyng eyther before or after in the processe of it, that muste driue vs to some trope or allegorie, whereas in this place is founde no suche thyng. Yea and in case a mā vieu rightly as he should dooe the processe that foloweth: it rather calleth vs backe to the simple and playne vnderstandynge of the wordes as they lye. For thus goeth the texte forthe: Whiche is deliuered for you. And manifest it is, that the very true and selfe body of Christe it was, that was deliuered for vs.
            Thirdly suche thynges as by nature and kynde  are distincte thynges, and (as the Logicians in theyr terme call it) disparata, that is to saye, so disseuered, that their natures disagree, and haue some contrarietie one to the other, as (for example) a manne, a horse, and a stone: al suche thynges (I say) are of suche rate yt it cannot by any meanes be truely sayd, that the one is the other. For it cannot in any manner of speakyng be truely sayed that a man is a stone, or a stone is a man. And that breade and Christes body are of this rate, that is to saye, are thynges of two distincte and contrarie natures, no man nedeth to doubte. Wherfore it shall neuer be true to saye of breade, that  it is Chistes body. And therefore whan the lorde pronoūced these wordes, This is my body, it must of necessitie be, that the substaunce of bread was gone.
            Another reason also that is made, is this: In saying This is my body, Christ did not without a due cōsideracion vse this word, is, whiche is in grāmer a

verbe substantiue, that is to saye, it playnly signifieth being, & it is of ye present tēse, yt is to say it signifieth y• tyme that is no we presente. For els he might euen aswell haue sayed: This signifyeth or betokeneth my body, or, this repr

                Furthermore if the substaūce of bread (saye they) shoulde remayne still than shoulde two soondrie substaunces yea & the same corporal substaunces of quā

                They also take an argument out of the forme, the nature and the ordre of doing sacrifice. For if the body

of Christe be offred vp by the mynister: it is necessary that he haue it there, and that he there presente it vnto the sight of God, excepte we will saye that he offereth no more but a thyng onely signifyed and betokened or a thing represented vnder a shadowe.
            After all this they roare with an open mouthe  that auncient fathers are altogether on theyr syde.the fathers are cited for transubstanciaciō.

                Thei yet ferther allege and brynge in for their purpose, that it is not put in the greke simply and onely. This is my bodye, but this article, the, is put thereto, so that it is sayed in Greke not 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               
               
alone, but thus, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , as if ye should saie in Englishe, the bodye of me. And the Grekes dooe euer cō
               monly vse to adde suche articles, whan they will properly and effectually signifie or expresse the thyng that thei speake of, whiche phrase of speakyng by articles, the Latin men haue not, but our Englishe toung, and the moste parte of other toungues haue them.
            Thei go yet ferther, and allege, that Christ made  promise vnto his Apostles, saying: I Wil be with you vntill the ende or consummacion of the worlde. Whiche wordes (saye thei) are not to bee referred to his godhead onelye, (for the Apostles theimselfes knewe that point well enough and doubted nothyng of it) but because thei wer sad and heauie for his bodily departure, therefore he comforteth thē, saying that he will bee present with them afterwarde, euen in his body too.
            Besides the premisses, in case transubstanciacion should  bee taken awaye, and breade there remayne, than forasmuche as the sayde breade cannot bee the bodye of Christe: there should bee leaft onely a significaciō: and in this case, the Sacramentes of the newe law should not haue in them anye thynge that were not to bee founde in the Sacramentes of the olde Lawe. For the olde Sacramentes did conteyne a significacion of Christe too. Yea and if a man haue respect to the outewarde lykenesse or semblaunce: the sayd olde Sacramentes wente muche more nerer to the liuelye signifying or fyguryng of Christe, then dooeth breade and wyne. For their brute beastes were kylled,

and the bloud of thesame was
                  •
               hed foorth, whereas in bread and wine there dooeth no manier suche thing happen.
            
                And forasmuche as Christe promised in Peter that the feith of the Churche should not faile, and forasmuche as the said Churche is the moste derely beloued spouse of Christe: it semeth to them a wonderous case howe he hath of so longe continuaunce leafte the Churche in this Idolatrie, and hath not in so longe whyle reueled and shewed the trueth of the matier agaynst so great an abusion.
            
                Thei argue f

               rthermore in this manier. If the substaunces of breade and wyne beeyng conserued & still remainyng, the trueth of the thynges, can not bee there present, (as it is afore concluded:) than shall there bee nothyng more found ne had in the Sacrament, thē in other common meates and repastes. For in them al so the feithfull shall well vnderstande the significacion of breade and wyne. And thus the dignitie of the Sacramentes, perishe and come to nothyng.
            
                Finally thei allege, that the worde of God ought to haue his ful strength and power inuiolably conserued & kept: whiche if it bee taken away, than doeth not transubstanciacion remaine. Ambrose in his treactise of the sacramentes,

                and Paule dooeth fiue soondrie tymes make expressemenciō of it callyng it euery where by the name of breade. First he saieth:i. Corin. x. Is not the breade whiche we breake a Communion or participacion of Christes body? And in thesame place. All we are one breade, and one body, which cōmunicate of one bread.i. Cor. xi. In another place. As oftē as ye shal eate this bread, ye shal shewe the Lordes death vntill he come. Also, whosoeuer shal eate this bread and drinke this cuppe of the Lorde vnworthilye, shall be guiltie of the bodye and bloud of the Lorde. Lastly. Leat a mā examine himselfe, and so leat him eate of that breade, and drinke of that cuppe. Forasmuche as these wordes and saiynges of Paule are clere and open: therfore if an Aungel from heauen shall preache other doctrine, accursed bee he.
            In dede I could here haue brought in, that is often

and in soondrie places of Scripture mencioned of breakyng bread:To breake breade a cō

                     •
                  ase of the Hebrues. but yet because I se that suche phrase of speakyng maye be taken in another sence, as it wer spoken of the vulgar and common foode of people, as for example, in the fiftie ninth chapitur of the prophet Esai: Breake thy bread vnto the houngry: and in the fowerth chapitur of the Lamentacions of Hieremie. Their litel babes craued breade & there was none to breake it vnto thē: therfore I leaue out all suche places, & will allege for this purpose none but strong reasons and substanciall. Forasmuche therfore as the places of Paule aboue cited are plain and euident, thei ought to bee taken accordyng to the playn woordes without any ferther gloses A sophistical obiecciō.or addicions But some make a sophisticall cauillacion that it is called by the name of breade because of the natures whiche are chaunged, and (to vse thesame phrase of speaking that suche sophisters dooe) thei affirme thesame to be a denominacion a termino a quo that is frō the point that it came fro: that is to saye, it hath the name of breade because it was once breade, and now chaunged from breade or out of breade. And for confirmacion herof thei allege other lyke places out of Scripture: As whan the Serpent that was made of Aarons rodde deuoured the Serpentes of Pharao his Magians or wisemen, whiche thei also had made of their roddes, it is sayed in the Scriptures, that Aarons rodde deuoured the Serpentes of the Magia

                  s Also man is in diuerse and many places of Scripture called yearth, because that mans body was fyrst made therof, Also the woman was called of Adam, a bone,

                     •
                   aūswere to the obiecciō afore goyng. But these and all other lyke obieccions are made in vaine. For in the holy scriptures is conteyned open and playne mencion of these conuersions, so that the necessitie of the storie and of the woordes enforceth & driueth vs to suche tropes that is to saye, to suche phrases of speakyng, and therfore we admitte and receiue them. But nowe leat these felowes likewise on their part first declare and proue out of the holy scriptures suche a conuersiō or chaūge to bee made, that is to wete of breade and wyne into the body and bloud of Christ: and than will we graūt and yelde vnto them the abouesaid tropes also, which is, that it is called breade not because it is breade still, but because it was breade afore. And to thesame effect and purpose it is, that thei ferther allege. If a mā had geuen me wyne, which wyne did immediately weaxe soure, I hauyng in my punch

Wherby thei well declare & proue the wyne newely made of Christ

               s they shall not fynde anye suche declaracion concernyng the Sacrament, that the breade is saied to be conuerted or chaunged into the body of Christe.

               The second argumente.An other argumente is. The olde fathers had the same Sacramentes that we haue, and yet emong thē there neded not any suche transubstanciacion, that either the stone, or the water that flowed oute of the stone, or ye 
               Manna shoulde suffre any transubstanciacion, whiche thyng at that could not bee dooen. Wherfore suche transubstanciation is not requisite to oure Sacramentes neither. The first proposicion and parte of this argument we reade in Paule, whiche is, that the fathers of the old lawe and we had one and the selfe same meate. But our aduersaries saie naye,Another obieccion and wil yt our Sacramentes bee vtterly and many soondrie waies distinct and differyng from the misteries of the olde fathers: Whiche thyng we also graunte vnto theim, as well for the diuersitee of the outwarde and materiall signes,The aūswer as also for the difference of the tymes, and for certain other propertees.

               In whiche place Austen semeth onely to haue regarde to the difference of the tymes. Also thesame Austen in his litell traictise of the vtilitie and profite of dooynge true penaunce, writeth in verai plaine woordes, that the olde fathers whan thei had Manna, did eate the self same thyng that we dooe nowe eate. For (saieth he) thei didde eate the selfe same spirituall meate. And what is it to saye the selfe same, but that it is thesame whiche we also dooe eate? And for that it might to some persone appere and seme a thyng vnconuenient, that we shoulde haue no more nowe then the Iewes than had, he stil beateth vpon the testimonie of Paule aboue alledged, to whom (saieth Austen) it was not enoughe to saie, that the olde fathers had a spirituall meate, but he thought it good to adde moreouer and saie, thei had the same self meate that we dooe rece

Neither doeth it make any thyng againste vs that certaine affirme him to speake of a spirituall eatyng, because that the Patriarkes didde beleue in Christe to come.

            And Secondarily for that the olde fathers didde not onely beleue in their hearte in Christe to come, but did also receyue a token and signe of the thynge whiche thei beleued, that is to wete, Manna or Water. Wherefore the thing didde not passe by feythe onelye: and so Austens sentence and sayinge standeth styll in his force, that the meate of the olde fathers

was not onely spirituall as ours is, but also the selfe same that we eate, Neither is it of any great force or effecte if thou obiecte out of thesame Augustine vpon the thirtie seuenth Psalme, in the Prologue, wher he putteth difference betwene the newe and olde Sacramentes: where he semeth to assigne three pointes of difference. First, that in the one a Salueour is promised, and in the other he is geuen. And afterward he saieth that our Sacramentes are more easie, fewer in numbre, more full of maiestee, and more blisseful. And at last he addeth, that the others wer as toyes or iapes in childrens handes: but in our Sacramentes to bee conteyned some thyng of more vtilitee and substancialnesse. And these circumstaunces are to bee vnderstāded as touchyng the first point concernyng the promissiō of Christ to come. But not withstādyng that thei had not yet in verai dede receyued him i

               eashe: yet neuerthelesse to the fathers beleuyng in the said promission, he was spiritually geuen to meate. But our Sacramentes are saied to geue Christe, euen because thei testifie that he is come already, and is no more to be looked for as though he wer not come. Now that our Sacramentes are fewer in noumbre, it is a thing certain, and also, that thei are more easie then the old Sacramentes. Thei also signifie and represēt a more maiestie, because the woordes that are spoken be more open and plain, then thei wer in the old Testamente.

Many kynges & Prophetes haue desired to see the thynges that ye see. &c.

But by all these circumstaunces it is not concluded ne proued that the Sacramentes of the olde fathers (at the leste wyse as touching the thing and substaunce of the misterie) had not thesame thynges conteyned in them, that our Sacramentes now haue.
            For Cyprian in the third Epistle of the second booke hath these wordes folowyng:Cyprian. Oure Lorde Iesus Christ offered the self same thyng, that Melchisedech had offered, that is to wete, breade and wyne, that is to saye, his bodye and bloud. Augustine

Thesame Austen a litell after: Thesame meate than (sayeth he, & the same drinke: but that was to suche as vnderstood and beleued it: but to them that vnderstood it not, that same was than onely Manna, and that same was than onely bare Water and nothing els, but to the beleuing and feithfull, it was euen the veraisame that it nowe is. For at that tyme was Christ yet to come, but now he is come: To come, and comed alreadie are distincte wordes: but Christe is bothe than and nowe, all one: And Bertram
               Bertram one of the wryters in these later tymes thus wryteth. Yet neuerthelesse that our aunciente fathers of the olde lawe did eate the selfe same spirituall meate that we dooe, and dranke the selfe same spirituall drinke that we now dooe, Sainct Paule dooeth earnestly affirme.

The selfe same spirituall meate. &c. And thesame Bertram anon after saieth in this manier: For the selfe same Christe whiche at this daye doeth in the feithfull congregacion through his almightifull power spirituallye turne breade and wyne into the fleashe of his body and into the liquour of his own bloud: the self same Christ did at that time inuisibly weorke Manna that was geuen from heauen to bee his bodye, and the water powred doune from heauen to bee his owne bloud.

It is the nature of a Sacramente to bee made of these two thynges. But after these mennes myndes, the el

               mental thynges (as breade and wyne) be gone: and than ought Austen not to haue saied. The wordes come to the elemente: but he should rather haue sayed the woordes take awaye the elemente.

                  d reason there is of the signes and the thinges in this Sacramente. Bread dooeth therefore signifie the bodye of Christe, because it fedeth and maketh strong and is a great sustenaunce to mannes life, which propertee and operacion we can not attribute or applye the accidentes of breade
                  •
                as to witnesse of it, or to the taste of it. Again in that that many cornes or graynes bee put together and so breade made of them: there maye bee a significacion in it to represent or signifie a bodie mystical and suche significacion can not bee conteyned in the whytenesse or the taste, or the other accidentes

of breade. Wherupon it was that Paule sayed: we beeyng many folke are one lofe or one bread and one bodye: because we bee partakers of one loffe or breade.

In this poynte thei stande in greate doubte, and some there bee, that hath sayed (as the Maister of the sentences witnesseth in the fourth booke) that the substaunce of Christes body it is that is broken there, but this opinion is disproued & ouerthrowē of the said Maister of the sentences,
               Christes bodye is nowe past beeing subiecte to any breakīg or other casualtees. in that yt Christes bodye is immortal, & therfore it can not now any more be subiect to any suche thinges as breaking, or to any other newe casualtees Some others againe there haue been, which haue affirmed that same breakyng not to be a true breakyng in verai dede: but onely to appere so to bee, and to seme so to our sight. But this saying also maye goe emongst the refuse, because we maye not of congruence appoynte or make in this matier a perpetual and an endlesse fashion of mocking and deludyng Christen people. But at last they saye, that it is nothyng but the accidentes onelye that are broken. And whereas they put and hold the quantitee that is in the Sacrament to bee a quantitee in manier onely Mathematicall, that is to saie, not reall nor materiall in dede, but separated and deuided from all materiall

substaunce, that maie bee seen or felte, and consisting in our imaginacion onely and in our vnderstandyng, whiche quantitee if it bee diuided or broken in pieces, it is onely so conceiued in our reasō, & by vertue of our vnderstādyng: these breakers of the Sacrament, do so breake the said quantitee that the partes & pieces ther of maie moste manifestly and moste euidentlye be seen to bee veraily and truely broken in dede, and soondred one from another.

I can not tell what manier a corporall or bodily eating of Christes fleashe, from the whiche opinion and imaginacion Christe called them backe by and by, whan he saied, that his woordes wer spirite and lyfe, and that the fleashe profited nothing. Yea and ferther he did caste foorth vnto them an expresse mencion of his ascending vp into heauen, saying: what if ye shall se the sonne of manne ascendinge vp into heauen, where he was before? but these men saie that thei are nothing of the opinion that the Capernaites were of.In obiecciō of the aduersaries.

But of the speciall imaginacion of the Capernaites (whatsoeuer it wer) our men cannot haue any perfecte knowlage: but a verai lykely matier it is, that the Capernaites did carnally vnderstand the matier. And therfore thei wer admonished with mencion of Christes ascendinge vp into heauen. Why dooe not these men than take suche lessons for their instruccion out of that place, whiche dare affirme and saye, that thei eate Christe both carnally and corporally? what doeth it skill or what difference is it, whether one take Christes bodye by piece meale; or whether he swalowe it down al whole, if he mene the thyng carnally & fleashly, as ye

But suche manier a bodye (with suche manier properties as Christe had at that tyme) coulde not (as these menne dreame) bee fleashly and really conteyned in lytell cakes of breade. But some others (whiche thynke themselues men of a wyser sorte,) saie that Christe had in hymselfe a body bothe passible and mortall (as is aforesaid,) but yet thei saye, that in the breade he gaue his body gloryfied and spirituall.
            But than dooeth that saying make againste these menne, whiche we reade in the woordes of the Lord: This is my body, which is deliuered for you, and this is my bloude, whiche shall bee shed for you, by whiche woordes he playnlye

For Christe had not these thynges glorifyed and vnpassible till after his resurreccion. But leat vs suppose that the matier wer as thei holde. Than dooe we thus argue. The state and properties of a passible bodye, and of a glorifyed bodye, be contrary the one to the other
                  •
                so that they can not in one respecte bee in one bodye together and at one tyme: wherefore it foloweth, yf ye wyll haue bothe the sayed contraries of passible and glorifyed to bee in Christes bodye bothe at one selfe tyme: that ye make Christes body a double bodye.

            This Sacramente is not onely sayed to bee the Sacramente of the body of our sauiour Christe, but also of the mistical body of Christ: Wherefore Paule in thissame his former epistle to the Corinthians saied: Ye bee the body of Christe, and also: We beeyng many, are one lofe and one bodye, all we that be partakers of one bread or lofe.

               The .xlv. ArgumenteAnd where as they do ofte tymes in thys matter brynge forth manye myracles agaynste vs: men must not be so quycke, nor so lyght of credence, as to beleue euerye thynge. For myracles are not wounte to be brought forth, but bycause they be straunge thynges and wonderfull, by reason of whose seldom effect, and vnwonted comminge to passe: Goddes word maye be the more estemed and regarded. For at such times when suche miracles chaunce: menne be striken with a greate wonderynge. And thereby men are easelye or quyckely perswaded to regarde, and to beleue christes sayinges, and doctryne.
            But in thys sacramente there is nothynge chaunged as farre as our eye can iudge, neyther is there anye suche chaunge made, as myghte prouoke vs to anye wonderynge. Wherfore these trāsubstantiatours seme in vayne to seke anye healpe for their purpose by myracles.It is in vaine for the transubstā

            But the breakynge of the breade, (as these menne theim selues graunte also) is a Sacramente and a sygne of Christes breakynge or sufferynge vpon the crosse, and yet there is no suche transubstanciation of the same, into Christes passion, yt the breakyng of ye breade shoulde make the sayde passion, or sufferynge of Christe to be really there present: therfore shal not the breade neyther bee chaunged into Christes bodye to make hys bodye carnallye presente.
            And so, seynge that thys opynion hath nothynge in it but onelye pratlynge and babblynge aboute tryfles, and bryngeth men, as it were into a maze, that they canne not gette oute of, whan they are once in, it auayleth nothynge at al nor helpeth to the furderaūce of deuotion or godlines.

Whyche Eucharistia or sacramente of thankes geuing is made of two partes, the one earthly, and the other heauenlye. &c. Here fyrste and formoste, he denieth not that the sacrament of thankes geuynge, called Eucharistia (as is aforesayde) is bread, excepte ye wyl make it, or suppose it to be suche commune breade, as men do communely vse to eate at theyr repastes. And afterwarde he sayeth, that the sayde sacramente doeth consyste of two thynges, of whyche two thynges, the one is earthlye, and that is the breade, the other is heauenlye, as Christes bodye. And lyke as the veritye is kept in the tone parte (that is to wete, as touching Christes bodye) euen so muste the veritye be kepte in the other parte also (that is to wete, as touchyng the breade).
            And he addeth by a similitude, or comparison. And so our bodyes (sayth he) receyuynge the sacramente of thankes geuynge, are nowe no longer subiecte to corruption.

Marcion, he sayeth, When Christ had taken bread, and had deuided it amonge hys disciples, he made that breade hys bodye, by sayinge: Thys is my bodye, That is to saye, the fygure of my bodye, but it shoulde not be a figure of hys bodye, vnlesse the body hadde bene a verye true body, in dede.
            
               Origen
               Origen vpon the boke of Numeri in the .xvi. homilie we are said, yt we do not onely drinke Christes bloud,

whan it is ministred vnto vs in the ordinarye geuing of the Sacramentes: but also whan we receiue his woordes. Which self same thing also Hierome wrote in one place, vpon the third chapitur of Ecclesiastes. The same Origen also vpon the .xxvi. Chapitur of Matthew, hath these wordes: Panis iste, quem deus verbum Corpus suum esse fatetur, verbum est nutritorium animarum: that is to saie, this breade whiche god the woorde (whiche is Christe) dooeth plainelye affirme and saie bee his bodye, is a woorde good and holsome to nourishe oure soules. The same Origen also in the seuenthe homelie vpō the booke of Moses entitled Leuiticus thus speaketh: For euen in the ghospels also there is a litteral sense which killeth, and not in the olde testamēt onely. For if ye folow the litteral sence in this sentence, vnles ye eate my fleash. &c. And in thesame boke in ye nynth homely: doe not thou staigh nor dwel in the bloude of the fleashe, but learne rather the bloude of the woorde, and heare himselfe sayinge vnto thee, that this is my bloode whiche is shed forthe for you. The same Origen agayn vpon the fiftienth chapitur of Matthewe: The breade that is halowed, passeth into the bealie (as touchyng his material parte) and is cast forth into the draught. &c. And within a fewe woordes after he saieth thus. Neither is it the matter or substaunce of the breade, but it is goddes woorde spoken vpon the said breade, whiche profiteth those that eate the same not vnworthely. The same Origen in another place agaynst Celsus in the eight booke:Celsus. whan we haue geuen thankes for the benefites of God bestowed vpon vs, we eate

And the same Ciprian where he declareth and expouneth the Lordes prayer, calleth the Lordes bodye breade, And in hys sermon of the Lordes supper he sayeth, that we dooe not whette or sharpen oure tethe, but sayeth, that wee breake or eate the breade onelye wyth a pure faith. The same Cipriā in a sermon which he entitleth de chrismate that is, of the Chrisme, sayeth plainely that Sacramentes haue the names of those thynges, whyche thynges they sygnifye. Whych

                  Quid paras dentem, aut vetrem? Crede, et manducasti.
               
That is to saye, why dost thou make readye thy toth or thy bealye: beleue thou, and thou hast eaten it. And these wordes are in the fyue and twentye treasyse vpon Iohn. But the same Cipriā, in hys thyrde epistle of the seconde boke, to Cecilius sayth: that the bloude of Christe is shewed or sette forthe in the wyne. And agaynste those menne whyche were called Aquarii, he holdeth that the bloude of Christe can not appeare to be presente in the cuppe or chalyce, if the wyne cease to be there: whyche thynge shoulde so come to passe, by the transubstantiation whyche these men do put.

And in hys sermon vpon the Lordes supper
                  •
                he wryteth that the sygnes be chaunged into Christes body, but yet in suche wyse, that he taketh hys similitude of Christ him selfe, in whom the humanitie or humaine nature appeared, & the godheade was not to be sene, but was inuisible. By whyche similitude ye see, that he meaneth, that lyke as two natures remayned in Christe, so also in thys Sacramente two natures be reserued,
            Also Ciprian in the thyrde epistle of the second boke hath these wordes: After such sorte as neyther floure or meale alone, or water alone can be Christes body, vnlesse both thynges be ioygned, & coupled to gyther and made into one whole masse or lumpte, by knyttynge it togyther into one breade or lofe, wyth the whyche selfe same breade beynge nowe putte to the vse of a Sacrament, our people is playnelye shewed and declared to be a people ioygned togyther in one.
            
               Athanasius also declarynge these wordes of Christ.Athanasius If any man speake a worde agaynst the sonne of man, it shall be forgeuen hym, but he whiche speaketh agaynst the holy ghost, shal neuer haue it pardened or for geuē him in thys world, nor in the world to come, wryteth in thys maner. And howe greate a body should it be to bryng to passe that al the world shoulde eate and fede thereof. But he bryngeth in afterwardes, that the matter shuld be vnderstāded spiritually, and that Christe in that place therefore made mention and spake of his ascension againste the Capernaites.

And the same man about the same place, saieth, that we drynke of Christes mysticall cuppe for a figure of Christes bloud. And in the fourthe chapitur of the fourth boke entitled de sacramentis, that is to saie, of the sacramentes, where he putteth the chaunge of the signes, he treateth also of our chaungynge into Christe, and yet is there not anye transubstanciacion sayed to bee in suche as receiue the Sacrament.

And not many lines after, he saieth: If so great a strength and vertue bee in the woordes of the lorde that thynges begynne to be that thei were not afore: how much more than can he weorke and bryng to passe, that those thinges maye still remayne the same that they were before, and yet

maye be chaunged into an other thynge too.
            
               Hierome vpon Mathewe sayeth playnlye,Hierome. that the bodye and bloude of Christe is represented by the breade, and by the wyne.
            
               Chrisostome vpon the second epistle to the Corhinthians sayeth:Ch

                  isostom that not onely that thyng is Christes bodye whych is sette before the Christians at the lordes table: but also that the pore folcke are hys bodye, to whome we are bounde to shewe and to minister the worckes of charitye. For euen the same Christe whyche sayde, thys is my bodye, sayde also by his worde, that he was in nede and necessitie whan poore folcke lacked: and that he had kyndenes and benefyte shewed to hym selfe, whan they receyued our almesdedes. The same Chrisostome in the eleuenth homelie vpon Mathewe, in the worcke whyche is intituled, Imperfectum sayeth thus. It is not christes bodye and christes bloude, whyche is contayned in the holye vesels, Sed misterium corporis et sanguinis Christi, that is to say, But it is the mistery of Christes body, & bloude. The same Chrisostome in the .xxvii. homelie vpon the eleuenth chapitur of the second epistle to the Corinthyans. For as christe bothe in the breade, and also in the cuppe sayde. Do ye thys in remembraunce of me, as often as ye shal eate of thys bread, and drynke of thys cuppe. &c. The same vpon the .xxii. psalme. Thou hast prepared an eatynge table in my syght, that he might shew forth daily to vs in the sacramēt bread and wyne accordynge to the order or fashyon vsed of

               Austen.
               Austen hathe manye testimonies of thys mattier fyrst vpon the .lxxxix. psalme. Ye shal not eate this body which you see with your eye, neither shal ye drinke the same very blud, whych the Iewes wil shede forth vpon the crosse. But the thinge which I speake vnto you is a mysterie, and an highe secrete poynte, whiche if it be spirituallye vnderstanded, shall quicken you to life. Also in the thyrde booke, de trinitate, Panis ad hoc factus in sacramento accipiendo consumitur. that is to saye, the breade whyche was made for this purpose, is cō
               sumed awaye, whan the sacrament is receyued. Neither is there anye tytle or reason, why Fysher late bishope of Rochester shuld so haue gone aboute to racke thys sentence, and to apply it to the shewe breades of the olde lawe, whyche were called, Panes prepositionis. For we haue before this declared and by diuerse reasons proued, that hys declaration doth not, ne canne bee agreable to serue for that matter. Firste bicause that if thou folowe the easye and plaine sence of the wordes, and that sence of the letter, whiche offereth it selfe, and commeth to thy minde at the fyrste syght or readinge: thou shalte see plainelye, that Austen there speaketh of Eucharistia, whyche is thys Sacramente of thankes geuynge, as is afore sayde. And it is a worde muche vsed to signyfye the Sacramente of

Christes bodye. &c.
            And Erasmus in the worckes of Austen whiche he corrected, and sette forthe of newe, when he commeth to the wordes aboue cited,
                  
                     ••
                  asmus hath for a note in the margente of the booke directlye agaynste the sayde clause sette thys worde, Eucharistia. to signifye that the sayde clause is mente, of thys Sacramente of Christes bodye and bloude.
            Moreouer the sayde Austen a little after, in the same Chapitur, and whyle he yet treateth vppon the same matter, dothe so plainly make mention of Eucharistia, that the verye aduersarie canne not denye it, nor saye againste it. And he hadde wrytten of the same Eucharistia, before in the fourthe chapitur of the selfe same boke: whan he beganne to treate of the same matter. Ye maye adde to thys also, that the word Sacramēt is of purpose expreslie mente, and playnelye named in these wordes of Austen whych we haue now in hād. For if he woulde thys worde Sacramente to be taken cōmunely, it myght euen as well in euery behalfe haue bene applyed to those other thynges which Austen in that place had rehearsed before, (as for example to the brasen serpente, and to the stone that was erected vp by Iacob) as it myghte be applied or referred to the loues of propositiō, or the shewe breades afore mentioned.
            But Austen whan he spake and treated of those other thynges, dyd not make any expresse mention of thys worde Sacramente, whyche worde afterward in thys clause, he woulde in no wise leaue oute, bicause he woulde vs to vnderstande hym directlye to speake of Eucharistia,
            
            
               Fynallye, to cōclude the very wordes of Austen are these: The bread whiche was made for this purpose is cousumed in receyuynge of the sacramente, or whan the Sacramente is receyued, whyche thynge doeth in no wyse agree, nor can not be applyed to the shewe breades of the olde Testamente. For the lawes of the shewe bread were not made to any such vse or ende that they shoulde be eaten, but that they beynge sette vpon a table, shoulde remayne there before the Lorde, and so continue from tyme to tyme in that place, for the whyche cause they were called in the Hebrue tonge. Panim.

            Afterwardes by a lyttle chaunce (as ye woulde say) and of an other occation it came to passe, that they were eaten, for thys cause doubtelesse, to auoyde leste they shoulde putrefye before the Lorde. And for that cause, were they chaunged weakelye. And whan they were once offered, & dedicated to God, he would haue thys honoure geuen to theim, that they shoulde be eaten of the priestes. But the breade of oure sacramente of Eucharistia, is made verily for this onely purpose and ende, that it shoulde be eaten and spente in receyuinge of the sacramente. And to the argumentes that I haue alreadie made, I adde and ioygne thys one more also, whiche is of more force.
            For saynte Austen speaketh by the presente tense, and sayeth, it is spente, and not, it was spente, whych oughte to haue bene sayde, if he hadde spoken of the fygure and ceremonye of the olde Testamente. In the ninteenth chapitur of hys boke entitled, De side, that is to saye, of fayeth, to one Peter, he callethe it the Sacramente of bread and wyne.
            
               He doeth enstruc
                  •
               e the sayd Peter in the feithe, of the memorie of Christ, & of his death euē at large: but yet of this transubstanciacion, the whiche these men doe now at this daie so earnestly harpe vpon, and labour to bring in, he speaketh not so muche as one worde. In the twentieth booke against Faustus, and the one & twentieth chapitur, he declareth that the fleashe and bloude of Christ was promised to vs in the olde testament vnder the similitude of the sacrifices, and geuen to vs in dede vpon the crosse, and in the sacramentes to bee celebrated vnder a remēbraūce or memorial of hym. And in the fyue and twentieth chapitur of the one and twentieth booke de ciuitate dei, he plainely affirmeth that the wicked and vngodlye sorte dooe not eate the veray thing of the sacrament, that is to saye, the body of Christe. For that man (sayeth he) oughte not to be thought to eate the bodye of Christe whiche is not in the bodye of Christe, and in whome Christe dooeth not dwell, nor he in Christe. And in the twentieth treactise vpon Ihon, he hath euen the like saying And in the thirtieth treactise, he sayeth that the bodye of Christe is in one certain place in heauen, but the veritie of it to be sprede abroade in euerie place. Whiche thing he sayth for this consideracion, because the truth is a spiritual thing, and is continually euermore with the feithfull. And they that dooe receiue the communion, wheresoeuer they bee, dooe confesse Christ, and beleue that he had a true bodye and not a counterfaicte or a phantastical body, as the Heritikes dyd suppose. In the booke againste Adimantius one of the Manychies secte in the twelfth chapitur, he writeth in this manner: The Lorde dyd not doubte to saye, this is

my body, whereas yet he gaue them but the signe of his body. Neither is it of any force yf one woulde saye, he gaue them bothe the signe and the thyng. For Austen had no respecte hereunto, but his mynde was to declare, that it was a figurate speache, and lyke to the other which he allegethe out of the Deuterenomi. Bloud is the soule or life. The Lorde (sayeth he) therfore dyd not doubte, because we are some what bolde in vsyng some tropes, that is to saye, such maniers of speakyng as sometimes the scripture doth vse. In the thyrde booke de doctrina Christiana, that is to saye, of christian doctrine, and the sixth chapitur, he doeth teache vs that this saying in the sixthe of Iohn is figurate, Except ye eate the fleashe of the sonne of man. &c. For (saieth he) here semeth an haynous thyng to bee commaunded. For it is a thing more horrible and odious to eate the fleashe of man,Here is partly touched the place that is in the seconde booke against the aduersitie of the lawe and prophetes in the ninthe chapitur. than to kylle hym: and to drincke his bloud, than to shede it Therefore (saieth he) it is a figure geuing vs enstruction that we swetelye and profitablye haue in memorie that the fleashe of Christe was crucifyed & wounded for vs. In his epistle to Boniface he declareth moste playnly, that the Sacramentes beare the name of those thynges wherof thei be
                  •
                sacramentes. And he expresseth by name that the sacramente of the body of Christe is the bodye of Christe after a sorte: and he sayeth a litell after, that the Sacramente of the bloud of Christe, is the bloude of Christe. And al this dyd Austen write that he might proue baptisme to be the sacrament of feith, and that therefore it maye bee sayed, that it is feith: & that childrē baptised haue feith because thei receiue that a sacrament.
            
               And leste any man should saye, y• they be signes of a thing which present in veray substaunce (as these men terme it) leat vs diligently weygh the similitudes that are brought in of this father & auncient doctour whō we haue now alleged. Which is (sayth Austen) much lyke for an exaumple as whan Easter tyme is nere at hande, we thus saie: Tomorowe shall be the Lordes passiō: or, ye next day after to morow shal y• lordes passiō be. And on ye sunday beyng Eastur daye, we saye: Christ hath this daye arisen agayne frō death to lyfe. Wheras yet these thinges be not now presēt, but wer doen long agon. And so Austē after these wordes affirmeth yt the baptisme of ye litel chyldrē is feyth, which feith neuerthelesse ye chyldrē haue not presently: Yea & ferthermore ye same Austen (as it appereth in ye second distinction, in ye chapitur yt beginneth, interrogo uos, yt is, I aske of you) sayeth, yt it is an offense of equal and of lyke negligence to suffre ye word of god which is preached to skyp out of our myndes, and to leat parte of ye sacramentes fall vnto the yearth. But yf we graunte this transubstanciacion, thā wer this thinge not so agreable. For it semeth a ferre more vnmete thing that the veray body of Christ should fal vnto the yearth or to be troden on, thā to heare any part of holy scripture negligētly, ferthermore vpō the third psalme he saith, that Christ had Iudas wt him at this feaste whan he deliuered y• figure of his body. They be wōt to saye, ye the body of Christe couered vnder the acc

               ēdtes in this sacrament is a fygure or signe of himselfe, euen as he hanged on ye crosse a dead bodye without life & bloud: And ye the bloud which is hidden vnder ye accidētes of wyne, is the figure and signe of his bloudeshedde on the aulter of the crosse.
            
               But what is he that cannot see and perceiue all this same, to bee these mennes fond and vaine imaginacions? For the signe and figure ought to bee more sensible and more easie to perceiue, and to be better knowen then the thyng whiche is signifyed by it. And therefore the master of the sentences defineth a sacramente after Austens opinion in this maner: A Sacramente (saieth he) is a visible signe of an vnuisible grace. But the bodye of Christe hidden vnder the accidentes (as these mennes doctrine teacheth) is as vnknowen as that whiche did hange on the crosse. Yea (and if a man maye saye the trueth) more vnknowen too, and more obscure or darke to perceiue, than is that whiche is signifyed whiche thinges are muche ageynste the nature bothe of a signe and of a figure. For the bodye of Christ (as it hanged on the crosse) is more easie to bee knowen and comprehended in a mannes mynde, then as it is of these men placed in the sacramente.

               Leo the Bysshoppe of Rome in his Epistle to the cleargi and people of Constantinople wryteth that this distribution is mystycall, and that it is a spirituall norishment and heauenly vertue that we here receiue, to the ende that we maye be altered and transefourmed or chaunged into the fleashe of Christe, who for our sakes tooke oure fleashe vpon hym.

And where as in the counsell holden at Ephesus, there be fell a variaunce betwixte Iohn the Patriarke of Antioche, and Cyrill the Byshop of Alexandria.

            And the Papistes for as much as they haue espied that he is moste playnelye agaynste transubstanciation, they haue excused him two waies. Fyrste that the churche had not as yet in his time determined this matter, as thoughe we did searche what the Pope wt hys Cardinals haue decreed, either at Constaunce or in the counsell where Beringatius was condempned, and not rather, what was bothe preached and taught & also beleued in the olde church. Secondelye they excuse Theodoritus, and saye, that in writing against the heritikes whan he traicted of mysteries, he

leaned some what to muche the other waye agaynste transubstantiation, to thys intent and purpose, that hys aduersaries mighte the better, and the more effectuallye be confuted.
            But howe triflynge an excuse thys is, it maye very well appeare, of the whole sequell of thys wryters processe in hys wrytynge, where as one maye

            They alledge furthermore that he speaketh sumetime verye honourablye, and reuerentelye of the sacramente in thys same boke.

            Hys boke is a disputation agaynst suche persons as denye that Christe had a true bodye, and do saye that hys bodye in the tyme of hys ascention was all togyther chaunged into a diuine nature.
            Firste he bringeth in for his purpose, the prophecy of the aunciente Patriarke Iacob, out of the .xlix. Chapter of Genesis, to the ende that he might therby make him selfe awaye to bringe his argumentes oute of the sacramentes. And his wordes ben these.
            But for the better and more plainer declaration of

the matter, I the translatour haue thought necessarie to admonish the good christian reader, to vnderstand & to note y• the purpose of Theodoritus is, to proue that the body of Christ (as it is nowe in heauen raignynge in the glorye of hys father) is hys verye true, and naturall bodye, and the same bodye whyche he hadde whan he was conuersaunte here on earth in hys manhoode, and that the same bodye remaynethe euen styll, and euer shall do, in the same his verye true nature of manhoode, that it than hadde, and is not chaunged into the nature and substaunce of hys godheade.
            For euen at those dayes some heritiques did beginne to deuise and to write of Christe, that after hys resurrection and ascention, hys manhoode was now chaunged into his godhead, and was no longer a natural bodye, so that he was not now both god & man (sayde they) but God onelye, for as muche as by rysynge frome deathe to lyfe, and by ascending into heauen he hadde ouercomed al corruptebilitie, and hadde cast of all earthlinesse of hys natural body, and of his manhoode.
            And the wordes are written in Theodoritus in maner and forme of a dialoge betwene a good Christian mā, beyng of right opiniōs in matters of religiō whō we shal here at thys tyme cal by the name of Orthodoxus, as the auctoure doeth, and a Compaig

Yea I know it very wel. Ortho. Dost thou know also that in an other place againe he called his body, wheat, corne? Aduer. Yea, I knowe that too, euen verye well. For I haue heard that he sayde. The houre is come that the sonne of man muste be glorified. And except the wheate corne being caste downe into the earth do there dye, it remayneth it self alone, but if it dye, it bringeth forth muche frute. Orthod. Trulye in the very geuing and deliuerynge of the mysteries, he called the breade hys body, and the cup he called hys bloud. Aduer. In dede so did he name it. Orthod.

Therfore compare nowe the ymage or firste paterne with the counterpayne, and thou shalt see the similitude. For the figure muste of necessitie bee agreable and aunswerable to the truith. For the self same bodye hath verayly his owne former kynde, his owne former shape, his owne former circumscription (that is to saye, occupying of a rome and place accordyng to his quantitee if it wer so requisite,) and (to speake plainly without any subtilties) euen the very same corporall and bodely substaunce that it had before. But from the tyme of his resurrection foorthwarde it became immortall, and had ouercomed all corruptibilitee and was iudged worthie to bee placed in the seate of glorie whiche is on the right hande of God, and wurshipped it is of all creatures, as beyng the veray naturall bodye of our Lorde.

               Bernarde in his sermon of the supper of the Lord,Bernarde. doeth make a manifeste similitude of a ringe, whereby a manne doeth receyue either the promesse of Matrimonie,

or the possession of any dignitie, as it is vsed in makyng of Byshoppes, whereas the ryng or croasier staffe, or Rotchet, be signes or tokens of the thinges whiche are geuen or graunted, and yet thei bee no vayne signes, for thei do moste surely bringe with them the thynges that they signifie, the whiche same thynge also he declareth to be dooen in the Sacramentes.
            Nowe muste we answere to the argumentes of these menne, where with thei gooe aboute to proue their transubstantiation. And as concernyng the first, we aunswere, that Christ did promisse vs his fleashe or his bodye and bloude, to be our meate and dryncke and that in the sixth Chapitur of Ihon, whiche thing he dooeth as ofte as we dooe truelye beleue that he dyed for vs, he dyd also perfourme the same, whan at his laste Supper he ordeyned this Sacramente, for he ioygned the sygnes to that spirituall eatyng. But they dyd most chiefelye and principally laye agaynste vs this sentence. This is my bodye, aboute the veritie of whiche sayinge is nowe all oure controuersie, but all oure contencion consisteth in this onelye poyncte, howe and in what mannier it is his bodye for bothe partes, that is to weete, as well oure aduersaries as we dooe holde that it is a true proposicion or sentence. And all oure contencion and striefe is onelye aboute the sense or meanynge of it.
            Thei saye, it is a playne sentence: & we on the other syde put them in remembraunce of that whiche Augustine teacheth in his booke entitled de doctrina Christiana,
               
that is, of Christiā doctrine. Where he saieth, that one place must not be so expouned, that it be contrarie to manye other, but rather so as it agree with manye others.

My father is greater then I, Thou dost apply this saying onely to the humayne nature of Christ bycause that in other places of the scripture the godheade of Christe is declared and playnelye taught, as

in the fyrste chapter of Iohn, & in the ninthe chapter of the epistle to the Romains, and in the fyrst Chapter of the first epistle of sainte Iohn.
            Also Christ sayeth,In expouning of one place, a

But if ye haue an eye to other places, ye shall see that it is figuratelye spoken. Saincte Paule hath this sayinge: Pray ye without intercession or ceassing And anone ther started vp a kynde of heritiques called Euchite,
               Euchitae a kinde of heritiques cō
                  cerninge prayer. whyche thought that we ought to vse continual prayers, neuer ceasyng to murmure, then wher as yet it is sayde in an other place. He that hathe not care of them that belonge to hym, specially of such as be of hys houshold, hath renounced the fayth, & is worsse then an infidell.

                if ye take thē as they sounde in wordes, at the firste apprearaunce they are but songes or ballades of loue, or maryage Songes. We must not therfore alwayes alledge the plainenes of the words, & go no further. Christ saith, He that hath eares to hear, let him hear, and he that readeth, let him vnderstand.
            Neyther is it conueniente by and by, to take the fyrste sence that sheweth or offreth it selfe without regardynge or considerynge and conferryng of other places wyth it. Christe sayde to hys Apostles, Beware of the leuen of the Phariseis. The Apostles by and by thoughte that he hadde spoken of

breade, where as Christe spake of theyr doctrine. He sayed also. Lazarus our frende slepethe. Here dyd the Apostles slepe also, and sayde. If he slepe, he shall do well inoughe, & recouer agayne. where as Christe spake of hys death. The Lorde sayeth in an other place. Destroye you thys temple, and in three dayes I shall builde it vp agayne. neyther dyd the Apostles vnderstande that he spake of hys bodye. He that kepeth my commaundementes shall not dye for euer. And here also dyd the Iewes thynke that he spake of the bodilye deathe. Necodemus dyd grosselye vnderstande the newe generation & byrthe that Christe spake of. Neither was the Samaritane woman anye thing lesse deceyued aboute that matter whyche Christ promised hyr.
            The Hebrues also were deceyued whan Christe sayde vnto them. Abraham did se my dayes, and did reioyce. Let theim not therefore saye euermore vnto vs, thys scripture is plaine, This is my body, for we answere thē, yt it is plaine as cō
               cerning ye significatiō of ye wordes. But the sence of ye words is not plaine, as apeareth in such other like sē
               tēces as these. Christe is a stone, Christe is a lambe, Ye are the bodies of Christe, Wee (though we be many) ar one bread, & one body, Al these be the wordes of god, & we may saye of theym, that they be playne, and that they be euident, and yet none of thē al proueth transubstātiatiō.

Wherefore there is no cause, why the plainnes of the wordes shoulde so muche be alleged. We muste of other places of scripture, and of the circumstaunces wel consider what is in thys mattier mente aud intended.
            We wyl therfore expoune this proposition, somwhat depelye repetynge the matter from the bottome God was wyllynge to drawe man vnto hym wyth large and greate promises: as, that he woulde make him happye and blessed.
            And bycause he knewe oure beleuynge herte, he woulde that there shoulde be manye benifites of hys shewynge towardes mankind, remayne and appeare in memorie, whereby he might allure and drawe man vnto hym. Wherefore he dyd not onelye giue all creatures vnto man, but also in the tyme of the floude, he deliuered our kinde (whiche hadde full euyll deserued it) from the destruction of the water.
            To Abraham he declared hym selfe very fauorable and louinge. To Isaac also, & to Iacob his sonnes sonne. He prospered their stocke whan they were oppressed, he deliuered them, and gaue them a fruitefull contrye to dwell in, and promoted them to the dignitie of kynges and priestes, and yet were they continually men of a harde beliefe, and did not perfectelye thincke that God owed them good wyll. Wherefore for their infidelitie, he cast them oute into diuers captiuities, & agayne manye sondrye tymes he deliuered them.
            In conclusion to the entente that there shoulde be no place lefte of doubtinge of hys goodnesse, he gaue them the greateste and highest benefite of al benefites that is to wete, hys sonne takynge on him our fleshe, that he shoulde dye on the crosse for oure healthe & saluation,

the whiche benefite was suche and so greate, that Paule to the Romaynes, sayeth: howe hath he not geuē vs al thinges with his sōne: And than lefte thesame so greate and so hyghe a benefite, should any more bee forgotten, his wil and pleasure was, that it should euermore nowe and than bee renewed in this sacrament of thankes geuyng, to then tente that we should continually by faith thinke in our myndes that Christ was geuē by his father to death and that by the beleuyng thereof, we shoulde eate his fleashe and drincke his bloud, whiche thing to thentēt that it might the more effectually bee dooen, the signes of bread and wyne were ioygned vnto it, whiche should more earnestly moue vs then bare woordes alone had been wont to dooe. Therfore whan he saith, This is my body, he vnderstoode none other thing, than he promised in the sixthe of Iohn whan he sayed: I am the bread of life, he spake of himself as concernyng his body and fleashe deliuered to death, or rather that should afterward be deliuered as plainly appereth by his woordes Neither ment he, eny other thyng, but that these thinges shoulde be vnto vs breade and meate, wherwith our solles might be comforted and cōfirmed, and by the mynde or solle the body also should be confyrmed, and so consequentlye all the whole man. Christ therfore at his last supper mēt nor went about nothyng els, but turned and sette the woordes of his former saying: one in anothers place: and lyke as afore he had sayde his bodye and fleashe to be bread, so now placyng the wordes in the contrary ordre, and shewyng forth the bread, he saieth that

the bread is his body. And whyle he pronoūced these woordes. This is my body, it was euē as much as if he should haue sayed: My body receiued by feith shall be vnto you in stede of breade, and shall bee lyke as it wer bread, wherewith ye maie be spiritually fed and nourished. Leat therfore the sence and plaine meaning be this: I geue you breade to eate, and in the meane tyme I propoune and set foorthe vnto you my body which shall bee nailed vpon the crosse, that ye maye with feithefull remembraunce and with moste attentiue mynde spiritually eate thesame with youre selues: and that, as ye eate breade with your body, so ye maye eate my fleashe with your solle. What canne there bee either more easie or more clere and plaine to vnderstand, then this interpretacion and exposicion, or that maye better agree with the promise whiche oure Lorde Iesus Christ made vnto vs in the sixthe chapitur of Ihon? That if any man shall make any earnest matier, that that same first sayinge of Christe, I am the liuely bread. &c. is to be taken and applied to his diuine nature and to his Godheade (as Chrisostome in dede semeth to will it:) Fyrst we saye, that this sence dooeth not veray well agree therwith. For Christ had there entred a talke concernyng the eatyng of his bodye, and in stede of yearthly breade he offred vnto the Capernaites his fleashe to bee eaten: whiche thyng so to bee is euident and plaine euen by the ordre and processe of the woordes, (although he there sayth that the breade was come downe from heauen: For often tymes the thyng that belongeth to his godhead is made common as it were emparted, to his humanitee also
                  •
                But yf this exposicion of Chrisostom be of

suche pith and effecte with them, leat thesame mannes exposicion be of lyke auctoritee with them where he afterwarde auoucheth that same sayinge of Christe: The breade whiche I shall geue, is my fleashe, whiche I will geue for the lyfe of the worlde. &c. to apperteyne to this Sacrament of thankes geuyng called Eucharistia. Neyther dooeth Chrisostome alone holde that opinion: but the other expositurs also dooe assente and agree with hym ther in. Forasmuche therefore as the Lorde dooeth there saye and affirme breade to bee his fleashe: he dooeth now at his supper testifie the selfe same thynge. For shewyng forth the bread he sayeth: This is my bodye. So in bothe places he auoucheth his bodye or his fleashe to bee breade, that is to wete, breade of the solle, and of our substaunce nowe regenerate and borne of newe, whiche breade is to bee spirituallye eaten.
            And thus takyng it,What manier of figu

That if we take it all whole together, that is to wete, the breade, and the thynge offred by the breade that is to saye, Christes bodye: than we admitte the figure of Syuecdoche,Sinecdoche because that thinge is sayed of the whole or of one parte, whiche belongeth to another parte.
            For Synecdoche is, whan that, that belongeth but to a parte of a thynge, is attributed or assigned to the whole: as for an exaumple, if one shoulde saye:

My foote is sore, whan nothyng is sore but his toe or his hele onelye, it were Synecdoche, because that the sorenesse or griefe whiche is in the toe alone, is spoken of the who

            But in case ye refferre the saying to the breade, which dooeth boeth signifie and offre vnto vs the bodye of Christe to bee eaten: it shall than bee a figurate maner of speakyng called Metonimia,
               Metonimia which in our manier of speakyng, is whan the name of the thynge that is signifyed, is geuen to the signe, as here whan the name of Christes bodye is geuen to the breade. In this exposicion also takynge it after this sence laste afore goyng all pointes are light, and easye, and playn to vnderstande: all poinctes of vnconueniences are auoyded, and o

Albeit I knowe that many dooe make cauillations, and woulde haue it taken that there is no trouth nor figuratiue speaking in thys last clause, bycause that Paul dyd restraigne this sayinge, and applied it to a spirituall stone, whyche spirituall stone, they anouch to be Christe trulye, and verilye, and without any trope or figuratiue speakinge at all

And of the lawe of Moses God sayd, that it did put deathe and lyfe, blessinge and curssinge vnto the people of the Hebrewes: which is none other but by the signification and notifiynge of the lawe, the promises and threatenynges of God whiche

Also in this same very epistle to the Corinthians and the same eleuenth chapitur whyche we nowe traicte of. S. Paule wrote that a woman shoulde haue a power on hyr heade, by the whyche worde power, he signifieth a coueringe, by the whiche couerynge, is signified the power and superioritie of the man ouer the woman.
            And in the seconde epistle to the same Corinthians it is cōtayned, that God made Christe to be sinne whiche was nothinge els, but to the likenes of synne and representation of our fleshe. Yea, and the ghoste that was offred vp for synne, was called sinne. And the prestes were sayd

                whych selfe same thing we reade of Christ, whan he sayth. Who so drinketh of this water. &c. In whiche place the Euangeliste mencioneth that Christe spake of the holye ghoste whyche they shoulde afterwarde receiue. Of the Lambe we heare, that it was called Pascha, (thoughe some there be that attempte the same to denye)

But the playne words of ye Hebrue doth declare it where it is sayd. The sacrifice is Pascha, that is the passeouer. By the sacrifice there can not be vnderstanded anye other thinge, but either the slaine hoste that was offred vp, or els that same veray acte of sacrifisynge the sayde host. So we haue the body of Christ expressed, bothe by breade and wine, and also by the acte, as well of eatynge as of drynkinge. And the said Lambe was not the passinge ouer of the Aungel, but onely a monumente and token or signification of hym so passing ouer. Christ sought a place wher he might eat the passeouer with his Apostles, and by the word of passeouer, he vnderstode those meates, & those consecrate or hallowed thynges, which dyd betoken and signifie the passe ouer. S. Paule also said. Christe our passe ouer hath bene offered vp. &c. And in the same place he called Christe hymselfe our solemnitie, & oure passage or passeouer, whych thinges can not be taken nor vnderstanded, but as figuratelye spoken. And the sayde lambe was not the passinge ouer of the aungell whyche was thē to be done, or in doyng: but whiche was done in old tyme, many hundred yeres afore, the remembraunce, whereof was represented by these same externall signes. Here also in thys sacrament we haue the bodye of Christ, that heretofore suffered, not that is nowe at thys present deliuered vnto the crosse, or whose bloud is now at thys day shedde forth but a great while ago. And in case these mē wold straightly expoune the words of Christ, whē he saith. This is my bodye. whyche is betrayed for you. They coulde not chose but saye, that the breade shoulde be crucified, or at leaste wyse Christe couered vnder the

accidentes of the bread in the sacramente, as their exposition and determination is. For Christe shewinge forthe that, y• he thē had in hys handes, sayd, that the same it was that shoulde be betrayed and deliuered, and shedde forthe for them. That if they saye, that in dede the same it was that was betraied and deliuered but not after the same manier, nor in the same fourme or shape, than do they seke interpretacions and expositions of the texte and sterting holes, and do not take the proposition or the clause playnelie as the wordes sound, without any ferther addicion or circumstaūce.
            And the selfe same thynge also ye maye see in the wordes, is betraighed or deliuered, and is shedde forth. The which wordes (if while we pronounce the wordes in the con

            Nowe where Paule sayd that they were gyltye of the body & bloud of ye lord, which eat it vnworthely, & also that such persons dooe eat iudgement vnto them selues, bicause they make no difference of the Lordes bodye, all this is no matter at all.

               t, and touched Christes honoure, that was done about the heade of a man, bycause it was a sygne and token of Christe.
            It is further to be considered, that Paule wrote vnto the Corinthians, whyche were a people not altogyther destitute of fayeth: but they were infected wyth certaine infirmities, and as for such kinde of people, we haue not sayde that they receyue onelye the sygnes, and not to haue the body of Christe: but it is of infideles, Epicuriās that thynke there is no god, and of suche as are cutte of frome the congregation, of suche it is (I saye) that we pronounce that they receyue the sygnes onelye.
            Wherfore it myght well be sayd to the Corinthiās not only as cōcernyng the signes, but also as touching

the thyng of the Sacrament, that they were guiltie of the bodye and bloud of the lorde, and that they didde not putte a difference betwene the Lordes bodye, for asmuche as thei receiued the thynges with feith, and did not expresse the same feith in theyr liuyng. And here this thyng also is diligently to be marked, that Paule whan he traicteth of the sacramentall accion or dooing, that is to wete, of eatynge and drynkynge of the sacrament at the veray receyuyng of it, he so speaketh of it, that he calleth it breade, saying: Who so eateth this breade. &c: but afterwarde whan he goeth about to shewe the fault of ill receiuing it how great and grieuous it is, than doeth he so make mencion of it, that he calleth it the lordes bodye. Ferthermore if the matier bee well examined, and iustely rekoned, it shall bee found that in all his trai

               yng of this Sacramente, the Apostle hath oftener expressed the name of bread, then he hath mencioned the Lordes body. For ye maye well fynd that fiue tymes he made expresse mencion of breade: but of the Lordes bodye no more but fower tymes. But now is it to bee seene and considered, what occasions thei bee that dooe so earnestly moue vs to take this clause and sayinge of Chr

Fyrst and formoste we dooe consider that Christ himselfe was presente at the supper, so that it was a thyng nedelesse for hym to shewe his bodye to the Apostles. For thei sawe hym there presente with theyr yies. Secondly how coulde it possibly bee doen, that hymselfe should really and corporally or bodylye eate his owne selfe? And that he did cōmunicate with his Apostles, is not onely aff

and auncient wryters, but also Christ hymselfe doeth saye it, as thou haste in the ghospell of Matthewe, wher Christ sayeth: After this tyme I shall not drynke of this fruite of the vinetree. Ferthermore we haue a regard, that here it is treated of the memoryal and remembraunce of his death and passion, wherein is well to be notifyed that there is a figuratiue speakyng in the woordes. And as for these transubstanciatours we se that thei dooe chaunge the tymes, so that, that whiche is spoken by the future tense, that is to saye, for the tyme to come, or by the presentense, that is to saye, for the tyme that is now
                  •
                present, of the delyueryng of the Lordes bodye and of the sheddyng foorth of his bloud: that same dooe thei expoune by the preter tense, that is to saye, for the time past. After all this, we ferther consider that they can not lacke tropes in the consecratyng of the sacrament, for this woorde, Est, is, they take for conuertitur, is chaunged, or transubstanciatur, is transubstanciated or chaunged insubstaunce, or els forfyt is made. And forasmuche as Christ did institute it as a sacrament, and for a sacrament it is conuenient that the signes be taken accordinge to their significacions and betokenynges of the thyng, and that they bee taken as figuratly spoken accordyng to the nature of a sacrament, whiche is, that it be a signe. We haue also a respecte to the ascension of Christe into heauen, and to the veritee and trueth of his humayne nature whiche he toke here vpon hym, and also to that that is conteyned in. S. Iohns ghospell whan it is sayed to the Capernaites: My woordes are spirite and lyfe, the

fleashe profiteth nothyng, (as in dede true it is, if it bee carnally and fleashly eaten:) the spirite it is, that geueth lyfe: And agayne we consider Paule who in this place to the Corinthians doeth in moste playne woordes, put the terme of Breade, where neuerthelesse these men will nedes haue that there is a trope and a figure, thoughe they so greatlye abhorre that in the other place of oures there shoulde bee anye trope. We heare also Paule hymselfe witnessing that the auncient fathers of the olde testament had the veray selfe same sacramentes that we nowe haue. For, as Austen recordeth, he thoughte it not enoughe that thei had spirituall meate and drinke, but he also added, cundem, that is to saye, the veray same. And agayne because thou shouldest, not doubte but that Paule mēte that theyr sacramētes and ours are al one, he expressed baptisme by name, whiche baptisme he sayeth the fathers atteigned and had in the sea and in the cloude. Wherof it is euident that the saied fathers of the olde lawe had theyr sacramentes not onely emonge themselues, but also that thei had the veraye same that we haue. We see also that other sayinges of the scripture beeyng veraye nere and muche lyke vnto this saying that we traicte of, are euen of these our aduersaries taken as woordes figurately spoken. For it is thus expressed: The breade whiche we breake, is the Communion or partakynge of Christes bodye. And, this cuppe is the newe testamente. &c. which woordes we haue now somwhat often rehearsed. Besides all this, it dooeth not

properly agree nor accorde to the bodye of Christ for to bee eaten.
            And of the premisses it is open at ful and manifest, what ought to bee sayed to the secound argumēt or reasō of the transubstanciatours, in whiche thei obiected against vs, that a sentence or clause in scripture ought not to be taken after any trope or figure, except there were some thyng conteyned either afore, or comyng after in the same sentence whiche did aduise and iustly moue vs that it wer so to bee dooen.
            And thei went ferther with vs also, allegynge that wher Christ saieth: this is my body, that shalbe geuen vp for you, we did take the latter part of this sentence in the bare and propre sence of ye wordes wtout any chaunge or alteracion which thyng is manifestlye false, for so muche as we there chaūge the tymes, and do not admitte or take it to be the same bodye whiche was betrayed and geuen vppe to death for vs. For that bodye was not alonelye visible but also passible. Neyther can there be in one and the same substaunce or subiecte at one and the same tyme the properties and qualities of a bodye corruptible together with the gyftes and properties of a bodye glorifyed: so that one and thesame body at one instaūt tyme should bee bothe passible and not passible. And besydes this we haue nowe alreadye showed what other places caused vs to admitte the figures afore spoken of and declared, that is to wete, Synecdoche and Metonimia where the thynge instituted is takē for the auctoure, that is to saye, for hym that dyd institute it.
            
               Nowe will we make aunswere to the argumēt which is the thyrde ceason alleged in the beginnyng of this booke for the establishyng of transubstanciacion:An answer to the third argumente that was made for transubstā
                  ciacion, and the argumente is concernyng thynges of dyuerse and contrary natures whiche are called of the Logicians in the schoole terme disparata as is afore sayed, whiche are so vnlyke (saye they) and so disseuered one from another, that the one of them can not be sayed nor verifyed of the other. Whereunto we aunswere, that suche thynges as of themselues are in suche sorte dyuerse, & vnlyke, and disseuered or contrary of nature and kinde the one to the other: yet yf they bee well ioigned together wel applyed and proporcioned ye one to the other for the better signifying and expressinge of a thynge, they maye nowe in suche case bee so ioygned together that they will make a good proposicion and a perfecte sentence. Whiche thing we see to haue been dooen not onely of Christe where he sayeth, The seed is the worde of God & in another place, I am a vine tre: but also of Paule where he saieth, that we all are one breade, & in another place, the breade whiche we breake is the partakyng and cōmunion of the body of Christ: and agayn: this cup is the new testamēt in my blud. Nor we do not muche passe on yt that some saie, that Mathew & Mark did in plain & expresse wordes say, this is my bloud of the new testamēt. &c. for we deny not but y• these Euangelistes did so write, but in the meane tyme we stifly hold & saye yt the wordes which Luke and Paule haue writen, are to bee receaued

and allowed too, aswell as the others. And those woordes of Luke and Paule we affirme (as we haue saied of the other sentences) that thei are made of wordes so ferre disagreyng and disseuered in theyr natures that they maye after the sayd schoole terme of the Logiciās be but wel called disparata: but yet in the way of signifying and for the better expressing of the mattier that is ment and entended by theim, they bee veraye aptly ioygned and knitte together and do veraye well accorde.
            In another argument it was sayed, yt when Christe spake these wordes,An answere to y• fourth argumente that was alleged for transubstanciacion. This is my body, he sayed not this signifieth or represēteth my body, this bread is a figur or signe of my body. &c. To this we answer & lay again for vs, yt likewise Christ neuer sayed yt his body laye lurkyng and hidden vnder those accidentes without a subiecte (as the transubstanciacioners doe imagyn,) nor Christ did neuer saye that the substance and matier of the bread dooeth cease to bee there in the sacrament or that it was chaunged and turned by any kinde of transubstanciation into the substaunce of his body, and thē ferther I do muche meruaile how men can obiecte those thynges in this wyse against vs, seyng that these exposicions that it be taken in that sence are moste playnelye conteyned and expressed in the fathers and auncient writers of the churche. For they haue veray often in their bookes and writynges these mannier of speakynges the body and bloud of Christ to be represented, to be signifyed, to bee poynted, to bee betokeneded, and to bee shewed.
            
               And the signes of breade and wyne they doe calle by these termes, the seale, the figure, & the pype or paterne, and the counterpaine of the true and veray thyng it selfe. Neither is ther any cause why any man maye cauill and obiecte that the fathers did referre and applye in these signes or figures to the death of Christe, and 
                  •
               ot to the body of Christe. For the fathers dooe moste playnlye in theyr bookes wryte, and saye, that the bodye and bloude of Christe is signifyed & betokened in the sacramente. And that we haue the signes and figures geuen vs of the verai bodye and bloude of Christe.

               Bartram also wryteth in this manner: by laying & applying the testimonies of ye holy scriptures and the sayinges of the fathers together, it is most euidentlye proued and declared, that the breade whiche is called the bodye of Christe, and the cuppe whiche is called the bloud of Christe, is a figure: because it is a mysterie, & hath a further thyng hyd vnder it.

He admitted Iudas to hys maūdye, in the which he gaue & cōmaūded vnto his disciples a figure of his body. The same mā against Maximinus in the .iii. boke, & .xxii. chap. sayeth thus.

By these places yu perceiuest & seest, y• the fathers and aūcient wryters, do not abhorre to put a signification of the body of Christ in this sacramēt but do playnly put, yt there is a significatiō of Christes body in the sacramēt.

Wher fore thys argument is playn blanke, & is brought to nought. Therefore whā they obiect y• Christ dyd not say, yt it did eyther signifie, or represent hys body: we make answere, yt yet neuertheles euen out of the scriptures it may so be taken, & that haue we proued lately inough before. Neither do we as (they thynke) reason or argue after thys maner & sort. Thyskind & maner of speking is so takē in other places, & therfore it ought so to be taken here. But we only make answere to thē, who when they should proue their transubstanciatiō they brynge for their purpose thys texte.

But I wonder muche, howe they be come thus so dainely so reuerent obseruers of the true worshyppinge: seynge yt in other matters, both wood and pictures and images be worshipped among thē and prayed vnto. But peraduenture, they will saye, they worship not the stockes or pictures, but the thinges selues which are represēted therby. But why wil they not graūt ye same thinges of ye bread if it remain in y• sacramēt, y• it shal not be worshipped it selfe, but those things which ye same bread doth note & signifie. Thā further (I prai you) whi did they by ye like reasō reproue & take a wai the accidētes also, lest peraduē
               ture ye same accidētes might apere to be worshiped & praied to in ye sacramēt

                  •
                & images which thei stil suffer & worship in their churches are nothinge but accidentes, nether before which thei bow & knele down to worship thē.

For and if they longed to do worshyppe to the substaunce of woode or of stone, and not to the accidētes they mighte fynde euery where in the woodes, and in the streates store inoughe of stockes & stones to worshyppe and praye vnto.
            Further, the plaine, and rude and ignoraunt people haue no suche learnynge nor knoweledge that they can iudge nor discerne, or put anye difference betwene the schole termes of Accidentes, and Substaunce. And these men that feygne theim selues to be moued wyth suche greate and hole zeale in thys matter for auoydinge thys Idolatrie, should haue done very well to haue made a transubstantiation of the cuppe selfe too, leste peraduenture the cuppe myght chaunce to be worshypped, and prayed vnto, whan it is lifted vp aboue the priestes heade, & shewed. And truly thys argumente hath euer semed vnto me, a veray slender & a vayn argumēt, though in dede it be obiected of schole doctours, yea, and such schoole doctours as be of no small name.
            
               The fift reason auoided that was made for trā
                  substāciatiō
               It was further argued agaynste vs, that except we graunte and put a traunsubstantiation, there shal in thys sacramente two natures or substaūces of bodilye quantitye be putte togyther, at one tyme, and in one place. Who woulde not maruaile to see these men to be of suche holines, and confidence towardes ladye Nature, and of such hygh reuerence, as though they woulde not by theyr wylles in anye poynt breake or violate hyr lawes. Where as yet they wilnedes haue certayne accidentes to hange by them selues, and to be without anye subiecte of materiall substaunce, which thinge is most of all others contrarye to the course, &

lawes, and ordre of nature, and yet neuertheles they do not by this their folishe deuise and imagination escape or auoyde the inconuenience whiche they mooste feare.
            For whan they leaue the accidentes remaynynge there is of necessitie a bodye emiddes the same accidentes, whyche body vndoubtedlye perteyneth to quantitie, and can not be withoute a quantitie and bignes, and doeth without doubte, fill a rowme and a place.
            And where they will neades haue that the fleshe of Christe is bodily there presente wythal, whych bodye of Christe hath also a quantitie and bygnesse and that the sayde bodie of Christe muste lye there, as a thinge hydden vnder the accidentes, they can not chose but remediles consounde and mengle togither sondry thynges of quantitye, and do mengle togither two bodies, hauynge their seuerell quantities

               ation that we shall putte in thys matter, there is no daunger nor perill of anye suche folyshe and vnreasonable inconuenience.The auoydinge of the seuenth reason brought in to confi
                     •
                  me & establishe transubstantiation. They sayde further, that it was not semynge nor fitte for the dignitie of Christe, that hys body should be ioygned and annexed to the substaūce of breade, whiche is a verye fonde, and a folyshe try flynge opinion.
            For wee dooe not saye, that there is made one essensuall thynge of the bodye of Christe, and of nature of the bread (in such sort as of the diuine nature, & the humayne nature in Christ ther is made one person nor we can not perceiue, what greater dignitie, or hygher prerogatiue there should be in the accidentes, thē ther is in the bread. So that if the body of Christ

shoulde be put to be in the sacramentes wyth the accidentes (as they would haue it) we see no cause or reason whye the same bodye of Christe may not euen as wel stand togyther and remayne with the substaunce and nature of breade.
            And for as muche as the diuine nature of Christe, is sayed and affirmed to be euen in hell by hys power, without any losse or derogation of hys dignitye, and for as muche as thys same bodye of Christ (as them selues thyncke and holde) is geuen trulye, and substā
               ciallye to the wicked sorte also to be receiued and eaten of theym, beinge men mooste corrupte and moste vnworthy to receyue it.
            Whye dooe they so greatelye feare the dymynishynge of hys dignytye in case it so were, that the bodye and bloude of Christe shoulde be ioygned to the breade and wyne, speciallye seynge that the ioygninge and knittynge togyther for a signification or betokenynge of the thinge, ought to be putte, and appoynted therein.

                  •
                sayeth: that it is the passion of Christe that wee offer vppe at the Lordes Supper.
            
               And who is so rude, so grosse, or so ignoraunt, that he doeth not knowe the passion of Christe, not to be nowe presente in the handes of the minister, for as muche, as it was a thynge done and paste long sence. Wherof there is at this supper a memoriall celebrabrated and kepte, and thanckes are geuen to God for the same.
            But all that euer they laye for theym selues as a cloke in thys argument, is but a thyng feigned and a veraye lye, by the whyche they deuise and imagine the very sonne of God trulye, and substanciallye, and veraylye to be sacrificed and offered vp to the father by the priest and minister.
            In whyche matter howe wyde they are, & howe farre they swerue from the trueth, there is no place at thys presente tyme to shewe.

And so maye it be very well, bicause of the greate likenes and similitude whiche is betwene the sayde thinges, and the sygnes, by reason of Gods institution or ordinaunce in them.

               The fathers do alwayes call this a spirituall foode, & not a bodilye foode.An other rule is, that if ye diligently marke what wente before, and what comm

                  •
                that the fathers do witnes and testifye, the foode of this sacramēt to be a spiritual foode and not the foode of the gutte, or of the bealye, or of the teethe.
            
               The thirde rule how to vnderstand the doctors.The thyrd rule is, that if at any tyme thei do write that we do communicate carnally and fleashlye with Christe, so that our verai bodyes also are fed with the hoste and sacramente of Eucharistia: all this is in this

wyse to be vnderstanded, that we must cōceyue in our myndes, that the sonne of God whan he was conceiued of the virgyn Marie, and didde take the nature of man vpon him: did euen than f
                  •
               eash
                  •
               ly and naturally communicate with vs.
            And ferthermore we dooe than abyde in hym, and he againe abydeth in vs, whan we beleue the woordes that he hath spoken, and whan with a true feythe we receyue the sacramentes. For in communicatyng and receyuyng his bodye after this sorte, there is geuen and wrought in vs a new spiritie, and our f
                  •
               eashe and bodyes whiche before were of lyke nature with Christe, and now made partakers all of lyke propretees and qualitees with him, & become apte to receiue his immortalitie, and his resurreccion. And whā they obey & serue y• spirite: than are thei truly & verely nourished vnto life euerlastyng. And thus our bodyes by receyuyng of this sacramente are fed two mannier of wayes: the one, with the outwarde signe and figure: and the other, by this restoryng of vs to euerlastynge lyfe: and so is Christe sayed to remayne and abyde in vs by meanes of this sacramente. And as touchynge the fyrste kynde, of communicatynge whiche we haue with Christ by his natiuitee and incarnatiō we haue a testimonie therof out of the Epistle of Paule to the Hebrewes, in the seconde chapitur, in these woordes: For asmuche than as the childrē are partakers of fleashe and bloud, he also hath lykewyse been partaker with the same.
            Now that to this presente purpose, it is ferther to bee considered, that the word of consecrating doeth

signifie nothing els with the fathers and old writers, but to dedicate & appoint yt thing now to some holy vse and offyce, whiche before was prophan and common of his owne nature. And therfore we must not as often as we reade in the fathers this woorde or terme of consecration by an by imagyn in our braynes a transubstanciacion:How the auncient fathers dooe take and vse the word or terme of cō
                  sec
                     •
                  ating or consecraciō
                And yet y• there is a certain chaung & a mutation in the consecration, we dooe not denye, that is to wete, suche a chaunge, for whiche these same thynges are now made sacramentes, to signifie vnto vs effectually, that (as concerning our mynde, or solle and oure feith,) the veray body and bloude of Christe is geuen and offred by the power of the holy ghoste.
            It is ferther to bee knowen, that as touchyng the thynges selues, there is no difference betwene vs and the Caper
                  •
               aites. For they thought that they shoulde haue eaten the veraye bodye and the veraye fleashe of Christe: and we dooe graunte no lesse to bee dooen in the sacrament of the Lordes supper.
            
               The differēce betwen vs and the Capernaites in receyuyng the sacramentes.But the difference betwene the Capernaites and vs, resteth in the mannier and fashion of eatynge it. For the same that they thoughte shoulde be carnallye and fleashly dooen: we teache to bee doen spiritually. And the veray true body of Christ and his veray true bloud it is that is geuen. For feith doeth not embrace nor receiue feigned thinges, but thinges y• are true in dede. Also whan it is red in ye writynges of ye fathers the body of Christ to be cōprehēded & cōteined in these misteries: there is nothing els to be takē or vnderstād by these wordes, but that it is limited, noted, shewed, represented, or signified by them.

Who neuertheles would not haue denied, but that the bodye and fleashe doth noye & burden, & encumber the soule, & that the same body & fleshe oughte to be bridled and kepte vnder. For the same Paule in an other place writeth in thys maner. The fleashe desyereth contrarye to the spirite.
            Neither was Paule ignoraunt that there be many ill folke, which in the scripture be called fleshe & bloud, of whom neuertheles we be molested and vered, & haue a continual conflicte or wresting with the same. But Paules menyng was of that same chiefe and especiall cont

also in another place, that there is in Christe neither he nor she neither bondeman nor free man. &c. Yet neuerthelesse these offices and these sortes of people are not reiected or put awaye from Christe, or from the congregacion of Christians, yea and commaundementes and rules of ordre wrytten in scripture seuerally of the sayde sortes of people. But Paule ment that these thynges be not in Christe as touchyng regeneracion in Christ, as touching forgeuenesse of synnes, and as touchyng the obteynynge of euerlastyng lyfe, which thynges are the highest and chiefest pointes in the profession of Christe. And in distributing of ye sayd thinges. Christ hath not any parciall respecte to these states & to these degrees of men. The same Apostle wryteth these woordes: The kyngdome of God is not in woordes: and yet he would not for that cause bannyshe out of the congrega

            And in this sence or meanyng the Apostle sayd that Christe was crucified euen before the eyes of the Galathians.The presence that feith causeth. And after the same manier was Abraham sayed to haue sene the daye of the Lorde. And after thesame manier the olde aunciente fathers of the olde testament had the same Christe in theyr sacramentes, that we haue nowe in ours.

For he wryteth, yt

And he did nat saie, that it is made of the accidētes of an yearthely thynge, and after wardes he wryteth our bodyes receyuyng the sacramente of Eucharistia, to bee on thys condicion not corruptible, if the same haue hope of resurrection. And in case that so great a chaunge bee graunted and putte of hym to bee in oure bodyes, that he made it equal with the chaunge of the breade: (for as that breade (sayeth he) is no longer Cōmon bread so our bodies be no longer corruptible) what nede shall it be, to sette vp thys transubstanciatyon, seyng he maketh the twoo chaungeynges on bothe sydes equall.

               The obiection out of Origen aunswered vnto.They brought in agaynst vs Origen also, because he wrote that Christe graunted the breade to bee his bodye. And that dooe not we denye: but all oure controuersie dooeth consiste in the manier how it is Christes bodye. And as touchyng this poynte, Origen hymself sheweth playnly in other places of his weorkes, that there be figures here, and that this bread is called the word nutritiue of the solle, and geueth a ferther lesson concernyng thesame, that we muste not set our myndes to cleue and sticke, to the bloude of the fleashe, but to the bloud of the worde.
            
               Cyprian answered vnto.
               Ciprian semeth to speake more hardelye, when he sayed that this breade is chaunged, not in his shape, or outwarde apparaunce, but in his nature. But we muste haue a regard and consideracion what he wrote to Caecisius. Whiche was, that the Lordes bloude was shewed foorth with the wyne, and that if wine ceassed to bee in the cuppe, it coulde not seme that Christes bloud was in the cup. And as touchyng that he writeth in this place of chaungeyng the wyne into bloud, we graunted also that a chaunge there is, but we affirme it to bee a sacramentall mutacion or chaunging & none other. And thus takyng it we graunt that it is not ye shape of ye bread, or ye fourme, or ye accidentes of the breade that haue suche office here as to be Sacramentes: but we saye that the nature, and the veraye substaunce of the breade and of the wyne is chaunged into the sacramētes of Christes body and bloud. And And as the veray substaunce of the bread and not the shape of the breade dooeth nourishe: so Christes body dooeth bothe nourishe our soule and bringeth coū
               forte and strengthe to our bodye.
            
               And as the very substaunce of the breade is made of many graynes: so the mystical bodye whiche it representeth, hath many members or partes ioyned and vnited together. Wherfore as well we as oure aduersaries, dooe graunte that it is not the shape, that is to saye, the outwarde apparence and sight of the bread and the outwarde fashion of it, that is chaunged: but that it is the veray substaunce therof, whiche is chaū
               ged. Now our aduersaries will haue, that the chan̄ge is made by the castyng awaye of the breades nature but we doe holde, that there is but onely a sacramentall chaunge.
            And Cyprian himselfe maketh playnly agaynste our aduersaries. For they dooe not saie, that the substaunce of the breade is chaunged: but they saye, that the substaunce of the breade is vtterly gone, so that they take the bread cleane awaye. We saye, that the substaunce of the breade is chaunged, and so chaunged, that it becometh Christes bodye: that is to saye, the sacrament of Christes body: which it was not before. A man maye also besides all this, saye, that this latine woorde natura is not euermore in the good auctoures of the latine tongue taken for substancia that is to saye, substaunce: but sometymes it is taken for one of these woordes, vis the strength or vertue, ingenium the nature or disposicion, or propri
                     •
                  tas, the propretee. &c. Whereof Cicero saieth in his booke entitled Desomnio scipionis: The propre nature and strength of the solle is (sayeth he,) that it is moued of it selfe. And in an epistle to one Lentulus he writeth thus: The nature & the religion of thy prouince to be suche &c.

In whyche place the worde nature is taken for the fasshion, and the disposicion or inclinacyon. &c. And euen in lyke manier is it to bee taken whan it is saied: the nature of herbes, or the nature of stones, and so others like. And thys sygnification of the worde nature, dooeth veraie well agree with the saieyng of Ciprian afore cited.

                  nto.They bring foorth Ambrose agaynste vs also, and specyallye in his Bookes entitled de sacramentis. Whyche bookes Ambrose dyd not make, as som men thynke. Fysher late bishoppe of Rochester dooeth inueighe & in maner rage agaynst al suche as so thinke. And he sayeth, that we ought in any wyse to geue credite vnto Austen, who auoucheth that Ambrose wrote the sayed bookes, and was Auctour of theim, and he testyfyeth in plaine woordes, that Ambrose wrote these said bookes of the sacramentes. And for proufe of the mattyer, he allegeth the prologue of Austē vpon hys bookes entitled de doctrina Christiana which prologue of Austen. I haue often tymes reade. But yet cold I neuer ther fynd that, that fysher wrytteth: vnlesse paraduenture he meane of that that Austen wroote in his boke of Retractacyons, whan he maketh mencion of his bookes de doctrina Christiana and ther in dede, he saith suche a thyng, but not in ye prologe of hys work de doctrine Christiana, as fysher citeth it. Morouer thys pointe I doe verai wel know, that Austen wrytynge agaynste one. Iulianus a pelagion dooeth allege Ambrose concernyng the Sacramente of rege neracyon or of philosophye: But he mencyoneth not any woorde of these bookes of the misteries or of the sacramētes. And ye wordes yt Austē al
                  •
               egeth in yt place

are not in these bookes of the sacramentes. But I passe not for thys. Suppose that Ambrose were the autour and wryter of them: they dooe not vtterly dissente or disagree from oure myndes in this mattier.
            For many thynges he speaketh of sygnyfyeng, and that these sacramentes bee called, or sayd to bee Christes bodye: whyche thynges we dooe not denye. And in case he dooe at any tyme speake or make mencion of chaūging or turnyng: thā is it all together to be vnderstāded of a sacramental chaungeyng. Morouer he himselfe must be wel loked vpon & weyghed, what he writeth in other places. Fyrst de officiis in the fourth booke and fowertie eight chapitur, he hath these wordes here ensuyng: In the one, that is to saye, in the old lawe, is the shadowe: and in the one is the ymage: but in the other, that is to saye, in the newe lawe, is the veritee, in the law is the shadowe: in the ghospell is the trueth, and trueth there is in heauenly thynges. In the olde lawe, there was offred a lambe, there was offred a calfe: nowe in the newe lawe is Christe offered, but he is offered as a man, and as one that receiueth his passion, but he himselfe offrethe himself as a priest, that he maye putte awaye our synnes: here as if wer in an Image or similitude, there in veritee, where he maketh intercessyon as an Aduocate for vs before hys father. And vpon the fyrste epistle to the Corynthyens, (as we haue before alleged) the same Ambrose thus sayeth: In eatynge and drinkynge we dooe represente or sygnyfye the fleashe and bloude of Chryste, whyche thynges bee offred.

And whan he speaketh of the bloud, he saieth, that we receiue the misticall cuppe, in tipum 
                     •
                  ius, that is to saye, for a sygne of he same bloud.
            Also the same ambrose in his fourth boke of the sacramentes, and the fourth chapytur, putteth plainly our chaungeynge into Christe: whyche selfe same pointe we haue noted & marked oftentimes in others of the olde fathers, and wryters.
            Now remayneth that we see concerning Chrisostome, what is to bee saied:Chrisostom aunswered v

                  to. They brought in for their purpose hys similitude of waxe, whyche waxe beeyng put to the fyer, is distroyed as touchyng his substaunce, so that nothyng of the waxe remayneth or eskapeth: So thynke thou (saieth Chrysostome) that the mysteryes are cōsumed of the substaunce of Christes bodye. Our aduersaryes saye: What thing can be spoken more plainly to declare that the substaunce of ye bread is gon? but here I thinke it no labour loste but a profytable excercyse to examin dyligently some places o

                Chrysostomes weorkes, that ye maye vnderstande plainly, how wel the thynges be marked which we spake of before: as touchyng such phrases founde in olde wryters. In the .lxxxiii. homelye vpon Matth. he wrytteth thus: Many men say, that they wisshe and wolde fayn see the fourme, and shape and likenes of Christ: yea and that they would veraye fayne beholde his garmentes and shooes: but he deliuereth himselfe to thee, not onely that thou mayest see hym, but also that thou maist touche hym Doe not we here vnderstande, how he appli

               th that to the thyng of the sacrament, which belongeth or pertayneth to the sygnes, as for example Chrystes

bodye maye bee touched, and maye bee seen? whiche thing to bee true of the signes onelye: what it is that doeth not receiue and see. Again, in the same homelie or exhortaciō: Christ reduceth and bringeth vs with him selfe into one masse or lumpe, and that not onely by fayth: but also he maketh vs in veray dede his bodye. Whiche same selfe thinge also he wrote in the sixtieth and sixtieth one Homelie, vnto the people of Antioche: affyrmyng that we, not onelye by faithe and charitee: but in veray dede: are made and are ioyned and anexed to Christes body. And if it so be, that our substaūce is not turned into Christes substaunce, and yet that we bee so nyghe to Christe: why muste the substaunce of the breade bee chaunged whan it muste bee made Christes body. But a doubt mighte here arise, as though Chrisostome made against vs, in that we holde that this receyuynge is by feythe, where he sayeth, that we be ioyned and turned or chaunged in to Christe, not onely through feyth, but also in veraye dede. But here is to bee marked, that althoughe we holde Christes bodye to be eaten, and his bloud to be drounke through feith in receyuing of this sacrament yet vpon this receyuyng by feyth there doeth foorthe with folowe not a feyned ioygning but a true and an effectuall couplyng betwene vs and Christe, through the whiche ioygning of vs to Christe not onelye oure mynde and solle is vnited and knitte vnto Christe and made one with hym: but also oure body and our flesh hath therby a certayne restoryng and renewyng, so that we are therby truly and verayly made the members of the Lorde, and we receyue Christe whiche is

               d our life continually. And this it is that Chrisostome ment whan he said that we be truely and veraily ioigned to Christ. And thus muche more maie yet be said herein, that Chrisostome in the selfe same homelie and sermon vpon Mathew saieth, that th

                     •
                  e, which is: whan a man for ye more vehemēt and more earnest expressing of a thing will speake more then the trueth is, or maye withoute playne myracle as for exaumple if one shoulde saye, that al the world heard a thyng spokē, whan his meaning is, that a veray great noumber heard it: this manier of speakyng is called hiper bole, and in his homelye made in Eucherius, he sayeth that in the cuppe there is

bloud taken out euen from the lordes syde.
            Whiche thyng can not be beleued in the verai same fourme that it is spoken,Chrisostome himselfe declareth his owne hyperblicall speakynges. forasmuche as Christes side is not nowe at this daye open, neither any bloud takē out therefrom.
            He wrytethe morouer in thesame Homelie after this manier: Doest thou see any bread or wyne? And hymselfe in this wyse maketh the au
                  •
               swere to the question: Nay, god forbyd. Surely yf he should aske the sences of a manne suche a question, they woulde aunswere (yf thei could speake,) that it wer not true that Chrisostome sayeth. For after the iudgemente of oure senses, there is present bothe bread and wyne too. But he speaketh truly whan he sayeth afterwardes, non ita cogites, that is, thinke no suche thinge in thy mynde, that there is breade there. For as touchyng our mynde or thynkynge, all suche thinges must awaye.
            Thesame Chrisostome wryteth in this mannier: Ne putes te ex homine accipere corpus Christi sed a seraphin, qui astet et forcipe tradat tibi Carbonem ignitum. That is to saye, think not thy self to receyue the bodye of Christ at a mortall mannes hand: but of an Aungel of the ordre of Seraphin who standeth by, and deliuereth thee an hoate fierye coale with a payre of tongues
                  •
                &c. here in this place I dooe not suppose that these men wolde haue that the minister or the pastour whiche ministreth the Sacramentes vnto vs, is transubstanciated into an Aungell. And thesame Chrisostome writeth afterwardes. Accurramus ad exugendum sanguinem, qui ex latere domini prof
                     •

The veray schoolemenne themselues dare not speake so large as this. For they wryte yt the bread and the wyne are turned into the substaunce of the bodye and bloude of Christe: but yet not so that anye thynge is added to the veraye true substaunce of Christes body or abated from the substaunce of the same. And in the lx. and one homelie to the people of Antioche, he saith that Christe did not geue hymselfe to vs to bee seen, but also to bee touched, and to bee felte, & to haue his fleashe fastened vpon with our teeth. In whiche place also, ye see that that is applyed to the thing signified by the sacramentes,That that properly belo

                  es as attributed to the thynges. whiche properlye and peculierlye belongeth but to the sygnes onely. For our teeth doe not reache so fer, as to touche ye substaunce of Christes bodye, but onely to the breade, and the signes, and the Sacramentes,
            The same manne in the sixtieth Homelye to the people of Antioche sayeth that we oughte not to thynke yt the ministers hande doeth holde foorthe the Sacramente vnto vs: but that we shoulde thynke Christes owne hande to bee stretched foorthe vnto vs and to dooe it. And likewyse in Baptisme that it is Christe himselfe that executeth the office of baptising. And in the three skore & one Homelie he exhortethe vs to thynke that we dooe in this Sacramente taste Christe sittinge in heauen
                  •
                whiche is wurshipped of the Aungels. In all whiche whiche places here nowe alleged it is manifest and playne enough that this our olde aunciente father trauayled by all meanes possible to call foorthe the myndes of suche as receyue the Sacramentes from these yearthly and grosse and outward signes, to the contemplacion

and meditacion of the godly and heauenlye thynges by them represented. And a thing it is much to be meruayled at, that these men whiche bee so diligent in serching and discussynng the sayinges of the fathers and olde wryters: Dooe not emong all others, bring forthe the place of Chrisostome whiche is wryten in the sixtieth and one Homely to the people of Antioche where he sayeth, that those men are bothe lighte and malaperte and frowarde whiche vse to stande present by, at the ministryng of the sacramentes, and doe not receue the communion themselues to. Wherin Chrysostome affirmeth yt they doe vnto Christ a manifest iniurye and wrong. But to tarye a lytle longer vpon that that was set foorth in the argumente of weaxe whyche melteth altogether whan it is sette to ye fyer (as aforesayd) we aunswere, that Chrisostome hath often tymes in that place thys woorde Puta, that is, thinke thou, to thentente we shoule vnderstād that thys and suche other mattyers muste not bee taken but onely in respecte of our feyth and our thinking, with the whiche feith or thynkyng whan we receiue the breade and the wyne, we dooe not comprehē
               or consider the bare thinges alone by themselfes: But we lyfte vp our myndes, & seke the heauenlye thynges whyche by waye of betokeninge are annexed to those yearthely thynges,Cirillus answered vnto and declared. and by the same effectually signified. Morouer we bryng forth a lyke symilitude out of Cyrilus in the tenth boke and the .xiii. chapitur vpon the gospel of Ihon where he saith yt waxe being melted & so mingled with other waxe yt bothe be made vtterly one thīg doeth represente ye verai same thīg yt is doē ī ye receiuīg of ye sacramēt: which is, yt we be made

verayly one thyng with Christ.
            And the same selfe thynge he hath agayne in the fowerth booke a
                  •
               d seuenteenth chapytur of the same woorke.
            Nowe than if it so bee that thys symilytude of weaxe hath place as touchinge that we bee made one wyth Christe, and yet no transubstanciatynge of oure bodye thereunto required: than maye the same thynge also bee putte and holden of Chrysostomes similitude whyche he putteth betwene the weaxe and the sygnes or mysteryes of thys sacramente. Besydes the premisses, it is to bee demaunded of oure aduersaryes whether they wyll haue these and suche other similitudes to agree in all poyntes.
            Whyche thynge if they graunte to bee true, than shoulde they take awaye also the whytnesse, the roundenesse, ye taste, and the other accidentes of the breade from this sacramente. For the weaxe that is put to the fyer is not onely destroyed as touchynge the substaunce of it but also as touchynge the accidentes. If they wyll not the simylitude to haue place in thys behalfe, than shal it belefull and free for vs also, to vnderstande all thys whole mattier, and to applye it to the thynkynge and conceiuynge of oure mindes, and to that that is comprehended and enbraced by feith: and there wyl we graunte as touchynge the conceyuynge or comprehensyon of oure feyth that the nature bothe of bread and wyne departeth awaie, and that oure mynde and solle is onelye fyxed vpon the thynges that are thereby sygnyfyed, and vpon the thynges whyche are offred vnto vs by meane of that outewarde sygnes, that is to saie, vpon the

bodye and bloud of Chryste.
            And as touchynge Chrysostome, thus muche suffiseth to bee sayde: wherin we maye well see howe trulye those thynges whiche we haue spoken before of vnderstandinge and takynge the olde fathers and auncient wryters of the churche dooe take place.Austen aunswred vnto.
            
            Then was Austens sayinge brought in and obiected agaynste vs, for that he wrote vpon the three and thirtieth Psalme, that Christe dyd beare himselfe in his owne handes:Christ howe he bare hym self in his own handes yea euen at his last supper whan he distributed and deliuered the sacrament aboute to his Apostles: and as for this, dooe not we denye. For what impediment or lette should there bee, but that Christe might beare his owne body in his owne handes yf by his bodye a man vnderstande the Sacrament of his bodye. And this it meneth that Austen did adde in the ende of this place, this worde Quodammodo that is to saye after a certayne fashion, as though he shoulde haue sayed, he bare not himselfe after a playne and absolute manier of speakynge or vnderderdandyng, but aliquo modo that is, after a certayne fashion, and that is the same veraye waye or fasshion whyche we haue here aboue alreadye declared.
            They laye agaynste vs also thesame Austens sayinge written in the thyrd booke De Trinitate, that is to saye of Trinitie where he sayeth that the breade is broughte to his visible lykenesse of fashion by the handye woorke of manne, but that it could bee made so greate a Sacramente withoute the inuisible operacion and woorkynge of the holy ghoste.
            But it is a matier not alitle to be wondered at, howe these mē cā not cal to remēbraūce nor receiue no other

worke of the holy ghoste in this sacramente, but transubstaunciation onely. For as soone as they heare the name and mencion of operatyon of the holy ghoste in thys sacramente they can streight waie bring in transubstanciacyon whereas yet neuerthelesse these outwarde signes can not possybly be so chaunged, yt they can bee brought to suche an high state and degree as to bee sacramentes,It is the operation of the holye ghoste that these helementes are made sac
                     •
                  amentes. nor cannot bee chaunged. But by the power and might of God, yt is to wete, through the lordes institutyon and ordinaunce by pronouncyng of certain holy wordes out of the sciptures, and by the strength and efficacye of the holy ghostes workyng: For these godly thynges dooe not nowe any more come hurlyng or stumblyng into oure myndes after the vulgare or commen sorte: But wyth an effectuall and a veray earneste enforcemente of the holy ghoste. And by the strength and vertue of the same holy ghost, our hartes & myndes be persuaded and moued to the conceauyng and enbracyng of the thinges of the sacramentes throughe feith.
            Nowe as touchynge Austens saying who in the nyntie eighte psalme vpon the texte Adorate scabellum pedem eius that is, wurshyp ye the foote stoole of hys feete, seketh about what footestole the same should bee, and at lengthe fyndeth that it is sayed in the scriptures Terra est scabellum pedum eius that is to say the yearthe is hys foote stoole butte howe (sayeth he (shall we wurshyp the yearthe: It is not wryten in the scryptures, Thou shalt wurshyp the lorde thy god, & him alone shalt thou serue, and is it not commaunded (sayeth Austen) that we shall not wurshyp any of the thynges whiche are in ye heauens

aboue, or vpon the yearth beneath, or in the waters, or vnderneathe the yearth. But after al thys he bryngeth in, that a certain yearth there is, whyche bothe maie and oughte of good right to bee wurshypped, For (saieth he) the soonne of god tooke vpon hym mannes nature, that is to saie, 
                  •
               leashe of a virgyn, and fleashe is called yearth in the holy scryptures, because oure bodye was taken of the yearth. And that the fleashe of Christe is to bee wurshypped, dooeth of thys mattyer plainly appere, because that whan he geueth the same to bee eaten, no man dooeth eate it before he hath first wurshipped it.
            These woordes of Austen can make no thynge againste vs. For we make no denyall at all but that the fleashe of Chryste is to be wurshipped, because of the ioygninge and couplyng that it hath wyth hys other nature of hys Godhed. But nowe at thys present our contencion is, whether the said fleshe of Christ lyeth hidden in the sacramente vnder the accydentes of the breade, and not whether the fleashe of Chryste bee to bee wurshipped or no. But they saie. If Christes fleashe were not there in the sacramente, and breade still remayninge or conteyned in the sacramente: than shoulde there bee Idolatrie comitted. But we thus aunswer agayn, that they also renne into as greate a daungier of Idolatrie, as we. For they also on there parte shoulde remoue and take awaye the accidentes, leste the same accidentes might happen to be wurshipped: and they shoulde chaunge the substaunce of the veraye cuppe or chalice too, and make a transubstanciacion of it for feare leste it woulde bee wurshypped of some ignoraunte persones, and Idolatrie cōmyted therunto.
            
               But in a sacramente we putte a dyfference betwene the outwarde signes and the thynges that are sygnyfied by theim: and to these sygnes we geue and shewe honour and reuerence that is to wete, that thei bee reuerently handled and after a comely facion, and that they bee not cast away. For they bee holy thinges and deputed and appointed ones to god. But as touching the thinges signifyed and represented by the out warde sygnes, (that is to wete, the bodye and bloud of Christe, we dooe quickely and without any sticking graunte that they shoulde bee wurshipped. For Austen sayeth in thys place. There is none offence dooen in wurshyppyng of Chrystes fleashe: But there is an offense committed in not wurshyppinge of it. But yet dooeth Austen foorth with warne vs that we shulde nottary or fixe our mindes vpon the fleashe of Christ: but that we should lyft vp oure myndes to hys godly nature and to hys deitee, to the whyche deyte Christes fleashe is ioygned and knitte wyth suche a knotte as can not bee vnlooced for els (sayeth he) Caro non prodest quicquam sed spiritus est qui viuificat. that is the fleshe dooeth nothynge proffyt nor auaile. But it is the spyryte that quickneth and geueth lyfe. where marke, that thys saynge of Christe whyche is wrytten in the sixth chapytur of Iohns ghospell, is vnderstanded and taken of Austen concernynge Chrystes fleashe, and not after a carnall and fleashely vnderstandynge of the same, as some men wolde ha
                  •
               e it. But nowe for wurshyppynge of it I wyl here bryefly touche and in fewe wordes repeate the same.
            
               Whyche before thys time I spake whan I declared this epistle: whyche was that adoracion or wurshypping, consisteth in Inuocatyon or callyng vpon, (as whan we praie to God) and in confessyng or acknowelaygeyng, (whyche confessing is of two sortes the one with the hert, and the other with the mouth,) and in thankes geuing. Al these thīges bee dewe both to god and to Chryste where and whan soeuer he declareth hymselfe vnto vs. And this is doone three manier of wayes: fyrst by reason of goddes woorde inwardly considered when some vehement thynkynge vpon God and Christe cometh into oure myndes, by the strength and power of the holy ghoste. And than dooeth wurshyppynge folowe streygth waye. For eyther we confesse and knoweledge his maiestie to bee moste excellent. &c. or els we call vpon him to helpe vs, or els we thanke hym for hys goodenesse shewed vnto mankynde. And these thynges dooe sometymes, declare themselfes vnto vs by externall and outward woordes, that is to wete, as often as we ourselues reade the holie scryptures, or els whan we heare godly sermōs. For in this case we be many times prouoked to calle vpon God or to dooe other thynges whiche perteyne to the nature of godly wurshyppīg. To bee shorte, Chryste and god sometymes dooeth declare hymselfe by outewarde sygnes as he dyd in ye Mounte of Synai vnto Moses, and to the prophet Isai in lykenesse of a kinge sitting in his regall throne.Exod. xix. In the arke of promyse, and in the Sacramentes.Isay. vi. And here also is adoracion or wurshipping vsed. But like as Austen gaue warnynge or exhorted vs, that we shoulde notte sette oure myndes and stayghe onelye

vpon the fleashe, but that we shoulde goe for warde lifting vpon our myndes to his deite or godhead: So doe I now here geue warnyng, that whan we receiue the sacramente we should not stoppe or tarie in the outward signes wt our wurshipping, but that we shuld in spirite and in truth wurship Christe that sitteth in heauen at the right hande of the father. Which thing because some vnlearned people dooe not vnderstande by reason of this false opinion of transubstanciacion beeing now confirmed and rooted in mens myndes: therfore I would thynke it not vnprofitable, if we did refreine our selues from outwarde wurshipping of it, as frō prostration or kneelyng, vntyl suche tyme, as the rude sorte and ignoraunt people were better enstructed & taught therin. Inward wurshippyng maye bee vsed without daungier: nether were the outwarde worshyppyng ill in his owne true naturall vse. For many menne dooe godlye and reuerentlye bowe theyr knee whan they heare those wordes of the ghospell et ver
                  
                     •
                  um caro factum est that it is to saye. And that word became fleashe. &c. And yet is it not to bee sayed of them, that they wurship the veray wordes, but the thynges that is sygnyfyed by the woordes.
            Whyche same selfe thynge what stop or lette is there but that it may bee dooen in thys matyer of the sacramente, so that the outewarde sygnes bee no
                  •
                wurshypped, but the thynge that is sygnyfyed by the sygnes. But in these present dayes peraduenture outewarde wurshyppynge is not expedyent to bee vsed for the foresayde cause, vnlesse often mention shoulde bee made of suche matyers in the sermons to the people.
            
               And yet leat not any man take occasion of these my woordes, to saye, or thinke that it is lawfull to worshyp Images or pictures, because that god and Christe dooe seme some times in them to declare him selfe effectually vnto vs. For we haue plain wordes of scripture yt we shal not make vnto vs any Images to worshyp them. But as touchynge the wordes of holy scrypture, and as touchyng the sacramentes here is nothyng to the contrarye but that in hearynge or receyuyng them we maye worship them, because they bee thynges instituted and ordeyned by the woord, the wyll, and the commaundemente of god, too the entente that we might therby bee prouoked to the due seruynge of good, whiche seruynge of god, consisteth much in adoracion and humble wurshipping of hym. Neyther can ye also of thys matyer, or of any my wordes gather that any parte that remayneth after the receyuynge of the sacramente should be wurshiped. For what so euer strength the outewarde sygnes in the sacramentes haue, they haue it of the holy ghoste, of the lordes woordes, and of hys institucyon, and ordinaunce. Whyche thynges dooe no longer remain, then whyle the vse and receyuynge of the sacramente dooeth continue. And the promisse of God, is applied to thys sacramente whiles we eate and drink the sacramente. Wherfore yt opinion and doctrine of reseruing the sacrament was not Catholike, nor vniuersalli vsed or receyueth in ye Christyā cōgregaciōs. For in ye time of Hesythius (as hym self testifieth wrytyng vpō the booke of Moses that is entitled leuiticus) that yt was least of ye sacramēt, was burnt which selfsame thing yu haste also in Orygyen vpon the same booke entitled

Leuiticus (though it bee but al one booke a scribed to know men. And clement bysshop of Rome did ordein or make, that the leauynges of this sacrament should be eaten of the clerkes, as it plainelye appereth in his decree which is writtē in the title de consecratione, that is of consecration, and in the second distinction. We doe not denie but yt the leauinges of ye sacramēt wer sōetimes reserued & kept: but it was doen wtout any wurshipping of it, & without any supersticious pointes of reuerence. The leauynges of this sacramente wer deliuered to children and to women to bee caryed to sicke folk, as it is plain in ye historie of Eusebius & in Hierome one of the doctours of the Churche. And I wolde sū
               what stagger to saye ye receyuinge of suche leauinges beyng doen privatly out of ye holy compaignie, & with out the ordier and manier of receyuing the communiō instituted of Christe, was a right, a full, and a perfect receiuing of ye cōmunion or of ye sacramēt which receiuing of ye sacrament emōg the sicke folkes, I could yet neuerthelesse graūt vnto, so yt thesame do repeate y• holy wordes of Christ & so y• some honest Christiās doe there emōg thēselues put in vse ye ordinance of Christ in this behalf. For except mo persons thē one alone do receiue ye cōmunion together: the due ordre & course of receyuing this sacramēt is not obserued & kept. Christes wordes wer to me thē one, in this sort: Accipe, edite et bi

And thei speake many thinges in theyr canon of the olde Masse, whiche vnlesse a nomber dooe receyue it together, are sterke false and veray

lyes. And besides this, it is called of learned men. Coena a supper, Communio, a communiō, and sinaxis a gathering or cōming together: which names do nothīg agre wt a priuate acciō or doyng of one persō alone by himselfe. Neither do we in any place reade in olde writers of any priuate masses where one alone might receiue the sacrament without the companie of others Honorius byshop of Rome was ye fyrst yt made a decree yt the sacrament of Eucharistia should be reserued & kepte and decreed ferther that honour and reuerence should bee dooen to it.Honorius bishoppe of Rome. Whan it was caryed abrode any whither. That if this thyng had been dooen of others before his dayes. It had not belōged vnto hym to make a decree of any suche thyng. And to speake in a briefe summe, we affirme & hold (as we haue before saide) yt this Sacramente hath not his ful strengthe & vert

                  swered vnto. but he had veray great controuersies and disputacions with the Arrians against whō he wryteth. Whiche Arrians thought that the father and the soonne wer none other wise knitte or ioyned together, but by a concord and agrement of wyll, and by suche vnitie of minde, that whatsoeuer the father would the sōne wolde thesame. Agaynst these Arrians.
            
               Hilarius thus sayth: I demaund of you this questiō, whether the cōioynyng & vnitie that is betwene vs & Christe bee of the propretee of nature, or els of the cō
               corde and vnitie of mynde and wyll. For the Arrians woulde for their purpose haue caught holde on that that place, in whiche Christe prayed that we mighte

be made one with hym, as he and his father bee one betwene themselues. The text or sentence is in the seuenth chapitur of Iohns ghospel, whece it is sayd: Neuerthelesse I pray not for them alone but for thē also which shal beleue on thē through theyr preachinge, that they all maye bee one as thou father arte in me, and I in thee: that they also maye be one in vs, that the worlde maye beleue that thou haste sente me. &c.
            The Heretiques did putte this glose to it that we and Christe wer none otherwyse ioygned and knitte together, but by consente and vnitie of wille: and ther of they gatheredde and concludedde, that ther was in like mannier none other couplynge and knittinge together of the sonne of god with the father, but only thissame knittynge together and vnion of mynde and wyll. It was Hilarius parte therefore to decclare that we are knitte and made one with Christe naturallye, that he might conclude, that the sonne of God also is naturally ioyned to ye father in very substaunce. The prouing therfore of Hilarius cōclusiō renneth thus: If the sonne of God did truly & verily take the nature or substaunce of man vpō hym he agreeth with vs naturally in his fleshe, & we bee sayed to abide in him be cause he hath oure nature in hym. And agayn for the other side when we receyue the meate which was instituted of Christe, yf we dooe truely and veraily receyue his fleshe, we are partakers with hym naturally, and he doeth trulye and veraily abide in vs. And

thus doeth Hilarius take and frame his argumente of the veritee and trueth of the sacramentes, whiche veritee or to bee in the sacramentes we dooe not denye. And this was a common custome emong the auncient wryters, to fetche the grounde of theyr argumentes out of the Sacramentes as thinges most perfitly knowē to al Christē mē. And of al these thinges there is not one iote that is contrary to our sentence and determinacion. For it is no part of Hilarius entente to proue that Christes fleashe lieth hidden vnder the accidentes of bread, or in this sacrament: but he maketh proufe onely and so concludeth, that we bee truely and verayly ioyned vnto Christes fleshe whan we receyue the sacrament, which thing we do not deny nor say agaynst. But ye that make so muche a do for transubstanciacion, marke me this poinct, yt the same self Hilarius a litle before these wordes whiche he writeth of Eucharistia, doeth say the very same thinge of baptisme, yt through baptisme we be ioyned vnto Christ, & euery on
                  •
                of vs to other not only by an vnion of consent & agreyng to gether in minde & will, but also in an vnitie of nature & substaunce. Wherfore it ye same thinge so be, than are ye cōpelled & driuen of force to putte a trā
               substanciacion in Baptisme too, yf ye beeyng a transubstanciacion into the sacrament of Eucharistia for ye respect aboue mencioned. Chrisostome doeth not muche varie from this custome of framing his argumentes out of the sacramentes. For in his eightie eighte Homelie vpon the ghospell of Mathew he sayeth (as we alledged before) that these bee the signes or Sacramentes of oure Lorde Iesus, with the whiche wee do both brydle and stop the mouthes of Heretiques.
            
               For they oftentimes saie: howe did Christe suffer? And we on oure side obiecte agaynst them again. If Christ had not verai true & natural fleash in dede, thā are these signes but vain thinges, whych thing foloweth veray well. For els the sacramentes shoulde signifye and represente vnto vs, feigned thynges. And thus the mouthes of the Manichees of the Marcionites, and of suche other pernicious heretiques, wer stopped of Chrisostome and suche others as he was. As touchyng Leo byshope of Rome,An aūswere to Leo Bysshoppe of Rome. there is no cause why to take muche ca

For he in the sentence and determinacion of the sacramentes yt is layd vnto vs, doth both graūt a mystycal dystribucyon of it to mo then one, and also dooeth putte a spirytuall nourishyng, and an heauenly vertue, and affyrmeth that we bee transfourmed and chaunged into Chrystes fleashe, as he tooke our fleashe and nature vpon him.

                that is to saye, touche thou Chrystes bodye wyth thy mynde, and take thou his bodye wyth the hande of thy herte. In the whyche woordes it is plain, that he dooeth affyrme and holde, that we dooe eate Chrystes bodye spirytually when we receue the sacrament.
            And he moreouer byndeth earnestly (as the other olde wryters dooe) vpon the chaungeyng of vs into Chryst, whych chaūgeinge neuerthelesse is doen (as we see) without any transubstancyatynge of vs.
            
               I knowe that many men maye meruaile, why we so often times dooe matche that same chaungeing whyche the olde wryters seme to speake of in the sygnes or sacramentes, wyth the chaungyng of vs into Chryst, whyche they all dooe graunte and constauntly affyrme. And some men dooe imagin, that there is another manier of ioygnynge betwene Chrystes bodye and the sacramente, then there is betwene vs and Chrystes bodye: and that therefore thys proporcion and comparisō hath no place in this matier, although ye old wryters affirme & avouche both chaunginges.
            To suche persones we aunswer and saye, that oure argumente is moste pithie and strong. For the reason dooeth argue (as the Logicyans termes be) a maiore ad minus, that is to saye, from the more necessarye requisyte to the lesse, and that regatiuely, that is to saye, in the waye of denyinge a thing to bee so or so. For ther is a greater coniunction and couplyng together of Chryste vnto vs and to suche as dooe receyue the communion, then there is of Chryste wyth these outwarde signes of the sacramente. For somuche therfore as in vs to bee knitte vnto Christ and to bee made one wyth hym, there is no transubstanciacion required: muche lesse is there any suche transubstanciacion requyred in the sayd outward sygnes of the sacramē
               te. And that we be more nere ioygned and knitte vnto Chryste, then the outeward signes of the sacramente,we are more nere ioyned

And as touchyng Theophylactus, we saie yt he is but a newe wryter and a man that wrote but of late dayes,Theophilactus aunswered vnto. and paraduenture, that chaunced to lyue in those daies whan many doubtes and disputacions be gonne to bee moued aboute thys transubstanciacyon, that is to wete Nycolas the byshop of Rome, at what tyme Ranfrancke and Berengarius were alyue. Morouer Theophylactus was a man of no great iudgemente, as it maie full well appere by hys declaracyon and exposicyon of the thyrde chapytur of the ghospell of Iohn towardes the later ende of the chapytur, where he ch
                  •
               cketh expressely by name the latin Churche concernynge the procedynge of the holy Ghoste, because the latin Churche hade determined, that the procedinge of the holy Ghoste is from the father and the soonne. Therfore we wyll not thinke nor repute his aucthoritye to be of so greate weight, that it ought to bee preiudicyall to the trueth. Yet neuerthelesse, leat vs ponder & weighe his woordes he saieth yt the bread is not a signe of Christes body: & this he sayeth vpon Mathewes Ghospell, which thyng is well spoken, if he mene that y• bread is not an emptye figure, or a vain figure & void of al strēgth & efficacy. Neither do we saie yt ye bred is suche a signe or figure. And we do nothīg doubt, but y• this was his interpretaciō & mening in dede for because yt vpō Markes gospel he saith that the bread is not a figure not onely.
            
               For els, if he shoulde vtterly denye that the bread is a signe or a figure of Christes bodi, he should be contrary to the rest of the fathers and olde writers whom we haue alredy plainly declared to graunte and putte bothe a sygne and a fygure to bee heere in this sacramente. He saieth also yt the bread is transformed conuerted and chaunged from the elemente and matier that it was afore, into an other. Whiche maniers of speaking if he vnderstande and mene Sacramentally, we dooe not abhorre from them. For the breade and wyne become sacramentes, & they passe & bee chaunged into elementes, that is to saye, matyers of heauenly thynges and they putte on as it were a newe garmente and shape to bee nowe the sygnes and tokens of an higher matier.
            But (saye they) thys Theophylactus wryteth that the fleashe and the bloude for thys cause bee not seen, leste oure stomackes shoulde stande agaynste the receyuynge of it. But if thou (what soeuer thou bee) wilt so eagrely and so sore bynde vpon these woordes: we for oure parte laye agaynst the agayne, the wordes that the same Theophylactus wryteth vpon Markes ghospell: whyche are, that the kyndes or symylitudes of breade and wyne bee turned into the vertue or strength of the lordes bodye and bloud.
            That if thou wilt allege that the sayd Theophylactus dooeth in all other places not saye, into the vertue. &c. But, into Christes boddye and bloud:The kindes and similitudes of breade and wine cōuerted into the vertue of Christes body & bloude we aunswere, that the interpretacion of these wordes is, yt these sygnes take vnto them the vertue of the thynges whyche they signyfye, by reason of the whyche vertue, the sacramentes bee of no lesse effecte,

And (as I haue sayed) the yrkesomnes and abhorrynge of it is taken away, yf we putte that the chaunge is made not into the thinge, but in to the vertue of the thing. Hys other sentence semeth to bee somewhat more violēte and of some more force & vehemencye
                  •
                whych he wroote vpon the sixth chapytur of Ihons ghospell, where he thus sayeth: As the breade that Chryste did eate whyles he lyued here in yearthe, was chaunged into his fleashe by a naturall transubstanciation or chaungeyng after the common rate of foode and nourishement in mannes bodye: so is this breade chaunged into Christes body here in the Sacramente. Yet this similitude and comparison we graunte also to bee true yf it bee generally taken. For in this sacrament also, we dooe not denye but there is a chaunge Sacramentall, that is to saye, suche as in a Sacrament is required.
            That if thou saye thou wylte nedes take this similitude euen plainly as it is made, and as it souneth, whiche is that the breade bee as verayly chaunged in the Sacramente of Eucharistia, as breade was turned into Christes fleshe at suche tymes as he eate it whiles he here lyued: than wyll there folowe an inconuenience cleane contrary to thyne owne sentence and determination.
            For it wyll folowe, that the accidentes of the signes cannot remayne or be reserued still in the Sacramente of Eucharistia. For in thee foode and sustenaunce that Christe tooke frome time to tyme whiles he liued, the ac

               Besydes the premisses, I wyll here allege for our purpose the woordes of the same selfe expositour vpon the sixth chapitur of Iohns gospell, vpon these woordes: he that eateth my fleashe, and drynketh my bloude, abideth in me, and I in hym. &c. Upon whiche woordes Theophylactus expounyng them in the persone of Christ, saith that this thyng is dooen, whiles the partie is quodammodo, that is to saye, in a manier mingled and ioygned vnto me, and is chaunged ouer into me.
            Where thou seest agayne, that Theophilactus holdeth (as the reste of the fathers and wryters dooe holde) that there is so great a chaungeyng of vs into Christe, that he wryteth vs to bee chaunged ouer and dooe passe into Christe.
            And thus muche I saye at this present for aunswere of that that was broughte in and allegedde agaynste vs out of Theophylactus. Of the later wryters they bryng Anselmus, and Hugo,Anselmus and Hugo aunswered vnto. and Rycharde whiche were in the tyme of Uictor.

For he is a wonderous great fauourer of Images, and susteyned both great and sore daungiers mo then one for vpholdynge and maynteining of them: yea and in this selfsame fourth booke he wrote a seuerall chapitur of a sette purpose concernyng the same matier of Images: where his mynde & sentence is, yt Images not onelye are to bee made, but also to be honoured and wurshypped. Besides this, he so highly estemed the reliques of sainctes and holy men whiche are now in rest, that he appointed vnto them also a certayne chapitur for the nonce in whiche he feared not to call the sayed reliques, the

fountaynes and welles of the giftes of God. And he is so bold there as to saye that we are bound to worshyp the Sainctes with feith, whiche is a pointe vntollerable, forsomuche as feyth is due onelye to God and to his wordes. He hath also a sermon concerninge purgatorie, in which his opinion is, that Traianus the Emperour of Rome (who had liued bothe an Idolater & also a persecutour of Martyrs,) was deliu

Now as touching the exposition of scriptures, the self same Damascen whan he wryteth of the resurreccion, he laboureth to proue it by a place in the booke of Genesis,Gen. ix. where it is red that the lord saied to Noe. Fleashe with the bloude shalte thou not eate, for I shall requyre your solles at the handes of the beastes. He wyll require them (saieth Damascene) at the resurrectiō. For the beastes dooe not dye for mannes sake. Wherein he appereth to be ignoraunt of the law that was made of god in the boke of Exodus, and in the boke of Deuteronomye,

where it is commaunded that the Oxe whiche renneth at menne with his hornes, and sleagheth anye bodye, shall bee stoned to death.
            The same Damascene also in his booke De Virginitate, that is saye, of virginitie, writeth in this manier. If Adam had not synned, man and woman

               g foorth issue. And because he seeth the sentence and determinacion of God to bee agaynste hym, in these woordes, Grow ye, and be ye multiplyed: he sayeth that it was perhaps possible that menne shoulde haue multiplyed and gotten issue oute of some other parte of the bodye. There is not one of the schoole diuines that would thus haue sayd. Thesame Damascene also wresteth and raketh Basilius.Damascene wres
                     •
                  eth basilius. For because he seeth Basilius to affirme that the breade & the wyne are as it wer the countrepaynes, or paternes of Christes body he expouneth Basilius to mene that same before the consecratyon: Whiche is a pointe without all ryme or reason
            For the breade and the wyne before consecracyon haue nothynge at all in them, more then other common meates haue. And in case the bread and wyne shoulde in suche wyse sygnyfye the bodye and bloude of Chryste, than shoulde they bee nowe alreadye Sacramentes before the pronouncing of the Lordes woordes.
            Besydes this, in the Masse of the Greke Churche they dooe after the consecracion in moste open and playne woordes praye that the breade maye be made the bodye and bloude of Christe.
            
               And namely in the masse of Basilius, the matyer so renneth, that the sayd woordes are sette after the consecracyon.
            Yea and in our Canon also that was vsed in the olde masse yf it bee well loked vpon, it is named bread after the consecracion. But now are hys argumentes to be consydered and examined. The fyrste of them is grounded vpon the power of god, for seeynge that god was of power to create bothe heauen and yearth by hys woorde, and by the same woorde to brynge foorthe plantes and trees, beastes, foules and fysshes: why shoulde he not bee of power to make hys owne bodye of breade: But thys kynde of argumente is of the weakeste and febleste sorte that can be
                  •
               .
            Neyther dooe we now traicte or despute of the power of god For we dooe not denye that god is hable to turne breade into fleashe: But all oure varyaunce is, whether he wyll so dooe or not. Another argumen
                  •
               e of hys is taken & framed out of Chrystes manier of speaking. For saieth Damascene, it was not sayed of the lorde: Thys is the fygure or sygnes of my bodye, but is called the veray bodye of the lorde. But vnto thys argumente we haue alreadye made aunswere afore.
            And in case thys man whan he denyeth the sacramente to bee a fygure of the lordes bodye, dooeth vnderstande it absolutelye, and euen as the woordes soune wythout any ferther addycyon, or interpretacion: he hath in manier all the auncyente fathers and olde wryters agaynste hym, who euerye one of them dooe heere in thys matyer acknowlege a fygure.
            
               But in case he vnderstande it to bee not a figure onely, that is to saie, a vaine & a voyd signe, We our selfes also dooe wyllingly graunte so muche vnto him Albeit he dooeth here & there in hys wrytynges entre lace certain wordes in whiche he maie appere not to haue been of so grosse an opiniō concernyng the sacramente, as he maketh for. For in one place he hath these wordes.
            The bread of the cōmuniō is not simple & bare breade onely: but it hath a godly vertu ioygned vnto it. Whiche poynte we shal wythout any great stickyng admitte, forasmuche as we saye not that the breade is in thys case common breade or mere breade, but that it is now a breade halowed, and turned into the nature of a sacramente. And godly vertue maye for thys cause bee sayed to bee ioygned vnto it, because that ye holy ghoste dooeth vse thesame as an instrumente towardes our saluation. Besides the premisses, he maketh a comparison betwene thys sacramente and baptisme, in whyche cō
               parison he sayeth that god hath customably vsed to cō
               descende vnto our vsage, and to our familiar facions that we are acquainted withall, and because that men are woont to bee washed wyth water, and to bee enoyn
                  •
               ted wyth oyle: therefore god hath ioygned and geuen hys grace vnto these thynges, and hys spirite vnto baptisme. And in lyke manier forasmuche as it is the custome and vsage of men to eate breade and to drynke wyne: he gaue and ioygned hys godhed vnto these thynges.
            But now after the transubstātiacyons, god should

not haue ioygned hys godly power or hys godhed vnto these thynges: but he shuld clene haue put away these other natures of breade and wyne.
            And the reason and circumstaunce of the sayed com
                  •
               parison dooeth require, that lyke as the ioygnyng of baptesme wyth grace and wyth the holy ghoste doeth not put awaye nor destruye the nature, of the water: euen so the thynges of thys sacramentes should not destruye or cast awaye the beeyng and the true nature of the signes. Damascene sayeth morouer that god did so condescende vnto our custome & vsage, that by meane of suche thynges as are familiarly vsed emōg vs, and are within the ordre and course of nature, we shoulde bee placed and sette in those thynges whiche are aboue nature. In whyche place he toucheth also of our chaungeyng into Christe. But it is here to bee noted, that he affirmeth the outward signes and matier of the sacramentes to bee thynges accordynge to nature, that is to saye, naturall thynges, and thynges of their own natures.
            That yf ye putte thesame to bee accidentes onelye and withoute a subiecte, or accidentes that haue the bodye of Christe hidden vnder them: than are thei not any longer to bee taken for thynges of theyr owne nature, or for thynges within the ordre and course of nature.
            And Damascen vseth suche playne termes in ye matier that he affirmeth the nature of bread to be chaunged ouer, to bee taken to another thynge and to be made Christes body: which wordes chaunge

yf they bee taken and vnderstanded of a Sacramentall chaunge, they make nothynge at all agaynste vs.
            And where he also sayeth that these chaunges happen aboue nature, we admitte and graunte that too. For it is not of any naturall propretee belongynge vnto common breade, that a sacrament shoulde bee made thereof, no more then the fountayne of oure regeneracion or newe birth to bee made naturallye of water.
            That yf ye demaunde of Damascene the manier howe this chaungeynge of the breade into Christes body commeth to passe: he aunswereth that it is not a lyghte mattier euen for vs to expresse the mannier howe breade in oure naturall foode and susteinaunce is chaunged into oure fleashe.
            But as touchynge this similitude and comparison howe it maye bee taken, we haue sayed sufficiently afore whan we spake of Theophylactus. If ye take this similitude generallye, and applye it to a Sacramentall chaunge, it is veraye well, but if ye will haue the comparison specially made of suche a mutacion or chaungeynge, as there is of the foode that we take in oure bodyes, whan it is turned into our fleashe: than shall ye make not onelye the nature of breade to geue place and to departe awaye, but also the accidentes therof to dooe thesame.
            Damascene after all this affirmeth the breade so to bee made Christes bodye, and the wyne and water in suche wyse to bee made his bloude, that the

same are nowe not twoo thynges, but one. If he referre this terme, to bee one thynge, and not twayne, to the cuppe and the breade, as though he should saye that these twoo are one Sacramente: We wyll make no greate a dooe in the mattier, (for in this accion or dooyng, as in one Sacramente, Christe is offred vnto vs, for a foode.
            And yet in takynge bothe partes of this Sacramente, the Churche is not a fearde to speake of theym as thoughe they were twoo, and to saye, that there bee Sacramentes here. And in the collectes whiche they were woont to saye in theyr olde Masse they did after the communion manye tymes saye these woordes.
            The Sacramentes whiche we haue receyued. &c.
            But an yf they affirme them in suche wyse to bee one, that after the consecracion the breade and Christes bodye bee nowe one thyng, and notte twayne, for the transubstanciation that is incedente vnto it: than wyll we sette agaynste this the sentence and determinacion of Ireneus, in whiche he wryteth the Sacramente of Eucharistia to consiste of twoo thynges, the one yearthelye, and the other heauenlye: We also sette agaynste theym Gelasius sometyme Byshop of Rome who speakyng of ye vniō of the humayne nature and diuine nature in Christe, bothe the sayde natures remayning wholle and vndefyled, argueth and proueth it to bee true by the conioning and couplyng of the bread with Christes bodye in this sacramente, bothe natures remaynynge whole

and perfect. He affirmeth moreouer that this Sacrament is not cast downe in the draught. Neyther can it in veray dede otherwyse bee spoken of the transubstanciatours. For wheras they put and holde that in this sacrament of Eucharistia there is nothynge but the accidentes of breade and of wyne, and the nature of Christes bodye: there doeth no parte of these thynges belong to any draught. But against the premisses I wyll now bryng in and obiecte a most manifest place of Origen vpon Mathew in ye fiftenth chaptur, wher he expouneth and declareth these woordes of the Euāgelist: That that entreth īto the mouth, defileth not a man. And there dooeth Origen saye thus:Origens mynde of the sacramente whether it goe into the draughte or not. If it dooe not defyle a man, than dooeth it not sanctifie hym and make hym holy neither. But what shall we saye of the Lordes breade? Is it true that it neyther maketh a man holye, nor defileth hym? he aunswereth: that lyke as if any thing seme vnpure, it nothynge at all defyleth vs except through a corrupt conscience in vs: Euen so also that that appereth and is called holy, dooeth not sanctifye vs nor make vs holy, vnlesse there bee righteousnesse wythin vs, and perfectenesse of life. For if of it owne nature it had the propretee to sanctifie & to make holy: than should there not haue been many sicke emōg the Corinthians, and many haue died. Where fore that that is materiall or grosse and corruptible in the lordes breade, dooeth passe down into the bealie, and is cast o
                  •
               t into the draught: and that that is by humble prayer & by the lordes woorde, is profitable vnto the solle accordyng to the porcion of euerie mannes feyth. It is not than the materiall parte of the lordes breade that

is profitable: but the woord that is put thereto is the thynge that auayleth. And to the entente that one shoulde not thynke hym to speake of any other meate: he repeateth it agayne in a briefe summe, and sayeth: Thus muche haue we spoken of the mystycall and Sacramentall bodye of Christe.
            Nowe leate not anye manne to impougne this that we haue sayed, cauill and saye, that Origen did nowe and than erre in diuerse opinions and articles. For Hierome, Epiphanius, and the olde aunciente fathers, whiche didde with all possible diligence searche and bryng foorth his erroures to lyghte, dooe not in anye place make mencion that he was in anye wronge opinion of the Sacramente, whiche thynge they woulde neuer haue leafte vnspoken, yf he hadde in so greate a mattier gonne neuer so lytle oute of square.
            And Origen in the place afore alleged moste manifestly and plainly addeth these woordes also, that the wycked sorte dooe not eate Christes bodie, because that Christes bodye is a thyng that geueth life, and he that eateth it, abydeth in Christe. Wherfore agaynst thys Ihon Damascene beeyng but a newe wryter of late yeres, & a man not of so great a name to speake of, leat Origene bee sette, who is bothe a veray auncient wryter and also estemed of al men for a ryght famous Clerke.

               n betwene them but of a dignitee and woorthynesse in Chryste. And Cyryllus argueth agaynste the sayde Nestoryus takynge hys argumente of the nature of the sacramentes. If the fleashe of Chryste sayeth Cyrylus bee after that sorte seperated from the persone of the deitee and Godhed: than it foloweth that the same is not of power to geue life and whan we eate in the sacramentes the fleash of Chryste, we shoulde eate the fleashe of some holy and excelente man and no better. But thereby shoulde we not obteyne eternall lyfe accordynge to the promyses.
            Thys is the marcke and ende of all those dysputacyons. Those fathers dooe not contende, neither goo they aboute to enforce or affyrme that the fleashe of Chryst lyeth hydden in the bread: but theyr mynde is, that we

            To the whyche Councelles, for asmuche as the actes & determinacions of them are not abrode nor sette foorth in wrytinge, we haue not muche to aunswere. Wherfore it shall not be vnprofytable to examyne & weygh the sayd retractacyon or recantaciō prescrybed & wryten word by word in the sayd councell vnto Berengarius, by the sayd Nicolas than byshope of Rome as is afore sayed, and than by that we shalle perceyue what grauitee there was in that same Coū

            For thys gloser sawe well ynough, that it was not conuenyent nor decent to saye, that the bodye of Chryste shoulde bee sensybly handeled, broken, or brused wyth the mynysters teeth in the sacramente.

But this fyguratyue manier of speking yf we dooe vse neuer so aptely or conueniently, and duely, interpretyng the sayinges of the fathers when they vse woordes of high reuerence in speaking of this sacramente: our aduersaires make a wounderfull out crye at the matier, allegeying that we dooe corrupte and marre and also falsifye the auncient fathers wrytynges, not with standing that thei them selues dooe here flee to the same ancores and refuge, and wil haue a trope or figure to be where none ought to be, namely in the openyng and declaryng of a doctryne, and in framyng of a recantacion, whyche ought of all other thynges to bee moste clere & plain.

            Neither is it of anye sorte that manye menne saye it was there but confyrmed by a decree,The opiniō of transubstanciacion is not olde. and not firste constituted, because that vnder the forsayde Nycolas Bishoppe of Rome in the counsayle of Uercelles and Rome, the same sentence and decree of transubstanciacion hadde been manifestlye ynough declared.
            For truelye we graunte that this opinion before the counsayle of Constaunce did (I cannot tell howe) after a sorte but breake foorth, and so was violentely and parforce thrust into the Churche: But because it was not fullye receyued, but had euery where manye contradictions and gainsayinges: they iudge it necessarye to bee established agayne by a newe decree, and that veray cruely, euen with fyre and deadlye threatenynges.

                  •
               st this councell we obiecte the generall and vniuersall councell holden at Florence vnder Eugenius the fowerth bishoppe of Rome, who was there presente, and there was also presente the Emperoure of the Grekes together with the Patriarkes of Constantinople, and many Bishops mo of the Easte partes. In the whiche counsell the Churche of the Grekes was reconciled and ioigned to the Churche of the Latines, and there they agreed as touchyng the discorde and controuersye that had been concernynge the holye Ghost. And in the actes of the counsayle it is to be seen that after the Bisshoppes of the Easte parties and ye Latines had agreed vpō certain articles: ye Bishop of Rome than beyng would haue proceded ferther & would haue driuen them to traicte of transubstanciation, & to receiue it as the Latines did beleue it. But here the grekes stiffely wt stode hym, & wold in no wyse traict of any suche matier. Neither could they be moued nor induced by any argumentes to cōsent therunto.

Churche of the Grekes not receyuing thesame. For nowe of dayes they saye it is a veray pernicious and a detestable H

               resie not to admit transubstanciō. Nor it is not to be thought nor supposed, that the Latine churche would haue coupled her self with heretiques and been one with them. By this also is the argumēt made voyde and of none effecte, whiche they broughte of the vniuersal consent and agrement of the churche. For it is not true which they affirme, that all Christen churches did conspire and agree in this article of transubstanciacion. For that same auncient churche which was in the tyme of the fathers (as we haue shewed) did neuer ymagine nor deuise any suche matier: Also the Greke churche of the East parties was not in like opinion that we haue been in. Besydes al this, to their argumentacions they adde mooste hyghe prayses of the diuine and godly power,To the Argument of

But this is an argumente moste weake and feble, for the thynge whiche they ought chiefely to haue shewed, they haue neuer yet hitherto truely proued, whiche it is, that god will dooe it, and that the holye scriptures dooe promise suche a thyng vnto vs. For these woordes whiche they allege that is to wete, This is my body, th

               It might haue been saied vnto hym: Chryste hath euen now affyrmed that it shall so be whi dooest than doubte of the power of God, by the whyche all thinges wer created. By the same power of God maiest thou vndoubtedlye bee borne againe out of thy mothers wombe. But the matyer was not so handeled: But Chryste declared that all thys shoulde bee dooen by a spyrytuall regeneracyon. For although he made mencion of the water whyche parteyneth to baptisme, Yet did he most manyfestly teache, that the regeneracion must be dooen by the spirite. And euen so dooe we see it happen herein thys matier of the sacramente.
            Chryst commaundeth vs to eate hys fleash, and he takynge the breade in hys hande, sayethe: This is my bodye. Now the transubstanciatours said: It cannot bee that the bodye of Chryste shoulde bee to gether with the bread, Wherefore, it must nedes folow that the nature of the breade, bee turned by transubstanciacyon into Chrystes body. And that it is so transubstauncyated, they wyll nedes parswade men by an argumente of the power of God,Why the fathers speakin

But in the meane whyle, the transubstanciatours dooe thus obiecte agaynst vs We dooe not thys alowe, (say they,) for Chrysostome, Ambrose, & Cyrillus, whan they traict of thys mutacion: the lykewyse remit vs to the power of god, & magnyfye the same power of god wt wunderful high laudes & praises. But to thys we aunswer, yt the fathers speake veray wel, for vndoubtedly, it belongeth to ye power of God so to chaunge breade and wyne that they bee made sacramentes, whyche they wer not afore: neyther is it the worke of nature that bread and wine should

               fe, is of great strength and vertue: & the wordes beeyng at the fyrst pronounced by the inspiracion of God and now repeated agayn by the ministre dooe weorke no smalle effecte. Ye maye to the premisses putte our conuersion and chaungeyng into Christe whan we dooe receiue the communion, all whiche thynges are ferre aboue the power & strength of nature. And now wher as the supernatural power of the lorde maye bee required to al these thynges: these men applye ye sayd power of God to transubstanciacion. But thys is a muche lyke thyng as it we should make an argumente and should reason, (as the logicians termes bee) ab vniuersiliore ad particularius, that is to saie, from the more general to the lesse general affirmatyuely, that is, by the waye of affirmyng a thyng to bee thus or thus, whiche is the wourstkynde of argumente that can bee made: as for exā

Ergo it is a tree, is a veray good reason and a well framed argumente. So, to saye: Goddes wyll is to dooe suche a thyng or suche a thyng: ergo he can dooe it, is a perfeicte good reason. But the
                  •
               e can not bee a lewder manier of arguyng, then to saye. God is of power to dooe suche a

thyng: ergo he wyl dooe it, or dooeth it.
            For God is of power euen now at this daye to heale all diseases and sicknesses of all men, to make the dum to speake, to restore sight vnto the blynde, and to reuiue men that are dead, (as Christe reised Lazarus, and as he wrought the thynges afore spoken

            But to say that he so doeth wer false: and to require that he should so dooe, wer a tēptyng of hym not ferre differing from blasphemie.
            But to returne to thys matier that we now haue in hande, it maye ferther bee sayed that in Baptisme also is required the same power of god. For it is not a weorke of nature, that water should bee made the fountaine of our regeneracion

                or newe birth in Christe.
            But here some persones can not euen veray wel heate, that baptisme should bee after thys sorte cōpared with the sacramente of Eucharistia, For although they can not saye nay but that Chri

on in whether of bothe sacramentes Christe bee after a more excellent sorte conteined, then in the other, so that he bee graunted to bee present in theym bothe.
            And as he maye bee in the one wythout any transubstanciacion of the elementes, that is to saye, of the naturalle thynges that the sac

            That if ye wyll nedes striue about the dignitee of the sayd two sacramentes whether of them is the more excellent: than maye the excellencie of baptisme bee proued by argumentes tyght effectuall and pitthye. For fyrst, it is a greatter matier to bee generate and borne, then it is to bee nourished.
            Secondely baptisme was honoured and notified, wyth a noumbre of miracles at once: for the heauens opened at the baptisyng of Christe, the voyce of the father was hearde, and the holy ghoste was seen in the lykenesse of a doue: whyche thynges did not happen at the i

of wyne should so growe & multiplie by hys steightes of iugleyng, that all the wholle cuppe should bee full to the veray brymme, yea and renne ouer too.
            Yea and whan an other bigger cuppe was brought vnto hym that would hold more in it: thys Marcus would so hādle ye matier that the bigger cuppe should bee full too, wythoute puttyng of any more liquour vnto it then was afore. What man would saye that thys felowes was euer the more approued or confirmed by these miracles? If we will come to the stories of the Gentiles, we reade that there hath riuers and streames of bloud renne along vpon the grounde,Certain miracles wrought by Ethnites & Gentiles. and that Iuppiters thumbe hath spinned out with bloud. Liuius telleth that in Rome our time it did 
                  •
               aine flesh. Quintus Curtius reporteth that at the citee of Tyrus whan it was besieged of Alexander the great, a lofe of breade did openly in the syght of them all sweat out and droppe bloud whan one of Alexanders soldyars cutte the lofe And Apollonius Thyraneus is reported yt whā he was at the parliamente before Domitianus the Emperour, he vanished away sodeynly, and could no more bee found.
            Thus there bee miracles and woondres infinite which the Gentiles myght in this case bryng in to confirme theyr worshyppyng of Idolles. And therefore all suche miracles as these men affirme to make for the confirmyng and establishyng the supersticion of transubstanciacion, we vtterly reiecte and dissallow.
            Neither is it muche to bee regarded, that they bring in for this purpose, of a miracle showed of Gregorie

byshop of Rome.
            For it is wryten in hys life, that the lordes breade, or (if ye wyll so calle it) the sacramente of Eucharistia, was turned into a finger of fleashe.
            Whyche thyng if it wer so dooen for either of the two causes whiche (as aboue sayd) we dooe receiue, there is no great earnest strife to bee made for the matier.
            Albeeit that same life of Gregorie is a matier of no great weyght or force to bee passed on.
            For if we wyll beleue Uincentius the said life of Gregorius was wryten an hundred yeres after he was dead of our Ihon of Rome a deacon, and sent to a certan Emperour beeyng a Germain.
            But putte the case that it was so in ded. If our aduersaries wyll therof conclude by the shewyng of the finger of fleashe, that the fleashe of Christe dooeth corporally and bodyly lye hidden vnder the accidētes of the breade than myght a bodye by this kynde of miracles conclude, that vnder the sacramentall similitudes and signes there is bothe coles and ashes conteined, because that thys holy breade was ones turned into these thinges in Cyprians tyme, (as hymself wryteth:) I beleue also that the sleightes and illusions of vyle lewd felowes are not vnknowen, whyche they haue often tymes vsed to deuise and inuente miracles.
            In an other argumente they layed veray sore to our charge the dignitee and excellencie of Christes bodye glorified, whyche from the tyme of hys resurrection foorth ward is called hys bodye spiritual, whiche dignitee and excellencie of Christes bodye glorified we dooe in no wyse denye.
            
               Yet wyll we putte you in remembraunce of that that Austen hath in an epistle to one Cōsētius, where Austē affirmeth that Christes bodye glorified is not after suche sorte a spiritual bodye, that it passeth into the nature of a spirite. For a certain kynde of bodye there is, whyche of S. Paule in the fifteenth chapitur of hys former epistle to the Corinthians is called Corpus animale,
               Corpus animale. as if ye should saye in englyshe, a bodye en

But the sayd place of S. Paule where

                  te dei, that is to saye, of the citee of god, wryteth in thys manier. The solle sometymes, whyle it foloweth the appetite of the fleashe, is called carnal and fleashely not y• it is chaunged into the nature of fleashe: euen so the bodye is called spiritual, not because it is chaunged into the nature of the spirite, but because it wyll bee altogether obedient to the spirite, to fulfille the desire & wille of the spirite. And Hierome in an epistle to Pammachius, whyche epistle was made in defense of the trueth agaynst Ihon the bishop of Hierusalem, who sayeth that the solles of suche as arose, had euery one of thē a bodye of ayer, whiche was not subiect neyther

to touchyng nor to the syght, and Hierome (I saye) in thys epystle dooeth by all possible meanes contente to proue, that Christe after hys resurrection had a veray true bodye in dede, and the same also visible. And Hierome aunswereth to an obiection whyche obiectiō was thys: If Christes bodye after hys resurrection was in suche sorte visible and was the same veray bodye that he had whan he was aliue afore:Luke. xxiiii. Wherefore was it not knowe
                  •
                at what tyme he shewed hymself lyke a pilgryme to the two disciples goyng to the castle of Emaus? To this doeth Hierome thus make aunswer. Because theyr yies wer holden, that they should not knowe hym: as if he should haue sayed: as touchyng the nature of hys bodye, it was bothe visible, & myght haue been knowen: but the lette yt was, was in thesame veray epistle to the Corinthiās. Yet neuerthelesse our sacramentes haue many prerogatiues and many poyntes of dignite aboue the sacramentes of the olde lawe. For fyrst and formoste they bee firme and stable, and shall no more bee chaunged vnto the worldes ende: secondly they dooe not shewe of a thyng that is to bee dooen and yet to come, but of a thyng dooen alreadie. Our sacramentes also bee more simple and plain, and they perteine to a larger and a greatter noumbre of people. And forasmuche as they bee more clere & open then ye olde sacramentes, they stiere vp in vs a greatter feith, and therof foloweth a more plenteous aboundance of the spirite. And that they bee more clere and open dooeth not procede (as the aduersaries imagyn to theymselfes in theyr braines) of the outward prefiguracion of the

               ignes, because that the same is more euident then the old was: but of the nature of ye woordes

that are there ꝓnounced. For by the said woordes our redēptiō is shewed to bee perfeict, & it is shewed with more clere & more open wordes, then the common sorte of people emong the fathers of the old lawe did vnderstāde. Than if the thyng bee more clere expouned and declared in woordes: the outward represētacion is not so greatly to bee regarded.Wh

And leat these men (I beseche you) tell vs: what manier of Churche, and in what state did Christe fynde the churche at hys fyrst cōmyng? Had not ye Scribes, the Pharisees, the Priestes, and the Bishops corrupted all together? had they not peruerted all true religion wyth theyr tradiciōs? Yet is it not to bee thought that the Churche hath at any time been vtterly forsakē or leaft in errour. For there hath been euermore from tyme to tyme many good people, wh
                  •
                this geare hath muche myslyked, & that haue openly cryed out against it. And lyke as at hys fyrst cōmyng there was Symeō Anne the wedowe, Ioseph, and the virgin Marie, Elizabeth, & Ihon the Baptiste, whiche wer godly folkes

& deuout, and had special good opinion of god, so that the Churche could not bee saied to bee vtterly forsakē: euen so hath it been dooen in these last tymes. For the wholle vniuersal Curche is not leauened wyth tradicions of men. They saye morouer that as touchyng that it is ordeined but to signifie & betokē, the selfsame betokenyng maye bee dooen by breade and wyne at al meates whan men dyne and suppe, and therefore no cause to bee, why we should so hyghly esteme the sacrament of Eucharistia But thys argumente is as weake and as feble an argumente as is possible to bee. For at cōmon repastes there is not the lordes institucion, there is no ordeinaunce of a sacramente, there is not heard the lordes woordes, nor there is not there any promisse of god: therefore bee not these twoo to bee compared together. Lastely there was an argument brought of the vertue and efficacie of goddes woorde, whyche (as Algerius citeth and allegeth in the seuenth chapitur of his first booke) is called of Ambrose uerbum operatorium as if ye should saye in englishe a word of workyng & of operaciō, as by the whiche worde the breade & wyne whiche remaine stil in their natures are yet neuerthelesse chaunged into another thyng. But as touchyng the woordes of Ambrose we accepte them with good wille. For we also putte that ye breade & the wyne dooe remaine stil in their owne natures, not (as the trāsubstāciatours affirme) as touchyng the accidētes, or the lykenesses & fourmes of breade & wyne, so yt ye chaūge is made by alteraciō & remouyng away of the substaunce: but that we affirme & aduouche the propre natures of breade & wyne to bee kept still, & the haungyng to bee onely sacramental through grace.
            
               And in thys our assercion we dooe nothyng derogate or diminishe frō the efficacie of the lordes woordes: but yet we dooe not thynke that it is to attributed vnto them as to a kynde of enchauntimente or coniu

               yng, that how soeuer, or in what soeuer place they bee pronounced by a prieste or ministre ouer breade & wine wyth a mynde and intencion to consecrate, they shal by and by haue that effecte. For the wholle matier depē
               deth of ye lordes instituciō, & of the action or workyng of the holy ghoste. Now as for Algerius he is a man not muche to bee passed on for he was after the tyme of Berengarius, & maketh mencion of Berengarius 
                  •
               ecantacion in hys wrytyng. Than morouer of what a great and good iudgemente he was, it is manifest of a certain argumente that he maketh. For in the one and twenteeth chapitur of hys fyrst boke he wyllyng and labouryng to proue yt aswel the godly as the vngodly dooe receiue Christes bodye in the sacramente, (whyche in dede foloweth necessaryly if there wer a transubstanciacion:) take a similitude (sayeth he) of the outward voyce or woorde that a man dooeth speake, & of talke that is made by sounde of the ayer. Unto what soeuer persones suche woordes dooe come, it conteineth and hath wyth it hys owne propre sense and menyng. But if it come to men of good vnderstādyng, thesame dooe heare it wyth some profit, for they dooe well perceiue the thynges that are spoken. But in case it come to the vnlearned, and to men that lacke knowelage, it dooeth neuerthelesse beare wyth it the ꝓpre sense of the wordes, but yet it is wythout any profit to the hearer, because he is not a man of capacitee to vnderstande it. Thys man lacketh here for hys argumente ye woordes

beare theyr sense and menyng wyth thē: but he dooeth not marke that the sense is not included or enwrapped really (as the terme is) in the sonne or in the caractes of the lettres, but onely by the waye of signifiyng. Whyche self same thyng if it should bee sayed vnto hym of the breade and the wyne in the sacramentes, that they offre vnto vs the bodye of Christe by the waye of signifiyng or betokenyng & none other wyse: he shal bee conuinced in hys owne similitude and comparison. And by thesame also it is proued that the wyeked dooe not receiue the lordes bodye, euen lyke as vnskilful or ignoraunt persones whan they heare talke in greke or latin, dooe not perceiue the sense and menyng therof. Wherupon conclude, that there could not any thyng haue been spoken more strongly on our syde thē thys similitude of Algerius. Thesame Algerius also in the fyrst chapitur of the second booke aduoucheth that the accidentes in thys sacramente dooe not veraily and truely susteme rottenesse or mouldryng away, but onely that it so appereth vnto vs, and yet is not so in dede, whyche thyng euen the veray scholemen would not haue sayed. For what other thyng is thys, but to establishe a perpetual illusion and blyndyng of mannes senses? Thus than we nede not muche to passe of Algerius, though he labour by all meanes possible to ratifie and sette vp hys transubstanciacion. We haue now traicted of the fyrst opinion, and that at large. For the sayd opinion of transubstanciacion remoued and taken away, there shall there wyth also many supersticions bee taken away. Of the other twoo opinions we shal not talke so muche at length. For whether of thē bothe bee putte or affirmed, we doee not so greatly

passe, so that it bee well vnderstanded as it should bee. We shall at thys present onely shewe of them, as ferre as we maye see ī it what we iudge mete to bee eschewed or to bee receiued in either of them. There haue been many whiche haue reteined and kept still in the sacramente the substance of breade and wyne, but they haue ioygned the bodye & bloud of Christe wyth these materiall signes remainyng still in theyr owne natures: & these haue they ioygned together with a veray streight and fast knotte, but yet (as I trow) not in suche sorte, that of ye boke beeyng so ioygned together there should bee made one substaunce or one nature.

               Yet neuerthelesse they haue sayed that the bodye and bloud of Christe are present in the breade & wyne really (as they terme it) bodyly, and naturali.
            Some others again haue ioygned them together onely by the waye of betokenyng. Of these twoo determinacions the former is fathered vpon Luther, & the later vpon zwynglius:Of the conte

Yea & zwynglius again on ye other syde feared lesce Luther would putte suche thynges as might bothe bee derogatiue & preiudicial

            These persones whiche dooe so grossely ioygne the bodye of Christe wyth the outward and material signes: to the ende that they maye the better wynde out of all entangleynges, are woont to beyng in for theyr purpose two similitudes or comparisons.

               For whan they shewe the thyng whyche theimselfes suppose to bee compouned, that is to saye, made of two sondrie partes (as in thys sacrament of breade and of Christes bodye. &c.) it is not a true proposicion or clause, to saye: Thys is the bodye of Christe, but as touchyng the one parte of the thyng that is shewed forth in syght. Yet neuerthelesse it is to bee knowen, that these similitudes or comparisons are not taken of these men, as though they wer of the opinion, that they dooe in all pointes or all manier of wayes agree wyth the thyng that the comparison is made by: for theimselfes dooe earnestely affirme and reasō that Christe is not th

               re present locallye, that is to saye, after suche sorte as thynges are commonly in places conuenient for theyr likenesse and quantitee: but onely diffinitiuely, that is to saye, by the waye of determinacion and assignemente, whyche they vnderstande than to bee so, whan a thyng is encompaced wyth the measure and largenesse of a place aunswerable in all pointes to hys likenesse, but yet it is sayed to bee there, because the nature or the beeyng of it is for that present deputed & assigned to ye place, or because it woorketh and hath hys operacion in that place: whyche propretee dooeth nothyng at all agree wyth the wyne in a potte: for there it hath hys ful place and ful roome wyth whyche it is encoumpaced. Besides thys, these men woul not saye that Christes bodye is so in the breade, that it maye haue hys name of the qualitees or accidentes of the breade. For the bodye of Christe beeyng in the cake of breade can not truely bee called whyte, round, or baked, whyche thyng neuerthelesse we see chaunce vnto fyer that is entremiengled wyth read

glowing yron. For the fyer that is in hoate glowing yrō doth so folow the facion of the yron as for exaumple the lengthe, the bredthe, and the thyckenesse of it, that it maye well be named of suche facion or shape as ye yron hath. Wherby it do manifestly appere, these similitudes in this sentence and opinion not to bee taken of these men so as it maye be applyed to aunswere and agree in all poyntes: but onely that a true and a reall coniunction of the Sacrament and of the thyng signifyed by the sacramente maye be shewed and proued: whiche as soone as it is graunted, it foloweth by and by, that aswell the godly as the wieked sorte do receiue Christes bodye. The first that is that the godly do receyue Christes bodye, because they thynke this real coniunction of Christes bodye and the sacrament to bee sufficiently proued by the lordes woordes: the secounde, that is, that the bodye of Christ is geuen to the wieked also, aswell as to the godly, they see to folowe necessarily. But we haue now alreadye shewed the contrarie, whiche is, that these wordes of Christe dooe not necessarilye dryue or leade vs to anye suche se
                  •
               se: and it is proued by effectuall and pitthy reasons that the wieked dooe receyue onely the elementes, that is to saye, the outwarde and materyall signes, as breade and wyne and nothyng els.
            These menne are woont also thus to argue: If the woordes of scripture bee taken as figuratiuelye spoken: than maye it easely be brought to passe, that many preceptes of the lawe maye bee subuerted and fordoen.Gene. xvi. For Abraham might haue sayed of circumcision whan it was commannded: This is a figuratiue manier of speakyng, and I shall fulfyll and satisfie

this commaundement yf I circumcise my hert, & cutte awai the eiuel desires and vices of ye fleash. Also whā the choice of meates was commaūded,Leut. xi. the Isralites might haue said that the execucion of that commaundemente might consiste in a morall obseruacion or keping of it: as if thei did not cōmitte those synnes which wer assigned and noted to be in these vnclene beastes yt wer for bidden thē,Whether tropes dooe empeache ye commaūndementes of God. and so neither circumcision nor the choice or deuersytee of meates had taken place. But yt this a feble reason, maie herof be wel proued, because that by veray the lettre self, and bi the expresse wordes of the text, it is euidently to be gathered that the wordes are not spoken by any trope or figure.
            For as concernynge circumcision, the eighte daye from the childes byrth was determinately and precysely appointed, and there is added that ye league and couenaunte of the lorde should bee carryed of them in the verai fleashe selfe, by whiche woordes it is euydent that verai true circumcision in dede was commaunded. And as touchynge the choice or dyfference of meates, the condycions of the beastes there mencyoned aswell the clene as the vnclene, are so playnly and expressely described, and concernynge the transgressours of that commaundemente, there is an ordre of puryfiynge them so dystinctely and plainly sette oute, that there is no place leafte of doubtynge or mystakynge of it.
            
               Austēs rule how to take the woordes or the letter of the holye scripture.We haue also Austens rule of christen doctryne whereby he sheweth that vnlesse the woordes seme to commaunde any vndecente or wyeked thynge, or els to forbid some good worke, it must be taken as the lettre goeth without any trope or figure.
            
               Whiche rule yf it be laied to the meates and to circuncision: it shall declare that the woordes of God are to bee taken simplye and plainly as they sounde wythout any figure. They allege morouer that in the prophetes and in the histories there bee tropes and figures easie and readie to bee admitted because that in them the holy ghoste fareth after the manier of menne, and dooeth accomidate him selfe to the famylier mannier of speakyng that men vse, to thentente he maie the more vehemently and the better expresse the thynges that are to bee spoken: but in doctrines and in preceptes or rules it maie not so bee.
            For there say they must all thynges bee taken simply and plainly as the wordes soūd, without any ferther addicion or circumstaunce.
            But this sentence of theirs is not firme and sure, no nor yet vniuersall. For as touchynge preceptes and lessons geuynge, the lord sayeth: Take hede and beware of the leauen of the pharisees. &c. where he dooeth moste manifestlye vse a trope and a fygure of speakynge, yea and suche an one, that the Apostles selfes were there ouerseene in takynge and vnderstanding of it. He cōmaunded moreouer in the seuenteenth chapytur of Mathewe they should beware of false Prophetes for, (sayed he) they shall come vnto you in shepes clothing but īwardly they are rauenynge woulfes. &c. In whiche precepte who perceyueth not a plain fyguratyue speche? And in geuynge of doctrynes also and in structions, there is no doubte, but that tropes and fygures are vsed.
            
               Paule sayeth in the newe testamente, The stone was Chryste: We are one breade: and of God it is wryten, that he is a burnyge fyer,
            
               whether the bodye of Christe bee eue
                     •
                  y wher or not.After thys they contende that the bodye of Christ may be in all places & that by the woordes of Christ to Necodeme in the thyrde chapitur of Iohn, where it is sayed: No man ascendeth vp into heauē but he that came downe frome heauen, that is to saye, the Sonne of man, which is in heauen. Be holde (say they) the sonne of man that is to saye, Chryste, euen in hys humanite talked wyth theym, and yet was in heauen too. For hys humayn nature cannot bee seperated frome the deuyne nature of hys godhed: therefore wha
                  •
               soeuer is affirmed of the one, muste in lyke manyer bee veryfied of the other. But thys is our aunswer, that we goo not a bout in any wyse to deuide these twoo natures the one from the other, but yet it foloweth not, that what soeuer is verified and truelye saied of the one, oughte also to bee attributed to the other. Thys wyll we graunte wyth a good will, that the diuyne nature & godhede of Chryste is euery where: Yet will we not attribute the same to hys bodye in hys humanytee. And this dooeth Austen moste plainly teache in an epistle of his to one Dardanus And as touching that whyche is alleged out of the thyrde chapitur of Iohn, the same Austen dooeth interprete and expoune it, yt it must be vnderstanded of his deuine nature, that the soonne of man was in heauen. Neither dooeth Chrysostome take it any other wyse whan he expoundeth

thys place. For he affyrmeth that to bee in heauē is not alttributed vnto the sonne of man but according to this most excellent nature of the godhed. But how weake thys argumente is, that these twoo natures are ioygned together: ergo what so euer is graunted to the one, must olso bee altributed to the other: maye bee well shewed and proued by other argumentes. The bodye or balle of the sunne that shyneth in the skye, & the lyght of the same sunne haue betwene them selues a naturall and a moste high coniunctyon: and yet the same bodye of the sunne dooeth not really and verayly reache to al places that ye light dothe extende it self vnto. Item the bodye or substaunce of our yie and the sight of thesame are verai nere coupled and knitte together: and yet for al that our sight cometh and reacheth to many thynges, whyche our bodily yie doeth not extende it self vnto Thei argue furthermore yt many thinges ought to be geuen, graunted, & attributed to the body of Chryste a boue the cōmon course & cōdyciōs of other bodies. And yt for two causes, partely because it is glorified, & partely for yt it hath ye word ioygned vnto it For aunswer wherof we confesse yt many thīges must be attributed & confessed of it: but as for this, yt it should be euery wher, can not bee attributed vnto it wythout preiudice of the nature of a true humayn and naturall bodye. And in case we shoulde graunte somuche vnto Chrystes humayn bodye it should not make fore hys dygnytee, but rather quyte and clene to the derogacyon and destructyon of it: For than shoulde he bee as it wer thruste oute, and depriued frō his true nature. Furthermore thissame coulde make but litle for our aduersaires purpose in this matier.

For although we should graūt that the body of Christe might haue this prerogatiue to bee in manye places at once. Yet shoulde it not folow that God wil so doe in this sacrament. Yet ferther they laboure and trauaile to proue this corporall presence of Christe in the Sacrament by the similitude of a teacher that readeth a lecture to an audience: who in that that he maie extende his woordes to many hearers, doeth also in thē cōmunicate and vtter vnto all his hearers and audience all that lyeth in his mynde to vtter vnto them so that all the sayde audience euery one of them maye fully and perfectly vnderstande the botome of his hert as well one as another. In lyke manier (say they) doeth our lorde in the wordes that are pronounced ouer the Sacrament.
            He dooeth (as it were) enwrappe his bodye in them, that by the same it maye be conueyghed vnto all those signes or cakes of breade, and maye so bee communicated and distributed vnto all the receyuers thereof, howe manye soeuer bee of them.
            If therefore suche a gyfte or power (saye they) bee geuen and graunted to a scholemaister, or a preacher beyng but an yearthly and a mortall man: why shall not thesame bee muche more geuen to Christe? But in this comparison is a righte greate dyuersitie. & oddes. And besides yt also (as we haue sayed) before the woordes dooe not carye nor conueyghe thynges nor dooe not conueyghe the conceites of the mynde to the hearers, but onely by the waye of signifyinge and betokenyng.
            And where as they goe aboute afterwardes to establishe and confyrme that the bodye of Christe is

in all places by the fyrste chapitur of the Epistle to the Ephesians, where it is sayed that Christ is made the heade of the Churche whiche is his body & the fulnesse of him that fylleth all in all thinges.The Greke wordes bee 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . &c. is of no force at all to this purpose. For there it is not signifyed ne ment that the bodye of Christe filleth all thynges, and is in all places as they doe bryng in and conclude vpon it. But because the significaciō of this Greke word or participle 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                is indifferente to bee taken twoo manier of wayes, (for it is a verbe common (as the Gramarians call it,) that is to say, of suche nature, that it may signifye eyther dooyng or sufferyng (as ye lust.) For ye maye chose whether ye will take it and Englishe it, fillyng, or els beyng fylled: If ye Englishe it, beynge fylled: than shall the sense and menyng of it bee, that Christe beeyng the heade of the churche, is in his membres made full and perfect in all poyntes: not that he is made perfecte on his owne behalfe, (for he is bothe perfeicte and full enough as touchyng hymselfe) but it is to be vnderstanded that he is fulfylled and made perfeyct as touchyng vs that are his bodye, and his membres. For as the heade is cōpared vnto Christe, & he called the heade: euen so is the congregation called the fulnesse of Christe because it fulfylleth and maketh vp his mysticall body. But if ye Englishe it fyllynge: than shall the sense bee, that Christe is the heade of his Chuche, because he fylleth and maketh perfeicte his gyftes & vertues in all his membres. Neyther can the sense bee that he is in all places after his humanitee. And I thynke that the same maye well be proued by the scriptures.
            
               For Christe dooeth manifeste saye and graunte that Lazarus dyed while he was absente from thence. That yf the aduersaries wyll contende that he hadde not at that tyme a glorifyed bodye:Chris
                     •
                   as touchinge his manhoode, is not in euery place. it maketh not muche to the matier. For he had neuerthelesse the god head ioygned vnto his bodye. But to putte the mattier out of all doubtes, the Aungell euen after his resurrection sayed vnto the weomen: he is arisen, he is not here. And agayne he shall goo before you into Galilee. And agayn: he was taken vp out of their sight whan he ascended into heauen. Therfore he filleth not all thynges, neither is he in al places after his humanitee. Thei are woont also to allege a place out of the fourth chaptur to the Ephesians. He that came downe is euen the same also that ascēded vp euen aboue all heauens to fullyll all thynges. Which place for all that proueth nothyng agaynst vs, and it is exponnded two manier of wayes. Fyrste that to fulfyll all thynges bee referred to al those thynges which were prophecied and wryten of Christe, whereof a litell before he rehearsed a scripture saying: he is gon vp on high, and hath led captiuitie captiue, and hath geuen giftes vnto menne. And yf ye wyl referre it to places than ye must vnderstande it of certayne kyndes of places, and not of euery singuler place according as this saying here folowyng is spoken. the lorde will haue all men to be saued. Therfore we muste saye that Christe sō
               tyme hath occupyed the middle partes, sometyme the

vpper partes and sometyme the lowest partes, in the sepulchre. But now the transubstanciatours saie that they haue nothynge to dooe here wythall. For they saye not that the bodye of Chryste is euerye where, but onely he that is in al places where this sacrament is. Howbeit it is agaynst theym neuerthelesse. For yf it so bee (as they affirme,) that it is not repugnant to the bodye of Chryste to bee at one tyme in the twentie or fiftie sōdry places at once:If Christes bodye maye bee in many places at once than it maye bee in euery place whiche also D
                     ••
                  us perceiued ynough. than shal it not be repugnant for the same body to bee in an houndreth places, or in a thousande, and consequentlye in all places, and so shall they make Chrystes bodye to bee infynite. Neither can thei well fynde faulte with this manyer of arguynge or reasoninge as though this fourme of arguyng were not good. For Hierome vseth euen the same manier of resonyng against Iohn the byshop of Hierusalem, where he mindeth to proue that oure bodyes after the resurrection maie endewe without fode. For (sayth he) Helias and Moses could by the power of God continue without meate by the space of fowertie dayes: therfor maie an other man by thesame power of God bee susteyneth longer. And yf he may continue longer: than it foloweth, that he may continue alwaies if it bee the wyll of God that he shall so dooe. But leat vs returne again to our aduersaires the transubstanciatours They because they se that vpon this so nere a coniunction or couplyng together of Christe with the sacramente, it foloweth that the same sacramente maye bee wurshypped: (For yf the lorde bether conteined really & corporalli, what his he that woulde not wurshyp hym? (they teache that we maie indi

               ferently at our pleasures either doe it, or leaue it vndoē.
            
               For (saye they) although he bee there in dede yet is he not there to any suche ende or purpose that he shoulde bee wurshipped. If ye take and eate the Sacramente, it is enoughe yf ye dooe also wurship it, ye dooe not amisse. But that that we putte of the Sacramentes is a thynge of more certainetee, whiche is, that in oure wurshippinge we maye not directe our mynde towardes the outewarde signes: but yf any manne at the tyme of the ministracion of the sacramente beeyng well and rightly instructed afore of this mysterie directe his mynde to wurshippe Christe reygning in heauen: he dooeth well, yea, he is bounde to wurshippe Christe who declareth himselfe vnto him. Neither is there any Idolatry committed in so dooyng, as Paule teacheth in the Epistle to the Corinthians whan he sayeth: If anye man come into youre congregacion beeyng an ignoraunt & vnlearned person, and heareth you altogether speake with tongues: vndoubtedly (wil he saie) these felowes are all out of their wittes, neither shal he be any thyng edifyed. But if he heare you proph

               cieng and perceyue that the secretes of his herte are opened, than will he fal downe on his face, and worship god.
            He wyll not in this case wurshyp the men that so prophecie or preyche: but for asmuche as the lorde doth there open hym selfe vnto him he will turne hym selfe to wurshyp God.

Also ouer and aboue that spirytuall eatyng whyche wee haue in the Syxte Chapiter of Iohn,The fourth they brynge in an other fleshely and bodelye eatynge of Christe, whiche can not bee proued: whereas thys and y• other are but all one, sauynge that in the latter there bee added outward material signes to confyrme the thyng so muche the better.
            Also it shoulde folowe that whyle thei yeld so muche vnto the woordes and ye letter,The fifthe. they wade in ye same dificultee and hardenese, that ye transubstancyatours are entangled wyth all, whan they saye: Thys is my bodye.

For what manier of bodye there is in the sacramente of Eucharistia, Ciprian declareth it in hys sermon of the lordes Supper whan he sayeth:Cyprian. who continually euen vnto this present daye dooeth create, sanctyfie, and blesse his bodye, distributynge thesame to the godly receauers. Now Christes verai owne propre bodye is not of newe created, nor sanctified, nor deuyded.Chrisostome Chrisostome vpon the fifth chapitur of Matthew in the eleuenth homely of his work that is called vnperfecte hath these woordes: If therfore it be so daungerous a thynge to remoue and applye to pryuate vses and occupynge these halowed vesseles in the whyche is not the veray true bodye of Chryste

but onely the mistery of his bodye conteined. &c. And howe we ought to clyme vp into heauen, when we do receyue the communion, if we wyll haue the fruicion of Christes bodye, thesame Chrysostome dooeth also expounde in his fower and twentieth homilie vpon the fyrste Epistle to the Corinthians and the tenthe chapitur where he thus sayeth: he geueth a commaū

For (sayth he) whersoeuer the carkesse is, there wyll the Eagles be also. The lorde he calleth a carkesse, because of his death. For vnlesse he had dyed, we should not haue arisen agayn. And he calleth vs Eagles to shew that whosoeuer commeth to this body, must earnestly endeuour to clyme vp on high, and muste haue no felowshyp with the yearthe, nor bee drawen to the thynges that are beneth, as it were one styll crepyng by the grounde: but that he must alwayes flighe vp to the thynges that be aboue and must beholde the sunne of righteousnesse, and also muste haue the yie of the hert most sharpe and quicke. For this is a table for mounting Eagles, and not for pratlyng Iaies.

Austen vnto Bonifacius hath all these thynges after thesame ordre & tenour, saying: ye tyme of Ester drawyng nigh, we saye: thys daye, or the daye after to morowe, did Christ dye. On the sondaie we saie: Thys daye arose Chryste from death. And, Baptisme is feith, and, the sacramente of the bodye of Chryste is Chrystes bodye.
            
               The thinge that is absente is spoken of the thing presētWe see that in all these forsayde saiynges, the thynge absente is really spoken of the thinge presente. The same Austen vpon the fifty fowerth psalme: The head was in heauen and sayed: why dooest thou persecute me? we are in heauen wyth hym thoroughe hope, and he is in yearth wyth vs thorough loue.
            And in ye hundreth and nyneteenth epystle to Ianuaryus: Wherfore did he vnto that persecutour whome he threwe downe wyth hys voice, and did in amanier eate hym transportynge hym into hys bodye.
            Wherfore (I saie) dyd he to that persecutour calle down from heauen, and saye: Saule Saule why dooest thou persecute me? &c.

            For the lordes bodye whereyn he arose muste nedes bee in one place: But his trueth is dyspersed, and spred abrode in all places.
            
               Item vpon Iohn in the fiftyeth treactise, thus he sayeth: For after hys maiestee after his prouidence, after hys vnspeakeable and inuisible grace it is fulfyl ledde that was spoken of hym: Beholde I am wyth you vnto the worldes ende: But after the fleashe whyche the woorde tooke vpon him accordynge to hys beeyng borne of the virgyn as touchynge hys beeynge taken of the Iewes, beeynge nailled vpon the tree, beeynge taken down frome the crosse, beeynge wrapped in lynnen clothes, beeynge layed in the sepulchre, and as touchynge that he was manifested and did plainly appere after his resurreccion, it is fulfylled that he saied: Ye shall not haue me alwayes presente with you.
            Wherfore, because he was conuersaunt in hys bodyly presence by the space of fowertye dayes wyth his disciples, and they awaiting vpon hym (by seyng him, but not by folowing him) he ascēded vp into heauen: bothe true it is that he is not here, (for he sitteth there on the right hāde of his father) & also yt he is presēt there, for he is not gone awai with ye presēce of his maieste. Otherwise, after ye presēce of his maieste we haue christ alwais with vs: & after the presēce of his fleash it was rightly said of him to his disciples: But as for me ye shal not alwayes haue with you.
            
               For the Churche had hym after the presence of the fleashe but a few dayes: now it holdethe and hathe him styll throughe seithe, but with the bodelye yies it seethe hym not.

                  amine this place by Austēs workes. And thesame Austen agayne vpō ye Epistle of Iohn wel toward the ende of the epistle: Therfore our Lord Iesus Christ did for this cause ascend into heauen, because he sawe, that many would honour him: and he sawe that their honouryng of hym is vnprofitable vnto them, if they trample and trede his membres on yearth.

               nte that no man should erre, and whan he wurshipped the head in heauē, he should trede the feete on yearth: he tolde where his membres should be. For he spake his last woordes euen whan he was readye to ascende vp into heauen: and after the same woordes he spake nomore vpon yearth. The head beeyng about to ascēd vp to heauen commended his membres on yearth. Thou fyndest hym to speake, but it is in heauen, & down from heauen. And why? because his membres wer troden vpon yearth. For vnto Paule beyng a persecutour of hym, he saied frō aboue:

Saule, Saule, why dooest thou persecut me? I am ascended vp into heauen, but I doe yet styl lie as an abiect on the earth I sitte here at the right hande of my father, but there on yearth I dooe yet still houngre, & thirst, and am as a straungier How than did he commande his bodie on yearth whā he was about to ascēde vp to heauē? Whan hys disciples demaunded of hym: lorde, wylt thou at this tyme restore the kyngdome of Israel? And he beeyng euē at the veray point to bee gon frō theim, thus aunswered: It belongeth not to you to knowe the tymes, whiche the father hath putte in hys owne power.

And the same Cyrillus in ye nynth boke vpō Ihon & ye .xxi. chap. Christe sayed that he would bee wyth hys disciples but a litell space, not because he should goe from them altogether, (for he is still wyth vs continually vntyll the ende of the worlde:) but because he should not liue nor bee cōuersaunt wyth theym, as he had been before. For the tyme was now at hande that he should departe away from them vp to heauē vnto his father. And the parte of al feythfull is to beleue, that although he bee absent from vs in bodye, yet neu

               sent wyth all them that loue hym. And therefore it was that he sayed.
            Uerayly verayly I saye vnto you, wheresoeuer there shall bee two or three gathered together in my name: there am I in the middes of them. For lyke as euen at that tyme whan he was conuersaunt on yearth as a

man, he did also fyl heauen, and forsoke not the coumpaignie of the Aungels: euen so at this present though he bee in heauen wyth hys fleashe, ye the fulfilleth the yearth & is psēt with thē that loue hym. And it is to bee marked, y• although he should goe away after hys fleash onely (for as we haue alreadie saied, he is continually psent wyth vs by ye vertue of hys godhed:) yet he sayed that he would for a litell space remaine wyth hys disciples namyng hymself in plain woordes because no mā should presume to deuide Christe into twoo sonnes.
            And wyth these men agreeth Uigilius, who in the fyrst booke against Eutiches wryteth in thys manier. The sonne of god after hys humanitee departed away from vs: but after hys godhed he sayeth vnto vs. Beholde, I am wyth you vntyl the ende of the worlde. And the same man not many lines a
                  •
               ter sayeth: For whom he leaft and from he departed in hys humanitee, theym hath he not leaft nor forsaken in hys godhed. For after the fourme and shape of a seruaunte or bondeman whyche he tooke away from vs into heauen, he is absent frō vs: but after the fourine & shape of god he goeth not away frō vs, but he is psent wyth is euen vpon yearth. And yet aswell beeyng present as absent he is one & the same vnto vs. Again in the fowerth boke: If the nature of the woorde & of the fleashe bee but one nature: how happeneth that wheras the woorde is euery where, ye fleashe also is not found euery where? For whā he was on yearth, certes he was not in heauen, and now, because he is in heauen, certes he is not on yearth. And so ferreforth is he not on yearth, that as touchyng the fleashe we looke for Christ to come down frō heauen whom after the word, we beleue to bee wyth vs vpon yearth.
            
               Therefore after your opinion, eyther the woorde is conteined and encoumpaced in some certain place together wyth hys fleashe: or els the fleashe is euery where together wyth ye woorde. For one nature dooeth not receiue in it self any thyng that is contrarie to it, or of a sondrie sorte from it. And of a muche sondrie sorte and ferre vnlyke bee these two th

               nges, to bee encompaced or conteined in a determinat place, and to bee euery where. And forasmuche as the woorde is euerywhere, and his fleashe is not euery where: it appereth that one & the same Christe is of bothe natures, and that he is in veray dede euery where after the nature of hys godhed, and to bee conteined wythin the circuit of a place after the nature of hys humanitee and manhoed and also that created he was, and yet hath no begynnyng: and to bee subiect to death, & yet of suche immortalitee that he can not die. And within fewe lines after thus he sayeth: This is the catholike feith and confession, whyche the Apostles taught and deliuered, whyche the Martirs confirmed and whiche the feithful dooe kepe and holde euen vnto thys present. Besides these also Fulgētius vnto kyng Trasinnudus in the second book:

Whiche thyng maie by the moste true and assured woordes of the lordes self bee knowen, who to shewe hys humanitee placeable, saied vnto his disciples: I goe vp vnto my father and your father, my god and your god. Also whan he had saied of Lazarus: Lazarus is dead, he added thereto, and saied: I am glad for your sakes, that ye maye beleue, because I was not there. And to declare the infinitenesse of his godhed, he saieth vnto his disciples: Beholde I am with you al the daies vntil the consummacion of the worlde. How did he ascende vp into heauen, but that he is a veray man in dede & placeable? Or how is he present wyth his feithfull, but that he is veray true god in dede and infinite? And the same fulgentius in ye third booke: Christe beeyng one and inseparable, did after hys onely fleashe aryse out of the sepulchre: and thesame Christe beeyng one and inseparable, did after the wholle and perfeict nature of man whyche he tooke vpon hym

                forsake the yearth locally, and ascended vp into heauen, and sitteth on the right hande of god, and after the self same wholle and perfeict man he shall come to iudge the quicke and the dead, and to croune the feithfull and godly. Finally Bernard vpō the cāticles of Salomon in the three and thirtieth sermō thus sayeth:Bernarde. I also haue the woorde, but in fleashe I haue it, and the trueth is sette afore me, but it is in a sacramente. The aungel is fatte fed with the fatte of the wheate and is now saciated and filled wyth the graine self and I must in the meane whyle

bee contented wyth a certain rynde of the sacrament, wyth the branne of the fleshe, wyth the chaffe of ye lettre wyth the vaylle of feyth. And these thynges are of suche sorte, that beeyng tasted of they bryng death, vnleste thei haue takē some sawce bee it neuer so litel of y•

                except it bee swetened wt the mele of the ꝓphete. And within a litel after, he sayeth: But wt how great aboundaunce soeuer these thynges growe in fatnesse, yet dooe not we wyth lyke pleasauntenesse receyue the rynde of the sacramente, and the fatnesse of the wheate self: feyth and hope: remembrance of a thyng, and the presence of the same euerlastyngnesse, & transitorinesse: the true visage, & a glasse: ye image of God, & ye shape of abōdman: for in al these thynges my feyth is ryche but my vnderstāding is veray pore. And (I praie you) is vnderstāding and beleuing of egual sauourynesse, seyng yt beleuing is vnto merite, & vnderstāding vnto rewarde? Thou seest as ferre oddes to bee betwene the ꝓuenders, as there is betwene ye places. And as the heauēs are exalted in heigth frō the yearth: so are y• inhabitours in them. Here thou seest that Bernard dooeth in plain & open wordes make a cōtrariousnesse betwene ye remēbraūce of a thing, & the psence of the same: and so betwene certain other thynges whyche dooe greatly auaille to thys matter. But let vs returne to our aduersaries. They haue of the fathers & aunciēt wrytters of the Churche whō to laye agaynst vs yt is to wete, Ireneus who affirmeth the sacramente o

But if thou wouldest afterward putte as great & as nere a coniūctiō betwene ye bread & Christes bodi, as there is betwene the diuine nature and the humaine nature in Christe: this poincte wer in no wyse to bee graūted. For thā there should of necessite one substaūce or subiecte bee made of ye bread & of Christes bodie, so yt they should neuer be plucked asonder or disseuered ye one from ye other: whiche thinges wer vttrely against al reasō. Out of ye rest of the fathers they obiecte for the most parte ye self same thinges that ye trāsubstāciatours cited before. But now leat vs see what those ꝑsones whyche embrace ye thyrd opiniō, dooe saye against these men. Fyrst & formeste thei dooe not admitte ye said scatering abroade of Christes bodie in suche sorte, yt it maye bee euerye where:Obiections against this opinion of the co

For he had sufficiētely wrytē al ye geare afore. And the summe of the doctrine whiche the others had leaft vnspoken, Ihon did supply in the said sixth chapitur. Neither is there any cause (saye they) why any person should allege y• cōmuniō to bee therefore superfluous.The vtilitees of receiuing the cō

            Besides thys there is there conteined a certain token or pledge wherbye the Christianes dooe note theym selfes ioygned and knitte together emong themselfes and with Chryste, & besydes this, they professe their feyth concernyng the bodye of Chryste nailled on the crosse, and concernynge his bloud that was shed forth for our redempcion For it is not enough to beleue with the herte, but confession is made wyth the mouth too, and not onelye wyth the mouthe, but also wyth outewarde dooinges. Neither dooe these men admitte that the others saie, whiche is, that the wycked also dooe receiue the bodye of Christe.The wicked dooe not receiue christes bodye. For our senses and reason dooe not reache vnto hym, therefore it remaineth that he is receiued by feith. Of the whyche feith, forasmuche as the said parties are destitute, they can haue nothing but the outeward signes. And Paule wryteth thus. Whoso eateth this breade vnwoorthyly. &c. and sayeth not, whoso eateth the bodie of Christe vnwoorthily.
            Ferthermore thei meruaille at these men whiche folowes the cōtrarie opinion, that they should attribut remission of synnes vnto the saied corporal or bodyly eatyng of Christe. For that is too admitte a worke yt is accepted for ye veray weorkyng or doyng of it, wheras remissiō of synnes is not had but through feyth. Thei dooe afterward lene and staygh altogether vpon the speakynges of Paule, whan the lorde biddeth this to

bee dooen in remembraunce in hym, and his death to bee shewed til he come, whyche wordes seme vnto them to declare the absence of Christes bodye, and not hys presence. But we haue elswhere geuen aduertisemēte yt thys argumente is nothyng so strong nor substancial an argumente, excepte it bee vnderstāded of the bodie of Christe really, corporally, and naturally present.
            For els forasmuche as it is receiued by feith, it is not vnderstanded to bee vtterly absent, though hys abydynge bee in heauen as touchyng his nature and his substaūce. For he is eaten spiritually, & is thereby in veray true dede ioygned and knitte vnto vs.
            They allege after this the fathers who dooe in plain and manifest woordes geue a determinate sentence, and saye precisely, that here is a type or countrepaine, a signe, & a figure of Christes bodye. And they bryng in for theyr purpose twoo similitudes or comparisons, One is of a frende, vnto whom his frende that is absent is yet neuerthelesse sayed to bee present whā his mynde or thought renneth on hym. Also they putte many lookyng glasses whiche are in a circuit round about one and thesame man, whose looke and face is multiplied throughe out all these glasses euery one of them, though the man moue not out of his place. In dede I cōfesse that these are similitudes though some what to cold to agree well wyth thys misterie. For a frende cōprehēded and cōceiued in a mannes thought and beeyng stille rennyng in his mynde, dooeth not weorke any alteracion or chaunge in the partie that is the thynker on his frende, nor fedeth or nourisheth hys mynde, nor also dooeth so renewe hys bodye, that he maye bee made apte or hable to receiue the resurrecctiō.

And ye same yt is cōteined ī a glasse, is but a veray slēdre & light shadowe, neither ought so slēdre a thing to be compared wt our ioygning & coupling to Christ. For the spiritual presence of Christe whiche we putte, hath the power of the holy ghoste annexed vnto it, whyche dooeth moste streightly couple vs vnto hym. Yet the sayd similitudes are not vtterly to bee reiected for somuche as they maye by some manier of meanes induce & lede vs to the trueth so yt thei be vnderstāded, not to bee altogether ful egual wt the thyng self. For ye said similitudes dooe notifie vnto vs how thys receyuyng of Christe is doen by feyth, & wt the mynde. And mētion they make of two manier of couplynges of vs wyth Christe. The one is, that by feith we enbrace his bodie nailled on the crosse, & hys bloud shed foorth for our redēpciō. The other is, yt ye veray sonne of god toke our veray true nature vpō him, & by this meanes there is entred & begonne a natural cōmuniō betwene vs & Christe, wherof there is a mēciō made in ye secōd chap. of the epistle to the Hebrewes. But there is a certain thyrd knittyng together whiche we entre and beginne wyth Christe by eatyng hym spiritually, of whiche they dooe not make so often mencion though thei dooe not altogether hold theyr peace of it. But of thys thyrd knittyng of vs wyth Christ we shal traicte here a litel after. That if these men bee demaunded the question, whether Christe bee present in the lordes supper or not: thei saie he is, but thei saye this by ye figure synecdoche, because ye one parte of Christe, that is to saye his godhed, is veraily & truely psent there. Otherwyse in expounyng our lordes saiyng, this is my bodye thei vse ye figure of metonimia, (of whiche we haue afore spokē) vsing ye name of ye thing self ī stede of ye signe. And thei seme to graūt veray Christe hymself in suche wyse to

be there psēt, as ye sūne, whiche kep

               th himself stil ī his owne circle, is neuerthelesse saied to be present to the worlde, & ye same to gouerne wt hys goyng about & wt his lighte. And how veraily feith maye make y• thyng psēt, they thynke theymself
                  •
               s to haue sufficiētely declared out of ye epistle to ye Galathiās where Paule saied y• Christ was described & sette out before theyr yies, & crucified euē emōg theim. Now remaineth yt b
                  •
               twene these two opiniōs & determinatiōs we shewe what is by our iudgemēt either to be auoided, or to be receiued: not y• I mynde to checke singular and moste excellent men that haue been or to geue any geacke eyther to Luther or els to zwynglius. For as thouchyng zwynglius I doe certainly knowe, y• in hys boke he putteth ye signes in this sacramēt in no wyse to be void or vain signes, as I haue aboue sayed. And also it hath beē tolde me of mē yt haue beē cōuersaūt wt Luther, y• he of a trueth made none other cōiūctiō betwene ye bodye of Christe & ye outward signes, but a coniunctiō sacramētal. But how the contencion betwene theym was increased and enkiēdled, y• time serueth not now to reherse it. Setting therefore these men asyde, whiche neuer can bee praised ynough, we wil 
                  •
               reacte of y• opiniōs euē as they are recited at large, & tossed to & fro in ye world. Wherfore in ye former opinion, I dooe in no case approue ne allow ye grosse copulatiō of ye bodye of Christe wt the breade, so yt it should be naturally, corporally, & really cōteyned in ye same breade. For ye holy scripture doeth not cōstreigne vs to stablishe any suche doctrine: & to multiplie & heape vp so many miracles without testimonie of goddes woorde, standeth not wel wt the rule of diuinitee. Besides thys, suche a presence is not necessarye, neither hath it any efficacye as touching our saluacion. Also

that the vngodly should receiue the bodye of the lorde I doe not admitte. For whatsoeuer the lorde hath instituted he hath done it that it myght bee to our saluacion: but the carnall and corporal eating is not for the saluacion of the vngodly: ergo Christe hath not instituted the sayd eating of hys bodye in suche sorte. And whatsoeuer the vngodly dooe there eate corporally, it maye not bee said that thei eate the bodye of Christe, except ye wyll geue vnto the outward signe or matier of the sacramente, the name of the thyng. Morouer we wyl not graūte ye bodie of Christe to bee euerye where, or to bee dispersed thorough out al or many places, because this is contrarie and repugnaunt to the condicions of mannes nature.
            Neither also is it to bee thought that there is any difference betwene the spirituall eatyng whyche is wryten in the syxth chapiter of Ihon, and that whyche the lorde did institute at his last supper: sauing that to the sam
                  •
                doctrine and promise whiche he had taught before, he did now at hys last supper adde ye said outward signes, & putte ye thing ī executiō, whiche he hath taught before. Also yt th
                  •
               y speake doubtfully cōcerning the adoracion or wurshippyng of the sacramente, ought not to bee admitted. For we haue taught afore bothe plainly and clerely, what is to bee thought cōcernyng that mattier. And thus muche of this opinion frō the whiche I iudge to bee excepted and auoided all these pointes whiche I haue now rehearsed.
            In the seconde opinion this I lyke not, that they dooe so seldome make mencion of the sacramental mutation of the breade & the wyne, whiche yet is no small matier. And the fathers whāsoeuer they seme to fauour

the trāsubstanciatiō. Yet haue a respecte vnto ye said sacramētal mutation. Also ye holye scriptures dooe not cō
               temne it for Paule in the same place where he treateth of the sacramente,
                  What thing is not approued in this opiniō as touching the corporal presence of Christe in the sacramente.

                dooeth not onely cal it the cuppe, but the cuppe of the lorde. We see also, that in the olde testamente thinges that wer offered, wer not onely called holy, but also moste holy, wherefore they ought not to esteme this mutaciō to bee a small matier, seeyng that it is of so greate weyght & efficacie. But if they will excuse the matier, saiyng, that they dooe it because we should not cleue to muche vnto the outward or material signes, it is to bee aunswered, that thys sore maie bee easely remedied by a doctrine whereby men maye bee instructed, that Christe is ioygned wyth vs by a moste excelent coniunction or knotte whan we dooe communicate, in that that he abideth in vs, and we in him: Secoundly in that that he is ioygned wyth vs by the wordes,Christe is ioygned vnto vs by three thynges. and that by the waye of signifiyng or betokenyng. Thyrdly he is ioygned vnto vs by the material signes, and that also by the waye of signifiyng: whyche not wythstanding is lesse then that whyche belongeth to the woordes. Yea and the material signes take theyr signifiyng or betokenyng of the former cō
               ioynyng and couplyng whiche cōmeth of the wordes. If these thynges bee diligently, duely, and ordrely taught: there shall bee no daungier in the matier. I graunte that the writers of this opinion haue somtime treated and made mencion of thys sacramental chaūge but yet veray seldome. Morouer they haue not allwaies aydded therūto that efficacye whiche is due vnto it.Of the efficacie of the sacrament. For these thynges are not made vulgare or comon signes, but suche signes as maye myghtily & strongly

stiere vp yt mynde. They wyl saie: thē shal ye attribute to muche vnto the elementes & material thynges of this world. Wherūto we aunswer, yt these thynges are not attributed vnto theym for thē selfes, but for ye lordes institutiō & ordinaunce, for the power of the holy ghoste, & for the clerenes & plainnesse of the wordes. If they demaūde where I finde, yt ye holy ghoste weorketh in thys matier:The holy ghoste weorketh at the receiuing of the communion. ye aunswer there to is easie. For we haue alreadie putte & cōcluded yt thys eatyng is spirituall. And how cā we eate spiritualli wythout ye holy ghoste? As touching ye instituciō of ye lorde there is no doubte to bee made: & of ye efficacie of the worde the scriptures speake in dyuers places. Paule sayeth, that the gospel is ye power of god vnto saluaciō, that is to wete, because god doeth by ye instrumēte of ye ghospel declare hys power. And what other thyng is ye sacramēte of Eucharistia, but the ghospel, or the woord visible? Paule sayeth also, that fayth cōmeth by hearyng, & ye hearyng by the worde of God, not yt ye worde maketh vs beleue, (for it is the holy ghoste through whō we dooe beleue:) but he vseth ye instrumēte of the wordes, & also of the sacramē
               tes, whiche are the wordes of God suche as maye bee cōprehended wt our outwarde & bodyly senses. Who knoweth not also yt by the worde of God the creatures are sanctified, as it is in ye epistle to Timothe, whyche also must bee ryghthely takē. For the holy ghoste is he that sāctifieth in dede, neuerthelesse he dooeth it by the instrumēte bothe of the wordes & of the sacramentes. Therefore thys mutatiō or chaūge, maye not bee takē awaye frō the breade & the wyne, by ye whyche they are made signes of the bodye & bloud of Christe effectual & myghty in operatiō, that is to saye, suche as by theym

the spirite of the lorde woorketh in vs myghtely, & not after ye cōmon sorte, if 
                  •
               o bee, yt we on our parte bee endewed, wyth feyth and godlynesse. For we dooe not here establyshe an efficacie whyche tyeth our saluaciō to ye thynges of thys worlde. Neither leat any man here obiecte & saye: Seing thys receiuing of ye cōmuniō is dooen by feyth, what shal they bee the better yt do cōmunicate, seeying that in case they bee feythful, they haue Christ alreadie ioygned vnto theym? For suche persones maie easily bee aūswered. Christe is in dede alreadie ioygned vnto vs, but he is daily by receiuing the cōmuniō more nerer & nerer ioygned vnto vs: & whan we dooe cōmunicate, he is more & more vnited & made one wt vs. Besides thys, in receiuing of it we doe fulfil the cōmādemēt of ye lorde, who cōmaūded yt we should eate & drinke thys sacramēt. Ye myght els saye euē the lyke of baptisme too. For whāsoeuer any man dooeth beleue, he is iustified wtout delaye, & hath forgeuenesse of his sinnes: & yet notwtstādyng he is not Baptised in vayne. If ye demaunde again, whether thys efficacye of ye sacramēte of Eucharistia.
               Whether the efficacie of Eucharistia doe extēde equally & indifferently to all men. doeth extende equally & indifferētely vnto al men: I aunswer, no. But it is accordyng to ye rate & porciō of feithe in the parties that dooe cōmunicate, as Origen sayed vpon the fifteenth chapitur of Mathewe. It is not ye substaunce of thys sacramēte that dooeth profite, (sayeth he) but it is that whiche is by ye worde & by prayer that heireth our myndes accordyng to the quātitee and porcion of our feith. There is yet another thyng that I would haue theim to beate in to ye mindes of ye people: which is, yt through the cōmuniō we are incorporated, & (as ye would saye) enbodied vnto Christe whiche worde of enbodyeng, is no straunge nor no newe deuised worde in scripture.

For in Paule to the Ephesians it is sayd
                  •
                that the Gentiles are made felowe heyres and concorporall wyth Christe: and the greke woorde therof is 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                For although we putte that the vnderstanding and takyng of Christes bodye is dooen by feyth: yet notwythstanding at thys conceiuing and takyng, there foloweth effectually a true coniunction (I saye) betwene vs and Christe, (and not a feigned or ymaginatiue coniunction) whiche first perteyneth to the solle and then redoundeth vnto the bodye.We are incorporated vnto Christe whā we dooe cōmunicate.
            
            And the same cōiunctiō and incorporacion of vs wyth Christe, is commended vnto vs in the holy scriptures of Paule, vnder a comparison of the head and the bodye, whan he calleth vs mēbres of one bodye vnder Christe whiche is the head: and vndre a comparison of the state and condicion of wedlocke, wherin twoo are made one fleashe. Whyche thyng to expresse, Cyrillus brought forth a like exaumple of molten wax whyche beeyng myxte wyth other waxe becōmeth of two substaūces one substaunce. Euen so is it Cyrillus mynde that Christe is ioygned vnto vs. And to this purpose dooe the woordes of Paule to the Ephesians make verai greatly. Where it is saied, that we are of his fleshe, and of his bones.Whether Christ be of our fleshe or we of hys fleashe. Which woordes at the first sight whan a man looketh on theim, seme to haue another menyng, and seme that thei ought to haue ben spoken another waie, that is to wete, that the sonne of God is of our flesh and of our bones because he toke fleashe of our kynde. But Paule vnderstode not bare and cōmon fleashe, but suche fleashe as wer clene from synne, fleashe apte to receiue the resurrectiō
               
and immortalitee. Whyche kynde of fleashe the feithfull, forasmuche as they haue it not of theymselfes, nor yet by the procreation of Adam they doe chalenge & take it of Christ whā thei are incorporated into him by the sacramentes, and by feith. Thus than there happeneth a certain slidynge and issuynge of Chryste into vs,The issuing of Christe in to vs. and a certain spirytuall touchynge whyche Paule considered & wel weighed, whan he sayd to the Galathians: I lyue, yet not I, but Chyste lyueth in me.
            Neyther it is necessarye that for these thynges Chryste shoulde bee dyspersed and scattered aboute throughoute infinyte places. For all that euer we dooe here teache is spirituall. And yet is it not a feygned thynge nor phantasticall. For phantasies, idolles, or thynges imagined and feigned, dooe not fede the solle as it is certayn that it is dooen herein this sacramente. For we haue saied, and dooe confyrme, that these materiall sygnes dooe moste truely sygnyfye, represente, and exhibite vnto vs the bodye of Chryste, to bee eaten: howebeit it is spiritually, that is, wyth the mouth of the solle to bee eaten, and not of the bodye.
            If ye demaunde howe the fathers of the olde lawe coulde haue the selfe same thynge in theyr sacramentes that we haue: the aunswer is easy to bee made.
            For we haue concluded that in thys sacramente the matier is not dooen corporallye, but spiritually. And it is read in the Apocalypse, that ye lambe was offred frō the beginnīg of the world. The fathers of ye old law awaited for thinges to come, & we remembre

the thinges that now alreadie past. Finally this on
                  •
               ly thing we shewe and declare necessarie to bee taken hede vnto: whyche is, that the same whyche we dooe alwayes adde of the spirituall manier of receyuyng taken to bee preiudicyall or de

               ogati
                  •

For Austen saied vpon the fiftie fowerth psalme, that the lordes bodye is in a certain and determinate place, that is to wete, in heauen: but the trueth of the lordes bodye is euerye where. For wheresoeuer the faithfull bee, they conceyue and beleue that Chryste had a true bodye in dede whyche was geuen for vs, and by feith thei eate thesame. Thus haue I said my minde what ought to be dooen accordyng to the scriptures in this matier of the sacramente.

               te. God of his goodnesse graunt that the Churche of Chryst maie once obteine to come to the truth, and also to a concord & peace concernynge thys sacrament. Whyche twoo thinges I dooe for thys cause wishe and desire, for that I considre the sacramente of Eucharistia, wherof we treacte, to haue ben hitherto ouerwhelmed, buried, & deformed with lyes, deceyptes, and supersticions, that it might bee rather estemed any other thynge then that whiche the lorde in his supper did institute.
            Whiche churche to the entent we should not haue easely or soone pourged, the deuil beyng a most greuous enemie to all peace and trueth, hath sowen so many opinions, contencions, debates, Heresies, and battailes in manier euen to bloudshed & manslaughter: that an vniforme and reasonable consent and agrement therin suche as is mete for Christen people to haue, semeth

in a manier vnpossible to be hoped for. Howebeit (alas) we suffre these thynges not without desert, for ye that we haue dishonoured this sacramente two manier of wayes: partely in that that of this so excellent and so singuler a gifte of Christe, we haue erected and sette vp an execrable Idoll: and partly for that we haue vsurped these holye mysteries with an vnclene feith, with a conscience polluted with moste greuous synnes, without any due profe or examinacion of our selues. Wherfore I beseche almighty god, that he wil take pitie vpon this great calamitie, & that he vouchesafe once to restore vnto his Churche the Sacramente of Eucharistia truelye receiued and restored: and I beseche hym that he wyl graunt vs the right vse thereof through Iesus Christ oure Lorde. Amen.
