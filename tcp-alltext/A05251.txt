               Every proud perſone wold compare hym ſelf to god
in ſo moche as they gloryfye them ſelf in the goodes
that they haue. Of whyche thynges the glorye is due pryncypally
to god. ¶And it is a grete abuſion whan the creature
taketh pride in hym ſelf for the goodes that god hath ſent
hym / for whyche goodes he ought to be the more humble toward
god / and the better to knowe and to ſerue hym deuoutly
Therfor ſayth the prophete that god reſyſteth ayēſt the proude
folke whyche ben fallen vylaynſly. Emonge whome the fyrſt
was lucyfer / whiche for his pryde fyl fro heuen to helle & alle
they that conſented to his ſynne. Semblably our fyrſt fader

                  boden / therfore he was put oute of paradys

the chamberyer of ſara was ryght proud ayenſt hyr mayſtreſſe
by cauſe of a chylde that ſhe had by Abraham. But fynably
ſhe was put oute for hyr pryde and hyr chylde alſo / and
nothyng was gyuen to hyr at departyng but a lytel brede &
water. as it apperyth in the xvj chapytre of geneſis. ¶Alſo
we rede how the pryde of nembroth and of many other was
a grete parte cauſe of many euyllis and of the deuyſyon of the
world as it apperyth in the book aforſayd / For after Noes
flood were the geants whyche by theyr pryde entrepryſed the
aſſault ayenſt heuen. & edyffyed the toure of babylon. And therfore
they were deuyded in to many lāgages in ſuche wyſe that
none vnderſtode other as it apperith in the xi chapytre of geneſis.
And as me ſemeth pryde ſourdeth but onely of folye / For
who ſo wel knoweth hym ſelf. yf he be euyl. he hath cauſe of
grete humylyte / For alle ſynne is ſhame and ſeruytude / And
yf he be good. he hath cauſe alſo of grete humylite for the

grace that god hath doon to hym. in ſo moche that he is good
& agreable to god. & to haue humylite admoneſteth vs the pnnycion
that we rede of them that were proude / for we rede how
pharao was ſoo proude that he ſayd. he wyſt not who was
god of Iſrael. & that he ſette nouȝt ne helde not of hym. as it appereth
in the v chapytre of exode but fynably he was punyſſhed
& drowned in the reed ſee & all his. Furthermore we rede
how Amon for his pryde wold be honoured of alle men. And
was moche angry ayēſt Mardocheꝰ a man ſo named by cauſe
that he wold not worſhyp hym. But fynably the ſaid amon
was honged on a galowes whyche he had ordeyned & made

more abymelech for his pride dyd to ſlee hym ſelf. for by cauſe
that a woman had ſmyten hym. he callyd one his ſquyer. &
bad hym to ſlee hym to thende that it be not ſayd. that a woman
hath ſlayn hym. as it apperyth in the ix chapytre of Iudyth.
Rede we not alſo how Balthaſar was ſlayne for hys
pryde▪ And Nabugodonoſor was caſt doun fro his ſyege. and
torned in to a dombe beeſt as it apperith in the v chapytre of danyel.
Anthiochus alſo for his pryde was gretely punyſſhed
of god. & ſmyton with a dyſeaſe of whiche he myght neuer be
heled. as it apperith in the ſecond book of Machabees. And generally
al proude men atte laſt haue be ouerthrowen. Rede we
not how the pryde of Nychanor was deſcomfyt and brought
to nought as it apperyth in the fyrſt book of Machabees the
viij chapytre / ¶And Abſalon whyche wold haue taken the
Royame fro his fader / was he not vyſaynouſly ſlayne as it
apperith in the ſecond book of kynges the xv chapytre. who
made Pheton to falle but hys pryde. For he wold gouerne the

And me ſemeth that for to flee fro pryde we haue ſuffyſaunt
enſamples in that whiche is tofore ſayd / But yet aboue this
it is good to be conſydered how pryde is not al onely noyeng

pryde ouerthroweth the creature. right ſo humylite enhaūceth

the virgyne Marie pleſed god by cauſe of her humylite. & dauid
whiche was leeſt emonge hys brethern. was enhaunſed
aboue them alle as it apperith in the fyrſt book of kynges. the

his brother had the benyſon tofore hym as it appieryth
the xxxviij chapytre of geneſis & generally humylite & mekenes

witneſſeth the prophete ſayeng. that whan a man is in pryde
he leſeth his vnderſtondyng & knowleche. And is lyke a beeſt
whiche hath none vnderſtondyng / by whyche it appereth that
a man whiche wyl bycome wyſe ought to be humble. and to
knowe hym ſelf wythout wenyng that he be that. whyche he
is not. And to thys purpoos recounteth ſaynt gregory in his
dyalogue the fyrſt book the xv chapitre. How Conſtancius
was ſo humble that he loued more them that deſpyſed hym
than them that honoured hym. And ther came a man that deſyred
moche for to ſee hym for the grete renōmee of hym and
alſo for the good that was ſpoken of hym. And fynably whā
lx ſawe hym he began to ſaye by maner of wondryng ¶O
Conſtanciꝰ I had ſuppoſed that thou haddeſt ben a grete man
ſtronge & parfyght. & of ſynguler facōn / but now I ſee clerely

¶I anſner to the / that it is to obſerue mekenes and

ofte ſhal I ſo anſuer the / For humilite ſuffreth no poynte of
errour ne thentendement therof. but engendreth ſcience and

knowlege of trouthe / And to this purpoos ſayth Ancelme in
the xxviij chapytre of his ſymylitudes that humylyte hath
vij degrees. The fyrſt is to knowe wel hym ſelf. The ſecond
is ſorow for his ſynne. The thyrd is to confeſſe hys ſynne / The
fourth is to knowleche that he is a ſynner and enclyned
to doo euyl The fyfthe is for to deſpyſe all hym ſelf The ſixthe
is gladly for tendure vylanye. The ſeuēth is to reioyce of his
humylite / And thus it appereth that humylyte engēdreth very
knowlege. And therfor ſaynt Bernard in his book of the
degrees of humylyte ſayth / that humylite is none other thyng
but a vertue whyche maketh a man veryly to knowe hym
ſelf and to deſpyſe hym. And for to haue the ſame admoneſteth

playre that we ought to take in hym & in hys dedes as ſayth
ſaynt Ierome in his epiſtle lxxxvij. More ouer we rede in

hughe counceylleth in his book of the cloyſtre of the ſowle / and
the prophete yſaye in his xlvi chapytre in ſayeng to the ſynnar

Thus dyd a moche wyſe prophete named Sixius. the

thus we ought to do to she nde. that in knowyng our ſelf we
haue cauſe to meke & to humble our ſelf toward god. & thēne

Neuertheles whan he herd the payne that he ought to haue

penaunce they gate grace as Ionas reherceth in his iij chapytrr.
By the whyche thynges it apperith how humylite geteth

of kynges the fyrſt chapytre. By whyche it apperith euydently
that pryde is diſplayſaūt to god and the proude men were
ſomtyme ryght gretely pugnyſſhed. But by humylite the creature
may wel gete grace and pardon of god ¶Alſo we rede
how the woman of Chananee by humble ſpekyng gate helth
for hir doughter as reherceth ſaynt Mathewe in his xv chapytre
/ And to this humylite we haue example by ſaynt Iohn
baptyſte whiche lyued in deſerte in ryght grete penaunce and
very humylite / and ſayd hym ſelf to be vnworthy to touche the
latchet of the ſhoo of Iheſu Cryſt. And he was clad wyth a
camels ſcyn as ſaynt mathew reherceth in his thyrd chapytre
& by cauſe of this humylite he was enhaunced aboue al other
& called more than a prophete. Semblably helye was of ryȝt
humble lyf. and therfor god enhaunced hym ryght gretely / &
was the fyrſt prophete for whome god began to ſhewe myracles
as it appereth in the fourth book of kynges. the fyrſt the
ix / xiiij. & the xvij chapytres / Moreouer the chyldren of Iſrael
were repriſed by holofernes. But fynably they humbled them
ſelf / and were ſaued as it apperith the x chapytre of Iudith.
And generally by humylite the creature may gete of god that

               How humylite is agreable to god & to the world capo. iiij
               HVmylite is moche playſant to god & to the world / For
ſhe wytneſſeth of thomage that the creature oweth to do
to his creatour naturelly. euery good man hateth pryde / wherfore
it foloweth that he loueth humylite / And veryly we ſee
in dede that a proude man may haue no frende & the reaſon is
this. For he may not ſuffre that another be lyke to hym / but
he wyl ſurmounte euery man / & ſo gaynſayeth alle amytye.
For as Aryſtotle ſayth iu the ix chapytre of the Ethyques.
Amytie or frendſhyp requireth ſemblaūce & ſomme equalite
bytwene them that ſo owen to loue. alas pryde deuyded heuen
pryde alſo maketh many warres in the world. For wylle &
deſyre to regne maketh ofte many grete bataylles. & ſomtyme
wythout cauſe put many men to deth. Therfor the wyſe man
ought to humble his hert for to be loued of god. & after of the
world / And of ſo moche as the creature hath more of good &
welth / & laſſe of aduerſite. of ſo moche he ought the more to
humble hym ſelf and not tabyde the tyme of neceſſyte whā he
ſhal by force be humbled / Therfore ſayth Ariſtotle that more
it auaylleth hym that humbleth hym ſelf by his owen wylle
than to hym that is humbled by force. And therfore Seneke
in his epiſtle to lucille lxx. ſayth thus. brynge thy ſelf to lowe
& lytel aſtate withoute to enhaunce thy ſelf / to thende that fortune
make not the to falle foo hye to lowe. Say not the naturyens
that the lyon doth no harme to a man that humbleth
hym ſelf to hym. & wylde bore doth noo harme to a man
that is leyde on therthe / And therfore a man oweth by ryght
to humble hym ſelf for teſche we peryll. And to this purpoos
we rede how dydymꝰ in his epyſtle ſayd to alyxandre. knowe
thou for trouthe that god is redy to do to the moche good. ſo
that thou be not deceyued by thy pryde. by whyche it apperyth
that pryde empecheth wytte & aduys. & maketh a man to lyue
without peas of conſcience. For hates & noyſes be founded in

pryde. as in the rote of al enemyte / And to this purpoos ſayen

for he may endure nothyng of the world. neceſſe not to deſpyſe

vyces / that humylite adreſſth a man. & maketh his lyf more
in a moyen in al his operations and teſche we oultrage. Therfore
reherceth valere in his fourth book that ſyth that another
Valere had be moche grete at Rome. he put hym ſelf frely in
a ryght lytel aſtate / and lefte al pompes and al worldly thynges.
and me ſemeth that al proud peple ought to aduyſe them
vpon the hyſtoryes and auncient examples the wyche ſhewe
how humylite enhaunceth the peple / and pryde ouerthroweth

By whyche it appereth that the humbles haue ben enhaunſed

nettes of gold / where is the puyſſaūce of pharao. where is the
myghty cyte of Troye whyche was ſo renomed / where is babylone
that was ſo made iu heyght. Certeynly all is come to
nouȝt / For pryde may not longe endure. What auaylleth thēne
pryde whyche the world ſo moche loueth / what is bycome of
Arphaxat the proud kyng. he was all vanyſſhed awaye as
ſmoke. what is bycome of Agryppe and Iulyen that were ſo

Architofel the wyſe counceyllour of dauyd fynably he henge

hym ſelf in his wytte & connyng / more ouer what auaylleth
the yf thou be fayr / For Abſalon was fayr / neuertheles he
was hanged on a tree. And tholyfaūt for al the beaulte of his
yuorye & his teeth is ofte put to deth. The gamaleō is moche
fayr in his lyf. but he is ryght foul in his deth. what auaylleth
thēne the beaulte of this world. Thus euery perſone may
ſee and wel apperceyne. that ther is no thynge in thys world
wherof we ought to haue pryde for to gloryfye our ſelf. And
this conſydered the kyng of perce ſeeyng his people and hys

But it is pyte / ſeen that in ſhort tyme they ſhal be but erthe / In
lyke wyſe recounteth ſaynt Iherome. that ther is no thyng
of the world that endureth For we rede that Ionynyan dyd
grete payne for to bycome a kyng. but he deyed the ſame day
that he ſhold haue be made kyng of the royame of Perce. and
Valentyne that was ſo ryche. was by bledyng at the mouthe
dede & quenchyd. And his ſone gracyen was betrayed of hys
owen people & ſlayu by one his enemye / Thenne it is but lytyl
glorye to ſeygnourye and to haue ryclxſſes. and the ſame
ſayd the kyng agryppe / whyche is tofore named. the which in
deyeng cryed wyth an hyghe wys. Alas my good peple ſette
nothyng by hauyng of ryclxſſes. For me that am your lord
ye may ſee deye right pourely. And therfore Orace in his epyſtles
ſayth. that there is nothyng that better apperteyneth to a
man than lowlynes or lytel thyng. For to a lytel thynge

apperteyneth lytel. That is to wete humylite / the which maketh
agreable to god and to the world as tofore is ſayd.
            
            
               How the creature ought humbly to obeye to god capitulo v
               THe ſcrypture ſayth that obeyſſannce pleſeth more vnto
god / than doth ſacrefyſe. And herof we haue example
of our fyrſt fader Adam whych vſed hys owen propre wylle
and lefte the commaundement of our lord Iheſu cryſt. which
god had gyuen hym / And therfore he fyl in to grete pouerte
and in to many myſeryes. as wytneſſeth Saynt Auguſtyn
in hys xv omelye vpon the goſpel of Saynt Iohn / It is alſo
wel reaſon that the ſeruaunte obeye to hys mayſter / And conſequently
the creature to god / And to this purpoos recounteth
valerye in his ſecond book how of old
                     •
                   tyme the knyghtes obeyed
to the prynces vpon payne of deth / By moche more ſtronge
reaſon we ought to obeye to god wyth al our myght. For as
ſayth the ſcripture we ought more to obeye to god than to men
And yf we obeye vs to men / that ought to be for the loue of
god. Thus counceylleth vs thappoſtle. And certeynly moche
good is fallen to them. that haue humbly obeyed god. And to
this purpoos recounteth Saynt gregory in his dyalogue the
fyrſt book the ſeuenth chapytre how ſaynt benet had a dyſciple
whom he cōmanded that he ſhold rēne vpon the water. whome
he obeyed & was ſaued fro peryll. Thenne ſaynt

                  e flouryſſhed. and this hyſtorye reherceth Caſſiam the

fyrſt look of his collacōns in whiche he recounteth alſo how
the dyſciple of a ryght olde man at his cōmandement wold
remeue a ryght grete toche / and aduyſed hym not yf he myȝt doo it or not. For it ſuffyſed hym to obeye his mayſter after
his power / By the whyche thynges it appereth how obedyēce
is agreable to god. for the whyche to haue. we haue example
in nature / as ſayen the naturyēs. The beſtes obeyen to the lyon
as to theyr kynge / And dar not paſſe the cercle that the lyon
maketh with his taylle. Sēblably the bees that maken hony
obeye to theyr kynge / and the Cranes alſo. And in nature we
ſee many thynges ſemblable. More ouer in holy scripture we
haue to this purpoos many examples. And veryly we rede
how Noe obeyed ryght expreſly to god as it apperith in the
vij. chapytre of geneſis. And therfor he was ſaued / fro the
flood. ¶Semblably the chyldren of Israel for theyr obedyence
were kepte of god as it apperyth in the ix chapytre of the
boke of nombres. Thappoſtles alſo lyghtly obeyeden to god in
ſo moche that they folowed hym atte fyrſt callyng as recyteth
ſaynt Mathew in his iiij chapytre / And therfor aboue al peple
ben they enhaunced in the chyrche / and alſo in heuen. Semblably
Abraham obeyed to god in ſo moche that he wold haue
ſacrefyed his owen ſone and smyten of his heed atte cōmandement
of god as it apperyth in the xxij chapytre of geneſis.
And therfore god promyſed to abraham that of his ſeed ſhold
be born the ſauyour of the world. Therfore we ought more to
obeye to god than to man. as it is tofore ſayd. And accordyng
to this we haue enſaumple of Mathathias whyche anſuerd
to the meſſager of the kyng Anthiocus ſayeng. that yf alle obeyed
to the kyng Anthiocus. yet he wold not obeye to hym
but to god. as it is wryton in the book of machabees the ſecōd
chapytre. ¶we rede alſo of the ſeuen brethern / that had leuer
to deye than to ete fleſſhe forboden. ayenſt the cōmandement of
god. not wythſtōdyng the kyng cōmanded it to them. wherby
it apperith that they ought to be repreued that excuſe them of

the euyl that they doo for theyr maiſtres that ſo commaunde
them. For ſuche is of noo value. by cauſe they ought fyrſt obeye
the cōmaundement of god. as ſayth Saynt Petre in the
v chapytre of thaetes of thappoſtles. More ouer for to obeye / ought
to enclyne vs the example of the virgyne Marie. the
whyche obeyed to the wordes of the aungel in ſayeng. Loo the
handmayde of god. late it come to me as it ſhal pleſe hym. &
after thy word / we rede also how dauid not wythſtondyng
that he was kynge obeyed to hys fader / as it apperyth the fyrſt
book of kynges the vij chapytre / And yonge Thobie ſayd to
his fader that he was redy to obeye to hym / And cornchꝰ centurio
was redy tobeye to hym / whom god had ordeyued to be
prelate and mayſtre. as it apperyth the tenth chapytre of thactes
of thappoſtles / ¶Alſo we rede how the regabytes dranke
no wyn ne had no howſes / for to obeye to theyr fader / As Ieremye
reciteth in his thyrd chapytre. By whyche thynges it
apperith how obedyence was obſerued of the Auucient people
& that they that dyſobeyed were pugnyſſhed of god / as it apperyth
of the chyldren of Iſrael. the which were ouerthrowen 
                     •
                  n

entred not in to the lond of ꝓmyſſion which they deſyred as it
apperith the xxiiij chapitre of the boke of nombres / Ionas alſo
was throwen in the ſee. by cauſe he dyſobeyed to do that god
had cōmanded hym / as it ſhe weth in the thyrd chapytre of
Ionas. & therfore we ought to obeye to god fyrſ / & after to other
creatures. yf we wyl eſche we peryl & playſe Iheſu Cryſt
as ſayth ſaynt bernard vpon cantycles / The man is not worthy
to haue ony good yf he knowe not ne obeye god. & ſaynt
gregory in his omely ſayth. that he ouȝt to be mooſt humble
toward god and mooſt enclyned to ſerue hym. that hath receyued
mooſt goodes of hym / & yf he do otherwyſe the goodes
that he hath receyued ſhal be encreaſyug of his payne at the
day of Iugemēt. This wytneſſeth hughe the viij chapytre of
the boke of the Arke of Noe. And for to haue cauſe to remēbre

the god that god hath doon to vs we haue many examples
in holy ſcrypture. Rede we not how Iacob after that god had
ſente to hym many goodes.he ſayd / Syr I thanke the for the
good that thou haſt doon to me. Of whyche I moche remembre.
as it is ſhewed in the xxij chapytre of geneſis. / ¶Semblably
dyd Dauid as it apperith in the ſecond book of kynges
the vij chapytre. And Danyel ſayd. lord thy name be preyſed
and bleſſyd for the good that thou haſt doon to me / as it
apperyth in the ſecond chaptyre of danyel / ¶Semblably the
appoſtle Saynt Poul in hys epyſtles ryght ofte and contynuelly
preyſeth and thanketh god as it is ſhewed in the fyrſt
chapytre of hys epyſtle to the romayns / Rede we not alſo how
the chyldren of Iſrael ſongen in loouyng and prayſyng god
by cauſe he had delyuerd them fro ſeruytude. and that they had
paſſed wythout peryl the reed ſee. as it apperyth in the xv chapytre
of Exode. Semblably the thre chyldren that god delyuerd
fro the fournays bleſſyd god ryght ſwetely and deuoutely
as it is wryton the thyrd chapytre of danyel. by the whiche
thynges it apperyth how euery man ought to humble hym
ſelf toward god and to yelde to hym thankynges of the goodes
that he hath receyued / ¶And to thys purpoos Seneke
in his four ſcore and one epyſtle to Lucylle ſayth to a man
vnkynde. no man ought to ſay no thyng. Thenne we ought
to take enſaumple of the chyldren of Iſrael. the whyche after
theyr vyctorye of Syraza offreden vnto god many yeftes in
theyr ſacryfyſe.as it apperyth the one and twenty chapytre of
the book of nombres / And after that they had had the vyctorye
of Syraſa and Delbore they began to ſynge in preyſyng
as it apperyth in the fourth chapytre of Iudyth Semblably
whan they had had vyctorye by Iudas the Machabee ayenſt
Thimothean. they began to ſynge and prayſe god as it apperyth
in the ſecond book of Machabees the tenth chapytre. Methynketh
that they be ryght moche to be repreuyd that remembre
not the goodes that god hath doon for them / & that wers

is after the meſure that god gyueth to them mooſt good.
they become mooſt haultayn and the more prowd / they dygne
not to take enſample at the good creatures / the whyche ſom
tyme loued god the more. by cauſe of the goodes that he gat
to them / ¶Alſo we rede how Anne loued god. and thanked
god of the grace that ſhe had to haue a chylde as it apperyth
in the fyrſt book of kynges the ſecond chapytre / And whan
the vyrgyue marye had conceyued our lord Iheſu cryſt. she began
for to magnefye god in ſayeng / Magnificat anima meadominum

whyche was ryght ryche and kynge of Lyde. the whyche
offryd grete yeftes and many markes of gold and ſylner / &

And me ſemeth after the ſcryptures / the auncyent faders had

And the ſame wytneſſeth ſeneque in ſayeng. that dyogenes
was more ryche whiche had no worldly goodes / than Alyſaunder
whyche was lord of all the world for alyſaūder had
not ſo moche good that he myght gyue. As dyogenes myȝt
and wold reffuſe. Of whyche Dyogenes Ualerius recyteth
in hys fourth book. how he refuſed the yeftes whyche Dyonyſe
the Tyraunt ſente hym / And it happed that Dyogenes
on a tyme weſſhed hys herbys that he ſhold put in hys potte
and ete. And that ſeeyng Ariſtipus. whyche tofore had been
hys felowe and ſayd vnto hym in thys manere. ¶O Dyogenes
yf thou woldeſt flatre Denys / thou ſholdeſt not be in
thys pouerte. And thenne Dyogenes anſnerd to hym yf thou
woldeſt endure the pouerte that I endure. and ete & pyke thy

wortes as I doo. thou ſholdeſt not be a flaterer as thou art. Of
the ſame diogenes recoūteth ſaynt Ierome in his book ayenſt
Ionynyen how for al robes. he had but a litel mantel lyned for
teſche we colde. And in ſtede of a celyer / he had but a lytel ſachet
/ And in ſtede of an hors he had a ſtaf or a bourdon. And
was lodged in a tonne at the yate of the Cyte / the whyche
tonne after the wynde it torned for to eſche we colde. And on a
tyme he ſeyng a chylde that dranke water in his honde / and he
threwe a waye a lytel cuppe that he had / in ſayeng that hym

gyuen to hym / that is to wete his honde / By whyche it apperyth
that ſpyrituel pouerte / and very ſuffyſaunce were ſomtyme
in the wyſe men. as was dyogenes and many other.
And to this purpoos we rede how Epicurius the phyloſophre
ſayd that there is no thynge ſo moche worth as Ioyouſe pouerte.
And Orace in his epyſtles ſayth. In pouerte ouȝt not
to be dyſplayſaunce. ſyth a man haue ſuffyſaunce for his lyf
For none other thynge may al the goodes of the world gyue
to a man. And therfore ſayth Cathon to hys ſone / ſeen that
nature hath made the naked. thou oughteſt gladly and with a
good wylle endure pouerte & flee oultrage. For nature ſhall
not faylle the in thy neceſſyte / And thou ſhalt be ryche. yf thou
haſt ſuffyſaunce / as wytneſſeth geffrey in his poetrye & many
other. More ouer the wyſe man ought to conſydere and aduyſe
that no thyng is worth to a man oultrage ne ouermoche
habundaunce. Is not Anthiochus deed and comen to nouȝt
of whome recouteth valerye in his ix book how wel he bryng
kyng of Surrye he made his horſes to be arayed and adoubed
with gold / And them to be ſhoed wyth naylles of gold / And

alle he loſte ſoro wfully / For he deſyred to take awaye fro his

a right grete tyrannt and perſecutour of dauid. after he ſlewe

he muſte nedes deye. hath a drede to treſpace & doo a mys

all cooled of the vanytees and of all worldly plaſan̄ces / And
to this purpoos tullius in his firſt boke of his queſtions tuſculanes
alledgeth ſocrates. the whyche ſaith that the lyf of philoſophres
is for to thynke on the deth. Semblably ſayth platon
as recounteth Alephareus in his boke of the dyuyſyon of
philoſophye. Seneke alſo in his xvj epyſtle ſayth that a mā
bycometh franke and free by thynkyng of the deth. For that
cauſeth to aſche we ſynne. of whyche cometh all ſeruitude. and
aunciently & of olde tyme whā themperours were crowned it
was demaūded of them in what place they wolde be buryed &
thēne they aſſygned the place of theyr buryeng / & this cuſtome
was ordyned to thēde that they ſholde remembre theyr deth for
teſche we pryde / as it is recounted in the lyf of ſaynt Iohū the
Amener. Saynt gregore in his ix boke of moralles ſayth that
whan a man is tempted. the ſouerayn remedye is to thynke
on the deth / And in his xxj boke he hath the ſame purpoos geuyng
an example of them that ſaylled on the ſee. the whyche
lefte playes. and eſbatements whan they ſawe the tempeſt of

Trouthe it is that by this thynkyng no man ought to angre

the other doo not ſoo. but reioyſſe as it is aforſaid / More ouer

ſhal be no difference bytwene the poure and the ryche whan the
body ſhal be roten and aſſhen / as witneſſeth ſeneke in his epiſtle

And certaynly who that wold wel thynke how the lyf

And ſyth we haue the tyme and ſeaſon. as who wold ſaye / that
the tyme ſhall come. that we ſhal not mowe doo well / That
is to were after the deth. And to this purpoos we rede
an hyſtorye of a yong man the whiche conſyderyng that alle

And therfore I am entred in the religyon / For I wore neuer

how ſomtyme was a Royame. the whiche euery yere made
a new kynge. And as longe as the yere dured. the kynge
was mayntened in grete aſtate and in grete richeſſes. Bnt
aſſone as the yere was paſſed. he was deſpoylled all naked / &
bānyſſhed ont of the Royame. And for his ſalayre they gaaf
to hym but an egge onely. And it happed that ther was one
kynge emonge the other. whiche aduyſed hym that in the yere

ſhal be banyſſhed ont of this world / and alle naked ſent hens
Tixnne we ought in the tyme of our lyf to make puruean̄ce
of good werkes. And ſende them in to a ſtrānge contrey. that
is to ſaye / in to heuene / There ought we to make our treſour
as Ihū cryſte admoneſteth vs. that we ſhold make our treſour

employed to a ſepulture for the whiche art a ſyancer. and vnworthy
to be enhaunſed aboue therthe halowed. And to this
purpos ſpeketh ſaynt Anſtyn in his boke of them that be paſſed
out of this world. How the gloryous ſayntes of the heuene
hane not retched of theyr ſepultures. For ſom̄e haue be brent / ſom̄e
drowned / other byheded. and other delyuerd to houndes
and to beeſtis / And certaynly the ſepulture ſerued more to diſporte
of them that lyue than it dooth to the preyſyng of god. reproufyt
of thē that be deed lyke as witneſſeth ſaynt auſtyn m
his boke of the cyte of god the xi ij chapytre. And to the ſame
purpoos we rede in the ſecond boke of vicas patram. how ſom

and had a right curyo

                   ſepulture / And he ſa we a good
man throwen in to the felde and eten of beſtes. wherfor this
ſayd good man was angry / Thēne an angel aperid to this
man that was angry& ſayd to hym. My frende be nothyng
angry. For the curyous ſepulture is for payment of the euyl
man yf he haue in his lyuyng doon ony good / But the good
man whiche was eten of the houndes is hoolly rewarded in
heuene. by whiche it apperith. that the curyoſite of ſeputures

is not prouffytable. & certaynly we rede how dyogenes commāded
that after his deth. his body ſhold be delyuerd to the byrdes
aud to beſtes to ete. And whan it was demanded the reaſon
wherfore. he anſuerde that the beſtes after his deth ſhold doo
to hym none harme / thaugh they tare & deſpieced all his body
And it ſholde doo grete good to the beſtes to take of hym theyr
nature. & it is better ſo to doo than do putte it in therthe for to
rote. Alſo Tullius recoūteth in his fyrſt boke of queſtions tul
enlanes. And ſemblably he recyteth how one demanded a philoſophre
named Azagouas in what place he wold that his
body ſhold be buryed The whyche anſuerd that he was cōtent
of alle the places of the world. we rede alſo how a tryan̄t menaced
a philoſopher named theodre. that he wolde delyuer his
body to the beſtes / the whiche anſuerd that after his deth he retched
nothyng of ony ſepulcre ne of ſuche vanytes. As ſeneke
recounteth the xviij chapytre of the boke of tranquylite of courage.
And pompeius in his iij boke recyteth how the kyng lir

Ionynyen / recyteth how the people callyd meſſagiers had a
cuſtome to ete theyr parents. For it was better as they ſayde
that they ſhold ete them than the wormes / And how be it that
it is a cuyl oppynyon. Neuertheles by the thynges aboueſayd
it appierith how the aūcyent people were nothyng curyous of
theyr ſepultures. trouthe it is a thyng reſonable for to requyre
that is body be burryed in plaee halowed / For ſomtyme the
prayers that be ſayd in halowed places ben right prouffytable
And to this purpoos ſaynt Auſtyn in his boke of them that be
paſſed out of this world recyteth how a good woman dyde do
burye her ſone in the chyrche of a martyr. in hope that the preſence
of the martyr ſhal be moche prouffytable to the ſoule of
her ſone. And in dede by the prayers of the martyr his ſoule
was moche alledged of his payne and was anone ſaued. As

fyuably was ſhewede to the ſayd good woman. By whiche it
apperith that how be it that curioſyte of ſepulture be but lytyl
neceſſarye / Neuertheles halowed place is for to be demaūded
reſonable. And therfore ſom̄e aūcyents were moche dylygent
for to be buryed in place reſonable. Rede we not how Abraham
right diligētly bought a felde for to burye therin his wyf
For he wold not that ſhe were buryed in ony erthe but in his
owen as it apperith the xxij chapytre of geneſis. And Iacob
requyred his ſone Ioſeph that he myght be buryed with his
parents / as it apperith the xliiij chapytre of geneſis. And of
Moyſes we rede. how whan he paſſed out of egypte. he tranſported
the bones of Ioſeph in to the londe of promyſſſon for to
leye them with his parents as it apperith in Exode the xiiij
chapytre / & knowe thou that not onely thou oughteſt to thynke
of thy ſepulture. but alſo it is a thyng moche reſonable for
to burye the bodyes of the poure people. & herof we rede how
the an̄gel moche recom̄ended thobye by cauſe he was ſo moche
dylygent for to burye and brynge in erthe / the bodyes of the
deed people as it apperith in the fyrſt and ſecond chapytres of
his boke. And ſemblably ought moche to be preyſed Ioſeph a
Nychodemus whiche were dylygent for to burye the body of
Ihū cryſte as it apperith the xxvij chapytre of ſeynt Mathew.
by whiche thynges thou mayſt wel apperceyue / how for to burye
