               Fal.
               O good sir.
            
            
               For.
               Nay beleeue it sir Iohn, for tis time. Now my loue
               Is so grounded vpon her, that without her loue
               I shall hardly liue.
            
            
               Fal.
               Haue you importuned her by any means?
            
            
               Ford.
               No neuer Sir.
            
            
               
                  
Fal.
               Of what qualitie is your loue then?
            
            
               Ford.
               I faith sir, like a faire house set vpon
               Another mans foundation.
            
            
               Fal.
               And to what end haue you vnfolded this to me?
            
            
               For.
               O sir, when I haue told you that, I told you all:
               For she sir stands so pure in the firme state
               Of her honestie, that she is too bright to be looked
               Against: Now could I come against her
               With some detectiō, I should sooner perswade her
               From her marriage vow, and a hundred such nice
               Tearmes that sheele stand vpon.
            
            
               Fal.
               Why would it apply well to the veruensie of your affection,
               That another should possesse what you would enioy?
               Meethinks you prescribe verie proposterously
               To your selfe.
            
            
               For.
               No sir, for by that meanes should I be certaine of that which I now misdoubt.
            
            
               Fal.
               Well M. Brooke, Ile first make bold with your mony,
               Next, giue me your hand. Lastly, you shall
               And you will, enioy Fords wife.

               Fal.
               M. Brooke, I say you shall.

               Want no Misteris Ford M. Brooke,
               
               You shall want none. Euen as you came to me,
               Her spokes mate, her go between parted from me:
               I may tell you M. Brooke, I am to meet her
               Between 8. and 9. for at that time the Iealous
               Cuckally knaue her husband wil be from home,
               Come to me soone at night, you shall know how
               I speed M. Brooke.

               Fal.
               Hang him poore cuckally knaue, I know him not,
               And yet I wrong him to call him poore. For they
               Say the cuckally knaue hath legions of angels,
               For the which his wife seemes to me well fauored,
               And Ile vse her as the key of the cuckally knaues
               Coffer, and there's my randeuowes.

                  Ford, that you might shun him.
            
            
               Fal.
               Hang him cuckally knaue, Ile stare him
               Out of his wits, Ile keepe him in awe
               With this my cudgell: It shall hang like a meator
               Ore the wittolly knaues head, M. Brooke thou shalt
               See I will predominate ore the peasant,
               And thou shalt lie with his wife. M. Brooke
               
               Thou shalt know him for knaue and cuckold,
               Come to me soone at night.
               Exit Falstaffe.

               What a damned epicurian is this?
               My wife hath sent for him, the plot is laid:
               
                  Page is an Asse, a foole. A secure Asse,
               Ile sooner trust an Irishman with my

               A theefe to walk my ambling gelding, thē my wife
               With her selfe: then she plots, then she ruminates,
               And what she thinkes in her hart she may effect,
               Sheele breake her hart but she will effect it.
               God be praised, God be praised for my iealousie:
               Well Ile goe preuent him, the time drawes on,
               Better an houre too soone, then a minit too late,

               Bar:
               With Egges sir?

and throwne into the Thames like a barow of Butchers offoll. Well, and I be serued such another tricke, Ile giue them leaue to take out my braines and butter them, and giue them to a dog for a new yeares gift. Sblood, the rogues slided me in with as little remorse as if they had gone to drowne a blind bitches puppies in the litter: and they might know by my sise I haue a kind of alacritie in sinking: and the bottom had bin as deep as hell I should downe. I had bene drowned, but that the shore was sheluie and somewhat shallowe: a death that I abhorre. For you know the water swelles a man: and what a thing should I haue bene whē I had bene swelled: By the Lord a mountaine of money. Now is the Sacke brewed?
            
            
               Bar.
               I sir, there's a woman below would speake with you.

               Now whats the newes with you?

               O Lord sir, she is the sorrowfullest woman that her seruants mistooke, that euer liued. And sir, she would desire you of all loues you will meet her once againe, to morrow sir, betweene ten and eleuen, and she hopes to make amends for all.
            
            
               Fal.

               I forsooth.
            
            
               Fal.
               Well, tell her Ile meet her. Let her but think
               Of mans frailtie: Let her iudge what man is,
               And then thinke of me. And so farwell.
            
            
               Quic

               Fal.

After we had kissed and imbraced, and as it were euen amid the prologue of our incounter, who should come, but the iealous knaue her husband, and a rabble of his companions at his heeles, thither prouoked and instigated by his distemper. And what to do thinke you? to search for his wiues loue. Euen so, plainly so.
            
            
               For.
               While ye were there?
            
            
               Fal.
               Whilst I was there.
            
            
               For.
               And did he search and could not find you?

               Of a pack, Hilt to point, heele to head: and then to
               Be stewed in my owne grease like a Dutch dish:
               A man of my kidney; by the Lord it was maruell I
               Escaped suffication; and in the heat of all this,
               To be throwne into Thames like a horshoo hot:

The feruent loue I beare to young Anne Page,
               
               And mutally her loue againe to mee:
               But her father still against her choise,
               Doth seeke to marrie her to foolish Slender,
               
               And in a robe of white this night disguised,
               Wherein fat Falstaffe had a mightie scare,
               Must Slender take her and carrie her to Catlen,
               
               And there vnknowne to any, marrie her.
               Now her mother still against that match,
               And firme for Doctor Cayus, in a robe of red
               By her deuice, the Doctor must steale her thence,
               And she hath giuen consent to goe with him.
            
            
               Host.
               Now which means she to deceiue, father or mother?
            
            
               Fen.
               Both my good Host, to go along with me.

               And tarrie readie at the appointment place,
               To giue our harts vnited matrimonie.

               That hath sweet Nan and I agreed vpon,
               And by a robe of white, the which she weares,
               With ribones pendant flaring bout her head,
               
                  I shalbe sure to know her, and conuey her thence,
               And bring her where the priest abides our cōming,
               And by thy furtherance there be married.
            
            
               Host.
               Well, husband your deuice, Ile to the Vicar,
               Bring you the maide, you shall not lacke a Priest.

               Exit omnes.
               Enter sir Iohn with a Bucks head vpon him.
            
            
               Fal.
               This is the third time, well Ile venter,

                  Ioue transformed himselfe into a bull,
               
                  
And I am here a Stag, and I thinke the fattest
               In all Windsor forrest: well I stand here
               For Horne the hunter, waiting my Does comming.
               Enter mistris Page, and mistris Ford.

               Welcome Ladies.

               I I sir Iohn, I see you will not faile,
               Therefore you deserue far better then our loues,
               But it grieues me for your late crosses.

               Mis. Pa.
               God forgiue me, what noise is this?
               There is a noise of hornes, the two women run away.
               Enter sir Hugh like a Satyre, and boyes drest like Fayries, mistresse Quickly, like the Queene of Fayries: they sing a song about him, and afterward speake.
            
            
               Quic:
               You Fayries that do haunt these shady groues,
               Looke round about the wood if you can espie
               A mortall that doth haunt our sacred round:
               If such a one you can espie, giue him his due,
               And leaue not till you pinch him blacke and blew:
               Giue them their charge Puck ere they part away.
            
            
               Sir Hu.
               Come hither Peane, go to the countrie houses,
               And when you finde a slut that lies a sleepe,
               And all her dishes foule, and roome vnswept,
               With your long nailes pinch her till she crie,
               
                  
And sweare to mend her sluttish huswiferie.
            
            
               Fai.
               I warrant you I will performe your will.
            
            
               Hu.
               Where is Pead? go you & see where Brokers sleep,
               And Foxe-eyed Seriants with their mase,
               Goe laie the Proctors in the street,
               And pinch the lowsie Seriants face:
               Spare none of these when they are a bed,
               But such whose nose lookes plew and red.
            
            
               Quic.
               Away begon, his mind fulfill,
               And looke that none of you stand still.
               Some do that thing, some do this,
               All do something, none amis.
            
            
               Hir Hu.
               I smell a man of middle earth.
            
            
               Fal.
               God blesse me from that wealch Fairie.
            
            
               Quic.
               Looke euery one about this round,
               And if that any here be found,
               For his presumption in this place,
               Spare neither legge, arme, head, nor face.
            
            
               Sir Hu.
               See I haue spied one by good luck,
               His bodie man, his head a buck.
            
            
               Fal.
               God send me good fortune now, and I care not.
            
            
               Quic.
               Go strait, and do as I commaund,
               And take a Taper in your hand,
               And set it to his fingers endes,
               And if you see it him offends,
               And that he starteth at the flame,
               Then is he mortall, know his name:
               If with an F. it doth begin,
               Why then be shure he is full of sin.
               About it then, and know the truth,
               Of this same metamorphised youth.
            
            
               Hir Hu.
               Giue me the Tapers, I will try
               And if that he loue venery.
               
                  
They put the Tapers to his fingers, and he starts.
            
            
               Sir Hu.
               It is right indeed, he is full of lecheries and iniquitie.
            
            
               Quic.
               A little distant from him stand,
               And euery one take hand in hand,
               And compasse him within a ring,
               First pinch him well, and after sing.
               Here they pinch him, and sing about him, & the Doctor comes one way & steales away a boy in red. And Slender another way he takes a boy in greene: And Fenton steales misteris Anne, being in white. And a noyse of hunting is made within: and all the Fairies runne away. Falstaffe pulles of his bucks head, and rises vp. And enters M. Page, M. Ford, and their wiues, M. Shallow, Sir Hugh.
            
            
               Fal.
               
                  Horne the hunter quoth you: am I a ghost?
               Sblood the Fairies hath made a ghost of me:
               What hunting at this time at night?
               Ile lay my life the mad Prince of Wales

               God saue you sir Iohn Falstaffe.
               
            
            
               Sir Hu.
               God plesse you sir Iohn, God plesse you.
            
            
               Pa.
               Why how now sir Iohn, what a pair of horns in your hand?
            
            
               Ford.
               Those hornes he ment to place vpon my head,
               And M. Brooke and he should be the men:
               Why how now sir Iohn, why are you thus amazed?
               We know the Fairies man that pinched you so,
               Your throwing in the Thames, your beating well,
               
                  
And whats to come sir Iohn, that can we tell.
            
            
               Mi. Pa.
               Sir Iohn tis thus, your dishonest meanes
               To call our credits into question,
               Did make vs vndertake to our best,
               To turne your leaud lust to a merry Iest.

               Iest, tis well, haue I liued to these yeares
               To be gulled now, now to be ridden?
               Why then these were not Fairies?
               
            
            
               Mis. Pa.
               No sir Iohn but boyes.
            
            
               Fal.
               By the Lord I was twice or thrise in the mind
               They were not, and yet the grosnesse
               Of the fopperie perswaded me they were.
               Well, and the fine wits of the Court heare this,
               Thayle so whip me with their keene Iests,
               That thayle melt me out like tallow,
               Drop by drop out of my grease. Boyes!
            
            
               Sir Hu.
               I trust me boyes Sir Iohn: and I was
               Also a Fairie that did helpe to pinch you.
            
            
               Fal.
               I, tis well I am your May-pole,
               You haue the start of mee,
               Am I ridden too with a wealch goate?
               With a peece of toasted cheese?
            
            
               Sir Hu.
               Butter is better then cheese sir Iohn,
               
               You are all butter, butter.
            
            
               For.
               There is a further matter yet sir Iohn,
               
               There's 20. pound you borrowed of M. Brooke Sir Iohn,
               
               And it must be paid to M. Ford Sir Iohn.
               
            
            
               Mi. For.
               Nay husband let that go to make amēds,
               Forgiue that sum, and so weele all be friends.
            
            
               For.
               Well here is my hand, all's forgiuen at last.
            
            
               Fal.
               It hath cost me well,
               I haue bene well pinched and washed.
               
                  
Enter the Doctor.
            
            
               Mi. Pa.

               Pa.
               Nay be not angry wife, Ile tell thee true,
               It was my plot to deceiue thee so:
               And by this time your daughter's married
               To M. Slender, and see where he comes.
               Enter Slender.
               Now sonne Slender,
               
               Where's your bride?
            
            
               Slen.
               Bride, by Gods lyd I thinke theres neuer a man in the worell hath that crosse fortune that I haue: begod I could cry for verie anger.
            
            
               Pa.
               Why whats the matter sonne Slender?
               
            
            
               Slen.
               Sonne, nay by God I am none of your son.
            
            
               Pa.
               No, why so?
            
            
               Slen.
               Why so God saue me, tis a boy that I haue married.
            
            
               Pa.
               How a boy? why did you mistake the word?
            
            
               Slen.
               No neither, for I came to her in red as you bad me, and I cried mum, and hee cried budget, so well as euer you heard, and I haue married him.
            
            
               Sir Hu.
