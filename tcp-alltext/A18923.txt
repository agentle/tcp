            To the indifferent and intelligent Reader.
            
               NOt knowing (and that not-knowing a greuous tētatiō) whether God shall giue me to cōtinue, or necessarisy to Conuert my studies another waie (for vnder this or that colour, wee are not as Drones to eate not laboring, as the manner of some howsecreepers is) & setting before mine eies, what may for the present he best fitted to the churchesgood: without al respect of persons I hādled th'insuing argument Of sacrifices and finally concluded, for remoouing som scandalous behauiour A reason of this Epistle. towards me (for these

nine years at least) to preface my saide booke, with an Epistle of such nature, as followeth. Et sic ab origine pandā.
            
            Aboute some 9. y. since, residing then at Amsterdam in Nether-land, in an Epistle, prefixed to my Treatise of the Sin against the Ho. Ghost. I (for the effect) concluded as followeth,
            1. First that certaine heere This certaine. were more then now would be knowne: for som are turred for meer aduantage: 
                     〈◊〉

                     •…
                  ey be mar tins disciples, still. at home, labouring for Reformation in an ouercariage of wordes (as such and such persōs, ordinations & administrations &c were Antichristian, badges of the beast, &c) they thereby ministred occasiō of Separatiō
                from our Church: as Brown is said at first to do, & many soules since least otherwise (as they say) they shoulde drinke of

the pure wine of Gods wrath.
            
            2. Secondly I there auerred, that such Separists ministred occasiō of further inquirie. As, if the Church, ministrie and sacraments, left behind in the English church be Antichristian, then how is it possble that Them-selues so separated should either be possessed of true faith, or true baptisme: seeing Antichrist teacheth, leadeth and sealeth to himselfe and the Deuill his parent, & not to christ For say they, out of a bitter fountaine can issue no sweet water: & as the root is, such be the branches. Whereupon insued that some such separists did forthwith willingly and freely root vp their former faith touching Christ, as

also, puffe of the former Baptisme: one first baptising himselfe, and then hee baptising others (as Abraham first circumcised himselfe and then others) so sinning I feare the fearefull sin against the Holy Ghost. Only, one thing may be a lette to their committing of that sin, if so happily, the spirituall sight and sense supposed to haue been in them, were neuer indeed, so deepely setled in them.
            That Epistle comming ouer to London, ô vvhat a storme the Diuell there raised for smiting the corners of silly Iobs house? And my selfe comming ouer about a yeare after, how did a sort of supposed reformists flie vpon my credit couched in my Bookes and Sermons, as the Shabeans and

Chaldeans ceazed on Iobes substance, charging diuers their disciples, to fly all consultation with Clapham or his writings, euē as they shold flie poison. The case so stan ding, I sent them word by some of their hearers, that if they would denie, they had defined of Antichristianity as I had charged them afore; or that granting they had so taughte, they would yet denie that se paration frō our Church cold necessarily be inferred therefrom; that then I would be rea die to cleare the one and the other, either by word or writinge, as they shoulde thinke beste. S

                  d surdis auribus, what they had done, they had done: & I was not a man to bee talked withall. And so

forwards they went in theire euill, & by coloured craftines drew many simple harted people after them, in a blind kind of schisme. And this not only within the Citty, but also abroad they practised, to the abusing of many. Had they had the power of our Bishops, doubtlesse they would haue imprisoned me, and had they had the power of our Prince, without all question, they would, haue slaine mee. They can speake against the power they haue not, but had they that they would, it would be greater then that which others with vs haue, euen a power for trampeling Kinges, crownes and scepters vnder theire feet, little or nothing differing

from Papall supremacy. Hee that knowes not that, is very sillily acquainted with the too true stories of our times, and the positiue doctrines of principall leaders in that kind. But to proceed.
            VVhile thus they labored to make men hate mee and my labors, I toiled in my ministry, wheresoeuer the dore of vtterance was opened vnto me, and God mercifully gaue vnto me the holy likengs of many. Yea, some of these, that had beene charged not to heare me, did (God beeing mercifull vnto them) repaire to my Sermons, concluding vvith themselues to vvalke by the Apostles rule, namely, to try all things, and then keepe that is good. In fine, they perceaued how they had beene hoodwinked,
               
and bursting out of Som yet in the ministry as Fa'coners do lead the people hood winked they know not whither: looking for their day, as the Papistes for theyr day: hauing one speeche in publique & another

            The worke so proceedinge on both sides, let me by the way tell the gentle reader, how a welwiller of mine, dealte with a foe of mine, for causing him against the purpose of his heart, to iustify mee and my labours. And thus it was. My Tables of houshold

of persons. These Tables, my friend brought to a certaine Sectarie, desiring his iudgemente vppon these Tables. The Sectary espying the Preachers name belowe, doth take them (for had hee seene my name, hee woulde not haue looked vpon them) and then he falls on reading Anon, he burstes out into such patheticall speeches: Ey marry sir, this is indeede to the purpose: O hee is a rare man &c: My friend hauing gotte what he expected, did thereuppon pull the paisted name off, and pointed him to the Authour thereof, Henoch Clapham. The Sectarie seeing that, O how blank hee was, hee stoode as one looking on Medusaes head,

and so my friende left him. Apiteous thing, that hearers shall affect men rather then matter, praising and dispraysing they know not what. But had they beene taught better, then would they (happilie) haue learned better.
            For an ordinarye thing it is, with that people and the Separistes to proclayme all Dunses, No-scholers, &c: that differ from them; but beeing one with them, then they bee verye learned, and what not? But againe to my fo

            Some few scholers aboute the Cittie, hauing so proclaymed mee an aduersarye to theyr laicail discipline (not onelye to the banding of Citizens against mee, but also

of others in the Country) haue they not since been opposite to themselues? Then mark: They being of the nōber that petitio nated to the King for Reformation (not to speake of some then reconciled to the Bishops, at least outwardly) I beseech you, what doe they speak of their Lay-Elders (for wee all grant Elders) what speake they of their Lay-deacōs for wee all graunt Deacons) what say they of their Lay discipline (for we all graunt discipline) what say they to the King of these matters, wherewith they had intoxicate the heads and harts of their hearers? They speak not a word, not so much as God saue it. They onely couet some other by-things, and then all is well inough, the former Antichristianitie

shall be all true (or at least, tollerable) christianity.
            But methinks I heare some say, that howbeit they desired not of the King an intertainment of the former discipline: yet they neuer the lessewer of the same opinion still, but propounded it not, for that the King seemed aduerse vnto it. I answere, it is vntrue, for many of them had changed their opinion. In somuch as amongst them the case so stood: some few did faintly hold Three sondry Sects vnder one Gener

            Being so diuided into three heade of opinion, touching the very Persons that shoulde exercise discipline, they coulde

not in one petitiō beg al three nor coulde the king graunte moe then one, and therefore no one sort propounded.

Gentle Reader, consider of it soberly, and the Lorde giue thee vnderstanding in al things. Looke how I taxed them at first, they haue made it good at the last. But how many of them haue the grace to laie downe their enmitie towards me, to confesse their euill, and accordingly to make satisfaction? well, if I haue spoken euill, beare witnesse of the euill, but if it bee but trueth, why still doe they smite mee? The trueth is greate and will conquer, and better for them to be subdued vnto it, then subdued of it. As for their followers, let them beware they followe them not in euill, howsoeuer it be their duety to reuerence their good. Be followers of all, as they be followers of Christ, but not further.
            
               
That many thinges amongst vs neede amendment, who knowes not, and what honest hearte lamentes not? And that it is the duetye of euery soule, so farre as calling and meanes extende, to labour such amendemente, euerye discreet person graunteth.
            But if the lawes of our Land bee truely considered, euills bee rather Personall, then Legall, and the abuse in persons, must not condemne the lawfull vse of things.
            Let vs striue in mutuall exhortations daielie, while it is called to day, but (as the Apostle commaundeth) Let all our thinges bee done in loue: for without loue, all

our talke of faith, hope, knowledge, will bee but as the noise of a tinckling Cimball, a noyse, no voice: and that will neuer (or seldome) bringe any edification to the hearers.
            And thus gentle reader, hoping that by other mens harms God will giue thee to beware as also the heart of entertaining good counsaile, how base, poore, or otherwise soeuer the counsellor bee, I leaue thee to the sequell of diuine Sacrifice, which the Lorde make blessed vnto thee. In receiuing good by it, giue to GOD the praise, and for mee to god thy praiers, speciallie, that it woulde please GOD, to giue som timely issue out of my present tentation.

This holy father continued the ceremony of faith; as also, vpon a peculiar commandement, offereth Beastes, and birds vndiuided, in Gen. 15. whereupon he is told, that his seed should be a stranger and afflicted, 400. yeares, and that in land not theirs, that is, as the auncient Rabanus Maurus (from Eusebius) wel noteth, not onely in AEgypte, but also in the first vnpurged

The same nomber, from the Gospel preached to Abram vnto the giuing of the two tabled lawe at mounte Sinai in the wildernesse, is pressed of

the apostle, when to the Galatians he saith thus; The law which was 430 yeeres after the Gospell was preached to Abram, cannot disanull that couenant, that was confirmed before of GOD in respecte of Christ, that it shoulde make the promise of none effect.

               A DISCOVRSE VPON Leuiticus. 1.
            
               Section. 1.
               
                  THIS booke is tearmed of the christiā church

imposed vpon the tribe of Leui, one of the twelue families deriued from old Iacob or Israel. wherupon also, these ceremonies are ordinarilye termed. Leuiticall ceremonies.
               
               The booke (in the originall) beginneth thus: vai

                     krá ael Móshe, vaiedabar Iehouah &c. word for word thus, And he cryed vnto Moses (euen) the lord spake &c, where the first letter V in proprietie signifieth AND, howsoeuer somtimes it couples not, but explaineth somewhat afore spokē: which

letter V (called Vah) did euen so begin Exodus, & likewise beginneth the following book of Nombers, kniting so the books Genesis, Exodus, Leuiticus & Nombers togither. As for Deuteronomy, it is not so coopled, for that it is but a repetition of the things of Moses. The coo pling of the first fowre books of Moses togither, doth so teach vs one & the same faith, sealed by god the father in his son: as also, that the same Leui discouered in Genesis, & taught the forme of a diuine house or tabernacle

in Exodus is the same to whō the publick form of worship is prescribed in Leuiticus, & whose parioch-peple (with certain their gests) is counted in Nombers. Som resēblāce may be between these 4 books & the 4 Euangel▪ Gen. begins with the word whereby all was made, S. Iohn with the same word made flesh, for effecting a better creation thē the natural. For how soere S. Iohns Euan. is pla ced last of mā, yet of the word incarnate, hee was most highly beloued, & writ of that word most

highlie. Exodus beginneth with the generation of Israel, that went down into Egipt, and S. Mathew beginneth with Iesus (which came of that generation according to the flesh) who also of his Israelitish parentes, was had into Egipt; till out of Egipt God called his son. The book of Leuiticus beginneth with sacrifice imposed on Leui, & S. Luke beginneth also with Zacharie a Leuite sacrificing, and informed touching Him, that was the end of that ceremoniall lawe. The

booke of Nombers beginns with a Catalogue of the Heades of Israell, with their naturall generation: and the Gospell according to S. Marke, beginneth with the spirituall Heades of the Church, by whome was continued the spirituall Israel of God. As for Deuteronomy, contayuing the seuerall Gests of Israel, it may well bee matched with the Acts and Gests of the Apostles, who with their spirituall weapons didde more, then al the natural Israell could with theyr

carnall weapons & warfare. As for any doctrine in the olde Testament taught after the bookes of Moses, it was to haue his reference to, and his ground in Moses: & euen so, the doctrin, einsuing the former writings, of the 4 Euangelists, was in nothing thereto, to bee contradictorye. This booke of Leuiticus diuideth it selfe into ceremoniall Persons, and ceremoniall things.
               
            
            
               
               Section. 2.
               
                  THe ceremoniall Persons are of 2. Ceremonial persons. sorts, the first is God himselfe, the secōd is the people of God: the terme Ceremoniall I giue as an Attribute vnto God, for that he manifests himselfe vnto his people, no otherwise then by ceremony or sacramentall signes. Such Ceremonyes or signes of his presence, as

were the fiery piller and clowd in the wildernes: And such was the externall sound of the word, in the eares of Adam and al the anciēt patriarchs, as also to vs at this day. But here in this book of Leuiticus he plentifully declares his might, iustice, mercy &c. vnder types and ceromoniall shadowes. And how shold the creatur which is finite, attaine to anie knowledge of the creator in whome all is infinite, sauing by his humbling himselfe vnto vs by some finite forms (for

so the Gentiles behoulding Rom. 1. Psal. 19. 1. the visible creature came to som knowledge of the inuisible creator) and that argues also his exceeding loue towards vs, who will vouchsafe (as vnto Moses) a view of his back, when otherwise wee coulde not behold his face and liue.
               The ceremoniall people be the twelue tribes of Israell, whereof one tribe is of the Lord assumed for the work of the ministry, & that is Le
                        •…
                     i: the other eleauen trybes are left to bee administred vnto, and they bee

the trybes of Iudah, Beniamin, Reuben, Simeon, Zebulun, Issachar, Dan, Gad, Asher, Nephtali, Ioseph; which one of Ioseph, is somtimes considered in the families of his two sons, Ephraim & Manasses.
               
               Now for the ministring Tribe, Leui, euery familye thereof did not minister alike, for those that came of his Sonne Kohath, were deputed to the peculiar function of priesthood; but such as came of his other two sons, Gershom and Merari 
                  Nom. 3. & 4. & 18. they were allotted vnto

inferior seruices, as appeareth largelye in the booke of Nombers: neither these that came of Kohath, were all alike interessed in the priestlye function, for Aaron (and so the eldest after him, by ordinarie rule) were preferred in the office, as going before the rest, in daily alter-duty: as also onely appointed and allowed to enter into the thirde part (the most secret part) of the Tabernacle, called the holy of holies. All which (not to presse the misteries large ly handled in my thirde

and fourth parte of my laboures on Salomons songue) doth commend to the Church for euer, the Equity, first of sufficiency; secondly of order for publique administration of diuine duties.
               Sufficiency of these Leuites appeared, first in being free from all bodily Leuit. 21. 17. &c. vnsoundnesse and vnproportionability; seing filthy diseases and lacke of some member, would debarre them, though Leuites. This no doubt in Figure did fignifie, that the Archprieste of our profession, shoulde bee

voyde of blemish and lackes, for the integrall worke of our redemption. But yet not only this but that the subordinate of Christ should bee (as Paule speaketh) Kosmios, turned somtimes Modest; 
                  1 Tim. 3. 2. The word Kosmios, is expounded. but in the nature & propriety of the word, it signifieth a seemlinesse, neatnesse, and all in proportion & good order; such as the frame of the World is, set out of Gods hand: whereupon man is tearmed in the good sense, Micro-cosmos, a little world. And cōsider anye of the prophets or

Apostles, or Euangelists called of God and christ Iesus, & it seemeth that the rule was sanctified by their example, seing wee neuer heare of any vnfeatured person, allotted vnto such superintēdency. The peoples weaknes (doubtles) was in such case tendered, for that they be ouerready to except and flout at any infirmitye in the minister. But yet, this beeing a let to the entrance (whereas necessity causeth not a dispensation from the common rule) it intendeth not a lawfull occasion

of remoouing any from the ministry, who since their entrāce haue accidentally mette with such wants, while they haue behaued thēselues worthy their function.
               Secondly, the sufficiency of these Leuits appeared Nom. 4 43. compared with chap. 8. 24. &c. by their fulnes of age, in that, first they might not enter into the seruice of the Tabernacle, vntill they were fiue and twenty yeares aged; nor secondlie, might the Kohathites attend the altar, vntill they were thirtie; nor were they to continue in that laboursom

seruice, after once they were fifty, howsoeuer afterwards to be trusted with things cōmitted to their charge, concerning the good of the sanctuary. Their experienced faithfulnes, deserued such trust: but their weaker years, deserued a freedom frō killing the sacrifices & other laborius trauails. The equity hereof continueth still Cyprian. d

at twelue yeares of age?) who entred not into the publique administration of ministry, vntil hee begon to bee about 30. Nor can the phrase of Presbyter or Elder intend lesse, which was a terme giuen to the Euangelical ministry, and not to Lay-aldermen. I know that Timothy was a yong man, but not a young scholer (hauing bin trained vp in scriptures of a child) and in like case, I doubte not the Church now may dispence with the generall Canon. But for the common rule,

it requireth sufficient agednes, seing commonly very few in few years attaine to sufficiency; else the order of vniuersities should be held superstitious, where after the study of Arts & tongs. so many years are required for attaining degrees worthy the profession of diuinity. For the other point namely, of beeing allowed to surcease such trauaile at 50. I doubt not of the lawfulnes stil (for who in their best yeares are sufficient for these things?) seeing ordinarilye about these

years, quick conceipt is dulled, memory weakened, and strength vtterly is lacking for preaching in season and out of season, publiquely and priuately thorough euerye housholde. But while they rest, som other must take paines. The worke of the Lord must not be done negligently. Me thinks I now doe heare som Nouelists say, neuer was sincere preacher of this latter opinion. Yes forsooth, not to alleadge others, one whome you cannot (or at leaste, will not) except against, was

so minded. Master Greenham leauing his pastoral cure at Draiton by Cambridge (as publick bruite went then amongst his welwillers) did alledge this lawe of 50. as a very sufficient cause of desisting his former laborious charge: howsoeuer hee afterwardes heere at Londō, imploied himself in dooing good as hee could. 3.

that all such as desire ecclesiastick superintēdency, they shold be apt to teach no Neophyt, able to stop the mouth of gainsaiers &c. for that without such qualifi catiō, there cā be no true Bishop or Presbiter, that being the very life & essence of a Pastor or elder. The apostle requires sundrye other particular vertues to the more com mendable beeing of a Pastor, but not to his essentiall beeing (for then, where should we meete with one true Minister?) it being a perfect example for shaping foorthe a

minister; euen as there is a perfecte example of a common Christian, wherafter hee is to contend, when as Christ saieth, Be perfect as your heauenly father is perfect. And as it were grosse absurdity to Mat. 5. 48. conclude thus, No one that is not perfect as God is perfect, can be held for a true Christian: euen so absurd it is to say, No one is a true Pastor or Presbyter, that is not absolutely qualified in all vertues as the Apostle requireth. Tully defineth an Orator at such a pitch of perfection, as none could euer attayne

to, & Plato draweth out such a common wealth, as none euer in this worlde did or shall see: was it Tullies meaninge therefore to conclude there was no true Orator to be found; or Platoes meaning that therefore there was no true respublique in the whole world?

The seuen Churches of Asia to whom S. Iohn writ, each of them had one superiour teacher, tearmed by the name Angel (in sense one with the term Apostle) which is in English a Messenger, or one thats sent, namely to preache

the Gospell. Can it easily be thought that there were no moe in anye of them churches, to assiste the other in teaching? It possible cannot bee: the Churches in al probability, being of some large continuance, and the Churches being also city churches, not country Churches: and therefore of the Greeks called Me tropolitan Churches: for in the chiefest cities, the first churches were planted. Nay, to put it out of doubt, when the Apostle S. Paul sent from Miletum

of that Church, loe there came diuerse, that were Elders or ouer seers in that Church, all apt to teach, & therefore all of them charged with the same worke hee had there vndergone. One of these being particularly charged by Saint Iohn, it argueth he had a superiority ouer the rest of the ouerseers, so wel as ouer the people; or else Saint Iohn would haue directed his Epistle, not to the angell, but To the angels of the Church of Ephesus. Worthilye therefore is that parity of ministrye

hissed out of the church. And if King Dauid might (out of his sanctified discretion) constitute seuerall Orders as before: yea, if Mordecai might ordaine a festiuall day for their deliuerāce from Hamans Pur, and Iudas Machaheus a (a)

If they lay a yoake vppon the people which they themselues will not beare,

therein they shal sin. But for their Right in such cases, it is no waye lessened by the appearaunce of Christ, but rather enlarged: seing the former wer in their state of non-age: but these (so well as the whole Christian church) are by Christ Iesus, com to their Ful-age to the further ripening of their discretion. And thus I haue briefly cleared the harmonye abiding between the anciēt and new ministry.
               For the second sort of Ceremoniall people, it was the eleuen Trybes

of Israel afore spoken of, which figured out the whole of Gods people, that were to be gathered vnto Christ (the perfecte Preuatler with god, figured by that one Israel or Iaacob, whereof all the 12. tribes came) in respecte whereof the apostle termeth Galat. 6. 15. 16. all such, the Israell of God. And therefore the seuerall Cognisaunces and qualities attributed by Iacob and Moses vpon their propheticall deathbeds, doe liuely figure out, the diuersity of guifts and qualities in the new testamentes

Church; one and the same spirit working diuersly: not to speake of discommendable qualities, which were neuer worse in the first, then be in the last. But what the people represented, the Tabernacle represented; and therefore to that.

in the fiftth part of my labors vpon Salomons songue, and the eleuenth lection, thither I refer the reader.

                  without, & make ready thy things in the field, & after build thine house) it not only teacheth, that God by his word and spirite, first hammereth euerie

soule of his apart, and then brings them into a glorious vnion with peaceable affection (like to the first Church at Ierusalem, where all were of one hart and minde) but also, that euery christian (much more ministers and maiestrates) shold, ayming at a generall, first looke to their particulars; & they once fitted, it is a matter of no stirre to vnite them for the generall. Oratours had that witte for framing their Orations; but Diuines

often lacke that care, for well composing bookes and sermons. And yet the lord (imitated of the Carpenter) gaue that example in the worlds creation, that first one particular and then another should be hewed out of the confused Chaos or Lump; and then lastlie vnited in one, for effecting the vniuerse or generall called the world. 5. As for the decaye of Tabernacle & Temple, wherupon followed necessarily a repairing and mending thereof, it well importeth, not only externall

wants that are to be supplied of the more able; but also, such spirituall wants as will continually break out, wherin the infirme are to bee supported of the stronger, and to be couered with Loue, as Shem and Iaphet couered Noah with a mantle, whereby they gotte that blessing, which separating flowting Chamistes, partake not of. 6. The scattering of the tabernacles parts, and the consuming of the Temple by fire, carying the holy vessels into captiuity, they fitly denote.

The churches scattering in the time of tempestes and fierye affliction, yea, the carying of them away captiue by the strong hand of Antichrists army. 7. Lastly, the new erection of the Temple, it beeing made more excellēt (as Haggai foresawe) by Christ his bodily appearance therin: Hagg. 2. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. it well foreshadowed the happy return of the Church, from out all affliction: yea, out of the earths rubbish and ashes (after the long sleepe of all flesh) what time the Ioy of al nations shal mak

Galat. 6: 6) but the inferior ministry are indebted to the superiour, as their Ouerseers in the

Secondly, it followeth not, tha because it was ceremo niall togither with sacrifice, that therfore it must cease with sacrifice, (no more then because the Tabernacle & Temple,

and ministers were ceremoniall, therefore all ecclesiastique houses & ministers are to be abolished) but rather this; looke what ceremoniall signification the Tenth might haue, that ceaseth with Christ: as the ceremoniall signification of the bullock, Sheep, goat, did: but not therfore the number of Ten, nor the vse of Beasts abolished: To vse them continueth, but not to vse them so.

But as finest flowers soonest

vanish, so that deuotion soone cooled. And that may appeare in the Apo stles much pressing the Churches, with the conscionable care they ought to haue, of all due prouision for their ministry, as hauing already lost their first loue in that matter, & if in that, then also their first loue was lost to the holy religion.

But ô base age we liue in; men seeke honour in dishonoring the ministry, but an honour that sticks to their houses & mannors accordingly, to the very gnawing & consuming of their names and houses, from the face of the earth.

marueile if the latter came a little neerer the marke, whē they had first the eies of their ancients to see by, & then theyr own for prying a little deeper. But of all the ancients, Origen was about

                  Origen deserued best, in asmuch (for any thing I see) al the rest of them (euen vnto this last age) did speak almost nothing, which argued not their candle to haue receiued light from his. O that hee had beene so happy, in establishing the Letter! In this last age sundry haue aduentured on Leuiticus, but in our

language almost none. And these that haue writ ten (with far better successe then the ancients) I wold I could add vnto thē, but euen that which I see to be lacking. But it is far easier to espie a defect in a building, then to amend it. Why then shold I write? For these causes: first, for that the Leuiticall ceremony is in our language almost vnhandled, except in generall termes: 2, for that I hope to make sōwhat I handle (euē the substāce of it) more plain then for rainers haue, who rather

writte for satisfaction of scholers, thē of the common people.
               But in the very beginning, I heartily lament one lack in them, which for any thing I see, must remaine a lacke still for me. Some haue diuided and subdiuided, dichotomizd and subdichotomizd the kinds of sacrifice, labouring so to put euery kind into his own place. But alas, not once able to say what the sacrifice in the 1. chapter is, in respect of the particul

for the time it was to be administred, it so hath come to passe, that ignorance of this, hath made their diuision imperfect; yea sometimes distinct sacrifices by this sorte haue been confounded. The consideration wherof (I labouring of the same disease) doth moue me to passe by that strait and to cast aboute for more sea-roome.

                     offrings. Of this kind, were

flowr, oyle, frankinsence, salt, eares of corne. And in the offring vp of this kind, they thankfully acknowleged, that al came from God wherewithall they were sustayned. It was through the goodnes Leuit. 26. Deut. 28. of god, that the staffe (or strength) of their bread was not brokē; yea that their dough was not cursed in the trough; & that which is more, that their bread was not blasted in the eare, or spoiled with mel dewe. By which breade also, they were ledde vnto him that is the bread of life.

But ô prophane times we liue in! Our people haue long heard our Sa uiour say in S. Iohns gospell; Labour not for the meate which perisheth, but for the meate that endureth vnto euerlasting life, which the Son of man shall giue vnto you: but who looks after this? who holds out the hand and saith, Lord giue vs euer of this bread, feed vs with this immortall meate? Nay, how many whose bodies are fed daily with bodily foode, doe lift vp then heart and say, I thanke

thee ô Lord for this bodily refection; how great is thy kindnesse to feede me thus at thy charges, who haue not deserued so much as the crums that fall from thy table: yea, which rather haue merited that euery crum should haue bin a curse, and euery draughte of drink, a draught of thine indignation. Of old they did write in their Halls beyond their sidetables,

                     Sits down like a Neat, & rises like an Asse
                  
But togither with long side-tables, it seemeth grace is much gone. For

commonly we now giue either a naked grace to God, without any grace to the poore: or else wee arise resolued to giue grace neither to god nor the poore. A wondrous thing, that God shoulde not smite the meate in our mouths (as he dealt with the Israelites) or rather, that he shoulde not smite the earth with a barraine womb (as somtime he smit the figtree) that so neuer more fruit might grow vpon it. Mincha in Leuit. 2.
               
               This offring of the inanimate creature (called Mincha, a resemblance

whereof is had in our sacramentall Supper) it passed through fire, arguing once, that the interest we haue in the crea tures, did cost Christ Iesus the setting on, he fried for our benefit: as also, that wee must not thinke to eate our bread without all affliction & firy triall (for heere wee must be made S. Laurēces & bee cast into the fornace with the 3. yoong gentlemen of Iudah) only let vs labor that (as this meat offring had in it oyl & salt so) we may be possest with the oyl of gladwhich

Christ had aboue all his fellows, and so we shall not bee destitute of ioyfulnes in midst of all fiery tryals. As also let vs labour to haue salt in our selues for the seasoning of others by our vncorrupted word and workes, keeping our hearts alwaies free from the leauen of malitiousnes So shall our praises and thanksgiuings bee, sweet sauour vnto God truely ioyous to our selues, and edifying to o thers. So much briefely of the Eucharistique oblation; with which, the

wise-hearted may Analogically compare the supper of our Lord.

euery syllable, and the garments of Aaron and the whole Leuiticall Order, (spirant caelestia sacramēta) do breath forth sacraments, or mysteries. That hee saith of the whole, I may much more saye of this sorte of sacrifices, which in Christ & his mystical body be so deeply sealed as they squeaze out blud againe, and pierce and presse out the verye life of nature.
               Hitherto I haue not set the ceremony on the rack (as hath been vsuall with too manye, strayning the ceremonye to

their wits, and not their wits to the ceremony; & I would such vnproportionable and fantastique straines were not at this daye forced on plainer scriptures also) but I waighed the ceremonye by the plain, open waits of the sanctuary, for causing the sence to fall out fully & euidentlye to the conscionable Reader of the scriptures. It remaineth stil, that I keepe the kings hy-way, & not for satisfactiō of verball spirits (nam haud vnquā aliud seculū tam verbosū) I shold abounde with manner

beyond matter; or take vp the time with by respectes of the animate creatures (which out of nature might bee many) to the weakning and obseuring of the mayn end and purpose of the Holy ghost, And so to the mat ter.
               All Sin-sacrifice (as afore) did properly require Heb. 9. 22. blood (for without blood no purgation) whereupon it is probable, that Cain offring an oblation of the fruits of the earth (termed in Leuit. 2. mincha) did proudly intend a Thanksgiuing without

humiliation for sinne; when as Abel rather looked to his sin, and came to the Lord in humilitie for the purgation thereof, by the blud of a lamb. This beeing ind

Israels congregatiō or church could sin, notwithstanding al the neer

helpes they had from God, and cannot the church now much more sinne? I would it did not. The Prince of the people then stood need of a sacrifice, and do not our Princes and rulers stand in as much neede? Yea, their sacrifice was to be presented in an He-goat for that they are not only to be as He-goats before the flocke for comming out

proceeded first from ignorance. For which respect (among others) the peoples sin afterwards is represented in a She-goat more weak in euill then the former.

               The sin sacrifices hitherto spoken of, intend sin committed first of Ignorance: therefore

in the sixt chapter, the holy ghost laieth downe a sacrifice for such as haue sinned of knowledg. For the opposite vnto ignorance is not willingnes but knowledge.

               All the sacrifices thē spoken of in this section ar either offred vp for sin don of Ignorāce, or otherwis (through infirmitie) cōmitted of Knowledge.

after knowledge, least it eat vp all conscience & leaue no place for repentance. I am not ignorant that manye haue spoken much of this sin against the Holy-ghoste, but grounded on their owne surmises, not on diuine scriptures. Peter Lombard (the great master of sentences) hath laboured to define it, but it stickes as bird-lime on his fingers, and needes some wiser then S. Thomas a watering to wash his fingers on it.

               There be also in Gen. 31, 54, & 1 Sam, 9, 12, & 1 Kings, 1921, speaches of Zebachs, which some haue taken for sacrifices, as also, that the people were feasted with these holy things. The worde indeed in Zebach in all

               The sacrifice remayning to bee handled, is that in Leuit. 1. which also is a sacrifice for expiation of sinne, seeing it draweth blood with it; and without blood no remission. The matter ex qua whereof it consisteth, is Animate creatures, and they be of two sorts: the first be Beasts, the second be byrds. The Beasts againe be of two sortes, the first of the

                  heard, as the Bullock; the second of the Flocke, as Sheepe and goates. As for the Birds, they be also of two sorts, Turtle-doues & Pigeons.

particularly mentioned, nor in anye writer well obserued. When as a sacrifice intimated some one or moe their particular wants, we find it (as afore) bounded in his form and vse. But in this not so. It causeth mee therfore to thinke, that this oblation intimated not this or that particular need; but rather, that it was (as Noahs sacrifice was) offered vp for the generall good of the whole Israel of God: like as was the Lambe offred Nom. 28. 23 vp euerye day (morning and euening) and vppon

the Sabaoth double the nomber, and this for the whole Church of God militāt here in the earth. For the time when, I take it to be in a sort Arbitrary, and left to Israels voluntarye contribution. Neither see I any thing to the contrarye, but it might be an offering according to the aforesayd vowes, vnredeemed, and therefore wholye turned vnto ashes, according to that in Psa. 20. where the King offring to the Lord before hee went into the battaile, all the Church of Israell is introduced

The Ceremoniall Lawe (and some ceremonye somtimes, was ioyned with iudicials) that is the

kind of law he meaneth, as may appeare by the Chapter afore-going, whereupon he grounds his Illatiō, as also by that which followeth as an explanation of his meaning. Nor is the shadow ing Lawe, only the ceremoniall victimaes & victuals, but also (as the apostle Paule presseth to the Colossians) Holy dayes, New moones and Sabaoth▪ were a shadow of things to come (for som shadowed things, som good things, but the body or substāce of them was in Christe) Then without all controuersie

and further repetition, these ceremonial Zebachs, slaughters and Gnolahs ascensions by fire, they foretyped or shadowed foorthe some things touching Christ and his mysticall bodye.
               But before I presse the significations of the Ceremoniall sacrifices, let mee obserue, the exceeding careful loue of god towards Israel, touching the matter of sacrifice, shaped forth to the abili ty of the sacrificer: euery one was not able to present a Bullocke, then a Sheep or goate shoulde

suffice. Euery one was not able to prepare a sheep or Goat; then hee was to offer of the Turtle doues or Pigeons, which (as one writeth) were e

And that the Persians well vnderstood, who once a yeere kepte a festiuall daye called The death of vices, what day they practised the killing and destroying of all sortes of Serpentes, vnderstanding by them varietye of vi. ces.
               But as the Lorde would not charge Israel

with Animalls, either hardly or dangerouslye to be acquired: so, by the tamerkind of creatures, he would teach vs more commendable qualifica tions. As all heathen inuentiō for sacrifice must needs be abhominable, because of the lord vncommāded; so, to what an height of sauage im piety was Israell grown vnto, after their schisme from Iudah, who oftentimes stained theyr hāds in their childrens blood offring them vp to the diuel & Moloch.

                  SEcondly, the sacrifices of this Holocaust, were to Sacrifice presented at the dore, &c. be brought-vnto the do
                        •…
                     e of the Tabernacle, wher the Prieste was to receiue the same. In other sacrifices destinated to some particular necessity (as in the 4 Chapter) the Presenter was to

confesse his or theyr sinne, with their hand or handes vppon the head of the Sinne offering. To bring the oblation to the doore, is generallie taken, for presenting our deuotions vnto Christ, who calls himselfe the dore in S. Iohn. 10, 9: The note is profitable, but I knowe not howe proper. To bring it vnto the dore of Con uention, was to bring it vnto the face of the Congregation, that all so might knowe, not onely that he was an Israelite called to the same

Hope in Messiah, but also that so he might send vppe his sacrifice with theirs, euen in the same holy communion. Nor doth the equity thereof, but abide for euer. For besides our priuate deuotions, wee must publiquely also conuene, and so with one hearte and mind praise the father of our Lorde Iesus Christ. For saith the Apostle, If any withdraw himselfe, my soule shall haue no pleasure 
                  Heb. 10. 38. 39. 
                  in him; making (in the next wordes) such withdrawing to bee an argument of perdition, and

opposite vnto faith. As for the confession of sin, it remaineth still, to bee made vnto the hy-priest of our profession, Christ Iesus, but not to any minister necessarilye in the eare, as Romanists wold haue it. For marke, that all heere was done at the doore of Conuention, where other of the people might take notice of the sin, so well as of the sacrifice: for nothing here is once noted to be done in Huggermugger as the lasciuious vndermining Romanistes doe in their Cloisters. It

rather argueth publique confession for publique sinne. The hand laid on the sinne offrings head, intimated theyre faith in Messiahs death for the forgiuenesse of sinn Nor without the hande of faith, is that sacrifice made ours. It is not sufficient sacrifice for sinne but for my sinne, so well as for any other. Wee muste therefore put the hande of our faith vpon Iesus Christe our Heade, and say; Christ came into the worlde to saue sinners, of whome I am chiefe, and yet

one of the poore members, to whome hee is an Head. If thy sinnes were as red as the scarlet-lace (for there-to Nomb. 19

               3. Thirdly, all these sacrifices were to dye, and euen so was Christ. Caiphas coulde say so, It is necessary that one oye for the people. So saith Caiphas of Rome, But

when hee hath so sayde, he hath spoken the thing he vnderstāds not, wherupon his bloudy minded people, sets Barrabbas free, and crucifieth christ Iesus in his members: an heauy case, that christ must die, or wee coulde not liue.
               4. Fourthly, the bloud of all these victimaes, was to be sprinkled vpō 
                  Blood sprinkled. the Altar rounde about: If rounde about besides the Altar, then it argued very plainly, that not only the Altar of Israel was by his bloud (as afore) purged; but also, that the

whole earth (or nations) round about Israell, was by the bloud of Messiah to receiue a purgation, according to that in Re. 7, where after the sealing of Israel, there be an innumerable people of all nations, tongues & languages, that stand before the spirituall throne of Christ, with theyr garmentes made white by the bloud of the Lamb. But howsoeuer any shall vnderstand the Hebrew, the altar did well enough represent the whole spiritual Israel of God possessed of faith (laying

holde on the blood of Iesus, drinking the benefit thereof as verily in theyre hearts, as the hot brazen altar licked vp the blood) vpon whose

ritch. For his members, it teacheth them herein to be conformable vnto Iesus, willing for the work of godlines sake, to be vncased & displumed of all riches, credit, preferment, life, for glorifying of the heauenlye father. So to doe, is to take vp our crosse and follow him: to carry a crosse enforced vppon a man, deserues but an enforced thankes, and recompence.
               But, to take vp a cros voluntarily (whē otherwise we might with false harred christians reuolt and

leaue it) that argues a greater loue to gods glo ry, then to a mans owne worldly welfare.

Not many in our time, speciallye that bee fantastique: and yet the times be not so corrupt, but (God haue the prais) there bee some that will beare it, and maintain it. Onely let mee approue my selfe in a few Quoeres to the wise; for wisedom is iustified of her childrē.
               1 How do they deuide the word arighte, that teache the law vnto iusti fication, & in the wāt of

moral perfectiō, do send people away for brāded reprobates. A more dā

By a necessary consequent, these would bring vs to thinke wee haue horriblye sinned in comming to the Lordes supper, who haue not had their kind of sermon in Baptisme. For it was abhomination to come vnto the Pas-ouer before one was circumcised: we hauing Bapti

to their vnderstanding. If they fumble out the Brownists answer & say, that need not; for as they that came circūcised from Israel vnto Iudah, did only repēt such their circumcision, but not repeat it; euen so in this, I answere they beg the questiō for such Israelites might wel repent their schisme from Iudah, but not repent their circū
                     cision, much lesse the bap tised amongst vs, neede repente baptisme performed in the churches vnitye. If the Sacramente should at first be

a false Sacramente, it could neuer bee made true without actual correction of the faulte; euen as a doctrine at firste false, can neuer be made true, but by actuall alteration. These fantasticks would be put, first to define a sermon, & secondly bee put to searche for such a kind of sermon in the Bible before circum cision and Baptisme, the pas-ouer and Lords supper. But it is sufficient, that they bewitche the notvnderstāding people with such toyes, for procuring a bit of bread and

a handfull of Barley; and yet I feare not in meane time to saye, that it is the Gouernors great sin to suffer it. I am not ignorant, (nay I hold fast) that the best kinde of preaching, is best to bee approued, and as it may regularlye be had, is chiefely to bee desired, according to that of the Apostle, desire the best guifts. But must 1 Cor. 12. 31. it followe therefore, that none but the best, will qualifie a Christian, a Minister, or Sacramente? Fye for shame.
               Then some of these

Sermocinators must be turned out, not onely for no Sacrament makers, but also for no christians A worde so for the vnwise least they seem wise, but no moe words to the vnwise, least they growe arrogant, as deseruing a laboured answer.
               3. How do they cut vp the worde arighte, that teache people (contrary to all the scriptures and approoued leitourgies) not to pray for theyr familiar, godlye, approued Christian brother, that his sins (though he cesire our praiers) may be pardoned

in Christ Iesus, without an I F after this manner, Lorde forgiue to this Brother his sinne? I F it be thy pleasure. Adding this for theyr reason forsoothe, they knowe not by anye Reuelation whether such a one may not be a close hypocrite and a reprobate.
               
                  Monstr' horrena' inform' ingens cui lumen ademptum. Was euer the like vnsaithfull and vncharitable positiō maintayned to the poysoning of ignoraunte hearers? How woulde such a one

pray for these that persecute, when they praie no better for such as blesse? Shewe mee one president in the Bible for such a conceipte. Euery speache contayning an IF, is not prayer: Nor euery petition with an IF, is a prayer for remission of sinne. Nor if such an example coulde bee found, doth it presentlie followe, that it is a doctrine to vs. How shall I pray feruentlye for my brother if I doubte whether God will heare me? How can I pray in Loue for him, if I doubt whether

hee bee indeede a member of Christ? or may belong to Christ? Are not they well helped, that desire such new, fōd, fashioned praiers?
               Our Sauiour dealte otherwise, and so did Saint Stephen, when beeing persecuted vnto the death (were such persecutours like al, of them to bee reuealed for elected ones?) they prayed, that that sinne mighte not bee layde vnto theyr charge; without that adding, if so they

be thine elect. Wee are to walke by the commaundement, Praye for all (excepting for such as haue sinned against the holye Ghost as afore) specially to pray for the prosperity of all such, as wish wel to Ierusalem, that is to the Church. The secret things belōg vnto the lord, but the things reuealed, (& Deu. 29. 29. that is amōg others this to pray for albrethren in saith) they remaine for vs and our children to d

But if it were, but for preuenting of such fantastique formes of prayer, I maruail not, though the Churches gouernors impose a set form of publike prayers. Are such like to diuide the worde arighte, that knowe not yet howe to pray in faith and Charity? with as good reason, they might debar people the sacraments, saying, that they belōg only to the faithfull, & what know they but that they

may be hypocrites.
               4 Fourthly, howe doe they cut vp the worde of God aright; that make, things of Indifferent na ture so essentiall in religion, as the admittance of them destroye the sa cramentes, discipline, word, and Church?

               5 Fiftly, how do they cut and apply the word aright, that hauing pastorall places doe delite publikely to shame their owne people particularly and personaly, before all strangers, with bitter derisions and girdinges; and that before any priuate dealing with them in loue and meetnesse of spirite; as if with the horn they wold push thē out of the sold, rather then trauail, bow & bende with our sauiour, for getting the loste

sheepe home againe to the fold. Such as these woulde feele discipline, before they be permitted to teach disciplin.
               6. Sixtly, how do they cut vp the text arighte, that hauing once read it, do let it fall as an hot irō, not daring once after to touch it. These (forsooth) would not be called bare reders (much lesse domb-dogs) and therefore they must vndergo to preach, though they cannot tell what. And yet if they can declamita

               Section. 14.
               
                  THere bee some thinges in the burnt offerings, that stand peculiar and Sacrifices peculiars. proper to their owne kind: as first, in the beasts it was required, that only Males were offred: so is it not necessarilye required in the Birds. Secondly, the fat of the beasts was to be seuered from the inwards, so not in the birds. Thirdly, the Beasts were to bee diuided asunder, so not the

Birds. Fourthly, the whole of the Beasts was to be offred & receaued, but the maw & feathers of the Birds were to be cast on the Eastside of the Altar amongst the a shes, that were to bee swept vp & caried away out of the Tabernacle: of all these in order, as God shall enable me.
               1. First, that Males of the Beasts were required; & males beeing naturallye more sufficiēt & strong, they best serued for expressing the sufficiēcy of Iesus for becōming an al sufficiēt sacrifice both for

fying his father, & streng thning of his members. Touching vs, it taught (as Malachi teacheth) that the best things are Mal. 1. 14. to be giuen vnto God, & that vnder the paine of 
                     〈◊〉
                   curse. In the birdes, this seemed to bee dispensed with, the reason I knowe not.
               2. Secondly, the birds not being diuided asunder, did doubtles teache som vnity in the parts of our deuotion, and fellowships. But why also the same was not admitted in the Beastes, I yet conceiue not.
               
                  
3. Thirdly, that the far of all inwards shoulde bee offered vpp to the Lord (for neither that inward fat, nor bloud might bee eaten in any houshold of Israel) I doubt not it intended, both in Christ Leuit. 3. 16. 17. for merit, and in vs for conformitye, an offering vp to the father of heauen, the very best cogitations within vs. But why in the beastes seuered, & the other not enioy

               4 Fourthly, why nothing in the Beastes, but somwhat in the birds should

bee reiected, I neither know: but what may bee meant by the reiectiō of feathers & maw, I doubt not to speak probably & with consonāce of faith. The mawe and feathers being expulsed the Sacrifice & so consequently, of dislike vnto GOD, they must necessarily intend euill reiected of Christ, and to be cast aside of vs. What is more light then a feather? and what more light then vnity of mind? Christ taking our nature, did that without assuming our vanity. The substance he

O good God, if this be true (and too true it is) in what a miserye are churches ordinarilie in? One pickes vp euill

opinions from hereticks and schismaticks, and all too readily do swallowe down the corrupt examples of the times; whereby people do make Ieru salem a mawe (I coulde wish that our Ierusalem were not for that, vnder the hand of a continuing pestilence) and by such collection of euill humors, they fill the bodye of the common wealth with Apostems.

sweet Iesus, so was thou yoked for our sinnes; who before thou vnderwente our nature, neuer caryed yoke, for thou could not, because thou then was only god blessed for euer. But vnto the God-heade vniting our manhood, how was thou drawn before the Hy-priest, howe was thou bound, twitched, smitten, hanged vp & pierced, and all for our sinne! Ieremy saith, that it is good for a man to beare 
                  Ier. Lament. 3. 27. 
                  the yoke in his youth, and shall we bee impatient to beare, as thou hast borne before vs? Dauid coulde

saye, that it was good for him that he had been afflicted: and cannot wee finde like good in our afflictions, yea in the afflictions of our youth? Timely crookes the Tree, that good crammocke will bee; and will wee not at firste bowe downe, take vp Christs yoke and followe him? Hee was the Bullocke, which was slaughtered for the Prodigall, euen for the repenting Gentile, when the Elder Brother Israell stoode without. Well through vnbeliefe they are

For Iesus him self, who could exact more simplicity, thē hee wittingly & willingly performed? Know ing that his time of deth drewe neere, as also that the traitoure was gone out to deliuer him into the bloodsuckers hāds, hee wente into his accustomed

garden for prayer, familiarly known vnto Iudas the traytor. Hee there beeing met withall, and asked if hee were the man they soughte for, without all equiuocation hee tells them. Hauing smit them downe with his word, hee would not flye, but did as if hee shoulde saye, Loe, I come to doe thy will O God. The varlets hayling him vp and down from post to piller, from one place to an other (and the miles hee trauailed that nighte, were more

then inow) they despitefullye mocking him, spawling in his face and deriding him, did neuer once returne an harshe word. After diuers questions, hee answering them mildely, but they nothing bettered thereby (good Lorde, what maruell then if we speak without speeding?) hee then beeing againe asked againe the same thinges, was more mute then the shaddowinge Lambe before his shearer.
               For his fleece, he was willing not onely to laye

aside (after a sorte) the manifestacion of his glorious power; but also, to bee fleeced of his cloathes (euen of his seamelesse Coate) to the baring of his body vnto the Crosse. And shall his simplicitye not teache vs simplicitye, euen the simplicitye of the Doue?

               The third Animall destined heere for sacrifice, The Goate sacrificed, propter similitudinem carnis peccati: Beda in Leuit. 1. is the Goate. The Sheepe aforesayde not more harmelesse, then this harmefull. In which respecte, the Prophet Ezechiel in Chapter 34: 17 &c: putteth a difference between the sheep on the one side, and the sturdye Rammes and Goates on the other side, speaking thus; Also you my Sheepe, thus saith the Lord God, behold I iudge between sheep & sheep

between the Rams and the Goats. Seemeth it a small thing vnto you, to haue eaten vp the good pasture, but ye must treade downe with your feet the residue of your pasture, and to haue drunk of the deep waters, but ye must trouble the residue with your feet? And my sheepe eate that which ye haue troden with your feet, & drink that which ye haue troubled with your feet: &c Of proude mounting minds be the Goats, and yet no creature more rā

How coms the Goat then, ceremonially to shaddowe out Christ, who is the end of the lawe? Of him it is testified, that he was in all things like vnto vs, Sin only excepted: verve true. Neither did the Goat shadow him forth,

in respecte of any sinne in him, but for sin vpon him: So that he mighte well say, as in Amos. Beholde I am pressed vnder you, as a cart is pressed, that is full of sheaues. Not a cart-load, but a worlds load of sinne was vpon him, whereby in our nature he became the Lotgoat in Leuitticus, 16. while in the other nature hee withdrewe (in respect of manifestation) vnto Gnarazel a place inhabitable for sinners. Heereupon let me lay down the speech of an ancient greeke father.

               Sweet Iesus, what discōfortable burden didst thou beare for mankind, that indeed might fully bee represented by the goat; who haue not only

the sin of others vpō vs (as negligentmaiestrats, ministers, masters, Parents, haue the sinnes of their vngouerned & vntaught people vpon thē: and the intifers to sinne, haue the sins of the intised vpon them) but also the Goat fitly and fullie resembled vs for sin also within vs: so that, neither outside nor inside is free from desert of iudgmēt. O Lorde, how shall wee stand in thy presence? Giue vs faith in thee, wherby thou maist couer our iniquities, as Esaus garment couered Iacob,
                  
wherby he got the blessing. I beleeue, lord help my vnbeliefe. And howsoeuer I can neuer purge my selfe, as I may merite the least of thy fauours; yet I beseeche thee giue mee grace to labour the clearinge of heart and hand, in way of thankefulnesse and conformity; that so dying to sinne, as thou dyed for sin, I may in my conuersation, glorifie the father that is in heauen: Amen.

                  THe Birdes appointed for Holocaust in this Turtles sacrificed. first of Leuiticus are first the Turtles, and secondlye the Pigeons. The phrase in the Text, Let thy oblation bee Of the Turtles, or of yong Pigeons, compared with the sacrifice of purificatiō, in Leu. 12. 8. (where a lamb being offred, then 1 Turtle or Pigeō wold serue: but otherwise, a payre

What greater faithfulnes can there be, thē that wherwith christ hath loued his Church? So dear hath his spouses bin vnto him, as for washing her from the Leaprosie of sin, he hath wil linglye powred forth his best bloud. The Pelicane

Sacrifices vse, did breath pant, and fainte downewards. The poore Turtle respecteth onelye her mate, and why shold we spiritually wed our heart to any but to thee? It was

the sinne of Israell to go a whoringe after other louers (false Gods and false worships:) sweet Iesus keepe vs vnto thee in the vnitie of truth and bonds of peace. To thee wee gaue out faith in Baptisme (not to Moses nor his law-for that way shall no flesh bee iustified in thy sighte) giue vs therefore allwayes, specially when satan would assaile vs with desperation, to looke directly vnto thee, who saiest, Beleiue and liue, not worke and liue. By thy Prophet thou thus saiest, They say

But thou (speaking to the Church) haste plaied the Harlot with many louers, Yet turne againe to mee, saith the Lord.

The multitude of them are compared to acloud (as bee all the faithfull in Hebr. 11. tearmed in Hebr: 121, a Clowd of witnesses) & their comming vnto the church is by flocks, as doues to their culuer howse, and as thousands rowled in togither, at Saint Peters Sermons, Christs doue

is but one, as shee is considered a bodye to him, her Head; but the members of that on catholique body, be many We are inioyned in, S. Mathew the 10. Ch. to be innocent or simple as Doues. Of innocency and simplicitie. I haue spoken in the sheep, nor need I heer to inculcate that. Naturians haue noted that they be void of gall, teaching vs to bee void of bittern: but sure I am, that howsoeuer they lack a bag of gal: yet there is that matter in thē, howsoever sparsed,

may appeare by theire prettie kind of pettishnes. Arguing that howsoeuer we should not retaine a bag of gall in vs (as Simō Magus did to the causing of a root of bitternes to grow vp) yet we are to retain an holy anger in vs against sin; ac cording to that aduise of the Apostle vnto the Ephesians, bee angry but sin not.

               Section. 17.
               
                  FOr an end to the whole: first, why did God incommend so many sortes of sacrifice to the church? Principally for these respects: once to lead people (as by the Eye and hand) to the manifolde sinnes they ron into: that hauing the Sight & Sense of them, they might bee forced to fly from themselues and any their best

works, to the one onely sufficient sacrifice, christ Iesus crucified. As also, by the variety of commendable qualities in the sacrifices, to consider the superexcelent mach les graces in Iesus, wherto euery Christiā member, shoulde striue to conform it selfe: for that is a conformity of conformities, aliened from the world.
               2. Secondly, it may then bee demaunded, wherefore these sacrifices were not continued, though not to signifie Christ to come, yet to signifie the

same thinges in Christ passed? I answer: one mayn reason why god so abolished them, might be for the good of Israel euen for their readyer comming to Christ. For if now after the abolishment, they are ready to follow them with daungerous stumblings, how then wold they haue rushed vppon them, if so they still had stood in their way. A fore-resemblance hereof, might be that burial of Moses by Iehouah 
                  Deut. the last chapter. in an vnknowne place; that so with more readinesse they might

followe Ioshua (or Iesus) Heb. 4. 8. his successour (for both the names be one: the first Hebrew, the second Greek, in English Sauior) who had they known his sepulcre, no doubte, they would not onelye haue idolatrizd before it, as the Romanists doe vpon slenderer respects, but also had bin likely to haue builded some habitations nere to him, and haue put Ioshuah to haue iourneyed to Canaan alone: Because they shold not rest on Moses, but follow Ioshuah, the Lord conueyd his body away,

notwithstāding that Satan (as Saint Iude noteth) stroue for the contrary. And euen so likewise, he hath remoued the bodie of Moses his ceremonies, to the end that they and all, may more readily repaire to Iesus. For Iesus & not Moses must bring the people vnto heauens Rest, better then Canaan the figure: Secondly, the comming of Christ Iesus, was the great grace of this world and therefore proportionably to bee exhibited with fewer ceremonies and lesse chargeable. In

which respect, Baptisme came in place of all washings and purifications by water and bloud: and the Lords supper substituting the meat offrings, drinke offrings and the fleshofferings accompanying the same. Both these ceremonies right easie, and effectually and familiarly pointing out all the former excellencies in Iesus, the end of all ceremonies.

in their & our ceremonies, Christ be receiued in one and the same mā
                  ner of them and vs. I answer, they sawe him to come by faith, and we by faith see that he is passed by. Their faith did not re ceiue him carnallye, nor doth ours: they beleiued that so verily as their bodies were partakers of the sacramental signs, so their souls shold partake of christ & his graces sig nified therby: if any shold haue taught an Israelit or Iew, that after the Priest had consecrated in the meatoffring, meale, oyle, &c. as after his cōsecratiō
                  
of the victimaes, that all these beasts, birds, meal, oyle, eares of corn, frankinsence, wine, that all or anye of them had bin turned into the Real carnal nature of Messiah and that so they had eaten Christ fleshly, doubt lesse they woulde haue stoned such a one to death, as teaching but a Bellygod and a Beastlye Christ. But the Romanistes (the vpholders of the winegod & breaden God) they will say, that howsoeuer the auncient church did not in theyr oblations receiue the

verye flesh and bloud of Christ (for as then hee had not put our nature vppon him, howsoeuer som say, he did in certain appearances, sed mihi qui dem opinio dura) yet the greater Grace exhibited vnto the new Church, dooth necessarily bring such reall eating of him, with it. I answer, the grace is more excellēt & diuine to feed on him by faith, thē to eate him really with teethe. And if the Church in any age, shold haue eaten Christ so grosly, thē it doubtles had bin commended, to

the ancient church, who in her nōage was inform Hebr. 9. 10. ed (as the apostl speketh) with carnal rites. Besides, how coms it about then, that they dare not saye, that the water in baptim is also turned into his reall blood, for cleansing of our soules? Besides, if Iudas Iscariot & vnbelieuers do eat Christs ve ry flesh in the Sacramēt (for so they teach, & sure their teeth are as able as others) how coms it they cā be dāned; except these Idolaters will basphemously also say, that som of Christs real nature & holy body is also damned

with them. Proh nefandum scelus, their doctrine is like their vaulte gunpowder practises, & their giuing the sacramēt for obliging people vnto massacres, & treasons matchlesse, argues them bolder in euil, then the Diuell himselfe vnmasked durst be. If they shall say (and what dare they not say) that the anciēt christiā doctors wer of their mind: I answer: tis fouly vntrue: shew me that euer so much as once any of them bound any person by the sacraments receiuing, to attempt any murther: If

they say, they were of their mind touching the reall eating of Christes flesh in the newe testament. I answer: first it fol loweth not that wee shold beleeue any thing which any of them shall teach opposit vnto scrip ture: for the Apostle commands vs in such a case, to hold an angell accursed. Secondly, it appeareth flat otherwise as many our learned mē haue proued; which rests vpon them neuer to be truely answered. A few such testimonies I will adde.

With infinite the like. And indeede, the Patriarchs, and we should not be sa ued by on and the same faith (but they by one faith and wee by another) if wee shoulde bee saued alone by eating his reall-flesh, and they without. The Auncientes many times extolled

                  The thing signified so hie, as they almoste forgot the Signe: but that was not, for that they held the Sign to be turned into the thing signified; but because they laboured to bring theire hearers from sticking superstitiously in the sign, vnto the grace signified thereby; yea, exhibited therwith vnto the faithfull communicant. But leauing the Romanists to their Gods of bread, their gods of wine, and their Gods and goddesses of wood, stone, gold, siluer, tin, lead, wax: let

vs hold that position of Augustin, who speaking of the old & new Sacramēts, saith, They be diuers in their signes, but in the

               4. A fourth question may be this: whither all such as inioyne and vndergoe any externall ceremonies (specially, significatiue) as in the Bible, be not of God directlye and expresly enioyned; whither all such people commaunding bee not limmes of Antichrist, and the vndergoers bearers of the badge of Antichrist? I answer. Antichristianisme

consistes not in things commāded besides expres scripture (for then the festiuals appoin ted by Mordecai & Iudas Maccabaeus, the rearing vp of Synagogues & synagogicall orders, the rearing vp of schooles of prophecie with their orders, the rough garment of the vn-Leuitical prophets, with many things in the temple not expres ly commanded, shold be Antichristiā) but the cō
                  manding & vndergoing of things opposite or against the scripture. The coūsel the apost. gaue the

Corinths in chap. 7. hee saith of it, that he had it not commaunded from the Lord: and therefore besides scripture, but not against Scripture: for had it beene against the lordes worde, it had been but the counsail of Satan. To command anie order, ceremony or act

                  : And to haue any ceremony in the Church, though not against scrip ture, yet, absolutelye dumbe and vnsignificatiue, is so farre from being the better, as it is rather

ridiculous and fana tique. God teacheth vs by the heauens, by the earth, by the feas and theire continents, and makes them all significatoures of spirituall thinges, and shal churches-ceremonies bee a together domb? There is a difference betweene a Signe exhibi

Paul, & S. Iohns sense, consisteth not (which to few haue marked) either in an Antithesis or opposition vn to christs external order or yet in an opposition to the Iudicial or moral law. Euē such oppositiōs

are hainus & wicked, but do not therefore cōclude Antichristianism; al euil euen in the members of christ, is condēnable, but they not therfore Antichristiā, nor it antichri stianisme. Antichristianity in the newe testaments sence, is an opposition to the newe couenant of Grace, called of the apostle another gospel: 
                  Galat, 1. 6. 7. that is, glad tydings in som other then in christ. And such were they that went out, wherof S. Iohn speaketh, seking iustifica tion by another meanes then christ, as by the obseruatiō of the moral law

or the law of Ceremonies, or the like. This

                  onger captiued of them. 5. The last question may be this, when shal ceremonies altogither end? I answer: whē the world is cōsumed, & the heauens & earth analysed: or more plainly, ceremonies shal cease, when Faith ceaseth. Faith ceaseth, when wee

haue fully got the thing we faithed or beleeued: for ceremonies bee but as a waggon for conuaiing faith to his iournies end. Faith beeing the apprehension of things vnseene (for I speake of the most excellent kind of faith) when once they and wee come togither into full possession (and that is not, till wee attaine heauens glory) then Faith stinteth. Being come to the period or ful point, it can reach no further, nor hope that held the thing beleued and hoped for. And

in this respect it is, that Charitie in the 1. Cor. 13. is preferred before hope & faith: they then ceasing, but loue towards god and our fellow members, continuing for euer. And for such continuāce eternall, it is also, that God (neuer cal led by name of faith, or Hope) is called of saint Iohn by the name of Loue or Charitie.
               O God of Abrahā, Isaac & Iaakob, a god of the liuing, that liue vnto thee eternally: but more speci ally ô thou the father of our Lord Iesus Christ,

whome in respect of Adams fall, thou didst appoint to be a new and a liuing a way for iustification and saluation, vnto all such as shoulde come vnto thee by him. Heauenly father, wee haue broken thy Lawe actually in our selues, so well as originally in our fore-patents, and therefore haue deserued, that all the curses of the Law should fall vppon vs: so far bee wee from beeing able to bee iustified by doing the workes of the Law; And therefore flying from all hope of

health by that old Law, Do and liue, we come vnto thee by the newe and liuing way, Beleeue and liue eternally. We belieue ô Lord helpe our vnbeliefe. Increase our faith for apprehension of all the promises, sealed vpp in Christ with Yea and Amen: for they be all true, and hee the waye, trueth, and life. Keepe vs in this wildernesseworlde, with our backes vpon slauish sinful AE—gypt, wherein too long we serued Sathan worse then Pharaoh: and giue vs to keepe our face still

towardes heauens Rest (better thē Canaās rest) vntil we attain that new land wherein shall dwel only righteousnes. And in falling in this worlde (vouchsafe as thou didst to Moses) to giue vs sighte from aboue, for discerning seuerall lots and inheritaunces in that rest: for if there were not seuerall mansions (ô Father) in thy house, thy Sonne would otherwise haue tolde vs, but loe hee is gone before to prepare a place for his people. Giue vs grace to see; and in seeing,

giue vs to exulte in thee, with care of becomming more conformeable vnto thee. To that end, blesse the Ministrye of thy Sonnes Gospell vnto vs, that so his loue may constrayne vs tó loue the dooing of all his commaundementes. Blesse Gouernours and Gouerned, High and lowe, ritche and poore, with a divine care to doe, not onelye the holye and righteous duties that appertaine to them as they be christians, but also, as they be christiās of such

and such places; that so thy name may bee more generally bonored amongest vs; and in thy sauing mercies sealed vp in Christe Iesus, this greeuous pestilence maye bee farre remooued from vs. Heare vs for the sake of thy sonne our sole Sauiour, whom in worde and sacrementes thou hast exhibited mercifullye vnto vs. To whome, with thee and the blessed spirit, three distinct persons, but one true and euerliuing GOD, bee all kingdome, power
