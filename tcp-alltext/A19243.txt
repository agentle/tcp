            TO THE MOST REVEREND FATHER IN GOD, TOBIAS, MY LORD Archb. of Yorke his Grace, Primate and Metropolitan of England.
            
               IT is lamentable to conſider how many ſtarres are fallen of late from heauen, how manie Goddeſſes on the earth haue departed from the faith, and giuen heed vnto the ſpirit of errors, and doctrines of ſlanderers, to wit, the Papiſts. Yet me thinkes it is no matter of wonderment, becauſe we reade, That if men receiue not the loue of the truth,

               that they might be ſaued, God in his iuſtice will giue them ſtrong deluſions to beleeue lies, that they may be damned: for few, or none, of theſe late Apoſtataes, for any thing I can learne, were euer in loue with the truth. Among vs they were, but they were not of vs, as now appeares
 by their departing from vs; for if they had bene of vs, they would haue continued with vs; doubtleſſe they would neuer haue falne to Poperie. For though Poperie be managed after the moſt politicke manner, yet in it ſelfe it is a groſſe Religion: and the Perfiters thereof, as ſhameleſſe men in auowing manifeſt vntruths, and denying knowne truths, as euer ſet pen to paper. All which it is as eaſie to proue, as to obiect, againſt them. But my purpoſe at this time is, to lay open their ſhame in denying knowne truths: which though it may be ſhewed by diuers particulars, as namely byN.

                   ghius, &c generall denying that Pope Honorius the firſt was an hereticke, and by ſuch like: yet moſt apparently their impudehcy appeares in denying the report of Pope Ioane, which is proued by a cloude of witneſſes in this diſcourſe (which I make bold to preſent vnto your Grace:) for they are driuen to feigne, to forge, to cogge, to play the fooles, and in plaine Engliſh, to lie all manner of lies,
 for the couering of their ſhame in this. Onuphrius, Harding, Saunders, Cope, Genebrard, Bellarmine, Bernartius, Florimondus, Papyrius Maſo, Baronius, Parſons, and diuers others, who haue ioyned hand in hand, with purpoſe to carrie this cauſe away by ſtrong hand; are ſo intangled in it, that it is with them, as with birds in the lime twigs, which ſticke the faſter in, by how much they flutter the more to get out. VVhich if your Grace vpon peruſing (at your beſt leiſure) ſhall find true, my humble deſire is, that you will giue me leaue to publiſh it vnder your Graces name: partly, that by it the ſimpler ſort (for I write not for the learned) may haue a taſt by this of the honeſty, or rather the diſhoneſty of Papiſts in hādling of points in controuerſie: and partly, that it may be a teſtimonie of that reuerent reſpect, which I acknowledge due to ſuch Church-Gouernours as your Grace is, who giue attendance vnto reading, which the1. Tim. 4. 13. Apoſtle willed Timothy to do: and after the example of the ancient Biſhops, preach often: drawing on others, not by words onely, but by example alſo, to performance of like exerciſes. Hereafter, if it pleaſe God, that health, and
 meanes of bookes ſerue, I ſhall light on ſome more profitable argumēt. In the meane while, I pray God ſtrengthen your Graces hands to the finiſhing of the Lords worke, in the Prouince wherein you ſit, as one of the ſeuen Angels in the ſeuen Churches mentioned in the Reuelation: that by your Graces meanes, the Epha, wherein Popiſh wickedneſſe ſitteth, may be lift vp betweene the earth and the heauen, and caried out of the North, into the land of Sinar, and ſet there vpon his owne place.

The reaſon why I haue framed it in way of Dialogue, was, that I might meete more fully with all the cauils which thy Proctors vſe in pleading of this caſe: and that it might be better vnderſtood of cōmon Readers, who are ſooner gulled with continued diſcourſes. If I haue ſpoken truly, I would haue thee beare witnes with me vnto the truth; if otherwiſe, I am cōeent thou ſtrike me.

               PAP.
               I ſay, the very truth is, that the whole ſtorie of Pope Ioane, isOnuph. Annot. in Plat. in vita Ioh. 8. a fable; aHarding in his anſwer to Iuels Apology. fond and vaine fable, aN. D. part. 2. c. 5. Nu. 21. pag. 391. of the 3. Conuerſ. meere fable, an

YeaIdem. Nu. 36. pag. 403. I ſay further, there are ſo many improbabilities, and morall impoſſibilities in this tale, as no man of any meane iudgement, diſcretion, or common ſenſe, will giue credite thereto: but will eaſily ſee the vanitie thereof. And in a word,Impudentiſſimè ficta, ſtul. tiſſimè credita Bernartius de vtilitate legendae hiſt. lib. 2. p. 105. in marg.

               Now this is excellent in good truth: I ſee there is mettall in you. But what reaſon haue you on your ſide, that you are ſo peremptorie? Did it not run for currant without controlment till within theſe fortie yeares, or thereabout: to wit, till the year 1566, that Onuphrius the Frier began to bogle at it? Was not Onuphrius the firſt, that euer by reaſon ſought to diſcredit the report of it?

Yea do we not find it in ſome of your ſtories ſet downe in pictures? And is not ſo much to be gathered by that image of hers, which is ſet vp amongſt the reſt of the images of the Popes in the renowned church of Siena in Italie, and is to be ſeene there at this day: which the Biſhop of that place would not ſuffer to be defaced at the laſt repairing of that Church, though your Ieſuites did earneſtly requeſt him to deface it? Was there not made of old
(for feare of ſuch like after-claps) a ſtoole of eaſement, on which they were ſet at their creation, for proofe of their humanitie? Was there not a marble image ſet vp as a monumēt thereof in that place where ſhe miſcaried? to wit, in one of the chiefeſt ſtreets in Rome? which monument was to be ſeene likewiſe within theſe few yeares, euen in Pius the 5. his time. And is it not written by men among your ſelues, that your Popes, when they go in proceſſion, refuſe to go through that ſtreete, in deteſtation of that fact, and go further about? How ſay you, is it not euen thus?

               It is written (IPhilip. Bergom. in Supplem. chron. lib. 11. ad a

For the true reaſon why they turne out of that ſtreet, which is the nearer way, is, for that, that ſtreete is anguſta & anfractuoſa, a narrow ſtreete, and ſuch a one as windes this way and that way: and in that reſpect, vnfit for ſo great atraine, as ordinarily accompanies the Pope to paſſe orderly through: as

For if vpon their leauing that ſtreete, they enter into by-lanes and by-ſtreets, and as ſoone as they are paſt that ominous place turne in againe; the reaſon why they leaue that ſtreete cannot be, for that it is narrow, and winding in and out. For no queſtion, but thoſe by-lanes, are as narrow: and by their turning out, and returning into the ſame way againe, they winde as often in and out, as if they went along through the ſame ſtreete, though it were very crooked. But howſoeuer, ſhift it among you: for it ſufficeth me, that you cannot deny, but that which I told you concerning this point, is written by men of your owne religion: eſpecially ſeeingDe vitis pont. in vita Ioh. 8.

               I maruell if that be ſo. But yet I reſt perſwaded vpon Florimondus next reaſon, that that Image reſembled not Pope Ioane. For if the ingrauer had purpoſed to expreſſe ſuch a matter, and to continue thereby the memory thereof to the worlds end, he would haue ſet ſomeInſcriptionem praefixiſſet. pag. 188. inſcription ouer it; for ſo do all men who erect monuments for remembrances.

               That is not ſo, for we reade inLib. 7. hiſt. cap. 14. 
                  Euſebius, that the
Mat. 9. 21. woman who was cured by our Sauiour Chriſt of her iſſue of blood, &c. erected (after the cuſtome of the heathen) an image of him, no doubt for remēbrance ſake. But we reade of no inſcription written vpon it. In the booke ofCap. 4. 7. 8. 
                  Ioſua we reade, that the Iſraelites were commanded to lay 12. ſtones vpon an heape, as a memoriall vnto their children for euer. And yet it is plaine by the circumſtances they ſet nothing thereon in writing. When you paint S. Peter, you paint him
 with keyes in his hand, and ſet no inſcription ouer his head, nor vnder his feet, asObſerat. in Annal. tom. 1 ad an. 57. apud Poſſeuin. in Apparat ſac. verbo. Caeſar Baron.

That is, For auoiding like error in future times, it was decreed: that no man ſhould be held for Pope, till the yongeſt Cardinall Deacon had found by triall, while he ſate vpon a ſtoole of eaſement, that he was a man. which is likewiſe teſtified byDe rebus Turcicis, l. 6. pag 98. 
                  Laonicus Chalchondylas. For vpon relation of that ſtorie, he goes on thus: Quapropter ne decipiantur iterum, ſed rem cognoſcant, neque ambigant: Pontificis creati virilia tangunt, & qui tangit, acclamat: Mas nobis Dominus eſt: that is, Leſt they ſhould be deceiued againe, they make proofe by feeling; and he that feeleth makes it knowne by crying out; We haue a man Pope. And you may find as much in a later Papiſt, who within theſe few yeares, writ a booke of the Harmonie of Romiſh magiſtrates, and in it this.

That is, There is to be ſeene at this day in the Popes pallace, a chaire of marble, wherein the new Pope preſently vpon his election is ſet downe, that as he ſits, the loweſt Deacon may make triall of his humanitie by touching.

And ſo in time to come, when all euidences are imbezeled, and all monuments defaced, and made out of the way, it will be a plaine caſe there was neuer any Pope Ioane.

For we find the Trinity painted by you, ſomtimes in the likenes of a man with three faces: ſometimes in the likeneſſe of a man, with two heads, hauing a doue between thē; both which faſhions of painting the Trinitie, are monſtrous inLib. 2. de Imag. cap 8.

                  Florimondus confeſſeth the tale is in Mantuan. But Mantuan deſerues no credit in this: for he writes worſe of her then euer any did before him: andStabuli pōtificij praefectum eum illa, laqueo in collum inſerto ſuſpenſum, commentatur. Flor

                  Mantuan talkes of no horſekeeper of hers, but in generall of one who committed adultery with her, nor of any hanging, ſaue of their hanging in hell, which is likely enough to be true. Your Florimondus can lay his finger vpon nothing, but he grimes it. He can comment vpon no mans words, but he wreſts them. There is not a word in Mantuan more (concerning her) then that which is comprehended in the three verſes cited.

That is: Iohn the ſeuenth, by countrey Engliſh, was created Pope next after Leo, and ſate two yeares and fiue moneths. They ſay this was a woman, and that ſhe went verie yong out of England to Athens with a certaine great clerke who was in loue with her: and that there by hearing of good profeſſors, ſhe profited ſo much, that when ſhe came to Rome ſhe had few like her in Diuinitie. Whereupon, by her reading, diſputing, teaching, and praying, ſhe got her ſelfe ſo much fauour, that vpon Leo his death ſhe was choſen Pope into his roome (as manie men ſay) by common conſent. But ſee the lucke of it; a while after ſhe was got with child by one of her acquaintance, and deliuered thereof in the time of her Papacie. For going vpon a time from the Vatican to S. Iohn Laterans in proceſſion, betweene the Coloſſes and S. Clements, ere euer ſhe was aware, ſhe fell in trauell, and was deliuered in the high ſtreete without the helpe of anie midwife. But ſhe died preſently, and was buried without anie ſolemnitie
 in the ſame place, with her litle one by her. Now in hatred of her filthie dealing, and for continuing of the memorie of ſo leud a part, the Popes to this day when they go in proceſſion, in reſpect of their diſlike of that place of her trauell, which was in the midſt of her way, forſaking it, do turne into by-lanes and by-ſtreets, till they haue left that on their backes; and then returning into the ſame ſtreete againe, they go forward with their proceſſion. And for auoiding of like miſchiefe in time to come, it was decreed: That none ſhould be conſecrated Pope, before the yongeſt Cardinall Deacon had tried by touching (whileſt the partie to be conſecrated ſate on a cloſe ſtoole) that he was a man. Thus Bergomenſis.

               Yes marrie did he. But I wonder not at him, for relating of it: becauſe in the ſame place (asLib. citato cap. 7 pag. 64 & 65. 
                  Florimondus obſerues) he writes, that in as much as ſhe was a Germaine, no Germaine could euer ſince be choſen Pope. Which is a lie with a latchet. For diuers Germaines ſince that haue bene aduanced vnto the Popedome, as Damaſus the ſecond, and Victor the ſecond, with others,
            
            
               PRO.
               True: diuers Germaines haue bene Popes ſince Ioane the womans Popedome; and if Wernerus writ the contrary, Wernerus lied ſhamefully. But he hath no rule of his tonge, who chargeth Wernerus with ſuch a matter. For theſe are Wernerus words, which follow preſently vpon the former: Nugantur aliqui, hac de cauſa nullum Almannum in Papam eligi, quod falſum eſſe conſtat. Some prattle, that for this cauſe no Germain may be choſen Pope, which is apparantly falſe. Whereby you may ſee that he reproueth that in others, for which he is iniuriouſly reproued by your Florimondus. Your Florimondus may be a man in office, but if he go on as he begins, he will hardly proue himſelfe honeſt.

Viz. 1480. yeare it was printed, the other without date, but very ancient. And theſe two (as he ſaith) do differ in reporting the ſtorie of Pope Ioane, and in nothing elſe. Now it may be that though in yours it be as you ſay, yet in his it is otherwiſe.
            
            
               PROT.
               I my ſelfe haue ſeene two editions of Wernerus
                   aſwell as Florimondus; yea I haue ſeene foure; oneBy Henry Quentel. printed in the yeare 1479. another printed by Nicolas Gotz of Selteſtad, I know not when, for it caries no date: a third without note either of the printer, or of the place where it was printed, or of the time when it was printed. But queſtionles very ancient: a fourth printed at Frankeford, 1584. In the 3 ancient ones there is not a word different in the narration of Pope Ioane: nor in the 4, ſauing that the words Nugantur aliqui, &c. are in the fourth, and not in the other. But in none of them is there anie ſuch thing as Florimondus chargeth him with. But wil you heare what the next man ſaith to the point in queſtion? He is Matheus Palmerius,

For he diſſembled his ſexe, being a woman indeed: and whē ſhe was verie yong, ſhe went to Athens with a ſcholer, who was in loue with her. Where by hearing good Readers of all good learning, ſhe profited ſo well, that when ſhe came to Rome, ſhe had few fellowes, but neuer a one her better. Now by reading, and diſputing, learnedly and wittily, ſhe got ſo much credite, that vpon Leo his death ſhe was choſen in his roome (as Martin writes) by common conſent. But within a while after ſhe proued with child by one of her ſeruants; & though ſhe caried all cloſely for a time, yet at length as ſhe went to S. Iohn Laterans, betweene the Theater (called the Coloſſes) and S. Clements, ſhe fell in trauell, and was deliuered of a child, and died in the place.

               That Deane had the lucke of it, if he light on ſuch ancient manuſcripts, as the Alderman of Louaine told Bernartius of. But how chanced it, that neither Onuphrius, nor Bellarmine, nor Baronius, who haue had as free acceſſe into the Vatican librarie as anie, could neuer light on theſe manuſcripts? How chanceth it, that none ſince Bernartius thought good to except in that ſort againſt Platina? Onuphrius, Bellarmine, and Baronius acknowledgement, that this ſtorie is in Platina, perſwades me, that either Bernartius belyed
 the Alderman, or the Alderman belyed the Deane, or the Deane made a foole of the Alderman. For queſtionleſſe if there had bene any ſuch manuſcripts, ſome of them would haue found them out, and made it knowne to the world ere this. For they are glad of narrower fig-tree leaues to couer their nakedneſſe withall, then ſuch manuſcripts, if they were forth-coming. But perhaps you haue ſome better anſwer behind then this.

For Paul the ſecond (as all men know) racked him, and depriued him of all his dignities, and iuſtly caſt him into priſon, and kept him there as long as himſelfe liued.

               That Paul the ſecond racked Platina, and depriued him of his dignities, and kept him long in priſon, is verie true. But that he caſt him iuſtly into priſon, is falſe. ForDe ſcript. Eccleſiaſticis. verbo, Bartholomaeus Platina. 
                  Trithemius witneſſeth, that Paul the ſecond dealtCrudeliſſimè. cruelly therein. Yet ſuppoſe all to be true: doth it follow in your Florimondus logick, Paul the ſecond wronged Platina, Ergo Platina hated all Popes? And why not thē: Sixtus the fourth gratified Platina many waies: Sixtus the fourth ſet Platina at libertie, and reſtored him to his dignities: Ergo Platina loued
 all Popes? If one mans kindnes could not work loue towards all: it is not likely that one mans vnkindneſſe ſhould breed an heart-burning againſt all: wherefore, notwithſtanding this, we may wel think that Platina wrote as he thought. And the rather for that in the words following,Apparet. ea quae dixi. ex his eſſe, quae fieri poſſe creduntur. he profeſſeth, that ſuch a thing might well enough happen.

               Why,Florim. fabula Ioannae, cap. 6. nu. 2. 
                  Florimondus compared Clauſerus tranſlation into Latin with a French mans tranſlatiō of the ſame into French: and by that he ſaw this tale was not in Chalcocondilas, for 
                     •
                  e found nothing of it in the French mans tranſlation.

               And is this Florimondus reaſon ſo much commended by Baronius, whereby he diſcouers Clauſerus coſinage? Nowe the Vicar of S. fooles be ghoſtly father to them both: for why might not the French man aſwell leaue it out, as Clauſerus put it in?

               Oh, a faithfull tranſlator (asIbid. Fidus interpres praetermittere non auſus fuiſſet, ſi in Graeco exēplari exaratum inueniſſet. 
                  Florimondus notes) durſt not haue left it out, if he had found it in the Greeke.
            
            
               PRO.
               Nor put it in, if he had not found it in the Greeke: durſt he? And why may not we hold Clauſerus as faithfull an Interpreter, as the French man? yea why may not we hold him more faithfull, ſeeing the French man was a Papiſt? for
Gretſer. lib. 2. de iure &c. prohibendi lib. malos, cap 10. Papiſts hold it lawfull, in tranſlating to omitt offenſiue matter: and ſo doth no Proteſtant. If Florimondus or Baronius could haue named the place where a man might haue ſeene a Greeke copie, in which it is not, they had ſaid ſomewhat to purpoſe; but going about to diſproue it by a tranſlation of one of their fellowes, they deale ridiculouſly.
            
            
               PAP.
               Well, if this anſwer pleaſe you not, know further, that it matters not what Chalcocondilas writes of this matter. For in rendering the reaſon why ſhe could not ſo well be knowne to be a woman, he writes: That in the weſterne parts of Italie all (almoſt) ſhaue their beards: wherein he was groſſy deceiued, asIn eo quod de barba radē
                     da aſſerit, turpiter lapſus eſt. Florim. cap. 6. nu. 1.

That, is Iohn called Engliſh, was a woman borne at Mentz, and ſhe ſtudied at Athens going in mans apparell, where ſhe profited ſo well in the arts, that coming to Rome ſhe read there the liberall
 ſciences, and was held ſo ſufficient a reader, that many of the better ſort became her ordinarie hearers. Afterwards with one conſent ſhe was choſen Pope, and liued in it two yeares and vpward. But betaking her ſelfe more then before to idleneſſe and pleaſure, ſhe could not liue continently as ſhe did in her poore eſtate, when ſhe plied her booke diligently: whereupon one day as ſhe went with the Clergie and people of Rome (according to the cuſtome of that time) in ſolemne proceſſion, being attired in Papall manner, ſhe was deliuered of her firſt begotten ſonne, begotten by one of her chamber, neare the temple of Peace, which ſtands in the citie; as is euident by an old marble Image which ſtands there to this day, to denote ſo much in a figure. And hereuppon it is, that when the Popes go from the Vatican to Saint Iohn Laterans, and backe againe, they go not the direct way thither, but by other ſtreetes further about, and ſo make their iourney longer. Thus Theodoricus de Niem.

Which in effect ſounds thus in Engliſh: After this Leo, Iohn Engliſh, by her countrev of Mentz, ſate two yeares, fiue moneths, and foure dayes. This Pope (as they ſay) was a woman, & being caried in her youth in mans apparell to Athens, by one who was in loue with her, ſhe profited ſo much in diuerſe kinds of learning, that ſhe had no fellow: in ſo much that coming to Rome, and reading there Grammer, Logicke and Rhetoricke, ſhe had of the greateſt Rabbins there many auditors and ſcholers. And being much eſteemed of in that Citie, both for her life and learning, with one voice ſhe was choſen Pope. Now in the time of her Papacy, ſhe was got with child by ſome of her familiars: and not knowing ſhe was ſo neere her reckoning, as ſhe went from Saint Peters to Saint Iohn Lateran, betweene the Coloſſe and Saint Clements Church, ſhe was deliuered of a child; but died thereon, and was there (as they ſay) buried. And becauſe the Lord the Pope doth alwayes ſhunne that way, it is thought by ſome, that he doth it in diſlike of the accident. And ſhe is not numbred among the Popes: partly becauſe of her ſexe, partly becauſe of the filthineſſe of her fact. Can they, I ſay, ſhew me any booke written or printed, wherein it is not in Polonus thus? Doth not Onuphrius, and Bellarmine, and Bernartius, and Baronius, and N.

A Canon out of a Councel whoſe name is not knowne, may very well be skorned. But would you know why Bellarmine and N. D. did not name him? Queſtionleſſe, not for that they knew not what his name was: but becauſe he was but a baſe fellow, a Printer, a poore Batchler of the

And what was ſuch a fellow, to carry away ſuch a matter as this, vpon his bare word? But which is more to be marked, this fellow barely ſaith (without any proofe in the world) that the manuſcripts of Marianus Scotus, which are extant, diſcouer the falſhood of them who put this ſtory into the printed Marianus implying, that all Manuſcripts, not the ancient only, want it. Which neither Bellarmine, nor N. D. durſt or dare auouch, the contrary being confeſſed directly by Baronius, and may out of themſelues be gathered by conſequence.

 to be the originall of Sigebert: which yet N. D. auoucheth as confidently, as if he had held the candle while Sigebert wrote it. Neither doth Bellarmine tell vs, to whom Molanus told this: or in what booke he writ this. So that yet there is no iuſt proofe brought, that ſo much as one copie wants it, much leſſe that it is foiſted into ſuch copies as haue it.

               Is there not? hearken then to Florunondus,

               PROT.
               This would haue moued me ſomewhat to beleeue, that the copie in that Monaſterie wants this, if Florimondus had ſworne for the ſatisfying of his reader, touching the truth of his report: as he vrged the Franciſcan to ſweare to him for the iuſtifying of that which he told. But Florimondus deliuers it barely of his word. And I haue found him oft falſe of his tongue. Wherefore I cannot truſt him.Cap. 27 nu 6. extat adhue Michaelis ad Nicolaum epiſtola, &c. 
                  Florimondus would make vs beleeue, that Michael the Emperours letter ſent to Pope Nicolas, wherein the Emperour obiecteth whatſoeuer might found to the diſgrace of the Romane ſea, is extant to this day: yetAnnal. tom. 10 ad an. 865. nu. 75. Non extant ipſae blaſphemae Michaelis ad Imperatorem literae—traditae ſunt igni. 
                  Baronius teſtifieth that they are not extant. He writes, that the Pope burnt them. Yea Florimondus himſelfe in anotherChap. 10 nu. 4. chapter (forgetting the prouerbe, Mendacem eſſe memorem oportet) confeſſeth, that they are loſt. Yet be it ſo, that the copie which is in that Monaſterie wants this. Vnleſſe Florimondus can proue that it is the originall, or truly copied out of the originall, he ſpeaks not to the point, as I ſhall ſhew by and by.

               Yea but he proues that it is the very originall it ſelfe. For there (asFlorimond. cap. citat. nu. 5. he ſaith) Sigebert liued, there he wrote this booke with his owne hand, there he left it at his death as a monument of his loue. There it is ſhewed by the Monkes to ſuch as come thither, for arare and ancient monument.
            
            
               PROT.
               Sigebert liued not there, when he writ that book. He writ both that, and many others, in the Monaſtery of S. Vincentius, within the citie of Metenſis. Which I ſpeake not of mine owne head, as Florimondus doth, but out ofSigebertus eū in coenobio S. Vincentij. Metenſi ad inſtruendos pueros eſſet poſitus, ſcripſit Hiſtoriarū lib.

               Yet you cannot diſproue Florimondus in that which he ſaith of his dying there: and bequeathing of that booké by his will, to that Monaſterie for a legacie.

               No indeed. But neither can he proue his owne ſaying. Now you know that Actori, non reo, incumbit probatio: The plaintiffe, & not the defendant, muſt bring in his proofe. That which is nakedly affirmed, is ſufficiently anſwered whē it is barely denied. Si dicere, probare eſt: pari ratione, inficiari, refutare eſt: as you may reade inLib. 3. de Rō. Pont. cap. 20.

               No more do the Monkes of Gemble, in my opinion: though it may be, they are rather cozened, then cozeners. For many a Papiſt perſwades himſelfe he hath that, which indeed he hath not. As for example. Many Papiſts are perſwaded they haue that Syndon wherein Chriſts body was lapped, when it was interred, wherein (as they ſay) is to be ſeene to this day the picture of Chriſt: whereas indeed

And in like maner are they themſelues deceiued in their conceit of other relickes. But
 that which makes me moſt ſuſpicious of your Monkes of Gemble, is this. I haue read, that among many other goodly relickes which are ſhewed at Rome by the Popes commandement, there is a Bible ſhewed, which they ſay was written by S. Ierome himſelfe, euen with his owne hands: and yet one of your owne profeſſion profeſſeth freely, that he peruſing it throughly, found it was written by the commandement of one king Robert, and by a bungling ſcriuener.

Now I ſuppoſe, if we had acceſſe to Gemble in Flanders, perhaps we might find as much for diſcouering of their falſhood, in that which they report of the originall of Sigebert: as your fellow found for the diſcouering of the others falſhood, who gaue out, that the Bible which they ſhewed was of S.

               Be it ſo. But will you thereupon conclude, that the Author neuer writ it? I preſume you are not ſo ignorant, but you know, that words, ſentences, and memorable accidents, haue ſometimes by negligence, ſometimes by wilfulneſſe, bene left out of copies: as for example, the words (no not the Sonne of man, Marke 13. 32. whereon yourApologie

 that time. Yea he writes, that at the next Seſſion ſhe appeared againe, ſtaring in the Popes face as before, and could not be feared away with flinging of ſtickes, or with whooping, till one feld her with a ſticke, and ſo killed her.

               That Anaſtaſius, who was degraded by Leo the
4. and the Councell, was he (asDe vitis Pont. in vita Bened. 3. 
                  Platina ſheweth) who ſtood vp Antipope againſt Benedict the 3. It was not this Anaſtaſius, Which you may learne of him, who made the Index Alphabeticall, for the more readie finding out of the moſt memorable points in Anaſtaſius Chronicle: forIn Indice littera a. verbo Anaſtaſius. he diſtinguiſheth Anaſtaſius Bibliothecarius, from Anaſtaſius degraded by Leo, and ſet vp in oppoſition againſt Benedict the 3. But let Anaſtaſius be of as great reputation as you are diſpoſed to haue him of. How ſoone after Leo his death, doth Anaſtaſius report, that the clergie choſe Benedict the 3? Can you tell me that?

That is, The moſt holy Pope Leo the 4. died in the Lord the 16. of the Calends of Auguſt, and was buried at S. Peters, and the Biſhopricke was voide 15. daies. Now preſently vpon his death, the whole Romane Clergie with all the nobles, and commons, and officers of the citie met: and as one man agreed that Benedict ſhould be their Pope.
               
            
            
               PROT.
               They all lie falſly. For the words (Et ceſſauit Epiſcopatus dies 15.) are not to be found (as before I told you) in Anaſtaſius. So that whatſoeuer they build vpon this circumſtance
(as the moſt of their building is) is built vpon a falſe foundation, and therefore cannot ſtand. Yet beſides I would haue you know that Anaſtaſius purpoſely paſſed ouer in ſilence diuers things, which touched the Popes. For, Multa de Sergio deſiderari videntur apud Anaſtaſium,Annal. to. 10. ad ann. 847. nu. 6. ſaith Baronius. Anaſtaſius wants many things touching Sergius. Againe, Iohannis 8. res geſtae deſiderantur apud Anaſtaſium, fortaſſis praetermiſſae ob odioſam Photij reſtitutionem, ſaith the ſame
Annal to. 10. ad an. 882. nu. 7. 
                  Baronius. The acts of Iohn the 8. are wanting in Anaſtaſius, perhaps becauſe he was loth to record that odious reſtoring of Photius.

                  Anaſtaſius forbeares to ſpeake of Luitprandus ſacking S. Peters Church, which is without the wals of Rome. And ſo doth Paulus Diaconus too. Not for that he was ignorant of that fact, ſith he liued in the ſame time, but for that he was loath by telling truth to diſcredite Luitprandus. Wherefore let vs leaue Anaſtaſius, and come vnto the next, who liuing in thoſe dayes, paſſeth ouer Pope Ioane in ſilence.

               Nay ſtay a little: for though neither Bellarmine nor Baronius mention Ademarus, (for ſo is his right name, and not Audomarus, as it is erroneouſly printed) where they speake of this matter: yet Ademarus is mentioned by Genebrard and Onuphrius, where they treat of this matter, as B. C. obſerued well, in hisPag. 296. and 297.

                  Salmeron ſtands much. If their oppoſites writings were not extant, by their anſwers, we had neuer heard of ſuch an obiection. Wherefore if you would perſwade me that theſe eager enemies obiected not this againſt the Pope, you muſt bring better proofe thereof then this, that you find no foot-ſtepping of it in the anſwers made vnto them.

He ſignified vnto him, that no mā could, with a good cōſcience, obey any ſuch mandats as he ſent, though they came from the higheſt order of Angels.

Yea he promiſed ſuch warriers not onely forgiueneſſe of ſinnes for their owne vſe, but forgiueneſſe of ſinnes for their parents alſo.

               No, not I.

               If this be no good argument: Leo the eight is numbred among thee Popes in ſeuen tables that are in the Popes Librarie, or in ſeuen as authenticall as theſe in the Popes Library, ergo Leo the 8. was a Pope: What reaſon haue you to thinke yours good, which is this in effect: Ioane the woman Pope is not numbred among the Popes in ſeuen tables which are in the Popes Librarie: Ergo there was no ſuch Ioane a woman Pope? If ſeuen tables ſpeaking out for a Pope, do not conuince the being of ſuch a Pope: why ſhould their ſilence conuince the not being of a Pope? Might they not as well leaue out one who had bene Pope, as put in one who neuer was Pope?

               Partly for her ſexes ſake, becauſe ſhe was a woman; and partly in regard of the filthineſſe of her fact. For ſo your ſtories note. And this need not ſeeme ſtrange to you, if you would but obſerue that other Popes, vpon other occaſions, haue bene paſſed by, by diuers, as no Popes.

If Pope Ioane were omitted for the filthineſſe of her fact, why was that cloſe ſtoole reſerued; and that monument of hers, whereof you told me before, ſet vp in one of the high ſtreetes in Rome? For the ſtoole and the image were as like to continue the memorie of her, as any record in writing. To be plaine with you, I do not ſee how you can rid your hands of contradiction in this point.

May not ſome thinke good to continue the memory of that, which others, for ſhame of the world, would haue forgotten?See Le Frane diſcours, printed anno. 1602. Did not ſome of your fellow Papiſts in France denie, that Iohn Chaſtell was taught by the Ieſuits to murther Henry the 4. of France, becauſe they were loth to make the Ieſuits odious: and yet did not others helpe to erect a pillar of ſtone neare to the kings pallace, whereby ſo much was notified? If any man ſhould affirme, that the ſame man who omitted Pope Ioane for the filthineſſe of her fact, erected ſuch a monument of her in the ſtreets, and preſcribed ſuch a ſtoole to be kept for ſuch a purpoſe, I know not how he could deliuer himſelfe from contradiction. But ſpeaking of diuers men, his ſpeech hangeth wel enough together: there is no ſhew of contradictiō in it. For further proofe where of, it is worthy your conſideration, that when Paul the third, moued with the ſpirit of God (asIn his Reioynder to M. luel about the Maſſe pag. 177. 
                  Harding ſaith) and deſirous to reforme the Church, gaue charge to his beſt learned, wiſeſt and moſt godly zealous men that he knew, 4 Cardinals, three Biſhops, and two
 others, to enquire and ſearch out what abuſes and diſorders were in the Church, and eſpecially in the Court of Rome: which they did, offering vp vnto him a libel containing the ſumme of all their proceedings. Some thought their labors worthy of regiſtring: others thought them fitter to be burnt, which appeares by this, that the libell is printed in Crabs edition of the Councell, anno 1551. and yet put into the Index librorum prohibitorum, by Paul the 4, (one of thoſe foure Cardinals who exhibited it to Paule the 3:) and left out of Dominicus Nicolinus his edition of the Councels at Venice, auspiciis Sixti Quinti, in the yeare 1585. and out of Seuerinus Binnius his edition at Colen, 1606.

Marry I had rather thought you would haue taken exception againſt me, in reſpect that Platina aſcribes this cuſtome of the Popes, in changing their names, to Iohn the 12. who being called Octauian before his Papacie,Non ignoro Plat tinam, qui ſaepius in alijs etiā rebus lapſus eſt, hanc conſuetudinem Ioh. 12. acceptā referre, &c. Florim. cap. 30. nu. 5. thought that name too warlicke for him after he was made Pope, and therefore tooke the name of Iohn. Now I could eaſily haue replied vnto this. For beſides that Platina ſpeakes amiſſe in many other points, it is not likely that Iohn the twelfth made any conſcience by what name he was called, ſeeing he liued as licentiouſly after he was Pope, as before.

 ſhe were yong, that was againſt the cuſtome to chuſe yong Popes, as may appeare by the great number of Popes that liued in that dignitie, aboue the number of Emperours that ſucceeded often in their youth. But if ſhe were old when ſhe was choſen, then how did ſhe beare a child publikely in proceſſion, as you heretickes affirme? Anſwer me this: for to this Sutcliffe ſaith nothing in his anſwer to Parſons, as he cals him. And no maruell, for nothing can with any colour be pretended, as B. C. aſſures himſelfe, in hisLib. 2. p. 303. Dolefull knell of Thomas Bell.
            
            
               PROT.
               I deny the ground of this your reaſon, to wit, That this Pope Ioane was either yong, or old, when ſhe was choſen. ForDe Galeni ſententia vniuerſae vitae ſex ſunt omnino aetates, Leonard. Fuſchius Inſtitut. Medicin lib. 1. cap. 5. learned men deuide the whole courſe of mans life, not into youth, and old age, as you do: but into pueritiam, pubertatem, adoleſcentiā, iuuentutem, conſtantem, mediamue & ſenectutem. Now middle age is from 35, to 49: whereof ſhe might haue bene, and ſo neither old, nor yong: for Leo the 10. was choſen Pope at 38. yeares of age. For he was not 46. yeares of age when he died, and yet he ſate as Pope

N. D. whoſe ſteps you follow, hath one good propertie: for he is alwaies like himſelfe; he is no changeling. He began with lies, and goeth on with fooleries; yet in giuing the reaſon why it was not the cuſtome to chuſe yong Popes, he ſhewes himſelfe moſt foole. For the multitude of Popes aboue the Emperours, came not by reaſon of their age, but by other accidents. In the firſt
300 yeares, while the Popes were generally good, they were cut off by martirdome. For though it be not true, (as
Annotat. in Plat. in vita Higini. 
                  Onuphrius notes wel) that all the Popes from S. Peters time to Sylueſter, were martyrs: which yet is confidently auouched byBriſtow in his table of Popes. ſome Papiſts: it is true (I grant) that the moſt of them were martyrs. Now in ſucceeding times, their number grew the greater by their poyſoning, and euill entreating one of another. If you peruſe diligently the ſtories of their liues, you ſhall find that of fortie Popes, alreadie dead and gone to their owne place, there was not one that ſate a full yeare: you ſhall finde that within compaſſe of nine yeares, or little aboue,See Faſciculus Temp. ad ann. 904. there were nine ſeuerall Popes: you ſhall finde,Teſte Bennone Cardinale in vita Hildebrand that one man, in 13. yeares, poyſoned ſixe Popes: you ſhall find, that God in his iuſtice cut them off, for their wicked and abhominable liues.

               PAP.
               Yea,N. D. nu. 35. pag. 403. but it is a moſt vnlikely thing, that the whole Romane Clergie would chuſe a Pope without a beard, eſpecially a ſtranger.
            
            
               PROT.
               And why might not the Romane Clergie, as well as the Clergie of Conftantinople (N. D. nu 28. p. 396. Bell. lib. 3 de Ro. Pon. c. 24. whom you vpbraid with ſuch a fact) do ſuch a deed? eſpecially if all your Clergie in thoſe dayes (as ſome of you write) were ſhauen? For men by ſhauing may make themſelues looke like women, and women by often ſhauing may make themſelues looke like men. Certainly aIohan. Pierias Valerianus pro ſacerdotum barbis. fol. 21. ad Cardinal. Medicen. printed at London in aedib. Tho. Bertholet. anno 1533. learned man among your ſelues, imputes the error of Ioane the womans choice to this, that your Clergie were then ſhauen. For by the meanes of ſhauing (ſaith he) the people were ſo diſguiſed, that men and women were ſcant knowne aſunder. And by this it happened that a woman was choſen Pope of Rome, to the perpetuall rebuke of that ſame holy order. The ſame reaſon is giuen alſo by
Lib. 6. de reb. Turcicis. 
                  Chalcocondylas. And by it is another of your arguments anſwered, which byN. D. nu. 35. p. 403. N. D. is touched in theſe words: How did they not diſcerne her to be a woman or an Eunuke, ſeeing ſhe had no beard in her old age? For it being ordinary, that the Clergie ſhould be ſhauen, why ſhould they diſlike her the more for want of a beard?

               That her louers did not diſcouer her, it is no wonder. For partners in miſchiefe, are good at concealements. As for her incontinent life, that diſcouered her at length.

                   holds opinion, that if there had bene any ſuch Pope, the Romanes could haue done no leſſe (in equitie) then to haue hanged her vp in chaines after her death. Becauſe he finds not that ſhe was ſhamefully enough handled after her death, he denies the ſtory.

                  Papyrius Maſſo is a worthy man indeed.Vltimo ſupplicio affeciſſent. 
                  Vt ventus fumum, euaneſcere totam in auras fabulam fecit: he hath diſproued this tale throughlyLoco citato. in Baronius iudgement. But yet I thinke with Florimondus, they ſhould haue allowed her Chriſtian burial: they ſhould haue made her a tombe: they ſhould haue written Epitaphs on her.
            
            
               PROT.
               What? Epitaphs on ſuch a whore? That had bene a ieaſt indeed. Yet perhaps ſome mad-cap did ſo. And how proue you the contrary?
            
            
               PAP.
               If ſhe had had a tombe made for her, and Epitaphs on her they would haue bene forth coming. For asLoco citato. 
                  Florimondus writes, Sepulchrorum nunquam intermoritur memoria: Tombeſtones continue for euer.
            
            
               PROT.
               Indeed I hauePolyd. Virg. de inuent. rerum. lib. 6. cap. 10. read, that by law it was prouided, that no man ſhould deface Tombe-ſtones. And I haueBellonius lib. 2 obſeruat. cap. 6. read alſo, that to this day, hard by Troy, videre licet magna marmorea ſepulchra operis antiqui ex vno lapide, inſtar ciſtae, excauata, quorū opercula adhuc integra ſunt: a man may ſee many marble ſepulchres, wrought after the old faſhion, cut hollow, like a cheſt, out of one ſtone, the couers whereof are ſtill whole. But I do not reade, that men can ſhew, which was Priamus his graue, which Hectors, &c. Yet but for euill fingers, I could haue told you where Pope Ioanes tombe was. Til Pius Quintus caſt it into Tiber, it was to be ſeene in Rome.

               They ſay further, that ſhe died inſtantly. But though the paines of women be great at ſuch times, yet it comes by thro

               PAP.
               Was ſhe deliuered of the boy wherewithall ſhe went? and what was then the cauſe of her death? Florimondus accounts this as one of the abſurdities which followes on this tale. Imò, vt aiunt,
(Pag. 205. ſaith he) maſculum pepererat, quid igitur mortem repentinam attulit? If a woman be once deliuered of the fruite of her wombe, there is no danger of death in his opinion.

                  Platina reports onely that the Vatican was repaired by Boniface the ninth. He ſaith not, it was firſt inhabited by Boniface the 9. though if he had, yet the Pope might well haue gone to ſee the Lateran; for he had other houſes to ſolace himſelfe, and his Courtiers in, beſides the Lateran. He dwelt not alwaies in that: forDe vitis Pontif in vita Greg. 4. 
                  Gregory the fourth, made two goodly houſes euen out of the ground, for the Popes vſe, as your Anaſtaſius

But beſides, the ſtories do not report ſhe went from S. Peters pallace to the pallace of the Lateran: but from S. Peters Church to the Lateran Church. For ſhe was deliuered as they went in proceſſion. Now ſhe might go from S. Peters Church to the Lateran Church, and yet dwell in the pallace by the Lateran. For Popes began not alwaies their proceſſions at the next Church to them.Platina in vita Leon. 3. & Anaſtaſ. de vit. Pont. in Leone 3.

For to promiſe the reedifying of a Church in three daies, is neither fellonie nor treaſon. And in this reſpect S.

Florim. cap. 7. nu. 1. why Marianus the firſt broacher of this tale, gaue her ſuch a new fangled, and new deuiſed name as Ioane? Why tooke he that name which in former ages was proper to men onely, and by changing a letter made it a womans name? Florimondus cannot reach the reaſon of this.

                  Florimondus is a proper Squire, and you are a wiſe man to demand ſuch a queſtion. Reade the Scriptures, and you ſhall find, that the name of Ioane is no new deuiſed name, nor proper to men onely. ForLuk. 8. 3. and 24. 10. they mention one Ioane, the wife of Chuza. Or, if for feare of prouing an hereticke you dare not reade the Scriptures, reade your Legends and Feſtiuals, and in them you ſhall find that your Sea-ſaint Nicolas his mother was called Ioane.

In ſome of later time I find ſome difference, one calling her Gilbert, and another Agnes. But of all thoſe whom I brought in, to giue in euidence againſt her, there is not paſt one or two, who either before, or after her Papacie, giues her any other name then Ioane. And for ought I know, there
 is no man, either old, or yong, who euer chriſtened her Dorothie, or Iutta, or Iſabell, or Margaret. Know you any that haue done ſo?

                  Onuphrius, and that vpon the reaſon which you mentioned. For theſe are Onuphrius words. Iohannes hic omnino 8. non 9. eſt, vt à Platina deſcribitur: Nam etſi Iohannes foemina Papa, quam profitetur, fuiſſet, non tamen numeri notam habere debuiſſet ſacri ordinis non capax: that is, This Iohn queſtionleſſe is the eighth, and not the ninth, as Platina accounts him: for though Iohn the woman, whom he talkes of, had bene Pope, yet ſeeing ſhe was not capable of Prieſthood, ſhe ſhould not go for one in the number of Iohns.

                  Platina ſtiles her not Iohn the eighth. Onuphrius, or ſome bodie for him, hath abuſed both Platina and you. For proofe whereof I appeale to Platina, printed in the yeare
1481.Platina moritur Romae, anno 1481. Trith. de ſcript. Eccleſiaſt. verbo Bartholomaeus. which was the yeare wherin Platina died; and to the next edition Anno 1485. For ſpeaking of Iohn the woman in thoſe ancient editions, he ſets no numerall note vpon her head, but begins his ſtorie thus, Iohannes Anglicus, ex Maguntiaco oriundus, &c. Iohn Engliſh, borne at Mentz. Neither ſtiles he the next 9. but 8. For coming to that Popes life, Iohannes

For further proofe of which later point, I appeale to theSuch as that of Colen, anno 1574. later editions, whereunto Onuphrius annotations are annexed. For though we reade thus in them, Iohannes nonus, patria Romanus, &c. Iohn the ninth, by his countrey a Romane, &c. yet, that that reading is falſe, and the ancient reading true, it appeares by that which is written of the next Popes life, to wit, Martin the ſecond, euen in thoſe later editions. ForDe vit. Pont. in vita Martini 2 
                  Platina ſhewing how Martin liued in the time of Charles the third, addes preſently, quem ab Iohanne 8. coronam accepiſſe ſcripſimus, that is, who was crowned by Iohn the eighth, as we haue written. Now Charles the third was crowned by Iohn next before Martin, according toIn vita eiuſdē Ioh. 
                  Platina. Wherefore the next before Martin was Iohn the 8. in Platina his account, and not Iohn the ninth, as Onuphrius would make vs beleeue. Which
 ouerſight, or fraud of Onuphrius, was not ſo great, but that by this meanes he is forced to alter Platina his numerall note, ſet to all the Iohns that follow, to call him Iohn the tenth, whom Platina cals Iohn the ninth; to call him the eleuenth, whom Platina cals the tenth; to call him the thirteenth, whom Platina cals the twelfth, and ſo vnto the laſt Baldeſar Coſſa, who was in number of Iohns according to the ancient editions, the 23, and not the 24, as he is numbred in the editions with Onuphrius notes.

                  Polonus writes, that ſhe ſucceeded Leo the 5. And ſo dothIn chron. ad an. 847. collat. cum anno 854. 
                  Sigebert too.
            
            
               PROT.
               That Leo, whom Sigebert placeth next before Ioane the woman, is numbred the fifth, it is ſome error in the print. ForSigebert names Leo the firſt, ad an. 441. Leo the 2. ad an. 684. Leo the 3. ad an. 796 and the next is that Leo who ſate ad an. 847. he names but three Popes of that name before that Leo. Wherefore when Sigebert is corrected, you haue no colour of exception from him. No more haue you from
 
                  Polonus. For though according to his account, Leo before this woman Pope, be Leo the fifth: yet he is the ſame man whom others call Leo the fourth. Polonus reckens one Leo, as Pope in the yeare 698, whom others recken not at all, which is the cauſe of the difference betweene him and others in the account of Leoes that follow. But in the perſons all agree. What is the next diſagreement?

               If this be true, Bellarmine was farre wide. ForLib. 3. de Ro. Pont cap. 24. he writes, that Omnes qui iſtum Iohannem admittunt, dicunt eum vixiſſe in Pontificatu duobus annis, & quinque menſibus. All that acknowledged ſuch a woman Pope, ſay, ſhe ſate as Pope two yeares, and fiue moneths. He knew none (no more then 1) that gaue her ſo litle time as foure moneths. He knew no ſuch difference herein as you talke of. Yet among the later writers, I confeſſe there is ſome difference of ſome few moneths: but Marianus and Polonus, which are two of the principall, agree vpon the point. They write vniformly, that ſhe ſate two yeares, fiue moneths, and foure daies. And Platina is not farre ſhort of that ſumme. For by his reckoning, ſhe ſate two yeares, one moneth, and foure daies. But ſuppoſe the differences in theſe circumſtances were great, and many: what is that to diſcredit the ſubſtance of the ſtorie? We find great difference among them who haue written of Pope Lucius. ForPlatina de vit. Pont. in vita Lucij 1. Onuphr. in Chron. Rom. Pont. ad ann. 253. ſome ſay, he was a Romane,Anaſtaſius in vita Lucij. ſome a Tuskan;Idem ibid. ſome ſay he was the ſonne of Lucinus,

                  Bellarmine ſaith true in this, (though he miſſe the truth often) that ſaepiſſimè accidit vt conſtet de re, & non conſtet de modo, vel alia circumſtantia. It oftentimes fals out that men are ſure ſuch a thing is done, when yet they are not ſure of the manner how it was done, or of ſome other ſuch like circumſtance.

                   import (thinke you) that in Syneſius opinion there was no vniuerſitie at Athens? I for my part do rather thinke the contrary: I thinke Syneſius meant thereby that Athens was an vniuerſitie, though nothing ſo floriſhing as formerly. Queſtionleſſe, whenPetrus Abailardus nihil habens de Monacho praeter nomen & habitum Bern. Epiſt. 193. 
                  Bernard writ, that Peter Abailard had nothing of a Monke, ſauing the name and the Cowle, his meaning was not that Peter was no Monke, but rather that he was a Monke, though a ſorrie Monke. And I am the rather perſwaded to vnderſtand Syneſius words ſo: becauſe Athens, in S. Baſils time (about ſome
40. yeares before Syneſius)Baron. Annal. to 3. ad an. 354. nu. 25. & 26. was held the mother of learning: and in regard thereof termed golden Athens by
In Monodia in Baſilij magni vitam. 
                  Gregory Nazienzen. For who can thinke, in ſo few yeares learning ſhould quite be quenched, and that ſo famous an vniuerſitie ſhould in ſo ſhort time be vtterly decayed? But let vs ſuppoſe there was no vniuerſity at Athens in Syneſius time. What is that to proue that there was no Vniuerſitie at Athens in Pope Ioanes time, which was 400. yeares after? That vniuerſitie might get life againe in ſo many yeares. And in deed it did ſo: for 100. yeares after Syneſius time, Bocthuis went to ſtudie at Athens, asAnnal. 10. 6. ad an 510 nu. 2. 
                  Baronius confeſſeth: noting further, that the ſtudie of Philoſophy was reuiued there in thoſe dayes. Againe, to ſuppoſe there was no vniuerſitie at Athens in Syneſius time, what is it to proue that there were no ſchooles in any part of Grecia in Pope Ioanes time? Now Bellarmine promiſed to proue that.

                  Bellarmine wrongs Cedrenus and Zonaras, in bringing them in, to witneſſe ſuch a point. For they ſay no more, but that learning was not regarded of along time before Bardus Caeſar. They ſay not, it was quite extinct,Philoſophia neglecta iacebat ac propè omnino extincta erat. vt neſcintilla quidem eius appareret. but almoſt extinct. Bardus Caeſar added life vnto-it,Cuique diſciplinae ſcholas conſtituit, & do ctores deſignauit, ſingulis publica ſtipendia decreuit. by ſetting vp ſchooles for euery of the liberall ſciences, and appointing publicke profeſſors, and giuing them ſtipends out of the Excheker, as Cedrenus and Zonaras write: but he raiſed it not vp ſimply to life. For if it had bene ſtarke dead, how could he vpon ſuch a ſodaine haue gotten profeſſours to furniſh his ſchooles? Againe, do we not reade in the ſame Zonaras, that at the ſame time whereof Bellarmine ſpeakes, there was a

But the difference among hiſtorians about the number of Iohn-Popes, aroſe not from that time, and about that occaſion. It aroſe in Pope Iohn the 12. his time, about the yeare 955.

For they who ſpake of her, were not to ſet any numerall note vpon her head, asPag. 70. before I ſhewed you out of Onuphrius. They were not to reckon one Iohn the more for her. Neither indeed did any hiſtorian before Platina, recken her in the number of Iohns, though they called her by the name of Iohn.

For the difference which is about the number of Iohns, aroſe not from Iohn the 12, but from this woman Ioane.

If Leo the 4. liued to the yeare 855, then Marianus Scotus lyed falſly in reporting that this Ioane was choſen Pope in the yeare 853: for by his confeſſion ſhe ſucceeded Leo the fourth. But Leo the 4. liued to the yeare 855. Ergo Marianus Scotus lyed falſly in reporting that this Ioane was choſen Pope in the yeare 853.

                  Baron. ibid. By his owne wosds. For thus he writes. Anno octingenteſimo quinquageſimo tertio Leo Papa obijt Kalend. Auguſti. Huic ſucceſſit Ioanna mulier annis duobus, menſibus quinque, diebus quatuor. In the yeare 853. Leo the Pope died on the Kalends of Auguſt: and Ioane the woman ſucceeded after him for the ſpace of two yeares fiue moneths, and foure dayes.
            
            
               PROT.
               Theſe are not Marianus words. For he ſets not downe the yeare preciſely, but in numerall figures, by the ſide of the text.See Marianus chronicle, & the caſe wil appeare to be plaine. And it is plaine, by conference of yeares, that he meant to note out the 855 for her entrance, and not the 853. For Benedict the 3. who ſucceeded her, entred not
(by his account) till the yeare 857. Now if ſhe had entred
853, ſhe had bene Pope foure yeares, or thereabouts. For betweene 853. and 857. there runne foure yeares; whereas in plaine words he notes, that ſhe was Pope but two yeares, fiue moneths, and foure dayes. Secondly, it is plaine by Marianus Scotus, that Sergius the 2. began his popedome in the yeare 844. and ſate three yeares. It is plaine. that Leo the fourth, next ſucceſſor to Sergius, began his in the yeare 847, and ſate eight yeares. Now put theſe three odde ſummes
4, 3, and 8, to 840, and they will make 855. So that whoſoeuer ſucceeded Leo the 4, muſt begin in the yeare 855; and that was Ioane the woman, in Marianus opinion.

               Why, but right ouer againſt theſe figures 853, theſe words are ſet: Leo Papa obijt Kal. Aug. Leo the Pope died on the Kalends of Auguſt. And doth not that argue, that in Marianus opinion, Leo died that yeare?
            
            
               PROT.
               No. No more then the words following, Huic ſucceſſit Ioanna mulier, &c. which are ſet iuſt ouer againſt theſe figures 854. do argue that ſhe began her popedome the next yeare after: or that Leo the 4. began his popedome in the yeare 852, becauſe right ouer againſt that number, his entrance vpon Sergius death is mentioned. Is not your
 next argument better?

                  Baronius notes: and not in that age wherin Pope Ioane liued. But do you thinke that euery Pope in that age inaugured ſome Dukes or Princes, or Kings, or Emperours? I would gladly know of you what Duke, or Prince, or King, or Emperour was inaugured, or crowned by Pope Eugenius the 2, who ſate in the yeare 824, or by Pope 
                     Ʋalentinus, who ſate in the yeare 827, or by Pope Gregory the 4. who ſucceeded Valentinus: or by Pope Sergius the ſecond, who fate in the yeare 844. or by Pope Leo the 4, who ſate in the yeare 847. I am ſure neuer a one of theſe crowned any Emperour. And I remember not that any one of theſe annoynted any Duke, or King, ſaue Leo the 4, who annoynted Alfred the yongeſt ſonne of Athelwulfus king of England. Which furthered him nothing to the attaining of the kingdome. For till the death of his three elder brethren, for all the Popes annoynting him, he liued like a ſubiect, he liued not like a king. Wherefore to put you in mind of the maine point; though Pope Ioane inaugured, or crowned no ſuch perſons as you ſpeake of, yet you cannot conclude therupon: Ergo, there was no Pope Ioane.

If the report of Pope Ioane be not afabulous fiction, then Nicolas the firſt Pope of that name, who at the time of her election was a Cardinall, gaue her a voice, and ſo conſented to her election. But it is not credible that Nicolas gaue her a voice, and conſented to her election. Ergo.

               Firſt, I denie that Nicolas was a Cardinall at the time of Pope Ioanes election. For he was madeAnaſtaſ. Biblioth. in vita Nicolai 1. Subdeacon by Sergius the ſecond, andIbid.

Secondly, I denie we are bound to beleeue that he gaue Pope Ioane his voice, though we ſhould grant he was a Cardinall. For it was neuer required, that all the Cardinals ſhould giue conſent to any Popes election. But principally I denie your minor propoſition, viz. that it is not credible Nicolas gaue her his voice, and conſented to her election. And how can you proue it?

If Nicolas had giuen her a voice, and conſented to her election, then could he not honeſtly haue reproued Photius Patriarke of Conſtantinople, for that he ſuffered himſelf of a meere layman to be made a Patriarke.Imperatorem ipſum acerrima reprehenſio

               Oh is that it? As though there were not a maine difference betweene Nicolas his fact (to ſuppoſe he did it) and the fact of Photius and the Emperour. Photius and the Emperour did that wittingly and willingly, which Nicolas reproues in them. Nicolas choſe a woman Pope vnwittingly. It was with Nicolas (in all likelihood) at the election of Pope Ioane, as it was with the2. Sam. 1511. 200 of Ieruſalem, who were called by Abſalon to Hebron: of whom the Scriptures witnes that they went in their ſimplicitie, knowing nothing.

About 170 yeares after this deuiſed election of Pope Ioane (to wit, vpon the yeare of Chriſt 1020) the Church and Patriarke of Conſtantinople being in ſome contention with Rome, Pope Leo the ninth wrote a long letter to Michael the Patriarke of Conſtantinople, reprehending certaine abuſes of that Church, and among other, that they were ſaid to haue promoted Eunukes to prieſthood, and thereby alſo a greater inconuenience falne out, which was, that a woman was crept to be Patriarke.N D. lib. citat nu. 29. pag. 398. Now (no doubt) Leo would neuer haue durſt to write thus, if the Patriarke might haue returned the matter backe vpon him againe, and ſaid: This was but a ſlanderous report, falſly raiſed againſt the Church of Conſtantinople, but that a woman indeed had bene promoted in the Romaine Church.

Now that is a ſlabbie ground, as may appeare by this, that it is ordinarie with you Papiſts to obiect that againſt others, whereof your ſelues ſtand moſt guiltie. It is ordinarie with you Papiſts, to call your enemies, whores firſt. Do not you complaine with open mouthes of vs Miniſters, for want of continencie? and yet is it not well knowne, that your prieſts and monkes,Ier. 5. 8. like fed horſes, haue neighed after their neighbours wiues: and your Nunnes haue opened their feete (toEzech. 16. 25. vſe the Prophets phraſe when he ſpeaketh of ſuch like light skirts) to euery one that paſſed by, and haue multiplied their whoredomes?

            The generall conſent of all that euer haue throughly conuerſed with Parſons, is this, (ſaithQuodlibet of Religion and ſtate. pag. 236.

And is not this railing? Now if this be thus (to returne to the maine point) why may we not thinke the Church of Rome to be faulty in electing Pope Ioane, though Leo reproued the Church of Conſtantinople with the ſame?

Whereupon in reproach he was called, non Papa, ſed Papiſſa. And vpon that reprochfull ſpeech, came this tale of a woman Pope.

               Yes marry is he. For hauing ſet downe Pope Leo his words touching that rumour: Quae ita erant fama vulgata de Eccleſia Conſtantinopolitana, conuerſa in Romanam Eccleſiam à ſchiſmaticis eam odio proſequentibus, & calumnijs proſcindentibus, quis non intelligat?

D. who holds of this later opinion, profeſſeth, that it ſeemeth moſt certaine, that in Pope Leo his time, viz. 1020, there was not ſo much as any rumour or mention of any woman Pope that euer had bene in the Romane Church. So doth Baronius himſelfe: for verily (Certè ſi vel leuiſſimus rumuſculus per calumniam de his ſpar ſus eſſet, vtique is ab eo ſuiſſet antea diluédus, quàm vt fama perlatū facinus eiuldem generis obieciſſet.

Was there not ſo much as a flying report of a woman Pope before Leo the 9 his time, in Baronius opinion? How then did Iohn the 8. occaſion ſuch a report, who liued an 140 yeares before Leo? But let Baronius go with this ſcape. What reaſon haue you to thinke that the rumour of Conſtantinople might occaſion
 this tale againſt Rome?

                  Florim. ca. 25. nu. 3. Good reaſon. For euery man knowes that Conſtantinople was called New Rome, and Rome ſimply. Now a man might eaſily be deceiued, in ſuppoſing that to be done in Rome in Italy, which was reported to be done in Rome, but in Rome in Grecia.
            
            
               PROT.
               That Conſtantinople was called New Rome,Conſtantinop. nouam Romā iam inde à Conſtantini tempore Graeci vocabant. Papyr. Maſſon. lib. 2. de vrbis Epiſc. in Simplicio I eaſily yeeld vnto you. But that it was at any time called ſimply Rome, that your Florimondus is not able to make good. Thats his owne fancie; and in deliuering it he bewrayes his owne folly. Yet to ſuppoſe it true: why did not the relators of it, ſet it downe as hapning in Leo his time, but 240 yeares before: if ſo be it was occaſioned by the report that went of Conſtantinople in Leo his daies? If it had thence begun, it ſhould haue bene regiſtred as then hapning.
            
            
               PAP.
               Well: ſuppoſe it were true: what gaine you by it? or what is the Church preiudiced by her? If Pope Ioane had bene, ſhe had not preiudiced the Church,Part 2. of three Conuerſions, c. 5 pag. 389. ſaith N. D.

               But ſhe had. For if ſhe was Pope, then it will follow thereon neceſſarily, that the Church (according to your learning) once hopt headleſſe. For the Church (inBellar lib. 3. de Eccleſia, cap. 2. your learning) is defined to be a companie of Chriſtian men profeſſing one faith vnder one head, to wit, the Pope. But ſhe, how euer ſhe caried the name of Pope, was no Pope.Rhem. annot. in 1. Cor. 14. v. 34 For a woman is not capable of holy orders. A woman cannot play the Pope. Ergo all the time of Pope Ioane, the Church hopt headleſſe.
            
            
               PAP.
               Indeed the only inconuenience of ſuch a caſe is,Loco ſup. cit. as N. D. confeſſeth, that the Church ſhould lacke a true head for the time. But that is not ſo great a matter: for ſo ſhe doth when any Pope dieth, till another be choſen.
            
            
               PROT.
               What is that you ſay? Doth the Church hop headleſſe, when one Pope dieth, till another be choſen? Now alas what a pitifull caſe is the Church in then? Since Chriſts time
Cicarellus addit. ad Platinam & Onuph. there haue bene aboue 240 Popes. And therefore by your ſaying, the Church hath bene headleſſe aboue 240 times. Yea, and ſometimes betweene the death of one Pope, and

               Yes. But conſidering the body of your doctrine, you may not anſwer ſo, nor think ſo. For you hold that your Pope is head of the Church, and that it is neceſſarie vnto ſaluation to acknowledge him the head: but ſo did not S. Auſtin. You hold that in a true Church one Biſhop muſt lawfully ſucceed another, or all is daſht: but ſo did not Saint Auſtin. For he puts the caſe, that ſome traitor ſubrepſiſſet, that is, had come in vnorderly into the Biſhop of Romes Seate: and yet reſolues, that that was not preiudiciall to Gods
 Church. Conforme your ſelues in theſe two points, of the Popes headſhip, and ſucceſſion, to Saint Auſtins iudgement: and then you may better ſay in this caſe of Pope Ioane, that which Auſtine ſaid in the caſe propoſed: That ſhe had not preiudicated the Church of Chriſt.

               If it be true there was ſuch a Pope, your Church muſt be diſcarded as no true Church. For thus I argue:Briſtow. Motiue. 22. That is no true Church, which cannot giue in plaine authenticall writing, the lawfull, orderly, entire, without any breach, and ſound notorious ſucceſſion of Biſhops. But your Church, if Ioane was Pope, cannot giue in plaine authenticall writing, the lawfull orderly, entire, without any breach, and ſound notorius ſucceſſion of Biſhops. For by reaſon of her Benedict the third, could not orderly ſucceed Leo the fourth. She put in a caueat, or rather, was of her ſelfe a barre to his ſucceſſiō. By her a breach was made in the rank of your Popes. She, no foole, but a whore, marred your play.

               No, no. For all that you can rightly gather vpon her Popedome is, That the Popes ſeate ſtood empty of a lawfull Paſtor for the space of two yeares, and a few odde moneths. Now ſo it did often by reaſon of the differences among the Electors, as you your ſelfe ſhewed. And yet no man durſt ſay, nor could truly ſay, that ſucceſſion failed, asNihil praetereà ex ex eater miſeri nouatotes, lucri capiunt inſi vt dic. poſſit duobus illis annis & menſibus ſedem Pontificiam legitimo vacuam
