               Do reioyse and delyght greatly,
               Such can haue no pleasure in me
               For I teach Christ that Lorde moost hygh.

               Learne, yf thou wylte, vnfaynedly,
               Wherby thou mayst become ryght deare
               To God and his sonne, that Lord moost hygh.
            
            
               To mortify thy lustes carnall
               And to walke aye innocently,
               Teache the also godly I shall
               That thou mayst please that Lord moost hygh.
            
            
               To good workes also I shall the moue
               In them euermore to be busy,
               That God the father maye the loue
               And his sonne Christ that Lorde moost hygh.
            
            
               If thou therfore louest godlynes
               Take me vnto the ioyfully.
               I shall fyll thy harte with gladnes
               And ioyne the wt Christ that Lord moost hygh.

This vndoubtedly was the meanyng of thē, that fyrst were the inuētours of this moost honest and frendly custome, & to this ende hath it ben obserued, kept & mayntayned hytherto.

prepare somthyng, wherby I might shewe my selfe to wysh well vnto all men, and to beare an honest & frendly hart to my cōtrey mē of Englōd. I haue therfore prouided a newe yeres gyfte, not of corruptible gold or syluer, but of the moost sacred scriptures, whiche,Psal. xviii as Dauid saythe, are much more worthy to be desired thē golde or precious stonne, & are sweter then the hony & hony combe.
            In this my newe yeares gyfte I haue openned many goodly & godly thynges. Amonge all other, I haue declared, what a precious treasure Christ is vnto vs,Esay. ix. whiche was gyuē vs of God the father for our new yeres gyfte, and how many benefites we haue receyued by hym. I haue also described the whole lyfe of a christen mā, shewyng what we must do, if we wyll enioy so great benefites. Agen, I haue exhorted men to mortify

theyr carnal affectes & worldly lustes, and shewed them howe they must walke both toward thēselues, theyr neyghbour & God, if they wyl haue the fruicion of the celestiall enheretaūce. To cōclude, as I haue shewed that all saluacion commeth by Christ, so haue I proued that Christ is no sauiour but to thē that repēt, beleue, lede a vertuous lyfe, & be plē
               teous in doyng good workes. These thinges with diuers other not to be despised shal be foūd in this my new yeares gyfte, so that I doubte not, but that it shall be no les profitable for the soule, than other worldly giftes shall be for the body.
            This my labour employed herein after myne so greuous & troublous syckenesses, I dedicate and sende to your ryght worshypfull mastershyp for a newe yeares gyfte, desyrynge you to accepte it wyth no lesse good

mynde, than it is offered to your gē
               tylnes. If I shal may perceaue, that this my lytle gyfte is acceptable vnto you, it shall not only not repente me, but also cause me very much to reioyse of my trauayle ī this behalf.
            GOD the Author of euery yere mought vouchesafe to graunt that this newe yeare wythe many other maye euer begynne vnto you withe good fortune, procede wyth better, ende with that which is best, and alway be fortunate vnto you so long as they last, so yt ye maye alway enioye cō

he maye be fre from these great waues & rockes wherwythe the lyfe of mortall mē is so miserably assayled, & so ofte put in daūger.

               Of these scriptures heretofore rehearsed, is it euident, that Christ is frely giuen vnto vs of God ye father yea & that without oure merites or desertes. For whan we were vtterly

damned, & knewe not howe to recouer ony parte of our helpe, God the father of his own gracious goodnes gaue vs his sonne Christ to be oure Sauioure. So that as the beginnynge of youre Newe yeares gyfte is, Christ is vnfaynedly the gyft of God▪ frely giuen vs for our great cō

               It followeth: That bryngeth saluacion

vnto all men. Beholde, youre newe yeares gyfte, that God the father hath giuen you, bryngeth saluacion vnto all mē. It is no idle & vnprofitable gifte, but commodious & necessary. For it worke the vs health & saluacion.
               The giftes of the world bring many times perdicion, destrucciō & damnacion, but this gyft of God bringeth lyfe, health, ioye, pleasure, saluacion & an whole sea of good thynges. It bringeth saluacion, sayth the scripture. Note this worde bringeth. As though it shoulde be sayd, whā ther was no hope of health, but all thynges yoked in the bond of desperaciō, synne bare rule, & Satan triūphed ouer mankynd as his bond captiue, than came the gifte of God, whiche droue synne out of place, vāquished Satan, destroyed the powers of hel brought saluacion to man, which loked

only for damnacion, yea & that frely, & without ony desertes, euen of mere grace & pure mercye. O the inestimable excellency of this gifte, which both wyllyngly & frely bryngeth saluacion to mankynde. Howe can it otherwyse be? Is not ye name of this our gyfte, IESVS, gyuen hym of God the father,what Iesus signifieth. & published by his Aungell & Embassadoure Gabriel? And what other thyng, I pray you, soundethe IESVS, than a sauioure? This our gyfte Christ,Math. i. is a sauiour. For he saueth his people from theyr synnes. Feare ye not, sayth the aungell. For beholde,Luke. ii. I shewe vnto you a great ioye, which shall chaunse to all people. For this day is borne vnto you a sauiour, whiche is Christ ye Lorde of the cytye of Dauid. Thus sewe, that Christ is a sauiour. Therfore maye he righte well brynge saluacion, & saue so many as beleue in

hym.All saluaciō muste be loked for of Christ

Who so euer seaketh saluaciō at ye hande of ony other,Marke wel. but at Christes alone, he doth not only deceaue hym selfe, but also robbe christ of his office, depriue him of hys glory, blaspheme his blissed name, tread vnder foote his moost precious bloud, & vtterly maketh of none effecte ye whole misterye of Christes incarnacion.

Are not al these scriptures playn inugh to declare that Christ is the sauiour & that there is no saluacion, but by

easeth, refreshethe & conforteth the conforteles. Christ the sonne of man came to seke & saue that, which was lost. Ergo what so euer is lost & saued agen,Luke. xix. is saued by Christ. Christ is that true light, which lighteneth euery man, that commeth into this worlde. Ergo they that are not lightened by Christ,Ioan. i. remayne styl in darkenes. Christ gaue to so many as receaued hym, power to be made the sonnes of God because they beleued in his name. Ergo they that receiue not him to be theyr sauiour, and beleue that theyr synnes are only put awaye by his name, are not the sonnes of God. Christ is that lambe

Ergo so many as go vp into heuen, go vp onely by Christ. He that beleueth in the sonne, hath euerlastyng life. But he that beleueth not in the sonne, shall not se lyfe, but ye wrathe of GOD abydeth vpon hym. Ergo they alone shall be saued, whiche wt a stronge faythe beleue Christ to be theyr Sauioure. Euery one, saythe Christ, that drynketh of the water, that I gyue hym, shall neuermore thyrst.Ioan. iiii Ergo Christ is a sufficient sauiour for so many as repent and beleue.

whiche knowe no synne,ii. Cor. v. became syn for oure sake, that is to saye, a sacrifyce for our synnes. Ergo those synnes that are putte awaye, are putte awaye by ye sacrifyce of christ.

If righteousnes cometh by ye lawe, than dyed christ in vayne. Ergo they that are made rygheteous, are made righteous by the death of christ. And who so euer seketh to be iustified by ony other meanes than by the deth of christ, he goeth about to make christes deth of none effect, and so is he a playne Antechrist. By christ we haue redempcion,Ephe. i. & by his bloude remission of synnes. Ergo by christ is our raunsome payd, and by his bloud are oure synnes forgyuen vs.Ephe. ii. Christ is our peace. Ergo by him

haue we tranquilite, quietnes and rest in our cōsciēces. By christ haue we free entraunce vnto the father.Ephe. ii.iii. Ergo so many as come vnto the father, come by Christ. Christ is gone vp on high,Ephe. iiii. and hath led away captiuite captiue, and hath giuen gyftes vnto men.Psa. lxvii. Ergo he it is that giueth remission of synnes. Christ loued vs, and gaue hymselfe for vs to God an offeryng & swete smellynge sacrifyce.Ephe. v. Ergo for this swete & odoriferous sacrifice of christ, God the father pardoneth our sīnes. Christ is the head of the body of the congregaciō. Ergo he it is,Colos. i. that saueth his members. It hath plesed the father, that in christ al fulnes shuld dwel, & that by him all thynges should be reconcyled vnto hīselfe, whyther they be thynges vpon earth or in heauē, yt thorowe the bloud of his crosse, he myght make peace euen thorow his

alone, marke a fewe wordes, that I shall nowe saye vnto you. Fyrst he yt shall be a sauioure, & saue men from theyr synnes, muste be withoute all synne hym selfe. Secondly he must be both God & mā. Thyrdly he must by his innocency delyuer vs from ye cursse of the law, yea and fulfyll the lawe for vs, that the aduersary may laye nothyng agaynst vs. Fourthly he must by his puyssaunce & power, vanquysh & subdue all the power of Satan. Fyftly he must slaye death, yt it may haue no more power ouer ye faythfull. Syxtly, it must be in his power to gyue vnto hys people the holy Ghost, to gouern & kepe them ī a ryght trade of lyuyng.

God and the offenders.
               If ye can fynde ony suche, as I haue here described, besydes Christ, wel, I wil thā also graūt yt he is a sauiour. Untyll that tyme wyll I say with all the Prophettes, Apostles & our Doctor Paule, that this gyfte of God christ Iesus is thalone sauiour, bryngeth helth, & that there is no saluacion to be gotten, but only thorow hī.

excepte they repēt, beleue & amend. It is not to be passed ouer lyghtly, yt the scriptures spekethe generally and vniuersally wtout ony excepciō To all men.

Paule to the Hebrues and make an end of thys matter, He was tempted & made lyke to vs in all thynges, synne alone excepte. If he were lyke vnto vs in all thynges, synne alone excepte, than followeth it that he had a body of flesh as we haue, and that there was no differēce, but that hys moost blyssed body was wythout all synne, and our bodyes are synful. For he was borne wrapped in cloutes, layd in a maunger, fedde, circumcised, embrased in armes, grewe, was made stronge in ye spirite, profited in wisdome & age, hongred, thyrsted, wepte, was wery reioysed, was moued wt wrathe and indignaciō, sorowed, was heuy, sad,

& at the last suffered the moost spyteful death of the crosse. Are not these very signes & manifest tokēs of mā? Coulde he haue done these thynges, if he had had eyther a fantastical body, or elles a body from heauen? Na verely, for what fantasticall or heauenly thynge hongreth, thyrstethe, wepeth slepeth, reioyseth. &c. which all Christ dyd. A lytle before hys passhon was he not in such an agony, yt his sweat was lyke droppes of bloud tryckelynge downe to the ground?Luke. xxii. Dyd he not so greatly feare deathe, that he desyred his father to wythdrawe the cuppe of hys pashon from hym? Are not all these euident tokens of a verye man, seynge hys flesshe so greatly feared deathe▪ Seyng than that he was very mā, whense had he thys body, but of the moost holy virgine Mary, thorowe the meruelous operaciō of Goddes

               His doctrine is this That we shulde deny vngodlynes and worldely lustes.

We heare here none vnwrytten verites, nor the fansys of men, nor yet olde wyues fables and suche thynges as edify not, but those thynges that haue ben taught of Moses and the Prophettes many yeres before hys commyng, as we maye se in the holy scriptures, therfore maye they not be reiecte and cast a waye. The olde Ethnyckes harkened not more to the Oracles and answers of Apollo, than we oughte to harken & gyue eare to the doctrine of this gyfte of God Christ our sauyoure.Deut. xviii. For he is that Prophet, which God promised that he would rayse vp, and put his wordes into hys mouth,Ioan. iii. so yt who so euer wyll not heare hym, God wyl

                  ix.xii. Ioan. xiiii. Titum. i. Psa. xiiii. Math. xvii. Mar. ix. Luki. ix. ii. Pt. ii. Esa. lxi. He is the waye, trueth, and lyfe. He is ye God that can not lye. He is faythefull in all hys wordes, and holye in all hys workes. We are cōmaunded of god the father to heare him. The spirite of GOD is vpon hym, he is sent to preach mery tydynges to the poore, that he myghte heale the broken in harte, preache delyueraunce to prysoners, and syghte to the blynde.Luke. iiii. Ioan. x. Ioan. viii. Esa. xlviii. He is that good shepeherd, whose voyce hys shepe heare. And euery one that is of the trueth, hearethe hys voyce. He is that Lord God, which techeth vs profitable thynges, and gouerneth vs in ye way, wherin we ought to walke. Seynge than that he is a Lorde of suche and so great authorite, excellency & puyssaunce, seyng also he teacheth nothyng but trueth, agayne seyng he hath done so much for vs, and tēdereth nothynge more

than our healthe and saluacion, we were not only to much ingrate and vnkynde towarde hym, but also very enemies vnto oure selues, yf we should not wyth all diligence apply our selues both to heare hym, and also to followe & accōplysh suche thynges as he teacheth vs. Let vs therfore hear, what he wylleth vs to do.

               Phil.
               It signifyeth not only to teache, but so to instructe, enforme, fashon▪ & teache, as scolemasters are wonte to do theyr chyldrē, whome they found & receaued rude, grosse, ignoraunt, and wythoute all good knowledge both of learnyng &

manners.Christ is our Scole master. Euen suche dyd our scolemaster and teacher Christ fynde vs, all grosse, all rude, all barbarous, al blynde, all ignorant, all vnlearned, all vnmannered and clene out of fashon. Howe coulde it otherwyse be? We were darkenesse. We walked in the vanite of our mynde, blynded in our vnderstandynge, beyng straungers from the lyfe,Ephe. v. Ephe. iiii. which is in God thorow the ignorauns, that was in vs, and the blyndenes of our hartes so that we gaue ouer our selues vnto wantonnes, to worke all manner of vnclennes wythe gredynes. For Satan the God of this worlde,ii. Cor. iiii. Esa. vi. Iohan. xii. had blynded our mindes, that we should not beleue, vnlesse the lyghte of the glorious gospell of Christ, whiche is the Image of God,Colos. i. should shyne vnto vs. But yet for all thys our rudenes, ignorauncy & blyndnes, Christ that heauenly Doctor doth not disdayne

vs. He is contented to receaue vs into hys scole, & to become oure scole master, so yt we wyll leaue our wyckednes and be contented to be reformed Oh what a gētle poynt is thys of our sauyour Iesus christ not to disdayne vs for al our rudenes & ignorācy but ioyfully to accepte vs, if we wyl follow ye trade of his scole. The comō sayeng is, an honest master loueth to haue honest seruā
                  tes. Nowe who is more honest, pure godly, innocent and 
                     •
                  autelesse, than this master Christ? It becometh thē his seruauntes to practyse & follow so nyghe as they can, his manners. Therfore the fyrst lessō that his scollers learne in his schole, is to denye vngodlynes & wordly lustes. They that entende not to do thys, they are no fyt scholers for such a scholemaster, thoughe they bragge neuer so muche of hys name, and call them

selues Christiās.Mat. vii For not euery one, sayth vnto me, Lorde, Lorde, sayth Christ, shall enter into heauen, but he that dothe the wyll of my father, which is in heauen. And I pray you marke, howe pretely and handsomely the Scripture speakethe.
               
                  That we should deny vngodlynes and worldely lustes.
As though it should saye, although in tymes paste we haue both followed and mayntened vngodlynes, ydolatry, false worshyppynges of God, supersticion, confidence in our owne selues and workes, and haue lyued after the lustes of the world and the flesh, yet now for asmuch as we are come into a newe schole, and haue another schole master & techer, which teacheth hys scholers nothyng but vertue, godlynes, and all that euer is contrary to vice, it becomethe vs

to deny, forsake, yea & vtterly to forsweare all vngodlynes and worldly lustes, and what so euer is cōtrary to the teachynge of thys oure newe scholemaster, and neuer to haue to do wt them here after, but studiously and wythe all applicacion of mynde to followe the doctrine of thys oure techer.

For the fleshe lustethe cōtrary to the spirite, and the spirite contrary to ye flesh. But they that pertayne vnto Christ, haue crucifyed the flesh with the affectes and lustes therof. If ye lyue after ye flesh ye shal dye. But if ye mortify the dedes of the body in the spirite, ye shal

lyue.Gala. v. Roma. viii▪
                   For who so euer are led wythe the spirite of God, they are the sonnes of God. Here may ye se what purenes bothe of body & mīd god requireth of vs, seīg we may not so much as once noryssh a worldely & carnall lust in our hartes. How muche lesse than, is it lawefull for vs to accomplysh them in dede, and to bryng thē forth in externall acte? Hereto pertayneth the cōmaundement, Thou shalte not couyt or lust. Our scholemaster also in the Sermon that he made in the mountayne, sayth, who so euer looketh on another mannes wyfe, lustyng after her, hath comitted adultry alredy in hys harte.Math. v▪
                   It is not wtout a cause yt Christ techeth vs to deny worldly & fleshly lustes. For if the hart be not refrayned frō euell concupiscences, & kepte cleane, it is not possible, that we can eyther speake or do, ony thynge at all that

               The Greke worde Sophronos soundethe on such manner, that to lyue soberlye, shoulde seme to be, so purely, discretely,

modestly, temperatly & lagely to institute our lyfe, that our consciēs should neuer accuse vs of ony euell, but testify wyth vs, that we lyue & do all thynges godly. He that thus lyueth, lyuethe soberly. For there is a certen sobriete so well in ye mynde as in the bodye. There is also a certen dronckēnes so well in the mynd as in the body. Lykewyse as the body is recoūted sober & in salue estate so longe as it is not distemperate wt the superfluite of meates and drynkes, so in lyke maner so long as the mynd is not troubled with vicious affectes but remayne in her natiue purite, it is recounted sober. So yt we are here taught, not only to lyue soberlye, modestly and temperately concernynge the bodye, but also the mynde. For a christen mā must haue a special respecte to ye mynde, which beyng dronken wt vices, what doth

the sobriete of the body profytte? If I kepe my bodye sober, & in neuer so good temperaunce, & my mynde be dronken wt wrathe, yre, contencion, desyre of vengeaunce, whoredome, vnclene thoughtes, and suche other carnall affectes and worldly lustes, what dothe it profyt? Therfore as ye body is to be kepte from dronkēnes, so muste the mynde be from vices. Than shall we be truly sober, & lyue well toward our selues. But for as muche as this tyme of Christmasse men vniuersally are moost of all gyuen to banckettyng, volupteous eatynge and drynkyng, so that ye christen sobriete & moderate temperaū

                  Lokīg for ye blyssed hope & apperyng of the glory of ye great God / and of oure Sauyoure Iesus Christ.
A good seruaunte nedeth not to feare his masters commynge. For in hys absence he hathe bene faythfull & diligent to do that thyng, which his master wylled him

to do. Therfore maye he lawfully euen with ioye & gladnes loke for his masters retourne. So lykewyse a christen mā, that walketh in ye waye of the Lorde, & dothe that, which he is appoynted by the lawe of God, & seaketh aboue all thinges thaccomplyshment of his masters wyll, may with a fre, glad and mery conscience looke for the commynge of Christ at the day of iudgement, which shal be terrible to the wycked, but confortable to the faythefull. And verely so many as hope to be saued at ye great day, ought so to behaue them selues in this worlde, that they maye with 
                     •
                  oye at all tymes looke for it. And they ought to be so muche the more diligent, seing the tyme is vncerten whā it shal be. Of ye dai & time, sayth Christ, knoweth no man, no not the Aungels, which are in heuē, nether the sonne hymselfe, saue only the father.

Take hede,Actum i. Mat. xxiiii xxv. Luke. xii.xix. watch, & pray, for ye know not when ye tyme is. As a man, which is gone into a straūge countrey, & hath lefte his house, and gyuen authorite to his seruauntes, and to euery man his worke, & commaunded the porter to watche. Watche therfore▪ for ye knowe not, whan the mayster of the house wyll come, whyther at euen, or at mydnyghte, whyther at the cocke crowyng, or in the dawninge, leaste yf he come sodēly should fynd you slepyng And that I say to you I saye to all, watche.
               It is to be noted, that the Scripture calleth yt a blissed hope, wherwt we hope and looke for the glorious commyng of oure Lorde & sauioure Iesus Christ vnto the iudgemente. And not wtout a cause. For althogh a Christen man be neuer so greatly vexed in thys worlde, yet whan he

casteth the eyes of hys faythe vpon that daye, and hope the that Christ shall come & gyue hym eternall glory accordynge vnto his fayth, thys maketh hym blyssed, ioyfull, quiet. & mery, and contented wyth a gladde harte, paciently and thāckefully to beare, what soeuer crosse God layeth on hys backe. We are saued thorow hope, sayth S. Paule. Derely beloued, sayth S. Iohn̄,Roma. viii. i. Ioan. iii We are now ye sonnes of God, & it hathe not yet appered what we shalbe. But we know that if he once appeare, we shall be lyke vnto him, for we shal se hym, as he is. And euery one that hath this hope in hym, purifieth hym selfe, euē as he is pure. The hoope of sayntes is ful of immortalite,Sap. iii. sayth the wyse manne. It followeth.

               At Christes commynge into thys world, he came altogyther poorely. He was borne of a poore mayd in a stable, wrapt in simple clowtes, and layd in a maunger amonge brute bestes. He was brought vp homely, lyued hardely, not hauynge where once to reast his head. All the tyme of hys lyfe he was of suche ignominy among the Byshoppes, Prestes, hed rulars, Scribes, Pharises and Saduces,Phil. ii. Math xxvii Luke. xxii. Marc. xiiii. Ioan. xviii. that at the laste they put hym vnto the moost spytefull death of the crosse, as a pestiferous malefa

                  toure, a deceyuer of the people, a techer of newe learnyng, an enemy to our mother the holy chyrche. &c. But whan he shall appeare agayne, & come vnto the iudgement, his appearyng shall be glorious, his commyng shall be royal, victorious and triumphant. He shal not come humbly

and simply, as a base person, but lyke a great and almyghty GOD, lyke a Lorde full of all puyssaunce, myghtye and power, terrible to the wycked, and amiable to the faythefull. He shall come in his glory, and all the holy aungels wyth hym,Matth. xxv thā shal he syt vpon the seat of his glory & there shall be gathered before hym all nacions. He shall shewe hymselfe to be a great God, and suche one as none is able to be cōpared vnto him It shal wel be knowne at that tyme that he was and is the true sonne of god & that very true Messias, which was promised of God by the Prophetes, what so euer the wicked Iewes saye vnto the contrary. Than shall it be manifest to al men, that ye gods of the Gentiles are dyuels, and that there is no other God, but this oure God alone.Psal. cxv Than shal they that are the aduersaries of hys trueth, & enemies

of his moost holy Gospel know howe greatly they haue erred,Sap. i.iii and .v. blasphemed ye diuine verite, persecuted his faythful seruaūtes, maintained pernicious doctrine,Math. xxv: yea than shall they receaue a reward worthy theyr wyckednes & tyranny. He shal shew hym selfe suche a great God, that it shall lyghe in his power to gyue to ye faythfull euerlastynge lyfe, & to the wycked eternall dānaciō. Oh great is the Lord & worthy very much to be praysed,Psal. cxliiii & there is no ende of hys greatnes, sayth the Psalmographe. Nedes must our Lord god be great, seyng he replenysheth bothe heauen and ear the withe the maieste of hys glory. No place is there ony where, but that hys power retchethe vnto it.Esa. lxvi. Act. vii. Heuen is my seate, & earth is my footestoole, what house wyl ye bylde for me, sayth ye Lorde? or what place is it that I should rest in: Hath not

my hande made all these thynge? But it is to be noted yt Christ is not onely called a great God, but also a sauiour ye & ye our sauiour. So yt at ye day of iudgemēt he shal not onely appere a great & myghty God to al men,Phil. iii. but also a bounteous & mercifull sauiour to the faythfull, as S. Paule witnesseth, our conuersacion is in heauen, sayth he, from whense we also looke for a sauiour, euen the Lord Iesus Christ, which shall chaū
                  ge our vile bodyes,Colos. i. that they maye be fashoned lyke vnto hys glorious body accordyng vnto the workyng, wherby he is able to subdue al thinges vnto hym selfe. Agayne, whan Christ, whiche is our lyfe, shall shew him selfe, than shal ye also appere wt him in glory. Thys great god christ is our sauiour, and not Mary, Peter, Iames, Michael, Fraūces, Dominicke, Austē, or ony other. He shal

Marcke that he saythe,

Is it not all one? Do they not tell both one tale? So se we that it is no new doctrine to say, that Christ putteth awaye all our synnes both original, actuall, veneall, mortall. &c. They that affyrme the contrary derogate not a lytle the vertue & glory of christes death, and are very they, whom S. Paule callethe,Philip. iii. the enemies of ye

These are those false Prophettes & lyeng techers, whiche, as Peter prophecied, shuld come, & priuyly bryng in dānable sectes, denyeng ye Lorde which bought them Are not they very enemies of Christes crosse, and do not they vtterly deny Christ, which teache, that Christ by hys pashyon, bloud and death did only put away but one synne? And that for those, whiche we commyt after baptisme, we oure selues must satisfy & make amēdes, so that for them there is no remissiō and forgyuenes to be asked of God the father for Iesus Christis sake?Mark well What ony other thyng is this than to make our selues equal with Christ, yea to exalt our selues aboue Christ, & to holde that oure good dedes & merites be of greater pryce & more value, than the death & bloude

of christ? For this doctrine I graūt teacheth that Christ is a sauyoure, but yet that he saueth only frō originall synne, whiche we receaued of our fyrst father Adā, so that by him we are delyuered but from one syn. It techeth agayne, that we our selues are sauiours, for asmuch as we saue our selues thorow our good dedes and merites from all those synnes, which we cōmit after baptisme Nowe lette vs se, whyther Christ be the better sauiour or we our selues & whyther there is more saluaciō in the death of Christ, or in oure good workes.

of saluacion in our workes, thā in the bloud and death of Christ: So that Christ is but a quarter sauiour and we make vp the whole. O pernicious and dyuellyshe doctrine.

beynge ether good or godly, cōmeth of God and not of hym selfe, & therfore is he worthy all prayse, honour & glory.

Is originall synne only nowe forgyuen thorowe Christ? Moreouer he saythe, yt God saueth his lyfe from destrucciō, and crowneth him in mercy and louyng kindnes. Are not these wordes playne ynough?

Nowe if Christ had putte awaye onely originall synne by hys death, thā had he not made all thinges

perfecte. For he had lefte mo synnes vnforgyuen, than were forgiuē by his deathe. Howe great and infinite is the nomber of those synnes, which we commit after baptisme in cōparison of this one originall syn? This were but a slender consummacion & makynge perfecte, so to leaue vs in mo synnes, thā we ware foūd. But Christ saueth at the ful. He maketh thē perfecte for euermore, that are sanctifyed. The vertue of Christes sacrifice is so great & of so much dignite before God the father, that it lastethe euer in full strengthe to put awaye synne, yea and that not only before, but also after baptisme.

                  ner: God setteth forthe hys loue towarde vs, in that Christ dyed for vs whan we were yet synners.Roma. v. Muche more than shall we be sauedde from wrathe by hym, seynge we are nowe made righteous thorowe his bloud. For if we were reconciled vnto god by the deathe of his sonne, whan we were yet enemies, muche more shall we be saued by hym nowe that we are reconciled. Here S. Paule proueth, yt as we are reconciled to God the father by the death of his sonne Christ, so are we also by hym saued from all wrath and displeasure that shoulde fall vpon vs. Are not these wordes playne ynoughe? At baptisme we are purged thorowe Christes bloud from originall syn & all other, that we haue committed before, so yt we are recōciled to God, & recoūted

for righteous. Nowe by Christ also are we preserued from the wrath of God, which we deserue thorowe the wyckednes, whiche we do after baptisme. Hereof than maye we gather that Christ is not only a sauiour vnto vs before, but also after baptisme. So maye we conclude, that by Christes death we are not only redemed from originall synne, but also from all other, by what so euer names they be called. Agayne he sayth it is not with the gyfte as with the synne. For if thorowe the syn of one, many be dead, yet much more plenteously came the grace and gyfte of God vpon many by the fauour that belonged vnto one mā Iesus christ. And the gyfte is not onely ouer one synne, as deathe came thorowe one synne, of one that synned. For the iudgement came of one synne vnto condemnacion, but the gyfte, to iustify

frō many synnes. Do not these wordes euidently shewe, yt by Christ we are iustifyed & made ryghteouse from many synnes? If from many synnes, than not from one synne alone. Agen to the Corinchians, fyrst of all I delyuered vnto you yt,1. Cor. xv. Esa. liii. which I also receaued, how that Christ dyed for oure synnes, accordynge to ye scriptures.Rom. v. Marke that S. Paule sayth, for our synnes, & not for oure synne, wherwithe we all offended in Adā. To the Collossians also he wryteth on this manner: By Christ we haue redēcion & by his bloud remission of sines. Note, by Christes bloud we haue remissiō of synnes, not only originall, but also actuall, mortall, veneall, &c. and not by the worckes, wich we do after baptisme as thogh it laye in oure power to fulfyll the lawe, to satisfye the wyll of God, to apease ye diuine wrath, & to obtayne

euerlastīg lyfe. For al these thynges chaunse vnto vs by Christ, & are obtayned for vs by Christes deathe, & not by ony workes or merites of mā as S. Paule sayth,Gala. ii. if righteousnes cōmeth by the lawe, thā dyed Christ in vayne. Igen, we knowe that mā is not iustifyed by the workes of the lawe,Gala. v. but by ye fayth of Iesus christ, & we beleue in Christ Iesu, that we myght be iustifyed by the faythe of Christ, & not by the workes of ye law because that no man shall be iustified by the workes of the lawe. Item, ye are gone quyte frō Christ, as many of you as wyl be made righteous by the lawe, yea ye are fallen from grace.Rom. x. Agayn in another place, they not knowynge the righteousnes of God, & labouryng to establysh theyr owne righteousnes, were not obedient to the righteousnes of God. For Christe is the perfeccion of the lawe

vnto iustificaciō for euery one that beleueth. Once agayne, if saluacion commeth of grace,Rom. xi than is it not o
                     •
                   workes, elles were grace, no grace. But if it come of worckes, than is grace nothynge. All these sentences teache vs, that we are delyuered frō all our synnes by Christ & his ryghteousnes, & not by our owne workes and deseruynges.
               Moreouer S. Paule sayth, whā ye were dead thorowe synnes,Colos. ii. Rom. v. Ephe. ii. & the vncircūcision of the flesh, God quickened you with christ, & forgaue vs all our synnes, & put out the handewrytyng, that was agaynst vs contayned in the lawe wrytten, & that hath he taken oute of the waye,Gen. iii. Luke. xi. Ioan. xii. and fastened it to the crosse, & hath spoyled rule and power, and hath made a shewe of them openly, & triumphed ouer them in hys owne person.

thorow christ, sayth S. Paule here. Where is ony excepcion? If there be mo synnes, than the originall synne as there are, them also hath God the father forgyuen vs thorowe Iesus Christ oure Lorde.Heb. i. To the Hebrues agayne he wrytethe, Christe in hys owne parson pourged our synnes, & is set on the righte hande of the maiestye on hygh. Frō our synnes hath Christ made vs clene, and not from one synne onely.Heb. ix. Christ was offered once for all to take away the synne of many.

But this our hed preste Christ hath offered but one sacrifice, not for the originall synne only, but for synnes sayth he, & yet is it of so great vertu and strength, that it is of value for euer, the power of it neuer decayeth it abydeth in full strength

                   so longe as ony synne remayneth, so that it nedeth not oftē tymes to be offered, as the sacrifices of ye old lawe were.

For withe this one sacrifice, whiche was the oblacion of hys body, hathe he made them for euer so perfecte, ye are sanctifyed, that they nede none other sacrifice to make them holy & acceptable in the syghte of God. All that haue had theyr synnes forgyuē thē from the beginnyng of ye worlde vntyll this daye, or shall haue vnto the ende of the world, haue had, and shall haue all theyr synnes forgyuē thē thorowe this one sacrifice of Iesus Christ.

               Hys sayēges proue manifestly, yt we are redemed by Christ not only from originall synne, but also from all other▪
               
            
            
               Philemon.
               You say truth. Wel ye shal heare now ye myndes of the other Apostles. S. Peter sayth,i. Pet. ii. Esa. liii. christ his owne selfe bare our synnes in his body on the tree, that we beynge delyuered from synnes, shuld lyue vnto righteousnes. Note how Peter agreeth in euery poynt with hys fellowe Paule. He styffely affyrmeth that christ his owne selfe, and none other, bare our synnes in his bodye, & not our originall synne alone. By his strypes we were made so whole, that there remayned not so muche as a scarre of all our sores, botches & woundes.i: Ioan. i. S. Iohn̄ also sayth, the bloud of Iesus Christ maketh vs thorowly cleane, yea & tha
                     •
                  
                  
from all synne. Can ony thynge be spokē more generally? If the bloude of Iesus christ maketh vs clene frō al syn, what remayneth ther behynde, I praye you? So followethe it that both the synne originall, actuall, mortal, veneall, & what not, is washed awaye by Christes bloude. Agayne, if we confesse oure synnes, God is faythfull and ryghteous to forgiue vs our synnes, and to make vs cleane from all wickednes. This one texte alone of S. Iohn̄ is able to subuerte, ouertople and throwe downe all the byldynge, shores and proppes, wherwithe these sleyghtye daubers vpholde theyr enterprises. If we confesse our synnes, sayth he. If which we? if we that professe the christen religiō, and yet thorow our fragilite and weakenesse of nature haue offended God after oure baptisme contrary to our vow and promyse

made thereat, if we, I saye after that we haue fallen, confesse our synnes, God is faythfull and ryghteoꝰ, what to do? to forgyue vs our synnes. Note our synnes, & to make vs cleane from all vnrighteousnes: What synne is it than, I praye you from the whiche he dothe not make vs clene? This sentence must nedes be vnderstonde of thē, which offende after baptisme. Nowe sayth s. Iohn̄ although we synne after baptisme, yet lette vs not dispayre, but rather repent, bewayle our synfull lyuyng detest our wycked manners, turne vnto God, & cōfesse our synnes vnto hym. If we do this, doubt we not but ye God, which is faythfull in performyng his promyse (he hathe promised them that come vnto hym wt a faythfull and repentaūt harte, remissiō of theyr synnes) & ryghteous in forgyuyng the penitent & sorowfull

synner, & in condemnynge the wycked, which continewe in his vngodlines wythout ony confession of his faulte and amendement of lyfe, wyll forgyue vs oure synnes, yea & make vs clene from all vnrighteousnes. These wordes proue manifestly, that God forgyueth oure synnes after baptisme, if we repent, cōfesse, and amende. Wherof comethe this? of the merites of our workes, or rather of the free grace & mere mercye of God, purchased for vs by Iesus Christ, for whose sake the wrathe of God the father is pacified, and he is wel pleased & fully contented wt mā? Uerely for Christes sake dothe God shew to vs this excedīg & great mercy in forgiuyng vs our synnes, whē so euer we call vnto hym, wi
                     •
                  h a contrite & sorowfull harte,i. Ioan. ii. as S. Iohn̄ proueth by the wordes that follow: My lytle childrē, I wryte these thinges

vnto you, yt ye should not synne. And if ony man synne, we haue an aduocate wythe the father, Iesus Christ that ryghteous one. And he is that sacrifice, which apeaseth goddes wrath & satisfyeth (so soundethe the Greke word Hilasmos) for our synnes, not for our synnes only, but for al ye worldes. As though he shuld say: My lytle chyldrē, I haue declared vnto you, that although we syn after baptisme contrary to our professiō, yet that ther is grace, fauour, mercy, & forgyuenes of synnes layd vp for vs in store, if that we repent, cōfesse our faultes, & entend vnfaynedly to amende our lyues. I haue not done thys to engraffe in you a vayne hoope, & to encourage you to haue ye more plesure & to remayne ī your olde wyckednes, but I wryte these thynges vnto you, yt ye should not synne. I haue set forth the kyndnes

of God towarde you, yt ye shulde endeuour youre selues to lyue worthy of it. But for asmuch as there lyueth no man in thys world, whyche synneth not, & seynge we canne not walke so purely, but yt at sometyme we must nedes fall, therfore because ye shoulde not dispayre, but be assuredly persuaded, that there remayneth health for you wyth the Lorde god: I certefy you, that we haue one which is our aduocate wyth the father, which pleateth our matter before the throne of the diuine maieste whiche is ready to healpe vs, whiche ceaseth not makyng intercession for vs, vntyll he be hearde, and this is, not such one, as hath also offended, but Iesꝰ christ yt righteoꝰ one, which is godly innocent, vndefyled, pure, clene, fautles, immaculate, & so wt
                  out all spotte of vice, that euen for his owne dignite, worthynes & innocēcy,

he is worthy to obtayne what so euer he asketh. And I saye moreouer v
                     •
                  to you, yt not our owne workes, nor ye merites of other, but that righteous one Christ, is that verye sacrifice, which apeseth Gods wrath whome we haue prouoked vnto anger wyth the synnes, whiche we do comitte after Baptisme, and satisfyeth for oure synnes. Yea he makteh not only a sufficient & plenteous amendes for our synnes, but also for all ye whole worldes, I mean so many as repent them of ther wicked liuing, confesse ther fautes, beleue, desyre forgyuenes, and laboure to leade a newe lyfe, what wyll we haue more? Doth not S. Iohn̄ declare here euidently yt oure synnes, whā so euer they be cōmitted or done are forgyuē vs of god thorow Iesꝰ Christ, which is oure aduocate, and that sacrifice, whyche apeaseth god

the fathers wrath, & plenteously satisfyeth for our synnes? So doth it than manifestly appeare, that christ hath not only redemed vs & satisfyed to God ye father for originall syn, but also frō al other. But let vs yet heare more,i. Ioan. ii. what he sayth. I wryte vnto you lytle chyldren, that youre synnes are forgyuen for hys names sake. Ergo our synnes, and not one synne alone, are forgyuē vs, not for our owne workes & merites, but for Christes name, that is to saye, for ye dignite, worthynes, excellency, merites and deseruynges of Christ.i. Ioan. iiii. Agē, In thys thynge appeared the loue of God towarde vs, that he sent his only begotten sonne into the world that we shoulde lyue thorowe hym. In thys is loue, not that we loued God, but that he loued vs, and sent his sonne to be a sacrifice both to appease hys wrathe and to satisfye for

our sīnes. what do I? Paper, yncke penne, and tyme shall fyrst want vnto me, than I shall may be able to reherse all the testimonies, wherwith it is euidentely proued, that Christ hath not only by his moost blyssed & precious bloud redemed vs frō originall syn, as some wickedly dreame but also from all other, by what so euer name they be called, the synne of the holye Ghoste excepted, & that whan so euer we repent, beleue and amende God the father forgyuethe vs also those synnes, whiche we commit after baptisme, not for our own dedes,Deut. iiii. Heb. xiii. Iob. xxxvii. workes and merites, whiche be more vnpure, than they maye be able to stonde in the syghte of God, which is a consumyng fyre, a ielous God, great in strength, iudgemente and righteousnes, and with whome there is none innocente, but for the swete smellyng sacrifyce, which Iesus

Christ his welbeloued sonne offered for our synnes vpō the altare of the crosse once for all,Exo. xxxiiii. Ephe. v Heb. ix.x. whose vertu and strength abydeth so perfecte for euermore, that by it the sinnes of so many as with a truly faythfull and repentaunte harte come vnto God, are forgyuen, forgotten, and neuermore remembred. And thus se you that Christ is a perfecte Sauiour, whiche, as youre newe yeares gyfte sayth, hath by his bloud redemed vs from all vnrighteousnes, that is to saye, from all synne both originall, actuall,Actum. iiii. mortall, veneall. &c. yea and yt not onely before but also after baptisme. So that as S. Peter sayth, there is saluaciō in none other, but only ī Christ Iesus. Nether is ther ony other name gyuē to men vnder heauen, wherin we muste be saued.

               Wel, thus haue ye hearde grossely and rudely, but yet faythfully and truly vttered of me, what the holye scriptures do determyne concernynge the remission of synnes by Christ, and that by hym we are not only delyuered from originall syn, as some wickedly dreame but also from all other, by what soeuer name they be called. Nowe because ye shal not thyncke yt I wreste

the scriptures, whome all mē ought to handle reuerently and incorruptly, I wyll rehearse a sayenge or two vnto you of the Doctors.Lib. ii. cap. viii. Hylichius sayth: Not one synne only, but many are forgiuen vs thorow the sacrifice of Christ, whiche is the onely begotten sonne of God. If not one syn only, but many are forgiuen vs thorowe the sacrifice of Christ, it followeth than that by Christes deathe we are not only redemed from originall synne, but also from all other. Hereto agreeth the sayeng of saynt Ambrose, The grace of God thorow Christ hath iustifyed men not from one synne alone,In Rom. cap. v. but from many, by gyuynge them remission of synnes. Not from one synne only, sayth S. Ambrose, hath God of his grace thorowe Christ iustified, and made vs ryghteous, but from many, by gyuyng vs remission of synnes. Nowe

gather who luste. The wordes are playne ynough. But I wyll reherse S. Austen, one of the best amonge ye auncient Doctors, and moost faythfull expositour of ye holy scriptures. S. Austen wrytyng agaynst ye Pelagians & Manicheys,Ad hilari

And what is it to say, from many faultes to iustificacion, but that the grace of Christ hath not onlye loosoned that fault, wherwith infantes be boūde, which hadde theyr begynnyng of that one man, but also many faultes, whiche after ye men come to age, they adde and put vnto it thorowe theyr euell manners. Here sayth saynt Austen playnly, that the grace of christ hath not only losoned, delyuered & made vs free from originall synne, wherwyth we all offended in Adam, but

also from all other, which we afterwarde commit, as we growe in age. I could rehearse many mo authorities both of this Doctor and other, whiche maynly fortify this matter, but because I wyll not be tedious vnto you, I let them passe, trusting that with these aforsayd ye are fully satisfyed.

               Although this vngodly doctrine be raised vp now agen in this our tyme of the Anabaptistes, yet hath it had alwayes fautoures and maynteners longe before our dayes, in somuche as we rede, that a certen man called Peter Abelharde was counted for an Heretyke and compelled of saynt Bernarde to recant in the councell of Senon▪ because he taught this & suche lyke thynges. If hys doctrine had bene godly and agreable to the

holy scriptures, he had neuer ben so handeled. Alas good neyghboures, what are we of our selues, yt we dare so depresse and thrust downe ye death of Christ, and so to exalte our selues that he by his pashon sauyng vs frō one synne, we shuld presume to saue our selues by our owne workes and merites from many?

As towchyng the righteusnes, whiche is in the lawe, no man could once rebuke me,Philip. iii Actum. ix. Gala. i. sayth S. Paul. But those thynges, which were vauntage vnto me, I counted losse for Christes sake Yea moreouer I thyncke all thynges but losse for the excellencye

of the knowledge of Christ Iesu my Lorde, for whome I haue counted all thynges losse, and do iudge them but dounge, that I myghte wynne Christ, & be foūd in hym, not hauing myne own ryghteousenesse, whyche cometh of the lawe, but that, which is by the fayth of Christ, namely the righteousnes, whych cometh of god in fayth, to knowe hym and the vertue of his resurrecciō and the felowshyp of his pashon.

How lytle estemeth he his own goodnes, so that he may knowe the vertue of Christes resurreccion, and the felowshyp of his pashon. All Paules delectacion & pleasure is in Christ & in christes death,

perfecte, & abundantly good in all thynges. Furthermore saynt Iohn̄ sayth, if we say, that we haue fellowshyp with Christ,i. Ioan. i. & yet walke in darknes, we lye & do not ye trueth But if we walke in the lyght, as he is in the lyght, we haue felloweshyp one wyth another, and the bloud of Iesus Christ gods owne sonne, maketh vs cleane from all synne. This texte prouethe manifestly that we haue no feloweshyp wythe Christ, so long as we walke in darkenes, that is, in synfull lyuynge, agayne, that the bloude of Christe profytethe vs nothyng at all, excepte we walke in the lyght of Gods worde, & laboure to fulfyll hys holye preceptes. For, sayth S. Iohn̄,i. Ioan. ii. by this do we know yt we haue known hī, if we kepe hys cōmaūdemētes. He yt sayth, I know hī, & kepeth not hys cōmaūdemētes is a lyare, and the truethe is not in

hym, But he that dothe hys worde, trulye in hym is the loue of God perfecte. By this do we knowe that we are in hym. He that sayth, he abydeth in hym, oughte to walke, euen as he walked. Of this & all the other textes, which I haue hitherto rehearsed, we may easly learne, what is our duty and howe earnestly we oughte to seake occasions for to do good. Seyng we are ye peopeople of God, yea hys peculiare & oute chosen people, we muste nedes shewe oure selues earnest followers of good workes, or elles haue we no fellowshyp wyth Christ. God the father is not oure father, nether are we christes brothers, nor yet fellow heyres wyth hym, if we seake not to lead a godly and vertuous lyfe. Let vs neuer crake of the iustificaciō of fayth, of ye fre mercy of God, of christes pashō, bloud, death, merites, &c.

we lead a lyfe worthy the kyndenes of God. Lette vs neuer reioyse that we are delyuered from the power of Satā, synne, deth, & hell, for so long as we cōtinue in our olde synnefull lyuynge and wycked manners, we pertayne not vnto Christ, but are ye bonde slaues of Satan, & very fyre brondes of hell.
