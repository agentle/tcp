            Partem Parentes
TO THE RIGHT
Worſhipfull and vertuous
Lady, the Lady Anne Bacon, ſole
heire to the Worſhip. Edward Buttes
Eſquire, her Father, as alſo to her Ʋncles,
the right worthie Syr William
Buttes Knight, and
Thomas Buttes Eſquire,
deceaſed.
            The Name of this Booke.
            
               A Painter (Right
worſhipfull) fain
woulde make a
ſpeech to great
Alexander, and
(for that being a
meane man, and
vnknowne to the King, ſmall notice
and leſſe reſpect would bee had of

him) he procured Alexanders owne
cloake or princely robe, and therein
preſented himſelfe before the King.
The ſame deuiſe my ſelfe am forced
to put in practiſe, for being vnworthie,
or at leaſt not knowne worthie
to be knowne vnto your Ladiſhip,
I do partly cloake me with the large
Mantle of common Homage: partly
cloath me with the proper coate
of my Anceſtors: who as they were
a litle nearer then my ſelf vnto your
blood, ſo were they much nearer to
your thoughts, and better knowne
vnto you. Thus hauing put on my
cloake with the Painter, I begin my
ſpeech.
            Madame, as the admired perfection
of all excellent indowments,
wherewith God hath inriched you,
neceſſarily plucketh from the hearts
of all that know you, due reuerence;
ſo the naturall league of mutual loue
and friudſhip betweene your and

my Anceſtors, (while they all liued
togither in Norffolke) more neerly
vrgeth mee particularly to deuote
my ſelfe vnto you. And yet not only
your Ladiſhips proper name (now
cancelled and concealed in you, by
participation of another) is thus powerfull
to commaund my thoughts;
but infinit cauſe (me thinkes) I haue,
highly to reſpect and honour you,
euen in, & by that name, which (but
for my fathers progeny ſtil continuing
in Norffolk) had put our name to
ſilence. Yea, who moſt gladly honoureth
not the glorious name of
that thriſe worthie and renowmed
wight of famous memory, Syr Nicholas
Bacon, Lord Keeper of the
great ſeale of England, while he liued:
whoſe magnificent bountie to
our Vniuerſitie, and eſpecially to
Corpus Chriſti Colledge (whereof
himſelf ſometime was, as I am now)
hath purchaſed him a perpetuitie of

glory, to be celebrated for euer a
principall Benefactor. The chiefe
Ofspring from this ſo excellent a
roote (into whom the whole acoompliſhment
of all that worth is tranſfuſed
and deriued) is your Ladiſhips
rightly right Worſhipfull Knight,
of the ſame name, now liuing. Who
is wel knowne to be the vndoubted
heire, not only of his fathers wealth,
but of his vertues and glory alſo. All
theſe premiſed words (excellent Lady)
inferre thus much: I moſt willingly
acknowledge, either of you
both may iuſtly claime intereſt in
the Fee-ſimple (or rather ſimple fee)
of my beſt indeuours, ſtudies and
praiers, for the preſeruation of your
health, and continuance of your life.
The which leaſt I ſhould ſeeme only
idlely to wiſh, I haue not onely
bene Votary to Aeſculapius, Phiſickes
great Grand-father, but Seruant
alſo to Dyet, healths kindeſt

Nourſe. To whoſe frugall Table, I
inuite your Ladiſhip.
            But afore you come, I think it my
beſt courſe to tell you what kind a
feaſt you ſhall finde. In three words
I deſcribe it thus: Dyets dry Dinner.
That is, varietie of Fare: prouided,
prepared and ordered, at Dyets own
preſcription: whoſe ſeruant and Attendant
at this feaſt I profeſſe my
ſelfe. Thus far (perhaps) not diſliked
of any. A Dry Dinner, not only Camnum
Prandium, without Wine, but
Accipitrinum, without all drinke except
Tabacco, (which alſo is but Dry
Drinke): herein not like to be liked
of many. What ere it be (as he ſaith
in the Comedie) Habeas vt Nacta,
take it as you finde it, and welcome.
More then which I cannot perform.
And therefore moſt humbly I kiſſe
your hand.
            
               Your Ladiſhips moſt deuoted.
Henry Buttes.
            
         
         
            
            
            Partem Amici
TO MY WORSHIPfull
and eſpeciall friends,
Richard Thekeſton Eſquire,
and Elynor
his Wife.
            The cotall Mehod.
            
               IT is a dignitie in
actiue Nature,
(Right worſhipfull)
that Agens
agit, vt aſſimulet
ſibi Patiēs:
that is, to make
the paſſiue likewiſe
actiue. It were an eaſie (though
a tedious) taske, to note in euery one of
Natures actions, Re-action. But that

great labour may be greatly leſſened by
arguing A Minoie: by inſtance of the
leſſe actiue Eliments. For who ſeeth not
(but he that doth not ſee) that he ſeeth
his own face in the water, no otherwiſe,
then by reference of the offered ſhape or
ſpecies of his obiect countenance? Nay
the moſt (if not meerely) paſſiue Earth
returneth notwithſtanding, euen to the
middle ayre, thoſe ſplendent beames
which formerly the Sunne conferred on
it. If the ſenceleſſe and lifeleſſe Eliments
can thus react it, then reaſonable
man, hath much more reaſon to be
conformable vnto thoſe that worke his
good. We to whom your Worſhips exhibite
your bountie, are thoſe ſame waters
on which the wiſe Salomon biddeth
you caſt your bread; in whom you ſee
your faces, the ſhape and Image of your
ſelues: for we are alſo men as yee be.
Then (according to your worſhips wonted
affabilitie) graciouſly embrace that
conformable reaction, which your owne
moſt hounteous fauours haue begotten

in me. I haue bene paſſing deſirous ſome
way to intimate vnto your worſhips, that
I am not ſenſeles or vnmindfull, though
vnworthy of your kindneſſes. And therfore
finding my ſelfe vnable to requite
your greater fauours. Quod quimui
quando quod volumus, non. In Item
of that great good cheare I haue often
bad with you, both at London and in
Yorke-ſhire, I do ſemblably inuite you
both to a Schollers Dinner. But where,
or whither, I may not (for I cannot) tell
you. Your Worſhip Sir, well remembreth
that ſolemne inuitation at Cambridge,
in Veſperijs Comitiorum;
and therefore will eaſily let paſſe this
fallacian without Elench or reprehenſion.
Neither can I hope for, at either of
your hands, any vngentle or diſcourteous
cenſure. It is an other kind of gueſt,
an vnkinde gueſt, vnbiaden, and as bold
as welcome, whom my minde preſageth,
ſome Gentleman, Sewer to ſome
certaine Gentlewoman Semſter, who
more nice then wiſe, picketh a quarell
with the order, or diſorder rather (as

he weeneth) of my Dinner; ſtoutly auerring
him that ſcrued in the courſes,
to be both ignorant of faſhions, and void
of all good cuſtomes. What? (quoth he)
Fruite in the firſt courſe? Then Fleſh,
Fiſh, White-meates, and at laſt come in
ſalt and ſpoones, ſpice and ſauce, when
all the meate is eaten? Nay more? Tabacco
after all, vpon a full ſtomack. Fie,
fie: Dyets Dinner? a moſt groſſe abſurd,
and prepoſterous banquet. May
it pleaſe your Worſhips, this challenge
muſt of force be anſwered. Therefore in
vſhering theſe my ſeruices, I profeſſe
my ſelfe a verie preuaricatour of this
Ages faſhion: and do follow the order
of vniuerſall time, by conſequence and
ſucceſſion.
            
               FruitesThus much all we know, our grand
parents at firſt ſed on the fruites of Ede
                     •
                  .
and ſome merrily ſay, Adam robbed
Gods Orch-yard.
            
               Hearbes.
               
                  〈◊〉
                
               
                  •
               fter their exitement, they fell to
Hearbes and Rootes, and (as ſeculer

                  〈◊〉
                witneſieth) we liued a long time
(like H
                  •
               g
                  •
               es) with Maſt or Accornes,

till age taught Tillage.
            
               Fleſh.But all either could not or would not
be husbandmen, therefore ſome went
forth on hūting, ſome at home kept ſheep
and cattle: ſo came we to finde ſauour
in Fleſh Which (probably) we did long
afore we taſted Fiſh,Fiſh. ſince of the two,
Fleſh is more obuious & eaſie to be had.
As alſo Fiſh by good reaſon preuēted
white-meates, for the ſimple is afore the
Compound, and the Naturall afore the
Artificiall.
            
               White-meates.Therefore after Fiſh follow White-meates,
requiring the helpe of art, and
bumane inuention in tract of time.
            
               Spice.Neither did our infinit appetite here
conſiſt contented with things neceſſary,
but ſomething yet was wanting to adde
voluptuous delight. Wherefore wanton
appetite growing weary of Natures
bare and ſimple Ordinary, gan glycurouſly
to banquet with all ſorts of Spices
and Aromatique delicates.
            
               S
                     •
                  uſe.But eating Honny with a Ladle, it
was ſoone cloyed with the exceſſe of
ſweetneſſe: ſo that tart Condiments &
ſauces, ſeemed requiſite to prouoke and
reuoke loathing and loſt appetite.
            
               
               Tabacco.
Thus proceded wee by degrees, from
ſimplicitie and neceſſitie, to varietie and
plentie, ending in luxury and ſuperfluitie.
So that at laſt our bodies by ſurfeeding,
being ouerflowne and drowned (as
it were) in a ſurpluriſie or deluge of
a ſuperfluous rawe humour, (commonly
called Rheume) we were to be anheled
(like newe dampiſh Ouens, or olde
dwelling houſes that haue ſtood long deſolate).
Hence is it that we perfume
and aire our bodies with Tabacco
ſmoake (by drying) preſeruing them
from putrifation.
            May your Worſhips be fully ſatisfied
with this reaſon of my extraordinary
Dry Dinner (to whom both it and my
ſelf are purpoſely deuoted) the firſt diſh
of it (I meane a Figge) for the reſt.
            
               Ʋntil I haue in readineſſe ſome other
matter more worthie your countenance
and Patronage, I moſt humbly take my
leaue.
            
               Your Worſhips Scholler,
H. Buttes.

To my Country-men
Readers.
            The partiall Method.
            
               WElcome courteous
Countrey-men.
I meane
eſpecially Norfolkmē. For they
are true Catholiques
in matter
of Dyet: no
Recuſants of any thing that is mans
meate. I bid all in general, excepting
only ſuch as are affrayed of roaſted
Pigge, a breaſt or legge of Mutton,
a Ducke &c. To conclude, I forbid
no man, but him onely that

hath maried a wife & cannot come.
No man ſhall looſe his labour. Here
are Lettuſes for euery mans lips. For
the Northeren-man, White-meates,
Beefe, Mutton, Veniſon: for the Southerne
man, Fruites, Hearbes, Fowle,
Fiſh, Spice, and Sauce. As for the
Middle-ſex or Londoner, I ſmell his
Diet. Veſcitur aura aetheria. Here is
a Pipe of right Trinidado for him.
The Yorkers they will bee content
with bald Tabacodocko. What ſhould
I ſay? here is good Veale for the Eſſex-man:
paſſing Leekes and excellent
Cheeſe for the Welſh-man. Denique
quid non? Mary, here are neither
Eg-pies for the Lancaſhire-man,
nor Wag-tayles for the Kentiſh-man.
But that is all one here is other good
cheere enough. And what is wanting
in meate, ſhall bee ſupplyed in
kinde welcome and officious attendance.
            Leaſt any thing ſhould be amiſſe,
or miſſing to thee, I haue my ſelfe

(for fault of a better) taken vpon me
all ſuch Offices as any way concerne
this Dinner.
            
            
               1 Choiſe.Firſt, I am Cator: and haue prouided
the very choiſe of ſuch daynties

               2 Vſe.Secondly, I am Taſter: commending
each diſh to thy Palate, according
to his right vſe and vertue. 3 Hurt.And
(ſince nothing is ſo perfectly good,
as it partaketh no euill property) I
haue put into a by-diſh (like Egſhelles
in an Saucer) what worthily
may breed offence. Herein imitating
a merry Greeke, who eſpying an
haire in a diſh of Butter, called for
another diſh and diſhed it by it ſelf.
            
               4 Preparatī
                  on, or Correction.Thirdly, I play the Cooke: ſo preparing,
ſeaſoning, and ſaucing the
harmefull diſpoſition of euery meat,
as it ſhall be either in whole aboliſhed,
or in part qualified.
            Laſtly, I aſſume the Caruers Office:
and hauing noted the nature
and operation of each particular diſpenſe

to euery of my Gueſts according
to the Seaſon,Degree. Seaſon. Age. Conſtitution. his Age, and
Conſtitution.
            Thus very rudely, I obtrude vnto
thee not a banquet, but a byt rather
of each diſh Scholler-likely, that is,
badly carued. For Schollers are bad
Caruers. Do thou, by thy kindly feeding
on Dyets dry Dinner, but cauſe
thy ſelfe to thirſt for Dyets Drinking:
and I ſhall with like alacrity, act
thy Cup-bearer. Wherefore vntill
thou beeſt Dry drunke, Fare-well.

there with manifeſt diſtance.

finde it deſcribed by the Italian
Freitagio. The Italian (as all the

Condiments, they being indeede
the better part of his Diet. All

               A Satyricall Epigram, vpon

               IT chaunc'd me gazing at the Theater,
               To ſpie a Lock-Tabacco-Chevalier,
               Clowding the loathing ayr with foggie fume
               Of Dock-Tabacco, friendly foe to rume.

               I gan this wize bespeak my gallant Sir:
               Certes, me thinketh (Sir.) it ill beſeems,
               Thus hereto vapour out theſe reeking ſteams:
               Like or to Maroes ſteeds, whoſe noſthrils flam'd;
               Or Plinies Noſemen (mouthles men) ſurnam'd,
               Whoſe breathing noſe ſupply'd Mouths abſency.
               He me regreets with this prophane reply:
               Nay; I reſemble (Sir) Iehouah dread,
               From out whoſe noſthrils a ſmoake iſſued:
               Or the mid-ayrs tongealed region,
               Whoſe ſtomach with crude humors frozenon
               Sucks vp Tabacco-like the vpmoſt ayr,
               Enkindled by Fires neighbour candle fayr:
               
                  
And hence it ſpits out watry reums amaine,
               As phleamy ſnow, and haile, and ſheerer raine:
               Anon it ſmoakes beneath, it flames anon.
               Sooth then, quoth I, it's ſafeſt we be gon,
               Lest there ariſe ſome Ignis Fatuus

               The Name in India is Pilciet,
ſurnamed Tabacco by the Spaniards,
of the Ile Tabaco. By their

but yet wee are not beholden to

               Thus much late Hiſtories tell vs: among the
Indians it is ſo highly honoured, that when the
Prieſts are conſulting in matter of importance,
they preſently caſt Tabacco into the fire, and receiue
at their noſe & mouth, the ſmoak through
a Cane, till they fall downe dead-drunke. Afterward
reuiuing againe, they giue anſweres according
to the phantaſmes and viſions, which
appeared to them in their ſleepe.
