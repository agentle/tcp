               Nowel, Deane of Paules.
            
               THe fatherlye and faithfull maner of your diuine Doctrine (M. Deane,) with the blotlesse life you lead (soū
               ded by the vniuersal report of good people) made mee often desirous to dedicate some labour of mine, to the protectiō of your sound iudgement. And now pricked forward by Gods mightie motion (and maruellous workes of late) to bestowe a fewe verses to a vertuous personage, in a vitious world & dangerous season, I haue chosen you among a multitude, to sounde out the trumpet of Gods glorie, and to giue passage to the playnesse of my pen, and willing paines I haue taken: Not as though my wordes or inuention (voide of depe profundity) might aduance any waye the high maiestie of God, or further the good Fame you haue gotten. But being in humility of minde, loking to the basenesse of this world, and meannes of my

calling, (vnfurnished both of heauenly gifts & worldly good fortunes) I presumed thorow my pen and studie, to purchase you a friend, and reclaime the enimies of God to come home to their consciences, and looke on the wonders of the Lorde, that dayly is working amōg his louing people. So neyther meaning to flatter (where tender eares can abyde no doublenesse) nor stretche out a bare Epistle, with a long discourse of borrowed wordes, I betake you to the almightie, committing that followes (this simple short Scedule) to the great and good consideration of your Wisdome. From my lodging this eight of April. Your wel willer alwayes at commaundement.

            ¶ Churchyardes admonition to the Reader.
            
               I Trust (good Reader) that the fresh memorie of this late woonder shall make thée to looke backe-warde vnto thy former faultes, and make thée a new man, i
                  •…
                cleannesse of life. For the straunger the things are that our eyes behold, the more the impression of the minde is carnestly occupied about the vnderstanding of a wonder. And ye oftener we sée maruelles, the more is Gods might made manifest, & we the more affrayed to offend. But perhaps, some fine headed fellowes will wrest (by naturall argumentes) Gods doing and works, to a worldly or earthly operation▪ procéeding from a hidden cause in the body and bowels of ye earth. As in déede of many other earthquakes before, hath bene written and throughly disputed: A reason that man

maketh, and a matter to be spokē of, but not much to be cōmended. Let such fine wittes search out secretes, and sift what they can from the bottome of their senses. Yet those that feare God, (and féele in their consciences a diuine motion frō the consideration of worldly wonders) will take the Earthquake to be of a nother kinde of Nature: And beholding y• myraculous manner of the same, with open armes, and humble heart, will embrace Gods visitation, & worthily welcome the messanger he sendeth. Which assuredly cannot come, without his prouidence, nor be séen without his heauenly will and pleasure. And this is much to be noted: If naturall causes onely compelled such Earthquaks (and procured such tremblings,) then aswell in the wilde fieldes, as in the ciuill Townes, these alterations were often to be foūd. In déede many graue Auctors write, how mightie mountaines haue bene remoued, & whole Countreys haue bene drowned, by y• occasion of Earthquaks. But in those kingdomes, the Lorde of al Kinges (for some hidden iudgement to

himselfe) bore a greater sway in those causes and places, than any other natural properties. And though that in many territories & open fieldes (as good bookes make report) Earthquakes haue bene séene, and great hurt hath bene done: yet the harmes that come by Earthquakes in a ciuill towne (where God is honored and taketh care of his people) argues a maruellous mysterie, and perswades a further matter, than weake witted men may meddle withall. For sundry Cities haue soonk, & millions of Houses, Churches, Towres, and walles, haue bene by Earthquake vtterly ouerthrowen. But commonly such wonders are séen, where all the world may be a witnesse of Gods great glory: and mans vnsuretie of life may be thorowly vnderstoode. Now if for all things that sodenly happen, a reason may be made, and naturall argumentes leade mans beléefe from the hope, feare, & confidence in God, then though thousandes of wonders happened in a day, not one among ten thousād would thinke that God doth any thing at al, but as natural causes do fal out, 
                  •…
               h thing to haue

both beginning and their end. God kéepe his chosen from such a conceit of chance, and beléefe of blindnesse. But now to be plaine, no threatning serueth a naughtie seruaunt, No whippe, nor rod, amendeth a loytering scholler, nor no example may reforme a filthie liuer. For whē ye plague is past, the people fall to pleasure. And euen as a horse forgets the spurre, & falles to a i

               nbeling pace, immediatly after his gentle remembrance: so man thinkes no longer on a wonder than a dreame, and makes no more accompt of a meruaile, than if a trifle had bene tolde him. Yet my hope is (good Reader) that the wise will be warned, and the well disposed person will be the better, while he liueth, as oft as this late Earthquake shal come to his minde and memorie. For it was maruelous in the sight of man, & a great thing (no doubt) before the face of the Almightie: to whom be praise and glory for euer.
         
      
      
         
            
            ¶ The reporte of the saide Earthquake, howe it beganne.
            
               ON Wednesdaye in the Easter wéeke, beyng the sixt day of April. 1580. betwene the houres of fiue and sixe in the euening, hapned generally through all the City of London, & the Suburbes of the same (as it were in a moment and vppon the sodaine) a wonderful motion and trembling of the earth, in somuch, as Churches, Pallaces, Houses, and other buildings did so quiuer and shake, that such as were then present in the same were tossed too and fro as they stoode, and others, as they sate on seates, driuen off from their places: some leaning backewardes, were readye to fall: and manye besides so shaken standing, that it broughte suche terror to those that were in the same houses, that the most part feared, their houses woulde come downe

vpon them, and therevppon ranne oute of their doores in greate pe

               plexitie, to sée whether their houses were stil standing in their wonted place or no. And some houses did so crackle, that the tables and stooles, with other furniture, as Bra
                  •…
               e and Pewter, so tottered, that it was thought they would haue fallen to the ground, and the houses reste insunder. And this chaunced not only in London (& ye suburbs of ye same) but also in diuers other parts through the nerest places of our knowlege in Englād. But specially about S. Katherins, the Limehouse, & Rad
                  •…
               liffe, where y• people were so maruellously amazed, y• it was pitifull to beholde how fearefully they ranne oute of their doores, and howe strangely one would beholde an other, thinking verilye, that the latter daye hadde bene come. And the houses on London bridge didde shake euen in the same sort as in other parts of y• Citie. Whereby it appeareth, that the sayd trembling and mouing of the earth, did not onely passe vnder the houses on the firme ground, but also vnder the riuers

and waters. And to signifie better the generalitie of the same, you shal vnderstād, that the Abbey Church at Westminster, was there with so shaken, that one of the Pinacles of the same, loste aboue one foote of his toppe, the stones whereof fel to the ground. Also the stéeple in the Pallace so shoke, that the bel of the great Clocke sounded therewith, as thoughe it hadde bene stricken with some hā

The new Hall of the middle Tēple did so shake also, as it caused a number of Gentlemē (being set to Supper) to roon forth with their kniues in their hands, fearing that it woulde fall. It chanced also, Tho. Cobhed being in y• pulpit in Christes church in Newgate market, preaching to y• people, sodenly ye church so shooke, ye out of the roofe of the same fell certayne greate stones, by the fall whereof, a boy named Thomas Gray, apprentice to Iohn Spurling Shoomaker, was brayned, and Mabell Eueret
               
his fellowe seruaunt, was stricken on the heade with a stone, being daungerously hurt, but is not dead: and a number of the people (by hasting to flee and scape away) were sore brused and hurt, by falles and suche like a

                  For in your pompe, and chiefest pryde, when Plagues began to seace,
                  And peoples hardned stubborne heartes, forgot the God of peace:
                  An Earthquake came, with whirling noise as House and Towre should fall:
                  A louing rodde of threatning wrath, sent sure to warne vs all.
                  For such a terror did it bring, to euery honest minde,
                  As day of Iudgement had bene come, with storme and whirling winde.
                  The stréets did shake, the Churches réelde, the ground it quiuered sore,
                  Men stoode amazde, and women shreekt, the babes did crie and rore:
                  The Stéeples tottred too and fro, and locks of doores did clinke:
                  The tiles from house came tūbling downe, and ground began to shrinke.
                  The Bels did sounde without mans helpe, the water wawmde and boylde.
                  The trées and floures did quake for feare,

as fruite should cleane be spoylde.
                  The Theatre, for (some great regarde) that open world shoulde note,
                  Was shakte so sore, that sundrye there, a feareful frighting goett.
                  Yea some were slaine, & crusht with stones from Christs Church roofe that fel:
                  And earth was brought, in such a state, as world shoulde sinke to Hel.

                  Than now they féele through Earthquake strange, wherin Gods might in knowne,
