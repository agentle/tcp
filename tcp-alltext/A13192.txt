            To the vertuous and modest Gentlewoman Mistris ELIZABETH SOVTHWELL, one of the Maides of Honor attending vpon the Queenes Maiestie.

               IN perusinge the controuersies of these times (good Christian Reader) with a minde desirous afterwarde to satisfie the honest Christian, in some questions, (wherein without question, wee are mistaken, and are not accordinge to right, rightlye vnderstoode) in perusinge these controuersies, I saye (to speake a plaine truth as in the sight of God) I founde them 
                  •
               n both sides soe full of inuectiue discourses,

as I was then sorie to reade, and am now loath to mention. But amongest other enteringe into the controuersie of the holy Sacrament, mee thought I was entred into a tempestuous Sea of all contention, for there I sawe most vnnaturall bitternesse amongest Christians, scismes in the church, factions in common wealthes, all tossinge, and turmoyling about this sacred misterie, as is wonderfull to consider.
            2 I beganne at first to admire the patience of God, to see this heauenlye

league of humane saluation, least vnto the worlde, by him who did redeeme the worlde, as a seale of mercie, as a pledge of peace and loue beetweene God, and man, to beecome by the contentious humors of manye a verye subiecte for all dissention.

But of all other, this sacred institution of Christ our Sauiour should bee fardest off from the contentious humore of anie, vpon paine and perill of beeinge a worthye receiuer of this soe holy a misterie anie more, and of true obedience to the author thereof, whoe lefte this his ordinance not to raise matter of contention, but to continue a ioifull remembrance of his loue in sufferinge and dieinge for the sinnes of the worlde vntill his second appearance or comminge againe

in glorie.
            There is a farre better, and safer course then to contend anie longer, if men woulde at last sette them selues on all partes to followe it, which is, to reuerence the sonne of God in the vnsearchable misteries of his wisdome which are past finding out; and not to stande weigheinge them in the light scales and ballance of theire own reason, to drawe a vaile ouer them, or say with the woman of Samaria Puteus est altus: this well is deepe

consideration if wee call to minde the ineffable wisdome and loue of God, who like a most prouident Father was not onelye content to prouide costly benefites for his children, but hath alsoe founde out soe beehouefull a meane for their participation of the same as is this holy misterie.

health of our soules, God forbid? they were of the Capernaites men without faith, and loue in Christ who in murmuring manner saide quomodo potest, how or which way can hee doe this, it was a faithfull and louing disciple that answered, Tu Domine habes verba vtae, Lorde thou hast the wordes of life.
            10 The people as wee reade in the Gospell who were cured by our Sauiour, they came not vnto him to know, or enquire by what meane, vertue should proceede from him, it sufficed

them to receiue health and therfore without more adoe, they gaue glorie vnto God who had shewed such mercie vnto men.

            12 Was not the Aposttles O Altitudo? O the

deapth, better then the search of the worlde in soe vnsearchable a misterie where he made silence the safest eloquence?
            13 Without all question the church of Rome hath erred, in medlinge too much with this sacred misterie, and troublinge the worlde with a multitude of vnprofitable and endlesse disputes about Transubstantiation, and the like, for which, as for there haulfe communion, lette them shewe there Accepimus a Domino: as wee haue receiued from the Lorde, or els wee plainlye

tell them, theire plea is not sufficient in lawe, and will not hold for good.
            14 Let the worlde in name of God now iudge of both, which giue greater reuerence to the most deuine institution of the Sonne of God, whether they who too busely talke of changinge the substance of the elementes into other, or they, who heare conceiue more and with more reuerence then wordes canne mention. They who saye 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , this is a greate misterie, or they who laboure to search out the power and virtue vnsearchable.

In a worde, they who will needes sette downe a manner howe Christ is present in the Sacrament, or they whoe acknowledge his presence there after a manner explicable. 15 All this while our due estimation of this so high a misterie is not fully vnderstood (as I suppose) of manie, who refuse our Christian assemblies in times beeseeming. Wee honour the passion of Christ our Blessed Sauiour in this most holy ordinance (I trust) with as dutifull hearts as any christians in the worlde. The heate of

some fanciers wee wish it were more temporate, and there zeale more according to knowledge, who euer loue to bee fishinge in troublesome waters, wee confesse that all the deuotion a Christian harte can yealde is noe way answearable to the deapth & dignitie hereof.
            16 God saide vnto Moses put off thy showes, for the grounde where thou standest is holy grounde, howe reuerently therefore wee esteeme of this sacred institution God knoweth, and what wee houlde let men consider, the

state of the controuersie it selfe is laide downe at the end in a breife admonition to the godly Reader, which admonition (some speciall reasons mouing me therevnto) I haue written in the latine tongue, vnto which I referre the learned: but cheefely I commend vnto euerie honest Christian in generall, the tracte it selfe, which onelye tendeth to deuotion. For when wee haue all done striuing aboute a hundred difficulties, it must bee our deuotion to God that must doe vs good in an other worlde.
            17 It were to be wished

most is but Soe, Soe, for the heape of volumes that treate of this subiect how they all in a manner tende onely vnto matter of contradiction, wherefore beeseech wee God to increase in vs reuerence more, and more, towardes this most holy ordinance of Christ Iesus his Sonne, that preparing our selues dutifully to receiue him in the state of grace, we may be receiued of him into the state of glory: To sit at his table in his Kingdome, to liue with him, and raigne with him.

               Of the Institution of this most holy Sacrament.
               
                  Amongest other parts of diuine worshippe & religious actions of a Christian life, which knitte men in loue and dutie vnto God (for who should haue the fruite but hee that planted the tree) there is none more solemne, more diuine, then is our reuerent accesse to the most holy Sacrament, where wee present our selues beefore God, where, wee honour him in the misterie of humane redemption, where by a spirituall vnion with Christ

him selfe wee become partakers of our greatest good. Fasting humbleth, praier beseecheth, repentance bewaileth, charitie worketh, faith beleeueth; but the holy Sacrament applieth al to the saluation of our soules.
               2 If any aske (saith an 
                     •
                  uncient Eather) the Iewes why they keepe there passeouer, all that they will aunswear is to relate of a bondage in Egipt, of Pharoe their oppressor, of a Moyses Gods seruant theire deliuerer: But if any aske mee which am a Christian of our heauenlye passeouer, I can shew him, not of Moyses a seruant, but of Christ Iesus the only sonne of God; of a more terrible Pharoe the prince of darkenesse, of a more wofull bondadge, the shaddow of death,

and last of all, of a deliuerance indeede, by the bloud of that Immaculate Lambe, once offered for the sinnes of the world. Heb. 9.28.
               2 For our comfortable accesse to this most holy misterie, wee haue Christes own precept, and his promise, Math. 26.26. Luke. 22.19 His precept, hoc faci
                        •
                     e doe this: His promise, hoc est corpus meum, hic est saenguis me
                        •
                     us, This is my bodie, which was giuen for you, this is my bloud, which is shed for you; as if, heare I offer you the benefite of all my sufferinges, & leaue you a pledge at parting, of my deerest loue, Nouum Testamentum, a new Testament, a newe league or couenant, between God, and man, that hee will now thinke vpon your sinnes

in iustice no more.
               4 S. Austen in his 118. Epistle Ad Ianuarium saith, our Sauiour deferred the institution of this most diuine Sacrament, to the end of his life, as his last farewell, that the dignitie and excellencie thereof, might make the more deepe impression in his disciples heartes, increase in them greater loue, and deuotion, after his departure from them.
               5 In the 14. and 16. of Exodus, God gaue the people of Israell for the time of theire abode in the wildernesse Manna from heauen, which manna, they gathered vntill they came vnto the lande of promise: in like manner, soe longe as wee remaine in the wildernesse of this worlde; wee are gatheringe

this our heauenly mana but when wee come vnto that promised Chanaan, then neede wee gather Manna, no more.
               6 Christ our Sauiour when the time drewe neere that hee should bee betrayed and deliuered vp vnto death, hee communeth with his disciples after this manner Luk: 22.15. I haue earnestly desired to eate this passeouer with you before I suffer; In consecrating the elementes of breade and wine, his praiers went vp to heauen, his benefites remaine with his church heere on earth, the visible signes which hee tooke, and gaue declare two thinges, the one that hee would the morrow followinge make himselfe an oblation for the redemption of

many vpon the aulter of the Crosse, the other that hee would become vnto the faithfull by this meanes a diuine sustinance for their soules And thus hee prouideth for himselfe an aulter, for his, a table in both, Gods is the glorie, and mans the benefitte.
            
            
               The first Meditation of this Blessed Institution.
               
                  COnsider howe God created the world for man, and man onelye to worshipe his Creator: A most excellent parte of which worshippe, is the holy Sacrament.
               2 Consider how the Lord

Iesus forseeinge the good of his church, and the affliction of his Apostles, to followe after his passion, decreede to leaue vnto them the holy Eucharist, that they might receiue helpe and strength by vertue thereof.
               3 Consider how hee now departing from this life vnto the Father, did institute this beloued Sacrament, that hee might leaue vnto vs, a liuelye remembrance of his passion.
               4 Consider how this remembrance is had by a spirituall repast, that as nurrishmentes and the bodie nurrished become one, soe Christ, and the faithfull receiuers: And what more heauenly then to become one with the sonne of God?
               5 Consider Christ in his passion as a Testator his inheritance

giuen is heauen, his legaces are his graces, the executor is the holy Ghost, his testament or will, promises of life laied downe in his worde, the seales are the two Sacraments confirming these promises
            
            
               The fruite of this Meditation.
               The fruite of this Meditation is this: that euerie one dispose himselfe with all deuotion to this holy misterie, that hee leaue all earthly cogitations beneath, as Abraham in the 22. of Genesis did his seruantes when hee went vp to the mount to doe sacrifice vnto God.
            
            
               
               A Spirituall Soloquie or meditation of the Soule.
               
                  O Omnipotent & euerlastinge God, make mee, I beeseech thee, 
                     〈◊〉
                   in the performance of this soe high a parte of thy most holy worship. I come Lorde as the sicke to the Phisition of life, as an offender to the fountaine of mercie, as the blinde to the light of the eternall sunne, as the poore and needie to the Lorde of heauen and earth, therefore O Lorde, cure my infermitie, pardon my offences, lighten my blindnes, enrich my pouertie, graunte that I may reuerēce this heauenly manna with such reuerence,

and humanitie, with such contrition and deuotion, with such puritie and faith, with such a purpose and intent, as is expedient for my saluation, and graunt that at last I may beehoulde perpetuallye thy beloued sonne with face reueiled, whome now I receiue in the way by faith onely: who liueth and raigneth with thee for euer and euer Amen.
            
            
               Of the loue of Christ shewed in ordaining this most holy Sacrament of his last Sup
                     •
                  per.
               
                  FOr that this Sacrament is a Sacrament of loue, and lefte vnto vs as the loue of our beloued Sauiour, it is conuenient

that to put a way the suspition of ingratitude it be receiued and handled with loue cheefely, seeinge wee can requite in no other thing the loue declared in ordayning this Sacrament soe full of loue, then by loue, of which loue God would that wee should dispose, and soe change it into what wee see most pleasing to him, whervpon, as Christ while hee giueth himselfe to vs for meat, giueth vs a token of his highest loue, with his grace▪ with soe many merites of his preachings, labores, fastings, praiers▪ soe wee, when wee giue to God our loue, do
                     •
                   giue him all thinges which wee haue most precious, hence it commeth that God doth more esteeme and that more worthyly too, of

this one loue thē of all other thinges in the world, neither doth hee require anye other thinge of vs. When els wher saith, Prouerb: 23.26: My Sonne giue mee thy hearte, that is to say the loue which is thine. When Christ our Sauiour humbled himselfe to bee Baptized of Iohn the Baptist Math: 3.14: it made Iohn more humble himselfe to Christ: his loue shoulde wounde our heartes, and make vs loue him who is loue it selfe, and this loue of his is manifest vnto vs by instituting this holy Sacrament.
               When Nathan the Prophet would shew Kinge Dauid in the 2 of Samuell 12.3: what loue the poore man bare to that sheepe which he nourished in his bosome,

hee gaue him saith hee of his owne morsels to eate, and of his owne cup to drink: Christ to shew his loue towardes vs hath giuen vs of his owne breade, and of his owne cup, nay hee hath giuen his owne bodie as breade, his owne bloude as wine for the nurrishment of our soules.
               
                  Dauid wondred at the exceeding loue of God 1. Samuell: 1.18: saying who am I, O Lord God that thou hast brought mee to this? Lorde what is earth and ashes that thou hast exalted man to this dignitie?
               God did highly honour Iosua in that hee made the sunne to stay vntill hee had the victorie, but what honour had it bin, had hee brought it downe from heauen this hath hee done for vs by the

sonne of righteousnesse who exiled himselfe 33. yeares from the throne of glorie & became the sonne of mā that wee might bee made the sonnes of God.
            
            
               The Second Meditation.
               COnsider how in this holy misterie thou art bounde to loue the guifte, with the giuer: If when the people woulde haue made Christ a Kinge Iohn: 6.15: hee had then sought to requite theire fauour it had not bin soe much: but when they gaue him gale to eate, and viniger to drinke, then to leaue this testimony of fauour and loue, it was loue without example, had hee

bestowed this foe greate: guift on the Saintes or Angells it had not bin so wonderfull, but bestowing it on poore sinners it was most admirable.
               2 Consider how great care our Sauior hath shewed to
                     •
                  wards vs in instituting this sa
                     •
                  cramēt seeing nothing could be giuen more excellēt more deere. When hee loued his which were in the world hee loued them vnto the end. Io: 13 1.
               3 Consider that Saint Chrysostome saith our Lorde instituted this diuine Sacrament that we might be made one with him, for as much as hee is such a meate as doth turne it selfe into the worthy receiuer. Soe hereby Christ doth drawe vs vnto him with the bondes of loue, and doth

in this guift allure vs to loue him, heate doth turne the nourishmentes into the bodie nourished, the same is done by feruencie of loue in faithfull receiuers.
            
            
               The fruite of this Meditation.
               The fruit of this Meditation is that euerie one meditate of the loue of Christ, say with the Prophet in the 116. & 11: Quid rependam, what shall I giue vnto the Lorde for all the benefites hee hath done vnto mee? I will take the cup of saluation, and call vpon the name of the Lorde.
            
            
               
               A Spirituall soloquie vpon this meditation.

                     •
                  te Iesus could it be that such was thy loue towardes vs, that when thou wast the King of glorie and creator of all the worlde, thou wouldest thy selfe bee meate for thine owne creatures. O Loue, thy power is too too great; for I thought sufficient that which the wise man speaketh of thy power: Thy loue is as stronge as death. But I see much more may bee spoken of it for thy arrowes ouercomming heauen doe penetrate the verye loue of God, where death doth not come nor approach, neither staying thy selfe heere, thou doest fixe this loue in

the hearte of man, and not onely plucke it away from all thinges created, but euen from it selfe.
               It was sufficient that thou wast giuen to vs for a Lorde and God, in which thinge th
                     •

                     •••
                   which the wisdome of man cannot comprehend, and it remaineth most true that thou when thou wast God of all maiestie infinite, and immortall wert made man, diddest die and suffer for vs.
               When I consider that thou in the selfesame time wherein the streames of thy tribulations did ouerflowe, wherein thy onelye thought constrained a blooddie sweat

out of thy bodie, forgetfull of thine owne selfe, and all the tormentes which were preparing, wast carefull of procuring such a meare for vs as might strengthen vs in the state of grace, vntill wee see thee in the state of glory, O amiable Iesu how truly is it written of thy loue in the 8. of the Canticles & 6 verse. Many waters could not extinguish this loue, nor floodes ouerwhelme it, namely many waters of thy passion, and floodes of thy greefe, could not with houlde thee wherby thou wouldest not prouide and impart this singular and precious guift for vs, O sweete Iesus it had beene enough to call vs brethren when thou wert humbled on earth▪ but wilt thou so call vs in thy throne in heauen?

                  Math: 25:50:
               The Prophet Elisha in the second of the Kinges 2.8. greatly esteemed the cloke of his Maister Eliath, left him at his departure wherewith hee deuided the waters of Iordaine and passed ouer on drie foote; But the Lorde and God of Eliath hath left vnto thee not any garment but his most sacred bodie that hee may bee a companion with thee in this laboursome pilgrimage, strength in tribulation, and wholsome foode in a spirituall life.
               Iudge nowe then howe much thou oughtest to reuerence him, and with what

of the Iewes to whome when our Lorde Iesus had offered himselfe for theire Maister and Captaine they renouncing his doctrine and maistership, keepe still the couering of their eies, and which was worse ioyned to theire blindnes the sinne of vnthankfullnesse.
            
            
               The excellencie and worthynes of this Sacrament.
               MOst high and sumptuous is that preparation which wisedome hath ordained, bountie furnished & Christ himselfe with his honourable presence beautified. This preparation is not as that in times passed in the wildernesse, or in the moueable Tabernacle of Moyses, or the fixed Temple of Salomon
                  
but in a great chamber, a large vpper roome, in the most ample church dispersed farre and wide vpon the face of the earth, here Christ himselfe is the giuer and the guift, the feeder and the foode.
               It is saide of Ezechiah in the second of Chronicles 30. that hee kept a passeouer and such a passeouer as neuer was there any the like before; but much more may be saide of Christs holy supper. Admire not any longer the greatnes of the guift, of the King, Assuerus in the 4. of Hester after he betrothed vnto him Hester in marriage for those guiftes were earthly and could not giue life and spirite, admire rather th

               The third Meditation.
               
                  COnsider the great excellencie of this holy and heauenly feast where Christ is receiued, the memory of his death & passion recounted the mind filled with grace, and a pledge o
                     •
                   future glorie geuen vnto vs.

                     •
                  rences which are betweene

this feast and the feasts of the world.
               1 These feastes are prophane for in them neither is there holy meate, neither are the ordained for the health of the soule, but this feast is a sanctified feast, and ordained principally for the health of the soule.
               2 In the feastes of the world there is variety, and by how much the more the varietie is the greater, by so much the more is the feast commended: in this spiritual banquet it is not so, wherein Christ being infinite containeth in him all perfection and can alone satisfie the soule.
               3 In the feastes of the world there is little speach had of death, suffering affliction, and tribulations, rather

discourse is had of matters of pleasures: but in this feast of Christ the memoriall o
                     •
                   his death and passion, his sufferinges of loue for our saluation is remembred.
               4 In this banquet the minde is filled with the grace of Christ which bringeth saluation and the increase of heauenly guiftes: but in the banquets of the world, the bodie is replenished with meates that often bring diseases to the bodie and spirituall destruction to the soule.
               5 In the feastes of the world for the great excesse vsed in them they open a way to hell: but this holy feast of Christ s
                     •
                  tteth open vnto vs the readie way to heauen.
            
            
               
               Farther considerations of this heauenly banquet.
               COnsider how well pleasing it is to the Lord Iesus that we do all those things in this his feast which guestes inuited of the prince to some solemne preparation, are wont to doe.
               1 First they expect with great desire the houre of this banquet, and giue theire diligent attendance that they come in decent and seemly manner, well adorned.
               2 Secondly, they knowing that nothing is more acceptable vnto the prince who inuiteth them, then to feede hartely on the meates prepared, they come with emptie stomackes and a desire to be satisfied.
               3 Thirdly, they diligently

beware that they neither doe or speake any thing which may be offensiue to the person which hath called them.
               4 Fourthly, they doe not by and by depart but stay awhile and enterchaung familier conference with the prince at one time praising his liberalitie, at on other the magnyficencie of the feast.
               5 Fiftly, at there departure they yeeld reuerence, & giue humble thankes for the fauour vouchsafed them, acknowledging their bounden dutie vnto so noble a prince, they offer them selues to bee readie at his pleasure, to performe any seruice he shall commaund them.
               These properties of good and thankfull guestes should

much rather be performed in this heauenly feast wherunto wee are called by the sonne of God himselfe, and therefore we should expect, receiue with ioy: yeeld thankes for this heauenly banquet.
            
            
               The fruites of these considerations.
               The fruite of these considerations may be drawne frō a meditatiō the of greatnes, & magnificencie of this so holy a misterie, which greatnesse may stirre vs vp to be thankfull to so liberall a Lord who calleth vs to so great honour, and bestoweth so many benefites, yet requireth so fewe of vs againe.
            
            
               
               A Spirituall Soloquie.
               
                  IT is no meruell O Lorde if the bountifulnes of thy holy feast doe make vs astonished, for Esaias in the 25. Chap. of hie prophecie forseeing it many ages before as a picture shadowed ouer-stood amazed thereat, and saith to the praise & glory therof: the Lord of hosts shal make to al people on this hil a feast of fatlings. Esa: 25.6: Great shall this feast be O holy prophet, for that not euerie one but the Lord of hostes shall ordaine it, and that not to certaine men alone, but to all people of the world, neither in euery place but on a hill, lastly it shall be a feast of fatlinges,

yea of the most heauenly foode that euer was.
               Be glad O holy church for that thou art that holy hill chosen of God for that heauenly banquet, in thee doth stand the table prepared, thy deere children are like the oliue branches in the compasse thereof.
               Arise O my soule and depart from thy selfe forthwith out of this dark vallie, for the lord doth expect thee at his feast, not thundring & lightning as he did to ye children of Israell in the 19 of Exodus, but he inuiteth thee wi

toucheth the hill shall die the death, Exodus: 19.23: but rather hee that commeth to the hill and eateth of this Sacrament shall liue for euer.
               But marke my soule that all cannot ascend to this hill, but only as the kingly Prophet speaketh Psalme: 15.4: the harmlesse and pure in heart this is the wedding garment Math: 22.16: wherwith we ought to be decked at Christes feast, otherwise wee shall heare those terrible wordes: cast him bound hand foote into vtter darknesse.

Lord I dare not appeare at thy holy feast what shall I doe? if for my sinnes I shall be refused of thee, what shall I doe when with shame I am forbidden to come without a garment? happily I may sow mee a garment of leaues as Adam did after hee lost the garment of innocencie giuen him of God, but alas that will little profite mee as it profited Adam when he durst not come into Gods sight with that garment but hid himselfe: but if I hide my selfe shall I not be depriued of thy heauenly and healthsome feast.
               I turne me therfore to thee O Father of mercie, and I confesse that I haue offended thee after that manner that I am no more worthy to bee called thy sonne, but trusting

to thy infinite goodnes I beseech thee that thou wilt not respect my offences but the greatnes of thy mercies. I am not worthy to bee called thy sonne make mee O Lord as thy meanest seruant.
            
            
               Of the wonderfull thinges of this Sacrament.
               
                  WOnderfull is God in all his workes, but in non more to bee admired, then in the reuerent Sacrament of the bodie and blood of our Lord, wherein the blessed sonne of God giueth many high misteries vnto his church.

                  buteth to the second

person in Trinitie, this is one: his name is wonderfull Esa. 9.11. How truly this is verified in this holy Sacrament may be left vnto the contemplation of faith which is then most strong when reason stands mute.
               When as almightie God rained downe Manna amōgst ye people of Israel the people being amazed at the sight therof, saide, Manhu: that is, what is this? and the thing seemed so wonderfull that they behoulding it truly admirable passed ouer as it were vnto vs the first word manhu, Lord what is this? what is this that the sonne of God should vndertake the nature of man and after a spirituall and heauenly manner be giuen for meate to a new people, to whom all thinges

are manifest in truth?
               What is this? that he which dwelleth in heauen, sitteth amongst the quier of Angels, would come into the world and after a wonderfull and admirable manner dwell with the sonnes of men?

                   God vnder heauen and for this inestimable misterie laud and praise his holy name.
               2 Let vs with thankfull hartes wonder at the loue of God, who after hee receiued vs into his familie, there placed vs, not as seruantes but as sonnes, and that he might shew the part of a carefull father, doth prouide a meane to nourish vs, and not contēt with that, would haue his

owne sonne to institute that meane by the spirituall participation of himselfe.
               3 Consider, the diuine wisedome of the sonne of God, who respecting our weaknesse hath conuaied vnto vs his bodie and blood after a diuine & spiritual manner, vnder the forms of bread and wine.
               4 Consider, how by this misticall Communion, occasion is giuen to exercise our faith, and to prepare our soules which liue by grace, as our bodies doe by foode.
               5 Consider the high and worthy effect of this heauenly foode, which is not so much changed into the substance of the eater, as it doth rather chang vs to a diuine essence, the meate being diuine doth make vs also diuine,

O the omnipotent wisdome, and power, & loue of God?
            
            
               The Fruite.
               The fruite of this meditation is to lift vp our selues aboue our selues, and blesse God for this wonderfull benefit, without curious searching, and needlesse questioning after the manner how, but to giue God thankes and bee ashamed rather at our selues that neither the wonderfullnes of his power, nor the greatnes of his benefites, can make vs no more to loue him then wee doe.
            
            
               The spirituall Soloquie.
               O my soule thou art happie which hast prepared for

thee so wonderfull and so high a repast as there can bee found none either in heauen or earth more, for in it is cō
                  tained that which the Apostle in the 1: & 3. to the Hebr. calleth the brightnes of the glory of God, but hidden, that he might heap on thee the more benefits, thou knowst Moyses descending from the mount Sinah on which hee had talked with God, the children of Israell could not talke with him for the brightnes of his face, wherefore as the Scripture saieth he put a couering before his face: Exodus 34.16: that all might speake with him, in like sort our heauenly Moyses hath done, who not content with thy deliuerance from the hard seruitude o
                     •
                   
                  Egipt and spirituall Pharoe, but that thou shouldest not

bee terrified with the greate brightnes of his glorie, after an ineffable manner doth come vnto thee, and commune with thee. Iacob said, surely God was in this place & I was not aware of it. Gen. 28:16.
               O wonderfull loue how farre hast thou gon with my Lord? Iust cause hast thou O my soule to reioice, and in reioicinge to admire the goodnes of thy blessed Saviour: cease to measure the greatnesse of this worke by the weaknes of thine owne vnderstanding, say rather with the Prophet Psalme 111 Memoriam facit mirabilium suorum, The mercifull Lord hath made a memoriall of his wonders, he hath giuen meate to them that feare him.
               
                  When the sonne of God clothed himselfe with our nature it was a worke verie admirable, for therein he assumed humane nature mortall, and passible, but when the faithfull receiue the holy Eucharist man doth participate a diuine nature immortal, & heauenly: Hence was it said of God, Psal. 86.9. Tu es magnus faciens mirabilia, Lord thou art great and doing wonderfull things.
            
            
               The manifold effectes and fruites of this holy Sacrament.
               WEe may remember, which we cannot forget, that as man consisteth of soule and bodie, so doth he also leade a twofold life, the one temporall,

readie to fall into a thousand dangers and casualties. The other spirituall, subiect to as many and more. The life of the body consisteth of the vnion of the Soule with the body. The life of the soule consisteth of another vnion, with grace in Christ. Both these, as they haue their defects and casualties, so haue they also their remedies and sustentations. For the life naturall, God hath ordained naturall sustenance; for the life supernaturall, supernaturall nourishment, which is this most holy Sacrament. But that which at all times is most to bee lamented is, whereas the spirituall life is farre more excellent then the temporall, notwithstanding is more regarded and preferred. For what thing doth

not a sicke body doe, to recouer his health, hee neglecteth all charges and griefes, he esteemeth nothing of the bitternesse of Medecines, he contemneth the sharpnesse of paines: the most experienced Phisitions, the best preseruatiues are sought for, and all for bodily health, which endureth for a little time And are wee so carefull for the health of our Soule? would to God we were, then would we repaire with more deuotion▪ vnto this most holy Sacrament, where our spirituall life is preserued and strengthened.
               Three things there are sayth one, necessarie for the life of man, the mother which brings him forth, the meate which sustaineth him, and the Phisition that cures

him when hee is sicke.
               The same three are necessarie for the life spirituall. The mother is Baptisme, the meate is the holy Eucharist, the Phisition to cure is repentance. Now then, as the body without meats cannot endure labours and liue, no more can the Soule without this spirituall repast, sustaine the labours of this Pilgrimage, the assaults of her enemies and liue. The ayre being corrupted when we goe forth of doores, wee fortefie vs with some preseruatiue. This world is corrupted, our preseruatiue against temptations, is this holy Eucharist.
               Men entring a way possessed by the enemie, arme themselues with weapons, get them good companie:

seeing we haue in all the way of our life many enemies visible and inuisible, shall we not arme our selues, & take vnto vs Christ our Captaine.
            
            
               Of the most principall effects of this Sacrament.
               
                  THe first is, as wee may so speak to Deifie, that is, to make man diuine, or like vnto God himselfe, heere in the state of grace, and hereafter in the state of glory, and for this cause it is instituted in forme of nourishments. For as nourishments and the body nourished, become one so Christ and the faythfull receiuers. Other meates receiue life of the body, this giueth life to the Soule.
               
                  2 A second effect is, that with Christ are giuen vs all his merites and rewards, which hee hath purchased, here the hiue is giuen vs with the honey.
               
                  3 The third effect of this Sacrament, is, that hereby a continuall and constant remembrance of Christ Iesus our Sauiour is continued, whereby we shew his death vntill he come, and therefore he sayth, Math. 26.26. Hoc facite in mei memoriam, Doe this in remembrance of mee.
               
                  4 The fourth effect is to stirre vp in vs the loue of God, and our neighbour. Of God, who first loued vs, of our neighbour, for his sake that sayd, Hee that loueth God, should loue his neighbour also, 1, Ioan. 4. 21.

               The fruits of this Sacrament.
               The fruits hereof may bee reduced to these 12. properties: the first is to quicken, 2. To set at libertie, 3. To enflame, 4. To giue patience

in trouble, 5. To nourish. 6. To restore, 7. To vnite, 8. To communicate, 9. To make whole, 10. To preserue, 11. To strengthen, 12. To conduct through, and therefore this Sacrament is called Viaticum, the prouision for the way, as Elias passed his iourney in the strength of his meate.
               It is written of Obededon in the second of Sam. 3. that he and his did prosper, because he receiued the Arke of God into his house: how much more shall this bee accomplished in those, who receiue Christ Iesus truly into their soules, the manifold effects whereof by increase of grace, from grace to grace, the faithfull feele and finde as much.

                   forthwith made partaker of his merits and righteousnes. And this is one cause why his Sacrament is called a Communion.

                     •
                  surrection and ascention: so also he desireth to communicate thee vnto his members.
               
                  3 Consider that the vnderstāding is so lightned by this holy Sacrament, that it easily commenth into the knowledge of God, whence those 2. Disciples going to Emans straight after the receiuing of bread, as the Scripture sayth, their eyes were opened, and they knew the Lord.
               4 Consider that it was not the hem of the garment, for what vertue could there bee in so meane a subiect to procure health, but it was the hemme of Christes garment. So it is not bread and wine, but this bread, this wine that sanctifieth our soules.
               5 Consider how it reneweth Gods grace, that like as bodilie foode doth renew that which naturall heate had consumed. So this heauenlie nourishment,

restoreth that which the Soule through the heate of euill desires, had lost.
               6 Consider it ioyneth vs to Christ our head, & to our neighbours, who are Christs mēbers, prouoking vs to loue them with true charitie: and therefore this Sacrament is called of the Fathers, the Sacrament of vnion & loue. For Christ by giuing his the same food, vniteth thē in one diuine essence. S. Augustine writeth that this Sacramēt is instituted vnder the forme of bread and wine. For as bread is made of many grains, and the wine one, of many grapes, so the faithful by loue and vnitie, are made one in Christ their head one, by cō

and tranquility of the minde, which cōmeth by this sacrament, yt as the ship was tossed & troubled before, but when Christ came into it, all was calme: so in this world we are often troubled, but when Christ comes, all is quiet: he would haue his Disciples say vnto what house they entred, Peace bee vnto this house, Luc. 10.5.

                  It is sure thou canst not bee extinguished with bodily death, like beastes without reason, but thou mayest die well enough with spirituall death, which is a seperation of Gods grace from the soul, as the death of the bodie consisteth in the seperation of the soule from the bodie.

                  THe obedience we all owe vnto the author of this sacred ceremony, who in the ordayning thereof had no other end but the

glory of God his father, with mans true and perfect good, and a consideration of our owne weaknesse, who stand in need of so many assistant helpes, as we do, cannot but moue vs to vse with all reuerence and desire, with all our harts affectiō this holy mean of receiuing grace, left vnto vs by the giuer of grace: For we do not celebrate a remē

feed, and the soule which is according to the image of God should bee neglected, and little respected meate vnlesse it be taken in due season doth not profit the receiuer, treasure that is not imployed, doth turne vs to no benefite. The vse and frequent vse of this heauenly repast is very godly & Christianlike, wee haue no more special meanes to relieue our infirmities, no more profitable and effectuall remedie & directiō to guide vs through the way and passage of this wearisome life.
               There are (saith one) three thinges amongst the rest, which do alwayes hold man bound to God: The first i
                     •
                   the multitude of his benefits for which wee ought to giue thankes, the second is

the multitude of our sinnes, for which we ought to aske mercie. The third is the multitude of miseries and infirmities for which wee are bound to seeke a remedie, now for the acknowledgement of our duety. The blotting out our offences, the reliefe of our miseries, there is at once no more strong & forceable a meane then this most holy sacrament, wherein wee offer praise vpon the aultar of our hearts, beg remission in his merites, who died for vs, receiue strength against all distresse of this troublesome world. Wherefore man which oweth so great and many thinges for benefites receiued, which so often laboureth vnder the burthen of his sinnes, whom so many neces
                     •
                  ities doe inuiron,

what better course then to approach vnto this diuine misterie, which is saith Saint Bernard, phisicke to the sick. The way to the traueller, strength to the weake, ioy to the hole, refuge to the poor, counsell to the rich, helpe to them that are in danger, the consideration wherof should somewhat quicken vp our slownesse in this case.
               It is the manner of marchants to frequent those places where greater hope of gaine groweth: the pore are wont to flocke thither where larger almes are giuen, and should not the Christian repaire thither where great & gainfull giftes are distributed, when hee findeth himselfe in miserie, poore, and distressed.
               The loue of God may

moue and inuite some, the beholding of their owne miseries should vrge others, some the conscience of sinne should induce, others a desire of obtaining grace, but the honour we all owe vnto God should solicite all seeing wee haue not a more high and excellent meanes of performing the same.
               One friend doth willingly come vnto another: It is a signe of small loue to Christ, when wee come so seldome to his holy Passeouer, as on the contrary his loue is augmented more & more in vs, by often communicating. A great and louing remembrance of his blessed passion, we celebrate in the frequent participation of this holy misterie, so often saith the Apostle, 1. Corinth. 11.26.

And therfore often you shew ye Lords death vntil he come.

and holinesse of Christian people did waxe lesse & lesse.
               2 Consider that by often communicating pietie and perfection of life is augmē
                  ted, the Christian man is made more religious, the bodie made chaste and obedient to the soule, the soule to God.
               3 Consider, that to receiue Christ in the sacrament with due preparation, is no other thing then to worship him with great reuerence: he therefore which by this diuine communicating doeth often receiue him, doth oftner also praise him and worship him with diuine honor, but hee which honoureth Christ in earth shall be likewise honored of his heauenly father in heauen. Luc. 9.26
               4 Consider seeing this

diuine sacrament is the meat of the soule, wherewith it is strengthened and maintayned in a spirituall life, it doth manifestly follow, by how much the more often the soule is nourished with this meat, by so much the perfecter it is made in a life spirituall.
            
            
               The fruit.
               THe fruit of this seuenth Mediation is to make a firme purpose of applying our selues to this frequent and often communicating, to beseech the Lord, that the soul may neuer loath this heauenly food, but with an inward affection desire it, from which affection springeth perseuerance & a readines to sanctimony & holines of life, a longing to walk before

                  quie.
               
                  WHat is this grace O sweete Iesu, which thou dost affect me with? for thou not only vouchsafest to open vnto me the precious mine of gold lying in the field of the holy Church, that is the hidden treasure for which the man that found it, sold all that hee had to buy that field: but also doest often inuite mee to digge so precious a treasure that thou mayest inrich my soule. But that which draweth me into admiration is, that to the purchasing of this fielde and digging this treasure as often as I will thou hast added so great a commodity that I need not

sell any of my goodes much lesse all that I haue.
               Lord if to obtaine this treasure thou hadst ordained hard fasts, long pilgrimages, shedding of bloud, and other sharpe pennances, all these labours & afflictions ought worthily to haue been suffered to tast euen but once thy sacred bodie: but O loue vnhard of that had hadst rather make the entrance easie and delectable that I might often returne to this mine. O Adam how much better is the condition of thy posteritie, then was thine which is now broght to passe by the mean of our louing and liberall Iesus: thou wert driuen out of paradise, and that thou shouldst not returne thither to eate of the tree of life and liue, one of the Cherubines

armed with a fierie sword, was set of the righteous God to keep it: But wee thy children liuing in the Paradise of the holy Church, are not only not driuē away by an Angell with a fiery sword, but are inuited of the Lord of Angels, by the fire of his loue to taste often the fruites of the tree of life, yea to receiue him who hath giuen all strength to the tree of life that giueth a blessed and euerlasting life: for so he inuiting vs, hath promised. He which eateth of this breade shall liue for euer. Ioh 6.58.
               O my soule be somewhat stirred vp, and magnifie thy God, for he which is mightie hath done great thinges for thee: doest thou not see him that he is made thy treasure to make thee rich, returne

often to digge it, it is a precious treasure, & therefore it will satisfie thy desires, it is infinite, and therefore will neuer decay.
            
            
               Of the impediments which detaine men from the blessed Sacrament.
               
                  IN the second of Exod. and 6. Pharaoh to withhold the people from doing sacrifice, causeth his Taske-masters to set them about drudgerie. It is the wilinesse of the olde serpent to draw vs from performing this holy seruice vnto God, to make the world and the flesh, distract our thoughtes and desires so to keepe vs from this spirituall part of

Gods worship, either by remisse and carelesse neglect, or at least by a timerous conceit of our vnfitnesse: this carelesse and remisse neglect ariseth of our many encumbrances and businesses in the world. We can find time to follow profits and pleasures, but for to enter into this so serious businesse of our soule we are not at leasure.
               Esau to satisfie his appetite left his patrimonie: The Gregesems respecting their swine neglected Christes heauenly presence. What great indignitie was offered vnto the rich man, Luk. 14.16. who prepared a great supper, sent his seruants to call them that were bidden to come in, whē ye vnthankful guests returned answere they were otherwise imployed, in deed they

cared not for comming.
               If feare keep any away because it may seeme presumptiō to approach vnto so holy a place as the altar of the Lord, let it bee remembred that Christ calleth all that be weary & heauy loaden to refresh them. Mat. 11. & 28.
               If slouth and negligence, let a carefulnesse of our estate to come stirre vs vp. If the affaires of the worlde, cast them all a
                     •
                  ide. If any finde himselfe cold and slow without desire and deuotion towards this heauenly meat, he ought not therefore to abstain from the holy communion, for hee shall here finde sensible deuotion, when al the powers of the soule & dispersed apetites are gathered together, whē our wil & strēgth is forceablie caried to God &

we maruellously moued to honour the passion of our blessed Sauiour. The impediments therefore considered we may endeuour then to auoide them, that so wee may come & offer our soules & bodies a sacrifice to God, that neither by the subtilnes of Sathan, the affaires of this world, the pleasures of the flesh, we bee drawen away from so high and heauenly a repast prepared for vs, as is this great misterie of saluation.
            
            
               The eight Meditation.
               
                  COnsider that the Diuel can not endure the vse of this profitable sacrament, for hee knoweth howe much it is of force to

attaine blessednes, from whence hee for his pride fell. And hee hateth the Sacrament, for in it is represented the passion, by force wherof he is bound, and thrust from the tyrannie which he would evercise vpon mankind.
               2 Consider for what causes the diuell doth labour by d
                     •
                  uers meanes and arts to withdraw men from often communicating, whence we may gather howe profitable this holy Sacrament is to the Soule, when it is manifest, it so much displeaseth Sathan the Capitall enemie of our good.
               3 Consider that our nature is of it selfe prone to euill, how the allurements of the flesh the affayres of the world, are readie to carry vs away from Gods worship,

and therefore by so much the more wee should shake off all impediments, and receiue this holy Eucharist, whereby wee are strengthened to resist temptations, vnited vnto Christ, armed with his grace, which shall protect and saue vs.
               4 Consider that whereas this sacrament is numbred amongst the greatest benefits giuen to vs of God in this life, that wee doe in nothing more auoyde the tokens of vngratefulnes, then by often communicating: for besides that it is most acceptable vnto God, the memory also of Christ is often renewed, which he also desireth to bee done▪ saying: Doe this in remembrance of mee.
               5 Consider how the intermission of this holy institution,

doth make men in time lesse religious, how it proceedeth for the most part of want of loue. For it cannot bee that one should loue Christ, and yet neglect this his holie ordinance.
            
            
               The Fruit.
               The fruit of this Meditation, is first to begge of the Lord an inward affection and deuotion to this sacrament: next, strength against the temptations and allurements, which are readie to withdraw vs from the same.
            
            
               
               The Soloquie.
               
                  BEhold now O good Iesus, by howe manye meanes my infernall enemie indeuoureth to draw mee away from thy heauenly table: At one time he assayleth me in the faith of this most holy and hidden Sacrament: at another time he tortureth mee with scruples, very often he striueth to pull me backe from many humane respects and that hee may effect his purpose, hee laboureth that the world may wi

                  hdraw me, by the affayres thereof, and that the flesh should complaine, her repentance and

turning vnto God is grieuous vnto her. O my soule, if there were not an inestimable benefite receiued by this holy Sacrament, the diuell would not bee troublesome vnto vs; yea, hee would reioyce in the time misspent herein. But the enemie of man is not ignorant of the great good that hereby commeth to a man.
               Now behold O Lorde the assaults of this aduersary of our Soules, I desire no other thing of thee, then that thy seruant I

my mercifull Iesus, that like as thou hast inspired me of thy mercifull goodnes, that I might begge the taste of this precious meate, so thou mayst bestow on mee grace to frequent the same with ioyfull perseuerance. Cause O Lord, that the memorie of this holy Sacramēt fall not from mee, otherwise I know that my heart will waxe faint, and I shal be constrained to say with the Prophet: my heart is withered within mee, that I forget to eate my bread. Let not the distrust of my owne vilenes, deterre and fray mee from such a heauenly meate, so full of comfort.

                  WHat shal I doe my sweet Iesu, for twoo most strong Captaines do greatly assault me, that is to say, Feare and Loue? Feare obiecteth to my minde, the highnes of this most honorable Sacrament, which doth make me draw backe my foote. But loue sheweth me the excellencie of that vnion', which this admirable mistery doth procure, makes that with pleasant desire I dare come into thy sight O what shall I doe? if ouercome with feare, I depart further from thy holy table, when thou hast sayde:

Vnlesse yee eate of the flesh of the Sonne of Man, you shall not haue life in you?

me so often to thy sacred feast, bring to passe that these two Captaines may not forsake me. Oh my heauēly Father, for that thou hast bound mee with so many benefites vnto thee, and tyed mee with so great bondes of Loue, I beseech thee by the same loue, wherewith thou dost alwayes prosecute thy onely begotten and beloued sonne, that thou wilt not leaue mee so bound, but rather draw mee to thy sonne, seeing thou hast promised it to mee by the Prophet Osea, when thou sayst, I will draw them vnto mee with chaines of loue. Remember also (O my blessed Sauiour) that thou hast promised this drawing, when thou saydst: When I am lifted vp from the earth, I will drawe all

               THere is, saith the Wisemā, a word clothed with death, God grant it bee not founde in the house of Israel. And there is too saith the Apostle, an vnworthie receiuing of Christ vnto condemnatiō. 1. Cor. 11.27. And God grant it bee not found amongst the society of christians. That which is to some

the sauour of life vnto life, and these are the worthie receiuers: the same may bee vnto others the sauour of death vnto death, and these are the vnworthy.
               What is therefore more needfull then to remooue al dangerous defects, which may hinder the fruit and efficacie of so high a mysterie, to remooue, I say, all sensuall desires, faithlesse cogitations, impenitent affections, and all other euils whatsoeuer, which may withdraw the heart of man from God, and hinder the good of this most excellent medecine of our soules.
               The sun to them which are in health, is wholsome, but vnto those who are pained in the head, it falleth out to bee farre otherwise. A potion receiued

in due season, doth help the Patiēt. The showres & dews of heauen, make the tree wel planted to prosper & fructifie, but that tree which hath some worm at the root, & doth wither vpward, doth more and more decay by all this moysture. The soule rooted in faith and charitie, is as a good plant, whom this heauenly dew doth nourish. the corrupt hart is that worm which maketh the withered tree to fade away so lōg, vntil the master of the vineyard say, Cut downe the vnprofitable tree. Now therfore, that the faithful Christian may be as the tree plāted by the waters side, Psalm. 1. which shall bring foorth his fruit in due season, let him in the name of God remoue all dangerous defects, as enuie, euill concupiscence,

infidelitie, and the like, that he eate not of this bread, and drinke not of this cup vnworthily.
            
            
               The ninth Meditation.
               COsider that to come vnworthily to the holye Eucharist, as without Faith, without deuotion, without repentance, without reuerēce, is very dangerous.
               2 Consider how respectiue we should be in comming to this holy mystery, how carefull, how religious.
               3 Salomon saith, when thou sittest to eate with a Ruler, consider diligently what is set before thee, Prou. 24.1.
               4 Abraham when hee was making his offering to God,

                  Gen. 15.11. the foules came to hinder Abrahams offering, as wandering thoughts would doe ours: Abraham rose and droue them away.
            
            
               The fruit.
               The fruit of this Meditation is to prepare our selues in the best and most reuerent maner wee can, that wee eate paenem Domini, contra dominum, the bread of the Lord against the Lord, as S. Austen speaketh, to remoue all dangerous defects, to bee sorie for our sins past, and resolue vpon amendment, for the time to come.
            
            
               The Soloquie.
               SEest thou not my soule that it is thy part to come with all deuotion and attētion

of mind vnto this holy 
                     •
                  acracramēt▪ Remeber that when God, Exo. 19.1.3. was to talke with Moyses vpon the mount, how he cōmanded ye neither man nor beast should approach to the Mountaine, least Moyses by the sight of any creature, should bee disturbed: yea, that hee should haue fitter oportunitie of attention, without distraction, the whole hill was couered with a great & darke cloude. No otherwise, my soule, do, that no euill affection come with thee to the holy Altar, which may draw thee frō deuotiō: here God doth expect thee. Consider with thy selfe that hee can neuer bee truly desired and loued of thee, vnlesse in comming to this sacred table, thou cleane forget all earthly things. Heare

what the Kingly Prophet saith, Psa. 45.11. My daughter hearken and consider, incline thine eare. Forget also thine owne people, and thy Fathers house, so shall the King haue pleasure in thy beautie, for he is thy Lord God, and worship thou him. But O Lord, what shall I doe to attaine this deuotion? for my minde doth remaine so corrupt, since that generall fall of our first Father Adam that often times against my will, it wandereth vagarant where it shuld not, what shall I do when my infernall enemy either indeuoreth by many earthly occasions to draw me away from this heauenly table, or to come (which is no lesse feareful) vnworthily vnto the same. Thou seest O mercifull Iesus, in what state

I stand, that is to say, howe weake I am by nature, helpe I beseech thee, my weaknes with thy holy grace, that all defects remooued, I may approach vnto thy heauenly table, with heart and soule prepared.
            
            
               Of preparing our selues before we come to the most holy Sacrament.
               
                  IF in our earthly affaires, wee often times forget heauenly, good reason is it that in our heauenly wee should much rather forgette all earthly businesse whatsoeuer, and prepare our selues to this so solemne a ceremonye, which doth consecrate man vnto God.

Christ sent 2. of his Disciples before to make ready the vpper roome, wher he would keepe his mandy with his Apostles: our faith & repētance as 2 messengers may prepare before the vpper roome of our souls. The Israelites keeping their Passeouer, put leuē out of their houses. Christ washeth his Disciples feet, & the Prophet Dauid sayth, I wil wash my handes in innocency, & so wil go to thy Altar. Psa. 26.6. Hester cōming to find grace & fauour in the sight of Ahashuerath, first hū
                  bleth her selfe by fasting and prayer. Iacob comming for a blessing, putteth on Esaus garment. Wee are approaching to the Lords Altar, comming for a blessing, seeking fauour, what should we else but wash our hearts

by faith in the blood of the Lambe, humble our soules: Take vnto vs the garment of Christes righteousnes.
               Againe, it behoueth euery one that will safely come to this table to direct all his affections and desires to God onely. To do nothing, to affect nothing but Gods pleasure respected and his heauenly grace now offered.
               For him which will rightly bee partaker of this holy misterie: First, faith is necessarie, whereby hee belieueth remission of his sins in Christs merites.
               2 Secondarily repentance is necessarie, whereby he acknowledgeth the greatnes of his sinne.
               3 Thirdly, charitie is required whereby the mind is at peace and quiet with men,

hee that dwelleth in charitie (saith S. Iohn) dwelleth in God, and God in him: dwelleth in God, what more secure, and God in him, what more sweet?
               4 Fourthly, attention must be had, that he bee not carried away from respectiue deuotion, and chiefly from the meditation of Christes passion, his resurrection the third day, his descention into hel, his ascention vp into heauen, his glorious sitting at the right hand of God, from whence he shall come at the ende of the world to iudge both the quicke and dead.
               5 Fiftly, fasting is necessarie, where by the Prophete Dauid humbled his soule, Psal. 35.13. Hester by fasting disposed her selfe to God, and found grace in the

sight of Assuerus, Hest. 4 16.
            
            
               The tenth Meditation.
               
                  COnsider howe busie & carefull Martha was, Luk. 10.40. to receiue Christ into her house, and therefore much more careful should euerie one bee to receiue him into his heart.
               2 Consider, what reuerence and deuotion is meete by that of the Prophete of Christes entrance into heauen: Be ye lifted vp ve euerlasting gates, and the king of glorie shal come in, Psa. 24.6
               3 Consider, that to entertaine an earthly prince all things are made decent and cleane.
               4 Consider, it was saide

to him that came vnto the mariage feast after an vnseemely manner, friend, how camest thou in hither, and hast not on a wedding garment. Mat. 22.12.
               5 Consider how the Apostle S. Peter, when Christ would wash his feet, thought himselfe vnwor
                     •
                  hy that so great honour should be done vnto him said within himself what am I worme that the Lord of light should doe this vnto me.
            
            
               The fruit.
               THe fruit of this Meditation: The first is, to prepare vs with all humble reuerence, but chiefly to offer vnto God the sacrifice of a broken and contrite heart, that as his bodie

was broken for vs, so should our heart be broken.
               2 The second is to crie out with the Prophet, Crea in me Domine nouum cor: Create in me O Lord a new heart.
               3 The third is to become surueyours of our selues, and call a little consistorie in our owne soules.
            
            
               A forme of confessing our selues before we come to receiue the most holy Sacrament.
               
                  O Lord thou art not wonte to driue away sinners, but callest them, and conuertest them to thee: Thou

art he that hast said, Mat. 11.26. Come all that are weary and heauie loaden: It was publikely spoken of thee, that thou didst receiue Publicans and sinners, and didst tate with them: O my Lord thou art now at the throne of mercie, and therefore hast not chaunged thy nature, which thou hadst sometimes here in the world. Thou calledst them from heauen whō thou didst cal on earth: wherfore comforted with this remembraunce of thy loue I come vnto thee loaden, and labouring & burthened with my sinnes, I come as the sick to the Phisition, beseeching thee to heale mee: As a sinner to the welspring of righteousnesse, beseeching thee to iustifie me, I acknowledge I acknowledge, my great vnworthines.
               
                  If thine owne holy Apostle, or as he seemed, prince of the Apostles, could crie out and say, Go from mee O Lord for I am a sinfull man: how much more shall I who am an vnhallowed creature and prince of sinners say: I am not worthy to whō thou shouldst come, nay, I am not worthy to come to thee, much lesse to receiue thee.
               It was lawfull for none to tast of the shew bread which was onely a shadow of this profound misterie but onely for him who was cleane and sanctified, how shall I eate thereof, who am so farre remoued from true holines? It was so great an offence to touch thy sacred Arke that Vzzah stretching out his hand to touch it. The 2. of Kinges, 6.7. was suddenly

stricken, how can I not but feare & tremble in this case? O Lord as I feare thy greatnesse. So do I also feare the multitude of my sinnes. I am that foole, Psal. 14 1. that said in his heart there is no God. I liued so dissolutely as (by my manners I profest as much) I feared not thy iustice, I dreaded not to transgresse thy lawes, I rendred not thanks as I ought: What other thing hath my life beene then a dayly warre against thee? What other thing haue I done by my sins and carelesse comming to this misterie of former times then offered thee open wrong, stricken thy blessed head with a reed? My sinnes haue beene the speare that gored thee, the thornes that pearced thee: How therefore

shall I bee so bold as to come vnto thee? Shall I repose thy sacred bodie in a denne of Dragons, a nest of Scorpions? what other thing is a soule ful of sinne? wherefore doest thou cast thy childrens bread vnto dogs, and thy precious Margarite to swine? How wilt thou rest with me O my Lord which art the puritie of a virgine, the fountaine of all pulchritude? Thy most holy bodie taken from the crosse, was wrapped in fine linnen, laide in a new Sepulcher, wherein neuer any was laid, but what part of my soule is cleane, what new? How then shall I receiue thee O my Sauiour and redeemer? I am ashamed so often as I behold my selfe in such a state, I blush considering, what I

am, and whether I am about to come, my refuge is to flie vnto thy mercy according to which mercy O Lord looke vppon mee, did the stones cleaue asunder when thou sufferedst thy passion & shall my stonie heart bee nothing moued for whome thou didst suffer? did the earth moue, and shall my earthly mind stand vnmoueable like a dead center? noe noe, I am moued O my Sauiour.

But didst accept her, saying, bee of good comfort daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole, I haue a greater issue, and come vnto thee to be cured. I call to minde Marie Magdalene, who washed thy feet with her teares, and wiped them with the hayre of her heade who had much forgiuen her. Behold here lyeth a sinner which hath more sinnes, but fewer teares, shee was not the first nor the last whome thy mercie receiued, receyue mee O Lord though I haue not shedde so many teares as may washe thy feete, yet hast thou

shead as much bloud as can wash my sinnes O my Lord thou hast not chaunged thy office and nature though thou seemest to bee farre away.

               I offer vnto thee an humble heart, and had I many hearts, I would offer them all vnto thee, Lord I can be no more without thee, nor liue without thee then can this bodie of mine remaine when life is taken from it. Wherefore necessitie driueth mee vnto thee, and mercie ministreth boldnesse, by howe

               A Meditation vppon these wordes of the centurion. Mat. 8.8 Non sum dignus vt intres sub tectum meum. Lord I am not worthy that thou enter vnder my roofe.
               
                  O Lorde hadst thou rather be at an other mans house with dishonor then at thine owne with honour? at least O good Iesu, if thou hadst no respect of thine honour if thou castest vnder foot all praise & renowne, if thou takest vnto thee euerie vile sinner, yet haue regard to my estate: Lord I confesse I am not worthy thou shouldest come vnder my roofe: Thou knowest my pouertie and need I

haue this poore cottage farre vnmeet to cetertain so great a guest as thou O my Lord: This body is not compact of gold & siluer, but of dust & ashes, and also subiect to infirmities, diseases and death. This soule ioyned to my bodie is farre from that holines it should bee endued withall, farte vnmeet a place is it for such a personage, I am altogether confounded, I tremble & shake at the comming of so great a guest into so poore a house as my selfe.
            
            
               Tantum dic verbum & sanabitur anima mea. But onely say the worde and my soule shall liue.
               ANd art thou ignorant O my Lord who thou art, what a one, and how

great. Thou art God omnipotent, thou art Lord of all, thou art the Creator of heauen and earth, & whatsoeuer is contained in the vast compasse thereof, thou hast raysed me vp as all other things els of nothing: Thou hast clothed me with this bodie, and hast giuen me a right & and righteous soule: thou hast restored this soule fallen from the state of innocencie. Thou hast illuminated it by grace, and washed it in the sacred Fonte of baptisme, O my Lord thou art he that rulest and gouernest me, thou wouldest for my sake become man, die for mee, suffer for mee the verie death of the crosse, so much could loue and charitie preuaile with thee, Lord, thy grace is sufficient, and wilt thou turne

then into my house to refresh my faint soule, to cure mee being weake, and heale me being sicke? will not thy only word suffice where with thou hast cleansed the leapers, dispossessed the Diuels, raysed the dead, it will suffice O my Lord, Dic verbum, & sanabitur anima mea, say the word & my soule shalbe healed.

my soule, O my soule I will shew the great ioy, reioyce and be glad, for thy Creator commeth vnto thee, thy Sauiour cōmeth vnto thee, who hath fought with thy enemies, sustained woundes, spent his life for thee: Behold how he desireth to enlarge thee with the most ample gift of his most blessed diuinitie? Where wilt thou lay vp these things my soule? How great is hee to whom the thrones and dominations serue, on whome the holy host of heauen do attend?
               O my soule admire the wonderfull pietie, and ineffable dignitie wherewith hee hasteth to visite thee, and maketh speed to come vnto thee? But arise, runne forth to meete him, hasten this meeting, reioyce and congratulate

for the comming of such a guest, crie with a deuout heart: Lord what is man that thou art so minde full of him? Psalme 8.2. and say with the same Prophete who am I that thou hast brought me to this? 2. Sam. 7.18.
               
            
            
               The Soloquie.
               
                  LOrde, howe much doest thou submitte thy selfe while thou dost not disdain to enter into the vile cottage of my soule? It was sufficient for thy loue to bee borne for me in a stable? That thou descendest from heauen to rest in the womb of the blessed virgine was not such a

maruell for that it was the wombe of a most pure creature, O holy Elizabeth who being visited and saluted by the mother of this Lord considering the dignity of this maiestie didst say whence cōmeth this vnto me, that the mother, of my Lord commeth to me? Therefore what shall I say to whom the Lord himselfe commeth by infinit parts, farre aboue Marie? he commeth vnto mee not onely to visit me, but also to vnite me to him, and enrich me with heauenly gifts. O my soule, I greatly reioyce that thou hast deliuered to Iesus of thine owne will the gouernment & possession of thy selfe? but vnderstand that by this acte thou are bound to proclaime open warre to all sinnes the capital enemies

of thy Lord to whome thou art deliuered, neither canst thou any more without manifest offence of rebellion giue an entrance of sinne into thine house now dedicated vnto Christ. O my soule enter into consideration, see with what bond of relouing Iesus who hath loued thee, first thou art bound; O God, how vnlike are thy doings to the actions of the princes of this world?

Thou doest O most gracious Lord not onely shew vs thy treasures, but freely bestow them vppon vs, I see not O my soule how thou art able

to recompence so great good wil only yeeld thy self wholy to the loue of thy redeemer, for it cannot be thou shouldest serue two maisters: It cannot bee that the Arke of God, and the idoll Dagon, 1. Sam. 5.4. should stand in one temple: If thou prostrate thee to the loue of creatures, thou shalt vndergoe a hard seruitude; but if thou followe Christ thou shalt find rest and quiet.

               A meditation vpon that which Saint Paul teacheth in the first to the Corinthians, Chap. 11.
               
               
                  COnsider that the Apostle in the preparation to the most holye Communion, requireth three things: the first is, that the Communicant examine his owne conscience, which is signified in these words, Let a man proue himselfe, and so let him eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup. If hee find his conscience defiled with some mortall sinne. let him make a most humble and penitent

confession thereof.
               2 Secondarily, the Apostle would that the holy Eucharist be receiued worthily, otherwise the dāger is great: for hee which with a corrupt mind and euill intention, approacheth vnto the Lordes table, eateth and drinketh his owne iudgement.
               3 Thirdly▪ S. Paul would that a difference be made betweene these holy Elements, consectated to a most diuine vse, and the prophane repastes of the body onely.
            
            
               A Meditation vppon that of the Prodigall Sonne, when he was receiued of his Father. Luke 15.20.
               
               THese three things which the Apostle requireth in this preparation, may

bee considered in the receiuing of the Prodigall sonne.
               First he feeleth with griefe his own misery, he acknowledgeth his own vnthriftines, confesseth his sinne, whereby inclusiuely hee craueth pardon, which done, his father receiueth him.
               2 Secondly, he is clothed with a new garment, which may signifie the cloathing of righteousnes, which is made white in the bloud of the Lambe, Apoc. 7.14.
               3 After all he sitteth down at the table, catcth the fatte calfe, or that blessed sacrifice that was once offered for all, is entertained with mirth and melodie. For is there not ioy in the presence of the Angels of God in heauen, ouer one sinner that repenteth? Luc. 15.10.
            
            
               
               The Soloquie vpon this preparation.
               
                  LOrde although thy Apostle had neuer mentioned the purity of consciēce, which is required to this diuine sacrament, who would not iudge that thou the fountain of all puritie, oughtest to be receiued with a pure & clean hart. O most merciful Lord, how little dost thou require of vs, to eate of that Lambe sent of thee from heauen, by whose offering wee are deliuered from the seruitude of sinne.
               The Iewes to eate their Pascall Lambe, which was

but a shadow and figure of this, ought to prouide them a Lambe of a yeere olde, Exo. 12.13. without blemish, which rosted by fire, should bee eaten h

hast said of the law, Math. 11.28. My yoake is sweete, and my burden light, yea truely, so light and sweete, that if there were not that would imagine a labour in the precept, it shuld not deserue the name of a burden or yoke.
               O my soule, now thou seest to how few thinges Christ hath bound thee, and how he hath giuen thee aboundance of his grace in this life, by the benefit of this most holy Sacramēt, & in the other life eternall. Onely take heed to thy self, that seeing the Lord of his infinite goodnes, hath giuen thee so easily this inestimable commoditie, thou dost not againe relapse into destruction.

               Thou shalt doe well to imitate the example of the poore country man, who vnderstanding that the King would rest in his house, remooued al things which hee thought might offende the Kinges eyes, diligentlye swept all his house, and although hee could not beautifie it according to the worthinesse of such a guest, yet hee did as much as hee was able, to receiue him in seemely and decent manner,

he goeth to meete the king with all speed, receiueth him with great ioy, giueth him many thankes for this so great fauour. If then so many things are done to an earthly King, what wilt thou doe O my Soule, to the King of heauen, who commeth not to liue at thy cost, but to impart his goods vnto thee? Labour therefore in clensing and decking thy selfe, hange the chamber or vpper roome of thy best deuotion, with the Tapestrie of holinesse, and welcome him with loue, who of Loue sayth, My delight is to be with the sonnes of men, Prou. 8.31.
            
            
               
               A Meditation for the day we are to Communicate in.
               
                  IN what day you communicate, as soone as you awake early in the morning, thinke that the Lord doth expect you this day at his heauenly table. Thinke of putting on the inward ornaments of the Soule, as Faith, Repentance, Deuotion, Charitie, Humblenes of mind, & such like.
               1 Consider how Christ in his conception, tooke our nature, and that wee in this spirituall conception of him, should expresse many diuine

qualities of his nature.
               2 Consider you are to receiue him this day in the state of grace, who shall one day receiue you in the state of glory.
               3 Consider that of the first eating it was sayd, that day thou eatest thou shalt die, but by this eating, that day thou eatest thou shalt liue, Ioh. 6.
               4 Esteeme thy selfe vnworthy, and say, Sweete Iesus what loue is this thou pursuest mee withall, behold Lord I prepare my self this day to receiue thee into the poore Cottage of an humble hart, but alas. the Wiseman Salomon himself, when he had in many yeeres, and by much cost built thee a Temple, 1. Kin. 8. Did notwithstanding maruaile that thou the God

all Maiestie, wouldst vouchsafe to abide and dwell in it. what shal I say, who haue bestowed so little paines. so small cost, in preparing thee a Temple, I beseech thee to turne my Soule into a house of prayer, to whippe out all euill affections, that it may bee rightly sayd to bee Domus tuae, Thy house.

               A Meditation taken out of the History of Zacheus. Luke 19 2.
               
                  
                     ZAcheus desirous to see Iesus, but for that hee was of a lowe stature; hee

could not see him for the multitude of people, he went vp into a tree where Christ should passe by.
               2 Christ passeth by, and casting his mercifull eyes on Zacheus, sayd, Zachee, make haste to come downe, for today I must abide in thine house. He came down then all reioycing, and receiueth him into his house, thinking that hee was greatly rewarded.
               3 Thirdly, the Iewes when they saw Christ turne into the house of a sinner, they murmured, which Zacheus perceiuing, turning to Christ, sayd, Behold, halfe of my goods I giue to the poore, and if I haue defrauded any thing from any mā, I restore foure fould. But Iesus sayd vnto him, Saluation

is come vnto thy house.
            
            
               The application of this Historie.
               THat thou mayst be partaker of saluation, which is offered in this sacrament, it is necessary that thou be desirous to know and tast Christ, which is contained in this holy mysterie. And to knowe him, it is necessarie first, that thou lift vppe thy mind on high, and consider the greatnes of God, keeping in the meane while, the ground vnder thy feete, as Zacheus kept it, when hee stood vpon the tree, that is, to procure that our temporal businesse bee then vnder vs, and not ouer our head, by distracting vs in deuotion.
               
                  2 Wee must receiue our Lord not with melancholie or anguish of doubts, but as Zachee did with ioy, which springeth from a vehement affection towardes this holie Sacrament.
               3 Consider that it is not sufficient to receiue Christ into our house, & then to put the hand in the bosome, but wee must furnish the sacred Communion with good works, by releeuing the necessities of our neighbours, after the example of Zacheus,: and hee which doth so, shall heare that comfortable voyce, This day saluation is come into thine house.
            
            
               The fruit.
               THe fruit of this Meditation, shall bee to desire

and ask of God, an affection to this Sacrament, frō which affection springeth spirituall consolation, necessarie to the Communion.
            
            
               The Soloquie.
               
                  O My bountifull Iesus, how liberall art thou towardes him, who doth desire and seeke thee? Zachee was held with desire of thee, but of seeing thee onely, and thou not onely didst shewe thy selfe to him to be seene, but also calledst him, and inuitedst thy self into his hous, on whome to augment thy fauour, thou bestowedst

Saluation. Oh how well hath the Prophet sayd of thee, All Nations seeking thee, shall reioyce and bee gladde And let them say alwayes which loue thy sauing health. The Lord bee magnified.
               
                  Zachee thou worthily reioycedst, because thou hast him in thine house, which maketh al Angels to reioyce. Onely reioyce and esteem as nothing, if the Iewes murmur and cal thee sinner, since hee is at hand for thee, which can defend and iustifie thee, ioyne thy selfe to him, and he will be as a buckler for thee, and thou shalt also vnderstand how sweet the Lord is. O my soule, thou hast also cause of reioycing, and peraduenture greater then Zacheus had, seeing to thee also this day commeth the fountaine

of all ioy and gladnes Heare what the Prophet Zacharie sayth vnto thee: Reioyce O daughter Sion, and be gladde O daughter Ierusalem, behold thy righteous King and thy Sauiour commeth vnto thee, nor commeth hee to exact a tribute, or to command any task, but onely for the cause of sauing thee, & defending thee from the rebuke of thine enemies. Think not that a greater benefite shewed to Zacheus then to thee, for while thou dost spiritually receiue him vnder the accidents of bread and wine by faith, and after a most heauenly manner, hee sheweth that he is come vnto thee, not onely to conuerse with thee, & bestow saluation, as hee did to the house of Zachee, but also to vnite him

selfe to thee, that thou maist bee one certaine thing with him, which is the effect of this heauenly meate.
               Who doth not see then that this is a far greater benefite? oh my gracious Lord, seeing thou hast vouchsafed to enter this poore house of mine, giue me grace that it happen not to mee, as to the vngratefull Iewes, who in the day of Palmes, receiued thee with great ioy and triumph into Ierusalem, but a little after they cried to Pilate, crucifie him, crucifie him, & casting thy crosse vppon thy shoulders, cast thee forth of this citie. Let me die O Lord before, yea, let me dy a thousand deaths, then that I cast thee out of mee. For that were to thrust thee out of thine owne house.
            
            
               
               A Meditation vppon those words of Christ, Luk. 19.5. Hodie oportet me manere in Domo tua. To day I must abide in thine house.
               
                  WHo am I O most bountifull Iesu, that thou desirest to abide with mee? who am I that may deserue to entertaine thee the Lord of heauens? What dost thou find in mee', that doth so much delight thee, and inuite thee to come vnder my roofe? art thou ignorāt of my most vile beginning? I am not of the number of that celestiall

and diuine Legion, I am not a Seraphin, not an Archangell, not an Angell, nor any of the Thrones, or other most sacred Spirits, my being differs much from thē, freed are they from all admixtion of body, pure, and innocent, I was born in sinne, drawing my beginning frō the earth, so meane a subiect, I am not worthie. O my Sauiour, of thy diuine presence, happily thy delight is to bee with the sonnes of men, true, but I am not Abraham, I am not Moyses, I am not as the blessed virgin, no, I beare not the least similitude of these blessed Saints in heauen, while they remained in the world, What shall I say? I am sorie O my Lord, I am no more worthie to receiue thee then I am, but my comfort is,

thou tookest mercie on the woman of Canaan, and all distressed people that came vnto thee.
            
            
               A short forme of confession to bee made in priuate, before the receiuing of the blessed Sacrament.
               
                  I Miserable sinner, confesse & acknowledge with bended heart, and handes lifted vp in the presence of Almightie God, my many and manifolde sinnes, and that I haue transgressed

sundry waies against the precepts of the first and second table, I am sory from the bottome of my hart, and it greeueth mee that I haue so often offended thee, I come vnto thee as an humble sutor, to obtaine mercie and pardon for all my offences, I beseech thee to sanctifie me by thy holy spirit, to strengthen my faith against all assault

               An admonition moouing all to reconcile themselues, and forgiue their enemies, before they be pertakers of the most holy Sacrament.
               
                  WHen thou bringest thy gift to he altar. (sayth Christ our Sauiour, Mathew 5.25.) and there rememberest that thy Brother

hath ought against thee, leaue thy offering before the Altar, & go thy way, first bee reconciled to thy brother, & then come and offer thy gift. In the 11. also of Saint Mar. and 25. hee sayth vnto his Disciples: When you shall stande to pray, forgiue, if you haue ought against any man, that your Father which is in heauen may forgiue you your trespasses. By both which testimonies of holy Scripture, we learne, y• all our oblations and prayers, (otherwise in themselues amongst the best actions of a Christian life) are in no case acceptable vnto God, without our reconcilement & charity first had with mē. The Wiseman, Eccl. 28.2.3. could thinke it vnmeet in very reason, to ask mercy, whē
                  
we our selues denie mercie. We may remember, that the vnthankfull debter that wold not remit his f

               With what countenaunce (saith one) can we looke vp to heauen and say, Lord forgiue vs our trespasses, and yet reuenge with all extreamitie the least offences offered vnto our selues. Noe, no, hee that seeketh vengeance, shall surely find vengeance, Mihi vindictam, ego retribuā

                     es, how often soeuer he sinne against thee, so often shalt thou forgiue.
               The offering vp of sacrifices in the olde lawe was a speciall parte of that worship the people were wont to performe vnto Almightie

God as an acceptable seruice vnto him. But the prophete Esai telles them, Esa. 1.11. all their offerings were vtterly displeasing vnto him, for why? they were all set on crueltie, and reuenge, their hands were ful of blood and therefore God woulde accept of no sacrifice at their handes. Our oblations that are done in loue with God, and man: these ascend like the smoke of Abels sacrifice, and are wel pleasing vnto the most highest.
               But howe shoulde fleshe and bloode forgiue, where wrong and iniurie hath been offered? that which Adam cannot bea

necessitie doeth often moue compassion: but to loue our enemies wee haue no reason in the world, but onely for his sake who hath commanded all those who professe his name, and expect his kingdome saying, Diligite inimices, loue your enemies. We forgiue, and why? Christ hath forgiuen vs, wee shewe mercie, and why? Christ Iesus hath shewed mercy vnto vs. Quid contra nos proximus, saith an ancient father, shall wee see what our neighbour hath done against vs, and shal we not see what Christ hath done for vs? God forbid? All that we do, or can forgiue are pence only, Christ he forgiues tallentes, wee some few, hee ten thousand; wee shew loue, but Christ shewed loue in deed, loue without

example. Were we as readie to remember benefites as wee are iniuries, wee would bee more charitable then we often are.
               But being readie to reuenge, doe wee know how soone wee may stande in need of God our selues? no verily? and therefore we had need to shewe compassion to others.
               When as now Iacob their father was dead, Iosephs brethren thought Ioseph would reuenge all the wrong they before vniustly offered their brother they were deceyued, Ioseph telles them he meant nothing lesse.

               To moue Christians to this loue, Christ our Sauiour goeth further and sayeth: forgiue, that you may bee children of your father, which is in heauen, for he causeth the Sunne to arise on the iust, and on the vniust.

                     rose told a great Emperor of the world how Christians did auenge themselues: our weapons (saith he) are our prayers & our teares: we weep for our persecutors, wee pray for them.
               Neither shal our forgiuing go away emptie for this actiue mercy shewed vnto men, shall be rewarded with passiue mercy by him, who hath said: Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtaine mercy. Hence it commeth to passe, that our enemies may doe

vs as much good as the best friends we haue in the world: whereas in forgiuing them wee receiue forgiuenesse of God: but for one drop of water giuen, wee receiue by a gainefull interest a whole ocean sea, for our two mytes, the whole treasure of the temple. We giue and forgiue some small benefites, trespasses, but with God there is no depth of his bountie, no number of his mercies.
               If at any time we are iustly moued (as we often are) to vse that Quid rependam, as of the Prophet, Psal. 116.11. what shall wee doe vnto the Lord for all the benefites hee hath done vnto vs? then most especially approaching to these holy misterie: which the old Christians in the Primitiue Church well remembring,

They forgat not that charge left by Christ at his departure from the worlde: by this shall men know that you are my Disciples that you loue one another, nor that louing entreatie of Abraham

had with Lot, Gen. 13 11. Let there bee no strife betweene thee and me, betweene thy heardmen and my heardmen, for we are brethren.

Corinth. 13. liue in peace, and the God of loue and peace shall be with you: and to the Ephesians he saith, let all bitternesse, and anger, and wrath, bee put away from you, with all maliciousnesse bee courteous one to another, forgiuing one another, euen as God for Christes sake forgaue you. There is but one bodie, one spirit, on faith, one baptisme, one God which is aboue all, through all, and in vs all.

                  O Lorde Iesus Christ which art the onelie Sonne of God the most high king of kinges, Lorde of Lords, the image of the Father, the brightnesse of eternall light, whom the Angels do only desire to behold, who after all thy suffering, praying for thine enemies, now sittest at the throne of glorie, who am I that doe presume not onely to beholde thee my God, but also to take and receiue thy bodie into the lodging of my bodie, and house of my soule, contaminated

sinner. O miserable that I am, and most vnhappie of all men which doe this so exceeding great iniurie to thee my God and Sauiour? for when a thousand yeares of teares are not sufficient to receiue at the least but once worthily this reuerent and most precious Sacrament, so high and diuine a misterie, I wretched and vnworthy creature dayly offending and adding sinne vnto sinne, vnprepared, and of a heart lesse contrite and purged, doe notwithstanding take vppon me often to receiue it. But for because thy mercy is greater by infinite then my miserie, neyther hath it beene heard from the beginning of the world that thou hast euer despysed the prayers

of the humble, which sauest them that trust in thee, and which hast shed thy precious bloud for our saluation, and the saluation of the world, & for an euerlasting pledge of thy loue towardes vs hast ordained this Sacrament, trusting in this thy vnspeakable loue, I most humblie thinke of comming to thy table, of putting out from the house of my soule, the sower leauen of hatred and euill will towards all, that I may keep this holy passeouer with the sweet bread of sinceritie and loue.
               Graunt me thy grace, that this holy misterie may turne and become effectuall to the life and saluation of bodie and soule, that I may firmely abide in thee, which intend to receiue thee into

mee.
               Let my mind bee confirmed amongst so great misteries with thy comfortable presence, that it may vnderstand thou art present with her, and reioyce perfectly before thee, the fire which alwayes burneth, the brightnesse which alwayes shineth, sweet Iesu, good Iesu, the bread of life which refreshest vs euer, and yet neuer decayest, which art alwayes eaten, and remaynest alwayes whole, inflame and sanctifie thy vessell, purge it from malice, fill it with thy grace, and being filled, preserue it euermore in thy holy loue, which liuest, and rugnest one God worlde without ende. Amen.

wine offered of him, were a figure of the body & bloud of Christ, which (hee being a King and priest after the order of Melchisedech, Psa. 109) offered to the most high God, and afterward left to vs his body spiritually vnder the shew of bread, and his bloud vnder the forme of wine, the holy fathers with one consent doe teach. But of this Figure wee learne, as in the most holy Sacrament, wee fruitfully receiue Christ, and obtaine a blessing of him, so it is necessarie that first wee prepare a fight against the vnruly motions of our minde, and put away our sinnes by the workes of contrition and confession, as that valiant Abraham cast out the King his enemies.
               2 A figure of this most

royall Sacrament was the shew bread, which was kept on the table of propositiō in the sight of God, Exo. 25. Leuit. 24. none could eate of this bread, but those which were cleane & sanctified, and therfore it was caled the holy & sanctified bread, 1. Ki. 21. Math. 12.4. By which is signified, that if wee be fed with the sacred bread of the law of grace, prefigured by that bread, it is necessarie that wee bee chaste, and that we haue a good conscience.
               3 A figure of this diuine Sacrament, was the cake baked vnder the ashes, which the Angell brought to Elias, by vertue whereof he being strengthened, as the holy Scripture in the 3. Kin. 10. Cha▪ doth testifie, walked 40. dayes & 40. nights, euen to

the mount of God, Horeb, where afterward hee saw the Lord. This figure doth signifie the power and effecacy, which the holy communion doth yeelde vs, to finish the troublesome peregrinatiō of this life, euen vntill we come to the heauenly hill, where we shall see God with incredible pleasure.
               1 Now as common bread doth procure the preseruation of the life temporall, 2. doth augmēt & strengthē it. 3. although often eaten, yet it doth not breed lothsomnes, yea, rather it is an euill signe whē bread doth not relish to any one. 4. A feast▪ without bread, although it abounde with most costly dishes, is vnperfect. So this heauēly meat vnder the forme of bread▪ 1. doth preserue a spirituall life,

2 By conferring grace, which is the life of the soule, it augmenteth the same, and maketh it strong against the diuell. 3. This sacred meat to men spiritually minded, neuer bringeth loathsomenesse but it pleaseth not the sicke, that is for because the natural man perceiueth not ye things which are of God. 1. Cor. 2.4.
               Let the Christian man haue all the goods of this mortall life, if that bee wanting him which is contayned in the holy Sacrament lie hath nothing▪ yea rather he may truly bee called miserable. 5. Lastly the bread before it cō
                  meth to his perfection it suffereth many things; for the graine of corne which is the matter thereof, is first sowen & is couered in the earth, thē is cut, bound as a malefactor,

imprisoned in the barne, is threshed out, winowed, groū
                  ded in the Mill, is boulted, scorched with fire so that it may very well agee with this Sacrament, wherein the elementes are, not whole, but broken, powred out wherein also the passion of Christ our Lorde his suffering so great thinges for vs, is represented, before he become this diuine foode of our soules.
               4 The Pas
                     •
                  all Lamb was a figure of this Sacrament, Exod. 12.3. of which this was the ceremony. It must be a Lambe without blemish, of a yeare old, it must be eaten at Ierusalem rosted, and in haste with wild Lettice, and sweet bread: those who shold eate thereof must haue their shooes on their feete, by

which ceremony God signified to the Iewes that they were strangers. Saint Chrysostome in his 83. Homely vpon Mathew, applyeth in this manner that ceremonie vnto vs: If (saith hee) the Iewes about to go onely through Palestina, were fed with a Lambe after so curious an order, with what vigilancie ought we to be fed in this Sacrament, with the true immaculate Lambe, which haue our iourney to heauen? do eate thereof in his church, heat with charitie, going forward to our land of rest, in 15. of Leuit. God saith, you shall eate of the old fruit, vntill the new come, so did his people of the old passeouer, the same day they were deliuered from Egypt had wee deliueraunce from a worser

seruitude of the Pascall lamb a bone must not bee broken; those parts of this lambe are the faithful, as if it were from God sacrificate filium, sacrifice my Sonne, Sinite hos abine, let these go Iohn 18.
               5 A Figure of this, was Manna, giuen to the people of Israel in the desert, Exo. 10.15. Saint Paul saith that the redde Sea was a figure of Baptisme, and Manna of this holy Sacrament, which Manna had these properties.
               First although some gathered much, and others lesse yet there was one sufficient measure for all, so in this Sacrament of the Lordes Supper there is no lesse vertue in the lest part thereof then in the whole.
               2 Manna might be gathered any day except the Saboth,

and when the sunne arose it vanished. So this venerable Sacrament serueth vs vntill the euerlasting Saboth of the life to come, and when the Son of glorie shall appeare, it shall then cease.
               3 Manna did giue taste of all kind according vnto the will of the eater. This Manna hath sweetnesse vnto the faith of the faithfull receyuers so and so disposed.
               4 Many of the Iewes were grieuously punished, for that they contemned Manna, saying our soule loathed this light meate. Numb. 21.5. So S▪ Paul sheweth 1. Cor, 1
                     •
                  . & 30. That in his time many were weake and sick among thē, for that this most diuine Sacrament was dispised and many vnworthily communicated.
               
                  6 The sixt Figure was the Arke, for like as the Arke saith, Th. Aquinas was made of Shitim wood, Exod. 25.10. that is to say, of shining and pure cedar: so was this of the most pure bodie of the Sonne of God. Againe, the Arke was guilded within & without, which may resemble the wisdom & loue of Christ. Ther were 3. things in the ark of speciall note, The golden pot, the rod of Aaron, and the two tables of the law.
               The golden pot contayning Manna may betoken the soule of Christ contayning the fulnesse of the dietie: The rod of Aaron his priestly power, the two tables, that he was the eternal lawmaker.
               But the holy scripture maketh mention of two things principally concerning the

Arke which do maruellously appeare in this Sacrament.
               The one, that by the befite of the Arke the people were not onely preserued. but much pestered. The other, that God grieuously punished those who vnworthily entreated this A
                     •
                  ke, or gaue not worthie reuerence vnto the same: we reade Samuel 1. & 4. when the people of Israel in one warre against the Philistines had lost foure thousand men, they procured that the Arke was brought into their tents, hoping that by the presence thereof to obtaine the victorie. But the contrary happened, for the Arke of God was taken by the enemie, and 30000. men perished of the host of Israel for their peruerse▪ life, and small pietie.
               
                  The Philistines also which vnworthily handled the Ark setting it with their idolatrie so sharply were they punished, but chiefly the men of Ashdod, as that the holy scripture saith, 1. Sam. 5. The hand of God was greeuous vpon them.
               7 A figure of this Sacrament was the meale of Helizeus, 1. King. 4. when the prophet commaunded that certaine hearbes should bee sodde for the children of the prophets, they tasting them found that they were so bitter, that they cryed to Helizeus, O man of God death is in the pot? Wherefore the holy prophet cast meale into the pot, wherewith he tooke away the bitternes: So Christ by meale or bread of the Sacrament taketh away the bitternesse

of our afflictions, & causeth that they bring vs life and not death.
               8 A figure of this most holy institution was that great Passeouer which K. Hezechiah kept, 2. Chron. 30.17. whē he prayed for the people that God would be mercifull vnto him, that prepared his hart to seeke the Lord God of his Fathers though hee were not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary, when he spake comfortably vnto the Leuits, & the whole multitude kept the feast with great ioy. Our Hezechiah hath not onely praied for the purifying of his people, but hath sanctified them, spoken comfortably, kept a ioyfull passeouer, such as neuer was in Israel.

               A short Meditation vppon these names of excellencie.
               
                  WHat couldest thou do most merciful Lord for vs and our good that thou hast not done? Thou hast taken our fraile nature vpon thee, and giuen vs thy diuine, thou hast freely offered vnto vs the riches of thy mercie, the treasures of thy grace, the abundance of thy loue, by this great inestimable, and most diuine Sacrament, by this blessed, pure, and venerable misterie, the mistery of peace and pietie, the holy of holies, the hidden Manna, whereby it is euident, with what

flames of loue thou didst burne, whose delight is to shew mercy: And because the fire of this loue could no longer be hid, it must needs breake out by this holy misterie left vnto vs, For which O Lord wee giue vnto thee honour, prayse, power, and dominion, now and for euermore, Amen.
            
            
               Certain short meditations vpon the passion to be vsed before and after the receiuing of the holy Communion.
               
                  O Good and gracious Iesu, thou didst eate the Pascall Lambe in Ierusalem, with thy deare beloued disciples, and arising from supper didst gird thy selfe about

with a towell, and powredst water into a bason, and kneeling vpon thy knees, thou meekely didst wash the feete of thy disciples, and wipedst them with a towell.
               O most good & gracious Iesu, thou before thou shouldest suffer, didst bequeath a most excellent good thing vnto thy children, leauing for vs thy most sacred bodie to be our meate, and thy most precious bloode to bee our drinke, there can no wit nor vnderstanding penetrate and throughly see the bottomles depth of thy charitie.
               O most good and gracious Iesu, thou comming to the garden of Oliuer, begannest to feare, and to bee heauie, wherupon y• saidst to thy disciples▪ My soule is sorrowfull vnto death. And then diuided

and sundred from thē, thou setst thy selfe vpon thy knees, and falling vpon the earth flat on thy face, thou prayedst vnto thy Father, and fully and wholly resignedst and yeeldedst thy selfe vnto him, saying, Father, thy will bee done, and at length through most painefull agonie, wherwith thou was grieuously oprest & afflicted, thou sweatest throughout all thy body a bloudy sweate.
               O good & gracious Iesu, thou kindled & burning with an ineffable desire to redeem me, wentst to meete thine enimies, & sufferedst Iudas the traitor to kisse thee, thy selfe to be taken, & to bee bound with all confusion & shame, & most vnworthily to be led vnto Annas, where thou sufferedst most meekly to bee

striken on thy most innocent face.
               O good & gracious Iesu, thou being fast bound like a notorious malefactor, wast led vnto the house of Cayphas the high Priest, wher the Iewes most vniustly accused thee, most spitefully struck & buffetted thee, scornefully wast thou mocked, & blindfolded, being bidden to prophesie who strucke thee, doing to thee innumerable iniuries all the night.
               O good & gracious Iesu, thou in the morning wast broght before Pilate, & with most sweet & plesant coūtenāce casting thine eies down, stoodest before him in the Iudgemēt hall, & when thou wast most fasly accused of ye Iews, & many a rebuke & reproach was giuen thee, thou meekly heldst thy peace, and

madest no answere.
               O good and gracious Iesu thou was sent from Pilate to Herode: this Herode of a very curious and vaine mind coueting to see some miracle at thy hand, asked & demanded many things of thee; the Iewes cried out against thee, but thou amongst all these most wisely heldst thy peace: For this cause Herod and all his despised thee: O how vnmeasurable was this humility and obedience▪ at the will & pleasure of thine enemies thou wentst forth, thou returnest again, suffering thē to do to thee what they would.
               O good and gracious Iesu thou in the iudgement hall stripped naked, and without all compassion being bound fast to a pillar, wast most cruelly scourged, there was thy

virginall and tender flesh cut with whips, and torne with stripes, altogether mangled, and deformed, with blacke & blew, and many a wound, so that the streames of thy most precious blood ranne downe on euery side vpon the earth.
               O good and gracious Iesu after that sore and sharpe scourging of thine, to put thee to more shame thou waste clothed with a purple red garment, vile and torne: They also making a crowne of thornes painefully pressed the same vpon thy most holy heade: and while the sharpe thornes pricked grieuously, & wounded sore thine head, thy most pure blood ranne down aboundantly ouer all, thy louely face & neck, then they putting a reed into thy right hand, and kneeling

downe before thee, in scorne saluted thee saying, All haile King of the Iewes.
               O good and gracious Iesu, thou wast brought forth by Pilate vnto the furious Iews, to bee gazed & looked vpon, wearing thy crown of thornes & purple garment, but they cryed out with more cruelnes to haue thee crucified.
               O good & gracious Iesu, thou wast deliuered vp vnto the will & pleasure of the Iewes, which by and by led thee to bee crucified, laying thy heauie crosse vpon thy sore and bloudy shoulders: thus didst thou beare most meekly thine owne crosse, whose great weight pained thee ful sore, & cōming vnto the place of thy suffering, all weary and breathlesse wyth paine, for my sake thou didst

not refuse to taste wine mingled with gall and mirrhe, which was there giuen vnto thee. O good & gracious Iesu whē thou wast stripped naked thē were thy sore woūds by the violent plucking of thy clothes renewed, O what a bitter and cruel paine didst thou suffer when thy tender hands & vndefiled feet were with blunt and rough nayles fast nailed to the crosse, and when the ioyntes of thy lims were loosed, oh with what loue and sweetnes of charity didst thou offer thy hands & feet to bee bored through? Then out of the woundes of thy hands & feet as it had bin out of the wels of thy precious blood plentifully gushed out. O good & gracious Iesu, thou hanging vpō ye crosse betweene two theeues, wast assailed with blasphemies, but

thou praiedst vnto thy father the while, saying: Father forgiue it them, they wot not what they doe. Then didst thou promise Paradise vnto the thiefe: then gauest thou thy deare beloued Mother (who pearced with the sword of sorrow stoode by the crosse) vnto thy disciple Iohn; and after thou haddest suffred three long houres intollerable paines, and thirsted very vehemently, they gaue thee eysell to drinke, which when thou hadst tasted bowing downe thy venerable head thou yeeldedst vp thy spirit
               O good and gracious Iesu, O good shepheard thus thou bestowedst thy selfe for thy sheepe: the right side of thy bodie was opened with a speare, out of which flowed

both water and blood, for vs thou wouldest that thy louing and tender heart should be wounded, for my sake af

My dear beloued, yea the deare beloued of all my desires, thou didst vouchsafe thus to die & bee buried for my sake, which liuest and raignest blessed, & glorious, for euer and euer, worlde without end, Amen.
            
            
               A Prayer.
               
               O Sonne of the liuing God, most highest God, which for thy exceeding great charitie that thou didst beare towards me hast vouchsafed to bee made man, thou wouldst for my

sake be borne in a stable, and laid in a manger, to be fedde with the little milke of the maiden thy mother, to suffer needines and pouertie, to be sore troubled three & thirtie yeares with manifold labors and careful paines, thou woldest for very inward paine & agonie bee all in a bloodie sweat, and to be apprehended and taken, shamefully bee bound, vnworthily to bee condemned, vniustly to bee stricken with buffettes and blows, to be cloathed in purple by way of mockage, thou wouldest bee beaten & torne most cruelly with stripes, crowned with thornes, ouerl

woūded. And with innumerable sorrowes afflicted vpon the crosse for my sake: Thou sheddest for mee thy most pure & precious blood; all this thou didst for mee. I embrace in the armes of my soule thy venerable passion, I forsake and renounce all sensuall pleasure, I resigne all, put me wholly into thy hand and pleasure: thine onely wil, thine only wil be done in me.
               O most sweet and merciful Iesu, mortifie whatsoeuer liueth sensually in me, garnish and adorne me with thy merites and vertues, Oh prepare Lord a delectable and pleasant habitation for thy selfe in mee, renue my spirit, my soule and my bodie with thy excellent grace, knit mee vnto thee most neerly, change & transforme

me altogether into thee, that thou mayest haue delight in me. Heare mee graciously O Lord, heare me graciously, not at my will, but at thy blessed pleasure. O Lorde teach me, direct mee that I may do nothing, speake nothing, thinke nothing desire nothing, but that which may bee acceptable before thee, Amen.
            
            
               A prayer of S. Augustine, Meditat. 1.7.
               
               
                  WHat hast thou cōmitted most sweet child, that 
                     •
                  hou shouldest bee so iudged? What hast thou offended most louing innocent, that yu shouldst be so hardly intreated? what is thy offence? what

is thy fault? What is the cause of thy death, and occasion of thy condemnation? For I it is that am the wound of thy sorrow, the cause of thy slauter, I am the desert of thy death, the wickednesse of thy punishment, the stroke of thy passion, the labour of thy torment. O wonderful manner of correction, and order of vnspeakeable mysterie, the wicked offendeth, & the iust is punished, the guiltie transgresseth and the innocent is beaten, the vniust sinneth, and the iust is condemned, that which the euil man deserueth, the good suffereth and what the seruant cōmitteth, the Lord discharg
                     •
                  th, what man hath offended, God satisfied. Whether O Sonne of God, whether hath thy humilitie descended?

whether hath thy charitie burnt? whether hath thy pitty proceeded? thy benignitie increased? whether hath thy loue attained▪ whether hath thy compassion extēded? for I haue done wickedly, and thou art punished, I haue cō
                  mitted the offence, and thou art chastened, with reuenge I haue done the fault, & thou art subiected to torment, I haue waxē proud, & thou art humbled, I am puffed vp, and y• art diminished, I became inobedient, & thou paidst the punishmēt of inobedience, I gaue my self to gluttony, and thou art afflicted with hūger. The tree carried mee to vnlawful desire, perfect charity ledde thee to the tree of the crosse, I tasted of the forbidden fruit, and layedst vnder the torment, I am delighted

with meat, and thou laborest at the doore, I inioy delicates, and thou art torne in peeces with nailes, I the sweetnesse of an apple, thou tastedst the bitternesse of gaule. Eue reioyceth laughing with me, Mary suffereth wayling with thee, Behold the king of glory, behold my impietie, and thy pittie shineth, behold my vnrighteousnes, and thy righteousnesse appeareth. What O my King and my God, what shall I render thee for all thy benefites which thou hast bestowed on mee? for there cannot be found in mans heart, which may worthily be rendred for such rewards, can the sharpnes of mans wit deuise wherto the mercy of God may be compared. Nor is it the part of the creature to recōpence

the sufficiencie of the Creator. But there is O Sonne of God, there is in this so admirable despensation, to which my weakenes may in s
                     •
                  me things relie. If my mind pricked with thy visitation crucifie her flesh, with the vices and concupiscences thereof, and this thing when thou hast graunted, it beginneth now as it were to suffer with thee, for that yu hast vouchsafed to die for my sinne. And so by the victory of the inward man▪ by thy conduct, it shall bee armed to the outward triumph, for as much as this spirituall persecution ouercome, it may not feare for thy loue, to yeeld it selfe to the materiall sword. And so the smalnesse of my condition, if it please thy goodnesse, shall bee able for her

power, to answere the greatnesse of the Creator. I pray thee for thy accustomed mercyes, powre into my woundes, that the rankor of my viperous infection cast forth, may restore me to my woonted health, that tasting the nectar of thy sweetenes, it may cause mee to despise with all my heart, the plesant allurements of this world, and to feare no aduersitie thereof for thy sake, & mindfull of my eternall nobilitie, I may loathe the windes of this transitorie feare. Let nothing be sweete I pray thee vnto me, without thee, nothing please mee, nothing precious, nothing beautifull beside thee. Let all things I beseech thee bee vile vnto mee, without thee, let them be of no account: that which

is contrarie to thee, let it bee troublesome vnto mee, and let thy good will bee my continual desire. Let it grieue me to reioyce without thee, and delight mee to bee sorrowfull for thee. Lette thy name be my comfort, & the memorie of thee my consolation. Let teares bee my bread day and night, in searching out thy iudgements. Let thy law bee better vnto mee, then millions of gold and siluer. Let it be delightfull vnto mee, to walke in the way of thy commaundements vnto the end.
            
            
               
               The twelfth Meditation. Concerning the spiritual communion of Christ.
               
                  FOr yt the spiri
                  
                     •
                  uall Communiō also is profitable vnto soules, it is necessarie that wee enter into some consideration of the same, and therein obserue these circumstances.
               First what it is, secondlie, after what meanes it may be vsed, thirdly, what profite we reape by it, fourthly, how acceptable it is to God. For the first, wee must knowe that as the Sacramentall

Communion, hath worthily the first place amongst all the spirituall exercises of a Christian life. So also, the spirituall Communion hath a very godly and diuine vse. When the deuout man (saith Gerson) doth euery day receiue spiritually the body of his Redeemer, so often doth hee mystically communicate the mystery of Christs birth and passion▪ is inflamed in his loue, and reuolued in his deuotion: so when wee receiue Christ in affection and desire of minde (which the faithfull often should doe) this is called our spirituall Communion.
               For the second, what commoditie this bringeth to the Soule, wee may gather by the manifold effects thereof. For as hee which moued by

the holy Gost beleeueth, sorroweth for his sinnes, and by louing God, desireth to bee baptised, doth obtaine the grace of Baptisme, which desire of Baptisme is called by the Diuines, Baptisma spiritus, the Baptisme of the Spirit, so doth it also happen in this spirituall Communion.
               3 The third, howe wee reape profite by receiuing Christ into the holy desires of our Soule, it may be easily vnderstood by the increase of loue, While I was musing sayth the Prophet, the fire kindled. The eleuatiō of the mind vnto God, doth take vs away from earthly affections, and carrie vs vnto him, on whom our desires are fixt
               4 How acceptable this is vnto God, wee all know, hee that accepted the intention

of Abraham, and said vnto Salomon, because this was in thine heart, doth not onely accept of our good desires, to embrace him in the armes of our affection, hut also doth reward this desire as the deed done. But we are to consider, that we must not onely stay vpon the desire of our will, and receiue Christ spiritually, but wee must proceed farther, to receiue him together, both spiritually and sacramentally. For it is not inough to follow Christ in our intention, but wee must also receiue him in this holy mysterie, wherein we shew reuerence vnto his blessed institution, and that wee are become his Temple, as the Apostle speaketh, 1. Cor. 6. wherfore that we may be partakers of

so great a blessing, as is our vnion with Christ, wee may not omit this speciall part of our Christian duetie, which hee who will please God, and proceede to the perfection of a Christian life, must often vse, that so hee may goe forward in all vertue and holinesse of life, yea, euen vnto the end.
            
            
               That this holy Sacrament is giuen to the sicke, as necessarie for the time of any visitation.
               
                  COnsider, that amongst the effects of this heauenly Sacrament, that

                     •
                  ely numbred, that it maketh those strong in induring temptations▪ which worthily receiue it. Whence it is, that in times past it was giuen to men in places of visitation, or danger of death, that they might bee constant in the confession of Christ, and able to withstand the temptations of the diuell.
               2 Consider that it also profiteth to attaine the health of the body, seeing it is so auaileable to the saluation of the soule. For if at the onely touch of Christs garment many receiued health, what cannot Christ himselfe doe, entring into the Soule of the sicke?
               3 Consider that Christ, foreseeing our conflict to come, ordayned this most holy Sacrament, for the

spirituall helpe of our soules, we must think by how greater necessitie wee labour, by so much this sacrament doth exercise more effectually his wholsome effects, seeing it is proper vnto the Lord to helpe more readily, then when greater necessity doth require.
               4 Consider, that here the distressed either in bodie or mind, may apply vnto himselfe in particular, the merits of Christs passion, and raise vp himselfe by a comfortable participation of this holy mysterie, and say: Thou hast good cause to reioyce O my Soule, that the Lord of maiestie commeth vnto thee, that hee may comfort thee departing this world, and by thy assistant helpe against the assaults of Sathan, who

indeuoureth to draw thee away from the reward of life, continue onely a good will for all, though thou art faint and feeble, though thy enemies bee many and mighty, yet hauing receiued diuine strength, thou shalt say, I can doe all thinges in him that strengthneth me. Cast all thy hope on Iesus, and thou shalt neither be ouercome of thē, nor put to shame, thou knowest well that the body of a certaine dead man was restored to life, 2. Kin. 13. by the onely touch of the body of Elizeus. If the boones of a dead Prophet had so great vertue, that they restored one from death to life, and the theeues amazed by the miracle of the thing, durst doe no euill, what will not the

liuing and glorious bodie of Iesus doe
                     •
                   entring into thee, I doubt not but it will exercise greater might in thee, seeing hee is God omnipotent, and Lorde of all, and the diuell shall be ouercome and confounded at his presence. O holy Daniel, teach mee howe I ought to giue thankes to my louing Lord, who seeing me in time of neede beset with infernall Lions, doth sende me food not by the Prophet Abacucke, Daniel. 14. or by any heauenlie Angell, but himselfe commeth to bee my foode. O Loue without measure. Cōsider O my Soule, this vnspeakeable mercie, thou knowest thou wast loued of him in his greatest extremities,

when hee departing out of this life vnto the Father, did institute this holy sacrament for thy welfare. Thou seest also hee loueth thee in thy extremities, it remaineth, that crying out with the Prophet Dauid, Psal. 8. Lord what is man that thou art so mindful of him, or with the Apostle, Rom. 14. If I liue, I liue vnto the Lord, if I die, I die vnto the Lord, to whom bee prayse and honor for euer, Amen.
            
            
               
               What he ought to doe, who is to communicate before hee come to the holy table of the Lord.
               
                  HEE who will doe the thing which he oght cōcerning this Sacrament, and that which the dignitie of such a mysterie doth require, must lot out a certaine space of time to himselfe, wherein hee may performe those things which pertaine to the preparation thereof.
               And that we may discourse more at large of this matter, and more familiarlie

with them which doe often communicate, I say they shall do very well▪ if as Moyses commanded the people, that three dayes before they were to receiue the Lawe, they should prepare themselues. So also they should prepare themselues in three dayes, that they may bee apt and disposed to receiue the Lord, which bringeth a Law, not of death, but of life, not of the letter, but of the spirit, not of feare, but of loue
               The holy Scriptures do testifie, that the maides of the king Assuerus, Hest. 2.12. cō
                  ming only into his sight but once in sixe moneths, prepared thē with oyle of mirrhe, and other sixe moneths with certaine sweet odors. If these did doe this that they might find fauour with an earthly

man, what preparation shall bee required of v

                  ound fauour with God, and ought it to seeme a hard and troublesome thing vnto vs to do, for so great glorie and dignitie, that which this women hath done for such vanitie? With what face I pray, will wee refuse labour? yea, although all the powers, & strength of our soules & bodies were to be imploy
                     •
                  ed that we may come at least but into the grace & fauor of God, specially when wee heare that these miserable maids spent their whole life,

that they might come into the fauour of one mortall man. But because this is an hard thing for vs to doe, at least let vs prepare our selues in those three daies whereof I haue spoken, doing al that which in vs lyeth. But if you shall aske mee what that is, I say that the first thing is that thou walke carefully all this time, that with the holy man Iob thou feare all thy works, that thou haue diligent regard of thy selfe, & throughly examine thy conscience, and that thou take heede in all thy conuersation, that thou committe nothing, which may offende the eyes of God, not onely mortally, but negligently, also, as much as thou canst. Neither onely ought wee to decline from the sinnes themselues,

but also from the occasions of them, as immoderate laughing, pastimes, and wanton sports, and all vaine conuersation, and all those exercises which are seldome done without sinne, no otherwise, saith a learned man, then a handsome and adorned woman, when on the Saboth day shee hath put on cleane apparrell, and goeth forth abroad, doth most diligently beware that shee handle not those thinges, wherewith shee may be contaminated▪ So wee in this time ought to walke more carefully then at another, and to bee 
                     〈◊〉
                   loathed, that wee may bee worthie to come to receiue the King of Angelles, and sitte at his Table. Before all thinges the tongue must bee kept

with all diligent care all this time: in the old law, the vessels without couer were counted vnclean. Let regard be had, that the mouth vtter no vaine & idle words, much lesse offensiue, that the doore may be kept pure and clean, through which that heauenly foode shall enter to our Soule. No lesse diligently let the heart bee kept pure from all vain, vncleane, and vnquiet cogitations. For an vnseemely thing is it, that in the place where GOD should take vp his mansion, to leaue any thing offensiue to his cleane and heauenly sight. And because the place of his abiding is peace, for in peace saith the Psalmist, is his staying. Lette vs therefore put farre from vs all vnquietnesse

of minde, and perturbations whatsoeuer.
               The euening beeing come when as thou shouldst Communicate, early in the morrow following, verie laudable is it either to misse a meale, or else at the least to bee content with a small or light Supper, after which thou mayst not eyther betake thee to pleasurable delights, or be present in the concourse of mam

                  , but that thou mayst bee quiet, and more fitte to spende a good part of the night in preparing thy mind for the daye following. When thou art layde in thy bed, before sleepe doth close thy eies, perseuere & cōtinue in good thoughts, beseeching God that hee deliuer thee frō all idle fantasies and

illusions of the diuell, that thou mayst the next day goe vnto the Lords table, with more puritie both of bodie and Soule. So often as thou awakest in the night, by and by call to minde the same thoughts in prayer.
               Very earlie in the morning, thy eyes not yet fully opened, thinke thou art lying in the armes of Christ crucified, exercise thy minde in the remembrance of his passion, about which wee spend the day following, sometime thinking of his ineffable Loue, sometime of his extreame suffering, in a word, because this sacrament was instituted in remēbrance of his Passion, most profitable and acceptable vnto God, is our deuout remembrance of the same, that

by this meanes we may accomplish also the will of the Testator.
            
            
               The manner of communicating vsed by a certaine virgine.
               
                  In prax. vit. sprit.
               
               
                  BEfore the communion I prepare my selfe after this manner some two daies before, I examine mine owne conscience, I humblie confesse me, and am hartely sorie for my sinnes: when I may not fast, at the least I eat and drinke sparingly.
               2 The nexte morning I beginne sooner then at other times a prayer in my minde, therin desiring grace of God

to be communicate and that he make me such a one as I ought to be, comming to his holy table, that this most holy Sacrament may obtaine in my heart that fruite which it obtayneth in the heartes of them which worthily communicate.
               3 Then I consider how great a thing it is to bee partaker of so holy a misterie, to receiue him whom the Angelles adore, the Prophetes haue desired, the Apostles loued, the martyrs imitated, and all holy men coueted with vnspeakeable desire, to honour, loue and vnite them vnto him by this holy Sacrament.
               4 Moued with this desire, I studie to enflame my soule more largely, by considering Christs vnspeakable loue by calling to mind the manifold

graces this sacrament bringeth with it to the soule of the deuout communicant.
               5 When I come to communicate I exerecise my hart in these contemplations. 1. I call to mind my own vilenes, 2. I cast my selfe downe at the fe

                  esus by humility. 3. I make a short confession of my faith, as I belieue that thou art the very Sauiour of the world O blessed Son of 
                     •
                  od▪ which wast crucified for me, dead and buried, descendedst into h

                  ll and didst rise againe. 4. I am sory that I come so little prepared as I do, but euer hoping hee will accept my humble intention, I put my trust in his mercie and merites.
               6 Sometimes I talke thus with my soule, saying: behold my soule thy Lord and God, loue him whom thou desirest

with such care, account thy selfe happie if thou acknowledge him, loue him, desire him to dwell with thee.
               7 La
                     ••
                  ly, I lay before him all my sinnes and infirmities had in the depth of my heart, and I most feruently desire, that hee would pardon them all, & I purpose earnestly to amend and so with al humble reuerence I come to the Lords table.
            
            
               My demeanour after the Communion.
               
                  AFter the communion I betake mee to some secreate place that I may talke onely with my Lord, whom I haue by faith receiued into the house of

my soule, and first I set before God the Father the holy sacrifice of Christ our Lord, and I set before him whatsoeuer he hath suffered for me, vsing these or the like words.
               Behold O eternall Father thy sonne whom of thy infinite loue thou hast sent from heauen vnto the earth, that hee might take flesh of man, be borne in a stable, flie into Egypt by the persecution of Herod, & should be in great pouertie. Behold O Father, what great thinges hee hath done and suffered for mee in the wildernesse, in preaching, in fasting, in praying, in iourning, in persecutions of the Iewes, in hearing blasphemies, sustayning iniuries, and reproaches; all which he suffered at the handes of the vngratefull Iewes, see him,

               Behold the heauens and earth mourning after their manner, the sorrowfull mother, the deere disciples bewayling him, and the vngratefull Iewes by so much the more to waxe madde against him: I offer him vnto thee annointed with myrrhe, wrapped in cleane linnen, buried in a newe

sepulcher. These thinges done, I make an end, praising, blessing, and giuing thankes to God that hee hath loued vs, so that he gaue his onely sonne for our saluation.
               2 Secondly, I turne mee vnto Christ with alll thankfulnesse for his benefites▪ and I open vnto him as vnto a most holy phisition my infirmities, and all my faults as to a most gentle Lord, I open vnto him all my defectes into which I am wont to fall, desiring him to minister a remedie that I relapse not so often, and specially I pray that hee would graunt mee grace to receiue him hereafter worthily.
               3 I purpose to amende, wherin I am wont to offend, and namely, I decree to

roote out some one sinne, in the place whereof, to insert some vertue, whereof I haue neede, that I may alwayes goe forward from better to better, and I humbly pray his diuine maiestie, that he grant mee strength to execute that thing.
               4 Last of all, I diligently keepe my heart all that day, thinking that the Lord resteth therein as his house, wherefore I giue my in

                   that I may vse all modestie, as well in speaking, seeing, & walking, as in al my outward cōuersation, often I say with my selfe: This day O Lord, thou hast come▪ to mee a sinner, this day thou hast renewed my heart by thy holy Passion, I pray thee abide with mee, goe not from me. And so applying my selfe

vnto the prayers of the day, I vse the same prayers with greater deuotion then ordinarie, I giue thankes for all benefites, especially for those receiued by this most high and holy Sacrament.

               4 You must prepare your soule to receiue the bodie

and bloud of our Lorde Iesus.
               5 You must meditate of Christs passion, his resurrection, and your owne rising againe to a better life to come.
               6 You must giue your selfe both before and after this most holy Sacrament, to prayer and deuotion.
               7 You must applie your selfe to meditation, and open to God the closet of your heart.
               8 You must beare sincere affection and loue, both to God and man.
            
            
               
               A Dialogue of the most holy Communion, between a worldly man and a spirituall.
               
                  Wherein is disputed whether it be better often to communicate or abstaine from the most holy Communion, how & after what manner both may be done, that of loue, and deuotion: this of humilitie, and reuerence.

                  I know not truely what fruit there is by often communicating, for I see thee continue subiect to the same vices, to be often

angrie and threaten▪
                  
               
               
                  Spirit.
                  But I knowe certainely that by the benefit of often communicating I haue rooted out some euill manners, and vnlesse I should often communicate without doubt I should be worse and worse, and happily at this hower I should burne in hell fire.

                  Spir.
                  For that I haue experience in my selfe when the time of communicating is at hand, to bethinke my selfe more and more carefully to abstaine, yea from the least sins. Contrariwise when the time of communicating is farther off, I am not so collected in minde, I waxe also faint in deuotion, I am prone to vanities and trifles, and if no other profit should come vnto

my soule, that profit alone ought to bee sufficient to moue me to frequent this diuine Sacrament.
               
               
                  Mund.
                  But I feare not a little least if I come too often to the Lords table I make shipwrack both of loue and feare, for that is wont to fall out by too often vse and familiaritie.
               
               
                  Spirit.
                  Yea rather the contrarie doth often fall out, for if of the often and familiar custome and frequentation of the communion any imperfection were therein couered there were iust cause to diminish our loue and feare towards him as it commeth to passe in humane thinges: But that thing is not so: for when hee is a certaine infinite sea of all perfection, by howe much one vseth this often familiraitie, by

so much the more hee declareth his goodnes & perfections, and causeth that loue, feare, and reuerence towards his diuine maiestie, do equallie increase.
               
               
                  Mund.
                  Let it be as it is, dayly experience teacheth that the often vse of a thing although the best doth breed contempt & lothsomnes.
               
               
                  Spir.
                  But that is in things temporal, and in sensual pleasures, but in spirituall delights (as Saint Gregorie hath well obserued) saciety doth breed a desire, for then the goodnesse of them are made knowen, and therefore by how much the more surely they are possessed, by so much the more ardently they are desired, whence the heauenly wisedome saith: They which eate me doe still hunger, and they which drinke me do still

thirst.
               
               
                  Mund.
                  But Saint Paule saith, Hee that eateth and drinketh vnworthily, eateth and drinketh his own damnation, but if thou communicate often, it seemeth thou thinkest thy selfe woorthy, and is not this pride? Thou also dost vnworthily Communicate.

                  As if to Communicate seldom, doth make a man worthie. It is not so. But heare mee, if thou calst him woorthie, whose perfection doth equall the worthines of this Sacrament, thē no creature, although the holiest, yea, nor all creatures put together, were worthy of this Sacrament. And if such worthines were so necessary, none should cōmunicate, for that none can attaine perfection equall to thi

                      sacrament. But neither that any be worthie

is it necessary, that he attaine some excellent perfection, or bee endued with rare vertues, for these are acquited by the rare vertues of this sacrament, and frequenting therof. Therefore that a man be worthy according to that of the Apostle S. Paul, it is enough that hee bring that preparation wherwith God is contented, that is, that first he examine his conscience, bee sorry for his sins committed, humbly confesse them with a penitēt hart, & with this preparation to come to the cō

                  These of humilitie & reuerence to this holy misterie

haue spoken in deede of solemne preparation, which assuredly is meete, but frequenting of this holy communion is a most ancient custome, wherewith the church of Christ first sprange, as S. Luke the Euangelist in the Actes of the Apostles sheweth.

                  But in the Primitiue Church the feruentnesse of Christians was great, which when it is not now in vs, it seemeth more safe to abstaine from often communicating: for if it bee otherwise it is in daunger that we come not so disposed to communicate as wee ought. The safer way is, rather to be held then the lesse safe.

Sacrament, for by the benefit thereof, wee may both waxe hot, & be set on fire. For hee which is cold, ought rather to betake himself to the fire, thē he which is hot. So often as one humbleth himself before God, & hath a good intentiō there is no danger.

No other thing then to bee ashamed, and to account it a reproach, if thou art a good Christian, and indued with vertue, wherefore & worthily too, may Christ be ashamed to receiue thee into heauen.

And the often cōmunicating, doth not take away recreations, but doth allow thē, so they are lawfull & honest. In that thou sayst thy libertie is taken away, it is not true, for if thou dost thinke any thing forbidden lawfull vnto thee not Communicating, thou art deceiued, for whether thou communicate often or seldome, thou art bounde to abstaine from sins. He which for recreation offendeth his creator, looseth true liberty, when he maketh himselfe a seruant of sin, yea, he looseth true ioy, which springeth of a good conscience, & this the foolish world doth not vnderstand.

When the Son of God standeth and knocketh at the doore of thy hart, open vnto him, let him not knocke in vaine. To conclude, remember that the kingdome of heauen, suffereth violence, when we see, wee must labour to attaine the same.
