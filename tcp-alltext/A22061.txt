/ that as grete & as large powr to binde & to lose
was geuen of god to a simple preste as to a byshope
or to the bishope of Rome (which is more).
Which entēt & opinion (you saye) I proued by these
wordis of Christ saing. Go your ways in to the
worlde ād preache the Gospel &c. for as my father
hath sente me / so sende I you &c. Syr / firste ye shal
knowe that what so euer the scripture affirmeth / 
I holde it for no opiniō: but I beleue it to be true
for there is grete difference betwene faith & opiniō
And as for these textis which you saye that I alledged
to proue my entent / loke you whether they
make for your opinion of bindinge and losinge in
secrete confession aftir your vnderstādinge / or rather
to pertaine to the open preachinge of the worde
of God. And turne to Mark in the. 16. Chap. &
loke whether this your texte. Quia sicut misit me
pater &c. foloweth (as you allege it) Ite in mundū
vniuersum with a coniunction causale as you falsely
bringe it in to shewe the cause of the sentēce before.
But turne to Iohan cap. 20. & there shal you
se it stande with oute a Quia / as a propositiō first
propounded of Christ in a cōparison or similitude
ād aftirwarde there disposed / the cōparison declared
both in the geuinge of the holygost ād powr to
forgyue ād to holde sinnes. Nether dyd I allege
these textis as you do at rovers so confusely confoundinge
one Euangelist with a nother to confute
your false opinion / nor yet added I eny scilicetiu
plurali numero for Solomon warneth Prouer biorū.
30. that we adde nothinge to goddis worde leste
we be reproued & founde lyers. And Christe spake
his wordes in the plural nōbir at the geuinge of
his kayes to al his apostles: as ye maye se Ioh. 20
with oute eny scilicet / if you knowe a verbe of the
plural noumbir frome the singulare. But I passe

ouer your ignorāce / and shal prepare me to confirme
the truthe into the cōfutacion of your false opinions:
of the which. The firste is that a bishope or
the bishope of Rome (by whō you vnderstande the
Pope) hath a greter & larger powr to binde and to
lose geuen them of god then a simple preste. That
the truthe of goddis worde might be deliuerde frome
your false opinions aud losed frome your violente
wrestinge of holy scripture: & that it apereth
verily by your opinion / that you knowe not what
Christe ment bi the keyes of the kingdome of heauen
/ nether yet what is vnderstandē bi binding &
losing: ye shal knowe that when Christe asked his
disciples Matt. 16. Whō saie you that I am? Peter
(as the mouth of thē al) answered that thinge which
thei al beleued: euē thꝰ / Thou arte Christe the
sonne of the liuinge God. That thei al beleued thꝰ
as Peter openly confessed / the texte folowinge declareth.
For euen contenently he warned not only
Peter / but al them whō he asked the question that
thei shulde not tell eny mā that he was Jesus Christe.
This / Johan declareth in the. 6. chap. Vhere
Christe asked his disciples. And wil you go awaye
to? Peter answerde as the mouthe for them all.
Lorde / to whom shal we go? thou haste the wordis
of euerlastīge life / & we beleue (he said not I beleue
alone
                  ••
                knowe that thou arte Christe the sonne of
the liuinge god. Here Peter answerd for thē al the
same thinge that he cōfessed Mat. 16. vpō this therfore
so faithful a knowlege & beliefe sene in thē all
he promised thē Mat. 16. the keyes of the kīgdome
of heauen / for where he sawe like faith there wolde
he geue like office. And as Bede saith in the Homelie
of the same texte. Vvhē al were asked in general
Peter alone for al answerde / so that the same
thinge that Christe answerd Peter / he answerde

to them al in Peter / saing: Blessed arte thou Simon
bar iona &c. ād to the shal I geue the keyes of
the kīgdome of heauē that what so euer thou shalt
lose ī the erthe it shalbe losed in heauen: And what
so euer thou shalt binde in earth / it shalbe bounde
in heauē. That he promised thē al / these keyes it is
manifeste in the performinge of thē Johan. 20. ca.
Vvhere it is tolde when these keyes here promised
were geuen / to whō they were geuen / and what he
ment bi thē: Mark in the. 16. & Luc in the. 24. both
to telling the same storie. They were geuen the same
daye that Christe rose frome dethe at the caveninge
/ the disciples gatherd togyther in an house
for feare / the dores shitto thē. vnto whom Christe
entred in saluting them saing: Peace be with you.
But firste let vs se what christe mēt by these keyes

power wherby Pope bishope or preste holdeth and
absolueth the man that cōfesseth him into their cares
/ and of this power only (I dare saye) you vnderstonde
your opinion / and so accused me as aduersary
to it. But Master priour you shal vnderstande
that I mene no sich power by these keyes nether
Christe meaneth eny sith by them. For whē he
gaue them these keyes: he sente them not forth with
them to heare confessions / but to preach his gospell /

this is the keye that openeth the highe waye to the
kingdome of heauen / this openeth the dore of the
which Christe speaketh Johan. 10. thorow the which
dore who so euer entreth shalbe saued &c. And
for this cause Christe called his Gospel & holy worde
the keye of knowlege or keyes in the plural noumber
of the kingdō of heauen alluding vnto the
double propertye that one keye hathe both to open
and to shitte. Nowe sith the shitting vp of the kingdome

repentaunce. And at the preachinge of the
Gospel which promiseth remission of sinnes there
folowth faith which loseth the captiue cōscience in
to the quiet libertye of the spirit. Nowe had they
the worde delyuerde thē to be preached which he called
the keye of knowlege / nowe were they īspired

to thē / he sayd these are the wordis which I spake
to you while I was yet with you: for all muste
be fulfilled which were writen of me in the lawe of
Moses / in the prophetis and psalmis. Then opened
he their hartis that they might vnderstāde the
scriptures / the propertye of a keye is to open that
which before was shitte / thus doth Luce allude &
agre his speach with the propertys of a keye / for
before in the iourney to Emaus with the two disciples
he saith their eyes were shitte vp & holden so
that they knewe him not / but aftir he had rebuked
them for their vnbeliefe ād opened thē the scriptures
turning the keye of his worde in their hartis / 
the holygoste working with al / their eyes were opened
& thei knewe him. Here maye ye se in the storie
of Luce how with his worde he opened the hertes
of these two disciples yet locked vp in vnbeliefe
before they returned to Hierusalē vnto the other
xi. disciples. Nowe sayth he / euen as I was sente / 
that is to saye / to open mennis hartis losing them
with the keye of my knowlege frome vnbeliefe by
preachinge and expounding the scriptures / euē to
sende I you / he sente not only thē but hath seme

the holy goste breathed into them and turnīge the

               NOwe as touchinge your seconde opinion / whiche
you saie that I helde: That faith withoute
workes is sufficient / verely I neuer saide so:
but I might saie that by faith withoute workes a
man is iustified. Whiche is Paules sainge in the thirde
cap. to the Romās / and this sentence I beleue
as true with Paule / and holde it for nō opinion
And for a declaraciō of this Paules sentēce / I wil
firste tel you what is faithe / what it is to be iustified
before god / ād what is the rightwisnes of faithe.
Firste ye shal knowe that the Apostle defineth
faith in the. 11. ca. to the Hebrews saing that faithe
is the very suer & substancial beliefe of him whiche
is the same thinge that we hope fore: that is to saie
faith is an infallible & vndouted certaintye in our
hartes / wherby we beleue and truste in the inuisible
God: and to opene this definicion yet more plainely.
Faithe is that same cōstante and faste persuasion
in our hartes assuerde vs by the holygoste / certifyinge
vs of the goodnes of God and of his promises
towerde vs / by the which persuasion we beleue
verely his wordes and ar assuerde in our hartes
the holy goste testifinge it in vs) that he is our
God / our father / to vs an almighty helper and deliuerer / 
and that we are receyued in to his favour
by the dethe and meretis of his sonne Iesus Christe
our saviour / vpon the which beliefe ād assuered
persuasion we love him so ernestly agene that we
ceasse not the occasion and tyme offrede) to fulfill
his plesures in doinge the workes of loue or charite
to our neghbours. Of this lively faithe Paule
speaketh alwayes / which by love is mighty in operacion
ad Gala. 5. and mente no more deade faithe

he mente of a deade man / whē he alledged the prophete

God by this faithe / is nothinge els but to be absolued
frome sinne of God / to be forgeuen / orto haue
no sinne imputed vnto him of God.
               ¶The rightwysnes which is allowed before God
that cometh of faithe is sometimes in scripture called
his mercie or fauour towerd vs & in vs / wherby
he is moued for Christis bloudis sake to promise
vs forgeuenes. And sometimes it is takē for his
truthe & faithfulnes in the performīge of his promise
/ & of this is he called iuste or rightwise / faithful
and true. Vv

in the argument of the. 89. Psalme / and as Dauid
praieth God in the. 31. Psal. to deliuer him for
his rightwisnes sake: that is for his mercies sake
or for his truthes sake / & in the. 5. Psal. lorde ledemeforthe
for thy rightwisnes sake. The mercy wherby
God is moued to promise vs his benefits / 
goth before / and his truthe in performinge feloweth
/ nowe the maner of the scripture is / to vse the
one for the tother / as the kingdome of heauē for
the gospel which gothe before & is the knowlege of
the waye to the kingdome / and because of hearinge

in scripture is sometimes takē for to beleue / as
Iohan in the. 6. Euery man that hath harde and is
learned of my father cometh to me / that is to saye
euery man that beleueth on the father &c. & in the
same ca. He that cometh to me shalnot hōger / which
saing the sentence folowing expoundeth thus / 
He that beleueth in me shal neuer thirste or shalbe

& .10. ca. to the Ro. & ī the. 3. to the Philip. declareth
two maner of rightwisnesses: one he calleth the rightwisnes
of the lawe or our owne rightwisnes / &
the tother the rightwisnes of god or of faithe. the
rightwisnes of the the law is that at is gotē bi workes
of the lawe / the rightwisnes of faithe is that
wherby God of his mercie rekeneth vs righwise
for our faythes sake. Outwarde workes shewe vs
rightwise before the worlde / but faithe iustifieth
vs before God / Abrahams vtwarde dede in obainge
God and going forth to offer his sonne Isaac / 
Genesis. 22. and Iames. 2. was a testimony of his
faith / and declared him rightwise before men / aft

                  tir
the rightwisnes of the law. But here let men take
hede leste they despise the rightwisnee of faithe

                     •
                  s heresie / & stāde to the rightwisnes of their owne

workes. Of whō thꝰ speaketh Paule Ro. 10. They
ar ignorāt of the rightwisnes which is alowed before
God / & go aboute to stableshe their owne rightwisnes:
wherfore they ar not vnder the righwisnes
of God. There Paule (as I poynted you to before
bringeth in Moses / Leuiti. 18. & in Deutero. 30.
describinge these two rightwisnes / as one cōtrarie
to the tother. of the whiche descripciō I wil not
here tarye / rede the places ād Paules pistle to the
Ro. & to the Gala. & vnd
                     
                        
                     
                     er
                  stande it if god wil geue it
yowe. This is therfore Paules sentence to the Romans
in the thirde chapter. Vve suppose that a
man is iustified by faithe with oute the workes of
the lawe / vnderstanding it of iustificacion / and of
that rightwisnes that is of liuely faith ād alowed
before God / as I haue declared it before. And for
the probaciō of this sentence / the Prophetes / Christe
his awne selfe / and his Apostles spente al their
labours and liues / ād especially Paule labouring
above al other to confirme it / as it apereth in his
pistles / and especially in his pistle to the Romans.
Vvheryn he layed this sentence of the iustifyinge
by faith / at the beginninge as his principal proposition
and chefe foundation grounded of the testimonie
of Abaku
                     •
                   the Prophete. Agenste the which
proposicion / the Iwe whiche sought for the rightwisnes
of workes / as nowe do the false Christen / 
a non obiected saing / as you do nowe. If faith ōly
iustifieth / wherfore the is the lawe with so many
good workes cōmaunded vs to fulfil it? Paule answerthe / 
By the lawe come men in to the knowledge
of their sinnes. And because ye shulde vnd
                     
                        
                     
                     er
                  stand
that by the lawe he mēte the moral lawe / & not the
ceremonial. He gaue exāple ī the. 7. ca. of the moral
law saīg. I had not known that cōcupiscēse had bē sinne
except the law had saide. Thou shalnot luste

And nowe therfore (saith he Rom. 3.) the rightwisnes
of God is made manifeste with oute the lawe / 
by the Gospel frome faith to faithe / which rightwisnes
was sometime preached of the Prophetes / and
proued by the testimony of the lawe. And nowe a
                     •
                  
men iustified frely by Goddis mercy and by the redempcion
that is in Jesu Christe thorowe faith in
his bloude &c. Ro. 3. Then agene obiecteth the Iwe
as nowe dothe the Christē / in the beginnīge of the
4. ca. Vvhat thē shal we saye to Abrahā our father
aftir the flesshe: what gote he bi his workes? Vvas
he not iustified bi them? If Abraham (saith Paule)
were iustified by his workes / so hath he wherof to
reioyse / but not before God. And euen here is Iames
question soluted Iaco. 2. sayng. Abraham our
father / was he not iustified by his dedes when he
wolde haue offred his sonne Isaac? yes verely / as
here saith Paule / he had to reioyse before men but
not before God / that is to saye / he had that dede
which iustified him ād declared him iuste vtwardly
before men with the rightwisnes of the lawe for
his obedience: but as concerninge the rightwisnes
of 
                     〈◊〉
                   before God saith Paule Abrahā beleued
in God / and it was rekened him for rightwisnes.
This is Paules firste argument to proue his principal
proposicion: which argument he taketh of the
example of Abraham father of the peple of God.
In whom the forme of rightwismakinge was firste
declared and setforthe for our example. The seconde
argumente Paule deduceth of the diffiniciō
of th
                     •
                  s worde Vvas Rekened: which standeth in
the sayd autorite of Genes
                     •
                  s. 15. and it signifieth a
rekeninge & a fre forgeuenes of a dutye which the
dettour is not able to paye / sainge. To hī that worketh
is the rewarde not rekened of fauoure / but
of dutye: And to him that worketh not / but beleueth

on hī that iustifieth the vngodly. Faith is rekened
for rightwisnes (faithe sayth he ād not workes)
euen as Dauid sayth: Blessed is that man to
whome the lorde rekeneth not his sinne / he sayd
not blessed is he that worketh / but he to whō God
rekeneth not sinne / that is to saye / althoughe he be
a sinner and not able to come oute of dette: yet wil
not God of his mercy reken it vnto hym ne laye it
to his charge / for that the penitent sinner beleueth
that Christe made satisfaction for him ād payd the
raunsome for it with his preciouse bloude. And vpon
this fre forgeuenes he sealed him a quitaunce
with the seale of circumcision which was a tokē
to hī that he was iustified by his faith. But we haue
nowe a more suer ād liuelyer token of our right
wismakinge by faithe / for god hath confirmed vs
in Christe / he hath anoynted vs / he hath cōsegned
vs vnto him / and geuen vs his holygost for an erneste
of his promise to be iustified by faith. 2. Cor. 1
and Ephe. 1. thus sayng. Aftir that you harde the
Gospel which is the worde of truth wheryn ye beleued
/ ye were scaled with the holy spirit whiche
is to vs as an ernest peny to be assuerde of our promised
heretage / whiche is purchesed vs by redempcion
into the prayse of the glorie of God. Mo argumentes
Paule maketh in the same. 4. cap. to the
Romans / for the probacion of his sentence / espye
them oute if you can and desyer God to geue you
vnderstandinge. Also ye shal knowe that Christe
came not as a lawyer like Moses / but he was the
very redemer and reconcyler of the beleuers thorow
his bloude into his fathers fauour and grace.
The lawe was geuen by Moses / but remission of
sinnes and the holygoste is geuen by Christe / Iohan.

therfore let them loke before they leape. God
at the firste creacion griffed in to man and woman
as he hath done into all creatures a certayn secrete
natural properte to begete / to conceyue / & to bringe
forth a nother in like kinde & that lawfully with
honour. Whiche natural ordinaunce and property
it lyeth not in man to altere and to change / nor

febleyng their bodis: but the more they strived
agenste nature / the lesse they preuayled / & the
more burninge they suffred
                     •
                   and why? because thei
despised the remedy cōmaunded by gods worde to
be receyued / & wente aboute to heale their decease
with their owne workes and inuencions. God ordined
chaste matrimony as an holy and honeste remedie
for this natural burninge and vnlawful luste / 
cōmaunding by his Apostle. 1. Corint. 7. that if
thei cannot be continent & chaste / let them marye.
For it is beter to mary thē to burne. But your chirche
militāte beleueth it beter / to burne in al maner
of filthy cōcupiscens and luste / ye to liue in opē adultery
and sinne then to marye. And therfore vnder

the pretence of the setting vp and extolling of
their inordinat ordres: haue thei so obscured the glory
of honourable matrimonye whō they haue set
in siche despight ād opprobrie reputing it so vnpure
and vnclene / that it maye not be cowpled with
their holy ordres / ne celebrated in certaine of their
state holy times of the yeare withoute their dispensaciō.
They thought thorow the forbinding of matrimony
their prestes / to haue institute in their chirche
a more pure and cleaner state of perfectiō thē
euer God ordened / but to what a chaste ende theyr
holy porpose is come / euery man maie se / for al the
wealthe speke euel and shame of them / & euery mā
abhorre them for their pryde and vnclene liuinge.
But wherfore dyd your Chirche militant forbide
their prestes to marye? Because they were suer to
haue more avauntage by their adultery and horedome
then euer they shuld haue by their chaste matrimonye.
For if they had wiues then shuld not
the Bishopes / Cancelers / Commissares / Scribes
and somners be fed so fat with their adultery and
sinne as they are. If the prestes had wiues / then
shuld they haue a beter name ād fame / then shuld
the yoke ād 
                     •
                  ares of matrimony abate their pride
/ and encrese in them vertue and mekenes. But
paraventure they wil saie that the troublous sorowes
ād harefull state of matrimony shulde hindre
them frome preaching and teaching their parochians / 
naye verely / for nothing hath letted them more
frome that office / then their welthy ydle and vnchast
liuing and riches / and nothing shuld forther
it more then to haue experience of the crosse & trouble / 
nothīg more hindreth the worde then the preather
therof to haue an euel name: ād the moste parte
of them never preached nor taughte their flok
nor never shall / and emonge these fewe that preache

because they have no wiues: they destroye more
with their evell example of liuinge / then euer
they edified with their preachinge / which sclaunderouse
enormite might be reformed if they wolde
receyue that honourable ād holy remedie of chaste
matrimony ordined of god for them. Vvedlok
(saith the Apostle Hebre. in the. 13. cap. is honourable
for all men / he excepted none) and the chambre bed
vndefiled / but heremongers & adulterers god
wil iuge. If it be honourable for al men / how shulde
it dishonour prestes that lyue in perpetual burninge
and desier of other mennis wiues / seruātes
and doughters? Vvhy maye not chaste matrimony
agre withe your holy ordres? Is one sacrament
iniuriouse / harmeful or dishoneste to a nother?
Al your chirche militāt with their schole doctours
saye and affirme that the sacramētes geue grace to
the receyuers of them / and how then hapeneth it / 
that the holy ordrede prestes maye not receyue the
grace of matrimony? But (as I saied before) with
oute doute these forbyders of holy matrimony ar
of the secte of those heretiques that damned matrimony
as vnpure / beleuinge that it maye not be vsed
withoute sinne: of the whiche nowe ar those curates
which wil inioyne their parochiās that shalbe
maried / one not to knowe the tother (abusinge
Tobias exāple) in dayes aftir the celebraciō of the
sacramēt / & wil forbide maried persons to geue their
due beneuolēce (as Paule calleth it) to eche other
in lente & other of their holy tymes. These mē
doutelesse beleue that the acte and vse of matrimony
is sinne and iniuriouse or irreuerēt vnto the same
sacramente that maketh it holy / lawful & honourable:
these men know not the vertue & grace of
the worde of God / which maketh an holy ād chaste
acte of that which is sinne withoute the same worde

Paule. 1. Thessa. 4. cōmaundeth the Thessalontans
the holy and honourable vse of matrimony saing.
Let euery one of you knowe to possesse his vessel ī
holines & honour. Vvhich doctrine of Paule these
curates rather ought to instructe them: then to inhibit
them that thinge whiche the worde sanctifieth
and maketh honourable. Brīging the maryed people
into this errour and cōbraunce of consciens to
beleue that they sinne when they do wel / and to make
sinne there as nō is. But the blinde leadeth still
the blinde. Paule in his pistles bothe to Timothe
and Titus warned them that emonge al other
qualites and condicions belonginge to eny man to
be chosen preste or ouer seer of Christes flok / they
shuld se that he were a maryed man ād the man of
one wife / that is to saye a liuer in chaste matrimonye.
And wherfore cōmaunded Paule so diligently
this poynte of matrimony to be obserued? Verely
because he wolde haue them blamelesse / for he sen
                     •

al reuerence: then maye you suppose that the same
man shall also well instructe and teache an hole parishe
or towne. But if he cannot rule and gouerne
his owne house (saith Paule) how shal he teache
and take the charge and cure of the congregacion
of God? Paule saith. 1. Cor. 7. that maryed persons
that haue bodely troble / & what is trouble els but
to be caste in to the plesure of God to learne miche
vertue? The gouerning of his house is an introdu

Then muste he learne to beare the weaknes & siknes

of god as losse of goodis / dethe of his childerne

to be a schole & introduction into the spiritual cure
of an hole paresshe. But at this schole were neuer
our prestes ād bishopes / but rather brought vp in
courtlye welthe and luste &c. They haue formed
and reformed many yeres al other states ād other
mennis liuinges / vntil now they their selfe ar so
farre oute of frame / that no state or ordir hath more
nede of reformacion then they their selues. And

they wil not suffer it to come into light: but
god for his mercie redresse this wiked state. Amen.
¶It is not so lōge a go sith chaste matrimony was
forboden the prestes. For at the counsel of Nycene
(when they had wiues) where they wolde haue firste
separated and diuorsed them frome their wiues
There rose vp an holy man & cōfessour called Paphnucius
(loke in the decrees. 31. distinct. & in. 2. lib.
Ecclesiasti tripartite historie Epiphanio scholast
interprete cap. 14) which man said stiffly agēste it / 
affirminge that wedlok was honourable for almē
and that it is chastite / a man to holde hī to his owne
wife. And thus persuaded he the general counsel
/ that they shulde not laye siche a burden vpon
eny men / affirminge it to be grevouse. Vvhiche shuld
be the occasion of fornicacion & adultery both
to them that were then maryed ād to their wiues.
These wordes spake Paphnucius in the presens
of al the counsel: notwitstondinge yet he him selfe

was no maried man. And the counsel commended
and allowed his sentence / and decreed nothing as
concerning that matter at that time / but lefte it in
euery mannes libertye: but sith that time the chirche
as they saye hath forboden them to marye.
Here maye you se that other that counsel did a misse
and erred in approuinge it lawful for thē to haue
wiues or els the chirche that did forbide it: but
the counsel can not erre (saye they) wherfor then
the chirche erred that decreed the contrary? Of the
which Chirche thus prophecyed Paule in the. 4.
Chapter of the firste pistle to Timothe saing / that
in the later dayes some shulde departe frome the
faith / geuinge hede to sprites of erroure / and to

¶But these two maner of cōfessions presuppose a
penitent and a contrite harte hombled and vnfaynedly
confessed before god. Of the which maner of
confession Dauid speaketh in the. 32. Psalm / aftir
the Hebrew compte in the. 5. verse: I said / I shall
confesse my vngodlines which is agenste me to the
lorde / ād euen straite thou forgauest it me. Nether
is it Goddis lawe that mennis consciencis shuldbe
clogged with tellinge of al their sinnes that euer
they haue done in to a prestis care: which is impossible
for eny man to do. Whē Dauid saith Psal.
19. Vvho maye attayne to the knowlege of his sinful
nature? Vvhich Ieremie cap. 17. cōfirmeth sainge.
Shrewed and vnable to be serched is mannis
harte. Vvho can noumbre and tel al his sinnes
with so many circumstācis as the Popis lawe prescribeth
vs? and yet his disciples teache vs & preache
that we can haue no forgeuenes of our sinnes / 
except we confesse them into their eares. Vvhich
doctrine not only vexeth not a lytell many a good
simple consciens: but bringeth many for feare ād
shame into desperacion. If no sinne be forgeuen
with oute it be rehersed ād tolde them in theyr eares
as they teache vs / thē shal we neuer haue quiete
cōnsciencis. For we committe ful many ād they
to / which we can nether see nor remember. Also it
is no small iniurye to Christis bloude to attribute
the forgeuenes of our sinnes (as the
                     •
                   teache) to the

yet to stable she their combrouse confession they ar
not ashamed to abuse the holy scripture changing
the truthe (as Paule saith to the Romās in the firste
Chapter) in to a lye / takinge for them this place
of Mattheu in the. 8. Chapter / wher Christe commaunded
the man healed of his leprye to go & shewe
him selfe vnto the preste. Vvhich place maketh
playne agenste them. For the man was hole and
cleane bothe bodye and soule before he bad him go
for his faith firste had purified his harte / and then
Christe healed his bodye / for Christis cures were
perfite in healinge the hole man. Nowe this man
healed / Christe bad him go shewe him selfe to the
preste / he had him not go and shriue him selfe to
the preste. He had him go shewe his skinne & bodye
For the prestis office was to iuge & to decerne whether
the leprye was gone or not / and to dispose
the offringe for the clensinge of the sore / and to haue
a good porcion therof for his duty / as ye maye

                  ci in the. 13. and. 14. Chapter / ād as the
terte folowing in Mattheu declareth / if you wolde
diligently note it and conferre the lawe and the
Gospell to gither and remember that Christe sayd
he came not to breke Moses lawe / but to fulfil it.
Christe therfore wolde not defraude them of their
dutye / nether be preiudice vnto their office / leste
they shulde haue accused him of breakinge of Moses
lawe / for they honted for siche occasions faste
ynoughe to bringe him a waye / ād therfore he had
the man now healed go shewe him selfe to the preste
that the preste might haue his priuilege in the
iugement of the clensinge of the leprye / adding to
this commaundement / that he shulde offer the gifte.

                  fred (for this
was that morsel that the couetuouse preste gaped

so gredely for) and Christe wolde not the preste to
be disapoynted of his proye / adding also these wordes.
In to a testimony to themselfe / that is / to testifie
to the prestis hartis / that althoughe they hōted
to take him as breaker of Moses lawe / yet here in
this cure they might wel see hī obserue it into their
owne cōdemnacion / if they did other wise accuse hī
as eny transgressour therof / as they dyd not with
standinge at the laste / their owne consciencis witnesinge
agenste them. And euen of the violēt wrestinge
and false interpretinge of this one texte to
serue for our spiritual belyes and their ambiciouse
impery men maye gather and see plainly many
other placis and textis of holy scripture to be like
wise peruerted and torne in to their tradicions.
But God avenge & deliuer once his pure holy worde
frome the captiuite of these pestelent skorners &
gloriouse glosing hipocritis. Amen.
            
            
               ¶Of pilgrimages and worshiping of
Images.
               THen you saye that I wolde haue men in derision
that wente on pilgrimage / for what cause
it came not then into your minde / loke & you can
call the cause yet into your minde / & who tolde you
this / for I can tell you full well / ād who cōspired
with you to obserue me & to write my sainges & to
cōceyue siche secrete letters / but the lorde will se to
it & avenge Exo. 5. Sir I mocked thē not / but he
that sitteth in heauen hath thē in derisiō. It is the
lorde that scornethe thē Psal. 2. and that worthely
because they forsake him the liuinge god alone for
all sufficient / and euer ready to helpe all that call
vpon him in faith and verite / and will runne aftir
straunge goddes / into hilles / wodes and solitary
places / there to worshipe stockes & stones / ye & patauēture
to do worse thinges) of mānes making.

Ar not these men to be laughed at / or rather to be
lamented / that maye ād oughte to worshipe god at
home in their chamber / and yet will farsake / wife
/ childerne and housholde (whose presens they
behoue) and spende both bodye and goodes in longe
and wearye trauelinges to fall downe and worshipe
a stocke or a stone made with mannis hande?
Are not these the people scatred so brode thorowe
al the lande of Egypte to seke chaffe? Exodi in the
5. chapter. Reade the seconde precepte as it standeth
Exodi in the. 20. chapter / reade the lawe / the
Prophetes and the newe testament / and loke howe
greuously God threateneth these godgoers ād
saincte sekers that shulde have but one God / him
only to honour and to serue / as Christ testified in
the. 4. chapter of Mattheu / and that in spirit and
truthe euen at home in their hartes. Stāde it not
writen Exodi in the. 22. chapter. He that offereth
to eny Goddis / that is to saye vnto eny image / save
vnto the lorde only: let him dye with oute redemption?
He abhorred straunge goddes so sore / 
that he forbade his people to name them / Exod. in
the. 23. Chapter. Heare what I saie saith in the .65
chapter: I haue stretched forth my handes al this
longe time paste vnto a nacion that forsaketh me / and
seketh straunge goddes / which nacion gothe
not the right waye / that is to saye not aftir my
minde and commaundementes. Vvhich nacion exaspereth
and angreth me beynge present / and yet
go they forth / to offre in groues and wodes / doinge
sacrifices there at autares of stone / sittinge and
knelinge by toumbes and shrynes / sleaping in chirches
full of images: let the schole men excuse this
falling dome before Images kissinge of their fete / 
kneling / praing / holding vp of hādes / steking vp
of candles / and geuinge them giftes / &c. callinge

for their helpe in sikenes ād perel making their vowes
vnto them. Let them cloke their worshipe
with Dulia and Hyperdulia and yet shal it be Idololatria / 
when they haue made the beste for them
that they can. God will not be worshiped with our
inuencions / but as he him selfe hath commaunded
he forbode euen the making of Images. For he se
that they shulde steale a waye his worshipe. Thus
said he Isaie in the. 42. chapter: I am he that is called
the lorde: which geue not my glory to eny other
creature nether yet my prayse to eny karuen Images.
Except you be ashamed of your stockes and▪
Idoles in wodes and hilles / in whom you delighted
and leaue your groues and gardens / which ye chose
for your selues / you shalbe like okes whole
leaues fall a vaye and like a garden with oute water.
For the glistering glorie of these Images shal
be turned into stubble / and the makers of them in
to sparkes of fyer / and both of them shalbe burnte
vp to gither noman quenchinge them Isaye in
the firste chapter. Reade him also in the ende of the
seconde chapter. And heare what the Prophet Baruch
saith of these Idolotres in the. 6. cap. Th

But wherfore wolde you not that eny creature shuld
