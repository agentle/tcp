               WHere of late order hath ben geuen by the Quenes
Maiesties commaundement, to sundry portes of
this Realme, to vnderstande what nombre of
shyps are belonging to the same, & to commaund
certayne of them not to be vnreadye for the seruyce
of the Realme, vppon anye occasion that
might seme necessary: It is vnderstand that some
French vessels beyng prepared to the warre, and
commyng into certayne of the sayd portes, haue
ben vppon some suspicion stayed.
            Wherefore her Maiestie hath thought necessarye to notifie vnto all maner her
Subiectes, that although indede suche commaundement was geuen by her Maiesties
Admyrall, that certayne shyppes in dyuers Portes should remayne in readines
for such seruice as should be necessary for the suretie and defence of the Realme, which
thyng also her Maiestie would should so continue, vntyll it may appeare to what end
the great preparacions of Fraunce do tende. yet neuerthelesse her Maiestie meanyng
and desyryng moste earnestly to haue the peace and concorde noryshed betwyxte
her Realmes & Fraunce: Wylleth and strayghtly chargeth all her Subiectes to permit
al maner the French kynges subiectes to haue theyr entrecourse with theyr shyps
and vessels in her Portes, in lyke case as in all tymes of peace hath ben accustomed.
            
               Yeuen at Westminster vnder her Maiesties signet the .vi. of Ianuary, the
seconde yere of her reigne.
