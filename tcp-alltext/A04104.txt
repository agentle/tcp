                  WHereas for preuention of ſuch diſorders, ryots and rebellions within this Realme, as might grow by looſe and diſloyall people, hauing meanes to arme themſelues, to doe miſchiefe againſt his Maieſtie and the Common wealth, diuers Proclamations haue beene heretofore publiſhed by the late Lo: Deputies and Councell of this Kingdome, cōmanding that no Maſter or owner of any Ship, Barque, or any Merchant, Factor, or other Tradſeman, nor any other perſon or perſons whatſoeuer, denizen or ſtranger, ſhould bring or cauſe to be brought into this Kingdome or any part thereof, without ſpeciall licence from the Lords of the Councell in England, or from the Lord Deputy and Councell here, any quantity or quantities of Gunpowder, or any Muſkets, Calliuers, Hand-gunns, Piſtols, or other Peeces, Morrions, Head-peeces, Armors, or any other furniture for the warres (Swords and Rapiers, and Sword and Rapier blades onely excepted) vpon paine of his Maieſties diſpleaſure and indignation, and vpon p

And Wee being now againe informed that the ſaid Proclamations haue of late beene little regarded, but that great quantities of Powder, Armes, and other warlike munition of all kindes haue beene daily brought into this Kingdome from forraine parts, and ſale thereof made to all ſorts of people, without reſpect of perſons, ſo as many looſe

               earnes, and idle perſons of bad and lewd behauiour, being furniſhed and armed with powder, peeces and othe

                warlike weapons, doe not onely make great ſpoile and hauocke of red and fallow Deere, and other game within the proper lands of ſundrie Noblemen and Gentlemen of this kingdome, but are thereby the rather imboldned to commit diuers inſolent ryots, burglaries, robberies and murders, and many times to runne into open action of rebellion, to the great diſturbance of the publike peace and trouble of the State and Common-wealth of this Kingdome: By meanes whereof, greater miſchiefes and inconueniences may happen in this Realme, if due care and circumſpection bee not ſpeedily had for preuenting the ſame. And although after ſo many warnings giuen, Wee may iuſtly call ſuch perſons to account as haue offended againſt the ſaid Proclamations, by impoſing the vtmoſt penaltie that by the Tenor of the ſame might be inflicted vpon them for their wilfull contempt againſt his Maieſtie and the State in that behalfe: Yet hoping that by the renewing of the ſaid former Proclamations once more, the ſame will from henceforth be more ſtrictly obſerued and kept then heretofore it hath beene, We therefore doe againe in the name of the Kings moſt excellent Maieſtie, declare, publiſh, and command, That no Maſter or owner of any Ship or Barque, or any Merchant, Factor, or other tradeſman, nor any other perſon or perſons whatſoeuer, denizen or ſtranger, ſhall from henceforth bring or cauſe to be brought into this Kingdome, or any part thereof, (without ſpeciall licence from the Lords of the Councell in England, or from Us the Lord Deputie and Councell of this kingdome) any quantitie or quantities of Gunpowder, or any Muſkets, Caliuers, Handguns, Piſtols, or other Peeces, Murrions, Head-peeces, Armours, or other furniture for the Warres (Swords and Rapiers, and Sword and Rapier blades onely excepted) vpon paine of his Maieſties diſpleaſure and indignation, and vpon paine of ſeyſure and forfeyture of the ſame, whereof the one moytie ſhall be to the vſe of the Kings Maieſtie, and the one halfe of the other moytie to be for the Officer of his Maieſties Store, where the ſame be ſeiſed, and the other moytie, and halfe of the aforeſaid moytie, to be giuen to him who ſhall diſcouer and ſeiſe the ſame, or the value thereof, according to his Maieſties rates. And We doe further in his Maieſties name declare and publiſh, That if any merchant, factor, or tradeſman, or any other perſon or perſons within this Realme, now haue or at any time hereafter ſhall happen to haue any quantitie or quantities of Gunpowder, or any Muſkets, Caliuers, handguns, or other Peeces, Murrions, head-peeces, Armour, or other abiliments of warre (Swords and Rapiers, and Sword and Rapier blades excepted) in his or their hands or poſſeſſion, to the intent to ſell the ſame or any part thereof to any perſon or perſons, that then ſuch merchant, factor, or other perſon or perſons, within one moneth after the date of this Proclamation, or within one moneth after the ſaid powder or munition; ſhall come to his or their hands ſhall vpon paine of ſeiſure, and forfeiture thereof, and vpon paine of his Maieſties diſpleaſure and indignation, bring or cauſe to bee brought all ſuch powder, and other munition, into one of his Maieſties Stores of Ordinance and munition, whereupon Wee the Lord Deputie and Councell ſhall from time to time take order, and prouide that the Officers of his Maieſties Ordinance and munition ſhall receiue the ſame, and the Owner or Owners thereof immediately vpon the deliuerie thereof into his Maieſties Store, be fully ſatisfied and pa

               ed for the ſame, at ſuch rates and prices, as the Maſter of the Ordnance hath vſually iſſued the ſame. Prouided alwayes that it ſhall and may be lawfull to and for euerie Citie or Towne corporate within this Realme, to retaine and keepe within their ſeuerall Stores, ſuch powder or munition for the neceſſarie defence of the ſaid Cities and Townes Corporate, ſo as the ſaid corporations doe within fortie dayes after the date hereof, certifie Us the Lord Deputie and Councell, what quantitie or quantities of powder or other munition they and every of them haue now in their Stores, and ſo as they nor any of them doe not iſſue the ſame nor any part thereof by way of ſale. And We doe further declare and publiſh. That if any Nobleman, Gentleman, or perſon of honeſt and good behauiour, or if any Citie or Corporation, or any Owner or maſter of Barque or Ship going to Sea, ſhall haue occaſion to vſe any reaſonable quantitie of powder, or any muſkets, Calliuers, or other furniture of Warre, That euery ſuch perſon and perſons, and euery ſuch Citie, Towne or corporation, ſhalbe from time to time, by the warrant of the Lord Deputie, or by the warrant of the ſeuerall Preſidents of the prouinces of Munſter and Connaght, or of other Commanders or gouernors within their ſeuerall commands, furniſhed and ſupplyed of any ſuch competent quantitie of powder or munition as he or they ſhall deſire to vſe, at ſuch reaſonable and eaſie rates as his Maieſtie doth vſually iſſue the ſame to his Armie within this land. And We doe hereby expreſly charge and command all and euery gouernor and gouernors, Mayors, Soueraignes, Portriffes, Bayliffes, Conſtables, and all Cuſto
                  •
               ers, Searchers, and Councellers, within all and euery the Ports, Hauens and Creekes of this Realme, and all other his Maieſties Officers and miniſters to whom it may appertaine, That they and euery of them doe from time to time vſe and imploy their beſt diligence and endeuours to diſcouer and leiſe to his Maieſties vſe as aforeſaid, ſuch quantities of powder, muſkets, Calliuers, hand guns, Peeces, and other munition and furniture of warre, as ſhall be brought into this Kingdome or any part thereof, to be ſold to any perſon or perſons, or which any merchant, factor, or other perſon or perſons ſhall deteyne and keept in his hands or poſſeſſion, to the intent to ſell the ſame, contrarie to the purport of this Proclamation, and that herein they fayle not to performe their duties, as they will anſwere the contrarie at their perils. Prouided alwayes, that it ſhall not be lawfull for any perſon or perſons whatſoeuer, wearing any Iriſh ma
                  •
               tle or Trowſes, to vſe, carrie or keepe any muſket, Calliuer, hand-gun, Piſtoll, or other Peece or Peeces, nor to haue or vſe any gun-powder, nor to weare, carrie or keepe any murrion, head peece, Swordes, Rapiers, Skeynes, or any other armes whatſoeuer inuaſiue or defenſiue, upon paine to forfeyt the ſame to his Maieſtie. And that it ſhall be lawfull for euerie Nobleman, Gentleman, or other perſon of honeſt and good behauiour, conforming him or themſelues vnto the Engliſh faſhion of apparell, to ſeize and take away the ſame, and the ſame ſo ſeized and taken away, to carrie to the next Iuſtice of the peace, to the intent the ſame may be deliuered into his Maieſties next magazin or Store-houſe of the munition and armour in thoſe parts, or to ſuch perſon or perſons as ſhall haue ouerſight or command of the ſame.
            And whereas many times heretofore inſtructions haue beene giuen, aſwell to the Lords Preſidents in the ſeuerall Prouinces, as to the Juſtices of Aſſize in their ſeuerall circuites and ſeſſions, for aboliſhing the vſe of Iriſh apparell, & the reducing of all men to vſe a ciuill and comely attire, according to the Lawes and Statutes of this kingdome: Yet although they haue (according to the ſaid inſtructions) indeuoured to take away the barbarous cuſtome of wearing Mantles, Trowſes, Skeynes, and ſuch like vnciuill and vncomely apparell, We ſee notwithſtanding the vſe of them rather increaſed then any wayes reformed or abated, euen to this day, to the great contempt of authoritie, and the diſgrace of this kingdome among other ciuill nations. For reformation whereof, We haue thought fit hereby once more to giue all men notice, that as his Maieſtie hath often recommended the care of the redreſſe of the ſaid barbarous cuſtome unto Us, and aboliſhing the vſe of ſuch vnſeemely apparell, ſo now W
                  •
                intend to inflict the vtmoſt penaltie of law vpon ſuch as from and after the time hereby preſcribed ſhall preſume eyther to weare the ſaid barbarous attire, or to ſuffer any within their family or rule to weare and vſe the ſame, contrary to the Lawes and Statutes of this Kingdome, And doe therefore hereby ſtraightly charge and command, That from and after the firſt day of Auguſt next no Man doe weare any Mantle, Trowſes, or long Skeynes, nor doe ſuffer any to be worne by any within his family, gouernement or rule but by the time aforeſaid doe attire themſelues, their children, ſeruants, and followers in ſuch comely manner as the ciuilleſt ſubiects of this kingdome now vſe to doe: In default whereof, they are to expect no fauour, but to be proceeded againſt for their wilfull and obſtinate contempt in the ſeuereſt maner that by the Lawes and Statutes of this kingdome may be taken againſt them, and beſides ſuch other puniſhments to be inflicted vpon them, as the Law doth impoſe. We hereby charge and command, That no perſon which from and after the time aforeſaid, ſhall weare or vſe any Iriſh apparell or weapon ſhall preſume to come, nor ſhalbe admitted to haue acceſſe or audience to or at the Councell table, or in any Court of Juſtice in this kingdome, nor before any Judge or Magiſtrate, vpon any matter or cauſe of priuate complaint whatſoeuer. And Wee doe likewiſe hereby ſtraightly commaund all Sheriffes, Prouoſts, marſhals, and other Officers, that as they ſhall finde any man that after the ſaid day ſhall weare any ſuch long Skeyne, to take the ſame and breake them, And ſuch men as they ſhall finde wearing of Mantles or Trowſes out of their owne houſes, to take the ſame from them, and before their faces to cut them into peeces, that they neuer be worne againe. Of the erecution whereof, Wee require the ſaid Sheriffes and prouoſt-marſhals, and other his Maieſties Officers, to be verie carefull, as they will anſwere the contrarie and their neglect or remiſſeneſſe therein. Prouided alwayes, that it ſhall and may be lawfull to or for any perſon or perſons to vſe or weare any Mantle within his or their houſes, notwithſtanding any thing in this Proclamation, to the contrarie.
