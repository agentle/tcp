Of this Churche are the poore in spirite, the true penitent, the meeke harted, the mercifull, the pure and cleane minded, the peacemakers.Math. v.

Of thys Church are thei, that both obserue the cōmaundements of Christ thē selues, and teache others also to do the lyke, who vnderstanding the law spiritually (accordyng to the Lordes interpretacion) declare them selues to be the perfect childrē of God, in louing their enemies, blessing those that cursse thē

And thoughe they babble not much in theyr prayers (as the Hethen doo) and are assured that theyr heauenly Father dothe knowe what thinges thei haue nede of, afore they aske of him: Yet being taught of the Lord, how, vnto whom, and what to pray, they most obediently folowe his order: forgiuing others theyr offē

Of thys Church are they, that gather them selues treasure together, not vpon earthe, but in heauen, wher neither rust nor mothes

corrupt, & wher theues nether breake vp nor steale. These dependyng vpon the only prouidence of God, though they▪ abhorring idelnes, do faithfully labour and trauaile euery one in their vocation? the hādes working, the eies looking, the mouth speaking, the fote going. &c. yet take they no vnlawfull care or thought for this life: but fyrste seke the kingdom of God, & the righteousnes therof, and so enioye at his hand, the rich prouision of al necessary thinges with a good conscience.

Of this Churche are the good trees▪ that oute of the good treasure of the heart, bring furth good fruitfull thinges. As thei that beynge ware of false prophetes, and herkening onely vnto

It is the Lordes only voice that thei herken vnto, and hym they followe, who knoweth them, and geueth them eternal life: so tha they shal neuer perish, neither shal any manne plucke them out of his hand. The father of heauen, who hath geuen this holye flocke and Congregation vnto Christ his sone, is greater then al, and no man is able to plucke them out of his heauenly fathers hande. Nowe is God the father and Christ his sonne all one, to the endles comforte of this his vniuersal Church.Psa. xxxii. This flocke of Christ, this holy congregation, is that blessed Church,Rom. iiii. whose vnrightousnes is forgeuen, and whose sinnes are couered, and not imputed: Yea in this Church hath the Lord himself ordayned & appointed the heauēly ministracion of continuall remission and forgeuenes of sinnes, to al such as vnfainedly

Yet a good tre mai be knowne by his fruts.Mat. vii. Like as the beames then that procede of the Sūne, are testimonies and partakers of the lyght therof: Euen so, what church or congregation soeuer professeth the name & Religiō of Christ, hauyng and exercising the pure and sincere doctrine of hys Gospel, of his Sacraments, and of al his dissipline, accordyng to his holye institutiō, ye same do we take vndoutedly for Christs church.Mat. xii.vii.

If the authoritie of the said holy vniuersal and catholike churche of Christ, had not wholly & fully moued, stirred & prouoked, admonished and taught vs so to do.Cōtra epistolam fundamenti. cap. v. But whan we considered (with S. Augustine) the estimation and dignitie, the worthines and authoritie of the sayde, vnyuersal

                  sailes that it geueth vs, and to folowe the instructions, lessons and ensāples that it sheweth vs. For sure we be (as we haue cōfessed alredy) that the foū
                  dation of this Church is fyrme & fast. Herein hath the Lord set vp his owne lyght, that hath no darknes in it.Iohn. xii. Here is the truth that desceiueth no man, the lyfe that kylleth no man, and the kynges hye way that bringeth euery man righte to his iourneies ende. As for a perticuler mā,Psa. xxvi. Roma. iii. Iaco. iii. a perticuler church or Congregation (as we sayd before) they maye erre, thei may be disceiued in one thyng or other, at one tyme or other. The consideration wherof (as it

appeareth) did moue S. Augustine, to haue most prīcipal regard to ye church vnyuersall, although the particuler churches of Aphrica in his time, were not defiled and poysoned, as they be nowe. O that mē were so circumspect this day, as to builde vppon so sure a ground. For though we maye safely geue credence to ani perticuler church whan it followeth the wholesome doctrine, wherin the holy gost by his Apostle, did stablish the Churche of the Ephesians, of the Philippians, of the Colossians, of the Tessalonians. &c. Yet if any such Church do shute at another marke, we shall but loose oure game in doyng therafter.
               As (for ensample) what sound doctrine, what wholsome religion, what good and vpright discipline, is there at this present day, in any of the said particular Churches? Be they not vtterlye corrupted and poysoned with diuers kindes of horrible idolatrye, with shameful supersticious, with dā

Mat. xxviii might become his disciples, & be taught to obserue al thinges whatsoeuer he hathe commaunded. For in consideraciō of this most gracious

purpose, he did not onlye geue vnto his Apostles and Disciples, the holy Ghost,Iohn. xx. and opened theyr wittes that they might vnderstand the scriptures, but also cōmitted vnto them, & to theyr succession in his Church, the office and charge of preaching repentaunce and remission of sinnes in hys name among al nacions.Luk. xxiiii. For this intent also hath it pleased him, to constitute, and ordaine diuers and sondrye Ministers:Roma. xii. some hauyng one charge, some another:i.

For the holye Gost (who glorifyeth his owne ordinaunces with his blessed presēce) and also the word it selfe assureth vs, that nothing, though it be outward & external

(appointed and appertainīg to the right, whole and perfect vse of Gods holy sacramentes) is in vaine, or but a bare signe, for asmuch as when the minister doth execute the Lordes wil according to his holy ordinaunce, in the ministration of the visible Sacramēt by an outward action. The holy gost not only certifieth the faithful

               O worlde howe mad, o man howe blinde art thou? that seest not this precious

treasure, and taistest not the incomparable swetenes and moste heauenly comfort of this greate mistery betwene Christ and his cōgregation▪
                  Ephes, v. Thou gnawest vpon the harde shelle, but vpon the swete kernel wherein is spirit and life, thou fedest not. Wolde God, his truth coulde perswade vs, yt to be worthy pertakers hereof, is thorowe fayth by the operatiō of the holy gost, to be assured and fully certified, that followyng also the Lords will in the outward actions of his holy ordinaunces, and framynge our lyues, accordyng to his wholsome doctrine taught vs therein, we haue vndoubttedly the thinge that ther is promised which is euerlasting lyfe in his bodye and bloude.
               For first, as concernyng fleshe and bloude, we were in felowshippe with Christ, in the loynes of our forefather Adam,Gene. iii. to whom he was promised immediatly after his offence, but opened vnto the worlde, whan he became incarnate:Heb. ii. So that this felowship was entred with vs, in that parte whyche

was properli ours. In respect wherof the father of heauen (through fayth & operation of his holy spirit) vouchsafe to make vs partakers, of that whiche was properly his: namely the breade that came downe from heauen, which is lyfe it self, optained by Christes death, whereby his merites are become ours. So that then was this felloweship fully ioyned, whan the heauenly mariage betwene our nature and his was made, in the vnitie of persone in him, & not by cōfusiū of substance no more thē ether his deuine or humayn nature is confounded, thoughe he be both very God and very man. Thus thorow faith (wherunto this heauenly matter is offered) and by the workyng of the holy gost, we haue our felowship with euerlastynge life, in his body and bloud, which he tooke of vs and which now sitteth in glory, wher also our soule is present through faith so that we be one with him.
               The fruitful knowledge and vnderstandyng of this heauenly mistery, is euidently setfurth to the eyes of faith▪
                  
not onely by the fyrst institution and practise of ye Lordes holy Supper, but also by his most comfortable wordes afore in the Gospel,Iohn. vi. where he sayth: it is God the father, that doth graūt vs, his true bread, namely his owne sōne which came downe from heauen, and geueth life vnto the world. For he only deserued, that the father should geue vs agayne, this lyfe that was loste.
               And like as the sonne sayth, that the father should geue vs the breade that came from heauen, that is to saye, his owne sonne (whō he also calleth lyfe, because he is the life it selfe:) Euen so the sōne saith, that the bread which he wold geue,Iohn. vi. shuld be his flesh which he would geue and offre to the father for the lyfe of the worlde: Namely, that the worlde by his death, myght haue that lyfe, whyche he sayde, the father woulde geue: and that is euen the very true breade that came downe from heauen. So yt in the Gospel, the sōne touchynge his deuinitie which came from heauen, is called bread: And like wyse his vmanitie whiche he offered vp vpon the crosse, he calleth bread.
               
                  Thus through faythe, we haue the perfourmaunce of that whiche was promised, namely, of ye deuine nature which is life after a more aboundaūt sort, then it was lost in Adam:i. Iohn. i. i. Corin. 
                        •
                     . Ephes. v. So that this is, and may wel be called a verye felowship: and so in dede both Saynt Iohn and S. Paule termeth it.
               The worthy Sacrament of the body and bloude of the Lorde, was instituted only by himselfe, in the Parler wher thei did eate the Easter lambe, the same night wherin he was betraied. And as cōcernyng the maner how the Lord and thei that receiued it with him, did vse it: Howe he also himselfe willed others his deputies and ministers of his congregation and church to do the same (for whom like wyse, & for what intent and purpose he did institute & ordayne it) it is sufficientlye mencioned by the thre Euangelistes and by the Apostle Paule.Mat. xxvi Mar. xiiii Luke. xxii. i. Cor. xi. Touching the which we must consider, that forasmuch as Christ did institute this to be a Sacramente, and taughte by his most worthy worde and practife, a ce

ordre in the ministration therof. Therfore as the thynges therein contained, ought Sacramentally to be vnderstand, without anye absurditie, or interruptynge either of the action or mistery. So if the ordre and fourme by him prescribed, and commaunded to be vsed (by suche as are appoynted for the ministratiō therof) be omitted Then is that no Sacrament of his.
               For Sacramentes are as substancial couenauntes & agremētes, whose nature is to declare vnto vs, some righte, title, priuiledge or gifte, that we haue or shal receiue thereby: whether thei be grounded vpon a commen custome, or commaūded to be obserued, by such as haue authoritie to make a lawe or ordinaunce for the same. For whi should the ordre prescribed in this holy Sacramēt, be worse kept, or lesse obserued, then was the rule that God appoynted in the Sacramentes of the olde lawe? Their sacramentes had orders, which wer kept: and whi should not the rules of our Sacramentes be obserued likewyse?
               
                  Circumcision had a prescribed day what persons should be Circumcised,Gen. xvii and what part of the fleshe shoulde be cutte away. &c. The Lorde callinge it both his couenaunt, and the token of his couenaunt.
               The celebration of Easter, had like wise of the Lorde a time appointed,Exod. xii. in the which euery houshold, hauynge a lambe or a kydde of one year olde, being a Male without blemishe, should slaye him: And not onely take & strike the bloude of him vpon the two syde postes, and on the vpper doorepost of the house,, but also eate the lambe (or kydde) the same nyght, with vnleauened bread, and with sower herbes, nether rawe nor sodden in water: but rosted at the fyre, the head, the feete, and purtenaunce together, with theyr loynes gyrded, shooes on theyr feete, sta

               And diligently is this to be noted:

Namely, that lyke as ye fathers in olde time did faythfully obserue and kepe the sayde rules, nether omyttyng any of them, nor minishyng theim, nether addyng ought vnto thē that the Lord himself, had not appoynted,: Euen so albeit that the cuttynge awaye of the fores

Where as is likewise to be noted, that thei do horribly abuse the Sacrament of baptisme, that ether mynishe

from it anye of the rules prescribed by the Lord himselfe, or adde ther vnto, their owne rites and supersticions, whether it be salt, spittle, creme, oyle, or any such thinges as may deface the worthines of Christ. Yet hath there no suche mischaunce happened vnto this holy sacrament, as ether to teach or beleue, that ther is any transsubstanciatiō of the water in baptism, or that it looseth the nature of water, though it be appointed and turned to a very holy vse.
               Nowe to returne agayn to our purpose: The worthy Sacrament of the

it may not be, nor left vndone, but vsed in due time accordingly, and in suche sorte, as is appointed by the word of God,mat. xxvi. Luke. xx. i. Cori. xi. who saith: ☞Take ye, eate ye, drincke ye al of it: Do this, in the remembraunce of me. And by his Apostle, he hath geuen this ordre, that we whiche mynde to be partakers of this holy Communion, shall haue no contencion nor strife amōg our selues but refourme our abuses: commynge here vnto, not onely together, but also after a better sort,What things ar requyred afore the holy communion. rather then after such euil wyse, as we happlye heretofore haue done: One to tarye for another without disdayne, and (afore we eate of this bread and drinke of thys cuppe) to proue, try, and examine our selues, our myndes and consciences, our wordes and dedes: callynge oure whole lyfe and conuersation earnestly to remembraunce, lamentyng and confessyng our sinnes vnto God callyng vpon him for mercy, conuerting vs whollye vnto him, knittynge our selues together in the vnitie of fayth, and godly loue: and so to come to the

holy Sacrament: Where first the minister, takyng the bread, geuyng thankes & breaking it, ought by the Lords ensample, to deliuer it vnto other,The order to be kepte at ye holye cō

               This is nowe the ordre, appointed to be obserued at the ministration of this holy sacrament,The name of thys holy Sacrament. i. Cor. x.xi which the scripture calleth ☞ the Supper of the 
                     •
                  ord the Communion (or felowship) of the body and bloud of Christ. Cōcerning the which, if the Lorde had authoritie to make a lawe, or to set an ordre, for the due ministration and vse thereof. Then we also that be his subiectes, ar boūd to obserue the same: and nether to ad ought therto, cōtrary vnto it, nether to minish or take away frō it, ani thinge that he hath wylled vs to vse: Or els, we playnly disapoynt our selues,

of the ryghte title and possession of such comfortable commodities, as we, by vertue of this heauenlye couenaunt and bargayne, shoulde elece be sure of. For as this is a special gift, appointed by the last wyl and testamēt of our Sauior Christ, who in the true ministration of this his holye sacrament (by the operacion of this blessed spirite) hath promised to make iust deliueraunce of the thing promysed, So is it by him condicioned afore hand, that we shal duly receiue and vse the same: and not to eate of the breade, or drincke of the cup of the Lord vnworthely,i. Cor. xi. to our owne damnation.
               In Ciuile causes the like order taketh place. Where a leace is made, it must not only be signed, sealed, & deliuered, but also receiued, and the partie put in possession: Not deliuered (I say) by euery man, but only by hym or his deputie, that hath authority to make or geue the leace: neither maye euery man receiue and ēnioye it, saue only he, to whom it is made or geuē, or that hath ryght thereto. Agayne, a

leace cōmonly is not made wythout condicions: whych if they be broken, doth not ye farmer thē forfeit his leace?
               And what meane we els by thys, but euen to shew that it is an horrible thing, & farre out of order, that whyle the Lord in this hys holy Sacramēt offreth vs so large a couenaūt of mercy, we shal thincke scorne, to kepe the condicions therof, and the rules that he hath prescribed vnto vs? No man doubtles (no not in Ciuile matters) would be so serued: wher like as it is no bargaine, til both parties be agreed, so cōmeth it to no perfect effecte, neither can it stand vnlesse the duties, cōdicions & promises be kept. Neuertheles this thing shal appeare muche more euident, if we compare the practise of these present miserable dayes▪ to the order of the

                  ord and his Apostles in the primitiue church, & lay the one agaynst the other. As for the perfourmaūce of the condicions on hys party, ther is no doubt: For wher as he couenanteth with vs in thys holy Sacrament, so to feede, nourish, & cō

               But how now? How kepe we our touche with him? By his order there should be no

And what a doo is ther, about the maner of Christes presence in the Sacrament? Lord what tossing & turnyng, what detorting and wrestinge of the Scriptures is there, to proue

the carnal & natural presence of Christes flesh and bloude (yea that in the fourme of bread, ther is contained the only natural substāce of Christ, God and man, flesh bloud & bone) to the vtter confounding of the two natures in Christ, though both the circūstāce of Christes action, the propertyes of hys humaniti, the nature of a Sacramēt, the Articles of ye Christian faith, the euident testimonies, aswell of the scripture, as of those that are estemed the best and moost worthye auncient wryters, declare the contrary?
               Men should refourme al abuses about thys mater, and come to it in a better sorte then they haue done: And do they not wilfully kepe & maintai

The Lord biddeth his disciples take the breade: but oure lay people (whō we trust yet to be the Lords disciples) are forbiddē to touch it. The Lord saith: Take ye, & eate ye,

he saith not, take thou it alon, and let no mā els eate with the. He saith, take and eate: he saith not, lift it vp aboue your heades: But nowe the Priestes take and lyft it vp an high. He sayeth: Take and eate, and saieth not hang it vp: But now it is taken & hanged vp by a lyne or cord. He sayth: Take and eate, and saith not, take and worshyp it as God: But now men crouch and kneele vnto it, honour and worship it as theyr maker. The Lord saith. Take & eate: He saith not, put it vp in store. or kepe it in a boxe tyl another tyme: But now it is reserued & caried about in procession, and in the streetes, that the people may fal downe (yea, when they se it not) knocke theyr breastes & worship it. The Lord saith: Do this in remembraunce of me: He sayeth not, do it in remembraunce of others: but now the Priestes do theyr Masse in remembraunce of the quicke & deade, in remembraunce of Angels & saints: they make an oblacion & sacrifice of it for the soules departed, for beasts and Catfel, for syknesses and diseases. &c.

The Lord willeth al the Disciples that were with him, to drinke of the Cup, and the Euangelist saith▪ that they al dranke of it: But now the part of the Sacrament is takē from the lay people, as though Christ had not shed his bloud for thē, as wel as for others.
               What can we then iustly looke for at the Lordes hand to be partakers of in this worthy Sacrament, when we so vnworthely disdaine & think scorne to minister, receaue and vse it according to the Lordes most holy institucion: but chop and chaunge, adde and minysh, after the pleasures, imaginacions and fond fantasies of men, & not after the word of the Lorde, nor after the rightful practise of hys primitiue and most pure Church?
               Because the Corinthians did so vnworthely behaue them selues aboute thys holy Sacrament, by reason of these and such like abuses as we haue now spoken of, and for that thei made no difference of the Lordes body, that is to say, because thei so litle regarded not only his mistical body the church

and congregacion, but also the death and merites of his natural blessed body that suffred and was crucified for them: therfore (saith the Apostle) many are weake and sicke among you, and many sleepe. And what thing els vnder the Sunne, hathe more prouoked the wrath and indignatiō of god ouer vs, or is a greater occasion why he withdraweth his grace & holy spirit from vs, and otherwise also sēdeth his sondrye plages amongst vs: Yea, what hath bene or is at thys daye, a greater cause of his displeasure, thē is the most filthy and abhominable idolatry and supersticion of theyr masse, the blinde and wylfull abusing of the Sacramēt, when neither the doctrine of the Lord is trulye taught nor beleued, neither those worthye fruites of repentaunce folow, that so godly florished in the primitiue churche, & that so vertuously shuld appeare in euerie one that receaueth ye holy cōmunion?
               But now to conclude, for our own part: This worthy Sacrament of our Lord and only sauiour Iesus Christ,

we so honour and reuerence, that we are fully resolued and perswade
                     •
                   (by the testimony of hys holy word) that it is a synguler and precious Iewell▪ which the Lorde himselfe, by hys last wyl and testament, hath moste graciously cōmitted and left to hys owne holy congregacion and church, to the intent that the same worthye Sacrament, which he ordayned to be a special renewing of hys gracious couenaunt with vs, and an vndoubted testimony and seale of his louing mercy towardes vs, should be also a continual and frutful exercise of our faith loue & hope to himward, & a myghtye prouocaciō vnto charity and al good workes among our selues. So as we fyrst duely examining our owne consciences, and then assembling our selues orderly to that solempne memorial of our redemption, hearing there the death of the Lorde, declared vnto vs: callyng the same in special (and all other hys benefites in general) moste thankfully to remembraunce: lamenting, bewailing, and repēting vs earnestly

of our sinnes: knowledgyng & cōfessing them vnto God, 
                     •
                  euoutlye calling vpō him for mercy, professing a new vertuous life: conuertynge vs wholy vnto him, & forgeueing one another in brotherly reconsiliacion frō the botome of our hartes, shoulde in the vnity of the holy Ghost, aproche reuerently vnto the table of the Lord, and worthely receiue such notable increase of heauenly cōfort, & spirituall repaste in our consciēces, as He there for that purpose (by the cōmuniō and felowship that we haue with hym in his precious body & bloude) most louinglye doth offer vnto vs, euen clothing vs, as it were wyth a newe power and strengthe frō aboue: that we being armed a freshe with hys owne weapons, may frō hence
                     •
                  orthe fyght themore valeauntly vnder his baner, against the flesh, y• world, & the Diuel: whiche to do, he graunt vs hys grace and holy spirit. Amen.
