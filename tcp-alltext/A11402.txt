            To his Translation.
            
               GO little eccho of anothers voice,
               Tell in thy mother tongue a strangers mind.
               And when thou com'st abroade, and findest choise
               Of readers differing in their various kind,
               Reeccho backe vnto the gentle spirit,
               Such thankes as his iudicious skill shall merit.
            
            
               But if thou meete with any dunsing lauell,
               That is an homager to ignorance,
               And yet doth enuiously presume to cauill,
               And blunder out such words as these by chance:
               That he sees not how Bartas doth surpasse,
               Diuide his word, and turne him backe the Asse.
            
         
         
            
            TO THE HONORABLE handes of the most noble and valorous Knight, Sir Walter Raleigh, Lord VVarden of the Stanneries, Captaine of her Maiesties Guard, Lieutenant of the countie of Cornewall, and Gouernour of the Ile of Iersey.
            
               BEing desirous (my honorable Lord) to exhibite some testimony of that ardent desire which I haue to doe your Lordship seruice, I am enforced to imitate that poore mā, which wanting better meanes to expresse his aff

                  rxes. For, knowing your Lordships loue to learning, (for Ars non habet inimicum nisi ignorantem) and hauing no inuention of mine owne, I haue boldly aduentured to draw water from another mans fountaine, and to commend this poore translation to your fauourable censure and honorable protection. Which I do the more humbly desire, for that I know your Lordships honorable name will be a sufficient bulwarke against those snarling dogs, Quibus innatum est, vt non pro feritate, sed pro consuetudine latrent, which barke

more of custome then of curstnesse; which being guiltie to themselues of their owne imperfections, and hauing such muddie wits, that a man would sweare they were borne at Puddle wharfe, do notwithstanding labour to build their owne reputation vpon other mens disgraces; and by disgorging their malicious censures vppon the painful indeuors of all those which either diligētly write, or painfully translate, do thinke to purchase a lease of eternall commendation. I will not blot my paper with any commendation of my Author, who was so noble for his birth, so famous for his learning, and so admirable for his inuention; lest I should seeme to hang out a bush where good wine is alreadie knowne to be sold, or to light a candle when the Sunne is in his vertical point. For if he proue any where distastful to your iudicious vnderstanding, I must ascribe the fault to my selfe, which haue done him iniury, to cloath him with a sute so ill fitting to his proportion. But how meane soeuer it be, my humble request is, that your Lordship will accept it as a pledge of his dutifull loue, which is desirous to be euer at your Lordships commandement. And so humbly presuming to kisse your faire hands, I pray continually for the happie successe of all your honorable deseignements.
            
               Your Honors most humbly deuoted, TH. VVINTER.

               HEauen, Labour, Art, all ioyntly did conspire
               To crowne thy verse with neuer-fading bayes:
               First Gods sweete breath did teach thy Muse t'aspire
               To caroll out Lord Bartas heauenly layes.
            
            
               Then thy high thoughts to second this rare choise,
               Droue forth with matchlesse paines thy great intent:
               And last to sing Gods notes with Angels voice,
               Art did consort to make a full concent.
            
            
               Great choise, great paines, great art, all good, all great▪
               
               All three thy litle booke do greatly praise:
               Why striue I then in Honours chaire to seate
               Thy Muse, which of it selfe, it selfe can raise?
            
            
               O then braue impe of Phoebus still pursue

               Let enuious France by reading find this true,

                  WInter, a man would thinke thy works are cold,
               That did but heare thy name, or know thy kind,
               But yet such heate this worke of thine doth hold,
               As in a Sommers day we scarce shall find
               Among our hote-brain'd Poets. Thou hast hit
               Vpon that heate (though with another fire)
               That did enflame the rarest Poets wit,
               That ere in France (worlds garden) did respire.
               
                  Bartas, the bosome of whose blessed Muse
               
               With Homers sacred fire (refin'd) did burne:
               Did (as should seeme) into thy breast infuse
               That fire by touching him; for thou dost turne
               His heate to thine, and thine to his, if so
               Both in this Tract translated thou dost show.
            
            
               His opinion Touching translators, and translation.
               TO turne one tongue t'another is a tricke
               That many tongues-men can in prose performe;
               But when the tongues on numbred feete do sticke,
               It's hard two tongues discordant to conforme.
               Who word for word, and phrase for phrase translates
               In verse, may vaunt he earnes his Authors fame:
               But, but few tongues are tyde t'our English pates,
               That can with ease directly do the same.
               Many translators haue we, but not many
               That turne not th' Authors meaning with his words.
               Famous were England if she had not any,
               That to them selues such libertie affords.
               To translate so, is to adulterate:
               And all Adulterers God and men do hate.

               erse errors touching the generation, corruption and alteration of things in their matter and forme. After, breathing a while, he enters a discourse of the Aire, shewing how it is deuided, what the temperature of each region is, with the causes of the same: and how

the mists, the blasts, the clouds, the deaw, the yee and other waterie meteors are ingendred: and consequently intreateth of the falling starres, and comets, with the rest of the fiery impressions which are often seene in the two extreme regions of the aire. Hereunto he adioyneth a philosophicall narration of the thunder and lightning, touching in briefe their strange yet certaine effects; not omitting, for the more absolute complement of his discourse, to assigne probable reasons of the raine-bow, the circles about the Sunne and Moone, and the many Sunnes and Moones, which affright the ignorant with their appearance. But albeit he shewes himself a Philosopher in producing these naturall reasons, yet he would haue euery man to shew himselfe a Christian, in not wholy resting satisfied with these second causes; but euer so to acknowledge the wisedome of the Almighty, that he rather admire the creator, then adore the creature: adding thereunto the religious vse, which Christians should make of these impressions and prodigious signes. And that he may clip the wings of mans pride, which is wont to soare beyond it selfe in self-conceits, he demonstrates how it is impossible for the most cunning naturalist, to render sound reasons of all accidents. Then leauing the aire, he ouerthrowes their opinion which hold but three elements, and shewes the difference between that elementarie and our compounded fire; adioyning therunto a briefe treatise of the matter, the motion and number of the celestial spheares. And answering those which are of opinion, that there are no waters aboue the firmament, he assumes a fit occasion to mention the generall floud; with an elegant description whereof he ends this second dayes worke. All which excellent points he adornes with such pleasant illustrations, that

               Thou Learnings spring, soule of this worldly round,

            Of thy great praise, graunt that my keaking quill,

            That in some rate it may be correspondent,
            To the greatnesse of so graue an argument.
            Rid cleane the path, which now I am to tread,
            From bushie brakes which do it ouer-spread.

               That endlesse end▪ broade length and heigth profound,
            Which yet no world, yet was a worldly round:
            That massie lumpe which nourisht ciuill hatred,

            And by our inward heate yeelds moisture, good
            To be conuerted into purest bloud.
            
               This in a burning brand we see full plaine,

            Each of these mingled, though some ones minority,
            Among his brethren beares not like authority.
            So in the bloud, those muddie lees which craue

            Are melancholy; in the middle swimmes

            In a free citie, which doth lose his fashion,
            Soone as the rulers suffer alteration.
            For the light vulgar tost with euerie wind,
            Are to their princes humors still enclind
            Cameleon-like, which change of colours weareth,

            So th' element of which wine most partaketh,
            Now moist, now dry, now hote, now cold it maketh.
            And as these foure are coupled more or lesse,
            So do th' effects and tast the same expresse:
            So that in time the iuyce of grapes vnripe,

            And that same new growes good as it growes old▪
            
            Which kept too long, for vineger is sold.

               Now whiles the Prince which keepes the rest in aw,
            Doth subiugate his greatnesse to the law;
            He rules in safetie and doth still increase,
            His commons ioy for their so happie peace.
            But if of subiects bloud which he doth spill
            By dint of sword, he neuer take his fill,
            At length his rage dispeopling so his land,

            Right so as long as some one element,
            Doth rule the rest with modest gouernment;

               But if that cruell king it represent,
            Who wisht that all of his great regiment,
            Had one sole necke, that at one chop he might
            Butcher all Rome in furious despight:
            Then doth it breed corruption of the rest,
            And th' house whereof the tyrant is possest,

               The chiefest cause of these euanishments,
            Is deadly fewd of our foure elements;
            Which in their turne do prey one on the other,
            As snow and water being maide and mother,
            Do make a mutuall change: each of these foure,
            In two chiefe qualities doth shew his powre;
            Whereof the one doth still the scepter sway,
            To whom the other doth his homage pay.
            Those elements whose forces disagree,
            And wholy sauour of antipathie,

            The fire to water turnes not speedily,
            Nor doth the aire rauen so greedily
            Vpon the earth: for being deadly foes,
            They fight both with their fingers and their toes.
            But aire to water, earth to fire likewise
            Doth sooner turne; for that they symbolize
            Some qualitie: and easier tis to quell
            One enemie▪ then two that do rebell.

               Shall I conceale those various shapes, which be
            Painted in heauens face? Sometimes I see
            A firie circle fram'd of many a ray,
            Which Sunne and Moone, and other starres display;
            Which on some cloude whiles they are darted downe,
            Of substance thicke, and by his figure round,
            Through which they cannot passe with all their strength,
            Flie round about the edges at the length,
            And do a crowne resemble very right.
            Like as the torch, which when it burneth bright
            Within some angle of a darkesome cell,
            Whose gate is bolted, cannot very well
            Send through the doore the lustre of his raies,
            But by the chinkes his flaming light displaies.

               But when the Sun begins himselfe to shrowd
            In Thetis bed, and on some aduerse clowd,
            Vnable any longer to containe
            His watrie humour, shootes his beames amaine;
            Then doth he shadow his resplendent face
            Vpon that cloude▪ and variously doth trace
            The bending of that partie-coloured bow,
            Whose sight doth glad our faces here below.
            For th' aduerse cloude, which doth the arrowes take
            Of this great archer, instantly doth make
            That on the neighbour cloude they backe rebound,
            And doth with Titans golden beames compound
            His various colours: altogether like
            The Sun, which while his darts some violl strike
            Vpon thy window▪ thou dost straight espie
            The trembling brightnesse banded vpwardly,

            The cocke that stands vpon some steepled towre,
            Which doth as oft new place and maister find,
            As in the aire we feele a change of wind.
            Sometimes I am of Aristotles traine,
            Sometimes I follow Plato's mind againe;
            Tracking the foot-steps of the Stagirite,
            
            I rob the firmament of mixture quite.
            I do auerre that Gods omnipotence
            Did fashion heauen of a quintessence:
            Sith that the elements directly flie,
            Some to the center, others to the skie.
            But heauens course giuing no inch of ground,
            Is euer turned in a circled round.
            Their motion dures not, but they so abide,
            As God the worlds first day did them diuide:
            But neuer-breathing heauen still doth runne,

            And knowes not what it is a teeme to baite.
            The earth and water, fire and aire vnited,
            Are with an inbred warring hate delighted,

            Their aire is free from tossing, and their fire

            From his high mansion to tumble downe,

            Was shamelesse, lawlesse and withouten grace;
            Who tooke her onely and her chiefe delight,
            To offer to her maker mickle spite.
            The land is hid, now Neptune hath no shore,
            The riuers bend their course to him no more,
            They are a sea themselues, and all the number
            Of seas, which earst deuided were asunder,
            Make but one ocean; yea this vniuerse
            Is nothing but a watrie wildernesse,
            Which longs to ioyne his liquid wauing plaine,
            Vnto the flouds which in the heauens remaine.
            The sturgeon coasting by the castled bowres,
            Admires the drowning of so many towres.
            The mular and the manat side those rockes,
            Where lately fed the wantonizing flockes
            
               Of bearded goates: the Dolphin cuts the

            The horse, the tyger, hart, the hound, the hare,
            By their swift paces now vnsuccour'd are:
            They seeke for ground (alas) but tis no booting,
            For still they see they lose their hoped footing.
            The beauer, torteise and the crocodile,
            Which did enioy a two-fold house ere while,
            Haue nought but water now wherein to dwell:
            The tender lambkins and the Lyons fell,
            The rauenous wolfe, the nimble fallow deare,
            Swimme side by side without suspitious feare;
            The swallow, yearly Herauld of the spring,
            The vulture hatch'd for hatefull rauening▪
            
            fighting, and striuing longer to contend,
            Against their certaine neare approaching end,
            Not finding where to pearch themselues againe,
            Do fall at length into the angred maine.
            As for poore men in that tempestuous stowre,
            Imagine one to get some loftie tower,
            Another to ascend some mountaine hill,
            Another practising his climbing skill,
            With hands and fe

               te clasping some cedar tree,
            Striuing vpon his vpmost top to be;
            But still the floud rising as they ascend,
            If once they stay, their sinfull life doth end.
            One hardily vpon some planke doth venter,
            Another doth into some coffer enter,
            Another swimmeth in some kneading tub,
            Another halfe asleepe perceiues the floud
            T'assaile his bed and life at once; another
            Keepes with his armes and legs a swimming pother.

            Whose rage but euen then deuoured hath

            His friend, his child, his father and his mother:

               ld againe,
            
               Vnto the mercie of the cruell maine.
            All stand at once at death his loathed doore,
            But yet the cruell Parcae, which of yore
            Were arm'd with many a murthering deuice,
            To rake to them the things of greatest price,
            No other hangmen at this instant haue,
            Beside the froathie ouer-whelming waue.
            Meane while the Arke securely doth remaine,
            Vpon the surges of that watrie plaine;
            Tho all vnrigd from any hauen farre,
            For God was both her pilote and her starre.
            Thrise fiftie dayes this monstrous floud did stay,
            Making of all this lower All a pray,
            Vntill this spoile had mou'd at length the Lord,
            Who had no sooner sounded with his word
            Vnto those wasting flouds a backe retire,
            But instantly the billowes do conspire,
            To runne vnto their former place and state;
            And straight the swelling riuers do abate:
            The sea bounds in it selfe▪ the hils appeare,
            The forrest trees which drowned were whileare,
            Do shew their slimie boughes; the champion field
            Encreaseth as the waters backward yeeld.
            And to be briefe, Gods thunder-shooting hand
            Did let the Sunne behold againe the land;
            That he againe might see the smoake arise,
            Of a deuout, sweet-smelling sacrifice,
            Fuming with sweete Panchayan franke-incense,
            Vnto the praise of his omnipotence.
            
               
                  He concludeth vvith a prayer for the Church.
               O God, sith thou art pleas'd in this our age,
            To saue thy holy ship from stormie rage;
            Graunt that those few, whose setled confidence
            Is anchored on thy sacred prouidence,
            May by thy blessing euermore increase
            In number, faith and loue, the bond of peace.
            FINIS.
