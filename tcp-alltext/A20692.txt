               EXcellent Ladie: I send vnto your La: from the Court of a forreine Prince, this volume of my second labours: as to the worthiest Patronesse, of Musicke: which is the Noblest of all Sciences: for the whole frame of Nature, is nothing but Harmonie, as wel in soules, as bodies: And because I am now remoued from your sight, I will speake boldly, that your La: shall be vnthankfull to Nature hir selfe, if you doe not loue, & defend that Art, by which, she hath giuen you so well tuned a minde.
            Your Ladiship hath in your selfe, an excellent agreement of many vertues, of which: though I admire all, Yet I am bound by my profession, to giue especiall honor, to your knowledge of Musicke: which in the iudgement of ancient times, was so proper an excelencie to Woemen, that the Muses tooke their name from it, and yet so rare, that the world durst imagin but nine of them.
            I most humby beseech your La: to receiue this worke, into your fauour: and the rather, because it commeth far to begit, of you. From Helsingnoure in Denmarke the first of Iune.

               GEntlemen, if the consideration of mine owne estate, or the true worth of mony, had preuailed with me, aboue the desire of pleasuring you, and shewing my loue to my friend, this second labours of Maister Dowland, (whose very name is a large preface of commendacions to the booke,) had for euer laine hid in darknesse, or at the least frozen in a colde and forreine country. I assure you that both my charge and paines in publishing it, hath exceeded ordinary, yet thus much I haue to assure mee of requitall, that neither the work is ordinary nor are your iudgements ordinary to whom I present it, so that I haue no reason but to hope sor good increase in my labours, especially of your good fauours toward mee, which of all things I most esteeme. Which if I finde in this, I meane shortly (God willing) to set at liberty for your seruice, a prisoner taken at Cales, who if hee discouers not something (in matter of Musicke) worthy your knowledge, let the reputation of my iudgement in Musicke aunswere it. In the meane time, I commend my absent friend to your remembrance, and my selfe to your fauorable conceits.
