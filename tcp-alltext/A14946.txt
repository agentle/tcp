               The fyrst Chapter.
               
                  That all trouble and affliccion cometh from God.
               
               
                  I Call all that, trouble and affliccyon, whatsoeuer is reputed to be cōtrary to ye desyre and appetite of mans nature, as the vnquyete suggestiōs of the flesh, the temptacions of the deuyll, syckenes of body, a wycked and frowarde mate in matrimony, to haue disobedient children, vnkynd and vnthanful frendes, losse of goodes, to be depryuyd of any old liberty

or priuiledge losse or blemish of name and fame, the malyce & displeasure of mē, hō
                  ger, dearth, pestylens, warre, imprisonement and death. And in this regyster do I put al kyndes of crosses and afflicciōs, whether they be bodyly or ghostlye, oure own or our frendes, priuate & singular or vniuersal & general, pryuy & secret or opē & manifest, deserued or vndeserued. In al such thinges, I saye, euery Christen man ought first of al to cōsider the very roote, groūd, & beginning, after this wise. That al thinges whatsoeuer God sendeth, we ought to take & receiue thē paciently. For this is ones true that god is our creator & maker, & we his workemā shyp, he is our kyng, our Lord & father. And lyke as it is not semyng that the put should murmur Rom. ix agaynst the po
                     •…
                  maker, euen so is it much lesse cōuenient that we should murmur & grudge against Gods wil and iudgemēt Ro. ix. And although trouble & affliccion ryseth and spryngeth often tymes by the wyckednes of enemies and thorowe the instigacyon of the deuell or els by some other meane, yet ought we neuer to ymagyne that it cometh by fortune or chaūce wythout the permyssyon, sufferance, demynacyon

and wyll of God, but by and wyth the fore knowledge, prouydence, and appoyntement of god. And to speake properly, concernynge safegard, it is all one (su that we tempte not God) whether we lyue in pouertye, or in ryches, in the fyre or in the water, among our enemies, or among our frendes, seynge that God seyth, knowyth, dysposyth, and rulyth all thynges. As wytnessyth the fyrste booke i. re. ij. b. deu. xxxij Sa. xvi. c Tob. xiij and seconde chapter of the kynges. The Lord bryngeth death, and restoreth again vnto lyfe, bryngeth into the graue and rai seth vp agayn, puttyth downe and exalteth also. And Iob also testyfyeth in hys myserye, the Lorde dyd geuen it, and the Iob. iij Lord hath taken it agayne. And Christ in the tenth of Mathewe, There falleth not a sparrow vpon the earth wythoute your fathers wyll, yea the heares of your head are all u
                     •…
                  mbied.
               Seyng then that al our troubles & afflic cions come from God, we ought to hum ble & submit our hartes and mindes vnto the obedience of god, and to suffer him to worck wt vs according vnto his most holy wil and pleasure. Wherfore whensoeuer vnseasonable whether shall hurte and

peryshe the corne and fruite of the earth, or when a wycked man shall mysreporte vs or rayse vp anye slaunder of vs, why should we murmur & grudge against the elemētes or go about to reuenge vs of our enemies? For if we lift not vp oure mindes & consyder, that God laieth his hand vpon vs, & that it is he that stryketh vs, we are euen lyke vnto dogges and no bet ter, which if a man do cast a stone at thē, wyll byte the stone wythout any respecte who dyd cast the stone. And again no mā 
                  mat. xxv ought to be vnwilling or discōtent to render againe that talent or pledge, yt was cōmitted to him onely, to reserue & kepe. It is that God, that geueth vs lyfe, helth of body, strength, wyfe, children, frendes riches, honor, power, auctorite, peace, rest & quietnes, for a time, so longe as pleaseth him. Now if the same God wil take again some of these things, or al, he taketh nothing, but his owne, & euen that which we did owe vnto him. For yt which cause to murmur against his wil, & to stryue against his iudgemēt, it can not be but an heynous and a greuous synne.
            
            
               The second chapter.
               
                  ¶ That trouble and affliccyon and aduersyte

are sent vnto vs of God, euen for the punishment of our synnes.
               
               NOw what thing moueth or causeth god, to send home vnto vs & visite vs wt afflicciō, trouble & ve xacion? concerning this point marke this wel. Whatsoeuer anye mā hath merited & deserued that ought he to beare & to suffer willingly & gladly. Let euery man ap pose & examine him selfe whether he hath not deserued to be correcte & chastened of god, (if it be not for any special thing at yt present instāt,) yet for other sins cōmitted at other times. Now wil our lord god in al maner of punishmētes & visitaciōs, declare yt order of his rightuousnes & his he up wrath & indignaciō against sinne & wic kednes: for he saith in yt. ij. cōmaundemēt: I yt lord which am thy god, am a gelous & an ernest god, & I wil visyte the sinnes of the fathers vpon the children, euen vntill the third & fourth generacion, if they hate Exo. xx & contemne me. And in the. xxviij. chap. of the. v. boke of Moises, are all ye plages rehersed one after another, whych shal be poured out vpō the wicked & vngodly, & in the. xiij. of Luke it is said thus. If ye do not amend ye shal al perish: & yt we may

perceiue euē before our eyes euidētly how that punishmēt & plages are the dewe re warde vnto synne, God temperyth & framyth the punishment, euē like vnto ye syn God punysheth syn with like syn.

               And agayne in the very tyme & myddest of affliccyon and trybulacyon, God geueth vs grace to consyder other good & prosperous thynges whiche we haue and enioy styll, that thorowe the rememberās & consyderacyon of them, oure smarte & payne maye be eased, mollyfyed & mytygated.

Euen so were it possyble ynough for▪ vs to do lykewyse, when so euer anye misfortune shuld happen vnto vs, to waxe angrye & displeased, and to haue no maner of luste nor desyre to vse nor to enioye it vnto that good that styll remayneth & is lefte behynde. Be it in case that thou werte depryued of all maner of bodely comforte, but yet in thy brest & hart thou haste the knoweledge of Iesus Christ which hath redemed the oute of hell and damnacyon that was dewe vnto the, in respecte of the whiche damnacyon all plages vpon earth are to be estemed as one lytle drop of water, agaynst the whole sea. Besydes thys also thorow fayth, thou felest a confydens and assurans of euerlastynge & eternall ioye, As S. Paul doth wryte of the same in the. viij. to the Roma. saying. I suppose that the affliccyons of thys

worlde are not worthy of the glorye that shall be reueled vnto vs. An exāple haue Luc. xv. we set before our eyes in the prodigall & desperate sonne, whiche dyd so humble and submyt hym selfe, that he desyred no more to be taken for a sonne, but to be put to labor as a daye laborer, and an hyered seruaunt, so that he myght but onelye remayne Ihō. viij in hys fathers house, Euen so whatsoeuer God sendeth, ought we to ta ke pacyentlye, so that we maye but onely dwell in the house of God, in heauē with God euerlastingly.

no specyall sorowe nor singular griefe, that appereth vnto the, and thou knowest not what God meaneth thereby, yet oughtest thou (as a chylde vnto the father to geue vnto hym) honor, laude, and prayse, that he dysposeth all thynges wyth such wysdome and in suche order. And when he seyth tyme, he wyll rewarde & consyder all such thynges as haue bene wroughte & committed heretofore agaynst hys most ryght & iust lawes, accordynge as they haue deserued.

               IT is not suffycient for vs to know that all maner of affliccyon commeth by the permyssyon and sufferaunce of God, of hys iuste iudgemente by reason of our synnes. For in extreme temptacyons and in greate necessyties, these are the fyrste thoughtes and ymagy nacyons that come into oure myndes.

(For as muche as I haue greuouslye offended God wyth my synnes, therfore is he displeased wyth me, and nowe become myne enemye, and hath caste hys fauor from me). And yf we preuent not, & shyft awaye such fantasyes & ymaginacyōs in tyme, they wyll make vs to flee frō God, to forsake hym, and to abhorre & grudge agaynst hym, As Saul dyd, which ymagyned & fully persuaded with hym self yt God punyshed hym of hatered & displeasure agaynst hym. And therfore Sauls hart turned from God, and forsoke him, and so he began to hate and abhorre hym as a cruell tyranne. Wherfore vnto suche poyntes and articles as are taught heretofore, thys admonicyon doth also apper teyne. We ought to receyue wyth hyghe thankefulnes, what soeuer God of a fatherly & louynge mynde & not of any indygnacyon towarde vs, sendeth vnto vs, whether it be to the fleshe pleasant or greuous.

are no tokens of the wrath and dyspleasure of God, but rather holye tokens of hys grace mercy and fauor, whereby god assueryth vs of hys mercyfull will and fatherlye harte towarde vs. Item in the. viij. to the Romaynes.

Oure synnes and mysdedes deserue honger, dearth, warre, pestilence, and al maner of plages. Now hath Christ rāsomed and made full satisfaccyon for all the synnes that we haue committed. He hath redemed, payde, discharged, and made harmeles vnto vs al our mysdedes wyth hys bytter deathe & victoryous resurreccyō, & hath satisfyed

So that nowe yf affliccyons hurt vs only by reason of our synnes and oure synnes satysfyed & dyscharged thorowe the death and passyon of Iesus, then must it nedes folowe that all oure affliccyons al so, are lykewyse harmeles vnto vs, and can not hurte vs.

Now, if so be, that we wyll not folow hym, than he beateth and gierketh vs a lytle wyth a rodde, as some tyme wyth pouerty, some tyme wyth sycknes and dyseasys or with other afflyccyons, whych shoulde be namyd & estemyd as nothyng els, but chylderns roddys or the wandys of correccyon.
               Now if suche a rodd or wand wyl not helpe, nor do anye good, than takyth the father a whyp or a styck. As in case, hys sonne waxeth stubburn, & wyl spend hys mony, and thryfft wantonly and ryotosly at the typplyng hows wyth euyll companye,

than comyth the father, pullyth hym oute by the heare of the heade, byndyth hys handes and fete, and beateth hym tyll hys bones crack, and sendyth hym into pryson, or banysheth hym oute of the countrye.
               Euen so whan we waxe obstynate and stubburne, and care in maner neyther for wordes nor for strypys, than sendeth God vnto vs more heuy and vnyuersall plages, as pestylens, dearth, sedycyon, vproure, casualtye of fyre, murther, warre, losse of vyctory, that beynge taken of oure ennemyes we are sed awaye prysoners and captyues &c. And all thys he doeth, to feare and to tame vs, as it were wyth vyolence, and so to dryue and euen to force vs vnto repentance & amendement of our lyues.
               Nowe, trueth it is, that it is agaynste the fathers wyll to stryke hys chylde, he woulde muche rather do hym all the good that euer he coulde. But thorowe longe sufferance, and ouer muche cheryshyng the chyldren waxe rude and forget all nurture.
               ¶ Therefore doeth he punish them, but yet in the myddes of all hys anger

and punishment, hys fatherly hart brea

                  eth out.
               In case that he putteth his sonne away from him, for some greuous faulte, yet he sendeth hym not awaye alltogether comfortles, but geueth hym some garmentes and some comfortable wordes, and so sen deth hym from hym, not to remayne for euermore in banyshment, but when he is ones a lytle humbled, mekenyd, & amendyd, to returne home agayn. And thys is only the fathers mynd to turne and kepe from hys sonne all suche thynges as myght hurt and destroy hym, and neuer min deth to cast away or vtterly to forsake his chyld. Euen so certainely, when God sen deth mysery and affliccyon vpon our neckes, there lyth hidden vnder that rodde, a fatherly hart and affeccion. For the peculyar and naturall property of God is to be louynge and frendelye, to heale, to helpe, and to do good to mankynd.
               Adam and Eue when they were put into paradyse, were they not plentuously endued wyth all good thynges? But they could not order nor vse them ryghtly, as 
                     •…
                  oue of as all can, but assone as we haue all thynges, at pleasure and lack nothing

that we coulde despre, then furth wyth waxe we faynt, neglygent and slouthful.
               And therefore God sendeth vs euyll, that he maye do vs good, and yet in the myddes of all affliccyon and punishment he sendeth some mytygacyon comforte and succor.
               As we maye take example by our forsayd fyrst parentes Adam and Eue, when as God was fullye determyned vpon yt very poynt, to exclude and banishe them out of paradyse: Fyrste he clothed them agaynst the frost and vyolence of the wether. And he comforted them also wyth the promes of the blessed sede, whych maketh al maner of affliccion, not only easy & harmles, but also holsome & profitable vnto vs. And this same nature doeth the immutable god neuer change but kepeth it cōtynually, he wyll not vtterly forsake vs, but only suffer vs a lytle to smart for the synnes, that we haue committed, and so preserue vs from synne afterwarde, that we runne not into the daunger of eternall payne.
               Furthermore, be it in case, that the father hath two sonnes, wherof the one behauyth hym selfe wyckedly, and yet hys

father punisheth or correcteth hym nothing at al, the other for the leaste fawt is taken vp, & correct by & by. What thing els, is the cause of this, but that the father hath no hope of amendement at all of the one, & therfore myndyth to put him clerely frō his heritage, & to geue him no part therof. For the heritage perteinyth wholly vnto that sunne, that is chastenyd & cor rectyd. And yet the same poore sonne, that is thus chastenyd, thinckyth in his mind, that his brother is much more happy thē he, for as much as he is neuer beaten nor strykē. And therfore he sythes and mour nyth by him selfe, & thynketh thus: well, my brother doth what he will against my fathers will, & without his leaue, and yet my father gyuyth hym not one fowle word, he suffreth him to take his pleasure & to ronne where he will: and towardes me he shewyth not so muche as a good looke, but is euer in my top, if I do but looke

haue Christen men & wemen also, whan as they suffer much trybulacion, and see on the other syde how prosperously it goyth wyth the wycked and vn godlye sorte.
               Where as they ought rather to comfort them selues wyth the remembrance of the heritage that is reseruyd for them in heauyn, whyche apperteynyth vnto them as good and vertuos chyldern. As for the other that hopp and spryng, make mery and take their pleasure nowe for a whyle, they shall be depryuyd of the heritage euerlastingly, as strangers, and shal haue no part thereof. And thys prouyth Saynct Paul, Heb. xij. where he saieth: My sonne, feare not whan thou art correctyd of the Lorde, but receyue hys punyshment thanckfully, and wyth a good wyll. For whom so euer the Lord louyth, hym doeth he chastyse and punysh, and scourgyth euery chyld, that he receiuyth. Nowe if ye be partakers of correccion, than doth God offer and shewe hym self vnto you as a father. And if al those that be chyldren, be correctyd and ye wythout correccyon, are ye not than bastarde

Wherfore although the allmighty Lorde sheweth hym self displeased wyth vs, it is nothyng els but a displeasure of a most kynd and louynge father, whyche seketh not our destruccyon, and vndoynge, but onely our reformacion, amendement and welth. Geue ouer thy selfe therfore pacyently vnto the wyll of God thy faythfull father. Reioyse in the correccion of the Lord, for as muche as thou art sure and certain thereby, that he beareth a gracyous, and a fatherly hart, mynd, and wil, towardes the.
               Furthermore, God is also in this behalf, cōpared to a mother. The mother fedyth God is takē for a mother and norysheth the chyld, and all the good she can do vnto it, that doeth she,

eue of a tender and motherly harte. And yet thorow the frowardnes and vnrulynes of the chyld is she sometyme so mouyd ☜ and prouokyd that she is angry with it, chydyth it, rebukyth it, and beatyth it. Euen so were it the very nature and propertye of God, to suffer no maner of misfortune to happen vnto vs, but yet thorow our manifold synnes he is prouokyd to punysh and chasten vs. Nowe as lytle as the mother denyeth, forsakyth or gyueth ouer the chyld, though she be angry wyth it & dysplesed it, Euen as lytle doth God forsake or geue ouer vs in our nede and necessyte, myserye and afflyccyon though he seme neuer so muche to be dyspleased wyth vs. Scrypture for thys haue we Esay. xlix. If a mother can forget her chyld, than maye I forget the also sayeth the Lord: but if she shoulde forget her chylde, yet wyll I not forget the.
               
               There is neuer a scholemayster, nor handy craftes man, whyche takyth anye God a scholemaister. scholer or prentes vnto hym to teache, but he wyll make these condycyons with him expressely, that the ladd shall not be selfe wyllyd, nor stubburn, nor folowe

                  , If he beynge hys mayster, should beate and punishe him therefore, that he be content and take it pacientelye and with a good will.
               Nowe, the maister doeth not correcte and punish his scolar or seruant, for anye intent to hurte him or for any malyce and euyll will, towards hym, but onelye that he shoulde learne better afterwarde, be more diligent and take better hede. Euen so lykewyse Christ receyueth no scholer or disciple vnto hym, but he makyth cōdi cions wyth him most necessary for euery Christen man, whyche are expressyd in in the. xvi. chapter of Mathew.

               Dauid sayth in the. cxviij. Psalm. O Lorde howe good and profytable is it vnto me that thou hast chastened & humbled me, that I might learne thy ryghtuousnes and thy commaundementes?

                  Trouble and affliccions do helpe and further vs to the righte knoweledge of our synnes, and to perfyte sorowe and repeutaunce for them.
               
               GOd requyreth that the knoweledge of oure poysoned & corrupt nature and of the wrathe of God shulde waxe & increase in vs, whereby we myght

conceyue an harty sorowe and repentaūce for our synnes, and so daylye amende and waxe better. Now truthe it is that in oure hartes naturally stpketh a roughe securenes and carefulnes, whereby we do lytle regarde and esteme the inwarde fylthynes of oure hartes. And specyallye when we fele no maner of tast of the crosse and affli ction we do not consyder the myserable wretchednes of oure synnes nor the iuste iudgemēt of God, and the terryble ponysh ment dewe for the same. But whan the hand of God doth humble & pluck downe some specyall persons or an whole congregacyon, then remember we the greatnes & heauynes of synne, that Gods wrath and indygnacyon is not so sore, wythoute some specyall and moost iuste causes.
               And then breake we oute into suche wordes as these. O Lorde, we haue deserued these plages a thousande wayes. O good & most iust God, thou rewardest the mysdeedes and transgressyons of the fathers in the chyldren, yf they folowe theyr fathers steppes, euen vnto the thyrde and fourth generacyon.
               Lyke as the harde copper and synne do melte in the fyre, euen so in trouble & affliccyō
                  
the hard rough & stubborne hartes do melt & fall to myslyking & loothyng their synnes. A trespasser doth than first of all perceyue hys fautes ryghtely when he is brought vnto the iudgement to be ponyshed, and is adiudged and condemned vn to death. And for thys cause doth God vse suche rough and harde meanes with vs. And bothe the comon and generall, & also the perticular specyall plages and aduersityes maye well be called a part of Gods lawe, and as it were Gods preachynge whiche testyfye and declare vnto vs, that God is heuyly displeased against all maner of wickednes and abhomynacyon that reygneth in the worlde, that all men shulde humble and submytte them selues vnto God, bewayle and lamente theyr synnes vnto hym wyth a sorowfull and a ryghte penitente harte, and despre hys grace and mercye.
               
                  For an example Genes. xlij. Iosephs brethren in Egypte dyd than fyrste of all spye theyr wickednes cōmitted agaynste their brother, when as very nede & necessi te dyd vexe them in a strange contrey.
               
               Numer. xxi. When as the Lorde dyd sende into the wyldernes among the Isra

               When the pestylence dyd rage, then i. Para, xxij. c. sayde Dauid vnto the Lorde, beholde it is I that haue synned, what haue these shepe done?
               
               Nowe therfore yf it be so, that know ledge of the synne and an harty dyspleasure agaynste it be profytable and necessarye, then can we not well forbeare trouble and aduersyte.

               THat oure fayth is proued & tryed thorowe the crosse and thorow ad uersyte, it is declared before. And nowe shal it be euidently proued, that our fayth is then fyrste ryght stablyshed, exer cysed and augmented when aduersyte cō meth.

Which thynge can not be ryght cōprehended. Wyth vayne thoughtes, ymaginacyons and speculations, but God cometh vpon the myserable synners with heapes of myseryes. Whatsoeuer they attempte, go aboute or take in hande it goeth backwarde with them, and theyr whole lyfe is made bytter wyth gall vnto them that they can no where fynde anye reste. And why? Forsoth it is drye for thys purpose that they shulde vtterlye neglecte and despyse all maner of councell & comforte of man, that they shulde be pluckt from all maner of truste in the polycyes and powers of ye worlde, and that they shulde vtterlye despayre of all helpe in anye creature. And in the steade of that, that they shulde set & fyxe theyr hartes and myndes onelye in God, and that nothyng at all shuld els remayne in them, but onelye vnspeakable syghtning vnto God procedyng out of a true faythe, in whose helpe and mercy only altogether consisteth.

And so after that they felt and prouyd, that there was none that coulde succor and helpe them, but only the Lorde vnto whom they yeldyd and gaue ouer them selues at length.

But by him that lyeth on hys dead bedde, is all styll, not a worde Eccl. vij spoken, but honest & semelye. All thinges are done sadly, demurely and discretelye.

And sodenlye is rauyshed wyth the bewtye of some wyfe or mayden, that he sawe at the daunsyng, which hath wounded & stryken hym to the harte. And when he co meth home, he loketh sowersye on hys wyte, is frowarde towarde his chyldren, and teasty agaynste all the housholde, so that no man can please hym.

                  Trouble and Aduersyte teacheth men to coutemne despise & defye the worlde, and to be dylygent and feruēt in all godlynes and vertue.

we desyre health of body, but God gyuet vs sycknes, And so murteryth & murseth vs in mysery and with affliccyon that we can no more tell what a delycous and ten der plesant lyfe in thys worlde meaneth, and thus begin we to contemne and looth all trāsytory thynges & to desyre an other more better, precyous and an eternal lyfe, where all maner of mysery shall haue an end.
               He that taketh a yourny in hand and goyth into a strange contry, whan he comyth into a pleasaunte towne where he metyth mery company and good compa nyons, parauenture he spendyth awaye the tyme & taryeth to long amonge them and so forgettyth his houshold and thynges at home. But if one hard mischaunce after another happen vnto hym, than he makyth the more haste home agayne to hys wyfe and chyldern, where he hath more rest and quyetnes. Euen so whan these transytorye thynges, as ryches, health, bewty, much prosperte, honor and dygnyte happen vnto vs, if we wyl ones gape vpon them and delyght so muche in them that we do the lesse regard & esteme the heauenly lyfe, than will God make

the waye roughe and crabbyd vnto vs here in thys lyfe, that we should not take and esteme thys transytorye lyfe in thys world for oure ryghte naturall countrye towardes the, whyche we take oure yourneye.
               For example. The chyldern of Israel had lytle luste to synge and to playe vpon anye pleasant instrumentes, whan they sate as prysoners by the ryuers in Babylon. Psal. cxxxvi.
               And this may a man see and proue by those that are in any dangerous sycknes, or in any hard pryson, or in any anguishe and mysery, how fond they are, vpon eatyng, drynckyng, gallant apparell, dansyng, toyeng, playnge and gamynge or vpon any maner of worldly felicyte. I sup pose the crosse and theyr heuynes haue wyped away and lyckyd of, all such thin ges, as cleane as the hoote sunne lyckyth and meltyth away any snowe. Furthermore they that be poore and in dystres and heuynes they are allwayes redyer to forsake this world & are more desyeros to depart hence to god, than those that haue riches, helth & felycyte at pleasure.
               And therefore S. Austyn in hys boke de

symbolo wrytyth thus. Behold how god hath replenyshed and fyllyd the worlde wyth so manye affliccions, and wyth so muche troublesom aduersyte. It is bytter, and yet is it louyd: It is ruynose and redy to fall, and yet it is inhabyted. Oh thou my deare derlynge worlde: what should we doo, if thou weryst swete, stable and permanente, seynge we doo thys nowe? O thou foule and vncleane worlde, if thou arte bytter and yet deceyuyst and begylyste vs, whom woldeste thou not deceyue and begyle if thou werest swete.
               And the crosse doth not onelye dryue and set vs forward to all mauer of vertue Dylygence & feruency and puttyth vs in mynd of al Godlynes, but it quyckenyth and kyndelyth also a diligence and feruencye in vs, to procede and goo forward in all goodnes lustyly, stowtly, earnestly, manfully and not lytherly or sayntly.
               Lyke as a man sometyme must spurre hys horsse, although he be a good and a quycke horsse, that he may goo and ronne the faster and spedyer: Euen so we can not goo forwarde in oure vocacyon & callyug so spedyly, nor so well as we oughte

               And the more that oure sorow and aduersyte augmentyth and increasyth the

greater ayde and assystence shall we fynd and perceyue. i. Cor. x. God wyll not suffer  you to be tēpted aboue your strength, but together wyth youre temptacyon, he wyll make a way out that ye shall be able to beare it. By these wordes doeth Paul teache very comfortably that God wyll not tempt, tast nor assaye vs harder nor sorer than we maye awaye wyth, and be able to beare.
               ii Cor. i. As the affliccyons of Christe are plentyfull and aboundant in vs, euen so is the cōsolacyon thorow Christ also plen tyfull and aboundant.
               
               For example. The holy Apostles were so strēgthnyd that they reioysed that they Acto. iiij v. etc. might suffer any thyng for Christes sake. And at this present day, god sendeth more comfort than all deuyls and al the world are able to send heuines, sorow & discōfort.
               Lyke as a captain in warre, geuyth his God helpeth and comfortyth thorow hys worde & spyryte. sowdgers that are vnder him a great corage by speakyng manfully & comfortably vnto them: Euen so God wyll haue hys comfortable word dayly to be publyshed & proclamed abrode to the intente to incorage his sowdgers that fyghte vnder hys baner. And yet he is not so satisfyed

that we should be incoragyd wyth bare & symple wordes, but he him self is present Matth. xxviij by vs wyth his spirite. which spiryt as a sure warant & an ernest peny, certifyeth & assueryth our hartes, of the grace, fauor & Ro. viij. ayde of god. And thus he comfortyth & reioysyth oure hartes vnfaynedly, & geueth vs wysdom, boldnes and strength to skimmysh and fpght against al maner of enuy myes, as well ghostly as bodyly.

               Lyke as the yonge infant is not able to goo of him self for very tendernes & lack of strength, but must be susteined, holden vp, & led with the hand of the norse, And like as a syck woman wekened

but some whole and strong wemen must take her vnder the arme, guyde and leade her that she may goo wyth them: Euen so are we not able to go of our selues. There is some kynd of sorow and marterdome, that we tremble & quake for feare, whan we doo but heare of it, muche lesse were we able to suffer and to beare it, but God wyth hys myghty hand & presente power strengthnyth, susteynyth & preseruyth vs. Ro. viij. The spyryte succouryth and helpyth our weakenes and infirmityes. And if the deuyll thorowe hys spyryte doeth dryue and moue the people, that they are ready and wyllynge to all wyckednes & abhomynacyon though it cost them their lyues, why should not God thorowe hys spyryte make vs as lusty and wyllyng to all goodnes, whatsoeuer sorowe or affliccyon we suffer.
               Sometyme God mytygatyth and easyth the ponyshmentes, that men may the more easyly ouercome them.
               The captayne gyueth sometyme hys sowdgers lyberty to take their reast, ease and pastyme, that they may somewhat refresh them selues, and afterwarde fyghte the more manly and freshly: Euen so our

spyrytuall captayne grantyth oft tymes vnto hys Christians a certen recreacyon, case and rest whereby they maye refreshe and reuyue them selues, that they maye afterwarde handle them selues the more valiantly in their spirituall affayres. And sometyme he dischargyth vs vtterly of al mauer of trouble and vnquyetnes, and re storyth all oure lossys and hynderances agayn, and deliueryth vs to our singular preemiuence prayse and commendacyon and kepyth and sauyth vs from all maner of mysery and vnquyetnes in tyme to come.

And therfore whansoeuer I suffer any smart, payne or sorow, both christ and all true Christyans suffer wyth me. For in the. xxv. of Mathewe. The Lorde sayth not, they were hongry, and thyrsty, Esa. lviij eze. xviij. &c. But he sayeth I was hongrye and I

was thyrstye, &c. And furthermore the whole congregacyon of Christ doth help me to beare my burden, For they that are the members of one bodye take care and Gal. vi. sorow one for another. If the sole of the fote be hurt, doeth it not greue the whole body?
               Now Saint Paul callyth all Christen men one body. i. Corinth. vi. and also one breade and one cupp. And therfore all other faythfull Christians haue compassyon and are heauy and sorowfull for me, And whatsoeuer is light vnto them is also lyght vnto me.

For whosoeuer knoweth, and is fully persuaded, that he hath a gracyous and a mer cyfull God wyth whome, after thys myserable lyfe, he shall lyue euerlastinglye: The same shall suffer all maner of trouble and aduersyte pacyently, Christenlye Ro. iiij. v. vi. viij Gal. iiij Ephe. ij. and thankefullye.

                  Examples and causes takē oute of naturall thynges, and of Heathen men, whereby a man may be moued to pa cience in adversyte.
               
               IF there were no holye Scripture at all, yet might a man of his owne reason take example of brute beastes, of naturall thynges, as of the body & soule & the naturall partes vnto them belonging, Also of hethen men, Iewes and handycraftes men, & of all maner of states and degrees of men, & lykewyse of the angels, and of the deuyll, whereby they myght conclude & learne, that they ought to be haue them selues pacientlye, boldlye & manfullye in aduersite & mysfortune.
               A lambe or a shepe is ledde vnto the Examples of slaughter, and neuer crye, nor open the

mouth, but suffer and abyde it pacyentlye brute cre atures & natural thinges. Mat. v. and mekely. Euen so ought the holy elect of God, whan they are cursyd and reuyled, not to curse or reuyle agayne, whan they are smytten not to smyte agayn, but to suffer all maner of smart and payne, & not ones to blere or to open their mouthes agaynst it.
               Our body is but very wormes meate: And if we coulde bestowe the same to the honor of our redemer and sauyor Christe ought we not to be glad and to reioyse if we myght so doo?
               Lyke as they that are syck and dyseased can be content to suffer and abide any of their members of theyr body to be cut of, and to be burnte so that they maye be anye thyng releuyd and easyd thereby of their great smart and contynuall payne, (whych is yet but transytorye) & be made whole and sownd agayn: Euen so ought we gladlye and wyllyngly to suffer oure Lord god, and to be styl and quyet, whan he sendeth vs aduersyte, wherby we may be releuyd & discharged of eternall payne and obteyne helth, blesse and saluacyon for our soules.
               If thou canst consyder the order and

course of nature that is naturallye wrytten in thy harte, thou shalt thereby lerne and conclude that a man oughte to be so strong and stedfast that he oughte not to be moued by anye smart, payne or other temptacyon to doo any thyng that is vnsemyng or agaynst honesty.

               Aristotle in hys boke of maners teatheth that felycyte and blessednes consysteth not specyally in helth of bodye, in aboundance of goodes, or in worldlye honor, dignyte and estymacyon, but rather in the exercyse and practyse of vertue:

Oute of the whyche it folowyth that a man that is vertuous maye be blessed though he haue neuer so much trouble or aduersyte. And he reckenyth and takyth troble and aduersyte for the verye mater and occasyon, whereby vertue is moste styrryd vp and exercysed and wherein it doth moste shyne and appeare. And thesame Arystotle also comparyth an honest and vertuous man vnto a good capten. For lyke as a good capten leadyth and orderyth hys host, accordyng as the occa syon requyryth: Euen so a vertuous man behaueth hym selfe pacyentlye and well in aduersyte and maketh the beste of it.
               The Stoykes dyd teach playnelye that it was not to be rekenyd for an euyll thynge to lyue in pouertye, syckenes and myserye, but thys only to be euyll, to forsake vertue, and shewe any poynt of dishonestye.
               Lycero one of the moste notable and excellent Romanes wryteth thus, Remember and persuade thys wyth thy selfe, that besydes synne and dyshonestye, nothynge can happen to a man, where at he oughte to be astoynyd or abashed.

               Among the greciaus Arystides an excel lent vertuous man, beynge banyshed out of hys countrye dyd take and suffer hys mysery very manfully and pacyently.
               Among the Romaynes Camyllus and Attylyus Regulus were hyghly commen ded and praysed for their excellente pacyence and stowtenes, whych they shewed in aduersyte.
               Scypio coulde haue defended and reuenged hym selfe of the sedycyous rebelles wyth force and strong hand. But of

an excellent pryncely hart, he wente onte of the syghte of hys enemyes for a tyme, and suffered much trouble and iniurye of them, for the profyte of hys lande, lesse he shoulde geue them occasyon to more bytternes and fearcenes.

And agayn we shuld to the vttermost of our power flee and abhorre all suche The deuyll. thynges as myghte delyghte and reioyse the deuyll, For he is the deadly arch enmye of God, and of all mankynd. i. Pet. v.
               
               Nowe this is the verye purpose of hys temptacions and suggestions and al that he sekyth, that we, whan we are poore, should steale, and whan we are syck, that we should murmur agaynst god, And in

warre, afflyccyon and aduersyte that we should forsake our Christen fayth and relygyon. Constantnes, faythfulnes & stedfastnes towarde God and the Christen churche, doeth greue and displease hym. Therfore we to reioyce the angels, and to greue the deuyll ought yt rather to be con stant and pacyente in the myddest of all aduersyte.
            
            
               The. xxx. Chapter.
               
                  By what meanys pacyence maye be obteyned, and goten. And ones had, how it may be kept & increased?
               
               NOt wythstanding that we know and perceyue that pacyence is so profytable and fruyteful a thing vnto vs, yet we fele in oure flesh a certen myslykynge, & grudge toward the crosse. Who can be content and glad to see hym self depryuyd, of hys lyfe, honor, estymacyon, goodes, chyldern or wyfe? The rememberance of the pleasure and prosperyte that we haue had in tymes past, doth so greue vs, that wyth Loths wyfe we syghten & loke back after Sodoma. Gen. xix. And wyth the children of Israell, we lust after the fleshpottes in egipt. Ex. xvi.
               And lyke weakenes do we also fynde in

the noble kyng and prophete Dauyd, as he hym selfe sayeth, Psall. lxxvi. Manye saye vnto my soule, he hath no god, My soul would receyue no comfort, my spirit is waxen weake and feble.
               
               Item our sauyour Iesus in hys innocent flesh, dyd shewe and declare the fear fullnes and angwysh of the fleshe, whan as he knelyng vpon the mount Olyuete, consydered hys passyon and marterdom Luc. xxij that was commynge and at hande, and swett for sorowe and angwyshe, so that the droppes of hys swett gusshed vpon the earth lyke droppes of blood, and he prayed vnto hys father, that if it were his wyll, that cupp myght be taken from hym. In lyke maner beynge vpon the crosse he sayd, my god, my god, why hast Ps. xxij a Mathe. xxvii. e. thou forsaken me, howe longe wylt thou thus deale wyth me.
               But it is not to be vnderstande as though Christ dyd dowt of hys fathers fauor and grace, but the weakenes of his fleshe could haue bene contente to haue sufferyd no more. Nowe lyke as the spyryte forepasseth and ouercommyth the fleshe in Christe, Euen so muste it doo in vs also, that we haue more respecte

vnto God and vnto the lyfe euerlastynge than vnto thys wormeeten fleshe. And therefore nowe wyll we declare by most sure and infallyble reasons, by what meanes and wayes a man maye mayster and ouercome hys fleshe in the tyme of the crosse and afflyccyon and so shewe and declare true and perfyte pacyence. Whyche vertue (lyke as all other) hath her fyrste begynnyng and increase of the grace, power and spyryte of God, wythout whom we can worke nothynge that good is, neyther yet resyste or ouercome anye euyll.
               i. Macha. iii. it is wrytten, The vyctory consisteth not in the multitude of men, but the power and strength comyth from heauen.
               
               Item Paul sayeth Philipp. iiij. I am able to doo all thynges thorow hym that maketh me myghtye, whyche is Christe. Wherfore allthough my fleshlye reason synckyth, waueryth and fayleth neuer so muche, yet doth God contynuallye preserue and vpholde my spyryte that it doo not vtterly faynt, but contynewe prompt and wyllynge tyll suche tyme as it maye be delyueryd and eased.

But now, howe shoulde we order and behaue our selues that God maye grant vs his strength, and true pacience and boldnes? Forsoth thorow fayth, hope, prayer, loue, trueth, faythfulnes, vertue and godlynes we may obt

               LAst of all, pacyence serueth to the honor and glory of God, and to the welth and profyte of man, both in soule, bodye, and in transiturye goodes and possessyons, and also in worldlye honor and commendacyon. For the faythfull do resist and wythstande theyr payne and smarte, and pacyently withoute anye gradgynge suffer the lorde to deale wyth them, accordynge to hys owne wyll: Not for any vayne glory nor for any worldlye or transitorye gayne or luker, but onelye & specyallye to she we them selues obedyent to God, and to land and prayse hym.
               As for example, God was as hyghlye

praysed and gloryfyed whan the. iij. companyons of Danyell sufferyd them selues By paci ence god is gloryfyed. so pacyently and manfully to be cast into the hoate burnynge ouen, as he was by the excellent wysdom of daniel, which he declared in that he could open vnto the kyng, his dreame. danye. ij. iij.
               Furthermore, the pacyent is lesse syck, & whan he is syk, he is soner whole agayn: pacyēce is profitable for ye body & goodys. Where as thorow impacyency the hart is pressyd, vexed, guawen, consumed & eaten vp. Prouer. xvij. A merye and a quyete harte is an helpe and furtheraunce to helth, but an heuy and sorowfull mynde maketh the marye and naturall strength to consume. Prouerb. xxv. Lyke as the motthys doo hurt the garmentes, & wormes the wood, euen so doth sorow and he uynes hurte the hart of man.
               
               Whan a chyld beyng corrected and ponyshed of hys father, suffereth it pacyentlye, hys father hath the more pytye vpon hym, and holdyth hys hande, and ceasyth the sooner: But if the chyld shewe hym selfe frowarde, crye anye thynge lowde or murmur and grudge agaynste hym, than is the father the more angrye and fearse ouer hym and

beateth hym the more sharpely. Euen so the heauenlye father ponysheth the pacyent man the more easylye, and healeth hym soone agayn.
               
                  But towarde them that murmur agaynst hym, he shewyth hym selfe sharpe and fearse. Prouerb. xv. A gentle and fryndlye aunswere doeth styll & pacyfye wrath, but rough and stubborn wordes doo prouoke to anger and dyspleasure.
               
               
                  The pacyent man Iob obteyned his Iob. xlij. goodes doble agayne, and was plentyfully recompensed of the Lord, euen here in thys lyfe. The fayethfull haue experyence and profe in verye deede, that it is good for them to be pacyente, and to suffer the Lorde to worcke hys wyll. And agayne manye by reason of theyr impacyencye and murmurynge, doo loose that thynge, that they shoulde els haue had. paci

               Prouerb. xiiij. Sufferance and pacyence is a token of wysdome vnmeasurable heuynes is a token of folyshnes, whā we wepe and complayne lyke chyldern sayinge: I would neuer haue thoughte, I would neuer haue beleuyd that it shoulde haue come thus to passe, and suche lyke.

Item impacyencye intanglyth and insnaryth the mynde, and maketh a man sometyme dull, and at hys wyttes ende.
               Whan a man submittyth and geuyth ouer hym selfe humblye vnto the wyll of God, althoughe hys aduersyte can not be remedyed, yet it shall be easyer and lyghter vnto hym. Yea there is nothynge so bytter, sower, harde or terryble to a man, but by thys meanes, shall be easye, swete, lyghte, and comfortable vnto hym. And agayne so longe as a man doth not vtterlye geue ouer and yelde hym selfe to the good wyll of God, and wyll not suffer hym to worke hys pleasure wyth hym, cō tente whatsoeuer he sendeth, hys grefe is the worsse, and the more harde and bytter vnto hym, hys mynde neuer ceaseth gnawynge and frettynge, and of one sorowe he maketh. iij. or. iiij. yea he maketh hys owne lyfe bytter & sower vnto hym with infyuyte sorowes and vnquyetnes.
               Lyke as the byrde that is caughte

                   wyth the lyme rode, the more it stryueth to delyuer it selfe, the more do the fethers cleaue and hange to the lyme: And in lyke

maner the more the fyshe that is caughte in the net, seketh to come oute, the more it wyndeth it selfe in, And agayne he that is bounde wyth chaynes or fetters of yron, the more he strayeth abroade, the morehar me he doeth to hym selfe: Euen so suche as are frowarde and vnpacyent do increase theyr sorowe, and hurt them selues the more.
               He that hath an heauye burthen vpō hys backe, the more he shuttlyth and moueth the same, ye more doth it greue hym. Euen so the more frowarde and vnpacyent a man is vnder the crosse, the more gre uous and paynefull is it vnto hym.
               It is not vnwysely spoken of the hethen man Plyny whiche saythe. A good harte in aduersyte, taketh awaye the half thereof. And it is a comon prouerbe of the hethen men, The feare of aduersyte and payne, before it cometh, is worsse then the payne it selfe.
               Al maner of ponyshment and aduer syte whiche, accordynge to the meryte & deserte of man, shulde be vnto hym a tast and begynnynge of euerlastynge payne

and dampnacyon: the pacyente man taketh and vseth it for an occasyon to exercyse thereby all kyndes of vertu, wherby the spyrytuall gyftes of grace doo waxe and increase more and more. For they that are paciente doo kepe the true fayth towarde God, crye and call vpon GOD thorowe feruente prayer, honor, laude and prayse God, not onelye for that he rulyth and dysposyth all thynges, but also that he bryngyth all thynges to a good ende and successe, and that he wyll so contynuallye doo. And thus thorowe pacyence, is pacyence increased.
               And contrary wyse the vnpacyente man decayeth daylye in all kyndys of vertuys, and is daylye more and more spoyled and depryued of all goodnes. For whosoeuer is content and can suffer hym selfe to be prouoked of the deuyll and of the fleshe, and geueth place vnto them, the same forsaketh fayeth, prayer and obedyence towarde God, and sufferyth them to depart, and so is vnthanckefull to hys true and fayethfull GOD, whom he can not be contente to suffer, and to commytte hym selfe vnto hym

for a whyle, that he maye the more defende and preserue hym afterwarde. He thynckyth that God doeth not regarde hym, and that it is in vayne to truste and to wayte for helpe, comforte and delyuerance of God. He ymagyneth wyth hym selfe nothynge els, but that God is vtterlye wrath and dyspleased wyth hym. And can fynde in hys harte to curse and to blaspheme God, as thoughe he were a cruell, vnmercyfull and an vnryghtuos God, shewynge more loue and fauor and doyng more good to the wycked than to the godlye.
               And by thys occasyon he sekyth for ayde helpe and comfort at creatures, and maketh vowes vnto sayntes, and to pylgrymagys, that is to saye, to chappels of Idolatry and of false goddes, and maketh wicked comuantys agrementes and promyses agaynst God. Some, for feare, doo forsake and deuye the Chrysten faith, and receyue the wycked popysh relygyon consentynge to manyfeste Idolatrye, and make God a lyar as though he could or woulde not helpe anye more in thys or that thyng, accyrdyng to hys manyfolde promyses in the old and newe testament.
               
                  
Furthermore impacyencye is augmen ted and increased thorow impacyency, so that a man that is vnpocient is euery day more sorowfull and desperate then other, fleyth and showeth where he shulde stedfastlye continue, and fyndeth neyther rest case nor quyetnes in hys harte. And manye one because he wyll not suffer and abyde pouerte and other lyke extreme necessyte, he falleth to naughtynes, murther, whoredome, lyenge, stealynge, extor cyon, ryot, cuttynge of pursys, & to suche other detestable abhomynacyon.
               Item they that be vnpacyent do enuye and dysdayne at others mēnes welth and prosperyte, for they ymagyne that to be the cause of theyr crosse and sorowe, and they frette agaynste it enuyenge dysdaynynge and hatynge oftymes, the inno cente wythoute anye cause, yea they rage and raue runnynge headelonge, to reuenge them selues. By the reason whereof oftetymes (as manye storyes do testyfye) contencyon, hatred, warre, vproure, sheddynge of bloude, decaye and destruc cyon of the churche, of relygyon, and of the comon welthe, haue rysen:

As Coriolianus, to reuenge hym selfe, as an enmy dyd procure warre agaynst hys own naturall contry.
               Besydes thys, it is an hygh honor and commendacyon before men, before the angels, paciēcy is a comendacyon & honor before men. before the holy sayntes, and also before god hym self, whan a man shewyth pacyence, boldnes and strength in aduersyte. And agayne whan a man behauyth hym self vnsemely, vnpacyentlye and desperatly, it is a shame and a dyshonor for hym both before all creatures, and also before the creator hym selfe. For it is no hygh nor hard thyng for a man to shewe a bold and a strong hart, and to be cōtent wyth Gods workyng, whan all thynges happen prosperouslye and accordynge to hys mynd: But this is a vertu & a poynt of connynge whan a mans mynde is not mouyd nor broken in aduersyte and mysfortune, Iob. i.
               Lyke as in a schole or a place of fence, he that hath shewed the most manly tow che, and hath wonne the victorye, hath greate commenda

                  yon and hyghe honor: Euen so is it much more commendable & a greater honor to ouercome and to subdue oure spyrytuall enemyes and to haue

the vyctorye agaynste the assaultys of the fleth and the deuyll. Be that forsaketh his bodyly maister wythoute a iuste cause, is taken before the world for a man that lacketh fayth, trueth and honesty: And shuld it not than be a greater poynte of dyshonestye and of vnfaythfulnes, in the tyme of afflyccyon vnder the crosse to forsake Christ and his word and thorow impacy ency to worke and to do against thesame?
               Prouer. xij. Be that subdewyth the tēptacions of the mynde is to be preferred & more to be commendyd than he that hath beseged & ouercome a strong cytye. For the which cause as well among the Christians as amonge the heathen dyuers notable parsons haue goten hygh commendacyon and prayse for their trustines fydelyte, & excellent constancy, whiche they haue shewed at an hassarde & at the tyme of nede.
               And specyally the example of oure sauyor Iesus Christe is to be consyderyd, wherof Paul makyth mencyon. Ro. viij. to thys end, sayinge: If Christe after hys afflyccion and obedience euen vnto death was exalted to hygh honor and glorye, It shall be a furtherance lykewyse vnto vs

to great honor, if we take our crosse dayly vpon vs and folow hym boldly & manly.
               Experyence teacheth also whan a man wyll shyft a way the crosse from hym by vnlawfull meanys, and wyll not wyth honesty and to hys commendacyon suffer it, for gods sake, oft tymes he is compellyd and dryuen by force to suffer as much or more wyth shame and dyshonestye for the deuyls sake, and to haue great dyshonor and confusyon thereby.
               Moreouer vnpacyente people do shortē theyr own lyues. Iudyth in the. viij. chapter paciēce is profytable for the lengthning of a mans lyfe. declaryth the storyes of the. xi. &. xxi. of the boke of nombers and sayeth, They that haue not taken their crosse and temptacyon in the feare of god. But thorowe murmuryng and grudgyng agaynst god haue shewed themselues vnpacyent, they were destroied of the destroyer, and were murtheryd of serpentes. And some thorow vnmeasurable sorow haue fallen into greuous dyseasys and deadly sycknesses, And gnawe and frett them selues to death, or els murther them seluys as king i. re. xxxi Saul dyd.
               Item whether a man doo suffer worthly or innocentlye if he contynewe in murmuryng

and vnpacyent, it seruyth to hys Paciēce may further a man to euerlastynge lyfe. eternall dampnacyon. And agayne whether a man suffer worthyly or innocently, if he take it pacyently as he ought to doo it is merytorios vnto hym, and a furtherance to euerlastynge lyfe. And all the sorowes and paynes vpon earth in respecte of the blesse and saluacion that is to come are but as the bytynge of a gnat or a flea, whych is easy to ouercome.
               Whan men in warrfare lyeng in camp wyl play ye sluggards & be slouthful, and ☞ not resyst the ennemyes stowtly and manfully their feldes are destroyed, theyr houses spoyled, their vyllages sett on fyre, theyr mannes parsonnes murtheryd and stayne, and theyr wyues and doughters defyled and rauyshed, and all goyth to hauock and is full of mysery. Euen so in the spyrytuall warrfare and feld, if we yeld vnto the flesh and the deuyll, and resyste them not manfullye and constantlye, we cast our selues into perpetual danger, mysery and vnquyetnes. But if we fyght agaynst eph. via the ghostly enemies stowtely and pacyently, we may atteyne to perpetuall rest and quyetnes.
               He that is syck, if he wyll not receyue

the medycyne, because it is bytter & sowr, or if he haue a sore or a wounde and wyll not suffer it to be searchyd and cutt & the corrupt flesh to be cut away, because it is very paynefull, It is no meruell nor won der if the same man perysh in his sycknes and dysease: But if he woulde suffer hym selfe to be handled after the mynd & coun cell of the physycyon or surgen, he myght ouercome the smart and payne and haue good hope to be curyd and remedyed and to be restored to hys helth agayn: Euen so all ryght and faythful Christyans that are pacyent in aduersyte may conceyue a muche more stedfaste & sure hope yt they shall atteyne to euerlastyng restitucion & helth of body & soule: Where as cōtrary wyse they which remayne & contynue in their frowardnes & impacyencye against god the heauenly physycyon, must smart for it euerlastyngly, both in body & sowl.

                  ast of al, pacyence is profytable and bryngeth syngular commodyte, not only to hym that hath the same vertue, but also to other people. For whan another perceyuyth thy constant trueth, fydelyte and stedfastnes, he taketh example and occasyon to exercyse lyke pacyence and stedfastnes.
               It is manyfest by dyuers true and cre dyble storyes whan as the Christians haue dyed manfullye and boldlye for the Christen fayeths sake, that certen of the persecutors and enemyes of Christe haue wonderyd so sore there at, that they by that and no nother occasyon were conuer tyd and turnyd to the fayth and relygyon of Christ.
               Item, pacyence and stedfastnes haue wroughte peace and quyetnes in comon welthys, in the church and in many nacions, cyteys and townys. As Scipio a wyse and noble ruler, for as muche as he dyd resrayne hym self and woulde rather forsake the cyte of Rome than to subdewe

and oppresse his ennemyes wyth force of armes, it turnyd to the syngular welth and commodyte of the whole comon welth. And contrarywyse a bytter, cruell and vnpacyente mynde, bryngyth, workyth and occasionyth infynite harme, destruccion in comon welthys & heresyes in the church of god. For Marius as he came agayne to Rome, and coulde not refrayne hym self, thorowe hys vnpacyentnes, wrought great tyrannye and shewed muche cruellnes, causynge dyuers of the pryncypall people of the contrarye parte that helde agaynste hym, moste cruellye to be murtheryd and put to death, wherevpon dyd folowe and insewe muche inconnenyence. Also Arrius, because he could not obteyne hys purpose nor bryng hys dyuyse to effect, for very frowardnes and impacyency he vexed and dysquyeted the church of Christ with horrible heresyes.
