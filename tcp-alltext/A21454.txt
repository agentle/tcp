A Proclamacion, concernyng their reuerent
talkes of the Sacrament.
               
                  WHere as the Kynges
highneſſe hath of late,
with the aſſent and conſent,
of the lordes Spirituall
and Temporal, and
the commons in the Parliament helde
the daie of in the firſt yere
of his moſte gracious reigne, made a

good and Godly Acte and Eſtatute, againſt
thoſe, who doth contempne, deſpiſe,
or with vnſemely and vngodly
woordes, depraue and reuile the holy
Sacrament of the body and bloud of
our lorde (commonly called the Sacramēt
of thaltar.) And theſame eſtatute
hath moſte prudently declared, by all
the wordes and termes, whiche, ſcripture
ſpeaketh of it, what is vndoubtedly
to bee accepted, beleued, taken
and ſpoken, by, and of theſaied Sacrament:
Yet this not withſtandyng, his
maieſtie is aduertiſed, that ſome of his
Subiectes, not contented, with ſuche
wordes and termes, as ſcripture doth
declare thereof, nor with that doctrine
which the holy ghoſt, by the Euangeliſtes
and Sainct Paule, hath taught
vs: do not ceaſe to moue, contencious
and ſuperfluous queſtions, of theſaied
holy Sacrament & ſupper of the lorde,
enteryng raſhly into the diſcuſſyng, of
the high miſtery thereof, and go about
in their ſermons or talkes, arrogantly
to define the maner, nature, faſhion,

waies, poſſibilitie or impoſſibilitie, of
thoſe matters whiche neither make to
edification, nor God hath not by his
holy worde opened. Whiche perſones
not contented reuerently and with obediēt
faithe, taccept that theſaid Sacrament,
accordyng to the ſaiyng of. S
Paule, the bread is the communion or
partakyng of the body of the lorde, the
Wine likewiſe, the partakyng of the
bloud of Chriſt, by the wordes inſtituted
and taught of Chriſt, and that the
body and bloud of Ieſu Chriſt is ther
whiche, is our comforte, thankes geuyng,
loue token of Chriſtes loue towardes
vs, and of oures as his members
within our ſelf, ſearcheth and
ſtriueth vnreuerētly, whether the body
and bloud, aforeſaied, is there really,
or figuratly, locally, or circūſcriptly,
and hauyng quantitie and greatenes,
or but ſubſtancially, and by ſubſtan̄ce
onely, or els but in a figure and
maner of ſpeakyng: whether his bleſſed
body be there, hedde, legges, armes
toes and nailes, or any other waies,

ſhape & maner, naked or clothed, whether
he is broken & chewed, or he is alwaies
whole, whether the bread there
remaineth, as we ſee, or how it departeth,
whether the fleſh be ther alone &
the bloud, or part, or ech in other or in
thone both, in thother but only bloud
& what bloud, yt only whiche did flow
out of the ſide, or that which remained
with other ſuch irreuerēt ſuperfluous
and curious queſtiōs, (whiche, how &
what, & by what meanes, and in what
forme) maie bryng into theim, which of
humain & corrupt curioſitie, hath deſire
to ſearche out, ſuche miſteries as lieth
hid in the infinite & botomles deapth of
the wiſedom & glory of god, and to the
whiche, our humain imbecillitie cānot
attain, & therefore, ofte tymes turneth
theſame to their awne & others deſtruccion,
by cōtencion & arrogant raſhnes,
whiche ſimple and Chriſtian affeccion
reuerently receiuyng and obediently
beleuing, without further ſearche, taketh
and vſeth to moſte great comfort
and profite. For reformacion whereof,

and to the intent that further contencion,
tumulte and queſtion, might not
riſe emonges the Kynges Subiectes:
The Kynges highnes, by the aduiſe
of the Lorde Protector, and other his
maieſties counſaill, ſtraightly willeth
and commaundeth, that no maner perſone
from hencefurthe, do in any wiſe
contenciouſly & openly argue, diſpute,
reaſon, preache or teache, affirmyng any
more termes, of theſaid bleſſed Sacrament,

the holy Scripture, and mencioned in
the forſaied act, nor deny none, whiche
bee therein conteined and mencioned,
vntill ſuche tyme as the kynges maieſtie,
by the aduiſe of his highnes counſaill,
and the Clergie of this realme,
ſhall define, declare and ſet furthe, an
open doctrine thereof, and what termes
and wordes, maie iuſtly be ſpoken
therby, other then be expreſſely in the
ſcripture, conteined in the Acte before
reherſed. In the meane while, the kinges
highnes pleaſure is, by the aduiſe
aforeſaied, that euery his louyng ſubiectes,

ſhall deuoutly and reuerently,
affirme and take that holy bread, to be
Chriſtes body, and that Cuppe, to bee
the cuppe of his holy bloud, accordyng
to the purport and effect of tholy ſcripture,
conteined in thact before expreſſed,
and accomodate theimſelf, rather
to take theſame Sacrament worthely
then raſhely to entre into the diſcuſſyng
of the high miſterie thereof. Yet
the kynges highnes mindeth not hereby,
to let or ſtoppe the ignoraunt, and
willyng to learne quietly, reuerently
and priuately, to demaunde of thoſe,
whom he thynketh knoweth more, the
further inſtruccion and teachyng, in
theſaid bleſſed Sacrament, ſo that the
ſame be not doen with contencion, nor
in open audience, with a company gathered
together about them, nor with
tumulte: Nor dooeth prohibite any
manne hereby, likewiſe ſo quietly, deuoutly
and reuerently, to teache or inſtructe
the weake and vnlearned, accordyng
to the more Talent and learnyng,
geuen to hym of God. But onely

that all contenciō, ſtrief and tumult
and irreuerentnes might be auoyded,
and in open audience or preachyng, nothyng
taught, but whiche maie haue
the holy ſcripture for warraunt, vpon
pein that whoſoeuer ſhall opēly, with
contencion or tumult, and in a company
gathered together, either in Churches,
Alehouſes, Markettes, or elles

of this Proclamacion, defende and

on the one part, or of the other, or any
ſuche like, or do otherwiſe reuile, contempne,
or diſpiſe theſaid Sacramēt,
by callyng it Idoll, or other ſuche vile

or to be otherwiſe greuouſly puniſhed
at his Maieſties will and pleaſure.
               Geuyng further in aucthoritee, to
all Iuſtices of Peace within the Shires,
where thei dwell, to apprehende
and take all ſuche as cōtenciouſly and

tumultuouſly, with companies or routes,

               The .xvi. daie of Ianuarij.
A Proclamacion for the abſteinyng
from fleſhe in the Lent tyme.
               
                  
                  THE Kynges highnes, by
the aduiſe of his moſte entierly
beloued vncle, Edward
duke of Somerſet,
Gouernor of his perſone,
and protector of all his realmes, dominions
and Subiectes, and other of his
priuie Counſaill, conſideryng that his
highnes, hath not onely cure & charge,
of the defence of his Realmes & dominions,
as a king, but alſo as a chriſtian
kyng, and ſupreme hed of the Churche
of Englande & Irelande, a deſire, will,
and charge to leade & inſtruct his people,
to him committed of God, in ſuche
rightes, waies and cuſtomes, as might
bee acceptable to God, and to the further
increaſe of good liuyng & vertue:
and that his Subiectes, now hauyng a
more perfect and clere light of the Goſpell
and true woorde of the lorde, thorowe
the infinite clemencie and mercie
of almightie God, by the handes of his
maieſtie, and his moſte noble father, of
famous memorie, promulgate, ſhewed
declared, and opened vnto thē, ſhould

and ought thereby, in all good workes
and vertues increaſe, be more forward
diligent and plentifull: As in faſtyng,
praier and almoſe deedes, in loue, charitee,
obedience, and other ſuche good
workes, commaunded to vs of God, in
his holy ſcripture: Yet his highnes is
aduertiſed and informed, that diuerſe
of his Subiectes, bee not onely to all
theſe more ſlowe and negligēt, but rather
contēpners and diſpiſers of ſuche
good and godly actes and deedes, to the
whiche, if thei wer of their awne myndes
bendid & inclined, thei neded not by
outward and princely power, bee appoyncted
and commaunded. But for ſo
muche as at this time now alate, more
then at any other tyme, a greate parte
of his ſubiectes, do breake & contempne
that abſtinence, whiche of long tyme
hath been vſed, in this his Maieſties
realme, vpon the Fridaies and Saterdaies,
and the tyme commonly called
Lent, and other accuſtomed times, his
highnes is conſtreined, to ſee a conuenient
order herein, ſet and appoincted:

Not myndyng thereby, that his Subiectes
ſhould thynke any difference, to
bee in the daies or meates, or that the
one ſhould be to God more holy, more
pure, or more cleane, then the other, for
all daies and all meates, be of one and
equall puritie, cleannes and holines,
that we ſhould in theim, and by them,
liue to the glory of God, and at all tymes,
and for all meates, geue thankes
vnto hym, of the whiche, none can defile
vs at any tyme, or make vs vnclene
beyng chriſtian men, to whom, al thinges
bee holy and pure, ſo that thei bee
not vſed, in diſobedience and vice: but
his maieſtie hath allowed, and approued
the daies and tymes, before accuſtomed,
to be continued and ſtil obſerued
here in this churche of Englande,
bothe that men ſhould on thoſe daies
abſtein and forbeare their pleaſures,
and the meates, wherein thei haue
more delight, to the intent to ſubdue
their bodies, vnto the ſoule and ſpirit,
vnto the whiche, to exhorte and moue
men, is the office of a good and Godly

hedde and ruler, and alſo for worldly
and ciuill pollicie, certain daies in the
yere, to ſpare Fleſhe and vſe Fiſhe, for
the benefit of the common wealth, and
profite of this his Maieſties realme,
whereof many be Fiſhers, and men vſyng
that trade of liuyng, vnto the
whiche, this realme on euery part, enuironed
with the Seas, and ſo plentifull
of freſhe waters, dooth eaſely miniſter
occaſion, to the great ſuſtenaūce
of this his highnes people, ſo that here
by, bothe the nouriſhment of the lande
might bee increaſed, by ſauyng fleſhe,
and ſpecially at the ſpryng tyme, when
Lent dooth commonly fall, and when
the moſte common and plenteous bredyng
of Fleſhe is: And alſo, diuerſe of
his louing ſubiectes, haue good liuynges,
and get greate riches thereby, in
vtteryng and ſellyng ſuche meates, as
the ſea and freſhe water doth miniſter
vnto vs, and this his maieſties realme
hath more plentie of Shippes, Boates
Crayers, and other veſſels, by reaſon
of thoſe, whiche by hope of lucre, dooe

folowe that trade of liuyng. Wherfore
his Maieſtie hauyng conſideracion,
that where men of their awne mindes,
do not geue theimſelfes, ſo oft as thei

Yet neuertheleſſe, his highnes is

acheuyng of theſame moſte Godly intent

that alſo his louyng Subiectes, in the

and ſo endeuor themſelf, that thei maie

And therefore, hath willed all his louyng

            Anno. III.
            
               The laſt daie of Ianuarij.
A Proclamacion for the prolongacion
of Teſtons.
               
                  WHere as the Kynges
moſte excellent maieſtie,
with the aduiſe
and aſſent of his dereſt
vncle, Edward duke
of Somerſet, Gouernor
of his royall perſone, Protector of
his highnes realmes, dominions, and
Subiectes, and the reſt of his graces
counſaill, hath heretofore by Proclamaciō,
beryng date the .x. daie of Aprill
in the ſecond yere of his reigne, geuen
notice and commaundement, to all maner
his louyng ſubiectes and others,
hauntyng his maieſties realmes or dominions,
that from the laſt daie of the
Moneth of December laſt paſſed forwardes,
the peces of .xij.d. commonly
called Teſtons, ſhould no lenger bee
curraunt, nor paſſe in paiment or receipt
as his graces coyne, but be taken
onely for bullion: whereunto his maieſtie
was moued vpon ſuche conſideracions,

as in theſaied former proclamacion,
was more at large expreſſed.
Foraſmuche as it hath ſithens come to
his highnes knowlege, that by reaſon
of the greate nomber of theſame Teſtōs,
whiche at this preſent are diſperſed
abrode, in ſo many mennes handes,
beſide no leſſe cautele and pollicie, vſed
euen hard vpō the daie by diuerſe, makyng
whole paimētes in theſaid coyne
and ſpecially for that, thoſe that haue
plentie of other money, take vnreaſonable
allowance of the poorer ſorte,
whiche is moſte to be relieued, for the
exchaunge of thoſe teſtons, muche detriment
and inconuenience ſhould enſue,
to the poſſeſſors of theſame, onles
a remedy by prolongyng of the terme
then appoyncted for their callyng in
were prouided: his maieſtie therefore,
by the aduiſe aforeſaid, is moſte graciouſly
pleaſed, willeth and commaundeth,
that the terme of the callyng of
theſaied peces of .xij.d. commonly called
Teſtons, ſhalbe yet further prolō
                  ged
and extended, to the firſt daie of

Maie nexte commyng, after the date
hereof. And that duryng all the meane
ſpace, theſaied Teſtons (beyng of his
highnes ſtanderd) ſhalbe currant thorowe
out his highnes realmes and dominions,
after no leſſe value and ſort,
then if theſaied former proclamacion,
for their callyng in had not been made.
               Prouided alwaies, that after theſaied
firſt daie of Maie, theſaied Teſtons
ſhall no lenger bee currant, but
bee vſed in ſuche ſorte, as that former
proclamaciō doth ſpecifie, this preſent
prolongacion notwithſtandyng.
               And further, his maieſtie exhorteth
all his ſaid louyng ſubiectes, that like
as his highnes for their benefite, was
moued to reuoke theſaid Teſtons, and
for their more commoditie is pleaſed,
to prolong the daie of their callyng in:
ſo thei alſo in the meane while, will
haue the better regard and hede, that
ſuche Teſtons as thei take, bee of his
maieſties ſtāderd and coyne, ſeyng the
nomber to be ſuche of falſe and forrein
teſtons, as are now ſo diſperſed abrode

to the deceipt and loſſe of the takers:
and that duryng this tyme of reſpite,
thei indeuour themſelfes from daie to
daie, by porcions and ſmaller ſomes,
to bryng in ſuche teſtons as thei ſhall
haue, into any his maieſties mintes, as
ſhall beſt ſerue for their purpoſe, there
to receiue the iuſt exchaunge of theſame:
ſo as by lyngeryng or deferryng
of the bryngyng in of ſuche Teſtons,
vntill theſaied firſt daie of Maie, limitted
by this peremptory admoniciō,
their negligence be not cauſe that whē
the mintes (if the whole maſſe come in
at once) are peſtered, their exchaunge
ſhall not be ſo ready vnto theim as otherwiſe
it ſhould.
               Moreouer, becauſe his Maieſtie
moſte graciouſly aboue other thynges
tenderyng the relief of the poorer ſort
of his louyng ſubiectes, doth conſider,
that their nede or vnhabilitee, to forbeare
by a ſpace (bee it neuer ſo ſmall)
the exchaunge of their Teſtons at his
graces Mintes, might be an occaſion
that others of the richer ſorte, with

whom thei ſhould perchaunce bee driuen
to bargain for other money, in lieu
of their Teſtons, ſhould then exacte or
take of theim vnreſonably, for the exchaunge
(as it hath comen to his highnes
knowlege, that ſome all redy haue
not been aſhamed to demaunde, & take
againſt all cōſcience and equitie.) His
highnes therefore, by the foreſaied aduiſe,
dooth ſtraightly charge and commaunde,
that no maner of perſone or
perſones, whatſoeuer thei be, do take
by any meanes, for the gain of the exchaunge
of any Teſtōs, aboue .ij.d. for
euery pound in Teſtons (whiche is .xx
s.) and after that rate, for ſmaller ſomes
in Teſtons, vpō pain of loſſe and
forfaicture of ſo muche money, or the
value thereof, as he or thei for any
higher rate of gain, in euery pounde or
ſmaller ſomes, ſhall haue deliuered in
exchaunge for teſtons to any perſone,
the one moytie therof to be applied to
his highnes, and the other to the partie
complainyng.
               And finally, his maieſties pleaſure

is, that betwene this and the firſt daie
of Maie aforeſaied, no maner perſone,
bee ſo hardy to refuſe in paimentes
greate or ſmall, any ſuche Teſtons of
his graces ſtandard, but ſhall accepte
theim no leſſe then other his highnes
coyne for the tyme, vpon pein aforſaid.
               In whiche behalf, his maieſtie likewiſe
chargeth all maner Maiors, ſhiriefes,
Baylifes, Iuſtices of Peace,
and others his graces officers and miniſters
of Iuſtice, that thei, or ſuche of
theim as by informacion of the partie
cōplainyng, ſhall haue due knowlege
hereof, faile not to ſe the whole effecte
of this penaltie executed, vpō the partie
complained on (if he be giltie) as otherwiſe
thei themſelfes ſhalbe Subiect
to the like daunger, vpon further
informacion againſt them geuen.
               Prouided alſo, that ſuche perſon or
perſones, as al redy haue collected together,
at other mennes handes, any
Teſtons for a gain, that is to ſaie, after
a leſſe rate and value, then thei
were currant, ſhall not by occaſion of

any thyng or clauſe herein contained,
otherwiſe vtter, diſpiſe, or put in vre,
any ſuche Teſtōs ſo by them collected
but ſhall onely bryng theim into the
Mintes without faylyng, as euery
ſuche offendors, beyng vpon like informacion
founde culpable, ſhall incurre
the like penaltie in eche behalfe, as is
before expreſſed.
            
            
               The .xix. daie of Februarij.
A Proclamacion concernyng Pirates
and robbers of the Sea.
               
                  THe multitude of Piracies
and Robberies
on the Seas, beyng of
late greatly increaſed
to the Kynges Maieſties
high diſpleaſure,
and no ſmall ſlaunder of this his highnes
realme, by reaſon that ſuche perſones,
who had the chief care & charge
thereof, and ſhould moſte eſpecially
haue ſeen theſame redreſſed and amended,
hath rather been concealors or
mainteiners of ſuche Piracies, as of
late (by the grace of God) it hath been
reuealed and doth appere: his maieſtie

therefore, by the aduiſe of the Lorde
Protector, and the reſt of his highnes
counſaill, moſte earneſtly myndyng to
procede with all care and force, againſt
theſaied Pirates and Sea Robbers:
and to cauſe his Lawes more ſeuerely
to be executed, leſt perauenture any of
his louyng Subiectes, ſhould either
ignorauntly fall into daungier, or willyngly
pretende ignoraunce of his Lawes,
dooth by this his maieſties Proclamacion,
ſtraightly charge and commaunde,
that no maner of perſone or
perſones, do by any colour or pretence
from hencefurthe, receiue, aide, ſuccor,
releue, defende, conceale, or abbet any
maner of Pirat or Pirates, whatſoeuer
thei bee, either on the ſeas, or in any
Porte, Hauen, Creke, or any other
toune of the kynges maieſties, or in any
other place, within his Maieſties
realmes and dominions, by ſea or land
vpō pain that whoſoeuer ſhall offende,
contrary to this Proclamacion, ſhalbe
taken for a Pirate or fautor of thē,
and ſuffre ſuche paines of death, loſſe

of goodes, and forfaictures, as the Pirates
theimſelfes or their fautors, by
the Lawes of this Realme, ſhould or
ought to do. And whatſoeuer perſone
or perſones, ſhall buye of any Pirate,
or by any other fraude or couyn, ſhall
wittyngly take any maner of gooddes
or marchaundiſes, Piratically taken,
or conceale theſame: the perſone ſo offendyng,
to bee taken for a receiuor of
Pirates, and ſo iudged, and ſuffre accordyng
to the Lawes of this realme.
And whoſoeuer hereafter ſhall buy or
take by exchaunge, or any other colour
any gooddes of any Pirate, or whiche
were Piratically taken: The kynges
highnes, by the aduiſe aforeſaied, further
willeth that the perſon ſo takyng
ſuche gooddes, as aforeſaied, ſhall not
onely be compelled to deliuer theſaied
gooddes and Marchaundiſes, to the
true owners of theſaid gooddes, without
any recompence therefore, if thei
require theſame, but alſo bee further
puniſhed by impriſonmēt or otherwiſe
at his highnes pleaſure. And for the

better repreſſyng of the like robberies
and Piracies hereafter, his Maieſtie
willeth and requireth, all and euery
his maieſties louyng ſubiectes, to endeuour
theimſelfes, to the beſt of their
powers, to apprehende and take theſaied
Pirates, by all waies and meanes
thei maie, whereby, thei ſhall not
onely ſhew themſelfes good ſubiectes
to his Maieſtie, but alſo be well aſſured
to be further rewarded, and conſidered
of his Maieſtie, in ſuche ſort, as
thei ſhall haue good cauſe to bee well
contented: wherfore, his highnes willeth
and commaundeth, all Iuſtices of
Peace, all Maiors, Shiriefes, Coneſtables,
Hedborowes, portereues, and
al his officers and miniſters, to ſe this
proclamacion executed and performed
accordyng to the true meanyng thereof,
without any parcialitie or fauor, as
thei tender the kynges maieſties pleaſure,
and will auoyde the contrary at
their vttermoſte perilles.

A Proclamacion concernyng Purueiours.
               
               
                  WHereas at the humble
ſute of our louyng ſubiectes,
in our late parliament,
we haue condeſcended

and the reſt of our priuie counſail
to forbeare to make any prouiſions, by
any our Purueiors or Takers, but in
ſuche ſorte, and for ſuche tymes, as in
an acte made in our ſaied Parliament
for that purpoſe, doth more plainly appere:
beyng now mynded, not onely to
put theſaid act in execucion, accordyng
to the effect and true meanyng of theſame,
but alſo to geue order, that ſuche
ſomes of money, as is due to any our
Subiectes, for any thynges heretofore
taken to our vſe, by any our ſaied purueiors
and Takers, we haue thought
conuenient to will and require, al and
euery of our louyng ſubiectes, within
this our Countie of to whom

any money is iuſtly due by vs, for thinges

awne names, their dwellyng place,
and the debt, and the thynges whereof
the debt riſeth, with the names and times,
alſo by whom, and when theſame
thynges were taken. And furthermore
our pleaſure and commaundement is,
that the Shirief of our ſaied Countie,
for the yere beeyng, ſhall receiue all
ſuche billes of debtes, as ſhalbe before
theſaied feaſt of. S. Michaell, brought
vnto hym, and deliuer ſafely within .xx

as concerne our debtes, for any other
our prouiſions, to the handes of the
Threaſaurer, and Barons of our Exchequer,
or their deputies for that purpoſe,
without failyng thereof, as thei

their perill: wherupon, we mynd ſhortly
after God willyng, to geue ſuche
order, for the ſatiſfaccion of our good
Subiectes, as ſhall ſtande with good
reaſon, equitie and Iuſtice.

               The .vi. daie of Aprill.
A Proclamacion for the reformacion
of light horſemenne.
               WHere as it is come to the
knowlege, of the Kynges
moſt excellēt maieſtie, that emōges
other diſorders of late
tyme, crept into the aunciēt diſcipline
of warre, heretofore obſerued mooſte
ſtraightly, by the Subiectes of this
realme, as the chiefeſt cauſe of ſo many
victories, whiche, by meanes thereof
haue riſen to theſame: there is a notable

and perillous ſorte, of deceipt and
breche of that diſcipline, vſed aſwel by
capitaines, as ſouldiors enterteined in
his highnes wages, and ſpecially ſuch
capitaines of lighthorſemen, and thoſe
of their bandes, beyng of the Counties
of Northumberlande, Cumberlande,
Weſtmerlande and other places of the
borders, as for defence of theſame, are
enterteined ſtill in wages, to his Maieſties
no ſmall charge, and expence of
threaſure: whiche capitaines, hauyng
not ſo muche before their iyes, their
duetie toward their ſoueraigne Lorde
and Coūtrey, nor yet their awne ſureties,
as a vile mynde, and filthy reſpect
to their awne gain, by deceiuyng of his
highnes, and pollyng of the ſouldiors,
without ſhame or drede, dooe not onely
diminiſhe their nombers, appoyncted
to ſerue vnder theim (ſauyng that for a
coloure at the Muſter daie, thei haue
ſome others to ſupply the voyde places)
but alſo by pattiſhment with vnmete
and vnſeruiſable men, for a leſſe
wages then his highnes alloweth, do

in ſuche ſorte diſguiſe their nombers
(contrary to his highnes expectacion,
and truſt repoſed in theim) as in a maner
the thirde parte of the nombers,
whiche his maieſtie appoyncteth & payeth
for, is not redy, able, or ſufficiētly
furniſhed to do that ſeruice, whiche is
looked for to the greate deceipt of his
maieſtie, and no leſſe daunger of ſuche
other his highnes true Subiectes and
ſouldiors, as vpon confidence of thaide
of ſuche light horſemen, to ioyne with
them at any encoūtre with the enemy,
finde themſelfes deceiued and abandoned.
Accordyng to the which ſaid moſt
naughtie and ſhamefull behauiour of
ſuche capitaines, the ſouldiors in like
ſorte, that are of their bandes, takyng
thereat example and boldnes, doo neither
prouide themſelfes of horſe or harnes,
mete to ſerue withall, nor yet beyng
commaunded to ſet furthe, towardes
any place of ſeruice, do repaire thether
togethers, but ſomtime more then
the halfe part remaineth behinde, or if
thei go, ſticke not to returne home by

ſmall companies without leaue, with
ſeuerall praies & booties, more ſought
of thē then ſeruice. And that is wourſt
of all, at any approche or affronture of
the enemie, without order, or reſpecte
of abidyng by the ſtanderd, doo vſe comonly
vpō euery litle moment, or cauſeles,
to beginne the flight, betraiyng
their felowes, whiche, through ſuche
their fliyng loſe often tymes, that aſſured
aduauntage of victorie, whiche
with their tariyng, thei might bothe
haue been partakers of. And moreouer
if ſo be thei tary, thei do it not ſo much
for diſcharge of their profeſſion of ſeruice,
as onely for deſire of ſpoyle and
pillage, whiche pillage thei ſeke not ſo
muche vpon the enemies, as rather vpon
his highnes awne ſubiectes or frē
                  des,
namely the aſſured Scottiſhmen,
whoſe gooddes and cattals, diuerſe of
thoſe light horſemen of Northumberlande,
and others of the borders, haue
of late moſte rauenouſly ſpoyled and
robbed, as by ſundery complaintes of
ſuche aſſured menne, it hath been touched:

his maieſtie therefore, myndyng
the reformacion hereof, by thaduiſe of
his dereſt vncle and con̄ſailor, the duke
of Somerſet, gouernor of his perſone,
and protector of his maieſties realmes
dominiōs and ſubiectes, and the reſt of
his highnes priuie coūſaill, hath determined,
& ſtraightly chargeth and commaundeth,
all and ſinguler the capitaines
of any bandes, or nombers of light
horſemen, & ſpecially capitaines of any
bādes, or nomber of light horſemen beyng
of the countie of Northūberlande,
or any other Countie or place, vpon any
the borders a

               The .xxij. daie of Maie.
A Proclamacion for the adnichilatyng
of Teſtons.
               
                  WHere as the Kynges
Maieſtie, by thaduiſe
of his moſte dere vncle
the lorde Protector, &
the reſt of his highnes
Counſaill, for diuerſe
greate and vrgent conſideracions, had
commaunded that all maner of perſones,
ſhould bryng all coyne, commonly
called Teſtons, coyned with the face
and ſtampe, of his highnes moſte dere
father, the late kyng Henry the eight,
before the feaſt of Chriſtmas laſt paſt,

into the Toure of Lōdon, or other his
Maieſties Mintes, to the intent theſame
might be exchaūged into ſhillynges,
Grotes, or other kynd of moneis:
it hath ſo chaunſed that by reaſon, aſwell
of the multitude of that coyne,
heretofore made in the tyme of theſaid
late kyng, his maieſties father, as alſo
by the great quantite and foiſon of the
ſame coyne, coūterfaicted and brought

all theſaid Teſtons hath not be chaū

And therupon his highnes, by the

and ſuffered theſaied coyne of
Teſtons, to bee currant emonges his

the conſideracions in theſaied Proclamacion
expreſſed, euery manne for his
part helpyng that waies, all maner of
theſaied Teſtons, of the ſtampe of theſaied
late Kyng of famous memorie,
ſhould haue ben brought into the mintes

& exchaunged. In the whiche ſpace
yet many abuſyng his highnes clemency,
hath kept their teſtons ſtill in their
hādes, or otherwiſe vttered them, and
fewer ſithens that tyme, till nowe of
late haue been brought into his highnes
Mintes. The whiche Teſtons, if
thei ſhould nowe remain onely mere
bullion, ſhould be great loſſe and hinderaunce
to his Maieſties ſubiectes:
and if theſame ſtaie or Proclamacion,
ſhould in any wiſe be releaſed, it ſhuld
be greateſt loſſe and hynderaūce to the
realme, and a preſent occaſion of continuall
bryngyng in more counterfaict
Teſtons: therefore the kynges Maieſtie,
by the aduiſe of the lorde Protectour,
and the reſt of his highnes counſaill,

of any maner of perſone: And yet

neuertheleſſe, of his mooſte Princely
clemencie and liberalitie, his highnes
by thaduiſe aforeſaied, is content that
al ſuche ſomes of money, as ſhalbe due
to his Maieſtie, aſwell for the Relief,
graunted in the laſt Seſſions of the
Parliament, as for all other Rentes
and debtes, maie be paied in good and

of his maieſties father, at any time before

and ſo receiued of his highnes Threaſurers,
vntil theſaid firſt of Iune next
folowyng onely, after the rate and value

tyme, his highnes pleaſure is, that
in no wiſe theſaid teſtons, be any more
receiued, of any his highnes officers
of receipte, of, or for that price. Neuertheles,
for the ſpace and tyme of twoo
Monethes after, that is to ſaie, vnto
the ende and laſt daie of Iuly next folowyng,
his highnes is content, that
all good and lawfull Teſtons, at his
maieſties Mintes, ſhalbe receiued for
bullion, after the rate of .xij. d. the pece

of any perſone, who ſhall bryng theim
thether. And further, that it ſhalbe lefull
to any man, to buye any good and
lawfull Teſtons, of theſaid coyne and
ſtampe, of the late kyng, and made in any
of the Mintes, within this realme
of Englande, to that intent to bryng
them to the Mintes, of any perſon not
diſpoſed to bryng them himſelf: ſo that
he do buye them for no leſſe price, then
after .xi. d. ob. the pece, and not vnder,
vpō pain that whoſoeuer, for his awne
gredines and lucre, ſhal buy any ſuche
Teſtons, for leſſe value then after .xi. d
ob. the pece, to the domage of the poore
men, who would ſell theſame, ſhal forfaict
therefore the Teſtons ſo bought,
and tenne tymes the value of theim,
whereof one moytie to the kynges maieſtie,
the other to the demaunder of the
ſaied forfaict, by bill, accion of debt, or
informaciō, in any of the kynges maieſties
Courtes of Record, where no eſſone,
Proteccion nor wager of lawe,
ſhal ſerue or be allowed. And his highnes
further is content, that all his officers

and Miniſters, maie receiue all
ſuche good and lawfull Teſtons, and
ſo repaie them again vnto his highnes
after theſaied price of .xi. d. ob. the pece
duryng onely theſaied Monethes, of
Iune and Iuly. In the whiche tyme,
for that price of .xi. d. ob. the pece, thei
ſhall refuſe no lawfull and good Teſtons,
of any his highnes ſubiectes. After
the whiche laſt daie of the monethe
of Iuly nexte folowyng, his highnes
expreſſe will and pleaſure, by thaduiſe

A Proclamacion pardonyng certain

                  WHere as of late, the
Kynges maieſtie moued
of a Godly zeale,
and loue to the commō
wealth of the realme,
by the aduiſe of his dereſt
vncle, Edward duke of Somerſet
Gouernor of his highnes perſone, and
Protector of all his Realmes, Dominions
and ſubiectes, and the reſt of his
maieſties priuie counſaill, did by Proclamacion,
will and commaūde, al maner
of perſones, who had offended againſt
the good and wholeſome lawes
heretofore prouided, againſt the decaie
of houſes, and vnlawfull encloſures,
to amende their ſuche offences, and to
redreſſe all faultes by theim committed,
againſt theſaid actes and ſtatutes,
and againſt the benefite of the commō
wealth, vpon pain to encurre the daū
                  gers
and paines, in theſaied actes and
ſtatutes prouided: And for the better
performaunce thereof, by the aduiſe aforeſaied,
willed and commaunded, all
his highnes officers and Miniſters, to

whom it did appertain, to ſee theſame
redreſſed, to receiue informacions,
make inquirie, and with all ſpede and
earneſt endeuor, ſe to the redreſſe and
puniſhment of all ſuche offendors, as
by the lawes & ſtatutes of the realme,
thei might and ought to do. Vpō this
moſte Godly warnyng, admoniſhemēt
and Proclamaciō, whiche was to kepe
order and lawes, his highnes is aduertiſed,
that a greate nomber of rude and
ignoraunt people, in certain Shires of
Englande, hath taken occaſion, or at
the leaſt pretended to take occaſion, of
dooyng greate and moſte perilous and
heinous diſorder, and contrary to all
good lawes and ſtatutes, and the order
of this Realme, haue rioteouſly with
Routes and compaignies, with force,
ſtrength and violence, of their awne
hedde and aucthoritie, aſſembled theim
ſelfes, plucked doune mennes hedges
diſparked their parkes, and beyng led
by furious and light guydes of vprore,
taken vpon them the direccion of thinges,
the kynges royall power & ſworde

and committed ſuche enormitie and
offence, as thei haue iuſtly therefore,
merited the loſſe of life, landes & gooddes,
and to bee made example to all other:
But for ſo muche, as thei haue
humbly ſubmitted theimſelf, and demaunded
pardon, beyng ſory for their
former offences: the kynges highnes,
of a mooſte high clemencie, and tender
loue to his ſubiectes, is content not to
loke vpon his Iuſtice herein to be executed,
but muche more of natural mercie
and clemencie, toward his ſaied louyng
Subiectes, and ſo for this tyme,
acceptyng that this outrage, was doen
rather of folly, and of miſtakyng theſaied
Proclamacion, and at the inſtigaciō
and mocion, of certain leude and
ſedicious perſons, then of malice or any
eiuill will, that his Subiectes did
beare, either to his highnes, or to the
quiet of this realme, of his Maieſties
moſte aboundaunt clemencie, & tender
pitie towardes his ſubiectes, by the
aduiſe of theſaid lode Protector, and
the reſt of his highnes priuie counſaill

is contented and pleaſed, to remit and
pardon, all theſaied outragies, miſbehauours,
riottes and conſpiracies, to
all and ſinguler his Subiectes, other
then to ſuche, as be already apprehended
and in priſō, as heddes and ſtirrers
of theſaied outrage and riottes, and
therefore, willeth and commaundeth,

bailifes, and al other his highnes officers
and miniſters, not to enterrupt,

behalfe, any maner perſone, other
then is ſpecified before, of, or for any
offence, iniury, contempt or conſpiracy
doen at theſaied ſtirre or riottes, lately
made, aboute the breakyng of encloſures,
ſo that thei do not attempt or go
aboute, any ſuche thyng hereafter: but
if ſo be there be any iuſt cauſe, to complain
for default of Iuſtice, or lacke of
redreſſe in any ſuche incloſure or default,
made againſt theſaied Actes and
Statutes, before ſpecified in this caſe
prouided, thei, who finde theimſelf iuſtly
greued or iniuried, maie geue informacion,

make ſute or complaint to
the kynges maieſtie, or other his highnes
officers, deputed to the redreſſe of
all ſuche offences, accordyng to the lawes
of the realme, and the good & lawfull
order of theſame: But if any man,
ſhall at any time hereafter, attempt to
make or go aboute to make, any ſuche
riot or vnlawfull aſſēbly, for any ſuche
cauſe before reherſed, his Maieſties
will and pleaſure is, by the aduiſe aforeſaid,
that all ſuche offendors ſhall
immediatly be apprehēded, by the next
Iuſtice or Iuſtices of Peace, and loſe
the benefit of this moſte gracious pardon,
and ſuffre ſuche paines of death,

by the Lawes of the Realme, in ſuche
caſe is prouided, any thyng in this preſent

               THe kynges Maieſtie, hauyng

the whiche cauſe, almightie God hath
geuen to his maieſtie power to rule, &
to all his people hath enioyned, lowlynes
to obeye, certainly vnderſtandeth,
by thinformacion & good aduiſe, of his
moſte dere vncle Edward duke of Somerſet,
Gouernor of his moſte royall
perſone, and Protector of his realmes
Dominions and ſubiectes, and others
of his priuie counſail: that of late time
the prices of all maner victuall, neceſſary
for mānes ſuſtenaūce, be ſo heightened
and raiſed, aboue the accuſtomed
and reaſonable values, that therby
(except ſpedy remedy bee prouided)
very greate loſſe and dammage, muſte
nedes chaunce to his maieſties louyng

wherewith his maieſtie vſeth to

and of pitie, whiche at all tymes, his

ſtudy, of his ſaid dere vncle, the
lorde Protector, and the reſt of his priuey
counſaill, concluded and finally reſolued,

to prouide remedy herein, the
whiche (reſtyng vpon the former redreſſe
of ſondery diſorders, in the whole
common welth) although it cānot be ſo
abſolutly & ſpedely had as his maieſties
moſte hartie deſire is, yet it is thought
by his Maieſtie, for the preſent diſorders,
a greate relief to put in due execucion,
diuerſe good lawes and ſtatutes,
prouided heretofore, by aucthoritie
of Parliament, in the reignes of the
kynges maieſties moſte noble progenitors,
and eſpecially twoo pollitique
good eſtatutes, made at Weſtminſter
in the .xxv. yere of the reigne of his maieſties
moſte dere father late deceaſſed,
kyng Henry the eight, ordeined, as by
theſame appereth, very pollitiquely,
for the redreſſe of theſe like diſorders of

reaſonable prices of all kyndes of victualles,
mencioned in theſaid act, how

for relief of the kynges ſubiectes
and that after ſuche prices, ſet and taxed
in forme aforeſaied, Proclamacion
ſhould be made in the Kynges name,
vnder the greate ſeale, of theſaid prices
in ſuche parties of this realme, as
ſhould be conuenient for theſame.
               And it was further enacted, by theſaid

eſtatute, that all fermors, owners
broggers & all other victualers whatſoeuer,
hauyng and kepyng any of the

of Motton, ſo that in default thereof,
the people happe to haue ouer muche

realmes, dominions, and ſubiectes,

conſidereth, that as it is the fruite of
his mercie, to receiue his humble, repentant,
& ſorowfull ſubiectes, knowleging
their offices, to the benefite and

of his maieſties mercie, to defende,

whiche ſubmitteth theimſelfes, to his

with their quiete, as thei haue

his maieſtie, by the aduiſe aforſaid,
willeth, admoniſheth, and commaundeth,
firſt, all maner of his ſubiectes,
whiche of late, by their humble ſubmiſſion,

vnlawfull and rioteous aſſēbles: that
thei from hencefurth, be of ſuche good
behauior, in the peace of God, and the

A Proclamacion, for the execucion

               FOR as muche, as the Kynges
Maieſtie hath of late, for
the redreſſe of vnlawfull encloſures,
and ſuche like enormities,
directed his ſeuerall Commiſſions,
with large inſtruccions for theſame,
into euery his counties, not onely
aucthoriſyng his Commiſſioners, to
redreſſe and reforme al maner of thynges,
ſo farre furth as the lawes could
any wiſe be conſtrued or expoūded, but
alſo by ſpeciall his Maieſties Letters
Miſſiue, hath charged theſame Commiſſioners,
vpon greate pain, in theſame
letters conteined, to redreſſe and
amēde their awne proper faultes, whiche
Commiſſions bee now part in execucion,
and part ready to be executed,
and delayed onely, by the folly of the
people, ſekyng their awne redreſſe vnlawfully:
So that no ſubiect, can any

more require of any prince, then by his
maieſtie, his ſaid vncle, & coūſaill hath
been deuiſed, ordred & commaūded. Yet
neuertheles, his maieſtie vnderſtandeth
that diuerſe of his Subiectes, neither
cōſidryng how thei be ordeined by God
to be ſubiectes and obey, nether regardyng
their ſoueraigne lordes moſt earneſt

and daily declareth to his cōmon
welth neither hauyng in remēbraunce
what diſtruccion it is to themſelfes, to

one ſubiect and another, do attēpt and

attempt, that which ought onely to be
doen, by thaucthoritie of the kyng, and
his maieſties lawes, yea, & in many poinctes,
accordyng to the eiuil diſpoſiciō
of their aſſemblers, attempt with violēce

& fury, ſuche vnlawfull thynges,
as be extremely forbidden, by all iuſtice
and lawe, & to be abhorred of any good
Chriſtian: For the whiche cauſes, his
Maieſtie, neither of good Iuſtice and
honour, neither for the eſtate and ſafe
garde, of his highnes Realme, will, or
maie endure his ſubiectes, ſo to offend
without preſent puniſhement and correccion:
But as a Prince reignyng by
almightie Goddes prouidence, mooſte

aduiſe of his ſaied dere vncle, the lorde
Protector, and the reſt of his maieſties
priuie counſaill, ſtraightly chargeth,
