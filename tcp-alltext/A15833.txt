                  To the Right Worshipfull & True louer of Musicke, Syr Henry Lennard KNIGHT.
                  NO one science draweth neerer to the essence of God, then this of Musicke. (For as God is altogether vnitie: So is Musicke proportionably an harmoniacall vnitie.) No man fauours men of that qualitie beyond your selfe. To no man am I more deepely beholding then to your good selfe. Lo then; In all these respects, and without all further ceremony, I heere present to your good iudgement this second Booke of MVSICA TRANSALPINA. Which (as well vpon the gracious acceptance of my first one,) As also the encouragement of sundry ciuill Gentlemen, and Marchants of good sorte) I haue carefully culled out of the Compositions of the best Authors in Italy. Perhaps they speake not English so well as they sing Italian. And (alas) how colde they, beeing as yet but late soiourners in England? Howbeeit I humbly desire, your selfe principally, and in your name all others for whose delight they were intended, to supply their defects with friendly interpretation. And so, humblie bowing my selfe, I rest.
                  
                     At your deuotion wholly and euer Nicolas Yonge.

                  To the Right Worshipfull & True louer of Musicke, Syr Henry Lennard KNIGHT.
                  NO one science draweth neerer to the essence of God, then this of Musicke. (For as God is altogether vnitie: So is Musicke proportionably an harmoniacall vnitie.) No man fauours men of that qualitie beyond your selfe. To no man am I more deepely beholding then to your good selfe. Lo then; In all these respects, and without all further ceremony, I heere present to your good iudgement this second Booke of MVSICA TRANSALPINA. Which (as well vpon the gracious acceptance of my first one,) As also the encouragement of sundry ciuill Gentlemen, and Marchants of good sorte) I haue carefully culled out of the Compositions of the best Authors in Italy. Perhaps they speake not English so well as they sing Italian. And (alas) how colde they, beeing as yet but late soiourners in England? Howbeeit I humbly desire, your selfe principally, and in your name all others for whose delight they were intended, to supply their defects with friendly interpretation. And so, humblie bowing my selfe, I rest.
                  
                     At your deuotion wholly and euer Nicolas Yonge.

                  To the Right Worshipfull & True louer of Musicke, Syr Henry Lennard KNIGHT.
                  NO one science draweth neerer to the essence of God, then this of Musicke. (For as God is altogether vnitie: So is Musicke proportionably an harmoniacall vnitie.) No man fauours men of that qualitie beyond your selfe. To no man am I more deepely beholding then to your good selfe. Lo then; In all these respects, and without all further ceremony, I heere present to your good iudgement this second Booke of MVSICA TRANSALPINA. Which (as well vpon the gracious acceptance of my first one,) As also the encouragement of sundry ciuill Gentlemen, and Marchants of good sorte) I haue carefully culled out of the Compositions of the best Authors in Italy. Perhaps they speake not English so well as they sing Italian. And (alas) how colde they, beeing as yet but late soiourners in England? Howbeeit I humbly desire, your selfe principally, and in your name all others for whose delight they were intended, to supply their defects with friendly interpretation. And so, humblie bowing my selfe, I rest.
                  
                     At your deuotion wholly and euer Nicolas Yonge.

                  To the Right Worshipfull & True louer of Musicke, Syr Henry Lennard KNIGHT.
                  NO one science draweth neerer to the essence of God, then this of Musicke. (For as God is altogether vnitie: So is Musicke proportionably an harmoniacall vnitie.) No man fauours men of that qualitie beyond your selfe. To no man am I more deepely beholding then to your good selfe. Lo then; In all these respects, and without all further ceremony, I heere present to your good iudgement this second Booke of MVSICA TRANSALPINA. Which (as well vpon the gracious acceptance of my first one,) As also the encouragement of sundry ciuill Gentlemen, and Marchants of good sorte) I haue carefully culled out of the Compositions of the best Authors in Italy. Perhaps they speake not English so well as they sing Italian. And (alas) how colde they, beeing as yet but late soiourners in England? Howbeeit I humbly desire, your selfe principally, and in your name all others for whose delight they were intended, to supply their defects with friendly interpretation. And so, humblie bowing my selfe, I rest.
                  
                     At your deuotion wholly and euer Nicholas Yonge.

                  To the Right Worshipfull & True louer of Musicke, Syr Henry Lennard KNIGHT.
                  NO one science draweth neerer to the essence of God, then this of Musicke. (For as God is altogether vnitie: So is Musicke proportionably an harmoniacall vnitie.) No man fauours men of that qualitie beyond your selfe. To no man am I more deepely beholding then to your good selfe. Lo then; In all these respects, and without all further ceremony, I heere present to your good iudgement this second Booke of MVSICA TRANSALPINA. Which (as well vpon the gracious acceptance of my first one,) As also the encouragement of sundry ciuill Gentlemen, and Marchants of good sorte) I haue carefully called out of the Compositions of the best Authors in Italy. Perhaps they speake not English so well as they sing Italian. And (alas) how colde they, beeing as yet but late soiourners in England? Howbeeit I humbly desire, your selfe principally, and in your name all others for whose delight they were intended, to supply their defects with friendly interpretation. And so, humblie bowing my selfe, I rest.
                  
                     At your deuotion wholly and euer Nicholas Yonge.

                  To the Right Worshipfull & True louer of Musicke, Syr Henry Lennard KNIGHT.
                  NO one science draweth neerer to the essence of God, then this of Musicke. (For as God is altogether vnitie: So is Musicke proportionably an harmoniacall vnitie.) No man fauours men of that qualitie beyond your selfe. To no man am I mere deepely beholding then to your good selfe. Lo then; In all these respects, and without all further ceremony, I heere present to your good iudgement this second Booke of MVSICA TRANSALPINA. Which (as well vpon the gracious acceptance of my first one,) As also the encouragement of sundry ciuill Gentlemen, and Marchants of good sorte) I haue carefully called out of the Compositions of the best Authors in Italy. Perhaps they speake not English so well as they sing Italian. And (alas) how colde they, beeing as yet but late soiourners in England? Howbeeit I humbly desire, your selfe principally, and in your name all others for whose delight they were intended, to supply their defects with friendly interpretation. And so, humblie bowing my selfe, I rest.
                  
                     At your deuotion wholly and euer Nicholas Yonge.
