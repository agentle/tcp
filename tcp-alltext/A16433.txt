                  DEarely and welbeloued, The tediouſneſſe of this inward war & deſolation which this Countrey hath ſuſtayned, haue giuen you ſufficiently to vnderſtād, and as it were palpably to feele the ſmall duty that you ow vnto the cauſers of the ſame, who in reſpect of their own paſſions and perticuler intereſt, haue procured the deſtruction of the poore people. It is not therefore neceſſarye to repeat vnto you all ſuch things as haue paſſed ſince the beginning of theſe troubles, ſith euen the moſte ignorant haue euidently perceiued that the ſtirrers vp of theſe wars bent not their indeauour to the maintainance of common commodity and quiet, but rather to whatſoeuer tended to the perticularities of their dāgerous deuiſes.

For in caſe wee ſhould begin to rip vp their dealings we ſhould finde firſt that the late of Orange ſought no other but a continuall confuſion of all things, and neuer cared for ſuccoring any one of thoſe towns which my L. the Kings army beſieged & cōquered. The like may we report of ye Frenche, for your ſelues are to teſtifie how they purpoſed to entreat your wiues and children in recompence of ſuch and ſo many honoures as you ſtrained your ſelues to heape vpon them. Now that God hath ben ſerued in calling out of this world as wel the one as ye other, and that thereby you doe on the one ſide find your forces decay, and on the other do perceaue your Kings greate power togither with ſuch happy ſucceſſe as it pleaſeth God the Creator dayly to graunt vnto him to increaſe, it were more then time for you to haue ſome reſpect to your own ſafegard, & the diſcommodity of your pore people

oppreſſed & enuironed with ſo manye miſchiefs, wherevnto in the end they ſhal be forced to ſtoope. A Cauſe that being moued by priuate zeale whiche we beare to the countrey, as well in reſpect of the place from whence wee be diſcended, as alſo of ſuch courteſies as we there taſted in our youth, wee haue hertofore by our letters endeuored to repreſent vnto you, euen as wel to you perticulerly, as alſo generallye to al other ye townes & prouinces ſuch meanes as in God and our conſciences, did vnto vs ſeeme moſt expedient for the reſtoring of the whole country to peace and quietnes, but in as much as the late of Orange and others (who ſought only by the deſtruction of the country & blood of ſo many innocents to intrude thēſelues into the gouernmente and dominion of the ſame) did wickedly deteine & ſuppreſſe our ſayd letters, we thought it good now for a final concluſion to write yet this one

vnto you, wherin we deſire you with al feruēcy & zeale poſſible to take pitty vpon your wiues, children, & deſolate countrie. Once againe call to remembrance & loke back vpon ſuch reſt and felicitie as euery mā hertofore did enioy vnder the obedience of his Maieſtie, & contrariwiſe conſider of the deſtruction and extremitie wherinto at this preſent your countrey is reduced, which yet daily (if the war continue) wil more & more encreaſe, vnto ye very tipe & vttermoſt periode of the ſame. Hēceforth ſtop your eares againſt the lying inuentions & ſuttle perſwaſions of thoſe which do maintain & feed you with this error of miſtruſt of the goodneſſe & ſincerity of the king your naturall prince, which neuertheles is ſuch that notwithſtanding the iniuries be bitter & hard to digeſt, yet doth he not ſtand vpon thē, but offreth you perfit & perpetual obliuion. Furthermore in caſe you be diſpoſed, according to the

deſire of more then half your Bnrgeſie of Antuerpe (as by ſuch aduertiſements as dayly and hourely from all parts we do vnderſtād) to enter communication & parlie, we do promiſe ye that for our parts we wil in ſuch wiſe concurre with you in whatſoeuer honeſtly and reaſonablye you maye propound, that you ſhall effectually perceaue that wee bee rather led by a fatherly affection and vnfayned good will ye we beare to your priuate benefite and tranquilitie, then any other our own intereſt and particuler paſſion, or miſtruſt of the ſucceſſe of oure enterpriſes. Whereas contrariwiſe if you do purpoſe to be obſtinate & ſtubborne, your ſelues will procure ye empayring of all conditions of reconſiliatiō: furthermore proteſting that our ſelues are altogither blameleſſe in the ſhedding of ſo much innocente blood, as alſo of whatſoeuer calamities may hereafter enſue. To the end therefore

that hereafter no man pretende cauſe of ignoraunce of this our good wil togither with ſuche offers as wee make vnto you, we do write our Letters to the ſame effect, vnto the great Counſayle called Den Breeden Raedt, and other the Fraternities: beſeeching the Creator ſo to touch the harts of thoſe that may do moſt among you, that the wealth & quiet which you are hereby to hope for, maye according to our hope, ſhortly enſue. And ſo praiing the Lord to haue you moſt dearely & welbeloued in his holy & worthy protection, we ceaſe. From our Campe at Stabrocck this 13. of Nouemb 1584.

                  MY Lord, your Highnes Letters of the 13, of this Moneth, reſpectiuely writtē vnto the Magiſtrate, ye deanes of Fraternities, & the great Counſaile of this Towne haue bene receaued & read, as well by our College, as by all the members of our towne in the great counſaile of ye ſame expreſly aſſembled to that end: Whervnto of one conſent we haue reſolued for aunſwere to ſhew to your highnes in all reuerence, that the exhortatiō to vs made that we ſhould cōſider of the entent of thoſe that haue bene procurers of this inward warre, wee haue accepted in very good part as proceeding from your highneſſe good affection that you beare to theſe countries, which you do wiſhe to bee reduced to ſome better quietneſſe, as our ſelues

do alſo hartily deſire the ſame, and in conſideration thereof do moſt humbly thanke you. But vnder your correction, it ſeemeth that your highneſſe are not ſufficiently enformed of the true originall and fountaine of this warre▪ for it is manifeſt to all the World that againſt our willes, and to our greate greefe we were forced thereto by the driftes and practiſes of thoſe, who for their owne priuate purpoſes, and to the end to eſtabliſh in theſe countries a dominion in effect more than roial, haue vnder pretence of religion, with their ſiniſter informations procured at ye Kings Maieſties hāds (vnto whom as alſo to all other the high and mighty Princes his predeceſſors, theſe coū
                  tries haue euermore borne as faithful and true obedience, as euer any other nation in the world did beare to their Prince) generally againſt al the inhabitants of the country, of whatſoeuer eſtate, condition, age, or kind, the erection

of the moſt horrible & cruell perſecutions ye were euer herd of or practiſed, togither with infinite confiſcations of goods, proſcriptions, baniſhments, and bloody executions, by fire, ſword and halter, againſt al ſortes of pore, honeſt, and innocēt people, who euen vnhearde in their iuſt & lawfull defence, haue ben without impoſition of any crime condemned, only for gathering together to pray and call vpon one God, through our onely mediatour Jeſus Chriſt, according to his owne word and commaundemente: wherevpon contrary to the treaties, agreements and edictes, ſo firmelye made and publiſhed by the Ladye of Parma, your Highneſſe mother, with the aduow and conſente of the whole counſaile of eſtate, yea euen in ye kings name, vnder his authoritie and ſeale, haue enſued ſuch tirannicall executions by the late Duke of Alua, and the Spaniards, not againſt the pore commons

only, but alſo againſt the principall gouernours, Lords, Barons, & Nobles of ye coūtrie, of whom his maieſtie had receaued moſt notable ſeruice: ye manifeſt infringing of al rights cuſtoms & priuileges, ſworne vnto by al Princes of theſe coūtries: ye ſubuerſion of all ſeats of Juſtice, which haue bene committed vnto ſuch men as by all auncient lawes & priuileges of the countrie, were vtterly vncapable of ye ſame. The raiſing of diuersforts, and vntollerable, vniuſt, & vnlawful exactions, togither with the vtter oppreſſion of all ye liberties of ye whole countrie. Which things being ſo notoriouſly cōmitted againſt al ordinary forme of Juſtice, could not poſſibly bring forth any other fruite then this miſerable war which haue ouerwhelmed vs in this floude of miſchiefes & ſea of calamities. We do therefore beſeeche your highneſſe to beleeue that we neuer entred into this war of any pleaſure

neither by the motion or perſwation of the late Lord the P. of Orange of famous memory, who came not hether, but at the inſtant requeſt of the eſtates, as well of the Prelates, as of the Nobles & towns, neither vſurped any other authority then with greate importunity was layd vpon him. But that of meere extremitie, and ineuitable neceſſitie we were forced and conſtrayned to take Armoure, and to enter into theſe Conflictes, whereof wee deſire nothing in this Worlde, more earneſtly, then ſome good end by a happye peace and generall tranquilitie.
               We doe alſo moſt humblye thanke your Highneſſe for ſuch Parley as at this preſente you doe offer vs the fruition of, and can not ſufficiently commend & extol your magnanimity, who hauing more then any other Gouernor your predeceſſors, made profe of

your vertue and valiauncie in armes, do neuertheleſſe ſo curteouſly offer to accompany the ſame with all gentleneſſe and clemency: a vertue vndoubtedly moſt commendable, euen in the greateſt Princes and Monarks. So that hauing before time ben thus perſwaded of your highneſſe, if we could haue bene certefied that you had ſufficiently ben authoriſed to haue graū
                  ted vnto vs whatſoeuer accerding to your wiſedome & diſcretion, you had knowne neceſſary for the eſtabliſhing of a good and perfite peace, we would neuer haue ſo long delayed the committing of our ſelues into your protection: neyther would we haue ſoughte to enter into any other communication and conditions then youre Highneſſe of your own diſcretion, togither with your clemencie & courteſie. ſhold haue thought reaſonable, as nothing doubting but that willingly ye wold haue followed & moued the King likewiſe

to followe the path of the Noble and commendable examples of other the great kings and princes his Predeceſſors, who in ye like diſeaſe hauing more nearely ſearched out the roote of the miſchiefe, haue found it vnpoſſible to attain to the perfite cure thereof, & to the maintaining of their ſubiectes in a ſtedfaſt peace & firme quietneſſe, accompanied with al faithful dutie & obedience to their ſuperiors, without graunting them libertie of their religion, wherof at al times they offered to giue account to any vnſuſpected or not partial Judges, in all free aſſemblies & lawful ſynodes. For in this reſpect haue they found the eſpecial and moſt ſoueraigne remedie for all theſe miſchiefes to conſiſt in moderate condiſcending vnto the iuſt & lawfull requeſt of their ſubiectes, as appeareth by the examples of the moſte victorious & mightye Emperours of famous memory Charles the v. Ferdinand and

                  Maximilian in Germany, alſo of ye moſt Chriſtian kings in Fraūce, & the kings of Polland, in their dominions. But when as by infinite teſtimonies, & euē by ſundry declarations whiche youre highnes haue made vnto vs, we were certainly aduertiſed yt it lay not in you any way to diſpoſe of yt point, whiche neuertheles is the only ground & principall piller wherevppon this peace or war doth conſiſt, yea & that the King finding himſelf ſubiect to the Spaniſhe Inquiſition, & the Pope of Romes commandemēts, had neither autority nor liberty to graunt to his chriſtian ſubiects the ſame which the Pope & ſundrie Italian Princes doe permit to the Jewes & Turkes, & without ye which it is vtterly vnpoſſible to turne from the people a cōtinual courſe of al ſorts of calamities, we foūd our ſelues paſt al hope of attaining vnto any thing ye might breed our aſſured reſt, the ſame neceſſitie which forced vs to enter into

theſe wars, did alſo conſtrain vs to continue the ſame, thereby to defende our ſelues from ſo vntollerable & wicked oppreſſion, ſo ye after infinite moſt humble ſupplications, petitions, declarations & proteſtations as well by writing as by our deputies ſent into Spaine, beſides the manifold interceſſions & mediations of diuers chriſtian kings & princes in vaine proſecuted for the ſpace of 20 yeares or more, we wer finally compelled to haue our recourſe to forrain Princes: And at this preſent pondering the great & ſinguler wiſdome, equitie & moderation wherby the moſt chriſtian King doth maintain his ſubiects as wel of the one as the other religion in al reſt & tranquilitie, & finding alſo our ſelues in ſuche want & neceſſity, we cannot diſſēble wt your highnes, but muſt needs giue yē to vnderſtand ye al the vnited prouinces which are confederat with vs by a general & vniuerſal reſolution haue

already had recourſe to the moſt chriſtian Maieſtie, & moſt humbly haue beſought him to take our cauſe in hand, & as his ſubiects to receiue vs into his protection, to ye end to defend vs from ſo extreme rigor & crueltie: wherein he hath giuen vs ſo curteous audience & good hope that according to the dutie wherein ſolemnely & generally we all ſtand now bound vnto him, it is no lō
                  ger in vs to enter into any communication or Parlie ye may neuer ſo little bee preiudicial to our offer & promiſe, vnles we wold willingly incur a iuſt reproch of the greateſt vnſtedfaſtnes & ingratitude in the world. Moreouer as we are but one member of the ſayd generalitie, alſo ye by ſolemne oath we haue bound our ſelues not to enter into any parlie or treatie of peace without the general conſent & agrement of al others ye vnited prouinces, we cannot, though we would, accept your highnes offer before we haue obtayned

the conſent and good will as well of them, as of the ſayde moſt Chriſtian Maieſtie. Herevpon doe we therefore moſt humbly deſire your Highneſſe; ye according to this your fatherly curteſie & clemency which ſo freelye you offer vnto vs, it may pleaſe you not to miſlike that before we enter into any Parlie we doe according to our dutie, ſend your highnes letters vnto ye ſayd vnited prouinces, & by their conſent & agrement do likewiſe exhibite thē vnto his ſayd moſt chriſtian Maieſtie, to the end ye ſith it hath pleaſed him to do vs ſo much honor as to hearken to our moſt humble complaints which in other place haue bene reiected, wee doe nothing without his leaue & tolleration, leaſt we ſhould giue him iuſt cauſe to caſt vs of as deceitfull, inconſtant, & vnthankfull perſons. As concerning the proteſtation which it pleaſeth your Highnes to make toward the ende of your letter, we do vndoubtedly beleue

that your ſelf are not the cauſe of ſheding ſo much innocent blood, neither of ſuch miſchiefs as may inſue, for that the originall of this warre proceedeth from an other foundation. But withall wee doe moſt humbly pray you to conſider that for our parts we are not iuſtly to be blamed, as being entered only into defenſiue war, not tending to any other then the maintaining of our ſelues, our wiues & children in life & libertie of conſcience & in the free calling vpon the name of God, through our only Sauiour & mediatour Jeſus Chriſt, & that therefore for our partes we wold willingly ceaſe from al ſhedding of blood, in caſe it might likewiſe pleaſe your highnes in effect to proſecute ye moderation & clemency whiche in letters it pleaſeth you to ſhew vnto vs, by ſtaying the ſame likewiſe on your ſide, to the end ye by the verification of this beginning, we may iudge of the aſſurance of the reſt: farther beſeeching

your highnes to beleeue that we do both admire & loue your vertues, & withall our harts doe deſire to yeelde vnto you moſt humble ſeruice in what ſoeuer our honor, Oath & conſcience, (which we praye that we may reſerue to God only) may any way permit. Herevpon my L. moſt humbly kiſſing your Highnes hands, we beſeech God to ſend vnto you whatſoeuer may be moſt for your health.
