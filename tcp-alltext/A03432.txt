And to a woman, what ſtoare of examples are there to inſtructe her in her dutie, eyther for the maried, to kepe her fayth to her huſband with LVCRETIA, or the vnmaried to defende her virginitye with virginya: fynallye that excellent treaſore and full librarye Lyuye. of all knowledge yeldes vs frelye preſidentes for all caſes that maye happen, bothe for imytacion of the good, Hiſtories a librarie or ſtore houſe of knovvledg deteſtynge the wycked, auoydynge a preſent miſchiefe, and preuentyng any euil afore yt fall: wherein alſo as in euery arte there bée certeine ſpeciall principles and rules for the direction of ſuche as ſearche out their diſpoſition, ſo hiſtories do ſwarme with examples of all kinde of vertues, wherein both the dignitye of vertue, and fowlenes of vice appereth muche more lyuelye then in any morall teachyng, ſeinge therein is figured vnder certeine formes and ſhaps

               o for my part, beyng more forwarde then hable to diſcharge my zeale in that behalfe, haue beſtowed ſome of my voyed howers whileſt I was in the other ſides the Sea, in forcynge certeyne Tragicall Diſcourſes oute of theyr Frenche tearmes, into our Engliſhe phraſe, preſumyng to commende vnto your Ladiſhypp the frutes and effecte of my trauayle, folowynge therein the order of ſuche as haue ſpente tyme in the lyke ſtudye, who are wounte to declare theyr good wyll, by beſtowynge theyr labours: wherewithe beinge vnhappelye denyed other frendſhypp of fortune to make good my deſyer in gyuing an vnfayned ſhowe of the dutye and ſeruice I owe you and the houſe whereof you tooke youre begynnynge, am here vppon tearmes of humilitye for preferment of this rude and ſimple dedication of theis forrein reapportes to youre honor, to whoſe vertues, as I haue chiefelye reſpected to gyue due renowme, by preferrynge a true purtraict of your conuerſation and lyfe in the vertues giftes and ornamentes of the noble ANGELIQVA chaſte PAROLYNA, conſtant IVLIA and renowned CARMOSYNA wyth others, whoſe integretye of life hath gyuen theim a crowne of immortalitye, wyth a glorious remembrance of theyr names for euer after theyr deathe, ſo my ſeconde indeuor was bent to obſerue the neceſſitie of the tyme, chiefly, for that vppon the viewe and examples of oure Aunceſters lyues, the fraile ympes of this age, maye fynde cauſe of ſhame in theyr owne abuſes, wyth deſyer to exchaunge their badd condicion and order of lyuynge, wyth the ſtudye and deſyer to ymitate the vertue of their predeceſſours, whoſe lyfe and renowme after death, argueth the vndoubted rewarde, at tendynge (as a thynge of courſe) the vertuouſe and well diſpoſed, where of the contrarye, appeare wounderfull

tormentes and ſharpp pennaunce prouided to plage the abhominable and vicious lyuer: Beſides it is a principle and chiefe rule in our nature and diſpoſition to bee rather inſtructed by examples of familyar authorityes, then reformed by ſeueritye of lawes, for that the one ſeames to gouerne vs by awe and commaundement, and in the other appeares a conſent of oure fancie, marchinge alwayes accordynge to the direction of our owne willes, for whiche cauſe the Hiſtorians of olde tyme (in theyr ſeuerall recordes of the actes, conqueſtes, and noble attemptes of Princes and greate men) haue lefte oute nothynge ſeruynge for the ornamente and inſtitution of mannes lyfe, not forgettynge to ſett oute alſo in naturall coollers, theyr tyrannye and other vices, withe contempte of vertue, yf theyr lyues were founde guiltye in any ſuche offence: But when they paynte oute a good kynge, a magiſtrate without touche of partiall or couetous mynde, a courtyar loyall and withoute diſſimulation, A miniſter of the Churche not ſmellynge of hypocryſye, but ſearchynge purelye the honor of God, A Ladye chaſte, honeſte, curteouſe, a louer of charitye, vſynge a deuoute reuerence to God and feare to hys lawes, yt is then that they allure (by traines of familyaritye) euerye ſucceſſion to embrace and beholde (as in a glaſſe) the vndoubted meane that is hable and wylt brynge theym to the lyke perfection in vertue, whyche alſo moued me to vſe a ſpeciall diſcrecion in coollynge oute ſuche examples as beſte aggreed wyth the condicion of the tyme, and alſo were of moſte freſhe and famylyar memorye, to the ende that wyth the delyte in readynge my dedication, I maye alſo leaue to all degrees, an appetitt and honeſte deſyere to honor vertue and holde vice in due deteſtation. And albeit at the firſte ſighte theis diſcourſes maye importe certeyne vanytyes or fonde practiſes in loue, yet I doubte not to bée abſolued of ſuche intente

by the iudgement of the indifferent ſorte, ſeinge I haue rather noted diuerſitie of examples in ſondrye younge men and women, approuynge ſufficientlye the inconuenience happenynge by the purſute of lycenceous deſyer, then affected in anye ſorte ſuche vncerteine follyes: For heare maye bée ſéene ſuche patternes of chaſtetye, and maydes ſo aſſured and conſtant in vertue, that they haue not doubted rather to reappoſe a felicitye in the extreme panges of death, then to fall by anye violent force into the daunger of the fleſhelye ennemye to theyr honour: In lyke ſorte appeareth here an experience of wounderfull vertues in men, who albeit hadd power to vſe and commande the thinge they chieflye deſyered, yet (bridlynge wythe maine hande) The humour of theyr inordinate luſte, vanquiſhed all mocions of ſenſualytye, and became maiſters of theym ſelues, by abſtaynynge from that whereunto they felte prouocation by nature: who deſyereth to ſée the follye of a fooliſhe lover paſſionynge hymſelfe vppon creditt, the impudencie of a maide or other woman renouncynge the vowe of her fayth or honor due to virginitie, the ſharpp pennance attendynge the raſhe choice of greate Ladyes in ſéekynge to matche in anye ſorte wythe degrées of inferior condicion: or who wiſheth to bée priuie to th'inconueniences in loue, howe he frieth in the flame of the fyrſte affection, and after groweth not onelye colde of hymſelfe, but is eaſelye conuerted into a contrarye ſhapp and diſpoſition of deadlye hate, maye bée heare aſſiſted wyth more then double expeperience touchinge all thoſe euills: the curteſie of an enemye on the behalfe of hys aduerſarye, wythe a wounderfull lyberalitye in the other in retournynge the benefytt receyued, is heare ſet furthe in fuche lyuelye coollers, that there ſeames to lacke nothynge for the ornament and decoracion of ſuche a wooke. And who takes pleaſure to beholde the fyttes and panges of a frantique man incenſed

to ſyniſter conceites by the ſuggeſtion of frettynge Ielouzye, forcynge hym to effectes of abſolute deſperation, The due plage of diſloyaltye in both kyndes, wyth the glorye of hym who marcheth vnder the enſeigne of a contrarye vertue, a man of the churche of diſſolute lyuyng puniſhed with publike reproche, or the villenie of the greedye vſurer makyng no conſcience to preferr oppen periury in ſuppreſſynge th'innocent cauſe, maye fynde here to ſatiſfye his longynge at full, neyther do I thynke that oure Engliſhe recordes are hable to yelde at this daye, a Romant more delicat and chaſte, treatynge of the veraye theame and effectes of loue, then theis hyſtories, of no leſſe credit then ſufficient authoritie, by reaſon the moſte of theym were within the compaſſe of memorye, wherein as I wiſh the tormentes that pinched here ſuche as labored in a paſſion of follye and fonde deſyer, maye worke a terror to all thoſe that hereafter vnhappelye Syp of the cupp of ſuche ragynge infection, ſo touchinge the commendable partes of anye Ladye or woman of meaner condicion, mencioned in this volume of diſcourſes, I fynde theym farr to lighte to kepe wayghte wyth the ballance, wherein are paiſed the qualityes of your honor, whyche ſeame to haue a certeine affinitye and reſemblance wyth ſuche as were the verye vertuſe and cauſes of commendacion in any that euer deſerued the title of moſte perfect or iuſtyle renowmed: For yf euer the

                  LIke as the ſlender bee, by trauayle in her kynde
               Collects her fruite, the ſugred ſap wherof we dayly fynde.
               So heare my learned frend, in nature lyke the bee:
               Hath linckt his labor to his art, and yeldes the frute to the,
               In tongue eſtraungd from vs, whyles this ſuccedynge worke,
               (As doth the honye in the floure) by couert meane dyd lurke,
               He laborynge with effecte, hath by his learned payne,
               Enforſt a Frenche man tell his tale, in Engliſhe language plaine.
               Not for him ſelf: thou knowest, it aunſwered his delyght,
               By ſkyll to vnderſtande the tale, as dyd the Aucthor write.
               But toylynge for thy ſake, hath fourmd his hyue ful fine,
               Take thou the combe, the payne was his, the honye ſhalbe thyne.
               Good reader yet beware, leaſt Spyder lyke thou take
               By cancred kinde a ſpightfull ſtynge, whence he did honye make.
               Let not in lewe of payne, a tongue compleate with ſpyte,
               Attēpt to harme (though powre ſhal wāt) the thing that he doth writ
               For if thou dost: the wies, will feele thy feſtred kinde,
               And he to whom thou doſt ſuch wronge ſhal ſo thy nature finde.
               No doubt our dayes are ſuche, as euery man can ſee
               And can at eaſe, and wyll perceaue, the ſpider from the Bee.
               Allowe his labour then and worke that well is done:
               And thou ſhalt ſee thee golden race his muſe pretends to roon.
               Let ZOILVS ſuck the teate, that Enuie holdes in hell,
               And ſay with me God ſpede the penne, that hath begone ſo well
               Thus hath he his deſyre, thus ſhalt thou lyue in reſt
               Thus ſhall his frynds haue at thy hands the ſume of their requeſt.

What cauſe haue I then to renew the alaram of their miſerie, or why ſtay I to ſuccour their deſolate ſtate, in ſome ſatiſfaction of the iniuries they haue receiued by me and mine, beſides the wrathe of God accordyng to the wordes of the Apoſtle, is alwaies hanginge ouer the heades of ſuche, as ſeame to take pleaſure in the affliction of their neighbour, reioyce in the miſfortune or miſery of an other, if all thies lacke ſufficient force to mortifie the remembrāce of auncient malice within me, and in expoſing (contrarie to the exſpectatiō and opinion of the world) a wonderful example of vertue, to moue me to releue his diſtreſſe that diſpaireth of all ſuccour, and reclaim by liberalitie the frendeſhipe of him, who if he euer offended is alredye pardoned, like as alſo if his innocency haue bene abuſed by me and mine, my cōſcience calleth me to a remorce, in rendring ſatiſfaction in ſo nedeful a time: yet am I drawen by a band of further dutye, and incenſed by a ſomaunce or ſpecial inſtigacion of the honour and ſeruice, which my harte hath alredye vowed, on the behalfe of her: whoſe beauty & vertue deſerues a greater méede, then the vttermoſt that I can do, eyther for the cōtentement of her, or conſolation of her brother, for like as ther is no man (onleſſe he bee vtterlye deueſted from the gyfte of humanitye) beinge paſſioned with equall affection and ſoſomoned

And if I will make a declaration of the true zeale I beare her, why do I ſtaie to expoſe it in ſo nedefull a time, and on the behalfe of him, whome ſhee loueth no leſſe then her ſelfe, attending euen now the fatall ſtroake of the morderinge ſworde for a tryfflinge due of a thouſande florentes: and why ſhoulde I doubte to make it knowen in publike that only the force of loue hathe made me trybutary to the faire ANGELIQVA, for ſeinge that kinges and the greateſte monarkes of the Worlde do drawe vnder the yoke of his awe, it is not for me to eſchewe that by ſpeciall pryuiledge, whiche is incidente to all men by nature, neyther ought I herein to refuce the offer of my deſtenie, nor ſtraun gers to enter into muche maruaile, if I (beinge of the mettall of other men and ſubiect to no leſſe impreſſion and paſſions of mynde then the reſte) do make preſente dedication of my harte and ſeruice to her whoſe vertue I am ſewer is ſo in vincible agaynſt all aduerſitie, that neyther neceſſitie, nor the moſte extreame meſſage that fortune can ſend her, is hable to make her forfeyte the leaſte pointe of her honeſtie, or forgette the renowme of the genelogie wherof ſhe is diſcended: wherin as honeſt loue hath ſturred vp this mocion in me with compoſicion to expoſe imediatlye the frutes and effecte of ſemblable vertue: So the ſpedye delyuerye of thy brother (Oh: ANGELYQVA) ſhal argue ſufficientlye to all men, that it is only the regarde of thy beawtie that hath paied the price of his raunſom, and remoued frome his tender legges the heauye yrons whiche the penaunce of harde impriſonemente had vniuſtlye enioyned vnto him, tryumphinge alſo with this increaſe of further glorye, that onlye the regardes and glauncis of thy gliſteringe eyes haue made a breach

               tt, then any deſyer of my ſelfe to deale with you in other ſort, then the bond and reſpect of the dutifull zeale I beare you dothe require. Here is to be noted a wonderfull difference in the caſualties accidentall to man, and that the chaunges and alterations in loue be of a contrary diſpoſition to the reſte of the paſſions that trouble the minde: neyther nede we doubt by the authoritie of this example, no leſſe credible then of great admiracion, but loue is a certaine vertue of it ſelfe, ſeinge it workes theffect and expoſeth ſuche frutes as ſeame to reſemble rather the operactōof a deuine miracle, then the ſuggeſtion of our fraile fancye, for howe had this SALYMBYNO redemed ſo frelye and in a tyme of ſuch nede, the carefull CHARLES (beinge firmely confirmed in mortall grud
                  •
               e as you haue harde) if the verye vertue whiche we are not hable to tearme by al proper name in loue had not broken by force of azealous affection, the angrie inclinacion of his nature, and conuerted the humor of his auncient wrath into a compaſſion exceding the imagination of manne. And as it is an ordenarye argument of humanytie to giue ſuccours to ſuche as neyther haue deſerued any thinge of vs and muche leſſe wee neuer knewe nor ſawe, becauſe nature herſelfe dothe ſomon vs all to be thankefull to ſuch as reſemble our ſelues in condition or callinge: So that vertue deſerueth treble comendation, whiche excedinge (as it were thauthoritie of nature) doth force in vs ſuche an inclynacion whiche dothe not only mortefye in our hartes the obſtinat humor noriſhed of long continuance, but makes vs plyable to the thinges which we colde not ſomuch as admitte afore into oure cogitacions and much leſſe performe by any perſwacion of the worlde: wher of you maye note a familiar experience in the diſpoſition of this SALYMBYN who ſuffred himſelfe to be more ouercome wyth the bewtie, vertue and ſeamelye behauior of ANGELIQVA, then with any humilitie or importunatte ſute of her brother althoughe hee hadde layen proſtrate a

thouſande tymes afore his knee. And what hart is tempered with the mettal of ſuch induracion that is not mollified, and made tractable by the regardes of ſo rare a miſterie, as the exquiſite beautye of this SYENNOYSE, or who wil not ſlacke the Raine of his loftie ſtomacke and ſtoupe to the ſomance of ſuche a paragon, humblynge hymſelfe withall euery waye to get the good will of her that gaue place to no creature in the worlde for all perfections of God and nature, neyther is there any reaſon at all to charge hym with imputaciō of foly that indeuoureth to honor and imbrace in his hart, the beautye and other giftes of ſo vertuous a Ladye, nor his trauaile meritorious of other name, then the title of honeſt exerciſe, who addinge an exact diligence to his dutifull zeale and ſeruice in the purſute of her whoſe vertues procure his affection, hath his harte armed onelye with an vpright meanyng of ſincere integritye, and the deſier of his minde tendyng to none other ende then a conſommation of an honeſt and lawfull requeſt: But for the contrary of this honeſt ſocietie, I accompt hym not worthie to haue the ayre breath vpon hym, who practiſinge onely to ſeduce and corrupte the chaſteye of honeſt Dames, hath no reſpect to the vertue of honeſt and true loue, but ſekyng only to ſatiſfy the appetit of his ſenſual luſte, doth embrace the exterior partes of a woman, and commendes ſimplye the tree charged with leaues, without regardyng the frut which makes it worthie of commendacion and fame. Here with it can not be muche frō our purpoſe to enterlarde this digreſſion, with the authoritie of a brief note, whiche I founde written in a frenche booke on the behalfe of the ſinceritye which ought to appeare in women, comparinge the younge Ladye bearynge yet the name of a mayde to the gliſterynge flower in the pleaſaunt ſpringe, vntill by her conſtancie and chaſte behauior, ſubduing vtterlie the wanton mocions of the fleſhe, ſhe expoſe to the worlde the precious fruites deriued of ſo greate a vertue and giue abſolute experience other vndoubted pudicitie: For otherwayes (ſaith he) ſhe

And that this doubte which ſeamed to trouble hym was onely a darke vaile to conceile the trothe and kepe it from her knowledge, or rather his longe impriſonment with diſquiet of minde duringe his trouble, had ſtalled his ſences & made him raue in yt ſorte, wherin ſhe was in equall doubte of them al, til he reſolued her to the contrary, wherewith departing for that night, they repaired to their ſeueral chābers, where ye

He whom you can ſkarcely ymagin (ſaith ye receauour) hath exceded all your frends infirme & faithfull zeale towards you, to whom I haue deliuered the releace of your impriſonment, but not ye acquitaūce of ye money, becauſe here is an ouerplus which I haue here to tēder vnto you, wt your general diſcharge, wherwt

The rare ver tue & curteſie of ANSEAMO SALIMBINO (ſaith he) hath preferred cauſe of perpetual ſhame to al your frendes & allies, and opened you the waye not onelye to be equall, but excede hym in ſemblable merit, wherewith he departed with an infynity of conceiptes and conſtructions of the courteſie of his enemye, and beynge at his houſe in a ſecret gallerye voyde from all companye or occaſion of diſturbance, began to diſcourſe diuerſlye of thaccident, but chiefly what ſhoulde ſturre vp ſuch generoſitie with inexſpectable humanitie in hym, who with his parentes and all the power he mighte make, had bene the onely and mortall ſcourges of his whole houſe, at laſt ſtartyng vp (as it were out of a dead ſleape or newly delyuered from the miſterye of ſom ſodaine qualme) began to remember ſome glées of frendſhy, which he had heretofore noted in SALIMBINO on the behalfe of his ſyſter, which appeared chiefly in the often palewalkes & purmenades he made by the gate of hys Pallais, where yf by chaūce his eyes encoūtred with the viewe of ANGELIQVA, he forgot not to preferre a reuerence and ſalutacion rather of an affectioned hart, then a mynde charged with grudge or any kinde of enymitie, wheruppon he reſolued immediatly that the onelye beautye of his ſyſter did pleade for his lyfe, and purchaſe his deliuerye, concludyng withall in his mind, The noble harte ſooneſt enclined to loue. that as ye noble hart is ſooneſt enclined to loue, ſo when true affection hath once made a breache into the intralles of the valyant and princely minde, it is impoſſible but ſhe ſhoulde expoſe maruelous effectes and fruites of honeſt vertue, like as alſo the ymp deriued of noble kinde, and diſcended of the progenie of renowmed predeceſſours, can not ſo maſke or couer his norriture & education, but the vertue of the minde wil aduaunce herſelfe in the countenance with ſhew of nobilitie in the face, and preferre a facilitie in that, whiche the voice of the worlde hath not onelye iudged impoſſible, but alſo abſolutely perſuaded that he wold neuer be brought

to do it, eyther of frée conſent or force of any awe or allurementes, wherin for his parte becauſe he would neyther be ſurmounted in honeſtie nor noted of anye ſpot of ingratitude determined to reuenge the good tourne he had receiued with ſuche prodigall recompenſe, that he woulde ſeame no leſſe liberall in retorninge thintereſte of the benefit receyued, then the other treble meritorious for thexample of ſoo rare a vertue, wherefore hauinge nothinge worthy to preſent the frendſhipp of SALIMBINO, but himſelfe and his ſiſter, determined to impart his preſent reſolution with the fayre ANGELIQVA, and after diſpoſe themſelues by mutuall aſſent to make a tender & franke offer of that whych was in theym, to be imployed on the behalfe of him and his as he lyſte to ymagine the occaſion, wherin becauſe he was now in the contrey without intent to retourne to the citie till the expiracion of ſome iiij. or v dayes, CHARLES, fynding hys conſcience heauelye charged with a debte on his behalfe, thought to practiſe for hym in his abſence, aſwell as he was myndefull of his late miſfortune, and therupon procured his ſyſter into a gardein far from anye haunte or companye to troble them, where he brake with her in this ſort,
            Amongeſt all the chaunges and conuerſions of mortall affaires Montanyno ſeketh to re quit the good torne of his enemye. (my deare ſyſter) there is none a more familiar precedent of the malice of fortune, then he that is touched wyth diuerſitie of euils, nor anye ſo greate a paterne or example of her mobitie, as they that fynde often chaunge of eſtate, and yet for all that, we ought not to ſuffer any aduerſatie to deminiſhe the vertue and conſtancie of the mind, neyther is it our part to geue ſo greuous a ſentence of the ſtate of mās mortalitie, as eyther to denie mercie to ſuch as be in miſery or diſpair of compaſſion whenne our ſelues be touched with affliction, ſeing that as thinges mortall are full of chaunge, Fortune not to be holden againſt her vvil, and god is bound to no time. and no man hath perpetuall felicitie, So there is no man certaine of any thinge that he hath, and God is bound to no time, and fortune being ſlipperie of her ſelfe, and not hable to be holden againſte her will, dothe neuer giue ſo greate

felicitie, but ſhe enioyneth a double penaunce with trouble of treble annoy in reſpect of the benefyt. And beſides he that falleth frō the vttermoſt ſpray, or height of the higheſt tree, findeth leſſe caſe and more daunger, then ſuche as fele them ſelues taken from the lowe and ſhallow braunches ſupported vpon the firme earth. Al which I prefer vnto you in this place aſwel by a peculyar inſtigacion and remorce of mynde reſtoring a newe remembrance of the noble cōdicion of our Aunceſtors, the auncient glory of our race, and former renowne of the houſe of MONTANYNO, as alſo to ſturre vp in vs both a freſhe ſupplie of ſorowful teares on the behalfe of the late depopulation and vtter ruine of the ſame: wherin for my parts, as often as I beholde the riche ſeates and ſtately buildinges, ſomtime the reſident and ordinarie places of abode of our fathers and grandfathers: when my deſolate eyes glaunſinge vpon diuers corners of this cytie, do fede vpon the viewe of ſondrye ſkutchions and pendels of our armes bearinge a ſpecial marke or badge of thantiquitie of our famuly, or that in the cathedral churches or chiefe temples of this cytie I peruſe the inſcription of ſo manye ſtatelye tombes and perpetuall monumentes of marble, ſhrowdyng the bodies of ſo many noble Knightes and notable Captaines diſcended of the lyne of MONTANYNO: but chieflye as often as I put my foote within the entrey of this pallais (the very reſte and laſt remeinder of them whoſe authoritie onely hath earſt gouerned the ſtate of this commonwelth), I fele my ſelfe ſo paſſioned with inward grefe, and my hart within diſtillinge drops of blodd on the behalfe of ſo great a deſaſter, that I wiſhe more often then I am harde to be taken awaye from the dolourous regarde of ſuche wretched deſolation, to thende that I alon mighte not liue as the od relike or vttermoſt reſte of our ſubuerted houſe. And albeit we may chalēge the firſt place in the beadrol of vnhappy wretches, ſeinge our fortune hath exchaunged oure auncient felicitie, for a preſent lyfe of extreme miſerye, yet yf there be anye cauſe of conſolation in aduerſitie, we haue

raiſon to ioye in the condicion of our ſtate, chefly for that we are not iuſtely to be charged with imputacion of euil or diſhoneſt trade any waie, and that notwithſtanding the raging malice of our fortune with the force of pouertie pinchynge extremely, the diſcourſe of our lyues hath ſo confirmed the generoſitie of our aunceſtors, that we kepe the conſent of al voices, to be nothing inferior to the beſt of them in any reſpect of vertue or ſhowe of true nobilitie: For I haue alwaie indeuored to obſerue this one rule & diſcipline of the re nowmed Emperour & captaine MARCVS ANTHONIVS, who perſuadeth that as the heyght of eſtate ought not to alter Height of eſtate ought not to alter the goodnes of nature. the goodnes of nature: So the frowarde diſpoſition of fortune oughte not to take awaye or diminiſhe the conſtancie of the mynde, with this addicion that he beareth her malice beſt that hydes his myſerye moſte: Beſides thuſmuche dare I aduouche of my ſelfe, that as I was neuer preſented with the offer of any good tourne, whiche I haue not thankefullie requited to thuttermoſte: So I haue not bene a nigarde of anye thinge I haue on the nedefull behalfe of my frende or other companion, deteſtynge alwayes that anye iote of ingratitude ſhold ſtaine the reputatiō wherin I haue lyued hytherunto: For as amongeſt a nomber of vices in men nowe a dayes, the note of vnthanfulnes is no leſſe deteſtable then anye of the reſte: So for my parte I wiſhe the rigour of THATHENYANS lawe vpon hym, who ſeames The Athenians puniſhed vnthākfulnes by death. eyther forgetfull of the benefyt paſſed, or vnthankefull to the frendſhip of hym that brought ſuccours to his neceſſitie when he diſpaired of relief: wherin (my deare ſiſter) albeit you maye happelye imagine the cauſe of this longe circunſtaunce, yet can you giue no certeine iudgement of the ende or concluſion, nor diuine ryghtely the meanynge of the miſterye whiche I purpoſe to reueale vnto you. The threatnynge perill whiche earſte houered to cut in ſonder the fyllet of my lyfe, is of ſo late a tyme, that I am ſewer youre minde hath not yet diſmiſſed the remembraunce of ſo fearefull a tragedye, neyther haue you forgotten I knowe howe

as it were by ſpeciall miracle, I was boughte out of the handes of the executioner of iuſtice and redemed from the rigorus ſentence of the partiall ſenatt, without thaſſiſtance of any my parentes or alyes, by eyther ſimple offer of worde or effect: wherin as I am warned by this experience not onlye to putt ſmall confidence in anye of my kynſmen hereafter, but alſo to reappoſe no aſſurance at all in their flatteringe ſhow of fained face, ſo I haue taſted of ſo great a pleaſure at the handes of hym who neuer deſerued well of mee, nor I cauſe to ymagyne any one droppe of humanitye in hym on my behalfe, that yf I do ryght to his vertue, I haue reaſon to admitt hym not onlye amonge the felowſhippe, but alſo the firſte and chiefe of my deare frendes: for beinge preſſed ſo muche wyth the iniquitte of the tyme, wyth freſhe aſſaltes of newe afflictions, and forſaken with all of my neareſt frendes, I had reaſon to ymagyne, and cauſe to feare that thonly malice of oure mortall enemyes (for the extirpation of the whole ſtocke and roote of oure race) had bene the workers of my laſte trouble and daunger of deathe: But (good ſyſter) in this diſtruſte I haue abuſed the vertue of our late aduerſary deſeruynge to indure pennance for entringe into conceites of conſpiracye agaynſte hym, whoſe late benefyte (excedinge the ymaginacion of all men) hath made me bounde to honor the remembrance of his name with a debte of dutie ſo longe as nature ſhall phan in mee the breathe of lyfe: for in place where I feared moſt daunger, I founde moſte ſauetie, and where I exſpected leaſt ſewertye, I encowntred moſte aſſurance, And that hande whiche I attended only to giue the fatal blowe of my deſtruction, hath not only remoued all occaſions or offers of preſent perill, but become the chiefeſt pillor and proppe of mine honour and lyfe hereafter, wherin becauſe you ſhalbe partaker of the playnneſſe of my tale, aſwell as you haue vſed patience in the hearinge of the circumſtance, yt is ANSEAMO SALYMBYNO the ſon and heir of our aunciente perſecutours, who hath made ſo manyfeſte a declaration of his affected zeale towardes our howſe, that in

taking your brother owte of the handes of thunrighteous ſenate & preſent daunger of perentorye deſtruction, he hath ſeamed ſo lauiſhe of his liberal mynde, that in place of vii. C florentes, he hath paide a thouſande Duckattes for the ranſom of hym, who iudged hym the moſte crewell enemye of the worlde: what argumente of noble harte is this or howe ſeldom dothe a man encounter ſuche rare frutes of vertue? frendes knitt together by a ſpeciall league of amytie or mutuall vowe of frendeſhippe, do oftentymes make the worlde wonder of the ſondry frutes and effectes of conſtancie which appeareth betwene theime: but where the mortall enemie, beinge neyther reconciled nor required nor demaundinge any aſſuraunce for the pleaſure he dothe, paieth not only the debte of his aduerſarye, but reſtoreth his ſtate when hee is at pointe to performe the laſt of his fatal ſomaunce I thinke it excedes all the conſideration of ſuche as vſe to diſcourſe vppon the doinges of menne. I knowe not what title to geue to the acte of SALYMBYNO, nor howe to tearme this his curteſye, yf not that his doinges deſerue a better meede thenne the renowne of DAYMON and PITHIAS or other moſte loyall frendes whome the writters doo fauor wyth ſuche ſurnames of glorye: but as I am a chiefe witnes of hys vertue, ſo the example of hys preſente honeſtie hathe ſturred vppe ſuche an affected humor wythin me that eyther I wyll dye in thindeuor, or els I wylbe equall yf not hable to excede hym in the retourne of hys liberalitie, wherein beinge iuſtelye bownde to engage the beſte parte in me, for the recompenſe of that good torne whiche gaue increaſe to my lyfe, I am to craue a ſpecial aſſiſtance of you (Syſter) for the complotte of the deuiſe whyche I haue alreadye ymagyned and fullye reſolued to performe to thend I maye bee onelye bownde to you for thacquitaunce of the liberalytye of SALIMBINO, by whoſe helxe you that earſte Lamented the loſſe of libertye and lyfe of youre brother maye nowe congratulate hys healthe and happye delyuerye: where wyth the faire ANGELIQVA fully reſolued

Here may be noted thoperacion of two extremities of ſeueral diſpoſitions, natural zeale & fraternal dutie, quarellinge wyth womanly ſhame, & raiſon mentaining cōtencion with in her ſelf. ANGELIQVA knewe & cōfeſſed that her brother dyd no more then he oughte, & that ſhe was alſo leuiable to the ſame bond & obligation of dutie, and on the other part theſtimaciō of her honor with regard to defende her chaſtetie, ſupplāted ſuch dutifull reſpectes of nature, & forced her to an integritie of iudgement, in that which ſhe accompted both vniuſt & vnlawful, wherupon reſoluing to obſerue both the one and the other, & ſeame chiefly to be thankeful to the demande of her brother, determined to diſcharge him of the debte towardes his long enemy & late frend, with intent notwithſtāding rather to die by the ſtroake of her owne handes then villanouſly to loaſe the flower of that which made her lyue famous, & of greater renowme then the moſte part of the ladies of that citie. But the vertue of this SALYMBINO is of more rare ſingularitie & deſerueth a greater cōmendacion, then the continencie of CYRVS ſometime king of PERSIA, who

Albeit the offers of ſeruitude be alwayes moſte hatefull to freemen, and that the noble hart can hardly brooke to ſtrike ſayle for any ſommance of aduerſitie, yet the bonde of a good tourne or benefyt alredy don, leuieth ſuch alarams of remorce to the mynde enuironned with vertue, that ſhe forceth not only an equal cō

And who hath exceded or bene equall in generoſytie or noble corage of harte to ROMVLVS the firſte founder of the prowde Romulus brought vp amonge ſhepherdes. cytie of Rome? yet was hée aſſiſted with no better educacion or trayninge vppe thenne in caues and cabynettes of ſhepherdes, and ſuche as inhabyte the playne and deſerte fieldes for the garde of their cattell: all whyche I haue preferred vnto you (my Lords & Ladyes) as a ſpecial prepratiue to the peculiar praiſe and commendacion of the vndowted noblenes of mynde of SIGNEVR CHARLES MONTANYN and his ſyſter, who wythoute preiudice or wronge to anye, maye well be tearmed the peragon for bewtie and mirroer of honeſte and chaſte behauioure, aboue all the Ladies annd gentlewomen in oure common wealthe, whoſe houſe as you knowe hathe bene ſo oppreſſed wythe contynual perſecucion, that onely they two are the laſte remeyndoures of their whole race, ſtandinge alſo not longe ſince at the pointe of extreme ruyne and vtter ſubuerſion for euer, yet the ympociſion of ſuche ſtraunge miſeryes, colde neyther moue any dymunicion of corage, nor ſtaye of deſyer to expoſe an effecte of that vertue and bowntie whyche nature hathe appointed to occupie the hartes of theym that bée true noble: wherein as I ſée ſome iuſtice to exclaime againſte the crueltie of our aunceſtors, for that the only reſpecte of a ſmal broyle happeninge by chaunce, hathe moued them to thonder a moſt mortal vengance of this ſo auncient and vertuous a ſtocke: So for my part, being pryuie to mine Of vnlavvfull vvinning of the father cō

But nowe becauſe I ſée you alredie ſorowearyed with the lengthe of a lingrynge ſuſpence deſyerynge to knowe the cauſe of thys greate commendaciou of the MONTANYNS, with requeſt to abridge my tediouſe diſcourſe, if you will lende me yet a litle liberty to ſpeake, with patience to heare the chiefe poyntes of my proteſtation, the ſpedie ende of my tale ſhal reſtore preſent quiet and contentment to your trobled myndes. It is longe ſince I muſte confeſſe (and yet thoffence is neyther mortal, nor falte ſo hainous but it may be forgiuen) that the beauty with other parts of perfection in the faire Angeliqua here preſente, ſo rauiſhed my ſences and robbed me of my libertie at one inſtant, that thonly exerciſe whych occupyed my head daye and nighte for a longe tyme, was the ſondrye deuiſes I ymagyned to diſcouer vnto her my martiredome, wherin I fedd the hongry humor of my affection, with ſuch alarams and contraryetie of conceites, that hauinge by thys meane loſte the neceſſary appetite of the ſtomake, and vſual deſyer of ſleepe, I felte ſuche a diminucion of nature and

lyuelye force thorowe all the partes in me, that I was preſented at one tyme wyth the choice of two moſte perillous euils in the worlde, the one to dye afore my tyme by ſuffocacion of pynnynge dollour, or els to yelde to a depriuation of my ſences and gyfte of vnderſtandinge for euer: wherein I was alſo purſued wyth the readye aſſiſtaunce of perplexed diſpaire, for that I ſaw no meane to make that ſeame eaſye wherein I iudged ſo greate an impoſſibilitye, chieflye by the grounded quarels of oure ij. houſes, whereby albeit the warre ſeames ended, and the grudge halfe appaiſed betwene vs, yet was I of opinyon, that there remeined an equall deſyer in the hartes of vs both, neyther to wiſhe well the one to the other and muche leſſe to abſteine from further ſlaughter, when ſo euer a newe occaſion ſhoulde efteſones fall oute, neyther coulde theis mortall impedimentes argue ſufficient raiſon to diminiſh min affection, but ſturred vp rather a treble increaſe of deſyer, accordynge to the paſſioned minde enchaunted with loue, who makes ſuche as he poſſeſſeth more apte to deſyre, then Loue make vs more apte to deſier, then hable to attaine. hable to attayne to the effect of that whiche they wiſhe, preferrynge alwayes a ſimple likelihode in that wherin appereth an abſolute impoſſibilitye, to thende to afflicte theyr miſerable lyues wyth continuall annoye: but as theis extremeties had filled my head full of diſpaire and committed me to a continuall carefulnes of minde, becauſe I coulde neither ſtaye the courſe of my affection, nor encounter the obiect of my deſyer, beholde fortune entred into compaſſion of my ſtate, aſſiſtynge me wyth ſo readye a medecine for my greate diſeaſe, that when I was voyde of all expectation or hope of recouerye, I was preſented with a franke offer of my deſyered praye, for as it is not vnknowen to you all that ſence the departure of viij. or ten dayes, the Lord MONTANYN here preſent, beinge accuſed afore the SENATE vppon certeine peinall ſtatutes, deuiſed by our cruell ſtate for the rappeale of baniſhed men, was awarded by iudiciall ſentence to paye the forfaiture, whiche becauſe he coulde ont

nottender within the tyme, his greadie enemies forced ye law to a more rigour then was neceſſarie, in ſuche ſort as thexecutioner was readie to extende vpon his bodie for want of a ſupplye of a thoſande florents, to choake the couetous humour of the magiſtrates. Euen ſo the view of his extremitie ſturred vp ſuch a remorce in my mynde that me thought I was ſommoned by dutie to preuent the deſtruction of him, who was brother and thonly comfort of her whom I had alredye proclaimed the ſoueraigne Ladye and myſtres of my hart, in whiche good vaine of deuocion I payd the money and procured his delyuerye, who (for his parte) deuinynge I can not tell vpon what occaſion, that the beautie of his ſiſter did worke theffect of ſuche a vertue in me, hath not onely been thankefull for the benefit, but alſo ouercome me in honeſte liberalitie and true noblenes of mynde, preſenting me in the beginnynge of this eueninge at myne owne howſe with a prodigal offer not onely of hymſelf and al yt he hath, but alſo of his ſyſter whom he lefte with me to vſe and diſpoſe at my pleaſure: wherein for ende I appeale to you all with one requeſte that in waighinge rightly the gyfte of the one and offer of the other, you will conſider of them both, and aſſiſte me immediatly wyth your aduiſe in what ſorte I maye yelde a due meede to ſuche ij. precious merites, the one a moſt familiar patterne and precedent of true nobilitie, and the other a preſent of ſuche price and value, that the greateſt prince in ITALY coulde do no wronge to his greatnes in yeldynge honor and homage to ſo rare a thing: wherupon he ſtayed his further diſcourſe, gyuinge place to thaſſiſtantes for conſultacion of the caſe, whiche albeit they knewe imported deliberat aduiſe afore the reſolution of iudgement, yet were they in amaze what ſentence to gyue, becauſe they were neither priuie nor partakers of the determinacion of hym who had ſommoned their apparance there, rather to witnes the fact then deuide the caſe, or impeſhe his reſolute intent by a contrarye councell. The Ladies his kynſwomen were ſo moued to admiracion wyth the

maieſtie and other argumentes of vertue in the faire ANGELIQVA that they had paſſed iudgement on her ſyde yf they had not feared to be refuſed of hym, who wiſhed their voice that waye, and who onely beinge touched aboue the the reſt moſt neare the quicke, diſmiſſed their aſtoniſhment in reueilyng his owne determination in this ſorte. Seinge you take ſo greate a tyme to diſcuſſe ſo ſmall a matter with no leſſe doubte to publiſhe ſentence of that whiche is alredye determined let me abridge all arguments of further delaye in decipheryng in playne wordes the thynge whiche hetherunto I haue communicated but by circunſtance, ou ſhall vnderſtande ſayth he (in takinge ANGELIQVA by the hande, that hauynge the regarde of honor afore myne eyes, with deſyer to recompenſe at full the honeſtye and vertue of the brother. I am reſolued to take the ſyſter to my deare and lawfull wyfe, preferrynge by that meanes a perfect vnitye of that whiche longe tyme hath lyued in ſeparacion, and make of twoo bodyes earſte and longe diſioyned, an equall wyll and entyer mynde, deſyerynge all your conſentes in the conſommation of this alliance, whiche ſeameth rather the worke of God, then an effect of the councell or diligence of man: for the lawe of mariage Mariage the firſt thing vvherin chriſt glorified himſelf by miracle. beynge an inſtitution of the higheſt, and the thinge wherin Chriſt firſt glorified himſelf by miracle vpon earth is recorded in thinfallible booke of his foreknowledge, to thende nothynge chaunce whiche is not permitted and forſeene by the prouidence of the God of marueils, who ſewerlye layed his hande vpon the (brother MONTANYN) in touching the with diſtreſſe and perill of lyfe to thende that my ANGELIQVA, being the onely meane of thy delyuerye might alſo laye an immouable fondacion of a mutuall vnitie betwene our two houſes, which I hope ſhall furuiue the length of tyme and not ende but wyth the laſte remeinder of eyther of our poſterityes. This concluſion thus hearde of the parentes, and kynſfolkes of SALYMBYNO, and canuaiſed alitle in their ſeuerall opinions, ſeamed at laſte of ſuche reaſon

and indifferencie to them all, that they conuerted their conceites whiche kepte them occupyed for a tyme into a preſent diſpoſition of wonderfull ioye and gladnes feelynge in theyr intrals and inwarde partes (I can not tell by what ſecret inſtinct of minde) an approche of indiſſoluble tranquillitie on all partes, by the only coniunction of this newe allyance. And albeit there was no equalitye of porciō, & that ye dowere of ANGELIQVA ſtoode aloff from the reuenues of her newe conſort, yet the vertue and giftes of grace appearyng in her, made her ſeame hable to counteruaile hym in any reſpect, & his frendes with one voice gaue generall commendacion to the goodnes of his fortune for plātyng his affection in ſo vertuous a ſoyle, wherein ſewerly they had good reaſon, for mariage being a law and holye Sacrament giuen vs from God as thonly knott of mutuall tranquillitie betwene man and In the choice of our vvife vvee ought to reſpect the vertue and gyftes of the mind and not the riches or exterior beautye. woman oughte to be embraſed for the vertue and ſinceritie of the thynge and not abuſed with a regarde of richeſſe or other fylthye promocious of the worlde. And he that in the choice of his wyfe reſpectes chieflye her beautie and greatnes of porcion, (beſides a thouſand pettie mutynies that fall out in houſekeping,) eſcapeth ſeldom without a ſprit of grudge or cyuill diſcenſion, diſturbynge hys quiet wyth a continuall humour of frettynge diſpoſition féedynge hys mynde, for the glaſſe of beautie retireth and gyueth place to age, whiche alſo mortifyeth the delite or deſyer of further pleaſure, and on thother ſyde the woman knowynge her diſcent more noble, and porcion to excede the welthe of her huſbande forgetteth not to take hart at graſſe, and deckynge her garlande wyth all ſortes of flowers of pryde and diſdayne, ſéekes to gouerne and gett the vpper hande of hym, who as he is appointed her heade by the woordes of the ſcripture and inſtitution of nature: So he oughte to kepe a ſtraite hande of the ſame bridle and Raine of authoritie, vſinge it as a chek to reſtraine the deſyer of libertie in her, that ſtudieth to haue hym in ſubiection, wherein

I wiſhe all bachilors and younge men vnmaried to be armed againſte ſo greate a miſchiefe with the experience of ſuche theyr frendes as they ſee touched with the like griefe. And for my part I lament the diſquiet of them, as woulde and can not, or rather dare not attempte a ſimple reformacion in them who are borne to beare the yoke of awe and commandement of their huſbandes, retournynge therewyth to the ſequeile of SALYMBYNO, who workynge the laſte effect and conſommation of his curteſye, gaue the one halfe of his goodes of all ſortes in fauour of the mariage, adopting at thinſtant the MONTANYN as his brother in lawe and aſſured frende, with generall ſubſtitution to all his goodes, if he chaunced to dye without heire of his bodye, and hauyng children he conueighed vnto hym by ſuche aſſuraunce in reuercion as the lawe coulde deuiſe, that moytie, whiche he gaue in dowerye to his faire ANGELIQVA, whome the Sonday folowynge he maried with pompe due to both their eſtates, to the vniuerſall contentement of his frendes, and ſpeciall quiet of the Citye, who had endured longe affliction by the mortalitie and ciuill warre of theis ij. houſes: Suche be the varieties happenyng in the ſucceſſe of our wordly affaires, wherein who wil denye but that aduerſitie ſomtime is neceſſarie for men, ſeinge ſhe doth not only force a wonderfull remorce and reformacion of lyfe, but Aduerſitie is neceſſary for that it makes vs parfect. alſo workes often tymes an effect of that wherin appeared an abſolute impoſſibilitie of conqueſt by any other meane.
            And truly the vertue of this example diſcredites vtterly the commendacion of the auncient ROMAINES, amongeſte whome as there chaunced diuerſe tymes greate enimyties and grudge of mynde, ſo there folowed a ſpedie reconcilement (albeit not by ſuche meanes as this franke attonement betwene the SALYMBYNS and MONTANYNS, but ſome were reclaymed by the offer of promocion, ſome ſolicited by the voice of the whole common welth and confirmed by the preſent gyfte of ſome notable office, and other with a regard

to peculyar proffit, not one of them all approchynge neare the magnanimitie in the worſte of theſe three, whereof the one ſommoned by a paſſion of loue ſcamed to excede nature in perfourmynge an exploit not hable anye waye els to be wrought to effect: And yet there be that cryenge out againſte loue paintes hym in cullors of rage, follye and frenzye, but ſuche are rather abuſed wyth theyr owne conceites, then hable to conſider ryghtelye the vertue of that impreſſion: for loue in the noble harte is no other thing then the true ſubiecte of curteſye, the fountaine from whence diſtilleth the originall of all cyuill and good order, The vertues in loue in a noble minde. the onelye meane, that moues vs to moderacion when we are inclined to crueltie or reuenge, and the chiefeſt norſſe and preſeruer of peace amongeſt men, wherein yf ſome vile diſpoſition happen to violat or peruert the lawes of ſo neceſſarie and auncient inſtitution of nature, the vertue and ſubiect it ſelfe yet oughte not bee touched wyth the cauſe of ſuche faulte nor deſerue to be noted of any corruption, ſeinge ſuche derogation procedes by the abuſe of hym that knoweth not the perfection of the thynge, which falles out alſo in experience in diuerſe other accidentes, who beinge vertues of them ſelues, do loaſe theyr credit, by the malice of ſuche as abuſe them vyllanouſlye, whervpon the good thynge is often condemned by the folly of ſuche as are ignoraunt in the perfection of the ſame, in the other appeares a rare diſpoſition of a bountifull mind, ſo farre from the abhominable ſpot of ingratitude, that his lyfe was ready to bee offred for the ſatiſfaction and diſcharge of the curteſie if the other had required it, wherein as you maye ſee greate effectes of true magnanymitye, and wherein a noble mynde oughte not to bee ouercome with the vertue of honeſte curteſye, ſo touchynge the price of the victorye, I meane whiche of the three is moſte meritorious of commendacion, and deſerueth to weare the garland, I referre the iudgement to thindifferencie

of ſuche as wythout paſſion or parcialitye doe vſe to note the chaunces happenynge to men, you ſee a mortall enemye ſorowed for the miſerie of his aduerſarie, but ſolycited thereunto (you will ſaye) by the ineuitable force of loue, whiche alſo wroughte his delyuerye: the other marched wyth the glorye of a preſent ſo rare, that the greateſt Monarcke of the worlde maye be aſtonyed with the remembraunce of his prodigall bountie. The wonderfull zeale and affection of the ſyſter towardes her brother chalengeth no leſſe praiſe then the reſte, who albeyt ſhe had ſéene a proof of the curteſye of her enemye, yet had ſhe no aſſurance of his modeſtie, notwythſtandynge to diſcharge euerye waye her dutye towardes her brother ſhe layde her virginitye vppon the blocke of vyolacion: the fyrſte claymeth to bee victor, becauſe his laſte vertue in the mariage excedes his former curteſie, but he hath ouerthrowen his enemie and not won the feelde, ſo that he is not to enioye the prayſe or price of the victorye.

               The argument.
               
                  THere is nothinge how good and profytable ſo euer it appeare, whereon attendethe not a diſcommodytie to hym that deales in it wythout diſcrecion, together with a perentorye diſpleaſure in receiuing it contrarye to the conſent of good gouernemēt wherin I may be aſſiſted with ſufficient confirmation in a daylye experience of the ordynarye meates, brothes, and other confeccions tollerated by phizicke for the ſuſtentacion of man, whiche albeit bee good of theim ſelues, yet being ſwallowed in glottonous ſort, they do not only procure a ſurfeyt with vnſauery indiſgeſtion, but alſo conuerting our aunciente healthe and force of nature into humors of debylytie deſtillinge thorowe all the partes of the bodye, do corrupte the blodde which of it ſelfe afore was pure and without infection: Euen ſuche is the diſpoſition of loue, whoſe effectes, directed by reaſon (whiche oughte to guide euerie accion and doing of man) be not ſuche enemies in deede to the quiet of our lyfe, as neceſſary meanes to reforme the rudenes of our owne nature, accordinge to the authorytie of the poet affirminge that by loue the rudeman is reduced to a cyuilitie, the foole learneth wiſedom, the cowarde becomes valiaunte, and the couetouſe nigard Sondry vertues in loue. ſettes his purſe wyde open to hys frende: neyther is there any kinde of curteſye wherwith hee that is in loue doth not participat: but who makes an experience of the contrarye, I meane without aduiſe or iudgemente will throwe himſelfe hedlonge into the golphe of a foliſhe and ronning phantaſye, eſcapes hardly without the rewarde

whiche that frantike paſſion yeldeth ordenarely to ſuche as are vnhappelye partakers of ſuche infection, neyther is there any thinge more furthereth the ruyne and dekaie of man then ſuffriuge the eyes of our vnderſtandinge to be ſeeled with ſuche ymitate to ymate that as a glott of our gredy deſyers, whiche nature hathe enioyned to all eſtates to honour and embrace as a ſpeciall vertue. And trulye me thinkes that, that foliſhe and infortunat crewe mighte reſerue therrours and deſtructions of others as ſpeciall pattornes and preceptes to reſtraine the humor of their owne madnes, by the whiche (or they be aware) they are ledd to the brinke of mortall deſtruction: albeit thindiſcretion of that miſerable ſorte ſeames nothinge vnlike in comparaiſon to thoſe that hauinge longe vſed the trade of thefte and robberye, and ſeinge their companions paſſe by the ſentence of a corde, lacke grace notwithſtandinge to diſclaime the wickednes wherin they haue bene nozeled ſo many yeares, neyther is their plage (or rather iuſte puniſhmente) any thinge inferior, for they makinge a chiefe glorye of that whiche is moſte imperfecte in loue, are eyther ſo ſubiecte to diſpaire, or beaſtely aſſotted withe the greedye encownter of the pleaſure they fynde, that procuring by theyr owne folly and want of order the proceſſe of their fatall ſommaunce in the entrey to their felycitye, are forced to reſigne at one inſtante their lyfe and loathinge contentmente of leſſe contynuance then the paines in loue ſeame greuous to the mynde that hath ye gift to paſſe theim ouer by reaſon. And like as a vehement and inwarde greffe of the mynd (proceding by the malice of a ſyniſter fortune,) is of ſuch force, to cloſe the poares and couduictes of the vitall partes of man, that cancellinge the commiſſion of lyfe, the ſoule departes leauinge

in the euſll whiche I ſuffer, ſo that you will performe the effecte of your promiſſe, whiche you maye the rather accompliſhe by the credit you haue with her who is the onely cauſe of my tormente, whereof after ſhe had giuen hym a ſeconde aſſuraunce by othe and proteſtation of faythe, he tolde her (not withoute a freſhe ſupplie of ſorowe) that it was CAMILLA to whom his libertie was captile, and in the ballance of whoſe compaſſion wayghed indifferently, the lycence of longer life, or ſentence diffinitiue of preſente death, deſierynge her for ende to make her priuie to the paine he indured, and with all to procure ſpedie moderacion of his gréefe, or els to awarde the writte of fatall ſomonce to hym that is not hable to féede the vaine of lyfe without the foode of her ſpeciall fauour: The gyrle delityng ſtill in the amarous diſcourſe of her brother, willed hym to take harte at graſſe and makynge exchaunge of his ſolytarle order to a wake out of his dreame of dompes and reuoke his diſpoſition of auncient cherefulnes, leaſte his miſtres loathing his thyn and weariſhe lookes be affraide to graunt loue to a Stoane or ſuffer her ſelfe to be embraſed by one, in who me is neither preſent delite nor likelihod of future pleaſur. Ah ſiſter ſaith hee how your libertie of tounge argueth your ſmall experience in caſes of loue, whoſe delites conſiſte in teares, ſighes, and dolorous complaintes, wherein as ſuche as be moſte conſtante of all, make declaration alſo of effecte of ſuche loyaltie in takinge pleaſure to recorde their ſorowe, with tunes of lamentable note, ſo in expoſinge the contrarie, we diſcouer at vnwares the ſlender affection we beare to the thynge we deſier, and for my parte I fele no leſſe pleaſure by ymagination, when I ſee with the eyes of my mynde the beautie and other perfections of my deare CAMILLA, then you whiche neuer taſted of the apprehenſion of this frée conſtrainte whiche the deſtenie of loue hath appointed to attend vpon me: I am glad ſaith ſhe to be warned in this ſorte to eſchewe the lyke

Here was a double offence in LIVIO both to force his ſyſter to an enterpriſe indecent for her honor and age, and alſo to prefer her to be the DARIOLETTA of his loue, opening (as it were) the way of voluptuous pleaſure to al youth yt which is to much enclined that way by the corruptiō of our own nature, without that we nede thaſſiſtāce of art to ſupplie our defaultes in ſo vnhoneſt an ercerciſe, albeit our blindnes is ſo great in things of ſuch foly, that (in reſpectinge only ye preſent) we neuer feare ye fal of future incōuenience, til being ſerued with ye writ of preſent penāce It is neceſſary to knowe the imperſectious of the worlde. we fynde to lytle leaſure to repente ſo greate offences, and albeit (accordyng to Ariſtotle) it is neceſſarie to be priuie to thimperfeuions in the world and to knowe ſom tyme wherin we offerde, yet giues he this councell with al that, we

conuerte the experience of ſuche ſyniſter encounters, to a peculiar defenſe of our ſelues againſte thaſſaultes of ſemblable accidentes, and not to vſe it as an authoritie or priuiledge to iuſtifie our wickednes or conſume oure tyme in the ymitation of euill, wherein as the good men are defended by their vertue, ſo let the worſer ſorte be ware by ſo manye millions of examples as our vnhappie age at this preſent is hable to furniſhe in the like affaires. And ſo to our hiſtorie, the morow after this diſcourſe betwen the dolorous LYVIO and his ſyſter, it chaunced that the doughter of RENALDO came all alone to ſee her companyon CORNELIA, who albeit was ſufficiently mindefull of her promiſſe, yet was ſhe furthered with a fit occaſion by CAMYLLA, for that after certaine litle deuiſes betwene them ſhe aſked the cauſe of the ſodaine chaunge and alteracion in her brother, & why he was no more ſéene to aſſiſte the honeſte aſſemblies in maſque or other ſorte, to whome CORNELIA aunſwered, that as ſhe was of equall deſyer to knowe thoccaſion of his ſolitarie abſence, ſo greuynge aboue the reſte with his pyning eſtate, I haue aſked (ſaith ſhe) the cauſe of his gréefe: which with the circunſtance and effecte of all his annoye procedes from you (my deare frend and companyon,) as one in whome is noriſhed the care and trauaile of mynde of my ſorowfull brother. Howe is it poſſible ſaith the ſimple CAMILLA that I ſhould worke hym any wo, ſeinge hitherunto I haue bene no leſſe careful of his wel doing, then curious of mine owne health, neither haue I ſaide or don the thing (I am ſewer) wherein was any pointe of euil meanynge towardes hym, onleſſe he make conſtruction of my ſimple and honeſte zeale, lyke as alſo I would be ſorie to be the author of his miſcontentemēt any waye: the preſent paſſion of my brother ſaith CORNELIA is deriued of a contrarie cauſe, for the to much delite and pleaſure he hathe taken in ſeinge you, hathe broughte hym to the brinke of this bane, and yet as they wryte of the SCORPION hee hopeth to drawe the remedye frome her that hath geuen him the wounde. Yf you make not a more

plaine expoſition of youre darke texte, ſayeth CAMILLA I ſhall hardlye reade the miſterye of your readle, for as yet I vnderſtande nothinge but highe duche: eye marye ſayeth thother and therein conſiſteth the chiefeſte cauſe of my greefe, for if the peculyar affliction of my brother were comon alſo to you, or that you enioyed but a ſimple perticipacion of his annoye, you ſhoulde not onlye vnderſtande that which I am driuen to vnfolde, but be as readie to geue the remedie, as hee hathe reaſon in the meane while to ſuffer the grefe, or I aſhamed to be the meſſenger. Do away this philoſophie my dearefrende (ſaythe CAMILLA and cutte of at laſte my doubtfull ſuſpence touchinge your meanynge, for if thuttermoſte of that whiche is in me maye ſtande hym in ſteade, I will eyther performe the full of your demaunde, or at leaſt yelde you ſuch reaſon to the contrarye, that you ſhalbe voyde of iuſt cauſe to complaine of myne aunſwere.

And ſeynge the ſentence is alredye paſte, and confirmed by the voice of my deſtymes, why do I conceile my paſſion in the myddeſt of a thouſande flames whiche tormentes me within, or why do I diſſemble that, I deſire moſte, or retire myne eyes from the view wherein they chieflye delite? why do my feete ſtaye to tranſporte thys body to the place, where the harte hath already taken poſſeſſion, wherwith ſhe determyned the ſpedye conſolation of LYVIO, wyth no other drogue or confection, then a free conſente of her loue, yf the ſame were efteſoones demaunded, and there vppon collored her goynge to hys logynge to ſee CORNELIA, whome as ſhee founde in her bedde wythe more argumentes of deathe then apparance of lyfe, by reaſon of a generalle weakenes whyche hadde mortyfyed the whole ſtrengthe of her body, ſo ſhe hadde not ſpent in any wordes in the conſolation of her companion, but LIVIO (ſmellynge as it were) the preſence of hys ladye aſked hys ſyſter who was wyth her, who aunſwered that onely CAMYLLA kepte

Yf there be any hope in extremetye, or expectacion of helpe in mortall diſtreſſe, it is tyme nowe (good Liuio at the poīt of death ſpeaketh to his miſters. madam) to conuerte your Auncient crueltie into an humour of compaſſion: both to defende your ſelf from thymputacion of a tyrant, and my lyfe from a wretched ende of miſerable diſpair: ceaſſe henſfurthe to diſſymule thuttermoſt of your rigour, or drop of preſent grace, ſeinge that both the one and the other hath indiffrent power to releue my diſtreſſe eyther by death in denieng me your fauour, or contynuance of longer lyfe by impartyng your ſpecialle grace: come cruell miſters and ſee thy vnfortunate LIVIO without hart, hope, or argument of longer breathe, yf by a promiſſe of thy good will, thou breathe not an ayre of freſhe conſolacion and by the ſommaunce of thy worde reuoke my dyeng mynde from thys tombe of myſerable diſpaire where in I feele my ſelf ſo tormented with thofficers of deathe, that nature ceaſſyng to ſupplie my weary partes with force, I fynd an impoſſibilitie in my tonge to obey any longer the deſyers of my hart, wherewith his breath began to drawe ſhort ſtaying the courſe of further ſpeche, yf not that in entryng into hys fatall traunce he expoſed certeine dolefull groanes, whyche cauſed bothe the younge Ladies to Ronne in haſte to the ſuccour of the patient, whome they founde ſtryuinge with thextremetie of hys laſte pange, albeit not without ſome litle perye of breathe, whyche he ſeamed to reſerue wyth greate difficultie, whereuppon CAMYLLA ſeynge a prouffe of his conſtancie euen to the laſte moment, and hauynge but one meane to releue hys traunce, made no conſcience to lett fall her roſye and courrall lyppes vppon the mortifyed mouthe of her diynge LIVIO who receyued ſuche preſent conſolaciō by thys offer of fauour vnloked for, that ye force of nature and vitall ſtrengthe ready to depart out of euery vayne of

both to delyuer my ſelfe out of payne in ſeinge you paſſioned, and alſo to qualifye the greffe of my deare companion your ſyſter, to whom you are alſo bounde in ſome ſorte to be thankeful for my commynge hether: For albeit my conſcience ſommoned me to a compaſſion of your torment with deſier to yelde you the due hyer and conſideraciō of the honeſt loue you beare me, yet ye regarde of mine honour deniynge me to viſite you, ſeamed an impediment to theffect of that, wherunto I was bounde by ſo many duetifull merites, prayinge you for ende to excuſe that whiche is paſt, and pardon me for the preſent, in that I can not aſſiſte you with longer companye, perſuadyng thy ſelfe (my deare LYVIO) that althoughe my bodye muſte ſupplye an other place to coullour the trafficque of our loue, and preuent ſuſpicion, yet thou haſts made ſuche a ſtealth of my hart that the ſame will not fayle to kepe the companye in my abſence: wherewith takynge her leaue with a chaſte kyſſe, of her ſeruant, and frendlye farewel to CORNELIA, ſhe retireth to her fathers Palais leauynge her louer well lightned of all his cares, ſauyng of a neceſſarye meane to ſounde the good will of the olde REINALDO wherin notwithſtandynge he vſed ſuche expedicion of diligence, that afore hymſelfe could enioye the benefyt of perfect health, he procured certaine auncient Gētlemen his neare parents to performe his reqneſte to thold niā, whom they ſolicited with ſuche inſtance & in ſorte of mariage, that he admitted theyr offer, and confirmed the bargaine with theis wordes, that onely LIVIO ſhoulde be the firſte that ſhould renounce the bale, albeit ſaith he becauſe of thinfirmitie of mine age, I vſe the cōſent of my ſon in all my affaires of importance, ſo I craue onely your patience in the fynall concluſion of the mariage til his retourne frō Rome, at which time only your ſelues ſhal name the day of conſommation: in this aunſwere albeit appeared an impediment to the performance of the mariage, for that (as you haue harde) CLAVDIO enuyed the ſtate of LIVIO, which argued a difficultie in him to approue

ſhallyance, yet CAMILLA vnderſtanding the reſolution of both their parentes, gaue as ſewer iudgemente of the mariage, as if it had bene alredie publiſhed in the churche, and therupon began to enlarge her familiar hawnte and repairs to LIVIO whom if ſhe embraſed afore with earneſte zeale, it was nothinge in reſpectt of the vehemencie of her preſent affection, which alſo deuyded hymſelfe into ſuch a SYMPATHIA and equalitie of loue in theim bothe, that it ſpredde abrode by indiffrent braunches in bothe their hartes, like as the morninge ſon in the eaſte giueth by litle and lytle contynuall encreaſe to his beames comforting the creatures vppon earth. And in this often enterviewe together, LYVIO, enioyenge nowe his auncient health and dexterytie of body, being one daye (amongeſt the reſt) with his lady in the cham ber of his ſyſter toke his lute and ſonge a ditie whiche hee had made of their reciprocall paſſion, wyth ſuche contentemente to hys CAMILLA, that ſhe deſired hym efteſones to repaite it in ſemblable note, aſwel for the delyte of the tune, which he performed with a voice to her contentacion, as alſo the ſubtill ſtile and fyne conueighe of the matter, arguinge a conclucion of that which they bothe wiſhed wyth equall appitit, ſeinge that as their continuall haunt and frequentacion together, gaue increaſe to their deſyer, ſo they were both of opynion, that loue colde not beare the title of perfecte affection, if theffect of that whych was indiffrently wiſhed of theim both, did not make perfect the thyng which hithervnto was debated but by wordes, other wayes that whiche was paſſed betwene theim, beinge but a naked loue whithout effecte, other then certeine delicate kyſſes whyche ſerued rather to kyndle the coales of deſyer, then quenche the flame alredye burning within their intralls ſeamed but a ſimple platte or playne table, whiche the conninge painter hath ſmothed for the nonſt to drawe ſome ymage of exquiſytt ſkille, wherein being ouercharged with intolleracion of deſyer, and fynding thabode of CLAVDIO longer thenne they ymagined, they paſſed vnhappely a pryuye contracte

betwene ſhem ſelues, with erſpectaciō to conſomat the ful of ye matter with a due hyer of ye paines they indured indiffrently in attendinge, an effecte of their pleaſure at the retorne of CLAVDIO from Rome. But here fortune began to preſente her ſelfe vppon the ſtage, as one that wilbe knowen to beare a ſwaighe in the good happe or infelicitie of man, and vs of ſuche vnconſtante and malicious regard towardes vs, that when we thinke we bee paſte the feare of all perill, and trodden all deſaſters vnder our féete, it is then that we fynd leaſt aſſurance in the thinges wherein we reappoſed our chiefeſt pleaſure, and in the turninge of her weale is figured the alte racion of oure wordlie affaires. I meane by a conuerſion of thinges which earſte ſeamed pleaſant and delicat, into a taſte ercedinge the bitternes of gal, in ſuch ſorte, that often tymes wée fynde deathe of more eaſye burden then wée are hable to beare the panges whiche ordenarilye attende the flatteries of this vncerteine FORTVNE, whom the Poetes and painters (not wythout cauſe haue drawen in ye picture of a blynd woman ſtanding vppon a tickle ſtaie of an vnconſtant globe or bowle repreſentinge thereby her fragilitie, and how blind lye ſhe guides the thinges of ye world, what authorities colde & inferr to exclaime agaynſt her mobylitie, if it were not for the ſhortnes of tyme and that I wil not cloye your memory, wyth ſo tedious a diſcourſe howe manye haue wee féene at the point to enioye a monarkye, kingdom or ſiegneury, who when they leaſte thought of commutacion or change, haue loſte their honoure, expulſed their eſtates, and at laſte ended their lyues by a miſerable death. Who haue redde the ſixte. booke of VALERIVS MAXIMVS may iuſtefye my opynion by thexample of QVINTVS SCIPIO a valiant capteyne and conſull in Rome, who, longe tyme hauinge fortune at commaundement Quintus Scipio was ſeene in a moment cut in morſelles ſeruinge as vnworthie foode to the rauenouſe beaſtes iſſuinge oute of the ſauage deſarts RADAGASO ſometime king of the GOTHES for all thaſſuerance he reappoſed in his inuincible armye (as he thought) was not expempted frome the

dome of inconſtante and mortall deſtynie, for that his people ſlaine, his capteines fled, and he taken pryſoner, paſſed vnder the ſentence of an infamous deathe by STILICON generall of tharmye at that time for themprour HONORIVS, wyth other infynit proffes of antiquitie, wherwith it is no neede to fyll my paper, ſeinge the domeſticall accedentes and like chaunces happeninge amongeſt our neighboures at hoame, do giue ſufficient teſtymonye and faithe of that whiche wee go aboute to proue. And nowe beinge vpon the diſcourſe of LIVIO and his vnfortunat CAMILLA, who albeit were ney ther princes nor gouernors of kingdomes, yet beinge in the paradiſe of their pleaſure and at the pointe to performe the laſt acte of their delytes, encountred in one moment a chang and ſyniſter ſubuercion all contrarye to the appointmente whiche they had reſolued vpon their future mariage, And ſewer it is an argumēt of the greateſt folly that can bée to promiſſe our ſelues an aſſurance of thinges whiche depende vppon the will and diſpocition of an other, vppon whiche the yſſue is alſo moſt vncerteine, for that differing frō vs in coun cell and ymaginacion, they are alſo without care in what ſort wée take their iudgement, ſeinge they depende no waye vpō vs nor our fancy: like as it happened to theſe .ii. infortunat louers for CLAVDIO nowe retorned, and not likinge any way thallyance betwene LYVYO and ſiſter wrought ſo muche with his father (who ſawe not but by the eyes of his ſon, nor attempted any thinge wherinto CLAVDIO added not the concluſion that REINALDO renounced the words of his former conſent pacifyenge the parents of LIVIO, by the beſte parſwacions he cold ymagyn, with thanks to the yong man equal to the greatnes of the honor whtche he offred in ſeking to be his ſon in law Theis newes were no ſoner ymparted to our ii. louers, but it is to be thoughte they eſcaped not without ſondrye alarams of mortall grefe, whiche had diſmiſſed their paſſions with the ende of their lynes; if it had not bene for the offer of a ſimple hope wherupon they grounded a new conſolaciō for yt they exſpected at length a remorce

in tholde man (by reaſon of his promiſſe) to iuſtefye the contract alreadie paſſed betwene theim two, wherof CAMILLA as pinched wyth a grudge of more wronge then thother, for that ſhe ſawe the vniuſte malice of her brother was thonly ſtaie of theffecte of her determynacion entred into a paſſion of ſuche frettinge conceites tempered wyth a mortall hate to CLAVDIO, an indiſſoluble zeale to her ſeruante, and a iuſte diſpite agaynſt the debylitie of her father, that ſhe was at the point to vſe force agaynſt her ſelfe, and aduance theffect yf their malice by her vntymely death, wherein becauſe ſhe woulde not diſcouer openly, that which was not yet douted of any, ſhee retired to a moderation in her greefe till the firſte parte of the eueninge beyng ſpent, the deſier of ſleepe ſomoned euery man to wythdraw hymſelfe to his lodginge when ſhe in her chamber wyth thonly company of her womā began to burſt out into newe termes of complainte curſing the hower of her birthe, accuſinge the weaknes and wante of corage in her father, but chiefely enueihed againſte thunhappie arryuall of her brother in thys ſorte. What iniuſtice The complainte of Camilla. or crueltie is this of the heauens to giue vs a harte to chuſe and libertie to loue one of equall deſyer and ſemblable will and then to bar vs the priuiledge of that fredom in not makinge a perfection of that whych nature hath ſett abroche in vs by the communyon and coniunction of our thoughtes? is it reaſon the bodye be more reſpected then the mynde, in that the harte and inwarde partes making a choice of affection ſholde not haue authorytie to ſommon the bodye as their ſubiecte to obey thinſtinctes and ſuggeſtions of the ſpirite, nature ſewer doth abuſe her reputacion in this caſe to coyfe her creatures with thattyre of loue, makynge a mutuall conſente in both parties and then to denie the conſommacion of the thinge her ſelfe did fyrſt begyn in vs? from whence comes thiniquitie of that lawe which alloweth a father for his pleaſure only and with out iuſtice to force an inclynacion of his children to that which is neither neceſſarye nor conueniente for theim? is it not ſufficient alas that we yelde theym

honoure, with the tribute of our dutie and ſeruice, that wee giue ſoccour to their olde yeres, and attempte nothing without their conſent, but that wee muſte be ſubiect to a further tyrannye in performinge the ſentence of their thraldom althoughe it dyffer whallye from our will and choice? And if mariage be a free coniunction, dependinge vppon an vnytie or conformetie of both partes, how can I refuce that wherof is paſſed alredye a confirmacion, or admit other huſband thē hee to whom I ham bounde by vowe of conſente. A H this is one of the frutes of tyrannouſe loue, to worke the effecte of a conſente betwene vs, withoute leauinge vs a meane to brynge the ſame to perfection, or ſuffer vs to conſider whether the parties knitt together by vnytie of affection in ſpirite, might alſo be aſſiſted with a coniunction of the bodies without offence to god or the worlde, but what? why do I enter into tearmes of iuſtice wyth hym, who is no way partaker of reaſon, and who is ſo ſoddaine and vncerteine in his Loue is naked and vvith out eyes enterpriſes, that he neyther takes aduiſe afore he ſtrike, nor vſeth leaſure to delyberat or foreſee the ſucceſſe of any thing he beginneth, for as he is naked and without eyes, ſo is hee boyde of iudgement, and vnconſtante in all his doings, aſſailinge commonly the hartes of ſuche as hee fyndes ydle and leaſte occupyed with vertue: Ah ſpiteful diſdayne of kynred, and vnnaturall malice of a brother, in what ſorte haue I deſerued this harde pennance at thy hande, to depryue me of the thinge wherin I tooke moſte pleaſure, wherein hath the curteyſe LIVIO, offended the, if not that his honeſtie excedes thy rude diſpoſition, and vertue giueth cauſe of ſhame to thy wicked will, or paraduenture thou diſdaineſt his iuſt merit, for that he is better fauored in al companies then thy ſelfe? And is it reaſon that thy conſente confirme my affection? why ſholde my aduancement depende vppon thy good wyll, or the choice of my huſbande aſke councell of thy conſente? ſhall I be ſubiecte to hym who hathe no authoritye ouer me, but by an encrochement of yeres, for that he is the eldeſt ſon of my father? hath he any pryuiledge that waye, to gouerne

my will, or geue lawes to my fancie, nothinge leſſe, for my father hath alreadie paſte thaccorde betwene LIVIO and me but you wyll ſaye paraduenture vnder a condicion, a ſimple article I confeſſe, whiche alſo is of no force, if the partie bee voide of pretence of preiudice? And wherin ſhall it be eyther preiudiciall or proffitable to him, if LIVIO be my huſbande? ſeinge it belongeth to my father to depart with my dowery and porcion of mariage, and my huſbande to diſpoſe it without interuption ſo longe as hee is a member of lyfe, what weakenes is this in a father to be gouerned whollye by the breath of his ſon, whoſe vniuſte malice rather then argumēt of reaſon makes him renownce the worde of his honour in a caſe touchinge the quiett and conſolation of her, who ought to be no leſſe deare vnto him, then her tyrannouſe brother, who when he hath expoſed the vttermoſte effecte of his ſpite, & that I am to be beſtowed in an other place by his appointment, it ſhall appeare whether his commaundemente be as currante ouer mée then, as his malice rageth without meaſure or reaſon at this preſent, proteſtinge by the height of the heauens, that none other then hee to whom I haue pawned my faieth ſhall enioye the chaſte acquaintance of thinfortunat CAMILLA: no LIVIO is myne, what wrong ſoeuer they do to our vertueſe loue, whiche ſo longe as I liue ſhalbe in dyſſoluble in me, beinge readye withall to refuce no thinge that may aduance the conſommacion of the mariage betwene me and him without whom I fele an ympoſſibilytie to liue: wherwith her paſſion grewe to ſuche a vehemencie, that her laſte wordes ended with the courſe of longer breathe, in ſuch ſorte that ſhee ſlyded ſoddainly from the ſeat wher ſhe ſate, and fell grouelinge vppon the grounde, reſigning with a dollorous ſkryke the vſe of vitall ayre, albeit the expedition of diligence in her womā procured with much ado a retorne of life, and with ſuch conſolacion and offer of hope as ſhee colde preferre, ſhee won her to go to bedde, where albeit the viewe of the wronge and diſcurteſye of her brother ſeamed for a tyme to ſtaie the courſe of ſleepe, yet

in the often repeticion of her ſorowes appeared a litle of qui ette, whiche cloſed her eyes and caſt her into a ſlomber wher in ſhe ſeamed to beholde ſtanding afore her thymage of her LIVIO halfe deade embraſing her with a pale and hydeous regarde, which forced her to ſuche a feare, that ſhe brake ſoddainely oute of her dredefull ſleape, ſpendinge the reſte of the wearye nighte in pytifull complaintes, wherin certeinly ſhe had raiſon, for that in that dreame or rather miſticall viſion, was fygured the deſaſter whiche not longe after ouerwhelmed theim bothe, neyther oughte wée to fynde it ſtrang if thapprehenſions appearing in our ſlepe, do geue vs warninge, of the good or euill happeninge vnto vs, for that wée haue certeine recordes which iuſtefye the ſame in the perſon of one BRVTVS hee whiche was vanquiſhed in the feldes of PHARSALEMO whether he were awake, or in the depthe Brutus vvarned of his ouerthrovve in his ſleepe. of his ſleepe, ſeamed to ſee in his tente a terrible ſhappe of a certaine ſprite pronouncinge his ouerthrow, beſides thauſhorytie of naturall reaſon mouethe vs to confeſſe, that as the ympreſſion of a greate feare, or longinge deſyer of any thinge do preſente often tymes affore the eyes of our mynde (the bodie beinge in reſte) the ymage of that whiche we loue or feare.

Here her brother knowing it a fault in all women to here them ſelues well ſpoken of and yet a chiefe meane to wynne theim to fede their humour with flatterings praies begā to ioine with her in commendacion of her honeſtie, affirmynge her chaſte conuerſation to bee no leſſe meritorious ſince ſhe was wydowe, then her pure virginitie generally allowed, and prayſed of all men afore ſhe was maried, which is the chiefeſt cauſe ſaid he that the Captayne deſiereth in honeſte ſorte to poſſeſſ you, but touching any ſiniſter ſucceſſe that might follow this ſacred league of lawfull matrimonye as ſhe ſeamed to predeſtinate within her ſelfe, he miniſtred perſuacions to to the contrary, alledginge the ſame to be a ſuperſtitious follye attributed to the auncientes of olde tyme, to calculat their good or ill ſucceſſe by the tunes or charme of byrdes, or ſomtime by the ſodaine encoūter of beaſtes or ſuche men as they loked not for, arguing ye ſame to bée ſuch abſolut ſignes of il lucke yt cōmonly they wolde refraine frō theyr affayres as ye day, & touching ye murmur & ſuſpiciō of the people whoſe tongs although they be naturally tipte wt the metal of ſlaū

But nowe to our pourpoſe, thagrement thus made betwene the fayre greke Ladye and don SPADO the valiant Capteine, ther lacked nothing for conſemacion of the mariage but thaſſiſtance of the rites and auncient ceremonies appoynted by order of holly churche, whiche the capteine forgat not to procure with all expedicion of tyme, and for the more honour and decoracion of the feaſt he had ther the preſence of the marques of MANTVA, beinge there not ſo much for the honour of the brydegrome, as to teſtefye to the open face of the world thearneſt affection he bare to her fyrſt huſbande RARZO, whom he accompted no leſſe deare vnto hym for credytt and truſte, then the neareſt frende of his blod. But now this albanoys enioy, eng thus the frutes of his deſier, colde not ſo wel brydel his preſent pleaſure, nor conceile the ſinguler contentment he conceiued by the encounter of his new myſtres, but in publike ſhow began to prate of his preſent felicitye, arguinge the ſame to be of greater moment, then if he had ben frankly reſtored to the tytle and dygnitie of a kingdome, geuing fortune alſo her peculiar thanks, that had kept this good torne in ſtore for him, ſaying yt ſhe cold not haue honored him with a greater preferment then to put him into the poſſeſſiō of her who was without a ſecond in al Europe.

iudging the diſpoſition of an other, by his own complerion, which was one of the greateſt faltes in this valyante ALBA NOYSE, who fearing euen nowe that which he nede not to dowte, began to ſtande in awe of his owne ſhadow, perſwadinge him ſelfe, that his wife was noleſſe liberall of her loue towards others, then to him, and that the benefit of her bewtie was as common to ſtraungers as to him ſelfe, albeit the good Ladye eſpyeng well enough, the gréefe of her huſband, was not ydle for her parte, to ſtudie the meanes to pleaſe him, and alſo to frame her life in ſuche wiſe euery waye that her chaſte and diſcrete gouernment towardes hym, mighte not only remouethe vaile of his late ſuſſpicion, but alſo take awaye the thicke miſte of frantike Ielowſie, that put him in ſuche diſquiet and made him ſo farr excede the lymites and bondes of diſcrecion, albeit her honeſte endeuor herein receiued a contrarye effecte, and as one borne vnder a crabbed conſtellacion, or ordeined rather to beare the malice of a froward deſteinye, ſhe cold not deuiſe a remedie for his diſeaſe nor any hearbe to purge his ſuſpicious humor, but the more ſhe ſought to prefer a ſhow of ſinceritie and honeſtie of life, the more grew the furye and rage of his peruerſe fancie, thinking the compainye and fellowſhip of his wife, to be as indifferente to others, as peculiar to him ſelfe.

How am I plunged in a paſſion of double extremetie, meyther content to diſclayme my affection, and leſſe hable to diſmiſſe the remembrance of hym that is the cauſe of my wo? I fynde nowe (alas to ſoone.) Howe iuſtelye we women mave exclayme againſte nature, who framynge vs of a brickle moulde apte to yelde, and eaſye to be wonne, hath enioyned vs withall a certeine vehemencie of affection, pearſynge the harte wyth deſyer in ſuche ſorte, as being once thorowlye coyffed wyth loue, we are not onelye forſaken, when wée wiſhe thieflye to embrace the obiect of oure appetit, but alſo are ſubiect to abyde all ſortes of reuenge of the ordinarye rigour of men. And what rigouro? wronge haue I offred the Dh CORNELIO wherof I haue not felte the firſte apprehencion? For forcyng my ſelfe to yelde the contentement, I ſpared not the proffer of myne honour to purchaſſe thy frendſhipp, and in gyuynge the aſſuraunce of my good wyll, I haue ſpotted the renowme

of my former reputacion, whereof the bloode of ſhame puttes me in remembraunce wyth grudge at ſo greate a faulte, and thy conſcience is my preſent witnes of my vnfayned loyaltye: neyther wyll the flatteryng lynes of thy ſondrie letters conceile this diſcurteſye, nor the meſſenger and faythfull ſolicitour of oure loue, forgett to reproche the of vnconſtaunt behauyour to thy loyall PLAVDINA, who feelynge now what it is to lacke the ſocietye of hym, whome the harte hath choſen to loue, is equallie pinched wyth the panges of ſuche as plunged in the paſſion of deſyer, do wyſhe that they wante, and lacke the thynge they chieflye woulde haue, whereby they ſeame to noriſhe lyfe wyth the onely breathe of a ſimple and colde hope. But why am I ſo pertiall on myne owne behalfe, in exclaimyng againſte the diſcurteſye of hym, who peraduenture deſerueth not theis tearmes of blame? or why doe I not rather reſpect the true cauſe of his departure, ſturred vp (as it ſeameth) by the neceſſitye of the tyme, forcinge hym to habandon his parentes, countreye and reuenue, onles he wolde quenche the thirſte of his enemyes, wyth the abundance of his blood, and appeaſe theyr malyce wyth the price of his heade, certeinlye the vertues and gyftes of CORNELIO acquite hym of all argumentes of inconſtancie neyther can a bodye of ſo rare perfection harbor ſuche dyſſemblynge diſpoſicion. But as the deſyerous harte is ſeldome at reſt, The deſyerous harte is ſeldom at reſt and doubtefull mindes dreede alvvayes deceite. ſo the doubtefull mynde is dreadefull of deceite, and quareliynge continuallye with his good hap or ſyniſter fortune, is alwayes in ymaginacion what iudgement to reſolue vppon the condition of his owne eſtate, ſo my caſe is of no leſſe perpleritie, for wafting indifferētly betwene happie chaunce, & euil ſucceſſe, I fele my ſelfe double paſſioned, ſomtime moued to reioice my good hap, in beīg loued of ſo honeſt curteouſe, & noble a gentlemā as Cornelio, and by & by driuen to inueighe againſte my euill fortune, that hath put ſuche diſtance and ſeperacion of oure bodies when we weare at

point to performe the conſommacion of our acquaintaunce. And albeit the common chaunces of this worlde reſemble a confection made of hony and gall, and that the banquettes of loue, beinge garniſhed with diſhes of both ſortes, will vs to make choice wyth deliberacion, alledgynge that the pleaſure is not ſo great, as the repentaunce & penaunce of harde diſgeſtion, yet I thinke the vertue to performe the vowe of the hart, takes awaye the greatnes and haynous diſpoſicion of the faulte, wherefore ſeing my hart hath made his choice, and the reſte of my partes reſolued to performe the queſt, I wyll not onelye diſmiſſe all doubtes of the aſſurance of his good wyll, but ſtudye to excede hym in affection, deuiſinge the meanes from henſfurth, to make hym féele the force of my goodwill, with the deſyer I haue to knitt an indiſſoluble vnitye of the ij. mindes, whoſe bodies are forced to lyue in ſeperacion by the malice of the worlde, and angrie dome of our fortune.
            Here yf PLAVDINA inueighed onely vpon ij. pointes of her deſaſter, the one for the ſoddaine departure of her frende and the other for the doubte ſhe ſeamed to put in the aſſuraunce of his loue, it is to bée thoughte that CORNELIO had cauſe of treble complaint, bothe to be driuen to ſaue his lyfe by cowardlye flighte, to ſteale awaye in ſuche ſecret & ſcilent maner, as only his guide was pryuie to his goinge, & alſo to bée diſtreſſed with ſuch ſhortnes of time, that he was barred to ſeame thankeful to his Ladye with a ſimple farewel, whiche was ſufficient to ſturre vp her Ielous humour againſte hym, but that whiche exceded the reſt in greatnes of gréef, was that he had no man of truſt to carye her newes of his being, and muche leſſe durſte he communicat his buyſynes wyth any ſtraunger, neyther had he hope to be aduertiſed of the accurrantes of MYLLAN, nor meane to make reaport of his owne eſtate at MANTVA, for that he durſt not diſcouer the place of his preſent abode there, wherefore cryeng out of the conſtellation and clymat of his deſtynies, he complained his vnhappie caſe in this ſorte
            
               
If my offence were as greate, as my punyſhmente is greuous: I wolde thinke no ſubmiſſion worthie of place, nor The complaint of Cornelyo beinge in exile. my falte meete to be diſpenſed withall, or if I had as iuſtlye deſerued this wronge, as I am ſewer to ſuffer the ſmarte, I had no reaſon to commence cauſe of complaint agaynſte the malice of ye world, & much leſſe accuſe the iniquitye of preſent tyme, nor yet crye out of ye ſyniſter diſpoſition of fortune, to whom as the poetes ſeame to attribute ſome power ouer our worldly affaires (beſtowinge their indeuor therin I thinke) rather to féede the time and ymagynacions of the people, with a ſhape or figure of an vnconſtante creature, then wyth intente to perſwade a credit in ſo ſenceles an ymage: ſo I am alſo perſwaded by the preſent experience of her inconſtancie, that ſhe is not ſo liberall to geue, as readye to take awaye, a leſſe hable to contynue the felicitie wherwyth ſhe ſeames to flatter ye conceite of ye ſimple, for whō ſhe hath brought to beleue in her, ſhe makes manytimes more deſirous of glory then hable to receiue it: wherin who maye more iuſtely exclaime agaynſt her mobylitie, thē ye vnhappie CORNELIO, whō (being fauored wt ye offer of a reciprocal affection, and at the pointe to be put in the poſſeſſion of his deſyer) ſhee hath not only taken the praie out of my mouthe, but comitted me wyth cruelty, into the vale of extreme deſolacion: of what moment are ye greatnes of princes, or to what end ſerues honor or highe callinge, ſeinge bothe the one and the other are ſubiect to confucion, and readye to yelde at the leaſte poffe of winde that bloweth from a contrary ſhoare. Yet if I were a ſimple cytiſen or companion of meaner callinge, thennemie wolde neyther watche my doings wyth ſo manye eyes, nor purſewe my deathe by publike or pryuate inuacion, and I ſuffered to liue as free from the troubles and tumultes of the worlde, as farr from any care or accompte of the doings of great men, where nowe alas thonly heighte of my eſtate, tipped wyth the tytle of honor, depryueth me of thuſe of my contrey, ſocietie of my frendes, and contemplacion of the

Wherin Albeit hee ſpente certeine time, wyth ymagynacion that his Ladye harde the crye of his complaintes, and gaue iudgemente of his ſyde, for thaſſurance of his loyaltie, yet he forgat not to hawnte the companies of the Dames of MANTVA, refuſinge to reſemble in any wiſe the order of thoſe ſhaded louers who brought vp in the ſkoole of one ROMANTO TRISTANO, or leadinge therraunte and obſcure lyfe of AMYDES, do fill the ayre full of their dollorous ſighes, and ſekynge to recorde their paſſions in the depe and hidden caues of the earthe, The order of a deſolate louer. delyte not in the place and felowſhippe of good hawnte, neyther are they at any time ſo well in quiet, as when they feele their deſolate bodies ſhrowded vnder the ſhade of ſolitarye places, or when by longe ranginge the wildernes and deſerte landes, they fynde by chaunce ſome odd hermitage farr from the vſe and ordynary habitacion of men, where fedynge only vpon the hoalſomnes of the ayre, and ymagynacion of their owne conceit, they pyne away in exſpectation that ſome good Aungell or oracle, wyll appeare vnto theim The deſier of a deſperat louer. wyth the meſſage of good newes, or els the fatall ſentence of their lyfe.

in thaduenture, then gaine in the victorye) mighte ſet abroache the faltes of ſome of our contreywomen, I am contente to geue theim that they will haue by force, and retiringe to the place of my hiſtorie, declare vnto you the aunſwer of CORNELIO to the meſſenger. I am ſorye (ſaieth Cornelyo aunſvverethe the baude. he) the large honor and liberall offer whyche you ſeame to preſente vnto me on the behalfe of your Lady and myſtrys, is of a more highe momente, thenne eyther I am worthys to poſſeſſe, or hable to requite wyth equall merite, wherein becauſe the harde condition of my preſente ſtate, ſeames my chiefeſte enemye to ſoo greate a prefermente, I doubte howe to ſeame thankefull to her, and ſatiſfye the tyme both together, albeit as thinges ympoſſible are not to bee purſewed, and offences forced of neceſſitie are moſte meritorious of pardon, ſo beynge not hable to aunſwere her exſpectacion in counterchaunge of affection, I am onlye to racke the litle tallent that is lefte me to ſo highe a pyn, that onlye ſhee ſhall diſpoſe of my honor and lyfe wyth all that I haue in the worlde at her pleaſure, whyche it maye like her to vſe as a ſupplie of ye preſēt dutie and ſeruice ſhe demaundes at my hand, onelye being at this preſente not the maiſter of my ſelfe, nor the vſe of my harte in mine owne poſſeſſion, my ſute is that ſhee rather blame the wronge whiche time offreth to vs bothe, then note me of any diſdayne in refuſing the frendſhippe of her, who merites more then I am hable to performe: for if my harte were as frée from forreine and former bondes, as ſhée deſerueth to be ſerued, and that my affections did not excede thordenary ympreſſions whiche aſſaile the mynde of man, aſſure youre ſelfe ſhee ſhoulde not lyue longe vnſatyſfyed to her contentmente, and muche leſſe haue cauſe to enter into ſuſpection of Ieleous diſdaine in me, for retorning the offer of that which maye ſerue for a preſent to the greateſt prince in ITALY: neyther will I ſo much abuſe the proffer of her acquaintance, or cauſe of your cōming, as eyther her liberal offer, or vehemēcie of your importunities on her behalf, ſhal moue me to reſolue a worſeopynion or more ſlēder credyt on ye honor or honeſtie of her yt ſente

And who woulde ſeame of ſo ſlender iudgemente (onleſſe hee hadde quite diſclaimed the order of reaſon) that beinge proffered frelie that, whiche princes can not get by any ſute, and not onely deſired, but purſewed wyth greate inſtance, wolde let ſlippe the gyft of ſo good a fortune, and make chippes of the frendſhippe of ſo faire and curteons a Ladye: wyth what face dare you viſyt hereafter th aſſemblies of greate dames, hauynge committed ſo greate a falte on the behalfe of her, whoſe goodwill you do not deſerue, if her curteſye did not call you to that prefermēt? are you of opynion that the merite of your bewtie and other proporcion, excedes the honore and heighte of her that woeth you? ymagyn the ſame to bee of ſuche force, that it is hable to drawe Ladyes to doate of you euen vnto deathe, woulde you become ſo harde harted as to encreaſe your glorye, wyth thexployt of ſo great a crueltie? If you bee ſubiecte to ſoo fonde an humor, you muſte nedes bee incydente to the iuſte reuenge which the god of loue is readie to thonder vpon ſuch as ſeame to hold his loare in ſkornful contempte, whereof as I haue harde mo examples, then my ſkill is hable to reueile in good order, being neuer trained in the torning ouer of volumes & hiſtories, So I wiſhe chieflie the plage of NARCISSVS maye

put you in remembrance of your preſent ouerſighte, leaſte in diſdaininge the frendſhippe of ſuch as excell your ſelfe euery Narciſſus doateth vpon his ovvne ſhadovve. way, you doate vppon thymage of your owne ſhadowe, and by that meanes yelde treble vſurye to the wronge you offer her, whoſe loyall affection deſerueth a better rewarde then the retorne of a repulſe of ſo ſmall ymportance: wherwith CORNELIO cuttinge of the reſte of her waſpiſhe diſcourſe, deſyered her to preſſe him wyth no greater ymputacion, then his offence deſerued, for (ſaieth he) in tearminge me vnworthie of the title of curteſye, and that my hart is to harde to admit the impreſſion of loue, you rather ſlaunder me by ignorance, then accuſe me by iuſtice, ſeinge the onlye force of loue hath forced alreadie a vowe of my affection and harte to a Ladie of MILLAN, whoſe preſence albeit thiniquitie of fate hath taken from me for a time, yet ſhall the only remembrance and inwarde regard of her bewtie and vertue, ſuffice to miniſter ſufficient moderaciō & chiefe cōpfort during ye angry dome of my hard exile, neyther ſhal ye force of any enchauntment, and much leſſe ye charme of any intyſing perſwacion, preuaile ſo far ouer mée, as once to make mée tranſgreſſe the leaſte point of my confirmed loyaltie, wherein as the Salemandre lyues in the flame, ſo wyll I pyne away and conſume by péecemeale in the paſſion of true loue, til the angrye fates, ceaſſinge to wreake their malice vpon me, do place me in the poſſeſſion of the due méede of my merit.
            Here this olde enchauntreſſe vnderſtandinge the circumſtance and full of his diſeaſe, and that his harte was ſo thorowlie lymed with the bewtie of his Ladie at MILLAN, that it denied thimpreſſion of her offer, wherein albeit there appered an ympoſſibilitie to wythdrawe, or at leaſte to procure moderacion to the vehemencie of his affection, yet beinge no leſſe loath to take a foyle in her enterpriſe, then deſyerous to performe her charg to thuttermoſt, wyth intente to retorne the meſſeger of abſolute cōtentmēt, or vndowted diſpair, thoughte not to leaue hym till ſhee hadde Syfted and tryed euery ſynowe and vaine of his diſpoſicion, and hauinge but

one pece of retoricke remayninge, ſhée boolked it out vnder a couertely kinde of reprehending his folie in this forte, are you one of that vaine crue (ſaith ſhe) & archfooles of the world, that ſtriuing to bende ye bow of loyal louers, do make a glorie of a thing as requiſite in loue, as cowardnes or wāte of courage in the ſoldiour meinteining ſkirmiſh againſt the Conſtancie. enemie? do not you thinke that a woman of indifferent iudgement will not rather laughe at ſuch foyle in her ſeruant, then allowe his fonde conſtancie begon without reaſon, and kepte with ſo ſmall diſcrecion. And albeit it is glorye of a Ladye to be onely embraced and dearly beloued, & that they haue (as it were by a ſpeciall inſtinct of nature) a deſyer aboue all creatures to be the only poſſeſſours of the hartes of their louers, do you not thinke for all that, that they giue not leaue and libertye to theyr ſeruantes to make a ſeconde choyce or chaunge of miſtres, to thende they maye be thorowly reſolued of the loyaltie of their ſeruante, and he diſcerne the true difference betwene the affections of bothe his Ladies. And ſewer that hart is wroughte of ſtrange mettal, and the ſprite of ſlender capacitie, that being bounde (as it were) to a taſke, is ſubiect only to one ſimple deſyer, without power to beſtow his regardes in more places then one, admit conſtancie to be as greate a vertue as you make it, & that the faith in loue is to be kepte withoute violacion, I praye you in aſking you one queſtion by frendſhipp, let me be aunſwered by the veray touch and reaport of your conſcience, what aſſurance haue you of equalitye or ſemblable affection at the handes of your miſtrys of Myllan, whome you haue more reaſon to doubte, then cauſe to beleue? Do you thinke that you are only beloued, or that beinge puniſhed by exile, without greate hope efteſones to recouer you, ſhe can continue as faythfull for her parte, as you ſeame fooliſhe in beinge the ſlaue and ſubiect of an ymage or ſhadowe of a thynge ſo farre hence? no, no, do awaye theis toyes of ſmall ſubſtance, and let my experience Seigneur Cornelyo preſcribe you one chief and generall rule, that

no woman beinge once diſpoſed to loue, and hauynge the obiect of her fancie taken out of her preſence, is ſo hable to repreſſe the humour of deſyer, or correct thinſtigacion of her appetit, as it is eyther in her power to diſclaime at her pleaſure, or degenerat from that wherin ſhe hath a facilitie by nature: But as one ſpoiled of all reſiſtance & arguments of vertue, ſhe ceaſſeth not to followe the queſte of her licencious inclinacion, till ſhe haue founde a freſhe ſupplie to enter the lyſtes, and paye tharrerages of hym that firſt conquered the place. Women be neither equall wyth ſaintes nor like vnto angels, neyther are they made of other mettal then ſuche as is diſtilled of thimperfections of your ſelues, and in place of priuiledge or frée diſpence from the paſſions VVomen deriued of the imperfections of men. of loue, I affirme theim to excede all other creatures in the vehemencye of that impreſſion, and chieflye where the effect, doth not followe thaſſurance of the worde: for as the drawinge glaunces of the eye, and pleaſaunt platt of the tongue, is rather an earneſt penny of ye bargaine, then a ful conſommacion of thaggrement, ſo the hungrye appetit of the hart affected, is neuer ſatiſfyed to his contentement, till he haue taſted of the delicate frute growynge in the middeſt of thorcharde and paradiſe of loue, whiche onely concludes and knyttes vp the reſte of thimperfect bargain: wherein as I muſt confeſſe vnto you, that both the lawe of loyaltye is to be obſerued, and faith kepte inuyolable, where we fynde an vnitie of affection, and full effect of our deſyer Faith to be obſeruedvvhere the deſyer is performed. ſo to beſtowe loue in the ayre, and lyue without hope of the thing that is wiſhed, I accompte, it rather the part of a madman, then office of one that hath his wittes at cōmaūdemēt, nether doth the end of ſuche pynyng cōceites importe other cōſequence, then a loathſom wearines and vnnatural hate of lyf, with continuall exſpectation to dye, and an euerlaſtinge remembrance of his follye after hys death. And for your parte, comparynge the SYMPTOMES of your preſent paſſion, with thunlikelihod I ſée to haue ſpedie ende of youre

martirdom, you bringe in remembraunce the miſerable ſtate of ye ſimple ſparowhake, who being hooded to take away her wildnes, ſyttes al ye day longe beckinge vpon her Ieſſes and whettinge her beake vppon the pearche, rather in diſpaire then certein of the comming of her keper: let me pearce that harde harte of yours with perſwacions of reaſon, and ſeame not ſo raſhe in refuſinge the goodnes of fortune, who albeit is accompted an enemy to moſte menne, yet is ſhe alſo frendlie to ſome, and ymagyn that once in the courſe of your lyfe, ſhe kiſſeth your cheke, and holdeth her lapppe open with an offer of a good torne, whiche if you refuce, is not to be reclaimed efteſones by any arte or pollecie, Conuert your affection founded vpon ſuch ſlipper ſubſtaunce, and no leſſe incertaine of his due mede, into a ballance of equal frendſhippe and harte of ſemblable honor and vertue, and exchange at laſt theſe languiſhinge conceites that tormente youre pyninge ſpirite, for a pleaſure no leſſe precious then of great merite, who is no leſſe readie thē willing, & more apte to offer, then you hable to receiue, ceaſe henſfoorthe to loue vppon credyt and crye out of the ſhadowe or figure of a thinge, that hathe neyther eares to heare your complainte, nor meanes to releue your diſtreſſe, and thinke that the glorye of loue conſiſtes not in the ſimple deſyer of the mynde, nor in the fooliſhe prouocacions of our vaine conceites, but paſſing further, the pleaſante reward and tryumphe of that victorie, conſiſteth in the conſommacion of the worke, wythout the whiche, loue ſeameth no other thinge, then a bare plat or table whervpon the painter maye drawe what propercion hee lyſte. And truely as there is no manne happie in loue, nor hathe cauſe to vaunte of the victorye, but hée that encountrethe thobiecte of hys deſyer, ſoo mee thinketh a manne ſhoulde not loue that hee hathe not, nor deſyer the thynge that is vtterlye vnknowen vnto hym, I ſaye thus muche (Syr) becauſe youre reſolute affection towardes youre Ladye of MYLLAN ſeamethe rather to argue ann humor of

frenzye, then vertue in loue, and vayne opinion, then true effect, aduiſynge you for ende to haue a care of your ſelfe and ſpeciall regarde to this laſte requeſt of myne, that is, in leauyng the ſhryne to honor the ſainct, and to cloaſe your mouthe from gapinge after that you can not get, as the vuquiet dogge in the night that barketh at the ſhadowe of the Moone.

And albeyt I haue not yet taſted of the frute whiche all louers do wyſhe, and fewe happen to fynde, yet dare I accompte my ſelfe as depelye in the fauor of my abſent miſtrys, as the beſt of that happye companie, and ſuche weakelinges as accompte no vertue in loue, but in thencounter of their laſciuius deſyer, and can not reſt ſatiſfied except they crop the hearbe of pleaſure, are alwayes founde more liberall in wordes, then conſtant in loue, and more hoat in the begynnyng, then hable to continue

to the end, neyther do I ſee any experience to the contrary but that the paſſion whiche I ſuffer, ought rather too beare the true title of loue, then the ſurname of a ſimple deſier, ſeynge the delite I take in the remēbrance of her beautie, is no leſſe pleaſure vnto me, then if I had alredie performed and taſted of the delicat effect of loue, which I am determined to attende, tyl eyther the goodnes of a better fortune reſtore me to my deſert, or the force of death giue end to my deſolacion, willing you herewith to correct your iudgemēt, and ceſſe to inueyghe againſt her, whoſe conſtancie & vertue only, defaceth the vſurped comendacion of the moſt of your corrupte ſect: for the reſt: the iuſtice of my cauſe (I hope) wil make my excuſe tollerable in the opinion of her that ſent you, and for your paiues I can but yelde you the choice of a thouſande thankes: wherewith mother retrician tooke her leaue and retired with leſſe contentemēt in her bad ſucceſſe, then aſſured hope to preuaile in the beginning, towards her MANTVAN lady, to whom recounting efteſones ye particularities of her diſcourſe with CORNELIO ſhe cōcluded that, he beyng limed with an other buſhe, had no power to make a graūt of his good wil without a ſpecial paſport frō

paſſion of his painful torment which he chiefly deſyred & iuſtely deſerued, wherein as ſhe for her part wyſhed no leſſe to embrace hym, then he meritorius to poſſeſſe her, So albeit there paſſed certaine letters betwene theim ſeaminge rather to doble the deſier of theym both, then yeld moderatiō to the paſſion of either of theim, yet ſhe found the meanes to coaſte the malice of her fortune with a contrarye ſleyghte, by procuryng to her huſbande a iorneye of xx. or xxx. dayes traueil, wherevpon ſhe diſmiſſed imediatly a corrior to CORNELIO with the reaport of ye newes in this letter folowing.

But yf the power of the fleſhe, preuailynge aboue your reſiſtance hath ſturred vp this humor of hoat deſier, whiche ſeames to preſſe you ſo far that you make no conſcience to exchange your former glorie, for a title or ſurname of a fylthie adulteror, go not ſo far to ſeke your deſtruction, ſeing MANTVA preſentes you with ſufficiēt choice and change of releif, better cheape and with leſſ peril then the hazarde of reputation

            His firſt indeuor after his ſaffe arryual at MILLAN, was to ſend for an appoticarye, whoſe fidelitie he had earſt proued in the enterchaunge and conueighe of diuerſe letters betwene his Ladie and hym who not ſo much amazed to ſee hym there whom he loked not for, as glad of his comminge, for the contentement of Plaudina, aſſured hym of the departure of her huſbande, his ſecond diligence appeared in therpedicion he vſed to aduertiſe his miſtrys of his commynge, whom he requeſted by a letter vnder the conduit of this colcarior, to appoint a conueniēt leaſure, that he might ſpeake to her in ſecret, for (ſaith he) the conference I haue to impart with you, is of other importance, then to be debated in the hearyng of witneſſes, and much leſſe recorded by anye then the only preſence of our ſelues.

And as ſhe was one of the beſt Courtiars, paſſinge the reſt of the traine and troupe of Ladies in beautie, behauiour and other gyftes of flatterynge ſhowe, ſo was ſhe more courted wyth the continnall haunts and companie of the Gentlemen and Princes of ITALY, then any other of what degre ſo euer ſhe were, in ſuche ſort as at the inſtant and preſent approche of her ſeruant, ſhe was deuiſinge familiarlye with diuerſe Gentlemen of the Citie, who ſeing this maſque noblie mounted after the ſpaniſhe order make their ſtaye afore Plaudina, & ſhe for her part accepting their curteſye with a countenaunce more thankeful then of ordinarie, iudged his embaſſage to the Ladye to néede neyther ſecret witnes nor publike audience, wherfore not ignorant in thoffice of humanitie, and becauſe their preſence ſhold ſeame no impediment to the proffit or pleaſure of

            Here althoughe ye fortune of CORNELIO had hleſſed him, Cornelio aſtonied in the preſence of his Ladye. with doble felicitie at one inſtant, bothe in auoydynge the place of companie, and yelding hym large viewe of the preſence of his miſtreys without interupcion, yet loue ſeamed to ſturr vp ſuche alteracions and diuerſaty of amaze within him, that the vſe of his tonge was not only taken away, and the reſt of his partes, retired to a quyueryng feare, but alſo his eyes were ſo reſolued in the gredy gaze of her bowtie, that in place to do her honor with any deuiſe or ſhow of hys dutie by wordes, he broughte her in terror with the viewe of his dombe behauior, reſembling rather the ghaſtly figure of ZELIO POLINO, whom the poetes fayning to be enchaū

Wherewith albeit CORNELIO grudged at the ſpedie retourne of ye goodman, yet conuertyng the paſſion of thoſe heauy newes, into a conceit of preſent gladnes for the franke and liberall conſent of his Ladye, he contented hymſelfe wyth the offer of hys tyme and fortune, and yeldynge a lowe reuerence to hys loftye PLAVDINA, retired in haſte to his lodgynge, where attendynge the approche of his hower of appointement, wyth no leſſe deuocion, then the Papiſtes in Fraunce performe their ydolatrous pilgrimage to theyr ydoll Sainct Tronyon vppon the mont Auyon beſides Roan, or our ſuperſticious catholikes of England of late dayes to the holye

But PLAVDINA had doble reaſon in her deuiſe, both to aduertiſe her louer (as yt were in a viſyon) that albeit he was bownde to too longe a deuocion, in ſo vnſeamelye a temple, yet he ſhoulde not diſpair of the goodnes of a better fortune, and alſo not to ſeame Ialous of her indeuor and diligence in the redreſſe of his caſe, for that ſhe colde not (without great argument of ſuſpicion) habandon the companie of her huſbande, till ſhe had got him to bed, wherein notwithſtandyng her pollecie was no leſſe fruſtrate, and ſhe efteſones deceiued, then the poore ymage in the chemney aſſailed with the malice of a third miſchiefe, for her huſbande beynge in bed in hys owne cabynet, commaūded ij. of his men that had attended him in his iorney, to lye in the chamber wher CORNELIO had paſſed the miſtery of ſo many trāſes, which albeit PLAVDINA reſiſted to thuttermoſt ſhe cold do, yet (Mauger her hart) the authority of the goodman preuailed, albeit dowting the cold villains (rydyng all day in the froſt) wolde haue made a fier in the chymney, and either ſacrafiſed the ſainct that ment nothing leſſe thē to become a burnt offringe, or ſmothered as an innocent that deſerued not ſuch purgatorye, ſhe gaue ſpeciall charge, not

to light ſo much as a candle with in the chimney: for the reſt, ſhe prayed that the god and patrone of true louers wold take ſuch compaſſion of his preſent diſtreſſe, that if he denied him for that time the due guerdon of his rare and firme loyalty, yet at the leaſte hée wolde graunte him diſpence, and ſaffeconduit to paſſe thorow the pikes of his infortunat dangers, and as ſhe was thus in earneſt contemplacion to the maieſtie of the blinde god of loue for the ſafe delyueryé of her frende, wyth no leſſe care how to redeme him from the fylthye dongeon of the hollowe chymney wythout the raunſom of publike reproche to her ſelfe, and doble daunger to hym, and he alſo (for his parte) tyering of a patience perforce, with ſome hope and likelihod of good lucke notwithſtandinge, for that he had alreadie eſcaped ſuche .iii. hoat ſkirmiſhes of fortune, whom he iudged now to haue drawen the thred of her ſpite to an ende, beholde the alaram of the iiii. aſſalte, more vyolent then any of the reſt, and excedinge theim all in abſolute argumentes of perentory perills, for the iuſtice not ſatyſfyed of the morder, and harpinge ſtill vppon the confeſſion of him that firſt opened the preſumpciō, ſent hym in the garde of certeine officers to the Lord MOMBOYER, chiefe of the ſenat afore whō he aduowched (with new othe) the perticularyties of his former depoſicion, whervpon, was enioyned eftſones a ſtraite commandement to the iuſtice, to make a ſe conde ſearche in the houſe of PLAVDINA, who if ſhe were now more a mazed then afore, & almoſt at point to yeld, to diſ pair, it is to be thought pore CORNELIO, had no leſſe cauſe of diſquiet, for that yeldinge himſelf alreadie dyſcouered by his enemies, he iudged the new broyle and clattering of roſtye halbardes, to be meſſengers ſente by the iudge to apprehende him, wherein his opinion was the rather confirmed, for that aſſone as they were within the houſe, and afore the good man colde make himſelfe readie to méete theim, they made no ſtaie till they came to the chamber of the ſelly houſdoue in the chymney, wher fynding by euill happ a caſe with

by the ii. ſeruantes ſleping in their owne miſfortune, rather wearye with their longe iorneye, then likely to cōmit a morder, they condemned theim by and by, as guiltie of the fact, wherwyth omittinge no rigour of their office, they coppled the ii. innocentes together in a ſcarffe of hemp, wherin as the goodman made haſt to come to the reſkew of his men, he was encountred by the way, by certeine ſergeants or crymynall officers, who arreſting him as pryſoner on the behalfe of the king, ledd hym captyffe to the caſtell amongeſt the reſt of his miſerable ſeruantes, neyther colde hée bée ſuffred to commence matter for his own iuſtifycaciō, nor haue indifferencie in excuſing thinnocency of his men, ſuch was the rage of theſe Rakehells and officers of hel, who are commonly more preſt to oppreſſe innocencie by vyolence, then readie to doo iuſtice ſincerelie accordynge to theyr othe and dutie.
            Here although fortune began to change complexion, and moderate ſomwhat her angrye clymat towardes our ſorowfullouers, by lockyng the huſband wyth the moſte of his ſeruantés in cloſe pryſon, yet this happie torne of her whéele vnloked for, ſeamed ſuch a myſt to the mind of CORNELIO, that he was not hable to deſcerne that which his hart dyd dyuyne, nor beleue that fortune vpon ſuch a ſoddaine, cold conuert her angrie and wrathful humor into ſuche ſpedie compaſſion, neyther cold the conceites of his doubtfull hart geue other iudgement, then that the laſte retire and departure of the guarde, was rather a viſion or dreame, then a thing of effect: ſuch bée the ordynary allaroms appointed to quarell The doubtefull mynd is rather apt to beleue the vvorſte then credyt thinges that b

and aſſailed rather with doble diſpair, then hable to admit any ſimple proffer of hope, in ſuch ſorte as deuiſinge to what ſainte to vowe himſelfe, he put his ſpeciall and chiefe confidence at laſte in his praiers to the great God, whom he deſyred aboue all thinges with teares to defend his deare PLAVDINA from any note of infamie or ſhame by his meanes, & for himſelfe, if his glaſſe were now run out, and the dome of his extreme deſtynies colde bée no longer deferred, that at the leaſt hée would, by the hand of ſome Aungell and other vertue of great miracle, beſtow him in ſome ſoile vnknowen, afore the fates had ful power to execute the vttermoſt of their rigorous commiſſion, proteſting notwithſtandinge, that if he might bée deſpenſed withall for this one falt, neuer to bée found ſo forgetful of himſelfe hereafter, if God and nature wéere content to ſeale him an aſſurance of the race and yeres of NESTOR. PLAVDINA on thother ſyde ſeamed indyffrent lye paſſioned betwene diſſembled ſorow and aſſured gladnes, a forced grudge and an vnfained ioye, greuinge in the one, for thimpriſonement of her huſband, whoſe innocencye ſhée knew dyd warrant his belyuerie, and reioyſinge in the other, for that contrary to her exſpectacion, fortune had made the way open and geuen her conſent for the conſommacion of the banquet with her languiſhinge louer, whoſe ſafe and happie preſeruacion ſeamed more to delite her, thenne the remembrance of the hard and wrongful ympriſonement of her huſband greued her, neyther was ſhe ſo carefull to redeme him from captiuitye, as readie-wyth great deuocion to geue loue and fortune their peculyar thankes, the one for that in preſeruing his champions from the malice of daunger and marke of open ſhame, ſeamed to reſtore the felde, and aſſiſt theim with ſoccour, whenne they diſpaired moſt of conſolacion, the other, for that contrary to her nature and cuſ tume, ſhe had torned theirmanifold afflictions into a pleaſure more precious & acceptable, thē al ye deſaſters of ye whole worlde ſeamed greuous, or hurtfull, in which paſſion of ioye ſhée mounted into the chamber of Iacke of the clockhouſe, who

reſembling a red heyring dryed in the ſmoake agaynſt the beginning of the next lent, attended her comming wyth no leſſe deuocion then the Iews exſpect their MESSIAS, and albeit, the approch of preſent ioye, forcinge ſome teares in remembrance of the feare paſſed, ſeamed for the time to take away ye vſe and libertie of her tongue, yet ſhe cut of ye traunce of that pleaſant ſorowe without thaſſiſtance of any ſpecial countercharme, other then that whych proceded of a vehement deſyer to behold and ſpeake wyth her frend in the chymney, wherfore after ſhée had dryed and drained the wet humor of her waterie eyes, and diſmiſſed all argumentes of former dule, ſhe retired to her auncient complexion of ioy, and calling with a ſmyling voire to him in the topp of the rooffe, willed him to diſcend hardly from his darke troane and theatrie of hell, wher (ſayth ſhe) if god had not deuiſed the meane of your delyuerie, and ſeamed willing that you ſhold receiue the due guerdon of your loyaltie, in conſenting to commit my huſband to pryſon, you had ſtil remeined there, noriſhed with the vapour of ye moone, longer then eyther I wold haue wiſhed, or had bene neceſſarie for your health. Here albeit CORNELIO was ſufficiently perſwaded of the voice of his Ladie, and that he knew all the houſe to be voyed of ſuſpicion or cauſe of further daunger, yet the remembrance of his perill paſſed, preſented ſuch a feare to fall eftſones into the like perplection, that hée neyther beleued that which hée hard, nor durſt forſake his habytacion on highe, til he was ſommoned the ſecond tyme by his PLAVDINA, who by the help of her woman, reared a lather to the top of the loft where the grymy roode ſtode, who being diſcended and in the preſence of his Ladye, ſeamed no leſſe amaſed, then thoſe deſolate or rather dronken creatures, who wandring the night by vnknowen waies, do thinke theimſelues guided by the viſion of ſome ill ſpirit: And the wantō ladie on thother ſyde, ſeing the ghaſtlie aſtoniſhement of her frend, not much vnlike in cōplexion to the chymney ſwepers cōminge out of the yle of

               BERGAMASQVA cold not ſo moderat her preſent gladnes, but burſtinge into a ſoddaine laughter, ſhée ſeamed to crucifye the remembrance of the tragedie paſſed, wyth the ſingler contentment ſhée toke in beholdinge her CORNELIO, dyed (as it were) in the ſmotheringe tanfat of hyddeous collours: And albeit (you louers) who for a ſimple glée and reſpect of fauor of your Ladies, haue earſte bene ſprinkled, with the water of ſemblable affliction, and after (getting thupper hand of your fortune) poſſeſſe the preſence of your dames in ſuch oglye and deformed attire, canne beſt iudge of the preſent caſe of CORNELIO, I meane whether hée hadde more cauſe of ſhame, then aſtoniſhmente, iuſte anger againſt hys fortune, or reaſon to exclaime his miſhappe, chieflie for that he fonnd himſelf ſo braue a companion in the lothſom badge or lyuerye of the chymneye, and whether he had ſo greate courage to cōmunicate wyth his PLAVDYNA, reſembling the blacke knight or feryman of ZENOLOZ, as he ſhowed hymſelfe valyant, in thattempte of an enterpryſe of ſo great aduenture, yet thauthorytie of my hiſtorye aduoucheth thus farr of his doinges at that tyme, that notwithſtandinge the malice and diuerſitie of all his miſhapps, with the perfumed, figure and gréeſelie ſhow of himſelfe, he neyther loſte corage to demaunde the due méede and hyer of his daungerous traueile, nor forgat to do ſacrafiſe to his fortune for the retorn of her frendſhippe, affirminge there, that they dyd her wronge that chriſtenned her by the name of cruell, and ſuche no leſſe abuſed her, that tearmed her by the title of an vnrightuous or rigorous iudge, conſideringe ſhe doth but iuſtice ſometime to checke or chaſten our offences and we no reaſon to pleade for our ſelues but by appellacion to the pryuiledge of her fauor, neyther is ſhe cruell for euer, nor ſo maliciouſlye bente in the begynning, but ſhée is hable and will vſe moderacion in her angrie moode, and reſtore vs in the end, to treble contentacion. And like wiſe (ſayth hée) as the poore trauellour in a ſtrange contrey, hauynge once paſſed diuerſe light peperills

and daungers of no great ymportaunce, is not only made ſtrōger to encounter greater inconueniences, but alſo reſtored to a meruelous contentment & quiet of minde, whē wtout daunger hée may enioye his reſt, and record his perills paſte. Euen ſo fortune this night hathe geuen vs an experience of diuerſe deſaſters, bothe to vſe her aduertiſemente as a ſpeciall armour to reſyſte thaſſaltes of ſemblable accidents hereafter, and alſo to confirme our affections with a ſtronger bonde or vndoubted vnytie, makinge the pleaſures of our loue of greater price and moment after ſo ſharp ſtormes of raging tempeſtes. And what is hée that is worthie to taſte of the delites and pleaſures of the worlde, that is not hable to diſgeſte one ſimple pill of bitter confection: neyther dothe hope dekaie but with the ende of life, and the vertue of a moſt true and inuincible loyaltie, is neuer fruſtrate nor voyed of his rewarde, and tochinge the ſtormes paſte (my deare PLAV DINA) ſaith he, like as it is a chiefe conſolacion to a man in calamytie to knowe his miſhapp, ſo there is alſo a ſpeciall compfort that followeth the remembrance of the euills whiche wée haue alredie ſuffred, and a treble contentmente beinge permitted to recorde theim wythout daunger, and hée that is deſierous to bée crowned with the garland and glorie of victorie, muſt not feare the malice of perill nor hazarde of lyfe, for who contemneth death, eſcapeth his malice, but ſuch as feare and flée from hym, do often fal into his daunger, neither is there leſſe fame in the valyant aduenture, then in the fortunat victorie, And for my parte, if my lyfe had ended in thaſſalte of any of theſe diſtreſſes, the ſame had not exceded a ſimple oblation of my dutie towardes you, whiche alſo had followed wyth no leſſe expedicion, then I had great deſyer to geue you ſo vnfayned a ſhewe of my ſeruice, if in the verye act, had not appeared a manifeſt derogacion and cauſe of infamie to your honor, wherwith meaninge yet to prolonge his diſcourſe hée was interupted with the replie of PLAVDINA, who more deſyerous to taſte of the pleaſures to come, then willinge eftſones to prefer a ſecond view of ye miſchienes

paſſed, wiſhed hym to diſmiſſe the remembraunce of their former perils, and ſeame more willyng to embrace the gyfte of preſent time, for there is not ſo greate conſolacion in the recorde of our miſerie paſt, as cauſe of worthie annoye, if we ſeame vnthankefull to the newe offer or gyfte of oure fortune. And albeit (ſayth ſhe) ſome what ſmilynge, that your boldnes was more then deſerued praiſe, yet your felicitye you ſée, hath defended you from perill, and the raſhnes of the valyaunt, is often times tourned into an encreſe of his glorye, with double contentement not loked for wherwith embracinge her CORNELIO, ſhe helped to diſſorniſhe hym of his loathſom attire, and after he had purifyed his grymye bodye in ij. or iii. perfumed baines made for the purpoſe by the Chambriere whileſt they were in diſcourſe, they entred together the lyſtes in a faire féelde bed readye dreſſed, armed onely with naked weapons, where it is no leſſe harde for the ignoraunt to iudge theyr encounters, then impoſſible for thabſent to witnes who wan the price of the battayle, onelye I leaue the ſentence of them both to the reſolucion of you (my Lordes) that haue or wolde bée ſpeciall ſticklors in ſuche a combat, but thus muche I maye ymagine without offence, that the innocent hornſbye in the caſtell, founde not ſo muche pleaſure in his priſon, as CORNELIO toke delite beinge the lieutenant of his bedd, in daunſinge the maried mans rounde without other muſicke then the inſtrument of his wyfe, which both triumphynge indiffyrentlye ouer the infortunat and miſerable birde in the cage, & ratinge the pleaſures of the reſt of that nighte, with an aduauntage of vij. or biii. dayes more, at what intereſt they thought good, forgat not to dob hym that was abſent, knighte, of the forqued order of Vulcā. And albeit fortune ſhewed heare a maruelous partialitie & cōning in the cōueigh of this buyſines, I meane to aduaunce the attempte of the louer, by the oppreſſion and vniuſt captiuitie of the innocent huſbande, yet was not her fauor ſo cleare, but there appeared a threatenyng ſommāce

of ſpedie change, for that the good man being iuſtifyed with in vj. or vij. dayes tryall, was redemed from pryſon, whoſe delyuerie was not ſo acceptable to himſelf, as diſpleaſant to his ij. corriuals, whereof the one féedyng hym wyth the reuercion and leauynge of an other man, gaue hym onely the poſſeſſion of ſhapp and bodye of a woman wythout a hart. And the other wearye or cloyed with the toile of one kinde of exerciſe, or not hable any longer to mainteine the ſkirmiſhe without freſhe ſupplies, or fearynge peraduenture the torne of his fortune, who neuer yeldes vs pleaſure without a ſharp repentaunce in the ende, if we preuent not her dome by diſcrecion, was as willynge to reſigne the forte, as at the firſt, he ſcanted deſirous to enter the breache, wheruppon reſoluynge vpon an other time for the further conſommacion & complot of their felicitie, they departed, not without ſignes of ſecret ſorowe, appearynge by the teares ſtanding in their eyes, the one to her huſbande, who wearynge by ignorance, a forqued garland made of the leaues of the frée, wherof an other had coolled and cropped the frute, was content with that he founde, and reioyſed in his happy encounter, the other not without great daūger retired to Mantua, where takynge more pleaſure in the repeticion of his perils paſſed, then deſyrous (without better aduiſe) to reitterate or vndertake againe the lyke aduenture, he diſcourſed the whole to his frende DELIO, who for his parte, reioyſynge more in the ſaffe retorne of his frende, then commending his wiſdom in thattempt of ſo raſhe & perillous an enterpriſe, exclaimed againſt ye deteſtable rage & furie of loue, which as al antiquities do affirme, to be of more force & infection, then al the Ruberbe of Alexandria or antycyria is eyther hable to heale or delaie yt leaſt furie of ſo vncurable a poyſon, ſo ye familiar experiēce of this age, iuſtifiyng the proteſtaciō of former time, doth yeld vs ſuch diuerſities of exāples, touching ye raging diſpoſitiō of that frātike humour, yt we ought not only to ſhon ye aire of ſuch a peſtilēt plage, no les thē the mariner, yt goth a loofe & giueth place to the harde rockes in

the daungerous Occean, but alſo to ſtande ſo ſewerlye vpon our guarde, that we ſeame not once to lyſten to thintiſynge ſommance or lewer of ſo execrable corrupcion, who once takynge poſſeſſion of the ſenſible parts within vs, beſides that he ceaſſeth not to interrupte our quiett wyth continuall torment and paſſion, ſtretcheth yet his power ſo farr, that he bringes vs in caſe not only to commit our lyues to manifeſt perils, forgett the dutye of our conſcience, with breache of the commaundement of God, but alſo (to ſatiſfye the appetit of wanton lubricitie) he makes vs corrupt the puritie of the ſoule, with the ſpott of abhominable adulterye, a ſyn moſt apte of all other to incenſe the vengeance of God againſte vs, whereof we haue ſewer prooff in the deſtruction of Sodom and Gomorra wyth diuerſe other countreys and common welthes, whiche he hath plaged and brought to ruyne, for the onely lycencious lyuyng of the people.

Is he worthy to be admitted to feede the flocke, or beare the title of chriſtes ſhepherd, that lyues in more adultery, fornycation and dronkenes, then he that makes an only profeſſion of ſuche euil all the daies of his life? or how is he hable to reclaime ſuch as be out of the waye to ſaluacion, that deteſteth the

               acion of their exploites and exerciſes of vertue, wherin beſides an infinitie of examples procedyng of the wickednes of our time, I maye be bolde to confirme myne opinion with a familiar experience of an Abbot of Naples, whoſe younge diſcrecion, equall to the grenes of his yeres, made hym no leſſe inſufficient to gouerne the ſtate of hys vocation, then vnable euerye waye, to diſcharge thoffyce wherein he was inueſted by othe and habitt of religion, for hauyng alſo the conſente of noble race (whereof he was diſcended) to fauor the wilfull appetites of his vnbridled youthe, he toke more delite to aſſyſte the exerciſes of nobilitie, I meane in makynge one at all manner of daunſes, maſques, momeries, dreſſed for the honour of ladies with couered faces, and other recreacions of pleaſure conuenient onely for the courtyer, then to ſitt in the chapter houſe vppon reformation of hys monkes, or to ymploye any parte of hys tyme in the ſtudie of the ſacred volumes of the churche, he was alſo admitted a neceſſarye compagnion to ſome of the gouernours and capteines there, for that he kepte an ordynarye table and free diot for gentlemen, beynge a thynge moſt acceptable to the Spanyarde, who at hoame kepeth hym within the compaſſe of thyn and ſober chere, and abrode is nothynge inferiour to the deuourynge Almayne, reſemblynge by that meanes, the ſparynge order of the nigardes of olde tyme in

their drye and hungrye banquettes, and to the ſinne of thys exceſſes in delicate fare, he added an offence no leſſe hainous and moſte vnſeamely for any of his callynge, deuidyng the daye into howers, and howers into ymitacion of pleaſures, ſome tyme he was ſene in the ſtréetes in thattire of a gallād or younge courtiour, ſome tyme he viſited the hauntes and aſſemblies of ladies, courtyng ſuche of theym as he founde to giue moſte eare to hys ydle talke, neyther reſpectyng the opynion that paſſed of his lightnes touchynge the violacion of the hollye order of hys profeſſion, nor the diſhonor he dyd to the houſe from whence he diſcendid. But gloried rather in that he colde ſo artificiallye performe the partes of a Philantos or flatteryng louer, then in reuelyng the miſteries of the ſcrypture, to ſeame to ymitate the true ſimplicite of lyfe of hys vertuous predeceſſours in that place, wherevppon followed ymediatly a declaracion of the vile frutes of ſo vicius a lyfe, for as Mouſieur le Moyne paſſed one daye in great brauerye vppon hys footeclothe thorowe the fayreſt ſtréete of Naples, expoſyng a riche ſhowe by reaſon of the glée of the gold ſmithes ſhoppes, he glaunſed by chaunce vppon one of the faireſte women (as he thoughte) harbored at that tyme within the walles, and followynge the purſute of her beautye wyth a gredye gaſe of hys eye, (maugre hys harte) he was forced to a ſoddayne ſtaye ryghte ouer agaynſte the place where ſhée was, whyche tyme of abode, his eyes forgat not to imploie in takyng large meaſure & viewe of her proporcion euery waie, makinge ſuch reaporte to the harte and reſt of the interiour partes, that in one momente he became aſſailed with that wherin he was ignoraunt for experience, and leſſe aſſiſted with neceſſarie reſiſtaunce, féelyng within him a hoat warre betwene the ſenceſible partes of reaſon, & ſenſuall prouocation of ye fleſh, with a preſente captiuitie of Loue a common enemy to the eaſe of man. his auncient quiet by the cōmon enemie of the eaſe of man, which we call properly the paſſion of loue, who at this firſt encounter, rampired hymſelfe ſo ſtrongely within ye inward

The girle was the doughter of a goldſmith, no leſſe deare to the father, then extremelye beloued of her mother, both for her beauty and promptnes of wit, and alſo for that in her young yeres appeared ſuche argumentes and ſignes of vertue, that ſhe was noted the paragon and patorne of all degres of her tyme, for womāly behauiour, and nothyng inferiour to the beſt touching ye chaſt order and honeſt conueighe of her life, wherewith ſhe beautifyed the meane diſcente of her parents, and lefte a rare example to the Ladyes of greater callynge, who thinke, their renowme ſufficientlye confirmed by the height and honor of their houſe, without puttinge to the accion and effecte of vertue, which in dede, as it is the badge of true nobilitie, ſo it hath alſo authoritie to make noble the meaneſt diſcent that is, and truly as the vaine woman exalteth her ſelfe, like to the birdes, whoſe naturall lightnes conueighe theim to the ſtarres, I meane takes pleaſure in the abundance of her riches, preferreth the magnificencie of her houſe, ymagininge her beautie to be worthie to ſytt in the higheſt Theatrey of the world, ſo the wiſe woman is glorified, only in ye gifte of ſincere & pure ſimplicitie, wyth a wonderfull care to kepe her name without ſpott, and the courſe of her life ſo vpright, that the malice of euill tounges maye haue no power to enter, and muche leſſe perce with anye worthie ſlaunder, but nowe to our Ganſaldo, and amarous

Abbot, who bathing in the lake of his follies, thought as greate ympoſſibilitie to retire or diſmiſſe this firſte alaram or ſommonce of loue, as to comprehende all the water of thoccian within a litle vrynall, neyther wold he diſpoſe hymſelf to trie the force of any reſiſtance, but determined (at what price ſoeuer it wer) to ymparte his paſſion to the girle, which he ymagined would moue in her a conſent of reciprocall affection: here in the opinion of the poet is iuſtifyed ſayinge, that louers reapoſe a certeintie in dreames, and proclayme a ſewer victorie of thuncerteine obiect of their fancie, like as this fonde abbot being lymed with a ſimple looke or glaunce at vnwares, doth promiſe himſelfe the conqueſt of the pray, agaynſt whom he hath as yet vſed, neyther force nor pollicye and much leſſe dreſſed any ambuſhe, he forgat not euery day in the weke to make his purmenado on horſebacke in the ſtréet, wher dwelt the ſaint to whom he had vowed ſuch ſolemne deuocion, wherin for a more glorie of him ſelfe, and the rather to ſeduce the maide, hée appeared in ſeueral attire and chaung of horſe twiſe or thriſe a day, not forgettinge in paſſing by the houſe of the goldſmith, to take meaſure of the doare, glaunce vpon the windowes, and perce with the drawig regards of his eye thorow euery creuiſe of ye wal, to thēd hée myght encownter a ſeconde view of her, whoſe fyrſt regarde, had miniſtred vnto him the brothe of infection, and if fortune were content at any time to geue him a ſyght of her, whether it were at the doare or out of the window, or in other place which denied him fauor or libertie to ſpeake to her, I thinke he forgat not to expoſe arguments of his grefe, by the pitiful regards of his countenance, wanton torninge of the eye, and other meſſengers of his paſſion, arguing the torment he endewred for the deſier he had to do her ſeruice, he vnderſtode at laſt by ſecret inquiſition, what churche her mother haunted for the performing of her prayers, and that her doughter was her only companion in theſe deuocions, whither alſo hée directed his pilgrymage, and diſſymulinge with GOD, hée plaide thypocrite, in conuertinge his regardes

from thalter or place of leuacion, to beholde the bewtie of the goldſmithes daughter, the ſaint to whom his hart yelded moſt honor, making of the houſe of prayer ye ſhop or forge to frame iniquitie, exceding in this reſpect, the barbarouſe abuſe of the Etheniques turkes and infidells, who geue more reuerence to their Moſques, wher God is blaſepheimed and his Son abiured, then the chriſtians now a dayes to the temples and houſes dedicated to the Lord, to performe the miniſtracion of the ſacraments, with open publicacion of the wil of our ſauiour Chriſt, whom wyth ſaint Paule we ought to pray, for the ſubuercion of babilon, and reſtauracion of the true Church, diſperſed into diuers corners of the world, by the malice of the pope and his wicked diſciples, wherof this Abbot, being not the leaſt in authoritie, was nothing inferiour to the moſt abhominable in al vices, wherof he gaue ſufficiente proofe in two offences of equall deteſtacion, the one in ſeking to deflowre a mayde, contrarye to the othe of hys religion, the other in abuſinge the houſe of GOD as a place of bawdye practiſe, to performe theffecte of hys curſed deuiſe, beinge more deuowte in courtinge the Ladies of NAPLES, thenne curious to reforme thabuſes of his idle couente. But the girle notinge thinconſtant order of prayer in our reuerende father GONSALDO, to gether wyth hys wanton regardes full of laſciueous deſyer, ymagined by and by, wyth what yron the gentlemanne was ſhod, and to what ſainct hée would gladlye offer his candell, wherefore thinkinge it noo breache of good manner to playe mockhallyday wyth ſuch a maiſter foole, gaue hym ſkoape now and thenne to hehold her at large, and to beat the hammer more depe into his head, would requite his amarous glaunce wyth a ſemblable glée, and ſodaynly retire and vaniſh out of hys ſight wyth an angry farewel, as thoughe ſhée diſdayned his wanton offer, wyth intente notwythſtandynge to ſhonne hys voyce and place of preſence no leſſe, then thincounter of any venemus beaſte,

fearinge to reapoſe eyther credytt in hys honeſtie, or ſo muche aſſurance in her owne pudicitie, as to open her eare to the charme of a friuolous louer, or who thinkes it no offence to take awaye the puritie of a mayde, whom wée may compare to the red roſe, deſiered of enery one ſo longe, as the morning dewe mainteineth hym, in odyferous ſmell and pleaſaunt coollor, but when the force and heate of the ſon hath mortyfied hys oryent hew, and conuerted hys naturall freſhnes into a withered leafe: the deſier to haue it dekaieth wyth the bewtye of the thynge, euenſo ſhée that hathe once morgaged the flower of her virginitie, is not only diſpiſed of hym to whom ſhée hath béene ſo prodigal of that whych ſhée oughte to make a moſte precious Iewell, but alſo in common contempte wyth all men, what ſhowe of diſſembled courteſie ſoeuer they preſente vnto her, wherof the miſtres of GONSALDO was nothing vnmindfull, who preferringe the honor and reputacion of chaſtetie, affore all the reſpecttes of the worlde, ſeing wythall that the blinde Abbot purſewed more and more his amarous queſt, preuented hys expedicion, by making her a ſtraunger to his preſence, ſhonnynge all places of hys repaire, and to take awaye all occaſions that myghte geue increaſe to his deſyer, ſhée forbare to viſit the churches, oneleſſe it were at ſuche howers as they were voyde of other companie, and yet wyth ſuche regarde, that ſhée made (as it were) a priuy ſearche in all the corners and quyers of the temple, to preuent his ſubteltie in dreſſinge ſome ambuſhe to inuade her vppon a ſoddaine, and if by chaunce hée ſaw her and ſaluted her in the ſtréetes, ſhee croſſed ſaite on the other ſide, and cloſed her eyes, as agaynſt ſome hurtfull encownter, yelding hym no other countenance then ſhe mighte haue auowched to the moſt infydell in the vttermoſt Ilandes of Tartaria whych brought the ſely freare into ſuche mortall perplexitie, that diſpaire beganne to appeare, wyth thapproche of ſondrye perentorie diſeaſes, chiefly for yt the hyer of his earneſt loue was retorned with ſondry ſorts of crueltye

and diſdainefull repulſes, occupyinge his brayne with ſuche contrarietie of thoughtes, that he was voide of councell to what ſaint to vow himſelfe, or vpon what wood to make his arrowes, ſeinge he was neither hable to mortifye nor vſe moderacion in his paſſion, and muche leſſe was aſſiſted with any meane to communicate the greatnes of his gréefe to her, whoſe beautie had made hym the ſlaue of follie, wherein albeit he ſawe a vanitie to vſe the office of a Dariolleta or bawde, for that the vertue of the maide argued a deteſtation of ſuche Embaſſadors, and to write to her appeared a great difficultie, for that ſhe was alwayes in the preſence of her mother, who vſinge the vertue of her doughter as a ſolace of her olde yeres, was no leſſe carefull of her honeſtie, then be longed to ſo precious a Iewell, yet felinge a continuall aggrauation of deſyer, wyth a flatterynge offer of loue to rewarde hym in the ende, with the praye of his purſeute: he determined to ſuborne a ſhameles meſſenger to bewraye his ſhameful intente, and therefore put his requeſte vpon tearmes in a letter of this effecte. Yf my deſtenies had don execution The Abbot vvriteth to his miſtres. vppon my bodie, when firſte they brought me to the viewe of your beautie, I had not ben a preſente experience of your crueltye, nor you thoccaſion of my vnworthie torment, for if death by nature, had preuented the begynnynge of my loue, I had ben frée from the force of paſſion, diſcharged of all mortall greefe, and you diſpenſed with al, from the imputation & cauſe of a double ill, the one to abuſe the vertue of your ſelfe, & do wronge to the renowme of al women by preferring effectes of rigour, the other in diſdaynyng the ſeruice of him, whoſe life and death payſeth indifferentlye in the ballaunce of your good will, diſſemblynge alſo not to ſée the circunſtaunce of my loue, to driue me to deſperacion, and at the point to vſe vnnaturall force againſte my ſelfe? Howe often alas, haue I made you priuye to thinwarde affection of my mynde, by the outwarde regardes & glaunces of my exterior partes? Howe often haue you acknowledged the ſame by argument of ſemblable glée, and immediatly

denied the whole by a ſoddaine ſhowe of angrie complexion, eyther diſdayning vtterly thoffer of my ſeruice, as one vnworthie to enioye the preferment of your fauor, or dalyenge wyth my earneſt ſute, to geue increaſe to my paſſion. I haue often bene vpon the waye to diſcloſe vnto you by mouth, the thinge wherin your hart hath alreadie geuen iudgmente of my meaning, albeit the deſier not to offende you any waye hath ſtaide thexpedicion of my intent, ſuſpendyng my grefe, till the greatnes of the ſame hath forced a preſente vente wt this ſimple requeſte, that as, fearinge to ymparte the full of ſo great a matter to ſo vncerteine a meſſenger as a pece of paper, ſo it may pleaſe you to geue me credit of cōferēce, wher only our ſelues may be witneſſes of that whych I haue to diſcouer & am no longer hable to conceile, wherin if ther be any bonde of conſideracion in great Ladyes, on the behalf of the offer of their inferiours, ymagin how iuſtly I deſerue well of you, and wyth what reaſon you oughte to paſſe a graunte of ſo ſmall a fauor to hym, who is no leſſe hable (as you know) to procure your aduancement wyth what porcion of wealthe your ſelfe ſhall thinke good, then readye to performe all ſuch thinges as you ſhall but ymagyn and wiſhe to be don, wherof I ſende you a confirmacion herewith, ſealed with the othe of my religion, and with proteſtacion of the faythe and life of your moſte loyall and deſolate ſeruante.

            He had no ſoner written this letter, but he was in mynde eftſones to commit it into morſells, or to make it a ſacrafice in the fyer, diſpairing belike of the ſucceſſe, till at laſte the blind, guide and fyrſt author of his follie reprehendinge his want of corage, renforced hym to a forwardnes, perſwading Loue. hym that the beginning was good and argued a ſequeile of contentacion, the rather ſaieth, he for that the tender yeres wyth ſmall diſcrecion preferreth an ignorance in the girle of your meaning, & ſeing acceſſe and conference be denied, yt next pollicie is to vſe thaduantage of writinge whyche declareth theffect of that whyche is painted in the outwarde

               tyng, ſo the miſterie can not be wrought without the aſſiſtaunce of words, which fooliſhe ſuggeſtion reſtored the Abbot to a hope, & makyng conſcience to committ the conueigh to the creditt of anye of his couent, for that he doubted their wiſdome in performinge ſo ſecret an embaſſage, vſed thexpedicion by one of the vallettes of his chamber, whom after he had put in remembraunce, of thauncient fauours he had vſed on his behalfe, and howe much he reapoſed for hymſelf in the aſſurance of his fidelitie, he ſaid he was nowe to imploye his fayth and diligence in a buſynes of no leſſe value, then the price of his life, wherin ſayeth he, albeit thou maieſt conſter ſome part of my meaning by the circūſtaunce of the late chaunge and alteraciō thou haſte noted in me, iudgyng peraduenture the ſame to procede of ſome amarous humour, yet, althoughe I conſente and make good the conceite of thy fancie in that ſurmiſe, thow nor all the deuinours of the worlde can name her, who (as thou ſéeſt hath made me the flaue of her beautie, this is the ſecret wherin I am to make a laſt experience of thy indeuour and wiſedome, to make a preſente of theis letterrs to her, who hath not yet voucheſaffed to lende me the vſe of one ſimple regarde of fauor, to qualifye the heate of my burnynge martyrdom, wherewith he told him the name of his miſtres, the ſtréete and ſigne wher her father dwelte, with ſtraite commaundement in the ende, not to omitt any moment or offer of time that might ſeame to further ye executiō of his charge: the vallet glad to haue ſo good a meane to make declaration of his loyal zeale towardes his maiſter, admitted the enterpryſe & gaue hym aſſurāce of his diligence, willyng him in ye meane while not to loaſe corage, for that ſaith he there is no fortreſſe ſo wel defended, but at length it is rendred by compoſicion, or won by aſſaulte, wherewith the Abbott departed to his chamber flatteringe himſelfe with the promiſe of his

Let hym beſiege the forte, that is as gladde to yelde, as he readie to ſommon, and beſtowe his charmes and letters vppon thoſe, whoſe regarde and care of honor,

is equall to the malice of his meaning, and for your part let it ſuffice you that I pardon your firſt follie, and ceaſſe henſfurthe to procede any further, leaſt you be payde with the monie ordeyned to diſcharge the hyer of ſuche meſſengers, wherewith ſhe flonge oute of the churche and not without ſome paſſion of iuſte anger, repaired to her fathers houſe, not ympartynge anye parte of thaccident to any one of her parentes, truſtynge that as her deſier and intente was to liue in the trade of an honeſt woman, ſo God woulde aſſiſte her vertuous reſpecte and defende her chaſtetie agaynſt the malice of the wycked, ſhe douted to diſcouer the caſe to her mother, for feare ſome ſlaunder woulde haue followed, neyther durſte ſhe imparte it to tholdeman, leaſte in complainynge of the wronge, hys pouertie hadde béene founde to weake to contende agaynſte thautoritie of thabbot, and by that meanes to haue beene worſe delte with all then eyther he deſerued, or ſhe deſiered, but leauing in example to al women to vſe like modeſtie in ſemblable diſtreſſes, ſhee committed her ſelfe and cauſe to the protection of the heauens.

In whiche oportunitye and offer of thankefull tyme the blinde Abbott reapoſed a ſingler commoditie of his cauſe, for that as you haue harde he determined to inuade her wyth an ambuſhe at vnwares, and ſo rauiſhe her out of the handes of her parentes by mayne ſtrengthe, whereunto he added an effecte without regarde to the ſlaunder whiche attended ſo wicked an enterpriſe, or thabuſe he committed againſte the order of his religion, and muche leſſe the eſtimacion and honor of the houſe whereof he was diſcended. Let this experience ſuffice to confute the opinion of the moſt of our louers nowe a dayes, who makynge a God of the ydoll of loue, do not lett to giue hym place amonge the moſte perfect and heroicall vertues that are, affirmynge that all ciuilitye and curteys behauiour amongeſt men, is deriued of the diſcipline taughte in his ſkoole, let the effect of his rage I ſaye, declare his diſpoſicion, and be the equall iudge whether he be an indifferent euill or a pertiall vice, for ſettynge your partycular affections aparte, I knowe you wyll confyrme myne opinion thus farre, that, he whiche you cal loue and woulde that we honor hym wyth a tytle of a God, and giue hym a power more then humaine, is no other thinge, then a brutall paſſion of the minde deriued of that

parte whiche nature hath made comon to vs with beaſtes, touchynge ſenſualytie, and he which laboreth in the diſeaſe of that follie, is in no other degrée, then he that is poſſeſſed with the ſpirite of franſie and deſperation, looke in the ſeconde booke of the kynges, and tell me what planett or ſpirite gouerned AMNON the ſon of DAVID, who doatyng vppon the beautie of hys owne ſiſter, made no conſience to deflower her and take awaye her chaſtetie, whiche horrible acte woulde haue procured terrour to the moſt mortall enemye, both for the horrour and deteſtacion of the ſyn, and alſo for the honor and reuerence which all men oughte to gyue to the chaſtetie of a mayde. The prince of SICHEM being extremely enamored vppon the beautie of the doughter of Iacob, dyd it ſuffice hym onely to loue her in honeſte ſorte? dyd he ſtaye hym ſelf vppon your maſqued and dyſſymuled loyaltie? no, he dyd that which is iudged tollerable to you al and woulde be comon to the moſte of you, yf the rigour of the lawes, had you not in awe, and preferred a feare of tormentes and worthy puniſhmentes, he rauiſhed her by force, wherevppon followed the ruyne of hym ſelfe and ſubuercion of his people, for ende, yf there be any one amongeſt you that abſteyneth from lyke violacion, I thynke (ſewer) he is not ſtricken with thextremitie of loue, but that hys mynde hath taſted but of a ſimple impreſſion of that follie, ſeynge that he that is touched to the quycke, can hardly refraine frō execution of like villainies, amongeſt whom notwithſtanding I cōprehende not thintegretie of them, whoſe wills tende to do honor to the hollye bedd of mariage without violacion, for that I am perſwaded thoſe affections procede frome aboue, and approued by god hym ſelfe, but I inueigh againſte their vnhoneſte deſiers, who reſpect nothing but the pleaſure in that wherein Mars and Uenus ſtroue for the maiſterie, at ſuche tyme as vulcan diſcouered theyr naked bodies, which I can not terme ſo properly in our vulgare phraſe, as the frencheman includes in thies three wordes Le don damoureuſe mercy, the delite whereof, dekayinge

Here you may ſee alſo a worthie example in this maiſter Abbott, who of a paſtour and ſhepherde of the heard, becomes a deuowrer of the principal ſhepe in his flocke, and leauinge thabit and attire of religion, is inueſted with thaccotrementes of a villaine and dyſpoſicion of a barbarus Lyrant, that hathe neyther knowledge of God, nor feare of hys lawes, wherein my conſcience wolde ſerue me to vſe a further diſcourſe touchyng thabuſes in thies ypocrytes, ſauynge that (God be prayſed) our realme is happely purged of ſuche filth and repleniſhed with a plentifull crewe of thundowted, and faithfull myniſters of godes worde, neyther will I troble my hiſtorie with the ſondry enormities and practiſes of hell whyche I noted in ſome religius houſes in fraunce duryng my being there, becauſe my theame at this tyme, is not to treate of thabuſes in their religion, neyther am I aſſiſted with ſufficient time, for that yf I ſhould but abridge their diſorders into a tenthe parte, the volume wold excede the bignes of the bible, wherfore it ſhall ſuffice me to deſier God in my praiers to remoue the vaile of their darkenes in tyme, leaſte their iniquitie procure hym to thonder lyke deſolation vppon theym, as he dyd vppon the children of Iſraell, when they forſo

put no difference betwene Carters and men of greater callynge, and this Demygreque prayed onely vppon nobilitye and ympes of tender yeres, wherin albeit ſhe ſeamed more delicate of taſte then the other, yet ſhe exceded all the Bancrowtes of honor that euer were, in this one point, that ſhe was alwayes rather wearie of trauell, then at any time ſatiſfyed with pleaſure, reſemblynge a bottomles goolphe, receyuinge all that is putt into it, without caſtynge anye thinge vpp againe: this was the chaſte lyfe, whiche this good Ladie ledd after ſhe had got the bit betwene her téeth, and the raine of libertie within her owne hande, whereby you maye iudge, whether the Myllanoyſe or firſt huſbande had raiſon to refraine her forwarde inclinacion in the firſte flame of her youth, ſeinge that as the gréene ozier or ſallow of ij. or iij. yeres groth, is alwayes more plyable then the greate oke, ſeaſoned either by pollecie or confirmed in hardnes by the continuance of many yeres, ſo it is neceſſarie we kepe an awful hande vppon ſuche youngelynges, as appeare ſooner ripe in appetit, then in gouernement or diſcrecion, to the ende that in plyeng the wax whileſt the water is warme, we maye alwayes frame them to the poſteye of our mindes, hauynge theim to ſupplie the neceſſitye of our affaires. And as the connynge grafter forſeing the deſtruction of his ſtocke, by the tomuche forwardnes of the twigges, and certeine lytle hraunches, ſukyng vp the moyſture and ſapp, whiche ſhould féede the reſte of the trée, doth cut theim awaye, to thende the principall bowes maye floriſhe, and receiue their naturall norriture, ſo it is not ſufficient to miniſter correction to youth in their tender yeres, yf we reſerue not a continuation of awe, to accompanie their encreaſe & ripenes of their age, to preuent the harmes wée ſée ordinarilye happen by maturitye and to muche forwardnes in deſyer to bee frée from controlment.
            As ſhe was in theis exerciſes at Pauya, continuynge a traine of ſeruauntes accordynge to her trade and ſtudie, it chaunced that therle of Maſsyne, called Ardizyno Valpergo, came to

The ſubtill counteſſe, albeit ſhe knew wel enough that the fyer was not ſo kindled in the ſtomake of therle, as it pleaſed hym to ſet a face and fayned ſhow of his paſſion, and that the large ſkoape of libertie in his tongue, wyth aſſurance & conſtancie in his countenance, argued rather a diſſembled zeale, then a true tranſport of affection in his harte, yet ſeing hym younge, Iuſtie, and ſufficient euery waye, to aunſwers and diſcharge the combat of her gredie deſyer, determyned not to lette ſlippe the offer of ſo fytt a praye, whyche ſhee thoughte woulde ſuffyce, to occupye the place,

till ſhe hadde fonnde an other to enter the lyſtes and ſupplie his lacke, wherwyth ſhe paſſed a plaine graunte of her fauor vnder theſe couerte tearmes: like as Signeur Valpergo

I am not ignorant in thordinarie deceites of men, declared ſpeciallie on the behalfe of ſuch, as reappoſinge to muche credit in their honeſtie, do geue ſlender garde of theimſelues, ſo I canne (I thanke god) contente my ſelfe to ſmile at their follies, and take pleaſante recreacion to heare the brauerie of their requeſts, ſeaming to burn in the deſires of loue, when in déede they are not only farr from ſuch paſſion, but frée from intent to performe any effect of true loyaltie, ſeaminge alſo to enterlarde their ymportunities wyth a doble vehemencye, when they go moſt buſilye abowte to make a praie of our bewtie and fragilitie, whereof albeit I accompt you not onlye one of the nomber, but alſo no leſſe deſloyall then any of the reſt, yet reſpectinge the reputacion of your race, I am content to geue credit to your wordes, and accept your offer in ſuch ſort as you haue promiſed, reappoſing ſo muche for my ſelfe in youre diſcrecion, that there ſhall appere in you no want of any thing that belongeth to the gouernmēt & wiſe conueigh of ſuch ſecret affaires, wherin if I fid an effect of my exſpectaciō, your ſelf ſhal iudge of my liberalitie, in retorning the merite of your honeſt frendſhipp, wherwyth thalteracion and breache of countenance in her face, argued a preſent troble and contrarietie of mynde with in her, whiche therle conſtruinge to procede of a deſyer ſhe had to moue hym to diſmiſſe all further delaies, and diſpoſe hymſelfe to thexecution of the thinge ſo indiffrentlie deſyered of theym bothe, put diligence to the thankefull offer of tyme and fortune, in ſuch ſorte, as embraſinge her wyth a thowſande ſortes of kyſſes, hee forgatt all ceremonies and circumſtaunces, and gaue her checkmatt wythoute any oddes, vppon a lowe bedde or pallet couered cloaſe with a vaile or canapie of crymoſyne veluet, frindged wyth ſyluer thrombe, where was ſuch indiffrente likinge on bothe partes, that they reſolued at thinſtaute of other times

and howers to méete at the ſhocke in ſo pleaſant a ſkirmiſhe, wherin as ſhe iudged hym hable enough to paſſe ye mooſters for ſuche reſpectes, determyninge to make ſtoare of hym, till fortune furniſhed her of a freſhe ſupplie, ſo for his part, he founde her ſo delicate on his behalfe, that he reſigned than thoritie whiche earſte gouerned hym and his doinges, to the order and derection of her, in ſuche ſort, as he ſpake nothing but by the mouthe of Blanche Marya, nor did any thing wherin her councell and commaundement bare not the greateſt ſwaighe, being ſo drowned in the deſyer of his beaſtelie trol, and blinded wyth the vaile of filthie loue, that both day and night were indiffrent for thexerciſe of his pleaſure, making her bedd his pryuate lodginge, and delicate armes his place of pleaſante excerciſe and tryall of actiuitie, wyth contynual aboade there, and that wyth ſuche publike ſignes and declaracion of his diſeordered lyuinge, that to the comfirmacion of the common brute whyche paſſed of their follies, there lacked but ſome PLAVTVS or TERENCE, to prefer it in publike ſtage, in the hearing of all the worlde. But what? is it like, that ſhee that had falſed her fayth to a huſbande, more honeſt and vertuous then ſhée deſerued, wold content herſelf wyth the companie of this younge erle, or who doubtes, but ſuche indiffrent women, as haue committed their bodies to the generall ſeruice of the worlde, are no leſſe inconſtante in their loue, then voyde of ſhame, in deueſtinge theim of honeſt vertue, to vndertake ſo badd a kinde of lyfe, neyther do they like ſo well of any thinge, as often change of diot, to ſatiſfye their inſatiable and beaſtelie luſte, ſeaminge as it were a champion or challenger, readie to aunſwere all commers, for a familiar proofe wherof, I commit you to thexperience of this rauenouſe ſhee wolfe BLANCHE MARIA, who ſeynge her newe mynyon ſo ſewerlie lymed wyth the bluſhe of her bewtie, that only a ſimple becke was ſufficient to commaunde hym, taught hym a newe croſcaprey, wyth a thouſand trickes and ſleightes in vawtynge, wherewyth

alſo addinge a further experience to his blinde ſimplicitie, ſhe brought hym now and then to the honor of holdinge the moyle at the doare, whileſt an other man ridd her errande in the chamber, whyche trafficke was not wythout greate perill on his parte, for that as the countey CELAND was borne to beare the badge of cornewal in the forme of a ſecond Acteon, ſo this younge prince was ordeined by deſtynie to loaſe hys lyfe, with exſpectation of al that he attended by the Acteon tranſformed into a hart by Dyana. ſeruice of kinges or forreine princes, by the wicked treaſon of a pernicious and common whoare, for in this entercourſe of her loue wyth SIGNEVR VALPERGO, and verye heat of thamarous glées betwene theim, fortune watchinge to enter the ſtage, and make ſene, that her mobylytie diffreth litle or nothinge from the diſpoſition and incerteintie of a woman, according to ye meaning of the poetes, whiche haue ſet her furth, in ſhape, attire, and coollours like to one of that ſect, gaue hym an ynklinge of thinconſtancie of his miſtrys, wherupon followed a litle dymynucion and reſtrainte of Fortune dravven in ſhape and attire of a vvoman. his company from her, who being whollie tranſformed into the forme of an vnreaſonable creature, delyting in nothing but to roune, ryot, and hunt for chaunge of paſture, had her eyes and mynde more geuen to glottonie, then her ſtomake hable to brooke the ſondry choice and ſortes of dyot, ymploying her ſelfe whollie to gather newe ſoldiours, to ſupplie the lacke of tholde garryſon and wearie capteine, wherein ſhe was aſſiſted, wyth more then a neceſſarie expedicion, for that wythin ſome xviii. or xx. dayes, after VALPERGO had taken poſſeſſion and entred the forte of the counteſſe, there arryued at PAVYA, SEIGNEVR SANSEVERINO earle of GAIAZO, whoſe promptenes of wit and perfection of bodie and membres, with a valyant corage of the harte, as they made his name and renowme excede all other, betwene that & the mountes, ſo thys deſloyal Aleyne & cruel Medea, had no ſoner takē a ſimple view on him, wt a flickering glance of her vncertein eye, but ſhe felt a mociō of vehemēt zeale ſturr

and kindle within her, whiche within ſhorte tyme grewe to tearmes of ſuche certeine affection, that ſhe which earſte had dalyed with all men, becomes now to doate vppon this new earle, and that in ſuch ſorte, that yf fortune wold not award preſent compaſſion, and loue lende her a ſpedie meane to recouer thobiect of her deſier, ſhe ſeamed not only to enter the tormentes of diſpair, but alſo to make ſmal accompte of the vſe of longer lyfe, iudging by thexterior and outewarde promiſes of this younge Lorde, that it was only he, that ſeamed ſufficient to quenche the thurſte of her greedie appetit, wherfore ſhe began to diſpatche her handes of her firſt frend Valpergo, with whom from that inſtant, ſhe did not onlye refuſe to ſpeake, but alſo ſhonninge all places of his preſence and repaire, wold not ſticke ſometime to ſhott her gates againſt hym, whych he colde not diſgeſt without certeine iniurious wordes and tearmes of reproche, whereuppon ſhe grounded a grudge of ſuche mortall enimitie and ſpite, againſte him, that her mynd reteined a remembrance of the quarrell, till her malice had procured his death, wherof the diſcourſe followeth in his place, deſiering (as yt ſeamed) thacquaintāce of therle Gainzo, aſwel for her aſſiſtāce in thexcucion of theffect of her preſēt ſpite, againſt Valpergo, as for the reſpect of true affection, wherein as ſhe was whoattlye called vppon by ij. earneſt ſolicitours, loue, and reuenge, the one ſewinge for a conſommacion of her wicked deuiſe, the other prickyng her with deſier to procure theffect of her newe affection wyth the ſeconde earle, to whom albeyt ſhe diſplayed ſuche manyfeſte ſygnes of good wyll, as eyther the arte of loue coulde imagyne, or her wanton and idle brayne deuiſe, yet ſeynge ſo ſlender a replye on his parte, withe an encreaſe of her burning appetite, ſhe thought it neceſſarie to put ſpurs to his dull diſpoſicion, makinge no conſcience to become the ſhameles clyent in a cauſe, wherin the moſt vile and ſimple woman that is, ſuffreth her ſelfe to be ſewed vnto with no ſmall adoo, wherein beinge voyde of meanes to vſe mutuall conference, ſhe makes this litle letter the meſſenger of her

            This embaſſage, with further commiſſion by the mouth of the bringer, ſturred vp no ſmal alteracion in the mynde

of the younge earle, chieflye for that he ſawe hymſelfe purſued with a franke offer of that, whiche (yf the affectioned zeale he bare to his deare frende and companion the Lorde Valpergo, had not ſtayed thattempte) he had ſoughts longe ſince to obteine. And albeit he iudged it neyther tollerable by humanitie, nor thoffice of a gentleman, to ſupplant the pleaſure of his frende, and marche in the ſteppes of his praye, yet being charmed (as it were) with the vehement wordes of the letter, with opinion that the diſcurteſie were to greate, to abuſe the liberal offer of ſo faire a Ladye, gaue place to the ſommonce and wente immediatlye to her houſe, where fyndynge her voyede of all companie in her bedd chamber, ſawe ſmall occaſion to preferr halfe the circumſtance and courtlike wooing, wiche Seigneur Valpergo vſed, for that both the one and the other, after certeine intiſinge kiſſes, and other drawyng allurements performed on both partes, diſpoſed themſelues tomake preſent ſacrifyce to the goddeſſe of loue, in putting an effect to the thyng which they both thirſted to accompliſh with equalitye of deſyer, which amarous practiſe continued betwen them certeine monethes, in ſuch ſorte, that therle was ſo aſſotted, & became ſo ydolatrous on her behalfe, that he performed no deuocion to other ſaint, ſauing the vnſeamely ſhryne of his new mynion, who alſo ſeing him ſtāde in water to the chin, & whollie ſubiect to the yoke of her awe, determined to kepe a harde hande of the bridle, with intent to make hym the bloddye executioner of her deteſtable deuiſe againſt her former louer Valpergo, whoſe felicitie defended him eyther frō the peril of that imaginacion, or els God wold not yet gyue leaue to her wickednes, for that her hope was deceiued touching any help or aſſiſtance of her newe frend, for Valpergo ſeing himſelf not onely diſpoſſeſſed of the loue of his Ladye, but diſhonored by her mouthe wyth diuerſe wordes of reproche in hys abſence, iudged it no grudge of conſcience to myniſter ſemblable reuenge on her behalfe, the rather for that ſhe was bothe the authour of the euyll,

euill, firſt breaker of her faithe without cauſe, and now the begyner of the quarrell of ſlaunder, wherefore departynge from PAVIA, he painted her diſhoneſtie vppon euerie poſte he paſſed by, blaſynge her armes, with ſuche baſe and vile coollours, and in ſuche liberall ſorte, that euerye companye whiche he haunted was pertaker of the renowne he gaue to Blanche Marya, who hearynge at laſte, what eſtymacion ſhe was in thorowe all LOMBARDIE, by the reapport of VALPERGO, began to enter into tearmes of rage, fyndynge a greate difficultie to dyſgeſte thyngratitude of her loſte louer, whoſe doynges notwithſtandynge ſhée allowed ſome tymes by iuſtice, and ſawe ſome reaſon in hys reuenge, for that her inorderlie dealynge opened the fyrſte way to his diſcurteſie, and by & by flattered her ſelfe, with a vaine ymagynacion, that menne were borne to beare what ympoſicions ſo euer ſuche tryflors as ſhe woulde laye vppon theyme, and that ſeynge they were but ſeruantes, they dyd but ryghte to endure and take in good parte any thynge ſayed or don by theyr miſtres, albeyt feedynge ſtill of her malicious coller, with a certeine ſecret deſyer of vengance determyned at laſte to retorne hys diſcourteſye with no leſſe intereſt then the loſſe of hys lyfe, with reſolucion to procure the ſpedy effect by the hande of hym, whom ſhe preſumed to haue ſo muche at commaundement, that a ſimple requeſte of her mouthe woulde make hym the miniſter of that.

ordynarye pacience, wherfore ſeinge the haynous cauſes of my gréefe, import a ſpeciall iuſtice and reaſon of reuenge, lett not the enemie of the honor of your deare Blanche Marya, eſcape wythout puniſhment, but in accomptynge the wronge whyche I ſuſteine, indifferent to vs bothe, to bynde me (by the benefytt of this reuenge) to a more affeccioned zeale towardes you, with an aſſured loyaltye euen vntyll thextreme diſſolucion of my naturall dayes, otherwayes yf he lyue in the tryumphe of my ſlaunder, what cauſe haue I to ioye in lyfe, or comfort to expoſe the beſt part in me, for the contentement & pleaſure of you, who ſtayeth to do me reaſon to ſo manifeſt a wronge.
            Here the young erle felte hymſelfe double paſſioned, whether he ſhoulde performe thexſpectacion of his venemous BASILA, whom he loued without meaſure, or abſteine from violacion of thinnocent blood of his frende, whome the lawe of frendſhypp forbad hym any waye to abuſe.

               ote of fauor of his miſtrys, beinge vpō his departure and retire to his lodging, was requeſted, to come in by one of her women, who opening the gate, conueighed him alone thorowe a faire gardeine into a large gallerie, honge on either ſide, with ſondrie ſortes of pictures and tables of loue and follie, where the counteſſe did not only giue hym greate thankes for the honour he dyd her with hys ſolemne muſycke, but alſo yelded hym ſuche other choice of familiar curteſye, that he ſeamed rather aſtonied with the preſence of the place he ſo muche deſyred, then hable to beſtowe anye thankes, or other ſymple ſhowe of dutie vppon hys newe gooddeſſe, who ſeynge hys ſymplicitie, thoughte yt was now time to ſtoppe the lewer vppon him, and giue him ſome aſſurance by wordes & effect, aſwell as ſhe had trained him ſo far by argumēts of outeward glée, wherfore taking him by the hand, ſhe led him to a lowe bedd

furniſhed with gréene ſatten, where (beinge ſet together) ſhe vſed this ſhorte order of collacion vnto hym.
            Albeit (ſyr) ye ſhow of my preſent curteſy may ſtur vp in you The coūteſſe to her laſt louer. ſome cauſe of ſyniſter ſuſpiciō, the rather, for that, hauinge no other knowledge, nor aſſurance of your honeſt behauior, then a ſimple reaport of your name and nobilitye, I haue gyuen you credit to enter my houſe, at ſo indecēt an hower, yet being in ſom part excuſed by the libertye of our contrey, which excedes the ſtrait inhibition of the Ladyes in Spaine and Scycylya, I am alſo to defeate all ſortes of imputation that waye, by the ſpeciall regarde of honor, I haue alwaies vſed on the behalf of ſtraungers, towardes whom, as I was neuer a nigarde of my liberalitye, ſpecially, when they do me that honor to viſitte my houſe, So for your parte, for that I fynde no cauſe aſyet eyther to diſclaime or diſcontinue my accuſtomed bountye from you, I am content to aſſure you no leſſe welcome, then any man that euer had acceſſ hether, with commiſſion, that the doare, beinge readye to bee opened at what hower ſo euer you knocke, you maye bee bolde to diſpoſe of me and myne no leſſe franklye, then yf the propertye of all that I haue reſted in your ſelfe: which enterteinement, as it was vnloked for of Seigneur Pierro, So the liberall offer of hys miſtres toke awaye the paſſion of his domme traunce, and not only reſtored hym againe to the libertye of his ſpeache, but alſo renforced hym wyth a new corage to put his requeſt vpon tearmes, and make a tender of his ſeruice, wyth proteſtation, that if ſhe woulde paſſe a graunt of her good will, and admitt hym for her ſecret ſeruant and frend, he would vſe ſuch indeuor to make declaration of the dutifull zeale he bare her, that ſhe ſhoulde fynde hym nothing inferior to any gentilman that euer made profeſſion of loue or other ſeruice to his Ladye, nor haue cauſe any way to miſlike her choiſe, for yt he wold neuer be ſo raſh in promiſe, as redie to expoſe an effect, nor ſhe ſo willyng to require, as he twyſe diligent to parforme thuttermoſt of her cōmaundements, ſhe felyng her ſelfe clawed in yt place that

ytched moſt, replyed with a ſmyling countenance, that ther perience of the often breache of promiſſe in ſuche as vſe to court vs ſimple Ladyes wyth the marchandiſe of loue, doth argue ſo much thincōſtancye of men, (ſaith ſhe) that for my part, if I ſawe a preſent effect of true loyaltye before myne eyes, yet could I hardlye he brought to repoſe eyther credit or aſſurance in any promiſe, ſeing men them ſelues nowe a dayes are infected wyth the ayre of ſuch fragility, that they neyther reſpect the honeſtye of their word, nor the vertue in parformyng the leaſt effect of a thouſand liberal offers they make at vnwares. Albeit as he yt chargeth the guyltles with the offence of the murderer, doth wrong to his innocencye, ſo I haue learned that it is a ſpeciall vertue to be perſiall in opinion toward ſtraūgers, and iudge the beſt of euery man. wherfore for your part (ſyr) if you will enlarge the offer of your fyrſt faith with this addicion, that I may be bold to imploye you in one ſpectall affaire of mine at ſuche time as I ſhall ſommon you therunto, I am content not onely to put you in poſſeſſion of your requeſt, But alſo to bynd my ſelfe to no leſſe loyaltye on your behalfe, then euer appeared in any Ladye to wards her faythful ſeruant. The captayne that would willyngly haue ſacrifiſed hym ſelfe for the raunſome of her fauor, ſtoode not to examine what charge ſhe would enioyne him vnto, but cōfirmed an aſſurance with ſundry ſorts of othes, being no leſſe raſhe in ye promiſe of euel, thē haſtie to performe thexecutiō, as herafter you ſhal heare. Here was brewed the broth or preparatyue of the fatall obſequies of her former loue, & the earneſt penny gyuē of the blodie bargayn & death of Seigneur Valpergo, for ſhe, by the too liberall & vnhoneſte vent of her honor, made him the Borreau & vnnatural executioner of noble blod, defacinge by ye ſame meanes the gentrie of his houſe, which he ought to haue preſerued til the laſt drop of blood in his body. And remaining there al that night, ſhe made him ſo pleaſant a bāquet of delicat kyſſes & other exerciſes of ye bed, that the more he taſted of ye pleaſure, the more he thruſted with deſyre to cōtinue ye ſport, & ye ſubtil

               Cirſes for her part, ſemed ſo vehemēt in loue, with diſſimuled arguments of vnfayned affection that in perſuading himſelfe of the victorye of her good wyl, he thought he had made a conqueſt of the whole eaſte parte of the worlde, ſeming ſo drowned in the deuocion of his new Sainte, & charmed with the enchauntmentes of her art, which (peraduenture lente her ſome power or aſſiſtance of legierdemain) to force his humor of earneſt zeale, that if ſhe had ſayd the worde, he had made no conſcience to haue committed the whole Citye of Myllan to the mercie of fyre and gunpowder, lyke as Blouſe de Cume, was redye to put fyer into all partes of the cytie of Rome, if the Sedicius Tyberyus Gracchus had geuen it hym in charge: ſuche is the rage and frantyke folye of youth, when they ſuffer their amarous tranſport to excede the caryr of reaſon or diſcreſſion, and from this fountayn haue diſtilled heretofore many deſtructions of Realmes with ſubuerciōs and alteracions of monarchies, wherin alſo may be noted a maruelous corrupt and vaine diſpoſicion in ſuch as wyl rather affect and haunte the companye of a publike curtyſan, then honor the vertue of a chaſt lady, although ſhe were his lawful wyfe and companion of bedd, and yet thoſe gallandes wyll not ſticke to Ieſte and point at the maried man, gouerned ſometime by the ſage aduice of his lawful wife, wher they ſeme readye at the commaundemente of a ſtrompet or arrand whoare, not only to hazarde the price of their honor, but alſo (in fauoring thinſtygaciō of her wickednes) to make their teſtament vpon a ſkafolde layinge their heades vnder the edge of the ſworde of Iuſtice, wherin I nede not torne ouer many bokes for copy of exāples, ſeing you may be ſufficiently ſatiſfyed wyth ye view of the folye of this baſtarde of Cardonne in performinge the ſuggeſtion and malice of this mordering cornteſſe, who ſeinge her captayne ſufficientlye framed to the poſtey of her wyll, thoughte it was now time to put him in remembrance of his promiſe, and ſomon him to the reuenge of them that thought no more of her cōſpiracyes nor traynes of treaſon, wherin as the howre approched

that her Laſciuious trade of life ſhoulde be enioyned to open pennance, and the wrong & violacion of faith to her huſbād, with her pernicious intentes & effectes of murders, receyue theire due hyre and puniſhment, and that the rage of deſtenie woulde not be appeaſed tyll ſom man weare committed to execution, ſo for a more expedicion of the fatall ende of her miſerable lyfe, ſhe entiſed her baſtard louer into a cloſe arbor in the gardin where only ye byrdes weare witnes of their diſcours, and brake with hym in this ſorte. Yf nature (Sir hath gyuen to euery one a ſpeciall care to holde the vſe of lyfe moſte deare with a peculyar deſyer to fauor the cours of our dayes wyth ſo lōg a tearme as we can, how much more are we bounde to embrace and be carefull of that whiche cauſeth vs to lyue wyth a ſinguler renome from amongſt the reſt of the baſer ſort of people, who lyenge alwaye in watch to marke oure order of lyuing, are no leſſe glad to haue an occaſion of ſlaunder, then redye to impart it to all the worlde, with ſuch percialitye of vnworthie bruit, yt the greater we ſeame in degrée, the more hainous they make our offence, and mortal fautes not only ſcarſe noted, but alſo tollerable in meaner perſonages, wherin as we women are moſt incident to the awe of that malicious clymat of people, both for that they Sift vs and our doings more narrolye thē the reſt, and becauſe we beinge the weaker companye, are not armed with ſufficient force to reſiſte their rage, ſo the indifferēt ſorte ought not to be raſhe in iudgement on their ſydes, nor gyue ſentence of diſcredit or diſhoneſty againſte vs, the rather by a ſiniſter ſuggeſtion of ſuche a vulgar and barbarous crewe, neyther ought we to ſpare or feare anye ſort of reuenge, whiche maye aduaunce the recouerye of that wherof we are wrongfully deueſted.
            Thus much I haue inferred (ſyr as a preamble to the requeſt I meane to make, which I take god to witneſſe procedes not to much of deſyer to purſue the reuenge of wrong I haue alredie receiued, as to make knowen to all the worlde, wyth what integritye I go about to preſerue the renome of my

former reputacion, knowinge ryght well that the earthe beareth nothing ſo precious or of ſo great value, that is hable to reſtore or make good the forfeiture of the honor of a la dye of equall Calibre and callinge to mee, And becauſe I wil not kepe you in long ſuſpence, nor with tedyous circum ſtance moue anye myſlike to hym that hath offered to Iuſtify my cauſe againſt them, whoſe wickednes haue procured theſe tearmes of iuſt complaynte, it may lyke you to vnderſtand, this, as not long ſins I remayned at PAVIA wyth a trayne conuenient for my degree, may ntaynynge court and hoſpitalitie in ſuche ſorte, that the greateſte eſtate ſeamed content wyth myneordynar ie, ſo amongeſt the reſt of the repayre and acceſſe to my houſe, I was vyſited wyth an often hawnt of two earles of equall nobylytie and ſemblable diſcent of honor, to whom albeit I vſed an indifferente countenaunce, expoſing no great argument of famylyaritie on their behalfes, then (as you ſe) I ſhow to euery gentlemā, yet forgetting theſtymacion of their owne race, and ranke which I hold, they haue ſemed of late ſo vnthankfull, to the honor I vſed towards them, that I fynd a returne of the meryt of my curteſye wyth a general brute of open ſlaunder, begon and contynued by them, who alſo ceaſe not as yet to endeuor to make my name no leſſe notoryous of Infamye, then if I weare the moſt cōmon curtiſan in Rome or Venyce wherin as the vertue of my Innocencye is hable to ſatiſfye thopynions of ſuch as know me, for that thintegretie of my life hethervnto parſwades them, that I am bothe belyed by malyce, and ſlaundred wythout cauſe, ſo al ſtraungers, and ſpecyallye the vulgar ſorte, conferringe my delycate and braue order of lyuinge, wyth the parnicious rumor of theſe gallandes, doughts not to confirme their vylaynes wyth an abſolute Iudgemēt, that I am no leſſe diſhoneſt in dede, then their brute hath publiſhed in euery corner and cuntrye of I talye, wherof beſydes yt myne owne conſcyence doth abſolue me, yet dare I pleade & appeale to the teſtymony of your

            This franke promiſſe with the liklyhode of ſpedye effecte,

breathed ſuche a freſhe ayre of conſolacion into the mordering counteſſe, that after ſhe had coolled and embraſed hym in a thouſande ſortes, with an offer and liberall dedication of her life, with all that ſhee had, even vntyll the laſte and extreme dropp of her blodde, tolde hym the names of her enemies, who ſaithe ſhe, are not hable to make good anye waye, the forfeiture of myne honour but by their deathe and perentorie deſtruction, wherewith he willed her eftſones to diſmiſſe all care, and reapoſe herſelfe vpon him, for ſaith he, afore thexpiraciō of many daies, you ſhal heare ſuch newes as you long for, wherin he failed neither of the tyme nor effect of his promiſe, for that the nexte night hee was aduertiſed by certeine eſpialls, which he had ſet for the purpoſe, that therle Valpergo, ſupped in the towne, wherfore he armed him ſelf with twentie menne at armes of his ſoldiours, and laye in ambuſhe of eyther ſide the ſtrete, where therle ſhould paſſe in his retorne to his lodgynge, who with his brother arme in arme, with ſome fyue or ſix of their pages and ſeruantes, betwene ten and eleuen of the clocke in the euenynge, came deuiſynge merely together till they were at the Iaumbe or torne of a ſtreete that ſtretcheth to ſainte Iacques, where ſoddainly they ſawe theym ſelues aſſailed and ſet vpon on all ſides with men in armor, and findynge their force far to weake to mainteine ſkirmiſh with ſo greate a trowpe armed at all pointes vpp to the throate, and they onely, the ſimple aſſiſtance of the rapior and cloke, began to flee, but they founde aſtopp of paſſage in euerye place, in ſuche ſorte, as therle and his brother, with the reſt of their ſmall crewe, were cutt in peces in one inſtante, albeit as morder is the ſynne moſte deteſtable affore God, ſo we ſee fewe or none eſcape vnpunyſhed, nor any done in ſuche ſecret but the maieſtye of the higheſte, reſerues a No morder eſcapeth vnpuniſhed meane to diſcouer it, for in the heate of this ſharpe medley, therle ARDIZZYNO eſpied the baſterde PIERRO, whome he named and called vppon manye tymes, but all in vaine,

whiche beyng harde and aduouched by one of the towneſmen, ſtandyng rather in his windowe to crye ayme, then helping any waye to parte the fraye, was the cauſe that he was taken the ſame nighte, and committed to priſon, by thautoritie of the duke of BVRBON lieutenante and chyefe gouernour within MILLAN for themperour Charles the fyfte, and the nexte daye fearynge the offer of the racke or other tormentes, he confeſſed the facte, wyth the cauſe to procede of the ſiniſter ſubornation of the Counteſſe Blanche Marie, whoſe lyfe and trade, accordyng to the diſcourſe you haue alredy harde, he ymparted at large, to the DVKE and reſte of the councell, ſhe beynge aduertiſed of the whole, had tyme and libertie to flee, but god whyche is iuſte, would not that her wickednes ſhoulde bée aſſiſted with anye longer date, ſeynge that if ſhe had liued, her malice, woulde alſo haue raged vppon therle GAIAZO, who by good chaunce was at that tyme out of the towne.
            The nexte daye ſhée was ſente into an other priſon in the towne, to auoyde conference betwene Dom Pierro and her, whereof there was more cauſe of feare then néeded, for that vppon the firſte examination, ſhe confeſſed the whole conſpiracie, truſtynge belyke, in, I can not tell howe manye her thouſande crownes, where with ſhée hoped to corrupte the gouernour or ſuche as bare authoritie vnder him, wherin her exſpectation, was no leſſe fruſtrate, then her deſtinies ſeamed wearie to fauour her with longer lyfe, for the offer of her crownes was hatefull to the vpryghte miniſters of inſtice, and other meanes of medyacion hadde no place in the ſenate, for that ſhe was iudged to bée taken oute of priſon, the ſeconde daye after the morder, and loaſe her head in the place of publicke execution, in the meane while, the capteines of the armye, purchaſſed the lyfe of the baſtarde of CARDONO, and ſente hym with diuers letters of comendacion to themperour, who for the reſpecte of hys experience and practis in warre, aduaunced him to a charge

conueniente for his ſkil.
            And albeit the laſte arreſte and ſentence diffinitiue of the miſerable counteſſe, was communicated vnto her, to thende ſhe mighte put her ſelfe in readines to paſſe the dreadfull iourney of deathe, yet ſeamynge to repoſe muche for her ſelfe in th'aſſiſtance of her coffers, ſhe neyther diſmayed at the newes, nor diſpoſed her ſelf any waye toward God, vntill the ſergeantes criminall, taking her out of her dongeon in the caſtell, led her to the fatall theatrie in the market place where was erected a faire ſkaffolde, to playe the laſte acte of her tragedye vppon, there ye wretched Ladye entred into open confeſſion of her faltes and former lyfe in the hearyng of the multitude, deſiring God vpon her knées wyth greate effuſion of teares, not to deale with her according to her deſerts, but that ſhe mought enioye the benefytt of his mercye, and that he woulde not argue agaynſte her, for yf he iudged her accordinge to her iniquities, ſhée was not hable to abyde it, and ſo deſyering the people to preferr their prayers on her behalf, for her better aſſiſtance of ye ſpirit of grace in her perillous paſſage which ſhe had to parforme, ſhe renounſed nature by the deadly blow of the ſword of execution whiche toke awaye the head from the parnicious bodie of her, who in her life neuer founde any wickednes whyche ſhee dyd not onelye ymbrace, but excede wyth ymitation, and increaſe with further vylanye, nor was acquaynted with any vertue, whyche ſhe dyd not abuſe, or conuert into an agrauacion of ſynne: a goodlye example ſuer, for the youth in oure tyme, ſeynge that the greateſt parte launſynge indifferentlye into the gulphe of all abhominacion, are gouerned onelye by the tranſport of their vaine & foolyſh conceits, without hauing reſpect to the ſūdry, miſchefes & impoſitions of ſhame which fayle not to attend the end of ſuche exerciſes, for yf the Lord of Cardonne hadd not bene reſcowed by th'aſſiſtance of a good fortune, and taken

out of the handes of diſtreſſe by ſpeciall ayde of thother Captaynes, it may be eaſely iudged what miſerie had thundered vpon him by geuinge himſelfe in praye to the flatteringe appetit of a lighte and fooliſhe woman, who ſeamed to yelde him more glée or fauor, for the ſatiſfieng of her own luſt, and to performe her malicious deuiſe, then for any reſpect of loyaltye or true loue, Indiferent care of his honor, or honeſt regard to her own eſtimation, and trewlye as hys miſfortune is great, that beſtoweth his affectiō vpō a whore, for that he is incident to a thouſande inconueniences: So his folye is no leſſe, that perſwades himſelfe to be beloued of a common doxie, ſeinge their amytie continueth no longer then they reape eyther pleaſure or profit, neyther are they ſo inconſtant in loue, as voyde of meaſure in Imaginacion of miſchiefes, wherin for that our plentiful time yeldes vs choyſe of examples and ſorte of familyar experience, I am content to abridge the Iuſtification at this tyme, for that to maintain continuall argument of morders or affaires full of peril, is often hurtful to the quyet mynde, deſiring ſomtime a pleaſant recreacion from affliction, no leſſe then the pylot or weary mariner couets a preſent calme and appeaſement of angrye EOLE after they haue bene longe forwearyed in contending againſt the malice of their fortune amonge the perillous ſtrayghts of thunquiet occean.
            And albeit the corruption of our owne nature is ſo great, that we take more delight to heare a diſcours or beadroll of folyes, then in reportes enterlarded with admonicions full of reaſon and wyſedom, yet am I perſwaded, that ſuche as haue their mindes typped wyth vertue, cānot be ſo perua

               , nor voyde of good diſpoſition, as the other wretches, whoſe lyues bearynge the badge of infamie, makes theim alſo ſequeſtrated from the reſte of the good ſort, wherin we ought to be fullye reſolued, that there is no Hyſtorie, (howe full of pleaſant delyte ſo euer it appeare) which yeldes not with all, wholſomme Inſtructions to dyrecte oure lyues, neyneyther

ought we to be ſoſcrupulous or ful of curioſitie As eyther to condemne or miſlike the pleaſaunt comodye for that it is not painted with ye ſerenety of the Stoickes, ſeing the volumes of prophaned records, & ſcripture it ſelf do note vnto vs the lyues of ſundre vicious parſons, not for that we ſhoulde enter into tearmes of grudge againſte the reaport of ſuche auncient antiquitie, nor diſpoſe our ſelues to the imitation of the like vices, but rather in vewynge the ſtrange and greuous puniſhment whiche ordinarily hath ouerwhelmed ſuche ſin, to learne and labor to directe our lyues by the contrary of their examples, whiche is one reſpecte that made me put my penne in exerciſe to prefer this hiſtorie to our vulgar tonge, to thend alſo that the frayle youth of our countrie, that folowe the damnable path of iniquitie, maye ſée howe ſewer they are to féele the heauye hand of God, who bleſſeth the good ſorte wyth a plentyfull gyft of his grace, and puniſheth the wycked with ſundrye ſortes of affliction.

               The argument
               
                  WE ſholde not neede ſo muche thaſſiſtance of foreine recordes, nor reporte of aunciente hiſtories excedinge the compaſe of our age and memorie, if we were as carefull to note thaccydentes of our own time, as we ſeame curious in admiracion of rare things whoſe glorious antiquitie with parcialitie of fame, ſettes a more price of thindeuor of others, thē their diligence & doings deſerue by iuſtice, like as the grekes and romans painting with an exquiſitedexteritie of ye pen, their pollicy in warr, the valiantnes of their Captaines, their wonderfull fortune and good ſucceſſe in all enterpriſes, with other diſcourſes of their vertues, do argue them more glorious in their owne acts, then meritorious in deade of true commendacion, for that in arrogatinge vnto themſelues the only title and name of all knowledge, they make our time ſeme naked of all vertue, ſauinge ſuch as is deriued from theim and ymytacion of their doings. Albeit we maye obiect with the ſpartayne agaynſte thathenians, that thoſe lippwiſe ſoldiours or ſcoole orators, had a more facilitie in diſcouering, then facylitie in execucion of noble effects: not for that I meane to do ſuch wrong to their eſtimacion, as not to yelde to theim a title of ſingularitie in all perfections, yet I may alſo be bould to preferr the benefit of oure time which participating wyth their golden age in any reſpect of honeſt gift or qualitie, is hable to preſēt a furniture of as many examples and authorities of vertue as we rede were found in the politike ſtate of Rome when Cato, Camilla, or Scipio, gouerned that proude Citye, or when on Pericles, Themiſtocles or Ariſtides bare authoritie in the

worme of neceſſitie haue power to induſe them to do ye thing that their honor and honeſtie cānot iuſtify, they wil not ſtick to reſigne the hard and extreme condiciō of their ſtate into ye hands of the miſerable world by ſom glorious death, whych is the only and chief repoſe of myſery, and vndoubted conſolaciō of ſuch, as are alwayes perſecuted wt ye malice of aduer ſitie, wherof you may note a famyliar proofe in the ſequele of this Iulya who (notwithſtanding the pouertie of her parentes) had won by her owne induſtrie ſuch a general commendaciō of good gouernment and chaſte conuerſacion of lyfe, that excedinge therin all the reſt that were but her matches in equalitie of birthe and calling, ſhe brought alſo a decoracion of ſtate and encreaſe of glory to the obſcure name and pettegre of her poore aunceſtors, neither was ſhee of leſſe fame for the prayſe of her bewtie and ſemely ſhape of body, wherin nature ſemed to aduance her wyth ſuch aſſiſtance of her comming, that ſhe appered amongeſt the reſt of her companions, as the glorious roſe in the fragrant and pleaſante morning of may: ſhe had alſo ſuch a ſpeciall gyfte and order in ſpekinge, with a ſtaied countenance duringe her conference with any, together wyth a wonderful grace in geuing to euerye one the due reuerence of his callinge, that notwythſtandyuge the ſimplicitie of her houſe, wyth the ſmall aſſiſtance of diſcrecion, not yet confirmed wyth the nomber of xvi. yeres, her womanly and wyſe order, mighte ſerue to inſtruct ſome Ladyes of highe callynge, and make bluſhe a nomber of greate dames, that accompte theymſelues withoute compariſon in dyuerſe courtes in Italy and els where, Albeit as all theſe vertues and rare gyftes, ſerued rather to encreaſe her prayſe and commendacion among the people, then anye ſuer meane to ſupplye the pouertie of her parentes, or releue the hardenes of her owne ſtate, ſoo her father forgate not to imploye her in the trade of honeſte toyle, and teache her to treade the ſteppes of hys trauayle, ſometyme framynge her to the vſe

place of publicke aſſemblie, wher being vnhappely ſpied of a deteſtable palliard & common enemy of the honor of women, was ſodenly ſōmoned by the ſentence of her deſtines, & fell by no leſſe miſfortune, into ye dāger of a fleſhly louer, for at ye ſame inſtant, the noble Loys gonſaga thē byſhop of the douchy of Mantua, kept his reſidence at Gazolo, where amongeſt hys traine of houſhold gentlemen ther was one, who ſeruyng the byſhop in the office of a vallet of his chamber, hadd bene no leſſe worthye of the credite of that rowmthe, then of greter preferment at the hāds of his maiſter, if he had not byn vnhappely encoūtered by the deſaſter which this hiſtory pre ſēts vnto you: but what? a ſmall ſpot ſtaines a faier garmēt, and one vice that is deteſtable darkneth the credit of a nōber of vertues, it is to be noted (as I haue ſaid) yt in Italye ye méeting of youth & daunſing is tollerable, ſo it be in the viewe & eye of the people, but whatſoeuer other men do thincke of ye art of daunſing, I am perſwaded that it is rather a diſcipline deuiſed within the ſcoole of Sathan, then an exercyſe mete to encourage youth to thimitaciō of vertue wherin I appeale to iuſtifie my opinion, to the frute & effectes appearing daily in that laſciuius trade, & leuing a parte the inuectiues and infinite examples which the hiſtories on both partes do infer in deteſtacion of that wantō allurment or prouocation to ſin, I thought it ſufficiēt to confirme my aduiſe only wt the authoritie of the Romaine, who diſwading al men from the exerciſe of daunſing, ſaith that the countenaunce, geſtes and other behauyors of a daunſer, do nothinge differ from the order & diſpoſicion of a foole: here this valet of chaūber to ye byſhop, being vnhappelie preſēt in an aſſēbly of youth, eſpied by the like milfortune, the order & behauior of Iulia, who albeit, ſhe was ye poreſt of the cōpanie, yet was ſhe nothing inferior to ye beſt in ſemely grace and womanly order appearing in her during ye time of the daunce, which infectyng alredy the eies of the gallād of FERRARA, moued him alſo wt preſent deſier to go nere & take a better view of her beautie, which he was not hable to cōſider wt ſuch iudgmēt & aſſured ſtay of him ſelf

but the glymering complexion of her face dyed wt a natural coolor of white and red, made ſuche a breache into his harte, that wearing the picture of her beautie in the botome of the ſame, proclaimed her, without further aduiſe, yt ſoueraygne Lady of hys lyfe, and only myſters and ruler of hys thoughtes, and aduowing herewt to yeald her the whole honor of his ſeruice, proteſted in ſecrett to himſelfe, with lyke vowe and ceremonye of vayne conceyte, not to leue the purſute of ſuche a praye, till he had made a conqueſt of that he ymagined, and encountred theffect of his deſyre, by wearyng the garland of the flower and firſte frutes of the maidenhedd of IVLYA, whom becauſe he ſtode on thornes til he had preſented the firſte erneſt penie of his ſeruice, he requeſted too daunce, whyche not knowynge the cauſe of hys courteſye, ſhe refuſed not to doe, as one no leſſe redy too performe all requeſts and affayres of cyuilitie and good bringing vp, accordynge to her callynge, then excellyng all the reſte of her tyme in beautie and other vertues without exception, but yf this fonde younglynge and pupill of CVPIDO dyd féele afore, the ſymple mocions of loue, beginnyng too tickle him but with deſyre onelye to vewe her at large, yt is nowe that he reſygned hymſelfe wholy into the daunger of hym who as a ſubtill ſerpent, lyeth in wayte to inuade them Loue. whome he fyndes vnarmed with vertue, laughynge afterwarde to hym ſelfe at oure redynes to lyſten to the lure of hys bayte, and ronne hedlonge into the laborynthe of endles dyſquyet, and that whyche brought more oyle to hys matche, and kyndled in hys harte the preſent ſparkes of hoat affection, was, when he felt the tendernes of her hande, whiche albeit was euery daye dipped in dyuers vnholſom confections, and alwayes bare, tabide the violence of the wether, not refrayninge the hardnes or hard labour of any toyle, reteyned ſuche a dilicate ſoftnes and naturall hewe of it ſelfe, that it ſeamed equall (for the fynes & ſmothnes of ſkyn) to ſome Ladyes which I know) are aſſiſted with the helpe of waters and lée made for the nonce, and other

legerdemeins deuiſed by the potticarye, to preſerue their handes, in a continual moyſture with a fyne whyte & pleaſant ſhow The pleſant reflection of her ladylike hand, which durynge the daunce he fayled not too graſpe as often as hée durſt, gaue ſuche encreſe to the warre alredy begon, renewinge the combate of his thoughtes with ſuche freſh ſupplies of affection, that he found himſelfe ſo much to weake to menteine warr with one of the greteſt lordes of the world, that geuing place to his preſent fortune, he reſigned the fortreſſe of his former quiet, and became priſoner to him, who wolde not be content with any other ranſome, then the loſſe of his libertie duringe his pleſure: and albeit the poore gentleman (felinge to great an extremytie in this firſt paſſion) woulde gladly haue reſigned his preferment & not purſewed the ſequele or folowe the chaſe, yet whether it were ye ſmale experience he had in the ſkole of loue, or the angrye dome of hys deſtinies, that wolde not diſmiſſe him without the rewarde of his follie, or whether the foggy myſte of founde affection, hadd ſo ſéeled the eyes of his mynde, that he ſawe hymſelfe, denied the aſſiſtance of any meane to redeme him from the yoke of his newe bondage, or what yt was, the ſequele of his yll fortune, maye argue ſufficiently hys follie, but wel I knowe, that for a diſeaſe of ſo ſtraunge diſpoſicion, he lacked his neceſſarye medycine, beyng no leſſe deceyued in the credite of his owne wytt, in ſekynge to quenche and mortifie the fyre alredy burſt out into flame, by geuinge ſkope to hys eye, to féede contynually vppon her, whom he knowes to bée the cauſe of his grefe, neyther dyd he other good to him ſelfe then caſte water vppon hoat coales, dobling the rage of hys affection, by the deſire he had to be contynually in her companye, he ought rather to haue abandoned the place with the preſence of his enemye at the very firſt alaram and offer of thaſſault, diſmiſſinge the remembrance of her beautie affore it made any breach in his harte, for he that is vnhappely fallen into the danger of loue, muſt not kepe war with the remembrance of her, that hath enchaunted him, nor pur

ſewe the viewe of her beautye with a continuall gaze or regard of his eye, but rather eſchewing the place & preſence of his myſtris (two cōmon enemies to his quiet) ſeke to ſubdue the rage of his paſſion with longe abſence and far diſtance of his aboad, wherein he muſte ſeme ſo preciſe to cure ſo ſtrange a diſeaſe, that yf vnhappely he come within the aier of the place wher ſhe is, he ſtand ſo ſuerly vpon his guarde, that ſhe once glaunce not vpon him with a glimeryng ſommonce of her flattteringe eye, conſideryng that in the verey eye and looke of a woman, doth lurke an infection of ſuche drawyng vertue, that one ſimple obiect or glance of ye ſame, being ſufficient to pearce thorowe ye armour of his reſiſtāce, is alſo hable to bringe him efteſones vnder the yoke of her awe, But this fooliſh Ferrarois rather reſolued in his euil, and contented with his choiſe, then deſierous to retire in time, or hable (as it ſemed) to ſhōne the peril of ye loſſe of his libertye, gaue place to his preſent fortune, & entred the liſtes, as thrall or captiue to the beauty of Iulya, with whō after thend of ii. or iij. daunces, he began to deuiſe & diſcourſe of loue in this ſorte: yf the record of diuerſe hiſtories of old time, together The gētlemā maketh loue to Iulya. wt the preſent viewe of ſondry familiar exāples at this daie, did not ſo amply deſcribe the power of loue, & partly inſtructe me touching his order & diſpoſition. I ſholde ſeme no leſſe amaſed at the miſtery of his traūce, then I feele my ſelf vnhappely encountred with the meſſenger of his beheſt, and iuſtely (me thincke) may we commence complaint againſt nature, who framing vs of a brickel & delicat mettall, made vs rather incident & apte to incur euery danger of the fleſhe & peril of temptaciō, then armed vs with choiſe of meanes to reſiſte the ordinary aſſaultes of the world, wherof (ſaieth he) I may exclaime wyth good aucthoritie aboue the reſt, ſeinge that ſince ye viewe of your preſence in this place I am fallen into the prooffe of the like perill: for as I haue hetherto enioyed the benefit of a moſte pleaſant libertye, beinge no leſſe froo from all aſſaults of fond affection, then voide to deſier to commend my ſeruice to the beſt Lady of them all, So ſynce

my gredye and vnhappye eyes ſeaſed with ſuche aſſurance vpon your beautye, takynge with large viewe, the ful meaſure of al your parts, & making preſent report therof to my hart & other the inward parts of me, I haue ſuſteined ſuche hoate alarams betwene my libertie & deſyer to do you ſeruice, that beinge no lenger hable to reſtore the feighte for want of freſh ſupplies, am here cōme vnder your lée, preſenting my ſelfe the priſoner of your beautie, wherin albeit, I can not by any merite of mine owne, craue an expedicion of fauour by iuſtice, yet do I not diſpaier that you will ſuſpend my deliuery, ſeing my paſſion is of no leſſe importāce then either thabridgemēt or prolōging of my lif, perſuading my ſelf with this ſpecial comfort, that vnder the vaile of ſo rare a beautie, ther can not lurke any diſpoſiciō of lōg crueltie: but ſhe deteſting no leſſ his pepered perſuacions, then loathinge to ſpend longe time in ſo vaine an argument, replied no leſſe wyſelye then with tearmes of vertue, meaſuring her anſwer with the ſhortnes of tyme ſhe ment to deuiſe wyth him: it is hard ſyr (ſaith ſhe) to iudge a difference Iulya anſvvereth. betwene your vnſemelye diſcurteſye, and the argument of your preſent follye, ſeinge both the one and the other importe a ſemblable meaning of diſhoneſtye, neyther are they bothe voide of equall reproche to your owne eſtimacion.

But, to retorne now to our hiſtorie, this ympp

            And now as this bloddie Lady, had in this ſort, diſcharged (as ſhe thought) euery doubt and feare hereafter, chiefly for that ſhe ſtoode no more in awe of any Cenſor or ſpie to kepe a kalender of her faltes, wherby ſhe vſed leſſe care in the conueigh of her beaſtly traffique wyth her viperus aduocat: So not wythſtanding her ſeconde ſonne, grudginge ſtill in the deathe of hys brother, and ſome what doubtful of the cauſe, began to be Ieleouſe in the pointes of his miſlike, and beinge of equal corage to his brother, and of no leſſe nobilitye in hart, cold not alſo diſgeſt the view of diſhonour, ſpecially in the higheſt degree of hys houſe and affynitie, whereof he

            What was now the refuge of this Ladie, diſtreſſed on euery ſide, if not to retire into teares, dropping with ſtreames of preſent ſorow, in the remembrāce of her former crueltie▪ ah Zylpa ſorovveth her for mer crueltie. vnhappye and thryſwretched Ladye that I am (ſaith ſhe) broughte to due deſolacion and puniſhment by ſhame for an effecte of crueltie excedinge the barbarous diſpoſicion of the Lurke or Moare, or other infidell withoute religion or faith: in ſéekinge alas to deceiue an other, I am fallen into the daunger appointed to giue ende to my lyfe? Was it not ſufficient for me to be warned of the reuenge of mine enemye, by myne owne rigour vſed towardes hym, but that I

muſte attempte his curteſie, and willinglie fal into the malice of hym, who, triumphinge in the ſpoiles of mine honor, gothe about alſo to take from me my lyfe, & mortifye my renowme Honeſtie the chiefeſt ſupport of lyfe. for euer? Why fel I not alas into the Iawes of ſom wilde beaſte in paſſing the alpes, or threw my ſelfe hedlong from the topp of ſome craggie mountaine, whereby I ſhold haue preuented the ſtroake of his malice, who ſéekes to make me a wounder to the multitude, for attemptinge a thinge, which reſtes whollie at the wil and pleaſure of him, whom I had ſo haynouſly offended. Ah Seigneur Virley, howe can you beſtowe ſuche colde conſideracion, on the pleaſures wherein I haue bene ſo liberall on youre behalfe? or what moueth theſe regardes of diſdaine, with deſyer to haue the lyfe of her, who if euer ſhe offended, hath alredie performed the pennaunce of her falte? and what offence is ſo greate, whiche is not ſatiſfyed, with amendes for the treſpas? which if I haue not alreadye aunſwered, let my teares make good the reſte of your rigorous ſentence? Imagin Seigneur Virley. What a vertue it is to forgiue, where the extremetye of reuenge is the fowleſt vice that occupieth the harte of man. And for your parte, as you haue made your ſelfe knowen to the worlde, by your continuall felicitie in all your affaires, ſo ſticke not to make an encreaſe of your glorye by preuentynge the perill of her, who lyinge proſtrate afore your knées, bathinge the ſame in the ſooddes of her ſorowfull teares, dothe alſo kyſſe your feet, in ſigne of repentance of her former follye? Ah lett me not dye for my ſimplicitye, nor min honor put to ſacrifiſe, as a reuenge of the litle wronge, whiche I confeſſe my chaſtetie hath don you: take not alas ſo cruell vengeance vppon ſo ſmall an offence, neyther ſuffer the blodd of my life to quenche the thurſt of your malice, that haue alredie payed treble tribute, in reſpect of my falte, wherewith (meanynge yet to continue in tearmes of complaint) the ſergeaunt Cryminall (wyth authoritie from the Kyng) areſted her to priſon, whether ſhe wente with ſmall conſtraint, as wearye alredye with the view of her preſent

miſerye and loathynge the vſe of longer lyfe, hauynge loſte the chiefe ſupport of the ſame. But the knighte pinched with ſome remorſe touchinge the paſſion of his deare Zilya, thinkynge her ſufficiently puniſhed for ſo ſmall offence, wente immediatly to the kynge, to whome, in the hearing of his Lordes, he makes diſcourſe of his loue paſſed, the crueltie of Zilya in bindynge hym to a vowe of ſcilence for iij. yeres, and the preſent reuenge he hath taken of her diſcurteſye, wyth humble requeſt in the ende, to moderat the rigour of his iuſtice, both to her, and others that were in priſon for his recouerye, ſeing (ſaith he) the ſame depended either vppon her that bounde me to that charge, or els vppon thaſſiſtance of time, which at laſt woulde haue diſſolued my dome fraunce, by thaccompliſhment of the thinge whiche my fayth bounde me to performe.
            The kynge merueiled not alitle to heare ſo ſtraunge a hiſtorye, reioyſyng notwithſtandynge in the happie retourne of his ſpeche, and giuing ſingler commendacion to the loyaltye of his knighte, condemned preſentlye the crueltie and couetouſnes of the widowe, vppon whome hadd folowed execution accordinglye, yf it had not béene preuented by the ſpeciall interceſſion of Seigneur Virley, who takynge her out of priſon, accompanied her certeine dayes iourney, aſwell to ſhowe her the kynges liberalitye in diuerſe townes and holdes, whiche he had beſtowed vppon hym, as alſo to ſatiſfye his appetitt at the full, with the frutes, whereof he had fealte earſte ſo pleaſant a taſte: wherewith alſo ſhe dyd not muche miſlike, for that the prooff of ſuche fauor vnlooked for, tooke awaye the payne of her late impriſonement iuſtelye deſerued, beſides, her late diſpair of life, made her doble thankeful to the author of her libertie, which ſhe embraſed with more cōtentemēt, then when ſhe knewe not what it was to loaſe the pleaſant taſte of frée lyfe, wherein maye be noted an experience of the dealing of fortune, who kepes in ſtoare, like puniſhment for all

be bold to aduouche his power to preauile in things which ſeame of ympoſſibilitie to thother paſſions that be common vnto vs, for what thinge can be of greater force in a man, then that, which conſtrainynge an alteracion of cuſtome, and breach of that which by contynuance hath taken rote within vs, doth make (as it were) A new body, and the mynd a meare ſtraunger to her former cogitacions, which I neither inferr without cauſe, nor menteyne this argument without great reaſō, for that as of al the vices which ſpot the lif of mā, ther is none (except ye excecrable ſyn of whoredom) which makes vs ſoner forget god & good order then the deteſtable exerciſe of vnlawful game, neither are we ſo hardly reclaymed frō any thing, as that cutthrote delite, for that it is almoſt as poſſible to conuert the crueltie of a ſhe wolffe or lyones into a preſent mekenes, as to mortefie the deſier of plaie in him, which hath bene norriſhed and nozelled therin frō the beginning of his yeres: Euen ſo notwithſtanding the force of loue, wrought ſuch a miſterie in an vnthriſt of Naples, that of the mo ſte prodigall and ryotous ſpendor that hath bene noted in any age, hee made a moſt ſtaide and ſparing gentlemā that Italy hath brought furth of many yeres, ſince or afore his time, Albeit euen vpon the point and beginning of his new fondacion, beinge redie wt all to expoſe frutes of his happye chang frome euill to good trade, he was encowntred wyth the malice of his deſtinies, which abridged hys felicytie and life in one moment, wherof you maye diſcerne a manifeſte profe in the ſequeile of the hiſtorie folowing.

And as one poyſon driueth oute an other, and no one vice that is not ſubiecte to the correctiō of an other falte, ſoo by that inuincible ympreſſion whyche the Poetes haue painted in the ſhape of a blynde boye properly called loue, this gamſter was not onely forced to a ſpedye chaunge and alteracion of lyfe, but alſo after ſondrie and ſharpe ſhowers of aduerſatie, reſtored to his auncient entyer and place of

honour and eſtimacion: for at the ſame inſtante within Naples, ſoiorned a riche merchante bleſſed at goddes handes chiefly with a faire and vertuous doughter called Carmoſyna, whoſe only beautie made more breaches into the harte of Antonio Perrillo then the graue admonicions of thelders or any other of his frendes, and albeit he was (as it were) ſoo bewitched and drowned in the deuocion of playe, that all tymes ſeamed hatefull, whyche broughte hym not freſh ſupplies of gamſters, yet hauynge once glaunced vppon the gliſteringe eyes of this younge girle, he coulde not ſo well gouerne his encounter, that not onely the deſier of that ydle exerciſe was cleane mortefyed in hym, but alſo he ſuffred hym ſelfe imediatly to be enrolled in the booke of loyall louers, in ſuche ſorte as he neuer delited ſo much in any plaie at the diſe, as nowe he doateth vppon the beautie of Carmoſinae, who for her parte, notynge ſondrie entiſynge glées, whyche nature had lente to the younge man, together with his bowntefull diſpocition, with braue attyre and courtlyke wearing his apparell, whyche as it is one chyef allurement that ſomons yt affection of a woman at this day, ſo the found woman wil rather delite in his ſmal waſte, and exterior pro porcion, then ymbraſe the vertue and giftes of cōmendacion in a man, thoughte it an effect of equal courteſie, to retorne his affection with ſemblable loue, wherefore yf he ſelte any tormente, her paſſion was nothynge inferior, whiche alſo grewe to tearmes of doble gréefe on bothe partes, for that they durſt neither vſe ytcredit of any meſſinger to diſcouer their darke meanynge, and muche leſſe were they aſſyſted with meanes of conference or acceſſe together, for that the maides thear are bownde to a more ſtrayte talke of libertie, then in our countree, but for thoppynion of their chaſtetie I leaue it to the iudgment of them that haue had indifferent experience of bothe the places. But Perillo, as moſte hottly aſſailed, and leaſte hable to reſiſte thalaram, and felynge a taſte of that whereof he was ignoraunte in thoperation, & doubting altogether of thaccidēt til nature made him vnderſtand

the miſtery, entered into his laborinth of endles annoye, rauynge and raginge with hollowe dreames, with doubte which of his wittes he mighte moſte boldly employe in bewraieng his vehemente affection to the newe miſtrys of his harte, of whoſe good will, if he had but a ſymple aſſurance by the breath of her owne mouth, he ſeamed not to doubte any waye the conſente of her, for that thinequalitie of degrée and honor, reſted on his ſide, perſwadyng withal that the merchant wolde willingly admit thallyaunce becauſe the mariage wold bringe a medley of honour vnto the baſe and darke complexion of his howſe. But in this accōpt he forgatt the chiefeſt charge, and that which at this daye is moſt reſpected in makinge of mariages, I meane wealthe & poſſeſſions, whereof Perillo had alreadie made marchandiſe & exchanged the moſte of that whiche was his, for a ſimple remembraunce of vaine delites paſſed, neyther did he conſider Riches moſt reſpected in mariages novv a dayes. the condicion of his preſente ſtate, with diminucion of his aunciente fame & honeſtie by a general brute of his vnthriſtie life, all which notwithſtandinge, loue forced hym to trie the forde, and ſounde the harte of the faire Carmoſyna, aſſiſting him alſo with a meane to haue thacquaintance of an old matrone, her outwarde gouerneſſe and inwarde credit of harte, whom he dandled with ſuche peppered perſwacions, and infections of certeine crownes, fallynge willingly into her pockett, that ſhe gaue aſſuraunce of her helpe to thuttermoſt, both in folowing and ſolicityng the matter, yf it were once ſett a broch by hym ſelfe, whiche he performed by her the next daye in a letter of this or like effecte.

            The operacion of this aunſwer ſeamed of ſuche force, in the hart of Antonio, that he ymagined he embraſed at thinſtante the faire Carmoſna, perſwading alredie a reſolute conſomacion of the bargaine by old Minio her father, to whō with more haſt then good ſpede, he declareth the next morninge, the honor and honeſt loue he bare to his doughter, with deſier that

            Thies laſte wordes and aunſwere not loked for of tholde marchant, broughte no ſmall perplexitie to our pore Perillo, who by the vehemencye of his paſſion, was forced to abandon the place and retire to his lodginge, where, with tunes of greate dollour he entered into a ſuruoye or viewe of his former lyfe in this ſorte.

I woulde myne eyes bad béene ſéeled, and handes tormented with the quyueryng palſey, when firſte I learned the ſubtilities and ſleigtes of cardes and diſe. I wiſhe I had bene bound to a taſke of painefull toile without releace from trauell, when firſte I gaue comiſſion to that idle trade, to ſupplante all deſier and neceſſary care in preſeruinge ye entire of my fathers remaine? howe vnhappie was I alas to kicke at the councell of ſuch, as reprehendyng my follies, preferred an affectioned care of my commoditie? why was I ſo vnthankefull to their zeale, and vnwillinge to follow their aduiſe? yf I had put a brydel to my pleaſure, I had eſchewed this hard penance of my vnthriftie youthe, which nowe I fynde (alas to late) to ſtande moſte nede of the admonicions of ryper age, Ab I wolde I had ſooner Sipped of the cup of loue, to the ende, that being broughte to the knowledge of that whereof I fynde to late an experience, I myghte haue preſerued the greateſt parte of that which I haue alredie loſte, but what? ſhall my deſaſter paſſed, take awaie the hope of a future fortune, or mortefie all expectacion of thaſſiſtance of a better tyme? or is it a vertue to diſpaire in diſtreſſe? no, lett rather the view of my diſorder paſſed put me in remembrance to retire to a newe gouernement and trade of lyfe, in ſuche ſorte, as with an honeſte indeuour to make ſtore of that whiche is leſte, and

reclaime the reſte that is gone, I maye giue abſolute argument to the worlde of a chaunge and amendment of lyfe, which alſo may cōuert the hardnes of the harte of Minyo into a diſpoſicion and deſyer to confirme the honeſt league which I craue at his handes, where vpon he put ſuche expedicion to his newe deuiſe, that in one inſtante, renouncynge euery pointe and circumſtance of his former life, he was tranſformed from the forme and inclinacion of a ſeconde Acolaſtus into the ſhapp of a ſparinge marchant, wherewith takynge thaduiſe of ſome of his frendes, who alſo aſſiſted his honeſte indeuor with ſome porcion of money, he conuerted the ſmal remeinder of his inheritaūce, into ſome thrée or foure thouſande crownes (with an intente to beare an aduenture with certeine marchantes that were vpon the pointe to furniſh a voyage from Leuant to Alexandria, a Citie in Egypte builded by the greate Alexander, being at this daye thonly trade of the Eaſte partes, for all ſortes of ſpices and other marchandiſe of greate value, and from whence (for the moſte parte) the Venetians, Genoeys, Florentins and other countreyes of Italye keping their banke and ſtore houſes there, doo furniſhe all Europe with ſuch kinde of neceſſarie traffique.
            The infortunat Perillo conuerted wholly (as you ſée) into a marchante venteror, with no leſſe deſyer to reſtore his wealth, with the gaine of his preſent trade, then earſte he had delite to conſume all in idle exerciſe, committes his porcion to his fortune, and amongeſt the reſte of the aduenturers, hoyſſeth ſaile in hope of better ſpede then it was his chaunce to encoūter, for they were not fyftye leagues vpon the mayne Sea, when they were ſharpelye aſſailed by an angry Neptune, who miſlikynge theyr voyage, ſett a broche the malice of the windes, forcynge the Sea to ſo hyghe a billatt and vnruly rage of the waues, that thimpetuoſitie of the tempeſte, toke awaye the force of the pylottes and maryners in ſuche ſorte, as beinge no longer hable to reſiſte the furye of the ſtorme committed theim ſelues and ſhipp to the mercye of the waues,

            But fortune, who had yet an other acte of tragical malice to preſente vnto thies wretches, lay in waite to aſſaile them with a ſeconde deſaſter more extreme then the firſte, whoſe alaram made a conuercion of their hymnes and Pſalmes of reioycinge, into teares and dollorous exclamacions: for as they lay at anker, in the euenyng when the nighte began to couer the earthe with his darke mantell, beholde a pirott of the Mores (partaker alſo of the malice of their tēpeſte) beſet theim vpon a ſoddaine, with certeine brigandines (moſt fitt veſſells to do a miſchiefe in a calme, and charged theim ſo whotly on all ſides, that beinge alredye for wearied with the tormente of their peril paſſed, and not hable to expoſe ſufficient Perillo taken priſonner and his goods ſpoiled. reſiſtance to their vnrulye force, were layde aborde wyth ſmall effucion of blood, their goodes ſpoiled, and theim ſelues caryed priſoners to Thunys to lyue in extreme miſerye vnder the ſeruile yoke of the Barbarous nations.

            Olde Minyo the father of Carmoſyna had ioyned with hys richeſſe and deſyer of worldly gaine, certeine vertues and commendable giftes, as veraye deuote in viſiting the churches and places of prayer, of a charitable diſpoſicion in releuing the diſtreſſe of thafflicted, and ſo full of compaſſion on the behalf of the nedie, that ſeldome any pore man departed from hym emptie handed, beſides, he extended amerueilus charitie and acte of pitie to the deſolate captiues amongeſte the Moares, in ſuche ſorte, as making euery yere a voyage into Barbaria, he made an ordinarie, to redeme and bring awaie with hym ten or twelue chriſtian priſoners, of whome ſuch as were hable, reſtored the price of their raunſon, whithout any intereſt, thinkinge the gaine ſufficient in that he was the cauſe of their deliuerie, but the reſte he ſente frelie into their countrey exſpectynge the méede of that vertue at the handes of god, with this onely charge, that in remēbrance of the benefit, they wold not forget him in their priuat praiers. The gifte of welth was not euill beſtowed vpon this marchant, conſidering he was thankefull in ymparting it to the

poore, accordinge to thadmonicion of the goſpell, but howe manye maye a man reckon in england, that excedes hym in riches, and ſkarce one of ſemblable vertue, for the peruerſatie of our age is comme to that pointe, that wheare our fathers and grandfathers delited in workes of charitie, with care to ſupplie the neceſſitie of ſuche as did wante, our Helloes & golphes of riches do not only cloſe their eares againſt the lamētable cries of the néedie, but alſo make no conſciēce to diſpoile theim, either by awe, feare or flattery, of that litle which their fortune hath lefte theim, in ſuch ſorte, that Almes and deuocion ſeames ſuch ſtraungers & ſo litle knowē amongeſt men now a dayes, that of thies fewe that ſoccour the poore, the moſte parte, do it rather of vayne glorie, or to condemne the barbarus diſpoſicion of hys neyghbor, thē for compaſſion on the behalfe of him that ſtandes in nede: hoſpitalitye is alſo ſo vnknowen amongeſte vs, that where oure aunceſtors buylded houſes endowinge theim with ſufficiēt reuenues to ſuſteine thimpotent and nedye perſons, with frée annuities and other meanes of reléefe, how many of the members of chriſte do we ſée in our tyme voyde of harbour to ſhroode their naked bodies, full of diſeaſes, pinched with extremitie of honger and colde, redie to giue vpp the ghoſt at the gate of the richeman, & yet not reliued with ſo muche as the cromes that fall from his table: I borowe thuſmuche on the office of the preacher, not with intent to charge hym any waye with imputacion of negligence in the pulpit touching his admonicion to the people to aſſiſte the diſtreſſe of ſuche as god viſiteth with the Rodde of affliction, but in preſenting our marchantes with a familiar example of the office & dutie of a true chriſtian, to ſturr theym to the ymytacion of the like vertue, and in beinge aſhamed, that ſuche as haue gone affore vs, haue caried with theym to heauen, all effectes of charitie, to diſpoſe theym ſelues to ſeame worthye of that whiche they haue, by yeldynge a certeyne tenth or tribute of their goodes to ſuche as ye ſcripture tearmeth the deputies of chriſte aſkinge it in his name.

But now to our father Minio, who for that by thimpediment of ſicknes, was not hable to performe his voyage to Thunys, 
               The poore man demaunding his almes is the deputie of Chriſt, vvho ſaithe vvhat vve geue to the nedy vve beſtovve vppon hym. in perſon, duringe the yere of ympriſonment of the Napolytans, gaue charge to certeine his factors to redeme ten Captiues of his countrey, or at leaſt to furniſhe the nomber with any that profeſſed the Lawe of Chriſt, which was performed accordingly with ſuch good fortune on the behalfe of Antonio Perillo, that he enioyed a perticipacion of the deuocion and benefite of Minio, and was ſent to Naples amongeſt the reſt that were redemed, not beinge knowen notwithſtanding of any his copriſoners or other of ye company, for that they had not had any great enterview together, and muche leſſe of his Perillo redemed from pryſon. famylyar frendes, ſeinge the penurie of impriſonemente had ſet a die of hideus compleriō vpon his face, and his heare and beard exceding their ordynarie length, had ouergrowen certeine ſpeciall markes whiche els had diſcouered hym more eaſely. But what can beguile the eye of a louer, or who is hable to conceile from a womā the face of him, whoſe picture ſhe beareth in the bottom of her hart, and whoſe remembrance death hym ſelfe is ſkarce hable to deface, Carmoſyna, which made her thought a loking glaſſe to beholde euery day thymage of her Perillo, had no ſoner glaunced ſimplie vpon hym, but ſhe knew it was he, who for her ſake had paſſed the panges of ſo manye tormentes, wherewith no leſſe glad of his retorne, then hee doble dowtfull of the contynuance of her good wyll, wrought ſo muche by the ſleighte of her gouerneſſe, that ſhe had place of conferrence with hym in ſecrete, where after certeine congratulacions of his delyuerye ſhee expoſed tearmes of compforte in this ſorte.
            Albeit (ſayth ſhe) fortune hath bene ſo incenſed agaynſte Carmoſyna comfortethe Perillo. you, that ſhe hath neither ſpite nor malice in ſtore whereof you haue not taſted to thuttermoſt force and extremitie, yet your Carmoſyna hathe neyther forgot anye parte of thauncient goodwil ſhe hath borne you nor much leſſe entred into the leaſte contempte that may be ymagyned, but where a

nomber of other Ladies, would haue diſmiſſed their affection at the firſte ſommonce of aduerſatie, I am here to aduouche an vndowted contynuacion of zeale, wyth a treble increaſe of true loue towardes you, wherof I am alſo to yelde you a preſent proofe in doble ſort the one wyth an aſſurance of reciprocal amytie vntil thextreme date of my dayes, the other, in conſideracion that your pouertie proceded by my meanes. I haue prouyded a ſeconde ſupplie of monie to renewe efteſones your traffique, which being guided by a better fortune wil yelde you (I hope) a ſucceſſe of ſuche commoditie as my father will denye you no more the title of hys ſonne in law, whereof for my parte, I pronownce (from thinſtante) ſuche confirmacion as is in me to performe: Theſe newes vnloked for, ſturred vpp a traunce of ſuch alteracions in the trobled mynde of Perillo, that what with the gredie deſyer hys eyes had to féede vpon her bewtie, whych he had not regarded of longe tyme but by inwarde contemplacion, and the paſſion of preſent gladnes in thaſſurance of her loue, wyth a franke offer of ſpedie aſſiſtance to reſtore hys trade, he had neyther the vſe of hys tongue to expoſe tearmes of thanks, and much leſſe the conſent of hys ſences to beleue that which he hard, but as one Zenopholus attēding the aunſwere of hys oracle or ſoddeinly ſtriken wyth a dome apploplexie, ſtode as immouable as thymage of ſaint petre in the Capitoll of Rome, till ſhe rechargde hym wyth a ſeconde conſolacion, and withall preſented hym wyth certeine bagges full of duckattes, wher of ſhe wylled hym to defraie the value of his raunſome to the factors of her father, and diſpoſe the reſt in a ſecond venture for marchandiſe, which he performed accordinglie, wyth the benefyt of ſo good tyme and fortune, that ſailyng with a proſperus wynde to Leuant, he made hys markett to ſuch aduantage, that (in hys reatorne to Naples,) thincreaſe and gaine of his trade, redemed euery poſſeſſion which earſt he ſolde, and left hym beſides ſufficiente to furniſhe his lackes in euery reſpecte, in ſuche ſorte, as the common iudgemente paſſed,

that his welthe was nothinge inequall to the richeſſe of his father, and his preſent ſtate as plentiful of all thinges as the firſt day he ſeaſed vppon the coffers and remaine of olde Perillo: amongeſt the reſt of the frendes of Antonio, whyche reioyſed his happie fortune, Carmoſyna I am ſewer was not leaſte glad, chiefly for that ſhe ſawe her father begin to grow in delite with the doinges of the younge man, who for hys part alſo renewinge a dayly increaſe of affection towardes his miſtres, was in deuiſe, by what meanes he might eftſones bord the goodwil of her father, whō he iudged colde vſe ſmall reaſon in refuſinge his requeſte, ſeinge his richeſſe were equall to thappetit of his gredie mynde, and his poſſeſſions and patrymony nothing inferior to the beſt of ye Citie, wherfore for the more honor and ſolemnitie of the demand, he ſent hys vncle to ſommon the faire Carmoſyna, in ſorte of lawfull mariage with an offer of dowry at the diſcrecion of her father, who not ignorante of the league of longe loue betwene his doughter and Perillo, whome hee knewe to haue firſte entred into chaunge of lyfe for the onely reſpect of her fauor, thought it as great conſcience to condiſcende, as they had reaſon to make the requeſt, wherupon addinge an effect of expedicion to their preſent agrement, the bale of contract was drawen and the mariage publiſhed ymediatly betwene Antonio Perillo and the faire Carmoſyna to the ſpeciall content Perillo and Carmoſyna maried. ment of theym ſelues and ſingler pleaſure of the parentes on both ſides, which notwythſtandinge was vnhappelye abbridged contrarye to all their exſpectacions, by the malice of a pitifull accident which fell vpon theym the very night of their mariage in the houſe of tholde Minio: it was in the middeſt of the moneth of Iune, at what time the heates beinge moſt vehemente, do force terrible thonders and rage of weather in great extremitie, by certein drye vapours and exhalacions whych the heat ayre draweth vp from the drye earth when as our infortunat Louers were newe gon to bedd, deuiſinge together of their ſondrye miſfortunes ſince the begynnynge

ſecret conference.
            This was thexerciſe of that nighte of bothe the louers equall in deſier, and yet the one ignorant of the others greffe, waſtinge indifferently in ſighes and wiſhes, as apprentiſes of the thinge, wherin thoſe that begyn be alwayes moſt hoat, and ſuch as contynue gaine ſkill by longe practiſe, and yet the beſt experienced of al, are voyde of reſiſtance againſt ſuch an euill, and lacke gouernement in the conueigh of ſo hurtfull a caſe.
            The morninge had no ſoner diſcouered her glorious beames, and the meſſēger of the ſon ſomoned the loathſom night to retire, but the weary knight left his reſtles bedd, with intent to take leaue of his hoſteſſe, and chalenge the ſkoape of the larg feldes, to record & enterteine hys amarus thoughts, in retorning to hys mothers houſe, wherin notwithſtanding he founde a ſtaie of his meaning by the honeſt ymportunitie of tholde lady, who with more intreatie then was nedefull to ſo willyng a gueſte, won hym eaſely to determyn hys taryenge till dynner, till whyche tyme, he founde a ſupplye of exerciſe wyth her companie, and conference of her daughter, in whom he ſaw contynual cauſe to aggrauat his affection, and doble occaſion to encreaſe hys deſier, in ſuch ſorte, as his aſtonyed countenance, and broken aunſweres, ymporting moſt oftē the cōtrary of their demaunds, ſhowed ſufficiently ye troble & war in his mind, which albeit ye ſubtil Geniuera, cōſtrued according to a troth, yet her ſimple mother imputed it to an honeſt ſhame & want of audacitie in ye gentlemā, for yt he had not much haunted ye cōpany of ladyes, wherin as they ſpente the moſt part of the morning, without (notwithſtāding) that Dom Diego, had the hart to diſcouer the leaſte part of his promiſe of ye night, ſo yt hower of dinner ſōmoned them to breake their diſcourſe & performe ye due to thappetit of nature, wyth ſuche delicate & ſumpteouſe fare as the good lady had prouided, in declaracion of ye hartie zeale ſhe bare to her gueſt, who after dinner failed not in humble ſorte to be thankfull to his hoſtes, with aſſuraunce that, albeit he was

not hable to requite her curteſſe with equall conſideracion, yet his goodwill at all tymes ſholde be nothinge inferior to the greatnes of her merit, wherewith he addreſſed the reſt of hys dutie to her daughter, whoſe bewtie (as you ſée) had made ſo great a wound in hys harte, that the remembrance remayned till the laſt hower of hys lyfe, and as he kiſſed her hande with intente to decipher that whych he had ymagined all the night, he became ſo amazed wyth thympedimente he felte in his tongue, with ſtraunge diuerſatie in all hys ſences, that he ſeamed no leſſe aſhamed of his preſent weaknes in that place, then afore he was fullie reſolued to diſcharge there ſolucion and meaninge of hys hart, whych albeit gaue ſome cauſe of litle aſtoniſhment to the younge Lady, yet ſhe founde indifferente occaſion of pleaſure and pitie in hys paſſion, for that as ye one proceded by her meanes, ſo ſhe felt a motion in conſcience to expoſe the other for the relefe of hym who ſuffred for her ſake, wherefore with a trobled regarde tempered with ſufficiente argumentes of affection on her behalf, ſhe brake his dome traunce with theſe words, I wiſh ſir (ſayth ſhe) that you might fynde aſmuch pleaſure in your paſſion, as the ſame hath ymparted equall gréefe to others, and that your future abſence may pinche you with no leſſe annoye, then your preſent departure leaueth me deſyerus to enioye a longer tyme of your preſence, whyche philoſophye not loked for of the knight, did not only diſmyſſe his ſcilence and vntye the charme of hys tongue, but alſo renforced hym to an audacitie to yelde her thankes for the compaſſion ſhe vſed to hys diſtres, with addicion that onely he was happie aboue all the worlde, to be partaker of ſo liberal a wiſhe, but chiefly to heare her in tearmes of deſier touchinge hys preſence, whych wyth hys lyfe and al that he had he bound ther by othe, to be preſte at all howers to performe the recucion of her commaundemente, wherunto ſhe replied with thankes according to the affection that gouerned her, with requeſt eftſones (and that wyth a reciprocal looke and ſoft ſighe) not to forget hereafter the waye to the caſtell of her

mother, to whom (ſhe aſſured hym) the welcomeſt gueſte of the worlde, and for her parte, ſhe accompted it a felicitye to participate in her pleaſure, and kepe in entier the league of frendſhipp, where with heretofore bothe their houſes haue ben bliſſed from the beginninge, where with time, with the nomber of aſſiſtantes, witneſſing their glee, forced an abridgement of their farewel, contrarie albeit to both their wills, the one retirynge to her chamber, with more care and leſſe quiet then afore, and the other, with a thouſand hamours in his head, tooke his waye to the houſe of his mother, to whom he ymparted his aduenture, his diſtres, beinge lefte of hys men in a place vnknowē, his horſe ouercome with èxtreme trauel, and that which worſte was, thapproche of night, and his diſpaire to fynde harbor, when not withſtādyng he chanced vppon the caſtell of the olde Ladye, of whoſe curteſie & beautye of her doughter he made a perticular diſcourſe, leauynge oute notwitſtandynge, the glée betwene Geniuerae and hym, wyth requeſte that it woulde pleaſe her, to ioyne with hym in ſome honeſte meane of thankefull conſideration to theim bothe, whereunto he founde his mother no leſſe readie in conſente, then hym ſelfe deſyerous to vſe expedicion in theffecte, ſo that wyth her aduiſe, the platt was made to inuite theym to her houſe the weke followynge, and that he alone ſhoulde worke theffect, like as he founde hymſelfe moſte charged with the dett of their curteſie, and deſyer to requite it, whereunto he added ſuche diligence, that vppon his letter and humble requeſte, he gott the conſente of the mother and doughter, whiche both failed not of their promiſſ at the daye appointed.

            In the receiuing of this hawke, appeared abſolute ſhowes of the euill fortune of the pore Diego, which immediatly fayled not to thunder vppon hym without cōpaſſion, for as he went often to viſitt his myſtres, ſo he forgott not continually to cary this hawke vppon his fiſte, boaſtinge ſo farr vppon the goodnes of the birde, that he chaunced in her preſence to ſaye that it was one of the thinges in the worlde he helde moſte deare.
            Sewerly this wordes were ſifted more nerely then there was cauſe, and conſtrued to other end, then he mente them, ſeinge that certeine dayes after in his abſence, deuiſing vppon his ſondry vertues, ſome commended his honeſte and curteus behauior, ſome gaue praiſe to his valyauntnes and dexteritie in armes, ſome exalted in him the ſondrye giftes of nature, and paſſing further, he was generallye preferred of all the companie for his ſinceritie and conſtant dealynge

There is the miſte that dimmeth your eyes, ſayeth this cankarde ennemye of Diego, for vnder the vaile of a periured loyaltie, he abuſeth the ſimplicitie of honeſte Ladyes, whereof I nede not go farr for a prooff, nor you doubt much of the miſterye, if you conferr the circumſtāce of his former profeſſion towardes you, with the preſente▪ league of frende ſhipp betwene him and the doughter of Dom ferrando de la Sara, cōfirmed alredye by the gyfte of a taſſell gentle, which for her ſake he eſtemeth aboue all the thinges in the world, which laſt allegatiō reſtoring a remembrance of the words, pronounced not longe ago by the knight touching the deare accompte he made of his hawke, began to brede a ſuſpicion of his conſtancie, and an aſſured creditt in the information Geniuera falleth ī diſdain vvith Diego. of thunhappie Graciano, wherein ſwelling immediatly with her vniuſt collor incenſed by a ſimple & cold Ielowſie, was forced to abandon the place, & retire into her chamber, wher ſhe gaue ſuche ſkoape to her ſyniſter conceite, that ſhe was vpon tearmes manye times to vſe force againſte her ſelfe,

whereunto ſhe had added preſent diſpatche, if a hope to procure in time the reuenge of the wronge, whiche ſhe perſwaded to haue receiued of her Diego, had not ſtaide thexecution, albeit ſhe coulde not ſo gouerne her malicious diſpoſition, but the deadly hate conceiued in this moment againſt thinnocente gentleman, did not onely ſupplante both ſtocke and roote of aunciente zeale on her parte, but alſo grewe to ſuche mortalitie in her venemous ſtomake, that ſhe ſeamed not to delite ſo muche in the vſe of her owne life, as in deſyer to take pleaſure in the remembrance of the death of hym, who no leſſe innocent in the cauſe, then ignorante of the grudge, came the nexte mornynge (as he was wonte) to ſée her, hauing vppon his fiſte (by euill fortune) the birde which bredd firſte this mortall Ielowzye: And as he ſatt deuiſyng with her mother, fyndinge a wante of thaccuſtomed companie of his miſtres, he aſked where ſhe was, whereunto he was aunſwered by one of her women, that aſſone as ſhe ſawe hym enter the houſe, ſhe tooke her chamber, all whiche he diſſimuled by his wiſdom, imagininge the ſame to procede of ſome wanton fancie or coye conceite, whereunto the moſt part of women are cōmonly incident, ſo that when he ſawe his time, he tooke leaue of her mother & departed, meting by chaunce as he wente downe the ſteares of the hall, one of the chambrieres or Gentlewomen of Geniuera, whō he requeſted to kiſſe the hande of his miſtres on his behalfe, whiche ſhe promiſed to performe, hopinge to do a thinge no leſſe acceptable to her miſtres, then to gaine thankes of him on whoſe behalfe ſhe preſented the curteſie.
            Albeit, as it is to be thoughte that Geniuera enioyed litle quiet and leſſe contentemente in this meane while, ſolicited, I can not tell, by what deſyer to defye whollye the remembrance of Diego, wherein ſhe was the rather forthered by an information, that he bare ſtill the tarſſell of hys fyſte, whyche ſhe iudged to be done onely in deſpite of her, So when her woman offred to preſente thimbaſſage of the knighte, ſhe fell into ſuche tearmes of frenzie, that the

ſimple brute or name of Dom Diego ſturred vp ſuch hainous alterations within her, that to her former wroth, was added a preſent wodnes, in ſuch ſorte, that ſhe ſeamed for the tyme to labor indifferently betwene thextreme panges of death, and vſe of longer lif, albeit reſtored at laſte by the greate diligence of her woman, ſhe coulde not ſo wholly diſmiſſe her furie, but ſhe imparted the paſſion of her anger to her eyes, who after they had ſome what eaſed her inwarde greef by a nomber of dollorous teares, put her e

wilfull crueltie of Geniuera, blaſphemyng no leſſe agaynſte the whole ſecte (paraduenture) with ſome raiſon. For there is (I can not tel) what ſecret motions in the myndes of women which haue their howers and tymes as thincreaſynge or dyminiſhynge of the moone, whereof as it is veray harde (without great experience) to giue any raiſon touchinge the cauſe, So we ſée it is ſuch a principle or generalitie amongſt theime to ymprinte ſo ſewerly in their hartes this fraile or rather inconſtante inſtinctes of mobilitie, that the wiſeſte & moſt ſubtill that euer was, lacke ſkill to obſerue the ſeaſons of this ymperfecte humor.
            
               Dom Roderico by this was arryued at his houſe, wher he neither forgatt his owne promiſſe, nor the neceſſitie of hys frende, for the nexte daye he wente to the lodgynge of Geniuera, not to communicate with her aſyett, and muche leſſe to impart his fortunat encounter in his retorne out of Gaſcoyn, but rather to ſounde by ſome ſecrett circumſtance a farr of, the doinges and determination of the girle, & whether any other vſurped the glorie of the victorie, which of righte belonged to his frende Diego, wherein he was ſo ſubtill in this drifte, that he accoaſted the page of the gentlewoman, in whoſe boſome was builded the only ſtore houſe of her moſte ſecret affaires, forgettinge therin the precepte of the wiſe, who willes vs to cōmit no councell to ſuche as are weake of raiſon, and for wāte of diſcretion, do lacke the gifte of ſecretenes, The vviſe man vvil neuer comytt councelle to children whereby they are not hable to gouerne the libertye of their tounges, ſuche was the ſimplicitie of this page, whoſe ſofte humor, the knighte fed with ſuch fine dyot, that by litle and litle, he drew the worme quite from his noſe, and was made ſo priuie to the practis of Geniuera, that he vnderſtode, that ſince her vniuſte diſpleaſure with Dom Diego, ſhe hadd vowed her good wil to a biſkaine, as then ye ſteward of her mothers houſe, a gentleman veray pore, but for the reſt of ſufficiēt perfection, & that he was now in ye cōtrey, frō whence he gaue aduertiſmēt to his miſtres, yt within two days he wold come wt ij. other his deare frends, to take Geniuera, awaye by

So he ſware in great rage, to caſte ſuch a blocke in the waye of the two louers, that neyther the biſkayn ſholde reape the frutes due to the trauaile and ſeruice of his frende Diego, nor his cruell miſtres forbeare any longer to ſende a pleaſante calme to the ſtormye tempeſt whiche kepes hym now at anker amongeſt the perillous rockes of Pireneus.
            
            For being enformed of this conuenient meane to eaſe the diſtreſſe of his languiſhinge frend, who fedd only of the hope of his promiſe, he failed not to add an aſſured effect according lie, Albeit for his further inſtruction touching the ſewer con ueigh of the miſterie, he went the ſeconde daye after, to viſit the mother of Geniuera, wher he vnderſtode by the page, that the ſtewarde was come with two other valyante gentlemen to aſſiſte his enterpriſe, and that the nexte nighte vppon the firſt hower after midnighte, when the olde Ladye and all her ſeruantes, ouerwhelmed wyth the charme or mantel of dead ſlepe, were leaſt apte to ſuſpect conſpiracies, they determyned to depart the caſtell with his miſtres, who for her parte had furniſhed her wantes of all neceſſaryes touchinge the voyage.

But ſhe renewinge the remembrance of hym that laye dead of the ground, by certeine ſtreames of his blodd, whyche ſhe eſpied vpon the gawntlet of Roderico, began to loaſe more pacience then affore, in ſuch ſorte, that the rudeſt of the companye, hauing for an increaſe of his terrible regarde a viſarne or falſe beard of blacke heare curled like the Mauretyne, with a paire of counterfaite eyes of glaſſe, approched (by appointment) the trembing Geniuera, to whoſe feare hee added an increaſe of terror in offringe the point of hys naked dagger to her white and delicate necke, threatninge, that if ſhe contynued in theſe tearmes, hys handes ſhold performe the ſacrafize of her life, to the ſhadowe of the villayne whom ſhe lamented ſo much, and who (ſaith he) deſerued rather to be broken in peces of the whele, by the execucioners of tormentes, then ende hys lyfe by the handes of a valyant knight, which mortall threates (as ſhe thought) forcing her to an vnwilling ſcilence, left her only thaſſiſtāce of her eyes, to yelde compaſſion to her greffe, who ſet a broch ſo larglye the conduites of their watery humors, that the paſſion of her harte appeared in thabundance of her teares and brokē ſighes, whoſe force preuailed ſo much ouer her tender reſiſtance, that in thende her outwarde dule ſeamed incloſed and couched by force, in the ynner corners of her heauy harte, in the meane while the reſte of the companye, had caryed the bodie of the deade biſkayne to a felden chapel, builded vpon the high way ſide, where he ſleapes in hisfatal bed couered with a teſtor of greene ſoddes.
