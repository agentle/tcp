               Step forth & take in hand
               These felowes to wtstand
               In number like the sande
               That wyth the Gospel melles
               And wil do nothynge elles
               But tratlinge tales telles
               Agaynste our holy prelacie
               And holy churches dignitie
               Sayinge it is but papistrie
               Yea fayned and Hypocrisy
               Erronious and heresye
               And taketh theire authoritye
               Out of the holy euangelie
               All customes ceremoniall
               And rites ecclesiastical
               Not grounded on scripture
               No longer to endure
               And thus ye may be sure
               The people they allure
               And drawe them from youre lore
               The whiche wil greue you sore
               Take hede I saye therfore
               Your nede was neuer more

To here be hind your backe
               Howe they wyll carpe and cracke
               And none of you that dare
               With one of them compare
               Yet some ther be that are
               So bolde to shewe there ware
               And is no priest nor deacon
               And yet wyl fire his be cone
               Against such felowes fraile
               Make out wyth to the and nayle
               And hoyste vp mayne saile

               With penne and ynke and paper
               And like no trifling Japer
               To touch these felowes in dede
               And I in dede am he
               That wayteth for to se
               Who dare so hardy be
               To encounter here with me
               I stande here in defence
               Of sume that be far hence
               And can both blysse and sence
               And also vnder take
               Right holy thinges to make
               Yea god within a cake
               
                  
And who so that forsake
               His breade shalbe dowe bake
               I openly professe
               The holy blissed masse
               Of strength to be no lesse
               Then it was at the firste
               But I woulde se who dourst
               Set that amonge the worst
               For he should be acurst
               With boke and bell and candel
               And so I would him handel
               That he shoulde right wel knowe
               Howe to escape I trow
               So hardy on his head

               Orels to prate or patter

               This is a playne matter
               It nedeth not to flatter
               They be suche holy thinges
               As hath bene vsed with kinges

               Such things without their reach
               And some ther be that say

               And solemne belles do ringe
               But these babes be to yonge
               Perkyng vpon theyr patins
               And fayne would haue the mattes
               
                  
And eueninge songe also
               In Englishe to be do
               With mariage and baptising
               Burialles and other thyng
               In vulgare tonge to saye and sing
               And so they do it newly
               In diuerse places truly
               Sayinge they do but duely
               Maynteinyng it in any wyse
               So shoulde they do their seruice
               Alasse who woulde not mone
               Or rather grount or grone
               To se suche seruice gone
               Whiche saued many one
               From dedly synne and shame
               And many a spote of blame
               From purgatorye payne
               And many showre of rayne
               Wel yet I saye agayne
               Some honest men remayne
               And kepe there customes stil
               And euer more wyl
               Wherfore in dede my read is
               To take you to your beades
               Al men and women I saye
               That vseth so to praye
               
                  
That such good priestes maie
               Continue so alwaye
               Or eles none other like
               But al lieth in the dyke
               And loke ye do not faynt
               But pray to some good saynt
               That he maye make restraint
               Of all these straung facions
               And greate abonamacions
               Because I maye not tary
               I praye to swete Sir Harry
               A man that wyl not vary
               And one that is no sculker
               But kna. knyghte of the sepulchre
               That he maye stand fast
               And be not ouer cast
               Or eles to be the last
               Of al them that do yelde
               In city towne or fielde
               For if he 
                     •
                  ike therin
               No doute he shal not blin
               Tyl he come to eternitie
               With al his whole fraternite
               A men therfore saye ye
               That his partakers be
               Ye get no more of me
