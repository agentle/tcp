               WHen as thies two orations of that great learned and right godlie minister of gods worde Theoder De Besza were broght vnto me, to be trāslated out of frenche into englishe, gētle, Reader for that of certen yeres before I knew ye man to be of so great knowledge and specially so greatly fearing God, I was driuen with a great desyre to reade them, and after that I had redde them, with a more feruent desyre, was I rapt (whatsoeuer other busynes I had to do being layd asyde) to trāslate them. Not onely for that they flowed from suche a notable instrument of God, but also specially because that in the name and by aduise

and assent of so many excellent, and godlie learned ministeres, they were pronounced, and that in suche a famouse and moste honorable audience. The matters conteined in the same orations, be maters of oure religion & suche as at this present be in controuersie, and therefore moste nedefull to be knowen vnto the faithfull of oure cuntrie, the faithfull I mean that be but of simple knowledge & yet be desyrous to learne. Aswell because thereby they may by vertue of gods word establish their consciences in the treuth of these maters, as also for that they may there summarelie haue in a redynes, oute of ye holie Scriptures, good and sufficient auctorities, to defend them selues in the same, against the malicious

soldiors of Satan the Papistes and lykewise to confounde them with all their sophisticall and vnreasonable reasons: whiche haue not onely of a long season moste craftely seduced many, but also moste crewelly suppressed and destroied many of the faithfull with the name and auctoritie of the Churche whiche they moste wrongfully and iniuriously arrogated to them selues, when as in very dede they were, and be no thing els but the horrible and filthie Synagoge of ye deuill, as by their stinking and detestable maners and theire blasphemous and moste pestilent doctrine (whiche be their frutes) may moste euidently appere vnto all them whiche haue any knowledge in ye worde of God. For without any

lawfull calling, by diuerse vnlefull meanes boeth against Gods law and mans law, haue they intruded them selues, into the Churche of God, and in stede of the liuely worde of God they haue taught their owne doctrine and dreames: and the holy Sacramentes, with their away taking, that whiche the Lorde Iesus instituted, and commanded, and with their to putting, many things whiche the Lorde Iesus neuer commanded, they haue altogether altered and contamined. So that in stede to haue God honored, and the people of God edified taught strengthened and cō
               forted, they haue dishonored and blasphemed the Maiestie of God and to their vtermoste discouraged and destroyed his people.

But the chief maters herein contened, be thies. The Churche and what it is, the marcks of the true Churche, what aucthoritie it haeth, & whether it may erre. If it please thee gentle Reader with iudgement of a sincere heart to consider thies orations, thou shalt finde the same boeth godlie and learnedly declared to the praise of God, and edefieng of his faithfull people.
         
      
      
         
            
            
            An answer made the twentie four day of Septembre a thousand fyue hundreth sixtie and one
            
               Being arriued at Poissy twelue ministers of the worde of God ī an hall, where were present, the Quene mother, the King and Quene of Nauarre, the princes of the blood royall and all the Lordes of Counsell, and other Lordes, of the one parte: and on the other parte, fyue Cardinalles with many busshops and Theologues of all sortes.
            The Lorde Cardinall of Lorrane declared in few wordes, that this assemblie was made, to heare, what

that we had to say vnto that, which he had propounded, eight dayes before, whervnto Theodore de Besza rising vp, in the name of the said 12 ministers, for all the frenche Churches reformed, answered as followeth, hauing an verie good audience and attention of all the assemblie.
            Madame, first calling vpon the name of oure Lorde God,
                  
                     〈1 paragraph〉
                  
                that it may please him to assist vs with his especiall grace in an mater of so great consequence, that we may be vtterly voyde of all particuler opinions and passions, and that their might be planted in to oure heartes in stede thereof a right knowledge of his veritie with an earnest desire to set it forth to the honnor of his holie name, and to the auancement of youre maiestie and to the quietnes of

all Christendome, and namelie of this realme, we shall brieflie answer vnto that, whiche it haeth plesed the Lorde Cardinall to declare vnto vs, vpon two pointes onelie of our confession, which haeth bene three tymes presented vnto youre maiestie: to wit,
                  
                     〈1 paragraph〉
                  
                vpon that whiche concerneth the Churche, and the aucthoritie thereof, and vpon the holy supper of oure Lorde Iesus Christe.
            Trew it is, that if we might haue had the fauore to haue made answer immediatlie when as we had a freshe remembrance of that, that we had heard, or els that we might haue had in oure handes, the said oration to consider it, we might haue answered more destinctly point by point, and perhappes more properly. But how soeuer it be, we

shall speak thereof, that wc God will giue vnto vs, so that men may vnderstād wherein, we may alredie be accorded, and likwyse the pointes, wherein as yet we vary and be different, whereof we humblie pray oure God, that according to his great mercies, it may please him to aggree vs.
            
               
                  
                     〈1 paragraph〉
                  
               So now as touching ye first point of the Churche, we shall treat it in thre partes. The first, what is the Churche. The seconde, what be the markes of it. The third what is the authoritie thereof.
            
               
                  
                     〈1 paragraph〉
                  
               It is moste certen that this name of the Churche is taken and drawen oute of a greke worde, whiche signifieth as muche,
                  
                     〈1 paragraph〉
                  
                as to call frome one place to an other. But we find in the Scripture, that there is two maner of callinges, the one is

               
                  •
               oyned with the efficacie of the holy Spririt, of the whiche is spoken in ye right chapitre of the Epistle to the Romains, where it is said,Rom▪ 30 that God 
                  •
               ustifieth them, that he calleth:
                  
                     〈1 paragraph〉
                  
                the other, althogh it be the self same outwardlie, as the first is, yet is it of no value vnto saluation, not that the faute thereof commeth of God, but of the men that wil be deaf, following yt whiche is cōmonlie said, that there is none deafer,Mat

                   22. then he yt will not vnderstand.
            And of this calling haeth the Lord spoken, when he said,
                  
                     〈1 paragraph〉
                  
                there be many called and few chosen.
            Beholde therefore consequently it behoueth that this name of the Churche signifieng the company of them that are gathered together, by the voyce of God, whiche haeth called them, is taken two wayes.
            
               For being taken generally for al

                them whiche make outwarde profession to answer vnto God, whiche calleth them, there is no dout bu
                  •
                there be many hypocrites and reprobat comprehended therein.
            And for oure part my Lorde Cardinall, neuer (God be praysed) haue we spoken nor written otherwayes, seing it is a thing whereof we neuer had debate, because it is moste clerelie expressed in the Scriptures and confirmed by a continuall experience.
            But yf nede be to take this name of the Churche more properly, and more streitlie, as often tymes it must nedes be taken, then say we, that it doth not comprehend any, but the assemblie of the elect and predestinate of God.
            And to the intent that ye may vnderstand, yt we haue not forged this

maner of speaking, and yet les this

            Now by this meanes groweth there a question, to wit whether the Churche be inuisible, the wc semeth that so it must be concluded, seing yt God onelie may know his elect and predestinate: & also that we say, yt we beleue the holie Churche, and that whiche is beleued, is not sene.That whiche is beleued is not sen
            
            But hereof there followeth a greate inconuinient, if simply and barely we speak so of it. For if it be so, vnto what company may a man ioyn him self, & what meanes shall we vse to haue saluation if we knowe not ye Churche whereunto we may ioyn oure selfes

considering that vpon the Churche onely, Iesus Christe powreth oute his vertue and force, to saue mankinde?
            Trew it is (my Lorde Cardinall) if I remembre well, that ye alledged yet an other inconuenient, whereof we be not satisfied to wit,
                  
                     〈1 paragraph〉
                  
                that if the Churche were inuisible, that then we should not somuche as knowe oure King: yt whiche thing we could not, vnderstand.
            For the Scripture teacheth vs to know oure superiours, and to obey them in all thinges (sauing ye honnor that we owe vnto God onely) yea althogh they be infideles in dede.

                  om. 13 5▪ 6. But let this be spoken as by the way. I returne to my purpose. We say therefore yt althogh the true Churche be inuisible

in respect of that, that we haue said: neuertheles when there is question vnto what company we oght to associat, & ioyn oure selues, we haue certen markes,The certen marcke of the true Church to wit, the pure word of God, and the sincere administration of his Sacramentes, the whiche markes be euident and perceiuable in suche sorte, yt where they be we oght not to doubt, that there is the true Churche of God.
            And we must according to the ruell of charitie, holde all for faithfull, that make profession of ye pure religion, except that God discouer theire dissimulation & feynednes. And of this saint Paule giueth vs a good example, where he calleth the Corinthiens & Galathiens, saintes, and faithfull, and doeth attribute vnto them ye name

of the Churche, althogh there was amongest them greate fautes aswell in the ignorance of doctrine, as in theire liuing.
            This is it whiche also he haeth declared, in an other place, that all they wc kepe ye foundation buyld not alwayes thereon gold, siluer, or precious stones, but also hay & chaffe.
            Se now how we speake of the Churche, without making thereof an imagined & a fantasticall thing, and without giuing occasion as I suppose,

               I come nowe vnto the marckes & witnessinges of the Churche, the whiche is very nedefull to be marcked and marcked again, seing that withoute the same, there is no saluation,Ther

            I haue said that it haeth two certen infallible marckes that is to say the preaching of the worde of God and the sincere administration of the Sacramentes. Some ioyne thereunto the discipline of the Churche and ye frutes of the preaching of the Euangile, as of a trueth it behoueth that euery assemblie,Oure sinnes be the cause that d

            But forsomuche as our sinnes be often tymes the cause that thies

two pointes in no wyse appere vnto men: therefore we will content oure selues with the two first.
            As touching the worde that it is a sure marcke of the Churche it appereth by this that the same worde is cōpared vnto a sede bothe by Iesus Christ & by saint Peter.

For notwithstanding that the doctrine af the Euangile is more then credible, without hauing authoritie of ancientie, & that it commeth often to passe through oure iniquities, and by the iust vengeance of God, that it is as new vnto men, as that it oght to be vnto them familiare and accustumed: yet this notwithstanding the witnes of an ancient and continuall succession serueth much vnto men, to make them the more inexcusable.
            And as touching the succession of persones we auowe it also, but vnder condition and prouided that it

            Lyke as contrarywyse, they that preache not at all: or that in stead of the doctrine of the Apostles preache their owne doctrine althogh they alledge a thousand predecessors following one an other, they oght not to be hearde as pastors, but to be fled from, as wolues, by the expres cō

                That is the ordinarie vocatiō in the whiche the ordre is kept that God haeth established in the Churche. And in this ordre first of all there is examination of the doctrine & of the lyfe, then after there is lawfull election & finaly there is imposition of hādes.

            These may ye see in many places of the Scripture to be put and conioyned together, as in the election of Saint Matthias and of the vij deacons in the Actes of the Apostles and also in that whiche is written in S. Paules Epistles vnto Timothee and to Tite.Act. 5.6.
            
            This now is the ordanarie vocation, whereby it may be easely cō
               sidered

what is the extraordinarie vocation:
                  
                     〈1 paragraph〉
                  
                in the whiche notwithstanding yt one of these two thinges or two of them, yea or all the three be wanting, yet is it laufull by the authoritie of God. That oure Lorde haeth often tymes vsed suche extraordinarie vocations, it appereth through out the Scriptures.
                  
                     〈1 paragraph〉
                  
                For who laied hādes vpon Moses that he might consecrate Aaron? And who anointed in the degre of a Prophete Isaie, Daniel, Amos, and many others? And whē came that to passe? Then as they that had the ordre in their handes abused the same,
                  
                     〈1 paragraph〉
                  
                then say I, it behoued that God should extraordinarely put hand to his work, not for to bring cōfusion into his house but to correct them whiche vnder the shaddowe of ordinarie successiō had

had ouerturned and peruerted all.
            And that it is so, I referre me to the writinges of the Prophetes wc specially speake against the priestes.

But if they will alledge that the fore said Prophetes were content to rebuke and to reproue without hauīg any thing to do with the sacrifices. First of all I answer that, that is

not true euery where:
                  
                     〈1 paragraph〉

            Secondly it is no meruell if the Prophetes ī that tyme stretched not oute their comissiōn extraordinarie so farre as to circumcise & sacrifice, seing that this charge was appointed heretably vnto the rase of Leuy, the whiche thing at this day haeth no place.
            Consider now my Lordes, what we call the Churche and what we esteme of the marckes of it, & of the vocatiō of pastors, of whiche things if ye will make applicatiō vnto oure Churches or vnto oure selues, we

hope with the help of God to shew so good tokens, that none shall haue iust occasion to doubte thereof following the worde of God, and that whiche thereof is truely written, as we think in a treatise that is found amōgest ye workes of S.

                but it is in a parte. When I speake thus, I beleue yt ye know the Apostles owne wordes. For to be brief I confesse that without ye Churche there is no saluatiō: because there is no lyfe but in Iesus Christe, & Iesus Christe imployeth not his liuelie vertue no where els, but amongest his membres,

            But the question is to know whether that in this world the Churche may erre,

            Hereunto, do I answer that it is a thing without all doubte that the particuler membres of the Churche may erre, and do erre daylie bothe in doctrine and maners, according vnto that, whiche S. Paule sayeth that we knowe in a parte,1. Co

            But we will not stay oure selues so muche here, for the honnor that we heare vnto them (and yt not without

good cause) as also because if I haue well vnderstand the sayeng of my Lorde Cardinall that he is no more of that mynde then we to deceiue them without exception.
            This is it, that we vnderstand of the membres of the Churche, in particularitie, the imperfection whereof doeth not stoppe but yt the Churche is formed and made thereof.
            For by litle and litle do they go forwarde aswell in the knowledge of God, as in the amendment of life. But if the membres of the Churche be generally considered, as it is destributed in diuers diocess and prouinces shall we say that it may

            There resteth therefore to cōsider the hole Churche in an vniuersalitie but in what sorte? For cōsidering it in the estimation of an vniuersall Councell, first of all there is no greate apperance to iudge that all the vertue that the holy Goste, employeth vpon ye Churche is restreyned to an certen nombre of Prelats the whiche be not alweys ye most learned nor ye best, yea althogh they represent the hole multitude that sē

And who may than assure, but that they that were absent some tymes, had greater reuelation then they that were present.
            And besydes all this my Lordes, how long is it a go, that there reigned

him the Apostles, but the assemblies of the Prelates of Israell? If hereunto it be answered, that these thinges happened in the tyme of the olde Testament. I answer that it is not ynough spoken nor derectly answered. For the conclusion will alweys be ferme and sure that the assemblie of Prelats of the Churche how generall soeuer that it was, haue oftē tymes bene gouerned by the Spirit of error rather then by the holy Goste.
            Secondly if we come to the new Testament, S. Paule haeth not he expresly warned the Ephesiens in ye name of all the Churche,Act. 29. that there shoulde wolues come oute frome amongest the mids of the Pastors & that the sonne of perdition shoulde sit in the temple of God?2.

                And in very dede in conferring the Councelles

one with an other, there will appere so many contrarieties amongest them selues,

                that of very force ye must confesse that the holy Goste haeth not alweys there had audiēce, but that Satan for a long tyme past haeth transfigured him self into the lyght of generall Councelles for to disguise and hyde his falshode.
            There is a place in S. Augustine yt expresseth this in his second booke of Baptisme, agaīst the Donatistes 3 chaptre the whiche I haue alledged in the first oration and now for a cause will alledge it again, there it is expresly said, that the Epistles of the particuler Busshops be corrected by the prouinciall Councelles, and the prouinciall Councelles, by the generall Councelles, & the first generall Councelles adnulled by the last, when as by experiēce of things

that whiche was close is opened & that whiche was hidde is made euident.
            Unto this my Lorde Cardinall answered ī his oration yt this was to be vnderstand of exterior or outward things whiche might & oght to vary according as nede requireth. But considering the hole mater nerer it is found that this worde Emendari presupposeth that there was a faute cōmitted and after corrected, also if this answer shoulde be receiued, ye must say lykewyse of the particuler Epistles of the busshops and prouinciall Councelles the whiche is directly against the intention of Saint Augustine, whiche reasoneth there of this point and not of any exterior policie, but of one point of doctrine, to wit of the opinion of Saint Cyprian, and of the Councell of Affricke

touching rebaptisation. If there be also alledged an other argument whiche they vse, to wit, if oure Lorde haeth promised to be in ye myddes of two or three gathered to gether in his name,
                  
                     〈1 paragraph〉
                  
                now by greater reason wil he be in an assemblie vniuersall: we grant that so it may be presumed, but there is a difference betuene a presumption and a necessarie conclusion. For ye malice of man cōmeth often tymes vnto this point to abuse the name of God,
                  
                     〈1 paragraph〉
                  
                to establishe their lesings that suche may haue God in theire mouth whiche haue his enemy in their hart. The weaknes of man is so great yt there is comonlie in him an infinite nombre of dissordinate affections whiche blind oure eyes, so that we say that he whiche haeth none other foundation then the aduyse of men and the

outward apperance of a Coūcell, is rather in danger to be deceiued thē otherwys. What then? Wold we yt the doctrine of ye Churche should be vncertain seing it may erre? No thing les. For we confesse that as yet, we know in a parte,1. 
                     〈◊〉
                   9. as Saint Paule saieth, & in this respect there is alweys error mingled with the veritie, & yet neuertheles God suffereth not that the veritie in ye substanciall pointes of oure saluatiō be euer so buried in all his Churche, yt there is not alweys some nombre now more now lesse yt vnderstādeth yt whiche they oght to vnderstād, & do follow that whiche they oght to follow. Thus we see that it came passe in Israell in the tyme of Elias and in the tyme of the captiuitie of Babilon & in the tyme of the cūming of Iesus Christe, when as scarsely

was there found a Zacharie an Elizabeth, a Ioseph, a Uirgin Marie, a Simeon, and an Anna the Prophetesse,
                  
                     〈1 paragraph〉
                  
                whiche had a vnderstanding of the fulfilling of the Prophetes, amongest so great corruptions of Scrybes, Pharises and Sadduces. Suche interruptions therefore in the Churche of God ꝓceding and cōming of the iniquitie of men, be as a storme or cloudy wether, whiche afterwardes he causeth to vanishe away with ye brightnes of his worde as it pleaseth him, and according as he distributeth the secretes of his iudgementes and of mercies. Are we willing lykewyse thus to condemne the ancient Councelles? God forbid. For as ye your selues know ryght well yt if it were in question to be reuled by them ye should change mo thinges then we:

ye haue trauelled therein these dayes past, but we require yt the Scripture be the touche stone for to examyn all that is done and said in the Churche. If this seme strange I pray you my Lordes to cōsider this moste renouned place of Saint Augustine writing vnto Maximin Arian in the seconde booke. chaptre 14 Is there any generall Coūcell more authorised then the first, called the Councell of Nece?
                  
                     〈1 paragraph〉
                  
                And what is ye Councell of Arimin? A Councell reiected and cōdemned & that worthely. And whereof disputeth S. Augustine? Euen of a principall article of the beleif, yt which had bene before that often tymes fully resolued, to wit of the Cōsubstancialitie of the Sonne of God. in this mean season ye may see that S. Augustine witnesseth that for his part

he is not astricted nether to ye Coū
               cell of Nece nor yet to the Coūcell of Arimin:

                but that he will fight wt the Scriptures, whiche be, saieth he, cōmon witnesses vnto bothe parties. If any body will against this alledge the obscuritie of the Scriptures, we must nedes confesse that whiche S. Paule saieth: that ye naturall man knoweth not those thīges that be of God,

And moreouer in what case had they bene in then that had no thing but ye scriptures of the Apostles, before yt euer there was any cōmentaries written by the Ancients? And yet further I remembre my Lorde Cardinall yt in youre oration, youre aduyse was to receiue for sure interpretation and Apostolycall tradition, that whiche haeth bene alweys receiued in the Churche euerywhere, & of all men.

                But who may assure vs of these thre pointes? Certenly no mā as I suppose. For the diuersitie is infinite yt is founde in the bookes of the Ancients, yea and that in the articles of the faith.
            
               Furthermore if we must come vnto these wordes, alwayes and of all, at what tyme shall we begin except at the Apostolicall Churche? And who shalbe the first in ye coūte but the Apostles of whom ye historie was faythfully written by Saint Luke & that whiche may be knowen by theire owne writinges. So therefore my Lordes to conclude, forasmuche as all trueth cōmeth of God, who haeth taken for his trushmen in that, that concerneth oure saluation, the Prophetes and Apostles, we returne alwayes vnto this foundation of the Scriptures, and yet will we receiue the aduise of coū
               celles and of fathers, but that shall be so farre as they cōfirme their sayinges by the euident witnessinges of the Scriptures, the whiche as treulie sayeth Saint Augustine in

his bookes of Christian doctrine, be so tempered with the holy Spirit, yt that whiche is darkly spoken in one place is moste clearelie spoken in an other place, with diuers other meanes to vnderstand well the Scripture, whiche be conteined in ye said bookes of Saint Augustine and of otheres whiche haue entreated of this mater.
            And there remayneth as yet one difficultie to be resolued,

But if this might take place, I pray you my Lordes, what a doore should there be opened to set forth all maner of dreames and rauinges, that men list? And in very dede we see that this haeth

Surely Saint Iohn speaketh not so of the Scriptures, where he sayeth that the thinges yt he haeth written be written to the end, that in beleuing that Iesus is the Christe, the Sonne of God, ye might haue lyfe, the whiche thing should be fals, if there should be left out any doctrine necessarie vnto saluation. Saint Paule also declarīg the vse of the Scripture, where he wold teache all the ministers of the Churche of God, in the personne of his faithfull disciple Timothee,2.

And yet we doubt not but alweys there

might haue bene of the Apostles traditions vnwritten. But what were they? Perteining vnto ordre and to policie. But because this name haeth bene abused a long tyme, it behoueth to shew whiche be ye Apostolicall traditions, the wc will not be hard to be done, if two pointes be propounded whereby they may be iudged,

                that is to say if they be cō
               formable to the doctrine, and mete to edification, for it is a thing moste assured that the Apostles neuer appointed any maner of doing, that might be directly or vndirectly cō
               trarie to the doctrine, whiche they taught, nor also that myght turne away men how litle soeuer it be, frōe the spirituall seruice, seing all their writinges beare witnes thereof. When therefore, this ruell shalbe kept, then shall it be easie to discerne

the doctrine frome the tradicions, and the fals tradicions from ye right traditions. And to this may be added that, that whiche the Apostles them selues haue done, in this behalf, is not alweys perpetuall. Not but that they are witnes wtout reproche, but for this cause, that according to the reule of charitie did they beare some thing with the infirmitie of the Iewes,Act. 29. and so muste be iudged of that whiche they ordeyned of thinges strangled & to eat no blood. And of that whiche S. Paule haeth taught and practised in Timothee and on his personne, the wc thinges now might haue no place, except in following ye generall reule to cōmodate oure selues to oure neighboures in thinges indifferent,

            All these thinges therefore oght to be considered before yt we should grounde a doctrine as Apostolicall for to abuse the authoritie or custom of ye Apostles, to trooble the Churches with, lyke as we see that it haeth come to passe shortly after the tyme of the Apostles: for the feast of Easter, & specially in their tyme touching

them whiche abused the authoritie of the Churche of Ierusalem, for to mingle the Iudaisme with the Christianisme accordīg as it is written in the historie of the Actes of the Apostles.

                How thē may we esteme that ye Apostles haue inuented so many and so many ceremōes (vnto whiche afterwardes haeth bene attributed bothe remission of sinnes and merites) seing yt they haue made suche an expresse protestation to the contrarie, yea & wolde not giue place vnto the Mosaicall ceremonies, of whiche God him self was author? It is a long tyme since that Saint Augustīe cō
               playned hereof, when he wrote to Ianuarius, but there is no doubte if he had bene in the lyke tyme as

ours is, he wold haue bene more astonied at them. In a somme therefor, we do require that the Scripture, whiche is cleare in this behalf, may discerne betuixt the traditions that be good & thē yt be euill, betuixt them that be holie and them that be profaine, betuixt them that be profitable and them that be noysome, and betuixt them that be nedefull & them that are superfluouse.
            These pointes being resolued, it is easie to decyde this question, if the Churche be aboue the Scripture, the whiche semeth to me to be so foolish a question as if one asked whether the infant or childe were aboue his father,

will escaip condemnation. And it serueth to no purpose to say that the Churche was before the Scripture. For althogh that so it be, yet it is so that this worde that afterwardes haeth bene written is alweys more ancient seinge that by the same the Churche hath bene conceiued,

But here must ye cōsider that Saint Augustine speaketh of him self as a Manicheen.

he know it in so great a confusion of suche semblance or liknes: also why is it that in ye tyme then,

And if we should haue signed, what shoulde ye gaine or winne thereby?

                Further it must be knowen if my Lorde Cardinall of him self (the whiche neuertheles we will not presume, but desyre that we may haue witnessing thereof) or els of the authoritie of my Lordes the Prelates, haeth propounded here ye confession of Ausburgh, & to giue vs thereof suche assurāce that we may frely conferre together.
