Again, the Church discouereth the collusion of the deuil from the working of God, by noting the meanes that are vsed in the purchasing of these miracles, which are nothing els, but most serious prayer vnto almightie God▪

            THE TRANSLATOR TO THE CHRISTIAN Reader.
            
               THERE is a certain foul fault (gentle Reader) for which we Catholikes are very ordinarilie and odiously reproched, which is, that we are passing light and exceedingly prone to beleeue euery fable: and vpon this blynd simplicitie easilie drawne into any superstition and error touching the worship of God. The reason whereof is held to be our ignorance in the word of God, and the litle sight we haue in the holy Bible: rather harkening to the traditions of men (as is the phrase) and to the voice of the Church, then in marcking what the writē woord teacheth vs. It is very certaine that Catholikes say with the RoyalPs l. 77. vvh

we are so vngrounded and vnreasonable, as they imagyn.

            It is a sure and certaine veritie which the Catholik churche alwayes confesseth, that God is in euery place: for so he himself hathHierem. 23. avouched, that he filleth both heauen and earth, and therefore there is no place where in he may not be honoured and called vpon.

            The reason of which doctrin (yf thou markeThe ground and reason of al these pointes. wel curteoꝰ reader) cōsisteth in these poincts? First, to worship and honour God for himself, as being the Fountaine of all goodnes: then his saincts, for that he hath imparted and deriued vnto them the abundance of his vnspeakeable graces and glorie: & so the images of them both are to be worshiped as their representations, and for that they notably apertaine vnto them: and thus consequently Catholiks do very wel if for the honour of God and of his Saincts, they discreetely and

orderly loue, and reuerence any thing that concerneth them. Which honour and reuerence as they may professe with their mouthes, or by their wordes, so may they manifest the same accordingly and in the same degree, by their outward gestures and actions. For which cause they are much to be blamed who blame the deuotions of Catholiks, for honouring the Reliques of Saincts, or such things as belong vnto them, or to their very images. As we see the good deuout Catholiks here, for the honour they beare to God, to worship his worthie Mother and for her worship, they reuerence her Image: & for the reuerence of her Image, they beare also a reuerent esteeme of the very wood of the tree wherein the said Image was placed. Acording to that which is recorded in Exodus: where the

            A certaine pamphlet in flemmish came of late to our handes printed and composed (as it seemeth) by seme pernicious Caluinist of Holland against the honour donne to the Moother of God at Mountaigue. In which pamphlet he writeth execrable blasphemies, he forgeth fables & lyes against those of the Church, he basely scosseth at the pi

must ly trodden vnder the feet of this woman, together with the old serpent their head and captaine.
            And in vaine shal their labor bee that endeuour to hinder the Sunne to giue his light vnto the earth, the will of our Lord beeing such as the truth shall clerelie be seene, and pterce through the most obscure and duskie clowdes of heresies, Farre more proffitable therefore and holesome would it be for them to open the windowes of their hartes and to let these diuine beames enter in. And what beames can be more cleere or of more force, then these so palpable arguments & euident demonstrations of the pure & sincere veritie. Doe not these (I beseeche you) so apparent miracles crie out the verie same that our Sauiour speaketh in the ghospel? If you beleeue not me, beleeue the woorks which I doe. And that which the Parents of the blynd man sayd. Enquire of him, he is of age, he will answere for him-self, he is thirtie yeares old.
            
            These corrupters of the truth think to abuse the simple people, telling them that Catholikes woorship Idols, and that they honour the virgin Marie as if she were a goddesse, and adore Images: but this is an old song so often by them chaunted, so often disputed, and in such sorte refuted

                who knoweth not the blessed virgin to be honored as a Patronesse and Aduocate to her Sonne and not as a Goddesse, and that the honor donne to her Image hath relation to her person and not to ber Image. And m

               er that all manner of adoration whether it be Latria, Dulia, or Hyperdulia must not be taken or vnderstood according to the outward woork & apparence but according to the intention of the partie from whome it proceedeth.
            After an other sorte this may in like manner be proffitable to Catholikes. for somuch as there are some amongst them who seeme to doubt of these miracles, for diuersmen by a certaine kynd of incredulitte, and others vpon a spirit of contradiction either deny that these are miracles, or they will not beleeue, that they haue verely bene wrought. Vnto these wee must say that which our Sauiour sayd vnto Sainct Thomas. Come and feele &c. Yf they will not yeeld credit to that which wee set downe, let them goe and see, and feele with their fingers, or else enquire the veritie of those who haue bene cured, for I am assured they shall fynd good store of them. And if after this they will not yet beleeue, assure your selues (as Aristotle sayd of those that denyed the principles of sciences) that they

do it for want of witte and iudgement, or els it must be beaten into their braynes with beetles or bastinadoes.
            There are also others who take occasion to doubt hereof, because many hauing bene miraculously cured, did not for all that obtaine their health at an instant, or at the verie place, but by litle and litle with some alteration of their bodies: vnto whome wee may by good reason answere, that to prooue a miracle it suffiseth that the operation and effect be aboue the course of nature, and not by any naturall meanes or remedies: and such are all those miracles which here in this historie wee haue sette downe.
            Moreouer amongst these miracles some are more perfit and notable then some others are: amongst the more notable are esteemed those, when the diseases are cured at the verie same instant, whereof wee haue verie many, and yet the others are not without miracle, although they haue hapned in successe of tyme, because they were wrought aboue the course of nature.
            For who is he that will or can deny that whē our Lord cured the blynd man it was a true and perfit miracle? who at the beginning saw men walke like trees, yet no man doubteth that he afterward receiued his perfit sight.
            Neither is it any wayes repugnant to the nature

of a miracle that at the tyme of their healing they feel a change or alteration either in their soules or in their bodies: for (not alleaging the other reasons which wee will set downe in the ensuing historie) who is he that knoweth of those whome our Lord & his saints miraculously cured did not feel the like also in them selues? No author nor wryter denieth or affirmeth that they were restored to their health without such alterations. And for so much as those miracles were wrought principalli
                  •
                for the confirmation of our faith, it suffi
                  •
               ed only to set downe the bare truth without further expressing the circumstances, or what other thinges els therin occurred. Our Lord recounted his miracles to the disciples of S. Iohn Baptist (who doubted whether he were the true Messias or no) without making any mention of the circūstance▪ or other qualities, saying: Go, tell vnto Iohn. The blynde see, the lame vvalk, the deaf heare, the leprous are made cleane, giuing vs therby to vnderstand that such cures (although he had sayd nothing) yeelded certaine & infallible proof that he was the true Messias. And whē wee heare, see, and feel the like to be donne by the merits & intercession of the glorious mother of God at the Mountaine of Mountaigue, who is hee that is so wilfully blynd as will not acknowlege the holy

Catholike Romaine Church adorned and honored with such signes & miracles, to be the only spouse of Christ, the doue and beloued of our Lord, the fortresse and piller of truthe, in whoms onlie true and perfit miracles are to be found?
            Awake therefore (O you misledde 
                  •
               ith heresies) open the eyes of your vnderstanding, and behold the light wherwith the God of mercies vou

            And you faithful Catholikes who for the prosperitie of our enemies, or euill successe of the affaires of our religion, or for the abuses and imperfectiō in the life & māners of those of the Church or layetie, are wont to stagger or be faint-harted, confirme and settle your selues hereby: you are in S.

               THE THIRD CHAPTER.
               BVT amongst all, that is very wounderful which wee see and heare to happen daylie at the place of Mountaigue nere to the towne of Sichē, in the Duchie of Brabant, beeing of such importance & admiratiō that through the fame therof within the space of six or seauē mōthes many thousandes of Pilgrims from all partes haue resorted thither. And to the

end that in a matter so latelie knowne & in such abundance of miracles amongst the bruite of so-many incertainties, the truth may perfitly be seene, wee haue resolued to make here a particuler and faithful rehersall of such thinges as hitherto haue come to our knowlege, aswel concerning the p

                  ace & the Image as of the miracles. Which haue hapned, according to the informations gathered by the authoritie of the right Reuerend lord the Archbishop of Mecklin, howbeit through the diuersities of times and distance of places wherin the persons dwel vnto whome God hath imparted his fauours, it hath bene impossible to come to the perfit knowlege of ech thing that hath befa

                  ne them, which notwithstanding wee hope may be discouered in time, & come to light, whereof as yet we haue no knowlege, partly through the negligence or simplicitie of such as haue experimented them in them selues, & partly for that many are (perhaps) ashamed to publish their secret accidentes & maladies, although they haue bene miraculously cured therof.
            
            
               
               THE FOVRTH CHAPTER.
               BVT before wee proceed any furthes it wil not be impertinent (considering in this affaire the great prouidēce and goodnes of God) to examine a litle the particuler circumstances of the place, of the Image, & of other thinges appertaning to this matter. It is a thing much to be noted, that seeing in many rich and mightie Cities & other places of strength in these low Countreis, there are many statelie Churches dedicated to the glorious Virgin Marie, and that she hath in so many places her Images in gold & siluer, and painted or carued with great art and woorkmanship, yet notwithstanding our Lord God (who is the greatnes of the humble) & our blessed Lady the mother o

Moreouer the said towne had about twelue or thirteene hundreth Burgeses, many of them were welthy and all of competent meanes and abilitie, where at this present it is hard to fynd 300. soules therin, or in the places which are dependant of the same, and all those are so needie and low brought that there is not one of them of that abilitie as to entertaine his friend with a decent lodging.
               This towne here-to-fore had many faire houses built with brick and now they are all made with mudde, & thatched with straw in forme of a village,

which is no wounder yf you consider what the towne hath sustained during these troubles and ciuil garboiles.

Not many yeares after, it was taken againe, sometymes by the rebells, sometymes by the kinges people. It was six times spoiled, and once consumed euen to ashes. Besides all this it was grieuouslie afflicted with the plague & wholie deuowred and eaten vp with the great garrisons which lay therin continually. And not onlie the Citie, but the Countrey round about was brought to such desolation by the ranging vp and downe of souldiers theeues and murderers, that the Countrey, (for some myles) is so pestred with woods, hedges, and bushes, that it is not onlie not habitable, but also

trauailers cā scarcelie fynd any way or passage thereunto, in such sort as I am perswaded that there is no one place in all these low Count eis which hath endured so many miseries calamities and aduersi

                  Euen so wee verilie hope that by these fauours and miracles, the diuine bountie of God hath giuen vs to vnderstand that he being moued with pitie & compassion vpon these poor low Countreis, wil take away very soon the scourge of his ire and indignation, to the end that wee should not think our selues wholly by him abandoned through the throng of so many oppressions and miseries, and therefore he sendeth vs now these tokens and presages of some deliuerance neer at hand.
               The other reason may be that those holy Saints which haue dwelt and bene borne in this Countrey, and specially in Brabant haue by their merits and prayers obtained this grace of God that this place which they whiles they liued had in their possession as their inheritance and patrimony wherin they were wont to serue his diuine maiestie, or vnto which they vsed to resort, being deliuered from the furie of heretikes should be one day honored with so great miracles.

Vpon this place (beeing a hil somewhat higher then the rest of the ground lying nere therunto) grew an old Oke, which was somewhat great, wherunto a certaine Image of our lady was fastened, and there is a certaine report and old tradition amongst those people which liue in that quarter, that a hundreth yeares and more sithēce, there was a certaine Shepherd who feeding his flock along that Mountaigne fownd the fore said Image of our Lady lying on the grownd, the which he determined to cary home with him, but the Image miraculously became so heauy that he was neither able to cary it, nor to lift it, yea himself became so immoueable that he had no power to stirre out of the place, in such sorte as he could not driue his f

                  ok homeward. The farmer his Maister much woundring at his Shepherds vnaccustomed lingring, went himself to seek him, And hauing vnderstood the cause

of his stay, perceaued forthwith that the Image which the Shepherd mēt to haue caried home, was the

                  ame Image which men vsed to honor at the Oke of Mountaigue. Wherefore he took it and without any empeschment or resistance placed it againe in the Oke. And the Shepherd as though he had bene vnloosed and vn

By the report of this miracle, the people that neighboured thereabout being excited to deuotion, began to yeeld reuerence to the place and Image, & repaired thether very often to craue help of the blessed virgin, especialy against agues.

               THE TENTH CHAPTER.
               IT is certaine and wel knowne that the foresaid Image remayned in the Oke vntil the yeare 1580, but shortlie after and till the yeare 1587. was no Image at all in that place, as wee fynd by

How this first Image was lost wee yet know no certainty, but it is coniectured that it was destroyed by heretikes who from the yeare 1578 vntil the yeare 1586. ranged daylie in those partes pilling

and spoyling the Countrey.

raigning in those parts wherof very many found amendment. In which litle Chappel the said Image remayned vntil such tyme as it was placed in the new Chappel which now is built of stone.
            
            
               THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER.
               LEt vs now therefore speak of the miraculous and liberal cures which our lord hath vouchsafed to woork vpon those that haue honoured his blessed mother in this place.
               From tyme out of mynd the people & inhabitants of Sichen & places therabout, were wont to fynd singuler help by our Lady at Mountague so often as they found themselues attainted of any agues.
               Of which thing Sir Godsrey of Thienwincle Curat of S. Eustace in Sichen, doth sufficiently testify: who remēbreth that (fifty yeares past) he being then about six yeares old, was caried by his parents to Moūtague, where he was cured of an ague which he had at that time,
               Also at such tyme as the Spanish souldiers were in mutiny in the towne of Diest and that theyr Captains remayned

in the towne of Sichen attending whyles the sayd souldiors were payd, there was a certaine Spanish Captaine lodged in a Burgeise hows who was sick of an ague for the space of a whole yeare, and by reason of his sicknes was so wayward & troublesome as none could cōtent him. It came to passe that the good wife of the hows told him that if he desired to be freed of his ague, it were good he should visit our lady at Mountague, seeing so many were there cu

                  sion of his owne seruants, he went thither, & accomplishing there his deuotion, was there cured, and wholy deliuered of his ague, behauing himself afterwards so modestly and peaceably as he seemed to haue altered his nature.
               Moreouer as the whole towne of Sichen can testifie, there is scarce therein one houshold wherof some one or other hath not receaued help at Mountague. The Curate and escheuins of Sichen affirme assuredly that in the yere 1598 at what time the Irish of the regimēt of Sir VViliam Stanley Coronel, were lodged there, many of thē were wont to vse no other

phisik or remedy for their diseases, but to make their prayers at the foresaid place of Mountague, amongst whome very many were healed, in such forte that Father VValter Talbo

                   an Irish priest, one of the societie of Iesus (who at that tyme was their preachet and ghostlie father) was wont oftentimes to say with great admiratiō that this place was in very singuler manner chosen by God to aduance there his Mothers honour, for which cause he was moued to go thither sometymesdenoutly in procession, accōpained with the said Irish and the townesmen of Sichen. Wherof he wrote to Father Thomas Salius, who was the Superior of the fathers of the societie, which attended vpō the Catholik kings army in the low Countries. Many also affirme that the like cures haue hapned to diuers souldiers of other nations, which came thether in pilgrimage both of the garrison of Diest and Sichen. And some are of opiniō, that the bruite and fame of Moūtague was principally diuulged by the same souldiers, in other Cities and places vnto which they repaired.

For in the beginning of the month of October in the yeare 1603. there were reckned vp, to the number of 135.

                        . sometyme soldier, and launcier vnder the Lord of Grobbendonck in the Country of Brabant, in the yeare 1602. being at Dust had a great defluction of humors, which fel vpon her eyes, and a great and vehement grief insued thereupō as if her eyes had ben gnawne with some vermin: which increaced so much that she vtterly lost her sight: notwithstanding

that many medicines were applyed vnto her both by the aduise of surgeons, as others, of which she receiued no help at all: in such sorte that she could not see or decerne any thing in the world which continued more then eight or ten dayes. At which tyme a certaine womā seeing her in this plight, aduised her to goe vnto our Ladie at Montaigu where many had ben cured of their agues, hoping that there she should fynd some help for her disease. Moreouer she counselled her to wash her eyes with the water which is behynd the Chappel of the foresayd Montaigu. Whereupon the sayd Petronel resolued to goe thither in pilgrimage, and hauing sought out a woman in Diest to leade her, shee walked (starck blynd) towards the said Montaigu about the Moneth of May or, Iune, in the sayd yeare 1602: but assoone as shee began to goe vp the hil towards the chappel, she felt the accustomed griefs of her eyes to be much asswaged, & with all her self to be much inwardly comforted. Which alteration after shee had perceiued, shee would needes trye whether shee had recouered any thing of

her sight or no, so that with her fingers lifting vp her eyelids, shee perceiued that shee began to see (as it were through an obscure mist) the grasse and bushes of the Mountayne, and a little afterwards setting somewhat forwards, shee perfectly sawe the little chappel of wood where the Image of our Ladie was placed, and hereupon▪ shee spake to the woman which led her, and thancking her for her paynes told her that shee needed her help no longer, for that shee had nowe recouered her sight: and so the sayd Petronel went alone without any other ayd towards the foresayd water, where hauing washt her eyes, shee fel to her deuotions in the Chappel of our Ladye, rendring thancks to God and her, for this worck of mercie: and so returning whole and merrie to her hows at Diest hath euer since inioyed perfectly her sight, and hath been free from al her former paynes, and yet so remayneth to this present day, as it appeared vpon the six and twentith of Iune in the yeare 1604. when in the citye of Bruxelles before the Magistrates there by solemn othe shee affirmed all that hath been sayd, conformable

                  How an old man was healed of a great rupture
                  
                     DAniel Smith Sextane of the parish church of the town of Viluord, neer vnto Bruxelles, beeing threescore & seuē yeares old, was some twenty yeares before brokē on the right syde of his belly, as big as both ones fistes, which happened as he thought by rīging the belles of that Church. For the remedying whereof, he did onlie

fitt for the purpose: yet for all that he felt very often such vehement paine, that he thought he should haue lost his sences, & in this manner he went vp and down with great difficultie. But about the moneth of August 160
                        •
                     , he was seased vpon with a long and grieuous disease, where by he thought he should fall into a dropfie beeing very feeble, hauing no appetite to his meat, and vnable to do any thing without great paine and trauaile, which continued a whole moneth space. In which tyme his wyfe hauing hard talk of the miracles which by the intercession of our Ladie were wrought at Montaigu, she resolued to goe thither, and to pray there for her husbāds recouerie, or at least for the mittigatiō of his paines, and especially of his Rupture, where with he was so cruelly tormented: the which she performed not long after. Beeing thē come to Montaigu, vpon an euening at the tyme of Salue, this Daniel beeing in the Church at Viluord, told certain persons that were neere vnto him, that he felt himself at that very tyme much eased of his malladie, which had continued now a whole moneth as hath been sayd: & that

But his wyfe beeig returned from Montaigu, he enquired of her at what tyme and hower she did her deuotiō at the Chappel of our Ladie, and he vncerstood that it was in the euening about fiue of the clock, at the same tyme & instant that he found himself

                        tzelman, sometyme Captaine of a companie of foot, in the seruice of his catholike maiestie in the low cūtries, induced for two yeares space a great accidēt

in her right leg, wherein there were three open soares, which occupied her whole thigh, from the very top thereof to her knee, half an el in length, and a quarter in breadth, as appeared by the plaisters which she was wount to apply thereūto. Betwixt each of the sores there were twelue holes or issues, which proceeded of certaine cold and sharp humors, that discended thither frō her head: all which happened through the miserie and pouertie which she endured, while shee laboured in the court of Bruxels, for payment of such monny as was due vnto her husband for his seruice. For the curing of these soares she had taken the counsel of diuers, together with diuers remedies which sundrie particuler persones had prescribed her, without makīg her case known to any Phisition or Surgeon, & this vpon too much shame and bashfulnes that withheld her. But when she saw that all which she did profited her nothing, she was in fine constrained to put her self into the hands of some skilful Phisition or Surgeon, for the recouery of her desyred health, and therevpon she intreated M. Peter Paulson a germane

surgeon, and one of the guard to our most gracious Prince and Soueraine the Archduke Albertus, to help her: who took vpon him to cure her, and for this purpose let her blood three or fower tymes, and withall gaue her a purgation, and took her into his hows the better to administer vnto her there the diet: applyīg to her soares all the remedies which according to the arte of surgerie he was able to inuent: yet could he for all his labour effectuate nothing, but onely that her paines were somwhat appeased, and sometymes her soares were shut vp, but they continued so not past a day or two, for foorth with they broke out againe as before, and could neuer be consolidated or strengthned. But at last this gentlewoman hauing hard in Bruxelles, of the miracles which were daylie wrought by the inuocation of the Virgin Marie at Montaigu, she had a great desyre to goe thither vpon deuotion, with hope and trust, that our Ladie would procure her her health: and the same night after that she had made this determinatiō betwixt waking and sleeping, it seemed vnto her that she saw the Image of our Ladie of Montaigu,
                     
with the wood that grew thereabout, & she felt as it were an inward motion and incouragemēt to make the foresayd voyage. Wherevpon the next morning following (which was the xxijth. of September 1603.) she beseeched our Ladie that she might fynd some that would accompany her to Montaigu. And afterwards going to the hows of M. Anne de la Croix her gossip who somedayes before had talked with her about her going to our Ladies, she inquired of her when she purposed to depart: vnto whome the other answered, tha

Gudula in Bruxelles, and soon after they set on forewards in their way towards Louain, and the day following towards Montaigu In the way the sayd Mistris Martha felt so great paine in her leg, and with all she became so wearie, that she thought she should neuer come to the Chappel notwithstāding taking a good courage she went on so wel, that she came to a certaine pathway where (the direct way to

Martha began to feel herself much better, and without paine: whereupon (hauing felt this alteration) she looked vpon her leg, and she perceiued that her soares began to wax whole, in such sorte that taking away the clothes & plaisters which were applyed thereunto, she put them into her maūd: and the next day those that had seen her the day before affirmed, that they perceiued her to be much altered & amended, both in her cullour and coūtenance. And the same day (after she had giuen thācks to God and his holy mother) they returned to Bruxelles, shee feeling in her way

the vilage, by the assistāce of an other wo man, where she was suddainly takē with a vehement & welnigh continual flux: which when the inhabitants of the vilage had vnderstood, they rebuked this Magdalen for lodging so neere the sayd woman, for so much as she was reported to be a witch: wherof this Magdalen was not a little aston shed, & seeing that she was not able to woork any longer, by reason of the grieuousenes of her disease, she returned the next day faire and softly towards Bruxelles, where she indured continually her sayd maladie: notwithstanding hauing a good hope that

long tyme without any intermission, although she had vsed many remedies, both by the aduise of a certaine Doctor of Phisick, as also of an other expert surgeon, who was also very wel seen in Physick, besides the counsells of very many other particuler persons, who had administred vnto her diuers medicines, but all was in vaine and to no purpose. She hauing now sustained this for diuers yeares, hauing euery night and day ordinarily thirtie or fortie stooles, she became exceedingly weake and feeble, not knowing what coūsel to take wherby to help her self: wel at last she remembring that the woman of Berthem which had giuen her the beanes was held for a witch, she therfore purposed to goe vnto her, that she might take away from her the inchauntment (a thing wherein many now a dayes very easily permitt them selues to be abused) but it was told her by those of the village, that not long after the same woman went from thence▪ and that some had vnderstood that she was afterward by order of iustice executed for sorcerie. Afterwards it was repor ted, vnto this Magdalen that neere vnto

the town of Hall in Henault there dwelled a certain man which took vpon him to help those that were be witched: wher vpon she went thither somtymes on foot, somtymes being caried, but he hauing visited & examined her, told her that her grief was incurable, and that she should continue in this sorte all the rest of her lyfe: counseling her notwithstanding to make some offering to our Ladie at Hall and to wash her legges for some nyne dayes with Aqua vitae, the which she did, without any ayd or help thereby, her sayd flux induring stil night & day as before: whereby she became oftentymes so sick, that she was forced to go with crutches, & sometymes in her hows she crept vpō all fower, and for a yeares space she voyded in her stooles cleer blood. At length she was aduised to seek vnto a cer tain woman dwelling in Bruxelles, neer vnto the Court, who was skilful in administering certaine herbes against sorcerie. Who going and declaring vnto her her necessitie, the sayd womā gaue her to drink certain spoonfulles of wyne, with certaine stamped herbes, and with this she returning to her lodging, and coming

heer to the Cloister of the Capuchines, where she dwelt at that tyme, she felt her self very ill and (be it spoken with reuerence) she cast forth by way of vomiting eight little beastes, like vnto myce new littered, hauing tailes & very litle hair on their backs, & beeing alyue. And a day or two after she took againe of the former herbes, but then she voyded nothing at all. Hauing at the third tyme receiued again the foresaid drinck, she cast out two little beastes like vnto fishes which liue in the water and are called millers thūbes & withall three or fower thinges lyke other fishes, and finally a great worme lyke a litle snake. After she was deliuered of this filth, she found her self a little eased about her hart, but her flux neuer ceased either by night or by day so that (be it spoken with reuerence) she voided her meat euen in such sort as she did eat it, without any disgestion thereof at all: and so soon as she had eaten or drunk any thing were it neuer so little▪ she was incontinently forced by siege to voyd it. In such wise, that she was constrained to swathe her self as women are wount to do their

little children, that she might gayn her liuing by working in the houses of some of her acquaintance, because the former passion neuer ceased or stayed. And thus she cōtinued with the sayd flux three or fower yeares after she had cast out of her bodie those things before mentioned, without applying any other remedie, for wel she found that she could not any wayes be cured. At the last, in the yeare 1603. after this flux had continued welnigh ten yeares, she was aduised by some of her frendes to make a pilgrimage to our Ladie at Montaigu, in hope that there peraduenture she might recouer her health, seeing that many others were at the same place miraculously cured. The which she determined to do. But hauing vnderstood that the wyfe of Gerard Monck trumpetour to the most gracious Arc

But Magdalen taking the wood, went pre sently to the Church called the Chappel of our Ladie, which was not far from thence, and these putting her self vpon he knees before the altar of the Virgin Marie, she began to gnaw and eat the foresayd piece of wood, deuoutely beseeching the Mother of God that she would obtaine for her her health, and so soon as she had swallowed it, she found her self much eased, feeling in her bodie a certaine heauie grosse matter to descend from her stomack down to the left syde of her belly. In that Church she continued in prayer till she had heard one masse, and a part of an other, at which tyme she perceiued that her former passion ceased, beeing neuer after troubled with her accustomed flux, but onely that she felt the thing that sunck down into

Moreouer they sayd, that they knew how for some eight or ten yeares she was continually aflicted with the flux: during which tyme they had seen her often tymes very sick & weak, & that the cullour of herface

was verie yellow & vgly to behold. And the wyf of this Derick declared that this Magdalen had made the voyage to our Ladies at Montaigu in her companie, in the cōpanie of her husband, & others before mentioned, and she wel remembred, that at such tyme as they aproched neere the Mountaine about the place where the gibet st

All which is to be seen by a publick act made thereof vnder the seale of the sayd Citie, of Bruxels, and subsigned P. Numan.

came from Diest, where he had lodged that night, and he intreated the sayd two Religious women to goe vnto Diest with him, which they did, and there were lodged in the Cloister called Mariendale and two dayes after (to witt vpon the tuisday and weddensday) they returned againe in companie of the sayd Lord Marquis to do their deuotions at Montaigu, the sayd Lord beeing in coache, by reason of his indisposition, and the Religious with him in regard also of her accident, but all the rest of his houshold and companie went on foot, with their prayers and spiritual songs, and other such lyke deuises inciting to deuotion. Some of this companie and amongst others the sayd Religious put themselues in the state of grace, & receiued the holy Communion in our Ladies chappel, and did other their particuler deuotions. Vpō weddensday in the morning whylst the holy seruice of the masse was saying in Montaigu, the sayd Mistris Catharin began to feel a certaine paine neer vnto her left eare, the which begā to passe through all her bodie euen from her head down to her lame leg, but shee knowing not

what this should meane, nor yet much regarding it, she made her prayers to our Lord, more for the good of the Cuntrie, and the weale of her soule, then for the healing of her leg, except it pleased God to increase his glorie thereby.

                     ight vpō her legs, and to walk along her chamber, feeling a marckable stretching and plucking within her hip, and throughout all her left leg: whereat she beeing much amazed, and praysing God for this his fauor and the Glorious Virgin who had prayed for her health (as she now felt

by her own experience) she settled her self to her prayers, intending to perseuer therein all that night: but beeing somwhat weary, both through her iorney as also for that sleep came vpon her, after she had sayd some deuotions she betook her self to her rest. Vpon the next morning rysing out of her bed, she found her self so wel, and in such sorte altered, that she needed no longer her shooe that was vnderlayd, but walked vp-right in the Conuent onely with a paire of pantofles, fynding no more difficultie in setting both her feet on the groūd, the aforesayd stretching from her hip vnto her leg stil continuing not-withstanding that at that tyme the bunche of the sayd hip (which was behynd her and out of the right place) was very much lower and lessened.
                  The Lord Marquis beeing aduertised of this miracle, sent some of his howshold and diuers others who had gone with her on this voyage to visit her, who al found this admirable change in her person, seeing her now vpon the second of Octo

But as people spake much of the miracles which were wrought at Montaigu by the intercession of the glorious Virgin Marie, she was moued thereby to goe thither, in hope and confidence that the blessed Mother of God would pray for her: & so she went by wagon to Montaigu in the forsayd moneth of October, in the cōpanie of Mistris Agatha Reygers with whome she sometymes dwelled with Mistris Margares de Morade Mistris Ioane Iacops & some others▪
                     
and beeing come to the sayd mountaine not without great paine, that night they did in the same place their deuotions, and hauing lodged afterwards in Sichen, the next morning they went on foot to the Chappel of out Ladie, where again they prayed, hard masse, & comunicated, at which very tyme the sayd Magdalen receaued so great ease and amendment, that she found her self deliuered of her old paines and griefes, & altogether altered, in somuch as beeing returned to Bruxelles she could goe and walk whether soeuer she pleased without any impediment or grief, and without any band or trusse, feeling the sayd peece of flesh to be wholy retired within her bodie. Vpon the xviijth^ of Nouēber in the same yeare 1603 she went again vnto Montaigu, with an other companie, there to render thancks to God and his holy mother, and offered vp there one of her bands which she was accustomed to weare, and although in this last iorney shee had gon fiue duitche myles on foot, yet for all that she felt no paine or appearance of her former grief, beeing whole & sound as shee is at this present. All the aforesayd things this

                     Magdalen declared and auouched solēnly vnder her othe, before the Magistrates of Bruxelles vpon the nyne and twentith of March in the yeare 1604. Vpon which day the foresayd Mistris Agatha Reygers and Mistris Margarit de Merode making also their appearance before the sayd Magistrates, declared and affirmed that they knew very wel that this Magdalen had indured this accidēt for three yeares space, or there about, & how that after she had made the first voyage to Montaigu she remained perfectly whole, & in good disposition of her bodie, which wel they might perceiue and know, forsomuch as the sayd Magdalen came often to their howses, because she had been seruant vnto Mistris Agatha, as hath been sayd. And vpō the seuenth of April following, Anne vā Suick Beghine dwelling in Bruxelles, and there for xxv. yeares practising the arte of surgerie appeared before thesayd magistrates, who vnder the like othe, declared and assured that she had in cure this Magdalen, but she could not help her: shewing moreouer how at the same tyme (through the assistance of God) she had healed many wounderful diseases

and accidents, but she held that (which this Magdalen had) hardly euer to be cured by any naturall meanes or work of man. And al this that hath been sayd, is to be seen by an instrument and Act which passed before the Magistrates of Bruxelles as wel vpon the foresayd nyne & twētith of March, as vpon the seuenth of April 1604, subscribed P. Numan Secretarie, and signed with the seale of the sayd Citie.

                  How a Religious woman was cured of the Cancker.
                  SIster Margarit vāden Perre born in Antwerp
                     In Oct. 1601. and there professed a lay sister in the Cloister of the third order of S. Francis, beeing thirtie yeares old, had the cancker in her brestes, for the space of fower moneths, as diuers Phisitions and Surgeons iudged, who had her in cure: to witt, two men, and two women, and yet she could not fynd any help for all their labor: yea on the cōtrarie her euil waxed dayly greater and wors: in such sorte that all those that visited her sayd plainely that it was incurable, for that the patient had her brestes as hard as a stone, reddish, blewish, and so vgly that it was a grieuous thing to behold them. Her right pap was swoln euen vnto her arme-pit and from thence her grief passed vnto her back, where it seemed that it would haue burst out. Vnder the other pap was a great swel ling,

and out of her nip
                        ••
                     es issued somtymes a certaine kynd of matter, somtymes verie blood, and so it did somtymes also out of her eares. Thus the poor Religious woman was so full of paine, and in so miserable an estate, that for a whole yeares space before her cure she was not able to doe any manner of woork, neither could shee ly, but was cō
                     strained to sleep sitting, & that with very great paine: and sometymes one of her armes became so stiff that she could not lift it to her head. And to be healed of this accidēt shee repaired to a skilful woman called Magdalen, dwelling in the Brestraet in the sayd Citie of Antwerp: who for the space of some six moneths took in hand to cure her, applying certaine plaisters of herbes vnto her: but whē in steed of helping her she became wors, she left that cunning woman, and vsed a certain plaister which a famous Surgeon dwelling the town of Harentals called M. Peter, had prescribed her, who also helping her nothing thereby, & perceiuing her self to be past all hope to be cured, shee left him also. Afterwards an old Portuguez Surgeō, called Vento Rodriguez counseled her

to make an issue in her arme, to draw out thereby the humor of the canker: but all was in vaine, and to no profit at all. After that again she applyed diuers remedies which some of her neighbours & freinds taught her, but without any further successe. After a certain tyme she permitted that her brestes might be visited by an elderlie mayd, who exercised her self in surgerie called Anne Cammarts, alias A

At the last she shewed her impediment again to an other cunning woman called Gertrude Munters, who foūd that the canker was not onely in both her breastes, but that it had passed euen vnto her back, where also shee felt a great hardnes: and this woman did nothing els to her but rub her back with a certain kind of ointmēt, which shee could hardly

his bellie, & this hapned him when he was but six weekes old, so that from that tyme they made him weare a trusse, because the sayd rupture appeared of the bignes of a turkeys egge, & neuer kept in, but whē they put on his trusse: & oftē tymes it was seen in his secret partes, whereby he indured great pain, especially twise or thrise euery moneth at the change of the moone. And although his mother had applied diuers medicines both by the aduise of some surgeons as of others, yet she nothing preuailed.

Whereupon shee left there his trusse in memorie thereof: and beeing come home shee perceiued that his rupture appeared again but after that tyme her

and her superiours commaundment. In such sorte, that she was forced to vse the counsel first of Doctor Vilerius, and afterwards continually of Doctor Fienus both professors of Physick in the Vniuersitie of Louain. But for all that they had prescribed her receiptes at diuers tymes, yet she found no profit or ease thereby. Whereupon hauing now for two moneths space left all vse of Physick, she determined to go and pray three tymes at the Chappel which they had accomodated in their garden, in the honour of our ladie, and in memorie of the miracles which by her intercession were wrought at Montaigu: with a desyre to haue done the same in the place it self yf it might haue been permitted her. Going therefore to the sayd Chappel, with great paine & labor, vpon a saterday beeing the xvth. of Nouember in the sayd yeare 1603: & hauing there dō
                     ne her deuotiō, she began to feel a great ease and alteration in her bodie, recouering a notable force & ablenes in her self, in so much that on the same day she did read the mattines of our Ladie on her knees, which for fiue moneths before she was not able to do. On the night following

she beeing in the quier with the rest of the religious, & reading her howers, at the very instant that mattines was ended by the song of Salue Regina, the sayd Sister Michielle felt as it were a hād vpon her shoulder which seemed to haue pressed her down, & this was in so euident a manner that she felt & perfectly discerned the very fingers; whereby she started, & looked back to see the person that touched her. After Mattines she went to repose her, and rysing again in the morning she found herself meruelously amended, & so strong, that immediately after, she went to the Churche to be present at diuine seruice with the rest of the Religious, with whome she sung so lowd & liuely that they were greatly astonished thereat, not knowing what voice it was that sounded so shrill. And from that tyme afterwards she hath remained healthie, & in good plight, singing and assisting at the ordinarie obseruances as the other Religious: who a

the sayd Conuent haue giuen attestation & certified vnder their seales, that all this is true that hath been here related. Likewise the sayd religious hath also affirmed the same in the hands of the Reuerend Father Antonie de Bergaigne their ghostly father, vpon the twentith of Ianuarte 1604, and after that again in the presence of the Magistrates of the sayd Citie of Louain vpon the xvj. of March in the sayd yeare 1604. Vpon which day also the sayd Superiour Sister Clare van Leyden appearing before the same Magistrates, declared that she knew very wel that the sayd Religious was so long tyme sick, and in the aforesayd plight, as hauing seen it partly with her own eyes, and partly hauing vnderstood somuch from the sayd Religious herself, as it is to be seen by the attestation subsigned R. de Prince Secretarie, and sealed with the seale of the same Citie.

In so-much that they could not past twyse or thryse in a yeare take her out of her bed: and yet euery tyme she would fall into such qualmes & fayntings that they thought she would haue dyed, and at one tyme amongst others beeing taken out of her bed, and layd vpon an other on the ground, vntil such tyme as her owne was made redie, shee became so feeble by this touching and remouing her, that they were forced to let her so ly

Yea, which is more, yf any did but onely touch the bed wherein she did ly, or so much as the curtaines, she took such an apprehension thereof, that she sowned incontinently, and for this cause, they remooued her out of her bed but twise or thryse in a yeare, as we haue declared.
                  And the Religious women that attended her were constrained to put good store of thornes round about the pillers of her bed to the end that none might touche it whereby the patient might not fall into her strange swownings. And it is

to be noted, that for the space of s

Again for these six yeares this poor religious person had vsed the counsel and help of many Physitions, and had tryed many medicines, receiptes, and remedies, which rather made her wors then better: in so much as the Phisitions plainely affirmed that they knew not how to help her. Some sower yeares before she was cured they made her an yssue, and they thrust a great red whote pack needle through the skin of her left side, drawing through the same a corde made of silk, the which (for the space of three moneths) they drew dayly vp and down to make a way, through the which the bad humors might passe: and although hereby she suffered much paine, yet it profited her nothing at all: yea she rather felt her self woors then before. Now this Religious seeing there was no hope in man, she armed her self with patience the best

she could, and she had for some yeares before vpon deuotion determined that when she had thus lyen seuen yeares, she would either visit or cause some to visit our Ladie of Hanswyck in the citie of Maclin, in hope by way of prayer to obtaine her health.

After the masse was sayd he went vnto the sick person, and declared vnto her his intention: the which when she had heard, she was inwardly altered, and seemed to be exceedingly glad thereof, as the sayd M. Batson wel perceiued: whereby he felt him self the more incited to accomplish thesayd promesse. Vpon this resolution he departed from Antwerp with Sir Vulmar

Beeing at Montaigu vpon the third of December, in the sayd yeare 1603. which was the eue of S. Barbara, they both calebrated masse in the Chappel of our Ladie, and prayed vnto allmightie God by the intercession of his holy Mother to vouchsafe to

restore this poor and miserable Religious woman to her health. Vpon the self same day that the holy sacrifice was there offered for her, the sayd Religious womā beeing in Antwerp in her bed felt her self to be much amended, and to haue obtained a new strength, and immediately afterwards she felt so great payne in her bodie, that she fell into an ague. The next day (beeing the feast of S. Barbara) at eleuen of the clock about noon she began again to feel her strength much to increase, and she spake to the Sister that kept her that she would reache vnto her her hād, which when she had taken, she raysed vp her self by her self, vpon her feet vpon her bed: whereat the sister beeing much astonished cryed out for feare, and the sayd Religious fel down heauily again vpon her bed, not sustaining for all this any alteration or faintnes hereby, whereas before she was woūt to fal into sowning and that almost to death, when any did so much as but touch her, yea although it were neuer so softly, as hath been sayd.

she was strong enough to walk vp and down her chamber. But vpon the next day following which was fryday & the fifth of the aforesayd moneth of December, she craued to haue her apparell deliuered vnto her, which was giuen her, and she put it on alone by her self without any to help her, beginning first with her left arme, on which syde all her disease had been, which arme none might touch before, no more then any other part of her bodie without the daunger of falling into her accustomed faintenes: and so hauing apparailed herself shee came cheerefully out of her bed: and signing her self with the signe of the crosse, down she cast herself vpon her knees, & lifting vp her eyes to heauen, she gaue thancks to our Lord and sayd: Praise be to the O Mari

Cā he restore the sight to the blynde? the hearing to the deaf? is he able to cure the afflicted with the palsey? in a momēt to make the canckers, botches, and other incurable diseases to vanish away? Hath he the power to creat new limmes, flesh and blood in the bodies of creatures? as you may see in the cure of the lame youth of three and twenty yeares old, who had no legges to walk vpon. Truly yf his power could reach vnto this, he had dōne it many ages ago, and so the true miracles of our Sauiour

and of his Apostles should haue had no force to woork the conuersion of the Gentils, but all would haue been turned into vanitie and ridiculous foolerie, when the deuil should haue donne as much for his own parte, as Christ and his Apostles had donne for their doctrine, that so the world should not haue been conuerted, which he held vnder his tyrannicall yoke. No it is too grosse an error to haue such a cogitation, and it maketh that miserable damned creature equal to the souerain God of heauen. And what commoditie could this sworn enimie of mankynd draw out of this his proceedings: Is it lykely that he wil do any thing whereby the world should be incited the more to honour and serue God; beare reuerence to the Virgin Maric: and adict it self to works of vertue and sanctitie? Is there any man in his right wittes that doth beleeue this? It is no other, it is no other (frendes) but the woork and▪ mercie of God, who in these latter dayes amongst so many shelues and rockes of errors setteth before vs a Pharus or Beacon, a light from heauen, a Cynosura or celestial star, an infallible

mark by the stedfast contemplation whereof we are to direct the course of our nauigation in this lyfe, yf we wil not vtterly perish. It appertaineth vnto vs to yeeld him infinit thancks for the same, and in such sorte to frame our liues that he wil vouchsafe to continue & increase towards vs this his mercie, It is your duty (brethren) to open your eyes and to behold the sunne which ryseth so brightly shyning, for yf (notwithstanding all this light) you wil perseuer in the obscure night of your darcknes, you shalbe iudged inexcusable, and are lyke one day to feel the terrible and heauy hand of the Almighty vpon you for the same.

Whereby perceiuing herself past all hope of recouerie by any humaine meanes, she took her recours to almightie God, and to his holy Mother the Virgin Marie, and so in the yeare 1604 she promised to go in pilgrimage to Montaigu, to which place she transported herself within a little whyle after, and there hauing donne her deuotions, she returned

homeward with some more ease the before, howbeit shee was not perfectly cured. But beeing come home to her Conuent, and continuing her deuotions towards the Virgin Marie for some nyne dayes space, settling her hart and intentiō towards the miraculous place of Mōtaigu, vpon the nynthe day (which was in the moneth of August) after dinner, she felt a maruelous and miraculous alteration in her bodie, in so much that she thought shee had as it were a new bodie, & from that instant the sayd flux ceased, and thesayd religious woman remained perfectly whole and cured.

and cheefs of the rebells that vpon a suddaine (and whylst our armie and men of warre were employed in the countie of Flāders both about the taking in of Osted as also in resisting the rebelles who were planted before the town of Scluse) they might go to surpryse, burn, and destroy the Image and Chappel of our Ladie of Montaigu. And so hauing assembled together some eight hundreth or a thowsand hors from the Cities of Breda and Bergues vpon Soam, they came vpō the eue of the Natiuitie of our Ladie, beeing the vijth. of September, 1604. in the night to the banksyde of the riuer of Demere, through the which they hauing waded at a certain place not far from the town of S

                     ow) they thought to haue surprysed the place and al that was therein a little after midnight, before that any should discouer them: but whereas an hower or two before they passed ouer the riuer, those of Montaigu were aduertised of their enterprise, they had opportunitie to saue the miraculous Image, and the best vestures and ornaments of the Chappel.
                  
                     When the Heretikes were arriued at Montaigu they began to belch out infinit blasphemies, & horrible iniurious words against the Mother of God; and casting themselues furiously into the Chappel, they broke the images, pictures & painted tables that remained: they burnt the foormes, chestes, seates of confession, and other thinges that were of wood, and yet the Chappel took no fyer, allthough they laboured to burn it also. And taking no compassion at the teares and waylings of the poor inhabitants, cōsumed with fyer all their, howses cottages and baraques in the moūtayne, they robd certain women (that were come thether in pilgrimage, and had remained there all that night to the end that on the next day they might the better at

And so making their retreat with the glory of so honorable an exployt they passed further within the countrie and so returned into the Campigne and from thence euery one to his own quarter, with smal gayn

and bootie, but yet with the honorable tytle of howsburners, Image-breakers, and persecutors of the Mother of God, and of her who brought vs foorth our aeternal saluation, & who with her own flesh and blood nourished the bodie and flesh of the Sauiour of the world, by which he saued & redeemed vs. A woork which at that great day of iudgement must expect of the soueraine Iudge (who is her sonne) such a guerdon and recompence as any man of iudgment may wel imagin: seeing amōgst mortal men there is none so simple or base mynded that can behold his own mother abused and vnworthelie iniuried without some inward feeling thereof.

deuil gayned (thinck you) by this affront; but onely that the affectiō & deuotion of good Catholiks is grown much greater, and more feruent towards the glorious virgin Mother of God, and that the visitation of this holy place hath been sithēs as much frequented and continued as euer it was before, and that in steed of a few poor little sheddes and cottages now you may see diuers good complete howses. And without all doubt Satan laboureth in vaine to extirpate and root out that which hath been planted by the hand of the Almightie: let him spyte at it, and let him gnash his teeth as much as he wil against it, his mallice shal be turned vpō his own head, and this glorious woman this Ladie whome enough we can not pryze, whome we serue and honour, shal by the holy frute of her womb crush the head both of him and of all his adherents and consortes.

                        mmens: who all by diuers medicines & remedies endeuoured to cure him, but they atchieued no more then the others before: his leg remaning with the former soares, and was very much swoln, so that the patient was forced to go with two crutches. And in this plight he remained for a long tyme, beeing not able to go somuch as one or two steps without his crutches. Whereby being at last brought to that pouertie that he was cō
                     strained to procure his liuing by the almesse of good folk, he was counseled by some to goe vnto the great Hospital of Bruxelles there to be healed and assisted. Where beeing admitted, he continued for some fower moneths and an half, and albeit that he was daylie visited by M. Iohn Bierens sworn Surgeon of the Citie, and by the Religious women of the sayd hospital, yet they could neuer cure him. Whereupon leauing Bruxelles, he went to Antwerp, where he was again in the Hospital for fourteen weekes, and he was assisted and dressed by two Surgeons, whereof the one was called M. Cornelius and the other M. Iohn, & although

both they and the Physitions which visited and frequented him, had vsed all their diligence to heale him, yet they profited nothing, so that all that they did was in vaine. In somuch as beeing out of all hope to be cured, he departed out of the Hospital, and went vp and down a beggig going alwayes with his crutches. Afterwards coming to the Citie of Maclin he put himself into the Hospital to try yf there he could be holpen: where for the space of six weekes he was in the hands of the surgeon of that Hospital, dwelling neere to our Ladies Church, who also spared no paynes to cure him: but all was frutelesse, and procured him no ease, the poor patient continuing stil in the sayd state, hauing his left leg drawn backward, and very crooked, and so stiff, that he thought none was able by any force to make it right again. And so seeing all the remedies that he applyed there vnto did no good, he remained stil lame, not medling any more with phisick or surgerie, saue onely that he took some plaisters now from one, and then from an other to preserue his leg from rotting. It happened that in the beginning of the

yeare 1603. he hard folk tel of the miracles which were wrought at Montaigu through inuocation of our Ladie, whereupon he wēt with his crutches thether from the aforesayd village of Vaels, where he was at that present, and he continued for a certain tyme in the moūtayne, there daylie praying, and yet at that tyme he felt no ease at all. But wheras afterwards he perseuered in going often tymes in pilgrimage to the sayd Montaigu, and in visiting our Ladies Chappel: at the last betwixt Easter and Whit suntyde in the yeare 1604. seiourning for some tyme on the sayd mountayn, and dooing his accustomed deuotions at the Chappel, he also took of the water that is in the sayd place, and daylie washed his leg therewith: wherein he found incontinently amendment, and perceiued that the two soares of his leg (which were now turned into one and w
                        ••
                      as large as both ones hands) began to heale, and by litle and little to decrease. Vpon which euēt beeing to depart from thence, he furnished himself with a good quantitie of that water in a 
                        •
                     ot, where-with he continued to wash his leg as before, and so by litle and litle

the sayd sore was made perfectly whole, and the swelling of his leg went away. And in the beginning of December in thesayd yeare 1604. he came again to Montaigu with his crutches (although he had alredy felt so great ease that he vsed them not) and stayed there vntil the twentith of the sayd moneth, daylie washing his leg in the order as before we haue sayd: & at that tyme it became very right, strōg, and free from the former euil, insomuch that he left his crutches at our Ladies Chappel, going and walking as perfectly as any other: and from thence he went on foot without any paine or grief to the Citie of Bruxelles vpon the xxijth of the same moneth: where before the magistrates of the sayd Citie he affirmed and vnder his othe solemnly auouched the thinges that here haue been declared, as it apeareth by the attestatiō they dispatched heerof, dated the same day, and subsigned, P.

The addition of those miracles which at our Montaigu this last yeare haue been wrought, after due examination are now vnder the printers hands, whereof in tyme (by Gods help) I wil make thee partaker. Meane whyle with the deuout Euangelical woman make thy profit of these which here thou fyndest: and with her not onely inclyne thy hart to beleeue, but also lift vp thy voice to professe and confesse the happines of this sacred Mother,

at whose intercession they are wrought, and withall the infall

Remēber who they were that would haue killed Lazarus, and in deed killed our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ: whome therfore they should haue beleeued and honored, whē they saw by his most doubtles signes the truthe was so manifested and theyr impietie detected. Beware thou turn not with them to the reason of state, and earthly pollicie, saying: Neveniant Romani or such like, thereby diuerting thy self from that which principally thou art bound to regard, least through the iust iudgement of God, that which thou now most fearest apprehend thee, and that which should be thy soueraine obiect, hereafter faile thee. Doost thou not see how our Catholik doctrin by the same powerful hand at this present is vpholden and fostered, by which at the beginning it was planted and took root? Read read, and see Yet for thyn own good I am to increat thee, to auoid all curiositie in thy

reading, as thou seest how I haue auoided it in my translation: endeuouring rather truly then trimly to expresse my Author, as he hath labored purely & punctually to deliuer vs the truthe. Lykewyse be thou careful, not curious in learning the truthe, and Christiāly couragious in confessing the truthe, that in the hower of thy chiefest peril the truthe may deliuer thee.
