            THE PREFACE to THE Reader
            
               YT is well ſayed of the
philoſophers (gētle reader)
a good thinge is
not to be pryſed after
the greatneſſe thereof
but after the goodneſſe. The which
ſayeng well waighed doth moch
ſpeake againſt the peruerſeiud
gements of manymen now adays
which eſteme al thinges by the greatneſſe
and eſpecially bookes ſetfourth
cōcerning religion which
be daily ſet fourthe more and more
to the glorie of God (who be thanked
therfore) and to the profight
of the weake breathren. Thei thī
               ke
in theſe litle bookes is ſmal goodneſſe.
Me thinke ſuche men as

onely thei put in that which is neceſſary
leauing out other trifles
and thoſe bookes I compayre to

               ALmighty God the father
ye ſonne and holy
gooſte are three & one
One in ſubſtaunce
three in parſones Who onely is
vnuiſible & can not be ſene, onely
immenſe & incomprehenſible only
vncircumſcribed onely vnchaungeable
with out bodi and euerlaſting.
Euery where preſent but
hidden euery where whole but yet
with out meaſure.
            Inuiſible becauſe in his ſubſtaunce
he can not be ſene as ye Apoſtle
writeth .i. Timo .vi. whom
no man hathe ſene and in the goſpell.
Iohn .i. no man dyd ſee god
at any time.
            Without body becauſe he hath
no bodely ſhape in him ne is compacte

of any membres as. Iohn
.iiii. god is a ſprete they that adore
hym muſte worſhype hym in
ſprete.
            Immenſus or with out meaſure
For his quantite biggnes greatneſſe
longnes or other his quantityes
or qualitees can not be me
aſured of any creature.
            Vncircumſcript or diſcryueable.
For as moche he cannot be dyſcryued
by any meanes.
            In no place becauſe he ſtireth not
from one place to another.
            Vnchangeable becauſe he cānot
be changed from that he is as he
witneſſeth by the prophet malachie
I am the Lorde and am not
chaunged. The ſame God is called
vnchaungeable becauſe nether
wrath rage repentaunce forgetfulnes
and calling to remembraunce
and other lyke affectyons
can chaunge by any meanes

in his ſubſtaunce.
            He is called immortaul or euerlaſting
in that he cannot die and
whereſoeuer in the ſacred bible ye
holy ſcripture doth aſcribe affections
or motions of the minde or
any partes of mans bodye vnto
God as heade heare eyes & other
lyke theſe and ſuch other are not
to be vnderſtanded if ye wyl vnderſtande
them truly not after ye
letter as the ſtory lieth after wich
ſorte the Iewys aud heritiques
onely wyſe in yearthly thinges,
take it
            Imagening God to haue abody
and to be conteined in a place
            But all thoſe muſte be taken
ſpretuallye and ſo graunted to
be in him. And yf anye man ſuppoſe
that God hathe means membres
and is ledde wythe the affectyones
of the mynde as 
                  〈◊〉
               
be, wythe oute dowbte that men

maketh hym Selfe an Idole or
a falſe GOD in hys owne herte.
            Wherfore when we read a head
gyuen to GOD yt muſte be vnderſtande
in a fygure as I tolde
before wherby is mente the god-head
which was before all thynges
and to which al things ar in
ſubieccion.
            By the heares of hys heade
fyguratyuely muſte bee vnderſtande
the holye aungelles or all
the electe and choſen ſainctes of
GOD. Daniell .vii. I dyd beholde
tyll ſeates were ſet and the
olde aged ſate hym downe hys
clothes were as whyte as ſnowe
the heares of his head like pure
wolle. The ſame is meant by the
whyte clothes or garmentes that
is declared by the whyte heares
that is the holye aungelles and
the greate numbre of Sainctes

all in white.
            GOD is ſaied to haue eyes
in that he ſeeth all thynges and
nothyng is hydden frome hym.
In whoſe ſighte as the Apoſtle
writeth no creature is inuiſyble
hebre .iiii. For all thynges are
open and bare before his eyen in
an other ſorte of ſpeakynge the
eyes of the Lord do ſignefy a reſpect
as ye eyes of ye lord vpō ye iuſt
            Alſo the eyen of the Lorde do
ſignefy miſtycally hys commaundement
whereby is myniſtred
to vs the lyghte of knowledge.
Pſal .xviii. The Commaundement
of the bryght geuyng light

            The heares of the Lords eye
liddes are the ſecrete hydden and
incomprehenſible iudgemēts of
god or by them a ſpiritual phraſe
of ſpeaking in the holy bible is
noted wherof is ſayed in the pſal

the heares of hys Eyelyddes to
aſke the Chyldren of men, trye
theim.
            Eares are gyuen to God becauſe
he heareth al thynges and
nothyng is counceled from him
Sapiencie, i. the care of heauen
heareth all thinges.

Shewe thy face o Lord and we

            God alſo is ſayd lykewiſe to haue

            GOD dothe ſitt not bodelye

the Lorde hathe raigned ouer the

vpon the rubin which is interpreted

            Whan ye read that god commeth
downe in to the worlde therby ye
ſhall vnderſtande that he dothe ſo
me thing amōg men that was not
done before after this ſorte is the
ſonne of god ſaied to haue come
downe when he did take to him a
true mans body of the bleſſed virgin
mary for our ſatuatiō of whoſe
downe cōmyng or incarnation
is writē pſal .xvii. he bowed downe
the heauēs he came downe and a

be ſent his meſſengers the ā

and ꝓphetes to preach his cō
               mīg
to mē a miſt was vnder his fet
in that the vngodly blinded through
ther owne wyckednes coulde
not acknowledge his incarnation
neyther as yet can.
            God is ſaied to ſtand whē he ſufferethe

doo either bi chaungīg of place or

viſibly but inuiſibli by the ſecret &
iuſt iudgement of god.
            God is ſayd to walke not by going
from one place to an other ſo
to beleue is hereſye, but hys walking
is to haue a delyghte in the
hartes of his electe Sainctes as
it is written yet I wyll dwell in
them and walke in thē and I wyl
be theyre lorde or at the leaſtwyſe
the walkynge of God is to goo
from place to place in the Holye
preaching of his goſpell.
            The ſpeache of god is inuiſyble
without the ſound of any voyce
or any other whyſper by putīg

godly what hys wyll is geuynge
them a true vnderſtandīg eyther
by opening to them thinges to come
as to the holye prophetes the
whiche ſpeakinge by the mouthe
of god as ſome wyll haue it is taken
three maner of wayes. The

fyrſte through a creature ſubiecte
as to Moyſes when he appeared
in the buſhe and fyre and to Abraham
or Iacob to whome he
dyd appeare by angells the ſecond
way by dreames as to Jacob
the prophet zachary and Ioſeph
the huſbande of the bleſſed Mary
and other holy men to whome
he would open his ſecrete y• third
was neither by creature that can
be ſene neyther by a dreame but

To ſee of the lorde is to allow ye

god dyd ſee all that he had made

to ſe ī hī is to diſalow ye wickednes

thei kepe mi cōmādemētes or no:
            
               
Not know in god is to refuſe
or reiecte certein caſt awayes and
reprobate parſons Luke .xiii. I
know ye not whence ye are, hence
from me ye that do wickednes.
            God is ſayd to be ialouſe when
he doth chaſtice ſcourge and correct
hys creature whome he wold
not haue perriſſh and therby calleth
him backe to hym againe eyther
is he ſaid to be ialouſe when
he ſuffereth no ſine vnpuniſhed.
God is ſaid likwiſe to be āgry not
by anye mocyon of the mynde or
other perturbacyon whyche can
not chaunce in hym, but becauſe
he doth iuſtlye puniſſhe the wycked
he is ſayde to be angrye that
is to reward them as they haue deſerued
and that is called the vengeaunce
of God his angry wrath
rage or fury.
            GOD is ſayd to repente not
becauſe he is ſorye for anye thing

that he hathe doonne as Menne
are for he that knoweth al thinges
before they be done can not repente
him of anye thynge that he
hath done the repentaunce of god
is to chaunge any thynge that he
hadde done before as to chaunge
that whyche was begonne thys
waye after an other ſorte eyther
from good to euell as of Saule
whom the lord repented him that
he made hym Kynge eyther from
euell to good thys chaunge from
good to euell from euell to good
as ofte as it chaunceth eyther by
the ſecret and iuſt iudgemente of
GOD eyther by the extreamytie
of his iuſtice or by his mercye we
ſaye that god doth repent.
            When the ſcripture ſaith that
God dothe not repente therby is
meante that in no caſe he chaungeth
ſuche thynges as he had appointed
pſal. Cix. The lorde hath

ſworne and he will not repent .i.
The father to the ſonne thou art
an euerlaſtinge preiſte of the order
of Melchiſedech The ſon of
God is called the preiſt of the father
not in that he is god but mē
in whiche parte .i. manhed he offred
vppe hym ſelfe by hys paſſion
and deathe an acceptable Sacrifice
to God the father for that
he ſhoulde be the prieſt alſo whiche
is the ſacrifice.
            God is ſaied to forget when he
doth not take mercye vppon certein
ſynners and vngodlye perſons
not by cruelty whyche can
not be in hym but throughe his
ſecrete and iuſt iudgement.
            God is ſaied to hardē the hartes
of certen mēas it is writē of Pharao
not becaue almightye God
doth hardē ther hartes through
his almightineſſe for to beleue is
wicked but whē ther oun naughtineſſe

aſkīg vēgeāce he taketh not

thei them ſelfes do noriſhe by euil
doyeng as though he doth harden
them hym ſelfe where as he dothe
permitte thē to be hardened by the
iuſte iudgemente of god.
            God is ſayed to ſlepe when ye only
begotten ſonne of the father dyd
vouchſafe dye for vs in manhead
which he had taken vpō hym whoſe
deathe was well called a ſwete
ſlepe otherwyſe God is ſayed toſlepe
when hys father dothe not watche
but ſlepe ī the hartes of certen
faithfull beynge in proſperite this
ſlepe dyd oure Sauioure figure
in hym ſelfe Mathewe .viii. when
he ſlepte in the ſhyppe in the mydde
waues thyrdelye when GOD
dothe ſuccoure and ayde hys choſen
wythe the ſloweſte beynge in
greate Daunger in the worlde

he is ſaid to ſlepe. Pſa .xliii A riſe
lorde why doſt thou ſlepe
            God dothe watche when he ſheweth
hym ſelfe ready to defend his
choſen and auenge hys aduerſarye.
            Theſe and ſuche other which at
attributed to God by the text of
holye ſcripture are not to be vnderſtande
