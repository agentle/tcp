                  That playne so with pypynge and with rage
                  That were coupled agayne all nature
                  With croked olde that may not longe endure
                  For to perfourme the luste of loues playe
                  For it ne sit not vnto fresshe maye
                  For to be coupled to olde Ianuarye
                  They be so dyuerse that they must varye
                  For olde is grutchynge and malencolyous
                  Alwaye full of Ire and suspeccyous
                  
                     And youth entendeth to Joye and lustynes
                  To myrth and play and to all gladnes
                  Alas that euer it sholde falle
                  Soo swete sugre ycoupled to be galle
                  These yonge folke cryed oft sythe
                  And prayd Uenus her power to kythe
                  Upon this myscheyf and shape remedye
                  And ryght anone I herde other crye
                  With sobbynge teres and pyetous sowne
                  To fore the goddesse by lamentacyon
                  That were constreyned in theyr youth
                  And in chyldhode as is oft a couthe
                  I entred were in to relygyon
                  Or they had yeres of dyscrecyon
                  That all her lyfe can not but complayne
                  In wyde copes perfeccyon or to fayne
                  Full couertly for to couer theyr smerte
                  And shewe the contrary of theyr herte
                  Thus sawe I where many a fayre mayde
                  That on theyr frendes all the wyte they layde
                  And other nexte I sawe there in grete rage
                  That they were maryed in theyr tendre aege
                  Without fredome of fre eleccyon
                  Where loue hath selde domynacyon
                  For loue at large and at lyberte
                  Wolde frely chese and not with suche trete
                  And other sawe I full oft wepe and wrynge
                  That they in men founde suche varyenge
                  To loue a season whyle that beaulte floureth
                  And after by dysdayne soo vngoodly loureth
                  On her yt somtyme he called his lady dere
                  
                     That was to hym so pleasaunt and entyere
                  But lust with fayrnes is so ouer gone
                  That in her herte trouth abydeth none
                  And some also I sawe in teres reyne
                  And pyteously on god and kynde pleyne
                  That euer they wolde on ony creature
                  So moche beaute passynge by mesure
                  Sette on a womnn to gyue occasyon
                  A man to loue to his confusyon
                  And namely there where he shall haue no grace
                  For with a loke forth by as he doth pace
                  Full ofte falleth castynge of an eye
                  A man is wounded that he must nedes deye
                  That neuer perauenture after he shall her se
                  Why wyll god do so grete a cruelte
                  To ony man or to his creature
                  To make hym so moche woo endure
                  For her percas whome he shall in no wyse
                  Reioyse neuer / but so forth in Juyse
                  Lede his lyfe tyll that he be in his graue
                  For he ne durst of her no mercy craue
                  And also perauenture though he durst & wolde.
                  He can not wytte where he her fynde sholde
                  I sawe there also / and therof had I routhe
                  That some were hyndred by couetyse & slouthe
                  And some also for theyr hastynes
                  And other also for theyr rechelesnes
                  But at the last as I walked and behelde
                  Besyde pallas with her crystall shelde
                  Tofore the statute of Uenus sette on heyght
                  There kneled a lady in my syght
                  
                     Tofore the goddesse whiche as the sonn̄e
                  Passeth the sterres and also the storme
                  And Lucyfer to voyde the nyghtes sorowe
                  I clerenes passeth erly the morowe
                  And so as Maye hath the soueraynte
                  Of euery moneth the fayrnes and beaute
                  And as the rose in swetnes and odour
                  Surmounteth floures and bawme of all lycour
                  Hath the pryse and as the rubye bryght
                  Of all stones in beaute and in syght
                  As it is knowe hath the Regalye
                  Ryght so this lady with her goodly eye
                  And with the stremes of her loke so bryght
                  Surmounteth all thrugh beaute in my syght
                  That for to tell her grete semelynes
                  Her womanhede her porte and her fayrnes
                  It was a meruayle how euer that nature
                  Coude in her werkes make a creature
                  So angelyk so goodly one to see
                  So femynyn or passynge of beaute
                  Whose sonnysshe heer bryghter than golde wyre

                  So well ennewed by nature and depaynt
                  As rose and lylyes togyder were meynt
                  So egally by good proporcyon
                  That as me thought by myn inspeccyon
                  I gan meruaylle how god or werke of kynde

                     For in good fayth thrugh her hye presence
                  The temple was enlumyned enuyron
                  And for to speke of her condycyon
                  She was the beste that myght be on lyue
                  For there was none yt with her myght stryue
                  To speke of bounte or of gentylnesse
                  Of womanhede or of lowlynesse
                  Of curtesye or of goodlyhede
                  Of speche of chere or of semelyphede
                  Of porte benygne or of dalyaunce
                  The best taught therto of pleasaunce
                  She was the well also of honeste
                  An exampler and myrrour also was she
                  Of secretnes of trouth of faythfulnes
                  And to all other lady and maystres
                  To shewe vertue who so lyst to lere
                  And so this lady ryght humble of chere
                  Knelynge I sawe clad in grene and whyte
                  Tofore Uenus goddesse of all delyte
                  Enbrowded all with stones and perre
                  So rychely that Joye it was to se
                  With sondry rolles on her garnement
                  For texpowne the trouth of her entent
                  To shewe fully that for her humblesse
                  And for her vertue and her stablenesse
                  That she was rote of all womanly pleasaunce
                  Therfore her worde without varyaunce
                  Enbrowded as men myght see
                  De mieulx en mieulx with stones of perre
                  This is to say that she was so benygne
                  From better to better her herte doth resygne
                  
                     And all her wyll to venus the goddesse
                  Whan that her lyst her harmes to redresse
                  For as me thought som what by her chere
                  For to complayne she had grete desyre
                  For in her hande she helde a lytell bylle
                  For to declare the sōme of all her skylle
                  And to the goddesse her quarell for to shewe
                  Theffecte of whiche was in wordes fewe

                  So that my byll may your grace atteyne
                  Redresse to fynde of that I me complayne
               
               
                  For I am bounde to thynge that I nolde
                  Frely to chese there lacke I lyberte
                  And so I wante of that myn herte wolde
                  The body is knyt / though my thought be free
                  
                     So that I must of necessyte
                  My hertes lyst outwarde contrarye

                  My thought gooth forth my body is behynde
                  For I am here / and yonder my remembraunce.
                  Bytwene two so hange I in balance
               
               
                  Deuoyde of Joye / of woo I haue plente
                  What I desyre that may I not possede
                  For that I nolde is redy ay to me
                  And that I loue / for to sue I drede
                  To my desyre contrary is my mede

                  Within myn herte I may complayne of colde
                  And by excesse though I swelte and swete

                  For he that hath myn herte faythfully
                  And hole my loue in all honeste
                  Without chaunge all be it secretly
                  
                     Unto theffecte and complaynt of my byll
                  Syth lyfe and deth I put all in thy wyll

                  For vnto you I shall his herte so lowe

                     In vertu only his youth to cherysshe

                  Thus euer slepynge dremynge as I laye
                  Within the temple me thought I sawe
                  Grete preces of folke murmure wonderfull
                  To croude and shoue the temple was so full
                  Eueryche full besy in his owne cause
                  That I ne may shortly in a clause
                  Dysceyue all the rytes and the guyse
                  And eke I wante connynge to deuyse
                  How some there were wt blode encence & mylke
                  And some with floures swete and soft as sylke
                  And some with sparowes and doues whyte
                  That for to gan them delyte
                  Unto the goddesse with syghe and prayer
                  Them to relese of that they moost desyre
                  That for the prees shortly to conclude
                  I went my waye for the multytude
                  Me for to refresshe out of prees alone
                  And by myselfe me thought as I gan gone
                  With in the estres and gan a whyle tarye
                  I sawe a man that walked all solytary
                  That as me semed for heuynes and dole
                  Hym to complayne that he walked so sole
                  Without espyenge of ony other wyght
                  And yf I shall dyscryue hym a ryght
                  Yf that he had not be in heuynes
                  Me thought he was / to speke of semelynes
                  Of shap of fourme / and also of stature
                  The moost passynge / that euer yet nature
                  
                     Made in her werkes / and lyke to be a man
                  And therwith all as I reherce can
                  Of face and chere the moost gracyous
                  To be byloued happy and ewrous
                  But as it semed out ward by his chere
                  That he complayned for lacke of his desyre
                  For by hymselfe as he walked vp and down
                  I herde hym make a lamentacyon
                  And sayd alas / what thyng may this be
                  That now am bounde that whilom was fre
                  And went at large at myn eleccyon
                  Now am I caught vnder subieccyon
                  For to become a very homagere
                  To god of loue / where or I cam here
                  Felte in myn herte / nought of loues payne
                  But now of new / within her fyry chayne
                  I am enbrased soo that I may not stryue
                  To serue and loue while I am on lyue
                  The goodly fresshe in the temple yonder
                  I sawe right now / that I had wonder
                  However god / for to reke all
                  Myght make a thynge soo celestyall
                  Soo angelyke on erthe to appere
                  For within the stremes of her eyen clere
                  I am wounded euen to the hert
                  That fro the deth I may not astert
                  And moost I meruayle that soo sodeynly
                  I was soo yelde to be at her mercy
                  Whether that she lyst me to lyue or deye
                  Withoute more / I must her lust obeye
                  And take mekely my sodeyn auenture
                  
                     For syth my lyf my deth / and eke my cure
                  Is in her hand it wyll not auaylle
                  To grutche agayn / for of this bataylle
                  The palme is hers / and playnly the vyctorye
                  If I rebelled honour none ne glorye
                  I myght not in ony wyle acheue
                  Syth I am yelden / how shold I thenne preue
                  To reaue away / I wote hit wyll not be
                  Though I be loos / at large I may not flee
                  O god of loue how sharp is now thyn arowe
                  Now mayst thou now soo cruelly & soo narowe
                  Withoute cause hurte me and wounde
                  And takest none hede my sorowes to founde
                  But lyke a byrde that fleeth at her desyre
                  Tyll sodeynly within the pantyre
                  She is caught though late she was at large
                  A new tempest forcasteth now my barge
                  Now vp now doun / with wynde it is so blowe
                  Soo am I tossed and almost ouerthrowe
                  Ferdryue in derkenes of many sondry wawe
                  Alas whan shall this tempest ouerdrawe
                  To clere the skyes of myn aduersyte
                  The lode sterre what that I ne may see
                  It is soo hyd with clowdes that be blacke
                  Alas whan wyll this torment ouerslacke
                  I can not wyte / for who is hurt of newe
                  And bledeth in ward tyll he were pale of hewe
                  And hath his wound inwardly fresshe & grene
                  And it is not knowen vnto the harmes kene
                  Of myghty cupyde that can soo hertes daunte
                  That no man in his warre dare hym vaunte
                  
                     To gete a pryce but oonly by mekenes
                  For there ne vayleth stryue ne sturdynes
                  Soo maye I saye that with a loke am yolde
                  And have no power to stryue though I wolde
                  Thus stonde I euer betwix lyf and deth
                  To loue and serue whyle I have breth
                  In suche a place where I dare not playne
                  Lyke hym that is in torment and in payne
                  And knoweth not to whom to discure
                  For there that I haue holy set my cure
                  I dare not well for drede ne for daunger
                  And for vnknowen tellen how the fyre
                  Of loues bronde is kyndled in my breste
                  Thus am I murdred and slayn atte leste
                  Soo pryuely within my thought
                  O lady venus whom I haue sought
                  Soo wysshe me now what me is best to doo
                  That am distraught with my selfe soo
                  That I ne wote what waye for to torne
                  Sauf by my selfe soleyn for to morne
                  Hangyng in balance betwixe hope and drede
                  Without comforte remedye or rede
                  For hope biddeth pursue and assaye
                  And agayn ward drede answerth naye
                  And now with hope I am set a lofte
                  But drede and daunger hard & nothyng softe
                  Hath ouerthrowe my trust and put a doun
                  Now at my large / now fetred in prysoun
                  Now in torment / now in souerayn glorye
                  Now in paradyse and now in purgatorye
                  As man dispayred in a double werre
                  Borne up with hope / & thenne anone daunger
                  
                     Me draweth a backe / and sayth it shall not be
                  For where as I of myne aduersyte
                  Am bolde som whyle mercy to requyre
                  Thenne cometh dispair & begynneth me to lere
                  A newe lesson to hope full the contrarye
                  They ben soo dyuerse they wyll do me varye
                  And thus I stande dismayed in a traunce
                  For whan hope were lykly me tauaunce
                  For drede I tremble & dare one word not speke
                  And yf hit soo be / that I not outbreke
                  To tell the harmes that greuen me soo sore
                  But in myselfe lencrece them more and more
                  And to be slayn fully me delyte
                  When of my deth she is noo thynge to wyte
                  For but yf she the contreynt playnly knowe
                  How shold she euer / on my paynes rue
                  Thus oft tyme with hope I am meuyd
                  To tell her all / how I am greuyd
                  And to be hardy on me for to take
                  To axe mercy / but drede doth me then̄e a wake
                  And thenne wanhope answeryth me agayn
                  That better were that she haue disdayne
                  To deye attones unknowen of ony wyght
                  And therwith all biddeth hope anone ryght
                  Me to be bolde and praye her of grace
                  And syth all vertues be portreyd in her face
                  Hit were not syttyng / that pyte were behynde
                  And right anone within my selfe I fynde
                  A newe plee brought on me with drede
                  That me soo maseth that I see noo spede
                  By cause he sayd that stonyeth all my blood
                  
                     I am soo symple and she is soo good
                  Thus hope and drede in me wyll not seace
                  To plete and stryue my harmes to encreace
                  But at hardest yet or I be dede
                  Of my distresse syth I can noo rede
                  But stande doun styll as ony stone
                  To fore the goddesse I wyll me haste anone
                  And complayne withoute more sermon
                  Though deth be fyn and full conclusyon
                  Of my request / yet I wyll assaye
                  And right anone me thought I saye
                  This wofull man as I have me morye
                  Full lowly entre in to an oratorye
                  And kneled adoun in full humble wyse
                  To fore the goddesse and gan anone deuyse

                  Tofore thy lady and lowly knele a downe
