               In greateſt daunger you thinke to be.
            
            
               A Clyent, betweene two Lawyers. A Maide, betweene two Friers.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           〈…〉
                         the 
                           •
                        equell doe nor doubt.
                     Betweene 
                           〈…〉
                         both, with loſſſe I muſt wrinng out.
                     But it's I muſt bring thy matter well about.
                     I am 
                           〈…〉
                         elder, and can beſt counſaile giue.
                     I ſtill ſhall doubt, when
two ſuch doe meſhrieue.
                     I am the younger, doe him beeleeve.
                  
               
               
                  Clyent.
                  Good Sir what thinke you of my caſe?
               
               
                  Lawyer.
                  Tis cleere, & good, & iuſt.
               
               
                  Clyent.
                  But what ſay you Sir?
               
               
                  Lawyer.
                  This I ſay, take heede to whom you truſt.
               
               
                  Clyent.
                  Why Sir? thinke you he is not learn'd?
               
               
                  Lawyer.
                  Yes, but his power is ſmall,
                  Giue me my fee, it is in me to make an end of all.
               
               
                  Clyent.
                  Now in what daung
                        •
                     r ſtandes my caſe, in theſe two Lawyers handes?
                  That while I creepe to them for wordes, they creepe into my Landes.
               
               
                  Maide.
                  What ſay you holy man to me?
               
               
                  Frier.
                  I ſay, faire holy maide,
                  Leane thou to me, and on my loue, let all thy ſinnes be laide:
               
               
                  Maide.
                  And what ſay you good man?
               
               
                  Frier.
                  I ſay ſhew all to me;
                  That better then that aged man, can helpe and comfort thee.
               
               
                  Maide.
                  Now in what perill ſtandes a Maide, in ſhrieft betweene two Friers?
                  That only make the Church a Cloake, to couer foule deſires.
               
            
            
               A Gooſe, betweene two Foxes. A Rat, betweene two Cats. 
               
                  
                     Goſſip be ſilent, and doe leaue your prate.
                     Then what meanes Raynards walke abroad ſo late.
                     Neighbours you knowe, falſe dealing I doe hate.
                     Tis pittie that this ſpoyling beaſt doth liue.
                     My ſmalleſt faults muſt puniſht be,
                     When greater theeues are let goe free.
                     Then Siſter Puſſe, doe you the onſet giue.
                  
               
               
                  Gooſe.
                  Sir Raynard, what ſay you to me?
               
               
                  Raynard
                  I ſay you ſlaine the graſſe:
                  And you are like to anſwer for, the treſpaſſe ere you paſſe.
               
               
                  Gooſe.
                  And what ſay you good Sir?
               
               
                  Raynard.
                  Your keakeing wak'd my Dame,
                  And you ſhall knowe, what tis to bring the houſe ſo out of frame.
               
               
                  Gooſe.
                  Alas hard hap, one ſimple Gooſe, to be two Foxes prey,
                  When from one Fox, a flocke of Geeſe can hardly ſcape away.
               
               
                  Rat.
                  Good Miſtris Puſſe, tell me wherefore you aime thus at my head?
               
               
                  Cat.
                  Becauſe you ſtole my Miſtris Cheeſe, her Candles, and her Bread.
               
               
                  Rat.
                  And what ſay you good Puſſe?
                  
               
               
                  Cat.
                  You gnaw'd my Miſtris Ruffes,
Her Aprons, Towells, Handkerchiefes, her Falling Bands, and Cuffes.
               
               
                  Rat.
                  Alas, that one poore Rat, ſhould come, to die betweene two Cats,
When one good Cat, will ſerue the turne, to kill a world of Rats.
