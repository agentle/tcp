            A DISCOVRSE OF Trade from England vnto the Eaſt Indies: Anſwering to diuerſe Obiections which are vſually made againſt the ſame.
            
               THe trade of Merchandize, is not onely that laudable practize wherby the entercourſe of Nations is ſo worthily performed, but alſo (as I may terme it) the verie Touchſtone of a kingdomes proſperitie, when therein ſome certen rules ſhall be diligently obſerued. For, as in the eſtates of priuate perſons, wee may

accompt that man to proſper and growe rich, who being poſſeſſed of reuenues more or leſſe, doth accordingly proportion his expences; whereby he may yearelie aduance ſome maintenance for his poſteritie. So doth it come to paſſe in thoſe Kingdomes, which with great care and warineſſe doe euer vent out more of their home commodities, then they import and vſe of forren wares; for ſo vndoubtedly the remainder muſt returne to them in treaſure. But where a contrarie courſe is taken, through wantonneſſe and riot; to ouer waſte both forren and domeſtike wares; there muſt the money of neceſſitie be exported, as the meanes to helpe to furniſh ſuch exceſſe, and ſo by the corruption of mens conditions and manners, manie rich countries are made exceeding poore, whileſt the people thereof, too much affecting their owne enormities, doe lay the fault in ſomething elſe.
            Wherefore, induſtry to increaſe, and frugalitie to maintaine, are the true watchmen of a kingdomes treaſury; euen when, the force and feare of Princes prohibitions cannot poſſibly retaine the ſame.
            And therefore, as it is moſt plaine, that proportion or quantitie, muſt euer be regarded in the importing of forren wares; ſo muſt there alſo be a great reſpect of qualitie and vſe; that ſo, the things moſt neceſſarie

be firſt preferred; ſuch as are foode, rayment, and munition for warre and trade; which great bleſſinges, when any countrie doth ſufficiently enioy; the next to be procured are wares, fitting for health, and arts; the laſt, are thoſe, which ſerue for our pleaſures, and ornament.
            Now, foraſmuch, as by the prouidence of almightie God, the kingdome of England, is indowed with ſuch aboundance of rich commodities, that it hath long enioyed, not onely great plentie of the things before named, but alſo, through a ſuperfluitie, hath beene much inriched with treaſure brought in from forren parts; which hath giuen life vnto ſo many worthy trades, amongſt which that vnto the Eaſt India by name; the report whereof, although it is already ſpread ſo famous through the world; yet notwithſtanding, heere at home, the clamorous complaints againſt the ſame, are growne ſo loude and generall; that (my ſelfe being one of the Society it hath much troubled my priuate meditations, to conceaue the means or true groundes of this confuſion. But at the laſt I reſolued my ſelfe, that the greateſt number of theſe exclaimers, are led away in ignorance; not hauing as yet, diſcerned the myſteries of ſuch waightie affaires; Some haue beene tranſported with enuie, as not participating in the ſaid Societie, or beeing

thereby hindred (as they conceiue) in ſome other trade; and others, wholy corrupted in their affections; who whileſt they willingly runne into theſe errors, doe alſo labour diligently to ſeduce others; that ſo, this good and glorie of the kingdome, might be ſubuerted by our ſelues, which by the pollicie and ſtrength of Strangers, cannot ſo eaſilie be abated; wherefore, it is now a fit time to meete with ſuch iniurious courſes, by a true Narration of the paſſages in the ſaid Eaſt-India Trade; anſwering to thoſe ſeuerall obiections, which are ſo commonlie made againſt the ſame; That ſo theſe miſunderſtandings and errours may be made knowne vnto the whole body of this Kingdome, which at this preſent time is moſt worthily repreſented in thoſe noble aſſemblies of the high Courts of Parliament; where I hope the worth of this rich Trade, ſhall be effectually inquired, and ſo in the end obtaine the credit of an honorable approbation.
            
               The firſt Obiection.
               It were a happie thing for Chriſtendome (ſay many men) that the Nauigation to the Eaſt-Indies, by way of the Cape of Good hope, had neuer bene found

out; For in the fleetes of ſhippes, which are ſent thither yearely out of England, Portingall, and the Low countries; The gold, ſiluer, and Coyne of Chriſtendome, and particularly of this Kingdome, is exhauſted, to buy vnneceſſarie wares.
               
                  The Anſwere.
                  
                     THe matter of this Obiection is very waighty; and therefore, it ought to be anſwered fully; the which that I may the better performe, I will diuide the fame into three parts.
                  1 In the firſt, I will conſider, the neceſſarie vſe of the wares, which are vſually brought out of Eaſt-India into Europe; namely, Druggs, Spices, Rawſilke, Indicoe, and Callicoes.
                  2 In the Second; I will intimate the manner and meanes, by which the ſaid wares haue beene heretofore, and now are brought into Europe.
                  
                  3 In the Third and laſt; I will proue, that the Treaſure of England, is not conſumed, but rather greatly to be increaſed by the performance of the ſaid Trade.
                  Touching the Firſt; Who is ſo ignorant,

in any famous common wealth,
                        The Firſt part concerneth the vſe of Indian wares. which will not conſent to the moderate vſe of wholeſome Druggs and comfortable Spices? Which, haue beene ſo much deſired in all times, and by ſo many Nations; not thereby to ſurfeit, or to pleaſe a lickoriſh taſt (as it often happeneth, with many other fruites and wines) but rather as things moſt neceſſarie to preſerue their health, and to cure their diſeaſes; euen as it is moſt notably ſet forth,
                        Sir. Thomas Elyot his Caſtle of health. Rembert Dodoneus his hiſtory of Plants.
                        
                        The French Academy ſecond part, and others.
                      by ſome learned men, who haue vndertaken, to write vpon this ſubiect; and therefore; it ſhall be altogether needleſſe heere to diſcourſe vpon their ſeuerall operations and vertues, ſeeing that, he that liſteth, may be well inſtructed therein, if hee will peruſe the volumes, which are penned by the learned, for the benefit of all thoſe, who ſhall make vſe thereof.
                  But if peraduenture, it be yet further vrged; that diuers Nations, liue without the vſe of Druggs and Spices: the anſwer is, That either ſuch people know not their vertue; and therefore, ſuffer much by the want of wares ſo healthfull; or elſe, they are moſt miſerable; being without meanes to obtaine the thinges, which they ſo much want; but ſithence I intend to be breife, I will inſiſt no further vpon this point; For the Obiecters might aſwell deny vs the vſe of Sugars, Wynes, Oyles, Rayſons, Figgs, Prunes, and

Currandes; and with farre more reaſon exclaime againſt Tobacco, Cloth of gold and Siluer, Lawnes, Cambricks, Gold and Siluer lace, Veluets, Sattens, Taffaeties and diuers others manifactures, yearely brought into this Realme, for an infinite value; all which as it is moſt true, that whileſt we conſume them, they likewiſe deuoure our wealth; yet neuertheleſſe, the moderate vſe of all theſe wares hath euer ſuted well with the riches and Maieſtie of this Kingdome.
                  But I will come to the Raw-ſilkes and Indico; this being ſo excellent for the dying of our woollen-cloathes, thereby ſo much eſteemed in ſo many places of the world; that ornament, together with the great reliefe and maintenance of ſo many hundreds of poore people; who are continuallie imployed, in the winding, twiſting, and weauing of the ſame; Inſomuch, that by the cheriſhing of this buſines (as his Maieſtie, for his parte is graciouſlie pleaſed to performe, in remitting the impoſt of Silke) it may well be hoped, that in ſhort time,
                        France and the Low Countries of late yeares do make great quantities of wrought ſilke, of which wares they were heretofore ſerued from Italy.
                      induſtrie will make the arte to flouriſh, with no leſſe happineſſe to this Kingdome, then it hath done (through many ages) to diuerſe ſtates in Italy, and latelie alſo to the Kingdome of France, and to the vnited Prouinces of the Low countries.
                  Now as touching the Trade of Callicoes,
                     
of many ſortes, into which the Engliſh lately made an entrance; although it cannot be truely ſayd, that this commoditie is ptoffitable, for the ſtate of Chriſtendome in generall (in reſpect they are the manifacture of Infidells, and in great part the weare of Chriſtans) yet neuertheleſſe,France, Italy, South Barbary, and other Countries.
                      this commoditie, likewiſe is of ſinguler vſe, for this common wealth in particuler; not onelie therewith to increaſe the Trade into forren parts; but alſo thereby, greatly to abate the exceſſiue prices of Cambricks, Holland, and other ſorts of Linnen-cloath; which daily are brought into this Kingdom for a verie great ſumme of mony. And this ſhall ſuffice concerning the neceſſarie vſe of the Indian wares;
                        The Second part Sheweth the manner & the meanes by which Indian wares haue beene and now are brought into Europe.
                      In the next place, I will ſet forth the manner and meanes of their importing into Europe.
                  
                  It is an errour in thoſe men; who thinke that the Trade of the Eaſt-Indies into Europe had firſt entrance, by the diſcouerie of the Nauigation by the Cape of Good-hope. For many yeares before that time, the traffique of thoſe parts, had his ordinary courſe by ſhipping from diuerſe places in the Indies; yearely reſorting with their wares to Mocha in the Red-Sea, and Balſera in the Perſian-Gulfe: From both which places, the Merchandize (with great charges) were after tranſported ouerland by the Turkes
                     
vpon Cammells, 50. dayes iourney, vnto Aleppo in Soria, and to Alexandria in Egypt, (which are the Mart Townes, from whence diuerſe Nations, as well Turkes, as Chriſtians, doe continually diſperſe the ſayd wares by Sea into the partes of Europe:) by which courſe, the common enemie of Chriſtendome (the Turke) was Maiſter of the Trade; which did greatly imploy,Rates vpon all ſorts of Spices. 22. per cent. Rawe-Silkes eſteemed about 2. per cent. Indico about 8. per cent. and inrich his Subiects, and alſo fill the Coffers of his owne cuſtomes, which he exacted at very high rates; But by the prouidence of almightie God, the diſcouerie of that Nauigation, to the Eaſt-Indies by the Cape of Goodhope (now ſomuch frequented by the Engliſh, Portingalls, and Dutche; and alſo attempted, by other Chriſtian Kingdomes) hath not onely much decayed the great commerce, betweene the Indians and the Turkes in the Red Sea; and in the Perſian Gulfe (to their infinite hurt, and to the great increaſe of Chriſtian trade,) but it hath alſo brought a further happineſſe vnto Chriſtendome in generall, and to the Realme of England in particular, for the venting of more Engliſh commodities; and for exporting of a leſſe quantitie of ſiluer out of Europe, vnto the Infidells, by many thouſand poundes yearely, then hath beene accuſtomed in former times; as I ſhall proue moſt plainlie by that which followeth.
                  
                     And Firſt, it will be neceſſarie to ſet downe the quantitie of Spices, Indico, and Perſian Raw-ſilke (which is yearely conſumed in Europe) and in them all to conſider the coſt with the charges to lade the ſame commodities cleare aboard the Shippes from Aleppo; and the like of all the ſelfe ſame wares, as they haue beene vſually diſpatched from the Portes of the Eaſt-Indies; wherein, will appeare that happineſſe, which many doe ſo much oppoſe; eſpecially our owne Countrie-men, vnder the gilded tearmes of the Common-wealth; whileſt beeing indeed either ignorant,Such people as affect not the good of this Kingdome or ill affected, they doe not onelie groſly erre themſelues, but alſo cauſe others to hinder as much as in them lieth, the glorie and well-fare of this Kingdome; but leauing them, I will ſet downe the ſaid wares, in their quantitie and prizes as followeth; and firſt,

                     So that by the ſubſtance, and ſummes of theſe accompts, it doth plainely appeare, that the buying of the ſaid quantitie of Raw-ſilkes, Indico, and Spices, may be performed in the Indies, for neare one third part of the ready moneyes, which were accuſtomed to be ſent into Turkey to prouide the ſame;The exportation of the value of 953543. l. ſtarling out of Chriſtendome into Turkey yeerely ſaued. So that there will bee ſaued euerie yeere the value of 953543.l. 4 s. 4. d. ſtarling of readie moneyes, that heretofore hath beene exported out of Chriſtendome into Turkey
                     ▪ which is a matter of ſuch note and conſequence, that it may ſeeme incredible, before the circumſtance be dulie conſidered; and therefore leaſt I ſhould leaue the matter in doubt, it is requiſite; that I doe make an explanation of ſome particulars.
                  And principallie, it muſt not bee conceiued, that this great aduantage, which hath beene ſpoken of▪ is onely the Merchants gaine; for the Common-wealth of Chriſtendoe, hath a very great part thereof in the cheapnes of the wares, as ſhall be (God willing) proued hereafter in his due place.
                  Secondly, the time of the Merchants forbearance, and intereſt, is verie long: his aduenture and aſſurance much dearer; his charges of ſhipping, victuals, Marriners, and factors their wages, far greater, then by the voyage into Turkey for the ſame

wares; ſo that the former great difference muſt be vnderſtood in theſe particulers; whereby we may perceiue to our comfort, that the Materialls of the kingdome, and the imployments of the ſubiects (in liew of readie moneies) becomes a verie great part of the price which is paid for the ſaid Indian wares;Inſtance only, that ten ſhillings imployed in Pepper in the Eaſt-Indies, will require thirty and fiue ſhillings for all charges whatſoeuer to deliuer it in London.
                      which cannot hurt the State (as ſome erroniouſly ſuppoſe) but greatly helpe it, as I ſhal better proue in that which followeth.
                  Firſt therefore, I ſhew for an vndoubted truth, That the Perſians, Moores and Indians, who trade with the Turkes, at Aleppo, Mocha, and Alexandria, for Raw-ſilkes, Drugs, Spices, Indico and Callicoes; haue alwaies made, and ſtill doe make, their returnes in readie monie: for other wares, there are but few which they deſire from forren partes; ſome Chamblets, Corrall, wrought ſilke, woollen-cloth, with ſome trifles, they doe yearely vent in all, not for aboue 40. or 50. thouſand pounds ſtarling;The great Summes of money which the Perſians and the Indians carrie yeerely out of Turkey.
                      which is no valuable ſumm in reſpect of that wealth which is carried from Aleppo and Conſtantinople into Perſia for Raw-ſilkes, when leaſt, 500000. poundes ſtarling Per annum: and from Mocha about 600000. pounds ſtarling (likewiſe yearely into India) for returne of Callicoes, Drugs, Sugar, Rice, Tobacco, and diuerſe other things. So here is ſtill a very great Commerce maintained betweene

thoſe Infidels; not onely for the Callicoes of many ſortes, and other wares (which concerne their owne vſe) but alſo for the Raw-ſilkes of Perſia, which are altogether tranſported into Chriſtendome.
                  
                  How worthy an enterpriſe is it therefore in the Engliſh Eaſt-India Companie? by whoſe endeauours, there is now good hope to turne a great part of this wealthy Trade into England, by ſhipping directlie from the Perſian-Gulfe, whereby the imployments,The Eaſt-India Companie doe endeauor to bring the Raw-Silkes from Perſia directly by Sea. traffique, and Cuſtomes of the Turkes, may be ſtill more and more impaired; & the generall Treaſure of Chriſtendome? much leſſe conſumed; as is alreadie performed for the buſineſſe of Spices and Indico.
                  And who ſhall then doubt our want of Siluer to mainetaine the Trade? if by this way wee doe obtaine the Silke, which with more aduantage and conueniencie, wil draw the money to this Mart, then it hath beene heeretofore conueyed vnto thoſe remote dominions of the Turke.
                  
                  And leaſt peraduenture it ſhould be thought, that the traffique in thoſe parts by the Chriſtians for the Perſian Silke, is performed by change for other wares, or by the money which proceedeth of the ſales of many rich commodities, which yeerely they ſell at Aleppo, Alaxandria, Conſtantinople, and theſe parts.
                  
                     The anſwere is, that neither the Venetians; French, nor Dutche, doe vent ſo much of their owne Country commodities in thoſe partes, as doe prouide their neceſſarie wants of the proper wares of Turkes
                     ▪ ſuch, as are the fine Raw-ſilke, made in Soria, Chamblets, Grogerans, Cotten-woolles,
                        Marcellis ſendeth yeerely to Aleppo & Alexandria at leaſt 500000. l. ſterling, and little or no wares. Venice ſendes about the value of 100000. l. and a great value in wares.
                        The Lowcountries ſends about the value of 50000. l. ſterling monies, and litle wares. Meſſina 25000. l. in ready money.
                      Cotten-yarne, Gaules, Flax, Hempe, Fleece-woolls, Rice, Hides, Waxe, & diuerſe other things; ſo that ſtill the raw-ſilkes of Perſia, muſt be bought with ready mony. Only the Engliſh haue more aduantage then any other Nation in this kinde, for they vent ſo great a quantitie of broade-cloathes, tinne, and other Engliſh commodities, that the proceede thereof, doth not only prouide a ſufficient quantitie of part of the ſayd Turkiſh wares (which fit their vſe,) but alſo a proportion of about 300. great balles of Perſia Raw-ſilke yearely.
                  And if in any yeare, they chance to buy a greater quantitie of ſilke, then muſt and do they furniſh the ſame in ready monies from the Portes of Marcellis, Genouay, Ligorne, Venice, or the Netherlandes. Neither are theſe the onely meanes, whereby the Empire of the Turke is ſo abundantly ſtored with God and Siluer, to the performance of the Indian-trade. For, many are the Chriſtian ſhippes, which yearely lade with corne for ready monies in the Archipelago; Great is

the commerce from Poland, Hungarie, and Germany,
                     
                        Abiſſians a people in Ethiopia whoſe influence hath made them dull, lazy and without artes; enioying diuers Mines of Gold and one of Siluer, which doe procure their wants of forren wares. with Gold and Dollers, for Chamblets, Grogerans, and other things: But that which is very remarkable, is the great quantitie of gold & ſome ſiluer coyned in Grand-Cairo, which by two ſeuerall Carrauans (in bullion) is yearely brought thither from the Abiſſians countrie in Ethiopia, for returne of many rich commodities, as Veluets, Sattens, Cloth of Gold, Taffaties, Woollencloath: poliſhed Corrall, and other things.
                  Thus by the coherence of the Turkiſh-Trade with the Chriſtians, Perſians and Indians, I haue ſhewed both the manner and the meanes, whereby the Eaſt-Indians wares haue beene heretofore, and yet are, in part, procured into Chriſtendome. But leaſt it ſhould ſeeme incredible, that the Turke would let ſo great a Maſſe of Treaſure yeerly to paſſe his Dominions, to the Indians and to the Perſians his profeſſed enemies: I will make the matter yet more plaine.
                  And Firſt, concerning the Raw-ſilkes, it is alreadie ſhewed, that hee hath the money from the Chriſtians, beſides the benefit he reapeth in their cuſtomes, with great imployments alſo for his Subiects. And for the Callicoes (his whole Empire hauing litle or no other meanes for Linnen) he cannot poſſibly be without them,
                        Turkey hath litle meanes for Linnen but onely from India.
                      although it hath, & doth greatly exhauſt his treaſure,

neither doth hee gaine any manufacture by the ſame, as the Chriſtians haue alwayes done by the Raw-ſilke, to the great reliefe of innumerable poore people, ſo much prouided for, by the pollicie of all well gouerned and flouriſhing common-wealths; As by this occaſion,The proceedings of ſome States in Italy for the maintenance of Artes. and in a buſineſſe of the like kind, I may inſtance the States of Genouay, Florence, and Luca; who for the maintenance of Artes and Trade, doe prouide Raw-ſilkes out of Sicilia for the value of 500000. poundes ſtarling at leaſt yearelie; and for the payment thereof they doe vent at Naples, Palermo, Meſſina, and thoſe parts, a certaine quantitie of Florence
                     ▪ Raſhes and ſome other wares, for about 150000. pounds ſtarling per annum; So the reſt,The ready moneys which are yearly carried from ſome States of Italy into Sicilia.
                      being 350000. l. ſterling, is ſupplyed all in readie moneies; which treaſure they doe willingly forſake, to procure their Trade; for experience hath taught them that Trade is their imployment, and doth returne them treaſure; for by thoſe ſilkes (being wrought, tranſported and ſould at Franckforde and other Marts) they haue the better meanes, to furniſh their contracts with the King of Spaine in Flanders; and ſo from Spaine the Siluer muſt returne againe to Italy. But if I ſhould runne out in this and other particulars (fiting our purpoſe) it would make me too tedious, and ſo carrie me

beyond my ayme, which is to be briefe.
                  Wherefore, I will proceede to cleare ſome doubts, in thoſe men, who perhaps not hauing the knowledge of occurrents in forren partes, might thinke, that neither Venice, nor Marcellis haue the meanes or yet the mindes, to exporte ſuch great Sommes of readie monyes, yearely out of thoſe Dominions; eſpecially Marcellis being a part of France, where neighborhoode doth daily tell vs, that gold and Siluer, may not be conueied out of that Kingdome, for any valuable Somme, more then is permitted for the neceſſarie vſe of Trauellers; Yet neuertheleſſe experience hath likewiſe taught vs, that for the effecting of thoſe Trades (whereof wee now ſpeake, and which they eſteeme ſo much) there is a free extraction out of the ſayd places, of moneyes both gold and ſiluer; whereof with them there is no want; for, the ſayd wares doe procure it abundantly.
                  
                     How Marcellis and Venice are furniſhed with ready moneys.Firſt, to Marcellis, it commeth not onely from Genouay, Ligorne, Cartagenia, Malliga, and many other Porte townes of Spaine and Itally, but alſo from Parris, Roane, Sainct Malloes, Tolouſe, Rochell, Deepe, and other Cities of France; who want not meanes to haue great ſtore of Rialls, and Dallers from Spaine & Germany.
                  
                  
                     And in like manner, the Venetians diſtributing the ſayd Raw-ſilkes, and other wares into the ſeuerall States of Itally, Germany, and Hungaria, (who haue but few commodities fitting their barter or exchange: but onely monyes) are therewith aboundantly ſerued; For the mynes of Hungarie and Germany affoord good quantitie of Gold and Siluer; And likewiſe the States of Itally, eſpeciallie Genouay, Florence, and Millane, haue euer ſtore of Rialls out of Spaine in ſatisfaction of many great diſburſments, which thoſe Merchantes make for that King in his occaſions of Itally and Flanders;The Italyan Merchants doe furniſh the king of Spaine with money in Italy and Flanders.
                      of all which, I might make a large diſcourſe, but I conceaue I haue ſayd ſufficient, to ſhew how the trade of the Eaſt Indies hath beene, and now is brought into Chriſtendome generally: what money is yearely ſent out; by whom; and the poſſibilitie, or meanes which they haue to performe it. I will therefore in the next place, ſatiſfie the Obiections; that it is not the Eaſt-India Trade, which waſteth the Gold, and Siluer, Coyne, or other treaſure of this kingdome in particular.
                  For firſt, who knoweth not,
                        The third part doth ſhew how the Eaſt-India, Trade doth enrich this Kingdome. that gold in the Eaſt-Indies hath no ratable price with Siluer? Neither hath the Siluer coyne of England any equall value with

the Spaniſh Rialls according to their ſeuerall prizes here, Beſides that, his Maieſtie hath not authorized the Eaſt-India Companie, to ſend away any part of this kingdomes Coyne either Gold, or Siluer, but onely a certaine limited ſumme of forren Siluer yearlie; which as they dare not exceede, ſo neuer haue they as yet accompliſhed the ſame.
                  For it doth plainely appeare in their bookes; that from the originall and firſt foundation of the Trade,How much money and wares the Eaſt-India Company haue ſent forth euer ſithence the beginning of this Trade. in Anno 1601. vntill the moneth of Iuly, Anno 1620. they haue ſhipped away onely 548090. l. ſterling in Spaniſh Rialls, and ſome Dollers; whereas, by licence, they might haue exported in that time 720000. l. ſterling.
                  Alſo they haue laden away in the ſame tearme of xix yeares, out of this Kindgome 292286. l. ſterling in Broad-clothes, Kerſies, Lead, Tinne, with ſome other Engliſh and forren commodities; which is a good Addition; and vent of our wares, into ſuch remote places; where heretofore they haue had no vtterance at all.
                  
                     The vent of Engliſh wares increaſed in the Indies
                     And note, I pray you, how time and induſtrie, hath bettered this Trade, when in the laſt three yeares, there hath beene ſent more wares to the Indies, then in the xvi. yeares before; and yet our expectation

is not at the higheſt, for thoſe new borne Trades within the Red Sea, and in the Perſian Gulfe, doe bid vs hope for better things, as lately by letters from Spahan, we vnderſtand of great quantity of Raw ſilke prepared by the Engliſh factors, which (by Gods aſſiſtance) wee may expect here about the Moneth of Auguſt next, with encouragement alſo, to vent our Engliſh cloth, and Kerſies in good quantities; the like of Iron, Tinne, and other things; whereof experience (of thoſe alreadie ſould) hath giuen vs ſufficient approbation of their valliditie.
                  And now (omitting much matter which might be written touching the diſcoueries of other Trades from one Kingdome or port to another, in the Indies:Our ſtock may be much increaſed by Trade from Port to Porte in the Indies.
                      with the commodities thereof, whereby the imployment of our ſhippes, together with the ſtocke of money and goodes which is ſent out of England in them, may be much increaſed) I will draw to a concluſion of the point in hand; and ſhewe,The moneys ſent to the Indies is all forren Coyne- that whatſoeuer Summes of forren readie monyes are yearely ſent from hence into the Eaſt-Indies, His Maieſtie in the letters Pattents graunted to that Company, hath notwithſtanding with ſingular Care prouided,The Eaſt-India Companie are obliged. that the brethren of the Company, ſhall yearely bring in as much ſiluer, as they ſend

forth;to bring in as much money as they carry out of the Realme. which hath beene alwayes truly performed, with an ouerplus, to the increaſe of this Kingdomes treaſure: Neither is it likelie, that the money which is thus contracted for, by the Companie at certaine prices, and to be deliuered them at times appointed, would bee otherwiſe brought into England, but onely by vertue and performance of the ſaid contracts; for, without this aſſurance of Vent, together with a good price for the ſaid monyes, the Merchants would vndoubtedly make their returnes in other wares;Tobacco, Rayſons, Oyles, and Wines, whereof there is no want, but rather too much Smoake. the vſe and extraordinarie conſume whereof, would be found leſſe profitable to the Commonwealth, when the matter ſhould be duly conſidered, as I ſhall yet further endeauour to demonſtrate.
                  And here I will ſuppoſe, That the Eaſt-India Company may ſhippe out yearely 100000. 
                        l
                      ſtarling (more or leſſe) as occaſion may be offered; yet it is moſt certaine, that the Trade being thus driuen, with ſuch ſums of ready moneys, it wil not decay but rather much increaſe the treaſure of the kingdome: which to proue, I will briefely ſet downe, the ſubſtance of the Engliſh Trade vnto the Eaſt-Indies, concerning the quantitie of the ſeuerall ſortes of wares, to be yearely bought there and ſould here: with the vſual prices giuen for them in both places. And

                     So that here would be our owne money againe; and more, the ſomme of 394223. 
                        l.
                      06. s̄. 08. 
                        d.
                      aduanced towards the generall

ſtocke of the Kingdome. For although the Eaſt-India company ſhall diſburſe the greateſt part of the ſayde ſomme aduanced vnto his Maieſtie for cuſtome and impoſt;2500. Tonnes of ſhipping wil lade home all the wares afore written from the Eaſt-Indies. And the materialls of the ſaid ſhipping (vnwrought) is worth about 15000l. ſterling and alſo vnto the Factors, Officers, and Marriners, for wages, together with the coſt of ſhipping Victualls, Munitions, Aſſurance and the like; yet all theſe (the Materialls of ſhipping only excepted) are but tranſmutations and no conſumption of the Kingdomes ſtocke.
                  But if any man obiect, and ſay, that the ſayd commodities being brought into England (as is before written) they are either conſumed in the land, or being tranſported into forren partes, they are changed into other wares; So that ſtill we want our 100000. l. in readie money:
                  1 The anſwere is; firſt, that in the occaſion of this diſpute, wee muſt conceaue the ſayd wares to be of no vſe for this kingdom, but onely for ſo much, as doe concerne the Trade thereof.
                  2 And Secondly, in the ſaid Trade, wee muſt conſider, that although the ſaid goodes be ſent out, and returned home in other wares from forren partes; yet ſtill, they are negotiated to the increaſe of the ſaid ſtocke, and for the imployment of the Subiects.
                  Laſtly, if there be a reſolution to determine

and end the buſineſſe: who doubteth, that the whole value,
                        India wares wil bring readie moneys into the Realme. may not be preſentlie returned hither in readie moneyes? For in Italy, Turkey, and other places, where they are moſt vendible to profit, there likewiſe is the money free to be exported at all times and by whomſoeuer.
                  And as it is moſt certen, that ſome other Merchandize, ſent out of this Kingdome were the meanes to bring in the 100000. l. in readie moneyes,We haue no other meanes to procure Treaſure but by Trade and Merchandize. which is here ſuppoſed to be ſent and imployed in the Eaſt-Indies (as aforeſaid) ſo likewiſe, there is the ſame power in theſe Indian wares, to procure other ſommes of ready moneyes, to be brought into this kingdome: For let no man doubt, but that money doth attend Merchandize, for money is the prize of wares, and wares are the proper vſe of money; ſo that their Coherence is vnſeparable.The French and the Venetians ſend the vallue of 600000. l. ſterling yeerely in ready money into Turkey.
                      And if the French and the Venetians, made any doubt of this, they would not ſo willingly permit the vallue of 600000. l. ſterling, or more in Spaniſh Rialls and Dollers, yearely to be carried out of their Dominions into Turkey: whereof three quarter partes at leaſt are imployed, onely for the buying of Perſia Raw-ſilkes, which commoditie doth preſently enable them with readie money from diuerſe other States to performe the Trade; whereby their wealth doth

much increaſe,Trade maketh ſome States very rich which haue little other meanes. and their people are greatly imployed. So to conclude this point, I will onely add, that the Eaſt-India Trade alone (although it be driuen in no amplier manner then is afore written) is a meanes to bring more treaſure into this Realme then al the other trades of this kingdome (as they are now mannaged) being put together.
                  For if the rule be true,If the generall Trade of this kingdome doth export a greater value in wares then it doth import yearely, then doth our treaſure increaſe that when the value of our commodyties exported doth ouer-ballance the worth of all thoſe forraigne wares which are imported and conſumed in this kingdome, then the remaynder of our ſtock which is ſent forth, muſt of neceſſitie returne to vs in Treaſure. I am confident that vpon a diligent and true inquiry it wil be found, that the ouerballance of all our other Trades together will not amount vnto ſo great a ſumme of money as the Eaſt-India Trade alone doth ouer ballance in this kinde.
                  And to make the matter yet more plaine,The trade to the Eaſt-Indies may be ſaid to export 480000 poundes and to importe 120000. l. yearely. So the ouerballance is 360000. poundes ſterling. whereas it is already ſaid that 100000. l. in money exported may import about the value of 500000. poundes ſterling, in wares from the Eaſt-Indies, wee muſt vnderſtand that part thereof to bee properly called our importation that this Realme doth cōſume, which is about the value of 120000. pounds ſterling yeerely. So the remainder being 380000. l. is matter exported vnto forraine

partes in the nature of our Cloath, Lead, Tinne, or any other natiue cōmodities, to the great increaſe of this kingdomes ſtocke; and that alſo in ſo much Treaſure, ſo farre as the Eaſt-India Trade can be rightly vnderſtood to ſubſiſt in this particular.
                  
                     Euery action ought eſpecially to be conſidered in his ende.For as all humane actions haue their termination and endes, ſo likewiſe there muſt be an end aſſigned vnto the affayres of the Eaſt-Indies; which are then truely ſayd to be finiſhed, when this Realme is ſerued, and the remaynder of thoſe wares which are ſent from hence beyond the Seas, ſould there and conuerted into money; which likewiſe from thence may be brought away freely & without the danger of Law or prohibition.
                  
                     The Eaſt-Indian wares which were ſent beyond the ſeas, are ſould and haue then finall end in money, which might be brought into this Realme in that kind, if our other Trades did not diuert the ſame.Foraſmuch therefore as it is well knowne to many men, that monyes are thus procured by the Sales of Indian wares to profit, in the partes of Turkey, and at Ligorne, Genoway, the Netherlands, Marcellis, and other places: yet notwithſtanding if all the ſaid coine, or any part thereof ſhould be diuerted from this Realme by ſome other new imployments or affaires, it muſt neuertheleſſe be granted, that the ſayd India wares had their finall end in moncies. But I will ceaſe to heape vp any more arguments, to proue a matter which is alreadie made ſo plaine; wherefore leauing this Obiection, I will endeauour to giue Anſwere to the next.
               
            
            
               
               The ſecond Obiection.
               The timber, Plancke, and other materialls, for making of ſhipping, is exceedinglie Waſted, and made dearer, by the building of ſo many great Shippes, as are yearely ſent to Trade in the Eaſt-Indies; and yet the State hath no vſe of any of them vpon occaſion; For either they are not here; or elſe they come home verie weake, and vnſeruiceable.
               
                  The Anſwere.
                  
                     THis Eaſt-India Trade ſeemeth to be borne and brought vp an Vnthrift, for it waſteth and conſumeth all; Neither doth it good to any.
                  
                     But the Obiection, in ſome part is verie weake:
                     And in the reſt it is miſtaken.
                  
                  For firſt,
                        The firſt part concerneth the folly of the Obiection. concerning the weakeneſſe thereof; would men haue vs to keepe our woods and goodly trees to looke vpon? they might aſwell forbid the working of our woolls, & ſending forth our cloth to forren partes; for

both are meanes alike, to procure the neceſſarie wares, which this Kingdome wanteth. Doe they not knowe that trees doe liue and growe▪ and being great, they haue a time to dye and rot, if oportunitie make no better vſe of them? and what more noble or profitable vſe then goodly Shipps for Trade & warre? are they not our barnes for wealth and plentie, ſeruing as walles and Bulwarkes for our peace and happines? Doe not their yearely buildings maintaine many hundred poore people, and greatlie increaſe the number of thoſe Arteſmen which are ſo needfull for this common wealth?
                  
                     The prouidence of the Eaſt-India company for timber and Planke.And is not all this good performed alſo (with great prouidence) by bringing in yearelie ſtore of Tymber, and other prouiſions from Ireland? Why then, where is the great waſt and dearneſſe? I am ſure, the Eaſt-India Companie findes it not; for whereas they doe only buy their prouiſions in Hampſhire,
                     The Eaſt-India Trade hath not indeared the materialls which ſerue to make Shippes 
                     Eſſex, Kent, and Barkeſhire, in all which places they now may haue both Timber, Planks, Sheathing boards, Trenalls, and the like, both for goodnes and price, as cheape (yea better cheape) then they haue bin this fifteene yeers; and likewiſe in all that courſe of time their Bookes doe plainely ſhew that thoſe wares haue neuer varied much; for if they haue riſen any ſmal matter in one yeare they haue fallen as much the next. And yet I

pray you obſerue (beſides the Eaſt-India Companies buildings) the many goodlie ſhippes, which are daily made for other priuate Merchants (ſuch as England neuer had before:) & that which is moſt remarkable, is, the continuall late buildings of his Maieſtie, thereby yearely adding more ſtrength and glory of great Shippes, to his Royall and matchleſſe Nauy; ſo that, here wee ſee this ſuppoſed waſt and want is not conſiderable.
                  Yea but, ſay they,
                        The ſecond Part ſheweth the miſtaking in the Obiection the Eaſt-India Shippes are neuer here, to ſerue the Kingdome vpon occaſion: Or if they beat home, they are weake, and vnfit for ſeruice.
                  In trade of Merchandize our Shippes muſt goe and come, they are not made to ſtay at home; Yet neuertheleſſe, the Eaſt-India companie are well prepared at all times,The warlike prouiſion which the Eaſt-India Companie keepe in ſtore to ſerue his Maieſtie, and his Kingdomes, with many warlike prouiſions, which they alwayes keep in ſtore; ſuch as Timber, Plancks, Iron-workes, Maſts, Cordage, Anchors, Caſke, Ordinance, Powder, Shot, Victualls readie packed, Wine, Sider, and a world of other things, fitting the preſent building, repairing and diſpatch of Shippes to Sea; as may bee plentifullie ſeene in their yardes and ſtorehouſes at Deptforde, and more eſpeciallie in thoſe at Blackewalle; which are growne ſo famous, that they are daily viſited & viewed by ſtrangers, as well Embaſſadors, as others;

to their great admiration of his Maieſties ſtrength,His Maieſties ſtrength in the Eaſt-India Company alone. & glorie, in one only Company of his Merchants, able at ſhort warning to ſet forth a fleete of Ships of great force & power.
                  For it is well knowne to al men who pleaſe truely to be informed, That the Eaſt-India Companie (beſides their fleetes of Shippes going and comming & alſo abiding in the Indies) are continuallie building, repairing, rigging, victualling, and furniſhing to Sea, with all prouiſion needefull for ſuch a long voyage, ſome 7. or 8. great ſhippes yearelie; which are to be ſeene at an Anchor in the Riuer of Thames in a great forwardnes ſome 5. or .6. moneths together, before they commonly depart for the Indies, which is about the moneth of March: & they are no ſooner got off from the coaſt of England, but ſhortly after, is the ſeaſon of our ſhips to returne from the Indies; who come not home ſo weake as ſome would haue them; for how often hath experience bin made of our ſhippes which haue performed 2. or .3. ſeueral voyages to the Eaſt-Indies? Yet at their returne, they haue bin indocked,The ſhippes which returne from the Eaſt-Indies home, may be repayred in a very ſhort time. new trimmed and lanched out againe, fitted for the like voyages, in leſſe then 2. moneths. But it will be needeleſſe to ſpend any more time in ſhewing the errors of this 2. Obiection: therfore I will rather come to the handling of that which followeth.
               
            
            
               
               The third Obiection.
               The voyages to the Eaſt Indies doe greatly conſume our victuals, and our Marriners: leauing many poore Widdowes and Children vnrelieued; Beſides, that many Ships are yearely ſent forth to the Eaſt Indies, and few we ſee as yet returned; Alſo, this Trade hath greatly decayed the Traffique and ſhipping, which were wont to be imployed into the Streights: And yet the ſaid Trade to the Eaſt Indies, is found very vnprofitable to the Aduenturers: Neither doth the Common-wealth finde any benefit by the cheapeneſſe of Spice and Indico, more then in times paſt.
               
                  The Anſwer.
                  Why, what a world of miſchiefes haue we heere?
                  
                     1. Dearth.
                     
                     2. Mortalitie.
                     
                     3. Deſtruction.
                     
                     4. Beggerie.
                     
                     5. And neuer a whit the neere.
                     
                  
                  A verie Teame of calamities, drawing on to miſerie; is it not then high time to ſeeke a remedie? yes verily, and it will be eaſily done, becauſe theſe euils neuer were (as yet at leaſt) procured by the Eaſt India Trade, as I ſhall ſhew, by anſwering all the parts in order as they ſtand: and firſt of Dearth.
                  
                  It is both naturall and iuſt, that euery Kingdome,The firſt Part concerneth Dearth. State, or Common-wealth, ſhould feede and

cheriſh vp the Natiue people of all degrees and conditions whatſoeuer, to their preſeruation of life and health, with ſuch meanes and moderation, as their plentie ſhall affoord; and this is not onely due to them in the time of their aboad at home, but alſo vpon all occaſions of voyages into other Countries beyond the Seas, wherein they ſhall be imployed for their owne maintenance, and for the good of the Common-wealth.
                  
                     The manner how the Eaſt India Company do victuall their ſhips.Now therefore concerning the prouiſion of victuals (which in this Kingdome is yearely prepared for the ſetting forth of thoſe Ships which ſaile to the Eaſt Indies,) it is well knowen to many men, that it is alwaies proportioned, for about eighteene months; whereas commonly the voyages proue a yeare longer, ſo that this ouer-plus of time, is furniſhed with the victuals of forreine parts.
                  And likewiſe for the Bread and Bisket which is ſhipped from hence, hath it not alwaies beene made of French Corne, purpoſly brought ouer hither (and that at a deare rate) onely to preſerue the plentie of our owne graine? vntill now of late daies that the Farmers heere beginne to cry out and ſay, That the cheapneſſe of Corne doth diſinable them to pay their deare Rents: Thus doe the Eaſt India Company euerie way accommodate their proceedings for the good of the Kingdome.
                  And further concerning their Drinke, is it not a very great part water? Some Wine and Sider, and but little Beere.
                  
                     Alſo the Fleſh they eate, is Beefe and Porke, and that onely for three daies in a weeke; the reſt of their victuals is Fiſh, ſome Butter, Cheeſe, Peaſe, Oatemale, and other things; all which is proportioned into a very ſparing dyet to euerie man by allowance: ſo that heere is no exceſſe nor ryot, or any other meanes to make our victuals ſcant and deare, as is by ſome erroniouſly ſuppoſed; but rather by this courſe of life, our plentie is much aduanced. And ſo I will giue anſwer to the next part which is mortalitie and great decay of Marriners.
                  The life of man is ſo pretious,The Second Part concerneth Mortality that it ought not lightly to be expoſed to danger; And yet we know, that the whole courſe of our life, is nothing but a paſſage vnto Death; wherein one can neither ſtay nor ſlacke his pace, but all men runne in one manner, and in one celeritie; The ſhorter liuer runnes his courſe no faſter then the long, both haue a like paſſage of time; howbeit, the firſt hath not ſo farre to runne as the later.
                  Now, it is this length of life which Nature ſeekes, and States likewiſe endeauour to preſerue in worthy men; but none are accounted ſo worthy in this nature, ſaue onely they, who labour in their vocations and functions, both for the publique good, and for their priuate benefit.
                  Thus may we eſteeme our good Marriners,Good Marriners are accounted worthy men in a Common-wealth. to be of no ſmall vſe vnto this Common-wealth: but take them from their laudable and accuſtomed imployments, for want of voyages to Sea; wee ſee what deſperate courſes they doe then attempt,

by ioyning, euen with Turkes and Infidels, to rob and ſpoyle all Chriſtian Nations; ſo that we may conclude, we muſt not onely breed vp Marriners, but alſo ſeeke by Trade, to giue them maintenance.
                  Well, all this is true, but (ſay they) the Eaſt India company doth neither breed nor maintaine, but deſtroy the wonted number of our Marriners.
                  How can this be, when it is moſt certaine, that England (beſides the Eaſt India fleets) had neuer yet more ſhipping then at this preſent? neither do any of them ſtay at home for want of Marriners, no, not at this time, when many hundred Saylers are employed in extraordinary ſeruice, for his Maieſtie in a Royall fleete of ſhips, now at Sea: beſides thoſe great numbers of our beſt Marriners, which haue beene and dayly are waſted and taken priſoners by the Turkes; ſo where is this want, or what is our miſery more then the want of true information in them that are ſo ill perſwaded of our company?
                  Is it not certaine, that as the Eaſt India voyages are long,The breeding of 400. Marriners yearely. Beſides that the feare of a few mens death ought not to ouerthrow or hinder the performance of honourable actions for the ſeruice of the King and cōmonwealth. ſo likewiſe in Natures courſe many ſhould die by length of time although they ſtayd at home? And to recompence the loſſe of thoſe that dye, doe not the Eaſt India company with great prouidence, yearly ſhip out at leaſt 400. Landmen in their fleets, which in one voyage proue good Marriners to ſerue the Kingdome and Common wealth, vnto which many of them were a burthen before they obtained this employment? And thus is the Kingdome purged of deſperate and vnruly people, who being kept in awe by the good diſcipline at Sea, do

often change their former courſe of life, and ſo aduance their fortunes.
                  Neither indeed are theſe voyages ſo dangerous and mortall, as is reported; for how many of our ſhips, haue gone and come from the Eaſt Indies, without the loſſe of fiue men in a hundreth?Our Marriners owne diſordered life is that which killeth many of them. Others againe haue had worſe ſucceſſe in the firſt beginning, when the ſeaſons, the places and their contagions were not ſo well knowne vnto vs; yet time hath taught vs many things, both for the preſeruation of health, and ſpeedier performance of our voyage thē heretofore. But the Method of my diſcourſe bids me write more of this in the next part, which is deſtruction; and this I muſt diuide into two parts.
                  In the firſt I will conſider the want of diuers ſhips ſent to the Eaſt Indies, which are waſted there.
                  And in the ſecond, I will anſwer the ſuppoſed ouerthrow of the Turkie trade, together with much of our ſhipping which were wont to bee employed thither.
                  Firſt therefore concerning the decay of our ſhips in the Indies, it cannot be denyed,The third Part concernes the decay of ſhipping which haue beene ſent to the Indies. but there hath been great ſpoyle of them in theſe three laſt yeares; not by the dangers of the Seas, or by the ſtrength of enemies; but by vnkinde and vnexſpected quarrels with our neighbours the Hollanders, who haue taken and ſurpriſed twelue of our ſhips at ſeuerall times, and in ſundry places, to our vnſpeakeable loſſe and hinderance; together with the death of many of our worthyeſt Marriners,Our troubles with the Dutch who haue beene ſlaine and died priſoners vnder their hands: and this hath ſo much the more 
                        〈…〉
                      the rumour of

their mortality: Neither liſt I here to aggrauate the fact, more thē thus breifly to giue anſwer to the obiection: for our late vnion with the Dutch, doth promiſe a double recompence of gain in time to come.
                  And they who make this Trade ſo poore and vnprofitable, are much miſtaken in the reckoning; for the preſent loſſes which cauſeth many aduenturers ſo much to deſpaire, is not in the ſubſtance of the Trade, but by the euill accidents which hane befalne the ſame: & to make this point more plain, I muſt yet declare ſome other particulars: in which I will endeauour very briefly to ſet downe the ſumme of the whole buſineſſe, which the Engliſh hath hitherto performed in the Eaſt Indies.
                  
                  Firſt, therefore I doe obſerue that ſince the beginning of this Trade, vntill the Moneth of Iuly laſt Anno 1620.The ſumme of the affaires to the Eaſt Indies euer ſince the Trade began. there haue beene ſent thither 79. ſhips in ſeuerall voyages, whereof 34. are already come home in ſafety richly laden, 4. haue beene worne out by long ſeruice, from port to port in the Indies: 2. were ouerwhelmed in the trimming there: 6. haue beene caſt away by the perils of the Seas; 12. haue beene taken and ſurprized by the Dutch, whereof diuers will be waſted, and little worth before they be reſtored: and 21. good ſhips do ſtill remaine in the Indies. So this is a true account of our ſhips.
                  
                     Account of all the money and goods which hath been ſent to the Eaſt Indies euer ſince the beginning of the Trade.And next concerning our ſtocke, it is a certaine truth, that in all the ſayde ſhips there hath beene ſent out in ready money as well out of this Realme, as from all other places whereſoeuer beyond the Sea (which hath not been landed in this Kingdom) the vallue of 548090. pounds ſterling in forraine

coine; and together with the ſayd money there hath beene ſhipped the vallue of 292286. pounds ſterling in ſundry ſorts of Engliſh and forraine commodities; all which moneys and wares amounting vnto 840376. pounds, haue been diſpoſed as hereafter followeth.
                  Firſt, there hath been loſt 31079. pounds ſterling in the 6. ſhips which are caſt away: and in the 34. ſhips, which are returned in ſafety, there hath beene brought home 356288.356288. l. ſterling hath been returned from the Eaſt Indies which did produce here towards charges 1914600. ſterling. pounds ſterling in diuers ſorts of wares, which haue produced here in Englād towards the generall ſtocke thereof 1914600. l. ſterling; for the charges ariſing here, is but a change of effects from one to another, as hath beene ſayde before in this diſcourſe: So there ought to remaine in the Indies, to be ſpeedily returned hither, 484088 pounds: neither can we conceiue that our charges and troubles with the Dutch, wil haue waſted more then the odd 84088. pounds ſterling: ſo that I am confident, that there yet remaineth 400000 pounds ſterling of good eſtate, for both the ioynt ſtockes.There remains yet in the Eaſt Indies to be returned home from thence about 400000 l. ſtarling. And what a great value of Indian goods this ſum of mony may (by Gods bleſſing) ſhortly return in our ſhips, which are there ready to bring thē, the example here doth teach vs to make vp the reckoning. So that notwithſtanding our great charges of diſcoueries, our loſſes by the danger of the ſeas, our quarrels & infinit hinderance by the Dutch: yet here the kingdome hath and ſhall haue her ſtocke againe with a very great encreaſe, although the Merchants gaines concerning the two ioynt ſtocks will proue but poore, in reſpect of the former voyages, which haue not had the like hinderance.
                  
                     And thus in a few lines may be ſeene, much matter truly collected with ſome paines, out of the diuers volumes of the Eaſt Indian Bookes.
                  
                     Concerning the decay of ſhipping and Trade into Turkey.Now concerning the decay of Trade and ſhipping which were wont to be imployed into Turkey, I doubt, that in time it will likewiſe be affirmed, that the Eaſt India Company, haue hindred the vent of our white Cloath in the Netherlands, which to report were a verie ſtrange thing. But (praiſed be God) to our comfort, we ſee the great increaſe of goodly Ships, daily built and imployed, by the Turkey Merchants with vent of more of our Engliſh Cloath (by one third part at leaſt) then in times before the Eaſt India trade began.
                  Yea, but (ſay they) we haue loſt the trade of Spices, and Indico, from Aleppo into England.
                  
                  Well, I grant they haue; yet the Kingdome hath found it with more profit by another way; and they likewiſe are recompenced with a greater Trade, by the exporting from hence of the ſelfe-ſame commodities into Italy, Turkey, and other places: neither can it be leſſe profitable for this kingdome, to turne the Trade of Raw-Silkes from Aleppo, and to bring them from the Perſian gulfe, with one third part leſſe money, then it doth now coſt in Turkey; Beſides, that by this meanes, the money proceeding of our Engliſh Cloath, Tin, and other wares in Turkey (not finding commodities ſitting to returne for England) would vndoubtedly be brought home in Gold, as it hath beene performed heretofore, when by ſuperfluitie of ſtocke ſent from hence in Spice, together with our Engliſh wares; the

Merchants (being thereby furniſhed with a ſufficient quantitie of Turkiſh cōmodities) brought home the remainder of their ſtocke of thoſe yeares in gold for a great value.The Turkey Merchants can and will iuſtify this truth.
                  
                  Thus doth it plainely appeare, that theſe reuolutions of Trades, haue and doe turne to the good of the Commonwealth; neither hath the affayres of the Eaſt Indies impaired or decayed any other Trade, Shipping or Marriners of this Realme; but hath mightily increaſed them all in it ſelfe. Wherefore let vs now take a view of this noble addition of the kingdomes ſtrength and glory.
                  But this I muſt not doe, by ſetting downe the number of our Engliſh ſhipping row in the Indies, or lately gone that way; for they haue beene heaped thither, theſe three laſt yeares together without returne, ſaue onely fiue ſhips in all that time; the reſt haue beene kept there to oppoſe the furie of the Dutch; but now we are at vnion, we ſhall (by Gods aſſiſtance) dayly exſpect diuers great ſhips with rich returnes.
                  And for the future time,The ſtrength of the Eaſt India ſhips. this Trade I doe conceiue, will royally maintayne ten thouſand tuns of ſhipping continually: (That is to ſay) going, and returning, and abiding there in the Indies; which ſaid ſhipping will employ two thouſand and fiue hundred Marriners at leaſt; and the building with the repayring of the ſayde ſhips, here at home will ſet to worke fiue hundred men, Carpenters, Cawkers, Caruers, Ioiners, Smiths, & other laborers, beſides many officers; and about 120. Factors, in ſeuerall

of the Indies. And ſo from theſe matters of great conſequence, I muſt beginne to write of Beggery.
                  
                     The fourth Part concernes the pouerty of widdowes, &c·The pouertie of Widdowes and Fatherleſſe is matter of great compaſſion, and doth alwaies moue Chriſtian hearts to commiſeration and charitie; whereby many receiue reliefe & helpe of thoſe whō God hath bleſſed with better meanes: but how this pouertie ſhould totally be preuented, it ſeemeth not onely difficult, but altogether impoſſible: For beſides the euill accidents and miſeries, which euer attend on our humanity, we ſee how many dayly (euen through their owne folly & wilfulneſſe) do as it were deſperately plunge themſelues into aduerſitie. And thus the number of thoſe is great, who hauing the charge of wife & children, are notwithſtanding altogether without meanes and artes to procure their maintenance; whereby ſome of them, wanting grace, do run a deſperat courſe, & haue vntimely ends.The Eaſt India Trade doth employ many poore men, & deboiſt people which other trades refuſe Others again, being better inſpired, ſeek for imployment, but find it not, or with great difficulty: for, who doth willingly entertain a man poore and miſerable, charged with a family, and peraduenture debauched in conditions? Neither doe any of our other Merchants voyages to forraine parts accept of thoſe nouices who neuer haue been vſed to the Sea:Wages before hand is not giuen in other Merchants voyages, neither yet ſo great wages as the Eaſt India company pay. So that when all the other doores of charitie are ſhut, the Eaſt India gates ſtand wide open to receiue the needy and the poore, giuing them good entertainment with two Moneths wages before hand to make their neeedfull prouiſions for the voyage: And in the time of their abſence, there is likewiſe payd vnto their wiues for maintenance, two

other months wages vpon accompt of euery yeares ſeruice: and alſo if any chance to dye in the voyage, the wife receiueth all that is found due vnto her husband (if hee doe not otherwiſe diſpoſe it by will:) and this often happeneth to be more money then euer they had of their owne together in any one time.
                  And likewiſe, are not many poore Widdowes,When did any of theſe widdowes beg for reliefe in our Churches as others often doe? Wiues and Children of Blacke-wall, Lime-houſe, Ratcliffe, Shadwell, and Wapping, often relieued by the Eaſt India company with whole Hogſheads of good Biefe and Porke, Bisket and doales of ready money? Are not diuers of their children ſet on worke to picke Okam,The Eaſt India company their charity. & other labours fitting their age and capacitie? What might I not ſay of repayring of Churches, maintenance of ſome yong Schollers, relieuing of many poore Preachers of the Goſpell yearely with good ſummes of money; and diuers other acts of charitie, which are by them religiouſly performed, euen in the times now of their worſt fortunes? for all which I hope there ſhal be a reward vnto them and theirs. And ſo I come to the fift part of this third Obiection.
                  And here I muſt intimate how much they are deceiued who thinke that Spices and Indico are no better cheape in England now, then in times paſt,The fift Part concerneth the cheapneſſe of Spice and Indico at this present in reſpect of former times. before the Eaſt India trade began.
                  For, it is an vndoubted truth, that in thoſe dayes we often payd 6. ſhillings or more for a pound of Pepper, and ſeldome or neuer leſſe then three ſhillings and ſixe pence the pound; whereas ſince the Trade hath come directly from the Indies, it hath

beene bought commonly at ſeuerall prices betweene 16. pence and two ſhillings the pound; but I will make the difference of price appeare more plainely by ſetting downe the quantities of Spices and Indico, which are yearely ſpent in the Realme of England, together with the loweſt prices, which they were wont to ſell at, when wee brought them from Turkey and Lixborne; and the like concerning their vſuall prices now that wee bring them from the Eaſt Indies directly; And firſt as from Turkey.

                     So that this Trade in Spice and Indico onely, doth ſaue the Kingdome yearly 74966. l. 13. s. 04. d. which is a matter worthy to be obſerued; and ſo much the rather, becauſe it is a certaine truth,Leſſe then 18. thouſand pounds ſterling in the Indies, will buy Spice and Indico to ſerue this Realme for a yeare, which is not halte ſo much money as it ſpendeth beyond the ſeas to buy Currans onely, or to buy Tobacco. that leſſe then a quarter part of this ſum of mony which is thus ſaued yearely, ſhall buy in the Indies the full quantitie of all the ſeuerall ſorts of wares before written, which doe ſerue for a yeares prouiſion for this Realme of England; but ſtill, it muſt be remembred, that the cuſtome, impoſt, wages, victuals, ſhipping, and other charges (which are to be added) will be a greater ſumme, then the mony which is paid for theſe wares in the Indies; but as I haue noted before, the ſaid charges doe not conſume the Kingdomes ſtocke, although it doth greatly abate the Merchants gaine.
                  And to conclude this point,The wares only which are ſent out of this kingdome into the Eaſt Indies are of ſufficient value to 
                           〈…〉
                         this Realme

                         Indian wares, Perſian Raw Silkes only accepted) I will adde vnto that which hath beene ſaid; that the commodities onely which we now ſend yearely into the Eaſt Indies and Perſia, are of ſufficient value there to returne vs Indico, Spices, Drugs, and all other ſorts of Indian wares, (Raw-Silkes of Perſia only excepted) for one yeares conſume, or more in this Kingdome; So that now all the money which is ſent forth in our Ships doth procure an ouer-plus of the ſaid wares to the furtherance of Trade from India hither, and after from hence to forreine parts againe, to the great imployment of the Subiects, and inriching of this Realme, both in Stocke and Treaſure; all which is matter very worthy to be diligently obſerued; And ſo I come to giue anſwere vnto the fourth and laſt Obiection.
               
            
            
               
               The fourth Obiection.
               It is generally obſerued that his Maieſties Mint hath had but little imployment euer ſithence the Eaſt India Trade began; Wherefore it is manifeſt, that the onely remedie for this, and ſo many euils beſides, is to put downe this Trade: For what other remedie can there be for the good of the Common-wealth?
               
                  The Anſwer.
                  This fourth obiection may be deuided into three parts:

                        1. An euill declared.
                        
                        2. A remedie propounded.
                        
                        3. And counſell demaunded.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     The firſt Part concerneth his Maieſties MintAnd firſt concerning the Euill or want of Siluer, I thinke it hath beene, and is a generall diſeaſe of all Nations, and ſo will continue vntill the end of the world; for poore and rich complaine they neuer haue enough: but it ſeemeth the maladie is growen mortall here with vs, and therefore it cries out for remedie: Well, I hope it is but imagination maketh vs ſicke,25000. pounds waight at leaſt of Siluer yearely melted down into Plate, beſides old Plate new faſhioned, as by credible report. when all our parts be ſound and ſtrong; For who knoweth not the ineſtimable treaſure of this Kingdome in Plate poſſeſſed by the people thereof almoſt of all degrees; in ſuch meaſure, as neuer hath beene ſeene in former ages?
                  And for his Maieſties Mint, it is well knowne, that there hath beene coyned in fiue yeares together

ſince the Eaſt India Company began, 6214.There hath bin coyned great ſtore of Gold & Siluer in his Maieſties Mint ſince the Eaſt India Trade began. pounds waight of Gold, and 311384. pound waight of ſterling Money; all which Gold and Siluer doe amount vnto the ſumme of 1213850. pounds of ſterling Money; How then doth this Trade turne the currant and imployment of the Mint?
                  But vpon the ſight of this truth, perhaps it will be ſaid, That wee muſt reſort vnto the preſent times, (the Mint being idle now.)
                  To which I anſwer, That likewiſe the Mint had little or no imployment for coynage of Siluer in former times,There hath bin little or no Siluer coyned in ſome yeares, when the Eaſt India Company ſent out very ſmall ſums of money. when the ſaid Company did not export aboue fifteene or twenty thouſand pounds ſterling at the moſt per annum; no, nor yet in the yeares 1608. and 1612: when in the former they ſhipped out but 6000.l.—00. s.—00d. and in the latter, but 1250.l.—00. s.—00.d. ſterling. So that both waies we ſee, that the Mint hath had very great imployment fiue yeares together, ſithence the Eaſt India Trade began; and alſo it hath beene without imployment diuers yeares, when the Eaſt India Company haue ſent away but very ſmall ſummes of money; wherefore of neceſſitie there muſt be ſome other cauſes and meanes whereby our Siluer is not exported onely, but alſo it is not imported into the Realme as in former times. For we haue not had the meanes by our owne plentie, not by the ſcarſitie of our neighbours, (for the ſpace of the laſt foureteene yeares together) to ſend out hundreds of Ships laden with Corne, as in times paſt which was returned home in Siluer;

but rather of late yeares (as is much to be feared) a great quantitie of our money hath beene carried out of the Kingdome,Some cauſes and meanes which were wont to bring Siluer into the Realme, are ceaſed at this preſent time. for that Corne which hath beene brought vs from the Eaſt Countries, and other places, to ſupply our wants. Thus times doe change, and our fortunes change with them: neither liſt I to make this matter plainer, by ſetting downe thoſe meanes, which heretofore brought vs ſtore of money, euen out of France and other places, which now are ceaſed. But without any further medling in the Mint, I will come to the remedie which ſome propound, by putting downe the Eaſt India Company.
                  
                     The Second Part concerneth the putting downe of the Eaſt India Trade.But heere our comfort is, that the Obiectors are not our Iudges, whoſe wiſedome and integritie labouring for the honour of his Maieſtie, and the good of his Kingdome, will ſoone perceiue the miſchiefes of this ſuppoſed remedie. And that the pretended euill which many with malice chaſe, is that great good, which other Nations ſeeke by pollicie and ſtrength to keepe,The Eaſt-India Trade is greatly deſired by other Chriſtian Nations. and likewiſe to obtaine; In which proceedings, it concerneth vs, eſpecially to obſerue the diligences and practiſes of the Dutch; who with more gladneſſe would vndertake the whole Trade to the Eaſt Indies, then with any reaſon we can abandon that part thereof, which we now enioy; neither can our reſtraint from the Indies keepe our Siluer from thence, as long as the Dutch goe thither: for we know, that deuices want not to furniſh ſuch deſſignes; and when their Ships returne from India, ſhall not our Siluer our againe to helpe to pay a double price, or what they pleaſe,

for all thoſe wares which we ſhall want for our neceſſities?
                  Thus ſhould the Dutch increaſe their honour,The Dutch might grow ſtrong and rich by our deſtruction. wealth and ſtrength, whileſt we abate, grow poore and weake at Sea for want of Trade; and call you this a Remedie; no, rather tearme it Ruine, Deſtruction, or what you liſt; And ſo I come vnto the concluſion or laſt part.
                  And here I muſt confeſſe my ſelfe aground,The Third Part concerneth the councel which the Obiecters demaund. for this matter is much too high for my handling: beſides, my excuſe is faire, hauing alreadie done my taske to cleare the Eaſt India Trade from imputation; the which, for want of learning, although I haue performed, without varietie of words or eloquence: yet it is done with all integritie of truth, in euery particular, as I ſhall be readie to make proofe vpon all occaſions, which may bee offered.
                  And yet before I make an end, although I cannot ſatisfie euery mans deſire, in ſuch meaſure as is neceſſarie: yet I thinke it not amiſſe to performe the ſame ſo farre as I am able by common practiſe, and my obſeruations in the Trade of Merchandize, which is my profeſſion.
                  And firſt therefore, all men doe know, that the riches or ſufficiencie of euery Kingdome, State, or Common-wealth, conſiſteth in the poſſeſſion of thoſe things, which are needfull for a ciuill life.
                  This ſufficiency is of two ſorts: the one is naturall, and proceedeth of the Territorie it ſelfe:The riches of a Kingdome is of two ſorts.
                     
the other is artificiall, and dependeth on the induſtry of the Inhabitants.
                  The Realme of England (praiſed be God) is happily poſſeſſed of them both: as firſt, hauing great plentie of naturall riches, both in the Sea for Fiſh, & on the Land for Wooll, Cattle, Corne, Lead, Tin, Iron, and many other things for food, Rayment & Munition; inſomuch, that vpon ſtrickt tearmes of need, this land may liue without the help of any other Nation.
                  But to liue well, to flouriſh and grow rich, we muſt finde meanes, by Trade to vent our ſuperfluities; therewith to furniſh and adorne vs with the Treaſure and thoſe neceſſarie wares, which forreine Nations doe afford:This kind of induſtry maketh ſome Countries which are poor in themſelues, to grow rich and ſtrong by other Nations, who haue greater meanes, and are leſſe induſtrious. and here induſtrie muſt begin to play his part, not onely to increaſe and guide the Trades abroad; but alſo to maintaine and multiply the Arts at home: for when either of theſe faile, or are not effected with ſuch skill as their myſterie ſhall require, then doth the Common-wealth abate & growes poore; neither is this eaſily perceiued at firſt, vntill ſome euill accidents doe ſtirre vp our diligence to ſearch out the true cauſes, that ſo they being remoued, the effects may ceaſe. And this is the ſubiect of our diſcourſe which we now purſue.
                  That which I haue hitherto deliuered, hath beene altogether Negatiue, ſtill defending and prouing by arguments, that the Eaſt India Trade hath not hurt: this Common-wealth; And now changing my ſtile, I muſt affirme as faſt the true cauſes of thoſe euils which we ſeeke to chaſe away.
                  
                     Theſe cauſes then (as I conceiue) are principally foure.Foure Principall Cauſes which carry away our Gold and Siluer.
                  
                  1. The firſt is the breach of Entercourſe by forraine Nations.
                  2. The ſecond is the abuſe of the exchanges betwixt vs and other Countries.
                  3. The third is neglect of dutie in ſome Subiects.
                  4 The fourth is our dammage in Commerce with Strangers.
                  Now concerning all theſe, I might make a very large diſcourſe; but my purpoſe is only to explane the meaning of euery point in order, as briefely as I can.
                  And firſt for the breach of Entercourſe;The Firſt Cauſe concerneth the Standard. by this I vnderſtand thoſe Nations, who haue eyther debaſed their Standard, or elſe ouer-valued the price of their Coynes from that equiualence which formerly they had with the Standard and Moneys of this Realme; And alſo doe tollerate, not onely their owne Moneys,Proceeding againſt entercourſe. but alſo the Coyne of other Countries (and eſpecially of this Kingdome) to bee currant with them at higher rates, then the prizes of the Exchange; by which courſes (being directly againſt the Entercourſe) there is a greater cauſe giuen of exportation of the Moneys of this Realme, then otherwiſe there would be. For although this is done with great danger to the exporters of the ſame, (it being an acte againſt the Law of the Land) yet notwithſtanding Couetouſneſſe,

being euer conuerſant in wicked actions, thinketh nothing vnlawfull, which promiſeth a certaine gaine; and how to remedie this euill practiſe I finde it not eaſie. For the debaſing of the Coyne, or raiſing the price thereof in this Realme, would much impoueriſh the eſtates of particular men, and yet in the concluſion, would proue a buſineſſe without end: for who doth not conceiue that which would follow beyond the Seas vpon any ſuch alteration here with vs? ſo that ſtill the euill will remaine, vntill we find ſome other remedie.
                  
                     The Second Cauſe concerneth the Exchanges of moneys with forreine Countries.And for the exchanges of money, vſed betwixt Nations, although the true vſe thereof, is a very lawdable and neceſſarie practiſe, for the accommodating of Merchants affaires, and furniſhing of Trauellers in their occaſions, without the tranſporting of Coyne from one State to another, with danger and loſſe, both to the publique and priuate wealth; yet is the abuſe thereof verie preiudiciall vnto this Kingdome in particuler; whileſt in the interim the benefit doth ariſe vnto other Countries, who diligently obſeruing the prizes whereby the monies bee exchanged,The practiſe of thoſe ſtrangers here in this Realme, who make a Trade by Exchange of moneys. may take aduantage, to carrie away the Gold and Siluer of this Realme at thoſe times, when the rate of our ſterling money (in Exchange) is vnder the value of that Standard, vnto which place they are conueyed; For in reſpect the prizes of the Exchanges, doe riſe and fall according to the plentie or ſcarſitie of money, which is to be

taken vp or deliuered out, the exchange is hereby become rather a Trade for ſome great monyed men, then a furtherance and accomodation of reall Trade to Merchants, as it ought to be in the true vſe thereof.
                  And thus many times money may be made ouer hither by ſtrangers, to a good gaine, and preſently carried beyond the Seas to a ſecond profite, and yet the miſchefe ends not here: for by this means the takers vp of money in forraine Countreys muſt neceſſarily driue a Trade to thoſe places,Forraine wares brought in with our ready moneys carryed out of this Realme· from whence they draw their moneys; and ſo doe fill vs vp with forraine Commodities, without the vent of our owne wares, but for this great euill, there is an eaſie remedie, and ſo I come to handle the next cauſe which is neglect of Dutie.
                  Neither is it my intent to write of Duties in their ſeuerall kindes;The third cauſe concerneth neglect of duties. but onely of that kinde of duty which is here thought to bee neglected by ſome men in their ſeuerall vocations. As it might peraduenture come to paſſe, in thoſe who haue the working of his Maieſties coyne, either gold or ſiluer: if diligent care be not had in the ſize of euery ſeuerall peece, to anſwer iuſtly to his weight: for howſoeuer vpon triall of many peeces altogether, the weight may bee found according to the couenants, and within the remedies ordained in the Indentures:Our heauy money is conueyed beyond the ſeas and melted downe here in the realme. Yet notwithſtanding many of thoſe peeces may be ſized too light, & others as much too heauy; which giueth the greater aduantage to ſome people, to carry away that which is ouer-weight, and ſo to

leaue vs them which are too light, if they leaue vs any.
                  And this miſchiefe is not ſingle; for thereby alſo ſome Goldſmiths, regarding profit more then dutie, may bee the more readily drawne to melt downe the heauy Coyne into Plate and other ornaments both of gold and ſiluer.
                  But what might wee thinke of thoſe men who are placed in authoritie and office for his Maieſtie, if they ſhould not with all dutifull care diſcharge their truſt concerning that excellent Statute,Anno 17. Edw. 4. where in it is ordered, that all the moneys receiued by ſtrangers for their Merchandiſe, ſhall be employed vpon the commodities of this Realme? the due performance whereof would not onely preuent the carrying away of much gold and ſiluer, but alſo be a meanes of greater vent of our owne wares: whereof I purpoſe to write ſomething more in the next part which concerneth our commerce with ſtrangers.
                  
                     The fourth cauſe concerneth our cō
                        merce with ſtrangers.And now I come to the laſt point, which I feare is not the leaſt amongſt the cauſes of our want of money (ſo farre as any ſuch may bee:) and let it not ſeeme ſtrange to any man, that Trades ſhould hurt and impoueriſh a Commonwealth, ſince it hath beene alwayes accompted an excellent means to helpe and enrich the ſame: for, as this truth cannot be denyed with reaſon, ſo it is likewiſe moſt certain,Vnskilfull Merchants ouerthrow our Trades. that the vnskilfull managing thereof hath euer prooued a great decay vnto thoſe nations who haue been entangled with ſuch errors. And are not

the examples too frequent in many of our owne Merchants, who not onely by the perils of the Seas and ſuch like misfortunes, loſe their goods, but alſo euen through want of knowledge, wiſely to direct their affaires, doe ouerthrow their whole eſtates: neither may we properly call this their loſſe, but rather the kingdomes loſſe in them. Wherefore it were to be wiſhed, that this myſterie of Merchandiſing might be left only to them,Merchants by education are onely fit to trade in forren parts. who haue had an education thereunto; and not to be vndertaken by ſuch, who leauing their proper vocations, doe for want of skill in this, both ouerthrow themſelues & others who are better practiſed.
                  But there is yet a farre greater miſchiefe by our Trades beyond the Seas, when peraduenture, there might be imported yearely a greater value in forraine wares, then by any way or meanes we doe export of our owne commodities;How rich cō
                        monwealths may become poore. which cannot otherwiſe come to paſſe, then with a manifeſt impoueriſhing of the Commonwealth; for as it is a certain cauſe to make vs rich, both in ſtock & treaſure, when we ſhall carry out a greater value of our owne goods then we bring in of forrain wares; ſo by conſequence, a courſe contrary to this, muſt of neceſſitie worke a contrary effect.
                  Neither is this importation meant otherwiſe thē concerning thoſe wares, which are conſumed in this Realm: for the cōmodities which are brought in,Forrain wares brought in for Tranſito cannot hurt, but greatly helpe the commonwealth. & after carried out vnto forren parts again, cānot hurt but doe greatly help the cōmonwealth, by encreaſe of his Maieſties Cuſtomes and Trades, with other

employments of the ſubiects; by which particulars I might yet ſet foorth the glory of the Eaſt India Trade, which hath brought into this Realme in fifteene moneths ſpace,Hopes to increaſe Trade by exportation of Indian wares to forrain parts not onely ſo much Spice, as hath ſerued the ſame for the ſayd time; but alſo by the ſuperfluitie thereof, there hath beene exported into forraine parts for about 215000. pounds ſterling. So then let all men iudge, for what a great value wee may hope hereafter to export yearely: when vnto theſe ſpices we may (by Gods aſſiſtance) add the infinite worth of Raw-ſilkes, Indicos, Callicoes, and ſome other things: All which are to bee iſſued in the nature of Cloth, Lead, Tinne, or any of our owne Merchandize to the enriching of this Kingdome by encreaſe of the Common-ſtocke. So then to conclude this poynt, we ought not to auoid the importation of forraine wares, but rather willingly to bridle our owne affections to the moderate conſuming of the ſame: for otherwiſe, howſoeuer the Eaſt India Trade in particular is an excellent meanes greatly to encreaſe the ſtocke of mony which we ſend thither yearely,The particular Trade to the Eaſt Indies wil bring great ſtore of treaſure into this Realme, if the generall Trade of this kingdome doe not hinder and conſume it by returning home fiue times the value thereof in rich commodities, all which (in ſhort time) may bee conuerted into Treaſure, as is plainly ſhewd already in Page 25. Yet notwithſtanding, if theſe Indian wares thus brought home, cannot be ſpared to ſerue for that purpoſe of Treaſure; but muſt be ſent forth together with our owne natiue commodities: and yet all little enough to prouide our exceſſe and extraordinary conſume of forraine wares: then is it likewiſe as certaine that

the generall Trade of this Kingdome doth hinder and diuert the comming in of the ſaid Treaſure, by ouer-ballancing the value of our wares exported; with the importation and immoderate conſume of forraine Commodities.
                  Therefore, foraſmuch as the number of the people in this Realme, are thought to be greatly increaſed of late time (both in themſelues and ſtrangers) whereby neceſſarily the Commodities of this Kingdome, and alſo forraine wares, are the more conſumed and waſted, a double meanes to abate the Common-wealth;) it therefore concerneth vs all in generall, and euery man in his particular, to ſtirre vp our minds, and diligence, to helpe the naturall Commodities of this Realme by induſtrie, and increaſe of Arts; ſeeing that the materials cannot bee wanting to make ſuch Stuffes, and other things as are daily brought vnto vs from forraine parts, to the great aduantage of Strangers, and to our no leſſe dammage. Neither ſhould we neglect the riches which our Seas affoord, whileſt other Nations by their labour doe procure themſelues great Treaſure from the ſame.The Dutch in particular, are ſaid to reape ſuch infinite wealth yearely by this fiſhing Trade, that without more certain knowledge thereof I dare not ſet downe the ſum, it ſeemeth ſo vncredible. And as the diligent performance of theſe things, would plentifully maintaine the poore, and much increaſe the common ſtocke of this Kingdome: ſo likewiſe for the better furtherance thereof, wee ought religiouſly to auoid our common exceſſes of food and rayment, which is growne to ſuch a height in moſt degrees of people (aboue their abilitie) that it is now beyond all example of former ages. Neither is it

needfull for me, to ſet downe the particulars of theſe abuſes; for they are too well knowne: and I am confident, that the wiſedome of our Gouernment doth endeuour to ſee them as well amended, to the glorie of God, the honour of the King, and the good of the Common-wealth. Amen.
