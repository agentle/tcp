            TO THE RIGHT
Honorable and vertuous Lady,
the Lady MARY Countesse of
Penbrooke, Health, Happinesse,
and Heauen.
            
               RIght Honorable, my
bounden Seruice in
all duety remembred,
I haue often red, and
heard, which I verelye
beeleeue, that in
the Nature of Man, there is no greater
blot of disgrace, then the vile note of
ingratitude, with which wicked humor,
fearing my long forgetfullnesse of your
fauoure, may make my heart in some
suspition vnhappily to bee touched, I
haue presumed humbly to present vnto
the faire eye of your discreete vertue a
little fruite of my late, and best labours;
VVherein your Ladyship may vouchsafe
to see, that, although I cannot as I
would finde meanes, to discharge the
care of my duty, yet in my best thoughts

I haue not forgotten you, when in my
daiely praiers vnto God, I doe remember
you: and, as I daiely and hourelye,
doe hartely pray vnto his holy Maiesty,
for his blessings to light vpon you; so
haue I set downe a few historicall prayers
for you: VVhich, I hope, you will
so finde applyed to your comfort, as shall
giue you no discontentment, in the presumption
of my paines: and so though I
haue soncke my fortune in the worlde,
hauing only the light of vertue to leade
my hope vnto Heauen, with humble
thancks for your as yet vndeserued fauour,
in continuall prayers to the God of
all comfort, for his prosperous preseruation,
of my good L. your Ladyship, & all
yours, with increase of honour on earth,
and eternall happinesse in Heauen: I
humbly take my leaue in bounden duty.
            
               Your La: sometime vnworthy Poet,
and now, and euer poore Beadman.

            TO THE LADIES
and Gentlewomen Reeders.
            
               LAdies and Gentlewomen,
so it is, that hauing
passed some partes of
the world, & beholding
the stately pallaces of
diuers princes, after my
returne into my natiue country, finding
the contemplatiue life, the most neere vnto
Angelicall nature, and no contemplatiō
so comfortable as the mercies of god,
the first fruicts whereof, and the neuer
ending Glory of the same, are no where
so apparant as in the historie of the holy
scriptures: where looking into the court
of heauen, I finde the world but a base
corner, when the King of Kinges, with
the brightnesse of his glorie doth rauish
the soules of his beeloued: and reading
in this diuine historie of the excellencie
of Gods loue, and emong many of his elected,
of some women in his especiall fauour,
I could not but acquaint your good
mindes, with the memory of their names,

& such matter touching them as you may
and will (I hope) applie to your comfort,
I finde them blessed for their faith, and
beeloued for their humility, two Iewels
of the soule, not cōmon to our humaine
nature, but as it is incorporated to christ,
but I will leaue the imperfect to Gods
amendment, the faithfull to his blessing,
and the elected to his loue: beeseeching
him so to blesse you with his grace, in
the feeling of his loue, that in praier to
his mercy, yee may all liue to his glory,
that hauing Christ for your loue, ye may
liue in ioy for euer: and so wishing you
happinesse on earth, & heauen hereafter:
I rest in praier for yee & all faithfull in
Christ Iesu: as I finde cause.

               A praier vpon the historie of Christ
his comming vnto the house of Mary
and Martha, to raise Lazerus frō
death. Iohn. 11. The fruict thereof:
The life of the dead, the glorie of God.
               
                  MOst mercifull Lord,
my louing king & euerliuing
god, sweet
Iesu Christ, my heauenly
maister, redeemer,
and Sauiour, vouchsafe mee
leaue poore and vnworthy vessell
of thy mercy, on the knees of my
soule in the humilitie of my hart,
to trouble thy patience with the
lowly petition of my afflicted spirit:
Lord whē to make knowen thy
glory to the world y• camest to Bethania,
vnto the house of Mary &
Martha, to raise vp thy beloued lazarus

frō death, what was the speech
of the poore women, thy poore
creatures vnto thy gratious & holy
Glorious maiestie? but onely
this: Lord, if thou hadst ben heere,
my brother Lazarus had not ben
dead: but now whatsoeuer thou
askest of God he will giue it thee:
so my deere Lord let mee, I besech
thee, saie vnto thee? now that by
the gratious, mercifull, & comfortable
operation of thy holy Spirit,
I feele, & see thee comming to the
vnworthie house of my wounded
soule, LORD if thou hadst beene
heere, not my brother, but my self
had not so long beene dead, dead
I say in my sinnes, though onely
liue in thy mercy: but oh Lord thy
father hath giuen all power into
thy hands, & therefore, if it please
thee, thou canst raise me from this
sorrowfull death, of iniquity, vnto
the ioyfull life of thy grace: but as

Martha saide, by hir brother Lazarus,
he had ben dead foure daies, &
therefore did so stinck that he was
vnfit to bee taken vp, so Lord, let
mee saie of my selfe, I haue beene
dead not foure daies, but many
yeeres, yea, all the daies of my life,
and therefore feele my self so vnsauory,
and vnfit to presume beefore
thy presence, that I can rather say
with Peter, come not neere mee
Lord, for I am a polluted creature,
then thincke that euer thou didst
loue mee, and therefore art come to
raise mee from this death: yet sweet
lord when I remember withall, thy
blessed aunswere, and kinde chiding
of the vnbeleeuing soule, in
these wordes: said I not vnto thee
if thou didst beleeue thou shouldst
see the glorie of God: it giueth me
comfort in my feare to come humbly
to thy mercy; beseching thee so
to strengthen my faith in thy incō
                  prehencible

power, that I may rather
reioice in feeling thy goodnes
and seeing thy glorie, then distrust
in thy power, or dispaire in thy
mercie: that by the vertue of thy
power, from the death of sinne, being
reuiued vnto grace, in the true
fruicts of repentaunce, I may glorifie
thy holy name.
               Amen.
            
            
               An other praier vpon the same historie
Chapter and place: the fruict therof:
Christ his cōmendation of the
hearers of his word.
               
                  ALmightie God and
most mercifull Lord,
my best maister and
onely sweet Sauiour
Iesus Christ, when it
pleased thee of thy mercy, to enter
into the house of Martha and Mary,
thy beloued vnworthy seruāts,
whiles Mary, by the blessed inspiration

of thy holy spirit, was happely
called, and wholy enclined to
the attentiue hearing & ioyfull receiuing
of thy comfortable preaching;
MARTHA, not so filled in
hart or rather rauished in soule
with the vnspeakable sweetnes of
thy holy spitit, rather troubling hir
head with an earnest care of worldly
busines, then bending hir hart
with any zealous desire, to the inward
seeking of thy heauenly treasure,
complained to thee of hir sisters
mistakē & mistermed idlenes,
that sitting still at thy feete she had
no more care to helpe her in hir
work, to prouide for thy welcom,
nor to attend thy presence: but,
my sweet Lord how sweetly didst
thou reproue hir folly, and reueale
hir fault in these few words: Martha
Martha thou carest, & art troubled
about many things, but one
thing is needfull, Mary hath chosen

the good part, which shal neuer be
taken awaie frō hir: oh deere Maister
now that by the secret light of
thy gratious loue, I behold thy entrance
into the hart of my soule,
though I am not worthie thou
shouldst come vnder the roofe of
my house, yet, since, it hath pleased
thy holie maiestie in the infinit
goodnesse of thy incomparable
kindnesse, to comfort my hart with
the gratious hearing of thy glorius
mercy; giue me leaue not with Martha,
to complaine of a sister, but to
accuse my selfe of to much euill in
so long combring my hart with
the wretched cares of this wicked
world, that I haue had almost no
care to humble my soule to the
happie hearing of thy holie word:
let mee therfore beeseech thee of
the abundant grace of thy glorious
goodnes, by the mighty power of
thy eternall mercy, to draw mee to

thee by the heauenly vertue of thy
hollie Spirit, that casting of all the
combersome cares of this vncomfortable
worlde, I maie not onelie
serue thee in bodie, on the knees of
my heart, worshipping thy diuine
will, but in the humilitie of my
soule, sit with MARY on the ground
with the tears of true repentaunce
to wash the feete of thy mercie:
that being both vnable & vnworthie
to behold the glory of thy presence,
I maie yet ioye in my soule
to heare the sweetnes of thy preching,
that beeing cleerely healed of
the euill part of sinne, I maie receiue
that good part of thy grace,
that maie neuer bee taken from
mee: but one thing is needfull,
and that one thing art thou: it is
thee sweet LORD that I haue need
of: needful is thy grace, & vngratious
that I am, full of need am I of
thy mercie: mercy my sweet Iesu,

Oh let my pensiue hart heere the
preaching of thy mercie, that beeing
with LAZARVS reuiued, and
with MARTHA rebuked, with Mary
I may bee so comforted, that with
the teares of my hart washing the
feete of thy pittie, I may reioice in
my soule to bee admitted into thy
presence; wherein the obedience
of my Loue, shewing the Ioye
of my life, I may feede of thy mercy
and singe to thy glory: Blessed
is the house that dooth receiue
thee, happy the hart, that dooth
attend thee, but most ioyfull the
Soule, that leauing the cares of
the world hath all hir comfort
but in thee: in thee I say sweet
LORD, the lyght of the eternall
wisdome, the lyfe of the dead,
& the only comfort of the liuing;
whose preaching most gratious,
and whose presence most glorious,
happye are they that heare,

but most blessed that enioy: emong
whome, alas, of the world
most vnworthy, so blesse the sicke
Soule of thy sinfull wounded seruant,
that ouercome with the comfort
of thy vnspeakable kindenes,
in the swounding traunce of the
treasure of thy Loue, I may rather
dye at thy feete, then part a foote
from thy fauoure: where with the
teares of faithes thanckfulnesse, I
may encrease the Glorie of thy
Mercie.
               Amen.

chapter and place, the fruite therof:
The blessing of humilitie.
               
                  REmember sweet Lord
Iesu thy Mercies that
haue been euer of old,
forgiue and forget the
sinnes of thy humble repentaunt,
though vnworthie seruants, think
on thy poore Mary with the teares

of hir heart humbling hir soule at
thy feete, thincke I saye my sweet
lord, a little vpon my great misery,
that confesse my selfe vnworthie
of the least looke of thy Mercie:
Lord, it pleased thee to saie, Marie
Magdaline loued much, but surelie
thou louedst more, that so great
and vnmeasurable a sinner, woldst
vouchsafe so great a measure of
thy Grace, beeing vnworthie, thy
thought, to presume into thy presence:
sweet IESVS, art not thou
the same CHRIST? who camest
not to iustifie the righteous, but
to call sinners to repentaunce? is
thy mercie anye thing diminished,
or shall not thy Glorie euer
encrease? it cannot bee, but thou
art thy selfe, the Sunne of GOD,
the Redeemer of the worlde, the
Lambe of God, that takest away
the sinnes of the world, and God
alone, that hast the gouernement

of the whole worlde: what thou
hast bought then, who can take
from thee? wher thou hast Mercie,
who canne diswade thee? and hauing
all thinges vnder thy feete,
who can resist thee? Thou Createdst
man for thy selfe, thou Redeemedst
him by thy selfe, & dost
comfort him, but with thy selfe;
wilt thou then forget the worke of
thine owne hands? wilt thou loose
that thou hast bought with thine
owne blood? or suffer it to be blasted
that y• hast blessed with thine
owne Spirit? no, sweet God, thy
goodnesse is to great to loose any
parte of thy Glorie: though wee
forget thy loue, thou canst not forget
thy Mercie, though wee loose
our selues in this wildernesse, thou
wilt bring vs home to thy folde, &
though sinne seeke to driue vs to
despaire, yet doth thy Grace assure
vs of comfort; for thou art kinde,

though wee are vnthanckfull, thou
art mercifull, though wee are vnfaithful,
yea thou art comfortable,
when wee are most miserable: and
why is all this? beecause thou art
God, whose goodnesse hath no limit,
whose mercies are infinit, and
whose glorie shall haue no ende:
why then oh Lord is my Soule so
full of heauinesse, and my heart so
disquieted within mee? can the
world so werie mee, that Heauen
cannot reuiue mee? or can sinne
so infect mee, that thy mercie can
not heale mee? or the diuell so terifie
mee, that thou my God canst
not comfort mee? no, my deere
god, thou art able to forgiue more
then I am able to offend, one drop
of thy mercie, will heale all the
woundes of my sinne, and where
thou entrest with thy holly spirit,
there is no place for the wicked
fiende: what then can hurt mee if

thou help mee? can sinne set a wal
beetwixt thy mercie and my comfort:
whē thou hast troden downe
the diuell, with all the power of
his malice, can death afright mee
that see my life in thy loue? or can
sorrow dismaie mee that haue
thee for my comfort? no, my sweet
sauioure, let not my teares be onely
witnesse of my sorrow for my
sinnes, but of my ioie in thy mercie,
that from the greatnesse of sin,
hast called mee to thy grace, and liuing
long from the shadow of thy
blessing, hast admitted mee into
the Ioie of thy presence: Oh blessed
Lord how admirable dooe I
feele thy goodnesse in the inward
works of thy grace? faith a fruict of
thy mercy, repentaunce a fruict of
faith, teares a fruict of repentance,
Ioie a fruict of teares, & thou only
the fruict of all; thou art oh Lord ye
summe of all sweetnesse, the substaunce

of all goodnesse, & in thy
selfe to thy selfe the only height of
all glorie: Thou art the ioie of the
heart, the comfort of the minde, &
the life of the soule: Thou art the
portion of mine inheritance, the
longing of my hearts loue, and the
onely heauen that I hope for: who
can know thee and not loue thee?
or know what loue is, & is not rauished
with the thought of thee?
O my sweet Sauiour, since it hath
pleased thee to call mee vnto thee,
I humbly beeseech thee, let mee
neuer goe from thee, but let mee
liue and die with thee, that I maie
die to liue with thee: for yu onely
art the life, & the onely life of thē
that come vnto thee: and to thee
onely doe I come with sorowfull
MARY beeseeching thy comfort, in
the greatnesse of thy goodnesse, so
to inspire my hart with the grace of
thy holie spirit, that with ye teares

of my soul mingled with one drop
of thy pretious blood, I maie wash
awaie the filth of my vnsauerie
sinne, and in the comfort of thy
kindenesse, I may kisse the feete of
thy mercie, till out of the wretched
vale of this worldly miserie,
thou wilt bring mee to the
ioies of the elected in thy loue,
that there beeing preserued, by
the hande of thy mercie, with
the Angells of thy traine I maie
sing to thy Glorie.
               Amen.
            
            
               A prayer vppon Elizabethes meeting
with hir cosen Mary the blessed virgin:
Luke i. Chap. 4. i. verse: The fruict
therof: The ioies of the elected that by
the loue of grace are allied vnto Christ.
               
                  YF all the treasures of the
world were layde together,
were they any better
then trash, compared
(oh LORD) to the least thought of

thy Loue? are not the Heauens
them selues the workes of thy singers?
and is not the earth with all
hir glory, most glorious in beeing
thy footestoole? what thē are wee
but drossie creatures of slimy clay?
but wherin thou hast made vs gratious,
to encrease the greatnesse of
thy glory: shall we then attribute
vnto our selues that is due only vnto
thee? or thinck our selues to bee
any thing, that haue our being but
in thee? wilful were such a blindenesse,
and wofull were such a sight,
as taking night for the day, would
seeke paradise in hell: LORD keepe
vs from such a folly, cleere vs from
such a blindenesse, & saue vs from
falling into such an errour: be thou
the light of our loue, the sence of
our vnderstanding, the wisedome
of our knowledge, the meditation
of our hearts, and the ioy of our
Soules: but sweet LORD, I reede

that when ELIZABETH met with
hir cosen MARY the blessed Virgin
thy blessed mother, the babe sprāg
in hir wombe, which after he came
into the world, did preach of thy
kingdome aboue the world: and
now mee thincks, I feele thy holy
Spirit making entraunce into my
Soule, there rise vp thoughts in my
heart to honour thee in the highest
Heauens; but the thought is
yet yong, & cannot prosper without
thy blessing, it is conceiued in
my Soule by the blessing of thy
grace, LORD preserue it with thy
mercy, that I may bring ir foorth
to thy glorie: though when it is at
the best, as it is frō me it is vnworthy
to loose the least latchet of thy
shoe, yet as it is from thee a guift
of thy Goodnesse, at the Feete
of thy mercie, let it speake of thy
glorie: thy grace hath begot it, let
thy good spirit breed it, & thy holy

hande so preserue it, y• being fed in
this infancy with the sweet milk of
thy Mercy, it mai gather such force,
in the faith of thy holy word, yt delighting
in thy law, & liuing but in
thy Loue, it may loath the whole
world to be ye lest in thy kingdom:
oh sweet Lord let my hart reioyce
to heere of thee, my sences to serue
thee, & my soule to praise thee, bee
thou ye childe of my loue, the Lord
of my life, & the life of my soul, let
my soule euer conceiue thee & neuer
part frō thee: yt hauing thee for
my comfort, I may feare no crosse,
nor care for any calamity, be yu swet
Iesu my father, & my child, my husband,
& my brother, my loue my
life, my Lord & my god; in whom
my spirit may reioyce when I but
thinck of thy blessing: that beeing
wholy rauished with the vertue of
thy loue, in harmony of thy graces,
I may Glorify thy holly name.
               Amen.
            
            
               
               A praier vpon the talke of Christ with
the woman of Samaria. Ihon. 4. The
fruict therof: the comfort of mercy.
               
                  PEereles loue, and purest
life of thy beloued, pardon
I beeseech thee the
presūption of thy poore
wounded creature, wounded with
sinne, and cureles of hir sore, but
onely in the merite of thy MERCY,
in the oile of thy grace, & wounds
of thy loue: oh sweet IESV, thou
didst vouchsafe at Iacobs well of
the woman of Samaria, to aske a
little water; thou talkedst with hir,
& reueledst thy selfe vnto hir, who
vnworthy of thy comfort could
not conceiue the greatnes of thy
kindenes: but alas Lord, heere is
another woman that commeth
with another thirst, & to drinck of
another fountaine: which fountaine

onely art thou alone, thou art
the well of life, of which who
drinketh shall neuer dye: long hath
my soule thirsted after thee, yea in
a barraine and drie land where no
water is: oh that I might, so drinck
of thy vertue, that beeing dronck
with thy loue, I might bee so moistened
with thy grace, that I might
neuer thurst more after sinne: oh
sweet Iesu how sweet is thy sweetnes,
no hart can Imagine nor tung
can expresse; a fountaine neuer dri,
of the abūdance of whose streams
all the blessed come to drincke, all
that drinck are in loue, and all that
loue doe liue for euer: such a spring
neuer drying, such a loue euer liueing,
& such a life euer ioying, wher
is it but in thee? & where art thou
but it is? oh foūtaine of all blessednes,
oh blessing of all happines, oh
felicity of all ioyfulnes, quench the
fire of my thirst with one droppe

of thy grace, let fall the dew of thy
blessing vpon the drie hart of my
soule; that being refreshed with thy
loue, I maie deuote my life to thy
seruice: for, sweet LORD, though
the woman of Samaria would not
offer thee drinck, beecause the Samaritans
would not meddle with
the iewes, yet sweet Lord I am sure
thou wilt not denie me thy mercy,
because I am a sinner: for thou hast
mercy in store for all them that
come vnto thee, Iacob their father
gaue yt well as it seemed, to an vncourteous
people, that would not
giue thee a cuppe of their water:
but God thy father hath giuen
thee to all people a fountaine of
life to all that in true faith thirst to
drinck of thy loue: & how incomparable
is thy kindnes, that with
the blood of thy hart didst seale
the bond of thy loue: doest thou
denie any one comfort, that callest

all vnto thy mercy: or doest thou
suffer any to perish that put their
trust in thy word? doest thou not
offer thy selfe freely? & shall I not
beg thee with teares? yes sweet
Lord I humbly thanck thee, I feele
the sweetnes of thy loue, though
I can not beeholde thy presence, I
tast of thy goodnes though I see
not thy persō, & drinck of thy vertue
though I know not thine essence;
for had not the medicine of
thy mercy cured my soul of hir sorow,
I had died in my sinne, ere I
had tasted of thy grace, but sweet-LORD,
the woman of Samaria had
many husbands, & my soule desireth
but thy loue, be thou I say the
husband, of my loue, the loue of
my life, and life of my soule, the
fountaine of my faithes comfort,
the water of my hopes life, & the
sweet of my eternall felicitie: let
me thirst only for thy grace, drinck

onely of thy mercie, & liue onely
to thy Glorie: that from the puddles
of the worlde, deliuered by
thy mercy, in the ioies of paradise,
I may sing Halaluiah to thy holly
Maiestie:
               Amen.

the distressed, that in true faith of
thy woord, fly to the mercy of thy
will; emong those miserable sinners,
that haue no hope of reliefe,
but in the heauenly eye of thy
mercy, vouchsafe sweet Christ, to
cast one looke of pitty vppon the
wounded heart of my vnworthy
soule; whē the woman of syrophenissa
came to thee, for the cure of
hir daughter, possessed with a diuel,
though at the first, thou gauest
hir a kinde of denying answere, in
that it was not meete to giue the
Childrens meate vnto dogges, yet
to hir humble replie, that the dogs
might eate of the crummes that
fall from their masters table, to the
glory of thy mercy thou madest a
gratious Conclusion; wherein the

humility of hir faith, had effected
hir ioy in thy fauour: hir daughter
was made whole, and shee departed
away: but now oh Lord
was she onely blessed in this abundant
measure of thy mercy? or can
sin haue such power in the world,
as to bar thy seruants thy blessing?
or shal any dispaire of thy comfort,
when thou callest all vnto mercy?
no, sweet Lord, I know thou art
not partial in thy loue, that lookest
onely into thy selfe, thou art not
sparing of thy blessing, that art boū
                  tifull
to the whole world, nor
wouldest the death of a sinner, &
therfore wilt surely haue mecry on
thy seruants: to thee therefore
sweet Iesu I humbly come, not for
my diseased daughter, but thy distressed
daughter, vnworthy of so
good a father, yet praying thee,
good father help me, & thi vnworthy
seruant, beseeching thee sweet

maister comfort mee, and thy vnworthy
creature, crying vnto thee
oh God of all mercy haue mercy
vpon mee, in the multitude of thy
compassions do away all my offences,
in the oyle of the grace heale
my soule of hir sinne, & in the power
of thy mercy deliuer me from
euill, I know not with how many
diuells I am daily & hourely tempted,
by a world of illusions, to bee
drawen from thy loue, but, were
ther neuer so many, thou canst deliuer
me from them all; for, thy power
is inuincible, thy mercy is Almightie,
and thy loue hath no limits;
sinne is but an infection, the
diuells are but ministers of thy
wrath, & thou wilt haue mercy on
thy seruants; heale therefore my disease,
commaund away my tormentors,
and bee glorious in thy goodnesse:
where thy good spirit entereth,
no euill spirit will bide, where

thy grace toucheth, no sinne tarrieth,
and whom thou inspirest with
thy loue, they are allready in heauen:
but alas sweet IESVS mee
thincks I heere thee accuse mee of
so dogged a nature, that I am not
worthy to feede of the fruict of thy
fauour, Lord I cōfesse it that while
dogs waite one their masters trenchers,
I haue not attended on the
table of thy merry; & therfore am
vnworthy of the least crum of thy
comforte: yet sweet Lord, since
thy mercy is ouer all thy workes,
put mee not out of the booke of
thy remembraunce: thou hast called
mee though I come late, giue
mee a penny of thy charity though
I deseure nothing of thy mercy:
I am sick, & thou canst heale mee,
bee thou gratious though I be sinfull,
the diuell is a tirant, but thou
art ye god of mercy, who with one
looke of thine eie canst make him

flye from thy presence, with one
woord of thy mouth canst banish
hi
                     •
                   from thy beloued, & with one
blessing of thy hand canst make me
liue euer: but, oh sweet LORD since
I haue by

glorie is 
                     •
                  n thy mercy, loose no part
of thy right: let me come behinde
thee emong thē throng, of sinners,
to touch the hem of thy garment,
that by the vertue of my faith, I
maie finde grace in thy fauour, &
being cured of my sinne, & comforted
by thy mercy by the grace
of thy holly spirite, I may Glorifiy
thy holly name: & not with the Siroph

till being wholely deliuered,
from the temptation of sin, in the
saluation of thy mercy, with the

               A prayer vpon the widdowes two Mites:
xii. of Marke 41 verse. The
fruict thereof the praise of Charity.
               
                  NOthing is more comfortable
to my soule then
the Meditation of thy
mercy, sweet Iesu, thou
alone art hee whom my soule loueth,
and iust cause, for by thy onely
loue, my soule liueth: when I beholde
thee in my hart, I haue enough
for my comfort, & wanting
thy grace, I comsume away with
calamitie: oh vnspeakable sorrow,
to misse the ioy of thy mercy, and
how great is their heauen, that
haue a feeling of thy loue, oh sweet

Lord, how greatly wilt thou commend
a little loue in thy seruant?
but how infinitly art thou to bee
glorified, that giuest thy selfe vnto
sinners: oh imcōparable kinde loue
to lay downe the life of thy beeloued:
thou didst commend the
poore widdow, for casting two mites
into the treasury, & thou hast
giuen vs thy selfe to bring vs into
thy treasury: bee thou therefore
commended aboue all commendation:
shee gaue but a little,
though all shee had; yu gauest thy
selfe, without whom all things are
nothing; let hir then bee commended
of thee, who sawest hir hart, &
for thy bounty to the whol world,
be thou glorified aboue the world:
shee was called a poore widdow,
beecause shee wanted both the
wealth of the world and the comfort
of hir kind husband, but how
much might shee bee comforted,

to be cōmended by thy mercy? all
comforts faile wher thou art wanting,
and all ioies abound wher thy
comfott is comming: O comfort
of comforts, when wilt thou come
vnto mee? LORD, thou art the husband
of my soule, the onely comfort
of my hart, & whole substance
of my felicity: a poore widow am
I, that wanting the comfort of thy
loue, haue no ioy in my life: I haue
not a mite to present vnto thy
mercy: had I a whole world, I
would giue it for thy grace: but, alas,
I am poore, and hast thou any
nede of welth? that hast the whole
world at commaundement: doest
thou care for drosse, that art the
LORD of heuen & earth? no, LORD,
thou wantest nothing, & therefore
what though I haue nothing? thou
hast giuen mee thy selfe, and can
any thing take thee from mee? no
sweet LORD, thou hast saide thou

wilt haue mercy, & not Sacrifice:
a burnt offering I know thou
wouldest not accept, if I should
giue it thee: but, if any Sacrifice
will please thee, a contrite hart, and
a troubled spirit is that which thou
wilt not despise: with this sacrifice
therefore sweet Iesu I come to
thee, beseeching thee, into the treasury
of thy mercy, with the teares
of my hart, to receiue me body &
soule, which though lesse worth
then one mite is all that I haue to
giue thee: and well is mee, if thou
wilt take them, to cure them of sin,
to ease them of sorrow, & to bring
them to ioie: but alas, I giue thee
but thine owne, which thou hast
bought with thy selfe, & therefore
I beeseech thee refuse not thine
owne, that belongeth to none but
thy sel
                     •
                  e, & therefore since I haue
nothing to giue thee, take thine
owne vnto thee, commend whom

it pleaseth thee, and be thou commended
of all: of all I say, for all &
aboue all, since that for all in all,
thou deseruest all commendation;
to thee sweet Iesus Christ the husband
of my soule, the substance of
my wealth, the ioy of my life, and
assured hope of my saluation, that
by the bitter death of thy body, &
precious bloud of thy hart, hast
deerely bought the loue of thy seruants,
who by thy onely merit being
redeemed from hell, by the sauing
faith of thy mercy, are assured
of heauen, to thee I saie, deere
CHRIST, my deere loue, my best
husband, my heauenly father my
gratious LORD & onely glorious
King, with thy heauenly father &
thy holy spirit, he eternal trinity in
vnity, one onely almighrie and incomprehensible
good god, for the
infinit comforts of thy infinit mercies,
bee all infinit glory, honor, &

Praise world without end.
               Amen.
            
            
               A prayer vpon the request that the
mother of Iames & Iohn, made vnto
Chrïst: Math: Chap: 20▪ The
fruict thereof: Knowledge what to
aske of God.
               
                  BLessed LORD, and Lord
of all blessing, bountiful
GOD, and GOD of all
bounty, King of heauen
and earth, to whom all the worlde
are but beggers; emong the infinit
number of thy incessaunt sutors,
y• neuer leaue to importunate thy
mercy, vouchsafe sweet IESV I beseech
thee, to heere an humble petition
of thy poore wretched and
vnworthy creature; The Mother
of Iames, and Iohn, made a suite
vnto thee for hir two sonnes, that
the one might sit at thy right hand,
and the other at thy left: little was

hir discretiō to moue so presumptuous
a petition, little I say shee
considered thy greatnesse, or lookt
into hir owne smalnesse, that, deseruing
nothing but thy Wrath,
woulde craue such a blessing of
thy Grace: who beeing aunswered
with deniall, escaped wel without
thy further displeasure: oh my
GOD, I come not to thee with a
spirit of such boldnesse; but in the
humility of fayth, with the teares
of sorrow, my wounded hart, beecommeth
a sutor to thy mercy; an
humble sutor I am oh heauenly
King to thy holy Maiesty, not for
my two sonnes, but the two parts
of my selfe, my soule, & my body,
y• it will please thy gratious goodnesse,
so farre to take them to thy
mercy, as not to set them either at
thy right hand, or thy left, but in
one looke of thy comfort, to make
thē but cushins for thy feet: where

more ioyfull shall bee my teares,
to wash, the feete of thy fauoure,
then all the plesures of the world,
to bee away from thy mercy: this,
oh LORD, is all my sute, which in
thy gratious pitty I beeseech thee
to graunt me, that from this vale of
misery, thou wilt take mee to thy
mercy, that in the ioye of thy loue,
I may euer sing or thy glory:
               Amen.
            
            
               A prayer vpon the deuotion of Anna,
Luke 2. Chap. The fruict thereof:
The comfort of prayer.
               
                  RIghteous LORD, holy
KING, and euerliuing
GOD, who hast not to
doe with the stoole of
iniquitie, but, with thy Countenaunce
doest beehold the iust, forgiuest
the sinnes of the Repentaunt,
and takest the faithfull vnto
mercy. Enter not, I beeseech thee

into iudgement with thy sinfull
and vnworthy seruant; for, no flesh
is righteous in thy sight: & I most
vnrighteous, am ashamed to appeere
beefore thy presence, with
hope of comfort, or almost without
despaire of mercy, but y• in the
greatnesse or thy goodnesse, seeing
thee offer thy selfe vnto mee with
all thy Graces, with a blushing
feare, I fall at the feete of thy mercy,
beeseeching thee, so to blesse
mee with thy grace, that my wickednes
may not destroy, that which
thy goodnesse hath builded: Oh
deere LORD, thy seruaunt ANNA,
putting of the world and putting
on thee, shaking of all vanities, and
clothing hir self with thy comfort,
leauing the world, beetooke hir
selfe to thy Temple, where continuing
manye yeeres in fasting
and praier, shee receiued at last the
ioyefull fruict of hir hope, in the

gratious beeholding of thy Glorious
comming: but, oh Lord, wo
is me, that haue so long looked after
the world, that I haue so little
looked after thee, that I haue rather
lost my selfe in a wildernesse,
then once set a steppe into thy
Temple: I haue feasted my flesh
with the pleasures of the world,
& almost famished my soule with
the lack of thy holy word, & haue
beene rather lost many yeeres in
vanity, then employed almost any
houre in deuout prayer, as one rather
fearing thy wrath, then wishing
thy presence: but, sweet Lord,
thou art the God of Eternity, who
hauing all time at thy commaundement,
dost appoynt euery houre
at thy plesure, to call thy seruants,
vnto mercy, and to comfort them
in thy blessing; to thee therefore
my deere Lord, though long first,
yet at last, & I hope neuer to late,

on the knees of my heart with the
tears of my loue I come vnto thy
mercy, beseeching thee most humbly,
in the spirit of thy grace, so to
instruct mee to pray, and continue
mee in praier vnto the presence of
thy pitty, that putting of the delights
of the vanitie of this world,
I may put on the ioy of the vertue
of thy loue, beetaking my selfe to
the Temple of thy Truth, and
only long in my soule to beehold
the blessing of thy cōming: come
I say, sweet Iesu, come downe into
my heart, heale my wounded
soule, quiet my troubled spirit, deliuer
mee from this sinfull prison,
lighten my darckned eies, take me
out of this deadly sorrow into the
ioy of thy eternall mercy, where
feeding on the fruict of my faith in
the fauour of thy grace, at the feet
of thy presence, I may see the paradise
of my soule: & in a new song

of thanckes giuing, I may glorify
thy holy name:
               Amen.
            
            
               A prayer vpon the queene of sheba hir
comming to Solomon: The fruict
thereof: The treasure of true wisedome
which is onely in the word of
GOD.
               
                  O Infinitte and eternall
God, the ground of all
vertue, and giuer of all
goodnesse, the fountayn
of vnsearchable deepe wisedome
of the incomprehensyble Deity;
looke, I humblye beeseech thee
vpon the simple soule of thy silly
creature: The Queene of Sheba
came to thy seruaunt Solomon, to
heere the wōder of his wit, which
compared to thy wisedome, is as
nothing, and shall not I come to
thee for the knowledge of my cō
                  sort?
yes my deere LORD, let thy

mercy be my tutor, thy wisdome,
my lesson, thy comfort, my lyfe:
Teach me euer how to pray, what
to hope for in my prayer, and how
to bee thanckfull or thy blessings:
teach me wisdome to know thee,
knowledge to serue thee, & Grace
so to loue thee, that I may neuer
liue to leaue thee: bee thou the cō
                  templatiō
of my study, the letters
of my reading, & the woord of my
continuall remembrance; the note
of my Comfort the white of my
loue, and 
                     •
                  he light of my lyfe: Inspire
my hart with thy holy spirit,
leade mee in the way of thy truth,
and blesse mee with the ioy of thy
peace: that leauing this desart,
where fooles loose their wittes, emong
the followers of thy will, I
may heere the wonders of thy wisdome:
where the saith of the s
                     •
                  mple,
finde the summe of their felycity:
that beeing pardoned my

faults, & healed of my folly, in the
seruice of my faith I mai glorify thy
holy Maiestie: but oh Lord shee
brought gifts of great value, which
she presented vnto thy seruaunt, &
I haue nothing to giue thee but
my selfe, vnworthy present for thy
presence: but sweet Lord, I beeseech
thee refuse not thy seruant,
though vnworthy thy fauour, and
instruct me in thy law, though vnworthy
thy loue, that hauing thy
lesson in my heart, I may teach thy
wil vnto the world: graunt this oh
deere God, for thy deere beloued
Sonne IESVS CHRIST his onely
sake, to whome with thee, and the
holy Ghost, three persons, but
one GOD, bee all Honour, and
Glory, humbly ascribed of mee,
and all thy poore vnworthy seruants,
in all things, for all things,
and aboue all things, world without
ende:

               A praier vpon the words of Peter vnto
Christ in the time of his transfiguration.
Luke ix. verse 33. The
fruict therof: the ioy of the faithfull.
               
                  O How amiable are thy
dwellings my deer Lord
Iesu, how pleasant are
thy graces? & how comfortable
are thy mercies? more
sweet are they to my hart, then
hony vnto my mouth, yea sweeter
then hony and the hony combe:
when thy holy Apostle Peter beeheld
thee transfigured, beeing rauished
in soule with the sweet
of thy countenance, then could he
say, heere is good beeing LORD:
so my sweet sauiour, when in my
soule I behold but one beame of
thy bright loue, I can say to my self,
it is good being with thee LORD:

for better is it, not to be at all, then
to be without the comfort of thy
blessing: blesse mee therfore sweet
IESV, I beeseech thee with the feeling
of thy goodnes, the comfort
of thy mercy, & the ioy of thi loue:
and let mee saie, to my selfe, whiles
I am in this body of sinne, in this
wretched world, heere is ill being
LORD, wher I am so much without
thee, and, onely their is good beeing
where I might neuer bee from
thee, that being rauished with the
sweetnes of thy brightnes, I might
make my poore soule, a tabernacle
for thy dwelling, that beeing clensed
from my sinne, by the onely
merite of thy mercy, & sweeted in
my soule, by the oile of thy grace,
in the fruicts, of thancks giueing,
I may Glorifye thy
holly name:
               Amen.
            
            
               
               A praier vpon Mary Magdalens weeping
at the Sepulcher: Iohn xvi:
The fruict thereof: the vertue
of constancy, in the loue of the faithfull.
               
                  KNock saiest thou sweet
Iesus, & it shall bee opened
vnto vs, seeke & we
shall finde, aske & wee
shall haue: oh my deer God long
haue I sought thee, with the zealous
loue of my hart, knocking at
the gates of thy grace, with the
sighes of vnfained sorrow, & beging
with bitter tears, but one drop
of thy mercy: but my deere God
sinne did so blind mee, that I went
still out of the way, that doth lead
mee to thy will, sin did so oppresse
me, I could not come at thy grace;
yea, sinne did so dismaie mee, that
I was afraide of thy mercy: but

now sweet Lord being cleered of
my blindnes, by the light of thy
holy word, and seeing the gates of
thy grace open to the passage of
the Repentaunt emong the hopes
of the faithfull, I beg an almes of
thy mecry: I reed oh Lord of Mary
Magdalens great grace, who being
a great sinner yet by a great repentance,
receiued a great measure
of thy mercy: in sorrow she sought
thee, in humility she loued thee, &
in loue shee found thee: yea, aliue
shee loued thee, dead, shee mourned
for thee, buried she sought thee:
and risen she found thee: sweetly
was shee blessed, that hauing once
beegon to seeke thee could neuer
leaue till she found thee, & hauing
once found thee, did so deerely
loue thee that in the depth of hir
loue, shee had no ioie to liue from
thee: sweet Iesu, so giue me grace
to seeke thee, that in thy grace, I

may finde thee, by thy grace I may
loue thee, &, in thy gratious loue, I
may liue to beehold thee: open
mine eares, that I may heare thee
call: and open mine eies, that I may
see thy goodnesse: open my hart,
that I may with teares attend thee,
and open thy handes, to take mee
wholy vnto thee: mortify my flesh,
that my soule may liue, shut me not
from the gates of thy grace, but
keep mee vnder the shadow of thy
wings: lead mee through the darknes
of sinne, into the day light of
thy loue; the first day in the weeke
and earely in the morning let mee
seeke thee, let the prime of my
youth and the whole time of my
pilgrimage, bee onely emploied to
the finding out of thy fauour: let
mee feare nothing while thou art
my hope, nor bee satisfied with any
thing till I be filled with thy loue:
let mee weepe at thy graue, that I

may ioy in thy grace; & so mourne
for thy absence, that I may reioice
in thy presence: let mee not depart
with thy disciples, but abide with
thine angells, till, in the pitie of my
sorrow, thou wilt shew me thy self:
when, hearing from thee, but Mary,
I may aunswere, but master, wherin
my soule rauished with thy loue
may deuote the seruice of my life:
but, oh Lord, how should I most
wofull, wretched, & wicked creature,
liueing in this vale of sorrow
& misery, come to the comfortable
hope to clime the hil of thi mercy?
a polluted vessell of the earth, to
behold the pure and bright Glory
of the heauens? but oh LORD, doe
I aske thee how? & haue thy holy
word so cleere a lanthorne to my
loue; forgiue my sweet Christ, my
forgetfulnes of thy care, and giue
me grace to remember the rules of
my comfort: wherein I finde after

storms faire weather is sweetest, after
troubles, peace is most comfortable,
& after death, life is most ioy
full; sweet Iesu therefore that hast
mortified mee with the stormes of
this world, comfort mee with the
Sunne shine of thy Grace, after
the troublesome temptations, of euill
spirits, giue mee peace in thy
holy spirit, and after the death of
this my carnall Absence, giue my
soule life in the beeholding of thy
presence: giue mee patience to
seeke thee in thy passion, that I
may reioyce to see thy Resurrection:
and that in the Merit of thy
mercy, receiuing the Comfort of
my saluation, I may with the tears
of my hart witnesse the loue of
my soule, not desiring to
liue, but to Glorify
thy holy name:
               Amen.

The ioy of the soule that is rauished
with the loue of CHRIST.
               
                  ESscence of eternity, in ye
holy Maiesty of the Trinall
vnity, in the heauenly
DEITY, light of the
Heauens, day of the world, beawty
of vertue, & Glory of wisdome,
sweet IESV, the true and only beegotten
and beeloued sonne, of the
true, and only incomprehensible,
euerliuing, and euerlouing GOD:
my Creator in thy power, my Redeemer
in thy merite, my Sanctifier
in thy loue, and my Sauiour in
thy mercy; how shall I, clodde of
claye, slime of the earth, dust and
Ashes, wretched worme, & wicked
creature, presume to the happinesse,
to haue a thought of such

holinesse, as to aspire, so high a
blessing, as to touch the smallest
tittle, of the due title of thy glory:
yet, sweet IESV, seeing that ye dead
Earth in hir Fruictes dooth praise
thee, shall my soule liue, and in no
seruice honor thee? and since the
liuing doe adore thee, shall I dye,
and not praise thee? God forbid:
but, alas, shall darcknesse speake of
light, Error of truth, basenesse of
Glory, or a sinner, of God? when
the Earth quakes, the Sea Roares,
the Heauens shake, and the Aungells
tremble at thy presence, and
yet I see the Elements giue theyr
natures: The Sunne his heate, the
water hir coolenesse, the Aire hir
moisture, and the Earth hir drinesse;
The trees theyr fruicts, the
flowers their sweets, the Sea
hir fishes, the Earth hir gemmes,
the Ayre hir comfort, the Fyre hir
light, & the world hir welth in the

seruice of hir Creatures in obedience
to thy holy will, to Glorify
thy holy name; and shall I of all
the world most bound to thee in
the whole world, that haue tasted
so much of thy goodnesse, so much
forget thy Greatnesse, as, in no
work of thy Grace, to humble my
soule to thy Glory? God forbid:
no, my sweet God, I humbly beeseech
thee giue mee the patience
of thy saincts, the faith of thy Martiers,
the ioy of thine Angells, and
the wisedome of thy holy Spirit,
that I may suffer all things for thy
loue, I may die in thy seruice, and
so sing of thy goodnesse, that in
ringing out thy praises, the heuens
may reioyce to heere thy glory in
the world: oh my sweet CHRIST,
help mee to honour thee: Inspire
my heart with thy Loue, tell mee
what to thincke of thee, teach mee
what I shall say of thee, learne mee

how I shall praie vnto thee; that in
my Soule, I may neuer cease to
prayse thee: O glory in the highest
heauens, highest glory of the
heauens, onely glory beefore the
heauens, bee thou glorified aboue
the heuens: oh that my hrat could
dissolue into teares, to wash the
feete of thy fauour, or that my
soule in sighes, could ascend a Sacrifice
to thy mercy, that in Soule
and body, I might shew some seruice
of my loue, which am worse
then nothing, till I bee something
in thee: but thou hast made mee,
as it hath pleased thee, and canst
make mee what it pleaseth thee,
let it therefore please thee, I beeseech
thee, to make mee onely to
please thee: I am a creature of thy
will, worke mee onely to thy will:
draw mee to thee, by thy holy spirit,
hold mee to thee, by thy holy
Loue, and inspire mee with thy

holy wisedome, that loathing the
worlde with the vanities thereof,
in thy onely mercy, I may see the
paradise of my soule: that hauing
with patience passed my purgatory
in this life, & in the merit of thy
mercy, receiuing the comfort of
my Saluation, where the Angells
of thy loue, doe sing in Glory of
thy grace, my poore humble
Soule may sing Amen
to their Musique.
               Gloria in excelcis Deo.
