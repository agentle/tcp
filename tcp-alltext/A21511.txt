               don or other his Maieſties Myntes, to the intent the ſame might be exchaunged into Shillynges, Grotes or other kynde of monoyes: It hath ſo chaunſed that by reaſon aſwel of the multitude of that coyne heretofore made in the tyme of theſayd late kyng his Maieſties father, as alſo by the great quantitie and foyſon of the ſame coyne, counterfaited and brought into this realme, beyng currant, here, all theſayd Teſtons hath not be chaunged. And thervpon his highnes by thaduiſe aforeſayd was pleaſed that theſayd Proclamacion ſhould be enlarged vnto a lenger day, and ſo hath permitted and ſuffred theſayd coyne of Teſtons to be currant amonges his ſubiectes vntill the firſt of May laſt paſt, vpon truſt that in that ſpace vpon the cōſideracions in theſayd Proclamacion expreſſed, euery man for his part helping that waies, all maner of theſayd Teſtons of the ſtamp of theſayd late kyng of famous memory ſhould haue been brought into the Myntes and exchaūged. In the whiche ſpace yet many abuſyng his highnes clemencie hath kept their Teſtons ſtil in their hā
               des, or otherwiſe vttered them, & fewer ſithens that tyme til now of late haue been brought into his highnes Myntes. The whiche Teſtons if they ſhould now remayne only mere bullion, ſhould be great loſſe and hynderaūce to his Maieſties ſubiectes: And if the ſame ſtay or Proclamacion ſhould in any wiſe be releaſed, it ſhould be greateſt loſſe & hynderaunce to the realme, and a preſent occaſion of cōtinual bringyng in more coūterfait Teſtons: Therfore the kynges Maieſtie by thaduiſe of the lorde Protector and the reſt of his highnes coūſail, ſtraightly chargeth and commaundeth theſayd Proclamacion of diſanullyng & criyng doune of theſayd Teſtons to be kept emonges al his louyng ſubiectes ſo that the ſame be neuer hereafter taken for currant or lawful money, but may lawfully be refuſed of any maner of perſon: And yet neuertheles of his moſte princely clemencie & liberalitie, his highnes by thaduiſe aforeſayd is content that all ſuche ſummes of money as ſhalbe due to his Maieſtie, aſwell for the Relief graunted in the laſt ſeſſions of the Parliament, as for all other rentes and debtes may be payed in good & lawful Teſtons of the ſtamp and coyne of his Maieſties father at any tyme before the firſt of Iune next folowyng, and ſo receiued of his highnes Threaſurers vntill the ſayd firſt of Iune next folowyng onely, after the rate and value of xii. d. euery Teſton. After whiche tyme his highnes pleaſure is, that in no wiſe theſayd Teſtons be any more receiued of any his highnes officers of receipt, of or for that price. Neuertheles for the ſpace and tyme of two monethes after, that is to ſay, vnto the ende and laſt day of Iuly next folowyng, his highnes is content that all good & lawful Teſtons at his Maieſties Myntes, ſhalbe receiued for bullion after the rate of xii. d. the piece of any perſon who ſhall bryng them thether. And further that it ſhalbe lefull to any mā to buy any good and lawful Teſtons of he ſayd coyne and ſtamp of the late kyng, and made in any of the Myntes within this realme of England, to that intent to bryng theim to the Myntes of any perſon not diſpoſed to bryng them himſelfe: So that he do buye them for no leſſe price then after xi. d. ob. the piece and not vnder, vpon paine that whoſoeuer for his owne gredynes and lucre, ſhall buye any ſuche Teſtons for leſſe value then after xi. d. ob. the piece, to the domage of the poore men, who would ſell the ſame, ſhal forfaite therfore the Teſtons ſo bought and ten tymes the value of them, wherof one moytie to the kynges Maieſtie, the other to the demaunder of the ſayd forfaite, by bill, accion of debte or informacion in any of the kynges Maieſties courtes of Recorde, where no eſſoyne, proteccion nor wager of lawe ſhall ſerue or be allowed. And his highnes further is content that all his officers and miniſters may receiue all ſuche good and lawful Teſtons, and ſo repay them againe vnto his highnes after theſayd price of xi. d. ob. the piece, duryng onely theſayd monethes of Iune and Iuly. In the whiche tyme for that price of xi. d. ob. the piece, they ſhall refuſe no lawfull & good Teſtons of any his highnes ſubiectes. After the whiche laſt day of the moneth of Iuly next folowyng his highnes expreſſe will and pleaſure by the aduiſe aforeſayd is, that the coyne called Teſtons of his highnes father kyng Henry theightes ſtamp, ſhall neither be receiued of his highnes officers, no of none others, nor yet at the Myntes or exchaunge, as coyne or money of any valuacion but after ſuche ſorte as plate or any other ſtraunge bullyon is, or then ſhalbe, that is to ſay, accordyng to the rate of the ſtandard, and the quantitie of fine ſiluer in them contayned, and none otherwiſe.
