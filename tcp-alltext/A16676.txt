But so apparant is your Lustre, that it borroweth no light but from your selfe; no eminence but from the lampe of your honour, which is euer ready to excite the vertuous

to the vndertaking of labours well meriting of their Countrey, and generally profitable to all estates. In Subiects of this nature (my Honourable Lord) I cannot finde any more exact then these Suru

               Halcyons daies of peace and tranquillity, haue reason to reserue some time for the solemnizing this peaceble Armour of Histories; where we may see in what bonds of duety and affection wee are tied to the Almighty, not onely in hauing preserued vs from many hostile incursions, but in his continuing of his loue towards vs, wee cannot well dijudicate of comforts but in relation of discomforts: Nor is peace with so generall acceptance entertained by any, as by them who haue sustained the extremities of warre. Many precedent experiments haue wee had, and this Ile hath tasted of misery with the greatest, and now reuiued in her selfe, should acknowledge her miraculous preseruation, as not proceeding from her owne power, but deriued from the supreme influence of heauen, whose power is able to erect, support, demolish, & lay wast as he pleaseth: Hinc Timor, Hinc Amor. Hence wee haue argument of

Feare and Loue. Feare from vs to God, Loue from God to vs: Cause wee haue to feare, that subiect not our vnderstandings to the direct line and square of reason, but in our flourishing estate (imitating that once renowned Sparta) who was—Nunquam minus faelix quam cum felix visa—Abuse those excellent gifts we haue receiued, contemning the meanaces of heauen, and drawing vpon our selues the viols of Gods wrath, heauier diffused, because longer delayed. Wee should recollect our selues, and benefite our vngratefull mindes with these considerations: that our present felicity be not buried in the ruines of a succeeding calamity. These Histories (my Noble Lord) bee the best representments of these motiues. And in perusing discourses of this nature (next to the Sacred Word of God) we are strangely transported aboue humane apprehension, seeing the admirable foundations of Common-weales planted (to mans thinking) in the port of security, wonderfully ruinated: Grounding their dissolution vpon some precedent crying sinne, which laid their honour in the dust, and translated their Empire to some (perchance) more deseruing people. Here ciuill warres, the originall causes of the Realmes subuersion: there ambition bred by too long successe: Here Emulation in vertue, the first erectors of a flourishing Empire: there Parasites, the Scarabe of Honour, the corrupters of Roiallie disposed affections, and the chief

And generally obserue wee may in our humane Compositions, nothing so firme as to promise to it selfe constancy, so continuate as assure it selfe perpetuity, or vnder the cope of heauen, any thing so solid as not subiect to mutability. This Suruey (my Lord) haue I presumed to Dedicate to your Honour, not for any meriting discourse which it comprehends, but for the generality of the Subiect: Your protection will raise it aboue it selfe, and make me proud to haue an Issue so highly Patronized: it presents it selfe with feare, may it be admitted with Honour: So shall my labours be in all duety to your fauour deuoted, my prayers exhibited, and my selfe confirmed

               IN the suruey of Histories, the true Relators of things done, with a probable collection of things to come, by precedent euents: I thought good compendiously to contract some especiall caueats, as well for obseruance in Historical Discourses, as for preuention of such inconueniencesA three-fold diuision.

We may read no state in her selfe so secure, but may be shaken, exemplified well in Rome, the Gouernesse of ample Territories, and now made subiect to those which were her subiects: no Prince of so prosperous imploymen

                  s) delighted that chaste Greeke Penelope: Theseus Trauels Ariadne, or Alcides Labours Omphale. But to the vse of Historie. Historie being a minte of profit and delight, the seasoning of more serious studies, the reporter of cases adiudged by euent, the enterlude of our haps, the image of fortune, the compendiarie director of affaires, the representer of humane successe, the infallible character (by collation had with things past, and things to come) of succeding euents: should not aime at lasciuious stories, amorous subiects (vnlesse by way of disgression to smooth a serious discourse with a modest insertion of mirth) but to prosecute the argument of the Historie without friuolous Ambages, or impertinent circumstances. Affectation ill beseemes an Historian: For hee should vnderstand what office he supports; not any thing draind from his owne inuention, but to performe the charge of sincere relation. I approue of his oppinion that thought, Inuention to be least needfull to an Historian, but disposition more then to any. It is sufficient for an Historian to expresse what hee hath read or seene, truly, without concealing any thing, in partiall r

The Phylosopher thought a poore man was not to be an historian: for necessity would inforce him temporise and obserue humors: Nor a rich man, for he had his eye fixed vpon his estate, and durst not vn-rip great mens errors, lest he should loose by his labours.

But I disaprou

                his censure, and refell it with anothers opinion of the same sect: Si diues de fortunis & infortunijs scribat, sie enim vtrius

The error of iudgement should not be appropriated either to want, or eminence of fortune: for so should we subiect the inward to the outward, the intellectuall power to the externall varnish, preferring the eye of the body before the light of the minde. Yet to intermeddle in estates, so much as to dis-able them (by extenuating theit powers) lessening their reuenewes, or ecclipsing their pristine honour and eminence, by mentioning some insuccessiue euents they haue had by warre, or other occurrents, I wholly disallow it, proceeding either from priuate enmity to the state, or from a malevolent nature (vnfitting for so good a professour) apt to sting all, because an enmy to himselfe and all. States should not bee laid too open: but when occasion serues to describe the seates of Countries, Regions, &c. or to touch the manners and conditions of inhabitants, how they liue, and to what trades most inclined, with whom they haue commerce or the like, will not derogate any thing from the scope of an History, or any way implye a digression. It is thought, (and that by the Authentickst Historians) that Caesar; by the description of U

            And (doubtlesse) there is nothing which inflames the minde of man more vnto valour and resolution, then the report of the acts of their Auncestors, whose

This discourse therefore should not bee emploied in any thing saue in excitements to Glory, motiues to warlike designes; since by it valour is quickened, a desire of honour inflamed, Countries fame dispersed, and Monuments of neuer dying glory erected: O then who should so disalow the precious treasure of a refined discourse, as to mix it with impudent and scurrilous inventions; such fictions as are not onely in themselues fabulous, but to the vnstaid Reader (of which sort wee haue too many) mortally dangerous. Which fables (in my opinion) fall among the impertinent and feagured Tables called Milesiz; onely aiming at the depravation of manners, and the effeminating best resolued Spirits.

            But let vs returne to the office of a good Historian.

He will not write but vpon singular Grounds, reasons impregnable; conferring with the best to make his Narrations confirmed of the Best: Hee writes the stories of Princes truely without concealing their errours (by way of silencing them) or comment vpon an History, annexing to it an vnnecessary glosse. He will not be so ingaged to any, as that he will be restrained of his scope; or so countermanded, as that he must of necessity illustrate vice, vertue cannot passe without her character: A good Historian will alwaies expresse the actions of good men with an Emphasis, to sollicite the Reader to the affecting the like meanes, whereby hee may attaine the like end. This was the cause all the Noble Heroes in ancient time did liue to posteritie their acts to imitate: not so much for record of their owne memorable lifes, as for the propagating their Countries eternall honour by succeding Worthies. As those establishers of good and wholesome Lawes made themselues with their Countrie renowned: Mynois and Radamanth among the Cretensians; Orpheus among the Thracians, Draco and Solon in Athens, Lycurgus in Lacedemon, Zamolx is among the Scythians: Nor bee Historians (if so the Professours merite that style) of lesse esteeme then the prudentest and most experienced Statists. For these direct euery Senatour in polliticke affaires by producing such as excelled in administration of iustice, describing the very natures of such Lawes, and the causes why such Lawes were enacted to present times.
            These Ages haue beene, and are to this day, much
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   of Transcriptories. indebted to Transcriptions, Inventions are oft times slow, where the application of things inuented to the present State seemes more facile and easy: Hereto then should the scope of Histories tend; not onely to personate the acts of men vpon the Theater of this world, but likewise to cull out such Lawes, Orders, and Precepts, as well Morall as Diuine, which may benefiet

their present estate. Sysambris skin was a good caueat for succeding Iudges: Iustice before went on crutches, and more were troubled with Demosthenes disease then with Phoycions bluntnesse. The Historian must not sow pillowes to the elbowes of Magistrates, nor sooth corruption with an humour of shadowing vice: He showes what was done: and commends the one to reprehend the other. Vertue neuer wants her character, nor vice her reproofe: For such Hystoricall Relations as induce to vertue and deterre from vice, comprehend in them the true vse of such Subiects, being Apologeticall and Morall to reforme, not Mylesian or prophane to deforme or disfigure the exact simmetree of a vertuous Idiome. No maruell if Alexander laid the workes of Homer vnder his head, being such as directed him how to be a Head, how to gouerne Prouinces, how to sway his inordinate affections; so as Cleanthes Fable (vertues best elucidary) had her Liberall Sciences neuer better portraied, then the differences twixt true fortitude, and a foole-hardy boldnesse were by Homer deblazoned. Here a Hectors badge of true valour, there an Antenor whose grauity purchas'd him honour: there a Diomedes no lesse wise then resolued, here a Troilus stoutnesse but vnaduised here warres well managed abroad, but lesse successiue at home, examplefied in Agamemnon, there a subtile scouce, no lesse frieghted with pollocy then successe in Sinon. All these are expressed by that Heriocke Historian.
            
               Qui quid sit pulchrum, quid turpe quid vtile, quid non?

            These acts couid not but minister sufficient matter of admiration to such Iudicious Readers, as apprehended each circumstance in the subiect; making that apt connexion of all, that the body might seeme more

excellent, by the proportioning of euery member. Seuerall fruits of History. Histories in themselues are diuerse, producing seuerall fruits to the pervsers, according to euery mans affection: Which made that moderne Historian compare them to a Banquet, wherein were to be serued seuerall dishes; some to prouoke appetite, others to satiate, more delightfull subiects penned for relishing more serious studies, grauer discourses to ripen the vnderstanding, by applying the instructions of forraine States to our owne iudgements: where we may make vse of the best part of man (in his reasonable power) and that is Election: approuing of what is good, or may in it selfe be beneficiall to the State: and slieghtly obseruing discourses of indifferency, as accomplements, ceremonies, circumstances, and the like, resembling faire frontespices which are made rather for ornament then vse. It is necessary for a good Historian to haue maturity of iudgement, to apprehend what is fittest for his discourse, and to be as little complemental as may be, lest the varnish marre the worke; for the words of an History in my opinion iumps with Mirandula:—Vt non sint le

Some haue imputed the cause to certaine expostulations betwixt the two Princes, which grew afterwards to words of publicke reproach and infamy; vpbraiding each other with diuers insolencies offered by their Countries, one to another. What ere the motiue of this dissention was (how varied soeuer the opinions of Writers beeA mischicuous plot. herein) the braine that contriued it was sure the forge of great impiety, and an irrepairable detriment to the Christians, exposing them to ruine, slaughter, and desolation.

               For the first, I neuer knew any Discourse worth reading, proceed from so base and ignoble Merchants: They sell their workes by retaile; and hope of a gainefullA Flattering Historian. Dedicatory, makes them contemne Methode, Truth, Subiect and all: Irus skrippe is open, relieue but the needy Artist, hee will imitate the Bohemian Curre, fawne on a good suite: shew the proiect of his intendments to him, and protest him, he will insert monumentall Characters of honour to grace thee; onely bestow thy bounty, and shew not thy selfe vnworthy of so fabulous an Attendant: His inuention is tied to his Benefactors: then dries the source of his fancy, when they restraine the spring of their bounty. These two sorts (as not worthy an Historicall Title) haue I proscribed the bounds of my discourse: if betwixt such two dangerous shelues, I can finde a retired harbour for the truly named Historian to breath himselfe in, I haue attained my wished expectance. The meane betwixt these two, giues vs obseruation of noting causes and effects, how produced, and how ended: counsels and successes, how intended, how administred: then he proceeds further, making resemblance betwixt nature and nature, state and state, the gouernment of this prouince and of that: then differences of actions & euent: some wisely carried, bearing themselues faire, and promising a compleat satisfaction to the vndertaker: yet what opposition betwixt the end and beginning, ruine being the period, or extreme of his hopes. Many such opposite Conuersions, or Catastrophes rather, may we daily see in the managements of warres: who more happy in his Countries protection, and who more successiue in his prosecution, then Pompey the great in his first entrance to martiall exploits? Yea, (as Caesar acknowledged himselfe) he had conquered, if he hadVicisses, si te vicisse, cognouisses. knowne when he had conquered: yet in euent, whose designes more vnhappy? Not onely depriued of the bent of his hopes, proscribed (as it were) his natiue

Such discourses often moueMouing Historians. in men a commiseration, in seeing Vertue so ill guerdoned, and Vice (vnder a counterfeit garbe) of Innocence receiue an immerited reward: And this certainly haue most Historians euer obserued in their writings: so liuely to expresse the disasters of deseruing men, that their relations might moue a kinde of sensible pitty and remorce in the peruser, which is best exemplified by circumstances: for the time, place, cause, and person, with other necessary adiuncts, do (for the most part) lay a more open and smooth Tract to the inforcement of passion. Lucan, that heroicke Historian, brings forth Cornelia sitting vpon the shore, where her husband tooke his last farewel of her: where (like another Niobe) she makes a Limbeck of her eyes, and descants her owne calamity, oft wishing his returne; and when depriued of his sight, yet the eye of her imagination represents a new obiect of sorrow. Here, in such royall compositions, and funerall conclusions, he describes the diuersity of nature, in two contrary subiects: a seruant faithfull, sitting ore the headlesse trunkHow to moue passion, and by what circumstances. of his vnhappy mnister: a slaue as vngratefull, haling his once well-esteemed Lord and Generall to the fatall shore: where (without taste of remorce, remembrance of former merits, or regard of Countries loue) he depriues him of life. Such Tragicke occurrents require their Emphasis, and a kinde of vn-vsuall working passion: that the History may present to our eyes, the very acts how they were done; making her discourse (as it is) a Theater of humane actions. I know pittifullLiuely impressions of remorce drawne from the son towards the father. stories haue strange effects, if amply described: For warriers themselues in the report of their owne mis-fortunes (of all men most pittilesse) haue hardly contained themselues from teares: Aeneas, wept

to see the ruines of his Countrey so liuely depictured in Didoes Hall: But when he beheld his poore father Anchises hanging on his owne shoulders (hauing no other refuge in so imminent disasters,) Suspiria mittit, hee could weepe no longer: for teares mittigate griefe; but with a passionate silencing of his miseries, treasured his vn-vtterable woes in the balefull centre of his heart.

            This was the first step of preferment vnto Cicero, defending Roscius against Scilla: and that with such vehemency, as generally hee was approued for his seriousnesse in a poore Actors cause. And sure generous mindes cannot be better expressed then in actions of this nature, whereby they may not onely secure themselues and their entirest affections from the friuolent assaults of irregular perturbations; but also purchase vnto him, the generall loue and fauour of such as obserue their disposition, and admire it.

Ita vt ne in castris quidem nimium ocij detur: Alwayes was this puissant Prince much giuen to see the naturall qualities of beasts, so as no present could bee more gratefull, or acceptable to him, then some strangely natured sauage, making excellent vse of this Theory, appropriated to the natures of men: which vpon all occasions (with singular delight) hee vsed to apply vnto his Nobles disposition, which attended him.

before a pearle.
            Yet in these labours (in themselues praise-worthy) I altogether disalow such (of which our reading ministers too many examples) that haue digged the Sepulchres of the dead, to finde some hidden treasure buried with them. A sharpe law was enacted (for this end) amongst the Aegyptians, (which nation vsed to interre their chiefest Iewels with the dead party) that whosoeuer should violate the sacred rites of the dead, by digging vp their Treasures inchested with them, should be buried quicke.

            There be three things which be especially required in Histories of this nature, to make them perfect: first Truth, in

               incerely relating, without hauing any thing (as Tacitus obserueth)

                  , foisted in by our owne inuention, to smooth the passage of our story.
            Secondly, an explanation in discouering, not onely the sequels of things, but also the causes and reasons drawing to the conclusions.
            Thirdly, iudgement in distinguishing things by approuing the best, and disallowing the contrary.
            For the first, stories should be true, or at least resembleHistories should be true truth, because by so much, they are more pleasing, by how much they resemble truth the neerer; and so much more gracefull, by how much more probable and doubtfull: we haue many Histories (euen of this kinde) mixed, that comprehend in them nothing lesse then truth: yet by their smooth carriage, and their proper▪ circumstances with such aptnesse drained and disposed, they haue been taken for truth, and registred amongst workes of more s
                  •…
               rious consequence.
            Such were those Apologae Fabulae (whereof we haue in part spoken before) which contained in them many pitthy and graue 
                  〈◊〉
               , and worthy obseruation in the excellentest Moral: these are fitly called by Tully, Mirrors of Mans life, Patternes of Manners, and Images of truth. Their neere resemblance of truth, made

the reader more attentiue, subiecting his eare to Discourses probable, more then to things surpassing the bounds and limits of beliefe, as producing vnheard of miracles (meere conceptions of the braine) phanaticke Chymeras: A Gyant immured in a rocke, yet able to pierce it through, win a whole Monarchy with his owne single hands, lead a multitude of Kings captiues, and returne home without a wound. Here strange Inchaunted Castles, Ladies and Knights detained in most base seruitude by an Airy Monster: there admirable victories purchased vpon incredible, oddes: and to be belieued, it pleaseth the Painter so to deliniate their vertues.
            But of these erronious stories there be some obserue no methode, planting an Arcadie in a Brittanny:
               Absurdities in Historians of our time. as if by some super-natural accident there were a transplantation of Regions, or some Earth-quake in the Authors braine, whence this immane Colosse of an irregular Discourse proceeded. Which strange representations be not vnlike to your Lanskip; where vpon the sea, whatsoeuer we see, by land, seemes in our saile to go with vs: Euen so do these vain Historians make strange obiects vnto vs, of places impossible, transiting whole Countries to make an impolished straine of pastorall musicke (one good Bell-weather would make as perfect harmony) sound well in a Clownes eare.
            To be short, my opinion positiuely is this: That Historian which can ioyne profite with a modest delight together in one body or frame of one vnited discourse, grounding his story vpon an essentiall truth, deserues the first and principall place: and he who (vpon a fained discourse) can proportion it to a likenesse of truth, merits the next. As for him that (like one of Duke Humphreyes Knights) obserues neither meane nor measure, but gorge their own insatiate appetites with full messes of vntruths (without probability) should be

dealt withall, as that wandring Italian Squire was vsed, for his monstrous lying: Tost in a Blanket, till his erring spirit by suffumigations, or some such like meanes, were canuased out of him.
            Great blemishes these be to so reputed a Profession, aiming neither at profite nor modest delight, but imitating your Mercenary Actors, spurt out some obsoene ieast to make a prophane Rogue applaud him: and sure if the strict doome, and censure, of banishment, were to be inflicted vpon any kinde of learning, rather should it be pronounced against such as these then any. The Pagans haue abhorred them and much more odious should they bee in a Christian Common-wealth, where vertue should be the scope of all our actions.
            They are like some Comoedies wee reade now a daies; The first Act whereof is in Asia, the next in Affrica, the third in Europa, the fourth in America: and if Ptolomeus, or Marcus Paulus had found out a fi

Much they speake of vallour, and many imaginary Heroes are pitching their Pauillions; But I will take my leaue of them with my French Prouerbe: Beaucoup de bruit, è peu de fruict: Much bruite, but little fruite: Battels more fierce (by report) then Alcahors: That was but Kings, their's Giants: and one of those Giants as able to vanquish all those Kings, as for Milo to carry his Bull on his shoulders.
            For the second: Their should be an explanation inExplanation in discouery of causes. discouery of the causes, with a direct and graduall proceeding to the sequels: As thus; in description of a solemne Iust, or Tournament, it is necessary for the Historian to show the cause why such solemnities

were instituted: I do know many things there be in Discourses, which may be as well implyed as inserted; But in Festiuals, solemne Games, euents of Duellors, or publicke Trials: The causes forcing should and ought to be as well deciphered, as the ends succeeding: How should we haue knowne of the vniting of the Sabines with the Romanes, or the occasion of their Marrying together, but by those dissembled feasts ordained by Romulus, to bring his purpose to effect: The circumstances of which feast (are with a certaine concordancy) amongst most of the Romane Writers agreed on; standing (though with too nice prec

               senesse) I confesse vpon the place, occasion, and houre of the day, with such a liuely Transcription, as if the Sabine Rape had bene committed in their time.
            The like we reade of the destruction and vtter subuersion of the Gabians, in the time of Tarquin Superbus: The generall vnion of Historians, about the time, place, and occasion, so concordantly iumping, as if all those proceedings (as well in the Stratagemes by Tarquins yongest sonne, as the very Contents ofA concord in circumstances amongst Historians. that Letter writ by the father to his sonne, for the management of this exploite) had bene set downe by one pen.
            The like in that Combat, or bloudy Banquet rather of Thomyris her eldest sonne, and the Persian Cyrus, with such natiue descriptions of euery circumstance, the Riuer Araxis, the place of their passage, the reasons which moued Thamyris to suffer their passage, and the very plot where their Tents were pitcht, their dainty viands left for the Scythian surffet, in what sort prepared, & how insatiably desired by the Scythian army, comming rather to feast then to fight: And then their defeate, being there vanquished, where they were most confident of victory.
            In these explanations, the Reader should not be delayed, or frustrated too much in his hopes, by vnnecessary

ambages: We should not trifle out the time in vaine and impertinent repetitions, it cloies and satiates the appetite too much: not vnlike to your great feasts, reseruing the choycest dainties for the end, when the appetites of the Guests are satisfied before they come: It is a good frugall course, and includes an Occonomicke pollicy, their best dishes may be preferued for another time: He that discouers euents and sequels without their precedent causes, is as one that would draw a Riuer dry, without knowing whence the Spring is deriued: applying the conclusions of things, as it pleased the Ethnickes in ancient time, to reserre them to the arbitriment of Fortune; making euer this womanish argument: The euent was so, because it was so; and it was so because fate would haue it so: answering Titus opinion, Potestates fato dari: But these which thus apply the course of all conclusions to fortune, be as blind as Fortune: Nay, farre more; for though Fortune be blind, yet she is not inuisible: But these men are not onely blind in the eye of common sence, but invisible in the composure of their owne Arguments; their Conclusions being as blind as themselues.
            In making likewise our iudgement of Histories, and considerately applying it to our present interests, we must specially regard the dispositions of the Agents, and dilligently remarke how they are affected in minde, this is the least dece

               uing ground of forming opinion: By the nature of the Agent, coniecturall euents or reasons of euents may be drawne: As if an ambitious man be imployed in Embassage twixt Prince and Prince, he is to be suspected that his Treaty will be lesse happy, in that his illimited Passions oftimes, rather aggrauate then allay causes of ciuill discord. Men of moderate dispositions, purchase peace with lesse adoe, and more successefull; For Princes (ballancing their owne wrongs, to their apprehension

insupportable) cannot endure brauing▪ butThe Euent gathered by foregoing causos. will rather try the extreamest of Fortune, then be vnworthy of themselues, by hearing and bearing affronts with patience.

                  s for Pernassus in these daies, where Noble (yet degenerate Spirits) esteeme him that will be Pandor to his Punke, aboue him that will be Patron to a Poem: It seemes strange that in best experienc't times, where knowledge should be hightned, the foggy vapours of ignorance dispelled: Nay, where these times haue respite from warlike Alarums, and therefore may securely feede at Mineruaes Table, should be so delighted with superficiall shadowes, contemning the perfect essence and lustre of man, (to wit) how to know himselfe. Here the Miser digs (and with the Dormouse) sleepes out his time in a fruitlesse scraping; There the Prodigall (carelesse of times expence) bastardizeth his fathers Prouidence, leauing no more to himselfe, then that he could not take from himselfe, a poore Graue: Heere the Ambitious man, displaying his pie-coulored flags of vanity (in the elation of his Spirit) contemnes the inferiour ranke of men, euer aiming at an higher sphere then popular presse, till his aspiring produce his falling, and the honour which he purchast without merite, forsakes him not without shame: But which of these will take paines to see himselfe represented in exemplary Histories? If the picture of old Menedemus were hung vp in the eye of the Miser (he would I doubt it not) gaze with his foure eyes on the Picture, but make little or no vse on the Patterne: The Ambitious man, if he saw the character of himselfe in that vast and indetermined minde of Catyline, in that ambitiously insinuating spirit of Sejan, I feare me he would rather make vse of the meanes of his rising then caution himselfe by his vntimely declining: The Prodigall (expressing his owne Mirrour, by Theotimus

               The greatest and mouingst argument of perswasionVse of History. to the vndertaking of this or that, is the benefite we expect redounding from our enterprise: I will succinctly expresse the seuerally mouing effects of profite (the worldly mans Admant) from History, Naturally and Essentially deriued: which being laid open, I hope the Miser (who as Seneca noteth, is good to none, but worst to himselfe) will be profitable both to himselfe and others: My exordium shall be drawne from him, because I take him to be one of the deuils chiefest Factours, and more benefite should I yeeld my Country in bringing in such a one, then in taking an Arch-pirate: From him descending to euery vitious professour (binding my selfe euer to my tackling) the fruite of History in it selfe able to reclaime the deprauedst from their habituated enormities.

I will Anatomise the Misers corruptions, and like an artificiall practitioner first open his wounds, and then infuse Balme into them; which Vnction if it will not serue, I shall then apply more rough and sharpe plaisters.
