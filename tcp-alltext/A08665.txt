Esquyer.
            
               WHen I had employed
sometime in translating
Ouids Metamorphos

                  s,
and had achyued my
purpose in parte therof,
intendyng to haue
trauayled further: I vnderstoode
that another had preuented me. And
so, after that I had receyued copyes
therof from the Prynter, I was resolued
to stay my laboure, & to reserue
that to the vse and behofe of my pryuat
frend: whych I intēded to haue
made comen to euery man. How be it
because I knowe my selfe on dyuers
causes aleged to your worship, being
no lesse lerned your selfe, then affectioned
to euery cōmendable faculty, hauyng
nothyng more fyt at this tyme:
I thoughte it good to gratefye you
wyth some part therof, and that not

altogether vnder the note and figure
according to the text. Aplyenge also
a morall to the Fable. And because it
hath pleased you vppon youre good
wyll, rather then for the worthynes
hereof, to accept & cōmend my Copye
in wrytyng: I am now therfore bold
to publysh it in prynte vnder the patronage
of your name. The rather to
amēd the volume of thys other history.
And thus neither my first labours
shall altogether syncke: nor I shall
seeme to abuse the wryter, or reader
of those foure bookes of Metamorphosis,
whych be so learnedly translated all
redye. Thus yours for his small
powre assured. Wis

               Was subiecte more then this, as we
               by thend may playnly see.
               For Cupide he doth yet now lyue
               a stoborne wytlesse boye:
               But Hermaphrodite death at laste
               had power for to dystroye.
               How be it by dolefull dome, he lost
               hym selfe before he dyed.
               Such was his lot. Yet seemes it straūge

               the rather dyd I choose
               To wryte of hym whose lot it was
               by ill lucke hym selfe to loose.
               Amonge a thousand storyes whych
               are worthy to be scande,
               In golden verse by skylfull pen,

               ¶But now thys sonne of Mercuryes
               
               in Ida mounte was fed,
               And fostred: thear, full fyftene yeres
               hys lyfe also hee led.
               And then desyrous for to know
               the state of countreys straunge,
               
                  All Licia land, by trauayle great
               to Caria he dyd range.
               Wheras vppon a tyme, what wyth
               hys trauayle that was great,
               And eke the weather being hote
               he weryed then wyth heate,
               And redy for to rest hym selfe,
               by chaunce he dyd espye
               A well, wyth water fayre and clere
               as Chrystall to the eye.
               Whych nether bushe at any tyme
               nor wede it ouer grew.
               Much lyke vnto the well it was,
               wherto Acteon drew,
               When that Diana, and her Nymphes
               al naked in the same
               He saw, by chaunce as he dyd seke
               hys lately coursed game.
               Aboute thys sprynge an idle Nymphe,
               fayre Salmacis dyd vse:
               Whych euen as soone as wyth her eies,
               the yonge man fayre she vewes,
               Strayght set on fyre: The smoldrynge heate
               doth strike vnto her harte,
               And thorow persed by the dynte,
               of cruell Cupydes darte.
               She strayght desyres with him to ioyne,
               her luste for to fulfyll.
               
                  She tryms her selfe, & goes foorth with
               for to declare her will.
               To whom when that she came: strayght waie
               With comely grace she gan to saye.
               O worthy child, whose shape doth shew,
               (as it doth seeme to mee.)
               That surely thou some god, and not
               a earthly wyght shulde bee.
               Ryght happy are thy parentes sure,
               and eke the Nurce in lap
               Which hath the layd oft tymes, & geuen
               thy louely lyps the pap.
               But happyest of them bothe I saye,
               a blessed one is shee,
               Whych as thy wyfe within one bead
               myght ioyne her selfe with thee.

                  ute,
               graunt my request I pray,
               That if you be not maryed yet
               then, then graunt thys I saye,
               That I may rest my happy lyms
               in blessed bed with thee,
               So I with Iuno for to chaunge
               my state wolde not agree,
               If thou be maryed, let me steale
               one turne. My harte, my ioye,
               She sayd, and therwyth held her peace.
               But lo the shame fast boye
               
                  Was dasht, and out of countenaunce cleane.
               he blusht as red as blood,
               He wyst not then what loue dyd meane.
               it wolde haue done one good,
               To see how wel the blusshyng shame,
               The amased boy as it became.
               ¶Such was his lyuely countenaunce,
               such was hys comely hew.
               Whom when the Nymphe had long beheld,
               not able to subdewe
               Her heat affection and desyre.
               not able to susteyne,
               The force of those so feruent flames,
               she doth attempte agayne
               By other meanes to try the boy,
               eche practyce doth she proue.
               But nought at al could moue hys harte
               being rude, as yet to loue.
               She seketh to imbrace his necke,
               and asketh for a kysse.
               But then the boy resystyng her
               was moued much wyth thys,
               And sayd leue of these wanton tryckes,
               no lenger troble mee,
               Els wyll I soone be gone, and leue
               the place and all with thee.
               Then Salmacis afrayde, dyd make
               as thence she wolde be gone.
               
                  But in a bushe harde by the same,
               she hyd her selfe anon.
               The boy thought now that al was safe
               from shame as yet now free
               Does of hys clothes, and thynketh sure
               that none the same doth see.
               And lyke a wanton Kyd he skyppes
               and in the mead doth run.
               Then in the well, to bathe hys feete,
               he so at fyrst begon
               But thus at last the water cleare
               it doth delyght hym so.
               He geues hys body to the streames
               and wadeth to and fro,
               And further foorth with softely foote
               he doth begyn to go.
               ¶At last wyth armes out stretched hee
               hys body clene doth dyp.
               By swīming, through the siluer stremes
               hys yuery corps doth slyp.
               The Nimph this while, beholdyng him,
               no longer then could staye,
               But of her mantel being throwne
               she wold leape in strayght way.
               The boy amyd the waues doth swym
               as whyte as any snow.
               No swan could seme more whyte thē he
               that euer any sawe.
               
                  The Nimphe her hart doth pant wt

               Untyll her garmentes all were of.
               shee plyeth so her praye.
               Euen as the eger mastyue Dogge,
               whom scant hys keper stayes,
               But at the bayted Beare he stryues
               for to be gone alwayes.
               Euen as the Hauke doth ba

                  e, when that
               shee sees the Partryge spronge:
               So Salmacis, to her it seemes
               Eche tyme it is to longe,
               That lets her from the pray. But loe,
               as mery as a Pye,
               The boy doth friske and play, he thyncks
               that none may hym espye.
               But as the 
                     •
                  are within her fourme,
               when shee doth feare no ill:
               The hounde is on her sodeynlye,
               then prest the foole to kyll.
               So Salmacis vnto her praye,
               into the water goes:
               As though that then for al the worlde
               her luste she wolde not lose.
               Not to perswade hym how she meanes,
               as shee dyd erst before:
               But now sheys prest her lust to serue,
               or els to dye therfore.
               
                  She it to folly so full inclynde:
               That nothing then might chaunge her mind.
               ¶But lo the boy, as soone as he
               dyd theare the Nymphe espy,
               Euen as the lytle Roche wyth synnes
