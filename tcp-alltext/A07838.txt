Saluation by Christ Iesus.
            
               IT is a diuine truth (Worthy Lord) though
crossing humane sense, spoken by the Father

My power is perfited in weakenesse:
That is to say,Calv. Com. in 2. Cor. 12 9. 
               The assisting hand of
God is then most lightsomly discerned,
when the weakenes of man hath most euidently appeared.
As the great Antesignanus of all the Interpreters most pithily
doth expound it. As for example: Gods diuine Spirit, did then
most sensibly shewe it selfe in Iacob, whenGen. 49. hee prophecied so
powerfully lying sicke vpon his death bed. In Dauid, whenPsal. 6. & 51. & alibi. he
prayed so seruently, almost ouerwhelmed with troubles. In Paul,
whenAct. 16. 
                     •
                  4, 25. he sang so cheerefully, fastened in the stockes. In S. Laurence,
whenAmbr Oshe. lib. 1. he spake so couragiously, broyling on the gridi

               when men are weake, then they are strong:
weake in the flesh, strong in the spirit, weake in themselues,
strong in the grace of God.
            All humane infirmities are in nature destructiue: They arise



from sinne:

            And as it is with bodily infirmities, so is it generally with all
afflictions. They are like Quick-siluer and Henbane, and such
other creatures, which though they be poisonable in nature, yet
they are made medicinable by art. The Scripture compareth
them sometimes to fire: Peter calleth them1. Pet. 4 12. 
               the firery tryall.
Sometimes to water,
               Psal. 59. 1. 
               The waters are entered euen into
my soule. In one of the Psalmes they are both conioyned:Psal. 66. 12. 
               trans

water. The resemblance is many wayes significant: For fire
warmeth, and fire consumeth; water refresheth, and water
choaketh. And this they doe, either as they serue vnder men,
or domineer ouer men: for, They are cruell masters, but profitable
seruants, saith our English Prouerb. So it is with men,
and their afflictions. Where they master (as they d
                  •
                in the wicked)
there they choake and consume them: but where they serue
(as they do in the saints) there they warme and refr
                  •
               sh them. In
so much as Dauid professed,Psal. 119. 71. 
               Bonum est, It is good for mee
that I haue beene afflicted. And one of the Fathers very notably,
                  
                     〈…〉

the Lord Iesus doth not otherwise or more effectually raigne in
his heart, but euen by affliction.
            
            I prosecute the Scriptures comparison yet a little farther.
Plinie writeth, that there are some creatures,Plin. l. 11. c. 36. which li

true in the Metaphor. The children of God liue, and like, and
thriue in the fire of affliction: as the children of IsraelExod. 1.

               Apuscidamus in Africa. Now of that
kind, are all the waters of trouble to the children of God.
They sinke not in them, they euer float aboue, as safe as in Noahs
Arke vpon the face of the waters.2. Cor. 4. 8. 
               We are afflicted (saith
S. Paul) yet are we not in distresse: in pouertie, but not
ouercome of pouertie. We are persecuted, but not forsaken:
cast downe, but we perish not. The reason is,Psal. 37. 24. 
               The
Lord putteth vnder his hand, to hold them vp as it were by
the chinne, that they sinke not in those waters. Yea further, the
Spirit of God isMatth. 3. 11. 
               fire, andIoh. 3. 5. 
               water it selfe: with which Spirit
they beeing baptized, their troubles are all so spiritually sanctified,
that they consume them not, nor choake them not: but
they serue like fire to warme their zeale, and like water to
coole the heat of flesh: and so many wayes to fit them better to
the workes of their callings.
            But whereunto now tendeth this dolefull treatie of Afflictions?
I write not this so much for you (mine honourable Lord)
whose pathes are on euery side so prosperous: though I doubt
not but you haue also your Crosses to beare, and which Crosses
thorough the grace of God, doe more sanctifie you and your actions.
But I take vp this Argument, ère nata (as the naturall
course is of Epistles) to shew how in the studying and acting
of this Sermon, The power of God hath appeared in my
weakenesse.

other reason but this: that God would shew his power in
my weakenesse. To him only be the glorie of all his gifts.
            Now, among the best, and best indicious sort of those mine
Hearers, I haue many reasons to seat and ranke your Lordship.
And that not onely for your eminencie of place in the
Common Wealth, which notwithstanding is of right high and



worthie respect: but also for that God hath giuen you so many
meanes of knowledge, so long practise in the heart of the State,
so deepe insight into your owne professed Lawes, and so carefull
a desire, to looke into our discourses of Diuinitie. All which
are euidences that against the malicious Calumnies of that
Romish Catholike Diuine; that your fingers are often turning
ouer bookes of all sorts,P. R. to the increase of all kind of knowledge.
It is true that your place hath many yeares called you to deale
about Capital matters: and the more businesse haue you had that
way a great deale by the treasonable practises of Romish & Antichristian
Diuines. But what saith S. Hierome?

and adulterous persons, is not that effusion of blood, which God
hath forbidden; but the administring of necessarie Lawes,
which God hath commanded. For my part I would that euen
their Catholike Diuines themselues, wouldIn Scorpiaco. 
               gladium stylo

leaue fingering of blood, euen of the sacred blood of Princes,
and fall more to the fingering of the bookes of holy Scripture;
and not suffer themselues therein to be outgone of our
Secular Iudges and temporall Magistrates, who besides matters
of Iustice, applie themselues also to the knowledge of Religion.

pleased so honourably to comfort me ouer this labour, and then

audacia, impudentia. Malice is at her chariot or caroch,
for shee is a loftie minded dame. This chariot is drawne along
on foure wheeles: crueltie, impatiencie, boldnesse, and
impudencie. Cruell shee is, shee will spare no mans name,
no not his life. Impatient shee is, shee will beare no mans infirmitie,
no not an error, though to erre be most humane. Bold
shee is, shee blurteth out all whatsoeuer shee knoweth. And
Impudent she is, no checke nor rebuke will snibbe her, to make
her hang the head. To stand therefore to such Iudges, were
halfe before-hand to condemne my selfe. But to learned men,
to temperate men, to studious men, to curteous men, to your
Lordship, and to your like, is this poore labour in all deuotion
most reuerently submitted.
            Now some things there are, in which I humbly craue fauourable
interpretation.
            1. As first that I doe not put vpon this Treatise in the penning,
that vigor and viuacitie which it carried in the preaching.
For there is euen in nature a great difference between the
tongue, and the quill, betweene speaking and writing. The very
sound and t
                  •
               ne of the voice is melodie to the eare: it beeing
the proper Obiect of that Sense. And thereof it is, that the



speciall part ofCie de or at 3. 
               Oratorie, is said to be Pronuntiation. And
besides that,Plutarch. de Socratis Genio. Et de placitis Philosop. l. 4. cap. 1
                     •
                  . 
               Vox est ictus animi: passing through the eare,
and braine, and blood, it smiteth (as it were) and giueth a
stroake vpon the verie soule, and so with a kind of violence doth
deepely affect it. Therefore it is called Viua vox, as that which
hath in it a speciall kind of liuelinesse. Hierome beeing absent,
turneth ouer Macclinus to Austen that was present:
Aug. 
                     •
                  om. 2. epist. 27. 
               qui viua (vt aiunt) voce docere te poterit: who (saith
S. Hierome) may teach thee thereby the liuely voice, better
then I can by an Epistle. But yet further, besides all the
worke of Nature, there is in Preaching a speciall gift of grace:
which enableth a man to speak with such euidence of the Spirit,
& with such power to the Conscience, as no pen of man by writing
can expresse: whereof Preaching is the most liuely and
effectuall instrument of saluation, and so to be respected.
            2. Secondly, I must craue pardon, that all things are not
here exactly set downe, in that order and forme in which they
were deliuered. Writing nothing at large, nor carrying with me
any helpe of my notes into the pulpit; some things might easily be
forgotten, which I premeditated, some things might be added,
which I premeditated not: some things might misse their due
place, and some things their due poize: some things might bee
enlarged,Plat
                     •
                  
                some things might be contracted more then I purposed:

               : It is not possible

                  nis.
               but things written will slippe out of memorie. I did that
in my yeares, which an other said he had done in his vigour,

               Orabam meditata loquens, tres tractus in horas.
To doe it without set forme of words, and to misse nothing either
of matter or manner, must be the act of a man of greater gifts
then my selfe. But new when I returned home, and after so many
requests, had resolued to commit that which I had said to
writing; I had no safer rule to walke by, then the method by
which I had in short notes digested my meditations. And therefore
in that forme, they come forth into the world.
            3. Thirdly, if any take offence at the multitude and multiplicitie



of mine allegations: I would haue them to knowe, that
as it is not mine vsuall manner of preaching in the countrie; so
here are many more Ouotations added, and some a great deale
more enlarged, then as they were at that time deliuered. Tullie
said of youth,Pro. M. Caelio. 
               Dandum est aliquid aetati: So say I in this case:
something must be giuen to this learned age, something to the
solemnitie of that place, and something to the expectation of the
hearers. Sure I am, that much was to be giuen to this Argument,
where the Position was to be ouerswaied by Antiquity,
for that the Doctrine is on all sides challenged of Noueltie. It
is hard I confesse, to hold The golden meane. But there is a
worse extremitie growne vp in preaching, which for reuerence
of mine owne coate, I will thus taxe from S. Augustine in an
allegorie:De serm. Domin in monte. lib. 1. 
               Aduertendum est, non sol

            I haue said, if not all that I would, yet all that I could,
the time so straightening me in the penning hereof, as I
haue scarse found leisure to read it ouer. My prayer is
now to Almightie God, that he would be pleased in mercie to
accept of these my poore endeauours, and to blesse them to the
good of his Church, for which they haue been vndertaken. And
for your Lordship, my supplicatiō shall euer be, that God would
vouchsafe to continue in you, that liuely, iustifying▪
                and sauing
faith, treated vpon in this Sermon, which may keepe you
from trembling here, and in the day of iudgement. So I take
my leaue. From Combes in Suffolke. Maij. 29. 1613.

            4. It is the Epistle of Iames the Apostle. So the best
Greeke copies have it. And those which 
                  〈◊〉
                the Gospels


               
and Epistles into the Syrian language, immediatly after
the Apostles times,Aretius in arg in Epist. Iac. 
               Iacobum Apostolum agnoscunt, acknowledge
this Iames for an Apostle. And so Tremellius
translateth it from the Syriake; Epistola Iaakub. Apostoli.
The Argument which Illirieus alleadgeth to the contrary,
viz. that this Iames
               In Epist. Iac. intituleth himself the seruant of Christ,
and not an Apostle; which he would not haue omitted (if
he had beene an Apostle,) maioris authoritatis gratia, for
the adding of authoritie to his writing; is (as a number of
his positions are) more subtill then iudicious. For Paul omitteth
his title of Apostleship to Philemon. So doth the
Author of the Epistle to the Hebrewes: and both Iohn and
Iude. in their Epistles. And besides, that is not nothing
which Lyranus alleadgeth to this purpose, thatLyra. in epist. Iacobi. 
               Iames
writing to the bragging Iewes, who carried themselues so
high aboue the Gentiles; to induce them by his example
to humilitie, non nominat se Apostolum, quod nomen est dignitutis:
sed servum quod nomen est subiectionis: he intituleth
not himselfe an Apostle, which is a name of dignitie, but
the seruant of Christ, which is a name of subiection.
            Now, this is here worth the noting, that this Epistle being
written by Iames and Apostle, it was not written by that
Iames that was syrnamed Oblias, whome the Apostles Peter,
Iames, and Iohn, are saide to haueEuseb. hist l. 2. cap. 1. ex Clement. lib 6. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . 
               ordained Bishop of
Ierusalem: though I am not ignorant thatEuseb. hist. 2. cap. 11. Niceph. l. 2. c. 38. Erasmus, Gualter. Test. Rhem. 
               Eusebius, and
those that follow him, doe so conceiue it, For that Iames,
though he were an holy and worthie disciple (as out of Egesippys
and Ios
                     •
                  phus is related) yet was he but a disciple,
and none of the twelue that were named Apostles. And
besides that, it is to me a great reason, which one of the
late writers hath alleadged in this case;Piscator. that to write a
Catholicke Epistle, that is, an Epistle common to many churches,
and not peculiar to any one, vi

seemeth to be an office peculiar to an Apostle.

be that Iames which is calledMat. 10. 3.

sonne of Zebede, who was put to death byAct 12. 2. 
               Herod anon
after the ascension of Christ. For this Epistle was written
after the Gentiles had receiued the faith; as appeareth by
the dispersion of the Iewes among them. Therefore was
the Syrian Interpreter much deceiued, who ascribeth this
Epistle to that Iames, before whome our Sauiour was transfigured
in the mount. For he was the brother ofMat. 17. 1. Iohn,
and so the sonne of Zebede, as it is manifest from the
Scriptures.
            The Authoritie,The Authoritie. and Authentitie of this Epistle hath bin

The Occasion that mooued the Apostle to write,The Occasion. was not
theTest. Rhem. arg. in epist lae. 
               error of onely faith vnto iustification, as the Rhemists
would implie out of S. Augustine. ForFulke Ibid. 
               The error of onely
faith, against which S. Augustine writeth,De fide, & operibus. was of them
that thought the profession of Christian religion (how
wickedly soeuer a man liued) was sufficient to saluation.
Against which this Epistle, and others were written.
            Indeed there seeme to haue beeneHemin gius. two principall occasions,
that procured this Epistle. The one, the fierie persecution
of the Church, which causeth the ApostleIam. 1. 2. Iam. 5. 9. more
then once to inculcate exhortation vnto patience. The other,
that hypocrisie which raigned in many:Aretius. For there
were many that professed religion, which in word were
Christians; but not in life and manners. Such as Paul prophecied
of,2. Tim. 3. 5. hauing a shew of godlinesse, but denying
the power thereof: like the Church of Sardi,Apoc. 3. 1. who had a
name that she liued, but was dead. For the reformation
of which, this Epistle is thrapped full of exhortations vnto
all good workes.
            The StateThe state. of this Epistle is almost wholly Doctrinall.
Athan. 
               Scripsit eam more & genere docendi: and teacheth in the
manner of Common places. The fift common place (following
that memorable B
                     •
                  za, who hath so well deserued
of the new Testament) is begunne at the 14. verse of this
second Chapter. There the Apostle entreth into discourse
what manner of faith that is, by which a man is saued, and
sheweth that it is neither an hypocriticall profession, and
ostentation of faith, where it is not in truth; no nor euery
kind of true faith, which is saith indeed, that is able to
iustifie a man before God: but onely such a kind of true
faith, as is fruitfull in good workes. This doctrine the Apostle
first proposeth by way of Question,Iam 2. 14. 
               What auaileth
it, my brethr
                     •
                  n, if a man say hee hath faith, when hee hath no
workes, can the faith saue him? that is, can such a kinde of
faith saue him? As if hee should say; No: such a faith as



hath no workes, cannot saue a man, Secondly, he openeth
and illustrateth the truth of this proposition, by a familiar
similitude.15. 
               For if a brother or sister be naked and destitute
of daily foode,
               16. 
               And one of you say vnto them, depart in peace,
warme your selues, and fill your bellies, notwithstanding you
giue not them those things which are needefull to the bodie:
what helpeth it?
               17. 
               Euen so the faith, if it haue no workes, is
dead of it selfe. The meaning is: Euen as good and charitable
words profit not a poore man, if we doe not indeede
releiue him; so speaking of faith, and professing
of faith, will not saue a man, vnlesse his deedes declare that
hee hath saith indeed. Thirdly, he bringeth in a true beleeuer,
whose faith is fruitfull, chalenging as it were an
hypocriticall professor of faith to declare it by his workes;
Shew mee thy faith by thy workes,
               18. 
               and I will shew thee my faith
by my workes. As if he should say; I haue faith, and I declare
it by my deedes: if thou hast faith (as thou braggest)
shew it by thy deedes also. Fourthly, he sheweth by instance
and example, that not the shew of faith, no nor euery
kind of true faith is able to saue and iustifie before
God: As to beleeue that there is a God, that there is but
one God, that this God is mercifull, iust, &c. no, not to
beleeue all that to be true which is written of God in the
Scriptures, is sufficient to saluation. For so much the very
Deuills of hell beleeue, and yet are in no comfort, nor hope
of fauour. And this hee laieth downe in the 19. verse:
Thou beleeuest that there is one God,
               19. 
               thou doest well: the Deuills
also beleeue, it, and tremble. As if he should say; In beleeuing
so much thou doest well: for that is true, and
ought to be beleeued: but this is not inough, nor sufficient.
If it were, then the Deuills might be saued; for they
beleeue so much as well as thou. But they beleeue that, and
yet tremble, so thou m
                  •
               iest beleeue as much, and yet be
damned. And thus I am come to the words of my Text,
The Deuills beleeue, and tremble.
            
            
               
The words are a plaine and full proposition, consisting

meane not to speake at large, though it offereth iust occasion
to intreat of the names, of the nature, of the quaelities,
and of the number of Deuills: of which points also I haue
had many meditations: But by discoursing of them, I
should not attaine to the principall ende of my thoughts.
I will therefore deliuer onely so much of them, as maketh
to the opening of the Text, and that euen in three words;
and so proceede to that which followeth.

               ) It is necessarie that we vnderstand what
kinde of persons or creatures the Apostle intendeth in this
word:
               1. Subiectum. and the more, because the word is 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , and
hath beene vsed in diuers significations. Therefore thus I
vnfold it:

                  •
               ts sweet as the filberd: and
yet Dodoneus saith of it, that it is good for nothing. I would
therefore intreat and perswade all young Diuines, to beginne
their race with trauersing the worthie writings of
Luther, Melancthon, Calvin, Beza, Zanchius, Musculus, and
the like, (bookes some thirtie or fourtie yeares agoe in the
onely request) and of them to take their chiefe repast: vsing
only the other like sweet meats after a feast, rather to close
the stomacke, and to delight with varietie, then to satisfie
the appetite, or to support nature. For my part, I refuse not
wholly to vse them, as will appeare by this Treatise: but in
many cases, (as namely in this of the Deuills beleeuing,) I
hold both their Obiections and Solutions so needeles and friuolous,
as I doe not vouchsafe them so much as a bare relation.
This may suffice the bodie of this Auditorie; that the
Apostle here affirmeth, and reason from the Scriptures confirmeth
the same, that there is faith and beleefe, euen in the
Deuills.
            
            Secondly, this sheweth that the very Deuils of hell haue
some thing in them that is good. For they beleeue. Now
true and right beleefe, is of it selfe the good gift of God.
Indeed the Deuills as bad as they are, haue in them many
good parts, For 1. their naturall substance is good: it is
the creature of God, andGen. 1. 31▪
                
               all that God made, was exceeding

is good. As when they professedMatth. 8.

                   est:
that is, yet in both of them it was not false, but true; not
to be denied, but to be acknowledged; not to be detested,
but approoued. Yea, and lastly, the very drift of S. Iames
in this place implieth that the faith in the Deuills is good,
and right, and true. For hee will prooue that an imaginarie,
titularie, and pretensed faith, cannot saue; by an argument
à maiori: for so much as there is some kind of faith,
which is true, and right in it selfe, and yet that will not
bring to saluation; which he instanceth presently by that
faith which is in the Deuills, as hath beene before declared.
            Now that we may applie all this to our vse. As it is with
the Deuils, so is it in this case with all Deuillish men. No
man so wicked, nor so very a Deuil incarnate, but that besides
the common gifts of nature, as strength, shape,
limmes, sence, reason, and such like, (which all are good
parts in themselues) hee hath also many times,Insti

righteous, but goe no further then the wicked: good parts
they may haue, so hath the Deuill, yet good men they are



not, nor in more assurance of saluation then are the damned
deuils of hell. And all this must teach vs, not to content
our selues with ordinarie gifts of nature, which are
common with vs, to the deuills; no nor with some extraordinarie
grace, by which euen wicked men are sometimes
fitted to particular workes, or speciall callings. But let vs
labour to turne truly vnto God by repentance, which the
deuills can not doe: to be engrafted into Christ by faith,
which the deuils cannot be: and to possesse the spirit of
sanctification, which the deuils cannot haue. So shall we
resemble the blessed Angels in goodnes, and be partakers
of their glorie in the heauens.
            3. The Deuils beleeue. What? that there is one God. So
S. Iames saith in this place: and much more they beleeue, as
hath beene before declared. A notable Item for Atheists,
which neither beleeue there is a God, nor a Christ, nor a
Deuill, nor an hell, nor an heauen, nor any thing else belonging
to deuout religion.Psal. 14. 1. 
               The foole hath said in his heart,
there is no God. O damned crue of cursed men; worse in

A reuerend and auncient Preacher, who liued, and



died not long since in this honourable Citie, a man whose
goodnesse, and conscience I well knew to be such, as hee
would commit willingly no fable vnto writing, reporteth
this historie of an Atheist in England:

                  . A young man a
Papist not satisfied with the course of life which he found
among men of that religion; declined from them to the
Protestants. Not contented with their conuersation neither,
he diuerted from them to the Familists. There hee
rested himselfe, and found satisfaction. The first principle
which they taught him, was this, that there was no God. As
indeed the villanies and abhominations of the Familists
beeing such, as are reported, they had need feare vp their
consciences, before they attempt them, and da
                  •
               me vp their
naturall light, perswading themselues that there is no God
to see them, nor Iustice in God to be auenged of them:
well: this youth vpon this perswasion, fell to a loose life,
and at length stole an horse, for which he was apprehended,
conuicted, condemned, and ledde to execution: when
hee was readie to be turned off, hee desired the ladder to
be staied, and vttered these words: Well, say all what they
will, surely there is a God: and this God is louing to his freinds,
and terrible to his enemies. Now turne mee off. O invincible
testimonie of conscience, and ô the mightie hand of the
highest God! that is able to draw forth testimonie to
himselfe from his most professed enemies. When Seneca
disswaded Nero from his villanie, and exhorted him so to
deale, and so to carrie himselfe,
                  
                     〈…〉
                   2. 
               vt facta superi semper comprobent
sua; that the Gods aboue might approoue and
accept his doings: Nero answered like a dogged Atheist;
stulte, verebor esse cum faciam Deos? doting Philosopher,
(quoth hee) when I goe about mine odious designes (the
polluting of my selfe, the defiling of my kinred, the ripping
of my mother, the murdering of my nobles, the fiering
of my imperiall Citie, &c.) shall I then stand fearing
or imagining that there are any Gods? And what shall we



say to hainous malefactours, that attempt, and effect robberies,
slaughters, poisonings, murdering of Kings, blowing
vp of Parliaments, supplanting of Christian states, (in
which kinds our bloodie Papists of late yeares haue excelled:)
doe they not say for the time with Nero, verebor esse
cum faciam Deos? If they did not: a man would wonder
that the very remembrance of the name of God should not
terrifie them from so heighnous impietie. I conclude this
point with that of Augustine,
               
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                
               Vinam sicut daemones iudicem,
sic homines agnoscerent saluatorem: My praier shall be
for this godlesse crue, that as the Deuills acknowledge
Christ for their Iudge, so God would vouchsafe to turne
their hearts, that they may acknowledge him, and embrace
him for their Sauiour.
            
            Hitherto I haue spoken of the Deuills faith, now it followeth
to speake of their feare. The Apostle here saith,
that They tremble.

of armour in the battell; and some other things too
long, and not very needefull to rehearse. The word seemeth
to implie an extreame feare, which causeth not onely
trembling, but also a roating, or shriking out. As those
are woont to doe that are in extremitie of this affection.

            And if any man will obiect against this, that the deuills
bewaried no such extremitie of feare; because an other
Euangelist saith,Muk. 56.

but for feare of greater punishment. As a false hearted
Papist may crouch, and creepe, and doppe like a Frier,
before the Worthy King of great Brittaine, not of any
loue to his person, or honour to his estate, but for feare of
his sword, and the iustice of his Lawes: The deuills therefore
notwithstanding all this, quaked like Aspen leaues at
the presence of Christ.
            From hence arise many lessons of instruction. As.
            1. The Deuills are euer trembling before God: it followeth
by necessary consequence, that they can carrie no loiall
affections, not louing deuotions towards God. For, Quem
metuunt, oderunt. And as Tertullian spake the very same,

that daily feareth the rodde, the seruant that hourely
feareth the whippe, neither of them can beare true or hartie
loue vnto their master. Therefore is the Deuill rightly
calledMatth. 13. 28.

the Church, are continually opposed of the deuill, and his
ministers. Hereof he is calledIo

raigneth in him: A wicked man led by the spirit of Satan,
would doe more harme if he durst, to satisfie his corrupt
affections; a good man led by the spirit of God, would
doe more good if he could, to please and honour his heauenly
Father: But feare restraineth the one, and loue inciteth
the other.

               Duo sunt timores Domini,
seruilis, & amicalis: There are two sorts or kinds of the
feare or the Lord. The one, a seruile feare; as when the
slaue or bondman feareth the masters whippe. The other,
a freindlike, or filial feare, as when a dutifull sonne feareth
to greeue and offend a louing father. The Deuills feare and



tremble: but how?Lyra. in Iac. 1. 
               contremiscunt timore paenorum: They
tremble only for feare of punishment, that God wil plague
them for their sinnes. The children of God feare also, but

least they offend him whom they loue, and so he depart
from them. S. Augustine sheweth this difference by the similitude
of two married wiues, the one a chast spouse, the
other a common strumpet. Both of them feare their husbands,
but in a diuerse manner, and in a sundrie respect.
August. tract 9 in epist. Io
                     •
                  an. & epist. 121 ad Honorat. The harlot she saith, timeo virum ne veniat: I feare my
husband least hee come, and take me in my naughtinesse.
The chast Matrone, she saith; timeo virum ne discedat: I
feare my husband, least for my misdemeanour, he should
depart from mee. The harlot she saith, timeo virum ne damnet:
I feare my husband least he punish me for mine adulterie.
The chast matrone she saith, timeo virum ne deserat:
I feare my husband least he forsake me for mine vndutifulnesse.
Both doe feare: but the one with a hatred of her
husband, from whom she expecteth punishment: the other
with a loue of her husband, of whom she is loath to be
forsaken. So standeth the case betweene the Deuills, and
the Saints: They feare God so, as that withall they hate him
in their hearts, knowing that he will be and shall be their
confounder. These feare God so, as withall they loue him
in their hearts, as feeling that he is, and beleeuing that he
will be their carefull preseruer. And if at any time mistrustfull,
or carnall feare doe take hold vpon the Saints, yet it is
neither totall, nor finall, as it is in the Deuills. For the regenerate
partie will euer cleaue to Gods mercie by faith;
and the spirit of adoption will at length get the victorie,
and make themRom. 12. 15. crie with comfort, Abba, Father: whereas
the Deuills feare euer totally, without one droppe of faith,
and finally without one moment of comfort. Therefore
as it is no comfort to the Deuills, to know that the Saints
doe feare as well as they: so it need be no discomfort to



the Saints, to see that they feare as well as the deuills. M

with which we please God; the fruit whereof is euerlasting
saluation.
            Hitherto I haue spoken of the Deuills beleefe and trembling
seuerally and asunder: and deriued vses from either
necessarie to our instruction. Now consider we of them
iointly and together. They beleeue, and yet they tremble.
They tremble, and yet they beleeue. What? Pugnantia loqueris
Iacobe? Good S. Iames, doest thou not speake contraries?
How will these two stand together, beleeuing and
trembling? If they beleeue, why doe they tremble? If they
tremble, how doe they beleeue? for on the one side,Basil. in Psal. 33. 
               timor
hostilis infidelitatis filius: hostile feare is the ofspring of infidelitie.
Why were the Apostles 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , because they were

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               :Matth 8. 26. 
               Why are yee fearefull, O yee of little faith? If
therefore the deuills tremble, it is a signe that they beleeue
not. On the other side, if they beleeue, then what need
they tremble? For first: Faith maketh attonment with
God:Rom. 5. 1. 
               Beeing iustified by faith, we haue peace toward God. If
they be at peace with God, what cause haue they to feare?
For,Rom 8. 31. 
               If God be on our side, who can be against vs? Secondly,
Act 15 9. 
               Faith purifieth the heart. Now if the Deuills be mundi corde:
thenMatt. 5. 8. 
               they are blessed, and see God with comfort. What
then need they feare? Thirdly, faith giueth boldnes and
confidence:Ephes. 3. 12. 
               By whom we haue boldnesse and entrance with
confidence by saith in him. Boldnes and Confidence are
plaine opposites to feare and trembling. Fourthly, faith
               Gal. 5. 6. 
               worketh by loue. Now1. Io

gracefull crowne, vpon thy head▪ and a chaine of gold about

of grace vpon their heads, and such a rich coller of Sss
about their necke as faith is; a man would think they were

               ie

How then, saith S. Iames here, that they beleeue, & yet
they tremble. The answer is this: The deuills beleeue much &
many things, as hath bin before declared, but yet they beleeue
not that which should keepe them from trembling.
What is that? M. Bucer setteth downe in three words:

               Reconciliationem non credunt: They beleeue no atonement
or reconciliation, made or to be made between them
and Almightie God. Therefore all that which they beleeue,
will not keepe them from trembling. Take for an example
of them in this case, a malefactor, a felon, a murderer
or traytour conuicted and condemned to death. This
malefactor knoweth the King, who he is: he knoweth his
prerogatiue royall, that he can, and is able to pardon him;
he knoweth and beleeueth further, that the King of his naturall
disposition is mild, kind, bounteous, piti
                  •
               ull, mercifull,
(as thanked be God, our King Iames is at this day.) The
same malefactor knoweth yet further, that the King out of
his royall bountie and grace, hath pardoned many, yea
some capitall offendors. But now withall, he hath no



meanes, nor friend to make to the King to obtaine his pardon:
he hath neither word, not writing from the King, to
warrant his pardon: nay he hath no hope, that if he sought
for it, the King would graunt his pardon; nay his heart is
so besotted, as that he can not thinke of seeking a pardon.
Here all the knowledge of the King, of the Kings mercie,
of the Kings mercifull dealing with others, will not put
him out of feare of death; but he trembleth daily & hourely
expecting his execution. So is it with the Deuill. He
knoweth God, be knoweth the omnipotent power of
God, that God can forgiue him, and he can say with the
leper,Mat. 8.

this the Deuill knoweth well, and beleeueth all that he
knoweth, as hath beene before declared. But now the
wretched fiend hath neither means to make for his pardon
(for Christ is but1. Tim. 2. 5. Mediator dei & hominum, a Mediator
betweene God and man, not betweene God and the deuills;
and the goodnes of God, which appeared in Christ,

               , not 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , a loue of men, not a
loue of deuills) neither hath he one title or iotte of a promise
from God, that he shall be pardoned, neither hath he
the hope that if he begge it, God will giue him pardon,
neither hath he an affection to desire pardon, but is shut vp
(as areRom. 2. 3. all reprobates) 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , vnto a heart
that knoweth not how to repent. Therefore for all his beleefe,


               
he trembleth for feare, in the expectation of eternall torments.
Againe, take another example of this: A man is
deepely indebted, & non est solvendo, he hath not to pay:
he heareth, he knoweth, he beleeueth, that his Creditour
is a verie honest and mercifull man; that he hath dealt very
honestly and mercifully with others, giuing day to some,
remitting to others a third part, a halfe part, yea to some
the whole debt. But he hath neither promise from his creditor,
nor perswasion in himselfe, that he will deale so patiently
and bountifully with him. In this case all the knowledge
that he hath of his creditors gentlenesse towards others,
will no whit satisfie his minde, but he will feare daily
to be vnder arrest, and to kisse the goale. Now thus standeth
the case betwixt God and the Deuill: Hee is runne
deepely into debt by his sinnes, (for sinnes are 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ,

for which we are subiect to conuention, and conuiction,
and exaction, as Tertullian speaketh, euen as one
man is for debt vnto another:) He knoweth that God many
times dealeth with men, as the kind householder with
his beggerly seruant,Mat. 18. 27. who when he had nothing to pay,
his Master forgaue him all. But now he hath neither promise
from God, not beleefe in himselfe that those debts
shall be remitted vnto him, therefore he liueth dayly vnder
feare to bee cast into prison, euen into hell fire, from
which he shall not be deliuered till he hath paid the vtmost
farthing. And hence it is that not beleeuing mercie
from God, though he beleeue a great deale more then hundred
thousands doe; yet he is not at peace with himselfe
in his owne heart, but (as S. Iames saith here) doth beleeue,
and tremble.
            
            And here now commeth fitly to be examined and discussed
the true and essentiall difference between the dead
vnprofitable faith of the deuills, which will not keepe them
from trembling: and the liuely sauing faith of the Elect (as



theTit. 1. 
                     •
                  . Apostle calleth it) which causeth their saluation.
            Some conceiue the difference to be this: that Alia est
vera, alia ficta fides: The faith of the Saints they say is, a
true faith; the faith of the deuills a false, or faigned faith.
Absurd; for we haue heard before out of S. Augustine, that
De vnic. baptism. c. 10. the deuills faith was as true a faith as Peters. And certen
it is, that if they haue any faith, that must needes be true:
For, quicquid est, verè est. And that faigned faith which
they gather out of the Apostle,1. Tim 4. 5. 2. Tim 1. 5. 
               fide non ficta, is none otherwise
to be called faith, then 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , by way of
likelihood or similitude, because it beareth some resemblance
of faith: As a king in a play is called a king, and
the image of a man, is called a man, when indeede and
truth, they are neither so, nor so. Therefore when Harding
affirmeth, thatDefence of the Apolog. part. 2. cap. 20. 
                     〈◊〉
                  . 1. 
               A true faith may be idle, and vtterly
without good workes: this is certainly true of some kind of
faith, which notwithstanding is faith indeede, as we see in
the Reprobate, yea and in the deuills. And when the reuerend
Bishop the peerelesse Iewel of his time, replieth that,
The faith of the deuills indeede and verily is no faith: this is
euidently false, if it be spoken generally of the nature
thereof. But as the intention of controuersie is there betweene
them (for they speake of a profitable and liuely
faith:) So Harding lieth in his throat, (for a true faith can
not be idle) and Bishop Iewels position is most vndoubtedly
true, The faith of Deuills (in this sense) is no faith at
all, that is, no sauing or iustifying faith, as after shall appeare.
And this I thought good to note, least either any School-Papist
should thinke to finde aduantage in that worthie
mans doctrine, or that I in this opinion doe dissent from
so Reuerend a Diuine. But to returne to the purpose.
            Others make this the difference between the faith of the
Deuills, and the faith of the Elect: that the one is informis,
and the other formata. They say, that the faith of the
deuills is without forme, because it wanteth loue: the faith


               
of the Saints is perfected and formed, for it worketh by
loue. A common distinction among the Schoolemen; and

the Deuills hath the same forme, that hath the faith of the
Elect, or some other forme at least it must haue to make it
Habituall, and without a forme it cannot exist.
            There be others yet, that make this the difference betweene
them. They say, that the one is Extorta, or Coacta:
the other is Voluntaria. The deuills faith (say they) isBel. de iusti

faith of men (euen of euill men) is free and voluntarie.N. Gorran in 2. Thes. 3. 
               Nos
enim non credimus contremiscentes id est, inuiti & coacti, sed
sponte & libenter: For we beleeue not trembling (saith
Bellarmine) that is, against our wills, and by compulsion,
as doe the Deuills; but willingly, and of our owne accord.
Marke by the way, how learnedly the great Clarke expoundeth
S. Iames: The Deuills beleeue trembling, that is,
(saith blind Bellarmine) by compulsion. But let him goe.
This distinction of faith voluntarie, and compelled, hath (I
confesse) somewhat more in it then the former. For it may



be, that is true of Thomas Aquines,

signes of faith are so euident, as they are compelled to beleeue
whither they will or no. But if I may be bold to interpose
my opinion herein (reseruing the iudgement therof
vnto the learned) I hold, that the faith of the Elect is as
much compelled, as the faith of the Deuills, and the faith
of the Deuills is as voluntarie (for that which they doe beleeue)
as is the faith of the Elect. For, as they are compelled
to beleeue, euidentia signorum, by the euidence of things;
so are we compelled to beleeue, euidentiâ Spiritus, by the euidence
of the Spirit: the holy Ghost vrging, pressing, opening,
and altering our vnbeleeuing heart, and drawing
vs euen against nature (as it were against the haire) to the
obedience of faith: yea no man can obey the Spirit herein,
but he offereth violence (as it were) to himselfe, and to his
owne carnall and vnbeleeuing soule. On the other side,
when they or we doe come to beleeue, whither they by
sence, or we by instinct, certainely the faith it selfe must
needes be voluntarie. For,D

among men, & how the Deuills should beleeue against their



will, (though it be against their liking) my reason doth not
conceiue.
            But of these false distinctions and differences betweene
the faith of the Deuills, and the faith of the Elect, inough,
if not too much. Yet yee know that error must be remooued
out of the way, if we will make cleere passage for
truth: as weeds must be pulled vp, that the corne may
growful.Naz sent. lambi
                     •
                  . 
               Omnis error in vitio est, saith Nazianzene: Euery
error is a fault, and so would be corrected.
            Now come we to describe the true differences of these
two faiths: and so in a few words lightsomely to open all
that Saint Iames speaketh in this Chapter of a dead faith
without workes, which can not saue a man; and yet no
whit therein crossing S. Paul, who in his two worthie
Epistles to the Romanes and Galathians, teacheth and
prooueth, that Only faith sufficeth to saluation. Thus therfore
I proceed.
            The Faith of the Elect apprehendeth (as many other
things) so namely and particularly, The mercie and loue of
God the Father, per Deum mediatorem, by Christ the Mediator.
Finding, and feeling that God loueth him, he in naturall
affection turneth to God to loue him againe. For, gratia
gratiam parit: Louing God againe, he laboureth to
serue, and honour that God, who hath loued him first: and
that by doing his will and commandements. Hereof he
bringeth forth good works, to the glorie of God, and the
benefit of his Church. And thusGal. 5. 6. 
               faith worketh by loue:
that is, of loue, it is fruitfull in good works.Greg. hom 12. lib. 3. in Ezech. 40. 47. 
               Quantum
credimus, tantum amamus, & quantum amamus, tantum de
spe praesumimus. Quis
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   enim fidelis, tantum credit, quantum
sperat & amat, & tantum operatur quantum credit, & sperat,
& amat. And this is that which we call fides viua, a liuing,
or a liuely faith; because it sheweth the power and life of
it selfe by operation, as a tree sheweth it selfe to liue by
the leaues, blossomes, and fruit which it bringeth forth.



And of this faith is all S. Pauls treatie, when he maketh it
the hand or instrument of our Saluation. On the otherside,
the faith of deuills apprehendeth many things, as hath
beene before declared; but among all, it apprehendeth
not, nor can apprehend no mercie, fauour, loue, or pardon
from God, as from a Father: but all Iustice and seueritie, as
from an angrie and offended iudge. Not beleeuing that God
loueth them, they haue no inclination to loue God againe.
Louing him not, they haue no care to honour him: not seeking
his honour, they are not carefull to please him by
performing any dutie to him, or his people. And this is
that same fides mortua, of whichIam. 2. 17. 
               S. Iames intreateth in
this chapter, and is so called, because it bringeth forth no
more fruit, then a dead blocke or rotten tree, nor will it
saue a man, no more then it will the deuills. Of whome the
Apostle notwithstanding all that their faith, professeth
here that they tremble in the presence of God. This I take
to be the true, naturall, and essentiall difference betweene
the faith of the Deuills, and the faith of the Saints.
            
            And here now my shippe must passe between two dangerous
rocks; the bodies whereof though they be cliuen
asunder, yet the feete and foundation ioyne both together.
The good breath of the Spirit of God blow vpon my
sailes, and the holy wisdome of God set steersman at my
helme, that I may discouer both, and auoid both, and saile
euen betweene both: and so arriue happily in the hauen
of truth, with the safetie of my selfe, and of my hearers.
            There are at this day two dangerous opinions about
our Sauing faith. The one, is the doctrine of our English
Libertines, which of my knowledge are neither few in
number, nor small in account. And these men doe not
onely professe themselues, but also teach to others, that to
beleeue the starie of Christ, and what the Scripture hath written
of Christ, is all-sufficient to Saluation. God (they say)
requireth no further faith at our hands. And these I call



my bare Historians. The other is, the doctrine of them of
the Church of Rome, who seclude confidence in the mercie
of God, from the nature of Iustifying faith. Lindane saith,
Epih. doct. cuangel. 
               Fides illa, quâ quis firmiter credit, & ceriò statuit propter
Christum sibi remissa peccata, se
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   possessurum vitam aternam,
non fides est, sed temeritas: That saith, by which a man assuredly
beleeueth, & certainly concludeth, that his sinnes
are forgiuen for Christs sake, and that he shall inherit euerlasting
life;Bella Arma Minae is indeede not faith, but rashnes. Bellarmine,
whose very name breatheth out nothing but wrath, can
not abide in this ca
                  •
               e to heare of mereie. He hath many
chapters to prooueDe iust l. 1. c. 6, 8, 9, 10, 11. by the Scriptures, by the tradition of
the Church, by reason, &c. that Iustifying faith hath not for
his obiect, the speciall mercie of God: yea, and he saith plainly,
that The Catholiques doe affirme,Ibid. c. 4. 
               certam promissionem
specialis misericordiae, non tam ad fidem, quam ad praesumptionem
pertinere; that a certaine promise of speciall mercie,
belongeth not so much to faith, as to presumption. Thus,
for a Christian to professe by faith assurance of his owne
saluation, is among our Pseudo-Catholiques, no better then
headie rashnes, and haughtie presumption.

any man shall say, that iustifying faith is nothing els, but a
confidence in the mercie of God, forgiuing sinnes for



Christs sake, or that this confidence, or assurance, is alone
that faith by which we are iustified, let him be accursed.
In this determination (I say) they hit not the bird in the
eye, nor crosse not the Doctrine taught by the Protestants.
We are not in the heresie of Apelles, which saide,Eushist l. 5. c. 13 a man
might hold what faith he would otherwise: eos enim, qui in
Christum crucifixum spem coniecissent, saluos fore, &c. so as
they reposed their hope in Christ crucified: for then they
should be saued. We doe not say, as they suppose; that a
iustifying faith is nothing els but an assurance of mercie: or,
that this assurance alone, ioyned with nothing els doth iustifie.
No: we say thatBucan. loc. 19. de fide c. 5.

veritati Dei subscribere, quoties, & quicquid, & quocunque

often soeuer, whatsoeuer, and in what manner soeuer he

               proprium & principale, primum
& proximum obiectum fidei iustificantis, the proper and
principall, the chiefe and neerest obiect of iustifying faith,
is (among all other things which it apprehendeth) Christ
crucified, with all his benefits, as he is offered vnto vs in
the Word and Sacraments; and in Christ and through
Christ the mercie of God the Father. We say further, for
the opening of this matter, that whereas there areMusc. loe. com de fide. 
               tres
partes fidei, (as Musculus calleth them) three parts, or three
degrees, or three saculties, or three acts of a true faith,
Credere Deum, Deo, In Deum: The one, to beleeue there is
a God: the second, to beleeue all that God saith to be
true: the third, to beleeue in God with confidence: this
same tertius fidei gradus, to trust in God with confidence
of mercie, dothMus. ibid. 
               ex duobus prioribus emergere, arise from
the two former, and as Chemnitius speaketh,Chem. vbi sup.

                     •
                  nit
& includit, presupposeth and includeth the former. For no



man can by faith assure himselfe of the mercie of God, who
doth not first beleeue that there is a God, and that all is
true which proceedeth from him. Therefore doe not we
imagine such a iustifying faith, as beleeueth nothing but
mercie to himselfe: or that beleefe of mercie alone (that is
ioyned with no beleefe els) is sufficient to iustification.
But we say, that a Iustifying faith, hath for his Obiect, all that
God would haue to be beleeued: and among all other
things principally, the mercie of God. I make this plaine
by a similitude. The vegetatiue soule, is the soule of plants,
and is a true soule in his kind, though it hath neither sense
nor reason. The sensitiue soule, is the soule of beasts, and
soules, and fishes, & it is a distinct kind of soule by it selfe;
including vegetation, but void of reason. The reasonable
soule, is the soule of men, & is a distinct kind of soule by it
selfe; yet such a one as includeth both vegetation, and sense.
Applie this to the three kinds, or degrees of faith. Credere
Deum, to beleeue there is a God, is the faith of Infidels and
Pagans, and is a true faith, though it neither beleeue the
Word of God, nor mercie from God. Credere Deo, that is,
to beleeue all that God saith to be true, is the faith of Deuills
and Reprobates, and includeth in it the faith of Infidels,
and is a true faith in the kind, though it apprehend no
mercie. Credere i
                     •
                   Deum; that is, by faith to relie vpon
the mercie of God, is the faith of the Elect, and comprehendeth
both the faith of the Infidels, and the faith of the deuills:
and is a distinct kind of faith in it selfe. And this
compleat faith, consisting of all these three, we Protestants
say, to be that onely faith that iustifieth in the presence of
God.
            
            Against therefore both Historians and Papists, I make
these foure conclusions. 1. True Christian sauing faith, doth
not onely beleeue God and Christ, the word of God, and
the Word of Christ, the storie of God, and the storie of
Christ: but also it doth beleeue and apprehend the mercie


               
of this God, per de
                     •
                  mmediatorem, by Christ the Mediator.
2. True Christian sauing faith, differeth from the faith of
the Deuills, only in this (and the consequences thereof)
that the Elect apprehend the mercie of God to them in
Christ, which the Deuills can not doe. 3. To beleeue only
the Word of God, and the Storie of Christ: is to beleeue
no more then the Deuills. 4. To beleeue all that the Deuills
doe beleeue, and not by faith to applie the mercie of
God to thy selfe in Christ, will 
                  •
               o more keepe thy soule
& conscience from despaire, then it doth the Deuills from
trembling; of which S. Iames saith here, that though they
beleeue, yet they tremble.
            
            Now, that the word of God is cleare in this case, and that
God requireth in the Scriptures, not only the faith of the
storie; but also, by faith, an application of mercie to a mans
owne soule; I will make manifest vnto you by foure principall
 arguments: whereof, The first shall be drawn from
the doctrin of the Gospell, which is the foundation of truth;
and is called in the Scriptures,Rom. 10. 8. 
               verbum fidei, the word of
 faith. The second, from the Sacraments, annexed to this
Doctrine; which are calledRom. 4. 11. 
               sigilla fidei, the seales of faith.
 The third, from the forme of our Creed, which isAug

                  19. de temp. 
               regula
fidei, the rule of faith. The fourth from the definition, or
 description of faith, laid out Heb. 11. 1. Of which their
owne canonized Schooleman (who is among them as an
other Oracle of Delphos) saith, thatTh. Aquin. 1. 2. q 4. art. 1. though some affirme
that it is no perfect definition, because it sheweth not the
quidditie or essence thereof,Metaphis. 7. as the Philosopher speaketh:
yet if a man rightly consider of it, Omnia ex quibus fides potest
definiri in praedicta definitione tanguntur, licet verba non
ordinentur sub forma definitionis: that is, All things required
to the definition of faith are touched therein, though the
words be not placed in a logicall forme of a definition.
Therefore that definition we wil examine in his place. But
first of the doctrine of the Gospell.
            
            
               
1. No man can doubt, but faith is built vpon Doctrine:
forRom. 10. 17. 
               faith is by hearing: viz. of the doctrine which is
taught vnto vs. Now vpon what doctrine hath faith his
foundation? vpon the doctrine of the Law? By no means:
for,Gal. 3. 11. 
               The Law is not of faith. It neither describeth the
faith, nor requireth the faith, by which we are iustified; but
Calv coir. in Gal. 3. 12. 
               rationem iustificandi hominis a fide prorsus alienam habel: it
prescribeth a meanes of iustification cleane contrarie to
faith: that is, obedience and workes of the Law. It is
therefore built vpon the doctrine of the Gospel: faith must
apprehend the Gospel:Marc. 1. 15. 
               Repent, and beleeue the Gospell. Againe,
Marc. 15 15. 16. Goe preach the Gospel to euery creature. Then
it followeth; He that beleeueth (the Gospell) shall be
saued: hee that beleeueth not (the Gospell) shall be damned.
The matter therefore to be beleeued, is the Gospell.
Now, what is the Gospell? A bare Historie only? or a bare
historicall narration of things done and passed? By no
meanes.De spir. sand cap. 15. 
               Euangelium est forma vitae ex resurrectione, saith S.
Basile; The Gospel is a doctrine of a new forme of life,
following vpon our regeneration, or spirituall resurrection.
And S. Augustine, speaking of Philips preaching to
the Eunuch,Act 8. 35. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               :De fide & oper. cap. 9. 
               Hoe est euangelizaro
Christum, non tantum dieere quae sunt eredenda de
Christo, sed etiam quae obseruanda ei qui accedit ad compagem
corporis Christi: This is to preach the Gospel of Christ, or
Christ in the Gospel, not only to teach what things are to
be beleeued concerning Christ, but also what things he
must obserue and practise, which commeth to ioyne himselfe
to the bodie of Christ. The Gospell therefore is a Doctrine
of admonition, of exhortation, of practise, of reformation:
not a narration only. A note which I would not
omit, because if you marke them, either Protestants or Papists
which content themselues with the faith of the historie;
yee shall find little of spirituall death, or resurrection
in them; that is, little mortification of the flesh, or viuification



of the Spirit, by the power of the death and resurrection
of Christ; wherein notwithstanding confifleth
the very vigour and marrow of the doctrine of the Gospel.
But I come nearer to the purpose. What may we call the
Gospell?

                  •
               aith Nazianzene;
The Gospell is the preaching of a new kind or
meanes of saluation: viz. brought into the world by Iesus
Christ, and differing from that olde of Moses:Leuit. 18 5. which
who so doth, shall liue in them▪ The Gospel then preacheth
a new saluation: and to whom preacheth it? to vs.
And must we beleeue the Gospell? Then must we beleeue
this new saluation. Theophylact sheweth a reason why that
which we cal the gospel, is called in the Greek, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               :

would say a Gods spell, or a good spell) or (as the Greeke
etimologie giueth) a message of good newes, because it
telleth vs of things going well on our sides, and prosperously
with vs; that is, of things good and commodious

                   remissionem peccatorum,

relateth vnto vs, the remission of sinnes, righteousnes,
or iustification, our restoring vnto heauen, our adoption
to be the sonnes of God. All this the Gospell telleth vnto
vs; and this I trowe is a great deale more then the narration
of the historie of Christ. But let me adde a little
more out of that Father against our meritorious workemungers;
Nunciat autem, quam facilè ac gratis haec accepimus:

                     que
                   ea ex
nostris acceperimus bonis operibus, sed gratiâ & misericordià
Dei, talia bona consecuti sumus: that is to say, The Gospell
telleth vs withall, how easily and freely we haue receiued
these things, (that is, remission of sinnes, iustification, restitution
to heauen, adoption to be the sonnes of God.)
For it telleth vs, that we haue not obtained these things,



either by our owne industrie, or by our owne good
workes, but by the grace and mercie of God. O comfortable
Gospel: here is a verie Gods spell indeede, here are
glad tidings indeede, here is a doctrine that passeth all
ioy comprehensible with the deepest vnderstanding. But
now gather we this together. Doth the Gospel bring good
tidings to vs of good things that haue betided vs? Are
these good things, remission of sinnes, iustification, and
the rest? Doth the Gospel tell vs that wee haue receiued
these benefits without our labour, and without our merit
freely of the grace of God? And must we beleeue the gospel?
Why then we must beleeue, that these glad tydings
are sent to vs, that remission of sinnes, and saluation is
giuen to vs, that we are saued by mercie without our owne
deserts. Is not this to beleeue more then the storie? Nay,
is not this to take home the Gospel to our selues? Is not
this by faith to beleeue that the saluation which Christ
wrought for man mentioned in the Gospel, no
                     •
                   accepimus,
we haue receiued: No doubt it is, and so without doubt it
must bee. For, if faith be built vpon the doctrine of the
Gospel; then, Qualis causa, talis effectus: such doctrine,
such faith. But the doctrine of the Gospell is a doctrine
of remission of sinnes, of iustification
                  •
                of adoption, of saluation
by Christ vnto vs. Faith therefore must be a faith
of remission of sinnes, of iustification, of adoption, of saluation
by Christ to vs: which I trowe is an applying of
Gods mercie, and Christs merits vnto our selues.
            And here let none obiect vnto me, that a man may beleeue
there are glad tidings in the Gospel; that a man may
beleeue that the Gospel preacheth remission of sinnes and
saluation by Christ, and yet not to apply them to himselfe,
as doe the deuills and thousands of Reprobats: for this indeede
(say I) is to beleeue the storie of the Gospel; but this
is not to beleeue the Gospel. For the Gospel is a doctrine,

               To him that loued
vs, and washed vs from our sinnes in his blood, and made vs
Kings and Priests vnto God: and a thousand like. So that
the Gospell doth not onely preach remission of sinnes, and
saluation vnto men; but it preacheth it with application
vnto the hearers. And therefore to beleeue the Gospel,
is to beleeue it with application, and so to apply and appropriate
the benefits contained in it, vnto thine own selfe
that hearest it. This say I is to beleeue the Gospel. And so
much for the Gospell, which is, The word of faith.
            
            2. Now, as touching the Sacraments, which are The
seales of faith. What manner of faith doe they seale vp,
and confirme in our hearts? Doe they seale vp vnto vs the
truth of the storie? Are they confirmations vnto vs, that

                  •
                but
they seale vp that which is a great deale more consequent
to vs: and that is, The mercie of God, and the benefits of
Christ to belong vnto vs. As for example; In the Sacrament



of baptisme, there is first water; which Pindarus said
was,Pind initio Oly

of the blood of Christ; which Peter calleth,

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , pretious blood: for the inestimable effects.
Secondly, there is the vnseparable proprietie of water,
which is to wash and cleanse: a representatiō of the power
and vertue of the blood of Christ, which1. Ioh. 17. cleanseth
from all sinne. Yea, and thirdly, there is the applying
of this water, vnto the body of the person baptized: a signe
of the appropriating of the blood of Christ, and the vertue
thereof vnto him that doth receiue it. And so baptisme
carrieth with it, not onely a representation of Christs
blood, and the power thereof in generall: but also a particularizing
of them both vnto the person, which is made
partaker of that holy Sacrament. Hereof S. Paul calleth
Baptisme,Gal 3. 27. a putting on of Christ: All ye that are baptised
into Christ, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , haue put on Christ. They haue
put him on as their owne garment vpon their owne backs
to couer their nakednes, to shrowd them from the parching
heat, and from the pinching cold. Hereof againe
it is that Peter saith,1. Pet. 3. 2 1. Be

heauen, the obtaining of the kingdome of heauen, the
grace of adoption. And such a thing is Baptisme, not ex
opere operato, (which the Fathers neuer dreamed of, that
knewe that wicked men also were baptized, as wee haue
heard before out of Augustine) but by representing, yea
exhibiting, yea applying Christ and his graces vnto vs,
and sealing vp to our faith, the exhibition, and the application,
and so the proprietie and benefit thereof. Baptisme
therefore applieth to the receiuer the mercie of God
in Christ Iesus, and the vertue of his blood to remission of
sinnes.
            Then to proceed to the Sacrament of the Lords supper:
there is first Bread and Wine, a representation of the bodie,
and blood of Christ. There are secondly with them,
the naturall qualities of bread and wine: which arePsal 104. 15. to

               Gen. 49. 11. 
               Sanguis vnae, the blood of the grape. A liuely
image of the vigor of the bodie and blood of Christ: of
which himselfe affirmeth,Ioh. 6. 55. 
               My flesh is meate indeede, and
my blood is drinke indeede. Yea: and that, such meate and
such drinke,54. 
               that whosoeuer eateth this flesh, and drinketh this
blood hath eternall life. But all this is Historicall. There is
therefore yet farther in this Sacrament, a giuing of bread,
a taking, and eating of this bread: there is also a giuing of
this wine, a taking, and a drinking of this wine by the
communicants. This Action as it is most liuely, so it is most
significant: it representeth the giuing of the bodie and
blood of Christ to the receiuer; the taking of the bodie
and blood of Christ by the receiuer; the eating on the bodie
of Christ, the drinking on the blood of Christ by the
receiuer. And so assureth our faith, not onely that
Christs bodie was broken, and Christs blood was shedde,
but that it was also broken, and f

sacramental signes thereof are there tendered and reached
out; and so sealeth vp vnto vs our spirituall nourishment
by him vnto euerlasting saluation. Gregorie Nissene speaking
of those words in the Gospell of Iohn,Ioh. 10. 34. 
               There came
out of his side blood and water, maketh them two images of
the two Sacraments:G. N

               Quoniam tum per diuinum baptisma,
tum per sancti sanguinis participationem & vsum, consecrari

baptisme, and by the participation and vse of his holy
blood, we beleeue that we are consecrated to God, and
doe put on vpon vs the diuinitie, that is, the diuine qualities
of God. And he alleadgeth there Chrysostomes monition
vpon the Exposition of those words: Cùm ad horrendum
poculum accsdis, tanquam ab ipso dominico latere bibiturus
accedas: When thou commest to drinke of this fearefull
cuppe in the Sacrament, come as if thou shouldest
there drinke blood, running out of the very side of the
Lord. So applicatiue should be our faith, in communicating
these holy misteries. And indeed in such an applying
maner did our Lord Iesus institute this Sacrament:Luc. 22 19. 
               Take
yee, eate yee: this is my bodie, which is giuen (not for others
only) but for you.
               20. And againe, This cuppe is the new Testament
in my blood, which is shead (not for others only) but
for you. Euery man therefore that taketh these misteries,
must beleeue that Christs bodie was broken, and that
Christs blood was shead for him: which I trow is a great
deale more then to beleeue the storie. S. Bernard hath a
notable saying, expresse to this purpose:Barna

               & hoc designat

And this doth that holy and vndefiled sacrifice of
the altar signifie vnto vs, where we receiue the Lords bodie;
vt ficut videtur illa forma panis in nos intrare, sic nouerimus
per eam, quam in terris habuit conuersationem, ipsum intrarein
nos, ad habitandum in cordibus nostris per fidem: that
euen as in that Sacrament, the forme of bread is seene and



sensibly discerned, to enter into vs and our bodies, so we
might know that Christ himselfe doth enter into vs, according
to that flate which hee had here amongst vs, to
dwell in vs and in our hearts by faith. The name of the Sacrifice
of the Altar, I refuse not. Our right reuerend and
right learned Bishop of Winchester hath abundantly
shewedD Bilson, The difference of Christian subiection, &c. pat. 3. pag. 506. &c. how that tearme was vsed of the Fathers, and
how it may be receiued of vs. The carnall eating of Christ
(if S. Bernard any such) is also notably confuted by the
same man in the same treatise. But this is that I would
prooue, and that pregnantly, from the words of the Father;
that, the Sacrament of the Lords supper, which hee
there calleth, the sacrifice of the Altar, is not only a bare
signe and representation of Christs bodie and blood broken
and shead vpon the Altar of the Crosse: but also that
the receiuing in of the bread and wine into our selues, doe
seale vp vnto vs that doe receiue them, Christs owne entering
into vs, and dwelling within vs, euen in our hearts
by a liuely faith. And hereof it is that we call the Sacraments,
signa exhibitina, signes that doe exhibite, reach
forth, and tender the things which they figure and represent.
And our Church rightly profeffeth of the Sacramēts,

saith Calvin: I nothing doubt but that Christ doth
verily reach out vnto me, and I doe verily receiue his bodie
and blood to become the food and nourishment of my
soule. Such a faith therefore doe the Sacraments seale vp



vnto vs, as doth not only acknowledge al that Christ hath
done to be true; but also doth applie the merits of Christ,
and thorough them the mercie of God vnto euery worthy
receiuer thereof. And so much of the Sacraments, which
are the seales of faith.
            
            3. It followeth to speake of our common forme of
Creede, which is not amisse called, regula fidei, the rule, or
square of our faith. Because it containeth the most principall
points of our Christian religion, to the proportion
whereof other particulars must be reduced. Blind Bellarmine,
(for who so blind as he that will not see?) vseth this
for the first, and as it were principall reason; that iustifying
faith is not confidence of mercie, because thatBellar. de iu

               In symbole
fidei, in the common rule of our faith, many things are
contained which are necessarie to be beleeued, if a man
will be iustified by faith: of the vnitie, of the Trinitie,
of the incarnation, passion, and resurrection of Christ,
&c. De speciali autem misericordia ne verbum quidem, but in
all the Creede, or Creedes, (for hee ioyneth the foure
knowne Creeds together) there is not one word of speciall
mercie. And therefore he there striueth to confute Luther
and Melancthon, that would include the apprehension
of speciall mercie in the Creed: the one, vnder that Article,
I beleeue the holy Catholique Church: the other, vnder that
Article, I beleeue the remission of sinnes. Well: let the controuersie
stand betweene them as it doth: for I will not
meddle with the latter part of the Creed; I will vse a new
argument out of the former part, which concerneth God,
and our beleefe in him. And touching that I say, that not
only particular words, but the whole tenure of our faith,
as we professe it in the Creed▪ doth implie apprehension
of speciall mercie to the professor. Marke how the forme
of the Creed runneth; 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , I beleeue
in God the Father. And, I beleeue in Iesus Christ. And againe,
I beleeue in the holy Ghost: which if we could properly expresse



in our English tongue, and ioyne the preposition to
the Accusatiue case, should signifie thus much; I beleeue
towards God, or into God the Father: I beleeue towards
or into Iesus Christ, and so forth. For, Credo in Deum, is
more essentiall and effectuall, then our language will fully
expresse. And this is no small matter in the eye of the
Papists: for Master Harding holdeth this forme, Credo in
Deum, so authentike and materiall; as that he deeply challengeth
the Church of England for professing their faith
in another forme,Apolog Eccl. Anglicanae.

                  . the vtterance of our faith is strange to
Christian eares, who haue beene accustomed to heare, Credo
in Deum, &c. He saith that, That other forme of words
which we vse, soundeth not so Christian like: I beleeue
there is a God: I beleeue that Iesus Christ is the sonne of
the Father: I beleeue that the holy Ghost is God. He rendreth
this reason of his rebuke; Although this forme of
words (I beleeue there is a God, &c.) doe expresse a right
faith, yet beeing such as may be vttered by the Deuills, and
hath alwaies beene vttered by Heretikes their ministers;
the auncient and holy Fathers haue liked better the old
forme and manner, after which euery Christian man saith;
I beleeue in God, I beleeue in Iesus Christ, I beleeue in
the holy Ghost: for this importeth a signification of faith,
with hope and charitie; that other, of faith only which the
Deuills haue and tremble, as S. Iames saith. Very well
then; Omen accipio: let M. Hardings speach for this time
goe for currant (which notwithstanding the good Bishop
fully answered in that place) let the most auncient &
most authentique forme of professing our Creed be thus;
Credo in Deum, &c. I beleeue in God; I beleeue in Iesus
Christ, &c. The Question is now, what it is, Credere in
Deum, to beleeue in God? Let the Fathers answer. S. Augustine
saith,August. tract. 20. in Ioh. 
               De Apostolis ips
                     •
                  s dicere possumus: credimus



Paulo, sed non credimus in Paulum; Credimus Petro, sed non
credimus in Petrum: We may say of the Apostles themselues,
I beleeue Paul, but I beleeue not in Paul: I beleeue
Peter, but I beleeue not in Peter. But of God we say
both, I beleeue God, and, I beleeue in God. Then belike, to
beleeue God, is one thing, and to beleeue in God, another
thing. What is then to beleeue in God? S. Augustine sheweth
it in the same place, opening those words,Ioh. 6. 
                     •
                  9. 
               This is the
worke of God, that you should beleeue in him whom hee hath
sent. Thus hee saith; Quid est ergo credere in eum? what is
it therefore to beleeue in him? Hee answereth. Credendo
amare, credendo in eum ire, & eius membris incorporari: By
or in beleeuing to loue Christ, by or in beleeuing to goe
to Christ, by or in beleeuing to be incorporated into the
members of Christ: this is to beleeue in Christ. I demand
then; Can any man heartely and soundly loue Christ, who
hath not some perswasion that Christ loueth him? Can
any man with comfort goe towards Christ, who is not aforehand
perswaded, that Christ will looke comfortably
towards him? Can any man be incorporated into the members
of Christ, that doth not by faith entertaine Christ for
his head? If not: then it followeth, that to beleeue in
Christ, implieth an affiance and perswasion of his loue and
mercie. Cyprian hath a treatise, which is censured I confesse,
byP. Martyr. cont. Gardiner, part. 1. obiect. 89. 
               Peter Martyr to be none of his: and his reasons
are somewhat in that behalfe; yet is that Authoritie good
against the Papists; for Constantius there alleadgeth it▪ yea
and it is not nothing to me that our iudicious Fulke

much to my present Text, and this cause,) Deum, &
Deo credunt daemones; sed in illum non credunt, in quem qui

The Deuills beleeue there is a God, and that God is true,
but they beleeue not in God, in whom whosoeuer beleeueth
shall not be confounded, because they put not their
hope or trust in him. This S. Bernard expoundeth to beleeue
in God, and thus he disseuereth it from the beleefe of
the Deuills. I adde the fourth to make vp the messe: Eusebius
Emissenus;

It is one thing to beleeue God, an other thing, to beleeue
in God. And againe, it is one thing, Credere Deum, to
beleeue there is a God; another thing, to beleeue in God.
For the Deuill is found to beleeue that there is a God; but
to beleeue in God none is prooued, but he which hath deuoutly
trusted in him. I conclude then: Is to beleeue in
God, to beleeue and loue him? Is to beleeue in God, to
repose vpon him the confidence of our happinesse? Is to
beleeue in God, to cast our hope vpon him? Lastly, is to
beleeue in God, deuoutly to trust in him? And doth our
creed teach vs to professe our faith thus; I beleeue in God,
I beleeue in Iesus Christ, I beleeue in the holy Ghost? then
let Bellarmine goe and reconcile himselfe to Mr. Harding
his Auncient; who saith, that to beleeue in God, importeth
a signification of faith, with hope, and charitie, and let him
confesse that the creed intendeth such a faith, as apprehendeth
speciall mercie.
            
            
               
I am not ignorant, that this distinction of Credere Deum,
Deo, in Deum, is somewhat disputed against. Peter
Martyr saith, thatP. Ma

                  t. com. in 
                     •
                  . Cor. 10. The holy Scriptures doe not alwayes,
and exactly obserue it, and he alleadgeth these examples:
Exod. 14. 31. The people feared the Lord, and beleeued the Lord, and
his seruant Moses, Credebant in Dominum, & in Mosen: and
againe,Exod. 19. 9. that, The people may beleeue thee for euer, In te
credant: And in the newe Testament,Ioh. 2. 
                     •
                  3. many beleeued in
his name, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               : which notwithstanding is spoken
of an imperfect faith. And Salmeron the great Iesuite
challengeth S. Augustine by name, for vsing the distinction
of Credere Deo, and Credere in Deum, shewing that they
are vsed alike in the Scriptures, yea and then he bringeth
an instance from the forme of our Creede,Sal

old Testament, and the like, ought not in Greeke or Latine
to be translated with the preposition that ruleth an accusatiue
or ablatiue case, but with a Datiue case. And so
Tremelius and Iunius translate it,Exod 14 31. 
               Crediderunt Iehovae, &
Mosi seruo eius. AndExod 19 9. 
               vt tibi fidant in seculum; yea and the
olde translation readeth in the 14. of Exodus, Crediderunt

                  ius. And so in the Chronicles,2. C

translation readeth,Ioh. 
                     •
                   13. 
               Crediderunt in nomine eius, ioyning
the preposition not with an Accusatiue case, but with an
Ablatiue. Secondly, though in the newe Testament, Credere



in Christo, is often taken for the same that Creder
                     •
                   in
Christum, as we know thatGal. 2 16. A man is not iustified by the
workes of the Lawe, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , but by the
faith of Iesus Christ: we also haue beleeued in Iesus Christ,

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               : yet often also they are taken differently,
and so doe minister iust occasion of distinction in
the deliuerie of doctrine fit for the seuerall places. As for
example; In the 14. of Iohn, within the compasse of three
verses, there is a manifest difference of these three titles:
Credere Christum, Credere Christo, Credere in Christum: As
thus;Ioh. 14. 10. 
               Dost thou not beleeue that I am in the Father, and the
Father in me? He speaketh of a beleefe what Christ is. Then
in the next v. Beleeue me that I am in the Father,
               11. 
               and the father
in me: that is, Beleeue that I speake truth therein. It
followeth immediately,12. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               : He that beleeueth
in me, (that is, with confidence) the workes that I doe, hee
shall doe, and greater also. He therefore that will rightly expound
these 3. verses, must of necessitie intertaine this
threefold distinction. Thirdly, the Iesuites Argument
is like the Logique, and other Popish learning of their
Schooles. Is not the distinction good betweene Credere
Deo, and Credere in Deum, because that many professe in
the Creede, I beleeue in God, which haue no charitie?
Why? The Creede giueth no
                  •
                faith: that isIoh. 6. 
                     •
                  9. 
               the worke of
God. But the Creede teacheth what true faith is, and how
we should professe it. And if any man will in the Creede
professe that he doth beleeue in God, when as he doth only
beleeue a God, or beleeue God to say true: this is but
the hypocrisie or vnbeleefe of the professor, not a defect
of the profession. For the sauing profession of faith is beleefe
in God, with hope of mercie. And that the very lesuite
himselfe confesseth in the selfe same place;Salmeron vbi supra. tom. 6. tract. 8. 
               Credere
in deum est fidei per spem, & dilectionem operantis: to beleeue
in God, is such a faith (or the fruit of such a faith) as worketh
by hope and loue, which is as much as all that I haue



spoken of faith about the Creede. Fourthly, and lastly, say
that S. Augustine, and others, had erred in this distinction
(as the Iesuite will) and so I had not soundly built vpon
them; yet let no Papist that braggeth of the Fathers, barke
against the argument: for besides those which I haue alleadged,
I can also bring forthIn Gal.

cheife of them all. Therefore doth the Creede professe an
exact and compleat faith, which farre exceedeth the faith
of the Deuills, which is the purpose that I propound in this
place. So much therefore of our Creede.
            
            4. It remaineth now that I discusse, that definition or
description of faith, which the Apostle giueth in the Epistle
to the Hebrewes: and that I doe from thence prooue
also, that Iustifying and sauing faith applyeth to the beleeuer
the fauour of God in Iesus Christ. The definition is this:
Heb. 11 1. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               : Faith is the ground of things
that are hoped for. The word 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , (as Schollers knowe)
is deriued of 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , persuadeor, and so of the praeter perfect
tense 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , persuasus sum, I am perswaded. And
fitly: for as Peter Martyr saith well,P Martyr 
                     •
                  n 
                     〈◊〉

any thing, but that whereof we are most fully perswaded.

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                is deriued, protesteth without doubting in the same
case;Rom

nor Angels, nor principallities, nor powers, nor things present,
nor things to come, shall be able to separate vs from the loue of
God, which is in Iesus Christ our Lord. Yea, and our Alexander

               : now this 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               
is somewhat diuersly translated. But the old translation,
which they must not refuse, tearmeth it, substantia, Faith
is the substance of things which wee hope for. The Substance:
how is that? How is faith the substance of those things?
Heare one of their owne, who is no small man among
them. For Abbote Tritenhemius writeth of him that hee
was, nobiliter eruditus, a noble or notable learned man: It
is Nicolaus de Gorran, and what saith hee?N. Gorr. in Heb. 11. Faith is the
substance, id est causa, subsistendi in nobis res sperandas scilicet
bona futura: that is, it is the cause, or meanes, or instrument,
that the things which we hope for, that is to say,
the good things to come, haue an essence, or beeing, or
subsistence in vs. But how that? Et hoc vel in futuro, quod
faciet in nobis subsistere res sperandas in patria per apertam visionem:
vel in praesenti, quod iam facit eas in nobis subsistere
per spem & expectationem: that is to say, Faith giueth a beeing
or subsistence in vs of those things which wee hope
for, either in this life, or in the life to come. In the life to



come, it will giue vs existence of them, per ap
                     •

                     •
                  
                  nem,
then we shall openly see them, yea really possesse them
by the benefit of this faith. In this present life, it giueth
an existence of them also: for euen now faith causeth a
subsistance of them in vs by hope and expectation. Is it so?
doth faith euen while we liue here giue a certen kind of being
to those things in our hearts, the fruition whereof we
afterward expect? And what are those things, which hereafter
we expect? A ioyfull resurrection, discharge in the
day of iudgement, the comfortable beholding of God,
the fruition of his glorious and euerlasting kingdome.
Why then faith giueth a present existence of these things
vnto vs: which it cannot giue without the assurance of the
mercie of God.
            
            But looke we a little from this old to some new translation.
Hemingius turneth it thus;Heb. 11. 1. 
               Fides est fiducia rerum
sperandarum: faith is the confidence of things that are hoped
for. And in his Commentaries vpon this text, hee alledgeth
places out of very approoued Authors, Polybius
and Herodotus; where the word hypostasis is so taken: yea
in the same Epistle is an other place which giueth much
light to this interpretation:Heb. 3 14. For we are made partakers of
Christ, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ,
if we keepe to the ende, initium fiduciae, (so
Calvin readeth it) the beginning of our confidence, that
is, of our faith, which is yet but begunne in vs. Now then,
if faith be turned into fiducia: doe but aske Thomas Aquinas,
what kind of thing fiducia is. He will answer,Th. Aquin. 2. 2 q 129. art 6. 
               Fiducia
est spes futuri auxilij concepta ex dictis aliorum, vel ex his
quae sunt in se vel in alio: Confidence is the hope of future
helpe or aide, conceiued either from other mens words,
or from some thing else which a man hath in himselfe, or
hee knoweth in another. Is Confidence such a thing, and is
faith confidence? why then Faith is a hope of future aide,
or helpe, or good, conceiued from the words or promises



of God; and from somewhat else, which is (not in himselfe,
for in a mans selfe there is no hope of helpe in time to
come, but) in God: as his mercie, his truth, his loue, his
free grace; vpon which indeed our faith is builded, and
groweth vp to full confidence in Iesus Christ. Faith therefore

            Thus I haue finished the foure reasons, which I propounded
to you; fourescoare more might be added,
if it were necessaire. But I stay here, and say with the
Poet,

                  . lib. 1. cap 4. to be an opinion of
Heretikes, wherein they differ from the Catholikes; and
our homebredde Historians haue not shamed to auouch
that it is, The new villainous doctrine of Calvin and Beza, (a
villainous terme to be giuen to so holy, reuerend, & learned
men) therefore omitting what the Protestant Authors
write in this case, I will now shew what my poore reading
hath found about this point in the Ancienter Fathers of the
Church, yea and in such Popish writers, as hauing not
their affections distempered with the heat of contention,
and disputation, haue in a milde and open sort deliuered
their minde herein, as particular occurrances haue occasioned.
            And first to beginne with the Fathers. Irenaeus speaketh
thus of faith;
               
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   l. 2. c. 47. 
               Semper fides quae est ad magistrum nostrum
permanet firma, asseuerans nobis, quoniam solus verè Deus, &
vt diligamus Deum verè semper, quoniam ipse solus Pater: &
speremus subinde plus aliquid accipere, & discere à Deo, quiae
bonus est, & diuitias habens indeterminabiles, & regnum sine
fine, & disciplinans immensam. In effect thus in English: Our
faith which we beare towards our Lord and Master euer
abideth stedfast, telling vs that he is the only true God, &



that we must alwaies heartily loue him, because hee is our
only Father: and that we must hope euer and anon to receiue
more from God, & to learne more of God, because
he is good, and hath riches innumerable, and an endlesse
kingdome, and learning vnmeasurable. I note from hence
3. things. 1. First, faith holdeth vs to the onely true God.
2. Secondly, it holdeth vs to him with loue, as to a louing
Father. 3. Thirdly, it teacheth vs daily to expect from him,
as from a louing father the good which we need both for
life and knowledge. Now if my faith teach me, that God is
my Father, and maketh me to loue him as a Father, and to
expect continually fauours from his hand, as from a good
God & louing Father: tell me if it doth assure my heart of
his loue and mercie?
            
            
               Origen thus:Orig hom. 17. in Gen. 49. 
               Fides quae in Christo est, & praesentis vitae regulam
tenet, & futura spei fiduciam praestat: Faith in Christ
both giueth direction for this life, and yeeldeth assurance
of that which we hope for to be hereafter in the life to
come. Faith therefore assureth vs of that which wee hope
for.
            
            
               Chrysostome thus:Chrys. hom. 36. in Gen. 15. 
               Hoc verae fidei est, quando promissiones
non iuxta solitum morem, & hominibus cognitum fiunt, nos
promissionis virtute fidimus: This is the propertie of true
faith, when God maketh promises after an vnusuall manner,
and such as men are not acquainted with (as he did to
Abraham, Gen. 15. for of that he speaketh in that place)
and we beleeue depending vpon the promise. Faith
therefore taketh hold on Gods mercifull (though extraordinarie)
promises. Againe, the same Father:Chrys. hom. 8. in Rom. 4. 
               Gloriatur
fidelis, non solum quod Deum amet germanè: sed & quod
ab illo magnum honorem assecutus est, magnam item dilectionem:
The faithfull man boasteth or reioyceth, not onely
that he truely loueth God; but also for that he hath receiued
much honour & loue from God. Faith therefore perswadeth
our hearts that God loueth vs.

water, and his spirit, and his word: And my redemption
is his blood, whilest hee gaue himselfe for me as the true
lambe the price of my redemption. What did Paul affirme

haue no faith at all.

beleeued, yet they said, what haue wee to doe with thee Iesu
thou Sonne of God? But let vs beleeue so, as wee may beleeue
in him, and loue him: Et non dicamus, Quid nobis &

And let vs not say as the deuills said, what haue we
to doe with thee? as desirous not to come neere him; But
let vs say rather, We are thine, we pertaine to thee, thou
hast redeemed vs, as drawing him and his merits home vnto
our selues. Now let a Papist tell me, how a man shall
cheerefully goe to Christ, and say vnto him, I belong to
thee, thou hast redeemed mee, without a faith laying hold
of speciall mercie.

God onely can forgiue sinne is well, but not sufficient: To
beleeue further, that God hath forgiuen thy sinne to thee;
this is necessarie. This is the testimonie of the holy ghost
in thee, which cannot deceiue thee, Thy sinnes are forgiuen
thee. He therefore which hath receiued true faith, which
is the gift of the holy Ghost, and by which the holy ghost
testifieth to the conscience: he by this faith beleeueth forgiuenesse

se esse liberandos: God hath determined to be mercifull

his blood. Short and sweete: Hope well, and haue well:
Beleeue deliuerance, and take deliuerance. But without
beleefe of that, there is no deliuerie.
            It is therefore no new Doctrine (as say our right Worshipfull
Masters of the Historie) no nor rashnesse, and presumption,
(as say Lindane, and Bellarmine, and other Papists)
by faith to applie in particular mercie to thy selfe.
No: heare S. Augustine challenging such presumption

hic arrogantia est, sed fides: Praedicare quod acceperi
                     •
                  , non
superbia est sed deuotio: Could any thing be spoken more
contrary to the doting Papists? They dubbe applying faith,
with the name of Presumption: and vnder that name condemne



it for a sinne. But what saith S. Augustine? Presume,
so it be not of thine own workes, but of the grace of Christ.
For by grace are yee saued, saith the Apostle. Herein (thus
to presume) is no arrogancie, but faith. To professe or acknowledge
what thou hast receiued, is not pride, but deuotion.
So then there is an holy presumption or confidence
in the grace and mercie of God, the profession wherof
is the fruit of faith.
            
            We see then what note the olde Fathers song. Now
if I shew that a number euen of Popish Writers haue taught
this applying faith, and apprehending by faith of speciall
mercie, I shall not onely cut the combes of our audacious
Englishmen, who of grosse ignorance (if not of secret malice)
ascribe the fountaine of this Doctrine to Geneua: but
I shall also turne the edge of the Papists swords vpon
themselues, and cause them first to answer their owne, before
they proceede so peremptorily against strangers. Thus
therefore I goe on in that course, and will summon also an
Inquest of them.

perswaded that God carrieth a fatherly affection towards
him?

and (saith hee) say thus to the Deuill in thy
selfe, or in thine owne heart by a steadfast faith: O humani
generis inimice, hoc non me vinces pacto, nec me falles. O Sathan,
thou enemie of mankind, thou shalt not thus ouercome
mee, nor deceiue mee. Quia cùm credam Deum esse,
& illum Deum meum esse, Patrem meum, Dominum meum,
&c. Thou shalt not ouercome me: for why? Because I
beleeue there is a God, and that this God is my God, my
Father, my Lord, and all good things to me. Marke how
he teacheth the King the art of application: and by a faith
applying the goodnesse of God vnto himselfe, to resist
the Deuill. Now, no man can say, God is my God, my
Father, my Lord, &c. but by a speciall confidence in
his mercie. And for the manifestation thereof, let me here
insert a saying of S. Augustine (though he be none of that
band which now I am mustering) to shew what manner of
faith that is, which maketh a man to crie with S. Thomas,

confident loue towards God: say, My God. It was obiected
to the Protestants in Queene Maries dayes, as a note
of an Heretike, to say, my God, my Father, my Sauiour, &c.
Indeed S. Augustine saith, Euery man cannot say so: and
no maruaile if those bloodie persecutors durst not speake
so. For a man to say with a good conscience, God is my
God, or God is my Lord: hee must haue by faith, feeling
of Gods mercie, and as a fruit of this faith, loue towards
God for his mercie: and then he may comfortably applie
God, and as it were, appropriate God vnto himselfe, as his
peculiar owne, and with this faith resist all temptations of
the Deuill, as Gerson well aduised that his Roiall Auditorie.

these kinds of faith are required of him, whose sinnes are
forgiuen. Of the first kind of faith he saith, that he which
beleeueth not the things that belong to God, cannot bee

For although a man doe beleeue all that is contained
in the holy Scriptures, and all that which the Church
beleeueth, (there is iumpe Bellarmines faith,) yet if he do
not beleeue that the Lord will forgiue him, if he sorrowe
for his sinne (there is apprehension of mercie,) they shall
neuer be forgiuen him. Imo etiamsi peteret illa dimitti, si non
confideret, & certissimè crederet illa sibi dimittenda, nunquam
dimittentur: yea though a man do pray that his sinnes may
be forgiuen, if hee trust not, and most certainely beleeue
(marke that against doubting) that they shall be forgiuen
him, they shall neuer bee forgiuen him. The words are
long, but neede no long glosse. There is a faith, which is
confidence or assurance of Gods mercie towards vs. And
without this faith of obtaining mercie, it is not possible to
finde mercie at the hand of God. Well fate (say I then)
that kinde of faith, which

faith is not without confidence of the mercie of God
promised in Christ. A grosse Lutheran; yet hee prooueth

that there was a God? Yes, he beleeued the promise of God,
when God said to him,Gen. 15. 1. 
               Feare not Abraham, I am thy buckler
and reward. Abraham relying vpon this promise went
out of his owne land, &c. and he trusted in the mercie and

But he proceedeth, and of this kind of faith he expoundeth
these places:Deut. 1. 32.

                   per Christum praestaudae: He speaketh
not there (saith Ferus) of an historicall or vnformed faith:
but of a confidence in the mercie of God to be yeelded by



Christ. Many other instances hee there giueth, but at

is nothing else then to trust in the free mercie of
God; This is that true faith, by which the iust man liueth:
this faith onely doth God require of vs: and for the confirmation
of this faith, he hath also giuen his Sonne, that

we should repose our trust in God. Thus sarre Frier Ferus,

And then deliuereth his present opinion about it:
which is this; That, So faith doe signifie, veram, viuam, &

The iustifying faith then is a resting vpon Christ with comfort,
and an embracing of him with ioy: which no man
can doe, which is not perswaded by and in Christ to finde
mercie of God.

certaine knowledge of Gods fatherly good will towards
vs thorough Christ, and a confidence in the same good will
of God: as it is testified in the Gospel. This is the Doctrine
of our Church concerning iustifying faith. Those
therefore which secretly whisper otherwise, doe greatly
wrong our Church, and Church-gouernours: yea, indeed
they greatly wrong themselues, to resort with vs to the
Word, where such a faith is preached, to communicate
with vs in the Sacraments, where such a faith is s

faith is maintained: and in the meane time to iumpe close
with the Papists against vs, in so essentiall a point of Saluation.
            I will now conclude this Doctrine with her example, of
whom I am perswaded all true hearted Englishmen will
be gladde to heare: that same olde Mother and Nurse
of this Church of England: that same glorious Defender
of this true, auncient, Catholike and Apostolike faith, so
many yeares: that same raiser vp, and protector of all those
Bishops, and other learned men, that haue taught and confirmed
this Doctrine of apprehensiue, and applying faith among
vs: I meane the late Queene Elizabeth, a woman of
most famous: and most renowned memorie. She

the preaching of this faith, she maintained this faith, she
liued in this faith: yea she died in this faith, applying the
mercies of God, by the merits of Christ to her owne soule.
As appeareth in a Sermon put forth in print, preached in
this very place, the next Sabbaoth day after her decease,
by a Preacher of reuerend respect in this Citie, and familiarly
knowne to me to be both wise, and learned, and religious,
and so one that would not gloze, nor dissemble
in the matter. It was spoken here now tenne yeares agoe:

lying vpon her death bed, M. Watson then Bishop of Chichester,
and her Almoner, rehearsed to her the grounds of
Christian faith, requiring some testimonie of her assenting

And when hee proceeded to tell her, that it was not inough
generally to beleeue that those things were true, but
euery Christian man must beleeue, that they were true to
them, that they were members of the true Church, truely
redeemed by Iesus Christ, that their sinnes were forgiuen,
&c. shee did with great shew of faith, lift vp her eyes,
and hands to heauen, and staied them long, as in testimonie
of her assent thereunto. O bessed Queene that liued so
gloriously, that died so Christianly; that wasAlanus Copus dial. 5. cap. 11.

is euer ioyned with confidence in the mercie of God, and
of Christ: and in truth is a comfortable Effect of the same.
The Deuills and the Reprobates knowe God and Christ,
what they are, and what they haue done for mans saluation,
as well as we: but they affect not with liking tha

which they know, because they are not perswaded of any
loue, mercie, or kindnesse in God towards themselues.
But the true beleeuer, as he knoweth them, so hee liketh to
know them, and is affected to them in loue: as perswaded
that all the goodnesse, loue, mercie, and fauour which
is in God and in Christ, doe belong vnto him: and thus to

            Thirdly,P. Mart. Com. in Rom. 1. 19. 
               Sciendum duplicem esse Deinotitiam, saith Peter
Martyr: we must know, that there is in a man a double
kind of the knowledge of God. Vnam efficacem, qua
immutamur, ita vt quae nouimus, opere conemur exprimere:
alteram frigidam, qua nihilo reddimur meliores: There is one
an effectuall kind of knowledge, by which we are so changed
in heart and affection, as we striue to expresse in our
deeds, that which we know. Of which kind, I take that
to be spoken of S. Paul to the Colossians:Coloss. 
                     •
                  . 10. 
               Yee haue put
on the new man, which is renued in knowledge, after the image
of him that created him. Now this is such a knowledge, as
Gualth hom. 149. in Ioh. 17. ariseth of faith, and by faith ioyneth vs to God, and beeing
vnited to him, transformeth vs into his image. There
is an other kind of knowledge vneffectuall; which maketh
a man neuer the better. Such a one as S. Paul saith
was in the Gentiles:Rom. 1. 
                     •
                  1. 
               When they knew God, they glorified
him not as God.
               28. Againe, As they regarded not to know God,
&c. This the Deuills and reprobates haue, and are neuer
the better. But to know God effectually, so as we are by
faith vnited to him whom we know, and by our vnion
with him doe communicate his Spirit, and by that Spirit
are renued vnto his image in holines; this is a knowledge
which necessarily draweth after it eternall life.
            
            Fourthly, I would haue this well marked, as materiall,
Muse. Com
                     •
                  . in Phil. 3. 10. 
               Duplex est cognoscendi Christi modus: There is a double
manner or sort of knowing Christ. Primus est annexus fid
                     •
                  i,
&c. The one, is an appendix to faith: the other, consisteth
in a liuely, or experimentall feeling. Faith carrieth
with it that knowledge, by which hee that beleeueth in
Christ, knoweth him to be the true Sonne of God, sent
into the world, crucified, put to death for our sinnes, &c.
This faith, and this knowledge, are both historicall. There
is an other kind of knowing Christ, by which we feele and
haue experience of his power in vs, which feeling is by the



operation of the holy Ghost working in our hearts. And
this S. Paul desireth yet more and morePhilip.

and the power of his resurrection. Hee knew Christ, and all
things belonging to the Historie of Christ in an abundant

Christs resurrection: that is, synechdochice,

knowne, when we feele what Christs death and resurrection
can doe, and how it is operatiue, or effectuall in vs. To
haue this feeling knowledge of Christ, is an inuincible argument
that Christ dwelleth in vs by his Spirit, and so is an
assurance vnto vs of eternall life. Now, to conioyne all
these together. So to know God and Christ, as to beleeue:
to know and beleeue them with affectionate liking, with
effectuall working, with sensible feeling: this knowledge
certainely is eternall life, as our Sauiour Christ speaketh in
that place of the Gospell. But on the otherside, to make
our s

from the example of the heathen Eununch conuerted and
baptised.Act. 8. 36.
After that Philip had preached Christ vnto him,
and hee had desired baptisme;17. Philip telleth him, If thou
beleeuest with all thy heart,

engraffed into the Church.

Eunuch did more, and said more, then the Scripture hath
expressed: & that the scripture hath omitted many things
therein, breuitatis gratia: and therefore that is no good argument
to prooue that the Eunuch made none other profession,
because there is no more recorded. The Scriptures

to beleeue in Christ, is a great deale more, then to professe
him to be the Sonne of God. Therefore that example carrieth
no weight of argument.
            I am putting now my shippe into the hauen: onely this
I must adde, that after this confirmation of the truth, and
confutation of falsehood; this doctrine of faith apprehending


               
and applying the mercie of God, would be seriously and
effectually driuen home by Exhortation to the hearts and
consciences of the hearers. The Papists would be adiured
by the high and sauing name of the Lord Iesus, no longer
to feede themselues and the people, with the courser morsels
of faith alone, neglecting that which is the flower
and marrowe of faith; and which while they neglect, they
omit the very life and substance of the whole Gospel. Our
Historians would be exhorted, not to deceiue themselues
with a broader, nigher, and easier way to heauen, then
God himselfe hath chalked out; least they fall into that
which leadeth to destruction. And lastly, all wee present
should be carefully admonished, to vse all holy meanes by
which this sauing and iustifying faith, might be kindled, increased,
and continued in our hearts. Therefore had wee
neede diligently and conscionably to read the Scriptures,
to heare the word preached, to frequent the Sacraments.
yea, we had need to pray much to God, to meditate much
with our selues, to conferre much with others, for the
strengthening of our consciences in the same. But this
place beeing by vse almost wholly appropriated vnto Doctrine,
hardly admitteth any length of Exhortation. This
therefore onely I will adde: I preach these things to you,

my selfe well see and know my weakenesse therein.
But I say on still with the Apostle, I followe, if that I may
comprehend that, for whose sake also I am comprehended
