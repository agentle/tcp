            To be ſung to a new tune, called Woodicocks Hill.
            
            
               ONe Iemie there was that dwelt in a towne,
               as proper a man as proper might be:
               A wife he had would ſcold and frowne,
               and euermore call him noddie noddie.
               A wife he had would ſcold and frowne,
               and euermore calt him noddie, noddie.
            
            
               This Iemie did riſe betime in the morne,
               and forth of his doores he haſted truly:
               But before he came home he was crownd with a horn
               for his wife did vſe her hei nonnie nonnie.
               But before he came, &c.
            
            
               
                  Iemie did put his lambs to field,
               thinking good ſhéepe that they would be,
               But all his lambs were turnd to rams,
               and the hornes they fell to Iemie, Iemie.
               But all his, &c.
            
            
               
                  Iemie he hied to woodicock hill,
               for there his buſineſſe lay truly:
               In which time an other did worke his will,
               and tickled his wiues hei nonnie nonnie.
               In which, &c.
            
            
               Now god a mercie ſaid Iemies wife,
               euermore welcome ſhalt thou be:
               Ile loue thée 
                     〈◊〉
                  
               
               becauſe thou haſt p

                     〈◊〉
                  . &c.
               Ile loue thée, &c.
            
            
               
                  Iemie at length came home with ſpéed,
               and ſtept to the doore ſo cloſely:
               And through the key hole he ſpied indéed,
               how one there did tickle his, &c.
               And through the, &c
            
            
               Zounds quoth Iemie, and then he ſweares,
               is this poſſible for to be?
               Come open the doore, Ile haue him by the eares,
               for playing the rogue with my, &c.
               Come, &c.
            
            
               Thou knaue (quoth Iemie) Ile make thée rue,
               that euer thou didſt come héere truly:
               Ile ſend for the Conſtable, Ile tell thée true,
               and haue thée plagued moſt mightily.
               Ile ſend, &c.
            
            
               Ile cauſe you both be whipped ſure,
               throughout the towne moſt ſhamefully:
               Repent it you ſhall while your liues endure,
               for playing the knaue and the whore truly.
               Repent, &c.
            
            
               Then ſaid the man this Iemie too:
               I pray you now contented be:
               Ile giue you fiue pounds, make no more adoo,
               becauſe I haue tickled your, &c,
               Ile giue you, &c.
            
            
               Wilt thou (qd. Iemie) this match then Ile make,
               if that fiue pound thou wilt giue me:
               My wife for euer thou ſhalt forſake,
               and neuer more meddle with her, &c.
               My wife, &c.
            
            
               But when ſhall I this money receiue,
               the which you promiſed haue to me?
               At Michelmas next I wil it thée giue,
               if that thou ſo contented be.
               At &c.
            
            
               Then (quoth Iemie) for that which is paſt,
               vpon thy faire promiſe I wil thée forgiue:
               Then Ile not come neare thy wife by two ſtones caſt,
               ſo long as we both togither ſhal liue.
               Then, &c.
            
            
               Now friends, what thinke you this Iemie of?
               that for lucre of money contented was he,
               To put vp Cuckold? it made me to laugh:
               ſo I tooke vp my pen, and wr
                     •
                  t noddie noddie.
               To put vp, &c.
            
            
               And euermore after this Iemie he,
               grew vp to promotion euerie day:
               Knight of the Forked Order truly:
               from that time forth was counted alway.
               Knight, &c.
            
            
               Farewell friend Iemie, looke wel to thy charge,
               thy name ſhal neuer be knowne for me:
               Looke wel to thy wife, let her not run at large,
               but let it alway be a warning to thée.
               Looke, &c.
            
            
               Would I were as ſure of an hundred pounds,
               as this ſame Iemie doth thinke truly:
               How ſome other beſides himſelfe in the towne,
               ſometimes wil meddle with his hey, &c.
               How ſome, &c.
            
            
               And ſo to conclude, I am loath to be long,
               I pray thée Iemie take it not heauily:
               I pray giue me ſome béere for ſinging this ſong,
               and ſo I pray God make you all merrie, merrie.
               I pray, &c.
            
            FINIS.
