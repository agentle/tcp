            To the Chriſtian Reader.
            
               AS there haue riſen vp in the Church from time to time falſe Prophets & teachers, 2. Pet. 2. 1. which oppoſe them ſelues to the holye Prophets of God, and true teachers of his worde: ſo among the people where ſuch contrarietie of doctrines hath bene deliuered, like contrarietie of hearers hath alwayes followed, not onely in iudgement, but alſo in their affection. For as ſome through the mercie of God and the ſincere preaching of the Goſpel, haue yeelded obedience to his worde: ſo many, caried away with corrupt teachers, haue for want of iudgement embraced errour in place of trueth, and carnall worſhippings, in ſteade of the pure worſhip of God, which euermore conſiſteth Iohn. 4. 24. in ſpirit and trueth. Againſt this ſo dangerous infection of falſe teachers, the holy Apoſtle Saint Iohn hath giuen vs a moſt wholeſome counterpoyſon: willing vs not to beleeue euery ſpirit, but to trie and examin the ſpirits whether 1. Iohn. 4. 1. they be of God. But (to ſpeake of our times) this examination and trial may ſeeme very hard, ſeeing the teachers on both ſides are thought learned, and al pretend to teach the trueth. For, it is not denyed but both ſides haue had their education in ſchooles of learning, they haue alſo laboured in the liberall artes, to furniſh them ſelues to greater matters: wherupō they al bring very good words, ſome ſhewe of reaſon, & ſeeme to haue no ſmall force of perſwaſion. Howe then ſhall the ſimple people iudge, howe ſhal they diſcerne, whoſe iudgement and diſcretion ſhould be framed by their teachers, and ſetled by their

ſownd, and plaine doctrine? To this I anſwere, S. Iohn in that place maketh the matter more eaſy then it appeareth at the firſt ſhewe. For, exhorting vs not to beleeue euery ſpirit, he doeth drawe our conſideration to the ſpirit and doctrine of the teachers, and not to theſe outwarde giftes of an eloquent ſtile, or a ſweete ſownde of pleaſing wordes, which may be common to good and euil: yea wherein the euil, for want of a good cauſe labour to excell, and from which the godly abſteine for the ſufficiencie of their cauſe without it, & are alſo reſtrayned, leſt our faith ſhould ſtande in the wiſedome of men, and not in the 2. Cor. 2. 5. power of God. But Saint Iohn, to make this his trial of ſpirits yet more ful & plaine, addeth, that euery ſpirit which confeſſeth Chriſt Ieſus to haue 1. Iohn. 4. 2. come in the fleſhe, is of God, and euery ſpirit which confeſſeth otherwiſe, is of Antichriſt. Now therefore, let vs ſee bowe the Apoſtle frameth vs to a ſpirit of diſcretion, to diſcerne the ſpirits of true and falſe teachers. If any man ſhall teach and conſeſſe that Chriſt was made man, and ordeyned of God the Father a Prophet, alone to teach: a King, alone to rule: and a Prieſt, alone to ſanctifie vs, and to reconcile vs to his Father by the obedience of faith, this confeſſion and doctrine is of the holy ſpirit of God, and to be receiued, what ſpirit ſoeuer ſhall mightily or cunningly perſwade the contrary. On the other ſide, if any ſpirit ſhall teach that Chriſt is not our only teacher by his holy Goſpel, but that we muſt admit vnwritten beleefe and traditions, from we know not whom, to be of like authoritie with the written worde: ſecondly, if any ſpirit make not Chriſt alone our King and head to rule vs by his holy ſpirit, but teache that a mortall and ſinfull

man muſt ſit in our conſciences, and for hatred or gaine (which is his practiſe) bynde or looſe at his pleaſure: laſtly, if any ſpirit impeach the alſufficiencie and entier vertue of Chriſts ſacrifice offered vp once for euer, & teach that themſelues muſt renforce it from day to day by the continuance Heb. 7. 27. & 9. 12. 26. 28. & 10. 10. of their dayly ſacrifice of the Maſſe, offered for the quick & dead: it appeareth manifeſtly, that ſuch ſpirits are not of God, nor their doctrine to be receiued, though it be deliuered with neuer ſo much perſwaſion of eloquent ſpeach, or offered to vs with neuer ſo much expectation of worldly honour. For, to denie the moſt abſolute vertue and effects of Chriſtes offices, is in effect to denie the authoritie of his perſon, and to loſe the benefite of all his graces, becauſe they withdrawe a part. To this examination of ſpirits, without regard of perſons, the godly Reader is to be exhorted. For the doctrine that giueth al glorie to God, is of God: the doctrine that attributeth ſome glory and aſcribeth ſome merites to man, is of men: the religion alſo that is agreeable to fleſh and blood, making an acceptable ſounde and ſhewe to the outward ſenſes, is carnall and vayne: finally, what religion ſo euer is not ioyned with the knowledge and exerciſes of the worde of God, that is no true religion, but a diſguiſed and blinde maſke full of deuiliſh ſuperſtition. The aduerſaries take a contrary courſe in making triall of their doctrine: for they woulde haue this examination of ſpirits vtterly ſuppreſſed, and vnder one title of that falſly named Catholique Church of Rome, they would bind all men to receiue for vndoubted true religion what corruptions ſo euer they teach, without any further queſtion. Which being graunted them, the examination of ſpirits

neede not: for if Rome affirme it, the matter is ſufficient and muſt not be denied. Alſo theſe enemies of the trueth leaue the touchſtone, which tryeth al metalles, namely the doctrine, and for it they drawe the teachers into examination: ſuppoſing that if they can diſcredit or diſgrace the men, they ſhall eaſily vndermine and ouerthrowe their doctrine. For triall of this long practiſe, there are ſo many bookes, that I neede not alleadge any, but this late Cenſure written as in defence of popiſh religion: but the authour ſhifting his hands very cunningly of the direct and plaine maintenance of the queſtions in controuerſie, doth but offer at them, or giue ſome falſe fire: his leauell and batterie is againſt their perſons and credit, that maynteining the trueth, cannot but aſſaile the doctrines, and put in hazarde the authoritie of the popiſh Church.
            Therefore I am in the name of the trueth to craue it of the good Reader, to lay aſide reſpect of men, & the regard of thoſe giftes that may pleaſe him much; and deceiue him more: and if it be his deſire, not ſo much to ſee the fight, as to beholde the iſſue & enioy the victory: then let him imbrace that doctrine moſt, that attributeth leaſt to the broken arme, or blinde iudgement of man, that in the Church al the power and wiſedome of our ſaluation may be aſcribed to God alone, through Chriſt Ieſus our Lorde.
            Amen.

               A Replie to a Cenſure written againſt the two anſwers to a Ieſuites ſeditious Pamphlet.
            
               IT is much to be lamented, that in the things of this life, there is not a cauſe ſo good, nor a title ſo iuſt, but when it is brought into queſtion, the quarelling partie will readily finde out ſome forme of pleading againſt it, & in the iudgement of ye ignorant or partial hearer, ſeeme to haue a good cauſe & great reaſon on his ſide, when in deede, he hath neither the one nor the other. But it is much more to be lamented, that in the thinges of a better life, namely in the matters of our ſaluation, there is nothing ſo plaine in the word of God, nothing ſo agreeable with the vſe of the primatiue Church, but it hath enemies that crie out againſt the light as if it were darkeneſſe, and againſt the trueth as if it were falſhoode, whereby the ignorant are interteyned in their ignorance, and the obſtinate hardened in their rebellion.
            Yf the trueth be ſubiect to ſuch iniuries and reproches, they that mayntaine the

trueth, muſt partake with it alſo, but alwayes with an affiance therein, that it is mightie and will preuaile. As many alſo as loue the trueth, & yet for want of knowlege, do as it were ſtagger in ſo great contrari

                  . about with euery blaſt of doctrine, in the vncerteintie or hazard of men, who are exerciſed in cunning waies, and lye in waite to deceiue. For this Religion is not true, becauſe ſuch learned men teach it, or that falſe, becauſe ſuch wiſe men doe condemne it: but whatſoeuer is truely taught, and playnely proued by the holy worde of God, if thou 
                  ••
               care it with feare and reuerence, that wil confirme thy iudgement, and eſtabliſh thy heart in a good conſcience of the trueth. But in handling theſe controuerſi

                the godly to a great hatred of error, and a blind loue of ſuperſtition carie away others to the ſlaunder of wholeſome doctrine: let both ſides remember, that there is one that ſ

               eth and iudgeth in theſe actions, whoſe final ſentence ſhal ſtand in that great day of the Lord Ieſus againſt Rom. 1. 18. al, that withhold the trueth in vnrighteouſneſſe.

This, being well conſidered; will ioyne chriſtian loue with godly-zeale on the one ſide, and ſomewhat ſtay the other, that they breake not out into a defyaunce of the trueth, and into the ſame open faultes, wherewith they ſo much and ſo vniuſtly accuſe others. For, many in great want of arguments, recômpenſe the matter with vnchriſtian taunts and ſlaunders; and not being able to ouerthrow the trueth, are yet alwayes armed with varietie and colout of wordes to charge it as a lye, and the defenders thereof as forgers of lyes, and as maynteiners of daumable abſurdities. Notwithſtanding, as the trueth was not tied 2. Tim. 2. 9. when Paul was in bandes: ſo good cauſes are not confuted, though the defenders thereof be neuer ſo ſcornefully reproched. This may appeare, as by many other treatiſes againſt our brethren heretofore, ſo by the late Cenſure of Ed. Campion or ſome other for him, that was more ready before hand, to deale ſomewhat with the anſwers made to his proud and ſeditious libel. For in a round ſtile this quareler would cary away the maintenance of an euil cauſe, and vnder the title & authoritie of a Cenſurer, ratifie his manifold and vniuſt accuſations,

that ſo finally he may ſit downe to giue open ſentence againſt the truth. But for an anſwere to thoſe accuſations, and a repeale of his falſe ſentence, I mind to follow him, as from line to line, where iuſt occaſion is offered, that vpon examynation it may appeare, howe little force there is againſt the naked truth of Gods cauſes, in the painted wordes of mans wiſedome.
            This Cenſurer taketh in hand the open defence of ye Ieſuites ſeditious Pamphlet, and as a man of authoritie and iudgement, to cenſure my anſwere to it: but as he hath nor perfourmed the one, ſo hee hath greatly miſſed of the other. For the argumēts alleged to proue Campions ſeditious enterpriſe in euery part of his libel, & to open the like practiſes in his fellow Ieſuites, and other Papiſtes, that imploy all their labours againſt the Church of God, and the good eſtate of this kingdome, they remaine all vnanſwered: the Cenſurer did not think it ſafe to giue his ſentence in theſe matters, although he knewe well, they were the chiefe things that he ſhould haue anſwered. The matters handled by the waye, as of the ſect and doctrine of Ieſuites, of Ed. Campions perſon, of diſputation, of Chriſtian

Frankens treatiſe againſt the Ieſuites, they are the matters that the Cenſurer hath choſen out to abide his bitter taunts, and receiue his vniuſt ſentence. Thus this iudge, that for the ſkill and authoritie hee taketh vpon him, ſhould haue cenſured the matter it ſelf, hath dealt only with certaine acceſſaries, leauing the principal cauſe in ful force againſt the Ieſuite.
            But for proofe hereof, to come now to the Cenſure, Campion o
                  •
                the like ſpirit in ſome other petie champion, doth at his entraunce, giue an aduertiſment to abuſe his reader, that the Ieſuites offer required not ſo much an anſwere in writing, as ſhorter triall in diſputation. In which wordes he would ſeeme to make it a matter out of doubt, that he & his confederates can ſoone confute the religion eſtabliſhed, and by a ſhort way defende their Popiſh ſuperſtition, if they might come to the triall. But theſe few wordes do bewray much vanitie. For who is Campion, or who are the reſt of theſe ſeedmen, that they ſhould preſume ſo much of themſelues, as to make ſo ſhort worke in anowing that popiſh religiō, that hath nothing to vphold it but tyrannie, nothing to defend it but lies, nothing to reſtore

it but hypocriſie & rebellion: Where haue theſe diſputers ſtaied ſo long time: Now they are come, what can they get by renewing the battaile ſo often, and ſo lately refuſed and auoided by their chiefe fathers & auncient captaines: Surely, if your ſtudied D. Watſon. M. Peoknam & prepared bookes, be a ſure argument what you can doe in a preſent diſputation, then I doubt not, if it were graunted, but you would therein make a ſhort tria

ſuggeſtions, you haue iudged before the time, and one, who by the grace of God is well able to proue his ſpeciall hatren of flatterie and gaine by ſuch vngodly meanes. In the fifth reproch I take it as a plaine note of ſomewhat, that your eares tingle and are wearied with the termes of Pope and Poperie. But your infinite repetition of ſuch ſuperſtitions cauſe often repetition of theſe fitteſt wordes to expreſſe the ſame: for the matter muſt be weariſom and worne out with you, before the proper termes thereof be worne out or buried with vs. Neither can I promiſe it then, for as the notorious ſuperſtition of Scribes and Phariſees, the iniquitie of Pilate, and the hardneſſe of Pharao while they liued, will in no age ſuffer their odious names to die: ſo the Pope and poperie may for like rebellion receiue the like puniſhment, remayning for euer in all deteſtation. But you (for what cauſe I can eaſely geſſe) haue ſcarſely once mencioned the Pope in all your booke, although hee be your Lorde and father, and to you neerer and deerer, then either the Prince, or the loue of your countrey.
            Vpon my anſwere you promiſed to enlarge

your ſelfe, and in brotherly loue: but you do onely enlarge your ſelfe in anſwering a fewe articles cited againſt the Ieſuites out of Donatus Gotuiſus: in all the reſt you are very ſhort, ſo that my anſwere is not anſwered, but by your malicious and bold Cenſure here and there noted, for a worde or for a ſyllable, making litle for you or againſt me: in the reſt it is charged and ouercharged, with your free taunts and vniuſt ſentence. Your brotherly charitie, I thinke, is ſomewhere els beſtowed.
            My order in anſwering the pamphlet from point to point, it pleaſeth you to call rouing, that you may perſwade the reader, I did not leauell at the certaine marke in my aunſwere, nor keepe a right order. Wherein you giue me occaſion to ſpeake of your order, which may fitly be called a diſorder, ſuch as alſo may bee looked for 
                  〈◊〉
                your hands, if you & your fellowes ſhould come to diſputation. The order you haue framed to your ſelfe in foure partes: firſt; touching the ſect of Ieſuites: ſecondly, touching Campion: thirdly, touching the challenge: and laſtly, touching the dialogue added to the anſwere, is at your pleaſure, to roue in deede at your owne markes, to bee

large or ſhorte, to touch or paſſe by, to anſwere or leaue vnanſwered, as may ſerue beſt for your ſkill and make moſt for your purpoſe. Notwithſtāding, ſeeing you haue frained this order, and layde downe theſe 4. partes to my hande, I will followe them in the ſame order, leaſt I might ſeeme with you to make ſome anſwere where I pleaſe, and let the reſt alone.
            
               Touching the Ieſuites.
               I Acknowledge my labour imployed to bring in diſcredit the Ieſuites, whoſe infections The firſt part. are well knowne abroade, and are nowe entred to worke treaſon in the land. Alſo I graunt the ſpeaches which in al hatred of Popiſh practiſes, ſo directly attempted againſt the Maieſtie of God, and peace of this noble kingdome, I vttered in diuers places of my anſwere, and are nowe by you not vnfitly gathered together to be ſeene in one view. And becauſe you charge me with ordinarie rayling, I might fully requite you with placing your ordinarie and extraordinarie railings in one ranke, that you may knowe your owne, and take

them home. But I haue no ſuch purpoſe: and if I had, where you haue gathered my fit wordes againſt the wicked monkiſh friers or frierly monkes to fill tenne lynes, I might gather of your reproches more then can come into tenne leaues. Therefore I leaue it to the indifferent reader of your booke to iudge with what minde it is like you accuſed mee of rayling, that rayle ſo your ſelfe, or for want of modeſtie, you that haue beene ſo immodeſt and ſo bitter, or of abſurd aſſertions, you that haue ſo many.
               Concerning your charge, that I abuſe the Ieſuites thoſe learned men: I anſwere, that godlines is true learning, and the only foundation of good life, without the 1. Tim. 4. 7. which, if they had any learning, or haue any ſhew of good life, the greater is their ſinne and hypocriſie, in imploying ſuch giftes of God to ſo vile a purpoſe, as the defence of manifeſt falſhoode and ſuperſtition. True it is, that the world doth knowe them, and ſuch as they bee: But it is a ſmall thing to be knowen or loued of the worlde: our ioye is, that God doth know his and maynteine 2. Tim. 2. 19. Pſal. 9. 4. Ier. 50. 34. their right.
               That I call the Ieſuites a ſect (which you ſo finde fault with all) it is not my doing

alone, but many haue done it before me and that learnedly, as ſhall appeare afterward. But your definition is firſt to bee noted, as comming ſomewhat out of place and vntrue. Touching the place I will not contend, the matter cannot be iuſtified, in that you define Sectaries to be in deede ſuch as cut themſelues off in opinion of religion, from the general body of the Catholike Church. For herein, as not remembring your owne arte, you confound heretiques with ſectaries, making no diſtinction, betweene the generall and the ſpeciall: for (howeſoeuer the names are ſometimes confounded) in the receiued diſtinction of matter, all heretiques are ſectaries, but all ſectaries are not heretiques: ſo that being diuers in nature, they cannot haue the ſame proper definition. Beſide your fault of confounding euen in a definition, which ſhould ſerue to diſtinction, and to bring cleere knowledge, this alſo is to bee conſidered, that of the two, it doeth moſt fitly agree vnto heretiques, whoſe ſinne & hereſie ſtandeth in cutting them ſelues off from the communion of the Church in opinion and doctrines of faith. Laſtly, though one man once diuide him ſelfe, and ſo be guiltie

in this particular of ſchiſme, yet by the word in common vſe, wee call it not a ſect, till there bee many drawen away. For if Layolas alone had troden that newe path, and vowed that ſpeciall vowe, for his diuiſion and ſuperſtitious trade, hee alone ſhould not haue bene called a ſect. Wherefore your definition hath bewrayed great want of learning.
               But to giue you a truer definition, A ſect, according to the true etymologie of y• word, is a companie of men, that differ from the reſt of their religion, eyther in matter of forme of their profeſſion. Seing therefore the Ieſuites receiue a peculiar vowe to preache as the Apoſtles did, euery where, to do it of free coſt, to whippe and torment them ſelues after the example of a ſect called by the name of whippers, and Chronica. chronic. fol. 21 5. condemned long agoe: ſeeing they alſo as a diuided companie from all others, doe followe the rule of Layolas, it appeareth plainely, the Ieſuites are a ſect. As for the examples of Elias, Elizeus, Daniel, and Iohn Baptiſt, they are no leſſe wickedly then vnlearnedly alledged, to auow their order. What are you able to bring out of the woord of God, why Elias

ſhoulde after more then 2000. yeeres bee brought in for a patrone of Friers: What was in Elizeus or Daniel, that may liken them to Ieſuites: Iohn Baptiſt that may ſeeme to make moſt, maketh nothing at all for you: for it is to be thought hee was Luk. 1. 15. an extraordinarie and perpetual Nazarite, & therefore his calling warranted him for his auſtere and extraordinarie attire and diet, which reſtraint or the like, is not nowe laid vpon thoſe that teach in the Churche; hauing all their ſeuerall offices expreſſed Rom. 12. 6. 7, 8. in the worde of God. Moreouer Iohns preaching in the wildernes of Iudea did not withdrawe him as is imagined, into ſolitarie and waſte mountaines, but the hillie part of Iudea was in compariſon of other places, called a wilderneſſe, being notwithſtanding a countrey well inhabited, as appeareth in the booke of Ioſua.

                     5 61. is cleere, that neither your definition nor examples can proue the Ieſuites to bee no ſect. Neuertheleſſe, as I haue anſwered one definition with another: ſo will I anſwere your examples farre from the matter, with examples plainelie declaring that which is in queſtion. Saint Paul doth accuſe the Corinthes of Schiſme, only

becauſe they ſaid, I am of Paul: I am of 1. Cor. 1. 10. & 11. 18. Apollos: I am of Cephas: I am of Chriſt. Theſe did not cut themſelues off in opinion of religion, they did not holde a ſeueral faith to themſelues: but for this Schiſme hee ſharpely rebuked them, ſaying, Is Chriſt deuided: Therfore the Ieſuites, following in y• like, or in more wicked ſteppes, receiue ſentence from Saint Paule, wherein they are accuſed of Schiſme, and condemned as a ſect. For do not theſe votaries of Rome, do not theſe irregulars ſay, I am of Auſtē, I am of Frauncis, I am of Dominick, and theſe laſt men, I am of Ieſus: Is Ieſus then diuided: or not rather you diuided ye Ieſuites, being cut off as heretiques from the myſticall body of Chriſt, and rent as Sectaries in your own bowels: Alſo the Phariſes are an other example to ouerthrowe your definition, & Mat. 23. 2. Actes 26. 5. Ioſeph. antiq. Iudaic. 1. lib. 13. pag. 394. proue y• Ieſuits a ſect. For they did not cut off themſelues from the religion of the Church, yet for their ſeuerall order they were a notorious ſect.
               As I haue plainely ſhewed, that the Ieſuites are a ſect, ſo it is true, that they are a blaſphemous ſect. For what a blaſphemy

is it to abuſe the moſt bleſſed name of Ieſus, for a colour to their blaſphemous practiſes, in rooting out the pure and ſincere preaching of the Goſpell, that afterwarde they may bring in all the execrable ſuperſtitions & hereſies of Poperie, and after many outrages, eſtabliſhe againe the intolerable yoke of Antichriſt: This alſo increaſeth the offence, that they drawe to themſelues alone, the moſt gracious and comfortable title of our fellowſhip and vnion in Chriſt Ieſus, which is common to Eph. 3. 6. Eph. 4. 4. all that do beleeue, without any diuiſion or diſtinction. Wherefore, howſoeuer the diſcouerie went neere the heart, and made you complaine, for me to call the Ieſuites a blaſphemous ſect, was neither lewd nor vnlearned. It is one of your nothings to make a ſhew of ſomething, when you ſay, they call not themſelues Ieſuites, but the Societie of Ieſus: making a diſtinction where none is, or if there hee any, it is made againſt the receiued ſpeach euery where, and againſt your ſelfe, who, in calling them ſo often Ieſuites, doe by the practiſe allowe your ſelfe the libertie of that ſpeach, which you reprehend in mee.

the other againſt Martin Luther and the profeſſors of the trueth. For the Ieſuites he bringeth this reaſon: Whoſoeuer leauing his former calling, ſhall betake him ſelfe to a votaries lyfe, and therein winne ſoules, may be f
                     •
                  ther of a Societie: Layolas did ſo: therefore Layolas may be father of a Societie. The firſt propoſitiō is omitted by the Cenſurer, but without it 
                     •
                  e can proue nothing for the Ieſuites. For if any man leauing the fielde, or the like calling, maye not begin a newe order as Layolas did, howe can Layolas & his broode 
                     •
                  uſtifie their Societie? The ſecond propoſition, y• 
                  Layolas, leauing his former calling, proued ſo good a man and wonne ſoules, is more then doubtfull. Thus it appeareth, that vpō two former propoſitions, the one falſe, the other doubtfull, the Cenſurer can make no true or cleare concluſion, that the Ieſuites haue a good warrant for their newe Apoſtleſhip. Againſt y• profeſſors of the Goſpell, there is another argument made, but with a
                     •
                   ill arte and ſucceſſe. For thus the Cenſurer doth reaſon: If Luther were a wicked man, & taught many beaſtly doctrines, the Proteſtantes may be aſhamed of their progenitor: but Luther was

ſuch a one: therefore the proteſtantes may bee aſhamed of their father and religion. The firſt propoſition is altogether falſe: for Luther is not our progenitour, nor the father of our faith. If he had offended, yet the trueth and profeſſors thereof are not guiltie, or thereby iuſtly touched in credit. The ſeconde propoſition is alſo falſe: for howſoeuer falſe witneſſes come in one vpon another to ſweare againſt him, Martin Luthers worthy praiſe, ſhall continue in all ages: the Lord hath ſhewed him a token of Pſal.

                  aūderous concluſion. Thus the Cenſurer appeareth much more carefull, ſmothely to deliuer foule reproches, then to bring a good reaſon for maintenance of his cauſe. His arguments being thus layde open, it remaineth to conſider the particular ſpeaches, whereby he ſetteth ſuch colours vpon his ſlaunders deliuered againſt that holy and learned man Martin Luther and vpon his praiſes, for Ignatius Layolas.
               
               And firſt for the life of Ignatius Layolas, I paſſe it ouer, as a thing from the matter, and hauing in it nothing to bee

anſwered: when it commeth into the Legenda, it may haue ſome credit in your Church: but as it is nowe reported, I ſee no honour that cōmeth to you by the tale, nor harme to vs. But to you this harme maye growe, that hereafter by ſo ſlender an example, other Fryers may bee brought in as much to raygne ouer you, as you woulde raygne ouer all the Monkes and Fryers that haue bene before you.

It is his wonderfull viſion when in a traunce he did behold Ieſus receiuing him Turrian in Apologetico. pag. 10. and his fellowes into protection. You knowe that without a myracle your newe creatures of the Pope haue neyther lyfe nor ſoule.

And firſt (howeſoeuer you thinke your credit diſcharged by alledging them) Hoſius, Cochleus, Lindanus & Xaintes haue no voyce where trueth or reaſon are admitted for witneſſes. For in this action they are ſpecially

ſworne and forſworne agaynſt Martin Luther the ruine of their eſtate, beyng all agreed to lende and borowe lies, and in one tale to conſpire the death and deteſtation of his name. Although the ſentence were true, yet woulde you not cenſure him that ſhould giue ſentence againſt your vnholie father, according to Martin Luthers teſtimonie? Why then doe you thinke that we will any more admitte Lindan and his fellowes againſt Martin Luther, then you will admit him againſt the Pope?
               Therefore in alledging Lindan, Cochleus, Hoſius and Xaintes, with ſome others, you commit many faultes without any gayne to your cauſe. Firſt you abaſe your ſelfe more then needeth, in not thinking your owne credit as ſufficient with vs to proue any thing againſt vs, as their credit is. For although theſe witneſſes are daſhed in, to make a ſhewe in the margent, and to deceyue the ignorant readers that knowe neyther their names, nor their weake authoritie: yet the Cenſurer, if his name were well knowen, hath againſt vs as much credit in his owne cauſe, as Lindan hath, or Hoſius, albeit hee was your great preſident in the Councill of Trent.

Secondly in citing your owne partiall men, more carryed I thinke, with malice againſt Luther and theſe cauſes, then your ſelf, their ſentence can haue no more authoritie, then when a man doth ſtande out to beare witneſſe in his owne cauſe, or when one thiefe giueth in euidence to acquite an other. Wee goe not about to ouerbeare you in the like cauſes with the bare authoritie or reportes of Martin Luther, of Iohn Caluin, of Peter Martyr, or other like men: for theſe are all parties, and the law alloweth no ſuch for ſufficient witneſſes in their owne cauſes. Therefore, howe vnequall is your meaſure, how inſufficient is your trial in bringing ſuch teſtimonies againſt vs, as your ſelues would hiſſe at, if the lyke, or better were brought againſt you
                     〈…〉
                   Laſtly, in alleadging ſuch partiall and forſworne witneſſes, you bewray an euill cauſe, that can not otherwiſe bee maintayned, then by ſuch vnlawfull & inſufficient proofes. But (ſeeing there can be had nothing from you and your witneſſes but ſlaūders) let vs examine how ſmall cauſe you haue, ſo bitterly to ſlaunder thoſe that are gone before, and for ſo wicked purpoſes, to infect the iudgement of ſuch as ſhal come after. Entring

into the ſlaunders of Martin Luther, you giue a note, that he was the beginner of the newe Goſpel. Doe you not ſtill bewray Campions ſpirit in charging the religion nowe eſtabliſhed in this lande with nouelties, and moſt ſcornefully calling the Goſpel of Ieſus Chriſt, which we preache, a newe doctrine? This is not vpon good grounde to ſpeake againſt a fewe Fryers, but in a blaſphemous ſpirite, to ſpeake againſt God. But before I anſwere the particular ſlaunders layde downe againſt Martin Luther, I muſt againe adde that which you haue left out, namely howe Luther was begottē of a deuil. Surely this is Gab. Pr

You adde theſe wordes, that vpon a certaine emulation & contention betweene him and the Fryers of Dominiks order, hee left his religion, caſt away his habit, broke his vowes, maried

a Nunne, and by litle and litle, began to preache ſtrange newe doctrines, eſpecially tending to all libertie and carnalitie. Howe roundlye are theſe things written, and howe calme doth the floud of malicious wordes ſeeme to flowe, partly to diſgrace that, yt was lawfully done, & partly to charge him with that euill, which he neuer thought? For when the Lord did open his eyes to ſee (as many before haue ſeene) the abhominable hypocriſie and ſuperſtition of your religion and orders, no otherwiſe then for hatred thereof, he left his former ſuperſtition (which you call religion:) he caſt away alſo his ſuperſtitious order & the phariſaicall habit thereof: and thinking him ſelfe no longer tyed to his vnaduiſed and ſuperſtitious vowe, he maried in the Lorde, and all this was lawfull. That by litle and litle he began to preach ſtrāge and newe doctrines, eſpecially tending to all libertie and carnalitie, it ſhalbe founde an vntrueth deliuered againſt the man, and a malice agaynſt the doctrine which hee taught: your owne examples ſhall make the proofe.
               Firſt therfore, you charge him to teach, there is no ſinne but incredulitie: neither

can a man damne himſelfe, doe what miſchiefe

I will not here meaſure vnto you, as you haue meaſured vnto me, I wil not diſgrace you firſt, and then examine the matter: for therein you haue offered me great wrong, as ſhall appeare when I come to anſwere thoſe places. But I may plainely pronounce, that in this place you doe in wordes and matter report an opē vntruth. For Martin Luther hath no ſuch doctrine. Firſt it was farre from him to thinke there was no ſinne but incredulitie, and therfore he woulde neuer write ſo manifeſt an vntruth. He is vehement in condemning many other ſinnes, as (beſide infinite other places) it appeareth in his expounding the Operationes Luth. in Pſal. 15. Tom. 3. xv.

And hereupō he declareth what armour we haue in reſpect of Gods true promiſe, & how to anſwere when ſin troubleth the conſcience. Afterwarde ſpeaking of the riches of a beleeuer, he concludeth ſaying, Thus thou ſeeſt a Chriſtian man, or one baptiſed howe rich he is, who though willing, yet cannot loſe his ſaluatiō through his ſinnes howe great ſoeuer, except hee wil not beleeue: for no ſinnes can damne him but incredulitie alone, if faith in the promiſe of God, made to the baptiſed, returne and ſtand, all other vices are ſwallowed vp in a moment, by the ſame faith, yea by the trueth of God that can not denie

                  him ſelfe, if thou confeſſe him and cleaue faithfully to him that promiſeth. In which wordes Martin Luther ſpeaketh

not of a faith ſeparated from good workes, or accompanyed with ſinne onely; but of that faith which bringeth foorch as fruites and effectes thoſe good workes which God hath prepared, that wee ſhoulde walke in Ephe. 2. 10. Gal. 5. 6. them. This is the true and comfortable doctrine of Martin Luther, to proue it impoſſible, that the elect ſhoulde bee deceiued or fall awaye, or that the multitude of their ſinnes, ſhoulde barre the grace and promyſe of God. Wherefore ſeeing Martin Luther ſayth, Incredulitie is the greateſt ſinne, and you ſay, he affirmeth there is no ſinne but incredulitie: Seeing hee ſayeth in reſpect of Gods promyſe all the ſinnes of the righteous man without want of faith can not condemne him: and you vtter it moſt corruptly, as if he ſaide, a man can not damne himſelfe do what ſinne he can: Laſtly, ſeeing Martin Luther ſpeaketh of the elect, and you vtter it as ſpoken of all, euen of the wicked, the godly reader may beholde your malicious and falſe reportes that haue in this firſt place, hainouſly charged Martin Luther with a doctrine, which was neuer in his hearte to embrace, much leſſe in his purpoſe to publiſh by writing.

If you could proue but this one article againſt him, without your furder reproches, it were ſufficiēt to bring his honour to the duſt. But I dare auowe in your name, that you are not ſo ignorant, as not to know his cleare doctrine to the contrarie, both in other bookes, and in that from whence you drewe out theſe wordes, leauing the ſenſe behinde. I graunt he hath ſuch words, but neuer laid downe ſo nakedly, or to proue ſuch an error, as your report importeth. For ſpeaking againſt ſuch as vrged the policie of the Iewes, and layde the yoke of Moſes Law vpon chriſtians, he reſiſted this doctrine, expounding the differences

betweene the two couenantes of Gal. 3. 11. 12. & 4. 24. God: one in the miniſterie of Moſes, which is the perfect obedience af all the Law: the other in the mercie of Chriſt apprehending righteouſnes by faith. The firſt as he teacheth, apperteyned for a time to the Iewes alone, yt ſeconde afterwarde both to Iewes and Gentiles, as many as beleeue. Wherupon Rom. 2. 16. he proueth at large, that the law doth not apperteyne vnto vs, as it did to the Iewes: the yoke and ceremonies thereof, lie not vpon vs to obſerue in ſuch ſort as it preſſed them. All which doctrine, is as largely taught by the Apoſtle, proouing Rom. 6. 14. 
                     that wee are not vnder the Lawe, but vnder grace: and in another place, that the lawe was giuen becauſe of tranſgreſsion, 
                     Gal. 3. 19. 
                     til the ſeede came which was promiſed: againe in the ſame place, the Lawe was our ſchoolemaſter to Chriſt, that we might be made righteous by faith, but after faith is

                     come, we are no more vnder the ſchoolemaſter. Which places do cleerely ſhewe, yt 
                     Moſes Lawe apperteineth not to vs, as to the Iewes: wee are not vnder it as they were, the yoke and condemnation thereof doth not binde vs as it did them: which is al that Martin Luther teacheth: diſtinguiſhing

our time from their time, and our eſtate vnder Chriſt and the Goſpell, from their condition vnder Moſes and the Law, according to that excellent diſtinction of S. Iohn: The lawe was giuen by Moſes 
                     Iohn 1. 19. 
                     but grace & trueth came by Ieſus Chriſt. Wee are vnder Chriſt and vnder grace, not vnder Moſes and the yoke of his lawe: we haue the trueth and not the multitude of ſhadowes and ceremonies, that were vnder the Moſaical adminiſtration. Now, that Martin Luther did acknowledge the doctrine of the lawe profitable to vs, though the yoke and former myniſterie thereof be taken away, it appeareth by his expoſition of the Lawe, and by his wordes out of the ſame ſermon which you alleadge, where he ſaith, We receiue and acknowledge

                  not vniuerſally commaunded to all men? I anſwere, ſaieth he, they are to be kept of all and apperteyne vnto all. Thus it is

cleere, although M. Luther acknowledgeth not the yoke, the curſe, the Moſaicall gouernment, which were proper to the Iewes, and appertayne not vnto vs: yet in other reſpectes hee is plentifull in ſhewing the profite and vſe thereof to Chriſtians: for it is, as Dauid ſaith, a lanterne

You haue in many places vſed the auouch at large, which Lawiers thinke vnlearned in their caſes, and oftentimes you cite bookes not to bee

gotten, as this preface, and that booke de miſſa angulari, and laide downe one title for an other, with ſuch like practiſes, to occupie your anſwerer more in finding out your places, then in making anſwere to foure of your bookes. But I thought only to note your practiſe herein: nowe let vs returne vnto the matter. Martin Luther doeth neyther him ſelfe exclude Matthewe, Marke, or Luke, from beyng the Goſpel, neyther woulde he haue anye man barre the other writings of the Apoſtles from that title, becauſe all that was written by the foure Euangeliſts, and what ſo euer the holy Apoſtles wrote beſide in the newe Teſtament, all that is one Goſpel in ſubſtance, though there be foure whoſe ſeuerall bookes vſually are called foure ſeuerall Goſpels. Therefore to ſpeake of the foure Euangeliſts firſt, in reſpect that the holy Ghoſt vſed them as foure pennes, and foure witneſſes, all writing the Goſpel and ſtorie of the doctrine Act. 1. 2. and deedes of Chriſt: we may ſay there are foure Goſpels. But in reſpect they

                  te in an heauenly harmony, in one Spirite, in one trueth, for one and the ſame woorke of faith, the Goſpell being one and the ſame

in all foure, there are not foure, but one Goſpell. As for the reſt of the Apoſtles, what they haue left to the treaſure of the Church in the booke of God, that alſo is the ſame Goſpel, and the Apoſtle doth call Rom. 2. 16. &. 16. 25. 1. Theſſ. 1. 5. his doctrine and Epiſtles by that name: which is to be obſerued for auoyding a corrupt iudgement, in thinking leſſe authoritie or maieſtie of Goſpell in the Epiſtles, then is in the bookes of the foure Euangeliſts: for in reſpect that they were ſent from the Apoſtle, to the Churches abſent, they are called Epiſtles: as other mens letters are called in like caſe: but in reſpect of the doctrine therein deliuered, it is the ſame which ſaint Luke and ſaint Iohn did write, and beare no leſſe honour, howe ſo euer ſome cuſtome of ſpeach otherwiſe doeth hinder a right iudgement in this behalfe.
               To this thirde article onely hath the Cenſurer giuen his Cenſure, wherein hee hath not ſo much reproched Luther, as bewrayed ſome want of exerciſe or iudgement in the Scriptures. His wordes are that Luther ſaide this, becauſe the other three Goſpels ſpake too much of good workes: whereby the Cenſurers opinion is cleere, that Saint Iohn ſpeaketh leſſe

of good woorkes then the reſt. I graunt that Iohn hath a ſpeciall courſe in deſcribing the diuinitie of Chriſt, and the loue of God towarde vs: but that hee is inferiour to the reſt in teaching good workes. I can not graunt it, neither can the Cenſurer proue it. But for proofe of that I ſay, one or two places of many may be ſufficient. If loue be the fulfilling of the Lawe, and the newe commaundement, not to loue Iohn 13. 34. one another, as euery man loueth him ſelf, but more perfectly and more aboundantly, as Chriſt hath loued vs: if to bring foorth much fruite, as branches in the vine, be the Iohn 15. 2. fountaine of euery good work: if to follow the ſhepheard Chriſt and to obey his voyce, Iohn 10. 4. be better then al ſacrifices: then Iohn doth moſt mightily teach the true doctrine of good woorkes.

Alſo hee ſayth it was his aduice, when hee was holden with the feare of Antichriſt: but now ſaith hee (ſpeaking of the time after his conuerſion) my mind is

But they were of ſet purpoſe and malice tent from the other words and ſenſe of the writer, to make a ſhewe of that opinion which was neuer in M. Luther

reclaymed to the knowledge of the Goſpel. For in this place he ſpeaketh of a thirde cauſe of diuorce, when the woman ſhall obſtinately refuſe her huſbandes companie: & bringeth in the man often threatning his wife with theſe wordes, which if they preuayle not, hee maketh his complaynt to the Magiſtrates, and doeth nothing but after a ſolemne diuorcing, as was that of Vaſthi, and after a ſolemne eſpouſing,

If this opinion of diuorce ſeeme groſſe, as it may, yet your Poperie, whence this proceded, hath ſomewhat more groſſe euen in this poynt. For it permitteth a man if hee Pet. Lomb.

The like is alledged out of Auſten, to prooue that a man may bee diuorced from his wife for couetouſneſſe, or ſuch other ſinnes, becauſe they are ſpiritual fornication.

I ſuppoſe, to drawe out from you the iuſtification of this doctrine: for you cannot thinke that Chriſt perſwadeth all men to abſtayne from marriage: Seeing his wordes are not generally ſpoken to all whatſoeuer, but to alſuch as can containe▪

                        〈◊〉
                     . Cor. 7. 9. Paul inforceth. So that all Chriſtians,

which haue not that rare gift of continencie for auoyding of ſinne, are counſailed to marrie: all that haue the gift, for them it is more profitable many wayes to abſtayne. This Luther teacheth out of Chriſt and Serm. de matrim. 126. Paules doctrine, not to ouerthrowe virginitie, but to condemne your vngodly vowe of chaſtitie, without due examination, whether you haue the continent gift.
               8. The eyght report is lyke the former, Lib. de vot. coniu. et in aſſert. art. 16. 
                  making it as neceſſarie for euery man to haue a wife, as it is to eat, drinke or ſleepe. It is as neceſſarie for him that hath not the gift to marry for auoiding of ſinne, as it is to eate and drinke for auoyding of famine, that is not ſo dangerous as ſinne. When you drewe ſo deepe as theſe matters, you were deſirous rather to bryng nothing in deede then nothing in ſhewe.
               9. Your laſt report is, that M. Luther 
                  Luth. ſerm. de Trinit. ſhould make all Chriſtias as holy & as iuſt, as 
                        〈◊〉
                      mother of God, & as y• Apoſtles were. Theſe wordes are true in reſpect of Chriſt, in whome all the faythfull haue holineſſe, and honour equally, notwithſtanding there may bee inequallitie in their giftes, and in the meaſure of their glorie. I will not ſtande vpon the compariſons of theſe diſtinctions

ſeruing litle to edification: He Pſal. 84. 11. that is but a doore keeper in the houſe of God, the new Ieruſalem, hath infinite glorie. Apoc. 21. 2. Yet becauſe you make the virgin Marie and Apoſtles to beare more rule with Chriſt in heauen, then they dyd while they lyued vpon earth: Martin Luther teacheth vs, there is no ſuch reſpect of perſons with God: but in Chriſt Ieſus whether in heauen Act. 10. 34. or on earth, there is neyther Iewe nor Grecian, bond nor free, neither male nor female, Gal. 3. 28. Col. 3. 11. but we are all one in him. They haue all the ſame glorious inheritance, as they 2. Pet. 1. 1. had al like precious faith. For the diuerſity of meaſures I haue not bene a cōpanion of your baſtarde Denis in his iourney to heauen, to deſcribe the degrees and dignities there, or to determine that, which Chriſt referred Mat. 20. 23. to the determination of his Father, who ſhall ſit at his right hande in his kingdome, & who at his left. Thus I haue anſwered theſe places of M. Luther faithfully & without any of your bitterneſſe in ſcoffing and vaſſting at a vantage of nothing, as if you had thereby gayned the whole cauſe. By my anſwere it may appeare, theſe nyne places contayne no ſtraunge newe doctrine, as you haue reported without

that regarde of trueth or modeſtie which is pretended. But what is that you dare not write, to bryng the mans diuine and cleare doctrine into contempt, with as many as will be caried away with your ſmooth ſtile and bold accuſations: For, as not contented with theſe vntrueths, you woulde make y• reader beleeue, y• you leaue other infinite beaſtly doctrines of his, inuented by much cōference with the deuil, as you auouch the matter out of Lindan. But touching the broken and inſufficient credit of this Lindan & other your authors I haue noted ſomewhat before: and ſuch as your witneſſes are, ſuch are their teſtimonies alſo: the witneſſes not lawfull, and the teſtimonies not true. For Lindan, that hath here filled one page of your Cenſure, as a falſe witneſſe, writeth that the deuill

                  hath bene ſeene talke bodily with Martin Luther, by men of very great credit. The men are not named, nor the matter probable: therefore we may beholde a conſpiracie to leaue the matter, and diſgrace the man: one beginneth a ſlaunder, and the reſt come in, one after another to iuſtifie the ſame vpon that foremans credit. If we had no better teſtimonies, this practiſe woulde

bee as plentifull and ſtrong for vs as for you: but we haue not ſo learned Chriſt, neither Eph. 4. 20. doe we ſtande in neede of euill euidences to auow a good cauſe. But in this matter, becauſe you bryng in Luthers wordes againſt himſelf, to proue ſome part of your reporte, let vs ſee your miſconſtruing, brought for a defence of your miſreport. It is well knowen, M. Luther felt many tentations, and endured great conflictes with the enemie, which are very ſtrange to the moſt of your religion. Chriſt hath rendered the reaſon of your quiet, and godly mens diſquiet in this affliction of conſcience: when a ſtrong armed man, ſayth he, Luk. 11. 18. 
                  keepeth his Palace, the things are in peace which he poſſeſſeth. As long as Satā had Luther in poſſeſſion, kept in the chaynes of ignorance and ſuperſtition, hee felt not the malice of his ſpirituall enemie: Satan had no cauſe to diſquiet a ſuperſtitious man, whome hee had for the time in quiet holde: but when the Lord opened his eyes to ſee, and framed his heart to withſtande the kingdome of Satan and Antichriſt, the the enemie aſſailed him greuouſly, as himſelfe complaineth in many places. All which conflictes were not as you dreame, in an

outward or bodily conference with the deuill: but in thoſe inward battailes, in thoſe ſpirituall combates betweene the fleſh and the ſpirite, betweene the tentations of Satan and the deſires of the Newe men: ſuch as the Apoſtle noteth in diuers places. Gal. 5. 17. Ephe. 6. 12. Though the Ieſuites be not by experience acquainted with this greeuous whippe of God, wherewith he ſcourgeth many of his deare children, yet by reading they myght haue knowen what it meant. For Chriſt endured ſuch tentations

Wherefore you doe not onely in this ſlaunder intollerablie reproche Martin Luther, but you ſpeake euill alſo of the wayes of GOD, whereby hee worketh in the heartes of his children, true mortification and ſtrength in Ieſus Chriſt, to ouercome ſuch ſharpe Luc. 22. 31. and dangerous tentations. The treatiſe of Luther de miſſa angulari ſo oftē aledged by your felowes, I coulde neuer ſee, therefore it is as the allegation of his teſtimonie that is dead, or can not bee founde to giue in euidence face to face: when he is reuiued & commeth forth to beare witneſſe, he ſhall bee anſered. Touching Luthers death ſlaine (as you think) by y• deuil, going drunken to bedde ouernyght, you ſhoulde neuer haue diſ

his death, ſo you ſlaunder his life, ſaying that almoſt thirtie yeeres he liued in al ſenſualitie and pride. If there had beene any materiall argument, or ſome falſe witneſſe at hande, you would not haue come in your ſelfe all alone to be ſworne vpon this depoſition. That which you lay againſt him of diſſention, hath ſomewhat to be graunted. For (if you call it diſſention) he did altogether diſſent from Papiſts, being open enemies of the Goſpell: but for Occolampadius, Bucer, and others, although in ſome poynts they diſagreed, yet there was among them a ſingular care of vnitie in the Goſpell. Whereupon, beſide the entercourſe of many louing and godly letters, they ſet downe articles of agreement, ſubſcribing their names for a teſtimonie of their loue, as appeareth eſpecially by an acte of concord agreed vpon at Marburge: Actiones de concordia Marpurgae. 3. oct.

               A moſt patient mynde can not brooke a libell ſo ſeaſoned to itching eares.

But notwithſtanding Iam. 3. 15. all your cunning, if the reader ſtande vpon proofes; and not vpon bare ſpeach: if he ſtand vpon witneſſes of credit, and not vpon theſe falſe ſubdrued witneſſes, the matter will fall out againſt Layolas as a ſuperſtitious obſcure fellow: and for Martin Luther as a m

               The Cenſurer not ſatiſfied with al theſe vngodly iniuries againſt Martin Luther, now breaketh out into ſuch wordes of ſtomacke againſt M. Caluin, ſaying that the like life or worſe is written of him by a French man that liued with him ſometimes of the ſame religion. You take the beſt way throughout all your Cenſures to bring the men ſtill into ſuſpicion and hatred, becauſe you can effect no more againſt the cauſe. But for Maſt. Caluin, beſide ſo many as yet remaine aliue witneſſes of his godly and blameleſſe life, his writings ſhal teſtifie to all ages hereafter, that the Lorde raiſed him vp, as a ſinguler Miniſter of the Goſpel, and indued him with ſuch a ſpirit of wiſedome and learning, as may worthely kindle greater loue to him in godly mēs heartes, then is malice againſt him in your vncharitable ſpirites. The Lorde is moſt wiſe, and teſtifieth his loue in the diſpenſation

of his ſingular graces: So great giftes of true zeale, of an vnderſtanding heart, of a minde not ouercome with any ſeruice of the Church, with any labour for the brethren, are reall arguments, that, as the Lorde did ſanctifie and defende him againſt all the malice of his enemies while he liued, even againſt the fierie dartes of Satan: ſo now, though the man be layde vp in peace, yet the Lorde will preſerue his name in honour vpon the earth: and they that would bring ſhame vpon him, it ſhall light vpon them ſelues, as a iuſt recompence from him, who euermore preſerueth Deut. 32. 10. Zach. 2. 8. his ſaintes as the apple of his eye. Therefore it was no euill chaunce, but the Lords good will, that hitherto the tranſlation of your libel againſt him ſhould be ſuppreſſed.
               I maruaile how you paſſed by the ſtorie written againſt M. Bucer, ſeruing you ſo wel for this purpoſe. Seeing you haue left it out, I wil briefly note it for a proofe of my exceptions taken to Lindan, as to a ſhameleſſe lyer againſt the holy men of God. M.

Biſhops, as if they were careleſſe, what docttrine is deliuered vnto the people. For my ſelfe, I admitte not your compariſon betweene my writings & my preachings, as if I durſt bee bolder to faile in a Sermon, then in writing a booke, that may be diſcloſed. For, to anſwere alſo for my godly fellow miniſters, we preache as before 1. Tim. 3. 15. & 6. 3. God and Angels: and dare as little in their preſence preſume to preache otherwyſe then his worde giueth commiſſion, as wee dare to write otherwiſe before men then the trueth can allowe.
               Nowe followe the XIII articles of doctrine, wherewith the enemies of the trueth are charged, eſpecially the Ieſuites as the chiefe mainteiners thereof. And becauſe you offer your ſelues to bee holden guiltie of al other doctrines whereof you are accuſed, if theſe articles bee proued againſt you: I woulde haue you ſtande to your owne condition: for my part; I accept your concluſion to bee iudged as I haue dealt with the Ieſuites, in wel reporting or miſreporting their doctrine out of mine authour.
               
                  The firſt article out of the Ieſuites I blaſphemous doctrine, hath, as

                  not ſinne whatſoeuer is againſt the word of God. The report lieth vpon my authour (as I haue ſayde) yet you charge me with the wordes, as guylefully reported, as peeced and culled out for my purpoſe. But notwithſtanding this charge, you preſently acquite both mine authour and me, graunting the wordes to bee moſt true in their ſenſe. If they be in their ſenſe moſt true, why do you take any exception to my report, who onely lay them downe to yeelde what ſenſe you can make: Therefore before I wade any further, let me aſke you a queſtion or two. If any one of theſe XIII poyntes of doctrine bee falſe, why dyd you not playnely denie it? If they be all true, why dyd you not playnely graunt them? why dyd you wrangle, making them true and falſe, faſt and looſe, perfect and imperfect at your pleaſure? Through all your diſcourſe, doe you not playnely graunt them: and yet to helpe your owne credit, and to purchaſe agaynſt m

                  e ſome note of bad dealing, would you not ſeeme in ſome fort to denie them? But as this pretended deniall of thoſe articles was an iniurie to me, ſo the open mayntenaunce of them agayne

was your truſtie ſeruice toward the Ieſuites, and the couenant of your right hande. It was alſo ſafe dealing to graunt them, becauſe if you woulde deny any one of them in the playne ſenſe, wherein it is aduouched, yet the aduouchment ſhoulde bee proued agaynſt you by your owne recordes. Thus the good reader may ſee your dealing, that ſo accuſe mee, that ſo double and redouble the lie vpon mee, for laying downe nothing, but knowne groundes of popiſh doctrine, which you coulde not denie, and whereof the▪ Ieſuites haue lately vndertaken the principall defence.

Whatſoeuer they ſay, or Thomas of Aquine in this queſtion, you ſhall finde that iniuſtice is a ſinne, and yet no action: and that it is a ſinne as well not to doe the thing commaunded, as to commit the thing which is forbidden, which leauing of good offices vndone, you knowe is called the ſinne of omiſſion: and yet no action, as you woulde haue it. For Andradius diſtinction in this matter, is

The queſtion is altogether of the corruption, tranſgreſſion and ſinne which man c

For euill men as they are the creatures of GOD, are not againſt the Lawe, but the euill in men: not the deuils, but the corruption and euill in them: not euill lawes, as they commande, but yt euil in lawes, as it is either commanded or executed.

It followeth in the Ieſuites definition. Sinne is an humane or reaſonable action. I would not ſay, ſinne is an humane or reaſonable, but a beaſtly or vnreaſonable action of a man indued with reaſon. Yet in the Cenſurers iudgement, if a madde man or a foole kil a man, it is properly no ſinne: but theſe effects of ſinne, theſe great in

                     •
                   and other like enormities. Laſtly you ſay, in the definitiō of ſinne, it muſt be added, that it is a voluntarie action, & done wittingly. Al theſe additions are additions in deede, and lay open notable corruptions in your doctrine. For whatſoeuer is not of faith is ſinne, be it againſt thy Rom. 14. 23. will, or wt thy will, bee it an action or no action, be it reaſonable (as you ſpeake) or againſt reaſon. If this part of their definitiō were true, thē original ſin ſhould he no ſin, becauſe you cannot make it an action done willingly or wittingly. Moreouer, touching manſlaughter done vnwillingly or vnwittingly, and to one that is not hated, it De
                        ••
                     . 4. 43. may be anſwered, that hee that hath ſo killed a man muſt flee to the citie of refuge: if he be found from the bounds and liberties thereof, then the anenger of bloud may kill

him. Alſo he cannot depart from the Citie of refuge, till the death of the high Prieſt; Nomb. 35. 25 whoſe death ſeemeth herein in ſome ſort to prefigure the forgiuenes of his ſinne, in the death of Chriſt, the great high Prieſt. Laſtly Howlets booke acknowledgeth a ſin of ignorance againſt Chriſt the wiſedome of the Father: and hee maketh willing ſinne and wittingly committed, to come neere the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt. Thus betweene your doctrine and his, it will fall out that ſome ſinnes are no ſinnes: and againe, that all ſinnes are done wittingly, and therefore are in ſome ſort againſt the holy Ghoſt, & not eaſely remitted. Which doctrine condemneth all veniall ſinne, and leaueth no place for indulgences and Pardons: for al ſinne is wittingly and willingly done, ſayth the Cenſure: and all ſuch ſinnes are againſt the conſcience, and therfore damnable ſaith Howlets author. This is the harmonie and conſent of your doctrine, to mitigate the ſorowes of a weake conſcience wt many diſcordes placed in an euil concord. As for your example, that Iacob ſinned not in lying with Lea, becauſe 
                  Gen. 29. 23. 
                  he knewe it not, it is to make no ſinne of a double ſinne: for Iacob ſinned in iudgement,

not knowing what he did, and ſo ſinned, as vpon the like ignorance for want of regarde, hee might eaſily haue committed the fowleſt inceſt. Alſo it cannot bee proued that the bed was altogether vndefiled. To conclude therefore howſoeuer you alledge Auſten to approue your definition, it is no way ſo large as ſinne, and therefore a moſt vnlearned definition. You prouide for ſome way to eſcape by theſe your laſt woordes: And this is to bee vnderſtoode of actual ſinne properly, betweene properly and vnproperly, betweene actuall and not actuall, you thinke to finde a defence, becauſe the wordes may be diuerſly taken. But if euery thing repugnant to the lawe of God bee ſinne in deede, though not actuall, the queſtion is graunted, and nothing left to you, but a warre of woordes againſt the trueth.
               The contrary doctrine followeth: The tranſgreſſion of the lawe is ſinne. Howe 1. Iohn 3. 4. tauntingly & how ſcornefully, doth y• maſker play his part: Hee woulde make his reader beleeue I haue made a vowe not to deale plainly in any one thing, and that I can not alleadge one litle ſentēce without falſifying.

Alſo by your owne graunt, the Ieſuites of Colen, expreſſe thoſe wordes in effect ſaying: Albeit this concupiſcenſe doe ſtyrre or moue a man ſometimes to doe things which are repugnant to the lawe of God: yet if no conſent of heart bee yeelded vnto it, it reacheth not to the nature of a mortall ſinne, worthy of eternal damnation. That concupiſcenſe which doeth ſtyrre or moue a man to doe thinges againſt the lawe of GOD, is it not alſo it ſelfe agaynſt the law: As you thus graunt the words which before were denyed, ſo vnderhande, or at vnwares you graunt the matter wherwith you are charged. For, ſaying that concupiſcenſe without conſent, reacheth not to the nature of a mortall ſinne worthy of eternall damnation, in ſome ſorte you giue vs to vnderſtande, that it is neuertheleſſe ſome kind of ſinne, which is to graunt the queſtion, or to loade and diſguiſe the ſentence with many waſte woordes, that you may in ſo doing hide the errour. Moreouer you and the Ieſuites confeſſe concupiſcenſe to be ſinne, by Saint Paules manifeſt Rom. 7. 7. woordes, who as you graunt, ſometimes

calleth it ſinne. But as you wrangle with mee, ſo you miſconſter the Apoſtle, ſaying, hee meaneth not that it is a ſinne properly, but by a figure. Wherefore his large diſputation is ſhortly to bee layde downe, that thereby it may appeare, howe corruptly you interprete his meaning.
               The Apoſtle hauing declared, that the Lawe doth thorow our corruption worke in vs the luſtes & paſſions of ſinne, to meete with a doubt that might bee made againſt the law as if it were ſinne, becauſe through our rebellion it ſtirreth vs vp thereunto: anſwereth, ſaying, The Lawe is holy, and wee ſolde vnder ſinne: the Law ſpirituall Rom. 7. 12. 14. and we carnall. In which anſwere, it is diligently to be conſidered by the waye, that were it not holy, and the commaundement holy and iuſt, and good, euen the Lawe ſhould ſeeme to bee ſinne, for occaſion of ſinne that commeth thereby through our corruption. But this occaſion is not giuen by the Lawe, but altogether taken by our corruption rebelling againſt the commandement. So the Lawe being of it ſelfe holy altogether and giuen againſt ſinne, is not to be charged with our rebellion, which is ſinfull of it ſelfe, and prouoked by ſuch reſtraint.

had not made againſt the doctrine of concupiſcenſe without conſent. But I cite it for the former part of the propoſitiō, which ſufficiently proueth bare concupiſcenſe to bee ſinne. For if the conſent of the heart make concupiſcēſe to be adulterie, thē muſt concupiſcenſe it ſelfe be alſo ſinne: becauſe otherwiſe the conſent of the heart cannot make any lawful deſire to be adulterie: but Matt. 12. 3

The Apoſtles wordes in this place are full to make this proofe, calling it a mans owne luſt, or luſting: adding moreouer that a man is tempted therwith, drawen away, and as with a baite intited: which thinges can not bee in bare concupiſ

Therefore out of theſe woordes of Chriſt, it is truely proued, by the nature and effect of concupiſcenſe, that it is ſinne of it ſelfe, ſeeing preſently with conſent it is made a ſinne in ſo high a degree as is adulterie. Alſo herein, my alleadging of Scripture is founde to be according to the matter and argument, without any error of doctrine, alteration of ſenſe, or appiying it otherwiſe, then it may be truely and profitably applied: wherefore you gaue to much libertie to your penne, in charging mee with common miſalleadging of Scripture.

was far euen from the leaſt concupiſcenſe, I thinke in your owne iudgement. Therefore this your example of the pulſe to defende the firſt motions of luſt, is neyther in ſubſtance nor in ſhewe to any purpoſe. Moreouer you make the firſt motions of luſt no ſinne, becauſe it lyeth not in our power to prohibite them: by which reaſon you defende ſinne by the neceſſitie thereof. But ſeeing this neceſſitie commeth of our ſelues by our corruption and cuſtome of ſinne, how can it be any excuſe or defence for the treſpaſſe: what wil you ſay to originall ſinne, ſhall it be no ſinne becauſe it lyeth not in vs to reſiſt it, no more then we can reſiſt our owne conception, and is leſſe in our power to reſiſt then the pulſe: Like to the former compariſon of the pulſe is that which followeth, making the firſt motions of luſt to be no more ſinne in vs, thē they are in beaſtes. But this compariſon proueth no more the
                     •
                   the other: for as there is no law giuen to prohibit the pulſe: ſo there is no lawe to reſtraine theſe motions in beaſtes: but man is tyed to a lawe for euery action laſt or firſt, great or ſmall, as is proued by the great commandement: Thou ſhalt loue the Lorde thy God with 
                  Deut. 6. 5. Mat. 22. 37.
                  
                  all thy heart, and with all thy ſoule, and with all thy ſtrength, and with all thy mynde. So that what luſt or thought ſoeuer ſwarueth from this entire and abſolute loue of God, it is againſt this his commandement, and therefore a ſinne againſt his moſt ſoueraigne and moſt glorious Maieſtie, to whome wee owe all the ſeruice and holineſſe of all the heart, of all the mynde, and of al our powers whatſoeuer. Therefore to ſay wee muſt not or can not pull in the raynes of our firſt luſtes, or that they are as lawfull in vs. as the pulſe, or as they are in bruite beaſtes: is indeede to reache a beaſtly libertie and to laye open the way to all vncleanneſſe without controulement. Yf all your readers did knowe howe little proofe is made by ſimilitudes, they would all ſee the inſufficiencie of your defence, that ſo often vſe them, and ſo vnfitly, in place of playne and ſure arguments.
               Now for the tenth commaundement alledged as a contrary doctrine, yt Cenſurer Exod. 20. 17. ſayth it is not any way repugnant to that the Ieſuits teach. For proofe whereof as the Papiſtes make of the tenth commaundement two commaundementes, ſo this fellowe maketh of two ſeuerall breaches of

two diuers commaundementes, but one ſinne, and that agaynſt the ſeuenth commaundement onely. But there can not be a commaundement, agaynſt the which there is no ſinne. Therfore (as it was declared in the former article) there is a ſinneful deſire firſt, which is concupiſcenſe agaynſt the tenth, the aſſent whereunto maketh it adulterie, which is a ſinne of another degree, Matt. 5. 2
                        •
                     . and agaynſt the ſeuenth commaundement. So the Cenſurer muſt by duetie receyue home agayne his owne

                  ied awaye into errour by the olde tranſlation againſt the trueth, and other faithfull tranſlations, woulde proue that the lawe is in our power to doe it, and that therefore theſe firſt motions of luſte are not forbidden by the tenth commaundement, becauſe it is not in our power to reſiſt them. That his argument may appeare, I will ſet it downe to be more eaſily diſcouered. Whatſoeuer is commaunded, that is not aboue vs, but in our power: to reſiſt the firſt motions of luſt, is not in our power: therefore to reſiſt the firſt motions of

luſt is not commaunded. The firſt propoſition is falſe, and (as I ſaid) a falſe tranſlatiō brought to proue it. For Moſes ſaith, The Lawe is not hidden from vs, and the Deut. 30. 11. Cenſurer ſaith, It is not aboue vs: Moſes ſheweth, that it is reuealed, the Cenſurer would proue that it is in our power. Moſes ſpeaketh chiefly of the Goſpell, and the Cenſurer referreth it altogether vnto the tenne commandemēts. But that the place, is both to be tranſlated ſo, as I haue ſaide, and to bee applied to the reuelation of the Goſpell, it is euidently declared by the plaine text, and by the application thereof in the epiſtle to the Romanes. Thus the Rom. 10 6. firſt propoſition is falſe, and drawen both againſt the wordes of the text, and farre from the ſenſe thereof opened by the Apoſtle. The ſeconde propoſition is falſe alſo: for neither is it true, that all theſe firſt motions are altogether out of our power, for the gift of continencie and mortification Rom. 6. 2, 4, 14.

For your darke wordes out of Thomas, Howe the father vegate the ſonne, I wiſhe cleare and perfect woordes in ſo high a myſterie.

The reſt of theſe twelue points, as they are not euidently conteyned in the

woorde, ſo a Chriſtian is not abſolutely bounde to beleeue them: as that the common Creede (the articles whereof notwithſtanding we beleeue as grounded vpon the Apoſtolicall doctrine) was made by the Apoſtles: the celebration of Eaſter day vpon a Sunday: the perpetuall virgiuitie of the bleſſed Virgin. The Epiſtle to the Laodiceans, although many make mention of it, Paul maketh none: ſo that eyther you ignorantly paſſed ouer the Greeke, or wilfully addicted your ſelfe to the olde tranſlation, being in this place playnely corrupted. For by the originall, Paul ſpeaketh of an epiſtle frō Laodicea, and not written to the Laodicenſes, as you vntruely affirme.

In tranſlating, the propertie of euery tongue is to be obſerued: for as tongues differ in language, ſo they differ in their peculiar forme & order of words. That which may be well vnderſtoode in one tongue, muſt needes be ſupplied in an other. And to tranſlate word for worde, is to haue the wordes Engliſh or Frenche, when yet the phraſe ſhall remaine Greeke or Hebrewe, and be as litle vnderſtoode. Yet this is that obſcure and fruiteleſſe tranſlation which the Cenſurer exacteth at my hand. But let vs ſee how iuſtly.

But it may be, he hateth the kingdome and ſkill of Grammarians. Thus much to anſwere my tranſlation which you haue ſo vnlearnedly marked, and ſo vniuſtly cōdemned. Now it foloweth to conſider what you bring agaynſt the alleadging of that place to reproue the Ieſuites doctrine, and your vnwritten verities.
               Your firſt reaſon, y• this place is not full ynough to proue y• ſufficiencie of y• Scripture, for which it is alleaged, ſtandeth vpon and word in y• text, where the Apoſtle ſaith, the Scripture is profitable, and hath not the worde ſufficient. But you ſay theſe are two diuers thinges, to bee ſufficient for a purpoſe, and to be profitable for it, as may appeare in meate which is profitable for our lyfe, yet wee cannot ſaye it is ſufficient, becauſe it alone, without naturall heate, clothes and other meanes ſufficeth not. Whereupon you leaue the reader to conclude that this place is too ſlender for my purpoſe. The force of which your reaſon is of the difference of theſe two words,

affirming that profitable, is not ſo much as ſufficient. Whereunto I anſwere, that as ſometimes it is true which you affirme, and as it appeareth in your example: ſo of the other part it is true, that many times a thing may be ſaide profitable for a purpoſe, where profitable ſhal import ſufficient and not barely profitable: as for example, when ſome reaſon is adioyned why it ſhoulde be profitable and nothing elſe applyed or ſeruing to that effect. For proofe hereof when the Apoſtle writeth that Godlines is profitable to all things hauing the promiſes of

                     . Tim. 4. 8. 
                  this life & of the life to come: it can not be denyed, but by profitable here, he meaneth it is ſufficient for all things: that is for the obteyning of all good thinges: which ſenſe of this worde is prooued by that which followeth of the effect, hauing the promiſes of both lyues. For if godlineſſe bryng all good things of this lyfe and of the lyfe to come, it muſt needes folowe that the Apoſtle ſaying, it is profitable to all things, vnderſtoode it was ſo fully ſufficient, that hee which hath it, needeth not the ſupplie of any thing elſe. For like reaſon in this place, I ſay, the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Scripture, as profitable for doctrine for confutation,

for correction and reformation, by profitable, vnderſtandeth ſufficient. If your example were of the like, it woulde proue the ſame. If as meate and drinke are profitable to nouriſh, ſo they were profitable alſo to cloth, to giue reſt and to make a man perfectly healthie and ſtrong to euery good action: I woulde alſo conclude vpon ſuch cauſes that it were both profitable and ſufficient to mayntaine life. But you ſtande in neede of an other Cenſurer, to Cenſure your compariſons and examples ſo often brought in, eaſily to dereyue the reader, that doth not ſee howe vnequallie they are yoked, as like thinges to make like proofe, being in deede vnlike and of vnlike effectes. To returne vnto the text, the ſufficiencie of ſcripture is moreouer prooued by the wordes which got before and followe. Before the Apoſtle had ſayde that all the Scripture is inſpired of God: whereupon he inferreth, and is profitable to teach for doctrine and confutation: as if he had ſayde, it is profitable to teache the trueth and reproue errour. The ſtrength of which reaſon lyeth in this, that the light of knowledge which ſometime was in man by his creation, is damped and gone out: ſo

that nowe wee haue no meanes (except God by his holy Spirite doeth inſpire vs) to diſcerne betweene trueth and vntrueth, or betweene good and euill. Nowe this heauēly knowledge, which (as Saint Peter ſayeth) was vttered by the holy men of 2. Pet. 1. 21. God, inſpired with the holy Ghoſt, is recorded in the bookes of holie Scripture. Whereupon it foloweth that theſe bookes of the holy worde, and no other, being the authenticall words of the heauenly knowledge, which God inſpired the holy Prophets and Apoſtles withall, are ſo ſayde to be profitable to teache the trueth, as it noteth this to bee proper to the holy Scripture, and not to agree to any other whatſoeuer. Therefore if theſe bee the writings which contayne the wiſedome, wherewith God hath inſpired his holy men, for ſuch vſe of the Church, as is here ſpoken of, it muſt needes followe, the knowledge which God hath reuealed, being ſufficient for vs, that theſe holy Scriptures conteining the ſame knowledge, is lykewiſe ſufficient. Whereby it appeareth that this cauſe here noted, (to witte of inſpiration from God) being the proper cauſe of the holy Scriptures, and not common to any other writings

whatſoeuer, doeth implie the effect alſo folowing in this place, of teaching, diſprouing and making perfecte the man of God, to be likewiſe proper vnto them: and (which I vndertoke to proue) profitable in this place to ſignifie as much as ſufficient.
               
               To this I adde an other reaſon out of the wordes which followe: wherein becauſe not ſome things onely which may in parte make a man perfect, are attributed to the ſcriptures, and ſome other thinges left to bee ſupplied by other meanes: but all things whatſoeuer may bee needefull for vs, are ſayde to be perfected by the Scriptures, it muſt needes follow, that the ſcripture alone is ſufficient. For that which is profitable to al the partes, which may be required to perfection, cannot be but ſufficiēt for the perfection of the whole: but that the Scripture is profitable in ſuch maner, the Apoſtle doth fully declare, both in rehearſing all the particular partes which are neceſſarie, and adding alſo after generally, that the man of God may be perfect. To this purpoſe the Apoſtle hath ſo ſet his wordes, as hee could not more effectually by any other ſpeach. For he teacheth, that it

is profitable to make perfect, which yet is 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . made more full by the compound worde adioined, the grace and force of which compoſition (as was noted before) is to note perfection added to perfection, and to ſignifie throughly, or perfectly perfect, and that, as hee addeth, for all good workes. This is yet made more full and more waightie by that hee ſpeaketh not here of the cōmon perfection of all men, but of the perfection of the man of God, that is of the Miniſter. If the ſcripture conteine knowledge to make the Miniſter throughly perfect, for euery part of his office, both in doctrine ſoundly to teach the trueth, and to confute and remoue error: and in life to reforme and correct that which is amiſſe, and to inſtruct in that which is righteous and holy, how much more is it ſufficient for the cōmon knowledge of other men, in whom like perfection of vnderſtanding is not ſo much required.
               To theſe two reaſons, becauſe the queſtion is of importance, I will yet adde one other out of the verſe next going before. There the Apoſtle vſeth an argument to perſwade Timothy to abide in y• doctrine of the holy Scriptures, for proofe of which

argument, this ſeuēteenth verſe is immediatly adioyned. His argument is takē from the effect of theſe holy writings, wherein Timothie had been brought vp frō a child. Which effect is this, that through faith in 
                  2. Tim.

                  Chriſt Ieſus they are of abilitie or of power, or of ſufficiencie to make him wiſe to ſaluation. For the Apoſtle ſayeth expreſſely, that the Scriptures are able, or of power, or ſufficiencie (for all theſe ſpeaches I take to bee of one ſignification) whereunto: to make him wiſe: how farre: euen to ſaluation, that is to teache him all wiſedome needeful to ſaluation. Whereupon, as I ſayd, the Apoſtle immediatly bringeth in this ſentence, that All the Scripture is giuen by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, &c. Which muſt either be ſayde to bee impertinent to the former matter of the power or ſufficiencie of the Scripture to ſaluation (which I thinke no man of any reaſon will affirme) or els it muſt be confeſſed, that the Apoſtle added it for greater plainnes, or for an other proofe. For whether of both it be brought in, it is abſurde to bring the leſſe to ſet out, or proue the more. And ſeeing the Apoſtle had ſpoken in the former verſe of the ſufficiencie

of Scripture, to ſaye nowe it bringeth but ſome profite to that purpoſe, were to ſaye leſſe then he had ſaid before. Wherefore he ſaying it is profitable, ſetteth it out as alone and ſufficiently profitable, being inſpired of God, and ſanctified by his promiſe and ordinance, to make perfect the man of God to al heauenly wiſedome. Finally, the Apoſtle hauing put into Tiniothies hande al compleat, neceſſarie and ſufficient furniture, ſpeaketh neuer a whit of your churchreuealed verities, but onely of the ſcripture inſpired of God. Therefore either he teacheth and concludeth inſufficiently: or els the Scripture is ſufficiently, wholly, powerfully, and in trueth onely profitable.
               For your ſecond reaſon, I denie that the newe Teſtament is therefore ſuper fluous, becauſe the olde was ſufficient. For this bountifull addition, or acceſſe of ſcripture by the Newe Teſtament, is not to impeach the perfection and profitable ſufficiencie, or ſufficient profitablenes of the olde Teſtament, ſeeing the Fathers were aſwell faued, as we are now vnder the Goſpell, but for a more full, euident, and cleare reue

                  ation of that, which though to ſaluation it was ſufficient before, yet could not ſhewe

the infinite riches of Gods goodneſſe toward vs, ſo plainely & ſo fully as theſe doe. Iob had ſufficient in his greateſt want, and no ſuperfluitie in his greateſt aboundance, A morning light is ſufficient for a man to doe his worke by, yet the brightneſſe of the ſunne is not therefore needeleſſe and ſuperfluous: for it ſerueth to giue a clearer, a more certaine and more comfortable direction then the other. For your by matter, that the wordes omnis and tota, differ in Greeke and Latine, for proofe wherof you appeale to all Logicioners, I dare warrant you they will all condemne your opinion. For omnis homo ſignifieth euery man, but omnis populus (which is the Vulgar tranſlation) doth not ſignifie euery people:

Therefore if you can ſalue this matter of manifeſt errour, I will acknowledge my ſelfe to deale deceitfully as you charge me. An other point followeth like the reſt already anſwered. But the Cenſurer thus repeateth. Saint Paul

muſt vnderſtand part of the ſcripture and not the whole, becauſe all was not then written: alſo nowe wee can not take the Apoſtles wordes as vttered of all, becauſe much ſcripture is now wanting as he doth imagine. Should theſe be your plaine arguments if you could obteine diſputation: Should this be the ſhorter waye? I know not your name, but know I pray you and teach your fellowes to knowe, that the ſcripture hath bene in all ages ſufficient for the time wherein it was written: of all that which hath by ſeuerall encreaſes bene written, nothing was at any time ſuperfluous: and whatſoeuer hath bene written and not come to our handes, nothing for all that is now miſſing, that is neceſſary vnto ſaluation. He that hath not giuen vs the bookes of Nathan, Gad, Achia the Shilonite, and

this in the concluſion of his Goſpell, and Chriſt teacheth that they which had Moſes and the Prophets, euen then had Luke 15. 20. ſufficient without miracles and traditions. And you haue no ſound opinion of the wiſdome and mercie of God, if you thinke his maieſtie to leaue any age, ſince he choſe a peculiar people, voide of ſcripture, profitable and ſufficient to the ſaluation of his Church. Thus the reader may ſee that I neither wreſt the former place agaynſt my ſelfe, neither can you doe it, that would ſo faine.
               
                  In the fifth article the Ieſuites are reported to ſay, The want of holy ſcriptures 
                  V 
                  muſt be ſupplied by peecing it out 
                  Cenſ. Col. 220. 
                  by traditions. For the report of this doctrine, the Cenſurer beſtoweth more of his vndeſerued tauntes. If the Cenſure of Colen hath no ſuch wordes, Gotuiſus failed in citing their booke, but failed not in charging them with their owne doctrine, which all Ieſuites and Papiſtes ſo vpholde as Peters chaire, both to mainteine their falſe doctrines, and to vnderſet their Antichriſtiā tyraunie. But although you would for the time diſſemble the matter, traditiōs are not of ſo ſmal force, as to peece out the

want of ſcripture. For, except the Preſidēt of ye Trent council haue a forge to coyne lies, traditions are a liuing Goſpel: and hee vttereth it as a queſtion that can not be denied. Hoſius lib. 4. de. trad. 
                        •
                     ol. 388. 
                  This is moſt true (ſaith Hoſius) that if traditions be reiected, the very Goſpell alſo ſeemeth to be reiected: for what els are traditions, then a certaine liuing Goſpell? In deede traditions make a quicke court at the Vaticane. Thus by your doctors opinion it is moſt true, y• traditions are made not a ſupplie to any wants in y• Goſpel, but an other liuing Goſpel, after a ſort to giue life to that which in y• true Goſpell ſeemeth to be dead. And may not a man wt

For Moſes in the ſame Chapter, ſpeaking of the ſame lawe and to the ſame men, doth change the plurall number into the ſingular. The ſelfe ſame Lawe alſo is recited in the ſingular number in the twelfth chapter of Deuteronomie, & by Salomon, in the thirtieth chapter of his Deut. 12. 32. Prouerbes: and euermore that which is P

cannot gueſſe what you unagined at this change of the Lawgiuers wordes, without change of the ſenſe, being done by the example of the ſame Lawgiuer in another place, and without any breach of his Lawe: and wherupon your vttermoſt malice could inferre none abſurditie in ſenſe, none iniurie to the ſcripture, nor aduantage to my cauſe, but a ſtinging gueſſe inſinuating ſome cauſe mouing mee to this change, which whether you cōcealed as forbearing me, or aſhamed on your own behalfe to bewraye, the indifferent reader iudgeth. Againe, what made you adde ſo haynous a ſlaunder, as if all thinges were lawfull for me: and to charge me, as blaming the Apoſtles and Euangeliſtes for adding the Goſpel? Take heede you allowe not your ſelfe ſuch ſcope in theſe ſuggeſtions manifeſtly agaynſt the trueth and your owne conſcience, for you knowe what that ſentence implieth, Bleſſed is he that condemneth 
                  Rom. 14. 22. 
                  not himſelfe in that thing which hee alloweth. The Lorde that addeth grace to grace, and light to light, he alſo hath added to the lawe, the fulneſſe and ſatiſfaction Rom. 10. 4. 1. Tim. 3. 16. thereof in Chriſt Ieſus, which is publiſhed in his moſt holy and moſt perfect Goſpell.

To expounde Moſes wordes, forbidding 
                  Deut. 4. 2. 
                  to adde or take away from the Lawe as ſpoken of the things he deliuered by word of mouth, and not of the lawe written, 
                     〈◊〉
                   is a doubtfull ſpeaking, and may beare a harder concluſion, then I will charge you with. His cōmandement reſpected the law eyther pronounced or written by him,

                   afterwarde to bee preached and written by the holy Prophets and Apoſtles in the ſpirite of God. I dare appeale to your conſcience, though it be deliuered from your pen, you do not thinke in your heart, that I woulde haue no ſcriptures beleeued, beſides that which Moſes ſet downe. Wherfore your proofe needed not in this matter. To conclude, it is a great iniquirie to adde traditions, or your unwritten ve

                  In the ſixth place the Ieſuites wordes VI Cenſ. Col. 117. are thus reported: The holy Scripture is a noſe of waxe. At the true report of this blaſphemous doctrine, you fall into a

ſtorme, perſwading that I haue therein ſinned agaynſt God and abuſed the Ieſuices, with other moſt bitter woordes: as if I tooke the way to ouermatch both learning and trueth. But howe wrongfully all theſe woordes are caſt out againſt me, your owne wordes beare witneſſe: for preſently after the ſentence of condemnation, you repeale it and acquite me of the fault: graunting, that as a noſe of waxe, may bee formed what way and to what forme one liſt, ſo naughtie men may wreſt the Scriptures. Notwithſtanding, becauſe you preſſe the wordes againſt me, let them be examined. Firſt to proue that the Ieſuites haue them more plainely then you will acknowledge, I appeale from your Cenſure, to Andradius playne confeſſion. Hee (as you knowe) defended the Ieſuites in theſe poyntes agaynſt Kemnitius, which you defende againſt mee: and hath lent you no ſmall furniture for this ſeruice. This Andradius (as hauing more learning, and in his kinde more true dealing then you) in handling this article, doth not at all cry out as you doe, but acknowledgeth and defendeth the matter without ſuch needeleſſe ſcoffes. And for the words he confeſſeth ſaying: The fathers of Colen

euen that high and infinite wiſdome it ſelfe, by making ſuch reſtraintes and taking ſuch ſure wayes to debarre the children of God, from the moſt neceſſary euidences of their heauenly inheritance. But in this queſtion Pſal 18. 8, 10. &c. & 119. 129. agayne, Payua doth deale more plainely to the purpoſe then the Cenſurer, who borowing of Payua this place alſo, yet leaueth out all that, which maketh not to his purpoſe, of couering and ſhielding the Ieſuites from the trueth that fighteth againſt them. For Andradius plainely confeſſeth, that this is the firſt argument of the Ieſuites, why the Scriptures ſhould not be read, becauſe (as the Ieſuites teach) they 
                  Paiuas Andrad. lib 2. orthodox. expl. pag. 117. 
                  haue giuen occaſion to all hereſies. A very ſtrange aſſertion: but howſoeuer vnlearned and vnſtable men deale, yet the Scripture giueth no occaſion of hereſie, much leſſe of all hereſies, as theſe fellowes doe thus openly maintaine. Therefore the Ieſuites, in teaching that ſuch harme commeth by reading the word of God, accuſe the ſcriptures as hurtful many wayes, and not profitable, which is aſmuch as they are charged withall in the 7. place. The Cenſurer commonly faileth in leauing the queſtion, and prouing that which is not

called into doubt: as in this place bee proueth that the worde is without all fault, when men miſconſter it, or founde hereſies vpō the miſunderſtanding of it. This was not in queſtion: yet it is wel prooued 
                     〈◊〉
                   fitly to ouerthrowe the former doctrine of Ieſuites: for, if the ſcripture be in no fault, teſtraine not the Scripture, but reforme the wrangling and peruerting wit: if it be in no fault, it is neither the occaſion of all hereſies, nor a noſe of waxe. Your exāple of Chriſt is eaſely & truely returned againſt you. For as Chriſt is a ruine to none, but Pſal. 11

Alſo by that interpretation his wondeful workes, & moſt heauenly doctrines, ſhall bee made to vs nothing els, but a bare and naked ſtorie, to tell vs what Chriſt taught others, and not what he hath taught vs: and to declare what hee reprehended in them, not what he reprehendeth in vs. But the Cenſurer will anſwer

And why not any other ſentence aſwell as this to the Sadduces? for nothing can be more generall then errour, nothing more vniuerſall then the ignorance of Scriptures; which is I thinke, in y• Cenſurers iudgement the fountaine of all errour. How commeth it then that he will ſtop ſo generalle ſtreame, reſtrayning that to a fewe, which apper
                     •••
                  
                  neth to all: And for the Sadduces; they

did not only erre in the doctrine of y• reſurrection, but were otherwiſe enemies, & ignorant of Chriſt, not knowing the Scriptures, 
                  Mat. 16. 6. Actes 5. 7. 
                  nor the power of God to ſaluatiō in him. Wherfore Chriſt noted vpō one particular occaſion, y• fountaine of al their blindneſſe and infidelitie, as well as the cauſe of their ignorance, touching the reſurrection, & their fooliſh doubt of the ſeuen brethren. Thus, notwithſtāding y• Cenſurers iudgement, it is plaine, that the doctrine of this place hath aſwel a general vſe as a particular: & that Chriſt noted the fountaine of all ignorance, & not the ignorance of Sadduces touching reſurrection alone.
               To your ſeconde point, that Chriſt ſpake not this to the people, but to y• learned Sadduces, firſt I anſwere, If the learned erre, not knowing the ſcriptures: the vnlearned are in more danger of errour through the ſame want. Secondly, if the want were not noted in all, the ſupplie ſhoulde not be made and commanded to all: but all, euen the people are commaunded to ſearch the Scriptures, therefore Iohn 5. 3
                        •
                     . not to ſearch them, or to bee ignoraunt of them, is a fault in al, be they learned or vnlearned. Your argumēt that Chriſt ſhoulde

ſpeake onely to the Sadduces, and of the reſurrection becauſe it is added, you know not the power of God, is alreadie anſwered: for it is a generall fault, aſwell to bee ignorant of the power of God, as not to knowe the Scriptures. Therefore as the ignorance of the one is condemned in all, ſo is the ignorance of the other, and the remedie for both is found in the exerciſe and ſearch of the holy ſcriptures. Your ſimilitude of woordes ſpoken as by my Lorde Chauncellor to the doctors of the Arches, is vnlearned, for with an example of ſpeach concerning a ſpeciall matter, you would ouerthrow that which was ſpokē by Chriſt, of a generall cauſe. But let your example ſtande: As the ſtudie of the ciuill lawe is proper to all Lawyers: and therefore their lawe bookes to bee read and ſtudied of all Lawyers: ſo the ſtudie of the ſpirituall and heauenly Lawe, is the profeſſion of all chriſtians, Actes. 17. 1
                        •
                     . and therefore the bookes of that law to be read and ſtudied by all profeſſors of the ſame, becauſe to erre, not knowing the Scriptures, is a thing common to all men, as was declared. An example of the lyke had bene nothing for your purpoſe: as if my Lorde Chauncellor ſhould ſay to ſome

Ieſuites, Yee runne into daunger of treaſon, not knowing the Law againſt al thoſe that withdrawe the Queenes ſubiects from their naturall obedience to her Maieſtie: this ſhould be a note not only to thoſe Ieſuites, but to al whatſoeuer they be, Ieſuites, or Seminaries or maſſeprieſtes, or what perſons ſoeuer, y• they muſt eyther knowe and keepe the lawe, or incurre the puniſhment therein expreſſed agaynſt the offenders. Vſe good wordes of your countreymen: clowne them not, for though they bee ſimple, and not trayned in the ſtudie of good letters, yet they haue ſoules to bee fed with the woord: and (howſoeuer you Hoſius de aut. ſcrip. lib. 3. pag. 253. Iac. Noguer. de eccle. Chriſti lib. 1. pag 69. Mat. 22. 29. prayſe the Colliers fayth, and would put it in execution) they are to take heede they find not Chriſts word verefied againſt thē aſwell as againſt y• Sadduces.

                  Cenſ Col. 118.

referre you to my author, whoſe wordes being truely reported, the charge you laye vpon mee is cauſeleſſe, and muſt returne. But what is this, ſtil to denie the articles, to mayntaine quarell: and yet to auowe the doctrine to defende the Ieſuites: Your owne wordes teache that a mans workes are meritorious in Chriſt, and meanes to make him righteous with the ſeconde righteouſneſſe, as you call it: which is playnely to graunt the doctrine denyed before. For although you vſey• name of Chriſt in this queſtion, yet the Apoſtle cōcludeth, that you impute your ſaluation not to Chriſt, but to your owne workes. I teſtifie, ſayeth the Apoſtle, (ſpeaking of them that dyd not exclude Chriſt) that if yee bee circumciſed, Chriſt doeth nothing profit you: Gal. 5. 2. teaching thereby, that whoſoeuer will in any part bee righteous in them ſelues, can haue no righteouſneſſe in Ieſus Chriſt. Therefore there was no cauſe of your impudent lyes.
               
               You come next to the place auouched for confutation of this errour: If righteouſneſſe 
                  Rom. 11. 6. 
                  come by our workes, it is not nowe grace. This ſentence you truely conſter as alledged by mee to prooue that no

man: 
                     〈◊〉
                   can bee ryghteous in this life: which you ſay is both from the purpoſe and falſe. But if the woordes be ful of proofe, to ſhewe there is no righteouſneſſe in mans woorkes, if it be the manifeſt doctrine of the Apoſtle, what coulde more fitly conuince the blaſphemie, derogating from the righteouſneſſe which is by Chriſt, and arrogating to our owne workes, then that place which ſheweth, there is no righteouſneſſe in our workes, but in Chriſt alone, which is imputed to vs by grace onely: Nowe let vs ſee how falſe it is. This you woulde proue by a diſtinction of a double righteouſneſſe, the firſt of being called from infidelitie to gayth in Chriſt, which you ſay is onely of Gods mercie, and nor by any merit of our workes: the ſeconde righteouſneſſe is of ſuch workes as proceede from men after the former calling, if they remayne in grace. But if this reede whereupon you leane, be broken, you muſt needes confeſſe the former proofe againſt you to be both pertinent and true. For this Gen. 27. 38. Heb. 12. 16. Act. 4. 12. purpoſe it is to be conſidered, that as there was but one bleſſing ſhewed to Iſaac, ſo there is but one onely righteouſnes, which is not founde in any perſon or ſubiect, but

in our Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus alone. This righteouſneſſe is accounted and imputed 1. Cor. 1. 30, Phil. 3. 9. to all thoſe that beleeue as their owne. In which imputation it is needefull to conſider the proportion betweene yt redeemer, & his redeemed, for it giueth great light to this queſti
                     •
                  . As in Chriſt there was found no cauſe of death at al, & yet hee died onely Iohn 19. 4. 1. Cor. 15. 3. Rom. 5. 6. by imputation of our ſin: ſo in vs there is foūd no cauſe of life at al, & yet we ſhal liue onely by imputation of his righteouſnes. The like proportion is betweene the couenant in the law and the couenant of faith in Chriſt: for as y• law admitteth no tranſgreſſion, if a man will liue by it: ſo Chriſt admitteth Pſal. 14. 1. Rom. 3. 10. Gal. 3. 22. Deut. 27. 26. Gal. 3. 10. Gal. 5. 3. no ſatiſfaction or merit to ioyne 
                     〈◊〉

                  eouſnes of Rom. 1. 17. God: and ſaid to be that which is reuealed in the Goſpell. This is the righteouſneſſe of faith, as the Apoſtle proueth out of the Prophet, witneſſing that the righteous mā 
                  Gal. 3. 11. Habac. 2. 4.
                  
liueth by faith which place proueth there is but one righteouſneſſe of men, not onely becauſe the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of it as one: but in naming it expreſſely the righteouſneſſe of God, and giuing to this faith both righteouſneſſe and life. For if the righteouſneſſe of faith, be the righteouſneſſe of God, that is, ſuch as God accompteth for righteouſneſſe, which may alſo ſtand before him, and make vs holy in his ſight, what ſecond righteouſneſſe can there be, or what can it doe before God, that is not already accompliſhed by that firſt righteouſneſſe▪ Moreouer if this righteouſneſſe bee that which the Goſpell teacheth, and not the Goſpell only, but, as the ſame Apoſtle writeth afterward, which is teſtified by the law and the Prophets, whēce haue you brought Rom. 3. 2

                  Act. 4. 12. Matt. 26. 39. Heb. 5. 9. for ſinne, nor perfectly to keepe the Lawe but he alone) therefore there can 
                     •
                  ee but one righteouſneſſe, which is in Chriſt Ieſus, & accompted vnto thoſe which beleeue in him according to the Goſpell. The holy Apoſtles teach that after men be conuerted from infidelitie to faith, they ſtande righteous and liue in the ſight of God, not by meanes of their woorkes, but by this faith whereby they beleeued. Abrahams example maketh this good, who after he was called from idolatrie to the ſeruice of God, is ſaid to haue beleeued, and that his faith was reckoned to him for righteouſneſſe: not his workes firſt or laſt, leaſt hee might haue Gen. 15. 6. Rom. 4. 3. Gal. 3. 6. wherein to reioyce and not in God. The Apoſtle to the Galathians, maketh this euident. We knowing, ſaith he, that a man is not iuſtified by the works of the Law, but by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt, we alſo haue 
                  Gal. 2. 16. 
                  beleeued in Ieſus Chriſt, that we may bee iuſtified by the faith of Chriſt, and not by

workes of the Law, becauſe by the works of the Lawe no fleſh ſhalbe iuſtified. In which words the Apoſtle plainely maketh ſaluation an effect of faith, and not of any workes, which we do after wee haue beleeued. Our ſauiour Chriſt confirmeth this in diuers places, as in Ioh: He that beleeueth 
                  Ioh. 5. 24▪
                   
                  in him that hath ſent me, hath euerlaſting life, & ſhal not come into condēnatiō, but is already paſſed from death to life: &, He that beleeueth in the ſonne, hath life euerlaſting. 
                  Idem. 3. 36. An other place to the Galathians, maketh all this yet more manifeſt: where the Apoſtle ſpeaking of himſelfe long after his conuerſion ſaith, That I nowe liue, I liue by the faith of him that loued me, and 
                  Gal. 2. 2

                  gaue him ſelfe for me. By theſe proofes it is euident, that there is but one onely righteouſneſſe, for which men are accompted righteous before him, which is the righteouſnes of faith. To this may be added, that the only righteouſnes of God is that, which giueth all the glorie of our ſaluation to God only in Chriſt Ieſus, and ſhutteth out 1. Cor. 1. 31. 2. Cor. 10. 17 all vaunting and boaſting of man: but the ſecond righteouſnes, which you imagine, doth not ſo, but Ieaueth ſomewhat for man to glory of: therefore it is no righteouſnes Iere. 9. 23. Rom. 4. 2.

To ſhewe the force of this aſſurance, the Apoſtle vſeth very ſignificatiue words, calling it a ſure and ſtable ancre: and yet to make it ſo full that no feare or doubt may remayne, he addeth that it entreth into the inwarde of the Vaile, whereunto Chriſt is entred, meaning thereby the heauens. Which importeth as much as if hee ſhoulde ſay, we that haue caſt this Ancre aboue in heauen, are ſo much more ſafe, then they whoſe Ancre is caſt downe into the Sea, as the holde wee haue taken in heauen by the Ancre of hope, is ſurer. Yea, the very Rockes ſhal ſooner faile, thē our hold, ſettling vpon the ſtrength & truth of gods promiſe, which are al Yea & Amē in Chriſt 2. Cor. 1. 20. Ieſus. This our ſhoote Ancre of hope, hath taken holde of the mercy ſeate of God, and of the throne of grace, which except ſome Heb. 4. 16. ſtorme be able to remoue, wee are in moſt ioyfull and ſtedfaſt ſafetie.
               The like is promiſed by ye other place out of ye fifth to the Romanes: for, if hope maketh not aſhamed, and ſhame commeth Rom. 5. 5. when a man faileth of that be hoped for: then hope can not faile. The Apoſtle maketh this more ſtrong by that which foiloweth as a reaſon, The loue of God is aboū
                     danly

ſhead out into our hearts by the holy Ghoſt which is giuē vnto vs. By which reaſon it appeareth, except the holy Ghoſt hath giuen vs a wrong teſtimonie of the loue of God, the hope which we haue conceiued thereby cannot deceiue vs. Thus you ſee theſe places ſo truely and fitly alledged, that al your falſely named learning will not be able truely to anſwere the allegation of them, which notwithſtanding it pleaſeth you to call vnlearned. But let vs ſee what you call learning: forſooth the doctrine of Ieſuites, touching the doubtfulnes and feare which is in hope, that is true, learned and cleare. This is (as the prophet complaineth) to call good badde, and Eſa. 5. 20. ſweete ſower: whereunto you know what belongeth.
               For aunſwere to theſe two places of hope, the Ieſuite
                     •
                   doctrine is declared at large, the effect of all ſtanding in two pointes: the firſt concerning faith, the other of hope. Of faith they teach, that no man may beleeue that he in particular ſhalbe ſaued without a particular reuelatiō from God. A faithleſſe doctrine of faith: and therefore not to bee lightly paſſed ouer. You ſeeme to proue it by reaſons, one

drawen from yt 
                  obiect of faith, which is the word written, or tradition, whereof neither as you ſay, doeth teſtifie mens ſaluation in particular: the ſeconde taken from the vncertaintie of the things beleeued: which (as the Cenſurer ſuppoſeth) doe depende vpon ſuch conditions as poſſibly may not be perfourmed. Both theſe great points, for want of ſcripture he ſetteth foorth by examples, as minding rather to perſwade then to proue. The firſt is of the anſwerer: the ſeconde of the poſſibilitie to be damned, as did fall out in Iudas, and may fall out (a more Mat. 27. 5. Act. 1. 18. fearefull caſe then I woulde put of him. had bee not put it of him ſelfe) in the Cenſurer him ſelfe. Nowe let vs conſider, what great learning the Ieſuices haue in this their opiniō of faith, as the Cenſure

                   doth report them. To iudge, that without particular reuelation by name, no man can be ſure of his ſaluation, is expreſſely againſt that the woorde of God

                   ſoeuer the Ieſuites make them ſelues, yet in deede as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the wiſe 1. Cor. 1. 20. Gentiles, they become ſtarke fooles, not knowing true wiſedome out of the worde, but baſtard wiſedome by their fooliſh diſtinctions.

The Cenſurers worde of Tradition muſt bee reſerued for a fitter place. Touching the promiſe of the Goſpell, it is Mar. 16. 1

This generall promiſe hath place, and is certainely verefied in euery particular yt beleeueth. Euery ſenſible mā without further learning may eaſely iudge in this doctrine: whatſoeuer is true in ye general, muſt needes be true in euery particular. Nowe, if it be vndoubtedly true, that euery beleeuer ſhalbe ſaued, it muſt needes bee alſo, that Simeon and Lazarus beleeuing in Chriſt ſhalbe ſaued. Therefore what needeth any ſpeciall reuelation in the worde, for that which is ſufficiently comprehended vnder the generall: what neede is there by name to ſaye from mā to man by name, Lazarus ſhalbe ſaued, & Citus ſhalbe ſaued, and 
                     〈…〉
                  we ſhall be ſaued, and ſo infinitely? Or ſhall we ſay that God in reſpect of perſons doth particularly aſſure ſome of their certaine ſaluation, leauing all the reſt to be toſſed and caried vp and downe with feare and hope, as a ſhip in the ſea caried hither and thither with contrary winds? Moreouer the very place Luke 10. 20. cited by the Cenſurer as a particular reuelation,

was not particular, but generall to all the diſciples, that beleeued by vertue of a more generall couenant made to all that beleeue whatſoeuer. For, to examine that place neerer, all the diſciples and all the Apoſtles, had not their names written in the booke of life: for Iudas was excepted. And here by the waye, the Cenſurers ouerſight Iohn 13. 18. Pſal. 108. 8. muſt bee noted, that draweth the place of Luke as ſpeciall and particular to the Apoſtles, being ſpoken of the ſeuentie diſciples. He wanted ſpecial knowledge herein, when hee ſo boldly made it an argument Luke 10. 17. of the Apoſtles ſpeciall reuelation.
               
               Of the moſt certayne and ſure foundations of our particular fayth and hope, the Apoſtle writeth in the eight to the Romanes, Rom. 8. 35. ſaying that nothing was able to take from him the loue which God beareth to him in Chriſt Ieſus, which hee ſetteth out by naming ſuch things as are moſt like and mightie to ſtrike a feare and doubt into his heart, as oppreſſion, anguiſh, perſecution, famine, nakedneſſe, and finally death it ſelfe: nay he addeth agayne, that neyther lyfe nor death, nor Angels, nor things preſent, nor thinges to come, nor height nor depth: that is, what ſo euer is in heauen aboue,

                  etogatiue of the Apoſtle, which is eaſely taken away by that S. Peter writeth to this purpoſe: that the Saints had obtayned lyke precious fayth with him: which was true not in the degree, but in the kind and ſubſtance of faith: which ſhoulde wholly differ, if the Apoſtles 2. Pet. 1. 1. had a faith of their particular ſaluation, and we not. Agayne the certaintie of fayth appeareth by theſe reaſons which the Apoſtle alleadgeth: Who ſhall

It is Chriſt that hath died, nay rather who is rayſed vp againe; who is alſo at the ryght hande of God; who maketh into ceſſion for vs. Theſe reaſons of a moſt ſure faith and hope that wauereth Iam. 1. 6. not, are of no particular reuelation, but of the generall doctrine of the Goſpel, and of the common ſaluation, as Iude calleth it, Iude. verſ. 3. which of right apper

               The Conſurers ſet onne reaſon is, that

the faithfull may fallaway from the fayth and from ſaluation: where as the things beleeued remaine moſt certayne. The groūd of this reaſon is to be denie
                     •
                  , for it is moſt vntrue, that any man who hath had fayth, can euer afterward finally fallaway. This may bee prooued by euident teſtimonies of the ſcripture, beſide thoſe alleadged aboue: as that which Chriſt teacheth of the beleeuer, in the eyght chapter of Iohn, He ſhall neuer ſee death: in the fourth, But the water Iohn 8. 51. Idem 4. 14. that I ſhall giue him, ſhall be in him a ſpring of waters, flowing vp to euerlaſting life: in the tenth. The father is greater Iohn 10. 29. then all, and none is able to take them out of the fathers hand: Againe of the faithfull it is true, which the Apoſtle vniteth, that God hath iuſtified and glorified them. So Rom. 8. certayne it is, as if it were already euery way perfourmed. But it were long to repeate any ino

                     〈◊〉
                   ſaye) may likewiſe caſt your ſelfe away, if you liſt: I can ſaye of Iudas hee neuer beleeued,

becauſe he was ye childe of diſtruction. Pſal. 108. 8. Iohn 17. 12. Act. 1. 18. For your ſelfe, if you haue bene alwaies of that minde you were of when you wrote this, you neuer had any true faith, and therfore coulde neuer yet fall awaye from it. What God may vouchſafe you hereafter I knowe not, but leaue it to his wiſedome to diſpoſe of his owne as it ſhal pleaſe him: but if euer he vouchſafe you this gift, I am ſure the gates of hell ſhall neuer preuaile againſt Mart. 16. 18. you.
               Your ſeconde poynt is of hope, which in your doctrine hath two reſpectes, one of Gods mercie, and in that regard it is full of confidence: the other in reſpect of Gods iuſtice, which hath feare and doubt annexed with it. The places alledged before of hope, you expaunde for the confidence thereof: which is true, if you ſtayed there, not adding other reſpects to roote out that which you woulde ſeeme to plant: for you ſhoulde haue made hopeſ
                     •
                   firme and ſure, that it can not be deceiued. But, as being of an other iudgement, you ſay that hope reſpecteth alſo the iuſtice of God, and the feareful effectes of his feueritie, which you quote out of the Scriptures: concernyng which effectes I will not diſpute with you.

Onely in alleadging the laſt, I note your wantes, that without all regarde or any warrant of the text, dare ſay, that thoſe reprobates Mat. 7. 22. 
                  ſhall come confidently in the laſt day hoping to be ſaued. For beſides that it is vnpoſſible that their conſcience can haue any ſparke of confidence or hope of ſaluation; there is not any mention of ſuch confident hope in the text, eyther expreſly or by implication. If they had ſome hope, then alſo they muſt haue ſome faith, for they goe together hande in hande. Although I thus linke them together, yet I do not confound Gen. 15. 6. Rom. 4. 3. Galat. 5. 5. Tit. 2. 13. them: but acknowledge this differēce, that as faith is a full perſuaſion of the promiſe: ſo hope is a patient expectation and looking for, of the things which are beleeued. It is you therfore, that in deede huddle and confounde hope and a vaine perſwaſion as one thing: where as hope is no leſſe ſure then fayth, being grounded vpon the ſame foundation of the worde, and hath the ſame fulnes of perſuaſion. But this is ignorance Heb. 6. 11. 12. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   and confuſion, which who ſo diſcrieth, may well marueyle. what cauſe you or your friendes finde to hoaſt of your learning or order for diſputation. Such cōfuſion muſt be in Babell, which leauing with you: I

ſaye further, that hope neuer reſpecteth Gods iuſtice, nor any thing elſe, but the things that are beleeued: which are y• moſt ſweete and pretious promiſes of his life, Luk. 12. 32. Heb. 6. 12. Item. 11. 
                        〈◊〉
                     . kingdome, and glorie. Therfore what cauſes ſhoulde hope haue to feare: True it is that neither fayth nor hope is ſo perfect in vs, but that in theſe reſpects you name, we often feare: but this feare is no woorke of hope, no more then doubt is a woorke of fayth. For to ſay that hope feareth in ſome reſpects, is as much as to ſay, faith in ſome reſpectes doubteth and is no faith. We doe both doubt and feare, ſuch are our infirmities: but that we doubt, it is not of fayth, but of vnbeliefe: neyther doe we feare, as you ſpeake of feare, by any effect of hope, but by the contrary worke of deſperation. But after ſo many and ſufficient reaſons Iam. 1. 6, 7, 8 Mar. 19. 23. 24. out of the worde to prooue this queſtion of importance, the woordes of the Cenſurer offer one not to be neglected. He affirmeth that hope in reſpect of the goodneſſe of God is full of confidence and aſſurance. Therefore although he will needes againſt reaſon make confidence fearefull, yet ſhall he neuer caſt any ſhadowe of feare vpon aſſurance, eſpecially vpon a full aſſurance
                  
ſuch as he confeſſeth. Nowe for the places 1. Pet. 1. 17. Phil. 2. 12. you alleadge, they concerne not this feare nowe in queſtion, but expreſſe a godly care to liue woorthie our calling, which is not againſt the confidence of hope, but a remedie agaynſt preſumption and ſecuritie. The place which you alleadge out of the preacher, ſheweth you to be a great clarke, Eccles. 9. 3. able to reade and cite a place, though you come not neere the matter by many degrees. The wiſe man there diſputeth of that a man may gather by proſperitie and aduerſitie, and not what he knoweth by the worde of God. For neyther can aduerſitie nor proſperitie ſhewe the loue or hatred of God toward vs: it was the deceitfull counſell of Iobs frendes, to drawe him into theſe argumentes of Gods purpoſe. But Iob by fayth coulde confeſſe agaynſt all calamities and extremities, ſaying, though he kill mee, yet will I beleeue in him ſtill. 
                  Iob. 13. 15. Thus the learned diuinitie of the Ieſuites, may appeare to them that will beholde it. Howe dyd you forgette the two milſtones you are wont to alledge for teachers in this matter. When a man you ſaye, doeth bebolde that he ſtandeth vpon, it maketh him holde: but looking vnto that ouer his head

he is in feare. Wo be vnto them that teach ſuch offenſiue and erroneous doctrines, deceitfully confirming them with ſimilitudes and diſtinctions ſo farre from the trueth, and yet eaſie to be imbraced, and deceiue the ignorant. It were better for them that a milſtone were hanged about their necke, & they throwne into the bottome of the ſea, then thus to infeeble the faith and hope of Gods children, by their faithles and fearefull doctrines. Yet the Cenſurer and his fellowes (if you will beleeue him) reconcile all Scriptures together, maynteyning confidence and feare in Chriſtian hope, whereas we are ſayde to confounde and huddle vp matters: but hereto I anſwere, let him that offendeth herein, be

                  yet we muſt beleeue, receyue and holde it. Here you Cenſure both the alleadging of the Ieſuites opinion, and the text auouched to diſproue the ſame. You ſaye it is falſe: that they graunt, the inuocation of Saintes is no where taught in the Scriptures.

Neuertheleſſe you graunt afterwarde that Monhemius charging them ſo, and therfore gathering that it ought not to be beleeued, they make this anſwere, y• many things are to be beleeued, which are not expreſſely ſet downe in the Scripture. To which purpoſe you your ſelfe adde afterwarde, that the inuocation of Saintes is deduced out of many and euident places of Scripture: whereby it appeareth, that you all confeſſe, that the Scriptures expreſſely teach it not. Nowe, that praying to Saintes is by neceſſary conſequence to be gathered out of many euident places of the Scriptures, and to be proued by generall Councils, Fathers, and the vniuerſall practiſe of all Chriſten dome from the beginning, though you boldly affirme it, yet you vouch not any one place of ſcripture, nor any one proofe of ſo many: If you haue ſo good bookes to ſhewe, it ſtandeth vpon your credit to bryng them to lyght. For where as your idolatrous praying to ſaints Rom. 10. 14. is deteſtable in euery ſort, both for the ſinne it ſelfe, and becauſe you commende it without any likely colour of excuſe: if you bee not able to anſwere to ſo grieuous a crime as you are charged with herein, (being in

deede high treaſon againſt the heauenly Maieſtie of the eternall God) yet you may alledge ſomewhat by waye of excuſe, to finde ſome fauour, if ſo great authoritie, as you pretende, haue carryed you awaye like ſimple people to ryſe vp and rebell agaynſt the Lorde. You ſende vs to your Catholike bookes touching this queſtion, which we haue ſeene and read, but fynde not any warrant, which may iuſtifie your doctrine.
               Hauing hoaſted of much & perfourmed nothing, in your ſecond Cenſure, of y• place alledged agaynſt Saintes inuocation, you blame me for auouching but that one text of ſcripture for the diſproofe: yet your ſelfe haue brought none for your neceſſary defence. To ouerthrowe the place, you bring two anſweres, but tel vs to which of them you will ſtand. The firſt is grounded in Limbo patrum, that is to ſay, hath no grounde at al, as there was neuer any ſuch Limbus, but framed & ſetled in your imagination. The ſeconde, which you ſeeme to relie more vpon, is in effect this aſſertion: not to knowe is not to allowe. This if I might graunt you, it doeth not take away the force of the place. Out

of y• which, allowing you your owne ſenſe, I reaſon thus: Becauſe GOD onely is here declared to be of fatherly loue toward vs, who alſo is readie to pardon vs, when Isa. 63. 16. Abraham by your ſenſe, would not knowe vs but condenme vs: therefore it is both wiſedome and duetie to praie to God, and the contrary both vanitie & ſinne. But becauſe you require other reaſons and places for this purpoſe, take theſe of a number. It is not lawfull to giue the worſhip of God to any other, according as it is writtē. Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God & 
                  Deut. 6. 13. & 10. Mat. 4. 10. Eſa. 42 8. Iohn 16. 24. 
                  him only ſhalt thou ſerue. I wil not giue my glory to any other, nor my praiſe to idols. But prayer is a ſpeciall honor and ſeruice that God requireth of vs, as it is ſaid in the fiftieth Pſalme. Call vpon me in the day 
                  Pſal. 50. 16. 
                  of trouble, and I wil deliuer thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me. Whatſoeuer you ſhall aske the father in my name, he will graunt 
                  Iohn 15. 15. 
                  it vnto you. Againe, a man cannot praye to any but to thoſe in whom he doth beleeue. Rom. 10. How ſhall they call vpon him in whom they haue not beleeued? But it is Rom. 10. 14. not lawfull to beleeue in any but in God alone: which is proued by the former places, faith being a principall part of Gods

ſeruice: Therefore it is not lawfull to pray to ſaintes or to any creature whatſoeuer. I might here ſhewe all promiſes made to prayer: all precepts and examples of prayer in all the whole bodie of the Scriptures to be onely of prayer to God: and no one precept, promiſe, or approued example of prayer to any ſaint liuing or dead, or to any other creature. But this place being cleare and mightie againſt you: I will conclude with the Prophet Ionas, They which obſerue lying vanities, let them forſake the 
                  Ionah. 2. 8. 
                  goodnes ſhewed vnto them: but with the voyce of thankeſgiuing will I ſacrifice vnto the Lorde, I will pay that which I haue vowed, all maner of ſaluation is of the Lorde.
               
               
                  In the eleuenth the Ieſuites are charged XI to teach that Chriſt neuer ſayd to the lay men, Doe this in remembrance of mee. 
                  Cenſ. Col. fol. 302. Seeing you pretend, that notwithſtanding you expound Do this, of the Miniſters only, yet you meane not ſo, but that the people are alſo commaunded to communicate at the Lordes Supper as well as they. I can the more eaſely leaue you to followe your owne ſenſe: for the doctrine againſt lay mens conſecration or miniſtration, is

not in controuerſie, but it is (except you faile) holden on both, that none but called Miniſters ſhould miniſter the ſacraments. But if, as you haue alreadie committed the greateſt ſacriledge and churchrobbery that may bee in taking away from the people the Cup of the newe Teſtament, and the Communion of the pretious bloud of our Luke 22. 20. 2. Cor. 10. 16. Sauiour Chriſt: ſo nowe by this expoſition, you would leaue the people at libertie, to chuſe whether they will be partakers of this bodie too, or no, y• you may driue them altogether from the table of the Lorde, the ſacriledge ſhalbe ſo made the more intollerable. If the Commaundement, Doe this

The firſt for adding, we muſt beleeue them, though they be manifeſtly againſt the Scripture, & for reporting the reſt ſo generally and confuſedly. Touching y• latter point, if my report of your doctrine be in theſe wordes: Traditions are of equall authoritie with the worde of God, meaning it of ſome only (for who would thinke it of all, you hauing ſo many and ſo feeble?) why doe you charge mee; as generally and confuſedly ſaying, al traditions are equal with y• ſcriptures?

                     〈…〉
                   you haue doubled to make it the ſounder. For aunſwere to the former poyut, I doe not onely auow that I haue faythfully reported my authors wordes (which is alwayes my iuſt defence againſt your vniuſt flaunder, laying them vpon me▪ but I ſay further, that their

practiſe compared with their wordes will 
                     •
                  uſtifie the report as truely layde downe againſt them. For proofe whereof not to goe further, the Cenſurer rehearſeth amongeſt theſe traditions, which the Popiſh Church charge our faith withall, the number of the bookes of Scripture, & the Lent faſt. Of al other traditions theſe two are taken out to ſtande for their owne credit and for the credit of the reſt: let vs therefore ſee what treaſons there are againſt God in theſe your traditions. Firſt the Apocrypha bookes are not in the auncient Canon or language of Canaan: the Eſd. lib. 3. cap. 3. ver. 1. & 5. ver. vlt. & lib. 4. cap. 1. ver. 2. Tob. 12. 15. Iudit. cap. 9. 2.

                  eeing among them ſelues. Yet your Trent conſpirarie doeth adde them to the number of the Canonical bookes, and bolde all men accurſed, that holde them not for canonicall ſcriptures. Therefore this your tradition is manifeſtly againſt the word of God. Further alſo, what is more manifeſt againſt the woorde of God then the doctrine of deuils? The Lent faſt, as you commaunde to keepe it, for conſcience ſake, forbidding meates created 1. Tim. 4. 1. of God to bee taken with thankeſgiuing,

is plainly called a doctrine of deuils. Furthermore your opinion is playnely deliuered to be with this diſtinction: Eccleſiaſticall traditions are of no greater authoritie then the writings and other decrees of the Church: and Apoſtles traditions are of no leſſe authoritie then if they had bene written by them, or then are the other thinges which they wrote: This is confuſedly taught and needeth yet more plaineneſſe: for not all orders deliuered by the Apoſtles, are to bee kept perpetually and vnchangeably, of like authoritie with the doctrine of the Goſpell, which they preached. The Apoſtolique doctrine is perpetuall, ſubiect to no varietie of perſons, of times or places: but ſome traditiōs, that is, ſome orders are altered, as that in the acts, where they commaunde to abſteine from ſtrangled and from blood: for it appeareth Act. 15. 29. that the Apoſtles commanded not this for a perpetuall order, alwayes inuiolably to be obſerued, but onely for a time to auoids offences: which cauſe ceaſing, the order or tradition was no longer in force. Againe, ſome orders might be ſet downe by them for comlineſſe, which yet were not to be beleeued as neceſſary partes of ſaluation, nor

yet to remayne for euer in that forme or kynde: and therefore can not be matched with the Apoſtolique doctrine of fayth, which is euer al one, and which whoſoeuer beleeueth not, cannot bee ſaued, Nowe 1. Pet. 4. 17. touching your pretenſed Apoſtolicall traditions, I vtterly denie that there are any ſuch, beſide thoſe which are euidently ſhewed, or by iuſt conſequence fitly gathered out of the written worde. For what ſo euer is neceſſary to ſaluation, is in this ſort to be Luke 16. 29. Eph. 
                        〈◊〉
                     . 20. 2. Tim. 3. 15. proued by the holy Scriptures. Therefore your Cenſureſhippe dyd well to adde, If they be certaynly deſcended from Chriſt and his Apoſtles. But how can this I pray you be certaynely knowen, but by the holy writings: can any other cuſtome or teſtimonie aſſure your conſciences what came vndoubtedly from Chriſt, or what from his Apoſtles: Is there any one of your traditions that you can vouch to deſcend from ſo ſufficient authors, otherwiſe then by report of inſufficient witneſſes: What is it then for you to boaſt of inuincible arguments to proue diuers doctrines not written, but left by woorde of mouth onely, whereas you bryng nothing but counterfeyt Couneils, erring Fathers, fabulous

ſtories, and Apocrypha ſcriptures. This is right the bragging Apoſtle, and a ſhewe of the vaine chalenger. Yf a man coulde be feared with the guilte of your armour, or with your plume of feathers, you woulde bee a worthie champion, wounding more with a vayne feare; then with the force of your ſhrinking arme. In this encounter of al your profes, you haue ſorted out two: the firſt is out of that excellent chapter to the Theſſalonians, conteining a prophecie 2. Theſ. 2. 15. and reuelation of Antichriſt. For an anſwere to which place it is firſt to be vnderſtoode, that the worde Tradition in the Apoſtles ſpeach, commeth as it doth in Latin, of a verbe to deliuer, ſo that whatſoeuer y• Apoſtle deliuered to the Churches, thoſe were the traditions hee lefte with them. Therefore I denie that Paule doth in any place by tradition ſignifie any vnwritten veritie, but that as in other places, he vnderſtandeth the doctrine of the Goſpel, which in the ſundrye partes thereof he deliuered. This appeareth apparauntly by the place ſo cited for your purpoſe, without regarde of any more then the worde Tradition. For in the verſes nexte before, the Apoſtle maketh mention of the Theſſalonians faith to

the trueth, ſaying, God hath called you 2. Theſ. 2. 13. 14. thereunto by our Goſpell, to obteyne the glory of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: and therupon inferreth this concluſion: now therefore brethren ſtand faſt, & holde the tradition which you haue learned, eyther by worde or by our epiſtle. Whereby it plainly appeareth, that the traditions or thinges deliuered by him, partly by word, and partly by writing, were the diuers partes of the Goſpell which hee had taught them. Wherefore the written woorde affordeth you no proofe for vnwritten verities. The ſeconde is of doctrines, which you ſay, wee holde not by record of writing, but by word of mouth from Chriſt and his Apoſtles: as for example, baptiſme of infants, celebratiō of Sunday, y• number of y• bookes of ſcripture, & the faſt of Lent. If this be not hudling and confounding of things together of vnlike ſort, I knowe not what may be called confuſion. For what order is it (to repeate vpō the Cenſurers occaſion y• which was noted in the fourth article) to match the baptiſme of children with the faſt of Lent: The one being by plaine argument gathered out of the worde, as namely out of the wordes of the conenant, I will bee

thy God and the God of thy ſeede, and Gen. 17. 7. thy children after thee for euer. This couenaunt dyd appertayne to both a like, to Abraham and his ſeede: whereunto the ſeale and practiſe was adioyned in circumciſing infantes of eyght dayes, as well as Abraham Ibidem. 17. 10. of great age, and that by expreſſe commaundement of God. Thus the doctrine is ſo prooued out of the written worde, as that no doubt remayneth. Nowe circumciſion was the ſacrament or ſeale of that Rom. 4. 11. righteouſneſſe which is by fayth, as Saint Paul teacheth: wherein it is equall our baptiſme. But this is your great learning; when you are not able for your ignorance, to prooue a doctrine out of the written worde, to ſay, we haue it by tradition, and by worde of mouth from the Apoſtles. Now your Lent faſt as you vſe it, hath not onely no grounde out of the worde, but is agaynſt the worde as I prooued before. If this bee your methode and diſcretion, I maruell not if good order be huddling and confounding in your accompt. For the number of the bookes, and for the Lordes day, I myght likewiſe make proofe out of the worde: ſo that if you can bring vs nothing by worde of mouth from the Apoſtles,

but your Lent faſt, your letters of credence will not ſerue you to be deleeued.
               The ſeconde Cenſure is that the place alleadged by me to confuce the aucthoritie of traditions, ſhould be impertinent. This the Cenſurer woulde ſhewe by three differences betweene it and this purpoſe. Firſt, of the diuers cauſe of thoſe traditions, which our Sauiour Chriſt inueyeth againſt, whereof they had beene authors to them ſelues, and of theſe which he affirmeth to deſcende from Chriſt and his Apoſtles. But as in deede the difference woulde be great if this were true, ſo being falſe and vntrue as it is, it can make no difference at all. Theirs were in deede ſuch as they affirme, and though you deny it, ſo are yours alſo. For which of all your traditions came eyther frō Chriſt or from his Apoſtles? whē you proue them frō either of them, your difference ſhall be allowed. Secondly, you ſay Chriſt reprehendeth not al obſeruation of mēs traditiōs, but the naughtie obſeruing of thē: which was, as you affirme, in that y• Phariſes eſteemed them more then Gods word, & brake it for the keeping of them, which you condemne. This alſo, if it were true, were a ſufficient difference: but it is

vntrue that our Sauiour Chriſt reproued onely the eſteeming of them more then Gods commaundementes. It can not bee denied, but he reprooued this in them in the ſame chapter before: but in the woordes alleadged, You worſhippe mee in vaine, 
                  Matt. 15. 9. Mat. 7. 7. 
                  teaching doctrines that are but traditions of men, (which are no wordes of compariſon) our Sauiour ſimplie rebuketh them for eſteeming the keeping of mens traditions to be any ſeruice of GOD: to which

                  od withall: the ſecond that ſome of them were impious, direct contrary to the word of God, ſuch as were certayne corrupt expoſitions of the lawe: where you are as like to them, as the ſonne may be to the father. For neuer were there more falſe gloſes vpon the word of God violently thruſt, and by litle and litle ſecretly conueyed into the Church, peruerting the true meaning of the Scriptures, and corrupting the ſimple worſhippe of GOD, then haue beene brought in by your Rabbines, that haue

obtayned the higheſt ſeates, and the moſt honourable names, more then euer did any among the Iewes. You ſpeake of the Talmud as dyd baſtarde Denis of the orders in heauen: but this floriſh of your ſkill in thoſe bookes becauſe it hurteth not the cauſe, let it ſerue you and your frendes, for as much credit as it may.

You take it as brought to proue, that we may worſhip the image of Chriſt with greater honour, then the bookes of the Goſpell: but you miſtake the matter, and wilfully (as it ſhoulde ſeeme) to haue ſome what againſt the cauſe, for how could you think, that he which deteſteth al idols, would alledge a place to prooue that the image of Chriſt is worthy honour more

Therefore you loſt your labour in framing arguments, to prooue why the material booke of Goſpels ſhould be no leſſe worſhipped then the image of Chriſt: for neither of bath are to bee worſhipped, nor any other creatures whatſoeuer, according to that which was before alledged to this purpoſe: Thou ſhalt worſhip

So in other queſtiōs it appeareth that either you are aſhamed of your owne doctrine, or els you will not defende it in ſuch ſort as you teach it, leaſt the vantage ſhould be euen in your own opinion, too open and too great againſt you. Alſo it commeth to bee noted howe you huddle the karuer of an image that is curſed, with a printer: and an image that is an abhomination, with the holy Bible: as if it were all one to make an image of God, and print the worde of God. Secondly (being herein cōtrarie to your ſelf,) you vndertake to proue that creatures may be worſhipped, and, as if the matter were

out of doubt, you demand what we will ſay to the worſhip done vnto the Arke, vnto the Cherubins, vnto the Serpent of braſſe. For ſome ſhewe of proofe you alledge the fiue & twentieth of Exodus, & the 45. Pſal, Exod. 25. 20. Pſal. 99. 5. miſtaken by you for the 99. In the place of Exodus there is no woorde leading vs to worſhippe, but onely a commandement of making the Arke, and the Cherubin of ſuch faſhion as is there preſcribed. If wee condemned all vſe of grauing or painting, this myght haue ſerued your turne: but ſpeaking only againſt your worſhipping of creatures, it maketh nothing againſt vs, or to iuſtifie your idolatrie. The place of Dauid doth not ſhewe what we muſt worſhip, but where we muſt worſhippe, euen at the footeſtoole of the Lorde with all humilitie, being there proſtrate vpon the ground, and humbled before him. The other two places of Numb. the 21. and Iohn 3. are brought Num. 21. 9. Iohn. 3. 14. by you to proue the worſhippe of the braſen ſerpent. In which places there is no ſuch matter, but a commandement as before, to make it & ſet it vpon a perch, that it might bee the better ſeene: with a promiſe that they which had beene ſlung with firie ſerpentes, if they looked vpon the braſen ſerpent,

ſhould receiue their health. Now, except to looke vpon a thing be to worſhip it, here is no place at all to prooue that you ſaye. If you had cited the place out of the kinges, there is a cleare teſtimonie, that the braſen Serpent was worſhipped: but it made not for your purpoſe, ſeeing good Ezechias in the ſame place did therefore breake it downe becauſe it was worſhipped. 2. Kin. 18. 4. Thus you may ſee what we haue to ſay out of the worde againſt your falſe ſuggeſtions, and againſt your miſtaking and miſconſtruing the Scriptures. But this place and that of Iohn were anſwered in the ſixt Article. The ſecond to the Philippians ſheweth a great iudgement and ſkill in you: it is there written thus of Chriſt: God hath exalted him, and giuen 
                  Phil. 2 9, 10. 
                  him a name which is aboue euery name, that at the name of Ieſus euery knee ſhould bow, of things in heauen, of things on the earth, and things vnder the earth. Hereupon you gather, firſt that the name of Ieſus is to be worſhipped, ſo as at the hearing of it, we ſhould bow our knees. Now, if this bowing be due to y• ſound of a name, which is but a creature, then in your iudgement ſome creature is to bee worſhipped:

and ſo conſequently ſuch as your Cenſureſhip ſhall appoint. But as when you ſpake of the Cherubines, you were not vnder the winges of y• Cherubines: nor being before y• Arke, receiued any Oracle: ſo now though you ſpeake of the Lorde Ieſus, exalted to the right hand of his Father, yet you are neuer a whit neerer drawen vnto him, nor vnderſtand what his glorie meaneth. The name of Ieſus is here no creature to feede the eare, as an image feedeth the eye (which Lind. de fug. idol. pag. 121 is your diſtinction borowed with the reſt our of Lindane) but it ſignifieth the ſoueraigne power and authoritie which Chriſt Mat. 28. 18. Iohn 17. 2. hath receiued ouer all creatures both in heauen and in earth, as appeareth in the ſame place, where it is ſaide that God hath giuen him a name aboue euery name: and Phil. 9. 10, 11. in the eleuenth where hee ſpeaketh of confeſſing Ieſus Chriſt to be the Lorde. The

                  owing of the knee, is not that which theſe words in their proper ſignification declare: for how ſhould it agree to Angels and other creatures, which haue no knee

                   as men haue: but obedience and ſubiection is figuratiuely noted by this outward ſigne of obedience vſed among men. The meaning therefore of the Apoſtle is to ſhewe

This being the meaning of the Apoſtle (that I may not returne home your wilfull and malitious termes) I leaue to ſhewe what good grace you had in alleadging this text for your purpoſe. But, the Lord reforme it, thus you are conſtrained ignorantly, or wilfully to ſtraine and conſtraine the holy Scriptures, when you haue once ſet down a reſolution to maintaine errour.

                     〈…〉
                  more then iii. leaues of the which ii. are ſpent in prouing a queſtion not denyed, and making much againſt your cauſe. For, prouing that religion ſtandeth with obedience to magiſtrates, which you tall temporall obedience, you muſt needes conclude that your Romiſh religion is no religion, becauſe it caſteth off this yoke of ſubiection layed vpon vs by the worde, and bringeth in a forraine ſupremacie to rule and ouerrule all by his Luke 20. 25. Rom. 13. 1. Tit. 3. 1. vſurped power and moſt vngodly practiſes. Therefore, taking in hande to confute it, you haue in deede confirmed my general concluſion: that Papiſts can not teach or mainteine the pretended Catholike religion, but they muſt be traytours to GOD and enemies to the State. But becauſe you bring euill argumentes to proue this good concluſion, I muſt examine them, and lay open that errour, which is ſecretly and ſophiſtically conueyed vnder a ſhew of probable and true propoſitions. Firſt, to proue

my concluſion againſt God, hee affirmeth Poperie to be the Catholique faith, which is to craue and beg the cauſe, and to affirme the chiefeſt matter in queſtion. Your argumentes laide downe at large, will make this your order of diſputation more playne, and the errour more ſenſible. Your former reaſon is this: whoſoeuer calleth him an enemie to God, that mainteyneth Poperie, vttereth the reproch of an vncleane mouth: All profeſſors of the Goſpell ſo holde and ſo call the maynteyners of Poperie, therefore all profeſſors of the Goſpel vtter the reproch of an vncleane mouth. In this reaſon the firſt propoſition is brought, againſt all art, to proue and ſhould it ſelfe be proued: it is placed firſt and ſhoulde be placed laſt for the concluſion: for if hee could in a true argument proue and conclude that which is onely affirmed in the firſt aſſertion, the controuerſie were at an ende. Therefore you ſpeake in a purpoſe to diſgrace the trueth, & not with arguments to proue your cauſe. Your ſecond argumēt is thus framed: Whoſoeuer ſpeaketh againſt thoſe y• would bring in a doctrine, contrary to the Goſpell eſtabliſhed, condemneth the former noble princes of England, y• Anſw▪
                  
ſpeaketh againſt them: therefore the Anſw. condemneth the former noble princes of England. I graunt the ſecond propoſition: but the firſt is ful of vntruth. For I ſpeake of the preſent eſtate and preſent practiſes among you: what is that to former ſtates and former proceedings? I ſpeake of ſubiectes, and the Cenſurer doeth drawe it to princes: I ſpeake of them that dealt contrarie to the ſetled lawes, and he doth bring it as ſpoken againſt thoſe, that made and mainteined their owne lawes then in force. This one propoſition being ſo falſe, ran make no argument, but ſophiſticall for a ſhewe of trueth, when there is nothing in it but falſhode. Alſo the Ieſuites woordes haue an argument intended for him in this forme: what religion former princes from the conuerſion of the lande vnto our age, haue mainteined, that muſt not be condemned: but they haue mainteined Poperie: therefore Poperie muſt not be condemned. The firſt propoſition is falſe, for wee muſt liue by the rule of Gods worde, and not by the example of men, that may deceiue and Pſal. 119. 105. Ex. 23. 2. E
                        •
                     e. 20. 18 be deceiued, as appeareth in the ſtorie of the kinges of Iſrael and Iuda. The ſecond propoſition is falſe like the firſt. For ſince

the cōqueſt, as I haue partly ſhewed in my anſwere, Edward the firſt, Edw. the third, Richard the ſecond, & others did ſet themſelues, euen ſo long ago againſt y• tyrannie of Antichriſt. And which is more, our Chronicles ſhewe that before Pſeudoauſtens comming, our religion was free from many ſuperſtitions, which he brought in: neyther did the Pope chalenge any preeminence of King Lucius, nor yet was it yeelded him long after. But while you pleade the authoritie, and, as you account it, the Catholike regiment of ſome of thoſe princes againſt me, you ſpeake againſt your ſelf ſecretly, opening your heart to diſcouer what you thinke of other Princes ſince, and namely of her Maieſties authoritie, and lawes eſtabliſhing the Goſpel. This is ſufficient to diſcouer the counterfeit honour, and heartie hate to the preſent ſoueraigntie. It followeth that I anſwere your obiections to the ſecond part of my concluſion: whether I make all Papiſtes traytours, becauſe they are of contrary religion to that which nowe ſtandeth in force by the grace of God, and vnder her Maieſties bleſſed gouernement. What may be ſayde of all Papiſtes generally, I leaue it as a

queſtion, which I haue not vndertaken: other men haue, if you will looke into their reaſons. But for all reconciled Papiſtes employed with Saunders in Irelande, or entred to withdrawe the people in Englande: ſuch as with Campion and his fellowes helpe forward ſome of the haynous attemptes that come to light from day to day, if I would holde my peace, themſelues will bewray and confeſſe treaſon agaynſt her Maieſtie and the eſtate: beſide open contempt agaynſt the Lorde, and the free preaching of the Goſpell. Neyther doeth my zeale ouerrunne my witte, in making mention of theſe matters, or my malice ouerlaſh all reaſon, as you haue tauntingly accuſed mee without cauſe. My zeale I wiſh increaſed according to knowledge, and againſt all your abominable ſuperſtitions: In malice I haue not dealt, but am carefull to deteſt all corruption in the ſeruice of God. Biſhop Tunſtall an authenticall witneſſe, ſhal acquite mee of this reproche, who for like Rome practiſes, vſeth more bitter and broade ſpeaches, euen againſt your great Cardinall, Cardinall Poole. For hauing charged the Pope with his peſtilent malice, (ſo hee ſpeaketh) and

Poole as his inſtrument, afterwarde hee A ſermon of Cuth. Biſhop of Dureſme printed. Anno 1539. calleth the Cardinall an arrant traytour, of a deuiliſh purpoſe to deſtroye his natiue countrey, alſo that hee ranne headlongs into hell, and was (for this Romiſh matter) incomparably woorſe then any Pagane. And will you call this hote doctrine: But to proceede, you note that religion ſtandeth with temporall obedience. It is truely ſayd of true religion: but Popiſh religion doeth take awaye from princes their ſupreme authoritie, making them the Popes vaſſalles and their people his tributaries. It warranteth all men to renounce and leaue their obedience, it diſpenſeth with all rebellion, and pardoneth any treaſon to thoſe that are reconciled for the day of execution. He that hath an eye to ſee, or an eare to heare, may heare and ſee this, and ſome fruites thereof, both in the land and without. Your trayterous bulles, your actuall rebellion in the north, where D. Morton had the firſt bull, & where your Prieſtes alſo ſayd maſſe in the tents: Stories trayterous ſhifte & chuſing him an other king, and pleading him ſelfe no ſubiect to the Queene, whoſe ſubiection and protection hee vnnaturally

renounced, without any cauſe in the worlde giuen, but abuſing her Maieſties clemencie: your ſeconde bull and ſeconde actuall rebellion vnder Saunders in Irelande: the alienating & mouing of the people by your opē Maſſes in Lākeſhire & elſwhere: your other attemptes which came ſo neere the quicke procured by your Ieſuiticall 
                  Saunders of the viſible monarch. in the 7. booke pag. 334. 732. 736. 
                  Maſſes of reconcilemēt: finally, Saunders booke allowing and extolling theſe rebellions and enterpriſes, canonizing the Captaines therof with the title of notable Martyrdome: what are they but open and actuall proofes, that there is in you a reſolution to doe any thing you dare do, for the ouerthrowe of the preſent eſtate: It is openly layde to your charge that your malice is ſo great to ſome aliue, that you will be auenged of them, as you were in Cambridge of M. Bucer and Paulus Fagius fiue yeeres after their death. Your example of the Apoſtles obedience to Magiſtrates of contrarie religion, proueth nothing for you, that holde not that doctrine, neyther yet followe their example. They and the faythfull in the primatiue Church, yeelded obedience to princes that beleeued not, and you doe it not to them that beleeue

and mayntaine the Goſpell, as it is proued agaynſt you. The like examples followe: for the bleſſed Martyrs of late times did al patiently yeeld them ſelues to death, according to the doctrine which they profeſſed, and witneſſed their obedience aſwell to the Prince as to GOD in their greeuous perſecutions. In all my booke there is no ſuch generall queſtion propounded as you charge me with, that euery one of a contrarie religion, muſt needes be an enemie to the State. I haue alreadie anſwered, that true religion teacheth and yeldeth obedience to magiſtrates: but your religion bringeth euen Emperours vnder the ſubiection of the Pope, to giue their attendance at his gate, and at his ſtirrup, wherein you withdraw from Ceſar that that is Ceſars, Matt. 22. 21. aſwell as otherwiſe you withholde from God that that is Gods.

Touching thoſe godly and learned men, Wickliffe, Luther and

Caluine, whome you charge with daungerous doctrine againſt Princes, I anſwere that the light is no clearer at No

                  ue, then that they taught all obedience to be due to Princes in the Lorde, and that for conſcience ſake without any rebellion: as in their writings it remaineth, witneſſed to all the world. Luther vpon the fifth Commandement, noteth for the ſacred authoritie of Magiſtrates, that this precept of obedience to them commeth next to the Commandement of obedience to God: adding that it teacheth vs how to behaue our ſelues toward 
                  Luth. in expoſ. decalogi Tom 7. pag. 1. 19. 
                  all Magiſtrates, who are ordeyned and appoynted of God. For Magiſtrates are comprehended vnder the name of Parentes, being the cōmon Fathers of the cō
                  mon wealth. M. Caluin beſide many other ſingular places of purpoſe handled, to ſet forth the ſoueraintie of Magiſtrates, hath theſe wordes in his inſtitutions: God hath not onely teſtified that he approueth and accepteth of Magiſtrates office: but 
                  Cal. inſt. lib. 4. cap. 20. ſect. 4. 
                  hath moreouer ſet out the dignitie thereof with moſt honorable titles of prayſe, marueilouſly commending the ſame. Wherupon he citeth that, that God calleth them Gods: concluding y• their authoritie

                  is moſt lawfull and holy, and in all the life of man, a thing of all other moſt honeſt. Moreouer, hauing taught ſubiectes their duetie to obey Statutes, to pay tribute, to beare publique charge and office: hee proueth Pſal. 82. 1. 6. Iohn 10. 25. againſt al rebels, that if they riſe againſt the Prince, they touch the annoynted of God. Thus the glorie of the Prince, is the good eſtate of the people: and the ioye of the people, is the bleſſed proſperitie of their Prince. I might ſhew the like doctrine out of Wickliffe, but it needeth not, after ſo ſufficient proofes againſt you for M. Luther, and M. Caluin. If on the other ſide they had wordes in the places barely quoted by you in the margent, to proue that which you charge them with, I doubt not but you would haue ſet them downe at large and in the beſt maner. But for the conſcience, this libertie it hath, that when a lawe is made againſt God, ſuch as your popiſh lawes be, then the rule of the Apoſtle taketh place, It is better to obey God 
                  Act. 4.

                  then man, which rule notwithſtanding alloweth no rebellion at all, but teacheth the ſubiect to offer himſelfe with all lowlines to the mercie of the magiſtrate, either to keepe a good conſcience, or to witneſſe

the integritie thereof to God, and his obedience 1. Pet. 4. 15. to the Prince by a patient ſuffering. But, if we may beleeue your wordes, you condēne y• doctrine that teacheth ſubiectes not to obey the Prince for conſcience ſake: wherein, if it be your opinion indeede, you giue a ſentence of condemnation againſt your ſelfe, and againſt all the recuſants in England or fled beyond ſeas.

but no difference at all in the word, no more then is betweene Omnipotent and Almightie. For (to paſſe by Phauorine, Heſychius Phauorine. Heſychius. Plutarch. and ſome places in Plutarch, who all make theſe two wordes of one ſignification) Plato maketh the matter moſt euident, Plato in dialog.

                  . It is manifeſt we will make anſwere that thoſe things are idoles, which are ſeene in water and in looking glaſſes, and thoſe moreouer that are painted or ſet out in types or portratures, & other things of this ſort whatſoeuer. By theſe words of Plato the Cenſurer may learne that any image carued, paynted, repreſented by a glaſſe or ſeene in water, is among the Grecians, where the worde is in his owne countrie and proper vſe, called an Idol. Tullie moreouer who could aſwell iudge of the Greeke worde, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   and of the Latine word image as the Cenſurer, be in his tranſlatiō maketh them one. Laſtly Cicero in Phaenon. Arati. to returne to the holy Scriptures, God in the ſecond Commandement, forbiddeth both the making and worſhipping of an

                  Image to repreſent the true God, or any of the falſe Gods. Thus much to ſhe we your vnlearned and moſt vntrue diſtinction betweene an Image and an Idol, which you and your fellowes repeate ſo often and vrge ſo much. You doe it to vpholde Idoles vnder a more honeſt title of Images (as you ſuppoſe) but as they differ not in name, ſo in nature they are all one, euen ſtumbling blockes of offence, the worſhippers whereof are open idolaters. I am taught by the word of GOD, that there were materiall and are ſtill ſpiritual Exod. 29. 38. Heb. 8. 3. 1. Pet. 2. 5. Heb. 13. 15. Heb. 9. 22. ſacrifices in the Church: but for ſinne I read y• there is no ſacrifice without bloud. So that your ſecond diſtinction of bloudie and vnbloudy ſacrifices is plainly againſt Abac. 2. 4. Rom. 3. 28. Gal. 2. 15. 6. 1. Ioh. 2. 1. 1. Tim. 2. 5. ſcripture: Iuſtice by faith wee acknowledge: but merite by workes is proued to be againſt the worde. So the mediation of Chriſt is according to faith, but your interceſſion of ſaintes againſt the ſcripture. For who is more mercifull then the Lorde that he may ſaue: or who more ready to heare vs, that he may be the Lordes remembrance
                     •
                  : faith that beleeueth the promiſe, and Rom. 4. 3. Heb. 4. 1. 1. Theſſ. 5. 8. Tit. 3. 7. hope that patiently wayteth for the iſſue of faith we acknowledge, and the diſtinction

I haue layde downe in the ninth article. Your counterfeit traditions of men and of the Apoſtles, are al without warrant in the cauſes neceſſary to ſaluation. But why haue you left out the diſtinction of the two worſhippings, Latria to God, and Dulia to images? Is it left out becauſe wee condenine it, and you now allowe no more of it: All theſe diſtinctions are moſt daungerous, when you will with ſome diſtinction or change of a name, reteine ſtill the ſame iniquitie, forging ſuch wicked deuiſes of man, to diſanull the truth of God. Therfore they are but your vntrue aſſertions and vaine bragges, that you diſtinguiſhe things into their proper natures, that you can proue eche part of your diſtinction conſonant to the word of God: that when you haue ſo diſtinguiſhed, wee haue no more to ſaie: that wee bewray our ignorance, and finally that the truth is made manifeſt to euery mans eyes. When any one of theſe fiue definitiue ſentences is proued true, I will acknowledge the reſt. I much maruaile that in ſuch vanting ſpeach, you would not ſet down one true aſſertion of ſo many. But you care not what you ſay to reproche the godly, making account

that your owne ſide will take it in good part, be it neuer ſo vntrue, neuer ſo reprochfull. The fourth argument touching the libertie of your pen, I haue anſwered already: but I anſwere further, you may haue it without print: and if that will not content you, there are printes inough neerer hande beyonde ſeas where you are, if we may beleeue you ſo often affirming it. The daunger & perſecution you ſpeake of, is a fruite of your murmuring ſpirits, complaining without a cauſe. For you go ſafely away wt many matters: & as much as you cōplayne againſt vs openly, as intercepting all your bookes & other Popiſh ſtuffe, I thinke you doe much more brag among your ſelues of many eſcapes. But if you had as many prints as you can ſet a worke, what can you of leſſer giftes write, that the moſt learned of your ſide haue not written long agoe, as Ecchius, Pighius, Hoſius: and which nowe Turrianus, Andradius, doenot furboiſh in a vaine hope, at laſt to make an ende of Sifyphus labour. What iſſue all theſe haue had of courſing & diſcourſing againe, the queſtious betweene you and vs, we may conſider it with great ioy of heart, & you in this kingdome and in our neighbour kingdomes

may behold it with vexatiō of ſpirit. Therefore notwithſtanding your bragges before you come to the triall, and that you tell vs, miſuſing the place, in the forehead of your booke of the fier in the moūtame, 
                  Deut. 5. 
                        〈◊〉
                     . yet we feare no more to encountre with you then they that ſee their enemies without armoure, or ouerthrowne before they come to giue them the charge.
               Laſtly you like not my opinion, that only the Scriptures ſhould bee admitted for iudges in diſputation. But the opinion is good, and the practiſe needefull, ſeeing the holy ſcripture is the onely touchſtone to make triall, and the onely iudge to giue ſentence in all queſtions apperteyning to the doctrine of fayth and ſaluation. Howe reuerently I thinke of the chiefe councils of the fathers and doctors, and what profit I acknowledge to come by their great labour, it was declared in my anſwere. But you euermore omit that which maketh not for your purpoſe, where in you take an euil but yet a readie waye to condemne a good cauſe. Notwithſtanding to determine controuerſies in iudgement of religion, I admit them no ſeate: but refuſe them al not onely with one breath, but with this one

ſhort ſentence: The rule is not ouerruled. You ſhoulde haue proued that the doctours and councils haue not places contrary one to another, and ſometimes contrary to themſelues: If you had cleered them of this warre among themſelues, you had made them ſomewhat fitter to make peace amongſt vs. In affirming that I ſay ſome of the fathers are condemned of forgerie, you doe manifeſtly peruert my playne wordes: for I ſpake of the places, and you drawe it to the perſons. It is one thing to ſay ſome places in Auſten are forged, and an other to ſay Auſten him ſelfe is forged. Now that places in Auſten are forged, and namely many of his ſhort ſermans to the brethren in the wildernes, it appeareth by Aug. ad frat. in Eremo. the iudgement of Eraſinus, and by the notes of baſtardie ſet downe in your owne editions. Cyprians places are alſo acknowledged by your ſelues, eſpecially that notorious booke of the reuelation of Iohn Baptiſtes head, where Cyprian maketh Cypr. de reuel. capitis Iohn Bap. mention of king Pipin that liued fiue hundred yeeres after that Cyprian was dead▪ But I neede not to alleadge any more, you wil not deny but there are many. Now there followeth a compariſon, that you

ground your beliefe onely vpon the word of God, and make it the onely obiect of fayth more thē we do. Your reports here, and in the ninth place confirmed 
                     〈◊〉
                   an othe, can haue no credit againſt your knowen doctrine and dealinges to the contrary. For doe you not in this verie queſtion, pleade the authoritie of men, as the warrant whereby we receyue the Scriptures? Doe you not denie that wee are ſaued by faith onely? Howe then doe you buylde your beleefe onely vpon the word of God? or make that the onely obiect of faith, more then we doe?
               In the wordes following you keepe on your courſe, prouing that which is graunted, and affirming that which ſhoulde bee proued. I dyd graunt that Councils, Fathers and ſtories yeeld profitable helpes to ſhewe the eſtate of the Church from time to time, and alſo for the better vnderſtanding of the worde of God: yet this is that which you make y• queſtiō as denyed by me, and to be proued by you. After this ſtrange order of diſputation, you myght as fitly in forme, and more truely in matter, proue your doctrine blaſphemous, and your practiſes

full of rebellion. If you woulde proue this, it were a true propoſition, but no confutation of that I ſay affirming the ſame. So in prouing that doctors bring great helpes to learning, you proue a trueth, but not in any ouerthrowe of my anſwere: For I haue acknowledged as much. The queſtiō in deede is, whether Councils and Fathers be iudges to giue ſentence in controuerſies, and rules to ouer rule interpretations: to the proofe whereof you ſhoulde haue tyed your ſelfe: but without any further proofe you affirme it, as a cleare matter and altogether out of dout. Is this that diſputation which you ſo boaſt of, to proue that is graunted, and to leaue that without proofe which is in queſtion? I ſhall not eſcape the note of audacitie, If vpon your Cenſures falſe report, I ſhal be thought to denie that which I doe moſt manifeſtly anouch. But this note of audacious bouldnes cleaueth to you, who bluſh not to ſay, that the authoritie of Scriptures dependeth vpon the teſtimonie and allowance of men: and that otherwiſe, we know not which is the word of God and which not. As many as hold this opinion had neuer their eares bored, nor their heartes opened by the

Spirite of GOD, to heare and ſee more then the bare letter, they neuer felt the lyfe and ſpirite thereof, which is the holy ſpirite of God, not onely bearing witneſſe with our ſpirite, that we are the ſounes of God, but alſo that the holy ſcriptures, are the worde of God, and his power to ſaluation: that they are alſo the rule which ſhould Rom. 8. 16. Eſai. 53. 1. Rom. 1. 16. rule all, and not be ouerruled of any. Neither haue thoſe diſciples of the word, humbled them ſelues at the footeſtoole of the Lorde, to behold his abſolute perfection in Rom. 11. 34. Iere. 17. 9. all his wayes, eſpecially in the full reuelation of his will to the ſonnes of men by his holy ſcriptures: neither haue they conſidered y• vanitie of vanities, & y• infinite hardneſſe of heart and corruption of iudgement which is in all fleſh. This humilitie would confirme them in the faith of that ſaying, no man knoweth the things of God, but 
                  1. Cor. 2. 11. Iohn. 16. 13. 
                  the ſpirit of God. This Spirit leadeth vs into all trueth, to knowe it and to proue it, and to be comforted thereby, not in the iudgemēt or after the ſenſe of man, but according to the worke of God opening our hearts, and ſanctifiyng our vnderſtanding, Act. 16. 14. ſo that the worke and iudgement is of the ſpirite according to the woorde of God.

Herein alſo ſtandeth an anſwere to your ſeconde aſſertion, that by the fathers wee knowe which is the right meaning of the word of God, for as the authoritie of the worde is confirmed by the ſpirit, ſo are the interpretations thereof alſo. As man is not the author, ſo he is not the interpreter of the worde of God, otherwiſe then by the autoritie of the worde it ſelfe. This ſaint Peter proueth, making it a reaſon why no Scripture is of a priuate interpretation, becauſe it came not from man: but the holy 2. Pet. 1. 20▪ 21. men of God ſpake as they were moued and caried with the holy Ghoſt: ſo that the holy Ghoſt doeth deliuer, and warrant, and interprete vnto vs the holy woord of God, expounding ſcripture by ſcriptures, and not leauing this high office to men, otherwiſe then to miniſters conteyning themſelues within the faithfull ſeruice of their charge in their written and authenticall commiſſion. And you dare not ſay (who dare ſay much) y• an interpretation is true, becauſe an ancient father hath it, but becauſe he hath it according to a trueth, and the trueth according to the word. Hierome is a notable father of ſingular giftes, but, to paſſe ouer other places, I verely thinke

you woulde cenſure him, for his interpretations Hieron. comment. in epiſt. ad Gal. vpon the eleuenth verſe, of the ſeconde chapter to the Galathians: and vpon the ſixt verſe of the thirde chapter, I write them not downe becauſe I am deſirous to couer ſuch blemiſhes, among other excellent gifts. Whether the viſible Catholike Church may erre or no, which muſt be conſidered in the particular members and doctrine thereof, I will for a triall admitte the example of your Church, but not the preſēt teſtimonie. Their example doeth teſtifie y• Apoſtaſie, which their teſtimonie will not acknowledge, though they ſhould do it to 2. Theſ. 2. 3. 
                        〈◊〉
                     . Tim. 4. 1. Apoc. cap. 13. & 14. &c. iuſtifie the prophecies that were deliuered of it before, and are nowe made ſo cleere as nothing may be more. To your manifold examples brought to proue that heretiques cleaue to the ſcripture: I anſwere firſt, y• heretiques alſo cleaue to traditions & ordinances receiued by word of mouth, Ireneus lib. 3. cap. 11. as appeareth by the complaint of Ireneus againſt them. Secondly the Scripture is the worde of God in his manifeſt ſenſe and conſtruction of trueth and life, and not according to the naked letter, whereunto, I graunt the heretiques did peeuiſhly ſticke, as you alſo doe, where it maketh for your

purpoſe. The philoſophicall proofes which ſome haue made, asyou ſay, for the wonderfull myſterie of Chriſtes two natures and willes, proue not ſo much for philoſophie, as you woulde inferre therby: for without philoſophie the ſcripture hath ſufficient proofes for that neceſſarie doctrine, as hath beene declared. But by the way, where is your iudgement in this aſſertion? debate the matter with your ſelfe, and you ſhall finde howe vnpoſſible it is for natural philoſophy to determin the ſupernaturall miſteries of the vnitie of God and man, & of two natures and willes in one perſon Ieſus Chriſte, which was a worke of God as great as the creation of the world. Notwithſtanding I haue acknowledged, that philoſophie being corrected and ſanctified by the woorde, may alſo be ſome helpe to heauenly wiſedome, but without it the woorde is ſufficient, to open all the counſell of God which apperteyneth vnto vs.
               Thus we take not away (as you charge vs) y• vſe of Couneils, Fathers, & other like helpes, becauſe of an abuſe y• may bee, but ſtand againſt them, y• vnder ſome vſe thereof woulde bring in and cōfirme the 
                     〈◊〉
                  . Therefore how doth the Cenſurer both accuſe

without conſcience, and giue ſentence without iudgement? who doth depriue you of theſe helpes? Who doth call you to the bare letter? How often am I enforced to repeate one thing to anſwere the ſame ſlaunder? As Councils and Doctors or Philoſophie may helpe, wee allowe them and vſe them: as Iudges we admit them not: and although we anſwere you to them when they are alleadged, yet knowe, that it is of that meaſure that is preſſed downe Luk, 6. 38. and floweth ouer, we are not bound vnto it with any condition. But what reaſons are theſe that followe in the Cenſure? Eche man may deny the Scripture to be Scripture, or wrangle at pleaſure vpon the ſenſe, therefore we muſt admit Councils, Doctors, and Philoſophie. This argument is very vnlearned and peremptori
                     •
                   againſt the maieſtie of Gods worde: A wicked man may wickedly take exceptions againſt it, therefore it is not ſufficient: he
                     •
                   may deny or wrangle vpon the ſenſe, therefore we muſt leaue the certaine touchſtone of God, and bee tryed by the vncertaine coniectures of men. If the Ieſuite had not abandoned all worldly commodities, as not caring for the good bleſſings of

God in this behalfe, I might eaſely confute this reaſon by one drawne from a leſſe aſſurance, and leſſe importance. An enemie may deny the Cenſurers euidences of land; or wrangle vpon the ſenſe of the wordes, therefore he muſt not ſtand vpon them, but ſeeke other teſtimonies to mainteine his title. But if theſe helpes or (as you meane) if the authoritie of men bee taken away, it is as much as to ſaye, controuerſies in religion ſhall neuer be ended. Wherein againe you make this weake and wicked argument: if controuerſies in religion be euer ended, it muſt not be by the Scriptures only, but by Councils, Doctors and Philoſophie. This is therefore the effect of your Cenſure and definitiue ſentence in this matter: that which God cannot doe by his worde, men may by their writings: that which God cānot determine by his trueth, men may ende and conclude by their lyes. And further to examine this your bould and daungerous concluſion, into what a ſea doe you drowe vs, calling vs to paſſe by the examination and iudgement of ſo many, ſo large; ſo doubtfull and ſo contrarie writers? If the worde be darke, are not the Fathers darker? If the Scriptures bee

doubtfull, are not mens writings infinitely more doubtfull? If any heretique or wicked man dare wreſt the holy ſcriptures of God, withe not much more dare to peruert, to denie, and to treade vnderfoote the writings of a mortall man? It came from the deepeſt bottom of the Sea, to drawe men from the certeintie & ſafetie of Gods word, to the daunger and vncerteinty of mens iudgement. Concerning the hereſies you mention, as Trinitaries in Tranſiluania, Anabaptiſtes in Poland, Adamites in Germanie, I pray God whereſoeuer theſe or any other hereſies bee taught, that they may be vtterly rooted out, together with all other weedes that growe vp of their owne accorde, whereſoeuer the Plowe is neglected.

                   me, for any thing I know in ſubſtance of Religion, alſo for Caluiniſtes in Fraūce, I anſwere, they are no heretiques, 
                     〈…〉
                   rie theſe names, but by your 
                     〈…〉
                   ſpeach, that, to bring the Goſpell of God into cōtempt, would make it to be thought the doctrine of thoſe men, whom the Lorde rayſed vp as notable inſtruments to publiſh it in their time, and as ſingular lights to chaſe away the miſt, which you had

brought in, in all places of your darke and ſinfull kingdome. How farre we differ from Lutherans in ſome poyntes, you are not the fitteſt man to whome I may make complaint. But howſoeuer you haue added your marke in the margent, Note this, yet the Scripture is no cauſe of this diſagreement. Vnder the name of Caluaniſtes you charge the Eſtate of this land with hereſie: for albeit we receiue not the name, neither build our faith vpon the doctrine of any mā, yet the Eſtate maynteyneth the doctrine which vnder that name you call hereſie. But you would onely ſeeme to lay that reproch vpon France. In England you ſaye there are Puritanes & the Familie of loue. What an high and deepe ſlaunder is this to all the godly in this kingdome from the prince to the meaneſt perſon profeſſing the religion: your Catholikes excepted, are all in England either to bee charged with the odious name of Puritanes, or with the moſt execrable abominations of the Familie of loue: What would not this your ſpirit attempt in the aboundance of your heart, if you durſt as well come to open action, as you dare caſt out theſe open and intollerable flaunders againſt all the godly

entred. We all holde the ſame doctrine of faith, publiſhed and mainteined according to the worde of God: we come to the ſame felloweſhip and communion in the exerciſes of religion, and ioyne all in the ſame defence of Gods holie Goſpell, yea we all, though not in the ſame meaſure, ſeeke the reformatiō of that, that at the Lordes time ſhalbe reformed to a further growth and beautie in the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt, which is the Church. Therefore notwithſtanding Eph. 1. 23. your ſlaunder, vpon examination it wil appeare, that thoſe in Englande, which are ſlaundered with the name of deteſtable Heretiques, are farre from the hereſie, & moſt readie to condemne it, or whatſoeuer is contrarie to the publique doctrine of faith, mainteined by the preſent Lawes of the lande, which doctrine is pure and holy, and agreeable to the moſt holy word of God, which the Lorde continue for his names ſake with peace vpon Iſrael. But to returne to the Cenſurer, hee addeth a manifeſt vntruth, ſaying that all the former hereſies ioyne againſt the Romiſh Church, in receiuing the ſcripture onely. To wade no further, the familie of loue, which you cite, are againſt you, who haue their ſeuerall

Goſpell of the kingdome, they build vpon Euang. regni. the curſed & thriſe curſed bookes of H.N. alſo they ſcorne the ſcripture learned, and in their loue to you, acknowledge ye miniſterie of y• word to come frō the Pope. Therefore they do neyther cleaue only to y• ſcriptures, nor liue in ſuch miſlike of your ſuperſtitions. Nowe for the matter, if your argument be good: Heretiques cleaue to the word onely, therefore it is naught: you may aſwell conclude, that we muſt not alleadge the Scriptures at all, becauſe they alleadge them: we muſt not diſpute at all becauſe they diſpute: which concluſions are all abſurd. For heretiques eate and drinke, they clothe them ſelues, all which are lawfull for all men to doe: therefore not whatſoeuer they doe, but whatſoeuer they doe as heretiques, that is a marke of hereſie. Furthermore to proue wantes in the worde of God, you demaunde howe it commeth to paſſe that the Scripture doeth not ende controuerſies among heretiques. I anſwere they are in the faulte, as you alſo like heretiques are by reſiſting the trueth: the worde is not to bee charged with any want. But let me moue the like queſtion, and haue your Cenſure touching

the doubt. You that haue the Scriptures, the Councils, the Fathers: you that haue Philoſophie moreouer, and ſtories, and which is moſt of all, the Popes breaſt and the fulneſſe of the ſpirite you bragge off: howe commeth it to paſſe that you haue not yet compounded your trouble ſome and long controuerſie, whether the virgin Marie was conceyued without originall ſinne or no: If the euidences you ſo ſtande vpon cannot in ſo long time ende ſo ſmall a matter, what will they be able to proue in the great queſtions of ſaluation: Agayne hedemaūdeth how ſuch hereſies can be, yf y• 
                  truth be ſo cleare. For triall of the truth & a manifeſt proofe what power there is in Gods worde, there muſt be hereſies and ſchiſmes: and God hath alwayes ſuffered 2. Pet. 2. 1. falſe prophets & teachers for a iuſt puniſhment of thoſe that loue not the trueth: neuertheleſſe the Scripture is cleare and plaine, where God giueth an eare to heare, and a heart to vnderſtand: if it be hidden, it is hidden to them that are loſt. But you 1. Cor. 4. 3. that once or twice beate at mee, as one whoſe zeale ranne before his witte, ſtaye your ſelfe. Doe you y• make no conſcience to diminiſh the authoritie of the worde of

God, crye out agaynſt vs, if wee refuſe the determination of men: will you that haue alreadie in diuers plates pleaded againſt y• ſufficiencie of Scriptures, now pleade for Philoſophie, Doctours and Councils, as able to end al controuerſies & ratifie your title: If we call you onely to the worde, not the bare woord, but adorned and richly attired with all fulnes of light and trueth, the cleereſt interpreter of it ſelfe, doe wee in calling you hither, depriue you of your euidences and witneſſes, ſeeking thereby to ſet you together by the 
                        •
                     ares for the title? I knowe no euidences but the worde, no witneſſes but the holy Prophets and Apoſtles: if your kingdome can not iuſtifie Iohn. 5. 39. it ſelfe by theſe euidences and witneſſes, let her bee condemned by them for euer. Your beadroule of fathers naming heretiques y• abuſed y• Scriptures, I tooke not the tale of them, they are brought in as vnneceſſary witneſſes of a matter alreadie anſwered, & not in queſtion. Laſtly you conclude, that we drawe in one line with the moſt curſed heretiques, and you make them our progenitors, becauſe we appeale to the worde of God, as the onely teacher and iudge in cauſes of religion. If this be a faulte, let it be

required at our hande: if it be your horrible ſlaunder againſt the worde and agaynſt the Saints of God, for giuing due honour thereunto, y• Lord require it at your handes in the defence of his owne glorie.
            
            
               Touching Chriſtian Franken.
               
                  TOuching Chriſtian Franken, which The fourth parte. is the laſt of your foure partes, it appeareth he hath vſed a true reporte agaynſt the Ieſuites, becauſe (as hee aſſured him ſelfe before hande) yet no man hath denyed the idolatries, the ſuperſtitious and heatheniſh exerciſes, wherewith he doth ſo plainly charge them. As for the firſt part of your anſwere hereunto, it ſtandeth altogether vpon falſe argumentes, as that, He departeth from the ſect of Ieſuites, therfore he is an apoſtata: He diſcouereth their wicked ſuperſtition, therefore he reuileth al catholike religion: Auſten confeſſeth that hee 
                  Aug. ep. 137. 
                  knew none worſe then they that fel in Monaſtical life, while he liued, therfore Frankē muſt be one of them. All theſe concluſions are barely affirmed without proofe: & therefore may be truely denied without any further anſwere. Notwithſtanding, it is to bee

noted, that againe you find no fitter taunt againſt M. Luther and Iohn Bale, then to call them Friers: and therefore you repeate the matter. True it is they were Friers, but forgiue them that fault, ſeeing they did caſt away their habit, and kept a better courſe. An other reproch followeth in charging vs plainely with coyning the newes of Rome, and with ſuſpition to haue coyned Frankens Dialogue: whereunto I anſwere if we haue not coyned, you haue, And as for Auſtēs place, it maketh for him againſt whome it is alleadged, and againſt them in whoſe defence you bring it. For if in Auſtens time with ſome good, this Monaſticall life brought forth others ſo euill that none were worſe, and hath declined euer ſince, it was time for Franken to come out from the middeſt of you. If ſo long ago, & in ſuch puritie of the Church, as was in Auſtens time, the Monaſteries did bring forth y• worſt men of all others, what did y• Cloyſters foſter afterwardes: Your other place of Auſten to proue it a great fault, to reproch many for one or two, I graunt to be true, but for your purpoſe falſely alleadged, becauſe it is not one or two of you, or ſo fewe as one or two hundred which are

accuſed of ſuperſtition & hypocriſie, but y• accuſation is againſt you all, for you apparell idolatrie with the name of deuotion, you nouriſh ambitiō vnder a Friers weed, and ſeeke an empire vnder a Prieſtes gaberdine, you exerciſe a Wolues rauening crueltie vnder Sheepes clothing, Treaſon is conſcience among you, and a iuſt execution is made a glorious martyrdome. Sander. de viſib. Monarch. lib. 7. Theſe are the diſeaſes that haue infected the hearte, and ſpread them ſelues as a leproſie, throughout all the bodie of your vnholy orders and irreligious men. So that we blame not many for a fewe, but cannot finde a few to hope wel of, in ſo great & diuers ſwarmes. This is not my complaint as you knowe, or of this time alone, but the complaint of many and long agoe. Therefore in drawing Saint Auſtens wordes to condemne mee as inſulting againſt Chriſt and his religion, for the fall of ſome one religious man, is to drawe him againſt his will, to condemne one for another, as was noted before.
               Your ſeconde exception to Frankens dialogue is taken, becauſe in your opinion, he applieth good thinges in the ſocietie to euill purpoſes, by which practiſe you haue

well noted that any good thing in religion or policie may be depraued. This practiſe you ſhoulde haue prooued in Franken, ſo y• exception had bene good: but you affirme it onely, as a man whoſe word muſt be taken for a proofe, & his opinion for an oracle. What Franken hath written you ſee, what he can write to a further accuſation of the Ieſuites life I knowe not: I thinke it was his minde to paſſe by perſonal matters, and to note onely the corruptions and ſuperſtitions of their orders and doctrine: for which cauſe alſo he was alleaged. Your bitter taunts againſt our miniſterie as looſe, are accuſations reaching to him that wil not be pacified for the ſin, with all your vnbloodie ſacrifices. The ignorant and vnfit miniſters we defende not, or any that may among ſo many be iuſtly accuſed of looſenes: but the godly preachers receiue the teſtimonie of learning and godly life, euen their enemies being made iudges. Whereas you finde a place in the dialogue to commende Ieſuites for great labour, diuine meditations, chaſtiſing of the fleſh and ſuch like, I anſwere there is an vſe and abuſe in ſome of theſe actions: you are charged with the

abuſe. The reſt, as your whippe and voluntarie abandoning of Gods bleſſings, both are ſuperſtitions, as was noted before in a fitter place. You remember who complayneth, that of all iniuſt men, they are moſt iniuſt, which when they doe moſt deceiue, Cic. off. lib. 1. and greateſt harme, they do it notwithſtanding that they may be eſteemed good men. Againe, wherin you haue a ſingular grace, you taunt vs as that we can not well bee charged with ſuch faultes as you count vertues in the Ieſuites. True it is we wiſh not to be charged with the righteouſnes of Mat. 5. 20. Scribes and Phariſees, but ſeeke a righteouſnes that may exceede it, ſuch as ſtandeth in the ſynceritie of a good conſcience 1. Tim. 1. 5. & 19. according to godlines.
               The thirde and laſt exception is againſt Frankens conuerſion, as not ſtrong to prooue any thing, ſeeing you can preſſe vs with many examples for one, which is your franke and bould aſſertion. But if you cannot truely alleadge a man for a citie, or a towne for a kingdome, this is a note who it is that in deede dare venture vpon any aſſertion, though all the worlde ſee the vanitie and vntrueth thereof. In place of manye, two examples are brought in with

their pretended reaſons. But firſt you giue ſentence before the triall, that Franken departed from vs vpon a fancie, and your fellowes vpon great reaſons and inuincible proofes. For Franken I anſwere, though I knowe he be not throwly cleanſed from the dregges of Poperie, but carieth ſome corruption that hath infected the hearte, (which you haue not at all blamed him for) yet his reaſons of departure were ſuch as enforced him therunto, being otherwiſe ſuperſtitiouſly addicted and deſirous to continue. Of your two men I can ſaie nothing, I knowe not what roote they had takē, that were ſo ſoone withered. But you that condemned me without cauſe, as blaming al your Catholiques for the fault of one, abuſing a ſentence out of Auſten againſt Aug. ep. 137. mee for that purpoſe, what is it that your ſelfe now bring in two runnagates to the ſlaunder of all, that conſtantly remaine in the trueth: muſt it bee no fault in you that was made ſo haynous in mee: There are belike ſome indulgēces from the pope, that what you do ſhalbe no fault, and what you ſay ſhalbe no lye.
               To come to your two rumiagates Xilander and Flaſchius, albeit you auowe

their proofes of running out, to be great and inuincible: yet they are in deede ſo inſufficient, that they haue plainely condemned thē ſelues by y• apologie, wherein they ſeeke to be iuſtified: & may ſoone finde better arguments why to returne, if their true repentance did opē a doore for their reentrie.
               1 For what reaſon is the firſt, that Xilander giueth? The Catholiques haue endured theſe fifteene hundred yeeres in concorde of one doctrine, and 16▪ ſectes haue ſprong of Luther within theſe ſixtie yeres, therefore he departeth to you: Firſt this reaſon ſtandeth vpon two falſe, and often confuted aſſumptions: For neither hath the Popiſh Church endured ſo long, nor ſo many ſects ſo lately growne vp of Luther. Secondly, though the aſſumptions were true, yet the argument doth not followe. For if antiquitie might prooue a Church, the Iewes would make a great clayme to the title: If ſects ſpringing vp, prooue no Church, what ſhal we ſay to the Churches of God at Corinth and in Galatia: Xilander did but ſalute our religion as paſſing by, that had no better reaſon of his falling away then this, ſo often and ſo many wayes confuced.
               
                  
                  His ſeconde reaſon that moued him to leaue our religion for Poperie, is ſucceſsion of Biſhops in the Popiſh Church, from Chriſt till now, which ſome Fathers make a great reaſon. Surely thoſe fathers knew ſome good by the biſhops that had bene before their time, but they could not iudge of the Apoſtacie of theſe that came after to occupie that Chaire. Againe thoſe fathers eſteemed not ſo much a Succeſſion of perſons, as the ſucceſſion of doctrine, which is farre from the biſhops of Rome, that teach many things againſt the word, and againſt the practiſe of the Primatiue and true Apoſtol

agree either in the number, nor in the ſucceſſion of theſe your Popes: Any one of all theſe, or of many other matters written by your ſelues, being well cōſidered, might haue bene a weightie cauſe to keepe him from that fall. For theſe biſhops, many of them ſucceeded with ſuch wicked conditions, and for ſo wicked purpoſes, that their ſucceſſion may ſhewe out matter to proue them rather the race of Antichriſt, and the ſpirit of fornications, which long agoe beganne to worke the myſterie of iniquitie: Hoſ. 4. 12. 2. Theſſ. 2. 4. but hath nowe made vp all the meaſures thereof, ſo that the propheſie is fulfilled, that Antichriſt in the ſucceſſion of his miniſters exalteth him ſelfe againſt all that is called God, or is worſhipped, and ſitteth in the Temple boaſting him ſelfe that he i

               3 As for his third reaſon of miracles in the Popiſhe Church, I leaue it as very falſe & inſufficient. Notwithſtanding ſome I graunt wil beleeue if a man come from Luke 16. 30.
                  
the dead which wil not beleeue Moſes and the Prophets. The kingdome and Church of Chriſt was planted in the power of doctrine and miracles, and alſo by the power of the holy Ghoſt, while Chriſt and his Apoſtles liued. Now it is againſt faith, if any looke for miracles to confirme the Goſpell againe, which is already ſo confirmed, that an Angel from heauen or any miracle worker Gal. 1. 8. perſwading otherwiſe, muſt bee accürſed. By miracles it is an eaſie thing to deceiue and bee deceiued, ſeeing Satan to that purpoſe changeth himſelfe into an Angell of light. Such were many of the lying miracles not onely printed from Rome, but receiued and regiſtred at Rome, and thruſt vpon mens conſciences to beleeue, being matters that might eaſely drawe them headlonges into all error and idolatrie, as was propheſied of this kingdome of Apoc. 13. 1

And what are all the reſt without this holineſſe: Againe of thoſe three notes that moued his falling off, two are all one in worde and ſenſe. For the worde vniuerſal, and the word Catholique, are as theſe two wordes, Wodeman and Xilander, which do not ſignifie two, but one and the ſame thing. That the Church of God muſt alwaies haue a viſible and glorious Maieſtie vpon the earth, is not yet proued. Alſo that the Church of Rome was neuer Catholique or vniuerſall, as it pretendeth, the Churches of y• Eaſt, while they floriſhed, & the Greeke Churches, ſuch as remayne at this day, doe make ſufficient proofe.

Moreouer (as I declared) it neuer triumphed ouer heretikes, it hath not any peculiar cuſtodie of the Scriptures, neyther dorth the authoritie of the Goſpel depende vpon hir ratification, being authenticall of it ſelfe. Therefore al theſe reaſons and put them together, coulde not open the leaſt dore for his departure, if he had euer beene placed within the Church.
               5 The fift reaſon is that the Romiſh Church is the true Church, becauſe many that liued there, are nowe Saintes in heauen, and namely Dominic and Frauncis, as Xilander doeth imagine. I ſay as before, there was a time when Ephraim ſpake, & Hoſ. 13.

                  ioned Frauncis the Fryer among his ſaints, it myght haue beene hoped the Ieſuites would refourme that booke, or rather condemne it to the pit of hell. But to returne to Xilanders argument, it is a very bad one, prouing the leſſer doubt by the greater. For it is not ſo great a doubt, what thoſe famous Fryers taught, as whether they be in heauen. Neuertheleſſe if it were out of doubt they are in heauen, yet the argument doeth not neceſſarily followe. For many are in heauen that haue liued in errour, becauſe the rich mercie of God doth aſwell pardon errour to him that repenteth, as other iniquities. No man will take this for a good argument: one 
                     •
                  f the two that were crucified with Chriſt is nowe in heauen, therfore he was no thiefe, therefore he liued not in error: yet ſuch altogether is the fifth motiue that moued Xilander to go to Rome in hope perhappes to be a Saint.
               6 To the ſixt reaſon which maketh the Papiſtes reuerent in their wordes, and the

other ſyde rayling, blaſphemous and diſhoneſt in their ſpeaches and writinges, I anſwere with Salomons woordes: he that iuſtifieth the wicked, and he that coudemueth Prou. 17. 15. the innocent, are both an abhomination before the Lorde. This reaſon is repeated in the next, and is there further anſwered.
               7 The ſeuenth reaſon hath nothing in prayſe of the Papiſtes as the former had: but is altogether a repetition of that which was ſaid againſt the godly, as railing and miſreporting their aduerſaries. Wherein for proofe againſt this ſlaunder, I appeale to the places of the Cenſure alleaged againſt Martin Luther, and charging him with moſt foule opinions, ſuch as after his conuerſion he neuer mainteined in worde or deede, which his practiſe prooued while he yet liued: and his writings doe teſtifie now after his death. Doctor Watſon alſo may make a triall of this matter againſt you, who in a ſermon before Queene Marie, D. Watſon in the former of the 2. ſermons printed anno. 1554. charged no ſmall men as he ſaith, but our great biſhops, to ſay that euery man and woman, might at the Lordes table, take bread and bleſſe it (which he calleth tonſecration) and ſpeake the woordes of the inſtitution, aſwell as the miniſter. Notwithſtanding

here I am to aduertiſe the reader, that Papiſtes miſreport thē ſelues now ſaying and at an other time denying the ſame, as appeared in many of the XIII. articles by y• Cenſurers own practiſe. For when the Ieſuites are truely charged, he will not graunt that which is truely auouched againſt them, but changing the queſtion will ſeeme to ſay leſſe then they teach. For one example they are charged to commit idolatrie in worſhipping images: the Cenſurer will ſeeme to denie this, ſaying, they giue no worſhip to the image but to God: this diſtinction is not good: and further more the aſſertion is falſe. For it hath been prooued that they giue worſhip to the very image of Chriſt: and, which is more, that they giue y• greateſt worſhip of Chriſt him ſelfe to his picture. Therefore al men are to conſider this both for our defence, & to auoyde the errour that may come by their deceites. For in the fielde, where they ſtand in feare of the aduerſarie, and in their perſwaſions, when they would win a proſelyte, the pretended Catholiques will not lie open, but cloke a great part of their ſhamefull doctrine: which is their ſubtiltie to drawe away diſciples, and to leaue leſſe aduantage to their enemies. Therefore to

a man not acquainted with their double dealing wee may ſeeme to report them otherwiſe, then they holde in diſputation, when notwithſtanding we report them no other wiſe then they openly teache in their kingdome, and publiſhe in their writings. Wherefore I may conclude that this reaſon was groūded vpon a manifeſt vntruth: Xilander iudged of Iudas by the kiſſe, not Luke. 22. 48. by the treaſon.
               8 Laſtly for a reaſon we are falſely charged to eſteeme all our aunceſters damned: to breake their willes, and conuert to prophane vſes, that which they gaue to mainteine idle Monkes and Friers, and to redeeme them by maſſes out of purgatory. Whatſoeuer he thought in him ſelfe, or imagined in others, wee thinke not our anceſters damned: but leaue iudgement to Iam. 4. 12. the Lorde, to whom the iudgement of life and death doth belong: not ſearching out his ſecret coūſels which are vnſearchable. As for the ornamēts which they beſtowed, not vpon the ſeruice of God, to the inſtruction of their ſoules, by the preaching and miniſterie of the Goſpell, but vpon the great harlot and to the inlargement of her kingdome, they are brought home agayne to better vſes: and I thinke many of your

beſt friendes will holde and enioy them as better beſtowed.
               Your ſeconde man, commeth ready Sebaſtian Flaſchius. furniſhed to your hande out of the former booke of Lindan. But becauſe you promiſe not to deliuer the ſame reaſons that were touched before, let vs ſee how faithfully you keepe art and promiſe. Flaſchius firſt reaſon is the ſame that Xilanders ſeuenth: where they ſay we report the papiſts to teach that they teach not. Alſo his thirde is but a particular of that which the other man did generally auouch in y• ſixt againſt ye godly as vſing diſhoneſt ſpeach.
               
               To ſpeake of them particularly, Flaſchius his firſt reaſon is, that your Catholiques teach cleane contrary to that which we report of them. We report them to teach, that the Pope is ſupreame head of the Church, doe they teach the cleane contrary? we charge them to aſcribe ſome merit to workes, do they teach cleane contrary? Againe we charge them that they auowe tranſubſtantiation, do they teach no ſuch thing: Wee moreouer chalenge them for giuing worſhippe to images, do they teach the contrary doctrine? wee accuſe them for denying the ſufficiencie of ſcriptures, do they make them ſufficient? 
                     〈1 page missing〉
                  
                  
I might bring infinite ſuch examples, but theſe may be ſufficiēt to ſhew how Flaſchius ſtūbled at his firſt going out at the gace.
               2 The ſecond reaſon is drawen from Luthers mind in writing againſt yt Romiſh Church, of en

                  y, as the rūnagate doth ſuppoſe. How is this prooued out of any place quoted for a ſhewe of proofe: Agayne, if it were proued that enuie made M. Luther write againſt Popery, how doth the runnagates reaſon followe: The preacher preacheth of enuie, therfore his doctrine is to be forſaken: The Phiſition vſeth his arte for couetouſnes, therfore his coūſel is to be deſpiſed. If Flaſchius had learned what the place of S. Paul ment where he ſaith, he was glad & reioyced that Chriſt was preached, eyther vpon enuie or contention, eyther

                  ity. But you haue added the Apocrypha bookes, although they neither agree in ſome pointes with y• ſcripture, nor yet one with another as hath bene declared. Touching Fathers and Councils, it is too foule an accuſation to charge vs, y• wee eſteeme no more of them thē of y•

                  s appeareth to be ſome corrupt hypocrite, who meaſured other men, by y• vanity & wickednes of his own heart. So farre doe wee honour the councils as they can well aſke, or doe deſerue honour. For (that I may bee ſuffered to repeate with the Cenſurer) we receiue from them ioyfully and with reuerence whatſoeuer they deliuer vnto vs with ſufficient warrant out of the worde of God: acknowledging them not only to haue brought great

profit to the church in their time, but alſo to their poſteritie. This honour we giue not to the deuiliſh Alcaron: what the Apoſtata did or will do, I can not report.
               5 The fifth reaſon is a ſlaūder againſt y• truth, blaſphemouſly caſt out againſt it and the profeſſers thereof. It is that our newe opinions (as Flaſchius & our enemies wil needes call them) are olde hereſies, condē
                  ned by name in the primitiue Church. Whereunto I anſwere, that if Saunders moſt traiterous booke quoted for proofe in the margent, or Lindane with his roule of hereſies, or the runnagate by any good trial can proue, that either we pull olde hereſies out of the graue, or breed newe that ſhould be buried, though it be no good reaſon why Sebaſtian ſhould flie to them, yet wee will graūt it a full ſufficiēt reaſō, why he ſhould take the wings of the morning & flie from vs. But if this runnagate in the malice and error of his heart, hath ſpoken good of euil, Eſa. 5. 20. and euill of good; if he haue forſaken darknes for light, and light for darknes, then he hath eſcaped a bleſſing, and made haſte to finde a curſe.
               6. 7. The next two reaſons are of y• ſame forge with all the reſt, they prooue nothing but the malice and blindnes of your conuert.

                  as was declared before againſt y• Cenſurers like ſlaūderous reports. Out of his large volumes of talke at tables, wee know not ſo much what Luther ſaid, or vpon what cauſes, as what thoſe men remē
                  bred or added, which did collect the bookes.
               8 The laſt reaſon of Flaſchius, was cunningly choſen out to make a fit concluſion of your taūting and ſlaunderous Cenſure, hauing nothing but the venim of the aſpe, that laie vnder the runnagates tongue. It ſtandeth vpon many points ſhuffeled together: as that we are partiall, that we exaggerate euery litle fault in our aduerſaries, and liue our ſelues moſt vitiouſly in fornication, and chaunge of wiues, according to Luthers doctrine: the proofe whereof is alledged in one preacher vpon the runnagates credit, with other thinges that this ſhameleſſe man is aſhamed to vtter. What an heape of reproches is this without any proofe? Againſt this I haue proued that M. Luther taught no libertie offornicatiō, but the contrarie, as appeareth at large by

many his learned and godly treatiſes, Alſ

If Flaſchius euer met with a mate like him ſelfe, that would haue made a match wt him in chaunging of wiues, he was to blame, except the moſt fault was in himſelfe, that he did not bring it before the Magiſtrate: vpon complaint and proofes it woulde haue appeared, that y• religion ſuffereth no ſuch wickedneſſe to goe unpuniſhed. This may be a particular ſlaunder like the reſt, but if it were true in Flaſchius and one of his companions, both fitte to haue bene thruſt out of the Church before eyther departed, what is this to all:
               
                  Theſe are your two falſe witneſſes, wel able to diſcredit euen a true matter comming from their report, as they themſelues are diſcredited by the teſtimonies they haue giuen in agaynſt the Goſpell, being reportes ſo full of manifeſt reproch and vntrueth. It is verie like they omitted the true reaſon of their departure. Perhappes they went out becauſe they woulde not or coulde not any longer abide within, as it fell out with Demas 2. Tim. 4. 12.

He in your faces rendered good reaſons of his conuerſion from among them, where wickedneſſe of life, and abhomination of doctrine ſtriue, which may cal downe the greateſt vengeaunce. But this needeth not my repetition, and I labour not to preſſe you with examples or corruptions of men: it is beſide the queſtion we haue in hande. My prayer and labour is for the defence of his trueth, from the which we receiue life, and 1. Cor. 9. 16. are to ſtriue for it vnto death. The Lord requireth this ſeruice at our hands, & he will at his good time bleſſe it with manifolde bleſſings, the fruit whereof it may be ſome of vs ſhal not ſee, but our poſteritie ſhal behold it, notwithſtanding all the wiſedome Pro. 21. 30. and power and counſell of man to the contrary. For the Lord hath reuealed the man of ſin by the preaching of the worde, & hath ſhaken his chaire with a mightie arme, hee wil not withdraw his hand, til he hath vtterly cōſumed Antichriſt with the ſpirit of his 2.
