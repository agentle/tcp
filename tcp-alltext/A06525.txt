Which Sermon is an exposition of the Gospell appointed to be red in the Church on the second Sonday in Aduent, and is now newly translated out of Latin into English, and something augmented and enlarged by the translator, with certaine notes in the margent.
            
            
               
                  Act. 17. 30.
¶ Now God admonisheth all men euery where to repent, because he hath appointed a day in the which he will iudge the world in righteousnes, by that man whom he hath appointed: whereof he hath geuen an assurance to all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.
         
         
            
            
            2. Pet. 3. 3.
            THis first vnderstand, that there shall come in the last daies, mockers, which will walke after their lustes, and say: where is the promisse of his commyng? for since the fathers dyed, all thynges continue a like from the begynning of the creation. For this they willingly know not, that the heauens were of olde, and the earth that was of the water and by the water, through the word of God. Wherfore the world that then was, perished, ouerflowed with the water: But the heauens and earth, which are now, are kept by the same word in store, and reserued vnto fire agaynst the day of iudgement, and of the destructiō of vngodly men. Dearely beloued, be not ignorant of this one thyng, that one day is with the Lord, as a thousand yeares, and a thousand yeare, as one day. The Lord is not slacke concernyng hys promes (as some men count slackenes) but is pacient toward vs, & would haue no man to perish, but would all men to come to repētaunce. But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in the which the heauens shall passe away with a noyse, and the elementes shal melt with heate, and the earth with the workes that are therein, shalbe burnt vp. Seyng therfore that all these thynges must be dissolued, what maner persons ought ye to be in holy conuersation and godlynes: Lookyng for, and hastyng vnto the commyng of the day of God, by the which the heauens beyng on fire, shalbe dissolued, and the elementes shall meltEsay. 65. 17. and. 66. 22. with heate? But we looke for new heauens, and a new earth, accordyng to hys promes, wherein dwelleth righteousnes. Wherefore, beloued, seyng that ye looke for such thynges, be diligent that ye may be founde of him in peace, without spot, and blameles.
         
         
            
            ¶ To all the inhabitauntes of England, and other els where that vnderstand the English toung, the translator whisheth true knowledge of God, contained in his word, which is lyfe euerlastyng.
            
               BEfore tyme, not many yeares since (dearely beloued brethren & countreymen) the Disciples of Antichrist, and Apostles of Sathan, for the establishyng of their Lordes kyngdome (knowyng that the cōtinuance therof, was the increase of their owne estimatiō, wealth and pleasure in this world) haue deuised many politicke practises, so wicked and so deuilish, that whosoeuer beholdeth them well, shall soone perceaue they were not inuented without the counsayle of their Lord and master. Wherof this was the first and chief, and (as I may say) the ground of the residue to keepe all men, both Princes and their subiectes, in ignoraunce of God, & hys word, that they not knowyng the truth, might the more casely be brought into all kynd of deuilish heresies: that they not vnderstanding vice, should not be able to reprehēd the horrible wickednes of Antichrist and hys ministers. To this end they haue restrayned all the laity throughout Christendome, from readyng the Scriptures, and haue forbydden them to be Printed in their vulgare tounges, an din stede thereof, haue geuen them to occupie theyr braynes withall, fables



of Robin Hood, of Gie of Warrike, of Geuis of Hampton, of the Knightes of the round table, of the iiij. sonnes of Amō, filthy tales, Chaucer, the Court of Uenus, most horrible & blasphemous lyes out of Saintes Legendes, and such lyke. Wherby men beyng drowned in ignoraūce, and detestable heresies, haue bene cast downe headlong into the most miserable pit of hell. But now it hath pleased almighty God, towardes the commyng of our Sauiour to Iudgement, by the preachyng of hys word, through the workyng of hys holy spirite, to oppresse the power of Sathan, to cut the hornes of Antichrist, to reueale2. Thes. 2. 3 the man of sinne: Which sittyng in the Temple of God, boasteth hym selfe as God. Now it hath pleased our Sauiour Christ to diminish the kyngdome of Antichrist, & to aduaunce his owne kyngdome, to deface y• Disciples of Antichrist, and to glorifie hys owne Disciples. He hath driuen out the filthy swyne and wylde bores, that haue spoyled hys vineyarde, andMat. 20. 1. hath hyred laborers to husband it agayne, that it may yeld hym frute now at haruest tyme, whē he commeth to receiue the same into hys euerlastyng kyngdome: at which tyme hys faythfull seruaūtes shall receiue for their hyre, a peece of money that neuer shall fayle, and shall eate and drinke the frutes of their labours with hym, world without end. Therfore it is conuenient



and necessary for all Gods labourers, that is to say, Princes and their Magistrates, Prelates, and all Ecclesiastical Ministers, to labour diligētly in the Lords vineyard, to kepe out these swyne, which Antichrist hath sent to deuoure it: not onely to yoke them, but also to set dogges on thē, which wil both barcke and plucke of their

               ares, if they enterprise to breake through the hedge, and to route vp y• vines with theyr deuilishe bookes, altogether voyde of Gods word and of reason, to euery man that hath any vnderstandyng, and knowledge of God. To this end by the authority of our soueraigne Lady the Queenes Maiestie in our Realme, and other Princes in other Realmes, a great number of godly men haue preached diligently, other haue written very profitable bookes of Diuinitie, both in Latin, and in theyr own vulgare toung, and diuers haue translated good bookes out of straunge tounges into their owne language, husbanding therby the Lordes vineyard, and keepyng out the swyne that endeuer to destroy it. Amongest whom I beyng one more ready to shew my good will, then able to do any great seruice, haue chosen this short Sermon of Martin Luther, the faythfull seruant of God, Grādcapitaine vnder our Sauiour Christ, and chief hunter of these wyld bores, vnto theyr father the deuill, from whēce they were sent to destroy the sincere



& true worshyp of God. This mans Sermon (I say) concernyng the commyng of our Sauiour to Iudgemēt, and the signes that go before the last day I haue chosen to translate into our English toung, as that which I thought a most cōuenient labour in this last houre of the day, to preserue inMat. 20. 6. the Lordes vineyard the ripe grapes from rottyng and from wild beastes, and to hast those that are vnrype agaynst the Lordes commyng, that is to say: to comfort the faythful, to confirme the weake, and to instruct the ignoraunt, in diuers necessary pointes of doctrine, or at the least to geue them a watchword of our Lordes commyng, that they may now at the lengthMath. 24. 49. Mat. 25. 4 cease from sinityng theyr felow seruants, and from eatyng and drynkyng with the drunken, and may make them selues ready with oyle in their lampes to receiue hym: that when the trumpet bloweth, and the bridgrome commeth, we may all folow hym into hys euerlastyng tabernacle, therein to lyue with God the father, the sonne and the holy ghost, in euerlastyng ioy. To whom be all prayse, honor, and glory world without ende.

The Sea and the water shall rore, and mēs harts shall fayle them for feare, and for lookyng after those thynges which shall come on the earth. For the powers of heauen shall moue, and then shall they see the sonne of man come in a cloude with power, and great glory. When these thynges begyn to come to passe, then looke vp, and lift vp your heades, for your redemption draweth nere. And he shewed them a similitude saying: behold the figge tree, and al other trees. When they shoote forth theyr buds, ye see and know of your selues that sommer is then nigh at hand. So lykewyse ye also, When you see these thinges come to passe▪ be sure that the kyngdome of God is nigh.

            The Sermon, or exposition of the Gospell.
            
               IN this dayes Gospel,The effect of the Gospel▪ and the cause why it was written. Christ our Lord shew eth vs what shalbe the estate, and conditiō of the world, whē all things draw to an end: Wherby we may know when the great and horrible day shall appeare (in the which Christ our Lord hym selfe shall come openly to Iudgement) that no mā nede to wauer, or doubt of ye matter. For he sheweth playnly the signes that shal be sene in the last age, and shal go before the last day, as tokens therof: because it cānot be chosen, but yt soSignes be fore y• last day proued by humane reasō, groū ded vpon a certayne truth. straūge, yea & that the last chaūge of the whole world should be declared by many and great tokēs, seyng that much lesse alterations of countreys and natiōs haue ben signified by signes and wonders goyng before. Bycause this prefēt



Gospell hath ben before tyme sufficiently declared, so that now it is well knowen vnto all men: I mynde not to shew the doctrine that therof may be gathered, but after an other maner and fashion to handle it, to the glory of God & our consolation. For therfore is it put in writtyng, and made manifest by preachyng, that it may serue to our cōfort, and to the encrease of fayth and hope in vs,Rom. 15. 4 which professe Christ, and beleue in hym: notwithstandyng there is good cause why it may be a terror vnto the other sort of mē, I meane the wicked vnbeleuers, whose destruction these signes do portend: Who in dede are nothyng moued with them at all, but with security of mynde do contemne them.
            Therfore (commendyng them to our God, & theyr Iudge which shall come and reward them, accordyng to theyr desertes, that by



experiēce they may alwayes feele yt, which now they neither beleue nor regard) in handlyng the Gosspell, we wil haue litle consideration of them, but wil make it frutfull vnto our selues, lest we should suffer it in vayne to be put in writyng, and should leese the frute & commodity thereof. Which if we consider well, we shall perceiue that it contayneth matter very comfortable and ioyfull, seruyng much for our commodity. Which consolation and comfort is very nedeful for vs, seyng the signes of them selues are very terrible and (as I may say) horrible to behold.
            Moreouer, Christiās as they are at other tymes fearefull enough, & of base courage, so whē they see the indignatiō and wrath of God towardes mākind, the waggyng of a leafe is able to make them amased,Example hereof are the inhabitantes of Hierus

Whereof som they re garded not▪ some they enterpreted to signifie victory ouer theyr enemies cōtrary to the true meanyng of them, and of God which sent them▪ and contrary to the expresse wordes of our Sauiour which before had foretold them. and almost dead for feare: cōtrarywise the wicked are more



secure and hard harted, and are moued with no signes, be they neuer so great and horrible. Therfore this thyng seemeth not to fall out indifferently, and as reason would: for they which chiefly should be afrayd, whom God by his signes doth terrible threaten, they (I say) haue hartes of horne, stone, and yron, so that they regarde them as thoughe they dyd nothyng appertayne vnto them, what soeuer wrath of God was to come, & beyng euen now at hand,Luke. 14. 43 they do forewarne & shewe. ContrarywiseThe faithful haue no more cause to feare the signes of y• last day, the Noe had, when the flud came▪ or Lot at y• destruction of

                   company of them that then were preserued, is a signe of the little flock which goeth by the narrow gate. they which ought not to bee moued, but rather reioyce when they see these signes and tokens, as vnto them they do not portend any wrath or displeasure of God, but fauour & consolation, they (I say) feare more thē nedeth, and can scarsely lift vp



theyr harts to cōceaue such swete and comfortable cogitations as thereby occasion is offered.
            Now to come to my matter, there are two thyngs chiefly to be noted in this Gospell: The one is, that our Sauiour reckoneth the signes in order which go before the last day, which being fulfilled,Math. 14. we may know for a certainty that the day is euen hard at hand. The other note is, that he sayth those signes shalbe a consolation and a comfort to hys Christian children, so that therby they may be moued to looke for hys commyng with a mery and cherefull countenance. The first signe (sayth he) shall appeare from heauen in the sunne, y• moone, and the starres: that is to say (as Mathew doth expoūd it:) The sunne shalbe darkened, and the
               Math. 24. 29. 
               moone shall not geue her light, and the starres shall fall from heauen. &c. Moreouer vpon the earth the



people shalbe at theyr wittes end thorow dispayre, & shalbe in such perplexitye, that they shall not know whether to go, or where to abyde, their hartes shall fayle thē for feare of those thynges, which are like to come vpon them.
            Agayne, signes shalbe seene in the Sea, & in the Waters, so that all creatures, and the powers of heauen shall moue: there shalbe such an alteration, that the world shall seeme by and by to haue an end, and the last day shall seeme hard at hand. Here I will not greatly contend with any mā, but will leaue it to the consideration of my Christian brethrē, whether the signes in ye sunne, the moone, and the starres be already fulfilled, or not. But this is my belefe & most certaine hope, that the greater part of them haue bene already sene, and that many other are not here after to bee looked for.



For if we will beleue, there hath bene sene euen in our time aboundantly both many and great Eclipses or darkenyngs of the sunne and mone within few yeares together, one after an other, besides diuers in one yeare: the lyke we haue not read to haue appeared at any time before since the begyn nyng of the world. But he that will not beleue the word of God, will not beleue y• signes, nor take them for signes, but will cōtemne them, and tread them vnder hys foote, yea although ye sunne should be dayly darkned before his eyes, & the starres should fall by heapes from heauen. Although Astronomers say that such darkenynges of the sunne and moone happen by y• course of nature (which some of them can tel of before hand) yet they deny not, but they signifie some terrible thyng to happen on the earth, especially seyng there be



so many, & all most euery yeare.
            Besides this, contrary to the course of nature, many signes haue bene sene in the Heauens, many Sunnes at one time, many Raynebowes, many terrible blasyng Starres, fyres in the ayre like dartes and swordes, and diuers other prodigious sygnes, which if they should be written, would fill a whole volume: but all are forgotten, if they be not dayly before our eyes, and assone as they are past, we liue securely as though no such thyng had euer happened at any tyme: yea rather the oftener they happen, so much the lesse we regard them. For we take thē for customable thynges, thinkyng with our selues that of necessitye they must so come to passe, makyng no more accountes of them afterwardes. And true it is, that of necessity they must so come to passe, otherwise they



should be tokens in vayne, and the world should not bee so soone destroyed, if it beyng moued therby, should beleue the Gospell. For it might (turnyng to God by repentaunce) auoyde, or turne away his wrath▪ or at the least prolong it for a tyme. But alas, this is rather the chief care of the world, by continuyng in wickednes, & most obstinatly heapyng sinne, to hastē Gods wrath, and spedely to procure
                  •…
               hys owne destruction. Thus much as concernyng the signes in the Sunne, the Moone, and the Starres.
            Now as touchyng the signes in the Sea, and the Waters, I commit them in like maner to the Iudgement of my Christian brethren: Whether they be fulfilled al ready or no. Old men testify, that no man aliue is able to remember so great tempestes, windes, and floudes as haue happened within



these few yeares. Some floudes haue drowned whole countreys, such haue happened of late about Rome, and in the lower Germany: besides the earth quakes which we haue heard of, but I let them passe. By these thynges it semeth that such is now the condition of the world, that nothing shall continue any longer in hys old estate, but all things shall quickly be turned vpsidedowne, and fall to decay. And also this we see come to passe by many examples, that many are so troubled and vexed, that for very anguishe of mynde they dispayre. Which thyng may be vnderstanded both bodely and spiritually, but especially spiritually. For we haue heard of many before tyme, and yet dayly heare of mo, whom the deuill so troubleth and vexeth by temptations and desperation, that for the greatnes of the grief



and anguish, they lay hand vpon them selues, & procure their owne death: so that we see all the signes forespokē by our Sauiour Christ, haue happened in all the world. And although all thynges be not fully cōplished and ended, yet we can not deny, but that the greater part of them is already fulfilled, especially so many happenyng together one after an other. Therfore litle or nothyng hereafter is to be looked for besides the end of all thyngs, which signes are therfore forespoken, to put vs out of doubt, and that we should not thinke they happen without a cause by chaūce or fortune, rather thē to signifie some notable thyng to come. But they are in dede all of them terrible signes, threatening vnto the world cruell euēts, although it do not feele them, nor care for them. But true Christians do both see them, and marke them



well, & are therby terrified much more then nedes, seyng they are not sent to their destruction, but rather to their consolation: & therfore they ought with ioy & gladnes to behold & cōsider them, and not be discouraged, although the firmament appeare lamentable vnto the beholders, the Sunne, the Moone, the Starres and all the heauen beyng darkened.
            The Sunne, although he be couered with a thicke and blacke cloude, although he leese his light, neuerthelesse he goeth forwardes in hys course, he is no worse then he was before, he remaineth the same Sunne still, and shineth as he dyd before, sauyng that he lowreth for a time in token of destruction to wicked men: in lyke mader ye residue, as the Moone and the Starres, in that they seeme terrible to behold, it is no harme vnto them selues: For they are no



tokens vnto them selues, but vnto the wicked world, of whō they are contēned. After the same sort, whereas mē are troubled and vexed, hauyng a timerous & fearefull consciēce, it is in dede a terrible signe, but not vnto thee or thē which suffer this, if they be Christians: onely it signifieth destruction to the wicked, and despisers therof, which do not suffer it, but neglect it: For the sufferers are preserued neuerthelesse, and take no harme therby, although they go vp and downe with a pensiue mynde; in token of destruction to the wicked, and vngodly persons. Euen as Esay went naked, and without shooes, and Ieremy caryed a chayne about hys necke for a signe of misery and calamity to the Egyptians, and Philistines, and yet no harme happened vnto either of them. For Ieremy remayned out of bondage▪ & thraldome,



and in as much liberty, as he was before, and Esay notwithstādyng hys▪ nakednes, kept still hys garmentes: So they which kepyng vnto them a good cōscience, do cary about them these tokens, shalbe without harme, and voyde of of all daunger, onely they declare vnto other, what shortly after shalbe their estate and condicion.
            For although they bee euill signes, yet they bryng no euill to them that cary them. Otherwise, he that hath the execution of condemned persons, would not cary the sword, or the axe, neither durst any mā cary a weapon: But thou which art a mansleaer and murderer take thou hede to thy selfe, for thou art lyke to go to the pot when the officer draweth foorth his sword. In lyke maner the fire, the gibbet, the halter, ye gallowes hurte not them selues, but bryng destructiō to theeues and robbers



which haue committed haynous offences: So before the last day there must be many men, whom the deuill troubleth and vexeth with greuous temptations, and so oppresseth them with anguish, that they cā not tel which way to turne them, or where to abide. Of which sort of men Gerson of Paris, and certain confessors haue written many thynges, especially in Monasteries. We haue had experience of them in whom hath ben tender and fearefull consciences. But let hym so vexe and terrify men, he shal not hurt them, if they be not such as God hath determined to terrify and condemne, as the wicked and the vngodly: but rather such as are fearefull, & tender of mynde, and would gladly receiue comfort, and turne vnto God, and can finde no comfort or relief, vntil God himselfe haue deliuered them out of the misery of



their afflicted consciēce, and haue cōforted them by hys word. Onely feare thou, & take hede, which beyng secure and mery, cōtemnest all thinges, wherby God threateneth thy destruction. Unto these signes, that appertayneth where hee sayth: Mens hartes shall fayle them for feare, and for lookyng for those thynges which shall happen vnto the whole world: that is to say, many shal be troubled in their myndes, that they shall go like mē amased, and as though they dyd presently feele the daunger that they see hāgeth ouer their heades, for feare: Wherof they are so vexed, that the greatnes of the grief, and anguish of mynde causeth thē to consume and pine away: Euen as sorow vseth to wast mans life, euen as a priuye consumptiō doth eate, or sucke the marow out of y• bones (as the wise mā wytnessethProu. 17. 22. in his Prouerbes.) These men



must feele these signes, not as tokens vnto them selues, but vnto them which are more worthy to feele them. But bicause thou doest contemne them, at length thou shalt feele more greuously, not signes, but those thynges which therby are signified, that is to say, euerlastyng terrour, feare, sorow, and hell fire. For if iust men suffer and feele these things in the earth for a tyme: What shall we say will become of them for whose sakes they are sent, and whose destruction God thereby doth threaten? Notwithstādyng they esteme thē no more then the paryng of theyr nayles: But are dayly worse and worse, vntill experience (alas to late) doth teach them. What folye and madnes was in their brayne, when they gaue them selues to all pleasure and voluptuousnes, to all kynd of worldly ioy and pastyme? Whiles iust men were vexed with



great sorow & anguish of mynde, consideryng the great & horrible plagues which God hath prepared for all disobedient, stubburne and stifnecked infidels and Antichristes. It is a very hard thyng to behold many so terrible and so horrible signes, which with no small feare shal amase the mindes of many (as Christ here sayth) and fil them with such sorow, and heauynes, that they shall seeme to be voyde of all consolation and comfort to those that see them. But if thou be a Christian, do thou not looke either vppon the externall signes of heauen, or the earth, neither vpon that which yu feelest thy selfe: but looke yu vpon the necessity, both of thy selfe & of the whole world, vnto whō God (as his vnfallible word doth testify) hath ap pointed such thinges. Except that day shuld come at y• length, I had rather I had neuer bene borne.
            
               For let vs consider what is now the estate and cōdition of the world, & how it dealeth with vs, and with the Gospell of our Sauiour Christ, most cruelly persecutyng the Preachers therof, by mē that are driuen headlong throughReade that discouery of the Spa nish Inqui sitiō for the further declaration of these wordes. the deuill, to deuise dayly mischieuous and vntollerable tormentes for the same purpose. They most wickedly cōtemne and despise the Gospell, they scoffe at it, they speake spitefull and blasphemous wordes against it, most sclaunderously, endeueryng therby all that they may, to deface the faythfull seruaūtes of Iesus our Sauiour.
            So vnthankefull is the world for the Gospell, such deadly & poysoned hate doth it beare towards Gods ministers, beyng more madGene. 4. 8.

Agayne on the other side, there is an infinite number of wicked mē, as Idolaters, prophaners of the Sabboth by seruyng theyr owne couetous & censual lustes, in stede of God, vayne swearers, drunkardes, rebels, robbers, & spoylers one of an other, adulterers, deceyuers, lyers, false witnes bearers, cursed speakèrs, voluptuous men and wemē, slaunderers, malicious, enuious, couetous, ambitious, and periured persōs: so that there can scarce be sene in all the world one token of discipline, reuerēce, feare, good maners, or punishment of malefactours.

Priuate men kepe no good lawes, but by compultion: Officers see no lawes kept, but in respect of their owne cōmoditie, & to that end many tymes they purposely breake good lawes: for bribes or for frendship, oppresse the



poore, and defeate them of theyr right, either by false Iudgement, or by delayes, & such other crafty conueances. Lawyers encorrage their cliētes (aswell him that hath the false, as hym that hath y• good cause) to go forwardes with the law, vntill theyr money be spente, and then they send them home to agree amōgest theyr neighbours. Clientes (such are their couetous and malicious myndes) some to enrich them selues, wil wrongfully by processe of law chalēge other mens goods: some to vexe & trouble other men, will by sutes in the law vndoe both them selues, and their neighbours. Rich men neglect the poore, and suffer them to perish for hunger. Poore men (a great nūber of them) are idle loyterers, & will rather by pryggyng and such like meanes shift for thē selues, then by honest labour get their liuing. Old mē in all kind of



lewdnes, are an example to the youth. Young men and maydes take an example of the most part which is wicked, rather then of the lesser part which is godly. Pa rents and masters do not instruct their children and seruauntes in the true fayth, feare, and woorshyp of God. They seeke the bodely health, and worldly profite of their Children, but theyr soule health and heauenly profite they regard not at all. Childrē and seruaūtes that are godly instructed, despise theyr teachers, and folow the deuilish entisementes of theyr lewd companions.
            Ecclesiastical persons that are in authoritie, seke more the maintenaunce of their owne honour and estimation, then the furtherance of the Gospel. They seke not the encrease of godly preachers in their Diocesses, nor the reformatiō of such as are idle, and vngodly:



yea they suffer theyr owne families at home to be full of dissolutnes, much more their Dioces abroad. They admit into the ministery all maner lewd & vnlearned persons: They able not vnto one onely, but vnto many benefices, those that are both vnable, & vnwillyng to discharge one, or to take any paynes at all in the vineyard of God: yea many boyes that are neither Ministers, nor fit to enter into the Ministery. Priuate Ministers are some of them, idle loyterers, domme dogges, hyrelynges which suffer the wolfe to deuoure their flocke, feeders of thē selues, and not of Christes sheepe committed to their charge. Other some (takyng vppon them to be Preachers, not so much inwardly as outwardly called therunto) in preachyng the Gospell, preach them selues, and not Christ, as mē not endued with the spirit of God



(which without parciality reproueth all the world of sinne, rightuousnes and Iudgement) they rebuke some of lower sorte, and flatter such as are able to do them a pleasure. They preache many times sound doctrine, but by their wicked lyuyng they bryng it in contempt, and are therby cause of more offences, thē if they had spoken nothyng at all. They speake many tymes of them selues, and not that which they haue heard in the Prophetes and Euangelistes, and writtynges of the Apostles, but their owne fantasies. They do not glorifie Christ, but thē selues: For they take not that which is Christes, but that which is their own, & declare that vnto the people. The most part of the people heare not the word of God at all, but either absēt thē selues from y• Church, or els sodenly departe, before they haue heard the Scriptures



read, or any part therof expounded. Generally all sortes of men, the more they are instructed by the word of God, the worse they are, & cā not abide in any case to be reprehended and rebuked for their wickednes.
            So is the word of God, & hys law troade vnderfoote of all degrees, and ye true preachers therof receaue no other reward of mē, but scoffes, and mockes, and deuilish hatred, which is very greuous to good Christians, and pearceth the hart lyke a sword. Ought we not therfore to pray day & night, & cry vnto Christ our Lord, that now at the length he will vse hys seueritie, and suffer all thynges to come to ruine, that such detestable wickednes may haue an end, and that all occasion of offence, all snares and stoomblyng blockes,1. Cor. 15. 19. may be quite taken away? For except at length we should be preserued



from these thynges, we were of all men that euer were borne most miserable. For we must not so much consider the harme & destruction of the world, nor the misery of y• wicked worldlynges, but how great a grief it is to vs, & to all Christiās to seé God hym selfe & hys word contemned, reproued, & blasphemed, and hys preachers most spitefully hadeled, iniuriously trode vnder foote, and most cruelly tormented in the world: all preaching, crying out agaynst wickednes, rebukes, admonitions, and threatnynges are allmost vnprofitable, & in vayne.
            Therfore y• beholdyng of these signes aforesayd, ought much to reioyce vs, as by the which almighty GOD declareth, to our great comfort, that he will fight shortly with the world, and will deliuer vs out of all our miseries and calamityes. Therefore it is

They were wonderfully deceaued of their expectation, For they did not finde the godly Emperour such a mā as they would, nor as they thought they should.

And why shuld not we put much more trust in our true Sauiour, which hath not onely most certainly promised to come shortly, and deliuer vs, but also can and will performe hys promise? He will not deceaue vs (for he is no lyer at any tyme) especially when we looke for hym with a good confidence, sufferyng all thynges for his sake, in a iust quarell, which is not ours, but his owne, and not triumphyng lyke them: Which puttyng theyr trust in Caesar, hope for the confirmatiō of their haynous and mischieuous actes.
            Yet it is more conuenient for vs to reioyce and say: O what an excellent golden world shall that be, when our true Sauiour shall come, and shall quite abolish at once all wickednes & all iniuries which we must suffer for a tyme,



and shall make an ende of all miseries and calamities? Neither shall the Gospell nor hys holy name be neglected, or blasphemed any more. The preachers therof, which now are poore and nedy, shalbe no longer trod vnder foote, neither shall they suffer any more persecution: neither shall there bee afterwardes any more theft, robbery, spoylyng, iniury, false accusations, fornication, lying, crafty conueyance, flattery, periury, adultery, murder, treason, all these thinges (which now almost euery man doth commit without punishment, or rebuke) shall cease. And we finally shall be deliuered from all euill, so that we nede not to feare the world, sinne, death, hell, nor the deuil: For euerlastyng saluation, peace, tranquilitie, and ioy, shall reigne ouer vs. And ought not we with most feruēt prayer to desire these thinges?



If we could see perfectly how we are compassed euery where with an infinite nūber of deuils: Which euery moment of an houre ayme, and shoote at vs with their venemous darts, and all entisements, and prouocations to sinne: then we would pray dayly, kneelyng vpon our knees, yea and would weepe bloud, desiryng God to make an ende of this miserable lyfe.

(vnto whō nothyng is vnknowē) prognosticateth to be tokens of all goodnes.
            Amongest all other he vseth this most comfortable word: your redemption, which euery faythfull man, with all his hart doth desire most earnestly. For what els meaneth this word: your redemption, but that thou, which now art in bondage, vnder the dominion of the deuill, who setteth vpon thee with all kynd of wicked dartes, & bendeth all his force agaynst thee, that yu, I say (which art oppressed and ouerwhelmed of y• world with many miseries, in daunger of all misfortune, out of the which no earthly creature is able to deliuer thee) shalt now be deliuered and saued by Christ thy Lord, and placed there, where thou shalt raigne as Lord ouer the world, death & the deuill?

If God by his diuine power, should take thee beyng in this case away sodēly, and deliuer thee from thē: or if thunder and lightenyng from heauen should at once ouerthrow and strike downe to y• groūd, all thy enemyes with their daggers, swordes, speares and gunnes: Wouldest thou not reioyce with all thy hart? If a poore prisoner, which vnder a rigorous & cruell tyraunt hath lyued a long tyme, in a filthy and stincking prison,



besides the sufferyng of many other cruell tormentes: if such a man (I say) should heare, that hys owne Prince would come to deliuer hym, & by force of armes take hym out of so great miseries and calamities: How would he be affectioned in his mynde trow you, if hee should see hym commyng with a mighty armye of men, and with gunnes, strikyng downe the walles of y• Castle where he lyeth? No doubt it would be a terrible sight to all the residue therin abydyng: But vnto this prisoner it would be very comfortable & ioyfull. The noyse and roryng of the gūnes would much more delight hys eares, then any musicall harmony of swete songes, or pleasant instrumētes. That day (no doubt) he would celebrate with much solēnitie, geuyng God thankes that he had lyued to see that ioyfull houre.
            
               Euen so ought we to do when we see these signes mentioned by our Sauiour Christ in this Gospell. If fire, water, thunder, and lightenyng fall from heauen so thicke, and with such abundaunce as though all thinges in a momēt should vtterly be destroyed: We must thus thinke with our selues, that it is the prouision and ordinaunce of God our Kyng & Captaine. Wherby he destroyng and ouerthrowyng the prison house, will deliuer vs, which are kept bound in the kyngdome of the deuill, vnder sinne, afflicted of the world with manifold miseries & calamities. Wherfore then should we be afrayde, when we see these thynges? Why should we not rather ioyfully suffer al maner of tormentes, wherwith the world, and the deuill molesteth vs, that our redemer may come the sooner, & deliuer vs? For without his comfort



and consolation, we were of al men (as I said) most miserable, and might well wish that we had neuer ben borne, and that we had no God at all. Therfore let vs cō
               fort our selues with these ioyfull cogitations, knowyng for a certaintye that our deliuerer will come, and that these signes are (as I may terme them) his Haroulds of armes, wherby he giueth to vs to vnderstand, that he him selfe is not farre behynd.
            In the meane season, although in the world we be tossed, vexed, and afflicted with many stormes, thorow the intollerable wickednesMath. 27. 34. of vngodly mē: although they geue vs vineger mixed with gall to drinke, bysides other dayly misfortunes, as sickenes, pestilence, dearth, & warre, which are greuous to the body, or to the outward man: yet we must suffer and abyde all these thynges with patience:



We must be contēt to drinke this bitter drinke for a time, that y•
               The commoditie of affliction in this world. swete drinke which hereafter shal be geuē vs, may be the more pleasant to our tast, and that we may therby be moued ye more earnestly to pray for the cōmyng of our true sauiour: otherwise we should behaue our selues like sauage & wild mē, which bereaued of their wyt, haue no perseuerance of the daunger that hāgeth ouer their heades: euen like the secure and carelesse world which knoweth not how to repent, yea we should be drowned in ye desire and loue of worldly honor, wealth and pleasure, & at the length cast of all care of Gods word, and vtterly perish with the wicked world.
            Therfore this bitter drinke is commodious vnto vs: For it breedeth in vs a saciety and lothsomnes of this life, and comfortably causeth vs to hope for a life, much



more excellent now, whē our true Sauiour shall come in ye cloudes,Mat. 24. 30. with power & great glory: Who shall deliuer vs from all daunger, receiue vs to him selfe into the life euerlastyng, then the which nothyng cā be more ioyfull. But vnto the wicked worldlyngs which set their whole delight vpon this lyfe, caryng nothyng for God, hys commyng shall not be very acceptable:1. Thes.

            And whereas this is no small grief to good Christians, to consider in their myndes such a great destruction of the world, whereby they trouble them selues for their sakes, which shall perish: our Sauiour by the wordes contained in



the latter part of this Gospell, withdraweth their myndes from such cogitations, mouing them to cōsider rather how necessary their owne▪ redemption is, then the great destruction of the wicked: which for their desertes, God of his iustice hath prouided for them. For they can neuer make an ende of persecutyng the Gospell, which most contumeliously and blasphemously they spit at, cōtemne and scoffe, and rashly, iniuriously, and by force greue & oppresse the preachers therof: from which wicked purpose they can not bee withdrawne by any admonitions, intreatynges, rebukes or threatenynges. A man were as good speake vnto a stocke or a stone, as vnto thē, for they will not beleue, before they try by experience how wonderfully they were deceaued, and what punishment God hath prouided for such yron harted infidels.



They are so secure and careles, that what so euer happeneth,This saying of the wicked is after a sorte true: For the good preacher may bee a cause of trouble, first bycause where y• word of GOD is sincerelye preached, the deuill moueth and rayseth tumultes to suppresse it: secondly, where it is preached and not obeyed, the greater shall bee the plagues of the stubburne and stiffenecked people. terrible to ye eyes, or horrible to the eares, that they turne from them selues vpō vs, saying, that we are the cause of all miserie and calamitie, of all daūger, of all mischief. Finally when we haue done all that we cā do, by preachyng, praying, counsaylyng, yea and aduēturyng our owne liues to profite y• world, we are rewarded with vtter contēpt, hatred, enuy, and most crafty dealyng, which are able to make a mās hart to cleaue a sunder for sorow, and grief of minde.
            Therfore God cannot chuse (if he will beare any sway in earth) but once at the length let them see by experience, that his word and threatninges are true, which they scorne and iest at, and that he is



able to deliuer out of trouble hys Christian children most miserably afflicted. And bycause the childrē of the world do despise his Passion, death, and resurrection, and all thinges that he did or speake, with a secure and carelesse mynd: therfore once at the length they shall be terrified and feared, when we shall lyue pleasantly and ioyfully in euerlastyng lyfe.
            Therefore if thou haue any sparke of pitie in thy brest, take pitie rather of ye afflicted Christians, which must suffer so many miseries and calamities in the world: yea rather lament the state of the Gospell, and the most holy name of Christ our God, (in the which thou wast baptized, and called to be partaker of lyfe euerlastyng,) which the wicked worldlyngs do so vyly and blasphemously spit at, despise, treade vnder their feete, & reuile with most spiteful words.



What kynd of pitie call you this, to take pitie of these cruell murderers, hauyng an hart so stony that it cannot repent, which will not amend their life and make an end of their mischieuous actes, before they bee vtterly destroyed with their forefather Pharao, and such other as haue bene rebellious against y• maiesty of almighty god?
            I had rather tenne worldes should perish ten tymes, then one true Christian should continue in sorow and grief of minde for their sakes, which so outrageously contemne and despise Christ our Sauiour, and all Christian Religion. Therefore it is our parte to pray vnto God with a faithfull hart & feruent desire that his kyngdomeMat. 6. 10 may come. In like maner we had nede to wishe and pray that the world may be ouerthrowen and vtterly destroyed, which most arrogantly and blasphemously doth



set it selfe agaynst Christ and hys bloud, and can neuer make an end of his raging fearcenes, and cruel persecutyng of poore Christians. For so that forme of prayer which Christ our Sauiour hath prescribed vnto vs, teacheth vs courageously, and with confidēce to pray, that this day may come, and that we cry without ceasing vnto god, that once at the length he will be reuenged on those wicked and desperate verlettes, for the spitefull handlyng of hys holy and precious bloud.
            No Christian man ought or cā pray otherwise then thus, especially such as are molested and afflicted for the confession of Christ, and preachyng of the Gospell and kyngdome of God: who haue no other refuge on earth, but feruent & faythfull prayer. He that is not thus affectioned in his mind, that he doth not desire y• last day with



all his hart: doth not yet vnderstand the Lordes prayer, much lesse can he say it with his hart. As I by experiēce did once plainly perceaue in my selfe, at what tyme I was more delighted with other formes of prayer deuised by mās braine, then with that which our Sauiour himself hath taught vs. But to him that is oppressed with the miserie and calamitie of this world, it will seme a swete prayer, such a man will say it with all his hart. For who in such a case will not desire, and pray most feruently,Mat. 6. 13. that we be deliuered from euill, to the end all plagues, vexations and troubles of the world may haue an end, seyng we see the world will remaine as it is?

or rather dayly encrease more and more in wickednes.
            Therfore of all thinges this is the best, withal spede possible to departe out of it. For here we liue euē as it were in a den of theues, and manquellers, and can hardly, no not at all, sometymes defēd our selues from violēt iniury, and losse of life. Therfore for myne owne part I care not what shift I made honest and lawfull to ryd my selfe out of the world. For (as S. Cyprian sayth) who can haue any delight to liue in so filthy and troublesome estate, and condition, beyng as it were beset about with swords and daggers, ready drawen agaynst vs, so that it seemeth vnpossible to escape, if we had a thousand liues? Who in this case can be mery, before he see some man come to deliuer hym? But we are they which are in



this case, as we may easily vnderstand, if we consider well our estate, and condition, our misery & calamity, the daunger that hangeth ouer our heades, how busyly the deuill goeth about to entrap vs, how fiercely he setteth vpon vs, and how we are constrayned with great payne and trouble to award his most bitter, and venemous dartes, so that we can neuer haue rest.
            What els therfore should we desire, but that withall spede we may be deliuered out of these vntollerable greuaunces and daungers, which is, by the comming of our true Sauiour to iudgement at the last day? which who so euerThis is a a true saying, that we can not pray faythfully, nor beleue in god a right excepte we ioyfully,

               that beleueth, shall be saued: and he that beleueth not, shall be damned. Faith therfore is (as I may terme it) the onely staffe wherupon we must rest in this our pilgrimage, beyng ouer laden with vntollerable burdens of sinne and daūgers yt ensue thereof. Which staffe will do vs no seruice, except we take it in our handes, and vse it at all tymes conuenient. But we can not, nor will not streatch forth our handes to receaue it, except we be desirous therof. Again, except we desire those things which we are taught to beleue, it is a manifest argument, that we do not take them to be Gods benefites, and to



procede of his bountifull goodnes towards vs, which is the propertie of the true iustifiyng faith.
            Therfore I conclude, that we cānot well say the Articles of our faith, that is, we can not beleue a right in Christs cōming to iudgement, the resurrection of our flesh, and life euerlasting, except we desire that the last day may come, at what time our true Sauiour will put vs in full possession of these excedyng great benefites of his. Agayne, a man that hath no desire of the last day, doth not well vnderstand the ten commaundementes: For what meaneth it when he saith, I am the Lord thy God, thou shalt not take my name
               Exod. 20. 2 
               in vayne: thou shalt not steale, thou shalt not kill▪ thou shalt not commit
               Gal. 3. 24. 
               adultery▪ &c. but that we are in daunger of al these vices and wickednesses, and that such is our state and condition, that without



sinne and great daunger we can not liue: the deuill endeuoryng by all meanes to persuade vs, that we do not take God onely for our God, & by crafty meanes to withdraw vs from a quiet, ioyfull, and godly life. He setteth vp idolatry, raiseth vp blasphemy, and vnhalowyng of Gods name, he stirreth vp men to disobedience, sedition, wrath, filthy lust, robbery, theft, murder, and all kinde of wickednes. These incommodities who so euer seeth in deede, & would fayne be ryd of them, must nedes desire the last day, which is the tyme when all these, and such other miseries, and calamities, shall haue an end.
            Agaynst which the Lordes prayer was appointed and deuised by our Sauiour Christ as a remedy, especially where he hath taught vs to say: Halowed be thy
               Mat. 6. 9. 
               name, thy kyngdome come, Thy


               
               will be done, and deliuer vs from all euill. It remaineth therfore that we vse this remedy, hartely praying to God our heauenly father for these thinges, which we cānot throughly and perfectly receaue before the end of the world. For (as I said before) there is no hope of any better, then this miserable estate present, as lōg as the world endureth: especially in this our lat ter tymes towardes the end therof, it beyng now euen at the point to be cōsumed & vtterly destroyed for euer. For it is euen the deuils derling, past all hope of amendement, so yt all labour yt is bestowed vpō it, to any such end, is in vaine: Which we may euidently perceaue, considering how the word of God is dayly more & more contemned. Many kind of errours, pestiferous sectes, horrible wickednesses increase dayly, whereby the world is worse and worse



whiles we hope (but in vayne) for amendement.
            Wherfore then, in such miseries and calamities should we be greatly desirous of our lyfe? And if I for myne owne part had no great cause to desire the end of all things, yet the perill and daunger of my brethren, scattered here and there in the world, ought to moue me: for whose sake we haue good cause hartly to pray for it, whose state is such (as we both heare & see) that they are constrained to suffer all maner of ignominy, reproch, slaunderous wordes, both priuely and openly, violent iniury, and finally most greuous persecution what soeuer, with diuers kinds of tormentes, cruelly handled, and put to death.
            For how many euē in our dayes haue we sene, partly burnt openly, or by some such meanes made away, partly put to death, priuely



and by traiterous meanes dispatched? There are many, besides the infinite number of holy mē, which haue bene slayne before our tyme, since the Ascention of our Sauiour Christ, or rather since the beginnyng of ye world. Whose bloud beyng yet vnreuenged, cryeth for the commyng of our Sauiour to iudgement: to the end they beyng restored to their bodyes agayne, may haue full fruition of the ioyes lōg looked for, and may be reuēged of the world, as the reuelation of Iohn declareth: Where God comforteth them after this sort, saying: that they must rest for
               Apoc. 6. 10. 
               a litle season, vntil the number
               The Saintes of God do not require vengeance of theyr enemyes, bycause of priuate hatred, but bycause they know thē to be Gods enemyes, and do rage with deuelishe fury agaynst his holy Church, and agaynst hys euerlastyng truth. And in this case the loue of our neighbour hath no place, where it is repugnant to the loue of God. whose glory we ought to perferre before the commodities of all the world. Therfore when man is such an enemye vnto GOD, that we must needes hate the one, and loue y• other, we must loue God, & hate man. Psal. 139. 21. and in Gods cause pray for the destruction of man. Ier. 18. 11 ver. 21. as agaynst the enemy of GOD, vppon a zeale and feruēt loue of Gods glory, especially if they be such as we perceaue offende not of ignoraunce, but of malicious stubburnes and that agaynst theyr cō
                  sciēce. But in our own cause, as they are iniurious vnto our own persō, we must rather pray for man, then agaynst mā, as we are taught by the exāple of our Sauiour and Steuen. Act. 7. 60.

                  w seruaūtes and brethren, which should be killed in like maner, were fulfilled, which I hope is now come to passe.
            Therfore both the Christians that are lyuyng,



and those that are departed, after a sorte do desire vs to helpe them with our prayers, desiring God to hasten their redemption. For what thing can be more miserable vnto Christiās, then that they should be cōstrained alwayes to hold their tounges, the world and the deuill continually bragging and raging ouer thē, dayly putting to death and cruelly murderyng more & more of the faithfull professours of Iesus Christ & his vnfaillible word, and seducyng men, more and more encreasing these haynous offēces which before were vntollerable?
            We heare & see at this present, the Turke and the



Pope, which is Antichrist, rage with most cruell tyranny agaynst y• name of Christ, dayly sheddyng the bloud of his Saintes, with many sectes bysides, contrary to his Gospell: And should we, holdyng our handes in our bosome, looke vpon the deuill, practisyng without measure his crafty deuises agaynst the Christians, and not make our earnest prayer vnto God for them without ceasyng? There is no sparke of Christianity in a mans body remainyng, that would not pray vnto God withall his harte to be deliuered out of these so great miseries and calamities.
            Therfore if we haue a mynde to be Christians, we must endeuer our selues to pray diligently and earnestly, as our Sauiour hath taught vs, and as our necessity requireth, if it be any necessity: whē we see good Christiās with great



persecution slayne, true doctrine oppressed, the kingdome of the deuill, withall maner of vice & wickednes, aduaunced: Saintes, by the meanes of wicked men, not onely despised and troade vnder foote, but consumed to dust and ashes: finally the Gospell of Christ our Lord, and his name spitefully blasphemed.
            Therfore let vs call vpon God all that we may, desiryng him for the glory of his name, to take vppon him the defence of hys Christian children, and of his owne doctrine, and bryng them, by hys commyng at the last day to iudgeHe

            Let vs suffer therefore the Sunne, the Moone and all creatures to lowre, and to threaten terrible thinges to come: For although they bee terrible vnto the world, they are ioyfull vnto vs, which in them see that cōfortable deliueraūce, which our Sauiour by y• wordes of this Gospell hath declared vnto vs, and which he expoundeth vnto vs by this godly parable, or similitude folowyng: See (sayth he) the figge trees, and all other trees, when they shoot out their buds, you see and know of your selues, how that Sōmer is thē nigh at hand: so likewise ye also whē see these thinges come to passe, be sure that the kyngdome of GOD is nigh. Doubtelesse this is a notable exposition, which I my selfe could neuer inuent, or apply vnto



this purpose. For who euer herd, that the darkenyng of y• Sunne, and the Moone, the destructiō of the heauē and earth, the feare and tremblyng of men, the ruine of the ayre, water & all creatures, should be likened to the shootyng out of buds, and y• blossomyng of trees? I would thinke rather that these thynges should bee lykened to a rough, sharpe, and very hard winter, which with vntollerable cold destroyeth and kylleth all frutes, and what soeuer groweth vpon the earth.
            But our Sauiour Christ of all other the best interpreter and expounder of his word, expoundeth these signes after an other sorte, better to our comfort and consolation: shewyng that those thynges which seeme terrible vnto vs, are pleasaūt and beautifull to behold: as if we see the Sunne and the Moone darkened, the water and



the wyndes stormy and tempestuous, the mountaines ouerthrowē & made equall with the valleyes, he teacheth vs to say: thankes be to God, for now the pleasaunt som

               s at hād, now we see the spryng of the leafe in some trees, and other some to shoot out theyr buddes.
            No man, no reason, no humane wisedome, could thus interprete these signes, terrible to behold, that redemption and euerlastyng ioye should be signified thereby, which vnto reason, & mans wisedome seeme rather to prognosticate death and all kind of destruction. But seyug we haue learned this interpretation of such a notable scholemaster, euē of him which sendeth them, and therfore knoweth best how to expound thē: therfore (I say) let vs learne it well, & accustome our selues vnto it, that we may print it in our mindes the



better to our comfort, and that we may behold these signes, and geue our indgement of them accordyng to the word of God: and not according to reason and mans wisedome, which is foolish, and

Euen as the yerbes which in the wynter tyme lye hid in the earth, and the trees, the iuyce therof beyng kept in with cold, can not spryng and bryng forth buds, blossomes, and leaues, but looke for the spryng, at which tyme shootyng out their buds, they florish, and are liuely to behold: so we in lyke maner ought with ioy to looke for the iast day, saying: Now the sharpenes of wynter is ended, the pleasaunt sommer is come, yea such a sommer which neuer shall haue end.

see) crying (as it were) vnto God for their deliueraunce.
            For this cause our Sauiour Christ concludeth after this sort: So you, when you see these thynges come to passe, know that the kyngdome of God is at hand. Verely I say vnto you: this age shall
               Here an age may be taken for the space of two thousand yeares, whereof there are but thre in all the world, one frō the beginning of the world vnto the law, the secōd frō the law vnto the cōmyng of our Sauiour, and the last from the commyng of our Sauiour vnto the ende of the world, which shalbe shortened. But how much it is vncertain. 
               not passe, vntill all thynges be fulfilled: heauen and earth shall passe, but my word shall not passe. As though he should say, you haue prayed after this sorte: Let thy kyngdome come, deliuer vs from euill: Therfore now know you for a certainty, euen as certainely as my worde is true and euerlastyng, that when you see these sygnes, your prayer is heard, that the kyngdome of God shall come euen as you haue desired: and all sinne shall haue an end, and be consumed. &c.
            
               Therfore when I come in the cloudes withall my aungels, with great glory in flaming fyre, wherwith all creatures shall melt and be consumed, and all thinges shall geue alyght, and shyne after a straunger and wonderfull sorte: your bodyes shalbe glorified, so yt they shall passe the purenes of the ayre, and all the army of heauen, shyne they neuer so bright, and shall raigne with me for euer in vnspeakable glory. Finally, you shall see the wicked vnder your feete naked in the earth, in perpetuall shame, tremblyng and shakyng, beyng accursed and cast downe headlong into hell.
            Now to make an end, after this sort, as I haue declared vnto you, the signes of the last day must be expounded vnto the Christian people, that it may appeare they signifie no harme, but marueilous ioy, great profite, and commodity.

               Anno Domini. 1452. Constantinople in Grece (where in those dayes was the Emperours Palace) was besieged & ouercome of ye great Turke, called Mahomet the second of that name: who when he had gottē the victory, vsed most beastly cruelty towardes the Christians, both men, women, and children, old and young, rich and poore. The Emperour beyng slayne, hys head was set vpon a speare, & caryed round about the Citie, (ye more to greue his subiectes) hys wife and daughter, with many noble women were rauished, and after cut in péeces, all the noble men were slayne, the common people were made bond slaues, and many other such lyke vilanies were done, bysides the bryngyng of the whole countrey of Grece into hys owne dominion. A little before which tyme, was sene at Comus, a Citie in Fraunce, towardes Sunne settyng, a great multitude of



dogges, caryed in the ayre, and after thē droues of diuers kyndes of beastes: also men armed diuersely, some with speares and shieldes, who were pursued of a great army of horsemen, beyng deuided into diuers cōpanyes. For the space of thrée houres the army séemed to be settyng forth, at the last came forth a tall and huge man, fearefull to behold, sittyng vppon a terrible horse, séemyng to bée the Capitayne of the host: and many such straunge thynges appeared, vntill nyght when they could be no more sene.
         
         
            THese few examples I haue here added in the end of the Sermon, to let men see that before great alterations or channges of kyngdomes and common weales, God sendeth wonderfull tokens therof, to signifie the same before it come to passe: whereby with Martin Luther, the author of this Sermon, we may well conclude that before the alteration of the whole world (which is the last day) he will send many signes and tokens therof, which he sheweth for the most part to be already fulfilled: and therefore the end of all thynges is now to bee looked for,



bycause there hath happened of late dayes many wonderfull Eclipses, or darkenyngs of the Sunne, and Moone, many Sunnes haue bene sene at one tyme, many rayne bowes, many terrible blasyng Starres, and other straūge sightes of fire in the ayre, many great tempestes of wyndes, with flouds and earth quakes, which haue destroyed and ouerflowē both Cities, and whole countreyes: Wherof here might be added diuers examples, both of such as happened before Luther did write this Sermon, as also since that tyme. But they are almost innumerable, and haue bene partly sene with our owne eyes, and are at large set out in Print, by Conraedus Gesnerus, Marcus Fritschius, and others, who haue written no small bookes of such wonderful and straūge thynges, as by the prouidence of almighty God haue happened before tyme: to this end, that we seyng these thynges come to passe, forespoken by our Sauiour, might the more diligently watch for hys commyng, least we folowyng the example of the lewde seruaunt, leade a carelesse lyfe in all kynde of wickednes, and he commyng
