            TO THE RIGHT
NOBLE, THE SONNES
of the most High, his blessed
Brethren by the best,
that is, the second
Birth.
            
               TRuly Honorable, whose
Father is God, and
whose Inheritance a
Kingdome; the diuers sparks of
holy fire, which haue issued from
the Spirit that baptizeth with
fire, I haue gathered together;
by their vnited heate, to kindle
a flame where is none, or to increase
it, where it is alreadie
kindled. This blessing must
come from God, and therefore
of God haue I desired it. And

surely the best, as ye well know,
haue turnes of winter, euen vpon
their hottest zeale, and then
woe to him that is alone, for how
should he haue heate? Therfore
if in the time of cooling, some
spirituall worke be ioyned to the
heart, it may bee warmth will
grow betweene them. So haue
I often from Elisha applied,
euen some Prophet of God, receiued
life; and I wish, that
some quickning may proceede
also from this worke; which in
all writings is more or lesse, as
the Spirit therein more or lesse
speaketh.
            These Meditations are indeede
diuers in their matter,
being diuersly borne, both in regard
of time and occasion; yet
tend they to one ende, and this
profit often comes from variety,

that some one thing among many,
fitteth euery one, and giues
an answere to the particular
question of his heart. The glorie
of God by your benefite, is that
which I seeke, desiring also to be
holpen by you, both in prayer
and exhortation. As for an idle
name, made vp still, of perishing,
and often of corrupt breaths, I
leaue it to them for an end, to
whom God is not an end sufficient.
But let our chiefe ioy and
glory be to glorifie God, and by
being written in heauen, to bee
admitted vnto the beholding of
his glory. To that mark, my beloued,
let vs steadily aime, and
sending our hearts before vnto
Christ, let vs goe on lustily
to ouertake them. Let vs
draw hard vp the hill toward
heauen: and though the flesh

presse downe, the world and Satan
draw backe; yet strengthened
by the Spirit, incouraged by
the word, and fortified with the
mutuall and vnited force of
mightie loue, let vs carry the
Arke of God, euen the soule
(wherein Gods Image dwells,
and his will is written) from the
Countrey of the Philistims, to
the Land of promise. And
though heere our fleshly brethren,
Ismael and his heires,
mocke and despise vs, though
Esau with his foure hundred
men looke big vpon vs: yet are
we sure that their time is short,
and but for life; whereas wee
haue an inheritance eternally
glorious. Thither the sonnes of
the flesh, though with long pedegrees,
and large treasures, can
neuer enter; but sitting without,

where is weeping and gnashing
of teeth, they shallsee despised
holinesse, triumph vpon magnificent
and powerfull wickednes.
God our strength, whose cloud
and pillar guided Israel to Canaan,
guide vs to the heauenly
Ierusalem, by the grace of his
Spirit. This I humbly desire
through Christ his first borne,
the purchaser of our inheritance
and doore of all the mercy
that issueth from God
vnto man.
            
               One of your least worthy
brethren, but a great
louer of you, and
your peace.

            THe maine Faultinesse
of these Times, is a
Disproportion, betweene
Knowledge
and Action; or rather a
meere resting in knowledge
short of Action. So are we
come from no knowledge,
to knowledge alone, which
will not lessen, but increase
our iudgement; and from
the ouerualuing of workes,
to the Neglect of them.
Surely the errour of workes
without knowledge, is lesse
dangerous then the error of
knowledge without works:

But this is the best of it, it is
the doctrine of our Nature,
not of our Diuinitie. For
while it is taught, that
workes deserue not, some
are content to thinke they
are vselesse; others being
truly perswaded of their vse,
yet slouthfull to goodnesse,
lie down in knowledge, and
will not goe on to the labour
of action. But as hereafter
the paine will follow
the fault, so now let the
shame: for certainly it is a
great shame, that so much
knowledge should be idle,
and that skilful men should
sleepe in this Midday light;
for the light was made for
walking and working, not
for idlenesse. The Father
sheweth his will, because he

will haue it done; wee are
called to be sonnes, because
we should do the will of our
Father: and Nebuchadnezzar
giues the greatest title,
when hee calls the three
children the seruants of the
most high God. In the Spirit
wherein is Life, is also
Actiuenesse: If we nourish
not the actiuitie of it, we
decay the Life, & so kill our
selues with eternall Death.
Christ hath no dead or vnprofitable
Limbes, they all
beare fruite, or are not his;
and Faith which our slouth
would magnifie, by resting
in her, thrusts vs on for her
life to action; for shee liues
onely when she is actiue. If
then faith not working, bee
dead, and dead faith quickens

not; the vnactiue beleeuer
may speedily with a
Heathen see himselfe without
life. As these things may
driue vs, so the value of
workes may draw vs: for by
Christ who worketh them
in vs, they are accepted of
God, and haue a valuation
stamped vpon them, by his
Grace for Grace. And first,
though workes iustifie not
vs, they iustifie our Faith,
& in the day of iustice they
shall goe so farre toward iustifying
vs, that they shall
declare vs iust. In the meane
time, they please and glorifie
God, the giuer of such
gifts vnto men, and then euen
the least of them shall
haue a reward of glory,
which they shall set as a

crowne on their heads that
wrought them. Let vs not
therefore bee wanting to
this glorie belonging to
God from vs, and issuing
from God to vs. Besides, if
we will cōsider what works
are in themselues, we shall
finde that they are streames
of the Deity, their fountain,
and sparkes of that heauenly
and eternall fire. Accordingly
they present and expresse
something that is Diuine,
and supernaturally excellēt;
whence it was that a
Reuerend Ancient wel said:
The deedes and conuersation
of the Primitiue Christians,
had in them a perfume
and sweetnesse, wherwith
they exceedingly delighted
those with whome

they conuersed. And how
can it otherwise be, for whē
he that is blessednesse, and
excellence, powreth vertue
from himselfe into these
workes; they must needs
haue a resemblance & partaking
of their original. And
surely there are two things
in them, which as they are
the most pleasant of all other,
so they most resemble,
and approach to the Creator.
One of these is Light,
and the other is Loue; both
which put life and soule into
euery good worke. God
is Light, and God is Loue▪
and it is a pleasant thing to
behold the Light; and Loue
is as the precious oyntment
which was powred on the
head of Aaron. Wherefore

good workes beeing a Diuine
& heauenly off-spring,
let them bee highly respected
and carefully cherished
by vs. Againe, workes are
to vs strong euidences of the
Spirit of Life, and therefore
as sure as wee would be of
our saluation, so carefull let
vs be of good works: shamefull
it were for them who
are so scrupulous and eagre
for security cōcerning temporall
things, not to bee
more eagre for the ensuing
of their Election. Lastly,
they are excellent in regard
of the benefite they doe to
mankinde, which also is
manifold. They doe good
by the worke wrought, and
so they are as the dewe of
Heauen, which refresheth

and nourisheth the drie and
thirstie land. Surely to a
good Christian there is nothing
more pleasant then to
do good. For as he especially
delighteth therein, to
please his Maker, so he exceedingly
reioyceth, thereby
to profit his neighbour.
They doe good also by example,
for they come before
men as patternes; their
sound goes forth and tels
mankinde what should bee
done, what may be done;
and so they palpably perswade
men to be followers
of them, that are followers
of Christ. Againe, workes
doe good vnto men, while
they are mooued by them,
to lift vp their hearts and
eyes vnto the heauenly Father,

to glorifie him that giueth
such gifts to earthen
and corrupted vessels. And
whensoeuer God is glorified
by man, man that glorifies
him shall be blessed of
God; whensoeuer glorie is
giuen to God on high, peace
and good will shall be bestowed
on Men below. If
these things will not yet
mooue vs, at least, let vs preuent
the taking away of our
candlesticke & the remoouing
of it, to a nation that
will bring forth more fruite.
Let vs preuent the scandall
and shame, which we purchase
to our selues from the
enemies of our Religion.
Let vs preuent the vpbrayding
of Chorazin and Bethsaida,
Finally let vs preuent

that fearefull sentence: I
know ye not, depart from me all
ye workers of iniquitie. This
shall we doe, if wee becom
right Christians in whome
faith worketh by loue: For
the soule that is rooted in
Christ, hath from this root,
the life of Loue, Diuine, and
Humane, which expresseth
it selfe outwardly in the
fruite of good actions.
         
         
            2
            It is a great vnhappinesse
to many, that they mistake
good nature for grace: For
so doing they set vp their
rest in it, thinking they are
gone farre enough towards
God, because they wish all
well, & no hurt to any. But
it must bee knowne that
good nature at the best is

not grace, yea it is full of enmities
that fight against
Grace. For though it bee
somewhat apt and appliable
to the second Table, yet it
is euer far short of the first,
not hauing in it that true
knowledge & loue of God,
nor that inward purenesse
which therein is required.
So the obseruing of the second
Table, is faulty, for
want of the first; for if a
man do neuer so many seeming
good workes, if they
proceede not from a heart
truely sanctified by God,
they are glittering sinnes issuing
from a corrupt fountaine,
and tending to the sea
of death. For nature is exceedingly
blinde toward
God, neither beholding, nor

worshipping him as god, yea
it is peruerted from God, &
against God, & chuseth many
things to it selfe in stead
of God. Now that which is
blind cannot leade vs the
right way, and that which
straieth, leadeth vs a false
way, euen a way from life.
Therefore let-vs employ
our iudgements vpon our
owne estates, that we may
know whether there bee in
vs something more then
Nature, and by which Nature
it self may be rectified
and directed to the true
scope and marke, which is
God. If there be in vs this
godly and immortall seede,
let vs water it, let vs cherish
it, as the life of our life; if it
be not in vs, let vs violently

knock at the doore of heauen
with grones, with panting
desires, with vehement
supplications, vntill there
be an opening to our knocking,
a giuing to our asking;
and vntill they that
thirst may drinke freely of
the waters of life. Otherwise
if in a lazy contentednesse,
we lie along vpon the
streame of Nature, suffering
it to carry vs whither it listeth;
certainly it slideth along
to death, and all the
benefit wee can pick out of
it is this, that we go thither
pleasantly.
         
         
            3
            The goodnes of any worldly
thing which so much
pleaseth and moueth vs, is
but a spark of infinite goodnesse,

which dwells in God,
the author of it. If then wee
loue these small and transitorie
things with so great
an affection, proportionably
should wee raise our
affection (if it were possible)
toward God, as much
aboue it, as God is aboue
his creature. At least, let
the creature when it giueth
vs any comfort, bee a remembrancer
vnto vs of
God, pointing to him as
the Author of euery good
thing, and our soueraigne
Good.
         
         
            4
            Hauing vndertaken the
profession of Christians,
and considering in our
owne thoughts, the persecutions
and tentations that

may befal vs, or cōferring of
them with others, let vs not
promise to our selues or others
ouermuch strength or
constancy; let vs not promise
ouer confidently what
we will do, lest with Peter,
wee performe nothing of
that which we promise. For
the strength which must do
this worke of resisting and
ouercomming temptation
is not our owne but Gods:
and how canst thou promise
that which is anothers?
That which is ours, is onely
the strength of flesh and
bloud; now flesh and bloud,
bee it neuer so lusty, is no
match for temptations and
persecutions. Indeede the
spirits of men in prosperitie
are prompt and forward,

their imaginatiōs of themselues
are high, and they
dare boast of great things.
But let vs know that the
diuell ouercame man at the
best, and what may wee
not doubt of our selues, the
weake issue of man fallen
to the worst? Let vs therefore
rather mistrust our
owne strength, confessing
it to be weakenesse; and in
humility and confession of
our weakenesse, runne to
God, & call him our Rocke
and our strength. Let vs
say: By my God I can break
through an hoste, and by
him I can leape ouer a wall
of temptations. And that
we may obtaine God to be
our strength, let vs instantly
beg of him that Spirit of

Fire, which makes men
strongly to endure the fiery
tryall. Let vs pray to him
that he will continue to do
in vs, what hee hath bin accustomed
to do in others,
euen in infirmitie to make
his strength plaine and euident.
And that we may be
fully capable of the grace
we pray for, let vs present
our selues, as vessels empty,
and altogether voide, that
of fulnesse we may receiue
fulnesse. In summe, let vs so
speake, let vs so thinke of
our selues as holy Paul: In
vs, that is in our flesh, there
is no goodnesse, but wee
hope and desire to doe all
things through Christ that
strengthens vs, euen to be
more then Conquerours,

through Christ that loueth
vs.
         
         
            5
            All sorts of men propose
to themselues a happinesse
& hauing proposed it, they
seeke it with al their might,
neglecting all things in coparison
of it. The happinesse
of the Gentiles is
this world; and therefore
they striue toward it with
all their strength, neglecting
the kingdome of
heauen in regard of the
world. But the happinesse
of a Christian is the kingdome
of God, and setting
his heart thereon, he despiseth
the world in comparison
of it, and endeauours
wholly for faith and regeneration,
the meanes to

attaine it. Now the Christians
haue great aduantages
of the Heathen: For besides
that our happinesse is eternall,
theirs transitory; ours
increaseth a man, theirs addeth
nothing to man: wee
haue euen their happinesse
for an aduantage, though
not for an happinesse. For
this world was made for
the next, & whosoeuer haue
a right to the next, they only
haue a right to this, and
a promise that so much of
this world shal be added to
them, as is necessarie for
them, in their way to the
next. Hee that sets vs in a
Iourney, will giue vs foode
in the Iourney as hee did
Manna to the Israelites trauailing
to Canaan, & bread

and drinke to Elias, when
he was to go the great iourney
to the Mount of God.
Surely if the Creator giue
himselfe to vs, how shall he
not giue his creatures with
himselfe? Therefore as we
auoide the loue of the
Gentiles, so let vs auoide
their feare: as we loue not
the world, as our chiefe
good, so let vs not feare the
losse of the world, as a
chiefe euill; especially since
we haue a sure, stedfast, and
vnmooueable word, God
will not faile vs, nor forsake
vs. Surely they that know
thy name will trust in thee
O Lord; for they haue
seene and felt that thou
hast not failed them that
seeke thee.
         
         
            
            6
            The Sunne of the soule
is God: while shee is here
therefore without God, she
hath but her owne light,
which is but as the light of
the eye without the Sunne,
& is little more then blindnesse.
Let vs therefore still
aspire to that high and perfect
light, where the soule
looking out with open
sight, shall behold a Sunne
infinitely more passing this
Sunne, then the soule doth
the eye. In the meane time
let vs be farre from setting
our content on this dungeon,
where the soule dwelleth
in darkenesse; but in a
godly discōtent let vs striue
here, to get some ray of
that purest light, which

may guide vs through this
darkenesse, and from it, vnto
that glorious citie, wherin
God is the Sunne.
         
         
            7
            The nature of man being
subiect to passions, is
very apt to amend one vice
with another, and to runne
from one extremity, iust as
farre as another. The ciuill
and spirituall powers are
two, that may and would
well liue together, in mutuall
comfort and vnitie.
But in the first times after
Christ, the ciuill power
mightily destroyed, and diminished
the spiritual, hunting
the possessors thereof
as partriches on the mountaines.
After this the cleargie
hauing gotten power

enough at least to right
themselues, aduanced toward
the limits of the temporalty,
and at length inuaded
the very sword and
scepter thereof. This being
the disease of the cleargy,
it was mightily purged, and
now it concernes the Laity,
whose turne is next to
be faulty, to looke to it self,
that it continue not these
circular euils. Likewise the
Papists digged downe the
foundation, to build vp
the walles, they tooke from
Christ to magnifie workes.
Now let vs take heede that
we make not all foundation,
and so indeede make no
foundation; for Christ is
not a foundation to them
that build not vpon him.

The Popish Cleargie couered
their people with
blindnesse, and then gaue
them a line, which they
willingly followed; ours
desireth to guide and fill
vs with light: now farre
bee it from vs, so to hate
blindnesse, that we doe nothing
but stare on the light.
Light on earth is a guide to
light in heauen, but it is no
guide to them that doe not
follow it; yea to such in the
day of darkenesse it shal become
an accuser. But thogh
darknes should bring forth
more workes then light,
yet Hagar may not boast
against Sara, nor ignorance
against knowledg. For first,
these workes of ignorance
are the children of the

bondwoman, euen of our
naturall corruption; & therfore
shall not inherite with
the children of grace, the
freewoman, neither shall
they obtaine any reward.
Secondly, nature spreads ouer
all mankinde, but true
sanctifying grace comes into
few. Now superstition is
rooted in nature, and so is
generall with nature; and
therefore it is no wonder if
that which is general, bring
forth more general, and cō
               mon
fruits: neither if grace
which dwels but in the few
that enter in at the narrow
gate, makes the lesse muster,
and outward apparence.
         
         
            8
            A Christian man hath as
much neede of Christs Spirit
to be a Christian, and to

liue eternally, as a naturall
man hath of a Spirit to be a
man, and to liue temporally.
For as the soule and the
bodie are a man, so Christs
Spirit and man are a Christian,
which is a holy, eternall
and happy thing.
         
         
            9
            When a Christian hath
committed some notable
sinne, there presently open
before him two dangerous
gulfs ready to swallow him;
one of them is Despaire, the
other, Presumption. Hee is
tempted to beleeue, that he
cannot be forgiuen, or that
he is very easily forgiuen;
and so Gods mercy is too
much assumed or refused.
But against presumption,
should bee set as a counterpoyse,

the Maiestie and Iustice
of the great God that
is offended, the foulenesse
and deformitie of sinne in
the sight of that God, the
breach of the Couenant
made with God, both at
the outward, and inward
Baptisme; the grieuing of
the Spirit, with which wee
are sealed vnto redemption:
and finally, the temporall
punishments, wherewith
God chastiseth his
transgressing seruants, especially,
not iudging, humbling,
or chastising themselues.
Surely God is infinite
in Maiesty, the heauen
of heauens cannot containe
him, the Angels cannot fully
behold him, the Sun and
Starres are not pure in comparison

of him. The same
God, is a iust & iealous God,
visiting sin and iniquity: for
sin is more lothsome in his
sight, then the most abhorred
filthinesse, or foulest
soares, are in the eies of mē.
As for thy Couenant, thou
hast mightily brokē it: thou
gauest thy selfe to God in
generall, and now thou takest
thy selfe from him in
particulars: thou madest an
agreement with him to bee
his seruant, if he would bee
thy God; he is become thy
God, and thou failest in thy
promised seruice. Besides,
thou grieuest the Spirit,
that cōforts thee: thou art
a great vexatiō to him, who
is thy chiefe consolation:
thou frettest that which is

thy life eternall, and goest
about to quench him, who
would quicken thee vnto
glorie euerlasting. Lastly,
that the punishments of sin
may come within thy consideration,
remember Dauid,
for whose adultery and
murder, his child of adultery
died; his wiues were
polluted with incest, and
himselfe by his owne bowels,
was driuen from his palace
into the fields of the
wildernes. Remember Hezekiah,
for the lifting vp of
whose heart, the Treasures
must be carried into Babilon.
Remember the Corinthians,
of whom many were
sicke and many slept, because
they had sinned, and
slept in their sinnes. Wherfore

make hast, run to God
right early, acknowledge
thy sinne against thy selfe,
and humble thy selfe vnder
the mightie hand of God,
that in due time he may exalt
thee. That is the onely
right exaltation which is
done by God, and humiliation
of thy selfe is the onely
way to it: but an exaltation
of thy selfe without God,
will turne to an humiliation
by God, if not a confusion.
But if thou washest
away the pleasure of
sin, by the sorrow of repentance,
if thou washest away
the pollution and deformitie
of sinne, by cleannesse
of heart, and rightnesse of
Spirit, then mayst thou lay
hold on the satisfaction of

Christ to wash away the
guilt of thy sin, and so thou
art wholly made cleane. As
God will not haue his mercie
to bee made an encouragement
to sinne, so hee
will not haue his iustice to
bee a discouragement to
them that turne from their
sinnes: but iustice belongs
to the presumptuous to
humble them, and mercy
to the humble and broken
hearted to refresh them.
Come therefore thou that
art heauy laden, which feelest
thy sinnes as a burden
intolerable, take the refreshing
which belongeth to
thee; and looke not on the
terror of iustice any longer,
which belongeth to the
presumptuous, and not to

thee. God will not that the
reed brused by the Law,
should bee vtterly broken,
but that it be healed by the
Gospell. Gods aime in thy
humbling is not despaire,
but Faith, Hope and Loue;
his end is thy amendment,
and not thy torment. But if
thou doubtest that so great
a sinne hath cut thee off
from Christ, and therefore
thou darest not to make
vse of his merits, know this,
that by thy faith, which
made a generall surrender
of thee vnto Christ, thou
wast ingrafted into Christ;
Christ was thine, and thou
wert his. Now this Vnion
is indissoluble, nothing can
put asunder what God
hath thus put together. Besides,

Christ in his Vnion
with thee, did not wholly
take away thy wilde nature,
but powring in a godly nature,
left also some remainder
of thy former wildnes.
If then this wilde nature
bring forth the fruit of the
wilde oliue, it is no wonder;
for it is so left, that sometimes
when God hideth his
face, it may leade vs away
captiue vnto the execution
of sinne. Yet the Spirit of
Christ euen thē liueth in vs,
though in bondage, for the
time; and grace is then not
put to death, but only made
prisoner. The seed of Christ
remaines immortal, he is stil
in thee, though sometimes
thou bearest thy own fruite
and not his. A generall

dominion of sinne, excludeth
a generall dominion
of Christ: but a particular
sinne may yet leaue a generall
dominion to Christ.
Thou mislikest thy selfe because
thou art not holy in
all things: thou dost well to
loue and desire perfection;
yet though thou offendest
in some thing, doe not despaire,
for God hath not giuen
any man in this life so
much grace, as may giue
him a generall rest from sin;
he leaueth this world as a
place of battaile and combate,
and referreth perfect
rest vnto the world to
come. Now the same God,
though in iustice hee requires
a full obedience, yet
in mercy he accepteth according

to that wee haue;
& hee knowes we haue nothing,
but what wee haue
receiued, and we haue receiued
only so much grace,
as may exclude the dominion
of sinne, but not abolish
the being of it. Let vs
therfore not so much busie
our selues in superfluous
and vnprofitable vexation
of our own soules, as in the
study of purging our selues
from our sins, that wee may
bring forth more fruit. This
is it which God especially
lookes for after sin, and so
doing we shall vndeniably
proue to our selues, that we
are still the liuely branches
of Christ. A mans seruant
doth sometimes his owne
worke, yet if he presently

returne to the worke of his
Master, and makes that his
chiefe and maine employment,
he ceaseth not to bee
his seruant, since most hee
serueth him. So and much
more is it betweene Christ
and vs; We are his, though
somtimes seruing our selues
especially being held by
him, out of whose hand nothing
can take vs. Therfore
thou distressed soule, goe
thy waies, and indeuour to
sinne no more, and then
thy faith shall make thee
whole.
         
         
            10
            The diuell hath put the
world out of frame, & that
in two ouerspreading confusions;
One is sinne, the other
misery. Now Christ

came to vnloose the works
of the diuel, and performes
it both in himselfe and in
his members. His owne
part he hath fully perfected
in himselfe, and now it remaines
that we ioyne with
him to performe that part,
which is to bee done by
Christ in vs. Therefore against
sin, wherin the world
blindly walketh, let vs oppose
sanctification, seeking
to place it in the stead therof,
both in our selues and others.
Against misery let vs
employ the inward & outward
consolations which
God hath giuen vs, releeuing
refreshing, and encouraging
all distressed patients.
This must we doe, yet
we may not expect that the

worke shall bee perfected
vntill the great day come.
Then onely shall be a pure
separation of things now
confounded. Then onely
shall the sinne and misery
which now cleaue to the
Saints, fully be wiped away;
and then shall a kingdome
come, wherein holinesse,
and happinesse, lifted vp
farre aboue sinne and misery,
shall eternally dwell
together. In the meane
time we must patiently behold
many crooked things
which no man can make
streight, and yet we must
striue to reforme the crookednesse
that may be made
streight. Blessed are wee if
when our Lord commeth
he shall finde vs so doing;

wee shall haue our part in
the sentence of blessing,
and our workes of mercie
& righteousnesse shal praise
vs in the gates of heauen.
And the same Christ who
hath here wrought mightily
in vs vnto the perfecting
and aduancing of his kingdome,
shall there worke
maruellously for vs vnto
the aduancing of vs in his
kingdome.
         
         
            11
            There is great reason,
though it breed but little
practise, that we should put
the loue of the creature far
below the loue of the
Creator, the loue of things
perishing below the loue of
things enduring for euer,
the loue of things made for

vs, below the loue of him
that made vs, & for whom
we were made. With this
reasō, there is ioyned great
reward, for at last things
transitory will part from
vs, and the loue placed on
them; but God continues
for euer, euen after the other
haue forsaken vs, and
then rewards the loue built
on him with an euerlasting
loue: and on this loue attend
Ioyes vnspeakable,
and a crowne of glory Immarcessible.
         
         
            12
            Our knowledge in this
world▪ is little and imperfect,
but they that haue
Christ by vnion with him,
haue a perfect wisedome,
and are in him perfectly

wise. Let vs therefore esteeme
our selues, & others
more or lesse wise, as we are
more or lesse partakers of
that high and infinite wisedome;
and therein especially
let vs striue for Supereminence.
If in this litle and
narrow knowledge of man
wee only excell others, it
may bee a iust ground of
cōtempt against our selues,
rather then a reason of that
pride which is commonly
assumed, and imployed in
despising others. For those
whom this humane wisedome
despiseth, may haue
an assured Right in the Diuine
wisedome; which in
the foolishnesse thereof is
wiser then the wisest of
men: and which being wise,

approoues her children for
the most wise, for iustifying
of her; and which finally
shall raise vp her meanest
children in so true an image
of God, that in regard of
their new vnderstanding,
the Schoole-taught knowledge
euen of old Doctors,
shall bee ashamed of the
name of knowledge, and
shall appeare to bee but as
the rudiments of children.
Let Christ therefore be the
wisedome, by which mankinde
should be especially
measured, and valued; so
shall the iudging of them
be according to truth, not
outward appearance, we
shall iudge the iudgement
of God and not of man.
         
         
            
            13
            If any man haue done
some excellent worke, by
wit, learning or valour, we
ascend presently from the
excellencie of the worke, to
the excellencie of the worker,
imagining him to be a
fountaine wherof his work
is but a streame, and wee
earnestly desire to see the
more excellent cause, of so
excellent an effect. This is
the ordinary course of naturall
Men; yet is there a
most notable and incomprehensible
worke, the
worke that containeth all
humane workes, yea man
himselfe, and this worke is
daily seene; but few ascend
from the worke to consider
the worker, and much

fewer desire to see him, and
fewest of all wonder that
they doe not desire. Surely
to a rectified soule, it is a
great wonder, that for Atchieuements
small in comparison
of this great one,
wee should looke vp with
loue & admiration to their
cause; but for this huge
worke, we should not lift
vp our eyes and desires, to
the cause thereof, which
indeed comprehendeth, &
causeth all other causes. But
againe the same soule ceaseth
to wonder when it
lookes on the fall of man;
for therin it sees mans chiefest
corruption was in that
fleshly wisedome which
hath blinded vs to the
Creator, & makes vs broad-sighted

to the creature;
which hath put the head of
a beast into the heart of a
man, and makes him looke
downward with the beasts,
from the maker to things
made. But it is our part to
vnhood our selues as much
as we may from this vizard
of wisedome, and to iudge
of things according to
cleare truth, not blinde opinion.
Let vs pursue truth as
long as it lasteth, not so
long only as our muffled
vnderstanding doth naturally
and easily follow and
apprehend it. In this course
of outgoing nature, yet let
vs set our first foote in her
owne pathe: So on her
ground we fasten this, that
the Author is more excellent

then the worke, the
cause then the effect, and
therefore if it be pleasant or
glorious to see and know
the worke and effect, it is
farre more pleasant & glorious,
to see the cause and
author himselfe. But whereas
grouelling nature applies
this rule only to these lower
things, we knowing that
the truth thereof proceeds
further, yea reacheth especially
to the cause of causes:
let vs out-strip nature, and
follow this truth, vntill it
leade vs into an amazing
wonder, a feruent loue, a
longing desire, to see that
great producer of all excellent
workes; that infinite
being, from whom all this
masse of Creation hath his

Being, and who as farre exceedeth
in wisedome, power,
and glory, the created
wisedome, power, and glory,
as an infinite and indeterminable
cause, may effects
finite and determined.
         
         
            14
            If God haue reuealed a
truth to vs, which hath bin
long concealed, let vs not
seeke to haue our selues
proclaimed as the fountaines
of that truth, nor
draw followers to our
selues, but to it, and by it to
God. For God is the Author
and fountaine of all
truth, and of the reuelation
of truth; and so the truth
found is Gods, and the finding
of the truth, appertaines

to the grace of God.
Therefore let vs desire to
get glory to him, to whom
the glory indeede belongs.
And humbly thanking
God, that among many of
his excellent seruants, hee
hath vouchsafed to vse vs
in the reuealing of it; let vs
steale away our own names
if we may from the honour
thereof, leauing the whole
glory to the name of God,
whose worke it is. If thus
we draw men to the truth,
& by the truth vnto God;
not to Paul or Cephas, but
vnto Christ; this seeking
of gods glory with the losse
of our owne, will God reward
with infinite glorie:
whereas the setting vp of
our selues in Gods stead, the

iealous God will punish
with extreame torments, as
most odious idolatry. Yet
euen in this life to such
humble seers doth honour
belong, though not the honour
of fountaines, yet the
honour of cesternes, euen
the honour due to such as
God honours, by committing
to them his oracles
and secrets. And euen to
their humility belongeth
honour, for humility is
Gods way to preferment;
which though it takes away
the value of our selues
to our selues, yet as an excellent
grace it ought to increase
the same value, in the
sight of others as it doth in
the sight of God.
         
         
            
            15
            When there comes any
pleasure to be lost, or paine
to bee suffered for Gods
sake, let vs set vp a balance
in our hearts: in one scale,
let vs set the temporal pleasure
we lose, and in the other,
the eternall pleasure
we gaine by this losse; and
wee shall see the weight of
this latter to bee infinitely
exceeding. So likewise for
paine, let vs set the temporall
paine in one balance,
and the eternal in the other;
and wee shall see there also
the weight of eternal paine
farre to exceed that of the
temporall. Now if we vse
but our ordinarie iudgement,
of good things to
chuse the greatest, and of

euils to chuse the least, we
shal presently consent with
the losse of temporall pleasure,
to procure eternal ioy,
and with the enduring of
temporall paine, to auoide
paine eternall; especially,
since with the auoiding of
that eternall torment, the
exceeding weight of ioy, is
ioyntly procured.
         
         
            16
            There is a great craft of
Satan, which passeth too
much vnmarked, or vnresisted,
and this it is; That he
seekes by all meanes to
keepe his owne kingdome
whole and vndeuided, and
to diuide by schismes and
contentions, the kingdome
and body of Christ; that by
the malice of such contentions,

the flocke of Christ
may bite one another, and
consequently deuoure one
another, and so doe Satans
busines for him. But it behoueth
Christians to note
this his cunning, and with
detestation to beware, that
they be not Satans in struments,
nor become those
mad members which fight
and strike one at another,
and seek to teare that asunder,
which God hath vnseparably
ioyned together.
And lamentable indeed is
this madnesse and folly: for
the main busines of Christ,
effected by a bloudy death,
and bitter passion, is, to set
in vnitie and peace, the
things in heauen and earth.
Besides, he hath left as a legacie

to his Church, the
preseruation and continuance
of the vnitie which
himselfe began; As I haue
loued you, so loue yee one
another. Againe, Christ
hath prayed to his Father,
that we may be one, as hee
and his Father is one. Now
cursed is hee that goes about
to breake this three-fold
cord, and endeuours
to frustrate the death of
Christ, the cōmandement
of Christ, and the prayer of
Christ. But thou wilt say, I
diuide my selfe from him,
and oppose my selfe against
him, because he opposeth
himselfe against Christ in
some vncurable errour. But
take thou heed that this error
separate him frō Christ,

and remooue the foundation,
else thou canst not hate
him. For when men agree
in the sauing foundation,
they become one body and
one building, vnited vpon
that foundation, and vnto
it. Now when men acknowledge
Christ, in whom
is the Trinitie vnited to
man, to be happinesse, and
the onely meanes of happinesse,
euen the Doore, the
Way, and the Life; and to
this Christ wholly resigne
and surrender themselues,
to be iustified, to be sanctified
by him; these haue receiued
into themselues, the
roote of Life; they are one
with Christ, and one among
themselues. But that
these vnited members, because

one receiued this
faith of Paul, another of
Peter; because one beleeueth
something more, another
somthing lesse in matters
not absolutely necessarie
to saluation, nor directly
ouerthrowing the foundation;
should mutually
hate and reuile one another,
should shunne mutuall
conuersation, should prosecute
and persecute one another
with enuenomed
tongues, is most vnreasonable
and lamentable. Is not
the solide vnion betweene
them a more cause of loue,
then the slight difference a
cause of hate? Nay, will
Christ allow, that there is
any cause sufficiēt, to make
his members hate one another,

whom he hath tied in
the bond of peace, by such
mighty knots? Especially
right lothsome is it to him,
to haue his name vsed for a
pretence of such hatred,
which aboue all names, is
the name of loue and peace.
Surely Christ knowes, that
when men in this kind pretend
to serue Christ, they
indeede serue Satan. Hee
knowes that vnitie is the
preseruation of his kingdome,
and diuision, the destruction
of all kingdomes.
Therfore if thou wilt please
Christ, preserue his Kingdome
by preseruing vnity;
it pleaseth not the head, to
haue his member, brused,
bitten, or hurt. He allowes
not the member of greater

knowledge, to bee proud
ouer a member of lesse
knowledge, much lesse to
make their difference of
knowledge, a ground of
hatred. He himselfe forgiues
this ignorance and errour,
for which thou hatest thy
brother, and offers vp his
bloud to the Father that he
may be forgiuen. Yea hee
loueth this brother notwithstanding
his error, and
what art thou then to hate
one whom Christ loueth?
Euen thy selfe also (though
perchance thou thinke it
not) art by Christ, borne
with, and forgiuen for greater
errours and ignorances;
for of thee and vs stil, Christ
knowes this to be true, that
yet wee know but in part.

Therefore thou that pretendest
to please thy Head,
bee truly conformable to
him, and thou shalt indeed
please him. Loue where he
loues, and beare with him
with whom he beareth. Obey
that new commandement
of his, That yee loue
one another. Expresse this
loue in instructing thy brother,
if he be ignorant; and
hate him not, though he be
so weake, that hee cannot
receiue thy instruction. He
is yet grounded on Christ,
hee is yet a liuing member
of Christ, he is still a souldier
for Christ; therefore still
ioyne with him, and comfort
him in the battels of
the Lord. Take heed thou
quench not that which

smoketh, nor beate downe
the weake hands, which
should be lifted vp against
Satan, and that thou diminish
not one of Christs
Band. But assemble rather,
incourage, and vnite the army
of God, perswading
them to grow strong by
growing on; that so being
mutually strengthened by
vnion, we may be more victorious
in our fighting for
God; and ouercomming,
may be admitted to eate of
the Manna which is hid,
and to reigne with Christ
for euermore. Let vs bee
glad of company in this
our pilgrimage to heauen,
and farre bee it from vs to
lessen it by diuision. But let
vs reioyce when any saith,

though in some infirmitie,
Let vs goe vp to the house
of the Lord, to the Citie of
the liuing God.
         
         
            17
            God is one and immutable,
so may we as certainely
know what he will be hereafter,
as what he hath been
alreadie. Heretofore if men
feared him, they might bee
without all other feare, for
he was their Father, Defender
and Maintainer. This
hauing been tride, we say it
is certaine, and with as
much certaintie may wee
pronounce of the time to
come, that if we feare him,
he will also to vs be a mercifull
God. Let vs not therfore
doubt any change in
him, but in our selues; and

striuing by all holy contention,
praier, fasting aud watching,
to keepe our selues
stedfast toward him, let vs
assure our selues, that hee is
the Rocke immoueable,
whom we shall euer find in
one and the same place.
         
         
            18
            If God commands vs to
doe a thing, and all worldly
profits and pleasures
mustering themselues together,
like the kingdomes of
the world before Christ,
perswade the contrary, wee
must then winke with the
eie of flesh, and so not see, or
at least, not regard any of
them. But then looking
wide open with the eye of
faith, let vs stedfastly behold
God and his glory, remembring

our dutie to him, our
couenant with him, our
happinesse in him. If thus
we can guide the eie of our
soule, that it looke on the
things eternall which are
not seene, and not vpon the
things temporall, which
may be seene, we shall be allured
forward toward that
Kingdome of rest, where
our hope is fixed, and wee
shal passe along as pilgrims,
through this world of lusts,
vnhurt and vnhindred by
them.
         
         
            19
            Christ as he tooke flesh
of the Virgin, so was he the
sonne of Adam, which hee
was, to bee subiect to the
Law laid on Adam; that by
subiection to it, hee might

fulfill and satisfie it. But
Christ as he was begotten
of God, and one with the
second person, so was he an
Adam himselfe, euen a father
of mankinde, by a new
kinde of generation; and
the first Adam from whom
Christ came, must by Christ
be begotten if he will liue
in the new world, euen the
new heauens, and the new
earth. Thus wee see two
rootes of generation, one
carnall another spirituall,
one ingendring to bondage
and death, another to
life and happinesse. Wee
must pray to the great Husbandman,
that hee will cut
vs off from the first roote,
and ingraffe vs into the second;
for he that commeth

after, is preferred before, for
he was before. Then are we
translated from death to
life, then are we Citizens of
the new Ierusalem, wee are
passed from the old things
which must be blotted out,
and are come into the new
world, which abideth for euer.
Where bee now these
pedegrees from Adam, and
the sonnes of Adam with
their swelling glory? They
often come forth to amate
Gods children of low degree,
yet are these the pedegrees
of death, they prooue
their owners to be the glorious
sonnes of sinne and
mortalitie. But, O the infinite
happinesse, and priuiledge
of the sons of God,
borne of the best Father, in

the best image, to the best
inheritance! God their Father
begets them to his
owne image, and becomes
their inheritance, in whom
is the fulnesse of glory, beyond
whome is nothing,
and therfore nothing to be
sought beyond him. Let vs
in comparison of this new
birth and life, despise the
glory of earthly birth, and
earthly life, not as if we had
neither eminence of birth,
nor pleasures of life, (which
perchance was a reason to
Philosophers, but must not
be to Christians and to many
it needs not) but because
they are grosse, miserable,
and base in respect of the
other. For this cause let vs
especially dote on our heauenly

pedegree, and celestiall
happinesse, growing still
stronger in loue with heauen,
as we grow nearer vnto
it. Let vs refuse to be called
the sonnes of Pharaohs
daughter, in respect of being
the sonnes of Pharaohs
Creator. And though this
descent and inheritance be
inuisible, yet therefore are
they the better; for that
which may be seene, shall
vanish away, but that which
may not bee seene endures
for euer; that which may be
seene, is grosse, but that
which may not be seene is
pure and glorious, and only
discernable by a glorified
sight.
         
         
            20
            Gods time and our time

are often different; but
surely he that is wisest, appointeth
the fittest times.
Accordingly, God who is
wisedome, giueth both
meate and all things in due
season. Let vs therfore with
patience surrēder our selues
vp to him in all our necessities,
suffering willingly his
time, to be ours. For he will
come though he seeme to
tarry, and that in the fittest
time, (Luk. 18.) his comming
being quicke enough
in his iudgement, when
sometimes it seemes slow
to ours.
         
         
            21
            The children of Anak
and Achitophel, out of the
acknowledgement of their
owne strength, and cunning,

thinke that if God
would haue any seruants,
he would chuse such able
men as themselues, and not
the meaner sort whome
they despise with the Pharisies,
saying; Doth any of the
Pharisies beleeue in him,
but this base people which
is accursed? Againe, they
are perswaded, that if God
would not finde out them,
they could finde out God,
sooner then the simple
swaine, that beleeues, as
they thinke, only out of a
low spirited feare. But let
them know, that the more
earthen the vessell is, the
more is the glory of him,
that doth great workes in
it. For the basenesse of the
vessell puts away all the

glory from it selfe, vnto
God. Therefore according
to Gods speech of Gideons
armie; They are too many
for me, to ouercome Midian
by them, wee may say
of these iolly men: They
are too good for God to
worke his glory by them:
yet humility acknowledging
all sufficiency to bee
from God, and to bee nothing
without him, might
take them downe, and so
make them fit for God. But
as for the finding of God in
Christ without his owne
light, surely they may as
well finde the Sunne in the
night, and the secrets of the
spirit of man, when the
man himselfe is silent. God
must shine, if hee will bee

seene; he must both tell his
secrets, and giue an vnderstanding
to conceiue them,
if man shall receiue them.
As no man can see God &
liue, so no naturall man can
see Christ who is God, as
long as he liues a meere naturall
man. He must dy; and
especially to his owne wisedome;
and his very sight,
which hee magnifies, for
clearnes, must be acknowledged
for blindnesse, and
be brought to be cured by
the lightsome Spirit of
Christ, which then will
shew him from whome it
selfe proceeded.
         
         
            22
            We are gods, and not our
owne; so are our children,
by creation, if not by sealing.

Why should we doubt
that God will not prouide
for his owne, and in this
doubt seeke to piece out
his prouidence, with a distrustfull
prouidence of our
owne, which indeed at the
best, is but a shrid of his.
Surely our selues and our
children, being more his
then ours, and his loue to
his owne, being purer, and
wiser then ours, we might
rest well contented with
that portion which is granted
by him, to our lawfull
endeauours. For the heauenly
Father, giueth good,
yea the best gifts though
the earthly fathers would
faine sometimes giue greater
ones. But the greatnesse
which the earthly desire, is

earthly, but the good
(which also is great) that
the heauenly giues, is heauēly;
And this God knows
to be a substantiall blessing,
for it is blessednesse it selfe,
stretching beyond time,
& reaching in place aboue
moth and rust. Be we then
thankesgiuers, & not murmurers,
when wee or our
children, haue store of
grace, though with little
wealth; for we are then very
rich in the true treasure,
though not in the vanishing;
and our Father hath
prouided for vs many cities,
and a large inheritance
(Luk. 19. 17.) in the land of
the liuing.
         
         
            23
            The Scripture hath authority,

& selfe-vpholding
in it selfe, because it is the
word of God; and this it
hath, and is, whether men
receiue it or not. Truth is
as much truth whē it is not
acknowledged, as when it
is. But the true manner of
receiuing it is this. At first
the Church inlightned by
Gods Spirit, saw & beheld
in it the truth of God, receiued
it, and commended it
to all to be beleeued. Now
the learners of Christianity,
receiue it first on this
commendation of the
Church, before by it they
receiue the Spirit to discerne
it; As children beleeue
rules giuen by their
Masters vpon trust, before
that by the rules, they come

to the knowledge that they
are right rules. But after hauing
beene inlightned by
the Spirit, they receiue it
then, vpō their own knowledge,
as the first Church
did. And thus proceeding
they come at last to iudge
the Church it selfe, by that
word, which before they
receiued from the Church.
So while I am a naturall
man, I receiue the word of
men; but when I become a
spirituall man, which discerneth
all things, I then discerne
it to be the word by
the Spirit. And the beleefe
which comes from this spirituall
discerning, is truly
and onely faith, the former
is only credence and trust;
the one hath the very

word for the obiect thereof,
the other, the persons of
men. Now miserable is the
estate of that Church that
hedgeth in men within that
trust, and neuer doth suffer
them, or at least incourage
them to proceede to faith.
Where it is taught that it is
sufficient to beleeue the
Church, there mans minde
is perswaded to rest in that
beleefe, and careth not to
beleeue the word for it
selfe. Such a perswasion
fastneth the eye on men,
and turneth it from the
word of light which giueth
light to the simple, and
might, and would be seene
it selfe. Indeede it is an excellent
couer for a bad Religion,
for it keepes men

within the pale of securitie
since they must aske their
teachers only whether their
teachers bee deceiued. By
the same rule may the Alcoran
also be established, or
any the most pestilent Herisie,
if men must bee bounded
by their teachers, and
not looke beyond their
teaching. But farre more
blessed are they, if they be
also blessed with thankfulnesse,
who may looke Diuine
truth in the face, and
loue it for the beauty
which themselues behold
in it. And as men haue happinesse
hereby, so hath God
his glory, who scorneth that
his word should haue men
to giue their word for it. It
is a word that standeth by

it selfe, it approoueth it selfe.
And lest men should say,
that the former trust helpes
the weakenesse of men, and
not of the word; they shold
know, that God hath taken
course himselfe, that man
should not still continue in
such a weaknesse, that still
might neede such helpe.
For as he giues the word to
shine from without, so hee
giues his Spirit to shine
within, that the light of the
Spirit might apprehend the
light of the word. Let vs
not therefore forsake this
inuincible rocke of Christian
religion, euen a self-approuing,
and selfe-establishing
authority of the word.
For as hreby it is strong in it
own strength, & so beareth

it selfe vnmoueable, against
all exception, so herein it
excelleth all errors and heresies,
since none of them
can stand in their own power.
Bee this then the priuiledge
of the word, neuer to
be lost.
         
         
            24
            There are in man naturally,
three knowledges of
good and euill: one of reason,
which is true, as farre as
reason guides it. Another
of instinct, imprinted into
the nature of man at his
creation; such a knowledge
thinks it good to loue our
children, to relieue the distressed,
and thinks the contrarie
euill. Hereto is ioyned
that naturall affection,
which Paul commends,

Rom. 1. but in this sometimes
is excesse, sometimes
defect; and therfore it must
be aduanced or lessened, as
the measure of reason requires.
A third is of lust,
and somtimes called by vs
humour, which esteemes
things good or euill, out of
some blind affection, not
for any reason or iust cause.
So some loue killing, and
hate mercy, some loue
trouble, and hate quietnes,
some loue nothing but
wealth, some vtterly neglect
it, some thinke fame
to be good, and honestie
foolishnesse. This came
with the fall, and hereof we
must take heed in all our
actions: for this is that darknesse,
which brings foorth

the workes of darknes, and
leades to eternall darknes.
         
         
            25
            The things of the next
world, are as certaine as
these heere: for the same
word that said, Let these be,
and they were; saith also,
There are such incomprehensible
things prepared
for them that loue God.
They are as certainely
known by faith, as these by
sight; as truly, though not
so largely. For Moses saw
them certainely; else perchance
for them would he
not haue forsaken the certaine
pleasures of sin. And
the Word saith, that his
faith truly saw God; and no
one true thing, is more true,
then another. Againe, the

things inuisible, are certainly
better then the visible:
for holy men haue euer despised
the present for those
to come. The hart can conceiue
temporall things, but
not eternal; and that which
is of God, is infinitely inferior
to God himselfe. But
what is the reason then that
we chuse them not, being
certainly knowne, and farre
better? The reason is, because
our station is natural,
elementarie and grosse, and
likenesse makes loue onely
to like. Therefore also the
things aboue being supernatural
and pure, must haue
a minde of like temper to
loue them. There must be
a new station, a second
worke, euen stinting and

crossing nature. Yea, wee
must haue a minde lifted aboue
nature, to loue things
aboue nature, wee must bee
raised aboue flesh into an
heauenly knowledge, to see
heauenly truth, not sinking
with beasts into the low region
of seeing, touching,
and tasting. Thus lifted vp
and made spirituall, we shal
discerne and approue spirituall
things, as the naturall
man doth the obiects of nature.
Therefore let vs importune
God, the Father of
this better nature, that hee
will distill into vs some
drops of that heauēly dew,
which may giue vs heauenly
mindes, and make vs to
loue the things of heauen,
as much as flesh and blood

doth things of earth. Surely
vntill then, the wise Naturalist,
thinks happinesse folly;
and then the spirituall
man demonstrably seeth
and prooueth all present
things to bee vaine vanitie.
Vntil then we are but great
children, or brute beasts
concluded vnder the senses;
and we then onely are
men, whē we get the image
of God our Father, which
both knowes him, and is
knowne of him. Such were
they whom God made at
first, & such are they whom
God now makes againe.
         
         
            26
            If euery thing bee desirable
according to the benefit
thereof, then either prosperitie
or aduersity may be

loued, and neither determinately
hated or cōdemned.
For either is very profitable
to a man, and most commonly,
aduersitie. Let vs
therefore cease to despise it
in others, or impatiently to
beare it in our selues, since
aduersitie hath whipt many
to heauen, when prosperity
hath coached more to hell.
Let vs leaue off, with children
onely to desire pleasant
things, and growne into
men in Christ, let vs desire
wholesome things. It is
better in good sadnesse to
be saued, then in good fellowship
to be damned.
         
         
            27
            The Church truely and
rightly calleth God her saluation.
By God is not one

person only meant, but the
whole three persons. For
God the Father, through
his Son, by the holy Ghost,
saueth vs. God the Father,
principally out of a fundamentall
loue elected vs, appointed
& gaue the means,
by which this election
might produce saluation.
God the Sonne principally
did put himselfe into
the very work of our saluation,
and became the maine
matter, meanes and treasurie
thereof. God the holy
Ghost principally distributeth
and imparteth by particular
gift and application,
the saluation, which was
fore-ordained by the Father,
and is treasured vp in
the Sonne. So the whole

Trinitie ioyneth together
in this our happinesse, it being
absolutely necessarie
toward our saluation, that
there should be an election
and appointment of the
meanes, an actuall exhibition
of the meanes appointed,
and an actuall application
of the meanes exhibited.
Therefore when wee
say, we are saued by Christ,
we meane not, that wee are
saued by the second person
onely, and the humane nature
vnited to him: but with
Saint Paul we meane, that
whole God was in Christ,
and reconciled the world to
himselfe. Accordingly in
our due thanksgiuings, whē
we praise God for his gifts
toward the new life, we ascribe

glory to him for our
Election, for our Iustification,
for our Regeneration,
which are the maine works
of our saluation, and are the
ioynt-workes of the vndiuided
Trinitie. But yet we
can follow this truth no
farder, then it goes before
vs. Therfore when we come
to regeneration, there must
we stop and looke no further
for saluation, for therein
is our saluation accomplished,
and all the parts
thereof perfected. If after
we will goe on to workes as
to further causes of our saluation,
we goe beyond the
truth, being past the God-head,
and come vnto man.
For though it may be said,
that God worketh these

workes in man, yet man
ioyneth therein with God.
Now the saluation of man
is deriued into man from
God alone, and is then absolute
and full in parts, whē
Election, Iustification, and
Regeneration, the absolute
and only workes of the
Trinity, haue wrought vpon
him. For regeneration
hauing put into man, the
seede of God which is the
seede of life; Man is then
translated from death to
life; and hauing begotten
him the Sonne of God, hee
is then the heire of promised
glory and eternitie. Indeed
works comming after
the state and right of life
and glorie, their goodnesse,
as it comes from God, so it

shall be rewarded by God,
increasing the degrees of
that glory, wherein before
we had an vndeniable property,
and title. Therefore
works adde not a new part
of saluation but only increase
the issues, and fruit
of a part formerly possessed.
Accordingly doth the
Diuine song of that rauished
soule, orderly declare
Gods sauing of vs from our
enemies to goe before our
seruing of God, in holinesse
all the daies of our life: So
workes themselues are placed,
as fruits of our saluation,
and therefore the glory
giuen to workes, is but as
the fruite of the fruite of
saluation. But why then
shall it be said; Come yee

blessed, for ye fed mee; and
blessed are they that keepe
the commandements, that
their right may bee in the
tree of Life; So that good
works seeme to iustifie and
saue in the day of iudgement.
Herein comparisons
may inlighten, though not
prooue. If a man haue a
wife of a suspected life,
whose many children when
the dying husband calleth
before him, hee saith to
those that liuely represent
him; Come to mee the true
sonnes of Mee your Father,
you truely resemble mee,
therefore to you shall bee
giuen the inheritance of
your Father. Here for their
countenance and proportion
is the inheritance adiudged

to them, yet is it not
for that indeed giuen them,
but because thereby they
are iudged to be sonnes, for
which Son-ship, the inheritance
is verily giuen them.
So doth God in his great
iudgement, he will iudge
men to bee his sonnes by
their good workes, it being
impossible that good works
can come from any cause
but Regeneration, and for
the regenerate sonnes, was
the kingdome of glorie
long agone prepared euen
by that election which was
before the world. So the
word, For, doth not still imply
the cause it selfe, but
sometimes an inseparable
signe annexed to the cause,
as if it should be said: My

sonnes are heires of my
kingdome, & those which
are my sonnes, and they
only bring forth the works
of loue; these workes haue
I seene in you, therefore do
I acknowledge you to bee
my sonnes, enter into your
Fathers ioy.
         
         
            28
            There are two things
without in the word, which
witnesse it to bee excellent
aboue nature; A supernaturall
truth, and a supernaturall
holinesse; There are also
two supernaturall things
within a Christian, which
ioyne their inward witnessing
to the outward; A supernaturall
inlightning, to
acknowledge, and beleeue
this truth; and a supernaturall

vertue changing the
will into a conformity with
this holinesse. So in the
mouth of many witnesses
standeth firme the truth of
diuine truth.
         
         
            29
            Man and the earth are
growne wilde by the fall of
Adam, both bring foorth
weedes of their owne nature.
But as the earth is cured
by husbandrie & good
seed, so by the regeneration
of Christ the chiefe husbandman,
and the seede of
the word, man is brought
into a fruitfull nature, and
hath a remedy for the first
Adam by the last. Blessed
be the word which is God,
and reuerenced and desired
be the word of that Word

which is of God, for of them
is our life and health.
         
         
            30
            As a man in his first conuersion
yeelded himselfe
into a generall submission
vnto the spirit, so must hee
doe in euery particular action;
and then most resolutely
when sin tempteth most
strongly our selues. Wee
made our couenant at first
for the whole, and continually
we must performe the
parts of the promised
whole. When we gaue our
selues to the spirit, of dead
branches to be made liuely
branches, withall inclusiuely,
we gaue our selues to
bring forth the continuall
fruite of liuing branches;
which is done by a continuall

sucking of life from
the spirit which quickneth
vs. Now if we rest contented
onely with our first ingrafting,
though the Almightinesse
of him whose
seed is immortall, and who
wil not faile of his end, may
preserue vs aliue, yet do we
what wee may to kill our
selues, and to falsifie our couenant
with him: who
therefore beeing offended
will chastise vs with temporall
iudgements, and desertions,
and will shew that
when hee is angry he is a
consuming fire. But let the
true sonnes keepe neere to
their father, let them keepe
close to his spirit, moouing
at euery motion of it, and
filling the wants in their

Lampes with the continuall
oyle thereof; for this spirit
is our very life and the
witnesse thereof; By our generall
resignation this life
entred, and by particular resignation
this life increaseth;
so the more we sow to
this spirit, the more we shal
reape of life eternal. Again,
as a mā in his great & main
conuersion from a sinner &
guilty, to a sanctified and iustified
man, goeth ouer himself
in general with yt iudgement
of the Law, whereby
finding himselfe a man of
death, he flieth vnto Christ,
who baptizeth him from
his guilt, and sinfulnesse by
his Bloud and Spirit; giuing
both his actuall righteousnes;
and the spirits habitual

righteousnesse; so after the
committing of euery particular
sin, we shold go ouer it
with a particular iudgment
of ye Law, wherby acknowledging
it to be a worke of
death, wee should flie to a
particular applicatiō of the
great Baptisme: that so putting
away the particular
guilt of that sinne by the
washing of Christs blood,
and the particular vncleannesse
of that sinne by the
washing of Christs Spirit,
we which before were generally
clensed and iustified,
may also haue a particular
and continual clensing and
iustification. For our inward
and outward Baptisme
though at once performed,
is of continual vse,

and daily wee must haue a
recourse thereto (to wit by
the outward remembring
and passing to the inward)
that the stocke of iustification,
and sanctification at
first imparted may be daily
applied, and distributed to
our particular necessities.
And thogh being in Christ
we haue in him iustification
and sanctification, yet God
expecteth wee shall not let
either of them shift for it
selfe, and to worke on vs,
not working therwith. But
hee looketh that daily sinning
against him, we should
daily offer vp to him the iustificatiō
of Christ to purge
away the guilt of sinne; and
daily request of him the
Spirit of sanctification, and

the increase thereof to
purge away the defiling of
sin. Thus doing we keepe
our selues in cōtinuall purenesse,
and to be pure wee
must do thus; And because
the latter is most painfull
but absolutely necessary, we
must giue great heede therto.
For all sinne leauing on
vs guilt, and a staine, the
guilt is not ordinarily forgiuen
except the staine bee
taken away; therefore as oft
as we would be forgiuen of
the guilt by Christs bloud,
let vs aske Christs Spirit to
wash away the spot contracted
by sinne. When Dauid
will hopefully pray to bee
deliuered from bloud-guiltinesse,
hee must pray also,
Create in me a cleane hart,

and renew a right spirit in
me. Thus must the sonnes
and daughters of God put
away euery vncleannesse
from among them, beeing
perfect in their purposes
and endeauours, as their
heauenly Father is perfect.
And when they intreate
this Spirit to clense the blemish
of their soule, they
must doe it with a submission
to the spirit, to be wholly
guided & changed therby,
and particularly to haue
that very sin slaine, which
before defiled them; that
the spirit may be as it were
reuenged on the sin which
grieued it, and that it may
be restored to the true place
and power thereof, euen of
raigning & dominion ouer

vs and our sinfull lusts;
from which it was degraded
by that rebellious sinner,
which therefore must
now bee subiected and cast
downe vnder it.
         
         
            31
            Death in respect of this
life seemeth to bee a great
euill, because it is an end of
life, and of all the pleasures
thereof. But the same death
is rather a most excellent
benefit which putteth vs
out of this life subiect to euill,
and whose natural happinesse
is in the creature, into
an eternall life beyond
the reach of euill, whose
happinesse is the enioying
of the infinite fulnes of the
Creator, in whom the goodnesse
of the creature is also

included. Therefore death
is a gate, whose neare side,
though it seeme couered
with blacknesse, yet the inner
side is couered with
shining gold, and the purest
light hath her dwelling
there. Let vs therefore with
the holy men of God by
faith, looke to the farther
side of this partition, let vs
pierce beyond darknes vnto
light, beyond the shade
vnto glorie, not sticking altogether
with the blind
multitude on the darknes,
which is on this side, as
bounded therewith. Then
with Paul shall we crie to be
dissolued to be with Christ,
wee shall so admire the inside,
that wee shall despise
the outside; wee shall with

the holy Martyrs & Saints
push at this gate, saying, Open
the euerlasting doores,
that wee may enter in vnto
the King of glorie. Besides,
if wee will looke from our
selues to other creatures,
wormes, birds and cattell
die for the profit of men,
yea for their pleasure; yet
man created them not, neither
can claime any right
to this power of their liues,
but by gift. But God by creation
hath a right to man,
and for his glorie hath appointed
man to die, which
oweth infinitely more to
God, then the creatures to
man: yet man is loth to do
that for God, which without
feeling he will haue the
beasts doe for him. But, O

man, yeeld to thy Maker,
be thou for him, who hath
made the beasts for thee,
and therefore himselfe.
Breake not this appointed
order: thou hast this addition
of comfort, thou goest
to happinesse when thou
diest, and so God doth not
kill thee, but call for thee.
He takes thee not from being,
but alters thy being,
and makes it better; follow
him gladly therfore, remouing
thee to blisse: and the
Law which thou willingly
allowest on the creature to
his extinguishment, allow
also vpon thy selfe for thy
aduantage. But if thou wilt
not yet away, thou must,
thou maist lose the benefit
which might be made of

it, but escape thou canst
not; the decree of heauen
must stand in despight of
thee; and to conforme our
selues to it, is our chiefe wisdome
and ease.
         
         
            32
            Many things are troublesome
and full of worke;
one thing is easie, readie
and mannageable. Many
things can tend no farther
then this world, which tendeth
but to vanitie and corruption;
one thing tendeth
to eternitie, and to happinesse
in eternitie. Againe,
these many things leading
to vanity, hinder much that
one thing which leadeth to
eternall felicitie. Let men
therefore chuse that one
which is easie, and rewardeth

with happines, rather
then the many which comber
vs, only for vanitie.
But especially let them beware,
that with those many
things of vanitie they comber
and hinder not that one
thing of felicitie. Let them
beware, that with temporal
trouble, they purchase not
trouble eternall; and so take
paines neuer to bee out of
trouble. Many there are,
who haue a smoking flaxe
of religion in them, and ambition
or couetousnesse allureth
them to put into
their harts, the many things
which are combersome,
thinking still to retaine
roome for that one thing
which is necessarie. But by
little and little the many

things so possesse the heart,
that the one thing is thronged
out, and the smoke
which might haue been a
fire, is no longer a smoke.
Thus doe they kill the spirituall
life which began in
them, and with many cares
buy death eternall. But pittie
your selues, O ye sons of
Adam; know your strength,
and take heed you sell not
your soules for the whole
world. Some indeed haue a
greater force and dispatch
to turne ouer many worldly
businesses, but take heed
thou ouerlay it not. Some
are weake, and a little ouerthroweth
them. Let not
a horse vndertake the burthen
of a Camell, and let
neither goe beyond his

strength: the surest way is,
to bee faultie (if on any
side) on the best, and surest
side; therefore bee sure
thou allow enough to that
one thing which is necessarie,
though thou abridge
and lessen those many
things, which are troublesome
and transitorie. But if
thou fillest and ladest thy
selfe with care, thou becommest
indeed a Camell, euen
a beast of burden, thou canst
not goe through the eye of
the needle, thou hast too
much about thee, to goe in
at the straight gate of the
Kingdome of heauen.
         
         
            33
            Mankind hath rooted in
it a facultie, or rather an impotencie
of desiring, which

cleaueth fast to him through
his whole life. Whatsoeuer
outward changes befall, or
whatsoeuer prosperity without
change, there is a roote
of lust and desire in man,
which still will bud foorth;
and if it fasten on nothing
to be desired, it is in paine,
and desireth earnestly to
desire something. The reason
of this, is the saying of
Christ, That which is born
of flesh is flesh: to wit, that
which is borne of fleshly
lust, is lustfull flesh, the effect
is like the cause. Hence
are those endlesse desires,
which are euer reaching,
though without need, with
out vse. Hence it is, that the
man who is ignorant of his
owne nature, so often deceiueth

himselfe, while as
often hee telleth himselfe,
that such a thing had, hee
will leaue desiring. For euen
after that had, hee desires
afresh, and on that verie
thing ofttimes whereby
hee thought to bound the
old, he raiseth a new desire:
the whiles hee perceiueth
not, that himselfe is still the
cause of his desires, and not
the obiects; so that whiles
he is himselfe, hee shall still
desire: Indeed when a thing
desired is enioyed, the desire
seemeth to cease, and
then man thinkes hee will
desire no more. But that is
but one single desire, which
ceaseth by the obtaining of
that his obiect, the power
of desiring still remaineth

vnslaine, and is no more taken
away, then a roote by
the breaking of a single
branch; therefore it still
newly buddeth out, and
makes endlesse worke, vpon
the ende of one desire,
sending foorth a new. But
what remedie is there to
this euill? Surely we must
not run so much to obiects
thereby to satisfie and quiet
desires, which is endlesse;
as to our selues, to kill them
all in the roote. But this euill
cleaueth so fast to man,
that except man can be vntwined
frō himself (which
is also very hard) it seemes
impossible to bee cleared.
And this very thing that
is impossible to man, is
possible to God, and done

by God. He by regeneration
putteth a new man
into vs, which eateth
out the old man corrupt
through these deceiueable
lusts. This new man
teacheth and mooueth vs
to denie the lusts which
fight against the soule. It
changeth vs and our nature,
and makes vs dead vnto
lusts, and aliue vnto
truth and reason. Therfore
if wee will bee at rest in our
selues, and keepe a perpetuall
Sabbath in our soules,
let vs pray for this godly
nature vnto God the father
of it, which may free vs
from this slauerie of lust,
(that like the Egiptian bondage
still sends vs about to
seeke worke for our selues)

and may put into vs holy,
reasonable, and measured
desires. Let vs giue our
selues wholly to be led by
the light and motion therof,
taking no care to fulfill
the vnlimited lusts of the
flesh; And surely this world
of vanitie is not worth a
long or large desire, neither
is the lustfull desire of any
thing, more then a sickenesse
& labor of the mind,
and no helpe to the thing
desired.
         
         
            34
            As a man Regenerate
hath two natures in him, so
haue tēporall euils which
fall on him, two natures
and effects instilled into
them from the former two.
For first by the old man

they haue a taste wholly
bitter put vpon them; they
are to it proposed and beheld
as punishments, euen
the strokes of God hating
and afflicting. This made
many holy men cry out in
their agonies that God hated
them, that hee did set
them as Markes, that they
were borne vnto sorrow
and darkenes. But the godly
nature which wee haue
from Christ, touching these
afflictions when they touch
vs, turnes them as the waters
of Marah into wholesome
sustenance, yea into
medicines; For Christ is actiue
euen vpon his passions,
both in himselfe and
his members. And as all
such troubles are sanctified

by the touch thereof, so
doth the same nature inwardly
teach vs that these
chastisemēts are the strokes
of a louing Father: & withall
it so comforteth and asswageth
our soules with the
oyles therof, that we reioice
amid tribulatiōs: & among
the complaints of the old
man, there often breake
forth pangs of ioy sent
from this holy and blessed
nature, as wee finde in the
writings of the Prophets.
Let vs therefore in our sufferings
not so much looke
to the outward shew of
temporall euils, but goe inwardly
into that temple of
ours where the holy Spirit
dwelleth, and there let vs
aske aduice of it, & inquire

what they are; This Spirit
will answer vs with comfort,
that they are blessings,
that they are blessed to vs,
that they cure vs, beeing
heauenly exercises imposed
to suppresse our corruption,
to keepe our new man
actiue and able, & to make
him bring forth the fruite
of patience, and righteousnesse.
And if we hearken
with beleefe and rest to the
spirit thus informing vs, we
shall see the promised effects,
euen increase of sanctification
and glorification.
         
         
            35
            Most rightly doth the
wisedome & grace of God
informe vs against lust,
which is the maine roote

of sinne, a mistresse of folly,
& an inuenter of torments.
It is still begetting of sinne,
for still it setteth vs either against
God, or holdeth vs
from him, by committing
euill, and omitting good; it
wrappeth vs in continuall
folly, for it selfe is blindnes
and possessing the vnderstanding
neither seeth it
self, neither suffers it to see.
Accordingly it imployes
man in many endlesse, vnprofitable
yea impossible
proiects, which condemne
the man that laboureth in
them of a darke and deceiued
iudgement, and withall
punisheth him for it; It
filleth our life with torments,
for whereas enioying,
is the comfort & chiefe

portion out of this life, lusts
neuer suffer men to enioy,
or at least not long, but sets
him still on new worke, and
spurres him vnto new trauailes.
It tells the minde
that which thou hast is nothing,
except thou haue
some other addition & increase:
that which thou art
is nothing, except thou
some way increase it thy
selfe. So is the soule still driuen
from her rest, & made
a Lackey to trudge on the
businesses of lust; Amidst
which trauailes she meetes
with many crosses, feares,
griefes, which like theeues
and wilde beasts stand readie
for them which go that
dangerous way; how much
better were it for the soule

to cut it selfe off by diuine
circumcision from this accursed
lust, and to ioyne it
selfe to grace, the contrarie
and remedie thereof? For
grace will draw vs nearer to
God our happinesse, it will
make vs to rest in God, and
by conforming vs to him
will both please him and
blesse vs: it will be a light to
our soules, euen a day-starre
in our hearts, shewing vs
waies right profitable and
possible; it will ease vs from
many harsh and laborious
seruices, teaching vs to beleeue,
that it is farre better
to walke in the sight of the
eye, then in the lusts of the
flesh.
         
         
            36
            There are many considerations

which would allay
the swelling of Ambition,
if they were as duely applyed
to it by reason as glorious
obiects are to it by
corrupted nature. Now
since with naturall men, naturall
thoughts fit best, let
vs talke with them in their
owne language. It is a confessed
thing by all that vnderstand
this life, that enioying
is the height & vtmost
of life, and the more
solide and hearty inioying,
the higher is that height.
This being chiefest, to that
should the minde chiefely
aspire; for if it goe to that
which seemes higher, but
is not, it sells substance for
shadow, and being, for seeming.
Now if we inquire in

what estate this enioying is
greatest, we shall finde in
that wherein naturall, and
as we terme them, kindly
affections, and desires, haue
most satisfaction. For indeede
what comparison is
their betweene the imagination
of being pointed at
for greatnesse, and the solide
sweetnesse of being loued
of a wise and honest
friend? What comparison
betweene the officious and
hartles complements of seruice-offring-flatterers,
and
the obsequious loue of a
chaste wife, and dutifull
children? what equality betweene
the delicate inuitations
of a dainty feast vnto
a cloyed stomacke, and the
sweetnes of plaine fare to a

naturall appetite, which desireth
it not▪ beeing desired
of it. If these be the better
comforts of life, and that
life is better which hath
most of them, then in a
meane degree and not still
in the greater is the best
portion of life. Therefore
it is not amisse for men
sometimes to aspire downwards
euen to the conditions
of an estate beneath
them selues. This I set forth
not as perswading an vniuersall
priuatenesse (which
as mans ouer-spreading
ambition will euer make
impossible, so it needeth
not) but only in a publike
fortune to carry a priuate
minde not swilling in too
generall and large desires,

but bounded within naturall,
and becomming affections.
And this, not to
make a heauen of it on
earth, as the Philosopher
in vaine assayed, in a world
so throughly tempered and
seasoned with misery; but
to draw men vpon profitable
and aduantageable
termes into the most quiet
and orderly compasse of
life; that the order and quietnesse
thereof might allow
roome for the practise of
some course profitable to
the Commonwealth, and
especially to the contemplation
of a better life. For
these are too much put out
of minde by swolne Ambition;
that oft so takes vp
the whole heart, that it

thrusts this present life, the
countrey wherein life was
receiued, and that country
where only true life and
happinesse shall bee, beyond
all care and remembrance.
         
         
            37
            The pleasures of this
world after they are past,
(and after they begin they
are going to be past) are as
much nothing as if they
had not beene. Therefore
whē sinfull pleasures tempt
vs, let vs thinke, that if we
by Religion put them not
from being, they will euen
by beeing put themselues
from being. Wherefore let
vs much rather choose, that
grace should make them to
bee nothing, and to performe

an acceptable worke
to God, which shal haue his
reward, then giue them
leaue by their owne nature
to bring themselues to the
same nothing, and yet to
leaue guilt behind, and obligation
to punishment. But
if the mind will needs dote
on dying pleasantnesse, let
the same mind at that same
time know and beleeue the
pleasure of seeing Gods
face, infinitely to exceede
this both in quantitie and
in qualitie, and that it shall
as certainely appeare to vs
hereafter, as these doe now,
if wee refuse these for it.
There is no ods that may
disswade vs, but presentnes
of the one, and futurenesse
of the other; which being

againe vnmeasurablely ouerwaied
by aduantage of
excellencie and eternitie,
should so mainely carry vs,
that we should despise the
presentnesse of all sinfull
pleasures, much more then
Iacob his next present seuen
yeeres libertie for Rachel; or
one that proueth masteries
his present ease and pleasure
for a corruptible crowne.
         
         
            38
            The affections of man
are vsefull and commendable,
meeting with fit occasions,
and limited by due
measure. But they are commonly
inordinate among
vs, and lay hold on wrong
obiects, or on true in wrong
measure. Ioy is good, yea
necessarie, when Gods loue

is beheld and considered.
And ioy is good, when
Gods blessings are powred
vpon vs, for euen that ioy is
the gift of God: but ioy
oft transgresseth; for it reioyceth
more in the blessings,
then in God; and it is
too liuely in temporall
things, and too dull in eternall.
Yea, it reioyceth somtimes
in sinne, our owne or
others, which is a ioy in the
place of sorrow. For sorrow,
though hated, is also very
profitable, and excellently
meete for the sinfull and
miserable estate of man.
Sinne, when it hath myred
the soule, by repentant
sorrow hath the filth,
(though not guilt) washed
away, and indeed the guilt

is not washed away by
Christ, vntill the filth bee
washed away by spirituall
sorrow. For as long as the
dregges of sinne lie on the
soule vnbathed in repentance:
so long the blood of
Christ, as it were, lotheth to
come neere it. Againe, sorrow
fitteth excellently the,
estate of vanity and misery,
that our looke being sad,
our heart may be made better;
and that griefe may
stirre vs vp to apply our
hearts to wisedome, whereby
wee may escape through
vanitie and misery, into immortalitie
and happinesse.
But sorrow is often faulty,
when it sorrowes more for
losses, then for sins; which
in effect is more for losses

of this life, then of life eternall.
It is faulty also, when
it is stubborne against spirituall
ioy, and will not let
the hart reioyce in the mercy
of God, though he bid it
reioyce continually; yea
hatred it selfe is good, yet in
one only cause, when it is against
men that hate God;
for then may we hate both
their wickednes, and them
as our vtter enemies. Yet
wee must beware wee hate
not men for some single
sinne, who otherwise striue
to liue vprightly; for in many
things we offend al, and
haue need our selues in such
cases often to be spared. To
such belongs the Spirit of
meekenes to restore them;
and if Dauid say, I haue sinned

against God, the Prophet
must say, Thy sinne is
also forgiuen thee. But the
habitual and greedy sinner,
that putteth God far from
him, and in defiance saith,
Who is the Lord; this man
is odious, and Iehosaphat
shall be bitterly chidden if
he loue them; yet the bond
of charitie may still hold
on, which must watch that
our hatred be for Gods sake
onely, and not our owne
(for man ought not to hate
man in his owne behalfe.)
Beside this, charitie must
pray for the amendment of
him; for charitie to man
desireth the preseruation,
not the destructiō of man,
as farre as it may, without▪
offending the charitie of

God. But summarily to
bring all affections into
their true vse and proportion,
let vs finde out both
their vse and measure in the
word of light, kindling or
quenching them, lengthening
or shortning them, according
to the direction
and line thereof.
         
         
            39
            The best knowledge hath
been anciently thought to
be mans knowledge of himselfe:
but the best knowledge
indeede being the
knowledge of the best,
which is God, the knowledge
of man comes next
in worth, who is the next
best in this lower world,
and whom God knowne,
teacheth and commandeth

to know himselfe, and who
by knowing himselfe shall
the better know God. Now
the immediate vse of this
knowledge being to better
the knower, hee that will
make most vse therof, must
learne to know himselfe
most in those parts and faculties,
which are of most
vse and excellence. Therefore
on the soule, let the
soule of man especially fasten
her eies, that knowing
herself with a right and true
knowledge, she may finde
what is right in her, to continue
and confirme it; and
which is crooked and corrupted,
to auoide & amend
it. But to do this clearely,
she hath need of some light
aboue her owne; for it is

hard for the blind soule to
see her owne blindnesse.
Therefore begging for that
eye-salue of the greatest
Light, and so hauing obtained
it, let her goe on to a
true search and inquirie of
her selfe. In this inquirie,
let her generally compare
the resolutions of her vnderstanding,
and the inclinations
of her will, with the
lawes of her Maker. For seeing
the soule did, and shold
beare the Image of God,
which Image, the lawes of
God truly and vnchangeably
expresse: it is a certaine
truth, that wherin the soule
differeth and boweth from
these lawes, in vnderstanding
or will; therein, and in
so much, the soule differeth

from God, and hath abated
and altered his Image. And
this is indeed a chiefe and
most worthy employment
of mans time on earth,
when the soule lookes into
Gods loue, as into a glasse,
and thereby trimmeth
and fitteth her selfe for her
Maker, against the day of
her appearance before his
glorious Selfe, who cannot
abide to see any thing neere
him that is vnlike him.
Now there are some parcels
and remnants of this
Law, yet remaining of the
first writing in the nature
of man: but if we will reade
profitably therein, we must
take heed we follow it not
too farre, but still compare
it with the Law written, because

there are but small
broken and corrupted pieces
thereof. While we are
in this search, as generalitie
and custome are great binders
of the soule vnto error
and corruption, so a suspicion
that a generall estimation
of things may proceede
from the vnderstanding deceiued,
or the will corrupted,
may be a great helpe to
bring the soule into her
place and true estate. For
to suspect deceit, is a first
and excellent degree toward
being vndeceiued; &
vnto this suspicion of mens
wisest and most esteemed
opinions, the word of truth
giueth vs a good foundation,
while it sayes, that many
things which are highly

esteemed among men, are abominable
in the sight of
God. And of this againe,
there is an vnfallible reason,
euen the corruptnesse
of the soule by the fall of
man. For this deprauation
mightily possessing the vnderstanding,
makes it in the
best iudgement thereof, to
think deceitfully of things,
and withall to thinke these
deceiued thoughts wise, because
it knoweth nothing
beyond them. But let the
soule that prepareth her
selfe for God, vntie her selfe
from her selfe, as from a
thing corrupted, and from
the world, as from a multitude
of such things as her
selfe is; equally blinded,
and walking in the same

darkenesse, though among
themselues they be agreed
to call it light. Thus putting
off her own corruption and
that of the world, shee is fit
and ready to be new stamped
with the image of her
Creator, and to be inlightned
with truth in her vnderstanding,
and to put on
rightnesse in her wil, which
let her learne from the law,
and desire to haue ingrauen
in her by grace. In this
course there will bee many
Rubbs, the glorious folly
of the world will mocke
thy particular and desolate
wisedome, it will disswade
thee from singularity and
desire, or prouoke thee to
erre with company; it will
aske thee whether the rulers

doe beleeue as thou
doest; yea thine owne corruption
will somtime strike
thee into astonishment, and
make thee muse and wonder
whether thou art in a
right minde and purpose.
But goe on vnchanged,
knowing that thou seekest
not what is vsuall, but what
is right, and the patterne to
which thou art fitting thy
selfe is not man but God;
euen a patterne of perfection
beyond all exception.
This is also their duty if
they considered it. Therefore
let them that would
turne thee, returne to thee,
Returne not thou to them.
When thou shalt present
thy selfe before God, the
more holy and vnblameable

thou art, the more acceptable
shalt thou bee to
him, who wil not aske what
company came with thee,
but wil know and acknowledge
his sonnes by their
likenesse to him, and accordingly
reward them as that
is more or lesse; & then shal
it be no sorrow of heart to
thee, that thou hast gone
out of thy selfe, and the
world, to passe through
somewhat more vnsociably
into happinesse.
         
         
            40
            God is the iudge of the
world, and iudgeth it generally
by two kinds of iudgment.
The first is by Deputies,
and so by Kings, Magistrates
and Iudges, he iudgeth
mankinde. It is the

iudgement of God which
is committed to them, and
they are his mouth to the
people▪ How wicked and
false are they then, that out
of the mouth of God giue
not the iudgement of God,
but of their owne corruption!
that seeke not what
God iudgeth of the case,
but what themselues may
iudge, corruptly, if couertly.
These are in the ranke
of the old false Prophets,
which said the Lord saith,
when hee speaketh not by
them. Thou standest ô corrupt
man, in the place of
God, to represent him, but
thou actest this part ill fauouredly,
and insteede of
representing the pure, and
by-bribes-vnflexible Lord

of the world, thou plaiest
the part of a base and rotten-harted
slaue; so doest
thou expresse thy owne
vice not his iustice, and wee
receiue that iudgement of
mony, not of God. Yet is
that indeede thy God, and
tells thee what sentence
thou shalt giue; and all this
is wisedome if concealed
from the eyes of men. But
euen for that point also
know this, that thogh thou
art only in that place deputed
to iudge, yet many others,
particulars beeing
heard, cā & do iudge as wel
as thy selfe: these see & feele
when the bias of couetousnesse,
and corruptions, carrie
thee from the straight
line of iustice; they feele

whē the iudge is some way
allyed to the cause, & hath
some feeling of it, because
hee or his haue felt some
thing for it; yea generally
they talke of it, though out
of hearing; for corruptnesse
though it haue no other
goodnesse, hath yet some
modestie, and is ashamed to
heare it selfe spoken of, for
it knoweth it selfe to bee a
vice: yet this is one more
vice of that vice, to rage
more against others that
reueale it, then against the
owner of it, that did such a
thing which might iustly
shame the Author of it, if
reuealed. Let such a one be
rather angry with himselfe
for doing ill, then with another,
for speaking truth.

But because through this
net of humane iustice and
deputatiue iudgement, many
guilty, if profitable offenders
breake out and escape,
God hath another
greater net which he casts
without these, wherein hee
takes both the escapers, and
the giuers of leaue to escape;
This is the great and
generall iudgement, wherein
God in person will sit as
iudge, and will examine the
iudges themselues and the
iudged. Then the righteous
Iudge of the world,
shall iustifie the iudges that
haue iudged righteously in
this world; But there they,
that now are wrōgfully iustified
shall iustly bee condemned,
and the mooueable

Iudges that missed
their part, and changing
iudgement, spake from thē
               selues,
when they should
haue spoken frō God, shall
haue their faults repeated
vnto them, if vnrepeated;
and by the iust mouth of
God himselfe, shall with
their faults be deliuered to
Satan the iayler, who shall
carry them to the dungeon,
where the worme dyeth
not, nor the fire goeth out.
But because such men doe
fortifie their consciences, against
the terrors of the
Lord, and his fearefully-great
iudgement, and put
the euill day either wholly
or farre from them; that
they bee not vtterly without
feare in this world, God

doth many times by particular
iudgements strike, either
them, their issue, or
those whom they haue iustified
in offences; by which
particular stroakes on some
among many, he puts them
in minde that hee which
now iudgeth some, shall
hereafter iudge all sinne, being
equally odious in all,
and equally lyable to iudgment.
Hee strikes not all,
yet, because generall iustice
is reserued for the generall
iudgement; But he strikes
some, that their iudgement
might to al be an earnest of
a generall iudgement, and
might in the meane time
terrifie men from wickednesse
by present plagues,
who feare not the future.
         
         
            
            41
            Moreouer; it is a great
motiue from sinne, the
shortnesse of the time betweene
sinne and punishment:
there is nothing but
life betweene them; & howsoeuer
we lengthen it in our
imagination to keepe vs
from feare of punishment,
yet if we consider it by the
most earnest and most trusted
iudgement, which is
that of the worldly wise, it is
therby valued but at seauen
yeares or thereabout; yet if
it be (as it is but with some)
a continuance of thirtie or
forty yeares, after thou
commest to thy full age
of wickednesse, aske the
worldling what hee thinketh
of himselfe when hee

hath such a tearme in a liuing.
He will by no meanes
think himself a setled man,
he will not much build vpon
it, for hee holds it but a
short time, and is continually
troubled that it weares
so fast & is so neere an end.
Surely the diuell hath a
great aduantage vpon vs
by this deceit of our flesh,
that it can tell vs truths in
many things when their vse
and end is earthly, but
tels vs falshoods in the same
things when their vse is
heauenly; it makes vs wise
for matters of this generation,
but not for those of the
Regeneration. But let vs,
where there is such a truth
so found, take the line from
the worldly things, and lay

it on the spirituall, then shal
we finde that grosly to appeare,
which before was
not perceiued, and so may
we deceiue the Diuell himselfe,
his aduantage beeing
made ours. Accordingly let
vs take that life, wherewith
the wisedome of the world
doth measure life for worldly
purposes, and lay it on
the same life for our spirituall
vse: then shall we finde
that the sinfull pleasures of
life, are but pleasures for a
season, & that a short one,
and that there is but the
same short season betweene
pleasant sinne and eternall
punishments.
         
         
            42
            He that wil finde a good
friend let him seeke a good

Christian. For a Christian
is more then a man, and
hath the strength of God
added to the strength of
man: Christ the Rocke is
his foundation, and he will
stand the billowes, and beat
backe the tempests, for hee
is founded on a Rocke. But
the Moralist, and the Romane
of these times, are but
flesh and blood, sand and
dust; therefore floods and
tempests wash him, and
blow him away. Wonder
not therfore my soule with
the world, neither take vp
the vsual complaints of the
deceiueable vncertaintie of
friends. Those that were
once true friends are still so,
those that are not, neuer
were. If they had been of

vs, they would haue continued
with vs. If they had
been truly Christian, loue
would haue grown in them,
not decaied▪ For it is a speciall
businesse of a Christian
in this life to grow vp
vnto Christ in loue: but
their not continuing with
vs, shewes they were not of
vs: so they do vs not wrong,
but right by departing from
vs; for they rid vs of il company,
and tell our iudgemēt
the truth, which before
was deceiued in them. Yet
that wee deceiue our selues
no more, let vs fasten on
such no expectation: let vs
try the spirits, and if by true
experience we find a spirit
begotten of God, let vs take
him for that friend, which

is better then a meere brother.
Thy heart and his
are one, and they will agree
in spight of the diuell;
though hee come against
them accompanied with
the flesh and the world; yea
if such two should bee stirred
as Barnabas and Paul
euen vnto parting, being
parted, they would meete
in loue, and doe the offices
of friendship each to other,
vpon any occasion.
The heauenly loadestone,
euen Christs Spirit of loue
hath toucht them, therfore
though stirred, they returne
to their point, and still rest
in loue.
         
         
            43
            When Adam was created,
there was no corrupt

lust: when there was no such
lust, there was no shame;
generation was cleane, and
meerely pure: and when generation
was pure, then the
neerest kindred could not
defile themselues with it,
for pure things defile not.
Therfore rightly God, who
had aboundance of Spirit,
made but one male and female,
who could haue made
many more: for though
there were inforced thereby
an intermarriage between
brethren and sisters,
yet thereby was inforced
no incest; for when marriage
and generation were
pure and without shame,
then the brother discouered
not the shame of his sister,
which is the wickednesse

and vnlawfulnesse of
incest. And thus might the
state of generation haue
continued in all posterities,
if the state of the creation
had continued: But man
by his fall brought in lust,
and thereby shame, and by
both a necessitie of incest,
which was not before. For
God made onely a necessitie,
that brethren and sisters
should purely and holily
marrie together: but man
turned this necessitated mariage
into incest. For a brother
and a sister being one
flesh, it is a ground of nature,
that the same flesh
should couer the shame of
the same flesh; which hee
that doth not, goes so farre
toward incest, as hee goes

from this couering. Now
the children of Adam, being
brought by Adam into this
necessitie, were suffered by
the patience of the God of
long suffering, who might
still require his first course
well instituted, that now by
manis corrupted. After that
some of the Fathers may be
thought to haue done the
like by a spirituall necessitie,
that they might marry
within the Church, and not
with the daughters of men;
or by diuine indulgence
and dispensation, God being
the Lord of nature, and
so able to change the lawes
of it, to giue what lawes he
list vnto it, much more to
require the law in which
first hee created man. But

for vs who neither are forced
by a naturall necessitie,
the world being filled with
multitude; nor with a spirituall,
the multitude hauing
in them, though fewest, seuen
thousand that bow not
to Baal; nor any dispensation
from God for it, but a
law of God against it: this
neere intermarriage is a
loathsome abomination in
the eies of God. It is a sinne
against nature, and so abominable
euen to mans first
and naturall apprehension.
         
         
            44
            The course of the children
of God through this
world vnto heauen, is the
very course of the Israelites
from Egypt to Canaan. Israel
is born in Egypt vnder

the seruice of Pharaoh, and
brought from vnder him
by a mightie and outstretched
Arme, escaping the
death of Egypt by the
blood of the Lamb. Gods
children are begotten in the
Kingdome of Satan, and
drawne from his subiection
by his mighty power, who
can onely bind the strong
man, and take away his
goods. By the blood of the
Lamb, Christ Iesus, they also
escape that death which
is due to them, by being
borne in the kingdome of
Satan. The Israelites by the
red Sea were cleared from
the prosecution and danger
of Egypt, and through
it found a path toward the
land of promise. The true

Israelites by spirituall and
inward baptisme are dead
vnto sinne and the kingdome
of Satan, and by that
death escape from them;
hauing also a way painted
out by the sanctification
thereof to the Kingdom of
blessednesse. Forty yeeres
long after their man-hood
did the Israelites wander in
the wildernesse, vntill they
came into Canaan: and fortie
yeeres are the vsuall
time appointed to the children
of God to trauell in
this world, before they
come to rest. And in this
fortie yeeres, the onely ordinarie
food of Israel that
gaue them life and comfort
was Manna from heauen:
and the chiefe food of the

regenerate is the Spirit of
Christ, which dwelleth in
them, and is their life and
comfort. Slender and light
did that Manna seeme to
the Israelites, yet sufficed to
bring them to the land of
Promise: and small doth the
life and comfort appeare of
this Spirit to fleshly reason,
euen of the regenerate; but
it will serue to bring them
to heauen, and to comfort
and strengthen them by
the way. Manna shewed,
that man liueth not by
bread onely, but by euerie
word which proceedeth
from the mouth of God; to
teach vs, that by this Spirit
which proceedeth from the
breath of God, we haue as
certaine a life, as wee haue

by bread. But as at first
there was an host to fetch
Israel backe into bondage,
and at last there were hosts,
giants, & gates of brasse to
keepe thē frō the possession
of the Land of Promise. Accordingly
when Christians
are escaped from the kingdome
of Satan by regeneration,
and walking to Ierusalem
which is aboue, Legions
and armies of wicked
spirits, the gates of hell, yea
Og the King of Basan, the
huge Prince of hel, and the
Principalities of darknesse
fight against them, and seek
to turne backe, and stop
their progresse vnto rest.
But vnto Israel their enemies
were as bread, euen a
prey and a triumph; and to

vs the God of peace will
tread Satan vnder our feet,
the gates of hell shall not
preuaile against vs, but their
temptations shall bee our
aduancements, and their
resistance shall giue vs the
title of conquerours. And
that we may make full benefit
of this example, let
vs especially be carefull to
walke like those Israelites,
which continued and perfected
their course from Egypt
to Canaan; the chiefe
resemblances among the
Israelites of the true Christians
among vs. Let vs auoide
the sinnes of them,
who fell by the way: let vs
make great reckoning of
the Manna of the Spirit,
feeding, comforting, and

contenting our selues in all
estates therewith; in all estates,
trials, and changes.
For this small dram of our
new birth, though it seeme
to melt sometimes before
the heate of tentation, and
the bread thereof tasts not
so strong as the onions and
flesh pots of naturall lust
and pleasures: yet it is of the
wombe of the morning, it
comes from the day-spring
on high, it hath life eternall
in it; and this little seed
shall raise vs vp in the glorious
image of the incorruptible
and euerliuing sonnes
of God. For the weake
things of God are euer
strong inough to accomplish
their appointed end,
they are backt with omnipotence,

and if they wanted
any thing in thēselues,
yet from that shall they
draw perfect sufficiencie.
         
         
            45
            The sanctified soule in
this world is a widdow;
Christ is her husband, and
he is absent from her; The
senses haue their pleasant
obiects to delight them,
the flesh hath grosse matter
enough to satisfie the
lusts thereof. But the soule
beholdeth not an obiect
for her pure ioy, for hee
whom the soule loueth and
should only loue, is gone to
a farre countrey; yet is her
heart towards him, shee
thinkes still vpon him
though a pilgrime in a
strange land; shee breaketh

out into longing passions
and inquireth of the sheepheards
for him: she lookes
by a chinke, with the eye
of spirituall light into heauen,
and so hath a glimse of
him for whom shee is sicke
of loue; for he stands behinde
a wall, this earth of
ours is a partition betwixt
vs and him, and he lookes
through it but by a little
grate; yet still is shee his only,
as he is hers, shee reioyceth
in him, and remembers
his loue more then
wine; shee entreates him to
draw her that shee may run
after him; to set her as a
seale on his heart, and as a
signet on his arme, for her
Loue is as strong as death.
She fitteth her selfe for him

by being all glorious within,
and chastly reserues her
selfe vnto him as a garden
inclosed, and a spring shut
vp. Shee is decked with
fruitfulnesse, euen with fulnesse
of all sweete fruits,
trees of incense & al sweete
spices. Thus louing, thus
glorious, thus chaste, thus
holy, thus fruitfull in goodnesse,
shee waiteth for his
returne vntill the eternall
day breake, and the earthly
shadowes flie away. This is
a sanctified soule, goe thou
and doe the like.
         
         
            46
            Herein is that in expressible
height of Gods mercy
to his elect much expressed,
that the most wise and
laborious men in morall

goodnesse, yet not hauing
grace, passe vnder the Law,
and their very goodnesse is
condemned to be sin. For
such indeede it is, not comming
from him who is the
only Author of goodnesse,
nor returning to him who
is the true end of all things.
Yet weake and sinful soules,
though laden with great
infirmities, by the mercie of
God are taken from the
Law into grace, & so their
many sinnes are forgiuen
them; that weake and fraile
men, if striuing against sin,
though often falling into
it, might yet comfort themselues
in that high mercie,
which laid hold on them,
and singled them out for
its owne sake, and not for

theirs; and that no flesh
might reioyce in it selfe; for
the glory of flesh without
the mercy of God, is but
shame to it selfe, and matter
for iustice. As therefore
we haue an infinite benefit
freely bestowed, let vs
thankfully glorifie the giuer,
who gaue it vs chiefely
for his owne glory: and
withall let vs take heede
that though there bee so
great mercy with God, yet
wee make not worke for
mercie, lest mercy tempted,
turne into iudgement.
         
         
            47
            The obedience of insensible,
and brute creatures
vnto the will of God, is a
great checke and reproofe
vnto the disobedience of

man; Man is the chiefest of
creatures, and they the lowest,
yet doe they as farre exceede
him in obedience, as
he doth them in naturall eminence.
The will of God
is a straight and fixed line,
to which all things created
by the same will, should
so fit and fashion themselues,
that they should not
bowe from it in any degree;
This doe the baser things,
stedfastly following the imprinted
light & law of their
first Creation. So the storke
and swallow know their appointed
times, the oxe
knowes his owner, and the
Asse his masters crib; the
sea moueth in setled and
vnmoouing course; the
starres fit their many changes

to a steadie rule, answerable
to the will of him that
neuer changeth. But man
that had a burning Lampe,
euen a fountaine of light in
his soule (whereas brute
beasts haue but a light determined
and certaine; and
liuelesse things haue no
light of reason, but an orderly
influence and moouing
power fixed into thē)
this reasonable man is
wholly gone astray from
his rule, and not onely runneth
from it but against it.
Thus is he farre worse then
things worse then himself,
and openly shewes, that he
hath fallen and not they.
What now remaines, but
that as this abased Lord of
creatures, hath beene checked

and reprooued by the
creatures his vassals, so he
should also bee instructed
by them? Therefore ô thou
man goe willingly hereafter
to the Oxe and Asse to
learne thy duty. There is in
them, as in the Asse of Balaam,
that which may instruct
thee. Be ashamed of
thy corruption and fall, but
bee not ashamed by any
thing not falne, to bring thy
selfe back to the place from
whence thou fellest: when
thou seest creatures obedient
to thee, thence know
that obedience is also due
to God from thee, who is
infinitely more aboue thee,
then thou aboue them.
When thou seest mutuall
loue betweene creatures of

one kinde, learne thence
Charitie to thy owne kind:
In sum, when thou seest any
creature continuing the
steady & appointed course
of his kinde, call thereby to
minde, that there is a certaine
and appointed course
to thee also, wherein thou
shouldest as certainly satisfie
the will of thy Creator,
who requireth a conformitie
of all things in their
place and order, and the
chiefest of the chiefest.
         
         
            48
            It hath beene an often
pollicy of Satan, when hee
could not pull downe good
things with euill, to pull
them downe by setting
them together by the eares
betweene themselues. Not

to mention the too-much
opposition betweene the
reformed Christians, I can
example it in the quarrels
which haue been betweene
faith and workes, prayer
& preaching, and the commendation
of the learned
workes of some, in a comparatiue
despite of as profitable
works of others. But
this is an vnkindly debate,
and issueth by no meanes
out of the nature of the
things thēselues, but from
mans contentiousnes, want
of iudgement, or ouer-prising
our owne apprehensions.
Each vertue hath her
seuerall place, and in that
place shee excelleth & hath
commendation, and thrusteth
out no other vertue

either from place or worth.
The place of faith is first in
the vnderstanding, but working
downward on the wil
and affections, it ioynes vs
to Christ; so is it the hand
of the ingraffer, it sets the
eye of the soule euer on
God in Christ: it is excellent
for vnion, & for all the
benefits and fruites comming
from that vniō, wherof
workes are a part. The
place of workes is chiefely
in the will and affections,
yet grounded in the vnderstanding,
& springing forth
at the members: They expresse
the vertue of the vnion,
they praise and glorifie
him that bestowed this vnion;
they are excellent as
fruits, but they haue both

being & excellence frō him
whom faith apprehendeth.
Preaching deliuers words
of knowledge, of reproch,
of comfort, of exhortation,
to our ignorance, to our
sinnefulnesse, to our despaire,
to our deadnesse of
heart: yea it teacheth vs
how to pray, it perswadeth
vs to pray; prayer fetcheth
downe grace from the Author
of grace, by which,
preaching it selfe is made
profitable, and life is put into
the dead letter; it prouides
vs for hearing, and
makes vs able to doe what
we heare. In summe, it procures
helpe in all things
from him, without whom
we can doe nothing. Thus
it seemes both faith and

workes, prayer and preaching,
bee of kinne, mutuall
embracers, and farre from
that contention which is
fastned to them: each desire
that their fellowes may
haue appointed time and
place, because in their prosperitie
themselues doe Horish.
Now for the last kind
of debate, which hath been
set betweene excellent writers,
discretion and charitie
might serue for a full remedie.
If any one bee in any
thing good and profitable,
charitie and wisedome will
rather commēd that worth
of his, then obscure it by
comparisons: if another be
more learned, it may bee
the lesse learned doth more
edifie; and sure it, is that such

contention doth not edifie
at all. The Schoolemen are
excellent in subtilties, they
search how things are, they
dig for the roote; and in
sum, if sifted from errors,
and clearely cōceiued, they
may giue great light to the
vnderstanding. Another
Diuine goeth more plainely
to worke, he sets foorth
the matter without curious
search of the manner, herather
shewes that it is, then
how it is; yet he shewes enough
for saluation, hee
shewes enough for the most
general capacitie, and withall
he mooues the will, and
stirres vp the affections to
receiue life, & refuse death.
The first make a few men
excellent, but find not often

a fit great audiēce; they
are good teachers of teachers.
The later doth generally
profit, he goeth into
the wil & affections, & vnlockes
the heart for God,
the seate where he delights
to dwell. Of this kind hath
this age most neede of, of
which prophecies foretold,
that the loue of many shold
now waxe cold, that men
should loue their pleasures
more then God: and of
which experience telles vs,
that knowledge hath farre
out-run obedience, which
should follow close at the
heeles of it; and therefore
of the two, lacks most nourishment,
and incouragement.
Generally, let them
that build the house of

God, if they hold a sword
in one hand, yet hold it against
the enemy, not one
against another: much lesse
let the by-standers take
their swords out of their
hands, and fight for them,
when they will not themselues.
The building is not
promoted by this meanes,
but hindered, yea, pulled
downe.
         
         
            49
            The euils of this life are
great and many, whereof
some are immediately from
the hand of God, others
from the wickednesse of
men, others from the malice
of Satan; and of these
also God hath the command.
These euils are by
men diuersly receiued, some

entertaine them only with
passion, and these cure one
vexation with another, and
adde sorrow to sorrow.
Some by reasons morall or
naturall, seeke to preserue
their owne quietnesse, and
these obtaine not often
what they seeke; and if they
doe, they haue but a fading
and transitorie rest, which
being past, is all one with
sorrow past; for then they
are both like vanitie and
nothing. But a third sort
of receiuers are they, that
receiue them with faith, euen
a beleeuing soule, whose
obiect is God in Christ, and
which looking vp to God,
both sees him, and in him
sees what hee sees in these
euils: this is the going into

the Sanctuarie, where the euils
of this life are only truly
discerned, and so thereby
conquered. For looking vp
to God, we see him our mercifull
Father, vnchangeable
Sauiour, and our stedfast
happinesse: we see that the
euils which he sends, or directs
to vs, are rods of loue,
and their stripes are healers;
they punish the flesh,
and that but temporally,
that the spirit may liue eternally.
And for the wicked,
who are somtimes gods executioners,
he tels vs, that
he beholds their wicked actiōs,
that they stand in the
slipperie place of a transitorie
and dying life, and that
they and their works shall
come to iudgement; and

then their wrongs shall
turn into eternal tormēts to
thē, & to vs into eternal glory.
And euils thus receiued
are comfortable euils, for by
faith, we see affliction to be
a treasure euerlasting, farre
better then treasures of Egypt;
they are edifying euils,
for they build vs vp;
being beaten downe in the
body of sinne, wee are built
vp in grace and truth. So
these beleeuers onely make
benefit of euils, and in stead
of being vexed by them, or
receiuing no aduantage of
them, they turne them into
spiritual nourishment; therfore
let vs goe still armed
with this faith, which only
ouercommeth the world,

and makes it seruiceable. It
is the onely strength and
support of a Christiā in this
vale of miseries, and that
which keepes him from being
oppressed of them, and
that helps him to suppresse
and vse them. As much
faith as wee haue, so much
strength we haue; and if we
lack strength, we lack faith.
If then euils pursue thee,
and thou faintest vnder
them, know that thou wantest
faith, as surely as Peter
did, when he began to sink.
For how can the beleeuing
soule be ouercome, which
beholdeth the Almightie
on her side, euen when ten
thousand hemme her in?
yea, which then beholdeth

these euils short and transitory,
yet by transitory lightnesse
working eternall glorie.
Beleeuest thou these
things, and yet art thou afraid?
it cannot bee that
thou shouldest be afraid of
happinesse, though entred
into through affliction; but
that thou dost not verily
behold and apprehend it.
Therefore hencefoorth in
thy troubles goe out of thy
flesh, and consider not therwith;
for flesh and blood
will adde waight vnto
them: but goe into the Spirit,
where the Comforter
dwels by his anointing,
working faith in thy soule;
there shalt thou find wherwith
to conquer, there shalt
thou finde wherewith to

comfort, yea to better thy
selfe by euils.
         
         
            50
            If it be asked who is the
greatest foole, it may be answered,
The worldly wisest
man. For true wisedome is
that onely which finds out
true happines, and agreeth
with the highest wisedome
the begotten of God; proportionably,
that is the
greatest folly which is most
laborious, curious, and effectuall
in seeking vanitie instead
of happinesse: and the
whilest goeth astray with
all the might thereof from
him, who onely is the soueraigne
good. Therefore
when thou seest a man by
wicked craft gathering about
him thicke clay, and

setling his hope and heart
thereon, know him to bee
the great spirituall foole,
and his good successe therin,
to bee but prosperitie in
folly. For his deceiued hart
feedeth on dust and vanity;
he hath forsaken the fountaine
of liuing waters, and
hath hath made cesternes
for waters that faile: this the
end will make euident; for
then it will appeare euen to
the foole himselfe, that the
foundation can no longer
stand, then the thing on
which it was founded. But
in the ende the earth shall
melt away, & the elements
shall consume with heate;
and therefore the hopes
built on earth, and earthly
things must needes fall

downe, and wholly be ruined.
But that infinite and
eternall happinesse, whose
name is, I am, hee is for euer.
The hopes built on
him cannot be shaken, the
heart fixed on him, cannot
be ouerthrowne; that foundation
remaineth sure, and
the building thereon is
Mount Sion, which cannot
be moued; he will bee left
after all things, to receiue
and crowne thee. Be wise
therefore, O ye Princes, yea
be wise, O yee wise men of
the earth. Kisse the Sonne,
euen that eternal wisedom,
be yee instructed by him,
and then ye shall be truely
wise; his Spirit will teach
you that truest wisdome to
lay your out money, & that

for food of eternall life; to
forsake these drie cesternes
which containe those fading
and dying pleasures,
and to seeke the fountaine
of liuing waters, euen the
God of Gods, in whose presence
only is the fulnesse of
ioy, and with whom onely
are the pleasures for euermore.
         
         
            51
            A great burthen of this
Iland is blasphemy, & the
prophanation of the name
of God: a heauy, yet vnprofitable
sinne it is, by
which God is dishonoured,
and man damned at a very
low rate. So doth this people
sel himself for nothing,
and as seekers of death, rather
then they will not die,

they will anger God of set
purpose, and without profit
procure their owne destruction.
Surely, as it hath bin
well obserued, this sin hath
a more pure corruption
and venome in it, then
most of his fellowes; for other
sinnes haue commonly
some sensible profit or
pleasure to Midwife them
into the world: but this in
it selfe is neither pleasing
nor profitable, but issueth
out of the meere prophanenesse
of hart, euen of a carelesnesse
and contempt of
God. For how can it be, but
God is exceedingly despised
and neglected, when
his name is vsed to make
vp idle places of a hollow
or vnfilled sentence, or to

vent or vtter with some
grace & force the choler &
malice of a displeased man:
But be it knowne to thee,
O man, of what sort or degree
soeuer thou bee, that
God made thee to serue
him, and in part of seruice
to feare and sanctifie his
name; & indeed thou art not
of thy self worthy to serue,
or to name him: How then
darest thou to make him
and his name to serue thee,
thy prophane discourse, &
thy rash and vntempered
anger? It was written anciently,
Holines to the Lord;
and surely where God is,
holinesse is about him;
where God will bring any
to him, hee puts holines vpon
them; and where his very

name is, he will haue holinesse
applied and appropriated
to it. Therefore his
name must bee brought
foorth onely in holy vses,
and an extreamely vnfit
match it is, to ioyne the holiest
name with the vnpurest
and prophanest passions
and speeches. If thou
wearest but the vizard of a
Christian, and a man should
aske whether thou canst
say the Lords Prayer, and
the ten Commandements,
thou wilt extremely scorne
the question. But assure thy
selfe, that God infinitely
more scorneth, that in that
prayer, one should offer vp
a petition to him, that Gods
name should be hallowed,
who cares not whether hee

haue his petition granted
or not, yea many times
takes paines to make it
void. And much he scornes
that any shold say his commandements,
that care not
to doe them; and that the
same tongue which saies,
Thou shalt not take the
name of God in vaine, shold
presently take the same
name in vaine, and so bee
contrary to it selfe, giue the
lye to it selfe, and dishonour
the name which it falsely
pretended to reuerence.
But if thou wilt needs loue
this sinne more then God,
the same God who now
endures thy blasphemies
with a limited patience, wil
one day when that patience
is come to the full

bounds thereof, ransome
his name from thy vnhallowed
throate; and he who
is a consuming fire shall
make euery touch of his
name to burne in thy bowels.
Then it shall bee felt,
though not now beleeued,
that God is still actiue, and
either sanctifies or consumes
wheresoeuer hee is;
and if he haue been in thee
much but not sanctifying,
he shall be in thee much also,
but consuming. Hee is
too strong for vs, and so
cannot suffer of vs; and
though he seeme to doe it
by being taken at will into
our licentious mouthes, yet
it is but as the taking of a
coale or hooke, which
burne, and bite, & take the

takers: so thy owne wicked
words shall fret into thee
and become thy snare and
consumption. But that euery
one may know his part
and interest in this sin, and
the iudgement of it, the different
degrees thereof doe
readily appeare. There is
one sort of prophaners
that keepe open house of
blasphemies, and the name
of that God which dwells
not in their hearts, yet issueth
still at their mouthes:
these are in the depth of Satan,
and be the eldest sons
of hell. And it is to be wondred
if they beleeue not
that there is a God, how
they speake so oft of him;
and if they beleeue God to
be, how they feare not to

dishonour him: who if hee
be, must needs bee iust to
himselfe, and take his owne
part against those that thus
abuse his name. Another
sort there is of them that
leauing the name of God,
yet vse other names and
words in stead thereof, and
so by an euill idolatrie,
translate the honour of
God to creatures or imaginations
of their owne. A
third sort is of such as in euery
idle exclamation or
admiration, at any vnusuall
or odde matter, take vp the
name of God, altogether
vnprofitably and vnseasonably:
who is not to be named
but with reuerence,
and for the bettring of our
selues or others. For as oft

as we are not the better for
naming him, wee are the
worse. These wil sometimes
say, if thou admonish them,
that they meane no ill; but
they must neither meane
ill, nor doe ill; and because
by carelesnesse & vnwatchfulnesse
of speech this often
happeneth, let those that
feare God, watch their
mouth, that they offend
not with their tongue. And
generally let al those whom
God hath mooued to glorifie
him, and to speake good
of his name, teach the
same to their children, that
we may leaue a godly seede
behinde vs in our roome; it
being a complaint of this
time, that childrē too much
learne to speake English

and oathes together, and so
to blaspheme God almost
as soone as hee hath made
them.
         
         
            52
            Custome of euill hath
sundry great euils belonging
to it; one that it selfe is
a long succession of wickednesse,
and offence against
God: Another, that
growing into familiaritie
with men, at length it
comes to the reputation of
no vice, if not of a vertue.
A third, that it takes roote
and establishment by continuance,
and growes so
stiffe and immoueable, that
it is like the lawes of the
Medes and Persians which
may not bee altered. This
course and sway it hath

both in the liues of particular
men, and great Churches,
and that to so great a
conquest of mens iudgements,
as well as their actions,
that they haue enacted
a law, that an euill well setled
ought not to be remooued.
This the Church of
Rome practiseth; but as we
see in the thing it selfe, that
it is a wisedome which ascendeth
from below, and is
diuellish and sensuall: so by
the consequence of it wee
see it is temporally dangerous
to them that hold it;
For this position brought
that Church to this present
weaknesse. Ambitious and
commodious errors had
crept into that Church, to
which, time had giuen such

strength and estimation,
that it was a very especiall
wisedome to holde
them vntouched and vnmooued.
But they that denie
iust things, often prouoke
to the taking away of
them and more; as tyranny
often hath driuen away
kingdomes. And somwhat
accordingly, while they
would keepe their errours,
they haue prouoked men
to take from them that
which once was held lawfull,
though as things now
stand, they may seeme to
haue lost edification. So
with their supremacy, they
haue lost Patriarchy, & the
ten tribes are rent from
that Rehoboam which wold
not ease the burden of his

fathers. This may serue for
an example euen to our
Churches, whereby they
may learne, not to establish
themselues by establishing
any sinfull corruption, if any
such shall appeare: for
that very corruption by
which men shall thinke to
strengthen themselues, is
likely to prooue their canker
and destruction. This
was the iustice of God of
old against the Calues of
Ieroboam, and of late against
the whoredome of Rome.
Therefore according to
wise Salomon, be not wise in
your owne eyes, but feare
the Lord, and depart from
euill; Let all your wise policies
bee grounded, or at
least subordinate to true

pietie. Doe not by defending
a knowne sinne, giue
a handle to a rough amender,
who taking a Church
by the blemishes thereof,
may perchance pull out
them and the sound flesh
which hangeth to them.
The Ancients knew the
corruptnesse of mankinde,
that it still brought forth
tares among wheate; and
therefore appointed generall
and particular Synods
for the rooting vp of them;
our age is latter, and therefore
worser: if wee grow in
diseases, let vs not abate in
the remedies. If we cannot
haue generall Councels, let
vs make true vse of our nationall
sinods by serious examining
in them, not so

much what euill customes
it might seeme policie to
maintaine, as what customarie
drosse it were true
and spirituall wisedome to
refine. In like sort, a remedy
of euill customes is needful
to euery member of the
Church; If thou hast done
euill, amend that which is
past by future goodnesse,
and adde not to thy vomits,
returning. But let all
especially shun and kill the
beginnings of such wicked
customes; for the more
they continue in them, the
stronger they make a chaine
for themselues: so that at
last they are mightily enthralled
thereby, and are
still further from escaping.
         
         
            
            53
            The roote of all obedience
and fulfilling the law,
is the loue of God: if wee
loue God truly, we keepe
the first Table, and we will
doe what wee can to keepe
the second. For how loueth
any man God whome hee
hath not seene, who loueth
not his brother whome he
hath seene? And who loueth
God yt
                will not please
him & keepe his commandements?
That this work of
loue which of it selfe is pleasant,
& whose yoke is light,
may by vs pleasantly and
easily to be performed, let
vs consider partly, (for wee
cannot fully) wherfore God
is bee loued. God is to be
loued first for himselfe. For

he onely is the fulnesse of
happinesse, and all sufficiencie,
since in him onely is
Being, Light, Life, Wisedome,
Glory, Power, Goodnesse.
Other things which
carry these things names,
haue them not indeed; for
nothing created hath any
of these of their owne, but
in him and his they haue
all that they haue, and they
be that which they be. So
God is, and there is nothing
beside him. Secondly, God
is to bee loued for the loue
which he hath expressed to
vs; for loue deserueth loue,
and chiefely a great loue
deserueth a little loue; but
most chiefely that greatest
loue of the Creator, deserues
the greatest loue

(which at greatest is but little
in comparison of the other)
of the creature. Now
if I shold go about to shew
the loue of God to man, I
should labour to bring infinitenesse
within measure,
and to bound within the
knowledge of man a law incomprehensible.
This in
summe may be conceiued:
That God loued vs when
he had but foreknown and
foreappointed our beeing,
when we were not at al, but
only in his purpose: Then
he loued vs with a loue that
marked and sealed vs to eternall
happines. This loue
produced our Creation in
an excellent image, & this
loue to man falne from that
created image, gaue him

the greatest gift that is or
may be, euen his owne Son
to cleare him from the
guilt of his fall by a bitter
satisfaction; and to imprint
a begotten image stedfast
and permanent, instead of
the created image mooueable
and decayed, by a pretious
regeneration. Thus
from God the Father with
the gift of the Sonne, haue
we also the holy Ghost: so
is the whole Trinity imparted
to vs, and what more
can he doe for his beloued?
Yet his loue ceaseth not,
but proceeds to guide, to
purge, to increase, to defend,
to cherish, as a father
nurtureth his sonne, and as
an Eagle stirreth ouer her
yong. Much is our weakenesse,

& much he strengthneth
vs; many are our fals,
and he forgiueth vs much:
many are our dangers, and
troubles, and the Lord deliuers
vs out of all. Let vs
therefore loue the Lord our
strength, let vs loue him
much who forgiueth vs
much: Let vs loue the Lord
because hee receiueth our
Prayers, and deliuers vs in
the time of trouble. Let vs
loue him first for that
which he is, for he only is
worthie of loue; his courts
only are truely delectable,
and his presence amiable:
There only dwelleth the
fulnesse of ioy, & the pleasures
of eternitie. Next, let
vs loue God for his loue to
vs, and be glad that so great

a loue will bee contented
with a loue so narrow and
scant. Let our loue be raised
to the highest, and let vs fit
it to him as much as wee
may, that the narrownesse
may bee caused rather by
the lownesse of our condition
and beeing, then the
straitnesse of our will: so let
it be with all the soule, and
all the strength. Againe,
since our loue is chiefely
expressed in pleasing him,
and hee is chiefely pleased
in keeping his commandements:
Let vs as much as
we loue him so much desire
to please him, in a proportionable
obseruation of his
commandements. If this
we doe, we shall haue comfortable
assurance of enioying

him whom we loue, and
then are wee happie aboue
our fellowes: the oyle of
gladnesse is powred vpon
vs, and according to Saint
Paul, we may reioyce continually.
For if we be assured
to see and enioy God
our perfect hapines, what
sorrow can ouer-way this
ioy, what losse can counteruaile
this gaine? Surely
we may be contented with
whatsoeuer wee haue, for
godlinesse hath brought
vs, the chiefest and most incomparable
gaine. If wee
shall haue the greatest happinesse,
how can any temporall
thing make vs miserable?
If then wee grieue
much, we esteeme not this
happinesse as we should, or

we turne our eyes from the
assurance thereof. But theron
our eyes beeing fixed,
and not on any thing betweene
vs and it, let vs goe
on couragiously, louing
God, pleasing God, and reioycing
in God; in whom
wee may continually and
cōstantly through all changes
behold as ours, perfect
ioy and absolute felicity.
         
         
            54
            In a Christian when he
becomes a sonne of God,
the forme and character of
a Christian and of a sonne
is created in him. This character
is the roote of him,
frō whence floweth whatsoeuer
fruit of good-works
issueth from him. Beeing
thus animated, the Spirit

which hath animated vs,
doth not then leaue vs, but
seconds this his first worke,
with a continuall supply of
strength and increase of
grace, vntill we appeare before
God in Sion. For this
roote is rooted in Christ,
from whose Spirit it sucketh
stil new strength. So we
are not as Adam, left to our
selues; for then wee should
prooue accidents without
a substance, and perish into
nothing. But being grounded
in Christ, the Rock and
the Life, wee cannot perish,
or be annihilated; and herein
is our excellency aboue
Adam. Indeed sometimes
Christ drawes in his Spirit,
and doth not water vs with
fresh grace; and then the

soule drie and withering,
cries as forsaken, Cast mee
not away from thy presence,
and take not thy holy
Spirit from me. In all
this is matter for humilitie
against presumption, and
for comfort against desperation.
Thy goodnesse is
altogether of God, hee first
powred it into thee, when
he new begat thee Againe,
the continuance and continuall
increase thereof is
from God. So what hast
thou of thine owne, or what
hast thou, that thou hast
not receiued of God? Therfore
be humble, as a thing
which in it selfe hath no
goodnesse; and if thou wilt
not, know farder, that God
will take this goodnes from

thee for a time, in which
thou gloriest as thine own:
and by the lamentable experience
of that time, will
plainely shew thee thy own
weakenesse and corruption.
For when he takes his
from thee, thine is onely
left, and that will lothsomely
appeare to thee to be nothing
but dregs of sin and
corruption. Then shalt
thou be humbled by miserie,
which wouldest not by
bounty; and thy own deadnesse,
which before thou
wouldst not see, now thou
shalt feele. Yet is here also
matter for consolation; for
being rooted in Christ,
though hee draw in his
breath, and leaue vs so farre,
that we feele not the power

thereof, yet our vnion still
remaineth with him, and
wee are not parted from
Christ, though his vertue
somewhat depart from vs;
wee are grounded on the
Rocke, and hell gates cannot
preuaile against vs; we
are one with life, and life
cannot wholly forsake vs.
Yea after desertions, when
God hath drawne vs to giue
him the glory, which is his
owne, and so instructed and
bettered vs by his chastisements
(for punish vs meerely
hee will not because wee
are his sonnes) hee addeth
to this benefit another, euen
an increase of grace beyond
the old bounds. So
that though out of our
selues, he giues vs humiliation;

yet from our vnion
with him, he giueth vs exaltation,
that he which glorieth,
may glorie in the
Lord; and that hee which
wanteth, may seeke him
onely, who onely filleth the
hungrie with goodnesse.
         
         
            55
            Death, at ye
                diuels first
bringing in of it, was a fearfull
punishment, cutting off
man from all ioy and comfort:
But when God in his
mercy annexed infinite and
euerlasting ioies vnto death,
death became then aduantage,
and that an especiall
one, as being the gate of eternall
happinesse. But the
naturall man seeing onely
with naturall eies, beholdeth
therfore only the sensible
and visible comforts

of this life, not knowing
the second ioyes; wherfore
his desire being bounded
with his knowledge, resteth
onely in them, and accordingly
he accounts death
a chiefly miserable & feareful
thing, by which he must
be depriued of such ioyes.
But the spirituall man by
the spirituall eye of faith
(which the other hath not)
discerning spirituall things,
beholdeth euidently the infinite
& endles ioyes which
are in the glorious presence
of the highest happines, euen
God the Creator: and
valuing them according to
the ods of their worth, hee
longeth after them, he thirsteth
to inioy them, hee accounteth
death that which

it is, euen a great aduantage;
as that which doth
not take away life altogether
from a Christian
man, but most happily
changeth it, turning a life
fraile, miserable and sinfull,
into a life mortall, secure,
holy and happie. And as
that which doth not take away
ioy, but changeth it,
turning the impure narrow
and the interrupted ioyes,
which here we take in the
creatures, into a pure, vnbounded,
& incessant ioies
in God the Creator. Now
herein is the great difference
betweene a naturall
man and a Christian. The
naturall man is in bondage
while he liueth for feare of
death; hee goes on, casting

an eye still on this vizard, as
a thing of terror & affrightmēt;
he is troubled with the
darknesse of not being, the
fearefull shadow of death.
But the true Christian is
bold as a Lion, hee treadeth
vpon death, as hauing lost
the sting, by which it may
kill vnto a second death: he
gladly makes vse of it, willingly
giuing himself to it as
to a messēger of God, which
comes to fetch him from
earth to heauen, from miserie
to felicitie, from the
workes of the sixe daies
which could not blesse
their daies, to that blessed
rest of the Maker of those
workes, which rest blessed
the seuenth day; it being indeed
blessednesse it selfe,

and there being no other
blessednesse but it selfe. Be
it therefore the high priuiledge
of the Christian, to
enioy death, to reioyce in
it, & to account it the dore
of felicitie. And that euery
Christian may make vse of
this priuiledge, this must also
be the practise of a Christian;
euen often with the
eie of faith cleared by prayer
and meditation, to behold
the ioyes which are
at the right hand of God, euen
the glory of the new
Ierusalem, whereof God is
the Sunne. For as much as
we se it, so much shall we see
it to surmount all worldly
ioy; and as much as we see it
to surmount, so much shall
our desire to it, surmount

our desire to the world, and
finally so much greater shal
be our loue of death, as our
desire to that ioy is greater.
Wherefore if thou louest
death but a litle, thy sight of
that ioy is but little; but see
it more, & thy affection to
death shal be more. If nature
run to the eie and eare, to
draw thee to life, run thou
to the word & spirit to draw
thee to heauen. These will
shew thee more reason why
to desire God, thē flesh can
why to loue this life. But
thou likest, as thou saist, the
bargaine well, and dost account
it gainfull exchange:
but thou likest not the
means; death is painful, and
thou art not cōtented to be
happy by paine. Surely sicknes

is paine, but death absolutely
in it self seemes not to
be paine. For the setting of a
ioint is many times more
paine, then death by a consumption.
The conuulsions
which appeare, are cōmonly
from the strife of nature
with diseases; but death
followeth vsually after nature
is ouercome, and then
life goes out gently like a
consumed taper. But if it
must be cōfessed, that there
is paine in the sicknesse of
death, or in death it self, get
thou again into the spirit, &
yet shalt thou see, that death
is aduātage. Al the suffrings
of this life, are not worthy of
the glory that shal be reuealed.
For the weight of yt
                ioy
is an exceeding weight, and

ouerweyes farre all temporall
and momentany affliction.
Therefore if by lesser
weight of temporall griefe,
thou purchase ye
                exceeding
weight of eternall ioy, thou
art yet a great gainer, thou
hast made a most profitable
exchange, thou maist
yet reioyce, and goe gladly
through paine vnto a surpassing
happines. Go thou
therefore, and follow the
patterne of our faith Christ
Iesus, who for the ioy set
before him, endured the
crosse, & despised the shame.
Follow the seruants of
Christ, who reioyced in tribulations,
and went ioyfully
through all persecutions,
scourgings, stonings, burnings,
and death it selfe, vnto

that glory which is aboue.
Yea, let vs say with
the seruants of God, If God
commanded vs yet a greathing,
should we not doe it?
for the end shall aboundantly
recompence the way;
the end which is happines,
the way which is griefe, and
the way passeth away, but
ye
                end is endles, & endures
for euer. Let vs go on therefore
hopefully and chearefully,
through al sorrowes &
bitternesses, limited & transitory,
vnto happines large
without end or bound; solid
without lightnes, & continuing
without cessation: let
ye
                sight of this felicity counterpoise,
yea ouerwey with
comfort, the trouble imparted
by the feeling of griefe.
         
         
            
            56
            A main cause of much
of the griefe and folly of
men is this; That men resolue
to make something of
this world. They raise great
plots vpon it, and intend to
bring it into a Method; and
out of things so ordered to
draw some great happines
and contentment. But God
hath resolued the contrary;
to make nothing of the
world, but to turne it into
vanity of vanities: he hath
set it forth as a thing to be
shaken, to be remooued, to
resolue with the lost fire,
and only to be a schole and
nurcery for the next world.
Therefore doth hee suffer
things in this world of vanity
to run without difference,
yea often without

present iustice, and often to
perish, to be ouerthrowne
and to vndergoe great desolations.
Now mans mind
being prepared to receiue
comfort from the world
fitted vnto it selfe, & Gods
minde beeing to let the
world run into many changes,
destructions, and finally
vnto vanity it self; it must
needs bee that men oftentimes
haue their purposes
crossed by the purpose of
God, & their courses ouerthrowen
by the ouerruling
destiny of God. One hath
gotten him a good wife, a
good house, and a good demeanes,
and is, as they call
it, well setled to liue; he taketh
comfort in the course
which hee is entring into,

and he hath bespoken his
heart to bee merry and reioyce.
But behold, suddenly
the disease of the world
layes hold on his estate, on
him or his wife; and then
the plot is mard, the ioy is
lost, for the foundation
therof is ouerthrowne. Thē
what weeping, what wayling,
what sorrow & breaking
of hearts? hope is turned
into griefe, and the
more the hope was, the
more is the griefe. But the
only way to preuent this,
is, that the purpose of man
agree to the purpose of
God, and accordingly that
man expect no more from
the world then God alloweth
the world to giue.
Therfore let him perswade

himselfe, that whatsoeuer
part of this world he hath
gotten into his vse, that
part is subiect to the law of
the whole, which is bound
vnder change, perishing,
and vanity. And consequently
let him expect no
other certainty from it,
then such as may be from a
state of vncertainty. If he
haue a house well fitted, a
wife well conditioned, a
large demeanes, beautifull
and towardly children; let
him know his house may
burne, his wife may die, his
land may bee taken from
him, by publike, or priuate
enemies; his children may
by sicknesse put on ashes
for beautie, and become the
children of death, yea of

               Belial. Let him therefore
build his hopes on these
things, as men vse to build
scaffolds for spectacles, euē
with a certaine expectation
of taking downe when the
spectacle is ended. Let him
vse the world as if he vsed
it not, or as readie not to
vse it; because the forme of
the world passeth away.
When Gods prouidence
calles, we must looke for
their departure; and if thus
expected to depart, they
fall from vs ripe, and are not
pulled from vs as greene;
but if not expected, they
depart as things glewde to
the hart, which teares away
some of the heart at parting.
Thus not vsing this
world as a place of certainty

and rest (which it is not)
yet let vs vse it as a Nurcery
and Schoole for heauen,
which it is. Let vs learne
here of the Spirit, of the
word, of the sacraments, of
affliction, and euen of the
generall condition of the
world it selfe; For since the
world is so full of miserie,
incertainty, and vanity, it
teacheth vs to set our affections
on another world,
euen that continuing Citie
which is aboue, heauenly
Ierusalem, where is stability,
perpetuity, and glory incoprehensible.
Let vs pray,
let vs striue in this world to
be fitted, to be trimmed, for
that world, as abride for the
wedding-chamber, though
through a thousand changes,

a thousand crosses; for
if wee become inwardly
faire, the King of heauen
will haue pleasure in our
beauty; we shall be crowned
with a crowne of ioy
immarcessible, we shall be
filled with the glory of
God, and the blessednesse
of his presence, which is
perfit happinesse.
         
         
            57
            Consisting of eight parts.
            
               I. Part.
               There is one (otherwise
wise inough for a sonne of
the old Adam) takes vpon
him to measure the Ocean
of Gods wisedome flowing
in the mystery of mans saluation,

with the cockelshell
of his owne wit, and accordingly
with his iudgement
he walkes ouer the length
and breadth thereof, laying
his high and mighty censure
vpon it. The honestie
of Diuines he debaseth, and
preferreth that of the Philosopher:
the religion of
Palestine hee condemnes,
but commends the Christian
religion as a thing
well contriued. Yet his
commendations seeme not
to be heartie, since vnder
them there passe from him
certaine vndermining sentences,
which strike at the
maine Pillars of that which
he commends. The odious
comparison of the Christistian
and Mahumetane religions,

because the Mahumetane
succeedeth the
Christiā, in the pretence of
a greater perfection, as the
Christian doth the Iudaicall,
may passe the more vnresisted
because it is apt of
it selfe to fall. For it easily
appeares that therein the
diuel was lesse then Christs
Ape, mentioning only and
not performing an imitation.
For Christ hath really
out-gone the Law: First, he
hath iustly abolished the
types and shadowes thereof,
by bringing in the substance
and things themselues.
Secondly he hath
taken away the ignorance
vnder the Law, by giuing
such a knowledge, that the
least in his kingdome is

greater then the greatest vnder
the Law: and thirdly, he
hath amended the weakenesse
of the Law, by giuing
strength to his seruants to
performe what the Law before
could onely teach. But
in which of these points
hath Mahomet made any
probable progresse beyond
Christ? Types and shadows
of future things he cannot
take away; for there are
none in the Christian Religion.
Ignorance, hee is so
farre frō amending, that he
is the very man that darkneth
counsell by words
without knowledge; wee
heare of fables and vnlikely
visions, but in sum, hee forbiddeth
knowledge, hateth
the light, & al examination

of his religion. Lastly, instead
of strengthening men
in the accomplishing of the
Law, hee weakeneth them,
by giuing them the satisfaction
of lust in polygamie;
and impossible it is he can
goe beyond Christ in any
precept of holinesse, who
commands vs to loue and
serue God with al our soule
and all our strength, and
more then all can no man
giue. So doth Mahomet
onely speake of perfection,
but performeth it not.
            
            
               2. Part.
               But with two points especially
he seems to wound
the Christian Religion,
though like a Parthian
looking another way: One
is while he iudgeth it a lothsome

thing that God shold
bee satisfied and appeased
with bloud: which though
it seeme mainly to bee bent
against common sacrifices,
yet being spoken without
exception (as it is there) it
striketh at the very sacrifice
of Christ performed in
bloud; and that there was
such a meaning this also
addeth probability, because
in his directions of Pietie
while he speaketh of sacrifices,
hee aduiseth not his
pious or godly man to
make himselfe acceptable
to his Creator, by the commemoration
of any such
bloudy sacrifice, but being
altogether silent in that
point, he saith, the most absolute
sacrifice is a pure,

true and humble heart. A
second is while he iudgeth
it a strange thing that the
Spirit of God should be in
fraile, weake, and vnperfect
men. Yea he seemeth to exclude
him from all men: for
he saith, where the spirit is,
it would produce some
strange effects, as the remoouing
of mountaines; it
wold appeare in the whole
course of man, and nothing
in the world could shake
vs.
            
            
               3. Part.
               To answer these things
first in the roote: The very
roote of this kinde of sayings
and misbeleefes, is the
naturall wisedome of man,
which is indeede folly. For
it selfe thinking wisely of it

selfe, and making it selfe the
measure of all things, yea
of the Diuinity it selfe, it
contracteth or disposeth,
that, and all other things
according to its owne measure
and iudgement. But
herein are two faults; The
one is: Because the wisedome
of man, at the best is
narrow and shallow, in regard
of the wisedome of
God, and cannot pierce vnto
the depth, or comprehend
the breadth of that
which is deeper and larger
then it selfe: yea in familiar
and daily things, our wisedome
lyeth downe, being
dazled and amazed. So that
if God please to set forth
any deepe iudgement or
wisedome of his, it is beyond

& without our iudgements;
therefore can they
see nothing therein, but rather
are offended with it.
Then the truly wise man
cryeth out with Saint Paul:
O the depth of the iudgements
of God! and so leaueth
with admiration; and
then the foolish wise man
saith, That which he comprehendeth
not, is not, but
that the very wisedome of
God is foolishnesse: Another
fault is, because our
wisedome besides the shallownesse
and narrownesse
thereof, is corrupted and
peruerted: The flesh lyeth
on the soule, as a finger vpon
the strings of a Lute, and
makes it to sound, speake
& to be wise, according to

the nature of that which
stoppeth it. Now the flesh
hath this corruption in it,
that it is auerted from God
our true soueraigne good,
& turneth to the creature,
setting her happinesse theron:
This it soundeth still
vnto the vnderstanding on
which it lyeth; this way it
turneth stiffely the will, so
that the wisedome of God,
which teacheth the contrary
is lothsome to it, it is hated
and condemned of it.
And ouercome with these
two infirmities, it seemes
this man hath by them examined
these great mysteries
of God: Whereas by
strong mortification of this
fleshly wisedome, and the
helpe of the Spirit obtained

by earnest Prayer, hunger
and thirst, the flesh beeing
made quiet & vnmoouing,
and the Spirit opening the
blind eyes of his, and our
soules, hee and we might
perceiue a high wisedome
in these matters of God, yea
and we shall perceiue the
reason why wee could not
before perceiue them.
            
            
               4. Part.
               But particularly to answer
the branches: For the
first, there is no reason why
God should bee imagined
without iustice, and why iustice
should be considered
without a will of punishing
faults, and why the punishment
of faults committed
against God the chiefest essence,
shold not be a chiefe

punishment euen of bloud
and death, which is allowed
for offences against men.
And proportionably beleeuing
mercie to bee in the
same God, we may reasonably
beleeue that mercy may
take the punishment of one
for another, this other beeing
vnited to that one, and
so consequently, the punishment
beeing one the
same, they both being made
one. Againe if there may be
such a sacrifice of one for another,
why should not the
bloud of beasts, serue to
teach men that sacrifice vnto
their eternall preseruation,
aswell as bee daily shed
for their temporall nourishment,
man being their end,
& God their Creator, who

therefore may appoint this
vse of them, vnto man as
well as the other? Now for
the second branch, that the
Spirit of God would shew
wonderfull effects: First
who hath tyed God to giue
such a measure of his Spirit
as this man listeth? But it is
still in the hands of God to
dispose his gifts in his own
measure. If it please him he
may separate the gift of sanctification
from the gift of
miracles, giuing one & not
the other: yea in very sanctification
hee may kindle
vs sometimes as flaxe that
doth but smoake: and shall
I say then, that except I see
the flame I will not beleeue
that there is any fire? Yet
his graces in many are so

strong, that they are plainly
apparant, and cry out loudly,
the power of God, & not
of mā. For is it not a power
euidently supernatural, that
men truly possessed of their
wits, seeing and willing,
fight, subdue and forsake
their owne deerest affections,
and sweetest pleasures,
which they see and feele;
yea, leaue the world, and
life it selfe, to please God
whom they see not, to serue
him, to obtaine him: where
as the generall world, yea,
and the wisest of them
doth cleane contrary? Doth
not this shew they are moued
with a spirit different
from the spirit of the world,
yea, & contrary to it, which
is a diuine Spirit? For

nothing but God can turne
mans hart vnto God, being
naturally fixed and nailed
to the world.
            
            
               Part. 5.
               But true it is, that God
hath so disposed of this
grace, that he leaueth in vs
infirmity still to combat
with it, and sometimes to
quaile it for a time. The reasons
hereof are diuers: first,
hee will get glory by our
weaknes; for we being in a
fight with our neerest flesh,
and the next world, and the
diuell, the Prince of this
world; strong, mighty and
ouermatching enemies; the
glorie must needs bee his, if
wee that are too weake for
them, ouercome them. And
againe, the lesse power hee

performes the victory withall,
the more is his glory; for
thereby it appeareth, that
the weaknesse of God is
stronger then the strength
of Satan. Again, this world
is a place appointed by him
to bee blotted out, and accordingly
it is to man a
place of vnrest, of fighting,
of striuing; his rest is aboue,
his victorie is aboue. Therfore
God setteth vs not
here in a steady, victorious,
and glorious grace, lest with
Peter wee should desire to
build Tabernacles heere,
where the foundations
must bee remooued: but
hee keepeth rest, triumph,
and glorie for vs in the
world to come, wherein
is the perfect rest, euen

the pure Sabbath of God.
Then shall it apparantly be
his glorie, that hee hath
made so small a seede of
grace, to bring foorth such
a haruest of glorie; and that
with Manna, which to carnall
men seemeth a light
bread, he bringeth men to
Canaan, euen the land of
rest and happinesse.
            
            
               6. Part.
               Now to returne him
some trafficke for his obseruations,
three notes and
markes I will here set vpon
carnall wise men, each of
them being an imperfection,
which spoiles their discoursing
of Diuinitie, and
Christ the chiefe part therof;
euen the ignorance of

three things, which few of
them haue the knowledge
to see, consider, and confesse,
yet are they certainely
true, and truly shewed in the
doctrine of Christ, and
therefore commends this
doctrine aboue all other.
One is the storie of mans
fall, a true and vnmoueable
ground of Christian Religion,
and whereon Christ necessarily
is to be brought in
to satisfie for the faults, and
to rectifie the crookednesse
thereof. Now this is manifest
to vs, only by the word
of life, yet it is necessarily inforced
on any cleare vnderstanding.
For it may be easily
seene and belieued, that
a creature so wicked, so
blind, so subiect to euery

passion and vice, was neuer
let out, as he now is, from
the hands of a most wise,
and powerfull essence; and
that to gouerne a great
world, whereof hee is not
worthy, as he is, to be a partie,
he being so extremely
vitious and corrupt, and
most creatures being more
orderly then himselfe.
            
            
               7. Part.
               Againe, another folly
and blindnesse of theirs is,
that they see not the resurrection:
it is impossible, that
the end of mans bodie
should bee this present life.
For then might we say with
these Author, that there
might be some pleasure taken
aboue in the torments
here below. For what generally

doe wee see here but
miseries, paines, oppression,
diuers tortures, diuers
deaths, diuers heart-breakings,
care within, and labour
without: a few onely
liuing in some ease, of
which again but a few scape
a great taste of miserie. Indeed,
were there no life but
this, we might verily think
that man was appointed to
be borne, to liue and die in
a Iayle, wherein hee is tied
and bound vp to miserie;
and that this world was set
forth for a spectacle of torments
& massacres: wherein
wee should infinitely
wrong the infinite wisdom
and goodnesse of the great
cause of al things. But as we
haue learnd of God our own

fall and present miserie, so
withall wee haue learned a
remedie for our fall, and a
way out of this miserie into
felicitie. We know and belieue,
that the bodie dying,
returnes into that which it
was, and that is dust; and if
being dust at first, it was
then quickned; wee know
hee that quickned dust at
first, can quicken dust at
last, hee being the same for
euer; yea, wee know that
small portion of his Spirit
which is in vs, is abundantly
able to performe it. Wee
doubt not, but a little power
included in an Acorne, is
able to raise out of it a
mightie Oake, because wee
see it; and we may as easily
belieue, that this Spirit

which now shewes a farre
greater power in our sanctification,
may also raise out
of our dust, a heauenly and
glorious bodie. To him
that hath done so great
workes daily seene, there
wanteth no power to do as
great things yet vnseene.
For God hath not bounded
his power by his works, but
if his wil be to worke more,
his power is still sufficient
to proceede in working.
Now that it is his will, his
word doth plainely shew:
blessed bee hee, who hath
both willed it, and shewed
it; and God, the Author of
these and all other good
gifts, stablish vs which belong
to him, in the knowledge
and embracement of

this his sauing truth, that
liuing and dying therein,
we may passe from this life,
which is worse then death,
vnto a true life of blisse and
happinesse.
            
            
               Part. 8.
               Another thing which
flesh and blood hath not
fully discouered, and which
hath been the author both
of our fall and miserie, and
implieth a necessitie of a
preseruer and redeemer; is
a State, body politicke, and
kingdome of euill spirits,
which effectuall in craft,
mightie in power, diligent
in watchfulnesse: and hauing
all these their powers
emploied and moued by an
endles and great malice towards
mākind, go stil about

seeking the mischiefe and
ruine of weak & silly man,
vnable of himselfe to stand
against this Leuiathan; and
therefore necessarily wanting
the helpe of a preseruer
and redeemer. Without a
preseruer we cannot preuent
the euils to come; for against
so mighty enemies, we must
bee hedged about with a
prouidence mightier then
the force of our enemies; els
can we not be safe from our
enemies, but shold be continually
deuoured by them.
And we neede a redeemer,
for ye
                   euils already by these
enemies brought vpon vs:
for these euils we our selues
can by no meanes take
from our selues, nor free
our selues from the tyranny

which Satan hath
alreadie brought vpon vs.
Therefore this strong man
must bee bound by some
stronger then himselfe, and
so we which were before
his possession, may be made
free from that bondage.
Now the highest power
only is master of this power
of darknesse; and therefore
he only must performe
this worke. Some short and
small viewes of some outward,
bodily and dissembled
workings of these
Principalities, the Heathen
haue obserued in their stories
of witchcrafts, oracles,
and apparitions; which witnesse
against themselues;
that there are such a people,
and that at times they are

very mischieuous and malicious;
but the craft of this
kingdome is so great, & the
ignorance of man so grosse,
that sometimes vnder the
shew of doing good, as cures
and the like, and sometimes
by foretelling future euents
(so hiding still their principall
malice, which was to
the soule and eternall life of
man) they haue won silly
men to take them for gods,
who are their sworne and
most fierce enemies: so farre
are men from knowing,
they are a kingdome combined
against mankind.
But Christ by his doctrine,
and the doctrine of his seruants
the Apostles, hath
described them by name,
hath shewed their nature,

hath set foorth their malice
and rage against man,
which begunne with the
first man, and continuing
from thence increase
now towardes the last
of men. Hee hath also
set foorth a remedie
against all his hurt and
power, and that is euen
in this flesh which in the
first man the Diuell conquered.
For God will shew
to his owne glorie, and
the vtter confusion of this
proud & malicious Prince,
that by that verie weake
creature, which no way
heeretofore was not able
to match with him,
God is able to breake his
head, if hee doe but vnite
and ioyne himselfe

therewith. And that of
these men which thus were
in the first man foyled
and ouercome, hee is able
to set vp a kingdome
mighty and durable, which
shall stand invincible in
this world against the
powerfull kingdome of
Satan, and the vnpreuailing
gates of hell, and
shall at last (ouercomming
these mightie enemies)
passe victorious vnto glorie
and life euerlasting.
Euen this performe in vs
O Lord thy weake seruants:
weake in our selues,
but strong in thee. Let
thy power in vs, ouercome
that power, which
without thee, would ouercome
vs. And let vs

being strengthned by thee,
march valiantly against our
enemies, being assured of
conquest, through that
mightie one who loueth
and supporteth vs.
            
         
         
            58
            The end seemes to vs to
bee caused by the meanes,
and so at last it is; but the
end is indeed first, and most
chiefely the cause of the
meanes: for God proposing
his end, this end caleth
out such meanes, as shall
accomplish it selfe, so that
it causeth that to be, which
causeth it selfe. So in the
Scripture, when diuers
things happened, it is said,
that they happened, that it
might bee fulfilled, which
God had before purposed:

so that Gods purpose was
the cause of the beeing of
those actions which fulfilled
his purpose. Therefore
if we go to the roote of the
matter, wee may perceiue
that foolishly wee reason,
when we are discontented
with the meanes, saying, If
this meanes had not beene,
this action had not come
to passe; whereas we should
reason this, If this action
had not beene appointed
to come to passe, these effectual
meanes had not falne
out. Then run we to see the
true cause of things, euen
to Gods prouidence and
purpose, which to the godly
is a sure rest and refuge,
since therby al euents must
turne to the best to Gods

children, though effected
by the malice and wickednesse
of men. For this purpose
of God is rooted in
Loue, and loue purposeth
all for the good of that
which it loueth: so through
whatsoeuer kinde of actions
it passeth, it still remaineth
one & vnchangeable,
bringing forth stedfastly
fruit proportionable to the
roote of loue. Gods purpose
cannot be hindered or
altered by men, but passeth
along conquering and preuailing,
vnchanged it selfe
and changing all things, to
it selfe, and it owne goodnesse:
So Shimei his cursing
might produce a blessing
to Dauid, and Iudas treason
did procure the saluation

of mankinde.
         
         
            59
            Consisting of Parts.
            
               1. Part.
               It is a strange thing that
in this broad day light, any
man should stumble at the
Popes supremacy in spirituall,
much lesse in temporall
matters. If with the Apostles
wee will but testifie
what we see, we on whom
the truth clearely shineth
cannot chuse but see that
this supremacy is a thing
much yonger then the
Christian Religion; which
prospered before it was,
and that much better then
since Religion was put out

to nurse vnto it. If we will
begin with Christ, Christ
equally endoweth his Apostles
with power of binding
and loosing; and equally
appoints al nations
vnto them. If Christ should
haue said, That on Peter
he would build his Church
(which he speaketh of him
only who only is the Rock,
1. Cor. 10.) yet Peter answering
for all, should receiue
this in the behalfe of all, for
whom hee answered. For
since it was forbidden to
all of thē to tell who Christ
was, it seemes all ioyned
with Peter in the knowledg
and confession of Christ,
and so all had interest in the
benefit of that knowledge
and confession. Againe, if

at that time it should only
haue beene spoken only to
Peter, wee haue another
Scripture which equalleth
the other Apostles with
him, euen in the building
of the Church; while it sayeth,
the Church is built vpon
the foundation of the
Apostles: so that the Apostles
are ioyned together
promiscuously, not differently,
towards the making
vp of the foundation. Besides,
Paul plainely answereth
that he is not a whit inferiour
to the chiefest of
the Apostles; that he had of
Peter the right hand of
fellowship, not of inferiority:
& which most cuts
off the Pope from claiming
vs who are Gentiles by Peter,
                  
and turnes him ouer to
fetch his especiall claime
by Paul, Paul saith that the
Apostleship of the circumcision
or Iewes was committed
to Peter, and of the
Gentiles especially to him:
To this Eusebius giues his
testimony, saying, that Peter
though cōming among
the Gentiles, yet preached
only to the Iewes, & withall
brings forth his first Epistle,
as that which was directed
particularly to his
own charge the Iewes. And
this indeede best fitteth
with the History, which reporteth,
that Peter and Paul
exercised their Apostleships
together at Rome, which
might most orderly be performed,
if the one taught

there the Circumcisiō; the
other the Gentiles. Therefore
let the Pope take heed
how he robs Paul, to giue
vnto Peter; for hee robbes
his best title, to giue to his
worse; but hereafter let him
find some new exposition
of building the Church so
vpon Peter; that Paul also
may haue a great part in
the foundation wheron the
Church is built. Now if we
descend from the Apostles
(betweene whome if there
be any oddes in right to vs,
it appeares to be on Paules
side) to examine whether any
such supremacy descended
from among them, to
the succeeding ages, wee
shall finde none in diuers
hundred years. The church

of Rome indeede was a famous
Church, founded by
the Apostles, flourishing
with godly Bishops and
Martyrs, and full of Saints;
and therefore by many holy
men, great and large titles
were giuen to her, and
her Bishops, in letters and
writings. So might shee for
the eminencie thereof, be
called the first Church or
the chiefest Church, and
the Bishops, the Bishops of
the chiefest Church; but a
meane vnderstāding knows
there is great oddes, betweene
being first in order,
and a head in gouernment.
And this the practise of
those times plainly declared;
for though they had
giuen neuer so many good

words to the Bishops and
Church of Rome, yet as
soone as the Bishop of
Rome intermedled with
their gouernment, they
presētly rose vp against him:
so did Cyprian; yea a councell
of African Bishops, and
among them Saint Austin,
walled vp their countrey
from the command of the
Romane Bishops. Euen in
the very matter of excommunication,
wherein is the
pretented eminēce of their
power, Irenaeus a Bishop of
France & the Popes neighbour,
reprooued Victor, a
Bishop of Rome for excō
                  municating
the Churches
of Asia vpon the obseruation
of Easter. And when
Constantinus vniustly checked

                  Liberius the Bishop of
Rome for maintaining the
cause of Athanasius with
these words, How great a
part of the world art thou,
that thou alone shouldest
iustifie a wicked man, and
trouble the peace of the
world? neither Constantinus
acknowledged any supremacy
in Liberius: neither
did Liberius in his answer
(though hee had occasion
giuen to tell how great and
Catholike a head hee was)
thereby iustifie his doings.
To conclude, (for particulars
are infinite, and this
matter is commonly handled;)
at length by a councel,
Christendome was committed
to fiue Patriarches;
of Rome, Constantinople,

Alexandria, Antioch, and
Ierusalem: of which Rome
was the first, but had no
more authoritie ouer the
rest, then the second had ouer
the third; the authoritie
of no one being subalterne,
or subiect to other. And the
proportionable practise of
diuers of these Patriarches
yet standing, giueth hereunto
confirmation. But the
same corruption of mans
nature, which in a clowne
stirreth vp an ambitious desire
to be a gentleman, of a
gentleman to become a
nobleman, and of a nobleman
to become a king; being
in a Pope as much as in
other men, hath wrought
the same effect in him, that
it hath in others. And so

from being a Patriarch he
hath laboured to bee the
head of the Patriarches,
that is, an vniuersall Patriarch;
and from being and vniuersall
Patriarch, to be an
vniuersall Emperour. So
Ambition still ascends, making
one degree of honor,
but a stayre whereon to
mount it selfe vp to another;
and by this meanes at
length hee is come to that
all-comprehending toppe
wherin he meetes iust with
the title prepared for him
by Saint Paul: As God, in
the temple of God, aboue
al that is called God. But he
must remember that thereunto
are annexed these two
other titles, the man of sin,
and the sonne of perdition.
            
            
               
               2. Part.
               These things beeing so
euident, most lamentable
it is that there should bee
plotted and deuised an ignorance
so grosse that it
seeth them not; that there
should bee miracles by the
diuell wrought or forged to
stand betweene the eyes of
men, and this reuealed Antichrist:
that there should
be distinctions coined subtill
enough for lesse subtill
soules, to distinguish to the
manifest Antichrist from it
selfe. Yet all these things are
prouided by the seruants of
this sonne of perdition,
and so powerfull, that it
is Gods election onely
which mainely preserues
those that stand and withstands

this Mysterie of
Satan. And indeede how
can that ignorance, which
is inioyned to the disciples
of Rome, be brokē through
by them, which are bound
thereunto by a solemne
vow, and vnder feareful penalties?
They must know
but what deceiueth them,
vntill they be so throughly
deceiued, that it is almost
impossible to bee vndeceiued
againe. But this let
them take with it, that the
same ignorance will serue
to breede vp a man in any
religiō, be it neuer so grosse;
and at this day it equally
serues the diuels turne to
nurse two of his goodliest
children, the erroneous doctrines
of Mahomet and the

Pope. Yet lest ignorance
should faile, and perchance
a glimse of light might
shine in vpon the seeled
eies, there are miracles daily
prouided to set before
the sight of men. These
draw them to say, that Simon
Magus is the great
power of God: but wee are
taught to goe from these
signes to the Law, to the
Testimony, to the Word;
and this Word telleth vs,
that miracles in the latter
times, shall be fixed and vnseparable
companions of
the man of sin. So in stead
of conuerting vs, they are
acknowledged by vs, to be
the badge of Satan, fastned
on Antichrists sleeue, and
they tell vs to whom he belongs.

Wee neede no miracles
now, but to reueale
Antichrist; for wee beleeue
the doctrine of Christ once
fully confirmed by his own
miracles. Lastly, if yet some
greater light dazle the eies,
which neither ignorance
can keepe out, nor miracles
employ in drawing the eies
wholly to themselues; then
are there prouided subtill,
nice, and sublimated distinctions
and reasons, whose
office is to confound and
intangle the vnderstanding
rather then to enlighten it.
Falshoods are purified and
refined, and made as like
truths, as possibly they may,
that the vndistinguishing
mind may equally accept
them, and so led by a little

mistaking vnto a grosse error.
And hereof at this time
is there a stedy forge in the
Church of Rome, which
doth but expect what the
Pope and his Priuie Councell
say, and instantly they
are ready with their excellent
inuentions, to prooue
it the voice of God, and not
of man. Surely the wit of
man is a powerfull thing in
regard of man; but in regard
of the Spirit which
made it, alas weake it is, and
the effect cannot striue
with his cause, which is
mightier then he. Therefore
this Babel of mans wit
built vp against the Lord,
must needs be destroied by
the Spirit of his mouth. In
the meane time vntill this

victory of Christ vpon Antichrist
be fully performed,
let vs pray vnto God, that
he will adde easily vnto the
Church, those who belong
vnto him; and that they
may plainely see, that hee
who seeketh earthly things
more then heauenly, is of
the earth, earthly, and farre
from being the Deputie of
the Lord of heauen.
            
         
         
            60
            The second resurrection
needes not to seeme very
strange, if wee consider the
first, already done in vs; for
whereas there is naturally
in vs but a carnall wisedom,
that seeth and alloweth only
present & visible things
for happinesse, wee haue in
our regeneration, a wisedome

placed in vs, which
blotting out the former
wisedome, and the happinesse
thereof, beholdeth
God which is inuisible, as
our onely true happinesse.
We haue also in stead of our
fleshly will, which onely sauoureth
fleshly obiects, a
will directly contrary therunto
planted in stead of it,
which hateth the former
will, and the sinful pleasures
wherein that wil chiefly delighted;
and loueth euen
the persecutions of Christ,
which the naturall will especially
hated. Thus by the
new birth, light being created
in darknesse out of no
former creature, & a rightnesse
of will being framed,
where was nothing but

crookednesse, and such a
light and will, that they alter
the affections, actions,
& whole course of mā; why
may not the same new birth
haue also another power
with it, euen to change the
mortalitie of the body into
immortality, as it hath to
change the corruption of
the soule and body into puritie
& incorruption? it being
alike easie to go to giue
life vnto death, as light vnto
darknes, and good to euill.
         
         
            61
            Because wee see not
God, or at lest we do not see
how he seeth vs, wee rather
thinke that he sees vs not,
or are careles of his seeing:
So our blindnesse toward
God, casteth the likenesse
of it selfe, on God towards

vs, and imagineth him to
bee vnto vs, as we are to
him. Herein men are to
God, as some birds are to
men, who hiding their
heads from seeing men,
think that men the whilest
doe not see them. But since
the knowledge of God is
the cause of men, the being
of men can reach no farther,
then the knowledge
of God. So whosoeuer
takes the knowledge of
God from him, takes
from himselfe his owne being;
for where the knowledge
of God ceaseth to
know him, there he ceaseth
to bee; otherwise should
man, who is but the effect
of Gods knowledge go farder
then his cause, which

cannot be. But surely God
that made mā by his knowledge,
knoweth the man
that he hath made; he hath
not placed him out of his
owne reach; but as at first
after he made his creatures,
he saw euen through them,
that they were throughly
good; so for euer, he veweth
and pierceth them, searching
all things by that very
wisedom which made thē.
Since then we are manifest
and naked, before our glorious
God, who both seeth,
and hateth all vncleannes,
but beholdeth with pleasure,
holinesse and purenes;
let vs take heede to our
hearts, yea, our whole
selues, that no filthinesse
appeare to him, lest we bee

shut out from the City into
which no vncleane thing
may enter: But that God
seeing vs to be pure in hart,
euen in soule & body, may
at length be called vp to see
God, who is the fulnesse
and perfection of all felicitie.
         
         
            62
            The very being as well
as the discoursing of our
naturall reason may well
prooue, that man was not
made onely for this world.
For if first it be granted, that
a great and excellent wisedome
created this Vniuerse
which the curious subtiltie
of the parts and frame therof
will inforce vpon vs; it
must also be belieued, that
wisedome doth all things

wisely, both in regard of
order, and end, euery thing
bringing forth his like: now
the beasts hauing a more
easie and vninterrupted enioying
of the world, as not
tilling, or reaping, neither
building Barnes nor filling
thē; not foreapprehending
griefes, nor long retaining
them? what doth this reasonable
soule in man (I
speake of the generall) if his
bound be this world, but
teach him how to labour,
how to vexe himselfe, and
how to grieue, and consequently
how to bee more
miserable then the beasts
themselues? But a soule
more excellent then the
beasts cannot be imagined
to be giuen for this vse by

so perfect a wisedome, it being
extremely contrary vnto
wisdome, that the beasts
shold serue a creature more
base and miserable then
themselues; that man shold
be both aboue them, and
below them: and that man
should haue reason, thereby
to be worse then he should
be without it. Therefore it
strongly followeth, that
this aduantage of reason
was giuen by wisedome to
man, for some aduantage of
man. And if beasts enioy
the world as much as man,
and yet man hath a soule
more excellent then they;
that this soule hath some
happines aboue the world,
which is the especiall end
and marke thereof. To this

happinesse therfore, let our
soule lift it selfe vp that it
may verily tend toward the
end thereof, that it be not a
meere drudge vnto labour
and misery, sinking downe
below the beasts, but that
reaching beyond them, it
lay hold on that blessed refreshing
which is to come,
and comfort it selfe amid
all the base imployments,
labours and toyles of the
sixe daies, in the view of the
happy Sabbath and rest of
God, the true aime of her
desires, and the chiefe solace
that swallowes and
sweetens all her temporall
vexations.
         
         
            63
            The diuel vsually raiseth
temptations out of the

state which is present, and
therefore though wee bee
past one dāger, into a calme
and quietnesse, yet euen
then looke that out of that
calme, also some tentation
will arise. He is more cunningly
and industriously
mischieuous, thē his scholler
the Papist: One Treason
being past wee may not
thinke it the last, but one among
the rest, and so looke
for his fellowes; if we haue
scaped, we must pray, hope,
and endeauour to scape againe.
Our life is a warfare,
which is not a single battaile,
but a continuance of
many. If the diuell haue
lost, he is the more angrie
for loosing, and surely in
this last time of the world

as hee is more cholericke
and fierce then euer, so is
he more cunning. He hath
man at his fingers ends, and
this his increased knowledge,
hee sets on worke
by an increased malice,
desiring because his time is
short, to get in breadth
what he cannot in length.
It concernes vs therefore
proportionably to increase
our resistance; and if wee
meane to ouercome, by
prayer, watchfulnesse, and
industry, so to aduance our
selues in the power of
Christ, that we may ouermatch
the power of Satan;
that the house of Dauid
growing stronger, and the
house of Saul weaker, the
kingdome of Christ the

Sonne of Dauid may bee
throughly and firmely established
in vs, and we in it.
         
         
            64
            A dissembler & hypocrite,
is a thing most odious
to God, and so should he be
to men, especially to himselfe,
who next to God
knowes best how wicked
himselfe is. First, he is a perpetuall
lyer, & his outward
profession, is nothing but a
continuall publisher, and
perswader of vntruth. It tels
euery one the man is honest
that shewes it, and lies
all the while. This lying in
deeds, is at least as wicked
as lying in words, & accordingly
should be hated. Againe
the dissembler is an
idolater, for he sets man in
the place of God, and God

in the place of man. His
best side he shewes to man,
& that is his outside; and
the worst side, he turnes to
God, and that is his heart:
Accursed man that seekest
to please him who is but
thy fellow, and neglectest
him who made both thee
and him, euen the Almightie,
Lord of all things. That
God who is ielous and will
not giue his honour to another,
cannot but be highly
offended with thee, for
preferring man before him;
and to him shalt thou giue
an account for this corruption
and withdrawing of
thy heart, Gods chiefest
part. Thirdly, the dissembler
is an idoll, for he being
nothing in the world stāds

vp to bee worshipped. By
his outward shew he calles
in the countrey to reuerence
him for the goodnes
which is not in him, he sets
himselfe vp on horse-backe
as Haman wold haue done,
his hollow profession crying
before him; This is the
man, whom God will honour.
But this man, the
whiles is the very man
whome God especially hateth,
and whom with Dagon
he will cast downe on
the threshold of hell gates,
breaking him in pieces,
when none shall deliuer
him. And this fits wel with
him, for now hee is not a
whole man; but pieces of
two men tied together, the
outward piece is a piece of

an honest man; the other
and that the greater piece,
is a piece of a Reprobate, or
rather of a diuell. Lastly, he
is a very foole, for of that
which is good hee chuseth
onely to haue the appearance,
and of that which is
naught to haue, a full and
whole possession. Thou
foole, if the shew of goodnesse
be so good, is not the
thing it selfe much more
good? & if the shew of wickednes
be odious, is not the
wickednesse it selfe much
more odious? But thou vnwisely
art contented to be
rotten, corrupt, and filthy,
so the world see nothing in
thee, but an outward painting
of purity, and cleannesse;
so thou maist be to

them a perfume, thou wilt
be to thy selfe a kennel. But
rather turne from thy wickednesse,
and liue; get the
reall possession of that,
whereof the very appearance
is so beautifull and
pleasant; let the shew make
thee in loue with the thing,
& get a roote to thy branches.
Otherwise thy vizard
shall bee pulled from thee,
and thou shalt bee stript of
thy shewes, & be condemned
for that which thou
art. Thou shalt be far away
from these whom thou representest,
and shalt be placed
among such as thou art
indeede: there shal be taken
from thee, that which it
seemes thou hast, and thou
shalt bee cast into vtter

darkenesse. Surely if to men
the looking asquint of the
eies, be ill fauoured and vnpleasant,
much more ougly
vnto God is this squinting
of the soule while it casts
the eye on goodnesse, but
the sight on wickednesse:
Therefore reconcile thy
self to thy selfe, become one
man and differ not in thy
selfe: for if thou agree with
thy selfe, bringing thy inside
to be one with thy outside,
then wil God agree wt
               
thee, and this saying shall
concerne thee aswell as others:
Blessed are the pure
in heart for they shall see
God. But if thou plough
on with thy oxe and asse
together, thou goest on in
that, which is an abhomination

to the Lord, thou
heapest vp wrath against
the day of wrath; thou hast
no portiō in ye
                blessednesses
which belōg to the right eous,
but in ye
                many woes denounced
against ye
                Scribes
& Pharisies Hypocrites.
         
         
            65
            That image & Character
wc
                euery man beares in
this life, the same also shall
he beare in the resurrectiō.
He that in this life beareth
the image of God, shall in ye
               
resurrection appeare in that
image; & he yt
                beares only
the image of darkenesse &
corruption, euen the likenesse
of the old Adam, in
the same lothsome and deformed
shape shall hee appeare
before God sitting in
iudgement. For God doth

regenerate and new create
man onely in this world.
They that be not changed
here, and made like vnto
Christ, doe let passe the
time of Regeneration, and
so they haue the stampe of
sinne in their foreheads vnremooueable
for euer. Now
in that great and terrible
day, what difference shall
there be in the twofold apparance
of these different
sorts? The sonne of God
new made by his Spirit, shal
appeare in the image and
likenes of God his Father,
with light in his vnderstanding,
righteousnesse in
his will, and holinesse in his
affections: To him it shall
be said, Blessed is the pure
in heart, he shal see God; for

God delighteth to see him,
euen his owne likenesse in
him. But the sonne of flesh
shall appeare, foule and blemished
in his vnderstanding,
corrupt and froward
in his will and affections;
and in stead of representing
hee shall bee contrarie and
crosse vnto God, and ougly
in his cōtrarietie. And then
is his very presence lothsom
to the Iudge of purest eies,
he is a toad or serpent made
and taken to bee destroied.
His ouglinesse kindleth the
wrath of God against him,
which burneth and driueth
into the bottom of hell;
Lord, when thou raisest vs
vp, thou shalt make their Image
despised. Therefore
while it is to day, while it

is the accepted time, let the
sonne of man make hast to
become the sonne of God;
Let him put off the goate
which he is, and put on the
sheepe that he should bee;
let him get a cleane heart,
and a right spirit within
him. And because this only
commeth of God, let vs
seeke onely to him; and because
God hath told vs by
his Sonne that he will be ouercome
by importunitie,
let vs seeke importunately
stil begging, following, and
vndeniably soliciting him,
vntill hee giue the holy
Ghost to them that aske
him. Then shall wee with
Symeon, bee full of peace at
our departure, being assured
to see saluation; there

shall wee with Paul, bee alwaies
bold euen at our remoouing,
being certaine of
a better tabernacle in heauen;
then shall wee comfortably
approch to the
Throne of God, who wee
know will acknowledge vs
for sonnes by his marke in
our foreheads, and will call
vs in vnto the Supper of the
Lamb. But then they yt
                appeare
in the shape of dogs,
their place shall be without
from the presence of God
and the Lambe for euermore,
where their worme
dieth not, and their fire
quencheth not. They that
are the kindreds of the
earth, and not of heauen,
shall waile before God, and
theirs shall be eternall weeping

and gnashing of teeth.
The goates shall bee set on
the left hand, God will behold
them scornefully, and
afarre off; they shall be called
cursed, and they shall be
driuen from God into euerlasting
fire, there to accompanie
the diuel and his Angels,
whom in this life they
haue associated and resembled.
         
         
            66
            The hard things, are often
most excellent, for our
businesse in this world is to
striue against flesh & blood,
which is not a matter of
ease. Among diuers combats
therewith, they haue
not the least, who are in the
stead of a father and mother.
The hardnesse hereof

is, that such standing in
the place of natural parents,
should do that right to the
child in cold reason, which
the other would doe in the
heate of affection. Now
men saile with affection,
but row hard with reason,
yet the worth and reward
counteruaile the labour. It
must needs be a matter of
excellent worth: for God
is the God of the fatherles,
and hee ioyneth with God
that helpeth them; hee is
Gods instrument, and hath
a deputiship vnder God; as
for the reward, mercy procureth
mercy, temporall, eternall.
Thou maist well
hope, that God who is pleased
with thy goodnesse to
the children of others, will

raise vp the goodnesse of others
to helpe thy children;
and himselfe will become a
father vnto thee and thine.
But if thou liftest vp thy
hand against those, whom
God hath taken into his
protection, feare thou the
Iudgement without mercy,
for shewing no mercy;
and that while thou art a
very father in law to others,
God will be a father in law
to thee and thine, which
makes men of al others the
most miserable Orphans.
         
         
            67
            Marriage of all naturall
actions is of most consequence,
yet is it the worst
done of any other. For men
doe not commonly make
marriages, but bargaines,

and the bargaine being
made, the marriage comes
in vpon the bargaine. But it
was not so from the beginning.
In the first marriage,
the woman was the principall
part proposed to the
man, and in her chiefly the
Kingdome of God, and the
righteousnesse thereof. So
it should be still, the great
matters of the Law should
be preferred before Cummin
and Mints, yet these
need not altogether to bee
neglected: howsoeuer, that
which is absolutely and only
necessarie, must bee held
whatsoeuer become of that
which is but conuenient.
Examples of holy Scripture
shew vs plentifully, the miserable
issues of marriages

made not in the Lord,
which might be so many instructions
to future times.
In the first world, wicked
wiues, euen the daughters
of flesh and blood, corrupting
the sonnes of God,
brought in the Flood. Afterward,
the most wise of
onely men, Solomon, by idolatrous
wiues, was bowed
aside to the worship of Idols,
from the seruice of the
true God, who appeared to
him twice: wherefore God
did rent his kingdom from
him, and gaue it to his seruant.
But a spectacle of
long miserie, and as long
wickednesse, was that vnhappy
marriage betweene
the sonne of Iehosaphat, and
the daughter of Ahab; therby

was Iehosaphat himselfe
drawne into danger and
losse, and into the cause of
them, worse then themselues,
euen to the loue of
them which hated God.
Thereby the sonne of Iehosaphat,
yea his sonnes sonne
became wicked and vnhappie
generations, this sentence
waiting on their sins;
for the one had the daughter
of Ahab to wife, and the
other was counselled by his
mother to doe wickedly.
Let men therefore be afraid
to infect themselues and
their posterity, by becomming
one flesh with wickednesse;
to marry vnto a
leprosie of the soule is worse
then into that of the body.
A woman is a needle to

pierce into the heart and
affections of man, and if
she be wicked, the diuell is
the thread which followes
after. This knowes the
tempter right well, therfore
by Eue hee got within Adam;
by Dalilah hee ouercame
Samson; by the daughters
of Moab, he got power
on the children of Israel, to
inspire into them idolatrie,
one of his chiefest poisons.
Therefore let no man for
money take vnto him a factor
for the diuell, lest
thereby the diuel attended
with the curse of God,
(which euer followes him)
enter in vpon him and his
posteritie. The remainder
of flesh in the best regenerate,
though but a part of

him, is alreadie too great a
friend to our greatest enemie;
let vs not adde to this
fleshly part a whole body
of flesh to increase the
griefe and incombrance of
the Spirit of God in vs, and
to increase the force of Satan,
and of his temptations
against vs. But let them
that do so, know, that they
seek the ruine of their houses
by the same meanes, by
which they seeke to raise
them. For though Satan
bee a strong man able to
keepe a house in peace, yet
there is a stronger then he,
who often bindeth this
strong man, and taketh his
house from him; or if hee
leaue it to him still to bee
maintained (as indeed hee

is allowed to be a kind of a
Prince in this world) yet
miserable is that standing,
and worse then falling,
which stands by Satan; for
there comes a day wherein
his principalitie it selfe shall
fall and bee ouerthrowne,
and al that it doth sustaine.
And in the meane time,
what a bettering of an
house is this, to increase the
liuing, and to corrupt the
liuers? to grow outwardly
in wealth, and to decay inwardly
in grace and vertue?
to lose in our selues, & our
posterity, yt
                we may adde to
the estate of our selues, and
our posteritie? The true paterne
of marriages was the
first, made by God himselfe;
and therefore to be imitated

by the children of God:
therin God gaue man a helper
fit for him; fit she was to
help him in spiritual things,
euen the seruice of God, &
fit to help him in temporal
things, euē those of this life.
Such is ye
                wife described by
Salomon, fit to do her husbād
good al the daies of her life:
good to his soule, good to
his body; for she feareth the
Lord, & therfore is praised.
This paterne being followed,
wee may certainely beleeue,
that he which allowed,
and blessed the first, will
also allow and blesse all
those which are like it. He
will behold such a marriage
with pleasure, while it is
making; he will be present
at it, for his good will was

principally sought in it; and
he will prosper it, that men
shall haue cause to say; Lo,
thus shall the man bee blessed,
that feareth the Lord.
But because goodnesse in
any sexe is ouer rare; and it
may seeme a hard matter to
get one, that may fully equall
the patterne; first, remember
whose gift a good
wife is, and seeke to him,
from whom commeth euery
good gift. Surely it is to
be feared, that many haue
bestowed themselues ill, because
they sought not to
him, who onely could haue
bestowed them well, or because
they sought him
more for outward aduantages,
then for inward graces.
Secondly, if thou hast

done this, and yet thou findest
not that one among a
thousand; and need so requires,
that thou must proceed
in thy purpose: when
thou canst not get a burning
lamp, get thee a smoking
flax, if not one that is
expert, and by long custom
exercised and vsed to strong
meate, yet one that desires
the sincere milke of the
Word to grow thereby.
Take one that is likely to
become a Temple for the
holy Ghost, and this likelihood
find not in thine own
presumption, but in her disposition.
That this may be
really performed, let vs first
discerne a mind teachable,
and willing to learne. It is
a first and chiefe step toward

God, to hearken after
God. Therefore wisedome
euer begins her speech with
this; Heare yee children,
and incline your eares to
wisdome, and, He that heareth
is wise, and wil increase
in learning. Next, let her be
humble and meek; for such
a spirit is a fit receptacle for
God, it is before God a
thing much set by, and to
such, God will reueale his
secret mysteries. Now because
man is weake, and his
affections rob him of his
iudgement, making him to
thinke that partie excellent,
to whom hee hath an
excessiue affectiō: Let God
bee instantly sought to establish
weake and deceiueable
man; let him be intreated,

that he wil not be wanting
to that, which much
concerneth his glory and
seruice, and the good of his
seruants. And these things
thus ordered, strong hope
may be conceiued, that he
who heard Abrahams seruant,
when hee intreated a
wife for his Masters sonne,
will giue such a wife as shee
was to the sonnes of Abraham:
and he who gaue vnto
Ruth a mighty man of
wealth, and one blessed of
the Lord, because she resolued,
that the God of Israel
should be her God; will also
giue the like blessing vnto
the followers of Ruth. But
while I sing the Songs of
Sion in a strange land, the
Chaldeās or wizards of this

world vnderstand not the
language; the naturall man
perceiueth not the things
of God, neither can Scripture
by any meanes make
him leaue a good bargaine.
Therefore will hee still in
spight of heauen, marry his
land to his neighbors great
portion: I meane his Son,
that would perchance bee
better then himselfe, to his
neighbors daughter, which
perchance will make him, if
she can, worse then the father.
These exchangers of
money by bargaines consummated
in the Temple,
since the Word (which forbiddeth
the house of God
to bee made a denne of
theeues) cannot driue them
thence, it may he a whip of

cords will. And surely in euerie
daies experience, such
a one is laid soundly on many
of their backes. And
therein a twofold cord, that
breaketh both bones and
hearts is especially remarkable.
One is the often dislike
betweene such vnhallowed,
or at least, vnequall
parties. Religion is the truest
and strongest bond of
loue; where that failes, nature
is next, which is most
corrupt. Nature delightes
in new lusts, and so runnes
after that which it hath not,
neglecting what it hath.
Hence hath that cursed
speech issued from one of
her followers: That hee
could loue his wife aboue
any other, if shee were not

his wife; making that a reason
of hatred, which a Christian
makes chiefly a reason
of loue. And when this loathing
of the partie possessed,
hath brought forth the
desire of another, and that
desire, obtaining; what hart
is then great inough to
beare the vexing and tormenting
thoughts that
swell therein by this forsaking?
if it be the wiues part,
as most often it is, shee still
beholdeth with indignation,
the lothing of her selfe,
the losse of her right in him
for whom she forsooke all
others, and his giuing of
himself away to a stranger.
These meditations eate vp
her heart, and then she curseth
the time of her marriage,

and all them that
made it. When this newes
commeth home to the
churle her father, he doubts
at last his daughter is cast away;
which he might probably
haue doubted before,
and much more profitably,
for then he could haue holpen
it. And now when she
sitteth as a Nun forsaken of
the world, breaking her
owne heart, and somewhat
her fathers; miserie beateth
into them, that instruction
could not teach them; that
marriages made without
God, are wordes, not actions;
since such a woman
hath had much money bestowed
on her to bee called
a wife, and yet shee hath no
husband. Another cord

wherewith this kind of follie
whippeth it self is, when
the partie which was taken
into this match for the
greatnesse of estate, by vices
wasteth the estate
which onely made the
match. This to the couetous
father, is the worst diuorce;
for hee married his
daughter to the wealth, not
to the man, and that wealth
is separated from her. After
this, the man is found, apprehended
and condemned
to bee wicked, which
he was indeed before, but
his wealth gaue his wickednesse
such a golden luster,
that couetousnesse could,
or would not see what it
saw: but now neglected
wickednesse begetting pouertie

makes him odious,
whom wickednesse could
not, and the robbed child is
returnable to the parents
wanting another portion
for maintenance. In this
case also, religion would
haue been a remedie, which
takes men, though not distrustfull
and vnbeleeuing,
yet prouident for their familie.
These be the stripes
of gracelesse marriages,
which afflict both the married
parties and their parents,
and would, if obserued,
teach wisedome good
cheape to others, as they
dearely and deepely haue
imprinted it into these. But
this is the pitty, that mony
is so pleasant and glorious
a thing, that it casteth Sunbeames

on euery person
that hath it, be he neuer so
base; and the yong womans
father hath his thoughts so
cheared therewith, that he
must needs hope the best
of his sonne in law, though
nothing but money giue
him such aduice; wherefore
it is yet to bee feared, that
many gazing & gaping on
wealth, wil follow it so close,
that they shall stumble into
the same ditches, wherein
they haue seene many of
their neighbors wallowing.
This makes sport for the
diuel, and thus is man most
truly fayry-led, euen led aside
by the spirits of darknesse
into the wandring
waies of Balaam the sonne
of Beor, who made Israel to

sinne. But this makes bitter
lamentation, euen the
mourning for sonnes and
daughters in the Church of
God; for hereby hath the
Church lost many, both
sonnes and daughters, some
being turned from a good
profession, others being altogether
bred in Paganisme,
hauing no difference
from heathen, but onely in
the saying of a Pater noster,
a Creede, and it may bee,
the ten Commandements.
Therfore the Church takes
vp her complaint, and in
sorrow of heart cries out:
The Nation is increased,
but her ioy is diminished,
there are children borne
but not to her; therefore
as Rachel she praieth, Giue

me children or else I die, or
else with Rahel she weepeth
and will not bee comforted,
because her children
are not.
         
         
            68
            If a man thinkes he hath
some vnderstanding hee
must thus imploy it, else he
hath not what he thinkes
he hath. First he must vnderstand
and know the
great ignorance which is in
man, and particularly of
things Diuine, aboue vs;
yea of naturall things before
vs; God and the happinesse
in him is farre from
our Reach, and euen in naturall
and created things
wee are suddainly stinted,
our knowledge quickly
stopping and resting in a

confession of hidden and
secret faculties. Therefore
ignorāce cōfessed is a great
wisedome in vs. Secondly
he must know & acknowledge
the great and general
misery of mankinde, which
through sicknesse, oppression,
misery, & folly reignes
in the world; and he must
know into what kinde of
world, hee is borne and
brought, that so he may
learne on what conditions
he doth liue. Thirdly he
must see the impotence
and weakenesse of man, to
lift himselfe aboue himself,
and to adde one cubite yea
one finger to the height of
his Being.: so that of himselfe
he can get very little
aboue the ignorance, or the

misery vnder which his
condition is to liue. But
this knowledge is not that
we should sit downe therein
without vse; for then it
were but a Lamp vnto misery.
But that iustly valuing
our selues, we should bee
both humble and patient,
as low and miserable creatures;
but withall should lift
our eyes (since our selues
we cannot) aboue this misery
vnto him, who is true
wisdome, Almighty power,
and perfect happines: praying
him by an addition of
a new creation to the old,
to raise vs aboue our selues
increasing our knowledge,
strengthning vs, to ascend
vnto him, who is very Felicitie;
protecting and comforting

vs in this path of
misery which leadeth vnto
him. And now hauing
God, by the Spirit of his
Sonne, from thenceforth
in him we are wise, strong
and happie, who to vs is
wisedome, protection, happinesse,
yea al things; and so
we which before could not,
may now reioyce; but in
the Lord.
         
         
            69
            To perceiue and finde
the truth of Christ, we must
not looke into our selues,
but into Christ and the
doctrine wherein he is deliuered,
and which he deliuereth.
For if we looke into
our selues, we can see nothing
in our selues, that
may prooue the gift of

Christ vnto vs. We may verily
see, that we neede those
effects, which by Christ are
performed, euen redemption,
and regeneration; but
that the Sonne of God
should take vpon him the
nature of mā to effect this,
in our selues wee cannot
finde. For first, man was
created without any neede,
or helpe of this incarnation;
and therefore there was
no instinct of such a mystery
planted in him at his
creation, as there was of the
Deity. Againe, man being
falne, he could not see any
perfect way out of his miserie,
as appeareth at this
day among the Heathen
that know not Christ.
Thirdly, were man neuer so

intelligent, yet being but a
creature, which cannot
comprehend his Creator,
how could man comprehend
this mystery, which
was a secret purpose flowing
out of the vnsearchable
will of God, whose Spirit
none knowes but his owne
spirit? so that what issueth
therefrom, is such as the
eye hath not seene, the eare
hath not heard, nor the
heart of man conceiued;
and among these principall
is this mysterie of our saluation
by Christ. Wherefore
going out of our selues, and
not seeking Christ in our
owne wisedome, which
comprehendeth him not,
let vs goe to him and to his
doctrine; and therein wee

shall finde admirable wisedome,
excellent iustice,
deepe mercy, infinite power,
perfect holinesse, and in
summe a mysterie becomming
God as the Author of
it, and fitting aboue all other
the miserie of decaied
and wretched man. If we
looke into this mystery, we
shall see him restoring man,
by whom man was made,
and who better then he?
we shall see man die for the
sinne of man, & how could
Gods iustice bee otherwise
satisfied, there hauing been
a vow that man should die
when he did eate? We shall
see the Spirit of puritie
which first made man to
Gods image, renewing and
sanctifying him aboue the

first strength. We shall see a
Law of perfect holinesse
taught and prescribed by
Christ, fit for God to require,
and for man to performe
to his God. And finally
Christ bringeth vs to
the presence of God our
Soueraigne good, defending
vs in the way from
our ouer-mightie aduersaries
the diuels and their seruants,
whom also at last he
wholly suppresseth. These
things are in the doctrine
of Christ: Things necessary
to bee done for the saluation
of man, but not done at
all, if not done by Christ;
for in no other wee finde
them performed. And if we
looke into some circumstances
of this doctrine, we

shall finde that Christ was
prophecied of inparadise by
God: in Egypt by Iacob, in
Iudea by the Prophets, the
Iewes the enemies of Christ
confirming it. Besides, the
story of the fall we finde fitly
to agree with our present
condition, and that is deliuered
onely in that storie
wherein also Christ, the Remedy
of the fall is promised.
Wherefore one issuing
from God, the other also
hath the authoritie of the
same reporter. And though
Christ haue no need of the
diuels acknowledgement,
yet their testimony may
serue against themselues;
and it was from below if
not from aboue, that the
Sibyl cited by Virgil foretold

of Christ: Christ being on
earth, was confessed by the
diuels; and wicked spirits
at this day trading with
witches, seek to draw them
from Christ to themselues.
Lastly, the prophecies of
Christ himselfe concerning
Ierusalem, concerning the
succession of his owne doctrine,
of his disciples and
beleeuers, became true in
the euent, and as it was
prophecied, to this religion
and doctrine the diuell opposed
himselfe aboue all other
by persecution; wherefore
it was aboue all other,
the chiefe doctrine that opposed
him; in the opposition,
ouerthrow, and vndodoing
of whom and his
workes standeth a maine

part of our redemption
and saluation.
         
         
            70
            The diuels preaching is
cleane contrary to Gods.
God beginneth with the
Law, and endeth with the
Gospell: but the diuell begins
with the Gospel, and
ends in the Law. God saith,
When ye eate ye shall die▪
yet to man being dead giueth
Christ to restore him.
The diuel saith, ye shall not
die at all; yet when man (by
his temptation being become
mortall) should be restored
by Christ, he goes about
to kill that Christ
which was to be the life of
them, whom he had promised
that they should not
die at all. So continually before

we sinne he saith to euery
one of vs, God is mercifull,
and Christ is a reconciliation
for all our sinnes;
but after wee haue sinned,
he saith, whosoeuer sinneth
is not borne of God; The
soule that sinnes shall die.
And to them that sinne after
grace receiued; There
remaines no more sacrifice
for sinne, but a feareful looking
for of iudgement. But
we must cure our selues by
contraries. Therefore let vs
still vse Gods kinde of preaching
to ourselues; which
is contrary to Satans. Before
we sinne let vs set the
whole Law, euen the terror
of God before vs, to affright
vs from sinne, and hauing
sinned, let vs carry the yoke

of the Law vntill we be truly
humbled for our sinnes:
But after due humiliation,
let vs take hold on the Gospell;
which to all penitent
Christians, is the true and
rightfull successour of the
Law.
         
         
            71
            There are two sorts that
reade bookes, to make thē
               selues
better by them: One,
that gathereth from them
whatsoeuer addeth to their
knowledge or vertue. The
other would make it selfe
better also, but it is in reputation,
and glory; for by seeking
of faults and errours,
they desire to raise themselues
aboue the writer. But
I must borrow leaue here
to vse the words of Christ,

I tell you the Publican returnes
home iustified rather
then the Pharisie: The
humble learner is more
substantially increased, thē
the proud Scribe, and the
ambitious disputer. The
first gets into him an essentiall
growth, the other raiseth
himselfe only vpon
stiltes. The one, acquireth
more solide matter, the other
a greater swelling; the
one increaseth in the inner
man, the other in the old
Adam. Surely the latter
with Mary hath made the
better choise, there beeing
no comparison betweene
the increase of life eternall,
and the puffing vp of vanishing
and vaine glory.
Wherefore let vs couet the

best gifts, and though wee
need not put out our eies,
not to discerne faults when
we meet them▪ yet it is both
needlesse, foolish, and sinfull
to vse our eyes to that
purpose onely or chiefely.
But the whole and chiefe
ayme of man in all things,
beeing the kingdome of
God and the righteousnes
thereof, let him in reading
keepe that still fixed before
him, as his especiall marke,
fitting and leuelling thereunto
euery thing that will
serue to this end. If thou
meetest with errors in doctrine,
thou maist warne
thy selfe & others of them;
but if onely with slips of
infirmitie, couer them to
thy selfe and others, considering

that thou also art a
man subiect to the same if
not greater frailty. And so
shalt thou best aduance the
benefite of that worke to
thy selfe & others. For that
which is read by an vnderstanding
sweetned and seasoned
with humility and
charitie, discouers to such a
reader the whole beautie,
treasure and goodnesse it
hath, and bestoweth all on
him. But to the proud inquisitor,
it hideth much of
itselfe, being vailed and couered
with an apparance of
euill cast vpon it by the euill
minde that read it. Besides,
when good things be
found, and among them
some faults though excusable,
if the minde out of

weakenesse or censoriousnesse
dwell vpon those
faults, it is a great oddes but
vpon so kinde entertainment,
they will make bold
to perswade, that the good
shall doe no good, but that
which is faulty shall giue a
distast to that which is profitable.
But as in the church
so of the Church, let all
things be done to Edification.
         
         
            72
            A setled and resolued
purpose to bee rich, is the
fountaine of infinite euils.
For this resolution once
being fixed, presently the
eyes, and the eares are turned
into meere intelligencers
and suruaiors. They
are wholly imployed to

seeke & search whatsoeuer
lyeth fit, and whatsoeuer is
profitable; And withall the
heart greedily stands gaping
to deuoure whatsoeuer
of this fit and profitable
comes within reach. The
difference of things (as lawfulnesse
& vnlawfulnesse)
is takē away; for the strēgth
& eagernesse of the desire
digests all alike into nourishment,
as a mightie Appetite
doth meates both
raw and rosted. It is a heart-breaking,
not to adde somwhat
continually; and if
Nabothes Vineyard come
not, being called for, it is
death to looke vpon it.
What though the getting
of it cost the death of the
owner, yet the couetous

man must saue the life of
his lust; and indeede his
owne life, which he saies,
profiteth him not, except
he satisfie his lust. Hence it
is so many widdowes grone
toward heauen for the help
which they cannot haue
on earth, so many fatherlesse
children are ready to
die in the streetes for want
of bread; and so many vndermined,
sacked, and ransacked
families, being driuen
from their own homes
wander vp and downe to
seeke a couering for their
heads from raine and tempest.
Iustly therefore that
holy Apostle and out of
diuine inspiratiō pronounced
this as an infallible and
neuer failing positiō: They

that will be rich, fall into
temptation and snares, and
into many foolish and noisome
lusts which drowne
men in perdition and destruction.
And how can it
be otherwise? The end and
marke being fixed, the eye
is still ayming, & the hands
are still working toward
that end: And this end being
riches, and not God (for
a man cannot serue two
masters) thither tend the
whole endeauours of the
hungry & couetous soule.
If an vniust profit bee offered,
or rather vnoffered
may bee hooked; the eye
lookes on riches, and not
on God: and accordingly
God & his will being neglected,
riches are taken

howsoeuer displeasing vnto
God. God must beare
with him; for hee must bee
rich. That plot must go forward,
the resolution is fixed;
God must giue place, he
doth not see it, or will perchance
forgiue it. But
whiles thou not seeing, or
at least not regarding God,
thinkest God therefore seeeth
not thee; he sees thee
verily, and will bring forth
thy workes of darkenesse
into light euen starke naked,
and they shall bee thy
perdition and destruction.
But rather breake in pieces
this thy resolution, O man
of earth, whosoeuer thou
art. Fasten not thy soule to
riches which are not worthie
of thy soule; neither

make them thy marke and
end, which were made for
thee: know thou that God
alone is thy end, and thou
art made to serue him only,
that God is thy happinesse,
and it is thy only felicity
to enioy him: that God
is thy chiefest treasure, therfore
fixe thy heart resoluedly
on him, remoouing it
from riches. Change thy
couetous, and be strongly
couetous after God, and
by godlines, euen faith and
a good cōscience draw him
more and more into thee:
and so godlinesse shall be to
thee the greatest gaine, for
it shal get thee the best treasure.
As for riches, make no
couenant with them, fasten
not thy heart on them, lest

withall thou fasten thy hart
to many noisome lusts, to
many cares, and finally, to
perdition it selfe. The holy
and most quiet way is to
put contentednesse in the
place of couetousnesse, and
then godlines will appeare
that which it is, euen the
greatest gaine. This thou
shalt the better doe, if thou
consider the ende of thy
creation, that man was created
not to be rich, neither
is that the busines appointed
him by his Creator: But
the Creator himselfe is the
end of man; neither hath
the Creator made any necessitie,
that a man should
be rich: for foode and raiment,
and satisfaction of
naturall necessities, is his

chiefest drift and purpose
of worldly things. Therefore
in the last iudgement
when it shall be demanded
of thee, how thou hast
spent thy time in the world,
and what thou hast done
there; shalt thou not bee ashamed
then to say, I haue
there done all that I could
doe to bee rich? For then
shall that plainly appeare,
which now is true, though
not appearing: The man
hath mistaken his busines,
that onely studieth riches;
for then it shall bee said to
the couetous, That man
was not made to bee a gatherer
of mettall, nor a filler
of bags, nor a ioyner of
hedge to hedge; much lesse
to be a prowling vermine, a

rauening wolfe, or a roaring
Lyon to deuoure
the weake, the distressed
and the helpelesse. The imployment
of our naturall abilities,
as vnderstanding,
or strength, in lawfull actions
to procure maintenance
for our selues and our
families, shal then be allowed.
For this maintenance
is the supportation of Gods
Church in this vale of necessities,
and so tendeth to
God. But a desire of riches
for themselues, or for the
outward glory of them,
and that setled purpose to
be rich, shall be condemned
in the great and terrible day
of the Lord; and then chiefest
in condemnation, and
of any of their ranke next

the diuell in torment shall
they bee, that haue made a
prey of miserie; and whereas
miserie is to goodnesse a
ground of mercy and reliefe,
these haue made it a
ground of oppression, so
adding sorrow to affliction,
making miserie because
it was somewhat
wretched, perfectly miserable.
To these shall also the
perfection of miserie be appointed
for a portion, euen
pure and cleare iudgement,
without the mixture of any
mercy; and so their owne
measure for qualitie being
returned to them, (but in a
farre greater quantitie) they
shall then taste how bitter
the cup is, which they haue
giuen others to drinke; and

they shall by experience,
but helpelesse and remedilesse,
know the grieuousnes
of their owne workes. And
because this day is by such
put farre from them, and
they comfort themselues in
the delay of it, let them
know also, that some sinnes
are partly iudged aforehand,
euen in this world:
And among them, very
commonly, the sinne of oppression.
For often is it
seene, that the fathers oppression,
hath been powred
out on his owne sonne; and
riches gotten wrongfully
for posteritie, haue beene
wrongfully taken from
them, for whom they were
wrongfully gotten. Wherfore
euē for feare of present

iudgement, and in meere
good husbandrie, leaue not
the goods of wrong and
robberie to your children.
For vengeance and they
are inseparably tied together;
they will hardly bee
quiet till they bee gone againe,
and the beame will
crie to therafter, the hedge
to the field, This is not our
place, let vs euery one returne
to our owne home.
         
         
            73
            Consisting of 8. parts.
            
               Part. 1.
               The Church of God, and
the Church of Satan, according
to the first law of enmitie
enacted in Paradise,
and followed with the continuall
practise of succeeding
times, haue endlesse

warres and combats. The
weapons of the whole
Church are stedfast and the
same, as the Word, Faith,
Prayer, Patience, Christian
wisedome, and the like. But
the weapons of Satan are
diuers, as of a cunning enginer,
that still inuenteth
new instruments, according
to present occasions.
Among diuers other
changes, hee changeth his
persecutions, a principall
part of his battering ordinance.
When God lets him
loose, then hee sheweth the
whole malice of his nature,
hee appeares in the very
shape of a Lyon, and teareth,
frieth, burneth men,
made vp in the likenesse of
torches. But when God

muzles and binds him, that
hee cannot bite, nor teare
with his teeth, and his
clawes, then he putting off
the Lyon, vseth the craft
and tongue of the Serpent;
euen malicious cunning, to
fret into the Church of
God, and vndermine it by
little and little. Accordingly
at this time of outward
peace, he sets his malignant
souldiers among vs newly
on work, especially in three
things, which though they
are become somewhat fashionable,
yet be they very
mischieuous to the Church
of God. A first is to put
cōtempt on the Ministery,
which are Gods Colony on
earth to keepe his subiects
in obedience, and to beate

off the enemies; the Salt
that keepes men sauourie
and vntainted of Satan; the
shepheards which keep the
sheep from the wolfe: Surely
if these may be contemned,
discouraged, or taken
away, how must not the
Church of God become a
prey? How neere is Satan
then to a full principalitie
on earth? Yet these are diuersly
afflicted, debased and
troden downe. I passe by
their owne mutual harmes,
which as griefe wishes
might neuer haue bin, that
they might neuer haue bin
spoken of; so now it desires
to couer with silence. But
the lay seruants of Satan despight
them diuers waies.
And first they let flie at the

very calling it selfe, by turning
the Ministerie into an
ignominy and reproch. If a
man be a Minister, he hath
deserued at the next quarrell
pickt at him, to be cald
pild Priest. And when this
is done, it is to be thought
hee hath beene cald worse
then rescall, euen as Paul
saith, the very scumme of
the earth. But where liue
we the whilest▪ and among
what people? It is thought
among Christians. But
are they Christians that
thus tread downe those
messengers of Christ, which
outwardly by Baptisme
make them such Christians,
as they are, and inwardly
by the word, make better
Christians then they are

yet? Are they Christians
that being begotten by spirituall
fathers, will raile on
their fathers that begat
them? surely it shewes they
were neuer truly begotten.
A Christian honoureth
Christ, by whom hee beareth
ye
                   name of Christiā. He
honoreth him so, that whosoeuer
bringeth Christ to
him, and him to Christ, hee
honoureth them also. Christ
himselfe was a Preacher,
and the founder of the Ministerie:
if thou then despisest
the Ministerie, thou
despisest the very function
of Christ, and the institution
of Christ; yea, thou despisest
Christ himselfe, and
then without question thou
despisest thy owne saluation.

Take heed therfore thou
run not against this sacred
Priesthood of the Gospell,
for it is rocky; and whosoeuer
runneth against it, breaketh
himselfe in pieces. It is
rockie, for Christ the rocke
is the foundation of it; and
what is built on it, is rocky,
as Peter from Petra. But
some will say, They despise
not the Ministers for their
office, but their liues; and
consequently not the good
but the bad. Surely as this
on the one side, preferres a
petition to the reuerend
Fathers, to admit, or continue
none of scandalous
life, so otherwise it giues vs
this answere; that these are
ye
                   more mannerly kind of
men that so say; for there is

a number, which if they see
but a man in black, in their
brauery come off presently,
There goes a Priest; whereof
the meaning is, There
goes a man of contempt,
per excellentiam. But if thou
which excusest, despisest
onely the men, why castest
thou a reflex of thy malice
on the calling, by reuiling
him with the name of a
Priest, as with a reproch?
VVhat is the chaffe to the
wheate? Is he euill? He can
neuer defile that excellent
calling, though hee may
scandall it; the euill is from
himself, not from his Ministerie:
yea, the Ministerie is
good, though tied to an ill
person; therefore is not the
Ministerie of a good man

any way within reproach
for the faults of a bad one.
Let his person beare his
faults, and not the Ministery
which is not the cause of
them; Let him beare it him
selfe, and not other righteous
men with him, which
hate his conditions honestly,
as much as thou dost
him maliciously.
            
            
               2. Part.
               Another notable signe
of the contempt of the
Ministery is, that gentlemē
scorne to bestow their sons
in that calling. If a man
haue a means, he is too good
for God, and he is counted
mad or base if he will turne
Minister. But know, thou
puffe of flesh and bloud
whosoeuer thou art, that

the seruice of God is the
end of man, and there is no
man good inough to deserue
imployment in his
seruice much lesse to surmount
it. Thy meanes are
giuen thee for helpes, and
aduancements in his seruice,
not for discouragements;
and he that made
both them and thee, lookes
for glory to himself of both
and that with al thy might,
not ease and idlenesse only
to thy selfe. If thou haue
gifts for such a seruice, and
imployest them not therein,
thou that wouldest
not serue his mercy, shalt
serue his iustice, and the tree
that would not beare fruit
in his field, shall beare the
fire in the place of torment.

Why cumbreth it the
ground? Hew it downe and
cast it into the lake that
burneth for euer. It is a due,
and necessarie course for
parents concerning their
sonnes, and sonnes when
they come to iudgement
concerning themselues, to
waigh and consider wherein
and in what way such
sonnes are most fit and able
to serue and glorifie their
Maker. In that way let thē
be placed, for it is a way of
safetie, protection & blessednesse.
Any way besides
that, is a way of dragons, it
is the broadway, and leadeth
to destruction. If this
were obserued, God should
haue the due vse of his own
creatures. Many Alehouses,

play-houses, yea many Gibbets
would be emptie that
now are filled; mechanicall
soules should not so oft become
Ministers, and excellent
& able soules wold not
so oft turne Lawyers, merchants,
yea earth wormes,
and Priests of Mammō. Yet
blessed be God, yt
                   hath not
giuē al times & places ouer
to this high Treason & Infidelity;
for euē nobles who
now too much behold this
profession a far of, haue ennobled
thēselues by seruing
a greater King thē any they
here serue; yea crouch and
creepe to serue Gentlemen
of great possessions, whereof
yet France is not without
example, haue honoured
God with their substance,

& imployed it in the
Ambassage of the most
High. And no maruaile, for
if we plainly knew & saw,
what a glorious King our
god is; what a pretious thing
a soule is, what the truth, not
the name of Christiā were,
we should account it a high
dignitie, to be imployed by
God in his busines; a great
gaine to turne one soule to
righteousnes; & a right ready,
& natural duty of a true
Christiā to resigne himselfe
ouer wholly to Christ to be
bestowed by him in any
function, since he is his, by
couenāt, redēptiō & marke,
& not his own any longer.
Be it therefore a law for euer
to the vpright of heart,
that a good Minister is an

honourable man, being an
Ambassadour of Christ, a
successor of Christ, a factor
for the King of heauen, to
returne soules the most
pretious Iewels into his
kingdome of glory; and
howsoeuer, they are here
couered with cōtemt, they
shall breake out in the daies
of glory shining like the
Sunne, as hauing turned
many soules to righteousnesse.
But that honour may
continue safe to the Ministerie,
God perswade them
to bestow that labour in the
word and doctrine, which
deserueth double honour;
to liue as those that adorne
the Gospell of Christ; and
themselues to bee humble,
rather receiuing honour,

then snatching at it. For
honour is best deserued,
when it is least intended;
to seeke our owne glory is
no glory; and to honour
our selues, is no true honour.
            
            
               3. Part.
               Another new engine of
Satan is the impouerishing
of the Ministery. The diuell
knowes that the Minister
hath a bodie, which must
bee maintained by bodily
sustenance, and where this
sustenance is not, there cannot
the Minister continue.
Heretofore when diuinitie
was inspired, not studied:
an Apostle though his spirituall
worke were worthie
of his wages, might bestow
his worke without any wages,

and get wages by the
work of his hands; But now
the study of diuinitie challengeth
the whole time of
a man, so that a Diuine can
hardly mingle any other
calling with it, without iniury
vnto it. Therefore hauing
that only function, by
that & for that he must be
sufficiently sustained; so is
there absolutely no hope of
a cōtinual Ministery, where
there is not a continued
maintenance. Then how
many waies haue these last
times holpen the diuell to
breake off and discontinue
the Ministerie? It is too wel
known that the bellies of ye
                  
friers 1. began to rob both
the back & the belly of the
Ministery. And that when
these theeues were arraigned

& conuicted, the goods
were not restored to the former
owners thogh known;
so hereby many miles together
haue bin turned into a
spiritual wildernes, spoiled
of the ordinary means of sauing
soules; lamentable and
euen a hart-breaking consideration
it is, to them that
haue any fellow-feeling of
the misery of those, who lie
in the bondage of Satan,
when they see many Churches,
like lampes without
lights, the oyle of maintenance
being taken frō thē.
How cā a mā there preach,
where there is scarse bread
to maintaine the strength
of the voice? nor clothes to
keep off the cold that would
choke yt
                   voice? nor means to

buy a very few bookes, to
put matter and soule into
the voices. And on the other
side, how can the Eunuch
vnderstand, except
there be some to expound?
How can they beleeue
without preaching? alas, the
liues of such places too
much testifie, that a naturall
man is like a dog, and
will hardly bite at a whole
loafe; Yea that a man is so
tastelesse of spiritual things,
that except he be taught to
open his mouth, except
his stomach be stirred vp
by continuall prouocations,
he hath no appetite to
the foode of life; That a
sinner is so heauily asleepe
in his sinnes, that vnlesse
he be pulled and startled,

and his sinne taken vp before
him, and the particular
odiousnesse and vglinesse
thereof liuely presented to
his dull and vnwilling eies,
hee had rather die in his
sleepe, then awake vnto life
eternall.
            
            
               Part 4.
               But this disease being
shewed, what remedie is
there for it? Surely the Lord
of the haruest being first intreated
in heauen, there
seeme two remedies on
earth; one is Law, another,
Conscience. But how shall
there be any hope in Law,
since it is Law that hath
done the hurt? Surely as a
Law begotten in the times
of ignorance▪ hath hurt the
Church, so a Law borne in

the times of knowledge
may heale it. Let vs shew
our faith by our works, and
shame the workes which
haue beene done without
faith by exceeding them; if
wee haue the light of the
Gospell, let vs make statutes
of light, and not continue
the lawes of darkenesse. If
wee feele any comfort of
light in our selues, let vs
with our blessed Sauiour
pittie them that sit in darknesse,
and in the shaddow
of death. I separate law
frō conscience; for though
conscience bee the truest
fountaine of lawes, yet politicke
consideration is very
often the cause of them.
Now it is not the worst policie,
but indeed the best, to

lay a sure foundation of religion
in the hearts of the
people. For from true religion,
groweth the strongest
branch of obedience: true
religion hath wherewithall
to confute treason, though
masked in a vizard of religion.
It will allow the Pope
few subiects in another
mans Realme: It will keepe
them for the right owner.
In summe, the end of kingdomes,
being the Church,
and the end of the Church,
the glorie of God by faith
and holinesse; how doth
that kingdom pierce it selfe
through with many darts,
that suffereth this faith and
holinesse, the life and soule
thereof, to bee slaine by
wickednesse and vnbeliefe?

Surely there is a fulnesse of
sinnes, which is the greatest
rebellion in the world, for
it ouerthrowes kingdomes,
and lets out Vineyards to
new husbandmen. This do
Ieroboam and Ahab now declare
and bewaile; Ieroboam
cursing the basenesse of his
new deuised Priesthood,
and Ahab defying the Statutes
of men, it being a policie
to destruction, to bee
politicke against God. But
if it be demanded whence
such maintenance shold be
raised? Surely for worldly
and temporall ends, the raising
of huge summes by
Parliament, are well impoposed,
and contentedly receiued;
& is there no way
to raise one summe for the

God of heauen? When
Moses prouided for the Tabernacle,
there was offering
euen to abundance. When
Dauid prouided for the
Temple, there were many
thousand Talents offered
willingly, and with a perfect
heart. VVhy should
not we much more willingly
contribute toward the
building, not of Temples
made of hands, but of the
liuing Temple and Church
of the euerliuing God? If a
towne bee destroyed with
fire, all men take pitty on
the ruine thereof, and from
that pittie issureth reliefe.
When whole Townes and
Parishes are besieged with
hell fire, how do we not pitty
& succour such spirituall

desolations? Then let that
place which made the law
of substraction, redeeme it
by making a law of retribution,
and by some diuine
subsidie granted to the
King of heauen, regaine
part, or all of the ancient inheritance
of the Church, or
procure some new sustentation
in the stead thereof.
But if mens hearts shall
herein be generally hardened
against God, against the
soules of their brethren,
yea, against their owne saluation,
and denie this iust
and necessarie helpe: Let
those that are merciful, and
therfore shal obtain mercy,
expresse this excellent vertue
of him that dwelleth in
them; let them binde vp

the woūds which the Leuits
passed by, let them imitate
him, who beheld euen them
in their blood & pollution,
and said vnto them, Liue.
Let cōscience remedy what
law doth not, the worke of
God being done without,
by the working of God alone
in mens harts within.
Accordingly should it bee
a sweet smelling Sacrifice,
acceptablie ascending before
the presence of God;
if those who are both
spirituallie and temporally
rich, should out of their
spirituall treasurie, send
foorth that most pretious
charitie, which might
conuert some of their
temporall and transitorie
treasure to this soule-sauing

end. Herunto God through
mee doth beseech them, as
inwardly no doubt he motions
the same vnto them
by his spirit. Obedience to
God and his spirit is the
most excellent offring, and
a soule turned to God, is the
ioy of heauen; but proportionably
quenching the
spirit by disobedience, is a
heauie sinne; and too quiet
suffering of the death of
soules, where means would
giue hope of life, is the gall
of bitternesse, and the stone
of the heart. Our Auncestors
did set vp both Churches,
and Churchliuings, a
great and a large work was
performed by them; we are
but to keep in reparatiō, that
they haue built. Indeed this

ouer boystrous tempest hath
ouerthrowne a great piece
of this building, yet but a
piece, not by many degrees
so great, as that work which
they raised. If they haue
done all, it is a shame wee
should not doe something;
wee should rather bee glad
(though not of the cause,
yet of this effect) that there
is matter left for our charitie
to expresse it selfe in this
kind; and to let blind deuotion
know, that, if our ancestors
had not founded
such spiritual maintenance,
it might and should yet
haue bin done by vs. There
are many godly & deuout
persons, who haue in these
daies of light, made and increase
dwellings & portions

for the bodies of the poore
and needy. Excellent indeed
is this worke, it is a
blessed thing to giue, and
blessed are they that feede
the hungrie, and clothe the
naked. But yet of all Almes
houses, the spiritual Almes-house
is the best, and Paul
that willeth you to desire
the best gifts, would haue
you vse your gifts to the
best aduantage. Wherefore
I shew you a more excellent
way. As the soule is
infinitely better then the
bodie, and life eternall, then
life present, so the food of
the soule is farre better then
that of the body, and the
sauing of the spirituall life
better then the preseruation
of the temporall life. If

thou giuest to the body,
thou dost well, but thou giuest
to that which shall die:
but if thou giue to the
soule, thou dost better, for
thou giuest to that, which
by thy gift may liue for euer
in happines, and make
the body liue for euer in the
same blisse with it. If thou
giue naturall bread, thou
dost well; but thou giuest
that which perisheth with
the vsing: but thou most
resemblest Christ thy head,
and giuest the best Almes,
when thou giuest the bread
of heauen. What a comfortable
and ioyfull thing
to thy soule and heart
will it be to see a whole
Congregation fed on Gods
holy day with thy Almes?

to see many soules receiuing
saluation as it were
from thy hand, to heare
many blesse & glorifie God
for his gifts to thee, & thine
to them? yea to blesse thee
therefore in the name of
the Lord? Surely such ioy is
infinitely better, sounder,
and fuller of waight, then
the ioy of mony, corne, and
oyle; but the ioy that God
shall giue thee in the great
marriage day, in the day of
the gladnes of thy heart, in
that day will againe infinitely
exceed this. Thē shal
Christ say vnto thee, come
thou blessed of my Father;
for when I was hungry, naked
and cold in the very
soule of my little ones,
thou diddest buy Manna,

long white robes & fire of
the Altar, to feede, cloth &
warme me; thou gauest the
best gifts, and which most
nearely and inwardly cherish
me, therefore shalt thou
haue the best reward; come
and sit nearest vnto me. But
if some backeward & withdrawing
hearts in whome
God hath no delight, put
this grace and glory from
themselues, by a perswasion,
that this businesse concernes
them not, but that
euery horse should beare
his owne burthen, and each
congregation maintaine a
Preacher for themselues:
Let them know, that naturall
men not vsed to instruction,
for want of it, haue
no desire to it: Things not

known are vnsought, much
lesse will a naturall man
part from things knowne
for things vnknowne. It is
the propertie of teaching
to make men desire to be
taught: expect not then this
desire from them, which
haue not the meanes to attaine
it; the sweetnesse of
the word must be first sounded
in their eares, before
they will loue the sound
thereof: it must teach them
the worth of it selfe, before
they will part from any of
their worth for it. He must
be partly or wholly a spirituall
man, that hungers for
spirituall foode vnto the
losse of his temporall substance:
and how shall many
such be expected where the

word, by which the spirit
entereth, hath not bin fitly
opened vnto them? Therefore
if thou wilt haue them
doe for themselues, do thou
something first, though but
a little for them whereby
they may heare the word:
And then it is likely the
word heard will make way
for it selfe, and perswade for
increase of maintenance;
for it perswades the truly
sanctified to a farre greater
degree, euen to fell all, to
giue life & all, for the Treasure
of happinesse Christ
Iesus; whome lying more
closely in the Cabinet of
the word, preaching deliuers
vnto vs opened and
displaied in full glorie and
Lustre. Yea it may bee by

the word so communicated
by thee, there wil be some
prouoked, to doe that for
others which thou hast
done for them; and so a generation
of goodnesse may
bee continued of which
thou hast beene the father;
and a chaine of good works
may be lengthned, of which
the first linke framed by
thee, is both the beginning
and cause. Hereunto may
be added this other reason
of forrein helpe; That such
places beare already as
great a burden without the
benefite of preaching as others
do that haue it. Wherfore
that Saint Pauls rule of
equity may bee obserued,
which will not haue some
eased, to haue others doubly

grieued; and that rule
of Charity, Beare yee one
anothers burden: it is fit
that the burthen of such
places should be deuided among
many, so to take away
the griefe of surcharging
by an equalitie, and to
ease the weight of the burthen
by deuiding it with others.
            
            
               5. Part.
               As these great blowes of
Satan haue afflicted the Ministery
in these latter times,
so doe daily buffets, & lesser
pinchings of the seruants
of Satan, follow and
persecute continually the
same Ministerie. His plot
and his hatred still are one,
though the limitation of
his power, by Gods ouerruling,

suffer him not at all
times to bring forth like
effects: He is, God be praised,
tied vp somewhat from
appropriating of spirituall
liuings, yet what he cannot
get in a rent, hee striues to
obtaine in a fine. The Patron
that cannot haue the
yearely profit, must haue a
grosse summe in consideration
of it, and a scholler
hauing spent much of his
portion, spirits, and time in
studie to make himselfe
worthie of a place in the
Church, yet after must he
studie for sureties, or readie
mony to throw into
the mouth of Cerberus, euen
of these porters of
hell, that they stoppe not
his way into the deserued

Benefice. And this also is
a vertue, if they will bestow
it, in this kinde of
bestowing on a man able
and sufficient; for if such a
one bee not very neere as
finable, as a meere dumbe
and vnlearned fellow: sufficiency
shall bee bought
out, & profitable ignorance
shall be preferred before edifying
knowledge. The
great God Mammon must
chuse the Priest that fitteth
him best, & the greatest &
truest God whose Priest is
thoght thē to be choosing,
hath least to do in yt
                   choise.
But ô thou Marchant of hel
& Factor for Satā, know yt
                  
cursed is thy mony with
thee, thy mony is the price
of Soules euen of spirituall

blood, the life of spirits.
Thou hast for that summe
giuen ouer so many soules
to Satan, thou hast giuen
their throats to the Butcher,
and thou hast done
worse then slaine them; for
thou killest them with
death eternall. Christ hath
said, what shall a man giue
for his soule, yea to giue a
whole world and to lose
his soule is a bad bargaine:
but what a beggerly and
bloudy bargaine hast thou
made which for litle pieces
and shrids of the world hast
sold many soules? But to
what end is it to speake to
a man of clay, that hath no
sense nor feeling of heauen?
To what end is it to
speake to a mule that hath

no vnderstanding? Such
men are more dead, then
the Altar which heard the
word of the Lord. They
are stonie at the very heart,
and nothing but mony
makes any sound by striking
such a heart. Otherwise
euen to common reason
it wold grosly appeare,
that a lanterne without a
candle can giue no light,
that a man without sight
cannot bee a guide to the
blinde; & that men led by
such guides, must needes
fall with their guides into
the pit of eternall destruction.
But if it happen that
a man of some sufficiencie
hath like the Centurion by
a great summe obtained
the freedome of this Benefice:

then is the Patron
readie to go into the Temple
with the Pharisie, to
giue thankes that hee is
not like other men: There
is a fit man in the place,
and hee hath taken no
mony for the Benefice
but for the Aduowson,
which a man may honestly
doe. But know thou Circumuenter
of thy owne
soule: That if it were lawfull
to sell an Aduowson,
thou shouldest sell it at the
price of an Aduowson.
To finde out this, consider
what either thou payest for
the patronage, and so make
some proportion by that,
or what a lay-man would
giue for it, that would make
no vse of it, but the bestowing.

For whatsoeuer is giuen
beyond that which a man
would giue to haue the
meere naming of the Minister,
is the price of the benefice,
and not of the Aduowson;
it paies for the
profit of the liuing, & not
for the particular appointment
of the man. Mingle
things as cunningly, and
confusedly as thou canst,
the iudgement of God shal
single thē as perfectly, and
the euill shal be takē out &
shewed thee by it self in the
great & terrible day of the
Lords displeasure. Yet neither
do I cōmend ye
                   selling
of Aduousons though at
the easier rate; for a Patronage
is an excellent priuiledge,
a patrone hath the

power of a great and high
worke, euen in the chiefest
businesse of God. Why wilt
thou for a little mony let
another doe God acceptable
seruice, when thou maist
do it thy selfe? Or why perchance
dost thou suffer another
to doe Gods seruice
negligently and corruptly,
when thou maist doe it
faithfully? Take heede hereunto;
for if by thy sale, the
sheepe be vnfed, for whome
Christ died, thou maist go
among the cursed to whom
it shall be said, When I was
an hungrie thou hadst food
in thy hand, and yet thou
fedst me not.
            
            
               Part. 6.
               But after all this, is not
the Minister fully escaped;

hauing paide the Patron
for his passage, he falles after
into the hands of his
Parish: then is hee like a
man rid of a Lyon, & falne
among Wolues; euery one
(almost, if not wholly) rubs
vp his wit, and makes it a
principall conquest, to deceiue
the Parson. Howsoeuer
the Vsurer haue his ten
of the hundred, the Lawyer
his grossefee, and the workman
his wages; the Minister,
who layes out his stock
for their saluation, shall not
haue his tenne of the hundred,
nay, but a leane fee for
the most pretious counsell;
nor his full wages for his
most excellent worke. It is
a speciall part of thrift, if we
cannot conceale and defraud

some tithes, yet to
make a good bargaine with
the Minister, and to get
somewhat by him; and if
he will not bee so wrought
on, he must goe for a couetous
and hard man. But O
thou ouerthriftie Tither,
what thinkest thou, while
thou dealest thus? hast thou
a soule or not? If thou hast
none, at least, if thou thinkest
so, words wil be vseles,
vntill thou feele one day
by the torments of thy
soule that thou hast one;
and then they will also bee
vselesse. But if thou hast
one, it is better then thy body,
which is also better then
thy goods. Thou gladly giuest
to the Phisition to
maintaine the health of

thy body, and to the Lawyers
to preserue thy goods:
how doth not thy hand
willingly & chiefly stretch
foorth it selfe to him which
saueth thy soule, which is
infinitely better then these?
It sheweth too euidently,
that thou valuest things
backwards, since thou esteemest
not thy soule, as
thou dost thy goods and
body, nor the eternall saluation
thereof▪ as thy present
preseruation. But they that
haue had a glimse of heauenly
glorie, despise earthly
things in comparison
thereof, and in disdaine
say, Is it a great matter to
giue carnall things for spirituall?
such men know, they
cannot giue so good things

to them, as they receiue
from them. Therefore they
would euen take out of
their owne bowels to doe
good to their teachers, at
least they wold thrust their
right vpon them, though
ignorant of it; they would
by all meanes desire, that
they might liue plentifully
in this world, whose life is
imploied to make them
liue euerlastingly in the
next. Farre be it then from
vs to vexe and discourage
by robberie and impouerishing
those, who are the
guides vnto heauen. Let diuine
loue iustifie them in
taking their right, yea, help
them to it, and bring after
them, what they haue left
of it. Let vs entertaine them

as embassadours of Christ
with bountifull allowance,
and not shew our small regard
of the Lord that sent
them, by our ill rewarding
of his messengers. Their estate
is but for life, and naturall
affection towards
their family, is commendable
in them as in vs; therefore
a prouident care, if
without wrong, is not to
be censured, but allowed in
them; and a willing and a
plentifull contribution is
requisite in vs. And herein
I deserue speedier assent,
because I am none of those
I speake for.
            
            
               Part. 7.
               A third cunning of Satan
is to make sanctification
an odious thing, and to

fasten on it some vile reproch,
that men may bee ashamed
to serue God, and
to be saued. And that this
may worke the more effectually,
he suffers many to
goe so farre in religion as
they may, without losing
them, that is, in a morall
and ciuill profession thereof;
but that degree, beyond
which indeed is onely the
very life and power of sanctification,
is very offensiue
to them, and appeares to
such to bee but hypocrisie
and scrupulositie. Hence it
is, that among most of these
ciuilians, regeneration and
sanctification, which they
attaine not, is Puritanisme,
and a true Saint is called a
Puritan; which in their

English, meanes a dissembling
or scrupulous fellow.
And this being the verdit
of those, who account thē
                  selues
for honest men, and
their neighbours think the
same (to whom these ciuill
men are almost Puritans)
like a kennel of dogs, they
runne away with the crie,
and barke out this terme against
euery honest man
they meete. But a lamentable
persecution of tongues
is this the whiles, especially
among Christians, that a
man should be reuiled for
being a Christian; and that
regeneration, the worke of
the holy Ghost, should bee
reproched. Cursed is hee
that despiteth the Spirit of
grace, euē that Spirit which

gaue his tongue that power,
by which hee is able to
speake against the Spirit.
Cursed is hee that reuileth
the holy Ghost, and raileth
on the power of the liuing
God. Know that the time
shall come, when thy words
shall returne vpon thee, as
so many Lyons; yea, the diuell,
who now sets thee on
worke, shall come to worke
vpon thee with torments:
but especially that blessed
Spirit, whom thou hast
reuiled, shall come against
thee, and teare thee in pieces,
and there shall be none
to deliuer thee. Thou seest
in the whole course of
such a mans life, a maine
current of honestie and
goodnesse; and who would

thinke that any should bee
so shamelesse to raile on
goodnesse, and to oppose
against it? For the
verie opposing against
goodnesse, giues thee the
title of wickednesse, which
alone is the enemie thereof.
It shewes thou art a
souldier of the Dragon,
who goes out to make
warre with that blessed
seede, that keepes the
commandement of God.
But I doe know thy vsuall
defences: thou wilt say,
that there are none worse,
then such as make such a
shew of purenesse, and
withall thou art furnished
with some merry tales, that
shew many mad trickes of
these ouer holie brethren.

Heere a little discretion and
iudgement in stead of salt,
would be of very good vse
to amend the sauour both
of thy heart and tongue.
For an vpright iudgement,
as it findeth many truths,
so toward the true discouerie
of this businesse, it findeth
these. First, that whosoeuer
is indeed good, shall
and must also seeme good;
for his works wil praise him,
whether he will or no; his
fruits wil shew what tree he
is, they must shine before
men, that men seeing them,
may glorifie God their heauenly
Father. Hence first we
conclude, that euerie one
that seemes good, is not an
hypocrite, but contrarily
he may bee one of Gods

chiefest seruants. Therefore
thou canst not presently
fall to thy nickname
only for the shew of goodnesse.
Secondly, that there
is indeede a dissembled holinesse,
worne for a cloake
to wickednes, that the shape
of an Angell of light some
times couers a foule diuell,
yea, the foulest diuels are
they that most vse, & need
this couer. Now for this fellow,
if thou findest him, puritā
is too good a name for
him; for the Scripture hath
sharper names, as, generation
of Vipers, Wolues in
Sheepes clothing, and painted
Sepulchers full of rotten
bones. These bee
they, whereon the diuell
sets the one foote, when

he kickes at true Christians
with the other, iustifying
by these, his railings on
those who especially hate
these, as the diuels chiefest
seruants. But now there
needs some discretion to
know these from the other,
that thou call not good euill,
nor euill good; nor a
Christian Hypocrite, nor
an Hypocrite, Christiā. Toward
this thou must looke
to the fruites of both, and
that not a few particulars,
but to the generall. For a
Godly man is subiect to infirmitie,
& hath some fals;
and an Hypocrite knowes
that to couer his wickednesse
hee must shew some
goodnes. But looke to the
continuall course of both,

and thou shalt finde, one
good generally, though
sometimes fraile; and the other
often grosly transgressing,
though much couering
his rotten heart. The
things wherein especially
thou shalt try the difference,
may be these. First a
loue to Christ: secondly, a
loue of Christs voice: thirdly,
a loue of the members
of Christ, and a reioycing
in them who excell in vertue.
Now these things will
againe appeare if for the
loue of Christ, the loue of
his word, and the loue of
his members, a man be ordinarily
contented to lose
sinfull profits or pleasures,
and with the steward to
write 50. for an 100. This

is the touchstone of a Christian,
euen the taking vp of
the Crosse, forsaking all,
and following Christ. But
this the hypocrite cannot
abide, he serues Christ, that
Christ may serue him, to
get pleasure and profit by
him, not to lose by him.
            
            
               Part. 8.
               But now heere come in
the many stories, which
condemne these purer men
to bee guiltie against these
duties, and so to be hypocrites.
Yet runne not away
too fast with this neither,
but euen in the point of
hearing reports, take also
some discretion with you.
For against good men very
commonly, are bold and
confident slanders raised,

which by their stoutnesse
might seeme to bee truth it
selfe. But let not the wise
beleeue them before examination.
For most commonly
in the very telling of
them, will appeare a venom
and malice, the true issue of
the old Serpent: and vpon
farther triall, falshood and
lying, the naturall brother
of the former, and a truly
begotten sonne of the Accuser
of the Brethren. He
began the rule in Paradise,
and will continue euen to
the new Ierusalem; lie boldly,
for some of it will sticke
fast for euer. And how can
it be otherwise, since the lasinesse
of men is such, that
they will beleeue a report
at the first telling, rather

then trouble themselues
to examine and finde
out the truth, which onely
should be belieued; & withall
their maliciousnesse is
so great, that they are willing
and readie to receiue
euill reports, yea, they delight
in them. But the seruants
of Christ know, that
the last iudgement shall be
by words, and that a rash
and a bitter iudge shall,
though not rashly, yet seuerely
be iudged. Therefore
according to the Psalmist,
The good man is merciful,
and guideth his words with
discretion. He inclineth naturally
to beleeue good rather
then euill; yet auoiding
to condemne the iust,
hee also shunnes to iustifie

the wicked. Therefore that
his iudgement may bee
righteous, hee searcheth
both the matter how probable
it is in it selfe; and
next he examineth the re-reporters,
whether they bee
those, in whom the truth
dwelleth, and who themselues
haue a good report of
the truth; not being like
Pilate, ignorant, and yet to
learne what is truth. For it
is a kind of murther of our
neighbour in his name and
reputation (which is almost
as his life) both to beare
false witnes, and to receiue
false witnesse against him.
Lastly, a good man, if hee
may conueniently, will inquire
of the partie himselfe,
or of some of his acquaintance,

whether such things
haue beene done by him;
and if done, in what manner,
and vpon what occasion:
for many times the maner
of things wholly alters
the matter, and the matter
may be good, in the manner
in which it was done,
yet euill in the manner bestowed
on it by the reporter.
Againe, the thing being
true, yet the occasion
and cause may, though not
iustifie, yet excuse the fact;
for many euill deeds are
done by infirmitie, which
yet prooue not the men euill
that did them. It were
pittie that men should go
to work this way with Dauid,
and onely iudge of him
by his murder and adulterie:

but it rather becomvs,
to see whether his course
of life being different from
his fact, do not manifestly
prooue, that these sinnes
were of infirmitie; of sinne
cleauing to him, not reigning
in sinne. And in this
point should euery man be
the milder; for as it is said
commonly in other matters,
it is euery mans cause;
this mans to day, and thine
to morrow. And though
thou sweare with Peter, that
if al the world deny Christ,
thou wilt not denie him,
yet I wil neuer beleeue thee
no more then Christ did
Peter; for in many things
we sinne all, and as the Apostles
said, We are also men,
subiect to the same infirmities.
               
            
            
               
               Part 9.
               But if these cautions wil
not yet moderate the sauages
of this world, as indeed
a foole, though braied
in a mortar, will not grow
wise: Yet, O thou man of
God, whosoeuer thou art,
that sufferest for Christs
sake, binde this rebuke to
thine head for a crowne,
and reioice that thou art
such a one as the diuell and
his followers hate; for hee
cannot be but good, whom
the diuell hateth. Reioyce
when men speake all euill
of thee falsely, and know
thou art now a brother of
Christ and his Saints in tribulation,
and in the kingdome;
for if thou suffer with
him, thou shalt also bee glorified

with him. The spirit,
whose shame now thou
bearest, shall hereafter cause
thee to beare his glorie; and
the more shame for his
sake, the more glorie. So
shall these Balaams, whose
hearts are so ready to curse
the people of God, be the
very meanes to procure a
blessing vnto them. For so
many curses, so many blessings;
therfore if there were
no offēce to God, nor hurt
nor pittie to themselues, we
might well suffer them to
curse apace, for they curse
vs as fast to glorie.
            
            
               Part. 10.
               From Christs time, place
is approoued by truth, not
truth by place. Hee that
freed true worship from being

tied to Ierusalem, and
tied it to the seruice in spirit
which may be in all places,
gaue true religiō a large
scope, euen as large as the
world it selfe. Therefore Ierusalem
being broken vp,
and true worship being set
free into the whole world,
let not Rome seeke to captiue
her againe, and tie her
to the chaine thereof: for
they that worship in spirit
and truth, haue God pleased
with them, though such
worship bee in places, that
know not Rome to bee on
earth.
            
         
         
            74
            The Word of God is an
vndefiled Word, rightnes it
selfe; and therefore the most
perfect rule. Let therefore

sinfull men frame their
liues to it, not seeke, as many
doe, to frame it to their
liues, and so to sinne by the
authoritie of righteousnes.
And let fraile and falling
man, though many of them
thinke they be the Church,
not trie this VVord by
themselues, whether it bee
right or not, but by the
VVord trie whether they
bee right, euen the right
and true Church; which is
knowne by this, that they
heare Christs voice, and
walke according to this
rule of Christ: Galathians
6. 16.
         
         
            75
            Silly and foolish is the
pride, that any man takes
in his seruice toward God.

For first, the whole man
being from God, wee can
giue him out of man nothing
but his own. Againe,
the whole man being due
to God, there can returne
no good thing from man
to God, but what is his due.
Thirdly, it is Gods free
choise, that vouchsafeth to
vse thy seruice, who refuseth
the imploiment of many
men, excellent in naturall abilities.
Certainly, we haue
seene many such of great
hope turned into earth, before
any, or small vse of thē.
God Al-sufficient, who can
raise vp seruants of stones,
thus often sheweth, that
men haue need of God and
his choise, to doe him any
good seruice; but hee needeth

not them. Therefore
let vs rather thanke God,
then boast before him, if
he imploy vs in his seruice.
Let vs with humilitie readily
performe it, as to that
great Lord, who hath refused
infinite better, to be serued
by vs; and whom therefore
to serue is a happines &
priuiledge of ours frō him,
not a benefit of ours to him
         
         
            76
            Many seuerall women
were made for many seueral
men; if many had bin allotted
to one, there would
haue bin fewer of the masculine
sexe; for euen among
heardsmen, this rule is obserued.
But now there is a
kind of equality in number,
that euery one might haue

his mate diuidedly, without
diuiding with another. And
this which was indeed best
was first; for then there being
but one woman to one
man, the sin which is now
vnlawfull, was then vnpossible.
What bare necessitie
was to man by creation,
let necessarie obedience
vnto God bee to the children
of regeneration; whose
speciall vertue, is to auoide
the ill which may be done.
Surely as running after lust
beyond this one, is endlesse
in regard of satisfaction, so
hath it a bad end in regard
of retribution, euen tormented
old age, that it can
sinne no more, and eternall
death for hauing so much
sinned.
         
         
            
            77
            When a man is possessed
by any lust, be it of couetousnesse,
concupiscence or
the like, there is set vp an
image in him, though not a
grauen one, which is to him
a God. This image wholly
filleth his minde, to it he
committeth idolatry, for
he offereth his whole heart
in sacrifice to it; and if he
can obtaine the thing therin
represented, he accounteth
himselfe happy, as in
the obtaining of God. Such
an image was there in Ahab
of Naboths vineyard,
and such a one of Bathsheba
in Dauid. But let vs take
heede of this worship of images,
for it is but a vaine
shadow which steppeth into

to the place of God; It telleth
vs of happinesse, but it
selfe obtained goeth into
nothing, & robs vs of true
happinesse. Let vs rub out
therefore the print thereof
with prayer and holy meditations,
filling vp our
hearts with profitable and
eternall truthes, to keepe
out these dying and killing
vanities, let nothing posses
our hearts but God himselfe,
who will one day glorifie
the place wherein he
dwels, and make it looke
like a temple of God: And
surely nothing but God is
worthy of a man.
         
         
            78
            God is the cause of all
vnder-causes and of all effects;
in him is the fulnesse

of all things, the spring of
all beings. This world is a
determinate measure of his
effects. The naturall life at
the best is but a certaine
number of these effects, during
a certaine peece and limit
of time. But the spirituall
life caused by our vnion
with God, is an euerlasting
and infinite enioying of
the infinite cause of all
things. Hereby shall wee
finde the Christian to bee
most perfectly happie, who
possesseth all things in their
cause, and beyond al things
that are, shall enioy the
cause it selfe. Infinite is the
difference betweene wisedome
the cause, and wisedome
the effect; light the
cause, and light the effect;

loue the cause, loue the effect.
Therefore is earthly
Paradise wiped out, and the
Sunne shall be taken away,
and worldly pleasure eaten
vp by death. And from
hence haue wee infinite cō
               fort,
for besides the blessed
end which comforteth all
labours, wee haue other
comforts in our way thither.
For if some temporall
effects of God be now wanting,
yet in God they are
ready for vs, and farre more
excellent things, when it
shall be best for vs: for God
hauing cōmunicated himselfe
to vs, we may certainly
beleeue, he cannot denie
things small in comparison
of him, when they shall be
for our good. Therefore

when he withholds them,
hee doth it as not beeing
good for vs: yea we may reioyce
in griefe, knowing
that a louing God and our
God is the very cause of it,
and that to our good. So
while our flesh by nature is
sad at the effect, our heart
by grace may reioyce confidently
in the cause. For
God vnchāgeable, through
all our changes aymeth vnchangeably
to this end, our
good. Let all seeke God
with their whole heart;
since himselfe is our exceeding
great reward; since all
things attend vpon him
ready to cast themselues
vpon them whom they see
fauored by him: And since
all things of what time soeuer

that are cast on vs, are
turned into good by him
who dwelleth in vs.
         
         
            79
            If a good name be better
then a small parcell of
goods, then he that sits as
iudge of a mans good name
ought to proceede to sentence
vpon as firme euidence,
as the iudge of a
mans goods. If this were
obserued, men would heare
sufficient witnesses before
they fall to their censures:
Surely it is a great fault of
these times, that men are
sooner condemned to bee
wholly naught, then a publikely
accused-man, is to
haue stollen a sheepe. The
reason hereof is; There is a
drop of the great Serpents

venome powred into our
hearts, which breeds in vs a
willingnesse to heare euill
of our neighbours. But let
vs thirst for the medicinable
drops of grace, & sucke
thē into our hearts, which
will fill vs with that loue
which reioyceth not in euill.
It is a pitiful thing that
creatures of one forme, of
one condition, should delight
in the blemishes and
miseries of each other. But
when the diuell brought vs
to fall out with God, he also
brought vs to fall out among
our selues, that loue
the fulfilling of the Law
might be perfectly broken.
Yet they that are new made
by Christ, must learne
Christs new commandement,

which is loue, and
be slowly and vnwillingly
led to beleeue euill of their
neighbour.
         
         
            80
            It is a good degree of
happinesse to haue a nature
inclining, yea in different to
those waies to which the
spirit bends it selfe, and
would bend it. Thence it
seemes a great aduantage
when a man hath in his nature
a coldnesse to Ambition,
to the glory of this
world, to the pleasures of
the world, and when it
draweth, and contracteth
it selfe into a narrower content,
being satisfied euen
with things necessarie. For
if we haue not this naturally
in vs, we must striue to

make it naturall by custome,
because there is an
absolute necessity that wee
be such, or still striue to bee
such. For God must reigne
in vs if we will reigne with
him; & how doth he reigne
in vs, but by moderating
& guiding the minde within
the compasse of reason,
curbing and restraining
wilde and inordinate affections?
And this it seemes
is much the end of afflictions
on the men whom God
loues, that there by taming,
swaging, and cooling their
nature, and as it were washing
and taking away by a
priuation, the head-strong
affections which it beareth
to the world; the spirit
may vnresisted enter in, and

quietly worke his nature
into the afflicted. And as
for these naturall vertues,
though they bee not Christian,
nor in themselues acceptable
to God, while
they are meerely mooued
by nature, to a naturall
mans ends; yet when nature
is mooued to do them
by the spirit, from a right
cause which is the loue of
God, vnto the right end
which is the glory of God;
then the actions so done
by the seruice of nature, are
good & acceptable to God.
As for those whose crooked,
and more vnmannagable
nature, standeth stiffe
against the discipline of the
spirit and their owne desires;
let them not therefore

despaire, because their euill
ground bringeth forth lesse
fruite, & more bryers then
the others. It pleaseth God
indeed to make thee one of
those to whom he appointeth
more labour, for the
promised penny; yet be not
wearie of well doing, for if
thou faint not, thou shalt in
due time receiue thy wages.
If thou striue heartily
against thy euill and hate it,
God is pleased with thy
will and affection, as much
as the others action. Therfore
striue hopefully, according
to the might which
thou hast, praying for more;
and his grace is sufficient
for thee.
         
         
            81
            The wisedome of man

and the wisedome of God
are exceeding different, and
no maruaile: one being infinitely
pure, and purely infinite;
the other narrow, but
great in corruption. As in
all things therefore wee
should forsake our owne
wisedome, and leane vnto
Gods; so not with the least
care in the matter of reuenge;
when thou hast suffered
some euill, thine own
wisedome bids thee returne
euill to the doer, but
the wisedome of God bids
thee to returne him good
notwithstanding this euill.
Hereat thou wondrest, and
thy flesh finds no wisdome
in this to returne good for
euill, to helpe him who
hurts thee: yet is the counsell

of thy wisedom, indeed
folly, & this of Gods, excellently
wise. For 1. in reuenging
thy self, thou dost foolishly;
for God hauing taken
to him self alone, the name
& power of being iudge of
the world, thou steppest into
this place and wilt bee
thy owne iudge. And God
hauing delegated part of
this power for a time vnto
Magistrates, thou intrudest
into their place, and so art
Rebellious both against
God and man. And indeed,
as thou hast made thy
selfe a iudge, so thou makest
thy selfe an executioner,
and art the hangman to execute
the sentence of thy
own malice: surely if a man
had robbed thee though

with some blowes, and were
apprehended and condemned
by the Magistrate, thou
wouldest take it a great disgrace
to be appointed for a
hangman, or executioner
of him, who thus offendeth
thee; yet heere is nothing
but iustice: but when thine
owne wrath vsurping the
place of Iudgement, condemnes
a man for a blow
or a word to die, then it is a
part of honour, to bee the
executioner of thy own vniust
and vnlawful sentence.
Be not deceiued, this latter
is the worse hangman of
the two. But to examine
thy folly neerer, how art
thou indeede auenged by
this, which thou thinkest
and callest reuenge? By intruding

into Gods office,
thou hast taken the matter
out of Gods hands into
thine owne: but so where
before a God, and an offended
God was thy enemies
Iudge, who in his
wrath could cast both soule
and bodie into hell fire;
now a man hath vndertaken
him, who hath onely
power on the bodie, if yet
he haue so much: so instead
of a reuenger, thou hast
done the part of a redeemer,
and goest about to helpe
him, whom thou thoughtest
to hurt. Againe, where
God was before angry with
him alone, now he is angrie
with thee also, and so hast
thou lost thy aduantage,
which thou hadst vpon

him. Thou hadst the best
friend in the world for thee,
and against him: and now
thou hast by thy reuenge,
lost him equally with the
other. And lastly, him
whom thou censurest to
haue done euill, thou goest
about to imitate, and to
make thy selfe as bad as he.
And now that Gods counsell
to recompense good for
euill, is excellently wise, it
appeares hereby: certaine it
is, and to the godly certainly
knowne, that the eies of
God behold al things done
on earth; and he which beholdeth
all things certainly,
shall as certainely iudge
all men, for all things done
in their flesh. Therefore if a
man wrong thee, know that

this wrong is seene, that it
is recorded, that it shall bee
iudged. And if thou couldest
now but see, or rightly
imagine that terrible
iudgement, which shall bee
inflicted on those which
touch Gods anointed, thou
wouldest pitty them, whom
now thy vengeance would
punish. Surely fire and
brimstone, cries and torments,
darknesse and diuels
are their portion;
though it bee not present,
yet it shall be present, and
the weight of the paine shal
recompence the stay. Again,
the moore good thou art,
the more God will pitty
thee, the more God will
plague him that wrongeth
thee. For the more good,

the dearer to God, and the
more odious are those that
offend thee. Therefore if
thou wilt bee reuenged on
thy enemie, bee still doing
of good as to all, so to him
among all; and thy goodnesse
shall bring God the auenger
vpon him, and shall
heape coales of fire vpon
his head, in the day of the
highest vengeance. Possesse
thy soule in goodnesse,
in patience, and
bee not mooued from thy
place to doe euill; then shalt
thou dwel assuredly in happinesse,
and shalt see thy
desire vpon thy enemies;
whatsoeuer the wicked do,
thou knowest thy part;
though he doth the works
of a wicked man, thou still

art to bring forth the fruits
of a good man; hee doth
what belongs to a seruant
of his master: do thou what
belongs to the seruice of
thine, and at last thou shalt
see his Lord and himselfe
made the foote stoole of thy
Lord, and cast downe into
vtter darkenesse, where shal
be weeping and gnashing
of teeth. Then shall this
thy Lord, who casteth him
into hell, exalt thee into
heauen: and as your waies in
this life were diuers, so shall
they bee in the next; and
then shall it be no griefe of
mind to thee, when thou
art in that glorious kingdome,
that thy hand hath
not shed blood, nor wickedly
auenged thy wrongs.
         
         
            
            82
            The nature of man by
the corruption thereof maketh
a God of whatsoeuer
it listeth. Therefore rightly
is Idolatrie by the Apostle,
reckoned among the works
of the flesh, it being a work
to which the flesh is prone.
This hath the wicked custome
of mankind grossely
declared, while some make
their wealth a god; some
haue taken men for gods,
as the Barbarians did Paul
and Barnabas: and some
haue made gods for all occasions,
as did the Romans.
But among the rest, this
corruption of the flesh, hath
a speciall lust and desire of
some glorious and faire
image, to make to it selfe a

God. And this it doth not,
by beleeuing the outward
substance, as gold or wood,
to be a God of it selfe, but
that some diuine spirit inhabiteth
and possesseth it,
and so maketh it diuine
by dwelling in it. This
inclination and readinesse
of man to idolatrie is expressed
often in Scripture
Ieremie 10. Ezechiel 16.
Iudges 2. Yea, it hath so
farre preuailed, that men
haue beene inflamed with
Idols, vnder euerie greene
tree, burning in lust toward
them; yea they haue
adored and worshipped
the very images of their
friends which they kept
as remembrances of them,
Wisd. 13. 10. and more particularly,

the image of the
serpent which healed them,
2. King. 18. If this was the
inclination of mans nature
in former times, how can
wee but still looke for the
same fruites of the same
roote? The same corrupt
nature, yea worse in these
last times still dwelleth in
vs; it is as neere kin to Idols
as euer it was, and the
diuell rageth more then euer
hee did, knowing his
time to be short. Therefore
if an image was a stumbling
blocke, and a teacher of
lies, how do they teach the
truth, that teach images?
Where they are publikely
proposed vnto corrupt
and fraile mankinde, yea
where they are proposed to

be worshipped with the honour
due to the patterne,
yea where they doe or are
said to do great and diuine
wonders, what can be looked
for, but that the same
mankinde which worshipped
images in old time, and
by that worship were idolaters,
will worship images
with the same worship
now, and now also become
idolaters? The same man,
the same image, and the
same idolatry. But now
they are taught not to worship
them with diuine worship.
And then they were
taught by the second commandement,
not to worship
them at all. Thy proposing
of them doth draw
men more to them, then

thy teaching doth deterre
from them. Say what thou
wilt, if thou put an image
before a man of flesh. Flesh
and the image will together
commit idolatry. Wilt
thou take thy faire wife, and
leaue her with a lustfull
man, and tell him he shall
only passe the time with
her in ciuill conference.
The Lord of hosts, is as ielous
of his spouse, as thou
of thy wife; he wil not haue
temptations set before her,
and therefore forbids altogether
the making of images
for any worship. Besides
the ignorant man vnderstands
not the difference
betweene Dulia and Latria,
but falls heartily to his
businesse, and thinkes he

cannot do it amisse if he do
it with all his heart. And if
hee did vnderstand it, yet
when it doth miracles, how
can they not worship it?
since euen for that Israel
worshipped the serpent,
which their story told them
to haue beene made of
Brasse. Therefore let men
cease to lay stūbling blocks
before the blinde, though
they hang vp lanternes by
their sides. Let them not
ioyne with the diuell to
make temptations: yea let
them auoide euen images
of remembrances in the
place of worship, since such
haue drawne worship aside
from God vnto them: And
cursed is hee that maketh
the blinde to goe out of the

way. Deut. 27.
         
         
            83
            The estates and functions
in this world, considered
alone, and not in order
& respect to the next, meet
altogether at the end of life
in the same point of vanity,
howsoeuer by the way
different in the apparance
of outward glory. And in
this way, those that are gotten
aboue necessity and
miserie, haue so confused,
vnknowne, & mixt a goodnesse,
that they still turne
our thoughts forcibly from
themselues, and send them
beyond themselues vnto
another kinde of beeing, to
finde fulnesse and satisfaction.
The higher estate,
which is that of power and

action, pleaseth it selfe in
the preheminence thereof,
and beholding it selfe a
cause & moouer of effects.
But the end of a thing being
the excellency & crown
thereof, and the naturall
end of action, and motion
being rest, it seemes that
the lower estates enioying
this most, enioy most the
chiefest, and haue the aduantage
of the fruite, while
the other hath the commendation
of being an excellent
roote. Yet the greatest
are most contented to
be so, and the lesser might
be contented, but they will
not; and so is there a confusion
herein: that imagination
maketh some contented
with labour, while more

substantiall rest, will not satisfie
others. Besides this
vexation of minde, there is
another: That to be farre aboue
miserie, is a miserie:
and desires preuented, partake
much of the trouble of
desires vnsatisfied. For man
being made of lust, it is a
torment to him, not to
lust; and so while men hunt
after an excesse of fulnesse,
they hunt after their owne
torment: yet is there a great
path beaten by these runners
after extremities, who
know not the sweet bound
and point of enough, beyond
which, their striuing
is labour for losse. Againe,
the supposed excellency,
and highest perfection of
mankinde, being commonly

imagined to bee at the
state and ripenesse of manhood,
yet in that indeede is
man most miserable, as being
then lanched forth like
a full built ship into the
world, a sea of cares and
sorrowes; Then also knowledge
increased, increaseth
sorrow, giuing man a more
full taste of his owne miserie.
But youth is free from
care, and hath strong enioyings
of smal & easie things;
for youth couers all things
with its own pleasantnesse,
whereas age is sad in spite
of obiects, colouring them
also with it owne deadnes:
Yet youth desireth manhood,
and is tormented for
lacke of it, and after is punished
with hauing it. If

then the ripenesse of man,
euen mans best, is a station
of care; if he grow from
pleasure as he groweth into
manhood, and yet tendeth
vnto manhood as vnto his
perfection; it seemes the
very being and perfection
of man is a beeing of care
and trouble, and that man
is verily borne to labour as
the sparkes flie vpward.
Now what is there left to
be thought of man? but
that he was not made only
for vanitie and miserie, and
that this miserie hath a farther
and a better end, euen
happinesse it selfe. We are
here brought into a state of
trouble, and straitnesse, but
it is, that seruing God first
in labour, we should after

come to his rest; and that
the consideration of this
rest should be our comfort
in the time of our labour.
Let vs therefore worke on
strongly in the worke of
God imposed vpon vs,
knowing that after the sixe
daies labour, commeth rest
of the seauenth. And let our
eyes be continually on the
ioyes which follow, and
not on the paine which is
present: the ioyes beheld
must needs incourage vs,
for their sight is comfortable,
and especially because
wee are sure they are ours.
The paine neglected and
vnregarded, cannot be very
discōfortable; the thought
not beeing grieued with
that which is not beheld

by it. Thus did Christ
looke stedfastly on glorie,
and so despised the shame,
and endured the crosse; and
so doth God himselfe, in
the sufferings of his seruants.
The world indeede
wonders who sees but halfe
of the matter, when it beholds
the sufferings of iust
and holy men. They wonder
that God takes no more
pitty on them, but suffers
the fire, the axe, and the
tormenter to haue power
ouer them. But then God
who beholds at once the
whole estate of a Christian,
sees both the torments present,
and the glory following;
and hee iudgeth the
short and finite torments to
be the gaine & aduantage

of his seruants, since they
cause a great accesse of infinite
glory. Therefore let
vs be so minded as God and
his Christ are, and walke
on valiantly in sanctified
miserie vnto true felicitie.
         
         
            84
            Most men in part, or in
whole are Gadarens, or
Capernaites. The Gadaren,
if hee lose any thing by
Christ, desires him to depart
out of his coasts, and will
lose Christ, rather then his
swine. The Capernaite followes
Christ, but it is to be
filled; so he seekes Christ
for his belly, and makes his
belly the ende of Christ.
These things are too vsuall
among vs, wee are readie

to shrinke from Christ,
as soone as our profits or
pleasures shrinke from vs;
because of Christ, wee will
not be saued our selues, except
wee may haue euerie
thing else safe aswell as our
selues: we will bee both Diues
and Lazarus, wee will
haue happinesse both here
and hereafter, which may
not bee: for this is to knit
together, what God hath
parted asunder. Equally
wicked is their purpose,
that intend▪ to make an
occupation of Christ to get
fauour, riches, or preferment
by him; that turne
Christ from his, of being
a Sauiour, and vse
him as Merchandize: who
take the ladder of Iacob,
               
by which wee should ascend
into heauen, and
peruerting the vse of it,
thereby clime downeward
to the things of this earth.
But miserable and foolish
man, thou both robbest &
destroiest thy selfe with this
thy policie. Christ would
haue done farre greater
things for thee, and thou
wilt onely haue him helpe
thee to the lesse: he would
haue giuen thee an euerlasting
Kingdome, a Treasure
that is farre aboue theeues
and rust; but thou hadst rather
receiue lesse and worse
things from him, transitory
honour, and rustie treasure.
Thou art a child in vnderstanding;
thou takest an
apple, and refusest a iewell:

But he that is verily Christs
Disciple, auoids these corruptions.
He knowes Christ
to bee such an inestimable
Pearle and happinesse, that
if hee haue Christ, though
with the losse of father or
mother, wife or children,
life or land, yea, with persecutions;
yet the possession
of him yeelds a hundred
fold more comfort in this
life, and in the life to come
eternall felicitie. He is still
a gainer amid all his losses,
yea he gaines by his losses;
for losses for Christ gaine
great comfort and assurance
in this world, that the
losers are accounted worthie
to lose any thing for
Christ; and hereafter in the
next world, shall they gaine

an exceeding reward of
glorie. The same Disciple
also out of the same estimation
of Christ, highly disdaineth
to make any other
end of Christ, but Christ
himselfe. Yea hee so highly
preferreth Christ aboue
all things, that he accounts
all things dung, so he may
win Christ; Christ is the
marke of his desires, hee
sees nothing beyond him,
but all things farre short of
him: He knowes Christ to
be infinitely better then all
things, and therefore vseth
the worse as helpes to the
better; but farre it is from
him, to propose the better
only as a meanes vnto
the worse. So he passeth
through all other things as

a Pilgrime, but takes vp his
rest in Christ alone. He
walkes along treading on
earth, and earthly things,
with his eies and heart fixed
on his Sauiour in heauen:
To conclude, he is so
farre from selling Christ, to
get any thing, yt
                he will sell
al things to obtaine Christ:
Now true loue, the fruite of
a true faith, makes this
yoke easie, and this commandement
light.
         
         
            85
            The naturall man hath
in him an inclination to be
proud in the enioying of
such things as haue any excellence,
though himself be
not the Author of that excellence,
and sometimes
though he haue therby no

addition of worth to his
owne person. So in the first
kinde he is proud of a good
wit, and in the second, is
he proud of a proud horse,
of a rich iewell, of an imbrodered
garment. And accordingly
hee attributeth
more glory to himselfe, for
possessing them, then to
the Author and giuer, for
creating and giuing them:
yea commonly all the glory
to himselfe, the standing
poole, and none to the
spring. But the true Christian,
euen the new borne
sonne of God, rips vp this
swelling deceit, and striues
to free his soule from it, and
to bring her to a true and
iust discerning of things.
To this end bending her

eye to the contemplation
of truth, shee findes that
chiefe and only glory belongeth
to the giuer, not to
the receiuer; to the Creator,
not to the thing made.
Shee sees no reason that she
should boast of anothers
worke, nor that shee should
be proud of what shee hath
receiued; but rather shee
seeth great reason, that the
creature should giue all glory
to the Creator, and the
receiuer to the giuer. For
the borrower is a seruant
to the lender, his receiuing
is an implied subiection,
and hee oweth to him the
thing lent, much more the
glory of the thing. Accordingly▪
the sanctified cry
out: Sing ye loud to the

Lord all the earth; for the
Lord is God, he hath made
vs, and not wee our selues:
And, Thou art worthie ô
Lord to receiue glory, honour,
and power, for thou
hast created all things. This
if puft vp man would rightly
consider, hee would remember
by the benefits of
God, to glorifie God his
Benefactor, not himselfe,
the almesman of God. And
thogh knowledge by mans
corruption is made an instrument
of puffing vp, yet
knowledge pursued to this
point by sanctification,
would humble and abase.
For it would shew vs that
wee must glorie in our
owne, not in our debts. Rather
thereby as borrowers

and owners wee should become
humble acknowledgers
of our owne subiection
and obligation to him
who lendes and bestowes.
But miserable and distracted
man, how farre dost
thou wander from this dutie?
thou art proud of a
chaine borrowed of thy
neighbour, howmuch more
wilt thou bee of a greater
thing giuen thee of thy
God? Rather breake off thy
sins by repentance, humble
thy false swelling, & abate
the wisedome of thy foolish
flesh; yea let all glorie
which other giue thee, reflect
from thee to thy maker,
who only is the true
rest of glory. Then if thou
glorifie him, thou shalt be

glorified by him, wc
                is the
glory thou especially shouldest
seeke for vnto thy self;
so maist thou aspire by humility
which is the only honour:
yea most ready way
of aspiring. But if thou doe
it not, know that pride is
the especiall barre of Gods
mercies; Pride keepes out
God, and many might haue
beene farre more sanctified,
if they had beene farre lesse
proud. For God enters not
into the soule that acknowledgeth
not him nor his benefits;
those that are farre
from beholding him, hee
beholdeth afar off. But into
the humble soule, that
giueth him abundance of
glory; he enters with abundance
of grace, sowing

there, and there only plenty
of grace, where he is assured
to reape plenty of glory.
Now let vs beware that
what God soweth for himselfe
wee reape not to our
selues, lest we be found robbers
of God: but being as
labourers in that haruest only
for him, let vs be content
with our wages of labouring,
which wil be sufficient
yea an exceeding great reward
to vs; for great glorie
shall be giuen to those in
the next world, to whom
God giueth grace to bee
humble in this world.
         
         
            86
            It is pittie we haue so
wholly taken vp our minds
with the controuersies, betweene
vs & the Pope, that
wee haue much neglected

the more immediate controuersie
between vs & the
diuell. It is good that thou
lay thy hand on this, and
forget not the other. The
chiefe superedification on
Faith is Loue, and this loue
tends to the fulfilling of the
commandements. Herein
are the children of God
knowne, and the children
of Satan. Hee that loueth
is borne of God, and
he that loueth not, hath
not seene God, but the
wrath of God abideth on
him. But as loue must bee
had, so must it be had to
some purpose, it must bee
vseful, & bring forth the naturall
& kindly fruite thereof,
which is keeping the
commandements. But the

blacknesse of darkenesse is
so thicke on the soule of
man by his fall, that he cannot
see the good which he
would doe; and hence it is,
that often loue brings the
children of good workes to
the birth, but there is no
strength of knowledge to
deliuer them. Many there
are who haue consciences
great with charitie, yet in
many things for want of
knowledge, they either abstaine
from doing at all, because
they know not what
is right to be done, or somtimes
mistake euill for
good, and so offend God instead
of pleasing him. Now
lamentable it is to see zeale
and deuotion mispent, to
see a good minde bring

forth euill fruits, & the holy
but diuine soule to goe
cleane contrary to yt
                way it
purposeth. And this thogh
neglected, very much abateth
ye
                glorie & prosperitie
of the light, and enlargeth
the power and limits of the
kingdome of darkenesse.
And as much darkenesse as
is left, so much roome is
there left for Satā, so much
territory is there allowed
to him; which as we should
striue wholly to gaine from
him, so especially in those
which belong not to him,
but haue giuen themselues
to the God of light, to
walke as children of the
light. Be it therefore the
precious & worthy labour
of some Bezaleel or Aholiab,
               
some one whose heart God
hath touched and inlightned,
to lighten and kindle
many of the yet-dim-shining
lampes which are in
the house of God. Let them
be eies to the blinde, and
let them ioyne with the spirit
of God, saying in the
voice thereof, This is the
way, walke in it. Let them
breake abroad the commandements
of God into
their seuerall branches of
things forbidden, and commanded,
that he which runneth
may reade, and hee
which readeth, may runne
aright. Then shall many a
worke of darkenesse be preuented,
and the workes of
light shall spring in farre
greater aboundance. Then

shall the Prince of darknes
bee chased much farther
from vs, and the God of
light shall dwell more
powerfully and fully in vs.
Then shalt thou, whosouer
thou art, that turnest
a soule from sinning, shine
as the starres in heauen;
the blessing of him that
hath receiued instruction
from thee, shall bee vpon
thee, and thou shalt haue
an especiall part in that
welcome of Christ, in the
day of Christ: Come thou
blessed of my Father; for
when I was hungrie and
imprisoned in my mēbers,
pining for want of knowledge,
and fettered with ignorance,
thou didst enlarge
mee, thou didst feede

and increase me. But if the
spirituall lawyers shall not
be so diligent to search, and
set forth Cases of Conscience,
as the secular Lawyers
are to publish Cases of
transitorie and temporall
right, let them expect to
haue a chiefe part in that
curse of Christ: Woe be to
you Lawyers, for ye withhold
the key of knowledge,
ye either enter not your
selues, or you do not helpe
those that would, to enter.
         
         
            87
            The man who intends
deseruedly to get the name
of a Christian, hath vndertaken
a worke called mortification,
a denying of vngodly
lusts, euen a dying to
sin, that he may liue in the

spirit of Christ. He that purposeth
the end, must likewise
intend the meanes, els
his purpose is not effectual,
and is not indeed a purpose
of the end. Now if hee seriously
intend to vse the
meanes, a speciall part of
that meanes will bee a true
search and notice of the
lustes which he must denie,
and chiefly of the chiefest;
which excell in force, or in
height of corruption. For
this must he looke into the
nature of man in generall,
into the nature of the men
of that countrie or place
where he dwelles, and into
the custome (which is also
a nature) of men at that
time when he liues, and especially
into the mā, which

is himself. This being done,
let him take the rule of the
law, & lay it on mā thus distinctly
cōsidered; & he shal
find both wherein lust hath
bowed mankind in general
from that rule, & wherein eminently
& especially men
of that country men of that
time, and wherein his owne
hart. And this being found,
he hath then his worke before
him, he sees what hee
must generally denie, and
what parts of the generall
with his chiefest strength
he must resist; and what he
thinkes fit to resist himself,
let him also prouoke others,
to resist the same. If wee
make not this search at all,
lust may come to our harts
not known to be lust, but in

the shape of righteousnes, or
at least, couered by custome
frō appearing to be vnrighteousnes,
and so may be admitted.
If wee make this
search, and that but general,
we may indeed find al vices
and so may bee mooued to
make a general resistance to
al. But yet if we make not a
different resistance, that is,
more setled & strong against
the stronger, (such as are
those of our nation, time &
person) by not matching
them, wee our selues are ouermatched,
and so ouer
maistered. This knowledge
as it is in it selfe necessarie,
so it may be knowne to be
such, because our mercifull
God, by a long succession
of Prophets, taught and imparted

it to man. Hee sent
early and late his faithfull
messengers to tell Iacob his
sinnes, and Israel his transgressions,
to disswade the
wicked that he turne from
his wickednesse, and liue.
And as those Watchmen of
God, marked the accesse
and inroade of sinnes, to
giue warning both to thē
               selues
and others, that they
should not perish in the deluge
of vices; so should
there be a perpetuall watch
kept by the Saints and seruants
of God, ouer themselues
and others, that they
may not bee ignorant of
Satans policies; that the
Foxes bee taken betimes,
which destroy the Vineyard;
and that all leauen of

errours or maliciousnesse
may be purged, as soone as
mixed. And indeed what
worke doth more profitablie
imploy the skilful master-builders
and edifiers,
then the finding and repairing
of the ruines of the Citie
of God? That is building
indeede, to bring a
stone into a decaied place,
not to fill vp that which is
already full. That is most
properly fortifying, which
giues strength, to the place
that needeth it, not to that
which is alreadie safe.
wherefore let both Prophets
and people labour herein,
vntill time shal be no more,
that the breaches of Ierusalem
may bee both found
and repaired; that the enemie

bee kept out at his places
of aduantage, that Satan
may haue no new engin,
but that there may be
a defence readie against it;
vntill our Lord Iesus, the
founder and foundation of
his Church appeare. Who
now building by the Ministerie
of his Prophets, will
then commend and exalt
those that haue been the
wise and faithfull builders,
and will lift vp the whole
Citie once perfectly built
into the safetie and blessednesse
of his owne presence,
for euer and euer.
            The Spirit and the Bride say,
Come, euen so, come Lord
Iesus.
