As it hath pleased the lord, so it is come to passe, now blessed be the the name of the Lord. Oh it is for my great profyt, that the lord hath thus visited me, euen yt I shulde learne to forsake myne own wyl, and to walcke in hys holye ordynaunces. I am his creature, & a shepe of his pasture, let him deale wyth me, as semeth good in hys godly syghte. For whyther I liue or dye, I am the Lordes. Hys wil therfore be done and not myne. Gyue hym grace (O swete Iesu) thus to be perswaded of thy good wyll towarde hym euen in the myddes of hys moost bytter agonyes, that he faynt not vnder the crosse, but paciently and thanckefully

abyde thy good plesure, and wyth earnest fayth cal on thy blessed name, which is a strong tower for all them that fle vnto it.

               But if thy godly pleasure haue otherwyse determyned, that by thys hys sycknes thou wylte call hym from this vale of miseri and place hym in thy gloryous kyngdome, which alone is the true, ioyful and greatly longed for contre of al thy chosen and faythful people: we most entierly pray the in ye meane whyle to geue hym grace paciently and thankfully to beare hys crosse, diligently to cal on thy holy name, valeauntly to fight agaynst al the tentacions of the deuyll, the flesh and the worlde, and faithfullye to beleue, that the merits of thi blessed passiō & precious

the and saye: O Lorde, I commende my soule into thy hādes. Lorde Iesu take my spirite vnto thee. Graunt also most louyng Lord that when death hath shut vp the eyes of his bodye, he maye wyth the eyes of hys soule, beholde and looke vpon thy gloryous maiestye in thy heauenlye kyngdome, where thou wyth the father and the holy Ghoste lyuest and reignest one true and euerlasting God in al honour and glory worldes wythout ende.
