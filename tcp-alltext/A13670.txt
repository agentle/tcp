                  WHo ſo folo with me ſaith criſt our ſauiour walketh nat ī derkenes: Theſe be the wordes of ieſucriſt wherby we be exorted to folow his lore & doctrine if we will truely be lightned & auoided from all blīnes of ignoraūce of mynde. Let our full affeccion be to haue our ſtudy & meditacion ī y• doctrine & lyfe of ieſucriſt whiche excelleth the doctrine of all ſeyntes. And who ſo may haue the iey of theyr ſoule ſequeſtrate in wordly thynges in this ſcripture of our lorde may fynde ſwere manna ſpiritual fode of the ſoule. But there be many oft tymes herīge the worde of god that hath litell ſwetnes or deuocion therin for their inwarde affeccyons & deſyres be rather of bodyly thynges than of goſtly. Therfore if we wyll haue true & perfyte vnderſtandynge of y• wordes of god we muſt dylygently ſtudye to conforme our lyfe to hys preceptis. what auaylethe a man to haue ſubtyll reaſons or argumentys of the Trinite? curious & ſubtyll reaſons garniſſed with elygance maketh nat a man holy: but obedyence and vertuous lyfe maketh a man dere to god. It is more expedyent to fele the inly compunccion of here than to know the diffinycion therof. If a man haue the knowledge of all ſcripture: alſo the ſeyiges of all philoſophers withoute grace and charite auayleth nat. For all thynge that is in thys worlde is vanyte

excepte the loue of god: & his ſeruyce or to this ende ordred. The moſte excellent wyſdome in any creature is by comtempte of this mutable & tranſetorye worlde to promote them ſelfe to the worlde ꝑdurable. it is vanite to labour inordinatly for coruptible cyches: tranſetorious honours: falſe & fleſſhely delites: or to deſire any inordinate pleſure temporall yt ſhall brynge a man to perpetuall pryne.

               ¶ The ſeconde Chaptre of the humble knowelege of mannesſelfe.
               EVery man naturally deſireth to haue knowlege. But what auaileth ſcience withoute the drede of god a pore homely laborynge man dredīge god is more acceptable in his feythe / than a curyous Philoſopher that labore the more to knowe the mo

& cōſidereth himſelfe & vnderſtādeth his owne wiſdome hath lytell delite in the vayne laude of the worlde. If man had knowlege of all thynges in the worlde without charite what ſhulde it auayle hym in the ſyght of god that iugeth man after his dedes Refrayne thyn appetite of īordinate deſire of curyous knowlege of thoſe thynges that rather ſhal diſeaſe thy ſoule & withdrawe it from the vnyte & charyte of god / than excyte it therto. As weſe many of this maner of / lerned men deſire to be reputed and holden wyſe in multiplyinge wordes which if they delyte the herynge / they refreſſhe & fede nat ye ſoule but litell. But a good life & pure cōſciēce refreſſheth the mynde & enduceth man to haue ferme cōfidence in god. The more knowlege that man hath: & worketh nat conformable: the more ſhalbe his peyne at the day of dome: & therfore exalte nat thy ſelf of any craft or cunnynge. but rather fere that thou diſpleaſe nat god ī abuſion therof. Remēbre if thou knowe many thynges & excedeſt other in cunnīge yet conſider that there be many mothynges that thou arte ignoraunt of / & many that be more wytty & excellēt & cunnīge than thou: If thou wylt ꝓfitably knowe & lerne: deſire to be vnknowen: & of ſmale reputacion: This is the moſte expedient and profitable leſſon: the very knowlege & cōtempte of thyn owne ſelfe. It is a greate wiſdome & ꝑfeccion to haue of thy ſelfe lytell confidēce: and eſtymate well of other. If thou ſeyſt any perſons openly ſynne or commytt any greate cryme: yet thou ſhuldeſt nat iuge thyſelfe

               ¶ The .iii. Chaptre of the doctryne of truthe.
               THat perſone is happy whome truthe diligētly informeth nat by fygures or voyces faylynge but by inwarde inſpiracion. Oure opinion / & vnderſtandynge many tymes dſceyueth vs. what auayleth it vs for to labour byſely for the knowlege of thoſe thynges / whyche ſhall nouther helpe vs yf we knowe theym: ne diſauauntage vs if we therin be ignoraunt at the day of iugement. It ys greate foly to diſpice thynges profytable / and neceſſary / & to labour for thoſe thynges that be curious & dampnable. Bleſſed ys that perſone whome god techeth for in hym be all good thynges that man may wyll or deſyre. A good lorde: in thy gracious preſencelet other doctours and all other creatures kepe ſilence & thou only ſpeke to my ſoule: for the more man ys īoyned to hym in inwarde mekenes: the more he receyueth of ſpirituall lyght of grace. wherby he knowethe many ſecrete myſteries hyd from other people The pure ſimple & ſtable mynde is nat ouer come or febled / for it referreth euery labour to the honour of god & īforceth it ſelfe to ceſſe fro al other thī
                  ges that be nat in the ſyght of god acceptable: who reſiſteth and letteth a man more than his owne ſenſuall affeccion? we rede of many Emperours & cō

Thys ſhulde be our daylye datayle to ſtryue with oure ſelfe / and the more vyctoryes the ſoule hath of the bodye the more ſtronge it ys: and more apte to encreſe and to growe in grace. Euery perfeccyon in thys lyfe hath ſome perfeccion annxid to it. And there is no knowlege in thys worlde: but it is myxt with ſome derkeneſſe of ignoraunce. The humble knowelege of thy ſelfe ys more ſure wey to heuen / than the curious ī
                  quiſicion of ꝓfounde knowlege of thynges vn ꝓfytable: the ſcience of euery thīge well ordred is good but a clere conſcience & a good lyfe is moche better. And there be diuers that ſtudy rather for excellence of cunnynge than good lyuynge: therfore they fall in errour & brynge for the litell frute or none. O wolde god they wolde indeuour themſelfe as dylygently to auoyde vice & plant vertue in theyr ſowles / as they be to moue curious queſtions & multiply ſuꝑfluꝰ langage: than there ſhulde nat be ſo moche occaſion of ſine ſhewed to the people ne ſo moche dyſſolute lyuīge ī religion. At y• day of iugemēt it ſhall nat be laide to our charge what we haue red or lerned or how pleaſaūtly we haue lyued: but what we haue done & how religiouſly we haue lyued / where be now all y• royal poetes with theyr crafty cōucied poemes & elegant oratours with their oraciōs garniſſhed with eligancy: the philoſophers with theyr

pregnaunt reaſons & ſētences. Diuers of theſe maner of clerkes we haue knowen in our dayes nowe theyr curioſite is paſſed and other mē occupie their prebendes & promocions that they poſſed: If they were here nowe ageyne I ſuppoſe they wolde neuer labour ſo byſily for curioſite in knowlege ne tē
                  porall promocions. Nowe they had leuer thann all this worlde that theyr entēt had ben accordynge to the holy doctryne of ſcripture than the ſtudy had bē happy. O howe many in manere of euery ſtate periſſhith in this worlde by vayne glory that more deſire to pleaſe prynces & prelates & other patrons for a temporall promocion than truly & in wardly to ſerue god for the promocions eternall. Theſe deſire rather by pompe & pryde to be great in the worlde: thā by mekenes & charite to be in fauoure with god / & therfore they vaniſſh ī their thaughtis & deſires as the ſmoke that euer the more it aſcēdeth the more yt fadeth & faileth That perſone may be named great in grace that is incended wyth charite & is ꝑfytly obedient by humylyte contempnynge the inordinat deſire of preemynens or of dignite. And he ys prudent that reputeth all worldely pleaſures & goodes as vile dunge in compariſon of the celeſtial goodis whiche we ſhall haue in the perfite poſſeſſion of the loue of ieſu criſt. And y• ꝑſon is verely well thaught that euer inforceth hym ſelfe to forſake his own will and foloweth the wyll of god.
            
            
               ¶ The forthe Chaptre ys of credence in byleuynge.
               
                  IT is nat expedient ne wyſdom to beleue euery worde or inly mociō of our mynde: but we muſt conſider that it is accordynge to the ſcripture of god & in no wyſe contrary therto. But I lament for ſorowe the lyght & frayle diſpoſicion of the īperfite people that be ſwifte to beleue & ſpecially thoſe thynges that be the hurt of theyr owne ſoules / and the det̄ment of theyr neyghboure. But the wyſe / & perfyte men knowynge the fraylte of man more ꝓne to euyll than to good be nat ſo lyght to beleue euery worde that they here. It is great wiſdom and alſo diſcreſcion to be ſober in iugement & other delynge & nat to haue ouermoche confidence in our ꝓpre dedes ne to reherſe other thynges lyghtly belened & herde & euer to gyue hede to take councell of a wiſe & a well conſcience man & euer gladder to be inſtructe of a nother than to folowe thy ꝓpre intencyon or mynde. A good lyfe maketh the to be reputed wiſe in the ſyght of god & to haue in many thynges experience. Euer the more meke & obedient a mā be to god the more wiſe & quyete ſhall he be.

But thoſe goodes be of lytell certente euer in mouīge and they be poſſſſed euer with labour and feere. Therfore beholde the heuenly goodes that ſhalbe poſſeſſed with al pleaſure and neuer fade. The felicite of man ſtandeth nat in the habundaunce of wordly goodes: but it requireth thynges neceſſary for thys worlde. Euer ye more ſpirituall a man deſireth to be / the more byttnes he ꝑceyueth in this worlde & more clerely ꝑceyueth the fautes of our corruptible kynde. & therfore the prophite Dauid deſired of our lorde to be deliuered from all ſuche neceſſarie defautes that ī maner let men to come to ꝑfeccion.

And we be remyſſe & necligent nowe whan we be moſte mighty to labour. what ſhall we do whan we waxe dull in wytte & feble in bodye. O howe vnhappy be thoſe that repute them ſelfe ſure ceſſynge to labour ageynſt vyce as they were ſure ī good lyfe. & yet there is no token in maner of ꝑfeccion in their lyfe: & they that thinke themſelfe ꝑfite as I haue reherſyd it were expedient that they were ī
