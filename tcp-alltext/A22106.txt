                  Iohan Bale to the Chrysten readers.
                  
                     AMonge other mooste syngular offyces (dylygent reader) which the lord hath appointed to be done in the ernest sprete of Helyas, by the forerōners of hys lattre aperaunce, this is one verye specyall to be noted. They shall turne the hartes of their auncient elders into the chyldren. Mala. iiii. And the vnbeleuers of theyr tyme, to the wysdome of those ryghteouse fathers, as ded Iohan Baptyste afore hys fyrste commyng. Luce. i. That is (say the Bedas cap. lxviii. de temporum ratione) the fayth and feruent zele of the prophetes and Apostles shal they plant in their hartes,Bedes prophecy. whych shal in those dayes lyue and be among men conuersaunt, & than wyl breake fourth (sayth he as a verye true prophete) such horryble persecucyon, as wyl fyrst of all take from the worlde, those myghtye helyases by triumphaunt martyrdom, to the terryfyenge of other in the same faythe of whom some shal becom through that occasion,2. sortes. most gloryouse martyrs vnto

Christ also, & some very wycked Apostataes forsaking his lyuely doctrine. For by the seyd Bedas testymony in the begynnyng of the same chaptre, two most certayne sygnes shall we thā haue that the lattre iudgement daye is at hande. The returne of Israels remnaunt vnto theyr lord God,2. sygnes. and the horryble persecucion of Antichrist.
                  Conferre with this treated scripture and former prophecye of that vertuous man Bedas, the worldes alteracyon now, with the terrible turmoilynges of our tyme. And as in a mooste clere myrrour, ye shal well perceyue them at this present, to be in moost quick workynge. And as concernynge the Israelytes or Iewes,Israelytes. I haue bothe seane and knowne of them in Germanye, mooste faythfull Christen beleuers. Neyther is it in the prophecye (Osee. iii.) that they shoulde at that daye be all conuerted, no more than they were at Iohan Baptystes preachynge. Luce. i. For as Esaye reporteth, thoughe the posteryte of Iacob be as the see sande (innumerable) yet shall but a remnaunte of them conuerte than vnto theyr lorde God. Esaie x. And thoughe the Lorde hathe syfted that howse of Israell (as brused corne in a syffe) amonge all other nacyons,

Amos. ix. Yet shal not that remnaunt of theirs peryshe, but at that daye be saued,preachers, throughe the onelye electyon of grace, Romano. xi. Nowe concernynge the afore seyd foreronners, in this most wonderful change of the worlde before the latter ende therof. I thynke within thys realme of Englande, besydes other nacions abroade, the sprete of Helyas was not all a slepe in good Wyllam Tydall, Robarte Barnes,Tyndale. Barnes, & suche other more, whome Antychristes vyolence hathe sent hens in fyre to heauen, as Helyas went afore in the fyrye charet. iiii. Regum. ii.
                  These turned the hartes of the fathers into the chyldren, suche tyme as they toke from a greate nombre of oure nacyon, by theyr Godlye preachynges, and wrytynges, the corrupted beleue of the pope & his mastery workers (which were no fathers, but cruel robbers & destroyers. Ioā. x.) reducynge thē agayn to the true faithe of Abraham and Peter. Gene. xv. and Math. xvi. The pure beleue in Christes birthe and passion, which Adam and Noe sucked out of the first promes of God,The fathers. Iacob and Moses out of the seconde, Dauid and the prophetes, out of the thirde, and so fourthe the Apostles & fathers oute of the other

scriptures, so firmelye planted they in the consciences of manye, that no cruell kynde of deathe coulde auerte thē from it. As we haue for example their constaunt discyples, and now stronge witnesses of Iesus Christ,Martyrs. Iohan Lassels and Anne Askewe, with theyr other. ii. companions, verye gloryous martyrs afore God, what thoughe they be not so afore the wronge iudgynge eyes of the world whom the bloudye remnaunte of Antechrist put vnto mooste cruell deathe in Smythfelde at London, in the yeare of our lorde. M.D.XLVI. in Iulye.
                  Yf they be onely (as was Iohan Baptyst) great afore the Lorde by the holye scriptures allowaunce, which are strongelye adourned with the graces of hys sprete, as faythe, force, vnderstandynge wisdome, pacyence, loue, long sufferaunce and suche lyfe. I dare boldelye afferme these iiii. myghty wytnesses also to be the same, so well as ye martirs of the primatyue or Apostles churche.Christen martyrs. For so strongelye had these those vertues as they, and so boldelye obiected their bodyes to the deathe for the vndefyled Christen beleue, agaynst the malygnaūt Synagoge of Sathan, as euer ded they for no tyrannye admyttynge any create orBreade. corruptyble substaunce for theyr eternal

Math. xii. I wold but knowe of thē, what myracles were shewed whan Iohā Baptystes head was cut of in the preson?myracles. Marci. vi. and whan Iames the Apostle was byheaded at Hierusalem? Acto. xii. These. ii. were excellent afore God, what though they were but miserable wretches, light fellowes sedycyouse heretykes, busye knaues, & lowsye beggers in ye syght of noble king Herode and hys honorable counsell of prelates.

Sure I am that their wycked predecessours there presente, se it not. For they stopped theyr eares, whan he tolde them therof. Actoru. vii. Yf they yet bringe fourth the other hystoryes of Apostles and martyrs.Legendes I answere them, that all they are of no suche autorite, as these here afore. The popes

martyrs in dede, were moche fuller of myracles than euer were Christes, as hys selfe tolde vs they shulde be so. Mathey. xxiiii. Yet wrought fryre Forest, Iohā Fisher, & Thomas More no miracles,Forest. Fysher.

With that Erasmus ded also ad Huttenū.Writers. P. M. ad Basparem Agrippam, Albertus Pighius, Riuius, Fichardus, & a great sort more. And as for the holye mayd of kēt with Doctor Bocking, though they wrought great wonders by theyr lyfe, yet apered non at their deathes. Of hys owne chosen martyrs,Christen martirs. Christ loketh for non other myracle, but that onelye they perseuer faythfull to the ende. Mathe. x. And neuer denye his verite afore men Luce. xii.

The handelynges of her other iii. companyons, shall be shewed in other seuerall treatyses at layser. For the glorye and greate power of the lorde,Goddes power. so manifestlye aperynge in hys elect vessels, maye not nowe perysh at al handes & be vnthankefullye neglected but be spred the worlde ouer, as wele in Latyne as English, to the perpetuall in famye of so willfully cruel and spyghtfull tyrauntes.

In most terrible persecucions of the primatiue churche, were the examynacions & answers, tormentes and deathes of the constaunt martyrs written, and sente abroade all the whole worlde ouer, as testyfyeth Eusebius Cesariensis in his ecclesyastyck hystorye. Their coppyes haboūde yet euery where. Great slaughter & burnynge hath bene here in Englande for Iohan wycleues bokes,Iohan Wlcleues bokes. euer sens the yeare of our lorde. M. CCC. LXXXII. Yet haue not one of them throughlye perysheth. I haue at thys houre the tytles of a C. and XLIIII. of them, which are many more in nombre. For some of thē vndre one title comprehendeth ii. bokes, some iii. some iiii. Yea, one of them contayneth xii. I thinke not the contrary, but ere the worlde be at a full ende,Canonise God wyll so gloryfye that twentye tymes condempned heretyke, execrated, cursed, spitted, and spatled at, that al your popish writers before

hys tyme and after, wyll be reckned but vyle swyne heardes to hym, for the good fauer he bare to Chrystes holye Gospell. A very madnesse is it to stryue agaynst God, whā he wyll haue the longe hydden inyquytees knowne. As the godlye wyse man Gamaliel sayd. Acto. v.Gamaliel If this enterpryse that is now taken agaynst yow, be of God, ye shal neuer be able with all your tirannouse practyses to dyssolue it.
                  Now concernynge that blessed woman Anne Askewe,Anne Askewe. which latelye suffered the tyrannye of this world for right wisnesse sake. In Lyncolneshyre was she borne of a verye auncyent and noble stocke. Sir William Askewe a worthy knyght beynge her father. But no worthynesse in the fleshe, neyther yet anye worldlye noblenesse auaileth to god warde, afore whome is no acceptacyon of persone. Actorum x. Onlye is it faythe with his true loue and feare, which maketh vs the accepte,True nobylyte. noble and worthye chyldren vnto God. Ioan. i. Whereof by hys gyfte, she had wonderfull habundaunce. Soch a wone was she, as was Lydia the purple sellar,Lydia. whose harte the lorde opened by the godlye preachynge of Paule at Thiatira, Acto. xvi. For dylygent hede gaue she to his worde

whan it was ones taught wythoute supersticion, & would no lōgar be a false worshipper or ydolatour after the wicked scole of Antichrist. But became frō thens forth a true worshipper, worshipping her lorde God (whych is a sprete & not breade) in sprete & in veryte, accordinge to ye worde of his, Ioan. iiii. The Gospell of Christ bare she in her harte. as ded the holye mayde Cecilia,Cecilia. & neuer after ceased frō the study therof, nor frō godlye cōmunycacion & prayer tyll she was clerlie by most cruel tormentes, taken from thys wretched worlde.
                  By her do I here (dere fryndes in the Lord) as ded the faithfull Bretherne in Fraunce, at the cities of Lions and Vicuna by a lyke faythfull yonge woman called Blandina,Blandina Whyche was there put to deathe with. iii. myghtye companyons more amonge other (as thys was) for her Christē beleue, about the yeare of our lorde.

They wrote vnto their Bretherne in the landes of Asia & Phrygia verye farre of, her mightie stronge sufferinges for Christes faith, which the knewe nothing of afore, I write here vnto yow in Englād ye double processe of this noble woman, wherof ye are not ignoraunt,

for so moch as it was there so manyfestly done amonge yow. Coupled I haue these ii. examples togither, bycause I fynde them in so manye pointes agree Blandina was yonge and tender. So was Anne Askewe also.Anne Askewe. But that which was fraile of nature in thē both. Christ made most stronge by hys grace. Blandina had iii. ernest companions in Christ.Companions. Maturus Sanctes, and Attalus, so feruently faythfull as her selfe. So had Anne Askewe iii. fyre fellowes, a gentylman called Iohan Lassels her instructour, a preste, and a tayler called Iohan Adlam, men in Chrystes veryte vnto the ende most cōstaunt.Recāters. With Blā
                     dina were in preson, to the nombre of x. whych denyed the truthe and were clerelie forsakē of God for it. How manye fell frō Christ besydes Crome & Shaxton, whan Anne Askewe stode faste by hym, I am vncerteyne. But I counsell them, as saynte Iohan counselled the Laodycyanes, in the myserable estate they are now in, to hye them through tryed golde of Christ,Tryed Golde. least they perysh all togither. Apoca. iii. If they had not styll remayned in that chauncell,The chauncell. whome Christe commaunded Iohan in no wyse to measure, Apoc. ii. They had neuer so shamefullye blasphemed, lyke

as Bedas also toucheth in hys former prophecye.
                  Prompt was Blandina, and of most lustye corage,Corage. in renderynge her lyfe for the lyberte of her faythe. No lesse lyuelye and quyck was Anne Askewe in all her enprisoninges and tormētes. Great was the loue, Blandina had to Christ. No lesse was the loue of Anne Askewe. Blandina neuer faynted in torment.Rakced. No more ded Anne Askewe in sprete, whan she was so terrybly racked of the chaū
                     celler and Ryche, that the strynges of her armes and eyes were peryshed Blā
                     dina deryded the cruelte of the tyrauntes. So ded Anne Askewe the madnesse of the Byshoppes and their speche men Reade burnynge plates of yron and of brasse had Blandina put to her sydes.Burned. So had Anne Askewe the flamynge brā
                     des of fyre. Full of God and his veryte was Blandina. So was Anne Askewe to the verye ende. Christ wonderfullye tryumphed in Blandina. So ded he in Anne Askewe, whan she made no noyse on the racke, and so ernestlye afterwarde reioyced in him. Blandina was geuen fourth to wyld beastes to be deuoured.Beastes So was Anne Askewe to cruel Bisshoppes & prestes, whom Christ calleth rauenynge wolues, deuourers, and theues.

Mathe. vii. & Iohan, x. Blandina vpon the scaffolde boldelye reprehended the pagane prestes of theyr errour. So dyd Anne Askewe when she was fast tied to the stake, with stomack rebuked yt blasphemous apostata Shaxton with the Bishoppes and prestes generacyon,Shaxtō. for theyr manyfest mayntenaunce of ydolatrye.
                  Blandina at the stake shewed a vysage vnterryfyed. So ded Anne Askewe acountenaunce stowte, myghtye and ernest. Infatygable was the sprete of Blā
                     dina. So was the sprete of Anne Askew. The loue of Iesus Christ, the gift of the holy Ghost, and hope of the crowne of martirdome, greatlye mytygated the paine in Blandina. So ded those. iii worthy graces,Graces. the terrour of all tormentes in Anne Askewe. The stronge sprete of Christ gaue stomack to Blandina, both to laugh and daunce. The same mightye sprete (& not the popes desperate sprete) made Anne Askewe both to reioyce and synge in the preson.Sprete. So bolde was blandina (saythe Eusebius) that wyth a presumpciō of stomack she cōmoned with Christ vnsene. I suppose Anne Askewes lattre examinaciō, wyl shewe her, not to doo moche lesse. Gentyl was Blādina to the Christē beleuers,Hygh stomacke. & terryble

to their aduersatyes. So was Anne Askewe very lowlye to true teachers, but scorneful and hygh stomaked to the enemyes of truthe: Many were conuerted by the sufferaunce of Blandina. A farre greatter nombre by the burnynge of Anne Askewe. Though Blandina were yonge, yet was she called the mother of martyrs.Mother. Manye men haue supposed Anne Askewe, for her Chrysten constancye to be no lesse. Blandina prayed for her persecuters. So dyd Anne Askewe most feruentlye. The ashes of blandina and of other martirs, were throwne into the stood of Rhodanus. What was done with the Ashes of Anne Askewe & her companyons,Asshes. I can not yet tell.
                  All these former reportes of Blandina and manye more besydes, hath Eusebius in Ecclesiastica historia, libro. v. cap. i. ii. &. iii. Hugo Floriacensis, Hermannus Contractus,Autors. Vincentius, Antoninus, Petrus Equilinus, & other hystoryanes more. And as touchinge Anne Askewe, these. ii. examinacions, with her other knowen handelynges in Englande,Not all deed. are witnesse for her suffycyent. Thus hath not the fyre taken Anne Askewe al whole from the world, but left her here vnto it more pure, perfyghte, & precious than afore, as it wyl also Iohan

Lassels within short space. So that concernyng her, it maye well be sayde, that Paule verefyeth. ii. Cor. xii. The strength of God is here made perfyght by weakenes.Weakenesse. Whan she semed most feble, than was she most strōge. And gladlye she reioyced in that weakenes, that Christes power myght strongely dwell in her. Thus choseth the lord, the folysh of thys worlde to cōfounde the wyse, & the weake to deface the myghtye. Yea, thynges despysed & thought verye vyle to brynge thynges vnto naught whych the worlde hath in most hyghe reputaciō. I thincke if this martyr were rightly conferred,Martyrs. with those canonysed martyrs, whych haue had, and yet hath styl sensynges and syngynges, massynges & ryngynges ī the popes English churche cause with cause and reason wyth reason (as haplye here after they shal) she shuld be a great blemysh vnto them. An example of stronge sufferaunce myghte this holy martir be,Example. vnto all them that the Lorde shal after lyke manner put forewarde in this horryble furye of Antichriste, to the glorye of hys persecuted Churche. Amen.

                     A sacrament (sayth Saynt Augustyne) is a sygne, shappe, or symylytude of that it representith, and no God nor yet thynge represented. This worde reall or reallye,Reallye. is not of beleue, for it is not in all the sacred scriptures.

                     An ignoraūt woman, yea a beast wyth out fayth, is herin allowed to iudge the holy scriptures heresye, and agaynst al good lawes admitted to accuse thys godly woman the seruaūt of Christ, for an haynouse heretyke, for the only readinge of them.Accusers. As peruerse and blasphemouse was thys qwestmonger as she, & as beastlye ignoraūt in the doctryne of

Blessed is he (sayth Christ vnto Iohan) whych readeth & heareth the wordes of this prophecye. Apo. i. But of the latyne popysh masse, is not one word in al the Byble, and therfore it perteyneth not to fayth. A straight cōmaundement haue almyghty God geuen Deuteo. xii that nothing be added to hys word,Goddes worde. nor yet taken frō it. Put thou nothing vnto hys wordes (saith Salomon, Pro. xxx) least yu be foūde in so doynge, a reprobate persone and a lyar. S. Paule wylled nothynge to be vttered in a dead speche, i. Cor. xiiii.

Yf the yll frute than, be alone with the yl tree in noughtynesse, the worke of a deuyl must be deuelysh. God sayd vnto the wycked prestes, Esa. i. Hier. vi. Am. v. and Mala. ii. that he abhorred theyr sacrifyces,Sacryfyces. and also hated them, euen at the very hart, wyllynge both heauen &

earthe to marke it. Into Iudas entered Sathan, after the soppe was geuē hym. Ioā. xiii. wher as the other Apostles receyued the bodye and bloude of Christ. The table was all one to them both, so was the bread which their mouthes receyued. The inwarde receyuynges than in Peter and in Iudas, made all the diuersyte, whiche was beleue & vnbeleue, or faithe and vnfaythfulnesse, as Christ largelye declareth in the vi. of Iohan,Thevi. of Iohan. wheras he shewed a fore hande, the full doctryne of that misticall supper. Only he that beleueth, hath there the promes of the lyfe euerlastinge, and not he that eareth the materyall breade.

                     Here riseth the serpent of the cockatryce egges, workemāly to fulfyll the afore alleged prophecye. If their Masses had ben of Gods creasyon, ordynaunce or commaundement, or if they had bene in anye poynt necessary for mannys behoue, they had ben regestred in the boke of lyfe, which is the sacred Byble. But therin is neyther mencyon of Masse pryuate nor publique,Masses pryuate. seuerall nor commē. single nor double, hygh nor low, by fote nor on horse back, or by note as they cal it. If they be thynges addes by mannys inucucion (as they can be non other, not beyng there named) thā am I sure that the scriptures call thē filthynesse, rust, chaffe, draffe, swille, dronckēnesse, fornycaciō, mēstrue, mannys dyrt, adders egges, poyson, snares, the bread of wicked lyes, & the cuppe of Gods curse. Theyr origynall grounde shulde seme to be taken of the Druydes or pagane Prestes,Druydes. whych inhabyted this reauile long afore

Christes incarnacyon, and had than practysed sacryfices publique and pryuate. Loke Cornelius Tacitus, Caius Iulius, Plintus, Strabo, & soch othere authours. That name of pryuacyon added vnto their Masse, clerelie depriueth it of Christen communion, wher on man eateth vp all, & dystrybuteth nothinge.
                     How soche ware shulde helpe the sowles departed, I can not tell. But wele I wote,For sowles. that ye woūded man betwyxt Hierusalē and Hierico, had no helpe of thē Luce x. The Samaritane which was rekened but a pagane amonge them, was hys onlye cōfort, in ye most popysh tyme was neuer more horryble blasphemye, then this is. Thys wyckednesse impugneth all the promyses of God concerninge faithe, and remission of synnes. It repugneth also to the whole doctryne of ye Gospel. The applicaciō of Christes supper, auayleth them onlye that be alyue, takynge, eatynge, and drynkyng that is therin minystred. No more can the prestes receyuynge of that sacramente profight an other man,The prestes receyuynge. thā can hys receiuinge of Baptysme or of penaunce, as they call it. If it profyteth not the qwyck, how can it profyght the dead? No sacrifyce is ye Masse, nor yet good worke, but a blasphemouse prophanacyō of ye Lordes

holy supper, a manifest wickednesse an horryble Idolatrie, and a fowle abhomynacyon, beynge thus a ryte of worshyppynge without the worde, yea agaynst the expresse word of God.

                     Besydes thys my lorde Mayre layed one thynge vnto my charge whiche was neuer spoken of me, but of them. And that was whether a mouse eatynge the hoste, receyued God or no?

                     Is not here (thynke yow) wele fauerd & wele fashyoned dyuinyte, to establysh an artycle of the Christen faythe?

as it ded in Iudas. Thā foloweth fryre fynke, fryre Perin I shuld say,Peryn. a bachelar of the same scole. And he answereth in the ende of hys third sermon, that ye Sacramente eaten of a mouse, is the verye and reall bodye of Christe. And whan he hath affermed it to be no derogacyon to Christes presens, to lye in the mawe of that mouse.Diuisio. He deuydeth me the one from the other, the sacramēt frō Christes body, cōcluding. That though the sacrament be digested in the mouses mawe, yet ys not Christes body thee cō

                     Bycause these. ii. workemen be scant wittye in their owne occupacion, I shal brynge thē forth here. ii. olde artyfycers of theirs to helpe thē, Guimūdus Auersanus a byshopp,Guimundus. to helpe byshopp Steuen, & Thomas walden a fryre,Waldenus. to helpe fryre Perin. The sacramētes (saye they both) are not eatē of myce, though they seme so to be in the exteryour simylytudes. For ye vertues (saieth Guimundus) of holye men are not eaten of beastes, whan they are eaten of thē, li. ii. de corpore & sanguine dn̄i. No marrie (quoth walden) no more is the paynters occupacyon destroyed. whan a picture is destroyed. Marke this gere for your lernyng.

But now cometh Algerus a mōke,Algerus. more craftye thē they both, and he sayth li.ii. cap. i. de Eucharistia, that as wele is thys meate spyrituall, as materiall because Dauid calleth it the breade of Angels, and a breade frō heauē.

                     If we wolde attende wele vnto Christes dyuynyte, and let these oyled diuynes dispute amonge olde Gossypes, we shuld sone discharge myce and rattes, weake stomakes and parbreakyng dronkardes, of a farre other sort thā thus, he yt eateth my fleshe (sayth Christ) Io. vi. and drincketh my bloud dwelleth in me & I in him.Christus. This eatyng is all one with the dwellinge, & is neyther for myce nor rattes, brent chauncels nor dronkē prestes.

The substaunce of that most godlye refeccyon lyeth not in the mouth eatynge nor yet in the bellye feadyng, though they be necessarye, but in the onlye spirituall or sowle eatynge, No wyse man wyll thynke,Fayth. that Christ wyll dwell in a mouse, nor yet that a mouse can dwell in Christ, though it be

the doctryne of these doughtye dowsepers, for they shall fynde no scriptures for it. If these men were not enemyes to fayth and frindes to Idolatrie, they wold neuer teach soche fylthye lernynge.

This part plaied your olde generacion the Pharisees and prestes with Christ, to bring him in daūger of the lawe. Mat. xxii. & Ioha. viii.

                     Forthly he asked me yf the hoste shulde fall, and a beaste dyd eate it, whether the beaste dyd receyue God or no? I answered. Seynge ye haue taken the paynes to aske thys questyon, I desyre yow also to take so moche payne more, as to assoyle it youre selfe. For I wyll not do it, bycause I perceyue ye come to tempte me. And he sayde, it was agaynste the ordre of scoles, that he whiche asked the question, shuld answer it. I told him I was but a woman, & knewe not the course of scoles.

                     Beastlye was that question, and of a more beastlye brayne propouned to this womā. Lytle nede shall other men haue to manyfest theyr blasphemous folyes, whā they do it so playnely theyr selues Who euer hearde afore, that their hoste

Peryn. wyth other lyke popyshe heretikes haue taught now of late by their owne hande wrytynges. Oure God is in heauen, and cannot fall nor yet be eaten of beastes. Yf they haue soche a God, as maye both fall, and so be eaten, as thys prest here confessethe, it is some false or counterfet god of theyr owne makyng.

                     And the. xxiii. daye of Marche, my cosyne Brittayne came into the Counter to me, and asked there, whether I myghte be

matter was so haynouse, that he durste not of hymselfe do it, withoute my Lorde of London were made preuye therunto. But he sayde, he wolde speake vnto my Lorde in it. And bad hym repare vnto hym the next morowe and he shulde wele knowne my lordes pleasure.

My lorde declared vnto hym, that he was verye wele contented that I shulde come forthe to a communycacyon. And appoynted me to apere afore hym the next daye after, at .iii. of the clocke. at after noone. More ouer he sayde vnto hym, that he wolde there shulde be at that examynacyon,Wylye. Wylye. soche lerned men as I was affeccyoned to. That they myghte se, and also make report that I was handeled with no rygoure. He answered hym, that he knewe no man that I hadde more affeccyon to than othere. Than sayd the byshoppe. Yes,Subtyle. as I vnderstande, she is affeccioned

to Doctor Crome, Sir Gyllam, Whyteheade, and Huntyngton, that they might heare the matter. For she dyd knowe them to be lerned, and of a godlye iudgement.

                     A foxysh fauer was thys both of the chauncellour & byshopp, and soch a benyuolent gētilnesse, as not onli sought her bloude, but also the bloude of all them whych are here named,A wolfe. yf thei had than come to thys examynacyon. For the euenynge afore (as I am credybly infourmed) the Bishopp made boast amonge hys owne sort, that if they came thydre he wolde tye them a great deie shorter. A voyce was thys full lyke to hym that vttered it. For therby he apereth, not one that wyll saue and fede, but rather soche a one as seketh to kyll & destroye. Iohannis x.

                     Then brought he fourthe thys vnsauerye symylytude. That yf a man hadde a wounde, no wyse surgeon woulde mynystre helpe vnto it,Surgerye before he hadde seane it vncouered. In lyke case (saythe he) can I geue yow no good counsell,Counsell vnlesse I knowe where wyth youre conscyence is burdened. I answered, that my conscyence was clere in al thynges.

                     Then ye dryue me (saythe he) to laye to your charge, youre owne report, whyche is thys.Gathered store. Ye dyd saye, he that dothe receyue the sacrament by the handes of an yll prest or a synner, he receyueth the deuyll, and not God. To that I answered, that I neuer spake soch wordes. But as, I sayde a fore both to the qwest and to my lorde Mayte, so saye I nowe agayne, thatSinon cast. the wyckednesse of the preste

shuld not hurte me, but in sprete and fayth I receyued no lesse, the bodye and bloud of Christ. Then sayd the byshoppe vnto me, what a saynge is this? In sprete. I wil not take you at that aduauntage then I answered, my lorde with out fayth and sprete, I can not receyue him worthelye.

                     Now sheweth thys Cayphas where about he goeth, for all his false flatterynge colours afore. And seynge he can winne none aduaūtage to his cruel purpose, of her owne cōmunycacion, he shaketh the bougettes of his prouyded Iudases and betrayers of innocent bloud He bryngeth fourth suche stuffe and store,Bowgittes. as that wycked qwest had gathered of her answer to them, to flatter and to please his tyranny therwith. It is to be feared, that as farre was the feare of God here from thē, as from him, Psa. xiii. for as wel practised they thys myschefe agaynst her, as he.

dere mēbre. Malice, pryde whoredome, sodometrie, wyth other moste deuylysh vyces, reckeneth he not to hurte the minystracyon of a prest, yet iudgeth it he an heresye, no lesse worthye then deathe, to beleue that Christes fleshe and bloude is receyued in faythe and spret. What though it be Christes most ernest doctrine,a sore heresye. Ioan. vi. what a saynge (sayth this Bishopp) is thys? In sprete. I wyll not take yow at the worste, sayth he. As though it were a most haynous heresye. But mooste dyscrete and godlye was the womannes answere, declaringe her a ryghte membre of Christ, where as those prestes,Prestes. whō he here defendeth, are vnworthye receyuers and membres of the deuyl.

                     Then he layed vnto me, that I shoulde saye, that the sacramēt remaynynge in the pixte, was but breade.Breade. I answered that I neuer sayde so. But in dede the quest asked

me soche a question, whereunto I wold not answere (I said) tyll soche tyme as they hadde assoyled me this question of myne. Wherfore Steuen was stoned to deathe,Steuen. They sayde, they knewe not Then sayd I agayne, no more wolde I tell them what it was.

                     O Idolouse shepehearde (sayth zach.) thou sekest not to heale the wounded, but to eate the fleshe of the fatte. zach. xi The watche men of Israel (sayth the lorde) are verye blynde beastes and shamelesse dogges.Beastes. They haue no vnderstandinge, but folowe their owne beastly wayes for couetousnesse. Esaie. lvi. Who euer redde in the scripture or autorysed Chronycle, that breade in a boxe shulde be Christes bodye?The boxe. Wher or whā commaunded he his moste holye bodye, so to be bestowed? What haue ye to laye for thys doctrine of yours? Are ye not yet ashamed of your vnreuerent and blasphemouse beastlynesse? will ye still plucke our Christen beleue from ye right hand of God the eternall father, and sende it to a boxe of your braynyshe deuysynge?
                     
                        The first boxer of it, was pope Honorius the thyrde in the yeare of our lorde M.CC.XVI. after the many folde reuelacyons of dyuerse relygyouse women.Honorius Neyther was there anye great honour geuen vnto it of the common people, till a sorye solytarye syster or Ankorasse in the lande of Leodiū or Luke, called Eua after certen visions,Eua reclusa. had procured of pope Vrbanus the forth in the yeare of our Lorde. M.CC.LXIIII. the feaste of Corpus Christi to be holdē solempne all Christendome ouer. As testifieth Arnoldus Bostius,Bostius. Epist vi. ad Ioannem Paleonydorum. In al the. xii. hondred yeares afore that, was it neyther boxed nor pixed, honoured nor sensed vnyuersally And se what an horrible worke here is now, for the boxinge therof, and what a great heresie it is to beleue that Christ dwell not therin, contrary both to hys owne & to hys Apostles doctryne.Iudases. Marke also how this Gods creature is handeled here for it, and how subtyllye she is betraied of the Bishoppes begles and lymmes of the deuyll.

                     Then layde it my Lorde vnto me, that I hade alleged a certen

text of the scripture. I answered that I alleged none other but Saynte Paules owne saynge to the Athenianes, in the. xvii. chapter of the Apostles actes. That God dwelleth not in temples made wyth handes.Temples. Then asked he me, whate my faythe and beleue was in that matter? I answered hym. I beleue as the scripture doth teache me.A tēpter. Then enquyred he of me, what yf the scripture dothe saye that it is the bodye of Chryste? I beleue (sayde I) lyke as the scrypture doth teache me. Then asked he agayne, what yf the scrypture dothe saye that it is not the bodye of Christ? My answere was styll. I beleue as the scrypture infourmeth me. And vpon thys argumente he taryed a greate whyle, to haue dryuen me to

make him an answer to his minde Howe be it I wolde not, but concluded thus with hym, that I beleued therin and in all othere thynges, as Christ and hys holy Apostles dyd leaue them.

                     Se what an horryble synne here was. She alleged the scripture for her beleue,scripture. whyche is a sore and a daungerouse matter For it is agaynste the popes canon lawes, and agaynst the olde customes of holie churche. Sens kynge Henryes dayes the fourth, hath it ben a burnynge matter, onlye to reade it in the Englyshe tunge, and was called wycleues lernyng, tyll now of late years. And it wyll not be wele with holye churche, tyll it be brought to that point agayne. For it maketh manye heretykes agaynst holye churche. O insipyent papystes. These are your corrupted, practyses and abhomynable studyes,practyses. to dryue the symple from God, and yet ye thynke, he seyth yow not, Psalme. xiii. S.

                     Then he asked me, whye I had so fewe wordes?Fewe wordes. And I answered God hath geuen me the gyfte of knowlege, but not of vtteraunce. And Salomō sayth, that a womā of fewe wordes, is a gifte of God, Prouer. xix.

                     Thirdelye my lorde layed vnto my charge, that I shulde saye, that the Masse was ydolatrye I answered hym. No, I sayde not so. Howbeyt (I sayde) the quest dyd aske me, whether pryuate Masses dyd releue sowles departed,Priuate Masses. or no? Vnto whome than I answered. O Lorde, what ydolatrye is thys? that we shulde rather beleue in pryuate masses, than in the helthsome deathe of the dere sonne of God Than sayde my lorde agayne. What an answere was that? Thoughe it were but meane

(sayd I) yet was it good ynough for the question.

                     About the lattre dayes of Iohan wycleue, in ye yeare of our lorde a M.CCC. LXXXII. as Henrye Spenser than Bishopp of Norwich,Henrye. Spenser was with a great nombre of English warryours besieginge the Towne of Hypers in Flaunders, in the quarell of pope Vrbanus the. vi. The vessels of perdycyon or verye organes of Sathan, the iiii. orders of beggynge fryres,Frires. preached all Englande ouer, that that moste holye father of theirs, had lyberallye opened the wele of mercye, and graunted cleane remyssyon to all them that wolde eyther fyghte, or geue anye thynge towardes the mayntenaunce of those warres in the quarell of holye churche agaynst scysmatykes and heretikes. For than was thys matter of their popyshe Masse,Masses. in great controuersye lyke as it is now. More ouer thei promised by vertue of hys great pardons, to sende the sowles departed, to heauen. And diuerse of them sayd, they had seane thē flye vp, out of ye churche yeardes from their graues thydre warde.
                     Thys moste deuilishe blasphemie

wyth suche other lyke, prouoked the sayde Iohan wycleue,Iohan Wycleue. the verye organe of God, and vessell of the holy Ghost not onlye to replye than agaynste them at Oxforde in the open scooles, but also to wryte a greate nombre of bookes agaynst that pestylente popyshe kyngedome of theyrs lyke as Martyn Luther hath done also in our tyme, wyth many other godly men. And lyke as those false prophetes the frires dyd than attribute vnto the popes pardons,Pardons. the remyssyon of synnes, the deliueraunce from dāpnacyon, and the fre enteraunce of heauē whych peculyarly belongeth to the precyouse payment of Christes bloud. i. Petri. i. &. i. Io. i. So do these false anoynted, or blasphemouse Byshoppes and prestes now,Druydes attrybute them agayne vnto theyr pryuate and publique Masses the popes owne wares as prowlynge and pelferynge as the pardons, with no lesse blasphemye. The deuylysshenes of this newe doctrine of theyrs, shall be refelled in my bokes agaynst fryre Peryn and Wynchestre,Perin. and therfore I wrytte the lesse here.
                  
                  
                     Anne Askewe.
                     Then I tolde my Lorde, that there was a prest, whyche dyd heare

what I sayde there before my lord Mayre & them, with that the chaunceller answered,Chaunceler. which was the same prest. So she spake it in veri dede (saith he) before my lord the Mayre & me. Then were there certen prestes as doctor Standyshe & other,Stādyshe which tempted me moche to knowe my mynde. And I answered them alwayes thus. That I haue sayd to my lorde of London, I haue sayde.

                     By thys ye may se, that the Byshoppes haue euery wher their watchmē,Watchemen. lest the kynges offycers shulde do anye thynge, contrarye to their bloudie behoue. This Chauncellour wolde not haue thus answered hardely, so agreablye to her tale, had it not bene to theyr aduauntage agaynste her, as here after wyll apere.

                     And then doctor Standyshe desyered my lorde,I tempter. to byd me say my mynde, concernyng that same text of S. Paule. I answered, that it was agaynste saynt Paules lernynge, that I beynge a woman, shulde interprete the scriptures, specyallye wher so many wyse lerned men were.

                     It is not yet halfe a score of yeares ago, sens thys blasphemouse Idyote Standyshe,Stādyshe compared in a lewde sermon of his, the dere pryce of our redempcion, or precyouse blode of Christ, to the bloud of a fylthy swyne, lyke himselfe a swyne. And for hys good doyng, he is now becomen a dawe, a doctor I shuld saye,Doctor. of the popes dyuynyte, and a scolasticall interpretour of the scriptures to his behoue. Here wold ye swynysh gē

                     Then my lorde of London sayde he was infourmed, that one shulde aske of me, yf I woulde receyue the Sacramente at Easter, and I made a mocke of it.Accuser. Then I desyred that myne accuser myghte come fourth, whyche my lorde wolde not. But he sayde agayne vnto me. I sente one to geue yow good counsell, and at the first worde ye called him papyste. That I denied not, for I perceyued, he was no lesse, yet made I non answere vnto it.

                     No confortable scriptures, nor yet anye thynge to the sowles consolacyon,

                     Then he rebuked me, and saide that I shoulde reporte, that there were bente agaynste me thre score prestes at Lyncolne.Thre score prestes. In dede (quothe I) I sayde so. For my fryndes tolde me, yf I dyd come to Lyncolne, the prestes woulde assaulte me and put me to greate trouble, as therof they had made theyr boast. And whan I hearde it, I wente thyder in

                     Rebukes in that generacyō, are moch more redye at hande, than eyther Chrysten admonyshmentes, or gentyll exhortacions, though they be all spyrytuall.

Herin folowe they the examples of theyr natural predecessours the Iewysh byshoppes, pharysees, and prestes. Ioan. vii. &. ix. She myght full well saye, that the prestes were agaynst her. For hypocresy & Idolatrie were neuer yet wyth hym,Hypocresi whose blessed quarel she toke. Mark the forth chaptre of Iohan, and so fourth almost

                     Then my lorde asked,I prest. if there wer not one that dyd speake vnto me. I tolde hym, Yeas, that there was one of them at the laste whych dyd speake to me in dede And my lorde than asked me, whate he sayde?

                     Then sayde my lorde. There are manye that reade and knowe the scripture,Scripture & yet do not folowe it, nor lyue therafter. I sayde agayne.

                     I maruele that Byshoppes can not se thys in themselues, that they are also no folowers of the scriptures.Folowers But parauenture

they neuer reade them, but as they fynde them by chaunce in their popish portifolioms and maskyng bokes. Or els they thynke all the scriptures fulfylled whan they haue sayd their mattens and their masses. Chryste sayde to the hypocrite.

If we loked so ernestlye to Chrystes instytucions, as we loke to the popes to be obserued, these wold also be seane to, by acte of parlement, so wele as prestes marryage whom Christe neuer inhibyted.Marryage.

For the tyrannouse behauer in their cruell predecessours haue they no maner of shame.

                     IN the primatiue churche, as the horible persecucyons increased, many dyligēt writers collected the godly answers & tryumphaūte sufferinges of the martyrs, as necessarye examples of Christen constancye to be folowed of other. Of this nombre was Lucas, which wrote the Apostles actes So were after him Linus, Marcellus, Egesippus, Meliton Asianus, Abdias Babilonius,Wryters. Iosephus Antiochenus, Clemens Alexaūdrinus, Antherus, Phileas, Eusebius, Nicephorus, & a greate sorte more, Fabianus, not a chayre Byshopp, but a pulpet Byshop of Rome, ordayned in his tyme for that onely offyce vii. deacōs & so many notayres, aboute the yeare of oure lorde. CC. XXXVI. that they shuld faithfully regestre theyr martyrdomes,notaireye. to holde thē in contynual remembraunce, as witnesseth Platina Polydorus, Masseus, & soch other chronyclers. No les necessary is that offyce now though fewe mē attempt it, nor no lesse profytable to ye christē cōmō welthe than it was in those terryble dayes. For

now are persecucions all Christendome ouer, so wele as were than.Martyrs. Now are ye true Christians vexed of the syttynge Byshoppes for their Christen beleue, so wele as thā. Now are they reuiled, punyshed, imprisoned & haue all euyll spoken against them for Christes verites sake. Math. v. so wele as than.
                  And what can be more confortable to the sufferers,Sufferers than to knowe the ernest constancye of their troubled companyons in that kingedome of pacience? Apo. i. or to marke in them the stronge workynge of faythe, & beholde the myghtye mageste of God in their agonies? what though they were afore, synners of the worlde. Saynt Barnard sayth in his homelyes vpon Salomons cantycles,Bernardus, that the godlye sufferaunce of martyrs hath geuen as good erudycyon to the christen churche, as euer dyd the doctryne of the sayntes. Than is it mete that some besterynge, and not that all men in these dayes be ydell concernynge that godlye offyce. Manye haue suffered in thys realme of late yeares,Barnes & other. by the bolde calling on of Antichristes furyouse aduocates, whose lattre confessyons, causes, & answers, are a great deale more notable & godlye, if they be ryghtlye wayed, than euer were the confessyons, causes and

answers of the olde canonysed martirs which in the popes Englysh churche haue had so many solempnitees, seruices, and sensinges.Recāters. Manye haue also moste desperatly recanted through their most wicked persuacions and threttenynges in whose vaine recantaciōs are both to be seane, theyr blasphemyes agaynste God, and manyfest treasons agaynste their kinge.
                  Now in conferrynge these martyrs, the olde with the newe, and the popes with Christes. I seclude first of all the Brytayne churche, or ye primatiue churche of thys realme, which neuer had autoryte of ye Romishe pope.Brytayne churche. Her martirs in dede were agreable to that Chryste spake a fore in the Gospell concernyng his martyrs, wherby we shulde knowe thē, as we euydentlye finde in the liues of Emerita kinge Lucyes syster, Amphibalus, Albanus, Aaron, Iulius, Dionothus, & soche other. I sende yow forthe (saith he) as sh
                        •
                     pe amonge wolues. Mē shall delyuer ye vp in their counsels & sinagoges.Christ. Ye shall be brought before rulers and kinges, and be hated of all men in a maner for my names sake, Mathei x. Caste not afore in your mindes what answere to make. For I in that houre shal gyue ye both vtteraunce and wisdome,

which al your aduersaries shall not be hable to withstande, Luce xxi. They shall excommunycate yow or condēpne yow for heretikes. Yea,Byshoppes. they shall bring yow in soch hate of the world, that who so euer killeth yow, will thynke he doth God great good seruyce. And thys shall they do bycause they knowe rightly neither father nor yet me, Iohan. xvi.
                  Manye other lyke sentences left ye lorde Iesus Christ in his holie Gospell, yt we shulde alwayes by thē discerne hys true martyrs, frō the popes & Mahomettes coūterfet martyrs. In Englāde here sens the first plātacion of ye popes Englysh churche,Englysh churche. by Augustine & other Romish mōkes of Benettes supersticiō, ii. kindes of martyrs hath bene, One of monasterye buylders and chaunterye founders, whom the temporall princes & secular magystrates haue dyuerslie done to death, sumtyme for disobedience, and sumtyme for manifest treason, as we haue of Wallenus of Crowland,Martyrs. Thomas of Lācastre, Rycharde Scrope, Becket & soch other. The ymages of these haue bene set vp in their tēples, lyke the olde Gods of the paganes, & haue had theyr vigyls, holy dayes, ringinges, sacrifisīges, cādels offerīges, feastīges, & moch a do besides, as they had. The other

sort were preachers of the Gospell,Other martyrs. or poore teachers therof ī corners, whā the persecuciō was soche, that it myght not be taught abroade. And these poore sowles, or true seruauntes of God, were put to deathe by the holy spirituall fathers Byshoppes, prestes, monkes, chanons, & fryers, for heresye & lollerye, they saye. These Christen martyrs were neuer solēpnysed of them. No, they had not so moch as a peny dirge or a grote masse of Requiem,No dyrge no more thā had Iohan Baptyst and Steuen amonge the Iewes. But they haue bene holden for condempned heretykes euer sens.
                  Who euer hearde anye goodnesse yet reported of Dionothus with his M. & CC. companyous,Augustine whom Augustyne can sed to be slayne at Westchestre in hys churches begynnynge, bycause they wolde not preache as he dyd apoynt thē, nor baptyse after the Romysh maner, neyther yet hallow the Eastre feast as they dyd. Many a blessed creature, both men & womē, haue bene brēt sens Iohan Wycleues tyme & a fore,Wycleue. for onlye disclosynge the pharysees yokes & teachynge the Gospels liberte. And thē haue that bawdye bloudie Synagoge of Sathā dyffamed, blasphemed, condēpned, execrated & cursed to hell as most detestable heretykes

and dogges. Wher as if they were of Christ, they ought (in case they were their haters or enemies) to suffre thē,Suffre. to saye wele of them, to do them good, & to praye for them. Math. v. Luce. vi. & not thus to vse more tyrannie ouer them than euer dyd Saracene, Turke, Tiraūt or deuyll. A great dyfference is there of the martyrs whom they make, from the martyrs whom they canonyse. Of them whom they dampne,Difference of martyrs. from them whom they worshypp, yea so great a difference or dyuersyte betwine them (if ye marke them wele) as is betwyxt golde and dyrt, or light and darkenesse.
                  The martyrs,Martyrs. whose deathes they haue procured by all ages of theyr bloud-thursty church, harkned vnto Christ, healde of ryghtousnesse, and sought their lorde God in sprete, Esa. li, but the martyrs for the most part, whom they haue with so manye latyne wawlynges, torches & candell burnynges, magnyfyed in their temples, harkened to the pope, healde of hys vnrightousnesse, & sought out hys superstycyouse ydolatryes.Compare. In the conferrynge of their olde canonysed martyrs, with our newly condempned martyrs here. Anne Askewe and her other iii. companyons, with soche like, their difference will be moch more easelie

perceiued. First lete vs beginne with Thomas Becket,Becket. which was so gloryouse a martyr and precyouse aduocate of theirs, that they made his bloude equal with Christes bloude and desyred to clime to heauen therby. Manie wonderful miracles coulde that mitred patrone of theirs do in those dayes,Miracles whan the monkes had fryre Bakons bokes and knew the bestowynge of fryre Bōgaies mystes but now he can do none at al. Thys Becket in all hys floryshynge doynges, harkened to the pope, defended his pompouse kingedome, supported his churches excesse, & wretchedlye dyed for the synnefull lybertees of the same. Anne Askew & her sort,Ryght matyrs. gaue diligēt hede to their lorde Iesus Christ, soughte the kingedome of heauen in daylye repentaunce, mightelye detested all ydolatrouse worshippynges, & in conclusyon suffered moste tryumphaunt deathe for the same.
                  Cōcernynge other martyrs. As Wenefrid, otherwyse called Boniface an Englysh mōke & archebyshopp of Magunce was slaine cōfirminge neophytes,Bonifacius Anglꝰ or professynge his newlie baptysed brode to ye Romysh popes obediēce. There was foū
                     de aboute hym a casket full of rellickes or dead mēnis bones, whā he was put to death in the year of our lorde. vii. c. lv.

Anne Askewe & here felyshyp, had none other rellyckes aboute thē, whā they stode at the stake to be brent in Smythfelde but a bundell of the sacred scriptures inclosed in their hartes, and redye to be vttered aganist Antichristes ydolatries. Saynt Clare of Orchestre contemninge lawfull marryage,Clarus. made hym selfe an ydel prest, & was by headed in his owne gardene by procurimente of a womā. S. Clitāke of Southwales, was in like case stabbed in with a dagger,Clitancus bycause a yonge maiden loued him. The only true honoure of God was it, & no worldlye cause, that Anne Askewe & her companye dyed for. Saynt Edwyne being wel armed,Edwinꝰ was slayne in battayle at Hatfelde in the North, and S. Edwarde rydynge a Huntinge in the forest of Warham in the weast,Edwardus. was killed vpon hys horse in drinkinge a cuppe of wine. And all thys was done for the kyngedomes of thys worlde. The martyrdome of Anne Askewe and her Bretherne, was neyther in battelinge nor huntynge, rydynge nor drynkynge, but in that ryght course which Christ prescribed vnto his dyscyples vnder the cruell Byshoppes, for his onlye glorye.
                  Saynet Cadocke of Cowbridge a Bysshop,Cadocus. was pearced through with a speare,

as he stode at his Masse at one of the clocke at after non, bicause he wolde be of the ordre of martyrs. Saynte Elphege archebishopp of Caunterburye was stoned to deathe of the Danes, bycause he wolde not pase them thre. M. Marke, in the yeare of our lorde. M. & xii. Of soch martyrs, moch doubted Lā
                     francus,Lanfrancus. which suceeded him in that office about a iiii. score years after, and disputed therof with Anselmus. The cause of Anne Askewe and her companions, was neither madnesse nor moneye, but the onlie sekinge of their lord God righte. As Sainte Indract with other deuoute pilgrimes of Rome laie in bed in their inne at Shapwyck by Blastenbury,Indractus. their throtes were cut in the night for moneie, which was reckened to be in their pylgrymes scryppes. Saynt Iuthware a virgine was behedded also,Iuthwara. for layenge fresh chese or cruddes whether ye will to her brestes. The cause of Anne Askewe and her other fellowes, conferred with Christes scriptures semeth a farre other matter. Hewalde the blacke and Hewalde the whyght ii. Englysh mōkes,Newaldy duo. goynge frō place to place with cruettes, chalyce, and superaltare, to do their daylye sacrifices, were done to deathe in Frislande by the

bowers of the contrey for teachynge a straunge relygyon, and are worshypped at Coleyne for martyrs. For bearynge about Christes testament, which is most heauenlye treasure,Anne Askewe. and for spredynge ye wholsom doctrine therof, was Anne Askewe and her sort brēt by the prestes procuremēt, yet are they no honour for it.
                  Osytha runnynge awaye frome her husbande,Ositha. by the intysement of. ii. monkes became a professed nonne, and was murthered of the Danes. Wenefryda by counsell of a prest,Wenefrida. dysdaynouslye refusynge the marryage of a prynce chrystened, lost her head for it. Maxentia also played a parte not al vnlyke to thys.Maxētia. Soch pylde popysh martyrdomes, compared to the martyrdome of Anne Askewe and her faythful companye, is as is rustye yron compared to pure syluer.Guilhelmus. S. William of Rochestre a Scotte, leauynge both wife & houshold, ydly to trudge on pylgrymage, was strycken in the heade wyth an axe, of his owne companyon by the waye. Saynte Thomas of Douer a monke was suche a wone,Thomas. as was slayne of the frenche men for hydynge the churches iewels, crosses, chalyces & copes. No such light corruptible vanytees were they, that Anne Askewe & her constaunt bretherne dyed for, but

for the precyouse veryte of God. Yonge S. Wyllyam of Norwych,Yonge Sayntes yonge S Robert of Burye, yonge S. Hugh of Lyncolne, yōge S. Melor of Cornewayle, yōg s. Kenelme of Glocestre, yonge S. Eldrede of Rāsaye & his brother, wyth soch other lyke, were but verye babes (they saye) & were martyred of the Iewes & of other enemyes. Wherfore their martyrdomes shal be but babysh in cōparysō of these ye verite hauing by thē so smal furtheraūce
                  Foillanus & his. iii. bretherne,Foillanꝰ. goynge homeward in the nyghte, after they had well banketed wyth S.

After Kilianus was come home frome Rome,Kilianus he was murthered in his selle wyth other holye pylgrymes by a woman, as they laye there a slepe in the nyght. Saynt Vrsula also and her she pylgrymes,Vrsula. with theyr chaplaynes, nurses, and suckyng babes were but homely handeled at Coleyne of the hunnes and pietes (if that legende be true) as they were commynge homewardes from Rome. Compare me Anne Askewe

Yea, brynge saynte Edmound of Burye, saynt Fremūd of Dunstable, saynt Ethelbert of Herforde, S.

Fremūdꝰ and other and ye shall fynde theyr martyrdomes and causes full vnlyke to theyrs whome the Byshoppes murther now apace in Englande.

Ye wyll axe me here, if I reckē Englāde thā all barrē of Christē martyrs: Naye marry

do I not. For I knowe it hathe had good store sēs the popes faith came first into Englande to the Gospels obscuracyō, though their names be not knowne to al mē. Greate tyrānye was shewed by ye heythnysh emprours & kynges at the fyrst preachynge of ye Gospel in ye primatyue churche of ye brytaynes,Brytannyshe, by ye cruel callynge on of ye pagane prestes. But nothinge lyke to yt hath bene shewed sēs in ye Englysh church by ye spiritual tyraūt of Rome & his mytred termagaūtes,Englyshe. at ye prouocacyō of theyr oyled swylbolles & blīd Baalamites. For they most cruellye brēt those innocētes, whych dyd but only read ye testamēt of God in their mother runge, & do not yet repente them of that myschefe but contynewe therin.

Thei apered as shepe amonge wolues. They were throwne in strōg presō. They were brought forth into coūsels & synagoges. Their answeres were out of gods spret (as herin apereth) & not out of their own.Answers. They were reuyled, mocked, stocked, racked, execrated, condempned, and murthered, as is

sayde afore. By a spiritualte also, as he promised they shuld be. Mat. xxiii. and xxiiii. Yea, those spiritual tyrauntes besydes theyr mortal malyce vpō the innocent bodyes,Tyraūtes haue most blasphemouslye vttered in theyr spyghtful sermons and writynges, that their sowles are dampned, as is to be seane in the bokes of winchestre and Peryn.Winchostre Peryn. But let them be ware lest they dampne not theyr own wretched soules. For ful sure we are by Christes stronge promes. Luce. xii. That theyr sowles they can not harme wyth all theyr popes blacke curses. Ful swetelye rest they now in the peace of God, where theyr slaunderous and malyciouse iudgementes can not hurte them at al Sapi. iii.

They with that answere were not contented, but said, it was the kinges pleasure,Kyme. that I shulde open the matter to them. I answered them playnelye, that I wolde not so do. But if it were the kynges pleasure to heare me, I wolde shewe hym the truthe. Then they sayde, it was not mete for the kynge with me to be troubled. I answered, that Salomon was reckened the wysest kynge that euer lyued,Salomon yet myslyked not he to heare. ii. poore common womē,

                     Cōcernynge master Kyme, this shuld seme to be the matter. Her father Syr Wyllyam Askewe knyght and hys father olde master Kyme,Kyme. were sumtyme of famylyaryte and neybers within the countye of Lyncolne shyre. Wherupon the sayde Sir Wyllyam, couenaunted wyth hym for lucre, to haue hys eldest doughter marryed wyth hys sonne and heyre (as an vngodly maner it is in Englande moch vsed amonge noble men) And as it was her chaunce to dye afore the tyme of maryage,An vse. to saue the moneye he constrayned thys to supplye her to wine. So that in the ende she was cō
                        pelled against her wyll or fre consent to marry with him. Notwithstandynge the marryage ones paste, she demeaned her selfe lyke a Christen wyfe,Marryed. and hade by hym (as I am infourmed) ii. childrē. In processe of tyme by oft readynge of the sacred Bible, she fell clerelye from al olde supersticyons of papystrye to a

perfyght beleue in Iesus Christ. Wherby she so offēded the prestes (as is to be seane afore) that he at theyr suggestion, vyolentlye droue her oute of his howse. Wherupō she thought her selfe free frō that vncomelye kynde of coacted marryage,Exyled. by thys doctryne of S. Paule i. Cor. vii. If a faythfull woman haue an vnbeleuynge husbande, which wyll not tarrye with her, she may leaue him. For a brother or sister is not in subieccion to soch, specyallye where as the marryage afore is vnlawful. Vpō this occasiō (I heare saye) she soughte of the lawe a diuorcemēt frō him,Dyuorcement. namely & aboue al, bycause he so cruellye droue her out of his house in despyt of Chrystes veryte.

                     Then my lorde chauncellour asked me of my opynyon in the sacrament.Sacrament. My answere was thys. I beleue, that so oft as I in a Chrysten congregacyon, do

receiue the bread in remembraūce of Christes death, and with thankes geuynge accordynge to hys holye institucyon. I receyue therwith the frutes also of hys moost gloryouse passyon.

And as concernynge mockes and scornefull reuylynges,Mockers they haue bene euer in that generacyon of scorners more plenteouse than good counsels to the ryghtwyse. And therfore as a name after their condycyons, it is vnto them appropriate of the holye Ghoste in manye places of the scryptures. In the lattre dayes (sayth Iudas the apostle) shal

Then came my lorde Lyle, my lorde of Essexe, and the Byshoppe of winchester requirynge me ernestlye,Wynchester that I shoulde confesse the sacrament to be fleshe, bloude and bone Then sayde I to my Lorde Par and my Lorde Lyle, that it was

                        Then came mastre Pagette to me, and desyred me to speake my mynde to hym. I myghte (he sayde) denye it agayne, if nede were. I sayde, that I wolde not denye the truthe. He asked me, howe I coulde auoyde the verye wordes of Chryste. Take, eate, Thys is my bodye, whych shall be broken for yowe. I answered, that Chrystes meanynge was there,Christes meanyng as in these other places of the scrypture. I am the dore Ioan. x. I am the vyne. Ioan xv. Beholde the lambe of God Iohan. i. The rocke stone was Christe. i. Cor. x. and soche other lyke. Ye maye not here (sayde I) take Chryste for the materyall thynge that he is sygnyfyed by.Sygnyfye. For than ye wyll make hym a verye dore, a vyne, a lambe, and a stone, cleane contrarye to the

holy Ghostes meaninge. All these in dyde do sygnyfye Chryste, lyke as the breade dothe hys bodye in that place. And though he dyde saye there. Take, eate this in remembraunce of me.Remembraunce. Yet dyde he not bydde them hange vp that breade in a boxe, and make it a God, or bowe to it.

                     Moche ado is here made, and manye subtyl wayes are sought out, to brynge thys woman into their corrupted,Idolatrye. and false beleue, that the corruptyble creature made with handes, myghte stande in place of the eternall creatore or maker God and man for the prestes aduauntage. But all is in vayne. In no case wolde he so accept it. Nothing lesse mynded Chryst, than to dwell in the breade,Not in breade, or to become a feadinge for the bodye, whan he sayd. Take, eate. Thys is my bodye. For a contrarye doctryne he taughte hys dyscyples the yeare afore hys last supper, as we haue in the vi. chaptre of Iohan Where as he declareth hys flesh to be a spirtiuall meare, hys bloude a spirituall drynke, and both thē to be receyued

in faythe, the breade and the wyne remaynynge as sygnes of his euerlastinge couenaunt. Reason is it that he rather be iudged the receyuer whyche lyueth in that refeccyon than he which lyueth not therby. Whyche is the sowle & not the bodye.The eater What neaded Christe to haue geuen to those bodies a newe body lye feadynge, whiche were suffycyently fed afore with the passe ouer lambe? If he had not ment therin some other maner of thynge?
                     But he sufficiētlye ynough declareth hys owne meanynge, Luce xxii. Where he cōmaundeth vs to do it in his remē
                        braunce, and not to make hym agayne by blowynge vpon the breade. Thys sacramentall eatynge and drynkynge in his remēbraunce,Remembraunce. S. Paule more largely declareth, i. Cor. xi. So oft (saith he) as ye shall eate of that breade and drynke of that cuppe, ye shall shewe the lordes deathe tyll he come.Tyll he come. If ye ernestlie marke that lattre clause (tyll he cōe) ye shall wele perceiue that hys bodilye presēce in the breade, is vtterly denyed there. More ouer in the afore said xxii. chaptre of Luke, bycause we shuld not be to scrupulose, Christe sheweth what that wyne & breade of hys supper were, yea, as he left thē there, euē ī these wordes. I

saie vnto yow (saith he) that hens forth I shall not drynke of thys frute of the vyne (or eate of thys frute of wheate) tyll the kyngdome of God be come,Frute of the vyne. or tyll I drynke it new with yow in my fathers kingedome, Math. xxvi. Marci. xiiii. Here calleth it he ye iuse of ye grape or frute of the vyne, and not the bloude yssuynge from hys bodye. Yet is that cuppe (as S. Paule sayth) the partakynge of Christes bloude, and the bread that we breake there, the partakynge of Chrystes bodye,Partakynge. i. Corint xi. But that is in faythe and sprete, as afore in Iohan.

                     What an hurly burlye is here, for this newe beleue? that Christ shulde dwelle in the breade,In breade. which is mannys creature & not gods, Christe is the liuynge breade which came from heauē, Iohan. vi. But that is not sufficyēt (saye the prestes) on lesse ye beleue also, that he is that deade breade which came frō ye waffer bakers And therūto must ye set your owne hāde writynge,A waffer els wyll it not be allowed in the spirytuall courte. For he that speaketh greate thynges and blasphemyes (whiche is Antichriste) makinge warre with the sayntes,antychrist wyll haue it so, Apo. xiii. In the Apostles time, & many yeares after, it was ynough for a chrystē mān is ryghtwysnesse, to beleue with the hart, that Iesus is the lorde, & that God raysed hym vp from the dead. Roma. x. But now we must beleue that he cōmeth downe agayn at the wyll of the prestes, to be inpaned or inbreaded for their bellyes common welthe,Inpaned lyke as he afore came downe, at the wyll of hys heuenlye father,

to be incarnated or infleshed for our vnyuersall sowles helth. And vnto thys we muste set our hande writynge, that we may be knowen for Antichristes catrell.

This is my bodye, whyche shall be broken for yow, meaning in substaūce his owne verye bodie, the breade beinge therof an onlye sygne or sacramente. For after lyke maner of speakynge, he sayde he woulde breake downe the temple, and in iii. dayes buylde

it vp agayne, sygnyfyenge hys owne bodye by the temple,Temple. as, Saynte Iohan declareth it. Ioā ii. And not the stonye temple it selfe. So that the breade is but a remembraunce of hys death, or a sacrament of thankes geuynge for it, wherby we are knytte vnto hym by a communyon of Chrysten loue. Although there be manye that can not perceyue the true meanynge therof, for the vayle that Moses put ouer hys face before the children of Israel,Moses vayle that they shuld not se the clerenesse therof, Exo. xxxiiii. & ii.

So wyll ye saye, an other tyme for your pleasure & aduauntage, that he blessyd the temple also,Blessed and called it both the howse of his father, and also the howse of prayer. I pray ye, be as good here to your market place, as ye are to your sale wares therin, for your only bellyes sake. For ye one wyll not do wele to your commodyte in ydelnesse, withoute the other. But take good hede of it, yf ye lyst.Temple. For christ hath alredye called one of them an howse of merchaundyse and a denne of theues, by reason of your vnlawfull occupyenge therin, Ioan. ii. and Luce xix. He hath also promysed to ouerthrowe it, Math. xxiiii. and not to leaue one stone therof standyng vpon an other, Marci. xiii. Bycause ye haue not regarded the tyme of your vysytacyon, or not accepted hys eternall worde of helthe. A warnynge might the turnynge ouer of your monasteryes haue bene vnto yow,warnynge if ye were not, as ye are altogyther blynde.
                     I can not thynke the contrarye but he calleth the other also, as ye handle it now a dayes in the popes olde toyes of conueyaunce, the abhomynacion of desolacyon, or soche an abomynable ydoll as subuertynge Christes true religyon.The masse

Yet shall it endure (say the Daniel) sumwhere, vnto the ende of al Daniel. ix. Wherby ye maye well perceyue, that it comprehendethe not onely the tryumphaunt stremers of Tyberius or golden ymages of Caligula,Tyberius Caligula. whyche bothe preuented the subuersyon of Hierusalem, but some other ydolles which shulde contynewe. And it folowethe in the Gospell texte, that he shulde sytte in the holye place for the tyme of hys contynuaunce. Mathei. xxiiii. And not in the paganes temples. Tell me yf youre Masses be done anye where els,Masses. than in your hallowed sanctuaryes, vpon your sanctified aulters, and in your holy ornamentes and consecrate cuppes? Neyther may any do them, vnlesse they be anoynted therunto of your Byshoppes & sorcerers.
                     Not without the holy place (sayth-Christ) is that abhomynacyon, but in it, Mathei. xxiiii.

As for the other sort of prestes, she dyd not amys to laugh both them and their maynteners to scorne. For so doth God also, Psalme ii. And curseth both their absolucyons & blessynges, Mala. ii. A thefe or a murtherer shulde not haue

bene condempned without a queste, by the lawes of Englande. But the faythfull members of Iesus Christ, for the spyght and hate that thys worlde hath to hys veryte, must haue an other kinde of tyrannye added therunto,Tyranny. besides ye vnryghteouse bestowynge of that lawe.

the whole benefyghtes and frutes of hys mooste gloryouse passyon.

                     We reade not in the Gospell, that the materyall breade at Christes holye supper, was anye other wise taken of the Apostles, thā thus. Neither yet yt Chryste our mastre & sauer requyred anye other takynge of them. If so manye straunge doubtes had bene therin, and so hygh dyffycultees, as be moued and are in controuersye amonge men now a dayes both papystes and other, they coulde no more haue bene left vndyscussed of hym, than other high matters were.Apostles▪

Not a fewe of most euydent argumentes are therin, to proue her the true seruaunt of God.Proue her Her wyttes were not ones dystracted, for all her most tyrānouse handelynges.

                  With this worlde wyl I fyght
                  And fayth shalbe my shyelde.
                  Fayth is that weapon stronge
                  Whych wyl not fayle at nede
                  My foes therfore amonge.
                  Therwyth wyll I procede.
                  As it is had in strengthe
                  And force of Christes waye,
                  It wyll preuayle at lengthe
                  Though all the deuyls saye naye.
                  Fayth in the fathers olde
                  Obtayned ryghtwysnes
                  Whych make me verye bolde
                  To feare no worldes dystresse.
                  I nowe reioce in harte
                  And hope byd me do so,
                  For Christ wyll take my part
                  And ease me of my wo.
                  Thou sayst lorde, who so knocke
                  To them wylt thou attende
                  Vndo therfore the locke
                  And thy stronge power sende.
                  More enemyes now I haue
                  Than heeres vpon my head
                  Let them not me depraue
                  But fyght thou in my steade.
                  On the my care I cast
                  For all theyr cruell spyght
                  I set not by theyr hast
                  
                     For thou art my delyght.
                  I am not she that lyst
                  My anker to let fall
                  For euerye drystynge myst
                  My shyppe substancyall.
                  Not oft vse I to wryght
                  In prose nor yet in tyme
                  Yet wyll I shewe our syght
                  That I sawe in my tyme.
                  I sawe a tyall trone
                  Where Iustyce shulde haue sytte
                  But in her stede was one
                  Of modye cruell wytte.
                  Absorpt was tyghtwysnesse
                  As of the ragynge floude
                  Sathan in hys excesse
                  Suete vp the gyltelesse bloude.
                  Then thought I, Iesus lorde
                  Whan thou shalte iudge vs all
                  Harde is it to recorde
                  On these men what wyl fall.
                  Yet lorde I the desyre
                  For that they do to me
                  Let them not tast the hyre
                  Of theyr inyquyte.
                  God saue the kynge.
                  
                     
                        God hath chosē the weake thynges of ye world to confounde thynges which are myghty. Yea, & thynges of no reputaciō, for to bryng to nought thynges of reputacion, that no fleshe shulde presume in his syght.

                  The Conclusyon.
                  THus hast thou (dylygente reader) the ende of these. ii. examynaciōs and answers of the moost christen martyr Anne Askewe, wt other addycyons besydes. Marke in thē the horryble mad furye of Antychrist and the deuyll how they worke in thys age by their tyrannous mēbres,Antichrist to brynge the last vengeaunce swyftlye vpon thē. Afore tyme hath not bene seane, soch frantyck outrage as is now, the iudges wythout all sober dyscressyon, ronnynyge to the racke toggynge, halynge, and pullynge therat, lyke tormentours in a playe.compassiō
                      Compare me here Pylate wythe Wrisleye the hyghe chauncellour of Englande, wyth Riche and wyth other whych wyl be counted no small moates. And se howe moch the pagane Iudge excelleth in vertue and wisdom, the false christened iudge, yea, rather prodygyouse tyraunte. Whan Pylate had enquired,Pylate what accusacyon the Iewes clergye had agaynste Christ, he perceyued they dyd all of malyce, and refused to meddle therin. Ioan. xviii. In Wrisleye and Ryche is no suche equite.Wrisleye. But they rather seke occasyon to accomplyshe the full malyce of Antychriste.
                  Pylate shewed the accused all fauerPylate
                     
possyble. He examyned hym pryuatelye he gaue hym fryndelye wordes, he had hym not feare to speake, he hearde hym wyth gentylnesse, he counselled wyth hym that he myght the more frelye suppresse theyr madde furye, and he promysed, they shulde do hym no wrong in case he wolde vtter his ful mynd. Ioā. xviii Farre contrarye to this were Wrisleye and Ryche,Wrysleye whych not all ignoraunt of the Byshoppes beastlye errours, malycyouslye wythout all feare of God and shame of the worlde, executed vpon this godly woman moste terryble tyrannye. Pylate spake for the innocent,Pylate. excused hym, defended hym, layed fourth the lawe, pleated for hym sharpelye, required them to shewe mercye, alleged for hym theyr custome, declared him an innocent & sought by all meanes to delyuer hym, Mat xxvii. These periured magistrates Wrisleye & Ryche,Wrisleye. not onlye examyned thys innocent woman with rigour, but also hated her, scorned her, reuyled her, condempned her, for an heretike, & with vnspeakable tormentes sought to enforce her to brynge by accusacion other noble women and men to death.
                  More ouer Pylate wolde shede no innocent bloud,Pylate. but laboured to mytigate the Byshoppes furye, & instaūted them

as they were relygiouse, to shew godlye fauer, concludynge that he coulde by no lawe of iustice, iudge him worthie to die Marci. xv. These vengeable tyrauntes Wrisleye and Riche insaciably thirsted.Wrisleye not onlie the innocēt bloud of this faithfull seruaunt of God, but also the bloud of the noble duchesse of Sothfolke, the bloud of the worthye countesse of Hertforde, and of the vertuouse countesse of Suffexe, the bloude of the faythfull ladye Dennye,Ladyes. of the good lady Fizwilliams, and of other godlye women more, soche widowes and wiues as Paule, Peter, and Iohan commendeth in their epistles, besydes the bloude of serten noblemen of the kynges hygh counsell. And all at the spyghtfull callynge on of the Byshoppes. Slacke eare gaue Pilate to the prestes,Pylate. he regarded not ther dyspleasure, he detected their proternouse madnesse, by delayes he dyfferred the sentence, and fynallye washed hys handes as one that was clere from their tyrannie, Luce. xxiii. Swyft eare gaue Wrisleye & Ryche with their wycked affynyte to ye puffed vp porkelynges of the pope Gardiner,Wrisleye & Riche. Bonner, & soch other, they folowed their reuell counsell, they enprysoned her, iudged her, condempned her, & racked her, at the laste with their owne

poluted bloudie tormentours hādes, till the vaynes and synnowes brast.
                  If ye marke the scriptures wele, ye shall easelye perceyue that Pylate was not in fawte of Chrystes bufferynges,Pylate, bearynges, scornynges, face spyttynges, crownynge with thorne, and soch other extreme handelynges. But the malycyouse Byshoppes & prestes which waged Iudas to betraye hym,Prestes. hyred false wytnesse to accuse hym, monyed the multitude to dyffame hym, fayned false matter agaynste hym, compelled the lawe and terrifyed the iudge, to haue their full myschefe accomplished, as our Bishoppes haue done in thys cruell acte and soche other. Whan the prestes wolde haue blemished hys name by the ignomyniouse deathe whiche he suffred amonge theues on the crosse, Pilate proclamed it gloriouse vnto all the worlde,Pylate. writinge his title in Hebrue, Greke, and Latine, Iesus of Nazareth kinge of the Iewes, and wolde not at their instaūt callinge on, chāge it, Ioā. xvi. Wrisleie & Riche with their vngracyouse affynyte,Wrysleye haue in euerye poynt folowed here the execrable affectes of the prestes. Fauorablye Pilate licensed Ioseph of Arymathye to take downe Christes bodie, and to burie it.

Math. xxvii. Wrisleye cōmaunded thys martyr of God with her faythfull companyons to be brent to ashes. Pylate was ignoraunt of Gods lawes,Pilate. and a pagane Wrisleye and Ryche know both the lawe and the Gospell,Wrisleye and are christyanes, the more is it to their dampnacyon, to execute soch turkish tyrannye.
                  Now to conclude with Anne Askewe as the argument of thys boke requireth In the yeare of our lord a M.D.XLVI And in the moneth of Iulye, at the prodygyouse procuremente of Antichristes furyouse remnaunt, Gardyner,Brent. Bonner and soch lyke, she sufferd most cruell deathe ī Smythfelde with her iii. faithfull companyons, Iohā Lassels a gentylmā whych had bene her instructour, Iohan Adlam a tayler,Martyrs and a prest so constaunt in the veryte agaynst the sayd Antichristes supersticyons as they, whose name at this tyme I had not. Credybyle am I infourmed by dyuerse duche marchauntes whych were there present, that in ye time of their sufferinges, the skie abhorringe so wycked an acte,A sygne. sodenly altered coloure, and the cloudes frō aboue gaue a thōder clappe, not al vnlyke to that is writtē, Psa. lxxvi. The elemētes both declared therin the hygh dyspleasure of God for so tyrānouse a murther of innocentes.Gods hā
                        de.
                     
and also expreslye sygnyfyed his mightye hande present to the comfort of them whych trusted in hym, besydes the most wonderfull mutacyon which wyll within short space therupon folowe. And lyke as the Centuryon with those that were with hym,Centurio for the tokens shewed at Christes deathe, confessed hym to be ye sonne of God, Math. xxvii. So dyd a greate nombre at the burnynge of these martyrs, vpon the syght of thys open experymēt, afferme them to be his faythfull members.
                  Full manye Christen hart haue rysen and wyll ryse from the pope to Chryste through the occasyon of their consumynge in the fyre.Christianes. As the saynge is, of their ashes wyll more of the same opynyon aryse. Manye a wone sayth yet both in Englande and Duchelande, also,Take hede O that woman that woman, O those men those men. If the popes generacyon and wycked remnaunt make manye more soch martyrs, they are lyke to marre all their whole market in Englande. It were best for thē now a dayes to lete men be at lyberte for their holye fathers gaudish ceremonies,Ceremonyes. as they are for beare baytynges, cocke fyghtynges tennys playe, tables, tombelinge, daunsynge, or hūtynge, who list & who maye.

for as little haue those tradiciōs of his of the worde of God, in their prowdest out shewe, as they haue. Here wyll some tender stomakes be greued,Tendrelynges, and report that in our headye hastinesse, we refuse to suffre with our weake bretherne accordynge to the doctryne of Paule. But I saye vnto them, what so euer they be whyche are so scrupulouse wanderers, that they most execrablye erre in so bestowynge the scryptures. For abhomynable is that tolleraunce of our brethernes weakenesse,Hypocresye. where God is by ydolatrouse superstycyons dysobeyed, dyshonoured, and blasphemed. A playne practyse were thys of Sathan in hypocresye to vpholde all deuylyshnesse
                  On the other side was there an other sort at the deathe of these blessyd martyrs,Papystes and they iudged of this alteracion of the ayre and thonder clappe, as dyd the Iewysh Byshoppes with their peruerted multitude. Whyche waggynge their heades, rayled, reuyled, iangled, iested, scorned, cursed, mocked, and mowed at Christes precyouse sufferynges on the crosse,Prestes. Mat xxvii. and Luce xxiii. These were the ydle wytted prestes at London and their beastlye ygnoraunt broodes with olde superstycyouse bawdes

and brethels, the popes blynde cattell.Bawdes. These cryed there like madde me dye bedlemes, as they hearde the thonder. They are dampned, they are dampned, their wyse preachers outasynge the same at Paules crosse, In dede full no billie are they ouerseane in the Bible that iudge the thonders to signifie dāpnacion. Thonder (saith the scripture) is ye voice of god,Thōders. Eccle. xliii. Thonder is ye helpinge power of ye lorde, Iob. xxvii. and no dampnacion. Christe called Iohan and Iames the sonnes of thonder, Marci iii. Whiche betokened that they shuld be ernest preachers, and no chyldren of dampnacion. The lorde by thonder sheweth hys inscrutable workinge,Thonder. Iob. xxxviii. Moses receiued ye lawe. Helias the sprete of prophecie, the Apostles the holye Ghost, & all in thonder. What wicked sole will saye, they receiued so dampnacion?
                  As the lambe had opened the first seale of the boke, the voice that went forth was as it had bene thonder, Apoca. vi. whiche is no dampnacion,Apocal. but a sharpe callinge of people to Godwarde. The thonderynges that apered whan the Angell filled his censer.Thōders. Apoc viii. were no dampnacions but Gods crueste wordes rebukinge the worlde for sinne. The

best interpretours do cal those thōderinges which came from the trone of God. Apocal. iiii. soch verites of the scripture as terrifieth synners, and no dampnacions. Neyther were the vii. thonderynges whyche gaue their voices, Apoc. x. anye other than mysteryes at their times to be opened, Eucherius Lugdunensis & other moralisers,Eucheryꝰ call thonders in the scripture, the voyces of the Gospell, and their lighteninges, the clere openinges of the same. If thōder be a thretteninge or a fearfull iudgement of God (as in Psal. ciii.) it is to them that abyde here, and not to them that depart frō hens. A token is it also that the horrible tirauntes shall be as the meledust,For tyrauntes. that the winde taketh awaye sodenlie, Esaie xxix. If Plage do folow of thōder, as it dyd in Egypt, whan Moses stretched forth his rodde, Exodi. ix.North folke. It shal light vpon them which hath shewed the tirā
                     nouse vyolence on the people of God, as it dyd vpon pharao and his cruell minysters.
                  At the mightye voyce which was both sensyble hearde and understandyd of the Apostles from heauen,Markewele. that the father was & wolde be glorified by Christ the people said nothinge but, It thondereth, Ioan. xii. For nothinge els they

vnderstode therof. What Anne Askewe and her companyons both hearde and se in thys thonder to their sowles cōsolacyon in their paynefull sufferinges, no mortall vnderstandinge can discerne. Onlye was it Steuen (and paraduenture a fewe dysciples) that se the heauens open whan he suffered,S. Steuē
                      and not the cruell multitude which ranne vpon him with stones, Acto. vii. Lete beastlie blinde babbyllers and bawdes with their charmynge chaplaynes than prate at large, out of theyr malycyouse sprete and ydle braynes. We haue in habundaunce the veryte of Gods worde and promes,gods wordes to proue them both saued and gloryfyed in Christe. For God euer preserueth them which trust in him, Psal. xvi. All that call vpon hys holye name, are saued, Iobel. ii. What reasonable man will thynke that they can be loste, whyche haue their lorde God more dere than their owne lyues? No man shall be hable (sayth Christ) to plucke my shepe out of my handes,Not lost. but I wyll geue thē eternall lyfe, Ioan. x. Beleue (sayth Paule to the iayler at Philippos) on ye lorde Iesus Christ, and thou shall be saued & thy whole howsholde, Acto. xvi. They that seme in the sight of the vnwyse to go into destruccyon, do rest in the

peace of God, and are replenished with immortalite, Sapien. iii. With other in numerable scriptures, to the praise of God, whose name be glorified worlde without ende, Amen.
                  FINIS.
                  God saue the kynge.
                  Thus endeth the lattre conflict of Anne Askewe, latelye done to deathe by the Romysh popes malycyouse remnaunt, and now canonysed in the preciouse bloude of the lorde Iesus Chryste Imprynted at Marpurg in the lande of Hessen. 16, die Ianuary, anno 1.5.4.7.
