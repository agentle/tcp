               THe fyrst commaundement is that thou oughtest to praye and adoure god thy creatour onely and none other / For yf so were that honoure and reuerence that is due to god / were gyuen to ony other creature / than to god / that shold be ydolatrye as thou shalt here hereafter / And thou oughtest to knowe that there be fyue maners / for to bere and doo honoure and reuerence to god hys creatour / That is to wete / to werke / adoure / swere sacrefyse / & preyse by cause that god is the vnyuersel commaundour of alle our production / begynnyng 
                  and gouernemente / Thou oughtest to knowe that Idolatrye is none other thynge / but tenbaunce and gyue the reuerence / that ought to be gyuen to god to ony other creature / Therfore I wyl shewe how ydolatrye was fyrst founde / and there ben fyue causes / The fyrst was for to eschewe the malencolye of the dethe of somme persones / herof recounteth the wyse man / of a man that loste his sone / whome he loued moche hertelye / 

But for teschewe the malencolye of the dethe of his sone / and for to haue perpetuel remembraunce of hym / dyd do make an ymage vnto the resemblaunce of the fygure of hys sone / the whiche ymage he commaunded to be worshypped by hys subgettes and seruauntes vpon payne of Inobedyence / Of this fyrst cause of ydolatrye recounteth saynt Gregore in his xj chappytre of saynt luke / How the kynge of nynyue whan he was dede in batayle his sone whiche was kynge after hym / dyd do make an ymage to the resemblaunce of hys fader / the whiche ymage he adoured deuoutely / & commaunded expressely to be worshypped 
                  and 
                  adoured of al the subgettes of hys royame / And to thende that his subgettee shold haue the more gretter deuocion to the sayd ymage / he dyd doo make an edycte or a decree / that al they that had 
                  commysed offence ageynst the ryal mageste / that they shold adoure the sayd ymage / and al that so dyd 
                  shold be pardoned / The second cause wherfore ydolatrye was founden was for the grete pryde and surquerdrye of somme prynces whiche somtyme made them to be adoured 
                  and worshypped as god / As we haue an ensaumple of the kynge Nabugodonosor / For to the ende that he shold be adoured as god / He commaunded to olofernes whiche was prynce of his londe and of his chyualrye / that he shold destroye all the goddes of his royame / to thende that he shold be reputed and honoured as god in al his contre / The thyrd cause was foū
                  den by adulacion or flaterye / For to Impetre somme graces ageynst somme lordes / as done they that ben poure / whyche adoure the ryche prynces & grete lordes as they were goddes / For to haue theyr grace and benyuolence / herof recoūteth saynt austyn in the tenthe boke of the cyte of god that sayth / that many thynges ben taken aweye fro thonoure and 
                  adouryng deuyne / the which ben atrybued & gyuen to kynges & prynces temporel / in geuyng to them gretter honoure & reuerence thā they do to god / this spice of ydolatrye regneth yet at this day with kynges & prynces of this world which make them self to be adoured more thā god / The iiij cause of ydolatrye / was by cause that they adoured the ydolles / whā they were requyred of ony thynge / and that they gate or had as they demaūded
                  
they supposed that the deuyls that were within the ymages had myght & power vpon them & vpon the Elementes / as for to do sece al tempestes / al maladyes / & aduersitees that myght happen to them / whiche thynge was suffred to come to them by deuyne suffraunce / as it shal be declared herafter / The v cause of ydolatrye was for his euyl couetyse / and that was for to gete the goodes & honoures of this world / as done they
