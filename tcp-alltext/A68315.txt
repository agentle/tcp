I demanded a ſight of his warrant: he anſwered that he would doe it / and I might afterward if I were wronged / bring mine action. So he locked me vp in priſon / and forthwith went to his Lords grace to Lambeth. About one of the clock he returned / and brought with him 2. purſuvantes. I was forthwith put into a boat / and caried to Lambeth. By the way / one of the purſuvants called Watſon / drew out of his boſo
                     ••
                   a letter from the court of Lambeth vnto me / ſaying how he had a long time ſought me. I told him / his paynes deſerved thanks / neither at Gods handes nor mine: I refuſed his letter / and ſaid that I obeyed neither it nor him / neither would I read it / ſhewing how I was vnder the arreſt of the keeper of the Clinke who ſate by me. Wel / we arrived at Lambeth / wher after I had peruſed the B. his ſtate / I was brought into his preſence chamber / yet not vntil this Watſon had prevented me / and ſhewed his maiſter what had paſſed in the boat.
               
                  Arch B.
                  Barrowe / is your name Barrowe?
               
               
                  B.
                  Yea.
               
               
                  A.
                  It is told me / that yow refuſe to receiue or obey our letter / know yow what yow doe? it is from the high commiſſioners / and this man a purſuvant.
               
               
                  B.
                  I refuſed to receive or obey that letter at that time.
               
               
                  A.
                  Why ſo?
               
               
                  B.
                  Becauſe I was vnder arreſt / and impriſoned without warrant / and againſt law: and therfore now it was too late to bring the letter.
               
               
                  A.
                  Why / may not a Counſellor commit to priſon by his bare commandement?
                  (alledging how the Aldermen of London doe daily.)
               
               
                  B.
                  That is not the queſtion / what a counſellor may doe: but whither this man may doe it without warrant / by the law of the land:
                  (pointing to the keeper of the Clinke.)

law againſt yow: I pray yow why haue yow impriſoned me / and after this manner ſent for me?
               
               
                  A.
                  That yow ſhal know vpon yowr oath: wil now ſweare?
               
               
                  B.
                  I hold it lawful to ſweare / ſo it be done with due order and circumſtances.
               
               
                  A.
                  Reach a book / hold it him.

                  To ſweare.

                  Yow ſhal not ſweare by the book / but by God oncly.

                  So I purpoſe when I ſweare.
               
               
                  Cuſ.
                  Did yow neuer take an oath at an Aſſiſe before the Judges there?
               
               
                  B.
                  No.

                  A.
                  Why man the book is no part of the oath / it is but a cerimonie.
               
               
                  B.
                  A needleſſe and wicked ceremonie.

                  Why know yow what yow ſay? know yow what book it is? it is the Bible.
               
               
                  B.
                  I wil ſweare by no Bible.

                  A.
                  Wel wil yow lay your hand on the Bible and take an oath.
               
               
                  B.
                  I vſe to ioyne no creatures to the name of God in an oath.
               
               
                  A
                  Neither ſhal yow / this is but a cuſtome commanded by law.
               
               
                  B.
                  The law ought not to commannd a wicked cuſtome.

                  Why yow hold it lawful to lay your hand on the table and ſweare?

                  If it be nothing of the othe / why doe yow ſo peremptorilie inioyne it? and if it be indifferent as yow ſay it is / then doe I wel in not vſing it.

                  Yow ſpeak not as yow thinck / for yow are prowd.

                  I haue ſmal cauſe to be prowd of my memorie / yow ſee yt default of it: but the Apoſtle ſaith it. Againe they al denyed it. Yow then haue no cauſe to condemne my memorie / ſeing yow al haue vtterly forgotten this ſayeng. Then repeated I the words: Al thinges are lawful for me / but I wil not be brought in bondage to my libertie. Then they recited. Rom. 14. and 1. Corint. 8. al thinges are lawful for me / but al thinges are not expedient. I ſaid I meant not that place.

                  B.
                  Why yow vnderſtand Engliſh: is not the word of God in Engliſh? Then Cuſſin began to ſpeak of indefinita propoſitio, but whervpon I can not cal to remembranc:

                      I told him we were now about the new Teſtament / it might be if he had aſked me that queſtion when I knew him in Cambridge / I ſhould then haue anſwered him he forthwith called to remembrance of what howſe I was.

                  Yea / I knew yow there. He ſaid he was there before I was borne. I ſaid it might be. Then he entred into diſcourſe of his antiquititie. Then he aſked me if I had read books / as Calvin / Beza etc▪ I anſwered that I had read more then ynough: But yet I know not why I am empriſoned.

                  I haue not learned ſo to ſweare / I wil firſt know and conſider of the matter before I take an oath. Thus many thinges being alleaged to and fro by vs / the Arch B. commaunded Cuſſin to recorde / that I refuſed to ſweare vpon a book.

                  I ſo meane. Then commanded he the firſt queſtion to be thus written. Queſt. 1. Whither he thinketh the Lordes prayer may publickly in the Church / or privatly be vſed as a prayer or no?
(When I had expreſſed my minde / the Arch B. commaunded it ſhould be recorded: but I deſired the judges that I might with my owne hande write my owne anſwers / which was graunted me.)
My anſwer then to the firſt queſtion was. Anſ. It is to be vſed to that ende for which it was giuen by our ſauiour Chriſt to his diſciples / as a ſununarie groundworke or foundation of al faithful prayers / wherby to inſtruct and aſſure their conſciēces / that their petitions are according to the wil and glory of God: But that theſe preſcript wordes are i

(Heere the Arch B. cried out for breuitie / and would not ſuffer me to anſwer any more queſtions at large.)
Queſt. 2. Wither he thinketh that any Leitourgies / or preſcript formes of prayer may be impoſed vpon the church: and whither al read and ſtinted prayers be mere babling in Gods ſight? Anſ. I finde in the worde of God

                      ſuch authoritie giuen to any man / neither ſuch ſtinted leitourgies preſcribed or vſed in the primitiue churches: and therfore hold it high preſumtion to impoſe any one deuiſed Apocrypha praier vpon the church.
                  Q. 3. Whither he thinketh that the common praiers commaunded by the publick authoritie of this land / be idolatrous ſuperſtitious and popiſh? A. I thinke that this book of common prayer publickly inioyned and receiued in the aſſemblies of this lande / is wel nigh altogither idolatrous ſuperſtitious and popiſh. Q. 4. Whither he thinketh that the Sacraments which are publikly adminiſtred in the church of England be true Sacramentes or no? A. I thinke that the Sacramētes as they are miniſtred in theſe publike aſſemblies / are not true Sacramentes: and ſeale not the fauour and bleſſing of God vnto them. Q. 5. Whither he thinketh that the lawes and gouerment of the church of England now by authoritie eſtabliſhed be vnlawful and Antichriſtian / or no? A. Becauſe the lawes decrees and canons of your church are ſo many and infinite / I can not iudge of them al / becauſe I know not al: but this I ſay / that many of them / as alſo your Eccleſiaſtical courtes and gouernours / are vnlawful and Antichriſtian. Q. 6. Whither he thinketh that ſuch as haue bene baptiſed in the church of England / ſince Queene Eliſabethes reigne / haue bene rightly baptiſed / or ought to be baptiſed againe? A. I thinke as before of yowr Sacramentes / that they haue not bene rightly baptiſed / according to the inſtitution of Chriſt: Yet that they need not / neither ought to be baptiſed againe. (I doubt leaſt the Arch B. hearing my anſwer of rebaptiſing / cauſed it to be left out of the queſtion and my anſwer / taking that which might beſt ſerue their owne turne / to bring vs into ſuſpicion of error / and hatred. Herevnto many ſpeeches ariſing of the true and falſe Sacramentes / miniſterie / gouerment / as alſo of the true and falſe church: I ſhewed that the falſe church had alſo her Sacramentes miniſtery / gouerment / though not aright. Then Judge Anderſon cauſed this queſtion to be moued to me. Q 7. Whither the church of England as it ſtandeth now eſtabliſhed / be the true eſtabliſhed church of Chriſt: and whither the people therin / be the true and faithful people of God / or no. A. I thinke that theſe pariſh aſſemblies as they ſtand generally in England / are not the true eſtabliſhed

churches of Chriſt: and that the people as they now ſtand in this diſorder and confuſion in them / are not to be held the true and faithful people of Chriſt. Here the Judge Anderſon took exception
(as the B. of Lond. alſo)
at theſe wordes
(pariſh aſſemblies.)
I anſwered the Judge / that I could not for ſome weightie reſpectes ſpare him that word: for I doubted not / but that the Lord had many pretious and elect veſſels among them / whom he wil in his good time cal forth / whom it became not me abſolutely to iudge leaſt I ſhould enter into Gods ſeat: Yet I could not in the meane time whiles they ſtand members of theſe aſſemblies / count them faithful. To the B. I ſaid / that when they ſhould better conſider of mine anſwer / they ſhould haue leſſe cauſe to finde fault. Much trouble we had before we could agree of the ſtate and wordes of their queſtions / with putting out and changing / which diſcourſes it is not my purpoſe here to ſet downe ſo much as the queſtions and anſwers agreed vpon and recorded: although

The chief juſtice of Engl. here ſaide that he thought I anſwered very directly and compendiouſly. Here againe / vpon ſome ſpeech that aroſe / the Judge Anderſon aſked me whither I thought it lawful to hang a theef or no? I anſwered that ther were many kinde of theeues / as ſacrilegious theeues / men ſtealers etc. that theſe ought by the lawes of God to die. Then he ſaid he meant ordinary theeues of goodes and chattels. I ſaid / that God in the law had ordeyned an other kinde of puniſhment for ſuch / whervpon the Bb. framed this queſtion. Q. 9. Whither it be lawful for the Prince to alter the iudicial lawe of Moſes / according to the ſtate of her countrie and pollicie / or no? A. I ought to be wiſe in ſobrietie / 

and not to anſwer more then I know. Great doubt and controverſie hath bene about this queſtion a long time / but for my part I can not ſee / that any more of the iudicial law was or can be abrogated by any mortal man or countrie / vpon what occaſion ſoeuer / then belonged to the ceremonial law and worſhip of the Temple / for which we haue received other lawes and worſhip in Chriſtes teſtament: but that the iudgementes due and ſet downe by God for the tranſgreſſion of the moral law / cānot be changed or altered / without iniury to the moral law and God himſelfe. Yet this / as al my other anſwers by proteſtation / that if any man can better inſtruct me therin by the word of God / I am alwayes ready to change my minde. Whervpon the cheif Juſtice of Engl. ſaid I ſpake wel: and therfore ſaid if I were in doubt / mine anſwer ought not to be taken. I ſaid / I doubted not / but had ſet downe my minde. Yet the Bbs. becauſe my anſwer fitted not their turnes / as I thinke / commaunded the queſtion and anſwer to be blotted out. Q. 10 Whither he thinketh that any priuate man may take vpon him to reforme / if the Prince wil not / or neglect.
(I aſked whither they meant of a publick reformation of the ſtate / or of a private or perſonal reformation of himſelf and his family: it was ſaid / of a publick reformation)
A.

I ſaid it was not true / they denyed not / neither defied the Pope: but I was ready to giue and performe as much vnto my Prince as any true ſubiect ought to doe. He aſked me againe whither the church of Chriſt / if the Pruite deny or refuſe to neglect abuſes / may without ſtaying for the Prince reforme them? I ſaid / that it might and ought though al the Princes of the world ſhould prohibit the ſame vpon paine of death.

                  The Lord knoweth I am ignorant / I haue no learning to boaſt of: but this I know / that yow are voide of al true learning and godlines.
               
               
                  L. Buckh.
                  See the ſpirit of this man. Then requeſted I conference againe / and that in writing: which was againe by Cant. very peremtorilie denyed. He ſaid that he had matter to cal me before him for an hereticke.
               
               
                  B.
                  That ſhal yow neuer doe: yow know my former anſwer to that matter: wel erre I may / but hereticke / by the grace of God wil I neuer be.
               
               
                  L. Buckh.
                  That is wel ſaid. The L. Tr: then taking vp a paper of Somes abſtract queſtions / which lay among the Bs euidence againſt me / read this: That I held it vnlawful to enacte a law that the miniſters ſhal liue by tithes / or the people pay them: and demaunded of me whither I held tithes vnlawful?

                  B.
                  I took the bible and turned to theſe two places. Heb. 7 / 12. Gal. 6 / 6. in the one where tithes are abrogate: in the other / that an other proviſion is made for them.
               
               
                  Lond.

                  B.
                  Why / the wordes of the text are theſe: If the preiſthod be changed / then of neceſſitie muſt ther be a change of the law: and yow cannot deny but that tithes were a part of that law: alleging / Num. 18.

                  No my Lo. but I would haue yow to withhold none of your goodes from helping him: neither rich nor pore are exemted from this duty. ffurder I ſhewed / that if the miniſter had thinges neceſſarie / as food and rapment / he ought to hold him ſelf contented: neither ought the church to giue him more. Then had we ſome talke concerning the word Preiſt: the L. Tr. ſaid that the miniſters now were not to be called preiſtes.
               
               
                  B.
                  If they receiue tithes they are preiſtes. Moreouer they be called preiſtes in the law.

                  It is no latine word / but deriued / and ſignifieth the ſame which the greek word doth / which is an Elder. Lon. what makeſt thow a preiſt? B.

                  B.
                  His name is Elmar my Lo.
                  (The Lord pardon my fault / that I laid him not open for a wolfe / a bloody perſecutor and Apoſtata. But by this time / the Wardens man plucked me vp.)

                  B.
                  The Lord gaue me the ſpirit of boldnes / ſo that I anſwered: He is a monſter / a miſerable compound / I know not what to make him: he is neither Eccleſiaſtical nor ciuil / euen that ſecond Beaſt ſpoken of in the Reuelation.

                  So I turned to the 13. Chap. and began at the 11. verſe / and read a litle. Then I turned to 2. Theſ. 2. But the Beaſt / aroſe for anger / gnaſhing his teeth / and ſaid / wiſ yow ſuffer him my Lords? So I was pluckt vp by the Wardens man

from my 
                        •
                     nees / and caried away. As I was 
                        •
                     e parting / I deſired the Lo. Treaſ. that I might haue the libertie of the aire / but had no anſwer: and I prayed the Lord to bleſſe their honours. So I was led forth by an other way then I came in / that I might not ſee the brethren / nor they me. This is the effect / ſo neere as my euil memorie could cary away / the very wordes that were vſed to me and by me in that place. The Lord pardon my vnworthines / and vnſanctified hart and mouth / which can bring no glory to the Lord / or benefite to his church: but rather reproch to the one / and affliction to the other. But the Lord knoweth how to deliuer the godly out of tentation / and to reſerue the vniuſt vntil the day of iudgement vnder puniſhment. The L. Treaſ. admoniſhed me / and told me that I took the Lords name often in vaine: I haue forgotten vpon what occaſion he ſpake it. But I beſeech the Lord that I may not forget this his good admonition / but may ſet a more careful watch before my lippes: for ſure no doubt I am greatly guiltie that way / and neuer vſe his holy name with that reuerence I ought.
               
            
            
               THe anſwers of John Grenewood / at London pallace / before the 2. L. chief Juſtices of Engl. the Mr. of the Rolles / the L. chief Baron / togither with the Arch B. of Cant. the B. of Lond. the B. of Winch. with others: to certaine interrogatories as foloweth.
               Q. WHat is your name? A. John. Grenewood. Q. Lay yowr hand vpen the book / yow muſt take an oath. A. I wil ſweare by the name of God if ther be any need / but not by or vpon a book. Q. We wil then examine yow without an oath. Are yow a miniſter? A. No / I was one after your orders. Q. Who diſgraded yow? A. I diſgraded my ſelf through Gods mercy by repentance. (then after many wordes / they brought forth a paper conteyning certaine articles in manner of queſtions as foloweth) Q. Is is lawful to vſe the Lordes prayer publickly or privatly as a prayer / or no? A. It is a doctrine to direct al our prayers by: but ſeing it conteyneth the doctrine of the holy Scripture / no man can vſe the ſame as a private or publick prayer / becauſe he hath not preſent need to aſke al the peticions therin conteyned / at one time: neither can comprehend them with feeling and faith. Q. Is it lawful or no? I wil heare no pratling. A. It is not lawful for any thing I can ſee by the Scripture for ther is no commaundement to ſay the very wordes ouer: and Chriſt and his Apoſtles prayed in other wordes according to their preſent neceſſitie. Q. Is it lawful to vſe any ſtinted prayers either publickly or privatly in prayer? A. They are Apocrypha / and may not be vſed in the publick aſſemblie: the word / and the graces of Gods ſpirit / are onely to be vſed there. Q. Anſwer directly / is it lawful to vſe them publickly or privatly?

A. Paul ſaith in Rom. 8. the ſpirit of God maketh requeſt for vs / and, that we know not what to aſke / but the ſpirit helpeth our infirmities Q. Anſwer directly. A. It is not lawful to vſe ſtinted prayers invented by man / either publickly or privatly for any thing I can ſee by the Scriptures. Q. What ſay yow then to the book of common prayer / is it ſuperſtitious popiſh and idolatrous / yea or no? A. I beſeech yow that I may not be vrged by your law: I haue thus long bene cloſe priſoner / and therfore deſire yow to ſhew me wherfore / and not now to entangle me by your law. Q. Is it not yowr law now as wel as ours: it is the Queenes law: Yow are a good ſubiect. A. I am obedient as a true ſubiect. But I took it we had reaſoned of your popiſh canons. Q. Is not the common prayer booke / eſtabliſhed by the Queenes law?
               
                  L. Cheif Juſt.
                  Tel vs what yow thinke of the book of common prayer / yow ſhal haue libertie to calback what yow wil againe. A. If it were in free conference / as it hath bene often deſired by vs / I would ſo doe.
               
               
                  Winch.
                  Haue yow not vſed theſe wordes a yeare a goe / that it was popiſh ſuperſtitious and idolatrous? A. Yes I thinc
                        •
                      I haue: for it was taken out of the Popes portuis. Q. Why would yow not anſwer ſo before? A. Becauſe I ſee yow goe about to bring me with in the compaſſe of the law.
               
               
                  I. Anderſon.
                  What ſay yow now to 
                        〈◊〉
                     ? A. That ther ar many errors in it / and the forme therof is diſagreeable to the Scriptures.
               
               
                  Arch B.
                  Is it contrary to the Scriptures. A. It muſt needs be contrary if it be diſagreable.
               
               
                  Winch.
                  Whither hold yow it idolatrous / ſuperſtitious and popiſh? A. I haue anſwered what I thinke of it: I hold it ful of errors / and the forme therof diſagreable to the Scriptures. Q. What ſay yow for mariage: did not yow marie one Boman and his wife▪ in the Fleet? A. No / neither is mariage a part of the miniſters office. Q. Who did vſe prayer? A. I thinke / I did at that time vſe prayer. Q. Who ioyned their handes togither? A. I know no ſuch thing / they did publickly acknowledge their conſent before the aſſemblie.

                  B.
                  They may make ſuch mariages vnder a hedge / and it hath bene along receiued order to be maried by the miniſter. A. No / ther were many faithful witneſſes of their conſentes: and if it were not lawful / we haue many examples of the ancient fathers / who by your iudgement did amiſſe. Q. What ſay yow to the church of England / is it a true eſtabliſhed church of God? A. The whole common wealth is not a church.
               
               
                  I. Anderſ.
                  But doe yow know any true eſtabliſhed church in the land? A. If I did / I would not accuſe them vnto yow. Q. But what ſay yow / is not the whole land as it ſtandeth now ordered / a true eſtabliſhed church? A. No / not as the aſſemblies are generally ordered / if it pleaſe yow / I

wil ſhew yow the reaſons.
               
               
                  L C. Juſt.
                  No / yow ſhal haue ynough hereafter to ſhew the reaſons / it is not now to be ſtood vpon. Q. What doe yow ſay to the church of England as it is now guided by Bbs. is it Antichriſtian? A. Bp ſuch Bs. and lawes as it is now guided / it is not according to the Scriptures.
               
               
                  Winch.
                  Thow haſt Scriptures often in thy mouth: is it then Antichriſtian. A. Yea / I hold it contrarie to Chriſtes word. Q. What ſay yow to the Sacramentes then / are they true Sacramentes? A. No / they are neither rightly adminiſtred according to Chriſtes inſtitution / neither haue promiſe of grace / becauſe yow keep not the covenant. Q. Speak plainly / are they true Sacramentes or no? A. No / if yow haue no true church y
                        •
                     w can haue no true Sacramentes. Q. How ſay yow / are we baptiſed? A. Yea / yow haue the outward ſigne which is the waſhing / but no true Sacrament. Q. How can that be? A. Very wel.
(then I thought to haue ſhewed reaſons / but I could not be ſuffred.)
Q. Is it lawful Baptiſme? A. Yea. Q. Need we then to be baptiſed againe if we had that miniſterie and gouerment yow ſpeak of? A. No. Q. Should we be baptiſed at al? A. Yea / or els if we contenme it / we deny the profeſſion of grace. Q. Doe yow hold it lawful to baptiſe children? A. Yea / I am no Anabaptiſt I thanke God. Q. How far differ yow? A. So far as truth from errors. Q. Yow haue a boy vnbaptiſed / how old is he? A. A yeare and a halfe. Q. What is his name? A. Abel. Q. Who gaue him that name? A. Myſelf / being father. Q. Why hath he not bene baptiſed? A. Becauſe that I haue bene in priſon / and cannot tel where to goe to a reformed church / wher I might haue him baptiſed according to Gods ordinance. Q. Wil yow goe to church to S
                        •
                     . Brides? A. I know no ſuch church. Q. Wil yow goe to Pauls? A. No. Q. Doe yow not hold a pariſh / the church? A. If al the people were faithful hauing Gods law and ordinances practiſed amongſt them / I doe. Q. Then yow hold that the pariſh / doe not make it a church? A. No / but the profeſſion which the people make. Q. Doe yow hold that the church ought to be gouerned by a Preſbyterie? A. Yea / euery congregation of Chriſt ought to be gouerned by that Preſbyterie which Chriſt hath appointed. Q. What are thoſe officers? A. Paſtor / Teacher / Elder / etc. Q. And by no other? A. No / by no other then Chriſt hath appointed. Q. May this people and preſbyterie reforme ſuch thinges as be amiſſe without the Prince? A. They ought to practiſe Gods lawes / and correct vice br the cenſure of the word. Q. What if the Prince forbid them? A. They muſt doe that which God commaundeth neuertheleſſe. Q. If the Prince doe offende / whither may the preſbyterie excommunicate the Prince or no? A. The wole church may excommunicate any member of that congregation, If the partie continue obſtinate in open tranſgreſſion.

Q. Whither may the Prince be excommunicate? A. Ther is no exception of perſon: and I doubt not but her maieſtie would be ruled by the word / for it is not the men / but the word of God which bindeth and looſeth ſinne. Q. Whither may the Prince make lawes in the gouerment of the church / or no? A. The Scripture hath ſet downe ſufficient lawes for the worſhip of God / and gouerment of the church / to which no man may adde or diminiſh. Q. What ſay yow to the Princes ſupremacie / is her maieſtie ſupreme head of the church: ouer al cauſes / as wel eccleſiaſtical as temporal? A. A ſupreme magiſtr

                        ••

                  IT is ſtrange vnto me / that yow hold ſuch opinions (Penry) as none of the learned of this age / or any of the martyrs of former times mainterned. Can yow ſhew any writers / either old or new / that haue bene of your iudgement?

                  If yow meane by a church (as the moſt doe) that publick profeſſion wherby men doe profeſſe ſaluation to be had by the death and righteouſnes of Jeſus Chriſt / I am free from denping

any church of Chriſt to be in this land: for I know the doctrine touching the holy trinitie / the natures and offices of the Lord Jeſus / free iuſtification by him / both the Sacramentes / etc. publiſhed by her maieſties authoritie and commaunded by her lawes / to be the Lordes bleſſed and vndoubted truthes / without the knowledge and profeſſion wherof no ſaluation is to be had.

(by the Lords helpe)
to be deriued / not from Jeſus Chriſt / but from the kingdome of Antichriſt his great enemie. And therfore for as much as I cannot be partaker of the former holy thinges of God / but I muſt be ſubiect vnto the power of Antichriſt in theſe officers / and knowen by thoſe markes wherby his ſubiectes are noted / therfore I am enforced and bound to ſeek the comfort of the word and Sacramentes / wher I may haue them without the ſubmitting of my ſelf vnto any eccleſiaſtical power in religion / ſaue onely vnto that which is deriued from Chriſt Jeſus the Lord / in whom al fulnes of power dwelleth / (Col. 1. 19.) and from whom al thoſe muſt deriue their power and office / vnto whom the ſaintes of God are to ſubmitte their conſciences to be wrought vpon in religion. Againe / ſeing the forenamed 4. enormities of this church / are markes which properly belong vnto the kingdome of the Beaſt / viz. of the Romane Antichriſt / we dare not haue any communion and fellowſhip with them / nor be knowen by them / leaſt we ſhould be partakers of thoſe moſt fearful and moſt dreadful iudgementes / which are denounced by the ſpirit of God / againſt al thoſe that haue communion with any of the irreligious inventions of that Beaſt. Reuel. 14 / 9. 10. Theſe are the thinges / togither with the want of Chriſtes true order / which I eſpecially miſlike / and the ſpecial cauſes why I dare not ioyne with the aſſemblies of this Land. 1. the falſe offices wherby theſe aſſemblies are guided / and by whom the whole worſhip is performed in them: 2. their manner of caling / 3. a great part of the deviſed workes wherin theſe officers are converſant. 4. the livinges conſecrated ſometimes vnto Idols for the moſt part / wherby they are ſuſteyned in their offices.

The church of Chriſt is perfect without them / in al her offices: the ciuil ſtate is abſolute without them / for they are eccleſiaſtical: Heathen idolatrie hath them not / and requireth them not / onely the kingdome of Antichriſt can in no wiſe be whole and entire without them / wherof
(as I ſay)
they are viſible and knowne members. Now if it be not lawful for me / or any other member of Chriſt / to be ſubiect vnto the orders and cerimonies of the old law as circumciſion / etc. Which ſometimes were the Lordes owne bleſſed ordinances: how can it be but ſin vnto vs to be ſubiect to the conſtitutions of Antichriſt / the maine adverſarie of the Lo.

                  Ther is great reaſon we ſhould not: for if the order left by Moſes in the church: was not to be altered / to be diminiſhed or added vnto / except it were by ſpecial commaundement from the Lord: (1. Chron. 28 / 19.) then may not any man or Angel / but upon the ſame warrant / adde any thing vnto that holy forme / which the ſonne of God left for the ordering of his owne howſe: for / as the Apoſtle ſaith / Hebr. 3 / 3. he / (Yea and his ordinances) are worthy of more honour then Moſes his were. And he that addeth vnto the wordes of this book / that is / to the true order of the church / and pure worſhip of God conteyned therin / the Lord God wil adde vnto him of the plagues that are written in this book / ſaith the ſpirit of God.

                  He was firſt a moncke / and ſo a member (by his office) of the kingdome of Antichriſt / euen a good while after the Lord had vſed him as a notable inſtrument to ouerthrow that kingdome / afterward he was vtterly diſgraded and depriued of al offices / ſo that as the ſpirit of God ſaith (Reu. 13. 17.) he could neither buy nor ſel by vertue of any libertie or freedome that he had within the kingdome of the Beaſt. And by this meanes in the Lords great favour / he caried not in this regarde any of the Beaſtes markes / he was not of his name / nor of the number of his name: he denied himſelf to belong to that kingdome of Satan / and that malignant church vtterly refuſed him to be any of her body and members.

(2. Theſ. 2 / 8.) Of his office I iudge the beſt / as of a matter vnknowne vnto me / that is / I thinke him to haue had a paſtoral office in the church of Wittemberg / whither he had or not / his example is no law for the church to walke by / it is Chr. Jeſus alone that we muſt heare and folow / according to his wil and word muſt we frame our walking / and if it be an Angel from heauen that wil draw vs to ſwarue from the ſame / we dare not giue eare vnto him.

                  I haue no office in that pore congregation: and as for our meetinges either in woods or any where els / we haue the example of our ſauiour Chriſt / of his church and ſervantes in al ages / for our warrant: it is againſt our willes that we goe into woods / or ſecret places: as we are not aſhamed of the goſpel of Chriſt / ſo our deſire is to profeſſe the ſame openly / we are ready before men and Angels / to ſhew and to juſtifie our meetings and our behauiour in them / deſiring earneſtly that we may haue peace and queietnes to ſerue our God euen before al men / that they may be witneſſes of our vpright walking towards our God and al the world / eſpecially towards our Prince and countrie. We know that meeting in woods / in taues / in mountaines / etc. is a part of the croſſe and baſenes of the goſpel / wherat it is eaſy for the natural man to ſtumble: but we are gladly partakers of this meane eſtate for the Lords ſacred veritie: and the queſtion ſhould not be ſo much where we meet / as what we doe in our meetings / whither our meetings and doings he warranted by the word or not / and what inforced vs to meet in theſe places.

I haue taught publickly in the church of Scotland, being thervnto deſired earneſtly / and called by the order of that church: charge I neuer had any / and therfore I neuer bare office either there or in any other church.

Hence it is that the iudges of this land are bound by law to adminiſter iuſtice and equitie vnto the poore ſubiects / notwithſtāding that the princes letters be directed to them to the contrary.

Yea the prophet Jeremie being in no leſſe daunger and diſgrace with al eſtates then I and my brethren are at this preſent / required his ſoueraigne Lord and king Zedekiah to promiſe that he would doe him no violēce and wrong nor yet ſuffer others to doe the ſame / for telling him the truth of the word / in the thinges wherin the king required / to be reſolued at his hā

But alas I enter not to ſcanne her maieſties oath / I onely tel yow what her lawes alow me and my poore brethren.

This was it that I ſaid vnto yow / namely that I gainſaid nothing in this whole cauſe / but what I could proue out of the word of God / to be the remnants of the popiſh Antichriſtian kingdome which religion I ſaid / the Lord hath promiſed vtterly to ouerthrow and conſume / in ſo much as yow
(ſaid I)
may liue / though yow be already of great yeares
(for my ſelf I may be cut of by vntimely death)
to ſee al the offices / calings / works and livings / deriued from / or belonging at any time vnto the kingdome of Antichriſt / vtterly ouerthrowē in this land: for the Lo. hath promiſed that that man of ſin / that body of the Antichriſtiā religion / ſhalbe ſo conſumed by the breath of his mouth and the brightnes of his appearing in the power of his goſpel / before his ſecond coming (2. Theſ. 2.) as that falſe ſynagogue ſhal haue no power in any

of her officers or partes / either to be lifted vp ouer the

This I ſhewed yow to be verified in the type / Babylon of the Chaldeans / according to the word of the Lo. ſpoken by Iſaiah and Jeremiah and the caſting of the ſtone into Euphrates by Sheraiah at Jeremies commandement (Iſa. 13. 19. 20. Jer. 50. 40. and 51. 61. 64.) and this I ſhewed to be decreed by the Lo. of hoſtes / againſt the true body / the Antichriſtian Babel vnder the new teſtament / for ſo we are taught by the ſpirit of God / that ſhe ſhalbe conſumed and be no more / that her chapmen ſhal in this life bewaile / and the ſaincts of God reioyce at her vtter ouer throw and at the ſpoile and decay of her merchandiſe / Reuelat. 18. The comparing of the act done by Sheraiah againſt the type / and what followed thervpon / with that of the Angel againſt the true Babylon / I declared moſt fully to confirme my ſpeech: for Sheraiah throwing the ſtone into Euphrates ſaid / thus ſhal Babel be drowned and riſe no more, and ſo it came to paſſe: the Angel in the Reuel caſting the great ſtone into the ſea / ſaith / with ſuch violēce ſhal the great city Babylō be caſt, and ſhalbe found no more: and ſo it wilbe accompliſhed I am ſure. This was my ſpeech vnto yow Mr. Young / and I beſeech yow / yea and charge yow as yow ſhal anſwer in that great day / not to miſreport my ſpeeches / but to relate them as they are vttered by me.

After this ſort did the Lord conſume the Popes primacie / office and maintenance which he had in this land / and after this maner did he conſume by his goſpel / the Cardinals / Priors / Abbots / Moncks / Friers and Nunnes out of this lād / and after this or ſome other way ſeeming beſt to his wiſedome / ſhal he

The traiterous Jeſuits and ſeminary preiſts / hoping to poſſeſſe theſe execrable livings and offices againe / are alſo therby allured readily to become moſt vnnatural traitors againſt their natural Prince and countrie / and the Papiſts at home / are by this meanes kept ſtil in remembrāce of that Romiſh Egipt / and in continual expectation of their long deſired day: wheras if theſe offices and livings were once removed
(the deviſed works and calings would fal with them)
the Pope and his trafiquers would be vtterly void of al hope to ſet vp the ſtanderd of the man of ſin againe in this noble kingdome / here being not ſo much as an office / or one pēny of maintenance left for any of his members: the Jeſuits and preiſts would haue no allurements to make them rebelles againſt their Prince / and the other ſeduced Papiſts at home / would eaſily forget their idolatrie / ther being here neither office nor any other monument of that antichriſtian religion left / to put them in mind of that Babel / and ſo the Lord would accompliſh that which thapoſtle ſaith ſhalbe fulfilled / euen the vtter conſuming of the man of ſin in this land.
