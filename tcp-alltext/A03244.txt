            To the Reader.
            
               I Thath beene no custome in mee of all other men (curteous Readers) to commit my plaies to the presse the reason, though some may attribute to my own insufficiencie, I had rather subscribe in that to their seueare censure, then by seeling to auoide the imputation of weakenes, to incurre a greater suspition of honestie: for though some haue vsed a double sale of their labours, first to the Stage, and after to the presse, For my owne part I heere proclaime my selfe euer faithfull in the first, and neuer guiltie of the last: yet since some of my plaies haue (vnknown to me, and without any of my direction) accidentally come into the Printers handes, and therfore so corrupt and mangled, (coppied onely by the eare) that I haue bene as vnable to know them, as ashamde to chalenge them. This therefore I was the willinger to furnish out in his natiue habit: first beeing by consent, next because the rest haue beene so wronged in beeing publisht in such sauadge and ragged ornaments: accept it Curteous Gentlemen, and prooue as fauourable Readers as wee haue found you gratious Auditors.

               For which he shall be countant to his end.
               I haue sounded all the Peires and Senators,
               and though vnknowne to thee my Tullia,

               No, I was cousen to the Tarquins, when they were subiects, but dare claime no kindred, as they are soueraignes: Brutus is not so mad though he be merrie, but hee hath wit enough to keepe his head on his shoulders.

                  Collatine is troubled with the common disease of all new married men, hee's sick of the wife, his excuse is forsooth that Lucrece wil not let him goe, but you hauing neither wife nor wit to hould you, I hope will not disapoint vs.

               The time I hope for, cannot be conscribde,
               Within so short alimit, Rome and I
               Are not so happy, what's the reason then
               Heauen spares his rod so long? Mercury tell me:
               I hat'e: the fruite of pride is yet but greene,
               Not mellow, though it grows apace, it comes not
               To his ful height: Ioue oft delayes his vengeance,
               That when it haps t'may prooue more terrible.
               Dispaire not Brutus then but let thy country
               And thee take this last comfort after all,
               Pride when thy fruite is ripe must rot and fall.
               But to the Oracle.

                  His faire words so bewitch my delight,
                  That I dote on his sight.
                  Now all is gone new desires embraceing,

               Whose voyce should thunder conusell in the eares

               The bloud of the slaughtred sacrifice made this flore as slippry as the place where Tarquin treades, tis glassy and as smoth as yce: I was proud to heare the Oracle so gracious to the bloud of the Tarquins and so I fell.

               Madam strange newes: Prince Sextus by the enemies of Rome
               
               Was nobly vsde and made their Generall,
               Twice hath he met his father in the field,
               And foild him by the warlick Gabines aid:
               But how hath he rewarded that braue Nation,
               That in his great disgrace supported him?
               Ile tell you Madam, he since the last battell
               Sent to his father a close messenger
               To be receiu'd to grace, withall demanding
               What he should doe with those his enemies:
               Great Tarquin from his son receiues this newes,
               Being walking in his Garden, when the messenger
               Importunde him for answere, the proud king
               Lops with his wand the heads of poppies off,
               And saies no more, with this vncertain answere
               The messenger to Sextus back returnes.
               who questions of his fathers words, lookes, gesture,
               He tels him what the hawty speechles King
               Did to the heads of poppies, which bold Sextus
               
               Straight apprehends, cuts off the great mens heads,
               And hauing lest the Gabines without Gouernors,
               Flies to his father, and this day is welcom'd
               For this his trayterous seruice, by the King
               With all due solemne honours to the Court.

               Sit round the enemy is pounded fast
               In their owne folds, the wals made to oppugne,
               Hostile incursions become a prison
               To keep them fast for excution;
               Ther's no eruption to be feard.

               What shals do? come a health to the Generals health, & Valerius that sits the most ciuilly shall begin it, I cannot talke till my bloud be mingled with this bloud of grapes: Fill, for Valerius thou shouldst drinke well, for thou hast been in the German warres, if thou loust me drinke vpse freeze.

We neither feast, dance, quaffe, riot nor play.

               If one woman among so many bad, may be found good, If a white wench may proue a black swan, it is Lucrece her beauty hath relation to her vertue, and her vertue correspondence to her beautie, and in both she is fellowlesse.
