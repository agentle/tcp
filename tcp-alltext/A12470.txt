            To the Courteous Reader.
            COurteous, Kind, & indifferent Readers, whoſe willingneſſe
to reade & heare this following diſcourſe,
doth explaine to the world your hearty affection,
to the proſecuting and furtherance of ſo worthy an action:
ſo it is, that like to an vnskilfull actor, who hauing
by miſconſtruction of his right Cue, ouer-ſlipt himſelfe,
in beginning of a contrary part, and fearing the
hatefull hiſſe of the captious multitude, with a modeſt
bluſh retires himſelfe in priuate; as doubting the reprehenſion
of his whole audience in publicke, and yet againe
vpon further deliberation, thinking it better to
know their cenſures at the firſt, and vpon ſubmisſion to
reape pardon, then by ſeeking to ſmother it, to incurre
the danger of a ſecret ſcandall: Imboldening himſelfe
vpon the curteous kindneſſe of the beſt, and not greatly
reſpecting the worſt, comes fourth againe, makes an Apollogie
for himſelfe, ſhewes the cauſe of his error,
craues pardon for his raſhnes, and in fine, receiues a generall
applauditie of the whole aſſemblie: ſo I gentle
Readers, happening vpon this relation by chance (as I
take it, at the ſecond or third hand) induced thereunto
by diuers well willers of the action, and none wiſhing
better towards it then my ſelfe, ſo farre foorth as my
poore abilitie can or may ſtretch too, I thought good to
publiſh it: but the Author being abſent from the preſſe,
it cannot be doubted but that ſome faults haue eſcaped
in the printing, eſpecially in the names of Countries,

Townes, and People, which are ſomewhat ſtrange vnto
vs: but moſt of all, and which is the chiefe error, (for
want of knowledge of the Writer) ſome of the bookes
were printed vnder the name of Thomas Watſon, by
whoſe occaſion I know not, vnleſſe it were the ouer raſhneſſe,
or miſtaking of the workemen, but ſince hauing
learned that the ſaide diſcourſe was written by Captaine
Smith, who is one of the Counſell there in Virginia: I
thought good to make the like Apollogie, by ſhewing
the true Author ſo farre as my ſelfe could learne, not
doubting, but that the wiſe noting it as an error of ignorance,
will paſſe it ouer with patience, and if worthy an
applauditie, to reſerue it to the Author, whoſe paines in
my iudgement deſerueth commendations; ſomewhat
more was by him written, which being as I thought (fit
to be priuate) I would not aduenture to make it publicke
what more may be expected concerning the ſcituation of
the Country, the nature, of the clime, number of our people
there reſident, the manner of their gouernment, and
liuing, the commodities to be produced, & the end & effect
it maycome too, I can ſay nothing more then is here
written, only what I haue learned and gathered from the
generall conſent of all (that I haue conuerſed withall) aſwell
marriners as others, which haue had imploymēt that
way; is that the Country is ex
                  •
               cellēt & pleaſant, the clime
temperate and healthfull, the ground fertill and good,
the commodities to be expected (if well followed) many,
for our people, the worſt being already paſt, theſe former
hauing indured the heate of the day, whereby thoſe that
ſha
                  •
               l ſucceede, may at eaſe labour for their profit, in the
moſt ſweete, coole, and temperate ſhade: the action moſt
honorable, and the end to the high glory of God, to the
erecting of true religion among Infidells, to the ouerthrow
of ſuperſtition and idolatrie, to the winning of

many thouſands of wandring ſheepe, vnto Chriſts fold,
who now, and till now, haue ſtrayed in the vnknowne
paths of Paganiſme, Idolatrie, and ſuſperſtition: yea, I
ſay the Action being well followed, as by the graue Senators,
and worthy aduenturors, it hath beene worthily
begunne: will tend to the euerlaſting renowne of our
Nation, and to the exceeding good and benefit of our
Weale publicke in generall: whoſe Counſells, labours,
godly and induſtrious endeuours, I beſeech the mightie
Iehouah to bleſſe, proſper, and further, with his heauenly
ayde, and holy aſſiſtance.

True relation of ſuch occurrences
and accidents of note, as hath hapned in Virginia,
ſince the firſt planting of that Collony,
which is now reſident in the South part
thereof, till the laſt returne.
            
               
                  KInde Sir, commendations remembred,
&c. You ſhall vnderſtand
that after many croſſes in the downes
by tempeſts wee arriued ſafely vppon
the Southweſt part of the great Canaries:
within foure or fiue daies after
we ſet ſaile for Dominica, the 26. of
Aprill: the firſt land we made, wee fell
with Cape Henry, the verie mouth of
the Bay of Chiſſiapiacke, which at that preſent we little expected,
hauing by a cruell ſtorme bene put to the Northward:
anchoring in this Bay twentie or thirtie went a ſhore with
the Captain▪ and in comming aboard, they were aſſalted with
certaine Indians, which charged them within Piſtoll ſhot: in
which conflict, Captaine Archer and Mathew Morton were
ſhot: wherupon, Captaine Newport ſeconding them, made a
ſhot at them, which the Indians little reſpected, but hauing
ſpent their arrowes retyred without harme and in that place
was the Bar opened, wherin the Counſell for Virginia was
nonnnated: and arriuing at the place where we are now ſeated,
the Counſell was ſworne, the Preſident elected, which for
that yeare was Maiſter Edm. Maria Wingfield, where was

made choice for our ſcituation, a verie fit place for the erecting
of a great cittie, about which ſome contention paſſed betwixt
Captaine Wingfield and Captaine Goſnold, not-withſtanding
all out prouiſion was brought a ſhore, and with as
much ſpeede as might bee wee went about our fortification.
            The two and twenty day of Aprill, Captain Newport and
my ſelfe with diuers others, to the number of twenty two
perſons, ſet forward to diſcouer the Riuer, ſome fiftie or ſixtie
miles, finding it in ſome places broader, & in ſome narrower,
the Countrie (for the moſte part) on each ſide plaine high
ground, with many freſh Springes, the people in all places
kindely intreating vs, daunſing and feaſting vs with ſtrawberries,
Mulberies, Bread, Fiſh, and other their Countrie
prouiſions wherof we had plenty: for which Captaine Newport
kindely requited thei
                  •
                leaſt fauours with Bels Pinnes,
Needles, beades or Glaſſes, which ſo contented them that his
liberallitie made them follow vs from place to place, and euer
kindely to reſpect vs. In the midway ſtaying to refreſh our
ſelues in a little Ile foure or fiue ſauages came vnto vs which
deſcribed vnto vs the courſe of the Riuer, and after in our
iourney, they often met vs, trading with vs for ſuch prouiſion
as wee had, and ariuing at Ar
                     •
                  atecke, hee whom we ſuppoſed
to bee the chiefe King of all the reſt, moſte kindely entertained
vs, giuing vs in a guide to go with vs vp the Riuer to Powhatan,
of which place their great Emperor taketh his name,
where he that they honored for King vſed vs kindely. But to
finiſh this diſcouerie, we paſſed on further, where within an
ile we were interrepted with great craggy ſtones yt in midſt
of the riuer, where the water falleth ſo rudely, and with ſuch a
violence, as not any boat can poſſibly paſſe, and ſo broad diſperſeth
the ſtreame, as there is not paſt flue or ſire Foote at a
low water, and to the ſhore ſcarce paſſage with a barge, the
water floweth foure foote, and the freſhes by reaſon of the
Rockes haue left markes of the inundations 8. or 9. foote:
The ſooth ſide is plaine low ground, and the north ſide high

mountaines, the rockes being of a grauelly nature, interlace
                  •
               
with many vains of gliſtring ſpangles That night we returned
to Powhatan: the next day (being Whitſunday after dinner)
we returned to the fals, leauing a mariner in pawn with
the Indians for a guide of theirs, hee that they honoured for
King followed vs by the riuer. That afternoone we trifled in
looking vpon the Rockes and riuer (further he would not goe)
ſo there we erected acroſſe, and that night taking our man at
Powhatans, Cap. Newport congratulated his kindenes with
a Gown and a Hatchet: returning to Arſetecke, and ſtayed
there the next day to obſerue the height therof, & ſo with many
ſlgnes of loue we departed. The next day the Queene of Agamatack
kindely intreated vs, her people being no leſſe contented
then the reſt, and from thence we went to another place,
(the name whereof I doe not remember) where the people
ſhewed vs the manner of their diuing for Muſſels, in which
they finde Pearles.
            That night paſſing by Weanock ſome twentie miles from
our Fort, they according to their former churliſh condition,
ſeemed little to affect vs, but as wee departed and lodged at
the point of Weanocke, the people the next morning ſeemed
kindely to content vs, yet we might perceiue many ſignes of
a more Iealouſie in them then before, and alſo the Hinde that
the King of Arſeteck had giuen vs, altered his reſolution in
going to our Fort, and with many kinde circumſtances left
vs there. This gaue vs ſome occaſion to doubt ſome miſchiefe
at the Fort, yet Capt. Newport intended to haue viſited Paſpahegh
and Tappahanocke, but the inſtant change of the
winde being faire for our return, we repaired to the fort withall
ſpeed, where the firſt we heard was that 400. Indians the
day before had aſſalted the fort, & ſuppriſed it, had not God (beyond
al their expectations) by meanes of the ſhippes at whom
they ſhot with their Ordinances & Muskets, cauſed them to
retire, they had entred the fort with our own men, which were
then buſied in ſetting Corne, their armes beeing then in drieſats
& few ready but certain Gentlemē of their own, in which

conflict, moſt of the Counſel was hurt, a boy ſlaine in the Pinnas,
and thirteene or fourteene more hurt Withall ſpeede we
palliſadeed our Fort: (each other day) for ſixe or ſeauen daies
we had alarums by ambuſcadoes, and foure or fiue cruelly
wounded by being abroad: the Indians loſſe wee know not,
but as they report three were ſlain and diuers hurt.
            Captaine Newport hauing ſet things in order, ſet ſaile for
England the 22 of June, leauing prouiſion for 13. or 14
weeks. The day before the Ships departure, the King of Pamaun
                     •
                  e
ſent the Indian that had met vs before in our diſcouerie,
to aſſure vs peace, our fort being then paliſadoed round,
and all our men in good health and comfort, albeit, that throgh
ſome diſcentented humors, it did not ſo long continue, for the
Preſident and Captaine Goſnold, with the reſt of the Counſell,
being for the moſte part diſcontented with one another in
ſo much, that things were neither carried with that diſcretion
nor any buſines effected in ſuch good ſort as wiſdome would,
nor our owne good and ſafetie required thereby, and through
the hard dealing of our Preſident, the reſt of the counſell beeing
diuerſlie affected through his audarious commaund, and
for Captaine Martin, (albeit verie honeſt) and wiſhing the
beſt good, yet ſo ſicke and weake, and my ſelfe ſo diſgrac'd
through others mallice, through which diſorder God (being
angrie with vs) plagued vs with ſuch famin and ſicknes, that
the liuing were ſcarce able ſo bury the dead: our want of ſufficient
and good victualls, with continuall watching, foure or
fiue each night at three Bulwarkes, being the chiefe
cauſe: onely of Sturgion wee had great ſtore, whereon
our men would ſo greedily ſurfet, as it coſt manye
their liues: the Sack, Aquauitie, and other preſeruatiues for
our health, being kept onely in the Preſidents hands, for his
owne diet, and his few aſſociates: ſhortly after Captaine Goſnold
fell ſicke, and within thrée wéekes died, Captaine Ratcliffe
being then alſo verie ſicke and weake, and my ſelfe hauing
alſo taſted of the extremitie therof, but by Gods aſſiſtāce
being well recouered. Kendall about this time, for diuers

reaſons depoſed from being of the Councell: and ſhortly after
it pleaſed God (in our extremity) to moue the Indians to bring
vs Corne, ere it was halfe ripe, to refreſh vs, when we rather
expected when they would deſtroy vs: about the tenth of
September there was about 46. of our men dead, at which
time Captaine Wingefield hauing ordred the affaires in ſuch
ſort that he was generally hated of all, in which reſpect with
one conſent he was depoſed from his preſidencie, and Captaine
Ratcliffe according to his courſe was elected.
            Our prouiſion being now within twentie dayes ſpent, the
Indians brought vs great ſtore both of Corne and bread ready
made: and alſo there came ſuch aboundance of Fowles into
the Riuers as greatly refreſhed our weake eſtates, wherevppon
many of our weake men were preſently able to goe abroad.
As yet we had no houſes to couer vs, our Tents were
rotten, and our Cabbins worſe then nought: our beſt commoditie
was Yron which we made into little chiſſels, the preſident,
and Captaine Martins ſicknes, conſtrayned me to be
Cape Marchant, and yet to ſpare no paines in making houſes
for the company, who notwithſtanding our miſery, little
ceaſed their mallice, grudging and mattering. As at this time
were moſt of our chiefeſt men either ſicke or diſcontented, the
reſt being in ſuch diſpaire, as they would rather ſtarue and
rot with idlenes, then be perſwaded to do any thing for their
owne reliefe without conſtraint: our victualles being now
within eighteene dayes ſpent, and the Indians trade decreaſing,
I was ſent to the mouth of y• riuer, to Kegquouhtan an
Indian Towne, to trade for Corne, and try the riuer for Fiſh,
but our fiſhing we could not effect by reaſon of the ſtormy
weather. The Indians thinking vs neare famiſhed, with
careleſſe kindnes, offred vs little pieces of bread, & ſmall handfulls
of beanes or wheat, for a hatchet or a piece of copper: In
the like maner I entertained their kindnes, and in like ſcorne
offered them like commodities, but the Children, or any that
ſhewed extraordinary kindenes, I liberally contented with
free gifte, ſuch trifles as wel cōtented them▪ finding this co
                  ••
               e

comfort, I anchored before the Towne, and the next day returned
to trade, but God (the abſolute diſpoſer of all heartes)
altered their conceits, for now they were no leſſe deſirous of
cut commodities then we of their Corne: vnder colour to
fetch freſh water, I ſent a man to diſcouer the Towne,
their Corne, and force, to trie their intent, in that they deſired
me vp to their houſes: which well vnderſtanding, with
foure ſhot I viſited them, with fiſh, oyſters, bread and déere,
they kindly trades with me and my men, beeing no leſſe in
doubt of my intent, then I of theirs, for well I might with
twentie men haue fraighted a Shippe with Corne: The
Towne conteineth eighteene houſes, pleaſantly ſeated vpon
three acres of ground, vppon a plaine, halfe inuironed with
a great Bay of the great Riuer, the other parte with a Baye
of the other Riuer falling into the great Baye, with a little
Ile fit for a Caſtle in the mouth thereof, the Towne
adioyning to the mains by a necke of Land of ſixtie yardes.
With ſixteene buſhells of Corne I returned towards our
Forte: by the way I encountred with two Canowes of Indians,
who came ab
                  •
               ord me, being the inhabitants of waroſkoyack,
a kingdome on the ſouth ſide of the riuer, which is in
breadth 5. miles and 20 mile or neare from the mouth: with
theſe I traded, who hauing but their hunting prouiſion, requeſted
me to returne to their Towne, where I ſhould load
my boat with corne, & with near thirtie buſhells I returned to
the fort, the very name wherof gaue great comfort to our deſparing
company: time thus paſſing away, & hauing not aboue
14. daies vituals left, ſome motiōs were made about our preſidents
& Capt. Archeri going for England, to procure a ſupply,
in which meane time we had reaſonablly fitted vs with
houſes, and our Preſident & Capt. Martin being able to walk
abroad, with much ado do it was concluded, that the pinnace and
barge ſhould goe towards Powhatan, to trade for corne: Letts
were caſt who ſhould go in her, the chance was mine, & while
ſhe was arigging. I made a voiage to Topohanack, where ariuing,
there was but certain women & children who fled from
their houſes, yet at laſt I drew them to draw néere, truck they

durſt not, corne they had plenty, & to ſpoile I had no cōmiſſion:
In my reſume to Paſpahegh, I traded with that churliſh &
trecherous nation: hauing loaded 10 or 12 buſhels of corne,
they offred to take our pieces and ſwords, yet by ſtelth, but ſéeming
to diſlike it, they were ready to aſſault vs, yet ſtāding vpon
our guard in coaſting the ſhore, diuers out of the woods
would meet with vs with corn & trade, but leaſt we ſhould be
conſtrained, either to indure ouermuch wrong or directly fal to
reuenge, ſéeing them dog vs, from place to place, it being night,
& our neceſſitie not fit for warres, we tooke occaſion to returne
with 10 buſhells of corne: Cap. Martin after made 2 iournies
to that nation of Paſpahegh but eache tune returned with 8.
or 10. buſhells. All things being now ready for my iourney to
Powhatan, for the performance thereof, I had 8. men and my
ſelfe for the barge, as well for diſcouerie, as trading, the Pinnace,
5. Marriners, & 2. landmen to take in out ladings at conuenient
places. The 9 of Nouember I ſet forward for the diſcouery
of the country of Chikhamania, leauing the pinnace
the next tide to followe and ſtay for my comming at Point
weanock, 20 miles from our fort: the mouth of this riuer falleth
into the great riuer at Paſpahegh, 8 miles aboue our fort:
that afternoone I ſtayed the eb, in the bay of Paſpahegh with
the Indiās: towards the euening certaine Indians haled me,
one of them being of Chikahamania, offred to cōduct me to his
country, the Paſpabegheans grudged therat: along we went
by moonelight, at midnight he brought vs before his Towne,
deſiring one of our men to go vp with him, whom he kindely
intertained, and returned back to the barge: the next morning
I went vp to the towne, and ſhewed them what copper and
hatchets they ſhold haue for corne, each family ſeeking to giue
me moſt content: ſo long they cauſed me to ſtay yt 100 at leaſt
was expecting my comming by the riuer with corne, what I
liked I bought, and leaſt they ſhould perceiue my too great
want I went higher vp the riuer: this place is called Manoſquoſick
a quarter of a mile from the riuer, conteining thirtie
or fortie houſes, vppon an exceeding high land: at the foote
of the hill towards the riuer, is a plaine wood, watered
with many ſpringes, which fall twentie yardes right downe

into the riuer: right againſt yt ſame is a great marſh, of 4. or 5.
miles circuit, deuided in 2 Ilands, by the parting of the riuer,
abounding with fiſh & fouls all ſorts a mile from thence is a
Towne called Oraniocke, I further diſcouered the Townes
of M
                     •
                  nſa, Apahaock, Werawahone, & Mamanahūt at eche
place kindely vſed, eſpecially at the laſt, being the hart of the
Country, where were aſſembled 200. people with ſuch aboū
               dāce
of corne, as hauing laded our barge, as alſo I might haue
laded a ſhip: I returned to Paſpahhegh, & conſidering yt want
of Corne at our Fort, it being night, with yt ebb, by midnight
I ariued at our fort, where I found our Pinnis run aground:
the next morning I vnladed ſeauē hogſheds into our ſtore, the
next morning I returned againe: the ſecond day I ariued at
Mamanahūt, wher y• people hauing heard of my cōming, were
ready with 3 or 400. baskets litle & great, of which hauing laded
my barge, with many ſignes of great kindnes I returned:
at my departure they requeſted me to hear our pieces, being in
the midſt of the riuer, which in regard of y• eccho ſéemed a peale
of ordnance, many birds and fowles they ſee vs dayly kil that
much feared them, ſo deſirous of trade wer they, yt they would
follow me with their canowes, & for any thing giue it me, rather
then returne it back: ſo I vnladed again 7 or 8. hogſheads
at our fort. Hauing thus by Gods aſſiſtance gotten good ſtore
of corne, notwithſtanding ſome bad ſpirrits not content with
Gods prouidence, ſtill grew 
                  •••
               tinous, in ſo much, that our
preſident hauing ocaſion to chide the ſ
                  •
               ith for his miſdeamenor,
he not only gaue him bad language, but alſo offred to ſtrike
him with ſome of his tooles, for which rebellious act, the smith
was by a Jury condemned to be hanged, but being vppon the
ladder continuing verry obſtinate, as hoping vpon a reſcue:
when he ſaw no other way but death with him, he became penitent,
& declared a dangerous conſpiracy, for which Captains
Kendall as principal, was by a Jury condē
               
                  •
               ed & ſhot to death.
This conſpiracy appeaſed, I ſet forward for the diſcouery of
the Riuer of Checka Hamania: this third time I diſcouered y•
Townes of Matapamient, Morinogh, Aſcacap, moyſenock
Righkahauck, Nechanichock, Mattalūt, Attamuſpincke, &
diuers others, their plenty of corne I found decreaſed, yet lading

the barge, I returned to our fort: our ſtore being now
indifferently wel prouided with corne, there was much adoe
for to haue the pinace goe for England, againſt which Captain
Martin & my ſelfe, ſtanding chiefly againſt it, and in fine after
many debatings, pro & contra, it was reolued to ſtay a 
                  •
               urther
reſolutiō: this matter alſo quieted, I ſet forward to finiſh
this diſcouery, which as yet I had neglected in regard of y• neceſſitie
we had to take in prouiſion whilſt it was to be had: 4
                  •
               .
miles I paſſed vp yt riuer, which for the moſt part is a quarter
of a mile broad, & 3. fatham & a half deep, exceeding vſey, many
great low marſhes, & many high lāds, eſpecially about yt midſt
at a place called Moyſonicke, a Peninſule of 4. miles cicuit,
betwixt two riuers ioyned to the main, by a neck of 40. or 50.
yards, and 40. or 50 yards from the high water marke: on both
ſides in the very necke of the maine, are high hills and dales,
yet much inhabited, the Ile declining in a plaine fertile corn
                  •
               
field, the lower end a low marſh, more plentie of ſwannes,
cranes, geeſe, duckes, and mallards, & diuers ſorts of fowles
none would deſire: more plaine fertile planted ground, in ſuch
great proportions as there I had not ſeene, of a light blacke
ſandy mould, the cliffes commonly red, white and yellowe coloured
ſand, & vnder red & white clay, fiſh great plenty, & people
aboundance, the moſt of their inhabitants, in view of yt neck of
Land, where a better ſeat for a towne cannot be deſired: at the
end of forty miles this riuer inuironeth many low Ilands, at
each high water drowned for a mile, where it vniteth it ſelfe,
at a place called. Apokant the higheſt Towns inhabited. 10.
miles higher I diſcouered with the barge; in the mid way, a
great tree hindred my paſſage which I cut in two: heere the riuer
became narrower, 8. 9 or 10. foote at a high water, and 6.
or 7. at a lowe: the ſtreame exceeding ſwift, & the bottom hard
channell, the ground moſt part of a low plaine, ſandy ſoyle, this
occaſioned me to ſuppoſe it might iſſue from ſome lake or ſome
broad ford, for it could not be far the head, but rather then I
would endanger the barge, yet to haue beene able to reſolue
this doubt, & to diſcharge the imputation of malicious tungs,

hauing feaſted me, he further led me to another branch of the riuer,
called Mattapament, to ſwo other hunting townes they
led me, and to each of theſe Countries, a houſe of the great Emperour
of Pewhakan, whom as yet I ſuppoſed to bee at the
Fals, to him I tolde him I muſt goe, and to returne to Paſpahegh,
after this foure or fiue dayes marſh, we returned to Raſawrack,
the firſt towne they brought me too, where binding
the Mats in bundels, they marched two dayes iourney, and
croſſed the Riuer of Youghtanan, where it was as broad as
Thames: ſo conducting me to a place called Menapacute in
Pamaunke, where ye King inhabited: the next day another King
of that nation called Kekataugh, hauing receiued ſome kindnes
of me at the Fort, kindly inuited me to feaſt at his houſe, the people
from all places flocked to ſée me, each ſhewing to content
me. By this the great King hath foure or fiue houſes, each
containing foureſcore or an hundred foote in length, pleaſantly
ſeated vpon an high ſandy hill, from whence you may ſée weſterly
a goodly low Country, the riuer before the which his crooked
courſe cauſeth many great Marſhes of excéeding good ground.
An hundred houſes, and many large plaines are here togither
inhabited more abundance of fiſhe fowle, and a pleaſanter ſeat

though a chaunce ſuppoſed.
            From hence this kind King conducted mee to a place called
Topahanocke, a kingdome vpon another Riuer northward:
the cauſe of this was, that the yeare before, a ſhippe had béene
in the Riuer of Pamaunke, who hauing beene kindly entertained
by Powhatan their Emperour, they returned thence, and
diſcouered the Riuer of Topahanocke, where being receiued

Countreys beyonde the Falles, with many of the reſt, confirming
what not onely Opechancanoyes, and an Indian
which had beene proſoner to Pewhatan had before tolde mee,
but ſome called it fiue dayes, ſome ſixe, ſome eight, where the

deſcribed alſo vpon the ſame Sea, a mighty Nation called
Pocoughtronack, a fierce Nation that did eate men, and
warred with the people of Moyaoncer, and Pataromerke,
Nations vpon the toppe or the heade of the Bay, vnder his
territories, where the yeare before they had ſlein an hundred,

Sléeues to the Elbowes, that paſſed that way in Shippes
like ours. Many Kingdomes hée deſcribed mée to the heade

from mightie Mountaines betwixt the two Seas, the people
cloathed at Ocamahowan. He alſo confirmed, and the Southerly

called Anone, where they haue abundance of Braſſe,
and houſes walled as outs. I required his diſcourſe, ſeeing
what pride hée had in his great and ſpacious Dominions,
ſeeing that all hee knewe were vnder his Territories.
            
               
In deſcribing to him the territorles of Europe, which was
ſubiect to our great King whoſe ſubiect I was, the innumerable
multitude of his ſhips, I gaue him to vnderſtand the noyſe of
Trumpets, and terrible manner of fighting were vnder captain
Newport my father, whom I intituled the Meworames which
they call King of all the waters, at his greatneſſe hee admired,
and not a little feared: hee deſired mee to forſake Paſpaliegh,

Howaſicke: hée promiſed to giue me Corne, Veniſon, or what
I wanted to feede vs, Hatchets and Copper wee ſhould make

ſought to content me: hee ſent me home with 4. men, one
that vſually carried my Gowne and Knapſacke after me, two
other loded with bread, and one to accompanie me.

low grounds and mariſhes, but inhabited with aboundance of
warlike and tall people. The Countrey of Youghtomam, of
no leſſe worth, onely it is lower, but all the ſoyle, a fatte, fertill,
ſandie ground. Aboue Manapacumter, many high ſandie
Mountaines. By the Riuer is many Rockes, ſeeming if not of

lower, and a white ſandle, and a white clay ſoyle: here is their
beſt Terra Sigillata: The month of the Riuer, as I ſee in the

Their religion and Ceremonie I obſerued was thus: thrée
or foure dayes after my taking ſeuen of them in the houſe where
I lay, each with a rattle began at ten a clocke in the morning to
ſing about the fire, which they inuironed with a Circle of
meale, and after a foote or two from that, at the end of each ſong,
layde downe two or thrée graines of wheate, continuing this order
till they haue included ſixe or ſeuen hundred in a halfe Circle,
and after that two or thrée more Circles in like maner, a hand
bredth from other: that done, at each ſong, they put betwixt euerie
three, two or fiue graines, a little ſlicke, ſo counting as an
old woman her Pater noſter.

with ſtrange and vehement actions, great cakes of Déere
ſuet, Deare, and Tobacco he caſteth in the fire, till ſixe a clocke
in the Euening, their howling would continue ere they would
depart. Each morning in the coldeſt froſt, the principall to the
number of twentie or thirtie, aſſembled themſelues in a round
circle, a good diſtance from the towne, where they told me they
there conſulted where to hunt the next day: ſo fat they fed nice,
that I much doubted they intended to haue ſacrificed mee to the
Quiyoughquoſicke, which is a ſuperiour power they worſhip,
a more vglier thing cannot be deſcribed: one they haue for
chief ſacrifices, which alſo they call Quiyoughquoſick: to cure
the ſick, a man with a Rattle, and extreame howling, ſhowting,
singing, and ſuch violent geſtures, and Anticke actions ouer
the patient will ſucke out blood and flegme from the patient out
of their vnable ſtomacke, or any diſeaſed place, as no labour will
more tire them, Tobacco they offer the water in paſſing in fowle
weather. The death of any they lament with great ſorrow and
weeping: their Kings they burie betwixt two mattes within
their houſes, with all his beads, tewels, hatchets, and copper: the
other in graues like ours. They acknowledge no reſurrection.
Powhatan hath thrée brethren, and two ſiſters, each of his bretheren

ſuccéeded other.
            For the Crowne, their heyres inverite not, but the firſt
heyres of the Siſters, and ſo ſucceſſiuely the weomens heires:
For the Kings haue as many weomen as they will, his Subiects
two, and moſt but one.
            From Weramocomoco is but 12. miles, yet the Indians
trifled away that day, and would not goe to our Forte by any
perſwaſions: but to certaine olde hunting houſes of Paſpahegh
we lodged all night. The next morning ere Sunne riſe,
we ſet forward for our Fort, where we arriued within an houre,
where each man with the trueſt signes of ioy they could expreſſe
welcommed mee, except M. Archer, and ſome 2. or 3. of his,
who was then in my abſence, ſworne Counſellour, though not
with the conſent of Captaine Martin: great blame and imputation
was laide vpon mée by them, for the loſſe of our two men
which the Indians ſlew: inſo much that they purpoſed to depoſe
me, but in the midſt of my miſeries, it pleaſed God to ſend Captaine
Nuport, who arriuing there the ſame night, ſo tripled our
ioy, as for a while theſe plots againſt me were deferred though
with much malies againſt me, which captain Newport in ſhort
time did plainly ſee. Now was maiſter Scriuener, captaine
Martin, and my ſelfe, called Counſ

               llers.
            Within fiue or ſixe dayes after the arriuall of the Ship, by a
miſchaunce our Fort was burned and the moſt of our apparell,
lodging and priuate prouiſion, many of our old men diſeaſed,
and of our new for want of lodging periſhed. The Empercur
Powhatan each wéeke once or twice ſent me many presents of
Deare, bread Raugroughcuns, halfe alwayes for my father,
whom he much deſired to ſée, and halfe for me: and ſo continually
importuned by meſſengers and preſents, that I would come to
fetch the corne, and take the Countrie their King had giuen me,
as at laſt Captaine Newport reſolued to go ſee him. Such
acquaintance I had amongſt the Indians, 
               
                  •
               and ſuch confidence
they had in me, as neare the Fort they would not come till I
came to them, euery of them calling me by my name, would not
ſell any thing till I had firſt receiued their preſents, and what

they had that I liked, they deferred ſo my diſcreſion: but after
acquaintance, they vſually came into the Fort at their pleasure:
The Preſident, and the reſt of the Councell, they kenew
not, but Captaine Newports greatneſſe I had ſo deſcribed, as
they conceyued him the chiefe, the reſt his children, Officers, and
ſeruants. We had agreed with yt king of Paſpahegh to conduct
two of our men to a place called Panawicke beyond R

where he reported many men to be apparelled. Wee lended
him at Warraskoyack, where playing the villaine, and deluding
vs for rewards, returned within thrée or foure dayes after
without going further. Captaine Newport, maiſter Scrinener,
and my ſelfe, found the mouth of Pamauncks riuer, ſome
25. or 30. miles northward from Cape Henricke, the chanell
good as before expreſſed.
            Arriuing at Weramocomoca, being iealous of the intent of
this politick ſaluage, to diſcouer his intent the better, I with 20.

diuerſe others of his chiefe men conducted me to their kings habitation,
but in the mid way I was intercepted by a great créek
ouer which they had made a bridge of grained ſtakes & ratles,
the king of Kiskieck, and Namontack, who all the iourney the

cauſed me to ſuſpect ſome miſchiefe: the barge I had ſent to méet

the Kings ſonne, our conductors, and his chiefe men
amongſt ours, and led forward, leauing halfe at the one ende
to make a guard for the paſſage of the Front. The Indians
ſeeing the weakeneſſe of the Bridge, came with a Canow, and
tooke me in of the middeſt with foure or flue more, bring landed

and a Hatte, as Jewels he eſtéemed them, and with a great
Oration made by thrée of his Nobles, if there be any amongſt
Saluages, kindly accepted them, with a publike confirmation
of a perpetuall league and friendſhip.
            After that, he commaunded the Quéen

this purpoſe. Your kinde viſitation doth much content mee,
but where is your father whom I much deſire to ſee, is he not
with you. I told him he remained aboord, but the next day he
would come vnto him, with a merrie coūtenance he aſked me for
certaine péeces I which promiſed him, when I went to Paſpahegh,
I told according to my promiſe, that I proffered the man

alowde laughter, he deſired to giue him ſome of leſſe burthen,

carrie them: but where are theſe men you promiſed to come
with you, I told him without, who thervpon gaue order to hau

them brought in, two after two, euer mainteining the guard
without. And as they preſented themſelues euer with thankes,
he would ſainte me, and cauſed each of them to haue foure or fiue
pound of bread giuen them. This done, I aſked him for the
corne and ground he promiſed me He told me I ſhould haue it,
but he expected to haue all theſe men lay their armes at his féet,
as did his ſubiects. I tolde him that was a ceremonie our enemies

deſired, but neuer our Friends, as we preſented our
ſelues vnto him, yet that he ſhould

            This ſo contented him, as immediatly with attentiue ſilence,
with a lowd oration he proclaimed me Awerowanes
of Powhaton, and that all his ſubiects ſhould so eſtéeme vs,
and no man account vs ſtrangers nor Paſpaheghans, but
Powhatans, and that the Corne, weomen and Country,
ſhould be to vs as to his owne people: this proffered kindnes
for many reaſons we contemned not, but with the beſt
Languages and ſignes of thankes I could expreſſe, I tooke
my leaue.
            The King riſing from his ſeat, conducted me foorth, and
cauſed each of my men to haue as much more bread as hée
could beare: giuing me ſome in a baſket, & as much he ſent
a board for a preſent to my Father: victuals you muſt know
is all there wealth, and the greateſt kindnes they could ſhew
vs: arriuing at the Riuer, the Barge was fallen ſo low with
the ebbe, though I had giuen order and oft ſent to preuent
the ſame, yet the meſſengers deceiued mée, the Skies being
very thicke and rainie, the King vnderſtanding this miſchance,
ſent his Sonne and Mamontacke, to conduct mée
to a great houſe ſufficient to lodge mée, where entring I ſaw
it hung round with bowes and arrowes.
            The Indians vſed all diligence to make vs fires, & giue
vs content: the kings Orators preſently entertained vs
with a kinde oration, with expreſſe charge that not any
ſhould ſteale, or take out bowes or arrowes, or offer any
iniury.

all night. To my ſupper he ſet before me meate for twenty
men, & ſeeing I could not eate, hee cauſed it to be giuen to my
men: for this is a generall cuſtome, that what they giue, not
to take againe, but you moſt either eate it, giue it away, or

my lodging.
            The next day the King conducting mée to the Riuer,
ſhewed me his Canawes, and deſcribed vnto me how hée

who after his old manner kindly receiued him, eſpecially a
Boy of thirtéen yeeres old, called Thomas Saluage, whom

            Why we came armed in that ſort, ſéeing hée was our
friend, and had neither bowes nor arrowes, what did wée
doubt? I told him it was the cuſtome of our Country, not
doubting of his kindnes any waies, wherewith though hée
ſéemed ſatiſfied, yet Captaine Nuport cauſed all our men to

haue ſatiſfied that requeſt, yet twentie or twentie five ſhot

take any thing they can ceaze off, onely the people of Pamaunke,
wee haue not found ſtealing: but what others
can ſteale, their King receiueth.

ſéemed to defend what they could catch but out of our

euen till that preſent, not béene contradicted, eſpecially them
of Paſpahegh: theſe Indians within one houre, hauing by
other Saluages, then in the Fort, vnderſtood that I threatned
to be reuenged, came preſently of themſelues, and fell
to working vpon our wears, which were then in hand by other
Saluages, who ſéeing their pride ſo incountred, were ſo
