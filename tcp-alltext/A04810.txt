                I thinke that these dreadful days and miserable cōflictes, whiche we fele presently, mighte be allowed for a sufficient testimonye. And yet to beholde the course of thinges, both past and presentlye

a workinge, it moueth me oft tymes to muse, when I se the strāge diuersitie of estates, howe that in sundry respectes, the one maye be accompted very pleasante & easye in comparison of the other.
            As, if we consider the vnquiet, restles, & slydinge estate of those in high auctoritie (who yet semeth to haue most felicitie) and then the happy, quiete, & peaceable estate of them, who (for the basse estimacion they bee in) semeth of all men to be moste vnfortunate. And euen thys is thesame, whiche soo oft tymes maketh me to thyncke, (sadly sittinge some tyme alone) Howe well at ease they be, which haue drawen too them selfes the luckye lot of contentatiō of mynd in the myddest of their porest pouertie, and how vnhappely ye residue runne, who, beinge in lowe degree, will trauell to be in hygh

auctoritie, in seking wherof they rather procure their ill hap, by obtayning their desire, then wāting their welthes, by remayninge as they were.
            But now at the laste when I saw no ende of climming vp, and in suche number also, yt they daily fall doune by ruthfull heapes, taking vnrecouerable fals to their vtter vndowing: And besides all this to the farther increase of my admiracion, that other by seinge their present harme can not auoid their slippery steppes to prolong their owne prosperitie, but wilfully (as it were) to tumble doun the tree after theym: And yet I speake nothing of that, how by secret shuldring, ech pussheth other, I wot not howe, from his place, but so daungerously, as I mai sai in secrete, it passeth playinge in pastyme: but now to make rehersed

me, and not that I thoughte ye dowinge therof to be so exquisite, but because suche profit thereby vnto me insuede, that me semeth I must nedes confesse it.
            But now, callinge to remembraunce what trauell and studye some of your honoures and worshippes haue taken in the wayghtie affayers of the realme of Englande, when you were thoughte mete too beare rule, howe so euer thinges happened now and then to succede: I thinke thesame of euery faythfull subiecte thus yet to be considered, as lamentynge the yll with hope of redresse, so for those good thinges, by youre trauels then enioyed, our humble thankes still to remayne, though, thorow the tyrannye of tyrantes, the benefit be withdrawen.
            For as frendship, beinge commendable in men of equalitie, is

yet more laudable in the honorable or worshipful, that can be contented to extende thesame too the simple poore man: Euen so he (vpon whome suche frendship is bestowed) not to expresse by such ways as he is able, his faithful & thankefull harte, thesame man, if my iudgemente fayle not, dealeth not onely vnnaturally, but deserueth, as he is well worthy, too be sharpely reprehended.
            In consideraciō wherof it mai please your honors and worships to vnderstand, yt I haue thought it a parte of my duetye, too offre vnto you this simple seyng glasse folowinge, in the which (I wene) maye be discerned, both the estate of the mightie and meane man, what a hudge heappe of endles troubles alwayes accompanieth the one: and the great quietnes yt is lost by leauing the other.

            But as touching the premisses, it woulde here bee noted, that I haue not spoken it to the derogacion of common auctoritie, neyther would I thereby discourage (if my wordes were of power to perswade) anye man, that were ordinarely called to beare rule, seynge I must nedes confesse thesame too bee of suche force by thee infallyble prouydence

The Fox and the Gote descended both in to a depe pitie, from whence they coulde not get forthe agayne, the Fox beinge a craftie and subtil beaste, ye know (as the mooste parte of the cleargie be) desyreth the Gote that he might step vp vpō his backe, & so to get out of ye pit, promisinge the Gote y• he wil draw him out after him,

But saith the Fox: Ah Gote, Gote, if thou haddest had so much witte in thy headde as thou haste heyre in thy bearde, thou wouldeste not haue gone doune, excepte thou haddest knowen howe too haue gotten vp agayne.
            Nowe that the two foted Fox is escaped out of the pyt, and that you noble men of England haue (with the Gote) set bothe backe & shulders too his liftinge vp, it is most euident: for the filthe of his tayle and fete hath all to be stayned your clothes.

                as the .26. of his prophesie doeth notablye declare. I thinke verelye, the dreadfull dayes draweth on a pase, that as Ieremi sat pitifully, beholding the miserable desolatiō that came vpon the Iewes, for their stubborne infidelitie and murthering of goddes Prophetes: Euen so you that by goddes prouidence shall eskape the cruell slaughter, nowe put in practise, shall behold Englād, and saye with him: alas, howe lieth that lande soo waste, whiche some time was ful of people: how is she becom like a widdow, that was some time ye flour of all nations? howe is she nowe broughte vnder tribute, whiche some tyme ruled all landes &c.

But me thinks I heare one busye speaking alreadi, and saieth: Sir, from whence came you? are ye a Prophet? how know you yt these thinges shall happen?
            Forsouthe Sir saye I, by thys I am more then halfe assuredlye perswaded. I fynde, that as God is eternall, euerlasting, almightie, and immutable, so is he a God that hath no respect of persons, who vseth his iustice vniuersallye vpon all wilfull offenders.
