                  Of ſapyence ſyth fyrſt reygned nature
                  My purpoſe is to tell as wryten clerkes
                  And ſpecyally her mooſt notable cure
                  In my fyrſt boke I wyll preche and depure
                  It is ſo pleaſaunt vnto eche perſone
                  That it a boke ſhall occupye alone
               
               
                  Soone after this I ſhall wyſedome deſcryue
                  Her bleſſyd houſholde / and her dwellynge place
                  And than retourne vnto her actes blyue
                  And ſhe them wrought by tyme / proceſſe & ſpace
                  All this mater ſhe taught me of her grace
                  I ſpake with her / as ye may here and rede
                  For in my dreme I mette her in a mede

                  O gylted goddes gaye and gloryous
                  Enſpyred with the percynge influence
                  Of delycate heuenly complacence
                  Within my mouth let dyſtyll of thy ſhoures
                  And forge my tonge to gladde myn audytoures

                  And with the dewe of heuen thou them degoute
                  So that my mouth may blowe & encenſe oute
                  The redolent dulcour aromatyke

                  Why ſholde I not than haue a ſoueraynte
                  And complement of my petycyon
                  Than anſwered trouth / for ye aſke no reaſon

For ſhe ne ſpared for hote / ne for colde

And of ye Iuſt maūdement made full Iuſt trāſgreſſe
                  Wherfore of ryght me thynketh he muſt be deed
                  Let be quod peas / that is a cruell dede
               
               
                  And with that worde peas came in to the place
                  Whoſe perſone was patron of portature
                  Her roſy lyppes with chere full of grace

                  Phebus hymſelfe with all his bemed cure

                  And ſayd to trouth / O ryght how may this mene
                  Is your purpoſe peas for to exyle

                  And to ordeyne deth for to reygne as quene
                  This wolde no more / but for to depryue expreſſe
                  My faders realme / and his ſouerayne rycheſſe
               
               
                  Syth euery realme that hath dyuyſyon
                  Within hymſelfe muſt nedes be deſolate
                  And we ben foure for one concluſyon
                  For to ſuſteyne the realme and his eſtate
                  Amonge vs foure / why ſholde than be debate
                  And ſyth that lawe wyll rather leſſen peyne
                  That it extende / let peas and mercy reygne
               
               
                  My faders realme debate ſuffreth no whyle
                  It is of reſt and of tranquyllyte
                  Bycauſe of whiche he wryteth in his ſtyle
                  The prynce of peas / the auctour of pyte
                  Kynge of mercy / and lorde of all bounte
                  Thus nede of force muſt peas reygne & preuayle
                  
                     
Thefe ſtryfe and debate peryſſhe in all batayle
               
               
                  The chefe auaunt and commendacyon
                  Of this hyghe realme is for it is of pees
                  Than wherto make ye dyſputacyon
                  Contraryous ben your debate / and rees
                  With ſtryfe I wyll not dwell withouten lees
                  And yf debate me from this realme dyſſeuer
                  The londe of peas deſtroyed is for euer
               
               
                  But ſyth ſo is / there is a treſpaſſe done
                  Vnto mercy let yelde the treſpaſſour
                  It is her offyce to redreſſe it ſoone
                  For treſpaſſe is to mercy a myrrour
                  And ryght as ſwete hath his apryce by ſoure
                  So by treſpaſſe mercy hath all her myght
                  Without treſpaſſe mercy hath lacke of lyght
               
               
                  What ſholde be ſyke / but yf that ſykenes were
                  What nedeth ſalue / but yf there were a ſore
                  What nedeth drynke there thyrſte hath no powere
                  What ſholde mercy / but treſpaſſe go before
                  But treſpaſſe by mercy were lytell ſtore
                  Without treſpaſſe none execucyon
                  May mercy haue / ne yet perfeccyon
               
               
                  But ſyſter trouth / ye may reygne as a prynceſſe
                  Without falſhode / and haue your ſoueraynte
                  Without Iniure / and ſo may ryghtwyſeneſſe
                  Eke without warre I peas may alwaye be
                  But mercy kyndely hath no properte
                  Withouten treſpaſſe / of whiche ſhe hath her myght
                  Ryght as the ſonne the mone gyueth all theyr lyght
               
               
                  Therfore I rede as for concluſyon
                  
                     
That we obey mercy with one accorde
                  And that we leue all our dyſcencyon
                  For lytell thynges as clerkes bere recorde
                  With peas groweth & grete thynge with dyſcorde
                  Wyteth awaye / therfore let pacyfye
                  Our luſt to one / and fall we to mercy
               
               
                  Let be quod trouth to you I nyll aſſent
                  No more wyll I ywys / quod ryghtwyſenes
                  And with that worde / trouth to her fader went
                  And thus ſhe ſayd / O grounde of ſtedfaſtnes

                  Holde thy beheſt / and ſupporte veryte

                  How ſoone thy ſeruaunt luſt to the offende
                  And how he was cruell / fals / and vnkynde
                  To thy beheſt I muſt of ryght attende
                  And nede of force to Iugement condeſcende
                  Wherfore I gyue ſentence dyffynytyue
                  In fourme foreſayd that payne to deth hym dryue
               
               
                  Of this proceſſe to haue the true entent
                  I wyll thou wete quod ſapyence to me

In one god regnaunt / and perſones thre
