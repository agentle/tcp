King Pharao, he helde the Israelites long in captiuitye: The Philistines vanquished them ofte in battaile: Nabuchodonosor banished them out of their Countrey: And Antiochus slew the people of god most lamentablye in the holye Temple, offering them vp euen vpon the verye aulters for a sacrifice to their Idols. Euen as therfore by reason of this destruction of Gods people, and decaye of all good and godly thinges, Moses, Samuel, Tobias, Mathathias, and a number of other good men made continuall mone and lamentacion: So were it very hard for vs, seing so many most constant men of god, partly in great hazarde and daunger, and part moste miserablye wounded, lifting their handes vp to the heauens: Not to haue oure hartes dieplie perced therwithall, and to sighe and grone to our selfes for their so great calamities. Which as we do now but onelye heare of, so may we perhappes feele them ere it be longe our selues. You are not ignoraunt, howe that we are but verye

Wherefore seing our enemies, and those so nighe, so cruell, and so bloudy, doe beginne as you would saye to thunder and lighten a fresh, I can not but tremble & quake for feare. For howe will they spoile other Nations trowe you, that so willingly spill their owne peoples bloud?

Moreouer thys same great Potentate of Roome, hath ordered the matter so, that he hath brought and conueyed vnto hym selfe the fruytes, profittes, dignities, prefermentes

and promotions of all quarters of the world, which he doth verye liberallye dispose amonge his adherentes, wher withall they being so largely rewarded and benefited, can not but honour so good a benefactour, hang al together on his sleeue, cleaue to him lyke burres, and rather hee content to loose their lifes, then forgo so great commodities: There may be added hereunto a thirde cause (which is also very much materiall) how that the Sea of Roome geueth oute great store of pardons, and graunteth almost a free liberty both to saye and doe all maner of euill: and as for mens maners there is small hede or regard taken therto.

               First of all this same Monarchy, or rather. Hierarchye, The goue ment of a Priest. if it tooke: beginning of Peter, it muste nedes haue bene ones settled in

his person. Let vs therfore resort to the holy Scriptures, and by them examine Peters aucthority. S. Paule calles him as he doth also Iames and Iohn, a piller of the Church. And as for the rest of his felowe Apostles, they ascribe vnto him no maner of specyall name or prerogatiue aboue the rest. Yea, but (saye they) our Lorde Iesus Christ vsed hym very louingly and familiarly. I graunt that, but so as he did the like to Iames, and much more to Iohn. And in planting of the Churche (whiche point the Romish Doctours take to be their chief holde) Peter is for no other cause specially and by name spoken to, but for that he alone in the name of his felowes had made answere to that our Sauiour demaunded of all the rest of thapostles as wel as of him. And as for the rest of our Sauiours talke concerning the Rocke, where against the gates of hell should not preuaile, it prooueth no special preemynence to be in Peter more then in the rest, but betokeneth the publick profession of our faith that should be in the Church of Christ. Which opinion and interpretacyon the auncyent Fathers haue left to vs in writinge. And if so be it were not true, our most louing sauiour

would not in the selfe same communication, haue so sharplye rebuked Peter calling him Sathan, and reprouing his ignoraunce in the Scriptures. But why do we argue in a matter that is out of all doubte? howe ofte is it repeated in holye wrytte, that God hath no respecte of persons? but if thys oppinion of the Romishe Deuynes be allowed, not onelye Peter shoulde be highly aduaūced aboue al his felowes, but also he alone should haue a celestial prerogatiue of goddes power, an inuincible faith and an aucthoritie not to be spokē against. Peters cōpanions neuer acknowledged this great authoritie.
               Peter hym selfe, neuer chalenged so strange a dignitye. Paule commending vnto our prayers, Christian magistrates, placeth first Kinges, and then Rulers. Peter framing our life with holesome doctrine, willeth vs firste, to feare god, & next him honour the king. Why nameth not he hym selfe who was already vested in his dignity? Why speaketh not he of his successours, the Bisshoppes of Roome? For if he shoulde so haue done, it could haue semed no pride in him, for so much as he might do it, by the institucion and ordinaunce of oure

sauiour. But of this extraordinary iurisdiction, was no mention made in the beginninge of the primatiue Churche. Likewise, not a word spoken of it a lōg time after. For at those daies ye Emperors of Roome shrewdly persecuted the church of Christ, & also some of the Bisshops of Roome they slue, who were in that time chief spectacles of godlines, & occupied in all holy exercises, & besides valiaunt witnesses of the death and resurrection of our sauiour Iesus Christ. For the churche of Roome had not suche an hard hap as to haue no commendable Bishoppes in it, amonge whom we confesse some of theym in deede, of auntient tyme, were excellente, and singuler fathers. And as long as that simple and innocent age endured with out pride, and ambition, so longe was that Popish gouernement vnknowen, so longe the Byshoppe of Roome coueted no especiall dignity aboue the rest, except perhaps because he was an example of the flocke, he sought to win the crowne of Martirdome from them. Wherof Gregory may be a very good witnes, who pronounceth that Bishop of Roome accursed, who wil take vpon him to be called the vniuersal prelate of

the whole church. Such was ye modestie of men in those daies. Mary by proces of time vice grew, & when as by the prouidēce of god, ye Emperors of Rome were now quiet & wel pacified, there was not only peace planted in ye church, but also it was endowed with manye goodly & large possessions. Since that time the bishops of Roome (as it cōmonly commeth to passe,) corrupted with idlenes, & aboundance of all thinges, forgat by litle and little, the discipline and frugalitye of their former life, & at last degenerated into this monstrous tyranny. By meane wherof they do not only make ye whole world to quake for feare of them, but also sel heauē & hel at their owne pleasure & disposition.

                  out which no notable exployt was euer done worthy cōmendation. The gentiles in the olde time honoured the same as a stay and Buttresse of their whole life. The holye Scripture doeth detest that person (who euer he bee) that is negligent, and slowe in the workes of the Lorde. The Authour and penaltie of whiche curse, yf miserable mortal men would inwardly and diligently ponder, they would lay aside all vaine desires, they would cast away the workes of darkenes, and would be enflamed with the heate of godlines, in such sort, as neither fier nor famin, nor sworde, nor anye violence from Hell or

heauen may hale or drawe them awaye from the loue of god. So feruent was Paule that elect and chosen Uessell of God. So earnest was Dauid the kinge and Prophet. Who professeth hatred against the enemies of God. So zelous was Ieremye, who couched in a deepe dongeon, and afflicted with moste bitter tormentes, did Thunder out hys sayings and prophecies against the frowardnes and ignorance of the people. But we which would seme to worship and reuerence the restored truthe of the Gospel, we do it so faintly and coldly, that it had bene much better for vs neuer to haue knowen so deuine and reuerent treasures, then suffer theyn

godlines, about which matter, that we maye vse suche courage of mynde, and cherefulnes of harte, as the weightynesse of the cause requireth, twoo thinges especiallye ought to be consyred of vs: The first and the chiefest is, that it is gods quarrel whiche we take nowe in hande, by whome we lyue, moue, and haue oure beinge. And seing by his aboūdant goodnes & mercy, we are come to this estate wherein we now stand, let vs restore to him again al that we haue, syth we receyued it of him, when he demaūdes it. Of him only, and alone, cometh whatsoeuer wee haue, had, or maye haue. To this eternall, terrible and almightye God, lette vs consecrate the temples of oure mindes, & dedicate the tabernacles of our bodies, and let vs goe with a sure confidence of mynde (yf neede be,) euen to death: for the honor of him who sent vs, his only begotten son Iesus Christ, to die for vs, to thyntēt he might make vs a waye to euerlastinge life. And in this hathe the holye ghoste decreed to consyste eternal life, trulye to knowe God, and whome he sente Iesus Christ.
               To thende therfore that we may kepe purelye and sincerely this profession of

Gods holye name, and power, there is no labor to be forsaken, no perill to be shonned: For if al thinges, whyche we would euen wish and deuise, were heaped vpon vs, if our soule perishe, there is no hope nor comfort remaininge.
               Therfore let vs eyther clerelye refuse the name of Christians, or els let vs for y• glory of Christ, aduenture any maner of thing, how difficult so euer it semeth to be: yea what e

When after this sort we haue lifte vppe oure mindes to heauen, and ioyned our selfes with God, then let vs come down again to the earth, & ther let vs loke about vs, what kind of men thei be, wt whō we be at variance, what they tēd to, what mark they shote at, & what end they would haue of their matters: And if we list to loke so far back as mās remēbrance is well able to reach to, we shal find them a cruel & bloudy broode, lyke vnto their Graunde and greate Graundefathers, who haue alwayes gone aboute to scatter and spoyle the meeke and innocente flocke of Christe. The Deuyll hathe bene a murtherer

from the beginninge both him self, and also sturred vp Caine in the first creation of the worlde to kyll his brother Abell, makynge sacrifice to God, and beinge holilye occupied. The auncient Prophetes when they lyued the best and quietest life that might be, and tooke vppon them none other charge, but only to declare the will of god vnto his people, were afflycted with al kind of spite and punishment. Our Lorde Iesus Christe liuinge a most peaseable life, & entermedling with nothing, but with the sincere worshippinge of God his father, was most shamefully railed vpon, was most cruelly torne with all kindes of tormentes, & last of all nailed vpon the Crosse. The disciples folowed their masters steppes, beinge like both in life, and not much vnlike in death. The auncient Martirs that did succede them, when as euen theyr aduersaries bare witnesse of their vertue and innocency, and in this thinge only reproued them, that they risinge betimes in the morninge, worshipped in greate assemblies a certein God of theirs, and songe Psalmes to him, yet in this tranquility and synceritie of life, coulde they not escape the tormentes of Heathen Tyrauntes.

The same state stande we nowe in at this daye, wherein God hauing reserued to himself a certaine godlye sorte of people, that refuse to fall down afore the Romish Baall, lyuing according to the lore of Christ, and his Apostles, laying handes vpon no man, troublesome to none, nor attemptinge any thing sediciouslye against any person, but do both geue them selfes to the true worshipping of god, and do exhort also their brethren to the like vnitye and concord in Christ, voyde of all contēcion, free from al force and violence, and continuall mouers of the people in their sermons to pacience & quietnesse: Yet this Romish Haman and tyraunt, because he sees hymselfe not crowched and kneled to, he commaundes not only gallowes to be sette vp for the poore Mardocheans, the most pacient and innocent seruantes of god, but also murthereth them with swordes, strangles them with halters, whirles them vpon wheeles, and broyles them in the fire. So as if the Tyrannye of all times and ages were well wayed and considered, it can not bee compared with this most horrible crueltye, that these Romish Tetrarches haue vsed toward

this godlye people of Christ. For the etrarch is

But the crueltye of this our Romish Nero, (far passing Maxentius & the madnes of all the tyranntes of the world) is suche, that it extendeth euen to the ashes of men, disquietinge their dead carcasses, that haue of longe time bene buried in the earth, and (as much as lieth in him) suffring them neuer to dye. O barbarous brutishnes of this proud purpled prelate. O mōstrous vsurpers vpon Peter. O most cruel and bloudy seat. And shal we now cōpassed about with such enemies, winke at the matter▪ Plounged in such perilles, shal we slumber stil as we do? So malicious foes thundring about vs on euery side, with threatninges & sword, shal we lye styl & holde oure peace? Who shal take our partes if we helpe not oure selues?

If we get vs not out of our doores the rather, we shall euerye mothers son of vs bee slaine at home in our owne coūtrey, yea in our own houses, when there shall bee none to helpe vs. If we drawe backe and make courtesye in this quarrell of Relygion, we shall ere it be longe, lese not onlye oure religion, but forgo all that we haue besides. Althoughe we be neuer so loth to fight, yet very necessity forces vs there to. And the farther we flye from it, the nearer it commes: Yea, and the closer a man kepes him selfe in, the more daunger vndoubtedly hanges ouer his head. Wherfore against such conspiratoures we may lawfully arme our selfes. Uiolence (if neede so require) maye be encountered with violence. I meane not, to stande against lawfull Magistrates, (whom I made exception of afore) Nor yet for the gospels sake onelye, whiche the prouidence of God hathe defended heretofore, and wil defend it hereafter, albeit the Pope bestirre hym neuer so much: But against the wycked & vniust furles of the Romish rable, that would ouerthrow and destroy vs and all ours, without hearing of our cause, & withoute

all lawe and aucthoritye.
               This quarrell is a cōmon quarrel to vs al (my brethren) for as much as we haue all one God our father in heauen, and al one sauiour Iesus Christ his son.

He hath layde snares and baytes to hurte and harme youre common weales: He seeketh all the corners he may, to entre into you: He thyrsteth after youre bloude, and woulde (if he wist howe) roote quite out of the earth, both your name, & al maner of remembraunce

of you. Whereunto he hath many assistauntes, and also great aides and succoures of vyle and naughtye men. And as for your selfes, nexte vnto God, ye haue this one onlye refuge left you, or elles none at all. Which is, that ye loue together, agree together, holde and take parte together. Ech of youre Nations seuered one from another, the Romishe force maye easilye ouerthrowe, but ioyned all surelye together, it can neuer hurt. Our life brethren, thoughe it be an hundred yeare longe, is in dede but a short and a miserable time, as Iacob witnesseth of him selfe, and this same being so vncertaine and so quickly run out, to howe manye perilles of fortune besides, is it subiect? with how manye daungerous diseases also is it wasted? Let vs therefore take bolde and stout stomackes vnto vs, aduauncynge oure selues, and lyftynge vppe oure heartes vnto heauen. In a good quarrell it is better to dye manfullye, then to yeld cowardlye. And as for the goodnesse of the quarrell, what eyther is, or can be a better quarrell, then that that is for the defence of vertue, truth, & the Gospel? Or how on the other side, can there be a worse composition

or yelding, then when the truth shal yeld to lyes, the light to darkenes: and the eternall wisedome of God to mens traditions.
               Thus haue I cōmunicated with you frend Cecinna all my griefes, and cares, so farre fourth as my busines woulde permit. There is nought remaininge nowe behinde, but that with most earnest prayers we cōmit our whole cause vnto God, requiringe him to looke fauourablye vpon this his troubled and afflicted Churche, hallowed with the precious bloude of oure Sauiour Iesus Christ, that put their truste and confydence in him, that liue (as nere as mans frailtye wyll suffer) accordynge to hys lawes, that hang altogether vpon him, and finallye do referre them selfes and all that they haue wholy to his singuler goodnes and mercy.
               Arise, O god, and put to flight thine

It is for thy glory that we fight, it is thy maiestye that oure aduersaries assaile, and the honour of thy Godhead that they impech. And though they pretende neuer so much the name of christ, it is the Sea of Roome wherunto they

would bringe and conuay all maner of honour and reuerence due to thy holye name. We might easily be at one with them, if we would suffer thy people to be plucked away from thy Gospel, and to be fast bounde to their fond and wicked traditions: winking also besides at the great slaughter of thy seruauntes. In fine if we woulde forsake the true sound, sincere, and Apostolicke church, & woulde ioyne our selues to this same fonde, fayned and counterfeit vysarr of the Romish church, alto corrupted with supersticion, & defiled with most fowle errours. But O most louinge Sauiour, we can not departe from thee, nor neuer shal. Thou art Iesus Christ, the sonne of god the father, hauing the wordes of eternall life, which we haue belieued. We be thy shepe, and therfore we heare thy voyce. Thou art the true and only pastour of oure soules. And therfore we acknowledge thee onlie, as for that same hired shepehard of Rome, we can not skill of him, but doe rather hate him as a thiefe & a murtherer, because he entred not in by the doore, but thrust him self in a by way. This cruel and bloudye wolfe raungeth vppe and downe spoiling thy flocke. Kepe him of

O Lorde assist thy seruauntes, O God ayde thy people, and thou O Sauioure succoure thy Supplyauntes, and those that call vpon thee. For we haue none other that fighteth for vs, but thee onelye O Lord god, and Iesus Christ thy sonne and our redemer, who sitteth aboue in heauen on thy righte hande in glory euerlasting.

            VV. S.
            
               O God arise, with thy right hand,
               Lift vp thy fallinge flocke,
               The wicked fende, wt wrathfull moode
               Doth threatē sore this stock.
               These irksome daies, wt vprores fierce,
               In feareful sort are toste,
               With force is vertue rent and torne,
               And fury armes an hoste.
               Lawe opprest, is laide full lowe,
               And lust for lawe beares swaye,
               And puffed pride, with raging threates
               Against the skyes doeth braye:
               But we thy ofspringe poore, that care,
               Taduaunce Christes glory due,
               That do extoll thy blessed name,
               With praise and honour true,
               Afflicted are full sore, and in
               A thousande perilles lyue,
               And bloodye force doth on eche side,
               From place to place, vs driue.
               Lo, some the strangling rope doth kill,
               Some, Yron wheles do wrast,
               Some are consumde in fierye flames,
               Some into floodes are cast,
               
                  
Here swordes, there guns, the tyrantes shake,
               And force the fearful sound,
               By sundry slaughters they make red
               With bloud, the luke warme groūd.
               What furye nowe (O brethren dere)
               Doth sturre, these rancors woode?
               From whence proceadth this gredye thirst
               And wish to spoyle our bloud?
               One father we haue, in heauen all,
               One sauiour and no moo,
               One flesh we be, One name we beare,
               One faith we haue also.
               But mothers discorde (alas for woo)
               Doth breake the bandes of peace,
               Out of thys spring, these sundry illes,
               To flowe still do not cease.

               Whose infants were thaūcient troupe

               Bring vp, when he was here,
               To his disciples, care was left,
               Of this his spouse moste dere.

               This mother of corruption voyde,
               In godly life did shine
               And had respect vnto her spouse,
               Alwayes and to his line.
               Holy, gentle and milde, she was,

               But craftes that money gettes.
               Lawes she dothe, to her selfe appoint,
               And breake them as she will,
               Of gold a greedy gut she is,
               And bribes deuoureth still.

               And doth the members wound of God,

               And neuer hath full pawes.
               We followe thee, and eke thy spouse,
               All thy preceptes we loue,
               Our hope, and helpe doth euer come,
               From thy great Throne aboue.

               And although we vnworthy be,
               Yet worthy Christ beholde,
               Who wt his bloud, hath washed clean,

               Thy seruauntes wracke not small,
               And let the wicked armies force,
               In midddes of threates downe fall,
               Or let thy grace them all forgeue,
