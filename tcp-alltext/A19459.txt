               THE singuler care (Right Reuerend) which your Lordship hath had in your owne Diocesse,
                  1. Tim. 3.1.
                confirmeth the sentence of Saint Paul. That it is a true saying, if any man desire the office of a Bishop, he desireth a worthie worke; For the Church as Saint Bernard saith, hath beene troubled with three conflictes; from Tyrants, Heretickes, and Hipocrites. The first was incountered by the patience of Martyrs, which victoriously conquered the crueltie of those times.Mallei haereticarum. The second, with the vnanswerable learning of the ancient Fathers, many of them beeing (as they are called) the hammers of Heretickes. The last with the synceritie and diligence of Bishops, for what other remedie remaineth for the hypocrisie of these daies (if that may be tearmed hypocrisie which cannot lurke, by reason

of the aboundance, nor desireth not by reason of his boldnes) but the singuler integritie, and courage executing the discipline of the Church in your Lordship & others of your place,

                to whom Saint Ierom (although sower in many things) wisheth vs to be subiect, and giue reuerence as to the parents of our soules. For in a true Bishop in deed, his words are edifications, his life righteousnes; his presence delightfull, and his memorie blessed. Thus shall your Lordship bring to passe, that those who are not, may be made wise; that those who are, may not be deceiued, that such as haue beene deceiued may be wise againe: that vnbeleeuers may be conuerted vnto the faith, that such as were conuerted, may not be turned from it, that those who are, may returne vnto it, that men peruerted may be directed aright, that men subuerted may be called vnto the truth, and that the subuerters themselues, may be conuinced with strong reasons, eyther to amend if it be possible, or if not, to loose their authoritie, that they hurt not others. Of these I may say as Saint Bernard doth, (but I will speake to their owne vnderstanding) they are Canes ad scissionem, vulpes ad fraudem; and by your Lordships care, and the rest of the Bishops: aut corrigendi, ne pereant, aut ne perimant coercendi. Now particulerly vnder your Honours fauour, I will expresse in few words, why the answere of this Apologie is directed vnto your Lordship, as to one to whom in many respects I am especially bound. First, it was thought fit, that seeing the reasons were giuen vnto your Lordship as an account of that obedience, which a Minister vnder your owne charge did owe vnto you, the answere (how meane soeuer) should be admitted to plead in the hearing of the same Iudge, which being finished long since, was by authoritie deferred, in hope that silence and time, would haue giuen satisfaction to all, who were not fully resolued in this cause. Heereunto I

add my owne particuler Motiues (I hope without offence) which are and shall be iust reasons to make me humbly obserue your honour;
                  Christ Colledge, and Queens Colledge in Cans.
                the nearenesse of the same soyle which gaue the first ayre vnto vs both, then the same two Colledges which gaue furtherance to both our studies: and lastly, the entrance into my Ministerie, which with many fauours I receiued by the imposition of your Lordships hands, these all as they are, hopefull assurances of your pardon for this boldnes, so they are and shall be strong reasons to make me remaine in all dutie at your Honours seruice. Lambeth. Ianuarie 22. 1605.

            A Preface to the Reader.
            
               THERE are few resolutions that are filled with more hazard, then those which are vndertaken to giue satisfaction to distempered humors; wherein whilest euerie man would seeme eyther not to erre at all, or to haue some colourable excuse for that which they had rather call freedom of conscience and Christian libertie then tearme errour, the state of the Church hangeth ballanced with some opposite contrarieties, as if it were the most profitable wisdome to stand in consultation, and not to aduenture to hold any thing. Doubtlesse no cause hath gained lesse to the defendants then this of the Church gouernement; for first being in it selfe barren, it hath little wherein there can be vse of the ancient Fathers: for whilest men out of their owne fancie will frame dislikes, wee can but in the generall alleage the constant moderation of our forefathers, and without warrant for particulers, satisfie them so farre as Religion and reason will giue leaue: Secondly, all men are caried with a pittie naturally toward such whom they suppose to suffer for the testimonie of a good conscience, whilest others are suspected to flatter the present state; as if nothing could be reputed honest, which were not a bold opposition (vnder colour of consciene)

to a setled gouernment, vnto these may be added that which is not the least euill, that whilest impatience & zeale openeth the mouthes of our enemies for any fault in our answering committed by vs; enuy doth open the mouthes of our supposed friends, for that which may be thought to be done well. So that though the recōpence hath nothing in it to be desired, this only remaineth as the comfort against all trobles, that it is a right vse of our small talent dispensed with Humility and dutie for the benefit and peace of the Church of Christ; where, first in the daies of our late dread soueraigne of blessed memory some fearing superstition might returne (like a troublesome guest, neither long nor farr absent) sundry of the most learned & most sincere, not called to the honor & the burden of a Bishopprick were consulted with all, to giue satisfaction to such who seemed rather to follow the example of forraine Churches, then to haue iust reasons to mislike their owne.
            To this end letters were sent from the reuerend fathers of the Church, to desire the resolution concerning the apparell of ministers, Ceremonies, and other indifferent things to M. Bullinger, F. Martyr, Gualter, Bucer, & others, men without comparison for integrity & learning equall to the best in those times, & not much exceeded by any, to my knowledge that haue liued since; their answers to these questions for the contentment of our brethren (if they loue peace) we thought to haue published in the end of this treatise.By Master Cartwright Martin. &c After these times, by the suggestion of some both from Geneua & Scotland, the Church had not long rest, but that diuers admonitions, were written to the Parliament, desiring a new discipline, sundry Inuectiues against the

Bishops & diuers vnhallowed pāphlets from the brood of Cham, who gloried in the discouery of the supposed nakednes of their owne fathers; a little more then ordinary rigor (for their malypart boldnes had awaked the accustomed clemēcy of a most gracious prince) by the execution of some few, stopped in a manner for a time the mouthes, & the Pennes of all; letting the ages that come after vnderstand thus much, that writings how learned soeuer (as what could be more excellent for modesty & iudgement,D. Whitgift. then the pains of that most worthy Archbishop) are able to do litle good for the quiet of the Church, if the magistrates be wanting to giue aid: & that they who at first make holines & reformation the scope of whatsoeuer they say or write, pretending to aime at nothing but to make men better; in the end, by degrees fall to a vanity prophanely to libel to make others laugh, & in my weak opiniō few things euer hapned in this kingdom more auailable to breed Atheisme then that was. But the scope being for a Presbyteriall discipline it found with the most of that faction this fauour to be reprooued no more sharpely then the sin of the sons of Hely: hitherto all stroue for a Presbitery, wherof at the first comming of our most gracious soueraigne to this kingdom many were filled with a vain hope, doubtle
                  •
                deceiued by such men, who either vnderstood not the state of this cōmonwealth or had little care of the happy prosperity of this Church.
            But in the end, when authority was more blessed, & assisted from aboue, then to be deluded with such mists or to giue any hope to couetous affections greedily longing for the fall of Bishops (which one Act of preseruing their state and honour) amongst many thousand arguments of fauour shewed towards them shall stirre vp the praiers of all that now liue for

the continuance of his state, and make his memorie blessed amongst all posterities to the worlds end; then I say many began to make a rent in the Church, and to breake from vs (chusing rather (with what conscience they know) to forsake their function and calling, then to yeeld their conformitie to the cerimonies of this Church; which hitherto by themselues were euer 
                  •
               eputed as things indifferent; and doubtlesse neither so many nor so dangerous, but in this time of light and knowledge they may be admitted without superstition at all: forseeing (as Peter Martyr saith) we be so free as we haue but a few Ceremonies, and those easie and gentle, it would be an intollerable thing, and worthie to be condemned,P Martyr. 20 C. Coun. part. 4. cap 11. sect. 9 if we should not performe them without corruption. I wish those to consider well, who are desirous to make these things simply vnlawfull, both how they differ from themselues and others at other times, and what bondage (vnder the name of libertie) they impose vpon the Church by denying her authoritie to ordaine ceremonies; in which if little or nothing be left vnto her, neither shall she need much the directiō of Gods spirit to guid her consultations, nor challenge any great obedience in her owne name, if all things that are, be simply either good or euill: to which errour if Zeale or opinion shall tranport any, he must eyther make the worship of God to be without Ceremonies, or those Ceremonies simply necessarie, without which there is no worshippe; none that I know would haue religion to want all Ceremonies, sauing onely those who would haue all men to want Religion: some there are which wish that these ceremonies were simple, chast, and few, that is not significant at all: It were doubtlesse a

great folly (if not an idlenes in God seruice) eyther to admit or retaine those ceremonies, which they purposed should signifie nothing; but moderate minds do think otherwise, that neither ceremonies nor their signification, are to be misliked as vnlawfull, whilest nothing is signified, but that which thēselues wil account lawfull. So then, neither depriuing the Church of the vse of ceremonies in diuine worship, nor making these of that vnchangeable nature as simply eyther her good or euill, but onely as things of themselues indifferent, (for better place and respect they neuer retained in our Church) we will briefely set downe for the satisfying of some men; that indifferent things by Ciuill or Ecclesiasticall constitution do change their nature, and by vertue of commaundement become necessarie; so that eyther they must be not indifferent, but simply vnlawfull; or being indifferent, such as by commanddement are made necessarie. To denie that there are things indifferent, is to take Christian libertie from men: and to denie the ceremonies in their owne nature to be such, is to take al liberty from the Church for without these what is there wherein the Church is not expresly and necessarily directed by the word of God? we are taught that all things which happē vnder the compasse of human action are of three sorts; eyther good, or euill, or indifferent: of the first and the second kinde are all things commaunded or forbidden in the law of God, (except the ceremonie of the Sabbath) commaunded to the Iewes but not to vs: Indifferent things are of that nature, that by themselues, and properly they are neither good nor euill, but in respect of some other thing,

                  . as to drinke Wine, Ale, or Water, to vse these or those garments which of themselues

haue no holines in thē, & by which a man is not made better: & of these only, & such like, the Apostle speaketh, all things are lawful forme:1. Cor. 6.12. 1. Cor. 9.22. wherin whilst he professed his freedome, yet he acknowledgeth that he became boūd, & to the Iew a Iew, to those that were vnder the law, as vnder the law, to those that were without the law, as without the law, to the weak he became weake, to cōclude, he became al to al, that he migh win some: thus he made a vow at Cenchrea, circumcised Timothy which he did not to Titus, by reason of false brethren crept in to spy their liberty: so that all things were lawful, not only which cōcerned cōmon life, but also in ceremonies & the outward worship of God, in which (as one wel noteth) the spiritual worship is shadowed, but not contained. But when experience had taught, that such liberty became dangerous to the Church & the cōmonwelth, being turned oftētimes into a lice

                true religion. For which mischiefe necessitie hath onely found out this remedy, to moderate this liberty that it neither erre on the right hand nor the left, that it neycome short nor go beyond a meane; therfore the Apostle saith all things are lawful for me, but al things profit not, all things are lawful, but al things are not expediēt, wherin he toucheth the extemities at both hands. Now then the means to keep our liberty, that it neither

be too much, nor too little are of two sorts: general, & speciall: the general is charity the principal direction of mans life. For whatsoeuer we desire to do or omit (being in it selfe indifferēt) charity must consider how farre to proceed without offence: for why should our liberty (saith S. Paul) be condēned of another mans conscience? & therfore in this case we are rather to depart from that liberty we haue, then to be offensiue to those who are more weak, & so giue occasion for thē to speak euil of vs, & of that which was left free: for charity willeth vs in these things to respect others more then our selues, & rather to omit that which is lawful for vs, thē to do that which is hurtfull for them: the other rule to limit indifferēt things is speciall: which is not so distinguisht from the other, as if it were without charity, but that charity which ought to be in all, is here directed in a speciall maner: for howsoeuer charity so extendeth it selfe that it may serue to all parts of our life, as though we need not to be directed by any other law, yet because al men are not so wel sighted perfectly to discern what is expedient at all times, & for that the offices of charity are somtimes changed, (for times & occasions may fal out, that things iust & to be done, may be clean contrary) therfore there is required an experienced and mature iudgment to determine what is fit, least whilst we labour to profit we iniury the Church & the commonwealth, in which are contained the charities of all. God therefore respecting mans weaknes hath appointed magistrates & Gouernours in both, to serue as 
                  •
               ies to guide & direct what is fit to be done, & to this end to make lawes concerning indifferent things, that so the whole body may be gouerned with comelines, order, and edification. This no man can denie, but such as desire to be exempted

Ministers to whom we must be subiect, not for feare but for conscience; obeying also our spirituall rulers, for they watch ouer vs to giue account vnto God for our soules.Rom. 13 Heb. 13 And therefore no man can denie, but that in things of this nature, all men are to be gouerned by their lawes; which whilest they are in force, commanding or forbidding binde the conscience as the Decalogue doth. Herein if any would seeme to see more then those that doe make lawes (a thing not likely seing the most, and the wisest, and the best experienced are assembled to that end) we cannot think it warrantable to be so presumptuous, nor expedient to dispute (but in place of counsell) of the equitie of lawes when they are once established: this moderation if all men had obserued, doubtlesse long since this Church had beene blessed with a happie peace. But if any man be perswaded that the ceremonies inioyned are not of this nature, it is but an opinion lately sprung vp, whereunto the necessitie of obedience in indifferent things hath compelled them to flie, and it satisfieth vs (though it cannot then) that with all antiquitie, and the Church we do thinke otherwise: God grant vs all in due time truly to thinke and to speake the same things.

                   when IOSEPHS cup was found in BENIAMINS sacke, IVDAH (assured of the fact, ignorant of the meanes) fals to confession of a falt vnexcusable, and yet there was no fault. To subscribe, and to deny to subscribe to the same articles, appeares so manifest a fault, either of inconstancie, or vnhonesty, as were I not priuie to a iust reason of both, I should say with IVDAH, What shall I say vnto my Lord? What can I speake? How can I iustifie my selfe? God hath found out the wickednesse of thy Seruant.

The one, whereby wee discerne, the other, wherewith wee loue: the one leading man vnto Truth, the other vnto Vertue. From the one, are deriued right Counsels; from the other, vpright affections.

But suffering himselfe to fall from this gouernment, hee hath found his affection a false Counsellour; dissentions and oppositions cunningly suggested, being the continuall conflict euen betwixt those two nearest, whose first loue was Vnion, and the bond Peace: since which time, man, whilst he erreth (pursuing with eagrenesse, what affections desire, rather then Reason doth approue) hee laboureth euen by contradicting himselfe, because he doth not loue what he ought in reason: to finde out reason for himselfe, for that which hee doth loue. And seeing, where the Intentions are right, our weaknesse doth not euer performe what it ought: by reason, Infirmity doth accompany al the faculties of mans soule, wee neither vnderstand rightly what is truth, nor (hauing beene deceiued through the strength of some

weake affections) are easily perswaded to confesse our errour▪ for Trueth and Vertue, by creation, being mans scope, that which hee wanteth abilitie to attaine, yet therein hee is not easily perswaded to acknowledge that hee doth faile. For, that which was at first his duty, cannot but bee his desire still; shame driuing him to make excuses, which may cause him in the opinions of some men (though not to be) yet to seeme righteous. From hence haue proceeded defences, and Apologies, both tending to this end, to shewe that wee desire approbation in all wee doe; or that our error (wherin wee faile) might bee thought lesse. This account, as wee striue to render vnto all that either see faults, or surmise folly in the actions committed by vs, so especially to those, to whome wee owe most duety, both because such (discerning our follies) must prize vs at a lower rate; and their examples are vsually the Rules of all others iudgements.

                   Hee knewe well there was nothing more easie then not onely to say, but to thinke that they haue founde the truth. The strongest externall motion which caused him to forsake the Manichies, was that he perceiued them to be more cunning and eloquent to confute others, then sound or certaine to defend their owne. If this moderation could in humilitie haue possessed some (otherwise profitable Instruments in this Church) then should neither their second excuses haue beene worse then their first faults, nor our labour in answering haue beene required at this time. To subscribe vnto the orders of the Church of England, and not long after to refuse (as a thing vnlawfull) to subscribe vnto the same orders, must imply (vnlesse it bee well excused) vnhonesty, Inconstancie, or both; seeing it is not like the cuppe in the sack of BENIAMIN, which IVDAH confesseth a fault; their difference being this; that, in the one, the fact was not done by him that was thought guiltie, and confessed by him that was not: and in the other, certainly done by him that cannot but confesse the fact, and yet excused to bee no fault; so that the summe of this whole defence, is; Whether a man subscribing to the orders and constitutions of the Church of England foure times, may afterward haue reasons to deny a subscription or obedience vnto them. In all reason, it must require some sufficient disiunction, that contradictories should both bee, and both bee warranted to bee lawfull. Let vs then heare him speake for himselfe.

               IF it may appeare, the Intention of the Church euer since the beginning of our late Maiesties Raigne, of most blessed and happie memory, euen vntill this present, to haue beene both for the Doctrine and ceremonies all one, and in both as neere as was possible proportioned to the state of both, in the daies of King Edward the sixt: it must needes bee in all reason some vncharitable collection, to pretend a difference, where there is none; or some sodaine alteration eyther in iudgement or affection, to doe and to denie the same things, where there is no difference: nay, it must needs be an vnexcusable indiscretion to lay the fault of our owne lightnes vpon the variation or declination of our doctrine, and ceremonies, from that they were; as if we ment eyther to conceale vnthankfully the greatest benefit from God bestowed vpon this land (namely the zealous continuance vnder a new Prince of the olde auncient, and true Religion amongst vs) or to lay an Imputation of some declining vpon his gouernement, whose princely care zealously

indeuoured, that there might be none. Nay, who (wee may truly say, neyther can wee conceale it without great ingratitude) hath laboured more to rectifye the Church from the supposed blemishes, wherewith she was thought stayned, and to giue a more full satisfaction by conference to the most zealous, and the best learned of the aduerse part, then anie Prince in any Kingdome or age euer did before him; and therefore recall that errour which is the foundation of your defence following, and say not, that the intention of the Church is eyther varied by some degrees towardes the Antartique, Or newly discouered to bee other then you conceiued it, vnlesse you confesse your conceite to haue beene farre otherwise then was fitte for one of your calling or iudgement: feare not ingeniously to confesse, that the intention of the Church in vrging these Ceremonies is, and hath beene euer the same: And that your selfe haue approued that which now you are afraid vpon some reasons, which to you in particular might seeme good: It must be a great fault rather to make the whole Church vnconstant, then one man.

It must needes bee a fault (as Saint Austin saith) To regard whom you serue,

For although as the same father saith, a good intention cannot excuse an euill fact, yet an euill intention is sufficient to condemne a fact otherwise good. Neither will it be much auaileable to search out with what intention things are done, which manifestly appeare to be euill, in that they are done: And doubtlesse voluntarily to seeke quarrels against that which before vnder our handes we haue approued, is not so much an instabilitie of minde (the common infirmitie of mankinde) as a malitious follie bringing little aduantage vnto those that doe it, but I will not suspect so vncharitably of

you, whose wisedome and conscience I hope to bee much better, then, that without great reason you would incurre the disgrace of so happie a time, or procure the displeasure of so good a Prince; which being considered, doubtlesse the reasons are great, that haue made you aduenture for to hazard both. And I am fully perswaded that few men (not altogether carelesse of the Churches peace) would so easily debarre themselues from the manifolde happinesse of these times, or so vsually runne into the Iust deserued displeasure of the best King, and most religious that euer this Ilande had, if verie great, verie waightie, verie apparant, and vnanswerable reasons did not mooue them to it.

they pretend to the saluation of their soules, to how many thinges (not vnreconcylably euill) would they haue yeilded, rather then haue brought them to so great a daunger? yet giue me leaue without offence to tell you that the happinesse of your flockes depend not euer vpon such teachers, neyther will the losse altogether bee so great as they peraduenture imagin, but howsoeuer, vndoubtedly the Church hath little reason to value their labours at any great price, who haue not yet learned to bee obedient to her voyce. But as the sore of disobedience groweth to an vlcer out of the swelling of pride, as HVGO noteth, so there are three means (sayth he) onely, left for the cure of it, playster, oyntment, launcing: the first hee calleth example, the second exhortation, the third, correction. When the two first fayle, then the last must bee vsed. It may bee thought (perhappes) seueritie to practise so sharpe censures vpon the ministers of the Church, who doe all that they doe vpon a good grounde, but vvhat if no other meanes will serue to cure the great swelling of this Church? haue not playsters, oyntmentes, milder medicines beene practised? And yet are not the swellinges as great still? The knife onely remaynes to launce them. I exhort not to crueltie, but defend those who are more grieued to punish with depriuation, and such like, then those that suffer it: and I am heartily sorie that some (otherwise) men vertuous, and profitable to the Church, shoulde fall into these opinions with so strong an opposition, as if God and the King did commaund two contrarie things, I confesse my selfe the vnablest of many thousandes

               IT may be, we are misled in opinion: (thanked be God, it is not heresie) but, hee that once will goe against the vnknowne error of his Conscience, will at last haue no conscience to goe against knowne error. The Conscience foyled, is like a distemperate Locke, that no Key will open.

               IF you had opinion that you were misled, though it were in opinion and not heresie; yet wisdome and Religion ought both to moue you to hasten to that truth, from whence, whilst you differ, although your doctrine be all one with the Church of England, yet neither can you liue with that ioy in your owne soule, whilst you are at variance (though for Ceremonies) with those that doe rule ouer you; neither can the Church inioy so good vse of your labours, whilst you are not carefull to preserue the vnitie of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
                  Ephe. 4.3. False opinions concerning the gouernment

of the Church, doubtlesse are not equall, yea, dangerous to those Heresies that are against the Faith; yet seeing the least errour cannot bee maintained, but by broaching newe, wisdome will counsell vs to hasten in humility to rest and repose our selues in the iudgement of the Church. But where the conscience either thinketh it vnlawfull (out of her owne knowledge so supposed) or feareth it not to bee lawfull, out of the timerous care arising from her owne weaknesse) there wee can easily bee content to expect them with much patience, if their humility will giue them leaue to learne; and rather to doe what they ought not, vntill they bee resolued, then to doe what they should, being not resolued. Because (as you say) He that once will goe against the vnknowne error of his Conscience, will at last haue no Conscience to goe against knowne error. But, seing al men vnderstand not aright what that is which they alledge for themselues,In the modest examination. Cap. 7 pag. 84. when they say, the

               There is naturally ingraffed in the heart of man that light of Nature, which can neuer bee put out, that telleth him, that no euill is to bee done. Now, Reason, according to the knowledge that it hath (which in some is more, and in some lesse) deliuereth his Iudgement of particulers,

Act. This application is made in a threefold maner, as,

                     1 First, to consider whether such a thing bee done or not done, and surely in this, our Consciences can best tell the actions and intention of those thinges,Eccl. 7.23 24. which are done by vs. Giue not thy heart (saith SALOMON) to all the wordes that men speake, least thou doe heare thy seruant cursing thee, for oftentimes thy heart knoweth that thou likewise hast cursed others.
                     
                     2 The second Application is, when wee Iudge of the fact which is done, whether it bee well or euill, the measure of our knowledge in this, making vs mistake, as euill for good: so that, sometimes to be euill, which indeede is good.
                     3 The third is, that this or that is to bee done, or to bee left vndoone.
                           Conscientia.

               In this first, it is a witnesse which will not lye: In the second, it may accuse, but not absolutely excuse: In the last, it may binde (though it want strength) in this respect onely, that wee are weake. For those newe cordes (and such are newe opinions) which were not able to holde SAMPSON,Iud. 16.9. may easily holde him fast, that is by many degrees weaker then SAMPSON was. The first of these respecteth the time past; the second, the time present; the third, for the well or euill doing, the hauing or suffering, the ioy or torment that is to come. As, if hee that had made time the preciousest circumstance of all our actions, had set our Conscience, as the seuere and diligent watchman of all our times.
               Now, hauing set down the vse of conscience, the next

consideration is of the errors of it. These are two, a false Assumption, and a false application. In the first, wee take those things to bee good and true, which indeede, directly are euill and false, (an error peraduenture, which may appeare hereafter to haue misled you in this point:) so those that put the Apostles to death, did thinke in that action, that they pleased God: for the time was come that our Sauiour foretold; Whosoeuer killeth you,
                  Iob. 16.2. 
                  will thinke that hee doth God seruice. In the second, a false application arising out of a true ground: because hee heareth that God is to bee loued aboue all things, therefore he thinketh it vnlawfull to loue any thing but God: these erre not alike, but the error of Conscience doth infect both. Neither ought a Conscience that thus erreth, to bynd, seeing the force and strength of Conscience is not built vpon himselfe, but vpon some Precept, (seeming so to it selfe) bring no good reason, but either because it is commaunded, or else forbidden. Against which, contrarily either to doe or to maintaine, is to foyle (as you say) the Conscience, and to make it like a distempered lock, that no key will open. But, let vs heare your selfe lay downe the greeuance, whereat your Conscience doth either truely repine, or in weakenesse stumble.

               IF the matters be looked on which be imposed (I now speake of the Ceremonies) they seeme light, but if their deriuation from Antichrist, they are hatefull; if the simple vse of them be considered, they are shadowes, but if the late abuse, which is hardly seuered from the things, they are Gyants.

If their nature bee weighed, they are indifferent, but if their vse, not so; while the Papists insult, the zealous mourne, and both stumble at them, and both they that like, and they that like them not, cast vs (that haue not vsed them) out of their Consciences, as men ready to say Masse, rather then to loose our liuings, and the very boyes & girles laugh at our most graue and reuerend Ministers, whome before they looked on with feare.
            
            
               ANSVVER.
               THat which troubleth your Conscience, seemeth to be the Ceremonies of this Church;
                     Secundae intentiones.
                   
                  in show, light, but such as haue their originall from Antichrist; shadowes, but Gyants; in nature indifferent, but in vse not so. We account Ceremonies in religion, if they be harmlesse, and tend to edification (such as are the Ceremonies of our Church) the second Intentions of the Law, Intermediate meanes, not to be dispised of a better and more religious seruice: for as to thinke that Ceremonies (without true & inward holinesse) could cleanse from sinnes, were to erre; and to bee lewish and superstitious, so to account them of no vse, were to bee meerely prophane. For both the Iudiciall and the Ceremoniall Lawe, being in a sort Morall (as the scholemen speake) the one in an order to our neighbours, the other, in an order to God; these haue no other allowance in Gods worship, but as they are vertuous furtherances of his honour. In the Ceremonies of the olde Lawe, there were three things to be obserued. First, that they were all ordained for the expressing of the inward

and morall worshippe, to serue to true holinesse, Faith, Hope
                  ▪ and Charity, without which, all the rest were reiected (euen as a burden) by him that commā
                  ded them; saying, I will haue mercy, but not sacrifice. Secondly, if Ceremonies bee contrary to true holinesse,1. Sam. 15.22. they were to bee omitted (for their end was to further deuotion and not to hinder it). In this respect they were dispensable, when either by the place or time, two violent circumstances of all our actions or for som Impediment they could not wel be vsed, this made, that euen Circumcision was omitted for those who were born in the desart;Ios. 5. as being vnfit to moue Immediatly after that wound, and beeing vncertaine to rest, seeing they must follow the fire & the cloud when they moued. Thus in persecution wee are content rather to exercise Religion without Ceremonies, then to want it; which in peace to neglect or contemne, must needes bee a great offence. Those times beeing fittest to serue GOD with greater reuerence and more holy solemnities which are compassed about with greater rest, and more happie blessings. Lastly, when Ceremonies are requisite to testifie our faith (as doubtlesse they are then when they are either vpon malice or through misvnderstanding oppugned) wee may not in conscience remit any part of them: for the refusing of such can be no small sinne, where the vsing is blessed with the crowne of Martyrdome.1. Machab. 6.7, Now, if you can showe that those which for long time haue beene retained in our Church (for wee haue not inuented new, but reserued the old, vsed in the Church before ROME was Idolatrous) are heauie burdens, deriued from Antichrist, Hatefull

Gyants, not Indifferent, but vnlawfull in vse, Scandals, and such like (which wee are sure neither you, nor the leardnedst in that cause, are able to proue) then wee shall thinke you haue much reason to refuse them, in regard of Conscience. All the actions of man are of three sorts; good, euill, and indifferent. If our Conscience say, that is to bee done which is naturally good, it is no errour:
                     Eadem ratione prohibentur mala, qua precipiuntur bona.
                   If it deny that to bee done which is euill, it is no errour: For by the same reason euill is forbidden, which commaundeth good; but on the contrary, if it say that to bee done which is naturally euill, or not to be done, which is good, it is doubtlesse a cōscience which doth err in both, likewise in indifferēt things (such as you say these are, if their nature bee waighed, but they are necessarie if the lawfull cōmandement be added) to make, I say, such absolutely necessarie, where authority hath not determined, is doubtles a Conscience that doth much erre. For euery will that disagreeth from reason,
                  Rom. 14. 
                  either true or false, directly sinneth: for, whatsoeuer is not of Faith is sinne; and yet euery thing which is done by the will giuing assent to reason is not voide of Sin; because that Ignorance, which is a fault, cannot possiblye make the action to be without fault.
               Now, in thinges which naturally are indifferent (as these are) the Precept of the superiour doth binde more then the Conscience of the inferiour can;
                     Aquinus in disp. de ver. quest. 17. Art. 5. for the subiect hath the Commaundement of his lawfull superiour, whether King or Bishoppe for his warrant; and in things of this nature, his duetie is not to examine, but onely to performe what hee seeth commaunded. Wherein wee doubt not, but the Consideration is and will be greate of those,

who are in authoritie, what they doe commaund. The conscience that doth erre (though it bynd vntill it be reformed) ought notwithstanding to be reformed, because either Ignorance, necligence, pryde, Inordinat affection, fayntnes, perplexitie, or self loue are the corrupt and originall causes of the errors of it; so that, if none of these haue ouerruled you (as I dare not condemne another mans seruant): but that knowledge with due consideration, hath directed you in that ye did, there is great reason to hearken to your excuse, and to regard you and others with much attention, whilst with reuerence and humility, you alledge your Conscience. In the meane time, for remedy against these errours, let them not disdaine the Counsell which wisemen haue found to be most safe. If it bee of ignorance, to say with IEHOSOPHAT; Wee knowe not what to doe, but our eyes are toward thee.

Neyther do wee desire a place in their conscience, who cannot make a difference betwixt vsing of these, and saying of Masse, which things though eyther they cannot or list not to distinguish, yet we do, last of all, that boyes and girles laugh at those for the vsing of these things whom before they looked on with feare: It ought no more to be any motiue to a religious and graue man, then when Michol saw Dauid daunsing before the Arke,2. Sam. 6.16. vers. 20. and dispised him in her heart, saying in derision, O how glorious was the King of Israell this day,
                  Or vaine man.

               ANSWER.
               IF the long and eager contentions of this Church had all proceeded from a pardonable difference in lighter things, the church of England might easelye haue hoped for a peace, but had little cause to haue cōmended their Zeale, who were willing so vehemētly

to dissent vpon small occasions, there is litle hope that wee should possesse any great portion of inheritance in Gods church who haue not learned in patience to possesse our owne soules.In Math. 5. Saint Chrisostome maketh certain steps of this vertue (a vertue that none want which possesse charitye) for charitye is patient, it suffereth long, it is not puffed vp, it suffereth all things, It beleueth all things,1. Cor. 13.4. it hopeth all things, it indureth all things, the first steppe is not to offer wrong, the second, not to reuenge it vpon our equals; the third, not to returne the like, but to bee quiet: the fourth, to ascribe the desert of what we suffer to our selues: the fift, to yeeld our selues to him that doth euill: the sixt, not to hate him: the seauenth to loue him: the eight, to doe good to him: the last, to pray for him. Thus whatsoeuer wee suffer, shall bee a medicine, not a punishment. But haue you delt thus? nay haue you not complained of persecution, whilst men in authoritie haue, with griefe of heart, but executed those lawes which were made for the Churches peace? haue you not sought boastingly to countenance your opinions, by as learned men (in your iudgement) as this age hath knowne?

Doubtlesse the inconstancy of these men (so often varying both in Doctrine and Discipline, allowing what immediatly they mislike, subscribing to what they disprooue) hath laide from the mouth of our aduersaries those blemishes vpon this Church, as if vncertaintie and error were the onely supporters of our truth, whereas if seueritie of lawes had wrought a generall vniformitie in this Church, might wee not with ioynt handes haue encountered our aduersaries with a compleat armie: who in the meane time looking with pleasure vpon the violence of some amongest vs, are readie to afford coales and breath vnto that fire, wherein without carefull prouidence our Church of necessitie must needs perish.

And if euill, how can it be compared to the counsell of Hushay which doubtlesse was from God to ouerthrow the dangerous and irreligious counsell that Achitophel gaue?2 Sam 17, there cannot be in my opinion a greater commendation to this aduise, then that it should be like the counsaile of Hushay, whome God stirred vp to releiue Dauid, let others affect vnto themselues the

Commendation and end that Achitophell had, but God grant vnto the King now & euer, both for the Church and Commonweale,2, Sam. 17.14. such as Hushay was. For dowbtlesse the Counsell of Hushay the Archite, is better then the Counsell of Achitophell.

               I doe easily thinke that it may be farre otherwise then you sweare, if you mean by Subiectes, either the most, or the wisest, or the most Religious in this Land. Who vndoubtedly haue receiued farre greater griefe at the death of our late Soueraigne, when mercy looking vpon the misery of this Land preuented our gratious King with the blessings of goodnesse, and set a crown of pure golde vpon his head,Psa. 21.3. so that the Nations that are round about vs, may say, as Hyram when hee heard the words of Salomon; Blessed be the Lord this day, which hath giuen vnto DAVID a wise Son ouer this mighty people;1. King. 5.7. vnto Queene ELIZABETH an heire of her owne house and linage full of religion, wisdome and vnderstanding. As

also their iust sorrow for that mourning and desolation through all our Kingdome, when the most part was stroken with a plague, like the tenth plague of Aegypt, when there were few houses, wherein there were not some dead. When the mutuall comfort of friends was denyed, the hearing of Gods word was as much as the hazard of mans life, these surelye were greater griefs in your memorye then that for which you swear: but besides, I see not how it can come within the compasse of your knowledge, that neuer any thing more greeued the Subiectes, then the present course against the Ministers. The releefe whereof, would bee so farre from gratifying any that were wise, vertuous, or experienced in the troubles of these times (vnlesse some sewe ingaged in the same tempest) as that it would threaten danger to the Prince, prophanesse to the Land, Barbarisme to learning, confusion to all stares, and (without an infinite mercie) vtter ruine and desolation both to the Church and the commonwealth. We take not vpon vs to aduise his excellent Maiestie, but power out our prayers, that al blessings, by his loue to the Church may in his daies bee powred vpon his childrens children, and that peace may be vpon Israell.
            
            
               APOLOGY.
               WHat can I say more? the Lord God, the God that hath made your Maiestie so great a King, inspire your heart with his owne Counsell in these things, and giue vs grace and wisdome to obey and suffer, as we ought.
            
            
               
               ANSVVER.
               TO this with the plentifull addition of all graces, the whole Church of great Brittain lying prostrate at his Maiesties feet doth say, Amen. Amen.
               
            
            
               APOLOGY.
               ANd for my selfe if your Maiesty wil pardon this boldnes, and grant me to liue yet vnder your protection, though in a priuate life, and free me in your thoughts from the blot of dishonestie, I shall promise in the word of a Christian by all meanes to studie the peace of the Church, and to poure out my soule in daily prayers for your excellent Maiestie, and all your blessed posteritie, that God may continue these kingdomes vnder your Highnesse, and yours till Christ shall come and end all in one.
               
                  
                     Your Maiesties Loyall and humble vassall, Iohn Burges.
               
            
            
               ANSVVER.
               IF this resolution continue, you need not doubt but to finde mercy, but wisedom would consult whether it be lawfull first to disobey, and then to forsake your calling, and liue a priuate life: it were lamentable that the state of our Church were such, as that men to auoid the seuerity of her superstitious laws had no other safetie for their conscience, but to forsake their functions, we know better of her, and we will hope better things of you, then you should thinke or write thus.
            
         
         
            
            CERTAINE REASONS, BY VVAY OF AN Apology, deliuered to the Right Reuerend Father in God, the Lord Bishoppe of LINCOLNE, by IOHN BVRGES. Wherein hee laboureth to proue, that hauing heretofore subscribed foure tymes, and now refusing to subscribe (as a thing vnlawfull) that he hath (notwithstanding) done lawfully in both.
            
               ¶ The Preface of the APOLOGY.
               
                  RIGHT Reuerend Father in God, according to my promise made vnto your Lordshippe, at our conuention, before you on the third of October, and since by Letters, I now present vnto you my determinate answere, and therein my refusall of such subscription, as your Lordshippe and the late Canons doe require. And because it will seeme strange

that I should now stick at subscription; who haue already foure times subscribed, I craue leaue to performe vnto your Lordshipe a true and sincere report of what I haue yeelded vnto, as of what I now refuse, and the reasons of both. And because there goe many rumors and some copies, and both (perhaps) false of my late subscriptions.
                     The now most reuerend L. Archbishopp his grace of Canterberrie.
                   I pray leaue to set downe those very words, which acquired (as from the King) I sent by maister Deane of the Ch
                     •
                  ppell vnto his excellent Maiestie; and the report of that which I afterward performed before my Lord of London.
            
            
               ANSVVER.
               
                  THere is little hope in the sequell of this Apology to find that submission and humility, which were requisite in the Ministers of Christ, when one of inferiour place dare aduenture to make a determinate answere of refusal to subscribe, hauing notwithstanding before subscribed, and yet maintaineth that he is lawfully warranted to do both; doubtlesse if it had but beene the obedience to a priuate bishoppe in his own Dyoces, ought we not rather to haue yeelded thē either to haue incurred the suspicion of cōtempt, or to haue hazarded by suspension, the vse of our ministery? But when by your confession it was that Subscription which his Lordship and the Canons did both require you giue a singuler testimonie of his Lordshippes Episcopall vigelancie, and withall, runne into suspition of singuler contempt, vnlesse, your reasons being examined,

do prooue good: for except the inferiour Clergy be obedient to the Bishoppe, and the Bishoppes to the Metropolitane,
                  
                     Tot essent scisma. ta quot sacerdotes. Hiero. contr. Lucif.
                   
                  there would bee (saith S. Hierome) as many Scismes as Priests.
               
               And one of the most modest and most learned that seemeth to fauour the cause of discipline maketh it a principall poynt of the ecclesiasticall gouerment; that the Inferior clergye in things honest be obedient to the Bishop,
                  
                     
                        Vt peculiarem promitterent obedientiam, in rebus honestis suo Episcopa et Episcopi Metrapolitano.

                  and the Bishoppe to the metropolitan, so that you not onlye refusing obedience in this vnto the Bishopp but violating those canons wherevnto in ther intendiment you gaue consent, & which doubtles being so lawfully authorised was the whole church of England by representation, you had need to afford good reasons of this refusall or else to account this refusal a great sin, which the rather I doubt not but your wisdome will be carefull to avoyde as being not onlye to render an account of your owne obedience but to do it being required by so humble, so learned, so vertuous a King, who in the midst of the greatest affaires of his realme vouchsafeth in his vsuall and extraordinarye loue to his cleargie, to respect you and to require your answere by their message who if they had spoken in their own names, deserued verye much to haue bene reuerenced by yow.
            
            
               APOLOGY.
               MY Answere to his Maiesties demaunds, touching the discipline, Ceremonies, and Subscription. I doe thinke and beleeue, touching the gouernment of the Church by Bishops, as with vs in Englād, or by ruling Elders, as in other Churches of God, that neither of them was prescribed by the

Apostles of Christ; neither of them is repugnant to the word of God, but may well and profitably bee vsed, if more fault bee not in the persons, then in the callings themselues.
               
                  2 Secondly, I doe hold and am perswaded of the Crosse and Surplesse,
                     I prayed the Deane to Interpret my self for one of those vnto his Maiestie.
                   that as our Church vseth them, they bee not vnlawfull, though in some men and places, so inexpedient, as that (I thinke) no mans ministery likely to do so much good, as some mens sodaine vse of them might doe hurt.
               
                  3 Thirdly, for the subscription to the Articles of 62. as the Lawe requireth it, and to his Maiesties Supremacie, I approue it without any exception or qualification. And touching the third Article, about the booke of Common Prayer, and booke of Ordination, doe holde, that howsoeuer they haue some things in them, which cannot simply bee allowed, as false translations, &c. Yet, considered in the purpose, and intention of the Church of England, and reduced to the propositions it publickly professeth, they containe nothing contrarie to the word of God, and in witnesse that this is my vnfained Iudgement in the premises, I haue set to my name this second of Iuly 1604. and will be alwaies ready to professe at his Maiesties command.
            
            
               ANSVVER.
               I doubt not, but you haue well examined what you haue here set downe, and wise men in cases of this moment, deale not like vnwise builders, but cast their account before hand. Wee heare your opinion, which it pleaseth you to call your vnfained Iudgment,my vnfeyned Iudgment. concerning Discipline, Ceremonies; and Subscription, matters oftentimes handled before, as be also the most things set downe by you, wherein we must craue pardon,

if we alledge our owne words, euen in that which we haue been occasioned to answere in another Treatise;
                     Post malam segetem serendum est, soepe quicquid perierat Infoelicis solisterelitate, vnius anni restituit vbertas. Senec.
                   for wisdome telleth vs that it is necessarie to sowe againe after an euill haruest, seeing oftentimes that which perisheth by the barrennes of some badground, is abundantly restored in the fertility of some one year that followeth. In your first, concerning the gouernment of the Church (which you call discipline) neither is it vndetermined what was prescribed by the Apostles of Christ, nor what succession of Bishops was continued in all Churches, euen from their time, so that it must needes seeme strange, that the gouernment by Elders or by Bishoppes should in your opinion, be a thing so indifferent, as that neither beeing prescribed by the Apostles of Christ, neither of them repugnant to the word of God, may wel & profitably be both vsed. It seemeth strāge to my vnderstanding, that after so many sharpe conflictes for the discipline of the Churh, after such bitter inuectiues against the authority of Bishops; After so confident commendation of the gouernment by Elders maintained, as onely warrantable and inioyned out of Gods word; fancies wherwith ye haue filled the Church for this fifty yeares, that you should now confesse neither to be cōmaunded, neither to bee repugnant to Gods word. What meant the demonstration of discipline, and others, to indeauour to proue the gouernment by Elders not to bee the inuention of wise men, and not against the word of God, but to be the expresse commaundement (in euery particuler) of GOD himselfe, accounting those to haue no Church (this being as essential as either the Word or Sacraments) where this is wanting: What meant the

vehement commendations of this discipline, in a booke called the Humble Motion,
                  
                     Pag. 31.27.74.64. that if this were established, God would blesse our victuals and satisfie our poore with bread, that he would cloath our Priests with health, and his Saints should shout for ioy, that it is best and surest for our state; that it would cut off contentions and suites of Law; that it would norish learning; that then there would bee vnity in the Church, that it would bee strength and victorie and many other benefits like these. Why haue they striuen so earnestly for it, if it were not absolutely commaunded in Gods word,
                     Quod de scripturis sacris authoritatem non habet eadem facilitate contemnitur qua probatur. Hier. in Mat. 26. which seing you now denye, giue me leaue to tell you, we will henceforth be bolde with Saint Hierom (seing it wanteth this warrant) to reiect it with the same facility that it is alledged. And wee hope (seeing it is not commaunded in the Scripture) that they will for euer now cease to poyson the Church with such opinions, or to couer the policy of their first teachers, with the vnhallowed contentions of all after-times. But though you haue dealt so liberally with vs for the gouernment of Elders, yet we dare not doe so with you in the gouernment of Bishops. For, if Clement saide true (whome Polidore alledgeth to that end) that Peter in euery Prouince appointed one Archbishoppe, whome all other Bishops in the same Prouince should obey, if the name of Archbishoppe and Bishoppe were not so vnusuall, that Volusianus was not afraid to say,
                     Volustanus wrot. Anno. 855. that Dynosius Areopagita was by S. Paule made Archbishoppe of Athens; or Erasmus to call Titus Archbishop of Creete, or Eusebius to giue the authority to Iohn the Euāgelist,
                     Euseb lib. 5. cap. 23. who suruiuing the rest, brought this benefit vnto the Church, that for cōsecrating

of Bishops, & other vses, he was the Archbishop or Metropolitan to the whole Church; for the Bishops (as Epiphanius reasoneth) begot fathers in the Church,Haeres. 75. but the Presbiters (only) begot sons.Bilson. If this was the perpetual gouernment of the Church (as that thrise learned & most reuerend Bishop hath proued) euen from the Apostles time, we dare not say as you do, that it hath but a tollerable alowance equall to Elders, and that neither being repugnant, the Church may lawfully imbrace either.
               
               2 Concerning the second point, touching Ceremonies (you name only the Crosse and the Surp
                        •
                     ice) these you hold lawfull; for so (I thinke) you meane, when you say (they be not vnlawfull) being vsed as our Church doth, but yet notwithstanding in some men & places so inexpedient, as that you thinke no mans Ministery likely to do so much good as some mens sodaine vse of them might doe hurt. Consider (I pray you) the substance of these word
                     •
                  , the things are lawfull as our Church vseth them.
                  1. Cor. 12. 1. Cor. 10.23. What then? inexpedient, that is in respect of some circumstances not conuenient to be vsed
                  ▪ a discretion attending vpon things indifferent by the Apostles aduice (all things are lawfull, but all things are not expedient) euen then restraining the vse, when it is like that the vsage will doe much hurt. This hurt you set downe to be, that no mans Ministery is likely to do so much good, as some mens sodaine vse of them might do hurt. Is this your determinate iudgement of these things deliuered vnder your hand vnto the king? It is like (nay, doubtles it is more then like) for it is sure (otherwise most lamentable were the cōdicion of this land) that the Ministery of some men shal be able to saue soules (for that Gospel which we preach,Rom. 1. is the power of god vnto saluatiō)

now, what hurt can you thinke of, equall to this good, peraduenture the destruction of soules, and doe you thinke in earnest,Ioh. 10.29. that this scandall will be the destruction of mens soules?2. Cor. 2.16. Well, what are they? are they elect? then I am sure you will say they cannot fall; for Christ saith,
                     
                        In quantum possumus proximorū scandalum vitave debemus.
                     
                     
                        Si de veritate scādalum oritur, satius est vt illius scandal um nascitur, quam veritas relinquatur. Hiero. in Math.
                     
                   
                  No man shall take them out of his hands, are they otherwise giuen ouer to a reprobate sence? to such euen the Gospel it self is the sauor of death vnto death. I confesse, wee are to auoid scandall in what we may, but better it is, that that should arise, then betray the truth, and (peraduenture) by conformity and obedience, your Ministery would receiue those blessings which now it wanteth.
               But howsoeuer, seeing the number can neither bee many, the most part of our Land being better instructed vnder the long gouernment of the most vertuous Prince that euer England had, before it had her, nor the danger great, being but the Scandall of such, who are not willing to seeme weake, and therfore I suppose, wee neede not bee afraid to say contrarie to that which you affirme: that many mens Ministerie is likely to doe more good then yours, or any mans sodaine vse of the Ceremonies can doe hurt.
               
               3 The third thing, whereunto you answered, was Subscription, and in this, to some things without limitation, as to the Kings Supremacie,
                     Anno 13. &c.
                   to others with, and in both, as the lawe requireth. It hath beene the vsual euasion of a great number, to pretend an obedience to the lawe, in subscribing, whilest (notwithstanding) they were not willing to subscribe, as the Lawe required. Surely there can be little hope of peace in the outward gouernmēt of that Church, where the leaders

of others are not willing or think it not lawfull, to be obedient, neither can there be any one act in the obseruation of all wise men more avayleable, and in reason more likelye to procure this then Subscription, which tyeth the tongue & hands from any way resisting those lawfull ordinances, that preserue peace, all other creatures obserue that law which their maker appointed for them,Psal. 148.6. 
                  for he hath giuen them a law which shall not be broken: This being the reproofe of man (saith Saint Ambrose) but most of all of vs of the Cleargie,In Hexamer. who being the children of the Church, nay, fathers in Christ to beget others, are notwithstanding disobedient vnto those lawes which in great wisedome for her owne safety the Church hath made. It is dangerous when we say: Surely we will walke after our owne imaginations, and doe euery man after the stubbernnes of his wicked heart.
                  Ier. 28.1. But wee finde in you a better show of comformity then in many others, who professing to subscribe to his Maiesties Supremacy without exception or qualification, cannot in reason but yeild obedience vnto the lawes which are all of them authorized from his mouth, & for the censure of the communiō Booke, notwithstanding you thinke something to bee faultie in it, yet (wee desire you to remember it) considered in the intention of the Church of England, and reduced to the propositions which it publikely professeth,
                  Subscription being a kind of oath, I doubt whether priuate men haue power to make their own limitation. 
                  it contayneth nothing contrarie to the word of God. This then being your approbation vnder your hand, doe you not think it lawful to alow by subscription what you think lawfull? The truth of those things whereunto you haue beene required to subscribe, hath forced a confession of their lawfulnesse, euen from the mouthes

of her greatest aduersaries, and yet for all this, because they would be to others examples of disobedience, they haue refused to subscribe, to thrust others of lesse learning & greater moderation into the like contempt. This being (as one noteth) the principal vnhappines of those men,
                     Authoritatem habent senum, 
                           •
                        . tia pueroru

                  that they had the authoritie of the aged, and the faults of youth. Who being in this (as they thought) to publish their vertue were supposed not without cause to affect glory.
            
            
               APOLOGY.
               A Weeke after I was called before the Bishop of London, the Deane of the Chappell being with him, and (after many sharpe rebukes for my Sermon preached before his Maiestie) vrged to subscribe to the three articles; we stood a time in clearing some exceptions then taken: at last, I prayed leaue to write downe the same limitation which I had written to his Maiestie, and then read before them. Which being denyed as idle and needlesse to be exprest, because it was alwaies implied and vnderstood, I (taking them both and God to witnes that I did subscribe in the same sence, and with the same limitations that I had expressed in that sent vnto his Maiesty) did then subscribe. This done, I pretested vnto them that I had in the some manner, and with the same protestation subscribed twise before, yet wished that my present subscription might not be diuulged, but as I my selfe should open it, least I should be thoght to haue done that at this time out of feare, & for desire of inlargment (which God knew, I had done according to my iudgement) & so become lesse profitable in my calling, & lesse able to satisfie other men. The bishop replied that the King must know it, otherwise for his part it should be concealed,

which the Deane also promised as well as he, I answered that I knew well his Maiestie must know it, and cared not who knew it but in the former respect, and that my selfe would make it knowne, (which thing I did the same houre and neuer yet denyed) beseeching them to informe his Maiestie that I had done no more now then before, least his Maiesty should thinke me caried by feare as a man of an euill conscience, which they both promised to doe: his Lordship and Master Deane then exhorted me to conformitie in practise, I answered, that for my iudgement of the ceremonies, they knew it (as did also many of the ministers) amongest whom I had at sundry conferences discouered and maintayned my opinion of their lawfulnes: but for practise, I should yeilde to haue them vsed in my cure, but in my owne person who had neuer vsed them, and once lost my place for not vsing them, I durst not promise it (at least) vntill I had done what I could to preuent offence. Two daies after this, I was called againe before the Bishop to be discharged of mine imprisonment by order from his Maiesties Counsell. At what time the Bishop exhorted me to conforme my selfe, and perswade other men, for conformitie I besought his Lordship not to expect it at my hands, nor to say, I doubled with him, if I performed it not so long as the feare of scandall should restraine me, adding that his Lordship might gaine much honour to himselfe, and peace to the Church by shewing compassion vpon the ministers in a few lighter things, when their hearts were so inclinde to peace, his Lordship replied that I should haue time to teach and satisfie my people, I answered that I did not so much feare the offence of those, with whom I now liue, as of other places where I had liued. And as touching the satisfying of other men I tolde him, I might not vndertake to perswade, but

would be readie vpon any occasion to professe freely what I thought, as I had done alreadie at sundrie conferences, and that I had that day receiued some obiections of a friend in writing, to which I had promised Answer. His Lordship wished to see the arguments, but I craued pardon, bycause they were committed to me from a friend, and vpon trust, he then required to see mine answer before I should send it to my friend, which I yeilded vnto, and haue not yet broken, for I neuer sent answer to it, nor euer shall. And this my Lord to my best remembrance is the whole summe of that which I haue done, and the world speaketh of so much, and diuersly out of all which this summe ariseth: First, that I haue foure times subscribed to the Booke of common prayer with limitation and reference of all things therein contayned, vnto the purpose and doctrine of this Church of England, and limitation I eyther wrote down or protested before witnesse: Secondly, that I neuer promised present conformitie in practise, howsoeuer I confessed the ceremonies not simply vnlawfull, as I did since also before your Lordship.
            
            
               ANSVVER.
               IT is the desire of all men who are willing to continue the reputation without wrong, to be able to giue account of what they doe, and to render a reason of what they speake. The narration of your behauiour and trouble, as also your opinion concerning conformitie with this Church, as we haue receiued it vnder your owne hand, so wee desire leaue without offence to obserue some few things materiall to this end, and although your reducing the summe of the whole storie to those two heads: first, that you haue foure

times subscribed to the booke of common praier with limitation and reference of all things therein contayned vnto the purpose and doctrine of this Church of England. Secondly, that you neuer promised conformitie in practise, howsoeuer you confessed the ceremonies not simply vnlawfull; be the principall things contayned in it; yet, because some other things are pertinent to this cause, wee will rather examine then answer what you haue alleadged.
               1 You haue yeilded to subscribe with limitatiō, which limitation is the purpose and intention of the Church of England, a caueat (doubtlesse) not needful to be expressed, seeing it is the same Church that requireth subscription, who would not haue any within her own bosom require an allowance to the fancies & opinions that others hould. And peraduenture wise men will thinke that the distinctions found out, are but euasions do what they would not seeme, whilst in the meane time they might lurke vnder some equiuocall cloud as the Iesuits doe.
               2 Further, you desire that your present subscription might not bee diuulged, but as your selfe might open it, a thing you see both yeilded vnto, and performed by those, in whose power it was but doubtfull what intention you had, in concealing of it; I can easily afford you so much charity as to thinke it was, least some sinister and false collections might be deriued from it, whilest some others (peraduenture) more probably think, that you meant to beare your brethren in hand, that you yeilded not so farre as in truth ye did. Consider if the concealement of this subscription haue not some proportion with the hypocricy of

                  Saul,
                  1. Sam. 15, 30. but honour me I pray thee before the elders of my people: and that which you feare would be taken to be an euil conscience, could not (but in the iudgement of so wise a Prince) be thought an obedient and an humble mind.
               3 The third thing is, that notwithstanding your allowance of these ceremonies, yet you could not conforme your selfe, but would willingly allow the practise of them by some other, euen in your owne cure, this in my apprehension doth seeme strange, for seeing your flocke haue that good opinion of you as is fit for sheepe to haue of their pastor, and that you feare not any scandal amongst them (as your selfe afterward confessed) your example might haue remooued both from them & others neare vnto you all offence (if there were any) who peraduenture might haue stumbled at the same things being vsed by others, and scandal being so, dangerous is not fit to be offered by a Curate.
               4 Fourthly, you intreat compassion towards the ministers in a few lighter things. Let me tell you that mildnesse in some other cases may be a vertue, but in this a vice: and surely he fayleth in his episcopall courage, who through remisnesse or pitie suffereth the lawes of the Church (by being wilfully broken) to be vnhallowed disturbers of the Churches peace, and surely if the vrging of subscription which the law required, haue beene the cause of the seuerall dissentions in our Church, a worse effect could not haue proceeded from so good a cause, then that that which was a vertuous inuention to make peace, by the vnquiet disposition of some few should become the originall fountaine of so much warr. Besides, experience telleth vs that the mildnes which that Reuerend Archbishop

                  Grindall vsed in those times little auailed with those men for to make them better, and the last Archbishop of famous memory found it to be most true that such as were spared eyther from his owne compassion,Whitgif

               5 Fiftly, you feare not so much the offence of those with whom you do now liue, as of other places where you haue liued.In Norwick. This can be no good pretence for disobediēce in this case, seeing they by your example were most fit to be resolued of the true lawfulnesse of those things,An alteration in the intent and purpose of the Church of England, in requiring subscription. of whose suspected vnlawfulnes they first grew iealous by your doctrine, who since I hope haue been better taught.

Neither did I mistake (if mistake) that point alone, for there be many, some of geeat place that vrging subscription and conformity, neuer sticke to say that authority ought to remoue some things, and sinneth, in not doing it, thereby shewing that they thinke not Subscription to approue the voluntary imposition, but the compelled obseruation of some things in the booke.

A change in you, not in opinion, but in obedience can no way be iustified, but by an accusation of our whole state, as if that now vpon the sodaine, wee varied and declyned, not from the doctrine, but from the intention and purpose, that the Church had. Wee accept very willingly, that which you haue graunted, & which no aduersaries to this Church, shal be euer able to disproue, that as the foundation of our doctrine is the vnchangeable word of truth, so it is & hath beene like the author thereof, God himselfe, euer constant and the same: neither can the vsuall imputations of difference laid by our aduersaries, bee any blemish to vs, seeing those things wherein wee dissent are rather

the opinions of some few, then the setled consent of the whole Church. It seemeth you haue hitherto mistaken what subscription was, supposing it to import an Admonition of things so farre tollerable, that men not otherwise priudiced, might lawfully vse them beeing imposed. Where priuate fancies aduēture to interpret the limitations of their own obedience, the wisdome of those that make lawes, shall haue little vse, & men disposed not to obey wil find colorable excuses (vnder pretence of being preiudiced) for that which they do refuse: could any man think Subscription to be a Tolleration, onely of things not to be approued, and not rather an allowance of things to be tollerated, the intention (doubtles) of the Church in this, was not to require a tolleration or approbation frō you, or any inferior, of such things as were thought fit for the Church to commād, but to tye the tongues and the hands of all men, from disturbing the Churches quiet, & frō any way resisting those lawful ordinations that preserue peace.Rom. 13. It cannot bee the duety of inferiours to examine with what reason lawes are made (seing other places & times wherein they are interessed, are appointed to that end) but only by obedience, to giue an allowance, & by subscribing an approbation to what the lawes command; which either by way of tolleration to indure without approbation, or in show to approue without an harty allowance, were subtilly (by conformity) to procure their owne peace, and dangerously, when occasion should serue,Cano. 36. to disturbe the Church. Would any man do that vnder his hand, which he is loath to be commanded to doe ex animo
                  ▪ surely, it cannot be seuerity in that lawe, which requireth the heart to consent to what the hand

But many things (say you) are in the Communion booke, which may be tollerated, but not approued:

But first to thinke the opposition ought necessarily to be so great betwixt them and vs, as that nothing were now lawfull for vs that were vsed by them were peraduenture to traduce to

our posteritie without cause, as the corrupters of all religion in all parts, and to denie vnto our selues the iust furtherances of pietie and holines, onely because Idolatrie and superstition had corrupted those meanes amongst them, but if neither they esteeme so of the Crosse, that the transiant signe (as you call it) is to be worshipped with deuine worship, nor that we haue proportioned our selues in the same ceremonie to the supposed or manifest Idolatrie amongest them: The iniury must needes bee accounted greate vpon an opinion of zeale, to wound euen through the sides of her enemie, the vitall partes of that Church that doth giue vs life. Peter Martyr (from whence it seemeth you haue taken this accusation) saith that the Church of Rome teach,
                     Part. 2. cap. 5. 
                  That the signe of the Crosse is to be worshipped with Latreia. Which surely by him was vnderstood not of the signe transiant, but of that verie crosse, whereon Christ suffered, which they make a relicke, we will not stand to examine their errour in this point,

                      imag. cap. 22. onely let me put you in mind what Bellarmin saith, That it is not to be taught that any Images are to be worshipped Latreia. And to this end he alleadgeth the authoritie of diuers councels. What then must wee say to your reason which is grounded vpon that which they say not? but we will suppose, seeing Peter Martyr doth ioyne with you that it was their opinion, although they haue reclaimed it at this day, must it therefore needs follow, that eyther it is so vsed by vs, or by vs not lawfull to be vsed at all? hath there beene any greater idolatrie in the Church of Rome, then that which they exhibiting to the bread in the Supper, vpon an opinion of Transsubstantiation haue therewith vnhallowed

and prophaned the blessed Sacrament, and yet may not wee (nay ought wee not) lawfully to retaine it as a thing holy? Nay, Peter Martyr himselfe confesseth, whom sundry times you alleadge as your patron in this cause, That the signe of the Crosse is worne by Princes vpon their crownes without superstition, because by that signe, they onely testifie and professe that they honour and maintaine the religion of Christ. But peraduenture you will say wee ought not to make it a significatiue ceremonie to expresse that warfare which wee vndertake when we are baptized:
                     Loc. Com. part. 2. cap. 5.20 heare what he saith: If it bee lawfull for a man to beare in his armes the badge of his owne famimily: It is also lawful for him by the signe of the crosse to professe Christian Religion, there is some difference from them whilst we vse it in Baptisme which you giue vs occasion fitly to handle in another place, onely let me tell you, that if the Papists worship the Crosse more than they ought, must the Church of England neglect the vse thereof more then the ancient Churcher haue done, or then any moderate and wise Christians would do, who glory in nothing so much as the crosse of Christ, which was not vnderstood of afflictions (although wee may glory in them) but euen of the sufferings of Christ vpon that crosse whereon he died.See the Reue.

                     . Neither hath the crosse as it is vsed in our Church any proportion eyther with the brasen Serpent, when it was broken, or the groues forbidden, seeing the one continued vntill it was strangely prophaned by insence from their handes,Deut▪ 16.2

                     . who were not allowed at any time to offer any, and the groues not simply forbidden, but when they were neare the altar.

In this respect vertuously restraint hath beene made of the ouer frequent vse of that signe tending to Idolatry, to auoid superstition, and yet a discreete admission of some vse thereof, to eschew prophannesse. Neyther can we commend your vnwillingnesse to approue the Reuerend Fathers of the Church for the continuance of these things, seeing they had power to helpe them, we will not examin their power (wee wish it were farre greater) we know their discretion and wisedome hath and shall infinitly beenefit the Church by the late Canons; and for those who peraduenture allow the things as you speake, but approoue not the commaunding of them, we must say as Saint Austin doth,
                     Non est amicus recti quando si fieri posset mallet id quod rectum est non fieri. Aust. inps. 66. 
                  he is not a friend to the truth, who had rather if it were possible that that which is truth were not commaunded. Neyther is the warre about these things so needlesse as you thinke, seeing it is like that if euer there were out of milde patience strongly and vehemently (euen with much hypocrisie) importuned any truce, the Church hath receiued more hurt by that, then by all the seueritie which requiring obedience doth bring peace.

Yea (my Lord) who can with iudgement allow the ordayning of any Apocripha to be read in the congregation, in such sort as it is appointed, that is, at the same times with the Scriptures, vnder the name of Holy Scripture, as partes of the old Testament, and as parts of diuine seruice, and without any manner of difference or distinction, for when as the booke prescribing to say onely at the reading of the Lessons,Rubrick.

And if Hierom, translating some of them, did giue them a brand of difference, why should not we in the reading? Or if the elder brother suffer not the yonger to giue the armes of his house without a Crescent to distinguish them, how will God (that is so Iealous of his Honour) put it vp, that wee put no sensible difference betwixt the children of his spirit, and the baser sonnes of men (though good men).Pag. 60. In which cause (my Lord) I am the more earnest, because I finde at the Conference Hierom taxed for calling them Apocripha; and there (though not truely, for Cyril did it before him) saide to bee the first that so termed them, and his exceptions called the old euils of the Iewes, and I find thē also tearmed Canonicall ad mores, as if any writing but

Gods could be properly Canonical, which is co ipso canonica quo authentica, as D. Whitaker well saith, which make one feare, that which I am loth to feare or speake, must make me by so much the more afraid of allowing their admission, by how much they incroch vpon the prerogatiues royoll of the Scriptures, eyther in titles or in vsage.

That then which you mislike in this place (for the rest wee shall indeuour to defend, when wee come vnto them) is the reseruation, euen of the parcels of those Chapters, some parts whereof we reiect as drosse, that is, to summe vp your whole accusation in few words, that no Apocripha is publikely to be read in diuine seruice. The Church of Christ according to her authoritie receiued from him, hath warrant to approoue the Scriptures,D. Whitaker. to acknowledge, to receiue, to publish and to commaund vnto her children: so then, that the Scriptures are true to vs, wee haue it from the Church, but that we beleeue them as true in themselues, we haue it from the holy Ghost. By this power the Church hath severed those parcels of Scripture by the name of Apocripha from those, which vndoubtedly were penned from Gods Spirit. In this diuision, neyther hath the light nor the approbation beene all one, seeing euen some partes penned by the holy Ghost, (and so now generally approued both by the Church

of Rome and vs) haue had some difficulty, not without great examination to be admitted into the Catalogue of Gods Canon. As the Epistle to the Hebrewes, of S. Iames, the second of Peter, the second and third of Iohn, the Epistle of Iude, and the Reuelation. And howsoeuer those that were neuer doubted of, may seeme to haue (in some sort) greater authoritie then those that were:

Zanchy) equall credit with the rest, and to the Apocripha, the next place of all other to the holy Scripture. The Canonical only wee allow for probation of the doctrine of Faith, but the other (being proued) for the confirmation therof: Nay, the Church of Rome confesseth (howsoeuer they and wee differ,

               Saint Austin calleth by a larger acceptation of the word Canonicall, euen those, which though they had not perfect and certaine authority, yet accustomably were read in the Church, to edefie the people: a custome (as it seemeth) neither now, nor differing from the practise of our Church.

For other Fathers, although they accounted them Apocripha, yet they permitted them to be read. And Saint Hierome speaketh of the booke of wisdome and of Ecclesiasticus (out of which two is more read in our seruice then out of al the Apocripha besides) that they may be reade to the edification

vs fitter to pray. To read scriptures in the time of diuine seruice, wee hope being auncient and of such vse, their wisdom will not much mislike,

                   & if the name of epistle doe offend, you cannot but know that the originall of this (both for the name and the thing) was from Paule himselfe, commanding the same Epistle which he sent vnto the Collossians to be read in the Church of the Laodiceans, and of that to the Thessalonians (he saith) I charge you in the Lord that this Epistle be read vnto all the brethren the Saints▪ from which custome the Church hauing appoynted that portion of scripture, whether out of the prophets, Acts of the Apostle, or Reuelation, which circumstances considered, was thought then fittest to be read vnto the people, as if it were sent directlye vnto them, thereby procuring their attention, is not vnfitly tearmed by the name of Epistle: to these as Saint Chrisostome noteth, the minister stood vp and cryed with a loude voyce. Let vs attend: this practise hath resemblance to the practise of the Iewes euen vntill this daye, amongst whome some thing is read euerye Sabboth out of Moses, or the prophets, besides these, if any thing offend through the seueritye of some expositions (as what scripture so holye that some expositions will not corrupt) wee desire more charitye at their hands, seing the cause wee defend is the Honour of our church, the wisdome of our forefathers, the worship of God, and not our owne wils, for which onlye if our Reuerend fathers had been ingaged, they would (I doubt not long since) rather haue relinquished their owne right, then with so much preiudice haue hazarded the Churches peace: as for the Church of Rome, we are so farre from being vnwilling, that they should

ingrosse our speeches, as that wee daily and heartily pray, that they would in all thinges both thinke and speake as wee do.
               And if you, or any other (notwithstanding all this) shall labour to make the world beleeue, that the courage of Bishops for defence of the Church, is but a stifnesse in their owne quarrels, wee must let the world vnderstand, which we know to be true, that greater moderation and patience ioyned with carefull thoughts of what was to be altered, hath by many degrees more appeared in them, then in the meanest of the Cleargie besides, wherewith if you cannot rest content, but desire them to followe the Counsell of Trent, in the alteration of these things,

In general (acknowledging the booke to be a good and godly booke: I take exception at that new imposition of the Canons, which doth absolutely command against all exceptions the whole Lyturgy to be read euery Sabboth, and that at the vsuall houres. The Booke at the first, was ordained in part to supply the want of a learned ministery, and (vntill now) some parts might be omitted lawfully for a Sermon, as the Lord Cheefe Iustice of England iudged lately at Thetford in Norfolke in Tylneys
                  
case. And in this intention, who could condemne the Churches godly care of supplying some meanes of Gods seruice, where all could not bee at once prouided? But this intention is so changed, that by the Canons, no peece of the seruice must giue way to a Sermon, or any other respect, which computed with the accessorie occasions of Christinings, Buryals, mariages, and Communions, which fall out all at sometimes, some at all times in many congregations, doth necessarily pretend if not a purpose, yet a consequence of diuorsing Preaching and so not widowes houses, but Gods house, vnder pretence of long prayers, while neither the time, nor the ministers strength, nor peoples patience can beare that taske of reading and preaching to, of which intention, if we be afraid, who can maruell, that either shall obserue my Lord of Londons motion at the conference, for a praying ministery, as more needefull in a Church planted, then Preaching, as his speech since also haue professed,

               FEw things are likely to escape vnreproued, where the best things in our Church are reprehēded, there is no duty vpon earth, that concerneth man, with a greater nearnes then prayer doth;
                     Mook. lib. 5. Sect. 23. which vsuallye expresseth euen all the seruice that wee owe vnto God; for in religiō (as one wisely noteth) there is no acceptable duty, which deuout inuocation of the name of God doth not either presuppose or inferre:Math. 21.13. neither can there be greater approbation of this action (being publick) then that the Temple being appointed for this end: in this respect God vouchsafeth, it to be accounted his house, as if Sermons, Sacrifices, Sacraments, and all other seruices performed in that place, were but second intentions for the building thereof, in respect of Prayer. Now for the better performance of this duty, the late Canons haue renewed that care which in all ages was found in the gouernours of Christes Church, that the strange desire of some few to heare themselues speake, might not banish from amongst vs an institution of that vse, a dutie of so much profit, an ordinance so holy, as if for feare to displace preaching, our Temples ought not now to be accounted a house of prayer. We must first for answere to their iniurious accusation in this case, tell them that neuer any (sauing some few & meane persons) haue disliked a forme of publike prayer; those which mislike ours, euen with the greatest seueritie that eyther malice, or (at the best) the most scrupulous conscience could inuent, haue beene able, but to alleadge some few shadowes

of faults, all which haue beene often heretofore answered, and if any in the feruencie of a zealous conscience remaine as yet vnsatisfied,

                   we will be bold to vse the words vnto him of Bishop Ridley (after his condemnation) to Master Grindall then beyond the seas. (Alas) that our brother Knox could not beare with our booke of common prayer, in matters against which, although I grant a man (as he is) of wit and learning, may finde to make apparant reasons, but I suppose he cannot be able soundly to disproue by Gods word, the reason he maketh against the Leteny, and the fault per sanguinem & sudorem, he findeth in the same. I doe marueile how he can or dare auouch them before the learned men that be with you. As for priuate Baptisme, It is not prescribed in the booke, but where solemne Baptisme for lacke of time and danger of death cannot be had, what would he in that case should be done? Peraduenture he will say, it is better then to let them die without Baptisme: For this his (better) what word hath he in the scripture? and if he haue none, why will hee not rather follow that, that the sentences of the old ancient writers doe more allow? from whom to dissent without warrant of Gods word, I cannot thinke it any godly wisedome. And as for purification of women; I ween the word purification is changed, and it is called thankesgiuing: surely Maister Knox in my mind is a man of much good learning, and of an earnest zeale, the Lord grant him to vse them to his glorie. Thus farre Bishop Ridley: Bishop of London, and a blessed Martyr, with whom, we say of a great number, they are learned, they are zealous, the Lord grant them to vse them to his glorie, for wee will confesse as Maister Bucer doth, there are not some few things wanting in the Lyturgye of England, which if they be not charitably

interpreted, may seeme to dissent from the word of God. But accessimus (as Maister Iewell confesseth) quantum maximè potuimus ad Ecclesiam Apostolorum & veterum Catholicorum Episcoporum & patrum, quam scimus adhuc suisse integram atque (vt Tertullianus ait) incorruptam vi

In al which, doubtlesse there is nothing wanting, which is requisite in a religious & reformed Church, sauing the charitable construction of our brethren, who will needs (eyther out of singularitie, or feare) bee our aduersaries in this cause. And when nothing can bee said against the forme of that Lyturgy which wee vse, they blame the orders of our Church which inioyne the whole Lyturgy to be read at the vsuall houres. And vnder pretence of long prayers to banish preaching out of the Church: I meruaile that any man will obiect it now, seing it was an vntrue imputation long since by Master Cartwright layd vpon this church (but as one telleth him) neither aduisedly nor truly spoken:
                     T. C. lib. 3. pag. 184. wee will not compare two things of that nearenes and vse together, but if some mens discretion could haue tempered their Zeale so farr, that their owne paynes (which they call Sermons) might haue beene shorter, and the orderly prayers of the church wholly read, I doubt not, but the religion of the people would haue beene much greater: the worship of God more sound, and the vnseasonable contentions of the Church farr lesse, and if they continew

but (as some before them haue done to allow) an houre & half, according to the pattern of reformed Churches, for the whole Lyturgy or seruice (wee are perswaded) it will both bee time sufficient for performing the intention of the Canon,Canon. 14. which forbiddeth all diminshing, in regard of preaching; & yet no man shal haue iust cause (if he be willing to preach) to complaine that hee wants time, or that the length of prayers hath deuoured the Church, for by this means (hauing time, which the wisdom of authority thinketh sufficient for both) all extemporall inuention of vnsounde prayer, shall bee vtterly banished out of christes Church, and in Preaching the shortnesse of time shall necessarily cut off all impertinent discourses, whilest they are sorced to comprize abundance of matter in few words.
               But if any man thinke the Communion booke at first to be ordayned in part, to supply the want of a Learned ministry, which being obtayned, may beomitted either in part or in whole, as men please; It is an error greatly mistaking the first vse; and ouermuch differing from the modesty and humility of auncient tymes; Wherein the Apostles came into the Sinagogue of the Iewes at Antioch and sat downe,Act. 13.14.15. and after the Lecture of the law, & the prophetts (which I take was their ordinary seruice) the rulers of the Sinagogues sent vnto them, saying: ye men and brethren: if ye haue any word of exhortation for the people, say on: read the ordinary marginall note vpon this place, and it will seeme that the Sermon expected the finishing of ordinary diuine seruice, as neither all waies necessarily following, when

this was, nor at any time presuming to be (vpon the Sabbath) when this was not: nor if the vnhallowed boldnesse of some in our time, hath aduentured to thrust the graue, religious, discreete, deliberate, and iudicious prayers established by authoritie out of our Churches, and forced them (against all reason) to giue place to an vnlearned, vnorderly, and bould exhortation without wisedome or sobrietie (onely somewhat glorying in the show of a hote zeale) was it not a petition necessary and seasonable, humbly at the conference to intreat of his Maiestie for a praying ministery? From the contempt whereof haue directly proceeded the prophannesse, the Atheisme, and all the want of Religion in this land, yet let no man thinke, that eyther the Canons or any of the Reuerend Fathers desire that preaching may be lesse, but rather that with all modesty God being honoured in our praiers as we ought, wee maye the better be able to profit by those lessons that sermons doe giue vnto vs. And therefore it is ouer greate boldnes of our aduersaryes in this, to accuse any man in authoritye in the church as an aduersarie to preaching,Read Can. 33.34.42.43.44.45.46.47.59. &c. seing the whole scope of sundry of these late Canons prouideth better, for more and more learned Sermons, then any lawes heretofore concluded in this Kingdome; so that wee banish not preaching for prayers as you would make the world beleeue, but saye as our Sauiour doth in another case, this ought ye to haue done, but not to haue left the other vndone.

But now the Canon (inhibiting all addition and exchange) doth not onely sylence for euer those chapters omitted, but so many moe also in our Parochiall and country Churches, where our people will not come, but on holidaies, and where reading is most needfull in publick, because

               IF the Church of England, for blessings the most happy, for learning the most sufficient, for sincerity of Religion the most reformed, and for Lawes and ordinations that concerne piety, the most vpright (be it spoken without enuie) of all the Churches of Europe at this day, haue no greater blemish to staine her with, then the drowning of the Canonicall Scripture, which you impute vnto her. Wee are and will bee euer readie (although the meanest of many thousands that liue in her bosome) to proue her Innocent. Whereas, if shee haue wilfully silenced Gods truth, and vttered vnto the people vanity and Lyes in steade thereof, wee will mourne for the sinnes of our mother, with hearty sorrowe, and not enter into the defence of so great a fault: for, God forbid, that any partiall affection to her (who whilest she is vpon earth, may erre) should make vs transgresse against our father in heauen, who is trueth it selfe, but if shee haue done nothing in this case, which well befitted not the wisdome and care of a mother (howsoeuer it please others to mistake her meaning) then let her great wisdome bee iustified of her owne children: to reade in the Church of God, the Scriptures haue beene the honour of our Liturgy, the happynes of our people, and the true and readiest directions to a better life; but either to reade them all, or onely to reade them, our forefathers (in discretion) did not think safe; seeing the one might bee to small vse, the other not without great profit, and both most agreable to the wisdome and practise of former times: for if a hundred & threescore chapters of the Canon be omitted, as you say (for we can be content to take your account

in this case) and therein some whole bookes, as the Chronicles, Canticles, & most of the Apocalipse be left out, wee nether doe in this, without warrant what otherwise refuse, nor refuse to doe with warrant, that which reasonably was practised by those that liued before, and yet are neither some things in all the bookes of Apocripha, nor all things in some of them, by authority permitted publicklye to bee read in our Church, and those which are (as often you haue been told) are not for confirming of faith, but to reform manners. And so (as Saint Austen speaketh) from the customary phrase of the Church wee retayne them and read them as parts of the ould Testamēt.

Saint Hierom (who of al other was most earnest to distinguish these books frō the Canonical,
                     Hiero, in praefat. in Prouerb.
                   yet) sheweth that they were anciently read: Sicut Iudith & Tobiae & Machabaeorum libros legit quidem Ecclesia, sed eos inter Canonicas scripturas non recipit: sic & haec duo volumina (intelligit Sapientiam & Ecclesiasticam) legit ad aedificationē plebis, non ad authoritatem Ecclesiasticorum dogmatum confirmandam. But if Saint (Hierom who was most earnest against these bookes) cannot moue you to approue (as warrantable) their reading in our Church, the consent (peraduenture) and the practise of the Churches reformed may.

From all antiquitie, it then appearing many thinges profitable to edification, to be read in the Church, both in the time of the Iewes before Christ, as also since, which the Church did not esteeme Canonicall, how can it be a silencing of the Scripture in vs, who onely after the example of all antiquitie, read some writings which were called Ecclesiasticall, and more profitable to edification then some Scriptures, although not of equall authoritie for doctrine of faith, as the rest of the Scriptures are, neither was this custome euer thought vntill now of late vnlawfull and idle,
                     Hook. lib. 5. pag. 37. but lawfull, and of much vse, nor as one well noteth,

can it be reasonably thought, because vpon certaine solemne occasions some Lessons are chosen out of those bookes, and of Scripture it selfe, some Chapters not appointed to be read at all, that we therby do offer disgrace to the word of God, or lift vp the writings of men aboue it. For in such choise (considering the intent of the Church) we do not thinke but that fitnes of speech may be more respected then worthines. And therfore although for the peoples more plain instruction (as the ancient vse hath bin) we read in our Churches some Apocripha, besides the Scripture, yet as the scripture we read them not, all men know the differēce that the Church of England maketh in this point. But men shall easily fall into error when they once oppose their priuate iudgement against the Reuerend authority of their owne Church, neither is their conclusion altogether sound, that seeing Moses amongst the Iewes was read euery Sabbath day in their Synagogues, that therefore such Scripture should be onely read, which had the same authority that the writings of Moses had, vnlesse they be able to proue that it was not lawfull for any bookes to be read of them, but the bookes of Moses, which if it were true (as all men know it is not) then eyther there was no Scripture, but the bookes of Moses, or elfe all partes of the Scripture was not read in the Iewish Synagogues. If they vrge vs further with the councell of Laodicea, which forbiddeth any thing to be read, that is not Canonicall, we must tell them that the same councell accounteth that Canonicall which is not. Further, we must craue leaue of those who vrge so strictly the reading of the whole Scripture in Churches, in what part of

the world; or in what tōgue the new testamēt was read in the purest times. Besides, if the authority of Saint Hierome (which you vrge against vs) may be accepted as sufficient in this case against you, he will tel you that some part of the beginning of Genesis,
                     In praefat. in Ezech.
                   the Canticles, the beginning of Ezechiel were not amongst the Iewes permitted to be read of any, vnlesse they were comne to the age of priesthood, which was thirtye, from whence (paraduenture) the gouernors of our Church haue restrayned their voyces frō speaking (by bare reading) to the comon people, who either vnderstand them not at all (being so read) or else peruert them to their owne harme, this is not to sylence them (as you say) but rather to reserue them to a better and safer vse, that those (who for soundnes of Iudgment & knowledge are able) maye reade and expound them at seasons, which are more conuenient. This, if it weare not by lawes strictly commaunded to be obserued of all, but should giue liberty (as you seeme to desire) to some able ministers to doe otherwise, Ignorance (which is euer boldest) would take aduantage continually to be reading the obscurest chapters, whereby the church of necessity could not chuse, but receiue greate harme, & therfore the desires of a few (peraduenture) by reason of their sufficiency not hurtfull, ought to be no motiue why lawes should not be made or executed, which preuent that the worst disposed may not haue libertye to doe harme, or the weakest to receiue. The Chronicles (some part) the Canticles, the Apocalipse, the chapters of some Genealogyes (things wherin ignorant men haue beene euer most forward to deale) contain (in the iudgment of wise men) many things not so requisit for silly

people to know, because they are not bound to giue an account of those things, & their imployment therein, doth not onely distract them, but make them vnable to know such Scriptures as are of more vse, and nearenesse to their owne saluation.Prou. 20.3 I may say as Salomon doth in another case: It is modest humilitie to abstayne from these, but euerie foole will be medling: so that what safely peraduenture might be admitted to able ministers (such as it may be you are) ought not to be a reason, either, why lawes should not be made at all, or why libertie for not vsage should bee granted to those that are able, seeing experience telleth vs, that euerie man will be a Iudge to account himselfe able, and so exemptions (perhaps) reasonable from the strict obseruation of some Canons granted to a few, shall become warrants for the intollerable boldnesse of others, and in the end bring a contempt to all vniformitie in order, from whence must needes follow a ruine and desolution to the gouernment of the whole Church. And surely if men well considered eyther the generall weakenesse of many that take vpon them to expound, or the common ignorance of silly people mixt with a pronnesse to euill, when such Scripture is read, hee must needes thinke the wisedome of our forefathers in this choyce of Scripture to be great, and esteeme the instruction of the people to be the principall end that was propounded by them, this made the Vniuersitie of Cambridge to giue permission onely to such, to interpret Saint Paules Epistles, as were thought in diuinitie fit to be admitted to the degree of Bachelers, because Saint Peter saith, that in them are many

things hard to be vnderstood, which they (that are vnlearned and vnstable) wrest, as they doe all other Scriptures vnto their owne destruction,1. Pet, 3.16. and for the Canticles, which euery man now vndertaketh to expound: Aquinus being requested by the example of Saint Bernard, to write something vpon them, he gaue this answere, giue me the Spirit of Saint Bernard, and I will doe it, yet our Church goeth not so farre to forbid any (that is licenced to preach) to expound these, but only for reading vnto the people, admit in their roome (with out stopping their voyces in due season) other writings euer accounted Ecclesiastical to be read, not as better, but as better seruing for reformation of manners. Yet, howsoeuer, they haue wrongfully accused our Church, in this point, we are glad to see them now so earnest intreaters, for reading the Scriptures in the Church, seeing heretofore, the most of them haue beene content for a Sermon of small edification, but of great length, to omit the reading of many Chapters, which might haue beene done at that time, so that, in true vnderstanding, the silencing of the Scripture, was rather to be feared at their hands, who desired to haue it indifferent, and left free for to read it at all.

Finally, in the 13 of Daniell (as it is vnfitly called) is a repugnancy to the true story of Daniels age, and beginnings of honour.

So in the 7. of Tobit, 3. the Angell maketh himselfe of the tribe of Nepthaly, in the 12. one of the seuen Angels, that offer vp the prayers of the Saints to God, in both, a lyar. And in the latter, a lying vsurper vpon that office, which none but the Angell of the couenant may meddle with. Now knowing that God hath no need of lyes, I dare not read (as a part of diuine seruice) these tales, in his presence, and the presence of his Angels and people, much lesse allow the appointing of them to be read, especially, obseruing how idlely wee shall tell the common people of their basenesse, while yet we read them out of the Bible.
            
            
               ANSVVER.
               WE are glad to heare you confesse that the intention of our Church was, and is pure (and I hope euer shall be touching the dignitie of the Canon) which in my opinion ought to haue been a strong motiue both to you and others, neyther to haue dissented from the practise of the Church in reading things,
                     Whitak Pag. 37. de scriptur.
                   ancient, profitable, and such as were called by the fathers, Scripture, though not Canonicall, nor to haue quarrelled with these bookes, as if all that were in them, were thought by vs to be of an infallible & vndoubted truth: we say thē, first, cōcerning all these bookes, that neither doe wee, nor any in our Church retaine them, as Canonical truthes for doctrine, nor of equall authoritie with the other Scriptures, & yet peraduenture we may giue some reasons, why these things misliked by you, are not of that moment, that thereby

they ought to be accoūted of no better authority thē 
                  Hollinsheads or Eusebius Cronicles.Dani. 13. We confes that we read (by apointmēt) the Historie of Susanna to the last verse, but the last verse (which is the greatest exceptiō to the History) we read not: and the Church of Rome confesseth,
                     Sextus Synens. Bibli. lib. 8. Her. 5. pag. 643. that it ought to belong to the beginning of the foureteenth Chapter. It is knowne that Africanus wrot to Saint Origen cōcerning the truth of this book: but what hee wrote, wee haue yet no warrant, neither can Origen or S. Hierom be iustly proued to bee aduersaries to our opinion in this case, for hee that is most earnest against them (which was Saint Hierom) affirmeth as Doctor Whitakers collecteth, that this storie of Susanna,
                  
                     Vulgata & lect. passim suisse. Whitak. de Scrip. pag. 38. of Bell, and the Dragon, the Hymne of the three children was commonly read in the Church of God, which is al, for which we desire your allowāce as a thing not new or lately inuented, but auncient, warrātable, & so practised by our Church. I could willingly enter into a defence of the trueth of this History, if our aduersaries of the Church of Rome were not ouerapt to make this conclusion (which is not sound) that whatsoeuer was aunciently read in the Church, and is true, ought to bee esteemed as the Canonicall Scripture; so that, they frō truth cōcluding scripture, we are forced against them, to accuse them of some faults: Whereas, if confessing them to bee no canonicall Scriptures, they or others would haue giuen vs leaue to read thē in the Church, as profitable to manners, wee could (without violence) haue afforded them the reconcilement of other Scriptures, and (vndoubtedly) haue proued them to be most true. But howsoeuer, the Church of England requireth not the Subscription

of you, or of any other to warrāt the falshood, and vntruth of any Iewish fable, but to approoue the forme of our Liturgy, so farre, that those books, which anciently were read in the Church, or at least, those parts which containe nothing contrary to faith, may still retaine their auncient place in the Church, for edifying of manners, which was giuen them in the first and the purest times. In which (doubtlesse) the liberty of exchange, formerly left to the discretion of the minister, might haue continued stil, if men would haue tempered themselues from indiscret & causelesse neglect of publicke order: for, as Saint Austin well noteth, That surely he hateth his country, who thinketh himself neuer well, except he trauell. So, little obedience or loue appeareth in those men, who account it their greatest perfection, to oppugne the Church. Now, if Luther thought Iudith and Tobith to be playes at first, and after made Stories, we must tell you, that wee are glad to heare you ascribe so much, to the thought of Luther, but sory to see you ascribe so little to the iudgement of our whole Church; and yet, it is no reason to esteeme them of lesse valew, except wee wil follow the steps of the Anabaptists, and reiect likewise the booke of Iob, seeing the Rabbins in their Talūd, haue taught them to account it as a Tragicall Comedy, and no true storie. Concerning the exception of Daniels age: answer first Bellermin and others, who hold that there were two Daniels, and then you may thinke your obiections stronger then as yet they are. It little concerneth vs to proue the Apocripha to bee true, who euer haue confessed that they are not Canonicall scripture, and therfore may be false: but howsoeuer they are, I must tell you in humility & loue, it was a bold & an vnreuerēd

cōparison to make thē no better then Holinsheads, or Eusebius Chronicles, seeing their greatest enemies haue willingly cōfessed thus much:

Hierom writ so scornfully of the history of Susanna, & the song of the three children, he chargeth him therin to haue robbed depositū sācti Spiritus, & instrumētū diuinū, quod Apostoli Ecclesiijs tradiderūt. & S. Hierom (who is not vsually slow to defend himself) leaueth that point vnanswered, pretending, that what he had spoken, was not as his own opiniō, but what the Iews obiected. And for his pains in trāslating the book of Iudith,

Num quid igitur simpliciter abiiciendi & dānandi sunt libri isti? and he answereth, that we are not to cast them away, wher we thinke they haue some thing in them, which are not consonant to the Canonical scriptures, but rather so to expound them, as that they may agree with them, therfore concerning the fact of Symeon & Leui, for which (as it seemeth) you are not willing to read the book of Iudith,
                  
                     Iudith. 9.2, because she confesseth that GOD put a sworde into their handes to take vengeance of the straungers, blessing the zeale

which Iacob cursed, and God plagued as a rage, wee must answere as others haue done, that the king of Ashur is called the staffe of the Lords wrath,Gen. 49.6.7.5. and his hand was the rod of the Lords indignation,Es. 10.5.6. the Lord sent him to rob, spoyle, and tread downe his people like mire in the streetes. God, therefore put a sword in his hand, and armed him, and not him onely, but as many also as were stirred vp against any country, or Nation, or peculiar persons, good or badde, when it pleased the Lord, either to chastice his children for amendment and tryall, or to punish the wicked to their destruction. Now then, the Sichamites without all controuersie had grieuously offended, and a heauie iudgement of GOD (for their offences) falleth vpon them; therefore may wee say, that the Lord did arme those instruments, by whome hee did execute his vengeance against them. And Master Caluin confesseth, that Vnius puellae stuprum horribili totius vrbis strage Deus vltus est.
                  Calu. in vers 15 Gen. 34. And Musculus saith, voluit Deus insignem hanc contumeliam, tam graui & insigni vindict a punire, vt euidentissimo exemplo monstraret, non fore impunes omnes eos qui contumeliam, & ignominiam Israeli inferrent, modo corde erga se integro esse perseueraret: therefore against reason and the iudgemēt of learned men in our church, you seeme to deny that God did arme Simeon, by whom he did execute his punishment. Besides, Iudith doth not commend that which Iocob condemneth, or curseth; for, Iacob reproueth there the fact,Gen. 34. ver. 30. Gen. 49. for that they did exceed in anger and cruelty; but Iudith commendeth the zeale which they bare vnto the Lord and his lawe, for the villany that the Sichamites had committed, and yet, as concerning the fact of Simeon and Leui, such as were

not ignorāt of that which Iacob doth vtter in both places, are bold to affirme thus: Non est nosirum, de hoc facto filiorum Iacob ferre sententiam,
                  
                     Musculus in cap. 34. Gen.

                     m Iudicio Dei, qui dubio procul hunc illius zelum, ad sumendum de reprobis vltionem indidit. Of like iudgement were some long since, that liued in the church, of whom Beda saith, alij dicunt hanc vindictam, quae facta est a Simeone, & Leui, domino non displicere, quod in hoc ostenditur, quia liberati sunt de manu inimicorum suorum: Siue quod Legem dei, & circumcisionem vindicauerunt, eo quod vim fecit incircumcisus super illam quae de Circumcisione fuerat. Lyra (writing vpon the ninth of Iudith) saith thus; hoc videtur falsum, nam Iacob reprehendit illud factum tanquam malum. Gen. 34.49.

All which considered, with that which many other Diuines haue written in this cause, you cannot but confesse that Iacob and Iudith (in diuerse respectes) might censure the same fact in a diuers manner,Iacob condemneth the maner, and both truly. and yet both true. The next thing which you mislike; is, that in Toby, where the Angell maketh himselfe of the trybe of Nephthaly, and in another place, one of the seauen holy Angels that offer vp the prayers of the Saints to God;Tob.

Lyra saith, It is a figuratiue speach, like that in Tob. 6. vers. 12. Wher Azarias is interpreted adiutor Dei, & so are the Angels: Ananias is interpreted gloria Dei, whose sons are the Angels.

readeth it as you reproue, but it was a trāslation neuer for the notes or the text, publickly authorised in our Church, so that modesty and due consideration ought to haue examined accusations of this Nature, with greater care, least others rightly iudge, that the assertions of such cannot be sound, that wrongfully, without conscience, dare aduenture to accuse both the church, on earth, and the Angels in heauen.

                   of the Church Bible; by which I made no doubt, but any man might correct the translations in the Communion booke, where they obscured or crossed the sense. But you (my Lord) gaue me in this point another light, telling mee, that we must vse only, and subscribe to the trāslations in the booke which I also vnderstood to be auouched, by some other of your brethren, and lately found out to be intended in the Canon for subscription, wherin it is said, that the booke of Common Prayer, containeth nothing in it contrary to the worde of GOD, and may

lawfully (So) be vsed, so (a word now put in) as containing in it nothing contrarie to the word: and after, that I do ex animo subscribe to all things contained in the three articles. Now my Lord, if Austin (vpon the credit of many Latin copies) would not admit one word (palam), where the sense rather required, then receiued it, because it was not in the Greeke, how shall I approue vnder my hand a translation, which hath many omissions, many additions, which sometime obscureth, sometime peruerteth the sense, being sometime senselesse, sometimes contrarie; of which I pray your Lordship to take a tast in the last page of this booke, where I will muster them together.
            
            
               ANSWER.
               IF you had continued in your former resolution, not to haue feared to subscribe, although some faultes were iustly to be found in the translation vsed, in our Church, you had neither opened a way to your owne wrong, hazarded for your curious disobedience, the Churches censure, nor procured our labour in defending her at this time. It need not to be supposed by any, that the Church of England desireth to impose an allowance of any corrupt translation, neither are you, or any other, as we haue often told you, required to allow by subscription the translation, but onely to approue the forme of diuine seruice; and yet surely the care of this Church, since the light of the Gospell did shine in it, was neuer wanting to publish the scriptures, translated as agreeable to the fountaines, as they could deuise; and to this end, authoritie did commaund the allowance of that translation, which for their

                   that any man might correct the translations in the communion Booke, where they obscured or crossed the sense: we must tell you, that, first for the vulgar translation,

                   euerie priuate man must not take libertie vnto himselfe, to correct and amend at his owne pleasure, least wee haue iust occasion to complaine, as Saint Hierome doth, that there be as many varieties of translations, as there be bookes, whilest euerie man (according to his fancie) addeth or detracteth as seemeth good to himselfe. Neyther can an error in translating, in any Church, be an argument sufficient to proue it to be no Church. And concerning the Church of England, it hath not wanted a care, and a religious care in this point, and therefore it were no reason for you, or any to reproue

her, for that wherein she deserueth prayse, onely your patience is required, to forbeare all priuate corrections of translations, vntil authority from the diligent labors of learned men (wholly imployed in that busines) may establish a better & yet the faults in this, are not such, but they may be tollerated without offence, though (peraduēture) corrected with more benefit. And seeing there is no error in faith, contrarie to the doctrine of the Church, that can be in pretence confirmed, by any reading, which we allow, me thinks the article of subscription may wel say, that the book of common prayer containeth nothing in it contrarie to the word of God, and that it may lawfully be so vsed. But say you, if Austin (whom I call Saint Austin) vpon the credit of many Latin copies, would not admit one word (palam) where the sense rather required, thē receiued it, because it was not in the Greeke, how shal I approue vnder my hand, a translation which hath many omissions, &c. If your moderation had beene like vnto Saint Austins in this case, we should haue little cause to mislike your doing, and yet the example, which you bring for your best warrant, being stretched so far, as you do, cannot iustly be reckond amōgst S. Austins vertues. For in that place which you alledge, he saith: Multa latina exemplaria sic habent (et pater tuus quividet in absconso, reddet tibi palam,) sed quia in Graecis quae priora sunt, non inuenimus (palam) non putauimus huic aliquid disserendum esse. Now, I see not, what can be directly gathered from S. Austins example, for (palā
                  ) was not in some Greek copies, but I hope you know what 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   is, which sometimes they trāslate in propatulo, somtimes palam, & if the old Latin translation want it, & the Greek haue it (as

                  FRom the exceptions concerning the Scriptures, I come to those which arise about the Sacramēts. And though there because to speake of priuat Communions, as on the Churches part, not so well ordained; yet I will insist vpon priuate Baptisme, and will draw vnto it that Rubrick, which saith (that it is certaine by Gods word, that Infantes baptised haue all things needfull to saluation, and are vndoubtedly saued. This speech I did interpret as spokē not simply, but ex hypothesi in opposition to the popish conceit of the necessity of confirmation in this maner, that the child (hath al things necessary) that is, all outward means, & needs no confirmation (& is vndoubtedly saued) that is as vndoubtedly, as if it were confirmed. And vnto this construction the precedent part of the Rubrick directed me, & the sound doctrine of our Church against the simple necessity of Baptisme, and grace inseperably annexed therto, did set me in it, & then the speech seemed like that of Christ in the ninth of Iohn, where hee saith, (neither hath this man sinned nor his father) that is not in such sense as the question was asked, whether he or his father

had sinned. As for priuate Baptisme by a lawfull minister, being acccompanied with such doctrine, as our Church hitherto hath generally receiued about the same. I thought, it might be inexpe

Sacramēts (by reason of their mixt nature) are more diuersly interpreted, & disputed of, thē any other part of religiō besides, for that in so great store of properties, belōging to the self same thing, as euery mans wit hath takē hold of some especial consideratiō, aboue the rest▪ so they haue accordingly giuē their censure of the vse & necessity of thē, for if respect be had to the duty which euery cōmunicant doth vndertake, we may cal thē truly bonds of our obedience to God, strict obligations to the mutual exercise of christiā 
                  charity, prouocatiōs to godlines, preseruations from Sin, memorials of the principall benefits of Christ. If we respect the time of their institution, they are annexed for euer vnto the new Testament, as other rites were before to the old: If we regard the weaknes that is in vs, they are warrāts for the more security of our beleefe: If we compare the receiuers with those that receiue thē not, they are works of destinction to separate Gods own from strangers: & in those, that receiue thē as they ought, they are tokens of Gods gracious presence, wherby men are taught to know what they cannot see: for Christ & his holy spirit with all their blessed effectes (though entring into the soule of man, we are not able to apprehend or expresse how) do notwithstanding giue notice of the times, when they vse to make their accesse, because it pleaseth Almighty God to cōmunicate (by sēsible means) those blessings which are incōprehensible; seeing therfore that grace is a cō
                  sequent of Sacramēts; a thing which accōpanieth thē as their end: a benefit, which he that hath, receiueth from God himself, the author of Sacramēts, & not frō any other naturall or supernaturall quality in them. It

may be hardly both vnderstood, that Sacraments are necessary, and that the manner of their necessitie to life supernaturall, is not in all respects, as meat, drink, and such like, vnto naturall life: because they containe in themselues no vitall force or efficacy, but they are duties of seruice and worship which vnlesse we performe, as the author of grace requireth, they are vnprofitable: For all receiue not the grace of God, which receiue the Sacraments of his grace, neither is it (ordinarily) his wil, to bestow the grace of sacraments vpon any, but by the Sacraments: which grace also, they that receiue by Sacraments,

GOD. And for others, who want this Sacrament, although wee cannot Iudge of the secret election of God, yet we haue reason to feare a denyall of that Grace,
                     Hook. li. 5. where we see a manifestation of the want of the meanes, appointed for the obtaining of it: for (doubtlesse) as one noteth, the sacrament of Baptisme in respect of God, the author of the institution, may admit dispensation, but in regard of vs, who are tyed to obey, there is an absolute necessitie: for it is in the power of God, without these to saue, but it is not in the power of man, without these to come to saluation. And yet our Church holdeth constantly, and truely (notwithstanding your doubts) as well touching other beleeuers, as Martyrs, that Baptisme taken away by ne

What could be more religious & agreeable to the doctrin of truth, or more necessary in these presūptuous times, wherin a Sacrament of so absolute necessity (by practise of some) is growen into such contempt: which necessity, if at any time wee haue denyed (dealing with those of the church of Rome), It is because ouerstrictly they bind (frō the act done) grace to the Sacraments, as if none that receiue them, could want it, or none receiue that grace that do want them.

               MY secōd exceptiō, about the Sacramēts, is to the interrogatories in Baptisme, made to the child, & answered by the suretyes, that this fashion was causlesly & needlesly trāsferred frō those of years, & forerūners to Infāts free born in the church, I hold with Beza, Bullinger, Zepper, & others; yet thought it not vnlawful in this cōstruction; namely, that this professiō (made in the childs name) shold not import, either such a distinct faith in the child, which (saith Austin) were Insanus error: or that the faith of the sureties should auaile the Infāt, which the word reiecteth: or, that the sureties vndertook that the childe shal hereafter make good this profession, which were Insana presūptio: but that this profession was thus made by the mouthes of the Godfathers, partly to admonish the vnderstāding congregation of that couenāt, which Baptisme really inioyneth to euery Christian, euen as the Prophet spake to the dead Altar, to admonish liuing Ieroboam, & the Prophets (as Chrisostom notes) spake to the vnreasonable creatures,

                   to teach reasonable men, how vnreasonable they were become: and secondly, to cast vpon the Godfathers, a kind of charge, & with it, an aduantage of calling vpon this childe, when he came to yeares to knowe & answere that stipulation of Baptisme, which they made profession of, as in his name, whē he was Baptized, to shew what he should haue done himselfe, if he had bin of years: & in this sense, I thinke it lawfull though (perhaps) too obscure and vnnecessarie. But my Lord, if the Catechisme, which making Faith and Repentance (that is, the profession of Faith and Repentance) necessary to those that are to be baptyzed, proceeds to say, that Infants perform this faith, and repentance by their sureties. If (I say) this intend (as it doth insinuate) a necessitie of such a profession to

be made in the childes name, before it might bee admitted to the Sacrament, as I reiect that conceipt as an error fauoring this Anabaptisticall opinion, that faith must fore-goe the Sacrament of Baptisme: so, I dare not subscribe to the practise so inioyned, and intended, and would wish it changed into that course,Cons

               ANSVVER.
               IT seemeth, there is a curious desire of reprehension in those men, who are willing to reproue the practise of their owne Church, for that which is a custome ancient, necessarie, and of much vse: wherein wee reprehend not alone the disposition of such, but wee are ready to let the world see, that the things themselues are most innocent, which they doe reproue. Most of them are not yet come so farre, as to deny Baptisme to Infants (an arrour which may follow from their former opinions, if they suffer Scisme to growe in them, and humours to bee rules for conscience but they are ready to professe, that there is no saith in the childe required to Baptisme, and that to bee borne of faithfull Parents, is as much for their admission into the Church, as the profession of the faith, which they make by the mouthes of others. This, as it is vnthankfull to spurne at the indulgence of the Church; so, it is a contempt of duety, which God requireth on our part: there is no attainment to life, but through the onely begotten sonne of God, nor by him otherwise, then being such for beleefe as wee ought: as if those Articles in the iudgement of God, were set downe for all men: first, to subscribe vnto whom, by Baptisme,

the church receiueth into Christs schoole; and seeing no religion inioyeth sacraments, the signes of Gods loue, vnlesse it haue also that faith whereupon sacramēts are built, could there (as one well noteth) (which I am sory you obserued not before you stumbled at these doubts) be any thing more conuenient,Hooker lib. 5. Page 152. then that our first admittance to the actuall receipt of his grace in the sacrament of Baptisme, should be consecrated with profession of beleefe, which is to the kingdome of God as a key, the want whereof excludeth Infidels both from that, and from all other sauing grace; And howsoeuer we say with S. Austin that Infants haue not a present Actuall habit of faith yet they haue then the foundation of that wherupon afterward they build, the first ground whereof was laid by the sacrament of Baptisme; so that without any madd presumption (as you tearme it) we may say truly of infants, that they are then beleeuers, because in Baptisme they begin to be, which continuance of time doth afterwarde make perfect. For if we call them beleeuers for their outward profession sake who are much further from faith then infants, why may we not without madnes or presumption, account infants to haue faith which haue that grace giuen them,Quem potuerunt illi nosse nec habere, isti potuerunt habere antequam nosse▪ 
                     Aust.
                   which is the first and most effectual cause, out of which our beleeue groweth: and whilest others that know him beleeue not in him, these beleue in him before they know him. Now seeing then that Baptisme implyeth as Circumcision a couenant betwixt God and his people, it is to be thought that as God in that sacrament bestoweth remission of sins & the holy Ghost, binding himself as it were to bestow all other graces requisite in time to come; so euery infant receiuing the same sacrament at the hands of god

tyeth himselfe likewise for euer, to doe and beleeue what the Lord commaundeth. Now, who is there (considering this contract) that can blame either the interrogatories, or the suretyes which vndertake in this stipulation, seeing the thing is required, nay, inioyned with such necessity for the Church, to exclude infants, because they cannot by their owne tongues contract, were ouer rigorous: and not to take securitie at all, for those who cannot answere for themselues were to bee to carelesse; for the profession of faith, beeing necessarie to a publike admittance into the house of God, what cause is there why suretyes may not lawfully doe it, seeing they know they are the children of fathfull Parents, and so consequently partakers of the promise, and that they are such as would make the same profession themselues, if they were of yeares, or that the Church should not require it, euen to put men in minde vpon what condition they admit them into the Church, and to manifest a reason, why they refuse others: so that for any thing I see alledged against it, as faith and repentance are necessarie to make the Sacraments effectuall, so this faith in this case is lawfully professed by the sureties, and effectuall for the infant, whome to accept into the Church without this, were to wrong the Sacrament, and not to receiue with this, were to wrong those infants, to whom the couenant belongeth by an euerlasting promise.Gen. 1

                     Of the Crosse in Baptisme. SECT. 9.
                  THE last thing about Baptisme, is the signe of the Crosse which though I long held otherwise, yet of later yeares I held lawfull to bee vsed, taken in this construction that after the childe was incorporate into Christ and his Church

by Baptisme; the congregation, by the mouth of the minister, as their Agent in this and not Gods, as in Baptisme, should acknowledge their acceptance of him into their societie▪ and signe him with the signe of the crosse, as with an auncient token of christian profession, in token of that which the congregation hereafter expected and hoped for at the hands of this childe newly made one of their fraternitie by Baptisme. In which vse, I held it no sygne from God to men, as bee the Sacraments: nor of men to God, as the bowing of the knee in prayer, but of men to men, as the Kisse of Loue, or the Ring in Mariage; no part of Gods worshippe, no part of the Sacrament, no consecrating or operatiue signe, no Symbolicall or Sacramentall sygne, no not so much as explicatorie to set out the vertue of the Sacrament, as oyle, milke, hony, and other olde deuised, but wel reiected cerimonies did; but to bee a simple significatiue ryte, to expresse the congregations hope, and expectance of this childe. And in this haue defended it, not as well imposed, but as lawfull to be vsed, at sundry meetings before and since my Subscription; and to perswade mee that our church intended it in this sense, I haue these reasons. First, because it followeth after the verie act of Baptisme finished. Secondly, because the words are in the plurall number (wee receiue this childe &c. Thirdly, in priuate Baptisme, where the company expecting present death, could not hope for such a christian profession to be, after made, that Sygne was omitted, which if it had intended any consecration or operatiue vertue, might and would then haue beene vsed; and lastly because the Godly fathers which reformed the book cast it out of the sacrament of the Supper, and all other vses where it assumed any superstitious purposes, I beleeue they ment here to reduce it to the very first vse and only good vse which it had to make it a simple token of christian profession, and no more.

               It litle auaileth in the consideration of wise men, either to publish our owne former true opinions which afterward we indeuour to disproue, or to afford iust excuses for the lawfull practise of that church, with which notwithstanding we are not willing to consent; It being either decept in vs to allowe what in conscience we think not to be good, or an vnexcusable weaknes not to consent vnto that which we doe allow; In this respect of the practise of sundry men (who are willing to seeme and peraduenture in truth are vertuous) the church of England may iustly complaine as Saint Hierom doth ab,

                   then to learne wholesome things. Morall wise men haue thought wauering to be the greatest signe of an euill minde. For wisedome cannot better appeare, then euer to will and to nill the same things; this being as one noteth the foundation of that truth, that the same thing cannot euer please,

this nature, to relye vpon their fancies at all, whose opinions in things for which they contend with so much earnestnes, are continually subiect to so much change; reason euer by collection concluding thus, that whasoeuer hath bene may be, and those who haue thrise changed are not at all times when they seeme so guided by the truth which is euer the same, but rather may feare the imputation of a double minde,
                  
                     Iames 1.8. which as S. Iames faith, is vnstable in all his wayes. Yet notwithstanding, wee are willing and desirous to heare from you such speaches, as are arguments of that loue and obedience which all men ought to beare vnto that Church wherein they liue: we are content to allowe (although you haue not fully expressed the intention of the Church of England in this point) That to signe the Infant with the signe of the Crosse, was to signe him with an ancient token of Christian profession: that it is not a signe from God to men, nor of men to God, (and therefore no idolatrous worship invented in our Church) but of men to men (as the Ring in marriage) no part of the Sacrament, no consecrating or operatiue signe, no Symbolicall or sacramentall signe not so much as explicatory but a simple significatiue rite expres to the Cōgregations hope & expectation of that child; which no mā can doubt to be the vertuous & religious intention of our Church: both because (as you confes) It is after Baptisme, 2. It is saide, wee. 3. It is omitted in priuate Baptisme. 4. And lastly the signe is omitted in the Lords Supper, as not giuing either vertue to the Sacrament or holinesse to the action, which were (in these latter times) vnsufferable errors, superstitiously brought in by the Church of Rome: wherein all indifferent men may see the moderation of our church, which hauing left the ordinary vse of the Crosse, in al

actions at all times, (for which the practise of antiquitie might haue beene some warrant) haue onely admitted the same in Baptisme, as then chiefly requisite for a signification of that profession, which at that time the Infant vndertooke, and therein ment to continue for euer after. In this sence (which is the warrantable intention of our Church) if you haue held it lawfull heretofore, and now doe not, wee may say as S. Paule to the Galathians;Gal. 5.7 
                  Ye did run well, who hath hindred you, that you did not obey the trueth? but wee will not censure you, but rather hope better things of you, desiring all men to remember the Apostles peremptorie conclusion; If any man teach otherwise & consenteth not to the wholsom words of the Lord Iesus Christ, & to the Doctrine which is according to godlinesse,

                   as to the iudgement of the church (though for my reuerend opinion of that assemhly I could easily beleeue that in this explication they haue bin vsed as were the good fathers at the counsel of Arimine, vnder great penalties;) I finde that our Church professeth to retaine it for the very remembrance of the Crosse, which is precious to all that truely beleeue in Christ, and in such vse as did the antique fathers and churches, and by name, that by that cerimony and honorable badge the infant is dedicated to the seruice

of him that dyed vpon the crosse; In which construction I do not see how I can subscribe vnto it, as before I did; for confessing that I grudged the name of an honorable badge, remembring to what dishonorable Idolatry, it serued of late and yet doth in Popery, and being therupon attainted by the Peares and neighbour Churches is not yet restored in blood, and think we may say of it, as Iacob of Reuben; Thou wast fair, but hast lost thy bewty by clyming vp vnto thy fathers bed. I protest against that memoratiue vse of it in the congregation and in the Sacrament, to call to minde the Crosse of Christ (whether thereby his sufferings, or his Altar be ment) as that which openeth a gappe to crossings in daily vse, and crosses and crucifixes, and so any Imagery in the church and worship of God; and think that this which hath bin abused with spirituall fornication, as a common harlot, may easily proue in that vse a cunning baud to solicite the vnstable hearts of men to their old superstition, and therefore seemeth to me to be against the second commaundement, which forbiddeth all prouocations vnto Superstition, as well as the seauenth doth all incitations to Adultery.

From hence proceedeth a reuerend vse and estimation of the signe of the crosse, in the Apostles time, signing hereby not onely themselues when they met with the Iewes, but their children which were baptised, to dedicate them by badge, as it were to his seruice, whose benefits bestowed vpon them, were contained vnder that name, and procured vnto man by Christs death vpon the crosse. But time corrupting often with staines of superstition the best things (for if Christ tell Peter, If I wash thee not,
                  Ioh, 13, 8, 9. 
                  thou shalt haue no part with mee; Peter will answere, Lord not my feete only, but my hands and my head) so apt are we to ouerdoe that which wee finde to bee profitable

vnto vs) The signe of the crosse in the more ignorant times of the church that followed after, became so loaden with a continuall and necessarie obseruation, full of superstitious Idolatry, as if it had beene for all occasions, a compleate armour to euery Christian, and that nothing could bee well, either begun, continued, or ended, that was not first hallowed with this signe. From which ignorant opinion, blemishing a thing of vertuous and good vse, the Church of England desiring to free the signe of the Crosse, doth not commaund or allow the publick vse at any other time but in Baptisme, and that first, as no part of the substance of that Sacrament, adding any thing to the vertue or perfection of Baptisme. Secondly, nor as a meanes of admitting of any into Christs flock, but as a lawfull outward ceremony, and honorable badge, whereby the Infant is dedicated to the seruice of him that dyed vpon the crosse. In respect whereof, the very name hath and shall bee honorable amongst all true christians to the worlds end: and therefore your comparison, of those in the conuocation for making of this Canon, to them in the councell of ARMINE might haue beene well spared, seeing the perticulers of both beeing duely waighed, wise men may easily perceiue the beginnings, the proceedings, and the conclusion to bee farre vnlike: and therfore I must tel you, though not with so much seuerity as the cause deserueth, you could not with all your studie, haue found out a comparison more vnbefitting this cause, & more presumptuously iniurious to the King and the whole Church; which, that the reader may better vnderstand, wee will briefly set downe as others haue done, from the begining to the, end the proceeding of that councell.

Now, what can there be in the late graue and reuerend conuocation of the clergie of England answerable to this councell? First, for any thing that I know there was amongst them no faction▪ Secondly, they dealt not deceitfully with the king to obtaine an allowance of what they concluded. Thirdly, no mn was vrged

by compulsion, or detained vpon penalties to giue his consent; onely in this one thing, peraduenture not vnlike, that the councell of Nyce had on her side foure hundred, whereas the Arrians (these inuentors of new opinions) had not foure score: besides I doubt not, but what was practised with the Emperour in this councel, the contrarie was done with the King at the conuocation, and so consequently you haue little reason to thinke that they were vsed as the good fathers at the councell of Armine, for all men see that such as the Catholicks made choyce of as Embassadors for their part, to the Emperour at that time, such the Scismaticks selected as solicitours of their cause, and followers of those petitiōs which were deliuered vp: some in whome nothing was to be noted, but boldnesse, neither grauitie, nor learning nor wisdome. Which if you confesse, and thereby would conclude your selues to haue the trueth, but to haue also the same euill choyce of Agents, as the catholickes at that time; we say this were to wrap his sacred Maiestie in the ouersight of Constantine, and for excusing of your selues, to lay an iniurious imputation vpon one of the grauest, the most religious, the most learned and vertuous conuocations that euer were assēbled in this church: wrong not your pretended sincerity & zeale ouer much in your vncharitable & vncomly cēsuring of that meeting frō which wee doubt not but holinesse and piety shall receiue strength and comfort,

               WHere men are willing to dissent from the ancient lawfull practise of their owne church, either because they are desirous to bee like others, or because they cannot long indure to be like themselues, It is strange with what care they are subtilly cunning, to 
                     •
                  inde out probable excuses wherby they may seeme to the common capacitie of man, for to erre with reason. If when wee admit into the church the Infant by Baptisme, wee than also signe him with the crosse, in token of that warfare which hee promiseth to vndertake: shall wee therefore conceiue that either the Sacrament is impeacht of insufficiencie in that point, or that this addition is idle and superfluous? It is ouer much confidence and rigour to conclude thus; wee derogate nothing from the sacrament of Baptisme, when wee call the crosse a token of our warfare for Christ. For there may bee many signes of one and the same thing, though notal alike excellēt. Baptisme is a Sacrament ordained of God, and a seale of his promise, teaching vs also that we are Christs soldiers & must fight vnder him, choosing a ceremony ordain'd by the church in the purest times, in signe and token also of the same warfare, and as it was not superfluous in the Lawe to declare one thing by many signes, as namely, mans vncleannesse by circumcision, purifying &c. So it must not bee accounted needlesse vnder the Gospell to

make that plaine by words or signes, that at the first cannot so easily be vnderstood. Saint Austin saith that the whole action of our Redemption, is signified vnto vs by the day of the natiuity of Christ yearely celebrated, and also by the Sacrament of the supper, but after a diuerse sort:Aust. Epist. 190. ad lanuarium. for the day of the Natiuitie is onely a memoriall thereof, the other a Sacrament. The same may be said of crossing in Baptisme, and of baptisme it selfe; the one is a more externall & accidentall signe the other a substantiall Sacrament,Act 15.28, 1. Cor. 14, 26. Gal. 4, 9 neither is this signe in the numbe

                   of those vnnecessary things which are a burden, or not to edifying, or one of those beggerly rudiments which bring vs into bondage againe; or one of those which Popery drained from antiquity and all reformed churches haue cast out: but a signe for vse of great antiquitie in the Sacrament of baptisme: now things that are significant are not all equally significant, for a sacrament saith Saint Austine, is when there is such a remembrance of the thing done, that there is also something signyfied which is holily to be receiued,Sacramentum est autem cum reigestae ita rememoratio fit, vt aliqnid etiam significari intelligatur. Aug. so that howsoeuer many ceremonies are retained in the church significant for those ends, furtherances of piety whereunto they serue, yet we neither do, nor dare account them significant as the sacraments, which represent christ, and are rather to be receiued then done, the other rather to be done then to be receiued by vs. If this signe then of the crosse haue not beene drained from Popery, as you imagine, but of ancient and publike vse in Tertullians time, who liued within lesse than a hundred yeares after Saint Iohn; If Bucer in his censure of our Lyturgy, P. Martyre, Hemingius, Beza, and diuerse others of the reformed Churches (as shall appeare hereafter) account

it to bee lawfull as it is vsed and retained in this Church; we cannot but tel you and the whole world, that the curiositie of some few, is no iust preiudice to antiquitie: nor these sleight occasions either warrant to your conscience for disobedience, or in the opinion of wise men, any great imputation to our Church.

               THere is no plea we so willingly heare, as that which striueth for the sincerity of Gods worship, for that being mans duety and happinesse, yet because easily corrupted, least of all permitted to mans liberty (God hauing prescribed an exact forme how hee will be honored) wee ought all of vs, both to search out and to further those holy obseruations, which are free from superstition, & do serue vnto this end. To dedicate the infant by this signe to Christ, is to make this signe say you a meanes whereby Christ is worshipped, and so will-worshippe is raised repugnant to the word of GOD, a thing surely not fit either to bee commanded or performed by any that are vertuous in our Church.
               It seemeth that in this more then ordinary curiosity of zeale, you haue neither rightly waighed what it is to dedicate in that sense which the Church taketh it, nor how many, and of what nature are the parts of externall diuine worship. For euery action referred to God (of which kinde pearaduenture this is not) to set out any part of our deuotion and duety to him, is not of necessity worship; for as in Baptisme wee are incorporat into the death of christ, which was ignominious vpon the crosse: so by this signe we doe externally testifie to the world, that we haue cōmended our selues (for it doth not please you to say dedicated) vnto his seruice, of whose death, merit, and profession we are not, nor euer purpose to bee ashamed; all which wee testifie by signing this signe in the seat of shame, without any proportion or resemblance with diuine worship. Only we acknowledge (as D. Whitakers noteth) that this is an anciēt ceremony from the first beginning almost of Religion,Whit. contra. Quest. 6 and the christian church; the reason wherof,

as hee noteth was this; Vt Christiani qui tum inter Ethnicos viuebant qui a fide alienissimi essent, sese omni ratione Christianos esse declararent, atque testarentur publice, That christians, who then liued amongst the Heathen, and such as were aliens from the faith, might publickly restifie and declare themselues that they were christians.
               For with this signe (by reason of the contempt of the crosse which all others had) the christians were accustomed to marke and signe themselues, as with the ensigne of their owne profession; which being the custome of those times (as Doctor Whitakers noteth) and no more then is performed at this day, wee cannot but wonder at the cauelling of such as make it any part of Diuine worshippe, and at the peeuishnesse of those who from hence would conclude a will-worship inuented from humane reason.
               All men may knowe that there was vnto the Iewes, and so is and shall bee in all Churches vntill the end of the world, besides the Sacraments in the externall worshippe sacrifices, oblations, and such like, which are not the inuentions of men, but traditions of the church which (in matters of this nature) hath authority to appoint daies, places, and things furtherances and parts, though not of the immediate, yet in a large phrase, of the externall worshippe of God▪ of which external worship, some parts belong to obedience, doing and fulfilling the morall precepts, some other to the obseruation of outward ceremonies, and yet euen these are not all of one nature, nor of equall nearnes to the principall parts of the outward worshippe: for the ceremoniall worshippe, which hath and shall bee in the

Church in all ages, consisting in things and actions, is thus distinguished: into those wherein the worshippe consisteth, & into those which are annexed to it. These amongst the Iewes were Temples, Altars, Persons, Garments, Vessels, Times and such like, but with vs (as one noteth) they are for number fewer,Zanch, in Deca. pag. 41

For example, Christ celebrated the Supper at e

                  ening, the Apostles and the Church after thē, in the morning; shall wee say therefore any thing is added or detracted in this Sacrament? no because Christ did not command that this should be celebrated in the euening as he did, but only that we should do that which hee did, not at that time wherein hee did it, so that the auncient Church (as wee may reade in Iustin Martyr) mingling and delaying the wine with water▪ did not therefore or thereby change the institution of the Supper, whereof there may be a twofolde reason; one that the wine which Christ gaue to his disciples, might be so allaid for any thing wee knowe, seeing the Apostles haue set nothing downe to the contrarie, and therefore probable that the ancient Church receiued it from them. Secondly, because the ancient

Church did not adde 
                     •
                  his in the Sacrament, as an essē
                  tiall necessary thing pertaining to the substance of the Supper,Blood and water out of the side of Christ. but as accidentall to signifie a mysterie; the like may bee saide of many things in Baptisme, where either by adding or detracting to alter things otherwise not essentiall in Baptisme, and therein stil following the lawes and ceremonies of that Church wherein wee liue, is not to change either the sacrament of Christ, or to prophane it by addition of any wil-worship; to ordaine then new diuine worshippe, is to adde vnto his word: which thing is not lawfull, seeing the word is necessarie, bindeth the conscience, deliuereth the substance of diuine worshippe, and hath nothing in it expressed indifferent. Now to adde hereunto is to ordaine somewhat, as a thing absolutely necessary, & pertaining to the essence of worshippe, and which so bindeth the conscience as the word it selfe, and therefore they adde not to the word, which by the consent of the Church, do ordaine any ceremony in the externall worship (obseruing the limitations of order, comlinesse, and edification) not as necessary, but as a thing indifferent and free, binding the conscience not out of the qualitie of the thing, but onely from hence, that it is commaunded: for as there are (as the schoolemen say) somethings which are mala quia prohibita, somethings which are prohibita quia mala, so there are some things mandata quia necessaria, some things necessaria quia mandata, of which kinde in Baptisme we account the crosse.
               But as wee neither allowe vnmeete, nor purpose the stiffe defence of any vnnecessarie custome heretofore vsed in Baptisme, so wee knowe not yet any reason why infants should be the worse, if at their first admission

into the Church of Christ, if at the time when they are deliuered as it were vnto Gods owne possession (for the Church and euery member thereof, as Master Zanchy noteth, ought first of all to offer it selfe to God) ceremonies fit to betoken such intents be vsuall with vs, as in the purest times they haue beene. Hereby putting the whole congregation in mind that the Infant thus admitted into the church, hath by the promise of his

This being then our innouation, and the beginning of that profession wherein wee purpose to continew to our liues end, to haue either besides the thing, which is Baptisme, a significant signe which is the crosse, or to call it a dedication (seeing the Greeke word

Martyr noteth) are then visibly consecrated vnto God when they be washed in holy Baptisme,

affaires of God, as in some greater things what is true.
               The Hebrewes did dedicate and initiate their things not by simple and bare words, but by adding of outward rites, signes I meane, and tokens which might bee seene, not that they taught any holinesse or diuine quality to bee in those things (for seeing it is in the soule, these are not capable of it) but so they thought because the rites beeing instituted by GOD (whose authoritie in this case the Church now hath) those things which were consecrated, might become instruments of the holy spirit,Loc. Com. lib▪ 4 19. lib. 4. cap by which the faith of men might bee stirred vp; this is the opinion of P. Martyr. Seeing then our dedication, as shall appeare afterward, is not as you imagine, wee conclude, that it is neither vnlawful for the church to adde ceremonies, significant in this kinde, as accidentall parts of the externall worshippe, nor (though wee yet graunt you not so much vnlawfull amongst those for to account the crosse, beeing neither by our church esteemed as a meanes) of diuine worshippe, nor imposed for Doctrine, being but the tradition of men.

                   by confessing our Dedication by this signe to be such, as the ancient fathers before Popery did vse.
               Now it is plaine, that sauing the verie point of adoration and worship, with which popery crowned this Idoll, there is nothing ascribed to the crosse, in or out of Baptisme, by the ranckest Papists, but the fathers are as deeply ingaged in the same. So, if we vse it as the fathers, wee hold it to be so necessary for our defence, as was the bloud of the passouer vpon the Israelites posts, or as the marke on their foreheads in the ninth of Ezechiell without which none can be safe. For so did the fathers, and we take the soule to be fenced by the crossing of the body, and the crosse to haue vertue of consecrating the sacramēt or the childe: of driuing away diuels witchcraft and diseases, of strengthing against temptations. And if we will excuse the fathers by saying they spake thus relatiuè, with reference to the crosse of Christ and his death, neither will all their speaches heare this releefe, nor haue we at all distanced them from the Papists, who say as much for themselues: and then what Popish superstition is that, from which we haue purged it? Specially if his maiestie were truely informed at the conference, that in Ba

                  tisme the Papists neuer ascribe any power or spirituall grace therto (as indeed he was not) witnesse their writers, and how either skilfully or negligently haue we vnder the faier name of the Primitiue and Apostolicall Churches, reduced it to that vse of holinesse and consecration, which in the name of the Papists could not haue beene borne: I confesse my Lord, I had rather thinke some committies to whom the penning of this Canon was betrusted to haue failed therin then misdeeme all that reuerend assembly to haue intended such a meaning. But so long as this interpretation stands as the mi
                     •
                  de of our Church I shall

feare it iustly, knowing how vnder the couert of phrases, the maine points of trueth haue beene surprised, and therefore may be againe. So I conclude, that as the Israelites bore that alter for a signe, which for Sacrificing they could not haue suffered, so for a simple significatiue signe, I could haue borne that of the crosse, which for an altar of dedication I cannot approoue.
            
            
               ANSERE.
               WHILST some men, in the sincerity of an vpright minde, haue laboured with humility to giue satisfaction to contentious spirits, both those persons runne more speedily from vs, whom wee desire to ouertake, and also a common enemie surpriseth vs with aduantage, making vs to seeme in the eye of the world to bee of their minde, because with greater moderation we abstain from that vehemēt zeale to reformation, that others more rashly are trāsported with; so that in this case, the labour is neither easie nor safe. For to answere our brethren at home with that trueth and freedom, which both the cause and our loue to their persons doth chalenge from vs, is but to open the mouth of the common aduersarie, as if wee spake and thought as they doe, and out of this feare, to suppresse our answere, were with much weakenesse to betray the trueth.
               This consideration, as it is not of small importance in the whole cause, so especially in this point concerning the crosse, where the diffence of a lawful ceremony, may easily bee thought the erecting of that Idoll, whereunto the most superstitious in those later times haue beene corruptly perswaded to giue honor.
               
                  For mine owne pa
                     •
                  t in satisfaction to the Church of Christ (whereunto I owe the vttermost of that simple talent which GOD hath giuen mee) I Protest, that neither out of malice I oppugne our brethren at home, nor willingly would bee thought to Patronize the least errour of the Church of Rome; neither, I hope, hath any thing euer passed my pen with so sleight consideration since I was able to deale in this cause, whereof I cannot giue a sufficient reason that it is farre from the defence of any error of the Romish Church.
               
               And therefore in my opinion, the late Authour of the Protestantes Apologie hath dealt somewhat vnkindly with mee and others, to alledge vs as witnesses for their side, but most inconsiderately, to the disaduantage of his owne cause, who now in the latter end beeing driuen from Scriptures, Fathers, and Councelles, are compelled to support themselues with the wrested mistaken Testimonies of such as haue and are willing to fight against them, and yet if wee erre of what valewe are our errours to conuince a trueth?
               The daunger of this euill, if it were fully considered by our brethren that will needes striue with vs, would make them forbeare all further contention in this cause; and Ioyne with our Church in cerimonyes, as they doe in doctrine, that all like the children of the same wombe might bee readye as with one heart and one voyce, to resist their subtill and malicious attempts, who vnder colour of Religion, and the Catholike faith, seeke treacherously the ruine, and subuersion

both of this Church, and this commonwelth.
               And therfore (in the Iudgment of all wise, and religious men) vnexcusable is their paynes, and trauell, who extend their witts to the vttermost of that they are able, to deriue an enuye vpon that gouerment, (as Infected with Popish superstition) wherein, hitherto they haue louingly peaceably and plentifully bene brought-vp.
               It seemeth that the vse of the Crosse in Baptisme offendeth not so much, as that the Infant by this means is dedicated to Gods seruice; because (say you) If dedicated (at which word you take all your offence) then either Initiated or consecrated (for the words in the Hebrewe doe onely signifie one of these two) of which if we graunt the first, you peremptorily conclude that Baptisme is made voyde, if the second that then this signe is operatiue and hath vertue in it: and yet (say you) in the true vse of speach, to dedicate and to consecrate is all one; I am sorry that in matters of this consequence for which men can perswade themselues that it is warrantable to forsake their flockes, that at the last, the conclusion being summed vp, it should bee onely a contention of wordes; yet I must tell you that to speake properly, and as men of Iudgment haue done before vs; to consecrate is to make of prophane thinges holy; to dedicate is when they are appoynted to some certayne GOD;P. Martir, loc. Com. Par. 4.9 fo

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , for to sanctifie as Peter,

                  Martyr saith, is nothing else but to apply to diuine & religious vses, or to prepare himself to offer some thing to God.
               Now if it may appeare (as doubtlesse it will) that not onely religious things were dedicated, but other things also, and that their dedication was in another kinde, without any worship diuine, but by first vsing; what inconuenience wil follow, if in the whole action of baptisme, and those prayers that are vsed, the Infant be dedicated, which in the canon is ascribed vnto the crosse, that being the onely externall cerimonie expressing the intention of the whole act? Thus Dauids house was dedicated, for which was made the thirtieth Psalme: the walles of a citie. Nehem. 12.27. were dedicated, which was nothing else, as P. Martyr saith, but that the wals of a citie being made vp, the people together with the Leuites and Priests, and also the Princes went thither, and there gaue thanks vnto God, because the walle; were reedified, and prayed that the city might bee righteously vsed. This kinde of Dedication was called by the Hebrewes Canach. The other which was Chadash, was to consecrate things holy to God. Now, which of these you vnderstand to bee done by the crosse in Baptisme, it will not bee greatly material against vs, seeing the verie act of Dedication or consecration dependeth not vpon the signe of the crosse, but yet so said, because the crosse is an anciēt significant cō
                  uenient signe of that act of dedication or consecration which is done in Baptisme, by the worde and prayer.
               For our Dedication in Baptisme is as it were, a surrēdering of al that tight which our parēts, or our selues might haue in our selues into Gods hands: wherein as

in the dedication both of the Temple and the Tabernacle, God gaue a manifest signe that hee tooke possession of both: so it standeth with reason, that on the Infants behalfe, hereafter to put him in minde, and for the present to admonish those that are lookers on, that the minister signe him with that badge, which is the ensigne of his merit & victory, whom the child must serue. The ancient vse of the crosse at all other times was for infidels, but in Baptisme for the good of beleeuers, which is intended still: but as they haue done in this, so they exclude the crosse in the dedication of Temples, as if it were all one to build a house to God, and a parlour or Kitchin to our selues; wherin though I allow not greatly, the superstitious number of twelue in the building of Churches: yet I am not altogether of their opinion, who hold crosses vnmeete at the dedication of Temples, which if some corruptly haue vsed to a false end, wee cannot but mislike their superperstitious intention, and yet retaine that warrantable signe, which wel becommeth that place, which ought to be the religious Schoole-house of Christs death. If wee may credit antiquity in the storie of Iulian, when hee looked the intrals of beasts (for south-saying,Sozo

                  inuenit crucem coronatam, hee found a crosse with a crowne, from whence some collected Christian religion to be perpetuall, and that Iulian could not ouercome it, others Angustias & quasi carceres crucis; but peraduēture more truely, to signifie an euerlasting Crowne purchased by his death, that suffered vpon the crosse; besides, in the garments of those Iewes which sought to reedifie the Temple at Iulians commaundement, there were imprinted crosses, as if that power that suffered ignominiously vpon the crosse, would testifie the

strength of his arme, even in that which they most contemned, shall wee then bee ashamed of that badge? or bee vnwilling to dedicate our selues vnto his seruice by that sygne, which was the note of his fearefull power to such as resisted his right hand, and so farre honored by the holy ghost that it often expresseth the whole meritt of his passion, by the bloode of the Crosse, so that if strange conclusions be not vrged vpon vs, It is neither to make Baptisme voyde, to say wee are dedicated by the Crosse, (ascribing that to the signe which is done in the whole act) nor to make it, or Baptisme operatiue in that sence, to say that by Baptisme and so manifested by that signe, we are consecrated to gods seruice, and that consequently, our dedication by this signe, is such as the auncyent fathers before poperye did vse.
               
               But least the Innocencye of the auncient tymes, should seeme to be a warrant for the simple vse of the Crosse among vs, (who thought it ever Honor and vertue enoughe to treade in the harmeles steppes of our forefathers) you laye an equall burthen for this corruption vpon them, as if nothing were ascribed to the Crosse, in or out of Baptisme by the rankest Papists (saving the very poynt of adoration) but the fathers are as deepely ingaged in the same; this If I had vttered, the Church of Rome would Iustly haue thought, that I had done them a great honor, in allowing their superstitious abuse of this signe, sauing onely in one poynt, to be the verye same 
                     •
                  or vertue, and power, as the auncyenter fathers did ascribe vnto it; so that whilst you desire to make the Church of England as guilty

of superstition in the vse of this signe, as they are now of the Church of Rome, you Inconsiderately and perhaps vntruely make the rankest papists no lesse Ignorant in that poynt, then the auncyentest and purest fathers haue bene before them: whatsoever is capable of corruption (as the best thinges and actions wherein man concurreth, of necessity are) (for wee haue all corrupted our owne wayes) commeth not vpon the sodayne to that height of euill but that more evident markes of the former Integritye remaine, which in continuance of time, are not onely blemished, but whollye turned into another corrupt nature.
               This is evident in that great and Antichristian defection of the trueth, which was not all eclipsed or ouershadowed at once; but Ignorance breeding superstition; superstition never satisfying it selfe in the surmised acts of religion, but erring in the excesse, as prophanenes in the defect, hath added daylye to the first corruptions, that she is nowe as the heade of a smalle riuer, which sendeth forth but one streame, which cannot knowe her owne daughter in, continuance of time, being growne like vnto an Ocean, by the manyfold additions of sundrie and strainge waters.
               The Histories of former ages doe record vnto vs the beginning, the increase the perfection of the grouth in the superstitious corruptions of the Church of Rome; and howsoeuer all agree not, when this defection beganne, yet most men knowe, that there was a time in

the priatiue age of our fathers, when few or none of the ceremonies of the Church were infected with such corruption as now they are. So that the seueritie of those is ouer great, who would wrap the fathers immediatly succeeding the Apostles time, with the same superstition (saue only in the point of adoration) wherwith the Papists are iustly accused to bee infected at this day: I confesse, when the Papists are charged by vs to haue corrupted the truth, by rehearsall of many false miracles done by the signe of the crosse, they alledge the testimonies of all fathers,Bellar. Marshall. saying (which you confesse, but I doe not) that they haue esteemed no otherwise of the crosse then the fathers of the Church haue done before them. Wee then say for satisfaction in this point, that it had beene equall and right in you, before the imputation of so much corruption to the blessed memory of those holy men, to haue showed what the Papists ascribe vnto the crosse, what the fathers, and what wee; No man can deny, but that God, after the death of his sonne, manifested his power to the amazement of the world in this contemptible signe, which peraduenture gaue iust occasion, beeing the instrument of so many miracles, that corrupter times, as those that succeeded were, did ouerburden it with fables and worshippe, the one false, the other Idolatrous, both seruing to poyson the after ages with dangerous superstition: the Church of Rome at this present, differeth from the ancient fathers, as we differ from them, in making the very crosse wherupon Christ died, to bee a relick, and all other crosses to be as Images: and lastly the vere figure made in the ayre, to haue a spirituall and diuine vertue, to cast out diuels and to worke miracles,Beller. lib. 2. de Imag. cap. 30. and as Bellermine saith Terret & fugat

daemones, pellit morbos, & omnia mala; sanctificat ea quibus imprimitur; which vertues or some of which, if God manifested in the crosse in the dayes of our forefathers,Sanctit as accedit rebus cum signantium cruce. to ascribe the same vnto now, is not to say truly as they fathers did, but superstitiouslie to err with the church of Rome, as if the power of healing which followed annoynting in the primitiue church, might be a warrant either for the annointing vsed amongst papists at this day, or imbolden any man to say that nothing is ascribed by the rankest papist (for that is your phrase) to annointing, but the fathers are as deeply ingaged in the same; so that whilst our church professeth the vse hereof as the fathers did, they neither tie themselues to the example of all, nor can be iustly denyed to haue the warrant of the soundest fathers for the vse hereof. For the moderate vse as now it is retayned in the church of England seemeth to be an apostolicall constitution, being accounted as a thing auncyently & generally receiued in Tertullians time, who was within two hundred yeares after Christ, and within lesse then a hundred yeares after, Saint Iohn,

And therefore in my opinion lesse excusable is their fault, who laye the imputation of false dealing with his maiestie by the Bishops at the conference, being informed (but as you say) (vntruly) that the papists neuer ascribe any power or spirituall grace in Baptisme vnto the Crosse; surely wisedome must account it if not malice, yet great rashnes to giue the ly to those reuerend persons, in answere whereof I only say thus much; that what the Bishops had informed his maiestie in this

Lib. 215 Signum crucis est ceremonia omnium communissima et antiquissima Aust Tract. 118, in Iohan. addeth (and I finde it to be true); and questionlesse those places alledged in your margent, do not proue that in Baptisme the papists ascribe any power or spirituall grace vnto the crosse: but onely make it a most auncyent and most common cerimonie, without which no Sacraments can rightly be performed. Wherein if following Saint Austin they go to farr

                   superstition which did cleaue vnto it, and therefore you need not excuse that reuerend assembly by laying the fault vpon some committyes, seing a little before you are not affraid to accuse them, for dealing with others, for the making of the Canons, as the fathers were vsed in the councill of Arimyne, and whom immediately in the words following, you iealously susspect, vnder the couert of phrases to surprise the truth; but as wisedome and iudgment is their honor, so reuerēce and obedience is our duety. So then to draw to a cō

                  fesse that we haue read many things in the ecclesiasticall histories, and the fathers in commendation of this signe, which at first peraduenture not euill gaue occasion of superstition to those that followed: many things we confesse to be fabulous & vntrue, sōethings perhaps counterfeited by Satan, other things true but not auaileable to warrant the blindnes of after times: some things which in those times might well be tollerated but not now: some things which euen in

But my reuerend Lord this so extreame vrging of it, in the Canon as to make the only omission of it (in a poore man who of a tender conscience and in detestation of the late popish and Idolatrous vse thereof shall forbeare it) so deepe a cause of seperating a man from all part in Christs death, as that the minister himselfe shalbe suspended if he suffer him to cōmunicate, seemes a charge of more waight, then an indifferent cerimonie should beare, & such as thrusteth mē vpon a breach of gods commaundemēt,Math. 15.6.

Now as man (as Damascen speaketh) is composed of two natures, Intellectuall and sensible; so he oweth and is to offer vnto god a two fold deuotion, the one spirituall, which consisteth in the inward minde, the other corporall in the outward humiliation of the body: this latter is rather for the furtherance of our selues & others,Iohn. 4. in the waies of piety, thē as a thing of it selfe acceptable to God, who being a spirit, is to be worshiped in spirit & truth: yet by this external gesture (the bowing of the knee) as by the manifest figure of our humility which corporally we performe: our inward affection cherefully is stirred vp, with alacrity & diligēce to discharge what belongeth to his inward worship: the vse of bowing the knee, when we either begg or receiue any thing from Gods hand, hath beene ancyent and warrantable in Gods church, and it is no lesse comely & behooueful for vs vpō our knees, to beg that the cupp of his blood may profitably and effectually passe to vs,Luk. 23 then for our sauiour himselfe prostrate to in treat, that the cupp of his passion might passe frō him.

For howsoeuer the motions of the body cannot well be, vnlesse the minde before be prepared with the same affection, yet euen that inward inuisible humilitie of the hart which gaue strength to this outwarde receiueth strength from it: and that which went before that it might be done, receiueth increase from it in that it is done: which decent behauiour if any mislike because what the church thinketh fit to be done it punisheth sharply when it is not done, these take vnto themselues a libertie, that whilst the church censureth worthely the disobedience of such as heare not her voice, these ouer boldly censure the church in that her voice, is not guided by their tongues. And if the punishment of excommunication be thought by any ouer greeuous for the omission of so indifferent a ceremonie (which in your opinion is a small offēce) you must know that wise men cannot account the offence small, where the disobedience is great; and the disobedience cannot be little, where there is a contempt of those lawes which the church doth make: nay as the seruants answered Nahaman the Syrian, if you had beene commaunded any great thing especially in the humility of our soules to

receiue so great a benefit, ought we not to haue done it? and therefore howsoeuer we pitty their case, yet vnexcusable is the error of those men who chuse rather to want the food of their soule by this blessed sacrament, then to receiue the sacrament prostrate vpon their knees, as if an opiniō of that superstitiō wherwith some others had stayned it, could hurt him that kneeleth in obedience and humility, especially knowing his owne heart to be vpright in that point, and seeing no reason sinisterly to suspect the vertuous intentiō of this church which professeth an vtter abolishing of al superstitious ceremonies. And therefore if you thinke the reuerend fathers of the church to deale with you and others in vrging of these things, as the men of Lyons and Vyenna, whose hurts being often and cruell, shewed that they fought for some further end thē for Nero and Galba: it is but your want of charity and not their fault. Neither do I se how that act can be fitting to this purpose, seeing as the trāslatour of Tacitus doth tell you in the margent; the first inhabitans of Lyons had beene driuen by force out of Vyenna and therefore were iustly to hate them as vniust vsurpers of that which was theirs.

to conclude as the church doth, that kneeling at the communion is a ceremonie lawfull, and fitly commaunded to be vsed &c. and that those iustly are excommunicate who refuse to doe it.

This hath made me earnestly and oftē to pray that the thirst of Innouation increased in many by the comming of his maiesty vnto this kingdome, did not inforce men through the euill counsell of some hypocriticall brethren, Iealously to suspect, and malitiously to depraue the cerimonies and gouernment of the church, when they had least cause. And amongst those manifould misteries which accompanyed the King into this land, this is not the least, that when a strong continuance of a setled truth, dispersing all wandering opinions vnder a learned prince, was more then hopefully assured to be the blessing of our Land, that then, euen then there should be an increase both of papists and puritans, as if both had discouered an extraordinary fauour, to be showed to either; but I can better satisfie my selfe in those of the church of Rome, then in the other, for all men in afflictiō (which surely though

not simply, yet comparatiuely was their case) are ouer apt to flatter themselues in all changes of a state, that some thing will ease them, but most especially then, when they see fauours and mercies almost not denied to any. But it is the distemper of euill humors that maketh false constructions, or collections from a mercifull Prince.

A wife and tenne children are strong motiues, but to flesh and bloud: thinke I pray you, and thinke seriously of Christs Church, how many of her children (as farre as in you lieth) are frustrate of nourishment by your meanes; and thinke that the ground of this losse eyther to your selfe, or to the family of Christ, is your

And therefore without any other answere, we will only put you in minde of those harsh speeches, which may peraduenture in this discontentment be agreeable to your fancie, but are no way sutable to your cause, nor verie well beseeming a man of your place.

Can you beleeue that your depriuation is a reuenge which some mens rashnes hath drawn vpon you? Is the proceeding of the reuerend Fathers, for the vnitie of the Church, as if Aemilius had faulted, and Rutilius should be beaten? or can you in your own conscience compare it with the perishing of the Iewes, for the not stooping of one Mardochey? assure your selfe none of them are so transported with ambition, nor so incensed with any particuler contempt offered vnto themselues, which they could not easily haue remitted, if their remissenesse in this had not hazarded the Churches peace.

in your case like fathers with their owne children, leauing nothing vnattempted to reforme your opinion, before they proceeded to giue sentence. A dutie that lieth vpon their shoulders, with as much indispensable necessitie, as conformitie and obedience vpon ours. Like vnto this surmise, is that which followeth; And say wee cannot confirme in euerie point, you know who said, the varietie of ceremonies did commend the vnitie of faith: But doubtlesse it had beene much better for the Church: more warrantable for your selues: more pleasing to the state: more profitable to your owne families: to haue conformed your selues in euerie poynt, then by refusing to hinder the Church of that good, which by your owne confession might haue beene more in one yeare then all the Ceremonies will doe whilest the vvorld standeth. For if any thing be imposed by authoritie contrarie to the word of God, let some men take vpon them to prooue it; and farre be it from vs for any mans cause to maintaine an euicted errour; wee may bee deceiued, and haue our infirmities as other men, but wee are not vnwilling, who will needes bee our aduersaries, to account them our maisters, if there bee iust cause.
               But if these ceremonies be onely vnlawfull to some men, for want of true resolution, and so contrarie to conscience (which yet is no warrant for disobedience) let them learne to know that in things not vnlawfull; It is better to obey, then to offer Sacrifice. Amongest men of equall authoritie in place of freedome, diuersities of opinions may safely be published without offence, but where men want authority and place to aduise, and when Iawes haue set

downe what is though fit, there, to thinke otherwise then the Church doth, it is, as if common passengers would sayle to Chyna, by the North-east, when the maisters and gouernours had determined to sayle by the North-west.
               
               Wherein if both partes remayne equally stiffe in their owne opinions, a mutinie must follow for want of Discipline: sometimes I confesse varietie and alteration of cerimonies are thought fit; both to shew the authoritie of the Church, (for you selfe haue confessed when you read your articles that euerie particuler or nationall Church hath authoritie to ordayne,
                  
                     Articles of 156. Artic. 34. 
                  change, and abolish ceremonies, or rites of the Church ordained onely by mans authoritie, so that all things bee done to aedifying.) Secondly, that they are but furtherances of deuotion, and no partes of diuine worship.
               But when they are established as thought fit for decencie, edification, and order, by such as haue authoritie from Christ to moderate those thinges: then by inferiour persons (such as wee are) eyther to bee oppugned, misconstrued, despised, or disobeyed, it is daungerouslye, to kindle a fyre of Rebellion in the principall parts of Gods house. But that which followeth, is much worse.
               
                  O my good Lord, will it not bee enough to keepe safe and well fenced your Iurisdictions and personall dignities? not enough to deuide the Honours to your selues, and labours to vs? Haue the last Canons no other end, but to fence the Iurisdictions, and personall dignities vnto the B B. Doubtlesse the diminishing of their honors, which could neuer haue been without wrong

vnto the Church, was little to be feared (though the Canons had not beene) where so wise a King ruled ouer vs, who had throughly tasted the calamities and miseries of that Church, which placed the greatest part of their Zeale in suppressing of Bishops; and whilest they laboured that none might haue too much, they presently brought it so to passe that scarce any had what was reasonable enough: besides if you knew the vnwearied paines, the intollerable burthens, that diuers of the Reuerend Fathers, who watch ouer vs dayly, sustayne for the peace and the happinesse of this Church,Episcopi. you would plainely acknowledge preaching not to be the greatest paines, and that it is a misdeeming of their care to thinke, That they haue deuided the honours to themselues, and the labours to you. Surely there is no greater or more vehement exercise of faith amongest so many perils, then prayers for the publicke peace of the Church, and it is our parts to vnderstand those perils, and to iudge them to appertaine to our owne safeties.
               Besides it is our dutie to ascribe to the Magis
                     •
                  rates, Wisedome and Iustice, that is, that wee doe not preferre our priuate iudgements before the lawes, and decrees of the Church, but obey them: This honour is most agreeable to publicke peace, not to cauill against the lawes, nor to interprete them with Iealousie or Enuie; but to couer, to excuse, and mitigate the ouer-sightes of Magistrates and lawes if there be any. This as it is in priuate the ornament of a Christian, so it is in publicke the honour of a good subiect.1, Cor. 13 Coloss. 3 
                  Loue beareth all things: Loue is the bond of perfection, to preuent dissolutions of a Church or a commonwealth.

And heerein if the requisite seueritie which the palsie of the Church exacteth from the Reuerend Fathers, draw them to punish, whom they desire to fauour, to aduance and cherish, it is not a casting out of borne Israelites (as you terme it) but a iust reprehension, setting a marke vpon that sonne, that hath made no conscience to discouer the supposed nakednesse of his owne father.Cha

In whose place it any wild beasts (Papists you meane) shall multiply, I doubt not but their religious care, will be as readie to suppresse the one, as depriue the other: And if in the ende (as you prophesie) (which God forbid) vnfortunately it happen, that the Bishops shall want you, as King Henry did Cromewell, it shall be much safer to indure the hazard of those times, then to buy an aduantage at so deare a price. In the meane time beleeue (which it is fit for you to acknowledge) that if you forbeare vpon the poynt of Conscience, their Lordshipps haue better reasons for that they do, then to stand vpon termes of their owne pleasures. Now to conclude this vnpleasing worke, which wee laid aside, in hope to haue rested without trouble, vntill such time as we saw their bookes of this argument to increase still, and heard that as much of this as was then printed, was by them confuted; wee desire all men to think of vs, as of those that account the infirmities of our brethren our owne harmes, and the modest directions of men as meane as our selues, to be no blemish vnto vs, who propound not victory,

of his Temple; giue vnto vs all vnity and peace, as the bonds and sinewes of the communion of saints; make vs to thinke and to speake the same things; grant vnto you and others that refuse conformitie vpon conscience a better light: peace in your hearts▪ remorse for silencing your selues; comforts against all worldly afflictions: and if it so seeme good to his infinite wisedome (seeing our Church hath so many trayterous and seditious enemies without) that all within her owne bosome, may thinke, loue, desire, and behaue our selues in all things as be. commeth the Saints of God.
