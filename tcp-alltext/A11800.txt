TYED, BETVVIXT GREAT Britaine and the Vnited Prouinces, by the wiſedome of King IAMES, and the States Generall; the Kings of France, Denmarke, and Sweden, the Duke of Sauoy, with the States of Venice being Witneſſes and Aſſiſtants.
            
               FOR THE WEALE AND PEACE OF CHRISTENDOME.
         
         
            
            TO THE READER.
            
               I Am to let all men know, that beſides thoſe grieuances which I haue fauourably and ſparingly mentioned & minced in theſe following Papers, I heare of another one ariſing which is of greateſt moment and likelieſt to produce moſt alteration, if it be not preuented. And that is the hard and extreme meaſure which the Merchant Aduenturers here ſetled, meet with in their Staple commodity. Concerning which if there be not order preſently taken, to giue them contentment, in ſome good and indifferent manner, but that they be forced to ſeeke courſes for reliefe of themſelues by their Petitions and Complaints to his Maieſtie (whereabout I heare they are meditating) a worſe buſineſſe then that of Eaſt Indya will breake forth to trouble both States, and alien hearts from each other. For it concernes the King: Peeres, and Commons when the Wooll is puld from their backes by any abuſe; ſince euerie condition of men in the Land, and almoſt euerie perſon, haue interest in that Commoditie. This breach therefore, I wish with all my heart were ſtopt by timely prouiſion, and the rude, boorish and proud diſpoſition of ſuch, in theſe parts, restrained, as by their too ſtrickt, ſurly, and imperious courſes, for their priuate profit prouoke the complaint of our people, and driue them to ſeeke eaſe and remedie by the ſhift of place and trade where they may hope to be better vſed, and to finde loue, reſpect, and iustice, with indifferencie.
         
      
      
         
            
            
               SYMMACHIA Or A true-loues knot.
            
               AS there is nothing of more moment (in humane conſiderations) for the advancement of religion, then the ſupportance, fauoure, and protection of potent Princes and States, who are or ought to be nurſeing Fathers and nurſeing Mothers to this end: ſoe there is nothing of more moment to inable the Kingdome of greate Brittanie and the Vnited Provinces to be ſuch (ſince the cheefe butthen and honor of this worke lies vpon their shoulders) then to vnite themſelues in perfect amitie togither. The enemye both to our Religion and State ſeemes to obſerue this better then our ſelues; ſince they haue vſed all endeauors to make breaches betwixt vs, and to keepe vs off from each other at an vnprofitable diſtance, where the force of our cold amitie could haue no powrefull effect to aſſiſt each other, or oppoſe them. They haue preuailed very farre to thir end, eſpecially vpon that part where they had leaſt hope, and where they imployde the leaſt

force of their witt, I meane vpon the Netherlandish ſide where jelouſie (to ſee vs treate with the enemye) hath cauſed many people in the Vnited Provinces to behaue themſelues towards vs, as Coy Dames vſe to doe, who thinke to winne their louers to more longing, by rude tricks of vnkindenes.
            I intend not to repeate the particulars, leaſt I should be thought, rather to reuiue old quarrells by renueing there memorie, then to ſtop farther breaches by burying all fomer iniuries in obliuion. Yet I muſt ſay, that if they should thinke, wee put vp thoſe affronts offered to our Nation in Groenlant and the eaſt Indyes, eyther out of feare of their ſtrength, or our owne weakenes, they should iniurie vs no leſſe in the conceit, then they haue done in the act. Religion only hath bownd our hands, and wee are ſatisfied that the State doth diſclame it, and caſt it vpon priuate perſons; otherwiſe wee were as well able to ſcourge them, as to defend them from ſcourging. It were an ingratefull part in them, whilſt wee indanger our ſelues by houlding vp theire chinnes, to keepe them from ſincking, that they s'hould with their heeles kick vs vnder water. But becauſe wee beleeve and know, that theſe wronges proceede not from the State, but from ſuch perſons (for the moſt part on both ſides) as loue Mammon better then Chriſt, and count gaine the only godlyneſs, therefore wee are not apt to heare or beleeue all that is ſuggeſted, nor to ſee all that is true, but to hope and promiſe our ſelues better vſe for the future; ſince they knowe and muſt confeſs, that neyther themſelues, not the proudeſt or potenteſt Nation vpon earth, can vpon equall terms (without politick ſurpriſall) aſſure themſelues to beate vs and be our Maſters; nor dare

(without manifeſt advantage) prouoke vs to the triall.
            But ſince humor hath beene ſoe ſtird vpon both ſides, that Prudence and moderation hath had enough to doe to keepe vs from breaking out into blowes, it was a timely worke of wiſedome in their State to ſeeke to ſtop the gap, and a gratious worke of our prudent prince to giue them audience (notwithſtanding the contrarie noiſe which buz'd about his eares) and to renue that ancient league betwixt vs, which was like to breake into enmitie. The foole hardy can charge hotly and ingage a State in warre, it muſt be the wiſe and aduiſed who only know how to make an honorable retreite. It is fit vpon both ſides, that now this league is renued, wee should be more carefull hereafter to preſerue it, then heeretofore wee haue beene. And to indeere the merrit of our State in this reſpect, it is fit to touch vpon ſome particulars whereby our Kindenes to them may be diſcerned, therby to beget reciprocall kindenes in them toward vs.
            1. Obſerue firſt wee were the parties wronged, and they the wrongers: yet they ſtood ſtifly out and ſought no reconcilement, till wee vnderhand, ſeeing their neceſſitie, both inticed them to ſeeke, and aſſured them to finde what they ſought. Heerein, being their ſuperiors in force, wee shewed our ſelues not to be their inferiors in wiſedome, which the wiſeſt amongſt them will acknowledge, though the weake will not ſee it, but attri, bute all to our duty; as if they ouer-reached vs in wit, when it is only wee that ouer-reach them in Kindenes.
            2. Obſerve the motion of the whole body of the State in Parliament, the concurrance of Nobles, Clergie, and Commons in this caſe of theirs; their humble earneſt and vnanimous ſutite to his Majeſtie for this end, their ſpeedy

and carefull (that I may not ſay curious) penning of the Lawe for their aſſiſtance, equally as for our owne Kingdomes, in theſe wordes. Moſt gratious ſouvereigne, wee your Majeſties moſt humble, faithfull, and loueing ſubjectes, by your Royal authoritie now aſſembled in your high Court of Parliament, haueing entred into ſerious and due conſideration of the weightie and moſt important cauſes, which at this tyme more then at any other tyme heeretofore, doe preſſe your Majeſtie, to a much greater expence and charge then your owne treaſure alone can at this preſent ſupport and manietaine; and likewiſe of the iniuries and indignities which haue beene lately offered to your Maieſtie and your children, vnder coloure and du
                     •
                  eing the tyme of the Treatyes for the Marriage with Spaine, and the reſtitution of the Palatinate, which in this Parliament haue beene cleerely diſcouverd and layed open vnto vs, and withalll, what humble aduice, with one conſent and voyce, wee haue giuen vnto your Maieſtie, to diſſolue thoſe Treatyes which your Maieſtie hath beene gratiouſly pleaſed, to our exceeding joy and comfort, fully to yeeld vnto, and accordingly haue made your publique declaration for the reall and vtter diſſolution of them, by meanes where of your Maieſtie may be happilie ingaged in a ſudden warre: wee in all humbleneſſe moſt ready and willing to giue vnto your Maieſtie, and the whole world, an ample, teſtimonie of our dutifull affectons, and ſincere intentions to aſſiſt yow therein, For the maintenance of that warre that may heere vpon enſue, and more particularly for the defence of this your Realme of England, the ſecureing of your Kingdome of Ireland, the aſſiſtance of your Neighbours, the States of the vnited Provinces, and other your Majeſties

friends and allies, And for the ſetting foorth of your Royal Nauie, wee haue reſolued to giue for the preſent the greateſt ayde which euer was granted in Parliament, to be leiued in ſo short-à tyme: And therefore wee doe humbly beſeech your Maieſtie, &c.
            
            Thus yow ſee in the body of our Lawe the State of the vnited Provinces is ſpecially nominated, and ranged in vnion with his Maieſties Kingdomes of England and Ireland, and the gift limited for the defence eſpecially of thoſe three. Which, though ſelfconceited eyes ouerſee, yet is argues much reſpect and loue; neyther doe I beleeue they haue giuen or receiued the like acknowledgement before to or from any other State; nor can wee redely finde in Hiſtorie the like interchange of loue betwixt forteigne people, recorded.
            2. Obſerue the moſt excellent Prince of Wales his forwardnes and extraordinarie diligence to accomplish this worke; I dare not ſay, whatſoeuer I thinke, that the whole frame was firſt of his compoſure, but I am ſure he was a principall Agent in the happy concluſion.
            3. Obſerue his Maieſtie how readely and gladly he grā
               ted when it cam to the vpshot: ſoe that he ſeemed to hold off before for politique reſpectes;
            Firſt, to beget a feeleing in our friends of their owne eſtate, who did not, in his Maieſties judgement, ſeeme ſenſible enough, for a long tyme, eyther of their owne danger, or of this his royall fauoure and benefite.
            Secondly, to make his owne ſubiectes the more eager and earneſt by the delay, and ſo giue them tyme to debate the buſineſſe, to vnderſtand the charitie and vtilitie of the worke, and to open their purſes the wider.
            Thirdly to ſecure the Enemye by this meanes, till all

were ready, that ſo wee might reflect vpon them, by a thinne and ſlight shadow the open and groſſe iniuryes they had done vs before, vnder the couerture of treatyes and truſt. Now for the better vnderſtanding of his Maieſties minde, in all pointes proportionable to this deſcription, I haue inſerted his privy Counſels letter to the Lords Lifetenants of Sheeres in England, for the aſſiſtinge of the Earls and Commanders in rayſeing men within their ſeuerall Countyes, and that by his Majeſties ſpeciall direction, for the ayde of the Vnited Provinces.
            
            AFter our harty commendations to your good Lordshippes, whereas the States Generall of the united Provinces haue by theyr Ambaſſadors humbly ſolicited his Maieſtie as wel to renewe the anciant defenſiue league betweene his Kingdomes and their Provinces, as alſo to permit them for the better confirmation thereof, to rayſe ſome good number of voluntary ſouldiers within his Dominions, to be imployed in theyr ſervice in theſe hazardous times, when the Emperour, and the Romish Catholique league are preparing, and drawinge downe towards theyr Countreyes, divers great and threatniug Troopes to joyne with thoſe Armies, that allreadie lye vpon theyr frontiers, ready to take the firſt opportunitie of advantage againſt them. And that his Majestie in a conſtant purſuite of the good amitie and correſpondentie with thoſe Provinces, hath treated, and concluded a league vvith theyr Ambaſſadors, and giuen way and permisſion for the rayſinge of ſix thouſand voluntary ſouldiers for theyr ſervice and asſiſtance, for theyr better ſtrength, and defence againſt thoſe forces of the Emperour, and Romishe Catholique

league: Which his Maiestie hath the rather aſſented to, in regard of his owne intereſt, both for the ſecurity of his owne Dominions, and the great part his ſonne in Law, his onely daughter, and his grand children haue in the preſervation of the Vnited Provinces where they now remaine as refugers. And becauſe the time of the yeare is ſo farre ſpent, as it will be requiſite to vſe all posſible expedition in the rayſing and tranſportation of theſe men, We haue thought it requiſite to giue your Lordshippes this intimation of his Maieſties good pleaſure, and aſſent for the levyinge of the ſayde voluntaryes, to the end you may not onely permit, and further our very good Lords, the Earles of Oxford, Southampton, and Eſſex, and the Lord Willoughby (appointed Collonels) and for that purpoſe deputed by the States Ambaſſadors, and ſuch other Captaines, and officiers vnder them as they shall ſubstitute, to leavy and take vp ſuch voluntary ſouldiers, as sball be vvilling to goe ouer in theyr company; but that withall you affoord them your beſt direction, asſistance, and furtherance therein, and giue notice of this his Maieſties pleaſure to the deputie Lieutenantes, Iuſtices of peace, and other his Maieſties Miniſters within the precinct of your Lieutenancy To which we doubt not, but you will all readily and effectually apply your ſelues both in reſpect of the generall cauſe, and for the eaſe and benefit the Countrey will finde in being disburthened of many vnneceſſary perſons that now want imployment, and liue lewdly, or vnprofitably in the Countrey. And if any of thoſe voluntaries shall after they haue accepted impreſſe money and ſo ingaged themſelues into the ſervice, withdrawe themſelues, or runne away from theyr Captaines, or Conductor, his Maieſties pleaſure is, that vpon any ſuch complainte,

you yeeld your beſt asſiſtance for the apprehendinge and recoueringe of thoſe fugitives, and them to comit to priſon vntill they ſubmit themſelues, or otherwiſe punish them, as is vſuall in ſuch caſes. And ſo we bid your Lordshippes hartly farewell. 20 of Iune. 1624.
            4. Obſerue the Peoples willingnes generally to offer themſelues to this ſeruice, and the expreſſion of extraordinarye ioy aſſoone as they heard the Drummes beate, and that the intent of their intertaniement was published, to ſerue the States of the Vnited Provinces againſt the King of Spaine and the Arch-Ducheſſe; ſoe that theſe wordes were forced to be altered by command, for preſent reſpects of State.
            5. Obſerue the Nobles, and thoſe none of the meaneſt, ſtriueing for imployment in this warre, not for the gaines of theſe poore and (in compariſon of them) petty places, but to honor their Nation, to shew the world amongſt what people they were nobles, to defend religion and that State which ioynes with our owne to defend it, to countenance the cauſe, to deter the enemye, to hold the Common man vpon the right ſide, to aſſure the adverſe part what ayde he is to expect from vs, and to ſtop the mouth of the clamorous Marchant, who, though he had iuſt cauſe to crye, yet cryes now in an vnſeaſonable tyme, and will therefore learne to giue ouer vaine clamoures whilſt he beholds the Peeres are ingaged in the worke which he would hinder.
            And heere I cannot but preſent this glaſſe to the v
                  •
               w of many young Nobles and Gentiles in theſe parts of the Vnited Provinces, who whilſt their Countrie is aſſaulted

by malitious Enemyes, and defended by honorable ſtrangers, both of our and other Nations, ſit ſtill themſelues and lend no hand to helpe it, but hold it rather a greate indignitie to be a ſouldiar. Theſe muſt needes be ignorant of their owne honorable rootes, which firſt ſprung from Armes and muſt be by that moſt honorable profeſſion mainetained whereof thoſe ſwordes are witneſſes, which none but Gentlemen weare amongſt them. And I am perſwaded therefore, this groſſe and effeminate conceite, is bred amongſt them, eyther by their too tender Mothers, who had rather ſee their Country perish, then to behold their children hazard themſelues for the ſafeguard of it; or from their Anabaptisticall neighbours who ſuppoſe (erroniouſly) all armes to be Antichriſtian; or from the Malignant papiſt, who though he hath the libertie of his conſcience amongſt them, yet becauſe he may not haue the free and publique exerciſe of his ſuperſtition, wisheth the Spanish iron yoke ouer the neck of the Belgick lyon, and deters his owne, and others, from their Countryes ſeruice, and hates ſuch to death, as ſerue to ſecure his libertie and life.
            But to returne to our matter, and to manifeſt our generall willingnes and allacritie for the vndertaking of there defence; I would neither haue the Common people ignorant, nor yet think vs ſo ſtupid not to vnderſtand the benefite of this defenſiue ayde ſent ouer to them at this preſent, which is greater then at firſt ſight itappeareth to all eyes. For beſides that wee helpe to defend there frontires at our owne charge, which all ſee, wee alſo ſpend the meanes, which wee receiue out of England, amongſt them alſo, ſo they haue the vſe both of our men and monye, which makes tradeing ſomething quicker

ſetting many trades on worke, and filling the publique purſe ſomething fuller by exciſe and other dutyes, which all obſerue not. What ready mony hath beene diſburſed in their Countrie for Hats, Armes, and other neceſſaries to furnish theſe troopes is apparant to all, and the laborious Tradeſman taſtes of the dooble benefite, and will bleſſe God for it, howeſoeuer the ignorant and inſoleut will not acknowledge to haue receiued heereby ſo much as a ſingle curteſie. For I heare them obiect, in ſcorne, that all this is not giuen but lent, they must repay it. True, as they did the money for the Cantionarie townes of Flushing in Zeland, and the Briell, in Holland, with the Caſtle of Ramekins in the Iſeland of Waltheren which came to 818000lb, which firſt vpon ſuite to his Maieſtie they inſtald for 40000 by the yeere, and continued the paymēt thereof for fiue yeeres, but after, finding it heauy, they againe ſought eaſe of his Maieſtie, and gratiouſly obtayned a generall releaſe and poſſeſſion of their townes and Caſtle for the ſumme of 200000 payde to his highneſſe, and of 25000, aſſigned by his Maieſties bownty towards the reward of the Officers. Which abatement proceeded neither from our want (for then it had beene a moſt vnthankefull part in them, not equally to reſpect our want in the repayment, as wee did their in the lending) nor out of the exceſſe of their witt (as ſome would arrogantly haue it) but out of there humble ſuite, and his Maieſties grations and ready graunt: Who conſidering what became his honor would giue rather then receiue, and would not defraude that truſt which was repoſed in his predeceſſor, and ſo ſuccesſiuely in him, but redeliuered the Keyes of their Country into their owne poſſeſſion againe. And this may teach them to ſee

that it is not in the power of one Stanly or one Yorke, to ſtaine the honor of a Nation; but they may as ſafely truſt vs, as themſelues; prouided they be ſure of their religion whome they truſt. If they be careles in admitting Captaynes and officers, they may well ſuſpect ſuch ſo admittted: but if they know them faithfull to God, they neede not doubt their fidelity to them. And it is not only ours, but all other Nations, yea their owne moſt of all, who are to be ſuſpected and ſo kept from Command, if eyther they bee of no religion or popishly affected: If of none, then they are for any Deuill that will tempt them (and Mammon eſpecially is then the God they worship) if popish, then they are for Antichriſt, and ſo for the Catholique King, who is his beſt beloued ſonne, and like to be the heyre of all that he can giue him. For he vſeth his eccleſiaſticall Keyes to no other end, but to open and shut the heart, and all other houlds, for the intertainement of the Spanish pompe and pride, and for the inlargement of that quinteſſentiall Monarchie, though the ſpirit of God by the Mouth of Daniell ſay the contrary neuer ſo peremtorily and plainely.
            But ſome obiect the Kinges bownty in this reſpect proceeded from the conſideration of his owne charge, which he should haue beene at in keepeing thoſe places, meerely for the proffit of the vnited Provinces. Perhaps indeede this was the cauſe which made him the more willing to part with them, vpon their ſuite, and his Counſells aduice: but this doth not leſſen his bownty, not their obligation. For to keepe a chargeable gage, for an other mans benefit, ſo long as the owner pleaſeth, to reſtore it ſafely and better in euery refpect then it was at the firſt ingagement, and that when the owner deſires it, and

vpon no termes of aduantage but vpon ſuch as he himſelfe preſcribes, witneſſeth extraordinary honeſtie in the lender and deſerues extraordinary thankfulnes from the borrower. Indeede the firſt motion for reddidition of theſe places proceeded, perhaps, from ſome who wished well to the Spaniard, and did not like the continuance of this their dependancie vpon England, who was by theſe cautions really and perpetually in point of honor, and proffit, and interest, ingaged for the defenſe of their State and title equally with themſelues: And this was ſeconded by a windie humor bred in a few others by proſperitie and peace, which looked not ſo farre as the firſt mouersayme, but ſuppoſeing themſelues able to ſtand vpon their owne feete, thought ſcorne to hold any longer of others, and began to meditate how to forget the hand that helped them vp, and to requite that curteſie with quarrells: which they could not doe ſafely (they ſaw) whilſt wee had thoſe pawnes in our cuſtody. But for the carriage of our Queene of bleſſed memoire deceaſed, of our preſent ſouuereigne, of our Counſell and State in generall, there was no paſſage eyther in the firſt taking of them on, in the holding, or restroreing of them, but ſauours of religion and honor in all apprehenſions, and will do ſo to all generations heereafter.
            Againe they obiect that our preſent ayde lent them is for our owne ſake; ſince our Parliament generally apprehended theſe Countryes to be as the bulwarks or at leaſt as the Counterſcarfe and outworks of our owne land: and it was wiſely ſayde of a greate Commander in his ſpeech made to the Parliament, Anno 1621. that if wee looſe the Counterſcarfe though it be beyond the ditch, the whole fortification is accounted loſt. For the Rampie
                     •
                  
               
               
               ſerues but for a defence to make compoſition, ſo that if wee wilbe content to looſe the counterſcarfe, then wee muſt preſently thinke of nothing but making a faire compoſition, or ſuch, at leaſt, as the beſieger will afford vs. And wee willingly ackowledg this to be a truth, wishing them to do vs good for their owne ſake, as they ſee vs do them good as they ſay for our owne ſake. If wee count them our out-workes (as wee doe) they ought to count vs as the marketplace, or Sanctwary or heart of the Citty which thoſe outworkes are appointed to guard. They count themſelues and the world generally and worthely counts them, to be a wiſe, politique, and prouident people; let them therefore shew it in this particular, loueing vs and doeing vs all the good they can piouſlie for religion ſake, curteouſlie and readely for neibourhoods ſake, faithfull for friendships ſake, or at leaſt politiquely for their owne ſakes.
            
            Againe they obiect our people are imployde by this meanes, and ſo our State pruned, drayned, and disburthened of many vnruly and vnneceſſarie members. This is very true alſo; for our nation (as ranke ſoyles yeeld many weedes, and ranke witts many extrauagancies) bringes forth many people, and withall ſpirits of extraordinary temper for the warre; which might be attributed to our diet (ſince wee eate more ſolid flesh then any other Nation in Europe) but that wee likewiſe finde all that is bred in our Climate (as appears by our Maſtiues and Cocks of the game) are of a more noble and generous ſtraine (as I may ſay) then many others. Theſe fiery Spirits are often moſt vnruly, ſo that their parents are weary of them, and ſeeing they will take no courſe to liue otherwiſe, cloth them furnish them with mony, and expoſe

them to the warres. Many of theſe haue the wit and grace to come ouer well pronided, as their parents ſend them ont: others will not leaue England till their Mony be ſpent, their clothes worne out, and then ashamed, with the prodigall, to returne home for new ſupplyes, they come ouer into theſe parts ragged (as wee ſee) a shame to their parents and Nation. Others leaue their trades, and runne from their Maſters; and this is the true canſe of theſe ragged and naked regiments, where you may ſee good bodyes of Men, very ill apparrelled. And by theſe ofſcoureings, men Geſs at the pouerty of our State, forgetting they come, though naked, from the land of Broad-cloth, and that this raggednes of theirs, in ſo rich a Countrie, is one euident note that they are made and marked out, for the warres. Indeede therefore wee confeſſe theſe men finde imployment heere by this meanes and withall this State findes defence. Beſides the ſtock is our owne, wherewithall they are ſet to worke: for wee, with our owne monye!, clothe them, furnish and arme them in all points compleat for the feild, with this charge, that they should fight for theſe Prouinces as they would fight for Brittanie. And were it not in regard of Religion (which wee alwayes prize and preferre before all other reſpects) and in regard of the ſafety of both States, which equally concernes vs, wee could haue the ſame imployment againſt them which wee haue now for them, and that vpon fatre better termes. Where then were they (but that theſe reſpects do tye vs to them) if our King (which God forbid) should ſend ſo much monye and ſo many men againſt them to the Enemye? The moſt purplind and partiall perſon may ſee the iſſue, and ſo behold this benefite, in the contrary danger.
            
               
To tempt vs with iniuryes therefore, and not to ſee their owne inſtant neceſsitie, becauſe the necesſity which we politiquely feare & would preuent ſtands in their light, is an intollerable ouerſight vnworthie of their wiſedomes.
            To preſume they may do vs hurt without danger, becauſe wee will doe them none, but indanger our ſelues to keepe them from hurt (as being moſt carefull of their wellfare with reſpect to our owne aſſurance and theirs in common) is a madneſs beyond all meaſure. As if I should rob my neighboure and vndoe him, becauſe I know him buſied in watching my houſe, to ſaue me and himſelfe from robbing and vndoeing.
            
            Since now wee haue ſufficiently declared our owne kindeneſs, in wooing the vnited Provinces to reciprocall curteſies, and the neceſſitie of our ſtanding together, except both of vs intend to fall; I proceede breefely to perſwade both Nations to take better notice of the Enemyes traines and deuiſes inuented to deuide vs, that ſo wee may vnite our ſelues to each other more cloſely by vndiſſoluable knots of loue and amitie. And becauſe theſe troopes of English newly raiſed may ſome of them out of ignorance giue or take offences which might eaſely be auoyded; I (whoſe care and ſtudy it is to do good offices betwixt them, and to preuent what is poſſible all shadow of vnkindnes which may ariſe) euen in the leaſt circumſtance haue vſed that liber
                  •
               y of ſpeech in the diſcourſe hitherto vnto which I am accuſtomed and naturally inclined: Which, though ſome may miſ
                  ••
               ke who neither know me nor the matter, yet I knowe ſuch honeſt and downeright freedome to be moſt fit and profitable for the continueing of friendship and cleereing of the caſe, which

liberty I deſire leaue to vſe in that which followes alſo; for beſides that the ſtrocks of a friend are pleaſant, in being profitable, I vnderſtand this buſines hath need of plaine dealeing, vnder whoſe ſeuere conduct all affayres proſper, better then in the perpetuall Cockering of foolemakeing and foole-fauoring flatterie.
            And firſt for my owne Nation, I deſire they would not bee too iealous, captious, and curious in takeing vnkindnes where none is offerd. Some perſons haue the trick to pinne their intereſts and particular ſpleenes vpon the publique ſleeue: and ſo what they haue felt or do feele in priuate, muſt needes bee a generall greeuance: but wee muſt be wiſe and wary, not to ſuffer quarrells which may fall betwixt particulars, to troble or diſturbe the generall peace; whilſt wee ſee thoſe iniuryes are not backt by authoritie, and made vniverſall and nationall.
            And if wee muſt not ſuffer real actions to diſturbe our affections, much leſſe should wee permit wordes to do it, eſpecially euill words from ſuch perſons as haue not yet learned to ſpeake well.
            It is true that Ladyes and gentlewoemen paſſing the ſtreets iu ſtrange habits, do often penance amongſt the ruder ſort, (as appeared by that moſt vnciuill and barbarous demeanoure vſed lately towards an English Lady in Amſterdam who deſired to ſee the Cittie, and ſuppoſed all gouvernements to be as ciuill as Londen) but we muſt conſider the ſame ſet of people would wonder aſmuch at a Parrat or Poppiniay. It is true alſo that men of all rankes meete often amongſt boyes words of reproch; but, beſides that wee cannot altogither cleere our owne in ſome rude places from that barbariſme, what should ſuch words of ſcorne ſpued from ſuch mouthes moue vs?

Since indeede it is our glory to be thoſe English Dogs, that haue holpen the Shepheards to chaſe from hence the Spanish Wolues, who elſe would haue worryed, not only theſe ſilly Lambes, but the harmeles and innocent Sheepe, their Fathers. Let not this ſtirre the courage of a Man to fury, but pitty and ſcorne; as Lyons vſe to walke with contempt amongſt barkeing whelpes, whoſe shrill notes are muſick, whilſt the Puppies bite not. Aſſuredly theſe boyes would, and doe too often, vſe their Parents thus; they know no better; they neuer learned a leſſon of obedience, much leſſe of gratefullnes, to honor thoſe in duty who defend them in loue, and often fauours them as the Pellicane doth her younge, whome in extremetie, she foſters and cherisheth with her owne blood.
            It wilbe imputed a folly to me to touch this, but I haue ſeene ſome touched with it. It often falls out that men who affect honor, as it is the ſouldiars ayme, are more offended with reproches and ſcornes then actual iniuryes. And if it were not ſo, theſe ſpirits would not ſell their flesh and blood ſo cheape, farre vnder the rate of beefe, or mutton, veale, or porke, nor would they indure heate and cold, and hunger and thirſt, when ſeruants (haueing more wages) will not, but that there is an ayer of praiſe and hope which they (Camelion like) feede vpon, and it kills their hearts to heare this blowne away by a ſtinkeing breath with diſgracefull language. It were eaſie for them by any honeſt trade or courſe of life to liue well in their owne Countryes, for meere neceſſitie doth not bring them ouer hither, as if wee wanted meate and drinke in England, France or Scotland, but eyther they are brought hither to be punished for their idlenes, & becauſe they would not at home doe a little eaſie worke for

great wages, are forced heere, as in a houſe of correction, to do great worke, yea the hardeſt of all (to ouercome manie wants, and difficulties, themſelues, and others) for little wages: Or elſe, being men made and marked out for the warres, they ſeeke and deſire this kinde of life, and would choſe it amongſt all others as the moſt honorable, though they had nothing for their laboure, but the oportunity and lawfull authority, to erchange knocks freely. For they deale for honor, as marchants for proffit; and they ſtampe in flesh and blood, as the other mint in gold and ſiluer. Now then the firſt ſort meeteing diſgracefull words meets but his deſert, it is part of his punishment to be reproched and reuiled: but this latter, who is only couetous of honor, takes it ill, to haue this counterfeit coine of diſgrace, put vpon him in ſtead of currant money. But I would not haue any of theſe latter ſort looke ſo lowe to ſtoope to ſuch pettie praiſe, nor contrarilie once caſt their eye aſide to theſe ſonnes of Belial, children of Bethell, who would mock Elizeus if he came amonge them with a bald head or a ſtrange habit, Nay rather I would haue them doe all good they can for the generall State of theſe Countries, with reſpect of thoſe good people who are mixed amonge the wicked, and mourne for the abhominations which are done in the Land. Deare Countrimen, you that be at home in peace, pay your monyes freely for the ſupportance and defence of theſe, pray for them with vnfained faith; and you, worthyes, that are heere, fight for them with vndaunted reſolution, and, if neede bee, dye for them with comfort and cheerefulnes euen as for your owne Countrye; ſince, as I haue manifeſted, the warre is the ſame though a little farther remoued, and beſides that it is alſo a religious

warre, being for religion, if the warriours themſelues haue any religion in them.
            Againe I am to exhort my Countrimen, who are comprehended vnder the name of greate Brittaines, to shew themſelues as ſtrong being now vnited, as they haue shewne the mſelues heeretofore being diuided. Let both the English and Scottish Nations declare by action that they haue not loſt their old hearts by takeing vpon them a new name; but that they are the ſonnes of thoſe Fathers whoſe braue blood, ſpilt in the warres, hath inriched and manured theſe feilds, with France, Spaine, and Paleſtine, and are ready to do it againe for the propagation of Chriſtian Religion, and for gaineing free and aſſured paſſage to the glorious Goſpell of our Lord leſus Chriſt.
            Laſtly I deſire & exhort with all earneſtnes that they would be carefull to ſerue the vnited Provinces faithfully, and not to deceaue them in the leaſt reſpect: whilſt therein they ſerue or deceiue their owne Prince and Country, with whoſe monyes they are payde, and shall reape praiſe and honor or shame and obloqui of their friends at their returne home according as they behaue themſelues in theſe imployments abroade.
            And now haueing done with our owne, I am in moſt humble manner, to preſent theſe petitions following which I haue learned from the obſeruation of my Countrimen to the conſiderations of my ſuperiors in theſe parts, in whoſe power it is to redreſſe the enormities thereby to declare, that they prize vs, as wee doe them.
            Firſt that they would be gratiouſly pleaſed, to heare the Old ſoldi
                     •
                  rs ſueing for better pay, and deſireing to be diſcharged oftheir moſt chargeable and vnconſcionable

               Sollicitours, who eate them vp by lewish vſurie in an vnreaſonable manner, Soe as I haue heard diuers conſcionable Commanders ſay, it is almoſt impoſſible for an Officer to liue (though neuer ſo meanely and modeſtly) vpon his meanes, except he deceiued the State or Soldiar; Since moſt of his owne meanes is ſwallowed vp by the ſollicitor. O that it would enter into the heart of thoſe prudent Lordes, to take a courſe for better payment, that the Captaines might not haue iuſt occaſion to complaine, nor Coloure to ſeeke shifts by curſed atteſtations, there by to deceaue the Country of bodyes, and themſelues of ſoules. Then your Companyes would be fuller, and the officer would ſerue with better courage, becauſe with better conſcience. Yea then, if deceite should be vſed or offered, none would pitty the guilty delinquent, though he were made an publique example and ſpectacle of fraude, vnworthy his profeſſion. I ſay vnworthie his profesſion, for I know, whatſoeuer othermen vainely thinke, that a reall lye is more dishonorable (though cuſtome and companie cloudes it) then a verball, which is ſo haynous to the eare and reputation of a ſouldier.
            But I heare an obiection againſt this ſuite, which I dare not mention without craueing pardon aforehand, and this it is, as they ſay, God knowes the truth of it; That if Sollicitors were diſcharged and better payment made, then diuers of the Natiues should looſe excellent offices, the Generall State let goe a faire improuement, and diverſe great perſons could not put their monyes out to vſurie vpon ſuch vnreaſonable conditious. I cannot beleeue this profitable ſinne, can barre the doore againſt iuſt reformatiō, though the inſolencie of the Solicitors would perſwade me to beleeue it; who preſumeing, as it ſeemes

and as the ſucceſſe shewes, vpon ſupportance, dare affront the greateſt Commanders and vſe them as ſeruants not like Maſters by whome they liue. Sometyme Solicitors haue beene put vpon Captaynes by force, and they authorized to take from the Captaynes ordinance the beſt part of his meanes though the ſolicitor neuer advanced him a penie of mony aforehand, but becauſe he contracted with his Predeceſſor; Soe that if a cunning Companion who hath a little ſpare monie can inſinuate himſelfe into the boſome of a needy or negligent Commander, and ſupplyeing his preſeut wants, faſten a peece of mony vpon him, and procure from him an inconſiderate contract, for his life only, let it be neuer ſo vnreaſonable, yet his ſucceſſor muſt continue it, and make it good, nay, perhaps increaſe it out of his meanes; and ſo ſucceſſiiuely from generation to generation, if the wars should continue it would continue like a rentcharge vpon the Captaine or campanie; whereby it cometh to paſſe, that though a Captayne, who venters life and all for the State, hath but a terme of life in his Captaineship; Yet the ſollicitor, for layeing out a hundred or two hundred pownd, hath halfe the Captaynes meanes, and a perpetuitie in that halfe, though he doe nothing for the State but helpe to vndoe it. Beſides though theſe perſons be taken on, that the ſouldiar may haue ſound pay, for which the Captayne payes ſoundly, as I haue partly shewed, yet their payment is ſoe bad, that there are few Captaynes (I might ſay ſafely, none) put haue iuſt cauſe to complaine, if their iuſt complaints might be heard and redreſſed.
            But ſuch is the vnequall condition of the perſons and the odd and diſreſpectiue carriage of the tyme towards them, that the Captaine contracting with the ſolicitor,

is bownd for his part, and the ſolicitor is his owne iudge, and carues himſelfe what amendes he liſt
                  •
               eth out of the Captaynes meanes: but the ſolicitor, contracting with the Captaine, is notwithſtanding looſe for his part, or as good as looſe, ſince he cares notfor keepeing his day, but often puts the Captaine to borrow, and pawne his credit and clothes vpon intereſt for payment of his companie, when notwithſtanding he payes vſe to the ſollicitor for aduanceing it aforehand; Nay ſay the Captaine forbeares it a moneth or two (as ſometyme it falls out) yet he payes vſe for it, and the ſollicitor will not abate a ſtiuer, though the one looſeth and the other gaines by this meanes, a dooble vſe.
            There is alſo a gaines made to the ſolicitor by payment of light money, which he knowes the Captayne muſt be forced to put away, cannot keepe to change; with many other groſſe and intollerable abuſes of which I haue heard Captaynes complaine, and which crye out (for the with-houlding of the labourors due is a cryeing Iam. 5. 4.ſinne) eyther to the State for redreſſe or to God for judgement. I ſee what account David made of his worthies and ſouldiars, and how pretious their blood was in his fight, when refuſeing to drinke of the water they fetched for him with perill of their lines, Hee powred it out to the Lord and ſayde My God forbid it me that I ſhonld doe 
               1. Chro.
               this thing; Shall I drinke the blood of theſe men that haue 
               11. 18.
               put their liues in ieopardie? for with the ieopardie of their liues they brought it, therefore he would not drinke. I wish that all ſolicitors and vſurers would conſider this ſtorie well, and then they wonld not (except they were right Nabals) make it their dayly trade to drinke vp, nay to be drunke with the blood of ſuch men, and that whilſt

they are watching that theſe may drinke the ſafer, and fighting for ſafeguard of that mony, whoſe vſe eates them vp to the bare bones. But if theſe lewes and bloodſuckers will not conſider it, yet it concernes Dauid and the worthies of this State to looke to it better, and to their care and conſcience I commend it. For if this be not reformed, as it shewes inward corruption and putrifaction, ripe for diſſolution, ſo it may, at one tyme or other, by one meanes or other, put the State to ſtraights and difficultyes, did not the auxiliarie Bandes take care for it, to defend it, and reſpect it, as their owne Countrie. Which care of theirs appeared the laſt yeere, at the comming out of that Placat, which gaue them, generally ſo much diſcontent, and that in the inſtant when they expected the Enemy. Which had beene a fit tyme and occaſion to tempt them to mutinee, but that faith, h onor, and religion reſtrayned them; yea ſuch a tyme; as would haue occaſioned ſome Nations then to crye for gelt and reformation, or alſo to lay downe their armes. Whereas then, all theſe troopes, both British, and French, did nobly and loyally reſolue, not to diſpute the point before the fight, but firſt to fight, and ſo to diſpute the point againſt the Enemye with the edge of their anger and points of their ſwords, that they might by their deſerts moue the States to repeale their act, and to shew they meritted augmentation by way of largeſſe, rather then abatement or abridgement, by way of defalcation; which they would intimate by humble petition, without diſputation, after the ſeruice was done and the Enemye gone off, and not before. And this reſolution they generally followed, whereby they deſerued dne conſideration, and I doubt not in tyme but they shall finde it. They are Tyrants and not Fathers of the

Commonwealth, who take occaſion to be euill, from the goodnes of their people; ſo that the better the ſubiect or inferior is, the worſe the ſuperior shews himſelfe to bee; and the more he is content for peace, and quiet, and conſcience, to ſuffer, the more the other puts vpon him and forceth him beyond his ſtrength to beare and ſuffer. It shall not be ſoe amongſt you, (ſaith our ſauiour to his Diſciples) I hope the illuſtrious Lords are our ſauiours Diſciples alſo, and I am ſure then, It shall not be ſoe amongſt them.
            
            Secondly I beſeech the State to conſider whether or no it be fit to vindicate the honor of our king, State and Nation, together with the King and Queene of Bohemia, from the baſe aſperſions caſt vpon them, by rumor and lyeing multitude, in the point of their preſent maintenance. For I know the Common people beleeue, and giue it out, for a manifeſt truth, as men that will beleeue no better, how that royall Payer with their Princely children, lye heere at the charge of this State, and that exactions are layde vpon the people to mainetayne them in that humble condition wherein they liue, which (notwithſtanding it be farre too meane for the dignitie of ſuch perſons,) yet in the vulgar eye it ſeemes therefore to be to haughtie, becauſe they think it comes out of their purſe, and to proceed from their beggarly beneuolence.
            This falſehood is bred and nourished by the Spanish faction, who would do worſe then ſlander them if they could, and doe this to make the Countrie hate them, and thereby to prouoke the people for their ſake, to mutinee and riſe againſt the preſent gouernement of the illuſtrious Lords, as if they were the occaſion of this cauſeles and needles cha
                  •
               ge, by harboring theſe diſtreſſed Princes

in their Dominions.
            The knowledge of this was one of the principal motiues which cauſed me firſt to put penn to paper in this ſubiect; becauſe I ſaw the honor of my King, Countrie, and of theſe Princes traduced and toſt vp and downe by lewde lyeing, and ignorant tongues. For, in ſtead of charging this State with their aboade heere (as theſe fellowes faine and giue out) they are euery way helpefull to it, ſpending therein many thowſand pownds ſtarling by the yeere, and cauſeing much to be ſpent, all which comes out of England into theſe parts. And I preſent it to the conſideration of my ſuperiors, whether it were fit, for all their honors, and ſafetyes, to crye this off, or to make the truth of it ſome way publiquely knowne, that the malitious mouthes of men may in this reſpect be cloſed, and that the people may know they beare no burthen but their owne, yea that wee alſo doe helpe them, out of loue, to carry part of that, which belongs to them wholly to beare, out of duty to God and their Country.
            Thirdly I humbly preſent this motion to the conſideration of my ſuperiors, whether they thinke it fit or no, for the conſolidation of this league, and for the preſeruation of perpetual amitie betwixt both Nations, to equall vs, if not with their owne, at leaſt with the cheefe of other Nations, who ſerue them as wee doe; ſince wee haue beene, are, and are like to bee, as good ſtudds and props to this State, as they or any of them haue beene, are, or can bee. Let not the aduantage of language make a ſtricter band, then that of hearts and hands. If their tongues goe before ours, our hearts and hands goe in front with them, and haue euer done ſo, to do this State ſeruice. Neither ſpeake I this to diſparage them or any of

them; It is no diſparagement for the beſt of them, to march with vs; Neither ſpeake I this to detract from their deſeruings, but by compariſon of theirs to ſet off our owne (which hath beene nothing inferior to theirs) and ſo to beget equall reſpect for equall merrit in all ranckes and degrees.
            Fourthly I preſent to the wiſe conſideration of my ſuperiors, whether they thinke it fit or no, that in both the Indyes and all other places of trade or fishing, their people be ſtraightly commanded carefully to mainetaine peace; that they ſell not our loue for a little lucre, nor inuade our ſimple truſt and innocent ſecuritie, with fraude or violence, vpon baſe aduantages of tyme, and odds of number, or the like circumſtances of trecherie and iniurie; which, as they may be shadowed with the cloake of Iuſtice, ſo they may ſerue our Enemyes, (who ſeeke to deuide vs,) as shaddowes to accuſe the vnited Provinces of iniuſtice, and thereby to incenſe our State to ſodaine rage and sharpe reuenge againſt them as againſt perfidious Enemies. And I could therefore wish that if any should dare to diſobay the Edicts of the State published for pacification, they may be perſued as publique Enemyes, who by their practiſe teſtifie the treaſon of their hearts, whilſt they endeauoure to giue diſtaſte to our State, thereby to breake the loue and league betwixt Great Brittanie and the vnited Provinces, that ſo their Troian Horſe or Spanish Iennet may come in at the breach.
            Fiftly I would heere ſpeake of honors and rewards to be propounded for the ſouldiar of all ſorts and degrees, but that I am afraide to be laught at for my labor, or if not ſo, yet to be anſwered with that Common Error which goes currant for an axiome of State, That Commonweales
               
               are incapable of this power to conferre honors. I ſee amongſt the Romans, ſeuerall rewards and honors of all ſorts, diſtributed freely and conſtantly to the beſt deſeruers. Thereby to incourage all of euery ranck, high and low, the witty and valiant, in their ſeuerall kindes, to do their beſt, and to aduenture for the publique good. Titles, honors, lands, immunities, wreathes, chaines, ornaments, places in the theater, with diuers other previledges, and laſtly ſtatues and triumphes were appointed for the well deſeruing ſouldiar. And it is to be obſerued, that whereas the Legionarie bands (which were natiues) had ſiluer chaines, the Auxiliarie (which were ſtrangers) had gould chaines to encourage them, and to binde them to the State by benefits, as the others were bownd by naturall loue and duty. But it may be obiected that theſe honors conferd by the Romane Commonwealth were acknowledged by reaſon of the Monarchie, and did extend as vniuerſally, as the Romane command and power it ſelfe, which tutched almoſt the worlds circumference: but it is not ſo with petty Commonweales, whoſe acts ſeeme therefore to be priuate, and to be contained in narrow liſtes. And this is true, nor would I therefore deſire for the wel deſerueing ſouldiar any honor or preuiledge but a publique acknowledgment and reſpect within the Vnited Prouinces or whereſoeuer they haue power or command: this they haue power to confer, as wee ſee the State of Ireland gaue the title of King to H. 8. by act of parliament, who before was written Lord of Ireland only; and what the States could giue would ſufficiently content the ſouldiar, deſirons of honor, and binde them the rather to the place and ſeruice, whilſt they should there haue that due reuerence and acknowledgement,

which in other places they should not finde but vpon remouall looſe. And for ought I ſee the Honors conferd by abſolute Princes, are of force no farther then their owne forces carry them and giue them life and anthority; as wee ſee in the Emperiall Courts, who will not be acknowledged for ſuch in greate Brittaine, and ſurely Sir Robert Dudly, what State or ſtile ſo euer he walkes vnder in Florence, muſt in England, if euer he returne, vaile bonnet, and teturne to his English titles.
            I ſay therefore, had a worthy Commander, after long and good ſeruice, ſome publique acknowledgement of his merrit; ſome title, or note of honor, ſome preuiledge or extraordinarye reſpect and allowance (thought it went no farther then within the limits and command of the vnited Prouinces) yet it would animate and ſtirre vp noble ſpirits to excellent actions and entreprizes through emulation. And had a priuate ſouldiar, after long and good ſeruice, the leaſt acknowledgement of his worth, were it but immunitie from the exciſe, increaſe of meanes, or any other preuiledge it would incourage a poore man to ſerue brauely. But to ſell his flesh and blood, for bread and cheeſe, to ſpend his luſtie youth euen till he ariue at a maymed and ſickly old age, for ſo much meanes as will only keepe ſoule and body togither; in a miſerable manner and (which is worſt of all) if he liues in the wars 20 or 30 yeeres, neuer to haue hope of due and orderly preferment, but to ſee euery youth daunce frog-leape ouer his back, this is that which quencheth the courage of all honorable vndertakeing, and is the only cauſe ſoe little is performed vpon the politique and powerfull Enemy.
            Laſtly I humbly deſire all Readers of both nations high and Low, to pardon me and to accept of my good will

which aymed heerein to do good. Eſpecially I ſeeke pardon of the illuſtrious Lords and Gouernors of this State who may thinke me too peremptorie, plaine, and punctuall, in ſome paſages of diſcourſe, and in the propoſitions I haue made. But when they shall vnderſtand I haue ſuffered for their ſake from mine owne Nation, and haue beene taken and chalenged as a Man too much their owne and partiall vpon their ſide for what I haue done, ſpoken, and written; they will, perhaps the ſooner intertaine my excuſe, and the better beare my plainenes and bouldnes. And for thoſe of myne owne Nation who haue thought me to vilifie our owne and to honor this people too much, I let them know that I haue done nothing but what the truth and the neceſſitie of the caſe required. For when I meete a diſcontented Countriman of mine owne, who ſeekes to eaſe his priuare ſpleene, and to reuenge his particular quarrell, by inuectiues againſt the publique State of theſe Prouinces, then as one that vnderſtands how much it concernes all our welfares (eſpecially for point of Religion) to be well conceited of each other, and to ſtand togither in firme friendship, iealous that many fractures should make the ioynt vnconſolidable, and not knowing with what heart and intent thoſe obiections are made, nor how powerfully that ſcattered breath may worke, (whilſt I ſee thin vapors, gathering and vniteing by degrees, breake out at laſt into boiſterous ſtormes and bluſtering windes) I doe what I can to oppoſe theſe in the beginning, and that perhaps with a little too much violence, contending for the honor of theſe parts.
            But againe when I meete with an obſtinate and malevolent ſpirit of theſe Conntryes, arrogateing all to their

owne worth, ſlighting our King and Kingdome, and ſeemeing to rely vpon other Princes in their opinion more potent: then indignation lets looſe the reynes of my affection, and reaſon accompaines and ſeconds them as farre as she is able, to let ſuch blind Braggadochies diſcerne what they are able to doe for themſelues, what wee haue done for them, and how (whatſoeuer they ſay and would faine make men bleleeue) they cannot rely with that aſſurance vpon any popish Nation, as they may vpon vs, for all our ſeemeing ouerſenes; Nay that there is no Nation vnder the ſunne that can be ſo profitable and helpefull to them as that of greate Brittanie. Which they may eaſely ſee who obſerue the ſituation and shipping of both, and conſider that all France, though farre more potent at Land, could not haue afforded vs equall aſſiſtance to that which theſe Countries, (then weake in compariſon of what they are) brought vs in 88 by Sea. Nor can all France (though they were our ſuperiors in ſtrength, as yet no triall by battell hath giuen them the aſſurance) ſo ſupply their wants and ſecond their warres offenſiue and defenſiue by Land and Sea as wee can doe. Thus incountring with English aduerſaries, I shew my ſelfe a plaine dealeing Dutchman; and incountring the Dutch, I shew my ſelfe what I am, a true hearted English man; But heere where I ſpeake freely I declare impartially what I haue knowne, or heard vpon both parts; what greeuances ought to be remoued, what cautions ought to be obſerued, what diligence ought to be vſed on both ſides, to ſettle and make ſtrong this old league renued, in conſeruation whereof the liberty of both States, yea of all Chriſtendome, yea of Chriſtianity it ſelfe in ſome ſort, conſiſteth. The wrack of Religion is that which is aymed

at, is that which I feare; and were it not for Religion I would ſtudy, and should ſoone finde the way, to be a polititian alſo. Now I haue ſayd nothing with a purpoſe to ouervalue out preſent ayde (I haue ſpoken aſmuch of theirs) or to vpbraide this State with ingratitude, or as a man that grutched at what wee giue and thought it too much (I wish it much more) or as one that imagined the wiſemen of theſe Lands did not ſee all this, and more too, without my light; farre be this folly from me: Nay rather my intention is to let the common man ſee this, who will not vnderſtand it, or at leaſt acknowledge it; That when he ſees the truth, he may make better account of vsthen he vſeth to doe. For I muſt tell them for concluſion, that our Commons & the State generally, for religions ſake principally, is ready to drop their money and their blood freely for this Nation: only the wiſedome of our State holds vs back becauſe they ſee vs too forward, and know well, that what is proffered is contemned, and what is too common, cloyes. Soe all the Remoraes and rubs theſe men finde in their affaires with vs is from this ground. Whereas on the contrary they are the Commons of the vnited Provinces who ſlight our people, doe vs all the wronge at home and abroade, where they can take any aduantage againſt vs, and giue vs and our State all the diſguſts they receiue. This I beleeue proceedes principally from that irreligious or ſuperſtitious mixture, which is amongſt them, who eyther corrupt the reſt that are truly religious and true patriots, or at leaſt, by their multitudes, ſo ouerſway the good, that they cannot doe, for vs and themſelues, as they would. And for this cauſe. Their State and Stateſmen yea the illuſtrious Lordes themſelues are forced by authoritie and

power to reſtraine them from euill, and on their behalfes, to doe vs all the good they can. Soe you may obſerue that with vs the generall currant runns ſtrongly in fauour of theſe Prouinces, particulars only oppoſe it for polecie or perhaps ſome for poperie; but in the vnited Prouinces the generall currant runs ſtrongly againſt vs, and therefore their State or ſome particular perſons of it, ashamed of the common folly, indeauor to mend it. I make a queſtion if this people were in peace as we are, and wee in warre as they are, whether or no their Common people would as willingly and readely offer themſelues and their monyes for vs, and preſſe the States for permiſſion, as wee offer our ſelues and our monyes freely for them, and preſſe our ſuperiors by ſuites, intreaties, and humble petitions, to giue vs leaue to aſſiſt them. I am perſwaded, thoſe that grutch and repine, at the exciſe which is raiſed for their owne inſtant and moſt neceſſarie defenſe, would grutch farre more to doe it for others. But it hath not beene long ſo, their forefathers who with their blood bought their preſent libettie, were of an other minde. And thoſe Popelings, Libertines, and Sectaries amongſt them who are now all ſick for change, would, if the Lord should ſo plague them as to giue them their heartes deſire (which I conſtantly hope, and heartely pray for the ſake of the faithfull which are amongſt them, that he will not) ſoone finde the difference of gouernement; when in ſtead of Fathers, and Brethren, and Sonnes, and Kinsfolke, and a Prince of their owne election, yea ſuch a Prince, ſuch a Generall, as neuer Nation met with a more moderate, affable, prudent, diligent, watchfull, papatient, prouident, and in all reſpects one more fit for them: in ſteade of ſuch, I ſay, they should haue Strangers,

and Tyrants ſet ouer them, who haue shown heretofore, and would shew againe, if they had meanes, that (whatſoeuer we foolishly perſwade our ſelues to the contrarie) they neither reſpect Law, nor Promiſe, nor Oath; nor make difference of Religion, or Sexe, or Perſon; but ſeeke onely ſatisfaction of their Libidinous, Ambitious, Cruell, and Couetous deſires.
            This I thought good briefly to intimate, that, if it be poſſible, we may receiue reciprocall kindneſſe from this Nation generally; and then they need not doubt no more then we our ſelues doe, but that, where his Maieſtie ſends this yeere ſixe thouſand Foot for their ayd, the next yeere (if they should need, as I hope they shall not, pray they may not) a Royall Armie will, in the name of God and our King, command the inſulting and incroching Enemie, to ſtand backe, and giue vp, what he hath vniuſtly ſwallowed, and what he shall neuer digeſt to doe him good, but which may proue as fatall to his entended Monarchy, as that Flesh was to the Eagle, which she ſnatched from the Altar, to the firing of her owne neaſt.
            And this out of queſtion we with them should effect, without reliance vpon other vncertaine Leagues, if we would ſeriouſly vnite our Forces by Land and by Sea, and follow that footing which God hath lately giuen this Nation in the Weſt Indyes. But of this there is little hope whilſt thoſe fatall quarrells in the Eaſt Indyes lye feſtering betwixt vs in blood vnappeaſed, and no ſuch reall ſatiſfaction is giuen, as may witneſſe the impartiall Iuſtice and neceſſitie of the cauſe if true (which with the circumſtances giues great occaſion of ſuſpition) or teſtifie by execution of the delinquents (if they be found to couer trecherie and murther vnder the apparance of Iuſtice) that they

will not hazard the loſle of his Maieſties protection, and our loues, for the liues of a few Libertines; becauſe they loue vs for ſome thing elſe beſides their owne profit, and will shew the world it is not true which their Enemies ſlanderouſly giue out, That they know no God but Gaine, no Religion but Reaſon of State, no Heauen but this preſent World, and no Friend but themſelues. For our parts we shew our ſelues to be Subiects of ſuch a Soueraigne, as loues no mans perſon ſo well to make vs loue or protect his ſinne. If they haue dealt treacherouſly, we diſclaime them for our Countreymen, and can be as well content to ſee them ſuffer worthely, as Pyrates and other offendors who are put to death as publique Enemies to all Nations. But if ours be Innocent, and this cryme be rayſed by policie to ſupplant them from thoſe parts as is ſuggeſted, then we hope and expect a ſeuere example shal be made vpon thoſe Diuels, who to the end they may do euill, and ſatisfie their cruelties (which they exerciſe euer where they are Maſters) doe not forbeare euen to accuſe the Innocent, as Satan did Iuſt Iob. But ſparing to cenſure this on either ſide, till we ſee the cauſe cleared by ſeuere, ſtrickt, and impartiall examination, which we hope for and expect, we pray God to bleſſe and proſper this League of Loue begun, and to conuert or confound all that wish the contrarie.
            FINIS.
