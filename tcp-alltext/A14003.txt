            TO THE RIGHT worſhipfull Maiſter Gabriel Armeſtrong Eſquire, and to the vertuous gentlewoman Miſtris Margaret Armeſtrong his louing Wife.
            
               RIght worſhipful, many, large and admirable are the benefits wherwith the Lord hath honoured vs theſe fifty by-paſt years together. He hath borne vs, as an Eagle doth her Birds vpon his wings,Deut. 32.11 and walled vs in with

his loue. He hath giuen vs his Word, and his Sacraments of grace; he hath ſent vs his Prophets, and Embaſſadours: he hath compaſſed vs with peace and proſperity, making vs to eate the fruites of the fields, and cauſing vs to ſucke hony out of the ſtone,
               Deut. 32.13 
               and oyle out of the rocke. He hath ſet moſt noble Gouernours ouer vs: he hath filled our hearts with the ioyes of victories, & hath put the ſongs of deliuerances into our mouthes.
            But lamentable is the entertainement, which his loue hath found amongſt vs, who (like thoſe ancient Iſraelites) haue corrupted our ſelues towards

him by our vice;Deut. 32.5 15.21. a peruerſe and tortuous generation, who being laden with fatnes, haue ſpurned with our heeles, and prouoked his Highneſſe with our vanities.
            For firſt, if we conſider the tranſcendent profanenes and affected ignorance of the multitude, & the flagitious irregularities of many deſperate Atheiſts, Epicures, Nullifidians, as infeſtant as the frogs of Aegypt,
               Ex. 8, 3.14. which made the land to ſtink; it may be truly ſaid of them (vngratefull wretches) that they caſt the filth of their feet in his face, they recompence his grace with graceleſneſſe,

and preſſe him with their ſins as a Cart with ſheues not Men, but Monſters, which (like Moles) digge groueling in wickednes (as in the ground) and ceaſſe not till they haue caſt vp a Mountaine of hatefull enormities againſt the heauens.
            Secondly, if we call to mind & ſeriouſly perpend that peſtilent and prodigious Powder-plot,
               Nouem. 5. An. 1605. and ſome other execrable and vnnaturall attempts and machinations of ſome of our Italianated Catholiques in ſpeciall, & the incorrigible obſtinacie of them all in generall, (like the Sycamore, which

the more it is moiſtened, the drier it waxeth) it wil appeare impoſſible for thē to purge themſelues of palpable ingratitude and diſloyalty; being aduerſaries to his truth, ſetled vpon the lees of their owne feculent opinions, adoring the Idols of their owne diſtempered braines, polluting his worſhip with ſuperſtitious aditions, and bearing no good will vnto his people.
            Thirdly, if we do well obſerue the prepoſterous & diſaſtrous ſtudies of many ſchiſmaticall and refractarious ſpirits, their heate, their violence,

and vncharitablenes, how vnnaturally they do reiect & reuile their Mother, how paſſionately they doe blaſpheme the Church, which God hath planted with his owne hand, and with what moroſity they haue ab-alienated themſelues from their Bretheren; they can by no pretext acquit themſelues of great vndutifulnes vnto God, being ſo turbulent in his Houſe, ſo diſobedient to their Mother, & ſo farre exorbitant in all their courſes; not much vnlike to mothes, that fret the cloth, wherein they breed; to water-boughes, which hurt the tree,

from which they ſprang.
            And finally for the more hopeful and ingenuous, if we doe but conſider the remiſneſſe of too-too many, the retraits, the ſtandings, the diſtractions, the doubtes, that are too common, too conſpicuous (ariſing partly from the corrupted fountaine of our nature, which is not drained dry till death; and partly proceeding of the vicious enſamples and ſcandalous d
                  •
               meanure of hypocrites & profane extrauagants; and partly alſo through the differences of opinions, and the vnbrotherlike hanging-off and flying off of

many Romaniſts & other Separiſts, al Noueliſts) if theſe things (I ſay) be well conſidered, we cannot but confeſſe that we are behind in duty, and haue not made ſuch vſe of Gods mercies, as wee ſhould haue done.
            What remaineth for vs then to do? Surely we ſhould all repent, all, All without exception. We ſhould examine our ſelues, rectify & ſettle our iudgements, and turne the current of our harts & liues, & ſue for pardon, bewaring that we be not (like Bowles) ouerſwaied with the wrydrawing Byas of our owne conceitednes

and home-bred concupiſence; leſt the Lord being exaſperated againſt vs, our day be turned into darkneſse, our light into night, our fame into ſhame, & ſo be made the ſpectacle of his wrath, and ſcorne of the world.
            
            We are Gods Houſe,
               1. Cor. 3.16. and the Receptacles of his Spirit, which is the author of holineſſe, & the ſource of perfection: we are his Fleld, his Vineyard and Garden of delight; our duty therefore is to cleanſe & adorne our harts to be faire and fruitfull, pleaſing and not offenſiue. The Sunne of righteouſneſſe hath ſhone long amongſt vs with

exceeding brightneſſe (in the Goſpell) and with his heat hath moulten the Cloudes aboue vs, which haue emptied themſelues like bottles vpon vs; and therefore to teſtify our pleaſantneſſe and fertility for the remōſtratiō of our gratitude, we ſhould abound in grace, increaſe in knowledge, and perfume the aire about vs with our fragrant ſauors, and not poiſon it with filthy fumes, like ſtinking dunghils.
            To further this both deſerued and deſired duty, I haue penned, and now am bold to publiſh this Tractate folowing, which I haue preſumed to dedicate
               
and preſent vnto your VVorſhips in this plight you ſee, (partly for that great reſpect, which you haue euer had of Gods faithfull Miniſters) wiſhing it may find but quiet houſe-roome in your hearts, and ſo I ſhall enioy my wiſh, and it no meane reward.
            Now the very God of peace ſanctify you both throughout,1 Theſ. 5.23 and ſo honour you with his grace, that hauing finiſhed your race in this world, you may rest and reigne for euer in the world to come.
            
               London, October 28. 1609.
               
               Your VVorſhips in Chriſt Ieſus, THOMAS TVKE.
               
            
         
         
            
            
            To the godly Reader.
            
               THere are at this day nine ſorts of book-readers to be found amongst vs, & but one of them to be commended.
            The firſt and worſt are they, that reade to ſee, and ſee to carpe and cauil; like the Curre, that takes moſt delight in biting and in baulling; or not vnlike the fleſh-flie, that delighteth alwaies in ſucking bloud, or ſitting on the ſore.
            The ſecond are they, that account more of ſmoake then fire, and of a foming wit, then of ſolide wiſedome, affecting nothing in a manner but nouelties & new conceipts; how rotten, vaine, idle & ſcurrilous they care not,

ſo they feed their fancie, and procure meriment; like the cow, that had rather drinke puddle then pure water.
            The third are they, that will reade things indeed, which may ſtand them in ſome ſlead▪ but they vſe to reade by ſnatches, here and there, euery where and no where; like the Dogges of Nilus, that dranke running, taking here and there a lap as they went: Or if they reade without skipping, it is then with ſuch fury, like Iehues marching, as that they ſwallow downe their bookes without chewing, and ſo let their good digeſting.
            The fourth are they, that preferre the ſhell before the kernel, and the diſh before the meat, regarding the ſound rather then the ſence, & the outward ſhape of the worke more then the inward ſubſtance; as if a man ſhould delight more in the colour then in the corps: and not much vnlike to children, that turne ouer their bookes,

but pleaſe themſelues best with the painted Babies in them.
            A fift kind there are, that reade much, but practiſe nothing; as if a man ſhould take meat into his mouth to pleaſe his taſt, but let none goe downe into his ſtomack to comfort nature. Or if they do practiſe any thing it is worſe then nothing, baſe and ſinfull; like a filthy Chanell, that receiues the ſweet light and heate of the Sunne, but affoords nothing but ſtinking fumes and infectious ſmels.
            The ſixt are they, that had rather reade naturall or humane and ciuill hiſtories, and treatiſes of arts and ſciences liberall and mechanicall, then Eccleſiaſticall and diuine diſcourſes; it ſeemes eſteeming more of the Maide then of the Miſtris, of humanity more then of diuinity, & of the body more then of the ſoule; like Aeſops Cocke, that ſet more by a barly corne, thē by all the gemmes and iewels in the

world beſides.
            The ſeauenth are they, which reade to talke, and talke to ſhew themſelues (and yet we know that empty barrels and the hollow Drums do make the greateſt ſounds) as if they read for nothing but to know to talke, and that by talking they might be knowne; regarding more (it ſeemes) the floating knowledge of the braine, then the ſoundneſſe of the heart and life, and affecting rather to ſeeme to be, then to be indeed; vſually dealing with their bookes as ful-fed children do with their bread, which either play with it, or caſt it to the Dogges. So all their religion is placed in their tong, and their ſubſtance is but ſhews and ſhadowes, like that counterfait of Samuel, and ſtuft vp with wind like a bladder. Though they deuoure whole bookes, yet are they (like Pharoahs kine) as ill fauoured, and as leane & lank for true grace (as by their liues

appeareth) as they were before, and worſe thē many of the heathen, which neuer truly knew what Chriſtian vertue meant.
            There are others, that reade much and profit nothing, but caſt vp their morſels like a crazy ſtomack. They come to the well without their pitchers, or elſe with riuen veſſels, having their thoughts diſtracted, and 
                  •
               heir head fraught with impertinent ſtudies; like Table-bookes, which 
                  •
               eing written ful already, wil receiue 
                  •
               o new letters, till the old be razed 
                  •
               ut in whole, or in part. Or elſe it is becauſe they run on, and neither looke backe, nor minde their way (but onely labour to ridde ground) nor 
                  •
               hew their cadde, nor call on God for 
                  •
               is benigne aſſiſtance; which of all 
                  •
               en ought in all holy enterpriſes to be deſired with earneſt ſuite vpon the 
                  ••
               nces of their ſoules.
            The ninth, which are the onely

good, are they that reade attentiuely, throughly and diſcreetly, to reap ſome good, whereby they may do good to themſelues and other alſo, as occaſion & their calling ſerueth, and to theſe I do propoſe this booke.
            If thou wouldeſt behold the office of Gods Workmē, & the honour which of duty ought to be performed to them: if thou wouldeſt know the reſemblance betwixt the Church and a Field & Houſe: if thou wouldeſt ſee the office and honour of all her children, or wouldeſt learne how thou maist be rich in the fruits of righteouſneſſe, & how to giue the Lord ſuch entertainement, as is well pleaſing to

of the ſimplest, rather then obſcure and curious exactneſſe; euer iudging it better to walke in the open aire, then to run inuiſibly in the clouds, & to leaue ſome milke in the breſts, then to ſucke them dry, or preſſe them till they bleed.

            Amen.

                  waſt.
               
               From hence we are firſt taught, not to deſpaire of Gods mercy, (ſay not that thy ſins are greater then can bee forgiuen,) ſeeing ſo great a ſinner obtained ſo great mercy: for Paul was not onely made a Conuert, but alſo a Conuerter: he was not onely called by Gods grace to bee a partaker of grace himſelfe, but Gal. 1.15.16. 
                  he was alſo called by his grace to be a Preacher of grace vnto others. He was not onely taken out of the wrong way, and ſet in the right, but he was alſo ſet as a Marke in the way to direct and giue ayme to others. Hee was not onely made a Sheep of Chriſt, but alſo a Sheepheard vnder Chriſt to feed and guide his ſheepe. In a word, hee was made a Member and a Miniſter of the Church, not a Plant onely, but a Planter alſo; a Vine and a Vine-dreſſer. Yet we muſt not preſumptuouſly in hope of mercy, either perſecute Gods people: (for they that touch them, Zach. 2.8. 
                  Touch the apple of his eye:) or

addict our ſelues vnto any other knowne enormity: For Paul perſecuted but 1. Tim. 1.13. 
                  Of ignorance, and not of malice, as Iulian: and Dauid (a man of Gods owne moulding) praied that GOD would Pſ. 19.13. 
                  Keepe him from preſumptuous ſinnes. And as wee reade in holy writ, of one notorious Perſecutor, who was conuerted and greatly graced, that no man might deſpaire: ſo againe we reade but of one, that no man might preſume. It is tranſcendent iniquity for any man to ſin in hope of pardon.
               Secondly, we learne to ſuſpend our iudgements of thoſe that now run the race of wickednes, & are led captiue of the Diuell to fulfill his will with greedines. When Paul 
                  1. Tim. 13 Acts. 9.1. blaſphemed, perſecuted and threatned, who could then haue ſaved: who would haue thought that he ſhould euer haue bin ſo changed, as of a Lion to be made a Lambe, of a Scatterer a Gatherer, and of the Diuels limme, Gods faithfull labourer? Quifecit reficere poteſt: He that made them can mend them.

God that formed them, can reforme them. He can turne the ſtreame of their ſinfull affection: He can cleanſe them with the purging water of his Spirit, and caſt the mettall of their ſoules in a new mould. As by the ſtrength of his arme hee brought his people out of Egypt, & ſet thē in their way to Canaan: ſo he can as eaſily (if he pleaſe) bring theſe men forth of ſpirituall Egypt, from ſeruitude vnder ſinne and Sathan, and ſet, yea and ſettle them in the kingdome of grace, the Suburbs & High-way to the kingdome of glory. And who knoweth the ſecret will of God? His councell is vnſearchable and his Rom. 11.33.34. 
                  Waies paſt finding out. Indeede we muſt: deplore their preſent condition; but we may not deſpaire of their future conuerſion. Wee may diſlike and reproue them; but we may not deeme thē

                     es: For Gods Iſ. 50▪2. arme is neuer ſo ſhort that it cannot ſaue, neither can the fountaine of his grace be drained dry. His wil is all, which is conſtant as himſelfe, & knowne only to himſelfe.
            
            
               
               CHAP. 2. Miniſters muſt not contemne one another: ſeuen reaſons are rendred why they ſhould not behaue themſelues proudly and ſcornfully one to another.
               
                  
                     Doct. 2 VVE) Here we ſee that Paul makes Apollos one of Gods helpers or labourers as well as himſelfe; and yet no doubt there was great oddes betwixt them, not only in eminency of place, but alſo in excellency ef grace. Paul was not called Gal. 1.1. 
                  Of men, as falſe Apoſtles are, and vſe to be: nor By men, as ordinary Miniſters are, and ought to be; but by Ieſus Chriſt immediatly to be an Apoſtle, euen a Miniſter in the higheſt calling within the Church, to ſay nothing of his learning, wiſdome, fortitude; conſtancy and other notable endowments, wherein he did excel, as if he had bin the very Center of Gods graces. They therefore, that are any way qualified or aduanced aboue their brethren, muſt beware

they do not di
                     •
                  daine & ſcorne them.
               For firſt, 1. Cor. 4.7 
                  What haſt thou, that thou haſt not receiued? Promotiō 
                  Pſa. 75.6. 
                  commeth neither from the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt, nor from the South, but from God that deiecteth one, and erecteth another. Riches and 1. Chron 29.12. Iob. 32.8. Iam 1.5. honour, wiſdome, learning, and knowledge are of the Lord, who giues and takes according to his will.
               Secondly, Prou. 29.23. Mat. 23.12 Iames. 4.6. 
                  the pride of man ſhall bring him low; but the humble in ſpirit ſhall enioy glory. Whoſoeuer will exalt himſelfe, ſhall be brought low, and whoſoeuer wil humble himſelfe ſhal be exalted: for God reſiſteth the proud, and giueth grace to the humble. And as wee ſee the higheſt hils haue the ſhorteſt graſſe: ſo we ſee that the haughtieſt hearts are the moſt barren of ſauing grace. Pride & piety cannot rule in one houſe, & reign in one kingdome. Neither is it Chriſtian prudence to procure thine owne grace by the diſgrace of thy brother.
               Thirdly, his one talent may increaſe to ten, whereas (it may be) thy two
                  
ſhall not exceede foure, and perhaps waſt away to one. And better is ſmall wine that is freſh & liuely, then ſtronger which is become dead and muſty. Thou maiſt ſtand at a ſtay, as the Ioſh. 10.13. 
                  Sun did in the daies of Ioſhuah, or elſe goe backward as the ſhadow did in the Iſay. 38.8 
                  Dyall of Ahaz; whereas he ſhall increaſe and proceede as the day doth in light and brightnes til it be noone▪ And it is more honor to riſe then fall, and to go on, then to ſtand ſtill, or giue backe.
               Fourthly, pride procures hatred, contention & ſchiſmes, and is an vtter enemy to fraternity, peace and vnity; & he that ſcorns moſt, is ſcorned moſt: for Mat. 7.2 
                  with what meaſure ye meate▪
                   (ſaith Chriſt) it ſhal be meaſured to you againe.
               
               Fifthly, God may bleſſe him in his poore place, and make his one talent more profitable to the Church then thy two: yea then thy ten: for it is 1. Cor. 3.7 
                  God that giueth the increaſe.
               
               Sixthly, humility, meekneſſe and modeſty, are comly & commendable in men of all other callings; therefore

the holy Ghoſt ſaith: 1. Pet. 5.5 
                  Submit your ſelues euery man, one vnto another▪ decke your ſelues inwardly with lowlineſſe of minde. Much more then in Gods Miniſters, who ought to be (as Peter ſpeaketh) 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   
                  Patternes to the people (not onely facienda docentes, but alſo docenda facientes) & as bookes for them to read their leſſons in; like that ſtarre which went before thoſe Matth. 2. 
                  Wiſe men, and conducted them to the place where Chriſt was layed.
               Laſtly, they are the Miniſters and Adiutors of God, as well as thou that haſt greater ornaments, whether in reſpect of gifts or of glory. Siluer is mettall as well as gold: & the poore man may be as true a ſubiect as the rich: And if all good miniſters haue one Lord, and work in one building, though they haue not one ſtanding, and the ſame meaſure of skill, what reaſon is there that one ſhould maligne and vilipend an other? Paule forbade the 1. C

                  Corinthes to deſpiſe Timotheus, becauſe hee wrought the worke of the Lord, as hee himſelfe

did. This reaſon therefore ſhould ſway with thoſe that are Miniſters themſelues, and ſtay them from inſulting ouer one onother, as if they were not fellow-labourers, and brethren in one office, becauſe of ſome diuerſity of place, or inequality of gifts. The Sunne excelleth the Moone in glory: yet both are ſtarres, and one contemneth not another. The talleſt Cedar will ſuffer the loweſt Shrub to grow by it without diſdaine. Hee that receiued Mat. 25. 
                  Fiue talents did not cō
                  temne him that had but two▪ but one. The foot is a part of the body as well as the face, though not ſo faire: & the hands as well as the head, though not ſo comely, or as the heart, though not ſo worthy; yet they haue their vſe, & there is no contempt betwixt them. The eye is more excellent then the eare, and the eare more commodious them the eye, yet they ſtand both in one head without the leaſt diſdaine or enuy. And the ſtrings of an Inſtrument, though differing in ſound and quantity, are neuertheleſſe

all of them ſtrings▪ and can agree well together. So, euen ſo, though thou ſurpaſſe thy brother, yet deſpiſe him not, diſdaine him not, prouoke him not, but rather Gal. 5.13.26. 
                  ſerue him, by loue: for he is Gods labourer as well as thy ſelfe, hee workes vnder God, by God & for God, in his Field

                  nd building as well as thou that art of parts more excellent, or in place more eminent.
            
            
               CHAP. 3. God hath ordained that man ſhould teach man, the reaſon hereof is fourefold.

                   his Temple. Vs hee hath ſelected and called to helpe forward

his Harueſt, and to ſerue him in the building, purging, poliſhing, and repairing of his houſe. Whence wee learne theſe two leſſons. Firſt▪ wee ſee that it pleaſeth GOD, that man ſhould inſtruct man, and that his Church (which is his Tabernacle, and Garden of delight) ſhould bee built and husbanded by men. As in the naturall body one member helpeth another: and as in the politicall body, one man ouerſeeth and gouerneth an other: ſo in the ſpiritual & Eccleſiaſtical body, God hath wiſely ordayned that ſome of the members ſhould direct, relieue, inſtruct and nouriſh the reſt, prouided alwayes, that they ſubiect themſelues vnto their King Chriſt Ieſus, that they gouerne by his Lawes, and by the Scepter of his word, and feede them with foode prepared out of it; and not with the dregges and drugges of mans inuention, which may be ſweete ſometimes in the mouth, but are alwaies bitter in the maw, hurtfull vnto

the ſoule, as pilles of poyſon are vnto the body though drenched in ſugar.
               Now the Lord hath thus ordeyned: Firſt becauſe we are weake and timerous, vnable to beare the maieſty of his voyce, and the glory of his preſence. When the Iſraelites had ſeene and heard thoſe maieſticall things, (but terrible to fleſh & bloud) which were ſhewed at the promulgation of the Law. Exod. 20.18.19. 
                  They fled, & ſtood a farre off, and ſaid vnto Moſes: Speake thou to vs, and we will heare; but let not God ſpeake vnto vs leaſt we dye. They were men as well as we, and we are the ſonnes of men as wel as they. Some of them, as ſome of vs, were good, and ſome bad: yet all were afraid, all fled; the good as well as the bad came to Moſes, that God might ſpeake no more vnto them.
               Secondly, God hath appointed this order for the manifeſtation and tryall of our obedience, as hee proued the faith of Gen. 22.1. 
                  Abraham, by commanding him to ſacrifice his Sonne

                  Iſaack: ſo he proueth our obedience and humility in commanding vs to heare men like ourſelues, (or perhaps inferiour) and to ſtoope vnto their miniſtery, as to himſelfe. And as hee ſaid vnto Abraham: 
                  Gen. 22.12. 
                  Now I know that thou feareſt God, ſeeing for my ſake thou haſt not ſpared thine onely ſonne. So may he ſay to vs, if we ſhew our ſelues obedient to his ordinance; Now I know that ye feare my name: yea rather we may aſſure our ſelues that wee doe t
                     •
                  uly feare and obey God, if we doe from our hearts ſubmit our ſelues to this order, and liſten to the voyce of his Prophets attentiuly, as Act. 16.14. 
                  Lydia, and with that Luk. 8.15. 
                  Honeſt and good heart, which none enioy, none can poſſeſſe but good Hearers, and Gods faithfull Obedientaries.
               
               Thirdly, God hath thus diſpoſed that he might teſtifie his Philanthropy and good will towards his Miniſters, in conſecrating their mouthes and tonges (being but ſinfull and ſilly wretches) vnto himſelfe, ſo as that his voice ſhall ſound in them, and his

Spirit worke by them to the founding and erecting of his owne kingdome, and to the confounding and ruinating of the Diuels.
               Laſtly, 2. Cor. 4.7. 
                  We haue this treaſure in earthen Veſſels, that the excellēcy of that power might bee of God, and not of vs. Seeing we are called and conuerted by ſinfull, mortall, and meane men, we are now ſtayed from aſcribing the glory of our conuerſion to man, and taught to confeſſe that the Rom. 1.16 
                  Goſpell is the power of God (and not of man) to ſaluation; whom it hath pleaſed by the 1. Cor. 1.21. 
                  fooliſhnes of preaching to ſaue them that beleeue Therefore we muſt not with the Swenchfeldians expect ſecret reuelations of the ſpirit: neither muſt we looke that either God or an Angell ſhould preach vnto vs; but we muſt be content to heare his voice in man, and to obey his Goſpell ſincerely preached by man; which is ſo certaine as that we may not Gal. 1.8. belieue an Angell preaching a Goſpell diuerſe or contrary to it.
               Secondly, we ſee the wonderfull

wiſdome of God, who chooſeth the 1. Cor. 1.21. 
                  Fooliſh, weake and vile things of the world to confound the wiſe, mighty and magnificent: and we ſee plainely that God beſtowes not his greateſt offices alwaies vpon the greateſt p
                     •
                  rſonages: neither doth he (as worldly Princes vſe to do) appoint the mightieſt & wiſeſt men for worldly might and wiſedome, to attempt & atchieue his hard and weighty workes. Hee tooke Dauid from the Pſ. 68.70 
                  ſheepfold, and changed his ſhepheards ſtaffe into a kingly Scepter. He tooke Amos from the Amos. 7.15. 
                  flocke, and made him his Prophet. He made Mat 4 19. 
                  Peter and Andrew of Fiſhermen to become fiſhers of men. Paul ſaith that he and his 1. Cor. 4.9.13. 
                  Fellow-Apoſtles were the gazing ſtocke of the world, and as Filth and Ofskouring; yet were they the Lords 2. Cor. 5 20. 
                  Embaſſadours: God had choſen them to be his Labourers, and had ſet them about an honorable and weighty peece of ſeruice: he had 2. Cor. 5.18. 
                  giuen them the word of Reconciliation, he ſet them to plant his Church, to ſupplant the Synagogue

of Sathan, to collect the diſperſed ſheep of Chriſt, to diſpell the Wolues which ſought to kill them, and to ſaue them from the Foxes which did annoy them.

It is good for all men, for all Miniſters, eſpecially in good things, to be alwaies in the Preſent tenſe. The loue of our calling muſt not vaniſh like a leame of lightning, Our zeale of Gods Houſe muſt not bee like the Morning deaw. It is no praiſe to ſay wee haue beene Gods Labourers, and not to be ſo now, through the peruerſenes of our ſpirits, or the witching inticemēts of the world. The world muſt not draw vs from our calling, as it did 2. Tim. 4.10. 
                  Demas from Paul. The footſtoole muſt not

be ſet vpon the head. We may not worſhip Mammon, and bend our knees vnto the world. Gods Temple may not be forſaken for her Tent, neither muſt we be ſo wedded to our wils, and ſo farre in loue with our luxurious humours, as that wee will rather go out of the field, and leaue our colours, and forſake our warfare, then we will endure to be let bloud, & tied to good orders. It is an excellent thing to be able to ſay with Paul truly; We are Gods Adiutors: We are now Gods Workemen: we are in Gods ſeruice: we labour for him in his field and Temple. He therefore is to bee condemned, whoſoeuer he be, that ſhall forſake this ſo holy and ſo worthy a calling, for the painefulneſſe of it, or for that it is not in this baſe age of the world ſo duly regarded, as in conſcience and common reaſon it ought to be: or for that the world with her amorous dart, hath ſtrucke through his liuer, & wounded him with her loue; what pretext ſoeuer he ſhall make for himſelfe. In like maner alſo thoſe are

to be reproued, that ſhall ſuffer themſelues to be tranſported with the impoſtures of hereticall and ſchiſmaticall Spirits, or ſhall ſooth vp themſelues in their own conceits ſo, as that rather thē they wil alter their courſes, and be diuorced from them, they will leaue Gods field, and forſake his plough they held, & giue ouer building in his Houſe, to which they were called by him. Lamentable is the practiſe of too many, that hauing bin entertained into GODS Houſe for workmen, do lay downe their tooles, and fall to play, to pleaſure, and ayme at nothing more, then at their priuate profits. There are many that will labour hard, till they haue hit the mark they ſhot at; but then they lift vp the heele, they tread the furrowes at their leyſures, and giue themſelues to eaſe and idleneſſe. Others there are, that either through diſcontentedneſſe by reaſon of their contempt and pouerty, or through their ambition and arrogant ouerweening of themſelues, or elſe by reaſon of their ſpiritual lunacy

and affectation of innouation, or through want of fortitude and diſcretion to confront with, and to ſtand vndaunted at the ſcandales, and enormities of the time, or elſe by reaſon of their prepoſterous zeale, irreſolute diſpoſion, coueteous inclination, or vngrounded deuotion, doe leaue the ſcaffold, forſake their ſtation, caſt off their burthen, giue ouer their charge, and either follow that Babiloniſh harlot, or worſhip the fanſies of their owne conceiuing. Me thinks it is ſtrange that a man ſhould leaue the ſeruice of a Virgin, to ſerue an Harlot, and change Ieruſalem for Babilon, Canaan for Aegipt: or that any man ſhould forſake a Vineyard planted with noble Vines, becauſe many noyſome weeds do grow, too boldly with them. But the horſe doth often caſt the rider. The ſun is darke to a blinde man. Some make their luſt the rule of reaſon. And ſome for want of iudgement, can put no difference betwixt place and perſon, betwixt an whoriſh garment, and a garment

as an Whore hath vſurped or got on; as if a Virgin ſhould therefore caſt her coate away, becauſe a Strumpet hath got the like. But wiſdome will be iuſtified of her children. The wiſe will diſcerne betweene a diſeaſe and death, betweene a bleare eye and a blind, betweene a Citty and her walles, a face and her freckles. It is a leaud ſonne that wil deny his mother for her clothes, and an ill ſeruant that will forſake the loyall and chaſt wife of his maiſter, to follow one that is diuorced from him for adultery. It is no wiſedome for thee to contemn the houſe in which thou firſt drew breath becauſe it is not couered or glazed to thy minde, and no good dealing for thee to diſcharge thy ſelfe of that charge, which God hath charged thee withall; to neglect or leaue thy place, thy calling, whether it bee through the loue of the world, the drowſineſſe of thy ſluggiſh nature, or the pertinacious entertainement of thine owne nouell conceits. If thou haſt euer beene Gods workman, be

ſo ſtill, and that not in title onely, but in truth: let all be able to ſay with S. Paul: we are Gods Adiutors. Better it is, not to haue beene ſuch, but now to be, then to haue beene, but not now to be, through our owne default.

                     Doct. 5
                  VVE are Labourers together) If Laborers together, then Labourers: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , then 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , if coworkers, then workers. But what? not imperant, but obſequent: not maiſters ſimply, but ſimply miniſters, not equal to God, but ſeruāts of God. God is the only abſolute Architect, and they are his ſelected inſtrumēts; not phyſicall & life-leſſe, but vocal, voluntary, & liuing. Hence we learne that Gods faithfull Miniſters are Labourers not Loyterers. The calling of a Miniſter, is a calling of labour, and not of lazineſſe; therefore the Apoſtle ſaith 1. Tim. 3.1. 
                  He that deſireth the office of a Biſhop, deſireth a worthy work.
                  
The office of a Miniſter is (Tam onus, quam honos) not more honorable then painefull, exacting diligence as well as affoording dignity. Beneficium poſtulat officium, a benefice requires a duty. He that hath his liuing from the Church, & labors not for the Church, is a robber of the Church. The property of a workman is (operari, non ociari) to labour, and not to loyter. The Miniſter is a workman, God hath hired him to worke in his Vineyard. He muſt hold the keyes of his kingdome in one hand, & the Eph. 6.17 ſword of the ſpirit, (which is the word of God) in the other hand; and all are heauy, all are weighty, and hard to weild aright. He muſt help to beare the Church, as the 1. Chron. 15.2. 
                  Leuites did the Arke. Gouernement is laid vpon his ſhoulders, and the ſoules of men are cōmitted to his charge. If any vnder him do Ezeck. 3.20. periſh by him, God will require their bloud at his hands.

Firſt, a Lawfull calling: for it is againſt all right and reaſon, that any man ſhould gather his neighbors grapes, or thruſt his ſickle into his corne without his leaue: and ſo it is as vniuſt for any man to preſume to labour in Gods Vineyard, to build in his Temple, or to worke in his Harueſt, without his leaue and liking. Who dare draw his ſword and ſmite, who dare meddle with his keyes, to open or ſhut miniſterially without his licence? Who dare ſit in Moſes his chaire, vnleſſe he haue ſet him in it, and put his Law-booke into his hands to vnclaſpe and explicate it vnto his people? The labourers in the parable wrought not in the Mat. 20. 
                  Vineyard till the Lord thereof had ſet them on worke. b 
                  Vzzah was ſlaine becauſe he laid his hand vpon the Arke without a calling. Noah
                  
medled not in the building of the Arke, till God had giuen him direction: neither did the Carpenters enter vpon that worke without vocation and approbation from Noah: & they which built the Temple, had licence & command firſt from Salomon, who had his warrant alſo from aboue. Wherefore then ſhould any meddle with the building of the Church, which is Gods Arke and Temple, without ſufficient authority, either immediately from God, or mediatly from thoſe that haue commiſſion from him to proue and admit men to labour for him? Heb. 5.4. 
                  No man taketh this honour vpon him, but he that is called of God, as Aaron was. Chriſt ſheweth that it of right belongeth to the Lord of the Harueſt, to chuſe and appoint Labourers, in that he bids his Diſciples Luk. 10.2. 
                  pray the Lord of the harueſt, to ſend forth Laborers into his Harueſt. For how dare men cut downe, or bind vp, & bring in without his bidding and authorizing? Rom. 10.15. 
                  How ſhall they preach except they be ſent? The Lord complaineth

of ſome Prophets, that Ier. 23.21 
                  ran vnſent, & prophecied vnſpoken to by him. Aaron, and his ſonnes, were ordayned by God to aſſigne the Num. 4.19. 
                  Koathites euery one to his office & to his charge: ſo God hath ordained the Gouernors of the Church to cal & conſecrate Miniſters, and to ſet them to their worke. It is an Anabaptiſtique conceit to think that any man of learning may preach without Eccleſiaſticall ordination, vpon his owne priuate motion or voluntary pleaſure. The glory of God, the honour of the Miniſtery, the ſecurity and ſolace of their conſciences, and that the people may know that they haue lawfull Miniſters, & may thereby be moued to obay their miniſtery: all theſe claime a calling, & argue the neceſſity of lawfull ordination.
            
            
               CHAP. 7. Miniſters muſt be wiſe: their doctrine pure, and their life vpright.
               SEcondly, a workeman muſt bee wiſe, that he may behaue himſelfe

without offence.Miniſters muſt 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Diſcretion is required in a Miniſter, that hee may pleaſe his maiſter, that he may be an example to his fellowes, that he may leade his life without offence to any, and ſo gaine credit to his place and perſon. It is meete therefore, that his doctrine ſhould be pure, and not parti-coloured, and that his conuerſation be correſpondent: & ſo he ſhall ſhew himſelfe truly wiſe, euen godly wiſe. Paul writing to Timothie, ſaith: 2. Tim. 2.15. 
                  Study to ſhew thy ſelfe approued vnto God, a workman that need not be aſhamed, diuiding the word of God aright. And to the Corinthians, he ſaith of himſelfe and of his fellowes, We 
                  2. Cor. 4.2. 
                  haue caſt from vs the cloakes of ſhame, and walke not in craftines, neither handle we the word of God deceiptfully; but in declaration of the truth, we approue our ſelues to euery mans conſcience in the ſight of God. 
                  2. Cor. 1.12. 
                  Our reioycing is this: the teſtimony of our conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly purenes, & not in fleſhly wiſedome, but by the grace of God we haue had our cōuerſation in the world, & moſt of all to youwards.
                  
                  2. Cor. 2.17. 
                  For we are not as many, which make merchandiſe of the word of God: but as of ſincerity, but as of God in the ſight of God ſpeake we in Chriſt. 
                  2. Cor. 6.3. 
                  We giue no occaſion of offence in any thing, that our Miniſtery ſhould not be reprehended: but in all things we approue our ſelues as the miniſters of God, In like manner, he willeth his ſonne Timothy to keep the 
                  2. Tim. 1.13. 
                  true patterne of the wholeſome words which he had heard of him, and to flye from the luſts of youth, 
                  2. Tim. 2.22. 
                  and follow after righteouſnes, faith, loue, and peace: & ſheweth that euery Biſhop muſt be 
                  1. Tim. 3.2.3. 
                  vnreproueable, temperate and modeſt. Miniſters (ſaith Proſper) muſt not onely inſtruct the people with the example of a good life, but ſhould alſo ſhew them by preaching boldly, both the penalty which abides the rebellious, and the glory which belongs to the obedient. The Doctor of the Church (ſaith Chryoſtome) by teaching and liuing well,In Mat. 25. teacheth the people how to liue well: but by liuing wickedly, teacheth God how to condemne him. Aaron was appointed to weare Thummim on his breſt-plate

vpon his heart, and Exod. 28.30.36. a plate of pure gold vpon his forehead, whereon was grauen, Holineſſe to the Lord. So euery Miniſter ſhould haue the Thummim of an vpright heart, & carry the goldē plate before him of an holy life.
               The Arke was commaunded to be Gen. 6.14 pitched within and without with pitch: ſo ſhould euery miniſter be pitched with grace on the inſide of his heart, and on the outſide of his life; and ſo he ſhal be better armed, againſt wind and water. The Snuffers of the candleſtick for the Exod. 35.38. 
                  Tabernacle, were cōmaunded to be made of pure gold: thoſe that ſnuffe others ſhould be pure themſelues. Turpe eſt doctori, cum culpa redarguit ipſum: It is a ſhame for a man to correct another, and not to direct himſelfe, or to weed his neighbours corne, and to ſuffer the weeds to choke his owne. It is a ſhame for a Phiſitian, to proffer Phiſick to others, and yet to ſee and ſuffer himſelfe to rot with diſeaſes. Phiſitian firſt cure thy ſelfe. Pluck Mat. 7.5 forth thine Owne moat, thine Owne beame firſt. He that

admoniſheth another of that, wherein himſelfe remaineth wilfully faulty, doth giue him the cleare wine, and keepeth the dregs to himſelfe; reſembling a Diall or Watch, which profit others by ſhewing how the day paſſeth, but themſelues nothing at all. They which teach wel, and liue wickedly, confute their doctrine with their deedes, and condemne their practiſe by their preaching, and ſo make them ſelues abhominable to God and man. For vnto the wicked God ſaith:Pſ. 50.16.17. 
                  What haſt thou to doe to declare mine ordinances, that thou ſhouldeſt take my couenant into thy mouth, ſeeing thou hateſt to be reformed, and haſt caſt my words behind thee? And ſpeaking to ſome corrupt and vngodly Prieſts, he ſaith; Therefore 
                  Mal. 2.9. 
                  haue I alſo made you to be deſpiſed, and vile before all the people, becauſe yee kept not my waies, but haue been partiall in the Law. A good Reu. 3.1. preacher liuing lewdly, may haue the name of life, as the Angel of the church at Sardis had, yet he is dead in himſelfe. He may by Gods bleſſing benefite another, but he

is his owne bane; like a poſt ſet in the way, which rots it ſelfe, whiles it ſtands to direct others. Let vs therefore looke well to our ſelues.
               The Exod. 27.20. lamps of the Tabernacle were to burne alwaies, and therefore God commaunded, that their oyle ſhould be pure oliue beaten. Miniſters are, or ought to be Lamps to the people; therefore that they may ſhine alway to giue them light, their oile muſt bee pure, they muſt ſtriue to be perfect. Pſ. 93.5. Iſay. 52.11. 
                  Holineſſe becommeth Gods Houſe for euer. Be ye cleane, that beare the veſſels of the Lord. Be holy like your Maiſter. Pſ. 25.14 For he reuealeth his ſecrets to thē that feare him, and walke before him. The weights and meaſures of the Sanctuary were twise as big as the other: ſo the vertues of the Miniſters of the Sā
                  tuary, ſhould much exceed other mens. They ought to be Glaſſes, to admit and tranſmit the Sun-beames of Gods graces; therefore they ſhould be bright and cleere. The Stars are free from elementary corruption. Miniſters are as Stars to giue light vnto

the ſons of men; let them therefore be free from worldly pollution. They labour to preſent the Church a pure Virgine vnto Chriſt her Husband: let them therefore labour againſt impurity in themſelues. Gregory Biſhop of Niſſe ſaith of Baſill the great, that he deſired▪ 
                  (Per puritatem appropinquare Deo) to draw neare to God by purity. It is ſayd of Bucer that he brought all men into ſuch admiration of him, that neither his friends could ſufficiently praiſe him, nor his enemies in any point, find fault with his ſingular life and ſincere doctrine. A godly life and good doctrine, ſhould be wedded, without diuorce in euery miniſter. Mar. 10.

                  Altar continually, and neuer let it goe cut. So we that are Miniſters, ſhould keepe the fire of Gods graces, continually burning vpon the Altar of our hearts within vs, and the lamp of a vertuous life ſhining alway without vs, that men may ſee our good workes, and

glorifie our father in heauen. A licentious life robs the tongue of her liberty, and diſgraceth the Teacher; but an honeſt hart accompanied with a religious life doth commend the owner, and makes him bold, as a Lion, and vndanted in deliuering the tru

bright beames of the Sun, & as a faire and fruitfull Oliue tree. They ſhould ſhine and gliſter in Gods Temple, and ſhew themſelues liue oliues, fruitfull in good workes, & godly exhortations. Sincere doctrine and vertuous conuerſation are as two ſhoulders or Pillars▪
                   whereby they are to beare vp Gods Church, Gods Arke. He which preacheth ſoundly, and conuerſeth looſely (coetum aedificat voc

An euill Paſtor (ſaith Auguſtine) deſtroyeth as much with his wicked conuerſation, as he buildeth with his doctrine. On the contrary, a godly life is a good ſermon, though not vocall, yet viſible and reall. Herod reuerenced Iohn Baptiſt, becauſe he was a Mar. 6.20. 
                  good man, not becauſe hee was a good Miniſter. The people reſpect the life more thē preaching: & thinke it better to do & ſay not, then to ſay and do not. Therfore the Apoſtle wiſely exhorteth Timothy to ſhew himſelfe 1. Tim. 4.1

A bad Diſciple ſeldome makes a good Doctor. He that doth not inſtruct himſelfe is vnmeete and vnworthy to inſtruct others.

Miniſters are Gods Nurſes: but if their breaſts bee drie, how ſhall his children thriue, that are committed to them: Ieremy writeth of a calamity, which befell the Iſraelites, wherein the

                  Meſſengers; therefore they ſhould haue knowledge to deliuer their meſſage diſcreetly. They are ſeers and ouer-ſeers; therefore they ſhould haue eyes to ſee and ouer-ſee. They ſhould be able to diſcerne betweene vice and vertue, betweene light and darkneſſe, betweene truth and falſhood, betweene Sarah and Hagar, betweene a Iudas and a Ionathan, leſt they take the one for the other, as Ixion did the cloude for Iuno. And if the Mat. 15.14. blinde doe leade the blinde, both of them are like to

fall into the ditch. Thoſe miniſters then that cannot teach the people in ſome competent manner, are too defectiue; not much vnlike a cypher, which fils a place, and increaſeth the number, but ſignifies nothing: and ſomething like to Players, which do ſometimes repreſent the perſons of Princes, but are not ſo themſelues.

                  Take heed (ſaith he) to all the

flocke, whereof the holy Ghoſt hath made you ouerſeers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with that his bloud.
               
               Firſt, let vs conſider that wee are the Miniſters, not of man, but of God omnipotent, who will kindly reward all that come vnto him, and labour for him with an honeſt heart, & a good intention, 1. Pet. 5.4.
               Secondly, let vs alſo remember that we did not thruſt our ſelues into his ſeruice, but that he choſe and called vs; and therefore our labours are not arbitrary, but at his diſpoſement and diſpenſation. Thirdly, we are not called to liue in idleneſſe, but to attend, to ouerſee and feed.
               Fourthly, our labours are not ſpent vpon beaſts, but vpon men like our ſelues, and not about earthly things, but heauenly. Fiftly, our paines belong properly & principally to Gods Epheſ. 4 12. 
                  owne people, euen vnto ſuch as his Sonne hath redeemed with his owne bloud, his beſt bloud, his hart-bloud.1. Pet. 5.2. If Iacob was conſumed in the day

with heat,Gen. 31.40. & with froſt in the night; if hee endured ſuch hardneſſe for Sheepe, for beaſts, yea for his Father in lawes ſheepe; ſhall wee take no paines for men? Shall we neglect the Sheepe of Chriſt Ieſus? Shall we beſtow no paines vpon the people of God, who is our moſt gracious father, and more tender hearted then our naturall fathers are, or can be to vs?
               Sixtly, we ſhould conſider, that theſe about whome we labour, are ſubiect to many dangers. Satan & his Angels, the world & their owne corruptions are all of them mortall and moſt pernicious enemies vnto their ſoules. And our labours are through the operation of the Spirit very helpfull and commodious both to preſerue them from euill, and to conſerue and ſtrengthen them in that which is good, yea and to pull them out of the iawes of the Diuell, and out of the briars of wickedneſſe. And therefore we ſhould take the greater paines, and thinke no time nor trauell

miſpent, which we ſhall ſpend this wa

                  .
               Seauenthly, we preach againſt the idleneſſe of men in all other callings, and that not without good cauſe: for it was Ezek. 16.49. one of the ſinnes of Sodome, & is vnprofitable to all ſtates. Wherefore we ought in no caſe addict our ſelues to ſo baſe a ſinne. For otherwiſe we ſhall weaken our owne credits, and expoſe our ſelues to ſhame and obloquy. A blacke ſpot is ſoone eſpied in white paper: Miniſters are much marked: and few trauellers there are, if any at all, which would not haue their waies as faire as their Neighbors. Moreouer, the Scripture calleth vs Paſtors. But Paſtors muſt Paſtoris eſt paſcere, n

                     n deglubere. feed their ſheepe, and not forſake, nor flea them, nor ſtarue them through indiligence and oſcitancy. The flocke muſt be more regarded then the fleece. Paule ſought 2. Cor. 12 14. 
                  them, and not theirs: the men, and not the money. And, 1 Cor. 9.17 
                  Woe vnto me (ſaith he) if I preach not the Goſpell. He was exceeding 2. Cor. 11.23. 
                  toyleſome in his

Miniſtery, in labours abundant. Iude ſaith, that he gaue Iude. 3. 
                  All diligence to write of the commune ſaluation. The Reu. 2.2. 
                  Angell of the Church of Epheſus was by Chriſt commended for his workes and labour. The ancient Prophets, & thoſe worthy men of God, which he raiſed vp for the reuealing of that man of ſinne, and the reſtoration of the truth, as Luther, Zuinglius, Oecolampadius, Bucer, Caluin, Martyr, Iewell, &c. were exceeding diligent and laborious. It is ſayd of that bleſſed Martyr of God Maiſter Bradford, that he preached the time, that he remained priſoner in the Counter twiſe a day continually, except ſickneſſe hindered him.
               Being therefore compaſſed and couered with ſuch a cloude of painefull Miniſters, let vs breake through all obſtacles, and runne the race of our glorious calling, performing whatſoeuer doth appertaine vnto vs with all patience, diligence, and fidelity. All, euen all is little inough, and too little. Honor is ſet before vs: the

                  Speare of vengeance is ſhaken at vs: the Cannon of Gods wrath is planted againſt vs: the Conſtitutions of the Church doe call vpon vs: the Commandement of the great God doth vrge vs: and the holy Scriptures do ſpurre vs to the quicke, and affoord many firme and inuincible arguments to prouoke and perſwade vs to the vigilant, faithfull, and laborious execution of our office; Let vs therefore reſpect and tend it, and behaue our ſelues like Labourers, that need not be aſhamed.

                  corne (which is the foode of the body) the people will curſe him; and ſhall we thinke that he can eſcape a curſe, which refuſeth to preach, and ſo with-holdeth the corne and the foode, wherewith the ſoule ſhould be ſed? But as bleſſing ſhall be vpon his head, that ſelleth corne: ſo he that preacheth the word of trueth, and bringeth foorth like a good Steward, both new and olde out of his treaſure vnto the people,

and breaketh vnto them that bread, that doth relieue the hungry ſoule (if he do it with care and conſcience, and with a purpoſe to glorifie God and to benefit his Church) he ſhall without doubt receiue a bleſſing both from God and Man. The Lord from heauen ſhall bleſſe him, and his people ſhall applaude and laud him. And as Pro. 27.18. 
                  Salomon ſaith that the ſeruant which waiteth vpon his Maiſter, ſhall come to honour: euen ſo ſurely they, which attend vpon their Miniſtery, ſhall be aduanced. They ſhall haue honour in the hearts of the people. And if God ſee them fit for further honour, they ſhall not want it. Let them therefore be watchfull and induſtrious. And indeed, there is no time ſince the light of the Goſpell brake out vnto vs, wherein greater diligence and fidelity is required at the hands of all Gods Miniſters, then now. For Probitas laudatur, & alget: vertue is commended in word, but contemned in deed. Learning is little reſpected: Vice flouriſheth,

wickedneſſe increaſeth: Papiſme ſprouteth afreſh: Atheiſts and Epicures ſwarme like the Exod. 8.24. 
                  flies of Egypt: and of 
                  Act. 20.30. 
                  our owne ſelues do many men ariſe ſpeaking peruerſe things, to drawe diſciples after them; being ready to ſay with thoſe in Eſay; Iſa. 65.5. 
                  Stand aloofe, come not neare me: for I am more holie then thou; being ſelfe-conceited, and diſtracted with phantaſtick queſtions, and impertinent affaires, and poſſeſt with an erroneous, turbulent, vnſtable and blind ſpirit; leauing Ieruſalem in ſtead of Babel, euen their mother that brought them forth & bare them; becauſe, they ſay, ſhe is clad with a Babyloniſh garment, and not with one of their ſpinning. Wherefore greater diligence and attendance ſhould bee giuen, leaſt Gods houſe be fired ouer our heads, leaſt his plants be ſpoyled, leaſt his vines be broken downe, leaſt his flowers be rooted vp, and his garden be defaced and ouergrowne with weedes. For howſoeuer Atheiſts, Papiſts, and Schiſmatiques be looſe in their heads,

yet are they tied faſt together by the tailes (like Iudg. 15 4. 
                  Samſons foxes) with a fire-brand of miſchiefe in the middeſt to ſpoile and burne vp Gods corne, and to ſet fire on his rickes, if they be not with great care and labour preuented.
               
                  Note.But yet, though euery Paſtor muſt be painefull, it doth not therefore follow that they ſhould all be equall in paines. For there are diuerſity of gifts, variety of ages, diſtinction of places, and difference of ſtrength and ableneſſe. But if they doe that, which is fit for them, and which God claimes of them; if there be 2. Cor. 8.12. 
                  a willing mind to performe that, which they can, it is accepted with him, who accounteth the good wil for the worke it ſelfe. Neither is all labour the ſame labour. There is hand-labour as well as lip-labour. And he, that ſitteth at the helme, may labour as wel
                     •
                   as he that is vpon the hatches. But let no man flatter himſelfe. For Gal. 6.7. 
                  God is not (neither wil be) mocked. He Ier. 17.10. 
                  ſearcheth the heart, and recompenſeth euery

man according to his workes. Thou doſt but dance in a net, and delude thy ſelfe. His eyes are neuer ſhut, and Heb. 4.13 
                  all things are naked before them. There is not a Iob 42.2, thought hid from his knowledge. Fig-leaues, friuolous & feigned excuſes, ſubtill and ſophiſticall euaſions cannot ſerue thy turne, they cannot couer thee. He will find thee out: and Heb. 10.31. 
                  it is a fearfull thing to fall into his hands.
               
            
            
               CHAP. 10. Miniſters muſt be cheerfull in diſcharging their office.
               
                  FIftly, a Labourer ſhould be cheerefull and alacrious in his buſineſſe, delighting to ſee his worke go forward. And this alacrity muſt be in all Gods Miniſters. 2. Cor. 9.7. 
                  God loueth a cheerefull giuer: euen ſo likewiſe he loueth a cheerefull workman. Men muſt not giue their almes grudgingly or of neceſſity: ſo Miniſters ſhold not grudge the Lord of their labours, but be

free of them. Chriſt dyed freely for his ſheep, without the leaſt conſtraint; why then ſhould not his Miniſters feede them freely without compulſion or grudging? To feede them is farre leſſe then to dye for them. Dauid and his ſubiects offered 1 Chron. 29.6.9. 
                  willingly to the building of a materiall Temple for the Lord; why then ſhould not we labour willingly, that he may haue a ſpirituall Temple to dwell in? yea by how much the ſpirituall is more excellent thē the material, euen ſo much more willingly we ought to labor that the building therof may go forward. Euery man is willing to receiue wages, then let him be willing to worke. Paul ſaith, that 1 Cor. 9.17. 
                  hee hath a reward if he preach the Goſpell willingly. Men are vſually very cheerefull about their owne affaires, as in ſeking worldly promotion, profites & pleaſures; and is it ſeemely for Miniſters to be liue-leſſe and leaden-ſpirited about ſpirituall and celeſtiall labours, as in building Gods Temple, and in bringing men to promotion in heauen

and to the perpetuall pleaſures of that bliſ-full paradice? Shall the Diuell labour alacriouſly to ſeduce and peruert men, and ſhall not they ſtriue as ſtoutly and as cheerefully to conuert and ſaue men?

And ſhall not we be as cheerefull in the workes of our calling, that we may make ſome to riſe from ſinne, and ſurceaſe from wickedneſſe, and come out of the pit-fall, and ſnare of Sathan? Why ſhould not our labours be ſweete and pleaſing to vs, ſeeing they be commodious, commendable, and commanded? A man will gladly ſaue his Oxen from periſhing, and his ſheepe from rotting; and ſhall not we labour

as gladly to ſaue men from deſtruction, and to keepe the ſheepe of Chriſt Ieſus frō rotting in their ſins? Wilt thou willingly helpe thy ſheep out of the ditch, and ſaue her from drowning; and wilt thou not as willingly labour to drawe forth one of Chriſts ſheepe out of the ditch of iniquity, that it be not drowned with the waters of wickedneſſe, and be ſtifled with the mudde of ſinfulneſſe? A man is very nimble and ready to preſerue his fields from ſpoyling, his houſe from burning, and his children from pining; and ſhall not we be as nimble, as alacrious, and as ready to preſerue Gods field from being waſted, his houſe from being burnt, and his children from periſhing and pining away ſor want of food to comfort and vphold them? Willingly will euery faithfull ſhepheard feede and gouerne his flocke, which is committed to him. And ſo Peter ſpeaking to the ſhepheards of that Arch-paſtor Chriſt Ieſus, exhorteth them to performe their duty with alacrity. 1. Pet. 5 2

And they, that are to contend and encounter with that roaring Lyon, had neede to be Lyon-like, valorous and vndauntable. The Neh. 4.17. Builders of the ruined walles of Ieruſalem did their worke with one hand, and with the other held a ſword.

that they ſhould boldly deliuer their meſſage to his people. He which winketh at falſe doctrine, and reprehendeth not the ſins of the time and place wherein he liueth, and dares not for feare of contempt or diſgrace admoniſh the perſons that offend, is vnworthy and vnfit to be a Miniſter: who ought to be zealous and couragious, dreading Ier.

A three-fold cord is hardly crackt aſunder. A ſheafe of arrowes is

hardly broken. Thorefore as Labourers of one Lord, as Builders of one Houſe, as plowers of one fielde, as ſhepheards of one fold, as keepers of one garden, as dreſſers of one vineyard, as workemen in one harueſt, as watchmen of one city, as ſouldiers of one captaine, as ſeruants of one maiſter, and as ſonnes of one father, let vs all agree one with another, being coupled faſt together by one ſpirit, like linkes of one chaine, and as if there were but one temperature of all our bodies, and but one ſoule within them all. And accordingly let vs (vnitis viribus, ac toto conatu) ioyntly labour with might & maine, that Gods worke may goe forward, that the powers of darkneſſe may be ſhaken, that the gates of Hell may be flung from their hinges, and that (ſin and ſathan beeing diſmounted from their thrones) the ſcepter of Chriſt Ieſus may be ſet vp in the hearts of his people? If we muſt loue 2. Tim. 3.24.

another? Shall we be ſpitefull and crabbed one vnto another? God is 1. Ioh. 4.8.

But to returne from whence we haue digreſſed, ſhall Paul pray for the Romanes, for other men, that GOD would Rom. 15▪5. make them to be like-minded one towards another, and ſhal not we pray for our ſelues, and labour by all good meanes, that we may our ſelues bee ſo affected one with another? Members of one body are at peace with themſelues. The Church of God is a Eph. 5.23 
                  Body, euen the myſticall body of his ſonne Chriſt Ieſus. Now faithfull Miniſters are Members of this body; therefore they ought like fellow-members to embrace and agree with one another, Eph. 4.3. Gal. 5▪ 26. Eph 5.27 
                  endeuouring to keepe the vnity of the Spirit, in the bond of peace, not prouoking and enuying one another, but being ſubiect to one another in the feare of Chriſt. It were a prodigious ſight to ſee the Pillars of a Temple remoue, and ruſh one againſt another. The Church is Gods ſpirituall

Temple: and godly Miniſters are as Pillars to beare it vp. Therefore they ſhould ſtand peaceably one by another, and not iuſtle one with another. The miniſters and inſtruments of Sathan can conſpire together againſt God. Wherefore then ſhould not the Miniſters of God concord & agree together for God? Luk. 23.12. Act. 4.27. 
                  Herod & Pilate, the Iewes & the Romanes, could ioyne againſt Chriſt: why ſhould not we then conſent and labour together for Chriſt, that the Goſpell might flouriſh in the Chriſtian world, and that Chriſtian religion might ſpreade throughout the whole world? As Rom. 15.6. 
                  Paul wiſhed the Romanes one heart, that they might with one minde and one mouth praiſe GOD: euen ſo ſhould we that are Miniſters, tune all the ſtrings of our ſinfull ſoules, and labour for the ſweet concent and harmony of all the affections of our hearts, that with one mind & mouth wee may celebrate and preach the Lord, and proclaime the glad tidings of ſaluation to the ſonnes of men by

Ieſus Chriſt. Neither is it enough if ſome of vs be thus affected: but wee muſt all (all without exception) put on this minde. In an Inſtrument wee ſee that one or two ſtrings out of tune marre all the muſicke: and that in a Quire of voyces one or two being out of order, doe ſpoyle the melody: One iangling bell marres the whole ring. Euen ſo a few factious, turbulent and combuſtiue ſpirites, that (like Salamanders or Fireflies) delight in the firy flames of contention, and are in trauell with their home-bred conceits, till they haue thruſt them out (which are ſomthing like thornes in a dogges foot, which neuer leaues licking till hee haue got thē out) I ſay, a few ſuch diſorderly & vnquiet ſpirits, are able & apt (if they be not turned or taken quite away) to marre the muſicke of the Church, and to kindle a fire in it. For by nature we are too like to Gun-powder or Tinder; a few ſparkes are able, and would ſet vs all on fire, if neither Gods grace, nor ſeuere lawes and

ſtrength of authority did preuent & hinder vs. And that I may conclude this point, if tenne men did carry a great and weighty burthen, & if ſome of them ſhould kicke or buffet one another, their pace would be ſlakened, their buſineſſe hindred, & their burthen endangered to fall vnto the ground. The Church of God is a weighty burthen, and Miniſters are appointed by God, to beare it vpon their backes. Now if they beate and ſpurne at one another: or if ſome of them ſhall contemne kicke or buſſet one another, though others behaue themſelues diſcreetly and orderly: their buſineſſe muſt needes be hindered, the Chu

                  I laboured (ſaith Paul) more then they all: yet not I, but the grace of God, which is with me. Hence it is that 1 Pet. 5.10 
                  Peter commends the founding and eſtabliſhing of the faithfull vnto GOD. And looke what GOD founds, Sathan ſhall neuer confound. The Word preached ſincerely is not like a phyſicke medicine, which hath vertue in it by nature to cure a diſeaſe: but is as a Conduit-pipe, by which God the fountaine of grace conueieth his grace into the ciſterne of our hearts, when as he pleaſeth. Neither are Miniſters to be reputed as principall Agents, or authors of mans ſaluation, but as the liuely inſtruments of God, to whom he hath committed the 2 Cor. 5.19.

of his ſpirit, to cut downe the ſinnes of his children, and to ſlaughter their carnall luſts and corrupt affections through the mighty working of his ſpirit, accompanying their miniſtery. And though Paul take vnto him the name of an2 Cor. 2 15.16.

                  SEcondly, ſeeing Miniſters worke for God (as Factors vnder a Merchant) they may well expect his diuine protection in the faithfull performance of their office. A

Lord will maintaine the lawfull quarrel of his Labourers; ſpecially if it ariſe of the diligent and honeſt executiō of their duty, by him enioyned. A puiſſant and magnanimious Prince will defend his Embaſſadour ſo long as he carrieth his meſſage diſcreetly. And ſhall we thinke that the Lord of Lords, & Prince of all Princes will not defend & protect his faithful ſeruants & Embaſſadours? Yea he will both protect their perſons (as the eye of his wiſdome ſhal ſee fit) & proſper their meſſage in the thing, that Iſa. 55.11. pleaſeth him, either to the mollifying of mens minds, as the fire doth wax, or to the hardening of their hearts, as the Sun doth clay; ſo as that they are vnto him the ſweet ſauour of Chriſt,

And this protection & bleſſing of God his faithful Miniſters in all ages haue euer receiued according to his benigne admeaſurement, who aymeth alwaies at his own glory

which is the vtmoſt marke of all his thoghts. Eſay being aſſured of diuine protection ſaith; Iſa. 50.7. 
                  The Lord will helpe me; therefore ſhall I not be confounded: therefore haue I ſet my face as a flint, & I know that I ſhal not be aſhamed. And the Lord encouraging Ieremy to ſpeake his word boldly, ſaith, Ier. 1.8.18.19. I am with thee to deliuer thee. This day haue I made thee a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and walles of braſſe againſt the whole Land. They ſhall fight againſt thee, but they ſhall not preuaile againſt thee.

perſons, and watered their Labours with a floud of bleſſings. Now the Lord is the Heb. 1.12.

Therefore we muſt not be fainted-hearted, but confident in his mercy. He will couer vs with the wings of his grace, and cary vs vpō the back of his power ouer all our enimies.

Euen ſo vndoubtedly, the Lord (that hath both heauen and earth at command) will honour, countenance and kindly reward all his ſeruants, all his Embaſſadours, that execute their office, and carry their meſſage wiſely, ſincerely, and in loue vnto his Maieſty. Their reward is with God, they ſhall want no recompence. 1. Cor. 3 8

And if they that entertaine a Prophet, becauſe he is a Prophet, ſhall not miſſe a reward, then there is little reaſon to thinke that the Prophet himſelfe (behauing himſelfe as a Prophet of God ought to do) ſhal not be rewarded. The Labourers in the parable receiued their Mat. 20.8 
                  wages of the Lord of the vineyard, wherein they wrought, ſo ſoone as the euening came, and were called from their worke by the ſteward. In like manner ſo ſoone as the Lord doth ſend his Meſſenger

               The conſideration hereof teacheth vs to be diligent, and chearefull in our calling. Our labour is not loſt: a reward will come: we ſhall haue wages for our worke: we ſhall haue pleaſures for our paines. All our water ſhall be turned into wine: and our ſorrowes into ſolace.

               The Miniſters of Sathan are farre differing from the Lord our Maiſter: therefore if wee will not be like them, we muſt ſtriue to be like him. And vndoubtedly, if Miniſters wold carefully labor to reſemble their maiſter in patience, pitty, charity, truth, righteouſneſſe, holineſſe, gentleneſſe, goodneſſe, and in ſuch like properties, they ſhould not onely pleaſe him, and feele comfort in their conſciences, but alſo win greater eſtimation

to their calling, and leſſen their contempt in the world.

Paſtoris eſt paſcere, non piſcari: a ſheepheard ſhould not be fiſhing, when he ought to be feeding his ſheepe. Hired Laborers muſt not hinder their maiſters

                  s of the diuell, and to ruinate the Caſtles of iniquity, and the Turrets of all ſublimious and tranſcendent imaginations. Therefore they ought to liue like Souldiers,

minding their warfare (for their enemy is very puiſſant and politike, full of ſtratagems and wiles) and aboue all things labouring to pleaſe their Generall, that great Commander of the world, intāgling themſelues with nothing, which may let their faithfull ſeruice to him. The Apoſtles thought it not meet to leaue the word of God Act. 6.2 
                  to ſerue the tables. Maiſter Tindall ſaith, that to preach Gods word is too much for halfe a man: it requireth a whole man. Age quod tui muneris eſt: Do that (ſaith Valentinian to Ambroſe) which belongs to thy office. Verbi es Miniſter, hoc age: thou art a Miniſter, minde that: let thy principall care be fixed vpon thine owne calling. If many yrons be in the fire at once, ſome are in danger to be burnt. A calling that is ſo high, cannot endure that he which is called to it, ſhould (like an Earth-worme) carry his noſe vnto the ground, and addict himſelfe to the things that are ſo lowe. For Aug. 
                  Amor rerum terrenarum viſcus est ſpiritualium pennarum: the too much

minding and the loue of worldly things, are as Bird-lime to the wings of the ſoule, that a man cannot mount vp to heauen, and execute the workes of this heauenly office, as he ought to do. Let vs heare, what Muſculus ſaith. Vis cognoſcere verum Chriſti Miniſtrum: Wilt thou (ſaith he) know a true Miniſter of Chriſt? Then ſee if he be ſo vtterly ſeuered from all other buſineſſe, that he doth meditate, work, or liue in none other thing whatſoeuer, but in preaching and making manifeſt & plaine the Goſpel of Chriſt, and ſerue therein by all ſtrength and power whatſoeuer, that is in him.

                  e and gouerment of ſecular affaires is vtterly forbidden vnto Miniſters. Indeed they may not vſurpe authority: neither may they be carefull, and yet they muſt not be careleſſe. They muſt care, but they may not carke. Onely it is required that their ſecular affaires hinder not their conſtant care of the Church, &

the faithfull & alacrious performance of their office. For 1. Tim. 5.8. 
                  if their be any that prouideth not for his owne, and eſpecially for them that are of his owne family, he denieth the faith, and is worſe then an infidell. The Ioh. 21.3▪
                   Diſciples vſed their nets ſometimes, after that Chriſt had entertained thē to be his followers. And did not Chriſt himſelfe ſomtimes handle the Mark. 6.3. 
                  Axe? Paul forgot not his 2. Tim 4.13. 
                  cloake, which he left at Troas: and as neceſſity vrged, ſometimes Act. 20.34. 
                  wrought with his owne hands. It is required in a Biſhop, that he do not onely care for the Church of God, but alſo that he be able 1. Tim. 3.4.5. 
                  To rule his owne houſe honeſtly. Miniſters are men: they haue not only ſoules, but bodies. Samuel was a faithfull Prophet, and yet was able beſides his prophecying to do ſomethings elſe without impeachment of his credit, or diſgrace vnto his calling. Yet let vs alwaies remember that the edification of the Church by our Miniſtery (whether gubernatiue or operatiue) is the principall worke, which we ought all to follow, the hieſt

mark, at which we ought to leuell.

                  SEuenthly, conſidering that all faithful Miniſters do labour for the Lord, it is a thing both vnequal and vnconuenient that the people ſhould contemne or neglect any of them through their prepoſterous & vngrounded conceipts, and ſo addict themſelues to ſome, as that they nothing or little reſpect others, though their doctrine be found and their conuerſation blameleſſe. This was one of the faults, for which the Corinthians were reprehended Secondly, this ſin is a make-bate: it cauſeth contention, and ſtirreth vp ſtrife among brethren. The fire is great inough without this brand, theſe

bellowes. It were better to caſt on water, then to poure in oyle. Thirdly, this ſin is an enemy to Chriſt, and his Goſpell, and argueth ſelfe-loue, & weakneſſe of iudgment. Fourthly, it giues the Diuell aduantage, who is very vigilant and induſtrious to worke a miſchiefe, and is glad of the ſmalleſt opportunity: euer ready to take an Ell, when

Sixtly, it is a meanes to make thoſe to faint, which are contemned, vnleſſe their courage be the greater: and an ocaſion to puffe vp the other, if their humility and wiſedome be no better then their factious and vnorderly followers. And laſtly our ſin will be the rather increaſed, if we wil be tainted with it, ſeeing we know that it was taxed as a weakeneſſe in the Corinthians. Let vs therefore be wiſe, and wiſely beware of all prepoſterous and vnequal opinions of the Miniſters of God. They do all of them work vnder him in his

Amongſt many builders, ſowers and reapers, none that are diſcreet and diligent, are contemned or baſely reckoned of, though there be greater dexterity, skill, and hability in ſome thē in others. Candles that giue good light are not caſt away, though they be not ſo great, and caſt not ſo much light, as ſome others do. A Lamp is ſeruiceable, though it blaze not ſo much as a Torch: neither is there any mettall contemned, though all mettall be not gold.

The Miniſter of the Church (ſaith Chryſoſtome) ought to be honoured of thee, becauſe he praieth for thee, becauſe he miniſtreth ſpiritually vnto thee, viſiteth thee, exhorteth and admoniſheth thee, and commeth to thee, if thou call him, at midnight.

                  Angell of God, yea as Chriſt himſelfe, and would haue plucked out their eyes, if it might haue bene, and haue giuen them vnto him. Euſebius writeth, that Conſtantine iudged the Miniſters which he called to him (ſemper honore praecipuo dignos:) worthy alwaies of ſingular honor, and that hee

did reuerence them (Omni officio) with all dutifulneſſe, and omitted no point of kindneſſe or courteſie (nihil benignitatis aut humanitatis) towards thoſe that were deuout & godly. Syracides would haue vs to Ecclus. 38.1. 
                  honour the Phyſitian of the body: much more therefore ſhould we honour the Phyſitians and Chirourgians of our ſoules. And we ſhall leeſe nothing by our loue. For (as our Sauiour ſaith) He which

                  truth it ſelfe) doth affirme in word, he will alſo (being Tit. 2.13. 
                  Might it ſelfe) confirme in deed. Heauen and Earth ſhall rather faile, then his word ſhall fall, and not be fulfilled.
               Now this honour, which is due to Gods Miniſters (of what place or ſtile ſoeuer) may be performed ſix ſundry waies. Firſt, by reuerencing their perſons: ſecondly, by obeying their Miniſtery: thirdly, by imitating their vertues: fourthly, by concealing their infirmites: fiftly, by countenancing and

backing them: and ſixtly by maintaining their eſtates. And of all theſe we will briefly ſpeake, and in order, as they lye.

                  FIrſt then, it is fit that Miniſters ſhould haue all ſeemly reuerence due by deſert to ſo ſublimious and reuerend a calling. And it muſt begin in the hart, and be teſtified in the life by reuerent behauiour, by comely geſtures, and by temperate & good language both of them & to them. Men muſt Tit. 3.2. 
                  ſpeake euill of no man, but muſt be moderate, and ſhew all meekeneſſe towards all men; therfore they ſhould in no caſe ſpeak ill of Gods Miniſters, but vſe them kindly, & with al courteſie. Courteſie ſhewed to a Miniſter, as he is a Miniſter, is ſhewed euē to Chriſt himſelfe, whoſe Miniſter he is; & it is ſo reputed. Ieremy accompteth it one of their

plagues, that their Lam. 4.16 enemies reuerenced not the face of their Prieſts. The Lord eſteemeth a diſgrace done vnto his faithfull Miniſters, as done vnto himſelfe. Princes, we ſee, take to thē
                  ſelues thoſe words, or workes of diſhonor, which are ſpoken or done deſpightfully to their Agents & Embaſſadours, for deliuering their meſſage truly, as it was giuen them in charge. When Dauids Meſſengers which he ſent in courteſie to Hanun King of Ammon, were diſhonorably intreated, and miſuſed of him and his people; the ſtory ſaith, that 2 Sam. 10 
                  they ſtanke in the ſight of Dauid for abuſing them ſo vilely. Euen ſo do they ſtinke (as loathſome carrions) in the noſthrils of the Lord, (be they what they will be) that diſgrace and abuſe his Miniſters whom he kindly ſendeth to them to preach his will, and to proclaime his Son to be their king. God tooke the reprochfull and rayling language of Senacherib againſt Iſay. 37.22.23. 
                  Ieruſalem and Hezekiah, as ſpoken againſt himſelfe. They which miſuſe a

ſeruant of a noble man, as he is his ſeruant, diſhonour the noble man himſelfe. Chriſt maketh the Math. 23.37. 
                  killing and contemning of Gods Prophets, the higheſt ſtaire of rebellion. And vndoubtedly God will be reuenged on thoſe that diſgrace and abuſe his Miniſters (vnleſſe they do repent maturely) as Dauid was of the Ammonites for diſgracing his Meſſengers. We know how by two 2 King. 2.24.

               CHAP. 23. The people muſt obey the miniſtery of their Miniſters.
               
                  SEcondly, the people honor their Miniſters when they ſubmit thēſelues vnto their Miniſtery. Reuerence without obedience, is a ceremony without

ſubſtance, a body without a ſoule; a ſtick without ſtrength; and not vnlike the commō complements of this age. Heb 13 17. 
                  Obey them (ſaith the Holy Ghoſt) that haue the ouerſight of you, and ſubmit your ſelues. Paul looked that the 2. Cor. 2.9. 
                  Corinthians ſhould be obediēt to him in all things. And in truth men cannot better commend their Miniſters, then when by being obedient vnto their Miniſtery, they liue religouſly, and are fruitfull in good works. Whē a child doth thriue well, and is ſtrong and luſty, the praiſe redounds to the nurſe: and it is a reall commendation of a Sheepheard, when his ſheep are fat and ſound. Euen ſo ſhall wee greatly commend & honour our Miniſters, if we ſhall ſubmit our ſelues vnto their voyce, and ſhall by that means grow in grace, abound in knowledge & true zeale, & ſhine by our vertuous liues among men.
               But this our obedience and ſubmiſſion muſt be in the Lord; to wit, ſo long as they keepe themſelues to the Law and to the Teſtimony, to the word

of God: which is the Touch-ſtone of truth, the rule of teligion, the ſquire of faith, the line of loue, the Met-wand of obedience, & as a Salomons ſword to decide a controuerſie. For to Gods word alone were the Ier. 1.17. Ez. 33.7. Mat. 28.20 Prophets and Apoſtles tyed by their commiſſion. What I ſhall command thee, that ſhalt thou ſpeake. Ye ſhall teach whatſoeuer I haue commanded you. He which then heareth them, heareth God and he which diſpiſeth & diſobeyeth them, deſpiſeth and diſobeyeth God that ſent thē, & Act. 7.52 
                  reſiſteth his Spirit ſpeaking by them. The Lord reckoneth this among the Ez. 33 3

                   ſins of the Iſraelites, that they ſate before his Prophet, & heard his words, but would not do them.Zach. 7.12 13. Pro. 1.28. 
                  Zachary ſaith, that becauſe they would not heare the voyce of God in his Prophets, therefore he would not heare them, when they cried to him. And becauſe the Iſraelits mocked Gods 2. Chron. 36. 
                  meſſēgers & deſpiſed his words deliuered by thē, & miſuſed them, he brought vpon thē the Caldean king, by whom he ſcourged their cōtempt

and rebellion with fowre fearefull iudgements. Firſt, hee permitted him to kill both old and yong without pitty. Secondly, he let him rob them of their goods, and cary away their treaſure. Thirdly, he ſuffered him to burne their Temple, and to breake downe the walles of Ieruſalem, and to fire her Palaces. Fourthly, he was content that he ſhould make ſlaues of them in his owne country, that had eſcaped his ſword. As we therefore Ier. 6.19 Ier. 7.13.15 
                  dread the iudgements of God, and would not haue him count vs miſuſers of his Miniſters, and deſpiſers of his meſſage, let vs reuerence their perſons and regard their Miniſtery.

So long as they teach the truth, they muſt be heard. Thy Miniſters wickedneſſe muſt not make thee wilfull: his folly may not make thee froward. Balaam muſt heare his Aſſe ſpeake, becauſe God ruled her tongue, and made her ſpeake vnto him.

And againe; God worketh (per omnes) by all (ſalutem populi moliens) ſeeking the ſaluation of the people, (non illorum intuens merita) not regarding their deſarts. Euen as light (ſaith Auguſtine) is not defiled though it paſſe by filthy places, and men enioy it voide of all defilement: ſo it is in the Miniſtery. Men may receiue benefite by the pure word of God, though it come out of an vnpure mouth. Neither is good doctrine defiled by bad manners: neither doth God conferre grace, becauſe the Miniſter is a godly man: nor diſdaine to giue it, becauſe he is profaine.

But if ſome tares or cockle, ſome duſt or darnell come with the good ſeed, thou muſt let thē go (like things vnprofitable & fit for the fire) but thou maiſt not contemne & caſt away the good for the euill. Thou muſt not refuſe the corne for the chaffe, but rather

ſift and winnow them. A wiſe man will not caſt away good meate for a few moats. Thou wilt not caſt away good ſiluer, becauſe there is ſome droſſe in it, or ſome copper peeces amongſt it. Thou wilt not contemne a bag of gold, becauſe there is ſome counters in it; wherefore then ſhouldſt thou reiect profitable inſtructions, and wholeſome doctrines and admonitions, becauſe they come with ſome vnſauory ſtuffe, and are mixed with ſome vanity? Hearken to the counſel of Saint Paul, whoſe pen was guided by Gods owne hand: 1. Theſ. 5 20.21. 
                  Deſpiſe not prophecying, ſaith he. Now becauſe ſome might ſay, that the Prophet may mixe ſome of his owne leauen with Gods dough, and ſo make ſoure bread, & preach linſi-wolſy ſermons; he doth therefore immediately adde: Try all things, & keepe that which is good. Wee muſt not be like a bottom-leſſe bagge, that holds nothing: nor like the ſcuttle, that holds both the wheat & the chaffe together: nor like the Cernicle, or Boulter, that lets

the fine flower go, and keepes in the branne: but we ſhould bee like the Skrie, that ſeuereth the good from the badde. We ſhould bee wiſe to diſcerne betwixt true doctrine and errours: and we ſhould haue our wits exerciſed to iudge betwixt good and euill: and when we ſee the difference betweene them being both obiected to vs, we ſhould wiſely elect the good, and reiect the bad.
            
            
               CHAP. 24. The people ought to imitate the godly vertues of their Ministers.
               
                  THirdly, honour is exhibited to Gods Miniſters by imitating their Chriſtian vertues, which doe ſhine within them as the Lampes did in the Tabernacle, and do (as the candle out of the lant-horne) giue light to thoſe that loue the light. It is one

way, whereby we honour thoſe that are departed in the faith, when we reſemble them in thoſe heauenly graces, (which like the ſtarres of heauen) did ſhine within them, while they were aliue. And indeed we do performe an act of honour vnto any man, when we ſtriue to imitate his good conditions, and to walke exactly in his foot-ſteps. This honour the holy Ghoſt giueth to all godly Miniſters, when he exhorteth vs ſaying: Hebr. 13.8. 
                  Remember thē that haue the ouerſight ouer you, which haue declared vnto you the word of God: whoſe faith follow. And Saint Paul claimeth it of the 1 Cor. 11.1. Phil. 3.17. 1 Theſ 1.6. 2 Theſ. 3.5 1. Pet. 5.3. 
                  Corinthians, where he ſaith: Be ye followers of me, euen as I am of Chriſt. Miniſters ought to make themſelues Enſamples for vs to follow: and when they do ſo, we ſhall both diſhonour them, and diſpleaſe the Lord, if we do not labour to be like them. Their good examples ſhould be as ſpurres in our ſides to make vs run more liuely in our Chriſtian race: and they ſhould be as ſauce to make vs

affect and digeſt our meate the better. And if we will not ſtudy to reſemble them, we ſhall both manifeſt a peruerſe and illiberall diſpoſition, and make our ſelues the more vnexcuſable when God ſhall iudge vs. Therefore as the Painter doth draw an image in his head firſt, and then with his hand according to the patterne ſet before him, and conceiued in his mind: ſo ſhould we ſet the vertues of godly Miniſters before our eyes, as patternes for to follow; and hauing conceiued and entertained them in our heades and hearts, wee ſhould expreſſe them in our liues by the actions of our hands, and in the continuall current of our conuerſations. And ſo ſhall we commend our ſelues without one word of commendation: ſo ſhall we honour and animate them: ſo ſhall we dignifie our profeſſion, and glorifie him that ordained Pro. 16.4 
                  all things for his glory.
            
            
               
               CHAP 25. Men ſhould wiſely conceale the infirmities of their Miniſters, and not blaze them abroade.
               
                  FOurthly, Miniſters are honored, when their infirmities are not publiſhed (in Gath) to their diſhonour, but buried by loue in the graue of ſilence and obliuion. Iam. 3.2.

The cleareſt glaſſe is ſubiect vnto ſoyling. There is no ſoule without ſome ſinne,Eccleſ. 7.22. no man without a fault. And therefore as we ought to beare with one another, and patiently pardon all ſlips of weakneſſe (Pro. 10.12. 
                  for loue couereth a multitude of treſpaſſes) ſo eſpecially ought we to conceale & forgiue the infirmities of Miniſters, in their words, workes and geſtures. And ſo we ſhall ſhew our ſelues the

children of wiſedome, the followers of peace and amity, true louers of God and his children, faithfull and good ſchollers, and vnlike many wretches, that are euen heart-merry when they can ſpy a moate in a Miſters eye, or an hole in his coate, at which they may mocke and ieſt: vngodly Gen. 9.22.

                  FIftly, men do honor the Miniſters of Chriſt, when they countenance them, and take part with them againſt their malitious and wicked enemies, and when they labour to defend their credits and good name againſt all their back-biters, traducers and maligners, and are not aſhamed to acknowledge and aſſiſt them, notwithſtanding

the greatneſſe or the multitude of their vngodly aduerſaries which ſet themſelues againſt God & all goodnes. And this all men ought to do for their Miniſters (euer remembring that they paſſe not the precincts of their calling, and be not tranſported with a prepoſterous zeale, and a vaine conceit of enmity and hoſtile perſecution, when there is no ſuch matter) that ſo they may confirme their loue vnto them, which they do in ſhew profeſſe, and encourage thē to go on conſtantly in their miniſtery, that they may be faithfull in Gods houſe, as Heb. 3.

The very ſlaues of Antichriſt fared, and yet fare in ſome countries, farre better then the

moſt faithfull ſeruants of Chriſt do amōgſt vs in many places of this Iland. Yea that may be as truly ſaied in this preſēt caſe, of many thouſands in this Natiō, which Iob. 24.11. 
                  Iob ſpeaketh of ſome in his time: that they which make oyle between their walles, and treade their wine-preſses, do ſuffer thirſt. Lamentable is the pouerty of many painfull & godly Miniſters that tread the wine-preſse of Gods word vnto the people cōtinually, & affoord thē the oyly drops of the Goſpell, and the wine of diuine inſtructions, counſels, comforts and exhortations. I ſay, lamentable is their want and without compaſſion beheld of many. But their reward is with God, their labours ſhall retire into their owne boſomes, God will ſhew the greater mercy to them in the end. Many men are franke and lauiſh in keeping Vt nil aſperius nddam 
                  Haukes, Houndes, Horſes, and in maintaining Players, and making belly-cheere, and vaine attire, but as ſordide and illiberall, when they ſhold impart any thing towards the maintenance of their Paſtors

and Preachers. Which argueth their baſe, thankleſſe, and earthly diſpoſition: If the law (for the Lord they regard not) did not conſtraine many men to giue, their deuotion is ſo cold, & their ingratitude ſo great, as that they would contribute nothing at al this way, except it were for very ſhame, or for ſome by-reſpect. So hard frozen are their hearts, and ſo faſt wedged into the earth. Whereas common reaſon ſheweth, that they which ſpend themſelues like lampes to giue light to others, and labour for the common good of all, ſhould be maintained of the common ſtock by all. Miniſters are commanded to 1. Tim.

of their Maiſter.
               Secondly, thoſe are to be condemded, which do Rapapes. 
                  rob the Church of her right, and do ſacrilegiouſly (whether it be by fraud or by force) deteine from, or depriue their Miniſters of that, which in all equity is due vnto them, euen by the Law. There are too many ready now to ſay with thoſe in the Pſalme; Pſa. 8

But alas, alas, the deuotion and loue of this age is ſo extreeme cold, as that we will hardly part with that, which we are tyed to part with; yea a many of vs are ready to pull from them, what we can pull by hooke or by crooke. It is written of Hanun that he tooke 2. Sam. 10.4. 
                  Dauids Meſſengers, and ſhaued off halfe their beardes, and cut off their garments in the middle.
               So their are a number of ſacrilegious

wretches in this rotten age of the world, which pill the Church, and curtaile the maintenance of their Miniſters, and are euen heart-glad, when they can proue a cuſtome, how corrupt and ſenſeleſſe ſoeuer it be, to hold back their tithes. Which argues a ſpirituall dropſy, or elſe a baſeneſſe of minde, and intollerable vnthankfulneſſe for the Goſpell. The Lord by Malachy told the Iſraelites, that they Mal. 3.8.9. 
                  ſpoiled him, becauſe they payed not their tithes truly: yea he told thē further, that they were curſed with a curſe for ſo doing. Are not the faithful Miniſters of the Goſpell as worthy to be maintained, as the Prieſts were vnder the Law? Are they not as worthy of plentifull prouiſion, as they were? Yea no doubt in many reſpects. How then do they ſpoile and rob the Lord, that do not pay theis tithes and offerings truly vnto his Miniſters, but deceiptfully and vntruly? Let them looke vnto it, and that before it be too late. Let them either forſake their ſacriledge, or expect his curſe.

For without doubt the Lord doth abhorre ſuch wickedneſſe: and he will not alwaies winke at it. The Lord is not ſo ſlow, but he is as ſure. Lento gradu ad vindictam ira diuina procedit, ſed tarditatem ſupplicij grauitate iudicii compenſat.

Wherefore (brethren) be now admoniſhed with all lowlineſſe and truth of heart to reuerence your Miniſters, to obey their Miniſtery, to

imitate their vertues, to countenance them, and pray for them. And robbe them not of that, which in conſcience is their right: but rather ſtraine your ſelues that they may not lacke, but haue ſufficient maintenance to mainetaine their eſtates, to the credit of their calling, which is moſt honorable and holy.

               1. COR. 3.9.
               Ye are Gods Huſbandry: ye are Gods Building.
            
            
               CHAP. 1. The words are explained: and their ſenſe declared.
               
                  THE Apoſtle hauing ſhewed the Corinthians what he was, with the reſt of his fellow-miniſters, he doth in theſe words ſhew them alſo what they themſelues are. Now before we weigh anchor, and launch forward with our veſſels into the deepe, it wil be firſt conuenient for vs to break the ice & by the explicatiō of the words

to prepare a way for the collection & application of the doctrines.
               Ye) Euen ye Corinthians, ye that are not Iewes, but Gentiles; yea ye that are ouer-carnall, and ſomething factious; of what ſex or ſort ſoeuer.
               
                  Are) Ye are now Gods Husbandry, and Building, notwithſtanding thoſe infirmities which I reprehend and diſlike in you.
               
                  Gods) The word (God) vſed properly, is ſometimes taken perſonally; as in Iohn 3.16. for God the Father: in the Acts 20.28. for God the Sonne: and in the Acts. 5.3.4. for God the holy Ghoſt. Which three, are 1. Ioh. 5.7. not three ſeuerall Gods, but three diſtinct perſons ſubſiſting in the Godhead. For Deut. 6.4. 1. Cor. 8.4 there is but one God in nūber. And ſometimes alſo this word is taken eſſentially: as in Iohn. 4.24. And ſo it may be very fitly taken (as I thinke) in this text. And ſo by God, we may vnderſtand all the three perſons, to whom the Godhead doth in Vt res ſuis modis, qui ſunt in re.
                  common without inequality, diuiſion, and tranſmutation, appertaine.

For the Scriptures plainly teach, that we are an houſe belonging to them all. We are the Fathers houſe, Epheſ. 2.22. And the Sonnes houſe, Eph. 3.17. Heb. 3.6. And the holy Ghoſts. 1. Cor. 3.16. and 6.19. All things whatſoeuer (that are not meerely wicked) belong vnto them equally, by vertue of their abſolute Lordſhip and dominion ouer all.
               Husbandry) The originall word (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ) tranſlated hu
                        •
                     bandry, doth properly ſignify a field, or peece of ground tilled, husbanded, and wrought vpon: or a field, on which the husband-man beſtowes his worke and labour. Building) the Greeke word (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ) tranſlated Building hath three diſtinct ſignifications in the new Teſtament. Firſt, it ſignifieth the action of building in a metaphoricall ſignification, as in the 2. Cor. 10.8. And in Epheſ. 4.12. Secondly, it ſignifieth the things which do build, or edify ſpiritually, as in the 1. Cor. 14.3. Thirdly, it ſignifieth a thing builded, or an houſe: as in Mat. 24.1.

And in the 2. Cor. 5.1. And ſo the word is vſed in this text.
               Now the Church of God (for this ſpeech of Paul is not excluſiue, but includeth all faithfull Chriſtians in all other Churches beſides, as appeareth by comparing this place with Epheſ. 2.21. and 1. Tim. 3.15. and 1. Pet. 2.5.) I ſay the Church of God may be compared to a field and H
                        •
                     uſe, for the proportion & congruity that is betwixt them; which is manifold.
               
                   Firſt, fields haue their boundes,
and houſes haue their compaſſe or limits, which they cannot paſſe: and ſo hath Gods Church.
               
                   Secondly, euery field is layed and
limited by ſome man: & euery houſe hath her compaſſe ſet her by ſome man or other: ſo it is with Gods Church. The Lord hath appointed her bounds, & hath giuen her a compaſſe, which ſhe ſhall not tranſcend and paſſe.
               
                   Thirdly, euery field is taken in ou
                     •
                  
of the open champion or common

by ſome man. For no field can make it ſelfe; eſpecially no plowed-field There muſt needs be a man to make it, and to appoint it to ſuch an vſe. And as Hebr. 3.4. euery houſe is built by ſome body; ſo is the Church. God hath taken her in out of the vaſt wilderneſſe of this wicked world, he hath imparked her with the pales of his mercy, he doth fence her in with the quickſet hedge of his gracious protection, he doth ſeparate her frō al other grounds and make her the field and garden of his owne delight. And the ſame God alſo doth build and reare her vp to be an houſe or temple. The 
                  Pſal. 147.2.3. 
                  Lord (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) doth build vp Ieruſalem, and gather together the diſperſed of Iſrael He healeth thoſe that are broken in heart, and bindeth vp their ſores. As by him we receiue the life of nature: ſo likewiſe by him we do receiue the life of grace. He breatheth into vs the breath of life corporal and ſpirituall. He is the fountaine of all liuing waters, & the root, from which the iuce of true Chriſtian life doth

iſſue, and proceed vnto vs. And as we are made men by him: ſo are we alſo made new men; and therefore Paul cals vs his Ephe. 2.10. 
                  workmanſhip. For he doth hew vs out of the rocke Chriſt Ieſus. He cuts vs and ſquares vs out. He reares vs vp, and ioynes vs together by the bond of his Spirit, and by the links of true loue, as it were with pins and with lime, & ſoulder. And whoſoeuer builds, if he proſper not their building with the preſence & proppe of his grace, their building is in vaine. Nothing can ſtand: all will fall, and tumble downe againe like the ſtone of Siſyphus, or like a wall that is dawbed with vntempered mortar. Therefore we pray with 1. Pet. 5 10. 
                  Peter, that he would make you perfect, confirme, ſtrengthen, ſtabliſh, and (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ) found you,
               
                   Fourthly, as fields are vſually laid
and incloſed and wrought in by diuerſe labourers: & as houſes are commonly reared, repaired and wrought in by ſundry workmen: one perhaps being the ringleader, the cōmaunder

of the reſt. Euen ſo the Church is husbāded, builded & kept by many.
               Many labour within her and about her. God is the principal Agent. He cals the reſt: he directs and rules them. He puts his word into their mouths, and proſpers it, as it pleaſeth him. It is his Arme, whereby he doth tranſlate men out of the kingdome of ſathan into the kingdome of his Son, out of darkneſſe into light, out of Aegipt into Canaan, out of hell into heauen. It is his Hammer whereby he doth beate down our pride: it is as a Wedge, whereby he doth cleaue vs: his Axe, which hewes vs: & his Rule, which meaſures vs. It is alſo his Plough, which breakes vs vp: it is his Cylinder, which ſmoothes vs, and the ſeed which he ſowes in vs. And all the good ſucceſſe proceeds from him. Not vnto vs, not vnto vs, but vnto God belongs this honour. It is he that Phil. 2.13 
                  worketh both the will and the deed: it is he that 1. Cor. 3.6. Phil. 1.6. 
                  giues the increaſe: it is he that begins and makes an end.
               The Miniſters of the Word & Sacraments,

are his Inſtruments or ſeruants, Eph 4.11.12. ordained for the reparation of the Sancts, and for the edification of Chriſts body: that is to ſay, to worke in Gods houſe and vineyard, to labour in his Church, that his people may be conuerted, comforted, confirmed & inſtructed, till they attaine to the perfection of grace, & fulneſſe of glory with their Head & Husband Chriſt Ieſus in the heauens. In which reſpect the Apoſtle tels the Corinthians, that they are1. Cor. 9.2. 
                  his work in the Lord.
               Fiftly, euery houſe is founded vpon ſome foundation: ſo is the Church of God. And her foundation is twofold: principall, & miniſteriall. The principall 1. Cor. 3.11. 
                  foundation is Chriſt: and therefore he is called (Lapis fundamenti) the Iſa. 28.16 
                  foundation ſtone, and (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ) the 1. Pet. 2.6 
                  Bottom-corner ſtone. He is that Mat. 16 18. 
                  Rocke, whereupon the Church is built. He is the author of our goodneſſe, and the procurer of all our glory. He hath merited for vs the pardon of ſin, the perfection of happineſſe, and the perpetuity of all

our welfare. And as God did create vs Ioh. 1.3. 
                  by him in regard of nature, ſo he doth create vs againe Eph. 2.10 
                  in him in regard of grace, and will one day finiſh vs fully for him in regard of glory. Here is a good foundation; a foundation that is firme and and not falſe, ſound and not ſandy. Whatſoeuer is built vpon this foundation firmely, ſhall neuer be caſt downe wholy. The top ſhall fare the better for the bottome.
               The Miniſteriall foundation is the preaching of the doctrine of ſaluatiō, contained in the writings of the Prophets & Apoſtles. Therfore Paul ſaith that we are built Eph. 2.20 
                  vpon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets. And Saint Ambroſe ſaith accordingly, that the Old and New Teſtament is the foundation of the Church. And hence it is that the citty of God is ſaid to haue Reu. 21.14. twelue foundations, in which were written the twelue names of the Apoſtles of the Lambe. And thus Peter, Iames and Iohn, and all faithfull Paſtors may be called Pillars of the

Church, to wit, ſo farrre forth as by their Miniſtery they do ſuſteine and maintaine the Church of God, & the true profeſſion of the true faith: Chriſt Ieſus onely being the Eph. 2.22 
                  chiefe corner ſtone, who onely doth properly and energetically ſupport and hold vp all the building.
               
                   Sixtly, euery field and houſe is ſeated
in ſome place: ſo is the Church of God. And if we regard her military condition, ſhe is ſeated vpon the earth, euen in the middeſt of her enemies, which ſwarme like Bees about her. And as we ſee chaffe and wheat mingled together in one heape, and both fiſh and frogges incloſed in one net: ſo ſhall her members be mingled together with the wicked ſo long as ſhe makes her aboade on the earth, ſo long as ſhe liues in the Wilderneſſe, and vntill ſhe receiue her inheritance in celeſtiall Canaan.
               
               
                   Seuenthly, fields ſerue for tillage
and husbandry, and for his vſe that occupies and orders them. Euery field hath an owner, and euery houſe

hath an inhabitant, and one to who
                     •
                   ſhe doth belong, and for whoſe vſe ſhe ſerues. So the Church hath her vſe, owner, and inhabitant. 1. Cor. 3 16. 
                  Kno
                        •
                      ye not (ſaith Paul) that ye are the Temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? Yea 
                  2. Cor. 6.16. 
                  you are the Temple of the liuing God; as God ſayd; I will dwell in them, and walke in them. The Lord is her owner and inhabitant: he hath ordained her for his owne glory: and for his vſe ſhee ſerues.
               
                   Eightly, as euery field hath a gate or way to come into it: and as euery houſe hath a doore for men to enter in at: ſo hath the Church. Chriſt is the gate and the doore, by whom wee enter into the Church: and if we do not enter in by him, we ſhall neuer enter ſo into it, as to be truly of it. The Goſpell of Chriſt is an ordinary outward meanes or way, by which we are brought into the Church and made her members: and Baptiſme is a ſigne of our entrance and admiſſion into it.
               
                  
                   Ninthly, as a field ha
                     •
                  h diuers parcels and corners in it: and as a faire and goodly building hath many roomes parts, & chambers in it. So the Church of God hath many parts or parcels, as ſubiects of one kingdome, as members of one body, as parts of one field, as beds of one garden, and chambers of one houſe.
               
                   Tenthly, as there is no field, which
hath not in it ſome difference of the mowle or earth, or ſome diuerſity of the plants and hearbs which it beareth. And as houſes vſually receiue into them diuers perſons, which keepe in them, & belong vnto them. And as (for the moſt pa
                     •
                  t) euery houſe conſiſteth of ſundry ſorts of matter, as wood, ſtone, lime, clay, &c. Euen ſo the Church of God (as a ſpacious and fruitfull field is full of variety of plants, (as it were) and hearbs. Many and diuers are her fruits. And ſome part of her, ſome perſons that belong vnto her, are more fruitfull and excellent then other, according to the difference of their mowle, or of

the coſt & labour which is ſpent vpon them. There is not the ſame influence of heauenly graces deſcending from aboue, vpon them all alike. The Sunne of righteouſnes doth not ſend downe the beams of his effectuall operation equally vpon them. And the great Husbandman beſtoweth not his paines alike vpon them all. In like manner the Church of God as a ſumptuous and ſtately building, receiueth and entertaineth many into her. God is the principall and commander of all the reſt. And all the faithfull (which being ſimply by themſelues conſidered are exceeding many) are his houſhold 
                  Ephe. 2.19. 
                  ſeruants, which abide and liue in her, and are all maintained & prouided for by the Lord that great houſe-holder. And as houſes are ordinarily made of diuers things: or if there be an houſe built all of ſtones, yet one ſtone differeth from another, either in quantity or in quality, colour or ſcituation. So in Gods houſe which is made of 1 Pet. 2.5 
                  liuing ſtones, one ſtone

one part, differeth from another. There is a fundamentall and chiefe corner ſtone, which is Ieſus Chriſt, that 1 Pet. 2.4 
                  Liuing ſtone; euen Life it ſelfe, and the Wel-ſpring of all our life: and there are alſo vpper ſtones, which are of leſſe importance. And of theſe ſome are better coloured then others: ſome are larger, and ſome are leſſer: ſome exceed others in grace, and ſhal excell them alſo in glory. Againe, ſome are cut out of the Rocke before others, and put into the building firſt: and many which the builder medleth with laſt, may be made more comly & glorious, then ſome others which were hewed out, and ſet in the building before them. For all their preferment, all their comlineſſe is at the free diſpoſement of their Architect.
               
                   Furthermore, as diuers things
muſt be prepared before a field can be taken in and ſeuered from other groundes: before it will bee fit for ſeede and plants, ſome labour muſt be ſpent about it: ſo before the Lord

doth call & take vs to be a field vnto himſelfe, out of the barren heath, and wide wilderneſſe of this ſinfull world; & before he ſowes the ſeeds of his graces, & ſets the pleaſant plants of true chriſtiā vertues in our hearts, he prepares and fits vs ordinarily by the miniſtery of his word, ioyning therewith ſometimes alſo croſſes and aflictions, and ſome other things, which he hath prouidently prepared and wiſely directeth for our good. And euen as wood, ſtone, brick, lime, and ſuch like things▪ as concurre to the making of an houſe, muſt be fitted and layed together, before the houſe can be made: ſo the Lord doth prepare and vnite the faithfull together, that they may be one indiuidual and entire building. And vntill they be all collected & compacted faſt together, Gods houſe ſhall not be fully finiſhed. And as ſtones in an houſe cannot without mortar be layed faſt and firme: neither can the poſts, the beames, and ſpires be well and ſurely ioyned without pinnes, nailes, or

barres of yron: euen ſo the liuing ſtones of Gods houſe, the true members of his Church, cannot be cloſely coupled, and ſtrongly knit together without true Chriſtian charity, and his moſt holy Spirit.  Againe, as all
things concurring to the building of an houſe, being well compoſed, do make much for the beauty of that houſe: ſo all the faithfull being cunningly compact and laid together of God (as it were by line & leuell) do make for the ſtatelineſſe and glory of his houſe, which conſiſteth onely of Beleeuers. And as all the parts of a field, the variety of hearbes, the diuerſity of fruits, and the comly orders and rankes of plants, do greatly commend and ſet forth the field in which they are: euen ſo the Church which is Gods field, is greatly beautified and adorned through the multitude & great diuerſity of her members, which are (as it were) ſundry ſorts of ſets or hearbs; as alſo by reaſon of that comly order, which he (the Husbandman) hath ſet among them.
               
                  
                   Moreouer, fields are not in their perfect glory ſo ſoone as they be taken in: and the plantes and ſeedes that are ſet and ſowne in them, come not preſently, but by degrees to their full perfection, and growth. So the Church is pe
                     •
                  fited by degrees: her plantes grow vp by little and little: and the ſeedes of Gods graces, which are ſowen in our hearts ſpring vp, grow, and multiply by degrees, and not all at once. The flints, the ſtones, and ſtinking weedes, are not all remoued and gathered out of vs at the firſt. The hardneſſe of our hearts, the flintineſſe of our affections, and the weeds of wickedneſſe are not at one inſtant, but by degrees remoued and taken away. And as no field is incloſed and taken out of the heath or common in one moment of time, but one part after another. So God doth not take in the whole Church, and by effectuall vocation ſeuer her, and call her out of the world, and inuiron her with his fauour reuealed to her at one point of time; but he doth

it by degrees at ſeueral times, in that order and maner, which in his wiſedome he ſeeth moſt beſeeming, and which before all time hee did with himſelfe decree. In like maner alſo, as no houſe is built vp all at once, but by degrees: ſo is the Church in generall, and we that are her particular members, erected and perfited by peecemeale, and in proceſſe of time. And we do not attaine to our ful perfection whiles we liue heere. Eccleſ. 7.22. For there is no man iuſt in the earth, that doth good, and ſinneth not. The cleareſt riuer hath ſome mudde in the bottome, and the healthieſt body hath ſome corruption in it. So the pureſt ſoule is notwithout ſome ſin. Regeneration doth not in this life wholly extirp originall corruption, but onely weaken, abate, and waſt it by degrees. For while we liue, ſinne ſhall not dy: but death that receiued life from ſin, muſt be the death of ſinne. Our ſins and we ſhall dye together. And when the threed of this momentany life is cut aſunder by death, and a diſſolution

or diuorcement made betwixt thoſe two parts of man, which God did at the firſt vnite and wedde, to make a perfect man; the one muſt for a time returne vnto the earth, and the other ſhall be taken vp into heauen, thereto receiue both perfect grace & perfect glory: & when God ſhal after a time repeale & end the ſeparation, & reunite them, then they ſhal iointly receiue both holines & happines in al perfection without future alteration, in the paradiſe of God, Pſa. 16.11 
                  In whoſe preſence there is fulneſſe of ioy, and at whoſe right hand are pleaſures for euermore.
               
               It is true indeed that we are perfect in this life in two reſpects. Firſt, in regard of the perfection of parts, becauſe (like in
                     •
                  ants) we haue all the parts of a chriſtian: God hath giuen vs all his graces: though we haue thē not in their full perfection. And ſecondly wee are reputed perfect in Chriſt our head, being clothed with his perfect righteouſneſſe. And for this cauſe the Cant. 4.1 Cant. 6.3.8 9. 
                  Church is ſayed to be

                  faire, beautifull, comly, vndefiled, and pure; to wit, becauſe ſhe is inueſted in the ſpotleſſe and pure robes of Chriſts abſolute & moſt meritorious holineſſe and obedience, which is imputed to her, and accepted as her owne. But if we ſpeake of the perfection of ſanctification or of inherent holineſſe, we muſt needes confeſſe that we are not perfect, but that we ariſe like a houſe by degrees, and do Epheſ. 2 21. 
                  grow till we be compleat. Which ſhall not be till death, which endeth the battell betwixt the fleſh and the ſpirit, vtterly conſuming all the corruptions of our corrupted nature.
               
                   Againe, as fields are ſubiect to be
annoyed and waſted: and as there is no field without ſome hurtfull or improfitable thing in it, as ſtones, weeds and ſuch like: ſo Gods field is ſubiect to be waſted and infeſted. Therefore the Pſa. 94.5 
                  Pſalmiſt ſaith, that the wicked ſmite downe Gods people, and trouble his heritage. And Saul 
                  Act 8, 3. before his conuerſion is ſayed to waſte the

Church of God. And there is in ou
                     •
                   hearts (that are her children) many ſinnes, which are not as yet exi
                     •
                  e
                     •
                  , being noyſome vnto vs, as weede and ſtones are to a corne field. And againe, as there is no houſe, that is not obnoxious to ſome danger, either by violence of fire, or by the inundati
                  
                     •
                  n of waters, or through inflammation by lightning, or elſe by reaſon of impetuous windes & ſtormy tempeſts, beſides the ſubiection, wherein it is of it ſelfe to fall to ruine, being compoſed of things that are corruptible. Euen ſo Gods Church on earth, is ſubiect in herſelfe (being Cant. 1.4 
                  black with ſinne, and vnmundified here in part) to ruines and rotten errours, both mentall and morall. Beſides, ſhee is ſubiect to many perils from without. Sathan with his inſtruments play their parts againſt her continually. Sometimes hee ſallies vpon her by force like a Lion, raiſing vp cruell tyrants to perſecute & vex her. Sometimes he ſets vpon her by fraud like a Leopard, approching to

her either with his Syrenian ſongs, or with his Crocodilian teares, or with a treacherous kiſſe, as Iudas did vnto his Maiſter; aſſaulting her with the ſubtill and ſophiſticall inuentions & engines of Heretikes, and attempting to violate her chaſtity by the pleaſing allurements, and witching enchantments of the world; who with her whoriſh eye, and two naked painted breaſts of pleaſures and profits, doth ſeeke to inueigle our hearts and make vs yeeld vnto her.
               Thus Sathan meetes her vpon the ſtage of this world, and enters combat with her, vſing all meanes to preuaile againſt her; ſometimes purſuing her with the flouds of perſecution, ſometimes kindling in her the coales of contention, ſometimes ſeeking to ouercome her with ſecret machinations, and with faire ſpeeches, & fraudulent perſwaſions, and ſomtimes alſo ſtriuing to daunt her with the dreadfull menacies of the great men of the world, and neuer ceaſeth practiſing againſt her; but all in vaine.

For Mat. 16, 18 
                  the gates of hell (ſaith Chriſt) euen ſathan and all his ſtrength and ſtratagems ſhall not preuaile againſt her to vanquiſh and ſubdue her.
               
                   Finally, ſome things may be in a field which are not of the field, as toades, frogges and ſuch like: a wolfe may bee in the ſame field and fold wherein a company of ſheepe are: the enemy with his 
                     •
                  ares may be in a field as well as the right owner of it, and his good ſeed, and good ſets. Euen ſo if we regard the viſible and externall face of the Church, prophane perſōs & very reprobats may be in her, albeit they be not of her. They are but as frogges, toades, nettles, bryars, and crowes in a corne-field: or as Wolues and Foxes and madde dogges in a fold or flocke of ſheepe: or elſe as ſtones and weeds, which trouble and hinder the good corne.
               
                   And againe, as in a field we ſee ſets, hearbs and ſeeds oftentimes brought into a field, & ſet & ſown in it, which do not naturally come vp of themſelues

in it: euen ſo God doth ſet the plants of his Spirit, and ſow the ſeeds of his ſanctifying graces in our hearts which otherwiſe would neuer ſpring vp within vs of themſelues, and by the vertue of our nature.
               
                   And as euery field ſtands in neede
of dreſſing and keeping, and requires wholeſome aire, ſweete ſhewers, and the comfortable heate of the Sunne. Euen ſo the Church ſtands in need of husbanding: ſhe hath neede of the heauenly dewe of Gods graces, and of the ſweet light and heate of the Sunne of righteouſneſſe, and that the Northerne and Southerne windes of Gods Spirit ſhould Cant. 4.16 
                  blow vpon her, that her ſpices and her fruits might flow out and come forth abundantly. In like manner alſo, as euery houſe ſtands in need of ſome ſhilter and reparation, ſo doth Gods houſe. For we lye open to wind and water, and haue the ruines of our depraued nature ſtill remaining in vs. And as the Houſholder brings many thing into his houſe which he finds not in it: euen

ſo the Lord inſpireth many good things into our hearts, which he finds not in vs, and which we want by nature. And as ſome things may be in the houſe which are not of the houſe, as rats, miſe, weaſils, yea and treacherous and theeuiſh perſons. Euen ſo (if wee conſider the outward appearance and name of the Church, which is Gods houſe) ſome may be in it, which belong not to it, and are not truly of it. Therefore Ioh. 2.1
                        •
                     . 
                  Iohn ſaith; they went out of vs, but they were not of vs. Antichriſt that man of ſinne and ſonne of perdition, ſits in the Temple of God, but not as a member of it, but as a cruell and proud Tyrant, tyrannizing in it; as a Theefe in a true mans houſe, as a Pyrate in a Merchants ſhip, or as a Wolfe and Fox in a ſheepfold. And in a word, as ſome things may be brought into a field, and planted in it, which as yet are not: & as ſome may be brought into an houſe and made ſeruants in it, which for the preſent are not: euen ſo ſome may be brought into Gods Church, which

is his pleaſant field and the palace of his pleaſure, and may bee made her true members and faithful houſhold-ſeruants, which as yet wander abroad and are not effectually called home. And thus wee ſee the reſemblance, that is betwixt a field or houſe, and the Church of God. Now ſhe is called Gods Husbandry and Gods building, becauſe hee hath taken her to himſelfe and incloſed her, hee doth husband and order her: he doth build and repaire her: he doth poſſeſſe & keepe her: and becauſe he doth inhabite and worke within her. And albeit ſhe may be fitly compared to a field and houſe in the forenamed reſpects, yet in other regards ſhe is vnlike vnto them. For God is her only Lord & owner, & for his honour only he hath ordained her. And whereas houſes and fields are bought with money, ſhe was purchaſed neither by gold nor ſiluer, but by the Act. 20.28. 1 Pet. 1.18 19. 
                  bloud of God, euen by the precious heart-bloud of that immaculate Lambe Chriſt Ieſus, who is true Rom 9.5. 
                  God & true

                  1 Tim. 2.5 
                  Man in one perfect perſon. Thirdly, all houſes and fields are ſubiect to vtter and finall deſolation. And the day ſhall come, wherein the 2, Pet. 3.10. earth, and all the workes therein ſhall be conſumed with fire. But the Church of GOD ſhall ſtand for euer. And when all the glory of the world ſhall vaniſh quite away, like a flaſh of fire: and when all her deſperate, malicious and irreconciliable enemies ſhall vtterly be deſtroyed, then ſhall ſhe ſhine as the Sunne, and obtaine her perfect glory, and liue for euer with the Lord in all eaſe and happineſſe, free from all ſinfull and earthly miſeries whatſoeuer. Fourthly, wheras all other fields and houſes are materiall, outward and earthly: this field and this houſe is myſticall, celeſtiall and 1 Pet 2, 5, 
                  ſpirituall: and may bee ſo called in all theſe regards enſuing. Firſt becauſe the Spirit of God doth husband her and dwell in her. Secondly, becauſe her whole frame is ſpirituall, & her chiefeſt ornamēts are inward and inuiſible. Pſa 45.13 
                  The kings daughter

is all glorious within, ſaith the Pſalm.
               Thirdly, the meanes which God vſeth for her building, repairing, trimming, flouriſhing and c
                     ••
                  tinuing, are not earthly but ſpirituall, and of a nature far differing from worldly helps, and humane inuentions. Fourthly, the ſeruice and worſhip, which ought to be performed in her, is ſpirituall. And laſtly all the good workes, which ſhe doth, are ſpirituall. All the good workes, which we, or any of her faithfull members do performe, are meerely good ſo far forth as they do proceed from the Spirit of God, who is goodneſſe it ſelfe, and the author of all our goodneſſe. And the euill which is in them commeth from our owne home-bred corruptition, which is not in this life cleanſed cleane away, vnleſſe it be becauſe it is forgiuen vs, and not imputed to vs.
               And to conclude; the Church is ſaid to be a field & an houſe, not fields and houſes. For the Church is but one body, one perfect houſe, and one
                  
entire and abſolute field. She hath but one Lord, one Architect, one Redeemer, one abſolute Husbandman and Inhabitant, one common ſaluation, one religion, one Head, one Husband, one way to heauen; according to that of S
                  Epheſ. 4.4. 
                  Paul, There is one body, one Spirit, one faith, one Lord, one baptiſme, one God and father. And this hath alſo been the doctrine of former ages.
               
                  Theodoretus ſaith (queſt. 44. in Num.) As the Vnicorne hath one horne, ſo the people truly religious adoreth one onely God. And for the vnity of her head,In Pſ. paeni

                  Gregory ſaith, that The whole holy vniuerſal Church is on Body, ſet vnder Chriſt Ieſus as her Head. For Chriſt with his whole Church, both militant & triumphant, is one perſon. Nazianzene ſaith;Orat. in d. Eu, Vbi ſupra. 
                  There is one Chriſt, one head of the Church. Thirdly, concerning the vnity of the Spirit, Gregory ſaith that, As there is one ſoule, which doth quicken the diuerſe members of the body, ſo one Holy Spirit doth quicken and illuſtrate the whole Church. Fourthly for the vnity of faith and outward confeſſion,

                  Eucherius ſaith that,In l. Reg. As a bundle is bound with bands, ſo all the company of the Saints are bound together with one and the ſame faith, hope and charity, & compaſſed with one muniment of diuine protection.

                  there is one oriſon, and one confeſſion of the whole Church. Finally touching the vnity of Baptiſme; There is one faith (ſaith Hierome) & one Baptiſme. And ſo withall for the vnitie of her God, Iuſtinus ſaith, There is one true God of all, which is acknowledged in the Father, Sonne, and holy Spirit. Our faith (ſaith Cyril) receiueth no number of Gods,

               Hauing now opened the words, and giuen the ſenſe, let vs ſee what leſſons we may learne out of them.
            
            
               
               CHAP. 2. The Church of God is Gods houſe and husbandry.
               
                  
                     Doct. 1
                  THESE wordes do naturally without wreſting affoord vs two notable doctrins. The former is that the true church of God (which is the cōpany of Beleeuers) is Gods Houſe and Husbandry. This is plaine by the text, as alſo by other like places of Scripture. 1 Cor. 3.16. 
                  Know ye not (ſaith Paul) that ye are the Temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? And ſpeaking to Timothy he ſaith; 1 Tim. 3 14.15. 
                  Theſe things I write, that thou maiſt know how to behaue thy ſefe in Gods Houſe, which is the Church of the liuing God. And plaine reaſon ſheweth as much. For it is not her owne: ſhe is not the Lady of her ſelfe. 1 Cor. 6 19. 
                  Ye are not your owne (ſaith Paul) for ye are bought for a price. Neither is the Church a tenement or poſſeſſion belonging to any Angell, or to any Man,
                  
excepting onely the man Chriſt who is the Mal. 3.1. Epheſ. 5.23 Iude. 4, 
                  Angell of the couenant and her only Lord & Head. She is not the field of the ſluggard, which Pro. 24.30. 
                  Salomon ſpeaks of. She is not the houſe of wickedneſſe and ſinne. For Epheſ. 5.26. Reu. 1.5. 
                  Chriſt gaue himſelfe for her, that hee might make her holy, and purge her from her ſinnes with his bloud. Therefore he ſaith vnto her; Cant, 4.7. 
                  Thou art all faire, my loue, and there is no ſpot in thee. Neither is ſhee the houſe and field of the Diuell. For Chriſt hath purchaſed her Epheſ, 5.27. 
                  vnto himſelfe. Therefore ſhe ſaith; My Cant, 2, 16, and 7, 10, welbeloued (meaning Chriſt) is mine, and I am his. I am my welbeloueds, and his deſire is towards me. And Chriſt ſpeaking vnto her▪ cals her his 
                  Cant, 4, 1 9, 
                  loue, his ſiſter▪
                   & his ſpouſe; therefore ſurely the Liuell hath no intereſt in her, and no title to her. The concluſion then remaineth firme, that as the Temple of Ieruſalem was dedicated to be an houſe vnto the Lord alone, euen ſo the Church is built and conſecrated vnto him only, that ſhe may be his Houſe to dwel in, & as a field to husband & diſpoſe of,

as he in his wiſedome ſeeth moſt conuenient. Thus much for the doctrine, let vs now ſe how we may apply it for our benefite and edification.
            
            
               CHAP. 3. Sundry vſes are made of the conſideration of theſe two titles together.
               
                  THe vſes, which we ought to make of the former doctrine are of two ſorts Some ariſe from the conſideration of theſe 2 titles (giuē to the Church) together: & ſome frō them being cōſidered apart by themſelues.Vſe. 1. Of the former company are theſe that follow.
               Firſt, we haue here one of the roialties and royall priuiledges of the faithfull. For they, and they onely (to ſpeake properly) are Gods houſe & husbandry. For the Father hath elected them only: the Son hath redeemed them onely: the holy Ghoſt doth

regenerate them onely. God (the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt) doth dwell in them onely, in regard of the preſence of his ſpeciall grace, and efficatious operation vnto eternall life. For as concerning the Reprobates, they are the very ſinks of ſin, the dennes of the Diuell, and the quagmyres of iniquity, Pro. 16.4 predeſtinated to eternall diſtruction. Some of them (I confeſſe) may thinke themſelues to be of Gods houſe, and to belong vnto his field: but their imagination is like the fond and falſe conceipt of ſome Melancholique perſons, that haue thought their bodies to haue beene made of glaſſe, and that euery faire houſe was theirs, which they paſſed by. Yea they may perſwade themſelues ſo thereof, as that they may cō
                  ceiue a kind of ioy therefore in their hearts, and yet for all they are deceiued. Some that haue ſuddenly fallen into a ſwoone haue imagined that they ſaw goodly ſights: and many frantick perſons will ſing and hallo, as if they were in a very good condition

whereas indeed their caſe is pittifull. Euen ſo ſome of the Reprobate may fall into ſuch a fit of ſpirituall ſwoone and phantaſtick phrenſie of the mind, as that they may both think better of their eſtates then they are indeed, and reioyce alſo within themſelues, as if they were right good men and happy; being neuertheleſſe in truth the very Refuſe of mankind, the Obiects of Gods wrath, and (as it were) the Center of his iudgements. Yea further they may ſo carry themſelues outwardly, as that they may ſeeme vnto men (that doe not ſee the heart) the true mēbers of the Church, and as plants in Gods fi
                     •
                  ld. But blazing ſtarres are not true ſtarres, but fading meteores: a foot of wood is not a foot indeed: and painted fire is not fire. Euen ſo what ſhew ſoeuer they make, yet are they not indeede her members, they are not GODS plants indeed. They may be in Gods houſe, but they are not of Gods houſe: they may be in his field, but they are not of his field. Goates and ſheepe

may be together in one fold, though they be not of one flocke. Cockle & good come may bee in one Barne; Theeues and True men may be in one field: ſtrangers and ſeruants, gueſts and children in one houſe. And all is not that which it ſeemes to be. All is not graſſe that looketh greene, nor all bloud that is red. Sathan can tranſforme himſelfe into an Angel of light:2 Cor. 11.14 all is not gold that gliſters: hypocrites may ſeeme religious, and men of woluiſh diſpoſitions can for need walke like ſheepe, in ſheepe-skins. When the great Gold-ſmith ſhal come to try them with his Touch-ſtone, hee will finde them copper, and not good gold. When the windes ſhall blow hard againſt them, when the flouds ſhall come and daſh againſt them, they ſhall fall flatte downe to the ground, becauſe they are not as liuing ſtones founded vpon the rock Chriſt, but weakly built vpon a weake and ſandy foundation. And a day will come when the Husbandman will view his field, and will ſeparate the

corne of his owne ſowing (and carry it home into his barne) from the tares of the enemy, how faire and freſh ſoeuer they ſeeme to be, and will binde them in a bundle, and caſt them into the fire.
               Now this prerogatiue is not meerly tit

                  ball, but very commodious, comfortable and excellent. For Chriſt Cant. 8.13. dwelleth in this field: the Spirit of God dwelleth in this houſe Iſa▪ 33.24 and they that dwell therein ſhal haue their iniquity forgiuen. And whoſoeuer are of this houſe, of this field, ſhall continue ſo for euer. For the Ier. 32.4 
                  couenant of God made with them is euerlaſting. The Rom. 11 29. 
                  gifts and the calling of God are giuen without repentance: and he wil 1 Pe

                   which is the Church, ſhall alwaies be the palace and paradiſe of his delight. He will carry her vpon his backe like an Eagle, he will ſhadow her with the wings of his grace, and will continue conſtant in his loue for

euer. For his Ier. 31.3 Pſa. 136.1, 
                  loue vnto her is euerlaſting, and his mercy endureth for euer.
               
               Secondly,Vſe 2. ſeeing the Church is Gods Houſe and Husbandry, ſhee muſt acknowledge no Lord, no Head, no King but God. Her obedience, her homage, her loyalty, her virginity belongs to him, as to her ſoueraigne Lord and onely abſolute Husband. She is not her owne; therefore ſhee muſt glorifie God, to whom of right ſhe doth pertaine.
               Thirdly,Vſe 3. Miniſters ought to be the more diligent, faithfull and alacrious in the execution of their function. For the labour which they take, and the paines they do beſtow, are beſtowed vpon Gods Houſe, vpon Gods plowed-field. They labour not in mens fields, not in the houſe of men, but in the houſe and field of almighty God (who is able to recompence the faithfull, and to puniſh the vnfaithfull:) therefore they ſhould be the more carefull, circumſpect & laborious in their calling, taking heed what ſeede

they ſow, what plants they ſet, and both what, and how they build.
               
                  Vſe 4.Fourthly, ſeeing the Church of God is his field & houſe, we ought all to labour to be aſſured that we are of it. For out of it there is no ſaluation. And when we are in it, we muſt keep our ſelues in it, and not ſtraggle out and leaue it. Men take grear delight to dwell in faire houſes, and to walke in pleaſant fields. The Church of God is a goodly houſe, and a pleaſant and greene field. Cant. 1.15 
                  My welbeloued, behold, thou art faire and pleaſant: alſo our bed is greene: the beames of our houſe are cedars.
                  Cant. 4.10. & 8.13 Chriſt delighteth and dwelleth in her. Let vs therefore like her, and loue to liue within her. They that leaue her, leaue him. For he is her Husband and Inhabitant: therefore ſhe cals him her Can
                        •
                     . 7.11 
                  Welbeloved: and he cals her his Spouſe: Cant. 4.12. 
                  My ſpouſe is a garden incloſed. And ſhe crying out vnto him ſaith thus:Cant. 8.13. Cant. 4.15
                  O thou that dwelleſt in the gardens. O fountain of the gardens, O well of liuing waters! So then he which forſakes her, forſakes him,

He which leaues her, leaues his garden: and he which leaues him, leaues her fountaine: euen the welſpring of her life, and the ſcaturidge of all true comfort. Let vs therfore keepe our ſelues within the borders of the Church, leſt we walke in the valley of death. We muſt needes be either in Gods Temple, or in the diuels Synagogue: either in Gods field or in the diuels field. And whenſoeuer wee ſee the face of a true Church in any place, let vs take heed that we do rend not our ſelus frō her, and leape out. For this were (ſo much as lay in vs) to runne out of Gods field, and to runne away from Chriſt, who frequenteth the Cant. 1.6.7. 
                  flockes of his ſheep, and delighteth to be in the aſſemblies of his people. Let vs therefore be wiſe, and not forſake the fellowſhip (or Heb 10.25. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  aggregation) that we haue among our ſelues, as the manner of ſome is: but let vs exhort one another, & that ſo much the more, becauſe ye ſee that the day (of Chriſts ſecond coming) draweth neare. Iude makes it a property of

thoſe that were fleſhly & had not the Spirit (what ſhew ſoeuer they made) to be Iude, 19. 
                  makers of ſects; men of a ſchiſmaticall and contradictorious ſpirit, that like not the beaten way, but loue to walke in a way by themſelues, though it be full of mud and mire.
               
                  Vſe 5.Conſidering alſo that the Church is Gods houſe & husbandry, it were a worke beſeeming the honour of Princes and all Potentates, in all their territories and dominions to defend and foſter her: that ſo they may verifie that ancient prophec
                     •
                   recorded by the prophet Eſay, that Iſa. 49.23 
                  kings should be her nurſing fathers, and that queenes should be her nurces. Yea it beſeemes vs all to be kinde vnto her, and to honour her. For ſhe is our mother. She is the houſe in which we are bred, and borne, and brought vp. She is the field in which we are planted and receiue our growth. Men loue the houſe wherein they were borne, and trained firſt vp, and the place in which they drew their firſt breath, and led the beginning of their

life. Let vs therefore loue the Church of God: let vs deſire and ſeeke her welfare.Pſa, 122, 6 7.

without griefe of heart? We looke to our owne gardens and orchards; let vs not therfore caſt off al care of Gods, but let vs rather labour to the vtmoſt of our power (keeping vs within the precinct of our calling) that they may flouriſh & proſper in the world. And ſo doing we ſhall teſtify our loue to God and his Church: we ſhall ſhew our ſelues to be true natural ſons and not baſtards: ſeruants and not ſlaues: faithfull friends, and not fawning flatterers and falſe-hearted foes.
               
                  Vſe 6.Sixtly, ſeeing the Church is Gods field and houſe, we may be ſure that God will husband and repaire her. He will till and dreſſe her: he will pluck out her weeds & make her fertile: he will manure, and water her with the firſt and latter raine of his gracious benediction. He will cauſe the North-wind to blow vpon her, which ſhall purify the aire about her, & pinch the luxuorious humors within her, & coole the pride of her hart, & the exceſſiue heat of her ſpirit. He will alſo ſend out the South-wind to cōfort

her with his warme blaſts, and to water her with his ſweet ſhewers, that ſhe may be freſh and fruitfull. Pſa 147.8 
                  The Lord (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) couereth the heauen with clouds, and prepareth raine for the earth, and maketh the graſſe to grow vpon the mountaines. Euen ſo the Lord couereth the Church with his loue, he cauſeth the clouds to breake, he powreth downe the raine of his bleſſing vpon her; he moyſtens her with the dew of heauen, and maketh his graces to ſprout vp and flouriſh within her. Yea he maketh her (like dry ground) to thirſt after the waters of life: and teacheth her to cry out and ſay;Cant. 4.19. 
                  Ariſe O North, and come O South, and blow vpon my garden, that the ſpices thereof may flow out. And forſomuch as ſhe is his houſe, we may know for certaine, that he will in time remoue in-bred ruines and rottenneſſe, and wil repaire and poliſh her, til he haue made her perfect & glorious in all reſpects. And albeit he do often ſuffer her faithfull and true members to bring forth the weedes of ſin, and to

fall into the ruines of wickedneſſe; yet it is not through his negligence & obliuion, or bcauſe he hath caſt them off: but it is to teach them to diſtaſt their pride, and to confeſſe that they can eaſily fall of themſelues, but are vnable to ſtand, or riſe vp without him. The husbandman ſometimes lets his ground lie as if he had forſaken it, and can be for a time content to ſee it growne with weeds. But he hath a purpoſe to breake it vp with his plough, and to beſtow more coſt vpon it, that it may be more fruitfull, then before. He will not ſee it ouer-grown with weeds: he wil not permit thē to ſuck out the heart, & to make it altogether barrē
                  ▪ & good for nothing. So likewiſe we ſee many men ſuffer their houſes to decay, & for a while to fall to ruine: but their intent is to build them fairer, and to make them ſtronger then they were before. And thus God ſometimes dealeth with his faithfull ſeruants, as with David, Hezekiah, Peter and others. For he is tied by no law to preſerue any man longer

then he liſt. And ſo great is his grace vnto vs, as that if he ſuffer vs to fall, yet he will not let vs fall quite a way, but will in due ſeaſon reſtore and lift vs vp againe. For Semel et ſemper, Once and euer are all one with God: whom he hath embraced once, he will embrace Ier 32.40 for euer.

                  Sauiour of all men▪ but eſpecially of thoſe that beleeue. He forſaketh not his Saints (ſaith Dauid) they

                  ſhall be preſerued for euermore. Though they fall, yet ſhall they not be caſt off, for the Lord putteth vnder his hand to lift them vp againe. Men, when they ſee their houſes weake, &

expoſed to wind and weather, do vſe to vnderprop them, & to plant trees about them to defend them. Euen ſo vndoubtedly the Lord being priuy to our weakeneſſe doth ſupport vs with the props of his grace, and doth enuiron vs with the tall and ſtrong Cedars of his power. For Pſa. 147.11. 
                  he taketh delight in them that feare him, and attend vppon his mercy. He will neuer turne from them to do them good. Ier. 33.11. 
                  Yea (ſaith the Lord) I will delight in them to do them good. We may not thinke that God will bee careleſſe of his houſe, if forgetfull man be carefull of his. In like manner alſo wiſe & thrifty husbands ſeeing their fields ſubiect to be waſted with cattell, and their corne to be troden downe and eaten vp, do vſe to compaſſe them with pales or other fences, & to ouerſee them. Euen ſo the Lord doth incloſe his Church, and ouerſee her for her good, and is exceeding viligant ouer her. He taketh the Foxes, which marre his vines: he killeth the Boares: he driueth out the beaſts: he mendeth

her hedges: he repaireth her ditches. and hath a ſpeciall care that his corne, his vines, and plants be not tooted vp & ſpoiled. If men reſpect their fields ſo diligently, it were horrible wickedneſſe for any man to imagine that God will neglect his; eſpecially conſidering that he payd ſo deerely for it as he did, & conſidering alſo he is able to keepe it ſafe without toile or wearineſſe, and is not ſubiect to forgetfulneſſe.
               Eightly, Vſe. 8. ſeeing the Church is Gods field and houſe, we ought in no caſe to wrong her nor any of her members. For the iniury that is offered vnto her, doth redound vnto him, and he accounteth all the wronges as done vnto himſelfe, which are done by their enimies vnto them. Iſa. 63.9. 
                  In all their troubles he is troubled: and Zach. 2.8 
                  they that touch them (to do them harme) do touch the very apple of his eye. It were a diſhoneſt and wicked part in any man to ſpoile his neighbours field, or to pull downe or ſet fire on his houſe; what horrible wickedneſſe then is it

for any man to fire Gods houſe, & to waſte and make hauock in his field? If 
                  1. Cor. 3.17. 
                  any man ſhall deſtroy the Temple of God, him ſhal God deſtroy. For the Temple of God (ſaith Paul) is holy, which ye are. The Church of GOD is a citty

                  ſought out, and not forſaken of the Lord. He hath clothed her with the garments of ſaluatiō, he hath couered her with the robe of righteouſneſſe; and as a bride doth tire her ſelfe with her iewels, ſo doth the Lord adorne her with his graces, and put the golden chaine of immortality about her necke. Now dareſt thou oppoſe thy ſelfe againſt her, on whom God hath beſtowed ſo great coſt? Wilt thou maligne her whom he doth loue, and in his loue hath choſen to himſelfe? Wil the Iſa. 60.16.

Chriſt Ieſus? Haſt thou none to perſecute, none to maligne, none to trouble but him, that dyed that thou mighteſt liue & not dye? What none? If thou wilt needs perſecute & ſpoile, then perſecute thine owne corruptions, ſpoile them, make hauocke of thy luſts, 1. Pet. 2.11.

How oft ſhall the candle of the wicked be put out? They ſhall be as ſtubble before the wind, & as chaffe that the ſtorme carrieth away. Therefore partake not with them in their ſins▪ leſt thou be partaker of their puniſhments. Trouble not Gods people, do not annoy his field, take heed thou perſecute not his Church. For ſhee ſhall be a cup of poiſon vnto all that hate her▪ and an heauy ſtone to all her enimes. All that lift it vp ſhall be torne; though all the people of the earth be gathered together againſt it, God will not ſuffer his Turtle doue to be taken, his Church to be deſtroyed. Therefore as Mat. 27 19. 
                  Pilats wife ſent word vnto him concerning Chriſt, ſaying; Haue thou nothing to do with that iuſt man: ſo ſay I to thee concerning Chriſt his Church, and, all

He loues them deerely, & keeps them very carefully.

Many men in pitty will not ſpoile a ground or garden for the plants that are in it, becauſe of their goodneſſe and comely order. The Church of God is as a field or garden. Her plants are as an Cant. 4 12.13. 
                  Orchard of Fomegranats with ſweet fruits, as Camphire, Spikenard, Saffran, Calamus, and Cinamon

Cinamon with all the trees of incenſe, Myrre & Aloes, with all the chiefe ſpices. God hath greatly graced al her members, & hath ſet al her plants in a comly order; let vs therefore ſpare them, & not ſpoile them: let vs not harme and annoy them. The Church is a faire and ſumptuous building: yea ſhe is a Iſa. 62.3. 
                  crowne of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royall diademe in the hand of her God. And dare man maligne her? Shall the ſonne of man whoſe breath is in his noſtrils, ſeeke to fire her, or pull her downe? Let them beware they do not. For otherwiſe the Lord will fan them, the wind ſhal carry them away, and the whirlewind of his wrath ſhall ſcatter them: they ſhall be burnt with the flames of their owne fire, and compaſſed about with their owne ſparkles. If a man ſhould breake into thy fields, and make ſpoile amongſt thy corne: or if he ſhould beat downe thy houſe, or fire it ouer thine head, maiſt thou not iuſtly be offended, & ſue him at the law for his iniury done vnto thee? There is no queſtion

to be made: the caſe is cleare. And ſhal we thinke that God will be ſilent and ſay nothing to thoſe, that would ſpoile his field, that treade downe his corne, that cut downe his plants, that breake open his hedges, that annoy his houſe, and feeke to fire it ouer his head? Vndoubtedly except they repent and alter their courſe in time, the Lord will arreſt them, he will arraine them at the barre of his iuſtice, he will pleade againſt them, and condemne them. For if the ſentence of death ſhal be pronounced againſt thē 
                  Mat. 25. that ſhewed no kindneſſe to his ſeruants; what can we thinke ſhall be the end of thoſe but death ineuitable, which haue bene malicious, cruell and iniurious vnto them? Let vs therfore take heed that we do not hate & perſecute the Church of God, nor any of her children. She is Gods field: ſhe is Gods houſe: this is reaſon ſufficient to diſſwade vs from all ſecret and open machinations againſt her, though we had no other reaſon in the world beſides.
               
                  
                  Vſe. 9.Ninthly, ſeeing that the Church is Gods houſe and husbandry, we need not maruell that the diuell doth ſo maligne and moleſt her.

                  hat belong vnto him, to whom he doth in ſpeciall manner confer and manifeſt his grace. And hence it is alſo that ſhe hath in all ages receiued hard meaſure of the world, & that the wicked of the world do perſecute & ſtorme againſt her members; euen becauſe ſhe is Gods field & habitation, and therefore is not of the world, but a ſtranger in the world, belonging to another kingdome and commonwealth. It is the faſhion of Dogges to barke at ſtrangers; it is no wonder then that the Dogges of this world do barke at her and fly in her face: it is no maruell though they bite her children, and baulle at them. For they are ſtrangers to them. They are not of them, but among them. They are not

caſt in one mould together, nor made of one mettall. Foxes are by nature giuen to murder Lambs: and Boares are naturally carried to make hauocke in a vineyard, and to ſpoile the vines.

Beaſts are giuen to breake hedges, to leape ouer ditches, and to ſpoile yong plants, & to treade downe corne.

But feare not, thou worme Iacob, and ye men of Iſrael. I will helpe thee, ſaith the Lord. 
                  Pſa 55.22 
                  Caſt thy burthen vpon the Lord, and he ſhall nouriſh thee. The wicked that are ſtrangers and enimies

                  he will ſurely puniſh. He will breake their teeth, and crack their iawes. They ſhall melt like ice, and conſ

                  me like ſnailes. He will carry them away, as with a whirlewind in his wrath. Pſa. 55.23 
                  Thou, O God, ſhalt bring them downe into the pit of corruption: the bloody and deceiptfull men ſhall not liue out halfe their daies.
               
               
                  Vſe 10.Finally, ſeeing we are Gods field & building, we are al taught to loue one another. We are not two houſes, but one: we are not two fields, but one. And therfore as one, we ought to loue and embrace one another. It were a prodigious ſight to ſee one ſtone in a building to iuſtle with another. We are as 1 Pet▪ 2.5 
                  Liuing ſtones in Gods ſpirituall building: let vs therefore by loue lie cloſe by one another: let vs not iuſtle one another. If an houſe be deuided againſt it ſelfe, how ſhall it ſtand? We are Gods houſe & houſhold-ſeruants: therefore we muſt not be diuided againſt our ſelues, leſt his houſe fall downe vpon our heads. Diuiſion is

a forerunner of deſtruction. Therefore as one ſtone in a building beareth vp another, ſomtimes a little one bearing a greater, and ſometime the greater bearing a leſſer: euen ſo let vs beare vp and beare with one another: let vs not fly out of the wall: let vs not ſtomacke & enuy one another, alwaies remembring that we are the ſtones of one building, and all laid by one Maiſter-maſon. Corne in one field, plants in one Orchard, trees in one wood, flowers in one garden, and vines in one vineyard, do grow together without moleſting and hindring one another. They ſtand together without diſcontentment: they ſhroud and harbour one another. We are the corne of Gods field, the plants of his orchard, the trees of his wood, the flowers of his garden, and the vines of his vineyard: and therefore we ſhould ſtand together without contempt & diſcontentmēt: & we ought to ſhroud and ſhilter one another. Now 
                  Col. 
                        •
                     .8.12. 
                  therefore as the elect of God, holy and beloued, put on the bowels of mercy,

kindneſſe, humility, meekeneſſe, long ſuffering. Put away wrath, anger, malice, curſing: and hate not one another. 
                  1 Ioh. 7 11. 
                  For he that hateth his brother, is in darkenes. But let vs loue one another, for 
                  1 Ioh. 4.7. 
                  loue cō
                     meth of God, and euery, one that loueth, is borne of God. Wouldeſt thou know that thou art in the ſtate of life? Then loue thy brethren. We know (ſaith Ioh. 3.14 
                  Iohn) that we are tranſlated from death to life, becauſe we loue the brethren: he that loueth not his brother, abideth in death. Wouldeſt thou know that thou loueſt God? Then loue the children of God. For 1 Io
                        •
                     . 5.1 
                  euery one which loueth him, that did beget, loueth him alſo, which is begotten of him. Wouldeſt thou abide in the true light? Then loue thy brother. For 1 Ioh. 2.10 
                  he that loueth his brother, abideth in the light, & there is none occaſion of euill in him. Wouldeſt thou be like the Lord that did beget thee? Then loue; for 1 Ioh. 4.8. 
                  God is loue: Wouldeſt thou be obedient vnto God? Thē loue thy neighbour; for his Mat. 22.39. 
                  commandement is, that thou ſhouldeſt loue thy neighbor as thy ſelfe. Finally, wouldeſt thou

ſhew thy ſelfe a true diſciple of Chriſt thy Sauiour? Then loue thy fellowes For Ioh. 13.35. 
                  by this ſhall all men know (ſaith Chriſt) that ye are my diſciples, if ye haue loue one vnto another. Let vs therefore affect one another with true loue. We are the ſons of one father, the children of one mother, the tēple of one God, the field of one husbandman, the houſe of one inhabitant, the branches of one vine, the ſtones of one bilding, and the plants of one field; let vs therfore keepe peace with our ſelues, & embrace one another in the armes of amity. So ſhall Gods houſe continue, his throne ſhall endure, his field ſhall proſper, we our ſelues ſhall flouriſh, our ioys ſhall be increaſed, and our enimies ſhall be defeated of much aduantage.
               Thus much concerning the inſtructions which ariſe out of the conſideration of theſe two titles together. It remaineth now to ſet downe thoſe that may be gathered from thē, being diſtinctly conſidered by themſelues. And of the former firſt.
            
            
               
               CHAP. 4. We muſt keepe our ſelues wholly for God. We muſt be content with his husbanding. We muſt ſtriue to be fruitfull in good things. They are to be diſpraiſed that are barren.
               
                  FIrſt, forſomuch as we are GODS field,Vſe 1. we muſt beware that we giue not our ſelues to any from him, We are not our own to diſpoſe of as we liſt our ſelues, but his that hath bought vs, and taken vs in for himſelfe. Let vs therefore take heed that we ſuffer not our ſelues to be ſowne with corrupt ſeed, & to be ſet with the plants of wickedneſſe. Let not the diuell ſow the tares of wicked errours and filthy ſinnes within thee. Thou art Gods, keepe thy ſelfe cleane and pure for God.
               
               
                  Vſe 2.Secondly, ſeeing we are Gods field, let vs be content with his husbandnig of vs. The ground doth patiently

beare the Plowman and his Plow, the ſower and his ſeed without the leaſt reſiſtance. So let vs be content to beare with meekeneſſe, Gods plough and his ploughmen, his ſeed and ſowers. Let vs endure all things, which he hath in his wiſdome ordained to breake vs vp, & to make vs faire and fertile; his Word, his Sacraments, his Miniſters, his Orders. Let vs not repine and ſtorme againſt them, but ſubiect our ſelues, and beare them meekely without reſiſſtance.Vſe. 3.
               
               Thirdly, we are taught to be fruitful vnto God in faith, loue, repentance, and obedience. The good ground, which receiueth good ſeed, is very profitable to the owner, ſending forth plenty of fruit. Euē ſo we being ſowen with the good and wholeſome ſeed of Gods word, we ought to bring forth fruit aboundantly, that our owner may haue a plentiful crop. It is a curſed ground that receiues ſeed, & yet affoordeth either nothing or nought but weedes. We are Gods

field, a
                     •
                  d therefore we ſhould not be like the field of the Pro. 24.31. 
                  ſluggard, that is ouergrowne with thornes & nettles. If a field be broken vp with the plough, and if good ſeed be not ſowen therein, it will bring forth more ſtore of weeds, then if it had laine vnplowed. So if the ſeeds of Chriſtian vertues be not ſowne in our heartes, and fructify in our liues now that we haue ben broken vp with the plough of Gods word, we ſhall more abound with the ſtinking weedes of wickedneſſe, then if we had neuer felt that plough. Let vs therefore looke to our ſelues, and labour to be fruitfull in good thing, Pro. 23.12. 
                  Apply thine heart to inſtruction, and thine eares to the words of knowledge. 
                  Pro. 21.21. 
                  He that followeth after righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhall find life, righteouſneſſe, and glory. Now that we may be fruitfull, we muſt performe theſe duties following.
               Firſt, we muſt roote thoſe ſinfull weedes out of our hearts, which oppreſſe and choke them. Ier. 4.4 
                  Breake vp your fallow ground, and ſow not among

the thornes, Be circumciſed to the Lord, and take away the foreskin of your hearts.
               
               Secondly, we muſt labour to be partakers of Gods word, hungring and thirſting after it, as after food. It is the Plough, that muſt breake vs vp: it is the beetle that doth beat our clotty hearts: it is the ſeed that muſt be ſcattered vpon them: and it is the raine alſo, that makes the ſeed ſpring vp and grow: It is the meanes; indeed the bleſſing is from the Lord. Pet. 2.1.2. 
                  Wherefore laying aſide all maliciouſnes, all guile, ſimulation, enuy, and all euill ſpeaking, as new borne babes deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.
               
               Thirdly, when the ſeed is ſowne, let it find roome within vs. Let vs giue it liberty to roote and ſpread it ſelfe in our heartes. As a ſhip cannot ſaile without ſea-roome: ſo the ſeed cannot grow without earth-roome. We muſt therefore giue the ſeed of Gods word roome in our heartes: we muſt yeeld vnto it, we muſt giue it paſſage in vs, we muſt locke it vp in

the cloſet of a faithfull heart, and beleeue it. The word hath bene Heb. 4.2. vnprofitable to many, becauſe it was not mixed in them with faith.
               Fourthly, we muſt not only heare the word, but we muſt let it worke in our liues, we muſt expreſſe it in our conuerſations. Be ye doers of the word, 
                  Iam. 1.22 
                  and not hearers onely only (ſaith Saint Iames) deceiuing your owne ſelues. For if any man heare the word, & do it not, he is like vnto a man, that beholdeth his naturall face in a glaſſe. For when he hath conſidered himſelfe, he goeth his way, and forgetteth immediately what manner of one he was. He that heares & does not, is like him, that eates and thriues not.
               Fiftly, becauſe the bleſſing commeth from aboue, we ought therefore earneſtly to begge a bleſſing of God vpon the knees of our ſoules, that his word may take deepe roote in our hearts downewards, and bring forth fruit plentifully in our liues vpwards; and that as the Sunne doth whiten cloth, reſolue the ſnow, melt the hardeſt

yee, and giue light vnto the world, ſo his word may melt our hearts, and whiten them; and ſo diſpell the darkeneſſe of our mindes, as that we may repent of all our ſins, and ſee the riches of his grace, and may haue light to come out of the waies of darkeneſſe, and to walke before him in the wayes of life.
               Sixtly, we ſhould ſet before our eyes that great reward, which God will beſtow vpon all ſuch as are fruitfull in good workes, and abound in the fruites of the Spirit. They ſhall haue heauen, & earth, and all things whatſoeuer are needfull and fitting for them. And the more they doe exceed in grace, the more they ſhall excell in glory.
               Seuenthly, we ought to conſider diligently the examples of Gods children, dead and aliue, that haue bene & are full of good fruits, good deeds, and who ſhine in Chriſtian graces before all other men: and hauing their patterns ſet before vs (as ſcholers haue their copies) we ſhould ſtir vp ourſelues

and ſtudy to reſemble them, yea & go before thē. Many mē thinke skorn that any ſhould go beyond thē in fooliſh faſhions, and vaine attire; wherefore then ſhould we be content through our droniſh & heauy diſpoſition that any ſhould ſtrip vs in the race of Chriſtianity, and be more plentiful and ranke in bearing the fruits of righteouſnes, then we our ſelues are? eſpecially conſidering that we haue the plough of Gods word, the ſeed of wholeſome doctrine, & the ſweet ſhewers of heauenly counſels, exhortations, admonitions, and dehortations, as plentifully among vs, as they haue amongſt them, and more plentifully too it may be. One man ſtriues to haue as good corne as another: why then ſhould not we labour to be as rich in grace as our brethren?
               Laſtly, if we would be fruitfull, we muſt beware of the cares of the world, that they do not like thornes choke the ſeed that is ſowen in vs, & ouerſhadow it. We muſt alſo take heed that it be not waſht away with

the waters of afflictions, & skorched with the burning heat of perſecutions. And finally we muſt take heed of the examples of the wicked, and that ſathan & the birds of hel do not ſteale it from vs, & pick it out of our hearts.
               Fourthly, thoſe are to be condemned,Vſe. 4. that take vpon them the name of Gods field or husbandry, and will needs be reputed his ſeruants; and yet are either barren as an heath, or fruitfull in nothing, but in the vnfruitful works of darknes; as drunkē
                  neſſe, ignorance, couetouſneſſe, malice, enuy, ſwearing, pride, idleneſſe, and vncleanneſſe. Heb. 6.7 8. 
                  The field that receiueth the raine, that fals often on it, and brings forth herbes fit for the husbandman, receiueth a bleſſing of God: but that which bringeth forth thornes & thiſtles, is reproued, and is neere a curſe: and the end of that field is burning. We are Gods field: his plough hath bene amongſt vs fifty yeares together, alwaies going vpon vs. His ſeed hath bene continually ſcattered vpon vs all this time. He hath watered vs richly with

the raine of heauenly inſtructions, and the Sunne of righteouſneſſe hath all this time ſhone vpon vs with his moſt glorious Goſpell. Now if we ſhall bring forth nothing (as too many do) but the thornes of iniquity, the thiſtles of vngodlineſſe, the nettles of fleſhly luſts, and the noiſome weeds of wickedneſſe, what can we looke for but a curſe? What do we elſe deſerue, but that he ſhould make vs deſolate as a deſert, and burne vs vp with the fire of his wrath? The Lord ſaid concerning his vineyard in Iudea, that becauſe he beſtowed much coſt vpon it, & it brought forth nothing but wild & ſowre grapes, 
                  Iſa. 5.5.6. he would take away the hedge thereof, and breake downe the wall. Yea, ſaith the Lord, I will lay it waſt: briars and thornes ſhall grow vp: it ſhall not be cut nor digged: I will alſo command the cloudes that they raine no raine vpon it. Wee are Gods Vineyard here in England: he hath hedged vs about: he hath built a tower, & made a wine-preſſe amongſt vs: he hath ſent his workemen among vs: he hath

enuironed vs with many outward bleſſings: he hath ſet watchmen to keepe vs: and he hath long expected good grapes, and a fruitfull vinetage. But alas, our grapes are generally ſowre and wild: our grapes are the grapes of gall, & our cluſters are bitter: our wine is the poiſon of Dragons, and the cruell gall of aſpes. Our ingratitude is great, our enormities are horrible, our wickedneſſe is abominable. We walke according to the ſtubborneneſſe of our harts: we haue made our browes of braſſe, and our foreheads of marble. We draw on ſin as it were with cart-ropes, & adde drunkennes vnto thirſt. Our dealings do teſtify as much to our faces. All the toile that hath bene taken with vs, doth ſeeme to be euen loſt in the moſt. The bellowes are burnt: the lead is conſumed in the fire: the founder melteth in vaine. The word of the Prophets is not regarded: the raine of their exhortations runs by vs▪ and is not receiued. And although we be continually dreſſed, & daily pruned

by the word of God as by a ſprittle or pruning knife, yet are we full of ſuperfluous branches, & our fruit is rotten, ſowre, vnwholeſome, & vnpleaſant. What may we now expect of God, if he ſhall deale with vs, as we haue dealt with him, but that he ſhould pull downe his hedge, breake downe his wal, and lay this vineyard waſte, and beſtow his paines vpon a people, that will bring forth better fruites? Let vs therefore repent before it bee too late: let vs labour againſt our barrenneſſe vnto good, & againſt our vnfruitfull▪ fruitfulneſſe in that which is euill. Shall we labour that our ſoile may be good and fertile, and ſhall we with patience ſee our ſoules ſterile & vnfruitfull? Can we not endure our gardens to be ouergrowne with weedes, and ſhall we ſuffer our heartes to be defaced with ſin, which is more ſtinking and infeſtant then any weed is, or can be? Shall we deſire God to giue vs the firſt and the latter raine to water our grounds, and ſhall we not pray him alſo to water the dry

ground of our hearts with the ſweet ſhewers of his graces, and to moiſten and ſoke vs with the water of his Spirit? Shal we deſire God to ſhew kindneſſe vnto vs in giuing vs the timely fruites of the yeare, and ſhall we be vnkind vnto him in keeping frō him the timely fruits of our hearts? Do we diſlike ſlerility in our groundes, & barrenneſſe in our ſheep and kine, & ſhall we not as wel diſlike the barrenneſſe of our hearts, and the ſpirituall ſterility of our ſoules? If we would ſhew our ſelues to be indeed the field of God, and would not ſhame his husbandmen, let vs ſtriue againſt our barrenneſſe: let vs lay aſide all the vnfruitfull works of darkeneſſe: and let vs labour to bring forth fruits in aboundance beſeeming repentance, and thoſe that profeſſe themſelues to be the field of the liuing God. And thus much for the firſt title.
            
            
               
               CHAP. 5. We ought to trim vp our ſelues. We may be ſure that God will keepe houſe within vs.
               
                  THE vſes, which we ought to make of the conſideration of the ſecond title, are eſpecially two.Vſe. 1.
               
               Firſt, conſidering that we are Gods houſe, we are taught ſo to dreſſe vp our ſelues, as that we may be pleaſing to him, and not offenſiue. To this end we muſt remoue thoſe things which are diſpleaſing, and deck our ſelues with ſuch things as he doth delight in. We muſt therfore tune the diſordered ſtrings of our ſinfull ſoules, & labour for a ſweet concent in all our affections, that they may be iointly fixed vpon good and not on euill, & that there may be as li
                     •
                  
                  tle diſcord & iarring in thē as is poſſible, whiles we continue in theſe houſes of clay. We muſt yet proceed a little further, labouring with all our power

to cleanſe our ſoules & bodies of all filthineſſe of ſin. We muſt kill the ſpiders of a poiſonfull and rancorous ſpirit. We muſt bruſh downe the cobwebs of proud and haughty imaginations, which are mounted vp into the turrets of the head, and cleaue (as it were) to the ſeeling of the braine. We muſt by true repentance ſweep out of our hearts the duſt of wickedneſſe, as couetouſneſſe, worldly cares, and ſuch like, and cleanſe out all vncleaneneſſe of fornication and fleſhly deſires. We muſt let out the ſmoake of iniquity, and purge our ſelues of al our ſins by true remorſe, by godly ſorrow, and vnfeigned mortification. Ier. 4.14 
                  O Ieruſalem waſh thine heart from wickedneſſe, that thou maiſt be ſaued! How long ſhall thy wicked thoughts remaine within thee? Waſh you, 
                  Iſa. 1.16 
                  make you cleane (ſaith the Lord:) take away the euill of your works from before mine eyes, We muſt not make our ſelues, who are Gods houſe, to be the dennes of ſins, which like Theeues rob him of that honour which is due vnto him. Therfore

as good 2 Chron 34.33. 
                  Ioſiah, tooke away all the abominations out of all his countries: ſo let vs by true repentance remoue al our ſins, which are al abominable, out of all the corners of our hearts. And as the 2 Chron 29.16.18. 
                  Prieſts and Leuits cleanſed all the Houſe of God, and brought out all the vncleaneneſſe, & threw it into Kidron: ſo let vs which are ſpirituall 
                  Reu. 1.6. 
                  Prieſts in Gods ſpirituall Temple, cleanſe the houſes of our hearts of all vncleaneneſſe of our ſins, and condemne and caſt them into the pit of hell, that ſulphirie lake, from whence they came; that ſo the workes of the diuell being diſſolued & himſelfe eiected, he may be paſt all hope of future entrance and recouery of his former hold; that howſoeuer he may looke in at the doore, or peep in at the window by his tentations, and dart in a wicked thought, yet he may find no roome ſwept vp and furniſhed for him to reſt in, and make his manſion. Neither is it ſufficient for vs to clenſe our ſelues of that which doth defile vs: but we muſt: alſo decke

and adorne our ſelues with thoſe things, which are neat and comly▪ We ſhould therfore ſtrew our hearts with the freſh flowers of Gods graces. We1 Pet. 5.5. ſhould decke our ſelues inwardly with the lowlineſſe of mind. We ſhould hang our ſoules with the rich arras and coſtly tapeſtry of holineſſe, innocency and ſinceritie. We ſhould perfume our hearts with coales of Iuniper and with the frankincenſe of Gods Spirit. We ſhould ſet open our windowes, that the bleſſed Sunne of righteouſneſſe may ſhine into vs, to warme and enlighten vs. We ſhould ſet open the gates of our hearts that the king of glory may come in. And finally we ſhould preſent our ſelues vnto him, as a liuing and holy ſacrifice. We ſhould prepare the banquet of an honeſt heart and a good conſcience for him. And we ſhould giue him the beſt entertainement, that we are able, in all reſpect. And ſo doing we ſhall be pleaſing to him, and ſhall reape exceeding comfort to our ſelues.

And therfore al thoſe are to be reproued, which profeſſe themſelues to be the houſes of the liuing God, and yet wallow in their ſins, as hogges in the mire, & are full of the duſt of wickedneſſe, giuing themſelues ouer to ignorāce, profanenes, worldlineſſe, drunkennes, epicuriſme, & all vncleanenes. Theſe are not the Temples of the Spirit but the tents of the diuell. Theſe are not the houſes of God, but the tabernacles of wickedneſſe, the ſinks of ſin, & the cabbins of vncleane ſpirits; hauing not onely the fire of ſin within them, but beeing indeed alſo compaſſed about with the flames thereof on euery ſide. And let them in time take heed and come forth. For ſin is a fire that burneth to deſtruction. It worketh both a confuſion in the ſoule, & the confuſion of the ſoule. The wages thereof is the eternall death both of ſoule and body. Rom. 6 23.
               
                  Vſe. 2.Secondly, ſeeing we are GODS houſe, we may aſſure our ſelues that he will reſide and dwell within vs. The Lord will be in his temple for

euer. Now what a ſingular comfort ſhould this be to vs alway, in that we haue the great God of heauen and earth reſiding in vs? What an honour is it to vs that the king of kings ſhould keepe his court continually in vs? Let vs be thankfull to him for this fauour. Be not like the thankleſſe ſwine, that ſwallowes downe the fruit, but lookes not to the treee from whence it fell. And ſo much for the firſt doctrine.
            
            
               CHAP. 6. Men may be Gods Houſe & Husbandry, though they be not ſo holy as is meet.
               
                  
                     Doct. 2
                  SEcondly, in that the Apoſtle cals the Corinthians (who were factious, fleſhly, litigious, and ſomthing too diſorderly) Gods field & building; I cōclude that mē profeſſing Chriſt, as they did, muſt not for ſome enormities be by & by reputed abiects, or men, that are not in grace with God, or as men, that are fallen from God, and cut off from Chriſt. Dauid, Salomon, Hezekiah

and Peter ſinned grieuouſly, but yet they were neuer wholly forſaken of God, nor voyde of true grace; though for a time it was caſt as it were into a ſwoone, and lay obſcure, as fire in aſhes, or as the act of reaſon in a man that is ſtarke drunke, or faſt aſleepe. Though thou fauour of the ſmoake of ſin, and be vp to the wayſt in iniquitie, yet if thou labor to come forth, and doſt purge thy ſelfe by penitency, thy caſe is not deſperate, it is not damnable. If thou beeſt weake and fleſhly, as theſe Corinthiant were; yet if thou wilt warre with thy fleſh, and contend againſt thy weakneſſe, if thou doeſt labour conſtantly to ſubdue thy luſts, and doeſt truly repent of thy ſinne ſo ſoone as thou doſt eſpie it, then deſpaire not, but aſſure thy ſelfe that thou art in Gods fauour, and that thou art one of his plants, & a liuing ſtone of his ſpirituall building: and enioying his fauor in this life, thou ſhalt alſo ſee his face to the ſolace of thy ſoule in the life to come. Amen.
               
            
         
         
            
            Morning prayer for the Family.
            
               O Eternal Lord God, who art great and fearefull, and ſheweſt mercy to them that loue thee, and keep thy commandements: we haue committed iniquity, and haue done wickedly before thine eyes, we haue rebelled againſt thy Maieſty, & haue tranſgreſſed againſt thy lawes, we haue bin vnmindful of thy mercies, & do continually ſin againſt thee, ſo that to vs appertaineth open ſhame, and confuſion of face for euer: yet compaſſion and forgiuenes is in thee, there is mercy with thee that thou maiſt be feared. Haue mercy therfore vpon vs, we humbly pray thee, and according to the multitude of thy compaſſions put away our tranſgreſſions.

Encline thine eare, O Lord, and heare. Looke vpon vs in thy Sonne Chriſt Ieſus, and in him be reconciled to vs. Giue vs the feeling of thy grace, and an aſſurance of thy princely pardon. Put thy Spirit into our hearts (wee beſeech thee) and cauſe vs to walke in thy waies. Breake our marble hearts aſunder, take away their ſtonineſſe, and mollify them with the oile of thy grace. Cauſe vs to hate & leaue our ſinnes, and to warre with all our luſts. Draw vs; and we will run after thee: conuert vs, & we ſhall be conuerted. Incline our hearts vnto thy teſtimonies, and keepe vs in thy feare. Teach vs, O Lord, to number our daies, that we may apply our hearts vnto wiſedom. Thou art our creatour, forſake not the worke of thine hands. Cauſe the light of thy countenance to ſhine vpon vs, and let thy tender mercies come vnto vs. Direct our ſteps in thy word: ſtay vs, and we ſhall be ſafe. Leaue vs not vnto our ſelues, but ſuſteine vs by thy grace. Proſper

the works of our hands, and giue ſucceſſe vnto our labours. Let our going out and coming in be bleſſed, and cauſe thine Angels to protect vs. Thou art our Father, prouide thou for vs, and preſerue vs. Thou haſt wedded vs vnto thy ſelfe as an Husband, ſuffer vs not to goe an whoring from thee. Thou haſt bene beneficial to vs, thou haſt giuen vs thy Goſpell, thou haſt ſent vs thy Prophets, thou haſt honored vs with peace and proſperity, and haſt giuen vs great deliuerances: our health, our friends, our liberty, all our being and well being, all that we haue, euen all is of thee: thou giueſt vs our reſt in the night, thou makeſt vs ſleepe in ſafety, and reneweſt thy mercies to vs in the morning: infinite is thy loue, innumerable are thy fauours toward vs: we beſeech thee therefore, O Lord, giue vs thankfull hearts vnto thy Maieſty. Open thou our lips, that our mouths may ſhew forth thy praiſe: & grant vs grace to dedicate our ſelues vnto thee. Bleſſe (we pray thee) thy

holy Church, and be good vnto thy people. Giue not the ſoule of thy Turtle done vnto the Beaſt. Be fauourable vnto Sion, and build the wals of Ieruſalem. Increaſe thy kingdome, & deſtroy thine enimes. Bleſſe thy ſeruant Iames our noble king: find out his enimies, ſet thy ſelfe againſt them, and make his crowne to flouriſh on his head. Be mercifull (we beſeech thee) to all other States amongſt vs: giue eare to the cry of thy Saints, & not to the cry of our ſins. Grant, O Lord, that we may all of vs ſerue thee in the vnity of faith with vnanimity of ſpirit, that ſo glorifying thy name in this world, we may be glorified of thee for euer in the world to come. Heare vs, O Lord, we beſeech thee, and grant vs theſe our requeſts for the merits of Ieſus Chriſt alone; vnto whom with thee and the holy Ghoſt be rendred all honour, praiſe, and power this day and for euer.
         
         
            
            Euening prayer for the Family.
            
               GRatious God and mercifull Father in Ieſus Chriſt, we do here bow downe the knees of our ſoules and bodies in thy preſence, offering vp this our Euening ſacrifice of praiſe & praier vnto thee, giuing thee vnfeigned thanks, for all thy fauours towards vs, for electing vs vnto eternall life, for creating vs according to thine image, for redeeming vs by the bloud of thy Son, for ſanctifying vs by thine holy Spirit, for our health, peace, and liberty, for clothing and feeding vs, for protecting and proſpering of vs this preſent day,Nouem. 5 Anno. 1605. and for that great and admirable deliuerance vouchſafed to this whole State and kingdom from that barbarous

and bloudy confuſion, plotted & almoſt performed by the wicked, the children of Babel: thy name (O Lord) be praiſed for theſe and all other thy mercies. Forgiue vs, we beſeech thee, our great vnthankfulneſſe and all the reſt of our ſins, our ignorances, wilfulneſſes, negligences, preſumptions, & all other our tranſgreſſions, & rebellions: O Lord, forgiue them all vnto vs for Ieſus Chriſt his ſake. Waſh them al away in his bloud, naile them faſt vnto his croſſe, & bury thē in his graue. Cloth vs (we pray thee) with his robes, and honour vs with thy Spirit. Worke in vs godly ſorrow and remorſefull ſpirits. Mortify our ſinfull luſts, and adorne vs with all thy graces. Open our eyes, that we may ſee thy will, and incline our hearts to follow it. Direct vs in thy waies, and keepe vs from declining from thee. Teach vs ſo to frame our liues before thee in this word, that we may liue for euer with thee in the world to come. Be merciful (O Lord, we beſeech thee) to thy Church, and

to all her faithfull members: comfort them with thy comforts, and inrich them with thy graces. Bleſſe this kingdome, wherein we liue, pardon the ſins of all eſtates amongſt vs, and continue thy Goſpell to vs, and to our poſterity, to the end of the world. Looke vpon thine annointed Iames our ſouereigne Lord & king: adorne his heart with all regall and Chriſtian vertues, vphold his ſcepter, prolong his reigne, & laugh his foes to skorne. Bleſſe our gracious queene Anne, Prince Henry, and the reſt of their princely progeny. Be mercifull to all other orders amongſt vs, aſwell Eccleſiaſticall as Ciuill: and as thou aboundeſt in thy mercies towards vs, ſo grant that we may ſtriue to abound in all thankfulneſſe towards thee. Finally, O Lord, for our ſelues; we beſeech thee to take vs to thy fatherly protection: pardon the weakeneſſe of our praiers, watch thou ouer vs to our good, & giue vs ſuch reſt & ſleep that we may be the fitter enabled to ſerue thee the next day in our general and

ſpeciall callings. Heare (holy Father) from the heauens, and grant vs all theſe our requeſts for Ieſus Chriſt his ſake, thine onely Sonne, and our onely Sauiour: to whom with thee and thine holy Spirit, one moſt wiſe, glorious and eternall God, be rendred all power, praiſe, & glory this night & for euer. Amen.
            
            Trin-vni Deo gloria.
