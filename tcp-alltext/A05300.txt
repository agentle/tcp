The like wrought your highnesses most noble father of excellent memory Kynge Henry the. viij. though it were in an other kinde, suche time as he dyscharged this his realme of Antichristes noyful cattel, Monkes, Chanons, Frires, Nonnes, Heremites, Perdoners, and soule syngers, with other execrable sectes of perdicion. Neuerthelesse oure Egypcyanes both of the clergye, and layte, haue soughte euer sens, and yet seketh to this daye, to leade youre Maiesties people in a palpable kynde of darkenesse vp their masses, and other sorcerouse witchcraftes, as lately apered in the last commocyon of Cornewale and Deuenshyre, to reduce them

But your noble counsell, to withstande thys vyolence, hath hytherto moste worthelye wrought, in the myghtie worde of the Lorde, & in the stronge power of your regall rodde, to dryue thys horryble plage of darkenesse from the face of thys earthe, and our good hope is, that they wyl gracyously so styll continue.
            Salomon is commended of Iesus ye sonne of Syrach, Eccle. xlvij. for that the Lorde had hym replenyshed wyth all wysdome, & for hys sake had dryuē the enemyes awaye farre of, that he myghte buylde an howse in hys name, and prepare vnto hym a sanctuary for euer, whych al to this daye we behold in youre kyngelye persone fulfylled, prayeng vnto God that it maye so styl endure. As in your pryncelye begynnynges ye apere vnto as a very Iosias both in youre tendre youthe & vertuouse educacyon, so our specyal hope is, that in your dayly procedinges we wyl styl perseuer the same. The lykelyhodes in

               IN what estymacion Antyquytees haue bene had amonge men of graue wyttes and iudgementes,Antiquitees. the hystoryes whyche are, as testyfyeth Cicero, the mastresses of lyfe & exposytours of tymes, haue not omytted to declare. The most auncyent and authorysable Antiquytees are those, whych Moses left to the Hebrues, and Berosus to the Caldeanes, as moste precyouse treasure, and lyuelye memoryalles in wrytinge, that both the Iewes and the Gentyles,peoples and in them all nacyons of the worlde myghte therby knowe theyr orygynall begynnynges. What hath bene done besydes in the partycular Kyngedomes abroade by theyr antique wryters, it is knowne to them whyche haue of longe time bene

exercysed in the readyng of theyr most auncyēt chronycles. Though Gyldas Badonicus do reporte on the one syde, in his fyrst treatise de excidio Britanniae, that all the olde monumentes of the Brytaynes hadde peryshed afore hys tyme, and were partlye brente by the enemyes, and partlye conueyed into other landes by them that fledde from hens. And although that Bedas Girminus also on ye other syde,Bedas. in settynge fourth the hystorye of the Englyshe Saxons, doth omyt the Antiquytees of the seyd Brytaynes their predecessours, partly of hate, as it is supposed, and partly for want of theyr olde wrytynges. Yet remayned there of late yeares in serten lybraryes of thys realme (I haue seane parte of them) the moste worthye monumentes,Lybraryes. concernynge Antiquite, of Ninianus, Patricius, Ambrosius Merlinus, Gildas Albanius, Merlinus Syluester, Thelesinus, Melkinus, Kentigernus, Nennius, Samuel, & other lyke,wryters of whome the more parte wrote longe afore them.
            
               But thys is hyghly to be lamented, of all them that hath a naturall loue to their contrey,Loue. eyther yet to lerned Antiquyte, whyche is a moste syngular bewty to the same. That in turnynge ouer of ye superstycyouse monasteryes, so lytle respecte was had to theyr lybraryes for the sauegarde of those noble & precyouse monumētes. I do not denye it, but the monkes,Mōkes. chanons, & fryres, were wycked both wayes, as the oyled Byshoppes and prestes for the more part are yet styll. Fyrst for so much as they were the professed souldyours of Antichrist, & next to that, for so muche as they were moste execrable lyuers. For these causes, I must confesse them most iustly suppressed. Yet this would I haue wyshed (and I scarsely vtter it wythout teares) that the profytable corne had not so vnaduysedly and vngodly peryshed wyth the vnprofytable chaffe,abbeyes nor the wholsome herbes with the vnwholsome wedes, I meane the worthy workes of men godly mynded, and lyuelye memoryalles of our nacyon, wyth those laysy lubbers and

popyshe bellygoddes.lubbers But dyuerse were the workers of thys desolacyon, lyke as the thynges dyssypated were dyuerse. The veryte and promyse of our eternall God, made an ende of the popes dysguysed rable, as it wyll do of hys remnaunt, whyche are wele knowne by their frutes. All plantes (sayth Christe) whyche my heauenlye father hath not planted,Masmō
                  gers. shall be plucked vp by the rootes, least anye longar the blynde leaders shoulde leade the blynde multytude. Math. xi.
            Auaryce was the other dyspatcher, whych hath made an ende both of our lybraryes and bokes wythout respecte lyke as of other moste honest commodytees,couetyse to no small decaye of the commen welthe. Cyrus the Kynge of Perseanes (as testifyeth Esdras) had a noble lybrary in Babylon,Cyrus. for the conseruacyon both of the landes Antiquytees & also of the prynces actes, lawes, & commaundementes, that whan necessyte shoulde requyre it, the certentie of thynges myghte there be sought and founde out. i. Esdre. vi. Nehemias theNehemias.
               
Prophete made a lybrarye also, and gathered into it bokes from all contreyes, specyally the bokes of the prophetes and of Dauid, the epystles and actes of the kynges, with sertē annotacyons and writynges, Iudas Machabeus addynge dyuerse vyctoryes to the same. ij. Ma
                  •
               ha. ij. Thus are buylders of lybraryes commended in the scriptures, than must their destroyers haue of the same,Destroyers. their iustly deserued infamyes, namelye whan couetousnesse is founde the most busy doar, whose workes are alwayes to be detested. Wherfore Salomon sayth: A dyscrete & iuste rular muche profyteth a lande, where a couetouse rauenour destroyeth it agayne, Prouer. xxix. O most wycked auaryce,Auaryce Saynte Paule calleth the a worshyppynge of ydolles, whyche is a takynge awaye of all godly honour, Collos. iij. He sayth, thou art suche a temptacyon and snare of the deuyll, as bryngeth all to perdycyon. Yea, he reporteth the to be the roote of all my schefe. i. Timot. vi. Nothynge vpon earth (sayth Iesus Syrach) is so euyll,

as a couetouse man. Eccle. x.
            Neuer had we bene offended for the losse of our lybraryes,Lybraryes. beynge so many in nombre, and in so desolate places for the more parte, yf the chiefe monumentes and moste notable workes of our excellent wryters, had bene reserued. If there had bene in euery shyre of Englande, but one solēpne lybrary, to the preseruacyon of those noble workes, and preferrement of good lernynges in oure posteryte, it had bene yet sumwhat. But to destroye all without consyderacyon,Destruccyon. is and wyll be vnto Englande for euer, a moste horryble infamy amonge the graue senyours of other nacyons. A great nombre of thē whych purchased those superstycyouse mansyons, reserued of those lybrarye bokes, some to serue theyr inkes, some to scoure theyr candelstyckes, & some to rubbe their bootes. Some they solde to the grossers and sope sellers,grossers & some they sent ouer see to ye bokebynders, not in small nombre, but at tymes whole shyppes full, to the wonderynge of the foren nacyons. Yea, the vnyuersytees

of thys realme, are not all clere in this detestable fact. But cursed is that bellye, whyche seketh to be fedde with suche vngodly gaynes, and so depelye shameth hys natural cōtreye. I knowe a merchaunt man,A Merchaunt. whych shall at thys tyme be namelesse, that boughte the cō
               tentes of two noble lybraryes for. xl. shyllynges pryce, a shame it is to be spoken. Thys stuffe hath he occupyed in the stede of graye paper by the space of more than these. x. yeares, & yet he hath store ynough for as many yeares to come. A prodygyuose example is this,An exā
                  ple. & to be abhorred of all men which loue their nacyon as they shoulde do.
            O cyties of Englande, whose glory standeth more in bellye chere, than in the serche of wysdome godlye. How cometh it, that neyther you, nor yet your ydell masmōgers,norwich haue regarded thys most worthy commodyte of your contrey?

Vnknowne is it not vnto you, but that the most noble conquerours of the worlde, haue euermore had in muche pryce the Antiquytees of storyes, and haue lerned of them the thynge which hath most incresed their worthy fame.
            Now come we to the author of thys present treatyse, whyche plenteouslye hath declared the abundaunce of a noble harte to hys contreye. Thys was Iohan Leylande,Leylāde an excellent oratour and poete, moreouer a man lerned in many sondrye languages, as Greke, Latyne, Frenche, Italion, Spanyshe, Brittyshe, Saxonyshe, Walshe, Englyshe, and Scottyshe. A most feruent fauourer was thys man, and a moste

dylygent sercher of the Antiquytees of thys oure Englyshe or Bryttyshe nacyon,Antiquarius. as wyll apere not onelye by thys treatyse folowynge, but also by many other notable workes whyche he hath lernedly compyled. Bycause I wyll not stande alone in the prayse of hym and hys worthye actes, I wyll now brynge fourth an other wytnesse,A witnesse. a man lerned and louynge hys contrey also, whych wrote vnto me. iij. yeares ago, dolourouslye lamentynge hys soden fall. Maistre Leyande (sayth he) whose prynted workes I haue sent yow, is in suche a frenesy at thys present, that lytle hope I haue of hys recouer, wherby he myghte fynyshe such thynges as he began, and would haue ended, yf lyfe, helthe, and ryghte reason had serued hym therunto. There be dyuerse whyche (by report of hys enemyes,Oblocutours. as Polydore Vergyle and others) saye, that he wolde neuer haue set fourth suche thynges as he promysed, affirmynge hym to be a vaynegloryouse persone, whyche woulde promyse more, than euer he was able

or intended to perfourme.
            I muche do feare it that he was vaynegloryouse, and that he had a poetycall wytt, whyche I lament,Lamentable. for I iudge it one of the chefest thynges that caused hym to fall besydes hys ryghte dyscernynges. But thys dare I be holde to saye, as one that knoweth it (for I sawe and redde of them in his stody, dyuerse and many tymes) that he neuer promysed to set fourth so manye workes as he had dygested in an ordre,workes and had in a forwarde redynesse to haue set fourth. And surelye in suche a sort he handeled the matters by hym treated of, that (by my symple iudgement) if he had so fynyshed them and set them fourth accordynge as he than intended and wolde haue done. Truly I suppose no lesse, but it wolde haue byn a wondre (yea,A wondre. a myracle to the worlde) to haue redde them. And that all other authors, whyche haue wrytten of vs and of oures in tymes paste, concernynge thynges memorable, to be chronycled, eyther yet put in writynge, shoulde haue bene counted

but as shaddowes, or of small estymacyon in respect of hym. So lernedlye, lyuelye, euydently, and groundedlye, and with such authorytees (Yea,Autorytees. and as it were wyth a serten maiestie) woulde he haue fullye and whollye paynted, described, or set fourth thys oure realme and all thynges therin, wyth all the domynyons therof, and wyth all suche thynges as haue from tyme to tyme byn done in them.
            I was as famylyarlye acquaynted wyth hym,Acquainted. as wyth whome I am best acquaynted, and do knowe certenlye, that he from his youth was so ernestly studyouse and desperouse of our Antiquytees, that alwayes hys whole studyes were dyrected to that ende. And for the true and full attaynynge therunto, he not onlye applyed hym selfe to the knowledge of the Greke and Latyne tongues, wherin he was (I myghte saye) excellentlye lerned.

all content, he dyd fully and whollye both labour and trauayle in hys owne persone, throughe this our realme and certen of the dominiōs therof, because he woulde haue the perfyte and full knoweledge of al thynges that myghte be gathered or learned, bothe for thynges memorable, and for the sytuacyon of the same. And as for all authors of Greke,Authors Latyne, Frenche, Italian, Spanyshe, Bryttyshe, Saxonyshe, Walshe Englyshe, or Scottyshe, towching in any wyse the vnderstandynge of oure Antiquitees, he had so fully redde and applyed them, that they were in a manner grassed in hym as of nature. So that he myght well cal him selfe Antiquarius.
            
            Surely my frynde, I can not therfore but lament this hys estate, boldelye affirminge,Doloously. that Englande neuer sawe (nor as I beleue, shal se, excepte God saye Amen therto) a man to him herin in al thynges to be compared. For vndoubted he was in these matters wonderfull and peerlesse, so that as concerninge them, Englande had yet neuer

a greater losse. But what shall we saye? It hath pleased god that he shuld thus be depryued of hys wyttes, that lord knoweth best what he hath to do, hys name for euermore blessed.

                But thys shalbe my prayer styll, that yf the Lorde wyll not geue hym his ryghte vnderstandinge agayne, that it maye yet pleased his goodnesse, to put in the mindes of some that best may, to do it. That not only such thinges as maistre Leylande intended to haue set fourth of hys owne,Old writers. but also suche olde authors as he hath gathered together into hys lybraryes (and as yet not prynted) may (and that with spede) be set fourth in prynte, for the necessary knowledge of all men touchynge Antiquitees. But after suche rate and forte as Maystre Leylande hym selfe (yf hys ryght reason had serued hym, woulde haue set them fourth, for that do I neuer loke. But hereof ones to make an ende as Terence feately sayth,Terencius. 
               ut quimus, quando ut uolumus non licet. We must do as we may, when we can not do as we woulde, All these are the testymonies

of my frynde.
            Thus am I not alone in opynyon concernyng Iohan Leylande and such other for Antiquitees sake, but haue so manye more with their good willes to assiste me as naturallye fauoreth Englande.Not alone. By thys worthye propertye (sayth Cassiodorus) is a noble citezen knowen. He seketh the cōmodite, praise and aduauncement of hys countreye. Swete is the remembraunce of a mannes naturall lande, to hym that is absent. The byrdes that flye abroade, do loue their owne nestes. The beastes that ronne astraye,Creatures. seketh their accustomed cowches. And the fyshes within the water, resorteth to their hollow dē
               nes. Ryght notably was it alleged of Plato, that we are not borne onlye to our owne commoditees. But we ought to haue respect both to our countrey & kyndred. Of our natural countrey we haue our parētes, our fode, our norishmēt, frendship, frindes, acquayntaūce howse, wyfe, chyldren, with such lyke. The fathers in the olde lawe,Fathers had such an inwarde loue to their natyue soyle,

that they woulde no where els be buried. Though Christ our moste louynge maystre sayde it. That a Prophete is not withoute honour but in his owne countrey and kindred. Matth. xiij. Yet bewtifyed it he aboue al nacyons, both with his doctrine and miracles, alledgynge many of their noble Antiquitees in Noe, Loth, Abraham, Isaac, Iacob, Dauid, Salomon, Elias, Eliseus, and other to confirme thē in the true faith. He that naturallye loueth hys lande, obeyeth therwyth the commaundementes of God concernyng the loue of his neyber, and the faythful obedyence of kynges. Whych I instaūtly desyre al godly subiectes to folow, to the prayse of him which gaue those necessarye commaundementes.
            So be it.

               An other cause Iohan Leylande bryngeth fourth here, of thys serche of lybraries, which is, that the scriptures of God myght therby be more purely taught then afore in the Romish popes time. Moreouer,ye truthe. that al kyndes of wicked superstycyons, and of the sophystycall doctrynes myghte be remoued

the monkes and fryres libraryes. The greate want of them hath caused our latter Chronicles, specyally Iohan Hardynge, Wyllyam Caxton, Robert Fabiane, and now last of al Polydor Vergyll, so depely to erre, as they haue done in many poyntes. And. ij. thynges chefely haue caused them (Leylande sayth) so longe to be witholden frō vs.ij. things The one is the slackenesse of empryntynge, that no studiouse persone, myndynge the veritees preferrement, hath laboured their settynge out, to the cō

to profyte. But where as he maketh report here,Of bokes. a serten of them to haue bene emprynted in Germany.

               In thys ded Iohan Leylande declare a noble kynde of stody and a naturall hart to hys contrey. The Lorde of heauē sende England more of suche louers,More fryndes and take awaye those vnprofytable cloddes, whyche seketh not els but them selues in the destruccyon of thynges memorable & necessarye. The boke of S. Hierome de uiris illustribus, is iudged of them that be godly, wyse, and lerned, to be a worke verye excellent, and muche profytable to the Christen commen vse. For it sheweth what writers there were in the prymatyue churche,Church & what frute spronge of their doctryne. If anye learned man hadde shewed thys ordre in the Brittyshe churche, whyche contynued from the Apostles tyme by Ioseph of Arymathie,

and other godlye mynysters, tyll the commynge of Augustyne, we had knowne of their christianyte muche more than we now do. Bedas in the Englysh churche, wrote De scriptoribus Ecclesiae, whych had clerelye peryshed Gesnerus sayth) yf one Honorius Augustudimensis had not into his boke of the same tytle,Honoriꝰ conuayed a certen of them. Other collectors of the names & workes of lerned writers, had we none here in Englande, that I euer hearde of, sauynge one Bostonus of Bury, whyche was verye copyouse in that matter. Now cōmeth Iohan Leylande with hys. iiij. bokes de uiris illustribus, & he so abundauntlye wyll satisfye the hungry expectacyon of many, maye hys worke come ones to lyght,Leylād. that muche more is not therin to be desyred.

do thynke of them that so frantycklye on their ale benches do prattle, it is easy to coniecture. Saynt Hierome, Gennadius, Cassiodorus, Seuerianus & Tritemius, whome Leylande here nameth for example, thought not the argument lyghte, whan they wrote workes of that tytle. No more ded Suidas Grecus, Isidorus, Hildefonsus, Prosper, Sigebertus, Honorius, Trissa, Bostonus, Bostius, Bergomas, & a great sort more,Authores. in doynge the same. The ordre of Leylandes worke into. iiij bokes deuyded, begynnynge at the Druides, & endyng in the lattre yeares of Kynge Henry the. viij. as he hath herin vttered, is very commendable.

As concernynge the Hebrue,Hebrues it is to be thought, that many were therin wele learned in the dayes of Kynge Athelstane. For at the instaunt request of his prelates, he caused the scriptures out of that tungue to be by certē doctours translated into the Saxonysh or Englyshe speche, as in the chronycles is mencyoned. Robert Grosthede of Sothfolke, a famouse learned man, & sumtyme byshop of Lyncolne, extracted many thynges out of the Hebrues commentaryes, specyally, he translated the Testament of the Patryarkes, and out of the Greke certen workes of Aristotle,Grekes.

               MArke sens ye worldes begynnynge, how studyouse & dylygēt men haue alwayes bene, for the conseruacyon of noble Antiquytees,Antiquytees. Yea, afore any kyndes of letters were yet in vse. For the chyldren of Seth (as testyfieth Iosephus) admonyshed by Adam of the destruccyon that shulde folowe by water & fyer, engraued in. ij. pyllours the necessary memoryals of their age. And consydre agayne the wyckednesse of our tyme, how vngracyouse and vntowarde we are in the myddes of floryshynge lyterature, to exercyse ourselues in that moste worthye offyce. Their labour was to holde thynges in remembraunce,Auncetours. whych otherwyse had most wretchedly peryshed. Our practyses

now are, to do so muche as in vs lyeth, to destroye their frutefull foūdacyons. They were not so ready in settynge vp for their tymes, but we in these dayes are as prompte to plucke downe (I meane the monumentes of lernynge) as though the worlde were now in hys lattre dottynge age, nygh drawynge to an ende. The Hebrues, Grekes, and Romanes,Examples. were neuer so towarde in thys noble veyne of workynge, but we haue bene by all ages as vntowarde. Notwithstandynge some worthy doars we haue had, whose noble workes we muche lesse esteme in these dayes, than ded the popysh monkes and prestes for their ydle tymes. For they at the least permytted them a dwellynge place in their lybraryes, though it were amonge wormes and dust. We will not suffre them to abyde wythin our lande,Ignomeny. but eyther we geue them leaue to rotte in vyle corners, or drowne them in our iakes, or els we sende them ouer the see, neuer to returne agayne. Alas I am heauy to tell this tale, yet the naturall loue of my cōtrey

most strongely compelleth me to saye sumwhat therin.
            We sende to other nacyons to haue their commodytees, and all is to lyttle to feade our fylthye fleshe. But the syngular commodytees within our owne realme,Commodytees. we abhorre and throwe fourth as most vyle noysome matter. Auydyously we drynke the wynes of other lādes, we bye vp their frutes & spyces, yea, we consume in aparell their sylkes & their veluettes. But alas our owne noble monumentes and precyouse Antiquytees, whych are the great bewtie of our lande, we as lyttle regarde as ye parynges of our nayles, Antiochus, Herode, & Dyoclecyane, are wonderfully yet spotted in the most authorysed chronycles, & haue vpon their heades a double note of tyranny,Tyrauntes. for cruellye destroyenge the monumentes of nacyons, specyally of christen relygyon. The moste spyghtfull acte of the seyd Dioclecyane, Gyldas Badonicus muche lamenteth in hys worke of the destruccyon of Brytayne, declarynge how he in the open stretes there, brent

all the scriptures & godlye writynges that myghte anye where be founde. Eutropius sheweth in the sixt boke of hys Romane hystory,Eutropius. that Achillas a duke sekynge to do myschefe agaynste hys emprour, fyered a lybrary of fortie thousande bokes, a syngular monument of study & of dylygence amonge the Grekes, whyche wyth excedynge labour and layser had gathered so wurthye workes of so noble wyttes in so great nombre togyther. Iacke Strawe and watte Tyler. ij. rebellyouse captaynes of the commens in the tyme of Kynge Richarde the seconde,Iack Straw. brent all the lawers bokes, regesters, and writynges within the cytie of London, as testifyeth Iohan Maior and Fabyane in their chronycles.
            The Anabaptystes in our tyme,Anabaptistes. an vnquyetouse kynde of men, arrogaunt without measure, capcyose and vnlerned, do leaue non olde workes vnbrēt, that they maye easely come by, as apered by the lybraryes at Mynster in the lande of Westphaly, whom they most furyously destroyed. An able wytnesse

of thys their wycked custome, is Petrus Plateanus amonge many others in hys treatyse agaynst their dogged doynges. Libros omnes exurunt (inquit) indignantes se ab alio, quam ab ipso suo spiritu doctos uideri Miserum est cernere Bibliothecas non ignobiles ab execranda secta hoc modo aboleri.
               Lybraryes. The Anabaptistes burne all bokes (sayth he) without respect, thynkynge scorne of any other sprete to seme learned, than of theyr owne fanatycall braynes. A wretched thynge it is to beholde, the noble lybraryes so to be destroyed of that execrable secte. Antonius Coruinus sayth also in hys boke agaynst them.Coruinꝰ

The fury or frantycke madnesse of the Anabaptistes, hath consumed awaye the most excellent writers and the moste noble exemplaryes of honorable Antiquyte, in the worthie lybrary of Osnaburg. I coulde brynge out a great nombre of lyke testimonyes,Lerned men. from Oecolampadius, Zuinglius

Bullinger, Caluyne, and Philyppe Melanchton, wyth other of the most notable wryters of our age, concernynge thys vngracyouse vyolence of these chymney prechers and benche bablers, but lete these two rehearced at thys tyme suffyse.
            I wyshe all naturall noble hartes, and fryndely men to theyr contrey, as wele worldelye occupyers as men of bloude ryall, to consydre those myscheuouse examples of these cruell tyrauntes & wycked Anabaptistes,Examples. that they myghte so abhorre them, and wyth all endeuour possyble auoyde the lyke. And that they maye gather an erneste occasyon so to do, I brynge them in here moste worthye examples of theyr forefathers in thys lande, to contrary and blemysh theyr frantycke and furyouse factes. Nennius Helius that noble Brytayne,Nēnius primus. brother to Cassibellanus and Luddus, is reported the fyrst that euer collected the famouse actes of the Britaynes. And therto (some men saye) he was fyrst moued, by that he hadde hearde of Reutha the Kynge

of Scottes, whyche sumwhat afore hys tyme hadde done the lyke concernynge that regyon. An other sorte applyeth it vnto the contencyon, whiche was betwyn Kynge Luddus hys brother and hym,Opynions. suche tyme as he transposed the cytie of Troynouaunt now called London. For in the transposynge therof, he chaunged the name, and from thens fourth called it Luddes towne, whyche as a frynde to Antiquyte, he greuouslye toke, for so muche as the noble name of Troye, shoulde by that meanes come to vtter oblyuyon wythin the lande. Those colleccyons Nennius the Prouost of Bannochor,Nēnius alter not farre from Westchestre, a man christenlye lerned for hys tyme, more than. vi. hondred yeares after translated into Latyne out of the Brittyshe language, as it is reported of the olde Brityshe wryters.
            Huldricus Mutius rehearceth in the. viij. boke of hys chronycle of the Germanes, that Charles the great so muche regarded Antiquytees,Charles that he

intermytted no daye, but at one tyme or other he alwayes therin redde eyther some auncyent hystorye or els the sacred scriptures. Alcuinus the Deacon, an Englyshe man, whyche was in those dayes hys chefe instructour, in a serten epystle that he writeth to the vniuersall churche of Englande, he muche commendeth a Biblyotheke or lybrary in Yorke, buylded by the archebyshoppe Egbert,Alcuinꝰ for the noble monumentes that were conserued therin.
            
               Date mihi (inquit) eruditionis libellos, quales in patriae mea Anglia, per industiam magisti mei Egberti habui, & remittam uobis aliquos ex pueris nostris, ut excipiant inde necessaria, & reuehant in Franciā flores Britanniae.

Se how studyouse and laboryouse men were in those dayes, not onlye for the conseruacyon of their lerned mennyes labours, but also that other nacyons shoulde haue profyte of them. Muche altered are we from that golden worlde, nowadayes.
            Lyke storyes do we reade, of Kyng Sigebert and Kynge Alphrede here in Englande,Kynges whyche not only sought out the best lerned men of theyr tymes to instruct their owne persones and famylyes, but also they appoynted certen houres euerye daye, for theyr owne pryuate studyes. In the ende, for increase of all kyndes of lernynge, they reared vp the. ij. vnyuersytees or generall studyes of Cambridge and Oxforde, bryngynge thydre all monumentes of doctryne, as a most necessarye

mayntenaunce and ornature to the same, whyche are in our dayes full myserablye decayed to oure realmes no small dyshonour.decayed But the cause therof maye easely be coniectured. In these lattre dayes, wherin Christ hath geuen to hys tyered congregacyon, the sylence of halfe an houre, or peace for a tyme without persecucyon of tyrauntes furyouse, Apoca. viij. God hath geuen to vs here in Englande wythall, that he sumtyme gaue to hys chosen people the Hebrues in the foren prouynces. He hath changed the harte of the lyon into the hate of our mortall enemye,Edward vtterlye to destroye hym and all suche as consent to hys myschefes, Hester in the. xiiij. cap. The harte of our noble Kynge is clerelye auerted from the cruell Haman of Rome, and from hys dysgysed tormentours that so gredyly sought the innocent bloude of hys people. Wherupon that rable of papystes careth not now what becometh of thys realme. They muche reioyce whan the honour therof turneth to destruccyon, as in thys decaye

of lybraryes.papistes So longe as Antichrist reygned, they were both writers and speakers, but sens Christ came abroade eyther grace and lernynge hath fayled thē, or els they mynde to bestowe non vpon hym. Yet some in corners hath bene folebolde, as hath wele apered by that wytlesse monstre whyche made the laste wylle of heresye, and forte of moste open Idolatrye, wyth suche other dottynge dastardes.
            Now to turne agayne to the worthye examples, of them that hadde respect to the honour of theyr contrey. That noble and valyaunt captayne syr Iohan Oldecastell, called also the Lorde Cobham,Iohan Cobhā. perceyuynge the outrage of the Romyshe popes clergye in hys tyme agaynste the good doctryne of Iohan Wicleue, caused all hys workes to be coppyed oute by moste fayre wryters, at his owne great cost and charge, and so connayed them into the lande of Berne, that they myghte be there preserued from destruccyon. Some parauenture wyll not allowe thys facte,wicleue for so muche

as their pope hath condempned Iohan Wicleue for an heretyke. But lete suche lewde papystes dwell styll in theyr accustomed frenesie, we knowe by hys doctryne that he was a true Apostle of Christ. Humfrey the good Duke of Glocestre,Hūfrey. for the fauer he bare to good letters, purchased a wonderfull nombre of bokes in all scyences, wherof he frely gaue to a lybrary in Oxforde, a hondred and. xxix. fayre volumes. Thomas Gascoigne reporteth in hys boke of the floudes of Babylon, that the kynges here in Englande, were wonte to holde a great nombre of good writers within the monasteryes of their foundacyons, to non other ende, but only to coppie out the memorable workes of olde writers specyally of the hystoryanes and chronyclers, that they myghte in their lybraryes perpetually remayne, appoyntynge them great stypendes. And thys worthie example they had from tyme to tyme of their fathers and predecessours.writers. But alas (sayth he) they now peryshe and come in great nombre to

nought for want of renuynge. What myghte thys good man haue sayde in our tyme, yf he had seane this pyteouse desolacyon that we now beholde?
            A fewe of vs there be, that woulde gladly saue the moste necessary monumentes of their dyspersed remnaunt. But wretched pouerte wyll not permyt vs,Pouerte to shewe to our contrey suche a naturall and necessary benefyte. Neyther wyll they permyt vs theyr olde coppyes, whyche haue them in possessyon, but rather they suffre them to rotte vndre their handes. Whan Bedas of Iaru wrote the chronycles of the Englyshe Saxons, he had all the helpe that myghte be of the byshoppes & lerned men here.Helpers Cymbertus wrote vnto hym all that was done in the prouynce of Lyndesay, now called lyncolne shiere. Nothelmus sent to hym also all that he hadde gathered togyther in Sussex, Sothray, & Kēte. Alcuinꝰ gaue hym hys labours & colleccyons for the prouynce of Yorke. Daniel of wynchestre made hym peny of all that was done amonge the West saxons. And frō
               
all other quarters of the land, were letters, scroules, and wrytinges, dyrected by massengers vnto him, to ayde that godly enterprise of his. As it was ones noysed abroade in our tyme, that Conradus Gesnerus a great learned man of Tygur in Germany,Gesnerꝰ was minded to put fourth his vniuersall Bibliotheke of all kindes of wryters, a nombre of learned men in Germany, Fraunce, & Italy, serched out the names of many straunge authors, with ye tytles of their workes, and sente their good labours vnto him to amplifie the same. So ded the printers also the cataloges and regestres of their printed workes, to the furtheraunce of good learninge and honest report of their names,Helpers as vndoubted they all for so doynge are worthye. I would to our lord that we had within this lande a nombre of learned men of the same honest zele to letters. So shulde our noble Antiquitees and monumentes of learninge be knowne to our posteryte, and our people be replenished with all kyndes of good knowledge.
            
               In all ages of the churche (saythe Baptista Mantuanus in Apologetico) had we men of eloquence and lernynge,Mantuanus. so wele whan it was in the Apostles time planted, as whan it was in the dayes of the Martyrs watered, and vndre the auncyent fathers and doctours noryshed and refreshed. Whyche sentence myghte as wele be founde true in thys oure Bryttyshe nacyon, as eyther in Asia, Palestyne, or Rome, in Ioseph of Arimathy and hys companyōs which fyrst taught vs the Christen fayth here, in Lucius the kynge,teachers Amphibalus, Aaron and Iulius. And last of all in Ninianus, Patricius, Elcutus, Dubrice Dauid, Congellus, Kentingerne, Asaph Gildas, and a greate sorte more, yf we had not in place of our true Antiquitees, moste deuylyshe fables and lyes. Whan the boke of Gods lawe, whiche Moses wrote, was founde in the chest of the Leuytes, good kynge Iosias wt the congregacyon of the Lorde,Iosias very muche lamented the blindnesse and ignoraunce of theyr fathers, for the wāt therof, and their owne mysfortune (as

they than thought it) that they had ben so longe wythout it. ij. Parali. xxxiiij. A notable maner had the Prophane or Ethnyck Prynces and Magistrates, in reseruyng the excellent frutes of profounde and rare wyttes for theyr posteryte, as are the noble workes of Socrates, Plato, Cicero, Virgyl, Arystotle, and Pliny. The nature of the ignoble and curryshe generacyon of Antichrist,Antichrist. hath alwayes ben busied, seking contrary wyse to obscure all thynges, that contayned any veryte necessarye.

All the Pantheōs, Palaces, Amphitheaters, Castels, Capitols, and other monstruouse buyldinges of the worlde,buildinges. are not to vs so notable, as is yet the name of one Theophilus a citiezen of Antioche, to whom S.

I pray God we may ones rightly way our owne slouthful neglygēce in thynges which myghte be greatlye to our honour. Then shoulde we sone perceyue, what a poynt it were of ignobylyte, to suffre such workes to perysh as we dayly with our eyes beholde. I

                  AN occasyō (me thinketh) is offered me here, to exhybit som part of my studious labours to the vse of my brethrē, I wold I were as able to geue them the whole contentes therof, as I coulde fynde in my harte to do it out of hande frely. Sens I returned home agayne from Germany, where as I both collected, and emprented my symple worke, de Scriptoribus Britannicis I haue for the full correccyon and further augmentacyon of the same, perused many libraries both in Cambridge and Oxforde. In the famouse cytye of London, is but one knowne library, so

farre as I can learne, whyche also by fauer I haue seane ouer. But alas for pytie, that it shoulde be reported of so noble a cytie, to haue but one lybrary, and that to be so slendre a thing as it is The tyme hath bene, whan it hath had a great nombre of the noblest libraries in all Christendome, their destenecyon at this daye, of men godly mynded, is muche to be lamēted. Though the acte were most cōmendable, to suppresse ye dysgysed sectes of the Romyshe Antichrist, and so to bannyshe them hens, yet can not the sufferaunce of this so heauy a ruine of Englandes noble monumentes, be so iudged of men wyse & learned, but alas, farre otherwyse.

Among the stacyoners & boke bynders, I found many notable Antiquitees, of whom I wrote out the tytles, tymes, and begynnynges, that we myghte at the leaste shewe the names

of them, though we haue not as now, their whole workes to shewe. Yf the byshop of Romes lawes, decrees decretals, extrauagantes, clemētines and other suche dregges of the deuyll, yea yf Heytesburyes

But to put our auncient Chronicles, our noble hystoryes, our learned cōmentaryes & homelyes vpō ye scriptures, to so homely an office of subieccyon & vtter contēpte we haue both greatly dishonoured our nacyon, and also shewed our selues very wycked to our posteryte.
               Now lete me returne to my laboriouse serche for olde and new wryters. I haue bene also at Norwyche, oure seconde cytie of name, and there all the library monumētes, and turned to the vse of their grossers, candelmakers

sope sellers, and other worldly occupyers, so studyouse haue we ben there for a cōmen wealth, and so careful of good lernyng, o negligence most vnfryndly to our nacion. I woulde haue bene sory to haue vttered so obscure a facte, had not the vngentilnesse of the thing required it, to the warnyng of them whiche shall come after, for doyng the lyke to the hinderaūce of the realme. As much haue I saued both there & in certē other places of Northfolke and Southfolke cōcerning the authors names & tytles of their workes, as I could, & as much wold I haue done through our ye whole realm, yf I had bene able to haue borne the charges, as I am not.

               THus haue I mynystred here, a taste of my labours, to thē that be fryndely harted to their cō
                  trey and fauorable to good letters, doynge thē therby to know, that I wold do gretter thinges to their honest commodyte, yf I were of power. I haue geuen them a great nombre of the names of their famouse and notable workemē which wrote in this nacyon from age to age, some wele some yll, accordynge to the dyuerse nature of their times, like as the holy Ghost foreiudged of theyr doynges in S. Iohans reuelacion. Yf ye had with the seid names, their actes, their ages, and the tytles of their bokes, whiche I haue now in a redinesse to shew, ye might parauenture se many vnknowne wōders. But yf ye had their whole workes in dede, as they were in substaunce & fashyon, whyche now for the more part are peryshed, ye shoulde haue seane most wonders of all. Their ages are as necessary to be knowne as their doctrynes, and the tytles of their bokes so wele as their manyfest actes, to thē that wyl throughly iudge things

as they are, & not be deceiued by colours
               For what thynge more clerely tryeth the doctrynes of mē, what they are, thā do their ages or times? Either yet, what more proueably manifesteth the goodnesse or euylnesse of their actes, than do the tytles, or argumentes of their workes? He that wyll thus trye Dominick and Frances, the founders of two new relygyons, whiche with their shulders vndrepropped the greate temple of Laterane, or stowte synagoge of Rome, thā fallyng downewardes, as pope Innocent the thirde behelde ones (they saye) in S. Peters churche in a vision, shall fynde the one a murtherer of the bodye the other a murtherer of the sowle, the one an Hypocryte afore God, the other before the world. The other two sectes of begging frires, to apere of an highar perfeccyon, ded fatche their foūdaciōs much farther of, that is to say, from Helias, Mary, and Augustyn, yet coulde they neuer precede them in Hypocresy to dascll the eyes of the worlde for lucre. The boke of Dominickes docrine, no fyer (they say) was able to burne, yet

now whā his vertu shuld be tried therby, it is not vpon the earth to be seane. The doctrine of Fraunces is apparūt to this day, both in his rule & testamēt to be a blasphemouse professyō of hypocresy in the ydolatrouse kingedome of Antichrist.
               Yf these men be proued hypocrites & sowle murtherers, by their execrable doctrines & examples, as they are conferred wyth the noble rules of the pure scriptures, what shall we iudge of all their ydel folowers, eyther yet of theyr frantyck frutes, of vowes, constytucyons, ceremonies, & theyr other fryuolouse obseruaciōs? Yea, what shall we report of those vpholders of Sodomebe they doctours, lawers, iustyces, gē
                  tylmen, or men of other sort, that wyll yet vngentylly contende by sophystycall argumentes voyde of all veryte, those Gomorreal rules and vowes to be so indispensable, that they can geue no place to Gods fre institucyō of marryage? I saye as I thynke, & as I wyll wryte, whan I come ones to the tryeng out of the worthie truthe from theyr execrable

poyson, yt they are neyther learned, wise, nor noble, but vnsauerly smel of their beggerly bagges, whose lowsy wallettes they shake. As the sayeng is, suche lyppes, suche letuce, suche harpe suche melody, bot now to conclude. The vi. viij. ix. and xi. chapters of S. Iohās Apocal. are as a perfighte & sure towch stone, wherby all ages, doctrines, actes & tytles are from tyme to tyme tryed, of what estymacyon and value they apere in Gods sighte, to make vs godly wyse in receyuynge them.
               In the supplecyōs of my. v. hondred of Brytysh & Englysh wryters (of whō I haue not. vi. persones here named) to som one haue I added more thā. lx. workes with their beginnings, to some. xl. to some. xx. to som more, to some lesse, as I haue them collected of the libraryes. Wherin men may behold the diligēce of our forefathers in the tyme of supersticion, & the vntowarde negligence of vs now a dayes in the myddes of learnynge & syght. Yf any men louing the learned fame of their nacyon, do know of more learned wryters than I haue

here, & in thy other boke named (as it is not in my power to trauayle in all quarters, yf 
                     •
                  hey in season sende me the names, tymes, tytles, nombres, and beginninges of theyr workes. I wyl registre thē, as I haue done those. The same wyll I do also, for thē whych ar now liuing, or of late yeares haue deceased, yf I may obtayne the lyke at their handes, to the famouse cōmodyte of Englande in so many noble frutes. Moreouer yf any honest godly mā, English Brityshe, Scottysh or Irysh, haue any Antiquite notable, concernyng hystory (which otherwyse myght peryshe and be loste) yf he for thys good purpose vouchesafe to lende his coppy, he shall not only haue bokes for it, but also in ye ende, the sayde coppy agayne. The grace of our Lorde Iesus Christ, be euermore to them assistent, that loue hys heauēly truth wythoute superstycyon vnfaynedly. Amen.
