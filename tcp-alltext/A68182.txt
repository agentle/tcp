            ¶Of the meruaylles and wondres of
Irlonde. ca. xxviij.
            MAny men tellen yt in the north
ſyde of Irlonde is the londe of
lyf. In that ylonde noman may deye
but whan they ben olde & ben vexed wt
grete ſekenes / they ben borne out in to
the nexte londe & deye there. There is
an other ylonde in Irlonde that no woman
therin may bere a childe / but yet
ſhe may conceyue. Alſo ther is an ylonde
in whiche no deed body may roten.
In vltonia that is Vlſter is an ylonde
in a lake wonderly departed in tweyne
In that one partye is grete dyſturbaū
               ce
& dyſcomfort of fendes / & in yt other
partye grete lykynge & comforte of holy
angels. Ther is alſo ſaynt Patryks
purgatorye yt was ſhewed at his prayers
to conferme his prechynge & his lore
whan he preched to myſbleued men
of ſorowe & payne yt euyll men ſholde
ſuffre for her wycked werkes. And of
Ioye & of blyſſe y• good men ſhall reſceyue
for her holy dedes / he telleth that
who yt ſuffreth the paynes of the purgatorye / yf
it be enioyned hym for penaūce
he ſhall neuer ſuffre the paynes
of helle / but he deye fynally without
repentaūce of ſynne / as the enſample
is ſette more full at this chapytres ende.
¶Treuiſa. But truly noman may
be ſaued but yf he be very repentaunt
what ſomeuer penaūce he do / & euery
man yt is very repentaunt at his lyues
ende ſhall be ſekerly ſaued / though he
neuer here of ſaynt Patryks purgatorye.
There is an ylonde in Connacte
Salo / that is in the ſee of Conaccia / halowed
by ſaynt Brandan that hath
no myſe / there deed bodyes ben not buryed / but
ben kept out of the erthe & roten
not. In Mamonia is a welle / who
y• waſſheth hym wt that water of that
welle he ſhall waxe hore on his heed / There
is an other welle in Vltoma / who
ſomeuer is waſſhen therin he ſhal
neuer wexe hore afterwarde. Ther is
a welle in Mounſtre or Mamoma

That holy ſaynt brought forth theſe
apples by prayers for to hele his childe
that was ſeke. Ther is a lake in Vlſter
& moche fyſſhe therin / whiche is
.xxx. myle in length and .xv. in brede

And there was a welle in y• londe
in grete reuerence of olde tyme / and
alwaye couered / & yf it were lefte vncouered
the welle wolde ryſe & drowne
all the londe. And ſo it happed yt a woman
wente to yt welle for to fetche water
& hyed her faſt to her childe yt wept
in the cradell / & lefte the welle vncouered / thenne
the welle ſprange ſo faſt y•
it drowned the woman & her childe &
made all the coūtree a lake & a fyſſhe
ponde. For to preue that this is ſouth
it is a grete argument / that whan the
weder is clere / fyſſhers of yt water ſe in
the groūde vnder the water roūde toures
& hyghe ſhapen as ſteples & chirches
of that londe. In the north ſyde
of Irlonde in the coūtre of Oſſyryens

Abbot / tweyne y• ben wedded a man &
a woman muſt nedes ben exiled & forſhapen

yf they lyue they come home agayn
& take agayn theyr owne ſhappe / and
thenne ſhall other tweyne go forth in

poole of tree be pyght & ſtycked therin
that parte of the ſhaft or poole y• is in
the erthe ſhall torne in to yron / & that
parte y• abydeth in the water ſhall torne

Alſo ther is a lake y• torneth haſell in

Patryks purgatorye. Ye ſhall vnderſtand
yt the ſeconde ſaynt Patryk that
was abbot & not byſſhop whyle he preched
in Irlonde laboured & ſtudyed for
to torne thylke wycked men that lyued
as beſtes out of her euyll lyf for drede

hem in good lyf / & they ſayd they wolde

                  •
               enne
ſaynt Patryk prayed to god almyghty
therfore / & our lorde Ihu cryſt appyred
to ſaynt Patryk & toke hym a ſtaff &
ladde hȳ in to a wylde place & ſhewed
hym there a rounde pytte yt was derke
within & ſayd / that yf a man were very
repentaūt & ſtable of byleue & went
in to this pytte & walked therin a daye
& a nyght / he ſholde ſee the ſorowes &
the paynes of euyll men / & the Ioye &
blyſſe of good men. Thenne Cryſt vanyſſhed
out of Patryks ſyght / & ſaynt
Patryk arered & buylded there a chirche
& put therin chanons reguler & cloſed
the pytte about with a walle / & is
now in the chirche yerde atte ceſt ende
of the chirche & faſt ſhytte wt a ſtronge
dore. For no man ſholde nycely go
in without leue of y• byſſhop / or of the
pryour of the place. Many men wente
in & come out agayne in Patryks tyme
& tolde of paynes & Ioye that they
had ſeen / & the meruaylles yt they ſawe
ben their yet wryten / & by cauſe therof

many men torned & were conuerted to
ryght byleue. Alſo many men went in
& come neuer agayne. In kyng Stephens
tyme kynge of Englonde a
knyght that hyght Owayne wente in
to ſaynt Patryks purgatorye & come
agayne & dwelled euer after durynge
his lyf in the nedes of thabbaye of Ludenſis
that is of thorder of Chyſtews
& tolde many wondres y• he had ſeen in
Patryks purgatorye. The place is called
Patryks purgatorye & the chirche
is named Reglis. Noman is enioyned
for to go in to yt purgatorye / but coū
               ſeylled
that he ſholde not come therin
but take vpon hȳ other penaūce. And
yf a man haue auowed & be ſtable &
wyll nedes go therin / he ſhall fyrſt go
to the byſſhop & then̄e he ſhal be ſente
with letters to the pryour of the place
& they both ſhall coūſeyll hym to leue
and yf he wyll nedes go therto he ſhal
be in prayers & in faſtynge .xv. dayes
& after .xv. dayes he ſhall be houſeld &
ladde to the dore of the purgatorye wt 
proceſſyon & letanye / & yet he ſhall be
coūſeylled to leue it / & yf he be ſtedfaſt
& wyll entre / the dore ſhal be opened &
he bleſſyd & go in on goddes name / &
holde forth his waye / & the dore ſhall
be faſt ſhette tyll the next daye / and
whan the tyme is the pryour ſhall come
& opene the dore / & yf the man be
comen he ledeth hym in to the chirche
with proceſſyon / & there he ſhal be .xv.
dayes in pryers & faſtynge.
         
         
            ¶Of the meruaylles of ſayntes of
Irlonde ca. xxix.
            HEre Giraldus maketh mynde
that as men of this nacyon ben
more angry than other men and more
haſty for to take wretche whyles they
ben a lyue / ſo ſayntes and halowes of
this londe ben more wretchefull than
ſaȳtes of other londes. Clerkes of this
londe ben chaſte & ſayen many prayers

all nyght / ſo is acoūted for a myracle / that
lechery regneth not there as
wyne regneth / & they that ben euyll of
them ben worſt of all other. So good
men amonge them though they ben
but fewe ben good at the beſt / prelates
of that coūtree ben full ſlowe in correccyon
of treſpas / & beſy in contemplacyon
& not in prechynge of goddes
worde. Therfore it is y• all the ſayntꝭ
of yt londe ben confeſſours & no martyr
amonge them / & no wonder for al
the prelates of this londe ben choſen
out of abbayes in to the clergye & done

ſo many ſayntes ben in Irlonde & neuer

they leye neuer honde but do hem grete
