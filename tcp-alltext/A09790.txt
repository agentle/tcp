            According there vnto it is writen of one named Cleophantus, son of the noble duke Themystocles,

whiche for his prowes was soueraynly estemed and beloued of the people of Athenes, the sayd Cleophantus auanted hym selfe, where he was in company, that what so euer he wold, his moder wold the same, and what she desired, his fader Themistocles graunted, and what pleased Themistocles, the people was therwith contented. The noble hartes of Lacedemones (whiche are a people in Grece) be worthy to be highly extolled, who compelled their kynge named Archidamus / to pay to them a great somme of money, for that be maried a woman of small stature and personage embraidinge hym, that he purposed not to get them kynges, but only a linage of kynges (as it were that in a kynge ought to be good features and maiestie.) Consequently one thyng is to be remēbred, whiche hath not ben forgoten of our elders: what suppose you that is? Certainly, that they which do accompany with women, to

            ¶Of nature / reson & custome / which shulde concurre in the educacion of children. Cap. ii.
            GEnerally accordynge as we haue ben vsed to trayte of concernynge artis and sciences, the same shall we now eftsones reherce in the declaracion of vertue. Thre thinges ther be that must cōcurre & agre in the accōplishing & perfecting of the warke, which I now purpose, that is to say Nature, Reason, and Custome. Reason I take for doctrine, Custome for exercise. The begynninge and entre is to be taken of doctrine, Experience is won by meditacion & exercise. Of all those togyder is made a perfection: And where any of them do lacke or fayle, nedes must vertue halte. For Nature without doctrine is blynde, & doctrine without Nature is a thinge mutilate. Nedes muste than exercise (which lacketh them both) be imperfecte. For lyke as in tyllage fyrste it behoueth that the moulde (whiche is to be sowen) be good. Secondarily that the husbande or ploughman be experte in sowinge. Thirdely that the sede be clene and withoute fau

Doutles he is in great felicite and in the fauour of god, who that is indewed with all these qualities. But who so euer after that he hath attayned to doctrine and the right experiēce to vertue, do suppose the wyt of man not to be profitable, he doth nat qualifie the defaultes of Nature, but vtterlye erreth and is deceyued. For slouth destroyeth the power of nature, and she her selfe by doctrine is distroyed. And light thinges fleeth from men that be negligent: and nothing is so 
                  •
               ifficile, but by cure it is optained. Also you shal lightly perceiue in many thynges (if ye take good hede) what spedynes & efficacie is in labour and diligence. For the small droppes of water (with often fallyng) perce the stones. Iron and brasse is worne out with moche occupatiō. And the wheles of chariottes bowed by moche violence, can neuer recouer their pristinat streightnes. yet labour (excedyng the cours of nature) hath surmoūted her power. But suppose you these thinges only declareth the power of diligence 
                  •
                nay truly, but also other thinges innumerable. If a grounde fertile of nature be yll housbandried / for lacke of good tillage it appereth foule and yl fauored: and the more excellent the nature of euerye thynge is, the more is loste / 

if bit perysshe by slouthe or negligence. Is your grounde barayne and out of measure rough and vntylthy? Tyll it well: and good spente, cometh agayne of it. Howe many trees be ther, that beynge lytell set by / abydeth barayne: And whan they be duely attended and cherysshed, they become fertile? what strengthe of body is nat dulled and consumed by sluggardye, wantonnesse, and yll rule? Or what bodyes be so feble of Nature, that by exercyse and doyng of maistries be not auaunced to more strength and prowes? Semblablye, what horse welle broken in youthe is not after to the ryder gentyll and easye? And they that be roughe and yll broken, be not they verye harde beeded and fyers of stomake? But what nede we to meruayle at suche other thynges, whan we se often tymes beastis most sauage and cruell / to be broken and made tame with labours? One of Thessalie (whiche is a countrey naturally inclined to warre) answered well whā it was demaunded of hym, who were moost abiecte of all the people of Thessaly, he sayde, they whiche in feates of warre be not exercised. what shall nede many wordes? Custome is a thynge auncient and of longe continuance. And he that customably haunteth his owne propre and familiar vertues, shal nat erre in any wise. Touching whiche matter, after one exaumple rehersed, I shal cesse to speake any more of these thinges. Lycurgus (whiche made and gaue lawes to the people called Spartanes of Lacedemones) for

to proue the efficacie of custome, caused .ii. whelpes to be taken and brought vp in sondrye maners / thone to be made a rauenour and re

               beles, thother chaste, suer in lyam, and to hunte truely. That done, on a tyme whan the people were in one place assembled, Lycurgus sayde vnto them: O ye Lacedemones, for to gete and attayne vnto vertue, custome, discipline, doctryne, and good bryngynge vp, be of great effecte and substaunce: Of the whiche I shall vnto you anone, make experience. And forthewith, bryngynge before them the whelpes, whiche he kepte: whan he hadde sette betwene them a potte with meate and a quicke hare, thone whelpe egerly flewe to the hare, thother with as moche haste or more, thraste his heed in to the potte. And whan the people in no wyse coude coniecte what this thinge purported, or wherfore the whelpes were brought forthe: Frendes sayde Lycurgus, bothe these whelpes, hauynge one syre and one damme, by custome be trayned in to sondrye disposicions: for the one is become a rauenour, the other a good hunter. Nowe haue we sufficiently spoken of the lyfe and custome of men, here after we shall treate of the Educacion and bryngynge vp of chyldren.

Also there was in hym a high and wyse prouidēce, whiche gaue vnto women two pappes: that if hit happened any to brynge forthe twynnes, she shulde haue double fountaynes to noryshe them: whiche was done for great consideration, that therby loue and beneuolence may be noris

               hed & encreased betwene them and theyr children. For familiar company in liuynge and fedynge is an encreace of loue and amitye. Therfore it is to be obserued principally that moders (as I haue before rehersed) do brīg vp their owne childrē & giue them souke of their propre brestes, or if they can not for some disease or manyfest impediment that they may happen to haue: Or if they lyste not, for that they wolde haue plenty of children, than wolde I that they

shulde take honeste and conuenient nources, and not brothels and vagaboundes, but suche as he instruct in the maners of theyr propre realme or countrey. For in lyke wise as the membres of infantes newly borne, muste be formed and ordred that they become not croked: so the maners of them at theyr begynnynge / muste be aptly and properly framed. For that very yonge age is teeē
               der and facile to be wrought: & lernynge is beste instylled and brought in wittes, whiles they be softe and delycate. Also thynges beynge longe harde, vnneth be mollified: therfore lernynge in childrens wittes is soonest impressed. wherfore Plato, whiche is called the deuine philosopher, discretely exhorteth nources, that they committe not to children tryfelynge and dishonest fables, lest at the begynnynge they infecte theyr wyttes with foly, and vnthrifty maners. Therfore the poet Phoci
                  •
               ides in this wyse counsayleth:

                  Infourme thy childe in yonge and tender age.
                  To gentyll maners the very tyght passage.
               
Also hit ought not to be forgotten, that you prouide suche parsones to accompany or attende vpon your children, as be all redy instructe in vertuous maners, and can perfectly and truely speke and pronounce your countrey language / lest if they be intached with barbarous speche and depryued maners, your children shulde enbrace of them some vicious disposicion. For not without reason this prouerbe is vsed: He that dwelleth by a crepyll, shall lerne to halte. But after your

chyldren be comen to yeres, whan they shuld be cōmytted to Tutours, than for the remenaunt of theyr educacion you muste be circumspecte, that you do not cōmytte the gouernaunce of them to slaues or villaynes, or to men vnstable, false, or deceitfull. For they may well be laught to scorne that at this day, hauynge good and discrete seruauntes, appoynteth some to be theyr hyndes, some shypmen, some to be factours, other to be stewardes of house holde, baylyffes of husbandrye / surueyours of landes, or receyuours: And if they haue a ribaulde or a riottous seruaunte / vnprofitable to euerye purpose, communly to his gouernaunce they do commytte theyr chyldren. A good and necessarye tutoure ought to be suche as was Phenyx (tutoure of Achilles the moste valiaunt of all the Grekes, whiche were at the siege of Troye) whom Peleus fader of Achilles (as Homere the noble poete wryteth) ordeyned to haue the rule of his sonne, to the entent that (for his wysedome and eloquence) he shulde be as well in speakynge as doynge his instructour and mayster.

               NOwe come I to the thynge most chieffe and pryncipall to be remembred. ye muste dilygently prouyde for youre chylderne, schole maysters / whose lyues be not disposed to vice, ne of reprocheable maners or conditions, and whiche haue good experyence and fourme of teachynge. For certaynly the fountayne and roote of worshyppe and honestye, is good doctrine. For lykewyse as good husbandes do pyche busshes and bedges aboute yonge settes (as well to thentente they shulde growe streyght / as to kepe them from bytynge and barkynge of catall) so good and perfecte maysters plant in children conuenable and good aduertisementes and preceptes, wherby the yonge spryng of vertuous maners shall growe streyghte, and be out of daungerous and beastly vice. And trulye many fathers there be, whiche are greatelye to be blamed, that commytte theyr childerne to vnthrifty, ignoraunte, and folysshe maysters, not hauynge of them before any tryall or experience / whiche al be it they so do in defaulte of lernyng, yet is it in them great foly and symplenesse: For some there be, that notwithstandynge by the reporte of men experte, they knowe the ignorance and lewdnes of some schole maysters, and do perceyue hit manifestely: yet vnto them speciallye they commende their sonnes: and some do bit, beynge vanquysshed with fayre promyses, other at the instant desyre and in fauour of theyr frendes

and acqueyntance: where in they do moche lyke, us if a man beynge sycke or diseased, dothe refuse an experte phisition / whiche may recouer hym, & for to haue the more fauour of his frende or acquayntaunce, taketh a manne vnlerned, by whom perchance he shall be brought in danger of his lyfe: or beinge on the see, forsaketh a good pilate or lodisman, and at the desire of his frende or acquayntaunce, approueth a persone folysshe and ignoraunt. O lorde god, is he to be called a fader, that more estemeth the desire of his neighbour, than the erudition and lerning of his chyldren? Accordyng thervnto the olde philosopher Crates was wonte to saye, that whan he shulde happen to be in the hyghest parte of the citie, he wolde crie in this fourme (if he myght be herde) whither wyll ye mad men, whiche do set al your study in gettyng of riches / and to your children, to whome ye wyll leaue that ryches, ye haue no consideration or respect? And to that in myn opinion may be added, that suche fathers do in lyke wise, as they which be very busy and nice in trimmyng their showes, whan they take lytel regard what hapneth to their feete.
            There be also many parentes, in whom in ordinate loue of money hath ingendred hate of their naturall children: for to thentent that they wyll nat gyue great rewarde or salarye, they do prouyde maysters for their children, ignoraunt persones, whiche for a lyttell stypende professeth lernynge of small estimation. And therfore the philosopher

Aristippus sauerly and with a propre taunte checked one beinge a fader, whiche lacked witte. For one demaunded of Aristippus, what bewolde aske for a rewarde to teache his sonne: who demaunded .xx.li. O sayd he, that is a sore demaūde, for I maye bye a seruant at that pryce (seruauntes at that tyme were bonde men, and beinge taken in warres were solde, as slaues he nowe in diuers places) ye sayde Aristippus, thou shalte haue for thy money two seruauntes, that is to saye thy sonne, and hym whome thou doste bye. As who saythe, the money whiche shulde purchase his son lerninge, beinge enployed on a slaue, maketh his son for lacke of lerninge, to be of lyke estate or cōdicion. Finally is it not a great foly & madnes / that where we do accustome our chyldren to take meate with the ryght hande, & if they do put forthe the lefte hāde, anone we correct them: and for to make them to here good & commodious lernynges, we make no prouision nor be circumspecte therin?

Nowe to speake in fewe wordes / wherein I shall seme rather to dyuyne than to admoneste and exhorte, The fyrste, myddell,

and laste poynte of this matter is, that the sure and honest rule of liuynge is lernynge. And that is the thyng, whiche soonest helpeth a man to vertue: All other thynges temporall be but tryfils, and not of suche value, that there in we oughte to spende any studye. Doubtles nobilite or gentylnes of bloud is a goodlye thynge: and ryches is a thynge precious and delectable: but the gyftes of Fortune be suche, that as we may se by experience, she gyueth them, where they be not loked fore: and those whiche alredy haue them, she dispoyleth. More ouer great substance is a token or pray to allure seruauntes and other parsones ylle disposed / to wayte a man with displeasure, and to enserche his cofers and baggis. And finally they be redy for euery lewde person, that may happe to take them. Honoure is pleasaunt, but it is vnstable and nothynge constaunt. Beautie is a thynge excellente, and for the attaynynge therof, moche debate hath ensurged: but yet it is transitorie, and dureth but a season. Bodilye helthe is a treasure, but that is also mutable. Strengthe is moche desyred, and is taken for a parte of felicitie: yet notwithstandynge hit soone fadeth, with age or sykenesse. And he that auaunteth hym selfe in myght of body and lymmes, is in a false opinion. For howe small a porcion of strength is in man, in comparison of beastis: I meane elephauntes, bulles, and lyons? Therfore truely the thynge that in vs is diuyne and immortall is lernynge. Generally two speciall

thynges be in the nature of manne / whiche be good, that is to saye, knowlege and reasone. Knowlege commaundeth, reasone dothe obeye. As for knowlege no violence of Fortune maye take awaye / no vexation maye withdrawe, nor sickenes may corrupt / nor age by any meane may endomage. Onely knowlege perisshed with age eftsones reuiueth. And where all other thynges by longe contynuance decaye, onely counnynge with the yeres encreseth and multiplieth. warre lyke a raginge floode, draweth and carieth away all thynges with hym, onely lernynge, for that he may not stere it, he leaueth vntouched. wherfore Stilpo the philosopher, as me semeth, made answere necessarye to be remembred. For whan kynge Demetrius had taken the citie of Megarie, where Stilpo dwelled, and abated hit in to the erthe: he demaunded of Stilpo, if he hadde loste any of his goodes by the assault? No sayd Stilpo, warres maye neuer take any spoyle of vertue. Accordynge hit semeth that Socrates answered. For whan Gorgias the Rhetorician (as I remembre me) demaunded of hym, if he thoughte the kynge of Perse to be happye: I knowe nat sayd he, howe moche he hath of vertue and lernynge. As who saythe, in those thynges standeth happynesse, and not in the treasure and gyftes of Fortune.

For that, whiche is spoken or done vnaduysedly and hastily / in no wyse maye be cōmēdable. For it is said in a prouerbe: Good thinges are difficile. And wordes not forestudied be infarced with lyghtnesse and negligence, and vnneth suche perceyue wher at to begynne, or where they shal make their conclusion. Amonge other faultes they that speake hastily, falle in to bablynge immoderate, but aduysed meditation suffreth not langage to wandre out of due measure. we rede of Pericles (one of the noble coū

Perchaunce some wyll saye, this tale is nat trewe, and that I speake it without auctorite. Al be it in his oration agaynst Midea, he declareth the cōmodite of premeditation in this fourme: Frendes I deny not, but I haue consydered, what I shall saye, and that I shall speake is with great labour prouyded. ye might well pytie me, If I shulde come before you prepared, that I shuld omytte and passe ouer that thing, which I entende to declare.

            NOwe to returne to mi first matter. My counsayle is that chyldren do eschewe to moche arrogaunt and pompous speche: and in like wise to auoyde homely and rude communicacion. Inflate and proude speche lacketh gentyllnesse: base and vile wordes nothynge perswadethe or moueth. For like as the body ought not only to be hoole from sickenes, but also to be of good habilite or facion: so shulde the oracion or sentence not be onely not sicke, but also firme and substanciall. For that thynge whiche is sure, is onely commendable: & that whiche is exployted with daunger we commun

               ly wonder at. And like opinion haue I in disposynge the mynde: For hit becomethe not a childe eyther to be shrewde and folehardy, or to be cowarde and temerous. The one shall cause hym to be shameles: the other to be of vile courage and dastarde. The meane waye to holde in euery thynge, it is a high and perfecte crafte. Al be it I eftsones do remembre lernynge, yet what I deme therin, I wyll at this tyme differre. But to retourne to speakynge / To be contented with one onely membre or fourme of speakynge, and not to poli
                  •
               he it with sondrie clauses or sentenses

hit is a great token of ignoraunce. For to speake alway one thynge hit is nowe and thanne tedious and intollerable. For one note of synginge, and one acte in an Interlude withoute variacion, is to the syngers & playours laborious, and to the herers fulsome & tedyous. Therfore pleasaunt varietie is in euery thynge delectable: mooste specially in voyces, and thynges made to beholde. Therfore in yonge men of good stocke, nothynge shulde lacke, worthye to be harde or sene. And to say the trouthe, there shulde be in them that, whiche menne calle the Cercle of lernynge. But yet that is onely as it were to be tasted (takynge of euery doctrine some parte) perusynge them through at the fyrste syghte. For it is almost impossible to be perfecte in all thynges. All be it philosophy of al studies ought to be soueraygne and had in moost reuerence: wherin I wyll declare myn opinion, by a similitude.
            For lyke as it is a pleasant and goodly thynge in passynge the sees to come to dyuers worldes and countreyes, so to inhabyte and dwelle in the beste of them / hit is a thynge excellently commodious and moste hyghest to be estemed. Veryly hit was a propre sayenge of Byas the philosopher, that as the wowars of Penelope (wyfe of Vlysses, whiche in the ten yeres absence of her husbande, honorably susteyned her selfe chaste ageynste the importune sute of many valyaunte princes) coude not haue with her vnlefull companye, they medled with the wenches and drudges

of her house. In lyke wyse some parsones, whiche can not atteygne to philosophye, as hi
                  •
                were men vnapte and desperate, do languysshe and spende their tyme in other lernynges of no pryce or estimation. wherfore doubtles philosophie is to be preferred as princesse of al other doctrines. The wytte and studye of man hath dyuysed a double science or knowlege for the good gouernaunce of the body, that is to saye phisike and exercise: Of the whiche, the one bryngeth helth, thother good habite or personage: onely they gryues and diseases of the soule and mynde, phylosophye cureth and maketh hoole. By her may be knowen what is honest, what is dishonest, what ryght, what wronge: and generally what is to be enlued, what to be eschewed: how your parentes / your frendes, your soueraynes, your wyues and seruauntes, men in auctoritie and straungers ought to be vsed and enterteygned. More ouer, howe we shulde honoure god, worshyppe our parentes, reuerence our betters, obey the lawes, suffre and gyue place to men hauyng auctorities. Also howe we ought to fauour our frendes, to loue womenne with measure, to holde dere our children, not to be of seruile condicion: & aboue all other, not to reioice to moche of prosperite, nor to be oppressed with sorowe in aduersitie / n

                to be enclyned to voluptuosite, neither by to moche wrath make our mindes beastly. whiche thynges be the chieffe and principall commodities or treasure of philosophie. Hit is

the office or duetie of a gentyll man / to vse well good fortune, of a man well brought vppe to eschewe enuie, of a man wyse and assured, to vanquyshe his appitites and desyres, with reason: And to refrayne or ouercome anger, hit is the parte of a man not abiecte nor of small discrecion or vertue. But to my purpose, They ben assured and perfecte men, whiche can myxe polytike wysedome with philosophie. And I dare affirme, they do therby obteyne double commoditie. That is to wete, they do leade theyr life to the cōmune weale of theyr countrey: And also they do passe theyr tyme in studies of wysedome and vertue, with quietnesse of mynde, neuer ouer flowen with the wawes of fortune. For wher there be thre maner of lyues, one called Actife, the other contemplatife, the thyrde voluptuous or sensuall, the laste beinge vicious and seruaunt to pleasure, apperteyneth to beastis, and men of no reputation or goodnesse. The actife lyfe, lackynge philosophie, is of littell purpose, and is in sondry errours enuolued. The contemplatife life (concernynge man) if hit be natioyned with the actiue, hit is of none effecte or profite. Therfore let vs endeuour our selfes, that the cōmune weale may be applied, and also philosophie obteyned, as accordynge to the tyme hit shall seme moste expedient. In this wyse Pericles (the noble counsailour of Athenes) dyd his duetie to the cōmune weale o

                his countre. So dyd Architas in Tarcut, Dyon in Sicile, and Epaminondas

in Thebes: of whom two the last were scholers to Plato, the prince of philosophers. what shal I nede to tarye longer aboute doctryne / excepte that besydes that we haue all redy spoken, one thynge is conuenient and also necessary to be remembred, that is, that yonge men endeuoure them to gette the bokes of olde wryters, and in gatheryng of them, to folowe and be lyke to the ploughman. For as the feate of tyllage is kepte by occupyenge of the grounde, and nat onely by hauynge of plowes and other store of housbandrie: in lyke wyse the instrument of lernynge is not only possession of bokes, but also exercise and practise of the same.
         
         
            Of the commodite of vertuous exercise. Cap. viii.
            EXercyse is not a lyttell to be estemed / and for that purpose children muste also be commytted to maysters, whiche maye exercise them sufficientlye, to the intente that thereby, good shappe of lymmes and membres & strengthe of bodye maye be acquired. For the good habitie and disposition in the bodyes of chylderne, is for age a sure fundation.
            And as in somer and fayre wether men prouide agaynste wynter: so the best prouision for age, is good maners and temperance goten in youth.

Also labour is to be kepte in, as it were in a closet or selle, and so moderatly vsed, that children beynge tendre and flexible, be not in study ouermoche fatigated. For as Plato sayth, laboure and slepe be ennemyes to lernynge. But what nede I to tarye here vpon, seynge that I pourpose to declare that whiche is more necessarye to speake of. It shall be most expedient to exercise children in feates of armes, as in rydynge and chasyng, castynge of iauelyns and dartes, shotynge in the longe bowe, and suche other marcial actes, wher in the vanquiss hours appoynt for their rewarde to haue the goodes of them that be vāquysshed. All be hit warre lyttell estemeth the parsonage brought vp in the shadowe. The pure and leane souldiour, alwayes hauntynge the affayres of warre, oftē times ouerthroweth the great wrastler in bataile, and enforceth the front all redy imbatayled to recule. what is that to the purpose, sayth some man to me? For where thou dyddest promyse to gyue aduertisementes, concernynge the bryngynge vp of honest mens children, not withstandynge thou passest ouer poure men and the cōmune people, that thou goest aboute to instructe onely ryche menne and nobles. whervnto it is no great difficultie to replie. Certeynly myn entent is, that my exhortation shulde be cōmune and also profitable to euery man. But if any be of suche pouertie, that he is not able to vse this my counsayle, he shal blame fortune and not me, that do the best I can to aduise hym. It is to be

assayed with all that may be, that the beste ways of bryngynge vp of chyldren may be knowen also to poure men: and at the leste to do that that is possible. And these be the moste sorest obiections that be in this matter. Nowe frō hensforth I purpose to adde therto the sure and streyghte way howe yonge men shulde be instructed.
         
         
            ¶ A moderate direction to prouoke children to lerne. And of the folye of indiscrete fathers. Cap. ix.
            I Do affirme surely in myne opinion, chyldren oughte not to be brought to honest exercise, by beatynge and strokes, but by exhortacion and reasonyng. For punisshement is meter for villaynes and slaues / than for them that be franke or of gentill bloud: whiche with trauaile be hardned, and some tyme beinge aferde of the whippe / applieth them to labour. But children of gentyll nature take more profite by praise or lyghte rebuke, than by stripes. For praises stere them to worshyp, and rebuke doth withdrawe them from folye. wherfore it requireth at sondry tymes to myngle sharpe wordes with praises. After ye haue strongely rebuked, than to prouoke them to shamefastnes, and eftesones to reuoke their corages with prayses: and therin nources are to be folowed, whiche whan they haue made theyr children to wepe, furthewith

with they do gyue vnto them theyr pappes, therby for to styll them. But beware gyue them not to many prayses, le
                  •
               te they take therby to moche courage and presumption: and with to moche cockenayenge be spylled and lost. I haue knowen many faders, whom to moche loue hath caused, that they loued not their children. But what may I say, to tell it more playnlyer? For where they make haste, that their chyldren may the soner excel other, they do put vnto them infynite labours, wherof beynge werye and oppressed with intollerable paynes, fynallye they fynde lyttell pleasure or swetenes in lernynge. A lyttell water maketh herbes to growe, and with to moche they be soone glutted. In lykewyse the mynde with moderate labour is quickened, and with inordinate labours is oppressed and drowned. wherfore in studyes and labours some recreacion is to be gyuen to children. For we must remembre / that al our lyfer deuided in to study and reste. And therfore not onely watche is necessarie, but also slepe: not batayle only, but also peace: not wynter and stormes, but also fayre wether and somer: not onely warke dayes, but also hygh feastes and holy dayes: and generally ydelnes and reste is sauce vnto labour: and that may you perceyue not onely in thynges hauynge lyfe, but also in those thynges that lacke life.

            ¶Of the exercises of memorye / and of the thre excellent continences of the tounge, wrathe, and the handes. Cap. x.
            ABoue all thynges the memorie of chylderne is to be exercised and kepte in vsage: for that is as hit were the store house of lernynge. wherfore in aunciente fables, Memorie is named the mother of Muses (whiche as poetes write, were fynders of all sciences liberalle) therby declarynge, that nothynge nexte

to nature may bringe fourth so moche as memorie. Therfore that is to be exercised in euery part wether the childe be retentife of memorie or obliuious. And if it shall happe that some be more excellēt than other, we ought to corroborate the habundaunce of nature: And where they be oppressed with dulnes, to amende and supply the defaulte or lacke. And therfore the poete Hesiodus marueilously well sayth:

                  If to a lytell thou addest a lyttell more
                  In space of tyme thou shalle haue mykell store.
               
Let not this be forgoten of parentes, that the parte of doctrine concernynge memorie, is not onely a great porcion of lernynge, but also of other necessaries to mans lyfe apperteignynge. And verily remembraunce of a

And in leauyng al other, it shal suffise to remembre one or two, in settynge out of this matter. Kynge Alexander the great conquerour, cōmanded the Grekes to ordeyn garmentes of purple, that whan he returned from his conqueste, they myght in that apparaile honour his victory that he had agaynst them of the orient, with solemne sacrifice: The people for that entent paying heed siluer: One Theocrite a philsopher sayd to Alexander: I haue ben a great whyle in doute, but nowe I perceiue clerely by the sayeng of Homer, that this shalbe thy purple deth. By which wordes he brought him selfe ī to the high indignatiō of Alexander. The same Theocrite embraydinge king Antigonus who had but one eie / with blindnes: prouoked hym to displesure. For on a tyme kynge Antigonus had commanded to come vnto him one Eutropion his mayster coke, which was also a capitayne in his armye / to reken with hym concernynge his office, which the sayd Theocrite

often tymes came and shewed to Eutropion, and seynge hym make no haste, sayd vnto hym: I se well thou wylte serue me in rawe to Cyclops. In which wordes be enbraided the king with blindnes, and the capitayne Etropyon with cokerye. Therfore sayde Eutropion / thou shalte lose thy heed / and suffre penaunce for thy bablynge and rayshenes, and furthwith shewed the wordes to the kyng, who in his fury immediatly sent one to slee Theocrite. But er I procede any further, I wyl shewe the historie of Cyclops, which is here remembred, that the taunt or rebuke gyuen by Theocrite may the better be vnderstande. After that the citie of Troye was destroyed, the Grekes laded with inestimable riches prepared their returne into their countreys, amonge whom the wyse and eloquent Vlisses, by whose policie the Grekes had exployted their affaires, trauayled lōge on the sees: to whom did happē maruailous and strange aduentures. Of the whiche one the most wonderfull was, that by tempest he and his company were dryuen through two daungerous passages: wherof one was a great and horrible rocke named Scilla: the other a gulfe or swalow called Charibdis: and finally arryued in Sicile, whiche at that tyme was named Trinacria, and was onely inhabyted with monsterous people, whiche were of great & huge stature like geauntes, and had but one eie, whiche was great and rounde, in the middes of their forheed, and were called Cyclopes. The chiefe or capitayne of them

was named Polyphemus, who excelled al the other in enormitie of stature. As Vlisses & diuers of his cōpany were entred into the Isle to reste & solace them after their trauaile, they were incontynent deprehēded by the said Ciclopes, & caried into the horrible caues or dēnes made in the rockes: where the giantes did eate the said Grekes rawe, and like to raueninge wolfes / crushed the heedis & bones of men betwene their tethe, that the braynes & marowe dropped downe by theyr mouthes. Suche was the terrible power and rauyne of the Ciclopes. But whan Vlisses perceyued the imminent perill that he was in, he with most swete & delectable wordes appesed the rage of Polyphemus the giante / that toke him, who heringe the wonderfull eloquence of Vlisses, demanded of him his name, and he answered, that he was called Noman. The giant delited & had moche pleasure at the beautie and eloquence of Vlisses, whiche he perceiuinge, gaue vnto the giant a delectable potion, wherof he toke suche abundance, that he became therwith dronke, and fell into a d

slepe, that he therwith coude not awake. As Vlisses perceiued that he had made blynd the giant, be with all haste returned to his shippes & set vp all the sayles, & passed with all hast possible into the mayne see. After that Polyphemus was waked, and than felte great peyne of his wounde, & that he had vtterly lost his eie, perceyuynge that he was betrayed by Vlisses, he supposynge Vlisses had ben yet in his denne or caue stode vp spredyng his armes before the hole of the caue, thinkynge to kepe therin Vlisses: but whan he had longe tyme so taried, & at the laste perceiued that he was fledde, he wandred in to the Ile rorynge with a terrible voyce: wherwith there repaired vnto hym the other Ciclopes or giauntes / and seynge hym sore hurt and bledyng demanded him who had so hurted & woūded him: And he said

And Vlisses by his eloquence and excellent witte escaped from being eate by the giantes. By this fable it appereth, that Theocrite by namynge of Ciclops, noted and inbrayded kynge Antigonus with crueltie and also with his blemysshe of one eie.
