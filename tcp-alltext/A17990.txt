                  A Preface to the skillfull Musician.
                  SInce I am come in the view of the world, I had rather commit
the first fruits of these my labours to your iudiciall opinions,
then generally to the common censure of the ignorant:
knowing you will fauourably conceale or amend what is amisse
and giue the rest their due, (if they shall deserue any thing at all)
I haue laboured somewhat to imitate the Italian, they beeing in
these dayes (with the most) in high request, yet may I not nor
cannot forget that I am an English man. So wishing to you as to
my selfe I ende. From Norwich the xxviij. of March. 1601.

                  SInce I am come in the view of the world, I had rather commit
the first fruits of these my labours to your iudiciall opinions,
then generally to the common censure of the ignorant:
knowing you will fauourably conceale or amend what is amisse
and giue the rest their due, (if they shall deserue any thing at all)
I haue laboured somewhat to imitate the Italian, they beeing in
these dayes (with the most) in high request, yet may I not nor
cannot forget that I am an English man. So wishing to you as to
my selfe I ende. From Norwich the xxviij. of March. 1601.

                  SInce I am come in the view of the world, I had rather commit
the first fruits of these my labours to your iudiciall opinions,
then generally to the common censure of the ignorant:
knowing you will fauourably conceale or amend what is amisse
and giue the rest their due, (if they shall deserue any thing at all)
I haue laboured somewhat to imitate the Italian, they beeing in
these dayes (with the most) in high request, yet may I not nor
cannot forget that I am an English man. So wishing to you as to
my selfe I ende. From Norwich the xxviij. of March. 1601.

                  SInce I am come in the view of the world, I had rather commit
the first fruits of these my labours to your iudiciall opinions,
then generally to the common censure of the ignorant:
knowing you will fauourably conceale or amend what is amisse
and giue the rest their due, (if they shall deserue any thing at all)
I haue laboured somewhat to imitate the Italian, they beeing in
these dayes (with the most) in high request, yet may I not nor
cannot forget that I am an English man. So wishing to you as to
my selfe I ende, From Norwich the xxviij. of March. 1601.
