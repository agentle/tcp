            THE SHOMAKERS Holiday. OR The Gentle Craft.
            With the humorous life of Simon Eyre, shoomaker, and Lord Maior of London.
            As it was acted before the Queenes most excellent Maiestie on New yeares day at night last, by the right honourable the Earle of Notingham, Lord high Admirall of England, his seruants.

               To all good Fellowes, Professors of the Gentle Craft; of what degree soeuer.
            
            
               KInde Gentlemen, and honest boone Companions, I present you here with a merrie conceited Comedie, called the Shoomakers Holyday, acted by my Lorde Admiralls Players this present Christmasse, before the Queenes most excellent Maiestie. For the mirth and pleasant matter, by her Highnesse graciously accepted; being indeede no way offensiue. The Argument of the play I will set downe in this Epistle: Sir Hugh Lacie Erle of Lincolne, had a yong Gentleman of his owne name, his nere kinsman, that loued the Lorde Maiors daughter of London; to preuent and crosse which loue, the Earle caused his kinsman to be sent Coronell of a companie into France: who resigned his place to another gentleman his friend, and came disguised like a Dutch Shoomaker, to the house of Symon Eyre in Tower streete, who serued the Maior and his houshold with shooes. The merriments that passed in Eyres house, his comming to be Maior of London, Lacies getting his loue, and other accidents; with two merry Three-mens songs. Take all in good worth that is well intended, for nothing is purposed but mirth, mirth lengthneth long life which, with all other blessings I heartily wish you.
            
               Farewell.
            
         
         
            
            The first Three-mans Song.
            
               O the month of Maie, the merrie month of Maie,
               So frolicke, so gay, and so gréene, so gréene, so gréene:
               O and then did I, unto my true loue say,
               Swate Peg, thou shalt be my Summers Quéene.
            
            
               NOw the Nightingale, the prettie Nightingale,
               The sweetest singer in all the Forrests quier:
               Intreates thée swéete Peggie, to heare thy true loues tale,
               Loe, yonder she sitteth, her breast against a brier.
            
            
               But O I spie the Cuckoo, the Cuckoo, the Cuckoo,
               Sée where she sitteth, come away my ioy:
               Come away I prithee, I do not like the Cuckoo
               Should sing where my Peggie and I kisse and toy.
            
            
               O the month of Maie, the merrie month of Maie,
               So frolike, so gay, and so gréene, so gréene, so gréene:
               And then did I, unto my true loue say,
               Swéete Peg, thou shalt be my Summers Quéene.
            
         
         
            
            The Second Three-mans Song.
            This is to be sung at the latter end.
            
               COld's the wind, and wet's the raine,
               Saint Hugh be our good spéede:
               Ill is the weather that bringeth no gaine,
               Nor helpes good hearts in néede.
            
            
               Trowle the boll, the iolly Nut-browne boll,
               And here kind mate to thée:
               Let's sing a dirge for Saint Hughes soule,
               And downe it merrily.
            
            
               Downe a downe, hey downe a downe,
               Hey derie derie down a down,
               
                  Close with the tenor boy:
               Ho well done, to me let come,
               King compasse gentle ioy.
            
            
               Trowle the boll, the Nut-browne boll,
               And here kind &c as often as there be men to drinke.
               
            
            
               
                  At last when all haue drunke, this verse.
               
               Cold's the wind, and wet's the raine,
               Saint Hugh be our good spéede:
               Ill is the weather that bringeth no gaine,
               Nor helpes good hearts in neede.
            
         
         
            
            The Prologue as it was pronounced before the Queenes Maiestie.
            AS wretrhes in a storme (expecting day)
            With trembling hands and eyes cast vp to heauen,
            Make Prayers the anchor of their conquerd hopes,
            So we (deere Goddesse) wonder of all eyes,
            Your meanest bassalls (through mistrust and feare,
            To uncke into the bottome of disgrace,
            By our impersit pastimes) prostrate thus
            On bended knees, our sailes of hope do strike,
            Dreading the bitter stormes of your dislike.
            Since then (vnhappy men) our hap is such,
            That to our selues our selues no help can bring,
            But néedes must perish, if your saint-like cares
            (Locking the temple where all mercy sits)
            Refuse the tribute of our begging tongues.
            Oh graunt (bright mirror of true Chastitie)
            From those life-breathing starres your sun-like eyes,
            One gratious smile: for your celestiall breath
            Must send vs life, or sentence vs to death.
         
         
            
            A pleasant Comedie of the Gentle Craft.
            Enter Lord Maior, Lincolne.
            
               Lincolne.
               
                  MY Lord Maior, you haue sundrie times
               Feasted my selfe, and many Courtiers more,
               Seldome, or neuer can we be so kind,
               To make requitall of your curtesie:
               But leauing this, I heare my cosen Lacie
               Is much affected to your daughter Rose.
            
            
               L. Maior.
               True my good Lord, and she loues him so wel, That I mislike her boldnesse in the chace.
            
            
               Lincol.
               Why my lord Maior, think you it then a shame, To ioyne a Lacie with an Otleys name?
            
            
               L. Maior.
               Too meane is my poore girle for his high birth,
               Poore Cittizens must not with Courtiers wed,
               Who will in silkes, and gay apparrell spend
               More in one yeare, then I am worth by farre,
               Therefore your honour néede not doubt my girle.
            
            
               Lincolne.
               Take héede my Lord, aduise you what you do,
               A berier vnthrist liues not in the world,
               Then is my cosen, for Ile tel you what,
               
                  Tis now almost a yeare since he requested
               To trauell countries for experience,
               I furnisht him with coyne, billes of exchange,
               Letters of credite, men to waite on him,
               Solicited my friends in Italie
               Well to respect him: but to sée the end:
               Scant had he iornied through halfe Germanie,
               But all his coyne was spent, his men cast off,
               His billes imbezeld, and my iolly coze,
               Asham'd to shew his bankerupt presence here,
               Became a Shoomaker in Wittenberg,
               A goodly science for a gentleman
               Of such discent: now iudge the rest by this.
               Suppose your daughter haue a thousand pound,
               He did consume me more in one halfe yeare,
               And make him heyre to all the wealth you haue,
               One twelue moneth's rioting wil waste it all,
               Then seeke (my Lord) some honest Cittizen
               To wed your daughter to.
            
            
               L. Maior.
               I thanke your Lordship,
               Wel Fore, I understand your subtiltie,
               As for your nephew, let your lordships eie
               But watch his actions, and you néede not feare,
               For I haue my daughter farre enough,
               And yet your cosen Rowland might do well
               Now he hath learn'd an occupation,
               And yet I scorne to call him sonne in law.
            
            
               Lincolne.
               I but I haue a better trade for him,
               I thanke his grace he hath appointed him,
               Chiefe colonell of all those companies
               Mustred in London, and the shires about,
               To serue his highnesse in those warres of France:
               Sée where he comes: Louel what newes with you?
            
            
               
               Enter Louell, Lacie, and Askew.
            
            
               Louell.
               My Lord of Lincolne, tis his highnesse will,
               That presently your cosen ship for France
               With all his powers, he would not for a million,
               But they should land at Déepe within foure daies.
            
            
               Linc.
               Goe certifie his grace it shall be done:
Exit Louell.
               
               Now cosen Lacie, in what forwardnesse
               Are all your companies?

               All gallantly prepar'd in Finsbury,
               With frolike spirits, long for their parting hower.

               They haue their imprest, coates, and furniture,
               And if it please your cosen Lacie come

               And twentie pounds besides my brethren
               Will fréely giue him, to approue our loues

               Lincolne.

               Nephew: that twentie pound he doth bestow,
               For ioy to rid you from his daughter Rose:
               But cosens both, now here are none but friends,
               I would not haue you cast an amorous eie
               Upon so meane a proiect, as the loue
               Of a gay wanton painted cittizen,
               I know this churle, even in the height of scorne,
               Doth hate the mixture of his bloud with thine,
               I pray thée do thou so, remember coze,
               
                  What honourable fortunes wayt on thée,

               And gilds thy hopes, I haue no heire but thée:
               And yet not thée, if with a wayward spirit,
               Thou start from the true byas of my loue.
            
            
               Lacie.
               My Lord, I will (for honor (not desire
               Of land or liuings) or to be your heire)
               So guide my actions in pursuit of France,
               As shall adde glorie to the Lacies name.
            
            
               Lincolne.

               Truly my friends, it lies not in my power,
               The Londoners are prest, paide, and set forth
               By the Lord Maior, I cannot change a man.
            
            
               Hodge.
               Why then you were as good be a corporall, as a colonel, if you cannot discharge one good fellow, and I tell you true, I thinke you doe more then you can answere, to presie a man within a yeare and a day of his mariage.
            
            
               Eyre.
               Wel said melancholy Hodge, gramercy my fine foreman.
            
            
               Wife.
               Truly gentlemen, it were il done, for such as you, to stand so stiffely against a poore yong wife: considering her case, she is new married, but let that passe: I pray deale not roughly with her, her husband is a yong man and but newly entred, but let that passe.
            
            
               Eyre.
               Away with your pisherie pasherie, your pols and your edipolls, peace Midaffe, silence Cisly Bumtrincket, let your head speake.

               Eyre.
               Too soone, my fine Firk, too soone: peace scoundrels, see you this man? Captaines, you will not release him, wel let him go, hée's a proper shot, let him vanish, peace Iane, drie vp thy teares, theile make his powder darkish, take him braue men, Hector of Troy was an hackney to him, Hercules and Termagant scoundrelles, Prince Arthurs Round table, by the Lord of Lutgate, nere fed such a tall, such a dapper swordman: by the life of Pharo, a braue resolute swordman, peace Iane, I say no more, mad knaues.

               Giue me thy hand,
               Thou shalt not want, as I am a gentleman:
               Woman, be patient, God (no doubt) wil send
               Thy husband safe againe, but he must go,
               His countries quarrel sayes, it shall be so.

               O yes, out of cry, by my troth, I scant knew him, here a wore scarffe, and here a scarfe, here a bunch of fethers,

and here pretious stones and iewells, and a paire of garters: O monstrous like one of our yellow silke curtains, at home here in Old-ford house, here in maister Bellymounts chamber, I stoode at our doore in Cornehill, lookt at him, he at me indeed, spake to him, but he not to me, not a word, mary guy thought I with a wanion, he passt by me as prowde, mary foh, are you growne humorous thought I? and so shut the doore, and in I came.

               No doue was euer halfe so milde as he.
            
            
               Sibil
               Milde? yea, as a bushel of stampt crabs, he lookt vpon me as sowre as veriuice: goe thy wayes thought I, thou maist be much in my gaskins, but nothing in my neatherstockes: this is your fault mistris, to loue him that loues not you, he thinkes scorne to do as he's done to, but if I were as you, Ide cry, go by Ieronimo, go by, Ide set mine olde debts against my new driblets, and the hares foot against the goose giblets, for if euer I sigh when sléepe I shoulde take, pray God I may loose my mayden-head when I wake.
            
            
               Rose
               Will my loue leaue me then and go to France?
            
            
               Sibill
               I knowe not that, but I am sure I see him stalke before the souldiers, by my troth he is a propper man, but he is proper that proper doth, let him goe snicke-vp yong mistris.
            
            
               Rose
               Get thée to London, and learne perfectly,
               Whether my Lacy go to France, or no:
               Do this, and I wil giue thée for thy paines,
               My cambricke apron, and my romish gloues,
               My purple stockings, and a stomacher,
               Say, wilt thou do this Sibil for my sake?
            
            
               Sibil
               Wil I quoth a? at whose suite? by my troth yes, Ile go, a cambricke apron, gloues, a paire of purple stockings,

and a stomacher, Ile sweat in purple mistris for you, ile take any thing that comes a Gods name, O rich, a Cambricke apron; faith then haue at vp tailes all, Ile go, Iiggy, Ieggy to London, and be here in a trice yong mistris.

               How many shapes haue gods and kings deuisde,
               Thereby to compasse their desired loues?
               It is no shame for Rowland Lacy then,
               To clothe his cunning with the Gentle Craft,
               That thus disguisde, I may vnknowne possesse,
               The onely happie presence of my Rose:
               For her haue I forsooke my charge in France,
               Incurd the Kings displeasure, and stir'd vp
               Rough hatred in mine vncle Lincolnes brest:
               O loue, how powerfull art thou, that canst change
               High birth to barenesse, and a noble mind,
               To the meane semblance of a shooemaker?
               But thus it must be: for her cruell father,
               Hating the single vnion of our soules,
               Hath secretly conueyd my Rose from London,
               To barre me of her presence, but I trust
               Fortune and this disguise will furder me
               Once more to view her beautie, gaine her sight.
               Here in Towerstréete, with Ayre the shooe-maker,
               Meane I a while to worke, I know the trade,
               I learn't it when I was in Wittenberge:
               Then cheere thy hoping sprites, be not dismaide,
               Thou canst not want, do fortune what she can,
               The Gentle Craft is liuing for a man.

               Hod
               The truth is Firk, that the marchant owner of the ship dares not shew his head, and therefore this skipper that deales for him, for the loue he beares to Hans, offers my master Eyre a bargaine in the commodities, he shal haue a reasonable day of payment, he may sel the wares by that time, and be an huge gainer himselfe.
            
            
               Firk.
               Yea, but can my fellow Hans lend my master twentie porpentines as an earnest pennie.

               Dodger.
               My Lord, vpon the eightéene day of May,
               The French and English were preparde to fight,
               Each side with eager furie gaue the signe
               Of a most hot encounter, fiue long howres
               Both armies fought together: at the length,
               The lot of victorie fel on our sides,
               Twelue thousand of the Frenchmen that day dide,
               Foure thousand English, and no man of name,
               But Captaine Hyam, and yong Ardington,
               
                  Two gallant Gentlemen, I knew them well.
            
            
               Lin.
               But Dodger, prethée tell me in this fight,
               How did my cozen Lacie beare himselfe?
            
            
               Dodger.
               My Lord, your cosen Lacie was not there.
            
            
               Linc.
               Not there? Dog. No, my good Lord.
            
            
               Lin.
               Sure thou mistakest,
               I saw him shipt, and a thousand eies beside
               Were witnesses of the farewels which he gaue,
               When I with wéeping eies bid him adew:
               Dodger take héede.
            
            
               Dodger.
               My Lord I am aduis'd,
               That what I spake is true: to proue it so,
               His cosen Askew that supplide his place,
               Sent me for him from France, that secretly
               He might conuey himselfe hither.
            
            
               Lin.
               Ist euen so.
               Dares he so carelessely venture his life,
               Upon the indignation of a King?
               Hath he despis'd my loue, and spurn'd those fauours,
               Which I with prodigall hand powr'd on his head?
               He shall repent his rashnes with his soule,
               Since of my loue he makes no estimate,
               Ile make him wish he had not knowne my hate,
               Thou hast no other newes?
            
            
               Dodger.
               None else, my Lord.
            
            
               Lin.
               None worse I know thou hast: procure the king
               To crowne his giddie browes with ample honors,
               Send him chéefe Colonell, and all my hope
               Thus to be dasht? but tis in vaine to grieue,
               One euill cannot a worse releeue:
               Upon my life I haue found out his plot,
               That old dog Loue that fawnd vpon him so,
               Loue to that puling girle, his faire cheek't Rose,
               
                  The Lord Maiors daughter hath distracted him,
               And in the fire of that loues lunacie,
               Hath he burnt vp himselfe, comsum'd his credite,
               Lost the kings loue, yea and I feare, his life,
               Onely to get a wanton to his wife:
               Dodger, it is so.
            
            
               Dodger.
               I feare so, my good Lord.
            
            
               Lincolne.
               It is so, nay sure it cannot be,
               I am at my wits end Dodger.
            
            
               Dodger.
               Yea my Lord.
            
            
               Lin.
               Thou art acquainted with my Nephewes haunts,
               Spend this gold for thy paines, goe seeke him out,
               Watch at my Lord Maiors (there if he liue)
               Dodger, thou shalt be sure to méete with him:
               Prethée be diligent. Lacie thy name
               Liu'd once in honour, now dead in shame:
               Be circumspect.

               Since my departure.
            
            
               Wife.
               Yea truly Rafe, I thanke my maker: but let that passe.
            
            
               Rog.
               And sirra Rafe, what newes, what newes in France?
            
            
               Rafe.
               Tel mee good Roger first, what newes in England?
               Haw does my Iane? when didst thou sée my wife?
               Where liues my poore heart? shéel be poore indéed
               Now I want limbs to get whereon to féed.
            
            
               Roger.
               Limbs? hast thou not hands man? thou shalt neuer sée a shoomaker want bread, though he haue but thrée fingers on a hand.
            
            
               Rafe.
               Yet all this while I heare not of my Iane.
            
            
               Wife.
               O Rafe your wife, perdie we knowe not whats become of her: she was here a while, and because she was married grewe more stately then became her, I checkt her, and so forth, away she flung, neuer returned, nor saide bih

nor bah: and Rafe you knowe ka me, ka thée. And so as I tell ye. Roger is not Firke come yet?
            
            
               Roger.
               No forsooth.
            
            
               Wife.
               And so indeed we heard not of her, but I heare shée liues in London: but let that passe. If she had wanted, shee might haue opened her case to me or my husband, or to any of my men, I am sure theres not any of them perdie, but would haue done her good to his power. Hans looke if Firke be come.
            
            Exit Hans.
            
               Hans.
               Yaw it sal vro.
            
            
               Wife.
               And so as I saide: but Rafe, why dost thou wéepe? thou knowest that naked wee came out of our mothers wombe, and naked we must returne, and therefore thanke God for al things.
            
            
               Roger.
               No faith Iane is a straunger héere, but Rafe pull vp a good heart, I knowe thou hast one, thy wife man, is in London, one tolde mée hée sawe her a while agoe verie braue and neate, wéele ferret her out, and London holde her.
            
            
               Wife.
               Alas, poore soule, hées ouercome with sorrowe, he does but as I doe, weepe for the losse of any good thing: but Rafe, get thee in, call for some meate and drinke, thou shalt find me worshipful towards thée.
            
            
               Rafe.
               I thanke you dame, siuce I want lims and lands,
               Ile to God, my good friends, and to these my hands.

               Ha, ha, ha, I had rather then a thousand pound,

               Whom gladly I would call sonne in law:
               But my fine cockney would haue none of him.
               You'le proue a cockscombe for it ere you die,

               Ham.
               Tis so.
            
            
               Iane.
               What remedie?
            
            
               Ham.
               Nay faith you are too coy.

               I would let goe this beautie, were I not
               In mind to disobey you by a power
               That controlles kings: I loue you.
            
            
               Iane.
               So, now part.
            
            
               Ham.
               With hands I may, but neuer with my heart,
               In faith I loue you.
            
            
               Iane.

               Ham.
               Shall a true loue in me bréede hate in you?
            
            
               Iane.
               I hate you not.
            
            
               Ham.

               Ham.
               All this I hope is but a womans fray,
               That means, come to me, when she cries, away:
               In earnest mistris I do not iest,
               A true chaste loue hath entred in my brest,
               In loue you dearely as I loue my life,
               I loue you as a husband loues a wife.
               That, and no other loue my loue requires,
               Thy wealth I know is little, my desires
               Thirst not for gold, swéete beauteous Iane whats mine,
               Shall (if thou make my selfe thine) all be thine,
               Say, iudge, what is thy sentence, life or death?
               Mercie or crueltie lies in thy breath.
            
            
               Iane.
               Good sir, I do beleeue you loue me well:
               For tis a séely conquest, séely pride,
               For one like you (I meane a gentleman)
               To boast, that by his loue tricks he hath brought,
               Such and such women to his amorous lure:
               
                  I thinke you do not so, yet many doe,
               And make it euen a very trade to wooe,
               I could be coy, as many women be,
               Féede you with sunne-shine smiles, and wanton lookes,
               But I detest witchcraft, say that I
               Doe coustantly beleeue you, constant haue.
            
            
               Ham.
               Why dost thou not beléeue me?
            
            
               Iane.
               I beleeue you,
               But yet good sir, because I will not gréeue you,
               With hopes to taste fruite, which will neuer fall,
               In simple truth this is the summe of all
               My husband liues, at least I hope he liues,
               Prest was he to these bitter warres in France,
               Bitter they are to me by wanting him,
               I haue but one heart, and that hearts his due,
               How can I then bestow the same on you?
               Whilst he liues, his I liue, be it nere so poore,
               And rather be his wife, then a kings whore.
            
            
               Ham.
               Chaste and deare woman, I will not abuse thée,
               Although it cost my life, if thou refuse me,
               Thy husband prest for France, what was his name?
            
            
               Iane.
               Rafe Damport.
            
            
               Ham.
               Damport, heres a letter sent
               From France to me, from a deare friend of mine,
               A gentleman of place, here he doth write,
               Their names that haue bin slaine in euery fight.
            
            
               Iane.
               I hope deaths scroll containes not my loues name
            
            
               Ham.
               Cannot you reade?
            
            
               Iane.
               I can.
            
            
               Ham.
               Beruse the same,
               To my remembrance such a name I read
               Amongst the rest: sée here.
            
            
               Iane.
               Aye me, hées dead:
               
                  Hées dead, if this be true my deare hearts slaine.
            
            
               Ham.
               Haue patience, deare loue.
            
            
               Iane.
               Hence, hence.
            
            
               Ham.
               Nay swéete Iane,
               Make not poore sorrow prowd with these rich teares,
               I mourne thy husbands death because thou mournst.
            
            
               Iane.
               That bil is forgde; tis signde by forgerie.
            
            
               Ham.
               Ile bring thée letters sent besides to many
               Carrying the like report: Iane tis too true,
               Come, wéepe not: mourning though it rise from loue
               Helpes not the mourned, yet hurtes them that mourne.
            
            
               Iane.
               For Gods sake leaue me.
            
            
               Ham.
               Whither dost thou turne?
               Forget the déede, loue them that are aliue,
               His loue is faded, trie how mine will thriue.
            
            
               Iane.
               Tis now no time for me to thinke on loue,
            
            
               Ham.
               Tis now best time for you to thinke on loue, because your loue liues not.
            
            
               Iane.
               Thogh he be dead, my loue to him shal not be buried:
               For Gods sake leaue me to my selfe alone.
            
            
               Ham.
               I would kil my soule to leaue thée drownd in mone:
               Answere me to my sute, and I am gone,
               Say to me, yea, or no.
            
            
               Iane.
               No.
            
            
               Ham.
               Then farewell, one farewel wil not serue, I come again, come drie these wet chéekes, tel me faith sweete Iane, yea, or no, once more.
            
            
               Iane.
               Once more I say no, once more be gone I pray, else wil I goe.
            
            
               Ham.
               Nay then I wil grow rude by this white hand,
               Until you change that colde no, here ile stand,
               Til by your hard heart
            
            
               Iane.
               Nay, for Gods loue peace,
               
                  My sorrowes by your presence more increase,
               Not that you thus are present, but al griefe
               Desires to be alone, therefore in briefe
               Thus much I say, and saying bid adew,
               If euer I wed man it shall be you.
            
            
               Ham.
               Oh blessed voyce, deare Iane Ile vrge no more,
               Thy breath hath made me rich.
            
            
               Iane.
               Death makes me poore.

               Why you must make them in all parts like this shoe, but at any hand faile not to do them, for the Gentlewoman is to be married very early in the morning.

               At this strange accident? vpon my life,
               This was the verie shoe I gaue my wife
               When I was prest for France, since when alas,
               I neuer could heare of her: it is the same,

               Why then I do, this shooe I durst be sworne

               Thus Firke, euen now here came a seruingman,
               By this shooe would he haue a new paire made
               Against to morrow morning for his mistris,

               Since first your nephew Lacie went to France,
               I haue not seene him. It séemd strange to me,
               When Dodger told me that he staide behinde,
               
                  Neglecting the hie charge the King imposed.

               Your counsell had giuen head to this attempt,
               Drawne to it by the loue he beares your child.
               Here I did hope to find him in your house,
               But now I sée mine error, and confesse
               My iudgement wrongd you by conceuing so.

               I loue your Nephew Lacie too too dearely
               So much to wrong his honor, and he hath done so,
               That first gaue him aduise to stay from France.
               To witnesse I speake truth, I let you know
               How carefull I haue beene to kéepe my daughter
               Frée from all conference, or spéech of him,
               Not that I skorne your Nephew, but in loue
               I beare your honour, least your noble bloud,
               Should by my meane worth be dishonoured.

               How far the churles tongue wanders from his hart,
               Well, well sir Roger Otley I beléeue you,
               With more then many thankes for the kind loue,
               So much you séeme to beare me: but my Lord,
               Let me request your helpe to séeke my Nephew,
               Whom if I find, Ile straight embarke for France,
               So shal my Rose be frée, your thoughts at rest,
               And much care die which now dies in my brest.
               Enter Sibill.

               King
               Is our lord Maior of London such a gallant?
            
            
               Noble man
               One of the merriest madcaps in your land,
               Your Grace wil thinke, when you behold the man,
               Hées rather a wilde ruffin than a Maior:
               Yet thus much Ile ensure your maiestie,
               In al his actions that concerne his state,
               He is as serious, prouident, and wise,
               As full of grauitie amongst the graue,
               As any maior hath beene these many yeares.
            
            
               King
               I am with child til I behold this halfe cap,
               But all my doubt is, when we come in presence,
               His madnesse will be dasht cleane out of countenance.
            
            
               Noble man
               It may be so, my Liege.
            
            
               King
               Which to preuent,
               Let some one giue him notice, tis our pleasure,
               That he put on his woonted merriment:
               Set forward.

               Come my fine Hodge, my iolly gentlemen shooemakers, soft, where be these Caniballes, these varlets my officers, let them al walke and waite vpon my brethren, for my meaning is, that none but shoomakers, none but the liuery

               No more Firke, come liuely, let your fellowe prentises want no cheere, let wine be plentiful as béere, and beere as water, hang these penny pinching fathers, that cramme wealth in innocent lamb skinnes, rip knaues, anaunt, looke to my guests

               My Lord, we are at our wits end for roome, those hundred tables wil not feast the fourth part of them.
            
            
               Ayre

               Firke
               Tickle it? some of them haue taken their licour standing so long, that they can stand no longer: but for meate, they would eate it and they had it.
            
            
               Ayre
               Want they meate? wheres this swag-belly, this greasie kitchinstuffe cooke, call the varlet to me: want meat! Firke, Hodge, lame Rafe, runne my tall men, beleager the shambles, beggar al East-Cheape, serue me whole oxen in chargers, and let sheepe whine vpon the tables like pigges for want of good felowes to eate them. Want meate! vanish Firke, auaunt Hodge.
            
            
               Hodge
               Your lordship mistakes my man Firke, he means their bellies want meate, not the boords, for they haue drunk so much they can eate nothing.

               This my deere liege: your grace to doe me honour,
               Heapt on the head of this degenerous boy,
               Desertlesse fauours, you made choise of him,
               To be commander ouer powers in France,
               But he.

               Ranne himselfe déepely (in the highest degrée)
               Into vile treason.
            
            
               Linc.
               Is he not a traytor?
            
            
               King
               Lincolne, he was: now haue we pardned him,
               Twas not a base want of true valors fire,
               That held him out of France, but loues desire.
            
            
               Linc.
               I wil not beare his shame vpon my backe.
            
            
               King
               Nor shalt thou Lincolne, I forgive you both.
            
            
               
               Lin
               Then (good my liege) forbid the boy to wed
               One, whose meane birth will much disgrace his bed.
            
            
               King
               Are they not married?
            
            
               Linc.
               No my Liege.
            
            
               Both
               We are.
            
            
               King
               Shall I divorce them then? O be it farre,
               That any hand on earth should dare vntie,
               The sacred knot knit by Gods maiestie,
               I would not for my crowne disioyne their hands,
               That are conioynd in holy nuptiall bands,
               How saist thou Lacy? wouldst thou loose thy Rose?
            
            
               Hans
               Not for all Indians wealth, my soueraigne.
            
            
               King
               But Rose I am sure her Lacie would forgoe.
            
            
               Rose
               If Rose were askt that question, sheed say, no.
            
            
               King
               You heare them Lincolne.
            
            
               Linc
               Yea my liege, I do.
            
            
               King
               Yet canst thou find ith heart to part these two?
               Who séeks, besides you, to diuorce these louers?
            
            
               L. Ma.
               I do (my gracious Lord) I am her father.
            
            
               King
               Sir Roger Oteley, our last Maior I thinke,
            
            
               Nob
               The same my liege.
            
            
               King
               Would you offend Loues lawes?
               Wel, you shal haue your wills, you sue to me,
               To prohibite the match: Soft, let me sée,
               You both are married, Lacie, art thou not?
            
            
               Hans
               I am, dread Soueraigne.
            
            
               King
               Then vpon thy life,
               I charge thée, not to call this woman wife.
            
            
               L. Ma.
               I thanke your grace.

               O my most gratious Lord!
               kneele
            
            
               King
               Nay Rose, neuer wooe me, I tel you true,
               Although as yet I am a batchellor,
               Yet I beléèue I shal not marry you.
            
            
               
               Rose
               Can you diuide the body from the soule,
               Yet make the body liue?
            
            
               King
               Yea, so profound?
               I cannot Rose, but you I must diuide:
               Faire maide, this bridegroome cannot be your bride.
               Are you pleasde Lincolne? Oteley, are you pleasde?
            
            
               Both
               Yes my Lord.
            
            
               King
               Then must my heart be easde,
               For credit me, my conscience liues in paine,
               Til these whom I deuorcde be ioyned againe:
               Lacy, giue me thy hand, Rose, lend me thine.
               Be what you would be: kisse now: so, thats fine,
               At night (louers) to bed: now let me sée,
               Which of you all mislikes this harmony?
            
            
               L. Ma.
               Wil you then take from me my child perforce?
            
            
               King
               Why tell me Oteley, shines not Lacies name,
               As bright in the worldes eye, as the gay beames
               Of any citizen?
            
            
               Linc.
               Yea but my gratious Lord,
               I do mislike the match farre more than he,
               Her bloud is too too base.
            
            
               King Lincolne,
               no more,
               Dost thou not know, that loue respects no bloud?
               Cares not for difference of birth, or state,
               The maide is yong, wel borne, faire, vertuous,
               A worthy bride for any gentleman:
               Besides, your nephew for her sake did stoope
               To bare necessitie: and as I heare,
               Forgetting honors, and all courtly pleasures,
               To gaine her loue, became a shooemaker.
               As for the honor which he lost in France,
               Thus I redéeme it: Lacie, knéele thée downe,
               Arise sir Rowland Lacie: tell me now,
               
                  Tell me in earnest Oteley, canst thou chide?
               Séeing thy Rose a ladie and a bryde.
            
            
               Lord Maior.
               I am content with what your Grace hath done.
            
            
               Linc.
               And I my liege, since theres no remedie.
            
            
               King
               Come on then, at shake hands, Ile haue you frends,
               Where there is much loue, all discord ends,
               What sayes my mad Lord Maior to all this loue?
            
            
               Eyre
               O my liege, this honour you haue done to my fine iourneyman here, Rowland Lacie, and all these fauours which you have showne to me this daye in my poore house, will make Simon Eyre liue longer by one dozen of warme summers more then he should.
            
            
               King
               Nay, my mad Lord Maior (that shall be thy name)
               If any grace of mine can length thy life,
               One honour more Ile doe thee, that new building,
               Which at thy cost in Cornehill is erected,
               Shall take a name from vs, wéele haue it cald,
               The Leaden hall, because in digging it,
               You found the lead that couereth the same.
            
            
               Eyre
               I thanke your Maiestie.
            
            
               Wife
               God blesse your Grace.
            
            
               King
               Lincolne, a word with you.
            
            Enter Hodge, Firke, Rafe, and more shoomakers.
            
               Eyre
               How now my mad knaues? Peace, speake softly, yonder is the king.
            
            
               King
               With the olde troupe which there we kéepe in pay,
               We wil incorporate a new supply:
               Before one summer more passe ore my head,
               France shal repent England was iniured.
               What are all those?
            
            
               Hans
               All shoomakers, my Liege,
               
                  Sometimes my fellowes, in their companies
               I siude as merry as an empror.
            
            
               King
               My mad lord Mayor, are all these shoomakers?
            
            
               Eyre
               All Shooemakers, my Liege, all gentlemen of the Gentle Craft, true Troians, couragious Cordwainers, they all knéele to the shrine of holy saint Hugh.
            
            
               All
               God saue your maiesty all shoomakers
            
            
               King
               Mad Simon, would they any thing with vs?
            
            
               Eyre
               Mum mad knaues, not a word, Ile doot, I warrant you. They are all beggars, my Liege, all for themselues: and I for them all, on both my knées do intreate, that for the honor of poore Simon Eyre, and the good of his brethren these mad knaues, your Grace would vouchsafe some priuilege to my new Leden hall, that it may be lawfull for vs to buy and sell leather there two dayes a wéeke.
            
            
               King
               Mad Sim, I grant your suite, you shall haue patent
               To hold two market dayes in Leden hall,
               Mondayes and Fridayes, those shal be the times:
               Will this content you?
            
            
               All
               Iesus blesse your Grace.
            
            
               Eyre
               In the name of these my poore brethren shoomakers, I most humbly thanke your Grace. But before I rise, séeing you are in the Giuing vaine, and we in the Begging, graunt Sim Eyre one boone more.
            
            
               King
               What is it my Lord Maior?
            
            
               Eyre
               Vouchsafe to taste of a poore banquet that standes swéetely waiting for your sweete presence.

               I shall vndo thee Eyre, only with feasts,
               Already haue I béene too troublesome,
               Say, haue I not?
            
            
               Eyre
               O my deere king, Sim Eyre was taken vnawares vpon a day of shrouing which I promist long ago to the pren tises of London: for andt please your Highnes, in time past

                     〈◊〉
                   my backe:
               And then vpon a morning some mad boyes,
               It was Shrouetuesday éeune as tis now,
