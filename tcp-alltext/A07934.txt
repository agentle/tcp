ancient Architecture,
requiring to their excellēce
a like creating and proportionable
Rapture, and being

alike ouer-topt by the
monstrous Babels of our
Moderne Barbarisme;
Their vniust obscurity, letting
no glance of their trueth
and dignity appear, but
to passing few: To passing
few is their lest apparance
to be presented. Your selfe
then being a Chiefe of that

few, by whom Both are apprehended;
& their beames
worthily measur'd and valew'd.
This little Light of
the one, I could not but obiect,
and publish to your
choise apprehension; especially
for your most ingenuous
Loue to all Workes, in which
the ancient Greeke Soules

haue appear'd to you. No

And therefore, howsoeuer

            To the Commune
Reader.
            WHen you see Leander
and Hero,
the Subiects of this Pamphlet;

I perswade my self,
your preiudice will encrease
to the contempt of
it; eyther headlong presupposing
it, all one; or at
no part matcheable, with
that partly excellent Poem,

of Maister Marloes.
For your all one; the
VVorkes are in nothing
alike; a different Character
being held through,
both the Stile, Matter, &
inuention. For the match

of it; let but your eyes be
Matches, and it will in
many parts ouermatch it.
In the Originall, it being
by all the most Learned,
the incomparable Loue-Poem
of the world. And

I would be somthing sorry,
you could iustly taxe
me, with dooing it any
wrong in our English;
though perhappes it will
not so amble vnder your
seasures and censures, as

the before publish't.
            Let the great Comprehenders,
and vnable
Vtterers of the Greeke
elocution in other Language;
drop vnder theyr
vnlodings, how humbly

soeuer they please; and
the rather disclaime their
owne strength, that my
weaknesse may seeme the
more presumptnous: It
can impose no scruple
the more burthen on my

shoulders, that I wil feele;
vnlesse Reason chance to
ioyne Arbiter with Will,
and appeare to mee: To
whome I am euer prostrately
subiect. And if
enuious Misconstruction

could once leaue tyrannizing
ouer my infortunate
Innocence; Both
the Charity it argu'de,
would render them that
vse it, the more Christian;
and mee industrious,

to hale out of them the
discharge of their owne
Duties.

two ancient Towns: One,

in Europe, another in Asia;
