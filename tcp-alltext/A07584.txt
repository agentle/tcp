               FRendes this daye is called the fyrſt ſondaye in aduent / wherfore holy chirche maketh mencyon of ye comynge of cryſt goddes ſone in to this worlde to bye mā
               kynde out of the deuylles bondage and to brynge all well doers in to the blyſſe that euer ſhall laſt and alſo of his other comynge that ſhall be atte the daye of dome / whan he ſhall come to deme all wycked doers in to the payne of helle for euer. ¶But the fyrſt comynge of Cryſte in to this worlde brought Ioye & blyſſe with hym / therfore holy chirche vſed ſonges of myrth as (alleluya) and other. ¶And for the ſeconde comynge of Cryſte ſhall be ſo cruell yt no tonge may telle. Therfore holy chirche lyeth doune ſonges of melodye as Te deum lauda. Gloria in excelſis and weddynge / for after that daye ſhall neuer be weddynge more in tokenynge vengeaunce that cometh after. Than after the fyrſt comynge of Cryſt in to this worlde ſaynt Auſten ſayth there ben thre thynges ryfe in this worlde / that is byrthe / trauaylle / and deth. This is the teſtament that Adam oure forme fader made to all his ofſprynge after hym that is to be borne in ſykenes / and for to lyue in traueyle / & for to deye in drede. But Cryſte he came to be our ſocour of this teſtamente. And was borne and traueylled and deyed. He was borne to brynge men of out of ſykeneſſe in to euerlaſtynge hele. He traueyled to brynge man to euerlaſtynge reſte. He deyed to brynge man to euerlaſtynge lyfe. ¶This was the cauſe of the fyrſt comynge of cryſte in to this worlde / wherfore he yt wyll ſcape the dome that he ſhall come too in the ſeconde comynge he muſte leye doune all maner of pryde of herte / and knowe hym ſelfe a wretche of erthe and holde mekenes in his herte / he muſt traueyle his body in good werkes / and gete truely his leuelode with traueyle of his body / & put of

hym a waye all ydleneſſe. For he that wyll not trauayle his body in good werkes as ſaynt Bernarde ſayeth / he ſhall trauayle euer with fendes in helle. And for drede of deth he muſt make hym euer redy to god / whan he wyll ſende for hym / that is to ſay ſhryue hym clene of all his ſynnes / and not abyde fro yere to yere / but as ſone as he fayleth anone ryſe vp and mekely take downe his ſhryfte fader / thenne ſhall he at that day of dome haue grete worſhyp / for ryght as a knyght ſhewed his woundes that he hath in batell in moche commendynge to hym. Ryght ſoo the ſynnes that a man hath done and is ſhryuen of and dooth his penaunce ſhall be moche worſhyp to hym / and grete confuſyon to the fende. And that he is not ſhryuen of ſhall be ſhewed openly to all the worlde in grete ſhame to hym. This is ſayd for ye fyrſt comynge of Cryſt in to this worlde (Dominus veniet ad iudicium) ¶The ſeconde comynge of Cryſt is to the dome (Tūc videbūt filiū hominis venientem in nubibus cum poteſtate magna et mageſtate) ¶And theſe comynges ſhal be ſo cruell / that .xv. dayes afore ſhall come tokenes of grete drede ſo that there by the people may knowe that ſone after cometh the dome (Secundum Iheronimum) as ſaynt Iherom ſayth. ¶The fyrſte daye the water ſhall ryſe vpō the ſee and it ſhall be hygher than ony hylle by .xl. cubytes. ¶The ſeconde daye the ſee ſhall falle doune ſoo lowe that vnneth it may be ſeen. ¶The thyrde daye all the fyſſhe & beeſtes in the ſee ſhall make ſuche a crye and rorynge that no tonge may telle / but god hym ſelfe. ¶The fourth daye the ſee and waters ſhall brenne. ¶The fyfte daye all trees and herbes ſhall ſwete blode / and all maner of foules ſhall come togyder / and nother ete ne drynke for drede of dome that is comynge. ¶The ſyxte daye all grete buldynges caſtels tours ſteples and houſes ſhall falle doune and brenne tylle the ſonne ryſe agayne. ¶The .vii. daye all ſtones and

rockes ſhall bete togyder that eche eche of them ſhall breke other with an horryble noyſe / that whiche ſhall be herde in to heuen. ¶The .viii. daye the erthe ſhall quake / ſoo that there may may no man ſtande theron / but ſhall fall doune ¶The .ix. daye the people ſhall goo oute of theyr dennes / and goo as they were myndeles and none ſpeke to other. ¶The .x. daye the hylles and the erthe ſhall be euen and playne. ¶The .xi. daye all graues and tombes ſhall be opened and the bodyes ſhall ſtande vpon theym. ¶The .xii. daye ſterres ſhall falle fro heuen ſhetynge out brennynge bemes a dredefull ſyghte to ſee. ¶The .xiii. daye they ſhall deye that beren lyfe. ¶The fourteyne daye heuen and erthe ſhall brenne. ¶The ſyxteyne daye heuen and erthe ſhall be made newe and all people ſhall ryſe in the aege of thyrty wynter and come to the dome (Dominus veniet ad iudicium cum multitudinie angelorum) Thenne ſhall come to the dome oure blyſſed lorde Iheſu Cryſte veray god and man with his aungelles / and ſhewe his woundes freſſhe bledynge / as that daye he deyed on the croſſe with all the Inſtrumentes of his paſſyon. The ſpere crowne / ſcourges nayles / hamer / pynſons / and the garlonde of thornes / to ſhewe what he ſuffred in his paſſyon for mankynde. Then may they be ſory and ferde that haue ſworne by his paſſyon or his woundes / or by ony membre of his body / that ſhal be a grete repreef to theym but they amende theym in this worlde or that they deye. Thenne wyll oure lorde Iheſus Cryſte gretely thanke theym that haue done mercy in this worlde for his ſake to theyr euen cryſten / and wyll ſaye thus to theym (Venite benedicti patris mei percipite regnum. &c) ¶Come ye my faders blyſſed chyldern and receyue ye the kyngedome of heuen yt is ordeyned to you / and ſoo reherſe vnto them the ſeuen werkes of mercy other wyſe called the operacyons of myſerycorde done to the nedefull / ❀

Whan I was houngry ye gaue to me mete (Sitiui et dediſtis miche bibere) Whan I was thyrſty ye gaue me drynke and whan I was herberles ye herbered me / and ſoo forth all ye werkes of mercy. For whan ye gaue ony thynge in my name / it was to me. Thenne ſhall our lorde rebuke the ryche people / that wolde not do for his loue / nor to forgyue no treſpace for his ſake. And ſayd to them (Diſcedite a me maledicti in ignem eternum) Goo ye curſed people into euerlaſtynge payne of helle. For whan I was a houngred ye gaue me no mete. &c. Than may they be full ſory and wo that euer our lorde Iheſu cryſt ſhall thus rebuke them. For there ſhall be no man of lawe to plete nor for golde nor for ſyluer nor other gyftes to helpe. For thenne ſhall nother mayſter ne lordeſhyp helpe but all be ſette beſyde / but ryght as a man hath done ſo ſhall he haue. And there ſhall be dyuerſe accuſers bothe aboue hym and byneth hym and on euery ſyde. Aboue hym ſhall he our lorde Iheſu cryſte his domes man (Iratus eſt furor domini in populo ſuo) without mercy to them that dyde no mercy / and ſo accuſe them of ye leeſt thought that euer was a mys. On the ryght ſyde his aungell tellynge redely where whan and how often he dyde a mys. On that other ſyde fendes chalengynge hym theyres as by ryght for his wycked dedes. Vnder hym helle redy yf he be founde in ſynne that daye they ſhall be payned and in payne withouten ende. That daye poore people ſhall ſytte with cryſt at the dome / and deme the ryche people for yt grete wronges that they dyde to theym / and they myght gete none amendes tyll the daye of dome / thenne they ſhall haue theyr wyll of the ryche people / for whan the ryche done the poore wronge / they can do nomore but praye to god to quyte theym atte the daye of dome. And ſoo he wyll for god ſayth thus (Michi vindictam et ego retribuā) Put all to me and I yelde euery man after his deſeruynge / therfore whyle

that ye ben here / make ye amendes to them for your wyckednes / and make them your frendes that be your domes men at the daye of dome and truſte not to them that ſhall come after you leeſt ye be begyled. And drede the payne of helle / that neuer ſhall haue ende.

In to ye whiche water he wente euery nyght were it neuer ſoo colde and ſtode therin longe / and ſuffred grete penaunce. And whan that he was aſked why he dyde ſo to ſuffre that grete penaūce.

               GOod frendes this daye is called in holy chirche yt ſondaye in ſeptuageſme. For cauſe ye holy chirche is moder of all cryſten people / ſhe taketh good hede to the chyldern as a good moder ought to do & for as moche as ſhe ſeeth theym full ſore ſyke in ſynne / and many of theym wounded to the dethe with the ſwerde of ſynne the whiche ſynne hath caught all this yere tofore. And namely this cryſtmaſſe tyme that was ordeyned in holy chirche for grete ſolempnyte / for euery man ſholde be beſy to ſerue god with all his power by cauſe that cryſt hym ſelfe ſhewed that daye ſwetneſſe of loue to all cryſten people. For man he was borne that tyme. And in the ſame fleſſhe and blode as one of vs / and layde in a cradell more poorely than ony of vs / and was cryſtened in water as ony of vs. And alſo he came to a weddynge for to clenſe it from ſynnes / and to make vs holy and brethern to hym / & heyres to ye kyngedome of heuen. ¶For this cauſes all cryſten people owen to be full gladde in theyr ſoules as in that tyme makynge ſolempnyte and myrthe / and makynge them bothe clene in body and in ſoule frome all maner of ſynnes / and geoundynge theym in grete ſadneſſe of loue to god and to all cryſten people doynge grete almes to theym that haue nede. But now the more harme is / for that hyghe & ſolempne feeſt is torned in to foule fylth ſynne and grete ſykenes to the ſoule / as in pryde by dyuerſe wyſe in clothynge and in many dyuerſe gyſe vſynge / in to grete couetyſe / and in to lecherye / ye ſueth alwaye glotonye. In ſlouthe in goddes ſeruyce / as Iapes and vanyte ſyngynge rybaudry ſpekynge / for vanyte cauſed moche ſlouthe for amonge ſuche people he is the mooſt worthy that mooſt harlatry can ſpeke / thus theſe ſolempne and hye feeſtes that were ordeyned to grete worſhyppe of god and of oure bleſſed lady and al

the ſayntes in heuen now ben torned in to grete offence to god / Wherfore our moder holy chirche ſeynge her chyldern in ſuche dyſpayre / as a moder full of compaſſyon / ſory in her herte for theym. This daye ſhe leyeth doune alleluya & and other ſonges of myrthe and melodye / and taketh tractus / that ben ſonges of mornynge. ¶Alſo for this holy ſacramente of weddynge is moche defouled by vanyte of ſynne / therfore it is leyde doune theſe dayes / and in aduente. For many that ben now wedded gyueth theym in all luſte and lykynge of the bodyes of fleſſhely luſte of this worlde. And thynketh full lytell of the dethe that is full greuous that cometh ſoo ſone after. But as it is redde by grete clerkes / it is more ſpedefull to mannes ſoule to goo to an hous there as is a corps and wepynge / than to goo to an houſe there as is grete reuell and moche myrthe / for ſuche thynges maken a man to forgete his god and hym ſelfe bothe / but there as is a ſyghte of a corſe maketh a man to thynke on his dethe / that is the ſpecyal thynge to putte awaye ſynne and vanyte of the worlde. For Solamon ſayth thus to his ſone (Fili memorare nouiſſima tua et ineternum none peccabis) Sone haue in thy mynde that thou ſhall deye & thou ſhall neuer ſynne deedly / thus holy chirche hauynge grete compaſſyon of her chyldern ordeyneth thre maner of ſalues to helpe and to hele her chyldern that ben to thynke on dethe Inwardely / to labour beſely and to chaſtyſe the body reſonably. The fyrſt is to thynke on deth Inwardly / holy chirche gyueth enſāple this day in ye offyce of the maſſe (circūdederūt me) The ſykenes of deth hath beclyped me / thꝰ ſayth he techȳge euery gode childe to haue in mȳde how he is beſtade wt deth on euery ſyde / in ſo moche yt he may not ſcape no waye / but euer deth ſueth hym wt a bow drawen and an arowe euer therin redy to ſhote hym he wote neuer what tyme. ¶This is a pryncypall ſalue to euer man that

taketh it to herte to put awaye all maner of vanyte & vayne myrthe. But for to vnderſtonde this the better I ſhewe this by enſample.

He that wyll not labour here in this worlde / he ſhall labour with the fendes in helle. For that is the teſtament of Adam / that he lefte to all his ofſprynge

labour and traueyle. ¶To this labour he gyueth enſample and reherſeth how god made Adam and Eue to labour & to kepe paradyſe / and he badde theym ete of all the fruytes that was in paradyſe excepte one tree that he kepte for hȳ
                  ſelf / and as often as they ſawe ye tree they ſholde thynken on hym that made theym & knowe hym for theyr god And for they ſholde not ete therof in payne of the deth & of dampnacyon / Thenne the fende ſawe theym in ſo moche Ioye that they were in & hym ſelf in ſo moche payne & woo that he hadde grete enuye to theym & wente to Eue & aſked her why they ete not of ye fruyte of that tree. And ſhe ſayd god hath forbode vs that tree in to payne of deth. Then ſayd ye fende wote full well yt yf ye ete therof ye ſholde be lyke god knowynge bothe good & euyll / & yf ye wyl proue yt I ſaye ſothe / ete therof & aſſaye. Then toke Eue of ye fruyte & gaaf Adam & badde hȳ ete therof & aſſay / And he loued her well & wolde not wrathe her / toke an apple and ete / And anone therwith eyther of theȳ ſawe others ſhappe and were aſhamed. And toke leues of a fygge tree and ſo couered her mē
                  bres. Than came our lorde to Adam & ſayd (Quare feciſti hoc) Why haſt yu do ſo. And he ſayd (Mulier quā dediſti mi chi ſociam) The woman badde me. And then ſayd our lorde to Eue. Why dydeſt yu thus (Serpens decepit me) The ſerpent begyled me Thenne for they myght not deye in paradyſe ne ſuffre no penaunce therfore he droof theȳ naked out in to this worlde yt is full wretched wepynge & waylynge to go & gete theyr mete wt grete labour & traueylle and deye at the laſte. Than prayed Adam our lord ſore wepȳg he ſholde not take grete vengaunce vpon them / but haue mercy on theym and pyte / for they were begyled by enuye and malyce of the fende / and by Innocen
                     •••

them in pylches / & badde them go labour and traueyle for theyr lyuynge / and ſayd to Eue (In dolore paries filios) In ſorowe and woo thou ſhalt bere thy childern / and toke Adam Inſtrumentes to labour with & lefte them there. ¶By this ye ſhall vnderſtande & take enſample to labour beſely. For and Adam and Eue had laboured beſely the fende had neuer ouercome theym. For the fende deſyreth noo more whan he wolde tempte a man but for to fynde hym ydle And therfore knowe ye well that it is a ryche ſalue agaynſt ſynne for to labour beſely. ¶The thyrde is to chaſtyſe the body dyſcretly (Vnde Paulus. Caſtigo corpus meum et in ſeruitutē redigo) I ſhall chaſtyſe my body / & dreſſe it in ſeruyce of my ſoule / for mānes fleſſhe is ſo wylde & ſo luſty to ſynne that it wyll not in no waye leue his luſte to ſerue god but yf it be chaſtyſed with penaūce For it muſt be chaſtyſed ſome tyme with payne Thus dyde Adam and Eue in enſample that al other that ſhall come after them ſholde do the ſame For many a yere before her deth eyther of theym ſtode in water a nyghtes vp to the chyn one ferre from an other to ſuffre penaunce tyll her fleſſhe was as grene as graſſe / for colde. Thenne come that fende to Eue as bryght as an angell & ſayd that god hath ſent hym from heuen / & badde her go to Adam and ſaye to hym that god badde hym leue his penaunce / for his treſpace was forgyuen. ¶And Eue dyde ſo / but Adam wyſt well that it came from the fende and not from god He ſayd to Eue whan god droof vs out of paradyſe for our ſynne and had compaſſyō on vs / for we wept ſore on hym / and prayed hym mekely of mercy he ſetted vs here to penaunce to our lyues ende. ¶And therfore go agayne / for the more penaunce that we do the more ſhall be our mede. ¶And therfore go agayne and do thy penaunce in goddes name. ¶Yet the fende come agayne the ſeconde tyme and ſayd to Eue god

of his grace hath take rewarde to youre penaunce that ye ſuffre and hath forgyue you. Thenne wente Eue to Adam and tolde hym ſoo. Thenne ſayd Adam. I wote well that he that hath ſayd ſoo to the is oure enemye / for our penaunce greueth more hym than vs and he wolde haue vs to leue of and ſoo to leſe our mede / but do we forth our penaunce to oure lyues ende. For god taketh none hede to the begynnynge of a thynge but to the endynge. Yet the fende came agayne the thyrde tyme to Eue and ſayd / goo thou to Adam & ſaye to hym yt he began foule and well fouler wyl ende / for fyrſte he treſſpaced by Innocenſye and dyſceyte of the fende / and now he ſynneth by good delyberacyon and wyll not doo as god byddeth hym wherfore youre treſpace is worthy dampnacyon. Thenne was Eue aferde and tolde Adam ſo. Thenne Adam ſyghed ſore and wepte and ſayd to her vnauyſed. Woman god made the of one of my rybbes for to helpe me & comforte me. And now by techynge of the fende thou arte beſy too combre me agayne / but thynke how oure fyrſte ſynne ſtanke in the ſyght of god / yt all oure ofſprynge ſhall be enfecte and haue repreue therof in to the worldes ende. Wherfore though we myght doo ſo moche penaunce as all oure ofſprynge myght do / yet it were to lytell to quyte oure lorde god for our treſpace but god of his ſpecyall grace alowed a good wyll. Thenne wente Eue agayne to her penaunce as Adam badde / and than ſayd Adam god wyl ſende vs the oyle of mercy whan tyme of mercy is. ¶And ſo Adam and Eue dyde theyr penaunce to theyr lyues ende. And whan Adam had lyued .ix.C. yere and .xxx and had .xxx. ſones and .xxx. doughters they deyed & were both buryed togyder Adā & eue. Thꝰ ye may ſe wel yt Adam & eue were ful holy or they dyed / & thought on dethe full Inwardely and laboured full beſely / & chaſtyſed her fleſſhe full reſonably / and ſo muſte we do ye come of

Then as we rede in holy chirche as Moyſes was in ye deſerte of Synay god ſpake to hym and ſayd (Vidi afflictionē populi mei que eſt in egipto clamorē eiꝰ audiui) Pharao ye kynge of Egypte oppreſſed ſo the people of Iſraell with boundage and vnreſonable werkes / and they for woo cryed to me for ſocour & helpe / wherfore go thou thyder and brynge theym oute of theyr boundage & I ſhall be with the.

mekeneſſe / holy faders tellen for thre cauſes. ¶One is the nyght before that our lorde was taken / he went vnto ye mounte of Olyuete and prayed thus (Pater mi ſi poſſible eſt: tranſeat calix iſte) My fader yf it be poſſyble that this bytter paſſyon may paſſe fro me / yf it were the faders wyl and ellys not. And for drede and fere of that bytter paſſyō that he felte in ſpyryte / he ſwette bothe blood and watyr. ¶And an other cauſe is this / that anone after mydnyghte came Iudas with fyfty knyghtes and moche other people to take Cryſt And for it was derke / & they coude not well knowe him from ſaynt Iames he was ſo lyke Cryſt. Therfore Iudas ſayd (Quem oſculatus fuero tenete eum) For ſothe quod he / hym that I ſhal kyſſe / it is / and take ye hym for ſaynte Iames was ſoo lyke our ſauyoure Iheſu Cryſt that the mooſt parte of all the people called hym Cryſtys owne broder.

And thenne after that the Iewes came as preuely as they coude for fere and drede of the comyn people wherfore as this daye there is no belle ronge vnto ſeruyce / but ſowne made of woode or

of tree / wherby all cryſten people may haue knowlege and vnderſtondynge for to come vnto this holy ſeruyce preuely and ſecretely without makynge ony maner of noyſe. And more ouer and all that the people ſholde ſpeke of comynge and goynge ſholde ſowne of tree that is for to ſaye the holy croſſe that oure ſauyoure Iheſu Cryſte was ſpredde vpon and of his bytter paſſyō and alſo of the wordes that our ſauyoure Iheſu Cryſte ſpake hangynge on the croſſe and alſo how he ſayd vnto his blyſſed moder (Mulier ecce filius tuus) Woman ſe thy ſone / and thenne oure lorde commaunded his blyſſed moder vnto ſaynte Iohan the Euangelyſte in kepynge. And what ſayd the theef that henge by hym & he ſayd thus (Domyne quādo veneris in regnū tuum memento mei (Lorde whan thou comeſt into thy kyngedome haue mynde on me.

The water and the wyne that it is waſſhen with betokeneth the blode and the water yt ranne downe from his woundes that was in his ſyde peryſhed with a ſpere. The wyne that is pored vpon the awter on the fyue croſſes betokeneth the blode that rā
                  ne downe frome his precypall woundes of his body. Alſo this day is no paxe gyuen at ye maſſe / for Iudas betrayed Cryſt this nyght with a kyſſe / thus was the propheſye of his paſſyon this daye ended / wherfore as this nyghte whan he had ſouped / he made the ſacramente of his owne body and gaue it to his dyſcyples to ete and drynke / and began the ſacramente of the maſſe and of the newe lawe and after ſouper he wyſſhe his diſcyples feet / that was a maner of the newe lawe full out. For as he ſayd to peter he that is waſſhen and is clene of dedly ſynne hath no nede to be waſſhen it betokeneth the afflyccyon of dedly ſynne And thenne yf the people aſke why preeſtes do not Maſſe after ſouper

as Cryſt dyde. It was tourned in to more honeſt & more ſaluacyon to mannes ſoule. For as Haymo telleth vpon ye pyſtle of ſaynt Poule that many in the begynnynge of the fayth come to the chirche on ſherethurdaye / and thoſe that were ryche brought mete and drynke with theym / and eten and dranke theyr bellyes full and thenne atte nyght tooke theyr houſell / and ſayd that cryſte gaue them enſample / but whan the ryche ete and dranke to moche the poore people abydeth withoute tylle after the ryche hath done ſore an hū
                  gred and thenne ete of the releef that they lefte / and ſoo after the people toke theyr houſell / where as the pyſtle of this daye telleth / ſaynt Poule rebuked theym therof / and tourned that foule vſe in to more honeſt / clenneſſe & holyneſſe / that is for to ſaye atte maſſe faſtynge all the people to take theyr houſell faſtynge. On Eeſter euen the paſcall is made the chyef tapre in the chirche / ſoo is cryſte chyef aboue all ye ſayntes in heuen. The paſcall alſo betokeneth the pyler of lyght fyre that wente before Moyſes and the chyldern of Iſraell whan Moyſes ladde theym out of Egypte in to the londe of byheſt / that is Iheruſalem / and ſoo they paſſed ſaue and ſounde. And ſoo ſeuen dayes after they come all vnto the ſee and thanked god for theyr paſſage. And in mynde here of holy chirche vſeth all the Eeſter weke to goo a proceſſyon to the fonte / that is now the reed ſee to all cryſten people that ben cryſtened in the fonte. For the water in the fonte betokeneth the reed ſee / for bloode and water is the wounde that were in Cryſtes ſyde in the whiche power of Pharao the fende of helle is drowned and all his myght loſte / and Cryſten people ſaued and for the fonte is halowed on Eeſter euen and on wytſon euen / for in the begynnynge all chyldern abode too be cryſtened vnto theſe two dayes / and to be cryſtened atte the fonte halowynge. But now for by cauſe that many in ſo longe abydȳge were deed withouten cryſtendome / therfore holy chyrche ordeyned

now to cryſten all tymes of the yere ſaue eyght dayes by fore theſe euyns / that chylde ſhall a byde too the fonte halowynge yf it may for peryl of deth and ellys not / thus is the paſcall halowed by lyght with the newe fyre. And of it all other tapres and candelles ben lyght for al holynes & good techynge and good lyuynge cometh of cryſt / and techynge of holy chyrche and lyghteth them in cryſtes paſſyon with brennyng loue. and charyte. Pyeces of conſcyence ben ſtycked in the paſcall in the maner of a croſſe thoſe be token the fyue woundes of our lorde As Bede ſayeth / that he ſuffred in his body / that ſhall be freſſhe and ſwete as ony enſcence tyl the day of dome to grete repreef to all that ſhall be dampned that byleue not in cryſtes paſſyō and wyl not aſke mercy and for yeuenes of theyr ſynnes. In the fonte halowynge the preeſte caſteth water in foure partyes of the fonte / for cryſte had his dyſcyples goynge prechynge and techynge in foure partyes of cryſtendome. In the name of the fader and the ſone and the holy ghooſt. And after the preeſt bretheth on the water / for the holy ghoſt in makyng of the worlde was borne on waters. For whan god for Adams ſynne curſyd the erthe and the londe / he curſed not the water / wherfore it is lawfull for a man to ete in lenten that ye cometh of the water. After he droppeth the wexe in to the water of a candell brennyng the whiche betokeneth the mā
                  hode of cryſt that was fulled in water / and putteth oyle & creme in the water. For by ye vertue of the ſacramente thoſe that ben in heuen and in erthe be Ioyned to gyder / and that was preued by Cryſtes baptyſme / for there the fader of heuen ſpake and ſayd (Hic eſt filius meus dilectꝰ in quo mi
                     •
                  hi bene cōplacui) This is my welbeloued ſone that wyll pleaſe me. And the holy ghooſt (Sicut columba) As a whyte douue. ¶Thus was the

Thenne frome the fonte the people gone to the quere ſyngynge the letanye / prayenge all the ſayntes in heuen to praye to god to gyue to all yt ben cryſten to kepe that worthy ſacrament to goddes pleaſaunce / & the couenaūt that they haue made in theyr cryſtenynge. Thenne the preeſt gooth to maſſe For Cryſte that is heed of all holy chirche is not ryſen. Kyryeleyſon is ſayd / for in euery prayer in eſpecyall in the maſſe it is grete nede to aſke helpe and ſocour of god to kepe vs frome all maner of temptacyon that the fende putteth in vs and namely in goddes ſeruyce (Gloria in excelſis (is ſayd. For the fader of heuen hath grete Ioye to beholde the people that his ſone hath bought with his paſſyon / and to ſee them in peas reſte and charyte eche one with other. The greyle is not ſayd / for thoſe that ben newe cryſtened ben not yet parfyte to walke in grace of vertues (Alleuya) is ſayd / for it is grete Ioye to aungels to ſee by cryſtenynge the nombre of them reſtored ayen After (alleluya) a tract is ſayd hyghe ſongen / for thoughe by cryſtenynge they be waſſhed frome ſynne / yet muſt they traueyll beſely to kepe them frome comberaunce of the fende that they falle not in to deedly ſynne. The offertory is ſayd / for the women that comen with oynementes to offre to Cryſtes body they founde hȳ not in his tombe (Agnꝰ dei) is ſayd / but no paxe is gyuen / for Cryſt that is heed of peas is not ryſen. The poſtcomyn is not ſaid. For thoſe that ben newe cryſtened ſholde not be houſeled this day / but on the morowe. For in olde tyme there came to cryſtenynge people of grete age. Thenne a ſhorte euenſonge is done / for the chyldern that were not cryſtened wherof gretely they were noyed with ſykenes of colde of longe ſeruyce. Thenne it is endeth vnder a ſhorte colet. All ye ſacramente of cryſtenynge is ended in the paſſyon of Cryſte by the whiche all cryſten people were reſtored to euerlaſtynge blyſſe. To ye

            ¶In die paraſceues.
            
               GOod frendes this daye is called good frydaye. For al that our lorde Iheſu cryſt ſuffred this daye tourned vs to grete Ioye / for this daye he ſuffred paſſyon vnder ponce Pylate for our ſake / It is an olde ſawe that a foule begynnynge hathe a foule endynge. Now ſe how this Pylate began curſedly and endeth full wretchedly. For as ſaynt Auſtyn ſayeth Curſed lyuynge fyrſt aſketh a curſed ende / after he that forgeteth hym ſelfe here in his lyuynge / is full lyke to forgete hymſelf in his laſt ende. This Pylate was a knyghtes ſone that was called Tyrus / that he gate hym on a womā that hyght Pyle / and this womans fader hyght Ate. So whan this chylde was borne they ſette his moders name and the grande fader after / and ſo by bothe names called hym Pylate. Thenne after whan he was thre yere of aege his moder broughte hym to the kynges courte. Than had the knyght an other ſone nye lyke to Pylates aege. But for this knyghtes ſone was in all rule more gentyller / more manfully / more goodly / more beloued than this Pylate / ſo for hate & enuye therof this Pylate on a daye ſlewe this knyghtes ſone / Then was the knight wonder ſory / but yet he wolde not ſle Pylate & ſent hym to Rome to be there in hoſtage for a trybute yt the knyght ſholde paye to themperour. Than it happed yt the kynge of fraunce had ſent his ſone thyder for ye ſame cauſe. Thē for this cauſe whan Pylate ſawe that he was more beloued and cheryſſhed / therfore this Pilate ſlewe hȳ Then for he was ſo curſed the Emperour by counceyle of ye Romaynes ſent Pylate in to a countre that was called Pō
               ce where that the people of the coūtre were ſo curſed yt they ſlewe ony yt came to be theyr mayſter ouer them. So whan

Pylate came thyder / he applyed hym to theyr maners / ſo yt with wyles and ſubtylte he ouercame them & had the mayſtry and gate his name and was called Pylate of Ponce / & had grete domynacyon and power. Then the kynge of Iheruſalem ſent for him and made hym lyuetenaunt vnder hȳ of the londe of Iury / & for Pylate lyked well thoffyce / pryuely he ſent to themperour and had his offyce confermed of hym vnwetynge to the kynge Herode that tyme beynge kȳ
               ge. Wherfore whan kynge Herode herde what he had done he was ſo wrothe that they were enmyes vnto the tyme yt our lorde Iheſu cryſt was take / and than they became frendes agayne and fell bothe in to one aſſent of Cryſtes dethe Thenne it happened afterwarde ye themperour fel ſeke and ſent for Cryſte for to hele hym / for it was tolde hym that Cryſt heled all them that euer wolde come to hym of al maner ſekenes what ſo euer it had be. But then had Pylate done hym to dethe or the meſſenger came. Then whan the emperour vnderſtode that he ſente for Pylate and made hym come to hym. And as Pylate herde this he was ſore aferde & toke on cryſtes cote / and ſo whan he came to Rome to the emperour / all they that were in preſence made Pylate good chere all the whyle that he had on Cryſtes cote. And the emperoure ſwore before that he ſholde be deed. Thenne toke they of the cote and anone as the cote was of / the Emperoure was ſore wrothe with Pylate that he put hym in to a pryſon tyll he hadde taken counceyl what dethe he ſholde deye on. Thenne as ſoone as Pylate wyſt and vnderſtode that he ſholde be deed / he toke his owne knyfe and ſlewe hym ſelfe therwith. And whan the Emperour herde therof and dyde vnderſtande that he hadde ſlayne hym ſelf with his knyfe / thenne anone he commaunded for to bynde a grete ſtone about the forſayd Pylates necke and for to caſte hym in to the ryuer of Rome that is named Tyber without euer for to be ſene of the people· Thenne whan he was caſten therin

the fendes made ſuche a noyſe there aboute that all the cyte of Rome was ſore afreyed. Thenne whan the Emperoure ſawe this / he made to take hym vp ayen. And thenne was he caſte in to a water that was bytwix two hye hylles. And ſo longe tyme after there was in the water many horryble ſyghtes ſeen aboute that curſed man. ¶Thus oure lorde Iheſu Cryſte ſuffred paſſyon and dethe for all mankynde / And fyrſte whan he was taken they dyde buffet hym and ſtryped hym naked / and bete hym with ſcourges (A vertice capitis vſ

                ad plantas pedum non fuit in eo ſanitas. That frome the hyeſt place of his heed to the ſoole of his feet was no thynge lefte hole on hym but all rawe. And after made a crowne of thornes & ſette it on his heed and bete it doune with ſtaues of reed that it peryſſhed his brayne. And whan they had payned hym ſo / they ladde hym forth all blody (Admontē caluarie) To the mount of Caluarye to thende of dethe / yet women of the cyte whā they ſee hym ſo foule faren with and all to lugged and to drawen / for veray pyte they wepte vpon hym. Thenne ſayd our lorde to them (Nolite flere ſuper me. ſed ſuper vos & filios veſtros) Ye women of Iheruſalem wepe ye not for me / but vpon you and youre chyldern. For there ſhall dayes come / in the whiche ye ſhall blyſſe the wombes that were barayne and the pappes that neuer gaue ſouke. Thus oure lorde preched before the vengeaunce that fylle after vpon Iheruſalem. The whiche prophecye Iheremye the prophete ſpake of / that is redde in holy chirche theſe thre dayes atte tenebras / the whiche was ſo horryble of many dyuerſe myſchyues / and in eſpecyall of hungre / that chyldern laye deed for hungre in the ſtretes. Thenne was there a waman that was come of grete byrthe / that for hungre tooke her owne chylde that was deed with her pappes and ſlewe it and parted it in two partyes / and than ſhe roſted halfe and the other halfe ſhe kepte tylle on the morowe. Thenne as the people came by the ſtrete

they hadde ſauoure of the roſt and anone they came in to haue hadde parte therof. And whan they ſawe the moder roſte her owne chylde. and ſoone they were heuy and foule dyſmayed / and wolde not ete therof but wente theyr waye forth ayen. Thenne tooke the moder of that chylde and ete therof / and ſayd in this maner wyſe. This is myn owne ſone and myn owne chylde that I bare of my body / and fedde it with my pappes but I wyll rather ete it than deye for hungre / therfore I telle you this to ſhewe you ſomwhat of the vengeaunce that fylle on Iheruſalem after the dethe of oure lorde Iheſu Cryſt. Thenne they ladde hym to ye moūt of Caluarye and there they ſtreyned hym ſoo on the croſſe that euery bone of his body myght be knowen one from an other. And nayled hym honde and foote to the croſſe and they lyfte vp the croſſe and the boody togyder / and with a grete peyce they lete the croſſe and the body falle doune togyder in to the morteſſe / that all the body daſſhed and his bones craked / and his Ioyntes and vaynes braſte oute of blode ſydes / armes / legges / feet / and hondes / ſo that there was no blode lefte in hym. And yet they toke a clothe whyle the blode was hote / and wonde it aboute his body tylle the blode was colde / and thenne they drewe awaye the clothe and pulled awaye the fleſſhe fro the bones. This was a grete pyte. And ſoo whan he ſholde deye / he began as Iohan belet ſayth (Deus meus reſpice in me) And ſoo ſayd all the verſes ſuynge tylle he come vnto that verſe (In te dn̄e ſperaui) And ſoo atte this verſe (In manus tuas dn̄e commendo ſpiritum meum. redemiſti me domine deus veritatis) There he gaue vp the ſpyryte. This is a grete enſample that oure lorde Iheſu Cryſte gaue to all cryſten people that euery man ſholde haue in mynde theſe verſes / and he that can theym ſaye / and ſaye theym euery daye / he ſhall not deye no maner myſchyuous nor vengeable deth. Then after this paſſyon we ſaye oryſones and knelynge at euery

oryſon ſaue at that oryſon that is ſayd for the Iewes / at ye oryſon holy chyrche kneled not by cauſe the Iewes in ſcorne knelynge thre tymes to Cryſt whan they ſcrourged hym Thenne thyſe oryſons holy chirche prayed for all maner of people / for Iewes Saraſyns cyſmatyks heretyks but not for cryſten people for whyle ony man or woman ſtandeth acurſyd / he is dampned before god / and dampned ſhall he be at his deth. but he repente hȳ & made hȳ whyle he lyueth in this preſente worlde. But take hede what ſaynt Auſtyn ſayth (Siſcirem ꝓ certo ꝙ pater meus eſſet in inferno non orarem pro illo niſi vt ꝓ dyabolo) Yf I wyſt for trouth that my fader were dampned in to helle. I wolde neuer praye for hym but as for the deuyll of helle / for ther is no prayer of holy chirche that helped a dampned man. Thenne after thyſe oryſons the croſſe is brought forth / to the whiche all cryſten people ſholde worſhyp of hym that this daye deyed on the croſſe / and praye our lorde to forgiue vs our treſpace as Cryſt prayed to his fader of heuen to forgyue theȳ that dyde hym on the croſſe.

with other people to ſerue god. And as he was in the chirche / anone this other knyght had worde and come with moche people in to the chirche and his ſwerde drawen in his honde for to ſlee hym. And whan this other knyght ſawe that and wyſt well that he had treſpaced to hym / he fylle downe flatte to the grounde with his armes ſpradde abrode as our lorde Iheſu cryſte ſpradde his armes on the croſſe and ſayd. For his loue that this daye ſpradde hi armes on ye croſſe and ſuffredde paſſyon and deyed for the and me and for al mankynde / haue thou mercy on me & forgyue me thy ſones deth. Thenne this knyght thought it had be to horryble a thynge to ſmyte hym whyle that he laye ſo and cryed hym mercy ſo mekely: And anone he put vp his ſwerde and ſayd to hym in this maner wyſe Now for his loue that this day deyed on the croſſe for the and me and all mankynde.

For they had loſt her mayſter yt they loued full well and for hym had loſt all her goodes for his loue / and forſoke all her frenſhyp / and ſerued hym full poore / in hope that they ſholde be gretely holpen by hym And thus they were all heuy and gretly aſtonyed and ſore aferde to be taken of the Iewes and caſte in pryſon / and after to be put to deth. This made them ſore that they durſt not go amonge the people for to gete them mete and drynke. But yet as Cryſte badde theȳ in his aſcēſyon / they wente in to the cyte of Iheruſalem / and there they were in a halle of ſtage. And there they ſate togyder prayenge vnto god with hole herte / and one ſpyryte of helpe & ſocoure / and ſo me comforte in theyr dyſeaſe. Thenne as they were thus praycnge togyder / ſodenly there was a grete clowde made

in the ayre lyke a blaſt of thonder / and euen therwith the holy gooſt came amonge theym. (Et apparuerunt illis diſpertite lingue tan
                  
                     
                  
                  quam
                ignis). And a lyght came doune amonge them in lykenes of tongues brennynge and not ſmertȳ
               ge / warmynge / and not harmȳge / lyghtnynge and not flytterynge. (Et repleti ſūt omnes ſpiritu ſancto). And fylled theym all full of gooſtly wytte. For as they were tofore but lewde men of ſyght and vnlettred and very ydeottes as of connynge / and nothȳge coude of clergye / ſodaynly they were the wyſeſt men of the worlde. And anone they ſpake all maner of languages vnder the ſonne. And there as before theyr hertes were colde for grete drede & fere of deth. They were than ſo gretely comforted of the holy gooſt in brennȳ
               ge loue / that they went and preched and taught the worde of god / ſparynge for noo drede / but redy to ſuffre dethe for cryſtes ſake. Than at that tyme there were in Iheruſalem people of all nacyons / and drewe in to the temple for grete fere of the blaſte of thonder that was in the ayre / and ſtudyed what it might be. Then came the appoſtles in to the temple and preched. And all maner of nacyons vnderſtode thē and they vnderſtode all maner of nacyons / and ſo they preched the worde of god. Then were the people aſtonyed whā they herde the appoſtles ſpeke all maner languages. Than ſayd ſome they haue dronken ſo moche that they wote not what they do ſay / neyther what they meane / for they be all dronken. Then anſwered Peter and ſayd / we ben not dronken / but this was the prophecye of Iohel the prophete / how the holy gooſt ſholde be giuen plenteuouſly to the people / ſo that they ſholde ſpeke with all tongues / that is to preche in all the worlde the lawes of Iheſu Cryſt. And then the people torned faſte / & ſo within fewe yeres the fayth was in all the worlde. ¶Now it is to wyte why the holy ghooſt appered more in the lykenes of tongues than in to ony other partye

of mannes body / and why he came to them ſyttynge rather than ſtandynge. As to the fyrſt this is the cauſe. A tongue is the beſt membre of a mannes body whā it is in good rule and well dyſpoſed / but whan it is oute of rule it is the worſt. (Venenū aſpidum ſub labiis eorum). Bytter venȳ is vnder the tongue that ſpeketh euyll ſayeth Dauyd in the pſalter. And as ſaynt Iames ſayth. A curſed tongue is fyred with the fyre of hell / and may not be chaſtyſed whyle ye fyre brenneth it / and alſo for tongues muſte ſpeke wordes of fyre / that is ſharpe and ſperkelynge to ſaye trouthe / and not ſpare in prechynge / & to repreue myſdedes / for as holy men in olde tyme ouercame and droue away ye fyre of lyghtnynge with holy wordes & good prayers with the brennynge loue to god. Ryght for that fyre of the holy ghooſt ſholde dryue away / and ouercome the fyre of helle that enuy hath and euyl lyuynge / that reygneth now in moche people / and in hertes. And for appoſtles and other prechers yt cometh after hym ſholde ſpeke brennynge wordes / that is neyther to ſharpe / neyther for drede / ne for loue to ſaye the trouthe and to tell the people theyr defautes and to repreue the ſynnes that reygneth in them in many dyuers wyſe / and ſo to do / and ſay the worde of god and to repreue ſynne / and but they wyll leue ſynne they ſhall without remedye be dampned in to the fyre of hell. For though thou ſholdeſt deye ſpare not to relate the worde of god and tell the trouthe. (Itē deus eſt miſericors penitentibꝰ peccata ſua. Alſo god is mercyfull to theym that be ſory for theyr ſynnes and wyll leue them. (Cū vero confeſſus fuerit et reliquerit ea: miſericor diam conſequatur) For though a man had done neuer ſoo moche ſynne / and he wyll ſhryue hym / and forſake his ſȳne mercy ſhall folowe hym and he ſhall haue forgyuenes / & ſoo come to the bryght fyre of euerlaſtynge blyſſe. That is the precyous loue of god that brenneth amonge the aungelles

and ſayntes in the kyngdome of heuen. Alſo he cometh in lykeneſſe of tonges of fyre. For it is the kynde of fyre to make lowe that is hyghe / and to warme that is colde / to make ſofte that is harde and make harde yt is ſofte / And alſo the holy ghooſt maketh hertes that ben hyghe of pryde and enuye / he maketh theym lowe and warme in loue and charyte And alſo harde hertes yt haue be gaderynge and holdynge of worldly goodes the holy ghooſt maketh theym ſofte & lyberall to gyue and deale almeſdedes for the loue of almyghty god oure lorde Iheſu cryſt / and maketh theym harde alſo in ſufferynge of harde & ſtrate lyuynge / & in doynge of grete penaunce for theyr ſynnes. Thus the holy ghooſt is euer redy to make ſalue for to hele all maner of ſȳnes That othet ſkyll is why the holy ghoſt come to the apoſtles rather ſyttynge than ſtandynge for ſyttynge betokeneth mekenes in herte / with reſt peas and vnyte. The whiche ony maner of man muſte nedes haue that wyll receyue the holy ghoſt For ryght as the drye wood wyll brēne clerely without ſterynge Soo ſholde euery cryſten man loue other with brennynge loue and charyte / clerely without feynynge of wrath or enuye / or ony maner of malyce eche with other. And ſo euery man ſholde be fayne of other welfare / & this maketh to haue a good tonge. But as ſoone as the brondes ben caſte a twynne by dyſcenſyon of malyce and enuye / anone the fyre of the holy ghooſt quencheth / and ſo thenne ryſeth vp ſmoke of grete wrath and enuye bytwene partye and partye / and alſo grete greuaunce and heuyneſſe for the ſoule / and cauſeth it to fayle grace / that it may haue no conſyderacyon to reaſon. Thenne anone the wycked ſpyrytes ben redy / and reyſe vp ſmoke in the ſame mannes herte. That is to ſaye / grete wrath and enuye / and euyll wyll / that it may haue no maner of reſte. But euer ſtudyenge and thynkynge alſo / how he may auenge hym / and doo vengeaunce

vnto his enuyes. And ſoo is a man euer troubled and beſy euer in curſyd dedes and lykely for to be dampned bothe body and ſoule in helle to euerlaſtynge payne / but yf he haue ſome ſocoure and helpe of the holy ghooſt. And all ſuche thȳ
               ges that may come of curſyd and wyckede tonges. Therfore the holy ghoſt cometh in the lykeneſſe of tonges of brennynge fyre to brenne out the malyce and enuye / and to anoynte them with ſwetneſſe of grace / loue & charyte. And therfore ſhall we praye to the holy ghoſt for to gyue vs grace ſo to tempre our tōges that we may euermore ſpeke good and that our hertes may be fedde with mekeneſſe▪ that we may be able to be fedde with the holy ghoſt as ſaynt Gregory was / whan he expowned the prophecye / he toke to hym his deken ſaynt Peter to wryte as he expowned / and made drawe bytwene hym for ſaynt Peter ſholde not ſee how he dyde in his ſtandynge. Thenne as Gregory ſat in his chayr holdynge vp his hondes & his eyen to heuen warde the holy ghoſt come lyke a whyte douue with foot and bylle brennȳ
               ge golde and ſat on Gregory ryght ſholder and put her bylle in Gregoryes mouth / and whan he withdrewe it / thenne he bad Peter wryte / and ſo contynued tyll he hadde made an ende / But he expowned the goſpell ſoo boldely that Peter hadde grete wonder and merueyled therof and thē pryuely made an hole in the clothe that was bytwene Gregory and hym / and ſawe how ye holy ghoſt fedde hym. And anone the holy ghooſt ſhewed Gregory how Peter had done. then Gregory blamed Peter / and charged hym yt he ſholde neuer ſaye nothynge whyle he lyued. But whan Gregory was deed an heretyke wolde haue brenned his bokes that this holy man made / and thenne Peter withſtode hym and ſayd nay / & tolde al how the holy ghooſt had done to hym whyle he expowned the prophecye / and ſo ſaued his bokes vnbrenned that he had made by the grace of god & gyfte of

the holy ghooſt. The whiche gyue vs grace to be fedde of hȳ here in our lyuynge that we may haue the blyſſe that neuer ſhall haue ende. Amen.

               GOod men and wȳmen this daye is an hye and a ſolempne feſt in holy chirche / for it is of the holy Trynyte / for as holy chirche at Wytſontyde maketh mencyon how the holy ghoſt came to Cryſtys dyſcyples Now at this tyme is made mencyon of all thre perſones / that is for to ſaye (Pater filius et ſpirituſſanctus) Fader and ſone and holy ghoſt / thre perſones and one god / wherfore we be boūde to do al the reuerē
               ce and worſhyp that we can or may to this holy Trynyte. Alſo ye ſhall vnderſtande why / how / and what the cauſe is that this feſt was ordeyned. This holy feſt was worſhypped for the Trynyte fyrſt fyndynge / for heretykes confoū

Trynyte. The ſeconde cauſe is that feſt is ordeyned in confoundynge of heretykes and lollers for to deſtroye theym & her fals opynyons that they hadde ayenſt the holy Trynyte / for ryght as heretykes in ye begȳnynge of the fayth wt her ſwete wordes & fals opynyōs were about to deſtroy the

But he that ſuffreth trybulacyon perſecucyon and dyſeaſe for ye loue of almyghty god & prayeth for his enemyes and myſdoers / and wyll do no vengeaūce / but put all in god almyghty And he wyll quyte thē full well in euerlaſtynge blyſſe / for our lorde ſayth thꝰ (Michi vindictam et ego retribuā) Put all thynge to me and I ſhall quyte euery man after his deſeruynge / for though god ſuffred holy chirche to be purſued by ſuche myſſe and proude heretykes at the laſt he ordeyned ſuche a remedye yt holy chirche is holpen and her enemyes confoūded and ſhamed Thus it happed on a tyme wt themperour of Rome yt hyght Attilia and he was made by heretykes as Iohan bellet telleth / the whiche Emperour purſued cryſten peple ſore and hated them and holy chyrche gretly. Wherfore he made to brenne all the bokes yt myght be foūde of cryſten fayth. But as almyghty god wolde / there was a good holy man and yt was a grete clerke and that clerke was called Alpynyons. That in mayntenynge of the fayth of holy chirche / he made the ſtory of the Trynyte. & the ſtory alſo of Saynt Steuen and brought it vnto the pope for to haue them ſongen & rede in holy chirche. But by coūſeyl of ye grete clerke they toke the ſtory of ſaynt Steuen / & lefte the ſtory of the holy Trynyte / tyll ye tyme yt ſaynt Gregory was pope thēne for to preue thē & doo thē ſhame yt ben ſuche myſleuynge people

Thenne it is full expedyent & nedefull to all cryſten people to knowe how they ſholde lyue / ye ſhall vnderſtande ye perfyte loue vnto god is the beleue. For he that beleueth perfytely maketh no queſtyons. Fides non habet meritum vbi humana ratio prebet experimentū). Fayth hath no mede ne meryte where mannes wytte gyueth experyence. Then it is good to all cryſten people to make loue to be medyatour to the holy gooſt praynge hym to lyghten vs within our ſoules that we may haue grace to come too his perfyte beleue. Therfore this daye was ſette nexte whytſonday hopynge that ye holy gooſt wyll be redy to all cryſten people that wyl call hym / and ſpecyally in lernynge of the fayth / but yet for mannes wytte be dull to lerne / thenne they may not ſe nor here / but they be brought in by grete enſāple. But thoſe people be not mooſt commendable yf we may by enſample come the ſooner to the beleue / in the fader and the ſone / & the holy gooſt / thre perſones & all one god / take hede to this enſample / of yſe / ſnowe / & water / how that theſe thre ben dyuers eche in ſubſtaunce / & yet all is but water. Ye may vnderſtande by the water of the fader / by the yſe of the ſone / & by the ſnowe of the holy gooſt. Water is an element that hath grete myght and ſtrength. And as mayſter Alyſaūder ſayth. It is aboue heuen in the maner of yſe lyke as cryſtall and dooth worſhyp to heuen / & anone it is vnder erth / & the

For in harde ſtones and yren ſomtyme is ſwete water▪ For this water is ſo full of myght / that is to vnderſtande the fader that is power is ſo moche that he gouerneth all the worlde and knoweth all this / & all thynge is at his cōmaundement. By the ſone Iheſu cryſte ye ſhall vnderſtande yſe that is water congyled harde & bryttle / that is Iheſu cryſt very god & man that toke the ſubſtaunce and fraylte of mankynde whan he was conceyued of the holy gooſt in the vyrgyn Mary / and borne of her body god that ſuffred paſſyon vnder ponce Pylate / done vpon the croſſe deyed / and was buryed / and the thyrde day aroſe from dethe to lyfe / and after on holy thurſdaye ſtyed vp in to heuen / and ſhall come agayne at the day of dome and deme the quicke and the deed. By the ſnowe ye ſhall vnderſtande the holy gooſt / for ryght as ſnowe is but water and yſe & lyght in the ayre / but how no man can tell. Soo cometh the holy ghooſt frome the fader and the ſone.

But how it is for no man to ſtudy / for it excedeth all mannes wytte to ſtudye therupon / but ſadly beleue the fader is full god almyghty / and of hym came the ſone full god / and of them bothe came the holy gooſt ful god.

Then̄e the kyng prayed to Thomas to bleſſe his doughter and her huſbonde. And Thomas was glade ther of Cepit erge predicare beatus thomas) Therfore the bleſſyd Thomas began to preche and tolde theȳ of our lorde Iheſu cryſt yt he torned the man that was wedded ye ſame daye frō his wyf and made hym byſſhop of the ſame Cyte / and his wyf a nonne / and they were martyrs after for Cryſtys ſake.

Thenne as to ye fyrſt cauſe he was borne to gyue men peas of good wyll. I may well preue this For whan he was borne / angels ſonge thus Gloria in excelſis deo). Ioye be to god in heuen / and peaſe in erth to mankynde of good wyll. At mydnyght our lorde was borne for by kynde all thynge was in peas and reſt in ſhewynge that he was & is (princeps pacis) prynce of peas. and come to make peas bytwene god and man. and bytwene the aungell & man / and bytwene man & man And for to be true medyatour betwene god and man / he toke nature and kynde of bothe & was bothe veray god and man / & by his medyacyon he knytte the loue of god to man / ſoo ſadly yt the fader of heuē ſpared not hym that is his owne ſone / but ſent hym doune in to this worlde too bye mankynde wt his precyous blode through his grete mekenes to Ioye of paradyſe that man hadde loſte by couetyſe of vnbuxſomneſſe. Thus he made peaſe bytwene god & man / and man & man. For whan aungelles ſawe theyr mayſter wrothe with man for his vnbuxſomnes / for it is a ſynne that aungelles dooth hate gretely. Therfore they kept the gates of paradyſe / and wolde lette no ſoule come in to paradyſe tyl they ſawe theyr lorde and ſouerayne borne of mankynde and take fleſſhe of the blyſſed vyrgyn Mary his mooſte beloued moder.

Then ther was ſo grete peas that a man yt was called Octauyan Emperour of Rome / and he had ye gouernaūce of all the worlde for all the worlde was ſubget to Rome / & it dured .xxx. yere in ſo moche yt ther was a maundement ſente out from Rome in to all ye worlde / cōmaundynge that all maner of people ſholde go to the Cyte that he drewe lygnage of and laye a peny vpon his heed & offre it vp in know lechynge that he was ſubget to themperour of Rome Then muſt Ioſeph our ladyes huſbonde nedes go to ye cyte of Bethleem for to offre with other peple / but for he had no moneye to offre he toke an oxe wt hym to ſelle at the Cyte to make moneye to do his dute with. But for he durſt not leue our lady bēhȳde hym / for ſhe was nye her tyme & therfor he ſet her vpon an aſſe & tooke her with hym. And ſo whan they came to the cyte of Bethleem / it was ſo full of peple ſo that Ioſeph and our lady myght haue no lodgynge / but torned in to a cabon that was made betwix two houſes there as the people of ye coū

For the tyme was come that ſhe ſholde be delyuered. And ſoo whyle that Ioſeph was in the towne for the mydwyf / our lady was delyuered / and ſhe lapped her ſone in clothes and layde it in the cratche before the oxe and thaſſe / anone they knewe her lorde and fyll downe on her knees and worſhypped hym / and ete no more of the heye. Thenne anone after came Ioſeph with two mydwyues zebell and Salome / & zebell founde that our lady was a clene mayden & cryed and ſayd / (Virgo peperit filium) A mayde hath born a childe Thenne Salome wolde not byleue it / but anone went to our lady and bouſtouſly handled our lady (Probare vellet) And ſhe wolde preue it / and euen ther with her hondes dryed vp Thenne came an angell to her and badde her ſhe ſholde go & touche ye childe. and ſo ſhe dyde and anone ſhe was hole. Thenne wente Ioſeph and dyde his offrynge with other people / and kept our lady in the ſame cabon whyle ſhe was in childe bedde Thus ye may vnderſtāde that Cryſt gyueth peas to all people that be of a good wyll and called hem his childern.

For as ſaynt Auſtyn ſayth whan our lorde ſholde be borne the worlde was full of derkeneſſe and ſpecyally of ſynne of lechery / and of the ſynne ayenſt kynde. In ſo moche that he had almooſt left to haue be borne of mankynde / wherfore al thoſe that dyden ſynne ayenſt kȳde that tyme / they deyed ſodenly thrugh out all the worlde / in ſhewynge how horryble and abhomynable that ſynne is in the ſyght of almyghty god. Thenne loked they full derke in ſynne that had theyr thoughtes alwaye in ſynne & euyll lyuynge / and hadde full grete nede for to be lyghtned. Wherfor Cryſt was borne at mydnyght. And tourned the derkeneſſe of the nyght in to the daye lyght. and lyghtened all theym that euer were couered and combred with derkeneſſe of ſynne ¶Alſo the ſame tyme that our lorde was borne as many doctours ſayen Cryſt appered in a bryght ſterre to the kynges of theſt and badde them go to Bethleem / and worſhyp a lytell childe that ſholde be kyng of Iewes that was there now borne / and ſo they dyde / And euer the ſterre ſhewynge before theym tyll they came thyder. Thus he lyghtened theym that before were full derke in ſynne / for theſe kynges were paynems before and bileued in mawmetry and in fals goddes / and after they byleued in Cryſte and were holy lyuers. And now be at Coleyne. ¶Thus the byrth of our lorde Iheſu cryſt made many a man loke full bryght that tofore were ful derke in ſynne. For he is full derke in his ſoule that euer ſetteth his herte / mynde / & thought in the proſperyte worſhyp and welfare of this worlde / and that maketh them ſo inwardly blynde and ſoo ignoraunt that they haue no felynge of the grete and ineſtimable grace of ghoſtly ſyght / but ben made blynde and abuſed with the tranſytory rycheſſe of this wycked worlde / and for couetyſe therof they commytte vſury / and ſo they gete theyr

For to dyſtroye all ſuche mawmetry of ſynne our lorde was borne. Thenne the kynge Herode purſued our lorde and wolde haue ſlayne hym. Thenne his moder bare hym in too Egypte / as an aungell badde Ioſeph and ſayd. Accipe puerum et matrē eius & fuge in egiptum). Take the chylde & his moder / and flee with them in to Egypte. And as ſoone as he came thyder / all the mawmettes that were in the londe fell doune to the grounde doynge to vnderſtande that he was come in to the worlde that ſholde caſt downe the mawmetry of all maner ſyn̄e and euyll lyuynge. Pryde couetyſe and all maner of falſhede that is vſed no we a dayes. And therfore take hede how that lorde that made all maner thynge of nought / & is lorde of all lordes.

For haue a man neuer ſo grete worſhyp & neuer ſo moche rycheſſe / yet he leueth it here / and ſhall bere no more with hym but his good dedes. Thus our lorde ſhewed many thynges in his byrthe / and lyghtned many one that here before were full blynde. In tokenynge herof the ſeconde maſſe this daye is ſayd in the dawnynge / whan the nyght and the daye departeth / the whiche begynneth thus. Lux fulgebit hodie). That is thus moche to ſaye. Lyghte ſhall ſhyne this daye vpon vs / for the fader of heuen ſēdeth the grace of the gooſtly lyght to all cryſten people that beleue truly that our lorde was borne very god and man of his moder Mary very moder and mayden. Thus they that beleue truely in our lorde Iheſu Cryſte and his moder Mary ſet full lytell by the vanytees of the worlde / but put al theyr hope and truſte in Iheſu cryſte. Thus the byrthe of our lorde

Iheſu cryſt lyghtned many one that before loked full yll Alſo he drew vs to hym with loue. For chyldren drawe too them that maketh moche of them & playe with them. Thus our lorde Iheſu cryſte was borne a chylde / the fayreſt that euer was borne to drawe mannes loue to hym. For whyle a chylde is yonge / and without ſynne he is more amyable & more louynge thenne he is at mannes aege / and is paſte Innocencye with doynge. Sythen the loue is not onely for his beaute / but for the clennes of the ſoule / and alſo for the goodnes. Eche man is bounde for to drawe to hym and do hym worſhyppe / as Octauyan dyde themperour of Rome that pleaſed ſo moche the people of his Empyre of Rome yt they wolde haue worſhypped hym as for theyr god. But ye emperoure was wyſe and wyſt wel that he was but a man as an other was / and durſt not take that vpon hym. But a none he ſent after Sybyll the ſage and aſked her / whether ſholde ony be borne after hym that ſholde be greter than he Thenne at myddaye Sybyll loked in the ſonne / and there ſhe ſawe a cercle of golde about the ſonne. Et in medio circuli virgo pulcherrima cum puero). And in the myddes of the cercle a mayden and a chylde in her arme with a crowne of golde. And whan Sybyll had ſhewed this to themperoure / ſhe ſayd to hym. This chylde ſhall be greter than yu arte / or euer were or euer ſhall be. And therfore do hym worſhyp and reuerence. Thenne anone the emperour toke encē
               ſe and dyde worſhyp to hym / and charged all the people too do the ſame / and to call the chylde theyr god / and hym but a man as other were. Thus all cryſten people may lerne to do worſhyppe and ſeruyce to this chylde this day. And therfore the thyrde maſſe this daye is ſayd at myddaye / in tokenynge that cryſten people ſholde come & offre in the worſhyppe of this chylde & his moder. And ſhewe them ſeruaū
               te and ſubgecte vnto hym / And knowelege this gloryous

chylde for her lorde and her god. And eche man ſholde come to hym and not for drede. And therfore the offyce of ye maſſe this daye begynneth thus. Puer natus eſt nobis). A chylde is borne to vs he ſayth and not a man. For al cryſten people ſholde be bolde / and not aferde for to come vnto hym to haue grace / for he is full of grace / and redy to gyue mercy to them that aſke it mekely with due reuerence. He is euer redy to gyue mercy and grace. In tokenȳge that ſame day that Cryſte was borne in bedleem a well of water torned & ranne oyle all that daye ſhewynge that the welle of grace & mercy was borne that daye yt ſholde gyue mercy and grace to all them that wolde come to hym and aſke mercy & grace and that ye ſhall here by enſample.

Then came Gylbert home in to Englonde / & whā this womā ſame her tywe ſhe came after & met in London at ye chirche of Poules / thenne Gylbert made the byſſhop to cryſten her & afterwarde for to wedde theym togyder / and Gylbert gate ſaȳt Thomas on this woman So whan ſhe was with childe / ſhe dremed in a nyght yt ſhe came to ſaynt Poules chirche but / whā ſhe wolde haue gone in / ſhe thoughte her wombe was ſo grete that ſhe myght not in to the chirche by noo waye. Thenne on the morowe ſhe went vnto her confeſſour & tolde hym all the dreme. Thenne ſayd he dame be gladde & thanke god hyghly. For yu haſt a childe in thy body yt all holy chirche ſhal be to lytel to receyue hym. Thenne was ſhe gladde and thā
               ked god hyghly. And ſo ſoone after was this childe born & was called Thomas Thenne by ſpace he wexed a man and ſo he was a man in all degree For he ſerued the kyng manly & ſerued god worthely / & deyed for the lawes of holy chirche mekely. I may well ſaye he ſerued the kyng manly For whan he was made chaūceler of Englonde / this londe was ſo ful of outlondyſſhe men and ſo ſore ouerſette wt theym yt there myght noman go by the waye vnrobbed But in ſhorte tyme after. Thomas with his wyſedome and with his man hode droue them all out of this londe / ſo that all the people myght go faue and vnberobbed / Thomas was alſo

manly in repayrynge of the kynges maners that were lete falle downe & deſtroyed. And in eſpecyall the kȳges palays at London & at Weſtmynſter that was all lete fallen downe. But bytwene Eeſter and Wytſontyde Thomas made to repayre it ayen / for he hadde there ſo many werkmen of dyuerſe craftes that a man ſholde vnnethe here his felowe ſpeke for dōnynges of ſtrokes. He was alſo manly in dedes of armes for there as the kyng hadde many Caſtelles and townes out of his hondes and he ſpente moche good for to gete theym / and ſhedde moche blood for the getȳge of theȳ ayen at the fyrſt & they were holde out of his hondes. Thenne Thomas wt his wyttes and wyſdome gate them ayen Alſo whan he was in the kynges warres of Fraūce / he quyte hym ſo māfully / that whan ye kyng of Englonde had exyled Thomas / the kyng of Fraunce was his chyef helpe & ſocour. Alſo Thomas was as māfull in his araye. for he was clothed in the beſt and rycheſt clothe and furre that myght be founde. And alſo his aparayl his ſadels brydels ſhone as bryght as ony ſyluer / He was alſo manfull in his houſholde for his halle was euery daye in the ſomer ſeaſon ſtrewed wt grene ruſſhes / & in wynter with clene heye for to ſaue the knyghtes clothes that fatte in the floure for defaute of place to ſytte on For there came ſo many euery day to ete of his mete & drynke / for he wolde haue al maner of deȳtyes that myght be founde in this londe. In ſo moche that the kyng hymſelf many tymes vnwarned came to Thomas to mete bothe for loue that he had to Thomas / and alſo to ſee the araye / and alſo the reuell that was in Thomas houſholde / for there ſpake ſo moche people worſhyp to Thomas. And for more truer and alſo better loue that thenne was bytwene the kyng and Thomas whyle it laſte was neuer bytwene two men. Wherfore I put this enſample. ¶It happed that it felle in colde wynter as the kȳg and Thomas came

rydynge togyder in chepe ſyde at London. The kyng was ware of a poore man that was well nere naked / and had no clothes and was ſore a colde Thenne ſayd the kyng to Thomas / it were grete almes dede to gyue to this poore mā better clothes. Syre ſayd Thomas of ſuche ye ſholde take hede. Thenne had Thomas a clothe of gode ſcarlet and well furred with ryche furre. Thenne the kyng layde honde on this clothe & wolde haue pulled it from Thomas for to haue gyue to this poore man / but Thomas helde it faſte. And thus they wraſteled longe. In ſo moche that they were lyke to falle to the grounde / but at the laſt by fauour Thomas ſuffred the kyng to take his clothe of. And thenne the kyng caſt it to the poore man / and badde hym renne awaye faſt & ſelle it / and bye hym other / and yf thou beſette it well thou mayſt fare the better euer whyle thou lyueſt. Thenne Thomas fayned hymſelf wrothe. But in his heete he was well pleſed that his robe was ſo well beſette / Thenne the people merueyled gretely fyrſt what was bytwene the kyng and Thomas. But whan as they ſawe what it meaned / the people were gladde and hadde grete ſporte therof. ¶This I ſaye to ſhewe you exemple how well they loued togyder / thꝰ Thomas ſerued the kyng manfully. Alſo we muſt lerne of our lorde patrone ſaynt Thomas to ſerue god deuoutly For he ſerued god full deuoutely / for as ſoone as he was made archebyſſhop of Caūterbury / anone he torned his lyuynge in to better lyuynge and thought to ſerue the kyng of heuen as well as he had the kyng of this worlde before. And anone he layde awaye ſcarlet and ryche furres / and all ryche a byllementes of clothe of ſylke and were clothe of myddell pryce and caſt awaye ſylke and ſendell. and wered here next his naked and bare body in ſuffrynge grete pouerte / and harde punyſſhement of his fleſſhe that it ſholde not vſurpe his good wyll and in lyke wyſe he made a breche of the ſame

/ in whiche was ſo moche vermyn / that it was an horryble ſyght for to ſe / but this knewe but fewe people. And euery wedneſday and fryday he made his confeſſour to bete hȳ with a rodde vpon his bare body as a chylde is beten in the ſcole. And he vſed euery daye for to waſſhe thre poore mennes fete knelynge on the grounde. And then he gaue to eche of them four pens. And alſo moche more penaunce he vſed in praynge & in wakynge that were to moche to tell at this tyme. Thenne whan Thomas was in the abbay of Pounteney / vpon a daye whan he had ſayd maſſe he kneled downe before the awter in his prayers. Thenne the abbot of the ſame place had to ſpeke with hym / & ſtode vnder a pyler and abode after Thomas / and he ſawe our lorde Iheſu Cryſte appere to Thomas and tolde hym how he ſholde be ſlayne in Caunterbury in his owne chyrche for his ſake / & bad him be ſtedfaſt and holde forthe as he had begon. Thenne came Thomas out of his chapell / and anone the abbot fell doune to the grounde and ſayd. Syr we may blyſſe the tyme and the houre that euer ye were borne / and alſo blyſſed myght ſhe be that bare you for to haue ſuche veſytacyon as I haue herde you haue. Thenne ſayd Thomas. I charge the that thou neuer tell it to no man whyles I am alyue / no more he dyde. But whan Thomas was deed / he tolde it openly too all the people. Thus I may well ſaye that Thomas ſerued our lorde deuoutly. He deyed alſo for the lawe of holy chyrch mekely / for whan he ſawe the kynge begyn to make lawes to ouerſet the holy chyrche and ſuche lawes as wolde haue dyſtroyed the lande. Thenne Thomas put hym ſelfe forth and repreued che kynge of his myſdedes. Thenne was the kynge wrothe and made a parlyament at Northampton / and for that ſaynt Thomas wolde not ſet his ſeale vnto the curſed lawes the whiche the kynge and his ſorye counceyle hadde ordeyned and conſtytued in the realme. Anone they

called hym a traytour to the kȳge and exyled hym out of ye londe Thenne Thomas wente vnto the kyng of Fraunce for ſocour and helpe / and full goodly and mekely he receyued hym and all his clerkes and founde theym almooſt .vii yere all that they behoueden. Thenne grete dyſeaſe and greuaunce Thomas had of the kyng of Englonde / and al he ſuffred mekely And thenne by treatyſe and counſeyll of ye pope and of the kyng of Fraunce / there was made a fynyte loue day bytwene the kyng & Thomas. But whan ye kyng ſholde haue kyſſed Thomas he wolde not / For he ſayd he had made his othe he wolde neuer kyſſe hym. But badde hȳ go home to his chirche boldely. Thenne by the counſeyll of the kyng of Fraunce and byddynge of the pope Thomas came home to Caunterbury / Thenne were there four curſyd knyghtes of lyuynge that thought to haue a grete thanke of ye kyng & made her auowe togyder to ſlee Thomas & ſo on childernaſſe daye almoſt al the nyght they went & came to Thomas halle ſyr Reynold beryſton ſyr Wyllyam tracy ſyr Rycharde breton / & ſyr Hew morley. Then̄e ſyr Reynolde beryſton for he was beſt of kynde. anone ſayd he to Thomas / the kyng yt is beyonde the ſee ſente vs to the & badde yt yu ſholde aſſoyle the byſſhop that yu curſyddeſt. Thenne ſayd Thomas / they be not acurſyd by me / but by the pope / & I may not aſſoyle that he had curſyd. well ſayd Reynold / thē
               ne we ſe thou wylt not doo the kynges byddynge and ſwore a grete othe by the eyen of god thou ſhalt be deed. Thenne cryed the other knyghtes ſlee ſlee / and they went downe to the courte and armed theym. Thenne preſtes and clerkes drewe them to the chirche to Thomas and ſpered the dores to them. but whan Thomas herde the knyghtes armed and wolde come in to the chirche and myght not / he went to the dore and vnbarred it / and toke one of ye knyghtes by the honde and ſayd / it beſemeth not to make a caſtel

of holy chirche and toke theym by the hondes & ſayd / come in my childern in goddes name. Thenne for it was derke yt they myght not ſee nor knowe Thomas they ſayd / where is the traytour. Nay ſayd Thomas no traytour / but arſhebyſſhop. Thēne one ſayd flee for yu art deed / Nay ſayd Thomas I came not to flee but to abyde (Ego pro deo mori paratus ſum et pro defenſione iuſticie & ecclie libertate) I am redy to deye for the loue of god & for the fredom and ryght of holy chirche. Thenne Reynold wt his ſwerdes poynt put of Thomas cappe & ſmote at his heed & cutte of his crowne that it henge by lyke a dyſſhe thenne ſmote ye other at hȳ and ſmote it all of. Thenne felle he downe to the groūde on his knees & elbowes and ſayd God in to thy hondes I put my cauſe and the ryght of holy chirche & ſo deyed. Thenne the thyrde knyght ſmote / and his half ſtroke felle vpon his clerkes arme that helde Thomas croſſe before hym & ſo his ſwerde felle downe to the grounde & brake of ye poynt & he ſayd Gowe hens he is deed. And whan they were atte dore goynge ſyr Robert broke wente ayen and ſette his fote to Thomas neke and thurſt out the brayn vpon the pauymēt Thus for the ryght of holy chirche & the lawe of the londe Thomas toke his deth Then how this martyrdome was knowen in Ihrlm ye ſhall here There was an abbey of mō
               kes in the whiche that ſame daye & the ſame tyme yt Thomas deyed a mōke laye at his deth / then for he was a good holy man of lyuynge / his abbot badde hȳ yf it were not to goddes dyſpleſure whā he were deed he ſholde come ayen & ceſ

               e hȳ how he fared / & ſo whā he was deed he came ayen and tolde his abbot whan he deyed an angell brought hym before god and as he ſtode there / he ſawe a byſſhop come wt a grete company of angelles and other ſayntes and he ſtode before god at his Iugement / and his heed dropped downe

of blood of woundes that he had. Then̄e ſayd our lorde to hȳ / thus it beſemeth a man to come to his lordes courte & anone our lord ſette a crowne on his heed & ſayd thus to hȳ As moche as I haue gyue to Peter & poule / ſo moche Ioye I graunte the And ye monke ſayd here by I knowe well yt this is the greteſt byſſhop in Englonde & is ſlayne for goddes ſake. & wete well that I go to euerlaſtynge blyſſe This tolde ye patryarke of Ihrlm ſoone after that Thomas was deed / ther came in to Englonde after peple to fyght ayenſt he then men.

               GOod frendes ſuche a daye is called newe yeres daye / & is ye fyrſte day of the begynnynge of the newe yere that is comȳ
               ge / and is the laſte daye of the yere that is gone. And therfore this day ye ſhall come to god and holy chyrche to here your dyuyne ſeruyce forth this yere For lyke as a good ſeruaunt that hath a good mayſter maketh his couenaūt but ones / but holdeth forthe from yere to yere / hauynge ful truſte in his mayſter that he wyll for his good ſeruyce gyue hȳ
               
a good rewarde in his grete nede at his laſte ende. In the ſame wyſe goddes ſeruauntes maketh couenaunte with hym but ones / that is at the cryſtenynge at fonte. And there he maketh a couenaunt to be goddes ſeruaunt / hauynge full truſt in god that at his grete nede that is at the daye of domewyll quyte hym for his ſeruyce in euerlaſtynge blyſſe of heuen / and ſoo wyll he doo to all that be good ſeruauntes. Thus this day is called newyeres day. It is alſo called (circumſicio domini). The cyrcumciſyon of our lorde. Alſo this daye is called the newe yeres daye. For this day is the fyrſt daye of the kalender / and the yere gooth moche by the kalē
               der / therfore it is called neweyeres daye. Saynt Auguſtyn ſayth. This day and this nyght hethen people vſe many falſe opynyons / and wytchecraftes / and falſe beleue the whiche be not to tell amonge cryſten people leſt they torne to ye vſe / wherfore ye that be cryſten people be well ware leſt ye be deceyued by ony falſe ſorcerye as by takynge counceyle of a man afore an other in byēge or ſellynge or lenyng / in ye whiche ſome haue dyuers opynyones / and yf they be well ſhryuen they be worthy for to haue grete penaūce for theyr myſbeleue / for that cometh of ye fende and not of god. This daye is called the cyrcumcyſyon of oure lorde. For as holy chyrche telleth this daye he was cyrcumcyſed / and bled his blode for our ſake / for whan the fleſſhe was cut he bled faſt and was full ſore for he was but yonge and tender / and but viii. dayes olde / and therfore he bled the more.

that all his body ranne on reed bloode. The .iiii. tyme was whan he was nayled hāde and fete on the croſſe. The fyfth tyme was whan that Longyus peryſſhed his herte with a ſpere that water and blode came out of his woundes. And thenne they toke vp the croſſe with the body and lyfte it vpon hye / and ſodaynly they lete the croſſe fall downe in to ye mortayſe that all the ſynewes / vaynes / and Ioyntes brake and blode and water came out of euery woūde / this he ſuffred for vs. Thenne ſyth Cryſt was cyrcumcyſed and ſhed his blode thus for vs that was without ſynne / and cyrcumſyſyon is for ſynne remedy & helpe / why wolde he be cyrcū
               cyſed that neuer dyde ſynne. Sctūs auguſtinꝰ dicit propt quattuor cauſas). Saynt Auſtyn ſayth it was for four cauſes. The fyrſt was for to make a ſeeth with the Iewes / for elles they wolde & myght haue ſayd that he had not ben of theyr lawe / wherfore they wolde not receyue hym / nor conſent to his techynge / this was to deceyue ye fende. For ryght as the fende deceyued Adam and Eue / and ſo all mankynde was dampned / ſoo it fel to Cryſte to deceyue the fende / wherethrugh all mankynde myght be ſaued. Thenne whā the fende ſawe that he was cyrcumcyſed as an other chylde he wende that he had taken the penaunce in remedy of orygynall

                had knowen hym verely that he had come to haue bought mankynde / he wolde neuer haue tyſed the Iewes to haue put hym to dethe. The ſeconde cauſe was that our lady was wedded to Ioſeph for to deceyue the fende / for ye fende ſholde wene that Ioſeph had be his fader and not cō
               ceyued of the holy gooſt. The thyrde cauſe why he was cyrcumcyſed / yt was in confermynge the olde lawe in grete cō
               forte to the olde faders that were of the olde teſtament. For and yf he had be cryſtened & not cyrcūcyſed it had ben a grete dyſcomforte to all yt were before thyncarnacyon of Cryſt

The .iiii. cauſe of his cyrcumcyſyon was / for our lorde wyſt well yt there wolde come heretykes after yt wolde haue ſayd yt Cryſt had a body of the erthly fantaſy / & not of fleſſhe and blode as one of vs haue / for a body of the ayre may not blede. And therfore to put away all ſuche erroures Cryſte was cyrcūcyſed & bled in the cuttynge of his fleſſhe. The whiche fleſſhe was cut frome his membre / & an angell brought it after to kynge Charles for the mooſt precyous relyke of the worlde / & for the greteſt worſhyppe yt he coude do therto he brought it to Rome to a chyrch yt is called (Sctā ſctō

The .ii. daye is to thȳke how greuouſly he payneth his moder in his byrth in ſo moche that it is a grete myracle of god yt ſhe may haue her lyfe. The .iiii. daye is to thynke how feble and how wretched he is borne / for all the beeſtes of kynde ſomwhat they can helpe themſelfe / ſaue onely mankynde / he neyther may ne can helpe hymſelfe in no degre but deye anone but yf he haue helpe and ſocoure of other. The .iiii. daye is to thynke in how moche peryl & drede he lyueth / therfore in euery place dethe foloweth hym and is euery daye redy to fall on hȳ what tyme ne where no man knoweth / but onely god hym ſelfe.

And ſo they came to Iheruſalem / that was the chyef cyte of all Iury hopynge that they ſholde here there ſome tydynges where that this childe was borne. But as ſoone as they torned in to ye Cyte of Ihrlm
               ▪ then they loſt ye ſyght of ye ſterre that ladde thē euer ye waye tyll yt they came thyder bryghter than ye ſōne. Then whan they came to ye cyte of Iheruſalē / they tode to kyng Herode / for he was there the ſame tyme and ſayd to hym (Vbi eſt qui natus eſt rex iudeorum) Where is he that is borne kyng of Iewes (Vidimus enim ſtella
                  •

for flaterynge of hym thenne for ony loue that they hadde to hym / Thenne kyng Hetode aſked his clerkis where that this childe ſholde be born And they ſayd / in Bethleem Iude. Thenne kyng Herode aſked the kynges pryuely of the ſterre / and badde them go in Bethleem & worſhyp the chylde and come ayen by hym / and telle hym where he myght fynde the childe / that he myght go and worſhyp hym.

And as it is in many places paynted / the kyng that is it in the myddell for grete Ioye of the ſterre / he loked bacwarde to his felowe behynde hym / and with his fynger ſhewed hym the ſterre / and yt is the cauſe that the myddel kyng loked bacwarde. And thꝰ the ſterre brought theym to Bethleem. And whan the ſterre came ouer that hous there as our lorde was in it ſtode ſtylle. And thenne the kynges lyghred downe and wente

And by the enſence / that he was very god. And by the myrre / that he was very man / and ſholde be deed and layde in graue without rottynge. For as golde is chyef of all metalles. Enſence is brente in holy chirche in the worſhyp of god. Myrre is an oynement that kepeth the bodyes from rotrynge Thus whan the kynges had done theyr offrynge by techynge of the angell (Per aliam viam reuerſi ſunt in regionem ſuam) By an other waye they wente towarde theyr owne londes and left kyng Herode / and the ſterre vanyſſhed awaye from them.

The encence he brente to put awaye the ſtenche of the ſtable there as ſhe laye in And with the myrre our lady anoynted her childe to kepe hym from wormes and dyſeaſe. But what befel of the kynges after I fynde no thynge in certayne. But ſome people haue an opynyon how that ſaynt Thomas of Ynde cryſtened theym whan he came in to that countree of ynde. And thenne as the ſterre lyghtned theym to Cryſtys byrth. ſo the holy ghoſt lyghtned theym in theyr ſoules / and taught theym the parfyght waye of the byleue. and alſo of parfyght and gracyous lyuynge. In ſo moche that they lefte all theyr kyngdome and wente forth on pylgremage. that is to ſaye to Iheruſalem and to many other places. And ſo they came forth to Myllayne / and there they deyed all thre. And ſo after they were tranſlated to Coleyne / and there they be yet. Now ſo haue ye herde by thyſe thre kynges how our lorde Iheſu cryſt was this daye ſhewed very god and man / wherfore lyke they offred with deuocyon. ſo ſholde ye do your offrynges whan ye come to holy chirche / knelynge downe with all the reuerence that ye can or may not on your one knee as to a temporall lorde / but on bothe your knees and doo worſhyp hym with good prayers. Thenne offre ye precyous golde / for there is no golde ſoo precyous as is the good deuote praer / and thenne holde vp your hondes to hym with all the reuerence that ye can / and with a deuoute herte praye to hym and ſhewe hym all the loue of your hertes. And thenne ye offre to hym enſence. For there is no enſence ſauoureth ſo ſwete and gyueth ſo encenſyall an odoure brennynge in the (feyre as

And yf thou do thus thenne thou offreſt knelynge on thy knees / make a croſſe on the erthe and kyſſe it / and thynke well that thou arte but erthe. Thenne muſt ye offre myrre. For ryght as myrre kepeth a body from rotynge / ſo the mynde of dethe kepeth a mannes ſoule from deedly ſynne. In this wyſe do ye your offrynge / and then̄e ſhall ye haue as moche mede as hadde thyſe thre kynges. Alſo he was ſhewed bothe god and man at his cryſtenynge. For he came to the water of Flome Iordane he went to the water and halowed it. For ryght as he was cyrcumcyſed to conferme ye newe lawe / for no nede that he had therto / for he was clene without ſynne / but for to make the ſacrament yt ſhold waſſhe theym / toke cryſtenyng in his name fro all ſynnes. Thenne was Iohan baptyſte redy and moche people with hym that came to the cryſtnynge. Thenne ſayd Iohan too our lorde all quakynge & tremblynge / blyſſed lorde thou art goddes lambe without ſynne / thou haſt no nede to be cryſtned of me / but I that am a man goten and borne in ſynne / hath nede to come and be cryſtned of the in remyſſyon of al ſynnes. Thenne ſayd our lorde Iheſu. Iohan ſuffre at this tyme. For thus we muſt fulfyll al ryghtwyſnes. And Iohn̄ cryſtned our lorde Iheſu cryſt. And as it is credyble / our lady was cryſtned after with other dyſcyples of Cryſt / all the people that were comen thyder. Then whan all were cryſtned / our lorde went out of the water / and as he wente oure of the brynke of the water & all the people with hym. Aperti ſunt celi). Heuen opened and a grete lyght beclypped hȳ in ſyght of all the people. The holy gooſt came downe in lykenes of a whyte douue / and lyghte vpon oure lordes heed.

Ye ſhall beleue that theſe thre perſones be but one god in trynyte / this beleue ye ſhall knowe on the water brȳke / that is in your cryſtnynge at ye fonte. Wherfore he that beleueth thus / and dooth werkes of beleue ſhall be ſaued. Qui crediderit et baptiſatꝰ fuerit ſaluꝰ erit).

And ſuche he auaūceth in euerlaſtynge blyſſe. And therfore the genelogy this nyght begynneth at Iheſu cryſt and gooth vpwardes to Abraham and ſoo to god. Alſo he ſhewed verey god in trynyte whan he tourned water in to wyne at the weddynge. It happened ſo yt the people lacked wyne whyles they were at the meete. Thenne badde oure

            ¶De conuerſione ſancti pauli.
            
               FRendes ſuche a day ye ſhall haue ſaynt Poules daye that is called conuerſyon of ſaynt Poule / for that daye he was conuerted & tourned fro a wycked tyraunt in to goddes ſeruaunt / from an hye man & a proude / in to a meke man and a good man / & frome the dyſcyple of ye deuyll in to goddes holy appoſtle. So for this man was torned from all wyckednes in to grete goodnes / in grete helpe and ſocoure to all holy chyrche. Therfore holdeth his conuerſyon / & ſo do we of no mo / but of hym onely / and that for thre cauſes. The fyrſt for grete myracles in his tornynge / & for the grete Ioye in his defendynge / & for the enſample of his amendȳge. Fyrſt or he was torned he was called Saule / for ryght as Saule ye kynge of Ierlm purſued Dauyd to ſle hȳ. So dyde Saule purſue Cryſte & his dyſcyples to brynge them to dethe. Therfore whyle Cryſt went here in erth this Saule wolde neuer come to here his techȳge. But as ſoone as Cryſt was ſtyed in to heuen / then anone this Saule for he was lerned

& coude the Iewes lawe / he began to withſtande & gayneſayd Cryſtes dyſcyples dyſputynge agaynſt them / & purſued them in all that he myght in full entent to haue dyſtroyed them / & all cryſten faythe. Then on a daye he dyſputed with ſaynt Steuen / & for he myght not ouercome hym / he bethought hym how he myght brynge hym to his dethe / & ſo he lefte hym neuer tyll he was deed. Then it is ye maner of the fendes chyldren whan they haue done a curſed dede for to be glad therof / proude in herte and encreaſe in theyr malyce / ſo was Saule gladde of the dethe of ſaynt Steuen And for he wolde haue goten hym a name of wyckedneſſe paſſynge all his felowes / he went to them yt had the Iewes lawes in kepynge & gate hym a lettre of warraunt to take all yt beleued on Cryſt / & brynge them to Iheruſalem to be put to dethe there. Then whan he had theſe letters he toke ſuche a enuy ther wtin his hert ayenſt cryſtē people yt whā he herde ony man ſpeke of them anone for grete angre he wolde ſneſe at the noſe and frooth at the mouthe for angre: and grynte with his tethe / thretenynge & menacynge towarde them / that all cryſten people were aferde of hym. Than on a daye he herde that in the cyte of Damaſke was moche criſten people hyd for drede / and ſo he rode thederwarde. But anone our lorde Iheſu criſt ſhewed his ſwetenes of his grace whan this Saule was in his hye pryde / & in wyll to haue done mooſt harme. Then aboute myddaye our lorde keſte a grete lyght of grace aboute hym / the whiche was moche bryghter than the ſonne / and the lyght ſayd vnto Saule in this maner of wyſe. (Saule ſaule quid me per ſequeris). Saule ſaule what foloweſt thou me. And anone he was aferde / and fell downe of his hors and cryed and ſayd for grete fere (Quis es tu dn̄e) Lorde what arte thou. Than ſaid our lorde to hym. (Ego ſū ieſus nazarenꝰ. I am Iheſus of nazareth / for yt was ye name of his manhode. Then ſaule

anone byleued in hym and ſayd. Lorde what wylt thou yt I ſhall do. Thenne ſawe the people about hym the lyght & herde the voys / but they ſawe noo thynge / but anone wente to Saule and toke hym vp by the hondes. for he was blȳ
               de and myght not ſee / and ſo ladde hȳ to the Cyte to a good mannes hous. And there he was thre dayes and thre nyghtes faſtynge / and nother ete nor dranke / ne myght not ſee / but euer prayed to god for drede of that vyſyon. The whiche tyme the holy ghooſt taught hym Cryſtis lawe Thenne the thyrde daye one of Cryſtys dyſcyples that hyght Ananyas as god badde hym came to hym full ſore aferde and ſayd (Saule frater. dn̄s Ieſus miſit me ad te qui apparuit tibi in via) Saule the lorde hath ſēte me to the Iheſus that appyered to the in the waye / and that thou ſholdeſt ſee and be cryſtned And whan that Ananyas layde his honde vpon his heed / anone he ſaw clerely / and ther felle from his eyen lyke ſcales of fyſſhes / and whan he hadde cryſtened hym he called hym Poule and thenne ete and was comforted / and had his ſtrenghte / and was there a fewe dayes with ye dyſcyples. Thenne wente he in to the Temple / and preched opēly of our lorde Iheſu cryſte / preuynge clerkely yt he was both god and man / and none other (Stupebant enim omnes qui audiebant et dicebant) Forſothe all they that herde hym were aſtonyed & ſayd / that it was a grete myracle & grace of god of his ſoden conuerſyon. For he that was ſo curſyd of lyuȳge ſo lytell before / was ſo ſoone torned to god and man. Thus may ye here how grete a myracle that god ſhewed in his conuerſyon. And how grete Ioye holy chirche maketh of his defendynge / it was grete Ioye to all cryſten people that was a lytell before beſy to deſtroye cryſten peple anone after as redy to encreaſe cryſten peple And he yt was ſo beſy & gladde to ſhed cryſten mēnes blood Thenne he was as redy to ſhede his owne blood for them And as

beſy as he went to put them to dethe / thenne with as good a wyll he was redy to take the dethe for theym / and there as no man durſt preche the worde of god for hym / after the cō
               forte that they had of hym / they ſpared not for lorde nor for knyght but openly preched the worde of god / & taught the faythe after in euery place. And he that to fore was ſo proude and ſo fyers / & ſoone after was made ſo meke & ſo lowly that he fell to the grounde to euery cryſten mannes fote yt he treſpaced to / & mekely beſought theym of mercy wt a full pacyent herte. Wherfore ſaynt Auſtyn lykeneth hym vnto an vnycorne of kynde that bereth a horne in his browe / and with that horne he ſleeth all the beeſtes that he fyghteth wt Alſo he is ſo fyers of hymſelfe that there may no hunter take hym / but thus they wyll begyle hym. They wyll eſpye where the vnycorne haunteth & vſeth to walke. And there they wyl ſette a mayde. And as ſoone as the vnycorne ſeeth the mayde / anone by kynde he wyll fall downe & laye his hede in her lappe / & thenne all his myght and ſtrength is gone. And thenne they come & take hym Thus he ſayth / that ſaynt Poule was fyrſt ſo fyers in hym ſelfe / that they durſt not preche there as he was ne ſpeke to hym for drede. But whan our lorde Iheſu Cryſt ſhewed to him ſwetenes of his grace / and this fayre mayde that is the lawe of holy chyrch anone Poule fell downe to the grounde and was ſubget to all cryſten people / herfore holy chyrche was gladde of his defendynge. He is ſet alſo in hye enſample of hye amendynge for our lorde is ſoo gracyous that all cryſten people may be ſaued that wyll forſake his myſſe beleue and be conuerted. Multo magis gaudium erit in celo ſuper vno peccatore penitenciam agente quam ſuper nonaginta nouem qui non in digent penitentia) There is more Ioye in heuen vpon one ſynner repentaunt doynge penaunce / than vpon .xcix. that dyde neuer committe ſynne. And therfore our mooſt blyſſed

lorde wolde that al were conuerted / wherfore in hye enſample & conforte to all ſynfull people he ſet ſaynt Poule to loke vpon. For though a man had done neuer ſo moche ſyn̄e and he wolde forſake his ſynne & ſynne no more / thenne all the company of heuen maketh Ioye and melody of his conuercyon / as we do here in erthe of the conuercyon of ſaynt Poule. But there is moche people that loue more ſynne wt luſt & lykynge in this worlde than they loue god. For there be many that neuer wyll leue ſynne / neyther for loue of god ne for the deſyre of the blyſſe of heuen / nor for fere of the fende / nor for drede of the paynes of hell. But ſome ſaye ye god wyll neuer leſe that he hath bought ſo dere with his paſſyon But they that ſay ſo ben not wyſe. God wyll that none were loſte / but beware thou leſe not thy ſelfe. For all the whyle thou loueſt more ſynne than god / and haddeſt leuer to ſerue the fende than god / thou arte cauſe of thyn owne dampnacyon. For whyle thou haſt more wyll to ſerue the fende and be his chylde than goddes chylde thou leſeſt thy ſelfe / & god hath ordeyned fendes to tourmente theym in euerlaſtynge payne. But ſaynt Gregory ſayeth. They that ſhall be dampned begynne theyr penaunce here in this worlde in party / & after theyr dethe cōtynueth for euermore. Wherfore I tell you this enſample.

But now ye ſhal here how this worſhypfull feeſt was fyrſte founde. Somtyme whan the Romayns by grette myght and royall power conquered all the worlde for they had grete domynacyon / they were ſo proude that they forgate her god and made hem dyuerſe goddes after her owne luſte. And ſo amonge all they had a god that they called Mars / that had be tofore a notable knyght in batayll. And ſoo they prayed to hym for helpe / & for they wolde ſpede ye better of this knyght / ye people prayed and dyde grete worſhyp to his moder that was called Februa / after the whiche woman moche people haue opynyon that this moneth that is called. Februarii. Wherfore the ſeconde daye of this moneth is Candelmaſſe daye the Romayns this nyght wolde goo about the Cyte of Rome with torches and candels brenynge in worſhyp of this woman Februa / for hope to haue the more helpe and ſocour of her ſone Mars Thenne was there a pope that was called Sergius and whan he ſawe cryſten people drawe to this fals mawmettry and ventrue byleue. He thought to vndo this foule vſe and cuſtome and tourne it in to goddes worſhyp and our ladyes. And gaf commaundement / that all cryſten people ſholde come to chirche and offre vp a candell brennynge in the worſhyp that they dyde to this woman Februa / and do worſhypp to our lady and to her ſone

our lorde Iheſu cryſte. So that now this feſt is ſolempny galowed thorugh all cryſtendome. And euery cryſten man and woman of couenable age to come to chirche and offre vp her candels as though they were bodely with our lady / hopynge for this reuerence and worſhypp that they do to our lady to haue a grete rewarde in heuen / and of her ſone our lorde Iheſu cryſte / and ſo they may be ſyker and it be done in clene lyf and with good deuocyon. A candell is made of weke and wexe. So was Cryſtys ſoule hydde within the manhode. Alſo the fyre betokeneth the godhede / Alſo it betokeneth our ladyes moderhode and maydenhede / lyght with the fyre of loue. Alſo it betokneth euery cryſten man and woman that doth good dedes with good entente and parfyght loue and charyte to god and to all cryſten people wherfore yf there be ony of you that his candell of charyte be quenched / goo anone and be accorded with his neyghbours and lyght his candell / and then offre it vp for that is goddes wyl And yf ye doo not thus ye ſhal leſe all youre mede and al your meryte in heuen.

Than was ſhe gretely aſtonyed of this gretynge.

For there was in that countre a man that coude moche wytchecraft / & ſo with helpe of fendes he made hymſelf lyke an aungell & came to dyuers maydens & ſayd he was ſent frome god to them on his meſſage / & ſo oft tymes laye with them & dyde them grete velony.

Si vis viuere oſtende michi lignū crucis) Yf thou wylt lyue ſhew me ye croſſe that god deyed vpon / or elles thou ſhalt be brēt and ſo put him to greate diſtreſſe. Thenne he ſawe he muſt nedes telle or deye / & ſayd to them. I beſeche you lede me to the mounte of caluary there as I ſhal byd you. & I ſhall ſhewe you the croſſe of cryſte for he was blynde & myghte not ſee. And ſo whan he was brought to the mon̄t of caluary / & he kneled downe & prayed lōge & whā he had prayed / the place where the croſſe was meued and erthe quoke and there came a ſwete ſauoure fro the place there the croſſe lay yt was as ſwete as ony ſpycery in the worlde / & thēne they dygged there longe & at laſt they fonde there thre croſſes. But then wyſt they not whiche was cryſtes croſſe for thother two And thenne toke they a dede body and layd it on that one croſſe and thenne on ye other & whan it came to criſtes croſſe anone the body roſe to lyf and thanked god thenne ſayd Iudas / thou arte cryſte truly and ſauyoure of the world. & after yt Iudas was cryſtened & was a holy man after. Thenne toke Eleyne a parte of the croſſe & ſent it to rome to her ſone & the remenaūt therof ſhe made to ſhryne it in ſyluer and golde and left it in Iheruſalem with all the worſhyp that ſhe coude. Thus holy chirche maketh mynde this daye that the holy croſſe was founde ¶Thēne as we rede we fynde in a Cyte that was called (Byrectus) a cryſten man hyred a hous of a Iewe to dwell in. ¶Then had this man a rode / the whiche Nychodemus had made in mynde of cryſte. Thenne toke he this rode and ſette it in a priuy place of his hous / for ſyghte of the Iewes and dyde it worſhyppe & honour after his connynge / thenne after it

fell ſo that this man went in to another hous & happed him to leue this rode behynde hym vnwetynge. Thenne came a Iewe & dwelled in the hous there this cryſten man hadde dwelled / thenne for to make hym good chere his neyghboures came on a nyght & ſouped wt hym / and as they ſate at ſouper and ſpake of this cryſten man that dwelled there before this Iewe loked beſyde hȳ / & in a corner he ſawe this rode / & whan he ſawe that anone he began to grynde wt his tethe / & to chyde with this other Iewe his neyghboure / and ſayd yu arte torned to cryſten fayth / & haſt a rode / and dooſt it worſhyp pryuely / then this other Iewe ſware nay as depe as he coude that it was not ſo / ne neuer ſawe it before ye tyme / yet notwithſtandynge that other Iewe went & tolde his neyghboures / and ſayd that this man was a preuy cryſten man and had a rode pryuely in his hous. Thenne anone came all his neyghboures woode for wrathe / & all to bet this man / & drewe hym & tugged hym in the worſte maner that they coude / and ſo at the laſt they ſayd all / this is theymage that yu beleueſt vpon / and they toke the ymage & bete it and ſcourged it / and crowned it with thornes / and at the laſt they made the ſtrengeſt of theym to take a ſpere and wt all his myght to ſmyte it to the herte / & anone therwith blode and water ranne out of the ſydes. Then̄e were they ſore aferde therof & ſayd / take we pottes and fyl them with this blode and bere it to the temple there as all the ſeke people is of dyuers maladyes / and anoynt theym therwith / and yf yt they be hole with the blode / thenne crye we god mercy / and anone lete vs be cryſtened man and woman. Thenne they anoynted the ſeke people with ye ſayd blode and anone they were hole. Thenne wente theſe Iewes vnto the byſſhop of the cyte and tolde to hym all the caſe / and anone he kneled doune on his knees & thanked god of this fayre myracle / & whan he cryſtned the Iewes he to vyoles of glaſſe / cryſtall

and aumber & put of this blood in them & ſent it about in diuerſe chyrches & of this blood as many men vnderſtōde / came to blood of hayles. Mylytes tellyth in hys cronycles / yt many yeres after / yt Iheruſalē was dyſtroyed the Iewes wolde haue buylded it ayene / then as they wente thyderwardes erly in a mornȳge they fonde many croſſes by the waye / & they were aferde therof & tourned homewarde ayene yet on ye morowe they came ayene / then were ye croſſes full of blood & then they fled homwardes agayne eche one / yette wolde they not leue therby / but ayene yt .iii. daye thē fyre roſe out of therth & brēt thē euerychone in to aſſhes

And it is called ſo for he baptyſed cryſte in ye water of flome Iordā. wherfore ye ſhall faſte ye euyn. And ye ſhall vnderſtōde & knowe howe ye euyns were fyrſt foūde in olde tyme in ye begȳnyng of holy chirche. It was ſo that ye peple came to chirche wt cā
               dellys brennynge & wold wake & come with lyghte towarde nyghte to the chyrche in theyr deuocyons / & after they

fell to lecherye / ſonges daūſes / harpynge pypynge & alſo to glotonye & ſynne & ſo torned the holyneſſe to curſedneſſe wherfore holy faders ordeyned the people to leue the wakȳ
               ge & to faſte ye euen / and thꝰ torned ye wakynge in to faſtynge. but it is called (vigilia) that is wakynge in englyſſhe & it is called the euen. For at ye euen they were wōte to come to the chirche. But in worſhyppe of ſaynte Iohan the people waked at home. & made .iii. maner of fyres. One was clene bones and noo woode / & that is called a bone fyre A nother is clene wode & no bones. & that is called a wode fyre / for peple to ſyt & wake therby. The .iii. is made of wode and bones. and it is called ſaynt Iohannis fyre. The fyrſt fyre as a greate clerke Iohan belleth) telleth he was in a certayne coūtrey / ſo in the coūtrey there was ſoo greate hete the whiche cauſed that dragons to go togyder / in tokenynge yt Iohan deyed in brennynge loue & charyte to god & mā. And they that deye in charyte ſhall haue parte of all gode prayers. & they that do not ſhal neuer be ſaued. Then as this dragons flewe in thayre / they ſhed down in to that waters froth of her kynde. & ſoo enuenymed the waters & cauſed moche people to take theyr deth therby and many dyuerſe ſekeneſſe. Then on a tyme there were many greate clerkes and rad of kyng alyſaunder how on a tyme as he ſholde haue a batayle with ye kynge of Iude. And this kynge of Inde broughte with hym many olyphauntis berynge caſtellis of tree on theyr backes as the kynde of thē is to haue armed knyghtes in ye caſtell for the batayle / them ne knewe alyſaundre the kynge of the olyphauntes that they drad no thynge more than the Iarrynge of ſwyne wherfore he made to gader to gyder all ye ſwyne that myghte begoten. and cauſed them to be dryuen as ny the olyphauntes as they myghte well here the Iarrynge of the ſwyne. and thenne they made a pygge to crye. and whan the ſwyne

herde the pygges a none they made a grete Iarrynge / & as ſoone as the olyphauntes herde that / they began to fle eche one / and keſte downe the caſtelles and ſlewe the knyghtes that were in them / and by this meane Alexander had ye vyctory. Alſo theſe wyſe clerkes knoweth well that dragō hate nothynge more than the ſtenche of brennynge bones and therfore they gadered as many as they myghte fynde and brent thē / and ſo with the ſtenche therof they droue away the dragons / & ſo they were brought out of grete dyſeaſe. ¶The ſeconde fyre was made of wood for yt wyll bren̄e lyght & wyl be ſeen ferre. For it is the chefe of fyre to be ſeen ferre / & tokenynge yt ſaynt Iohan was a lanterne of lyght to the people. Alſo the people made blaſes of fyre / for they ſholde be ſeen ferre / & ſpecyally in the nyght. Iheremye the prophete many a yere or Iohan was borne he prophecyed and ſpake thus with goddes mouthe & ſayd. Prius

Thenne for ſaynt Iohan ſholde be holy or he were borne god ſent his angell Gabryell to zachary ſaynt Iohans fader / as he dyde ſacrefyce in ſtede of Abya the byſſhop in the temple / & prayed to god to haue a chylde / for bothe his wyfe and he were barayne & olde. Thenne ſayd thaungell to zachary. Ne time as zacharia. Drede not zachary god hath herde thy prayer. Elyzabeth vxor tua pariet filium & vocabitur nomē eius Iohānes Elyzabeth thy wyfe ſhall haue a chylde & his name ſhall be Iohan / he ſhall be fulfylled with the holy gooſt. Et multi in natiuitate eius gaudebunt). And many ſhall Ioye in the byrthe of hym· Thenne for zacharye was olde / & he prayed to haue a token of his beheſte. Thenne ſayd the aungell too

hym he ſholde be dombe tyll the chylde were borne and ſoo he was. Thenne conceyued Elyzabeth / and whan ſhe was quycke wt chylde our lady came with chylde alſo to ſpeke wt Elyzabeth. And anone as ſhe ſpake to Elyzabeth / ſaynt Iohan plyed in his moders wombe for Ioye of Cryſtes preſē
               ce that he ſaw in our lady. And ſo there our lady was with Elyzabeth vnto the tyme that Iohan was borne / and was mydwyfe to Elyzabeth. and toke ſaynt Iohan from ye erth And whan neyghboures herde that Elyzabeth had a ſone / they were full gladde / and came thyder as the maner was that tyme to gyue the chylde a name / & called it zachary after the fader / but Elyzabeth bad call hym Iohan / but there was none of the kynde of that name. They aſked zarchary by ſygnes what the chylde ſholde hyght. Thenne he wrote to them & bad call hym Iohan / and there with god loſed zacharyes tongue / & he ſpake redyly and thanked god hyghly. Thus was Iohan halowed or he was borne. And for he wolde gyue euery man ſyght of grace and of good lyuynge he gaue them enſample. For as ſoone as he was of couenable aege / he went in to deſerte & was there tyll our lorde came to be cryſtned of hym. And there he lyued full ſtraytely. Iohannis habuit veſtimenta de pilis camillorum). Iohan had his clothynge made of the here of a camell / & a gyrdell about hym of the ſame ſkynne. Eſca autem eius erat locuſta et mel ſilueſtre). Forſothe his mete was leues and honyſocles that hath a whyte floure ye groweth in trees / and he eete all maner of wormes that were nouryſſhed in that deſert amonge herbes: & the wormes be as grete as a mannes fȳger / and ſucked hony of floures that be called honyſocles that poore people gadereth and frye theym in oyle to theyr mete. Alſo Iohan dyde ete brode rounde leues the whiche groweth in that deſerte vpon trees. And ſo whan that they be broken and rubbed bytwene a mannes hondes they be

ſwete as ony hony and dranke water of a welle that was in that deſerte / there was Iohannes lyfe in that deſerte / tyll that our lorde was .xxx. wynter of aege. And thenne our lorde and Iohan met at the water of flome Iordan & thenne Iohan tolde the people of cryſt and ſayd / Ecce agnus dei Se the lambe of god / that I haue tolde you of / that ſhall fulfyll you in the holy ghooſt. ¶Thenne went Iohan in to the water / and there he baptyſed cryſt. And whan he was baptyſed / Ecce aperti ſunt celi / Heuen opened / Et vidit ſpiritum dei diſcendentem ſicut columbā) And he ſawe the holy gooſt come downe as a douue. Et vox de celo dicens And a voyce frome heuen ſpake thus. Ecce filius meus dilectus in quo michi bene complacui). This is my well beloued ſone that pleaſeth me. Here lerned Iohan fyrſt to know ye thre perſones in trynyte / & all this betokeneth two fyres The thyrde fyre of bones betokeneth Iohans martyrdome for his bones were brente / and how ye ſhall here. ¶We rede that kynge Herode had a broder yt hyght Phylyp / and he had a fayre woman to his wyfe / & Herode loued her well and helde her vnder his wyfe wherfore Iohan repreued hȳ and ſayd. Non licet tibi habere vxorem fratris tui). It is not lawfull to the to haue thy broders wyfe / & therfore he put hym in pryſon. And ordeyned betwene hym and his wyfe how Iohan myght be deed without troublynge of ye people / for the comyn people loued Iohan well. Thenne Herode ordeyned to make a grete feeſt to all the ſtates of ye countree / for they ſholde holde with hym / yf people had ryſen. And ſo whan the day wos comen that the feſt ſholde be holden and al the people were ſerued at mete.

But he was gladde in his herte. And thenne ſent in to pryſon to ſmyte of Iohans heed / wt out ony other dome / & was brought to the damoyſel. Then the moder lete bury it in a preuy place ferre frome the body Thenne the nexte nyghte after Iohans dyſcyples came & toke his body and buryed it. And there it lay tyll Iulyan the appoſtata the emperoure came that way thenne he made to take vp Iohans bones & to brenne them / and to caſt the aſſhes in the wynde hopynge that he ſholde neuer ryſe agayne to lyfe. Thus ye may vnderſtande how holy yt this man was? Thenne anone an aungell came from heuen and tolde zacharye of his conceyuynge / And was halowed in his moders wombe / and our lady toke hym fro the erthe in his byrthe and an angell brought his name frome heuen. And after he cryſtned our lorde Iheſu Cryſte / this was an holy man / ye ſhall vnderſtande that ſaynt Iohan theuangelyſt deyed that ſame daye / but holy chyrche maketh no mencyō therof / for his day is holden in Cryſtmas weke. Thenne for theſe two Iohans be holden the worthyeſt ſayntes in heuē Thenne there were two ſcolers of dyuynyte the one loued Iohan baptyſt / and the other Iohan euangelyſt / and on a daye they purpoſed to dyſpute of this mater / and the daye was aſſygned / but thenne the nyght before eyther Iohans appered to theyr amantes / and badde theym leue theyr dyſputacyon for they were well accorded in heuen / and made no ſtryfe ne debate. And thenne on the morowe before all ye people / eyther of theym tolde his vyſyon the whiche were come for to haue herde theyr dyſputacyon. And thenne ail ye people thanked god & both Iohans of this fayt myracle. & alſo there were two meſels the whiche loued theſe two Iohannys

/ and ſoo as they were in comunȳge / they ſpake of thyſe two ſaȳtes / whiche were the gretter in heuē. And ſoo that one ſayde / ye one was gretter than ye other / & ſoo they began to fyghte. Then̄e there came a voyce fro heuen And ſayde / we fyghte not in heuen. And therfore fyght not ye in erth for vs / for we ben in peas. & ſoo be ye. And therwith they were booth hole of theyr ſykeneſſe & thanked god and both ſaȳt Iohannes and afterwarde they were holy men. And therfore lete vs worſhyppe thiſe holy Saȳntes yt they maye praye for vs / yt we may come to heuens blyſſe. Amē.

that ye lete that man go downe that all men may ſe whome they haue worſhypped. Thenne Symon fell downe and al to braſte. Thenne was themperoure wrothe / & made to lede Peter and Poule forthe / and dyde Peter on a croſſe and his heed downewarde / & ſoo put hym to dethe. And Poule for he was a gentylman borne for the more worſhyppe they ſmote of his heed. Thenne the people ſawe aungelles with crownes ſtandynge on the croſſe there as Peter hanged / & whan Poules heed was ſmyte of / there came out fayre plente of mylke and after blode / thenne ye nyght after came cryſten people and layde theyr bodyes togyder in a graue / and there they lay tyll cryſten faythe was more open in Rome.

Thenne came Peter to hym agayne & ſayd / haſt thou take ony fyſſhe to nyght / and he ſayd nay. For I was ſo ſtonyed with lyght & with melody that I myght do no maner thynge. Then̄e ſayd Peter. Mitte rethe in mari). Caſt the nette in to theſe and I wyll helpe the / & ſoo they toke a grete multytude of fyſſhes. Thenne ſayd ſaynt Peter to the fyſſher I am Peter

Thus this curſyd man dyde deſtroye many kyngdomes & ſo bare the holy Croſſe in to his owne countree / Then themperour Eraclius herde therof & was full wroth & ſory / & ſente to this Coſdre to trete wt hym for Eraclius was a cryſten man Then Coſdre anſwered curſedly & ſayd he wolde not treate tyll he had all his peple to forſake cryſtendom & do ſacrefyce to his mawmettes. Then this Emperour Eraclius betoke all to god & gadred hym an ooſt of peple to fyght wt this curſyd kyng Coſdre hopynge to god

to gete the holy Croſſe ayen. But whan this curſyd kyng Coſdre came he fell in ſuche a fantaſye & madneſſe that he toke his ſone al the gouernaūce of his reame & lete make an hous for hymſelf in maner of an awter lyke vnto heuen / & made it all ſhynynge golde & precyous ſtones / & ſet hymſelf in the myddes in a chayr of golde / & commaunded that all the peple ſholde calle hym god / & ſo ſate / & the holy Croſſe in his ryght honde in ſtede of his ſone & on left honde a tame kocke in ſtede of the holy ghoſt & hymſelf in the myddes in ſtede of Trynyte and thus he ſat lyke a madde man Then his ſone herde that Eraclius was comynge / he wente ayenſt hym / & met hym at a grete water ouer the whiche water was a brydge. And then by thaſſent of both theyr ooſtes / that the two chyef captayns a myddes of the brydge ſholde fyght for theym all / and bothe endes of ye brydge ſholde be drawen vp / & whiche of them yt had the vyctory ſholde haue both the kyngdomes. Then was Eraclius ſo full in fayth of the Croſſe & truſted in the prayer of people yt he ouercome his enmye. Then Coſdres peple by ſterynge of the holy ghoſt torned to the fayth by free wyll of themſelf / & whan they were all cryſtened / Then wente Eraclius wt both ooſtes to ye olde kyng Coſdre as he ſatte in his trone & ſayd to hym thus. For by cauſe thou haſt doo worſhyp to the holy Croſſe / thou ſhalt choſe yf thou wylt be cryſtened & haue thy kyngdome ayen for a lytell trybute in reſt & peas / or elles to be deed & he forſoke to be cryſtened. Then anone Eraclius ſmote of his heed & made a crye yt his treſour ſholde be dealed amonge his men / & precyous ſtones & other Iewels ſholde be kepte to reſtore the chirches that were deſtroyed & bare the Croſſe to Ieruſalem. And whan he came to the mount of Olyuete towardes the cyte of Ieruſalem rydynge on a trapped hors / he wolde haue ryden in to ye cyte of Ieruſalem but ſodenly the yates felle togyder

and was a playne wall. Thenne he was gretely aſtonyed & meruayled gretely of that vengeaunce / & made a grete mone. Then̄e came an aungell and ſtode vpon the gates and ſayd. Quando rex noſter. &c). Whan the kynge of heuen came this way & through theſe gates towarde his paſſyon he rode on no trapped hors / nor on no clothe of golde / but mekely on a ſymple aſſe / gyuynge enſample of mekenes to all people / thenne the aungell went his way. Thenne the kynge with all the deuocion yt he coude or myght do / anone dyde of his clothes to his ſhyrte and went bare fote and bare legged. Thenne the gate opened & he went in to the gate of Iheruſalem and ſo in to the temple and offred the croſſe agayne as it was before. And thenne for ye grete Ioye that the people had of this croſſe / & of the grete myracles yt god ſhewed it was the more worſhypped after than it was afore and the worſhyppe of the croſſe that was caſt downe / after was lyft vp / wherfore this daye is called exaltacyon of the holy croſſe. For as ſaynt Auſtyn ſaythe / the croſſe was fyrſt of grete ſpyte and velony. And now it is of grete worſhyppe / ſo that emperoures and kynges worſhyp and do to it grete reuerence.

Thenne he keſt ſo grete loue to Cryſt yt he left all his goodes yt he had & ſued Cryſt forthe full ſymple & full poore. Alſo he fedde Cryſt gladly / for on a daye he

prayed Cryſt to ete wt hym / & made Cryſt a grete feeſt / not with dylycate metes & drynkes / but in fedynge Cryſt & all his company. For he fedde all yt wolde come for cryſtes ſake for moche people ſued Cryſt wherſoeuer he went. Et ſecuti ſūt eū turbe multe).

Then Mathewe anone delyuered theyr nygromancye / ſoo that all the people knewe openly that it was the fendes crafte / wherfore theſe people the whiche dyde beleue on this nygromancy made dragons by the fendes crafte for to ſpyt and degorge flambes of fyre out of theyr mouthes / and brenne ſo that the ſtenche of them ſlewe moche people.

Then deyed her fader and there came a kynge yt was called Hertagus whiche loued this mayden Eufegeme / & prayed Mathewe to helpe hym that he might haue her. then ſayd Mathewe yt myght not be / for ſhe was wedded to the kynge of heuen & myght not breke that ſpouſehede. Then was Hertageus wrothe & badde ſlee Mathewe. And ſo as he ſtode & ſayd maſſe at ye auter / there came one behynde hym & ſlewe hym / & the cryſten people buryed the body in the ſame chirche. Then bad ye kynge to ſette fyre in Eufegemes hous / & that on euery ſyde for to brenne her therin. Then Mathewe appered to her and badde her be of good chere / & anone torned the fyre frō her hous in to the kynges palays / and lefte there nothyng ſaue the kynge and a yonge chylde with hym / and the kynge was ſmyten with meſelry ſo foule / that he for grete payne & wo ſlewe hymſelfe.

For bycauſe that Mathew wrote mooſt of Cryſtes manhede / therfore he is lykened to a man. And Luke wrote mooſt of Cryſtes ſacryfyce and his dethe / therfore he is lykened to an oxe / for an oxe was offred in ſacryfyce of the olde lawe / in tokenynge that Cryſt ſholde be offred for ſynne of people in ſacryfyce in the auter of the croſſe.

And whan Luke had lerned this perfyghtly / then he loked what Marke & mathew had wryten. And ſo toke at them / & there as they wrote obſcurly or derkly / he wrote more playnly / & openly all thynge. And thus in prechynge / and in techynge he offred his worde vnto god. ¶And alſo he offred his dede vnto god in ſacrafyce. For he payned hym ſelfe with dyuerſe penaunce of faſtynge / and alſoo of harde lyuynge and in

The fyrſte ſacrament is batptȳ in whiche orygynall ſynne that we be borne in / & all other ſynnes that we be defoyled with they ben waſſhen awaye thrugh the paſſyon of criſte / & ther with is betaken vs the fayth & byleue of holy chirche / wythoute whyche there maye noo man be ſaued. Therfore it is cōmaunded that euery cryſtē woman that feleth her quycke with chyld / to kepe her frome heuyng & ſhouynge / grete trauayle & fallynge & other myſcheues yt ſholde myſcheue the chyldes lyfe / and ſoo be loſte body and ſoule.

Alſo the mydwyf and tho yt be aboute the chylde. yf it be in peryll of deth / ſholde cryſten it on this wyſe. I cryſten the in the name of the fader & of the ſone and of the holy gooſt. And thenne ſprynge the chyld with water and that thou forgete not thyſe wordes. I cryſten the / and yf it be cryſtened in this maner atte home. It ſhall not be criſtened eftſone at chirche. For that were a grete peryll as to nayle god eftſones vpon the croſſe. And yf it lyue after this cryſtenyng at home / brynge it to the chyrche / and there it ſhall haue all the hole ſeruyce that it lackethe. In tyme of peryll of dethe fader & moder maye cryſten theyr owne chyldren without

harmynge of theyr ſpouſchode. Godfaders & godmoders ben borowes tofore god for theyr god chylderen / and therfor they ben bounde to teche theym to loue ryghtwyſnes / charyte / and chaſtyte / to kepe theym frome deedly ſynne and ſpecyally to teche theym the Commaundementes & bylyue. A man and his wyfe ſholde not holde it atones to a chylde at the fontſtoon / ne them that fongyth to it / there ſhall not fonge to it atte the confermynge but atte nede. Fader ne moder / ne noryſe ne none other ſholde ſuffre noo yonge chylde by theym at bedde whyle they ſlepe / ne preſſe theym faſte in cradell / ne ſuffre theym lye ſlepynge ne wakynge withoute a keper. There is gooſtly kynrede / throughe fongynge of chyldern atte the fontſtoon on .ix. wyſes. One is betwene the chylde and the godfader. Another betwene the chylderen of the godfaders. Another by ye chylde and the wyfe of the godfaders fleſhely knowen tofore. A nother betwyx the godfader and the fader of hym that is cryſtened. A nother betwix the preeſt and the chylde that is baptyſed. A nother betwix the chylde and the chylderen of hym that baptyſeth. A nother betwix hym that baptyſeth and the wyfe of hym that baptyſed fyrſte I knowe. A nother bytwene the baptyſer and the moder of hym that is baptyſed. There ben alſo .ix. afore the byſſhoppe atte the cō

The ſeconde ſacramente is confyrmacyon of the byſſhop / this is a maner of a noyntynge in the forhede by the hondes of the byſſhop / wherby the holy gooſt gyueth ſtrength agaynſte the feblenes of ſynne of our forne fader with a marke impreſſed to the ſoule / wherby thou ſhalte knowlege the fayth and loue of cryſte To this euery cryſten man and woman be bounde to brynge theyr chylderen as ſoone as they may namely

or they be a yere of age. For they ſhall haue the more grace of lyfe / and the more blyſſe in dede. And thoſe that be not confermed mow not receyue none other ſacramente. Nother they ſhal not waſhe hede nor forhede thre dayes after for the reuerence of that holy oyle. The thyrde ſacramente is ſhryfte of penaunce / to ye whiche euery man and woman is bounde anone as they can reſonable wytte atte .xii. yere / euery yere clene to be ſhryuen onys atte the leeſt atte theyr owne curate / that theſe may euery daye ſee of all the ſynnes that euer they dyden or can thynke vpon / that whan they loke on theym / they may haue more ſhame and drede in theyr hertes of theyr ſynne / where thrughe by the grace of god they mow leue theyr ſynne / yet notwythſtondynge that ye ben bounde ouer a yere to ſhewe youre ſhryfte to youre owne curate / and yf there ben ony of you that haue more affeccyon to a nother than to me / lette me wete to whome and where / and he ſhall haue ryght good leue and cryſtes blyſſynge and myne. So that he do it not in no deceyte of his owne ſoule / as to hyde his ſynne fro me / to that entente he myghte the lenger abyde therein / as ſome done / and haue done many yeres. For I knowe more of theyr counſeylle than they wene that I do / or wolde I dyde. Suche be lyke thadder yt hydeth his venyme in preuy places / or he wolde engender with the lamprey and after he tourneth & taketh it vp ayene. Thus ſome of you ones a yere or ye come to youre curate / ye caſte oute venym of youre ſynne atte pardons and other preuy places / and anone after Eeſter ye take it vp ayen. As thefte / auoutry / and ſuche other / and ben worſe after than ye were afore / ye that this done begyle your ſelfe / & nede grete penaunce. Had Iudas whā he betrayed cryſt tolde his ſynne to his true herdman as he dyd to Cayphas & pylate whā he ſayd I haue ſȳned

in body betrayenge ryghtwyſe blode he hadde be ſaued. For they toke none hede therto / but ſayd / what is yt to vs / auyſe the as who ſayth they haue no cure of the. Ryght ſoo thus I trowe. & ſome of you went to your owne herdeman whā ye go to other / thenne ſholde brybery / ſtolen goodes / and ſuche other be reſtored. And auoutry and other curſed ſynnes be thus dyſtroyed. I ſay not this for no deſyre that I haue to here your ſhryft / for it is but a payne to me / ſaue for charge that I haue of your ſoules. For I had leuer mynyſter al the ſacramentes yt longeth to myn offyce forty tymes than that ones. But I doo it for too dyſtroye the falſe ſubtylte yt ye vſe in ſhryfte agaynſt the helthe of your ſoules / & ſo god helpe me. Alſo whan thou comeſt to ſhryft / thou ſhalt come with grete ſorowe of herte / and mekely knele too the preeſt as to hym that is in goddes ſtede / and tell hym holy how yu haſt myſgouerned thy lyfe / & be in full wyll to do ſo no more / and hertely do thy penaunce enioyned the therfore / and e
                     •
                  les it is no ſhryfte. But many there be that ſet nought by theyr penaunce doynge / ſo that they haue tolde theyr ſyn̄e to the preeſt and ſuche begyle themſelfe / for the veray ſacrament of ſhryfte dependeth ſpecyally in thre thynges wtout whiche thou mayſt not truely be ſhryuen. And yt is ſorowe of herte / ſhryft of mouthe / and penaūce doynge / for though thou be ſorye for thy ſynne / and ſhryue the not it auayleth not a ſeth ne do thy penaunce it auayleth not. For wyte wel thou mayſte / yf thou ſholdeſt reken with a man and at the ende of thy rekenynge thoughe thou were .xx. lib. in his det Ryght ſo thou ſhryueſt the & makeſt rekenynge wt the preeſt in goddes ſtede / but thou make a ſeeth therfore / & paye thy det with penaūce doynge it is nought / for it is a token that thou arte not ſory for thy ſynne / and yf thou be not ſory therfore as I haue ſayd tofore thy ſhryft is nought / and ſo thou ſynneſt agaynſt the holy gooſt whiche is ye mooſt peryllous

ſynne that is. Therfore yf thou wylte haue the blyſſe of heuen do thy penaunce / and thenne thou ſhalte haue grace and pardon of thy ſynnes / for in theſe thre wordes contrycion / confeſſyon / and ſaryſfaccyon ſtandeth all the vertue of pardon in this worlde. Our lady ſaynt Mary in the vyſyons of that holy woman ſaynt Byrgyt / telleth whan pardon prouffyteth / and whan not / ſaynge that he yt cometh to pardon / & hath wyll after to leue ſynne / and to reſtore that he hath wrongfully taken / not wyllynge to wynne a penny after with wronge ne falſhede nor to lyue ony daye lenger than god wolde he dyde. In proſperyte & aduerſyte to ſubmytte his wyll to goddes wyll / to flee worſhyp and frendſhyppe of this worlde / he ſhall haue pardon & remyſſyon of ſynne / and is lyke to the aungell of god in the ſyght of god. But he ſayth he that vyſyteth her for remyſſyon & pardon of ſynnes / and hath no wyll to leue his olde vanytees / ne ye Inordynate affeccyon / but kepeth ſtyll his wronge getynges / falſe deceyte and ſubtyltees / and alſo loueth the world in hym ſelfe and other / and wyll flee ſhrewde cuſtomes / ne reſtrenyne his fleſſhe from ſuperfluytees. Ryght nought auayleth hym pardon ne Indulgence. And with this accordeth ſaynt Gregory where he ſayth thus. Thou makeſt neuer ſatyſfaccyon for thy ſynne ſayth he / but yf thou feere of thy ſynne. Euery body that wyll deſyre pardon / but fewe or none wyll do that they ſholde haue pardon for / but thrugh truſt and coloure of that pardon they do many a curſed dede / & doo ſynne on truſt therof other ony good deed / it is a grete ſynne of pryde / for be yu neuer ſo full of good vertues / vnkyndenes to thy god may dyſtroy all thoſe vertues. More vnkyndenes thou mayſt not ſhewe thenne for to dyſpleaſe god wylfully / therfore fle ſuche vnkyndenes / and thynke that the more acceptable that thou arte to god through thy good lyuynge the more culpable thou ſhalte be / yf yu retorne

agayne to ſynne. It is a ſlypper hope ſayth ſaynt Auſtyn whan a man ſynneth vpon truſt to be ſaued. He that dooth ſo he neyther dredeth ne loueth god. So that it is more profytable to holde thy ſelf feble and lowe than to be holde ſtrō
                  ge / and for feblenes fal and be loſt / therfore take hede what goodnes god putteth in the. And thanke hym / & praye him of contynuaunce and do no ſynne vpon truſt of pardon / ne of ony other good dedes. The fourthe is the holy ſacramēt of the aulter / the whiche is cryſtes owne body / his fleſſhe & blode in forme of breed / the ſame that was borne of the vyrgyn Mary / and done on the rode / this is made through the vertue of goddes wordes of ye preeſt that hath power / whiche power neyther aungell ne archaungell had / but onely man in mynde of hymſelfe. This ſacrament is euery man & woman bounde by the lawe ones a yere as at eeſter / yf he be .xiiii. yeres of aege / & haue dyſcrecyon to receyue it / whā they ben with ſhryft and penaunce made clene of theyr ſynnes / and elles to be put out of the chyrche / and of cryſten buryelles / but yf it be for ſykeneſſe / or for ſome other reaſonable cauſe / whiche cauſe he muſt certyfye his curate of. For he that vnworthely receyueth this ſacrament he receyueth his dampnacyon. Alſo as often as ony man ſeeth that body at maſſe / or borne about to the ſeke / he ſhal knele doune deuoutely and ſaye his pater noſter / or ſome other good prayer in worſhyppe of his ſouerayne lorde. Alſo ye ſhall vnderſtande that the drynke the whiche ye doo receyue in the chalyce after your howſel is no ſacrament but it is water for to brȳ
                  ge the lyghtlyer the holy ſacramente in to thy body. But in fourme of breed it is hole our ſauyoure Iheſu cryſtes body bothe in fleſſhe and blode. Therfore thou ſhalte take it in as hole and as entyere as thou mayſt / leeſt ony parte of it abyde and ſtycke in thy tethe. For in the leeſt parte of the hooſt is hole the mooſt precyous body of our lorde / that day thou

hereſt thy maſſe / god graunteth thy nedefull and lawfull thynges / that daye ydle othes and forgoten ſynnes ben for gyuen / that day thou ſhalt not leſe thyn eyen ſyght / ne deye in ſodayne dethe / ne the tyme of the maſſe thou ſhalte not waxe aeged / euery ſteppe thyderwarde & homewarde / an aungell ſhall reken. Lewde men and women to dyſpute of this ſacrament are vtterly forboden / for it is ynough vnto them to beleue as holy chyrche techeth theym. ¶The fyfth ſacrament is anoyntynge of ſeke men / the whiche oyle halowed of the byſſhop and mynyſtred by preeſtes to them that ben of lawfull aege / in grete peryll of dethe. In lyghtnes & abatynge of theyr ſykenes / yf god wyll that they lyue. And in forgyuynge of theyr venyall ſynnes / and releaſynge of theyr payne yf they ſhal deye. So that this ſacrament may be gyuen as ofte as nedeth to euery man and woman that ben in poynte of dethe The .vi. ſacrament is holy ordres / yt no man may take but at his owne wyl. This gyueth power to them that taketh it to ſerue in holy chyrche after ſtate is as to hym that taketh the ordre of preeſthode / for to make the ſacrament of Cryſtes fleſſhe & his blode / and for to mynyſter other ſacramentes too the people. Theſe muſt haue theyr crownes ſhauen / theyr hedes tonſured / and theyr clothes honeſtly ſhapen as falleth to theyr eſtate / and namely in holy chyrche.

The fyrſte is for the couetyſe yt thou haſt to wynne and to dyſpoyle thy felawe. Another is for the grete vſury .xii. for .ix or double or quyte.

For confeſſyon alſo ſheweth out your hertes afore the preeſt by open ſpeche of mouthe. And for ſatyſfaccyon do ye worthy fruytes of penaunce: Thus by theſe thre thynges this hooly ſacrament of penaunce is preued. For confeſſyon alſo as it is ſayd in the ſawter.

molyfye / ne the horryble paynes of helle may feere / ne the Ioyes of heuen may ſuſteyne. Ne that temporall tourmentes ne ſorow may chaſtyſe. Many one there is that can not be contryte in that they do not knowe what contrycyon is. ¶Therfore ye ſhall vnderſtande that contrycyon is an inwarde ſorowe of thy ſoule fourmed by grace / the whiche cometh of forthynkynge of ſynne / and drede of the hyghe Iugement / with a ſtedfaſt purpoſe to be confeſſed / and to doo ſatyſfaccyon after the commaundement of the chyrche.

As whā thy herte is touched with the handes of god / by Inſpyracyon to make the perfyte ſorowfull / but ſomwhat or leſſe in as moche as thou begynneſt to tourne. This is called attrycyon. But whan wyl and deſyre of ſynne in euery parte is fully forſaken with full ſorowe of herte thenne it is contrycion And ſo veray contrycyon is the ſerche of ſynne. ¶Orygen ſayth alſo / that verey contrycyon is for to abhorre and loth all gaye and ſuperfluous araye / and too deſyre the hygher wepynge / and fle ſlaughter to ſpeke fewe wordes / and for to werke ryghtfully.

For the more that thou loueſt a thynge / the more is thy ſorowe whan thou dooſtle ſe it. ¶Aboue all creatures is god to be loued. Thenne it is mooſt ſorowe of his loſſe than of all other creatures whā yu commytteſt deedly ſynne / thenne thou leſeſt thy god. Therore by grete contrycyon and ſorow thou muſt gete hym agayne. For loke how moch thou haſt of grace as ſayth ſaynt Gregory / ſo moche thou muſt haue of ſorowe for thy ſynnes ¶The ſoules that are in blyſſe they may haue no contrycyon / by cauſe theyr Ioyes ben replete wyth plenteuouſnes of glory. They that ben in hell maketh ſorowe / but that

ſorowe is not fourmede with grace. ¶The ſoules in purgatorye hathe ſorowe fourmed wyth grace. yet it is not merytory / in as moche as it ſholde haue be hadde here. Thus in this lyfe mercy oonly helpeth / but after not. It is blamefully herde ſaythe ſaynt Iherome. that can wepe the deth of his frende or the harme of temporel loos. & can not wepe and be ſory for ſynne. Thy contrycyon therfore muſte be ſharpe in that. that thou haſt offended thy heuenly fader that bodely and gooſtly fedyth the in many wyſes. and yet muſte thou be ſharp / in that that thou haſte offendede thy lorde Iheſu goddis ſone of heuen / that with his precyous blood and with hys mercy delyuered the frome the bondes of ſynne crueltee offendes. and byternes of the paynes of hell. And though our lorde ſayde to the. Not euery man that ſayth lord lord ſhall entre the kyngdom of heuen / yet leue hym not but haue hym to the tauerne of contrycyon. and ſaye to hym as Dauyd dyde. The meke and the contryte herte Lorde thou ſhalte not dyſpyſe. ¶And then he ſhall gyue the grace here / and Ioye whan thou gooſt hens. The fawcon whan he hath taken his praye he deſyreth no more therof but the herte and there with he is cōtence. So our lorde Iheſu whan he had raunſoned vs out of helle he deſyreth noo more but a meke and a contryte herte of vs. Therfore as the fauconer or he wyll gyue the herte to his fawcon fyrſt he wyll kytte it. and thenne take out the blood and waſſhe it. So muſte thou gyue thy herte to oure lorde. Fyrſte kytte it wyth the knyf of contrycyon. ¶And thenne take out the blood of ſynne by confeſſyon. and after waſſhe with ſatyſſfaccyon / and ſo with the knyfe of his paſſyō kytte your hertes and not your clothes hauynge in mynde that the blaade of his knyfe was made of the ſpere hede and nayles / that his precyous body and herte were thrylled withalle / The hafte was made of the holy tre of the croſſe

Then wt the cordes that he was bounde with to the pyler. Now bȳ

And I doubte not be thy herte neuer ſo harde / and thou this faythfully prȳte in thy mynde his paſſyon with thy harde herte / it wyll begynne to breke. Thus mayſt thou lerne too ſuffre repreues for oure lorde Iheſu whiche for the ſuffred theſe and many more. ¶There ben .vi. thynges that ſholde ſtere the to grete ſorowe for thy ſynnes. ¶The fyrſt is that ſomtyme of ye daye or nyght as I ſayd before / bethynke the how thou haſt lyued / and whan thy ſynnes come to thy mynde / haue an inwarde ſorowe and remorſe that thou haſt ſo greuouſly offē

Seneca ſayth though I wyſt yt my ſone ſholde be vnknowen bothe to god and man / yet wolde I abhorre and lothe the fylthe of my ſynne. The fourthe is that thou haue drede of the daye of dome / and of the paynes of hell. Of this day ſpeketh ſaynt Peter / vnneth the ryghtwyſe man ye daye ſhall be ſaued ſayth he. Where ſhall thenne the ſynnefull man aperethe whiche breketh dayly the heſtes and preceptes of our lorde. As often and as many tymes as I do beholde ye

I quake in all my herte / & whyder I ete or drynke / or elles ony other thynges do / euer me thynke that the trompe of god ſowneth in myn eeres / and byddeth me ſynnefull wretche aryſe and come to the dome The fyfth is that thou haue ſorowe for the loſſe of heuen / & the grete offence doone to thy maker. The ſyxte that thou haue a thre folde hope. Fyrſt of forgyuenes that thy ſynnes ben alone forgyuen the.. Hope alſo of grace to do good werkes / and in them alwayes to encreaſe. And thenne hope of blyſſe / wherwith thou mayſt afterwarde be rewarded for thy good werkes / the prophete ſayd before yt I ſholde waſſhe euery nyght my bedde with teeres. By this it ſemeth ye cōtrycyon after forgyuenes ſholde be cōtynuall. To knowe this it is harde / yet in thy wyl thou mayſt haue contynuall contrycyon / euer in full purpoſe too leue / and too lothe thy ſynne and thus it is nedefull. For as a confeſſoure knewe ſuche one that cometh ſo contynually beynge ſory inwarde and outwarde / he nedeth neuer to gyue hym but lytell penaunce. For though he had doone grete and horryble ſyn̄e he myght ſo venge and bewayle his ſynnes here / that after his dethe he ſholde no payne ſuffre in purgatory / yet this ſorowe muſt be meſurable with a truſty hope that thou falle not in to heuynes of dyſpayre. It muſt alſo be generall and hole for all ſyn̄es yet more ſharper for one than for an other after the gretenes is / and it muſt be doone for the offence done too god / and not onely for drede of euerlaſtynge payne. This maner of contrycyon breketh the ſnares and the chaynes of the deuyll. And releaſeth the bondes and oblygacyons of euerlaſtynge payne and tourment / and delyuereth the frome the ſeruage and horryble company of deuylles / and maketh the chylde of almyghty god / and heyre of the blyſſe of heuen / the whiche tofore were the chyldren of the deuyll / and brennynge bronde of the perfounde pyt of hell.

Onely contrycyon alſo auayleth not / but there as confeſſyon and ſatyſfaccōn may be hadde. For as we offende god in thre maner of wyſe. In herte / ſpeche and dede / ſoo it nedeth that we do our ſatyſfaccyon in thre maners and elles the ſynne is not forgyuen. Onely contrycion may auayle alſo whan thou arte very contryte / and purpoſeſt afterwarde to abſtayne the from all maner of ſȳne.

Prayer is a louȳge deſyre and appetyte of thy ſoule vnto our lorde god / with ſpeche

of mouth / or gaderynge of wordes / to aſke good of god wt vtterynge of thy voys. Of foure frutefull prayers ſaynte Poule ſpeketh whan he ſayth. I pray you fyrſt of all thynges that there be obſecracyons / oryſon / poſtulacyons / and yeldynge thankynges. ¶Obſecracyons are whan yu ſeeſt in thy ſoule the multytude of thy ſynne / and lytell of thy merytes. And ſeeſte the horryble paynes of helle / whiche thou mayſte not voyde by thyne owne vertue. Ne durſt not for thyne owne vnworthyneſſe make thy prayer thy ſelfe but makeſt ſupplycacyons by other meanes. As whan thou ſayſt Sancta maria ora pro nobis. Oure lorde by thy paſſyon delyuer vs. ¶Oryſon is whan thou haſt forſake thy ſynne and aſkeſte forgyueneſſe by open ſpeche. Poſtulacyon is whan after thy penaunce done thou haſte a ſadde hope of forgyueneſſe yf thou pray alſo ony thynge agaynſte thyne owne ſpede. as Poule that prayed / that his temtacyons myght be putte awaye. Thenne oure lorde wyll not graū

And ſome thynges withoute condycyon / to haue grace and blyſſe with oure blyſſed Iheſu Cryſt / that thou mayſt axe withoute condycyon. ſaynt Bernarde ſaych that thou mayſte aſke of oure lorde god grace in all goodneſſe to pleaſe hym / lyue in hym / ſee his blyſſe / and to able thy ſelf to vertues too doo hym worſhyppe.

And thou muſte conſyder alſo how worthy thou arte that prayeſt and how worthy he is that thou prayeſte for. Thou muſte alſo be clene in ſoule. And yf thy prayer be ſhorte lette it be done with ſtedfaſte hope for a ſhorte prayer with a ſadde hope faythefully done / is more acceptable to god / than a longe prayer

feyntely done without hope / yet to them that ben occupyed in dyuyne ſeruyce longe prayer is ſpedefull. To prayer alſo with voys is more ſpedefull / then to thynke or to worſhyp. Gryſoſtome ſayth thus.) Thou yt with loude voys prayeſt and whyſpereſt / thou ſuffereſte none other to praye aboute the. ¶And therfore thy ſynne and thy payne is encreaſed yf it be done wyttyngely. ¶And thy ſelfe not herde of god It muſte alſo be done without interrupcyon not to ſaye a verſe or a pater noſter / and bytwene Iangle and telle a tale without grete nedē / ne to haſte it to moche. Thou muſte alſoo make it comyn to place / tyme and perſones. Poule ſayth) I wyll that men praye in euery place / yet in the chirche pryncypally. For oure lorde Iheſu Cryſte ſayth) Myn houſe ſhall be called the hous of prayer / all tymes are tymes of prayer / yet in holy chirche ben ſeuē hours ſpecyally ordeyned for tyme of prayer / whiche mooſt ſpecially longen to relygyous men. Oure lorde afore his paſſyon trauayled all nyghte in prayer. Oure blyſſed lady and Ioſeph alſo roſe euery nyght atte mydnyghte and ſayd the pſalmes of cō

In that it is more acceptable to god more pleaſynge to aungelys / and more confuſyon to the deuyll. ¶And the ſame that thou makeſte for a nother / is better than that thou makeſt for thy ſelfe / and thoughe that oure blyſſed lorde Iheſu Cryſte here not thy prayer anone atte thy wyll / yet he hereth it and graunteth the haply that that is more ſpedefull. A thynge that is longe deſyred / atte the laſte it cometh / and that is the more deynte.) It muſte alſo be done with a grete deuocyon. ¶Deuocyon as the clerkes ſaye) is a tenderneſſe of herte / wherby thou brekeſt lyghtely in to teeres. And alſo a wyll of loue lyfte vp to god

or to his heuenly creatures / menynge the inwarde and outwarde to the ſeruyce of thy lorde god Iheſu Cryſte Suche deuocyon purgyth bothe boody and ſoule. ¶And thus deuocyon may be knowen by two pryncypall tokens. One is by gretneſſe of the voys outwarde / as a grete fyre is knowen by the flamme. Another by teeres / for ryght as fyre dryueth oute moyſtoure fro wete woode / ſo deuocyon bryngeth oute teeres of thyne eyen in prayers. ¶Well is hym that hath ſuche plente of teeres. ¶For he is dyſpoſed to grace. But there ben ſome that haue grete plente of teeres fro daye to daye in prayer deuoutely redynge or ſpekynge / and yet wyll not leue theyr wycked ſynne nor trauayle to withſtonde theyr temptacyons / nor to knowe / ne too kepe the preceptes of oure blyſſed lorde Iheſu Cryſte / ) Suche teeres ben not accepte. For dewe ſacrefyce to oure blyſſed lorde Iheſu Cryſte / for and yf that thou be full contryte ſayth Aldrede / and truſte faythfully in the mercy of God truely confeſſed / and wyllynge to doo thy penaunce / and not in wyll to retourne agayne to thy olde) ſynne. Thenne ſayth he ſuche teeres pleaſen god. And waſſhen awaye thy ſynnes and more tormente the deuyll as ſayth Saynt Bernarde. Thenne all other kyndes of tormentes may doo. Syth deuocyon muſt be in euery prayer / yet the tyme therof ſholde be pryncypally vſed in the tyme of the maſſe and for foure cauſes. One is for the preſence of oure lorde god that is there / not oonely by his godhede / but alſo by his manhode that he tooke for the loue of mannes ſoule. ¶The ſeconde is for the multytude of aungellys that be euermore preſente to yelde worſhyppe to almyghty god. ¶The thyrde is for the grete prouffyte / and ſpede that the bodye and ſoule haue / by vertue of the holy ſacramente / bothe to theym that ben preſent. And ſpecyally vnto theym that worthyly and in clene lyfe dooth receyue hym. ¶The fourth is for ye
                  
wonderfull worſhyp that is there gyuen to man / that thorughe the vertue of wordes ſayde of man / the preſence of oure lorde is hadde / and the Innumerable nombre of aungellys / ſoo many that no tounge can telle / nor herte thynke. ¶Deuocyon ſholde be alſo vſed in tyme of ſeruyce that thou arte bonde to ſaye. But for vnkunnynge ſay theyre ſeruyce the more haſtely / for theyr preuy prayer that they hauen deuocyon to. And the deuocyon is lytell or noughte worthe. Se therfore now howe they ſoule maye be refourmed / and broughte ayene to god. Thy ſoule hathe mynde reaſon and wylle Mynde for it ſholde reſte in god. Reaſon for thou ſholdeſte know god / & wyll for thou ſholdeſt loue god. But by ſynne thy mynde is vnſtable / thy reaſon blynde and thy wyll crowked. ¶And all is for thou forſakeſte thy god. ¶The reformacyon therfore of thy mynde is to brynge ayene thy herte that was trauayled wyth vayne / thoughtes / by prayer / redynge and oft thynkynge vpon god As of his Incarnacyon / paſſyon / Innumerable bene faytes / and gracyous gyftes / hauynge greate ſorowe for thy vnkyndnes that thou alwaye ſheweſt hym. The reformacyon of thy reaſon is to by leue ſadly in the fayth of holy chyrche our lorde for our greate comforte hath gyue vs knowlege in holy ſcrypture / where we maye fynde all that is neceſſarye and ſpedfull to our ſoule hele / not to folowe herin oure naturall wyll but to ſubmytte our wytte to the rules of fayth after the vnderſtondynge of holy doctours / and ſoo gooſtly to be clenſed by the ſacrament of penaunce. ¶The reformacyon of thy wyll alſo it is to withſtonde vyces And wyth a good wyll truely and faythfully encreace and abyde in vertues for god withoute ony curyoſyte of wyl. that there be noo double deſyre ne no affeccyon pleſynge to the but ſuche as is accordynge to the wyll of god.❀ ¶Thus than conſydered the worthynes of thy ſoule The
