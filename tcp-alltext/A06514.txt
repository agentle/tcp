O Lorde in what reuerence had the Jewes their Miniſters? How were they prouided for? Likewiſe in the

primitiue Chriſtian churche how were they adourned with reuerēce and liuinges as is yet too be ſeene? yea the very Heathen and Infidelles had their miniſters in eſtimation and prouided for thē, and ſhal we now that proffes ſo much chriſtianity ſeek by all meanes to ouer throwe and bring to nothing our miniſters? the Miniſter being contemned: his preaching ſhalbe little eſtemed. This is the way to ouerthrow the wurd of God, and bring vs too brutalitie, for where preaching ceaſſeth the people periſhe, as ſaith Salomō. But ſome wil obiect and ſay, that riches corrupteth the Miniſters and hindreth their vocation and that they become couetous and more careful then any other, and that a poore eſtate is beſt for them. I anſwere that my meaning is not to enriche any greedy

or couetous Miniſter, but wiſhe 
                  •
               hat when any ſuche ſpringeth vp

                  •
               is were prouided in that behalfe for to ſuppreſſe and keep backe the greedy deſire of ſuche. And my deſire is that thoſe Pariſhes where reaſonable liuinges and ſtipendꝭ were appointed by good men, in time paſt for a Miniſter: might be reduced and brought againe to the right vſe, & that Miniſter or Paſtor, whiche would not continew and be reſident amonge his flock: ſhould be depriued and haue no lyuing there. Hoſpitality is incident to preching, & the Paſtor muſt aſwel feed their belies as their ſoulꝭ, or els hee ſhall doo but litle good among a number. But ſuche as intende to bring the Miniſtery to ſlauery, by thruſting themſelues into their liuinges: I truſt our merciful

and louing God, wil preuent them and cut them of, from their wicked purpoſes and take mercy of his people. But now me thinke I heare the enemies of true religion the Papiſtes ſay, theſe plagues are come vpon vs for your new lerning. I anſwere, in the time of Papiſtry, yea when popery was moſt hieſt had ye no plagnes? Read Polichronicon and ye ſhall finde that theſe be but trifels, in reſpecte of thoſe peſtilencis, yea ſome that felt within this lx. yeere. And I pray you had ye no War in thoſe daies? Read ſence Cxx. yeers and ſee what ſlaughter, what ciuil diſcordes with hunger and penurye happened,

The plague hath long beene there among them, I beleeue verely and dare affirme, that God is as dilygently ſerued, and his wurd as ſincerely preached and obeyed as euer was in this realme, (of a good numbre there) But as the holy Ghoſte ſaieth. Judgement beginneth at the houſe of GOD. God dooth vſe moſte commonly to beginne with his owne houſe, but after that he ſcoureth his enmies, and as our ſauioure Chriſte ſaied, by thoſe vpon whome the towre of Silo fel. Suppoſe ye (ſaith he) that thoſe were greater ſinners then the other? I ſay nay, but except ye repent ye ſhall like wiſe periſhe. So may I ſay. Suppoſe ye that Lō

                  IT is a thing certains and moſte true, (whether man geueth credit therto or not) that there cannot bee in a man a greter torment or vnquietnes more miſerable then the euilles with in himſelfe, whiche be ſo many & ſo great, aboue that he dooth either feel or perceiue. For if he did taſte or feel them: he ſhould feel Hel. For in a certaine maner, a man hath Hel within himſelfe. The queſtion is, how or by what meanes, the Prophet ſaith all men are liars? and again. The liuing man is but vanity. Now to bee a liar and vaine: is to be void of the trueth, and of the perfyt ſubſtaūce. And to be without trueth and perfection: is to be without God and to be loſt. And what is that but to bee in Hel and dampned? And for

this cauſe God doothe chaſtiſe vs benignly and meekly, diſcouering vnto vs the leaſt euils, and chargeth vs but with the lighteſt, knowing that if he brought a man to the full knoweledge of his ſinne and euil: he ſhould periſhe in a moment, and to ſum he permitteth and geueth to feele it. Of whom it is ſaid. He leadeth to hel, and bringeth out again. Wherfore theſe whiche call corporall tribulation a certain aduertiſement of the inward euil, ſay well. And the apoſtle to the Hebrues calleth them Fatherly corrections of God, ſeeing he chaſtiſeth all the children that he receineth and doothe this to thend, yt by his louing corrections of light euils: he putteth back the great and he

                   euels, and then thou ſhalt raſte leſſe of the ſencible euil.

Now we ſee by this, how cruel they be againſt them ſelues, to whom it is geuen to contemplate the weight of their ſin and euilles, and how little they doo eſteeme all yt they may ſuffer in this life, yt they might not feele their own hell. So ſhould it be to eche of vs if he felt or if he gaue firm credite to his inward euelles: he would gladly deſire with a good wyll ſū outward euils or greefe he ſhould ſo vexe him ſelfe in them, and would neuer be ſo ſad: as when he felt not ſum outward euel, as we haue know en that holy men haue doone, and

Now theſe thingꝭ be not preſently felt to be euell: but becauſe that the long vſage and the continuaunce hath cauſed that we make no counte of them, and the thingꝭ whiche happen verye ſeldome dooth more ſtur vs vp, ſo that this is trew, that we do ſcantly feele the thouſand part of our owne euelles. And finally that the euilles bee meſured, felt, and not felt, not after the meaſure of the fact, but by opinion and affection.

Let vs wel remember our ſelues how many Meditations haue bene made, how many meanes hath bene inuented, how many bookꝭ compoſed, how many remedyes ſerched for to returne man from his ſinne to rendre the worlde contemptible, to moderate the paſſions and euelles & to comfort the afflicted, neuertheleſſe of neceſſity death once muſt come. Theris no man, whiche deſireth not

rather to ſuffer (if it might bee) all theſe euils & mo ſorowes & miſeryes, to auoid death. The ſaintes feared death. Jeſus Chriſte him ſelfe, had it in ſuche horror that his ſoule was heauy, yea ſo heauy that droppes of bloud, dropped from his moſte holy body, inſomuche that our good and merciful God ſheweth that there is no euill in the whiche is more neede to comfort the feble and weak then in this euil, as is to be ſeen heereafter. As now all theſe thingꝭ, be common too all men, as be alſo the benifites of helth, commen in the ſame euilles to them. Moreouer the chriſtians haue a new and needful cauſe to haue in horrour and too feare the euel to come, the whiche neuertheleſſe dooth ſurmount all the euelles afore ſaid, whiche is that ſaint Paul deſeribeth in the. 10. Chapiter of the. 1. to the Corinthians, ſaying. He that ſtandeth: let him take heed that hee fall not. The way is helding and

the path ſlippery, our enemy is ſo puiſſaunt, yea armed with our owne proper force and ſtrength, that is to ſay, with our own fleſhe and with all oure wicked affections, garniſhed with a numbre of worldly armures, hauing the voluptnous delites and pleſures on the righthand: and many wicked willes and deſires on the left hand, beſide wicked carnall concupiſcence with the whiche he is garniſhed, and he hauing ſuche boldnes to noy, to deceiue, and deſtroy vs in a thouſand ſacions and waies. We liue ſo that we be not aſſured of our good purpoſes nor ententes, not the minute of an houre. Saint Ciprian reciteth many like thinges in his booke of mortality, and ſhe with that we muſt think vpon death, as that that commeth ſudenly to diſpatche theſe euelles. Now this commeth cuſtomably to thoſe that conſider diligently in their mindes, theſe infinit daungers of hell, hauing their hartes

firm & conſtant. We ſe that often times, they deſire to be loſed out of this priſon of the body, deſpiſing life and death, that is to ſay, all theſe aforeſaid euilles, to the ende to bee deliuered from this burden of ſinne, in the whiche they be in, as wee haue ſaid in the firſt ſpeculation, and into whiche they may fall into, where of wee wil heerafter ſpeake. And ſo theſe two reaſons be moſte true, not onely to deſire the death: but alſo to diſpiſe all the euils, and more ſtrōgly to beare eaſely one only euel. If the Lord doth ſo graciouſly moue any man: as it is verely a gift of God to be moued with theſe thinges, for he that is a right Chriſtian, dooth not onely deſire to be ſick: but alſo to dy, ſeeing him ſelf, and feeling to be in ſinne, when he is in helth, and alſo ſeeing him ſelf at euery houre ready too fall into greater and a greater number of euilles and ſinnes, and to do without ceaſſing thingꝭ contrary

               ¶ The third Chapiter or third conſideration whiche is the euel paſſed▪ or behinde vs.
               
                  IN this euell ſhineth mōſte excellently, and aboue the others, the great bountifulnes

& mercy of God our father, mighty to comfort vs in all our anguithes and ſorowes. For there is not one of vs all, that ſhall feele the hand of God more preſently vpon him: then when he calleth to memory the yeeres of his life paſt. Saint Auguſtine ſaith, if the choice were geuen to a man, to dy or to returne againe, to his firſt life, he would rather chooſe the death, ſeeing ſo many euilles and ſo great daungers, that he hath paſſed, and with how great difficulty, and pain. The whiche ſentence is true if it be well conſidered. For as we may ſe heere, how often times that man without his own endeuour, without any care, yea with out and againſt his own deſire, hath doone and ſuffred many thinges of whiche if he had taken councell before they were done, or that he did take councel, that after the wurk being finiſhed, he was conſtrained and abaſſhed in him ſelfe, and to ſay. Too

what purpoſe are theſe thinges happened to me? or how are they come to paſſe, contrary to my entent and thought? or that I haue purpoſed far other wiſe. So that this prouerbe is true. Man purpoſeth and God diſpoſeth. That is to ſay, he dooth it otherwiſe, and clean contrary to that mā hath purpoſed. So that if we had but onely this to beholde: we can not deny but our operations, oure life and our actes to be gouerned by the counſaile and bountifull puiſſaunce of God, & not by our owne prudence. Heer wee may ſee how often times God hath bene wt vs, when we ſaw him not, nor felt him, and how veritable it is that Saīt Peter hath ſaid. That the mercifull God hath care for vs all. Wherefore if wee had nother bookes nor preaching, yet our owne liues caried and led thorow ſo many euelles and daungers: would ſhew vs ſufficiently the deuine bountifulnes of God is very neer vs, as

though he had borne and kept vs, in his boſome without our deliberation and without any feeling of vs in any thingꝭ, as ſaith Moiſes in Deuteronominū. 32 Chap. The Lord hath maī
                  teined and defended him, as the apple of an eye. Hee hath led him ouer all, and borne him vpon his ſhoulders. And frō thence commeth theſe exhortations whiche be conteined in the Pſalmes. I haue remembred the daies paſt. I haue meditatid all thy woorkes, and I haue thought vpon the woorkes of thy handes. I doo remembre all the meruailes whiche haue beene from the beginning. I haue bene mindefull of thy iudgementꝭ and haue bene comforted.
               Now theſe thingꝭ and all other like tend to this end, that we may know this, that God hathe bene euen then preſent with vs, when we thought not of him, and ſpecially when it ſemed he was abſent from vs, for hee

that hathe receiued vs into his protection without vs, yea in ſo many neceſſities, yea in ſmall thingꝭ, and yet while it ſeemed that he had forſaken and left vs, neuertheles he hath not throwen vs of, as it is ſaid in Eſay. I haue forſaken thee for a litle time, but I will gather thee againe in my great mercy. And let vs ioyn this to it. Who is it that hath had care for vs, in ſo many nightes while wee haue ſlept? Who hath cared for vs ſo oftē and ſo many times, as we haue felt our ſelues greeued, when wee wandred about in our owne folies, and haue doone numbers of thinges, in the whiche wee haue not had reſpect to our ſelues? or ſince what time haue we had care, or taking charge of our ſelues? When the auaritius man is in care and ſtudy, to gather great heapes of mony, hee dooth diligently and earneſtly ſtudy and care to ſeek and heap vp together. Alſo ſeeing, how all our care, wil wee or

nil we, retorneth to God onely, and that we be ſcarſly at any time left to our owne councelles. And yet God dooth this onely to inſtruct vs and to learne vs to reknowledge his great bountifulnes, and that ſometime we may vnderſtand how great difference there is betweene his care and oures. By this meanes it happeneth that ſumtime he permitteth that we be aſſailed with ſome light euil, making as though he cared not for vs, but truely there is neither day night nor houre, but he careth for vs, not withſtanding yet he letteth and ſtoppeth, that all the euelles whiche bee neere vs, come not all at once, to tempt vs and proue vs as his deere and welbeloued Children, to learne vs to commit all our care to him, and to call to remembraunce, our life paſt, and conſidre how muche our care and ſtudy is vnprofitable and impuiſſaunt. What doo we profit, or what may we profit our ſelues in all

               ¶ The fourth. Chapiter. of the fourth conſideration whiche is the euel or miſery vnder vs.
               
                  HEtherto we haue ſeene no other thing in all the euilles and miſeries whiche we ſuffer: but the goodnes of God is ſo fauourable and ſo great, that among ſo many euelles with the whiche we be enuironed in this worlde, and be wholy empriſoned in the ſame, yea they bee ſcarcely permitted to aſſail vs very ſeldome, ſo that what ſoeuer euel or miſery it be, whiche dooth preſently aſſail vs: yet neuertheles it is an aduertiſement of a certaine great gain or great goodnes yt God wil honour vs with all, when hee dooth not ſuffer that we be oppreſſed with

the multitude of euels, in the whiche we be in. For what a benefite is it of God, that when one is tempted with a number of miſeries and troubles, and yet is ſcant touched with one? Yea it is meruail, that he is not hurt of all, yea and a grace that he is not ſtricken and ouercome vtterly.
               The firſt euel that is vnder vs is death, the ſecōd is hel. For if we conſider the horrible death of others, by the whiche the wicked bee puniſhed: we ſhall ſee eaſely what a gaine and benefite it is not to ſuffer that wee haue wel merited and deſerued. For how many be there whiche be ſtrangled on the gallowes? drowned in the water? or whiche haue their heddes cut of, whiche parauenture haue cōmitted leſſe offences then wee? So that the Sonne of God himſelf dooth propoſe and paint forth their death and ignominy, before our eyes, as in a glaſſe, in the whiche we may beholde that wee haue iuſtly deſerued.

for he ſaith in the .13. of Saint Lake after that they had ſpoken to him of certaine Galileaus, whoſe blood Pylat mengled with ye ſacrifices. Think you (ſaith hee) that thoſe Galileans were greater ſinners then the other, becauſe they ſuffred theſe thingꝭ? I ſay not ſo, but I ſay to you, that if ye repent not: ye ſhall all like wiſe periſhe. As alſo he ſpake of the .18. men vpon whome the toure of Silo fell, and ſlew thē. Think ye (ſaith he) that theſe ſame were more culpable then all the inhabiters of Iheruſalem? I ſay not ſo, but if ye repent not I tell you, that ye ſhall all peariſh. For let vs not think that lighter euelles and plagues be dew to vs, when we doo commit ſinnes greater and more abhominable? or at the leaſt the like ſinnes. And the trueth of God ſhall not be vntrue, and his iuſtice ſhall not be vnrightwiſe becauſe of vs, yt whiche hath diſpoſed to rendre to euery one according to his wurks, if we doo not

preuent our ſelues, or at the leaſt it

                  ntly to ſuffer ſmall and light euell and troubles. Yea how many thouſandes be there in hel, and in eternal damnation, which parauenture had not the thouſand part of our ſinnes?
               How many yung wenches, and yung boyes, and thoſe whiche wee call innocentes? How many Munkꝭ Friers, Hermittes, Preeſtes, maried folks, which ſeemed to ſerue God all their liues longe, and parauenture be damned, for leſſe offences then we haue doone? Let vs not diſſemble heerein. There is but one iuſtice of God, for all offences and ſinnes. He hateth and condemneth egally ſinne, in whome ſoeuer he findetk it. Doo we not ſee heere, the ineſtimable bountifulnes of God and great mercy, the whiche hath not damned vs, ſo greatly, ſo many, and ſo often times, as we haue deſerued? I pray you what great thing is it, that wee

may ſuffer in all our life, in reſpect of the eternall paine whiche they ſuffer and namely haue not deſerued, but for lighter offences, & yet yt not withſtanding, wee be free and preſerued from ſo many euelles and miſeries, the whiche God ſeemeth not to ſee? Now when we doo lightly paſſe ouer the benefites of God, or that wee doo not wurthely eſteeme them: it is a villain ingratitude and an inſencible hardneſſe of hart, and incredulitie.
               Moreouer heere muſt we bring in How many Infidelles? How many Jewes, Gentils, Painims, and how many of their infantes to whome if the thinges had bene geuen, that bee geuen to vs: they had not bene in hel but in heauen, and had leſſe offended if it be lawful ſo to ſay? Jeſus Chriſt himſelf ſetteth before our eyes this mirrour in Saint Mathew, ſaying. Wo be to thee Bethſaida, wo be to thee Corazim, for if yu bertnes, which haue bene doone in you, had bene

doon in Tire and Sidon: they had repented long agone, in ſacke and aſſhes. Neuertheles I ſay to you, that in the day of iudgement it ſhalbe ca

We ſee then what thankes and louing praiſes, we owe to our good God, in what ſoeuer miſery or euel yt may come to vs in this life, for ſcarſely there commeth not one droppe of the euilles that we haue meritid, the whiche Job, compareth to the ſand of the ſea.

                  HEere let vs ſet before our eyes, the great numbre of the wicked aduerſaries, and conſider firſt in them how many euelles, miſeries, and ſhreud turnes they would haue doone vnto vs, and yet haue not, neither to our bodies, goodes, renoum, nor our ſoules, the whiche they would haue doone but that the permiſſion of God would not ſuffer them. And the greater that one hathe his eſtate ſpred forth, and ſet in hy degree: ſomuche the more is hee ſubiect to eſcarmiſſhes, conſpirations, deceiptes, detractions, and temptations of ennemies, ſo that in all thinges we may know and perceiue, the preſent hand of God, and his fauourable kindnes toward vs. Is it then meruail, if we be then ſumtime ſtriken and ſcourged with one of theſe euelles? Alſo

let vs conſider theyr euell purpoſe and ententes, and lament and pitie them, for they bee commonly geuen 
                     •
                  p, and ſubiect to all euelles, euen as

And theſe euelles that we doo ſuffer, is nothing in cōpariſon of that they be in. In ſin, infidelity, vnder the wrath of God, vnder the powre of the deuil, bond ſlaues, accurſed, ful of iniquity & ſin, ſo that if all ye world ſhould curſe them, it could not be ſaid, to be more execrable & horrible, whiche if we cō
                  ſider well all theſe thingꝭ as apperteineth: we ſhall ſee by and by, how great is the benignitie of God, we ſufferīg a certain little incommodity or euel of our bodies, beeing in faith in ye kingdome of Jeſꝰ Chriſte, vnder ye moſte bleſſed yoke of God, yt which

incommodity we can not ſcacely perceiue, ſo great is the abundaunts of the true good thingꝭ. But the chriſtian and faithfull hart, ought to bee moued and greeued with the miſſery of others, eſteeming their anguiſhes to be his own. For as Saint Paul, in the .2. to the Phillippians, commaundith vs to doo likewiſe ſaying. Let none of you looke vpon the thinges that bee his owne, but of others. Let ther be ſuche affection in you as was in Jeſus Chriſte, whiche although he were in the forme of God: neuertheles hath taken the ſhape of a ſeruaunt. &c. That is to ſay, with moſte humble affection, hee hathe clothed him ſelf, with our ſhape, none other wiſe behauing him ſelf in our euels, then as they had been his owne proper, ſo forſaking and forgetting him ſelf, and his glory, that he was formed wholy to be a perfect man, ſeaſed and taken with our euelles. The faithful ſaintes, beeing taken with

this affectiō and ſtirred vp with this conſideration: haue accuſtomably praied, namely for the euellꝭ of their enemyes, and to doo all thinges after

                  drely touched and mooued with theſ: thoughtꝭ? Becauſe that the eye of our hart is not pure enough, wherewith wee ſhould ſee how great the miſery and ignomini of man is, being wrap ped vnder ſin, that is to ſay, ſeperated and alienatid from God, and poſſeſſed with the deuel. For what man is he, that hath his hart ſo hardened, that dooth not conceiue a certaine horror in beholding the hideous figures of theſe whiche ſit & ly at the churche doores and other open places hauing the face ſcabbed and eaten halfe of, their noſes quite eaten of, the eyes tornout, and other members moſte horribly conſumed of filthy rottennes, ſo that it is an horror to the body and minde, to heare them ſpeak, and to the eye, to be holde ſuche a fearfull & greuous ſpectakle? Now what dooth God declare by theſe pitifull monſters, 
                     •
                  utto open the eyes of our vnderſtāding

to thend yt we may ſe how much more horrible the figure of the ſoule of the ſinner, ſhe with his filthy rottennes, and his ſtinking corruption, yea although he liue in delightes and pleaſure, clothed brauely in ſ

                  k and purple, couered with chaines of golde, among roſes, baulmes and ſweet ſmelles as the Sonne of Paradice? But what ſoeuer he be, beeing a ſinner of this world: he is cōpared to one of theſe rotten ones. Verely theſe infinite euelles aſwel in multitude as in greatnes, beeing deſpiſed in others: maketh that our owne euil beeing but ſmall, to ſeeme to vs moſte great, and that there is almoſte none other ſinne but our own.
               But yet it cōmeth to paſſe that they bee in muche worſe condicion then we, namely in corporall euellꝭ. For what thinges (I pray you) may be to them pleaſaunt and delectable, allthough they haue, and obtaine all that they will, theire conſcience not

beeing in tranquility and reſt? Is there an euel more terrible then the tumult of a cōſcience full of remorſe and ſorow? For Eſay ſaith, in the 57. Chapiter. The wicked be as a raging ſea ye whiche can not reſt throwing out his fome and ſand with terrible noiſe, there is no peace to the ſinners, ſaith the Lord God. We may ſee in them that whiche is ſpoken in the .28. Chap. of Deuteronomium.
               The Lorde ſhall geue thee a trembling hart, vnſeing eyes, and a ſoule conſumed with ſorow, and thy life ſhall be hanging before thee. Thou ſhalt fear day and night, & ſhalt not truſt to thine own life. Thou ſhalt ſay in the morning, who ſhall bring me the euening? and in the euening who ſhall geue me the morning? and that becauſe of the feare of thy hart, for the whiche thou ſhalt be aſtonied becauſe of the thinges that thou ſeeiſt before thine eyes. Breefly if any might ſe the the euilles and ſorowes

of the wicked, with ſuche affection as appertaineth, be it of freends or enemies not onely he ſhould forget his owne: but it ſhould ſeem to him that he felt nothing. But with this hee ſhould be moued with an ardent deſire with Moyſes, and Saint Paule, deſtring if it were poſſible to dy for them, and to be ſcraped out of the booke of life, and to bee alienated frō Chriſte, as it is ſaid in the .9. to the Romaines. To the end that they might be deliuered. For Jeſus Chriſte burning with ſuche a deſire, is deade for vs, and is deſcended into hell, leauing vs an example to the end that we ſhould be careful for the euelles of others, and of their paſſionnes, forgetting our owne and deſiring to vnburden them.
            
            
               ¶ The ſixt Chapiter of the ſixt conſideration of the euel or miſery on the right hand.

Reſiſt the deuell, being ſtrong in faith, knowing that the ſame afflictions are accompliſhed in your brethern that be in the world. Alſo the Churche praieth in their prayer, ordinarely that we beeing prouoked by the example of the ſaintes might folow the vertue of their paſſions, this is that they ſing. How many tormentes haue the ſaintes ſuffered to the death, that they might come aſſuredly to the glorious crowne of martirdome? By theſe canticles the churche willeth vs otherwiſe to vnderſtand then to celebrate the feaſts and memories of ſaintes, or to build them temples, aulters or Images.
               But after their example we ſhould be incyted and mooued to ſuffer the

like euelles and tormentes that they haue ſuffred. This was vſed ſūtimes vntil the ſuperſtition of man had peruerted and turned all theſe thingꝭ to Idolatry. For if we honour them wt temples, aulters and Images: wee may rightly be called ſuperſtitious, as now in theſe daies, wee ſee many whiche deck there Images and aulters and celebrate their feaſtes & frequent their temples. And I pray you why doo they theſe thīgꝭ, but becauſe they wil not ſuffer the perſecution whiche the ſaintes by their example and memory, haue ſhewed to be ſuffred? But in dooing theſe thinges what deſire they otherwiſe, but the contrary of that they ſhould deſire? that is to be made vnlike to them, to whom they celebrate the feaſt, for 
                     •
                  e apoſtle to the Hebrues in the .12. Chapiter, treatith very wel this paſſage of conſolation among other ſaying. Ye haue not yet reſiſted to bludſheding, repugning againſt ſinne,

and haue forgotten the conſolation whiche ſpekith vnto you, as vnto children, ſaying. My ſonne deſpiſe not the chaſtening of the Lorde, neither faint when thou art corrected of him, for whom the Lorde loueth: he chaſtsneth, and ſcourgeth euery childe yt hee receiueth. If ye ſuffer correction: God offrith him ſelf to you as to his children. For what childe is it whom the Father correcteth not? for if ye be without chaſtiſement of the whiche all are partakers: then are ye baſtardes and not ſonnes. Moreouer. We haue had to chaſtice vs, our carnall Fathers, and haue ſufferid thē, ſhall not wee rather ſuffer our heauenly Father, that we may liue? But this correction for the preſent, ſemeth not to be ioyoꝰ, but rather ſorowful, but afterward it bringeth a quiet frute of rightuouſnes to thoſe that be exerciſed therein. Theſe be the wurdes of the Apoſtle. Who wil not be aſtonied at theſe wurdꝭ of the Apoſtle?

wherby he declareth openly that thoſe whiche bee not corrected and chaſtiſed of God: bee not the children of God. But to be more ſtrongly comforted in this text, let vs conſider that thoſe whiche bee chaſtyſed by the hand of God, be his welbeloued and dear children, and that they be garniſhed and armed with the cō
                  munion of all the faithful ſaintꝭ and that it is not they alone that doo ſuffer. And truly this meditation, ſhall moderate our paines and torment in our correction. But heere let vs not trouble our ſelues, in that one dooth ſuffer thinges leſſe greeuous & the other more hard, for temptation is geuen to euery man by meaſure, and not aboue his ſtrength, as it is ſaid in the .79. Pſalme. Thou haſt fed vs with the bread of teares, and haſt geuen vs to drink, of teares by meaſure. Saint Paule ſaith alſo.
               God is faithful whiche permitteth not, that ye bee temptid and afflicted

aboue your ſtrength: but ſhall deliuer you in your temptations, that ye may ſuffer and beare it, and in that ye one dooth feele or taſte moſte greef, there hath hee moſte frute and help of God, in ſuche wiſe, that it ſhould ſee me rather to bee an inequality of paſſions, then otherwiſe.
               For Saint John Baptiſt (whiche was miſerably beheaded by Herod) may it not make vs all aſtonied, that ſuche a great & excellent perſonage as hath not beene one emong thoſe that are borne of women ſo great, the ſinguler freend of ye ſpouſe chriſt, forerunner of the Sonne of God, greter then all the Prophettes, neuertheles was not put to death, by publike ſentence: nor is not accuſed of malice or enuy, as was Jeſꝰ Chriſte nor yet becauſe of the people, but for the loue of a dauncer, the daughter of an adultereſſe and in priſon, this ſhamefull death of this holy perſon and his life taken away ſo vilainly

               This holy prophet and wurthy man is periſhed as though it had bene vnknowē to God, to man & to all other creatures. What ſuffer we wherin we may reioice (or more aptly too ſpeak) wherein wee be not confounded, if wee make compariſon of our ſuffringes with his death? Wel now where ſhall wee become if wee w

after their death, as it is ſaid by Jeremy. Beholde theſe that are not condemned to drink of the cup, doo drink thereof, and ſhalt than continew Innocent? Thou ſhalt not continew Innocent, except yu drink therof Wee rede of a certain Hermite that complained (whiche had bene ſick almoſte all his life) felt him ſelf wel one yeere to gether: hee was greatly troublid and ſorowful in his minde, and complained that GOD had vtterly forgotten him, and had refuſed to geue him his grace. Somuche is neceſſary vnto helth the correction of the Lord to all Chriſtians. Now we may ſee, that it whiche we ſuffer is leſſe then nothing, if we conſider the Priſons, Manacles, Irons, Fyer, wilde beaſtes and other infinite number of tormentes, that the Saintes haue ſufferid.

hath writtē all that ought to be written, and the memory of the ſame is recommended to the churche, where it is ſaid. Set me for a ſigne in thy hart, & as a butte or mark vpon thine arme. The blood of the lamb ſprinklid vpon the entre of the houſes, ſtaied the aungel frō ſtriking. And likewiſe the ſpouſe is praiſed, becauſe her heares bee as the purple of the king, that is to ſay, her meditation is redde by the remembraunce of Jeſus Chriſt. This is the wood that Moiſes caſt by commaundement into the waters of marah, that is to ſay. Into the bitter paſſions, and were made ſweet. There is nothing but this paſſion, that can make ſweet, yt is to ſay death, as ſaith the eſpouſe. His lippꝭ be as ye diſtilling lilly, drawing out ſoueraigne mirrhe, ye whiche proporcion of lillies and tippes, ſignify the act of miſticall thinges. For as ye lilly is white & the lippꝭ red, that is ye wurdꝭ of the Lord Jeſꝰ be moſte white & moſte pure in ye whiche is no

bitternes, nor bloody ſlaughter, but ſweetnes & pleſauntnes from whom diſtilleth ſoueraine mirrhe: theſe lippes moſte pure, & moſte ſweete haue powre to put away the great bitternes of death, and to conuert it into ſweetnes, puritie, whitenes & ſweet ſauour, as the excellent mirrhe putteth away all ſtinckingnes of ſinne, that is to ſay. When we heare that Jeſus Chriſte the ſonne of God, hath clenſed and ſanctified by his moſte holy ſuffringes, all perſecutions and paſſions, yea the very death, he hath bleſſed the curſe, hee hath glorified ye ſhame and ignomini, and inriched the pouerty, ſo that death is conſtrained to be the gate of life, the curſe is conſtrained to bee cauſe of bleſſing, and the ignomini mother of glory. Now how can wee be ſo ingrate and vnthankful, that we doo not earneſtly deſire, yea and loue all theſe paſſiōs and afflictions, dipped and ſanctified by the moſte pure fleſh and moſte holy blood of the Son of God, the whiche

be made to vs moſte helthful bleſſinges. For if by the touching of his moſte pure fleſh, hee hath ſanctifyed all the waters to be holy and needful to baptiſme: yea all creatures, how muche more hath he ſanctified by baptiſm of ye ſpirit, or of blood, all death, all paſſions, all iniuries, all outragies, all maledictions, all ignomini, & that by the bleſſed touching of his fleſh, and blood whiche is moſte precious? as hee ſaith in the. 12. of Saint Luke, of this baptiſme namely the paſſion. I ſhalbe baptiſed with a certaine baptiſme, and how am I pained vntil it be ended? Heere we ſee with what ardent deſire hee deſired to ſanctifie the paſſions, & alſo dooth, and hath made them ſweet and amiable to vs, for he knew wel, that wee would be aſtonied at the afflictions & did wel foreſee, that we would be afraid of death and abhorre it, alſo willing to make an end of this our euilles as a moſte meek and prouidēt

paſtor, and as a moſte faithful phiſicion, he haſted him ſelf, and prolonged not the death, that hee might make ye afflictions & paſſions, yea the very death good to vs, by his holy ſuffring, ſo that wee may eſtéeme the death to a Chriſtian as the braſen ſerpent of Moiſes, whiche had the fygure of a ſerpent ouer all, and in all pointes and yet was nothing leſſe then liuing, he was without venim, without mouing, without byting, ſo likewiſe it ſeemeth to the eyes of the fooliſhe that the faithful dy, but truly they be in peace, we be like thē yt dy and the apparence of our death is none other but as others bee. Neuertheleſſe the trueth is otherwiſe, for to vs death is dead, alſo all our afflictions and paſſions bee like to their afflictiōs, but it is only by apparēce. For verely our paſſions be the beginninges of impaſſibilitie, as the death is the beginning of life. And this is it that the Lorde Jeſus ſaith, in the. 8

of Saint John. If any keepe my woord he ſhall neuer taſte of death. How ſhall he not ſee death? Becauſe that in dying hee beginneth to liue, and ſo the life that he be holdeth: cauſeth that he doothe not ſee death. The night is heer made bright as the day for aſmuche as the brightneſſe of the life beginning, is clearer then the death departing. Theſe thinges bee moſte certaine to all thoſe whiche beléeue in Jeſus Chriſte, but not to the vnfaithful. Now if they doo kiſſe, if they loue and embraſe the apparrel, the veſſelles, the cuppes, and finally thoſe thinges whiche Jeſus Chriſte hath touched, or that he vſed, ſo they honour thē, as great reliques, with great deuociō, becauſe they ſay that he hath ſāctified thē, by the touching therof. But wherfore doo we not the embrace, kiſſe, and loue rather the the paines, the ſhames, rebukes, the opprobries, the euilles of the world, and the very death, the whiche were

not onely ſanctified, by his holy touching: but alſo be bleſſed & dipped in his moſte precioꝰ blood, & embraſing them with a moſte ardent zeale and great charity, euē to the very death.
               Beholde in theſe thingꝭ wee haue much more reward, helth & goodnes, then in reliques. For truly by theſe thingꝭ, wee doo optain victory ouer death, hel, and all our ſinnꝭ, & not by reliques. O good God, if we might look into the hart of ye Sonne of God, and ſe perfectly whē he was ſtrained on the croſſe, yt he might rēder death dead & ouercome, and wt what ardent zeale & affection he embraſed ye death and the paines therof, for thoſe yt bee fearful & for thoſe yt abhorre death & the paines therof, and wt what redines & wil hee hath firſt drunk of this moſte bitte
                     •
                   cup, & after hath ſomonid ye weak & diſeaſed to drink therof, to the end yt they ſhould not feare to drink after him. Beholde & ſe that no euell is happened vnto him, but rather

a great ineſtymable benefyte hath followed in that he roſe again. It is moſte certain that this pretious mirrhe, is made moſte ſweet and amiable, diſtilling by the lippes, and the woordes of Jeſus Chriſte praiſing them, as the ſweet ſauour and beauty of lillies. Alſo Saint Peter ſaith, in his. 4. Chapiter in his. 1. Epiſtle. For aſmuche as Chriſte hath ſuffred in the fleſhe, arme your ſelues with the ſame minde. And to ye hebrewes. 12. Chapiter. Thapoſtle ſaith. Conſider diligently him that hath ſuffred ſuche gaine ſaying of ſinners againſt him ſelf, to the end that you ſhould not bee wery nor ſlack in youre mindes. Wherfore if we haue learned to ſuffer paciently the euellꝭ that be about vs and encloſe vs: beholde in this laſt conſiderations of our afflictions ſhadowed in Jeſus Chriſte, ſurmountith all euelles, and maketh yt we not onely endeuouring our ſelues to ſuffer: but alſo to loue, to wiſh

and ſerch for it. And the farther that one is from this affection and zeale: the leſſe ſtrength hath the paſſion of Jeſus Chriſte in him. And thoſe that wil worſhip the Roodes, Baners and Croſſes of Chriſte, for to put away death and afflictions, that they may not ſuffer them, and ſo not to dye: beholde they vſe meanes cleane contrary to the croſſe of Chriſte and his death. And for this cauſe it is neceſſary in this ſeuenth conſideration yt all ye afflictions whiche we ſuffer, ſhould bee conſumed, that it may not greeue vs to ſuffer, but rather to pleaſure in ſufferīg. This ought euer to bee in our hartes, and to be liuely rooted in our mindes.
            
         
         
            
            ¶ Heere foloweth the ſecond part of this treatiſe.
            ¶ Heer ſhalbe declared in this ſecond table, ſeuen conſiderations contrary to theſe before. The firſt ſhalbe the good within vs, the ſecond the good to come, the third the good paſſed, the fourth the good beneath vs, the fiſt the good on the left ſide, the ſixt the good on the right ſyde, the ſeuenth the good aboue vs.
            
               ¶ The firſt Chapiter of the firſt conſideration whiche is the good within vs.
               
                  WHat man is he that cā numbre the goodꝭ and treaſures, that one poſſeſſeth in his owne perſon? Firſt, who can eſteem how great the bodily graces bee? that is to ſay.

Helth, ſtrength, beauty, the quickening of the ſpirit, and alſo the noble kinde of man, whiche is mete to put in execution many excellent thinges as wel priuately as in publike, the whiche other creatures can not doo? But I pray you what great thing is it, if wee haue vſed theſe good giftꝭ, ten, twenty or thirty yeeres, with quietnes and pleaſures, by the grace and goodnes of God? And yet the Germaines haue a prouerb: there is many euelles in one good houre. What ought we to doo, wee that haue receiued ſo long reſt, and ſo many good houres, and will not ſuffer a little euel one poore houre? We ſe then how we be couered all with the goodnes of God. And how ſmall be the euelles that we be touched or ſtriken with (at the leaſt y• greateſt part of vs) our good God not being onely content with theſe goodes: but ioyneth to thē riches, abundance of all thinges? And although it bee not common to

all, yet it is to many, and principally to thoſe that bee not ſtrong enough, to ſuffer euelles and miſery. For as I haue ſaid before, he geueth greater ſtrength to thoſe whome he geueth leſſe goodes, that all thinges may be equall, & he may be knowen a righteous iudge in all thingꝭ. For great abundance of goodes and riches bringeth not ſo great conſolation: as dooth a good conſcience and a ioyful hart. And alſo hee geeueth to ſome plenty of children, whiche is a ſouereign pleaſure (as they ſay). To other glory, powre, principalitie, good renoume, fauour, honor and other like thinges, the whiche though they be geuen vs to pleaſure in, eyther long time or ſhort, yet they geue vs to vnderſtand, how we ſhall behaue our ſelues in ſmall euelles, when they come. But the goodes of the ſpirite, be muche more excellent then all theſe aforeſaid. As vnderſtanding, iudgement, facundity,

knowledge, prudence, or wiſedome. Now our good God, dooth moderate the equality of his adminiſtration in theſe goodes, aſwel as in the other, ſo that hee dooth not preferre the one before the other. For in ſteed of theſe goodes whiche lacketh to ſome: he geueth more courage, or more reſt, or greater tranquility. Now in all theſe thinges we muſt conſider the great liberalitie of God, with thankeſgeuing, and comfort our infirmitie, ſo that we doo not diſmay in our ſelues, although in this multitude of excellent goodes, there is ſome ſharpneſſe mingled with it. For among vs men that be volupteous, there is no meat ſodden, roſted or otherwiſe, what ſoeuer it be, whiche is found good nor ſauery without ſauce, that hath ſome egar taſte of nature, or that may ſeaſon it. For this is moſte true, that when one vſeth to eat nothing, but ſweet thinges, and dooth continew with the ſame: it is a thing intollerable,

ſo that it is wel ſaid of ſome, that ſay all pleaſure and volupteouſneſſe engendreth werines, when it is continued. Alſo volupruoſitie is finally conuerted into wearines and paine, that is to weet. This life is not ſo ſtrong, that it may beare the onely vſe of goodes and pleaſures, without ſome temperature of euelles mixed therewith. From thence commeth this prouerbe, that the bones ought to be ſtrong, whiche ſhould beare all their daies in welth and proſperitie. And for my part, I haue wel conſidered this prouerbe and oftentimes, and I maruail of the ſentence, which containeth ſo effectuall trueth. For ther is in mā certain deſtres whiche doo repugne the one againſt the other the whiche ſeeke but good daies, and neuertheleſſe, when they haue that they moſte deſire: they can leſſe ſuffer it, then if they had euel daies. For what dooth God ſet before vs in thys point: but that ye croſſe to bee meruailed

at, namely of the enemies of the croſſe? So that God dooth temper and ſeaſon all thinges, by theſe afore ſaid meanes, and ſanctifieth thē that they periſhe not, in ſuche maner as one ſalteth fleſhe, leaſt that therein breede mag
                     •
                  ts. From whēce commeth it then that wee doo not accept willingly, this temperature ſēt of God? For when he dooth not ſend it: our life whiche can not beare the voluptuous pleaſures of proſperitie, wyll call or deſire it of his owne proper accord. By this meanes we ſee how true it is that Salomon ſaith of God, whiche quencheth by little and little with great powre, and diſpoſeth all thingꝭ eaſely. For if they beholde wel theſe commodities: they may ſone know how true it is that is recited by Moiſes in the. 32. Chapiter of Deuteronomiū. He hath horne vs on his backe, hee hath led vs about, and preſerued vs, as the apple of his eye. By theſe thinges we may ſtoppe

ye mouthes of thoſe that wt great vnthankfulnes babble & ſay, that there is more euellꝭ in this life then goodꝭ. Beholde we haue no lack of felicitie and cō modities wt infinit nūbers of delectatiōs, but rather there is great lack of ſuche as doo wel vnderſtand, that the Pſalmiſt reciteth. The earth is full of ye mercy of the Lorde, and agaī the earth is ful of his praiſe. And in the Pſalm. 104. The earth is ful of thy bleſſing. Lorde thou haſte geuen me reioiſing in thy wurkꝭ. Frō thēce commeth it, yt they ſing in ye Churche ordinarely. The heauens and the earth, O Lord, be filled with thy glory. And wherfore is that? Becauſe that there is many felicities for the whiche he ought to be praiſed: but it is only for thoſe that haue their eies ſet to beholde his dooinges. For as we haue ſaid of the euelles in the firſt part. For the greater knowledge that any one hath: ſo muche more hath he the infelicitie great. And as

the goodes and commodities commeth about vs on euery ſide, and by a maner of ſaying doo blinde thē eies
               Neuertheleſſe they be no greater then we doo eſtee me them, for all thinges that God hath created bee excellent good, yea notwithſtanding they be not ſo known nor vnderſtād of all men, as it is ſaid of ſome, In ye Pſal. 77. They haue nothing eſteemed the Land whiche was good and pleaſaunt. Job geueth vs a good example of this ſpeculation, the whiche ſeing all his good quite from him and deffroied, ſaid. If we haue receiued goodneſſe at the hand of the Lorde: wherefore ſhall wee not alſo ſuffer euelles? Truly this is a wurd wurthy to be engraued within our hartꝭ, and a ſinguler cōfort of great powre in our temptations. For certainly Job did not onely ſuffer: but with the ſame hee was tempted with impatience of his owne wife, the whiche ſaid to him contemptuouſly. Thou

remaineſt ſtil in thy ſīplicity. Blaſpheme the Lorde and dye, as if ſhee had ſaid. All mē may plainly ſee that there is no God that wil leaue thee ſo and forſake thee. Wherefore then dooſt thou put thy truſt in him, and dooſt not rather deny him? And in ſuche ſort after ſhee had angred him, ſaid. Wherfore dooſt thou not knowledge thy ſelf to be mortall, and that nothing is left vnto thee after this life? There is none of vs the whiche his owne wife (that is to ſay ſenſualitie) ſhal not furniſh inough of ſuche matters, for the ſenſuall man vnderſtandeth not the thinges that 
                     •
                  e of God. Now all goodes that be corporall be common to all, but the Chriſtian and faithful hath other goodes muche more excellent, whiche be inward goodꝭ, that is to weet the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, of whom it is ſaid in the Pſalme. 44. The kinges daughter is all glorioꝰ within, her clothīg is all of wrought golde. For as ye
                     •
                  
                  
haue ſeene the euelles in the firſt cō
                  ſideration, that there is no euell ſo greate in man: as the euell within him. Alſo the faithful may not nor cā
                  not ſe the ineſtimable great goodnes or felicitie that is with in him, for if he felt it: be holde hee ſhould bee incontinent in heauen, for ye kingdome of heauen is within vs, as ſaith Jeſꝰ Chriſte. For to haue faith, is to haue the trueth & the wurd of God. Now to haue the wurd of God: is to haue God the creator & maker of all thīgꝭ And if theſe thinges were reueled to the ſoule, in ſuche perfection as they be in deede: ſhee would ſpring out of the body incontinent, for the great abundaunce of ioy and ſweetneſſe. Wherfore of good right, the louing corrections of whiche we haue ſpoke before, be called aduertiſementes of the goodes, whiche wee haue within vs, the whiche our good God declareth to vs by the ſame, becauſe this life can not bear nor ſuffer that they

vereueled to it, but thorow the great goodnes and mercy of God: they bee hidde to vs, vntil toey bee growen in their perfect meaſure. This is it that the Fathers and Mothers doo geue to their Children, ſometimes little Horſes, Tabors, Pipes and other trifels, by the whiche they doo incite and ſtur vp the mindes of their children, to greater and more excellente thinges. Neuertheles they doo break foorthe and ſhew them ſelues ſometimes, as when the conſcience reioiceth and triumpheth in the confidēce and ſure truſt of God, and when ſhee ſpeaketh willingly and frely of God, when ſhee heareth his wurd with a gratioꝰ eare and an attentife heart, when ſhe is brought to be ready and diligent to ſerue him, obey him, to doo good wurkes and to ſuffer aduerſities, the whiche thinges be certain tokens of an ineſtimable good, which is therein hidden, the whiche ſpringeth out thorow a certain conduit by

ſmall droppꝭ, although it happeneth ſometimes that this is reueled more fully at large, vnto thoſe ſpirites whiche be geuen to contemplation, ſo they finde them ſelues as it were ſwallowed vp: yt they wot not where they be, as Saint Auguſtine confeſſeth him ſelf to be and many others.
            
            
               ¶ The ſecond Chapiter of the ſecond conſideration the which is the good to come or before vs.
               
                  THoſe that be no Chriſtians can finde no great comefort in hope of the good to come, in the middes of their troubles, becauſe all thinges be to them vncertaine. For this affection and vaine hope, dooth bring to them a certaine tumult, but thorow faith wee doo comfort one an other freendly. And wee doo hope for better thinges, but the weaker doo at

tempt & clime vp to great thingꝭ and oftē in vncertitude, & yet they be oftē deceiued & voyd of their hope, as Jeſus Chriſte ſheweth in ye. 12. of S. Luke, of him yt ſaid to his ſoule. I wil pul down my barns, & make thē greater & ſay to my ſoule. Take thy reſt, drīk, eat & make good cheer, for yu haſt goodꝭ inough for many yeers but God ſaid. Fool, this night ſhal thy ſoule be taken frō thee: & the goodꝭ that yu haſt heapid together, whoſe ſhall they be thē? Euen ſo is it wt him yt gathereth treaſure & is not riche in God. But ye Chriſtians haue a more excellēt felycitie whiche commeth certainly, but it is thorow afflictions & death. Alſo they reioice in a certaine & ſure hope ſo that the preſent euel endeth, and contrary ye good augmenteth whiche is the verity in Jeſus Chriſte, where in they proſpet and profit, from day to day, and for the loue thereof they liue in hope, and ouer & aboue theſe thinges, they haue two moſte great commodities

in the death to come. Firſt the death is an end of all the tragedy of euelles, of this preſent life, as it is written. The death of the faithfull is pretious before the face of God, & againe. I ſhall ſleepe in peace and reſt me. If the righteous be preuented by death: hee findeth quickening and comfort. And contrary the death to the wicked, and Infidels: is the beginning of euelles, as it is ſaid. The death of the wicked is moſte vnhappy, alſo the euel dooth ouertake and katche ye wicked in his death. In this maner was Lazarꝰ cōforted yt which hath receiued heere his euel, and the riche glotton, vnhappy was tormented, becauſe hee receiued his goodes heere in this life. By this meanes alſo it commeth that the Chriſtian findeth him ſelf alwayes better and encreaſing in goodneſſe, whether he liue or whether he dye, ſo bleſſed a thing it is to be a Chriſtian, and to beleue in Jeſus Chriſte, and therefore

Saint Paule ſaith. Chriſt is to me aduauntage, whether I liue or whether I dy. And to the Romaines. 15. Hee that liueth: liueth to the Lorde, and he that dieth, dieth to the Lorde, be it whether we liue, or whether we dy: we be the Lordes. Jeſus Chriſte hath begotten vs this aſſurance. For he is dead and riſen againe, to thend that he might be Lorde of the quicke and the dead, hauing powre to make vs ſure and to certify vs aſwel in the death as in the life, as is ſaid in the. 23. Pſalme. Though I ſhould walke in the middeſt of the ſhadow of death yet wil I feare no euel, for thou art with mee. But if we be not certified of this aduauntage of death: it is a ſign that the faith of Jeſꝰ Chriſt is in firm and weak in vs, the whiche doo not wurthely eſteeme the gaine and price of his moſte precioꝰ death. They cannot beleue yet the death to be good: becauſe that is letted by the olde man, and the wiſedome of the

fleſhe, whiche hath yet to muche vigour and ſtrength, and therfore wee ought to aſſay and auaunce to know and to loue this benefite of death. It is a hard ſaying and difficul, to ſay that the death which is to others the greatiſt of all euelles, ſhalbee to vs the moſte excellent gaine and profit. And if Ieſꝰ Chriſte had not wrought this good in vs: what profit were it for vs to habandon and forſake our ſelues? But this wurke that he hath wrought in vs, is a ſinguler deuine wurk. For this cauſe no man ought to diſmay, for he hath made the euel of death to bee turned to moſte good and profit. Wherefore death is now to the faithful dead, and is not terrible but only the outward apparence, euen as a ſlaine ſerpent hath yet remaining the terrible figure or apparence of a ſerpent that hee had: and yet is it but the figure or image. So there is but one euel dead, and it may no more noy or hurt vs. And

alſo as Moyſes cōmaunded to make a ſerpent of braſſe, and to beholde and looke vpon it, did put away the ſtinging of the quicke ſerpentꝭ, as it is ſaid, in the. 21. of Numery: likewiſe if our death be looked vpon with a godly eye, and ſtedfaſt in the faith of Chriſte: it periſheth and nothing appereth but onely ye figure of death. So louingly dooth the bountifulnes and mercy of God entreat vs, which yet be weaklinges and infirme thorow theſe and ſuche like figures, becauſe of neceſſitie, death muſt take vs away. Neuertheleſſe he hath ſo ouercome and brought to nought the ſtrength and powre of death, that to vs remaineth no more but the onely figure, and for this cauſe the ſcriptures doo rather call it a ſleepe then a death. The ſecond benefite of death is, that not only it maketh an end of paines and euelles of this preſent life: but alſo bringeth a more excellent thing, that is an end of vice and

ſin, the whiche cheefly maketh death moſte deſirable to the faithfull ſoulꝭ, yea more then dooth any worldly felicitie, as wee haue treated heere before. For truly the euellꝭ of the ſoule whiche is vice and ſinne, be without compariſon, worſe then the euelles of the body, for if we were wiſe: theſe onely euelles in deede ſhould make to vs death more deſirable, and more louingly to embrace it, whiche if it doo not: it is a ſigne that we feel not that we ought to feel, nor yet doo ſufficiently hate the euelles of our ſoulles, conſidering that this life, is ſubiect to many daungers, and the fallīg and ſliding of ſinne dooth compaſſe vs about, with ſnares on euery ſyde. And finally wee cannot liue without ſynne. Beeholde then that death is a moſte ſinguler good remedy, for it deliuereth vs from theſe daungers, it cutteth vs away and deliuereth vs wholy from ſinne, and therefore the authour of the booke of Sapience

concludeth in the praiſe of the righteouſe in the. 4. Chapiter, ſaying. Being made at one and beloued of God liuing amongeſt ſinners, was taken away and trāſported to the end that ſinne and euell ſhould not chaunge his vnderſtanding or that deceitfulneſſe ſhould not begile his ſoule, for the bewitching of lies and dremes maketh good thinges darke, the vnſtedfaſtnes of volupteous deſire: turneth away the vnderſtanding of the ſiple. O how true be theſe thingꝭ? & how doo we ſe this to come pas daily? And in an other text. Though he was ſoone dead: yet fulfilled hee muche time, for his ſoule pleaſed God, therfore he haſted to take him away frō among the wicked. So it cōmeth to paſſe by the mercy of God, that the death whiche was the paine of ſinne to man: is now made the ende of ſin, and the beginning of life and righteouſneſſe to the Chriſtian. Therfore of neceſſitie hee that loueth life and

ryghteouſneſſe: loueth alſo death, whiche is the miniſter and the ſhop of life, and is in no cace afraid of it. For otherwiſe he ſhall neuer attaine to life nor righteouſnes, and he that cannot ſo doo: let him be diligent to pray to God that he may haue ſuche aminde. For the cauſe why God teacheth vs to ſay, thy will be doone, is that we can not deſire this of our ſelues, but we rather doo abhorre death, ſo that wee doo rather loue ſinne and death: then life and righteouſneſſe. Therfore did God ordeine death, for the deſtruction of ſinne. For we may gather by this, that incontinent after ſin hee ſet & ordeined death to Adam as a deliuerance from ſin, and that before hee caſt him out of Paradice, to the ende that hee would ſhew vs that death neither dooth nor wurketh any euell in vs but is the cauſer of all good, for it was ſet forth in Paradice in maner of a ſatiſfaction. But trueth it is, by the enuy of the

deuel, death is entred into the world, but thorow the mercy and goodneſſe of God, hee dooth cauſe that death is not hurtful to vs, but hath ordeined it from the beginning, to bee the puniſhement and death of ſinne, for he ſignified the ſame when he ſpake before of death to Adam in the cōmaundement. Neuertheles he ſtayed not in his wurds: but pronounced death and qualifyed the rigour of the commaundement. But GOD did not in plaine wurdꝭ declare death: but only ſaid, thou art duſt, and into duſt thou ſhalt return. Item thou ſhalt return into earth frō the which thou art come. As euen then hating death would not name it, as it is ſaid.
               Wrath is in his indignation, and life in his wil. Now it may be ſaid that if death had not bene neceſſary, to put away ſin: God would not haue pronounced it But God taketh no other wepons againſt ſinne whiche hath engendred death, but death it

ſelf. Heere is fulfilled that one ſaid properly, that the inuentor of death is dead by his owne inuencion, alſo the ſinne is deſtroyed by his owne frute, and ſlaine by the death that he hath engēdred. As a viper is ſlain by her owne yung ſerpentꝭ. Beeholde a thing moſte pleaſaunt to heere and vnderſtand, that ſinne is deſtroyed by no other meanes, but by her own proper wurk, and her throte cut by her owne knife, and her hed cut of by her owne ſwoord as was Goliath. Goliath was the figure of ſin. This Giaunt was fearfull to all men except to little Dauid, that is to ſay the Sonne of GOD Jeſus Chriſte: the whiche hath ouerthrowen this terrible Giant, and hath cut of his hed with his owne ſwoord. Now it may be ſaid that there is no ſwoord meter thē Goliath owne ſwoord. 1. Samuel. 21. Chapiter. If now wee doo meditate theſe ioyes of the vertue of the Sōne of GOD and the giftꝭ of his grace,

how ſhould any little euell torment vs: ſeing ſo great euellꝭ whiche may happen is turned to ſo great good?
            
            
               ¶ The third Chapiter of the third conſideration whiche is the good paſſed or after vs.
               
                  THis good is eaſy to conſider by his oppoſit or contrary euel paſſed, onely it is a help to him yt would conſider heere Saint Auguſtine in his confeſſions, Hee is a good teacher in this, where hee reciteth the good graces and benefites that hee hath receiued from his mothers wombe. So is likewiſe the Pſalmiſt in the. 138. Pſalme. Saying. Lorde thou haſt prooued me, or among other thinges meruailing of the prouidence of God, vpon him ſelf ſaith▪ Thou haſt knowen my thoughtes afar of, thou haſt tried my hart and my raines, as if he had ſaid

I ſee now how far of it is from mee all that euer I thought or did, or all that I might obtain or poſſes, or how little is put in execution by my proper meanes or induſtry, but that all this hath bene diſpoſed and ordained long time before by thy ordinaunce and prouidence (O Lorde) breefly thou haſt foreſeene all my waies, or rather in thy might and powre wee doo learn theſe thinges by our owne experience, for if wee call to remembraunce our life paſſed, is it notenough to aſtunny vs that wee haue thought willed, doone, and ſaid ſuche thinges, whiche we haue little or nothing foreſeene? How often had wee doone things, cleane contrary, if we had bene left in our owne free wil? So that we now beginning to vnderſtand and to beholde the prouidence and care of God, to bee preſent and fauourable toward vs by his vigilāt help and ſuccoure, that wee haue nether thought willed nor ſaid, but that

he hath before ordeined. As it is ſaid in the. 7. Chapiter of Sapience. We and our wurdes be all in the hand of God, as Saint Paule ſaith, the which dooth all thinges in vs. Wherefore then bee wee ſo without vnderſtanding, and haue our hartes ſo hardened? Wherefore be we not aſhamed miſerable that wee bee? that beeing ſhewed by our owne proper experience wee ſeeing plainly and openly, how often the Lorde hath bene careful for vs, and watcheful euen vnto this houre, and how he hath endowed vs wt all maner of good and great benefites, and yet cannot wee reſign and acknowledge to him the onely care and watche ouer vs in a very little preſent euel. But wee behaue our ſelues as though hee had forſaken vs or as though that wee could put it of or quit our ſelues of it. Is it not ſaid in the. 139. Pſalme. I am poore and miſerable but the Lorde careth for me? Vpon this. S. Auguſtine ſaith.
               
                  He that made thee careth for thee. Permit and rendre to him that made thee, before thou were any thing, to haue cure and charge of thee. How ſhould hee not now haue cure ouer thee, foraſmuche as thou art now that ſame that hee would haue thee? But we wil be partakers of his kingdome with him, wee doo attribute to him this, that hee made vs, and yet wil we ſcarcely doo that: or at the leaſt doo it very coldely, and yet notwithſtanding we vſurpe the cuſtody that he hath ouer vs, as if he (after he had made vs) would retire him ſelf farre from vs, to forſake vs and leaue vs in our owne hands. But if our wiſedome, councelles, and deliberations doo let vs or blinde our eyes that wee can not ſee this care of GOD ouer vs, when paraduenture many thinges happen to vs according to our deliberations and purpoſes: let vs returne to the Pſalmiſt in ye. 138. Pſalm. and conſider our owne ſelues, whiche

ſaith. My bones are not hidden from thee (O Lorde) ſaith hee, though I was made in a ſecret place, that is to ſay. Thou ſaweſt my bones in my mothers womb, when as yet I was not, and when my mother knew not what was made in her, and my ſubſtaunce was in the loweſt partes of the earth, that is to ſay, the figure or forme of my body was not hidden to thee beeing in the profound entrailles of my mother, for thou formedſt them and made them What dooth he declare by theſe wurdes, but onely propoſeth this great example how our good God hath alwaies had care of vs without vs? What is he that glory that he hath made any thing of that is made? Who hath geuen vnderſtāding or knowledge, to the mothers to geue ſucke, to entertaine, nouriſhe, loue, and doo all dutyes & offices of a mother, euen then when we did not feele our life, brefly, wee know, not theſe thinges and beleeue

not that they were doone to vs, if wee had not ſeene the like thinges doone to others whiche were doone to vs, euen as though wee had ſlept, or as though we had beene dead, or more aptly to ſay, as if we had not yet bene borne, as touching our owne knowledge. Alſo ſeeing how true this is, yt without our help wee haue beene brought and directed vnto deuine cō
                  fort and great mercifulneſſe, and yet we dout or that worce is we diſpaire that our good God hath care of vs. If parauenture there be any whiche is not inſtructed or moued by this experience: I know no way how hee may be taught or inſtructed, for there is not one Infant that wee doo ſee with our eyes but may inſtruct vs, in this ca
                     •
                  e euidently. Now ſeeing ſo many examples ſetle before our eyes: we ought to be aſhamed of our foly and ignorance. But if we dout that any maner of good or euell may happen to vs, how little ſo euer it bee, without

the ſinguler prouidence of God, read Saint Peter in his firſt Epiſtle the fift Chapiter. Caſt all oure care vpon him, for he careth for vs, and in thē. 54. Pſalme. Caſt thy care vpon the Lord, and hee ſhall nuriſhe thee.
               And. S. Auguſtine ſpeaketh in his confeſſions to his ſoule. Wherefore dooſt thou ſtay thee vpon thy ſelf, and continueſt not firme and ſtable? caſt thy ſelf vpon thy God, for hee wil not withdraw his hand from thee nor ſuffer thee to fall. And moreouer Saint Peter ſaith in the. 4. Chapiter of his firſt Epiſtle. Thoſe that ſuffer by the wil of God: let them commit their ſoules in well dooing to the creator whiche is moſte faithful. O the bountifulneſſe of our GOD. If any may know God in this maner, in what ſuerty, reſt and ioy ſhall he liue? Suche a one hathe GOD verely within him. He is well aſſured and moſte certaine that all that he hath or may haue, be it great or ſmall thinges, or

what ſo euer ſhall happen or con
                     •
                  e to him at any time, that it commeth by the good wil and diſpoſition of God. The ſentence of Saint Peter ſtandeth allwaies moſte true and vndouted. He hath care for you. May one heare wurdes more ſweet and comfortable then theſe? and therefore he ſaith. Caſt all your care vpon him, but now if wee doo not: what other thing doo wee but aſſay and prooue to ſtop and let the care that GOD hath of vs, and to bring oure life ful of ſorow, heuines and care, with thought & turmoiling within our ſelues. And what cā we get by thus dooing? Our ſaluation is nothing aduaunced nor preferred, but as ſaith Eccleſiaſtes. It is a vanitie of vanities and affliction of ſpirit, for that booke ſpeaketh againſt ſuche doutfulneſſe in ſuche wiſe, as hee that had prooued many thinges in him ſelf. Neuertheleſſe could finde in all theſe thinges but labour vanity and affliction of ſpirit

ſo that hee concludeth that it is a gift of God, for any man to eat drink and reioice with his wife, that is to ſay, if he liue without care, committyng to GOD all the care of him ſelf and his, Wherfore to conclude we ought not to be careful for oure ſelues, nor to pluck from God the care ouer vs, thus you may eaſely vnderſtand the reſt, as I haue ſaid before by the calling to minde your life paſſed.
            
            
               ¶ The fourth Chapiter of the fourth conſideration of the good vnder vs.
               
                  HEtherto wee haue ſeene the goodꝭ whiche be oures and whiche bee in our ſelues, now let vs ſee thoſe that bee in others, and wt
                  out vs. The firſt of theſe is in thoſe that be vnder vs, that is to ſay in the reprobate damned ſoules, but this is wundrefull. For what good may

one finde in the dead and 
                     〈…〉
                  ? But ye mercy and goodneſſe of God is ſo great vniuerſally, that he teacheth vs to ſe our good in ye middeſt of great euelles. Let vs in the firſt place compare them and vs together; and then we ſhall ſee our 
                     •…
                  able gaines, as one may gather eaſely by the oppoſit conſideratiōs or contrary euelles. For ſo many euelꝭ of death, hell and dampnation as wee doo ſee in them: ſo many gaines doo wee ſee in our ſelues, and ſo muche the greater as theſes be gre
                     •
                  o and great. This conſideration ought not lightly to be paſſed ouer, becauſe theſe thinges doo propoſe and ſet before our eyes the great merey of God whiche is moſte excellent and meruailous, and it is daungerous not to way theſe things ſo great and excellent, that wee be not found ingrate and on thankfull, and to be dampned with the or more greuouſſy tormented▪ And the more that weeſe them howle and lament:

the more wee ought to reioice in the bounty and mercy of God towardes vs, according as is ſaid in ye. 65. Chapiter of Eſay. Beholde my ſeruauntes eat and drink, and you dy in hunger and ſorow & languor for thirſt. Beeholde my ſeruauntes reioice in great gladneſſe of hart, & you houle and lament for the very dolours and ſorow of your hartes, and cry for the great oppreſſion of ſpirit, your name ſhall not be ſworne by among my elect. &c. Finally as I haue ſaid theſe horrible examples of euel liuers and reprobate, doo help and further to our aduertiſement & geueth vs good inſtructions as Saint Gregory reciteth in his dialogues, that hee is happy whiche can beware by the daungers of others. And although this benefit touche not our hartes but faintly, becauſe it is common and happeneth often: yet neuertheles it is wurthy to bee eſtemed and numbred among ye greateſt benefitꝭ, and greatly

approoued of wiſe men, and of thoſe that haue godly vnderſtanding. Beholde a great part of the holy ſcriptures, teache to this ende. And when we be taught and ſhewed the wrath, the iudgementes and horrible threatninges of GOD, what helthful doctrines doo theſe examples bring to vs of theſe accurſed & miſerable people, for to confirme vs more & more?
               It dooth then begin to make vs the more to feele the effect and ſtrength thereof: when wee doo put vpon vs the affection of thoſe that doo ſuffer, & after a maner to ſay when wee be in their place and perſon, for then they doo moue vs and aduertiſe vs greatly to praiſe and magnify the goodnes of him, whiche hath preſerued vs frō theſe horrible euelles. Now let vs be holde the iuſtice of Godꝭ diuinitie in them. Foraſmuche as God is a iuſt iudge, therefore muſt wee loue & greatly praiſe his righteouſnes and iuſtice, and by this meanes reioice

in God, euen when he deſtroyeth the wicked body & ſoule. For his admirable and great iuſtice, ſhineth in a a merueilous maner in all theſe thinges. For the very hell is filled wt the mageſty and goodneſſe of God, as alſo is the heauens. For the iuſtice of God, is God him ſelf. And God is the high ſoueraigne goodneſſe. And therefore as wee ought to loue the bounty and mercy of God: ſo ought wee alſo to loue his iuſtice and iudgement, to praiſe it and ſhew it forth. In this ſence Dauid ſaith. The righteous ſhall reioice when he ſhall ſe the vengeaunce, hee ſhall waſhe his handes in the bloud of the wicked. Alſo the Lorde for bad Samuel any lenger to lament Saul, as it is written in the .16. Chapiter of the firſt booke of Samuell, ſaying. How long wilt thou la ment Saull? Beholde I haue caſt him of that hee reigne no more 
                     •
                  uer Iſraell, as if hee had ſaid, dooth my wil diſpleaſe thee, that thou preferriſt

the wil of mā before mine? Breefly this is the voice of praiſe and reioyſing, the whiche is ſo often ſpokē of in the Pſalmes, that the Lorde is the iudge of widowes, and father of orphelins, hee wil reuenge the poore and the oppreſſed, his enemies ſhalbe confounded, the wicked ſhalbee deſtroyed, & many other like thingꝭ. But if any of a fooliſhe pitie, will lament or bewaile this cruel generation, the whiche hath not onely put to death the righteous and innocent, but alſo the Sonne of GOD, and all by the conſpiracy of theſe wicked impes: ſhall he not be found as one that reioyceth in their eniquitie with thē and approuing that which they haue doone, yea and is woorthy to periſhe with thē which would not haue their ſinnes puniſhed? Now heare that is ſaid in the .19. Chapiter of the ſecond booke of Samuel. Thou loueſt thoſe which hate thee, & hateſt thoſe yt loue thee. This Joab ſaid to Dauid

when hee lamented ouermuche for his murderer Abſalom. Wherefore in this conſideration we ought to reioyce together with all the faithfull of GOD, for his righteouſneſſe the which puniſheth moſte iuſtly the perſecutors of the true religion, to the end that the elect of God may be deliuered from the hand of them. In this part we ſe ſhining in the reprobate and dampned ſuche benefites & treſures as bee not ſmall, but great and excellent, that is to ſay, the vengeaunce of the outrage doone to the faithful, yea the iniury doon to thee if thou be righteoꝰ with them, wherefore then bee not diſmaied if God by thy preſent euil, hee taketh vengeaunce of thine enemy, that is to ſay, the ſin of thy body, but rather thou oughteſt to reioyce, & to praiſe God, for the execution hereof, whiche is moſte iuſt and right, whiche yet before thou cāſt open thy mouth to pray dooth ſley and diſtroy in thy ſelf the

moſte wicked enemy that thou haſt, that is the ſinnes that is within thee, but if thou haſt compaſſion of this enemy: thou ſhalt be found a freend of ſinne, and enemy of iuſtice and righteouſneſſe whiche woorketh in thee. Wherfore wee ought to take heed that it bee not ſayd to vs, thou loueſt thoſe that hate thee: and hateſt thoſe that loue thee. For as thou oughteſt to reioyce in the iuſtice of God, perſe cuting thy ſinne: euen ſo reioice in the execution againſt ſinners, enemies to God and to man. We heare now what excellēt benefites is foūd in great and horrible euelꝭ, and how we ought to reioyce in our great miſeries, not becauſe of ye euelꝭ it ſelf: but becauſe of the ineſtimable goodneſſe and iuſtice of God, the which taketh vengeaunce of oure ſinnes and wickednes.
            
            
               ¶ The fift Chapiter of the fyfth conſideration of the good on the left hand.
               
                  
                  HEre is to be ſpoken of the aduerſaries that be yet liuing in the world, for in the Chapiter going before we haue treated of the aduerſaries that be all damned & made like to the deuelles, but we muſt conſider theſe heere with an other affection, and conſider them two maner of waies. Firſt they abound and proſper in temporall thingꝭ, in ſuche ſort that the Prophetꝭ them ſelues were almoſte moued to enuy thē, becauſe of their felicitie, as it is ſaid in the. 73. Pſalme. My foot had all moſte ſlipped, my ſteps were almoſte gone ſeeyng the wicked in ſuche proſperitie and felicitie, I had euen all moſte borne them enuy. And in the ſame Pſalme. Beholde the wicked (habunding in iniquitie) haue obtayned great riches. And in the. 12. of Jeremy.

Thou art verely righteous Lord when I doo argue againſt thee, neuertheleſſe I ſhall conſider of the thinges that be righteous with thee. Wherfore doo I ſee the wicked proſper, the affaires of all thoſe whiche wurk wickedneſſe and goe forward. But ye queſtions is, Wherefore dooth he poure vpon them ſo great benefites, and ſo vndeſerued: but to the end to comefort vs, and to ſhew how good he wil be to them that are of an vpright hart, as it is ſaide in ye ſame Pſalme. He that is ſo good to the wicked: how muche more wil he be good to the faithful? and in that he dooth not tormēt the wicked with any maner euelles, but the good he prooueth them by many euellꝭ: that they may know that he is good to them, not onely in goodes that be preſent: but alſo in riches whiche bee hidden and inuinſible, that they may ſay with the Pſalmiſt. It is good for me to ioyne my ſelf to the Lorde, and to ſet

my hope and truſt in my God, as if he had ſaid. Although I ſuffer, ſeeing them deliuered and free without trouble, yet I haue this confidence, that God wil let me feele his clemency and goodneſſe muche more then ſhall they. And therefore the diſible goodes of the wicked: bee ſpurres to moue vs to truſt in the inuiſible goodꝭ and to diſpiſe & ſet light by the euellꝭ whiche we ſuffer. It is it that ye Lord Jeſus commaundeth vs in the ſixt Chapiter of Saint Mathew, to beholde the birdes of the ayre and the Lillyes of the feeld, ſaying. If God ſo clothe the graſſe whiche is to day in his flowre and to morow caſt into the furnace: how muche rather wil he clothe you? O ye of little faith. Wherefore by the compariſon of the goodꝭ, whiche the wicked abuſe and the euelles and miſeries whiche wee ſuffer: our faith is exerciſed, and wee obtaine conſolation in God, whiche is the moſte holy conſolatiō and comfort.

So neceſſary it is that all thingꝭ happen to the beſt to ye faithful. The other goodes, whiche is muche more to be meruailed at: is that their euelles be turned to our good and profite as GOD hath ordeined it. For all though their ſinnes be offenſiue to ye weakeſt and infirm and feeble ſ
                     ••
                  lꝭ, neuertheles they be exerciſes of vertue, and of ſpirituall battaile and of greater helth to the ſtrong and faithful. For bleſſed is the man that ſuffreth in temptation, for when he ſhal be tried: he ſhall receiue a crowne of life. Now is there a greater temptation then theſe multitude of moſte euell examples? And ye cheefe reaſon why the world is called an enemy to the faithful and electe of God: is that by their enticementes and wicked wurkes, they may draw vs, allure, prouoke and turne vs from the way of God to their wayes. As is ſaide in ye. 6. of Geneſis. The Sonnes of God ſaw the daughters of men that they

were faire, and ioyned them ſelues to them. Alſo in Numeri. 25. Chapiter. The Children of Iſrael are fallē with the daughters of the Moabites, inſomuche that it is a thing helthful to vs to be continually preſſed & holden down by ſome miſfortune, ſo that we ſtriuing with the euell occaſions of the world: fall not into ſinne and wickedneſſe, we I ſay that be ſo weake. Alſo Saint Peter in the. 2. Chapiter of his ſecond Epiſtle commendeth Lot, for that he ſuffred many wicked examples of the Sodomites, ſo that he profited and encreaced in righteouſnes thorow theſe thīgꝭ. Therfore it is neceſſary ye offences happen whiche engender warre and victory. Yet notwithſtanding, wo bee to ye world becauſe of offences. Now if God procure vs ſo great goodneſſe, in the ſinnes and wickedneſſe of others: how muche more ought we to beleeue with all our hartes that hee ſhall procure and turne into good our

euelles and miſfortunes, although the ſence and feeling of the fleſhe iudgeth otherwiſe? The world bringeth vs no leſſe goodneſſe on the other ſide with his euelles, whiche is called aduerſitie & miſery. For thoſe whiche he can not ſwallow by enticementes and incorporate to him ſelf by offences: hee aſſayeth to repulſe and put fro him by aduerūtyes, and driueth them of by paines and tormentes, procuring alwaies againſt them ſnares by examples of ſin, & foining out his furies by horrible tormentes and paines. This is the monſter that the Poets doo call Chimery, whiche hath the hedde of a damoſell and gratious countenaunce, the wombe of a Lion, and the taile of a venemus ſerpent. For the ende to whiche the world pretendeth, what with his volupteouſnes, and what wt his tiranny: is poiſoned death and dampnation eternally. So now wee ſee that God hath made vs to finde

our cheef goodꝭ in ye midſt of the ſinn
                     •
                   of ye world, to thend that ye perſecutious and afflictions whiche he ſendeth be not to vs idle nor vaī. They be or deyned vs for the encreaſing of oure benefites, in ſuche wiſe that the ſame wherewith the world dooth noy and moleſt vs: be conſtrained to profit vs. As Saint Auguſtine ſaith of the litle Children that Herod put to death. That hee neuer profyted ſo muche by loue and good wil: as hee did by hate. And Saint Agathe went into the Priſon very ioyouſly as to a banket, ſaying thus. If thou dooſt not tame my bodye by thy tormentors: my ſoule ſhall not come into heauen, for to receiue ye moſte bleſſed crown.
               And as the graine of wheat is not laid vp into the barnes, but firſt is driuen out of the eare, and ſore beatē in the ayer barne. But wherefore doe wee tary vpon thinges ſo ſmall, ſeeyng the holy ſcriptures and all ye ſayinges of the auncient fathers, the

actes of all the holy faithfull ſaintes and ſeruauntꝭ of God accord to this? For thoſe that ſeem to be moſte hurtful to the beleuers: be thoſe that doo them moſte good, if they doo ſuffer it patiently. As Saint Peter ſaith in the. 3. Chapiter of his. 1. Epiſtle. And who is hee that can hurt you if ye folow that is good. And in the Pſalme. 
                     ••
                  . His enemy ſhall not ouertake him, and the ſonne of wickednes ſhal not hurt him. And how ſhall he not hurt him? Doothe hee not kil often?
               But yet in hurting and meleſting, he dooth ſeruice and profit very much to the faithful. So now we may ſee our ſelues dwelling in the midſt of al perfect goodnes whiche compaſſeth vs about on euery ſide If we be wiſe and conſider them with a godly eye, and notwithſtanding yet we remain in the midſt of thaforſaid euelles. So wunderfully be thinges tempered and mingled by the cōning and meruelous wurk of Godꝭ diuine power.
            
            
               
               ¶ The ſixt Chapiter of the ſixth conſideration of the good on the right hand.
               
                  THis benefit is the Church or congregation of the faithful, the new creature of God, our brethern and freendes, wherein we ſee nothing but all goodnes and conſolation, although we ſe not this continually with the corporall eyes as we may ſee in the contrary Image of euelles: but wt the ſpirituall eye, and alſo that thoſe goodes, whiche we ſee the faithful poſſeſſe, be not to bee reiected: but rather to conſider yt God dooth comfort vs in ſuch cōmodities, For the Pſalmiſt in the. 73. Pſalme durſt not condemne nor reiect thoſe that poſſeſſed riches of the worlde, ſaithe. If I ſhould ſpeak ſo: I ſhould condemn the generatiōs of thy Children, that is to ſay. If I ſhould ſay, that they be all wicked, and that all

thoſe that be riche, honorable, & helthful, be reprobate: I ſhould condemne thy very ſeruauntes, of whom there be riche, honorable, & helthfull. And alſo where as Saint Paul exhorteth Timothe to geue commaundement to the riche of this world that they be not proud, yet hee dooth not forbid to haue riches: and the ſcriptures ſheweth that Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, were riche, and Daniell and his felowes were honored in Babilō, and alſo many other kingꝭ in Juda were found faithful ſeruauntes of GOD. The Pſalmiſt caſteth his eyes vpon theſe, and ſaith. If I had ſo ſayd: I had reproued the generations of thy Children, GOD (I ſay) geueth abundance of theſe riches to his people of tentimes, for the releefe aſwel of thē ſelues as of others, but theſe goodes be not there owne proper & effectuall goodes: but onely figures and ſhadowes of the true goodes, whiche bee faith, hope, charitie and other graces

and giftes, whiche bee all made commō by charitie. This is the communion of ſaintes in the whiche wee ſhould glory. And who is he that wil not recoyce now, yea although it be in the middeſt of great euelles, if hee beleue that this is true, that is to ſay If he beleeue that the goodneſſe of all the Saintes be his, and that his euel is their euel alſo? This Image is moſte pleaſaunt and amiable to beholde, whiche the Apoſtle to the Galathians painteth and deſcribeth to vs in this ſorre. Beare the burthens one of an other, and ſo fulfil the law of Chriſte. Is not this a good thing to be in ſuche a 
                     •
                  ace: that when one member ſuffreth, all the reſt ſuffer alſo? and when one is glorified all the other reioyce with him? As it is ſaid in Saint Paule to the Corinthians. When I ſuffer, I ſuffer not alone, Jeſus Chriſte and all the Chriſtians ſuffer with mee, as God him ſelf ſaith. He that toucheth you toucheth

the apple of mine eye. Alſo the Churche dooth feele and beare with my burthen, their vertue is my vertue, the faith of the Churche and cō
                  gregation dooth ſtrengthen my Infidelitie. The chaſtitie of the Churche dooth help to beare with the temptation of my fleſhe. The praier of them is watcheful for mee, and alſo moſte neceſſary. Breefly the members haue ſuche care the one for the other, that the moſte honeſt doo couer the moſte ſimple, they doo ſerue them and honour thē, as the Apoſtle doothe very wel deſcribe to ye Corinthians. Now in this cace I may glory, that is, in the goodnes of other as in mine owne proper, and alſo they be mine owne when I am content to communicate with them. Now though I bee filthy and wretched, yet thoſe that I loue and of whome I am one, be fair and beautifull, by the whiche loue I make not onely their goodnes mine: but alſo them ſelues bee made mine,

and therefore vnder the glory of thē my ſhame ſhalbe couered and bewtified, by their habundance: my pouertie ſhalbe fulfilled. Who is he thē yt can diſpaire in his ſinnes? Who is he that wil not now reioyce in his afflictions and ſuffringes? For beholde he beareth no more his afflictions and paines, but they doo beare with him, he beareth thē not alone: but is holpen by a bleſſed company of the Children of God, and of Jeſus Chriſte him ſelf. Suche an excellent thing is it to be of the Communion of the faithful, and of the Churche of Jeſus Chriſte. But if there be any that beleueth not theſe thinges to be thus: he is an Infidel, and dooth diſalow Jeſus Chriſte and his Churche, becauſe he feeleth not theſe thinges whiche be infallible true. But what is the cauſe that thou falleſt not into diſpaire, and that thou art not become vtterly vnpacient? Is it thy vertue? No truly, but the communion of

the faithfull. For otherwiſe thou couldeſt not beare the leaſt ſin that is, nor ſuffer one wurd of a man ſpoken againſt thee. So good is Jeſus Chriſte to thee, and ſo nigh to thee is he and his Churche. This is it that we ſay, I 
                     •
                  eleeue in the holy Ghoſte & the holy vniuerſal congregatiō or Churche. What is it to beleeue ye holy Churche vniuerſall, but the communion of the holy and faithful?
               But now in what thinges doo the ſaintes communicate? They communicate in good and euel. For all thinges be to all men, as the ſacrament of the ſupper of the Lorde repreſenteth the ſame to vs, in bread & wine, where wee bee called by Saint Paul one onely body, one bread, and one drink. For who is he that can offend or hurt the leaſt part of our body: but by and by he greeueth the whole body in the ſame? Who may ſuffer the leaſt prick in our toe, but all the body wilbe greued with the ſame? What

good is doone to the foote, but all the body wil reioyce? Euen ſo are wee all one body, for all that one ſuffreth: I ſuffer alſo, and what ſoeuer good is doone to one, is doon to my ſelf. For who can take any part or porcion of the bread or ſupper of the Lorde how little ſo euer it bee, to whome it may not be ſaid that he hath receaued the Lordes ſupper? Who is he that dooth deſpiſe the leaſt porcion of the bread: the whiche likewiſe may not be ſaide that he hath deſpiſed the holy communion or ſupper? Wherefore if wee be angred, if we ſuffer, yea if we dy, caſt our eyes vpon this, and beleeue firmly, be wee certaine that it is not wee that be ſadde or heuy, or that doo ſuffer, or that doo dy, no we be not alone: but Jeſus Chriſte and his Churche ſuffreth with vs. So is it that Jeſus Chriſte hath willed that the way of death ſhould bee to vs comfortable and that we ſhould paſſe ouer all our miſeries by the ſame the whiche all

mē haue in horrour and be afraid of. But now wee entring into the way of the paſſion and of the death, hauing all the Churche to accompany vs, and the Church dooth ſuffer more conſtantly then we can our ſelues, ſo that we may truly appropriat & take to our ſelues that whiche Elie ſayde to his ſeruaunt Giezi, whiche was taken with feare in the ſecond, of Kinges the ſixt Chapiter. Feare not for there are more on our ſides then of our ennemies. And after Elie had praied: hee ſaid Lorde yt it may pleaſe thee to open the eyes of this Lad that he may ſe, and then the Lord opened the eyes of Giezi and he ſaw and beholde the mountaine was ful of ſouldiers and of Chariottes round about Elie. And now their lacketh no more to vs, but that wee pray that God wil open our eyes that wee may ſee the Churche or congregation of GOD round about vs, yea the eyes of our faith, & thē ther ſhalbe nothīg ſo horrible

nor fearful that ſhall make vs a fraid, as is ſaid in the. 134. Pſalme. As the hye mountaines are round about him: euen ſo ſtandeth the Lorde about his people from this time forth for euermore.
               Amen.
            
            
               ¶ The ſeuenth Chapiter of the ſeuenth conſideration of the good whiche is aboue vs.
               
                  I Doo not ſpeake of the eternall and celeſtiall goodꝭ, whiche the bleſſed doo enioy, as in a clear light and viſion of God: but rather or at the leaſt I ſpeake of thoſe according to faith, and after the meanes by the whiche theſe thinges may bee comprehended of vs. Alſo this ſeuenth conſideration is Jeſꝰ Chriſt the king of glory, riſing from death. For as we reade in the ſeuenth conſideration of euelles, he ſuffred, died, &

was buried: ſo heerewe may beholde ye ſouerein īeſtimable ioy of our hartꝭ and the ſtrength of our felicitie and comfort. The Sonne of God beeing raiſed frō death dieth no more, death ſhall no more reigne nor haue domination ouer him. This is the furnace of Charitie and the fire of GOD in Sion, as ſaith Eſay. For Jeſꝰ Chriſt is born to vs, and not onely ſo: but is alſo geuen to vs, and therfore his reſurrection is mine, and all that he hath accompliſhed by his moſte glorious reſurrection.

               Now what hath hee doone in riſing from death? He hath deſtroyed ſinne, he hath raiſed the righteoꝰ and iuſt, hee hath ſwalowed vp death, he hath brought life, hee hath obtained victory ouer hel, and prepared for vs euer laſting glory.

Chapiter of Geneſis, hearing that his Son Joſeph reigned in Egipt, he as riſing from a deepe and profound dreame: myght not beleeue thoſe whiche tolde him thoſe thinges vntil they ſhewed him the Chariottes with ſtuffe, ſent from Joſeph. Alſo as difficil and hard a thing it is to vs to beleeue yt ſo great goodes is prepared for vs by Jeſus Chriſte, to vs whiche be ſo vnwurthy except he him ſelf doo make vs beleue it by his wurd in many ſure textes & places. And as he did appeere and declare him ſelf to his diſciples, by many apparitions, Alſo he dooth now allure and draw vs to him, as by Chariottes, by long experience and vſage, and this is a Chariot moſte gratioꝰ & louing, that he is made of God to vs righteouſnes, wiſedome, ſanctification and redemption. As Saint Paul ſaith. 1. Corinthians the. 1. Chapiter.

I am a ſinner, but I am borne and lifted vp in his righteouſneſſe which is made mine. I ā filthy ſhameful, and miſerable, but his holineſſe is made to me my ſanctification and my purgation in the whiche I am moſte graciouſly and louingly trained and brought vp. I am fooliſh, but his wiſedome dooth ſuſtaine and bear me. I am wurthy of damnation, but his liberty is my ſufficient raūſome. O Chariot moſte ſure, ſo that ye Chriſtian and faithful perſon (whiche beleueth the ſame) may aſmuche glory and reioyce in all theſe goodes and merites of our Lorde Jeſus Chriſte: as him ſelf had doone them. They be his owne proper, ſo that now he may boldely abide the iudgement of God, the whiche without this is of all men importable. This faith is a thing moſte excellent, for it bringeth to vs ſuche ineſtimable goodes, ſo glorioꝰ, that it dooth conſtitute vs the glorioꝰ Children of God, for wee can not bee

Children, but wee muſt poſſeſſe and obtaine the goodes of our father and the enheritaunce. Now the Chriſtians may boldely ſay, death where is thy victory? O death where is thy ſting? that is to ſay ſinne, for the

                  ing of death: is ſinne▪ and the ſtrength of ſinne: is the lawe. Thankes bee to our Lorde God whiche hathe made vs to obtaine victory by Jeſꝰ Chriſte our Lord, yt is to ſay. The law dooth conſtitute and declare vs ſinners, ſin maketh vs culpable of death and dāp nation. Now who hath vanquiſhed theſe thinges? Is it our righteouſnes? Is it our good life? No truly, it is the Lord Jeſus riſing from death, cō
                  demning death and ſin, making vs partakers of his righteouſneſſe, reſigning to vs his merites, putting his hand vpon vs and taketh vs to him, and fulfilleth the law, and ouercommeth ſinne and death. Now for all theſe thinges, honour, geuing of thankes, and praiſe bee to our good

God for euer and euer. Amen.
               This is the moſte ſouereigne conſideration in the whiche we be all redy ſo by lifted vp, not onely aboue our euelles: but alſo aboue our goodneſſe, and be all ready in poſſeſſion of the goodes of others, gotten by the labor of other, in place where we were couched before in the euells of other, and conquered by the ſinnꝭ of other, and augmented by our owne▪ We be now couched and ſet in the place of the righteouſnes of Jeſus Chriſte, yt whiche is to him righteouſnes, for aſ muche as we are ioyned to hi, which is agreable to God, and as a mediatour dooth intercede & make requeſt for vs and this moſte holy ſacrificator and aduocate is made whole altogether oures.

And he that beleeueth not this: it is to him as one ye tolde him a fable or as to a dum man or one that knoweth not Chriſte, nor what he dooth profite him, nor what vtilitie is in Jeſus Chriſte. Where fore if we had no other meditations or conſiderations but this onely, it were ſufficient to fulfil vs with vnſpeakable conſolation, if it bee diligently conſidered wt an attentife hart, we ſhall not onely be ſorowful for our euelles: but alſo we ſhall glory and reioyce in out tribulations, thorow the great ioy that we haue in our Lord Jeſus, and ſhall ſcantly feele our miſeries and euelles.
