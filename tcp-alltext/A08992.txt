To all ſuch as ſhall intend hereafter to enter the ſtate of Matrimonie, godlily and agreeably to lawes
            
               FIrſt, that they contract not with ſuch perſons as be hereafter expreſſed, nor with any of like degree, againſt the law of God, and the lawes of the Realme.
            Secondly, that they make no ſecrete contracts, without conſent and counſell of their Parents or Elders, vnder whoſe authoritie they bee: contrarie to
Gods lawes, and mans ordinances.
            Thirdlie, that they contract not anew with anie other vpon diuorce and ſeparation made by the Iudge for a time, the lawes yet ſtanding to the contrarie.
            
               MArriage is honorable among all men, and the bed vndefiled. But whoremongers and adulterers God will iudge. Heb. 13.
            To auoide fornication, let euerie man haue his wife, and let euerie woman haue her huſband. He that can not containe, let him marrie: For better it is to
marrie, then to burne. 1. Cor. 7.
            Vnto the married I commaund, not I, but the Lord: Let not the wife depart from her huſband. But if ſhe depart, let her remaine vnmarried, or be reconciled vnto
her huſband. And let not the huſband put away his wife. 1. Cor. 7.

                     None ſhall come neere to anie of the kinred of his fleſh to vncouer her ſhame: I am the Lord.

            1 IT is to be noted, that thoſe perſons which be in the direct line, aſcendent
and deſcendent, can not marrie togither, although they bee neuer
ſo farre aſunder in degrée.
            2 It is alſo to be noted, that conſanguinitie and affinitie (letting and
diſſoluing Matrimonie) is contracted as well in them and by them, which be of kinred
by the one ſide, as in and by them, which be of kinred by both ſides.
            3 Item, that by the lawes, Conſanguinitie and afinitie (letting and diſſoluing
Matrimonie) is contracted as well by vnlawfull companie of man and woman,
as by lawfull mariage.
            4 Item, in contracting betwixt perſons doubtfull, which bee not expreſſed in this
table, it is moſt ſure, firſt to conſult with men learned in the lawes, to vnderſtande
what is lawfull, what is honeſt and expedient, before the finiſhing of their
contracts.
            5 Item that no Parſon, Vicar, or Curate, ſhall ſolemnize Matrimonie out of
his or their cure or Pariſh Church or Chappell, and ſhall not ſolemnize the ſame
in priuate houſes, nor lawleſſe or exempt Churches, vnder the paines of the lawe,
forbidding the ſame. And that the Curate haue the Certificates, when the parties
dwell in diuerſe pariſhes.
            6 Item the bands of Matrimonie ought to be openlie denounced in the Church
by the Miniſter, three ſeuerall Sundayes or feſtiuall dayes, to the intent, that
who will and can alledge anie impediment, may bee heard, and that ſtay may bee
made till further triall, if anie exception be made there againſt it vpon ſufficient
caution.
            7 Item, who ſhall maliciouſlie obiect a friuolous impediment againſt a lawfull
Matrimonie, to diſturbe the ſame, is ſubiect to the paines of the law.
            8 Item, who ſhall preſume to contract in the degrées prohibited (though he doe
it ignorantlie) beſides that the fruite of ſuch copulation may bee iudged vnlawfull,
is alſo puniſhable at the Ordinaries diſcretion.
            9 Item, if anie miniſter ſhall conioyne anie ſuch, or ſhall be preſent at ſuch contracts
making, he ought to be ſuſpended from his miniſterie for three yeeres: and
otherwiſe to be puniſhed according to the lawes.
            10 Item, it is further ordained, that no Parſon, Vicar, or Curate, doe preach,
treate, or expound of his owne voluntarie inuention, anie matter of controuerſie
in the Scriptures, if he be vnder the degree of a maiſter of Art, except he be licenſed
by his Ordinarie therevnto, but onelie for the inſtruction of the people, reade
the Homelies alreadie ſet forth, and ſuch other forme of doctrine as ſhalbe hereafter
by authoritie publiſhed. And ſhall not innouate or alter anie thing in the Church,
or vſe anie old Rite or Ceremonie, which be not ſet forth by publique authoritie.
