               IT is not without a
greate cause (moste

holy Apostle sainct

from their knowlege & vnderstanding,
nor to be troubled

neyther by spirite, neyther by

vndoubtedly did afore se by the
reuelacion of Gods spirit,Mat. xxiiii. that
there should aryse false anoynted
and false preachers, whiche
shoulde worke great miracles
and wonders, insomuch that if
it were possible, the very elect &
chosen people of God shoulde
be brought into errour, whiche
also shoulde saye, beholde here
is Christe, or there is Christe,
bringing in damnable sectes, &
vtterly denyenge the Lord that
bought them,i. Pet. ii. as Peter sayeth.
He considered the imbecillitie,

not here to be rehersed. And
woulde God, that as the name

this monstrous beaste,
are there rysen, not a few, which
are playne Antichristes, & daily
labour to obscure the glory of

that God alone doeth not forgeue

Whiche thinge I take in hāde
the more gladly, because I se y•
thys kynde of doctrine is a
great defacing of Gods glory,
and that it throweth many into
great daūger, forasmuche as
they looke for that at the hand
of man, whiche onely is the gift
of God, yea, it encourageth not
a fewe to lyue dissolutely, and
without the feare of God, seyng
they are perswaded, that if the
Prieste layeth his hande ones
vpon their head, and saye Ego
absoluo te, they are quyte delyuered
of their synneful burden,
and though they returne streyght

what skylleth it? Ego a

it, that the Lorde alone remitteth

a pena et culpa. This was
godly doctrine in the olde testament,
neyther was he counted
of godly mē any Heretyke that
taught this kynde of learning
at that tyme. God was thā the
Lorde alone omnisufficient for
all hys people that truly repented
and conuerted to his vnmesurable

nede at that tyme of any other
to be conioyned with hym, as
he hym selfe sayde vnto Abraham,Gene. xv.
feare not Abraham, I am
thy defender and thyne altogether
sufficient rewarder, and is
the Lordes hande nowe so abbreuiated
and shortened,Esa. lix. that

he can saue nomore? or is hys
eare so stopped that he can not
heare? Lorde God, what a so
                  •
               ē
chaunge is this? But I stedfastly
beleue, that he is thesame
Lorde now, that he was in the
olde tyme, and of no lesse power
to remit sinne at thys present,
than he was many thousande
yeres before these oure
dayes, in asmuche as he abydeth
euer one, and is not chaū
               geable,
as he sayeth by the Prophet
Malachie,Malac. iii. I am the Lord
and am not chaunged.
            ¶Hytherto haue I bene holde
in few wordes to proue, y• in the

forgaue the synnes of his people
without the helpe, eyther of
Bishop, Prophet, prieste, leuite
or any other, yt the whole glory
of their saluacion might be ascribed
to hym alone. Nowe let

vs also labour to declare, that
God alone doth the very same
thynge in the new testament, y•
he alone maye stil remayne the
God of health agaynst the pestilent
doctrine of the wicked
Papistes, whiche so borishelye
sweate to maintaine their vsurped
power, and fayned authoritie

that when a certen man beyng

Scribes hearing these wordes
of forgeuing sinne, thinking wt
thē selfs y• Christ was not God,
but mā onely, & that it was the

office of God alone too remit &
forgeue synne, spake on thys
manner within them selfs. Hic
blasphemat, this felow blasphemeth,Marc. ii.
or as Marke & Luke writeth,Luce. v
Who is he y• speaketh blasphemies?
Who is able to forgeue
sinne but God alone? here
the Scribes tēdering more the
glory of God then our papistes
& pharises do at this time, could
not abyde y• Christ, whome they
iudged only mā, should chalēge
to him power to forgeue sinne,
seing y• alone pertained to God.
And vpō this place of ye scripture
many write yt y• Scribes erred
not in this cōfession y• God
alone forgeueth synne, but in
this thei sai, thei were deceyued
because thei beleued not, y• christ
was bothe God and man. If
Christe had bene nothinge but
mā, he had blasphemed in dede,

that is to say, taken that thing
vpon hym, whiche is the office
of God alone, but forasmuche
as he was not onely man, but
also God, he blasphemeth not,
he chalenged nothing but that
was hys righte. So did the
Scribes and not Christe blaspheme.
Let all men therefore
learne of this historie, that God
alone forgeueth synne. Doeth
not Christe also in the aforesaid
chapter of Matthew,Math. ix call hym
selfe a Phisicion, and shew that
he came to call synners vnto repentaunce,
and to make them
whole? Why calleth he him self
a phisicion, but because it is his
office to cure and heale?Iere. xvii. Ieremy
prayed vnto this phisicion,
sayeng: heale me o Lorde, & I
shall be healed, saue thou me, &
I shall be safe, for thou arte he
whome I will magnifye. For

he did knowe full well, that all
other phisicions were vnprofitable
without his helpe, and no
more mete to cure sicke conscī
               ces
of them selfes, then the olde
Lyon was to heale the horse, of
whome Esope writeth in his fables,
whiche notwithstandyng
take on him to practise phisicke
whā of that same sciēce he was
altogether ignorante.Math. xi. Moreouer
Christe calleth all them y•
labour and are laden to hym, &
promiseth that he will refreshe,
ease and conforte them. He sendeth
them not awaye to other,
but calleth them all withoute
excepcion to hym, whereby he
sheweth that no creature, neyther
in heauen nor in earth can
truly and sufficiently heale our
infirme and sicke consciences,
but he alone,Ioan. x
                     •
                  . whiche sayeth, I
am the resurrectiō and lyfe. He

that beleueth in me, althoughe
he be dead, shal lyue, and euery
one that liueth and beleueth in
me, shal neuer dye. For who can
forgeue me my synne, but he alone,
which is without al sinne?
Who can deliuer me frō death
& hel,i. Pe
                     •
                  . ii
                     •
                  
                but he alone, which hath
ouercome them both?Ose. xiii. Who cā
make me good, but he alone,
whiche onely is good?Math. xix. Who cā
make me wyse, righteous and
holy, but he alone, which is appoynted
of God the father to be
our wysdome, righteousnes, &
sanctification?i. Cor. 
                     •
                  . Finally, who cā
engraffe in me life & vertu, but
he alone, in whome is all hope
of life and vertue?Eccle. xxiiii Therfore ful
well doth Christ cal so many as
labour and are loden with the
burdē of synne to him,Mat. xi. and promiseth
that he wil refresh them,
that is to saye, absolue and deliuer

them frome their synnes.
Hereto belongeth the sayinge
of blessed Iohan Baptiste,Ioan. i. Beholde
that lābe of God, whiche
taketh awaye the sinne of the
worlde. Here blessed Baptiste
confesseth, that it is Christe alone,
whiche absolueth and taketh
awaye the synne of the
worlde. Doeth not also the
holy Euangelist sainct Iohan
in the aforesayde Chapter call
Christe that true lighte, which
lighteneth euery man that cometh
into this worlde: what other
thinge is it to lighten, thā
too put awaye the cloudes of
synnes, and to sende into oure
hertes the radiante and glisteringe
beames of the eternall
sonne, whiche is the knowlege
of Gods mooste holy will. And
this, sayeth saincte Iohan, is
the office of Christe alone.
            
               Why doth Christe cal so many
as thyrste vnto hym,Esa. iv. & promyseth
that floudes of lyuysh water
shall flowe out of their bellies:Ioan. vii.
yea,

                  poc. xxii. and that he will geue
them the water of life frely▪ but
onely to shewe, that whosoeuer
is thyrsty, and hartely desireth
remission of synnes, muste with

with the Psalmographe, Lyke
as the harte desireth the water
brokes, so longeth my soule after
the, o God. My soule is a
thyrste for God, yea, euen for ye
liuinge God. &c. Furthermore
Christe commaundeth yt repentaunce
and remission of sinnes
shoulde be preached in his name.

Where we may learne, that
forgeuenes of synne cometh
onely by the name of Christe.
And in the Actes of y• Apostles
we fynde, y• when any famous

& notable acte or miracle was
done▪ the people, as manye at
this daye, did ascribe it to the
vertue and power of the Apostles,
willynge to do sacrifice
vnto them for it, but the Apostles
did reiecte and cast awaye
all suche immerited honor and
vndeserued prayse, contendyng
and maynly laborynge to perswade
the people,Act.

                that whatsoeuer
was don, came not to passe
by their power, but by the vertue
of Iesu Christe, whom God
raysed vp from death. And whē
they made mencion of remissiō
of synnes, they did neuer remē
               ber
and reherse their owne power
to forgeue synne, but onely
preached, that so many as beleued
and were baptised into the
remission of synnes, shoulde be
absolued and frely forgeuen by
the name of Iesu Christe. And

in the actes of the apostles blessed
Peter playnly confesseth,Act. x. y•
there is no health, no lyfe, no remission
of synnes, but in Christ
alone, and that there is none other
name geuen vnto mē vnder
heauen, wherein they muste
be saued,Act. iiii. but the name of Iesu
Christe alone. Neyther did the
Apostles absolue any otherwise
than by the preachyng of gods
worde, which whē it was heard
& beleued, than were y• diligent
hearers, and faythful beleuers
of the same truly absolued, as
Christ sayeth. Now are ye clene
for the wordes sake that I haue
spoken vnto you, that is. Now
are ye deliuered frō your sinnes
because ye haue beleued my
preaching.

Where it maye be learned,Roma▪ x. y• if
fayth be not geuen to the worde

there is no absolucion or deliueraūce
frō sinne.Roma. xiii For whatsoeuer
is not of fayth, is sinne, & where
fayth is not, there abydeth the
wrathe of God, as holy Iohan
Baptist sayeth,Ioan. iii he y• beleueth y•
sonne, hath euerlasting life, but
he that beleueth not the sonne,
shal not se life, but the wrath of
God abydeth vpon him.Math. viii ix. xv. Therfore

our righteousnes.Roma. viii. Agayne the
aforesayde Apostle sayeth, that
God hath not onely geuen vs
his sonne, but also all thinges

synnes. So se we y• God alone
absolueth & forgeueth vs oure
synnes for Christes sake. Saīt
Paule to the Galathians affirmeth,Galat. i.
that Christ gaue him self
for our sinnes, that he might deliuer
vs from this present euill
worlde, that is to saye, from all

God alone it is,

vnto y• great shame of all these
Papistes, which cease not with
their stētorous voyces to speke
euill of the true preachers of

Gods worde, and to obscure or
deface the glory of God. Take
away the power of onely remittinge
synnes from God, & what
remayneth there, wherfore we
should confesse our selfs boūde
to hym? I speake of matters
concernynge the saluacion of
our soules. If all that be of the
shauen nacion, haue power to
absolue men of their sinnes at
their pleasure, and to remit or
retayn, whose iniquities it pleaseth
them, than is God wel promoted,

Kytchyn, as they vse to saye.

so many as pleased the priestes
shoulde haue their synnes forgeuen

fle vnto hys mercy? If this be
heresy, whiche we onely confesse
and teache. I coulde allege diuers
sentences out of the holy
doctors of Christes churche,

which maintaine this doctrine.
But seyng I fighte not for the
auauncement of man, but for y•
glory of God, I wil not satisfie
this my worke with mans doctrine,
but with the infallible verite
of Gods word. For I know
that euery man is a lyar,Psal.

                but
God is true,Esa. xl. & hys worde abydeth
for euermore.
            Now will I prepare my self
to the second parte of this treatise,
and afterwarde make aunswer
to the obiecciōs of the aduersaries,
that God maye styll
remayne a glorious God in the
presence of al men, and al other
recoūted duste and ashes in cō
               parison
of hym. The seconde
parte of this treatise is this, as
concernyng the priest, he forgeueth
not the synne, but onely is
a minister of God, appointed to
vtter & declare that fre remissiō
               
of synnes purchased for vs of
God the father, by the most precious
bloude of Iesu Christe.
This maketh the Papistes to
cry, ad ignem, ad ignem. For this
doctrine plucketh them doune
one staffe lower than they were
before. They may now become
no more Checkemate with God.
For before they were not onely
not contented to be his ministers,
but also they woulde be
heylefellow wel mette with hī.
Now shall they be fayne, eyther
to be y• messengers and seruaū
               tes
of God, or els playne Antichristes
and papistes. But let
vs se, what the scripture sayeth.
            That the priest forgeueth not
synne but God alone, it is sufficiētly
proued before. Now must
we learne of y• holy scriptures,
whyther y• priest be but onely a
minister appoynted of God to

vtter & declare y• absoluciō & fre
deliueraūce from synne, or not.
That this is his office, it is manifest
by diuers places of y• new
testamēt. Whā Christ sent forth
his disciples, he sayd vnto them
on this maner: Go into y• vniuersal
worlde, & preache y• Gospel
to euery creatur,Max
                     •
                  . xvi. who so shal
beleue & be baptised, he shall be
saued, but who so wil not beleue
shalbe condēned. Here is it euident
ynough, what authoritie
prestes haue, & what their office
is, verely to preache y• Gospel &
to baptise. Marke y• they must
preache y• Gospell, as s. Paule
sayeth, Christ sent me not onely
to baptise, but to preache y• Gospel.
Again, wo is vnto me,i. Cor. 
                     •
                  . if I
preache not y• Gospel.i. Cor. ix. And in y•
discripsiō of a spiritual minister
he sheweth yt such one ought to
be chosen, as is not onely learned,
but also apte too teache,

able to exhorte with wholsome
doctrine,
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                & to conuince or ouercome
them that speake agaynst
the trueth of Christes gospell.
And sainct Peter sayeth, ye elders
fede the flocke of Christe,
somuche as in you is. What other
thynge is it to preache the
gospel, than to declare vnto the
people, that their synnes be forgeuen
them frely of God, if they
repent and beleue in Christe, as
it is written. He that beleueth y•
sonne, hath euerlasting lyfe.Ioan. iii. If
synnes be forgeuen of God, &
the ministers commaunded to
declare that same to the people
than doth it folowe, that they
forgeue not the synne, but only
are ministers appointed of god
to publishe that benefite of our
saluacion. If a Prince pardonneth
his subiect for hys treason
committed against hys person,

and sendeth hys, letters of fauoure
to the traytoure, by one
of his faythfull seruauntes, cō
               maundynge
him to declare his
pitefull mercy to the gilty, who
forgeueth the fau
                  ••
                the messenger
or the kynge? I am sure it
wyll be answered the kynge.
And not vniustly. For y• prince
alone pardoneth, the messenger
only declareth hys princes
pleasure to the traytoure. Euen
so all we haue offended, & worthely
deserued eternall deathe.
Nowe the good pleasure of our
moste mighty prince is to forgeue
vs euen of his owne fre
mercy, without our desertes or
merites for Christes sake, and
that hys vnspeakable goodnes
towarde mankynde maye be
knowen, he hath appoynted his
ministers to publishe it abrode.
The summe of their commissiō
               
is this, that whosoeuer will repente
hys former lyfe & beleue
to haue remissiō of their sinnes
thorowe the mercye of God in
Iesu Christ our Lord, they, shal
be forgeuen. The ministers of
God publish these ioiful newes
exhorte vnto repentaunce and

Doth not saint Paule, Iames,
Peter, and Iude, call thē selfs
the seruauntes of Iesu Christe
in all their Epistles, declaringe
therby, that they are not the self
master, by whome remission &
absolucion of synnes cometh,
but onely the ministers of him,
whiche infundeth and poureth
into all men grace, fauoure, remission
of synnes and euerlastyng
lyfe? there is but one master,
that is to saye,Mat. xxiii. Christe, the
other are seruauntes, as saynct

Paule witnesseth, We preache
not our selfes, but Christe Iesu
the Lorde,ii. Cor. iiii. and we your seruaū
               tes
for Iesus sake. Agayn, let a
man this wyse esteme vs, euen
as the ministers of Christ, and
stewardes of y• secretes of God.i. Cor. iiii.
All these textes declare manifestlye,
that priestes, if they be
true ministers, and not rather
idolles, are nothinge but ministers
and seruaūtes appoynted
of God to declare vnto the christen
congregacion, that fre remission
of synnes cometh vnto
vs from God alone, thorow the
glorious name of Iesu christe,
so farre is it of, that the priestes
contrary to their commission cā
forgeue synnes, whose office cō
               sisteth
in declaring, and not in
geuinge remission of sinnes.
            Therfore let theim be contēted
nomore frō hensforth arrogātly

to arrogate yt vnto them, which
pertayne to God alone. but hū

the synne, and that they
are but commissioners, appointed
of God, to publishe and setforth
the same, I meane the remission
of synnes geuen to the
faythfull penitēt of God alone.
Neyther let theym frowne at
thys doctrine, whiche setteth
them in their righte place, but
rather (as it becometh good &
faythfull seruauntes) let theim
geue the glory of our saluaciō
to God alone, and be glad that
they are called vnto so worthy
& honorable office to declare the
misteries of God to the people,
whose preachinges or sermōs,
whosoeuer beleueth, may be so
certenly assured of y• remissiō of

of y• papistes, & briefly confute

saying of Christe, loosen hym &
let him go away.Ioan. xl. Agayn, loosen

simple poore shyfte too proue
their absolucion, whan thei are
cōpelled to fle vnto y• vnteiyng
of a vile shete, and loseninge of
a simple rude Asse. Loke whersoeuer
the papistes fynde any
worde that cometh of this verbe
Soluo, that maketh for absoluciō
streyght wayes. I maruel
how this escaped theym,Math. xviii.

Solue regina, as some of theim

pronounce it, they wolde not
haue bene ashamed to haue alledged
it for absolutiō, euen as
some of the papistes do, which,
where so euer they fynde, Ignis,
take it for Purgatory streyght-wayes.
O noble doctors of
Tyrology, rather than of Theology.
            As concerning the first text,
which is that Christ commaunded
that Lazarus should be let
loose, and suffered frely to go
hys waye, if they will gather
their absolucion of that, it may
than be proued, y• all other men
and womē haue that same power
so well as they. For there
were at that tyme present, not
onely the disciples of Christe,
but also diuers Iewes with certeyn
women, whiche I am sure
were not all priestes. Haue they
not made a good market? they

haue brought a shillinge to .ix.
pens, yea, rather to nothynge.
            They haue done fayre by them
selfes by my fay. Whyle thei laboure
to make them selfs goddes,
& to excell all other in dignitie,
they go so wisely to worke
that they haue made them selfs
equal to the mooste inferioure.
O crafty dawbers. Whiche of
them all is able too proue that
Christ spake these wordes, loosen
hym and let hym go, rather
to his Disciples than to all the
other indifferently? I thynke
rather that he spake them to y•
women, as mooste comonly occupied
aboute suche thinges.
But to whom he spake, the text
maketh no menciō, therfore cā
they proue nothyng.
            As touchyng the losoningeMath. xxi.
of y• Asse, who seeth not their folishnes?
the occasion why christ

sente the disciples for the Asse,
was not to geue theym power
to losen men from their sinnes
at their pleasure, but to fulfil ye
prophecy of zachary, whiche so
lōge before prophecied y• Christ
shoulde come rydynge mekely
vpon an Asse, contrarye to the
expectacion of the ambicious &
vayne glorious Iewes. What
is this to the purpose? Where
as Christ by this example teacheth
humilite, the papistes gather
pryde.ii. Thes. iii Christe submitteth
hym self, euen with the mooste
lowest, and they exalt thē selfs
with the mooste hyghest, yea, aboue
all that is called God or
that is worshypped, and syt in
the temple of God, and shewe
them selfes as God. Tell me
good Reader, are not these swete
Allegorymakers? I woulde
they woulde ones cease to moralyse,

for they haue lyed too
longe.
            Some of them also alledge
this sayinge of Christe, Whatsoeuer
thou shalt bynde on the
earth, shalbe also boūde in heauē.
And whatsoeuer thou shalt
loosen on earthe, shall be loosoned
in heauen. Here they esteme
them selfes more thā Goddes.
By this texte, they thynke
they maye do, whatsoeuer pleaseth
theym, saue or condemne,
bynde or loose, holde vp or cast
doune, buylde or subuerte, brīg
to heauen or caste doune to hel,
but if the good men woulde
take the paynes to looke what
goeth before, theyr cōbe should
sone be plucked doune, they
wold not make somuch of their
paynted shethe. Christ sayeth a
littel before, I will geue y•, the
keyes of y• kyngdom of heauē.

He sayeth not, I geue y•. Christ
in this place onely promised y•
keyes to the congregacion, and
performed his promise after his
resurreccion, as we maye se in y•
Gospel of Ihon. Hereof maye y•
papistes rightwell perceyue, y•
this texte, wherof hytherto they
haue so greatly gloried, and out
of the whiche they haue sucked
so greate aduauntage, maketh
littel vnto the aduauncemēt of
theyr fayned power.
            Their laste and moste strōg
bulwarke,Ioan. xx. where y• keyes were
geuen to the true ministers, is
this text, Whosoeuer synnes
ye forgeue, they are forgeuen
vnto them. And whosoeuers
synnes ye retayne, they are retayned.
Here they triumphe &
perswade themselfes, that they
haue gottē the victory, though
they neuer fight stroke. But if

they will be fauorable to God,
and worke no iniurie to the other
scriptures afore rehersed,
they shall haue no cause to lifte
vp their bristles. Christe speaketh
here after the manner of
our speache, whiche diligently
must be noted, vnles we wil depriue
God of his glorie. Whan
we se a man restored to his healthe,
whiche longe before hathe
ben vexed of some greuous disease,
& is made whole thorowe
the diligence of some Phisicion
we vse to saye, Doctor Turner
made this mā whole, or doctor
Byll, or some other, whiche is
expert in that kynde of science,
and yet is it not the doctor that
made hym whole, but rather ye
emplastures and medecines y•
he ministred vnto hym, yea, rather
god, if we wil speake truly
which gaue such vertue to hys

creatures to worke health vnto
the sicke. So doeth the scripture
speake. Somtyme it attributeth
our health to the ministers
of the worde, as in thys aforesayde
place, somtyme and
moste comōly to God hym self,
as we tofore haue abundantly
hearde, & somtyme to the worde
of God,Ioan. xv as it is written. Nowe
are ye clene for the wordes sake
which I haue spokē vnto you,
Itē,Sapi. xvi. Neyther herbe nor emplasture
hathe healed thē, but thy
worde, o Lord, y• healeth al thinges.
Hereto pertaineth ye saying
of ye Psalmographe,Psal. e. vii he sent his
worde, & healed thē, & deliuered
thē frō their destruccions, and
yet doeth God onely make vs
whole, & forgeue vs our sinnes
as he himself witnesseth by the
Prophet,Ose. xiii. saying, thy destrucciō
o Israel cometh of thy self, only

of me cometh thy helpe & saluacion.
What cā be more plainly
spoke? Who is able once to hiske
against these thinges? Who
wil once opē his mouth to barcke
agaist this doctrine? Nomā
I suppose, except he be altogether
drouned in papisme. This
therfore is the true meaning of
thaforesayd text. Whā soeuer y•
ministers of y• Lordes worde declare
vnto me y• swete promises
of God y• father made to me in
Christes bloud,Note. & I beleue thē,
thā are my sinnes forgeuen me
at y• very instaūt, but if I do not
beleue thē, than are my synnes
retayned, y• is to saye, not forgeuē.
And forasmuch as I eyther
repēt & beleue, or els cōtinew
still in myne olde dānable
state, at the preaching of y• Lordes
ministers, therfore y• scripture
attributeth my deliueraūs

from synne or otherwyse to thē,
whan notwithstandynge God
alone remitteth my synne, if I
repent and beleue. If I do not,
the vncircumcision of my hert,
that is, my incredulitie and vnfaithfulnes
is the occasion that
my sinnes are retained and not
forgeuen. For thys sayinge alwaye
muste nedes avyde true,
thy destrucciō, o Israel, cometh
of thy selfe, onely of me cometh
thy helpe and saluacion. So yt
the priestes (I meane the ministers
of Gods worde) are counted
to forgeue synne, whan they
preache to the truly repentaūte
remission of synnes thorowe
Christe, and to retayne synne,
whan they declare too the vnfaythfull
damnacion, and that
the wrath of God abydeth vpō
them, so long as they remayne
still in their incredulitie and

vnfaythfulnes, as it is writtē,
He that beleueth not on y• sonne

Iesu Christ, and hath geuē vs

For God was in Christ, &
reconciled the worlde vnto him
self,ii. Cor. v. and imputed not their sinnes
vnto them, and among vs
hath he set vp the worde of attonement.
Now then are we messengers

to the Galathians he writteth
on this manner, Ye did not

despyse nor abhorre me, but receyued
me as an Aungell of

Hereto pertayneth hys saying
to the Thessalonians,i. Thes. iiii. He that
casteth awaye vs, casteth not

For what are we? Youre murmurīgs
are not against vs, but
agaynst the Lorde. So likewise
reade we in the Gospell,Math. x.
that the Lord spake of hys ministers,
Uerely, verely I saye
vnto you: He that receyueth,

despyseth

               e, despyseth hym

that the ministers of Goddes
woorde, are not to be despysed,
for they are necessarye instrumentes
vnto the health of men
and they are worthy of double
honoure, as the Apostle sayeth.
Therefore maye it be concluded
that the absolucion of thei. Timo. v.
Prieste is not too be despysed,
seynge it is none other thynge,
if it be a true and Christen absolucion,
than the preachynge
of fre remission of oure synnes
in Christes name.

their sayinge, and it
shal vndoubtedly come to passe
according to their preachinge.
So that whatsoeuer the minister
of Gods worde sayeth, accordynge
to the worde of God,
ought to be receyued wt greate
reuerence, and takē as an oraele,
sent doune from heauen, &
vndoubtedly beleued, as a manifeste
and infallible veritie
of God. And this preaching of
remittyng or retaynyng sinnes
are the keyes of the kyngdome
of heauen, which Christ promysed
his Apostles before hys
death, as we maye se in Matthew,Math. xvi.
and after hys resurrectiō
performed hys promyse, as we
rede in the Gospel of saint Iohan.Ioan. xx.
And by a Metaphore
Christ calleth the preachyng of
his worde a keye. For as a keye
hath twoo properties, one too

shutte, another to open, so hath
the worde of God. It openeth
to the faythfull the treasure of
the giftes of God, grace, mercy,
fauou
                  •
               e, remission of synnes,
quietnes of conscience, & euerlastyng
life, but to the vnfaithfull
it shutteth all his treasures,
and suffereth thē, to receiue
none of them all, so lōg as they
persiste and remayne in theyr
incredulity and vnfaithfulnes.
These keyes are geuen too so
many, as beynge truely called
vnto the office of ministracion,
preache y• worde of God. They
loosen, that is to say, they preache
to the faythfull remissiō of
synnes by Christe. They also
bynde, that is, they declare to y•
vnfaythfull damnacion. But
he y• preacheth not the woorde
of God,Note. can neyther bynde nor
loose, though he chalēge neuer

so great dignitie, authoritie &
power. For Christ calleth it the
keye of knowlege.Luc. xi. And the Prophet
sayth, y• lyppes of a Priest
kepe knowledge, and at hys
mouthe shall they requyre the
lawe, for he is the Aungell or
messenger of the Lorde of hoostes.Malach. ii
Therefore where there is
no k
                  ••
               wlege, there is no keye.
And where there is no keye,
there is neyther openynge nor
shuttinge, that is, neyther byndynge
nor loosonynge. Here
let all menne iudge what is to
be thoughte of the Papistes
absolucion, whereof they crake
so muche, whiche also they sell
derely. If no remission of
synnes cometh from them, but
by preachynge Gods woorde,
it foloweth that their absolucion
auayleth but littel, seyng
they neuer preache, neyther the

lawe of God, nor the swete promyses
of hym, but onely mumble
a fewe woordes in the latin
tonge, yea, and this is not vnderstanded,
so likewise many tymes
contrarye too the diuine
scriptures, and ye glory of god.
Miserable doub
                  •
               les is that cō
               gregacion,
which hath a blynd
guyde to their Curate, whiche
hath neyther the gyfte nor the
knowledge of preachynge.Mark. xv. For
if the blynde leadeth the blynd
both falle into ye dyche. Agayn,
greately fortunate is that Paryshe,
and hyghly blessed of
God, to whome a learned shepeheard
hath chaunced, which
can feede them wyth knowlege
and doctrine. Whatsoeuer
they shall heare of suche a learned
and godly minister, lette
theym beleue it as a voyce comynge
doune frome heauen.

And so ofte as by suche a shepeharde
remission of synnes in ye
bloude of Christe is preached
vnto the congregation, let thē
esteme that preachinge none otherwyse,
than if the Lord hym
self had preached it. Let them
stedfastly beleue the woorde of
God, and vndoubtedly by their
fayth th
                  •
               row the grace of God,
they shall obtayne remission of
all theyr synnes. Contrariwise,
i
                  •
                they beleue not, their synnes
are retayned and by no meanes
forgeuen. These thinges haue
I spoken, concernyng the abs
                  •
               
               l
                  •
               cion
or the keyes, which consisteth
only in preaching Gods
worde, that the Papistes maye
haue no occasiō, iustly to barke
agaynst me, as they haue done
hytherto both for my sermons
and bkes. God forgeue them,
and sende them a better mynde.

Nowe, forasmuche as the true
and Christen absolution is nothing
els but the preachinge of
fre deliueraunce from synne, by
y• death of Iesu Christ, it ought
not to be contemned and despised,
but rather to be receiued wt
great humilitie and reuerence,
euen as a diuine oracle, sente
doune from the father of lightes.
For no mā cā expresse,Iaco. i. how
greatly it conforteth infirme &
weake consciences, whiche are
troubled with y• feare of Gods
iudgementes. Whan the Prophet
Nathan came vnto kyng
Dauid,ii. Reg. xi
                     ••
                  
                and rebuked hym for
sleyng Urias the Hethite, & for
takīg his wyfe Bethsabe vnto
hys wyfe, and tolde hym howe
greatly God was angrye with
hym, and what plages shoulde
fall vpon hys house, yea, vpon
hym selfe for hys wickednes, it

is not to be doubted, but that
Dauid was stryken with a wō
               derfull
great heuynes, and his
hert pearsed with an inwarde
sorowe, insomuche that he was
righte ashamed of hym selfe, of
his faulte, of his wickednes, &
was cōpelled euen of consciēce
to braste out into the knowlege
of hys synne, & to saye, I haue
synned agaynst the Lorde. As
Dauid was now full of sorow,
griefe, trouble, disquietnes in
his hert, & had ioye of nothing
(vnto suche shame and confusion
was he broughte in hys
conscience) so likewyse it is not
to be doubted, but that he was
wonderfully reuiued, maruelouslye
restored vnto the peace
and quietnes of his conscience,
yea, and plenteously replenisshed
with ioye in hys mynde,
whan the Prophet sayde these

wordes vnto hym: The Lorde
hath put away thy synne, thou
shalt not dye.Luc. vii. Mary magdalen
was a famous synner, & whan
she herde her vnclene conuersacion
rebuked by the woorde of
God, she hertely repented, and
was replenished wt an inwarde
sorow, lamenting greatly, that
she had offended so bounteous
a Lorde & mercifull God, insomuche
that a large fountayne
of teares folowed out of her tē
               der
eyes. All this tyme vndoubtedly
her sorow was greater thā
it can be here expressed. But
whan she herde this confortable
absolucion of our sauioure
Christe, Remittūtur tibi peccata.
Thy synnes are forgeuen the.
Again, thy faith hath made the
safe Go thy way in peace, that
is to saye, wyth a quiete and
mery conscience. O good God,

who is able to expresse wt howe
great ioye and singular solace
she was affected? So sure and
confortable is it to weake and
troubled consciences too heare
the swete and confortable wordes
of our fre deliueraunce frō
the greuous burden of 
                  •
               ynnes
by Christes bloude.
                  
                     〈◊〉
                  . xxiii. The thiefe
was full of great anguysh and
trouble in his conscience, whan
he hanged vpon the crosse in y•
time of Christes passion, & confessed
that both he & hys felowe
thefe suffered worthely, euen according
to their desertes, and in
the middes of his troubled conscience,
he cryed vnto the Lord
Christe on this maner, sayeng:
Lorde remember me, whā thou
comest into thy kyngdom. But
whan Christ had made him aū
               swere
and sayde, Uerely I saye
vnto the, this day shalt thou be

wyth me in Paradyse, O wyth
what a quiet consciēce suffered
he hys paynes, and with howe
gladde an hert yelde
                  •
                he vp his
spirit into the hādes of the eternal
father? So confortable a
thynge is it to a troubled conscience,
for to heare any thynge
that maye quiet it. Agayn whā
blessed Peter preached vnto the
Iewes and tolde thē,Act. ii. that they
had crucifyde Christ the Lord,
the scripture sayeth, that they
were pricked in their hertes, &
sayde vnto Peter and vnto y•
other Apostles: Ye mē and brethren,
what shall we do? Peter
sayde vnto them: Repent & be
baptised euery one of you, in y•
name of Iesus Christ for the remission
of synnes, and ye shall
receyue the gifte of the holye
Ghoste. As they were greatly
dismayde, whā the holy Apostle

opened vnto theim their malicious
fact, in sleayng Christ the
Lorde, so were they very much
conforted, whan they hearde of
sainct Peter, yt there was hope
of theyr synnes to be forgeuen,
so that they repented theym of
their wickednes, and were baptised
in y• name of Iesu Christ.
With how entier and vnspeakeable
sorow is it to be thought,
that the famous and notable
adulterer amōg the Corinthians
was ouerwhelmed,Cor. v. whā
at y• cōmaūdemēt of s. Paule he
was deliuered vnto sathā, excō
               municate,
put out of the christē
company, and reputed among
them as an Ethnycke & Publicane?
Contrariwyse, with
what excedyng ioye was he replenished,
whan after hys repentaunce
and sorowe he heard
the swete promyses of Goods

mercy declared vnto hym, that
lygheth bent oute towarde all
synners that repent in faythe,
and afterwarde was receyued
into the company of the faythfull
Christianes?ii. Cor. ii. I passe ouer
diuers other histories, bothe of
the olde and newe testamente,
whiche do abundantly declare,
what great conforte the faythful
penitēt synners haue alway
had in hearing the confortable
promises of Gods mercy. Now
the absolucion beyng, as I said
before, nothynge elles but the
preachynge of fre deliueraunce
from synne, by the death of Iesu
Christ (for God alone forgeueth
synne and absolueth the
faythfull penitent) it ought not
to be contemned and despysed,
but whansoeuer the Mynyster
of the Lordes woorde, be it
priuatly or openly, shall reherse

vnto 
                  •
               en, the swete and confortable
wordes of Gods mercye,
towarde all them that repent
in fayth, they oughte too
geue earnest fayth vnto them,
beynge vndoubtedly perswaded,
that their synnes at that
time be assuredly forgeuen thē,
                  
                     〈…〉
                  .
as thoughe God hym selfe had
spoken these wordes, according
to this saying of Christ, he that
heareth you, heareth me. But it
were expedient, that al true ministers
should praye that their
forme or manner of absolucion
be pure and agreable to y• vayn
of the holy scriptures, without
the intermixtion of anye mans
authoritie, in remittinge synne
eyther of Peter, Paule, Fraunces,
Dominike, Benet, or anye
other, or yet of thē selfs, agayn
y• it be declared to the penitent
that God alone forgeueth the

synne, and that the Priestes are
but the ministers of God, too
whome he hath geuē the keyes
of the kyngdome of heauen for
to shewe to y• true penitent loosoning,
that is to saye: remissiō
of their synnes, to the obstinate
and hardeharted synners byndyng,
that is, that they remayn
still in the daunger of damnacion,
and shalbe damned, except
they repent & beleue. It wolde
also be prouided, that whan the
faythfull penitent is desirous
to haue hys conscience confyrmed,
stablished and conforted
with the worde of God, it shuld
not be mūbled in the latin tōge
as the Papistes haue hytherto
vsed in their absolucions, but
in the mother tounge, that the
Idiote and vnlearned may vnderstande
it and be edifyed. Or
els what fayth shall he cōceyue

in hys herte? Howe shall he repent?
How shall he knowe the
goodnes of God towarde synners?
Howe shall he arme hym
selfe with fayth agaynst sathā,
synne and desperacion? Howe
shall he prepare hym selfe too
geue God thākes for his kindnes,
and lyue worthy of his profession?
God graūt that al thinges
maye be done vnto hys
glory, & vnto the profit of hys
holy congregacion.
            Here hast thou (moste godly
Reader) my mynde, concerning
the absolucion and forgeuenes
of synnes, which if it be examined
by the scriptures of God, al
mannes doctrine set aparte, I
doubt not, but it will stande so
stronge, that the gates of hell
shall not once be able too preuayle
agaynst it. Farewel most
gentle Reader, and praye that

the Lordes woorde maye haue
fre passage, that y• name of the
great God, and our sauiour Iesu
Christe maye be glorified amonge
all nacions, and that al
discension layde asyde, we may
agree in one faythe and one
truthe.
