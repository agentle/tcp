            TO THE MOST HIGH,
MOST MIGHTY, AND MOST
Excellent Soueraigne Princesse ELIZABETH,
by the Grace of GOD Queene of England,
France, and Ireland, Defender of
the Faith, &c.
            
               
                  COnsidering (most sacred, and most
mighty Princesse) that the duety of euery
Subiect is, not onely to obey, but also to the
vttermost of his power, in his degree and
qualitie, to aduance the Honour of his
Prince and Countrey; I haue according to
my poore talent endeuoured, in discharge
of my duetie, for the place of Seruice which
I holde vnder your Maiestie, by your
most Gracious fauour, to frame these Discourses
concerning Armes, Honor, and the Princely Magnificence
of your Maiesties Court, a subiect proper to Armorists, and men of my
profession, not handled heretofore in our English by them, or any other to my
knowledge: Yet fit to be knowen of all Noble and worthy personages, being
perswaded that as your Maiestie hath bene a Mirrour to all the world
for excellent gifts of Minde, Person, and Fortune: So your Raigne most
happie both for victorious Armes and flourishing Arts, which shall remaine
glorious to all posteritie, may haply receiue some Honourable note from
hence, which I most heartily desire, as the chiefest scope of my dessein.
            And so most humbly beseeching your Maiestie to vouchsafe that your
poorest Seruant may in all duetie, and humble deuotion prostrate himselfe,
and his Labours, at your most Sacred feete, I beseech the Almightie
God to graunt your Maiestie to exceede all other Princes in
length of life, in perfect health, in prosperous
Raigne, and all felicitie.
            
               Your Maiesties

                  THE principall markes whereat euery mans endeuour in
this life aimeth, are either Profit, or Honor; Th'one proper to vulgar
people, and men of inferior Fortune; The other due to persons
of better birth, and generous disposition. For as the former by
paines, and parsimony do onely labour to become rich; so th' other
by Military skil, or knowledge in Ciuill gouernment, aspire to Honor,
and humane glory: whereof this Booke chiefly entreateth, and
enformeth all Gentlemen and Souldiers, not onely what commendations and prizes belong
to valorous desert, but likewise what penalties and punishments appertaine to disloyaltie,
and Armes abused. Therewith also is discoursed what dignities, and honourable
degrees, accompany Martiall merit; What order hath bene obserued in publique
Combats, and princely Triumphes, both ancient and moderne; What places are due to
Noble personages, aswell men as women; And to some others also according to their sex,
age, Office, or place of Seruice, with diuers other things, whereof worthy Gentlemen desire
to be enformed. This worke with much labour compiled, and not without great
cost and care now Imprinted, is according to order by learned censure allowed, and by the
Honourable approbation of the right Noble Earle of Nottingham, the most ancient,
and most Honorable Commander in Armes of this kingdome, and chiefe Knight of the
Order, fauourably admitted and recommended. The imitation of whose vertue, and
valour, and the excellent actions of other worthy men mentioned in this Booke, may reasonably
incite all yong Gentlemen, to employ their time in study of Morall, and Military
vertue; Thereby, to become seruiceable to their Prince, profitable to their Countrey,
and worthy of all Honourable estimation, and aduancement.

                  CHAP. 1.
                  ¶The Prooeme.
                  
                     FOrsomuch as the life of man
holdeth on a traueilers course continually
as it were vnder saile, either in the
calme of Peace, or the tempestuous sea
of VVarre: it behoueth euery well gouerned
Common weale to bee prepared
for the one and the other. which moued
wise Princes and Magistrates, not onely
to deuise Lawes how men might siue
peaceably, but also to prepare Armes,
both defen siue against forraine inuasion, and correctiue against domestical
insurrection. It therefore seemeth expedient to conioyne good Lawes
vnto Armes: th'one command, th'other to execute: yet because they are
in nature diuers, or rather contrary, it prooueth a matter of much difficultie.
For well we see, betweene equitie and force is no proportion.
Lawes are friends to peace and rest: but war is alwayes accompanied with
men of audatious, sudden, and seuerest spirit. The Philosophers and wise
Lawmakers therfore haue endeuoured more, to make such warres as might
assure peace, then to enioy such peace as might not be able to withstand
warre. Iustinianus desiring to vnite Lawes and Armes, authorised one
Officer to command both Martially and Ciuilly, whom be called Praetor;
and so the Romanes cōtinued that name for their General of warre. His
office was mixed both of authoritie Martial, and Ciuile. It seemeth therefore
that as our bodies cannot without sinowes and blood be strong, so the
warre without ayde of Lawe and equitie may not endure: which mooued
wise men of former ages to be perswaded, that Prudence and Power
ought neuer to be disioyned. Of which opinion the ancient Poet Horace
seemed to be, saying, Vis expers consilij mole ruit sua. The same reason

induced learned writers, to commend valiant Captaines and wise
Counsellors, ioyntly, and (as it were) in one and the selfe same ranke. VVith
Croesus they coupled Solon: with Simonides, Pausanias: Pericles
with Anaxagoras. The Poets likewise in their workes do praise Agamemnon
with Nestor: Diomedes with Vlisses: meaning to mixe
force with policie, and ciuile Lawes with power and Armes. The Kings of
Lacedaemon before they went vnto the warre, did first sacrifice and
consult with the Muses how they were to proceed: for so did Terpander
and Pindarus men of speciall note in Sparta, and which were employed
to set foorth the praises of such of the Lacedaemonians as were both in
Musicke and Armes excellent. The Romanes did highly and openly extoll
Quintus Fabius Maximus, Rollianus, and Pub
                           •
                         Decius, for
their notable knowledge as wel in Armes as learning. Thus doeth it appeare,
that Armes and Lawes cannot bee disioyned: and consequently,
where the counsaile of Captaines is directed by Law, equitie and Religion,
there insolencie, fury, and vnlawfull force is repressed.
               
               
                  CHAP. 2.
                  ¶Militarie Iustice and the originall thereof.
                  
                     HAuing discoursed what concord ought be
betweene Militarie and Ciuile gouernment, it seemeth
requisite to say, that Militarie Iustice generally
is a Law made by consent of all Nations, the propertie
whereof is to repulse force, and to redresse iniurie.
For who so in defence of his owne person doth resist
force with force, shallbe thought to haue so done iustly.
And albeit bruit beastes do seeme in some sort to
offend, and defend without the aide of wit, and humane forecast, yet because
all they do, is without discourse of reason or election, it cannot be said
that they vse force according to Iustice, but rather mooued by naturall instinct,
consequently attempt without order, or warrantie of any lawful proceeding,
which indeed liueth onely among men. For admit that no Lawes
were, and all things left subiect to Fortune and chance, yet such is the force
of equitie and reason, and the root thereof so firmely fixed in the minds of
men, as though neuer so much defaced & obscured in sauage and degenerate
natures, may not yet vtterly be razed out of the mindes of any, be they
neuer so outrageous, but that at one time or other, either openly to the
world, or inwardly to themselues, will they, nill they, some vigorous and
liuely sparkes thereof will appeare. The like may be particularly said of Iustice

Militarie, whereof in the minds of Souldiers so deepe an impression is
made, as no force or time can raze it out. And touching the execution of
Iuridiction Militarie, we say the same was euer performed by Iudges and
Magistrates thereunto purposely appointed, and that men of Armes and
all other Souldiers were in al Militarie matters, directed, punished, & ordered
by their proper Commanders, as in ancient time they were in Rome, and
since in France hath bene vsed. But first, to touch the original of Martial iustice,
it seemeth to haue bene taken from the Romanes, who for causes reasonable,
bestowed vpon men of warte great priuiledges, dignities and immunities,
afterwards confirmed and increased by diuers Emperous. By
whose example some Kings of France, and other princes haue done the
like. Yet true it is, that at the beginning, such iurisdiction was executed onely
in the field, by the Tribunes, or their deputies, I meane in ordinary offences,
or els by the Legate in their absence, or els by the Consul or Generall,
in causes capitall, and faults of most importance. But in processe of time,
the insolencie of Souldiers increasing, the sayd iustice became more generall,
and the authoritie thereof extended into all townes and places whatsoeuer,
inflicting exemplarie punishment according to the qualitie of eche
mans offence, yea, in the end the reputation of Martial iurisdiction became
equall to that of ciuill Iustice.
               
               
                  CHAP. 2.
                  ¶Of Warre, and causes thereof.
                  
                     CIcero sayth, that discord and dissention among men, is ended
either by persuasion or force: the one proper to men,
the other to brute beasts: and where the first cannot
preuaile, the other may be excused. Reasonably therefore
are those warres to be taken in hand, where iniurie
can not be otherwise repulsed, nor peace by other meane
preserued. And most apparant it is, that nature hath bestowed vpon all
creatures certaine armes or weapons wherewith to defend themselues, and
offend their enemies, yea, whoso obserueth shall see, that ech liuing bodie
is in some sort by nature disposed to make warre: as the calfe, before
his hornes be growen, doth indeuour to offend with his head. The colt
turneth his heeles when his hooues are scarsely hard. The little whelpe,
whose teeth be tender and vnfit to bite, will neuerthelesse do his best to offend
with his lips, Man likewise, of all other creatures least furnished both
for offence and defence, will with all his strength, hands and feet, labour
to resist his foes, as appeareth euen in children, who prouoked to anger, do
spurne and bite; haply moued thereunto with desire of victorie onely. The
same reason inciteth men, both in generall and particular, to contend: so
as one citie maketh warre against another, one prouince inuadeth another,
and whole kingdomes and common weales doe endeuour to oppresse one

the other. Yea, the affections in euery sole body, do (among themselues)
str
                        •
                     ue and make warre; which mooued some Philosophers to say, That no
victorie is woorthier of commendation then that wherein man doth conquer
himselfe. Fortior est qui se, quàm qui fortissima vincit moenia: nec virtus
altior ire potest, sayeth Ouid. Seeing then that each man hath warre within
himselfe, and against others, and cities contend for honor and empire, one
taking from the other, what can be sayd Ours, more then that, which is
gotten and defended by armes? Yet true it is, that some warres are not properly
so called; as where one part of the people doth assault the other: for
that kinde of contending ought be named sedition: but when one Nation
taketh Armes to offend an other, there wee say is warre. When the Romanes
were diuided, one faction labouring to oppresse another, (who by
nature ought to haue ioyned together) such enimitie was called Sedition:
but when the Galls, the Carthagenians, or other forreigne people assaulted
the Romanes, or were by them assailed, that contention was truely called
Warre. But omitting to say more of ciuil or domesticall dissention, let vs
discourse of that Warre which is ordinarily made with forreine people, for
Empire and glory, as when the Romanes tooke Armes against the Latines,
Sabines and Carthaginenses, or when they fought with the Celtiberi and Cimbri,
not who should command, but who should liue: yet ought the cause
whereof the Warre groweth be iust, and such as the enemie cannot but acknowledge
reasonable. For who is so impudent as will deny that if iniury
be done, or the goods or honour of other men be taken, but hee from
whom the same was taken, is iustly caused to become an enemie? Non licet
cum alterius incommodo suum augere commodum. Yet Aristotle proueth that
some men are by nature borne to command, others to obey, whereof may
be inferred, that Warres are necessary as well to compell those to subiection
that are destenied thereunto, as also for others (who ought to gouerne)
to hold their auctoritie. The Romanes also did thinke good sometimes to
make Warre onely to entertaine the youth fit for seruice; as when they
sent their Armie vnto Carthage, being perswaded that ouerlong idlenesse
might corrupt. For indeed, the labour and discipline of Warre, doth make
men honest and temperate. It seemeth therefore that Princes martially
disposed, haue not onely thereby purchased renowne, but also much enlarged
their dominions For which reason the Lacedaemonians do seeme to
accuse Pausanias iustly, for inhibiting them to extend the bounds of their
dominion. But contrarywise Lycurgus and Minos are much praised perswading
the Lacedaemonians and the people of Cyprus to aduance their glory,
by Warre: whereof wee may inferre, that Peace is not the onely ende of
Warre: yet not doubt the chiefest and most necessary cause thereof, according
to the opinion of Cicero, saying, Nullum bellum esse iustum, nisi quod aut
rebus repet tis geratur, aut denuntiatum antè sit & indictum. Whereby appeareth
that Warres ought not to be made without iust cause, and publique
expostulation. And Plutarch writing the life of Numa, saith it was not lawful
for a King or any Souldier to take Armes, vntill the Foecials had so commanded
or allowed. Wise Princes and commanders therefore ought to
deliberate maturely before they take Armes, to the ende the Warre may

be iust, and the proceeding thereof aduised. In which point they shall doe
well to imitate the example of Traianus, who vsed to obserue these cautions
viz. carefully to supply the places of Souldiers slaine: couragiously to
represse the enemies pride: and according to discipline Militarie, compell
Muteners to obedience and order. To that purpose also, Octauianus Augustus
did say, No warre ought be taken in hand, vnlesse the same did promise
more hope of profit, then feare of losse. For who so shall otherwise
doe, may be compared vnto a Fisher, that angleth with an hooke of gold,
which being broken, or lost, al the fish hehath gotten, sufficeth not to make
a recompence.
               
               
                  CHAP. 4.
                  ¶Of Souldiers.
                  
                     THat men of warre haue beene anciently called Milites,
euery man knoweth: but for what reason that name was giuen,
euery one is not enformed. We say therefore with Vlpianus,
that men professing Armes, were called Milites à
malitia, idest duritia, which is as much to say, as they were
so named in respect of the hardnesse and danger they indure in defence of
other people, or else because they repulse the euill and iniurie which enemies
doe ofter. Romulus called vnto his guard a thousand men, and some
writers haue thought, that thereof Souldiers were called Milites. Howsoe
                        •
                     er
that were, sure it is that anciently who so would become a Souldier,
it behooued him to procure his name to bee enrolled in the Generals
booke. For necessarie it is, that he who commandeth should know what
number, and so what qualitie his souldiers be. Which reason mooued Alexander
Scuerus to keepe in his chamber a Catalogue or Rolle of his souldiers,
and at his leisure, considered of their suites, their number, their dignities
and wages. Hee likewise cautiously prouided, that no man should
aspire to priuiledges Militarie, by ambition, but for vertue and skill. And
who so desireth to enjoy the honours appertaining to Armes, ought first
to prooue he is a Souldier. In which case the lawes of Cossus, Crassus and
Sceuola must be remembred; for thereby is decreed, that as a man being no
citizen, should not take vpon him to be a citizen, so he that is not enrolled
a souldier, cannot anow himselfe a souldier. By the lawes Ciuill, three
wayes there are for souldiers to proue their profession: which done, they
shall not afterwardes endure any vnworthie or vnreasonable imposition.
The first proofe is by letters & certificate of Captaines or Officers. Charles
the seuenth king of France commanded that no man should be capeable of
charge or office in the warre, vnlesse he were authorised by the Kings letters
and 
                        〈◊〉
                     , in testimonie of the publique honour and degree hee had.

Secondly he ought to make proofe, that in former time he had behaued
himselfe as a good Souldier, and such a one as serued long with commendation.
Lastly, to be recorded among the number of receiued souldiers,
for that testimoniall cannot be disproued. It was also anciently vsed, that
in token of honour due vnto souldiers of good merit, a girdle was giuen;
for it is written in the law Imperiall, Militia exornatos confestimcingi debere.
And Charles the seuenth king of France in his Edict saith thus: Edictum est,
ne quis Miles in numeros referatur, qui non cinctus, sit armis
                           •
                        
                        ▪ it a munitus, vt probum
decet militem. All Souldiers who serued on horsebacke (by the Romanes
called Equites) vsed to carry on their left arme a certaine shield or
buckler, and in the right hand a lance, and vnto their side a Spanish sword
was girded. Thus appeareth it that the girdle was the first Ensigne bestowed
vpon souldiers, and without it no man might accompt himselfe among
the number of militarie men, nor claime the priuiledges due vnto
souldiers. For only they that were inrolled and girded were properly called
souldiers: and they that were newly elected to supply the bands, were
named Tirones. It was also an vse among the Romanes, that when any
Captaine attained this Ensigne of the Generall, he then deliuered a Rolle
or list wherein his number was conteined. By which meanes the Commander
generall might be informed of his whole Armie. It is also to bee
remembred, that besides these inrolled men, doe appertaine to euery armie
certaine supposed souldiers, who are men absent, or not vsed, and neuerthelesse
may enjoy the immunities of the warre: for so was it decreed by
Claudius the Emperous, calling those sorts of Souldiers Militia imaginaria.
                  
               
               
                  CHAP. 5.
                  ¶Howe Souldiers did anciently
take oathe.
                  
                     TO exact an oath of Souldiers was euer thought necessary,
not onely for the Common weale, but also for the Souldier
himselfe. For at such time as Souldiers serued voluntarily,
Lucius Flaccus, and Caius Varro being Consuls, the Senate of
Rome thought fit to compel men of warre to sweare, though
before that time no oath was taken, but at the pleasure of him that would.
Cincius in his first booke de remilitari, affirmeth the oath to be thus: or to
this effect. In exercitu decemquc millia passuum prope, furtum non facies dolo

malo, solus neque cum pluribus. Extra hastam, hastile, ligna, pabulum, vtrem,
follem, faculam, si quid ibi inueneris, sustulerisue, quod tuum non erit, quod pluris
nummi argentei erit, vti ad Consulem Caium Laelium, Luciumue Cornelium, siue
ad quem corum ius erit, proferas: aut profitebere in triduo proximo quicquid inuencris,
sustulerisue dolo malo: aut domino suo, cuius id censebis esse, reddes: Vtine
quid non recte factum esse voles. Wee read also, that long after Petreius forced
the Souldiers of Pompey to sweare they should not abandon their Captaine,
nor Campe; neither should they doe any treason, nor consult one
with another priuately. The like oath was ministred vnto the Souldiers
of Domitianus by Caesar, and they became the more obedient. To which agreeth
that of Polybius, Sc obtemperaturos, & facturos quicquid mandabitur ab
Imperatoribus iuxta vires. Out of Liuie lib. 22. Sese fugae atque formidinis ergo
non abituros, neque ex ordine recessuros, nisit teli sumendi, aut petendi, aut 
                           〈◊〉
                        
feriendi, ant ciuis seruandi caussa. Also Consulis iussu se conuenturos, nec iniussuabituros.
Out of Halycarnasseus Lib. 10. Secuturos se consules, neque signa desertures,
neque aliquid contra populum facturos. These wordes also Scipio sware,
Liuij Lib. 22. Vt ego Rempublicam non deseram, neque vllum ciucm Romanum deserrepatiar.
Si sciens fallo ex animi mei sententia, tum me Iupiter Opt. Max.
domum, familiam, remque meam pessimo laetho afficiat. The oath was taken in
the presence of the whole Legion, by one Souldiour holding his drawen
sword in his hand, and then all the rest seuerally answered drawing their
swords, Idem in me. After vnder the Emperours was added, Se Caesaris salutem
omnibus rebus antelaturos. And they which tooke oath to Iulian the Emperour,
laying their swords to their necks sware, Se omnes pro eo casus quoad
vitam profuderint, si id necessitas exegerit, perlaturos. In the declining state of
the Romane Empire, when Barbarians were enrouled among Romane souldiers,
they were branded with the Emperours marke, and tooke their oath,
Per Deum, & Christum, & Spiritum Sanctum, & per Maiestatem imperatoris
omnia se facturos quae praeceperit Imperator, nec mortem recusaturos pro Romano
Republica. In France also it was anciently vsed that euery Souldier receiued
into any band, or ornified with the girdle Militarie, should be sworne
vnto the King or the general of horse, if he were a horseman; or seruing on
foot, his oath should be taken by the Praetor, or Captaine of footmen. And
so greatly was an oath esteemed, as Caesar procured a Law to be made,
that no Citizen vnsworne, should remaine out of Italy more then three
yeeres. By imitation of which example, the Senate of Rome decreed that
all Magistrates should sweare to answere truely vnto those Interrogatories
that were propounded. The Souldiers of that time did sweare by the
gods; and Radamanthus did thinke that all doubts ought bee decided by
oath. Either else they were to sweare by the winde, & the sword: because the
one was cause of life, th' other of death, for such was the Scythian vse; Or else
by Iupiter, Mars and Pallas; or sometimes by eleuating a Scepter, which
Princes in old time accustomed. But the Christians doe sweare in forme
according to the pleasure of the Prince, the Generall or Chief
                        •
                     aine: but in
matter the oath of Christians is to sweare by the Deitie, As by God, or by
his holy Euagelists, &c.
                  
                     
And here is to bee noted, that if any souldier were absolued from his
othe, yet might he not without the Generals licence, be receiued into any
other Armie: which ordinance was obserued by Constantinus and the ancient
Romanes also. For when Pompilius remained in Prouince, with his
Armie, where the sonne of Cato serued as a Tiro or yong souldier, hee
thought good to discharge that Legion, where the sonne of Cato was. But
he desirous to continue in the warre, did write vnto Pompilius, that if hee
pleased to consent he might remaine there, hee would by anew othe become
bound, because the first othe dispensed with, hee might not fight
with the enemie. And hereof wee may bee also informed by an Epistle
which Marcus Cato the father did write, wherein he commanded his soone
not to beare Armes; for (quoth he) Qui miles non est, cum hoste pugnare non
debet. Thus concluding we say, that souldiers ought be first girded, then
enrolled, and lastly by othe obliged.
               
               
                  CHAP. 6.
                  ¶What sortes of men ought to bee reputed Souldiers,
and who may not bee pressed to
beare Armes.
                  
                     ALbeit the warre is to employ men of diuers qualitie, yet
ought they onely to be reputed Souldiers, that make profession
of Armes. Therefore out of that number, Victualers,
Merchants, Artificers, and generally all men attending their
owne priuate profit, are excluded. Neither ought any of
them be priuiledged by the warre, because such negotiants be occupied in
their owne commoditie, and therefore, as men of base sort, vnworthy to be
numbred among men of warre: because their onely endeuour is to gaine:
which they cannot (nisi admodum mentiantur) we also accompt to aduocate,
procurer, pleader, or perswader to merit the immunitie of warre.
For Claudius the Emperour commanded that euery souldier should (without
counsell) render a reason of his owne life. The Philosophers also
thought those men needlesse in euery common weale: Neither can wee
allowe Ploughmen to bee properly called souldiers, when they are first
pressed to supplie the want of men trained; yet true it is, that in respect
their bodies are accustomed to hardnesse and labour, they become oft
times men of good seruice. And some great Captaines and Generals also,
liuing a rurall life, haue neuerthelesse performed their office with much
glory, as Fabritius, Cincinnatus, and others. Martianus the great doctor
did also reiect bondmen, as persons improper and vnworthy the name of
souldiers, affirming it vnnaturall for him that was not his owne, to serue

any other master then him onely to whom he was bound. And to say truely,
the mind of man vsed to slauery, is base, abiect, and vnapt for the warre:
Yet hath it bene seene, that in times of necessity those men haue bene employed
For we reade how Marcus Antoninus the Emperour, after the warre
of Carthage, trained a great number of slaues, and made them fit for armes,
calling them volones. And Sex
                           •
                        us Pompeius in the ciuil warre of Italy against
the Romanes armed many bondmen. Yet certaine it is, that no slaues were
receiued for souldiers, vntill they had bene enfranchised; and so was it decreed
by Lucius Aemilius Paulus, and Terentius Varro, then Consuls.
                  And for asmuch as the name and dignitie of a souldier is honourable,
all persons hauing committed any infamous crime, and thereof conuicted,
ought not afterwards beare armes. Also because the warre requireth beautie
and force in men, no souldier should bee allowed, that wanteth any
member or limme of his person, which moued the Emperour Domitianus
and Nerua to decree, that no childe should be gelded. And Constantinus
commanded that vpon paine of death no Eunuch should be made, being
perswaded that gelding did take from men the courage and viuacitie required
in warre. Yet was it allowed by the ordinance of the good Emperour
Traianus, that albeit a man were borne with one onely stone, or by anie
mishap did loose it, yet might he by the lawe Militarie beare Armes;
for Silla, and Cotta had naturally that imperfection. Wee conclude therefore
that some fort of Eunuches (but no gelded man) may beare Armes.
And histories doe make mention that the Enunch Narcete in the reigne
of Iustinian expulsed the Goths out of Italy. Likewise Eucherius a principall
fauourite of the Emperour Constantius was both an Eunuch and a
Captaine very notable. And Cyrus hauing conquered Babylon made choice
of Eunuches onely to guard his person, holding them of no lesse force then
other men, and by example of horses gelded, was perswaded, their bodies
were no whit disabled for the warre.
                  But as these before may not be receiued, in respect of natural debilitie,
so others for respect of qualification, are priuiledged and excused, as
Priests, and persons Ecclesiasticall, to whom Romulus granted Immunities:
the like grace was giuen to the Druides in France, by Caesar: also all
Graduates in schoole may challenge that priuiledge.
                  The same Immunitie is also due to men aged, and those youths that are
not of perfect strenght; for so was it iudged by Gordianus the yonger: In
which point the law of Gracchus is also much to bee liked, for thereby hee
commaundeth that no person of lesse age then seuenteene yeeres should
be called vnto the warre.

                  Of yong Souldiers, called Tyrones.
                  
                     IT is said of Hercules Prodicus, That hee growing towards
mans estate, retired himselfe into a solitarie place; and there
sitting alone, considered, that two waies there were to passe
the course of his life: the one was of pleasure, the other of
industrie and vertue. This consideration I recommend to
all yong men, yet therewith wish, the choise should not be left vnto themselues:
For the greatest number affecting idlenesse or sensuall delight, or
else wanting mature iudgement, would follow that way they finde themselues
inclined vnto. It therefore behooueth they should be compelled to
the exercise of vertue and Armes. And as great pitie it were to withholde
the rewards due to militarie merit, so not to incite young men to the exercise
of Armes, were an errour inexcusable. For so was it decreed by lawe
of Dioclesianus and Maximianus: which also was more anciently obserued
of the Romanes, as by their histories appeareth: For when Quintus Seruilius
(being Tribunus Plebis, with authoritie Consulare) was to assemble an
armie against the Lucanes and Equians, he refused to make a confuse choise
of the people, and elected of the yonger sort onely. After that time, the
Dictator Camillus with his General of horse Seruilius Hala, did the like. And
Appius Claudius, with Lucius Furius Camillus, beeing Consuls, by direction
of the Senate, in a warre against the Gauls, did choose only yong men, both
of the Citie and of the Countrey: yea sometimes for want of them, prisoners
and persons condemned were pressed to beare Armes. In some other
ages by reason of scarcitie of able bodies, some youths before they were
seuenteene yeeres old, and others that exceeded fiftie, were forced to the
warre. But here is to be remembred, that neither these Tyrones, nor others
for necessitie chosen, ought be of equall reputation vnto more ancient soldiers:
yet thus much priuiledge the Romanes did allow them, That when
any errour was committed, they were (in respect of youth and want of
experience) the sooner pardoned. In the flourishing state of the Romane
Empire, the Tyrones were chosen out of the free borne, at the age of 17.
yeeres by Officers called Conquisitores,
                     Scruius Honoratus. and for the first yeere they had their
Tutors, and Guardians appointed to ouersee them. But it is referred to one
among other causes of the ouerthrow of the Empire, when landed men
were charged to finde Tyrones according to their reuenues and possessions.
For Vegetius writeth, Lib. 1. cap. 7. Tot vbique ab bostibus illatae sunt clades, dum
longa pax militem incuriosiùs legit, dum possessoribus indicti Tyrones per gratiam
aut dissimulationem probantur, tales
                           •
                         sociantur armis quales dimini habere fastidiunt.
For then slaues, and base people were matriculated for souldiers, insomuch
as straight lawes were made to the contrarie.
               
               
                  
                  CHAP. 8.
                  Of olde Souldiers, whome the Romanes
called Veterani.
                  
                     THe Romanes called those soldiers Veterani, that had serued
long either in the Legion, or elsewhere, and behaued themselues
dutifully as beseemed honest men. The time ascribed
vnto that name of Veteranus, was commonly twenty yeeres,
which beeing passed, the souldier was called also Emeritus.
The priuiledges bestowed vpon such persons were so great, as diuers Emperous
did contend who should be most liberall. Also Canutus king of
Denmarke decreed, That when souldiers did meet to eat, the yonger should
giue place to him that was his ancient in Armes, because his meaning was
(euen in ordinarie ceremonies) to obserue the honour due vnto ancient
seruice, and whosoeuer in that case failed to performe the Kings commandement,
should be cassed with ignominie. Constantinus the Emperour priuiledged
old soldiers so much, as to exempt them from all imposition, contribution,
and exaction, The great Antoninus, and his father before him,
commanded that all Veterani should be free from paying vnto the building
of ships; also in buying of wares in faire, or market, they should passe without
paiment of custome. They were also permitted, without molestation,
to liue in ease and rest. Also to them it was lawfull to vse commerce, fell,
employ money, traffique, and doe all things for their owne best commodity.
So concluding, we say, that the Emperour Dioclesianus and Maximianus
ordained, That vnto euery Veteran, hauing honestly serued in any
Legion, or vnder any ensigne the space of twentie yeeres, an honourable
or causarie dismission should be granted. After which time, he enioyed many
other immunities, which extended also to his children, but no further.
And Constantinus, besides many other graces, commanded they should be
offered no sort of iniurie, thinking it vnmeete that men so much priuiledged
by their Prince, should endure any wrong or indignitie. Neuerthelesse,
if they, or any of them did steale, or commit felonie, then without respect
of priuiledge, the punishment due by law should be inflicted. But
rarely is it seene, that men hauing long liued vertuously, and enioying the
degrees of honour, should offend or doe any act of slander or infamie.
Lastly, the Veterani might marry wiues, they could not be put to tortour,
nor condemned to the Mines nor publique workes, they night manure
their lands: for Constantine the Great assigned them lands that would fall to
husbandry, and to euery one of them to buy necessaries 25000, pieces of
money called Folles, one yoke of oxen, and an hundred bushels of graine.
To the other 100000. of those Folles, as appeareth in Codex Theodosianus li. 7.
titulo 20. where there is also a most ample Priuiledge granted to them by
the said Constantine.

                  ¶Of Souldiers called Emeriti.
                  
                     REasonable it seemeth, that souldiers hauing endured the
danger, toile, and trauell of the warre, should be suffered
to leade the rest of their liues in ease and rest: for so hath
their long and loyall seruice deserued. We read that the
Legionarie souldiers of Rome that had many yeeres continued
in pay (without committing any crime) were licensed
to depart at their pleasure, notwithstanding the Oath formerly taken:
and euery man hauing so serued the state, might also claime the priuiledges
appertaining to old souldiers: for so was it decreed by Tiberius the
Emperour: and Caligula (as Tacitus sayth) taking view of his bands, dispensed
with diuers Captaines before they had gray haires: as one that respected
rather their imbecilitie and strength decayed, then the time they
had serued: beeing perswaded that age approching, was a cause sufficient
to merit honest libertie. It was therefore thought fit, that all souldiers that
had well serued, should bee left to their libertie. Antoninus the Emperour
commanded that such men should be dismissed with honour, and extraordinarily
rewarded. Which fauour was granted, not onely to men armed,
but also vnto all officers that followed the Generall, and serued in place of
reputation: yet were they inhibited to keepe company with other men,
then such as made profession of Armes, or to intermeddle in any affaires,
not appertaining vnto the warre, vpon paine to forfeit ten pounds in gold.
These Emeriti were alwayes ancient seruitours, and professours of Armes,
who continued in Court or Campe, euer ready to perfourme the Emperours
will and commandement. Touching the time of their seruice, it seemeth
to rest chiefly in the Princes commandement, and was sometimes
more, and sometimes lesse, as hath bene formerly said: yet in shorter space
then ten yeeres, no souldier was (with grace) dismissed, as shall be more
particularly said in the Chapter of Cassation.
               
               
                  
                  CHAP. 10.
                  ¶Of crimes Militarie in generall.
                  
                     FIrst it is to be knowen, that some crimes be common, and
punishable in all men: and some are proper to men of war
onely: of the first are forgeries, adulterie, publique and priuate
violence, sedition, manslaughter, burning of houses,
treason, sacrilege & other enormities: for whosoeuer committeth
any such offence, whether he be a man of warre or not, the punishment
due is all one. Crimes proper to souldiers, are such only as are committed
contrarie to discipline Militarie, and excuseable in other men, not
being souldiers. Now is it necessarie to vnderstand how crimes contrary
to Militarie Iustice ought be punished. We call that discipline Militarie,
whereby men are made obedient, and instructed in all such qualities as are
required in a souldier. And for so much as the readiest way vnto vertue, is
first to restraine vice, we must endeuour by discipline to hold men in obedience.
And notwithstanding al humane policie and lawes, both diuine and
humane, some men there are so vile and malicious, as (without respect) will
commit all actes or iniuries that can be inuented, yet good gouernours do
forecast, not onely what men doe, but also what may be done: which moued
the Romanes to consider that some men did commit faultes beyond
expectation, in so much as there wanted not of those that haue slaine their
owne fathers. For which offence, Solon in his lawes prouided no punishment:
and being asked why he did not inflict penaltie vpon those offendors,
answered, he thought not that any man would haue bene so wocked.
We therefore thinke fit, to prescribe punishments vnto all crimes: for
souldiers (like vnto others) be neither gods nor perfect creatures, but men
apt to erre, and without restraint of law not to be gouerned. Arrius Meander
in his first booke Dere Militari saith, Crimes properly Militarie are
those which a man (as a souldier) doth commit. And here a certaine difference
betweene errour and crime is to be noted: for we call that an error
when any thing is done contrary to common discipline: as to be slouthful,
disobedient, and vnwilling: but he is said to commit a crime, when the
fault is accompanied with intent to hurt: for without that intent, the acte
may be imputed to destenie or chance, and as a thing happened vnwares:
therefore Antoninus the Emperour did command Herculianus and other
Captaines, that if a souldier hauing stroken another man, did prooue the
act was without intent to kill, that then he should not bee condemned of
manslaughter: as if a man be slaine when souldiers be trained, or in exercise
of armes, then that act is not accounted criminall, but casuall: yet if
such an act be done in any other place, the doer thereof shall be re
                        •
                     uted
guiltie. But as the humors of men are diuers, so are the crimes by them
committed of diuers qualitie, as hereafter shallbe discoursed.
               
               
                  
                  CHAP. 11.
                  Of treason and Traytors.
                  
                     ALbeit a custome most common it is that Traitors flying vnto
the enemie, are well entreated and greatly esteemed, so
long as their seruice is thought profitable: yet afterwardes
(their condition being knowen) that credit doth decay, and
consequently the fauour they finde becommeth euery day
lesse then other. The law calleth them Traytors that indeuour to betray
their Prince or the libertie of their countrey: they are also called Traytors
that hauing a charge, doe yeeld the same vp vnto the enemie, of whom it
is by law decreed, they ought to be capitally punished, or at the least discharged.
Likewise all Explorators or spies that bewray our secrets and
enforme the enemie, are accounted Traytors, and worthy capitall punishment.
With these offendors the Aegyptians vsed to deale more mildly, for
in that case the offendors had their tongues cut out, and so suffered to liue.
They were also accounted to haue committed a crime treasonable, that
furnished the enemie with weapon or munition, whereby they might offend
vs, and we with more difficultie offend them. The goods of such men
ought be confiscate, and their liues subiect vnto death. The doctor Paulus
iudged that who so did sell any armour vnto the enemie, did thereby incurre
the forfeiture of his life. Edward the third, king of England, in a Parliament
holden at Winchester, caused Edmond Earle of Kent to be conuicted
of Treason, for perswading other Lords to rebell. Yet true it is, that Traitors
are diuersly punished, according to the qualitie of the crime, the custome
of the countrey, and the discretion of the Prince. Tullus Hostilius
king of Rome, caused Metius Suffetius guiltie of Treason, to be beaten by
the Littori, and after torne in pieces with horses. Antony de Leua defending
Pauia, discouered a souldier of his had informed the French, that in
that citie small store of powder remained, he called him to be examined:
and the fault confessed, the souldier was put to death and quartered. Among
the Athenians it was not lawfull to burie a Traitor, which was the
cause that the bones of Themistocles were secretly caried into his friendes
house and there buried. Bellesarius finding that a Citizen of Athens called
Laurus, had complotted treason, commanded his bodie should be brought
vnto a hill before the citie, and there thrust thorow with a stake, which maner
of death is at this day vsed in Turkie. Charles the Emperour making
warre vpon Philip duke of Austria, practized with certaine of the Captains
to perswade Philip to leaue the fielde, who hauing compassed so much as
the Emperour required, they demanded a reward of their treason: which
was foorthwith payed in counterfeit money, and caried home. But the

Traytors perceiuing the money not to be good, returned therewith, desiring
better payment: The Emperour calling both for the Traytors and
the payers, caused the Traytors to be put out of the doores, saying, That
false workemen must be payed with false coyne.

                  ¶Of Disobedience.
                  
                     TOuching contumacie, or disobedience, the law determineth,
that whosoeuer resuseth or omitteth to execute that which
the General commandeth, or doth what he forbid deth, ought
to be punished by passing the pikes; yea though he hath effected
what he would: which rule the Romanes obserued precisely,
as appeareth by the Iustice of Lucius Papirius the Dictator in flicted
vpon Fabius Rutilianus Generall of the horse, although he were victorious
and had slaine twenty thousand Samnites. Likewise by the iudgement of
Torquatus against his sonne (hauing contrary to his cōmandement fought
with the Tusculans and gained victorie) was neuertheles beheaded. Therefore
it remaineth (as a rule) that not onely breach of commandement, but
also simple contumacie is an offence capital, if the same be apparant. Yea,
sometimes omission of due respect is criminall, though not euer capitall.
As if a man with order doe enter into a place guarded, or passe out by
any other way then that which the Generall hath appointed. Another
point of disobedience it is, not to goe vnto the army being called, or without
licence to depart from thence: for that is indeed an apparant contempt,
and by the Romans punished with death. Omnis contumacia aduersus Ducem
capite punienda est. Posthumius Triburtius commanded Aulus Posthumius to be
put to death, for vanquishing the enemie without his commission: and Aulus
Fuluius for going to fight vncommanded, condemned his sonne to die.
Yet the Aegyptians made a law that Captaines and souldiers, for disobedience,
should not be put to death, but remaine infamous, vntill by some
notable seruice their reputation were rccouered. Arrius made a lawe,
that if a man did wound his fellow souldier (though it were with a stone)
he ought to be cassed: it it were with a sword, to loose his life. The like
was decreed by Kanutus King of Denmarke.

                  Of Cowardise.
                  
                     IT seemeth that all Militarie offences may be comprised in
three, viz. Cowardise, Treason, and Disobedience: yet
will wee speake more particularly. Touching the first, easily
may it be conceiued, that Cowardise is the cause and
occasion of many other transgressions, for who so is irresolute,
or apt to entertaine feare, is also soon perswaded to saue himselfe with
dishonour. By Cowardise souldiers doe forsake their rankes: and sometimes
abandon their Ensigne: which faults the Romanes punished with
death. It was long since by an Edict commanded in France, that whosoeuer
did forsake his colours, or the ranke wherein he was placed, should receiue
punishment by passing the pikes. Another kinde of Cowardise is to
faine sickenesse, or without leaue to be absent from the Armie. He is also
culpable of that crime, that leaueth his place of standing vpon the wall,
during the assault: or shall abandon the trench. Yet true it is, if any such
fault bee committed at any other time then during the assault, the same is
not absolutely capitall, but is arbitrable. It hath bene also anciently vsed,
that if a souldier without lawfull excuse did goe from the Watch, or office
of Scout, or any other seruice allotted vnto him by the Sergeant, that
then he should be iudged to passe the Pikes, or Harquebuzies, according
to that kinde of weapon wherewith he serued. And if many souldiers (as
a whole Ensigne or troupe) did commit that crime, the Roman vse was to
execute euery tenth man, in presence of the rest: to the end the pain might
fall vpon fewe, and the terrour to all. And in such cases of Cowardise the
Generall ought to be inexorable, because seueritie doth make an army inuincible.
The experience whereof was seene when Spartacus defeated the
Romanes conducted by Crassus. For presently vpon that dishonour, Crassus
commanded a decimation, and put to death a tenth man in euery Legion,
for not hauing fought manfully. That being done, he begun to fight a-new:
And albeit the number of Romans was diminished, yet were they victorious,
and cut the enemies in pieces. But here is to be noted, that of fleeing
there is two sorts, the one proceeding of a sudden and vnlooked for
terror, which is least blameable: the other is voluntary, and as it were a
determinate intention to giue place vnto the enemie: A fault exceeding
foule, and not excusable.

                     BEsides these crimes formerly touched, many other there
are that merit seuere punishment, and chiefly, To abandon
the Armie, and flee to the enemie. For what iniurie can
be greater, or what offence more foule in a souldier, then
being instructed, trained, and well entertained, to employ
his vertue in seruice of an enemie? This crime was therefore in ancient
time grieuously punished, and the greater the qualitie was of him that did
offend, the more was the punishment inflicted. Yet doe we not finde any
particular paine ascribed to this offence, but left to discretion of the Generall.
Neuerthelesse in that case it shall not be amisse to imitate the ancient
proceeding of ancient Chieftaines. The Romanes therefore for punishment
of the Brutij, who fled vnto Hannibal, protested them to be from
thenceforth neither souldiers, nor companions in armes, but persons ignominious,
and seruants vnto the Armie. And when Cyrus intercepted a
letter, which one of his Captaines called Orontes had written, offering to
serue the enemie with a company of horse, Cyrus assembled the Leaders,
and in their presence condemned Orontes to death. Fredericus the second
possessing the kingdome of Naples, was by his sonne Henrie abandoned,
and being with the enemie he pardoned him, yet with condition he should
confine himselfe to the bounds of Apulia, vntill his father returned from
Germany: during which time, Henry practised some other innouation, and
therefore was put in prison, and in the end suffered death. Elfricus a chiefe
Leader vnder Etheldred King of England, pretending to doe seruice, fled
vnto the Danes: but the warre being ended, he returned vnto his Prince,
desiring his life: which with difficulty he obtained, yet did the King command
his eyes should be put out.
                  To these offendors, we may adde all such as secretly doe relieue the enemie
with counsell, money, meate, or by any other meane whatsoeuer. In
which case the Emperour Constantius decreed, that if a souldier, Captaine,
or Leader did vtter any word, signe, or voice, to encourage the enemie, that
for so doing he should be tied in chaines, and as a beast be led whersoeuer
the Armie went.
                  Of this kinde we may account two other sorts of men, whom the Romanes
called Emansores & Desertores. They named him Desertor that went
from the Armie, and did not onely secretly depart, but stayed long with
the enemie, as one intending neuer to returne. But Emansor was hee that
without licence went away, and very shortly did come againe, and therefore
his offence reputed the lesse. This error is most commonly found in

yong souldiers whom we call Tyrones. Neither are they to be all punished
alike, but the Iudge is to examine the circumstances of the cause. The law
willeth that who so is found a Desertor in warre, is to be capitally punished,
whether hee were horseman or souldier on foote. But if a horseman
doe prooue a Desertor in peace, he thereby forfeiteth his degree: or
if he were a footman he looseth his pay. If such an offender be found in the
citie, he incurreth the losse of his head: but being elswhere found (and that
the first fault) hee may be restored, but offending the second time, shall
loose his life. He that to this fault shall adde any other, ought be the more
sharpely punished: and hauing so offended, he shall be in case, as if he had
bene twise a Desertor. To this kind of offence, in diuers ages, and by diuers
Princes, diuers penalties were appointed. The Spartanes repulsed such men
from being capable of any office, and to liue euer vnmarried: also to giue
place to all other men, and haue the one side of their beards shauen. Auidius
the vsurper commanded, that some should haue their hands cut off,
and other their legges broken. Dauid King of Scottes, and second of that
name, being forced to flee his kingdome, at his returne (as one mindfull of
those that abandoned him in time of danger) caused all Chiefetaines and
Captaines to pay money, and would haue disinherited Robert Stewart, who
was before named his heire. Also for an example to posteritie, he imposed
a pecuniary punishment vpō al those that did abandon their king in fight.
                  Another sort of fugitiues be they, that beeing taken prisoners, will not
returne (although so they might:) of which number, some doe onely rest
with the enemie, and others doe take part and fight on his side, which is an
offence of great importance. Paulus the Ciuilian writeth, That such offenders
should be either burned aliue, or hanged. Vlpianus would haue them
also burned.Or, rather, as some report, he was not executed by the King for leauing
him, but by the factious Lords for adhering firmely to the King. 
                     Nicholas Brembre an Alderman of London at a battell in Essex,
or neere Oxford (as others say) fled from King Richard the second, and
after being found in Wales, was brought from thence to London, where
hee was publikely put to death. Also at the siege of Capua, seuen hundred
fugitiues were taken, beaten with roddes, and their hands cut off. By these
examples appeareth, that no certeine punishment was inflicted for this
offence.
                  To these we may adde all seditious persons, who desirous of innouation
doe attempt diuers enterprises to mooue mutenie or rebellion. These seditions
are most commonly in armies composed of diuers nations, or
where strangers are called for aide. In Cybaris a great number of Achaians
and Troezenians did dwell quietly, vntill the Achei finding their number the
greater, tooke Armes and expulsed the Troezeni. In Constantinople likewise
the strangers did conspire to oppresse the Citizens, but in a battell were all
forced to flie. Also after the suppression of the tyrants in Syracusa, the strangers
and hired souldiers fell into great dissention. For reformation of this
fault, Iulius Caesar is to be followed, who finding such a mischiefe to arise,
cleared the armie of all busie heads, sware the souldiers, and at the beginning
repressed the sedition. Modestinus the doctor did giue counsell, that
whosoeuer did begin any muteny, should loose his life, if the sedition were
dangerous; but beeing of lesse moment, the beginner thereof should be

cassed. The law of Naples commandeth, that souldiers or others, mouing
any sedition, should forfeit both life and goods. Trebonius a chiefe conspiratour
against Caesar, was put to death by Dolabella: and Marinas Phalerius
Duke of Venice, for conspiring against that state, was beheaded: yet in some
places and times the punishment of these offences was onely pecuniall, or
infamie.
                  Another crime of greater consequence it is, to yeeld vp, or abandon a
place of strength, or depart from a standing giuen in charge: for by the
Romane lawe, those crimes were euer accounted capitall. It is likewise
capital for feare of an enemie, to forsake the trench, the wall, or other place
to be defended. Therefore Augustus Caesar, caused certaine Captaines (hauing
abandoned a place) vpon paine of death to recouer it. Modestinus
saith, That he who leaueth his place of watch or warde, is to be reputed
worse then an Emansor, and consequently for such a fault to be punished,
or at the least be discharged his seruice: and he that forsaketh the trench,
incurreth the same penaltie, though the enemie doe make no approch:
but if the enemie be at hand, then so to doe, is capitall. Euery man may
reade that Appius Claudius sent certaine bands against the Volses, and they
abandoning their ranks, were beaten with rods, and after executed: which
proceeding seemeth extreame, and therefore in like case some fewe haue
bene put to death to terrifie the rest. Antonius leading an armie against
the Parthians, executed onely euery tenth man of those that first did runne
away. The like was done by Appius Claudius in the warre against the Volses,
putting a few of those souldiers to death, that first abandoned their Ensignes.
Caius Caesar, according to the Lawes of Petreius (at suite of the
Legions) did put to death onely twelue persons that were the chiefe moouers
of sedition; so great was his mercie. Neuerthelesse, the vse was euer
to put him to death that did flee first. It is sayd that Epaminondas walking
the round where the watch was set, hapned to finde a souldier fast asleepe,
whom forth with he slew with his sword: saying, As he found him, so hee
left him. The like penaltie doe they incurre that sleepe, or depart from
their place of watch: which moued Epaminondas to account a souldier sleeping,
like a man without life.
                  By the law Militarie it is prouided, that if any Souldier doe loose his
Armes, or sell them, hee shall for so doing be capitally punished, or at the
least disabled to beare Armes, at the discretion of the Iudge. Or if any souldier
doe cast away his Armes, and not defend himselfe against the enemie,
shall thereby incurre infamy. The old Romanes reputed him worthy to receiue
a bastonado that abandoned his Ensigne. The like punishment they
thought due to him that did forsake the Generall. If any Captaine did flee
from his Company, or any Ensigne-bearer did let fall his Colours, he was
beheaded, or beaten to death with cudgels. Appius Claudius being sent against
the Volses, caused certaine Ensigne-bearers, for loosing their Colours,
and others that fled out of their rankes, to be beaten with rods. Paulus
the doctor holdeth it a great fault for any Souldier to sell his Armes: yet
seemeth hee lesse culpable then the former. But that kinde of crime is
thought equal vnto desertion: and whether he sell all or part of his Armes,

the fault is one. Yet that doctour maketh this difference, viz. he that selleth
his greaues or his powldrō s, ought to be beaten: But who so selleth his shield,
his head-peece or sword, shalbe punished as a Desertor. In this age to
loose, exchange, or borrow the Armes belonging to another Ensigne, is an
offence very great, and so punished by the Edict of Francis the French
King. Likewise by the Law of Scotland, if any Souldier doe empawne his
sword, hee should be reputed vnworthy the company of other Souldiers,
and iudged infamous; yet true it is, that if any yong Souldier (whom the
Romanes called Tyro) do commit that fault, he ought to be punished with
more fauour. Now concluding wee say, that seeing the losse or selling of
Armes, argueth no magnaimitie, courage, or care of a Souldier, but is rather
a signe of slouth and pusillanimitie, incurring that error, hee is not to
be esteemed better then a base or abiect companion. And for that reason
it seemeth the Spartans did well to banish Archilocus the Poet, writing these
words, Melius est arma abijcere, quàm mori.
                  
                  Among these Militarie crimes, we may not forget that which the lawe
calleth crimen falsi. This fault may be diuers wayes committed, and chiefly
by fayning sicknesse, which is a signe of cowardise, and vnworthy a souldier.
The Lawyers assigne to that offence, a beating with cudgels. Another
way this fault may be incurred, if a man that is no souldier, wil affirme
he is a souldier, or weareth an Ensigne which he ought not: the one was
punishable by the law Cornelia, the other to be more seuerely punished, by
the opinion of Modestinus. The Egyptians made a law that who so counterfeited
false letters, or razed any writing, should haue both his handes
cut off. Kenethus king of Scots made an ordinance in his kingdome, that
who so committed this fault, should be hanged, and forthwith cast into a
graue. Of this crime are they also guiltie, that make any counterfeit money:
and they that forge false keyes to escape out of prison. Yet Constantinus
the Emperour referreth this last fault to the discretion of competent
Iudges.
                  It is also a fault very infamous to commit any theft, either in the fielde
or towne, and consequently seuerely to be punished. The Romanes vsed
therefore to sweare souldiers (were they seruants or freemen) to carie nothing
out of the campe: or if by hap any thing were found, then the finder
to bring it vnto the Tribune: But if neither loue of vertue nor othe preuailed
to withhold men from stealing, then were they with great seueritie
by the Romane law punished. Valentinus and Theodosius consented, that if
any souldier did spoile houses or fields, the countrey people might then assemble,
and kill them. The like was permitted by the Edict of Francis the
French King 1523: yet with this caution, that if any of those theeues were
taken aliue, that then they should be brought before the Iudges or Gouernours
of the prouince, and by their discretion receiue correction. This
crime was euer accounted so detestable, as whosoeuer therein did offend
(though the goods taken were of small worth) yet was the offendour seuerely
chastified. Tiberius the Emperour caused a souldiers head to be cut
off, for stealing a Peacoke. Charles Duke of Burgundie commanded a souldier
to be nailed vnto a post, for taking a hen from a poore woman. Selim
                     
the Turkish Emperour caused Bostangi Bassa his sonne in law to be beheaded,
for spoiling the Prouinces where he was gouernor. Francis the French
King decreed, That if any purueyour or victualler of the Campe, contrary
to his Commission, did exact or cary away the commodities of his subiects,
it should be capitall, were it in towne or countrey.
                  For many respects also the vice of adultery ought be seuerely punished,
as well in warre as peace: which caused Lucius Cautilius Scriba, the same
yeere the Romanes were defeated at Canna (by commaundement of the
chiefe Bishop) to be beaten extreamely, for hauing committed that crime
with Florina. Iulius Caesar likewise caused a speciall fauorite of his to be capitally
punished, for dishonoring the wife of a Romane gentleman, though
no complaint was made thereof. Papinianus the doctor sayth, That if any
souldier doe keepe in his house his owne sisters daughter, hee may be reputed
an adulterer. And as a Maxime or Rule it was decreed by all doctors
of Law, That no souldier condemned of adultery may after beare Armes.
By the law Iulia the crime of adultery was thought worthy of infamie, and
the offenders disabled to beare Armes. Aurelianus commanded, that if any
souldier did rauish the wife of his host, he should be tyed vnto two trees,
and torne in pieces. Frotho king of Scots made a law, That if any man by
force defloured a virgine, he should be gelded. The Egyptians proclaimed,
That whosoeuer was found in adultery (although it were with consent)
yet the man should be beaten with a thousand stripes, and the woman
haue her nose cut of
                        •
                     . Diuers other military offences there are, which for
breuitie I omit: wishing all Princes, Generals, and other soueraigne commanders
in Armes, to encline rather to mercy then extreame seueritie:
following the aduice of Salustius, who perswadeth, that souldiers should
not (for ordinary errours) be punished like vnto vulgar people; and euer
respect to be had vnto those that were ancient seruants and Emeriti. For
in the raigne of Antoninus, so great honour was giuen to old souldiers (called
Veterani or Emeriti) as if any of their sonnes had offended, they were
not (like to others) condemned to labour in the mines of mettall or other
publike workes, but sent into a certaine Iland. And heere is to be noted,
that this fauour extended no further then the first degree. It is also to be remembred,
that as punishments are diuers, so ought they be diuersly inflicted:
for no Captaine or other commander of greater qualitie, ought be
condemned to the mine, or forced to labour in those workes; neither may
hee be hanged or burned, vnlesse the crime be capitall. Also souldiers
should not bee cast vnto beasts to be eaten, nor put vnto torture: which
priuiledge is precisely obserued in Italy. And in this point, Magistrates
are to regard the qualitie of crimes, and the circumstances: for hee that
committeth an outrage vpon his father, meriteth an extreame punishment;
but he that is drunke or wanton, deserueth not so great an infliction.
The qualitie of offenders is also to be looked vnto: for freemen and
bondmen are not to be equally vsed. Nowe to conclude this matter of
crimes military, we say that the Romanes practised all these punishments,
Viz. Pecuniaria mulcta, Munerum indictio, Militiae mutatio, Gradus

deiectio, & Ignominiosa missio: Which is, Pecuniall taxation, Forfeiture
of immunitie, Putting out of seruice, Degradation, and Ignominious
cassation.

                  ¶Of punishment pecuniarie.
                  
                     SOme crimes are of such quality as souldiers are onely checked
in their pay, for negligence: or otherwise taxed for
their absence: yet ought they not be reproued as Desertors,
or loyterers, if by sickenesse, imprisonment, or other constraint
they were forced to commit offence. For to such
faults the law assigneth no other punishment then at the discretion of the
Chieftaine. Yet doth it appeare, that in the yeare 153. ab vrbe condita,
Publius Varro, and Marcus Sergius Tribuni militum, hauing receiued a defeat
of the Vienti, they & the souldiers were commanded to pay a great summe
of money, notwithstanding that Sergius affirmed the losse to proceed only
from the fortune of warre. And Virginius desired he might not bee made
more vnfortunate at home, then he had bene in the field. Zeno the Emperor
punished a souldier for taking vpon him to let another mans house, his
owne terme being therein determined: because Iustinianus had inhibited
souldiers to dispose or meddle with goods not their own. Vnto like punishment
is hee subiect that shall require his Prince to permit him to receiue
pay, in two diuers armies. If any souldier did take vpon him other
function then that of the warre, or so do, as deputie vnto another, he was
taxed in ten pounds of gold. Archadius and Honorius made a lawe that if any
souldier disturbed a victualer, he should pay an hundred pounds of gold.
The same Emperors ordeined, that if any Captaine or other Commander
whatsoeuer did vse a greater part of an house or lodging, then the Harbenger
had allotted vnto him, he should incurre the penaltie of three hundred
pounds in gold, & if any souldier of lesse quality so did, he should be cassed.
Theodosius the Emperour to suppresse all euill customes in the war, decreed,
that if a souldier required any thing that was appertaining to his host, he
should be taxed to pay ten pounds. The French King made a law, that if
souldiers did take the goods of any Citizen, or man of the countrey, hee
should be capitally punished, as if they had committed theft. Kanutus King
of Denmarke ordeined, that all military paines might be satisfied and redeemed
by money, excepting only the chastisement of beating: therfore who
so had incurred the crime of manslaughter was condemned in forty thousand
talents of money: one part thereof to be payd vnto the King, another
to the souldiers, and the third to the kinsfolke of the party slaine.

                  Of degrading and dishonouring Souldiers.
                  
                     
                        APpius Claudius, by commandement of the Senate, pronounced
that all the Romane souldiers taken prisoners by King
Pyrrhus of Epiro, and after by him freely set at liberty, should
be put backe, and lose honour. Hee that serued on horsebacke,
from thencefoorth became a footman. He that was
a foote souldier was put to a sling: and he that embezeled another mans
weapon, was vtterly discharged. Hee that abandoned his place, did forfeit
his degree. He that in peace did forsake a Leader of horse, was put from
his place: and if many haue done so, and returne shortly, then they were
all abased and appointed to meaner seruices. He that moued any muteny
or small sedition, was degraded and abased. Diuers Emperors haue decreed,
that if any souldier on the holy day did behold Comedies or other
vaine sights, he should lose his entertainement. Iustinianus depriued
a Captaine called Bessa, for hauing omitted opportunitie to renforce a
place of strength called Petra. Seuerus the Emperor confined and degraded
all the Praetorian souldiers that distrubed Pertinax. He also tooke from
them their militarie girdles, their apparel and other ornaments, confining
them to abide an hundreth miles from the citie. Fuluius Flaccus the Censor
deposed his brother from militarie dignitie, because hee being a Tribune,
without order from the Senate, did license a band of souldiers to returne
to their houses.
               
               
                  CHAP. 17.
                  ¶Punishment Militarie by beating.
                  
                     FOrasmuch as great Captaines did finde by experience, that
hope of impunitie, was the occasion of many Militarie errors,
and to the end no fault should be free from chastisement:
they therefore appointed paines to be inflicted vpon
euery offence. A souldier that resisted correction offered
by his Captaine, was beaten with a cudgell: and if he laid holde or hand
thereof, he was cassed: and if he brake it or laid hand vpon his Captaine,
he was put to death: whereof may be inferred, that souldiers were anciently

beaten. The Romane vse in this kinde of punishment was thus: A
Captaine comming to correct a souldier, at the first sleightly touched his
person with a cudgell, or (as some haue written) with a withy made of a
vine tree, which done, all other men present in the Armie did strike the
condemned man with staues and stones: yet when many had offended together,
they were not thus handled, but out of a great number some eight
or ten of the seditious were slaine, the rest sent away. In the meane space
all were in feare of equall punishment. The Senate of Rome vsed to deliuer
vnto their Captaines a certaine short staffe or cudgell, wherewith to beat
the souldiers that offended, which serued also to direct them in their
march and rankes. This punishment they called Castigatio per vitem. Hadrianus
the Emperour refused to deliuer any such staffe, but onely to Captaines
of discretion and good fame. It is also written that Lucilius a Centurion
hauing broken his staffe required another, and breaking that also demanded
a third. Whereupon (as Tacitus noteth) he was nicknamed, Cedò alteram,
i. Reach me another. Caluinus called also Domitius obteined license of
the Senate to beat a Captaine named Iubillius for fleeing the field cowardly.
It is also extant that certain Legions, abandoning a Consul were beaten
(or as now by the Italian phrase wee terme it) did receiue the Bastonado.
This kind of punishment was euer accompanicd with infamy: which moued
Kanutus king of Denmarke to decree, that all punishments of that kind,
might be dispensed with for money: alledging that because dogges were
so corrected, therefore it was of all other chastisements most ignominious,
and consequently to be abhorred, perswading all great Captaines to vse
temperance, and to punish rarely and aduisedly: remembring that Phaleucus
a Generall of the Phocenses was slaine by a souldier, to whom he had
giuen a Bastonado: much more cautious and slow ought Collonels, and
priuate Captaines to be, in offering this kind of correction.

                  Of wages or pay.
                  
                     FOrsomuch as the life of man cannot bee susteined
without meate, and souldiers wants can not be supplied
where money lacketh, it behoueth they should
be furnished with ordinary and dayly wages. Yet
true it is that in times long since passed, men of warre
serued at their owne charge, and without pay: therefore
at what time the Romanes begun to giue wages
is not (I thinke) certainely knowen. Some histories
say, that vntill the reigne of king Tullus, the Romanes receiued no wages.
Others affirme that giuing of pay began when Massinissa made warre with
Syphax king of Numidia, for then Scipio hired certaine mercenary souldiers:

a course neuer before knowen among the Romanes. Liuy writeth that
in the yeere 348. ab vrbe conditae, when Gneus Cornelius Cossus, Valerius Potitus,
Publius Cornelius Cossus, and Claudius Fabius Ambustus were Tribunes
militarie with authoritie Consulate at the siege and sacke of Anxur, (now
called Terracina) the Senate decreed the soldiers should receiue pay out of
the common treasurie: for (saith he) vntill that time euery man prouided
for himselfe. Howsoeuer these payments began, sure it is (as Thucydides
writeth) that in the warre of Peloponesus, to euery footman two drachmae
was daily giuen: which in the moneth amounted vnto 60. How that pay
may be compared to ours, or the entertainement of souldiers in this part
of Europe I know not. Omitting therfore to say more therof, let vs see how
those payes were anciently bestowed. Antoninus the Emperor decreed that
in his reigne, no wages nor donatiue should be giuen to any souldier for
the time he did remaine with the enemie: although at his returne he were
allowed Postliminium. It therefore seemeth strange that Modestinus holdeth,
that if a souldier taken by the enemy, and hauing serued his full time,
doe returne home, he ought not to be intreated as an old souldier, and receiue
reward as an Emeritus. Whereunto Arrius Menander in his booke de
re Militari assenteth: yet here is to be noted, that to receiue a donatiue, and
to receiue wages, are diuers. For Donatiues are bestowed onely on those
men that haue performed their full time of seruice, and called Emeriti: but
wages or ordinarie pay is due as a yeerely or monethly entertainement.
To me therefore it seemeth not necessarie that donatiues should be giuen
vnto any man being a prisoner, nor that he can challenge pay to be due during
his absence, vnlesse the same be granted by speciall grace and fauour
of the Prince. For who so is a prisoner in the enemies hand, may be reputed
a dead man: and who can say a dead man deserueth pay? Moreouer,
as he who without lawfull leaue absenteth himselfe, ought to be checked,
so those souldiers that are slouthfull or lazie, doe woorthily merite to lose
their wages, according to the censure of Antoninus Pius the Emperour, saying,
That nothing was more vnreasonable then slouthfull folke to deuoure
the common weale, when by their labour they did not encrease the commoditie
thereof. Yet reason it is that sicke men should receiue their pay,
because they are supposed to serue, although they be by want of health
impeached: neither ought they be abridged of pay that are imployed in
their owne particular affaires so long as they depart not from the Armie,
nor the seruice receiueth preiudice.
               
               
                  
                  CHAP. 19.
                  ¶Restitution of Souldiers goods.
                  
                     THe Romanes and other free people made Lawes whereby
such lands or goods as were taken from them by the enemy,
should be restored. For what is lost in the warre or by
meane of the warre, the same was redeliuered vnto the
owner by force of the said Law called Postliminij ius: and it
seemeth a course of naturall equitie, that whatsoeuer hath bene taken and
kept by force in absence, the same should bee restored vnto the owner
when he returneth. As therefore by going out of our confines, a man looseth
his lands and goods; so by entring againe, hee may claime his owne.
This grace is granted not onely vnto men able for fight, but also to all others
that with counsell, seruice, or otherwise may stand the State in stead.
Likewise if a sonne be taken by the enemy, and during his imprisonment
the father dieth, he may at his returne home, enter into the possessions of
the father. Or if a mother were taken, and her sonne yet vnborne in her
body, when he is borne he may be ransomed for the prise of one souldier,
and returne to the lands hee is to inherit: yet true it is that freemen may
not enioy the benefit of this Law, vnlesse they returne with intention to abide
in their countrey; which was the reason that Attilius Regulus could
not be admitted to receiue his owne, hauing sworne to go againe vnto Carthage
and not continue at Rome. The same titles also haue they that bee
owners of great ships and Galleys fit for the warre, but Fishers and watermen
are denied that aduantage, because their vessels are made onely for
profit or pleasure, and not for the warre. Neither may any fugitiue receiue
this fauour: for he that leaueth his countrey with intent to do euill, or become
a traitour, must be accounted among the number of enemies. But if
a man doe goe vnto another countrey that is in league with vs, and then
returne, albeit that countrey be distant from ours, he shall not need to be
restored by vertue of this Law, but enioy his owne, as if he had neuer gone
from home. Yet true it is, that sometimes in peace a man may claime the
benefit of Postliminium, as when a freeman is deteined by force and made a
captiue: yet can hee not be said taken by the enemy, because those violences
which are vsed before the warre is published, are not properly called
actions of the warre; though the difference seemeth small, when they take
from vs, and we from them. But if a captiue doe flee from vs and returne,
he shal not be allowed Postliminium. Whoso is taken prisoner during his absence,
may be reputed as dead; for so the law doth account him: which reason
percase mooued Caius Cotta (returned home frō prison) to say, he was
twise borne. But here is to be remembred, that no prisoner returned, can

by the lawe of Postliminium receiue wages or donatiue for the time of absence,
vnlesse it be by grace. If a Citizen of Rome did goe from the Citie
without licence of the Senate (vnlesse he were taken by the enemy) he lost
the priuiledges of Rome, but being taken and returned, hee might recouer
his citie and libertie. It was also decreed by the Romanes, that if a father,
or the people did giue or sell a man, and the enemy receiue him, he might
not after be allowed Postliminium: but if the gift were not accepted, then
he might; because there is no giuer where a receiuer wanteth.

                  ¶Of Donatiues, or Rewards.
                  
                     THe ancient Emperours, and before them the Consuls and
other commanders in the warre, had in vse to bestow vpon
Captaines and Souldiers certaine giftes to encourage them
to serue well. Those great Magistrates did also vse after or
before any action of much importance, to assemble their
armie, and then selecting out of the whole number some fewe men of most
merite did giue vnto them notable commendation. They likewise vsed to
bestow a launce or sword vpon him that had wounded an enemie, or some
such weapon. To him that had vnhorsed or spoiled an enemie (if he were
a footeman) was giuen a pot of gold or other piece of plate. If hee were a
horseman, he receiued an ornament or fauour to be set on his crest. Hee
that mounted first vpon the wall of an enemies towne, receiued a crowne
of gold. These donations or fauours did not only encourage men to valour,
but also made them much honoured at home: for besides glory and
fame, they were also receiued into their countreys with much pompe and
applause: which incited others to attempt the like. Octauius Caesar after the
Philippian warre, did giue vnto the Legionarie souldiers certaine crownes,
and vnto euery Captaine a garment of purple: but Hostilius, one of those
Tribunes, saying those crowns and garments were like vnto boyes bables,
they were rewarded with land and money. Iulius Caesar did giue vnto the
sonnes of Adbucillus (the one called Rocillus, the other Aegus) in recompence
of their great seruice in Gallia, certaine lands there, besides diuers
summes of money, whereby they became inriched. The same Caesar, after
his triumph for victory against Pharnax, performed all the promises hee
had made; and gaue vnto euery souldier fiue thousand groats, to euery leader
twise so many, to euery horseman double so much. Pompeius hauing
ouercome Mithri
                           ••
                        tes, before he triumphed, bestowed vpon euery souldier
fiue hundred groats, and vpon the Captaines a farre greater reward.
The Scipiones and Metelli were likewise most careful to reward and honour
their souldiers. Alexander Seuerus was woont to say, That souldiers would

not liue in awe of their Generall, vnlesse they were well apparelled, well
armed, full fed, and some pence in their purses. Sometimes also souldiers
were honoured with other giftes, as crownes, lances, furniture of horses,
bracelets, lands, images of brasse or stone, with diuers other ensignes of
honour, as Plinie and Aulus Gellius haue written. Which gifts were by the
Doctors of Law anciently called Donatiues. But here it shall not be amisse
to remember the dishonourable Donations of Lucius Sylla, who vsed to
take money from the true owners, and giue the same to others.

                  Of Apparell.
                  
                     AS victuall is necessary, so is it requisite that souldiers should
be clothed: which moued great Commanders to be careful
that men of war might be euer furnished as wel of apparel
as of food. Caius Gracchus first procured a law to be made,
that garments might be giuen vnto souldiers without diminishing
their pay. Long after, the Emperors Archadius and Honorius caused
certaine money to be giuen vnto euery souldier for the prouision of his
coate: which order was in Illyria only. It was also anciently ordered that
military garments were prouided in this sort: viz. euery thirty inhabitants
payed for one souldiers coate in Thracia. The like was done in Scythia,
Mysia, Egypt, and euery other prouince subiect vnto the Empire. These
Countreyes were also sometimes taxed according to the acres of land, and
sometimes according to the number of dwellers, and the money payed into
the military treasury. Francis the French king proclaimed an Edict,
that souldiers resting in any citie or village in the winter, should haue garments
there: and being furnished for the summer, should vse their summer
suits vntill the winter following: and then resume them againe. And
in case the keeper of those garments did not truely restore them, then vpon
complaint vnto the Generall, order should be taken for the souldiers
satisfaction. By which meanes the souldiers were euer honestly clothed,
well armed, and comely furnished both on horsebacke and on foote. Yet
Pesceninus Niger inhibited souldiers to vse in the waare any girdle garnished
with gold or siluer, to the end the enemie should not be inriched. He
therefore commanded such ornaments to be reserued for their wiues and
children. Adrianus the Emperour vsed to weare in the warre plaine garments
without garnishing of gold, or strings set with stone. The scabberd
of his sword was also seldome wrought with Iuory. In the reigne of
Maximinus Caesar, after the Persian warre, a priuate souldier happened to
finde a purse or sachel set full of Margarites and precious stones, which hee
tooke off, contenting himselfe with the beaty of the leather whereof it

was made. For indeed garments of cloth and skinnes to keepe out colde
and raine, are onely needfull for souldiers. Yet true it is, that in the time of
the Emperour Iulianus, the maners of souldiers were changed. And Maximinianus
the yonger, vsed to weare a Iacke of golden maile, after the Polonian
guise: he also had his Armour and Launce gilded. Caius Caesar after a
great victory, suffered his souldiers to become wanton, and called them
companions in Armes, permitting them also to ornifie their weapons
with siluer and gold. And here it shall not be amisse, to tell how great regard
the Emperour Aurelianus had to discipline, notwithstanding the fauour
he afforded to all men of warre, charging his Captaines to obserue
these instructions: Sivis Tribunus esse, imò sivis viuere, manus militum contine:
adding these commandements, let no man take away the Pullen of
of another, his sheepe, his oyle, his wood, his grapes, his salt, but rest contented
with his victuall. Let souldiers liue vpon spoyle of the enemie, not
of the countrey. His armes shall be bright, and his garments strong, let
his new apparell supply the old, and his wages remaine in his purse, not in
the Tauerne: let him lay by his chaine and ring, and keep his horse fat. Let
no beast taken be sold, but euery man helpe another. Let the Physicians
cure infirmities freely, and without rewards. Let nothing be giuen to the
soothsayers. Let euery one be quiet in his lodging, for who so moueth any
mutenie or misrule shall be punished. This is in effect the summe of such
precepts as are to be obserued by souldiers: wherby appeareth what they
are to doe, what to leaue vndone, and what garments ancient Emperours
and souldiers were wont to vse. Yet true it is that the hope of all good seruice
and successe, doth consist in valour, conioyned with policie, whereunto
we will adde, that decent apparell, and fit ornaments of body, do become
all military commanders, as well to make them venerable in sight, as
also to giue beholders occasion to thinke, they are persons worthy of respect
and honour.

                  ¶Of Hostages.
                  
                     FOr the obseruation of Articles and capitulations of
truce or peace, Princes and common weales were
wont to deliuer certaine hostages or pledges, to
the ende that if promises were broken, then the
goods of hostages on the party breaking (by the
Edict of Commodus the Emperour) were confiscate,
I meane only those goods which the hostages
haue there gotten. Vlpianus writeth that hostages
cannot without licence dispose their owne goods by will or testament.
Hostages are deliuered either as captiues, or els as pledges to keepe conditions:

which being performed they ought be returned home: for vnto
other obligation free men may not bee bound. The Romanes acknowledging
ancient fauours to them done by King Philip, at such time as
they tooke Armes against Antiochus, and desirous to requite the same,
they sent Demetrius his sonne (then an hostage) vnto his father. Contrariwise
Constantinus being in Britaine beganne also a warre vpon the
Scots, and sent to them hostages, by which meane he made the Britaines
his sure friends: whereof the Scots informed, and knowing that secret intention,
suddenly slew all the hostages. Whereby appeareth that where
faith is broken, there reuenge is taken vpon hostages. Likewise Henry duke
of Saxonie holding Venceslaus brother to Pribislaius Prince of the Obotriti,
an hostage, put him to death euen in his brothers sight, for being a mouer
of that warre. We therefore conclude that hostages may be giuen, and
ought to be receiued for performance of capitulations, because peace assured,
is better then victorie hoped for. And here it shall not be impertinent
to remember that a yong Gentleman nephew to Marcus Bambalionus
remaining an hostage, by his discretion practised a peace with the enemie:
which by other mediation could not be compassed.

                  ¶Restitution of Souldiers persons.
                  
                     IT seemeth not reasonable that a souldier hauing endured
the fortune of warre, and therein also hazarded his owne
life, (falling into the enemies hand) should be depriued
of any priuiledge or profit to him due. The Emperours
Dioclesianus and Maximinianus commaunded that souldiers
taken by the enemy, and returned home, should be restored to all they lost,
although their goods were seazed and confiscate: yet diligent inquisition
to be made, whether that soldier were remaining with the enemy willingly,
or by force. In this case the opinion of Adrianus the Emperour is to be
allowed, saying, A souldier willingly taken and let loose, ought be returned
backe to the enemy: but if he were taken in seruice, and after escaped,
then ought he be restored to his former estate. But thereof good proofe is
to be made, for if before that time he had bene esteemed a faithful souldier,
then some credit ought be giuen him: but if hee were an Emansor, a man
negligent, or one that had bene long absent, & after returned, then should
he be little beleeued. The doubt therefore is, whether a souldier thus returned,
hath bene a fugitiue or a prisoner. In the one case he shalbe punished,
in the other he ought be restored and receiue his pay with recompence, as
a veteranus or old souldier. We conclude therefore that cōmon souldiers,
(and officers in the warre also) being deteined by the enemy, ought to be
fully restored, and participate of euery Donatiue or other liberality the

Prince shall please to bestow. And Vlpianus did thinke that such allowance
might be demanded in the name of the souldier remaining prisoner, if his
Attorny did so require. By the law Imperiall the same is also commanded,
and if a souldier together with his father and mother were taken prisoner,
the father and mother dying in prison, the sonne may (by the law Cornelia)
challenge their goods and lands. For considering his absence was occasioned
by seruice of the common-weale, he ought not only to receiue restitution
to his countrey, but also enioy his best fortune, with the greatest
reward can be reasonably required.

                  ¶Priuiledges anciently granted vnto Souldiers.
                  
                     SOuldiers were (by ancient custome) vnconstrained to pay
subsidies out of lands, confining or fronting vpon the enemies
countrey: and during their seruice in the field were excused
from all ordinary impositions, and taxations; also
from bestowing of gifts, and giuing of rewards.
                  Souldiers accused of any crime, ought not be tortured, or being found
gilty might not be hanged vpon any gallous or gibbet, before iudgement
were lawfully pronounced.
                  Souldiers were priuiledged from guing witnesse in twenty causes.
                  Souldiers during the warre, were free from prescription.
                  Souldiers ought to receiue restitution of all things taken from them, or
their wiues.
                  Souldiers were exempt from preuention of Iustice: and permitted to
vse priuiledge.
                  Souldiers could not be constrained to take tuition of another souldiers
children.
                  Souldiers were credited more then other men in the buying of wares for
their money.
                  Souldiers payed custome for the wares they caried, yet what a souldier
bare about him, was not subiect to confiscation.
                  Souldiers were not retained in prison, or forced to pay aboue their
power.
                  Souldiers were excusable of contumacie and supposed deceipt, yet if he
were called ought to appeare.

                  Souldiers might not be punished hauing about them any badge, or ensigne
of honour, but before punishment were inflicted, those badges were
taken away.
                  If any souldiers Attourney did make a contract or bargain, the souldier
was bound to performe it.

                  ¶Of Cassation and Dismission.
                  
                     THe Romanes vsed diuers Especes or kindes of Cassing, calling
one honourable, an other causary, and the third ignominious;
which diuers names did proceed from diuers reasons.
But first is to be considered that the Romane souldiers
were Legionary and perpetuall, but ours are onely voluntary
and temporal. Their Legions were continually in being without
discontinuance, euer in exercise, and in time of peace preparing for the
warre. But our bands do assemble extraordinarily and casually when perill
doeth approch, or when the Prince is pleased vpon any sudden to call
them. And as our souldiers are by vnlooked for occasion assembled, so are
they returned home, so soone as the warre (which was cause of their conuocation)
ceaseth. This is the reason that Cassation, which the Romanes
did accompt dishonorable or infamous, seemeth to vs little or no disgrace
at all. For indeed the Romanes did hold no dismission honourable, vnles
he who was dismissed did depart by licence of the Emperour or Generall,
and that with speciall grace and fauour. The Romane custome was also
such, as no man of Armes was Cassed with honour, vntill he had serued a
horseman tenne yeeres, a footman twenty yeeres, and sea souldiers twenty
fiue yeeres. In the end of which termes, the men of warre were licensed to
depart with commendation: (and for the most part) with recompense of
seruice, to some more, and to some lesse, according to their merits. From
which time forwards they continued or discontinued at their pleasure, or
if they were required to stay in the Legion, the same was by way of intreatie
and no compulsion, and during that abode, to be free from all seruices
and impositions, saue onely to fight with the enemie. Also whensoeuer
those men marched, they followed a particular Banner, purposely appointed
for old souldiers, leauing the Standard ordinary, and the Eagle. And
if they or any of them desired to returne vnto his owne house, they were
permitted so to doe, and receiued diuers priuiledges, confirmed and increased
by Constantine the great. Thus much concerning Cassing honourable.
                  Touching Cassation causary or reasonable, that was euer in consideration
of sicknesse or disability accidentall and vncurable, as if any Souldier
became blinde, or lame: or happened to haue any such impediment as
might make him vnfit for Armes.
                  Cassation ignominious, was for some offence or crime worthy of lesse
punishment then death: and who so was in that sort cassed, might no more
abide in Rome, nor approch the Emperiall Court. By an Edict of the Pretor,

a souldier was noted of infamy, if he departed from the Armie, and so
iudged by the commandement of the Emperour or generall Captaine:
and euery souldier so sent away, shalbe iudged infamous, whether he be a
common man, or a particular Captaine, or other inferiour commander.
Pomponius addeth, that if a Chieftaine or other officer (although he weare
the ensignes of a Consul) may be cassed with infamie and rest ignominious;
but the sentence of his discharge must be particularly expressed. After
the iudgement of Ignominie, he that is discharged, shall not be capable
of any office or dignitie. Traianus accounted no idle person or other man
noted of ignominie, worthy to enter his court. The Germanes will not permit
such a one to repaire vnto diuine seruice, to take any pay, to enioy priuiledge,
or haue ought to doe with the sword or other weapon; and neither
they nor their sonnes to haue any immunitie. Likewise a souldier that killeth
or woundeth himselfe, shalbe guiltie of ignominie. Iulius Caesar cassed
Caius Amenus a Tribune of souldiers in the tenth Legion, for inciting the
Romane souldiers to mutiny, and spoile a part of Italy; iudging him to be
ignominious and worthy to be banished. In ages more ancient, persons
condemned for infamie, were also let blood, nomine poenae.

                  ¶Of Iustice appertaining vnto
warre offensiue.
                  
                     MOst sure and certein it seemeth, that for diuision of people,
establishment of kingdomes, distinction of Signiories,
limitation of lands, and building of houses, the wars
were first deuised: yet is no warre iust vnlesse the same be
maintained by reason: for before Armes are taken in
hand, it behooueth to prooue all other meanes, by curtesie
and humanitie to compasse that which is desired. But because it falleth
out more then often, that the enemie cannot be perswaded by reason, nor
acknowledge to haue done wrong, and most seldome to make voluntary
restitution; no other hope of helpe resteth, then to force and constraine
him. For two wayes there be wherby we are to defend our selues; the one
by reason, which is proper to men; the other by force, which is common
to bruit beasts: So as the first not preuailing, it behooueth to vse the other.
And because man is so farre in loue with his owne affections, as commonly
he layeth hold of shadowes in stead of substance, inclining to that which
appeareth, in lieu of that is perfect, and preferreth passion before iudgement;
he thereby becommeth blind, as well in determining publike as priuate
affaires. Either else through a violent selfeloue, or a certaine insatiable

desire to possesse more then commeth to his share, he easily inclineth to
iniurie others, whensoeuer he may be Iudge in his owne cause: So hard a
thing is it for a man to determine between himselfe and others, as though
he were forced either to doe iniustice, or suffer it. Here of it commeth, that
as the fire doth naturally come forth of flints, being beaten one against another,
so the discord of mens affaires encountring, doth occasion so great
troubles as would vtterly ruine all, if by vertue of curtesie and moderation
the sharpnesse of reason were not reabated. Whereunto may be added,
that the successe of warres is euer doubtfull, notwithstanding the greatest
aduantages, and that warre may be begun how and when we will, yet can
it not be ended when and how the vanquisher pleaseth. So seemeth it in all
respects a great simplicity, or rather plaine folly to exchange tranquilitie
for trouble, being thereunto perswaded, by couetous desire or hopes vncertaine.
Concluding therefore, I say, that no warre offensiue ought be
enterprised without mature consideration, and for causes iust, not onely in
our owne conceit, but also irreprehensible in the conscience of the enemy.
And so shal euer be, if we do as we would be done vnto, entring into warre
for occasions ordinary, accustomed and receiued of all nations, viz. To
recouer those things which are vniustly deteined, and to force the authors
of iniury to be deliuered; if the same were not done by publike counsell
and consent; or for reuenge of iniuries enterprised against vs without
cause, and publikely; or for recouery of passage into forraine countreys,
paying al duties: for by law of Nations, passages ought be open to all men,
so long as the same may be without preiudice, or probable suspition.

                  ¶Of Iustice appertayning towarre defensiue.
                  
                     NO warre can be properly called defensiue, but that onely
which is made for defence of our selues, and to resist forain
inuasions: thereby also to assure, not onely vs and ours, but
also to protect Allies and neighbours vniustly oppressed:
whensoeuer they desire aide against those that wrongfully
and without cause will oppresse them. In all which cases this kind of warre
is iustifiable: because the same is warranted not onely by law of Nations,
but also by Iustice naturall, seeing nothing can be more reasonable and
lawfull then to repulse force with force. For apparant it is that euery creature
vntaught and without instruction, before it hath power to doe any
thing, will endeuour (in some sort) to repulse iniurie and violence, and
consequently saue it selfe. And very naturall it is in all men to be displeased,
when they are of others vnworthily & vnreasonably oppressed, which
is the cause that lawes doe permit that men in their owne defence may kill

those that shall assault them: so as the same be done with moderation, aud
that our perill cannot otherwise be eschewed. But here may be noted the
difference betweene defence and offence. For those whom we haue slaine
in the field and without intermission of time, are properly said to be slaine
in our defence, and is a thing allowable: but they that after the conflict are
killed, cannot be iudged slaine in our defence: because that warre or violence
is deemed offensiue, and therefore absolutely forbidden in euery
particular person, and the reuenge thereof appertaineth vnto authoritie
publique: which mooued Cicero to say, Iustum bellum est quibus necessarium,
& pia arma quibus nulla nisi in armis spes relinquitur. Nowe it resteth to tell
what warre is truely called iust and necessary. We say therefore that warre
to be necessarie when our enemy endeuoureth to take from vs those things
without which we cannot liue, or when they assaile vs with daily and dangerous
incursions. Secondly when they take from vs those things without
the which we cannot take comfort in our liues: as religion, libertie,
and iustice. Thirdly, when they take from vs those things wherein we haue
our only delight, as our children, our kinsfolke, our friends, our familiars,
and such commodities as we haue long enioyed, and without which, our
breath and being must needes be displeasing. In all which cases, it is more
then necessary for Princes to defend their subiects, and giue vnto al others
their friends and Allies aide, and protection.

                  ¶Of peace.
                  
                     IN diuers countreys, and amongst diuers people the
ceremonies and rites in confirming and establishing
of peace, truce and leagues, haue bene diuersly vsed.
We reade that the Grecians (after the death of Cyrus
the yonger) concluding a peace with Arieno a Commander
of certaine barbarous people, vsed these ceremonies.
First they caused a Bull, a Boare, a Wolfe,
and a ramme to be slaine, and laid them vpon a shield:
into the blood of those beasts the Grecians did dip their swords: and then
the Barbarians did put into the same blood their launces, either of them
promising and protesting to obserue fidelitie, friendship and societie.
                  The Kings of Armenia and Hiberia, to confirme peace betweene them,
consented the thombes of their right handes should be fast tied together,
which done, then either thombe was stricken with a knife, and the blood
comming out, they licked thereof in signe of mutuall loue. But the Romanes
did euer command that no peace should bee concluded without
consent of the Senate and people. For their custome was, that whensoeuer

peace was to be made, the Praetor, the Consul, or Senate, did deliuer vnto
the Foecial a certaine herbe called Verbena, or els grasse pulled vp by the
roote, and therewith some boughes of Verbena, together with a flint stone
taken out of the Temple of Iupiter Feretrius: which done the Foecial caused
a sowe to be brought into the market place, and holding a scepter in his
hand, like vnto Iupiter, and couering his head with a cloth, crowned himselfe
with a crowne of Verbena: Which rites being ended, he obtested and
beseeched Iupiter and Mars, and th'other gods, that if any of the parties
did faile to performe the capitulations, that then hee should be striken and
slaine like vnto the sow. After which obtestation her body was cut with
the flint: then they cast vpon it water and fire, and so the sacrifice was fully
solemnized according to the verse of Virgil,
                     Antiqui coesa firmabant foedera porca.
                  
                  
                     Menippus in his answere to Quintus Lincius the Consul, affirmed there
were three kinds of treaties. The first was, where the victorious in warre
did giue Lawes vnto him that was victored: for he who was most potent
in Armes, may euer dispose of all things at his discretion. The second was
when the aduersaries, being of equall force, the peace was concluded aequo
foedere, that is with equall conditions, and all things restored as they had
bene taken: and that he whose possession was by warre disturbed, should
be restored. Of this kinde were treaties betweene Octauius Caesar, Antonius
and Pompeius, and the conditions being signed and sealed were sent vnto
Rome, to rest in the custodie of the Virgins Vestall. The third kinde of treatie
is betweene those that neuer were enemies, and notwithstanding do
ioyne in league and amitie. In that case, if any of them were victorious or
victored, yet did they neither giue nor take Law, th'one from th'other.
                  The Tartarians concluding any peace or treatie, did sanctifie the same
in this sort. First they caused a Partizan, a sword or other weapon of warre
to be brought, and thereupon they took an oath, which done, they dranke
of the water wherein the Partizan, sword or other weapon was washed,
pronouncing these words, Quicunque pacta, & fraternitatem violarit, aut
contraeam violandam insurrexerit, vel aliquid intentauerit, àframeis incidendus,
occidendusque pereat, ac tanquam aqua, defluat, ac euanescat.
                  
                  The Lacedemonians confirmed their treaty with great sacraments, protesting
to obserue them iustly, simply, without fraud or deceit, and renued
the same yerely. As therefore treaties of this kinde doe binde either
party equally, so are they both equally and lawfully conioyned in the obligation.
                  Truce is a peace for a short time: to the end the enemie may take breath
and be aduised. Varro calleth truce an abstinence of Armes, and as it were
the holydayes of warre. For albeit the fight ceaseth, yet the warre continueth.
The terme of truce is neither more nor lesse, but as the enemies
shall agree. Lucius Pontius Generall of the Samnits, desired a truce for sixe
houres onely. The second truce betweene the Romanes and the Carthaginians
was to continue for fifty yeeres. The Vients also obteined a truce
of the Romanes for an hundreth yeeres. The first truce whereof we reade,
was taken in the reigne of Romulus when then Sabins made warre vpon the

Romanes vnder Titus Tacius their king. In which expedition certaine Ladies
of Rome were imployed and conducted by Hersilia, whose perswasion
preuailed with those kings. The nature of truce is such, as during the continuance
thereof, the enemies (without offending) may meete and speake
together. It is also lawfull for euery souldier (during that terme) to goe
and returne safe at his pleasure. But here is to be noted, that euery Treatie
as well of truce, as peace, ought be faithfull and sincere: and therefore I
much disallow Cleomenes king of Lacedaemon, who hauing concluded a
truce for an hundred and thirty daies, did neuerthelesse (in the night) spoile
the enemies countrey, alleaging the truce was made for dayes, but not
for nights; which crafty construction ought be misliked. Howsoeuer that
were, sure it is that no matter of State is of more difficultie, then the assurance
of Treaties, and leagues betweene Princes and common weales, either
friends or enemies, newters or subiects. For some require onely mutual
protestation or oath, others demand ostages: some would be possessed
of townes and strong places, and others would haue the enemy vtterly
disarmed; Yet experience hath proued that league to be best, which is ratified
by alliance and consanguinitie. But this subiect ought be discoursed
by doctors and expert polititians.

                  Of Licences and Pasports.
                  
                     IN certaine causes, and for some reasons, Captaines Generall
and other Commanders in the warre, were wont to
grant License vnto their souldiers to be absent from the armie,
or other places of seruice, with allowance of time conuenient,
for their going and returne. Yet true it is, that such
Licenses ought not to be giuen without earnest occasion, and for good respects,
whereunto we will adde, that meet it is, that not onely souldiers, but
also horses ought to be restrained, and seldome suffered to passe out of the
Armie. Neither ought any horse of seruice be employed in hunting, hauking,
or other needlesse exercise: for so was it decreed in the discipline of
Augustus. The Emperours Archadius and Honorius commanded all Captaines
and Commanders to be warie in giuing License to souldiers, chiefly
when the enemie is at hand, or when hee maketh incursion: for at such
times to giue License was accompted capital: or if any souldier did absent
himselfe from his Ensigne without leaue, that crime was also punished by
death. Licenses are therefore to be rarely granted, and for necessary considerations.
Yet no License may be denied, when vrgent occasion so requireth:
which error Appius Claudius the Decemuir incurred, when by his

letters he required that Luctus Virginius might not be suffered to come vnto
Rome: fearing he would accuse him for the rauishing his daughter: but
by good hap Virginius departed from the Armie one day before the letter
arriued there. Howsoeuer that were, yet true it is, that no souldier of anie
Armie well gouerned, ought demand Pasport or License to depart at any
vnseasonable time, neither should any Captain condescend to license him:
which moued Hannibal after the taking of Saguntum in Spaine, to proclaim
that euery souldier occasioned to goe vnto his countrey or friends, ought
before he went to desire license. Likewise by an Edict of Francis the French
king all souldiers were inhibited to goe from the Armie without License.
It was also the Romane vse, that euery souldier did aske leaue of his Captaine,
and the Captaine to haue License of the Generall of horse, or Captaine
general, before he departed from the Armie: also during his absence
to leaue a sufficient man to supplie the place, and he himselfe to returne at
the time prefixed: which done he receiued his whole pay without diminution,
as though hee had neuer bene absent. As touching the limitation
of time, and the number of souldiers who were licensed to be absent, we
reade that Scipio in the warre of Carthage gaue license vnto three hundred
Sicilian souldiers, and put three hundred other men to serue in their places:
and Francis the French king commanded, that more then thirty horsemen
should not be licensed to go from the Armie at one time: and they not to
be absent longer then three moneths, vpon paine to be checked of their
whole wages. William Rufus King of England did inhibit souldiers and all
other subiects of reputation to depart the land without leaue, which is yet
obserued.It seemeth by Pol. Virg. that rather the hand of God, then the King punished this attempt: for he was there slaine in the battell. And Polydor Virgil writeth that one Edward Wooduile (chiefe gouernour
of the Isle of Wight) for going forth of the Realme without license
was put to death vnder King Henrie the seuenth. But Zeno the Emperour
(punishing that offence more mildely) ordained, that if any souldier were
absent one whole yere without license, he should be put after tenne; if he
were absent two yeres, he should giue place to twenty; if three yeres, then
to be vtterly discharged from the Armie at his returne thither. Theodosius
and Valentinianus in that case, would not vtterly discharge them the Armie,
vntill foure yeeres absence was complete. If any souldier were sent
vnto a Prince to performe any seruice, and at his returne did signifie such
employment, together with his diligence to returne, in that case he ought
be excused, because his absence was by commandement, and in seruice of
the State, not for his owne profit or priuate commoditie. But who so for
his owne particular affaires is licensed and assigned a day of returne, in failing
thereof he shall be reputed a loyterer, or a fugitiue; vnlesse he be deteined
or otherwise iustly excused. To conclude therefore we say, that no
souldier departing from his Ensigne without leaue, can be excused, nor his
absence auowable, but when the same is for seruice of the prince or common
weale: as Scoeuola in his militarie Ordinances hath written.

                  ¶Of Ambassadours or Legats.
                  
                     THe office of an Ambassador was by the Romanes accounted
both honourable and sacred, including as well power
of commandement, as dignitie. Whensoeuer therfore any
Ambassadour did come to Rome, he was first brought vnto
the Temple of Saturnus, there to haue his name written
before the Praefectiaerarij: from thence he went to deliuer his legation vnto
the Senate. But first it ought be remembred, that men meetest to be employed
for Ambassadours, are they indeed who are of most sagacitie and
greatest skill how to discouer the counsels and designes of the enemy. Scipio
Africanus hauing occasion to send an ambassage to Syphax, elected certaine
Tribunes and Centurions, and caused them to be basely apparelled.
Cato beholding certaine Ambassadors to be sent by the Senate to compound
a peace betweene Nicomedes and Prusias, the one of them had his
headfull of skarres, the second was impotent of his feet, & the third timersome,
said, This Legation hath neither good head, feet, nor heart. Ambassadours
ought be in all countreys inuiolable: in signe whereof they anciently
caried about them the herbe Sagmen, which we call Veruen, to shewe
they were sacred, and that no man should dare to lay hold on them; & who
so offred them violence, was thought to haue done contrary to law of Nations.
Which moued Publius Mutius to command, that whosoeuer did strike
an Ambassadour, should be deliuered vnto that enemy from whome the
Ambassadour was sent. And though the enemy receiued him not, yet
should he remaine an exile, as if he were interdicted from fire and water,
according to the sentence of Publius Mutius. Yet doe we read, that Dioscorides
and Scrapion Ambassadors sent from Caesar to Achillas, so soone as they
came within his sight, and before he heard them, or for what affaires they
were sent, commanded them to be taken and slaine. Caesar likewise sent
Marcus Valerius Porcillus vnto king Ariouistus, who being there arriued, was
presently taken and put into prison, notwithstanding he were a young man
of great vertue and curtesie. Likewise Comius Attrebas being sent by Caesar
into Britane, was cast into prison by the Britanes. Laërtes Tolumnius king
of Vients, did 
                        •
                     lea foure Ambassadours of Rome, whose portraitures remained
long in the market place. Such honour the Romanes vsed to giue
vnto those men that dyed for their country. Alexander the Great besieging
a Citie called Tyrus, sent Ambassadours vnto the inhabitants thereof, who
contrary to the lawe of Nations, slewe them, and from an high tower cast
downe their bodies.

                  ¶Of prisoners taken by the enemie.
                  
                     WHo so is taken in the warre, ought by the law of Nations to
be reputed a lawfull prisoner: yet if afterwards hee escape
and returne home, he recouereth his former estate. They
that are thus taken, were by the Romanes called Serui, quod
seruantur: as much to say, as being taken, they ought be kept,
not killed: whereof may bee inferred, it is vnlawfull to kill a man hauing
yeelded himselfe: because that acte is inhumane, and all great Captaines
haue forbidden it, according to the saying of Horace, Vendere cum possis captiuum
occidere noli. Herein also wee are to follow the example of ancient
Princes and chiefe commanders in warre. Alexander the Great tooke to
wife Roxanes whom he had taken prisoner in the warre. Henry the seuenth
king of England hauing taken Lambert a king of Ireland together with his
schoolemaster, pardoned both their liues; the one because he was a childe,
the other a person Ecclesiasticall and dedicated to God: so sayth Polydor
Virgil. Romulus made a law, that cities taken by warre should not be vtterly
demolished, nor all beasts in the field slaine: but setling there certaine
Colonies, they did participate of the commodities with the naturall people.
Yet true it is, that some conquerors haue anciently vsed great crueltie.
For reade wee may, that the Africans caused many Cathaginians their
prisoners, together with their Captaine Gestones, to haue their hands cut
off and their legs broken with a wheele. Likewise Hasdrubal after Megarae
was recouered from the Romanes, caused their eyes, their tongues, & secret
parts to be torne with yron hookes: he also cut off their fingers and flayed
their bodies; and before they were dead, hung them vpon the walles. We
may also here remember the terrible custome of the Thuliti, who vsed to
sacrifice the bodies of men taken in warre, as an oblation to the gods most
acceptable. Howsoeuer these people handled the matter, it is, no doubt,
lawfull for men that are victorious, peaceably to rule and command those
that are victored. And Ariouistus answering Caesar, sayd, that the people of
Rome vsed to command nations conquered, according to their owne discretion,
not the d
                        •
                     rection of others. Who so therfore falleth into the hands
of an enemy, becommeth his captiue: neither can he be owner of any thing
when he himselfe is possessed by another. This only remaineth, that in him
there resteth a right and title to his owne, notwithstanding possession be
lost. Here we may also remember, that all places taken by the enemy, doe
cease to be sacred or religious, yet being deliuered from that calamity, they
returne to their former estate Iure postliminio. Therefore seeing the graues
of the enemy are not to vs sacred, the violation of them do beare no action.

                  Of rescuing and ransome of Prisoners.
                  
                     IF any souldier be taken, and by aide of others rescued,
he ought not remaine prisoner to the rescuers,
but shall forthwith be restored to liberty, and enioy
his former estate: for souldiers must be defenders
of fellowes in Armes, not their masters. Likewise
if any stranger do redeeme a prisoner from the enemy,
the souldier redeemed shall not be accounted
the strangers prisoner, but remaine with him as a
pledge vntill the ransome be paid: for so was it decreed by Gordianus the
Emperour. If a woman prisoner be redeemed from the enemy, and marieth
with him that redeemeth her, in that case, she and her children shall be
discharged, both of bondage and paiment of money. If any man shall redeeme
a prisoner taken by the enemy, the prisoner is forthwith at liberty,
and the redeemer shall be compelled to accept the price offered, without
further question. If a man contracteth marriage with a woman his prisoner,
hee shall be iudged to haue forgiuen her ransome. Yet if a dishonest
woman redeeme her daughter from the enemie, and (knowing her to be
honest) shall deliuer her to be dishonoured, and the daughter (to preserue
her chastity) fleeth to her father: in that case the mother maketh her selfe
vnworthy to receiue the prize, in respect of her lewd intention, and the
daughter shalbe restored freely to her liberty. This is also a rule generall,
that a freeman taken by the enemy and redeemed, so soone as his ransome
be paid, or his body by other meane set at liberty, he thereby recouereth his
former estate, in the meane space although the ransome is not fully satisfied,
yet may he challenge his right of succession, so as thereby hee shall
in time be able to discharge the debt. Moreouer, if he who redeemeth a
prisoner, shall remit the bondage of his pawne, yet is not the redeemed at
libertie, from his redeemer, albeit he be restored to that freedome which
formerly he had lost: but hee shall not be compelled to doe seruice vnto
the children of the redeemer. The first beginning to giue ransome for redeeming
of captiue Souldiers was after the defeate of Canna, at which
time Hannibal did grant leaue that the Romanes might ransome themselues.
The price then of a horseman was fiue hundred pieces of money,
a footman three hundred, and for a seruant one hundred. And if any moneys
or other goods were left in deposito, or giuen to redeeme a captiue,
they might be lawfully demanded during an hundred yeeres after. Neither
ought it be thought strange that a part or an whole inheritance belonging
vnto a captiue, and left vnto persons vnknowne, ought be bestowed

to redeeme him. For heretofore the Emperours, moued with pitie and
compassion of poore Souldiers misaduentures, haue by Law decreed that
an whole inheritance may be giuen to ransome captiues: because nothing
should be withholden from redeeming men that haue endured the fortune
of warre in defence of our countrey.

                  ¶Of Enemies.
                  
                     WE properly call those people enemies, that publiquely do
make warre vpon vs, or against whom we make warre:
yet theeues and robbers cannot be named enemies, neither
may they be reputed captiues that are taken or kept
by theeues, and being set at liberty shall not need to be
restored by Postliminium. But who so is taken in the warre
is a prisoner vnto his taker, and being set at libertie by the Law of Postliminium
shall recouer his former estate.
                  The people that moued warre against the Romanes, were euer thereunto
mooued, either by ambition, as the Parthians, or by desire of libertie as
the Germans, by whom at length the Romane Empire was subuerted. The
Athenians vsed to contend with some enemies for victory: but with the
Barbarians they fought vntill death, because they were reputed their greatest
enemies, to whom if any man did giue aide, or meanes to spoyle the
countrey, he was burned aliue: if he sold any port or hauen, he deserued
losse of life: and he that furnished the enemy with hay or come, was likewise
capitally punished. The Romanes would not receiue conditions
from any enemy being in Armes: because (as Quintus Cicero said) an enemie
ought with hands and feete to be repulsed. In Macedon a Law there
was that whosoeuer did returne from the warre, and had not slaine an enemie,
should be strangled with a cord. The Scythians had an vse, that at solemne
feastes, no man should drinke of the great cup which was caried about,
vnlesse he had slaine an enemy. The Iberi had a custome to set about
the tombe of euery dead man, so many Pyramids, as he had slaine enemies.
The Persians made a Law, that Explorators and spies, in consideration of the
dangers they indured, should be mainteined by publique contribution.
And albeit the hate which enemies haue one towards the other be great,
yet the Indians in time of warre, did refraine to vse force against Plowmen,
or molest them, being reputed ministers of common vtility. Pomponius
writeth, that in Rome it was not lawfull for any man to passe out of the City
by other way then the gates: for otherwise doing he should be reputed an
enemy, which was the cause that moued Romulus to kill his brother Remus,
                     
when he climed vpon the wall: yet was hee no enemy. Howsoeuer that
was, Martianus affirmeth resolutely, that wheresoeuer a fugetiue is found,
there may he lawfully be killed as an enemy: yet is he not so called.
               
               
                  CHAP. 34.
                  ¶Of immunities Militarie.
                  
                     ALbeit vnfit it were, that souldiers discontinuing the warre,
whom we formerly called Emansores, or other men newly
entred into that profession should be protected or excused
from payment of debts, or otherwise priuiledged, yet meet
it is, that men of long and loyall seruice should be in some
sort borne with, and fauoured. In that case therefore diuers immunities
haue bene anciently granted vnto souldiers of great seruice or good merit,
as appeareth by diuers decrees made by the Emperours Seuerus and Antoninus,
who dispensed with an execution awarded against one man called
Marcellus, commanding that his pay should not be arested to the vse of his
creditors: if other meane of satisfaction might be found. Because the law
compelleth souldiers to pay only so much as they are able, yet that fauour
extendeth not to all men professing armes, but those in particular, that
haue serued long, and for such debtes as they incurred, during the time
they continued in the warre. Here is it also to be remembred, that no gift
bestowed for seruice, may be vpon any priuate contract, impawned. For
if the creditor can be otherwise satisfied, then the law determineth no execution
shall be taken vpon gifts or goods bestowed for seruice, anciently
reputed sacred: which reason mooued the most Christian king Francis to
make an Edict, whereby he commanded, that vnto such souldiers as wanted
money, victuall should be sold in credit: but, if after a conuenient time
that debt were not payd, then the Treasorer should make stay of the souldiers
pay, and deliuer it vnto the creditor. Likewise Charles the seuenth
did forbid, that the Armes of souldiers should be sold to satisfie creditors.
The law of Graecia did also inhibit the taking of Armes for satisfaction of
debt: yet by the same law power is permitted vnto creditors to arrest any
souldiers person that is indebted. The same lawe likewise commaundeth
that no artificer appertaining to the warre, should be personally imprisoned
for money, yet was it lawfull to extend his goods. Solon in his law called
Sisacthia made for the Athenians, seemeth to thinke it vnreasonable,
that the body of any Citizen should be imprisoned vpon debt due for vsurie.
Summarily therefore we say, That souldiers are bound to pay so much
as they are able, and no more: which happily mooued Tertullianus to affirme
that who so hath possession of any stocke of goods (chiefly appertaining
vnto the warre) he may be forced to pay vnto his creditors, so much

as is properly his owne, but not take any thing belonging vnto the State:
neither is it lawfull for the father to sell the lands or goods entayled or assured
in perpetuum vnto his heires, as Papinianus hath written.
               
               
                  CHAP. 35.
                  ¶Of Captaines generall, Marshals, and
other chiefe Commanders.
                  
                     IN Athens a man called Dionysiodorus did take vpon him to
reade an art of conducting and trayning souldiers, which
skill albeit he had knowen, yet could he not enforme any of
his auditory how to become a good Commander: because
the leading of men is indeede the least part of Commanding.
For it behoueth a Generall not only to conduct an armie, but also to
prouide things needfull both for the warre, and mainteining of men. A
carefull chieftaine therefore is to shew himselfe patient, prudent, cautious,
liberall, and such a one as loueth more to giue then to keepe. Homer vsed
to call Agamemnon a Pastor of people, because he carefully intended the
safety of his Army. Antonius for many qualities no commendable Emperour,
yet in one point much to be praised, because he liked better to be
called a companion of armes, then a Prince. He also sometimes vouchsafed
to march on foot, and in his owne hand carry the generall ensigne of
the armie, which was of great poyze, and not to be borne of the strongest
souldiers, without much paine. Theodosius the Emperor did not command
the meanest souldier to do any thing, but that he himselfe would sometimes
doe: wherein he performed the part of a stout souldier, and an excellent
chiefetaine: which example percase mooued ancient men of warre (after
victory) to elect their Emperour, out of the number of notable souldiers:
for so it seemeth Germanicus was aduanced. We likewise reade that Tiberius
was pleased to consent that Blesus should be called of the Legions
Imperator, for that was the ancient title due to Commanders generall. The
historie of Maximinus sheweth, that he became preferred by the warre,
being borne of obscure parents in Thracia, and (as some write) the sonne
of a shepheard. Yet because he was a man of great fortune, courage and
strength, by the degrees of warre he aspired to gouerne many Countreys.
After that time, he became Liuetenant generall vnto Alexander: and in
the end, by the Romane armie chosen Emperour. Thus much concerning
generall Commanders, aduanced for proper vertue.
                  
                     Plato in his common weale, wisheth a Chiefetaine to be elected in this
sort; A General of horse (saith he) ought be made by consent of the whole
Armie. The Praefecti whom we call great commanders, were elected by
those souldiers that bare targets: The Tribunimilitum had their aduancement

by voice of men at armes: and other Captains of meaner place were
appointed by the chiefe General. The horsemen did euer giue their voyces
first, in presence of the foot bands, and two of them that gained most
voices, were appointed to commaund the rest. The Captaines also did
name him for Emperour, that was in seruice most painefull, in perill most
resolute, in action most industrious, in execution most quicke, and in
counsell most prouident. In this election no respect was had, whether
the person elected were a Senator, or recommended by the Senate, because
the qualities aforesayd sufficed to make a Generall, as appeared in
Maximinus the Emperour: in whose election the Senate did not intermeddle.
That General therefore seemeth of most sufficiencie, who knoweth
(as a souldier) how to offend his enemie, gouerne his owne forces, endure
heate and cold, sleepe on the ground, patiently suffer both labour
and lacke. For sometimes we see, that he who hath authority to command,
needeth another to command him. Some others also are called to authoritie,
and command in the warre, before they haue skill how to doe it, or
haue read any precepts military, or are by the rules of predecessors enformed.
For a matter of more difficultie it is to know what appertaineth vnto
a Captaine, then to execute the office of that place, seeing skill must precede
action, and vse goe before commandement. In this point we haue
heard Francis the French king much commended, who kept in memorie
the historie of all his predecessors: and to witnesse his proper valor, at the
battel of Pauia (wherin albeit he was vnfortunate) yet with his owne hand
he slew a German Ensignebearer, to his eternall glory. It seemeth therefore
expedient, for all Princes and commanders in warre, to be well studied
in histories, and chiefly those that concerne the actions of their ancestors;
which perhaps moued Edward the third, king of England, at such
time as he made warre vpon Robert the second, king of Scots, to command
a certaine Monke to attend his Maiestie in that expedition, and with his
penne to expresse in verse (being indeed an excellent Poet) all the actions
and proceedings of that enterprise. Mahomet the second, king of Turkie,
endeuoured much to know the histories of his predecessors, and gaue
bountifull rewards vnto one writer called Iohn Maria of Vincenza, for expressing
the victorie he obtained against Vssancassan king of Persia, as Paulus
Iouius noteth: much more praise and honour is due vnto those Captaines
that haue by long seruice and due degrees of warre deserued the titles
appertaining to armes, and beare about them the scarres and tokens of
true valour. Adrianus the Emperour would not permit any man to bee a
Tribune, or take charge in the warre, whose beard was not full growen, or
whose witte or yeres were vncapable of that office: neither would he suffer
a Captaine to take any thing from his souldier.
                  Among many other parts of commendation required in a soueraigne
commander, there is not any more to bee honoured then liberalitie: and
contrariwise auarice ought to be extreamely abhorted. For hard it is to attend
the affaires of warre, and ouer much to affect money. Great reason
therefore had Nicomedes to thinke himselfe vsed with indignitie by the Bithynians,
when he hauing borne all the offices of warre, and was wounded

in many places of his body, was then repulsed. All which notwithstanding,
Antisthenes was preferred, and made General, when hee had
neuer performed any action praise worthy or memorable, nor had endeuoured
more then to make himselfe mighty in mony: yet is not that Captaine
to be misliked, that can with honour and good conscience purchase
wealth, for thereby he hath meane and power to supply the wants, both of
priuate souldiers, and publique scarcitie. The office of a souereigne Commander,
may be compared vnto the skill of him that gouerneth well a priuate
house: which is to command things fit, to make men obedient, to reward
the good and punish the euill. In which offices, the one and the other
of these commanders shall not faile to finde enemies, and therefore
may be called a warre. Here may we also remember that the Mauritanes
being confederate with Iustinianus the Emperour, consented that no man
should be their Generall, but such a one as was a friend vnto the Romanes,
or had receiued the Ensignes from a commander of the Romane armie,
which were these: A staffe of siluer gilded: a cuppe of leather ornified with siluer:
and a white vesture of small price.
                  
                  The Romanes called these officers Magistri militum, or Praefecti, when
they were sent to gouerne an army against the enemy, or to giue counsell
in the warre, or had in charge to dispose of the campe: for so was it decreed
by Honorius and Theodosius Sometimes also their lieutenants were called
Praefecti, hauing in charge the defence of a particular prouince against the
enemie, and were in authoritie equall to him that led the army called Dux,
and before the Proconsul. To this dignity, Cabades being restored vnto the
kingdome of Persia, preferred Selanem a man of great fame and reputation
in the warre, and therefore called him Seosen, which is the title of that Magistrate
who commandeth all sorts of souldiers, as the Constable doeth in
France, and the High Marshall in England. The office of the Tribunes in
Rome, was, to hold the soldiers in order, to see them trained, to keepe the
keyes of gates, to suruey the watch, to dispose of the vittaile, to correct false
measures, to punish offenders according to the quality of their faults, to behold
often the order of the army, to here the quarels in question betweene
souldiers, and to visit the sicke. For in deed the office of euery commander
consisteth in doing iustice and obseruation of discipline. He is also to be
spare in giuing licence vnto Souldiers, or to permit any horses to passe
out of his countrey, neither should he suffer them to be employed in hunting,
hauking, or such like exercises, a matter specially inhibited by the discipline
of Augustus. A soueraigne Magistrate militarie, ought also to remember,
that after his commission be expired, he ought not to depart the
place of his charge, within the space of fiftie dayes: for so doing without
licence of his superior, he incurreth an offence capital: such
was the instruction which Zeno the Emperor did giue vnto
Sebastianus, notwithstanding his authority was
ceassed, and a successor come to receiue
charge of the Armie.

                  The Prooeme.
                  
                     FOrasmuch as the Actions of Armes
(chiefly on horsebacke) are, and euer
haue been vsed of Noble personages,
and Gentlemen of best quailitie, whom
the Romanes in their flourishing time
by a generall tearme called Equites,
and are presently of the Italians and
Spaniards named Caualieri, without
respect of priuate dignitie, or other distinction:
wee will for this time (yet
with respect, and vnder correction) aduenture to English the word Eques,
a Gentleman that professeth honour, vertue, and Armes, or any
of them: particularly discoursing of what qualitie hee ought bee, as followeth.
                  First, he must be of good constitution and conuenient strength to endure
trauell in Actions appertaining to Souldiers.
                  Secondly, he should be well fauoured of face and comely: for commonly
God and Nature giueth beauty to such persons as are destined to command,
and from others borne to obey, hee hath withholden that fauour,
which moued some writers to affirme, that the princely presence of Priamus
did shew him to be worthy of gouernement, and to commaund other
men.
                  Thirdly, hee should be of bold aspect, rather inclined to seuerity then
softnesse: which countenace the Swisses and Turkes do much affect.
                  Fourthly, hee must be sober, and discreete, not inclined to vaine delights
or effeminate pleasures.
                  
                     
Fiftly, hee ought bee obedient: for of obedience proceedeth that the
meaner are content to bee commanded by the better, and the ignorant
by those that know. This vertue was greatly imbraced of the Romanes,
and occasioned their often victories. For the punishment of disobedience
inflicted by military Magistrates, the Romanes haue left two most notable
examples: the one of Manlius Torquatus, who caused his owne
sonne, for that fault to be slaine, notwithstanding he had vanquished the
enemie: The other of Papirius the Dictator, who for the like offence
was punished by Fabius Rutilius General of the horsemen in the Romane
Armie.
                  Sixtly, hee ought hee vigilant, and patient: for in the one consisteth
the execution of warlike Actions: by the other all trauailes, paines, and
misfortunes are endured.
                  Seuenthly, he must be faithfull and loyall, which qualitie is required in
all sorts of subiects, but chiefly in souldiers: for thereupon dependeth his
Princes securitie, and State also, which moued Vegetius to say, That the
safety of a Prince consisteth in the well chusing his souldiers. This is the
cause, that men professing Armes, doe commonly sweare by the faith of a
Souldier: The French man, a foy de Soldat: The Italian, a fe di
Soldato &c. Yea the Kings of France doe commonly vse this phrase,
a foy de gentil homme: a foy du cheualier.
                  
                  Eightly, he ought be constant and resolute, because resolution maketh
all difficulties easie, and constancie or perseuerance bringeth perfection in
that he professeth.
                  Ninthly, that he should be charitable, because warres are not taken in
hand for the destruction of Countries, and towns, but the defence of lawes
and people.
                  Lastly, he should bee fortunate, sith Fortune is the Ladie of Armes,
and sheweth her power in nothing more then in the aduentures of
warre.
               
               
                  
                  CHAP. 1.
                  Of Knighthood.
                  
                     WHo so desireth to knowe the originall name
and dignitie of Knighthood, it behooueth
him to be enformed, that the Romanes, among
whom Martiall discipline was first
esteemed, and titles giuen to men for valorous
merit, diuided their people into Patritij
and Plebaei. After that time, another diuision
was made, as Senatores, Equites, and Plebs: as
the French haue at this day Les Nobles & la
populaire, or Gentils hommes & villains. And
we in England doe diuide our men into fiue
sorts: Gentlemen, Citizens, Yeomen, Artificers, and Labourers. Of Gentlemen,
the first and principal is the King, Prince, Dukes, Marquesses, Earls,
Vicounts, and Barons. These are the Nobilitie, and be called Lords, or
Noblemen. Next to these be Knights, Esquiers, and simple Gentlemen,
which last number may be called Nobilitas minor: for they in Parliament
haue no place among the Lords; therefore the Barons or degree of Lords
doe resemble the dignity of Senatores in Rome, and the title of our Nobilitie
is like vnto Patritij, when the Patritij did signifie Senatores aut Senatorum
filij. But that degree which we doe now call Knighthood, is most like
vnto the title in Rome named Equestris ordo. Yet other opinions there are,
both of the beginning and name of Knight, as well among the Italians as
the Spaniards. But howsoeuer it was, most certaine it seemeth, that vntill
Equestris ordo was erected in Rome, there was no such degree of men as we
call Knights, neither was that name giuen with such ceremony and shewe
of dignitie, as since it hath beene vsed. Yet some there are that faile not to
affirme, that Knighthood had the originall from Romulus, in this sort.
                  That King hauing set led his gouernment in Rome, partly for security, and
partly for magnificence erected three bands of horsemen; the first called
Romence after his owne name, the next Titience after Titus Tacius, and the
third Luceria, whereof only I thinke Liuie maketh mention. Hereupon they
will inferre, that Knighthood begun vnder Romulus.
                  
                  The Spaniards doe hold opinion, that when faith and plaine dealing decayed,
those men that made profession of warre, euery thousand did chuse
one man whom they thought to be of greatest wisdome, courage, and curtesie
among the rest. That being done, they made choise of such an horse
as was reputed to excell the rest, for beautie, force, and other perfections,

and forthwith gaue that beast vnto that man whome they had chosen: as
though their intention were to conioyne that singular beast vnto that notable
man: naming him Caualiero, which signifieth Horseman, though we
improperly English it Knight.
                  Thus much is said in generall concerning gentlemen that make profession
of Armes, whom the Romanes (as it seemeth) sometimes called Milites,
and some other times Equites: the Italians and Spaniards Caualieri, the
French Cheualiers: but in our language (as is now vsed) none are called
Knights, but only they that haue that title giuen by the Prince or his Lieutenant,
with a ceremony thereunto belonging. And of Knights made according
to the vse of England, are diuers degrees, as shall hereafter bee
declared.
               
               
                  CHAP. 2.
                  ¶The originall of Knighthood giuen as a Dignity:
and what Princes haue authoritie
to make Knights.
                  
                     IT is affirmed by some writers, that Alexander the Great
with the aduise of his learned tutor Aristotle, resolued to
bestow vpon such persons as performed any notable seruice
in the warre, certaine honours and aduancements, in
token of their extraordinary vertue and notable merit: and
therefore he gaue vnto some badges, to some chaines, to some immunities,
or some such other demonstration of fauour and honour.
                  The Romane Emperours in like manner sometimes before the beginning
of a seruice, and sometimes after, bestowed not only commendation,
but also dignity on those whose vertue they thought so worthy: as crowns
of Bayes, of Golde, of Myrtle, or some other gift thought fit by the giuer.
They gaue also horses, swords, armour, arming coats, and such like: & they
that receiued them as a token of honour, kept them carefully in perpetuall
memory of their valour, and the honour of the Prince that gaue them. By
this meane also they became much admired and esteemed of other souldiers.
                  Afterwards, for more encouragement of vertuous minds, other Princes
thought good that the memorable acts of soldiers should be in perpetuall
memory written, and such priuiledges as were giuen them to be recorded,
calling them in those writings, Valiant men, Companions in Arms, Victorious
souldiers and Knights. Which maner of proceeding did encourage
the men of warre, no lesse then the great pou
                        •
                     traitures which the most ancient
Romanes made for those that had performed actes egregious.
                  
                     
Touching the making of Knights, we say, That euery Prince souereigne
hath power to giue that dignitie to what person it pleaseth him, as well in
time of peace as warre. But here is to be noted, that the Knights made, are
of more or lesse reputation according to the qualitie of that Prince that
made them. For he that is made knight by a King, shall be preferred before
a knight made by a Prince of meaner title. To conclude therefore we say,
that all Emperours, Kings, Dukes and other Princes acknowledging no
Superiour, may make Knights, and so may common-weales, as the State
of Venice and Genoa. The Popes doe also sometimes make Knights for money:
calling them commonly after their owne names: Caualieri di San Pietro,
San Paulo, Guiliani, Pij. &c.
                  
               
               
                  CHAP. 3.
                  The maner of making Knights about the yeere
of Christ 500. neere which time King Arthur
reigned in England.
                  
                     IN that age, a Prince determining to make a Knight, did
command a Scaffold or Stage to be builded in some Cathedrall
Church of his kingdome, or other spacious place
neere vnto it. Thither the Gentleman was brought to receiue
that honour: and being come, was forthwith placed
in a chaire of siluer, adorned with greene silke. Then was demaunded of
him if he were healthy of bodie, and able to endure the trauell required in
a souldier: also whether he were a man of honest conuersation, and what
witnesses worthy credit he could produce so to affirme. That being done,
the Bishop or chiefe Prelate of the Church tooke the Bible, and holding it
open before the Knight, in presence of the King and all others spake these
words: Sir, you that desire to receiue the order of Knighthood, sweare before
God, and by this holy booke, that ye shal not fight against this mightie
and excellent Prince that now bestoweth the order of Knighthood vpon
you, vnlesse you shall be commanded so to do, in the seruice of your owne
King and naturall Prince: for in that case, hauing first yeelded vp the coller,
deuice and other ensignes of honour now receiued, it shall be lawfull for
you to serue against him, without reproch, or offence to all other companions
in Armes: but otherwise doing, ye shall incurre infamy, and being
taken in warre, shall be subiect to the paines of death. Ye shall also sweare
with all your force and power to maintaine and defend all Ladies, Gentlewomen,
Orphans, Widdowes, women distressed and abandoned. The
like must ye doe for wiues, being desired, and shun no aduenture of your
person, in euery good warre wherein ye happen to be.
                  
                     
This oath taken, two of the chiefe Lords led him vnto the King, who
presently drew foorth his sword and layd the same vpon the Gentlemans
head, and said, God and Saint George (or what other Saint the King pleased
to name) make thee a good Knight. Then came vnto the Knight, seuen
noble Ladies, attired in white, and girt a sword vnto his side.
                  That done, foure Knights of the most honourable in that presence put
on his spurs.
                  These Ceremonies past, the Queene tooke him by the right arme, and
a Dutchesse by the left, and led him vnto a rich seat made on high, and
thereupon set him, the King sitting downe on the right hande, and the
Queene on the other.
                  After the King and Queene were thus set, and the new Knight between
them, al the rest of the Lords and Ladies sate downe also vpon other seats
prepared for them, three descents vnder the kings seat.
                  Euery Lord and Lady being thus placed, thither was brought a solemn
collation or banquet of delicate meates, whereof the Knight, the King, the
Queene, and whole company did eate. And so the ceremony ended.
               
               
                  CHAP. 4.
                  The degradation of Knights in those daies.
                  
                     IF any Knight at that time had bene corrupted with
money by his Princes enemy, or committed any other
notable fact against loyaltie and honour, the other
Knights forthwith made humble suite vnto the
king that he might be punished. Which request being
granted, they apprehended the offendour, and
caused him to be armed from head to foot, and in such
sort as if he were going to the field. Then they led
him vp to an high stage made in a Church for that purpose, where thirtie
Priests soung such Psalmes as are vsed at burials, as though the Knight had
lien dead at their feete. At the end of euery Psalme they tooke from him
one piece of armour. First they tooke off his Helmet as that which de
                        •
                     ended
his traiterous eyes, then his gauntlet on the right side, as that which
couered a corrupt hand: then his gauntlet on the left side, as from a member
consenting, and by peecemeale dispoiled him of all his Armes as well
offensiue as defensiue, which one after another were thrown to the ground:
and at the instant when any peece of armour was cast downe, the King of
Armes first, and after him all other Heralds cryed aloud, saying, this is the
head-peece of a disloyall and miscreant Knight. Then was brought thither
a basen of golde or siluer full of warme water: which being holden vp, the
Heralds with a loud voice saide, What is the Knights name? The Purseuants

answered that which in trueth was his name. Then the chiefe King
of Armes said, That is not true, for he is a miscreant and false traitour, and
hath transgressed the ordinances of Knighthood. Thereunto answered
the Chaplains, Let vs giue him his right name. Then spake the Trumpets,
What shall be done with him? To which wordes the King answered, Let
him with dishonour and shame be banished my kingdome as a vile and infamous
man that hath offended the honour of Knighthood. So soone as
the King had so said, the King of Armes and other Heralds cast the warme
water vpon the disgraded Knights face, as though he were new baptized,
saying, Henceforth thou shalt be called by thy right name, Traitour. Then
the King with twelue other Knights put vpon them mourning garments,
declaring sorow: and comming vnto the Knight disgraded, put him downe
the Stage, not by the stayers hee mounted vp when he was made Knight,
but threwe him downe tyed vnto a rope. Then with great ignominy hee
was brought vnto the Altar, and there layd groueling on the ground, and
ouer him was read a Psalme full of curses.
               
               
                  CHAP. 5.
                  ¶Of Knights of the Round Table.
                  
                     ABout the yeere of Christ 490. there raigned in England
(then called Britaine) a King named Arthur,
whose valour was so great, and admirable, as many
men now liuing, doe hold the same rather fabulous
then credible. Yet whoso shall consider enterprises
of later time atchieued by priuate persons, may be
easily induced to thinke that a great part of praise
written of that mighty Monarche, may reasonably
receiue beleefe. But omitting to speake of his prowesse (percase already
by others ouerlargely discoursed) I say that this most famous King hauing
expulsed out of England the Saxons, conquered Norway, Scotland, and the
most part of France, was crowned in the Citie of Paris. From whence returned,
he erected a certaine Association or brotherhood of Knights: who
vowed to obserue these Articles following.
                  First, that euery Knight should be well armed, and furnished to vndertake
any enterprise wherein he was employed, by Sea or land, on horsebacke
or foot.
                  That he should be euer prest to assaile all Tyrants, and oppressours of
people.
                  That he should protect widowes
                        •
                     and maidens; restore children to their
right: repossesse such persons as were without iust cause exiled, and withall
his force maintaine the Christian faith.
                  
                     
That he should be a Champion for the weale publique, and as a Lion
repulse the enemies of his countrey.
                  That he should aduance the reputation of honour, and suppresse al vice,
releeue people afflicted by aduerse fortune, giue aide to holy Church, and
protect pilgrimes.
                  That he should bury Souldiers that wanted sepulture, deliuer prisoners,
ransome captiues, and cure men hurt in seruice of their countrey.
                  That he should in all honourable actions, aduenture his person, yet with
respect to iustice and trueth, and in all enterprises proceed sincerely, neuer
failing to vse his vttermost force of body, and valour of minde.
                  That after the atteyning of any enterprise, he should cause it to be recorded,
to th'end the fame of that fact might euer liue, to his eternall honour,
and renowne of the Noble order.
                  That if any complaint were made at the Court of this mighty King of
iniury, or oppression, then some knight of the Order, whō the king should
appoint, ought reuenge the same.
                  That if any knight of forraine nation did come vnto the Court with desire
to challenge, or make shew of his prowesse, that then (were he single,
or accompanied) these knights ought be ready in Armes to make answere.
                  That if any Lady, Gentlewoman, Widow, Maiden or other oppressed
person did present a petition declaring they were, or had bene in this or
other nation iniured, or offered dishonour, they should bee gratiousty
heard, and without delay, one or more Knights should bee sent to make
reuenge.
                  That euery Knight should bee willing to enforme yong Princes, Lords
and Gentlemen in the orders, and exercises of Arms, therby not only to auoid
idlenes, but also to increase the honor of Knighthood and Chiualrie.
                  Diuers other Articles inciting to magnanimious Action of honour in
Armes these Knights were sworne to obserue: which for breuitie I omit.
Neuerthelesse (being vsed to lose my labour) I aduenture to say this
little: and the rather, because this order of knighthood is ancient and
English.
                  I doe not read of any robe or habit prescribed vnto these Knights, nor
with what ceremonie they were made.
                  Their place of meeting and conuocation was the city of Winchester,
where king Arthur caused a great round Table to be made, and at the same
the Knights at the feast of Pentecost, did sit and eat. The proportion thereof
was such, as no roome could be thought of more dignity then the rest.
Yet (as some writers say) one seat thereof was called, the Sea perilous, reserued
for that Knight that did excell the rest in vertue. That place by consent
of all the Knights was allotted vnto King Arthur, who for his valour
surpassed other professors of Armes.
                  Of officers and ministers belonging vnto this Order, I doe not read, but
of a Register, whose duty was to enter and keepe records of all and euery
action, enterprised, attempted, or performed by any or all these Knights;
which records were read and sung publikely to the eternizing of their honour
and fame.
                  
                     
Whether the number of these Knights were many or fewe, I doe not
find, but it seemeth imparted to a great many, all persons of high dignitie
or much prowesse. For at a city called Carlion, resorted vnto king Arthur at
one time, ten kings and thirteene Earles, besides many Barons and other
Knights of meaner title.
                  As the conquests of this King were many, so was his bounty notable:
for it is written, that vnto his chiefe Seneschal or Steward called Kay, hee
gaue the prouince of Anjou, on his Butler Bedwere he bestowed Normandie,
and to his cousin Berell he granted the Dutchie of Burgundie, and vnto
many other Lords and valiant Knights, he allotted other magnificent
gifts, according to their vertue and merit.
                  Some men haue surmised, that the successe of king Arthurs prosperous
proceeding in his enterprises, was occasioned by counsell of one Merlin,
a man in that time reputed a Prophet.
                  King Arthur hauing all his youth found fortune his friend, was notwithstanding
at length deceiued by the treason of one Mordred his owne cousen,
to whome (during his absence out of England) he had committed the
gouernment.
                  He was also at a city called Augusta encountred of the Romans and Saracens,
conducted by a Consul called Lucius: neuerthelesse Arthur by his
great valour slew Lucius, and forced his Romanes to flee. In that battell also
were slaine fiue Saracen kings.
                  After this victorie, Arthur returned into England, and fought with
Mordred. In which conflict died Gawen a Noble Knight and cousen to
king Arthur. Also in landing, Aquisel king of Scots was slaine; But notwithstanding
the losse of these valiant Knights, king Arthur landed, and
Mordred fledde to London: where the Citizens would not suffer him to
enter the City. Then he went into Cornewall, where Arthur did slea him,
and he himselfe was mortally wounded. So great a slaughter had neuer ben
before that day seene.
                  After this conflict, king Arthur was neuer found aliue, or dead: but (as
some Poets haue supposed) was taken vp into the firmament, and remaineth
there a Starre among the nine Worthies; which fancie is founded
vpon the prophecie of old Merlyn, who many yeeres before affirmed, that
Arthur after a certaine time should resuscitate, and come vnto Carlion to restore
the round Table. There he wrote this Epitaph:
Hic iacet Arturus, rex quondam, rex

                  ¶How enterprises aduenturous ought be admired,
but not discredited.
                  
                     TRue it is, as hath bene formerly said, that many enterprises
in times past attempted and atchieued aboue the expectation
of men, are now thought rather fabulous then faithfully
reported: either because we that now liue did not know,
or see them, or that ignorant men cannot conceiue howe
they might be done, or that want of courage doth disable them to take the
like actions in hand. Yet most certaine it is, that diuers histories commonly
reputed vaine fables, were at the first begun vpon occasion of matter in
effect true, although some writers afterwards, to shew the excellencie of
their inuention, or make their workes more vendible, haue added many
fancies and fictions which are not indeede worthy to bee beleeued. And
who so shall well consider how difficult a thing it is to write an history of
so great trueth and perfection, as cannot be controlled, will easily excuse
these writers that haue taken in hand matter so farre from our knowledge
and vnderstanding. For like vnto all other men, mooued with loue, hate,
profit, or other priuate passion, they are either willing or ignorantly induced
to encrease or extenuate the actions and merits of those men, of whom
their histories haue discoursed. How soeuer that bee, I verely thinke the
Acts and enterprises of Vlysses, Aeneas, Hector, and other famous captaines
(of whome Poets and profane Writers haue written so many woonders)
were indeed of notable men, and some part of their doings such, as writers
haue made mention. Much lesse doe I doubt, that some egregious acts atchieued
and written in the bookes of Amadis de Gaule, Ariosto, Tasso, King
Arthur of England, and such others doe containe many things, which deserue
not to be discredited. But omitting to meddle with time so long since
past, and with countreys so farre from our Climate, wee will remember
some few Actions which worthy men of our owne Nation or our neighbours
(as that of Hernando Cortez, Pisarro, and others) haue (within our
knowledge) to the eternizing of their fame and honour, perfourmed. The
greater part of which enterprises haue bene atchieued in this present age,
and shall no doubt hereafter (when men are lesse industrious) be thought
rather fabulous, then matters credible.
                  Let vs therefore say no more of matter so long before our dayes, and
begin with actions notable performed by men of our owne Countrey, and
they (for the most part) persons of such qualitie, as were not forced with
distresse, but with desire to aduance the honour of their Countrey. Wee
reade in Authors worthy credit, that at one time twentie thousand Souldiers

of this most noble Iland (then called great Britaine) traueiled from
hence vnto Iudea, and vnder the Emperours Vespasian and Titus, serued at
the siege and sacke of Ierusalem. The like enterprize was long after taken in
hand by King Richard the first, who in his owne person traueiled to recouer
the same Citie from the Saracens. The voyages and marueiles which Sir
Iohn Mandeuile reporteth, are accompted of many men rather fables then
reports of trueth, yet of late yeeres, some Sailers euen of our owne nation,
haue found by experience they ought not to be discredited. Who would
haue thought it possible to passe securely into Syria, Persia, Media, and other
farre countreys in the East and Southeast, vntill M. Anthony Ienkinson, (a
gentleman yet liuing, and worthy beleefe) performed those, and other
right notable Voyages? It is also certaine that Thomas Windhame a gentleman
well borne and worshipfully descended, sailed from thence to Guinea,
and the kingdome of Benin, and since that time Captaine Fenner performed
the same iourney, so farre as the Ilands of Capo verde. All which Voyages
with many other were made by Princes, or persons of reputation, toward
the South and Southeast.
                  The like may be said of Voyages of latter time towards the North, and
Northeast Regions performed by sir Hugh Willowby, M. Ienkinson aforesaid,
M. Christopher Burrow and others.
                  Of voyages towards the West and Southwest countreys, who hath not
heard the Nauigation of sir Iohn Hawkins to Brasill, and the West Indias, of
Roger Bodname gentleman to S. Iohn Vllua in the Bay of Mexico, of sir Francis
Drake to Nombre de Dios, sir Martin Furbisher to Meta incognita, sir Humfrey
Gilbert to the coast of America, sir Richard Greeneuile to Virginia, M. Iohn
Dauis gentleman his discouery 200. leagues beyond sir Martin Furbisher to
the Northwest? I omit to make mention of many Merchants, Nauigators,
and simple Sailers of our land, that haue not onely attempted, but also
performed marueilous actions, to vulgar people and vnskilfull thought
impossible. Yet is it now publiquely knowen that sir Francis Drake, and after
him Thomas Candish esquier, (a yong gentleman scarcely knowne to
Sailers) within the space of two yeeres and three moneths, effected a iourney
about the Globe of the whole earth: an action no doubt, worthy all
admiration, and such as before that time had neuer bene performed.
                  Here might we also insert how the mightie and formidable Armada of
Spaine, was by her Maiesties Nauie (conducted by the Earle of Nottingham)
vanquished Anno 1588. being in forraine Nations thought vnresistable.
And more lately the most noble and resolute assault and sacke of the Citie

                        
                           •
                        . Cales, and other strong places of Spaine was executed by the vertue, and
excellent valour of his said Lordship, and the Earle of Essex, lately high
Marshal of England. To these we may also adde the late, and last, (yet not
the least) victorie gained by the noble Earle of Cumberland, who by his
proper vertue, and at the particular charge of him and his friends, assaulted
and possessed the Isle of S. Iohn de Porto Ricco, a place both by nature and
art reputed impregnable. These and other notable aduentures and victories
were aboue the common opinion of men, attempted, and atchieued

by worthie and excellent Captaines of our countrey: and the chiefe of
them within the raigne of our sacred Soueraigne, by whose counsell and
princely prudence they were begun and ended.

                  Of honourable ornaments due vnto men of
vertuous merit, who were euer after
called Knights.
                  
                     IN ancient Histories it appeareth that the old Romanes did
giue rings of gold vnto men of qualitie, seruing in the war,
whom afterwards they called Equites. Such rings the Senators
vsed also to weare, whereof may be inferred that knighthood
and ensignes of honour were giuen as well for Counsell,
as Militarie merit. Cicero seemeth to say that Captaines generall had
in vse (after euery victory) to make an Oration vnto souldiers, commending
their vertue: and to those men that serued with much valour were giuen
rings of gold.
                  We read likewise in holy Scripture that king Pharaoh in signe of honor
did take a ring from his owne finger, and gaue the same to Ioseph.
                  
                  Some Princes also intending to honour their seruants and souldiers did
bestow vpon them spurres of golde or guilded: in signe they were men of
vertue, and professors of Armes on horsebacke: for spurres are onely proper
to souldiers of that sort, and so it appeareth by the signification of the
latine word Eques, and likewise by the terme Caualiero, ordinarily vsed of
the Spaniards and Italian.
                  In old time (as a token of honour and aduancement) Princes did bestowe
girdles and swordes. And the lawe Ciuill seemeth to note that the
girdle signified administration or dignitie, and whosoeuer did loose that
girdle, should also forfeite all priuiledges which the lawe alloweth vnto
souldiers. A sword was alwayes hanging at the girdle, and the hilts thereof
either of golde or g
                        •
                     lt. Hereof it commeth that Princes in creating a
Knight, doe either gird him with a sword, or with a sword touch him on
the head or shoulder, thereby to signifie that as with the sword he is created
a Knight, so with the sword he ought to defend the Prince and countrey
that did create him, without feare of death or other daunger. Hieramias
with his right hand deliuered a sword vnto Iuda, and in the name of
God made him a Knight, saying, Receiue this sacred sword sent from God,
wherewith thou shalt vanquish the enemies of Israel.
                  
                  It hath bene also a custome ancient, that Princes did giue collars as a
singular demontration of fauour and honour.
                  
                     Plinie reporteth that the Romanes did giue vnto their confederates a
collar of gold, and to their owne citizens a collar of siluer.
                  When Manlius in single combat had slaine a French man, hee tooke

from him a collar of golde, all bloodie, and put the same about his owne
necke in token of victorie. After which time, he was surnamed Torquatus,
because Torques in the Latine signifieth a collar or chaine.
                  The Emperours in like maner bestowed collars vpon Captaines and others
that serued in the warre, and deserued commendation.
                  In some Histories may be found, that collars were of two sorts: the first
called Duplares, th'other Simplices. And with those collars the Emperours
(for the most part) did giue prouision of money or vittaile: to some more,
to some lesse.
                  For these reasons and by these examples it appeareth, that among the
ensignes and ornaments of Honor and Armes, the great Collar is of highest
reputation.
                  It is also seene that Princes soueraigne, doe at this day bestow chaines or
small collars vpon men of vertue or fauour, and in token thereof (for the
most part) a picture or modele of the giuer is thereat pendant; which Collat
the Knight or Gentleman that receiueth it, ought carefully to keepe
during his life.
                  The ancient custome was, that Knights of meane degree, and such as
were not of the great Orders (whereunto particular habits are assigned)
should in signe of honour weare a garment of scarlet, because red representeth
fire, the most noble element, and (next vnto the Sunne) of most
brightnesse. It was therefore among the olde Romanes decreed, That no
man should weare any habit of that colour, but only Magistrates and men
of dignity. Red doeth also betoken boldnesse, magnanimitie, and ardent
loue with charitie. The element of fire is also assigned to Mars, in respect
whereof that colour is most proper to Knights, Captaines, and all other
professours of Armes.

                  Knights of the Garter.
                  
                     
                        EDward the third King of England, after hee
had obtained many great victories of Iohn
the French King, and Iames King of Scotland,
both prisoners in the Realme at one time,
Henry King of Castile the Bastard expulsed,
and Don Pedro restored by the Prince of
Wales, did first erect this order in his kingdome
Anno 1350. vpon no waightie occasion,
as is reported. Notwithstanding the
same is, and long hath bene in so great
reputation, as Emperors, Kings and Princes,
haue and doe desire to bee companions
thereof for their greater honour.
                  The patron of this Order is S. George, vnto whom it was first dedicated.
                  The Soueraigne of this Order is the King of England, his heires and
successors for euer.
                  The number of this Colledge of fellowship is 26. Knights with the Soueraigne,
and when any of them die, another is chosen by consent of those
Knights that liue.
                  The habit of these Knights is an vnder garment, or gowne of Crimsin
veluet, of some called ak
                        •
                     rtle, ouer which he weareth a mantle of Purple
veluet lined with white sarsnet, on the left shoulder thereof is embroidred
in a Garter an Eschuchion of S George, and ouer his right shoulder hangeth
his hood of Crimson veluet lined with white, the Cordons to the mantle
are purple silke and gold.
                  Aboue all which, about his necke he weareth the collar of the order, being
of pure gold, made of garters and knots, and enamiled with roses white
and red, weying 30. ounces of Troy weight, with the image of S. George,
richly garnished with precious stones, pendant thereat.
                  About his left legge he weareth buckled a garter enriched with gold,
pearle and stones, whereupon these French words are embrodered, HONY
SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE. Which may be thus Englished, Shame
be to him that euill thinketh.
                  
                  The custome was long that these Knights did yeerely hold a feast at the
Castle Windesor, where the same King Edward founded a Church, and
gaue vnto certaine Priests and Prebends large stipends to serue there. And
he ordained also that thirteene poore aged and decayed Gentlemen by the

name of poore Knights were there for euer to be maintained and kept, inuested
in gownes and mantles of cloth onely, sutable with those of the Order,
to pray for the prosperity of the Soueraigne and his successors, and all
other Knights of the said noble Order.
                  It is not publiquely knowen what mooued the King to make this order:
but thus it is vulgarly reported, that King Edward dauncing with the
Queene and other Ladies of his Court, hapned to take vp a blewe garter
which fell from one of them, and of some said from the Countesse of Salisburie
(of whom the King was then enamored) which garter the King afterwards
wore about his left legge for a fauour. The Queene taking some
offence thereat, it was signified vnto the King by some of the Lords the
cause of her displeasure, at which he smiling sayd, HONY SOIT QVI
MAL Y PENSE. I will make of it yet it be long the most honourable
Garter that euer was worne, and thereupon instituted the order of the
Garter.
                  Some rather thinke it was made to remunerate those Noble men and
Knights, that had best endeuoured and deserued in his most Royall and
Martiall affaires of France, Scotland and Spaine, with all which Nations he
then had warre and triumphed.

                  Of Knights Bannerets.
                  
                     OTher degrees of Knighthood there are in England: but because
they we are no garment, badge or signe to distinguish
them from other gentlemen, they are not knowen to strangers,
yet among our selues we know them right wel, because
euery one hauing such dignitie, is called Sir: As Sir Thomas,
Sir Iohn, Sir William, Sir Simon, &c. But first of Knights Bannerets.
                  
                  A Knight that is to receiue this honour, shalbe led betweene two other
Knights before the King or Generall, bearing his Pennon of Armes in his
owne hand: and in presence of all the Nobilitie and other Captaines, the
Heraulds shal say vnto the King or his Generall these words folowing, viz.
                  May it please your grace to vnderstand, that this gentleman hath shewed
himselfe valiant in the field: and for so doing, deserueth to be aduanced
vnto the degree of a Knight Banneret, as worthy from hencefoorth to beare
a Banner in the warre.
                  Then the King or Generall shal cause the points of his Pennon or Guydon
to be rent off. And the new Knight shal goe vnto his tent, conducted betweene
two other Knights, the trumpets sounding all the way before him,
there to receiue sees: viz. to the Heraulds three pound sixe shillings and
viij pence. And if he were before a Knight Bachelour, then is he to pay also
vnto the Trumpets twenty shillings. I suppose the Scots doe call a Knight
of this creation a Bannerent, for hauing his Bannerrent.
                  Here is to be noted, that no Knight Banneret can be made, but in the
warre, and the king present: or when his Standerd royall is displayed in
the field.
                  A Banneret thus made, and euery estate aboue him, may beare his Banner
displayed, if he be a Captaine: and set his Armes therein as Barons do.
               
               
                  CHAP. II.
                  Knights of the Bath, according to the
ancient vse.
                  
                     WHen an Esquier commeth to the Court to receiue this Order
of Knighthood, in time of peace, according to the custome
of England, he shall be very nobly receiued by the
officers of the Court, as the Steward of Chamberlane, if
they be present, or otherwise by the Marshals and Vshers,
and there shall be ordayned two Esquiers of honour, wise, and well learned

in courtesie and nurture, as also in feates of Chiualry: and they shall be
Esquiers and Gouernours of all which pertaineth to him, who receiueth
the order abouesaid: and if the Esquier doe come before dinner, hee shall
serue the King of water, or with a dish at the first course onely, and then
the Esquiers gouernours shall leade the Esquier that is to be Knighted, into
his chamber without any more adoe, at that time, and towards euening
the Esquiers gouernours shall send for a Barber, and hee shall prepare a
Bath, decked with linnen, aswell within the Tubbe, as without, and that
the tubbe be well couered with carpets and mantels for the colde of the
night, and then the beard of the Esquier shalbe shauen, and his haire rounded.
This done, the Esquiers gouernours shall goe to the King and say, Sir
it is euening, and the Esquier is readie at the Bathe, when it shall please ye.
Whereupon the King shal command his Chamberlaine to conuey to the
chamber of the Esquier the most gentle and wisest Knights that are then
present, to enforme, counsell, and instruct him in the order and feates of
Chiualrie, and likewise that the other Esquiers of that house with minstrelsie
doe goe before the Knights, singing, playing, and dancing to the chamber
doore of the said Esquier.
                  And when the Esquiers gouernours doe heare the noyse of Musicke,
they shall vncloth the Esquier, and put him naked into the Bath. But at the
entring of the chamber the Esquiers gouernours shall cause the musicke to
cease, and the Esquiers also for a time. This done the Knights shall enter
into the chamber still without making any noyse, and then the Knights
shall doe reuerence one to the other, who shall be the first to counsell the
Esquier in Order of the Bath, and when they are agreed, then the first shal
go to the Bath, and kneeling downe before the tubbe shal say secretly, Sir,
great honour may this Bath be vnto you, and then he sheweth him the maner
of the Order that best he can, and then putteth some of the water of the
Bath vpon the shoulder of the Esquier, and taketh leaue, and the Esquiers
gouernours shall attend on each side of the Bath themselues, and after that
same maner shall all the other Knights do, one after another, till they haue
all done, and then the Knights depart out of the chamber for a season. This
done, the Esquiers gouernours doe take the Esquier out of the Bath, & lay
him in his bed, till he be dry, which bed ought to be simple without curtens,
and being dry, he shal rise out of his bed and apparelled somewhat warme
because of the coldnes of the night, and ouer all his apparell he shal weare
a coat of Russet cloth with long sleeues, after the manner of an Hermit,
with an hood. The Esquier being out of the Bath and made readie, the
Barber shall take away the Bath, and all that is about the same, aswell within
as without, and take them for his fees, and likewise the Coller if hee
be an Earle, Baron, Banneret or Bachelor Knight, according to the custome
of the Court. This done, the Esquiers gouernours shall open the
chamber doore, and let the Knights enter in, to leade the Esquier to the
Chappell. And when they are entred, the Esquiers singing and dauncing
shall be brought before the Esquier with their melodie to the Chappell.
And when they are entred into Chappell, then spices and wine shall
be giuen to the sayd Knights and Esquiers. And the Esquiers gouernours

shall lead the Knights before the Esquier to take their leaues. And he shall
thanke them altogether for their trauell, honor and courtesies. And so they
depart: after whom the Esquiers gournours shall shut the doore, and let
no man tarie in the Chappell, except the Esquiers his gouernours, the
Priests, Chandler, and Watch. And so he shall remaine in the Chappell
till it be almost day, alwayes in prayer, desiring God to blesse and increase
his grace in him, to giue him power and comfort to take this high temporall
d
                        •
                     gnitie, to the honour and prayse of him, the holy Church, and order
of Knighthood. And when day appeareth they shal cause the Priest to say
prayers, and communicate if he will. And from the entring of the Chappell
doore hee shall haue a candle of waxe borne before him. Prayers
being begunne, one of the Gouernours shall holde the candle before the
Esquier till the reading of the Gospell, and then the Esquier shall hold it
himselfe till the Gospel be ended, and then it shall be set before him till all
the Seruice be ended. Then one of the gouernours shall take away the
hood from the Esquier. And when the Gospel is read, the Esquier shall
kneele downe and offer money in the honour of God, and him that shall
make him Knight. Then the Esquiers gouernours shall leade him into his
chamber, and lay him in his bed till it be farre day. And whilest hee resteth
in his bed he shalbe couered; that is to say, with a couerlet of gold, called
Sigleton, and the same shall be lined with Kersie. And when it seemeth
good to the Gouernours, they shall goe to the King and say vnto him: Sir,
when it pleaseth your Grace our Master shall rise. And then the King shall
commaund the Knights, Esquiers, and Minstrels, to goe to the chamber to
cause him rise, and to make him ready, and to bring him before him in his
Hall. But before their entring and noise of musicke heard, the Esquiers shall
make all things ready for the apparelling of him. One Knight shall giue
him his shirt, another his hose, the third his dublet, another shall apparell
him in a kertle of red Tartar. Two other shall lift him out of his bed: two
others shall put on his blacke netherstockes soled with leather: two other
to lace his Manches: another to girde him with a girdle of white leather
without any studs: another shall combe his head: another shall put on his
coife: another shall giue him a Mantle of silke, and Kertle of red Tartar,
laced with a white silke lace. But the Chandler shall haue for his fees all the
garments and others wherewith he was clothed at the first entrie, and also
the bed and Sigleton; for which fees, the Chandler of his owne expences
shall finde the coife, gloues, girdle, & lace. Then the Knights shall mount
on horsebacke, and conduct him to the Hall, the musicke playing before
him, his horse sadled with blacke leather, the Arson white, stirrop leathers
blacke, and stirrops gilt, the pectorel of blacke leather with a crosse paty of
gold, hanging before the horse feete, and without a crouper: the bridle of
blacke leather with a crosse paty on the forehead: and then a yong Esquier
to ride before him without a hood, who shall beare his sword by the point
with the spurres hanging at the hilts, which are white, studded with blacke,
and a white leather girdle without any studdes. When they come to the
Kings Hall, the Gouernours and Marshals shalbe ready to meete him, and
at his alighting the Marshall shall haue his horse, or else 100. sh. for his

see, he shall be brought to the vppermost table in the Hall, and there tarie
till the Kings comming, the Knights on each side of him: and the young
man holding his sword betweene the two Esquiers. And when the King
commeth into the Hall, and looketh on the Esquier, ready to take the high
Order of temporall dignitie, he shall demand the sword, and the spurres,
and the Chamberlaine shall take the sword and the spurres from the yong
man, and shall shew them to the King, & then the King shall take the right
spurre and shall deliuer it to the most noble Lord, saying, Put this vpon the
Esquiers heele: and he kneeling on that one knee, shall take the Esquier by
the right legge, and put his foote vpon his knee, and make fast the spurre
to his right heele: and the Lord shall make a crosse on the knee of the Esquier,
and kisse him. This done, another Lorde shall come and fasten the
spurre to the left foot in the same manner. And then the King of his great
curtesie shall take the sword, and gird it about the Esquier: and then the
Esquier shall lift vp his Armes on high, holding the Gantlets in his hands
betweene his fingers and the thumbes. And the King shall put his arme
about the Esquiers necke, and lift his right hand vp, and smite the Esquier
on the shoulder, saying, Be a good Knight, and then kisseth him. And then
the Knights doe leade the new Knight to the Chappell with great melody
to the high Altar, where he kneeleth downe and putteth his right hand vpon
the Altar, promising to defend the right of holy Church during his
life. And then he shall vngird the sword, and with great deuotion pray vnto
Almightie God that he may keepe the Order which he hath taken vpon
him, and accomplish the same to the end, and taketh a drop of wine. And at
his going out of the Chappell, the Kings master Cooke is ready to take away
the spurres, and to haue them for his see, saying, I am come from the
King being his master Cooke, to take the spurres from you, and to shewe
you, that if you doe any thing against the order of Chiualrie (which God
forbid) I will cut away the spurres from your heeles. And then the Knights
shall lead him backe into the Hall, and he beginneth the table of Knights,
and the Knights shall sit about him, and he shalbe serued as the other are,
but he shall neither eate nor drinke nor mooue, or looke here or there, no
more then one that is new married. This done, one of the gouernors shall
haue a handkerchife in his hand, which he shall hold before his face, when
he wil spit or such like: and when the King is risen from the table, and gone
into his chamber, then the new Knight shall be led with a great number of
Knights and Minstrels before him to his chamber, and at their entring
the Knights and Minstrels shall take leaue, and hee shall goe to dinner.
The Knights beeing departed, the chamber shall be shut, and that newe
Knight shalbe dispoiled of all his abillaments which shall be giuen to the
Knights & Heralds, if they be present, or els to the Minstrels, with a marke
in siluer if he be a Bacheler Knight, and if hee be a Baron, then double somuch,
if hee be an Earle or higher estate alwayes doubled, and the Russet
night-cap shall be giuen to the watch, or els a noble in money. And then
he shalbe apparelled in a blew gowne, with the Manches open in the maner
of a Priest, and hee shall haue at his left shoulder a lace of white silke
hanging, which he shall weare vppermost on his garment, so long till hee

haue gained honour in Armes: and be recorded by some noble Knights,
Esquiers, and Heralds of Armes for some memorable deeds done by him,
as hath bene said before, or by some noble Prince, or noble Lady, which
may cut away the lace from the Knights shoulder, saying, Sir, wee haue
heard much of your renowne, and what you haue done in diuers places to
the great honor of Chiualrie, for your selfe and him that made you Knight:
therefore reason would that this lace should be taken frō you. But after dinner
the Knights and gentlemen doe come after the Knight, and doe bring
him to the Kings presence, and the Esquiers gouernours before him. And
when the newe Knight commeth into the Kings presence, he shall kneele
downe before him, saying, Most noble and renowned Sir, I do thanke you
for al the honors, courtesies and goodnesse which you haue done vnto me.
And so he taketh leaue of the King. And then the Esquiers gouernours do
take leaue of their Master, saying, Sir, we haue accomplished the cōmandement
of the Kings as he charged vs, to the vttermost of our power, wherein
if we haue displeased you, through negligence, or deed, during the time, we
desire pardon. On the other side, Sir, according to the custome of the
Court and ancient Kings: we demaund Robes and fees for terme of life,
as Esquiers of the King, and companions vnto Bachelors Knights, and
other Lords.
               
               
                  CHAP. 12.
                  Knights Bachelors.
                  
                     FIrst it is to be remembred, that no man is brone a
Knight of any title, but made, either before a battell,
to encourage them to aduenture their liues, or after
the fight, as an aduancement for their valour then
shewed: or out of warre for some notable seruice
done, or some good hope of vertues that do appeare
in them.
                  These Knights are made either by the King himselfe,
or by his commission and royal authority giuen for that purpose,
or by his Lieutenant in the warres, who hath his royal and absolute power
for that time. And this order may bee resembled to that which the Romanes,
called Equites Romanos, differing in a sort, but in some other sort
doeth agree with it: for seldome in all points one Common wealth doeth
agree with another, nor long any State accordeth with it selfe. Equites Romani
were chosen ex Censu, which is according to their substance and riches;
Euen so be Knights in England for the most part, according to the
yeerely reuenue of their lands, being able to maintaine that estate: Yet all
they that had Equestrem Censum were not in Rome Equites: no more are all

Knights in England that may dispend a Knights land, or fee, but they onely
to whom it pleaseth the King to giue that honour. In Rome the number
of Equites was vncertaine, and so it is of Knights in England, at the pleasure
of the Prince. Equites Romani had Equum Publicum, but the Knights of
England finde horses themselues, both in peace and warre: Census Equester
among the Romanes was at diuers times of diuers value, but in England,
whosoeuer may dispend of his free lands fourty pounds starling of yeerely
reuenue, by an old Law, either at the Coronation of the King, or mariage
of his daughter, or at the dubbing of the Prince, Knight, or some such great
occasion, may be by the King compelled to take that order and honour, or
to pay a fine: which many rich men, not so desirous of honor, as of riches,
had rather disburse. Some also, who for good respect are not thought
worthy that title, and yet haue abilitie, neither be made Knights though
they would, and yet pay the fine of fourtie pounds sterling, which (as siluer
is now prised) is 120. pound currant money. Where of this word Knight
is deriued, or whether it signifieth no more then Miles doeth in Latine,
which is Souldier, I know not. Some hold opinion that the word Souldier
doeth betoken a waged or hired man to fight. Caesar in his Commentaries
called Souldiers, men deuoted and sworne by band or oath to serue the
Captaine, which order if the Almanes did follow, it may be, that they
who were not hired, but being of the Nation vpon their owne charges,
and for their aduancement, and by such common oath and band that did
follow the warre, were (perhaps) called Knights, or Milites: and now among
the Almanes some are called Launce-Knights, as Souldiers not hired,
although they be wel-neere all hired. Or it may be that they who were
next about the Prince, as his Guard and seruants, picked, and chose men
out of the rest, being called in the Almane tongue Knighten, which is as
much to say as dayly seruants, being found of good seruice, the word afterwards
was taken as an honour, for one that professeth Armes. Now our
language is so altered, that hard it were to giue iudgement thereof▪ But
sure it is, we in our English doe call him Knight, whom the French do call
Cheualier, and the Latine Equitem, for Equestris ordinis. Touching the making
of these English Knights, the maner is this. Hee that is to be made
Knight, is stricken by the Prince with a sword drawen vpon his backe, or
shoulder: the Prince saying Soys Cheualier, and in times past, was added, S.
George. And when the Knight riseth, the Prince saith, Auance. This is
the maner of dubbing Knights at this present: and that terme dubbing was
the old terme in this point, and not creating. These sorts of Knights are by
the Heralds called Knights Bachelers.

                  The Ceremonies in the degradation of
Knights in England.
                  
                     IT seemeth that the degradation of Knights hath bene
vsed onely for offences of greatest reproch and dishonour:
which I conceiue partly by the rarenesse of
such actions, and partly for that the men bereft of
that dignitie, were not onely degraded, but also by
law executed. As in the raigne of King Edward the
fourth it appeared a Knight was degraded in this sort.
                  First, after the publication of his offence, his gilt
spurres were beaten from his heeles, then his sword taken from him and
broken: That being done, euery peece of his armour was bruised, beaten
and cast aside. After all which disgraces, he was beheaded.
                  In like maner: Andrew of Herklay a Knight and Erle of Carlile, was in this
sort disgraded. He being apprehended, was by the Kings commandement
brought before sir Anthony Lucie, anno 1322. apparelled in all the robes of
his estate, as an Earle and a Knight, and so led vnto the place of iudgement.
Being thither come, Sir Anthony Lucie saide vnto him these words: First
thou shalt loose the order of Knighthood, by which thou hadst all thine
honour: and further all worship vpon thy bodie be brought to nought.
Those words pronounced, Sir Anthony Lucie commanded a knaue to hew
the Knights spurs from his heeles, & after caused his sword to be broken ouer
his head. That done, he was dispoiled of his furred Tabord, of his hood,
of his furred coats, and of his gird
                        •
                     e. Then Sir Anthony said vnto him these
words, Andrew, now art thou no Knight, but a knaue, and for thy treason
the King doth will thou shalt be hanged.

                  Knights of the Toizon D'or, or
golden Fleece.
                  
                     THE Knighthood of the Toizon was instituted
by Philip (surnamed the good) Duke of
Burgundy, and Earle of Flanders in the yeere
of our Lord, 1429. being mooued thereunto
with deuoute zeale that he had to vndertake
the conquest of the holy land, albeit his
valerous determination tooke none effect, by
reason of many alterations and losses which
hapned vnto the Christians in the East at
that time. Hee elected for Patron of this
Order, the Apostle S. Andrew.
                  
                  The Soueraigne of this Order is he vnto whom the Dukedome of Burgundie
doth lawfully descend.
                  The number of these Knights first elected were foure and twenty, besides
the Soueraigne, all men of Noble blood without reproch, and of
vertuous merit.
                  The habit is an vnder garment of Crimson veluet, with a mantle of the
same, lined with white, it openeth on the right side, and in the wearing is
turned vp on the left shoulder, it is richly embrodered round about with a
border of flames, fusils and fleeces. The hood of crimson veluet the Knights
we are on their heads as by the figure appeareth.
                  The Collar of this Order, is of gold wrought of flames and fusils with
the Toizon hanging thereat. The Soueraigne hath authoritie in himselfe
absolutely to giue, and bestow the same at this pleasure. This Collar, or the
Toizon, euery Knight is bound to weare dayly, or failing, shall incurre a
penaltie. But in time of warre, or vrgent affaires, to weare the Toizon only
shall suffise. Or if by mishap the Collar doe breake, it is permitted for
mending thereof, it may be carried vnto a goldsmith. Or if any Knight
trauelling by the way shall feare to be robbed, he may lay the Collar aside.
Yet it is not lawfull to increase the quantitie of the Collar, nor adde thereunto
any stones, or workemanship, and most vnlawfull it is to sell it, or
change it.
                  Whosoeuer entreth into this Order, mustrenounce all other Orders of
Knighthood, of euery Prince, Company or Religion; yet out of that law
are excepted all Emperours, Kings and Dukes, vnto whom it is dispensed

that they may weare the Ensignes of this Order, if they be chiefe and Soueraignes
of their owne Order. Yet to the end the trueth may appeare, a
Councell of Knights shall be called to consent vnto that dispensation.
                  These with other Statutes and Ordinances the Knights of this great Order
are sworne to obserue and keepe. And many of them haue bene, since
the first institution, enlarged, altered, ortaken away by the Soueraignes.
                  The day of assembly for these Knights, was at the beginning appointed
on the feast day of S. Andrew, but since altered vnto the second of May,
and that but once in three yeres; vnlesse it pleaseth the Soueraigne otherwise
to command.
                  To this Order doe belong foure principall officers, Viz. A Chancellor,
a Treasurer, a Register, and a king of Armes named Toizon D'or.
                  
                  To this Order also appertaineth an Impreze: the inuenter thereof was
Charles Duke of Burgundie: whose high valour brought Lewys the xj. king
of Fraunce vnto great trouble, as Monsieur d' Argenton writeth.
                  The said Impreze or deuice was an Instrument made to strike fire, called
an Ansill, with these words, Antè ferit, quam flamma micet: meaning, he had
power to kindle great trouble before it were perceiued, yet was the euent
vnhappy: for in the warre against Lorayne and the Suysses, after the defeare
of Morat and Granson, his forces were vtterly ouerthrowen, and his person
slaine before Nancy, the Euen of the Epiphany. Whereupon Renato Duke
of Lorayne being victorious, and seeing the standerd of Duke Charles with
the Impreze of the Instrument of fire, sayd, That vnfortunate Prince when
he had most neede to warme him, lacked leisure to strike fire: which speech
was pithie; and the more, because the earth was then couered with snow,
and by reason of the conflict, full of blood. At that time was the greatest
frost and cold that any man liuing could remember.
                  The Toizon which these Knights doe weare hanging at their Collar of
Order, is the forme of a golden fleece, which Iason woon at Colchos: others
do suppose it to be the fleece of Gedeon, whereof the holy Scripture maketh
mention; which signifieth Fidel
                           •
                        ie, or Iustice vncorrupted.
                  
                  The number of these Knights was much encreased by the Emperour
Charles the fifth; who hauing the dukedome of Burgundie, elected into that
Order persons of greater Title then were at the beginning, and commanded
the election should be by consent. After him, King Philip of Spaine
did the like.

                  Knights of S. Michael.
                  
                     IN the yeere 1469. Lewis the xj. French King
erected an order of Knighthood whereinto
himselfe with others the most principall
Peeres of France did enter. It is said, the occasion
which moued the King to intitle this
Order with the name of S. Michael, was the
memory of an apparition of that Saint vpon
the bridge of Orleance, when that Citie was
besieged by the English, at which time liued
a certaine mayden called Iohan, a woman of
so rare wit and valour in Armes, as was reputed
more then a mortall creature, or rather some enchantresse of singular
knowledge.
                  This Order is ornified with a great Collar, whereat the Image of S. Michael
hangeth. The words thereon set, are these: Immensitremor Oceani.
                  
                  The Soueraigne of this Order is the French King and his successors.
                  The number of Knights to be elected into this Order is 36. But of late
yeeres that number hath bene much encreased, and thereby the order become
of small reputation: yet it is said, that the great Collar and Robe is
bestowed onely to that number, although the Michael be giuen vnto many.
Howsoeuer that be, sure it is, that th'entent of that King was to make
choise onely of the most noble personages of his owne blood, and others,
who for vertue and honour were accompted worthy: as by the first election
appeareth: who were these.

                     THis Order was also about the same time begun
by Amedeo Count of Sauoy, sirnamed I

The Collar appertaining to this Order
is made of gold, and on it these foure letters
engrauen, F. E. R. T. which signifieth,
Fortitudo eius Rhodum tenuit. At the said Collar
hangeth a Tablet, wherein is the figute of the Annunciation.
                  The Church appointed for ceremonies appertaining vnto this Order, is
called Pietra, within a Castle in the Diocesse of Belleis, whereunto was giuen
(at the foundation of this Order) certaine lands for the sustentation of fifteene
Chapleins.
                  For continuance of this Order, at the time of the constitutio
                        •
                      were
made many honourable ordinances to be kept by the Knights presently
elected, and after to be elected. The chiefe of them are these following.
                  First, that he the said Duke and his successour should be Lord and Soueraigne
of the said Order.
                  That euery brother and companion of the said Order should at all occasions

his person & estate against euery other person or persons whatsoeuer.
                  That if any question or controuersie should arise betweene two Knights,
then they to submit the ordering thereof vnto two or more of the fraternitie,
and after to obserue the same vnuiolated.
                  That for auoiding of suite in Lawe, whensoeuer any cause of Action
was betweene the Knights, then the censuring thereof should be referred
vnto foure other companions of the Order, to the end the matter might
be determined without charge or expences. And if the question depending
were difficult, then the Knights that were to consult there of might call
vnto their assistance, two Doctors, m
                        •
                     n of approoued honestie and vnderstanding.
                  That euery Knight at his death should giue towards the maintaining

That at the death of euery Knight the rest of the companions should assemble
at the Castle of Pietra to bury the dead in good and honourable
order, and euery of the said Knights to weare a white gowne, and so make

speed might be, to come thither after.
                  That euery Knight at his buriall should giue vnto the Church a Collar,
a Banner, his Armour, and coat of Armes, if he be a Banneret; or not being,

                  That euery Knight should at his owne charges come vnto the buriall
accompanied with two seruants, and bring thither foure great waxe Candles
or Torches, weighing one hundreth pounds.
                  
                     ¶After this Order of Knighthood was ordained at the Castle
of Pietra the third of Februarie Anno 1434. by Amadeo
first Duke of Sauoia, these Statutes were added.
                     THat euery Knight after the death of any of the brethren, should (during
certaine dayes) be apparelled in blacke, and not weare the Collar
for nine dayes next after the Knights decease signified.
                     That the Soueraigne should at the buriall offer vp his collar.
                     That euery Knight in going to offer should proceed according to his
ancientie without other respect.

fault should be committed, then presently was forced to forgoe his collar,
and neuer more to weare it, but returne it vnto the Soueragine within two
moneths. And if he failed so to doe, then to abide the censure of his companions,
and by an Herauld be summoned to send the collar vnto the Soueraigne,
and be enioyned neuer after to weare it.
                     That euery Knight should be sworne to weare the Order daily and not

                  Knights of St Esprit.
                  
                     THE Order of St 
                     Esprit, was instituted by the right
Christian King of France, and Poland, Henrie the third
of that name, containing a hundred and fiue Articles.
This Knighthood was instituted in the yeere of grace
1578. and in the fifth yeere of his reigne.
                  It was called the Order of the S. Esprit, for that on
the day, and feast of Pentecost, it pleased God (as
they say) by the inspiration of the holy Ghost, to vnite
the hearts and wils of the Polish Nobilitie, at an assembly of Estates
generall of that puissant kingdome, together with the great Duchie of Lituania,
to make choise of the said Henry for their King, and afterward vpon
the same day, and feast, to call and accept him to the rule and gouernment
of that Crowne.
                  In commemotation whereof with the aduice & consent of the Queene
his mother, the Princes of his blood, and other Princes Officers of his
Crowne, and Lords of his Councell, he instituted this Militarie Order of
S. Esprit to be continued for euer, with all Ordinances and Statut
                        •
                      therein
mentioned irreuocable.
                  The number of persons conteined in the said Order are one hundred,
besides the Souereigne, which is euer the King: in which number are comprehended
foure Cardinals, fiue Prelates, the Chauncelor, Prouost, Master
of the Ceremonies, great Treasurer, and Scribe, who are called Commanders.
So that neuer after for any cause or question whatsoeuer, the
said number should be augmented, nor vpon the vacation happening of
any of the places of the said Cardinals, Prelates, or Officers, any other may
be admitted to supply their roome or seruice, vnlesse he be a man of like
qualitie and condition.
                  The oathes, ceremonies, pensions, accompts, and other dueties I leaue
to be seene in the printed booke of the Order, where they are discoursed of
at large: I onely will set downe the time of their feast, their Officers, the
maner of their habits and solemne proceeding, as most fitting and pertinent
to our purpose.
                  Euery yeere the feast of the Order is celebrated the first day of Ianuary,
in the Church of the Augustines in the citie of Paris. And if for the publique
affaires of the Realme, the king in person can not be there present,
then the feast is to be celebrated, where he shall personally be, and in the
greatest Church, where he is to be assisted with the Cardinals, Prelates,

Commanders, & other officers of the said Order, except any of them haue
commandement by the Soueraigne to the contrary. And as they shall in
number repaire to the Court, they are to aduertise the Prouost of the said
Order, to the end he may prepare their Escuchions in the Church, where
they are to solemnize their Ceremonies, which beginne the Euen of the
said day, and where they all accompany the Souereigne from his Pallace
to the Church, as followeth, viz.
                  The Vsner marcheth formost, the Herauld after the Viher, then the
Prouost, great Treasurer, and Scribe, the Prouost taking his place between
the two others. The Chauncelor goeth alone, the Commanders two and
two after their degrees. After whom proceedeth the Soueraigne, or great
Master, who is followed of Cardinals, Prelats, and other of the Nobilitie,
being of the said Order. The sayd great Master, and Commanders are apparelled
with long Mantels, made after the fashion of those which are
worne the day of S. Michael, of blacke veluet embrodered all about with
gold and siluer, the embroderie made of flowers de Liesse, & knots of gold,
betweene their sundry cyphers, of siluer, and flambes of gold seamed.
                  The said great Mantle is also garnished with a mantelet of greene cloth
of siluer wrought ouer, with the same manner of embrodery of the great
Mantle, and the said Mantle, and mantelet, are both lined with 
                        •
                     atin of
Orenge colour. They weare the said Mantle, turned vp ouer the left side,
and the opening ouer the right, according to the paterne, which is here
expressed, their hose & d

                        •
                      of the
Order, which was giuen them at their reception.

sowed before on his Mantle, and that of golde hanging at his necke by a
blew riband. The Prouost, great Treasurer, and Scribe, haue also Mantles
of blacke veluet, and mantelets of greene cloth of siluer, but they are

                  At their returne from the Vespres, or Euensong, the Commanders and
Officers, goe to confession to be prepared for the Sacrament, which they
are to take the next morning.
                  The next day the Cardinals, Prelats, Commaunders and Officers, accompanie
the Soueraigne, in like Order and Habilement (as aforesaid) to
the Church to heare a solemne Masse, where the Souereigne offereth as
many crownes, as he is veeres old, and euery Commander for himselfe one

                  The seruice ended, they conduct the Soueraigne to his pallace, wheras

the Cardinals, Prelates and Commanders, with the Chancellor of the
Order, dine all at one Table. The Prouost, Treasurer, Scribe, Herauld,

deepe mortey, hauing the crosse of the said Order sowed thereon, goe to
the Church to heare the Euensong.
                  The Herauld of this Order, called King of Armes, at his election making
profession of that Religion, is knowen to be a man of good renowme,
graue, expert, and fit for such a charge. He hath 400. crownes of the sunne
yeerely for his ordinary wages. He is bound to make abooke, in which

Commanders and Officers of the said Order, and vnder their Armes
their names, surnames, signiories, imvlovments, and qualities. And for
the same to be done, euery one of the said Cardinals, Prelates and Commanders,
are enioyned to giue him a marke of siluer at their reception.
When occasion serueth that he is to denounce, or signifie any message to
any of the said Commanders and Officers, he is to report vnto the Soueraigne
in open Chapiter the answere which hath bene made him, and what
els he hath learned in his voyage, concerning the good, honour and seruice
of the said Order.
                  It is to be noted that this Herauld or King of Armes hath nothing to do
with the Order of S. Michael: for there is an expresse Officer for the same:
nor either of them both are to meddle with any action of Armes, but such
as may precisely concerne their Orders. There are for the Kings seruices

                  Knights Templars.
                  
                     IN the yeere 1117. nine Gentlemen who happened
to meete in the Holy land, (of which number was
Godfredus Aldemaro Alexandrino, and Hugo de Planco
de Paganus) among themselues determined to erect
an Association or brotherhood. And being come
vnto Ierusalem, they consulted vpon the estate of
that countrey, beeing enformed, that in Zaffo (a
towne anciently appertaining to the family of Contareni
in Venice) there remained many theeues that vsed daily to rob such
Pilgrims as resorted vnto the holy Sepulchre. They therefore resolued (as
a seruice acceptable to God) to hazard their liues in the suppression of
those robbers, whereby the way vnto Ierusalem might become secure. And
because the Christian armie was then employed in recouery of the Holy
land, no order was taken for safe passage. To encourage these Gentlemen
in so praiseable an enterprise, a lodging in the Temple of Ierusalem neere
vnto the Sepulchre, was appointed; of which place they tooke the name of
Knights Templars. Also the King and Patriarch much liking an action so
honourable, furnished them with many necessarie prouisions. To them
also resorted many other Christians, so as in short time the number became
much encreased: yet no habit, signe, or rule was agreed vpon. Notwithstanding,
the Gentlemen persisted in their vow nine yeeres, and grew
to so great reputation, that Pope Honorius at the suite of Steuen Patriarch
of Ierusalem, prescribed vnto them an order of life, whereby they were enioyned
to weare a white garment; and Pope Eugenius added thereunto a
red Crosse.
                  After which time, they elected an head or great master, like vnto him
that commandeth in Malta. The number of these Knights daily encreased,
and their enterprises became famous: not onely for guarding the way and
passages, but also they vndertooke warre against the Infidels, both by Sea
and land. And the Christian Princes mooued with loue of their vertue, in
sundry prouinces assigned vnto them houses and great reuenues to be spent
in Gods seruice. In processe of time they became so potent, as in euery
Christian kingdome they were owners of Townes, Fortresses, and Castles,
and wheresoeuer the great Master did goe, a mightie army did follow him.
                  It pleased God afterwards to permit, that Ierusalem and other places of
the Holyland, through discord among the Christians, and negligence of
Princes not sending thither any aid, was conquered, about ninety yeeres

                  Knights of San Iago.
                  
                     
                     NExt vnto the Knights aforesaid,
for honour and estimation are
these Knights of S. Iames in Spaine,
by the Spaniards called Caual
                           •
                        eri
di San Iago. The originall of which
Order was this.
                  At such time as the Arabians had well neere
conquered the Countrey, the remainder of the
Spanish people refusing to liue vnder the Lawes
of that barbarous nation, retired themselues vnto
the mountaines of Asturia, and there setled a
gouernment.
                  After some yeeres of their abode there, certaine
gentlemen consulting together, determined
to make an association, and begin a warre vpon the infidels, and Moores.
These gentlemen to the number of thirteene, being all Barons and men of
great qualitie, agreed also vpon certaine religious rules of Knighthood, yet
reseruing vnto themselues libertie of mariage.
                  The Ensigne which they resolued to weare was a red Crosse in forme
of a sword.
                  This Order was erected at such time as the King Don Ramiro wanne the
victory against the Moores in the prouince of Compostella, at which time
great possessions and priuiledges were giuen to S. Iames of Compostella,
Anno 1030.
                  This Order hath one chiefe gouernour, who is called great Master: he
with thirteene other Knights haue authoritie to choose or remooue any
Knight at their discretion.
                  Vpon the feast day of all Saints these Knights do vse to meete, and consult
vpon matters apperteining to their estate.
                  The reuenues belonging to these Knights is marueilous, amounting to
many hundred thousand duckets.
                  Many Popes haue giuen their alowance to this Order, yet either they
could not, or would not reserue a greater tribute thereof then ten Malachini
yeerely.

                  Knights of S. Iohn Ierusalem: called Knights
of the Rhodes: and now of Malta.
                  
                     IT is written (I know not with what warrant)
that at the Citie of Amiens in Picardie, a
Prouince of France, there was borne a certaine
Gentleman, who in his childhood had
bene brought vp in learning: and being
growen to mans estate, disposed himselfe to
the exercise of Armes, and there in long time
continued. Afterwards hauing attained riper
yeres, he despised the world, and framed
himselfe to a solitarie life, as one fully resolued
to liue in contemplation, vnseene of any
but God alone. Hauing sometime remained in that solitarie sort, a suddaine
desire he had to visite the Sepulchre where Christ was buried, which
shortly after he did. And to the end he might with securitie passe the Barbarous
Nations, he apparelled himselfe like vnto a Phisition; by which
meane without impediment he performed his iorney. Thus hauing passed
the difficulties of trauell in diuers strange Countries, he arriued at Ierusalem,
and being there, fell into acquaintance with Simon, Patriarch of that
Citie, and in lamenting wise enformed him of the oppression and crueltie
offered and dayly vsed by the Infidels towardes the poore Christians in
those Countreys. Whereunto Simon answered, that albeit the Christians
in those countreys indured great outrages, yet they of Ierusalem suffered
much greater, and should be forced to more, if God did not defend them.
                  By this conference, the Patriarch conceiued Peter the Hermit (for so he
was called) to be a man of good vnderstanding, and apt to execute any
action of importance, that should be committed vnto him. Whereupon
the Patriarch determined to make him a messenger vnto the Pope, vnto
whom by letters he imparted the great calamitie and afflicted estate of the
poore Christians, inhabiting the Holy land.
                  
                     Peter hauing receiued his instructions, and letter of credence, returned
into the West: first vnto the Pope, and after sollicited other Princes: in
such sort, and with so good successe, as by his perswasions, many great
Kings and Potentates, consented to take in hand the recouery of the Holy
land from the oppression of the Infidels, and some of them furnished that
enterprise with men, some with money, and some did go in person. Among
which number (as the chiefe) was Robert Duke of Normandie, sonne to

King William of England, Godfrey Duke of Lorain, with two of his brethren
called Eustace, and Baldwin, Robert Earle of Flanders, Hugh surnamed the
Great, brother to the French King: with diuers other Princes, Dukes,
Earles and Barons. Also thither went Beaumond Duke of Calabria, who for
zeale to that seruice (or desire of honour) resigned his Dukedome vnto
Ruggiero his brother, taking with him so many of his subiects as would voluntarily
follow him, of whom (with such other Captaines and souldiers
of Italy as came vnto him) hee assembled more then twenty thousand, all
choyse men and young, fit for warre.
                  All things in this sort prepared for the iourney, Vrban the second (then
Pope) sent vnto the Captaines a white Crosse, with commandement that
all the souldiers should weare the like, calling that enterprise La cruciata. It
is sayd that the Christians, as such time as this warre was proclaimed in
Cleirmont (a citie of Auergna) indeuoured themselues vniuersally to animate
the souldiers, and ioyned in generall prayer for their good successe,
giuing them meat, apparel and furniture, vnasked or required. Moreouer,
those that were indebted, were forgiuen, and such as had beene banished,
were pardoned. The women also (contrary to their custome) willingly
and with much ioy consented their husbands and sonnes should passe in
this enterprise, and for their furniture gaue them their Iewels, Chaines,
and money. The French King likewise sent them great treasure, and gaue
priuiledges to the souldiers lands and wiues, in their husbands absence.
And many great Princes, and other Lords sold and impawned their Patrimonies
to further this action. So as the Armie assembled for this holy enterprise,
amounted vnto three hundred thousand footmen, and one hundred
thousand horse, who presently marched towards Constantinople,
where they passed the Strait called Bosphoro Thracio, & landed at Calcedonia.
                  
                  For the first enterprise they besieged Nicea in Bithynia, which within
fiftie dayes was yeelded: and the fouth of Iuly at the foote of certaine
mountaines neere vnto that citie, the Christians fought a battell with a
Turkish Armie, which in number exceeded ours, and thereat was present
Solyman the Emperour of Turkie, but the Christians had victory, with the
losse of two thousand men: of the Enemies were slaine fourtie thousand.
                  This victorie gained, the Christians following their enterprise, within
short time wonne an hundred cities and townes of accompt: and among
them the great Antiochia, before which they begun the siege the twentieth
of October, and tooke it the last of May following, where they found Corbona
King of Persia, and Cassiano, Lord of Antioch. Neere vnto that place in
one other conflict were slaine more then one hundred thousand Turkes,
with the losse of foure thousand of ours.
                  The cause of this victory was (in that time of superstition) imputed to
the vertue of a bloody Lance found in Antiochia, which they supposed to
bee a speare wherewith Christ was wounded on the Crosse. It was also
sayd, that the Turkes did see (or imagine) another great Armie comming
against them from the mountaines, conducted by three Captaines mounted
vpon three white horses, the beholding wherof occasioned their flight.
                  This victory being had, a Nauie arriued from Genoa and from Venice.
                     
Also with them came certaine ships conducted by one Vymer of Bullein in
Picardie, a notable Pirate, who repenting his former like, determined to follow
that honourable Action.
                  The Christian forces thus increased, they marched towards Ierusalem,
and besieged it, & notwithstanding the city was of great force, yet by Gods
helpe, and the valorous aduenture of the Christians, it was assaulted, and in
the end yeelded, Anno 1099.
                  This Citie thus conquered, the sayd Peter (as the chiefe procurer of the
enterprise) was highly honoured, and Godfrey Duke of Lorayn elected King
of the Holy land.
                  But to returne to the Original of these Knights, I say, that somewhat before
the Christians conquered the Citie of Ierusalem, they had obteined of
the Saracens leaue to dwell neere vnto the Sepulchre of Christ, and there
builded an house, calling it the Hospital of Christians, whither all other
Christians dayly resorted. After that, the number of Christians increasing,
they builded another houses for women, calling it S. Mary Magadelens. And
at length they made a third house, calling it S. Iohn Baptists, where for the
keeping of good order they appointed an officer whom they called Rector.
                  
                  Some time after was elected to that fellowship, a gouernour called Gerardus,
who commanded that he, with al others of that house, should weare
a white Crosse vpon a blacke garment, which was the originall of the Order,
and euer since hath bene vsed.
                  Afterwards one other Rector or great Master was elected, whose name
was Raimondus, to whom authority was giuen, that he should gouerne and
command all Knights of this Order, where soeuer they were dispersed.
                  Many yeeres after these Knights conquered the Isle of Rhodes holden by
the Turkes, Anno 1308. which was the cause they were commonly called
Knights: and diuers princes seeing them martially inclined, gaue vnto
them great lands and possessions: and they became greatly esteemed for
their seruice, chiefly against the sayd Turkes, and the Soldan, king of Egypt
and Ierusalem.
                  
                  The sayd Isle of Rhodes (during those Knights inhabited there) was foure
times assaulted, yet by Gods helpe, and the valiancie of the Knights, it was
defended Then Mahomet Otoman Emperour of Turkie, Anno 1480. with an
excessiue force of men, and an hundred Saile of Galleys (conducted by a
Bassa borne in Greece, descended of the rase of Paleologi sometime Emperors
of Constantinople) did besiege it, but after 89 dayes of continuall batterie,
they were forced to abandon the enterprise, and for their farewell, in
the last assault, the Knights slew more then fourtie thousand Turkes.
                  But in the yeare 1523. in the moneth of Ianuarie, the Turkes againe inuaded
the Island, and after three moneths Siege preuailed: for the rest of
Christendome neuer vouchsafed them either aide or reliefe.
                  Since the losse of Rhodes, these Knights haue remained in the Island of
Malta, and often defended it against the enemies of Christendome, but
chiefly in the yeere 1565.
                  The first erector of Statures and Rules for the gouernment of these
Knights, was the sayd Raymondus, calling himselfe, Raimondo di Poggio,

Seruo dipoueri di Christo, e custode dello spidalle di San Giouanni Battista di Ierusalem.
                  
                  No man might be receiued into this Knighthood, vntill he had proued
his gentilitie, in presence of the great Master, and other Knights.
                  Nor no man descended of a Moore, a Iew, or Mahometan, might be admitted,
although he were the sonne of a Prince.
                  And euery Knight of this order was sworne to fight for the Christian
faith, doe Iustice, defend the oppressed, relieue the poore, persecute the
Mahometans, vse vertue, and protect Widowes and Orphanes.
                  Diuers other Articles there be: but for that they are full of superstition, I
omit them.

                  Knights of Calatraua.
                  
                     
                     BY imitation of the Order of S. Iago aforesaide, was this
Knighthood of Calatraua begun in the yeere 
                        〈◊〉
                      30. The inuenter
thereof was Don Santio King of Toledo.
                  
                  They were called Knights of Calatraua, of the prouince
and place where they were made and setled, which was
where anciently the chiefe Church of Templars had bene, who not being
of power sufficient to resist the Saracens, were forced to yeeld the place vnto
these Knights.
                  The habit of these Knights is a blacke garment, and vpon it in the breast
is set a red Crosse.
                  These Knights haue also exceeding great possessions, and many commandries
in diuers places of Spaine.

                  Knights of the Band.
                  
                     THis order was first erected by Alphonso King
of Spaine, sonne to Ferdinando and Queene
Constanza in the yeere 1268. And to giue the
said Knighthood reputation and honour, the
King himselfe with his sonnes and brethren
vouchsafed to enter thereinto: with them
were also admitted diuers other gentlemen
of best quality and greatest estimation.
                  The cause that mooued the King to name
them, Knights of the Band, was, for that hee
commanded euery man elected into the Order,
should weare a certaine red Scarfe, or Lace of silke the bred
                        •
                     th of three
inches, which hung on their left shoulder, & was tied vnder the right arme.
                  No man might enter into this Knighthood, but such as the king did specially
admit: neither was any person capable of that dignitie, vnlesse hee
were the sonne of a Knight or some Gentleman of great account, or at the
least such a one as had serued the King by space of ten yeeres in his Court,
or in the warre against the Moores.
                  Into this Order no Gentleman could be receiued being an elder brother,
or an heire in possession or apparance, but only such as were yonger,
without land and liueload: because the Kings intention was to aduance
the Gentlemen of his Court that had not of their owne.
                  At such time as any Gentleman was admitted a Knight, he promised to
obserue these Articles following, which I haue thought good particularly
to expresse, and the rather because they tend only to entertaine the minds
of men in the offices of Courage and Curtesie, without any mixture of superstition,
whereof almost all other Orders in those dayes tasted.
                  First, that hee should speake vnto the King for commodity of the common-wealth
and the defence thereof, so often as he were thereunto required;
and refusing so to doe, shall for feit all his patrimony, and be banished
his countrey.
                  That he should aboue all things speake the trueth vnto the King, and at
euery occasion be faithfull to his Maiesty.
                  That hee should not be silent whensoeuer any person should speake against
the Kings honor: vpon paine of being banished the Court, and depriued
of his Band for euer.
                  That he should be no great speaker, and in speaking to vtter the trueth:

but if he should say or affirme an vntrueth, then for a punishment, to
in the streets without his sword, for one whole moneth.
                  That he should endeauour himselfe to keepe company with wise m
                        ••
                     
and persons experienced in the warre: for being found to conuerse wi
                        ••
                     
merchants, artificers, or base people, he should be therefore greatly reproued
by the great Master, and for one moneth be commanded to keepe his
house.
                  That he should maintaine his owne word, and faithfully keepe promise
with his friends: and being found to do otherwise, to be enioyned to walke
and goe alone, vnaccompanied of any other of the Kings Court, & should
not presume to speake or come neere vnto any other Knight.
                  That he should alwayes haue good armour in his chamber, good horses
in his stable, good launces in his hall, and a good sword by his side: or
otherwise to be called Page, and no Knight, for one whole moneth.
                  That he should not be seene mounted vpon any Mule, or other vnseemly
hackney: neither walke abroad without his Band, nor enter into the
Kings pallace without his sword, nor eate alone at home, vpon paine to
forfeit for euery such offence, one Marke toward the maintaining of
the Tilt.
                  That he should be no flatterer of the King, or any other person, neither
take delight in skoffing, vpon paine to walke on foote for one moneth, and
be confined to his house another moneth.
                  That he should not complaine of any hurt, nor boast of his owne actes,
nor in curing his wounds crie Oh: for if in vaunting wise hee vttered any
oftentatious speeches, he should be reproued by the great master, and let
alone vnuisited of all his companions.
                  That he should be no common gamester, chiefly at the dice, nor consent
that others should play in his house, vpon paine to forfeite for euery
such offence, one moneths pay, and for one moneth and a halfe not to be
seene in the Court.
                  That he should not in any sort lay to pawne his Armour or weapons,
nor play away his garments, vpon paine to be imprisoned in his owne
house a whole moneth, and for two moneths following, to goe without
the Band.
                  That he should be dayly apparelled in fine cloth, and on Holy dayes in
silke, and on high feastes weare gold in his garments if he pleased, without
being compelled so to do. But if he did weare buskins vpon nether stockes
of cloth, the great Master should take them from him, and giue them in
almes to the poore.
                  That in walking either in Court or Citie, his pace should not be swift
or hastie, vpon paine to be reproued of his fellow Knights, and punished
at the great Masters discretion.
                  That he should not speake any thing vnfit, or offensiue to his fellowe in
Armes, vpon paine to aske him forgiuenesse, and to be banished the Court
for three moneths.
                  That he should not commence or enter suite of Law against the daughter
of any Knight, vpon paine neuer to haue Ladie or Gentlewoman of the

Court to his mistresse or wife.
                  That if he happened to meete with any Ladie or Gentlewoman of the
Court, he should foorthwith alight from his horse, and offer her his seruice,
vpon paine to loose one moneths wages, and the fauour of all Ladies.
                  That if any Lady of honour required seruice at his hand, he refusing to
doe it (hauing power) should be called for euer, the discourteous Knight.
                  That hee should not eate alone, nor at any time feede vpon grosse
meates.
                  That he should not enter quarell with any of his fellow Knights: or if
any such disagreement did happen, that he nor any other Knight should
make partie, but by all good meanes seeke to reconcile them, vpon paine
to pay a marke towards the charge of the next Iusts.
                  That if any man not being of this Order, should presume to weare the
band, that then he should be forced to fight with two Knights: but vanquishing
them, should be also a Knight himselfe: and being vanquished,
should be banished the Court, and neuer to weare the Band.
                  That if at any Iusts or Turnaments in the Court, a Gentleman being not
of the Order, should winne the prize, then the King was bound forthwith
to make him a Knight of the Band.
                  That if any Knight of the Band did offer to drawe his sword against any
of his fellowes: for so doing he should absent himselfe two moneths, & two
other moneths weare but halfe his band. And if a Knight did hurt his fellow
in Armes, he should be imprisoned one halfe yeere, and the next halfe
yeere, be banished the Court.
                  That no Knight for any offence should be punished or iudged before he
were brought to the King, and his pleasure signified.
                  That he should be euer furnished to attend on the King, whensoeuer he
went to the warre: and if any battel were striken, then ought these Knights
ioyntly to giue the charge: and if in any such seruice a Knight performed
not his part, he should loose one yeres pay, and one other yeere weare but
halfe the Band.
                  That no Knight should be inforced to serue in any warre, saue onely against
the Infidels: Or attending on the King to any other warre, to weare
no Band: and if he serued any other Prince in his warre, he should loose
the Band.
                  That all the Knights should assemble three times a yeere to consult vpon
matters pertaining to the Order. The assembly was at such place as the
King pleased to appoint, and there they awaited with their horse and armour;
the first meeting was in April, the second in September, the last at
Christmas.
                  That all the Knights of this Order, should fight at the Turney at the lest
twise euery yeere, Iust foure times a yeere, play at the Canes sixe times a
yeere, and mannage horses euery weeke. And who so failed to performe
all, or any one of these Knightly exercises, should attend on the King one
moneth without a sword, and one other moneth without a Band.
                  That if the King did come to any citie or towne, that then the Knights

within eight dayes after, should prepare a place for the Iusts and Turnaments:
they should also exercise all other warlike weapons: and if any
Knight were negligent in these things, he should be confined to his lodging,
and weare but halfe the Band.
                  That no Knight might remaine in Court without a mistresse, with intent
to marry her, and not dishonour her, and whensoeuer she pleased to
walke, he was to attend on her on foote or horsebacke, to do her all honour
and seruice.
                  That if any Iusts were holden within tenne miles of the Court, euery
Knight to be there, vnder paine to goe without his sword one moneth, and
without his Band another.
                  That if any of these Knights were married within twentie miles of the
Court, all the rest should accompany him to the King to receiue a gift, and
from thence to the place of wedding to exercise feats of Armes there, and
euery Knight to present the bride with some gift.
                  That the first Sunday of euery moneth, all the Knights should shew
themselues armed before the King, ready to performe any action in Armes
at the Kings pleasure: for the King would not haue them be only Knights
in name, but in deed also.
                  That in no Turnament there should be more Knights then thirtie on
one partie, and so many on the other partie, and that no sword should be
brought into the place, but such as were rebated both of edge and point.
And that vpon the sound of trumpet, the fight should begin, and at the
sound of the Clarions, euery man to cease from fight, and retire, vpon paine
that who so failed, should neuer more enter into that combat, and be banished
the Court for one moneth.
                  That at euery day of Iusts, ech Knight should passe foure Carieres, before
foure Knights appointed for Iudges, and they who brake no staues in those
courses, should pay the charges of the Iusts.
                  That if any Knight were sicke and in perill of death, all other his fellow
Knights should visit him, and exhort him to godlinesse. And if he died, to
accompany his course to the graue. Also to mourne in blacke one whole
moneth, and absent themselues from the Exercise of Armes, for the space
of three moneths, vnlesse the King should otherwise command.
                  That within two dayes after such funerall, all the Knights should assemble,
and present the Band of the dead Knight vnto the King, making
humble sute for some of his sonnes to succeed, if any of them were meete,
praying it would please his Maiestie to be good to the mother, that she
might liue according to her honourable calling.

                     THese Knights were erected in the Kingdome of Arragon by King
Iames, who conquered the Islands Maiorica in the yeere 1212.
                  Their garments are white, and thereon a blacke Crosse.
                  The office of these Knights, is to Redeeme Prisoners, whereupon they
are called Caualieri del redentione.

                  ¶The Originall of the Knights Teutonici.
                  
                     
                     THese Knights doe not much varie from the Knights of the
Rhodes, for their custome is to entertaine Pilgrims, and at
occasions to serue in warre.
                  The beginner of this Knighthood' was a certaine Almane,
who after the taking of Ierusalem by the Christians together

with diuers other of that Nation remained there. This Almaine being
exceeding rich and maried, kept a franke and liberall house, relieuing all
passengers and Pilgrims that trauelled to Ierusalem: insomuch that his
house became as an Hospitall or place of ordinary accesse. At length he
builded nere vnto it a faire Church, which (according to the vse of that
time) he did dedicate to our Lady.
                  Not long after many Christians resorting thither, as well for loue of
the Christian Religion, as to visit the sicke, they resolued to erect a fraternitie,
and hauing chosen a great Master to be gouernour, ordained that euery
man of that association, should bee apparelled in white, and vpon
their vppermost garment weare a blacke Crosse, voided with a Crosse
potence.
                  It was also agreed, that no man should be admitted into that order, saue
onely Gentlemen of the Duch nation: and they to protest at all occasions
to aduenture their liues in defence of Christs Gospel.
                  About 88 yeers after Ierusalem had remained in the Christians hands, it
was taken againe from them by the Saracens in the yeere 1184 since which
time it neuer was recouered. For which cause these Knights retired to Ptolemaida,
where they remained.
                  At length Ptolemaida, being also taken by the Saracens, they returned into
Germanie their naturall countrey; where, after some short abode (as loathing
rest and idlenesse) they went vnto Fredericke the second then Emperour
in the yeere 1220, to let his Maiestie vnderstand, that the people of
Prusia vsed incursions vpon the confines of Saxonie, adding that those people
were barbarous idolaters without the knowledge of God, and therefore
besought his Maiesty to grant them leaue to make warre vpon them at
their owne charges, yet with condition that whatsoeuer they gained, his
Maiesty would giue the same to the maintenance of that Order.
                  The Emperour allowing of that suite, presently granted them the countrey,
and vnder his seale confirmed the gift.
                  These Knights by this donation much encouraged, forthwith tooke
Armes, and within short space subdued all that prouince, and then passed
the riuer of Vistola, and conquered other people, who became their subiects,
and were made Christians.
                  Within short space after, these Knights builded diuers Churches, and
among the same Cathedrall Temples, making them places of residence for
Bishops, who were also enioyned to weare the habit of that Order.
                  Neere vnto the riuer Vistola was a great Oke, where these Knights builded
the first Castle and Towne, which with time was encreased and called
Borgo di Santa Maria, or Mareenburg, where is now the chiefe Church
appertaining to this Order: there unto belongeth so great riches and reuenues,
as these Knights may both for men and money compare with diuers
Princes.
                  This countrey of Prussia is great, and much thereof bounded by the riuer
of Vistola: and is also confined by Sarmatia, the Massagets, and Polonia.
                  
                  These Knights are also Lordes of Liuonia, which was likewise by them
brought to the faith of Christianitie, & is with Christians inhabited.

                     THis Knighthood is now extinct, or rather conioyned vnto the
Order of Malta.
                  
                  The Ensigne belonging to these Knights, was two Red Crosses
vnited.

                     IN the life of Pope Vrban the fourth (at which time was great
warre among the Princes of Italy) certaine rich Gentlemen
of Bolognia and Modona, desiring to eschew the present troubles,
and be exempt from publique charges, desired of that
Pope to permit them to liue in contemplation, & erect a new
Order of religious Knighthood, which for money they obtained, calling
themselues Knights of Saint Mary.
                  
                  
                     
The habit of this Order was very pompous, and thereupon a red Crosse
wrought with gold round about.
                  They were specially inhibited to weare gold in their spurres and horse
harnesse.
                  They made profession to fight against the Infidels, and all others that
offended iustice: notwithstanding they liued euer at home in rest, with
their wiues and children.
                  They were commonly called Caualieri di Madona: but because they
liued continually in ease and pleasure, men termed them Fratri gaudenti:
as much in our language, as Good fellow brethren. It may be some of them
are yet extant.

                  Knights of S. Lazaro.
                  
                     
                     THese Knights of this Order doe pleade great antiquity, saying
they were in the time of Sainct Basil, and their profession
hath bene confirmed by sundry Popes. They also affirme
that Fredericke the Emperour surnamed Barbarossa, gaue
them great possessions in Sicilia, Calabria, Pugilia, and Terra
di Lauoro: and to those lands diuers Popes did adde much. Notwithstanding
time that weareth all things away, did also consume these riches, and
the Order well neere extinct, till of late yeeres Pius quartus the Pope did
reuiue it: who made Gianotto Castiglione a Noble gentlemen of Millaine,
great Master.
                  These Knights doe professe to be obedient vnto their great Master, and
other officers of the Order: they promise also to liue chast, or at the least
continent, and content with one wife. Also to be charitable, and liberall,
chiefely to poore people infected with leprosie.
                  Moreouer, euery Knight promiseth to weare a greene Crosse, and before
they enter into this Knighthood must prooue himselfe to be borne in
lawfull wedlocke, and a Gentleman both by father and mother, and to
beare Armes. Also that he is descended of ancient Christians, and no

                     Morrano or Turke. That he hath of rent at the least 200 crownes, wherewith
to maintaine his dignitie. That he and his auncestors haue euer liued
as Gentlemen, without vse of any base or mechanicall occupation. That
he hath not bene suspected of any notable euill fact, or is defamed for any
vice. That he be not indebted, nor is wedded to any widowe, or hath had
more then one wife. But besides these passable protestations, he must vndertake
to say fiue and twentie Pater nosters, and so many Aue Marias, with
other superstitious things not worthy the writing. This Order hath of
late time bene much fauoured by the Dukes of Sauoy.

                     IN the yeere 1561. Cosmo Duke of Florence and Sienna, hauing
setled his gouernment, and liuing in peaceable estate,
erected this religious Order of Knighthood, calling those
that entred thereunto, Caualieri de San Steffano. To these
Knights he gaue a red Crosse, bordered about with gold.
                  The Statutes annexed to this Order, are not vnlike to those appertayning
to the order of Malta: sauing that these haue libertie to marrie.
                  The chiefe place of their resiance is the citie of Pisa, where the Duke
prepared them a Church, and builded for them a pallace wherein to lodge.
And because neere to that Citie is a Hauen fit to receiue the Gallies wherin
these Knights should serue, it seemed good to that Prince to settle
them there.
                  The Duke himselfe and his successors is Great master of this Order, and
vnder him are diuers other Officers of reputation.
                  This is the last Order or degree of Knights, that I haue
seene or read of.

                  The Prooeme.
                  
                     ALbeit, in ages more ancient, Princes
were sometimes pleased to admit priuate
Combate and triall by armes: yet
euen then the lawes determined, that
no man of base calling could be allowed
to fight with any Gentleman, or other
person by long seruice or vertue become
Noble.
                  It behoueth therefore to know what
Nobilitie and Gentilitie is. Be therefore
enformed that Nobilitie is (as some haue defined it) ancient riches
accompanied with vertuous qualities. Others affirme that riches (being
of their owne nature vile) cannot make men Noble; concluding that
vertue alone sufficeth Bartholus sayth, that vertue onely maketh a
man Noble, and riches is an ornament thereof.
                  Others doe thinke, that Nobilitie proceedeth from the ancient honor,
fame and title of Predecessors: because (other wise) a bondman (being
vertuous) might challenge that honour. Some also haue thought, that as
before God he is most Noble and worthy, vnto whom he hath giuen most
grace, euen so is he most Honourable among men, whom Princes or lawes
haue aduanced vnto dignitie. Howsoeuer it be, most sure it is, that no
man giueth vnto himselfe any title, but it behooueth him to receiue it
from others. Therefore Bartholus concludeth that to be made Noble,
it is requisite the Prince should bestow some sort of dignitie, office, or title
vpon the person that is ennobled, to the end he may be knowne from other
men. But our opinion is, that men may be reputed Noble by three
meanes. First by nature or descent of Ancestors, which is the vulgar
opinion. Secondly for vertue onely, which the Philosophers affirme.
Thirdly by mixture of Auncient Noble blood with vertue, which is indeed
the true and most commendable kind of Nobilitie. For seeing man is a
creature reasonable, hee ought be Noble in respect of his owne vertue,

and not the vertue of others, which moued Vlysses to say vnto Aiax,
boasting of Ancestors,
Et genus, & Proauos, & quae non fecimus ipsi,
Vix ea nostra voco. &c.
                  
                  But for manifestation that naturall Nobilitie mixed with vertue, is
most true and perfect, thus may it be prooued. The Almighty hath created
all things, both in generalitie and specialitie, with a certaine excellencie
and bountie, one more perfect then the other, one noble, another ignoble.
For among stones some are precious, others of no vertue, & of the better
sort of them, some more or lesse precious: Euen so among liuing creatures,
both in generality & specialitie, we find some courteous and gentle,
others rude and vnciuill. Much more is the difference of nature in men,
among whom the eternall God hath dispensed his grace, to some more,
and to some lesse, according to his diuine will and pleasure. VVherefore
they seeme to erre much, that thinke Gentility in nature hath no force,
when experience proueth that of one race we see wise, iust, valiant, and
temperate persons. Yet because in ordinarie obseruation we finde, that
neither the horse of excellent courage doth alwayes beget another of like
qualitie, nor that the vertuous man hath euer children resembling himselfe,
we doe not (hauing proofe of their degeneration) esteeme the one or
the other: as Iuuenal sayth,

                        Malo Pater tibi sit Thersites, dummodo tu sis
                        Aeacidae similis, Vulcaniaque arma capessas,
                        Quà m te Thersitae similem producat Achilles.
                     
                  
                  Seeing then that either by nature, nurture, or endeuour, some men
are more vertuous then others, therefore ought they bee reputed more
Gentle, Noble and worthy honour, then are those which are void of noble
Ancestors, good education and industrie. No rule is so generall or certaine,
but sometime receiueth exception. Yet appeareth it, that Nature in
her owne operation doth seldome digresse from the order thereof. The
Faulcon neuer (or very rarely) bringeth forth other bird then a Faulcon.
The Greyhound engendereth a whelpe like vnto himselfe. Neuerthelesse,
if either that bird in shape resembling her Dame, hath not in her
like vertue: or that whelpe doth prooue in delight, diuers from his Sire,
they thereby become either contemned, or little esteemed: Euen so is it
among men descending from Ancestors of honour and vertue: for if
neither by celestiall grace, nurture nor endeuour they aspire vnto the habite
of vertue, then become they thereby vnfit for all publike action, vnprofitable
to themselues, and consequently disdained, or at the least,

lightly regarded, what Pedigree, Armes, or Badges soeuer are to warrant
their Ancient Nobilitie VVherefore estsoones concluding I say with
the Poet,

                        Tota licèt veteres exornent vndique cerae
                        Atria, nobilitas sola est atque vnica virtus.

                  Of particular Combats, with their
Originall.
                  
                     THe Graecians called a priuat fight Monomachia, and the
Law Ciuil Duellum, (as it were) the fight of two persons.
The first vse thereof was among the Mantineians
in Greece: where they that entred into such Combats,
did for the most part appeare in pompous apparell,
with feathers, and other ornaments of great
magnificence. Those fighters also vsed Emblemes
and Emprezes. This kinde of fight seemeth very ancient:
for Homer and Virgil make thereof mention.
               
               
                  
                  CHAP. 2.
                  ¶Whether Combats may iustly be permitted.
                  
                     THe Popes of Rome haue long since inhibited all Combats.
The Lawes Ciuile also doe seeme to reiect that kind of triall.
Yet is it reasonable, that a martiall man iustly challenged,
should (without offence) appeare in the field, and with
sword in hand defend his honour: for by law of Nations it
is lawfull he may so doe. Yet ought he not (without licence) to fight within
his owne Princes dominion, if without losse of reputation he may doe
otherwise. And in the Romane state (without the Magistrates allowance)
the law did absolutely forbid such fight. Therfore as without licence combat
was vnlawfull in Rome, so was it with the Princes permission auowable:
for by such warrant Valerius Coruinus, Marcus Torquatus, and others
did fight.
                  We reade also that Princes themselues, contending for kingdomes, by
that meane (to auoid effusion of blood) haue determined their right: wherof
we haue ancient examples, as the combat of Charles Duke of Anioy and
Peter of Arragon, contending for the Isle of Sicil; of Corbis & Osua brethren,
vpon their title to Carthage; of the Duke of Bohemia and the Duke of Lancaster:
and in holy Scripture, of Dauid and Goliath.
                  
               
               
                  CHAP. 3.
                  ¶When and how Combats were in vse.
                  
                     ALbeit the lawes both Canonicall and Ciuile haue inhibited
Combats, yet by vse and ancient custome (in some countreys)
they were permitted; chiefly among the olde Lombards.
For whensoeur matters of great importance had
beene duely examined, and the trueth could not appeare
otherwise then by Gods iudgement; in such cases the combat was granted:
yet with this caution, that the combatants were first sworne, that without
fraud, and for triall of trueth, the same should be performed.
                  The matters of those combats were chiefly these.
                  If a man were accused of treason.
                  If a reconciled enemy did breake his vowe.
                  If a man for desire of inheritance, were charged to murder his father.
                  If a man were touched with adulterie: or a woman accused to procure
her husbands death.
                  
                     
These and some other doubts, mooued the Lombards to graunt combat,
if by other iust proofes the trueth could not appeare: neither doeth it
seeme barbarous or vnseasonable in those cases, to admit combat. This custome
the Frenchmen also (with little difference) approoued: as it appeareth
by a constitution of King Philip the Faire, yet extant in these wordes:
Siquis occulti criminis capitalis
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         reus sit, atque ita de eo constet, vt quaecstioni subijci
possit, condemnari non possit, is arbitratu accusatoris duello experiatur. Since
those daies combats haue bene more considerately granted in Italy, for the
people of that Nation (being iealous of their honour) vpon light occasions
(and almost for euery lye) would resort vnto a Prince for security and
licence, for combat.
               
               
                  CHAP. 4.
                  ¶What exceptions or repulses may iustly mooue
the Defender to refuse the Combat.
                  
                     AChalenger may be refused in respect of his person, being
knowen a man wicked or infamous. For as it is not reasonable,
that any man of good fame should hazard himselfe
to fight with him that is infamous; so a generall rule it is,
that no man of so vile quality shall beare Armes. Vnlawfull
also it is, and forbidden by law, that any murderer, theese, or other vicious
person should be alowed to accuse or fight with any gentlemā or other person
of reputation Quid sayth, Nulla lex iustior quānecis artifices arte perire sua.
                  
                  Of no better estimation ought he be that is a fugitiue, a seditious person,
a traitor, a forsaker of the Army, a periured man, a traitour to his master or
friend, a bawd, or noted of any crime, that is accompanied with infamie.
               
               
                  CHAP. 5.
                  ¶Whether a man of meane qualitie may
challenge his superiour.
                  
                     FOr answer to this question, I will vse the opinion of Ioannes
Iacobus Triuultius, who beeing Colonell generall of the
French Kings forces, hearing a man at Armes to refuse the
challenge of a foot souldier, said that he ought not, because
euery souldier being enrolled, and in the Kings pay, is reputed
a gentleman: quontam ex militia oritur nobilitas. Euery small disequalitie
ought not make difference chiefly where God is Iudge: before whom

is no difference of persons. Moreouer if that exception were generally admitted,
no challenge should be at all, because none, or very few are equall;
for some are honourable, as they that haue receiued dignitie from the
Prince: other are gentlemen, whose title the Armes of their Ancestors do
warrant. Others for vertuc haue deserued same, and are reputed noble.
Plancus and other ancient writers do say, that Nobilis est, quasi notus. Hardly
therefore are gentlemen found, that by all these meanes can warrant their
Nobilitie. Better it is therefore to iustifie honour by Armes, then incurre
suspition of viletie, or stand vpon curious points of pedegrees. What good
could Plancus haue, when puffed with pride, he boasted himselfe to descend
of the high house of Drusis. And Iuuenal saith:
Nobilitas veraest at
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         vnica virtus.
                  
                  Much doubt hath also bene made, whether a man of meaner title may
challenge a greater: as when an Earle challengeth a Duke, whether lawfully
he may so do. Of this matter diuers men haue thought diuersly. Paris the
doctor saith, That a gentleman borne, and of three descents, may fight or
challenge a Duke vpon any iniurie to him done. The reason thereof is,
That a Duke offering iniurie, maketh him to whom it is offered his equall,
and able to encounter him in Armes, which otherwise he ought not be.
                  But this opinion the Lawiers of later time do not allow. For as in controuersie
criminall, persons illustrious, and of great title, may answere by
Proctor, so may they in combat appeare by Champion.
                  Otherwise it ought be, where both the Challenger and Defender be
Illustri and tituler personages; for in that case, although they are not euen
of one degree, yet being both Noble, the greater Lord cannot refuse to
fight with the inferiour. For which reason an Earle may not be repulsed
by a Marquize, or a Duke, because they are both Right honorable, though
of diuers title. Yet is it not fit, that priuate Gentlemen or Barons should
challenge a great Marquize. A Gentleman of three descents, and such a
one as hath employed his life in Armes, ought not be refused to fight with
men of worship, because the inequalitie of their dignities is not great: and
such is the opinion of Paris.
                  
               
               
                  CHAP. 6.
                  What sortes of men ought not be admitted
to triall of Armes.
                  
                     FOrasmuch as the triall of Armes appertayneth onely to
Gentlemen, and that gentilitie is a degree Honourable, it
were not fit that any persons of meaner condition, should
thereunto be admitted. Wherefore, as the Iudges of ciuill
trials doe ordinarily reiect the testimonie of such as are accounted
infamous, euen so in Martiall triall, a person honourable ought

not by men of base qualitie be accused: for how can hee charge another
with any crime, that hath himselfe committed an offence against his owne
reputation?
                  It hath bene therefore ordeined and determined, that no man hauing
committed treason against his Prince or Countrey, shall be admitted.
                  He also may be repulsed that hath had intelligence or conference with
the enemie of his Prince or Countrey, or that being taken of them, doeth
there remaine, hauing meanes to returne vnto his Princes seruice.
                  He that becommeth a Spie, or explorator for the enemie, or that taketh
an oath against his Prince, or that taketh a Princes pay and departeth before
he hath serued the full time.
                  He that abandoneth the Armie of his Prince, and fleeth vnto the enemie,
or being discharged, doth goe vnto the Enemy in the time of skirmish
or fight, shall be reputed as infamous, and also a Traitour.
                  He that abandoneth the Ensigne of his Prince or Captaine, or that either
by day or night shall maliciously depart from the place of his charge
about his Princes person, or in the campe.
                  Among these we will accompt all theeues, beggars, bawdes, victualers,
persons excommunicate, vsurers, persons banished the Armie, and euery
other man exercising an occupation or trade, vnfit and vnworthie a Gentleman
or Souldier.
                  Finally, whosoeuer is defamed of any notable crime, or is by the law of
the land not admitted to beare witnesse, may be numbred among them
that lawfully are repulsed: these men I say, challenging any Gentleman or
souldier, ought not onely be refused, but of euery honest persons to be abhorred,
because in fighting with men of such condition, a man of good reputation
doth equll himselfe vnto persons vtterly vnworthy. Yet true it
is, that whosoeuer repulseth a person for cause of infamie, must assuredly
know, that he hath bene for such crimes condemned, or at the least the
same is a thing so notorious, as the partie repulsed cannot denie it. But
if any such infamous man be challenged by a Gentleman or souldier, he
may not after be refused, vnlesse that after challenge, he committeth some
infamous fact, which is to be obserued aswell in the challenger as the defender.
               
               
                  CHAP. 7.
                  Who was anciently accounted victorious
in Combat.
                  
                     AT such time as combats were in vse, by permission of Princes,
and publikely performed, the order was thus. If the
Challenger did not vanquish the Defender in the day of
fight, before the Sunne setting; he himselfe was iudged vanquished,
and could not after challenge any other Gentleman.

This victorie, and this priuiledge is onely due vnto the Defender: all
other fauours were common to both the fighters.
                  The next kind of victorie was, when any of the Combattants did yeeld
vnto his enemie, either by confessing himselfe not able to defend, or yeelding
himselfe prisoner, or when he vttered any other speech tending to
submission.
                  The third was, when any of them did expressely denie, or vnsay that he
affirmed, or repent the words whereon the quarrell did grow.
                  Fourthly if he did runne away, and abandoned the lists or field, where
the fight was to be performed. And this was the most base and dishonourable
sort of vanquishment.
                  He was also without victorie and vanquished, that was slaine within the
Lists or sield: yet was that sort of vanquishing least dishonorable, though
by auncient custome no man slaine in publique combats should be buried
among Christian bodies.
               
               
                  CHAP. 8.
                  ¶What was aunciently due vnto such men, as
were victorious in publique Combats.
                  
                     ALbeit I am not ignorant, that this discourse is little or nothing
pertinent to priuate Combat or quarrell; yet for that
it concerneth a matter pleasant vnto vs, and glorious for
those that haue bene victorious, I will briefly set downe
what was due by auncient order of Armes, vnto such Gentlemen
as in publique combat were victorious.
                  Whosoeuer was vanquished within the Lists, was the prisoner of him
that did vanquish. To him also was due all Armes, both offensiue and defensiue,
garments and horse, with all furniture brought thither, either for
ornament or vse.
                  The person of him that was vanquished, was by honourable custome
giuen vnto the Prince of the place, or else vnto some other Prince whom
the vanquisher serued or loued: but this was done by vse, not of dutie.
                  The vanquished also might be compelled to pay the charges of the vanquisher:
                  The vanquished might be forced to pay ransome, no lesse then if he had
bene a prisoner of the warre. But if the prisoner did serue the vanquisher,
the space of fiue yeeres, in seruices meete for a Gentleman, then was he
set at libertie without paiment. And if in the meane time he were emploied
in any base action or seruice vnworthie his degree, then was it lawfull
for him to escape and breake prison: Or if it happened that during the imprisonment,
any land or other wealth did come vnto him, yet was it not
lawfull for the victour to increase the ransome.
                  
                     
If the victor did die within the time that the vanquished was a prisoner,
then should his heire haue the same title and interest.
                  If a prisoner was suffered to goe at libertie vpon his faith, hee did or
ought in any wise returne, being called, vnlesse the victor in the meane
time did become a Traytor to their common Prince, or were excommunicate,
or that betweene them were some new enmitie, for in those cases, it
was lawfull not to returne.
                  If being in this sort at liberty, he hapned to become a Prince, or a Lord,
then was he not bound to returne, but pay ransome onely.
                  If during the time of imprisonment, he were not well vsed, he was likewise
excused: yet did he pay a conuenient ransome.
                  If the prisoner did happen to saue his taker from any great perill, during
the imprisonment, then was he, by law, forthwith set at libertie.
               
               
                  CHAP. 9.
                  Of disequalitie among Gentlemen.
                  
                     OMitting to speake of Emperors, Kings, and Lords of great
title, Let vs onely remember what order was anciently obserued
when one Gentleman or souldier happened to challenge
another.
                  It behooueth therefore to consider, that euery Gentleman
either he hath office, or he hath none. If he hath office, as gouernment
of Countreys, Townes, Ambassage, or commaund in the warre, then his
authoritie or employment doth continue for time, or life. In which case
the custome was anciently thus.
                  If an Officer for time were called to answere by armes, then did hee deferre
the Combat vntill the expiration of that Office.
                  If this Office were for life, and his qualitie superior to the Challenger,
then did he fight by Champion.
                  If the Officer challenged were not superior, then did he aske leaue of
his Souereigne and fight. But if he could not obtaine license, yet did hee
appeare in person, and with armes answere his enemie, for (in those dayes)
the obligation of honour was preferred before all other respects.
                  Whosoeuer was borne Noble (vnder which word is comprised all
sorts of Gentlemen) then were they euer reputed equall. Yet note here,
that a Gentleman borne, is he, who hath his descent from three degrees of
Gentry, both of the mothers and fathers side. So sayth Paris.
                  
                  If the Office or authoritie of the desender were such as ought to command
the Challenger, then might he fight by Champion.
                  A Gentleman of any Noble house (not hauing iurisdiction or commandement)
might in those ages be challenged by any other priuate Gentleman.
And because the profession of armes is honourable, an old souldier

without reproch, was accounted a Gentleman.
                  Ascholler also hauing taken degrees of schoole, was not denied the title
of Gentrie.
                  A simple souldier of honest same, might fight with any Corporall, Sergeant
or other Officer, (the Captaine excepted)
                  Euery Captaine might challenge another Captaine, vnlesse their charges
were such as the one did command the other. And this rule serued
through all degrees of souldiers. Yet men of armes being the most honourable
souldiers, might not be refused to fight with any priuate Captaine of
footmen, being of equall birth and authoritie.

                     A King vncrowned may lawfully challenge a King crowned,
vnlesse the King vncrowned be vnlawfully aspired, or a tyrant.
The number of Christian Kings are 14. of whom only
foure were anciently crowned by the Pope, that is, the
French King, the King of England, the King of Ierusalem, and
the King of Sicil. All the other Kings were crowned by their owne Prelats.
Thus sayth Paris.
                  
                  An Earle being a Prince absolute, and not subiect vnto the Empire, or
any other Potentate, may refuse to fight with any person being a subiect
notwithstanding he hath the title of Prince, Duke or Marquesse. Here is
to be noted, that these titles of honour were at the first giuen in office, as
the title of Duke was proper vnto him that was a Generall of the Armie.
A Marquesse was he vnto whome the confine or marches of a countrey
or kingdome was committed. An Earle or Count was a Iudge or commander
in peace, and of them in the ancient Emperours seruice were diuers, as
the Countes Palatine were as stewards of the Emperors house, of his court,
or stable, and euery of them might challenge any Prince, Duke, or Marquesse
being a subiect, because they are in respect of subiection, reputed
none other then Barons.
                  A Gentleman well borne, and descended from Parentage of foure degrees,
may fight with any Earle or Baton, in case of treason to his Prince
or Countrey, and also murther and infidelitie: because they are (besides
their dignity) none other then Gentlemen, and Gentilitie or Nobilitie is
hereditary and cannot be taken away, but dignitie may. But in other quarrels
of lesse importance, the Earle in respect of his dignitie, may fight by
Champion, but in the cases aforesaid he shall fight in person, vnlesse he be
aged, lame, or otherwise disabled.
                  
                     
A Captaine Generall of an Armie Emperiall or Royall, may not be
challenged by any Gentleman or Lord, neither ought the gouernour of
and City, Towne, or Castle, because no publike commandement may be
abandoned for priuate respect. The like is to be vnderstood of Ambassadors,
who in regard of the place they hold, may (during their commission)
repulse the challenge of any Gentleman or other subiect whatsoeuer.
                  A Souldier basely borne, hauing liued in continuall exercise of Armes
by the space of ten yeeres, without committing any disobedience, or other
reprochfull acte, ought be admitted to fight with any Gentleman borne.
                  A Gentleman, who either by his owne fault or his ancestor, hath committed
any treason against his Prince, may be repulsed to fight with any
other Gentleman, vnlesse the said offender or his ancestors were restored
in blood, or is in descent three degrees frō the ancestor that was attainted.
                  A Gentleman that is knowen Spie for the enemy, or bewrayeth the secrets
of his owne Princes campe, abandoneth his ensigne, or committeth
any other military offence, may be repulsed to fight with euery other gentlemen
of good fame and reputation. And by ancient custome, men blotted
with such a note, might not liue in any City or Towne where the Emperour
or other Prince remained.
                  A Gentleman that hath made profession of Armes, by the space of
twenty yeeres in the Court or Campe of his Prince, without infamy or reproch,
may (not withstanding he be dismissed, re
                        •
                     ired, or cassed) fight with
any other Gentleman that liueth in present pay.
                  A Gentleman hauing aspired vnto any title or dignity, and is either in
respect of age or infirmitie retired to his owne house, ought neuerthelesse
to enioy all his honours, and shall be euer (vnlesse he commit some dishonourable
fact) reputed worthy the honour he receiued in Court or campe,
and fight with any other Gentleman whatsoeuer.
                  An Artificer following the campe, and exercising his Artor Mysterie
(notwithstanding he be also in pay) may be repulsed to fight with any priuate
Souldier that maketh particular profession and exercise of Armes.
                  No man vnder the degree of a Gentleman, ought be receiued or allowed
for a man at Armes on horsebacke: for by the Emperiall lawes the Regiment
of Launces was called Equestris ordo, and they whome we call light
Horsemen, were named Celeri.

                  Of Armes both offensiue and Defensine.
                  
                     IT hath bene before sayd, that by the law of Lombardie, euery
Combat (vnlesse vpon quarell of infidelitie) should bee
tried with shields and staues, and with no other weapon. But
the matter of their Combats was onely for triall of trueth,
without respect of honour. Howsoeuer it were, besides

that custome must be receiued for lawe, it seemeth to me that either in publique
or priuate fight, such weapons ought bee vsed as are commonly
worne of Gentlemen and others professing Armes. And touching Armes
defensiue, it hath beene also the vse, that as they are thought allowable in
warre and all generall fights, so in particular trial of Armes, they ought not
be reiected, because fortitude accompanied with prudence is much the
more commendable, seeing he that vnwisely or inconsiderately aduentureth
himselfe, is not to bee reputed valiant, but furious: neither is hee accompted
valiant, that without counsell or cause, delighteth in dangers,
but he that neuer doth shun any generous action, tending to publique benefit,
or his owne priuate reputation. And Aristotle sayth, that a valiant
man doth neither feare all things, nor dare doe all things. For these respects
it hath euer bene thought fit, that in particular Combats, the Fighters
should be allowed Armes defensiue, and not performe the same naked,
and vtterly disarmed, with swords and daggers onely, as is in this part
of the world now vsed. And sith the perill of life is no lesse in particular
then in publique fight, it seemeth very reasonable that defensiue Armes
should be allowed, yet so as both the challenger and defender be equally
armed and weaponed, which in trueth ought be at the election of the defendant,
as heretofore hath bene discoursed. But because the custome of
the land is, and happily also lawe forbideth that any man should be armed
saue onely in the warre, I thinke no Gentleman ought to refuse to fight
disarmed. And here will I not omit to remember an abuse which hardly is
discontinued, I meane that some English gentleman are so obstinately addicted
to custome, as notwithstanding they doe themselues enter quarrell
and be challengers, yet wil they vse that sort of weapon only which please
themselues. An opinion contrary vnto reason, and the vse of all other people,
as though ancient vse made that weapon onely allowable, which reason
will also prooue vice as good as vertue, because it is no lesse ancient.
               
               
                  CHAP. 12.
                  Of the election of Weapons.
                  
                     FOr good and reasonable causes, many aduantages are due
vnto him that is chalenged, because hee being accused and
constrained to fight, iust and true reason willeth that hee
should enioy all honest fauour. It hath bene therefore well
determined, that whosoeuer is defender, doeth sufficiently
acquite himselfe, and ought be reputed victorious, if hee be not victored.
But on the other side, he that challengeth, must not onely escape to be vanquished,
but also vanquish his enemie: for otherwise he shall be reputed as
victored, and lose the quarell. Which seemeth very reasonable, because his
office is to proue: But the defender is not bound to more then defend.
                  Another fauour also appertaineth to the desender, which is, the election

of the weapon, because, if another man will voluntarily call me to triall of
the sword, the choice of the weapon ought of right to be mine. Yet true it
is, that no defender ought to make election of other Armes either defensiue
or offensiue, then such as are lawfull, and worne ordinarily by gentlemen
and Souldiers. Therewith also is to be obserued, that if the question
whereupon the Combat or fight groweth may be decided by ciuill triall,
that then no trial of Armes ought be enterprised. Much more also may be
added touching the equalitie or disequalitie of the persons that enter into
fight, and likewise of the Armes aswell defensiue as offensiue: but because
publique Combats are now almost generally forbidden, and in this land
most rarely vsed, I speake onely of those things which are to bee knowen
for the performance of priuate Combat and fight betweene particular
gentlemen.
               
               
                  CHAP. 13.
                  Certaine questions, opinions, and iudgements,
vpon accidents happening in trials
and exercise of Armes.
                  
                     IF two men at Armes do couenant to fight on horsebacke,
and runne ten courses with sharpe Launces,
and that hee who worst performeth those courses,
should be iudged victored and prisoner to the other:
It happeneth that at the second course, the one of
them falleth from his horse, and suddenly recouering
to horsebacke offereth to performe the rest of the
courses. The question is, whether it be lawfull for him
so to do, or by the fall be reputed a prisoner? Whereunto is answered, that
in a challenge for life and death, no man ought be accompted vanquished
vnlesse he be slaine, or forced with his owne mouth to yeeld, or deny those
words whereupon the quarell groweth: yet otherwise it is, when the challenge
or Combat is for honour onely, loue of Ladies, or exercise of Armes,
because in that case notwithstanding the Runners be determined vpon a
certaine number of courses, yet if at the first, or after (before those courses
be all performed) any of them do fall, hee that receiueth the fall shall loose
the honour, and the other depart with victory.
                  Two gentlemen being come into the field to fight for life, the one in
fighting happeneth to fall, the other presently sitteth vpon him, and saith,
Yeeld thy selfe; He that lieth vnder, saith like words, and therewith woundeth
his enemie lying vpon him, who feeling his griefe mortal, striketh the
other in the throat. He that was first fallen, ariseth and walketh, shortly after
they both die. The question is, which of them ought to be iudged victorious.
Albeit no dead man can require iudgement of victory, yet to the

of them ought receiue most honour.
                  Hereunto may be sayd, that the hand being a member most necessary
for fight, and placed much higher then the legge: therefore the losse thereof
is of more importance, and consequently dishonourable. On the other
side is alledged, that seeing the legge is of as great necessitie, so as without
it he is disabled to serue either on horse or foote: therfore he who becommeth
hurt and lame in that part, receiueth most dishonour; and the more,
for that no Arte can supply that want, as in the hand it may. But I referre
the true deciding of this doubt vnto the wise and learned reader.
                  Two Gentlemen come to fight for life: the challenger being left handed
is maymed on that hand, the other being right handed looseth it. Which
of them ought receiue most dishonour?
                  It seemeth that in this case the losses and harmes are equall: for he who
was left handed, being maimed on that side, is depriued of that hand which
hee vsed chiefly, and was no lesse apt for him, then the right hand is vnto
the enemie. And sith it is the office of the Challenger not only to maintaine,
but also offend and proue in not doing more to preiudice the defender,
then that harme himselfe receiueth: therfore the chalenger (although
hee looseth but a left hand) is in this case most dishonoured. Yet because
the exercise of these mens hands were of like necessitie, I thinke (vnder
correction) the iudgement ought to rest as indifferent.
                  Two Gentlemen in performing a combat on foot, are hurt in places
equall: the question is, whether of them is victorious.
                  We haue in the former question said, that where two fighters be equally
hurt, the challenger should depart with dishonour, because hee hath not
prooued that which he tooke in hand, which is to vanquish the defender:
therefore the drawing the enemies blood, and the manner thereof is to be
considered. If then the one be hurt on the right arme, and the other on the
left, it may seeme there is none aduantage: for as the right hand is apt to
offend in fight, so the left hand is no lesse fit to defend. Notwithstanding,
for that the vse of the right hand is both more necessary and ordinary, hee
who is hurt thereof, ought to be adiudged vnto most dishonour, chiefly
in combat for life. For in the exercise of Armes for honor only, the iudgement
ought lye dead, or else he shall be thought victorious that most manfully
performed his part, or that regardeth least the wound, or that most
cunningly doth handle his weapon. The qualitie of the hurts is also to be
considered, which of them is more or lesse mortall; likewise which member
is more or lesse to be regarded.
                  Foure Gentlemen determined to fight on horsebacke for triall of trueth
and life, did enter into the Lists: the one partie doe both charge one of the
aduersaries reputed a man of small force, yet valiantly defending himselfe,
did hurt one of the assailers: and his companion seeing the matter so handled,
suddenly dismounteth, and with his Launce woundeth the other of
his enemies in the backe, and forceth the one of them to denie his words:
he that denied, fleeth out of the Lists, perswading his fellow being first hurt
to abide there, saying it was more honourable to die within, then without
the Lists. Hee who forced the enemy to flee, pursued him, but not able to

take him, a question was mooued, which party ought be accounted victorious,
because on either party one was hurt, and the other two went out of
the Lists without licence of the Iudge. Whereto may be said:
                  That he who denied, ought with his companion to loose the honour:
for albeit one of the enemies did also leaue the Lists, yet his intent therein
was to pursue his foe being fled thence: and forsomuch as the combat was
for matter of treason, it sufficeth not onely for the victorious to vanquish
the enemy, but also to bring him into the power of the Iudge to be punished.
And it is plaine, that seeing of the one party one was hurt, and the
other fled, they ought to be iudged to loose all honour, and be condemned
as guilty of that whereupon the quarell was mooued.
                  Seuen Gentlemen doe compound with seuen other, to run certaine
courses at the Tilt for honor and loue of Ladies: in which match, it happened
that fiue of the one partie did commendably acquite themselues, but
the other two of that side were ouerthrowen. On the other side, two only
perfourmed their courses well, and the rest of that company exceeding euill,
losing many Lances, and running very foule: whereof a question grew,
whether vnto fiue well doers, and two euill, or vnto two well doers with
fiue euil, the honour ought to be allotted.
                  Albeit in this case much may be spoken: yet for that the question is not
of any particular mans merit, but which partie in generall performed best
the enterprize, it may be alleaged, that the partie wherein were most weldoers
ought to haue the honour, notwithstanding the fall of two of their
companions: yet for so much as the fall from horsebacke by the enemies
force or vertue is most reprochefull, it seemeth that the misaduenture of
two men onely, may reasonably be the losse of honour to all the rest. And
therefore we leaue the iudgement of this doubt vnto wise men, better experienced
in Armes.
                  Two gentlemen being in combat for life, the Challenger taketh the
sword of the Defender from him, notwithstanding the Defender most valiantly
defendeth himselfe with his arme and hands all the whole day, during
which time he could not be forced either to denie, yeeld, or be slaine.
A question thereupon arose, whether of them was victorious.
                  Forasmuch as this Combat was for life, and that in euery fight of such
nature, no victory is fully gained vntill the Defender is slaine, or els forced
to yeeld or denie; it seemeth that he is not to be iudged guiltie, not hauing
done any of these, although his sword were lost, which indeed in all martiall
exercises, and feates of Armes is a thing much to be discommended.
But most certaine it is, that in all Combats and actions, for honor, loue,
and praise onely, whosoeuer loseth his sword, must presently also lose the
honor and victory.
                  Two Gentlemen fighting for life within the Listes, the one yeeldeth
himselfe a prisoner. Whether may the Prince of the place (who in combat
is elected a Iudge) saue the life of him that is vanquished. Hereunto
may be answered:
                  That albeit euery prisoner appertaineth vnto his taker, yet hath it commonly
bene vsed, that the victorious haue presented their prisoners vnto

the Prince, to be disposed at his good pleasure, who in recompense thereof,
doe vse according to the magnanimous mindes of such persons, not
onely to pay the charges of the victorious, but also in signe of clemencie
and mercie, set the infortunate prisoner freely at libertie. As did the noble
King Edward the third of England, vnto Iohn Visconti, who in his presence
was vanquished by Thomas de la March base sonne vnto the French
King. And Philip Duke of Millain did the like vnto an vnfortunate Gentleman
vanquished by a Neoplitane Knight.

                     A Man that loseth his sword in fight, is more reproched then
he that loseth his shield. For he gaineth the greatest honor
that winneth the chiefe weapon from the enemie, which is
the sword, seeing therewith the Emperour and Kings doe
create their Knights, and the sword is borne before them in
in signe of authoritie and Regal power.
                  He that loseth his headpiece in fight, is more dishonoured, then he that
loseth his shield, because the Helmet defendeth the most principal part of
man, but the shield armeth a lower place.
                  He that loseth his Gauntlet in fight, is more to be blamed, then he who
is disarmed of his Poulderon. For the Gauntlet armeth the hand, without
which member no fight can be performed, and therefore that part of Armor
is commonly sent in signe of defiance.
                  He that is cast out of the Saddle by violence of his aduersaries encounter,
shal be more reproued, then he who falleth by the default of his horse,
the breaking of Girthes, or any such like accident.

is a member seruing the most necessarie sence, but the
teeth are onely instruments of the mouth. He that loseth
his right eye, is more to be reproached, then he that
loseth the left eye, because the right side is in better opinion

of men. The like is to be sayd of the hands, of the armes and legges.
If a man hauing but one eye doe fight with another man that hath two, in
losing that one eye, he shall be more blamed, then he who hath two eyes,
although he loseth one. He that loseth his whole hand shall be more reproached,
then he who loseth one eye. And he that loseth a foot, is more
disgraced then he that loseth one hand.

                     FIrst the Cartell or Bill of Quarrell, aswell of the Challengers
behalfe as of the Defenders, was brought into the Court,
before the Constable and Marshall. And when the trueth
of the cause of quarrell, could not be prooued by witnesse,
nor otherwise, then was it permitted the same should receiue
triall by force of Armes, the one partie by assayling, the other by defending.
The Constable as Vicar generall vnto the King assigned the day
of battell, which was to be performed within forty dayes next following,
whereunto both the Challenger and Defender condscended. Then were

the Combattants commaunded to bring in sufficient pledges for suertie,
that they and euery of them should appeare, and performe the combat,
betwixt the sunne rising, and going done of the day appointed for the acquirall
of their pledges, and that they nor any of them, should doe or cause
to be done any molestation, damage, assault or subtiltie against the person
of his enemie, either by himselfe, his friends, his followers, or other person
whatsoeuer.
                  
                     In what sort the King commanded the place of
Combat to be made.
                     THe Kings pleasure being signified vnto the Cōstable & Marshal, they
caused Lists or Rayles to be made, and set vp in length threescore paces,
and in breadth fortie paces. The place where the Lists were appointed,
was euer vpon plaine and drie ground, without ridges, hilles, or other
impediments. At either end of the Lists was made a gate or place of entrie,
with a strong barre to keepe out the people. For the guarding of either
gate one Sergeant at Armes was appointed, and commanded not to suffer
any man to approch within foure foote. The one gate opened towards the
East, the other towards the West, being strongly barred with a raile of
seuen foote long, and of such height, as no horse could passe vnder or ouer
the same.
                  
                  
                     In what sort the King did sit to behold the Combat.
                     ON the day of battell, the King vsed to sit on a high seat or Scaffold
purposely made, at the foote whereof was another seat for the Constable
and Marshall, who being come thither, called before them the
pledges aswell of the Defendant, as of the Challenger, to be shewed and
presented vnto the King, there to remaine within the Lists as prisoners, vntill
such time as the Chalenger and Defender were come, and had performed
all their Ceremonies.
                  
                  
                     In what sort the Challenger vsed to present
himselfe to Combat.
                     THe Challenger did commonly come to the East gate of the Lists, and
brought with him such armors as were appointed by the Court, and
wherewith he determined to fight. Being at the gate, there he stayed vntill
such time as the Constable and Marshall arose from their seate, and
went thither. They being come to the said gate of the Lists, & beholding
the Challenger there, the Constable said, For what cause art thou come
hither thus armed? and what is thy name? vnto whom the Challenger answered
thus: My name is A. B. and am hither come armed and mounted,
to performe my challenge against G. D. and acquit my pledges. Wherefore
I humbly desire this gate may be opened, and I suffered to performe
my intent and purpose. Then the Constable did open the visor of his
headpeece to see his face, and thereby to knowe that man to be he who
makes the challenge.
                     These Ceremonies ended, the Constable commanded the gate of the

Lists to be opened, whereat the armed man with his necessaries and councell
entered. From thence he was brought before the King, where he remained,
vntill such time as the Defender was come thither.
                     In like manner the Defender appearing did make request vnto the Constable
and Marshal, desiring they would be pleased to deliuer and discharge
his pledges. Whereupon the said Constable and Marshall did humbly
desire the King to release them, because the Defender is alreadie come, and
presented before his Maiestie, there to performe his duetie.
                     But in case the Defender did not come at time conuenient in the day appointed,
then did the King deliuer his pleasure vnto the Constable, and
he reported the same vnto the Marshall, who forthwith did giue order vnto
the Lieutenant, that the Defender should presently bee called to appeare
by the Herald Marshall of the King of the South, called Clarencieux:
and in case the Herauld Marshall of the King of the South was not present,
then was the proclamation made by some other Herauld. But if the combat
were performed in the North, on the other side of the Riuer of Trent,
in the circuit of the King of the North called Norrey, then was his Marshall
to make proclamation. The words whereof were to this effect.
                     Oiez, G. D. Defendant in this Combat, appeare now, for in this day
thou hast taken vpon thee to acquit thy pledges in presence of the Lords,
Constable and Marshall, and also defend thy person against A. B. who
challenged thee to maintaine the cause of this Combat.
                     This Proclamation was made thrice at euery corner of the Lists: but if
at the second time the partie appeared not, then the Herauld did adde
these words: The day passeth, and therefore come without delay. And if
in case the said Defendant appeared not before noone, but stayed vntil the
third houre after, then did the Herauld by commandement of the Constable
and Marshall, in the beginning of the proclamation say, A. B. appeare
in haste, and saue thine honour, for the day is well neere spent, wherein
thou didst promise to performe thine enterprise.
                     It was also vsed that the Constables Clerke, should in a booke record
the houre of the Combattants appearing within the Lists, either on foot
or on horsebacke, in what sort they were armed, of what colour the horses
were, and how they were in all points furnished.
                     It was also anciently vsed, that the Constable moued the King in fauour
of the Combattants, to knowe whether his Maiestie were pleased to appoint
any of his Nobility or other seruants of reputation, to assist them for
counsell in combat.
                     The Constable and Marshall did suruey the Launces and other weapons,
wherewith the combat should be performed, making them equall,
and of euen measure.
                     The Constable also appointed two Knights or Esquires vnto the Challenger,
to keepe the place free from impediments: the like was also done for
the Defender.
                     The Constable did also moue the King, to know whether his Maiestie
in person would take the Oathes of the fighters, or giue him and the Marshall
authority to doe it out of his presence.
                     
                        
The Constable also did send the Marshall vnto the Challenger, and his
counsell to make ready his Oath, declaring that after that ceremonie all
protestations should be voide.
                     After these preparations, the Constable caused his Clerke to bring
foorth the booke, whereupon the Combattants were solemnely sworne.
                  
                  
                     The first Oath.
                     THe Constable hauing caused his Clerke to reade the Challengers bill,
and calling him by his name, sayd, Doest thou conceiue the effect of
this Bill? Here is also thine owne Gauntlet of defiance. Thou shalt sweare
by the holy Euangelists, that all things therein contained be true, and that
thou maintaine it so to be, vpon the person of thine aduersary, as God shall
helpe thee, and the holy Euangelists.
                     The Oath thus taken, hee was led backe vnto his former place, and the
Constable did cause the Marshall to produce the Defender, who tooke
the like Oath. This Oath was euer taken the parties kneeling, vnlesse it
pleased the Constable and Marshall to pardon that duetie.
                  
                  
                     The second Oath.
                     THe second Oath was also indifferently propounded to either of them,
viz. That they had not brought into the Lists other Armour or weapon
then was allowed, neither any engin, instrument, herbe, charme, or enchantment,
and that neither of them ▪ should put affiance or trust in any
thing other then God, and their owne valors, as God and the holy Euangelists
should helpe them. That done they were both sent to their places
of entrie.
                  
                  
                     The third Oath was thus.
                     THe combattants being againe called, were commanded by the Constable
to take one the other by the hand, and lay their left hands vpon
the booke: which done, the Constable said, I charge thee A. B. challenger
vpon thy faith, that thou doe thine vttermost endeauour and force to
prooue thine affirmation, either by death or deniall of thine aduersary,
before hee departeth these Lists, and before the Sunne goeth downe this
day, as God and the holy Euangelists shall helpe thee.
                     The very same Oath in like manner vsed, was offered vnto the Defender,
& that done, the combatants returned vnto their places, their friends,
and counsellors.
                     These ceremonies ended, the Herauld by commandement of the Constable
and Marshall, did make proclamation at foure corners of the Listes,
thus: Oiez, Oiez: We charge and commaund in the name of the King, the
Constable and Marshall, that no man of what estate, title, or degree soeuer,
shall approach the Lists neerer then foure foote in distance, nor shall vtter
any speech, word, voice, or countenance, wherby either the Challenger or
Defender may take aduantage vpon paine of losse of life, liuing, and goods,
to be taken at the Kings good pleasure.
                     Then the Constable and Marshall assigned a place conuenient within

the Lists, where the Kings of Armes, Heraulds, and other Officers should
stand and be ready if they were called: for afterwards, all things were committed
vnto their charge as well on the behalfe of the defender as the challenger,
as if any thing were forgotten in their confessions, either touching
their lands or consciences; or that any of them desired to eate or drinke:
all those wants were supplyed by the Heraulds and none other.
                     But here is to be noted, that no meate or drinke might be giuen to the
Challenger, without leaue first asked of the Defender, who commonly did
not deny the request. And after the Herauld went vnto the Constable and
Marshall, and made them priuy thereunto, desiring their fauours, that the
combattants might eate, drinke, or ease their bodies, if need were.
                     After these orders taken, the Constable and Marshall did auoid the Lists
of all sorts of persons, saue onely one Knight and two Esquiers armed, to
attend the Constable: and the like number to await on the Marshall, either
of them hauing in his hand a Launce without head, ready to depart the
Combattants, if the King did command.
                     Of more ancient time the Constable and Marshal vsed to haue certaine
Lieutenants and seruants within the Lists. Also the one part to keepe order
on one side, and the others to looke vnto the other side. And if the
Queene happened to behold the combat, then the Constable and Marshall
awaited on the Kings side, and their Lieutenants attended on the
Queene.
                     Then did the Constable alone, sitting downe before the King, send his
Lieutenant to the Challenger to come vnto him, and the Marshall with
his Lieutenant did accompany the Defender.
                     The Constable thus set, did pronounce his speech with a loud voice:
Let them goe, let them goe, let them goe, and doe their best.
                     Vpon which words pronounced, in the Kings presence, the Challenger
did march towards the Defender to assaile him furiously, and the other prepared
himselfe for defence, as best he might.
                     In the meane time, the Constable and Marshall with their Lieutenants,
stood circumspectly to heare and see if any worde, signe, or voice of yeelding
were vttered by either of the fighters, and also to be ready if the King
should command the Lances to be let fall, to depart the fight.
                     The Constable and Marshall did also take regard, that the Challenger
and Defender should appeare at the day and houre appointed, whether
they had about them any engine, or other vnlawfull things, as charmes or
enchantment: yet was it lawfull both for the Challenger and Defender, to
be as well and surely armed as they could. And if any of them would haue
his sword shorter then the Standard, yet was not the other bound to 
                           •
                        aue
his cut to that measure, if he required that fauour of the Court. But if either
the one or the others sword passed the Standerd, then was that inequality
to be reformed, or if they were both ouer long, both ought be reformed.
                     It had beene also in more ancient time vsed, that the Constable & Marshall
should foresee, that if the Kings pleasure was to depart the fight, and
suffer the combatants to rest before the combat ended, that they should be

parted in due time, when no aduantage were. Likewise that they should
take heed that none of them should priuatly speake vnto the other of yeelding,
or otherwise. For vnto the Constable and Marshall appertained the
witnessing and record of all things.
                     And in case the combat were for question of treason, he that was vanquished
should be forthwith disarmed within the Lists, by cōmandement
of the Constable and the Marshall. Also the armour and weapons of the
vanquished was in one end of the Lists defaced, to his disgrace; and after,
the same drawen out together with his horse. From thence also the man
vanquished was drawne vnto the place of execution, to be there headed
or hanged, according to the custome of the countrey.
                     The performance of all which punishment appertained onely to the
Marshall, who ought see all things done in his owne presence. And in case
the Chalenger did not vanquish the Enemy, then ought he suffer the same
paines that are due to the Defender, if he were vanquished. But if the quarell
were vpon a crime of lesse importance, the party vanquished should
not be drawen vnto the place of execution, but onely led thither to receiue
death or other punishment, according to the quality of the crime.
                     If the combat were onely for triall of vertue or honour, he that was vanquished
therein, should be disarmed, and put out of the Lists without further
punishment.
                     If it happened that the King would take the quarell into his hand, and
make peace betweene the parties without longer fight; then did the Constable
lead the one, and the Marshall the other out of the Listes at seuerall
gates, armed and mounted as they were, hauing speciall regard, that neither
of them should goe the one before the other. For the quarell resting in the
Kings hand, night not be renued, or any violence offered without preiudice
vnto the Kings honour. And because it is a point very speciall in matters
of Armes, that he who leaueth the Lists first incurreth a note of dishonour:
therfore to depart the Lists in due time was euer precisely obserued,
were the combat for treason, or other cause whatsoeuer.
                     It is also to be remembred, that without the principall Lists were euer
certaine counterlists, betwixt which two, the seruants of the Constable
and Marshall did stand. There stood also the Kings Sergeants at Armes, to
see and consider if any default or offence were committed contrary to the
proclamation of the Court, against the Kings royall Maiesty, or the Lawe
of Armes. Those men were euer armed at all peeces.
                     The seruants of the Constable and Marshall had charge of the place,
and good order thereof. The Kings Sergeants tooke care to keep the gates
of the Lists, and be there ready to make arrest of any person, when they
should be commaunded by the Constable or Marshall. The fees of the
Marshall were all horses, peeces of Armour, or other furniture that fell to
the ground, after the Combattants did enter into the Lists, aswell from the
Challenger as the Defender. But all the rest appertained to the partie victorious,
whether he were Challenger or Defender.
                     The Barres, Posts, Railes, and euery other part of the Lists were also the
fees of the Marshall.
                  
                  
                     
                     Certaine Combats granted by the Kings
of England.
                     
                        EDmund of the race of West Saxons, fought in Combat with Canutus King
of Denmark for the possession of the Crowne of England. In which
fight, both the Princes being weary, by consent parted the land betwixt
them. Anno 1016.
                     
                        Robert Mountfort accused Henry of Essex of treason, affirming, that hee
in a iourney toward Wales neere vnto Colshill, threw away the Kings Standerd,
saying the King was dead, and turned backe those that went to the
Kings succour. Henry denied the accusation, so as the matter was to bee
tried by Combat; The place appointed for fight, was a little Isle neere vnto
Reding. In this Combat Henry was vaquished, and fell downe dead, and
at the sute of friends, license was obteined that his body might be buried
by the Monks of Reding. But it happened that the said Henry recouered, and
became a Monke in that Abbey. Anno 1163. In the raigne of King Henry
the second.
                     
                        Henry duke of Hereford accused Thomas Mowbray duke of Norfolke of
certaine words by him spoken, as they rode betweene London and Braineford,
tending vnto the Kings dishonour. Thomas duke of Norfolke denied
to haue spoken any such word, but Henry affirming his accusation, the King
granted the Combat, to be performed at Couentry the seuenth of September
1398. Anno Rich. 2. but the combat was not performed, for th' one and
th'other party was banished the Realme.
                     A combat was fought at Westminster in the Kings presence, betweene
Iohn Ansley Knight, and Thomas Catrington Esquier, whom the said Knight
had accused of treason, for selling the castle of S. Sauiours, which the Lord
Chandos had builded in the Isle of Constantine in France. In which combat
the Knight was victorious. Anno 1374. Rich. 2.
                     A combat was granted vnto an Esquier borne in Nauar to fight with an
English Esquier called Iohn Welsh, whom the Nauarrois accused of Treason.
But the true cause of the Nauarrois his malice was, that the said Welsh
had dishonoured his wife, as (being vanquished) he confessed. The King
gaue sentence he should be drawne and hanged. Anno 1344. Rich. 2.
                     A combat was fought betweene sir Richard Wooduile, and one other
Knight borne in Spaine. After the thirde blow giuen, the King stayed the
fight. Anno 1441. Henrici 6.
                     A combat was granted vnto Iohn Viscount borne in Cypres, and Thomas
de la Marsh Bastard sonne vnto Philip King of France, in the raigne of king
Edward the third at Westminster.

                  Of Triumphs Ancient and Moderne.
                  
                     TRiumphs haue bene commonly vsed at the Inauguration
and Coronation of Emperors, Kings and Princes: at their
Mariages, Entry of cities, Enteruiewes, Progresses and Funerals.
Those pompous shewes, were first inuented and
practised by the Romanes: whom d
                        •
                     uers other Princes
haue imitated: though hard it was, (and happily impossible) for any Prince
to equal them in magnificence. Yet reade we may, that Xerxes, Darius and
Alexander the great, were Princes of marueilous puissance, and for triumphs
admirable. Howsoeuer those matters were handled, certein it is,
that albeit our Princes of Europe (in respect of Christian religion) doe, in
some sort, contemne excesse of Mundane glory, yet haue they euer liued
royally, and at occasions, triumphed, with princely honour and greatnes;
according to the measure of their Empires; as shall hereafter appeare.
                  But first we haue thought good to speake of Romane Triumphs, and
briefly to touch in what order they triumphed: for to report them at large
were a labour almost infinite.
               
               
                  CHAP. 19.
                  Of Triumphes and their originall.
                  
                     
                        VArro saith, That Princes and great Captaines being returned
to Rome with victory, were allowed to passe with their
armie through the citie vnto the Capitall, singing Io. Triumphe:
Io. Triumphe.
                  
                  The first inuentour of Triumphes was Liber Pater, as
Pliny saith. Yet certaine it is, (and so by lawe prouided)
that no man should be admitted to Triumph, vnlesse he had vanquished
full fiue thousand enemies.
                  
                     Cato and Martius (Tribunes of the people) by law also decreed, that
who so vntruely reported the enterprize he had done, should incurre punishement.
Therefore entring into the citie, euery Triumpher did first come
before the Questors, and deliuer his actions in writing, and sweare they
were true.
                  It was likewise by law prouided, and by custome also obserued, that only
for recouery of dominion, no man should bee permitted to triumph.
Which was the cause that neither Publius Scipio for the recouery of Spaine,
not Marcus Marcellus for taking of Syracusa, were suffered to triumph.
                  
                     
The first that imitated Liber Pater in triumphing was Titus Tatius, when
he triumphed for victory of the Sabini, yet was that no full triumph, but
(as they called it) Ouante, because his victorie was not great, and without
blood. For the same reason the crowne he ware, was made of Myrtel,
which euer after was the crowne of all Captains that triumphed for victories
of meane reputation.
                  In that age also it was vnlawfull for any man to triumph, vnlesse he were
a Dictator, a Consull, or a Praetor. Therefore L. Lentulus being Proconful,
although he had performed great seruices in Spaine, yet was he not admitted
to enter Rome, but Ouante.
                  
                  Afterwards Scipio most instantly required to triumph, hauing deserued
great glory, but till that time no man (without office) had triumphed.
                  Likewise C. Manlius, by the base people elected the first Dictator, by
their commandement also without allowance of the Patritij, did triumph.
                  And Gneus Pompeius a Gentleman Romaine, before he was of age to be
Consull, triumphed twise.
                  Another law or custome there was, that no Captaine might triumph,
vntill he had brough backe the armie: and therewith also deliuered the
country of his charge, quiet, into the hand of his successour. For Lucius
Manlius the Consull, hauing effected great victories in Spaine, was (in the
Hall of Bellona) denied to triumph, because the countrey where he commanded,
was not in peace, as Liuie reporteth.
               
               
                  CHAP. 20.
                  The maner of triumphing and the habits of
the Triumpher in Rome.
                  
                     THe Prince or Captaine that triumphed was euer drawen in
a chariot, as appeareth by the Arke Triumphall of Titus
and Vespatian, and likewise by that of L. Verus Antoninus
made of marble, yet extant in Rome. This Arke was drawen
by foure white horses. Others vsed in their chariots white
Buls or Elephants. As Pompei triumphing of Affrica had in his chariot
Elephants onely. But Caesar surpassing all others in pompe was drawen by
forty Elephants, and in the day time conducted to the Capitoll, with torches,
when he triumphed ouer the Galli.
                  
                  Some writers haue said that the Emperour Aurelianus was drawen with
foure Harts or Stags, and being come to the Capitoll, he caused them all
to be slaine, and sacrificed to Iupiter Optimus Maximus.
                  
                  Other Historians haue noted, that some triumphs haue continued more
then one day: As Titus Quintius Flaminius held his triumph of the Macedonians
& Grecians, three dayes. Likewise Suetonius triumphed foure daies

in one moneth: and Augustus triumphing of the Dalmatians, Acciaci, and Alexandria,
had three chariots for three dayes.
                  The Triumpher also vsed to carry in his chariot his owne children,
which custome Cicero seemeth to confirme in his Oration for Murena, saying
that Aemilius Paulus caried in triumph his sonne, who within three daies
after died.
                  
                     Adrianus hauing obtained of the Senate to triumph, he modestly refused
it, saying, that honour was due to Traianus. And so (as a good Emperour)
he caused Traianus picture to be caried in the chariot, fearing that after his
death, he should loose the honour of the triumph.
                  
                     Marcus and Lucius Antonius being brethren, and triumphing together,
they caried in their chariot the daughter of Marcus a yong virgin.
                  
                     Commodus the Emperour, a man of immodest maners, and vnworthy of
all Emperiall honour, being returned to Rome caried in the chariot with
him his vicious Anterus, who being placed neere his person, as he passed the
citie, he ofttimes kissed him publiquely.
                  Farre otherwise did Seuerus Afer, who being victorious of the Parthians
was offered the honour of triumph: which he refused, alleaging he was
vnhealthie: and therefore desired his sonnes might be set in the chariot to
triumph in his place.
                  Thus appeareth it that the Romanes accompted no honor too much or
too great for those that had in their seruice vertuously employed themselues.
After the triumphall chariot followed the chiefe prisoners bound.
                  Then came many captaines and souldiers wearing boughs of Lawrel, in
signe of victorie. Being also perswaded that by vertue of that tree they
were purged of mans slaughter. Lawrell is also a cause of good fortune,
and a signe of prosperitie, because it is euer greene and flourishing. As Plinie
writeth, saying, Laurus triumphis dicatur: Caesarum Pontificum
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         sola domos
exornat, & ante limina excubat. Yet the same Plinie saith that in times
more ancient, he that triumphed, did vse a crowne Etrusca of gold, which
by a seruant was caried, and on his finger a ring of yron, to signifie that the
fortune of him that triumphed, and his seruant, was alike. In this manner
Caius Marius triumphed of Iugurtha▪
                      yet in his third triumph he ware a ring
of gold.
                  
                     Tarquinius Priscus at his triumph ware a coate of gold, as Plinie and others
affirme.
                  One other custome the Romanes had, and was no ordinance or law, yet
precisely obserued; which is, that whosoeuer in any ciuil warre had gained
victorie (how notable soeuer) he should not be admitted to triumph:
because men therein slaine, were Citizens, and no strangers, which was
the reason that Nasica hauing vanquished Tiberius Gracchus and his folowers,
nor Metellus suppressing Caius Opimius, nor Antonius defeating Catilina,
were admitted to triumph.
                  Neuerthelesse when Lucius Sylla had surprised the cities of Graecia, and
taken the Marian citizens, he was allowed in triumphant wise to carie with
him the spoiles gained in those places.

                  Of the diuers qualitie of Triumphs in Rome.
                  
                     SOme Triumphs were full and entire: others of lesse pompe
and state, they were called Ouanti. But why they were so
called, writers doe not agree.
                  Triumphs absolute haue bene formerly discoursed. Now
are we to speake of meane or halfe triumphs.
                  
                     Plutarch seemeth to thinke, that who so in this kind triumphed, did sacrifice
in the Capitol a sheepe: but he that was allowed a full triumph, did
offer a Bull.
                  
                     Dionysius sayth, that Ouatio, differeth from Triumphus by this meane.
He that entered the city Ouans, had no chariot, nor vsed any regal garment
but marched with the Armie on foot. Plutarch likewise writeth they ware
in their Crowne no Laurel, but Mirtle.
                  This kinde of Triumph was instituted in Rome in the yeere 253. ab vrbe
condita.
                  
                  
                     Dionysius and Plutarch, are not of one opinion, why this sort of Triumph
was called Ouante. Yet this seemeth the cause.
                  
                     Posthumius being Consul, in his seruice of the warre proceeded coldly and
sparing of blood.
                  Also in one other expedition before, he fought most infortunately, with
losse of many men, and by fleeing saued his owne person.
                  Other causes do seeme of this Triumph Ouante: as if the warre was not
iustly pronounced, or the enemie of base reputation, as a Pirate, a bondman,
or a coward.
                  So as the victory obtained, doth appeare vnworthy much honour. Either
els if the warre receiued end by word, and no violence. Or if the seruice
were done in a forreine countrey, by authority of another Prince, or
without lawfull aut
                        •
                     ority.
                  Whether the Triumpher Ouante did enter the citie on horsebacke or
foot, is a question.
                  Another vse also the Souldiers had, which haply will seeme strange;
that following the triumphall chariot, oft times they vttered scoffes and
iests against the Triumpher? Such was the behauiour of Caesars folowers at
his Triumph. For among other speeches they vsed these words: Gallias
Caesar subegit, Nicomedes Caesarem: & Ventidium Bassum Parthici triumphi die
secuti milites decantarunt; Qui mulos fricabat, factus est Consul.
                  
                  In Rome it was by law prouided that no Captaine should come into the
citie before his triumph: So saith Plutarch in the life of Paulus Aemilius.
                  
                  We reade likewise, all Triumphs were celebrated in Rome onely, two
excepted, which seemeth strange. For in those dayes Milan, Aquileia, and
Constantinople were cities of great fame.
                  
                     
                     Papirius Cursor triumphed first in Monte Albano, for his victory against
the Corsi: as Plinie reporteth. And Papirius Maso, not permitted to triumph
in the citie, he triumphed in Monte Albano.
                  
                  
                     Paulus Orosius the last that hath written of the Roman Empire, saith that
the number of triumphs in Rome is 320.

                  In what order the Romanes triumphed.
                  
                     THe first triumph in Rome, was that of King Tatius.
                  
                  Next to him Tarquinius Priscus the King triumphed. But
in what sort these Kings did triumph, we cannot finde.
                  After the expulsion of the Tarquinij, and the death of Brutus,
Publius Valerius the Consul triumphed.
                  Then, with greater pomp and admiration the Dictator Camillus triumphed,
who sitting in a chariot drawen by two white horses, entred the citie.
Which maner of triumph was neuer before seene, therefore mooued
much enuie.
                  Many yeeres after was the triumph of Papirius Cursor Dictator, who triumphed
for victorie of the Samniti.
                  
                  
                     Quintus Fabius also triumphed of the Galli, Etrusci and Samniti.
                  
                  Then followed againe the triumph of Papirius Cursor the Consul, when
he brought home the Armie from Samnio. He furnished his triumph with
many prisoners both horsmen and footmen, with crownes Ciuicae, Vallarae,
and Murales, cariyng with him spoiles of the Samniti, and leading many
honourable captiues: hee brought with him also two hundred thousand
and thirtie three thousand pound weight of treasure. All which money
was deliuered into the treasurie, and no part thereof giuen to the souldier.
                  With greater ioy the two Consuls, Claudius Nero and Liuius Salinator,
triumphed for their victory, hauing defeated Hasarubal and slaine him, yet
was this triumph in magnificence farre inferiour: but the treasure they
brought to the city was an hundred thousand pound weight, whereof 23.
thousand was diuided among the Souldiers.
                  But farre more magnificent was the triumph of Scipio, who being returned
from Libya triumphed at Rome, in this sort. First hee caused certaine
Trumpets to sound: after them followed chariots laden with spoyle: then
were caried towers of wood, made for models of those cities which were
taken. Next were the cariages of golde and siluer, part whereof was vnwrought,
and part coyne: next were certaine crownes caried in signe of
honor at the winning of cities, which were followed with white Buls and
Elephants: after them came the captiue Princes of Carthage and Numidia.
Before Scipio his person, marched his Lictori or Mace-bearers apparelled in
purple, and accompanied with diuers sorts of musicke and singers. These
men had on their heads crownes, wearing also garments of silke cut. In

marching euery of them one after another, sung some verse in praise of the
victory; making also gesture to mooue mirth. The chariot of Scipio was
richly wrought with gold, and neere to his person also many sweete perfumes
were burned. The horses of his chariot were white, and on their
heads they ware crowns: their foretops and maynes were curled, and dressed
with gold, and precious stones.
                  
                     Scipio himselfe was apparelled in purple, embroidered with starres of
gold, according to the Romane fashion. In the one hand he bare a scepter
of Iuory, in the other a braunch of Laurell, which among the Romanes
were signes of victory. About him were caried certaine young boyes and
virgins, and at his stirrup marched some young men of his blood. Lastly
followed his guard, and their Ensignes, with the army diuided into squadrons.
The Souldiers of best seruice caried in their hand abranch of Laurell;
and certaine Musicians did sing their praise. Others of no merit bare
no Laurell, as persons noted of infamy. By which manner of Triumph, the
honour or disgrace of euery one did appeare.
                  
                     Scipio being thus ariued in the Capitoll, laide aside his pompe, and (as
the custome then was) feasted his company in the Temple.
                  Some time after, Marcus Porcius Cato triumphed of Spaine, with honour
comparable. He brought with him twenty fiue pound weight of vnwrought
siluer, and of gold one thousand fiue hundred. To euery footman
he gaue two hundred and seuenty pieces: and to euery horseman thrice so
much.
                  About that time, Lucius Quintius triumphed three dayes.
                  The first day he shewed the Armour, weapons, and ensignes taken from
Philip and his cities.
                  The second day hee shewed the siluer and gold, both wrought and vnwrought.
The siluer vnwrought was eighteene thousand pound weight,
and the gold two hundreth seuenty thousand pound weight. Besides treasure,
were many vessels of all sorts; with them also were many head-pieces,
excellently and artificially wrought: ten targuets of siluer, and one of gold:
besides great pieces of coyne of incredible poize; among which, was of
king Philips coine in gold, fourteene thousand and fiue hundreth and foureteene
pieces.
                  The third day hee shewed the crownes of gold, and the gifts of cities,
wherewith he had beene presented. Before h
                        •
                     s chariot marched many noble
prisoners, among whome was Demetrius the sonne of King Philip, and
Armenes the sonne of Nabides the Lacedaemonian.
                  
                  Then Quintius in person entred the City, his chariot beeing followed
with great numbers of Souldiers. Then much treasure was diuided, one
part to a footeman, two parts to a Centurion, and three parts to a Horseman.
Those prisoners that were exempt from bondage, ware their heads
polled in signe of liberty.
                  After Quintius, Pub. Cornelius Nasica triumphed for victory of the Boij.
                  
                  The pompe of Cornelius was numbred among the triumphs of meane
magnificence. Hee brought with him the Armes, Ensignes, and Pillage
taken from the Gaules. Also certaine noble prisoners and troupes of

horses taken from other enemies. Besides these spoyles, he shewed chaines
of gold: and one thousand foure hundred seuenty pound weight of siluer,
of golde 246. pound weight: in vessels of the French fashion 360. pound
weight.
                  Hee had likewise peeces of coyne whereon was imprinted a chariot
drawen by two horses. Of them were a hundred thirty and eight thousand,
which were giuen to the Souldiers.
                  Now may we not omit the triumph of Marcus Flauius, who determined
to triumph: but hearing Aemilius was comming to Rome, hee fell sicke, and
deferred his triumph to auoid contention. The next Ianuary he triumphed
of the Etoli and Cephalonia. Before his chariot were caried crownes of gold
weighing an hundred and twelue pounds, of siluer 83. pound weight, with
other spoiles incredible.
                  Ouer long it were to tell of all the Romane triumphs, and their magnificence,
being greater then can be expressed.
                  Let vs only remember the triumph of Gaius Manlius, who brought into
Rome 200. kings crownes of gold, 220. thousand pound weight of siluer,
with other coynes of diuers Nations. Hee caried also great spoiles, taken
from King Alexander, and from the Gaules. In this triumph he set before
his chariot two and fifty captaines prisoners, and rewarded his owne souldiours
abundantly.

                  Of other furniture and pompe appertaining
to triumphs in Rome.
                  
                     IN those ancient times, the Triumphs were also ornified
with Arks, Pillars, Obelisks, Pyramides, & diuers demonstrations
of magnificence.
                  Who so had prosperously preuailed in the warre, and
obtained victory in any forrein Countrey, did commonly
erect an Arke triumphall, whereon was grauen or painted his proceeding
in the victory. Plinie writeth that in his life, these triumphall Arkes were
first made, and by the Triumphers offered to Iupiter in the Capitol.
                  The most ancient Arke now extant in Rome, is that of Titus, before
whose dayes Portratures, & many other triumphal ornaments were in vse;
whereof to speake now were tedious.

                  The triumphall going of Darius to meete
Alexander the Great.
                  
                     TO speake of all Romane triumphs were a matter infinite:
wee will therefore cease to say more of them, and speake of
others performed elswhere. And first how Darius marched
to meet with Alexander.
                  
                  The Persian vse was, that so soone as the Sunne shined
in the morning, a trumpet was sounded in the Kings Pauilion, which warned
euery man to come forth.
                  Vpon the roofe of the Kings Pauilion, an image of the Sunne closed in
Christall was set, which shined exceedingly, and might bee seene many
miles.
                  The order of the Kings company, when he marched, was this:
                  First the fire (which they called holy and euerlasting) was caried vpon
Altars of siluer.
                  Next to those Altars went the Magi or sorcerers, singing certaine Persian
verses.
                  The number of the Magi was three hundred three score and fiue.
                  After them followed 365 yong men, in Carthagenian attire, for the
Persian yeere containeth euen so many dayes.
                  Then a chariot consecrated to Iupiter did follow, euer drawen by foure
white horses of exceeding greatnes: they called those, Horses of the Sun.
Their raines were of gold, and their furniture white.
                  Not farre from this chariot, were twelue other chariots ornified with
gold and siluer.
                  Then marched more horsemen of twelue diuers nations, diuersly armed,
and of diuers qualitie.
                  Next to them were ten thousand men, whom the Persians called immortall.
Some ware chaines of gold, others had coates with sleeues embrodered
with gold, and set with rich stones.
                  Not farre off were fifteen thousand men, whom they called the Kings
cosins: which number was furnished rather richly (like women) then well
armed: they were called Doryphori.
                  
                  Next to this troupe were other men apparelled like Kings. They went
before the Kings chariot he being caried vp higher then any other. These
chariots were loden with Images of the gods, made of siluer and gold.
                  Betweene the Images a partition was set with rich shining iewels: the
one side represented a warre; and likewise the other.
                  Among these things they sacrificed an Eagle of golde spreading her
wings: but of all things, the Kings attire was most admired.
                  
                     
His apparell was of purple parted in the middes with white: and ouer
it he had a short cloke like a womans garment, embrodered with Sparow-haukes
of gold, very strangely.
                  His girdle was womanlike small and girt: whereat hanged a Scimiter,
or crooked sword: the sheath thereof was set with precious stones.
                  On his head he ware a royall cappe, called Cidaris, which all Kings of
Persia doe vse. It was tied on his head with a lace, part of skie colour and
part white.
                  After the chariot, followed ten thousand Lances, adorned with siluer:
and next to the chariot certaine choice men caried Darts gilded. Also on
either side, his neerest of blood did accompany him.
                  This troupe contained thirtie thousand footmen, whom fiue hundred
of the Kings horsemen followed.
                  About one acre distance from them the chariot of Sisygamba King Darius
mother, did come, and in one other his wife.
                  All the Ladies and other women belonging to both the Queenes, were
on horsebacke.
                  After them other women did come (whom they called Armamax:)
they exceeded not the number of fifteene.
                  In that company were the kings children, with their gouernours. Also
a number of Eunuches, being persons of some reputation among the
Persians.
                  Then the Kings Minions being 360 were caried in chariots: their apparell
was princely and rich.
                  After them the kings coine was caried by sixe hundred Mules and three
hundred Camels garded with Archers.
                  The Kings Concubines and his kinsmen were next to them. And they
being past, the Cookes, Sculions, and other base people did follow.
                  Last of all came certaine Captains and souldiers lightly armed, to force
the troupes to march in order.

                  The Triumphall entry of Xerxes King of Persia
into Greece: yet afterward forced for feare,
to flee into his owne kingdome.
                  
                     FIrst he sent before, all his carriage, and all those people that
were combred with any burden or other impediment.
                  After them followed seuenty hundred thousand men of
sundry Nations: who marched in no order, but confused.
Among whom was eightie thousand horsemen. All these
passed a good distance before the Kings person.
                  
                     
Then marched a thousand Gentlemen Persians, and with them so many
Launcers: who carried the point of their lances backward.
                  The next troope was onely ten horses most richly furnished: being of
the rase of Nicae: beastes of exceeding greatnesse and beautie.
                  These were followed with a chariot, consecrated to Iupiter, and drawen
by eight white horses. The man that did driue those horses, went on foot,
holding the reines in his hand. In this chariot vnlawful it was for any mortall
man to sit.
                  After it, Xerxes his owne person was carried in a chariot drawen by horses
of Niscaea. The driuer of them walked before on foote: his name was
Patiramphus the sonne of Ota, a Persian. In this sort Xerxes went towardes
the Sardi, sometimes sitting in his chariot, and sometimes on horsebacke.
                  Next to him followed the brauest and best men of Armes in Persia, carriyng
(as it were) halfe lances.
                  Then came ten thousand Persians on foote: one thousand bearing pikes,
and on the points of them (in stead of crownes) were siluer apples. Some
of them that went next to Xerxes, had apples of gold vpon their pikes.
                  These were followed with ten thousand other Persian horsemen.
                  Last of all, about two acres of ground behind, was a multitude of people
without order or number.

                  Of Triumphes in Germanie.
                  
                     
                        HEnry the first Emperour of that name, who for his great
delight in hawking and fowling, was called Auceps, being
aduertised of the often incursions of Hungarians into
Germany, thought good to assemble the Princes Anno
935. and by force of Armes to repulse them: which designe,
with the assent of those Lords, by publike proclamation
he made knowen: commaunding that euery Prince with his best
furniture vpon a day certaine should appeare at Magdeburg, which was
performed.
                  First, the Count Palatin of the Rhene appeared. The Bishop of Treuer:
The Bishop of Colein: The Bishop of Leyden. The cities Emperiall, Mentz,
Aquisgran, &c. All which companies the Palatin presented vnto the Emperour:
and vnder euery of those Princes colours, other meaner Princes
and Lords also appeared.
                  Vnder the Ensigne of the Palatine were the Duke of Elsatia, The Duke
of Thungren. The Duke of Limpu
                           •
                        g. The Marques of Pontamonson, with
sixe other Dukes.
                  Vnder the Ensigne of the Duke of Sueuia, were twelue other Lords.
                  The like vnder the Ensigne of Franconia, and all other chiefe Princes.
                  
                     
And last of all, were the Emperours companies. So was the number
of Princes, Lords, Knights and Gentlemen 6240.
                  The whole armie was sixtie nine thousand strong.
                  These Christian forces (assisted by the Almightie) defeated the Hungarians,
and slew the greater number.
                  The victorie obtayned, and the Emperour with his Princes returning
homewards, were in all places feasted. And they desirous in some sort to
honour the Ladies of those countries, where they passed, were willing in
triumphal wise, to make Iusts, Turneaments, and other Militarie pastimes.
Which being pleasing to the Emperour, and acceptable to all others; His
Maiestie with consent of the Princes, commanded that publike triumphs
should be proclaimed; whereunto all Princes, Lords, and Gentlemen
might resort, to shew their valour. And this was the originall of Germaine
triumphes.
                  Then was there a Counsell and commission graunted to certaine Princes
and other Lords, to inuent orders for the future Iusts, and appoint
places fit for their celebration.
                  The Commissioners considering what glory might of these exercises
accrew vnto the Germaine Nation: and therewith knowing that the exercise
of Armes was no small helpe to enforme Gentlemen, and make
them meete for serious seruices: not forgetting also that Noble Ladies
would take delight in such royall sight: they greatly commended that inuention
vnto the Emperour, who presently agreed that Lawes might be
made and obserued in those Actions.
                  His Emperial Maiestie commanded that at euery Triumph 4. chiefe
persons should be chosen to giue direction, and by their authoritie all Ordinances
to be made. Those men were called Reges Ludorum. The first
Kings were elected at the Triumph of Meydburg.

                  After the Emperour followed the Palatine of the Rheyn with his band,
containing 80. persons, among whom were 7. Princes and 16. Earles, viz.
                  
                     The Duke of Alsatia.
                     
                     The Duke of Barry.
                     
                     The Marques of Pontamonsa.
                     
                     The Duke of Lymburg.
                     The Duke of Burbon.
                     The Duke of Limburg.
                     The Earle of Burgondy,
and others.
                     Next to him followed the Duke of Sueuia with his band, containing
82. persons, of which number 9. were Dukes and Princes.
                     Next followed the Duke of Bauaria with his band containing 69. persons,
of whom 8. were Dukes and Princes.
                     Next followed the Duke of Franconia with his band, containing 80.
persons, of whom 4. were Princes.
                  
                  Besides these Bands appertaining to the Emperour, and the 4 principal
Princes of Germany (being the chiefe Nobility and Gentlemen) yet other
Princes also offered their Bands. viz.
                  
                     
                        Otho Duke of Thuringia the Emperours eldest sonne, presented 112.
persons: of whom 8. were Dukes or Princes.
                     Likewise Arnoldus the Emperors second sonne presented 85. persons:
among whom some were also Princes.
                  
                  To conclude, the number of Princes, Lords and Gentlemen that appeared
in these triumphes (before the fourth triumph was ended) amounted
vnto two thousand persons.
                  Then was there charge and commission giuen to Georgius Scuuabenlant
to be the Herault and pronouncer of all Orders and Ordinances concerning
those affaires. He also tooke notes how euery man was mounted, armed
and furnished. To him also appertained the publicatio
                        •
                      of what honour
or dishonour euery man deserued: and therewith to perswade that
no malice or quarrell should be among the Actors, but euery one with an
honourable emulation to do his best.
                  
                     
This Officer also proclaimed the priuiledges, and what Armes were to
be vsed: and that done, he assigned place where euery band should attend,
and in what order they should runne: which were long to be rehearsed.
                  The troopes of Lances thus marshalled, the beholders were permitted
to enter. But first of all the Princes, Ladies and women of honour did take
their places, of whose beauty, pompe, and rich attire no man needeth to
doubt. These women thus prepared, in passing to their places (with due
reuerence and thankes) set them downe: and the courses being runne, desired
that euery Actor might receiue the praise he deserued. Therewith also,
that the chief prizes might be allotted to the 4. Kings appointed for the
next triumph, which should be celebrated at Rauensburg vpon S. Iames day
Anno 941. which was 3. yeeres after this present triumph.
                  The prizes were deliuered according to the praises and pleasure of the
Ladies.
                  
                     This triumph and the ceremonies therof ended, it pleased
the Emperour to pronounce the first Article
to be obserued in all future triumphs, viz.
                     IT should bee lawfull for all Gentlemen well borne, to enter and fight in
these exercises of Armes; euer excepting such as in worde or deed had
blasphemed God, or done or said cōtrary to our Christian faith. Of whom
if any shall presume to enter the Lists, wee will and commaund, That the
Armes of his ancestours, with all other his furniture, shalbe cast out, his
horse confiscate, and in lieu of honour (which arrogantly and vnworthily
was sought) his person shalbe expulsed with perpetuall infamy.
                  
                  
                     The second Article was pronounced by the Pallatin:
the effect whereof was.
                     THat if any Lord or Gentleman whatsoeuer, hath or shall wittingly or
willingly say or do any thing in preiudice of the dignitie Emperiall or
profit thereof, hee shalbe repulsed from these exercises, and suffer the punishments
thereunto due.
                     I also ordaine and pronounce Meinolphus of Erbach to be King in the
celebration of the next triumph, and the chiefe leader of all my Nobilitie
of the Rhein.
                     
                  
                  
                     The third Article was pronounced by the Duke
of Sueuia, viz.
                     THat if any Gentleman (of what title soeuer) hath by word or deed dishonored
any virgin, widow, or other gentlewomā: or hath by force taken
or deteined any goods or lands to them or any of them belonging, he
shalbe iudged vnworthy to receiue fame and honour in these triumphs, hee
shall also forfeit his horses, and with infamy be expulsed the Lists. Such is
my censure irreuocable. I likewise constitute Carolus Lord of Hohenheuuen
to be a King in these triumphs, and Leader of the Nobility of Sueuia.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     The fourth Article was pronounced by the
Duke of Bauaria, viz.
                     THat forasmuch as nothing was more agreeable to the glory of God
and honour of the holy Empire, then trueth; I require that all men (of
what dignitie or title soeuer) being knowen vniust in their doings, and lyars,
should during their liues, remaine infamous. And if any person of such
quality shall offer to enter the Lists, I commaund him to be with dishonor
dismounted. I likewise pronounce George of Wolffarthuusen in my name, to
be King of the Prouince of Bauaria.
                     
                  
                  
                     The fifth Article was pronounced by Conradus Duke
of Franconia, to this effect.
                     THat whosoeuer hath betrayed or forsaken his master in the field or in
his iourney, or hath procured any other man so to doe: or if hee hath
not defended his countrey, his subiects & others committed to his charge,
as is the duety of a good man: or if wickedly he hath procured the trouble
of any person, or not defended him, but left them as a pray to the enemy,
then I command that euery such person shalbe for euer repulsed from the
celebration of these triumphs: hee shall also forfeit his horse, and endure
the ignominy due to men infamous. I also pronounce Ernestus of Grumbach
Esquier, to be King of the triumph within my circuit of Franconia.
                     
                  
                  
                     These Articles pronounced and written, the Emperor called
before him 15 men appointed to be Curatores ludorum
(as we may tearme them) Superuisors of the Triumph,
to whome he said, That forasmuch as he allowed and
much liked the pastime, his intention was to impart the
same to all Kings, Princes, and Potentates Christian: to
the ende that if any of their Nobilitie were louers of
Arms and honor, they might appeare in our Triumphs
with all things needful, on Munday next after S. Matthew
the Apostle. At Meydeburg.
                     THen his Maiesty was pleased with the aduise of the foure, and the fifteene
men aforesaid, to adde diuers other Articles, as followeth: That
If any man had either openly or secretly slaine his wife, or had aided or
counselled another man to kill his master, he should forfeit his horse, and
be expulsed the Lists.
                     If any man had committed sacriledge, by spoiling of Churches, or
Chappels, or had by force taken the goods of any widow or Orphan, or
not defended them to his power, he should forfeit his horse, and be punished
with infamy.
                     If any man without warning had assaulted his enemy, or by indirect
meanes had procured him to be robbed of corne, wine, or other prouision
feloniously, he should forfeit his horse, &c.
                     
                        
If any man in the Empire or vnder the Empire, rashly and without licence
of the Emperour, did impose new and vnaccustomed tributes, wherby
the people might be damnified, he should forfeit his horse, and be taxed
of infamy.
                     If any man had beene conuinced of notorious adultery, hauing himselfe
a wife, or being a Batcheler had by force defloured any matron, virgine,
or religious woman, he should forfeit his horse, & remaine infamous.
                     If any Gentleman borne being the Owner of lands and reuenue, and
not therewith contented, did exact or oppresse his Tenants; or being the
Officer of a Prince or other great Lord did wrest from his subiects, to enrich
himselfe: for so doing he should forfeit his horse, and be excluded
from the Lists with infamie.
                     All which Articles being publikely read and approued, were by his
Emperiall Maiestie confirmed as Law.

                  ¶Of Triumphs at the interuiewe of Pope Alexander,
and the Emperour Foedericus Barbarossa,
at Venice. Anno 1166.
                  
                     ADuertizement being giuen to Venice, that the Emperor resolued
to come thither, Piro Zinzano the Dukes sonne, was
sent with sixe long Galleyes to meete him at Rauenna. After
them were dispatched a great number of lesse vessels.
                  The Emperour being arriued at Venice, the Pope was set
in a rich chaire at the Church doore, and there taried his comming. Before
the Popes feet, a carpet of purple was spread vpon the ground.
                  The Emperor being come to the sayd Carpet, forthwith fel downe, and
from thence (vpon his knees) went towards the Pope, to kisse his feete:
which done, the Pope with his hand, lifted him vp.
                  From thence they passed together vnto the great Altar in S. Markes
Church, whereon was set the Table of precious stones, which at this day
is reputed one of the richest treasures of Europe.
                  
                  Some haue reported, that there the Emperor did prostrate himselfe
before the Altar, and the Pope set his foot vpon his necke.
                  While this was in doing, the Clergie sung that Psalme of Dauid, which
sayth: Super Aspidem & Basiliscum ambulabis.
                  
                  Which the Emperour hearing, sayd, Non tibi, sed Petro. The Pope replied,
Et mihi & Petro.
                  
                  After some dayes abode in Venice, the Pope departed by sea to Ancona,
and the Emperor towards Germany by land, either of them accompanied
with Gentlemen Venetians in great number.

                  ¶An admirable triumphal shew, at Venice, to
congratulate the recouery of Cyprus.
Anno. 1366.
                  
                     AFter thankes giuen to God for the recouery of this Island,
euery man endeuoured to make demonstration of gladnes;
wherin no cost in banquetting or other solemnization was
omitted.
                  Among these shewes of triumph and iolitie, two sights
there were most admirable, and neuer before that time seene: the maner of
the one was a representation of Iusting on horsebacke.
                  For certaine portratures or images of men and horses were so made, of
skinnes clothed in silke, with Lances and Shields, as the wind by a straight
line forced them to runne one encountering the other, like to a course of
the field.
                  The other was like vnto a combat: where armed men did seeme to fight,
both which shewes were in the streete.
                  In the first the Actors were only 24 yong Gentlemen Venetians, for
personage, apparell, and yeeres very commendable. The inuentor and director
of these pastimes was Thomasso Bambasio, who for such deuises and
action was in Venice esteemed, as in old time Roscius had bene in Rome.
Surely it seemeth strange, that so many men richly attired, and so many
horses brauely furnished, could be managed with so great dexteritie: and
one hauing ended his courses, another was presently ready to supply that
place. In the meane while the Lances did seeme broken, and the splinters
flie about.
                  The duke with al the Nobilitie of the city, beheld this miraculous sight,
and so did a multitude of people.
                  Among these beholders (as mine Author sayth) were diuers Noble
men of England, who trauailed to Venice, purposely to see the maner of this
Triumph, and the Actors.

                  A Triumph in the reigne of King Richard
the second, 1390.
                  
                     THis noble Prince being aduertised, with what magnificence
and pompe, the Queene Isabella of France had made her entry
into Paris, thought good to appoint a militarie triumph
at London, wherin appeared sixty Knights, and so many faire
young Ladies of his Court sumptuously apparelled.
                  With this troope, his Maiestie rode from the Tower of London vnto
Smithfield: and passing thorow Cheapeside a proclamation was made,
that on Sunday and Munday next following, these Knights would attende
there to challenge all commers.
                  For him that deserued best in this Iust (if he were a stranger) the Queene
and her Ladies had prepared a crowne of golde: or if he were any of the
sixty English Knights, he should receiue a rich bracelet.
                  The English Knights likewise promised to giue vnto the stranger of best
desert, a faire horse with his furniture: or if he were an English man, hee
should receiue a Falcon.
                  This challenge and these prizes had bene by a King of Armes formerly
proclaymed in England, Scotland, France, Flaunders, Brabant, Henault, and
Germany: which mooued many persons of Honour and reputation to come
hither. Among whom was William of Henault Earle of Oye or (as some did
call him) of Ostrenant, a young Prince much delighting in Armes.
                  This Noble youth desirous to honour the King of England his kinsman,
drew into his company many Gentlemen of his Nation, with whom hee
passed into England.
                  
                  Then resoluing to performe that iourney, thought good to take the consent
of Albert his father, Count of Henault, Holland, and Zeland. Of whom
with great difficultie he obtained leaue.
                  The like desire to honour the King, mooued the Earle of S. Paul, who
had married the Kings sister. And he brought with him a great troope of
gallant Knights.
                  These two Princes came first vnto Calis, where they found English
ships readie to transport them. But the Earle of Oye passed ouer first: and
being come to London had accesse to the King: of whom he was with
great ioy embraced. The like courtesie he found in Iohn Holland the Kings
brother, and all other Lords of the Court.
                  The day of triumph being come, the King and the Queene attended
vpon by the troopes of men at Armes and Ladies aforesaid passed through
London from the Tower to Smithfield.
                  Being come thither, the King, the Queene, the Ladies, and other honourable

personages, setled themselues in such places as were prepared,
and sorted with their degrees.
                  Then were the men of Armes marshalled, and set in such order, as they
should runne.
                  The first courses were allotted to the Earle of S. Paul and his Band: who
were with great courage encountred by the English. Betweene them the
first dayes Iusting was spent: and that night his Maiestie, the Queene and
all the company supped and lodged in the Bishops house, neere to Saint
Pauls Church.
                  The chiefe honour and commendation of that first fight, was (among
the strangers) giuen vnto the Earle of S. Paul: and among the English the
Earle of Huntington had the praise.
                  This magnificent supper ended, euery one resorted to his lodging (the
King and Queene onely excepted) who continued their lodging in that
house all the time of that triumph.
                  The next day, after noone, King Richard himselfe in compleat Armour
appeared in the fielde, being followed with the whole band of English
Knights.
                  Thither also came the Queene with her traine of Ladies, and was set
in that roome, where the day before she had bene placed.
                  The first (of the strangers) that offered to runne, was the Earle of Oye:
who presented himselfe, and his companie most pompously furnished.
And after him followed the Earle of S. Paul, with his troope of Frenchmen.
                  The Knights strangers, being entred and readie, were foorthwith incountred
by the English. The conflict continued till darke night, with
equall honour.
                  The Iusts of that day ended, the King returned to his lodging, accompanied
with the Noble strangers, and there supped.
                  The chiefe commendation of that day (on the strangers part) was allotted
to the Earle of Oye, who by his vertue, without fauour, so deserued.
                  Likewise among the English, a Gentleman named Hewe Spencer was
highly praysed.
                  On Tuesday also, the men at Armes resorted to the Tilt, and continued
the exercise, with great admiration of the beholders.
                  On Wednesday the runners intermingled themselues, and euery one
did runne as he thought good.
                  On Thursday the King conuited all the men: and all the women supped
with the Queene.
                  On Friday the whole company was feasted by the Duke of Lancaster.
                  
                  On Saturday the King and the Queene, accompanied with the Earles
of Oye and S. Paul (in great state) rode to Windsor: where they were most
honourably intertayned: and the Earle of Oye receiued the Garter. From
thence euery one returned home.

                  The triumphall passage of Charles the
fift Emperour, through France.
Anno 1540.
                  
                     IN the moneth of December this Emperour arriued at
Bayon, where the Dolphin, and Duke of Auuernia with
great pompe receiued him. Being in the towne, he behaued
himselfe as King, pardoning offenders, and deluering
them from prison. From thence with like Maiestie he passed
to other cities, accompanied with the sayd Dolphin and Duke, where
he vsed the same authority.
                  In Ianuary hee came to Castelloaldum, where the King in person with
much magnificence intertained him. From thence he passed to Amboyse,
where King Charles the 8. had built two great towers, the walles whereof
are so large, as Mules and Carts may passe vpon them.
                  The King then to the end that Caesars entrie in the night should bee the
more magnificent, furnished those towers with an exceeding great number
of lights, so as they might behold all the Countrey, as if it had bene
faire day. But when Caesar was going vp, by great mishap, the tower fell on
fire; the flame and smoke whereof became so great, as euery one feared
lest the Emperour should haue bene smothered. Whereupon all men
there present laboured by fleeing to saue themselues. Some that were suspected
to haue done this fact were apprehended, and the King did command
they should be hanged, though indeed no proofe appeared: but
Caesar would in no wise they should die, so were they pardoned.
                  After this disaster, the King conducted the Emperar to Bleas, and from
thence to Fountainableu, where they hunted, hauked, and beheld certaine
Iusts and Tournaments; in conclusion, no sport or solace was omitted.
                  From thence the Emperour attended by the Dolphin and Duke, went
to Paris. Before he entred the citie, the Burgesses and Citizens of all sorts,
came foorth, and receiued him with no lesse ceremony then if the King
had bene present: there he also set at libertie all prisoners. From thence
he passed vnto the Constables house, and was there most honourably lodged.
At last he went into Picardy, and so to Valentia, which is the first town
of his iurisdiction in Belgica: vnto which place the Dolphin and Duke did
follow him.

                  The triumphall Entry of Philip Prince of
Spaine, at Milan. An. 1548.
                  
                     THis Prince entred at the gate towards Pauia: where the citizens
had made a stately bridge, whereupon they shewed
diuers Pageants & Arkes triumphal, adorned with verses,
and sentences very markable. About three of the clocke
after noone, he entred the citie, where the most reputed citizens
did attend him in Burgo della Trinitá, as they call it.
                  Being passed that place, hee was saluted by Caesar Gonzaga, the Count
Iohn Treuultio, the Count Charles Belgioso, and many other noble persons
richly apparelled.
                  After them Mutio Sforza presented his reuerence, being accompanied
with a great troupe of Gentlemen of the Countrey, clad in white silke, and
bearing in their hands Pollaxes: the heads of them were gilt, and the staues
couered with white silke.
                  Then followed the Doctors, & schollers, accompanied with 300 horsemen
apparelled in yellow coats. And immediatly appeared two other
troupes of men lightly armed, which company garded the ancient Lords
and Noblemen of the countrey: among whom were some Princes, Earles
and Barons. That troupe was so great, as two houres sufficed not to see
them passe.
                  They that rode next vnto the Princes person, were the Duke of Alba,
the Duke of Sossa, the Marquesse of Pescara, the Admiral of Castilia, the
Marquesse Milo, Ferdinando Gonzaga.
                  
                  On the one side of the Prince the Cardinal of Trent, on the other the
Duke of Sauoy did ride. Behind them followed fiue companies of men at
Armes, apparelled in siluer and gold, conducted by Count Alexander Gonzaga,
Count Francisco Somaia, Count Philippo Tornello, & two other noblemen.
                  I omit to tell of diuers shewes, Arkes triumphal, and other sights wherwith
in euery streete the Prince was entertained, by Italians onely.
                  These Complements ended, the Prince came vnto the chiefe Church:
at the doore whereof were excellent Paintries.
                  The Prince in his entire to the Church, was by the Senate and people
of Milan presented with a basin of gold ful of double Duckats, to the number
of ten thousand (as was reported)
                  The Prince thus entertained, and setled in the citie, Iusts and Tournaments
were brought before him.
                  The Actors in that triumph were apparelled in silke of diuers colours,
garnished with gold. The first of them did come vnknowen clad in white,
supposed to be the Prince himselfe.

                  ¶A Militarie challenge in Italy 1555.
                  
                     AT such time as the French king with his armie remained at
Ast, the Emperiall campe not being farre from thence, certaine
French Lords challenged the like number of Italians
to breake sharpe Lances for their mistresse loue: in which
action they would hazard both honour and life. The Emperiall
Lords accepted the challenge.
                  
                     
Thus the match was concluded: yet the French fearing some subtiltie
(because the countrey fauoured the enemy) procured Monsieur de Thermes
with fiue hundred horse and 200. footemen to lye neere the place, to
the end he might defend his friends, if need should require.
                  The first courses were performed betweene the Duke de Nemours and
the Marquesse of Pescara, who hauing ended their courses with honor, they
embraced one the other, and so gaue place.
                  The next that presented himselfe, was Monsieur de Classis sonne and heire
of Monsieur de Vasey, a Knight of the Order and Captaine of fifty men at
Armes: against whome came the Marquesse Malespina, who in that encounter
was sore hurt and dyed.
                  The third courses were betweene Monsieur de Mauns a Leader in the
French Army, and a Spanish captaine called Alba. In which reencounter
the Frenchman was wounded in the necke, and the fourth day after died.
                  The last was betweene Monsieur Monshany, and the Earle Caraffa a Neapolitan,
whose encounter was so violent, as with his Lance he pearced thorow
the Armour and body of the Frenchman, so farre, as an Ell thereof
was seene at his backe, whereof hee presently dyed. So was both parties
partakers of misaduenture.
               
               
                  CHAP. 33.
                  Of Triumphant chalenges in France.
                  
                     NOw to th' end it may appeare, that our Gentlemen of England
haue bene no lesse desirous to honour their Nation in
forraine countreys, then willing to aduance the renowne of
their Prince at home: it shall not be (as I thinke) offensiue
to remember some triumphal actions by them performed
in forraine countreys, as writers haue well obserued: wishing our English
Armorists and Historians, were of like care to conserue al memorable actions,
tending to the honour of their owne Prince and countrey. Of which
acts it seemeth there are many worthy to be remembred. For when the
Duke of Buckingham, or (as mine Author calleth him) the Erle of Buckingham,
remained gouernour of the Kings Armie in Bullonoys, a certaine
Frenchman approching the Campe, with a lowd voice asked if any Gentleman
there had a mistresse, or other beloued Lady, for whose sake and
honour, he would breake three Launces, and aduenture three encounters
of his sword. This proud Challenge being heard by the English men, one
Ioachimus Cathorius (as the Author calleth him) a braue English Gentleman
stepped forth: which the Lord Fitzwater (then Marshall,) seeing hee
foorthwith sent word vnto the Frenchman (whose name was Gauuenus Micelleus)
that he should be presently answered. Whereof the French Gentleman
very glad, returned to his friends, & furnished with three Launces,
three Maces of yron, three Swords, and three seruants to beare them, presented

himselfe before the English Armie. The English seeing him in
this sort prepared to maintaine the challenge, much marueiled thereat,
supposing that no Frenchman had dared to encounter the force of an
English Souldier.
                  The brute of this brauado foorthwith was dispersed through the Armie,
and at last the Generall became thereof enformed, who desirous to behold
the combat, mounted on horsebacke, accompanied with the Earle of Stafford,
and the Earle or L of Deuonshire.
                  The Duke and other beholders thus assembled, the Challenger and Defender
begun their courses: but by default of the horses, their Launces
missed at the first, and at the next incounter very lightly th' one touched
the others Armor.
                  The Duke beholding in what estate the matter stood, and perceiuing
night at hand, commanded the conflict should cease til an other day: and
in the meane space required the Frenchman might be well entreated.
                  The next day of triall being come, th' one and th' other appeared, and
with much commendation brake their Launces. That done, they came to
the sword, th' one assaulting th' other furiously, till they were both hurt;
which the Duke perceiuing, caused them to be parted, and the Frenchman
by an Herault was safely sent home to his friends.

                  Of one other like Militarie action betweene
fiue English Gentlemen, and
fiue French.
                  
                     ABout the same time, and in presence of the said Duke of
Buckingham, one other conflict on horsebacke was performed
betweene fiue French Gentlemen, and the like number
of ours, who gained the chiefe honour.
                  I dare not (for feare of mistaking) set downe their names
in English, but thus I finde them in Latine: On the French party was Nothus
Clarus a Pimontesse, Tristamus Iailleus, Ioannes Castelmorantius, Galleus
Aunoeus, Dom, Hoyauius Ameus.
                  
                  The Englishmen were Edwardus Bellicampus the son of Roger, Iohannes
Ambreticortius, Ionaquinus Clitonius, Gulielmus Clitonius, and Gulielmus
Francus.

                  Of one other like Action.
                  
                     IT happened that certaine English Gentlemen hauing serued
in the warre of France, determined to returne home,
and obtained license of the Constable that so they might
doe. Their names do seeme to be Iohn Fitzwarren, William
Clinton, Iohn Burley, and Nicholas Clifford. They being vpon
their way, one (whom mine Author calleth Ioannes Boucmelius a French
Gentleman) did ouertake them: and hauing before that time spoken with
Nicholas Clifford touching matter of Honour and Armes, asked him whether
he could, before he departed, consent to make triall of his vertue, by
breaking of three Launces. With all my heart (quoth Clifford) for so haue
I long desired to do: and no time more fit then now, when the Constable
and his company may be iudge; Yet such is my hap, as I haue no Armor
at hand. For supply of that want (quoth Boucmelius) I will take order that
two Armors shalbe brought vnto vs, and of them the choise shalbe yours,
with euery other thing fit for our purpose.
                  This agreement made, they imparted the same vnto the Constable, and
obtained his license: yet with condition, that they should attend vpon him
the next day, at which time hee would, with other noble men, see what
should be the euent of that Action.
                  About the houre appointed these Champions did appeare, and at the
first course Clifford with his Launce pearced through the Armor and body
of Boucmelius, of which hurt he presently died.
                  This accident much grieued the French, and Clifford himselfe was not a
little sory: which the Constable perceiuing, said vnto Clifford, Be not dismayed,
for this is the fruite of like aduentures: and if my selfe had beene
in thy place, I should haue done the same: for better euer it is to doe, then
suffer at the hand of an enemy.
                  The Constable hauing ended his speech, conuited Clifford with his
company to dinner: and then caused them to be conducted to the next
towne in safety.

                  ¶An other Challenge of a French Gentleman in Spaine.
                  
                     IN the Army of the King of Castile, there was a French Gentleman,
young of yeeres, and in Armes of great reputation:
men called him Tristram de Roy. He seeing the warres ended
betweene the Kings of Castile and Portugal, determined to

returne home. Yet desirous by some means to gaine honor, before his arriuall
in France, procured an Herauld to goe vnto the English Army, and
proclaime, That if any Gentleman there would breake three Launces, he
would challenge him.
                  This challenge being heard in the English campe, a braue young Gentleman
named Miles Windesor accepted thereof: hoping by that occasion
to merit the honour of Knighthood.
                  The next day according to appointment, he appeared in the field, accompanied
with Mathew Gorney, William Beuchamp, Tho Simons, the L. Shandos,
the L. Newcastle, the L. Bardolf, and many others.
                  The French Challenger appeared likewise honourably graced with
friends: and thus both parties in readinesse to runne, the Lord Souldichius
bestowed the dignitie of Knighthood vpon the said Windsor. Which done,
the one charged the other: and the two first courses were perfourmed with
great courage, yet without any hurt. But in the third course the armour
both of the one and the other was pearced through; yet by breach of the
launces, both of them escaped more harme.
               
               
                  CHAP. 37.
                  One other notable Challenge in France,
Anno 1390.
                  
                     IN the reigne of King Charles the sixth, three noble young
men of great hope and much affecting the warre liued in
that Court. viz. Mounsier de Bouciquant the younger, Mounsier
Reynaut de Roye, and Mounsier de S. Pye, all Gentlemen of
that Kings chamber.
                  In the same time also there was in England a Knight for valour and militarie
vertue of great fame: men called him Sir Peter Courtney: He hauing
obtained license, passed the sea, and trauelled to Paris. After a few daies
rest in that citie, he challenged Mounsieur Trimoulie, a noble Gentleman
in great reputation: who accepting the defie, obtained license to answere,
appointing a day and place. The time being come, the King accompanied
with the Duke of Burgundy, and many other great Estates went to behold
that conflict.
                  The first course was performed exceeding well, and ether partie brake
his launce with commendation. But the second launce being deliuered
into their hands, the King inhibited more should be done: seeming somewhat
offended with the English Knight who had made sute, that he might
be suffered to doe his vttermost.
                  This Action by the Kings commaundement was stayed, and Sir Peter
Courtney therewith grieued, thought good to abandon that Countrey, and
so desired he might doe.
                  
                     
The King well pleased he should depart, sent vnto him an honourable
gift, and the Duke of Burgundie did the like. The King also commaunded
Mounsiuer de Clary (a grea
                        •
                      Lord) to accompany him to Callis.
                  
                  By the way, they visited the Earle of S. Paul, who married King Richards
sister of England.
                  
                  The Earle in most courteous manner welcommed Sir Peter, and the
rather, for that his Ladie had formerly bene married to the Lord Courtney
his kinsman, who died young.
                  This Sir Peter Courtney being well entertained, the Earle and hee with
their company supped together: in which time (as the custome is) they
communed of many matters. Among which the Earle asked of Sir Peter,
how he liked the Realme of France, and what conceit he had of the Nobilitie.
                  Whereunto Sir Peter with a sowre countenance answered, That hee
found in France nothing to be compared with the magnificence of England:
though for friendly entertainment hee had no cause to complaine:
yet saide Sir Peter, I am not well satisfied in that matter, which was the
chiefe cause of my comming into France. For I protest in the presence of
all this Honourable company, that if Monsieur de Clary, beeing a Noble
Gentleman of France, had come into England, and challenged any of our
Nation, he should haue beene fully answered: but other measure hath ben
offered to me in France: for when Monsieur de Tremoulie and I had engaged
our honour, after one Lance broken, the king commanded me to stay.
I haue therefore sayde, and wheresoeuer I shall become, will say, that in
France I was denyed reason and leaue to doe my vttermost.
                  These words much moued Mounsieur de Clary, yet (for the present) hee
suppressed his anger, hauing charge to conduct Sir Peter safely vnto Calis.
Notwithstanding this heate (quoth the Earle) let mee tell you Sir Peter,
that in mine opinion you depart from France with much honour, because
the King vouchsafed to entreate you, that the fight might stay: whom to obey,
is a certaine signe of wisedome and praise worthy. I pray you therefore
Sir Knight, haue patience, and let vs proceede in our iourney.
                  Thus Sir Peter hauing taken leaue of the Earle, passed forth towards
Calice, accompanied with Mounsieur de Clary; who so soone as they were
entred into the confines of the English Dominion, Sir Peter most heartily
thanked him for his company and courtesie. But Clary hauing made an
impression of such sowre speeches, as Sir Peter had vttered in the Earles
house, said thus: Hauing now fully performed the Kings commandement
conducting you safe to your friendes, I must, before wee part, put you in
minde of your inconsiderate words in contempt of the Nobility of France.
And to the end you being arriued in England, shall haue no cause or colour
to boast that you were not answered in France: Loe here I my selfe
(though inferiour to many others) am this day, or to morow ready to encounter

                        •
                     ou; not for malice to your person, or gloriously to boast of my
valour, but for conseruation of the fame and honor due to our French nation;
where neuer wanted Gentlemen to answere in Armes, when any
English man should challenge.
                  
                     
Well (quoth Sir Peter) you say well; and with good will I accept your
challenge: and to morow I will not faile to attend you armed, with three
Launces, according to the custome of France.
                  
                  This agreement being made, Sir Peter went foorthwith to Calice, there
to furnish himselfe of Armes fit for the Combat. And making the Lord
Iohn Warren (then Gouernour) priuie to what was intended, the next day
hee returned to meete Mounsieur de Clary betweene Bullaine and Calice:
thither also went the Gouernor, and other English Gentlemen to behold.
                  The courses betweene these Champions being begun: at the first encounter
either partie brake well: but in the second encounter by default
of the English Knights Armour, he was hurt in the shoulder, as other English
Gentlemen did well see: which moued the Gouernour of Calice to say
vnto Mounsieur de Clary, You haue dealt discourteously, to hurt Courtney
when his Armour was broken.
                  I am sory (quoth Clary) but in my power it is not to gouerne Fortune:
what is happened to him, might likewise haue come to me.
                  The matter standing in these termes, Mounsieur de Clary returned into
France, supposing he had deserued great commendation. But being come
to the Court, the King, the Duke of Burgundy and Trymoulie himselfe blamed
him: and the Counsel of France gaue sentence that his goods should
be confiscate, because the King hauing commanded that Sir Peter should
be without offence peaceably conducted to Calice, the matter was otherwise
handled. To be short, Clary was brought to the Kings presence, and
by the Counsel asked what reason he had to take Armes against amy man
whom the king expresly had commanded to defend.
                  These words much perplexed Clary, and the kings offence did greatly
amaze him. Notwithstanding with a good courage he sayd, that what was
enioyned him to doe, he had most faithfully performed: But Courtney with
insolent speech taxed him and all the French nation; which without dishonor
might not be endured: He therfore thought not only to haue bene
free from blame, but also merit commendation. yet (quoth he) seeing my
expectation faileth me, I submit my selfe to the censure of the Constable
and Marshals of France. I also will endure the iudgement of Courtney himselfe
and all other men of Armes in the kingdomes of France and England.
All which excuses & submissions notwithstanding, he was committed to
prison and his goods confiscate, til at the humble and earnest suit of Mounsieur
de Coucy, the Duke of Burbon, the Earle of S. Paul, and the Englishman
(to whom he had done wrong) hee was restored to liberty. Then said the
Constable, Doest thou thinke (Mounsieur de Clary) to haue done well or honoured
the French nation by taking Armes against Courtney, who was recommended
vnto thee? If ought hath bene by Courtney spoken in preiudice
of the French Nobility, thou ought haue complained thereof to the
king, and then haue proceeded by his Maiesties direction. But the matter
was not so handled by thee, which is cause of thy punishmēt. From henceforth
therfore be more aduised, & for thy liberty giue thanks vnto the duke
of Burbon, Mounsieur de Coucy, & the Earle S. Paul, who haue exceedingly entreated
to compasse this fauor. Such was the end of this military Action.
               
               
                  
                  CHAP. 38.
                  ¶One other most noble Challenge.
                  
                     THe strange euent of the former conflict betweene Courtney,
Trimolie, and Clary, mooued the Ladies of the French
Court to incite Bouciquant, Roy, and S. Pie, to attempt some
new feates of Armes vpon the confines of the King of Englands
possessions in Picardy.
                  
                  This generous motion proceeding from the Ladies, was easily apprehended
by the French Lordes and Gentlemen; and chiefly those three aforesaid,
beeing (of all others) most desirous of same and military glory.
The King being made priuie to this intention, commanded those three
Gentlemen to frame a forme of Challenge in writing, which should be allowed
or reformed, as to his Maiestie should be thought good: which was
done accordingly, containing this in effect.
                  
                     
                        THe great desire wee haue to know the noble Gentlemen inhabiting neere the
kingdome of France, and therewith longing to make triall of their valour in
Armes, haue mooued vs to appeare at Ingueluert the 20. of May next, and there
to remaine 30. dayes. We also determine to be accompanyed with other noble Gentlemen
louers of Armes and Honour, there to encounter all commers with Lances
either sharpe, blunt, or both: and euery man shalbe permitted to run fiue courses.
                        We likewise hereby giue you to vnderstand, that such order is taken, as euery
one of vs shall haue his shield, and Empreaze hanging on the outside of the Pauilion:
to th' end if any of you desire to runne, then the day before you may with a wandor
such a Launce as you intend to run with, touch the shield. And who so meanetb
to try his fortume both with blunt and sharpe, must touch the shield with either,
and signifie his name to him that hath our said shields in keeping.
                        It is moreouer ordered, that euery Defendor may bring with him one other
Gentleman in lieu of a Padrin, to encounter vs both, or single, as it shall please them.
Wherewith we pray and desire all noble and worthy Gentlemen (of what Nation
soeuer) to beleeue, that no pride or malice hath moued vs to this enterprize, but rather
an earnest desire to see and know all such noble Gentlemen, as are willing to
make proofe of their vertue and valor, without fraud or couin. In witnesse whereof
euery one of vs haue signed these Letters with our seales and Empreaze. Written
and dated at Montepessolane the 20. of Nouember 1389.
                        
                           Subscribed. Bouçequaut. Roy. S. Pye.
                        
                     
                  
                  THese Letters shewed to the King, were imparted to his Counsell: who
considering their tenor, deemed them to be presumptuous (chiefly in
respect the place appointed was neere vnto Calis: which haply might call
into question the truce taken for three yeeres.) Whereupon some of the
most ancient Counsellors, thought it vnmeete to permit the Challenge.

But others perceiuing the Kings inclination, did allow thereof, because the
words of challenge, were modest and reasonable.
                  The matter thus debated in Counsel, the King called into his chamber
all the three Challengers, to whom he said thus, Bouciquaut, Roy, and you
S. Pye, behaue your selues well, and with respect both to priuate and publique
comelinesse, performe what you haue in hand. As for charge, spare
not, for of our bountie we wil bestow vpon you ten thousand Florins, to be
discreetly spent to your owne honour. Then after most humble thankes
giuen vnto his Maiestie, they determined to send the proclamation of their
Challenge into diuers countries, but chiefly into England.
                  The proclamation being in al places published, euery courageous Lord
and Gentleman put himselfe in readinesse: and first of all the English, being
perswaded, that in respect they were neerest, it behooued them to appeare
soonest. Therefore before all others, these Englishmen determined
to make proofe of their fortune.

                        Iohn Holland.
                        The Earle of Huntingdon.
                        
                        Iohn Courtney.
                        Iohn Goulonfee.
                        Iohn Russell.
                        Thomas Scrope.
                        William Clifton.
                        William Clinton.
                        William Tailboys.
                        Godfrey Seten.
                        William Hacklet.
                        Iohn Dabridgcourt.
                        
                           Henry Bewmount and others, to the
number of one hundreth or more,
                     
went into France to shew their vertue in that Challenge. Besides them also
many others did passe the seas, to see what should be done.
                  The first Englishman that passed the Sea, was Iohn Holland brother to
the King of England, hauing in his traine Noblemen and Gentlemen of
note, about 60. who were all lodged within the towne of Calis.
                  
                  The Challengers then hauing prepared themselues, arriued at Bullaine,
in the beginning of May, and were lodged in the Abbey where they were
enformed of the excellent furniture which the English had brought;
Whereat they reioyced and made the more hast to their businesse. Then
they caused there greene Pauilions to be set vp, betweene Calis and Bullen.
                  
                  At the doore of euery Pauilion, a shield was hanged, which any man
(desirous to fight) might at his pleasure touch.
                  
                     The order of this Triumph was thus.
                     THe twenty and one day of May, the Challengers appeared at the place
ready armed and mounted.
                     Shortly after the English men came from Callis, some to try their fortune,
and other to behold.
                     First of al Iohn Holland with his Lance touched the Shield of Bouciquaut,
and foorthwith he came out of his Pauilion, and mounted on horsebacke.
which done, th'one charged the other, without more hurt, then that the
English Lords shield was pearced through.
                     The second course was also without harme: And the English man preparing
for a third course, Bouciquaut denied to do more that day; which the
English Lord hearing, turned himselfe to the shield of S. Pye & touched it.
                     
                        
Then presently he came forth couragiously, but the first course proued
foule, for that the horses kept not their right path. Notwithstanding Holland
disarmed the head of S. Pye.
                     
                     The second course was performed better, and the launce both of the
one and the other broken vpon the Shields.
                     At the third course, both their Headpieces were striken off, and all the
lookers on might see their faces. Neuerthelesse the Lord Holland desired
that for his mistresse sake he might breake one Launce more. Which couragious
offer both French and English commended.
                     Next to these, Roy and the English man called Earle Marshall charged
one the other, with much commendation.
                     The third courses were performed by Bouciquaut and the Lord Clifford,
cousin to the Lord Shandois, a man expert in Armes and of great fame.
                     The fourth English man that ranne, was Henry Bewmount, a Knight of
good reputation.
                     The seuenth encounter was betweene S. Pye and the same Bewmount.
                     
                     The eight encounter was betweene Roy and Peter Courtney.
                     
                     The ninth encounter was betweene Bouciquaut and Courtney.
                     
                     The tenth betweene S. Pye and Courtney, who had touched all their
shieldes.
                     The next encounter was allotted to Goulowfer and Roy.
                     
                     The next courses were betweene S. Pye and Iohn Russell.
                     
                     The next was betweene Bouciquaut and Peter Scrope, a young Gentleman
of great courage, but of no long practise in Armes: yet was his encounter
so violent, as forced Bouciquaut to bleede at the eares, and retire to his pauilion
all that day.
                     But Scrope not contented with the honour of his successe against Bouciquaut
touched the shield of S. Pye and presently the one encountred the other.
But at the second course (by misfortune) the English Knight fell
downe, and though (with some helpe) he recouered his horse, yet ranne
he no more that day. Such was the successe of the first dayes Iusting.
                  
                  
                     The second meeting.
                     THe second day Gulielmus Clysetonius, an English Knight, expert in
Armes, encountred Bouciquaut, with equall fortune.
The next encounter was betweene the L. Clinetonius and S. Pye, either
of them performing his part well.
                     The third encounter was betweene William Stamartius cousin to the
Earle of Huntingdon, and Raynol Roy, who seemed to deserue best.
                     The 4. encounter was betweene Lancaster and Bouciquaut with small aduantage.
                     The 5. encounter was betweene S. Pye and Taylbois a Gentleman very
yong. Either of them was disarmed on the head, and so returned to their
Pauilions.
                     The 6. encounter was betweene Godfrey Seten and Roy: at the first course
Launces being strong, their horses were forced to pauze. At the second
(for the same reason) th'one and th'other let fall their Launces, without

breaking. At their third course th'one and th'other was hurt: so as Roy was
sore bruzed, and Seten pearced into the shoulder. Which wound he endured
with great patience, & without shew of griefe, suff
                           •
                        ed the Chirurgeon
to draw backe the Launce, and search the wound, which courage was highly
praised.
                     The 7. encounter was betweene an English man called Blanquetius and
S. Pye.
                     
                     The 8. encounter was betweene Thomalinus Messidonius and Bouciquaut.
This English man was richly armed, & at the first course pearced through
the shield of Bouciquaut: But at the third course he was vnhorsed.
                     The 9. encounter was betweene Nauartonius and Bouciquaut with equal
fortune.
                     The 10 encounter was betweene Sequaquetonius an English Knight and
Roy. This Knight was of experience in Armes, and at the first course wel-neere
vnhorsed his aduersary. But at the last meeting the French Taint was
so strong, as the Englishman was wel-neere borne downe: and so they departed.
Thus ended the second dayes Triumph.
                     ¶Note here that the French King (being disguised) was present at all
these exercises.
                  
                  
                     The third meeting.
                     THe third day likewise these noble Knights both English and French
appeared. The weather was faire, calme, and fit for Military action.
The first courses were performed betweene Iohn Sauage and Roy: who at
the first encountred so furiously, as both th'one & th'other was almost forced
to fall from his horse. The rest of their courses were honourable.
                     The second encounter was betweene Gulielmus Basqueneus cosin to the
Earle Marshall, and Bouciquaut. At the third course they were both disarmed
on the head.
                     The third encounter was betweene an English Knight called Scot, and
S. Pye. Their first course was faire on both sides, and so was the second. But
at the third course the French Knight lost his headpeece, and the English
Knight vnhorsed.
                     The fourth encounter was betweene Barnard Stapleton, and s. Pye, and
either of them at the third course lost his headpeece.
                     The fifth encounter was betweene Iohn Arundel and Roy. This English
Knight was reputed for horsemanship, dancing, and singing, excellent.
The one and the other of them perfourmed their courses with commendation.
                     The sixth encounter was betweene Nicolas Stoner and Bouciquaut, who
in their third course lost both their headpeeces, and so bare headed, went
away.
                     The seuenth encounter was between Iohn Marshal and Bouciquaut, who
was somewhat hurt with a splitter, & the other disarmed of his headpiece.
                     The eighth encounter was betweene Iohn Clifton and Roy, with equall
fortune.
                     The ninth encounter was betweene Roger Lea and S. Pye, either of them
being disarmed on the head, departed.
                     
                        
The tenth encounter was betweene Aubrigcourt and Roy. This Aubrigcourt
was not borne in England, but brought vp in the Court of the most
noble King Edward. At their first course they were both violently stricken
on the head, and in the next on the breast, and so they parted. But Aubrigcourt
not so contented, challenged Bouciquaut: who answered him two
courses with equall fortune, and the third course they were both disarmed
on the head. Such was the successe of the third dayes meeting.
                  
                  
                     The fourth meeting.
                     ON Thursday (which was the last) these noble Knights returned to the
field, where Godfrey Eustace made the first encounter against Bouciquaut,
and were both hurt on the head.
                     The next encounter was betweene Alanus Burgius and S. Pye, with being
both disarmed on the head.
                     The next encounter was betweene Iohannes Storpius and Bouciquaut, in
which courses the English mans horse was said to fall downe.
                     The next encounter was betweene Bouciquaut and an English Knight
called Hercourt, belonging to the Queene of England, but not borne in
England. At the first course Bouciquaut missed, and the English Knight
brake crosse, which is an errour in Armes: and thereupon much disputation
arose betweene the French and English. For the French affirmed,
that Hercourt by law of Armes, had forfeited his Horse and Armes: but at
request of the company, that fault was remitted, and he permitted to runne
one course more against Roy, who had not runne that day, and therefore
willingly consented. The courses betweene these Knights were exceeding
violent, but the Englishman being wearied was vtterly throwen from his
horse, and as a dead man lay flat on the ground: but afterwards he reuiued
lamenting that disgrace.
                     The fifth encounter was betweene Robert Scrope and S. Pye, who after
three courses gaue ouer, without losse or gaine.
                     The sixth encounter was betweene Iohn Morley and Reginaldus Roy:
for the first blow was so violent, as forced their horses to stand still in the
place of meeting.
                     The seuenth encounter was betweene Iohannes Moutonius and Bouciquaut:
both of them at the first meeting had their shields pearced, and after
were disarmed on the head.
                     The eight encounter was betweene Iaqueminus Stropius and S. Pye. At
the first course both their horses went out. At the second they brake both
on the head. At the third, both their Lances fell from them: and at the last
the Englishman pearced through the Aduersaries shield, but was himselfe
dismounted.
                     The ninth encounter was betweene Guilielmus Masqueleus and Bouciquaut.
These Knights with equall courage and skill perfourmed well their
courses.
                     The last encounter was betweene Nicolas Lea and S. Pye: the one and
the other of them brake their Launces well, till at the last they were both
disarmed on the head.
                     
                        
The Challenge thus ended, all the troupe of English Knights hauing
attended that busines full foure dayes, thanked the French Knights for being
Authours of so honourable a triumph. On the other side the French
much thanked the English for their company: and the King who was
there secretly, returned home, where hee enformed the Queene what honour
had bene done to all Ladies.

                     THese most excellent Princes hauing occasion of conference,
appointed a meeting in Picardie. The day drawing
neere, the king of England passed the seas and arriued at Calice:
from whence (hauing reposed himselfe) he remoued
to Guynes. The French King likewise being come lodged
at Ardes.
                  
                  Betweene the one and the other of those townes (as it were in the midway)
a place of meeting was appointed.
                  Thither went the one and the other of those Kings most royally mounted,
and followed with so great magnificence, as in an hundred yeeres before
the like sight had not bene seene in Christendome.
                  Some writers haue in vaine laboured to set downe the royalty and exceeding
pomp of those Courts, which might be seene, but not expressed.
                  At the place of meeting, two Pauilions were erected, the one for the
French king, the other for the King of England.
                  
                  These Princes being come, embraced one the other: and that done,
they went together into one Pauilion.
                  The French King was accompanied with his Lord Admiral, called Boniuett,
his Chancellor, and some fewe other Counsellors.
                  The King of England had with him the Cardinall of Yorke, the Duke of
Norffolke, and the Duke of Suffolke.
                  
                  Then hauing set in counsel, and returned to their Pauilions, they bethought
them of entertainement, sports and princely Complements.
                  For which purpose, commandement was giuen, that a Tilt should bee
erected: where Iusts, Tournaments and other triumphall exercises, continued
about fifteene dayes: for so long those Princes remained there.
                  One day the King of England conuited the French King, & feasted him
in his Pauilion, which was a building of wood, containing foure roomes,
exceeding large, and so richly furnished, as haply the like had not bene
seene in Christendome.
                  That Frame was purposely made in England, and after the feast, taken
downe to be returned.
                  
                     
One other day the French King feasted the King of England in his Pauilion,
wherein hanged a cloth of Estate marueilous large, and so rich as cannot
be expressed.
                  The ropes belonging to that Pauilion were make of yellowe silke and
gold, wreathed together.
                  The Kings being ready to dine, there happened so great a storme of
wind, as fearing the Pauilion could not stand, they remooued from thence
to the place where the Fortresse is nowe; and beareth the name of that
banquet.
                  The apparell, Iewels and other Ornaments of pompe, vsed by Princes,
Lords & Gentlemen awaiting on those Kings, cannot be esteemed: much
lesse expressed: for, as mine Author sayth, some caried on their backes
the prise of whole woods, others the weight of ten thousand sheepe, and
some the worth of a great Lordship.

                  A Triumph celebrated in France.
Anno 1559.
                  
                     WHen the mariage betweene the King of Spaine and Elizabeth,
eldest daughter of Henry the French King, was concluded:
in signe of congratulation and ioy, a royal Triumph
was proclaimed and prepared at Paris: whereunto the Nobilitie
of all France, Spaine, and the Lowe countreys repaired:
which done, a solemne Iust, and other military sports were taken in
hand, wherein the King in his owne person, the Duke of Ferrara, the Duke
of Gwyze, and the Duke of Nemors were Challengers.
                  The place for performance of that Action was appointed in the streete
of S. Anthony in Paris, and there a Tilt with euery furniture fit for such a
feast, was prepared.
                  To that place (as at like occasions it happeneth) resorted an infinite
number of people to behold: for whom scaffolds and stages were ready to
receiue them; and those places not capable of so excessiue a number, many
of the people bestowed themselues on the sides and roofes of the
houses.
                  The first courses were performed by the French King, to his great glory:
the rest of the Challengers also very honourably did the like. Then
the Lords and Counsellors besought the King that in respect the weather
was exceeding hote, his Maiesty would be pleased to moderate his motion,
and for that day cease from running: adding this perswasion, that it was vnfit
a King should in such disports hazard his person; which perswasion for
the present preuailed. But his Maiesty (as it were drawen on by fatal force)
would in any wise the 3. day returne to the Tilt, either to make further triall

of his valour, or thereby (as some supposed) to honour his daughter, to
the vttermost of his power.
                  That day his Maiestie in all princely pompe appeared: his person and
horse also being more richly furnished then any pen can expresse.
                  The first courses his Maiestie performed fortunately, with marueilous
applause of the beholders.
                  At the fourth course, by marueilous misaduenture, he became hurt with
a splinter of the aduersaries Lance, which pearced his eye so deep, as thereby
his braine was much bruised. Thus was the Nuptiall feast disturbed,
and ioy conuerted to sorow. Such is the state of worldly things, gladnes is
euer followed with sadnes, and pleasure accompanied with paine.
                  The rest of the troupe there ready to runne, were with that accident
marueilously amazed, and not knowing what to doe, euery man let f
                        •
                     ll his
Lance, and cursed all such triumphs.
                  Some preassed to carie his person home, and others (as touched to the
heart) shut vp their eyes from seeing a spectacle so lamentable.
                  The Ladies likewise and Gentlewomen of the Court, turned their faces
from beholding, and closed vp their eyes with teares. To conclude, the
whole number of Courtiers were striken with sorow not explicable.
                  The Citizens likewise, and generally all the subiects of that kingdome,
were perplexed, to see the tragical euent of that disastrous triumph: which
was intended to congratulate a new peace and an honourable alliance.
                  The forme and face of the citie thus conuerted from exceeding ioy, to
vnspeakeable sorow; some helde vp their hands to heauen, others made
haste to the Churches, and euery one with abundance of sighs and sobs,
cried out, beseeching God to grant the King recouery: as if euery mans
well doing had thereon depended.
                  How vnpleasing these newes were to the King of Spaine, euery one can
conceiue.
                  Then the Physicians and Chirurgions, not onely of France, but of the
Low countreys also came thither to shew their skil, vsing all Art and endeuour
that might be: but the splinters of the Lance had pearced the Kings
eye so deepe, as the tendernes of the place could not suffer it to bee taken
out, nor seene, (the braine also being pearced) no meane there was to cure
the wound. The King therefore tormented with extreame paine, fell into
a burning Feuer, whereof in the end of eleuen daies he died In all which
time he did neuer weepe, or speake any word that might be imputed to pusillanimity;
but most magnanimously tooke leaue of life: Onely thus he
sayd, that seeing he was destined to die in Armes, he would haue bene
much better contented, to haue lost his life in the field, then in those domesticall
pastimes. Let this accident therefore remaine an example to all
princes neuer to aduenture their owne persons vnnecessarily, considering
their onely liues is the welfare of infinite others.

                  A Militarie triumph at Brussels, Anno 1549.
                  
                     A Fained fortresse, with Trenches, Baracadoes, and other furniture
of defence was erected. On the roote wherof a sword
of gold was set, adorned with precious stones.
                  This Castell was inuironed with water, like to an Iland:
and impossible it was to mount vnto the walls, but by degrees
and staires exceeding steepe.
                  This yland was called Insula Fortunae, which is the yle of Fortune: others
named it Insula periculosa: the perilous yland.
                  Vpon the water which inuironed the Castell, a ship of gold did alwayes
ride at Anker, with sailes of red silke and gold. Neither was any thing else
wanting to illustrate the beautie thereof.
                  On the first gate was painted a roaring Lion of gold, which picture shined
very gloriously: and neere to it was a posterne gate, the name whereof
was Porta terroris: which is the gate of terror.
                  Betweene the water and the gate was a large Court: and there hanged
a large white Shield, and therein was painted a blacke Eagle.
                  Neere to that place was a Turret, whereinto no man could come, vntill
he had passed many doores: it was called Transitus periculosus, which is, the
perilous passage.
                  Not farre from thence was a Pillar of no great height, yet broad and
square, and thereon was painted a red Griffin, vnder which signe were graued
the Lawes of that yland in three tongues.
                  The first passage to the Castell was kept by the Knight of the red Griffin:
who was indeed the Earle Aringberg.
                  
                  The second passage was kept by the Knight of the blacke Egle: that was
the Erle Hoochstrat.
                  
                  The third passage next the yland, was kept by the Knight of the golden
Lion: which was the Earle of Egmond.
                  
                  Within this Castell, called Arxtenebrosa; remained the L. Corbaron gouernour
to the Prince Aurasina, who had before wonne it by art Magicke:
and now by conuerting the letters of his name backeward, named himselfe
Norabroc.
                  
                  Before euery of the foresaid gates, a magnificent Pauilion was erected,
and therein the Earles with their troupes attended their enemies.
                  Then was there a petition presented to the Emperour, against Norabroc
the Magician, for that hee by his diuelish art and force of the inchanted
sword, had surprised many noble personages and worthy Knights, now
prisoners in the Castell of darknesse.
                  And forsomuch as it hath bene prophesied, that the glorious expugnation
of this Castell is destined onely to the most vertuous and fortunate

Prince liuing vnder the sunne (who can be no other then the excellent
Prince of Spaine) sonne to the most inuincible Emperour Charles) they
humbly desired, that he with his Knights might attempt the enterprise.
                  The Emperours license obtayned, the three Knights within the darke
Castle, came foorth to encounter all those that durst assayle them.
                  The first that appeared, called himselfe the Darke Knight, followed
with one onely seruant to carry his launce. His armour was blacke, and
his apparell course: Of the same colour was the attire of his seruant, and
the furniture of his horse. But the assault no sooner was made, but he retired
into the Castle. Norabroc had euer sixe Gentlemen apparelled in red
and yellow, readie to receiue such Knights as went out or in.
                  Those sixe were attired after the Hungarian fashion, wearing on their
heads Turbants.
                  These men had charge of the bridge, to let in euery Knight that would
fight. This Darke Knight was the Lord Chaumont: and he that encountred
him was the Knight of the red Griffin, otherwise called the Earle of Arenberg.
His armour was all gilded, and ouer it hee ware an arming coate of
siluer cloth, very rich. In his crest he also ware feathers white and vermilion.
                  The Darke Knight thus retired to the Castle, three other Knights appeared
in coates of blacke cloth of gold, and in their crests they ware feathers
of many colours. Before them rode a young man apparelled like to
a woman, after the most anticke fashion.
                  That woman was mounted vpon a fish, and by her a footman did runne.
She complained and bitterly cursed one, by whom she had bene iniured.
                  Then the Knights who accompanied her, promised to be reuenged, and
presently determined to assault the Iland.
                  The first of these three Knights bearing many colours, was Yuan Cunia
the Spaniard: who at the second course, hurt the Earle Arenberg very sore;
and hauing lost the vse of one finger on his right hand, he ran no more. In
his place therefore succeeded, a Knight vnknowen, wearing the signe of
an horne. Then came the Earle Hochstrate in white siluer: wearing on his
breast a rose. And although he perfourmed his part well, yet was he forced
to dismount.
                  The Earle Arenberg beeing wounded, in his place one other of three
knights errant, did come: who was the Lord Hubermunt of the Emperors
Chamber.
                  The third Knight was Peter Ernest Earle Mansfield, calling himselfe
Knight of the white Moyle. Against him came the Knight of the golden
Lyon: vpon whom the Earle Mansfield brake three swords: but the fourth
sword by misaduenture fell out of his hand, and thereby he forced to become
prisoner. And this was the end of that dayes conflict.
                  The next day soone after dinner, out came the Lord Pelous of Burgundy
called the Knight of the greene Shield: hee and his horse were furnished
with gold and greene. The first three encounters he made against the Lord
Thourlo, were to good purpose: but beeing come to the Sword, it was by
force wrested from him, and he caried to prison.
                  
                     
Then followed Rodorigo Bassano a Spaniard, called Pedro Vermandesio,
who within three encounters was taken.
                  The Lo. Courlan a Burgundian, called Knight of the three Starres, all in
greene, desiring to be reuenged, was also made prisoner.
                  The next day Peter Ernestus Earle Mansfield desired againe to try his fortune,
calling himselfe the feathered Knight. But at the second encounter
his aduersaries Launce brake the sight of his headpeece, and cut his nose,
wherewith he fell downe dead: yet because the armour was good and the
violence of the blow broken, he recouered.
                  After Mansfield, followed the L. Noyel a Fleming: who after a little fight
before the tower of Terror, where he fought with great courage, was forced
to yeeld.
                  Then Iacomo di Leyua a Spaniard (called the Indian Knight) attired in
blacke, after the second course yeelded himselfe.
                  Next to the Spaniard entred two Knights in red cloth of Tissue, richly
embrodered with gold: they called themselues Knights of Hungary. The
one was the Prince of Ascoli, who at the first encounter yeelded himselfe:
neither had Giacobo a Cunia (called also Gonartus a Stella tenebrosa) better
fortune: for at the first course he was taken.
                  The first that entred the Iland by force, was Iohn Guixada sirnamed Gulielmus
Superbus: Hee, apparelled in blacke tissue embrodered about with
gold, by force of Armes brake into all the passages; and then by aid of the
Lord Bossuuio master of the Emperours stable, was receiued into a Barke,
hauing sayles of white and red silke. So being landed in the Ile, he attempted
to winne the precious sword. And though his attempt prooued vaine,
yet in approbation of his valour, the Queene did giue him a crowne.
                  Next to him his brother, with equall fortune, entred the Iland: men called
him Iohn Lodouic Guixada, who for his hardy enterprise receiued also a
garland.
                  The like successe had the Duke of Arscot his brother, who with the
Marquesse of Cieura (called Knight of the red Shield, wheron were painted
three Mores heads) entred the Ile. Likewise Ferdinando della Zerda a Spaniard
(called fortunes Knight) hauing slaine the guard, was also crowned.
                  The next day also Monsieur de Chaumont, called the sodaine Knight,
and one other Knight named Florestan which was the Lord Valous, both
Flemings, yeelded their charges.
                  The fift man that entred the Ile, was Lodouico Zapatta a Spaniard: his
garments were of yellow cloth of gold. But Iohn Zeuendio a Spaniard also,
called the sorowfull Knight, was forced in the first straight to alight, & was
presently ledde into the darke fortresse. The like fortune had Monsieur de
Moncean named Knight of the Mistie mountaine.
                  The sixt that entred the Ile was the Earle of Megen, otherwise the Knight
of the Sunne. His apparell was blacke cloth of gold. The like good hap
was like to befall vnto Monsieur Champagni, but his horse encountring an
enemy at the chocke, amazed him so much as he fell downe and was taken
prisoner.
                  The seuenth garland Gaspero Roblesio a Spaniard gained. He being called

Knight of the Moone, recouered the second passage, complaining vnto the
Earle of Egmont, that the Iudges without desert had giuen honor to Monsieur
de Truilier a Frenchman.
                  But Monsieur Querenaut a Knight errant, encountring Monsieur Preux
called Knight of the Rose, tooke him prisoner. Then Garna ab Ayala a Spaniard,
called the Knight of Death, all in blacke poudered white, came
foorth to fight. Before 
                        •
                     im the Queenes Musicians went singing a funerall
tune; which prognosticated his misaduenture: for at the first encounter he
was taken.
                  Then appeared one called Knight of the Bas
                           •
                        lisco, beeing indeed Monsieur
Myngoual, who in a fight on foot gained great honour: but at his first
encounter on horsebacke he became prisoner.
                  The eight garland Monsieur de Mally a Flemish Gentleman, and a follower
of the Duke of Arscot, obtained. That Knight was brauely furnished
in white siluer, and called himselfe the furious Knight.
                  Last of all, the prince of Spaine with his Band of Knights appeared: their
attire was vermilion cloth of gold, wrought with flowers of siluer, and garded
about with lace of gold. The Caparisons of their horses were of the
same. Also the Saddles, the Petrels, Croopers, and Girthes were of vermilion
silke, mixed with gold; so was euery mans scaberd, and all the fauours
in their Creasts were made of white and vermilion red. The chiefe
Knight of the princes company was the Marques of Pescara, sonne to the
Marquesse of Guasta in Italy, who called himselfe Knight Anonius; a beardlesse
yong man, yet so valorous, as in that fight he receiued a crowne.
                  Next to him was the Baron, Noirquerk, a Fleming, called Knight of the
the Rose: a gallant Gentleman, yet at the first encounter taken prisoner.
                  The third was the Marquesse of Monte, Knight of the Skie, because his
Armour was of that colour: Hee passed the Strait, but further hee could
not goe.
                  The fourth was the Prince of Piemount and Duke of Sauoy, whose vertue
merited a garland, but his sword could not gaine more ground, but onely
to enter the Iland.
                  The fift was the Prince of Spaine, who brake his two first Launces with
great courage: and the third was torne with so great violence, as thereof
ten pieces were seen to lie on the ground.
                  These courses furiously perfourmed, he drew forth his sword, and with
marueilous speede pearced further into the Iland: till in the end of three
assaults, he gained the place where the fatall sword was: whereof hauing
layd hold, he flourished ouer his head, and forthwith the misty cloudes
of darkenes vanished: so, as euery man might see all places of the Castel.
                  The darkenes of the fortresse thus driuen away, the Prince with his inchanted
sword touched the wals: and immediatly they fell downe.
                  The castel thus demolished, the Inchanter Norabroc, with a Turkish cap
on his head, came forth: and kneeling on his knees, desired the Princes
pardon. Therewith also he set at libertie all the knights whom he held in
prison, and they being free, in triumphant wise fo
                        •
                     lowed the Prince to his
Court.

                  The inauguration of Carolus Magnus King
of Italy, Anno 773.
                  
                     WHen Desiderio King of the Lombards was taken prisoner,
and the people of Lombardie yeelded to Charles, he proclaimed
himselfe King of all Italy: which title by law of
Armes he iustly claimed to be his. The same was also by
the decree of Pope Gregory confirmed. Then was he also
by the Bishop of Milan crowned at Modena. The crowne
he recei
                        •
                     ed, was of iron: for of that mettall he commanded it should be
made, enioyning all his successors to doe the like.
                  The order and ceremonies of that coronation, remaineth recorded in
the Rota at Rome: and is to this day obserued at the Inauguration of all Emperours,
when they are elected King of Romanes.
                  The morning when this Charles was to be crowned, certaine Bishops
were sent to conduct him from his chamber vnto the Church, and being
come thither he was brought before the high Altar.
                  Then the Archbishop, after he had said certaine prayers, turned himselfe
to the people, and asked them whether they did consent to receiue
that Prince for their King, and whether they determined faithfully to obey
his lawes and commandements.
                  So soone then as the people had pronounced their consent, the Bishop
with holy oyle anointed the Kings head, his breast, and shoulders: therewith
praying God to blesse him, and grant him good successe in Armes,
with an happie succession of children.
                  These Ceremonies being ended, the Archbishop deliuered into the
Kings hand a sword, and ornified him with a bracelet, a ring and a scepter.
Also vpon his head he set the crown aforesaid. All those things being done,
he kissed him (as a signe of peace) and so departed from the King.

much molested that Countrey, and were subdued by Vinigesius
the sonne of Charles then Duke of Spoleto: Leo the Bishop
of Rome in the time of prayers, when all the people
were assembled, the Barons of Rome also present, did consecrate

and anoint Charles, before the Altar Basilica, where he also receiued
the Ensignes of the Empire. From thence he was conducted to the chiefe
Altar of the Temple, and there anointed, when he had raigned in France
33 yeeres: before which time, no Emperour in three hundred and thirtie
yeeres, had bene seene in Italy. This order of coronation hath euer since
bene obserued.
                  At euery such coronation, the people with one voice did cry: Carolo Augusto,
Magno, & Pacifico vita & victoria.

yeeres: yet did they assemble often, but euery one ambitiously affecting
the Papacie for himselfe, nothing could be concluded: for in those dayes
the Cardinals were not shut vp in the conclaue, (as since hath beene the
vse) but euery one went at libertie and at his pleasure.
                  The creation of the Pope thus deferred, Phillip the Frence King, and
Charles king of Sicill came vnto Viterbo, to sollicite the election: yet they
preuailed not.
                  One day, these Kings being present in the Conclaue, the Cardinall of
Porto seeing the frowardnesse of the other Cardinals, who seemed to pray
ayd of the holy Ghost in that action, said vnto them: My Lords, let vs vntile
the roofe of this chamber, for it seemeth the holy Ghost cannot enter, if the
house be still couered. And so soone as he heard that Gregory was pronounced
Pope, he framed these verses of that election, viz.
                  
                     Papatus munus tulit Archidiaconus vnus,
                     Quem patrem patrum fecit discordia fratrum.
                  
                  This Pope before his ascension was called Theobaldus, an Archdeacon,
no Cardinall: being also, at that time, beyond the sea at Ptolemaida in
Syria: whether he was gone with Edward the King of Englands eldest son.
From thence they intended (among other pilgrims) to go vnto Ierusalem.
But hearing he was pronounced Pope, returned from Syria into Italy: and
being come to Viterbo he receiued the Ensignes of Papacie. From thence
he passed to Rome, and was there crowned by the name of Gregory the tenth.
He liued Pope sixe yeeres, sixe moneths, and tenne dayes: and finding

fault with some orders of the Church, chiefly in electing the Pope, he framed
diuers Canons of which these are part.
                  First that the assembly of Cardinals for choise of euery new Pope, should
be at a place fit for the purpose, and where the Pope defunct, with his
Court, did die. But if the death hapened in any village or small towne,
then the next citie to be the place of election.
                  That no election of any new Pope should be, till after ten dayes that the
other Pope departed, to the end the Cardinals absent might appeare.
                  That no Cardinal in his absence should be permitted to haue any suffrage
or voice in the conclaue.
                  That euery Cardinal absent, and euery other person of any condition,
should be capable of the Papacie.
                  That no Cardinal entred into the Conclaue, should goe out, before the
new Pope were created.
                  That no Cardinal or other person should ambitiously endeauour to
compasse the Papacie by money or other corruption, vpon perill of the
Popes curse.

                  ¶The Inauguration of Henry the 4. King
of England 1399.
                  
                     THis King, called before Duke of Lancaster, came first to
Westminster, and from thence he went vnto the Tower of
London, accompanied with the Nobilitie and the rest of
his Court: there he made nine Knights of the Bath, and 46.
other Knights.
                  The next day after dinner, he returned to Westminster in great pompe:
he himselfe riding through London, kept his head bare: and about his neck
he ware the collar appertaining to the Order of Fraunce.
                  Before the King, went the Prince his sonne, sixe Dukes, sixe Earles, and
eighteene Barons, besides other Lordes, Knights, Esquiers, and Gentlemen
to the number of 900. or thereabout.
                  By the way awaited the Lord Mayor with his brethren, and officers of
the City. Also the companies of euery Hall in their Liueries, which number
amounted to sixe hundred.
                  All the streets where the King passed, were hanged with cloth of golde,
siluer, or rich Arras.
                  That day and the next, all the conduits were full of wine, some Claret,
and some White.
                  The night before the Coronation, the King washed his body: and the
next morning prayed, in the presence of three Prelats.
                  The next morning, the Clergie in great numbers attended the King to

the Temple of Westminster: and from thence all the Lords and Knights
of the Order in their robes awaited vpon his Maiestie to the Pallace, who
all that way marched vnder the Canopy of State.
                  On either hand of the King a sword was caried: the one represented the
Ecclesiasticall, the other Politicall iurisdiction.
                  The Ecclesiasticall sword was borne by the Prince of Wales the Kings
sonne: the sword of Iustice, Henry Percie Earle of Northumberland and
Constable of England, did beare: which office was lately taken from the
Earle of Rutland and giuen to him. The scepter was caried by the Earle of
Westmerland Marshall of England.
                  In this order, and thus accompanied, the King came into the Church,
where he found a place of State prepared in the mids: there he set himselfe
downe, being furnished with all his rich and royall ornaments, the crowne
excepted.
                  The Archbishop of Canterbury preached, and shewed the Kings person
vnto the people, saying, Behold him here that is to raigne ouer you, for
so God hath ordained: Will you (quoth hee) consent he shall be crowned
your King? whereunto they answered, Yea: and holding vp their hands,
offered to be sworne.
                  Then the King went downe from his seate, and kneeled before the high
Altar, where two Archbishops and ten Bishops did take off his royall garments,
and annoynt him in the presence of all the multitude: viz. on the
crowne of his head, on the breast, on the shoulders, on the palmes of his
hands: which done, they set his cap vpon his head.
                  Then the King put vpon him a garment like vnto a Deacon, and girt
the same, as Prelates vse to doe. Then they buckled vpon one of his feete a
Spurre, and drew forth the sword of Iustice, which they deliuered into the
Kings hand, and he put it vp into the sheath: when it was put vp, the Archbishop
of Canterbury girt it vnto his side.
                  Then was the Crowne of S. Edward brought thither, and by that Archbishop
set vpon the Kings head.
                  All these ceremonies, and Diuine Seruice finished, the King with the
same pompe he came to the Church, returned to the Pallace: in the mids
whereof was a fountaine which flowed with wine, white and red.
                  At dinner, the King did sit at the first table: at the second sate the fiue
chiefe Peeres of the kingdome: at the third, the Mayor and Aldermen:
at the fourth, the nine new made Knights: at the fifh, the Knights & Gentlemen
of the Kings house.
                  So long as the King did sit, the Prince of Wales stood on his right hand,
holding the Ecclesiasticall sword: and on the left hand stood the Constable
of England, shaking the sword of Iustice: vnder them stood the Marshall
holding the Scepter.
                  At the Kings table, besides the King, two Archbishops and three other
Bishops did sit.
                  In the dinner time a Knight well mounted & armed at all peeces, came
into the Hall: and before him rode an other horseman, that caried his
Launce; his name was Dymmock.
                  
                  
                     
This Champion hauing his sword drawen, and a Mace also ready, deliuered
vnto the king a scroule of paper: wherein was contained; that if any
Gentleman would denie that Henry there present, were not the lawfull
King of England, he was ready by Armes to maintaine it, where and when
the King should command.
                  This Cartell was deliuered to a King of Armes, and by the Kings commandement
proclaimed in the palace, and in sixe places of the Citie: but
no man found to say the contrary: and so the ceremonie of this Coronation
ended.

                  The Inauguration of Charles the French
King, at Rhemes, 1380.
                  
                     THis Charles the 6. King of France of that name, being twelue
yeeres olde, was crowned in the presence of the Dukes of
Anioy, Auuernia, Burgundy, Burbon, Brabant, Berry and Lorayn:
the Earle of Piedmont, the Earle of Marcury the Earle Eu,
and William Lord of Namur beeing present: the Earle of
Flanders and Bloys sent their deputies.
                  The King entred the citie of Rhemes, with a marueilous troupe of Lords
and Gentlemen: hauing before them thirty trumpets sounding.
                  His Maiestie alighted at our Lady Church: and thither resorted vnto
him his cosins of Albert, Nauarre, Barry, Harecourt, and other yong Princes
and Lords of the blood, whom the next day he dubbed Knights.
                  On Sonday after, the King went vnto the Church, which was most
sumptuously prepared. There the Bishop crowned his Maiestie, and anointed
him with that oyle wherewith Saint Remigius had anointed Clodoueus
the first Christian King of France.
                  
                  That Oyle was miraculously (as is reported) sent from heauen by an
Angel, purposely to anoint Clodoueus. And being preserued euer since a
glasse, although all the kings haue bene therwith anointed, yet is the quantity
thereof no whit decreased.
                  The King being come before the high Altar, did honour all the yong
men aforesayd, with Knighthood: and that done hee kneeled vpon rich
foote Carpets that were there spred: at his feete the yong Princes (newly
made Knights) did sit: and Oliuer Clisson, newly also aduanced to be Constable
of the kingdome, performed his office; and there (amids the nobility)
with all pomp possible, the King was crowned.
                  Then to the end that all men might haue cause to reioice, the King was
pleased to remit and forgiue all taxations, subsidies and impositions by
what name soeuer, lately inuented.
                  The Coronation finished, his Maiestie returned to the palace, where his

table was prepared, and hereat (besides the King) did sit the Dukes, his
vncles, viz. the Duke of Brabant, Anioy, Auuernia, Burgundy, and Burbon,
and on his right hand sate the Archbishop of Rhemes with other Lords of
the Spiritualty.
                  Touching meaner Lords of the kingdome, they shifted for place where
it could be found.
                  The Admirals Coucy, Clisson, and Tremoly had their tables equally couered
with Carpets of Tissue.
                  The next day the King dined, according to ancient vse: and the charge
of the Inauguration was defrayd by the Citizens of Rhemes.
                  
                  These ceremonies being consummate with great pomp, triumph, and
ioy, he returned to Paris.

                  At the Inauguration of King Henry the
third French King, three notable
things obserued.
                  
                     FIrst when he should haue bene anointed with the holy oile,
there was none found in the ceremonious Horne, which
for many yeeres had bene preserued by miracle as a relike
sent from heauen.
                  Secondly, when in the royall seate the Crowne was set
vpon his head by certaine Bishops, (as is accustomed) he cried out twise,
Oh it hurts me.
                  Thirdly, when he kneeled before the Altar during Masse, the Crowne
fell from his head, all which seemed ominous to the beholders, and so it
prooued both to himselfe and others.

                  The Inauguration of Charles the fift.
Anno 1520.
                  
                     THis Emperor hauing giuen order for his affaires in Belgica,
required the Electors, that they would come to his Inauguration
at Aquisgran, where the plague then happened to
be; which mooued them to desire, that the celebration
might be elswhere. But his Maiestie at the Citizens suite,
(who had prepared with great cost) resolued not to alter, alleaging also that
Charles the fourth his predecessor, had made a lawe, that the Emperour

ought of necessitie be crowned at Aquisgran.
                  
                  The 21. of October the Archbishop of Mentz, Colein and Treuer appeared.
                  The Marquesse of Brandenburg came after, and the Duke of Saxony being
sicke, stayed at Colein.
                  
                  The next day all these Princes rode to meete the Emperour, and when
they came neere vnto his person, they alighted; which done, with all reuerence
the Archbishop of Mentz (in the name of them all) spake vnto his
Maiestie, and was by the mouth of the Cardinall of Salisburg courteously
answered.
                  All those troupes so vnited, proceeded to the Citie.
                  Without the gate, the Palatin of the Rheine also did meete them, so
were the Electors companies about one thousand sixe hundreth; some
Launces, and some Archers.
                  The Emperours owne troupe was two thousand, very magnificently
furnished.
                  Thither also came Iohn Duke of Cleue, with 400. men well armed: and
much discord there was betweene the Cl
                           •
                        uoys and the Saxons, who should
preceed. The like pompe had not bene seene in Germanie.
                  
                  On th'one side of Caesar rode the Archbishop of Cullein: and on th'other
was the Archbishop of Mentz.
                  
                  Next to them folowed the Ambassadors of the King of Bohemia, the Bishops
of Sedun, Saltsburg and Croy, all Cardinals; and with them were the
Ambassadors of all Kings and Princes: sauing of the Pope, and the King
of England, which was supposed to be of purpose; lest the deputies of the
Germane Princes should preceed them.
                  The Emperor being come to Aquisgran, alighted at our Lady Church:
and there (after prayers) he talked particularly with the Electors, who followed
him to his lodging.
                  One other day they met againe in the Temple, where the throng was so
great, as hardly the Guard could make roome.
                  In the mids of the Temple, a great Crowne was hanged, and vnder it
carpets were spred, whereupon Caesar did prostrate himselfe, till the Archbishop
of Collen had ended certaine prayers.
                  Then the Archbishop of Mentz and Treuer did take him vp and led him
before our Ladies altar: where againe he fell downe vpon his face, and after
prayers, they led him to his throne of State.
                  When these ceremonies were ended, the Bishop of Cullen begunne the
Masse, and hauing said a part thereof, he asked the Emperor (in the Latine
tongue) If he would conserue the Christian faith? defend the Church? do Iustice?
protect the Empire? defend widowes, fatherlesse children, and people distressed?
Whereunto, when he had consented, hee was led to the Altar: and there
with a solemne othe, confirmed the words he had spoken, and returned to
his throne.
                  After the oath taken, the Bishop of Cullen said other prayers, and then
put oyle vpon his head, his brest, the bending places of his armes, and the
palmes of his hands.
                  
                     
Being thus anointed, the Archbishops of Mentz and Treuer led him into
the Vestry, where they apparelled him as a deacon, and in that habit
brought him forth, and placed him in his throne, where after more prayers,
the Archbishop of Cullen (in presence of the whole Clergie,) deliuered into
his hand a naked sword, and recommended to him the Common weale.
                  
                     Caesar hauing the sword in his hand, put it into the sheath: which done,
they put vpon his finger a Ring, and on his shoulders they cast a Regal
cloake.
                  They also deliuered to him a Scepter and a Ball, to represent the forme
of the whole world.
                  Then all the three Bishops layed hand on the Crowne, and set it vpon
the Emperours head.
                  When all these things were done, hee was againe brought vnto the Altar,
and there sworne to performe the duetie of a good Prince.
                  That oath taken, the Emperour accompanied with those Bishops, went
vp higher, and there sate in a seat of stone. Then the Bishop of Mentz (in
the Germane tongue) spake alowd, and wished that his Maiestie and people
to him subiect, might long liue in health and happinesse. After which
words, in signe of publicke ioy, the Quoristers and instruments of Musicke
made melody.
                  At all these solemne prayers the Lady Margarita aunt to the Emperor,
and gouernesse of the Low countreys was present.
                  In the end of these complements he receiued the Sacrament: and made
many Knights, which honour (as mine Auctor saith) was anciently the reward
of vertue and approued valor: but now the custome is, that if a King
do lightly lay his sword vpon any mans shoulder, that fauour alone, without
more ceremony or other merit, shall make him a Knight: which is the
cause, that title is giuen not only to Gentlemen well borne, but also to Merchants
and others, that ambitiously do seeke it.
                  All these things being done in the Church, the Emperour returned to
his Pallace, which was most magnificently prepared. There he dined:
and so did the Electors: euery one sitting at a table by himselfe.
                  The dinner being ended, and the tables taken away: the Bishop of Treuer
tooke place right against the Emperour, for so the law of Charlemaine
determined.
                  In ages more ancient, an oxes body filled full of small beasts and fowles,
was rosted, on the day of Caesars Inauguration, whereof one part was serued
at his table, the rest giuen to the multitude. Two Conduits were likewise
made to runne wine all that day.
                  Dinner being done, the Emperour retired into his chamber, and there
he deliuered the seales of the Empire vnto the Archbishop of Mentz: and
the next day all the Electors supped with his Maiestie.

at Iousts and Tournaments.
                  
                     AT euery publique triumph before a Prince, it seemeth the
vse heretofore hath ben, that the Prizes of best desert should
be giuen by the hand of the Queene, notwithstanding it
were in the Kings presence: but first a solemne proclamation
to be made by the Heralds, to this effect.
                  
                     Oyez, oyez, oyez: Be it knowen to all men by these presents, that by authority
of the most high, most excellent, and most puissant Prince H. by
the grace of God King of England, France, and Ireland, &c. That of those
which haue Iousted on the Challengers side, A. B. hath deserued the prize,
and to him let the same be giuen as due, by the censure of the Queene, with
the assent of her Ladies, Gentlewomen, and all others of her Highnesse
Court here present.
                  Likewise on the party of Defenders, C. D. hath Iousted well, E. F. better,
but G. H. best of all: vnto whome the prize is iudged by the most mightie,
most excellent, and vertuous Princesse with consent aforesaid.
                  This was the forme of deliuering the prizes, at the most noble and triumphant
Iousts performed by King Henry the eight & Francis the French
King, with their Nobility and Gentlemen of Armes, at their enteruiew in
Picardie, where the Proclamation in forme aforesaid was pronounced in
English and French.
                  It seemeth that in ages more ancient the vse was, that the Prince did also
giue a letter of attestation to such persons as gained any prize, either in
combat for life or honour: for my selfe haue read such a one granted by a
King of France vnto an Italian Gentleman, in these words following: wherunto
was added an honourable ceremony.

                  Of Iusts and Turneaments, and how the accidents
in such exercises are to be iudged in
the Kingdome of Naples.
                  
                     IT is written, how at a triumph in the noble citie of Naples,
a Gentleman called the L. Peter Counte of Derise, receiued
so furious an encounter by the Launce of another that ran
against him, that therewith he became at one instant disarmed
of his shield, his Curats and Headpeece, so as he being
vtterly disarmed, was left on horsebacke in his doublet onely, without other
harme. In requital whereof, the said Peter gaue vnto the other Gentleman
so violent a blow, as therewith the girthes of the horse were broken,
and the man cast headlong on the ground.
                  Whereupon a question was moued, which of them had merited most
honour, or rather which of them deserued least reproch? Whereunto was
answered absolutely, that he who fell from the horse, was most dishonored,
for (next vnto death) to fall from the horse is most reprochfull.
                  Yet it is lesse disgrace to fall with the horse, then to fal alone: and therefore,
albeit a man doth runne neuer so well, if in the end he doth fall from
the horse, he can by no meanes receiue honour for that day, but shal rather
depart with disgrace.
                  Who so fighteth on foot at Barrier, or in any other exercise of Armes,
is by the force of his aduersary constrained with his hand to touch the
ground, shall thereby lose all commendation.
                  He that on horsebacke directeth his Launce at the head, is more to be
praised, then he that toucheth lower. For the higher the Launce hitteth,
the greater is the Runners commendation.
                  Whoso runneth low is not onely vnworthy praise, but also meriteth reproch.
And he who so carieth his Launce comely and firme, is more to be
praised, although he breake not, then he who misgouerneth his horse, or
vnskilfully handleth his Launce, although he doeth breake.
                  He that vseth to runne high, sitteth steadily and mooueth least in his
course, accompanying his horse euenly and iustly, is in running worthy all
commendation.
                  He that falleth with the encounter of the aduersary, although (as is before
said) the same be a great disgrace: yet is it more excuseable, then if he
remaineth on horsebacke amazed, suffering his horse to wander he wotteth
not whither.
                  He that with his Launce taketh away the rest of the aduersaries Armor,
meriteth more honour, then he that taketh away any other ornament.
                  He that breaketh his Launce on the pomel or bolster of his aduersaries

faddle, deserueth worse then he who beareth his Launce well without
breaking.
                  He that breaketh on the face or other part of the horse, meriteth worse
then he that breaketh not at all.
                  He that hurteth an horse, shall not receiue honour, although before he
hath run well: for he that hurteth an horse is in like predicament with him
that falleth, who cannot on that day receiue any honour.
                  He is worthy small estimation that cannot gouerne his owne horse, or
that sitteth loose in his saddle: but much is he to be praised, that with his
force disordereth his aduersary in the saddle.
                  He that letteth his Launce fall, can claime no commendation. And
lesse worthy praise is he that knoweth not how it should be charged.
                  He that breaketh the Launce furiously in many pieces, is more reputed,
then he that breaketh it faintly in one onely place.
                  He that conueyeth his Lance into the Rest in due time, is worthy commendation:
but he that carieth it shaking in his hand, or vnstayedly in the
Rest, meriteth blame.
                  He that dexteriously carieth the Launce long on the arme, and skilfully
conueyeth it into the Rest nere the time of encounter, is more allowed,
them he that suddenly and at the first setting out doth charge it.
                  To conclude, he is worthy all commendation, that beareth himselfe wel
on horsebacke, that sitteth comely, that fitteth his body well with Armor,
that hath his person so disposed, as if it were without Armor, that can endure
to weare it long, & that till the end of the day disarmeth not his head.
                  He that performeth not all his determined courses, ought not receiue
any prize or honor.
                  He that hurteth or toucheth an horse with his Launce, shal neither haue
prize nor praise, for he is in case as though he had fallen.
                  He that doth fall, may not run any more in that day, vnlesse he falleth
on his feet standing right vp, and be also a Challenger: for in that case he
may returne to horse & answere all commers, because on that day hee is so
bound to doe.

shalbe allowed three speares broken.
                  
                  
                     Here followeth how Speares broken shall

haue no prize.
                     HAuing here spoken of forreine triumphs, I thinke it not impertinent
(and haply my duety also) to remember what honour hath bene by
like Actions done vnto the Kings of England our own natural Souereigns.
For albeit the Romans, the Persians, & Syrians being heretofore the most
mighty Monarches of the world, and consequently of greatest pompe, yet
in later time (and chiefly within these 500. yeeres) no Prince Christian
hath liued more honourably then the Kings of England. And as their
prowesse in Armes hath bene great, so their Courts for magnificence and
greatnesse needed not giue place to any, which may appeare by the often
and excellent triumphes celebrated before Kings and Queenes of this
land. Yea certaine it is, that neither France, Spaine, Germany or other Nation
Christian was euer honoured with so many Militarie triumphes, as England
hath bene, chiefly in the raigne of her Maiestie who now liueth: as
hereafter shal appeare. For besides other excellent triumphal Actions, and
Militarie pastimes since her Maiesties raigne, a yeerely (and as it were ordinary)
triumph hath bene celebrated to her Highnesse honour, by the
noble and vertuous Gentlemen of her Court; a custome neuer before vsed
not knowen in any Court or Countrey. And albeit (as hath bene formerly
remembred) the Triumphes of Germany were of great pompe and notable,
yet because they were furnished with the whole number of Princes
and Nobilitie of that Nation, (and the celebration rare) they seeme to me
lesse admirable then our owne, which haue continued more then 30.
yeeres yeerely, without intermission; and performed chiefly (and in effect
onely) by the Princes, Lords and Gentlemen dayly attendant vpon her
Maiesties Royal person. Whereby the honour of those Actions is indeed
due to her Highnesse Court onely.

Ladies: brought before the Kings
of England.
                  
                     A Triumph before King Edward the third. 1343.
                     
                        THis King being the most warlike and vertuous Prince that
liued in his dayes, happened (as mine Author saith) to fall
in loue with a noble Lady of his Kingdome, and desiring
both to honour her, and please himselfe with her presence,
conuited all noble Ladies, to behold a triumph at London,
to be there performed by the Nobles, and Gentlemen of his Court. This

intention his Maiestie did command to be proclaimed in Fraunce, Henault,
Flanders, Brabant and other places: giuing Passeport and secure abode to
all noble strangers, that would resort into England. That done, he sent vnto
al Princes, Lords and Esquiers of the Realme, requiring that they with their
wiues, daughters and cosins, should at the day appointed, appeare at his
Court.
                     To this feast came William Earle of Henault, and Iohn his brother with
many Barons, and Gentlemen. The triumph continued 15. dayes, and euery
thing succeeded well, had not Iohn the sonne and heire of Vicount Beaumount
bene there slaine.
                     In this triumph also appeared the Earle of Lancaster, and Henry his son.
The Earle of Darby. The Lord Robert of Artoys. The Erle of Richmount. The
Earle of Northampton. The Earle of Glocester. The Earle of Warwicke. The
Earle of Salisbury. The Earle of Pembroke. The Earle of Hartford. The Earle
of Arundel. The Earle of Cornewall. The Earle of Norffolke. The Earle of
Suffolke. The Baron of Stafford with others.
                     In the raigne of the same King Edward, a Royall Iust was holden at Lincoln
                              •
                           
                        
by the Duke of Lancaster, where were present certaine Ambassadors
sent by the King of Spaine, for the Lady Ioane daughter to the King, who
should haue bene married vnto that King of Spaine: but meeting her on
the way, she died.
                     A triumph was holden at Windsor before the same King Edward, whereat
was present Dauid King of Scots, the Lord of Tankeruile, and the Lord
Charles de Valoys, who by the Kings license was permitted to runne, and had
the prize. Anno 1349.
                     In Smithfield were solemne Iusts in the same Kings raigne, where was
present a great part of the most valiant Knights of England and France.
Thither came also noble persons of other Nations, and Spaniards, Cipriots,
Armenians, who at that time humbly desired aide against Pagans. An. 1361.

                     IVsts were againe holden in Smithfield, where Anthony Wooduile Lord
Scales did runne against the Bastard of Burgundie. Anno 1444.
                  
                  
                     A triumph before King Henry the sixt.
                     ONe other notable Action of Armes was personally performed in
Smithfield, betweene a Gentleman of Spaine called Sir Francis le Arogonoys,
and Sir Iohn Astley Knight of the Garter. For after the said Sir Francis
had wonne the honour from all the men at Armes in France, he came
into England and made a generall challenge, but by the great valour of Sir
Iohn Astley lost the same vnto him.
                  
                  
                     Triumphs before King Henry the seuenth.
                     AT Richmont was holden a solemne triumph, which continued a whole
moneth, where Sir Iames Parker running against Hugh Vaughan, was
hurt and died. 1494.
                     One other triumph was in the same Kings daies performed in the Tower
of London. Anno 1502.
                  
                  
                     
                     Triumphs before King Henry the eight.
                     BVt farre exceeding all these, was that magnificent Iust and Tournament
at the meeting of the two excellent Princes, King Henry the eight
of England, and Francis the French King, who chusing vnto them fourteen
others, did challenge to run at the Tilt, and fight both at the Tourney and
Barrier with all commers. The Challengers were, the King of England,
the French King, the Duke of Suffolke, the Marquesse Dorset, Sir William
Kingston, Sir Richard Ierningham, Master Nicholas Carew, and Master Anthonie
Kneuet, with their Assistants, Sir Rowland and Sir Giles Capel: with these

                           onshire,
and the Lord Edmond Howard, euery of them bringing in a faire band
of Knights well armed.
                     This most noble challenge of these two mighty Kings accompanied

English Knights, viz. Sir Iohn Dudley, Sir Thomas Seimor, Sir Francis

least superstuous cost of golde, siluer, embrodery, or curiositie of workemanship.

wherein were Challengers, the Earle of Oxenford, Charles Howard nowe
Lord Admirall, Sir Henrie Lea, and Sir Christopher Hatton, now Knights of

                     This Triumph continued three dayes: the first at Tilt, the second at
Turney, and the third at the Barrier.
                     On euery of the Challengers her Maiestie bestowed a prize, for the recieuing
whereof, they were particularly led armed by two Ladies, vnto her
presence Chamber.
                     The prize at the Tilton the Defenders party was giuen vnto Henry Gray;
at the Tourney, to the Lord Henry Seamor: at the Barriers to Thomas Cecil.
Before them went Clarencieux King of Armes, in his Rich coate of Armes.
                     
                        
This magnificent triumph was performed, Anno 1571.
                     An honourable Challenge was likewise brought before her Maiestie,
by the Earle of Arundell, calling himselfe Callophisus, who with his assistant
Sir William Drurie, challenged all commers. Anno 1580.
                  
                  
                     The Defenders were,
                     THe Earle of Oxford, the Lord Windsor, Phillip Sidney, Edward Norris,
Henrie Knowles, Robert Knowles, Fulk Griuell, Thomas Kneuet, Thomas
Kellaway, Rafe Bowes, George Goring, George Gifford, Anthonie Cooke, Henrie
Bronkard, Edward Denny, Richard Ward, Thomas Parrot. The prize was giuen
to the Earle of Oxford.
                     
                     To these actions of Armes, we may adde a notable Tourneament on
horsebacke, solemnized within her Maiesties pallace at Westminster:
which became the more rare and memorable, because it was performed in
the night. The manner whereof in briefe was thus.
                     It pleased her Maiestie, (according to her Princely custome in the intertainement
of noble strangers) to conuite vnto supper the Duke Memorancie,
chiefe Marshall of France, at that time come thither to receiue the
honourable order of the Garder. This magnificent supper ended, it pleased
her Highnesse (the weather being warme) to walke out of her chamber
into the open Tarrace, whither also (awayting on her) went the sayd
Duke, and all others of the French Nobilitie, with the Ambassadours,
Lords and Ladies of the Court. At her Maiesties comming to the North
side of the Tarrace, there were prepared and set rich chaires, cushions and
carpets. In which place it pleased her to stay, entertayning most gratiously
the said Duke, and other Noble strangers. Next vnto them were placed
the Ladies, Lords, Counsellers, and other persons of reputation, according
to their degrees and conuenience of the roome. So as the said Tarrace
was on all sides beset with Lord, Ladies, and persons of qualitie,
sumptuously apparelled, and richly furnished, and among them (both aboue
and vnder) stood many of the Guard in their rich coates, holding an
infinite number of Torches: and so in the preaching place: by which
meane, those that beheld the Tarrace in this sort furnished, deemed it rather
a Theater celestiall, then a pallace of earthly building.
                     The place with this Royall presence replenished, suddainly entred Walter
Earle of Essex, and with him twelue Gentlemen armed at all peeces, and
well mounted. The Earle and his horse was furnished with white cloth of
siluer, and the rest in white sattin, who after reuerence done to her Maiesty,
marched to the East side of the Court, and there in troope, stood firme.
Forthwith entred Edward Earle of Rutland, with a like number, in like sort
armed and apparelled all in blew: and hauing presented his reuerence,
stayed on the West end. Before either of these bands, one Chariot was
drawen, and therein a faire Damsell, conducted by an armed Knight, who
pronounced certaine speeches in the French tongue, vnto her Maiestie.
These Ceremonies passed, The Queene commanded the armed men to
fall vnto fight: which was performed with great courage, and commendation,
chiefly in the Earle of Essex, a noble personage, valorous in armes,

and all other wayes of great vertue. Truely this Action was marueilously
magnificent, and appeared a sight exceeding glorious to those that were
below looking vpward to the Tarrace, where her Maiestie, the Lords and
Ladies stood, so pompously apparelled, iewelled and furnished, as hardly
can be seene the like in any Christian Court, as my selfe saw, and other the
Actors (at occasions staying from fight) with great admiration did behold
and thinke.
                     Of the Actors names in this Triumph (it seemeth) no note is kept: yet
are many of them liuing.
                     Not inferiour, but farre exceeding in princely pompe and qualitie of
Actors was that Royall combat and fight on foote before her Maiestie the
first of Ianuarie, Anno 1
                           •
                        81. where Mounsieur brother vnto the French
King, the Prince of D'Aufine, the Earle of Sussex, the Earle of Leicester, the
Count S. Aignon, Mounsieur Chamuallon, and Mounsieur Bacqueuile were
Challengers.
                  
                  
                     The Defenders were,
                     
                        THe Lord Thomas Howard, Sir William Russell, Mounsieur Brunis, Mounsieur
S. Vincent, Sir Thomas Cecill, Henry Gray, Iohn Borough, Lord Windsor,
Walter Windsor, Le Boylere, Le Cheualaier, Ambrose Willoughbie, Sir William
Drury, Thomas Radcliffe, Lord Sheffeeld, Robert Gray, Rafe Lane, George
Carew, Fulke Greuill, William Knowles, Francis Knowles, Thomas Bedingfeild,

Henrie Bronkard, Iohn Parker, Francis Darcy, Iohn Tirrell.
                     They are not here placed according to their degrees, but as they were
called to fight: and with such titles as they then had.
                     After these particular Triumphes, we may not forget the ordinary exercises
of Armes, yeerely vsed in memory of the applause of her Maiesties
Subiects, at the day of her most happy ascension to the crowne of England.
In which Actions diuers chiefe Lords and Gentlemen of the Realme (and
some strangers also) appeared, though (indeede) the greatest number (and
in effect all) were ordinary attendants vpon her Maiesties Court.

                  The Originall occasions of the yeerely
Triumphs in England.
                  
                     HEre will we remember also (and I hope without enuie so
may) that these annuall exercises in Armes, solemnized
the 17. day of Nouember, were first begun and occasionaed
by the right vertuous and honourable Sir Henry Lea,
Master of her Highnesse Armorie, and now deseruingly
Knight of the most noble Order, who of his great zeale,
and earnest desire to eternize the glory of her Maiesties Court, in the beginning
of her happy reigne, voluntarily vowed (vnlesse infirmity, age,
or other accident did impeach him) during his life, to present himselfe
at the Tilt armed, the day aforesayd yeerely, there to performe in honor
of her sacred Maiestie the promise he formerly made. Whereupon
the Lords and Gentlemen of the sayd Court, incited by so worthy an example,
determined to continue that custome, and not vnlike to the ancient
Knighthood della Banda in Spaine, haue euer since yerely assembled in
Armes accordingly: though true it is, that the Author of that custome (being
now by age ouertaken) in the 33. yeere of her Maiesties reigne resigned
and recommended that office vnto the right noble George Earle of Cumberland.
The ceremonies of which assignation were publiquely performed
in presence of her Maiestie, her Ladies and Nobilitie, also an infinite number
of people, beholding the same, as followeth.
                  On the 17. day of Nouember, Anno 1590. this honourable Gentleman
together with the Earle of Cumberland, hauing first performed their seruice
in Armes, presented themselues vnto her Highnesse, at the foot of the
staires vnder her Gallery window in the Tilt yard at Westminster, where at
that time her Maiestie did sit, accompanied with the Vicount Turyn Ambassador
of France, many Ladies, and the chiefest Nobilitie.
                  Her Maiesty beholding these armed Knights comming toward her, did
suddenly heare a musicke so sweete and secret, as euery one thereat greatly
marueiled. And hearkening to that excellent melodie, the earth as it
were opening, there appeared a Pauilion, made of white Taffata, containing
eight score elles, being in proportion like vnto the sacred Temple of
the Virgins Vestall. This Temple seemed to consist vpon pillars of Pourferry,
arched like vnto a Church, within it were many Lampes burning.
Also, on the one side there stood an Altar couered with cloth of gold, and
thereupon two waxe candles burning in rich candlesticks, vpon the Altar
also were layd certaine Princely presents, which after by three Virgins
were presented vnto her Maiestie. Before the doore of this Temple stood
a crowned Pillar, embraced by an Eglantine tree, whereon there hanged a
Table; and therein written (with letters of gold) this prayer following.
                  
                  
                     Elizae. &c.
                     PIae, Potenti, Foelicissimae virgini,
                     Fidei, Pacis, Nobilitatis vindici,
                     Cui Deus, Astra, Virtus,
                     Summa deuouerunt
omnia.
                     Post tot Annos, tot Triumphos,
                     Animam ad pedes positurus
                     Tuos,
                     Sacra Senex
                     affixit Arma.
                     Vitam quetam, Imperium, famam
                     Aeternam, aeternam,
precatur tibi,
                     Sanguine redempturus suo.
                     Vltra columnas Herculis
                     Columna moueatur Tua.
                     Corona superet Coronas omnes,
                     vt quam coelum foelicissime
nascenti Coronam dedit,
                     Beatissima moriens reportes coelo.
                     Summe, Sancte, Aeterne,
                     Audi, exaudi,
                     Deus.
                  
                  The musicke aforesayd, was accompanied with these verses, pronounced
and sungs by M. Hales her Maiesties seruant, a Gentleman in that Arte
excellent, and for his voice both commendable and admirable.
                  
                     My golden locks time hath to siluer turnd,
                     (Oh time too swift, and swiftnes neuer ceasing)
                     My youth gainst age, and age at youth hath spurnd.
                     But spurnd in vaine, youth waineth by encreasing.
                     Beauty, strength, and youth, flowers fading beene,
                     Duety, faith and loue, are rootes and euer greene.
                  
                  
                     
                     My Helmet now shall make an hiue for Bees,
                     And louers songs shall turne to holy Psalmes:
                     A man at Armes must now sit on his knees,
                     And feed on pray'rs, that are old ages almes.
                     And so from Court to Cottage I depart,
                     My Saint is sure of mine vnspotted hart.
                  
                  
                     And when I sadly sit in homely Cell,
                     I'le teach my Swaines this Carrol for a song,
                     Blest be the hearts that thinke my Souereigne well,
                     Curs'd be the soules that thinke to doe her wrong.
                     Goddesse, vouch safe this aged man his right,
                     To be your Beadsman now, that was your Knight.
                  
                  The gifts which the Vestall maydens presented vnto her Maiesty, were
these: A vaile of white exceeding rich and curiously wrought: a cloke and
safegard set with buttons of gold, and on them were grauen Emprezes of
excellent deuise: in the loope of euery button was a noble mans badge,
fixed to a pillar richly embrodered.
                  And here (by way of digression) let vs remember a speech which this
noble Gentleman vsed at such time as these buttons were set vpon the garment
aforesaid: I would (quoth he) that all my friends might haue bene
remembred in these buttons, but there is not roome enough to containe
them all; and if I haue them not all, then (said hee) those that are left out,
may take exception. Whereunto another standing by, answered: Sir, let
as many be placed as can be, and cause the last button to be made like the
Caracter of &c. Now Godamercie with all my heart (quoth the Knight)
for I would not haue giuen the Caetera of my friends for a milion of gold.
                  But to returne to the purpose, These presents and prayer being with
great reuerence deliuered into her Maiesties owne hands, and he himselfe
disarmed, offered vp his armour at the foot of her Maiesties crowned pillar;
and kneeling vpon his knees, presented the Earle of Cumberland, humbly
beseeching she would be pleased to accept him for her Knight, to continue
the yeerely exercises aforesaid. Her Maiesty gratiously accepting of
that offer, this aged Knight armed the Earle, and mounted him vpon his
horse. That being done, he put vpon his owne person a side coat of blacke
Veluet pointed vnder the arme, and couered his head (in liew of an helmet)
with a buttoned cap of the countrey fashion.
                  After all these ceremonies, for diuers dayes hee ware vpon his cloake a
crowne embrodered, with a certaine motto or deuice, but what his intention
therein was, himselfe best knoweth.
                  Now to conclude the matter of assignation, you shall vnderstand, that
this noble Gentleman by her Maiesties expresse commandement, is yerely

(without respect vnto his age) personally present at these military exercises,
there to see, suruey, and as one most carefull & skilfull to direct them;
for indeed his vertue and valour in Arms is such as deserueth to command.
And touching that point, I will let you know the opinion of Monsieur de
Champany, a Gentleman of great experience and notable obseruation,
who at his beeing Embassadour in England for causes of the Low Countreys,
and writing to his friends there, in one of his intercepted Letters, among
other occurrents these words were found: I was (quoth he) one day
by Sir Christopher Hatton Captaine of her Maiesties guard inuited to Eltham,
an house of the Queenes, whereof he was the guradian: At which
time I heard and saw three things that in all my trauel of France, Italy, and
Spaine, I neuer heard or saw the like. The first was a consort of musicke, so
excellent and sweet as cannot be expressed. The second a course at a Bucke
with the best and most beautifull Greyhounds that euer I did behold. And
the third a man of Armes excellently mounted, richly armed, and indeed
the most accomplished Caualiero I had euer seene. This Knight was called
Sir Henry Lea, who that day (accompanied with other Gentlemen of the
Court) onely to doe me honour, vouchsafed at my returne to Greenwich
to breake certaine Lances: which action was performed with great dexterity
and commendation. Thus much was the substance (and well neere
the whole circumstance) of Sir Henry Lea his last taking of Armes: wherein
he seemed to imitate the auncient Romanes, who hauing serued a conuenient
time, and claiming the priuiledges due to old Souldiers (whome
they called Emeriti) did come into Campo Martio, euery man leading his
owne horse; and there offered his Armes vnto Mars in presence of the
chiefe Magistrates: which ceremony, Scipio, Cassius, the great Pompey, with
many other noble Captaines, disdained not to doe.
                  Summarily, these annuall Actions haue bene most nobly perfourmed
(according to their times) by one Duke, 19 Earles, 27 Barons, 4 Knights
of the Garter, and aboue 150 other Knights and Esquiers.
                  
                     The Authors Intention.
                     
                        NOw fora much as all that which hath bene hitherto said,
doeth tend to extoll the excellencie of Armes and honour,
with the dignities to them appertaining: Yet for
not being mistaken in my meaning, I haue thought good
to say, that the commendation due vnto learning, is of no
lesse desart then that which belongeth to Marshall merit.
And indeed very rarely doeth any man excell in Armes, that is vtterly
ignorant of good letters: For what man vnlearned can conceiue the ordering
and disposing of men, in marching, incamping, and fighting, without
Arithmetique? Or who can comprehend the ingenious fortifications or
instruments apt for Offence or Defence of Townes, or passing of waters, vnlesse

he hath knowledge of Geometrie? or how may Sea seruice be performed
without skill to know the Latitude of the place, by the Pole, and the
Longitude by other Starres? which must be learned of Astronomers. Yea,
learning is of such necessitie, that no common weale without it can be well
gouerned, neither was any State euer well ordered, vnlesse the Gouernors
thereof had studied Philosophie: chiefly that part, that intreateth of maners:
for that onely informeth, first, how euery man should gouerne himselfe:
Secondly, how hee should guide his owne family, and thirdly
teacheth, how a Citie or Common weale may be well ordered and gouerned,
both in warre and peace. Which moued Plato to say, That happy is the
common weale where either the Prince is a Philosopher, or where a Philosopher is
the Prince. And although it cannot be denied that Empires and Kingdomes
are both wonne and kept, aswell by force and manhood, as by wisdome
and pollicie: yet is the chiefe of that pollicie attained vnto by learning.
For in all gouernments, the wiser haue authoritie aboue the rude and
vnlearned: as in euery priuate house or towne, the most discreet and best
experienced are preferred; so in all Nations they that be most ciuill, learned
and politique, doe finde meanes to command the rest: although in
force, they be inferiour. The experience hereof was apparantly seene in
the Grecians and Romanes; among whom, like as wisedome and learning
was most esteemed, so their Empires were spread furthest, and continued
longest. And to prooue that excellencie of learning in those Nations preuailed
against others equall to them in manhood and courage, we also will
vse this onely example: That albeit this Realme before any conquest thereof,
was (no doubt) inhabited with people of great courage; yet for that
they were vnciuil, or at the least, without policie and learning, they were
brought vnder the subiection of other Nations: as the Saxons were last by
the Normans, and the Romanes by the Saxons before that, and the Britaines
by the Romanes first of all.
                     And albeit diuers men haue bene and yet are, both wise and politique
without learning, and some also that be learned (in respect of wordly policie)
be very simple: yet I say, that such wise men should haue bene more
excellent, if they had bene learned, and the other more simple and foolish,
they had bene vtterly without learning.
                     Exercise in warre maketh not euery man fit to be a Captaine, though he
follow Armes neuer so long: and yet is there none so vnapt for warre, but
with vse is more perfect, and the rather if he be learned. For if experience
doeth helpe, then I am sure that learning helpeth much more to the encrease
of wisedome. We will then determine, that experience, because it
doeth further Wisedome, may be called the father thereof, and Memorie
the mother; because she doth nourish and preserue it: for in vaine should
experience bee sought for, if the same were not held in remembrance.
Then if both experience and memory be holpen and encreased by learning,
it must needs be confessed, that experience helpeth it.
                     Euery man seeth that the experience of an old man, maketh him wiser
then the yonger, because he hath seene more. 
                           •
                        et an old man seeth onely
things in his owne time; but the learned ma
                           •
                         seeth not onely his owne

age and experience, but whatsoeuer hath bene in long time past; yea since
the first writer tooke pen in hand, & therefore must needs know more then
the vnlearned man, be he neuer so old: for no memory can compare with
writing. Besides that, if the vnlearned doe forget any thing seene, hardly
shall hee reduce it to memory againe: whereas the learned man by turning
his booke, hath meane to call to remembrance, what hee happeneth
to forget. Therefore as he that liueth fourescore yeeres, must needes
haue more experience then he that liueth fortie: so he that seeth in bookes,
the actions of men a thousand yeres, knoweth more then he, that by liuing
one hundreth yeeres could attaine vnto. In like manner, if he that trauaileth
many Nations, be of more experience then others of like age, that
neuer went from their natiue Countrey: so he that is learned, by Cosmographie,
histories, and other learning, seeth the maner and vsage of euery
countrey in the world, yea of many more than is possible for one man (in
all his life) to trauell through: and of those he trauaileth, much better doth
he learne, by small abode there, then an other by longer experience that is
altogether vnlearned. By this learning also we may conceiue the situation,
Temperature, and qualitie of euery Countrey throughout the world.
Also through the Science of Astronomy we know the course of Planets
aboue, and their aspects and coniunctions, which the learned men in times
past attained vnto by long conference and obseruation: but we by perusing
their bookes onely, may learne it: yet without that helpe we could neuer.
To conclude, there is nothing either of profit or necessitie for mans life,
but by learning is taught more perfectly, than it can be compassed by experience,
or other meane whatsoeuer.
                     But leauing the commodities of learning to be discoursed by those that
are learned in deede, this onely I say, that the endeuour of Gentlemen,
ought be either in Armes or learning, or in them both. And in my poore
conceit, hardly deserueth he any title of honour, that doth not take pleasure
in the one or the other.
                     For as no liuing creature is borne to idlenesse, so is there no doubt, but
God and nature hath destined ech one, for some commendable businesse.
                     And like as base occupations are fit for folke of base fortune, so valiant
and venturous minds, in actions of honour and vertue should be employed.
And if in this earthly life any there be that meriteth fame or fauor, surely
the same is a vertuous life and valorous endeuor. Wherof Iuuenal saith:

                           Res gerere & captos ostendere ciuibus hostes,
                           Atting it solium Iouis, & caele

                     The Authors conclusion.
                     WE haue said in our former discourse, that no man of any qualitie or
fortune, is borne or destined to ease, idlenesse, or vnprofitable occupation:
we haue likewise touched the commodities of such learnings, as
are required in actions both Ciuill and Martiall, whereby may appeare,
how necessary it is for all Gentlemen to indeuour themselues in the one
and the other, as those knowledges whereby men are made worthy of honourable

title. Notwithstanding, through corrupt custome or bad education,
the greater part of our English gentlemen, are not onely ignorant,
what honour and vertue meaneth, but consequently doe disdaine (or at
the least wise lightly regard) those labours whereby they might and ought
become comfortable to friends, and seruiceable to their Prince and countrie:
which happily mooued the Poet to forewarne fathers to haue care of
their childrens education, saying,

                           Gratum est quod patriae 
                                 •
                              iuem Populo
                                 
                                    
                                 
                                 que
                               dedisti,
                           Si facis vt patriae sit idoneus, vtilis agris.
                           Vtilis & bellorum & pacis rebus agendis.
                        
                     
                     And continuing the consideration of this matter, I am occasioned to
be sory, that our English youth doe not onely earnestly affect vaine pleasures,
and improfitable pastimes, as recreation: but also vse them with daily
labour, as their chiefe businesse, and speciall profession. And to speake
plaine, I am more then halfe perswaded, that great sort of our Gentlemen
(chiefly those that haue had their nurture at home with their owne ignorant
parents) doe take more comfort to be called good Faulkoners, or expert
woodmen, then either skilfull Souldiers, or learned Schollers. Yet
who so obserueth, shall find, that the same men by secret instinct of gentle
nature, doe not a litle glory in the ancient badges, titles, and seruices of
their Auncestors, supposing those passed merrits (supported with riches)
ought, without further sufficiencie, make them more worthy then others,
whose owne proper labour and vertue haue indeede deserued much honour.
But as no fowle flyeth with the wings of another, nor no horse doth
runne on legges not his owne, so should no man be praysed or admired for
the vertue or good merit of another. And albeit the fame of Auncestors
honour, may (for some short space) maintaine a certaine hope of vertue,
(chiefly where no vice appeareth) yet time, which doth distinguish things
indeede, from those that onely appeare, will also (like vnto counterfeit
mettal) bewray the want or worth of euery man, and for such a one he shall
be knowen and esteemed, of what name, house, parentage or predecessor
soeuer he is descended. It therfore behoueth euery Gentleman well borne,
to embrace the loue of vertue, and in the actions thereof to employ the
course of his whole life For what can be more pleasing to a generous mind,
then the studie of wisedome? whereby to know good from euill, and truth
from falshood, the one to be followed, the other eschewed.
                     What may be more blessed then Iustice? whereby we refraine from all
iniuries, and giue vnto euery one that which to him appertaineth: what is
more noble then fortitude? which contēneth all wordly accidents, & with
inuincible courage fighteth for equity and right. And what is more beseeming
a noble personage then temperance? which teacheth comelines and
moderation, gouerning the passions & perturbations of mind, to the quietnesse
of mans life, and contentation of others. These, with other vertues
on them depending, haue from base birth and poore parentage, aduanced
many to great titles and dignity: and as those vertuous endeauors haue preferred
them, so discontinuance did vtterly deface that honor in their posteritie.
Vertue (I say) is that, which from meane estate hath raised the louers

therof to great reputation and glory. Among infinite examples (omitting
men of meaner fortune, yet worthy much honour) we haue Agathocles, Eumenes,
Pertinax, Dioclesian, Valentinian, with other Emperors, Kings, & Captaines.
Of like fortune in birth was M. Tullius, Cato, Horace, and diuers most
notable learned men: yea Socrates himselfe (who by the Oracle of Apollo was
iudged the wisest man aliue) had no great parentage. And Iulius Caesar, that
both in armes and learning excelled, was the first Emperor, and from low
degree aspired to excessiue glory. Notwithstanding, through protraction
of time, and the degeneration of posterity, not only their owne houses and
names are vanished, but also the honour & renowme of the nations where
they liued, is vtterly decayed and extinguished: which the Christian Poet
Palingenius did well expresse in these verses.
                     
                        Nempe diu res nulla manet, nempe omni
                              ••

                              que
                            referri,
                        Naturae imperio, & fatorum lege perenni:
                        Deinde iterum ex alio faetu instaurata renasci.
                     
                     Thus haue we heard the meanes of aspiring vnto honour, and by what
occasion the same is lost & decayed. But well I wot, that vnto these reasons
and examples produced to incite our English youth, they answere, That
were they sure to attaine vnto the least part of that fortune these great personages,
and many others their inferiours haue come vnto, then would
they not feare to aduenture their labor and liues to the vttermost: but because
the paines and perils are certein, & the successe doubtful, they thinke
it more wisdome to Hunt and Hawke at home, then hazard their bodies
abroad, or beate their braines about that, which haply shall neuer turne
them to profit. This silly allegation compounded of sloth and pusillanimitie,
may easily bee refelled, but rarely reformed: notwithstanding (for
that I am vsed to loose my labour) I will reply thereunto thus: That seeing
no reward is due before desert, and that honour is the recompence of vertue,
it may not be looked for, vntill some vertuous testimony be first shewed.
What Souldier is so simple, as entring into pay, wil at the first day looke
to be made a Captaine, or haue promise within fewe yeeres to become a
Generall? what Scholler will at his first comming to study, demand the degrees
due vnto Art, or shortly after (with little learning) will challenge to
be a Doctor? Yet true it is, that sometimes the simplest Archer doeth hit
the marke, which many an excellent shooter misseth; yet hardly will any
wise man bee brought to lay money on his side, or hope of such successe.
Euen so, in the attaining of Honor, although fauour and fortune oft times
preferreth the vnworthy: yet the true way and most likely meane thereunto,
is true vertue and industrious life. Wherefore concluding, I say, that
euery noble and magnanimous mind, doth not so much couet the reward
of vertue, as it taketh delight therein. As the Poet sayth:

                           Propter se virtus petitur, non propter honorem,
                           Ipsa licet propriè, ac verè, mer
                                 •

                        ALbeit the rankes and places appointed
to honourable Subiects, ought
euer to bee at the Princes disposition
and pleasure, (for so do we find in sacred
Scripture Hester cap. 6.) Yet the
Maiesty of our present Soueraigne hath
euer consented, that all noble personages,
Magistrates, and others of dignity
should precede according to order anciently
vsed in the reignes of her most noble
predecessors. Howsoeuer it be, true it is, that in diuers ages, and vpon
diuers considerations, some alteration hath bene: As sometimes the Prelates
haue taken place before Princes, and all other Lords: and some other
times the Temporall Lords and Officers did march next vnto the King.
In some other time the chiefe precedence was giuen to Dukes, Marquesses
and Earles, without respect vnto the Kings blood, his Alliance or fauour.
So as no absolute order, or precise rule hath bene on that behalfe obserued,
and is the cause that questions and confusion do oft times arise at the
assembly and meeting of great personages, and others of dignitie and reputation.
For auoiding of which inconueniences, it may please her royall
Maiestie, by princely power and sacred wisedome, to signifie her pleasure
on that behalfe; to the end that persons of dignitie, Magistrates, Officers,
and other subiects of qualitie, may be martialled and ranged accordingly.
For as good order is an ornament of great excellencie: so confusion causeth
discord, and is the roote of many most dangerous questions: which
moued the Philosophers to say, that the losse of worldly wealth is lesse
grieuous to men of generous minde, then the priuation of place and honorable
estimation. If then order in precedencie be a matter of so much consequence,
among persons of reputation; great heede and r
                        •
                     gard ought bee
had thereunto, to the end that Princes, Prelates, Magistrates, Officers,

Ministers, and all other of honourable and honest qualitie, should take
due places, without preiudice to their superiours or equals. For so great
is the force of ambition, as oftentimes priuate ostentation seeketh to put
backe true dignitie, and impudent presumption presumeth to step before
vertue, honour, and honourable merit.
               
               
                  CHAP. 1.
                  Of Honor in generall.
                  
                     HOnor, saith Cicero, is the reward of vertue, and infamie
the recompense of vice: whoso then desireth
to aspire vnto Honor, it behooueth him to come
thereunto by the way of vertue, which the Romanes
couertly expressed in building the Temple
of Honour, so as no man could passe thereunto,
but first he was forced to goe through the Church
dedicated to Vertue. But because the greatest number
of men, are not well informed what Vertue meaneth, it shall bee expedient
to say, that Vertue is a good habite, and true perfection of reason;
whereunto whoso will attaine, it behooueth him to consider, what and
how many the morall Vertues are, chiefly those fewe, of the which the rest
haue dependance. Therefore to begin with that which of all others is most
necessary for preseruation of humane societie, I say that Iustice is a vertue
which enformeth euery man to rest contented with so much as to him appertaineth,
and giue to all others that which to them belongeth. This is it
which conserueth peace, and whereof men be deseruingly called Good.
Next therunto we thinke Temperance or modestie, ought to accompanie
euery wise man, and chiefly him that hath authoritie ouer others: For no
man there is that can rightly iudge, howe to direct the maners of other
men, that knoweth not first how to gouerne him selfe. The rule whereof
is this vertue of Temperance: which teacheth a moderation of hope, and
feare; and of ioy, and sorow; with euery other affection or perturbation of
minde. Next vnto these (in euery man truely honourable) Fortitude deseruingly
requireth her place, as that which protecteth and defendeth the
actions both of moderation and Iustice. This is that vertue which enformeth
valiant men to fight for Iustice, and not to offend others, vnlesse iniurie
shall thereunto enforce. These I say are the chiefe and most honourable
of all morall vertues. Yet for that euery of them requireth the ayde
and excellencie of Prudence (being a vertue intellectiue) we wish that all
honourable personages should be therewith indued, considering that the

force thereof is a certaine naturall skill to distinguish the good from euill,
to desire the one, and detest the other, to say that is fit to be spoken, and
conceale that which is vnfit to be vttered: to prosecute that which is worthy,
and forsake that which is vicious and vile. Yea, the excellencie of
Prudence is such, as without it no other vertue can proceed: Which moued
some Philosophers to affirme, that Prudence alone included the force
and power of all vertues. But omitting to discourse more largely, I say,
that whosoeuer is possessed with so excellent graces, doth iustly deserue to
be accompted good and honourable: For albeit riches and authority be
vulgarly reputed great honors, yet whoso hath most high Titles, or dignities,
vnlesse his proceedings be such as are consonant to Iustice, he may be
accompted a man of more authoritie then vertue.
                  Likewise, he that immoderately and vntemperately pampereth his own
body, not confining his sensuall pleasures, vnto the bounds of reason, doth
seeme rather subiect to bestial voluptuousnesse, then vertuous moderation:
and consequently both vnable to gouerne himselfe, and vnapt to command
others.
                  Many other vertues there are fit to be found in euery honorrable personage,
but among them, pietie, liberalitie, mercie, and affabilitie are excellent
ornaments in euery noble and generous minde. It is not therefore
as ignorant persons and vnskilfull folke doe surmise, that great riches, or
titles of dignitie, do make men honourable, vnlesse they be accompanied
with the vertues and perfections aforesayd: for riches (albeit they are a
great ornament to illustrate vertue) yet are they not any efficient cause to
make men honourable.
                  Neither are dignities in descents of noble blood, enough to aduance
men vnto Honor: for whatsoeuer is not within vs, cannot be iustly called
ours, but rather the graces and goods of fortune.
                  And who so pleaseth to haue thereof more perfect proofe, let him lay
before his consideration some mechanicall man, that by prouidence or parcimony
hath aspired vnto excessiue riches, or by vndeserued fauour is aduanced
to high titles: yet in the opinion of those that doe indeed knowe
how to distinguish of euery mans merit, he shall be deemed rather notable
for his imperfections, then worthy of true Honor.
               
               
                  CHAP. 2.
                  Of Honour in particular, and with what complements
men are honoured.
                  
                     THe scope and marke of each mans endeauour, is either profit
or honour. The one proper to men in bare or meane fortune,
the other to persons of vertue and generous minde.
But now we will in this worke entreat only of the last: For
as one man is more worthy then another, so ought hee before

others to be preferred and honoured. It therefore behoueth to know
that Honour is a certaine testimony of ech mans excellency in vertue, and
who so desireth to be honored, must endeauour to win some apparant note
of worthinesse, either before God or men. In the first case no humane skill
or coniecture can iudge. Neither is it lawfull for any man to call him Honourable,
that hath not by vertuous merit acquired some exterior title, or
made proofe of honourable merit either in words or deeds. The signes or
notes of Nobility are these, Notitia, Laus, Ciuilis excellentia, Generositas.
Some learned writers therefore haue said, that Honor consisteth signes
exterior. And Aristotle calleth it, Maximum bonorum exteriorum. Others
affirme, it is a certaine reuerence in testimony of vertue. Lucas de Penna defineth
Honor in these words, Honor est administratio reipub. cum dignitatis
gradu siue cum sumptu, siue sine sumptu. And S. Austen speaking of Honour in
his booke de Ciuitate Dei, which Cicero also in his Offices citeth, sayth, Honos
alit artes, omnes
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         incendimur ad studia gloria. Diuers other definitions of Honour
there are, which for breuitie we omit.
                  Touching the worth or prise of Honour, it ought be valued aboue all
earthly wealth, and is more precious then siluer or gold: and I suppose that
hope of honor and feare of punishment, be the breeders thereof; the one
inciteth mans minde to honest endeuour, the other suppresseth leaud inclination,
and maketh bad motions obedient to reason. Marcus Tullius studying
to restraine the force of audacious youth, ordained by law eight diuers
punishments, calling them damnum, vincula, verbera, talio, ignominia, exilium,
mors, seruitus.
                  
                  But here is to be noted, that Honour and Reuerence are in nature differing:
because reuerence is only the first motiue to honour, which after becommeth
honour absolute. The like difference is betweene honour and
praise, for honour is of it selfe, and in it selfe: but praise ten deth to a further
end. Moreouer, honor is a testimony of excellencie, chiefly in vertue: therfore
according to each mans vertue and merit, honours are bestowed, and
ought not be giuen to the vnworthy: so concluding with Aristotle, I say,
Prauus honore non est dignus.
                  
                  Thus much of Honour and the nature thereof. Now we thinke fitte to
say, that the power and authority to bestow honour resteth onely in the
Prince. For the Law sayth: Honorandus est, quem Princeps honorat: adding,
quem Princeps iudicat dignum, & nos iudicabimus: nam nullus debet esse tantae
superbiae fastigio tumidus, vt regalem sensum contemnat. Cap. de priuilegijs eorum,
qui in sacro palatio militant.
                  
                  It seemeth also expedient to know how men become honoured, and by
what meanes they aspire thereunto: for Aristotle sayth, Honor est praemium
virtutis. Some are also honored for their dignity, as Princes, Prelates, Officers,
and other men of great place or title.
                  Others are honoured for their age or anciencie: and so is it commaunded
in holy Scripture, Coram cano capite consurge, Leu. 19.
                  Others are honoured for their function, as Preachers and Ministers of
the word. And some be honoured for magistracie or authority in the commonweale:
As Casaneus remembreth, That when the sonne of Q. Fabius

Max. was Consul, and sitting in the seat of magistracie, he commanded his
father from his horse being mounted in his presence, according as it was
instituted by the ancient Romans, That no man on horsebacke should approch
the Consul, but for honours sake he should first alight, as Val. Max. in
tit. de Instit. antiquis, reporteth. Fabius therefore beeing so commaunded
from his horse by his sonne, pronounced this most excellent sentence: Nolui
ante iussum tuum descendere, non vt imperium tuum contemnerem, sed vt experirer
an scires consulem agere.
                  
                  Others are honoured as Parents, to whom their children & nephewes
doe owe all duety and obedience: as is commanded in the booke of Prouerbs,
Honora patrem & matrem, vt sis long aeuus super terram, 28.
                  To these, many other causes of Honour may be added, as subiects to honour
their Prince, seruants their masters, inferiours their superiours. And
diuers demonstrations of honour are also due by externall countenance,
words, and gesture; as by attentiue hearing of him that speaketh, by rising
to him that passeth, &c.
                  He that sitteth doth receiue honour from him that standeth: yet a man
of dignity in presence of Iudges ought to sit & not to stand as other common
persons doe, vnlesse his owne cause be pleaded. So sayth Baldus.
                  
                  A man that sitteth at the table is more honoured then hee that serueth,
and he that sitteth on the right hand is more honoured then he that sitteth
on the left hand.
                  He is also honored that sitteth next to the Prince, or neerest to him that
is of greatest dignity. We also account him honored that standeth or walketh
in the mids of two, or a greater number, quia mediocritas in electione loci
maxime probatur.
                  
                  He is likewise reputed most honoured, that sitteth at the chiefe ende, or
in the hiest place of the Table: because the most worthy ought to begin:
which haply moued Virgil to say, A Ioue principium Musae.
                  
                  He is most honoured that walketh next the wall (vnlesse they be three
in number) for then he that is in the mids, is in the worthiest place, as hath
bene formerly said. And he that sitteth next the wall, hath the higher place.
But if three of equall qualitie do walke together, then (for not offering Indignitie
one th'other) sometimes one, and sometimes the other, ought
to take the middle place, which Order the Spaniards and Venetians doe precisely
obserue: affirming the right side to be most Honourable.
                  Among brethren the eldest is alwaies to precede. And so are their wiues
to take place: In pari dignitate. Except by some peculiar dignitie the yonger
be graced.
                  In like maner where many are of one company or fellowship, as in the
Innes of Court, or the Vniuersities, the more ancient is euer most honourable,
and shall precede others, In pari dignitate.
                  
                  Men are also honoured in their diet, for the more honorable the ghest is,
the more delicate ought his fare be. Likewise the apparell of men ought be
differing, according to their degrees, to the end the profession and qualitie
of euery one may be knowen: as an arming Coat best becommeth a Captaine,
a Tippet is seemely for a Priest, a Gowne is meetest for a Scholler, because

eche mans attire ought be like vnto the State, profession, and office
he beareth: as appeareth by that caution which Seneca did giue vnto the
Empresse, mother of Nero. His wordes are these, Indue te, charissima vxor,
delicatè, non propter te, sed propter honorem Imperij.
                  
                  A man is also honoured, when his Prince or other superior is pleased to
salute him by word or writing, or to grace him with gift of any Office or
dignitie.
                  Men are honoured when for any egregious acte, they are permitted to
erect Images of themselues: as Porcius Cato, Horatius Cocles, Mutius Scaeuola
and other notable men were suffered to doe.
                  Men are honoured by drinking in gold, and wearing of purple, also by
being stiled the cousins of Princes.
                  Men are honoured by bearing Armes: For who so hath Armes from
ancesters, is more honourable then he who is the first Gentleman of his
race, and consequently ought be placed in a more worthy seate. Note here
that to euery title of great dignitie, a particular ensigne or ornament is appointed.
An Emperour hath his Diademe or Infula, a King his Crowne, a
Bishop his Mytre, and Archbishop his Mantle, a Doctor his Baretum. As

                        POlydorus in his booke de Inuentoribus rerum lib. 2. cap 3. saith,
That the Ensignes of Romane Kings were Fasces cum securi,

may be called in our English, a bondle of small wands with
an hatchet, a Crowne of gold, a saddle of luory, a kirtle of State, trappings
of horses, robes of State (euer burned with the Kings body) which ornament
was also (after the expulsion of Kings) worne by Consuls and other
Magistrats, who pronounced no sentence, but in that garment. Togae pictae
I suppose were long gownes painted, or wrought l
                        •
                     ke vnto Damaske, or
embroidered about: and Palmatae were garments wrought with Palmetrees
in signe of conquest and peace. It seemeth also that no other Ensigne
of Maiestie, that might illustrate a Kings greatnesse and grauitie was there
wanting. These Kings had also 12▪ 
                     Littori (as we may call them) Sergeants
who caried before them the bondles and Hatchets aforesaid
                  A Diademe, a Crowne, and a Scepter are likewise Ensignes appertayning
to Emperours and Kings. But of Crownes there were anciently diuers
kinds. And Polydor in his booke aforesaid speaketh of many, affirming
that Liber Pater was the first inuentor of Crownes, and ware vpon his head
a Crowne of Iuie. Yet doe we read that Moses (many yeeres before) caused
Crownes of gold to be made, as Iosephus hath written: and of all antiquitie

the Egyptian kings haue had Crownes. Teste Coelio.
                  
                  The first vse of wearing Crownes was in Tragedies and gladiatory combats,
at which time they were made of boughes and trees, afterwards they
were composed of flowers of diuers colours, in the Playes Flo
                        •
                     eall, and in
the Pastoral Comedies also, and by imitation of them, others were framed
of slender barres of tinne, or some other mettall guilded: so as in processe
of time many kinds of Crownes were inuented and much esteemed, chiefly
among the Romanes, and in the time of Consuls.
                  The chiefe Crownes were Militarie, and with them Consuls and generall
Commanders, in their triumphes were crowned. At the beginning
those crownes were made of bayes: which tree sheweth mirth and victorie,
and after of gold.
                  The next they called Corona Muralis, giuen to him that first was seene
vpon the wall of the Enemies towne. This Crowne was also of golde
wrought with certaine battlements like vnto a wall.
                  The third they named Corona Castrensis likewise of gold: being giuen to
him that could breake the wall of the enemie, & enter the towne or castle.
The points of this Crowne was made like Towers.
                  The fourth was Corona Naualis also of gold garnished with forecastles,
giuen to him that by force and vertue first boarded the enemies ship.
                  The fift was Corona Oleaginea bestowed vpon them that were victorious
in the Olympian Playes, or for repulsing the enemie.
                  
                     Corona Oualis was made of Mirtle, and giuen to them that entred a
Towne, taken with litle resistance, or yeelded vpon composition, or when
the warre was proclaimed, or made against slaues or pirats onely.
                  
                     Corona obsidialis was giuen to a Generall leader that had saued his armie
distressed. That Crowne was made of grasse growing where the Armie
was besieged. Such a one the Senate and people of Rome bestowed vpon
Fabius Maximus in the second warre against the Carthagenians.
                  
                     Corona Ciuica was also of high estimation, being giuen to him that saued
a Citizen from the enemie. This Crowne was made of Oaken boughes,
and reputed an ensigne of exceeding honor. Of which opinion Antoninus
Pius seemed to be, saying: Malo vnum ciuem seruare, quàm mille hostes occidere.
                  
                  
                     Corona Haederalis, was giuen to Poets.
Corona Populea was giuen to yong men industrious and disposed to vertuous
endeuour.
                  Other ensignes Militarie the Romanes vsed, and were bestowed in token
of dignitie: as chaines of gold, gilt spurres, launces, and white rods, the
one a token of warre, the other of peace. We will also speake of Crownes
of later deuice giuen to great Estates.

                  Of Emperors.
                  
                     
                        IMperator dicitur quasi Imperij Rator fortasse, vt legislator. Ita

                         maiestatem habens,
non armis solum munitam, sed & legibus moderatam. The name
of Emperour was first in vse among the Romanes, and by
them inuented, not for Princes, but chiefe Leaders and
Captaines of the warre. At the beginning they were yerely created in
Ianuary, and ended their authority in September: which custome continued
vntill the Battell of Pharsalia, wherein Pompei was defeated by Caesar:
who being returnened to Rome, the Romanes consented he should enioy
that title of Emperour during his life; the which his nephew Octauian,
succeding him in the Empire continued and made it hereditary to his successors,
with the surname of Augustus, for his happy gouernment: which
name hath bene euer since vsed by all Emperours to this day. So appeareth
it that the title of Emperor began in Rome, Anno mundi 3914. or as others
say 3963 ab vrbe condita 706. And before the birth of Christ 47.
                  This Emperor and his successors continued their seate at Rome vntill
the reigne of Constantine the great, Anno Christi 310. by whom the Emperiall
Court was transferred to Constantinople. So the Empire became diuided
into two Empires, one Emperour gouerned at Constantinople in the
East, the other at Rome in the West. Which order continued from the
reigne of Carolus magnus vntill Constantinus Paleologus. In whose time Constantinople
was besieged, and taken by the Turkes.
                  The West Empire after the death of Charlemaine, hath in diuers ages
bene gouerned by Princes of diuers nations, as Frenchmen, Saxons, Sueuians,
and Austrians, who presently hold that dignitie.
                  In the reigne of Otho 3. (with the consent of Pope Gregory 5.) the election
of the Emperour was taken from the Italians, and granted vnto seuen
Princes of Germany, viz. the Archbishops of Mentz▪ Treuer, and Colein, the
Count Palatin of Rheine, the Duke of Saxon, the Marquesse of Brandenburg,
and the King of Bohemia, then called Duke of Bohemia. This order was after
confirmed in the reigne of Charles the fourth, about the yeere 1378.
                  Among Princes secular, an Emperor hath anciently bene reputed worthy
a chiefe place, and to precede all other Princes, which is the cause
that Baldus called an Emperour the Vicar or Vicegerent of God vpon
earth: and therefore when other Princes are crowned with one onely
Crowne, an Emperor hath euer had three.
                  The first Crowne is of iron, which he receiueth at Aquisgran, by the
hand of the Archbishop of Colein, within whose Diocesse that Citie is
seated.
                  
                     
The second Crowne is of siluer, which hee taketh at the hand of the
Archbishop of Milan, in the Citie of Modena, after he is arriued in Italy. Yet
true it is, that the Emperour Henrie receiued it at Milan in S. Ambrose
Church: and haply so haue some other Emperors. Siluer signifieth cleannesse
and brightnesse. Yet some writers haue sayd, the first Crowne is of
siluer, and the second of iron, which Cass. denieth.
                  The third Crowne is of pure golde, wherewith
he is crowned at Rome by the Pope, in the
Church of S. Peter, before the Altar of S. Mauriee.
Gold is accompted the most excellent of
all mettals, and of such perfection in Iustice
Emperors and Princes ought be. In these three
mettals all Tributes and other dueties were anciently
payd vnto Emperors.
                  
                     
At the Inauguration and Coronation of an
Emperor, putting vpon him his mantell, these
words are pronounced, viz. Thou oughtest to
burne in the zeale of faith, and so long as thou doest
liue, endeuour to preserue peace.
                  
                  When the Scepter and sword are deliuered into his hand, it is likewise
said vnto him: viz. By these signes thou art admonished to correct subiects with
a fatherly chastisement, extending thy hand of mercie, first vnto the ministers of
God, and next to widowes, and fatherlesse children: so shall the oyle of mercie neuer
fall from thy head, and both in this world, and the world to come, thou shalt be
rewarded with an euerlasting crowne.

For the better conceiuing of that which followeth,
it shall not be impertinent to know, that Kings,
Princes, and other soueraigne Commanders, did in the
beginning) aspire vnto greatnes by puissance and force:
of which number Cain was the first, as Austen lib. 15. de ciuitate Dei cap. 20.
writeth. This Cain to the end he might with more commoditie command
his people, builded a citie, calling it by his sonnes name Enoch: and was
the first citie in the world, as appeareth in Genes. cap. 4.
                  After the flood, the first King that raigned, was Nimrod descended of
the line of Cham, as we find in Gen. 9. whose sonne builded the Tower of
Babel, intending to make the same of height equall to the heauen. But the
Lord offended with his ambition inspired the people to speake in diuers
languages, for before that time, all men had onely one tongue, Gen. cap. 9.
                  
                     
These and other Princes were oppressors of people, and displeasing to
God, for which cause they receiued vnfortunate ende. The first King
of Barbary, exercising the arte Magike was slaine by the deuill. In like
manner other ancient Monarkes raigning tyrannically, ended their liues
by violence. As Pharaoh (whose heart being hardned against the Lord) was
drowned in the red sea, Exod. 14. Also Corah, Dathan, and Abiram, swallowed
vp by the earth, Numb. 16. Antiochus eaten of lice, 2. Mac. 9. Saul the first
King of Israel, disobedient to Dauid, and other ministers of the Lord, was
wounded of the Philistims, and in the end desperately stabbed himselfe to
death with his owne sword, 1. Kings. 31. And Absalon the sonne of Dauid,
rebelling against his father, was slaine by Ioab, 1. King. 14.
                  Too long it were to tell by how many meanes the Almighty Lord hath
punished the vngodly and impious oppressors of people, and with what
power and grace he hath protected those Kings & Princes that gouerned
with Iustice, & maintained people in peace: for indeede there is no power
but from God, as Christ speaking to Pilat said: Non haberes potestatem aduersum
me vllam, nisi datum tibi esset desuper. Ioh. 19. It appeareth also that
good Princes doe deserue diuine honour, as S. Austen seemeth to affirme.
And the Apostle in his Epistle to Timothy saith. Qui bene praesunt, duplici
honore dignisunt. Good and godly Kings therfore haue receiued from God
diuine vertue aboue all other creatures. As was scene in Saul: who being
made King by Samuel foorthwith became inspired with the gift of Prophecie,
and the Spirit of God did enter into him, whereby he prophecied
with other Prophets. 1. King. cap. 10.
                  We reade likewise that Salomon being created King, obtayned the excellencie
of wisedome, 1. King. 3.
                  If seemeth also that Kings, are diuinely inspired with diuers other parttcular
graces and vertues: as the kings of England and
France (by touching only) do cure an infirmity called
The Kings euill, & the Kings of Spaine (as some writers
affirme) haue power to cast diuels out of mēs bodies.
                  
                      Kings anciently were crowned with crownes floreall:
but at this day, their crowes are both floreall
and Archall, with an Orbe and Crosse.

                     NExt and neerest vnto the King, his Queene is to take place,
because the weareth a Regall Crowne, which no other person
but a King may doe.
                  It seemeth also that a Queene ought to sit on the Kings
right hand: which honour the sacred Scriptures do allow,

                     Psal. 45. Astitit Regina à dextris tuis in vestitu deaurato. And if she be a mayden
Queene Soueraigne, and absolute, shee is In pari dignitate with a
King, & may precede him also according to the dignitie of her kingdome.
And if she be a Queene of three entiere kingdomes (as our Soueraigne is)
she may assume the title of an Empresse.
                  Also Officers and ministers appertaining vnto a Queene absolute, are
priuiledged equall with the Officers of Kings, and may take place accordingly
Lu de Pen. Ca. de priuilegijs.
                  
                  Note also that albeit a Queene be the daughter of a Duke or an Earle,
or any other inferior degree, yet shall she be called Queene by the dignitie
of her husband. And if she be the daughter of a King, superior to her husband,
then may she also reteine the dignitie of her fathers daughter. Iac. Rebuff.
& alij dig▪ lib. 12. which was the reason that the Lady Claudia daughter
vnto King Lewis the 12. did take place before the Lady Loysia of Sauoy,
notwithstanding shee was mother to King Francis the first. So did the
daughter precede the mother.
                  Yet some doe hold that a Kings mother ought be preferred before all others:
alleaging the Text, Positus est thronus matris iuxta thronum Regis, the
3. of Kings. We reade also in the same place, that King Solomon beholding
his mother comming towards him, adored her, and caused a Throne to be
set on his right hand. Which seemeth indeede to be her place, in absence
of the Queene, not otherwise: as mine Author writeth.

themselues in giuing light, heat and comfort, vnto all liuing
things, without any dimunition of his proper vertue,
either in substance, course, or brightnesse: so from the sacred
power, and Regall authoritie of Emperours, Kings,
and Queenes, all earthly dignities doe proceed, yet their
owne Princely and soueraigne power In sua prima sublimitate doth not suffer
or sustaine any blemish or detriment.
                  The first place and chiefest, degree therefore (after the Estates aforenamed)
appertaineth vnto the Prince, or eldest sonne of the King, in respect
he is the first borne childe of his father, and may claime to sit on the right
hand, as Baldus seemeth to affirme, saying, Primogenitus sedet ad dextram patris,
by imitation of the Christian beleefe.
                  Note that the eldest sonne of a King hath euer a title of greater dignitie,
then his other brethren, viz. In England hee is called Prince of Wales, in
France the Dolphin, in Spaine, L' Infante, &c.

he is borne Duke of Cornewall, and therefore needeth no ducall creation:
when he is made Prince, he is presented before the King in Princely
robes,
who putteth about his necke a sword bendwise, a cap and Coronet
ouer his head, a ring ouer his middle finger, a verge of gold in his hand, and
his Letters pattents after they be read.
                  The second place is due vnto the first sonne of the Kings eldest sonne.
So as the nephew seemeth to precede the vncle, which hath bene a question
of great difficultie, and left vnto triall of the sword. Yet in France it hath
bene diuers times, diuersly iudged, but for the most part in fauour of the
Nephew. And in England the Nephew was preferred before the Vncle, as
Baldus noteth.
               
               
                  CHAP. 8.
                  An Archduke.
                  
                     
                     THe thirde place belongeth vnto
the Kings brothers, Vncles, and
Nephewes, who are reputed as
Archdukes, because they precede
all other Dukes, being not of the
blood Royall: yet haue I not read or heard, that
euer any such dignitie hath bene in England, by
the name of Archduke. This title is of highest note in the Empire, and proper
onely to the house of Austria. For as Archbishops are preferred before
all other Bishops, in respect of the word Archos, id est, Princeps Episcoporum,
so it seemeth the Archduke may reasonably claime place before all other
Dukes.
                  Some hold opinion that this title of Archduke may be assumed by the
eldest brother of euery Ducall family in Germany, & hath bene by custome
so vsed, as a title of greatest dignitie among brethren.
                  But Tillet saith, that in France, when any great Duke had the conduct of
an Armie, and thereby commanded other Dukes vnder him, then was hee
called Duke of France, that is to say, Duke of Dukes. The which office for
that it had so great a superintendencie, was afterward called Meyer du Pallays.
This Meyer or Maior, had the authoritie of a Vice-Roy, and commanded
in all causes both Military and Ciuil.
                  To this degree of Archduke belongeth a Surcoat, a Mantle, and a hood
of Crimsin veluet, wherewith he is inuested at his Creation, he hath also a
Chapeau or Ducal cap doubled Ermin indented, with a Coronet about the
same, and one arch of gold with an Orbe, hee also beareth a Verge or rod
of gold.

                  A Duke.
                  
                     
                     THe fourth degree in Precedencie is
a Duke, who at the first was euer a
Leader of an Armie Emperial or
Regal: He was called Dux à ducendo,
quia ob suam fortitudinem & magnanimitatem
per se exercitum ducere dignus erat. He
was anciently chosen in the field, either by casting of Lots, or common
voyce. The Saxons (before their conquest) called this Leader an Hertzog,
and was afterwards taken for the Constable of England, whose office was to
be chiefe Leader of the Kings battel. But the trueth is, that during the turbulent
state of conquering, and wandring Nations, their degrees of Dukes
were in chiefest force; But since Kingdomes and Principalities haue bene
settled, they are become onely dignities giuen by Emperours, Kings and
Princes, to men of great blood or excellent merit.
                  These Dukes are ornified with a Surcoat, Mantle, and Hood: at their
Creation they weare also a Ducall cap doubled Ermin, but not indented.
They haue also a Coronet, and Verge of gold.
                  Note here that in England all Dukes of the Kings blood, as his sonne,
brother, vncle, or nephew, ought be reputed as Archdukes, and precede
all other Dukes.
                  Note also, that hee who is a Duke tantùm, shall take place before any
Lord that is both a Marquesse and an Earle, notwithstanding they be two
dignities But he that is a Duke and Marquesse, or a Duke and an Earle, shal
march before a Duke tantùm.

                  A Marquesse.
                  
                     THe fift estate is a Marquesse, called
by the Saxons, A Marken
Reue, that is to say, a Ruler of the
Marches. This great Officer (in
the Kings battaile) was chiefe
Captaine of the Horse campe, and next it authoritie
vnto the He
                           •
                        tzog or Constable, so that it should seeme he was in
degree, as our High Marshall is in England.
                  To this estate is due a Surcoat, Mantle, and Hood, with a Coronet of
golde Fleury.

                  An Earle.
                  
                     
                     THe sixt in Precedency is an Earle,
which the Saxons called an Elderman.
id est, Iudex. He for grauitie
in counsell was called Comes Illustris,
à comitando Principem: or as
some say, à comitiua, quia dignus est sua strenuitate
ducere comitiuam in bello, & ipsam sua animi fortitudine regere, & defendere.
The dignitie of Earles is of diuers kindes: for an Earle acknowledging no
superiour, is equall to a Prince; but if he acknowledge a superior, he is but
in degree with a Generall. And as Earles for their vertues and heroicall
qualities, are reputed Princes, or companions vnto Princes: so ought they
(according to their calling) to be richly apparelled, honourably followed,
and serued, and with badges of honour, titles, and princely ceremonies to
be euer dignified.
                  In the Empire at this day are sundry sorts of Earles, which they call
Graues: as Landgraues, id est, regionum Comites. Margraues, id est, certarum
marcarum seu districtuum vel agri, ciuitatis, aut regionis alicuius finium Comites.
Palatins, qui sunt Iudices regni edomiti. Burgraues, quasi 
                           〈◊〉
                         Comites.
Rheingraues, qui praesunt rusticis.
                  
                  In the Court Imperiall, Comes was anciently the title of sundry officers:
as Comes Largitionum, Comes laborum, Comes Consistorianus, Comes Palatij. Comes
Palaij had Iura Regalia, and thereby might erect Barons vnder them,
as Hugh Lupus first Count Palatin of Chester made eight Barons, and had
that Earledome giuen vnto him by the Conqueror: ita liberè ad Gladium,
sicut ipse Rex tenebat Angliam ad Coronam.
                  
                  The Countie of Lancaster was made County Palatine by King Edward
the third, and had Barons, Chancerie, and Seale, & so had the Bishopricks
of Durham and Ely. The Offices of these Barons were to sit in Councell
and Parliament with the Earle in his Pallace, and to honor his Court with
their presence. Also for more magnificence, these Earles kept their Grandiours,
and festiuall dayes, as absolute Princes in their prouinces.
                  
                     Comes Marescallus Angliae, is an Earle by office, and so is no other Earle
of England but hee: he is in the vancancie of the Constable, the Kings lieutenant
Generall in all marshall affaires. His office is of great commandement,
and endued with many honourable priuiledges. King Rich. the second
in the 21. of his reigne granted to Thomas Holland Duke of Surrey
Earle Marshal of England, Quod idem Dux ratione officij sui habeat, gerat, &
deferat quendā baculū aureum, circa vtrum

quod aliquis alius ante haec tempora, baculum ligneum portare consueuerit.
                  
                  To the degree of an Earle belongeth a Surcoat, a Mantle, and a Hood,
with a Coronet of gold with points only, and no flowers.

                  A Vicount.
                  
                     
                     A Vicount is in degree & dignity next
vnto an Erle: it was anciently a name
of Office vnder an Earle, and called
Vicecomes or Subcomes; and this office
was to heare and determine causes of
difference, and to execute Iustice in the Earles County. The Saxons called
him the Shyre-Reue, and in the Norman speech Vicount. Hee is of greater
dignity then a Baron: as is the Vicount de Thureyn, and the Vicount of Combre
in Fraunce; or as the Vicounts Mountacute, and Vicount Howard of Bindon
in England. This degree hath a Surcoat, a Mantle, and a Hood, and a
Circulet without either Floures or Points, as appeareth in the Margent.
               
               
                  CHAP. 13.
                  A Baron.
                  
                     NExt ensueth a Baron, which dignity was called in the British
tongue Dynast, in the Saxon Thayn, in Latine Baro,
which signifieth Vir grauis: for Albertus de Rosa in his Dictionary
expressing the signification of the word Baro, sayth:
Barones dicuntur graues personae, à Graeco vocabulo Baria, quod
idem est quod autoritas grauis. Likewise Calap. in his Dictionary sayth, Baro
est vir fortis, à quo fit diminutiuum Barunculus. Men in this dignity were euer
of great reputation; for Hortensius speaking of Barons (whome Dominicus
de S. Gemi. calleth also Capitanius) sayth, Non solum militare, sed prudenter
atque grauiter ipsis ducibus consulere officium est Baronis.
                  
                  Barons were also anciently accounted companions to Earls and others
of higher dignity, and therefore reckoned of that number, called Peeres, or
Pares regni, or Pares homines, of some men pronounced Parhomines, and corruptly
Barones, conuerting the letter P. into B. as Libard for Leopard.
                  
                  The dignitie of a Baron is thus defined. Baronia est quaedam dignitas inter
nobiles, habens quandam praeeminentiam inter solos simplices nobiles, post principatus,
ex consuetudine introductam, & ex quodam mod
                           •
                         vtendi diuer simode diuersas
patrias▪ Cass.
                  
                  It seemeth also that a Baron in diuers Countreys is diuersly esteemed:
for in England they are to proceede according to their segniority; but in
Burgundy they be reputed the greatest Barons that are of greatest possessions.
And as a Duke had anciently vnder him ten Earles or Earledomes,

and an Earle 10 Baronies, so a Baron ought be commander of some competent
company of Segniories, & the greater the number be, the more his
honour. Quanto maiora qu
                           ••
                        tractat, tanto ipse maior est. Dauid. Likewise Salustius
in his Prooeme of Catelin sayd, Maxima gloria, in maximo Imperio.
                  
                  In the kingdome of Naples all Gentlemen hauing iurisdiction appertaining
to their lands and castels, are called Barons: yet in diuers places of
France no Segniory is reputed a Barony, vnlesse it hath belonging vnto it
foure Castels, one Hospital, one Colledge with a Chruch: hauing also a
Seale autentike: Which dignitie is preferred before the title of Gentlemen,
yet is inferiour to all Countiships: such is the opinion of Cassaneus,
lib. 8.
                  One other degree of great estate and titular dignity there is, called Princes:
although in England I haue not seene or read of any such in that kind
yet where that title is in vse, they precede Barons: Some of them haue Iuraregalia,
and therefore do hold that dignitie either by custome or priuiledge:
as the princes of Orange, Piedemont, and Achaia haue Iura regalia. But
others do hold that title by custome, which is of great force, as Baldus affirmeth
saying, Consuetudini standum erit.
                  
                  A Baron hath not Potestatem Principis, yet is he numbred among noble
personages, and some Barons (by reason of their Baronies) haue so much
authority ouer their owne vassals as if they conspire against them, that offence
is called treason, in respect whereof, the title of Baron is so much
the more honourable.
                  Note that a Baron hauing Iura Imperialia or Iura Regalia, is reputed equal
vnto an Earle, notwithstanding the Earldome, or Barony doe differ in
dignity.
                  Note also, that Barons doe participate of diuers priuiledges and Immunities
proper vnto other dignities aforesayd; they are Lords of the Parliament
in England, and of them it is called the Barons Court. For the Parliament
makes not Barons, but Barons Parliaments.
                  The title of Barons in France, was (anciently) generall, aswel to Princes
of blood, as all others holding immediatly of the Crowne So do we cal
the greatest estates of England by the names of Barons, Lords Spiritual,
and Temporall. Of Barons in England there hath bene also anciently diuers
sorts. Some were Barons in name, but not noble, as the Barons of the
fiue Ports, and Barons of London whom Bracton maketh mention of in
these words, Coram Baronibus London. And in another place, Sicut Barones
London coràm me testantur. The Barons of the Exchequer are of like condition.
                  Other Barons both in name and dignitie, yet not called honorable,
were Barons created by the Earles Palatines.
                  Of Barons honourable, are three degrees, viz. by Tenure, by Creation,
and by Writ.
                  Barons by Tenure, are Bishops chiefly caled Lords Spiritual, and euer
reputed honorable, not in respect of noblenes in blood, but for their function
and office, they are Peeres and Barons of the Realme. They are also
first in nomination, and take place on the Princes right hand in the Parliament

chamber. They are also called Right honourable Lords, and Reuerent
Fathers in God. They haue bene likewise capable of Temporal dignities,
as Baronies, and Earledomes. Some of them be accounted Counts
Palatine in their proper iurisdiction.
                  Barons by writ, are summoned by their proper surnames, as A. B. Cheualier,
although (indeede) he be no Knight. And all those Barons so called
by writ, the dignitie is inuested in their owne sirname, and so in their owne
persons, and not in their Castles, Houses, Manors, or Lordships.
                  Barons by creation, are either solemnely created by another name, then
their owne, as in the right of their wiues or mothers. Or els by the names
of some Castle, House, Manor, or Lordship.
                  In which diuersities although Barons be diuersly made, yet are they all
alike in their callings, and though in shew some of their dignities be of a
place certaine, yet is the right dignitie in the person of the Baron. For admit
a Baron should 
                        •
                     ell, or exchange the place, whereof he is called, yet shal
he still holde the name, and be written and reputed thereby, and haue his
place, and voyce in Parliament by the same name hee was first called or
created.
                  Of Knights and Knighthood we haue at large discoursed in the second
Booke, only this is to be remēbred that the forme of dubbing of Knights,
both in warre and peace, is not now obserued, as it hath bene: Nam Milites
tunica suorum armorum, & torque indui, gladio cingt, & calcaribus auratis ornarisolebant,
and the Prince in the action thereof pronounced these words:
Soyez loyal Chlr. en nom de Dieu, & S. George.
                  
                  Miles dicitur, quasi vnus electus ex mille, olim inter Romanos mille homines
strenui & maximè bellicosi electiinter caeteros fuerunt, & quilibet eorum dictus
fuit miles, quasi vnus ex mille.

                  Of Esquiers.
                  
                     AN Esquier or Escuier (commonly called Squier) is he that
was antiently called Scutiger, and to this day in the latine is
named Armiger. These men, as sir Thomas Smith in his booke
de Rcip. Anglorum, doth describe them▪ are Gentlemen bearing
armes, or armories, as the French do call it, in testimony
of the Nobilitie or race from whence they are come. Esquiers be taken
for no distinct order of the common weale, but goe with the residue of
Gentlemen: saue that (as hee thinketh) they be those men who beare
Armes, in signe (as I haue said) of the race and familie whereof they are
descended. In respect whereof they haue neither creation nor dubbing,
vnlesse it be such as hold office by the Princes gift and receiue a collar of
SS. Or els they were at the first, costrels or bearers of the Arm
                        •
                      of Lords

or Knights, and by that had their name for a dignitie and honour, giuen to
distinguish them from common Souldiers, called in Latine Gregarij milites.
So is euery Esquier a Gentleman, but euery Gentleman not an Esquier,
vnlesse he be such a one as beareth Armes, which Armes are giuen either
by the Prince, as a testimonie of fauour, or a signe of his vertue that receiued
them, or both: either else by donation of the Kings of Armes, who by
the Princes Commandement or Commission haue authoritie at their discretion
to bestow such honour, with consent of the Earle Marshall.
                  
                     Somerset Glouer, that learned Herauld, maketh foure definitions, or seuerall
sorts of Esquiers according to the custome of England.
                  
                  The first of them, and the most ancient, are the eldest sonnes of Knights,
and eldest sonnes of them successiuely.
                  The second sort, are the eldest sonnes of the younger sonnes of Barons,
and Noble men of higher degree, which take end, & are determined when
the chiefe Masles of such elder sonnes doe faile, and that the inheritance
goeth away with the heires females▪
                  
                  The third sort are those, that by the King are created Esquiets by the
gift of a Collar of SS. and such bearing Armes are the principall of that
coat Armour, and of their whole race, out of whose families although diuers
other houses doe spring and issue, yet the eldest of that coat Armour
onely is an Esquier, and the residue are but Gentlemen.
                  The fourth and last sort of Esquiers are such, as bearing office in the
common weale, or in the Kings house, are therefore called and reputed to
be Esquiers, as the Serieants at the Lawe, the Escheators in euery shire,
and in the Kings house, the Serieant of euery Office: but hauing no Armes,
that degree dieth with them, and their issue is not ennobled thereby.
                  
                     Mounsieur P. Pithou, in his memories of the Earles of Champagne, and
Brie saith further, that among the Fiefes of Normandy, the Fiefe called
Fiefe de Haubert, was that which in Latine is Feuda Loricae, or Feuda Scutiferorum
the very originall of the name of our Esquiers, comming of the
Armes, and seruice which they ought to Knights, for they helde their
land of a Knight by Scutage, as a Knight helde his land of the King,
by Knights seruice. And such Fiefes were called Vray Vassaulx, being
bound alwayes to serue their Lorde (by reason of their Fiefe) without
pay.
                  There are also in England other sorts of Esquiers, which courtesie and
custome haue made, among which they are reputed Esquiers that are able
at the Musters to present a Launce, or light horse, for the Princes seruice,
not vnlike the manner of the Spaniardes, where all freehoulders are
called Caualieros, that doe keepe horse for the Kings impolyments.

                  Of Gentlemen.
                  
                     GEntlemen are they who in the Greeke are called Eugeneis,
in Latine Nobiles or Ingenui, in the French Nobles, in the
English Gentlemen. Gens in Latine betokeneth a race, a sirname,
or family: as the Romans had Traquinij, Valerij, Quintij,
Claudij, Cincinnati, Fabij, Cossi, and such like: so haue we
in England certaine names, which for their continuance in reputation,
vertue, and riches, may be in Latine called Agnati or Gentiles, that is, men
knowen, or Gentlemen of this or that name and family. But let vs consider
how this Nobility is defined, and by how many meanes men doe thereunto
aspire.
                  
                     Iudocus Clicthouius defineth Nobilitie thus: Nobilitas est generis velalterius
rei excellentia ac dignitas, Tract. Nobil. Cap. 1. Nobility is the excellencie
of gentle race, or of some other good quality. And Bartholus discoursing
long, whether Nobilitie and Dignity be but one, concludeth they are
not: yet (said he) the one resembleth the other, Lib. 1. Cap. de Dig. adding,
That as he to whome God hath vouchsafed his grace, is before his diuine
Maiesty, noble; so before men, who so is fauoured by his Prince or the
Lawes, ought be receiued for noble. This Nobilitie therefore is thus defined:
Nobilitas est qualitas illata per Principatum tenentem, qua quis vltra acceptos
plebeios honestus ostenditur: Nobility is a title bestowed by him that holdeth
place of the Prince, and maketh him that receiueth it to be of better
reputation then other men.
                  Of Nobilitie (or as we call it Gentilitie) diuers diuisions by diuers men
haue bene. Bartholus sayth, That of Nobility there are three kinds, viz. Nobilitas
theologica seu supernaturalis, Nobilitas naturalis, Nobilitas politica.
                  
                  The first is a certaine Nobilitie knowen to God only: and they that be
so ennobled, be noble for integrity and vertue.
                  The second Nobility may be considered in two respects, as Bartholus affirmeth:
For, both creatures vnreasonable and they that are senslesse may
(in some sort) be called Noble, as we see Birds euen of one Espece or kind,
some prooue noble and some ignoble; as of Falcons, some are Gentle and
some Haggard. Likewise of fourefooted beasts, some are Noble, as the Lyon;
some ignoble, as the Wolfe: which Ouid in his booke de Tristibus well
expresseth:

                        Quo quisque est maior, magis est placabilis irae,
                        Et faciles motus mens generosa capit.
                        Corpora magnanimo satis est prostrasse Leoni,
                        Pugna suum finem, cum iacet hostis, habet.
                        At Lupus, & turpes instant morientibus Vrsi,
                        Et quaecunque minor nobilitate fera est.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     Politica nobilitas, is that honour which the Prince giueth: as hath bene
formerly said.
                  
                     Aristotle in his 4. booke of Politikes maketh foure kindes of Nobility,
viz. Diuitiarum, Generis, Virtutis, & Disciplinae: that is, noble by riches, noble
by ancestors, noble for vertue, and noble for learning. But leauing to
say more concerning the qualitie of Nobility, let vs returne to those persons
that we formerly called priuate or simple Gentlemen. We say therefore
that they ought be preferred before all other men without dignity,
whensoeuer any comparison is made. For this word Gentleman or Nobilis,
id est, nos cibilis, is a name of preheminence to distinguish men of vertue
from base people. We read in holy Scripture, how Moses constituted
certaine Iudges, and called them Sapientes and Nobiles, Deut. 1. Samuel was
also called Nobilis for his excellencie in prophecying. It is likewise in Eccles.
Beata terra cuius Rex nobilis est. And Aristot. in his Polit. sayth, Nobilitas
apud omnes in honore habetur. And Seneca sayth, Habet hoc proprium generosus
animus, quod concitatur ad honesta. Now for so much as Nobility or Generositie
is the first degree or steppe whereby men ascend to greater dignity,
it seemeth fit to be enformed how that title is acquired. We say therefore,
that some are Gentlemen by blood of Ancestours, as appeareth in the
booke of Wisd 3. Gloria hominis ex honore patris sui, & contumelia filij pater
sine honore. Also, Gloria filiorum parentes eorum, Prou. 18. Yet is this to be vnderstood,
that the worde Parentes signifieth the Nobilitie of fathers, not of
mothers, as Bal. affirmeth Cap. de Seruis fugiti. Of which opinion Cicero in
his Offices seemeth to be, saying, Optima haereditas à patribus traditur liberis,
omnis
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                        , patrimonio praestantior gloria virtutis, rerum
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         gestarum.
                  
                  Secondly men are made Noble for wisdome: for in true wisdome Nobility
consisteth, Sap. 7. And Prudence ought bee preferred before all riches,
yea nothing desirable can be thereunto compared, Prou 8.
                  Thirdly men are aduanced for learning in the Lawes Ciuil: hereof it
commeth, that Doctors of Law are to be honoured so highly, as no other
man (how honourable soeuer) shall presume to call them Fratres, but Domini,
Le. 1. Cod. Yet Bonus de Curtili in his treatise of Nobility sayth, That in
the opinion of Bartolus, knowledge or learning doth not make a Gentleman,
vnlesse hee be dignified with the title of Doctor, or graced by some
office of reputation, and if that be taken away, he shalbe reputed a common
person.
                  Item, men placed in Offices Iudicial, are thereby made noble: for euery
Iudge ought be reputed a Gentleman in regard of his Office. Also euery
officer vnder the Prince, I meane, hauing any Office of honor or worship, is
therby made a Gentleman. Dignitas & nobilitas idem sunt Bart de Dig li. 12.
                  Item, men become noble for vertue, and chiefly Iustice: which moued
Lucas de Penna to define Nobilitie thus, Nobilitas nihil aliud est, quàm habitus
operatioque virtutis, in homine. And another old writer summarily saith,

                        Nobilitas hominis, est mens Deitatis Imago.
                        Nobilitas hominis, virtutum clara propago.
                        Nobilitas hominis, humilem releuare iacentem.
                        Nobilitas hominis, mentem refrenare furentem.
                        
                           
Nobilitas hominis, nisi turpia nulla timere,
                        Nobilitas hominis, Naturae 
                              •
                           ura tenere.
                     
                  
                  Item, if any common person by his vertue or fortune doe chance to be
made a Duke, and Earle, a Baron, or do aspire to any other dignitie of honor
or worship, he thereby becommeth a Gentleman. Or if he be made a Captaine
of a Countrey or castle, hauing pension or fee appertaining thereunto,
he ought be a Gentleman: For which reason, euery man of dignitie is a
Gentleman.
                  Item, they are Nobilitated to whom the Prince granteth any honorable
Fee farme, Pension, or intertainement for life: chiefly if the same be ancient.
Quoniam feodum nobile nobilitat suum possessorem. And that Fee is indeed ancient
and Honourable, which by custome is vsed to be giuen by the Prince
to Gentlemen onely, and if the same be granted to any ignoble person, that
donation doeth not presently make the receiuer noble: Quoniam nobilitas
ictu oculi non nascitur. Bal. Praeludij Feodorū Lucas de Penna saith, that if a Yeoman
do buy an honorable Fee, he shal not thereby become a Gentleman.
The reason therof is, Res à persona sumit cōditionem, & honorē, & non e contra.
                  
                  Item, by common opinion some ignoble persons are called Gentlemen.
Of these the number is infinite, yet are they not indeed Noble, but vulgarly
so esteemed: as Lucas de Penna saith.
                  Item, men are ennobled by the Princes grant, as Baldus affirmeth, Yet if
a simple subiect, being made a Gentleman, doe not exercise the qualities
beseeming that dignitie, he ought be depriued of that title: Or if hee conuerse
with base men, or apparell himselfe and his wife in garments vnfit for
their degree, they shall not be accompted Noble. Quia habitus demonstrat
qualitatem & dignitatem personae deferentis. And as these persons made Gentlemen,
in not exercising the professions of that degree, doe loose the benefit
thereof: So Captaines and Souldiers discontinuing the warre, doe by
Law loose their reputation. Milites not exercentes militiam, non gaudent
priuilegijs militum. Bal. in lib. 1. Cod.
                  
                  Item men may sometimes become Noble in respect of the place where
they were borne: For the Citizens of famous Townes may reasonably be
thought more worthy then villaines. Yet if a Gentleman doe inhabite his
village, he shall neuerthelesse continue Noble. Quia nobilis à rustico, non loco,
sed genere distinguitur.
                  
                  Item, all men in the princes ordinary seruice and houshold are thereby
ennobled, and ought be Gentlemen. The words 
                        〈◊〉
                      the Law be these. Omnes
famulantes principi sunt in dignitate & ideo nobiles: cum dignitas & nobilitas
idem sunt. Bart. lib. 1. Ca. de Dignit. 12.
                  Item, some Gentlemen doe hold that dignitie by prescription, not hauing
other proofe, then that they and their ancestors were called Gentlemen
time out of minde. And for this reason it seemeth that Nobilitie the
more ancient it is, the more commendable, chiefly if the first of such families
were aduanced for vertue. Which Nobilitie is that whereof Aristotle
meaneth, saying, Nobilitas est maiorum quaedam claritas honorabilis progenitorum.
Likewise Boetius de Con. saith, Nobilitas est quaedam laus proueniens de
merito parentum.
                  
                  
                     
Item, Nobilitie is oft times gotten by mariage; for if a Gentleman doe
marrie a woman of base parentage, she is thereby ennobled. Text est in leg.
in mulieres Ca de dig.
                  
                  Item, of riches (chiefly if they be ancient) men be called noble; for commonly
no man is accompted worthy much honour, or of great trust and
credit, vnlesse he be rich; according to the old saying,

                        In pretio pretium nunc est, dat census honores,
                        Census amicitias, pauper vbique iac
                              •
                           t.
                     
                  
                  Yet Seneca saith, Id laudandum est quod ipsius est. Neuerthelesse, Bonus de Curtili
accordeth with the common opinion, saying, Nobilitas sine diuitijs mortua
est,
                  
                  Item, men be made noble for their seruice in warre, if therein they haue
acquired any charge honorable. For no ordinarie Souldier without place
of commandement is reputed a Gentleman, vnlesse he were so borne, as
Lucas de Penna sayth, Simplex militia dignitatem non habet.
                  
                  Item Doctors and Graduates in Schooles, do merit to be ennobled and
become Gentlemen.
                  Item, in England whoso studieth liberal Sciences in the Vniuersities, or
is accounted learned in the common Lawes, and for the most part, who so
can liue idlely, and without manual labour, or will beare the port, charge,
and countenance of a Gentleman, shalbe called Master (for that is the title
which men giue to Esquires and other Gentlemen) and shall be taken for
a Gentleman. For true it is with vs, Tanti eris alijs, quanti tibi fueris. So
doth it appeare, that (in England) the King needeth not to make Gentlemen,
because euery man may assume that title, or buy it better cheape,
then by suite to the Prince, or by expence in his seruice. And who so can
make proofe, that his Ancestors or himselfe, haue had Armes, or can procure
them by purchase, may be called Armiger or Esquier. Such men are
called sometime in scorne Gentlemen of the first head, as Sir Thomas Smith
pleasantly writeth.

                  How Gentlemen are to take place.
                  
                     A Gentleman that hath two or three titles, shall precede him
that is a Gentleman onely. As a Doctor being also a Gentle
man borne, shall precede all other Doctors of meaner
birth. Likewise a Gentleman Graduate shall take place
before him that is a Graduate tantùm. But this is to bee vnderstood:
Data paritate temporis.
                  
                  A Gentlemen that is both a Knight and a Doctor, shall goe before him
that is a Knight or a Doctor tantùm.
                  
                  A Gentleman well qualified, and well borne, shal precede a Gentlemen

of good qualitie or of good birth tantùm. Quia duplex dignitas fulget in eo,
propria, & suorum.
                  
                  A Gentleman ennobled, for learning vertue and good manners, is to be
preferred before a Gentleman borne, and rich. Quia Sapienti, Scientia &
virtus sunt in anima. Luc. de penna. Of which opinion Ouid seemed to bee,
saying,

                        Non census, nec opes, nec clarum nomen auorum,
                        Sed probitas magnos, ingenium
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                            facit.
                        Sed virtus magnum reddit, & ingenuum.
                     
                  
                  A Gentleman aduanced for vertue shalbe preferred before a Gentleman

                  In giuing witnesse, the testimony of a Gentleman ought

of Gentlemen are preferred.
                  In commitment of portions appertaining to persons Lunatike or Orphans,
the Gentlemen of their blood are to be trusted, before any person
of meaner qualitie, and likewise in their marriages.
                  If a Gentleman be an inhabitant of two Cities, and called to Office in
both: it shall be in his choyse to goe vnto the more noble, or otherwise at
his pleasure.
                  A Gentleman ought bee excused from base seruices, impositions and
duties, both reall and personall.
                  A Gentleman condemned to death, was anciently not to be hanged,
but beheaded, and his examination taken without torture.

                  CHAP. 18.
                  Of the diuers dispositions of Gentlemen, according
to the humour of the Countrey
where they inhabit.
                  
                     FIrst it is to be remembred, that Gentlemen (which title
comprehendeth all degrees of dignitie) are either attendant
vpon Princes, or Officers in the State, or els doe liue priuately
vpon their owne possessions.
                  These men, as they are diuers, so are they diuersly affected.
                  The Romanes antiently delighted in Armes, but in times of peace occupied
themselues in Agriculture, as an exercise honest and commendable.
Which Titus Liuius seemeth to affirme, by these words: Bonus Ciues,
& bonus Agricola.
                  
                  The Neapolitan standeth so high vpon his puntos d'honor, as for the most
part he scorneth Marchandise, Phisicke, and all other professions profitable.
Yea his disdaine of base parentage is such, as a Gentleman Neapolitan
accounteth it more honourable to liue by robbery, then industrie: and will
rather hazard his daughter to incurre infamy, then marry her to a most
rich Marchant, or other ignoble person.
                  The Venetian, albeit he reputeth himselfe the most noble Gentleman
of the world, being capable of all offices in that Common weale, yet he
holdeth it no dishonour to traffique in marchandise.
                  The Genoues do hold the selfe same opinion: though true it is, that some
of them haue Castles, and houses vpon the mountaines, and there at occasions
doe inhabite.
                  The Germaine Gentlemen, doth (as it were euer) abide in his Countrey
house or castle, and is not much ashamed to better his reuenew by
robbery and pillage. Yet some of them doe serue or follow Princes, and
thereby become the better nurtured.
                  The French Gentlemen, almost generally doe inhabit their houses in
the Village, and manure their owne lands, which course was anciently accounted
most commendable. For Lycurgus King of the Lacedemonians
made a Law, enioyning all Gentlemen to dwell in the Countrey, the more
commodiously to endeuour the exercises and vertues Militarie.
                  Much after that maner the English Gentlemen that liueth priuately,
doth dispose his life: as one that accounteth it no honour to exercise Marchandize:
neither did they (in times past) repute the practise of Lawe or
Phisicke, so commendable as now they doe. For their ancient endeuour
was agriculture, and feeding of cattell, to maintaine honorable hospitality,
being perswaded, the more rich they were, the more they were esteemed.
                  
                     
Among the Grecians there was not anciently any meane to be aduanced,
but only by the Emperours seruice: wherein whosoeuer did continue
any time (were he neuer so basely borne) should notwithstanding be made
a Gentleman.
                  The Egyptians and Affyrians would not admit any man to haue the title
of a Gentleman, vnlesse he were a souldier, and skilfull in Militarie affaires.
The rest of the people liued as slaues without reputation.
                  The Tartarians and Muscouites doe holde no man worthy the name of
a Gentleman, vnlesse he be a man of Armes, a Captaine, or at the least, a
souldier of extraordinary account. For learning is there of no price.
               
               
                  CHAP. 19.
                  Of Kingdomes, and how Kings are to precede
according to the Councell of Constance, in the time
of King Henry the fift.
                  
                     WE reade that anciently the greatest, and most noble Kings
of the world were these: viz. The King of Sycionia, the King
Egypt, and the King of Assyria; but of them, that of Assyria
of greatest power. For Ninus the sonne of Belus, had conquered
and brought to his obedience all the people of Asia,
(India excepted.) Others affirme hee commaunded the one halfe of the
world, and some say he was King of a third part. So writeth S. Augustine
li. 17. cap. 17. de ci. Dei.
                  
                  It is likewise by other writers said, that in ancient time were foure mighty
Kingdomes (by Daniel) compared to foure mettals: viz, That of Assyrians
in the East was likened vnto gold: that of the Persians and Medians to
siluer: that of the North Regions to brasse: that of the Romans in the West
to yron. But the kingdomes of the East were most honourable, though (at
length) it pleased God that the Empire of Rome (resembled to yron) both
in longitude and latitude exceeded all others: For as yron doth cut and
decrease all other mettals, so the dominion and power of Romanes abased
and eclipsed all other Regall puissance. Howsoeuer that were, the glory
and greatnesse of the Romane force (in tract of time) did also become of
small force, weake and feeble: according to the prophesie of Daniel, ca. 2.
                  But leauing to speake more of times so ancient, we say that in Asia the
chiefe Kingdomes are Catai, Tharses, Turnester, Corasina, India, Persia, Media,
Georgia, Syria, Cappadocia, Ethinia, &c.
                  
                  In Affrica, is Ethiopia, Libya, Arabia, Iudea, Cilicia, Mauritania, Numidia and
others.
                  In Europe are likewise many kingdomes, but of them, these are most potent:
viz. England, France, Scotland, Spaine, Portugal, Denmark, Moscouia,
Sweden, Poland. &c.
                  
                  Now touching the Precedence of these Princes in Europe by diuers writers

it is affirmed, that the King of France may iustly claime the chiefe
place.
                  First, for that it pleased God to send from heauen vnto Clodoueus the first
Christian King of that Nation, three Lilies (as a Diuine fauour) to be from
thenceforth borne in the Armes of that kingdome, before which time the
Kings Armes was three Toades.
                  Secondly, they alleage that France is the most ancient kingdome of Europe,
and that Suardus was King of that Nation in the raigne of Alexander.
                  
                  Thirdly, because the King of France is anointed: which indeed seemeth
a marke of much preeminence.
                  Fourthly, for that the French King beareth the title of Most Christian.
                  Lastly, because it hath been in sundry papall Consistories decreed, that
the Ambassadours of France should precede the Ambassadors of Spaine.
                  
                  Others hold that Precedencie appertaineth to the King of Spaine.
                  
                  First, for that he is entituled, The most Catholique King.
                  Secondly, because he is King of many kingdomes, and consequently
of most honour, according to the prouerbe of Sal. In mulitudine populi dignitas
regis: which reason Salust seemeth also to confirme, saying, Maxima
gloria in maximo Imperio.
                  
                  But we say the chiefe place of honour, and Precedencie in Europe, appertaineth
to the King of England.
                  
                  First, in respect of ancienty. For albeit Alexander first King of the Grecians,
and of Persia, called himselfe King of the world: euen at that time
Brutus was King of England, and (as some haue sayd) Suardus was then King
of France. But Gaquinus in his Chronicle of France, maketh no mention
thereof, not recordeth his name among the number of French Kings.
                  Secondly, the king of England is anointed, and so is no other king, but
the French King, the King of Sicil, and the King of Ierusalem.
                  
                  Thirdly, the King of England is crowned, which honour the King of
Spaine, Portugal, Aragon, Nauarra, and many other Princes haue not.
                  Fourthly, the King of England is a Prince most absolute, as from whom
is no appellation, either in iurisdiction Ecclesiastical or Ciuil.
                  And albeit Enqueranus Monstellet writeth that in the yeere 1420. at the
Interuiew of the Kings of England and France, making their entrie into
the Citie of Paris, the French King did ride on the right hand, and kissed
the Relikes of Saints first: Yet is that no proofe of his right in precedence:
for Quilibet rex seu Princeps, in suo regno in culmine sedere debet: so saith Corsetus
de potestate Regia.
                  
                  And admit that in time more ancient, the Kings of France had precedence
before England, yet since the Conquest, & famous victories of Henry
the fift, and Coronation of Henry the sixt in Paris, the Kings of England
may iustly take place: neither is the title of most Christian any proofe of
ancienty, being only an honour giuen for certein seruices done by King
Pepin and Charlemaine to the Church of Rome.
                  
                  As for the allegation of Spaine affirming that the King Catholike is owner
of many kingdomes, and therefore of most honor: that reason is of no
consequence. For so is also the King of England, whose only kingdome of

                     England is by nature inexpugnable, and so plentifully peopled as sufficeth
not onely to defend it selfe against all other Nations, but also to inuade,
and conquer, as both Spaine and France hath made experience.
                  But the last and most effectuall reason in fauour of England, is, that the
King and people thereof receiued the Gospell and faith Christian before
France or Spaine. Also the Bishops with the Ambassadours English had
precedence in the greatest general Councels of Christendome, as particularly
appeared at the Councell of Constance, where the Bishops of England
were present and honoured accordingly. At which time it was doubted
whether Spaine should be admitted a nation, but in the end the Spaniards
were allowed for the fift and last nation. And al the people there assembled
were diuided into fiue classes or rankes, viz. Germanes, French, English,
Italians, and Spaniards.
                  The Germane ranke contained themselues, Bohemia, Hungaria, Polonia,
Dalmatia, Graecia, and Croatia.
                  
                  The French had place alone, as a nation absolute.
                  To the English Nation, Scotland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and Cyprus
were adioyned.
                  The Italians had all the Kingdomes subiect to Rome, Sicily, Naples and
Argier.
                  
                  With the Spaniards were the Ambassadors and Bishops of Castilia, Arragon,
Maiorca, Nauarra, Portugall and Granado.
                  
                  This assembly contained the Legates and Ambassadors of 83. Kings.
Besides the person of the Emperor, and King of Romanes, two Popes (for
one died there,) fiue Patriarches, three and thirty Cardinals, fourtie and
seuen Archbishops, a hundreth forty and fiue Bishops, and 83. Suffragans.
                  Thirty and nine Dukes.
                  Thirty and seuen Earles being absolute Princes.
                  An hundreth and thirtie inferior Earles.
                  Seuentie and nine free Lords or Barons.
                  Knights of all Nations fifteene hundred.
                  Gentlemen twentie thousand, besides Doctors, Licentiats, and Scholemen
infinite.
                  For the King of England appeared Richard Beauchamp Earle of Warwick,
with him were foure Bishops, viz. Sarisbury, Chester, Bathe, and Bangor. Sarisbury
died during that Councell, and liuing tooke his place aboue all other
Bishops, as an Archbishop, and for the time was placed last in the
ranke of Archbishops.

                  Of Magistrates.
                  
                     NExt vnder Emperors, Kings and Princes Souereigne, are
foure degrees of Magistrates.
                  Some are called Magni and Illustres.
                  
                  Some are Medij and Spectabiles.
                  
                  Some are Minimi and Clarissimi.
                  
                  And some are Infimi.
                  
                  The first may be named Magistrates souereigne, as they who acknowledge
no superior, but the Maiestie of the Prince.
                  The second are they that yeeld obedience to them, and command other
Magistrates their inferiors.
                  The latter two are such as cannot command any Magistrate, but haue
power only ouer particular subiects within the limits of their iurisdiction.
                  Touching the first that haue authority to commaund all other Magistrates,
and acknowledge no superior but the Prince, they are fewer at this
day then heretofore. Yet certaine it seemeth, that some Romane Emperours
authorized one Magistrate or Lieutenant (without any companion)
to command all other Magistrates of the Empire, and to him all Gouernours
and Magistrates did appeale: Which Magistrate they called Praefectus
Praetorio. True it is, that at the beginning he was of no greater quality

then Captaine of the Legions Praetorian, as Seius Strabo, vnder Augustus, and
Seianus vnder Tibertus; vntill other Emperors succeeding by litle and litle
encreased their authority, as in the end the Praefectus Praetorio became Lieutenant
generall, and iudge of all questions and causes whatsoeuer, by
which occasion, that office was giuen vnto men learned in the Lawe: as
Martian vnder Otho, Papinian vnder Seuerus, and Vlpian vnder Alexander.
All which came to passe, before Armes were diuided from lawes, and Iusticers
from Captaines. Afterwards, this great office became imparted
vnto two, and sometimes three persons, purposely to abridge the excessiue
authority of one.
                  But touching the Precedencie of Magistrates, albeit they cannot aptly
be ranged with those of the Empire, yet may they (in some sort) be placed
according to the dignitie and degrees of those titles which the Romanes
anciently vsed. And touching their authority, it shal not be amisse to know
that a Magistrate is an Officer hauing power to command in the common
weale: among whom in the Romane Empire, the Praefectus Praetorio was
the chiefe, hauing authority aboue all other Officers, to whom also euery
one did appeale.
                  To this Praetor or Praefect we may compare the Grand Mayor du Pallais in
France, who in times past did in that kingdome beare chiefe office. To him
also in some sort we may resemble the high Seneschal of England, vnder
King William the Conqueror, and other Kings his successors. These Magistrates
might therefore bee reasonably called Illustrissimi chiefly in the
Kings absence. For sure it is, that in presence of the King all power of Magistrates
and Commissioners also doth cease: For during that time, they
haue no authority of commandement either ouer other subiects, or other
Officers their inferiors. But this mighty Magistrate is no more either in
England or France, yet during their authoritie they were called Illustrissmi:
which title signified a certein preeminencie aboue all Magistrates that
were Illustres, either Honorarij or Administrantes. Nam accidentia denominant
Subiectum.
                  
                  Next to these Illustrissimi or Maximi, the chiefe place of Precedencie
is due vnto those whome we called Illustres, and among them the L. Chancellour
is chiefe: etiam in dignitate impari: as one whose excellent vertue
ought be preferred before all other officers.
                  Likewise the Lord high Constable or Lord Marshall is a Magistrate
Illust. the Lord Treasurer, Admirall of England, the Lord Chamberlaine,
and all others of the Kings priuie Councell may assume the title of persons
Illust. or (as we commonly call them) right Honorable. So saith Cass.
                  
                  It seemeth also that Doctours who haue read in schoole the space of
twenty yeeres, may be called Illustrissimi as Purpuratus noteth.
                  To these Illust. or right Honourable personages, the lawes Emperiall
haue graunted many great priuiledges, as the same Barthol. discourseth.
                  After these, the Magistrates (whome we formerly called Spectabiles and
may in our tongue be tearmed Honourable) ought to follow: as commanders
in Armes, Iudges, Gouernours, or Lieutenants Generall of Prouinces
and Cities, &c.
                  
                     
The fourth place appertaineth to them that anciently were named Clarissimi
or Right worshipfull, who are inferiour Iusticers and Ministers, Colonels,
Captaines, and meane Officers, &c.
                  Lastly are they whome the Romanes intituled Infimi, and in English
Worshipfull, as Captaines of particular Castles, Iudges in Townes corporate,
where no action is triable aboue 3000 shillings.
                  Note here that euery Magistrate is an Officer, but euery Officer is not a
Magistrate: and of all Magistrates the Lord Chancellor hath euer had precedence,
not onely in England and Fraunce, but of all anciencie in euery
other place: for read we may, that Eginardus who wrote the life of Carolus
Magnus, was his Chancellor. Likewise Tribonianus was Chancellor vnto
the Emperor Iustinian; Iosaphat was Chancellor to King Dauid, 2. of Kings;
Vlpianus to the Emperour Alexander; Seneca to Nero: and in France, the
Chancellor hath so great preheminence, as he precedeth the Constable,
vnlesse he be the Kings brother or his sonne. For the better memory of the
degrees aforesaid, Lucas de Penna speaking of titular dignity, hath left these
verses vnderwritten.
                  
                     Illustris primus, medius spectabilis, imus
                     (Vt lex testatur) clarissimus esse probatur:
                     Et superillustris praeponitur omnibus istis.
                  
               
               
                  CHAP. 21.
                  Of Officers, and their Precedencie.
                  
                     OFficers seruing Princes are of diuers sorts: among which,
some doe attend the Princes person, others haue charge of
his Treasure; some are ministers of Iustice, and some are
commanders in warre.
                  For the better conceiuing of our intention therfore, and
the order of that which followeth, it behooueth to know, That the first
places of dignity doe appertaine to those that are attendant and administrant
in office illustrious. The second is due to them that haue heretofore
borne office of dignity, and are now vacant. The third belongeth to those
that haue obtained an office of dignity in reuersion.
                  These diuers degrees were in the Emperiall Court called Administrantes,
Vacantes, and Honorarij.
                  
                  The officers Administrant are to precede; next to them the Vacants,
and then the Honorarij or officers extraordinarie: in which order they are
euer to take place, In simili dignitate, non in dignitate dispari.
                  
                  But to begin with Administrants and their order among themselues,
thus it is: He that was first placed or sworne, ought euer to precede, and so
in order from the first to the last, In paridignitate. As for example: a Gentleman
of the Kings Chamber in ordinary attendance, shall take place before
all other Gentlemen, in part dignitate.
                  
                  
                     
The like order ought be obserued by the Vacants: for he that hath bene
longest vacant, may take place before him that is lesse ancient in vacancie.
As for example: He that was a Viceroy or an Embassador ten yeeres past,
shall sit before him that serued since, in pari dignitate.
                  
                  The same course is to be kept among the number of Honorantes or seruants
extraordinary. As for example: Hee to whome any office or other
place of dignity is granted in reuersion, being first therin placed or sworne,
shall goe before all others of his ranke, in pari dignitate. As for example: A
Master of Requests extraordinary must precede all others that haue since
obtained that dignity; yet true it is, that an officer extraordinary may be
by birth or otherwise so priuiledged, as he shall take place of a Vacant, and
sometimes also of an Administrant.
                  Note also that euery office or dignity granted by the Prince in his own
presence, shall be of greater reputation then if the same were giuen in absence,
or sent vnto him that receiueth it, data paritate in reliquis.
                  
                  The same law also commandeth that a Vacant shalbe preferred before
an officer extraordinary: and men of Armes seruing in any Emperiall or
Royall Court, shalbe priuiledged before others in pari dignitate. Iohan. de
Platea.
                  
                  Note likewise that these officers (whome we call Vacants) are of two
sorts: The one are they that haue absolutely quitted their offices, or consented
their places may be supplied by others: the other are they, who had
office in some City, Court, or Countrey, where now no such office is: as
the Counsellors of Milain, when that State was subiect to the French king,
are now no more officers in that City, being subiect to the King of Spaine:
yet doe they hold place of other Vacants, in pari dignitate.
                  
                  Likewise an Officer Administrant may sometime precede an Officer
Extraordinary, etiam in dignitate dispari. But otherwise it is with a Vacant
or extraordinary officer, for he is neuer preferred in pari dignitate. We call
him Extraordinary, that hath onely the name of an Officer, without administration
or fee: yet shall he goe before all others of that place, being his
punies or men of no place. As for example: A Gentleman waiter Extraordinary
shall not onely precede all other Gentlemen of lesse ancientie,
but also sit before all other Gentlemen not the Kings seruants, in pari dignitate.
And consequently euery man Extraordinary in the Princes seruice,
shall take place before all other men without office, and in pari dignitate.
                  
                  It is also to be remembred, that in euery office neere the person of the
King, or in his Royall house, there is euer one supreme and superlatiue officer
aboue the rest: and after him other Honorable officers of diuers degrees.
The rest are equall, yet with respect that he who was first preferred,
shall take place first. As for example: The chiefe Officer of the Emperors
house was called Praefectus sacri Palatij, and vnder him were certaine Comites;
as in the Court of England her Maiesties supreme Officer of houshold
is the Lord Steward, and next to him the Treasurer, Comptroller, & Cofferer:
in France, Le Grand Maistre: in Spaine, El Maggior domo, &c.
                  
                  Likewise those Emperors had one Praefectus sacri Cubiculi: another Stabuli,
with their Comites: as our Souereigne hath a Lord Chamberlaine, a

Master of the horse, and diuers officers inferiour to them. The rest of her
seruants in euery particular office, are to proceede as equals, hauing respect
to ancienty: For he that was first aduanced ought alwayes to take place
first, in pari dignitate. Which rule may direct euery man to goe, as becommeth
his qualitie, and consequently eschewe all occasions of offence, or
presumption. Whereunto we will adde one thing (perhaps by euery one
not obserued, or to all men not knowen) which is, that all men seruing
neere vnto the Princes person (in what office or place soeuer) are thereby
priuiledged and honoured. The words of the Law are these. Adhaerentes
lateri Principis, & eidem in officio seruientes, nobilitantur, & nobiles efficiuntur.
Omnes famulantes principi sunt in dignitate, & ideo nobiles: cum dignitas & nobilitas
idem sunt. Bart. Cap. de dignitatibus.
                  
               
               
                  CHAP. 22.
                  Of Honourable places due to great Estates,
their wiues and children.
                  
                     A Duke.
                     
                        A Duke must goe after the auncienty of his Ancestors creation,
so that he be of the same blood and stocke. And the
Dutchesse his wife to goe according to the same. But if he
be a Duke of new creation, then he is to proceede as a new
Duke.
                     He is to haue in his owne house a cloth of Estate, and in euery other
place, out of the Princes presence, so that the same come not to the
ground, by halfe a yard.
                     A Dutchesse (likewise) may haue her cloth of Estate, and a Barronesse
to beare vp her traine in her owne house. And no Earle ought to wash
with a Duke, but at the Dukes pleasure.
                     A Dukes eldest sonne is borne in the degree of a Marquesse, and shall go
as a Marquesse, and weare as many powdrings as a Marquesse, and haue
his assayes, the Marquesse being present, sauing he shall goe beneath a
Marquesse, and his wife beneath a Marchionesse and aboue all Dukes
daughters. But if so be a Duke hath a daughter, which is his sole heire, if
she be the eldest Dukes daughter, then she shall goe before and aboue the
Dukes eldest sonnes wife.
                     Also a Dukes daughter is borne equiualent to a Marchionesse, and shall
weare as many powdrings as a Marchionesse, sauing she shal goe beneath
all Marchionesse and all Dukes eldest sonnes wiues. They shall haue none
assayes in the Marchionesses presence. And if they be married to a Baron,
they shall goe according to the degree of their husbands. And if they be

married to a Knight, or to one vnder the degree of a Knight, they are to
haue place according to their birth.
                     Note that a Baron, is an Estate of great dignitie in blood, honor and habit,
a Peere of the Realme, and companion of Princes, and therefore no
disparagement vnto his wife (albeit a Dukes daughter) to take her place
according to her husbands condition.
                     All Dukes yonger sonnes be borne as Earles, and shall weare as many
powdrings as an Earle, sauing they shall goe beneath all Earles, and Marquesses
eldest sonnes, and aboue all Vicounts. And their wiues shall goe
beneath all Countesses and Marquesses daughters, and aboue all Vicountesses,
and next to Marquesses daughters.
                     Also all Dukes daughters shall goe one with another, so that alwayes
the eldest Dukes Daughter go vppermost, vnlesse the Princes pleasure be
to the contrary.
                  
                  
                     A Marquesse.
                     A Marquesse must go after the ancienty of his Ancesters creation. And
the Marchionesse his wife according to the same.
                     He is to haue a cloth of Estate in his owne house, so that it hang a yard
aboue the ground, and in euery other place, sauing in a Dukes house, or in
his Souereignes presence.
                     He may haue no assayes in a Dukes presence, but only his cups couered.
Neither may a Marchionesse haue her gowne borne, in a Dutchesse presence,
but by a Gentleman; for it is accompted a higher degree to bee
borne by a woman, then by a man. But in her owne house she may haue
her gowne borne vp by a Knights wife.
                     Also there ought no Vicount or Vicountesse to wash with a Marquesse
or a Marchionesse, but at their pleasures.
                     A Marquesse eldest sonne is borne in the degree as an Earle, and shal go
as an Earle, and haue his Assaies in an Earles presence, and weare as many
powdrings as an Earle, sauing that he shall goe beneath an Earle, and aboue
all Dukes yonger sonnes, and his wife shal go beneath all Countesses,
and aboue all Marquesses daughters.
                     But if the Marquesses daughter be his heire, and she the elder Marquesses
daughter, then she shall go aboue the yonger Marquesses eldest sonnes
wife.

                     Note that if any of all the degrees aboue written be descended of the
blood Royall, they ought to stand aboue and precede all others that are in
pari dignitate of themselues: as a Duke of the Bloud aboue all Dukes not of
the Bloud, and so the like in all other degrees, except the Princes knowen
pleasure be to the contrary.
                     A Dukes eldest sonne and heire of the blood Royall shall haue place before
a Marquesse, and if he be not of the blood, he shall haue place aboue
an Earle.

and if he be not of the blood, he shall haue place aboue a Baron.

who admitteth the Bishop of London to his right hand, and the Prelate
of Winchester to his left, the rest sitting as is before said, as they are elders
by consecration.

prouided a rich Chaire of Estate, and the ground being spred likewise with
tapits, her Maiestie kneeled downe against a deske couered with very
Princely furniture, and said the Lords prayer: and then the Bishop of London
in his Cope, deliuered her a booke containing all the Orders, Charters,
and Priuiledges belonging to the said Church: which her Maiesty receiuing,

did confirme and redeliuer vnto the Bishop in the presence of all
the Prebends and Churchmen, who attended her Highnesse in very rich
Copes: and so with the whole Quire singing before her, she proceeded vp
into the Chancell, where within a Trauers she rested vntill the Procession
and other diuine Anthems were sung. After which, her Maiesty entred into
the place ordained for the Duchie of Lancaster, which at that time was
newly reedified with faire and large glasse windowes, in which she stayed
during the Sermon preached at the Crosse by Doctor Perce then Bish. of
Salisbury; where, with the whole assembly of the people she gaue God publicke
thankes for that triumphant and euer memorable victory ouer the
Spanish Fleet, proudly by them called Inuincible. The Sermon beeing
done, her Maiestie went to the Bishops Palace, and there dined: and towards
euening returned vnto Somerset place by torchlight.
                  Against her Highnes cōming in the morning, the streets were railed and
hung with Blew broad clothes for the seueral Companies in their Liueries
to stand, & euery Company distinguished by Banners, Standards, and Penons
of their Armes richly painted, and illumined. The Gentlemen of the
Innes of Court likewise (being placed nere Temple Bar) stood orderly within
their railes. All the fronts of houses were couered with rich Arras and
Tapistry, and the windowes and streets replenished with all sorts of people
innumerable, who with great applause, and ioyful acclamations, both graced,
and honoured her Maiesties most Royall proceeding.

to her Maiestie at Temple Barre, who receiuing it, gaue him a Mace or
Scepter to beare, and deliuered the Sword to the L. Marquesse of Winchester,

                  Of Precedencie, among persons of meane
and priuate condition.
                  
                     BArtholus, in his discourse de re Militari & Duello, diuideth
men into three degrees: viz. great personages aduanced to
dignitie, men of reputation without dignitie, and common
or ignoble persons. Of whom Iac. Faber in his discourse vpon
Aristotles politickes, maketh nine sorts.
                  The first are husbandmen, whose endeuor is employed, about the fruits
of the earth.
                  Secondly, artificers occupied Arts either necessarie, honest or pleasing.
                  Thirdly, victualers, retailers of wares, and chapmen.
                  Fourthly, Marriners and sea souldiers.
                  Fiftly, Fishermen.
                  Sixtly, Watermen and Ferrymen.
                  Seuenthly, Masons, and labourers in stone.
                  Eightly, workemen of little substance, and Labourers.
                  Lastly, Bondmen and slaues.
                  Among common persons in euery Prouince or Towne, the Gouernor
or Captaine is of most reputation, notwithstanding hee be of a common
birth, yet in some Cities, the Maior or chiefe Iudge hath that chiefe honour,
and is superior to the military Officer, but generally men in Office,
are of more reputation then others without office, and Officers for life are
preferred before Officers annuall or time certaine: Data paritate in alijs.
Raynutius.
                  
                  Note also that euery man during the time he beareth office is to be respected
and honoured, as Purpuratus writeth: And to say summarily, all
wisemen hauing place of rule in any Prouince, Citie, or Towne, must be
preferred before others, albeit they are aduanced aboue the measure of
their vertue. For no man is so euill, but sometimes he doth well, Laudabilia
multa etiam mali faciunt. Pli.
                  
                  Men married are euer to precede men vnmaried, in pari dignitate. And
he who hath most children, or lost the greater number in the warre of his
Countrey, is to be most honored, Lex Iuli
                           •
                        . The like order ought be obserued
among women maried, in pari dignitate: and in Rome maydens
did anciently go before widdowes, and wiues also: and sonnes before their
Fathers.
                  Men hauing land of inheritance are to precede other hauing none: and
Citizens that are housholders, must be preferred before others hauing no
habitation, chiefly in such Cities and Townes where their Ancestors and

families haue bene of continuance in reputation of marchandise, or other
possessions. For next after Gentlemen and Magistrates they are to take
place, in pari dignitate. Yet here is to be noted, that if any Burgesse, Marchant,
or other man of wealth doe happen to purchase a Barony, yet ought
he not be a Baron, nor haue place among Barons, Iac. Rabuff.
                  
                  A father whose sonne beareth any Office, shall giue place to his sonne
in all publike meetings and seruices: but in priuate affaires, the order of
nature ought be obserued: and in domesticall conuersation, the father shal
goe and sit before the sonne. Likewise a Bishop must doe reuerence vnto
his father at home, but being in the Church the father shal follow him.
So for diuers respects the one and the other is honoured.
                  Betwene two equals, he that is in his owne iurisdiction shal precede: as if
an Archbishop or Cardinall doe come into the Diocesse of a Bishop, notwithstanding
they be persons of more dignity, yet ought they giue honour
vnto the Bishop, because their presence doth not cancell his authority.
                  A Citizen or dweller of any chiefe City, shall take place of other Inhabitants
of meaner townes or cities, when soeuer they meet in any place indifferent:
yet he who findeth himselfe within his owne Libertie or Iurisdiction,
shalbe preferred: which mooued Caesar to wish himselfe to be rather
the chiefe man of a little village among the Alpes, then the second person
in Rome.
                  
                  Among common persons also (chiefly where no dignity is) fathers are
to precede their sonnes: Honora patrem tuum, & gemitum matris tuae ne obliuiscaris,
Eccles 3. Likewise among equals, age is to be preferred in respect
of wisdome and experience. Many priuiledges and immunities are also
due to old age, and they in counsell ought to speake first: Loquere maior natu,
decet enim te, Ecclesiast. 2.
                  In the number of men meane borne, they that be learned deserue most
reputation, chiefly when both for Armes and Ciuil gouernment they deserue
praise, because such men be meete, as well for peace as warre. Also
among learned men the first place is due to Diuines, the next to Ciuilians,
and the third to Physicians. But Arnoldus de Villa Noua, sayth, Primus locus
in mensasolet seruari Sacerdoti, & Medico, in domo infirmi.
                  
                  After men learned, Iudges of inferiour Courts, Notaries, and Clerkes
doe seeme worthy of respect and preferrement: for more credit is to be
giuen vnto a Notary or Scribe then to other men: Super faciem Scribae imponet
honorem, Eccles.
                  
                  Also among popular persons, they that be vertuous ought bee most
esteemed: because it were iniury to take reward from men of good desert.
Honor est praemium virtutis, Arist. 8. Ethic.
                  
                  Men of good and charitable mind, are also worthy honour: for actions
of Iustice and pietie, are vniuersally praised: and the more, because men
indued with vertues intellectiue, are not many, Perdifficile est bonum esse,
Pittacus.
                  
                  In this number of Plebeians, to be naturally borne of the countrey or
towne where a man dwelleth, is also reason he should be esteemed: for Cicero
sayth, Potiores sunt Ciues quam peregrini.
                  
                  
                     
They are likewise worthy of respect, that are persons of good fame and
name: Bona fama impinguat ossa, Eccle.
                  
                  Among strangers, they ought be preferred that are borne in ciuil and
noble Nations: for by obseruation we see the people of some countreys
are prone to infamous conditions, and others inclined to honest endeuor.
Apuleius calleth the Aegyptians learned, the Iewes superstitious, the Scythians
poore of corne, the Arabians rich in sweete odours: and Liuie noteth
the Carthaginians for their perfidie, and Cicero taxeth the Spaniards
for their crast, but praiseth the Graecians for skill in Artes. Horace sayth
the Brytons are stout men, and franke house-keepers, and the Persians promise
breakers, &c. Howsoeuer it be, experience prooueth that all countreys
are inhabited, and euery man preferreth the place of his birth:
Dulcis amor patriae, —
                  
                  Among Citizens and inferiour persons, they are not to bee neglected
that descend of honest parents: for a
                        •
                     be it euery mans mind be his owne,
yet the temperature of the parents complexion giueth a certaine aptnesse
to vertue or vice, whereof we presume the childe good or euill. And verely
albeit one man begetteth another, yet rarely one minde bringeth forth
another of like capacitie and qualitie. Non mens, vt corpus, patrio de semine
manat. Pall.
                  
                  Also rich men are to be preferred, because the more a man possesseth
in the State, the more carefull he will be to conserue it: but poore men defiring
to better their fortune, are apt to innouation.
                  After rich men, persons honest and industrious ought be esteemed: for
idle and vnprofitable members in euery Commonweale deserue rather to
be punished then esteemed. Omnis arbor quae non facit fructum bonum excidetur,
& in ignem mittetur: Mat 3.
                  Among these sorts of men, beauty and seemely proportion of bodie do
promise much good, and are to be preferred: of which opinion Plato seemed
to be, saying, Optimumest bene valere. Secundo loco formosum esse. Tertio
habere diuitias bono modo partas. And Ouid. Gratior est pulchro veniens de corpore
Virtus.
                  
                  Likewise of these men some deserue preferment for excellencie in the
Art they professe, and some because they are employed in Arts more necessary
and commendable, as Architectors, and such Artificers as are entertained
by Princes, for they are dignified by their place, according as the
Prince affecteth their facultie, which mooued Martial speaking of Cookes
seruing Princes, to say,

                        Non satis est ars sola coquo seruire palato,
                        Nam

                  CHAP. 27.
                  Of Funerals.
                  
                     AS man (aboue other creatures) is honoured in life, so ought
his buriall be decent and honourable: Wherein we are to
follow the example of our Sauiour Christ being both God
and man. For albeit he subiected himselfe to worldly contumelies,
and death ignominious, yet was his Funerall notable
and glorious, according to the prophesie of Esay, saying, Eterit sepulchrum
eius gloriosum pro vt sepulchra Adae; Abrahae, Isaac & Iacob, & eorum
vxorum, & aliorum plurium patriarcharum fuerit gloriosa Cap. 11.
                  It seemeth also (of all ancientie) that burying of the dead hath bene
much commended: For we finde in Eccles. Mortuo non negabis gratiam, id
est, sepulturam. We reade likewise that Tob. did bestow sepulture vpon men
dead and slaine.
                  The Romanes likewise vsed many ceremonies in burying of the dead,
anointing their bodies, and in burning them caused many sweet spices to
be cast into the fire. For so was the corps of Sylla buried. This custome was
also obserued among the Egyptians, as appeareth in the last of Gene. where
Ioseph commanded his Phisitions, that they should embalme the bodie of
his father Iacob. In performing of which Ceremony they spent forty daies,
and thirty in mourning. In like manner, the people of Israel mourned for
Moses thirty daies. Deut. 34. And Valerius tit de Seruata relig. Maketh mention
that after the battell and slaughter at Canna, the Senate of Rome commanded
that e
                        •
                     ery Matrone of Rome should mourne thirtie dayes, and not
longer. Other customes among other Nations haue bene vsed: for some
were enioyned to end their mourning within fourty dayes: some others
within three, and some in seuen. But in France and England the vse of mourning
hath euer bene thirtie dayes, chiefly among persons of honour, as may
be conceiued of a sentence giuen in Burgundy by an Officiall there, who
hauing cited before him a Ladie called Iaquelina de la Trimoille daughter to
the Kings Lieutenant generall in Burgundy, vpon certaine promises matrimoniall,
she answered by Proctor, her apparance ought be excused, in
respect the thirty dayes of her fathers death were not expired: During
which time she might not goe out of her house, which Plea was allowed.
                  By that which hath bene formerly sayd of the last of Gen. we may obserue
three particular honours appertaining vnto a funerall, viz. the embalming
of the bodie: the solemne mourning, and the concourse of friends
when the corps is carried to interrement. For Ioseph assembled all his chiese
kinsfolke and friends of the house of Pharaoh to accompany his father vnto
the graue: which custome is still continued specially among persons of
State and reputation. And indeede no Nation is so vnciuill or sauage, as

vtterly to contemne the honest buriall of mens bodies. Yet doe we reade
that the Lotophagi doe cast their dead bodies into the Sea, affirming it maketh
no matter whether they consume by earth or water. Which custome
the excellent Doctor Modestinus reproueth in these words: Laudandus est
magis quàm accusandus haeres, qui reliquias testatoris non in mare secundum ipsius
voluntatem abiecerit, sed in memoriam humanae conditionis sepulturae tradidit.
Neither doe I like the conceite of Solon, who dying in Cyprus commanded
his heires, that the bones of his bodie should be burned, and the ashes
dispersed throughout the Countrey.
                  In old time, the Albanoys thought it no point of pietie to take care of the
dead: which Christians may not allow, as hath bene formerly said: Noli
mortuo denegare gratiam, Eccl. 2.
                  The Scythians were wont to eate the flesh of dead bodies at their feastes,
as a dish of great delicacie and honour: and the Hircani kept dogges purposely
to deuoure dead mens carcases. Likewise the Parthians seeing any
dead bodie, of man, beast, or bird, did foorthwith teare off the flesh and
then buried the bones.
                  The Massagetae vsed to beate old mens bodies to death with a cudgell,
and then gaue them to be eaten by Shepheards dogges, and such as died of
sickenesse were deuoured by wilde beasts. All which customes do deserue
to be abhorred.
                  But the Athenians were so carefull of Funerall dutie, as if any man did
neglect to burie a Captaine slaine, he was capitally punished. And the
Egyptians in building of their houses, did neuer forget to make their
Tombes with pyramides and other ornaments of excessiue cost: and they
dying, their bodies were embalmed and kept therein: as Cicero in his first
booke of Tusculane questions seemeth to affirme.
                  The first great Prince that begun to bury bodies of men slaine in the
warre, was Hercules: and such men are much commended by the Prophet.
Vos benedicti a Domino, qui fecistis misericordiam hanc cum Domino vestro Saul,
& sepelistis eum. Also Maccabaus, commanded his enemies slaine, to be buried
as appeareth, 2. Maccob. cap. 10. 12.
                  
                     Darius being slaine, and his bodie brought to Alexander, was sent vnto
his mother Tumbrudina: and Hannibal caused the carkasse of Paulus Emilius
to be buried. In like maner Gracchus and Marcellus were buried by their
owne enemies. Valerius lib. 5. de humanitate. And Baldus saieth: Expedit
reipub, non minus mortuos humari quàm viuentes conseruari.
                  
                  It is also extant, how Cyrus, by his testament, commanded his owne bodie
should be buried in the earth: and so did the Emperors Caesar and Alexander;
as Leonardus Aretinus hath written Epist. 94.
                  But omitting these Rites and Customes of time ancient, and people to
vs vnknowen: we see that at the buriall of our Princes and persons of honour
all their friends and domesticall seruants doe assemble, and carrie in
their hands the Armes, Pennons and other Hatchments appertaining vnto
the defunct. Which ceremonie (for the most part) is performed the
40. day after the decease of the defunct according to the example of ceremonies
vsed at the burial of Iacob, as in the 50. of Genesis at large appeareth.
                  
                     
                     By consideration of which Chapter, it may be conceiued, how pompous
the Funerals were in the old Testament, and how magnificent houses
and Tombes for that vse were allowed, as appeareth, 1. Macchab. 13 cap. Et

                        •
                     dificauit Simon super sepulchrum patris su

columnas arma, ad memoriam aternam: & iuxta arma naues sculptas, quae viderentur
ab hominibus nauig antibus mare.
                  It appeareth also in holy Scripture, that the body of Christ was buried
with a great ceremony; and how Ioseph and Nicod
                           •
                        mus caried him honorably.
Iohn 19. Venit ergo Ioseph, & tulit corpus Iesu. Venit autem & Nicodemus
quivenerat ad Iesum nocte primum, ferens mixturam myrrhae & aloes, quasi libras
centum. Acceperunt autem corpus Iesu, & ligauerunt cum linteis, cum Aromatibus,
sicut mos est Iudaeorum sepelire &c.
                  
                  We reade likewise in Tob. 12. Sepelire mortuos est opus pium. By which examples
it seemeth that pompous and honourable Funerals are not displeasing
to God, but allowed in all ciuill nations; with this caution, that no
man should be so superstitious as to beleeue these externall complements
to be propitiatorie vnto the soule. For S. Augustine in his booke de ciuitat
Dei saith, Sepulchrorū memoria sumptum funeris magis viuorum est consolatio,
quàm defunctorum vtilitas. And S. Ambrose in his sermons sayth thus. Quid
proficit sepulchrorum superbia? damna sunt potius viuentium, quàm subsidia mortuorum.
                  
                  Thus much touching honourable burials: whereunto wee will adde,
That forso much as diuers degrees of men doe vsually and casually meete
at our funerals in England, it seemeth necessary that in accompanying of
euery corps, heed should be taken that no indignity be offe
                        •
                     ed vnto any
Mourner, but ech man to march in such place, as is meete for his estate.
                  The Heralds therefore by their skill and care, are to take a List or Rolle
of all Mourners, then to marshall them into seuerall classes, by their diuers
titles, as Gentlemen, Esquires, Knights, Barons, Vicounts, Earles, &c. euer
preferring her Maiesties Officers and seruants before all others, in pari dignitate.
And if none of her Maiesties seruants be there present, then euery
one to proceede according to his antienty in pari dignitate.
                  
                  In this point also it behooueth the Herauld to be heedfull and prouide
that no man exceede in expences or charges superfluous, but euery one to
confine his cost within the bounds of his abilitie: for otherwise doing, the
executors or heires of the defunct, shall hereby receiue preiudice. For
some times we haue seene the buriall of an Esquire more costly then was
fit for a Knight, and a Knights funeral such as might become a Lord. To auoid
which excesse I could wish, that excepting the number of poore who
are commonly so many as the defunct was yeeres olde, her Maiestie or
Lord Marshall would be pleased to prescribe a certaine number of Mourners
to euery degree, and that no man of greater title then the defunct
should be permitted to mourne, so as the chiefe mourner may euer be in
pari dignitate with the defunct, and all the rest of meaner qualitie. As at
the buriall of an Esquire, onely Esquires, Gentlemen, and other inferiour

persons to mourne. At the funerall of a Knight, onely Knights, Esquires,
Gentlemen and their inferiors. The like order to be taken at all burials of
higher estates. Prouided neuerthelesse, that if the defunct be a Knight of
the Garter, a Knight of the Priuie counsel, or a Lord by office, then it may
be permitted Noblemen to mourne, because they are reputed persons honourable
and in pari dignitate: for as hath bene formerly sayd, Dignitas &
Nobilitas idem sunt Barthol de dig.
                  
                  
                     Nota, That an Officer of Armes weareth the Kings coate at th'enterrements
of Noblemen, and others of dignitie and Worship, not onely for
the ordering of the funerals, and marshalling of the degrees, as aforesayd,
but to the intent that the defunct may be knowen to all men to haue died
honourably in the Kings allegeance, without spot of infamie, or other disworship
to his Name, Blood, & Family: And that his heire, if he haue any,
or next of whole blood, or some one for him (which commonly is the chief
mourner) may publikely receiue in the presence of all the mourners,
the Coate armor, Helme, Creast, and other Atchieuements of honour belonging
to the defunct: whereof the King of Armes of the Prouince is to
make record, with the defuncts march, issue and decease for the benefit
of posterity.
               
               
                  CHAP. 28.
                  Of Monuments, and Epitaphes.
                  
                     NOw to close vp these discourses of Honour and humane
glory, it shall not be impertinent, to wish that among other
things, whereby the memory of Noble Princes, and other
great personages is preserued, that some care were also had
to saue their Tombes, and places of buriall from ruine and
violation A matter of more consequence, then euery one marketh, yet necessary
to be looked vnto, both for publique, and priuate respects.
                  
                     Marcus Tullius in his Oration against Varro telleth how Scipio did thinke
Portratures, Pictures, and other Monuments were deuised to ornifie Temples,
Cities, and Princes pallaces. In an other place also he saith, they
were made to retaine in memory, the excellent Actions of such men, as
had liued honourably, and died vertuously.
                  Another respect publique, to continue Monuments in reputation, is
that thereby diuers Arts of good qualitie (as Grauing, Caruing, Masonry,
Painting, Imbossing, and other commendable knowledges, be exercised.
For by such industry, many princely buildings be beautified, and many Artificers
doe aspire to great fame and riches: as Teledius and Theodorus his
brother: Lysias and Mentor, who framed the portraitures of Iupiter Capitolinus,
and Diana Ephesia, for which labour, the Poet Iuuenal vouchsafed him
this commendation: Multus vbique labor, rarae sine Mentore mensae.
                  
                  But that which perswadeth me most to allow and commend the Sciences

of sculpture and worke grauen, is this: Wee finde in holy Scripture,
how Besaleel the sonne of Vri, and Ooleab the sonne of Achimesech receiued
from God the Spirit of knowledge, how to make all manner of grauen
workes in gold, siluer, and other mettals, as appeareth in Exod cap. 35.
                  Seeing then that these Arts of pourtraying, painting, and sculpture, are
by so great authoritie approued, in vaine it seemeth to remember the praises
which profane Histories haue giuen to Phidias for making the portraiture
of Iupitre Olympius, or Archesilaus that graued the Image of Diana:
workes of more excellencie then can be expressed. The like praise is written
of Lysippus, whose hand onely was permitted to make the pourtraiture
of Alexander the Great: as Horace seemeth to affirme.

                  The Lawes Ciuil hauing regard to the preseruation of monuments, did
prouide, that if any bondman or other seruant doe breake or deface any
Tombe, or other funerall monument, he shalbe condemned to the galley
or forced to grind in a mill (the fact being done by his owne election:) But
if he were thereunto commanded, then he shalbe banished only. And who
so doeth conuey or take away a part or peece of any tombe or graue, the
same shalbe confiscate vnto the Prince, 2. of Cod.
                  
                  If a Iudge or other Magistrate be informed of any such fact, and doeth
not punish the offender, he shall forseit twenty pound in gold: and euery
person hauing committed such a crime, shall pay ten pound in golde, and
endure such punishments as the lawes haue prescribed. Cod. 3.
                  Note also that euery offence of this qualitie is reputed equall to peri

                      where

the monument of Godfrey of Bouillon remaineth, and thereupon this inscription,
commanded that no stone thereof should be taken or touched: Hie

cultui, cuius anima regnet cum Christo, Amen.
                  
                  And sith we are here occasioned to speake of these matters, it shall not
be amisse to say somewhat of Epitaphs, being indeed Monuments of no
lesse glory and perpetuity, then the greatest Obeliskes and Pyramides of
the world.
                  Of Epitaphs be diuers kindes: some are praiseworthy, some partiall,
some inuectiue, some conceited, some Poeticall, and some Morall, according
to the sundry humors and passions of seuerall writers.
                  The ancient Romanes did make their Epitaphs briefe, plaine, and true,
vsing onely a few letters for wordes: but in these our dayes no wordes are
thought praises enough, nor no praises can suffice vnlesse they do exceed.
                  My selfe haue seene Epitaphs, wherein an ordinarie Orator hath beene
compared to Cicero, a meane Poet to Virgil, and an audacious captaine to
Caesar, Pompey, Scipio, Cyrus, and all the Worthies.
                  
                     Iulius Caesar had no Epitaph at all, but vnder his pourtraiture some fewe

                        •
                     nscriptions: as this, Parenti optimè merito. And on the tombe of Pompey
the Great, were these wordes onely, Hic situs est magnus P. Of Cyrus thus,
Quisquis es mortalium, & vndecun

                        •
                     ound:

                        Deuicto Hannibale, capta Carthagine, & aucto

                        Respice res bominum, quàm breuis vtna premit.
                     
And of later time for Charles the fifth, it was likewise sayd:
