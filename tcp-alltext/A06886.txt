Thā can he not be here present, for trulyBarthrā prieste yf the mistery be▪done, vnder no fygure, than do we naught, to call it a mystery, for that cannot haue the name of a misterye, wherin no

the water of the roke into his fleshe and bloud. Notwythstandyng hys fleshe was hāged on the crosse for vs, longe after, and hys blood shed, and here you shall consydere what is ment by these wordes spo ken▪ by christ, except you shall eate the fleashe of the sonne of mā, and drike his blood, you shal not haue lyfe in you, he sayd not yt his fleshe whych hāged on the crosse shuld be cute in pecys, and eaten of hys Apostles, nor that hys blood whych he shed for the redemption of thee world, shuld be geuen his disciples to drincke, for it were a wycked thynge yf hys fleshe shuld be eaten and hys blood dronken, as the capharnetes and infidelles toke it, beynge offended wyth hys sayinges, therfore he sayd to hys dysciples, yf you shall see the sonne of man ascendyng thyther where as he was before. &c. (as thoughe he shulde saye) You maye not thynke my fleshe, to be eaten of you corpo rally, neyther my fleshe, to be deuy ded into peces, for asmoch as after my resurrection, ye shal se me vysyhly ascend into heauē, wyth the
