            A CONTINVAtion
of a former Relation,
concerning the entertainment giuen
to the Prince his Highnesse, by the
King of Spaine in his Court at
MADRID.
            
               ON Tuesday the 18.
of March, being the
second day after his
Highnesse entrance
into the Palace, diuers
Ambassadors
and Graundes of Spaine, desired leaue
of the Prince to come and kisse his
hands. And that day the Duke of Infantado,
and the Duke of Cea, Grandchild
to the Duke of Lerma, came

accompanied with diuers Noblemen
and Caualleros of their owne
Families, to see him, and to offer him
their seruice; after dinner the Prince
went abroad, and ranne some courses
at the Ring.
            On Wednesday the 19. the King
being accompanied with his Brothers,
Don Carlos, and the Infante Cardinall,
came to visit the Prince in his
lodgings, from whence they all
went into the Kings quarter, where
hee was entertained with musicke,
and saw many rare and curious pictures.
            The next morning being Thursday,
the King came againe into his
Highnesse lodging, and conducted
him by a priuate way to his Coach,
with whom entred Don Carlos, the
Infante Cardinall, the Lord Marquesse

               Buckingham, the Conde of Oliuares, the
Marquesse of Carpio, and the Earle of
Bristol: they went about foure leagues
from the towne to hunt the Wolfe,
where they found many hundreds
of the country people driuing the
mountaines, who brought neere vnto
the seuerall standings of the King
and the Prince, where they were placed
with their Peeces, some Wolues;
but they had not the fortune to kill
any. That day his Maiesty and his
Highnesse dined abroad in the fields
vpon the ground, and spent the rest
of the day with shooting in their
peeces.
            Fryday the one and twentieth of
March, being the day whereon the
late King of Spaine died, was spent
by the King and those of his Court,
in deuotion and in performance of

such Ceremonies as are vsually euery
yeere done by them there in remembrance
of his Obsequies.
            The next day the Cardinall Spinola,
and diuers others, Ambassadors
and Graundes came to kisse the Princes
hands in the morning. After dinner
the King accompanied with his
Brothers, and the Conde of Oliuares,
came into the Princes quarter to visit
him, with whom hee went downe
into the Gardens, from whence taking
Coach, they passed into the
fields to see some flights of the Earle
of Bristolls high flying Hawkes: And
afterwards they ran sundry courses
at the Ring that day.
            On Sunday the 23. of March, the
Prince remained priuate in his lodging
till towards the euening, and
then hee walked into the Gardens.

The Conde of Monterey feasted the
Lord Marquesse of Buckingham, the
Earle of Bristoll, and Sir Walter
Aston, at dinner that day, and presented
the Lord Marquesse with diuers
Crystall vessels of great worth.
And towards night there arriued the
Earle of Carlisle, the Lord Viscount
Andouer, the Lord Montioy, with others.
            The next morning the Prince was
visited againe by the President of
Castile, and the Presidents of the other
Counsells, who came to let
him know, that since the time that
the King their Master had giuen
them charge to receiue and obey
all such Consultas and Commands
as shall come from his Highnesse,
there had beene a stay made of all
businesses in their Courts, for that
hitherto his Highnesse had not beene

pleased to dispose of any thing; In
regard whereof they said they had
taken the boldnesse to put him in
minde thereof, and to beseech him
to beleeue, that the Order which
they had receiued from his Maiesty
was not complementall, but really
desired and intended. And
therefore they humbly intreated the
Prince, that hee would vouchsafe to
giue some speedy order for the dispatch
of bufinesse, and the bestowing
of such places as were then,
or should heereafter happen to bee
void. In the euening of the same
day, there was running at the Ring,
and at the Está Firmo; his Highnesse
breaking many staues very well,
and with great applause.
            The day following being Tuesday,
the King carried his Highnesse
abroad a hunting to the Pardo,
               
where they spent all the day, and
had no very good sport, yet they
saw many Stags and Boares: They
did eat together vpon the ground
in the open fields with very good
appetites.
            The six and twentieth, the Prince
spent in dispatching away a Messenger
from thence hither. On which
day there arriued at Madrid the Marquesse
of Inojoça, who was gouernor
of Millan, and now Vice-King of
Nauarre, from which place hee
was sent for, to prepare himselfe
to goe into England, as Ambassador
extraordinary to the King
our Soueraigne. The more to honor
him in this imployment, beside his
personall merit, hee was sworne a
Counsellor of State, he is to depart
within few daies.
            
               
Thursday the seuen and twentieth,
was the first day of a Parliament
held in the Kings Palace, at
which his Maiesty was present in
the morning. After dinner hee
came vnto his Highnesse, and tooke
him into his owne lodgings, where
they spent part of that afternoone
in conuersation, and in beholding
diuers Masters of defence, who
played at seuerall weapons before
them.
            The next day, after dinner, his
Highnesse passed away the time awhile
in a Garden adioyning to
his lodgings: and about foure or
fiue of the clocke he was by the Conde
of Oliuares conducted to a window
in the Palace, to see diuers
Fencers play; and from thence to
the Kings Armory, where (amongst
many others which were both rich

and curious) hee saw the Armes of
the Emperour Charles the fifth; and
of the French King, Francis the
first.
            The nine and twentieth of this
moneth was his Maiesties Birth-day,
which caused much brauery and
gallantery in the Court. In the
morning of this day, the Prince
sent the Earle of Bristoll vnto the
King, to giue him the En hora buena,
as also to the Queene and to the Infanta,
to congratulate with them
(as is the custome of that Court)
that his Maiesty did on that day
cumplir An̄os: The same day the
Lord Marquesse of Buckingham had
his first audience of the Infanta,
who receiued him and those that
went with him, with much curtesie.
In the euening the King hauing
with him the Queene, the Infanta,

Don Carlos, and the Infante Cardinall,
attended on by the whole Court,
went in a solemne manner to visit
a Monastery of the Descalsas,
wherein liueth the Infanta Doña
Margarita, Daughter to the Emperour
Maximilian, and great Aunt to
his Maiesty. His Highnesse to see
them went priuatly in a Coach,
and was conducted in such a manner,
that at their going thither, and
returning, he saw them passe by in
foure seuerall places.
            The next day being Palme Sunday,
his Maiestie and all the
Court passed through some parts
of the Palace, in a solemne and
publique procession, the which
the Prince likewise beheld from a
secret place. In the afternoone the
King and the Prince met to see the
fencing againe, with which they

entertained themselues some time.
And this day his Highnesse gaue one
thousand pounds sterling, to bee
bestowed and distributed in the
Holy weeke in almes, vpon prisoners
and other poore people of
Madrid, which was greatly esteemed,
and hath done him much
honour with all sorts of people
there.
            On Munday the Genoa Ambassador
with all the Hombres de
Negocios of that State, which
were in Madrid, came and kissed
his Highnesse hands. The rest
of that day hee spent in reading
Spanish and in priuate.
            Vpon the second of Aprill,
the Prince hauing with him the
Lord Marquesse of Buckingham and
the rest of the English Nobility

that are there, went towards the
Pardo to see the Earle of Bristols
Hawkes flie, where they met the
Kings Hawkes, which were made
especially for the Kite and the
Crowe: But the day prouing
windie and vnfit to hawke in, his
Highnesse went to hunt, at which
he had much good sport, and
killed two wilde Boares. In the
euening, as hee returned, hee was
met vpon the way by the Conde
of Oliuares, and the Conde of Monterey,
who waited on him to the
Palace.
            The next day being Wednesday
in the Holy weeke, the publique
and solemne exercise of deuotion
began, and the Procession,
and the disciplinants which euery
yeere doe vsually passe through
the streets, and likewise (as their

custome is) close by the Palace,
so that the Prince beheld them out
of his owne Chamber window.
That day his Highnesse stirred not abroad,
but about the euening hee
was visited by the Conde of Oliuares
from his Maiesty.
            
            On Thursday his Highnesse went
priuatly and saw his Maiestie wash
the feet of the poore, and performe
other ceremonies vsually done vpon
that day. In the afternoone
there passed by his Highnesse window
a greater Procession then had
done the day before.
            Good Friday was spent by that
King in hearing Sermons, and in
deuotion; and towards the euening
when the great Procession was to
passe by, the Conde of Oliuares, the
Conde of Monterey, and others of the

Counsell of State, came to the
Prince his lodgings, and attended
him all the time it was passing
by, and afterwards his Highnesse
went downe to walke in a Garden.
            Satterday the Prince spent all the
morning in priuate within his lodging,
and in the afternoone desiring
to giue his Maiesty the buenas Pascuas,
as the vse is there, he could not
bee permitted: But towards the
euening his Maiesty accompanied
with his two brothers, came into
the Prince his lodgings, and gaue
him the buenas Pascuas, where
they sate and discoursed a good
while.
            The next day being Easter day,
the Prince hauing desired leaue to
repay the Visit and the buenas Pascuas,
               
was accordingly about foure
a clocke in the afternoone, brought
by a priuate way vnto the King,
with whom when hee had beene
a short space, and performed that
complement, he intimated a desire
to doe the like vnto the Queene,
and was presently conducted by
his Maiesty, being also priuately
attended by all the Grandes and
great Ministers of the Court, from
his owne side, vnto the Queenes,
which is on the other side of the
Palace, and there hee found the
Queene and the Infanta together, attended
by all the Ladies of the
Court; This being the first time
that hee had personally visited the
Infanta. There were foure Chaires
set; in the two middlemost sate the
Queene and the Infanta; on the right
hand of the Queene sate the Prince,
and on the left hand of them all

sate the King. When the Prince had
giuen the Queene the buenas Pascuas,
and passed some other complements
of gratitude, for the fauors
he had receiued from her since his
comming to the Court, he rose out
of his Chaire, and went towards
the Infanta, who likewise rose vp to
entertaine him; and after fitting
curtesies on both sides performed,
there passed some discourse betwixt
them, such as was fit for the
enteruiew of two such Princes,
in which it pleased the Prince
to command the Earle of Bristoll
to doe him seruice as Interpreter.
The Prince then retired himselfe
to his Chaire, and sate downe againe
by the Queene, with whom
he performed some short complement.
Afterwards they all rose vp,
and with much courtesie tooke
their leaues: in all which things

the Prince his comportment was so
naturall and sutable to his qualitie
and greatnesse, that he gaue thereby
iust cause to the Spaniards highly to
honor him, as it appeares they generally
do. From the Queenes side he was
conducted by his Maiesty, in the
same Equipage that hee came thither,
vnto the Kings side, where
when hee had entertained his Highnesse
a while, with beholding from a
Window certaine Masters and Gentlemen
that exercised Fencing before
them, his Maiesty then led him to
another window that looked vpon
a large place before the Court gate,
and telling the Prince that he would
only goe and see the Queene, tooke
his Brother Don Carlos with him, leauing
the Infante Cardinall with the
Prince, to expect his returne. But
before much time was passed, there
appeared about threescore of the
principall Nobility of that Kingdome

in the place before the window,
who were all very richly
apparrelled with Embroyderies,
and being on horsebacke ranne two
and two together their seuerall careeres:
they had all their faces discouered,
saue onely the King, Don
Carlos, the Conde of Oliuares, and the
Marquesse of Carpio, who had vizards.
            On Easter Munday his Highnesse
dispatched hither another messenger,
at whose departure (God be
thanked) hee enioyed perfect
health, hauing beene continually
from time to time exceeding
much caressed and esteemed by
that King, who delighteth extremely
in his company, and
greatly honored by all the Court
for his braue and Prince-like Comportments.
