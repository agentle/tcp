Forsothe they are to lewd
               To say so all beshrewd.

               Of the bysshoppes lore

               But Ire and venire
               And sol fa / so a lamyre

               And surely thus they say
               Bysshoppes if they may
               Small houses wolde kepe
               But slombre forth and slepe

Howe bysshoppes dysdayne
               Sermons for to make
               Or suche laboure to take
               And for to say trouth
               A great parte is full slouth
               But the greattest parte
               Is for they haue but small arte

               With in theyr heedes wonnyng
               But this reason they take
               How they are able to make
               With theyr golde and treasure
               Clerkes out of measure
               And yet that is a pleasure
               Howe be it some there be
               Almost two or thre
               Of that dygnyte
               Full worshypfull clerkes
               As appereth by theyr werkes
               Lyke Aaron and Ure
               The wolfe from the dore

               From theyr goostly shepe
               
                  
And theyr spirituall lammes
               
               Sequestred from rammes
               And from the berded gotes
               With theyr heery cotes
               Set nought by goldene grotes
               Theyr names if I durst tell
            
            
               ¶ But they are loth to mell
               And loth to hang the bell
               Aboute the cattes necke
               For drede to haue a checke
               They ar fayne to play / deuz decke
               How be it they are good men
               Moche herted lyke an hen
               Theyr lessons forgottē they haue
               That becket them gaue

               But nowe euery spirituall father
               Men say they had rather
               Spende moche of theyr share
               Than to be combred with care
               
                  
¶ Spende / nay but spare
               For let se who that dare
               Sho the mockylsoe mare
               They make her wynche and keke
               But it is not worth a leke
               Boldnesse is to seke
               The churche for to defend
               Take me as I intende
               For lothe I am to offende
               In this that I haue pende

               Men say ye cannot appare
               For some say ye hunte in parkes
               And hauke on hobby larkes
               And other wanton warkes
               Whan the nyght darkes
               What hath lay men to do
            
            
               The gray gooes for to sho
               Lyke houndes of hell
               They crye and they yell
               
                  
Nowe that ye sell
               The grace of the holy gost
               Thus they make theyr bost
               Through euery cost
               Howe some of you do eate
               In lenton season fleshe mete
               Fesauntes partryche and cranes
               Men call you therfor prophanes
               Ye pycke no shrympes nor pranes
               Saltfysshe, stocfysshe nor heryng
               It is not for your werynge
               Nor in holy lenton season
               Ye wyll nitheyr benes ne peason
               But ye loke to be let losse

               Without a capon stewed
               Or a stewed cocke
               Under her surfled smocke
               And her wanton wodicocke
            
            
               And howe whan ye gyue orders
               In your prouinciall borders
               
                  
As at sicientes

In connyng and conuersacyon

               There shall no clergy appose

               What are they the worse
               For a symonyake
               Is but a hermoniake
               And no more ye make
               Of symony men say

               Reporte howe the pope may
               A holy anker call
               Out of the stony wall
               And hym a bysshop make
               It he on hym dare take
               To kepe so harde a rule
