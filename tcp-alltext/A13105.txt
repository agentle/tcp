            To the right Honorable, Robert Lord Ritche, his singular good Lorde and Moecenas, Philippe Stubbes, wisheth all prosperitie in this life with increase of Honour and eternall felicitie in the heauenly Hyerarchie by Iesus Christ.
            
               IN the Gospell after S. Matthewe (right honorable, and my very good Lorde) oure Sauioure Christ teacheth vs most notably, how to knowe and discerne false Prophetes, from such as bee the true Pastours, & Ambassadours of Iesus Christ: when he saith, They shall come vnto you in sheepes clothing, but inwardly they are rauening wolues, you shal know thē by their fruites. Then if the fruites of conuersation bee the ensignes, the badges, and cognizances to know false Prophets by (as our sauiour sayth they are) thē surely may we iudge, nay certainly perswade our selues that the Papistes are those false Prophets, Apostataes, and seducers

which the word of God speaketh of: as in the further discourse of this booke shall manifestly appeare: for not only do their works & fruits conuince them heereof, but also their false, seditious erronious, and heretical doctrine doth argue the same. But they will easilye wipe away this blot: and saye that we are those false Prophets of whom Christ speaketh of. To whom I answeare, let their workes, and doctrine bee compared to ours, and bothe peyzed in the equall ballance of Gods worde (the onely touchstone to trie all controuersies by) and then shall it easilye appeare whether they or wee are the false Prophetes. Doe not they come vnto vs in sheeps cloathing, I meane in suche habite as portendeth all kinde of austeritie, humilitie, and holinesse of life outwardlye: as namelye, in their Surplesses, Copes, Tippets, forked Cappes, Miters, Hattes, Crosiers, Hoodes, Cowles, Tunicles, Sandals, Shirtes of hayre, and a thousande other like playerlike garmentes? yea and doe they not teache that all holinesse consisteth in these ragges? Is not this to come in sheepes cloathing? But they will obiect, if thys bee so, why doe you weare some of these garmentes? I aunsweare, wee haue some of them in deede

but that is vppon sufferaunce and permission onely, not vppon constrainte or necessitie as theirs are. Besides, ours is commaunded by a Christian Queene, and therefore lawefull, theirs by Antichriste, and therefore vnlawfull. Againe we vse them as things indifferent they as things of necessitie, we repose no religion in them, they relye holy vpon them.
            And for theyr doctrine, it is so erronious, so corrupte, so seditious, nay so blasphemous, and Sacrilegious, that it would greeue a Christian manne to thinke of it: As Prayer for the dead, Iustification by good works, Purgatorie, Limbo Patrum, Inherēt Rightuousnesse, Inuocation to Saincts, Transubstantiation, Adoration of Images, their seuen coūterfait Sacramentes extreeme vnctiō, christening of Bels, hallowing of churches & churchyardes, makinge of holy bread, holy water, Auricular confesion, shrift, penāce, absolutiō, masse, mattēs, diriges, Lady Psalters, tapers, candles, bedes censings, ringings, perfuminges, & legions of like trūperies, which the word of God knoweth not: of al which pointes of doctrin of theirs I wil intreat in a book by it self god willing very shortly, wherin shal appeare whether they or we haue ye truth. This is their godly doctrin which

ther it com nerer to the word of God, or ours, let the world iudge. And yet notwithstanding they set a faire face on it, they stamp and stare, & beare the world in hand, that theirs is the truth. For say they, our doctrine standeth vpon sure pillers, antiquitie, vniuersalitie, generalitie & the like. Our doctrine is proued by discent of Bishops from time to time, by consent of all nations and so foorth, but your doctrine is newe and starte vppe the laste day, &c. But whether theirs or ours bee the newer it shall appeare in the discourse following. First wee are able to proue that our doctrine is auncienter then theirs, ye as auncient as God himselfe whose truth it is. And first to begin with the diuine institution in Paradice: wee reade that God the father gaue vnto Adam his word & commandement, to wit: Thou shalt not eat
                  •
                of the tree of knowledge of good and euil, ingrauing, and as it were imprinting, this word & commandement in the heart of Adam, and in him, in all his posteritie. By the which lawe, of conscience then liued almost 2000. yeeres without any other law or word written, being guided & directed by the holy Ghost in all their actions: the 2000. yeares being ended, & men waxing dissolute, licentious & wicked, ye
               
Lorde (as Theophilactus witnesseth) disdayning to speake to them any longer by his spirit for that they became wicked, gaue thē a Lawe, (for before they hadde no written Lawe, God appearing to them I meane the fathers and Patryarches, in visions in apparitions, in dreames, sometime in the forme of angels, & waifaring men, sometime in one shape, sometime in an other, according as their weakenesse could beare) written by the finger of God in two tables of stone, which is the x. commaundements. Then Moses at the commandement of God committing to writing, the x. commandements with his other fiue books, as he was taughte and directed by the suggestion of the spirit of God, ruled the Israelites thereby. The old testament being thus written by the seruant of God Moses, & his faithful prophets at the commandement of God▪ continued in force til the cōming of Christ, which was in effect 2000. yeeres after. Thē our sauiour Iesus Christ, cōming in the flesh, gaue in commandement to his Euangelists, Apostles, and prophets to write the new testamēt, which they, by the direction of gods spirit, did most happily perform. These 2. testaments now, the old & the new God be thāked, we haue. Now let the

papists disproue this if they can, or if they haue any other Gospell, let thē bring it forth: They cānot deny, but we haue the same word of god which God the father, our sauiour Christe & the holy ghost haue giuen to the woorlde: & this being graunted, it must needs folow, that our doctrine is true, & theirs most false Now let them deriue their antichristian doctrine lineally from suche antiquitie, & truth as this, if they can: but that they shall neuer bee able to do. For their doctrine hath bin longer in patching, then Solomons temple was in building. Yea within these x or xii. hundred yeeres, there was not a scrap of their pesteferous doctrine coyned: no the egg was not thē laid that hatched that poisoned Cocatrice. Then the truth of gods word throgh the iniquitie of time, beginning by little & little to suffer eclipse, at the last sprang vp such mountaines of heresies, & corruptiōs, cast out of the bottomles pit, & as it were spewed out of the Diuels mouth, that the truth was altogether obscured.
            Then Antichrist the pope sprong vp challenging superioritie ouer all the face of the earth, and he begun the Romish religion, & so euery one succeeding him put to somwhat yea euery Frier, Monk, Abbot, Prior, Prouost, parson, Vicar,

Cardinal, and euen al in general added to it, euery one a patch. So that the papists religi- (if it may bee called a Religion) is nothing els than the shreddes, the peeces and patches, the drosse & dregs of corruptible mē: & ours the doctrine of the holy ghost. But although that it could not be proued that our doctrine is aū
               cienter then theirs, yet the truth of the same dependeth not vpon the antiquity. For Christ saith in the Gospel, Ego sum via, veritas & vita: I am the way, the truth, and the life. He saith not, I am custome, I am antiquity. And therfore I say Antiquitas sine veritate est vetustas erroris: Antiquity without truth, is the aūcient of error. Custome, nor antiquity cā not make that true, whiche in the beginning was false: neither can the nouelties, or newnes of anye thing make that faise, which of it selfe is true. Hereby it is manifest, that the papistes doctrin is a doctrine of noueltie (I had almost said of diuilry) and ours a doctrine of al auncientnes the auncientest: and yet wold they carry awaye the truth with a counterfeit shew of antiquitie. And whereas also they depend so much vpon vniuersality forsooth, god be thanked, their doctrin is not so vniuersal, as they make fare of. For if ye
                nūber of thē that haue

receiued it bee compared to the number of thē that haue not receiued it, they shal seeme not to bee one for a thousande, naye not one for ten thousand. For all the Easte churche neuer receyued his doctrine, the Greeke Church neuer admitted it. The greatest parte of Italy, of Fraūce, of Flaūders, Rushia, Muscouia, Denmarke, England, Scotland, Ireland, and many other countries besides, haue vtterly cast off his Antichristian yoke & vsurped gouernment. And therefore is not his doctrine so vniuersal as he wold perswade the world. But they will saye, who shal be iudge of the truthe of our and your Doctrine betwixt vs, I aunsweare, the word of God according to this saying of our sauiour Christ. Verbum quod ego predicaui vobis iudicabit nouissimo die: The woorde that I haue preached vnto you, shall iudge in the last daye.
            But to leaue their doctrine, and to come to their liues▪ it is obiected, they liue well, and are plentifuller in good works then we, therefore their doctrine and their faithe is the truth. I aunswere there is a non sequitur or rather a mere Fallax in this argument, for good works before the world is one thing, & good workes before God is another. Those

which in the eies of the worlde seeme to bee good works, may be before god most filthy & abhominable: except they spring out of a liuely faith it is vnpossible they shuld please God, as Paule sayeth. The Iewes, the Turkes, the Paganes, and Infidels doe good workes outwardly (as it shoulde seeme) but because they are wythout Faith, they please not God. And euen suche are our Papystes good woorks: if they may be called, Good works, and not rather Ciuilia opera Ciuel woorkes or woorks of office, which the Diuelles them selues may doe. Besides this, if they doe any good workes, they are most detestable and lothsome before God, because they seeke to be iustified and saued by them, yea to merite heauen, & to make God greatly indebted and beholden vnto them. And therefore I conclude that the papists although they do neuer so many good works outwardly, yet are they but hypocritical, and no true good woorkes indeed. They erre in the nature of good works also: for those wherevpon the Lorde hath set his seale and brande of curse and malediction for euer, they call good workes: as namely the building and erecting of Abbeies, nunneries, priories monasteries, & other religious houses, guilding

of Images, erecting of Idols and statuaries in churches: creeping and offering to crosses, giuing of money to buy cups chalices, copes, & other rich ornamēts of the church. To bestow largely vpon bels, but specially vpō priests and clarks to sing masse for their soules, diriges trē
               talles, Ladyes Psalters, suppressing of Gods worde, slaying, murthering & killing of Gods Saintes for the maintenāce of their kingdom, & a thousād like, which they cal good works, but indeed are ye works of the Diuel. But such as the worde of God doth commend vnto vs for good works, as namely, to visit those that are in prison, to clothe the naked, to feed the hungry, to lodge the harbourlesse, to relieue the poore & needy, to helpe poore orphanes, widows and fatherlesse to their ryght, and such other good woorks, with them they haue nothing to do, or if they haue, they doe them in such sorte, and with such a mind, and intention, as they are not to be called good works, in respect of the end, as I haue shewed before. Thus we (see right honourable & most illustrious Lord) how they delude the worlde with their preten
                  •
               ed shew of good works and doctrine: neyther whereof are agreeable to the word of God. For as for them, they haue not,

nor will haue anye thing in the Churche but mens traditions, humaine inuentions, and vaine constitutions of corruptible men, formed and framed in the forge of their own deceiptfull brayns, whereas the Lorde speaking from heauen, saith, Hic est filius meus dilectus ipsum audite. This is my welbeloued sonne heare him, heare him. And in the Gospel after S. Matthew, our sauiour Christ saith: In vain doe they worshippe me, teaching the doctrines and traditions of men: And yet for all this they will haue nothing in the church, but the vaine traditiōs of men, cleane contrary to the word of God. And, as for their adulterate liues, if any man waigh thē in the ballaūce of impartial iudgment, he shal find them worse then the Sodomites, how soeuer they blanch them, and set a glosse vpon them, to bleare the eies of the world withal. And no maruaile, that they liue most vilely. For whē they haue done, they haue a tricke of Legerdymayn to obsolue them selues a culpa & paena, that is from the fault be it neuer so haynous, & frō the punishmēt due for the fault. Al which abuses because I haue laid thē down more at large in the further processe of this booke, I wil referre your honor to the same.
            And now (my very good Lord) to bende

to bend my style towards your honour. What shal I say? May it not be woondred, with what face I haue presumed to dedicate this woorke to your Honourable Lordeshippe rather then to many others? Truely it maye so. But two thinges in especiall haue moued me thereto: ye one, the Godly affectiō & zeale which your Lordship beareth in sacred brest to the truth of God his worde and true religion: the other the vnfayned goodwill and fidelitie which I euer haue and doe beare to that honorable house, the verie diademe and mirroure of true nobilitie. And to say truthe, to whom should one dedicate the fruites of his labours, but to such as be both learned themselues, and otherwise famous and illustrious? whiche thing (yf it be so) to whō shold I present these few blossōes of my immature studies rather then to your honorable Lordship? whose worthy fame not onely for your incomparable curtesie, affabilitie, and gentlenes towardes all men, but also and in especiall for your singular zeale to God his sacred truth, integritie of life, liberalitie towardes them that haue need, valoure, prowesse, magnanimitie, or els whatsoeuer may decore or beautifie true nobilitie, is blowen throughe out all Europe. Which brute

throughe the golden trumpe of fame, sounding in my eares, excited me the rather to present this my booke to your sacred honour, rather then to anye others: moste humblye beseechinge the same not onely to pardon my great presumption in this my bolde attempt, but also to receiue the same into your honors patronage and protection, defending as well the author from the open violence of malicious enimies, as also the booke from the slaunderous tongues of flouting Momus, and raylinge Zoilus, to whom all good thinges are had in contempte, and I shall daylie praye to God for your honorable Lordeshippe long to continue in health, and prosperity both of body and soule with increase of much honor, reward of laudable vertue, and eternall felicitie in the heauens by Iesus Christ.
            
               Your honours most humble to command Philippe Stubbes.
               
            
         
      
      
         
            
            
            The Theater of the Popes monarchy, wherein is described as wel the vncleane liues of that wicked generation, as also their Antichristian gouernment, and vsurped kingdome: together with their horrible superstition, and blasphemous religion, as it is nowe vsed at this present, where Antichrist the Pope and his members doe beare rule.
            
               The Speakers. Philemon and Stuperius.
            
               Philemon.
               
                  
                     MY friende (Stuperius) seeing it hath pleased God that we be heare mette togeather at thys present so conueniētly: let vs spend the tyme in some suche godly talke, and communication, as both maye

tend to the glory of God (for to that end chiefly was man ordeined:
                  
                     VVhy manne was created.
                  
                  ) and also to the mutual edification one of another: knowing that at the day of iudgement we must rēder accounts,
                  
                     What accoūts wee must render at the day of iudgement.
                   
                  not only for al our thoughts, words, and deeds (whether they be good or bad) but also for euery least moment of time that hath been lent vs in thys life, how we haue spent and bestowed the same.
               
            
            
               Stu.
               I am very glad (brother Philemon) to heare you so well affected. And with all my hearte, I will obeye your good aduertisement and godly request: assuring you, that I reioyce not a lyttle of such a good companion. For indeede (as you say) all our speeches ought to tende to the glory of GOD.
                     All our speeches ought to bee to Gods glory.
                   And therefore when we speake, wee ought to followe the commaundement of the Apostle, who sayeth. Si quis loquitur, vt sermo Dei loquatur. That is, If any mā speake, let him speake as the word of God teacheth him. Again, we haue an other commandement geuen vs by God himselfe in the sixt of Deuteronomie
                  
namely that we talke and commune of the worde of God, when wee rise vp in the morning,
                     VVe ought alway to talke of the woorde of God.
                   when we are at our meat, when wee lay vs downe to sleepe, when wee walke abroade by the waye, when we are at home in our houses, or whatsoeuer wee doe els, all our communication ought to be of God, and of his wō
                  derous workes. And the Apostle in another place willeth vs that our communication be such, as may giue grace to the hearers, and not offence to anye. But now adayes the cleaue contrarye is euerye where practysed. For if anye man talke of the woorde of GOD neuer so lyttle a whyle, doeth it not mouere nauseam as it were, that is, seemeth it not lothesome, when in the meane tyme too talke of bawdrye,
                     Filthy talke counted a creation.
                   of filthinesse and vncleanenesse, a whole houre, a whole daye together, yea all their liues thorow seemeth a recreation (as they cal it) and an exercyse most pleasant. But if they would remember what our sauiour Christ saith in the gospel of S. Mathew 12. chap.
                     Mat. 12. I think they would take heede what they said. De omni verbo otioso homines

reddituri sunt raetionem nouiss
                        •
                     me die. That is: Men shal giue account of euery ydle word at the day of iudgement. Againe hee telleth them that Exsermonibus suis iustificabūtur, & ex sermonibus suis condemnabuntur.
                  
                     A ca
                           •
                        eat for vncleane talkers.
                   
                  Of their wordes they shall be iustified, and of their words, they shalbe cōdemned. If they woulde bee mindeful of this, I doubt not, but they wold leaue off to interlace their speeches as they doe wyth bawdry, scurrilitie, wantonnesse, & blasphemy, with swearing, cursing, and banning, rather resembling heerein the infernall furies then sober wyse Christians.
            
            
               Phile.
               
                  You haue saide well. And therefore the Apostle Iames biddeth vs, if we be merry, to sing Psalmes, & if we be sadde or sorrowfull to pray: by whiche rule of the Apostle is forbid and condemned all filthye talke or communication contrary to the word of God,
                  
                     All filthy talke condemned.
                   
                  all vncleane woordes, wanton songues, lasciuious sonettes, bawdye ballades, and all other prophane talke whatsoeuer▪ For wherefore

did the maiestie of GOD giue vnto manne the vse of the tongue aboue all other creatures,
                  
                     VVhy God gaue man the vse of the tongue.
                   
                  but to this ende? namely, that he might gloryfie his Creator therewith, and edifie his Christian brethren? And therfore that wee may discharge our dueties, as well in the one as in the other, let vs descende intoo some particular poynts, which we may handle to the glory of God, and our mutuall edification.
               
            
            
               Stupe.
               I am wel contented, proceed in Gods name, and demaund what you will.

               To speake generally there be two Churches.
                     Two Churches.
                   to wit, the Church of God, & the Church of the Diuel: the beloued spouse of Christ, & the whoorish sinagogue of Sathan, the Electe, and the Reprobate, the vessels of saluation, & the vessels of damnation.

                   the execution of Ecclesiasticall discipline according to the prescript rule of Gods woorde, and the like. So that where thou seest these things duely & truely practised, know thou that there is the vndoubted church of God.

In another place he saith:
                     Ephe. 4.15. But let vs folowe the truth in loue, and in all things grow vp in him, which is the head, that is Christ. And to the Collossians he saith plainly thus:
                     Colos. 1.18. And hee (meaning Christ) is the head of the bodie of the Churche. Againe in the second chapter following he sayth:
                     Colos. 2.10. And yee are complete in him, which is the hear of all principalitie and power. And further in the booke of Samuel he saith:2. Sam. 22.44. Thou hast deliuered mee from the contentions of my people, thou hast preserued me to bee head ouer nations, &c. By all which places (besides infinite the like,

And althogh that Christ bee the onelie vniuersall & peremptorie head of his Church, yet my meaning is not to denie Christian Princes that lawefull power and authoritie which ye word of god doth alow thē:
                     Howe princes are heads ouer the church of God.
                   that is to be the chief heads ouer euery seuerall Church or congregation, and ouer

euery particular person and member of the same, within theyr kingdomes and dominions as his Lieuetenaunts, and Uicegerents vnder hym, to rule and gouerne the people of God by the rule and scepter of his worde.

               In deede the Pope (I will not denie) is Supreame head ouer the vniuersall Church vpon the earth:
                     The pope head ouer ye churche of Satan.
                   but of what vniuersall Church? Of the Catholike or vniuersal church of satā (acording to my former diuisiō). Of this malignant church I confes he is the only Supreme head. But ouer the church of God,
                     The pope no head ouer the church of god, nor any member of the same.
                   the Spouse of Christe Iesus, hee is so farre from beeing head, that hee is not so much as a perfect member of the same: For proofe whereof, doe marke but thys one reason: he that impugneth the worde of God, and the doctrine of Christ Iesus wittyngly and willynglie is no true member of Christe Iesus. But the Pope (as the worlde beareth witnesse)

in all his Actes, Dooinges, and Proceedynges generally, impugneche the woorde of GOD both wittinglye and willingly, ergo, neither hee nor any of hys Adherents are the true members of the mysticall bodie of Christe Iesus.
               And notwythstandinge,

But howe falsly hee arrogateth this superioritye to hymselfe, euery manne (except wilfullie blynde) maye perceyue. For is not the Church of GOD,

howe dareth he challendge to be head ouer another mans wife? Is he not a verlet, that will require it? and is not the wife a harlot that will permit it? And is not that a monstrous bodye, whiche hath moe heads then one? Therefore co conclude, Christ Iesus is the only Supreme head of the Churche,

                   The Pope giueth the twoo crosse keyes, which hee calleeh (falsly) Saint Peters keies. These keyes hee blaseth very richly in golde and siluer Scutchins, thereby the rather to perswade the worlde, that neither Emperour,

Then hauing prooued that hee was there, and that hee was Pope there also, yet helpeth it him not, excepte hee can prooue that Peter gaue it him eyther by wyll, Deede of gyfte, Feaftmente, or some other lawefull graunte, whereby hee maie wyth good conscience inioye that, whiche both Christe Iesus, the blessed Apostle Saint Peter, and all the reste of the Apostles in generall did alwayes refuse.

what other hidden meanes it may come vnto him, whether by lineal discent, by hereditarie possession, or by what other conueiance.

                     The Popes whelpes.
                   than wyll I say more vnto them: in the meane time I rest perswaded that hee is so farre from hauing any power in or ouer,
                     The no pope mēber of the church of god.

                     The spiritual keies of the kingdome of heauen.
                   that Peter receyued the Spirituall Keyes of the kingdome of heauen, that is, the power of bindyng, and loosing of sins, togeather with the power and gyfte of expoundinge, interpretynge, and explaning of the holy Scriptures to the people. And not onely did Peter receiue these keyes, but also all the reste of the Apostles wythe hym, and in

them, all other faithfull Preachers, Pastours, Doctours, and Ministers of the Gospell as effectually, as fully, and as amplie as the Apostles themselues.
            
            
               Phile.
               
                  What is meant by these keies?
               
            
            
               Stupe.
               A key (yee knowe) is an instrument that men vse, to open, and to shut withall.
                     VVthat is ment by the keies.
                   Therefore is this Metaphor borrowed thereof: by which keyes is meant potestas soluendi, & ligandi, the power of bynding and loosing: as I tolde you before in the Page precedent.
            
            
               Phile.
               
                  How is binding, & loocing perfourmed?
               
            
            
               Stupe.
               By preaching of the lawe, and the Gospel, as for example. When the lawe is preached, and the fearefull threates, and comminations therof thundred foorth against any impenitent sinner, then may hee bee saide to be bounden, and his sinnes to bee retained. And when the glad tidings of the Gospel is preached too the penitent, and contrite sinner,
                     How binding and loosing is perfourmed.
                   then may he be saide to be loosed and his sinnes to be remitted.
               
                  Again, when any one ariseth against the Maiestie of GOD, and rebelleth against his lawes and commaundements without eyther remorse of conscience, feare of God, intention of amendement, or repentaunce at all, this man is bounden, and his sinnes retayned. But vpon the other side, if hee sinne of frailtie, and afterwarde truelie repenteth, amendeth, and turneth too the Lorde wythall hys hearte,
                     Howe wee are saide to bee bound and loosed.
                   wyth an intention neuer to committe the same offence againe, and constantly beléeuing in Iesus Christe trusting too bee saued and pardoned by his death, then is hee loosed, and hys sinnes cleerely put away and remitted. In this sorte, and in this case hath euerie faithfull Pastour and Preacher of the Gospell, full, absolute, and Plenarie power too binde the impenitent sinner,
                     Howe the Ministers of the gospel haue power to remit sinne.
                   that is, to pronounce hym by the warraunt of Gods worde, to be bound, and to loose him agayne, that is, to pronounce hym by the woorde of God too bee loosed when hee repenteth, and turneth to the Lorde with all his hearte, as I haue saide.
               
                  Thus ye see the power of the keies, that is,
                     Binding and loosing restrained within the compasse of Gods worde.
                   of bynding, and loosing, is restrayned within the Pale and wall of Gods woorde, and not in suche a lauish maner, and raunging sorte as pleasethe Magister noster, our greate Master the Pope too determine. For if it were true, or coulde bee prooued, that the Pope hadde this Plenarie power, too bynde and loose whome hee would wythout the warraunt of the woorde of GOD, then woulde I not blame them yf all the worlde wente after him, and not onely worshypped hym as a manne, but as a GOD vppon earthe. Is it any maruaile though hee hath withe thys Sweete Bayte,
                     The popes venemous hook and poysone bayte.

But nowe (GOD bee thanked) they beeing better instructed in the woorde of GOD, and seeynge hys horrible Blasphemie, Superstition, Idolatrie, and euen Diuelrie it selfe, haue the most of them made Defection, and shrunke from hym.

And dayly doe they fall from his Antichristian kingdom,

               Stupe.
               You saye the trueth.
                     Gods worde the ouerthrow of the Popes kingdome.
                   But if the worde of God shoulde once bee set a; broch, and come to light, then (he knoweth it verye well) his kingdome of ignoraunce, and darknesse woulde soone decay and come to naught. And therefore to the end that he may the better maynteine his kingdome of ignoraunce, hee clappeth vppe the Byble,
                     The Pope forbiddeth the reading of the Scriptures.
                   forbidding all men whatsoeuer to reade it, or once to looke one worde vpon it, and that vppon payne of damnation: saying further that none ought to looke vpon it, but he and his rabbynes, or such others as he shal license and authorize therto by his bulles of dispensation. This is cleane contrary to the doctrine of our sauiour Christ, who biddeth vs searche the Scriptures saying.
                     The Popes doctrine contrary to Christes.
                   
                  Scrutamini Scripturas eae sunt enim qui testificantur de me. Whiche is, Searche the scriptures, for those are they that beare witnesse of me. In an other place, he saith, Scrutamini scripturas, in eis enim speratis vitam eternam

habere.
                  
                     Al men ought to search the Scriptures.
                   That is, search the scriptures, for in them you hope to haue eternal life. This is contrary to the example of the Birreans in the Actes of the Apostles,
                     Birreans their notable example.
                   who searched the scriptures dayly to see whether the things preached by the Apostles were true, or not. Nowe whether it bee better to obeye Christe who commandeth vs to search the scriptures or the Pope, who forbiddeth vs the sight of them, iudge you. And to the ende that he may bee sure to keepe the worlde in Cymmeriis tenebris, in palpable darknesse, & grosse ignoraunce stil, (for ignorance he calleth the mother of deuotion,
                     Ignoraunce the mother of damnation not of deuotion.
                   whereas indeede it may well bee called the mother of damnatiō) he not only locketh vp the byble vnder strong lockes, & keyes, but also turneth it into a straunge tongue,
                     Bible locked vp and in a strange toung.
                   contrary to the doctrine both of our sauiour Christe his blessed Apostle Paul, who commandeth that al thinges be done in the Church to edification,
                     1. Cor. 14.
                   & in a knowen tongue: & also to the example of the Prymitiue and Apostolicall Church, who euer vsed to haue the bible, and other diuine bookes, in the mother

tongue, which they vnderstoode. And as though this restraint were not badde ynough, he giueth in charge that no man be so bolde as to interprete or expounde the scriptures,
                     Scripture to be no otherwise interpreted, then pleaseth the Pope.
                   otherwise then hee shall think meet in his commentaries, gloses, and paraphrases. Thus he woulde bee thought too haue all knowledge in his breast (for so som of his Sorbonisis haue writtē of him, that in scrinto pectoris Papae cōditur omnis scientia, that is, In the chest of the popes breast, lieth hid all knowledge whatsoeuer) & to be onely wise,
                     The pope would be thought onely wise.
                   & al the world besides to be blind as betles, & to see, or know nothing. Under which gay pretēce of wisedom & knowledge, whatsoeuer he deereeth must stād for an infallible & an vndoubted truth: no man must ask any questiō of it, but what soeuer he cōmandeth be it right or wrōg, truth or falshood, it must be obeied forthwith vpon payn of damnation. And why not?
                     Nether the Pope nor his Father the Diuell canne erre.
                   for whatsoeuer he speaketh, yea althogh he but dreme it, it is truth forsooth, & so m
                     •
                  st al mē take it: for he is the onely felow vpon ye earth that cannot erre, neither in life, nor doctrine, no more thā the diuel himself.
            
            
               
               Phile.
               
                  Euery man may count him but an Asse in so deeming of himself, for the holy Ghost teacheth vs, that Omnis homo mendax, solus Deus verax, that is: Euery man is a lier, and God onely is true. Therefore if hee bee a man (but I rather think him a Diuel incarnate) he must needes erre: For hominis est errare, labi, & decipi: It is naturally giuen to euery man to erre, to fall away, & to be deceiued. But notwithstanding they holde (as I heare say) that he is not a plaine or naked man as other men be,
                  
                     The Pope a deyfied creature and no man.
                   
                  but a diuine creature, deified with the Godhead, and euen as it were a God hym selfe, and therefore cannot erre. But Peter of whom he so much braggeth, & whose successor he boasteth himselfe to be,
                  
                     Peter denied hys Mayster thrise.
                   
                  when the Lord had taken hys grace from him for a time, denied his maister, not once, nor twise, but iii. times. Christe called him an other time bar Satana the sonne of the diuell, saying come after mee sathan, thou sauorest not those thyngs whiche are of GOD, but of men. By all

which reasons (with infinite the lyke which might be alleadged, if eyther tyme would permit me, or the necessitie of the cause required the same) it manifestly appeareth, that the pope not only doth erre simply both in life and doctrine,
                  
                     The Pope erreth in all things.
                   
                  but also erreth most grossely, and moste shamefully in al thinges.
               
            
            
               Stupe.
               Nay, but he hath prouided a cooling card for them that shal so iudge of him. For, be his doings, his whole life, & doctrine neuer so detestable, yet maye none be so bolde,
                     The Popes cooling carde.
                   as to iudge of thē. And his reason (or cooling card) is this. Qui omnium viuentium iudex constitutus est, a nemine est iudicandus, that is, He who is appointed to bee the iudge of all men, ought to bee iudged of none. No although hee draw infinite millions of men,
                     No man may iudge of the Pope.
                   and women to hell, by his wycked example of life, yet may no manne iudge of hym for it. Thus raigneth hee vpon earth as one, neither fearing God, nor yet reuerencing man. And why not? For this is a maxime in his law,

               Stupe.
               Yes truly. And not without great cause, for as they say, he is of such a wonderfull power,
                     The greate power of our Maister Pope.
                   that of wrong he can make righte, of falsehood truth, of iniustice, iustice, of lighte, darkenesse, of darknes light, and when his holinesse is pleased he can make the swanne blacke, and the crowe white. Hee can also diuorce those whom the lawe of God hath ioyned togeather, and againe whom the law of God hath diuorced, he can ioyne together. He can dispēce either with the law of God, or of man, breaking, allowing, or disalowing what pleaseth his humor. Subiects he cā discharge frō their allegeance to their prince.
                     The Pope must haue a share in euery thing.
                   He also licenseth, & dispenseth wt al kind of the euery,

robbery, whordom murther, māslaughter, or els what abhomination soeuer, so that his share may be therin, which you may be sure is not the smallest parte.

                  This follow seemeth rather a monster in nature then a man, that thus dareth peruerte all thinges to serue his own turne.

               If you knew al, you would say so. For he taketh into his handes the whole power, and state of Caesar, & therfore writeth he himselfe heire apparant to the Empire.
                     The Pope heire apparent to the Emperour.
                   And to this purpose hee hath perswaded emperors, kings, & princes that he may & ought so to do iure diuino, that is, by force of gods law, whiche seemeth most monstrous. Wherin if any do resist him, then putteth he them in feare, & threatneth thē with his absolute power in heauen,
                     The Popes fray bugge.
                   earth & hel, & with excōmunication, & other his flashing thunderbolts of cōmination. Yea to this passe hath he brought it, yt neither Emperour, king, nor Prince is lawfullye crowned, which is not crowned by him:
                     The Pope crowneth emperours with his feete.
                   & as thogh his holy hands were too good to set the crown vpō their heads, he crowneth thē
                  
(for the most part) with hys toes, they laying their heades downe vppon the grounde.
                     The Pope deposeth kynges and Emperors when hee ly

                   Hee also maketh and putteth downe Emperours, kinges and princes at his pleasure. So that if any one dysplease his holinesse, he is by and by throwen downe as low as hell, deposed from his regal dignitie, his crowne plucked of his head, and scepter out of his hands, excommunicate, and an other put in hys place. And thē if it fortune that this king so deposed doe rise in armes to defende his people, his countrie, and his owne right, then rayseth he vp other kings, & Princes against hym: So that were he otherwise neuer so mightie of hymself, yet shall hee not bee able to preuayle against them all. Upon the other side, if he referre his cause to a general Counsel to be decyded there,
                     No generall counsell can be gathered with out the Pope.
                   it booteth not. For there is no Councell that can be gathered without his consent, and allowance of the same. Neyther maye they determine, or decree any thing but what shall sound pleasant in hys eares. And then the small end of all is,
                     The next way for kinges to come by theyr owne at the popes hands.
                   and the next waye for the kinges and Princes deposed, to

come by their dignities again, to submit themselues, bodies, landes, goodes, people, countrey, life and all into the Popes handes, to aske forgiuenesse, and falling downe vpon their knees, too prostrate themselues, and kisse his feete in hope of grace. This done, then peraduenture if he wil giue money ynough he shall bee restored to hys kyngdome agayne.

                   whose neck the Pope proudly stampe vpon as though he had bin, a beast. There was also another pope, who vsed to makkings & Emperours his blocks to stand vpon, when he mounted vpon his horse. Some kings must hold his styrrops,
                     Kynges made footstooles to the pope.
                   other some (on either side one at the least) must lead his horse by the bridle thorow thicke and thinne.
                     Kings holding the popes styrrops.
                   And thus maketh hee all men, both Emperours, kings & princes euen all in generall subiecte vntoo

him, in the meane time he himselfe beeyng subiect to none. And yet notwithstanding, there is nowe, neither emperor, king, nor prince, that dares mute against him, but him they obey as sole lord of heauen & earth.
                     None dares mute against the pope.
                   Whatsoeuer he commaundes, they dare not but fulfil. In so much that if he command them to make warre against the coūtrey, people, or nation, thē gather they their troups & legions of armed men to gether, & forwarde they go, sacking, spoyling and burning both cities, towns, & countries. And imbruing their hands in the blood of poore innocentes,
                     The popes mercy in shedding of blood.
                   they slaye and kill euen all without mercy, man, woman, and child, putting all too the edge of the swoorde most cruelly too beholde. And this they must doe. Why? Because the Pope commands thē so to do: whose commandement whether it bee wrong or ryght aboue all thynges in the Worlde is to bee obeyed in euerye poynt without exception.
            
            
               Phil.
               
                  This is an intollerable slauery, and seruilitye, I maruell that euer christian princes will suffer thēselues

so to be abused, and that of a greasie prelate.
               
            
            
               Stupe.
               Nay, he proceedeth further, & as though the former abuses were not sufficyent, hee maketh the lawes, the Courtes,
                     Al courts subiecte too the pope.
                   and Offices of kynges and Prynces subiect vnto hym: So that if any man dislyke of the lawes, & Courtes of their Prynces, he maye frankely, and freely make his appeale to the pope,
                     Appeale to the court of Rome
                   and Court of Rome. By which meanes hee raketh in moneye not a lyttle euerye yeere.

                  Is it possible that princes will put vp this iniurie at his hands, and not bee reuenged? I praye you how doth hee behaue himselfe towardes them, that they rise not vppe against him, and pull him out of hys kingdom by the eares?

               He feedes their humors he speaketh pleasant things vnto them,
                     The popes profession.
                   hee flattereth & fawneth vpon them in such sort as he makes them beleeue the moone is of green cheese, and so it is indeede, if he say so. But for feare of the woorst, and for further safegarde of hys personne,

hee entreth intoo league with all suche kings & princes of euery coūtrey,
                     The pope enreth League wyth kings & princes, and why.
                   as are of any great force & power, least (happily) they might indanger his estate, incase they shoulde resist his Maiesties person. And if it happen that at anye tyme hee want money,
                     VVhat shyfte the pope maketh when he lackes money. The popes beagles doe hunte for money.
                   and knoweth not howe to come by any, then sendeth he foorth hys Embassadours, his Legates, his Suffraganes, and hys Cardynals into all landes, thorow whose diligent industry he setteth kings and princes together by the eares: and beyng at bloody warres amongst themselues, then wil he be sure to take parte with him that is the stronger: be it wrong or right that maketh no matter: for of wrong he can make right. Alwayes prouyded that in all spoyles,
                     The popes share.
                   prayes, bootyes, and escheates, he haue the greatest share, for that is the thinge that hee desires,
                     The mark the pope leueleth at.
                   and the onely marke that hee shootes at. Thus hee feedeth hymselfe wyth the blood of the poore innocent Lambes, contrarye both to the law of God,
                     The pope thirsteth for blood
                   and his own calling, which is to saue blood and not to shed innocent blood.

such feasting and banqueting,

               What? Cruelty doe you call it? No, it is not crueltie. You maye not flaunder our holye father so. Doe you not knowe that of cruelty,
                     The popes metamorphosis.
                   he can make lenity, and of lenity cruelty, changing any thing intoo the nature of another at his pleasure? And although he rid thē of their liues in this world (which of force they must once leaue, if he were not) yet cā he send thē packing into heauen when hee will: and so haue they made a good change, haue they not? Or if they goe to hell, euen thyther sends he hys power down, with charms & solemne ceremonies, which reach euen vnto the smoaky pit it self,
                     The popes power sent into hell.
                   & vnto the burning lake of the

same. By means wherof althogh he can not peremptorily loose the dāned soules from their cheynes, nor free them from theyr payns, nor although he he not able to breake the turning wheeles, to kil the dreadfull snake, to coole ye boyling ledd, nor to quench the flaming fire, yet cā he ease & make lesser their paines by farre. And which is more, som write that, whē he wil, such is his absolute power) he can bring to passe that the fire of hell cannot burne,

And if the dyuel anger him muche, or it chaunce too rayne a golden showre, he will empty hell in spite of the Diuelles heade, and sende them wyth a pasporte into Heauen, whether God will or not. And why may he not doe this? For hath hee not the keyes of Heauen gates, and may he not open and shut them when he wyll? Nowe he that can doe these thyngs, may he not play the Rex wel ynough? And is he not worthy to be made of,

                  Yea truly. And as I remember one of his whelpes hath thus written of him.
                  
                     The pope better then God.
                   
                  Papa deo maior & praestātior est, & quicquid potest deus, idē & Papa. That is the Pope is greater and better thā God & looke whatsoeuer god cā do, the same can the pope do. Yea & some of them say, that he can do more thē God. For say they, God cannot make God,
                  
                     The pope can do that God cannot doe.
                   
                  but the pope can make God when hee will, & therfore must he needs be not only a god, but also more than a God. I praye you therefore what authority and power hath he elswhere more than this?
               
            
            
               Stupe.
               Besides his power in heauē, earth, & hell, he hath also power in another place called Purgatory nullibi,
                  
                     Purgatory. Nullibi.
                   or Purgatory pickepurse choose you whether, a place which neither God nor ye diuel euer knew of, til he of late founde it out, & yet for all that cānot he himself tel where it is, nor in what part it is adiacēt. But in this place he rules ye rost, he is rector chori, the leder of the daūce there, and none rules but hee alone. In thys broyling fire muste euerye soule that

                     The pope saith euery soule must be punished 7. yeeres in purgatorie for euery sinne that euer he cō

                   for euery sin that euer he committed in al his life, whether they be small or great, except they bee released by his meanes. And therefore teacheth he the people to giue money to Friers, Monkes,
                     The Popes merchandize.
                   and Priestes too say Masses, Diriges, Trentalles, Ladie Psalters, Himmes, Prayers, Orisons, Exorsizations, and the like for the soules in Purgatorie: which as sone as euer they be said,
                     So sone as money rings in the boxes, ye soules in purgatorye feele ease.
                   the soules feele wonderful great ease thereby: yea of such force are they that so soone as euer the money ringeth in the boxe, the soules receiue comfort. And if money come in freely, hee will not sticke too graunt you foorth suche a generall pardon and indulgence,
                     Money wyll sweepe Purgatory cleane.
                   as shal sweepe all Purgatorie cleane. And beeyng once graunted forth (they cary such meale in mouth as they saye) neither Pluto,

                  I perceiue his power is marueilous great, & farre surpassing the power of any earthly wight els. I pray you with what maner of attyre and habite is he clothed? For seeing, that he excelleth all men in power, & dignitie, it seemeth incident too his maiesticall estate, that hee bee richlier clothed then all other men.
               
            
            
               Stupe,
               In sumptuous robes, and ryche attyre, there may no earthly creature compare with him. For when he is desposed to bee seene abrode, he is cladde al ouer from toppe to tooe, (as they say)

in purple coloure,
                     The popes attyre.
                   in silkes, veluets, sattans, damaskes, and withall, in cloath of golde, siluer, and tinsell, besette aboute wyth all kynde of pretious Stones from India, and from all the coastes of the worlde. Than vpon his head hath he a Triple crowne all of perfecte golde,
                     A triple crown
                   hanged with Diademes, Carbuncles, Smaradges, Saphyres, Pearles, and all kinde of precious Stones glistring like the Sun.
                     The popes crosier.
                   His crosier then & double crosse of gold is carried solemnly before him, he bring garded behind and before with swarmes of Cardinals,
                     The popes gard.
                   Monkes, Friers, Priestes, and an infinit number of harnished men marching in battaile aray: besides these things, they haue their strange gestures,
                     The strange gestures of the papists.
                   aswel with hande and foote, as with head and shoulders, & all parts of their body, which to see & mark wold make a man to laugh that hath but one laughter in his belly.
                     All thinges the pope cōmeth nere are holy.
                   And in suche veneration is this holy father hadde, that the ground whereupō he standeth or goeth, is takē to be holy ground, all things that he handleth or commeth neere, yea if hee but tooke vppon it with his holy eyes, it is straight way holy.
               
                  In this order marcheth this holy satanist towardes the Temple or Church carryed a wonderfull height vpō mens shoulders,
                     The pope carried on mens shoulders.
                   euen as the sacred Arke of Aaron was, wherein the hiden Manna lay. Compare nowe all thinges whiche this great Antichrist the Pope doth, with the doings and actions of our Sauiour Christe, and thou shalt see no analogie, resemblance, or agreement betwixte them, but rather a playne Antithesis, and contrarietie.
                     The great differēce betwixt Christ and the Pope.
                   Christe Iesus when he was vpon the earth, lyued in pouertie, and meane estate. The pope lyueth in wealth, and abundance of all things. Christe Iesus had neither siluer nor gold, and therefore when hee should pay tribute was forced to flie to a myracle to get a penie, The Pope hath Millions of golde, and mountaines of siluer by him. Christ Iesus commaunded hys Apostles that they should not carry money in their purses, nor two coates for their backs: and that they should preach the worde freely.
                     The pope wyll none of that.
                   The Pope commaundeth the cleane contrarie, insomuch that it is grown into a Prouerb, No Penie,

no Pater noster. Christe Iesus went on foote long and tedious iourneies,
                     If the Pope should goe on foote, it would hurte hym, for hee is so fatte, that it would fry and melt hys grease wythin hym.
                   so that he being wearie was forced to rest him at the well of Iacob, about the sixte houre of the day, that is twelue of the clocke after the Computation of the Iewes. The Pope hee is carried on mens shoulders too too goodly, and rydeth in sumptuous Wagons, Charets, Quoches, Horselitters and the like, beeing all either of pure golde or siluer, or els of some other costly thing, behanged with pretious stones, cloth of golde, veluet, silke, damaske, Satten, and what not els seemely to beholde. Christ Iesus was glad to weare a crowne of thornes vpon his head,
                     But the Pope meanes not to change hys crown of gold for Christes crowne of thornes.
                   pricking him to the brain pan. The Pope weareth a triple crown all of golde, and pretious stones, betokening his threefolde power in heauen, earth, and hell, wherein wee thinke the Pope is much deceiued. For as he hath power in heauen, in earth, in hel, and in Purgatorie,
                     The Pope ought to wear a quadruple crowne.
                   so he shoulde weare a quadruple crowne, too signifie his absolute power in them all. And therefore would I wishe some of his Bastardes to tel his

holines of his great ouersight, and to amend it in time. And thus too conclude, thou seest by these fewe comparisons betwixt Christ and the Pope, what agreement there is betweene them, as muche as is betwixt light, and darkenes, truth and falshood, heate, and cold, God, & the Diuel, heauen, and hell. And therefore mayest thou know that hee is that great Antichrist that was forespoken of, shuld come towardes the ende of the worlde,
                     The pope proued antichrist.
                   whom the Lorde shall destroy with the glory of his comming.
            
            
               Phile.
               
                  It is greatly to bee wondered at, howe he commeth by money to maintaine this great cost, and stately porte withall?
               
            
            
               Stupe.
               Neuer wonder at that: for neither emperour, king, nor prince hath such store of Gold in their chestes, as he hath. For besides his owne inheritance which is both far & broad, he hath frō all the parts in Christendom (almost) taxes, tallages,
                     The popes exactions too mayntayne his pride.
                   cōtributiōs, tenths, tithes, Peter pence (as he calleth thē) & other greuous impositions not a few, al which by most intollerable exaction he vsurpeth:

hee hath also belōging to his pretensed patrimonie, both cities, townes, countries & natiōs, castles & towres, besides hauēs, ports, sinques, & creekes, wherby he gaineth yerely 1000 talents & more to his cofers, Beyond al this, he gaineth as much or more, by graūting pardōs, & indulgences, by pardoning & remitting sin,
                     Pardons & indulgences.
                   by giuing forth dispensations, qualifications, tot quots, pluralities, non residentaries, anuates, & like deuises infinite. Besides this, by his pelting palles,
                     The gayn that commes in too the pope by pelting palles.

                  meth by money enough too support hys estate withal, hauing so many wayes to gaine by? Insomuch that Pope Iohn 22. after his discese left 25. millions,
                     The tresure of Rome infinite.
                   or 25. times a thousande thousande of crownes in redie money behind him, besides what he spent vpon whores,
                     That was not the least part I warrant you.
                   bauds, and knaues, in pride, ryot, gluttonie, and excesse during his life.
               
                  In the time of Pope Martin 5. there was brought too Rome 9. Millions of golde at one time out of Fraunce, which is 9. times a thousand thousand crowns,
                     Oh extreeme polyng.
                   for Benefices, and other Ecclesiasticall promotions, whereat the Archbishop of Madenbourgh admiring said, Iudicet timoraius, quae verago haec:
                  
                     Rome a deuouryng gulphe.
                   that is, Lette a wise man iudge, what a deuouring gulph the Citie of Rome is. Al things as I tolde you before are sold for money at Rome, and therefore Iohn Picus writeth thus,
                     Al thyngs sold at Rome for money.
                   
                  Vendit Alexander, cruces altaria Christum, vendere iure potest, emerat ille prius: that is, Alxander the pope selleth crosses, altares, yea, and Christe himselfe also, and why not? For, saith he, hee bought all before with his money? Whereto agreeth Baptista Mantuanus, a Monk writing thus: Venalia nobis templa, Sacerdotes, altaria, sacra, coronae: ignis, thura, praeces coelum est venale, Deus

hee concludeth thus and saith,
                     The wickednes & corruption of Rome described.
                   
                  Viuire qui sanctè cupitis, discedite Roma, omnia cum liceant, non licet esse pium: that is, All that desire to liue in the feare of God get you from Rome: for wheras all other things are lawfull there, yet is it not lawefull too bee good there.

                     How the pope spendeth hys money.
                   Seminaries, Monastaries, Churches, casteles, and towres (wherin he wil be sure to place his deare friends kinsmen, and familiars) it is infinite and vnmeasurable. Thus briefly hast thou hearde what the Pope is, and howe Luciferlike he liueth: nowe iudge thou whether he be the same that he wold be thought to bee, and not rather Antichrist himselfe. And therefore I cannot but maruaile greatly at the blindnes of the worlde,
                     The pope vnholy.
                   who either effectionate him so muche, or yet thinke him to be holye, whereas of himselfe you see, hee is nothing lesse. But belike hee takethe hys holinesse of the place and Sea of Rome which if it wer true that the place could make an vnholy man,
                     The place cannot make a manne good, vvhiche before is nought.
                   holy, or a naughty man good, then should it follow that all that haue been at Rome, shoulde bee as holy as the Pope, which were blasphemie to say.
                     The Diuel holier then the pope.
                   And then why shoulde not the Diuell be holy, yea and holier than the Pope, for that hee was in a holier place then Rome is: namelye, the kingdome of heauen. And thus muche concerning the pontificall person, state,

and dignitie of the Pope, the great Antichriste of the worlde. Nowe to speake a worde or two of Cardinals the chiefest pillers of this antichristiā vsurped kingdome.

                        The maner of the Popes Byshops.
                      sauing that they carry not such a great port, and statelye sway as the other doe: els they are like them in all kynd of wickednesse. Fyrste of all, they take vpon them names, and tytles proper to kings, princes & Lords. They be stowt,
                        The proude humors of the Bishoppes of Rome.
                      proud and disdainefull, looking not onely for capp and knee of euerye man, but euen for kneeling and

crowchyng downe to the ground. They haue great Bishoprickes worth by estymation two or three thousand pounds by yeere, wherto belong both castles & towers, wy
                        •
                     h cities, countries, and townes. They haue also the rule & gouernment of Abbies, granges, nunneries, priories, personages, vicarages, & all other kynd of Ecclesiasticall benefices & spirituall promotions wherof they feed thēselues (for chāge of pasture is good for thē) wt the daintiest morsels.
                        The fat morsels of Romish Bishops.
                      Being thus furnished with abundance of all things, commonly they lye in some strōg castle, sytuat in a solitary place, wher they preach as strawberies vse to grow,
                        VVhere the romish bishops lye.
                      that is once a yere, nay happily not once in 7. yeres. And to say truth, as they say, it needeth not,
                        Blynking Syr Iohns,
                      for they haue their blincking Syr Iohns, their begging Friers, Monks, & cloysterers that do it for thē. These blind buzzards,
                        Friers &c. the popes spanyels.
                      and Assye peisants being sent forth by their Bishops, set abroach with all their might, the popes decrees, ceremonies, & orders: in the meane time not forgetting to declaim against heretikes, that is against such as put their confidence

and trust in Christ Iesus alone, & his sacred trueth.
                        The papystes take 
                              •
                            greate heed least they preach anye truth.
                      But aboue all things, they take greate care least anye of them might at vnawares preach any truth out of the woord of God, for that were Heresie to God, and treason to the Popes person. For if they shoulde preache the trueth (beeing sworne to maintaine the pope against Christ Iesus,
                        Oh damnable othe.
                      & his woord) then might they be attainted of periury, and besides accused of heresie. Thus neither Bishoppe, nor prelate sworne to the pope,
                        None of the papistes dare preach Christ Iesus aryght.
                      dares preach Christ Iesus aright: for that were too destroye theyr proude Antichristian kingdom, which consisteth only of lies, falshood, murther, treason, vsurpatiō, & rebellion. Insomuch that a good bishop of Coleyne seing what wickednes vnder the visard and pretence of of godlines was daily cōmitted:
                        The example of the bishopp of Coleyn, who rather forsooke hys Bishoprick thē to dyshonour Christ Iesus, as the papistes did.
                      begā to discouer & lay opē their impieties, blasphemies & trecheries: but he was resisted of al, euery barking frier whetted his pē against him, & like serpētine vipers stūg him euē to the death. Wel, report hereof cōming to Rome, ye pope assēbled a coū
                     cel, & cited this good old father to appere

before him. Who seeyng their wycked intentions against him, gaue ouer his bishopricke, rather choosing wythout it, to preach Christ Iesus truly, then wyth it to dishonour him euery waye, as they did. These blockheaded popish byshops, as blinde as blynd bayardes,
                        The Papistes say preaching is not necessary.
                      thinke, yea and shame not say that preaching is not necessary, and that the people doe learne more by their dumb ceremonies, imageries, and other bableries, then they do by hearing the word of God preached. And indeede I think no lesse, for whereas by the worde of God preached they learne the way to saluation,
                        By hearinge the worde of God preached men learn the pathwaye too heauen, by papistry the path way to hell.
                      and life eternal, by imageries and other popish ceremonies, they learn the pathway to hell, and euerlasting damnation. And therefore they learn more by the one, than by the other. But more what? more wickednesse and sin. But notwithstanding their seldome preaching, yet when they doe preache, it shalbe commonly vpon some popish holiday, or festiual day of their own inuention, which is alwayes of greater estimation amōgst them, then the Lords day, to wit, the Sabboth day is. In this

their Pope holy day, what Idolatrye is committed, what superstition is practysed, and what grosse blasphemies,
                        Idolatry committed vppon popish holydayes.
                      & filthy absurdities are permitted, and exercised of them, it is almost vnspeakeable. Then, euen then, is there such censing, and singing, such masking and rynging, such chaunting, and roaryng, in the quyre, wyth Orgayns playing, and musicke soundyng, that thou wouldest rather thynke it a Satyricall stage playe of fooles consecrated to the Diuel, than a sober seruice of wisemen instituted to G

or veluet, his amias & his albe as white as snow, hanging down to his shoe. About his loynes he gyrdeth himself with a gyrdle of silke. About his neck is there a stoale, wrought for the greatest part of very good silk:

                      now there, nowe the Chalice, nowe the Paxe, nowe the Booke, nowe one thing, then an other. Then hauing fisked in thys sort about the altare ynough, at the last he comes to the myddest or Centre of the same, and there hee maketh an ende of hys playe. Sometime he standeth hanging downe the head,
                        The bishop in a brown study
                      as though he were in a browne study, mumbling to him selfe no manne knoweth what.
                  Sometime he ioyneth both his hands together vpon the Altar,

                      somtime he lifteth them vp towards heauen, sometime he spreaddeth them towards the North, sometime towards the South, somtime towards the east, & somtime towards the west. One while he pattereth & blesseth, an other while he crosseth and censeth, fearing belike lest any saucy spirit, shuld come neere to deface his doings. Uppon the otherside his ministers are readye to

lay cushiōs of silk,
                        For flesh vpon his backe hee hath none and therefore hath need of cushyons.
                      or cloth of gold vnder his elbowes to lean vpon, vnder his buttoc as to sit vppon, & vnder his feete too stand vpon. After these things thus set in order, the bishop calleth for frankencēse, censors, sweet odours, candles, crosses, banners, & the like trumpery, which being brought, then falleth he to kissing & smearing the altar, & altar stone, as a soueraigne thing. Besides one standeth behind the bishop to see ye nothing be wanting, holding vppe the patin inclosed in silke. Thus al thinges ended, the bishop eateth, and drynketh vppe all himselfe, not giuing anye parte to anye present. Which done the Satyre or Pageant, is perfected and ended.
                        The papistes delude the world wyth gewgawes.
                      Now seest thou with what gewgawes, these beetle headed papistes, doe delude the worlde, and dazle the eyes of the simple.
                  Besides this, there are some of these bishoppes, that will not blushe too haue a swoorde carryed before them, and placed vppon the holye Altare,
                        A sword carried before popish bishops to the high altar, and why.
                      too the ende that menne maye knowe theyr magnyficall power, and so both feare, and reuerence them the more. Thus

they will bee both kinges, and priestes themselues alone, whether God wyll or not. Othersome there are, that will not take this paines vppon them, but couet rather too bee conuersaunt in Kynges Courtes, hoping thereby to attaine too greater promotion,
                        Byshops conuersant in kinges courts.
                      then by poring vpon a booke, and preaching of Christ Iesus. Where, by that time, that they haue bin a while, they fead humours so excellently, & are so skilfull in the eyght lyberall science (to wit, the noble art of flattery, and assentation) that in short space, they are admitted to be of the priuy councel,
                        Popish bishops skilful in the art of flattery.
                      without whose knowledge, consent, & agreement, nothing can be set forth, or established. In parliamentes they gyue theyr Councels, and rule all the rowte, euen at their pleasures.

These Popishe Byshoppes also are iustices of peace, iustices of Quorum, of heire determiner, and assyses, yea and Iudges of lyfe and death, for the most parte.

                  Oh: no. None but Archbyshops,

and metropolitanes only. For if euery inferior bishop should haue another bishop vnder him, that were a great inconuenience, and woulde burthen the church of God too much.

Manye other toyes & knacks belong to this suffragans office, which for tediousnes I omit.

               The manner of hallowing of Churches, and Churcheyardes, as it is now vsed amongest the papistes.
               
                  Stuperius.
                  FIrst of all, the sexten lurketh secretly in some corner of the churche,
                        The order of the Papists hallowing of churches & church yardes.
                      all others being thruste foorth, & the church doores fast closed, then are there twelue tapers set burning before the Altar, and as many before ye crosse wythout. The Bishoppe or Suffragane all this while standeth without the Church with a wō
                     derfull great pompe and pride, hauyng holy water hallowed with salt enough standing by him. And taking the holy water,
                        Holy water alwayes one.
                      he goeth three times aboute the Church, casting therof vpon the walles of the Churche as he goeth. Than hauing gone thrise aboute the Churche in this order, hee commeth to the Churchdore, and knocking three times on the

dore with his staffe, saith, these woordes of the Psalme,
                        Oh, blasphemous villanie so to abuse the words of the psalm to such a lewde purpose as thys.
                      Lift vp your gates, &c. as though a whole legion of Diuelles were within the Church. Then commeth me Master clark, and in the name of all the Diuels, he saith, what king is hee that thus dareth knocks at these gates:
                        Mary it is a proud prelate, whom all the diuels in hell cannot resist.
                      And straight way as though the Diuels gaue place, the Clarke openeth the doores, and the bishop entreth wyth a fewe others, who are thought worthye to beholde such mysteries. Being then come into the Churche, first of all hee calleth vppon Saints, and Images, crosseth, and blesseth euery thyng that he seeth or commeth neere. The Churche floore also beeing strowed ouer withe ashes, or els with sande, 
                        ••
                     e first maketh crosses thereon, then letters in Latine, Greeke, and Hebrewe, whereof hee nothing vnderstandeth what they meane, no more then the manne in the Moone.
                        Holy water purifieth & sanctifieth al things
                      Then falleth hee to coniuring of newe holy water (for now the old hath lost his force) wyth wyne, Salte, and Ashes intermixt. This doone, hee proceedeth too hallowe the Altare, and hauing first

made twelue crosses theron,
                        The maner of hallowyng the Altar.
                      he annointeth it with oyle, and chrisme rounde about: after thys hauyng set vpon euery corner of the Altar, a great manye of crosses, he besprynckleth it all ouer with his new made holy water, neuer ceasing but ietting about it 7. times, and as many times sprinkling it with holy water as before. In the middest of the Altar is a foure square hole, hewed out by great art, representyng the Sepulchre, thys hee annoyteth wyth chrysme,
                        He crosseth the altar so often to feare away diuels.
                      and oyle, with a thousande crosses on euery side. In thys Sepulchre, hee layeth his reliques, hys Frankensence, and hys geare.
                  Thus all thynges done in order, and annoynted with Oyle, and Chrisme, besprynkled with holy water, and crossed on euery side,
                        The play is ended.
                      hee endeth his Pageant and departeth. And thus much concernyng the hallowing of Churches, and churchyards.

                  FIrst of all, the Suffragane Bishoppe being come in place, cloathed in his pontificalibus,
                        The maner of gyuyng of popish orders.

                        Because they are bnzzardes, & cannot see.
                      or heard of them before. Then is ther a candle, & a candlestick brought from the high Altar to the Acolouth, with instruction giuen them that their

office is continually to light candles in the Church, and to beare them aboute. This done, than is there an emptie cup brought, and put into their handes with lessons giuen to them, that their office is too giue wyne too the Priest at hys masse, which they doe not, & yet is their crowne shorn for it,
                        These crown

                        •
                     , and deliuereth it to the new Priestes, commaundyng them to learne it by heart:
                        Let thē learne to reade it first good my lord, before they learne it by heart.
                      & by power and veritie thereof to cast out Diuels. Than is the booke carryed againe to the hygh altar
                        •
                     , the Priest neuer reading one worde of it, beeing deliuered him clasped, and yet is he commanded to get it by hearte, and to caste out Diuels with the same. Then is deliuered him the tastament,
                        The testament is giuen him, but to preache truly thereout is forbidden hym.
                      in token that hee ought to preache the same truly too the people: whiche thing neyther hee their great grandsire the Pope, nor any of them all do perfourme.
                  Next after this, there are deliuered vntoo them, the keyes of the Churche

                        Bacchus feaste celebrate by the papistes.
                      spending all that day, & peraduenture 2. or 3. dayes after in daunsing and ryotting in feasting and banketting, in swilling, and drinking like filthie Epicures, tyll they being as drunken as swine,

this satyre, together with the plaies Enterludes, Pageants, office, and ceremonies of this Suffragan bishop.
                  Now whether there bee anythinge heere, either proueable by the woorde of God, or by the example of the primitiue Apostolicall churche, or any particuler member of the same euer since the beginning of the worlde, I referre it too the iudgemente of the wyse and learned.

                     What Courtes hathe the pope vnder him, I pray you for it can not bee that suche a mightie monarchie can stand without any?
                  
               
            
            
               Of the Popes Consistorie Courtes, with the abuses thereof.
               
                  Stuperius.
                  HE hath courtes of diuers and sundrie kindes, the seuerall abuses whereof, if I should particularly intreat of, I should rather want time then matter. And therefore I will speake but only a worde or two concerning his consistorie

court, the warehouse of al his horrible fraud, cosonage & deceite. In this court,
                        The discriptiō of the Popes consistorie court.
                      for money, croked things ar made straight, rough, smoth, truth, falshoode, falshood truth, light darknesse, darknesse light, as pleaseth the master of the fees. Heere golde striketh the stroke, siluer wayes downe the ballance, and friendship, bribes, and giftes carrie the palme of victorie away. Heere such marriages as Gods word knitteth together, are dissolued and broken: and such mariages as Gods worde doth separate are vnited together. In this baudie Courte are such filthie matters handeled,
                        Baudy matters handled in the popes consistory court.
                      as chaste eares would blush once to heare spoken of, continent sober minds would shame once to thinke of, and shamefast lippes would bashe to vtter or speake of. And yet wyll these Romish Doctours (Doctours of bawdrie) laughe at them tyll they chynke agayne.
                        Doctors of baudry.
                      Out of thys Consistorie Courte of Faculties the Quauemyre of all abhomination there bee graunted licences too marrie with whome,
                        What thinges be graunted foorth of this consistorie court of the pope.
                      where, and when thou wylte, for money, although it be thy own sister,

and at any time of the yeere, as well at times prohibited,
                        Fruites of the popes courte.
                      as not prohibited, licences to eate flesh in lent, or any tyme els, licences to stand with thy cap vpon thy head in the Church, at time of highe masse, licences to mary as many wiues as thou wilt, licences to commit whoredome, adulterie, and incest at thy pleasure, to keepe whores, & harlots besides thy wife, licences to cōmit Sodomitrie & buggery, licences to rob, to steale, too murther, to slap, & kill, to sweare, & blaspheme the sacred name of god: licences to haue as many benefices as thou canst get, licences to discontinue frō thy Benefices. And to conclude, there is no deed so haynous, no fact so pernitious, nor any crime so infamous, but for money thou maist haue a licēce in this court safely to commit it, & not only to cōmit it, but also to liue, and continue in it. Finally, in this court mayest thou haue a licence,
                        All thinges in the popes courts to be had for money
                      a tolleration, a quallification, & dispensation for any thing, & when thou hast doone, for money thou shalt haue a fayre absolution graunted thee vnder hand and seale manuel, to be discharged

& set free à culpa & poena,
                     
                        Poena & culpa
                      that is, both from the Faulte or Sinne committed, and also from the punishment or guilte, due for the same. Therefore what needest thou to care what thou doest? For if thou hast money enough,
                        The pope for money wyll thruste thee into heauen whether thou wilt or no.
                      feare not, thou shalt not onely haue absolution, and pardon for all thy sinnes, but also in the end shalte bee chruste intoo heauen whether thou wilt or not. Such force hath money in this court.

                        Note the hypocrisie of these deceyuers.
                      And sometimes they goe in blacke mantles (if it please theyr humours) as thoughe they mourned for some notable matter: But Sub veste lugubri latitat

For money these fellowes wyll ryng it vppe in deede, and in shorte space dyspatch you ye seuen houres, and al. And no maruayle, for from the tyme they begin tyl the time they haue made an end, they neuer cease, but rowle it ouer (like as the waues of the Sea doe vse to tumble one ouer another) as fast as euer they cā galloppe. And whilest they bee at their singing, there is such striuing who shal

                        Hogs striuing one too excell another in grunting.
                      such boing and roaring, that (if thou heardest them) thou wouldst eyther thinke them mad, and ready to go to Bethleem, or els that they stroue for some wager. By meanes of which quyer men,

And oftētimes they seem weary of that too, and therefore strayne they curtesie, and without saying, much good doe it you, they depart before the play be ended. This is all the toyle and trauell which these men (poore soules) do take,

Then in the end, in recompence of theyr great paynes, and long seruice doone, they make them priestes. And after they haue schooled them well, and made them wyse, and fit for their purpose, they sende them abroade into the countries: with bulles, and lycenses, to snatch vppe prebends,

                     Why doe they separate thē
                        selues from other men in that sorte, liuing in the wildernes and desart?
                  
               
               
                  Stupe.
                  They say, they do it, because the world being corrupt, they would not be corrupe with the same:
                        VVhy monkes liue in the wildernesse.
                      and because it liueth in darknesse, and they in the light. Because they are holye, and the worlde wycked, they good, and the worlde naught, and therefore doe they flye from it.
               
               
                  Phile.
                  
                     These are vain allegations, & friuolous reasons: for if the world bee corrupt, (as it is) and sicke, nay dead in sinne, than hath it more need of the phisition to heale the same,
                     
                        Yea but Syr, they may doe what they list.
                      
                     & not to flie away: And if the world be in darknesse, then hath it more need of the light to shine amongst them. And albeit that the worlde bee wicked, may not they lyue godly in the same notwithstanding? Did not Daniel, & many other Iewes in Babilon

liue very godly,
                     
                        The godlye may liue godly amongst the wicked.
                      
                     amongst the wicked? Did not Lot liue godly amongst the Sodomites? Did not Ioseph liue godly in Egypte, and many others? And therfore their separating of thēselues from the worlde for these causes, is most superstitious, vayne, and ridiculous.

                      and deceit: for there are no men, that liue more in the worlde, nor of the worlde, then they. In so muche that there is no greate thinge anye where done, or attempted, but these Monkes bee at the one end of it. In assemblyes for matters of pollicy,

                      the rich friers, and the pore begging friers.

Then are they called by the names of Lordes beyng ashamed of the names of beggers any longer. The poore begging fryers are such, as by theyr orders are constrained to remaine in pouertie & to beg as long as they liue.

                      But from whence they deriue this annoyling, and greasing I cannot tell, except it be from the ceremonies of Moses lawe: which if they doe, then denie they Christ to be come, and to haue fulfilled the lawe for vs. For all ceremonies of Moses lawe ceassed,
                        Their ceremoniall law of Moses abrog

                      and were abrogate by Christe, as beeing but types and shadowes of things to come, and therefore may they not be vsed now vnder the Gospel without great impietie. And albeit that they grease and annoynt themselues at sundrie tunes, yet espeically doe they it, at three seuerall times:
                        Friers annointed at three times especially.
                      namely, the day of their christendom, the day of their consecration, or initiation (as they cal it) & at ye day of their death.
