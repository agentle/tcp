                  IF that you be not paſt all grace,
               O Papyſtes heare mee ſpeake,
               Let reaſon rule, and truth take place,
               Craſe you from that you ſeeke.
               Can you God or his woord deface?
               Can you the truth wythſtand?
               Can you our noble Queene diſplace,
               And yet lyue in England?
            
            
               Take heede beware the Deuyll is a knaue
               He wyl you ſure begile:
               Incruelty he would you haue
               To ſcrue hym here awhile.
               Wyth lying and hipocriſy,
               His kyngdome to mayntayne:
               Contemning truth and equity,
               This is hys ſubtile trayne.
            
            
               Let curſed Cain example be,
               That ſlew Abel his brother:
               Whom neither God with Maieſty,
               Could moue to leaue his murder
               Nor yet the godly lyfe of hym,
               That gaue hym none offence,
               Tyll he had heaped vp hys ſynne,
               In practeſyng his pretence.
            
            
               Let Core and Dathan come frō hell
               Where now they do remayne,
               That they their minds at lēgth maitel
               Wherfore they ther remain.
               Namely, for that they did rebel,
               And would not be perſwaded,
               But would be Lordes in Iſrael,
               Tyll hel had them deuoured.
            
            
               What could make Abſalon meeke & tame
               And to deſiſt from rage?
               His father Dauids worthy fame,
               Or yet his counſel ſage?
               No, no, theſe things wil not preuail
               With hym that feares not God,
               The force of doctrine ther doth fail,
               Tyl God ſtrike with his rod.
            
            
               And as the Deuil in theſe did rage,
               To worke his wycked wyll,
               That nothyng coulde theyr furye ſwage
               Tyl they did it fuifyl.
               So that the law of God and Man,
               They ſought to ouerthrow,
               Euen ſo of late I truly can
               The lyke vnto you ſhow.
            
            
               When Kyng Edward of worthy fame
               Had Antichriſt put downe,
               And to the glory of Gods name,
               Had placed truth in her roome:
               The denſhire dolts like Rebels ranck,
               In ruſty armour ranged,
               But hangd wer ſom, their cariōs ſtāck,
               The world was quickly changed.
            
            
               And then dyd Ket the tanner ſtout
               In Norffolke play his part,
               Aſſemblyng ſuch his Rebels rout,
               That Innocents might ſmart.
               But hanged he was, this was his end,
               And ſo ende all the ſort,
               That Rebels are, and wyll not mend,
               A rope be their comfort.
            
            
               Such bleſſings as the Nortons had,
               And ſuch as Felton found,
               God ſend them all that are ſo bad
               Wyth heeles to bleſſe the ground.
               If that you lyke not for to haue,
               This bleſſyng in a rope,
               Leaue of you Rebels for to raue
               And curſſe your Dad the Pope.
            
            
               Which makes you oft ſuch Crowes to pul
               Then leaues you in the mire,
               In ſending you to ſuch a Bull,
               This is but ſymple hire.
               Behold the end of thys attempt
               That laſt here was begun,
               Loe God your doyng doth preuent,
               The Rebels race to run.
            
            
               Synce God by grace doth guyde hys flock
               That none can them anoy,
               If you be grafted in this ſtocke,
               He wyl you not deſtroy.
               Feare God, flee ſyn, the truth embrace,
               And ſeeke your Prince to pleaſe,
               Obey the lawes and call for grace,
               So ſhall you lyue at peace.
            
            God ſaue our Queene Elizabeth.
