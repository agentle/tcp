               NOw my painfull eyes are rowling,
               And my passing Bell is towling:
               Towling sweetly: I lye dying,
               And my life is from me flying.
            
            
               Grant me strength, O gracious God,
               For to endure thy heauy rod:
               Then shall I reioyce and sing,
               With Psalmes vnto my heauenly King.
            
            
               
                  Simeon that blessed man,
               Beleeued Christ when he was come,
               And then he did desirs to dye,
               To liue with him eternally.
            
            
               Christ wrought me a strong saluation,
               By his death and bitter passion:
               He hath washt and made me cleane,
               That I should neuer sinne againe.
            
            
               Grieuous paines doe call and cry,
               O man, prepare thy selfe to dye.
               All my sinnes I haue lamented,
               And to dye I am contented.
            
            
               Silly Soule, the Lord receiue thée,
               Death is come, and life must leaue thée,
               Death doth tarry no mans leasure,
               Then farewell all earthly pleasure.
            
            
               In this world I nothing craue,
               But to bring me to my Graue,
               In my Graue while I lye sleeping▪
               
               Angels haue my soule in keeping.
            
            
               When the Bells are for me ringing,
               Lord receiue my soule with singing:
               Then shall I be frée from paine,
               To liue and neuer dye againe.
            
            
               Whiles those wormes corruption bréed on,
               Wayte my noysome corpes to féed on,
               My feruent loue (this prison loathing)
               Craues a robe of Angels cloathing.
            
            
               Farewell world and worldly glory,
               Farewell all things transitory,
               
                  Sion hill my soule ascendeth,
               And Gods Royall Throne attendeth.
            
            
               Farewell wife and children small,
               For I must goe now Christ doth call,
               And for my death be ye content,
               When I am gone, doe not lament.
            
            
               Now the Bell doth cease to towle,
               Sweet Iesus Christ receiue my soule▪

                  O God which did the world create,
               Heare a poore sinner at thy gate:
               Thou that from death didst set me free,
               Remit my sinns and shew mercy.
            
            
               Oh thou that caus'dst thy blessed Sonne,
               Into this Uniuerse to come,
               Thy Gospell true here to fulfill,
               And to subdue death, sinne, and hell.
            
            
               Grant for his sake that dy'd on trée,
               On the blest Mount of Caluary:
               That I being grieued for my sin,
               May by repentance heauen win.
            
            
               The Gospell saith, Who so beléeue,
               To them wilt thou a blessing giue:
               Amongst which number grant me faith,
               That to beleeue, thy Gospell saith.
            
            
               Which if I doe, (as grant I may,
               Though here I dye, I liue for aye:
               Then Sauiour swéet, remit my sin,
               And giue me grace that life to win.
            
            
               And since they death (a price most great)
               Hath bought me, here I doe intreat,
               To giue me grace thy Name to praise,
               Both now, and euermore alwaies.
            
            
               For by thy death my soule is frée
               From hell, which still by thy decrée,
               To sinners all for sinn
                     ••
                   due,

               My sinnes, O Lord, I doe confesse,
               Like sands in Sea are numberlesse.
            
            
               Yet though my sinnes as scarlet show,
               Their whitenesse may exceede the Snow▪
               
               If thou thy mercy doest extend,
               That I my sinfull life may mend.
            
            
               Which mercy thy blest Word doth say,
               At any time obtaine I may,
               If power and grace in me remaine,
               From carnall sin for to refraine.
            
            
               Then giue me grace, Lord, to refraine
               From sinnes, that I may still remain

               My soule with thee immediately,
               May haue abode amongst the blest,
               And liue for euer in true rest.
