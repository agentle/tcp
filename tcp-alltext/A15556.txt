                  This Sermon was found hidden in a wall.
                In these our later dayes moost necessarye to be knowen. Neyther addynge to nor diminishynge fro. Saue the olde and rude englishe therof mended here & there.

            LO Christen reder, whyle the worlde not slū
               bred, but routed. and snorted in the depe and dead slepe of ygnorauncye, some lyuelye spirites were wakynge, and ceased not to calle vppon the drousye mul

               itude of men, and to styrre them vp frō the longe dreames of synfull lyuynge, that ones at the last they wold crepe out of darkenesse, & come forth to the hote shynyng sūne of goddes worde, that both the fylthie mystes of theyr hartes myghte be driuen awaye, and also theyr heuye and dy
                  •
               nge spirites recreated, refresshed,

and quyckened. So that no man can alledge that in anye age there wanted preachers of goddes worde. For he that kepeth Israell slepeth not, ne slō
               breth. And thoughe thorow his secrete counsayle, he sendethe more labourers into his harueste at one tyme then at another, yet he hathe euer some to wede, to reape to gether sheues togither in to the barnes of euerlastyng lyfe. Read therfore diligently this lytle sermon so longe sithens written, and thou shalte perceyue the same quicke spirite in the authoure therof, that thou nowe merueilest at in other of oure tyme.
            He sharply, ernestlye. and wyttely rebuketh the synnes of all sortes of men, and speaketh as one hauynge auctorytye, and as the scrybes, and pharisees, whiche with theyr leaded, and

blunt dartes could neuer touch the quycke, thoughe they haue occupied, and worne the pulpettes so many yeares. The worde of God is lyuelye, and mighty in operation, and sharper then any two edged swerde and cuteeth euen vnto the dyuision of the soule, and of the spirite, and of the ioyntures, and mary. &c. wherfore ef

            CHriste the authour and doctoure of all truth. in hys gospel,math. 2 lykeneth the kyngedome of heauen, to a housholder, sayeng on this wyse. Lyke is the kyngedome of heauen to a houssholdynge man, that wente forth fyrste in the mornynge, to hyre workemen into hys vyneyarde, so dyd he about the thyrde houre the syxte / the nynthe, and the eleuēth. And as he founde men standyng ydle, he sayed to them why stand ye here vnoccupied, Go ye into my vyneyarde and that, that is dewetye, I shall gyue you. And when the daye was ended, he called hys stewarde,

and bad that he shulde gyue euery man a pennye.
            Spiritually, this householder is our maister and lord Christ the true housholder and heade of hys churche here in earthe: whiche calleth men in diuers houres of the daye, that is in dyuers ages of the worlde. As in the tyme of nature, he called by insperation, Abell. Enoche, Noe, Abrahā, and other lyke.
            In the time of the olde law. he called Moses, Dauyd, Esaye, and Ieremy, with the prophetes. And in the tyme of grace he called the apostles, martyrs confessours, and virgins. He called also some in chyldehode as Iohan Baptiste. Some in their youth as Iohan the Euangelyste, some in myddle age as Peter and Andrewe. Some in their later dayes. As Gamaliel, and Ioseph of Brimathye.

And all those be called to laboure in the Lordes vyneyard that is hys churche. yea and that sundrye wayes. For ryght as ye se, that in trymmynge of thys materyall vyne, there be dyuers labourers. For some cutte away the braunches that be voyde. Some vnderset, and laye abrode the vyne: yea, some pare away the olde earth, and laye newe to the roote, whiche offyces, all be so necessarye to the vyne. that yf anye of them fayle, or want, it shal be eyther let, or vtterly destroy the grow ynge of the vyne: For onlesse the vyne be cutte, she wyl waxe wylde excepte she berayled vp and layed abrode, wedes and nettels wyll soone ouer growe her. And yf the rote be not fatted wyth new and fresh donge for feablenesse, she shall waxe

               rs, Preesthode, Knyghthod, & labourers. To preestes or preachers, it behoueth to cutte awaye the voyde braunches of synne, with the sword of goddes worde. To knyghtes it falleth to let wronges, & the hastes to be done, and to mayntayne Goddes lawe, and them that be teachers thereof. yea and to kepe the lande from insurrection, and inuadynge of, other lādes, The labourers muste labour bodyly, and with sore sweate, get out of the erth bodylye sustenaunce bothe for them selfe and for other, And all these estates be so nedefull to the churche, that none maye well be without other. For yf Preestes wanted, the people for defaulte of knowledge of

Gods worde, wold waxe wild in vyces, and so dye goostlye.

               e he shulde dye, or hys lyfe shulde be worse then yf he were not. And the cause is thus, for that thynge that kynde hath ordeyned for mans sustenaūce without other preparynge, or alterynge then it hath of kynde accordeth not to him. As yf a mā haue corne as it commeth from the earth yet it is no meate accordynge to him vntyll it be by mās craft chaūged into breade And though he haue flesshe or fysshe, yet whyle it is raw, and not by mans laboure sodden, rosted broyled, or baken it accordeth not to mannes sustenaūce.

            As surelye this one thynge shulde be a greate cause, why euery estate shulde loue other. And men of one crafte shulde neither hate, neither despyse men of an other crafte. For one of them is so nedefull to another, that oftentimes, those craftes that seme moost vnhoneste, myghte worste be forborne. And thus I dare saye, that he that is not labourynge in this world, either in praieng and preachynge, as behoueth preestes. for the health of the people, or in defendynge the

causes of the nedy, in sighting agaynst tyrrauntes, & enemyes which is the office of knyghtes or in laborynge on the earthe, that perteineth to the cōmons. when the daye of rekenynge shall come, that is the ende of this lyfe, right as he lyued here without laboure or trauayle, so shall he wante there the rewarde of the penny, that is the endelesse ioye of heauen. And as he was lyuynge here, after no state, nor order, so shall he thē be put into the place, wher is no order, but euerlastynge horroure and sorowe, that is hell. wherfore euery man se to what estate.Iob, 10.

This is wrytten, that god suffred thys temptaciō to come to hym, for an ensample of paciens to all

And so was also the temptatiō of holy Iob and thoughe Thoby frome his chyldehode euermore dyd dread God, and kepe his cōmaundementes, yet was he not agreaued agaynste god, though that the myscheuous blyndnes fell to him, but vnmeueably dwelled in the drede of god, thankīg hym all the dayes of his lyfe.
