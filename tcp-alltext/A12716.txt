                  To the most reuerend Father in God, George Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate and Metrapolitan of all England, and one of his Maiesties most honourable priuy Councell.
                  
                  
                     THe manifold fauors that your GRACE hath extended to me, euen from before I was knowne vnto you by face, and euer since hath continued them abundantly

without any my deserts: hath imboldened me (most reuerend Father in God) to Dedicate vnto your GRACE, and gracious protection, these my last labours in this cloud of witnesses of Gods truth. An argument it is vnto some, of some seeming difficultie, and a rough path vnto many vnusuall trode in, and therefore requireth a far more able meanes to smooth the way then either my wit, or weake ability can any waies aford. That the Scriptures Genealogies are vaine: some that follow their owne vaine in preferring zeale before knowledge, would haue the Apostle to pronounce. Others (besides their authority, for that they are penned by Gods Spirit) account them vselesse and empty, either to bee

knowne or taught. To meete with both, my selfe of many thousands the least, haue assaid, first, in drawing the lineall descents of all the Tribes, and of euery family from first to last, to illustrate the text: and especially theirs of Iudahs, that lead vnto Christ. And now in this small treatise doe endeauour to shew their vses, both in the holy stories, to whom they are staies, and in confirmation of Gods promises, to whom they are a great cloud of witnesses. But for my refuge against the oposers of this my so weak a performance, to whom shall I flie, but onely to your Grace, whom God and his Maiesty hath appointed to the helme of Christs ship in these Brittish seas. And who formerly was one of those reuerend

Commissioners that approued and authorised the publication of my draughts of the Scriptures Genealogies vnto the world. That I am not a Leuite I confesse, and farre vnworthy to offer, or to come neer vnto the Altar, I acknowledge; yet am I not thereby quite exempted from seruice, but am inioyned (as all others are) to labour, and to lay hand to the forwarding of Gods worke. For not onely the Leuites ministred to the prouision of the first Tabernacle, but euery one of them also (that were numbred from twenty yeers old and aboue, among sixe hundred thousand, three thousand fiue hundred & fiftie men) did offer his halfe shekell for the setting forward of the Sanctuary. And for the increase

of Gods treasurie, the poore widdow did minister as well as the rich Pharisee. The seruant that had but one Talent in charge, for hiding that one was condemned, & the frutlesse fig-tree withered in one night. The very heathen man could say; That man is not borne onely for himselfe, & we know that all must labour in the Lords vine-yard, and not stand idle all the day. And sure I am that your GRACE, as another Moses, wisheth that all the people in the Host could prophesie with Eldad & Medad: & as Gods high Priest, continually shaketh the Censer of sweet prayers, for the wealth of his Zion, & peace of our Church: in whose hand I pray that Aarons rod may long bud, & that from your forehead

may long shine Holinesse to the Lord. That God therefore who hath indued your GRACE with many blessed graces in this mortall life, continue them long to his glory, your own comfort, and our consolation: and after your Pilgrimage in this vale of teares, crowne you in the life of immortality, to reigne with his Christ, and as a starre to shine among his elect and chosen children for euer.
                  
                     Your Graces in all most humble and dutifull seruises to bee commanded,
IOHN SPEED.

                        THe holy ascents mounting into those sacred buildings, which are laid vpon the foundations of the Prophets and Apostles, (Christ Iesus himselfe being the Corner stone) are the Times, the Persons, and the Places of the Scriptures Records, which are as strong stayes, to mount into the historicall sight of the sacred Scriptures, as were the steps (though supported with twelue Lions) that led into Salomons Throne. Any of which either so laid or mistaken, hindreth the eye of some perfect obiest, that otherwise from them lye open to the sight: so no man can deny, but that in all humane descriptions, these are the Sinewes of the narration; and in the sacred Text, these also are the Cement that couer together the well squared Stones in the Lords building, without noise or stroke, either of Axe or Hammer: And doe still make knowne, how sure by Text, the holy Spirit vttereth a vniforme truth. For the euent of Prophecies, falling in any Age, vpon any Person, People, or Place, and meeting in the Center of a perfect performance; declares the constant accomplishment of Gods determined decrees,
                     
                     whether it be in his Iustice vpon the sons of reiection and death, or in his mercy vpon the children of Election and life, and are to the mind of the thirsting searcher, as the watersprings were to Dauids heart: and more to be desired then the gold refined in the fier seauen times. The discents of the persons, the Genealogies annexed to the new translated Bible doe shew; and what part they beare for illustration of Scriptures, this present Treatise in some part doth witnesse; which, had it beene written with a more learned pen, would haue giuen (I know) farre more satisfaction, especially to such as thinke their doctrine condemned by the Apostle; or atleast, of lesse vse then other studies of Scripture. Upon which occasion, and the desire of others more moderatly minded, these paines were vndertaken and gone: wherein I haue rather chosen to confirme their vses in a continual discourse, then to rippe vp the assertions of an ignorant zeale: lest in opening the obiection, the opinion proposed proue little lesse then blasphemy: as Solon in his lawes forbare to mention the punishment for the murtherers of Parents, lest in naming the Fact, the thoughts of the children might be corrupted. And albeit I haue not curiously carued, but rather rough hewen the stones to this worke (as the least labourer, and in the last houre of the day) yet the foundation being laid vpon the sacred sure Text, cannot bee tempestshaken, howsoeuer for manner and stile, it may bee found faultie, in the searching eyes of this learned age. And the thing especially aimed, How God became Man, and how the Immanuel Iesus was the Messiah of the world, and King of the Iewes, beside the ho

                     Some Chapters in this second Edition are added vnto the first, and the Chapters of the first somewhat inlarged with matters of like kind. The purpose of all is, to shew that God in Christ, 
                     Col. 1. 20 reconciled the world to himselfe. And that Christ is Gen. 3. the seed in whom the world shall be saued. In former ages reuealed

                        That the holy Genealogies of the sacred Scriptures are of great vse, and being penned by Gods holy Spirit, ought of all to be knowne.
                     
                     
                        THat this subiect of the Scriptures sacred Genealogies may appeare to bee both holy and vsefull: before we enter into the particulars, let vs view the frame of the whole; how that frō the Genes. 3. 15. seed of the woman in Paradice, where the first promise was made of our saluation, they leade vs to the Sonne of a Mat. 2. 1. Virgine in Bethlehem, where the first appearance

                        n our

flesh was of him that wrought our saluation.
                     Betwixt which persons and times God himselfe was the Recorder, and with that Ex. 31. 18 finger that first writ the Law, led the hand of Moses to name from Genes. 5. father to sonne, the persons produced: euen from Adam, that fell from a pleasurable Garden of rest, vnto Ioshuah, that led and set the people in a pleasurable Ios. 13. 1. land of rest; being thirtie generations in a direct line, besides their collaterals.
                     In all which, the promises of God appeared, that was made to man in his Christ: In Ge. 5. 29. 
                        Noah, the comfort that the world in him should enioy. In Ge. 17. 4. Gen. 12. 3. 
                        Abraham, the Promise, that the world in him should be blessed. And in 2. Sam. 7. 13. 
                        Dauid, the sonne, and King, that should raigne euerlastingly.
                     All which things the Genealogies doe testifie, and we know that their testimonie is true: and how carefully their pedegrees haue been kept, wee see still recorded by the holy Ghosts writ.
                     In Moses, all of them euen vnto

himselfe; and where Moses left, the Writer of Rut. 4. 20 
                        Ruth doth continue thē vnto Dauid. And Dauids sonnes likewise, both Kings and collaterals, are most exactly registred, and for the most part, with their matches, and mothers, out of seuerall Tribes named, whilest that stem of kings bare any branches.
                     And the care of preseruing the holy Genealogies, the holy Ghosts pen hath well shewed in the first 1. Cor. 1. &c. booke of the Chronicles, where the first nine Chapters doth affoord in a manner no other matter, besides the rehearsall of the generations from Adam to those times. As the like is done for the present, by the books of the Chronicles, of Kings and the Prophets, vntill the Captiuitie of Babylon cut off their Kings, and the glory of Iudah became thereby eclipsed.
                     Notwithstanding, in the times of the later Prophets, the like prouidence is continued, by preseruing the Lights of the holy Genealogies a

                        Alexander; where ended the Storie of the old Testament.
                     And in the New, the holy Genealogies are set euen in the frontispice thereof, and the first text read in the Gospel is, Mat. 1. 1 
                        The Booke of the generation of Iesus Christ, the Sonne of Dauid, the Sonne of Abraham.
                     
                     Which well considered, if nothing else could moue a reuerend desire to studie them, yet at leastwise should it moue a trembling feare to despise them; seeing that Christ is the subiect of that diuine text, the Apo. 1. 8. 
                        Alpha & Omega, through Rom. 11. 36. whom they were writ; and the Mat. 21. 24. 
                        Stone that bruseth his contemners to powder.
                     
                        Genealogies then, being the first step laid in the new Testament, are for vse the first step that mounteth from earth vnto heauen, as Gen. 28. 12. 
                        Iacobs Ladder did reach, by which the great Archangell Christ from the top descended, vnto the lowest staffe, the Tabernacle of our flesh.
                     
                        
In them wee see the dispercions of Families in the peopleing of the World, and in them the gouernment of the World when it was peopled. In them the state of the holy and sincere worshippers of God; and in them the wicked Idolaters and profaners of all his waies. Briefly, in them we see both the builders and pullers downe of the walles of Sion; Gods mercy euer extended vpon his chosen, the blessed; and his wrath euer seuere vpon the reiected, the cursed.

                     If then from the wise, wisdome is to be had, what truer can be gotten, then from the ancient Patriarkes, Fathers, and high Saints, both before and

                     Vnto Enos was borne Cainan the Contrite; and vnto him Mahalaleel the praise-God; whose sonne was Iared the lowly, and his sonne Enoch

His sonne was Methuselah the spearedeath; and his, Lamech the heartwounded: who fore-seeing the generall deluge, named his sonne Noah the Comforter, that should restore the earth which God had cursed, and re-people the world, which for sinne was drowned.
                     And the like appellations had the Fathers after the Floud, when the yeeres of their liues were cut shorter by the halfe: for Sem the second son of Noah, was named Renowne, who in his name Melchizedek is renowned

indeed, being the first King and 
                           Melchisedech the first King and Priest in the world. Priest mentioned in the world, and the figure of Christ in them both. His sonne Arphaxad was a Healer, and his sonne Sale, a spoiler; his sonne Heber, a Pilgrim, and his sonne Peleg a Diuision, and so consequently of all the rest.

                     Then let vs not thinke, that these names of Christ his Parents (or others vpon occasions giuen or changed) fell from the mouthes of these Patriarkes, as lots fall from the lappe; but rather doe those Prophets fore-seeing Christ to come, All the Fathers by faith saw Christ. met him with their thankfull remembrances, and saw his daies a farre off, and reioyced.
                     These Etymologies then leade vs vnto the Messiah, as the Starre did the Wise-men vnto Christ; wherein if our dull apprehensions fall too short (as who can comprehend the full

mystery that God would become man in the flesh) where we vnderstand, let vs reioyce and bee thankfull; and where wee vnderstand not, let vs pray for his Spirit, that 2 Cor. 4. 6. our darknes may be made light in Christ.

                     For in the sweete promises to Abraham, that Gen. 15. 13. 
                        his seed should inherit the Land of Canaan, this pill of bitter digestion came in; that they Gen. 15. 13. 
                        should be afflicted in a strange Land, the space of foure hundred yeeres, and those expired, in the fourth generation they should be deliuered. Now the most noted affliction, was the thraldome of Egypt, vnder the burdens of brick and clay; and the deliuery from that The promise for deliuerāce accomplished in the fourth generation. 
                        Iron furnace, was as faithfully accomplished, and as mightily performed in the fourth generation of Israels sons.

                     For Abraham at Gen. 12. 4. seuenty fiue receiued the promise, and at an hundred of his life (which was twenty fiue yeeres after) Isaac

impossibility, that from seuenty persons onely, sixe hundred thousand men, besides women and children, should bee proceated within the compasse of two hundred and fifteene yeeres.
                     For if we consider the wonderful increase of Israel in Egypt, who aboundantly multiplied, and waxed exceeding many, so that the Land (saith the Text) was filled with them: and that from seauenty persons, all of them able, and apt for generation, we shal find it nothing so strange.
                     But stranger had it beene, if Israels abode had beene in Egypt, fully foure hundred and thirty yeeres, with no greater increase, God promising to multiply that seede of Abraham as the starres of Heauen, and the dust of the earth. 
                        Gen. 22. 17.
                     
                     For in the like space of foure hundred and thirty yeeres, the World from the floud was replenished onely by three persons, Iaphet, Sem, and Ham, with farre greater increase. For in Abrahams story we reade, of the preparation of nine Kings, and Gen. 14.
                        
of sixe Nations in Canaan, and the Countries adiacent.
                     And that the earth was peopled and replenished both continent, and Ilands long before, wee see, by the dispersions of Noahs sonnes through the world; neither doth the Text being aduisedly read, inforce any such continuance in Egypt: for thus doth Moses write, and our last translation reade: The soiourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was foure hundred 
                        Exod. 12. 40. 
                        and thirty yeeres.
                     
                     But that the Israelites dwelt not The Israelites dwelt not in Egypt 430 yeeres. in Egypt foure hundred and thirty yeeres, as Genebrard vnderstandeth Moses, a second foundation by the holy Genealogies is laid: for Gen. 46. 11. 
                        Kohath accompanied Iacob into Egypt, and his sonne was Exod. 6. 18. 20. 
                        Amram, and his son Moses.
                     
                     Then seeing Kohath is the enterer, and Moses the departer, the time cannot extend to foure hundred and thirty yeeres: for Kohath liued but one hundred thirty three yeeres: Exod. 6. 20. 
                        Amram his sonne, but one hundred thirty seuen; and Moses his son was

eighty at the departure. All which added together, make but three hundred and fifty, and yet some of them also must bee deducted where they liued together. These ages therfore are so sure and true witnesses of Moses his meaning, that Genebrard mistaking it, affirmeth some betwixt Kohath and Moses to bee omitted. To such extremity Genealogies enforceth.
                     And yet further to illustrate the text for story, a weake woman may 
                           Iochebed the daughter of Leui, and mother of Moses.
                         serue to support the truth: namely, Iochebed the mother of Moses, who was the immediate daughter of Leui, borne vnto him in Egypt, by Elishebah his wife: Nom. 26. 59. Now the life of Leui extended but to one hundred thirty seuen yeeres; Exod. 6. 16. whereof forty three were spent before hee came into Egypt, which thus may be collected.
                     
                        Leui was borne of Leah, in the third yeere of the second seuen, of 
                           Leui his age gathered by Iosephs.
                         
                        Iacobs seruice with Laban; in the end of which seauen, Ioseph also was borne: Gen. 30. 25. & Chap. 31. 41.

So that Ioseph is but foure yeeres yonger then Leui. Now Iosephs age at his expounding of Pharoahs dreame, was thirty: Gen. 41. 46. And thence the seauen yeeres of plenty, and the two of famine were expired; Gen. 45. 6. So that Ioseph was aged when his Father and bretheren came into Egypt, thirty nine yeeres, and Leui his elder, was at that 
                           Leui his age when he came into Egypt.
                         time forty three: whose continuance then in Egypt must be ninety foure yeeres; for ninety foure added to forty three, make one hundred thirty seauen, his whole age to his death: before which time it is manifest Iochebed (his daughter) must bee borne, or be begotten.
                     Now if the abode in Egypt were fully foure hundred & thirty yeeres, then three hundred thirty six yeeres after Leui his death, must be the departure thence; but so long a time by Iochebeds age cannot be granted: for she being borne but ninety foure yeeres after the first entrance, and liuing to beare a sonne, but eighty yeers before the departure; the time

betwixt the death of her father, and the birth of her sonne, must be the age of her owne life: for had shee beene borne the day of her fathers 
                           Iochebeds age disanulleth the 430 yeeres abode in Egypt.
                         death, which is not likely, and had died the day of her sonnes birth, which wee know is contrary, yet must shee haue beene two hundred fifty and sixe yeeres old when shee bare Moses. A time by much too long for weomen to conceiue, and her age farre vnfit to giue sucke, or to bee chosen a fit nurse for a Kings daughters sonne.
                     And therefore it is certenly gathered by these holy Genealogies, that The Peregrinations of the Patriarks, and the abode in Egypt together, make 430 yeeres. the peregrinations of the Patriarks, Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, for the space of two hundred and fifteene yeeres, must be accounted with the time of the continuance in Egypt, both which together make the sum of foure hundred and thirty.
                     What lights therefore Genealogies are for history, let these here alleaged stand for witnesses, wherein I appeale to the gaine-sayers themselues, whether any text bee forced

contrary to the true meaning.

                        he Prophet Ieremy affirmeth to haue

beene seuenty yeeres, and doth begin their account in Ier. 25. 1. 11. the first yeere of Nebuchadnezzar King of Babel, from whence Ier. 27. 7. 
                        all nations should serue him, his sonne, and sonnes sonne, the space of seuenty yeeres: which expired in the third of Belshazzar, and first yeere of King Cyrus, when the raigne of the Kingdome of Persia beganne, as it is in 2. Chron. 36. 20. 22.
                     Vpon which Text of Ieremie, Daniel tooke his occasion of Prayer for 
                           Daniel his prayer vpon occasion of Ieremies prophecie. their deliuerance, and the Lord was as ready to accomplish his promise, who sending his Angell euen in the same moment, certified him, that whilest his supplications were in making, 
                        Dan. 9. 24. 
                        the Decree of deliuerance was in determining; and that not onely from Babels seuenty yeeres captiuity: but also thence after seuenty times seuen should bee a full deliuerance from spiritual thraldome, by the doctrine and death of the Messiah.
                     
                     These seuenty seuens Gabriel diuideth 
                           Daniels seuens diuided into three parts. into 3. parts, as followeth. 1. To the rebuilding of the City, and building the second Temple, seuen seuens. Secondly,

                        Sixty two seuens, wherein a silence for Prophesie, the want of fier from heauen, & the Vrim and Thummim should be had. And thirdly, one seuen, in the halfe whereof Christ should confirme the Couenant for many, and in the end thereof, should seale vp mans redemption by his death and passion.
                     Notwithstanding, this tripple account, and plainnesse of Chronologie (which the Angell aimeth at, as to the true period of times fulnesse) hath beene troubled with the vncertaine computations both of Iewes and Christians, who haue both shrunke and tentered them from the iust number of foure hundred and 
                           Daniels seuens miscast ninety yeeres; which seuenty seuens make in their owne propriety.
                     For some will haue them to containe no fixed certaine time at all, D. R. in M. S. but rather thinke they were spoken vnto Daniel; as Christ spake vnto Peter in forgiuing his brothers offences; Mat. 18. 22. 
                        I say not vnto thee vnto seauen times, but vnto seuenty times seuen times: or as his, that doth begin them fifty

yeeres before Babels fall, and ends them towards the dissolution of the world, Hierom vpō Dan. 9. as Hierome citeth Hypolitus to haue done: or if any certainty be in them, yet such it is, as may rather dazell the eye vnto dimmer darkenesse, then illuminate the vnderstanding 
                           Daniels seuens mistaken. with brighter knowledge, if we will lend our eares vnto Origen; who vnderstandeth these weekes, not to be weekes of seauen yeeres, but of ten times seauen, Origen hom. 29. vpon Mat: for euery yeere taking ten, and doth beginne their reckoning from the beginning of the world; so that seuenty weeks should make foure thousand nine hundred yeeres from the creation vnto Christ: and some beginne them at the natiuity of Christ, and continueth them vnto the end of the World, as Apollianus hath done.
                     Others that allow their certainty and propriety of the Angels speech, yet doe differ in assigning their beginnings and endings; because three other edicts are mentioned in Ezra and Nehemiah, besides that of Cyrus: 
                        Ezra 6. 1. Ezra 7. 12. Nehem. 2. and yet wheresoeuer they beginne

them, they still bring their endings,

                           Daniels seuens began in the first yeere of Cyrus.

accounts, were not the holy The Genealogies giue passage to Daniels propriety. Genealogies the bridge, it were vnpossible for vs to passe.
                     For in their first number, from the first yeere of Cyrus vnto the finishing of the Temple, in the Ezra 6. 15 sixth of Darius, are added vnto the proprietie of those Seuen Seuens, fiftie seuen yeeres, making of forty nine, (which they properly import) no lesse then 
                           Iunius in his annotation vpon that text of Haggai in his last edition. an hundred and sixe yeeres. And in the like manner the time from that worke, vnto the end of the Persians raigne, is likewise ouerstretched to bee aboue fourescore yeeres, more then the Sunne euer measured.
                     The maine cause of whose differences, are the variable accounts of the Heathen, and the vncertaine computations of the vncertaine Olympiads. And therefore to direct these times, the holy Genealogies are as the Reede in the Angels hand, that measured the Apoc. 11. 1. Temple and Altar of the holy City, and the men then liuing, a cloud of witnesses to cōfirme the Times certenty vnto vs.
                     
                        
For, seeing that the sacred Scriptures (for story) at the rebuilding of Ierusalem and second Temple did cease: the disagreements of profane No account to be made of profane Writers for Daniels Seuens.
                         Writers, in Times computation so manifestly apparant, and the euer erring Olympiads (the onely Chronicle of the Heathen) so vncertaine of beginning, and neglect for continuance, no sure foundation can be laid vpon so sandy or soft a ground.
                     Nor may those profane authorities bee held fit pillars to support The cause too waighty for the he athen to witnesse the waight, of the waightiest speech of times measure, and promise of mans Redemption, reuealed in the old testament of God: but are to be reiected in this holy computation, as the vnmeasured Court was to be cast out and giuen to the Gentiles. 
                        Apo. 11. 12 And yet wee deny not, but where the Gentiles agree with Gabriels account, The Heathen Writers may serue as handmaids to the Scriptures text. they may be brought as witnesses to the truth, and God by them iustified in his promises, when he is iudged. Therefore to approue the proprietie of Daniels Seuens, let vs trauerse them by the Scriptures allowance,

both in the ages and liues of men.
                     That the first diuision of Gabriels Seuens (which was from the going forth of the Edict, to the Dan. 9. 25. rebuilding of Ierusalem) fell accordingly, and were forty nine yeeres to the finishing of the worke, the answer of the Iewes to our Sauiour Christ, doth so A certenty in the first diuision of Daniels Seuens.
                         much import, when demanding by what authoritie he droue the market out of the Temple, and what signes hee shewed to testifie his authoritie, Destroy (said he) Ioh. 2. 18 
                        this Temple, and in three dayes I will raise it vp: speaking of the Temple of his body. But they ignorant of his meaning, replied thus: Forty sixe yeeres this Temple was in building, and wilt thou reare it vp in three dayes.
                     
                     And whereas Bullinger. & Scaliger. some are of opinion that the Iewes vnpremeditated made this answere, as they did of Christs age, Thou art not yet fifty, and hast thou seene Abraham: yet seeing the account falleth according to the assignement, we may wel think they spake vpon an Historicall

knowledge: for three yeeres added thereunto, which were the yeeres from Cyrus his Edict, vnto the hindrance of that Ezra 4. 24. worke by his successors, and for which Daniel mourned three weekes of dayes, Chapter 10. 2. make the number to be fortie nine, euen seuen times seuen yeeres; vnto which certenty some are so confident, that they auouch these forty sixe yeeres did forefigure Christ his age vpon the earth, and doe draw the yeeres of his life, vnto the like number of Alleaged by D. Willet vpon Dan. 9. fol. 304. forty sixe, because as they imagine, the body should answer the shadow, the substance the figure, and the true Temple the materiall in euery degree; albeit herein they are much deceiued: for that the dayes of Christ vpon earth, came not fully to thirty three yeeres, as by the yeeres of his birth and death vnder the raignes of the Romane Emperours Augustus and Tiberius is seene.
                     But that fifty seuen more should be added, and the yeeres tentured vnto an hundred and sixe, betwixt

the first of King Cyrus, and the building of the Temple, the ages of diuers men in those daies will not permit; and therefore by the holy Scriptures let vs see how the holy Genealogies stay them from rouing too farre.
                     First it is manifest that Zerubabel 
                        
                           Zerubbabel of yeers sufficient to gouerne the returned. of Iudah, was a Prince of yeeres and actiuenesse, fit to leade and command the people in their returne from captiuitie, in the first yeere of Cyrus: and so hee is euer named in the catalogue amongst the returned, and that in the 
                        Ezra 3. 8 
                        second yeere and second moneth after their comming to Ierusalem, he began to set forward the worke of the house of the Lord, 
                        Zerubbabel laid the Temples foundation.
                         
                        and to lay the foundation of the Temple, is by Ezra recorded, and as manifestly was it promised, that hee should see that his worke finished, for said Zechariah from the Lord, Zech. 3. 9 
                        Zerubbabel laid the foundation of this house, and his hands shall finish it. What age Zerubbabel was of when he vnderwent that Gouernment, wee know not, but must coniecture, he

was of yeeres fit for that charge: but to liue from that age, to an hundred and sixe yeeres more, is more then without warrant can bee credited, and yet for any thing knowne The Scriptures must warrant, where we must credit. to the contrary, he might liue long after the worke was finished.
                     Another witnesse wee haue as aged (if not more) as Zerubbabel, and a principall man also, who with him Nehem. 12. 1. returned from Babylon in the first yeere of Cyrus, euen Ezra the Scribe, the sonne of Seraiah the high Priest, whose ancestors both in the seuenth chapter of his booke, and in the first booke of the 1. Chro. 6. Chronicles are reckoned vp vnto Aaron. Now the same Seraiah father to Ezra 
                        2. King. 25. 8. 18. was carried to Riblah, in the land of Hamah, and there slaine, by Nebuehadnezzar King of Babel in the nineteenth yeere of his raigne. So that had Ezra been begot but the Ezra borne before the nineteenth yeere of Nebuchadnezzar. day of his fathers death (which is not likely) yet must he haue been fiftie yeeres aged at the returne from captiuitie in the first yeere of Cyrus: since when, had there been one hundred

and sixe yeeres, as some account, to there building of the Temple, then must Ezra haue been at that time, one hundred fifty sixe yeeres old, an age by much too long to retaine actiuenesse, or to stand (as hee did) Nehem. 8. 3. from morning till midday, to reade, and expound the Law to the people.
                     But to liue a long time after, as it is said he did, euen to the end of the

And therefore the vncertaine accounts of the Heathen must be measured by those men, whom the scriptures haue made their measuring

                     But if the words of Esters Apocrypha may be herd, it was not Kish, but Mordecai; for there Mordecai, a Noble man that dwelt in Susis, and bare office in the Kings Court, was he that had the dreame, and was the man which Nebuchadnezzar brought captiue from Ierusalem, as Chap. 2. 4.

                     Besides, we see that the intent of that story is not to relate of Kish his captiuitie (if any such had been, the miseries of those times now ouerblowne) but rather the meanes that God then wrought to saue his Church by this his instrument Mordecai, that had seene the deliuerance both of himself and others from that Captiuitie of Babylon, and now was an acter to blunt the edge of wicked Hamans sword:

For the chaine of Chronologie linked together by the liues of the holy line, and sacred stories assigned, euen from the first creation, vnto the first yeere of the first Persian Monarch, are as strong for continuance, and as glorious for accounts, as was the 1. King. 6. 21. golden chaine that Salomon drew before the dore of the holy Oracle. But in the link of the The holy Genealogies is a chaine as glorious as Salomons.
                         
                        Persians time is so broken a sunder by the vncertaine records of vncertaine authorities, as it may rather seeme a vexing of the truth, then to leade vs to the true time of Christ his sufferings: therefore to measure the stone by the square, and the Persians whole continuance by the limits of life, let vs see yet further how the sacred Scriptures do direct vs therein. 
                           Nehemiah saw both the beginning and ending of the Persian Monarchy.
                     
                     
                        Nehemiah, a Captaine in Iudah, famous in his booke canonicall, saw both the beginning and ending of the

                        Persians Monarchy, as the text apparantly sheweth, for in the first yeere of Cyrus, among the sonnes of the prouince that went vp out of captiuitie (according to the Edict) this Nehemiah is said to accompany Ezra 2. 2 
                        Zerubbabel the Prince, together with Ieshuah, Seraiah, Mordecai, and others. And that this was the same Nehemiah, who with large grants from King Nehem. 2. 1. 
                        Artaxerxes came again to Ierusalem in the twentieth yere of his raigne, is further confirmed by himself, where he saith; I 
                        Nehem. 7. 5. 
                        found a booke of the Genealogies of them which came vp at the first with Zerubbabel, Ieshua, Nehemiah, Mordecai, and others.
                     
                     And againe, the same man returned to Nehem. 13. 6. 
                        Ierusalem, in the two and thirtieth yeere of the said Kings raigne: whereby we see, that this Nehemiah was in the first yeere of Cyrus, and thirty two of Artaxerxes. For to admit (as Petrus Galatinus hath done) Petrus Gal. contra Iud. lib. 7. c. 12. two Nehemiahs, two Zerubbabels, and two Mordecaies, seeing the Scriptures approue them not, were to make two Moses, two Samuels, and

two Dauids.
                     
                     And that Nehemiah liued to see the end of the Persians raigne, appeareth by his mentioning of the high Priest Iaddua, and of Darius the Persian.
                     
                     And that this was the same Darius whom Alexander ouercame, and the same Iaddua before whom Alexander fell downe to worship that God, whose name he saw ingrauen in the golden plate of his High Priests Mite

                         (besides many Christian Writers) Iosephus the Iew in his eleuenth Ioseph. Ant. lib. 11 booke of their Antiquities, doth euidently declare, whereby the supposed long continuance of the Persians time is bounded within the limits of one mans life, and some part of that also spent, before they aspired to their Imperiall Crowne.
                     But against this, some obiect, that Nehemiah in his old age might liue

                        ld, when he met and told Alexander, that Iosephus antiq. Iude. lib. 11. cap. 8. he was the man of whom Daniel their Prophet prophecied,

                        that should destroy the estate of the Persians.
                     
                     But to the contrary we see by Nehemiah himself, who in the thirteenth Chapter, and twenty eight verse of his booke saith, that one of the sonnes of Ioiada the sonne of Eliashib, the High Priest, was sonne in Law to Sanballat the Horonite, whom he chased from him.
                     
                     And who that sonne was, Iosephus in the foresaid eleuenth book of Antiquities, tels vs to bee Manasses brother vnto Iaddua the High Priest, who had married Nicazo the daughter of Sanballat; for which marriage (saith he) he was expulsed by his brother from the Altar. Whereby we see, that Nehemiah saw not only Iaddua of yeers capable for the dignitie of High Priest-hood; but also his younger brother Manasses, a man married, and of yeeres sufficient to serue at the Altar, which must bee twenty fiue at the least, as the law for the Leuit enioyned: Numb. chap. eight, vers. twentie foure.
                     And that Sanballat likewise (though Psal. 55. 23. 
                        the wicked come not to half
                        
                        their dayes) might see both the beginning & ending of the Persians raigne is apparant; for he being of policie both able to hinder the Neh. 4. 1. worke of of Ierusalems building, and to Chap. 6. entrap Nehemiah the builder, must bee of age answerable to his designes, and therefore of like yeeres vnto him.
                     And the same Sanballat liued to assist Alexander in his surprise of Gaza, after he had ouerthrowne Darius in the last battell. And that Nehemiah and Sanballat were of like age and equall yeeres, the said Ioseph. antiq. Iud. bel. lib. 11. cap. 5. & cap 8. 
                        Iosephus seemeth to auerre, testifying of Nehemiah, that he was laden with age, and that Sanballat two yeeres after the taking of Gaza died, being very old.
                     
                     But to conclude, that no longer continuance then foure hundred and nintie yeeres, may in these seuentie seuens bee granted, let vs measure them from the first to the last, by the liues of the high Saints mentioned by the Euangelist Saint Matthew: where wee 
                           •…
                        ind Ioseph, the husband of Mary, to Matth. 1.
                        
be the tenth in discent from Zerubbabel, a Prince of Iudah, in the first yeere of Cyrus: and that Ioseph liued to the Luk. 2. 24 twelfth yeere of Christ as apparant, yea, to the thirtieth by the testimony of Suidas; who saith, that Ioseph was but newly deceased, when Iesus was chosen a Priest in the Temple.
                     
                     The many yeeres then, and the few successions therein contained, inforce the times continuance no longer then foure hundred and ninety yeeres. For euen in that number, each of these ten generations must successiuely haue their Sonnes borne vnto them at fifty yeeres of age, or not much lesse.
                     Now in like manner, the like Genealogies in the new Testament do confirme the time by the old. number of yeeres (euen foure hundred and ninety, by the Scriptures sure account) were expired betwixt the gouernment of Samuel. and the captiuitie of Ieconiah. in the eight of Nebuchadnezzar, Babels King. And in those yeeres we find recorded by our Euangelist 
                        Luke 3. Saint Luke, twenty generations from Nathan, the sonne

of Dauid, vnto Neri, the father of Salathiel in the dayes of Ieconiah, King of Iudah: but to giue these latter ten generations, more yeeres by many, then the former twenty did passe through in their liues, standeth neither with course of nature, nor hath example in those last times of closing vp the Scriptures records:
                     These ten Fathers therefore so enforce Daniels seuenty Seuens limitation, that some (who extend them to more yeeres) haue thought the Euangelist Saint Matthew hath omitted certaine discents in his record. And In his tree-like Genealogie, printed in Anno 1555. 
                        Tilemanus Stella aduentureth to faine fiue men more into that Catalogue, whom he nameth Hananias, Phaltias, Iesseiah, Raphaia, and Arnaim, onely to draw those yeeres to a longer account. But wee must not admit any such fainings, lest in giuing that liberty against the sacred Record, the authoritie thereof be infringed, and the literall text turned to serue any turne.
                     Thus then the holy Genealogies, 
                        The vse of the holy Genealogies.
                         are as the key of Dauid to open the

truth of Story: and as Salomons pillar to support the waight of times proceeding, without which it is impossible to reade the Scriptures with true vnderstanding.
                     Let this then suffice for their vses in the sacred Chronicle: wherein I vrge them no further, then the Text it selfe doth inforce; and againe appeale to the consciences of their opposers, whether any of these, are the vaine Genealogies, whom Saint Paul condemneth, and so proceede forward to their further vses.

                        IT is the saying of an ancient Father, that the Scriptures are a Sea, wherein the

But to the high conceited, and naturall man, for reach is so deepe, as he hardly can comprehend Psal. 10. 5. what a spirituall motion is, according to the demand of In his answere to Hiero King of Syracusa. Tul. lib. 1 de natur. Deor.

                     How plaine, or profound soeuer, this is commanded, that the Iosh. 1. 8 booke of the Law, bee meditated day and night, and the Iohn 5. 39. Scriptures searched to finde eternall life; for God in sluggards takes no delight.
                     Among the search then of the sacred Word, none seemeth more plaine, then doth the frequent succession, or naturall generation of man: and yet in them such profound deepenesse is found, as may make vs with the Apostle to cry out and say; Rom. 11. 33. 
                        O the depths of the riches both of the wisdome and knowledge of God, how vnsearchable are his Iudgements, and his wayes past finding out. I meane not onely in that mystery, that God would become man in the flesh, and be Heb. 2. 14.

                     For if we looke into the Kingly line of Christ, or into the other collaterals

of Iudahs and other Tribes, 
                        Profound deepenesse in the sacred Genealogies. we shall find such diuersities of Father-hoods, as may cause vs with Iob, to Iob 21. 5

                     Not to mention then the first age or long life of man, wherein some saw fiue hundred yeeres before they were Fathers (though the peopling of the World stood then more vpon necessity) Iudah is the person of eminent note: who in the space of forty three yeeres saw himselfe (after a sort) a great Grandfather in his fourth descent. The fathers from Iudah to Hezron, allowing Shelah mariageable, were not aboue

                     For Phares might haue beene the sonne of Shelah, as is seene by Thamars discontent, for that shee was not made his wife, he then being of yeeres sufficient for mariage. And Phares we know was the Father of Hezron, who was one of the seuenty that went with Iacob into Egypt: and from the yeere of Iudahs birth vnto this of the descending into Egypt, were no more then forty three, as before is proued by Iosephs age; accounting

two yeeres more for the births of Gen. 38. 
                        Er and Onan, that died in their sinnes. A matter strange, and yet is againe exemplified in For so by their births and raignes may be gathered. 
                        Salomon, Achaz, and Amon, Kings of Iudah, each of them fathers at as yong yeeres.
                     But let vs obserue the next generations following, namely, Hezron, Aram, Aminadab, and Naasson, the 
                           Hezron, Aram, Aminadab, & Naassō, saw each of them threescore yeeres before they were Fathers. last three of these being borne in Egypt, and the time no lesse then two hundred and fifteene yeeres, by which account, they could not bee fathers, before each one of them attained vnto threescore yeeres of age, though Naasson, (as truth is) was aboue twenty at his comming out of Egypt: Num. 1. 3. 7. And that he died in the Wildernesse, is manifest by the Text, where it is saide; Num. 26. 64. 
                        Among them that were to enter Canaan, there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron numbred, when they numbred the children of Israel in the Wildernesse of Sinai: for the Lord had said of them, they shall surely die in the Wildernesse.
                     
                     
                        
Now from Naasson let vs continue 
                           Salmon, Boaz Obed, and less were each of them an hundred yeeres old before they were Fathers. the succession thorow Salmon, Boaz, Obed, and Iesse, all of them Fathers, not much younger then Abraham was when Isaac was borne, and

Salmon was borne in the wildernesse, for in Egypt he could not, all dying that came thence: nor could hee be born in Canaan, for he married Rachab in the first yeere of their entrance, and Rachab marriageble then, must be an old mother when shee bare her sonne. 
                        the fourth yeere of Salomon that worke was begun; by which Texts, these foure were each of them Fathers at an hundred yeeres old: for among these foure, foure hundred yeeres were runne.
                     Which so long a time, and but foure generations betwixt, hath moued Fasciulus Temporum, to imagine that Saint Mathew hath made a leape of two hundred seauenty two yeeres,

betwixt Boaz and Obed; and Lyra to thinke that there were more Boazes then one: the Grandfather, the Father, and the Sonne, in Ruth. cap. 4.
                     Gods purposes therefore touching The purpose of God in these vnusuall begettings must be considered. the vnusuall courses of begettings in these ten generations, must be admired, and the depths of Scriptures therein searched, according to the precept of Ioh. 5. 39 
                        Christ, who affirmeth, that Mat. 5. 18. 
                        Heauen and Earth shall passe, but not a iot of his Word euer perish.
                     
                     In the search whereof many learned haue diligently laboured to vnfold the mysteries in the sacred Genealogies, as Iacob did to vncouer the Gen. 29. 10. well in Haran; and doe make these (as all others are) a meanes to withdraw the Exod. 34. 33. 
                        vaile from before Moses 
                        2 Cor. 3. 13. his face, that Christ in them may be seene a Sonne of promise, aboue all naturall No apparant promise was made of Christ to any father betwixt Iudah and Dauid.
                         meanes or hope.
                     For none of the Fathers betwixt Iudah and Dauid, receiued such pregnant promises of the Messiah, as the former Patriarkes before them had done: neither was there any of

                        Christ his Parents, either Prince, Captaine, or Iudge, in that first established gouernement, that might allure expectation: wherby the world might perceiue a farre greater glorie was to proceede through them, then either worldly pompe, or meanes of naturall procreation could beget. The mothers of Christ cōmended.
                     
                     Which thing also was not more manifested in these his Fathers, then it was made apparant in most of his Mothers according to the flesh; who beyond expectation, receiued their fruit, and Gen. 32. 26. wrestled (as Iacob did) to obtaine that blessing.
                     Such were Lea and Rachel, who Gen. 30. 15. stroue for their husband, for no wanton dalliance doubtlesse, but Rab. Simeon cited by D. Willet vpon Gen. 38. to be faithfull Mothers of that blessed Seed. So likewise 
                           S. Ambrose of these mothers saith, They onely desired to haue issue by that chosen Family. 
                        Ruth left her Countrey, and abandoned her kinreds, to be a Mother of the Messiah. And in the rest, wee may see nature (as it were) both oppressed, and quite dissolued: for did not the drie wombes of Gen. 17. 17. 
                        Sara and Rachab (as hopelesse of conception) force nature?

the acts of Gen. 38. 14. 
                        Thamar, and 2 Sam. 11. 2. 
                        Bersheba (as they were cōmitted) offend Nature forced offen ded, and broken. nature? And the conception of the most blessed Luk. 1. 31. 
                        Virgin, wholly dissolue and breake nature when her most happy wombe was made the Tabernacle of GOD, and Cradle of Christ?
                     
                     Vpon whose conception & birth, learned Erasmus paraphraseth thus; As Christ in the first time was promised 
                        The Virgins Euah and Mary compared. 
                        to the Virgin Euah in Paradise: so Christ in the fulnesse of time was borne of the Virgin Mary in Beth-lechem: which signifieth the house of bread. And that hee was the Ioh. 6. bread of life, that came downe from Heauen, himselfe declareth, and was broken for our sinnes, the whole Scriptures sheweth: Lord therefore giue vs beliefe, that wee may eate with him in his kingdome of glory.
                     Againe, in the line of Iudah, and Catalogue of the Fathers of Christ, ariseth a waighty consideration, and no greater then is needfull of a considerate resolution: namely, that in the new Testament, by Saint Luke is Luk. 3. 36.
                        
added, a man more then the old, or Moses hath.
                     For in the Greeke, and third of his A Cainan more then Moses hath. 
                        Gospel, a Cainan is set betwixt Arphaxad, and Sala, contrary to the originall Hebrew by Moses, who nameth Sala, to be the immediate sonne of Arphaxad, without all mention of any such man.
                     And albeit Iansenius, and Genebrard, 
                        
                           Genebrard in 1 Chro. 3. doe account this disagreement but a small slip in History, and Mercerus but a matter of Genealogies, not much to be stood vpon; yet shall we see an vnsufferable absurdity follow, had Moses omitted any generation in his Catalogue: for so both the successions of the Fathers of Christs humanity had beene vncertaine, and the chaine of Chronologie broken asunder, the Worlds computation of those times, being onely calculated by the ages of those Fathers.
                     But that Moses is free from any omission, Moses doth not omit. we must confesse; for who can supply, if he doe omit. And that the Euangelist writ by the same spirit,
                        
we must acknowledge, for that both Testaments were breathed from one, and the same God.
                     
                     The resolution then of this question, resteth vpon the certainty of the Septuagint now extant, whether it be the same that the seauenty two Doctors of the Iewes translated into Greeke, or no.
                     That it is not the same, the testimony of Iosephus (who wrote after most of the new Testament was writ) doth strongly enduce: for approuing the truth of that, their translation saith, that it was most agreeable to the originall Text of Moses: for (saith he) It being finished, and openly read in the audience of the learned Priests and Elders of the Iewes, was 
                        Ioseph. antic. lib. 12. cap. 2. 
                        found to be so exact in all points, as they desired it might bee enacted, that the said Translation should neuer bee altered, nor in one iot changed, but continue inuioalable for euer.
                     
                     But the saide Iosephus himselfe, in his rehersal of the Fathers, from Arphaxad, 
                        
                           Iosephus followeth a true Copy. vnto Abraham, doth name no such Cainan in the saide Catalogue;

whereby it appeareth, that the first and true Septuagint which he followed, had no such man. And the Chalde paraphrast, (of all comments the most antientest) gathered by Ionathan of the Apostles times, vpō that Text of Moses, nameth no other son to Arphaxad, then Sala, nor no other father to Sala, then Arphaxad, without all mention of any such Cainan, which hee would neuer haue done, had the first Septuagint inserted that man.
                     Nay, that Translation it selfe, in the first Booke of Chronicles, where euery particular Father is rehersed from Adam, to Iacobs Tribes, and in all agreeing with Moses; of this last Cainan, no mention at all is made. And yet there want not some, that will haue Moses to omit this Cainan, 
                        Lippomā. Canus, li. 2. de loc. Theo. cap. 18. only to make the number of the later Patriarkes (from Sem vnto Abraham) to be equall to the ten Fathers before the floud.
                     
                        Nauclerus, and Lucidus, to carry an euen hand betwixt both Testaments, will not haue two seuerall, but onely

one man to be meant, affirming The opiniōs of the learned. that the said Cainan, bare the names both of Cainan, & Sala, vnto whom the Tables formerly annexed to our largest Bibles seeme to leaue. Others, with the like reuerence to both, thinke that Cainan and Sala, were brethren, and that Cainan the elder died issulesse; and therefore is by Moses left out, and Sala the younger, (in whose loynes Christ as then lay, is recorded, as in like case Pedaiah (a Father of Christ) is by Saint Luke omitted.
                     
                        Lyra is of opinion, that Cainan was 
                           Nichol. Lyra vpon S. Lukes Gospell. a legall or an adoptiue Father vnto Sala, but that Arphaxad was his naturall begetter, for which cause hee saith, the Septuagint did record them both. And Engubinus the Romanist, goeth further, and chargeth both the Septuagint with error, in inserting of Cainan, and Saint Luke with remisnesse in giuing way to the time, lest in departing from their Translation, in great esteeme with the Gentiles, the credit of his Gospel would be hindered. And learned

                        Iunius (though not approuing the error) somewhat inclineth that way: in saying it was a faultlesse confession in respect of the time, and not a slip or fault of memory, as some would haue it.
                     Vnto all these allegations, sufficient answers might be made: but not any so fully as Saint Augustine, Beroaldus, and Beza, haue made. Saint Augustine, in saying, that the error was 
                        August. ciui Dei. lib. 15. ca 13. 
                        committed in transcribing the copy from Ptolomies Library. Beroaldus, that some Iewish impostor put Cainan into the Text of the Septuagint, to depraue the new Testament of truth, in varying from Moses. And Beza saith, that Cainan was put into the Text of Saint Lukes Gospell, by the ignorance of some, that tooke vpon them to correct it according to the Septuagint: for among many Greeke Copies, hee found an antient manuscript of his Gospell, that had not the man Cainan inserted; vpon which authority, he also leaueth him out, in the new Testament published by himselfe.
                     Yet doe I wish that a tender regard,

and a reuerend respect be had of those sacred Texts, lest in our too curious searching, we sinne, in entring into the hid things that appertaine Deut. 29. 29. vnto God: but rather in beholding the glorious order of that book, laid in the Chest, where Cherubins attend, we couer our feete and faces (the imperfections of our apprehensions and iudgements) as did Isaiahs Seraphins, and with the wings Esay 6. 2. of the body with reuerence & feare, flie betwixt the Texts of both Testaments, euer crying as they did, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts, the whole Earth is full of his glory.
                     Another hard knot, vpon the sacred Seuenty fiue for seuenty. 
                        Genealogies is cast, betwixt the speech of Moses in the Hebrew, and Saint Stephen in the Greeke, touching the number of soules that descended into Egypt: for whereas Moses in the old Testament, writeth that seauenty soules with Iacobs, went into Egypt, and expresly nameth euery particular person, proceeded from his four wiues; Saint Luke in the new, doth Acts 7. 14. thereunto adde fiue more, saying,

that Ioseph caused his Father to bee brought into Egypt, and all his kindred, euen threescore and fifteene soules. This addition as the former, resteth onely vpon the credit of the Septuagint Translation: and therefore let vs here further examine their truthes and certainties, without preiudice I hope either of persons, or cause.
                     Their time was in the dayes of Ptolomy the second, sirnamed Philadelphus, 
                        Euseb. lib. 5. cap. 8. King of Egypt, who to grace his famous Library in Alexandria, sent to the Iewes for sufficient men to translate their Lawes into the Greeke tongue, whereupon seuenty two persons, which were sixe the best learned of euery Tribe were sent.
                     These comming to Alexandria, 
                        The Bible translated. entred vpon the Translation, taking each of them a part of the old Testament, amounting about foureteene chapters (as wee now distinguish them) for a man, as saith the learned Hebrecian, Master Broughton. But In his Epistle to the Nobility. well knowing the Kings desire was more to adorne his famous Library,

then any deuotion hee had to their Lawes, they many times hid their minds in translating: and being among themselues different in gifts, left the rellish of their vaines in a differing degree, as by their parts in translating doth euidently appeare.
                     For the Translaters of Moses were very eloquent, so were they who The Septuagint Translaters. delt with the stories, and they that translated the Psalmes and Prouerbs. The Grecian on Iob (saith hee, was a Poet reader, and cared not to yeeld euery saying strictly, but what might be to Greekes familiar: The Translaters of Ecclesiastes, was yonger in Hebrew then in Greeke: he of Amos not the best; he of Ezekiel very learned: so that the diuersities of The gifts of the Septuagint. their gifts telles vs, that all, did not all.
                     Oftentimes they rather abridge, then translate, as on Hester, and infinitely in the Prophets: and sometimes they enlarge the Text, more like free commenters, then bound Translaters. In misteries and hard phrases, often they deale exceeding

well, but their now hitting, and now missing, shewes, that they followed copies, which were neither vowelled, nor accented, which without exceeding great skill and paines, could not bee truly translated nor vnderstood: and the neerenesse in forme of many of the Hebrew Characters, might cause a mistaking, especially in them, that saw no reason of exact care, when their labour was required onely for a braue Library.
                     Besides, Iesus the sonne of Syrac 
                        
                           Syra in the Prologue of his Booke. (who was a child when these Docters translated) telles how hard it is to translate Hebrew into another Language, whose words (saith hee) carry another force in themselues, then when they are translated. But wee must acknowledge, that neuer since their time, any age afforded so learned, through all the Prophets Emblemes, Hebrew subtilties and None more learned thē the Translaters. Greeke elegancy, as these seauenty two Translaters were: notwithstanding, they liued in those disquiet times of the poore Iewes oppressions,

and the Hebrew tongue for daily vse lost fiue hundred yeeres before.
                     But how this narration of their ouerslips and variances doe agree with Iosephus, for their exactnesse vnto Moses, I see not; onely doe I say, though an errour be admitted, to haue beene committed by these Septuagints: yet in the holy Euangelist can be none, the Spirit of truth being the only inditer: Or that these Hebrew Doctors should mistake the Hebrew Characters, they being so learned, is not like; either so godlesse, as to alter, and adde vnto Moses, knowing it death so to doe. Why Deut. 4. 2. then may we not rather with Austin thinke, that the first Septuagint hath beene corrupted, both in matter and meaning, seeing they haue beene so infinitely maymed by the Translations of Aquilas, Symmachus, Theodotion, and the namelesse interpretet 
                           Paginne Isag. ca. 9. The Septuagint much maimed. Hierome in Ezek. chap. 5. called the fifth Edition, with them of Origens, named the Octaplun.
                     
                     Yea, and Hierome thinketh, these seuenty two Doctors translated but

only the fiue books of Moses: which howsoeuer had been approoued before his time, yet in his time stood farre differing, and was much corrupted from the Hebrew phrase, and therefore not like to be theirs.
                     Againe, in those bookes of Moses, wee see that translation to differ in it selfe: for albeit both in Genesis and in Exodus it accounteth seuenty Gen. 46. Exod. 1. fiue persons to descend into Egypt; yet doth it in Deuteronomy reckon Deut 10. 22. but seuenty, saying, Thy fathers went downe into Egypt with seuenty persons, and now the Lord thy God hath made thee as the Starres of the heauen in multitude.
                     
                     And againe, their departing from Moses his text, is apparant: for wheras he recordeth by name all the seed of Rachel, and rekoneth the number to be fourteene, they translate them to bee eighteene: and for the two soules borne vnto Ioseph in Egypt, they translate fiue: and not as bound Translaters, but as free Commenters, from the first book of the Chronicles, adde Shuthelah, and Tahan, the 1. Chro. 7.
                        
sonnes of Ephraim, and Eden his nephew; Fiue persons added from the booke of Chronicles. and Machir, the sonne of Manasseh, and Gilead his nephew, to bee the fiue persons that filled the number of seuenty fiue that descended into Egypt.
                     
                     And surely this moued Saint Austin to conceiue some great and hid miserie to be contained therein: for so reuerend an opinion hee hath of the first Septuagint, as hee holdeth firmely, that the same Spirit that spake 
                        Aug. ciuit. Dei. lib. 18 cap. 43. 
                        in the former Prophets, spake also in these Translators: and where they dissent from the Hebrew, we must (saith he) hold it their Propheticall depth: for that which was not originally in the Hebrew, it pleased God in them to supply. But he might haue done well to haue added this saying withall; 1. Cor. 7. 12. 
                        It is I that so speake, and not the Lord, who hath so perfited his Word, that it is eternal death to adde, or to diminish Apoc. 22 18..
                     Of the like opinion is Ioseph Ben Gorion, who will haue these Septuagints likewise indued with the Spirit of the Prophets: For (saith d he) they 
                        
                           Ben-gor. in estate of the Maccabes.
                         
                        being separated into diuers chambers
                        
                        apart, and not permitted to see each others copies; notwithstanding agreed exactly in phrase and in words, and in thirteene places of Scripture, of purpose altred the text with so vniforme consent, as if it had been done by one man and one pen.
                     
                     Vnto the which likewise S. Chrysostome and Saint Augustine do agree, but Saint Hierome nothing at all. Nor the famous Iosephus Ben-Matthias 
                        Hier. praefat. in Pentateuth. maketh no such miracle, vnlesse it bee in saying, that the translation was finished in 72. dayes according to the 
                        Ioseph. Antiq. lib. 12. cap. 2. 
                        number of the Translaters. But touching the number descending into Egypt, hee saith, they were seuentie soules, and accounting Iacobs seede by his foure wiues, summeth vp each particular, as Moses hath done.
                     Which is a great inducement vnto me to thinke, that the first Septuagint was not corrupted before Iosephus 
                        The First Septuagint not corrupted. wrote, nor that the Euangelist Saint Luke followed the faultie, but the faithfull copie of those learned Rabbins done in the dayes of Phyladelphus King of Egypt: yet will I not herein preiudice any opinion of the

learned Fathers, ancient and moderne, who haue diligently laboured to vnclaspe this great doubt.
                     Some thinking, as Augustine & Pererius, that the Septuagint (& S. Stephen 
                        The diuers opinions of the learned. speaking from them) are inno error, but that the fiue thereunto added (being borne in Egypt while Ioseph liued) are added by way of anticipation. And Eugubinus the Romanist will admit no fault in the originall, but that it was rather corrupted by some ignorant pen-man in translating the copie. And so Beza the Protestant coniectureth, that the word Pantes (all) by the ignorance of the transcriber was writ pénte (fiue) contrary to the Text of Moses.
                     
                     
                        Iunius iudgeth, that Iacobs foure wiues, and Iudahs two sonnes, Er and Onan (Iacob himselfe being deducted) make the number to bee seuentie fiue: but Rachel, Er and Onan were dead before, and Iacob 
                        Gen. 46. 8 is included in that account. Master Brought. consent.
                         
                        Broughton will haue the corruption purposely done by the first Translaters themselues, who knowing that

                        Ptolomies intent was no further, but to furnish his stately Library with choise and cost, to preuent his flouts and fury (lest in pretext of Religion hee should surprize them, as his Father Lagi had done) altred their text both in Chronologie and Genealogie, 
                        Ioseph. Antiq. lib. 12. cap. 1. (the two speciall pillars of truth and of knowledge) & obseruing this caueat, Cast not holy things vnto dogs; hid their diuine mysteries frō his profane Egyptians, whom they held accursed.
                     And long before him was Saint Hierom of the same mind, who saith, that these seuenty Translaters to conceale 
                        
                           Hieroms opinion not to be aprooued. 
                        the secrets of their faith from the Heathen, did omit the speciall principals of faith vnto the Egyptians, whom they held to be a cursed Nation, and not worthy of their sacred Lawes. But hereunto may bee answered, that these reuerend Translaters were religious, and knew by the Prophets, that the Gentiles should be called, and the meanes of their calling to bee the Word of God; which had they hid or altered, then had they been resisters of God in his ordinary course of saluation.

From which they are so free, as in many places they adde to the texts of their callings, more then the originals haue; as in Fsay, where it is said, The roote of Ishai shall stand vp 
                        Isai. 11. 10 
                        for a signe vnto the people, the Nations shall seeke vnto it, and his rest shall bee glorious, they adde this saying, And in his Name shall the Gentiles trust: whom Paul in that text followeth; Ro. 15. 12. and in many others, both he and the holy Euangelists doe: which must mooue an holy opinion of those reuerend men.
                     But Caietan hath a further conceit, Caietan. in Gen. 11 namely, that the Iewes enuying to haue their holy lawes made knowne to the Gentiles by a transcript into another A meero conceit without shew of truth. tongue: did of set purpose alter diuers things in their translation; so that the Hebrew (saith he) hath the defect, but the Septuagint the truth. Vnto whom, and whose opinion, let Saint Austin giue answere, though he hath allowed those translater to ranke with the Prophets.
                     
                     
                        Whether doth it seeme more probable (saith he) that the Iewes, so large an nation,
                        
                        and their bookes so farre dispersed 
                        Aug. ciuit. Dei. lib 15 cap. 13. 
                        through the whole world, could falsifie theirs; or that the Translators being but seuenty, and in one place assembled; themselues also Iewes, and enuying that the Gentiles should enioy their Scriptures: did put in these errors by a common assent, and which is easier to effect, who seeth not. But God forbid (saith he) that any wise man should thinke, that either the Iewes of purpose corrupted their bookes, or the translators with assent concealed the truth from the Gentiles: one may easier beleeue, that the error was committed in the transcription of the copie from Ptolomies 
                        
                           Augustines answere to the conceit. 
                        Liberary, and that to haue a successiue propagation through all copies dispersed. And thereupon concludeth.
                     That it was neither the corruption of the originall, nor the ouersight of the Translators, but rather the Transcribers error, that copied it first from Ptolomies Liberary. But howsoeuer (saith he) seeing both cannot bee true, it is better to beleeue 
                        The originall is safest to trust too. 
                        the originall, then the translation.
                     
                     A like (if not a more difficult) knot, is cast vpon the Genealogies, recorded by Saint Matthew: who in casting

his Catalogue into three fourteene Saint Matthewes three fourteene generations. generations: in the second doth omit certaine descents of Iudahs Kings; and in the last doth differ from the number that himselfe assigneth: which here wee will assay to vnloose, not preiudising any former opinion, nor inforcing ours further then the Word will allow.
                     It is Austins opinion, that the numbers set in the holy Scriptures (though to Ciuit. Dei. some they seeme barren, or of little vse) are most fruitfull, and to singular purposes penned, containing in them many both excellent and diuine matters.
                     
                     If this be thus obserued of the generall, then is this particular of a 
                           Abraham the first of Promise, and Dauid the first King by Couenant. speciall regard; that from Abraham the first father that had promise of a King and Kingdome, vnto Dauid, who was the first King that had his succession established by God, the Euangelist recordeth them that were produced betwixt.
                     And Dauids heires likewise, by Salomon, through his naturall line vnto Ieconiah the last, and his legall Line vnto Ioseph, the supposed father

of Iesus, who was the most lawfull, and last King of the Iewes, he continueth the succession: and for the The double vse of Saint Matthew his Catalogue. more ease of memory and state of the matter, diuideth them into three fourteene generations, amounting to forty two persons of that Kingly Line, from Abraham vnto Christ. Of which diuisions and number, many coniecturs haue made, and many of them fetched farre beyond likelihood or reason.
                     In the search of which seeming vnsoundable depth, thinke not that I derogate from others, when I dissent from them in their diuers and many expositions: for euery mans sacrifice 
                        1. Cor. 3. 13. 
                        must bee tried by the fier of Gods Altar. Neither that I affect singularitie in mine owne: for I know that a three-fold cord is strong, and a woe is to

And yet doe not so vrge what I write, as to force a consent, without the freedome of thy further examination; and if better be found, doe

cleaue to the best.
                     First then, for the number two and forty inclusiuely gathered, but not so named by the holy Euangelist, the Ethiopian translation (therein ouerbold) doth ad a sentence more to his text, then hee euer wrote, in saying, that all the generations from Abraham 
                        Ethiopian Translation in Mat. 1. Glose ordinary vpon Matthew 1. 
                        to Christ were two and forty.
                     
                     Which number the ordinary glosse will haue to be mystically set in the entrance of the Cospell, for a remembrance of the two and forty Stations in the Wildernesse, before the entrance into Canaan. And that as sixe seuens were neerely spent, vnder the leading of Moses, and vnder Ioshuah a Sabbath, when he set the people in rest, so these sixe seuen generations were the Stations of hope, till Christ, the true Sabbath, by his death brought his, into his eternall rest.
                     Which allusion is more tollerable, then the Gloser hath made vpon the numbers assigned in the diuisions: for by those three, he will haue the Trinitie signified: who as they are three in one, so this number is

made three of one. And as misticall is this; that as ten and foure, make the summe to bee fourteene; so the Law in the ten commandements, and The mysticall applications of the ordinary Glosse. the Gospell in the foure Euangelists, are tipically shewed in each of these fourteene generations.
                     
                     And of the like kind is that which Iohannes Ferus, and others conceiteth, namely, that by these fourteene 
                        Iohn Ferus in Mat 1. 
                        generations, the state of the world from the creation through all generations succeeding are contained. And Piscator will haue them to signifie the generations before the Law, vnder the Law, and in the time of grace.
                     
                     And to the like purpose Marlorat speaketh, that will haue them meane, the politicall estate of the Iewes common wealth vnto Christ. Whereof the first, from Abraham to Dauid were vnder the gouernment of Iudges; the second from Dauid 
                        Three estates of the Iewes. vnto the captiuitie were vnder the subiection of Kings; and the third were ruled by the power and pollicie of the High Priests: not obseruing in this his second number, saith he, a

                        lineall succession of Kings, as they were produced and raigned; but rather accounting it sufficient, to set the order of that fourteene, from the beginning vnto the end of that Kingdome.
                     
                     Vnto the former, or Ferus his opinion, we see no reason to answere, seeing there is no reason so to coniecture; neither vnto Marlorat, the later, wherein no resemblance can bee made betwixt the politicall estate of the Iewes, and the numbers assigned: the one being a succession of Patriarkes and Princes, and the other an estate often broken, and no face of a Common-wealth many times seene.
                     And to what purpose should holy Mathew remember those dead times of sinne, seeing his pen was set vpon Mat. 6. 16. another subiect, and his text the forbidding of worldly state, pompe, and vaine riches, to the attaining of that Kingdome which Christ came to preach. But the same Author from others alleageth, that Saint Matthew 
                        Augustine Marlorat vpon Matthew 1. 
                        in his daies followed an order and manner of bringing and placing genealogies and
                        
                        pedegrees, which now is vnknowne vnto 
                        The text intangled with vaine conceits. 
                        vs: and recordeth in his Catalogue diuers men by other names, and yet they the same that Saint Luke hath in his.
                     And others more intollerable, to affirme, that the Euangelist by obliuion 
                        A dangerous assertion, and not to be granted. 
                        omitteth those, that elsewhere are named in the bookes of the Kings and the Chronicles; grounding their coniecture vpon the many, and farre more generations, recorded in the catalogue of S. Luke, then S. Matthew hath in his.
                     For Luke from Zorubbabel vnto Marie the Virgin, hath ten more in his role, then Saint Matthew from Zorubbabel vnto Ioseph her husband Differences in families. hath laid downe: whereby they iudge, that some men by him are omitted, and account it neither sinne, nor absurditie to reckon lesse of the legall, as Saint Matthew doth, then of the naturall, as Saint Luke in following the lineall hath done: the one of them taking liberty of omission A libertie assumed without warrant. (say they) to cast his fourteenes into equall numbers: but the other tied by

a requisite order, to record the naturall successors to their naturall parents.
                     
                     To the first and difficult order of the Euangelist, we answere; it is so farre from all likelihood, that wee euidently see the contrary by Saint Matthew himselfe: for from Abraham 
                        Saint Matthew most plaine in setting downe his pedegrees. to Dauid, and from Salathiel to Ioseph, his manner and order is so plaine, as nothing can be more. And so farre are the double names from meaning the same persons, that not any one of them in either of the Euangelists are one and the same, excepting onely Salathiel, Zorobbabel, and Ioseph the husband of Marie.
                     
                     And to the second we say, it is so Saint Matthew is more frequent in alleaging the Prophets, then any other of the Euangelists. farre from obliuion or ignorance in the Euangelist, as that hee confirmes by other Scriptures what himselfe writes; and is most frequent in applying the Prophets to the purpose of his text, both in the Parents and person of Christ.
                     
                     As Isaiah 
                        Esay 7. for his stem, and sonne of a Virgin; Micah 
                        Micah. 5. 2. for his Tribe, and place of his birth. Hoshea 
                        Hosh. 11. 1. for his calling out of Egypt. Zachari 
                        Zach. 9. 9
                        
for his lowlines and contempt. Dauid 
                        Psal. 22. for the maner of his death: and Ionas 
                        Ion. 1. 17 in the Whale, for a signe of his graue and buriall: and all of them concurring to that Babe in his text.
                     And that it is not vnusuall in the holie Scriptures for generations in Some families exceed others in long life. some families to exceede others in numbers, we see: for not only Sem liued through ten generations, euen to the fiftieth yeere of Isaac, but also in other ages following, great differences doe appeare.
                     For the Patriarch Iudah saw himselfe in a sort, a great grand-father in his fourth descent, when as Leui his brother was but an immediate father in his first. In the Priests line 1 Kin. 2. 27 likewise, from Abiathar, whom Salomon expulsed, vnto Seraih, whom Nebuchadnezzar slew, were but 2 Chr. 25. 18. twelue generations: whereas in the Kings from Salomon to Ieconiah, whom Nebuchadnezzar captiuated, there were twenty.
                     Nay, what more is; fiue onely of Fiue of Iudahs, saw seuenteene of Leui.
                         
                        Iudahs Tribe, namely, from Naasson in the wildernesse, vnto Iesse the Father

of Dauid, liued and saw no lesse then seuenteene of Leui his Tribe, that is, from Korah that perished in Num. 16. 1 Sam. 16. the Wildernesse, vnto Samuel the Prophet, that annointed Dauid. Thus then the obiection of the vnequalitie of Families is taken away by the text of Scriptures that allow the like, or more, in more places then one. But from these generals, let vs come to the parts, and consider the diuisions by Saint Matthew assigned, of fourteene, fourteene, and fourteene generations.
                     
                     The first whereof we find by Moses, and by the writer of the Booke of Ruth, both in number, and in Ruth, 4. 18. names to be most exact, and therefore thereof we need not to speake: But of the secōd we are to examine.
                     First, how many there be, and who they are that are omitted, and the How many, and who they are that are omitted. reasons or causes of their omissions. And in the last, to cōsider by whom, and how the number fourteene is made compleat, when as but thirteene are nominated by the Euangelist himselfe.
                     
                        
For the number that are omitted in Saint Mathewes second diuision, some account them to be three, and some to be foure, according to the How many Saint Mathew omitteth. diuers readings found in the Greeke Copies, either including or excluding Iacim the last. But if it may be determined by most voyces, then hath Iacim no place in that holy catalogue. For Robert Stephens, that most learned Printer, in the sixteene seuerall Copies, which he conferred for the edition of the Greeke Testament, onely one (of his number the fourteenth) hath Iacim: but in all the rest, no such man is found.
                     Againe, of forty seueral editions since conferred, and most of them printed in Paris, Geneua, Basil, London, Antwerpe, Leyden, and Rome; onely eight of them haue Iacim, whereof sixe of that number haue beene printed in London: so that but two of forty impressions, haue recorded his name, howsoeuer he hath beene insreted in ours. And how Saint Mathewes 
                        Onely two of forty Editiōs haue Iacim.
                         Text is translated into diuers languages, see here as followeth.
                     
                        
                        And Iosias begat Iechonias, and his 
                        Greeke. 
                        brethren in the captiuity of Babylon.
                     
                     Iusia begat Iuchonia, and his brethren, 
                        Syriac. 
                        in the captiuity of Babel.
                     
                     Iuschia begat Iuchonia, and his brethren, 
                        Arabick. 
                        in the captiuity of Babell.
                     
                     Ioshia begat Iuchoniah, and his brethren, 
                        Persian. 
                        in the captiuitie of Babell.
                     
                     Iosias begat Iechonias, and his brethren, 
                        Saxon. 
                        in the captiuitie of Babylon.

                        Our Kings Bible. 
                        brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon.
                     
                     So hath Hierom, Augustine, and the None almost hath Iacim.
                         ancient: so hath Mountanus, Beza, and the moderne, and indeed so haue all that haue their names prefixed to any Impression (those former excepted) without any mention of Iacim at all.
                     
                        
Concerning then the persons omitted, wee see they were foure Kings of Iudahs Throne. Three of Foure kings omitted by S. Mathew them in a direct line of succession, and the fourth, nine discents following: which were Ahaziah, Ioash, and Amaziah: and the last Iacim, the son of Iosiah.
                     
                     For whereas Saint Mathew saith, that Ioram the sonne of Iehoshaphat, begat Ozias, it is most manifest by the Bookes of the Kings, and of the Chronicles, that Ioram begat Ahaziah, and not Uzziah: and Ahaziah begat Ioash, and Ioash begat Amaziah, and Amaziah Vzziah, 68 yeeres after the death of King Ioram.
                     
                     But why these foure particular persons aboue the rest should be omitted, is questionable: some thinking that it was the mistaking of St 
                        Mathew, in writing Ozias for Uz. ziah, 
                        A dangerous opiniō. and by obliuion left that line of Ioram vnto his third descent, which in no case may be admitted.
                     For God forbid that the first writer of the new Testament should be ignorant of that which the olde

wrote, whose pen though his, and he a man, yet was the Inditer the Spirit of Truth, and farre from all imperfections of men.
                     Some likewise alleage, that for the Iewes weaknesse, Christ would not haue his holy publican Mathew, to name 
                        In an Epistle sent for that defēce. 
                        the wicked Ahaziah, the Cain-Ioash, the foolish Amaziah, nor the Atheist Iehoiakim, in that catalogue vnto which himselfe was the onely heire, but as the scumme of the World, vnworthy of remembrance, leaues them vnnamed, as though they had neuer beene.
                     And some again iudge these foure to be omitted for their many impieties, both in their liues and raignes: and for their euill ruling, to be left out of that holy Text, as worthlesse of names, or remembrance.
                     Whereunto we answere, that the Iewes were not weake in the Texts of their stories, we see by their many Comments, though in the applications The weakenesse of the Iewes no immediate cause. many times they missed: but especially in the line of their Kings were most ready, from whom they

expected their potent Messiah. And had they beene ignorant, yet Christ the truth, would not haue smothered the truth, in regard of their follies.
                     Neither doth their silence for bad The wickednesse of the Kings not the only cause. life and euill ruling onely, satisfie: for many other Kings as wicked, or more, are notwithstanding by the Euangelist recorded: as Ioram that compelled Iudah vnto Idolatry, for which his guts by peece-meale daily fell out, and his life so loathed, as it is said of him; He liued, not being desired.

                     To this may be answered, as Ezekiel doth the prouerbe: The Fathers 
                        Ezek. 18.

Mothers as were most tainted with sinne. And if the goodnesse of the Father be regarded in the Son, why was not wicked Iehoiakim the sonne recorded for his fathers sake good Iosiahs. And therefore we may think some other cause moued the Euangelist to omit their names.

                         first omissiōs, namely, from the threats therein contained against Idolatrous posterities, where it is said; The Lord is a iealous God, visiting the iniquity of the Fathers 
                        Exod. 20. 4 
                        vpon the children, vnto the third, and fourth generation.
                     
                     
                        And these (saith he), being the seede of most wicked Parents, vnto the fourth 
                        
                           St Hieromes opinion of omission. 
                        generation, are omitted by the holy Pen of Grace. For Ioram King of Iudah, had to wife Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab, King of Israel, and of Idolatrous Iezebel, the Zidonian worshipper of Baal. And of Athaliah, was borne Ahaziah, who begat Ioash and hee Amaziah, the fourth in descent from that wicked bed of marriage.
                     
                        
To this collection of Ierome I could well assent, if it did likewise include the fourth man Iehoiakim. But hee being the twelfth in descent of the bloud of Iezebel, is notwithstanding omitted; whereas nine betwixt them, and Iechoniah after him, are in Saint Mathewes Catalogue recorded, and therefore this his obseruation fitteth not well: for the same cause that moued their omissions, moued his, but that did not, therefore that was not the cause.
                     Neuerthelesse, wee know Ahabs seed by Iezebel, had a manifest curse of vtter destruction, that his house should be swept from the earth, as dung

                     If then these exceptions may be iustly taken against these diuers expositions, by diuers men alleaged, let vs yet heare further what may be saide was the cause, though not vrging consent without further examination.
                     It is most apparant, that the Euangelist

Saint Mathew to answere this demand of the Wise-men, Where is hee that is borne King of the Iewes: 
                        Math. 2 2 sheweth the babe Iesus of Iudah, Dauid & Bethlehem to be the said King▪ confirming his assertion by his tribe, 
                        The cause that moued S. Mathew to omit four Kings. 
                        parents, and place of birth, from the Prophets that spake it, and the most lawfull right hee had, vnto Iudahs Kingdome, from those lawful Kings that without debarre of title, or exceptions of the people, had sate vpon Indahs throne.
                     And that the affections of the people, is to ioyne with his title at a Kings inauguration, the most learned King of all the Worlds Kings, our Soueraigne Lord King Iames, hath set it for a speciall obseruation in his Maiesties Dedicated to Prince Charles his royall Sonne. Booke so intituled: for saith he, though Monarchies, or hereditary kingdomes cannot iustly be denied to the lawfull successor, whatsoeuer the affections of the people be: yet it is a great signe of the blessing of God, when he enters in it with the willing applause of his subiects, and raignes by the loue and acknowledgement of his people.
                     
                     
                        
But it seemeth so had not Ahaziah, 
                        The foure that are omitted. 
                        Ioash, Amaziah, nor Iehoiakim done, but had exceptions against, either in their owne titles, or in the affections of the people, or both: and therefore Saint Mathew spareth to record them among the Catalogue of Salomons other successors, that so the title of Iesus to the Kingdome might stand firme, without any debarre or exceptions howsoeuer.
                     First then of Ahaziah the first, it is said that he was the youngest sonne of

                        wiues, and his other sonnes; so that there was not a sonne left him▪ sauing Ahaziah the youngest: 2 Chro. 21. 17. And albeit in the next Chapter it be said, that the Philistines with the Arabians had slayne all the eldest sonnes; yet before their slaughter, which was in Ethiopia, (for thither they were brought) the Inhabitants of Ierusalem had made Ahaziah the youngest sonne King: contrary to the Law ordained Deut. 21. 16. in Deuteronomy, which giueth

the royalty alwayes to the eldest. And Ahaziah himselfe being as wicked 2 Chro. 22. 3. 7. as any, walked in the wayes of the house of Ahab: for his mother Athalia counselled him to doe wickedly; for which and his other defects, hee was lastly slaine by Iehu King of Israel, when hee executed Gods threats vpon the House of Ahab.

                     For in the rage and vsurpation of 2 King 11. 
                        Athaliah, he was hid in the Temple by his Aunt Iehoshabeath: and lastly, preferred to the Throne by Iehoiada her Husband, which kindnesse he requited with the slaughter of Zechariah 
                        2 Chr. 24. 21. their sonne, slaine at his commandement in the Court of the Lords house: for which, and for the bloud he had spilt, his seruants conspired against

him in his house at Millo, and slew him, his body not permitted to haue the honour of buriall in the Sepulchers of the Kings, and therefore vnworthy of name, or of future remembrance.
                     
                        Amaziah the third, was not a preseruer Exceptions against Amaziah.
                         of the Commonwealths state (as Kings ought to be) but rather the destroyer of state & Kingdome, as by his raigne is seene.
                     For besides his Idolatry to the Idols of Edom, and the prouoking thereby of Gods wrath; in his headstrong rashnesse hee prouoked Ioash, King of Israel, to fight against Iudah: 
                        2 Chr. 25. 17. wherein himselfe was taken, the treasures of the Temple and of the Kings house carried away, and the wall of Ierusalem broken downe, in length foure hundred cubits, and afterwards he liued in dislike without loue: in so much as his people pursued him from Ierusalem vnto 
                           Amaziahs death vnreuenged. 
                        Lachish, & there slew him, his death not reuenged, but his murtherers escaping all condigne punishments.
                     And after his death, for the hatred

the people bare him, his Crowne for 
                           Broughtō
                            in Consent. an eleuen yeeres space was helde from Vzziah his sonne, and an interregnum in Iudah betwixt the death of the father, and the raigne of the sonne so long: for by the parerellizing raignes of the Kings of Iudah and Israel, Amaziahs death fell in the fifteenth of Ieroboam, King of 2 Kin. 14. 1 2 Kin. 15. 1 
                        Israel, and Uzziah beganne not to raigne, til the twenty seuen yeere of the same King. These things considered, might wel moue an omission of his name by Saint Mathew.
                     
                     And in Iehoiakim the last, some disliked defects were knowne: for that the people of the Land reiected him for their King, and annointed Iehoahaz his yonger brother by two yeeres in his stead, contrary to the vsuall custome of succession.
                     And Iehoiakim himselfe being made King by Necho King of Egypt, his title standeth litigious, for the Law commanded by Moses, thus speaketh: From among thy brethren 
                        Deut. 17. 15. 
                        shalt thou make a King ouer thee; thou shalt not set a stranger ouer thee, which is
                        
                        not thy brother.
                     
                     If then a stranger must not be permitted Exceptions against Iehoiakim.
                         a King to raigne ouer Gods people, then by the same Law a stranger could not impose his substitute ouer them, as Iehoiakim was. And Iehoiakims title it selfe seemeth to stand in a double defect.
                     The one is, that he did assume the title and authority of King, his brother aliue, annoynted, and established: whereas Dauid, though chosen of God, and annoynted by Samuel, acknowledged Saul for his Soueraigne; neither seeking to shorten 1 Sam. 16. 13. his life, nor disquiet his raigne. And the other is, the vnlawfull meanes hee had to the Crowne, which was by the strong hand of Necho of the cursed Egyptians, the ancient enemies to Israel Gods people.
                     And Iehoiakims life as wicked as any, in cutting of Ieremiahs Role, was cut off by Nebuchadnezzar King of Babel; and his carkasse cast out of the gate of Ierusalem, to the heate of Ier. 36. 30 the day, and frost of the night, was lastly, vnlamented, buried as an Asse Ier. 22. 19.
                        
is buried; so contemptible was his life, death, and buriall.
                     These I assume were the causes of The cause of the foure Kings omissions. these foure Kings omissions, that is to say, the first and last, not lawfully succeeding in the Throne, were omitted; and the other, the one of them not able to attaine the Crown for the space of sixe yeeres after his fathers death, did not raigne King; and the sonne of the other, for the space of eleuen yeeres after his fathers death, was not admitted to be King: so vnwilling were the people that his issue should raigne.
                     It is Augustines obseruation, that August. Quest. 85. 
                        Salomon was reckoned for Dauid his fathers sake, and that Rehoboam was recorded for Assa his sonnes sake. If so in them such respect was had for the goodnesse of the father and the son, then in these such contempt was had for the badnesse both of father and sonne, as they are omitted and vnnamed: and themselues slaine by their seruants and subiects, doth confirme the cause of their omissions more strongly.
                     
                        
And albeit that bad Ammon, and 
                           Ammon and Iosiah slaine, and yet are recorded. good Iosiah were likewise slaine, the one by his seruants, and the other by Necho King of Egypt: and that Zedekiah by Nebuchadnezzar a stranger, was likewise made King, and all of them notwithstanding recorded by Saint Mathew; yet are not their estates alike.
                     For Ammons death was reuenged 2 Kin. 21. 24. by the people of the Land, and Iosiahs death lamented both by the people, 2 Chr. 35. 24. and the Prophet, neither of which the other were.
                     And Nebuchadnezzar made the great Ier. 27. 6 Monarch of the World, euen by Dan. 2. 37. God himselfe, had thereby a lawfull power, both to set vp, and to depose Kings, which Necho had not; and therefore Zedekiah his title is not to be called in question as Iehoiakims is.
                     Whereupon wee conclude, that the Euangelist Saint Mathew, to shew the right that Iesus had vnto Iudahs Crowne, recordeth his title onely from those Kings that were without all exceptions estated vnto

                        Iudahs. Throne: and omitteth those, Christs title without exceptions. against whom any exceptions are found, that so Christ who came to fulfill all Lawes, might haue a lawfull succession vnto that Kingdome whereunto he was borne: for other materiall reason of omission we find none. And this being said of the second, we come to the third.
                     The third and last diuision of the The third diuision of S. Mathew. Euangelist, is from the captiuity of Babylon, vnto Iesus Christ, wherein onely thirteene generations and no more, (Iesus himselfe being also included) are nominated, though in the summe they are accounted to be fourteene.
                     To fill vp which number. 1. Some 1. will haue two Iechoniahs, and them to be the father and sonne. 2. Some 2. but one Iechoniah, and he to be twice accounted. 3. Some that the Virgin 3. 
                        Mary is to be reckoned for a generation among them. 4. And some that the Text is therin faulty, which 4. assertion is most vnsufferable.
                     That there were two Iechoniahs, is the opinion of Isidore, who will 1. Isidors opinion.
                        
                        
haue the one in the end of the second diuision, and the other in the beginning of the third: and that they were the father and the sonne, Rabanus affirmeth; the father and sonne (saith hee) both of them bearing one and the same name, you haue the one in the end of the second, and the other in the first of the third diuision. And with him Epiphanius agreeth, who saith, that Ioachim 
                        Epiph. Cont. Heres. lib. 1. 
                        the sonne of King Ioachim, had the same name that his sonne Iechoniah had: and checketh them for ouerbold and vnlearned, that put out his name in the second place. Vnto them both let Ierome answere, who hath very well obserued, and noted, that the father is euery where written Iehoiakim, with 
                        The father and the sons names differing in Character. K & M. but the sonne Iehoiachin, with C H & N.
                     That Iechoniah must be twice accounted, is the collections of our later 2. Augus marl. vpon Mathew 1. Writers, who know not how to make vp the number to bee foureteene, except Iechoniah should be put twice, that so in him (say they) the head of the third generation might be appointed. But there is no reason so to imagine,

seeing no honour from him any wise accrued vnto them, to bee the head of that holy generation, himselfe being a cast-off Signet from Gods right hand.
                     
                     It is Augustines saying also, as that 
                        S. Augustin 
                        which is bowed in a corner ends, on the one side, and beginnes on the other: so is Iechoniah put in the end of the former, and in the beginning of the last; wherein the ordinary Glosse 
                        Gloss. ordin. Mathew 1. vnderstandeth a great mistery.
                     For by the one, which was his transmigration into Babylon, he will haue signified the transmigration of A misticall interpretation. the Apostles among the Gentiles, and by the other, in writing him the first after the captiuity, The resurrection of our Lord vnto life: and in them both, a figure of Christ, who is the corner stone of the building, the resurrection and life. But that is ouer farre fetched, and forced to an vnfit application: for neuer is Christ figured by a castaway, Ier. 2
                              •…
                           . 
                              •…
                           4 as Iechoniah is called a Signet pluckt from Gods finger.
                     The third, is the opinion that Marie 
                        3. the Virgin for her sanctity, is of

her selfe to be accounted a generation among her holy Fathers: But against The Virgin Mary is not in account among the generations. that the whole streames of generations doe flow, who are euer accounted from the man, and neuer from the woman. And Iesus himselfe, who was to fulfill all Scriptures, wee see in the catalogue of both the Euangelists, to be brought from Ioseph the man: and Ioseph to be of Nazeret, of Bethlehem, of Iudah, and of the lineage of Dauid, all the adiuncts attributed vnto Christ.
                     
                     And Mary ioyned with Ioseph in 
                           Ioseph & Mary make but one generation. mariage, both together make but one generation: for man and wife are one house, one family, and one flesh; and therefore not two generations, else had the former foureteenes beene each of them twenty eight, for each of them had his wife.
                     But that the blessed Virgin had no enumeration of family among those Fathers of Christ, is apparant: for that shee hath neither place of birth, tribe, nor family distinctly named, otherwise then the wife of Ioseph: that so Iesus her sonne might come

in the flesh, and be heire of all righteousnesse, as all other heires for inheritances from the man had beene euer accounted.
                     Lastly, that the Text is faulty, is the collection of Marlorat from others 4. A dangerous position. vpon Mathew 1. vers. 8. where they say: Where as in some Bookes thirteene are onely read, it is likely that it came to passe by the fault and negligence of the writer of the Booke. Which in no wise may be granted, for to charge the sacred writ with any imperfections, is to open a way to any interpretation, against which the Massorites 
                        Massorites preseruers of the text. haue most diligently laboured in preseruing euery letter in the body of the holy text, so that not any one can be missing, much lesse any word or sentence.
                     If then neither Ieconiah, nor the Virgin Marie bee contained in this last fourteene generations, how shal the number thereof bee made compleate, and the Euangelist Matthew to agree in his owne account. The answere is:
                     Howsoeuer men haue failed in

their many coniectures, and dissented in their diuers opinions; yet in this last diuision are fourteene generations found to bee full and compleate; beginning in Salathiel the first of this last, and ending in Christ the Omega of the Scriptures Genealogies. For apparant it is by the first of the Chronicles, Chapter the third, and ninteenth verse, that Pedaiah was by nature the sonne of Salathiel, and the father of Zorobabel, and is to 
                           Pedaiah supplieth the number of fourteene. be verily accounted among the naturall fathers of Christ. Yet because he was borne, and died obscurely in Babylon, before his father Salathiel was declared the childlesse Ieconiahs successor, he is euer in all other texts of both Testaments omitted. And where Zorobabel is named from his parant, he is euer called the sonne of Salathiel, as heire vnto him, that was made heire vnto the Crowne, & not of Pedaiah that was neuer interested therein.
                     If then the old Testament bee silent for Pedaiah (excepting his once naming in the Catalogue of Iudahs
                        
                        Genealogies) Saint Matthew in the New, was to omit his name in the Catalogue of them that stood estated 
                           Pedaiah had no estate in the Crowne. for the Crowne: but not his number among his generations produced: that man then being included, maketh this last diuision to be exactly fourteene generations, according to the Euangelists words & account. And how these are and may be reckoned, see here their diuisions, as the holy Ghost hath assigned.

Thus then Pedaiah being (as most apparant it is) a father of Christ, must be in numeration among the fathers of Christ, though not to bee named a successor vnto Salomons throne: nor is the Euangelists omission of him, The cause of Pedaiahs omission. more against order, then was the omission of the three former, in the former diuision of three Kings, in a direct line: and all to shew (as is said) the lawfull succession that Iesus had vnto Iudahs Crown.
                     This last collection I see not how to be excepted against, it hauing so sure a warrant by the holy Scripture it selfe: for heauen and earth shall passe, ere the word perish, Salathiel 
                        Luk. 16. 17 1 Chro. 3. 17, &c. 
                        his Sonne Pedaiah, and the sonne of Pedaiah Zorobabel.
                     
                     But why Pedaiah is not recorded for a naturall father of Christ, in the Catalogue of his naturall fathers by the Euangelist Saint Luke, where all vnto Adam are nominated; is hid from me: and therefore with Nazianzen will I say, Where I vnderstand I will thankefully praise thee; and where I vnderstand not, I will fall downe and
                        
                        admire thee. And with Dauid pray, Psal. 119. 105. that thy word may be a lanterne vnto our feete. And with Paul, that our darknes may be made light in Christ.
                     
                     Another meditation ariseth in other families of Iudahs tribe, so deep and doubtfull, that Hugo de S. vict. 
                        Hugo de Saint Victor, thinketh it a question vndissoluable, and without further search so leaueth it; which is, how Caleb of Hezron at forty yeeres old, could be either great Grand-father vnto Bezaleel the skilfull workmen in the Tabernacle, or the searcher of the Land at the same yeere and time: He being the fifth in an equall equipage pararellising Bezaleel; and both of them borne in Aegypt from Hezron of Iudah, and actiue men together in the wildernesse: the one in ordering the curious workes from the patterne shewed by God himselfe vnto Moses, and the other a Captaine that descried the riches of Canaan by his owne trauaile: whose dissents for more plainnesse I haue here set downe to sight.
                     
                        
                        
                           The Descents of Caleb and Bezaleel.
                           
                           How Caleb and Bezaleel were actiue men together; though differing in their descents.
                           The Sercher of the Land of Canaan.
                           Both actiue men in one age.
                           The skilful workman in the Tabernacle.
                        
                     
                     
                        
In this descent then, whether the first Caleb, the sonne of Hezron, and great Grand-father vnto Bezaleel, or the last Caleb, paralelising Bezaleel through so many degrees; were the Lands-searcher, both of them come from the same Hezron, and actiue men together at one time in the wildernesse, hath been much controuersed, and many opinions maintained with variable iudgements.
                     That the Lands-searcher was the The vnwarrantable reconciliation of the Rabbins. 
                        great Grandfather vnto Bezaleel, Rabbi Salom, a great Doctor of the Iews, bringeth a strange & vnexemplified descent vnto Bezaleel: for (saith hee) Rabbi Solomoh cited by D. Willet vpon Exod. chap. 31. 
                        Caleb at eight yeres old married his first wife Azuba, who died the first yere of her mariage, & in his ninth, he took Ephrath, otherwise called Miriam, the sister of Moses, for his second wife; of whom in his tenth yeere was borne Hur: and Hur in the tenth yeere of his owne life begot Vri, when Caleb was twenty one yeeres old: and Vri in his ninth begat Bezaleel, Caleb then being thirty, and Bezaleelten, when hee began to frame the Tabernacle; at which time Caleb was forty yeeres old.
                     
                     
                        
But how many ouersights are in these his sayings, is soone perceiued: first, that Caleb should haue (not a The Rabbins opinion confuted. child, but) children, as hee is said to haue by Azuba, 1. Chron. 2. 18. he being but eight yeeres old, is vncredible: secondly, that Azuba should be a mother of children, she dying the first yeere of her marriage, vnlesse they were twinnes, which is not apparant, is vnpossible: thirdly, that Caleb, aged but nine, should take to wife Miriam the sister of Moses, she being about nintie, is not agreeable: for shee was elder then Moses, and of discretion to call her mother for his nurse, when the 
                           Her name was Thermuthis, saith Iosephus. Ant. lib. 2. ca. 5. daughter of Pharaoh found him in the Arke of Bull-rushes; since when, we know fourescore and one yeeres to bee fully expired. To make her then a mother at ninty, and to beare a Sonne in that age of her life, is so vnlikely, that Ioseph. Anti. lib. 2 cap. 2. 
                        Iosephus will haue her not to be the mother of Hur, but the wife of Hur, and mother vnto Vri, his son, which is far more probable, their yeres agreeable, & fit for marriage.
                     
                        
For Hur was in the same degree 
                           Miriam the wife, and not th
                              •…
                            mother of Hur.
                         from Hezron of Iudah, who went with Iacob into Egypt, as Miriam was from Kohath of Leui, one of the seuenty that descended also: for Kohath begot Amram, and Amram, Miriam; so Hezron begot Caleb, and Caleb, Hur.
                     
                     Fourthly, that Hur and Vri should bee either of them Fathers at tenne yeeres of age, is vnexemplified in Scripture, though Genebrard allow, that Haran might bee father vnto Sara at eight.
                     And lastly, that Bezaleel should haue the aduantage of Christ by two yeeres, to be as skilfull at ten in the worke of the Tabernacle; as Luke 2. 46. 
                        Christ was at twelue to build the true Temple, when with admiration hee opposed the Doctors, and expounded the Law.
                     
                     These impossibilities therefore our ancient Lyra well perceiued, but in seeking to redresse them, hee fell into as great an error himselfe; in saying, that these men, Hur, Vri, and Bezaleel, mentioned in the first of

                        Chronicles, chap. 2. 20. were not the same that were spoken of in Exod. chap. 31. but Lyra herein not to be followed. were other men of the same name, & of the same tribe. But so to expound the text, is dangerous, lest a liking liberty loose thereby the ioynts of the holy scriptures frame, and to giue the water that passage, the breach will bee great.
                     
                        Vatab. Anotat. vpon 1. Chr. 4. 15. 
                        Vatablus in his annotations, and Cumanus Flinspach in his Arca Dei, doe take Hezron to be Iephunneh, & so consequently, the first Caleb the sonne of Hezron, to be the same Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh, and the great Grand-father vnto Bezaleel. But therein then must bee followed all Rabbi Solomoh his errours, for Calebs forty yeres age wil inforce it so.
                     But that Hezron could bee either Iephunneh, or the Father of Caleb the Lands-surueyour, is by the text manifestly contradicted: for Hezron was borne vnto Phares before that Iacob went downe into Egypt; and in Egypt, Hezron begot his sonne the first Caleb, when he was threescore yeers

of age, as 1. Chron. 2. 21. by which account, The first Caleb could not be the Lands searcher. that Caleb must needes haue been an hundred fiftie fiue yeeres old in the first yeere of the wildernesse: for in Egypt the abode was two hundred and fifteene, as before we haue shewed. But 1. Chron. 2. 18. 
                        Caleb, the sonne of Iephunneh, the lands-searcher, was then but Iosh. 14. 7 
                        forty yeeres old; wherby it is euident, these Calebs could not be one and the same, but two seuerall men.
                     Now as it is impossible for the first Caleb, the great Grand-father vnto Bezaleel, to be the lands-searcher; so the last Caleb being the seuenth in descent from him, and the fifth in degree after Bezaleel, ministreth matter of much seeming difficultie; for that both of them at one time were imployed in most serious affaires.
                     As touching Calebs successors, I know there are many doubts made, Tostatus. some making but two Calebs, some three, and some foure: and the first and last, hauing either of them a daughter called A
                              •…
                           hsah, doth no whit lessen the doubt.
                     
                        
Again, whether Ezer mentioned in this pedegree, was the immediat son Doubts made in the pedegree of Hezron.
                         of the second Caleb, or the immediat father vnto the third, may seeme doubtfull: As also Kenaz hauing no such pregnant testimony, either of predecessor, or successor, as may inforce (it may be obiected) there is no certaine descents betwixt the Lands searcher, and the equalising of the skilfull workman Bezaleel.
                     
                     To which may be answered, that although Ezer bee not so precisely Doubts answered in the pedegeee of Hezron. 1. Chron. 4. 4. named a sonne, as some others are, yet is he said to bee of the sonnes of Hur, in the first of the Chronicles, the fourth Chapter, and the fourth verse, and neerer to him by any of his sonnes he cannot bee, then of Caleb, who was his eldest sonne, as verse fiftie: so that the many descents, in so short a time, will warrant him to be Calebs sonne.
                     And for the other obiection of doubt, thus I answere: If the Kene▪ zite, Numb. 32. vers. 12. be not the immediate sonne of Caleb, and the immediate father vnto Iephuneh,
                        
then more of his families must come betwixt, and so the last Caleb should be further remooued from Bezaleel, and a more impossibilitie imagined.
                     But to vnloose this seeming hard knot, and to approue the truth of a continued succession, let it be allowed to suppose the ages of these men when they were fathers, and especially of him vpon whom resteth the greatestdoubt; so shall wee force neither breach of successiō, nor find such impossibilities as haue bin alleaged.
                     Admit then Hur to bee twentie yeeres old when he begot Caleb, and Caleb twenty when he begot Ezer; Ezer twenty when he begot Caleb, Caleb twenty when he begot Kenaz, Kenaz twenty when he begot Iephuneh; Iephuneh twenty when he begot Caleb; and Caleb we know was Iosh. 14 7 forty, when hee searched the land; all which yeeres being added together, make one hundred and sixty.
                     Returne to Hur in his other issue, and admit Hur to be seuentie when he begot Vri, Vri to be sixtie when when he begot Bezaleel, and Bezaleel
                        
thirty when hee wrought vpon the Tabernacle: which yeeres likewise being summed together, come also to one hundred and sixty.
                     Thus then you see this rough way made smooth, and nature no whit How Caleb and Bezaleel were men in one age. forced in neither line; for that sons were begotten both at younger, and elder yeeres through many descents in those times, as we haue alreadie seene. And that Bezaleel should bee thirtie, is most agreeable to the Law of the Leuites, who at Num. 4. 3 thirtie were chosen for seruices in the Tabernacle; and therefore most likely that at those yeeres hee was chosen to worke in the Tabernacle.
                     
                     Now seeing wee haue the true Hob. 8. 2 
                        Tabernacle which is not made with hands, and are heires of that Canaan whose rest is perpetuall; let vs study to enter therein, and with thanks offer our sacrifices vnto him who is the first, and the last, in euery leafe and line of the Law. For 
                        Rom. 11. 36. 
                        of him, and through him, and for him, are all things that are written, to whom be all glory for euer. Amen.

                        That God became Man, and from what men descended, the Scriptures Genealogies doe euidently shew.
                     
                     
                        IT resteth now to shew, that through these holy

                        Genealogies, GOD became Man, and that Christ (the word before all things) was in mans loynes inclosed, till the Galat. 4. 4. 
                        fulnesse of time came, that God sent his Sonne to bee made of a Woman.
                     
                     This blessed fruit therefore in whom our election was sealed, Eph. 1. 4. 
                        before the foundation of the world, was first promised to our first parents in Paradise, after their taste of the forbidden fruit of death, when likewise the Serpents malice was quailed by this sentence, 
                           Gen 3. Was promised to the fathers. 
                        I wil put enmity between thee and the woman, and betweene thy seed and her seed. He shall breake thine head, and thou shalt bruse his heele. And

that this her seed then promised, was the very Messiah to come, both Iewes and Gentiles haue acknowledged, the

                           athers looked for, and the Patriarkes beleeued in.
                     The Scriptures thus beginning Reueiled in the Scriptures. with a Messiah, the onely Alpha of al our happinesse, aimeth at no other marke besides him, the onely Omega of all our hopes. For leauing the state-affaires of the world, as the breeding of Kingdomes, Principalities, and the like, they directly leade vs to the birth and of-spring of Abraham, whereof Christ was to bee borne: and vnto him eight seuerall times was promise made, that in his seed all the nations of the earth should bee blessed And vnto Isaac his sonne the same promise was confirmed in the same words.
                     Vnto Iacob he was the Num. 24 17. 19.

                        the corner stone tried and precious. These and infinite more promises of the Messiah, are most frequent in the Scriptures of God, which were all accomplished in Christ the Immanuel with vs, whose naturall fathers were as great a cloud, and as many witnesses Being innūber. 74. Luk. 10. 1. to shew the truth of his humanity, as were the Euangelists & Disciples that wrote, and were sent to preach his Deity, being fitted forthat worke, as was the golden crownework vpon the edges of the incense Alter, and leade our paths into that way of truth, as the fiery Pillar did light the Israelites remouings.
                     But our ouer-much negligence in these holy Genealogies, as also in the Ignorance in the sacred Genealogies, hath hurt the cause of Christianity double discents legall and naturall; of Iesus our Lord and Messiah, hath greatly hurt both our owne cause, and hindered the Iewes from embracing the Gospell.
                     
                        
Our hurt in bringing him naturally from Salomon, whose line was ended long before: their hinderance by our entangling the text of the old Testament in Ioash, and Ieconiah, and in the new, in Iacob, Ioseph, and Eli; whereby they daily obiect, that we are not able by Scriptures to reconcile our owne Euangelists, Saint Mathew and Saint Luke.
                     
                     That he is of Dauid, both they and we agree, but whether by Salomon or Wherein the Iewes and Christians differ touching Christs nature, & his right to the Kingdome. 
                        Nathan resteth the question. They hold him from Salomon by birth and naturall succession: wee naturally from Nathan, & by a legall right, the next heire to Salomons Kingdom, his own posterity being vtterly extinct.

                        Eusebius likewise, citing the Epistle Africanus ad Aristidē Epistola. of Africanus to Aristides, as ancient as Origin, in these descents of Christ his parents, both by legall mariages, and in double venters of sons, Inuentions trouble the truth. so troubleth the truth with vnwarrantable

inuentions, as may dazell the eies of the best sighted searcher; his words somewhat abridged, I will here insert.
                     
                        The 
                        Eus Eccl hist. l. 1. c. 8 
                        kindred (saith he) of Salomon and of Nathan is so knit together, by reuiuing of the deceased without issue, by second mariages by raising of seede, so that not without cause, the same persons are posted ouer to diuers fathers, whereof some were imagined, and some others were their fathers indeed, both the allegations being properly true, though in Ioseph diuersly, yet exactly by descent determined. And that that which I go about to proue, may plainely appeare, I will declare the orderly succession of this Genealogie, making a recitall from Dauid to Salomon. The third from the end is Matthan Math 1. Luke 3. 
                        found, which begat Iacob, the father of Ioseph, but from Nathan the son of Dauid, decending according to the Gospell of Luke, the third from the ende is Melchi, whose sonne is Hely, the father of Ioseph. For Ioseph is the son of Hely, the sonne of Melchi. Ioseph being the proposed marke to shoote at, wee must shew how either is termed his father
                        
deriuing the pedegree of Iacob from Salomon, of Heli from Nathan. And first how Iacob and Heli, being two brethren, then their fathers, Matthan and Melchi, borne of diuers kindreds, may be prooued grandfathers to Ioseph. Matthan therefore and Melchi, marrying the same wife, begat brethren by the same mother, the law not forbidding a Widow either dismissed from her Husband, or after the death of her husband, to be coupelled vnto another man. First, therefore, Not so, for Salomon hath none of his race so named, & Mutthā
                            was of Abiud, as Melchi also was, and both of thē of Zorobabell from Nathan.
                         
                        Matthan descending from Salomon, begat Iacob of Estha, for that is said to be her name. After the death of Matthan, Melchi (which is said to haue descended from Nathan) beeing of the same Tribe, but of another race, hauing maried this widow to his wife, begat Hely his sonne. Thus doe wee finde Iacob and Heli of a different race, but by the same mother to haue bin brethren. Of the which, Iacob taking to wife his sister the wife of Heli, his brother beeing deceased without issue, begat on her the third, to wit, Ioseph: by nature and the order of generation vnto himselfe, whereupon it is written, Iacob begat Ioseph,
                        
by the law vnto his brother Heli deceased, whose sonne Ioseph was. For Iacob being his brother, raised seede vnto him: wherefore, neither that Genealogie which concerneth him, is to be abolished, the which Mathew the Auangelist reciting; Iacob (saith he) begat Ioseph: and Luke of the other side; which was the sonne (saith he) as it was supposed (adding this withall) of Ioseph, which was the sonne of Heli, which was the sonne of Melchi. And the word of begetting hee ouer skipped with silence vnto the end, with such a recitall of sonnes, making relation vnto Adam, which was of God: nor is this hard to proue, or to small purpose proposed.
                     In this tedious speech of Eusebius, you may see how Ioseph is forced to bee naturally from Salomon, and adoptiuely from Nathan, but by imagined fathers, as himselfe confesseth. and Mary, whose parentage concerneth Christs humanity most, not once spoken of in this Epistle: how weake a reconciliation therefore is made of our holy Euangelists, let the vnsatisfied Christian iudge; and yet

in these fainings, he hath beene followed In the Bibles of the largest vollume in English. in the labours of those that otherwise haue done wel; which their pedegrees to shew the present defect, is here from them presented to thy sight.
                     
                     
                        
In this intricate Labirinth who can but lament; where neither Scripture is followed, nor propagation allowed: and how farre from truth Eusebius hath straied in this his pretended reconciliation, is euidently seene; namely, in making Melchi to be the immediat father of Heli, and the third from the end in S. Contrarieties. 
                        Lukes catalogue; when by the said Euangelist it is most apparant that he was the fifth from the end; and not the father, but the great grandfather of Heli: for Melchi begat Leui, and Leui begat Matthat, and Matthat begat Heli, whose sonne in law Ioseph was.
                     Then could not Melchi be the naturall and next immediate father of Heli, two generations comming betwixt, howsoeuer Eusebius vnderstandeth his ranke from the end.
                     Nor could the issues of double mariages so begot and borne, bee brothers of one venter, twines: as Iacob and Heli are said to bee by the A Conceit without example. said Estha, and by two seuerall men, Matthan and Melchi; a thing strange

in nature, and the like in Scripture neuer seene.
                     And though Lyra from Africanus and Hierome allow of the double mariages, for the raysing of seed to the issulesse deceased, yet he ioyneth Matthat and not Melchi vnto Estha, for her second husband, and maketh Heli her sonne by the same man.
                     But in following these Rabbins too neerely, that bring Christ from Salomon: Nicolas Lyra in his annotations both vpon the first booke of Chronicles, and the Gospell of Saint Mathew, ouerrunneth the truth into a most dangerous error.
                     For he would haue Nathan to bee but the adopted sonne of Dauid, and the naturall sonne of Vriah the Hittite, borne vnto him by Bathsheba his wife, before Dauid tooke her for his. For vpon Dauids sonnes borne in Ierusalem, and 1 Chro. 3. 5. thus he commenteth. Onely Salomon was Dauids 
                        
                           Lyra annotation vpon 1 Chr. 3. 5 & in Mat. 1. 
                        naturall sonne, the other three were Vriahs, whom Dauid made his by adoption. So our Lord should come, and take flesh, not of blessed Sem, and beloued

                        Dauid, as by the Prophets was promised; but of cursed Cham, and irreligious Heth, without all warrant of the sacred Text.
                     But vnto these their assertions, let vs assay further the answer, to cleere our Euangelists from the least touch of disagreement.
                     First then, though Lucidus bee greatly deceiued in the ending of Salomons line in Ahaziah, yet touching The opinions examined, with their resolutions. 
                        Nathans right and families, he hath spoken well, in bringing Ioseph, Mary, Zorobabel, and Salathiel, from Nathan, and Nathans issue to be successours vnto Salomons Crowne.
                     
                     But in following his forged Philo, he erreth exceedingly, in saving Iohn Luci dus deceiued by a forged Philo. that the Kings of Iudah, recorded by S. Mathew, are the same men whom Saint Luke recorded by other names. But that Kings should lose the Maiesty of their names knowne at their coronation, and afterward be called by other names of their inferiour subiects, no necessity constraining, as Lucidus affirmeth twelue of Iudahs Kings to haue done, is not againe exemplified

in the world, and is so far from credit, that neither Turke nor Iew will belieue the Texts of the old Testament are so to be vnderstood.
                     But to encrease the error, he goeth further, and endeth Salomons line in Ahaziah or Ochoziah, without any apparāt shew of truth: For hardly shall be found in Scripture a sonne oftner named from his father then 
                           Ioash in euery text where he is named, is called the sonne of Ochozias. Salomons house did not end in Ochozias.
                         
                        Ioash is from Ahaziah, as these sixe seuerall Texts approue. 2 Kings 11. 2 2 Kings 13. 1. 2 Kings 14. 13. 1 Chro. 3. 11. 2 Chro. 22. 11. 2 Chro. 23. 3.
                     The dissolution then of Salomons house was not at Ahaziah, in the seuenth generation, as Philo and his followers dreame, but continued vnto the eighteenth, to Ieconiah the childlesse, as the Prophet pronounceth him, whose pedegree from Salomon to himselfe, both in the bookes of the Kings, and also of the Chronicles is apparantly laid downe.
                     Neither hath any Iew the most diligent searchers of the Kingly line, ended that of Salomons, in the said Ahaziah: but rather haue assaied

to continue it long after the birth of Iesus, lest our Christ should be their King.
                     That Salomon sinned, we know by his story, & that his successours were wicked, we see by their acts, but that God wil bring his house sosoone to a period, is not manifested either Gods property is to warne before he doth strike. by speech or by prophecy. And the property of God is, to warne the punishment before he doth strike: for so saith Amos; 
                        Amos 3. 7. 
                        the Lord will doe nothing, but he reuealeth his secret vnto his seruants the Prophets. But where was heard the sound of that threat, that Salomons issue in Ahaziah should end; and the glory of his kingdome should be giuen to Simeon, a poore subiect, and of another family?
                     And why should it end in Ahaziah, rather then in Ioram his father, who sought the vtter destruction thereof, by murthering his sixe brethren, 2. Chro. 21. 4. all the sonnes of Iehoshaphat King of Iudah: & many other Princes of Israell, and was himselfe so diseased in his bowels, as to mans seeming his naturall fecundity was

altogether hindered.
                     Againe, this is a generall obseruation, that when God for sinne taketh Gods manner of dealings. his blessings from the offender, hee doth bestow them vpon the more worthy, as hee did the birthright from prophane Gen. 27. 
                        Esau, & gaue it to Iacob that preuailed with God: when he reiected disobedient 1. Sam. 15. 28.

                     But in this change of state and of persons, we find no such differences: For Ioash, whom they faine from Nathan, continued the like wickednes, as they from Salomon had done; and with Cain is compared in shedding (as he had Abels)

And this is a rule of foundation, that Israell shall haue no King but of the house of Dauid, and of the seede of Salomon; and who so maketh a schisme touching that family, denieth God, euen the blessed God, and the words of his Prophets.
                     
                     And vpon this opinion of rule and gouernment, Christians also haue been ouermuch affectionated, when they bring Christ naturally from those Kings that gouerned of Salomons

                        I was my Fathers sonne, tender and only beloued in the sight of my Mother: which thing I take was rather spoken of Salomons election to the kingdome, whom God had chosen, and Dauid to Bersheba had 1 Kin. 1. 29. sworne, that Salomon her Sonne should succeed him in the
                     
                     
                        
                        Lyra thus infected with malitious Iewes studies, and partly following Christians that brought Christ from Salomon, held the Iewish Article touching the Crowne: but otherwise in most of his paines spent in commenting vpon al the bookes of both Testaments, he was an excellent Organe, sounding alowd the verity of Lyra commended.

                     But that Christ should come from Dauid by Nathan, and his obscure successors, whereof neuer any bare rule, but onely Zerubbabel, and he no longer then the Temple was in building, he could not conceiue: neither that Ieconiah should beget Salathiel, but for his successor, seeing he is called his 1.

I cal them intricate, for that Iacob and Eli are made brethren, and 
                        In a Table once printed with the great Bible. 
                        twinnes of one venter by Estha, wife vnto Matthan of Salomon, and vnto Melchi of Nathan: and those halfe brethren likewise marying one woman, Iacob by her is said to raise vp seede vnto Eli deceased, whereby Ioseph was sonne vnto both.
                     A strang inuention truly, to bring Ioseph from Ieconiah and Salomon; who with lesse paines, and more truth, might haue beene found from Zerubbabel, Neri, and Nathan: and stranger it seemeth, that such search should be made, to shew how Christ
                        
by nature is the sonne of Dauid: and yet neuer to make knowne his naturall Parents from Dauid: neither can I perceiue what necessity constraineth Ioseph to bee the proposed marke of 
                        
                           Ioseph can be no proposed mark for Christs humanity, seeing hee tooke not flesh of him 
                        that aime, seeing he is but the supposed father of Christ, vnto whom (excepting his title to the kingdome) his humanity no whit appertaineth.
                     Either to bring Iosephs naturall decent from Salomon, and his legal from Nathan, seeing he enioyed no possessions appertaining to Salomons Crowne, nor Mary his wife an inheritrix of any patrimony in Iudea. For which end only, that law of marying the brothers wife was ordained, and at this aimed, that no Deu: 25. 5, 6. family should be extinguished in Israell.
                     
                     It was the case of the 
                           Num. 27 Iptahs daughter not burned in sacrifice, but made a Vestall.

side onely, no such law was either ordained, No law for brethren only, by the mother to inherit. Baba Batra.
                         or practised; for the son by the man, and not by the woman, euer succeeded in the inheritance, and in the name of the family (excepting such as inherited by the line of the mother, as 1. Chron. 2. 22. 
                        Iair did twenty two cities in Gilead), and therefore Iacobs sonne by that law could not be the sonne of Eli.
                     
                     Howsoeuer▪ then Eusebius fauoureth that reconciliation, and wisheth others to preferre the same for the agreement of our Euangelists, yet seeing it standeth vpon no firmer ground than that himselfe hath built vpon, we may without preiudice mistrust the foundation. For (saith he) Euseb. Eccles. hist. lib. 1. ca. 8. Herod burned the Jewes records.
                         Herod the sonne of Antipater, pricked in mind for the basenesse of his birth, burned the ancient Records of the Iewes Genealogies, supposing thereby to deriue himselfe of noble parentage. But certaine men of the affinitie and kindred of our Sauiour trauelling from Nazarites and Cochoba (castles of the Iewes) into other Regions, expounded the foresaid Genealogies out of books of Chronicles, as farre as they extended.

                        There was a Maide (saith hee) in Bethlem of Iuda, whose name was Mary, the daughter of Heli, of the kinred of Zerubbabel, the sonne of Salathiel, of the tribe of Iuda, who was betrothed to Ioseph of the same kinred and tribe. Where by him we see, that the virgin Mary was the daughter of Eli, and by her Ioseph is his sonne; and not by a second marriage, or seede raised to the deceased, but rather by the law of matrimony, as Exo. 3. 1. 
                        Moses of Leui, was the sonne of Iethro the Madianite, and 1. Sam. 24. 17.

                        In the Temple of Ierusalem (quoth the Iew) therewere two and twenty ordinarie Priests: and as soone as any of them died, the residue chose another in his place. Now it hapned that IESVS for his singular godlinesse and doctrine, was chosen by them: and to the intent they might know the name of his father and mother, and inregister it according to the custome, they sent for them; and Mary came thither alone, because her husband Ioseph was then dead. And shee being asked the name of the father of Iesus, answered vpon her oath, that she had conceiued him by the holy Ghost, and reported to them the words of the Angell. Moreouer, shee told them the names of the women that came to her labour vnlooked for: and vpon due inquisition thereof, when all things were found to fall out true, they registred his name in the Register of the Priests in

                     By which, and others their owne testimonies, is euident how Ioseph was the sonne of Eli, by the mariage of his daughter; and how Iesus was the sonne of Ioseph by the marriage of his mother: both which were according to the law, and not by any naturall descent.

But that Marie therefore should be of Leui, it prooueth hot.
                     For albeit that daughters which Why the law of marrying into their owne tribes was ordained. were inheriters, were to bestow themselues vpon men of the same Tribes, lest their Numb. 36. 8.

                        Leuite must offer the Sacrifice. 2. But any of Israel might expound the law. 3. The expounder must be an eminent man, and of great estimation. 4. He that expounded, might not leane vpon any pillar, deske, or board. 5. Neither must any reade, vntill the Master of the Sinagogue had commanded him. 6. He that was to reade, was to open the booke, to reade the text, and to roule vp the booke againe. These obseruances done, the people with silence attended the exposition; vpon which customes doubtlesse, Saint

                        Iames spake, when hee said, Acts 15. 21. that Moses of old time had in euery city them that preached him, being read in the Sinagogue euery Sabbath day. And according to that custome Saint Luke recordeth the actions of our Sauiour in these words:
                     
                        Luke 4. 16. 
                        And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought vp, and as his custome was he went into the Sinagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood vp for to reade. And there was deliuered vnto him the booke of the Prophet Esaias: and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written: The Spirit of the Lord is vpon me, because hee hath annointed me to preach the Gospell to the poore, he hath sent me to heale the broken hearted, to preach deliuerance to the captiues, and recouering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are brused. To preach the acceptable yeere of the Lord. And he closed the booke, and he gaue it againe to the Minister, and sate downe: and the

                           yes of all them that were in the Sinagogue were fastned on him. And he began to say vnto them; This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your eares. And all
                        
                        bare him witnesse, and wondred at the gracio

                     Note here how many things of the Hebrewes traditions our Lord then obserued; he stood vp to reade; the booke was deliuered to him; he opened the booke, and found the place; hee closed the book; and the eyes of all that were in the Sinagogue 
                        Christ according to the Canons, read in the Synagogue, as any Israelite might reade. were fastned on him. Thus wee see by many circumstances that our Lord read, as any of Israel might, as well as Leui. So Paul and Barnabas, the one doubtlesse of Beniamin, though the other were of Leui, both at Antioch, and neither of them knowne for Apostolike calling, were desired by the Acts 13. 15. 
                        Rulers of the Synagogue to speake words of exhortation after the reading of the Law.
                     
                     If Suidas then had obserued this text, or had knowne this practise in the Iewes Sinagogue, he would neuer haue thought that a man by the line of his mother, might bee accounted a Leuite, or by that right, vse the function

of that glorious Kingdome, which whilst it stood, was the glory of the earth, and a figure of the Celestiall that is to come. The want of issue then which failed in Ieconiah, was the Rod of Salomons line, wherewith God scourged him and his Kingdome: and how that fell out, let vs see the seuerall rents that therein were made.
                     The first rent of Salomons Kingdome, may bee said to beginne in his owne life time, when Ahijah the Shilonite rent the new garment that 1. Kings 12. 30.

                     But the last and greatest rent of Salomons Kingdome was, when the earth was commanded to take knowledge, that his successour and sonne Ieconiah should die childlesse, and that none of his seede should sit vpon Salomons Throne any more, as by Ieremy was proclaimed, and to Iechoniah told: I wil giue thee (saith he) Ier. 22. 25.

                        Thrice is the earth named, to warne attention that Ieconiah should die childlesse. 
                        O Earth, Earth, Earth, heare the word of the Lord; thus saith the Lord, write this man childlesse, a man that shall not prosper in his dayes: for no man of his seede shall prosper, to sit vpon the Throne of Dauid, or to beare rule any more in Iudah.
                     Of whose successor, Crowne, and Kingdome, the Prophet Ezechiel further speaketh, when Nebuchad nezzar (after he had captiuated Ie coniah in Babylon) had set his Vncle Zedekiah vpon Iudahs throne. Ezech. 21. 25.

                        Thrice is proclaimed the ouerturning of Salomons Crowne, & reuersing it to another family. 
                        God, I will take away the Diademe, and take off the Crowne: this shall be no more the same: I will exalt the humble, and will abase him that is hie. I will ouerturne, ouerturne, ouerturne it, and it shall be no more, vntill hee come whose right

In his dayes Iudah shall be saued, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is the name whereby he shall be called; THE LORD OVR RIGHTEOVSNESSE.

fighteth against Manasses, and Manasses against Ephraim: for this was a principall point held of the Rabbin against Rabbin. ancient Rabbins, that repentance could not put back a decree made with an oath. And the Babylonian Thalmud in Sanedrim, expoundeth Assir for an adiectiue bound vp, or hard kept, restraint or prisoner, and not for the proper name of a man. Moreouer, their Sedar olam zuta, affirmeth, that it was but the Rabbins report, that Salathiel was the naturall sonne of Ieconiah. And Kimchi, with Salomoh Iarchi, vpon the twelfth of Zacharie, confesse, that Nathan there named, was the sonne of Dauid, who should not haue been mentioned as a principal man to Zerubbabel, vnlesse he were of his family.
                     But as touching, that it could not put backe a decree made by oath; Did that of Zedekiah, and them that were carried away with him, make them the Ier. 24. 8.

                        Noah, Daniel and Iob, should not be heard against Gods decree, of famine, pestilence and sword, shall wee thinke that Ieconiah (whose repentance is not read of, and whose captiuitie remained thirty seuen yeeres in Babylon, euen all his life long) could alter Gods oath, as touching posteritie? And yet these miserable God altereth not his oath. men seeke to continue a succession from this childlesse man.

For he maketh Ioram to beget Ozias, whereas the Chronicles tels vs, that Ozias was the immediat sonne of Amaziah, and was foure descents after Ioram, his great Grandfather, who died 69. yeeres before Ozias was borne.
                     So likewise he saith, that Iosias begat Ieconias; who notwithstanding was his Grand-child, and sonne vnto Iehoiakim, the second sonne of Iosiah.

                     And that the Euangelist spake of the heires of the Crowne, and not of the kindreds in bloud, it further appeareth, in that he ascendeth by the S.

                     And how from Adam (to omit the other collaterals, that in another kind leade vnto Christ) let vs here insert, that so the whole generations of his Manhood may fully appeare: so carefully recorded in all former ages by the holy Ghost himselfe: and in the later time continued

                        successor, and in that sense is hee called his sonne, who was by nature the sonne of Neri, as Saint Luke in recording the naturall line hath laid downe.
                     
                        Salathiel thus made a sonne in succession, his owne successor likewise is said to be his sonne: which was Zerubbabel his grand-child, the sonne of Pedaiah, as 1. Chron. 3. 19.

                        is silent from Abiud to Ioseph, either for names or actions: onely the bookes of the Macchabees are some stay for stories of those times.

Saint Mathew recording the heires of Iudahs Crowne, ascendeth, as is said, no higher then Abraham, vnto whom the first promise either of King or Kingdome was giuen: for when God meant to make him the glory of men, and had Gen. 17. 8. called him from Vr of the Chaldeans, had shewed and giuen him the Land of Canaan, this further he assured, that his Seede should be in number to the 
                        Gen. 15. 5

                        of the earth: and that Kings should proceede out of his loynes, & Sara his wife should bee a mother to kings of people. Now, as in Rom 9. 7 
                        Isaac the seede was called, so in Gen. 49. 10. 
                        Iudah the Scepter was established, which whilst it stood vpright with God, was the glory of the Earth, and their Temple the very gate of Heauen.

                        flesh, and dwelt among vs, & we saw the glory thereof, as the glory of the onely begotten Sonne of the Father, full of grace and truth.
                     
                     This Sonne of God, Saint Lukes pen sheweth to be Iesus, the Seed promised in Paradise▪
                         to the espoused Virgin Eua, and borne at Beth-lehem of the betrothed virgin Mary, according to the Prophets, recording betweeene them, all his naturall Fathers, from Eli to Adam, whom he calleth the Sonne of God. By which tearme Son, through them all, he proueth that Iesus was the Christ of whom Moses wrote, and the Prophets spake.
                     The purposes therefore of the The reconciliation of S. Matthew & S. Luke
                         two Euangelists being thus obserued, their reconciliation is easie; namely, that Saint Matthew, following the right that Iesus had by law vnto Salomons Crowne, recordeth his title therunto from such Kings and persons, as (excepting his legall right of succession) he in no wise tooke flesh of, or by nature came: and in that sense of Succession, bringeth Christ to bee the sonne of Salomon. But Saint Luke,

                     Saint Matthew by a legall right, bringeth Christ from twelue as wicked Kings as the Earth bare, when they ware Iudahs Crown. But Saint Luke, by his naturall parentage, deriueth him from the Esay 6. 13.

                     Saint Matthew, in his legall right of Succession, bringeth Christ from Ieconiah, that neuer had child, nor any of his seed euer sate vpon Iudahs Throne. But Saint Luke, by his Natural fathers deriueth him from Zorobabell, made the Ruler of Iudah, and Signet vpon Gods finger.

                        of Zorobabell, who ioyning in mariage Of Zorobabel

                        That Christ Iesus, by his naturall descent, was the onely imediate, and lawfull King of the Iewes, and that none other had any claime or title thereunto.
                     
                     
                        HAuing thus by Gods most gracious assistance, shewed Christ Iesus to bee the true sonne of Dauid, and from the Euangelists declared his parentage, naturall and in common reputation; it remaineth now to proue, that the same Iesus, the sonne of the Uirgine, both from Ioseph, and Mary, was the only heire of Dauids terrestiall kingdom

of Canaan: and in that right, is euer called King of the Iewes: to manifest which, shall be obserued:
                     First, That it was an earthly kingdome that was promised to Abraham, and by his seed possessed.
                     Secondly, That the generall expectation of the Iewes, was set vpon a terrestiall, and powerfull King and Kingdome.
                     
                     Thridly, That none other by any descent, kindred or estate, had any right, title▪ or claime to the kingdome of Iudah.
                     
                     Fourthly, That Christ Iesus alone, and none but hee, was the lawfull King of the Iewes, the seed and sonne of Dauid that sits vpon his Throne, for euer. Prepare my heart O Lord, Psal. 45. to indite this good matter, and make my hand the pen of a readie writer, to proclaime that King which is fairer then the children of men.
                     For the first, That it was an earthly Kingdome, wee will begin with the promise made to Abraham, & lay that as the foundation of a terrestriall,

before wee build vpon the mysticall, as Salomon did the materials 1 King. 1. of his Temple, whose beauty was a figure of that which is to come.
                     The beginning then of this earthly kingdome, was, when God began to make Canaan a Kingdome, which was at his calling of Abraham from Mesopotamia, vnto the plaine of mount Moreh, where hee bad him lift vp his eies, and looke Northward and southward, eastward and westward, 
                        Gē. 13. 14. 
                        and to walke through the breadth and length of the land: All which hee would giue vnto him, and to his seed after him to inherit; with promise, that Kings from his loynes proceeding, should rule and possesse Gē. 17. 8. all the land, from the Riuer of Egypt vnto the great Riuer Euphrates. Here we see the foundation of a terestricall kingdome laid, whereof Abraham had the promise, and his seede after him the possession.
                     Of whose state and continuance, old Iacob prophecied, that the Scepter should not depart from Iudah, nor a

                     That by the Scepter is meant an earthly gouernment, or a regall authority, both the Septuagint, and the Chalde paraphrase doe auouch; and that Iesus Christ, was the Shiloh from the wombe of the Virgine, the Talm. Senad. in cap

                           lec. was taken cleane from them, and their Crowne worne by Herod an Idumean stranger.
                     Vntill which time, the line of the lawfull Kings of the Tribe of Iudah had beene exactly and distinctly recorded and kept. But in one generation following, were so confounded, scattered and shufled together among other Tribes, and the Tribes each amongst others so mixed, as to this day there is not a Iew knowne De Ples. in verit. Chist. Relig. cap. 29 in the world, that can distinctly shew of what tribe he is descended: And their faire Dominions with

such desolations ouerrunne, that all hope is lost of any recouery: and for the obedience prophecied vnto him, the preaching of the Gospell, hath gotten that through the world.
                     It was the faire land that Moses from mount Nebo did behold, that Deut. 32. 49. 
                        Ioshuah from mount Hermon, to mount Hor, did conquer; At first diuided among the twelue Tribes, and after established a kingdome vnder Saul, of whom the spirituall could not be intended, neither was it in him figured: And that kingdome possessed, and crowne worne by him, was taken from Beniamin, and giuen to Iudah; and in Dauid setled with promise, that a sonne out of his loynes should sit vpon the throne thereof, and should raigne King for euer and euer, which none euer did or could doe, but onely his Sonne Iesus, the Prince Messiah; to whom be praise for euer and euer: and that he alone is the heire vnto that right, is witnessed by the sacred Texts, and shall be our paines heere to declare.
                     
                        
First then, this terrestriall Kingdome was seated (as saith the Prophet Ezek. 5. 5.) in the midst of nations; & did containe the Prouinces of Iury, Samaria, and Gallely: the Land of Gilead also without Iordan, was a portion of the twelue Tribes. The Num. 32. 1 whole so rich in earthly blessings, as it is often in Scriptures called, A Land flowing with milke and hony: and so pleasant for situation, as of some it is held, to haue been Adams Paradise.
                     
                     And as the Kingdome was glorious, so were many of her Kings, such were Dauid, Salomon, Asa, Iohoshaphat, and others godly, that ruled well their owne, and ouer-ruled others; till their successors became godlesse, and prouoked the ruine of both; as when Nebuchadnezzer King of Babell captiuated the Land, and led away Ieconias prisoner, who was the last man that wore that glorious Crown. After whom, the Persians with-held it from Zorobabel, the most lawful heire thereof. And the Grecians and Syra-Grecians,
                        
from Abiud, and his successors, vnto Ioseph the husband of Mary.
                     
                     These being as foure beasts, tooke this earthly Kingdom, (for the heauenly Dan. 7. they could not) from those the high Saints of God, that should possesse a Kingdome for euer and euer, with such desolation of that goodly Land, till lastly the Romans made conquest of all, and placed the Idumean Herod vpon Iudahs throne, Gen. 49. where Iacobs prophecy had the full euent. And thus we see no temporall Crowne worne of any of Iudah from the captiuity of Babylon, till Christ Iesus with thornes was crowned, shewed, and acknowledged King of the Iewes; the abhomination of desolation, set in the holy place, and the place neuer called holy after Christs death.
                     And thus much of the earthly Kingdome promised to Abraham; and the first point: the second followeth.
                     That the expectation of the Iewes, was set vpon an earthly The 2. Obseruation. 
                        Kingdome, and powerfull King, wee

may see by the practise of the common multitude: who hauing fedde vpon the fiue barley Loues, and two small fishes, acknowledged Iesus to bee the Prophet expected, Ioh. 6. 14 but withall presently assaied to haue him their King.
                     Againe, when he told them, that the sonne of man was come to seeke Luk. 19. 10. and to saue that which was lost, their apprehension was of a temporall restauration of their down-cast estate. The expectation of the Iewes, set vpon an earthly Kingdome.
                     
                     And vpon that opinion the Apostles themselues as it seemeth were set, when they demanded whether Act. 1. 6. at that time Christ would restore the Kingdom of Israel. And againe, we trusted that it had been he, that Luk. 24. 21. should haue deliuered Israell.
                     
                     And to the same purpose were the answeres of the ignorant women of Samaria, 
                        Ioh. 4. touching the Messias; and the learned Nicodemus of Gallile 
                        Iohn 3. touching mans new birth, both of them aiming as we see only at outward things.
                     And indeed so generall was the

opinion of an earthly and powerful Monarchie, as that euen the common people expected it, and had a A prophecy of a potent king prophecy touching the same among them, which was, That a King out of Iury, should 
                        Sueton. in vit. Aug. 
                        rule the whole world
                     
                     Which so terrified the Romans (included in that prophecy) as that they denied aide to their supplicant Ptolomie King of Egypt, and so troubled The Romās durst not place a King in Egypt. the assembly of the elders in Ierusalem, that their high Priest Caiaphas, gaue counsell to kill Iesus, lest the Ioh. 11. 49. 
                        Romans should come and take away their Kingdome, which was none otherwise meant then of the temporall.
                     And a temporall King, and terrestriall kingdom it was, that Herod 
                        
                           Herod feared a temporall King. so feared and sought to retaine, when Christ 
                        Math. 2. was sought after, by the stile of King of the Iewes.
                     
                     And of that earthly kingdome likewise, Pilat gaue Iesus the Ioh 19. 19. title, though to the preiudice of Caesar his Emperour. Neither meant the Scribes and Pharisees more then of the temporall, when themselues expounded

                        Moses without all spirituall vse, the cheife Priests so ignorant, that they knew not whether the Baptisme of Iohn was from Heauen or of men 
                        Mat. 21. 25.: nor none of them, how Dauids sonne could be Dauids

                     Finally, all of them apply euery Text in the Prophets, touching the calling of the Gentiles, of Christ, and The Rabbins applications. his Kingdome, to be meant of a powerfull, terrestriall Monarch & Monarchie, and promise themselues conquests attendance, & pleasures, as in another earthly Paradise, all Nations yeelding them seruice and obedience. And now wee come to speake of Christ, his title vnto Iudahs Crowne; the third point.
                     
                        Iesus legally descending from The 3. Obseruation. 
                        Iechoniah, and lineally from Zorobabel, by his ancestor Salathiel, (who was made a sonne to a childlesse man) is borne the next in bloud and Iesus his right to the kingdome. succession, to sit vpon Dauids
                        
throne, and by that right is often Iesus his right to the Kingdome. called by each of the Euangelists, King of the Iewes.
                     
                     For the right of Zorobabel, resting in Ioseph the husband of Mary, and (he dying issulesse) in Mary her selfe; Christ Iesus their Sonne, then must bee heire vnto both, and by Father and Mother haue the iust title to Iudahs Crowne.
                     
                     That Ioseph then in his dayes, was the next successour to Salomons

                        Luk 2. 4 of the house and lineage of Dauid: vnto which Tribe and person, the Crown was intaled euen by God himselfe: neither was there any before him besides, or with him, that could be No competitor w

                        Iesus to bee his heire.
                     The opinion therefore of one Eusebius l. 5. cap. 8. 
                        Iraeneus and others, is not to be approued, Ieraen. lib. 3 cap. 25. who suppose that Ioseph had children of his owne body begot and wil haue Iames, and Ioses, Iudah, and Simon, to bee the naturall brethren of Christ, either by Father, or Mother, or both.
                     And Heluidius the Heretick, with the Ebionites, vrgeth that Iesus was not the onely sonne of Mary his Mother, because (saith hee) his brethren Mat. 13. 55. and sisters are so particularly named in the Euangelists.
                     
                     Others, from the words of the Apostle Saint Paul,

                     Vnto which conceit Eusebius

                        Mary Cleopas; for other Maries not to this purpose, of purpose we omit.
                     
                        Mary the Virgin and Mother of Christ, neither by Saint Mathew, nor by Saint Luke, hath her Parents expresly Why maries parents are not directly set down recorded. For the Euange lists setting downe the Lineage of our Sauiour, they doe not by the line of Mary from whom he tooke flesh, but from Ioseph, by whom hee was to deriue the Kingdome.
                     
                        
Therefore it is consequent that the Euangelists in that point, did principally intend to set forth our Sauiours Kingly right.
                     That so Christ might bee accounted from the man, and not from the woman, according to the vsuall manner of the Scriptures: for which cause, Ioseph is called the sonne both of Iacob his begetter, and of Eli her

                         father, by the mariage of her his daughter.
                     And that shee was the daughter of Eli, the Rabbins themselues doe acknowledge, and so tearme her; and doe bring her from Dauid, from Rab Hacanas the son of Nehumia.
                         
                        Iudah, and from the Towne Bethlehem, as the Euangelists haue done Ioseph her husband: neither haue wee The Rabbins proue what wee desire. Christians euer seene any contrary record, and so it must be.
                     For Christ could not truely be the seed of Dauid, vnlesse Mary (whose seede he was immediatly) were truely the seed of Dauid: But Christ was truely the seed of Dauid; therefore Mary (whose seed he was immediatly) was truly the seed of Dauid.
                     
                     
                        
This Mary then the daughter and sole heire of Eli her father, hath her fathers right in the title of Iudah, for so saith the Law, If a 
                        Num. 27

                        The Law maketh a woman capable of inheritance. in whom the right lay from Abiud the eldest of Zorobabels sonnes, after his decease, is also his heire.
                     For shee being descended from Rhesa, the younger brother, and Abiuds house failing in Ioseph her husband, 
                           Abiuds house ended

                     And Mary the neerest by any record, (though many descents passed betwixt) must be the only heire

                           Mary the virgin, daughter of Eli.
                         and this his daughter, a wife, and a virgin, was made most blessed in bearing of Christ.
                     
                        Annaes second husband was Salome, of whom, or from whence is

                        Cleopas, and so by consequence, shee should from her husband beare that surname: But whether from father or husband,

most certen it is, by the Euangelist Iohn, shee was the sister of Mary 
                        
                           Mary Cleopas, was sister to Mary the virgine. the Virgin, and that by the mother, and not by the father.
                     And that shee had either beene, or then was, the wife of Alpheus, S. Mary Cleopas was the wife of Alpheus.
                         
                        Mathew doth inferre, Chap. 10. 3. for Alpheus was the father, and she the mother of Mar. 15 40: 
                        Iames the lesse, as also of Ioses,. Math. 27. 56. vnto whom Iudah was brother; Luke 6. 16. and Simon is reckoned a brother among them: Mat. 13. 55.
                     But this Simon the sonne of this Mary, and Bishop of Ierusalem (saith Aegesippus. 
                        Aegesippus) was of the kindred & lineage of Dauid, for which and for his Christianity, hee was accused vnto Traian the Emperour, and patiently 
                           Simon Bishop of Ierusalem, saffred vnder Atticus.
                         suffered death vnder Atticus the Consull, as likewise many others of Iudahs Tribe for the same occasion of kindred vnder him, and other Emperours did, & had done. So as (it may be obiected) Iesus stood Obiect. not sole heire vnto Dauids Crown, but that this Simon, and others also were interested therein.
                     
                        
But thereunto may be answered, Answ. that albeit these and many others in those daies, also were of Iudahs Tribe, and Dauids kindred, yet that prooueth not they were of the children, either of Abiud or Rhesa, the sons of Zorobabel, from whō the right is deriued by both the Euangelists.
                     
                     Nor were these men Zebedee, and Zebede; Alpheus, Cleopas, vnknowne to be of Iudah. 
                        Alpheus, (the husbands of these Maries) nor Cleopas, whether husband or sonne, knowne to bee of Dauids line, or of Iudahs Tribe, by any apparancy of text: and therefore, neither themselues nor sonnes could be heires vnto Dauids throne, and Iudahs Kingdome.
                     But Christ being the sonne of the first borne Mary, and himselfe the Col. i. 15 first borne of euery Creature, is therefore before any of these Sons or parents in title to the Crowne; the law hauing established Deut. 21 17. the first borne to inherit.
                     For if in al things he was to haue the Col. i. 18 preheminēce, then most especially in that of Iudahs Crowne, it

being reserued for him, vnto Ezek. 21 27. whom it most rightfully belonged, and hee the onely rightfull heire vnto Dauid, as wee haue said.
                     Neither had Mary Cleopas, the mother of Iames, Ioses, Iudah and Simon, beene a former wife vnto Ioseph the Carpenter, as consequently shee must, had Ioseph been father to any of these her borne sons.
                     For it is euident, that shee liued after the death of Ioseph the Carpenter, for with Mary her Iohn 19. 25. sister she beheld Christ vpon the Crosse, wherby is most manifest, that with 
                           Mary Cleopas, could not be wife vnto Ioseph, her sister being aliue. 
                        Mary her sister shee could not haue beene a wife vnto Ioseph, nor Ioseph haue beene a iust man (as Saint Mathew records him) had hee enioyed two sisters at once, but rather a transgressour of the law which saith, Le. 18. 18 
                        Thou shalt not take a wife with her sister, during her life to vex her.
                     
                     And that Iames the lesse, the son of this Mary, was the sonne of Alpheus, 
                        
                           Iames the lesse, was not the naturall brother of Iesus. we haue shewed, and how hee and the rest were called the brethren of Iesus, wee may soone perceiue,

if wee consider that the vsuall custome of the Iewes was, to call not onely any of their kindred brethren, but them also of their Countrey and Tribe, as Moses, did the Act. 7. 26 
                        Striuers; and as they of 1. King. 12 24. 
                        Israell were brethren to them of Iudah: And in that sense did the Iewes call them the brethren of Iesus? when seeing his person, his wisedome, and workes, and knowing his parents, kindred, and education in the trade of a poore Carpenter, with great admiration they obiected and said, Mar. 6. 3. 
                        Whence hath hee this learning? is not this the Carpenter Maries sonne? the brother of Iames and Ioses, and Iudah and Simon? and are not his sisters here with vs?
                     
                     And Iames the lesse, being the son of Mary, who was the sister Ioh 19. 25. of Mary the Virgin, was then the Cosengerman (as we speake) vnto Iesus, euen his Ants sonne: and from that Iesus and Iames were Cosen-germans. his neere consanguinity, was called the Lords brother; and not from Ioseph by a former wife, as some haue imagined, nor any similituder

likenesse, that he had vnto Iesus, as Lyra saith, he was of, both in face * Lyr. annota vpon Gal. 1. 19. and lineaments of body.
                     But much more propperly was Iesus euer taken, and reputed to bee Iesus brought vp vnder Ioseph the space of twenty nine yeeres. the sonne of Ioseph, for that Ioseph was his bringer vp in the trade of a Carpenter, and his maintainer of liuelihood the space of twenty nine yeeres. And hauing no father vpon earth amonst men, but Ioseph the Carpenter, is therefore commonly called Mat. 13. 55. Ioh. 6. 42. the sonne of Ioseph the Carpenter.
                     And Ioseph likewise for the foresaid causes, is often reputed, and called the father of Iesus: and so 
                           Ioseph is commonly called the father of Iesus. doth Mary her selfe call him, when finding Iesus among the Doctors in the Temple disputing, shee said, Luk. 2. 46. 
                        Sonne, why hast thou thus dealt with vs, behold thy Father, and I haue sought thee sorrowing.
                     
                     And vpon the same ground that Ioseph had no issue of himselfe begot, is built the Perpetuitie of Maries

been subiect to the curse of barrennesse, had Ioseph euer knowne her as his wife.

                     Which title was acknowledged without any contradiction, & confirmed by the Priests and Scribes themselues, both in affirming the place of his birth, & in acknowledging his office, to be a Ruler in Israel.
                     
                     And the malicious Iewes to hinder his right to that kingdome, could name none, but Ioh. 19. 15. 
                        Caesar a stranger, and that contrary to their own law enioyned by Moses; which said, Deu. 17. 15.

                     And that Iesus was the acknowledged King of the Iewes, these speeches and demands of Pilat the Gouernour doth manifestly shew; Ioh. 19. 14.

                        Iesus acknowledged to bee king of the Iewes.

                     Yea, and the holy Ghost enforced his own wicked hand, to subscribe his most iust title thus: Ioh. 19. 15. 22. IESVS OF NAZARETH KING OF THE

IEVVES, which he wrote in Hebrew, 
                        
                           Pilat forced to testifie the truth. 
                        Greeke and Latine, that all might reade, and fixed it ouer his head vpon the Crosse, and that all might see, as himselfe had said, behold your King.
                     
                     And being admonished, by the Iewes States-men to alter the in scription, as too much derogatory vnto Caesars title, and no lesse then a matter of high treason in himself, answered: What I haue written, I

                        haue written, euen to the danger of his owne life.
                     And Christ himselfe that needeth no testimony of men, answered Pilat to his question, Ioh. 18. 37. 
                        Art thou a King? thou sayest that I am a King: To this end was I borne, and for this cause came I into the World, that I should beare witnesse vnto the truth, and euery one that is of the truth, heareth my voyce.
                     
                     And the same opinion of his kingly title after his resurrection, it seemeth the Iewes in Thessalonica had; when they accused Iason before the Rulers, that against the decree of Caesar, hee subborned them

that taught, there was no other King, euen one Iesus.
                     
                     Thus then we conclude, that this Iesus the Sonne of the Virgin, was the Act. 17. 7. expected King of the terrestriall Kingdome; the reall King without any Competitor to that Crowne. And the acknowledged King of the Iews; both by the Gentiles, and by the Iewes themselues.
                     But because in Dauid and in the rest, there was a figure of a Priestly or spirituall King and Kingdome, aswell as of a reall and earthly. Some haue thought, the figured only (and not the real) did belong vnto Christ, for that himselfe disclaimed all regall authority vpon earth.
                     But if we well consider that he alone is the Apo.

                        Foxes had holes, and the birds nests, but the Sonne of man, no place to lay his head.
                     
                     
                        
And in the short passage of his kingly triumph, when with concourse he was followed, and with shouts of Luk. 19. 42. 
                        Hosanna, saluted King of Israell; his reioycing was teares, with sighes for Ierusalem, that knew Christs triumphs was teares. not of that her visitation.
                     Neither after his death had hee the preheminence (as most of them had) to bee buried in the graues of Christ poore after death their fathers, but was laid in the Mat. 27. 60. 
                        Sepulchre of another man, and at another mans charge intombed: such fauours the world affoorded vnto this great king.
                     And therefore as it hath been of him prophesied, that he Isay. 53. 
                        should be a man despised, without forme or beautie, meeke, & lowly, as a Sheep to the slaughter, 
                        Christs appearance according to the Prophets. 
                        a iust and a poore King; so was it expedient that all these parts, in the person of Iesus should bee fulfilled. And so himselfe taught in the way to Emaus, when hee Luk. 24. 27. 
                        began at Moses and all the Prophets, and by them proued, that Christ ought so to haue liued, & so to haue suffered as he did.
                     
                        
And therefore the obiection made by Iulian and others, that had Christ beene really king of the Iews, than had he exercised the authority really of King of the Iewes; deserueth no answeare.
                     For as he was called, and verily Christ caled the son of man, yet had no man to his father. was the Sonne of Man, although he had no immediate father among men vpon the earth: so was he called, and verily was, king of the Iewes, though he vsed no kingly authority among men on the earth.
                     And why should that be obiected more against Iesus, then against all his Ancestors the high Saints, 
                        The ancestors of Christ kept from the crown, which Christ came not to recouer. from Abiud to Ioseph, who by birth, were the vndoubted heires to that Crowne, which notwithstanding was vsurped vpon by the Gentiles, aboue the space of 400. yeeres.
                     Neither had they any promise, that they should euer recouer that that terrestriall kingdome; but rather, that they should possesse the eternall, which Dā. 7. 17 none could take from them.
                     And that Christ Iesus was King
                        
of that Kingdome promised: and that Sonne, that should sit vpon 2. Sam. 7. 16. 
                        Dauids Throne for euer: (which none besides him could euer doe, wee may further proue by his life after death.

                     For the same humane body that was borne King of the Iewes, (so called Christ body resuming life, had the same faculties as before. and acknowledged) liuing after death; the same humane body (though being also glorified) had the same faculties, preheminence, and prerogatiues of life, and rights thereunto belonging, as before in his body was subsisting.

retaine him in the graue, his humane body after his resurrection, was againe verily a humane man among men vpon earth the space of forty daies. In which at sundry times hee was seene both (saith the Apostle) of the Apostles; and at one time, 1. Cor. 15 6. 
                        of aboue fiue hundred brethren at once: All of them being faithfull witnesses of his presence in the flesh, for The many witnesses of Christs reresurrection. of the vnfaithfull after his resurrection, hee was neuer seene in his flesh.
                     And now Dauids Kingdome come to the full period, and Eph. 2. 14. the wall of seperation betweene Iew and Gentile puld downe, when the Mat. 27. 51. vaile of the Temple was rent assunder, Christ Iesus then that was heire of of all, before all beginnings, is thenceforth King ouer all, vnto all Christ the accomplisher of what was foretold. eternities.

and by the title of King of the Iewes, was sought for, acknowledged, and so stiled, as the onely next heire to Salomons Crowne, as we haue shewed.
                     But that earthly Canaan vsurped by Herod, and the Caesars; hee came Christ came not to disturb peace. not by strength to recouer, the terme of that tennor so neerely expired; but rather taught that Luk. 20. 25.

                     But that the Olimpicks could bee the Light to leade to that Starre, or to enlighten the sacred stories by their accounts, is so farre from effect, as they rather much darken the Olimpiads falsifie the true Chronoligie of Scripture. true Chronologie of the one, and confound the mutuall agreements of the other: nor haue they any assured truth for time in themselues.

                        The fifty fiue Olympiad cannot be the first of King Cyrus.
                         (most certenly fixed in the diuine Chronologie, as the pole is in the North) cannot fit the fifty fiue Olimpiad, for their diuers beginnings.
                     The other proofe is taken from the destruction of Ierusalems Temple which Stro. 1. 
                        Clemens Alexandrinus saith, happened in the last of the forty seuenth Olimpiad. Now wee know by the holy Text, that the destruction

of the Temple was in the 2. King. 25. 8. nineteenth yeere of Nebuchadnezzer King of Babell, from whence to the end of the captiuity, or first of Cyrus, fiftie one yeeres more were to ensue, to make vp the Ie. 25. 11 seuentie of the captiuity.
                     But from the last yeere of the forty seuenth Olympiad, to the first of the fifty fiue, are but twenty nine yeeres: whereunto adde nineteene more from Nebuchadnezzers first yeere, in the which the Ier. 25. captiuity began, vnto the Temples destruction in his ninteenth; and yet there will wāt of the seuēty, twenty two yeers to the end of the captiuity. Wherby we see, that the first yeere of Cyrus 
                        
                           Cyrus his first yeere cannot be in the fifty fiue Olimpiad. must bee pulled backe, and set in the fiftieth, and not the fifty fiue Olympiad: so far differing are these prophane Olympiads, from the sacred Chronologie of the holy text.
                     That a most certen and exact Chronologie was registred from Adam the first man, vnto the first yeer of King Ezr. 1. 1.

                           ty yeeres of captiuity, and thēce to Christs death were 77. the beginning of Daniels prayer, the Angell Gabriel was sent from God, to shew him, that the Commandement for the deliuerance of the people was come forth; and from that comming forth of the

Commandement, to the death of the Messiah seuenty seuens, were determined for a full deliuery from the captiuity of sinne, by the sacrifice of the Messiah, Christ the Lamb figured in the Law.
                     And that this Commandement came forth in the first yeere of Cyrus, the writers of the Chronicles and the booke of Ezra doe plainly declare; both of them affirming and saying, that in the 
                        2 Chr. 36 22. 
                        first yeere of Cyrus, when the Word of the Lord spoken by the mouth of Ieremiah was finished, the Lord stirred vp the spirit of Cyrus King of Persia, and hee made a proclamation through all his kingdome, and also by writing, saying:
                     
                     
                        Thus saith 
                        Ezr. 1. 2. 
                        Cyrus King of Persia, all the kingdoms of the earth, hath the Lord God of heauen giuen mee, and hee hath commanded mee to build him a house in 
                        
                           Cyrus his decree for the Iewes deliuerāce. 
                        Ierusalem, that is in Iudah. Who is among you of all his people, with wbom the Lord his God is? let him goe vp.
                     
                     And of this commandement made by Cyrus, for the returne of the Iewes, to build their Citie and

Temple, the Prophet Isaiah foretould aboue an hundred yeeres before Cyrus was borne; for saith he, Isa. 44. 28. 
                        He saith to Cyrus, thou art my Shepheard & he shal performe all my desire: saying to Ierusalem, thou shalt be built▪ and to the Temple, thy foundation shal be surely laid: By which words of the Prophets wee conclude; That not a linke of the sacred chaine of Chronologie, is either broken or opened, betwixt the commandement giuen by Cyrus the Lords Shepheard, and the death of Christ the great Shepheard, when hee gaue his 
                        Ioh. 10. 11. 
                        life for his Flock.
                     
                     For as time is chained linke vnto linke from Adam to Cyrus; so is it chained linke vnto linke from Cyrus, to the death of Christ by the speech of an Angel, without al helps of the disagreeing Olympicks: who in The Olimpiads cannot let Christ to be Christ. this diuine Chronologie, do but trouble the waters of Shiloh, and can be no let for time, but that the Messiah in Daniels text, is Christ Iesus, our Lord and Sauiour.
                     
                     And therefore let vs measure

vnto him the true Temple and Altar, with the Apo. 1. 1 
                        Reed of Gabriel, as Iohn did the Temple and Altar with the Reed of the Angel; and in this case cast out the accoūts of the heathenish Olympiads, as Iohn did cast out and not measure the Court, for that was giuen to the Gentiles. And so come we to his other Assertion, which is, that the text of holy Scrip ture in Daniel, will not Liuely in Pers. mon. pag. 203. permit the name Messiah to be referred vnto Christ Iesus our Sauiour.
                     
                     That Christ Iesus (saith hee) could The second assertion. be the Messiah mentioned in Daniel, the hebrew word,

                     So that the word Messiah in Daniels text, he will haue, not to be meāt of Christ, as it is in Ioh. 1. 41 
                        Iohns Gospel, and in the second Psa. 2. 2. 
                        Psalme; but rather a succession of gouernors both Iewes and Romans, that ruled in Ierusalem, from the rebuilding thereof by

                        Nehemiah; vntill the finall destruction both of Citie and Temple by Titus the Emprour.
                     And those that referre the word Messiah in that place vnto Christ Iesus (saith hee) cannot so doe 
                        pag. 201.

                        straining or wresting of the text, which they who so vnderstād it are driuen vnto. For as the Chronologie here fitteth not for Messiah to be vnderstood of Christ our Lord, so the very text it selfe is against it.
                     And therefore, he pag. 170 
                        pitieth that the Message of an holy Angell containing a most excellent prophecy from Gods owne mouth, should be so peruerted

                        and depraued, as it hath beene by those that picke out that sense.
                     
                     But is it not a greater pitie, that learning should thus turne edge vpon Diuinity, to depraue vs of one of the most pregnant prophecy, for Christ his passion reuealed in the The matter is too sad to be thus da

beene prophecied, and whose tennor was shortly to be determined; rather then vnto him, who by that his foreshewed death, was to bring an estate of euerlasting life, and whose Kingdom should neuer haue end.
                     
                     Therefore to free the text from any such interpretation, let vs take the consent of all almost, those malicious Iewes excepted, that either speake against their owne knowledge and conscience, or haue the The best learned Rabbins acknowledge the Messiah in that text of Daniel.

                     But the best approued Docters among them, as Rabbi Saadias, Rabbi Nahman, and Rabbi Hadarson, expounding that text of Daniel, agree rhat the Messiah there spoken of, is Christ, the very annointed of God: so farre are they from attributing that name to any other besids him, though God hath giuen them the spi rit of slumber, not to insee what themselues say:
                     And of Christian expositers, wee take the testimony, euen of the aduersarie himselfe who saith, that

                        the most part, and best learned of those who haue laboured for the vnderstanding of this Prophecy, haue vnderstood

                        the Messiah here spoken of, to bee Iesus Christ. 
                        Very good witnesses against a nouell opinion.
                     
                     And how generally true that opinion is, and hath beene, the worthy instrument of Gods truth, the learned Du. Plessie, in his truenesse of Christian Religion doth testify, where he saith, 
                           Du Ples. in tru. of Christian Relig. c. 29. 
                        That this text is meant of the Messiah (Christ) is so euident and absolute, that it is a starke shame to deny it.
                     
                     And Lyra our Countryman, against the resisting Iewes, from the adiunct giuen vnto the Messiah, frameth this argument, 
                           Nicholas Lyra his argumēt for Christ. 
                        The Messiah in Daniel (saith he) is called Messiah Prince, for so the word 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         
                        doth signifie; but none is called Messiah the prince but only Christ; therefore is Christ the very Messiah spoken of in Dvniel.
                     
                     Neither doth that Prophet speake of many, but of one and the same Messiah, and he to bee slaine to confirme the Couenant, and to take away Sinne, which none did nor

could doe, but onely Christ by his death, and therefore Christ is the Messiah there slaine.
                     And surely the efficacie of his death doth very strongly confirme the same, both in sealing his couenant of mercie in each beleeuing heart, through the power of his Gospell, and in ending the Act. 6. 14 ceremonies of the place once holy.
                     And therefore we conclude, that in this text of Daniel (as Phillip did in Ioh. 2. 45 
                        Iohns) we haue found the Messiah, of whom Moses wrote, and the Prophets spake. And that Christ Iesus alone, vnto whom al the scriptures leade), was the onely accomplisher of that diuine Prophecy, who in halfe the last seuen, that is, after his baptisme; in preaching and in miracles confirmed the Couenant for many: and lastly in the end of the last seuen, and yeere of of Iubile by his death & passion, finished wickednesse, restrained sin, reconciled iniquitie, and sealed vp Vision and Prophecie, vnto whō be ascribed our saluation, and his glorie

for euer. Amen.
                     But against this opinion of Lyra, Liuelie is confident, and will haue the appellatiue, Gouerner, Captaine, or Prince, to be of no force in argument against his exposition: but rather by the word Nagid it selfe, would proue the contrary, and maketh it wholly a supporter of his conceited opinion of a double gouernment, and no whit to appertaine vnto Christ the Messiah. For (saith he) the Hebrew word 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         signifying any Ruler or Gouernour, is vsed sometime of Kings, as Saul is called the Gouernour of the Lords inheritance, 1. Samuel 10. 1. Dauid is called the Ruler of Gods people, 2. Sam. 7. 8. And King Hezekiah is called, the Captaine of the Lords people, 2. Kings 20. 5.
                     And sometime it is giuen to other inferiour Rulers or Gouernours, such as Rehoboam placed in his strong holds, 2. Chron. 11. 11. and Iehoshaphat ouer the House of Iudah, 2. Chro. 19. 11. in all which places the word Nagid is vsed. And therefore (faith

he) Liuel. in Pers. Mo. pag. 170. 
                        there is no let by the force and signification of the word, but that it may be well referred to the chiefe Ruler of the Iewes commonwealth in Ierusalem, after the building thereof. And to that purpose doth applie the word, in his Coment vpon the Come Gouernour.
                     
                     
                        Pag. 175

                        a Ruler which is to come. For in the times before the destruction of Ierusalem by the Romans; there were two Rulers of the Citie, one of their owne people, a Iew by profession and birth, after their manner annointed to the gouernment of the Commonwealth among them, here named in the verse afore going 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         
                        the annointed Prince; the 
                        It can neuer be proued, that all the Gouernours of the people were annointed. 
                        other a stranger appointed deputie by the Romans Emperour called 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         
                        a Ruler not borne in the Countrie, or one of the same Nation, but a stranger come from another place.
                     
                     Into which opinion he saith, he was both led and confirmed by ancient Eusebius, who held, that the annointed gouernour in that text of

                        Daniel is none other, but a succession of High Priests, which after this prophecie, and the Iewes returne from Babylon, gouerned the people; among whom hee nameth Iudas Macchabeus, his brethren, and their posteritie.
                     And Master Liuelie himselfe doth somewhat more Pag. 205 largely attribute the word Gouernour, vnto other Rulers and Kings of the Iewes Common-wealth, which as he affirmeth (but without proofe) were after their manner Pag. 175 annointed, vtterly exempting Christ Iesus out of that Text of Daniel. Whereunto wee answere.
                     First as touching the word (Nagid) indifferently giuen to diues men of diuers degrees, wee say, that albeit those by him cited, and more besides, had that title appropriated, for the more dignitie to their persons and places: yet in none of those texts by him alleaged, nor in any other, is to bee found the apposition Nagid ioyned with the primarie word Messiah, sauing onely in that text of Daniel, much lesse then to any

succeeding Gouernour, many of The vsurping Leuits and the vncircumcised Romans, are not worthy of that most sacred name 
                              •…
                           essiah. them vsurping (as those of the Leuites did) vpon Iudahs right, and some of them vncircumcised Gentiles (the Romans) farre vnworthy of the name Messiah, or to bee called the (Nagid) Gouernour of the Lords people.
                     Next that, Eusebius held a succession of Priests we see in his workes; Euseb, in lib de Demon. Euangelica. but withall we say it is very likely that Eusebius called backe his error himselfe, seeing hee makes the halfe of the last Seuen to belong vnto Christ: for (saith he) the Greeke Church hath rightly obserued foure Paschals from the Lords Baptisme vnto his Death. Howsoeuer, an error dying H. B. in Aduert. with the man, should not againe be quickened, if nothing but Antiquity did excuse him.
                     And though wee should allow a Succession of Priests, and Princes, that ruled in Iudea from Iaddua downeward, The Romans medled not with the Iewes before Pompeys time. yet I thinke it will be hard to proue, that the Romans had any stroke in that Countrey, before Gabinius was made Lieutenant of Siria,
                        
which was but fifteen yeers before the raigne of Octauian Augustus.
                     
                     And harder, that all the former Gouernours (much lesse the later) were euer annointed, as hee affirmeth: for wee doe not reade; that either Moses, Ioshuah, Zorubbabel, or Nehemiah, all of them Princes and Gouernours of the people, were annointed; nor indeede any King of Iudahs Throne, excepting such as No annointing vsed but on the first, or vpon strife. were the first, or after the first, stood either vpon change of Families, or else vpon strife.
                     So 1. Sam. 10. 1. 
                        Saul the first King was annointed: So 1. Sam. 16. 13. 
                        Dauid of another Tribe vpon his reiection was annointed. So Salomon 
                        
                           
                              〈◊〉
                           . King. 1. 39. in the conspiracies of Adoniah, was annointed. So Ioash 
                        2. King. 11. 12. in the vsurpations of Athaliah, was annointed: and so Iehoahaz 
                        2. King. 23. 30. the younger brother to Iehoiakim was annointed: and besides these, wee find none of those Not any annointed after the returne from Babylon. Kings annointed nor any at all vnder the second Temple, as Du Plessie hath well obserued.
                     
                        
Lastly, that the word Nagid, the Prince, is an attribute and note of excellencie vnto the Messiah spoken of in Daniel, the Rabbins of them-Iewes confesse, and among them Rabbi Iudah commenting vpon that text, saith, that this Messiah was the hope of Israel, and the Commander of Nations: alleaging for his proofe this text of Esay; 
                        Isai. 55. 4 
                        I haue giuen him for a witnesse to the people, a Prince, and a Commander to the people. And all almost consent, that the title Nagid, Captaine, or Prince, is particularly giuen vnto Christ, the annointed of God.
                     
                     And that no stranger was meant in the Hebrew word Haba, the learned Iunius affirmeth, who interpreteth 
                           Iunius vpon Dan. 9 
                        He the Prince, to be the Messiah Christ Iesus: For (saith he) He that is the Messiah the Prince, shal destroy the people of the Prince, his owne people which shall come, that is, which shall be then.
                     And the great Hebrecian H. B. 
                        In Aduert. of corrupt. is confident, that the word Ba, vsed by the Angell, is, to come, and is neuer

vsed for a Stranger, but in men the age following; and so (saith he) the Angell meant, that Christ in the age following would destroy the Iews, his owne kindred, the vnbeleeuing. Vnto which opinion Tremelius likewise consenteth.
                     And these Expositers that by the word, Haba Nagid, the Prince to come, will haue the Romans meant, yet meane not (as master Liuelie doth) for ioynt Gouernours with the Iewes in Ierusalems estate, but rather for destroyers of that Commonwealth to fulfill Gods wrath vpon the place, as vnder Titus, the sonne of Uespasian, they did, to an vtter desolation both of Citie and Sanctuarie as with a floud.
                     To make then this most plaine text of holy Scripture concerning Christ his sealing of mans redemption, to be but a Gouernment established betwixt the Gentile Roman, and the faithlesse Iew, is to adde darknes to night, and to make the ignorant more ignorant still.
                     But as the day cannot be separated from the Sunne, nor mount Sions
                        
situation from Psa. 125. 1 before Ierusalem; so the text in Daniel; to finish wickednes, to abolish sinnes, to make reconciliation for 
                              〈◊〉
                            to bring righteousnesse euerlasting, to seale vp

                           Daniels speech not to be separated. which immediatly in the next verses doe follow, namely, that the Messiah should be killed, to make a sure couenant for many, and to end sacrifice and oblation.
                     
                     The one being so linked into the other with such glory and strength, as the go d

                     But as Master Liuelies conceit hath been touching Daniels Messiah, in making that holy name to import none other, then a ioynt gouernment of Iewes and Romans ruling together in the new erected estate vnder the second Temple: so is his conceit likewise, touching the ceasing of Daniels Sacrifices, who will in no wise admit them to end

in Christ Iesus, when he offered himselfe the most acceptable sacrifice vpon the Altar the Crosse at his death; but will haue them to con tinue fortie yeeres after, euen to the siege and sacking of Ierusalem: for Liuelie Persian Monarch. pag. 219. & 220. (saith he) when Uespasian was come into Iudea, and wasted the Countrey, then the vnruly Rebels abolished the lawfull custome of sacrificing, and the Priests being slaine by them, for want of men there was no oblation any more. And therefore not without cause (saith hee) in my iudgement, may those words of Daniel touching the sacrifice ceasing in the middest of the last weeke, bee referred vnto these times of this warre: wherein by meanes thereof, the sacrifices of the Lords house were hindred so many waies: some were quite abolished, and others done either not by those to whom they pertained, or not so safely and freely as thy ought.

                        We are yet in our sinnes: and the Iewes haue exceptions, that our Iesus of Marie, is not the sauing Messiah.

                     Some thinke him to bee Ioshuah the High Priest, that accompanied the Returned to build againe Ierusalem, of which opinion is Rabbi Leui ben Gershon: and some hold him to

be Nehemiah, that finished the walles of Ierusalem, of which mind is the enuious Iew Aben Ezra.
                     
                     Some will haue the Messiah to be none other then a Succession of Priests and Macchabees gouerning the Common wealth of Iudea; as the conuerted Iew Paulus Burgensis thinketh: and some will haue him to bee Agrippa, the last Gouernour of that state in the time of their miserable calamities, vnto which conceite some later haue inclined.
                     And all of them almost in their infidelitie attribute the title Messiah (Nagid) vnto any, rather then vnto Iesus our Sauiour, the true Annointed indeed.
                     Had not then the Apostle iust cause to account these Rabinicall Genealogies, both vaine and foolish, and to forewarne his Disciples Timothie and Titus, not to

the time of their liues, yet by their No death valuable but the death of Christ. deaths (for death was the set marke or Seale of Redemption) no benefit accrued to the meanest Iew read of.
                     And Cyrus the first of them, dying long before the last seuen, and Agrip pa the last of them, liuing after the destruction of the Citie, meet not their accomplishments in the last seuen, and yeere of Iubilee, as the death of Iesus the true Messias did: where ended the ceremonies, and policie of the place.
                     
                     For when the gold of the Temple was become greater then the Temple it selfe, righteousnesse vrged in circumcision and the Law, Moses expounded no further then the literall sense led, the Iewes boasting of Ioh. 8. 33 
                        Abraham, and a continued succession: then looke what was done vnto Shiloh, as Ier. 26. 6

                        Behold, the daies shall come vpon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee shall besiege, and lay thee euen with the ground.
                     
                     But so farre was her fall from the peoples conceit, and so incredulous was the date of their pollicie, predicted by the Angell, as when Saint Stephen (whose face was like his, and words the very same) touched the string to that sound, Act. 7. 54 
                        their hearts were cut for anger, and they stoned him to death as a blasphemer.
                     For, holding themselues the onely and peculiar people of God (though for a time now made subiect to the Romans) they daily attempted to The Iewes expectations. free their estates; and vnder pretext of the Law commanded by Moses, that Deut. 17 15.

                        Shepheard, the Lords fellow, smitten, and the sheepe scattered; sold for thirty peeces of

                        hands and feete should be pierced, his garments diuided, and lots cast for his vesture. And Daniel saw him slaine, to

                        confirme the Couenant, and to seale vp vision and Prophet. His bones were not broken, to answere the Iohn 19. 33. 
                        Law of the Lambe: his side pierced, to assure his Za. 12. 10 death.
                     And his death done amongst Esay 53. 
                        Malefactors, with such signes from Heauen, in the earth, & in the renting of the vayle, as his Luk. 23. 48. be holders smiting their breasts, confessed he was the Sonne of God.
                     
                     But to gather al in one, and from thatone, against whom the Iewes dare not speake, euen Esay the Prophet, and of their Bloud royall; let vs lay downe his text, as it lieth in his words, whose preface vnto his speech beginneth thus;
                     
                        Who 
                        Esay 53. 
                        will beleeue our report? and to
                        
                        whom is the arme of the Lord reuealed? 2. But he shall grow vp before him as a 
                        2 
                        Branch, and as a roote out of a drie ground: he hath neither forme nor beautie: when we shall see him, there shall bee no forme that we should desire him. 3. He is despised and reiected of men: hee is a 
                        3 
                        man full of sorrowes, and hath experience of infirmities: we hid as it were our faces from him: he was despised, and we esteemed him not. 4. Surely hee hath 
                        4 
                        borne our infirmities, and carried our sorrowes: yet wee did iudge him, as plagued and smitten of God, and humbled. 5. But 
                        5 
                        hee was wounded for our transgressions, he was broken for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was vpon him, and with his stripes we are healed. 6. All we 
                        6 
                        like sheepe haue gone astray: wee haue turned euery one to his owne way and the Lord hath laid vpon him the iniquity of vs all. 7. He was oppressed, and hee was▪
                         
                        7 
                        afflicted, yet did he not open his mouth: he is brought as a sheepe to the slaughter and as a sheepe before her shearer is dum, so hee ope
                              •…
                           ed not his mouth. 8. He 
                        8 
                        was taken out from prison, and from iudgement: and who shall declare his
                        
                        age? for he was cut out of the Land of the liuing: for the transgression of my people was he plagued. 9. And hee made 
                        9 
                        his graue with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, though hee had done no wickednesse, neither was any deceit in his mouth. 10. Yet the Lord would breake him, and make him subiect to infirmities: 
                        10 
                        when hee shall make his soule an offering for sinne, he shall see his seed, and shall prolong his daies, and the will of the Lord shall prosper in his hand. 11. He shall see of the trauell of his soule, 
                        11 
                        and shall bee satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous seruant iustifie many: for he shall beare their iniquities.
                     
                     Herein I appeale to your selues, O yee children of the Prophets: what haue our Euangelists written, that this your Prophet did not write before: for substance so much, and for words so agreeing, as they seeme to fall from his pen, who saw the passion himselfe, and beares record 
                        Ioh. 19. 35. 
                        that his sayings are true? or to what other person can his text be applied, then vnto Iesus, so borne, so liuing, so despised, and so crucified; that to fulfill

all, his death was done without the He. 13. 11 
                        gate, as the 
                        Le. 6. 12. 
                        Bullock was burnt without the Campe.
                     
                     And that the times drawne the actions onely to that age, heare how the Scriptures are loude. Iacob told Iudah, that the d Scepter should not depart

                        from his Tribe vntill Shiloh came: and how Iudahs gouernment ended by the cruelty of Herod, in slaughtering their Sanhedrin,

                        Phylo a man of their owne, doth declare. And their Rabbins likewife, in their Talmud Seder olam, thus cry out, Tal. Ierusal. ca. Sanhedrin

                        Idumean tyrant, by the fauour of Antonius, had first set, and after by Agustus, surer setled Iudahs crowne vpon his owne head; whose faire lustre made him so to persecute the lawfull heire thereof, as lest hee should escape, hee slaughtered all the male Infants in those coasts of Iewry, and among them

                        his owne sonne, as Macrobius reporteth.
                     The

                        Iubile likewise for freedome, the onely Feast in the yeere; and that yeere appointed to bee euerie fiftieth, must haue an end in the substance, as all other Ceremonies had. Which great yeere, that the people did expect it, our Luke declareth, for in his time they thought that Lu. 19. 11. 
                        the Kingdome of God should shortly appeare and that then Iesus from their Esa. 61. 1 
                        Isaiah at 
                        Luk. 4 16 
                        Nazaret did preach it, they bare him witnesse, and wondred at the gracious words that came out of his mouth.
                     
                     And surely, if wee begin to account them (as wee must) from the seuenth yeere of Ioshuah, when the Lands full conquest was accomplished; we shall find twenty eight fiftieths vnto that of the Passion, where al freedome was purchased: when Christ in his last words vpon the Crosse, cryed, Ioh. 19. 30. 
                        It is finished.
                     
                     Besides these agreements of figure and substance, the Prophet Daniel declaring the change of

states by the metaline Image, shewed to Nebuchadnezzar, giues limits to the kingdoms therin contained, till a Stone cut without hands from the mountaine, should fall vpon, and breake to powder, the Gold, the Siluer, the 
                        Dan. 2. 45. 
                        Brasse, the Iron, and the Clay: al which should bee blowne away, as the chaffe of the Summer flowers; but the Stone that so fell, should fill the whole earth.
                     
                     Now, that the euent was according, is euidently seene; for Cleopatra, the proud and lasciuious Queen of Egypt, the last successor, or Toe of the Image, for the death of Antonius, stung herfelfe to death with a Serpent; what time Egypt, the one legge by Octauian was made a Prouince to Rome, as Syria the other by Pompey before had beene.
                     And that a full dissolution of euery part of the Image vpon her death happened, the taxing of the world then laid by Augustus, doth testifie; when the Roman Monarchi, with acknowledged subiection first began: and vpon which occasion

                        Christ was borne in Beth-lehem, two 
                           Beda saith that Christ was borne in the thirty one yeere of King Herod, whose raigne was thirty seuen yeere. yeeres before the death of Herod.
                     
                     And that this Stone was Christ, all almost acknowledged; neither doth the euent fall in any other, the Gospell being the Mountaine that spred his kingdome ouer the face of the whole earth. And what that Stone signified, Daniel told Nebuchadnezzar, 
                        Beda. lib. 6 de Etatibus. as Iosephus writeth: which though himselfe thought not fit in that his Ioseph. anti

                            lib. 10. cap. 15 discourse there to expresse, yet afterwards in the com motions of the Iewes against Pilat, hee speaketh both of Iohn Baptist, slaughtered by Herod, and of Iesus condemned to the Crosse, in these venerable words.
                     
                        Ioseph. his opinion of Christ. Ioseph. Anti
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                            lib. 18. c. 4. & 7 
                        At that time (saith he) was Iesus a wise man, if it bee lawfull to call him a man. For he was the performer of diuers admirable workes, and the instructer of those, who willingly entertaine the truth: and hee drew vnto him diuers Iewes and Greekes to bee his followers. This was Christ; who beeing accused by the Princes of our Nation before Pilat, and afterwards condemned to
                        
                        the Crosse by him; yet did not those who followed him from the beginning, forbeare to loue him for the ignominie of his death. For he appeared vnto them aliue the third day after, according as the diuine Prophets had before testified the same; and diuerse other wonderfull things of him: and from that time for, ward, the race of the Christians, who haue deriued their Name from him hath neuer ceased.
                     
                     What testimony can bee greater then this, so agreeing with the Miracles, death, and resurrection of Christ; especially from his pen, who wrote the History of the Iewes, from Moses, the first, vnto the destruction of Ierusalem, and last times of their estate: being as all men know, by birth a Iew himselfe, and in his yong yeeres might haue seene the same Iesus, of whom he giueth such commendable reports.
                     But to confirme the fall of the Image, which Daniel had affirmed by the fall of the Stone, is the testimony of the Angel sent vnto him, to shew the times that were to succeede.

For the Prophet praying for a present releasement from Babels captiuity, was answered by Gabriel aboue Dan. 9. 24. his request: namely, that after seuentie seuens of yeeres, a perfect deliuerance should bee wrought by the death of the Messiah, which shoul
                           •…
                         
                        end Sinne, and the Ceremonies of the place, and should bring an euerlasting freedome to all that beleeue.
                     And that these yeeres so predicted, fell in number, weight, and measure, euen 490. we haue shewed before, and now further affirme, that the very houres by a skifull Arithmetician may be exactly calculated, from the message of the Angell deliuered at the time of the euening oblation, vnto the voice vtte

                        Zerubbabel,
                        
after the returne from Babylon▪
                         which worke, though later and lesser then that of Salomons, had notwithstanding a promise from GOD to Hag. 2. 10 exceed Salomons.
                     
                     But how glorious his was, the building, guilding, riches, and beautie doth euidently declare: and the 1. King. 8 11. 
                        cloud of Gods glory so filling the house, as the Priest could not minister, doth manifestly shew.
                     Whereas contrariwise, this second was so inferiour, as the olde men that had seene the former, Ezra 3. 12. 
                        wept exceedingly at the laying of the foundation: neither was it filled with any such glorious Clowd, nor had the like Patternes of Gods diuine presence, as Salomons had.
                     For in this second Temple, as the Rabbins haue obserued, these fiue great blessings were wanting. 1: The fier from heauen to consume the Sacrifices, the visible signe of Gods fauourable acceptance. 2. The Vrim and 
                        Exo. 28. 30.

                        Exo. 17. 10. 
                        Arons Rod, and Exo. 16. 33. 
                        pot of Manna were kept. 4. The Mercy seate and Cherubins, from whom the oracles of God were reuealed. 5. And the manifest breathing of the holy Ghost vpon the Prophets: all which Salomons Temple had.
                     Contrariwise, before the daies of Christ, this later Temple was polluted and defiled by Antiochus, Pompey, and Crassus; and after the death of Christ, vtterly destroyed by Titus, Domitian, Hadrian, and other Roman Emperours. And being assaied againe to be built by Iulian 
                        Amia. Marcel. lib. 23. ca. 1 the Apostata, was with earthquakes and fier from heauen so hindred, as the foundations of the first Temple, left in the former destructions, were so shaken asunder, that a stone was not left standing vpon astone; and Socrates lib. 3. c. 17. the workemen by fier from heauen forced to leaue off the attempt. Since which time, in seeking to rebuild that, which Christ had so accursed, more Christian bloud hath been spilt, then was in those wars

of destruction which Iosephas writeth of and saw. Wherein then was the glory of this second Temple greater then Salomons, or what should Hag. 2. 8. moue the desire of all nations to come thereunto.
                     Surely, it was the Lord whom they sought, and the Messenger of the

                        Esa. 49. 6 
                        saluation vnto the Gentiles: which was accomplished onely in the person of Christ Iesus, who with his presence filled this later house with greater glory then the clowd did that of Salomons.
                     
                     When in this Temple hee taught that his Body was the true Temple indeed; and that the Ioh. 2. 19

                        remembrance of incense, as the blessing of an Idoll. So that when sacrifice and offerings were not desired, burnt offering and sinne offrings not required, then said he Psal. 40. 6. 
                        Lo, I come; for in the rolle of the booke it is written of me, I desired to do thy will, O my God.

                  To the Christian Reader.
                  TO forward thy study and knowledge in the holy Genealogies of the sacred Scriptures, I haue (Christian Reader) in this following Table, directed thee to the ready finding of any person or name contained in the draughts of those that are printed with the new Bible of the last Translation, which doe serue alike for foure seuerall volumes, with one and the same directions. And whereas in some of them, the Scriptures cotations could not be inserted, in this they are all supplied both for Chapter and verse. Wherein obserue, that the most noted among them of any Nation, Kindred and Tribe, vpon whom the chiefest stories in Scriptures depend, are noted by a differing letter, and by the like letters in the Margent set against them, are knowne of what degrees or estate they were.
                  
                     Our Lords line is noted by the letter——L
                     All Kings in generall by this letter——K
