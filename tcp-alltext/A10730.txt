                  Richard Plantagenet of the Houſe of Yorke,
                  Claiming the Crowne by warres, not by diſſent,
                  Had as the Chronicles make manifeſt,
                  In the two and twentith yeare of Henry the ſixth,
                  By act of Parliament intailed to him
                  The Crowne and titles to that dignitie,
                  And to his ofſpring lawfully begotten,
                  
                     After the deceaſe of that forenamed King,
                  Yet not contented for to ſtaie the time,
                  Made warres vpon King Henry then the ſixth,
                  And by outrage ſuppreſſed that vertuous King,
                  And wonne the Crowne of England to himſelfe,
                  But ſince at Wakefield in a battell pitcht,
                  Outragious Richard breathed his lateſt breath,
                  Leauing behind three branches of that line,
                  Three ſonnes: the firſt was Edward now the King,
                  George of Clarence, and Richard Glosters Duke,
                  Then Henry claiming after his deceaſe
                  His ſtile, his Crowne and former dignitie
                  Was quite ſuppreſſed, till this Edward the fourth.

                  In what eſtate I now lie it is ſeene to you all,
                  And I feele my ſelfe neare the dreadfull ſtroke of death.
                  And the cauſe that I haue requeſted you in friendly wiſe
                  To meete togither is this,
                  That where malice & enuy ſowing ſedition in the harts of men
                  So would I haue that admoniſhed and friendly fauours,
                  Ouercome in the heart of yon Lord Marcus and Lord Haſtings
                  
                  Both, for how I haue gouerned theſe two and twentie yeares,
                  I leaue it to your diſcretions.
                  The malice hath ſtill bene an enemy to you both,
                  That in my life time I could neuer get any lege of amity betwixt you,
                  Yet at my death let me intreate you to imbrace each other,
                  
                     That at my laſt departure you may ſend my ſoule
                  To the ioyes celeſtiall:
                  For leauing behinde me my yoong ſonne,
                  Your lawfull King after my deceaſe,

                  To his famous realme of England.
                  But (what ſaith Lord Marcus and Lord Haſtings)
                  What not one word? nay then I ſee it will not be,
                  For they are reſolute in their ambition.

                  And you Lord Marcus, ſubmit your ſelfe,
                  See here the aged King my father,
                  How he ſues for peace betwixt you both:
                  Conſider Lord Marcus, you are ſon to my mother the Queene,
                  And therefore let me intreat you to mittigate your wrath,
                  And in friendly ſort, imbrace each other.

                  Nay ceaſe thy ſpeech Elizabeth,
                  It is but folly to ſpeake to them,
                  For they are reſolute in their ambitious mindes,
                  Therefore Elizabeth, I feele my ſelfe at the laſt inſtant of death,
                  And now muſt die being thus tormented in minde.
               
            
            
               Haſt.

                  curtuous word of Elizabeth his daughter,
               
               May withdraw thy ambition from me.

                  Canſt not perceiue the marke his grace aimes at.
               
            
            
               Hast.
               No I am reſolute, except thou ſubmit.

                  And perhaps thy head may paie for the loſſes
               
            
            
               King.

                  What will you do to the yoon▪ Prince after my deceaſe?
                  For ſhame I ſay, depart from my preſence, and leaue me to my ſelf,

                     Ah my Lords, I thought I could haue commanded
                  A greater thing then this at your hands,
                  But ſith I cannot, I take my leaue of you both,
                  And ſo depart and trouble me no more.
               
            
            
               Hast.
               
                  With ſhame and like your Maieſtie I ſubmit therfore,
                  Crauing humble pardon on my knees,
                  And would rather that my body ſhal be a pray to mine enemy,
                  Rather then I will offend my Lord at the houre
                  And inſtance of his death.

               Eliza.
               
                  Ah yeeld Lord Marcus, ſith Lord Haſtings
                  Is contentented to be vnited.
               
            
            
               King.
               Ah yeeld Lord Marcus, thou art too obſtinate.

                  My gracious Lord, I am content,
                  And humbly craue your graces pardon on my knee,
                  For my foule offence,
                  And ſee my Lord my breſt opened to mine aduerſary,
                  That he may take reuenge, then once it ſhall be ſaid,
                  I will offend my gratious ſuffereigne.
               
            
            
               King.
               Now let me ſee you friendly giue one an other your hands.

                  Vowde to Lord Marcus, I craue confuſion.
               
            
            
               Marcus.
               Like oath take I, and craue confuſion.

               King.
               Confuſion.
               Now my Lords, for your yoong King, that lieth now at Ludlo,
               
               Attended with Earle Riuers, Lord Gray, his two vnkles,
               And the reſt of the Queenes kindred,
               I hope you will be vnto him as you haue bene to me,
               His yeares are but yoong, thirteene at the moſt,
               Vnto whoſe gouernment, I commit to my brother the Protector,
               But to thee Elizabeth my daughter,
               I leaue thee in a world of trouble,
               And commend me to thy mother, to all thy ſiſters,
               And eſpecially I giue thee this in charge vpon & at my death,
               Be loyall to thy brother during his authoritie,
               As thy selfe art vertuous, let thy praiers be modeſt,
               Still be bountifull in deuotion.
               And thus leauing thee with a kiſſe, I take my laſt farwell,
               For I am ſo ſleepie, that I muſt now make an ende,
               And here before you all, I commit my ſoule to almighty God,
               My ſauiour, and ſweet redeemer, my bodie to the earth,
               My Scepter and Crowne to the yoong Prince my ſonne:
               And now Nobles, draw the Curtaines and depart.
               He that made me ſaue me,
               Vnto whoſe hands I commit my ſpirit.
            
            The King dies in his bed.
            Enter Shores wife, and Hurſly her mayde.
            
               Shorſe.
               O Fortune, wherefore wert thou called Fortune?
               But that thou art fortunate?
               Thoſe whom thou fauoureſt be famous,
               Meriting mere mercie,
               And fraught with mirrors of magnanimitie,
               And Fortune I would thou hadſt neuer fauoured me.
            
            
               Hurſ.
               Why miſtreſſe, if you exclaime againſt Fortune,
               You condemne your ſelfe▪
               
               
               For who hath aduanced you but Fortune?
            
            
               Shorſe.
               I as ſhe hath aduanced me,
               So may ſhe throw me downe:
               But Hurſly, doeſt not heare the King is ſicke?
            
            
               Hurſ.
               Yes miſtreſſe, but neuer heard that euerie ſicke man died.
            
            
               Shore.
               Ah Hurſly, my minde preſageth
               Some great miſhaps vnto me,
               For laſt time I ſaw the King, me thought
               Gaſtly death approached in his face,
               For thou knowest this Hurſly, I haue bene good to all,
               And ſtill readie to preferre my friends,
               To what preferment I could,
               For what was it his grace would deny Shores wife?
               Of any thing, yea were it halfe his reuenewes,
               I know his grace would not ſee me want,
               And if his grace ſhould die,
               As heauens forfend it ſhould be ſo,
               I haue left me nothing now to comfort me withall,
               And then thoſe that are my foes will triumph at my fall,
               But if the King ſcape, as I hope he will,
               Then will I feather my neaſt,
               That blow the ſtormie winter neuer ſo cold,
               I will be throughly prouided for one:
               But here comes Lodwicke, ſeruant to Lord Haſtings,
               How now Lodwicke, what newes?
            
            Enters Lodwicke.
            
            
               Lod.
               Miſtreſſe Shore, my Lord would requeſt you
               To come and ſpeake with him.
            
            
               Shore.
               I will Lodwicke.
               But tell me what newes, is the King recouered?
            
            
               Lod.
               I miſtreſſe Shore, he hath recouered
               That he long lookt for.
            
            
               Shore.
               Lodwicke, how long is it ſince
               He began to mend?
            
            
               
               Lod.
               Euen when the greateſt of his torments had left him.
            
            
               Shore.
               But are the nobles agreed to the contentment of the Prince?
            
            
               Lod.
               The Nobles and Peeres are agreed as the King would wiſh them.
            
            
               Shorſe.
               Lodwicke thou reuiueſt me.
            
            
               Lod.
               I but few thought that the agreement and his life would haue ended togither.
            
            
               Shore.
               Why Lodwicke is he dead.
            
            
               Lod.
               In briefe miſtreſſe Shore, he hath changed his life.
            
            
               Shorſe.
               
                  His life, ah me vnhappie woman,
                  Now is miſery at hand,
                  Now will my foes tryumph at this my fall,
                  Thoſe whom I haue done moſt good, will now forſake me.
                  Ah Hurſly, when I enterteined thee firſt,
                  I was farre from change, ſo was I Lodwicke,
                  When I reſtored thee thy lands.
                  Ah ſweete Edward, farwell my gracious Lord and ſouereigne,
                  For now ſhall Shores wife be a mirrour and looking glaſſe,
                  To all her enemies.
                  Thus ſhall I finde Lodwicke, and haue cauſe to ſay,
                  That all men are vnconſtant.
               
            
            
               Lod.
               
                  Why miſtreſſe Shore, for the loſſe of one friend,
                  Will you abandon the reſt that wiſh you well?
               
            
            
               Shore.
               
                  Ah Lodwicke I muſt, for when the tree decaies
                  Whoſe fruitfull branch haue flouriſhed many a yeare,
                  Then farewell thoſe ioyfull dayes and oſſpring of my heart,
                  But ſay Lodwicke, who hath the King made Protector
                  During the innormitie of the yoong Prince.
               
            
            
               Lod.
               He hath made his brother Duke of Gloster Protector.
            
            
               Shore.
               
                  Ah me, then comes my ruine and decaie,
                  For he could neuer abide me to the death,
                  No he alwaies hated me whom his brother loued ſo well,
                  Thus muſt I lament and ſay, all the world is vnconſtant.
               
            
            
               Lod.
               
                  But miſtreſſe Shore, comfort your ſelfe,
                  And thinke well of my Lord,
                  
                     Who hath alway bene a helper vnto you.
               
            
            
               Shorſe.
               
                  Indeed Lodwicke to condemne his honour I cannot,
                  For he hath alway bene my good Lord,
                  For as the world is fickle, ſo changeth the minds of men.
               
            
            
               Lod.
               
                  Why miſtreſſe Shore, rather then want ſhould oppreſſe
                  You, that litle land which you beg'd for me of the King,
                  Shall be at your diſpoſe.
               
            
            
               Shorſe.
               Thanks good Lodwicke.
            
            Enters a Citizen, and Morton a ſeruing man.
            
               Citi.
               
                  O maiſter Morton, you are very welcome met,
                  I hope you thinke on me for my mony.
               
            
            
               Mor.

                  With thankes too.
               
            
            
               Citi.
               
                  Nay, I pray ſir let me haue my mony,
                  For I haue had thankes and too much more then I lookt for.
               
            
            
               Mor.
               
                  In faith ſir you ſhall haue it,
                  But you muſt beare with me a litle,
                  But ſir, I maruell how you can be ſo greedie for your mony,
                  When you ſee ſir, we are ſo vncertaine of our owne.
               
            
            
               Citi.
               
                  How ſo vncertaine of mine owne?
                  Why doeſt thou know any bodie wil come to rob me?
               
            
            
               Mor.
               Why no.
            
            
               Citi.
               Wilt thou come in the night and cut my throate?
            
            
               Mor.
               No.
            
            
               Citi.
               
                  Wilt thou and the reſt of thy companions,
                  Come and ſet my houſe on fire?
               
            
            
               Mor.
               Why no, I tell thee.
            
            
               Citi.
               Why how ſhould I then be vncertaine of mine owne?
            
            
               Mor.
               Why ſir, by reaſon the King is dead.
            
            
               Citi.
               
                  O ſir! is the King dead?
                  I hope he hath giuen you no quittance for my debt.
               
            
            
               Mor.
               
                  No ſir, but I pray ſtaie a while, and you ſhall haue it
                  Aſſoone as I can.
               
            
            
               Citi.
               
                  Well I muſt be content, where nothing is to be had,
                  The King looſeth his right they ſay,
                  But who is this?
               
            
            
               
               Mor.
               
                  Marry ſir it is miſtreſſe Shore,
                  To whom I am more beholding too for my ſeruice,
                  Then the deereſt friend that euer I had.
               
            
            
               Citi.
               And I for my ſonnes pardon.
            
            
               Mor.
               Now miſtreſſe Shore, how fare you?
            
            
               Shore.
               
                  Well Morton, but not ſo wel as thou haſt knowne me,
                  For I thinke I ſhalbe driuen to try my friends one day.
               
            
            
               Mor.
               
                  God forfend miſtreſſe Shore,
                  And happie be that Sunne ſhall ſhine vpon thee,
                  For preſeruing the life of my ſonne.
               
            
            
               Shore.
               
                  Gramercies good father,
                  But how doth thy ſonne, is he well?
               
            
            
               Citi.
               The better that thou liues, doth he.
            
            
               Shore.
               
                  Thankes father, I am glad of it,
                  But come maiſter Lodwicke ſhall we go?
                  And you Morton, youle beare vs company.
               
            
            
               Lod.
               
                  I miſtreſſe Shore,
                  For my Lord thinkes long for our comming.
               
            
            Exit omnes.
            
               Citi.
               
                  There there, huffer, but by your leaue,
                  The Kings death is a maime to her credit,
                  But they ſay, there is my Lord Haſtings in the Court,
                  He is as good as the Aſe of hearts at maw,
                  Well euen as they brew, ſo let them bake for me:
                  But I muſt about the ſtreetes, to ſee and I can meete
                  With ſuch cold cuſtomers as they I met withall euen now,
                  Maſſe if I meete with no better,
                  I am like to keepe a bad hoſhold of it.
               
            
            Exit.
            Enters Richard, ſir William Caſbe, Page of his chamber, and his traine.

Firſt note the two houſes of Lancaster and Yorke, the league of friendſhip is yet but greene betwixt them, and little cauſe of variance may cauſe it breake, and thereby I thinke it not requiſite to diſcharge the cōpany becauſe of this.

               Exit.
               Enters the mother Queene, and her daughter, and her ſonne, to ſanctuarie.
               Earle Riuers ſpeakes out of his chamber.
               
                  Ho mine Oſte, Chamberlaine wheres my key?
                  What pend vp like a priſoner? But ſtaie, I feare I am betraid,
                  The ſodain ſight of Gloſters Duke, doth make me ſore afraid:
                  Ile ſpeake to him, and gently him ſalute,
                  Tho in my heart I enuie much the man;
                  
                     God morrow my Lord Protector to your grace,
                  And Duke of Buckingham God morrow too,
                  Thankes noble Dukes for our good cheare, & for your cōpany.

                  Thou wretched Earle, whoſe aged head imagins nought
                  but treacherie,
                  Like Iudas thou admitted waſt to ſup with vs laſt night,
                  But heauens preuented thee our ils, and left thee in this plight:
                  Greeu'ſt thou that I the Gloſter Duke, ſhuld as Protector ſway?
                  And were you he was left behind, to make vs both away?
                  Wilt thou be ringleader to wrōg, & muſt you guide the realme?
                  Nay ouer boord al ſuch mates I hurl, whilſt I do guid the helme:
                  Ile weed you out by one and one, Ile burne you vp like chaffe,

               Riu.
               
                  Alas good Dukes for ought I know, I neuer did offend,
                  Except vnto my Prince vnloyall I haue bene,
                  Then ſhew iuſt cauſe, why you exclaime ſo raſhly in this ſort,
                  So falſly thus me to condemne, vpon ſome falſe report:
                  But am I here as priſoner kept, impriſoned here by you?
                  Then know, I am as true to my Prince, as the proudeſt in thy crue.

                  He hath his tongue as much at vſe, as tho his yeares were yong.

                  When as thy packing with thy Prince, thy falſhood do reueale.
                  A Riuers bluſh, for ſhame to ſpeake, like traitor as thou art.

                  A brayd you me as traitor to your grace:
                  No altho a priſoner, I returne defiance in thy face.
                  The Chronicles I record, talk of my fidelitie, & of my progeny,
                  Wher, as in a glas yu maiſt behold, thy anceſtors & their trechery.
                  The wars in France, Iriſh cōflicts, & Scotland knowes my truſt,
                  When thou haſt kept thy skin vnſcard, and let thine armor ruſt▪
                  
                  How thou vniuſtly here exclaim'ſt,
                  Yea far from loue or kin,
                  Was this the oath which at our princes death,
                  With vs thou didſt combine?
                  
                     But time permits now, to tell thee all my minde:
                  For well tis known that but for fear, you neuer wold haue clind.
                  Let Commons now haue it in hand, the matter is begun,
                  Of whom I feare the leſſer ſort, vpon thy part will run.
                  My Lords, I cannot breath it out in words like to you: but this,
                  My honor I will ſet to ſale, let any comman man come in,
                  And ſay Earle Riuers faith vnto his Prince did quaile,
                  Then will I loſe my lands and life, but if none ſo can doo,
                  Then thou Protector iniur'ſt me, and thy copartner too:
                  But ſince as Iudges here you are, and taking no remorce,
                  Spare me not, let me haue law, in iuſtice do your worſt.
               
            
            
               Buc.
               
                  My Lord, lay down a cooling card, this game is gone too far,
                  You haue him faſt, now cut him off, for feare of ciuill war.
                  Iniurious Earle, I hardly brooke, this portion thou haſt giuen,
                  Thus with my honor me to touch, but thy ruth ſhall begin.

                  But as thou art I leaue thee here,

                  Firſt bare him to Pomphret Caſtle,
                  Charge them to keep him ſecretly:
                  And as you heare from me ſo deale,
                  Let it be done immediatly:
                  Take from our Garriſon one whole band,
                  To guard him thither ſafely.

                  And ſend'ſt thou me to common Iayle?
                  Nay then I know thy minde:
                  God bleſſe theſe yoong and tender babes,
                  That I do leaue behinde.
                  And God aboue protect them day and night,
                  Thoſe are the marks thou aim'ſt at, to rid them from their right.
                  Farewell ſweet England and my country men,
                  Earle Riuers leades the way:
                  Yet would my life might rid you from this thrall,
                  But for my ſtock & kinred to the Queen, I greatly feare thē all.
                  And thus diſloyall Duke farewell, when euer this is knowne,
                  The ſhame and infamy thereof, be ſure will be thine owne.

               So now my Lord of Buckingham, let vs hoyſt vp ſaile while the winde ſerues, this hot beginning muſt haue a quicke diſpatch, therefore I charge and command ſtraightly, that euerie high way be laid cloſe, that none may be ſuffered to carrie this newes before we our ſelues come, for if word come before vs, then is our pretence bewraid, and all we haue done to no effect. If any aske the cauſe why they may not paſſe, vſe my authoritie, and if he reſiſt ſhoote him through. Now my Lord of Buckingham, let vs take poſt horſe to Stony Stratford, where happily ile ſay ſuch grace to the Princes dinner, that I will make the deuouteſt of them forget what meat they eate and yet all for the beſt I hope.
            
            Exit.
            Enter the yoong Prince, Lord Gray, ſir Thomas Vaughon, ſir Richard Hapc and their traine.
            
               Hapc.
               Lord Gray, you do diſcomfort the King by reaſon of your heauineſſe.
            
            
               Gray.
               Alaſſe ſir Richard, how can I be merry when we haue ſo great a charge of his grace: and again this makes me to greeue the more, becauſe wee cannot heare from Earle Riuers, which makes me think the Protector and he haue bene at ſome words.
            
            
               King.
               Why good vnkle comfort your ſelfe, no doubt my vnkle Earle Riuers is well, & is comming no doubt with my vnkle of Gloſter to meete vs, elſe we ſhould haue heard to the contrarie. If any haue cauſe to feare, it is my ſelfe, therfore good vnkle comfort your ſelfe and be not ſad.
            
            
               Gray.
               The ſweete ioyce of ſuch a grape would comfort a man were he halfe dead, and the ſweete words of ſuch a Prince would make men carleſſe of miſhaps, how dangerous ſoeuer.
            
            
               Hap.
               Lord Gray, we heare now by all likelihoods the Protector not to be farre, therefore wee are to entertaine him and the Duke of Buckingham with curteſie, both for the Princes behalfe and for our owne.
            
            
               Gray.
               Sir Richard Hapc, I ſhall hardly ſhew the Protector or the Duke of Buckingham any mery countenance, conſidering how hardly I haue bene vſed by them both, but yet for loue to my prince I wil bridle my affectiō, but in good time they come.
            
            
               Enters Richard, Duke of Buckingham, and their traine.

               King.
               Thankes vnckle of Gloſter for your curteſie, yet you haue made haſt, for we lookt not for you as yet.
            
            
               Rich.
               Therein I ſhew my humble dutie to your grace, whoſe life I wiſh to redouble your deceaſed fathers dayes.
            
            
               King.
               Thankes good vnckle.

               Thankes Buckingham, but vnckle you will beare vs company towards London?
            
            
               Rich.
               For that cauſe we came.

               Gentlemen on afore keep your roomes, how now Lord Gray, doo you iuſtle in the preſence of the King? This is more then needs.
            
            
               Gray.
               My Lord, I ſcarce touched you, I hope it be no offence.
            
            
               Rich.
               Sir no great offence, but inward enuy will burſt out, No Lord Gray, you cannot hide your malice to vs of the Kings blood.
            
            
               King.
               Why good vnckle let me know the cauſe of your ſuddaine quarrell?
            
            
               Rich.
               Marry thus noble Nephew, the old wound of enuy, being rubbed by Lord Grayes venomous raſhneſſe, is growne to ſuch a venomous ſore that it is incurable, without remooue of dead fleſh.
            
            
               Buc.
               Lord Gray, I do ſo much diſlike thy abuſe, that were it not in preſence of the Prince, I would bid thee combate: but thus and it ſhal like your grace, I areſt, & atache this Lord Gray, Sir Thomas Vaughon, and Richard Hapce, of high treaſon to your grace. And that Lord Gray hath conueyed money out of the Tower to relieue our enemies the Scots, and now by currying fauour with your Maieſtie, he thinkes it to be hid.
            
            
               Rich.
               Only this I adde, you gouerne the Prince without my authoritie, allowing me no more then the bare name of Protector, which I wil haue in the diſpight of you, and therfore as your competitor Earle Riuers is alreadie impriſoned, ſo ſhall you be, till time affoord the law to take place.
            
            
               
               Gray.
               But whereas we are atacht as traytors to his grace, and gouerne him without your authoritie, why we haue authoritie from the mother Queene. And for the deliuery of the mony to the Scots, it was done by a generall conſent of you all, and that I haue your hands to ſhew for my diſcharge, therfore your areſt & atachment is not lawfull: & yet as lawful as your quarell is right.
            
            
               Rich.
               Thy preſumption condemnes thee Lord Gray, thy areſt is lawfull. Therefore ſee them ſpeedily and ſecretly impriſoned, and after the coronation they ſhall anſwer it by law, meane while, Officers looke to your charge.
            
            
               King.
               A Gods, and is it iuſtice without my conſent? Am I a King and beare no authoritie? My louing kindred committed to priſon as traytors in my preſence, and I ſtand to giue aime at them. A Edward, would thou laiſt by thy fathers ſide, or elſe he had liued till thou hadſt bin better able to rule. If my neere kindred be committed to priſon, what remains for me, a crowne? A but how? ſo beſet with ſorrows, that the care & grief wil kil me ere I ſhal enioy my kingdome. Well ſince I cannot command, I wil intreat Good vnkle of Gloſter, for all I can ſay little, but for my vnkle Lord Gray, what need he be a theef or conuey money out of the Tower, when he hath ſufficient of his own? But good vnkle let me baile them all: If not, I will baile my vnckle Lord Gray if I may.
            
            
               Rich.
               Your grace vndertakes you know not what, the matters are perillous, eſpecially againſt the Lord Gray.
            
            
               King.
               What perilous matters, conſidering he is a friend to vs?
            
            
               Rich.
               He may be a friend to win fauour, & ſo climbe to promotion in reſpect of his equals. His equals, nay his betters.
            
            
               King.
               I know my vnckle will conceale no treaſon, or dangerous ſeereſie from vs.
            
            
               Ric.
               Yes ſecrets that are too ſubtil for babes, Alaſſe my Lord you are a child, and they vſe you as a child: but they conſult and conclude of ſuch matters, as were we not carefull, would proue preiudiciall to your Maieſties perſon. Therefore let not your grace feare any thing by our determination, for as my authoritie is onely vnder your grace, ſo ſhall my loyaltie deſerue hereafter

the iuſt recompence of a true ſubiect, therefore I hauing charge frō my brother your father, & our late deceaſed king, during the minoritie of your grace, I wil vſe my authoritie as I ſee good.
            
            
               King.
               Ay me vnhappie king.
            
            
               Gray.
               Nay let not your grace be diſmaid for our impriſonmēt, but I would we could warrant your grace from harme, & ſo we humbly take our leaues of your grace, hoping that ere long we ſhall anſwer by law to the ſhame & diſgrace of you all.
            
            Exit.
            
               Rich.
               Go, you ſhall anſwere it by law.

               May it pleaſe your grace to ſhew to your children the cauſe of your heauines, that we knowing it, may be copartners of your ſorrowes.
            
            
               Q.
               Ay me poore husbandles queene, & you poore fatherleſſe princes.
            
            
               Eliz.
               Good mother expect the liuing, and forget the dead. What tho our father be dead, yet behold his children, the image of himſelfe.

               Ay poore Princes, my mourning is for you and for your brother, who is gone vp to an vntimely crownation.
            
            
               Eliz.
               Why mother he is a Prince, and in handes of our two vnckles, Earle Riuers, & Lord Gray, who wil no doubt be carefull of his eſtate.
            
            
               Queen.
               I know they will, but kings haue mortall enemies, as well as friends that eſteeme and regard them. A ſweet children, when I am at reſt my nightly dreames are dreadful. Me thinks as I lie in my bed, I ſee the league broken which was ſworne at the death of your kingly father, tis this my children and many other cauſes of like importance, that makes your aged mother to lament as ſhe doth.

               May it pleaſe your grace.
            
            
               
               Queene.
               A my ſon, no more grace, for I am ſo ſore diſgraced, that without Gods grace, I fall into diſpaire with my ſelfe, but who is this?

               What art thou that with thy gaſtly lookes preaſeth into ſanctuary, to affright our mother Queene.
            
            
               Meſſen
               A ſweet Princes, doth my countenance bewray me? My newes is doubtfull and heauie.
            
            
               Eliz.
               Then vtter it to vs, that our mother may not heare it.
            
            
               Queene.
               A yes my friend, ſpeake what ere it be.
            
            
               Meſſ.
               Then thus may it pleaſe your grace, The yong prince comming vp to his coronation, attended on by his two vnckles, Earle Riuers, and Lord Gray, and the reſt of your kindred, was by the Duke of Buckingham and the Protector, met at ſtonie Stratford, where on a ſuddaine grew malice betweene the Duke of Buckingham and the Lord Gray, but in the end, the Duke of Buckinghams malice grew ſo great, that he areſted and attached all thoſe of your kindred of high treaſon, whereupon the Protector being too raſh in iudgement, hath committed them all to Pomphret Caſtle.
            
            
               Queene.
               Where I feare he will butcher them all, but where is the Prince my ſonne?
            
            
               Meſſen.
               He remaines at London in the Biſhops palace, in the hands of the Protector.
            
            
               Queene.
               A traitors, will they laie hands on their Prince, and impriſon his Peeres, which no doubt meanes well towards him: But tell me, art not thou ſeruant to the Arch-Biſhop of Yorke?
               
            
            
               Meſſen.
               Yes and it pleaſe your grace, for himſelfe is here at hand with Letters from the Councell, and here he comes.

               A come my Lord, thou bringeſt the heauie newes, come ſhoote thine arrow, and hit this heart that is almoſt dead with griefe alreadie.

               What ere my newes be, haue patience, the Duke of Gloſter

greets your grace.
            
            
               Queene.
               Draw home my Lord, for now you hit the marke.

               The Prince your ſonne doth greete your grace.
            
            
               Queene.

               How doth my brother, is he in health my Lord?
            
            
               Card.
               In health ſweete Prince, but longes to haue thy companie.
            
            
               Yorke.
               I am content, if my mother will let me go.
            
            
               Card.
               Content or not, ſweete Prince it muſt be ſo.
            
            
               Queene.
               Hold, and haue they perſuaded thee my ſonne to haue thy brother too away from me, nay firſt I will know what ſhall become of thee, before I ſend my other ſonne to them.
            
            
               Card.
               Looke on this Letter and aduiſe your ſelfe, for thus the Councell hath determined.
            
            
               Queene.
               And haue they choſen thee among the reſt; for to perſuade me to this enterpriſe? No my Lord, and thus perſuade your ſelfe, I will not ſend him to be butchered.
            
            
               Card.
               Your grace miſdoubts the worſt, they ſend for him only to haue him bedfellow to the King, and there to ſtaie & keep him company. And if your ſonne miſcary, then let his blood be laid vnto my charge: I know their drifts and what they do pretend, for they ſhall both this night ſleepe in the Tower, and to morrow they ſhall come forth to his happie cronation. Vpon my honour this is the full effect, for ſee the ambuſht nobles are at hand to take the Prince away from you by force, if you will not by faire meanes let him go.
            
            
               Queene.
               Why my Lord wil you breake Sanctuary, and bring in rebels to affright vs thus? No, you ſhall rather take away my life before you get my boy away from me.
            
            
               Card.
               Why Madame haue you taken Sanctuary?
            
            
               Queene.
               I my Lord, and high time too I trow.
            
            
               Card.
               A heauie caſe when Princes flie for aide, where cutthroates, rebels, and bankerouts ſhould be. But Madame what anſwere do you returne, if I could perſuade you, twere beſt to let him go.
            
            
               
               Queene.
               But for I ſee you counſell for the beſt, I am content that you ſhall haue my ſon, in hope that you will ſend him ſafe to me, here I deliuer him into your hands.
               Farewell my boy, commend me to thy brother.
            
            
               Yorke.

               Why thus by keeping company, am I become like vnto thoſe with whom I keepe company. As my Lorde hopes to weare the Crown, ſo I hope by that means to haue preferment, but in ſteed of the Crowne, the blood of the headles light vpon his head: he hath made but a wrong match, for blood is a threatner and will haue reuenge. He makes hauocke of all to bring his purpoſe to paſſe: all thoſe of the Queens kinred that were committed to Pomphret Caſtle, hee hath cauſed them to be ſecretly put to death without iudgemēt: the like was neuer ſeen in England. He ſpares none whom he but miſtruſteth to be a hinderer to his proceedings, he is ſtraight chopt vp in priſon The valiant Earle of Oxford being but miſtruſted, is kept cloſe priſoner in Hames Caſtle. Againe, how well Doctor Shaw hath pleaſed my Lord, that preached at Paules Croſſe yeſterday, that proued the two Princes to be baſtards, whereupon in the after noone came downe my Lord Mayor and the Aldermen to Baynards Caſtle, and offered my Lord the whole eſtate vpon him, and offered to make him King, which he refuſed ſo faintly, that if it had bene offered once more, I know he would haue taken it, the Duke of Buckingham is gone about it, and is now in the Guild Hall making his Oration. But here comes my Lord.
            
            
            Enter Richard and Catesby.
            
            
               Ric.
               Catesby content thee, I haue warned the Lord Haſtings to this Court, and ſince he is ſo hard to be wonne, tis better to cut him off then ſuffer him, he hath bene all this while partaker to our ſecrets, and if he ſhould but by ſome miſlike vtter it, then were we all caſt away.
            
            
               Cateſ.
               Nay my Lord do as you will, yet I haue ſpoken what I can in my friends cauſe.
            
            
               Rich.
               Goto no more ado Catesby, they ſay I haue bin a long ſleeper to day, but ile be awake anon to ſome of their coſts. But ſirrha are thoſe men in readineſſe that I appointed you to get?

               Goto, looke to it then Catesby, get thee thy weapons readie, for I will enter the Court.

               Pag.
               Doth my Lord ſay he hath bene a long ſleeper to day? There are thoſe of the Court that are of another opinion, that thinks his grace lieth neuer lōg inough a bed. Now there is court held to day by diuerſe of the Councell, which I feare me wil coſt the Lord Haſtings and the Lord Standley their beſt cappes: for my Lord hath willed mee to get halfe a dozen ruffians in readineſſe, and when he knocks with his fiſt vpon the boord, they to ruſh in, and to crie, treaſon, treaſon, and to laie hands vpon the Lord Haſtings, and the Lord Stannley, which for feare I ſhould let ſlip, I will giue my diligent attendance.
            
            Enter Richard, Catesby, and others, pulling Lord Haſtings.

               Come bring him away, let this ſuffice, thou and that accurſed ſorcereſſe the mother Queene hath bewitched me, with aſſiſtance of that famous ſtrumpet of my brothers, Shores wife: my withered arme is a ſufficient teſtimony, deny it if thou canſt: laie not Shores wife with thee laſt night?

               If villain, feedeſt thou me with Ifs & ands, go fetch me a Prieſt, make a ſhort ſhrift, and diſpatch him quickly For by the bleſſed Saint Paule I ſweare, I will not dine till I ſee the

traitors head, away ſir Thomas, ſuffer him not to ſpeak, ſee him executed ſtraight, & let his copartner the Lord Standly be carried to priſon alſo, tis not his broke head I haue giuen him, ſhall exſcues him.
               
                  Exit with Hastings.
               
               Cateſbie goe you and ſee it preſently proclaimed throughout the Citie of London by a Herald of Armes, that the cauſe of his death and the reſt, were for conſpiring by Witchcraft the death▪ of me and the Duke of Buckingham, that ſo they might gouern the King and rule the realme, I thinke the proclamation be almoſt done.

               Well then about it. But heareſt thou Catesbie, meane while I will liſten after ſucceſſe of the Duke of Buckingham, who is labouring all this while with the Citizens of London to make me King, which I hope ſhall be ſhortly, for thou ſeeſt our foes now are fewer, and we neerer the marke then before, and when I haue it, looke thou for the place of thy friend the Lord Haſtings, meane while about thy buſineſſe.

               Now ſirrha to thee, there is one thing more vndone, which grieues me more then all the reſt: and to ſay the truth, it is of more importance then all the reſt.

But my friends ſhould haue preferd diſcipline before affection: for they know of my folly, yea my owne husband knew of my breach of diſloyaltie, and yet ſuffered me, by reaſon hee

knew it bootleſſe to kicke againſt the pricke. A ſweet King Edward, little didſt thou thinke Shores wife ſhould haue bene ſo hardly vſed, thy vnnaturall brother not concent with my goods which are yet confiſcate in his cuſtodie, but yet more to adde to my preſent miſerie, hath proclaimed vpon great penaltie, that none whatſoeuer, ſhall either aide or ſuccour me, but here being comfortleſſe to die in the ſtreets with hunger.

                     •
                   inferiours? Such as are neither nobly borne, nor vertuouſly minded. My heart hardly bewailes the loſſe of the yoong King, by the outrage of the Protector, who hath proclamed himſelfe King, by the name of Richard the third. The Commons murmure at it greatly, that the yoong King and his brother ſhould be impriſoned, but to what end tis hard to ſay, but many think they ſhall neuer come forth againe. But God do all for the beſt and that the right heires may not be vtterly ouerthrowne.
            
            
               Shore.
               A gods what a griefe is it for me to aske, where I haue giuen.
            
            
               Lod.
               A my good Lord Haſtings, how innocently thou diedſt the heauens beare witneſſe.
            
            
               Shores wife.
               Good ſir take pittie vppon mee, and releeue mee.
            
            
               Lod.
               Indeed tis pittie to ſee ſo faire a face to aske for almes; But tell me, haſt thou no friends?
            
            
               Shore.
               Yes ſir I had many frends, but when my chiefeſt friend of all died, the reſt then forſooke me.
            
            
               Lod.
               Belike then thy fact was notorious, that thy f
                     •
                  iends leauing thee would let thee go as a ſpoyle for villaines. But hearſt

thou, I prethie tell me the truth, and as I am a gentleman, I will pittie thee?
            
            
               Shore.
               A Lodowick, tell thee the truth, why halfe this intreatie ſerued thee, when thy lands had bene cleane gone had it not bene for Shores wife, and doeſt thou make me ſo long to begge for a litle.
            
            
               Lod.
               Indeed my lands I had reſtored me by miſtreſſe Shore, but may this be ſhe?
            
            
               Shore.
               I Lodowicke, I am ſhe that begged thy lands of King Edward the fourth, therefore I pray thee beſtow ſomething on me.
            
            
               Lod.
               A gods what is this world, and how vncertaine are riches? Is this ſhe that was in ſuch credit with the King? Nay more, that could command a King indeed? I cannot deny but my lands ſhe reſtored me, but ſhall I by releeuing of her hurt my ſelfe, no: for ſtraight proclamation is made that none ſhall ſuccour her, therefore for feare I ſhould be ſeene talke with her, I will ſhun her company and get me to my chamber, and there ſet downe in heroicall verſe, the ſhameful end of a Kings Concubin, which is no doubt as wonderfull as the deſolation of a kingdome.

               A Lodowick if thou wilt giue me nothing, yet ſtaie and talke with me. A no he ſhuns my company, all my friends now forſake mee: In proſperitie I had many, but in aduerſitie none. A gods haue I this for my good I haue done, for when I was in my cheefeſt pomp, I thought that day wel ſpent wherein I might pleaſure my friend by ſutes to the King, for if I had ſpoken, he would not haue ſaid nay. For tho he was King, yet Shores wife ſwayd the ſwoord. I where neede was, there was I bountifull, and mindfull I was ſtill vppon the poore to releeue them▪ and now none will know me nor ſuccour me: therefore here ſhall I die for want of ſuſtenance. Yet here comes another whom I haue done good vnto in ſauing the life of his ſonne, wel I will trie him, to ſee if he will giue me any thing.

               No men no lawes, no Princes no orders, alls huſht neighbour now hees king, but before he was king how was the tems thwackt with ruffians? what fraies had we in the ſtreets? Now he hath proclaimed peace betweene Scotland and England for ſixe yeares, to what end I know not, vſurpers had neede to be wiſe.

               A neighbour, hedges haue eyes, and high-wayes haue eares, but who iſt a beggar-woman? the ſtreets are full of them, Ifaith. But heeres thou, haſt thou no friendes that thou goeſt a begging ſo?

               Yes ſir I had friends, but they are all dead as you are.

               I meane they are dead in charitie. But I pray ſir, had not you the life of your ſonne ſaued in the time of king Edward▪ the fourth, by one Shores wife?

               Yes mary had I, but art thou a ſprig of the ſame bough? I promiſe you neighbor I thoght ſo, that ſo idle a huſwife could not be without the acquaintance of ſo noble a ſtrumpet: well for her ſake ile giue thee ſomewhat.
            
            
               Shore.
               Nay then know, that I am ſhee that ſaued the life of thy condemned ſonne.
            
            
               Citi.
               Who art thou Shores wife? Lye ſtill purſe, neighbour I would not for twentie pounds haue giuen her one farthing, the proclamation is ſo hard by king Richard. Why minion are you ſhe that was the diſhonour to the King? the ſhame to her huſband, the diſcredit to the Citie? Heare you, laie your fingers to worke, and get thereby ſomewhat to maintaine you. O neighbour I grow verie choloricke, and thou didſt ſaue the life of my▪ ſonne, vvhy if thou hadſt not, another vvould: and for my part, I vvould he had bene hangd ſeuen yeeres ago, it had ſaued me a great deale of mony then. But come let vs go in, & let the quean alone.

               Alaſſe thus am I become an open ſhame to the world, here ſhall I die in the ſtreets for want of ſuſtenance, alaſſe is my fact ſo heinous that none will pitie me? Yet heere comes another to whom I haue done good, who is leaſt able to pleaſure me, yet I will trie him, to ſee if he will giue me any thing.

But this makes me to muſe, the Duke of Bucking ham and the King is at ſuch variance, that did all in all to helpe him to the Crowne, but the Duke of Buckingham is rid downe to Breaknock. Caſtle in Wales, and there he meanes to raiſe vp a power to pull down the vſurper: but let them agree as they will, for the next faire winde ile ouer ſeas.

               A Shores wife, ſo neere driuen, to beg of a ſeruingman, I, neceſſitie hath no law, I muſt needs. Good ſir releeue me, and giue me ſomething.

               Broken.
               Maiſter Terrell, the King hath vvritten, that for one night I ſhould deliuer you the keyes, and put you in full poſſeſſion But good M. Terrell, may I be ſo bold to demand a queſtion vvithout offence?
            
            
               Ter.
               Elſe God forbid, ſay on vvhat ere it be.
            
            
               Bro.
               Then this maiſter Terrell, for your comming I partly▪ knovv the cauſe, for the king oftentimes hath ſent to me to haue them both diſpatcht, but becauſe I vvas a ſeruant to their father being Edvvard the fourth, my heart vvould neuer giue me to do the deed.
            
            
               Ter.
               Why ſir Robert you are beſide the matter, vvhat neede

you vſe ſuch ſpeeches what matters are betweene the King and me, I pray you leaue it, and deliuer me the keyes.

               Ter.
               Alaſſe good ſir Robert, hee is kinde hearted, but it muſt not preuaile, what I haue promiſed the King I muſt performe. But ho Myles Foreſt.
            
            
               For.
               Here ſir.
            
            
               Ter.
               Myles Foreſt, haue you got thoſe men I ſpake of, they muſt be reſolute and pittileſſe.
            
            
               For.
               I warrant you ſir, they are ſuch pittileſſe villaines, that all London cannot match them for their villanie, one of their names is Will Sluter, yet the moſt part calles him blacke Will, the other is Iack Denten, two murtherous villaines that are reſolute.
            
            
               Ter.
               I prethie call them in that I may ſee them, and ſpeake with them.
            
            
               Forest.
               Ho Will and Iack.
            
            
               Well.
               Here ſir, we are at hand.
            
            
               For.
               Theſe be they that I told you of.
            
            
               Ter.
               Come hither ſirs, to make a long diſcourſe were but a folly, you ſeeme to be reſolute in this cauſe that Myles Foreſt hath deliuered to you, therefore you muſt caſt away pitie, & not ſo much as thinke vpon fauour, for the more ſtearne that you are, the more ſhall you pleaſe the King.
            
            
               Will.
               Zownes ſir, nere talke to vs of fauour, tis not the firſt that Iack and I haue gone about.
            
            
               Ter.
               Well ſaid, but the Kings pleaſure is this, that he wil haue no blood ſhead in the deed doing, therefore let me heare your aduiſes?
            
            
               For.
               Why then I thinke this maiſter Terrell, that as they ſit at ſupper there ſhould be two dags readie charged, and ſo ſuddeinly to ſhoote them both through.
            
            
               Terrell.
               No, I like not that ſo well, what ſaieſt thou Will, what is thy opinion?
            
            
               
               Well.
               Tuſh, heeres more adoo then needes, I pray bring mee where they are, and ile take them by the heeles and beate their braines againſt the walles.
            
            
               Ter.
               Nay that I like not, for tis too tyrannous.
            
            
               Dout.
               Then heare me maiſter Terrell, let Will take one, and ile take another, and by the life of Iack Douton weele cut both their throates.
            
            
               Ter.
               Nay ſirs, then heare me, I will haue it it done in this order, when they be both a bed and at reſt, Myles Foreſt thou ſhalt bring them vp both, and betweene two feather beds ſmother them both.
            
            
               For.
               Why this is verie good, but ſtand aſide, for here comes the Princes, ile bring you word when the deed is done.
            
            Exit. Terrill.
            Enter the Princes.
            
               Yorke.
               How fares my noble Lord and louing brother?
            
            
               King.
               A worthie brother, Richard Duke of Yorke, my cauſe of ſorrow is not for my ſelfe, but this is it that addes my ſorrow more, to ſee our vnckle whom our father left as our Protector in minoritie, ſhould ſo digreſſe from dutie, loue and zeale, ſo vnkindly thus to keepe vs vp priſoners, and know no ſufficient cauſe for it.
            
            
               Yorke.
               Why brother comfort your ſelfe, for tho he detaine vs a while, he will not keepe vs long, but at laſt he will ſend vs to our louing mother againe: whither if it pleaſe God to ſend vs, I doubt not but our mother would keepe vs ſo ſafe, that all the Prelates in the worlde ſhould not depriue her of vs againe: ſo much I aſſure my ſelfe of. But here comes Myles Foreſt, I prethy Myles tell my kingly brother ſome mery ſtorie to paſſe away the time, for thou ſeeſt he is melancholy.
            
            
               King.
               No Myles, tell me no mery ſtorie, but anſwere me to one queſtion, vvhat vvas he that vvalked vvith thee in the Gardeine, me thought he had the keyes?
            
            
               For.
               My Lord, it vvas one that vvas appointed by the King o be an ayde to ſir Thomas Brokenbury.
            
            
               King.
               Did the King, vvhy Myles Foreſt, am not I King?
            
            
               
               For.
               I would haue ſaid my Lord your vnckle the Protector.
            
            
               King.
               Nay my kingly vnckle I know he is now, but let him enioy both Crowne and kingdome, ſo my brother and I may but enioy our liues and libertie. But tell me, is ſir Robert Brokenbery cleane diſcharged?
            
            
               For.
               No my Lord, he hath but charge for a night or two.

               Why you baſe ſlaue, are you faint hearted, a little thing would make me ſtrike thee, I promiſe thee.

               But ho ſirs, come ſoftly, for now they are at reſt.

               Ah villain, thou betraiedſt me for lucre, and not for dutie to thy Prince, why Baniſter, a good ſeruant thinkes his life well ſpent, that ſpends it in the quarrel of his maiſter. But villain make thy ſelfe readie, and here receiue thy death.

               Well Herald, I will obey thy reſt. But am I arreſted in King Richardes name, vſurping Richard, that inſatiate blood ſuccour, that traitor to God & man. Ah Richard, did I in Guild-Hall pleade the Orator for thee, and held thee in all thy ſlie and wicked practiſes, and for my reward doeſt thou alot me death? Ah Buckingham, thou plaidſt thy part and made him King, and put the lawfull heires beſides: why then is Buckingham guiltie now of his death? yet had not the Biſhop of Ely fled, I had eſcaped.

Ah Buckingham, was not thy meaning good in diſplacing the vſurper, to raiſe a lawfull king? Ah Buckingham, it was too late, the lawfull heires were ſmothered in the Tower, ſweet Edward and thy brother, I nere ſlept quiet thinking of your deaths. But vaunt Buckingham, thou waſt altogither innocent of their deaths. But thou vilain, whom of a child I nurſt thee vp, and haſt ſo vniuſtly betraied thy Lorde? Let the curſe of Buckingham nere depart from thee. Let vengeance, miſchiefes, tortures, light on thee and thine. And after death thou maiſt more torture feele, then when Excon turnes the reſtleſſe wheele. And banne thy ſoule where ere thou ſeeme to reſt. But come my my friends, let me away.

               King.
               
                  The goale is got, and golden Crowne is wonne,

                  That ventured haſt thy bodie and thy ſoule,
                  But what bootes Richard, now the Diademe
                  Or kingdome got, by murther of his friends,
                  My fearefull ſhadow that ſtill followes me,
                  Hath ſommond me before the ſeuere iudge,
                  My conſcience witneſſe of the blood I ſpilt,
                  Accuſeth me as guiltie of the fact,
                  The fact, a damned iudgement craues,
                  Whereas impartiall iuſtice hath condemned.
                  Meethinkes the Crowne which I before did weare,
                  
                     Inchaſt with Pearle and coſtly Diamonds,
                  Is turned now into a fatall wreathe,
                  Of fiery flames, and euer burning ſtarres,
                  And raging fiends hath paſt ther vgly ſhapes,
                  In ſtudient lakes, adreſt to tend on me,
                  If it be thus, what wilt thou do in this extremitie?
                  Nay what canſt thou do to purge thee of thy guilt?
                  Euen repent, craue mercie for thy damned fact,
                  Appeale for mercy to thy righteous God,
                  Ha repent, not I, craue mercy they that liſt.
                  My God, is none of mine. Then Richard be thus reſolu'd,

               It may be ſo. But what thinkſt thou Catesbie?
            
            
               Cat.
               Of what my Lord?
            
            
               King.
               Why of all theſe troubles.

               Why my Lord, I hope to ſee them happily ouercom'd.
            
            
               King.
               How villain, doeſt thou hope to ſee me happily ouercom'd?
            
            
               Cat.
               Who you my Lord?
            
            
               King.
               Ay villaine, thou points at me, thou hopeſt to ſee me ouercom'd.
            
            
               Cat.
               No my good Lord, your enemies or elſe not.

               Why he is dead my Lord, he was executed at Salisbury yeſterday.
            
            
               King.
               Why tis impoſſible, his friends hopes that he ſhall outline me, to be my head.
            
            
               Cat.
               Out-liue you, Lord thats ſtraunge.
            
            
               King.
               
                  No Catesbie, if a do, it muſt be in fames,
                  And ſince they hope he ſhall out liue me, to be my head,
                  He hops without his head, & reſts among his fellow rebels.
               
            
            
               Cat.
               Mary no force my Lord.
            
            
               King.
               But Catesbie, what heareſt thou of Henry Earle of Richmond?
               
            
            
               
               Cat.
               Not a word my Lord.
            
            
               King.
               
                  No: heareſt thou not he liues in Brittaine,
                  
                  In fauour with the Duke.
                  Nay more, Lady Margaret his mother conſpires againſt vs,
                  And perſwades him that hee is lineally deſcended from Henry
                  The fourth, and that he hath right to the Crowne,
                  Therefore tell me what thinkſt thou of the Earle?
               
            
            
               Cat.
               My Lord, I thinke of the Earle as he doth deſerue, A moſt famous gentleman.
            
            
               King.
               Villaine doeſt thou praiſe my foe, and commend him to my face?
            
            
               Cat.
               Nay my Lord, I wiſh he were as good a friend as he is a foe, elſe the due deſerts of a traytor.
            
            
               King.
               Whats that?
            
            
               Cat.
               Why my Lord, to looſe his head.
            
            
               King.
               
                  Yea mary, I would twere off quickly, then
                  But more to the ſtrengthening of his title,
                  She goes about to marry him to the Queenes eldeſt daughter,
                  Ladie Elizabeth.
               
            
            
               Cat.
               
                  Indeed my Lord that I heard was concluded,
                  By all the nobilitie of Brittaine.
                  
               
            
            
               King.
               
                  Why then there it goes,
                  The great diuell of hell go with all.
                  A marriage begun in miſchiefe, ſhall end in blood:
                  I thinke that accurſed ſorrereſſe the mother Queene,
                  Doth nothing but bewith me, and hatcheth conſpiracies,
                  And brings out perillous birds to wound
                  Their Countries weale,
                  The Earle is vp in Armes,
                  And with him many of the Nobilitie,
                  He hath ayde in France,
                  
                  He is reſcued in Brittaine,
                  
                  And meaneth ſhortly to arriue in England:
                  But all this ſpites me not ſo much,
                  As his eſcape from Landoyſe the Dukes Treaſuror,
                  Who if he had bene prickt foorth for reuenge,
                  
                     He had ended all by apprehending of our foe,
                  But now he is in diſgrace with the Duke,
                  And we farther off our purpoſe then to fore,
                  But the Earle hath not ſo many byting dogs abroad,
                  As we haue ſleeping curres at home here,
                  Readie for reſcue.
               
            
            
               Cat.
               
                  But my Lord, I maruell how he ſhould get aide there,
                  Conſidering he is no friend to Brittaine.
                  
               
            
            
               King.
               
                  Ay ſo thou maiſt maruell how the Duke of Brittaine,
                  
                  Durſt wake ſuch a foe as England againſt him,
                  But euill fare makes open warre.
                  But who comes there Catsbie?
                  Ha one of our ſpurres to reuenge:
                  The Lord Standley, father in law to Ladie Margaret,
                  His comming is to vs Catsbie,
                  Wert not that his life might ſerue,
                  For apprehenſion againſt our foe,
                  He ſhould haue neither Iudge nor Iury,
                  But guiltie death without any more ado.
                  Now Lord Standley, what newes?
                  Haue you receiued any letters of your late embaſſage into
                  
                     Brittaine? What anſwere haue you receiued of your letters?
               
            
            Enter Lord Standley, and his ſonne George.
            
            
               Stand.
               Why my Lord, for that I ſent, I haue receiued.
            
            
               King.
               And how doth your ſonne then, is he in health?
            
            
               Standley.
               For his health my Lord, I do not miſtruſt.
            
            
               King.
               
                  Faith tell vs, when meanes he to arriue in England?
                  And how many of our Nobilitie is with him?
                  And what power is with him?
               
            
            
               Standley.
               
                  And pleaſe your grace,
                  His power is vnknowne to me,
                  Nor willingly would not I be priuy to ſuch cauſes.
               
            
            
               King.
               Oh good wordes Lord Standley, but giue

me leaue to gleane out of your golden field of eloquence, how braue you pleade ignorance▪ as though you knew not of your ſonnes departure into Brittaine out of England.
            
            
               Stand.
               Not I my Lord.
            
            
               King.
               Why is not his mother thy wife, & dares he paſſe ouer without the bleſſing of his mother, whoſe husband thou art?
            
            
               Stand.
               I deſire your maieſtie but giue me leaue to ſpeake?
            
            
               King.
               Yea ſpeak Standley, no doubt ſome fine coloured tale,
            
            
               Stand.
               And like your grace, wheras you miſtruſt that I knew of my ſonnes departure, out of England into Brittaine, God I take to record it was vnknowne to me, nor know not yet what his pretence is: for at his departure, was I one of the priuy councell to your brother King Edward the fourth, and that ſhe was able to relieue him without my helpe: I hope her ſufficiencie is knowne to your grace. Therefore I humbly craue pardon.
            
            
               King.
               Well Standley, I feare it will be proued to the contrarie, that thou didſt furniſh him both with mony and munition, which if it be, then looke for no fauour at my hands, but the due deſerts of a traitor: but let this paſſe. Whats your repaire to our preſence?
            
            
               Stan.
               Only this my Lord, that I may repaire from the court, to my houſe in the country.
            
            
               King.
               Ay ſir, that you might be in Cheſhire and Lancaſhire, then ſhould your Poſtes paſſe inuiſible into Brittaine, and you to depart the realme at your pleaſure, or elſe I to ſuffer an intollerable foe vnder me, which I will not. But Standley to be brief, thou ſhalt not go. But ſoft Richard, but that it were better to be alone then to haue noyſome company, he ſhall goe, leauing for his loyaltie a ſufficient pledge. Come hither Standley, thou ſhalt goe, leauing me here thy ſonne and heire George Standley for a pledge, that hee may periſh for thy fault if neede ſhould be, if thou likeſt this, goe, If not, anſwere me briefly, and ſay quickly no.
            
            
               Stand.
               I am to aduiſe my ſelfe vppon a ſecret cauſe, and of a matter that concernes me neare: ſay that I leaue my ſonne vnto the King, and that I ſhould but aide Earle Richmond, my ſonne

George Standley dies, but if my faith be kept vnto my Prince, George Standley liues. Well I will except the Kings proffer. And pleaſe your grace I am content, and will leaue my ſonne▪ to pledge.
            
            
               King.
               
                  Here come hither, and with thee take this leſſon.
                  Thou art ſet free for our defence,
                  Thou ſhalt vpon thy pledge make this promiſe,
                  Not only to ſtaie the hinderance of the Earle,
                  But to preuent his purpoſe with thy power.
                  Thou ſhalt not ſeeke by any meanes to aide or reſcue him.
                  This done, of my life thy ſonne doth liue:
                  But otherwiſe thy ſonne dies and thou too; if I catch thee:
                  And it ſhall go hard but I will catch thee.
               
            
            
               Stand.
               And you ſhall go apace, and yet go without me. But I humbly take my leaue of your grace. Farewell George.
            
            
               King.
               How now, what do you giue him letters?
            
            
               Stand.
               No my Lord, I haue done: The ſecond ſight is ſweet, of ſuch a ſonne.
            
            Exit.
            
               King.
               Carry George Standley to priſon.
            
            
               George.
               Alaſſe my Lord, ſhall I go to priſon?
            
            
               King.
               
                  Shall you go to priſon, what a queſtions that?
                  So pricke the lambe, and wound the damme.
                  How likeſt thou this Catesbie?
               
            
            
               Cat.
               Oh my Lord ſo excellent, that you haue impriſoned his ſonne.
            
            
               King.
               
                  Nay now will we looke to the reſt,
                  But I ſent the Lord Louell to the mother Queene,
                  Concerning my ſute to her daughter Elizabeth,
                  But ſee in good time here he is.
                  How now Louell, what newes?
                  What ſaith the mother Queene to my ſute?
               
            
            Enters Louell.
            
            
               Lou.
               
                  My Lord very ſtrange ſhe was at the firſt,
                  But when I had told her the cauſe, ſhe gaue concent:
                  Deſiring your maieſtie to make the nobilitie priuie to it.
               
            
            
               
               King.
               God haue mercy Louell, but what ſaid Lady Elizabeth▪
               
            
            
               Lou.
               Why my Lord, ſtraunge, as women will be at the firſt▪ But through intreatie of her mother, ſhe quickly gaue conſent▪ And the Queene wild me to tel your grace, that ſhe meanes to leaue Sanctuary, and to come to the court with al her daughters.
            
            
               King.
               I marry Louell let not that opportunitie ſlippe, looke to it Catesbie, be carefull for it Louell, for thereby hangs ſuch a chance, that may inrich vs and our heires for euer. But ſirs hard ye nothing of the Scottiſh Nobles that met at Nottingham, to conferre about the marriage of my Neece.
            
            
               Cat.
               Not a word my Lord.
            
            Enters Meſſenger.
            
               King.

               Meſſ.
               No my Lord I haue none.
            
            
               King.
               From whence comes thou?
            
            
               Meſſ.
               From the Peeres at Nottingham and Scotland, & they greete your Maieſtie.
            
            
               Lou.
               Sirrha is the marriage concluded betweene the Scottiſh Earle and the faire Lady Roſa.
               
            
            
               Cat.
               Prethie tell vs, is it concluded?

               How ſaies thou, is it concluded?
            
            
               King.
               Nay will you giue me leaue to tell you that? Why you villaines will you know the ſecrets of my letter by interrupting meſſengers that are ſent to me? Away I ſay, begone, it is time to looke about: away I ſay, what here yet villaines?
            
            
               Meſſ.
               My Lord, I haue ſomewhat to ſay beſides?
            
            
               King.
               Then ſpeake it, what haſt thou to ſay?
            
            
               Meſſ.
               This my Lord, when the Peeres of England and Scotland met at Nottingham togither, to confer about the marriage of your Neeſe, it was ſtraight determined that ſhe ſhuld be married with the Scottiſh Earle. And further my Lord, the Councel commanded me to deliuer vnto your grace the treaſons of Captain Blunt, who had the Earle of Oxford in charge in Hames caſtle, now are they both fled, and purpoſeth to ayde the Earle of Richmond againſt your grace. Now my Lord I take my leaue.
            
            
               
               King.
               Meſſenger ſtaie, hath Blunt betraied, doth Oxford rebell and aide the Earle Richmond, may this be true, what is our priſon ſo weake, our friends ſo fickle, our Ports ſo ill lookt too, that they may paſſe and repaſſe the ſeas at their pleaſures, then euerie one conſpires, ſpoyles our Conflex, conqueres our Caſtles, and Armes themſelues with their owne weapons vnreſiſted? O villaines, rebels, fugetiues, theeues, how are we betrayd, when our owne ſwoordes ſhall beate vs, and our owne ſubiects ſeekes the ſubuertion of the ſtate, the fall of their Prince, and ſack of their country, of his, nay neither muſt nor ſhall, for I will Army with my friends, and cut off my enemies, & beard them to their face that dares me, and but one, I one, one beyond the ſeas that troubles me: wel his power is weake, & we are ſtrong, therfore I wil meet him with ſuch melodie, that the ſinging of a bullet ſhal ſend him merily to his lōgeſt home. Come folow me.
            
            Enter Earle Rich. Earle Oxford, P. Landoys, & captain Blunt.
            
            
               Rich.
               
                  Welcome deare friends and louing country-men,
                  Welcome I ſay to Englands blisfull Ile,
                  Whoſe forwardneſſe I cannot but commend,
                  That thus do aide vs in our enterpriſe,
                  My right it is, and ſole inheritance,
                  And Richard but vſurps in my authoritie,
                  For in his tyrannie he ſlaughtered thoſe
                  That would not ſuccour him in his attempts,
                  Whoſe guiltleſſe blood craues daily at Gods hands;
                  Reuenge for outrage done to their harmeleſſe liues:
                  Then courage countrymen, and neuer be diſmayd,
                  Our quarels good, and God will helpe the right,
                  For we may know by dangers we haue paſt,
                  That God no doubt will giue vs victorie.
               
            
            
               Oxf.
               
                  If loue of gold, or feare of many foes,
                  Could once haue danted vs in our attempts,
                  Thy foote had neuer toucht the Engliſh ſhoare,
                  And here Earle Oxford plites his faith to thee,
                  Neuer to leaue in what we haue vndertane,
                  But follow ſtill with reſolution,
                  
                     Till thou be crownd as conquerer in the field,
                  Or loſe thy life in following of thy right:
                  Thy right braue Richmond, which we wil maintaine
                  Maugre the proudeſt bird of Richards brood.
                  Then couſin Richmond being reſolued thus,
                  Let vs ſtraight to Aarms, & God and S. George for vs.
               
            
            
               Blunt.
               
                  As this braue Earle haue ſaid, ſo ſay we all,
                  We will not leaue thee till the field be wonne,
                  Which if with fortunate ſucceſſe we can performe,
                  Thinke then Earle Richmond that I followed thee,
                  And that ſhall be honour inough for mee.
               
            
            
               Lan.
               
                  So ſaith Landoyſe that honors Richmond ſo
                  With loue vnfeined for his valure paſt,
                  That if your honour leade the way to death,
                  Peeter Landoys hath ſworne to follow thee.
                  For if Queen mother do but keep her word,
                  And what the Peeres haue promiſed be performed,
                  Touching the marriage with Elizabeth,
                  Daughter to our King Edward the fourth,
                  And by this marriage ioyne in vnitie
                  Thoſe famous Houſes Lancaſhire and Yorke,
                  
                  Then England ſhall no doubt haue cauſe to ſay,
                  Edwards coronation was a ioyfull day.
                  And tis is all Landoys deſires to ſee.
               
            
            
               Richm.
               
                  Thanks Landoys, and here Earle Richmonds vows,
                  If their kinde promiſes take but effect,
                  That as they haue promiſed I be made King,
                  I will ſo deale in gouerning the ſtate,
                  Which now lies like a ſauage ſhultred groue,
                  Where brambles, briars, and thornes, ouer-grow thoſe ſprigs,
                  Which if they might but ſpring to their effect,
                  And not be croſt ſo by their contraries,
                  Making them ſubiect to theſe outrages,
                  Would proue ſuch members of the Common-weale,

                  Which was his garriſon at Milford Hauen,
                  Shall we diſmay, or dant our friends to come?
                  Becauſe he tooke the Duke of Buckingham?
                  No worthie friends, and louing country-men,
                  Oxford did neuer beare ſo baſe a minde,
                  He will not winke at murthers ſecretly put vp,
                  Nor ſuffer vpſtarts to enioy our rightes,
                  Nor liue in England vnder an vſurping king,

               My friend, my mother hath written to me of certaine that are comming in our aide, the report of whoſe names are referd to thee to deliuer.

               Rich.
               Doth Arnoll Butler come, I can hardly brooke his trecherie, for hee it was that wrought my diſgrace with the King.
            
            
               Oxf.
               Well my Lord, wee are now to ſtrengthen our ſelues with friends, and not to reape vp olde quarrels, ſay that Arnoll Butler did iniurie you in the time of peace, the mendes is twiſe made, if he ſtand with you in the time of warres.
            
            
               Rich.
               
                  Well my friend, take this for thy good newes,
                  And commend me to our mother and the reſt.
                  Thus my Lords, you ſee God ſtill prouides for vs:
                  But now my Lords touching the placing of our battell beſt,

                  A place I know which you will well deſerue,

                  Shall by in quarters, as our battels ſcowtes,

                  As alſo when that our promiſed friends do come,
                  Then muſt you hold hard skirmiſh with our foes,
                  Till I by caſt of a counter march,
                  Haue ioynd our power with thoſe that come to vs,
                  Then caſting cloſe, as wings on either ſide,
                  We will giue a new prauado on the foe,
                  Therefore let vs towards Aderſtoe amaine,
                  Where we this night God-willing will incampe,
                  From thence towards Lichfield, we will march next day,
                  And neerer London, bid King Richard play.

                  For now he hath obtaind the Diademe,
                  But with ſuch great diſcomfort to his minde,
                  That he had better liued a priuate man, his lookes are gaſtly,
                  Hidious to behold, and from the priuie ſentire of his heart,
                  There comes ſuch deepe fetcht ſighes and fearefull cries,
                  That being with him in his chamber oft,
                  He mooues me weepe and ſigh for company,
                  For if he heare one ſtirre he riſeth vp,
                  And claps his hand vpon his dagger ſtraight,
                  Readie to ſtab him, what ſo ere he be,
                  But he muſt thinke this is the iuſt reuenge,
                  The heauens haue powred vpon him for his ſinnes,
                  Thoſe Peeres which he vnkindly murthered,
                  Doth crie for iuſtice at the hands of God,

               A Richard, now do my eyes witneſſe that thy end is at hand, For thy commons make no more account of thee then of a priuate man, yet will I as dutie bindes, giue thee aduertiſements of their vniuſt proceedings. My maiſter hath lifted out many, and yet hath left one to lift him out of all, not onely of his Crowne, but alſo of his life. But I will in, to tell my Lord of what is happened.

               Good my Lord depart, and leaue me to my ſelfe.

               I pray my Lord, let me go along with you.

               My Lord it may not be, for I haue promiſed my father that none ſhall come but my ſelfe, therfore good my Lord depart.
            
            
               Oxf.
               Good my Lord haue a care of your ſelf, I like not theſe night walkes and ſcouting abroad in the euenings ſo diſguiſed, for you muſt not now that you are in the vſurpers dominions, and you are the onely marke he aimes at, and your laſt nightes abſence bred ſuch amazement in our ſouldiers, that they like men wanting the power to follow Armes, were on a ſodaine more liker to flie then to fight: therefore good my Lorde, if I may not ſtand neare, let me ſtand aloofe off.
            
            
               Rich.
               Content thee good Oxford, and tho I confeſſe my ſelf bound to thee for thy eſpeciall care, yet at this time I pray thee hold me excuſed. But farewell my Lord, heere comes my Lord and father.

               How fares my gratious Lord and father?
            
            
               Stan.
               In good health my ſonne, & the better to ſee thee thus foreward in this laudable enterpriſe, but omitting vain circumſtances, and to come briefly to the purpoſe, I am now in fewe words to deliuer much matter. For know this, when I came to craue leaue of the King to depart from the court, the king verie furiouſly began to charge me that I was both acquainted with thy practiſes and drifts, and that I knew of thy landing, and by no meanes would grant me leaue to go, till as pledge of my loyaltie and true dealing with the king, I ſhould leaue my yoong ſonne George Standley. Thus haue I left my ſon in the hands of a tyrant, onely of purpoſe to come and ſpeake with thee.
            
            
               Rich.
               But omitting this, I pray tell me, ſhall I looke for your helpe in the battell?
            
            
               Stan.
               Sonne I cannot, for as I will not goe to the vſurper, no

more I will not come to thee.
            
            
               Rich.
               Why then it is bootleſſe for vs to ſtaie, for all we preſumed vpon, was on your aide.
            
            
               Stan.
               Why ſonne, George Standlyes death would doo you no pleaſure.
            
            
               Rich.
               Why the time is too troubleſome, for him to tend to follow execution.
            
            
               Stan.
               O ſonne, tyrants expect no time, and George Standley being yoong and a griſſell, is the more eaſie to be made away.
            
            
               Rich.
               This newes goes to my heart, but tis in vaine for mee to looke for victorie, when with a mole-hill, we ſhall encounter with a mountaine.
            
            
               Stand.
               Why ſonne, ſee how contrarie you are, for I aſſure you, the chiefeſt of his company are liker to flie to thee, then to fight againſt thee: and for me, thinke me not ſo ſimple but that I can at my pleaſure flie to thee, or being with them, fight ſo faintly, that the battell ſhall be wonne on thy part with ſmall incountring. And note this beſides, that the King is now come to Leſter, and means to morrow to bid thee battel in Boſworth.

               Stand.
               Why then ſonne farewell, I can ſtaie no longer.
            
            
               Richm.
               
                  Yet good father, one word more ere you depart,
                  What number do you thinke the kings power to be?
               
            
            
               Stand.
               Mary ſome twentie thouſand. And ſo farewell.
            
            
               Richm.
               And we hardly fiue thouſand, being beſet with many enemies, hoping vpon a few friends, yet diſpair not Richmond, but remember thou fighteſt in right, to defende thy countrey from the tyrannie of an vſurping tyrant, therefore Richmond goe foreward, the more dangerous the battell is in atteining, it prooues the more honourable being obteined. Then forward Richmond, God and ſaint George, for me.

                  The hell of life that hangs vpon the Crowne,
                  The daily cares, the nightly dreames,
                  The wretched crewes, the treaſon of the foe,
                  And horror of my bloodie practiſe paſt,
                  Strikes ſuch a terror to my wounded conſcience,
                  That ſleepe I, wake I, or whatſoeuer I do,
                  Meethinkes their ghoaſts comes gaping for reuenge,
                  Whom I haue ſlaine in reaching for a Crowne.
                  Clarence complaines, and crieth for reuenge.
                  My Nephues bloods, Reuenge, reuenge, doth crie.
                  The headleſſe Peeres comes preaſing for reuenge.
                  And euery one cries, let the tyrant die.
                  The Sunne by day ſhines hotely for reuenge.
                  The Moone by night eclipſeth for reuenge.
                  The ſtars are turnd to Comets for reuenge.
                  The Planets chaunge their courſies for reuenge.
                  The birds ſing not, but ſorrow for reuenge.
                  The ſilly lambes ſits bleating for reuenge.
                  The ſcreeking Rauen ſits croking for reuenge.
                  Whole heads of beaſts comes bellowing for reuenge.
                  And all, yea all the world I thinke,
                  Cries for reuenge, and nothing but reuenge.
                  But to conclude, I haue deſerued reuenge.
                  In company I dare not truſt my friend,
                  Being alone, I dread the ſecret foe:
                  I doubt my foode, leaſt poyſon lurke therein.
                  My bed is vncoth, reſt refraines my head.
                  Then ſuch a life I count far worſe to be,
                  Then thouſand deaths vnto a damned death:
                  How waſt death I ſaid? who dare attempt my death?
                  Nay who dare ſo much as once to thinke my death?
                  Though enemies there be that would my body kill,
                  Yet ſhall they leaue a neuer dying minde.
                  But you villaines, rebels, traitors as you are,
                  How came the foe in, preaſing ſo neare?
                  
                     Where, where, ſlept the garriſon that ſhould a beat them back?
                  Where was our friends to intercept the foe?
                  All gone, quite fled, his loyaltie quite laid a bed?
                  Then vengeance, miſchiefe, horror, with miſchance,
                  Wilde-fire, with whirle winds, light vpon your heads,
                  That thus betrayd your Prince by your vntruth.
               
            
            
               King.
               Frantike man, what meanſt thou by this mood? Now he is come more need to beate him backe.

               The bad rebellion of my foe is not ſo much, as for to ſee my friends do flie in flockes from me.

               His trecherous father hath neglect his word and done imparſhall paſt by dint of ſword, therefore ſirrha go fetch him, Zownes draw you cuts who ſhall go, I bid you go Catesby. A Richard, now maiſt thou ſee thy end at hand, why ſirs why fear you thus? why we are ten to one, if you ſeeke promotion, I am a King alreadie in poſſeſſion, better able to performe then he.

               We will my Lord, a Catesbie, thou lookeſt like a dog, and thou Louell too, but you will runne away with them that be gone, and the diuel go with you all, God I hope, God, what talke I of God, that haue ſerued the diuell all this while. No, fortune and courage for mee, and ioyne England againſt mee with England, Ioyne Europe with Europe, come Chriſtendome, and with Chriſtendome the whole world, and yet I will neuer yeeld but by death onely. By death, no die, part not childiſhly from thy Crowne, but come the diuell to claime it, ſtrike him down, & tho that Fortune hath decreed, to ſet reuenge with triumphs on my wretched head, yet death, ſweete death, my lateſt friend, hath ſworne to make a bargaine for my laſting fame, and this, I this verie day, I hope with this lame hand of mine, to rake out that hatefull heart of Richmond, and when I haue it, to eate it panting hote with ſalt, and drinke his blood luke warme, tho I

be ſure twil poyſon me. Sirs you that be reſolute follow me, the reſt go hang your ſelues.

And how the battell fell then knowe Report, that Richard came to fielde mounted on horsback, with as high reſolue as fierce Achillis mongſt the ſturdie Greekes, whom to encounter worthie Richmond, came accompanied with many followers, and then my Lord diſplayde his colours ſtraight, and with the charge of Trumpet, Drum, and Fyfe, theſe braue batalians ſtraight encountred, but in the skirmiſh which cōtinued long, my Lord gan faint, which Richmond ſtraight perceiued, and preſently did ſound afreſh alarme, but worthie Richard that did neuer flie, but followed honour to the gates of death, ſtraight ſpurd his horſe to encounter with the Earle, in which encountry Richmond did preuaile, & taking Richard at aduantage, then he threw his horſe and him both to the ground, and there was woorthie Richard wounded, ſo that after that he nere recouered ſtrength. But to be briefe, my maiſter would not yeeld, but with his loſſe of life he loſt the field. Report farewell.

               Rich.
               Now noble Peeres and woorthie country-men, ſince God hath giuen vs fortune of the day, let vs firſt giue thankes vnto his Deitie, & next with honors fitting your deſerts, I muſt be gratefull to my country men, and woorthie Oxford for thy ſeruice ſhowne in hote encountring of the enemy, Earle Richmond bindes himſelfe in laſting bondes of faithfull loue & perfect vnitie. Sory I am for thoſe that I haue loſt by our ſo dangerous encountring with the foe, but ſorow cannot bring the dead to life: and therefore are my ſorrows ſpent in vaine. Onely to thoſe that liue, thus much I ſay, I will maintain them with a manuall paie. And louing father, laſtly to your ſelf, tho not the leaſt in our expected aide, we giue more thankes for your vnlooked for aide, then we haue power on ſodaine to declare, but for your thanks I hope it ſhall ſuffiſe that I in nature loue & honor you.

               Well ſpoken ſonne, and like a man of worth, whoſe reſolutiō in this battell paſt, hath made thee famous mongſt thy enemies. And thinke my ſon, I glory more to heare what praiſe the common people gaue of thee, then if the Peeres by general full conſent had ſet me downe to weare the Diadem. Then liue my ſonne thus loued of thy friends, and for thy foes prepare to combate them.

               Rich.
               No louely Queene your ſonne doth liue in France, for being diſtreſt and driuen by force of tempeſt to that ſhore, and many of our men being ſicke and dead, we were inforſt to aske the King for aide, as well for men as for munition, which then the King did willingly ſupply, prouided, that as hoſtage for thoſe men, Lord Marqueſſe Dorſet ſhould be pledge with thē. But Madame now our troubled warre is done, Lord Marqueſſe Dorſet ſhall come home againe.

               Richmond, gramercies for thy kinde good newes, which is no little comfort to thy friends, to ſee how God hath beene thy happie guide in this late conqueſt of our enemies. And Richmond, as thou art returned with victorie, ſo we will keepe our words effectually.

               Then Madame for our happie battelles victorie, firſt thankes to heauen, next to my foreward country-men, but Madame pardon me tho I make bold to charge you with a promiſe that you made, which was confirmed by diuerſe of the Peeres, touching the marriage of Elizabeth, and hauing ended what I promiſed you, Madam, I looke and hope to haue my due.
            
            
               Stand.
               Then know my ſonne, the Peeres by full conſent, in that thou haſt freed them from a tyrants yoke, haue by election choſen thee as King, firſt in regard they account thee vertuous, next, for that they hope all forraine broyles ſhall ceaſe, and thou wilt guide and gouerne them in peace, then ſit thou downe my ſonne, and here receiue the Crowne of England as thy proper owne, ſit downe.

               Thanks louing friends and my kind country-men, and here I vow in preſence of you all, to root abuſes from this common welth, which now flowes faſter then the furious tyde that ouerflowes beyond the bankes of Nile. And louing father, and my other friends, whoſe ready forwardneſſe hath made me fortunate, Richmond will ſtill in honourable loue count himſelfe to be at your diſpoſe, nor do I wiſh to enioy a longer life, then I ſhall liue to thinke vpon your loue. But what ſaith faire Elizabeth to vs? for now wee haue welcommed our other friends, I muſt bid you welcome Ladie amongſt the reſt, and in my welcome craue to be reſolued, how you reſolue touching my profered loue vnto you, here your mother and the Peeres agree, and all is ended, if you condeſcend.
            
            
               Eliz.
               Then know my Lord, that if my mother pleaſe, I muſt in dutie yeeld to her command, for when our aged father left his life, he willed vs honour ſtill our mothers age: and therefore as my dutie doth command, I do commit my ſelfe to her diſpoſe.

that faire Elizabeth may liue for aye, and neuer yeeld to death.

               And liues George Standley? Then happie that I am to ſee him freed thus from a tyrants rage. Welcome my ſonne, my ſweete George welcome home.

               Thanks my good father, and George Standley ioyes to ſee you ioynd in this aſſembly. And like a lambe kept by a greedie Woolfe within the incloſed ſentire of the earth, expecting death without deliuerie, euen from this daunger is George Standley come, to be a gueſt to Richmond & the reſt: for when the bloodie butcher heard your honour did refuſe to come to him, hee like a ſauage tygre then inraged, commanded ſtraight I ſhould be murdered, & ſent theſe two to execute the deed, but they, but they, that knew how innocēt I was, did poſt him off with many long delayes, alleaging reaſons to alaie his rage, but twas in vaine, for he like to a ſtarued Lioneſſe ſtill called for blood, ſaying that I ſhould die. But to be briefe, when both the battels ioyned, theſe two and others, ſhifted me away.

He died when he had raigned full three and twentie yeares eight moneths, and ſome odde dayes, and lies buried in Weſtminſter. He died & left behind a ſonne.
            
            
               Meſſ.
               A ſonne he left, a Harry of that name, a worthie, valiant, and victorious Prince, for on the fifth yeare of his happie raigne, hee entered France, and to the Frenchmens coſts, hee wonne Turwen, and Turney. The Emperor ſerued this King for common pay, and as a merſonary prince did follow him. Then after Morle and Morles, conquered he, and ſtill did keepe the French men at a bay. And laſtly in this Kings decreaſing age, he conquered Bullen, and after when he was turned home he died, when he had raigned full thirtie eight yeares, nine moneths and ſome odde dayes, and was buried in Windſore. He died and left three famous ſprings behinde him.

He brought the Engliſh ſeruice firſt in vſe, and died when he had raigned ſix yeares, fiue moneths, & ſome odde dayes, and lieth buried in Weſtminſter.

               Queene.
               Worthie Elizabeth, a mirrour in her age, by whoſe wiſe life and ciuill gouernment, her country was defended from the crueltie of famine, fire and ſwoord, warres, fearefull meſſengers.
               
                  This is that Queene as writers truly ſay,
                  That God had marked downe to liue for aye.
                  Then happie England mongſt thy neighbor Iles,
                  For peace and plentie ſtill attends on thee:
                  And all the fauourable Planets ſmiles
                  To ſee thee liue, in ſuch proſperitie.
                  She is that lampe that keeps faire Englands light,
                  And through her faith her country liues in peace:
                  And ſhe hath put proud Antichriſt to flight,
                  And bene the meanes that ciuill wars did ceaſe.
                  Then England kneele vpon thy hairy knee,
                  And thanke that God that ſtill prouides for thee.
                  The Turke admires to heare her gouernment,
                  And babies in 
                        
                           •
                        ury, ſound her princely name,
                  All Chriſtian Princes to that Prince hath ſent,
                  After her rule was rumord foorth by fame.
                  The Turke hath ſworne neuer to lift his hand,
                  To wrong the Princeſſe of this bleſſed land.
                  Twere vaine to tell the care this Queene hath had,
                  In helping thoſe that were oppreſt by warre:
                  And how her Maieſtie hath ſtil bene glad,
                  When ſhe hath heard of peace proclaim'd from far.
                  
                     Ieneua, France, and Flanders hath ſet downe,
                  The good ſhe hath done, ſince ſhe came to the Crowne.
                  For which, if ere her life be tane away,
                  God grant her ſoule may liue in heauen for aye.
                  For if her Graces dayes be brought to end,
                  Your hope is gone, on whom did peace depend.
               
            
            FINIS.
