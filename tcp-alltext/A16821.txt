or Companie of the Porters.
            To the tune of, In Edenbrugh, behold.
            
               
                  At the first went we, as here you see. But since our Corporation, on this fashion. And to our Hall, thus we goe all.
               
            
            
               THrise blessed is that Land
               where King and Rulers bee.
               and men of great Command
               that carefull are to sée,
               
                  
                     〈…〉

               is 
                     •
                  nto all extended
               rich, poore, both great and small,
               are by his care defended.
            
            
               As plainly doth appeare,
               by that was lately done,
               for them that burthens b
                     •
                  are,
               and doe on businesse runne:
               the Porters of this Cittie,
               so
                     •
                  e being men of Trade,
               but now the more, the more the pitty
               by crosses are decayde.
            
            
               Yet bearing honest mindes,
               their charge for to maintaine,
               as Gods command them 
                     •
                  indes,
               with trauell and with paine:
               they all haue wisely ioynd,
               for that they haue effected,
               their company to Linde
               and make it more respected.
            
            
               Now they that were before
               of meanest estimation,
               by suite haue sa
                     •
                  ude that sore,
               and gainde a Corporation:
               excludes, and shuts out many
               that were of base esteeme,
               and will not suffer any
               such person bide with them.
            
            
               But such as well are knowen,
               and honest Acts imbrace:
               among them theile haue none
               that haue no biding place:
               among them theile haue none
               (as neare as they can finde)
               but such as well are knowen
               to beare an honest minde.
            
            
               For now vnto their hall
               they pay their quarteridge 
                     •
                  owne,
               attending maisters call,
               and fearing maisters frowne,
               there seeking for redresse
               and right if they haue wrong,
               there, they that doe trangresse
               haue that to them doth long.
            
            
               
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
               
               
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
               
               then that they had before,
               when as the malefactor
               was on a coultstaffe bore:
               for th' owner tis much better,
               but for th' offender worse,
               to taste this newe made order,
               then ride a wooden horse.
            
            
               That shame was soone slipt ouer,
               soone in obliuion drownde,
               and then againe, another
               would in like fault be found:
               not caring for their credit,
               and trust another time,
               this orders therefore as a bit
               to hold them from that crime.
            
            
               They that are rash, and rude,
               and obstinately runne
               as their owne willes conclude,
               and cannot well be wonne
               to condescend, and stand
               to orders they haue made,
               by the Rulers out of hand,

               All iarres and braules are bard
               that mongst them might arise,
               first commer, first is serude,
               where as a burthen lyes,
               if one be ready there
               he must his profite take:
               all other must forbeare
               and no resistance make.
            
            
               Such as haue long bin knowen
               to vse this bearing trade,
               and into yeares are growen,
               (so that their strengths decayde)
               they can no longer labour
               as they haue done before,
               the Companie doth succo

               and maintaine euermore.
            
            
               These and a many moe
               good orders they haue, sure,
               to make rude fellowes know
               their stoutnesse, doth procure.
               but their owne detriment

               but things will be amiss
               as oft it hath bin knowen,
               the number of them is,
               a thousand fortie one.
            
            
               They all mette together.

                  st hansomely arayde,
               at Christ church, to heare there
               a sermon, for them made.
               There markes of Admittaince
               made out of tinne, they ba

                  e
               about their neckes in ribbons:
               the chiefe, of siluer weare.
            
            
               To haue seene them so, you'
                     •
                   wonder,
               so many should maintaine
               themselues, by such a labour,
               but that, thats got with paine,
               God doth increase and blesse:
               for good himselfe hath sed,
               with paine and wearinesse,
               we all should get our bread.
            
            
               Thus therefore I conclude,
               more happie men are they,
               then many that delude
               the world, and beare away
               the swéete of poore mens labour
               their chests to cram and stuffe,
               not caring for Gods fauour,
               so they haue golde enough.
            
            
               Our royall King and Quéene
               thou King of Kings defend,
               as thou to them hast béene
               most mercifull and kinde:
               thy loue to them increase,
               blesse all they vndertake:
               His Counsels counsell, blesse,
               euen for thy deare sons sake.
