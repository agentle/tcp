               But this our purpose now is twelue month old,
               And bootelesse tis to tell you we wil go.
               Therefore we meet not nowe: then let me heare
               Of you my gentle Cosen Westmerland,
               What yesternight our counsell did decree
               In forwarding this deere expedience.
            
            
               West.
               My liege, this haste was hot in question,
               And many limits of the charge set down
               But yesternight, when all athwart there came
               A post from Wales, loden with heauy newes,
               Whose worst was that the noble Mortimer,
               Leading the men of Herdforshire to fight
               Against the irregular, and wild Glendower,
               Was by the rude hands of that Welchman taken,
               A thousand of his people butchered,
               Vpon whose dead corpes there was such misuse,
               Such beastly shamelesse transformation
               By those Welch-women done, as may not be
               Without much shame, retould, or spoken of.
            
            
               King.
               It seemes then that the tidings of this broile,
               Brake off our businesse for the holy land.

               Here is deere, a true industrious friend,
               Sir Walter Blunt new lighted from his horse,
               
                  Staind with the variation of each soile,
               Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours:
               And he hath brought vs smothe and welcom newes,
               The Earle of Douglas is discomfited,
               Ten thousand bould Scots, two and twenty knights
               Balkt in their own bloud. Did sir Walter see
               On Holmedons plaines, of prisoners Hotspur tooke
               Mordake Earle of Fife, and eldest sonne
               To beaten Douglas, and the Earle of Athol,
               Of Murrey, Angus, and Menteith:
               And is not this an honorable spoile?
               A gallant priz? Ha coosen, is it not? In faith it is.
            
            
               West.
               A conquest for a Prince to boast of.
            
            
               King.
               Yea, there thou makst me sad, and makst me sinne
               In enuy, that my Lord Northumberland
               Should be the father to so blest a sonne:
               A sonne, who is the theame of honors tongue,
               Amongst a groue, the very straightest plant,
               Who is sweet fortunes minion and her pride,
               Whilst I by looking on the praise of him
               See ryot and dishonour staine the brow
               Of my young Harry. O that it could be prou'd
               That some night tripping fairy had exchang'd,
               In cradle clothes our children where they lay,
               And cald mine Percy, his Plantagenet,
               Then would I haue his Harry, and he mine:
               But let him from my thoughts. What think you coose
               Of this young Percies pride? The prisoners
               Which he in this aduenture hath surprizd
               To his own vse, he keepes and sends me word
               I shal haue none but Mordake Earle of Fife.
            
            
               West.
               This is his vncles teaching. This is Worcester,
               Maleuolent to you in all aspects,
               Which makes him prune himselfe, and bristle vp
               The crest of youth against your dignity.
            
            
               King.
               But I haue sent for him to answere this:
               And for this cause a while we must neglect
               Out holy purpose to Ierusalem.

               At Windsore, so informe the Lords:
               But come your selfe with speed to vs againe,
               For more is to be said and to be done,
               Then out of anger can be vttered.
            
            
               West.
               I will my liege.
Exeunt.
               
            
            Enter prince of Wales, and Sir Iohn Falstaffe.
            
               Falst.
               Now Hal, what time of day is it lad?
            
            
               Prince.
               Thou art so fat-witted with drinking of olde sacke, and vnbuttoning thee after supper, and sleeping vpon benches afternoone; that thou hast forgotten to demaunde that truelie which thou wouldest trulie knowe. What a diuell hast thou to do with the time of the daie? vnles houres were cups of sacke, and minutes capons, and clockes the tongues of Baudes, and Dialles the signes of leaping houses, and the blessed sunne himselfe a faire hot wench in flame-couloured taffata; I see no reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demaunde the time of the day.
            
            
               Falst.
               Indeede you come neere me nowe Hal, for wee that take purses go by the moone and the seuen stars, and not by Phoebus, he, that wandring knight so faire: and I prethe sweet wag when thou art a king as God saue thy grace: maiestie I should say, for grace thou wilt haue none.
            
            
               Prince.
               What none?
            
            
               Falst.
               No by my troth, not so much as will serue to bee prologue to an egge and butter.
            
            
               Prin.
               Wel, how then? come roundly, roundly.
            
            
               Falst.
               Marry then sweet wag, when thou art king let not vs that are squiers of the nights bodie, bee called theeues of the daies beauty: let vs be Dianaes forresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the moone, and let men say wee be men of good gouernement, being gouerned as the sea is, by our noble and chast mistresse the moone, vnder whose countenaunce we steale.
            
            
               Prince.
               Thou saiest well, and it holds wel to, for the fortune of vs that are the moones men, doth ebbe and flow like the sea, being gouerned as the sea is by the moone, as for proofe. Now

a purse of gold most resolutely snatcht on Munday night and most dissolutely spent on tuesday morning, got with swearing, lay by, and spent with crying, bring in, now in as low an ebbe as the foot of the ladder, and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallowes.
            
            
               Falst.
               By the Lord thou saist true lad, and is not my hostesse of the tauerne a most sweet wench?

               As the hony of Hibla my old lad of the castle, and is not a buffe Jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?
            
            
               Falst.
               How now, how nowe mad wag, what in thy quips and thy quiddities? what a plague haue I to doe with a buffe Ierkin?
            
            
               Prince.
               Why what a poxe haue I to do with my hostesse of the tauerne?
            
            
               Falst.
               Well, thou hast cald her to a reckoning many a time and oft.
            
            
               Prince.
               Did I euer call for thee to pay thy part?
            
            
               Falst.
               No, ile giue thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.
            
            
               Prin.
               Yea and else where, so far as my coine would stretch, and where it would not, I haue vsed my credit.
            
            
               Falst.
               Yea, and so vs'd it that were it not here apparant that thou art heire apparant. But I prethe sweet wag, shall there be gallowes standing in England when thou art king? and resolution thus subd as it is with the rusty curbe of olde father Anticke the law, do not thou when thou art king hang a theefe.
            
            
               Prince.
               No, thou shalt.
            
            
               Falst.
               Shall I? O rare! by the Lord ile be a braue iudge.
            
            
               Prin.
               Thou iudgest false already, I meane thou shalt haue the hanging of the theeues, and so become a rare hangman.
            
            
               Falst.
               Well Hall well, and in some sort it iumpes with my humour, as well as waighting in the Court I can tell you.

               My liege, I did denie no prisoners,
               But I remember when the fight was done,
               When I was drie with rage, and extreame toile,
               Breathles and faint, leaning vpon my sword,
               Came there a certaine Lord, neat and trimly drest,
               Fresh as a bridegroome, and his chin new rept,
               Shewd like a stubble land as haruest home,
               He was perfumed like a Milliner,
               And twixt his finger and his thumbe he helde
               A pouncet boxe, which euer and anon
               He gaue his nose, and tookt away againe,
               Who therewith angry, when it next came there
               Tooke it in snuffe, and still hee smild and talkt:
               And as the souldiours bore dead bodies by,
               He cald them vntaught knaues, vnmanerlie,
               To bring a slouenly vnhandsome coarse
               Betwixt the winde and his nobilitie:
               With many holly-day and ladie termes
               He questioned me, amongst the rest demanded
               My prisoners in your Maiesties behalfe.

               Answerd neglectingly, I know not what
               He should or he should not, for he made me mad
               To see him shine so briske, and smell so sweet,
               And talke so like a waiting gentlewoman,
               Of guns, and drums, and wounds, God saue the mark:
               And telling me the soueraignest thing on earth
               Was Parmacitie, for an inward bruise,
               And that it was great pitty, so it was,

               Which many a good tall fellow had destroyed
               So cowardly, and but for these vile guns

               Shall we buy treason? and indent with feares

               No, on the barren mountaines let him starue;

               Harrie, I doe not onelie maruaile where thou spendest thy time, but also how thou art accompanied. For though the cammomill, the more it is troden on, the faster it growes: so youth the more it is wasted, the sooner it weares: that thou art my son I haue partly thy mothers worde, partlie my owne opinion, but chieflie a villainous tricke of thine eye, and a foolish hanging of thy neather lippe, that dooth warrant me. If then thou bee sonne to mee, heere lies the poynt, why beeing sonne to me, art thou so pointed at? shal the blessed sunne of heauen proue a micher, and eat black-berries? a question not to be askt. Shall the sonne of England proue a theefe, and take purses? a question to be askt. There is a thing Harry, which thou hast often heard of, and it is knowne to many in our land by the name of pitch. This pitch (as ancient writers do report) doth defile, so doth the companie thou keepest: for Harrie, now I do not speake to thee in drinke, but in teares; not in pleasure but in passion: not in words onely, but in woes also: and yet there is a vertuous man, whom I haue often noted in thy companie, but I know not his name.

For Harry, I see vertue in his lookes: if then the tree may bee knowne by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then peremptorily I speake it, there is vertue in that Falstalffe, him keepe with the rest banish, and tell me now thou naughtie varlet, tell me where hast thou beene this month?

               For we shall presently haue neede of you.
Exeunt Lords.
               
               I know not whether God will haue it so
               For some displeasing seruice I haue done,
               That in his secret doome out of my blood,
               Heele breed reuengement and a scourge for me:
               But thou dost in thy passages of life,
               Make me beleeue that thou art onely markt
               For the hot vengeance, and the rod of heauen,
               To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else
               Could such inordinate and low desires,
               Such poore, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,
               Such barten pleasures, rude societie
               As thou art matcht withall, and grafted to,
               Accompanie the greatnesse of thy blood,
               And hold their leu

               So please your Maiestie, I would I could
               Quit all offences with as cleare excuse,
               As well as I am doubtlesse I can purge
               My selfe of many I am chargd withall,
               Yet such extenuation let me beg,
               As in reproofe of many tales deuisde,
               Which oft the eare of greatnes needs must heare
               By smiling pickthanks, and base newes mongers,
               I may for some things true, wherein my youth
               Hath faulty wandred, and irregular,
               Find pardon on my true submission.
            
            
               Kin.
               God pardon thee yet let me wonder, Harry,
               At thy affections, which do hold a wing
               Quite from the flight of all thy auncestors,
               Thy place in counsell thou hast rudely lost
               Which by thy yonger brother is supplide,
               And art almost an allien to the harts
               
                  Of all the Court and princes of my blood,
               The hope and expectation of thy time
               Is ruind, and the soule of euery man
               Prophetically do for
                     •
                  thinke thy fall:
               Had I so lauish of my presence beene,
               So common hackneid in the eyes of men,
               So stale and cheape to vulgar companie.
               Opinion that did helpe me to the crowne,
               Had still kept loyall to possession,
               And left me in reputelesse banishment,
               A fellow of no marke nor likelihoode.
               By being seldome seene, I could not stirre
               But like a Comet I was wondred at
               That men would tell their children this is he:
               Others would say, where, which is Bullingbrooke?
               And then I stole all curtesie from heauen,
               And drest my selfe in such humilitie
               That I did plucke allegiance from mens hearts,
               Loud shouts, and salutations from their mouths,
               Euen in the presence of the crowned king.
               Thus did I keepe my person fresh and new,
               My presence like a roabe pontificall,
               Nere seene but wondred at, and so my state
               Seldome, but sumptuous shewd like a feast,
               And wan by rarenesse such solemnitie.
               The skipping king, he ambled vp and downe,
               With shallow iesters, and rash bauin wits,
               Soone kindled, and 
                     •
                  oone burnt, ca
                     •
                  ded his state,
               Mingled his royaltie with cap

                     •
                  ooles,
               Had his great name prophaned with their scornes,
               And gaue his countenance against his name
               To laugh at gibing boyes, and stand the push
               Of euery beardlesse vaine comparatiue,
               Grew a companion to the common stree
                     •
                  es,
               Enfe oft himselfe to popularitie,
               That being dayly swallowed by mens eyes,
               They surfetted with honie, and began to loath
               The taste of sweetnesse, whereof a little
               
                  More then a little, is by much too much.
               So when he had occasion to be seene,
               He was but as the Cuckoe is in Iune,
               Heard, not regarded: Scene, but with such eies
               As sicke and blunted with communitie,
               Affoord no extraordinary gaze.
               Such as is bent on sun-like maiestie,
               When it shines seldome in admirring eies,
               But rather drowzd, and hung their eie-lids down,
               Slept in his face, and rendred such aspect
               As cloudy men vse to their aduersaries,
               Being with his presence glutted, gordge, and full.
               And in that very line Harry standest thou,
               For thou hast lost thy princely priuiledge
               With vile participation. Not an eye
               But is a weary of thy common sight,
               Saue mine, which hath desired to see thee more,
               Which now doth that I would not haue it do,
               Make blind it selfe with foolish tendernesse.
            
            
               Prin.
               I shall hereafter my thrice gratious Lord,
               Be more my selfe.
            
            
               King.
               For all the world,
               As thou art to this houre was Richard then,
               When I from France set foot at Rauenspurgh,
               And euen as I was than, is Percy now,
               Now by my scepter, and my soule to boote,
               He hath more worthie interest to the state
               Then thou the shadow of succession.
               For of no right, nor colour like to right,
               He doth fill fields with harnesse in the realme,
               Turnes head against the lions armed iawes,
               And being no more in debt to yeares, then thou
               Leads ancient Lords, and reuerend Bishops on
               To bloudie battailes, and to bruising armes.
               What neuer dying honour hath he got
               Against renowmed Dowglas? Whose high deeds,
               Whose hot incursions, and great name in armes,
               Holds from al souldiors chiefe maioritie
               And militarie title capitall.

               Discomfited great Dowglas, tane him once,
               Enlargd him, and made a friend of him,
               To fill the mouth of deepe defiance vp,
               And shake the peace and safety of our throne,
               And what say you to this? Percy Northumberland,
               The Archbishops grace of York, Dowglas, Mortimer,
               Capitulate against vs, and are vp.
               But wherefore do I tel these newes to thee?
               Why Harry do I tell thee of my foes,
               Which art my nearest and dearest enemy?
               Thou that art like enough through vassall feare,
               Base inclination, and the start of spleene,
               To fight against me vnder Percies pay,

               To shew how much thou art degenerate.

               Do not thinke so, you shal not find it so,
               And God forgiue them that so much haue swaide
               Your maiesties good thoughts away from me.
               I will redeeme all this on Percies head,
               And in the closing of some glorious day
               Be bold to tell you that I am your sonne,
               When I will weare a garment all of bloud,
               And staine my fauors in a bloudy maske,

                  e my shame with it,

               That this same child of honour and renowne,
               This gallant Hotspur, this all praised knight,
               And your vnthought of Harry chance to meet,
               For euery honor sitting on his helme
               Would they were multitudes, and on my head
               My shames redoubled. For the time will com
               That I shall make this Northren youth exchange
               His glorious deedes for my indignities.
               Percy is but my factor, good my Lord,
               To engrosse vp glorious deeds on my behalfe.

               Yea, euen the sleightest worship of his time,
               Or I will teare the reckoning from his heart.
               This in the name of God I promise heere,
               The which if he be pleasd I shall performe:
               I do beseech your maiesty may salue
               The long grown wounds of my intemperance,
               If not, the end of life cancels all bands,
               And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
               Ere breake the smallest parcell of this vow.

               Let it be seene to morrow in the battell which of vs feares:

               Content.

               Come, come, it may not be.
               I wonder much being men of such great leading as you are,
               That you foresee not what impediments
               Drag backe our expedition, certaine horse
               Of my coosen Vernons are not yet come vp,
               
                  Your Vncle Worcesters horses came but to day,
               And now their pride and mettall is a sleepe,
               Their courage with hard labour tame and dull,
               That not a horse is halfe the halfe of himselfe.
            
            
               Hot.
               So are the horses of the enemie
               In generall iourney bated and brought low,
               The better part of ours are full of rest.
            
            
               Wor.
               The number of the King exceedeth our,
               For Gods sake coosen stay till all come in.
            
            The trumpet sounds a parley. Enter sir Walter Blunt.
            
               Blunt.
               
                  I come with gracious offers from the king,
               If you vouchsafe me hearing, and respect.
            
            
               Hot.
               Welcome sir Walter Blunt: and would to God
               You were of our determination,
               Some of vs loue you well, and euen those some
               Enuy your great deseruings and good name,
               Because you are not of our qualitie,
               But stand against vs like an enemie.
            
            
               Blunt.
               And God defend but still I should stand so,
               So long as out of limit and true rule
               You stand against annointed Maiestie.
               But to my charge. The king hath sent to know
               The nature of your griefes and whereupon
               You coniure from the breast of ciuill peace
               Such bold hostilitie: teaching his dutious land
               Audacious crueltie. If that the king
               Haue any way your good deserts forgot
               Which he confesseth to be manifold,
               He bids you name your griefes, and with all speede,
               You shall haue your desires with interest
               And pardon absolute for your selfe, and these
               Herein misled by your suggestion.
            
            
               Hot.
               The king is kind, and well we know the king
               Knowes at what time to promise, when to pay:
               My father, and my vncle and my selfe,
               Did giue him that same royaltie he weares,
               And when he was not sixe and twentie strong,
               Sicke in the worlds regard: wretched and low

                  eaking home,
               My father gaue him welcome to the shore:
               And when he heard him sweare and vow to God,
               He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,
               To sue his liuery, and beg his peace
               With teares of innocencie, and tearmes of zeale,
               My father in kinde heart and pitie mou'd,
               Swore him assistance, and performd it too.
               Now when the Lords and Barons of the realme,
               Perceiu'd Northumberland did leane to him,
               The more and lesse came in with cap and knee,
               Met him in Borroughs, Cities, Villages,
               Attended him on bridges, stoode in lanes,
               Laid gifts before him, profferd him their oathes,
               Gaue him their heires, as Pages followed him,
               Euen at the heeles, in golden multitudes,
               He presently, as greatnesse knowes it selfe,
               Steps me a little higher then his vow
               Made to my father while his blood was poore
               Vpon the naked shore at Rauenspurgh,
               And now forsooth takes on him to reforme
               Some certaine edicts, and some streight decrees,
               That lie too heauie on the Common-wealth,
               Cries out vpon abuses, seemes to weepe
               Ouer his Countrey wrongs, and by this face
               This seeming brow of iustice did he winne
               The hearts of all that he did angle for:
               Proceeded further, cut me off the heads
               Of all the fauourits that the absent king
               In deputation left behind him here,
               When he was personall in the Irish warre.

               Then to the poynt.
               In short time after he deposd the king,
               Soone after that depriu'd him of his life,
               And in the necke of that taskt the whole state,
               To make that woorse, suffred his kinsman March
               (Who is if euerie owner were well plac'd
               
                  Indeed his king) to be ingagde in Wales,

               This head of safetie, and withall to prie

               Hie good sir Mighell, beare this sealed briefe
               With winged haste to the Lord Marshall,
               This to my coosen Scroope, and all the rest
               To whom they are directed. If you knew
               How much they do import you would make hafte.
            
            
               Sir M.
               My good Lord I gesse their tenor.
            
            
               Arch.
               Like enough you do.
               To morrow good sir Mighell is a day,
               Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
               Must bide the touch. For sir at Shrewsbury
               As I am truly giuen to vnderstand,
               The king with mighty and quicke raised power
               Meetes with Lord Harry And I feare sir Mighell
               What with the sicknesse of Northumberland,
               Whose power was in the first proportion,
               And what with Owen Glendowers absence thence,
               Who with them was a rated sinew too.
               
                  And comes not in ouerrulde by prophecies,
               I feare the power of Percy is too weake
               To wage an instant triall with the king.
            
            
               Sir M.

                  d Lord, you need not feare,
               There is Douglas, and Lord Mortimer.
            
            
               Arch.
               No, Mortimer is not there.
            
            
               Sir M.
               But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy.
               And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head
               Of gallant warriours, noble gentlemen.
            
            
               Arch
               And so there is: but yet the king hath drawn
               The speciall head of all the land togither,
               The Prince of Wales, Lord Iohn of Lancaster,
               The noble Westmerland, and warlike Blunt,
               And many mo coriuals and deare men
               Of est

               Doubt not my Lo: they shalbe wel oppos'd.
            
            
               Arch.
               I hope no lesse; yet needfull tis to feare,
               And to preuent the worst, sir Mighell speed:
               For if Lord Percy thriue not ere the king
               Dismisse his power, he meanes to visit vs,
               For he hath heard of our confederacy,
               And tis but wisedome to make strong against him,
               Therefore make haste, I must go write againe
               To other friends and so farewell sir Mighel.
Exeunt

               The Southren winde
               Doth play the trumpet to his purposes,
               And by his hollow whistling in the leaues
               Foretels a tempest and a blustring day.
            
            
               Kin.
               Then with the loosers let it simpathize,
               For nothing can seeme foule to those that winne.
            
            The trumpet sounds. Enter Worcester
            
               King.
               How now my Lord of Worcester, tis not wel,
               That you and I should meet vpon such tearmes

               And made vs doffe our easie roabes of peace,
               To crush our old limbs in vngentle steele,
               This is not well my Lord, this is not well.
               What say you to it? will you againe vnknit
               This churlish knot of all abhorred war?
               And moue in that obedient orbe againe,
               Where you did giue a faire and naturall light,
               And be no more an exhalde meteor,
               A prodigie of feare, and a portent
               Of broched mischiefe to the vnborne times.
            
            
               Worst.
               Heare me my liege:
               For mine own part I could be well content,
               To entertaine the lag end of my life
               With quiet houres. For I protest
               I haue not sought the day of this dislike.

               You haue not sought it, how comes it then?

               Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it.

               Wor.
               It pleasd your maiesty to turne your lookes
               Of fauor from my selfe, and all our house,
               And yet I must remember you my Lord,
               We were the first and dearest of your friends,
               For you my staffe of office did I breake
               In Richards time, and posted day and night
               To meet you on the way, and kisse your hand,
               When yet you were in place, and in account
               Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.
               It was my selfe, my brother and his sonne,
               That brought you home and boldly did outdare
               The dangers of the time. You swore to vs,
               And you did sware that oath at Dancaster,
               That you did nothing purpose gainst the state,
               Nor clame no further then your new falne right,
               The seat of Gaunt, Dukedom of Lancaster:
               To this we swore our aide: but in short space
               It rainde downe fortune showring on your head,
               And such a floud of greatnesse fell on you,
               
                  What with our helpe, what with the absent king,
               What with the iniuries of a wanton time,
               The seeming sufferances that you had borne,
               And the contrarious winds that held the king
               So long in his vnlucky Irish wars,
               That all in England did repute him dead:
               And from this swarme of faire aduantages,
               You tooke occasion to be quickly wooed
               To gripe the general sway into your hand,
               Forgot your oath to vs at Dancaster,
               And being fed by vs, you vsd vs so
               As that vngentle gull the Cuckoes bird
               Vseth the sparrow, did oppresse our neast,
               Grew by our feeding to so great a bulke,
               That euen our loue durst not come neare your sight,
               For feare of swallowing: but with nimble wing
               We were inforst for safety sake to flie
               Out of your sight, and raise this present head,
               Whereby we stand opposed by such meanes,
               As you your selfe haue forgde against your selfe
               By vnkind vsage, daungerous countenance,
               And violation of all faith and troth,
               Sworne to vs in your yonger enterprize.
            
            
               King.
               These things indeed you haue articulate,
               Proclaimd at market Crosses, read in Churches,
               To face the garment of rebellion
               With some fine colour that may please the eye
               Of fickle changlings and poore discontents,
               Which gape and rub the elbow at the newes

               Albeit, considerations infinite
               Do make against it: no good Worcester no,
               We loue our people well, euen those we loue
               That are misled vpon your coosens part,
               And will they take the offer of our grace,
               Both he, and they, and you, yea euery man
               Shall be my friend againe, and ile be his,
               So tell your coosen, and bring me word
               What he will do. But if he will not yeeld,
               Rebuke and dread correction waight on vs,
               And they shall do their office. So be gone:
               We will not now be troubled with replie,

Who hath it? he that died a Wednesday, doth he feele it? no, doth he heare it? no, tis insensible thē? yea, to the dead, but wil not liue with the liuing; no, why? detraction will not suffer it, therefore ile none of it, honor is a meere skutchion, and so ends my Catechisme.
