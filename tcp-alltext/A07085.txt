Agayne, yf we synne wyllyngely after we haue receyued the knoweledge of the trueth, there remayneth no more sacrifyce for syn Heb. x. nes, but a fearfull lokyng for iudgemēt & violēt fyre, which shall destroy y• aduersaries

                         well. touchynge y• fyrst sentence of Paule S. Ambrose vnderstādeth it not of Penaunce, but of Baptisme. The In Heb. cap. vi. renouaciō or renuynge, sayth he, by the fonntayne of holy Baptisme can

not be made the second tyme. To be renued, he sayde that is, to be made newe. For it is the offyce of holy bap tisme to make a man newe. And a ly tle after he saythe, as Christe dyed once on the crosse as concernynge y• flesh, so do we dye once in Baptisme, not in flessh but in synne. And as he can not dye agayne, so can not we be baptised agayne, excepte peraduenture with the teares of Penaunce. not wyth the regeneracion of y• foun tayne. What than wylte thou saye, is there no Penaunce? There is Pe Note. naunce verely, but not another bap tisme. There is vndoutedly Penāce & it hath much vertu and strength, yea euen for hym also, that is verye much drowned in synne.
                  Thus se you that they that sinne after Baptisme, can not be made a newe by Baptisme (for y• is no more reiterated) yet is not here Penaūce denied vnto them, but synne they ne

uer so greatly, yet yf they repente & turne to our LORDE God. they shall surely fynde mercy and be saued.
                  And as concernynge the seconde texte saynt Ambrose vpon the same In Heb: cap: x. place sayth, that Christ dyed once for our synnes, & shall no more for them be offered. For wt one oblacion hathe he made them perfecte for euermore, that are sanctifyed. Thou art made cleane, thou arte free from synnes, y• arte made the sonne of God. If thou returnest to thy fyrste vomite, another iudgement taryethe for the, excepte thou be renued by Penaunce. Therfore lette euerye one, whyle he hath tyme, flye vnto the medicine of Penaunce, vnlesse he be commytted vnto euerlastynge fyre. These wordes declare opēly, that so ofte as we repent and turne, so ofte shall we be forgyuē. Only we ought not to loke for another Sacrifyce. For Christe alredy hath suffered once for all. Do

ye not perceyue nowe, howe greatly both the olde Heretykes, & also these theyr newe Apes, be deceyued?

This cōfession is so necessary, that wythout it no man can be saued. No manacynge wordes, no imprysonmēt, no chenes, no fetters, no sweard, no faggot, no fyre ought to plucke vs from this Confession.

                      Iohn. Hereby shall ye knowe the spy ryte of God. For euery spyryte that confesseth that Iesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God. And euery spy ryte which cōfesseth not that Iesus Christe is come in the flesshe, is not of god. And this is that spirite of An techrist, of whome ye haue herd, how that he should come, & nowe alredy is he in the worlde. But in asmuche as thys confession is not that parte of Penaunce, wherof we do nowe entreate, I wyll omit it at this presēt.
                  Another kynde of Confession is, The Confession of synnes vn to God. whiche pertayneth more nearely to our matter, for to confesse our synne vnto God, whome we haue offēded. wythout thys Confessyon oure Penāce auayleth but lytle, as we maye perceyue by dyuers places of ye scripture. For though al thynges are opē

LORDE sayde he, that I may receyue my sight. Christ demaunded thys thynge of hym, by cause he would haue hym cōfesse hys infirmite & blyndnes. So is it conueniēt for vs, yf we wyl receyue our syght, to confesse our blyndenes.

I sayde, I wyll confesse my vnryghteousnes to the LORDE, and thou hast forgyuen the vngodlynes of my synne. This confession follow eth a true repētant & cōtryte herte. The Prophet Daniel confesseth his Daniel. ix, synne on thys manner, we haue synned, we haue done vnryghteousnes, we haue wrought wickedly, we haue gone awaye & declined from thy cō
                     maundementes & iudgementes. Also Eldras, I and the house of my father ii. Esd. i. haue synned, we were seduced wt vanite, & haue not kepte thy commaundementes. Lykewyse Dauid, ii. Reg. xii. whan the Prophet Nathan at yt com manndement of God, rebuked hym for his adultery & manslaughter, cō fessed his synne, & sayde, I haue synned vnto ye 
                     LORDE. Agayne, O God.

I haue synned to the alone, & euel be fore the haue I done. The Publican Luke. xviii also made his confession on this mā
                     ner, O God be thou mercyfull to me a synner. This kynde of Confession ought euery christen man dayly and hourly to make vnto God, so ofte as he is broughte vnto the knoweledge of his synne.
                  Another kynde of Cōfession is to The confession of synnes to our neygh bour. Iacob. v. knowledge & confesse oure synnes to them, whome we haue offended. Of this speaketh S. Iames, sayeng, cō fesse your synnes one to another. Al so Christ, yf thou shalt offer thy gyft Math. v. at the Altare, & there doste remēber, that thy brother haue any thyng agaynst the, leaue thy gyfte there before the Altare, & go thy waye, and be fyrste reconcyled to thy brother, & than come on thy waye, & offer thy gyfte. This Confession, wherby we are reconcyled one to another, & con ioyned in mutuall amite, is so necessary,

that wythout it, the other pro fyt & auayle lytle before God.
                  There is another cōfessiō, which is publique & open, & this is, whan The publ

Of this confession speaketh Christe: If thy brother trespasse agaynst Mat. xviii, the, go & tell hym his faulte betwene the & hym alone. If he hea reth the, thou haste wonne thy brother. But if he heareth the not, thā take yet one or two with the, yt in the mouth of two or thre wytnesses euery matter maye be establysshed. If he heareth not thā, tell it to the congregaciō. If he heareth not the congregacion, holde hym as an He then and Publican.
                  All these kyndes of cōfession are abundantly fortressed & approued by the holy scriptures.

& store vp our selues to bryng forth fruytes worthy of Penaūce, & to cut away by true & vnfayned Contricion our synnes, yt we maye be founde worthy agaynst Easter, that is, agaynste the tyme of oure passyng & goyng out of this world clerely to beholde & openlye to se in the kyngedome of heauen the shynynge The secōd cause. face of God & his Sayntes.

either layd asyde or els couered, to put vs in remembraūce yt we ought nowe to lament & mourne for our soules dead in sinne, & continually to watche, praye, fast, gyue almes, & do such other workes of Penasice as wherwith God beyng excited & stored vnto his antique & olde mer cies, may call vs agayne frō death to lyfe, from synne to godlynes, frō wickednes to innocencye.
