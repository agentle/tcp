            From Rome I came / I can it not denye

            My dignite passeth all thinges mortall / 
            In me / in me alone is all goodnes 
                  •
               et
            Therfore now vnto me let all men fall.
            Thus haue I declared to you partly
            What profytes ye massehunters get by me / 
            But know ye / that not for the body onely
            But for the soule also I serue in eche degre.
            The soules that lye burning in Purgatory
            Miserably puling for wante of soccure / 
            By me they are redemed spedely
            And brought out of their payne in half an houre.
            The masse of Requiem is of great strengthe
            When for a soule it is eyther songe or sayde / 
            It alwayes helpeth without fayle at lengthe
            Though the soule with synne / be neuer so decayde.
            A trentall of masses is very profitable
            For a soule departed at euery season / 
            For that vnto glory without any fable
            Wil bring the soule with all expedicion.
            But not for purgatory soules onely
            Am I profitable and stond in s
                  •
               ead / 
            
               
The soules also / whiche in hell fyre do lye
            Are ofte by me from their paynes redemed.
            Unto the very helles dothe my vertue pearce
            When for any soule I am songe or sayde / 
            Sathan that tyraunte / bothe cruell and fearce
            Is of me and my power greatly afrayde.
            My noble presence maketh the deuell to rore
            And all the flames of hell shortly to quenche / 
            My royall presence causeth euermore
            All the infernall paynes quickely to stenche.
            Yea / from the dongeon of hell to heauen so hye
            Do I cause the damned soules for to ascend / 
            To me / to me therfore let all men applye
            If to come to glory they do intend.
            By me the soules of sainctes in heauen also
            Are lauded / praysed and magnifyde / 
            As the masse of Gaudeamus omnes in domino
            
            Dothe righte well declare at euery tyde.
            God and oure Ladye with the good sainctes all
            Apostles / martyrs / confessors and virgines / 
            With all the holy Aungels seraphicall
            By me do reioyce / as moste louing twynes.
            Thus ye se in Purgatory / heauen and hell
            I raygne as a moste tryumphāt Empresse / 
            So that to them / that in those places do dwell
            My vertue dothe extend bothe more and les.
            What shall I speake of my beneficence
            Toward the soules of them that be mortall / 
            To saue their soules / I am of great excellence
            When soeuer on me they earnestly call.
            
               
My Chaplens / thorow me offer dayly
            For all such as with mony do them hyre / 
            An holy sacrifice propiciatory
            And so deliuer their soules out of the myre.
            The synnes of the whole worlde / thorow me
            Are clerely remitted and put awaye / 
            My mighty power is to make them all fre
            Which for remission of synnes, mony do paye.
            Whatsoeuer synne is committed
            Be it pryde / whordome / thefte or blasphemy / 
            By me it is vtterly dispatched
            And the synners made bothe pure and holy.
            For clensyng of the soule / noman dothe nede
            To seke after any other Phisicion / 
            Be that liste vnto me / for to make spede
            Shall haue of me a sufficient purgacion.
            As men dayly do greuously offend
            So muste they haue a dayly sacrifice / 
            To be rydde of your synnes / if ye entend
            To haste vnto me / ye muste nedes deuice.
            For in me / my marked marchauntes eche on
                  •
               
            
            Offer vp Christ the sonne of God dayly / 
            They crucifye hym agayne / though he be go
                  ••
               
            
            And offer a sacrifice Propiciatory.
            And the sacrifice that they do offer
            Is of so greate efficacie / mighte and poure
            As that whiche Christ offered to hys father
            Whan he hanged on the Crosse at the laste houre
                  •
               
            
            By Christes death / the synne originall
            Was onely put awaye / as many holde
            
               
But I dispatche all synnes vniuersall
            As witnesse my Chaplens / bothe stoute and bolde.
            Folish are they therfore / that take thought for sy
                  •
               
            
            As though it were a burden intollerable / 
            
               
                  •
               eyng for a litle money they maye wynne
            Forgyuenes of synnes / and become vnculpable.
            When the masse begyues / they maye be synnefull
            But before the masse be perfectly ended / 
            My smered Chaplens / all synne frō them shall pul
            And make them to be thorowly saued.
            For the blessed masse is not so sone sayde
            Of the massinge Chaplens at the altare / 
            But all the debtes for synnes are wholy payde
            And they brought agayne to Gods fauer.
            Thus in heauen / earthe / hell and Purgatory
            I rayg
                  •

            All thinges are blessed by me / and made wealthy
            Deliuered from sorowe and all discresse.
            Agayne / what a number of idle bellyde priestes
            Besydes monkes / heremites / Chanons and fryers
            Do I fede / to be makers of Christes
            Whiche otherwise shoulde fall into the bryers.
            I make them to be hadde in reputatcion
            I make them to sitte hyest at the table.
            I make them to be called Syrs / euery one
            I make them worshipfull and honorable.
            I make them in their apparell to be
            Galaunte and pleasaunte in euery mans syghte
            I make them greatest in euery degre
            I make them makers of God almighty.
            
               
I make them to walke in goodly longe gounes
            With typpet
                  •
               es of sarcenet about their neckes
            I make them to weare forked cappes on their shauē
crounes
            I make thē to do what they list without checkes.
            I make them of the labour of other mens hādes.
            To liue idely lyke men of great substaunce / 
            I enryche them with gaye houses and landes
            I make them to lyue all in pleasance.
            I make them in loue with other mens wyues
            I make their chyldren to syt by other mens fyres / 
            I make them to lede pleasaunte & wealthy lyues
            Euen according to their hartye despres.
            I make them searchers of all mens secretes
            Thorow holy auriculare confession / 
            I make them to playe many praty feates
            And yet fewe spye their abhominacion.
            By me alone they mayntayne their whoring
            Their horses / their hauckes / their hondes & their spānels / 
            By me alone haue they their pleasaūt liuing
            Bunning here and there / or where they list els.
            I make the order of priesthoode honorable
            I onely / am the s
                  •
               aye of all massemongers / 
            It is I that make the masse priestes able
            To matche with the best / and to be called masters.
            If I were not / thei should haue many euel happes
            If I were not / their gouns should sone be threde bare
            If I were not / their hayre should grow thorow their
carpes.
            If, were not / they should haue bothe carcke & care.
            
               
I wolde therfore that noman should maruel
            Though massingpriestes do stoutly holde with me / 
            For they are certen / and do know right well
            That the best floure of their garlande I must be.
            Therefore whan ye heare thē loude lye at Paules crosse
            As many in their sermōs haue done of late / 
            Blame them not / for they haue had a longlosse
            Therfore it is now hye tyme for them to prate.
            Masses / Purgatory and prayeng for the dead
            Are the chief pyllers of their popish kyngdome / 
            If these thre thinges were once abrogated
            Then come they streyghtwayes vnto confusion.
            I woldē therfore / that my chaplens shoulde prate harde
            For these thre thinges aboue all other / 
            Or els their kyngdome shall neuer go forewarde
            By swete sainct Mary / Christes owne mother.
            For holy auriculare confession
            I wolde haue them also prate harde / harde / harde
            For if they haue not that popish inuencion
            Their market will be altogether marde.
            By that they shall know all mens secrety
            By that / they shall syt as Goddes in mens consciēce
            By that they shall bring the people wonderfully
            Into all submission and obedience.
            By that they shall make Lordes to thē for to lout
                  •
               
            
            Ladys and gentlemen shall they bring vnder / 
            By that as Gods they shall raygne rounde aboute
            And know where stuffe is against the next yeare.
            Thus haue I tolde you parte of my vertues
            And what I am able to do in euery place / 
            
               
I suppose ye thincke them very straunge newes
            Yet shall ye fynde them trew by oure Lady of gracē.
            My massing chaplens and the massehunters
            Know these thinges too be trew that I haue spoken / 
            Their diligent cōming to the masse euers
            Is hereof a very manifest token.
            Oh / somtime here in England gloriously
            I raygned as a Goddesse supernal / 
            Tyll Gods worde / in the time of kyng Henry
            Began to be knowne in places ouer all.
            Thorow the scripture and other treatises
            With the sermons of diuers learned menne / 
            To be espied began my fantasies
            So that many to me did not greatly leane.
            Yet thorow the s
                  •
               outenes of some prelates
            Which euer loued me for my fathers sake / 
            I styl continued among my pyldepates
            And the moste parte of men did me wel take.
            Notwithstanding / my people religious
            As monkes / chanons / heremites / nonnes and fryers / 
            Began among the people to be odious
            And were called hypocrites and lyers.
            Their hypocrisye and fayned holynes
            Came to lighte euery daye more and more / 
            Their vnchaste chastitie also certes
            Made all good people them to abhorre.
            Their abhominable lyfe was so manifest
            Besydes all their wicked Idolatrie / 
            That all godly men together thought it best
            All their houses to suppresse vtterly.
            
               
Suppreste they were vnto my great discomforte
            And bothe the I and they at the doores thruste out / 
            Few had we then / that wolde vs supporte
            So were we compelled to range about.
            Yet in paryshes and churches cathedral
            In colleges also was I s

               yl mayntayned / 
            There I founde fauour / what soeuer dyd befal
            And among them was I greatly commended.
            Yet was my courage wonderfully slayne
            To se me out of the monasteries exiled / 
            For I thoughte alwayes / I shoulde haue bene fayne
            Out of this realme shortly to haue fled.
            For many began my iugling to perceaue
            And what an enemy I was to Christes bloude / 
            They sayde I should no lenger them deceaue
            Therfore to banishe me / they thought it good.
            And without doubte so had it come to passe
            If the stoute prelates had not styked hard to me / 
            But they humbly kneled before the kynges grace
            And sayde / it wer

               etie, it shoulde so be.
            Many reasons out of duns and dorbel
            They brought forthe in the parliament hous / 
            But out of Gods worde neuer a deal
            No / not so muche as was worthe appylde lous.
            Yet their reasons went for payment amōnge them
            And I founde by acte of parliament / 
            To be necessary ad salutem
            
            For the quicke and dead / a godly entent.
            At the making of the .vi. articles done was this
            A right good parliamēt for my shauelinges / 
            
               
If that might remayne / we should neuer do amys
            But euermore rule lyke Lordes in all thinges.
            Now was it made bothe burning and hanging
            To speake agaynst me or that litle great God / 
            No better coulde I haue had it by wishing
            Than for these new fellowes to haue such a rodde.
            Now thought I my self in a goodly case
            And so sure / that I should neuer decaye / 
            Euery mancalled me the moste blessed masse
            And wayted on me lyke a Goddesse alwaye.
            Iraygned / I rule / I was in my ruffe.
            I was songe / I was sayde in euery coste /

            And magnifyed me to the vttermoste.
            Well was I tyll certayne of the new learninge
            Began to sturte vp after their olde fashion / 
            Agaynst me and the litle great God speaking
            Calling vs bothe horrible abhominacion.
            Then began my buttocks for feare to quake
            I thoughte my destruction to be at hande / 
            But the prelates did the matter vp take
            And those heretykes stoutely withstande.
            For shortly they burnt them / as their wonte is
            So vehement and whote is their charitie / 
            Thinking by this means to do hye seruice
            Unto Gods moste excellent maiestie.
            Somewhat chered agayn after that I was
            And rayned lyke a Goddesse moste nobly / 
            Yea / I was in a wonderfull good case
            Tyll the death of that mighty kynge Henry.
            
               
After hys death I began to waxe faynte
            For I that before was taken for a goddesse / 
            Coulde not now be admitted for a saincte
            An Idoll to call me / they did not ceasse.
            A sacrifice propiciatory
            Was I afore / bothe for the quicke and dead / 
            Yea / and that no salutem necessary
            By acte of parliament adiudged.
            Now am I proued no sacrifice at all
            But a playne enemy to Christus passion /

               t and Idol they do me call
            Worthy to be brought vnto vtter confusion.
            In the beginning of kynge Edwardes raygne
            They called me first to examination / 
            My self I did so slenderly mayntayne
            That all men might se my weake foundacion.
            For of Gods worde I haue no grounde at all
            That playnly dothe condemne me the trueth to tell / 
            At Rome had I my first originall
            Of a number of Popes / as it befell.
            Clouted and patched lyke a beggers cloke
            Was I / God knoweth / foule euell fauoredly / 
            Ragges they brought out of their popish poke
            And cobled them on me after their fansy.
            What myne owne name meane / I can not declare
            No / the papistes them selfs can it not define / 
            Although herein they haue taken full great care
            And wolde very gladly the trueth out fyne.
            This worde missa hath bene diligently soughte
            And yet can they not fynde / wherof it come / 
            
               
They studie about a matter of noughte
            This am I certen / that I came from Rome.
            Fyrst whan I was at the barre arraygned
            A certayne simple mayde / called the communion / 
            Before all the company / me greuously accused
            And layde to my charge muche abhominacion.
            She called me a thefe and a God robber
            An harlot and a spirituall whore / 
            Sayeng that I and my massers together
            Had vtterly dryuen Christ out at the doore.

            For the synnes / bothe of the quicke and the dead / 
            Whiche onely pertayneth to Christes office
            As by the scriptures it is clerely proued.
            Ye corrupte the wordes of the Lordes supper
            And adde of your owne imaginacion / 
            Ye reherse them also in hocker mocker
            That the people haue no edificacion.
            Ye set vp a straunge God to be worshipped
            Made of bread / lyke vnto a waffer cake / 
            Of wicked pope Urban / this haue ye learned
            And thus the true liuing God do ye forsake.
            The Sacrament of Christes body and bloud
            By you Antichristes is defyled vtterly / 
            Marchandyse ye make of it / as ye were woode
            And dayly to your chapmen ye sell it for monye / 
            The congregacion / by Christes appoyntement
            In perfecte loue should receaue it together / 
            But to eate it alone is your entent
            Standing lyke fylthye swyne at the aulter.
            
               
To the good playne people ye turne your backes
            And playe many a pratye iugling caste / 
            Brandon the iuglare had neuer goodlyer knackes
            Than ye haue at your masse / bothe fyrste and laste.
            At your masse ye mock ye mow / ye breath / ye blow
            At your masse ye kysse / ye lycke / ye knele / ye knocke / 
            At your masse about the chalice your God ye throw
            And dandle hym vp & doune lyken Robyn Rodocke.
            At your masse / lyke charmers and coniurers
            Ye make your crosses for feare of sprites / 
            At your masse ye blesse oft with your greasy fyngers
            I thincke it be for auoyding euel syghtes.
            At your masse ye stand nodding in your memēto
            Lyke Bedlem iackes / cleane out of your wyttes / 
            At your masse lyke shackled geese ye hoppe to & fro
            Now standing / now kneling / as it come by fyttes.
            At your masse lyke chuffes ye eate & drincke alone
            Cleane contrary to Christes institucion / 
            The people looke vpon you / but they kan get none
            Whiche doubtles / is a great abhominacion.
            At your masse / ye suppe and suppe / & styl ye suppe
            Tyll that ye leaue nothing at all behynde / 
            Than blesse ye the people with an emptye cuppe
            And sende them home / bothe ignorant and blynde.
            At your masse / God is openly blasphemed
            At your masse / Christes bloud is dishonored / 
            At your masse / all Idolatrie is committed
            At your masse / the Lordes supper is defyled.
            At your masse / the simple people are blynded
            At your masse / many blasphemies are done / 
            
               
At your masse / all good men with sorowe are fylled
            At your masse / the deuels in hell haue delectation.
            All good men vtterly abhorre the masse
            All good men will not be present at it / 
            All good men crye out vpon her and alas
            All good men wishe her hence for to flit.
            Where the masse is / there is no true religion
            For it is the head spring of all Idolatrie / 
            Where the masse is / there is all supersticion
            Wickednes and abhominable hypocrisy.
            None is to be founde so common an whore
            So notable an harlot / so stoute a strompet / 
            As the masse is / though she go from doore to doore
            With thousādes in one day to medle / she wil not let.
            Who therfore wayeng these abhominacions
            Will not consent to bānish the masse / 
            Seyng she is so full of supersticions
            And set Gods people in so damnable a case.
            If ye loue God / his worde and Sacrament
            Bannishe this whore away from among you / 
            Let her no lenger be here permanent
            Leste worser plagues do here after ensew.
            Bannishe her / and awaye with her aulters
            Doune with the pyxs that hange sohye / 
            Your copes and vestimentes with all suche matters
            Awaye with them as thinges of vilanye.
            After she had on this wyse tolde her tale
            To bannishe me all with one voyce did consent / 
            I spake / but nothing coulde I preuayle
            To conclude / vnto Rome streighwayes I went.
            
               
Pope Paule welcomed me very hartely
            So did the Bishoppes and Cardinalles eche one /

            Full suerely they culled and kyssed me
            And badde me be on a good conforte / 
            Though the whole worlde / doughter do forsake the

            Their wordes / I tell you / warned me at the harte
            As though it had bene gynger of the best / 
            I was glad / those fathers did not from me starte
            For with them yet I thoughte / I shoulde haue rest.
            After this came monckes / chanons and fryers
            Nonnes / heremites / anckers and anckresses / 
            All these welcomed me with goodly attyers
            And made of me euen as if a goddesse.
            Moreouer / bolde baudes and lusty lawers

            With all the rable of noughtye packes to and fro
            All these swarmed aboute me after their olde gyse.
            They welcomed and welcomed me agayne
            Ioyfull they were to beholde my visage / 
            Many of them sayde / I had taken great payn

            Seyng I had come so long a viage.
            In Rome I tarryed a certayne space
            To se what fauour the people bare to me / 
            
               
With the godly wyse I had but litle grace
            They iudged me a very Idol to be.
            I heare also / that in Fraunce and Italy
            Suche as to the studies Theological / 
            Do their myndes vnfaynedly applye
            Set by me and my chaplens nothing at all.
            In Polelande also / Portingale and Spayne.
            In Flaunders / Scotland and in many realmes mo / 
            I am lyke shortly to haue but litle gayne
            For many of them begynne from me to go.
            What shal I speake of Denmarke & Germany
            With many noble contryes and cities besyde / 
            They all haue forsaken me vtterly
            And are gone from me / bothe farre and wyde.
            They that the Gospel truly vnderstand
            And by the lighte therof espye my iugling / 
            Will no lenger vnto me be bonde
            But fle from me / as from a pestilent thing.
            So that besydes myne olde customers
            Whiche to you heretofore I rehersed / 
            I haue neither frendes nor yet louers
            That fauoure me with hartes vnfayned.
            And yet as I heare / some of my olde acquayfaūce
            Begynne to fall from me dayly more and more / 
            Which is to me certes a great greuaunce
            And will hereafter proue to a foule sore.
            The ende I afore see euidently
            I shal surely be bannished at / the laste / 
            For many do now myiugling espye
            So that oute at the doores I must be caste.
            
               
Euery plante that my heauenly father
            Hath not planted / sayeth Christ in the Gospel / 
            Shal be plucked vp by the rootes for euer
            Though the worlde be neuer so woode and fel.
            Of God am not I planted without doubte
            A doughter I am of the Popes begetting / 
            Therefore muste I also be rooted out
            Whan the tyme dothe come of Gods appoyntinge.
            Euen as other fantasies of men are gone
            So must I folow / will I / nyll I / 
            We shal all trudge by one and by one
            That God alone maye haue all the glory.
            We maye thorow the helpe of hypocrites
            Florish dayly / and prosper for a whyle / 
            But yet shortly shall we not be worthe .iij. mytes
            Be iudged of the people in euery yle.
            Remembringe these thinges / it maketh me agaste
            And so dothe it all my smered shorelinges / 
            No maruayle / for then is all our glory paste
            And we maye walke lyke a sorte of staruelinges.

            And the holy masse / bothe worshippe and honoure.
            Thus of my comming / all degrees were gladde
            I meane all those that loue the pope of Rome / 
            Onely the Gospellers semed to be sadde
            And lyke people that were vtterly vndone.
            Streyghtways was I had to this & that aultare
            Where I was honorably entreated / 
            All papistes came to me bothe nere and farre
            But the trew Christians me vtterly abhorred.
            They can not abyde the sighte of me
            But call me fylthie Idol and Maumette / 
            From me / as from the pestilence they fle
            And as many as they can also let.
            But as for my olde former acquayntaunc

            If they maye do oughte / I haue good affiaunce
            That I shal neuer fal vnto the grounde.
            Thus I that in sighte lately was dead
            Am rysen agayn moste triumphantly /

               w exiled
            And I in place set as a goddesse moste hye.
            My priestes that before with hayre were ouergrowen.
            Are now both smoth & smircking shorelinges / 
            Their gotishe beardes be now awaye throwen
            And their Caīlike crounes trīmed with shaueuīges

            Mony in their purses they haue plentye
            To maske / to masse they are so desyred / 
            The Catholickes for masses styll do crye
            By this means / my priestes are greatly enryched.
            As for the godly ministers certen
            They are trounsed in euery place / 
            Specially / if they be married men
            Suche fynde but litle mercy and grace.
            Fylthie whoring dothe the papistes wel please
            Holy matrimony they can not abyde / 
            To be marryed / they thincke it a disease
            Not semely for priestes at any tyde
            I doubt not / but my praters at Paules crosse
            And other champions takinge their parte / 
            Will so from poste to pillare them tosse
            That they shal haue litle ease at their harte.
            I truste we shal so handle the matter
            That priestes from their wyues shal be separate
                  •
               
            
            We also wil them so spoyle and begger
            That we shal bringe them to a poore state.
            Honest matrimony I can not abide
            Massinge / and that can not agre together / 
            Married priestes shal put their wijues asyde
            Or els be handled after an homely manner.
            All preachers and fauourers of the Gospel
            We wil surely bring as lowe as we maie / 
            
               
But all suche maskers as masses do sell
            We wil promote and make them gaye.
            I and my champions shall beare all the route
            The protestantes maye go pycke a sallet / 
            We papistes shal rule the roste rounde aboute
            And no man so hardye agaynst vs for to set.
            Thus shal I rule as a moste noble goddesse
            We shall all people bothe worshippe and honoure / 
            To extolle me my papistes shall not cease
            Speaking good of me at euery houre.
            But of one thing I must here geue warning
            To all my louers / bothe faithful and dere / 
            That they be diligent in this one thinge

            The cause why / I geue you suche a charge is this
            It was tolde me of a frende sence my comming / 
            That the masse should be dryuē out of Englād twise

            Therfore muste I nedes come vnto confusion
            Because my foundacion is so slender.
            I knowe also / there are a greate number

            Although outwardely they beare a fayre face / 
            They do but looke / when I shalbe confounded
            Then wil they crye / doune with her apace.
            Furthermore / it standeth you also in hande
            To looke vpon this matter diligently / 
            For I do you all to vnderstande
            The cause is yours also and not myne onely.
            The papistes / quod my frēde / shal twise haue a fal

            The fyrste right wel recouer they shal

            They shal then of the people be so hated
            That none shal vouchsafe to haue thē at their bourde
            Yea / of them selfs they shal so be ashamed
            That thei shal couer their crouns with a cowtourd.
            And then saide he / is their vtter destruccion come
            For after that time shal theey neuer more ryse / 
            But Christes gospel / euen vnto the dome
            Shal in this realme florishe in moste goodly wyse.
            Of oure fyrste fall / we haue had experience
            Of that we may wel iudge what shal folow.
            Let vs therefore takehede with all aduertence
