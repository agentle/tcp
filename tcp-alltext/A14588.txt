               Becauſe there are none earthly creatures, that can ſo aptly repreſente vntoo our outwarde ſenſes, thoſe thynges that God would haue vs to learne by this Sacrament.

               By the breakyng of the Bread, wee haue to learne the breakyng of the bodie of Chriſte vppon the Croſſe: and by the powryng forthe of the Wine, the ſheadyng of his bloud, and by the diſtributyng too all that are preſente▪ Chriſtes communicatyng hymſelfe vntoo all thoſe tha

And as the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine by digeſtion, paſſeth into the ſubſtaunce of our bodies, euen ſo by faithe, Chriſte and wee are vnited with an vnſpeakable vnion, and we made fleſhe of his fleſhe, and bones of his bones.

            Certaine Articles, very neneceſſary to be knowen of all younge Schollers of Chriſtes schole.
            Dooen by D.W. Arch.
            
               FIrſte, that the ende of our creation is to glorifie God.
            That the prayſe of Gods glorie beginneth at the knowledg of our ſelues.
            That the knowledge of our ſelues iſſueth out of the ſounde vnderſtandyng of the lawe, contained in the ten commaundements.
            That the lawe is the perfect rule of iuſtice, teachyng vs what wee ſhould doe, and forbidden the contrarie.
            The lawe was deuided into twoo tables, whereof the firſte contayneth foure commaundements, touchyng our duetie towards God, the ſeconde 
                  •
               ontayneth our duety towards our neighbour.
            
               The ende of the lawe is, to let vs ſee 
                  ••
               r ſinnes: that by the ſight therof we might bee conſtrained to flie vnto Chriſte.
            Sinne is the traſgreſſion of the lawe.
            Sinne entered into the worlde by Adams tranſgreſſion, and together with ſinne came death, and the curſe of God vpon all mankinde.
            The reward of euery ſinne, in Gods iuſtice, is eternall death and damnation.
            There is no meanes whereby we can either eſcape this eternall death, or deſerue any remiſſion of ſinnes, but onely Chriſte crucified by whom, we are free from the curſe of the lawe, and by whoſe bloud we haue redemtion, that is, the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes.
            None ſhall be ſaued, but thoſe that take holde vpon Chriſte and his merites, by a true and liuely faithe.
            This true and liuely faithe is a full

aſſenting of our hartes vnto the promyſes of GOD in Chriſte, ioy

            The ſumme of a Chriſtian mans faithe is contained in the twelue articles of our beleefe, commonly called the Apoſtles Creede.
            The preaching of the worde is the ordinary meane, whereby faithe is bothe bred and nouriſhed in vs.
            The inward workyng of the holly Ghoſte, maketh the worde preached ſauory and comfortable vnto vs.
            That good workes although they neither iuſtifie vs before God, nor deſerue any remiſſion of ſinne, yet haue their proper place, and ſtandyng and ſerue for diuers vſes.
            Firſt to glorifie God.
            Secondly, to publiſhe our faith vnto the worlde.

               Praier is a very earneſt liftyng vp of the harte vnto God in all kinde of neceſſities, whether inwardly of ſoule or outwardly of bodie.
            The Lordes Prayer is a perfecte patterne of all prayers, and contayneth within his reache, whatſoeuer can bee demaunded of God, needefull for our bodies or ſoules.
            The Lordes prayer contayneth ſixe peticions: three concernyng the glorie of God: and three touching our profite and welfare.
            There are foure principall thinges to be obſerued in prayer.
            Firſt, that we make our praiers to God onely and not to Saints.
            Secondly, that wee feele within our ſelues the marueilous greate want of the thinge prayed for, hauing our mindes wholy bent therevppon, & not caried awaie with bithoughts.

            The Sacramentes are meanes, whereby the weakeneſſe of our faith is vnderpropped.
            A Sacramente is an outwarde ſigne of inwarde grace, inſtituted of God.
            There be two Sacraments, baptiſme, and the ſupper of the Lorde.
            Baptiſme is an outwarde ſigne of the waſhyng awaye of ſinne, whiche we haue by Chriſtes bloud.
            In Baptiſme, we haue our names entred into the Family and Hoſholde of God.
            The Lordes ſupper repreſenteth our continuall feedyng in the ſame Familie and Houſholde of God.
            The Lordes Supper conſiſteth of outward ſignes and inward thinges

ſignified
            The outwarde ſignes are Bread and Wine.
            The inward thinges ſignified are Chriſtes bodie broken, and his bloud ſhed together, with all the benefits of his paſſion.
            Repentance is a bitter ſorrowing and ſobbing for ſinne, coupled always with a ſet purpoſe of amenment.
            It conſiſteth eſpecially in two thinges: the killyng of the olde man, with all his corrupt luſts and affections, and the quicknyng of the newe man, which after the image of God is created in righteouſneſſe & true holineſſe.
            The olde man is then killed, and the newe man quickned, when we die vnto ſinne, and liue vnto righteouſneſſe: that is to ſaie, when we are fallen intoo deadly hatred and malice, with our owne ſinfull affections and 
                  •
               aine conuerſation before paſte, ſtrivyng nowe at length to ſubdue our vnruly luſts, and to bring into captiuitie,

euery thought to the obedience of Chriſt, that ſo his ſpirite maie both rule and raigne in vs, and bring forth her goodly bloſſomes, faith, loue, mercie, patience, humilytie, chaſtitie, deſire of Gods worde, hartie good will to his true miniſters, diligēce in praier together with all increaſe of righteouſneſſe.
