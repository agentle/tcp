                        MOst worthy & right Worshipfull Gentlemen (of the Innes of Court,) vnto you, as vnto one of the fairest Ornaments of this happy Realme. I commende the benefit of this small Treatise: And I am wel perswaded, in this Dedication, that I salute the best paret of all the yong Gentlemen of Englande: For what Course so-euer, they afterwardes followe, there are very fewe Gentlemen, but, either are, or haue ben of your Societie: It is very wel knowen that these famous Houses are the first intertayners of your Lybertie.
                  For (notwithstanding) in your Gouernments, there are many good and peaceable Orders, yet your chiefest Discipline, is by the Purse. Those that are disposed, studdie the Lawes: who so liketh, without checke may follow Dalliance: And (certainly) the wanton

                     , which you (continuallie) behold, are not vnlike the Sirenes Inchauntmēts (were Poets faynings true;) you cōtinually walke by the Adamant Rockes, which drawe Siluer and Gold, as fast as Iron and Steele: you must be armed with more experience then the capacytie of yong yeares: or els, assirte your selues that Repentance will vnlose your Fetters: there is an olde Prouerb: Euil Company, corrupteth good maners: And (truely) I cannot see, how yong men, of the best education: should escape vnpoysoned, when vice is so conuersant with elder yeares.
                  O how happie were it for your Posteritie, if the Innes of the Court, were farre from Dicyng-houses, or Dieyng houses, with their Originall, the Deuill. But, if you cannot be thus seperated, this little Booke, will (with regarde) guide you as safe, as the Clue of thréede did Theseus, in the Laberinth. These Houses (outwardly) are of the substance of other Buildinges, but within are the Botches and By

                  You can haue, no fairer warnings then the steppes of your Companions falles, nor I, a more fortunate Rewarde for my trauaile, then to see you (worthie Gentlemen) to floorish.
                  I beseeche you, to be aduised: It is a more precious matter, to shun & Mischiefe, by other mennes harmes, then to learne the goodnes of a thing, by the losse therof. This sharp Discouerie, will make your fleering Deceiuers, my open Enemies: but I shalbe well strengthned, if my true Affection, broode in you a disdaine of their fellowshyp, & let them spurne their woorste, they hurt them selues, that are angrie with good Admonition. I dedicate this Booke to the Magestrates to whome, appertaineth the chastisment of euyll liuers, your woorst enemies: I dedicate to you (courteous Gentlemen) the Fruits of Noble Alexanders Counselles, as beseeming your worthinesse: I am but his Trouch-man, and your trustie frend. And (truely) your wisdomes may make his graue Counselles more profitable then their seuere Discipline: for the Medicine is of more value, that preserueth Health, then that which cureth Sicknesse. The health of a Gentlemā, is Honour & actions of vertue: in which, Alexander (liberally) instructeth you: The Maladie, nay, death of a Gentlemā, is an vndoyng to the posterytie, which is hastetied, by the sucking of Shifters: Of whome, I (constantly) hope, the good Maiestrates will ease you: I leaue further Ceremonies, in my Preface, leaste I seeme to iudge your Wisdomes, who are (for Learninge) a faire Beautie of the Common-wealth: my plaine Methode, in writing, showeth you a large hole to see Daye, which is ynouffe (with an Aduauntage) who retayne the vertue, to drayne Honie from a Weede: I ende to trouble you, at this time: but in no time, will leaue to bée:

                        AFTER THAT THE GOOD Emperour Alexander (surnamed) Seuerus, for his sharp correcting of vice, had restored the authoritie of the Senate, and had giuen breathe vnto their good Lawes: of whom the one sate without reuerence, and the other were read and not regarded, through the inordinate lyberties, and Priueleadges giuen vnto vice, by that vncleane Monster Heliogabalus, his Predecessor: Of the suddaine, Rome was brightned with the vertues of Iustice, as the world with the beames of the Sunne, after a horrible and darke tempest. But as there is no assurance of faire weather vntill the skie be cleare from clowdes, so (which well forsaw this good Emperour) there can be no common wealthe grounded peace and prosperitie, where there are not Informers to fynde out offenders, as well as Iudges to chasten offences: In so much, in the prime of his Gouernment, accompained with many graue Senators, as this good Emperour went vnto the Senat, in his passage hee might see the Cittyzins busielye

exercised in their seuerall trades: he incountred the Gentlemen in ciuil attire, and of euerie estate, found both himselfe and his Senators, saluted with much honour, reuerence and dutie.
                  And being in the Senate house, mounted in the iudiciall Throne, he sate long, and was litle occupyed with crimynall causes.
                  The Senators, no little gloried, that (appealing vnto the iudgement of Alexander) they might lawfully boast, that Rome, which was late a Forrest of wilde beastes, or to speake more properlie, a den of theeues, a San
                        •…
                     uarie for Ruffens, a priueledge for Strumpets: a place in whiche no vice was forbidden, nor vertu cōmaunded, by their great wisdomes was brought into so good an order, as Alexanders eyes could beholde no open offenders, nor his eares heare of any secreat offences. In so much, as after his returne to the Pallace, they lauded the Emperour, with many acclamations of vertue, attributing this happy reformation vnto his pietie, temperaunce, and Iustice: thinking, that in giuing of hym this soueraigntie, he would returne the praises vpon their paineful-trauels, with the incouragement, that the magnanimious Caesar gaue vnto his souldiours, saying: that their bloods wrot honor in his forehead, and therfore how precious he esteemed his owne honor, so carefull he was of their welfare. But Alexander, although he were second to none, in the regarding and the rewarding of vertuous Maiestrates, yet least by thinking, that this outwarde reformation, had in the common wealth setled an inwarde amendement, and thereby they shoulde growe negligent

in the administratiōs of their waighty charges, he with a light regarde, attended his owne deserued praises, to reaue them of the hope of particular commendations: yea, that they might wel know that all that glistered was not Golde, that alwaies the inwarde harte, was not discouered by the outward habit: he compared the best gouerned Common welth vnto a faire Aple, which being serched, hath a Core, and that the worthy Senators, might perceaue their errours, and to amende what was omitted of their owne duties, and necessarie to establish a happye gouernment, in this graue and prudent Oration hee set downe the daungerous estate of the publique weale: and with-al, a perfect remedie for the festred and inwarde maladies.
                  
                     The first Oration of Alexander, the Emperour, to the Senators.
                     Most graue and reuerende Fathers, we not a litle reioyce, through the grace of the immortal Gods, and your great wisdomes, to beholde the famous Rome, but yesterday (in comparison) infamed with al abhominatiōs, by the priueleges of our beastly predecessor, who meriteth neither the name of Emperour, nor man, no we in possession of her auncient vertues: And as we confesse, that by the deuine and heroyicall blessinges, the hoaresed voyce of Iustice is cleared: So wee like-wise hope, by the same graces, the remembraunce of vice and iniquitie shal-be rooted out.

But good Senators, to discontinue a prosperous beginning, with a slouthfull imagination, that the Common weale is sounde, because no in

                           •…
                        l with easie working of the Surgion, ourwardly seeme to heale, but it there bee not Corsiues applied, to eate out the roote thereof, this ouer hastie healing will breake foorth vnto a more greeuous maladie. Good Senators, vnto you al, it is wel knowen, that the publique weale hath of long time bin infected, with the most horrible vices, that euer humanitie practised: yea, so foule and vn cleane, as ciuill creatures are forbod to recite them, by the sauadge inclination of that Monster HELIOGABALVS, yea so lothsome and fylthy were his abhominations, as the worser sort of people, (his fauoured seruantes) so detested his detestable and vile lyfe, as they hasted his ouer-long proroged death. Now that the immortall Gods haue inuested vs with the Imperiall Maiestie, small is the wonder, though there appeare a reformation in the good, when the verie Reprobate were glutted with wickednesse. But reuerend Fathers, this sweete alteration is no warrant to the Magistrate, to be slouthfull in his function, least in not suruayinge of the best, the best them-selues be corrupted, as Moaths consume the finest garmentes, where they be seeldome worne, and lesse ouer-lookte: And although in the better sort, this inconuenience is to be feared, in the worser, this mischiefe is to be certenly expected: they wil vpon cuerie temptation returne to their naughtines as a Dog

to his vomit, and therfore these daungerous insyrmities in a Common wealth, must be cured as the skilfull Surgion doth a festred sore. Their causes must bee searched and their nourishing humors purged, and then amendment followeth. The cause of this inordinate lust, this excessiue drunkennesse, this outragious prodigalitye, & to be short, this hel of iniquity among the Romanes, is euill education: of long time there hath bin no man ready to instruct them in vertues, nor willing to reprehend their vices, the nourishment of these euils are the Tauerns, Dicing places, and brothell houses, of whiche Rome hath great store, & they greater store of guestes: so that to rid the publique weale of this dangerous infection, is fyrste and cheefelye to instruct the youth in good maners, and next to abate the number of these superfluous howses, or at the least, daylie to ouer-see their dooings.
                     Thus in breefe, I haue declared some of the hydden euilles, harboured in the bowels of Rome, which to reforme your owne eyes must be as ready to fynde them out, as your eares attentiue to heare euils reported: you must bee as well Informers of offenders, as Iudges of offences: for the desire of Iustice is to roote out iniquitie, and the office of Iustices to inquire after euil lyuers: And without al doubt, in this carefull proceedinge, in your visitations, you shall see sufficient example of sin, to occupie your Iudiciall places with correction. This vigilant care, will eternize your good beginnings with glorie, will establish prosperitye in the weale puplique, will comforte the good, and bridle the wicked: ytnot through the loue of vertue, yet for the chastninge of vice. Thus, you see it concerneth the inrichinge of

                        the common wealth, in the seruice where-of the bitternesse of death, should vnto you deeme pleasant: In particulers, it concerneth the prosperitie of your Children, Kinsfolke and Allies, for whose benefit you are borne to trauell: also it concerneth your owne honor, which you should holde more precious then lyfe: and therefore as your Soueraigne, we coniure you, and as fathers of the Common wealth beseeche you, that you wyll continue our good beginninge, with the execution of the Emperours directions: and so we end as we begun, the prosperitie of Rome, shal highly laude the gracious goodnes of the gods, & the greatnes of your wysdoms.
                     
                     VVHen the good Emperour, had in few words ended this waightie Oration, (or more properly graue admonition) the fatherly Senators admiring the sound iudgemēt of Alex. beinge of tendet yeares & vnexperienced, in pollices of gouernment, knew straight-waies, that there was a negligence in their administration of Iustice, which his minde (continually exercised for the benefyt of the publique weale) forsaw, and to the profit therof, in this louing maner the same discouered.
                     To witnesse that they throughly conceiued the intent of his reposed wordes, by their owne prudent deeds, they foorth-with wrought out the wholsome effects of his godly desire: and ye better to search the core of vice & iniquitie hid in the intrailes of Rome. These good Maiestrats vsed this pollicie, in disguysed habits they entred ye Tauerns, common tables, victuling houses, stewes & brothel-harbors, without controlemēt, they viewed ye behauiors of the people, that thei might the better vuderstand the ful of their abuses: & vpon diligent searche, what founde they?

forsooth, Rome like a painted strumpet. The great boast yt they but lately made of her reformation, had no better assurance their this, a few of the good sette forth their good dispositions at large, & many of the wicked, for a time helde in their lewde inclinations: but counterfetes wil vnto kinde, Copper may holde print but not bide tutch with golde: euen so these hypocrits, as place and opportunitie serued, bewraied their beastly natures. Among these tranions, Cosonage was esteemed lawful marchandise, & dicinge, faire pastune: lechery was held no sin, nor chastity, vertu: ruffens were honored, & the gods dispised: the mouth of vertu was locked, & vice spake through a trumpet. To be short, among them was no law but disorder, nor any thing publique but abhomination: neither possibli might it be otherwise: for by ye autho rity of Heliogabalus, ruffens, bawdes & suche other brothel birds, were made senators, yea, ye basest persons were maried to noble wemē, & they yt could set abroche most villanies, bare the greatest swayes: & wher such liberty is giuen to offend, sin is so sweete to ye flesh, yt there wil appeere no difference betweene men & beasts, saue yt men do exceede beasts in beastlines: and in this accordeth deuine Plato, who saith, yt those citties, in which 
                           •…
                        her are no seuere lawes to correct sin, ar rather forrests of monsters then places habitable for men, & wher as ther was this corruption in nature, there could be no alteratiō hoped for but by discipline, which the sequel well proueth.
                     The change of the gouernment, from a most vile vnto a most vertuous Emperour, purged simply, ye corruptiō of ye people, for althogh yt exercise of naughtinesse, were not so opē as before, yet ye euil disposed

knew where to stawle companions euen in the fore named Hell houses, and which was most to bee lamented, among the scum of the Cittie, I meane Ruffians, Bawdes, Brokers, Cheters, Shifters and others: in these fylthie places, worthye Gentlemen and substantiall Cittezens were daylye founde, the one through vnthristinesse to wast their patrimonie, the other by couetousenesse to purchase the Deuill and all.
                     When the graue Senatours, had entred into the depth of these foule vlcers of the Publique weale, they founde that Dice, Drunkennesse and Harlots, had consumed the wealth of a great number of ancient Gentlemen, whose Purses were in the possession of vile persons, and their Landes at morgage with the Marchants, and how both the one and the other, were confederate to spoyle these Gallantes. They truly certifyed the Emperour, the dangerous estate of the Common wealth, how that by the corruption of these houses, the Gentlemen had made this exchaunge with vise persons, they were attyced with the Gentlemens brauerie, and the Gentlemen disgraced with their bea
                           •…
                        ly maners: And somuch the case was the more to be pitied, for that the remedie was to be doubted: for al-be-it their infections grew by the fylthie conuersation with 
                           •…
                        affens, Bawdes, and suché braue baggages, whiche was harde to be cured, that which should comforte them in well dooinge, I meane their Landes, were in the possession of the Marchantes, who of the gaine of their bargen will wage sreendes to countenaunce their deceitfull dealinges, and then let them backe

their worst, their aduersaries will byte them, with their owne teeth. Thus, poore Gentlemen, they are sure to impaire their liuinges: how-be-it (perhaps) they amend theyr liues.
                     When the good Emperour, had attentiuely herd this (lamentable) report, hee foorth-with made this short answer.
                     
                        Graue Fathers, you haue certifyed vs no more, then by reason we sensibly foresaw: it is therefore now conuenient, that we by seueritie pluck vp the roots of wickednesse, which by sufferaunce are growen to mightye bodies of sin. Therfore our pleasure is, that by expresse Commaundement, the Cittizins of Rome be-warned to appeare (to morrowe) be-fore vs, in the Theater of Rome, where they shall openly know their faultes: and by the graces of the immortall Gods, and counsell of our graue Senate, wee shall set downe remedies for this daungerous mischiefe.
                     
                     This reposed speache of the Emperour, promysed good successe to his graue determinations: in to muche, as the Senators settled in this hope, made (forthwith) Proclamation of the Emperours Commaundement.
                     And at the appointed time, the grauer sort of the Cittizins, with a multitude of the Communaltie being assembled, the Emperour and a chosen company of Senators, with a sterne countenaunce passed by the people, and mounted in the Chayre of Maiestie, as one distempered with a great passion, with an angrie Countenaunce and a still tongue, hee setled his eyes vpon the Cittizins: And not-with-standing they saluted hym with many dutifull acclamatious:

                        as, Liue long, O noble Emperour, the chosen of the Goddes, the Glory of the world, the Soueraigne of Kynges and prosperytie of Roome: yet he seemed neuer a whytte the more affable, as wyllynge they should knowe that his wisdome had searched their corupt consciences, & (therfore) little regarded their dutiful gratulations: In the end, when the regarde of his displeased Countinaunce, had made them scilent with

If we shuld salute you, as Senators, your own consciences wold witnesse that we mocked you: for the good Senators, trauell for the benefite of the Publique-weale, and you (only) labour for priuate lucre. It were ridiculous to call you Gentlemen: for they, by their magnanimous Vertues, inlarge the boundes of the Empyre, and you, thoughe you haue cra

to be called, good people of Roome? Beleeue me, this is no proper Title for you: for they and you differ in conditions, as good doth from bad. Those Cittizyns or good people of Roome, by their Vertues, crowned Roome with the Honour of a Cittie, and more, with this Title: The Head of the Worlde: For, as diuine PLATO saith: it is not sumptueus Buildynges, that giueth name of a Cittie, but the Cruilytie and worthinesse of the Cittyzyns: And on the contraryparte, you pollute Roome with so many abhominations, as where in times past, she hath ben called the head of the world, she may now be as aptly called: the tayle of iniquitie: If none of all these titles belong vnto you: what name shuld we then giue you? you be of Rome: lyue in Roome, and haue your sustenance from Rome: all this hath Moathes in cloath, Canker rust in Iron, & Caterpillers in

The iyke doth the Caterpyller amonge Fruict, and with continuance, the Canker-rust in Iron. And you, that denoure the wealth of the CITTIE, dwell vppon the Possessions of

the Gentlemen, and oppresse the multitude with bondage: what gayne you by this? By Crueltie, you purchase hatred of your Neighbours, and the Ambitious, wyll enuie your aboundance of wealth: and then, this followeth: If they can not be strengthned with forein power, your familiars, wyll invade you with ciuil discention: For, among those that haue liued prodigally, this rule is obserued: whē their Purses are emptie, their heads are occupied with a thousand mischiefes, to com passe a newe supply: And (which is most to be feared,) they be not so perrillous cunnyng in their practises, as they are Deuillysh resolute in their Executious: If they sell you their landes, for money to spend riotously, whē that help is past, they wyl cut off your heads, fyre your Houses, and sacke this famous Cittie, to susteine their lasciuious humoures: For (without speciall grace) in Pryde and want, cause of Sedition. prowd minds, want can not suppresse desire to spend: You haue reade the experience in the Historie of vnthriftie CATTILINE and his Confederats, how he murdered the worthiest Cittezins, without mercie, made spoyle of their Gooddes without lawe, and beseaged Roome with a shrewde daunger: you are lyke to be partakers of their Afflictions, vnlesse you bee more moderate in gayning of Gentlemens liuyngs, and they lesse riotous in spendynge of your money. When PHILIP Kyng of MACEDONS, made warre vppon the PERSIANS, hauing intelligence, that they abounded in all maner of delicate vyandes, sumptuous Garments and wastful expences: he foorth with retyred his Army, and said: it was needelesse too make warre vpon those, that within a while, would cut one anothers throates. And truely, though PHILLIP

his answere were short, his iudgement was waightie: for as mightie Ryuers wyll soone run drie, when their noorishyng Spryngs are turned another way: so wealthy Citties, can not, but be subuerted, when euery man doth cleane contrary to his function. Among the Phylosophers, MAN is called, MICROCOSMOS, or a little worlde: for that in him is figured, a Modell of the glorie therof. If he resemble the whole worlde, it were an absurditie too make him a Figure of a welgouerned Cōmon-wealth: a man consisteth of diuers members, as head, body, Armes, legges. &c. So doth a good Common-wealth, of diuers estates: as of a Kyng as Supreame-head and Cōmaūder: of godly Prelates, as the heart and nooryshers of deuine vertues: of graue Iudges, Maiestrates and Counsellers, as the body and strength of Common prosperytie: of worthy Gentlemen, as the Armes, hands and executioners of the Maiestrates graue pollycies: of aduentrous Marchauntes, as the legges and trauaylers into forreigne countreyes, for their owne Countreyes cōmodytie: of Plowmen, and inferiour people, as the feete, which must run at the cōmaundement of euery other member. I say, where all these estates, dutifully, doo their Offices: where the Prince doth (iustly) commaunde: the Maiestrates (aduifedly) direct: and inferiour Subiectes (faythfully) obey: there, where this Concorde is, peace and prosperytie, floorysheth in their Citties, and feare, pineth the enuie of their borderyng enemies. On the contrary parte, where the head is crowned with a Pantofle, as the Sub iect of the vnconstant multitude: where the passages of the heart, whiche is the Organe of the Soule, are fixed with the continuall exercise of sinne, (the Figure that

the Prelates sownde Doctrine, are but wordes of warnyng, and no causes of amendment: Where the brest and bodie lyes naked to euery peryl, I meane, the good Maiestrates, are neither reuerenced, feared, nor obayed: Wherethe handes are bownde to the knees, in token, that the Gentlemen are thrawle to the Marchantes:
                     Where, on the knees is fastened a Cap and a feather, and about the legges, a Swoord and a Target buckled, in signe, that the Cittizyns desire the honour they can not gouerne, and leaue their

I say: as a man thus deformed, buckled and bownd on a heape, would soone perysh, for want of sustenance: euen-so, a Common-wealth, thus confused, would soone be confownded, for lacke of good Order.

                     The first Erector of the Romayn walles, was ROMVLVS, yet Roome was nothyng so much bound vnto him, for the envyronyng of her fayre buildynges, with strong Bulwarkes, as in appoinctyng offices, orders and lawes among the people, to gouerne them in peace and prosperytie: This Romulus, (that Roome might prosper,) hastened the death of his Brother REMVS, an Act (simply) considered by Nature, very impious, and the vengeance of detestable crueltie: but the seditious disposition of Remus well pōdred, necessytie approoued the seuerytie of ROMVLVS, to be perfect Iustice.

Your aboundaunce, can not defende Forreigne Inuasion, when the Gentlemens hartes are nipped with want: nay, it is to be feared, that Enuie and Necessytie, will make them to ioyne with the Enemie, to be reuenged of your Cruelties, or too be relieued of your superfluyties.
                     HEREWITH, the Multitude cried out, alowde: Accursed be he, and vnworthie the name of a Citizyn of Rome, that, by vnsatiable Coueitousnes and Vsurie, seeketh this publique desolution: whatsoeuer is thus (vnlawfully) gotten, shalbe restored backe: Hereafter, such vnprofitable members, shal be bridled: Liue vertuous Emperour, and what lack ye finde in vs, refourme it, and we wyll obey you: and he that doth resist, let him be slaine, and buried in Tyber: Your vertue hath restored vs to lyfe, that weare dead: vnto Lybertie, that were in thraldom: vnto Honour, that were dishonoured. In Gouernaunce, you be our Father, whome we well reuerence: by free election, our Emperour, whom we wil obay: & in wisdome our soundest Iudge, whose com maūdemēts & coūsels, we wil execute, as generall Lawes. ¶ Hereat, the Emperour relented, and with much paine, retayned the teares of his eyes, and (in the ende) comforted thē, wt this Conclusion.

                     I Am right glad, that your Protestation declareth, that you yet hold some portion of Vertue: which giueth vs hope, that the renown of this Noble Realme, begunne by Romulus, shall not ende in you: And if you be constant in this affection, we trust, right shortly, to make the Fame therof equall in estimation, with the Raignes of any of our Progenitours. And now, I haue fownd agayne your old name wherby I wyll call you.
                     Ye Children and Successours of the vertuous Romaynes: I say, you victorious people, braunches of Romulus, subduers of Realmes, patternes of vertue, and prowesse to all the world, mittigate your couetous appetites, abandon excessiue Vsurie, exceede not the boundes of your popular state, be charitable, and mercifull vnto your owne Countrey-men, where their necessitie may be relieued with your abundance: Be you ashamed, that labourers, and rude people, should condemne you of crueltie, for destroying of your Gentlemen (the chiefe ornament, and defence of this noble Cittie.) Remember, that if the state of Senators do decaye, the most vertuous of the Gentlemen are elected in their places: So you, that shall equall them in vertue (for your substance onely cannot make you gentle) shall be aduaunced vnto the state of Gentlemen, according to your deme

His Charyot was sometyme drawen with tame Lions, sometimes with Elephantes, and sometimes with marueilous faire Women. The Ringes which he drewe off his fingers, hee neuer put on againe. The vessels of golde and siluer, wherein he was serued, was euermore the fees of his seruitors. Suche huge prodigalitie was ioined with his incomparable pride. His gluttonie, & voluptuousnes was so great, as neere the Sea, his whole houshold was fed with most daintie fowles: and beeing farre within lande, they were all serued with all maner of fishes, by Poste brought alyue from the Sea: Sometime he had for a generall seruice, pasti

He so much esteemed of thinges that were deare and rare, that hearing there was but one Phaenix in the worlde, hee offered twoo thowsand Markes to haue it to hys Dinner.
                     His lecherie was so vnsatiable, and withal so vnclean, as common ciuilitie forbiddeth the report.
                     His Pusalanimitie was such, as he studied how to become a woman, and of moste notorious Strumpets, and Bawdes, hee erected a Senate, and in a Capitoll, for the nonce, hee made vnto them manie Orations, and called them his Companions, and fellowe Souldiers.

                     He cruelly put to death many worthie personages, & amongst the people many times let loose Lions, Beares, and other cruell Beastes. In fine, when his monstrous pryde, prodigallitie, and lecherie, had consumed all his own treasure, necessitie, & a naughtie disposition, made him to sell the offices of Iustice. But his owne familiar Seruantes and Souldiers, wearie of his abhominations, slew him: & drawing his horrible Carren with hooks through the Cittie, they tyed him to a stone of greate waight, and threw him into Tyber, to the end so vile a bodie should neuer be buried: Yet, your owne eies are Iudges that I say the truth. His death and funerals was as vile and filthie, as, what I haue saide of his life, was sumptuous and rich.
                     I haue laide the miserie of his death before your eyes, that you should expell the vices of his life forth of your harts. It was the due of his beastlines, and will be the reward of your insolent liuing without amendment.
                     You are yet yong, & by prowesse may recouer more then you haue by prodigalitie wasted: A vertuous end repaireth the dishonors of a vicious life: But shame lyueth, when lewd men are dead. A prodigall and voluptuous humor, I know is hardly purged, bicause the norishments are many and sweete. But when I consider, that you are Gentlemen, I straightwaies hope, that you will easilye subdue these affections. There is nothyng more pretious to man then life, nor nothing more fearfull then death.
                     
                        
Yet the noble Romaine Gentlemen your auncestors, in actions of honour, preferred the last before the first. If you be heires of their vertues, Vsurers cannot purchase that patrimonie: And therefore, great is our hope, that you will bridle meane affections, when they contemned the greatest. ROMVLVS with a weake strength, and inuincible courage, first buylded this famous Citie, and of his name shee is called to this daye Roome. Numa Pompilius that succeeded him, both inlarged the boundes, and strengthened her, with manie good lawes and orders: And in processe of time, the wisdome of the Maiestrates, and valiancie of her Gentlemen, made Rome, The Soueraigne of Citties, the Beautie of the earth, and Empresse of the whole world: And so to this daye had remained, had not the horrible vices of her Emperors Nero, Caligula, Domitian, Comodus, and Heliogabalus, eclipsed her glorie, and polluted her people with abhominations: But vertue is able to perfect more then vice hath deformed.

                     Of the great VVisdome of ALEXANDER, in electyng of Graue Counsellers, Officers, and Admynistrators of Iustice.
                     
                        THE Noble and vertuous Emperour (prudently) forsawe, that the seuerest lawes, were (without execution) but like vnto painted Fire, which giueth no heat: or (as the Phylosopher, Cleanthes sayth:) Lyke vnto Cobwebs, through which, the Hornets breake when the small Flies are intangled. And (truely) without due Administration, law is like to a Backswoorde, the edge wherof, smiteth the poore, and the blunt backe, the higher powers. But to auoyd this parcialytie: the good Alexander, made choyce of such worthy Maiestrates, as (playnly) refuted this Maxime of Aristotle.
                        
                           Amor et odium, et proprium commodum,

                              ¶ In Englysh, thus:
                              
                              ¶ Loue, Hate, and priuate gayne,
                              From vpright trueth, the Iudge doth alwayes straine
                           
                        
                     
                     None of these Assections, could (neyther) blinde their eyes, nor binde their handes: They measured Iustice, neither by the mightinesse nor meanenesse of the Person, but by the equitie of the cause: and it stoode them in hande, to deale thus vprightly: for if any corruption were founde in their Iudgements, the Emperour himselfe, did (seuere) Iustice vppon the vniust Maiestrate, that abused his Auctorytie,

and iniured the people: let Vetronius Turinus, be example, for many.

                     Thus, no knowen Offender, escaped the vengeance of his seuerytie: and (which won him as much loue, as his Iustice did feare,) he incouraged & comforted good & vertuous men, with many great gifts and fauours.
                     ¶That Rome might prosper, by the confusion of vice: First, he ordayned (accordyng to the counsell of Conseruators and their chardge.

¶ Item: That the Maidens, duryng the said Age, were brought vp in shamefastnes, humblenes, and Education of maydens the exercise of Huswifrye: and that they should not be seene foorth of their Fathers-houses, but (only) in the Temples.
                     ¶ Item: their charge was, to controwle Howsehoulders of euery degree, if there were fownde any Riotous house holders excesse in their fare, or cost vpon their owne, or their Wyues Apparayle, more then by the Lawes, was limitted: or if they were Company-keepers with any riotous or dishonest person.

                     ¶ Item: To be Iudges of these Officers, as also of the behauiours of all the people of Rome, sauing Cersors, and their office. the common people, were they Senatores, Gentlemen or Citizens. This prudent Emperour appointed two of his priuie Counsel, worthy and graue Senators, to be Censors in Rome, whose names were Fabius Sabinus, and Catillius Seuerus. The office of the Censors, were to note the manners of euerie person, aboue the degree of the common people.
                     So that if a Knight, Iudge, or Senator, did any thing vnseeming the Honour of their Degree, their charge was, to degrade hym of his office, or Dignitie. In whiche, they vsed suche rigour, as no man might (lawfully) boast of fauor. In so much, as ye Emperars Pallace was not free from their iurisdiction. For they meeting with Aurelius Philippus, (who was sometime the Emperours schoolmaster, and after wrote his life) riding in a Chariot, looking to be saluted as a Senatour, they foorth with executed an auncient law vpon the said Philippus: which was, that no bond-man, although hee were manumissed, should be a Senatour: And at that time, it was lawful for no person vnder the degree of a Setour

to ride in a Chariot. Philippus was sometime a bond-man, and therefore, for breach of this lawe, the Censors sent him first to prison, and after, sorbad him to come to the Emperors pallace, but (onelie) a foot, and his copped Cappe vpon his head: which fashiō was o
                           •…
                        elie vsed of them that were enfranc
                           •…
                        sed. Some of the Noble-men thought, the Cenfors dealt verse sharplie with Philippus, considering, that hee was a man of much honestie, and great learning, and so certefied the Emperour. But the Emperour approoued their Iustice, and answered:
                     
                        If the common wealth may euermore haue such officers, in short space, there shall be found in Roome more men worthie to be Emperours, than I (at my first comming) found good Senators.
                     
                     And vndoubtedlie, where the offences of the best are neuer pardoned, the worst will amend for feare of extreeme vengeance. The proofe appeareth in Alexanders gouernment: who (by the seuere executiō of the lawes, so brideled the dispositions of the wicked, that it may be saide, they grew to be vertuous rather by custome, then good inclination. Yea, it is written, that his seueritie thus much profited: As leading a great armie against Artaxerses, the Persians, said, he had brought an armie of Senatours, rather than of Soldiours, when at his comming to ye Empire, the Senatours (manie of them) were as dissolute as common Soldiers. And one especiall A wise pollicie of Alexander. cautle hee vsed in the searche of mens behauiours, hee woulde manye tymes in disguysed habyte, with diuers others by hym especiallye elected,

take vpō him the Office of the Censors: and in euery corner, he had (secretly) suche faythfull Explorers, as mens proper Houses, were no Couerts for naughtie practises, nor the Senat-house, for partial Iudge mentes. And (by this Pollycie) he discouered many naughtie matters, besides cōmon trespasses: as the Treason of Oninius, the false accusation of Geminus, by his Lybertines, or Copyholders: as (also) of the mortall mallice of Duillius and Gorta, towardes the said Geminus. In so much, as the people, seyng nothyng that was euyl, could escape his vengeāce, al men indeuored to do well, to purchase his fauour.

One said to Antisthenes: The people speaketh much good of you: Why? saide he: what hurt haue I done? As who should say: they seldome praise, but suche as do euil: No Ethnicke, deserued to lyue, better then Socrates, yet the people would haue hym dead. The Athenians had a Lawe, euerie yeare, by the most voyces of the people, for ten yeares, to banysh two of their principall Maiestrates: On a tyme, a poore man, came with a white Paper in his hande to Aristides, the iust, and willed him to write: Banish Aristides.

                     When Cicero sawe that Caesar was in hye fauour with the people of Rome, he cryed out: It is great pitie, that the affabilitie of Cesar, should be the ouerthrow of the Weale-publique. And (truely) Cicero, prophesied rightly:

                        or, by their fauour, Caesar iudged the Iudgementes of the Senate, and sent the good and graue Cato to Prison, whose vertues, obtayned reuerence of the woorst liuers.
                     But (notwithstandyng) the Affections of the multitude, coueiteth their owne vndoynges, yet their incouragement proceedeth of greater capacyties: And (therfore) the redy way to keepe them in awe, is (seuerely) to punysh their Chief-taynes,
                     In all tumultes, it is (euidently) seene, that if their Captaynes yelde, they ronne away: if their Incouragers be dismayde, they sing, Peccaui: do Iustice vpon the great Offenders, and the meaner wyll soone amend: Alexander (in his Gouernment) found it true: who, in the Execution of the Lawes, made no difference of persons: saue, that, to the inferiour people, he was (euermore) most mercifull.

                        IT is sufficiently expressed, that, by the vertue, diligence, and wisdom, of the right Noble Emperour, Alexander: Rome, (the most ouglye, and monsterous Common-wealth of the world, so wa

                      she deformed, with horrible & beastly vices, fostered by Heliogabalus, & other wicked Emperours,) was brought vnto such perfection, as she might (lawfullye) bee intituled: The Temple of the Goddes: The Fowntayne of Vertue, and, The Nurce of Learnyng: so free was the Exercise of Pietie, Iustice, The woundes of a Comon wealth Temperance, and all other Deuine, Morall, and Heroycall vertues. In curyng of which daungerous Infirmyties of the Cōmon-wealth, Alexander perfourmed the Offices of a skylfull Phisition and Surgion: he did not (ignorantly) apply Medicine, to the outwarde sore, vntyll he had searched the inward cause: He founde, the outwarde woundes of the Weale-publique, was Pride, Prodigalytie, Dicynge, Drunkennesse, Lecherie, Vsurie, Coueitousnes &c. The suppressing of which Passions, consisted not (alone) in chastisment of Offenders: He (prudently) foresawe, that ye Boatman lost much labor, that with a Dish, stoode all day ladyng out of water, when a quarter of an howres worke, wold

mende the breache of his Boate, whiche was the cause, althoughe the water were the annoyance: he knew, that euery Ryuer had a Spryng, euery Disease, a nooryshing Humour, and euery vice, a special succour: Reason instructed him, that no Thie

Shame wold delay Lechery But for Tauerns and tiplyng Boothes, Drunkardes should be sober against their wils: But for Ordinarie tables, Dicers should (many times) be idle, or better occupied then in swearyng and consumyng their Patrimonie: These causes beynge stopped, the vicious (perforce) must change their course. And therfore, the good Emperour, as the best remedie for the maladies of the Cōmon-wealth, purged Rome, of thease Sanctuaries of lewd and dishonest persons, as the perfect meane to cure their vile and naughtie dispositions. And (certaynly) his Gouernment, Order, and Discipline, may be, A Myrrour for Magistrates of all Citties: who are lyke to finde no lacke of Disorders, to exercise his Politique Orders: for, in the heart of the best gouerned Citties, Vice hath her Mansion, as a Core in the inward substance of the sowndest Quince. But, leauyng the Discouerie of the Infyrmities of Forreigne Citties, London, the Capitol Cittie of Englande and at this day, the Paragon of Christ endome,) prowdely beareth many a daungerous Infyrmytie, whiche, the Wisdome of the Maistrates, must (speedely) heale, or els, ouershortely, the wickednesse of her people, wyll abate her prosperytie.

                     For the saluynge of which, and all other Infirmyties, of the Common-wealth, her Godly wisdome, with the Publique assent of her Subiectes, established many Medicinable Lawes, whereby, all the priuye Maladies of the Cōmon-wealth, might receiue perfect cure, if the Penall Lawes were as seuerely punished, as they be (prudēfly) established.

the vndoing of himself, inricheth many. Thus, what may be best said of Prodigalyte, concludeth an vndoyng of him-self & posterytie. The famous Lawiet Vlpianus saith: the prodigal man, neither obserueth time, nor maketh end of riot, vntil riot hath, both cō

                        Socrates found that aboundance of wealth was the ouerthrowe of many common wealthes, and Socrates common wealth poore. therefore in his owne common wealth, he would haue the common people poore, and the rest not to haue too much: saying that wealth bred pride, and pride all mischiefes, when pouertie brought foorth Science, and all good Arts, and Science all maner of earthly happinesse.

But vnto this possibilitie of reformation, wise men are to giue light credence. Olde Iudge Chomley euermore aunswered naughtie liuers that sued for mercie, desiring him to regard the frailtie of young men, by the bolde and vnlawful actions of his owne youth, and by the testimonie of his grace, good fortune, and present authoritie, to conceiue hope or their amendement: O my friendes, quoth the Iudge, I tel you plainly, Iudge Chomleys aunswere to the

This notable Iudge in his aunswere was not short and sweete, but round and seuere. Great is the pitie that of twentie offenders there should but one become a good man. Howe high a worke were it then of charitie and mercie to preserue men from notable offences? Certainly farre greater, than to pardon offeders. For by the wisdome of the first, vice shall be driuen to her shifts, when the mildenesse of the seconde many times breedeth presumption. If the good magistrates of this Citie, vsed the diligence of the forereported Censors of Rome, in short space the case would be altered, and in time custome would make men honest, which without discipline can haue no beginning. There is an olde prouerbe, The eye of

And therfore in many wel gouerned cōmon wealthes, Citizens (to the ende they should onely imploi

                     It is alreadie showen, to what extremitie the better sort of these houses bring a great number of our flourishing Gentlemen. To what miserie the seconde sort (called ordinaries for Citizens) bring a great number of young merchauntes. Nowe remayneth the discouerie of the thirde sort Ordinaries for masterles mē, shifters, &c. of these hauntes, which are placed in Allies, gardens, and other obscure corners out of the common walks of the Magistrate. The dayly guests of these priuie houses, are maisterles men, needy shifters, theeues, cutpurses, vnthriftie seruants, both seruing men, and prentises. Heere a man may picke out mates for all purposes, saue such as are good. Heere a man may finde out Brauoes of Rome and Naples, who for a pottle of wine, will make no more conscience to kill a man, than a Butcher a beast, heare closely lie good fellowes,

that with a good Northren Gelding, will gaine more by a halter, than an honest yeoman will with a teame of good horses. Heare are they, that will not let to deceaue their father, to robbe their brother, and fire their neighbours house for an aduauntage. These frannions will not sticke to spende frankely, although they haue neither landes nor goods by the dead, nor honestie by nature. But how will this hould out? fire will consume wood without maintenance, and ryot a weake purse without supply. The Gentlemen (for the most) haue landes to make money, and young marchants waies to get credite, but the most of these idle persons haue neither landes nor credite, nor will liue by an honest occupation: forsooth they haue yet handes to filch, heades to deceiue, and friendes to receiue: and by these helpes, shift meetely badly well. The other vpon currant assurance, perhaps get money, for twentie markes or twenty poundes in the hundred. But these that worst may hould the candle, they vpon their owne, or maisters apparell, brasse, pewter, sheetes, shirts, &c. finde Brokers, or

And I pray to God, that in Cheape side, Brokers called cherishtheeues. and other principall streates, although gould, siluer, silkes and other costly merchandise be openly in the shops, that in many mens cofers there

A Iuish vsurie, high time to bee rooted out of a Christian gouernement. By ouer long sufferaunce howe much London hath blemished her auncient vertues, and indaungered her peace and prosperitie, is not to be recounted. In the time of King Henrie the third, the good citizens of London in one night slew fiue hundred Iewes for that a Iewe tooke of a Christian a pennie in the shilling vsurie: and euer after got them banished the Citie: if the like Iustice were done vpon Iuish Christians, London would haue manie houses emptie, and her Churches and Churchyeardes would be too scant to receiue dead carrions. Truely these Atheists deserue worse than Iewes, for they more sharply execute the trade of Iewes. The Iewes spoile not one an other, but Christians, whom they esteeme as dogges, when these counterfets make no difference of persons. The good Maiestrates must ouerlooke this euill, or else the euill will ouerrule their prosperitie. It is a great miracle (but that God is mercifull) that this Citie is not alwaies greeuously afflicted with the plague, when sacred is the authoritie that sayth, The plague shall not depart the house of the swearer. I imagaine that disers cure one poyson with an other, who gape so wide to blaspheme God, as they swallowe the Deuil into their bowels, vpon whom no plague but hell fire will fasten. How needefull a thing is it to looke vnto these places where this outrage

is done vnto God. Thinke you they may not be made instruments to nourish traiterous practises? The conspiracie of Madder and Barloe, was hatched in a tabling house, in the white fryers. Where is the currant of newes but in tabling houses? forraine explorers and faulse subiectes, there heare much matter intreated at counsell bordes. Where is a desperate Athiest like vnto harebraine Someruile so ready to be found, as in a tabeling house? Obstinate Papists that dare not liue in the countrey for feare of the statute, monethly shift their lodgings, and without suspition heere dayly receiue their dyet. Launce an olde feastred sore, and you are like to finde corruption more than of one humour. But admit they proue no baites for such purposes: they are the sinkes of the forereported mischiefes. The vndoing of many, and the honest gaine of no man. The Gentleman excuseth his repaire to them, because he keepeth no certaine house, and likewise alleadgeth conuersation of equals: but as he findeth no thrift in the first, so he is often deceiued in the seconde. A tabling house is like vnto a strumpet, who is readie to receiue euery mans money. And many times men of great worshippe, are bearded, and braued, with inferiours to some of their seruantes. The Gentleman of Naples is highly to be commended, for this honorable disposition, how meane so euer his liuing be, yet he will furnish his owne table: so he both auoydeth the controulement of superiours, and the checkemate The honorable disposition of the Napolitan gentleman. of inferiours. Would our English gentlemen did the like, they would like very well of the

change. By this frugallitie, the Napolitane liueth Caueliero like with a 100. crownes a yeare, and our ryot maketh no showe of so much a moneth. But you will say they starue themselues: but did euer any see a man to die of hunger, where meate was to be sold, if he had gaie clothes to his backe, it seemeth he contenteth nature, which is plentie ynough, we for our glutonie are euerie where called English bellies. Very few of our gentlemē die old men by inordinate feading, our memorie, wit, and minde, which is immortall, is daylie dulled, weakened and almost slaine by surfets. Let vs excuse the matter as we please, wee receiue no better remedie by our excuse, than Mahomet had for the fawling sicknesse, by coloring his disease, in giuing out that his passion proceeded of the brightnesse of an Angell, which in those fittes reuealed heauenly matters vnto him. But if men will deceiue them selues by deluding others, they shall finde had I wist a bitter pill to digest. I neede shewe no other examples than the daylie falles of young Gentlemen that trust to the fortune of these intising dicing houses, where vertue is shut in the cole seller, and vice and all cosoning villanies, set in the chiefe places of the hall. And therefore happie is he, that is either aduised by good counsell, or warned by other mens harmes.
                     A care to continue ye prosperitie of this famous Citie, will no doubt cause her Capitall magistrates shortly to looke into the behauiours of riotous Citizens, their vnthriftinesse consumeth more than their owne goods, and vndoeth many,

that trauaile painefully for their liuing. The example of monethly iustice, sufficeth to dismay the third sort of vnthriftie liuers. There are more executed from Newgate and the Marshalsies, than in three of the greatest Cities of Fraunce, and yet I truely say, that more offenders are fauourably quitted, and pardoned in London in one moneth, than in Paris in a whole yere, so exceeding The exceeding mercie of ye Queenes Maiestie eternized by straungers. great is the mercie of our most good Queene Elizabeth, the remembraunce whereof may not passe without zealous thankes vnto God for her thrise excellent Maiestie, least straungers condemne her naturall subiects of ingratitude, who to eternize this pretious vertue of mercie, rooted in the magnanimous heart of her excellencie, in commemoration thereof, haue written many learned bookes. Others haue raised disputationn, whether it be a vertue more holy, in her Maiestie, or daungerous for her true subiects: for feare least her clemencie extend vnto persons of the disposition of the frosen snake, which the pitifull husbandman cherished by the fire, vntill she offered to sting his children: and truely whether presumption or necessitie were the cause, I leaue to iudge: but I craue Gods wrath as iustice, if I speake not the trueth: In Rome, euen in that Rome, where the Pope and her woorst enemie raigneth, among English fugitiues, not woorthie of the benefite of her good subiects, plentie, peace and prosperitie. There was (which with mine owne eares I heard) that wished imprisonment in the Fleete at the Queenes mercie, rather than libertie in Rome. It is apparant that her

Highnesse mildenes exceedeth, and it seemeth that the Popes bountie is not verie plentiful, saue vnto such, as rather carrie sedition than zeale in their countenance. When such as cannot be contented to be good subiects, affie more in her clemencie (if shame held thē not backe) than in the Popes holinesse, for all his golden showes. In my booke entituled, The blessings of Peace, this digression shall be liuely set foorth. In the meane space & many happy yeres after, I humbly beseech Almightie God to forget our vnworthinesse, by remembrance of her worthinesse, that she may in al felicitie still raigne among vs as the image of his glorie, and the comfort of all true Christians. Amen.
                     
                     Againe to my purpose: Though there cannot be too much good spoken of her Maiesties gratious & sweet mercie, yet seueritie may no wayes be termed crueltie, so that no more than Lawe be ministred to notable malefactors. London is so plentifull of notorious couseners, cheters, and dishonest liuers, and withall so blemished with heynous cousenages and deceites, as a young man, vnlesse he haue an olde mans experience, can hardly auoide their snares.
                     Many newe kinde of shiftes, which none but the Deuill could inuent, and verie Atheistes execute, by the wisedome of graue Maiestrates haue beene syfted foorth: wherein reuerent personages were in danger of dishonour, and innocentes in hazarde of death. It is a matter offresh memorie. The publicke mischiefe that of late yeares was hatched in these wicked houses, and growento the great losse, hinderance, and halfe vndoing of more than two hundred Gentlemen, honest citizens and yeomen, yet God which is iust, hath rewarded many of the deceiuers

according to their euill deseruings.
                     No man was euer assaulted with a more daungerous strategeme of cosonage than my selfe, with which my life & liuing was hardly beset. No man hath more cause to thanke God for a free deliuery than my selfe, nor anie man euer sawe, more suddaine vengeance inflicted vpon his aduersaries, than I my selfe of mine: as liuely appeareth in the ende of my booke intituled The rocke of regarde, imprinted many yeares past.
                     And although to cure the extremitie I then fared as a man sore scalded with fire, which in hope of ease leapeth into colde water, which presently stripeth off his skin. So I that had experience of strangers huge deceite, thought that the pleasing perswasion of neare friendes, would turne to a comfortable remedie, but I finde the olde Larkes song true: There is no trust in faire words, nor assurance in natures obligations.
