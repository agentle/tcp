               WHylom as old
Bookes maketh
mencion,
whan the noble
& famous
citie of Rome
was most shining
in his felicitie,
and flouring in hys glorye,
like as it is remembred in the bookes
of old antiquitie / in the pryme
temps of his foundacion / whan the
walles wer reysed on height by the
manly and prudēt diligence of Remus
and Romulus: the citie stode
vnder gouernaunce of kinges / tyl
vnto the time that Tarquine, sōne
of Tarquine the proude, dydde the
great outrageous offēce vnto Lucres / wyfe
of the woorthye Senatour
Collatine. In punishynge of

which trespace by the manlye pursuite
of Collatines kinred and ful
assent of all the Cenate: the name
of kynges ceased in the Citie of
Rome for euermore, and al the royal
stocke of the forsaide Tarquine
was proscript & put in exile. And
after by the prudent aduise of the
Cenate: the citie was gouerned betwene
Councellers / and so continued
vnto the time that Pompei the
proude was repayred home again
from the conquest of Tyre / whych
by force he had made subiecte vnto
the Empyre of Rome, where as wt
great worthines of fame hee was
receiued. So that for his great noblenes
he was chosen one of the .iii
for to gouerne the city: assigned to
hym other twoo full renowmed of
knighthoode / Iulius Cezar, and
Marcus Crassus, & thus was the
name of coūsellers turned into the

name of Dictatours, which was yt
time an office partinent to princes
to gouerne other. And for a special
cause this office & this occupacion
of a Dictatour, by assent of all the
whole Cenate was committed vnto
thre, that if one offended, ye other
twaine should be mightie & strong
to correct the thirde. And another
cause was this: while that twayne
were occupied in warre outward / 
the third should gouerne at home.
And thus al the while they wer of
one hart / of one assent / and void of
variaunce among them selues / the
nobles of Rome floured in prosperitie,
but as sone as false couetous
brought in pride & vain ambicion,
the cōtagious Serpent of diuisiō
clipsed & appalled her woorthines,
cōcluding soothly as in sentence yt
euery kyngdome proued by diuision / 
is conueyed to his destruction.

And so for the surquedous pride on
the partie of Iulius, and after of
the said citie of Rome: the contagious
couetous entermedled wyth
enuye, on the partye of Pompey:
made the famous citie of Rome fullye
waste and wylde / not onelye of
their inumerable treasour, but caused
them also to be ful baren and de
solate of their men / where to fore of
worthines, of knighthode / & of chiualry
they wer incomparable. And
finallye, the false diuision amonge
them selues, was more importable
vnto thē, and caunsed more the ruine
of the Citie / than when they had
warre with all the worlde / lyke as
this litle storie compendiously shal
deuise. And to conuey briefely the
processe of this ma
                  ••
               er: ye shal first
vnderstād that Marcus Crassus
was sēt to the par
                  •
               ies of the North
wyth syxe legions of Knyghtes against

the kyng of Parthes. And
the manly man Iulius Cezar with
other syxe legions of people was
sent downe, passing the great bondes
of Lombardye / dyscendynge
downe by highe Alpies / and auayling
downe by the large plage of
Germanie and of Almaygne, tyll
by conquest b
                  •
                his manly 
                  •
               orce and
his mortal swoorde he broughte all
Fraunce into subiection / and al the
land of Burgoyn, Brabant, Flaunders,
and Holand. In which conquest
he continued tyll almoste the
space of his Lustre was wasted out
that is to say, that was the space limited
of the Romaines, the whiche
was called a Lustre, whiche is accompted
the space of fiue yere, and
who so euer passed that space by occasion
of anye conquest, and not repayred
againe at his time set and
limited of fiue yere: he was foriudged

anone and dempt as enemye &
rebel vnto the noble city of Rome.
But this famous and manly man
Iulius / prudentlie deming in his
opinion that time lost while ye Fortune
is blādesshing and fauorable
throughe the contagious occasion
of necligence and of sloth / is afterward
ful hard for to be recouered.
Wherefore of knighthod and manly
prowesse he did set ye Romaines
statutes aside, and fully purposed
in his noble and knightly hart for
to passe the bondes and the space
of his Lustre, and to enforce hymselfe
with his

                / and ouersayle
by force the west partie of our Occean.
But for all hys surquedous
pryde hee was twyse beaten of at
his arriuall, by the woorthynes of
the Britaine king called Cassibelan.
And playnly withoute fauour

to declare and specifie the truth, he
might neuer attain to ariue at his
lust and pleasure, tyll this manlye

               tye
and concorde stoode vndefoyled
and vndeuided in the bondes of
Britaine, the mightie conquerour
Iulius was vnable and impotent
to vanquishe them.
            By which ensample ye may euidently
consider and see, that diuision
lyke as is specified to forne, is
originall cause in Prouincies and
Regions of all destruction. For
whan Iulius by fauour of Androgenes
recouered ariuall into Britaine,
shortlye after Cassibelan the
manlye king / proudly and kinghtlye
met wyth him / betwene whom
there was a mortall warre.
            
               But like as it is especially remembred
and recorded by the wrytinge
of the most worthye and graduate
Clarke Eusebius, that same daye
when Iulius and Cassybelan me
                  •
               
in the fielde / this foresaid Cassybelan
had a famous and a passynge
manly mā to his brother, the which
with his bloody mortal swoord neuer
ceased to 
                  •
               lea and oppresse the
proud Romaine knightes / so farre
forthe that they fled and eschewed
his swoord as the death. For as he
went there was no resistence, and
this continued so long that the Romaynes
were impotent to resist.
But oh alas when he was wearied
of fight, it befel casually of fortune
which is ay contrary and peruerse
that he of auenture met wyth thys
manly man Iulius, and bothe two
like as made is mencion fared as

by dispocion of fate Iulius with
an vnware stroke of his dreadfull
sword, rose him a twaine. And because
the storie maketh no mencion

                  •
               ight: I

complaine, by whose death Iulius
was made victorious / and Cassibelan
brought to subieccion vnto
the Empire of Rome, & constreyned
by Cezar to pay for his truage
thre thousand pound euery yeare.
And in the signe of this conquest &
victorie Iulius Cezar edified in
this land for a perpetual memorie
to put his name in remembraunce,
the castel of Douer and Caūturburie / 
Rochester / & the tower of London,
the castel and the towne of Cezarisbury,

which now is called Salesburie.
And moreouer (as sayth
mine Auctour) he edified Cezaris
Chester, that now is called Chichester,
and the castle of Exeter. And
in the mean while that Cezar thus
proudlie had wholie and entirelye
the gouernaunce of Brutes Albion,
his felow Marcus Crassus (of
whō tofore is made mencion) was

while he made most cruel warre agaynste

And for his gredie vnstauncheable

Thou haste thursted golde all thy
life / now drinke thy fill. Lo here ye
may consider and see the short and
the momentayne tyme transitorie

and not abyding of all the warryours.
And as the storie rehearceth
also, as for lamentable kalendes
of more infortune that after shuld
folowe: Iu
                  •
               ia the noble wyfe of
Pompey, and daughter to Iulius
died of a childe. For whyche cause
Pompeius pretended to fynde a
cause to reuoke Iulius agayne to
Rome by assent of al the Senate / 
to the entent that he shoulde come
in his owne persone to reuenge in
al hast the death of his felow Marcus
Crassus, as before is sayde so
vengeablie slaine in his conquest.
This 
                  •
               ame Pompey hauing a secret
dred in his cōceit lest yt Iulius
should waxe so mighty in his conquest
yt he shuld not be egall of power,
nor able to resist him in his repair,
& dreding also in his imaginaciō
lest yt Iulius wold of presūptuous
pride vsurpe by tirāny to take

vpon him the lordship and the dominacion
of Rome. But this manlie
man Cezar aduerting full prudently,
and perceiuing the fradul

at their request repayre home

the Snake of wanhope and of discord,
which caused eueriche to suspect
other, & thus began to kyndle
the fyre of enuie, enducing successiuelye
warre and debate amonge
them selues / and here vpon wythout
delay to execute their purpose / 
and euidently to shew the ende of
of their entent: Pompey & the Cenate
of one assent withoute respite

or deliberacion, foriudged Cezar
giltie, disobedient, rebel, and traitour
to Rome / and gaue vpon him
a sentence diffinitiue of exyle and
prescriptiō for euermore. But Iulius

that malicious conspiracye, that
Pompey and the Cenate wrought

of entent, didde sende his
Embassatours, not onely vnto his
sonne in law Pompey, but also vn
to al the woorthye court of the Cenate / 
and to all other of the Cityzens
of the citie / requyring & praying
theym of equitie / that for hys
meritorie desert they should not be
contrary against him nor for none

hym hys customable gwe

in possession of the Palme / and the
Triumph which so long by knightly
labour and manlye diligence he
had (for the encrease and the augmentacion
of the common profyte
of al the Empire of Rome) traueled
for. Then for to specifie and declare
the honoure and Triumphe
whylome vsed in Rome / firste ye
shal vnderstande that Triumphus
by description / is as much to saye
in English as a treble gladnes, or
els a singuler excellencie of ioye, in
three maner of wyse ordeyned for
Uictours, whyche throughe theyr
high renowne and manly prowesse
had broughte Regions and cityes
by way of knightly conquest to be
subiect and tributarie to the Empyre

of Rome. The first of the thre
worships done to a Conquerour,
was this: first at his repaire vnto
the citi / al the people of high estate
and of low shoulde with great ioy
and reuerence in their best and richest
aray, meete him on the waye / 
and this was the first. The second
was this, that al the prisoners and
they that were in captiuity / should
fetred and manacled go rounde about
enuiron his charret, some before
& some behinde. And the third
worship done vnto him was thys:
that he shoulde be clad in a purpurate
mante
                  •
               l of Iupiter as God / &
syt with a crowne of Laurer vpon
his head in a charet of gold / and aboute
his necke a maner of a circle
enuirō made of gold / in similitude
and likenes of a Palme. And if so
that his conquest were performed
and accomplished withoutes sword

or sheding of blood / than shoulde
the circle of the Palme be forged
without prickes or pynnes. And yf
so were that his victorie was finished
by the cruel fate of warre, thā
of custome this circle or his pectoral
was forged al ful of sharp pricking
thornes / to declare and specifie
that there is no conquest accomplished
fully to the ende by mediacion
of warre, without that ther be
felt and founde therein The sharpe
thornes of aduersitie, and that eyther
by deathe or els by pouertie.
And this royal and victorious charet
to forsaid, was drawē with .iiii.
white stedes through the most royal
stretes of the Citie to the Capitole,
he hauing a Ceptre in his hādful
richly deuised / and there vpon
in signe of victori an Egle of gold.
And to shew clerelie that al worldlie
glorie is transitorie and not abiding,

and euidently to declare that
in hyghe estate is no assuraunce / 
there was sette at the backe of the
Conquerour, behinde in the Charet,
the most vnlikelie person, and
the most wretche that in any countrey
might be founde / disfigured
and cladde in the most vglie wyse
that any man could deuise. And amyd
all the clamour and noyse of
the people / to exclude the false surquedie,
vaine glorie, and idle la
                  •
               d,

wretche shoulde of custome and of
con
                  •
               uetude smite the Conquerour
in the necke euer & vpon the head / 
and stondemele sayinge to hym in
Greke this word (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               )
whiche is to saye in oure Englishe
toung as (knovv thy selfe) whych
declareth vnto hym yt he nor none
other shuld for no such worldli glory
be 
                  •
               urquedous ne waxe proude.

And that day it was leful without
punishing to euerie man, of high estate
or of low / to saye to him that
was Uictor, what that he woulde / 
whether it were of honour or worshippe / 
of repre
                  •
               e or of shame. And
this was admitted for this cause / 
that he should truelie considre and
aduert that there is no earthly glorie
that fully may be assured without
daunger of fortune. And shortlie
to declare the differēce betwene
Triumphus and Trophe
                     •
                  m. Triumph
is a full and a complener ouercomming
of enemies bi battel,
and Troph is whan a man putteth
his enemies to flight wtoute stroke
of sword. But touching this honor
aforesaid whiche Iulius required
and asked of righte as for a gwerdon,
which him thought was meritory
and due vnto him. Anone this
foresaide Pompey with full assent

of all the Cenate, denyed all with
one voyce his request, and of one
accord answered againe, and sayd
him platlie he should not be accepted
there vnto no such honour / but
plainlie they bad him know that he
had rather deserued to be deade,
then to attain to any such worship,
aledging against him that he was
both rebel and traytour to the statutes
of Rome. And whan Iulius
clerely conceiued the short answer
of the Cenate and of this Pompey
to fore sayde, there kyndled a full
great hote burning fire of enuy in
his hart of the freting hate, specially,
that he bare in his breast for to
be reuenged of Pompey. And as
Lucan rehearseth in his poeticall
booke, the denyeng of this worship
to Iulius, was the chiefe grounde
and occasion of all the warre that
began in Rome / roote and begynning

also of al the contagious diu
                  •
               
               sion
among them selfes. But so as
Lucan liketh to reherce and specifie
in his booke aforesaide among
other causes that he put. Lye in especial
writeth of three which were
chiefe beginning and roote of diuision
among them selues / prouing
by reason in those thre that it must
needes be that the felicitie and the
prosperitie of Rome must abate &
draw to decline. The which three,
firste hee saythe it was necessarye
that such aduersitie shoulde fall to
Rome. Secondarelye he saithe it
was consue
                  •
               udinarie. And thirdly
he saith it was voluntarie. Fyrst
that it was necessarye, hee proueth
by example of nature in this wyse:
That like as Phebus the sunne / 
when he ariseth in the Orient / and
by successiue course ascendeth into
the highest pointe of the Middaye

spere, and of his kinde and natural
course must discend and hathe his
golden tressed hornes in the westrē
wawes, and then dimmeth & darkneth
oure emysperie by ablence of
his lighte: And also eke when the
same golden wayne of Titan / fro
the Ariet is whirled vp to the hiest
tower of his ascencion in the celestian
signe of the Crabbe, and thā
by the mightie compelling of Natures
righte, he is constrayned to
discende downe and auale his charet:
Ryght so sembla
                  •
               lye there is
no worldlie worship so brighte nor
clere shyning in earthe / but that it
must encline & auale down as sone
as he hath attained to ye hiest & the
most famous point of his ascēcion.
For like as ye rage & the aboūdant
flow, whē it hath raught his sturdy
waues to ye hiest, sodēli foloweth an

                  〈◊〉
                & maketh hym to resort againe.
            
               In the same wyse whan any temporal
prosperitie is most flowinge in
felicitie / then is a sodein ebbe of aduersitie
most to be adrade. Also in
the same wise as ye may clerely discerne
& considre at the eye / in trees
and herbes / that when the vege
                  •
               atife
vertue by the comfortable influēce
of the sunne / is after the cold
winter: In Uerre by litle and lytle
ascended into braunches and
bowes, and causeth thē for to bud
and to blossome newe: and also in
herbes maketh a lustie and a fresh
colour newly to appere. And moreouer
by processe of tyme wyth her
holesome bawme aparaleth them,
with manifolde sondrye colour of
red / white, and grene, and than anon
after in discence of Apollo the
sunne, the same vertue fro the crop
aualeth again into ye roote. Right
so there is no felicitie so flouryng,

nor none so apparailed with blossomes
of transitorie riches, but as
soone as the shi
                  •
               ing Sunne of her
glory sheddeth his beames moste
clere, full vnwarelie ere they can
aduert or take hede / bene robbed
and reued of their Lordship / and
pio
                  •
               nged a downe by occasion of
some aduersitie, brought and induced
into aduersitie, either by sickenes
or by death. And thus that the
first cause is natural and necessary
and that all worldlye pompe and
pride shall passe, mine Auctor Lucan
hath proued by reason. Than
as touching the secōd cause which
is called customable and consuetudinarie,
ye may considre that euer
of custome it falleth that whan the
blinde goddesse of variaūce dame
Fortune hathe enhaunced a man
highest vpon her whele, wyth a sodein
sigh she plongeth hym downe

againe. Euident example ye maye
take of kinges and princes yt haue
bene tofore. And than touching the
third cause of destruccion of the citie / 
Lucan liketh to call it in his poetical
muses, voluntarie, which is
as much to saye, as a cause rooted
vpon wilfulnes without ani groūd
founded vpon reason. For onely of
wilfulnes they were so blinde: that
them list not to know them selues / 
but thought them selfes so assured
in their felicitie / that they mighte
not by no collateral occasion of aduersitie
be perturbed / ne put oute
thereof. And thus throughe false
surquedraunce they were made so
wilful, that none list to obey other.
And so was brought in obstinacie
euerich of them deming hym selfe
egall to other. And thus of contrarious
discorde among them selfes
onely of voluntari they stode disseuered

and deuided / which was one
of the chiefe occa
                  •
               ions of their destruction.
And for this 
                  •
               kyl toforne
declare
                  •
                / Lucan calleth the thyrde
cause voluntarie / in as much as it
was falselye founded vpon wyll.
And thus firste by a cause necessarie,
and by the seconde cause called
consuetudinarie, shewed tofore by
example of custome / and by thys
last third cause called voluntarie,
rooted onelye vpon will: the Romaines
among them selues stode
in such
                  •
                contrauersye, that they
doubted to which partie thei shuld
encline. And compendiouselye to

               e causes of diuision,
and howe the warre which of
Clarkes is called Bellum Ciuile:
which is as muche to saye in English
as a warre among thē selues.
For the clere cōpēdious proces of

platlye enformed of the malicious
conspiracie cōpassed and wrought
against him. Anon as he in his repayre
oute of Albion was passed
the bondes of Almaigne, and had
attained to the high Alpies / which
of 
                  •
               uctours bene called the colde
frosty hilles / & the bondes of Lombardie,
and so holding his passage
by the stood of the sturdy riuer called
of Lucan (Rubicauis) ther appeared
to him an old auncient Lady,
heauy and drery in a mantel of
blacke her face wympled tofore in
ful dolorous wise, the tresses of her
heade for age full hore and whyte.
And for constraint of her hartelye
wo: euen vpon the time whan the
blacke darke night had ouerspred

                  •
               e of
her vgly & her cloudye cope. This
wofull Lady tofore said, began her
lamentable complaynt to Iulius

in this wise: Oh ye noble worthy
knightes, most renoumed of fame / 
Alas, whether purpose ye with so
mightie apparail of Mars to procede
                  •
               
Or wher cast ye to fetch your
sturdye standerdes, or to displaye
your fearfull pinons and baners?
Oh alas / againste whom haue ye
cast finallye to execute the mortall
hate that brenneth in your hart, or
against whom purpose ye in suche
cruell wise to proue your myghte?
Remēbre in your thought yt ye be
vpholden by the Cenate of Rome,
and your self accompted as for noble
and ful worthie knights of the
the citie / and shewe not your selfe
nowe ennemyes to the Empire, by

               one. And oh alas aduer
                  •
               e & considre
in your hart the noble and the

prudent statutes of the pol

               cie of
Rome / the which ful plainlye doth
expresse that it is leful vnto no mā
for to passe the boundes of thys
streame, but if he be mortal and rebel
vnto Rome. Now ye therefore
that haue so long bene frends, and
so manlye mayntained the honour
of the Citie, withdrawe your foote
and haste not to faste, but let good
deliberacion restrain your reines,
that hasty wilfulness leade you not
to confusion / not onely of your self
but vnto the originall ruine of the
citie / by the aboundant sheding of
blood that is likely to ensue. And
sodenly when this Lady had briefly
expressed the som of her sentēce,
without more she disapered. This
manly man and fortunate knight

and true. Wherefore ye mighty
and noble Senatours of Rome
I require you of right that ye nothing

that I come with strong & mighty

that I come to you of full purpose

deserued be not denied me: I am
and euer will be for life or death, a
true knight to the citie to my liues

like a Lyon not dismayed nor
afraid / first of al in his own person
he passed the Riuer, the which Riuer
like as Lucan remēbreth / the
same time at the comming of Cezar / 
against his customable course
was reysed on heighte into a great
floode, and all the white snowes of
Alpies wer resolued with the beames

                  •
                through the

aduentures afraid / but like a manly
man ful wel assured in himselfe

in the presence of all his woorthye
knightes said in this maner: Here
I leaue behinde, all the old confederacies
made betwixt Rome and
me / and here I leaue al the frendship
of old antiquitie / and onely folow
the traces of Fortune / and of
whole entent begynne a ryghtfull

               ie, a Citie partinent to

                  •
               
on of the Empire / none so hardi to
resist nor to withstād the furi of his
sword / & al this while ye Romaines
stāding in dout to which party thei

should encline / whether to Cezar / 
or to Pompey. For of charity that
they had to their wiues & their childrē,
& to the old statutes of the city
thei were fauourable to Pompey / 
& of dread that they had of Cezars
sword, thei stode in 
                  •
               o great ambiguicie,
yt thei could not deme what
was best to do. Lo how the mortal
enui of twain was cause & occasion
yt that noble citie which had all the
world in subiectiō, & was called lady
& Empresse of al Regions was
brought into destruction. For in
these twoo first began the diuision
which neuer after might parfitlie
be restored nor recōsiled to vnity,
wherbi as semeth vnto mē yt al prudent
princes which haue the gouernaunce
in Prouinces and regions
shuld take exāple what harme & damage
it is, & how final a destructiō
it is to be deuided amōg thē selfes

And for to ratifie by more Autentike
example how much that vnity
more auaileth then diuision, I wil
shortelye rehearce an example, the
whiche Ualerie putte
                  •
               h / and it is
this. This auctour reherceth that
whilom whan the Citye of Rome
stoode likely to haue b
                  •
               ne deuided
of a debate that was newly begon
among them selues. There was a
wyse Philosopher amonge theym,
which of high discressiō con
                  •
               idered
the great perill that was likelye to

                  •
               al and folow, & thought he would
of wisdom voyd that might ensue.
And in presence of all the Cenate
and Lordes of the Citie / he made
bring foorth an horsse which had a
long and a thicke tayle growen behinde / 
and than he commaunded
the mightiest chāpion of the towne
to set on both his hands, and assay
if he might by force pul of the hors

taile at a plu
                  •
               ke. And all 
                  •
               e it that
he plucked to the vttermost of hys
mighte / it woulde not auaile. And
than anon this Philosopher made
call to the presence of the Cenate / 
the most impotent man of the citie,
a man vnweldye and crooked of
age. And thys Philosopher made
this old man to pluck the one hereafter
an other of the hors taile, tyll
by litle and litle by proces the tayl
was wasted cleane awaye, and the
hors naked and bare behinde. Beholde
sayde the Philosopher, that
while the tail of the hors was hole
and one in it selfe, and eue
                  •
               ich here
with other (vndeuided) the mightiest
champion of your city might do
thereto no damage. But as soone
as euery here was deuided and disseuered
fro other, he that was lest
of power among ye all / lefte neuer
tyll the tayle was consumed and

brought to nought. By whiche example
said the Philosopher, prudently
aduert & wisely cast tofore,
that as longe as ye be one in your
selues / & of one hart / there is none
so strong nor so mightie that may
auail by force to attempt your worthines.
But as sone as amōg your
selues one is deuided from an other,
your enemies, though they be
ful impotent of power / they shal bi
process
                  •
                of tyme plucke awaye the
most fairest and the most shene fethers
of your worthines. And by
this example the Philosopher toforesaid
reconciled the Romaines
againe to vnitie, & voided away dit
uision amōg thē selues. Now compendiously
to resorte againe to my
matter like as the stori maketh mē
               cion / 
the Romaines standynge in
great contrauersie among thē selues
to which partye they shoulde

draw, the Gods by many signes &
pronosticacions declared vnto thē
the great mischiefe that was lykelye
and verie semblable to folowe.
For there appeared vnto them many
vncouth ymages of stars / some
in brenning haberions of fire, and
some with bright brondes in theyr
handes casting flame enuiron / and
some with firie dartes & sharpe hoked
arowes shootinge in the ayre.
And in especiall there appeared a
large Comete of stremes ye whiche
raught their braunches on ye foure
plages of the firmament. And the
sun also whē he shone most bright
in the meridional plage, the dai vnwarelie
turned to nyghte. And the
pale moone againste the common
course of her kynde: sodeynlye shee
was clypsed of her lyght. And further
the dreadfull karibeis of the
sea Cicile was turned into blood.

Al the Houndes also beinge in the
bondes 
                  •
               f Rome, lefte the noy
                  •
               e of
their barking / and in signe of pronosticaciō
of great sorow that was
to come, they howled and we imented
that it was pitie to heare / and
the supersticious fire whiche continuallie
tofore was wont to burne
in the chaste temple of the Goddes
called Uesta, the flame of the same
fire euer being bright vpon her auters.
Of the which fire by old time
was prophecied / that as sone as it
deuided and departed at wain (as
it did then) that the feastes and the
solempnities of Rome shuld cease.
And like as the smokes of the funeral
fyre of the Theban brethren departed
at Thebes: right so the departing
of fire vpon their aulters,
was a true signe and a pronostike
of diuision that should fal amonge
them, finally to declare to euery region

tha
                  •
                where as the fire of loue
and parfite charity stand departed
and deuided amonge them selues / 
it is a very e
                  •
               idence that withoute
remedie it draweth to his destruccion.

                  •
               ould folow / 
the foming wawes of the sea
surmounted the height of Athlantis
hylles. Also al the rich ymages
in the Temples of Rome: whyche
were made of gold / syluer, and dyuers
other sundrye metalles: so as
they stoode in their rich and costly
tabernac
                  •

               ke
time of diuision wofully complayning
and weping / so farforthe that
the teares of their eyen distylled a
downe into the earthe, so complayning
the desolacion of their Citye / 
onelye caused by occasion of theyr
contageous diuision among them
selues. Byrdes also against the custome

of their nature, were secne
fleing vpon nightes. And beastes
also were hearde speakinge, and
women brought foorth monstrous
children. And all these vncouthe
wonders befell but a lytle tofore
the foresaide diuision in the noble
Citie of Rome / for the dreadfull
tyme aproched full neare / of the
which Cibyll so long had prophecied
afore, when she sent the shorte
summe of her sentence to the Cenatours
of Rome compendiouslye
in the nombre of .vi. letters. Thre
R. R. R. and three F. F. F. whyche
wer fully the pronosticacion of .vi.
mischiefes that should of necessitie
fal vnto the citie of Rome, comprehended
and included in the .vi. letters
specified in this wyse / Regna
Rome Ruent, Fero Flamme Fame,
The Region of Rome bi thre thinges
shall drawe to ruine: Firste by

the sword of warre amonge them
selues / and next by fyre, and than
by hunger. The whiche three myschiefes
so contagiouslie shal assail
the citie: that it shalbe very vnportable
vnto them / and the grounde
and roote of al this confusion shal
be among them selues discord and
diuision. Furthermore to declare
sondry pronosticacions that fell in
their citie whan the Priests made
sacrifice to their Gods: their fires
sodeinly quenched. In the graues
and sepulchres of dead men, there
were heard woful and lamentable
noyses and 
                  •
               owndes whych dydde
put the people in very great dread
And in thys wise the mischiefe and
the ruyne was shewed and declared:
Fyrste by dyuers figures and
sondrye likenesses of starres shewed
in the heauen, and next by wonderfull
Monsters in the earthe.

Also the birdes and the foules of
the ayre come homelye and not afraide
fleinge into the Citie / by the
which signe their Clarkes that be
called Augures, expounden it to
their confusion. And they by many
fold mo signes than I maye or can
declare, the subuersion of the Citie
ful long was shewed toforne, onely
begon by this contageous diuisiō.
But shortelye to entreate the substaunce
of the storie, whan that Iulius
wyth strong hande approched
the bonds of Rome: after whan he
had wonne the citie of Arimy: and
had also conquered Rauenne: and
Pompey for feare was fledde toward
the parties of Grece to make
himself strong: Thei of Rome had
shortly determined in sētence that
Iulius not enter the Citye, but so
were that his whole retinue were
left behinde. But when they knew

and saw him so passingly mightye
and strong: they began to quaken
in theyr hartes, and namely: when
they were destitute of an head. Of
which and for that, some Dukes of
Pompey drew them to the parties
of Italy into a city which whylom
was called Dirachium. And euer
thys woorthy knight Iulius wyth
his chiualry pursued after, and all
that wythstoode he slewe / and the
remnaunt he put manly to flyght.
And day by day the power of Iulius
gan multiplye and encrease / 
and mauger al his enemies of very
force he entred the citye. And as
some auctours write / whan the Romaines
(for dread) were readye to
receiue him by theyr gates: he of
indignacion and disdayne / made
breake the walles, and proudly entred
as a Conquerour, and iustified
the Romaynes as his, and wholy

tooke on hym the gouernaunce / 
not onely of the citie / but of all the
whole Empyre. And maugre the
Cenate he brake the brason doore
of their treasure, and by violence
toke and 
                  •
               aught it away, and plenteouslye
departed it amonge hys
knights. And in this meane while
ful many kinges of the East party
of the worlde, came and assembled
before the foresaid city called Dirachium.
Of entent to sustaine the
party of Pompey against Iulius.
And as soone as there was made
relacion to Iulius Cezar of thys
great assemble: he made no delay / 
but with all his power passed by a
countrey which of mine authour is
called Epirum, and so he entred in
to the costes of Thessalie / wher as
he founde Pompey / batayled againste
hym wyth foure score Cohortes
and eight, departed into .iii

wardes. Now to declare the nombre
& the multitude of a cohort: ye
shal vnderstand that there be two
maner of Cohortes, the more, & the
lesse. And the more by discripcion
of Auctours, conteineth fiue hundred,
and the lesse foure hundred.
There were also on the partye of
Pompey, fortie thousande of foote
men / and in the left wing ther wer
beside al this, sixe hūdred knighes
on horsebacke. And in the ryghte
wyng ther wer .v. C. among which
as Unicent in his mirrour historiall
maketh minde there were many
kynges and princes / and many
other woorthye Cenatoures and
knightes of Rome which came in
defēce of Pompey. And as it is remembred
also / Cesar had .lxxx. Cohortes,
deuided & departed in thre
wardes. And with this he hadde
xxx. M. of footemen, wtout passing

great nomber of knightes on hors
backe. And in this mortal battail / 
al the party of Pompey wer 
                  •
               ut to
flight, and there were slaine on his
syde .xii. M. and of worthy 
                  •
               eders
which be called Centurians, were
slayne .xxxiii. And Pompey fledde
out of the field, and for refuge toke
a shyp and passed by the bondes of
A
                  •
               ie through Thyrye / and aryued
in Egipt. And there anone at hys
aryual by the commaundement of
Tholome kynge of Egipt, he was
beheaded onely for loue & fauoure
of Iulius. And fro this victorye
thys foresaid Iulius hasted to the
parties of Syrye / toward ye mightie
City of A
                  •
               yzaundre. And there
T
                  •
               olome king of Alizaundre held
a battail with Iulius Cezar, both
on lande and on water. In whyche
warre were slayne .xxii. M. in the
fielde / and .xii, hundred ships dyscom
                  •
               ited

and drowned. And Tholome
the kinge / as he woulde haue
fled out of a ship (for haste) he fel in
to the sea and was drowned. And
as his bodye was cast to lande / he
was knowen and discouered by a
gile haberion, the which haberion
Iulius Cezar made to be sent vnto
the citie of Alizandre / for dread
of which they of Alizandre yelded
the citie vnto him. Than he repayred
againe into Egipt / and by occasion
of the death of Tholome he
gaue the Septer and the Realme
and the whole gouernaunce of Egipt
vnto the Queene Cleopatra.
And so after the conquest of manye
other Prouincies, Regions / and
landes, he made his repaire again
the seconde time vnto the Citye of
Rome / and there he did take vpon
him two offices, both of Consull &
of Dictatour. And from thence he

went vnto the conquest of Affcike
and there began a new warre, in especial
against al the aliaunce and
the blood of Pompey, and slew all
the Dukes that were enclined to
be fauourable to the partie of Pō
               pey,
among which were slaine thre
mightie princes, Faustus / Cilla / &
Postumus, & Pompeia, the doughter
of Pompey iudged to be dead.
And from those parties he entred
with a mightie and strong hand in
to Spayne / and there (so as Suetonins
writeth) he tooke vpon him
power to receiue the tribute, which
on the partie of Spayne was due
vnto Rome. And so as thys storye
maketh mencion / he proceeded so
far
                  •
               e in his conquest, so yt he came
to the pillers of Gad
                  •
               s, and there
he entered into the Temple of the
stronge mightie champion called
Hercu
                  •
               es. And whan he beheld in

the same Temple a riche image of
gold / set vp for a memorie of kyng
Alizaundre: anon this Cezar gan
to sigh and complayne in his selfe
that he neuer might attayne in his
conquest to deserue so victorious
a Palme of worthines as in theyr
tyme dyd Alisaunder and Hercules.
And thus pensible and heauye
(he issuing oute of the Temple of
Hercules) fullye purposed hym in
his courage, knightly to take vpō
him of manly courage, some newe
enterprises of hygh prowesse. And
whiles that he was thus surprised
in his best thought / the next night
ensuynge, he ha
                  •
               de a wonderfull
vision / whych was thys: It seemed
vnto hym in hys sleepe / that
he meddled wyth hys owne Mother:
Of the whyche dreame hee
full greatly afrayde / and horribly
agrised / made call to his presence,

his wise Philo
                  •
               ophers and Diuinours / 
to geue a plaine and a clere
interpretacion vpon hys dreame.
And they anon concluded in shorte
sentence, yt it was an euident signe
that he should be fully put in pos

to haue the imperiall dominacion
ouer al the world. For these
prudent Philosophers vnderstode
nothing by the fleshly coniunction
that he had with his mother / but a
knot of Aliaunce, perfourmed vp
betwene the earth and him. Understandyng
in their exposicion / that
the earth is primordinall mother
of al thing / concluding therby that
he should attaine to be Lorde and
Emperour ouer all the parties of
the earth. And thus in al hast after
the mighty conquest of Affrike / he
repaired the third time to Rome,
and was made Emperour ouer al
the world / and was so farforth enhaunced

on height, that the sunne
of his worthines was

vpon his spere, that it attayned to
the highest pricke of his exaltacion,
so that of necessitie he must discend.
For as the story maketh mencion / 
he perseuered not in his Empire
fully the space of fiue yeare.
And for to rehearce compendiously
the prodigies and the wonderful
signes yt befell afore his death.
It is remēbred that the same yere
of Iulius death, in the yle of Capwey:
there was found by Quarreours
of the country a rich Tombe
of stone, and therein was founde a
litle tablet of golde, grauen wyth
letters of Greeke / sayinge in thys
wise: When euer it shal befall that
the Tombe of Capis shall be opened,
and that his bones shalbe vnclosed:
that same yeare shal the noble
& worthy Conquerour Iulius

Cezar be murdred in the Capitole
at Rome by the false conspiracye
and ymaginacion of theym that he
hathe trust

               d moste. Nowe was
thys foresayde Capis a worthye
man and o
                  •
                great Aucthoritie, and
the first Founder and beginner of
the Countrey of Capwey / and named
after him. And like as the letters
in Greeke specified / it befell.
And the seconde prodigye that befel
tofore the deathe of Cezar was
thys: Upon the same nighte tofore
that he was slayne on the morowe,
thys noble Conqueroure Iulius
had a reuelacion / seemynge vnto
him in his sleepe, that he was winged
lyke an Eagle, and howe hee
tooke hys flyght so hygh, that he
sored aboue the skyes, and approched
to ye celestiall see of Iupiter / 
And fell downe vppon the ryghte
hande of hys God. An other marueilous

signe or prodigy there fel.
Also his Wife named Caliphurna
a lytle tofore the death of her Lord
Iulius, had a wonderful dreame

Also as Unicent in hys hystoriall
bookes maketh mencion, an hundred
dayes before hys pyteous
murder in the large Market place
of Rome / where as the stature and
the great ymage of Cezar stoode / 

vppon an highe piller of stone / the
name of Cezar grauē with letters
of gold aboue his head, when the

                  •
               mper ayre was
most clere and styl, with a sodayne
stroke of the firie leuen / the fyrste
letter of his name .C. was smyten
away. Declaring by this pronostical
signe, that like as this letter C
in nombre betokeneth an hundred / 
& was also most craftely wrought
and grauen as for the chief capital
letter of his name, to shew openly
that the rasing away of this letter
by violence of the firye leuen: that
he that was head of all the earthe,
within the space of a hūdred daies
next ensuing, should be vengeabli
murdred in Rome. Also the same
day of his murdre as he went most
royally in his Imperiall araye toward
the Consistorie, a poore man
named Tong
                  •
               lius tooke him letters

of all the purposed conspiracy
by the Cenate vpon his death / but
for hee was negligent to reade the
letters, and to vnclose them, the vē
               geable
murder was execute vpon
hym. By which example let no mā
be slow nor negligent to reade his
letters, lest after for his negligēce
it may turne him to great damage
which after may not lightly be recouered.
And the chiefe cause and
worker of this murder / was Brutus
Crassus / associed vnto him .ii.
hundred and syxty of the Cenate,
al hauing bodkins in theyr sleues.
And as it is in storye remembred,
he had .xxiiii. deadly woundes as
he sat in the Capitole, and as saith
mine aucthour / he neuer in all hys
smarte / made neyther crye nor no
noyse / except onelye a lamentable
and a dolorous sigh, like a mā that
with sodaine sorowe were afrayde.

So that touchinge the vengeable
maner of hys pyteous murder I
maye conclude with him that was
Floure of Poetes in our Englishe
tounge / and the first that euer enlumined
our lāguage with floures
of Rethorique and Eloquence, I
meane my maister Chaucer, which
compendiouslie wrote the death of
this mightie Emperour, saying in
this wise, as foloweth hereafter in
these lines of metre.

prudent maister tofore said: the fro
warde and the contrarious Ladye
Dame Fortune, spareth neyther
Emperour nor king to plunge him
downe sodenly fro the highest prik

of her vnstable wheele. Alas that
neuer man lyft to lift vp his harts
eye / and prudentlye to aduerte the
mutabilitie and the sodain chaūge
of this false world. And let ye wyse
gouernours of euery lande and region
make a mirror in theyr minde
of this manly man Iulius, & consider
in their hartes the contagious
damages, and the importable harmes
of diuision, and let them se aduisedly,
and take example how the
ambicous pride of Iulius, the fretinge
enuie of Pompeyus, and the
vnstaunchable gredye couetise of
Marcus Crassus, were chiefe and
primordial cause of their destruccion,
executed & accomplished by cruel
death. And not onelye that these
aforesaide three abhominable vyces
were cause of their owne death
onely, but occasiō of many a thousand
other, many more thē I cā tel

Thus the City of Rome not onely
made bare and barein of their old
riches, & spoyled of their treasoure
on the tone syde, but destitute and
desolate by death of their knyghthoode
on the other side / me semeth
ought inough suffice to exemplifie
what is to begin a warre / and specially
to considre the irrecuperable
harmes of diuision. And for thys
skyl most especially by commaundement
of my maister / I tooke vpon
me this litle translacion, and after
my litle cunning, haue put it in
remembraunce.
