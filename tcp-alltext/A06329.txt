                  Psalm. 129.
            
            This daye whiche we do solempnyse and kepe holy in remēbraunce of the tēdre, paynfull, and most gloryous passyon of our sauiour Iesu Christe, is called the good frydaye. And not wt
               out a cause. For as vpon this daye, god dyde somoche good for vs, that more good cowd not be done. For as vpon this day, Christe the sone of god, suffrede for vs, he suffrede passyon & deathe, deathe of the crosse: the moost pāguyouse, paynfull and cruell deathe that euer was suffrede. By whiche passion and deathe, he redemed the world: by whiche passion & deathe, moost hyghely he pleased god the fadre, whiche was frome the fall of Adam vnto the tyme of this passion, vtterly displeased with man: by whiche passion and deathe, he reconcyled man to god, & brought hym ayen into fauour, & restored hym to grace. And why dyd god the fadre suffre this his sone,Loue caused the fadre to sende hys sone to dye for vs. E
                        •
                     he. 2. vndre this maner to dye? Surely for loue, for loue that he bare vnto vs, loue was the cause, loue caused hym so to doo. Propter nimiam charitatē
                (saythe thapostle) qua dilexit nos deus, cū essemus mortui peccatis, cōuiuificauit nos CHRISTO. For that grette excedynge charytie and loue yt the fadre of heuen loued vs with all, where we were synners and deade in synne: he dyd quyckē
               
and reuiue vs ayē by his sone Christe. Loo here maye you se the cause why god dyde this grette good vnto vs. The apostle saythe, it was for his grette abundant charytie, for his maruelous excedynge loue: not for our merytes, not for our desertes, but for loue. What loue? For the loue he bare to hym selfe? Nay, nay. It was for the inestymable loue he bare vnto vs,

                  Propter nimiā (inquit) charitatem qua dilexit nos.
                What dyde he by this loue? 
                  Conuiuificauit nos CHRISTO.
                He reuyued vs ayen in Christe, scorne deathe to life.
Howe? Christo. In Christe and by Christe. Christ was the doer, in Christe his passiō, in Christe his bloode, whose vertue remayneth in the sacrament of baptisme, were we purged, clensed, and made holle: not frome oon, twoo, thre, or foure synnes: but 
                  ab oībus iniquitatibus nostris.
                Frome all our synnes, he reuyued vs by this passion, not onely frome synne, but also frome the deathe yt was due for synne, frome deathe eternall.
            And howe dyde the fadre warke this redempcyō? In Christo. In Christe, and by Christe. Howe by Christe?
                  Roma. 8.
               
                  Proprio filio suo non pepercit
                (saythe  thapostle) 
                  sed pro omnibus nobis tradidit illū. Quomodo nō etiam cum illo omnia nobis donauit? This was ye maner howe he wrought our redempciō, he spared not his own propre sone whiche was and is consubstanciall and coeternall with him, of on substaunce with the fader, of on beinge, of on power, of on knowledge: on with hym in substaunce,

on in beinge, on in power, on in knowledge: in all thynges oon with the fadre.
Thus his onely sone he spared not: but wold he shulde be borne of a virgyne and become mortall, and to suffre deathe for vs. And that is it that thapostle saythe, Pro omnibus nobis tradidit illū. He gaue hym for the and for me, & for this man and for that man. For any moo? Ye Pro omnibus nobis. For vs all: for all man kynde. And he saythe, Tradidit. He dyde traade and gyue hym. This tradere, is more than dare. For dare, is to gyue, but Tradere, is dare in potestatem. Tradere is to gyue in to a mannes power, to vse the thynge yt is gyuē at his or theyr own pleasures to whome it is giuen, to do with it euen what they wyll: as ye wyll saye, to make or marre, to vse at libertie. And so dyde the fadre of heuen for our sake, he gaue hys sone Christe into the handes & power of the Iewes, to vse hym and do with him what they wolde: to handle: to treate, to haale, to lugge, to beate, to scourdge, to cutte, to mangle, to crucifye, and cruelly to putto deathe. And so for this cause Tradidit illum. He put hym holly into theyr handes for our saluacyon, to do with him what they wold, and so they dyde.
            And he yt gaue vs so greate a treasure,The fadre gaue vs wt his sone all goodnes. his own sone, which is his treasure, his wisedōe, his sapiē
               ce, his power: whiche is ye glorye of heuē, in whōe angellꝭ dothe glorye, in whome angellꝭ desyreth to beholde, in whose vysage stādeth ye glorye of

heuen, the felicitye and fruicion ther: he that giueth vs so grette a gyfte, his owne sone, wyll not sticke to giue vs smaller gyftes with this great gyfte, he wyll not stycke to giue vs all gud thynges with hys sone. For he dyde giue to vs wt hym, muche goodenes, muche profyte, muche comforte. He gaue to vs with hym the gyfte of faythe, ye gyftes of hope, charitye, paciēcye, tēperancye, peace, lōganimitye, goodnes, benignitie, meknes, tēperancy, prudence, wysedome, chastitie, obedience, modestie, contynency, strenghe of soule, good wyll, promptitude and redines, a ply aunt good wyll to liue well. He gaue with hym Dona spiritus, gyftes of the holy gooste. To thys man the gyfte of vnderstandynge, to that man the gyfte of wysedome, to this man the gyfte of pitye, to that man the gyfte of feare towardes god, fortitude and strenghe of soule to labour in god, to resiste synne, to do good deades. He gaue vs with this grette gyfte, grace: grace to be cō
               trite and repentaunt for our synnes, grace to do penaunce, grace to morne, wepe, and lamēte our wycked liues. He giueth vs with his sone, remission of our synnes. And wyll giue vs ye glorye of heuen with hym selfe, if we wyll liue accordingly and lyke vnto Christianes.Loue caused the sone to dye for man.
            
            And the fadre dyde not this onely of his highe charitye, thus giue his deere darlynge, his sone for vs: but his mercyfull sone also dyde giue him

selffe for vs. Thapostle saythe. Qui dilexit me,
               
                  Galat. 2. 
               tradidit seipsum pro me. He that loued me, dyde giue him selfe for me. But why dyde he soo? what hadde we done for him, that he shuld so do to vs? was it of our desertes? hadde we deserued that he shuld so do? Nay. We were wretched synners, we were myserable lyuers, the enemyes to god, and out of fauour: and yet he gaue himselffe into the handes of hys enemyes for vs. But why dyde he so? Certaynely for loue. Dilexit me, sayth thapostle. He loued me. Loue was the cause, loue moued and styrred hym to giue hym selffe to the deathe for vs. What loue? The loue whiche I spake of a fore, the loue that he bare to the, to me, and to all mankynde. What gaue he for the? Money? gold? precyouse stones? landes? or goodes? Nay. He gaue a more precyouse gyfte than so. Tradidit scipsum. He gaue hym selffe. Hym selfe, hys body. And not onely hys bodye, but also hys soule, hys liffe, hys deathe, and hys godhede. He gaue hys bodye for the to the Iewes, to hā
               dle, to treate, to beate, to scourge, to turmoyle, to kyll, to slee, to crucifye, to do with it what they wolde: and so dyde they, euen to theyr own dampnacyō, he gaue so hys bodye in to theyr handes to redeme and byethe. He gaue for vs also his bodye beinge a liue to the crosse, beinge deade to the sepulture, that thy bodye beinge a liue, mought liue cleane: & beinge deade, mought

and shuld rest in the sepulture, and at that daye of god to ryse ayen, to be gloryfyed and raigne with hym in glory. He giueth to the ayē this his moost precyous bodye nowe rysen frome deathe to liffe, in that moost holy sacrament of the Euchariste, the sacrament of the aultre. He giueth hym selffe vnto vs, bothe bodye and blood: soule, and godhede, nowe raignynge in glory and syttynge on the ryght hande of his fadre,

He dayly dothe shewe to god the fadre, his manhode whiche he toke vpon hym, & the greuouse maner of his deathe and passion whiche he suffrede for vs: so to moue the fadre to mercy & pytie, so to procure mercy for man: whose peticyon cannot be contempned but gracyously harde.

As who saye, that mercy, that pitie and compassion that thou shewest to man in this doynge, shewe now vnto hym in his myserie of synne, haue compassion on hym, shewe thyn olde mercy, graunte thou him his iuste peticiō and humble suyte, remytte hys synne, giue hym grace, take hym to thy fauour.
            In like maner dothe god ye sone shewe to ye fadre his wounde in his syde, & hys other woundes, to moue hym to like mercy:
whiche was so mercyfull to sende downe hys sone, to suffre these woundes and deathe for man.

for vs.1. Ioan. 1.
Ayen saynt Iohā saythe.
Si quis peccauerit, aduocatū habemus apud patrem, Iesum Christūiustū, & ipse est propiciatio pro peccatis nostris: nō pro nostris tantū, sed etiā pro peccatis totius mūdi.
If any man by frayltie dothe offende and synne let hym not despayre, for he hathe an aduocate in heuen afore the fadre, his sone Iesus Christe. Aduocatum iustum, a iuste aduocate. For he prayeth, not for euery synner that wyll crye and call and neuer ryse frome synne: but for veraye true penytentes, for them that are displeased with them selues and with theyr synne: lett thē crye, lett them call, and anone he callythe with them, and makyth peticyō for thē: anone he heareth, he helpeth, and he then intercedeth to the fadre for them. Iustum, a iuste aduocate, he promoteth none euyll causes. Iustum. He taketh no rewardes, no gyftes, no brybes. He dothe not accepte any personage but after hys liuynge. He regardeth not bloode nor byrth, kythe nor kyne, strengthe nor wisedome, beawtie nor fayrenes, ryches nor pouertie. He regardeth onely the Christiane and vertuouse liffe of man. And after hys deedes he dothe accepte or repell. Iustum. He is a iuste aduocate.
            
               Thre tymes Christe prayd for vs. Ioan. 17.And thre tymes I reade that he dyde shewe hym selffe a vocate, a peticioner for vs. Ones before his passion, whenne he sayth to the fadre.
Ego pro eis rogo, non pro mundo, sed pro his quos

dedisti mihi, quia tui sunt.
I pray for them and not for the worlde, I praye for those that thou haste gyuen me, for they be thyn.
Secondaryly in  hys passion, whenne he sayde, 
                  Pater ignosce illis,
                  
                     Luc. 23.

Fadre forgyue them, they wote not what they doo. Thyrdely after  hys passion as here, Aduocatum habemus, & caetera. The fyrst intercession was by worde. The soconde was by effusion of his bloode. The thyrde is by his dayly shewynge to the fadre his woundes, so to moue hym to mercy and pytie, to haue compassion on the worlde.
            
               Of this grette and infinite charytie writeth the apostle Paule in an othec place sainge.

What moued Christe to dye for wycked synners? Scante we shall fynde one that wyll dye for a iuste man.Noo mā wyll dye for an other, not for hys frynde. And where shall we fynde hym that dare dye for a good man? Our lorde god hathe shewed a commendable and laudable charytie towardes vs, for where that we were synners, wretched lyuers, abhomynable in the syght of god: Christe dyed for vs. In whose bloode, we be iustifyed and made rightuouse: in whose bloode,

we shalbe saued frome the yre & wrathe of god. Lyue thou neuer so well, liue thou neuer so holyly, let se if thou were in the case nowe to dye, vnles thou shuldest gett one that wolde dye for the, where shuldest thou haue one? where shuldest thou fynde hym that wold doo so muche for the, by whose death thou shuldest escape death? Nowe thou beinge a synner, a mysseliuer, lett see who will dye for the? Any one? Not the fadre for the sone,Christ dyed for his enemys. not the sone for the fadre. Yet thou beinge a synner, an ennemye to god: he dyed for the. Frely, without queste. Frely, not hyred, not requyred, but of his owne, mere, mercyfull goodenes offrede hym selffe thereunto, onely for the loue he bare vnto the. And that is it the apostle saythe.

                  Commendat deus charitatem suam in nobis, quoniam cum adhuc peccatores essemus, & caetera.
                He shewed a meruelouse laudable charytie to vs, in that we beinge horryble synners, yee before we were renate or borne the chyldren of god by baptisme, before we were iustifyed by faythe, ye before that we were borne or knowē to the worlde, Mortuus est pro nobis, he dyet for vs, not requyred, not desyored, not hyred thereunto:

                He shall redeme Israel frome all his iniquyties, He shall redeme Israel frome all his iniquyties. Not frome a patche or a pece, not frome one, two, thre or four iniquyties, but frome all. Frome all ther iniquyties, frome all ther synnes, frome oryginall and actuall, frome veniall and deathly, frome all. And whenne the prophete wrote these wordes, this passiō was to come, and therfore sayd Redimet, he shall redeme. And nowe it is paste, and true ꝙ redemit. He hathe verily suffrede passion and deathe, and hathe redemed Israel frome all hys imiquyties, frome all hys synnes.

Thou haste good lorde opened and shewed▪ thy power, thy vertue, thy wysedome vnto the worlde. What is this vertue, power and wysedome of God?
The apostle shewed to the Corynthes,1. Cor. 1. where he callithe

                He calleth Christe incarnate, ye vertue and wysedome of god the fadre.
He is called the vertue and power of the fadre, the wysedome of the fadre: for by hym, the fadre maade the worlde of nothynge, by hym he gouerneth ye worlde, by hym he protecteth, contynueth, and holdeth vppe the worlde, by hym he punyshethe ye worlde: in some place one punyshemēt, in some place an other.

This and all other thynges, dothe the fadre warke by hys sone Iesus Christe, whiche is called hys uertue, hys power, and hys wysedome.

This vertue the sone of god,God was knowē to the world or he cāe to ye prophetꝭ, but not to all. was knowen to the worlde many thousande yeres afore he came. For the prophetes almost at the begynnynge of all, wrote that he shulde come in to the worlde, and that he shulde be borne of a virgyne, and yt he shulde rebuke the worlde for theyr synne, and teache truthe, and warke myracles, make holle the lame and sicke, clense lepres, giue syght to ye blinde, raysse to life deade bodyes, remytte synne, redeme man: with muche more as is open in the bookes of the prophetes and in the psalmes.

synne? I oughte to be washed of the and thou comest to be washed of me?
O Lorde god what meaneth this? Christe answerede. ,

For vndre this maner, it besemeth vs to fulfyll all iustice, all iustice id est omnē humilitatē, al humylite. Here christe taughtt all ye worlde humblye to submytte them selues, vnto the sacramentes of hys churche, what degree so euer they be of: ye and to fulfyll all vertue to him belōgyng.
For this iustice cōteyneth in him selfe all vertue, as saythe saynt Ambrose. 
                  Vbi iusticia, ibi cunctarum uirtutum concordia.

Where iustice is, ther is an vnitie, a concorde, a gadrynge to gether of all vertues. And so dyde Iohan obey hys maysters wyll, and baptyzed hym. And then dyde the fadre of heuen open and manyfeste hys sone Christe to the worlde. Not onely by the warkes of Christe, but also by testymonye of his owne worde. For whēne Christe was thus baptized, and wente oute of the water,

                  . the heuens opened, the holye goost descended in a corporall likenes of a doue, and stude vpon him.
The fadre spake frome heuen wt a lowde voyce, saynge. 
                  Hic est filius meus dilectus, in quo mihi cō
                     placui.
                And Mathewe wrytynge of hys transfiguracyon, added more and seyde,

               Filius meus dilectus, myne owne beloued sone in whome I delyte, here hym. He shall teache the worlde, he shall preache truthe, Ipsum audite, here hym. He shall proue hym selffe to be veray god, he shall proue by hys warkes, to be the veraye prophete that shall saue ye worlde. He shall redeme man, he shall remytte synne, he shall send downe the holy gooste, he shall iudge ye worlde: Ipsum audite, here hym, folowe hym, obey hys worde, kepe hys commaūdementes, folowe that he byddeth you folowe, doo that he byddeth you doo, he is my sone, Ipsum audite, here hym. What more testimonye nede we to haue of Christe to proue hym to be the sauiour of the worlde then this? then the testimonye of the fadre? the testimonye of the holy goost, hys owne warkes & wonders? Here was open wytenes, here was proue enoughe, to proue that he was the sone of god. And yet he was as Esay dothe say, ye hydde god, vnknowen to the worlde. 
                  Vere tu es deus absconditus,

               inquit.
Thou arte the hydde god, hydde vnto the worlde not knowen to man, the world yet wold not knowe hym.
            For as it is open in Mathewe, After that Christe was baptized and wēte into wyldernes, ther ouercomynge the grette enemye of man ye deuyll by that ayen prouynge hym selffe to be god: and after wente abrode all Iudee, declarynge

hym selffe aswell by hys lyuynge, his preachynge, as by myracles doynge, to be veraye god, as Nichodemus sayde vnto hym,
                  Ioan. 5.
               
                  Nemo potest haec signa facere quae tu facis, nisi fuerit deus cū eo.
                None maye do these signes yt thou doeste vnles god were with hym. And yet he was Deus absconditus mundo. He was god, and hydde to the worlde, not knowē.
Yet to make hym more manyfeste and knowen to the worlde, he asked hys disciples, Quem dicūt homines esse filium hominis? What dothe ye world saye of Christe?
                  Math. 16 whōe dothe they call hym? They answered, Some dothe call the Iohan baptiste, some calleth the Helyas, some Heremye or one of the ꝓphetes. Christe sayde, whome do you call me? Symon Petre answered. Tu es Christus filius dei uiui.
               Peter did witnes Christe to be God. Thou art Christe the sone of the liuynge god. Loo, here was an other testimonye & witnes that he was god.
            Ayen it was prouyd that he was god, in his transfiguracion in the mount of Thabor: whenne he shewed hym selfe gloryous betwene Moses and Helyas, to Petre, Iames, and Iohā: they herynge the fadre frome heuen raynge as afore, 
                  Hic est filius meus dilectus, & caetera.
               
Where Petre desyored euer to dwell ther, thinkynge he had ben in heuen and sayde. Domine bonum est nos hic esse: faciamus tria tabernacula: tibi unū, Mosi unum, & Heliae unum.
Petre sawe suche a glory,

yt he desyred to a bydde there & neuer to returne ayen vnto ye worlde.
                  Christe witnessyd of hym self, to be God, by his workꝭ Ioan. 5. Christe many ways she wyd hym to be god cheffly in his passiō resurrection & ascencion. Virtꝰ dei. Christ is callid the power of God, the wisdom, the arme & ye right hād. Brachium dei.
                  
                  The arme of god
                And christe in an other place wytnessed hymselffe yt he was god, opēly saynge to ye Iewes,

                  Opera quae ego facio, testimoniū per hibent de me
               
               ▪ Remyttynge them to his warkes, yt by hys warkes and myracles, they moughte verely knowe what he was.
My warkes sayde he, dothe wytenes what I am. And emōges all his warkes, he cheffely proued hymselffe to be god, by the warkes he shewed in hys passion, by ye warkes he dyde in our redemptiō. In this passion, he shewed and playnely opened hym selffe, and gaue euydent notes and knowledge to the worlde, that he was veraye god.
In this passion he shewed hym selffe to be 
                  Virtus & sapientia patris,
                to be the vertue and power, the sapiēce and wysedome of the fadre.
In this passion, the fadre wolde the truthe thereof shulde be shewed & openly knowen.
Here in this passion 
                  Notam fecit dominus in populis uirtutem suam.
                He shewed hys vertue: he shewed openly to his people, yt this his sone was his vertue: and that by this his sone & by hys passion, he wolde warke vertue, and that the redemptiō of mā shulde be wrought by him, by his passion and deathe, and by hys precyouse bloode whiche shuldbe shedde in the same.
And that is it that foloweth in the same verse.

                  Redemisti in brachio populum tuū.
                Thou haste in thyne arme, redemed thy people.
            
               What is this arme of ye fadre? Ueryly ye, that afore he called Virtutem, hys vertue, Christe hys sone. For in an other psalme ye prophete saythe.
Sed dextera tua & brachiū tuū,
                     Psal. 43. Thre names of Christe, dextera / brachiū / illuminatio. Dextera dei.

Where ye prophete dothe describe Christe by thre names. He calleth hym Dexteram, brachium, & illuminationem. The ryght hande, the arme, and the lyght of the vysage of the fadre. Fyrst he called hym Dexteram, the ryght hande of the fadre. For Christe incarnate is signyfyed by the ryght hande.
And the reason after Ysodore is, for that, 
                  Dextera dicitur a dando.
               
The ryghte hande is called the ryghte hande of dando of giuynge, because that of olde, the token of peace was and yet is, giuen by the ryght hand. Demus dexteras hominibus istis, sayde the Machabees. Let vs strike handes with thē,

In the ryght syde is the origynall begynnynge of all the mocions and mouynges of the bodye: and all the ryght parties and membres on the ryght syde, are naturally stronger than the lyfte. For we se the righte hande, the righte arme, ye righte fote, is more ready in any thinge to do, thenne is the lyfte. And is set and goeth afore ye other almoste in all thynges. And is more

qwyuer, more quyke, more stronge and farre more ready and apte to the doinge of any thyng thenne is the lyfte. And we se by experience, whenne frendes that hathe be longe a sondre mete to gether, they take handes to gedre eueryche with other, not the lyfte handes, but the ryght handes. Whenne they also departe, they bydde fare well and shake handes, not the lyfte handes, but the righte. Whēne they make bargaynes to gether in token of performaunce of ther bergaynes, they strike handes together, not the lyfte handes, but the right handes. Whenne men hathe bene att variaunce, & ar ayen made attone, in token of truyse and peace, they take handes together, not lyfte handes, but ye right handes. So forasmoche as the righthande, is the chief hande ye man warketh wt, and is more ready, more hāsome & stronger of the two: god ye fadre wrought all, by Christe his righte hāde: he gouerneth all, by Christe his ryght hande: and shall iudge all, by Christe his righte hāde. And where he was in displeasure wt mā, & afterwarde toke truyse and peace with him, in token of a fyrme peace, he gaue man his righte hande, his sonne Iesu Christe. Whēne? Uerily whē he sent him down to take our nature vpon him: in tokē that he gaue his strenghe vnto vs, and wolde nomore strike vs with that hande vnles he be to fare prouok

And yf thou wylte besuere of this hand, bynde hym faste,Howm ā may bind the hand of God. and go not frome hym. Howe shalte thou bynde thys hande of God? By deuō

               de so faste,
                  Exodi. 32. that he moughte nott stryke. Whenne the Israelytes, (Moses beynge in the mounte wyth god and hadde receiued the lawes) hadde made them a calfe of golde and honoured itt for

theyr god. God shewed it to Moses, saynge that he wolde therefore destroye them.
And Moses maade intercession for his people besekynge god to spare them. And God sayde to Moses, 
                  Dimitte me, ut irascatur furor meus contra populum istum ut deleam eum.
               
Moses, saide God, Moses, Suffre me, Suffre me Moses to extende my furye anē
               ste these stubburn people. Suffre me to stryke, Suffre me to destroye them. To whome Moses sayde, O Lorde, O marcyfull god,

                  Quiescat domine iam ira tua & esto placabilis super malitiam populi,
                Lorde, cesse thy displeasure, hold thy hande, contented, haue compassion on thy people, forgyue them theyr iniquitye.
And itt foloweth in the lettre. Placatus est dominus. God was pacyfyed of hys displeasure and spared his people att ye requeste and instans of Moses. Loo christē people here may you see, howe Moses by prayour, stayde the hyghe displeasure of God, and helde hym yt he coude nott stryke: els wolde nott he haue sayde: o Moses suffre me, Suffre me Moses. Thou seeste nowe Good catholike man the grette pythe and vertue of true prayour.
            Praye therefore to thy lorde god yt he maye staye his stroke of vengeaunce, that he maye be mercyfull vnto the and to his people, yt he maye withdrawe hys punishynge hand, that he maye spare hys subiectꝭ. Holde hym by prayour, bynde hym by peticion, pacyfye hym by intercession,

stay hys wrathe by intear desyour and sewte. This hande dothe punyshe and dampne the synner: This hande dothe saue the penytente, thys hande dothe rewarde the good man, this hande dothe crown ye ryghtuouse person in the heuēs. And yff we lyue well and christianely this ryghte hande shall defende, protecte, guyyd, and saue vs: soo yff we lyue not christianely, itt shall punyshe,Christe is callid ye arme of God. Brachium
                destroye, and vtterly dampne vs. This sone of God is not onely called dextera the ryghte hande of god the fadre: but is also called Brachium the arme of the fadre.
Whiche worde brachium in scripture is many tymes taken Pro potentia & fortitudine, for power and strenghe, and for the sone of god. For the fyrste parte,

                Thane thou lord god, thou haste brought ye prowd man as lowe, as a man that is woundid.
And haste skaterd and dispersyd thyn enemyes in the arme of thy vertue, in thy sone. And as God dothe bringe downe by this hande and arme the prowde wretched synner, and disperse and putto flighte his enemyes: so dothe he ayen wyth his hand exalte, extoll & promote his humble seruandis, thoughe not att all tymes in this worlde, yett he wyll do itt in heuen, Where he wyll auanus hym wyth the felicitie and sighte of god, And that is itt that afore

Here now apperithe the grette vertue and power of this hande and arme of God. When that he in his passion dyd dysparge, conuicte & vtterly ouercome all his enemyes, deathe, synne, and the deuyll, and hathe spoyled the helles, and victoriously rose frome the dethe to lyff.

For after he hadde bene broughte before so many iudges, wher he was deryded, accused, and by false testimonye condempned to deathe, to the deathe of ye crosse: he was fyrste scourged, beate, and bare his crosse thorough ye Citye, to ye place of passion called Golgatha in the mounte of Caluary: where the Iewes whyche were apoynted to putt hym on the crosse, spoyled hym frome all that he hadde, frome his clothes and frome his apparell. They toke all frome hym, & lefte hym bare & naked wythoute ragge or bratte, annethe they lefte vpon hym femoralia, any clothe aboute the neyther partes of hys bodye. And yf they lefte somoche as that vpon hym, we reade itt not in the Gospell. Nor yett we reade that any thefe or malefactor hathe bene so nakydly spoyled, so nakydly lefte whenne he shulde suffre, as Christe was whenne he shulde dye. For they toke from him not oonly his outeward apparell, but also they spoylyd hym of hys secrette coote, and toke frome hym, tunicā inconsu tilem, a coote whiche was wythoute seeme, whyche cote they wolde not deuyd as they dyd hys other garmentis, but caste lotte who shulde haue it hoole.

                  In summo contemptu & irrisione: in grette horryble contempte & derisiō, whiche yt Iewes put Christe vnto.

                for a malefactor, for a contemptuouse person, and for an abbreacher of the lawe.
For whenne they came to take hym, they came as Christe him selfe witnessythe,

Whenne ye came to take me, ye came as the maner is to take a theffe: wt armure, with swerdes and battes, in the nyght tyme. And whenne I was dayly emonges you in the temple teachynge, ye toke me not, ye layd noo thynge to my chardge. Thus vylenously they toke Christe, they lugged hym to and froo: they strake hym, they buffetted hym, they bounde hym, they pulled hym by ye heare, they spytte vpon hym, they gaue hym buffattꝭ and strokes to to beyond home. They scourged hym wt oute pytye or compassiō, they clothed him in purple colour in derisiō, they crowned hym with thorne, they blyndefelde hym, they mocked hym, they put in his hande a reede in stedde of a cepture, And in mockage strake hym by course, & cryed, Tell vs who stryketh the nowe. And lykewyse strake hym aboute the hedde, cryynge, tell vs nowe who strake the? swapte hym vpon ye face, cryynge who was yt strake the now? who was that?
And kneled downe afore hym salutynge hym in derision, cryinge, 
                  Aue rex iudaeorum, Aue rex iudaeorum.
               
Hayle kynge of Iewes, Hayle kynge of Iewes. As so saye, thou takest thy selfe to

be kynge of Iewes, and nowe thou arte serued lyke a kynge, nowe thou arte crowned, nowe yu haste a ceptre in thy hande, nowe thou syttest in thy throne, in purpul colours, Nowe we honour thefor our kynge, Aue rex iudaeorum, Hayle kynge of Iewes. Undre this maner outragiously & beyond all estymacyō of man, they deryded and mockyd hym.
            
               The insaciable crueltie of the Iewes.And yett not beynge this contente, they had hym forthe ayen in praetorium, into the ye yeldhall before Pylate, neuer ceasynge but cryed, Iudge hym, condempne hym to the deathe, he is gyltie and wurthy to dye, let hym be crucifyed, let hym be hanged vpon the crosse: lett hym dye a shame full deathe, delyuer vnto vs Barrabas and condempne Iesus. Pylate hyring this raage, Answered I fynd noo cause in hym why he oughte to dye. Take you hym and crucifye him for I kā not. They sayde a yen, we haue a lawe, and after our lawe he oughte to dye. And yff thou lett hym thus goo, thou arte nott frende vnto Cesare. Whenne Pylate harde that, he sate down, he gaue iudgement and sentens anenst Christe, he committyd hym to theyre handes to crucyfye. They toke hym, they put of hys purple garmēt, and put on ayen his own apparell, yt he mought the better be knowen to ye Iewes, to hys shame & rebuke. They putt a grette hudge crosse vpon his backe, they ledde hym & haalyd him throughe

the citie, they broughte him to the place of execution, they gaue hym aysell and gall to drynke. They faryd so vngoodly wyth hym, that I thinke the Euangelistes (whyche were mooste discrete & soobur in their penne) wolde not for shame expresse all the vngoodly and shamefull maner of theyr ludibryes, of theyr wycked behauiours in this behalfe towardes Christe. But wyth as breue, pure and chaste penne as they coude they expressed, not the nombre of theyr euyl doynges, but onely in parte expressid Modum & formam, the maner & fasshyon of theyr doynges, of their derysions and conuiciouse wordꝭ, of ther outragious behauyours towarde Christe. So vndre thys maner was christe our sauiour on euery be halffe skornefully and mokkyshely handlede, vnmercifully treatyd:

Muche more we ought to suffre,
For chryste taught vs, that 
                  Per multas tribulationes oportet nos intrare in regnum dei,
                that we muste entre ye heuens by tribulacion and aduersitye.
So chryste taught vs, that penaunce is the veraye redye waye to heuen, the waye by the whyche Chryste and all his folowers came thidre:
                  Matth. 4. Ther for hee sayd, Poenitentiam agite: appropinquabit regnū dei.' Doo ye penaunce and that shall brynge you to ye kyngedome of God.

               The fyfte thynge that augmentyd the payne of this passion of our sauyour Ihesu chryste, was Persona pro qua passus est, ye persō for whome he suffrede. He suffrede for vs synners, for vs vnprofytable wretches, for vs vnkynde people, for vs his enemyes, beinge oute of ye fauour of God, stādinge in state of dāpnacyon: & yett he suffrede for vs. What more loue kowde ī thys worlde be shewed, thēne a mā to dye for hys enemies as ye harde afore? Here be we taughte loue & cherite, here we be taught to opē oure bowelles of mercye to oure poore neyghbours in tyme of necessitie,

to suffre payne for their cōforte, to suffre deathe rather then their soules shulde peryshe.
God gaue vs ensāple.

                christe suffrede for vs, leuynge you ensāple, howe ye shulde folowe his steppes.
Passꝰ est, he suffrede. Passus, he suffred. Why suffred he? he was no malefactour, he was no synner, he dyd no iniurye, he profeted euery bodye. Why dyd he thenne suffre? Passus est ꝓ nobis. He suffred for vs, why for vs? because we were synners, and borne the chyldren of wrathe and of damnacion. He suffrede therefore for vs, for our redemption, to redeme vs frome synne, to delyuer vs frome ye dewell, to saue & brynge vs into ye fauour of God. And for this dyd he suffre.

                  Vt sequa mini uestigia eius.
               
That we maye folowe his steppes, that we maye walke the waye he walked, yt we maye lyue the lyffe he lyued, as nyghe as the frayltye of nature wyll suffre. To suffre whēne itt shall fortune aduersitye, tribulacion, mysfortune, displeasure of the worlde, pouertye, myserye to chaūce: or suche other. To suffre for him, for he suffrede for vs. He is our hedde, we be hys membres. Therfore we oughte to conforme our selues to our hedde, christe.

mekenes. Punyshe thy malice, thy rankor & hatrede, with loue, zeale and charitye: thy slouthe and sluggyshenes, with true labour, toyle & good warkes: thy glotonye and bankettinge, wyth tē

And a yen for our parte saithe, 
                  Per multas tribulationes oportet intrare in regnum dei.
               
The veraye waye to heuen, is to lyue in muche trouble & aduersitye, to suffre muche payn and mysery.
            Let no man therefore, be soo suere of him selfe to saye. Christe hathe suffrede for me. Chryste hathe shedde his bloode and washed me. Christe hathe payde my rawnsome, he wyll not loose thys grette price: howe euer I lyue, he hathe redemed me: howe euer I lyue, I shall be sauede, I nede not to doo any penaunce for my synne, for Chryste hathe satisfyed for me. My syne is washed awaye, Itt is consumed and sowped vppe by vertue of this bloode. And suche other presūptuous wordꝭ they haue to mayntayn ther fleshely and carnall lybertye, to there own confusion and dampnacion. O meruelouse God what a presumpcion is this emonges vs Chrysten people?

what a blyndenes raigneth emonges vs: yt haue receued the lyghte of grace and knowledge of the lawes of God? Thoue chrysten man & womā I tell ye, that God is full of mercy, ye god is as full of mercy as we haue spoken of, and I assure the ayen, he is euen as iuste oon ye tother syde. God that here wyll remytte the synne of ye penytente, ther wyll condempne to deathe ye presumptuouse synner, the vnpenitent person, the wretchid lyuer. This iuste iudge god dothe requyre of the besydes the price of his bloode, penaunce: mercye towardes thy neyghbour, fear and dred of god, he requirethe of the a synner repentans, soroo, contricion, confession, he requyrethe of the a trewe faithe, a constante hoope, a feruēte charithe, and faithefull charitable warkes. He requyrithe of the, the obseruacion of his lawes, and to be a true feloer of hym. He requyrethe of the, to lyue in his obediency, in humilitye, in simplicite of herte, in clēnesse of that kind of chastitie that thou arte callyd vnto, he requyrythe of the to be constante in hym, to flee syne, to resyste temptacion, to loue vertue, and to walke in that callynge that thou arte callid vnto, to lyue cristianly. Scripture playnly dothe shewe all this and muche more yt is requyrid to a chrysten man to doo, The placꝭ wher, are manyfeste.

To haue you folowe his steppes, and to tell you of all hys steppes, of all his ensampulis, tyme wyll nott suffre. The some of the hooll tale is, that he shewed and proued hym selfe in all his doingꝭ to be veraye god.

And nowe he descended in to ye helles to pull vnto him ye resydue, the captiues that were ther? He drewe vnto hym all that were his electes in hell, whome the dewell tirannously dyd possesse.
He drewe vnto hym all,

Chryste bytte ye hell whenne he toke all wyth him that was his: and lefte those behynde that appertayned nott vnto hym. We see that, that a man killethe, he destroyethe itt vtterly, soo that itt shall haue nomore beinge, and that, that a man bytethe, he takes parte awaye and parte he leauethe. Therfore forasmoche as Chryste dydde vtterly slaye deathe in his electes, he was mors mortis, deathe to deathe. And for yt he toke parte owte of hell, & parte lefte ther: he dydde nott vtterly slee or kyll hell, but dydd byte itt: he toke awaye parte and lefte parte: he toke awaye the good and lefte the badde, he toke away the electꝭ & lefte the dānatꝭ.

And yf thou do thys wyth an inteare loue and with a highe deuocyō, It is not I that can expresse the inwarde solace and comforte that thou shalte haue, nor ye grette grace that shall ensue: Thou shalte fele itt thy selfe wythin the, but thou cāste nott expresse hit. Thoue shalte feale a lyghtnes in thy herte, a gladnes in thy stomake, a ioy in thy soule, a flamynge loue with in ye, a desiour to be wyth god: and god shalbe with the. And the more thy loue & desyour is knyt in him ye more surely, thou haste hym, the more shalbe thy inward vnctions, ye more grace is with the, the ner god is vnto the. And the more thy loue is in him, the more shall be thy deuocion: the more shalbe thy comforte, ye more shallbe thy Ioye, the more shall be thy rewarde: her by grace, ther by glorye, whyche Iesus, that is veary loue, that for loue of the, thys hathe suffrede: graunte the and vs all the glory that he hathe bought vs vnto by this his glorious passion.
