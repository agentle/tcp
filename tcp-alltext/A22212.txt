               SEinge the tyme and ſeaſon
of goſtly & ſpiritual warr̄ / that
is the holy tyme of lente
approcheth nere / & with his
goſtly trumpet calleth euery
man and woman to his ſtanderd
and place / thereto reſiſt
by harde & ſharpe penance / by continual prayer
and faſt / by abſtinence from iniquite and voluptuous

other charitable dedes / our goſtly ennemie the
dyuell / whiche with out reſte / by nyght & daye / by
ſee and lāde ſercheth whom he may deuoure:Luc. 3.
and brynge to perpetuall payne:Luc. 21. I thought hit
therfore very neceſſary and greatly expedient to
inuent and fynde ſome wayes and crafte (ſpecially
for the vnlerned people) to withſtande the
forſayde diſceytfull and puſant ēnemie:Tob. 4. 1. Pe. 5. whiche
thynge this my littel boke (if I be nat diſceiued)

and ſo that ye reder all though he haue but ſmall
lernynge / diligently liſten therto / and folowe the
frutefull preceptes therof / ſhal be with fewe wordes
ſo inſtructed / and ſo ſtrongly armed / that he
ſhall quickely ꝑceyue hym ſelfe to be inuincible / and
of habilite to fight / alſo (by goddis grace) to
withſtande his ennemye and optayne victorie.
This kynde of ſpiritual warre is nothinge lyke
the warr̄ of this worlde. In this ſpiritual warr̄
(if we wyll) be hit neuer ſo tedious / we be euerSap̄. 7
more ſure of victorie / of good name and fame / &
by cōtinuance / of ioye euerlaſtynge. Whiche ioye
and ꝑpetuall pleaſure they that enſue your wiſe
dome / your good and vertuous diſpoſition / do
highlyer eſteme than any worldly rycheſſe / whiche
worldly thynges be euer more as fletynge / as
celeſtial be ſtedfaſte. O than what a differēce
is this / yea what a pleaſure to be ſure of victory
and ther with ioye euerlaſtynge? And bicauſe I
haue conſydered / that your vertuous lyuynge / your
continuance in goodnes / and perfit loue to
the cōmunaltie / may beſydes the goodly and me
dicinable preceptes of this boke / the ſooner prouoke
the people to folowe goddis cōmandementes
/ to leaue their vicious lyuynge / and to arme
and prepare them ſelfe to withſtande the maliciouſnes
of our myghtifull and horrible ēnemy
the dyuell: after I had longe ymagined / I vtterly
determyned to dedicate this my rude trāſlacion
to your grace: that if neyther for goddis

ſake / nor by meanes of this boke they wyll nat
refrayne frō vice / yet they redynge your name / and
remembrynge your vertuous diſpoſytion / your
clene lyfe and chaſtite / ſhalbe the redyer to
hate yll and enſewe vertue / the prompter to forſake
vaniſhynge pleaſure / to enioye parpetual:Ro. 12.
and ſo either folowinge Chriſtis ſtanderde / that
is Chriſtis preceptes / orels the clene and pure
lyfe of ſome good chriſten womā / that is of your
grace / they ſhall at the laſte victoriously opteyne
(by goddis grace) the crowne and glorye of heuen.
For truely who ſo wyll opteyne victorie and
the fauour of god / and ꝑceyue the feates of this
ſpirituall warre / he muſte leaue all vicious lyuynge
and grondly obſerue goddis cōmaundementes
/ & folowe vertue.Mat. 19 For as vice is diſtroyer
of all thinges / ſo vertue in this felde / as in al
other cauſes is chiefe gouernour and maiſtres.Mar. 10
And to them parauenture that ſhall maruayle / wherfore

conquere vertue to folowe goddis cōmandementes / and
to enioye / ioye euerlaſtynge? Conſyderynge
than / that this warre for mannes ſoule
helthe is very neceſſary and holſome / I praye
and exhorte eche one to rede this lyttell treatiſe / conteynynge
the armour therof / and grondly to
folowe and continue in the profitable exhortacions
of the ſame. For why to rede only and nat to
practiſe that thou haſte redde / is nothynge. So
it maye be redde and folowed / that for vice man
ſhall opteyne vertue / and after the calamite and
wretchednes of this myſerable worlde / perpetuall

               REgnum ceſorum vim patitur. Matt. xi.
The kyngdome of heuen muſte
be gotte by ſtrengthe. Conſyderynge
than that heuen muſte be
cōquered bi force / labour / peyue / and
by chiualry / hit is neceſſary
for vs to be armed with all peces: as a knyght
that goeth eyther to batayle / or to the aſſaute of
any towne or caſtell. For hit were no wyſedome
to go thither vnarmed / conſiderynge the perils
and dangers of imbuſhementes / treaſon / and
encountrynge of our ennemies / whiche watche
ſtyll / and by crafte and ſubtiltie beſet the waye
that leadeth vs to heuē: to robbe / ſlee / murder / and
to brynge all them to eternall damnation / that
deſire to enioye the blyſſe of heuen / where
euery man coueteth to inhabite and dwell. Of
this waye Dauid ſaythe:Pſalmo Cxli. In via hac qua ambulabam
abſcondetunt laqueum mihi. that is to ſay / In
the way where I walked / they haue layde ſnares
and caltrappes / to catche and deceyue me.
But where ſhall we fynde this armour? And
who can inuente the ſubtilte and crafte to reſiſte
and withſtāde ſo many and ſo violēt ennemies?
Take thou Chriſtis armour / that is to ſay the
holy ſcripture / conteyninge in hit all vertue / the
whiche is the armour of the ſoule. whiche we alſo
muſte vſe agaynſt theſe thre ennemies / that
is agaynſt the worlde / the fleſhe / and the deuyl / whiche
thre neuer ceſſe to ſpie and deuyſe howe

to diſceyue and attrappe our ſoules with ſynne.
Iuxta illud. Mundus / caro / demonia diuerſa mouēt prelia.
The worlde / the fleſhe / and the deuylles lye
in imbuſhement to diſtroye and brynge to damnation
all thoſe that deſire the ioye euerlaſtinge.
And therfore for our ſure defence / hit is conuenient
that we be armed with the forſayd armour / that
is with vertue.The fyrſte pece of chriſtē armour. The fyrſte pece of this armour
is the ſhert of chaſtite / without whiche no
goodnes can be vertuous / as ſaynct Gregorie
ſayth in his Omelis: Nullum bonū eſt ſine caſtitate.
Chaſtite is likened to Biſſe / whiche is a kynd of
lynen clothe as white as ſnowe / and it groweth
in the partes of Egypt and Hieruſalem. This
lynen clothe er it come to his whitenes / ſuffreth
moche beatynge and wryngynge: In lyke maner
ſo doth chaſtite / er it come to the pure perfection
therof: that is to ſay / hit ſuffreth great affliction
/ in reſiſtynge the prickynges and temptacions
of voluptuous and fleſhely pleaſure.
Alſo as the ſhert is the fyrſt veſture of euery creature
/ ſo is chaſtite and virginite the fyrſte and
principalleſt vertue of al vertues. For the childe
bryngeth none othere thynge with it out of the
mothers wombe but onely virginite. Therfore
we ought greatly to loue hit / and diligētly kepe
hit. For commonly the father and mother loue
moche better theyr fyrſt frute / than the ſeconde
or the thyrde. Virginite is a vertue that highly
pleaſeth god and his angels: to the whiche angels as

ſayth ſaynt Hieronyme) virginite is nere of
kynrede. This vertue alſo is lykened to yuory / whiche
naturally is white / colde / and ſtronge.
So virginite and chaſtite is white by inocency / colde
by purenes of hert and body / ſtronge and
hardy to reſiſte the fleſſhely temptacions. Hit is
alſo to be noted / that whan yuory waxeth olde / hit
waxeth redde: So lyke wiſe chaſtite purely
and continually kept is a very martyrdome / as
writeth ſaynt Bernarde and ſaynt Hieronyme.
For why / To lyue chaſtely in this mortall body
is the lyfe of an angell: that is to ſaye it is more
to lyue chaſtely in this wretched worlde / than to
reyſe one from dethe to lyfe. Chaſtite alſo is lykened
to lylies for theyr manyfolde propreties / the
whiche now I let paſſe for brefenes of time / and
alſo bycauſe I haue copyouſly writen therof
in a nother treatiſe called the Garlande of ſpirituall
loue. But beſides that / I haue writen of
thre propreties. Lylies may nat ſuffre to be touched
or handled: For incōtinent after they be touched / be
hit neuer ſo littell / theyr whitenes doth
diminiſſhe / and they loſe theyr ſwete odour and
ſauour: In like maner as ſone as chaſtite is neuer
ſo littell vnhoneſtly touched / hit loſeth ꝑte of
the purenes and good ſauoure therof. The touchynge
alſo may be ſo vnhoneſt / as by reſon of
vile and ſtynkynge pleaſure / or conſente / that
virginite without any recouering therof / ſhalbe
corrupted for euermore. And therfore we ought

to kepe it charely.Howe virginite is obſerued and lrepte. But howe ſhall we kepe hit?
By great and harde penaunce: whiche is lykened
to a mans doublet / the whiche kepeth his
ſherete from all fylthines. For if a man ſhulde go
for the moſte parte in his ſhert / he ſhulde ſhortly
defyle it: So in like maner he yt doth nat ſharpe
and harde penāce in youthe and in age / vſynge
vile and roughe veſture / and kepynge well his
fyue wittes: there is no doubt but he ſhall ſoone
loſe chaſtite. For ſaynt Hieronyme my ſayth: A full
bealy inflameth quickely the holle body to vile
thoughtes and vayne pleaſure. And to the entent
we may ſhortely vſe and weare the forſayde
doublet ioyfully / it is requiſite that hit be dyed
in to purpull: that is / we muſte do penāce principally
for goddis ſake / remembrynge howe he
after his baptiſme wente in to wylderneſſe / and
there faſted .xl. dayes and .xl. nyghtes without
meate or drynke / alone amonge beaſtes: and
howe for vs he ſuffred many other labours and
ſmartes / as goynge nowe hither nowe thither
preachynge and teachynge / and for man endurynge
many other horrible tourmentes: Shewynge
and by that manifeſting / that without penaunce
we can nat aproche to the kyngdome of
heuen. Truely if we regarde and well conſider
the peynes that he ſuffred for vs / all penance / al
affliction / and all indurance (though it be neuer
ſo greuous) ſhal ſeme to vs to be without grefe
or peyne. Therfore let vs wyllingly do penance:

as well for goddis ſake as ſatiſfacciō of our ſynnes
/ & that we may kepe clene frō al vice & filthynes
our faire & clene ſherte of chaſtitie. Of theſe
two garmētes the wiſe mā ſayth: Biſſus et purputa
indument ſi eius.Prouet. xxxi. By biſſus is vnderſtāde chaſtitie
/ & by purpull the doublet of penaunce. This
doublet is likened to thornes / amonge ye whiche
goodly lylies growe / ſufferynge no hurte by the
thornes: Like wiſe chaſtitie is bett kept amōge
the ſharpe thornes of contricion & penance / than
amonge delicious pleaſures of this worlde.
After al this we muſt haue a peyre of ſcarlet hoſen / tyed
& faſtened to the forſayde doublet with
vii. poyntes. Theſe hoſen be the cōſyderacion of
the rewarde that the ſoule & the body to gyther
ſhal receyue in ye glory of heuē / for the ſharpe penāce
they endured in this worlde. The .vii. poȳ
               tes
be ye .vii. doweres / with whiche the ſoule & ye
body ſhalbe rewarded after ye reſurrectiō. There
is no penāce ſo ſharpe / but (if it be cloſed in theſe
hoſen / & ſurely tyed with theſe poȳtes) it ſhal be
made ſofte & light to be ſuffred & borne. As a mā
whā he is wel truſſed / is therefor moche ye lyghter:
So the cōſideracion of the gyfte & rewarde / whiche
we loke fore / maketh ſwete all peynes / whiche
we ſuffre in this worlde / as ſayth ſaynt
Gregory: Cōſideratio p̄mii minuit vim flagelli. After
all this we muſte haue ſhowes garnyſhed with
p̄cious ſtones called iacinctes / whiche in colour
be like ye bright ſkye: yt is to ſay / we muſte order

well the feet of our ſoule / that is our affections
with heuenly deſyre / couetyng to be out of this
worlde / and to come to the company of our lorde
god. Orels theſe ſhowes maye be vnderſtande
the good examples of holy faders / with the whiche
we ſhulde ſhowe our affections / that they
be nat woūded and hurte with the thornes of tēptacion
and tribulation. For as ſayth a holy doctoure:
There can be notynge ſo harde / but we
ſhall ſuffre it eaſely / if we thynke on and remembre
the good examples of holy fathers. And by
this meane our affections / whiche be called the
feet of our ſoule / ſhall ſurmounte and ouercome
all thornes of carnall and worldly deſyre / with
out any wounde of temptation. Of this the prophet
dothe remembre vs / ſayenge:Hie. 2. Prohibe pedem
tuum a nuditate. Take hede (ſaythe the prophet)
thou walke nat bare footed. He goth bare foted / that
ſetteth his affections on the carnall / erthely
/ and ſlyppery thynges of this worlde: whiche
be but erthe and durte. Suche folkes make
theyr hoſe and ſhowes of myer / as children do
that put their legges and feet in the myer / and
ſaye they haue put on theyr bowtes. Suche vilenes
dothe nat become kynges children: for they
oughte to be goodlye and gaylye ſhowde: and to
haue theyr ſhowes made as holy ſcripture declareth:Can. 7.
Quam pulchri ſunt greſſus tui in calciamentis filia
principis. O thou princis doughter howe goodlye
be thy feet and well garnyſſhed? This pryncis

doughter is the ſoule of euery one of them that
be the chyldren of god. Therfore we maye nat
walke bare footed / but we muſte haue our affections
well hoſed and ſhoode / with ſuche maner
of ſhowes as we before haue recited. And that
our affections be the feet of our ſoule / ſaynt Aguſtyne
bearethe witnes / ſayenge: Verius eſt anima
vbi amat / quam vbi animat: The ſoule (ſaythe he)
is more trulier there where it loueth / thā where
hit gyueth lyfe: that is to ſaye / than in the body.
For as the body is caryed from one place to
an other by the foote of man: So lyke wyſe the
ſoule is caried by mans deſyres and affections.
Therfore we ought to take hede / that we haue
good feet / and that we playe nat the aſſe / that al
waye ſtombleth. Suche aſſes be they that lyue
nat after goddis lawe and good reaſon: but ſuffer
them ſelfe to fal in deſire: and (as beaſtis vnreaſonable)
in to carnall and vnhoneſte affections.
Wherfore it is impoſſible for them to fynde
the waye to paradiſe / whiche is a ſharpe and a
ſtrayte waye. For why / theyr feet / that is theyr
affections be defyled and full of ſpottes / by reaſon
of ſyckenes / corruption / and fylthyneſſe.The legge harneis.
            
            Alſo we muſte nedes haue bowtes of yronne / that
is to ſay legge harneis: the one of them is
called ſtronge Pacience / the other Conſtance / pacience
ſyſter: the whiche kepe vp the ſoule in aduerſite
and tribulacion / that it ſtomble nat in to
deſperacion / or in to murmuracion. For lyke as

the legges & knees ſuſteyne all the dedes of the
body: So pacience and conſtance kepe the ſoule
in her eſtate / takynge good hede / that whan aduerſite
and tribulacion cometh / ſhe neyther falle
nor ſtomble. Therfore we muſte diligently watche
and labour to opteyne this vertue Paciēce:
and to kepe hit in the grace and loue of almyghty
god: if we wyll proſpere and kepe well ſuche
goodneſſe and vertues / as god hath gyuen vs:
The whiche ſayth in his goſpell:Luc. xxi. In pacientia veſtra
poſſidevitis animas veſtras: Ye ſhal poſſeſſe your
ſelfe and your ſoules / if ye haue pacience.
            After all this we muſte haue a coote of mayle / called
Iuſtice.The cote of mayle. Iuſtice is a vertue that aſcriueth
to euery man his owne. To god / honour & loue:
to man diſcipline and ſobreneſſe: and to his neighbour
good loue and dilection. But we by this
coote of mayle ſhall onely take and vnderſtande
the dilection and charite that we owe to our neighbour.
For as the mayles of this coote knytte
one mayle to another: So all good chriſten people
ſhulde be ioyned and knytte with the corde of
charite one to an other. For as a man / whan one
or two mayles are broken / is in great daungere
and peryll to be hurte and wounded: So in like
wyſe / whan a man loueth all his neyghbours / excepte
one or two / he is in peryll and daungere
(if he ſo departe hence) to be perpetually dampned.
The coller and the borders of this coote of
mayle / for the moſte parte is gylted: wherby is

vnderſtande / that god ought to be the begynninge
/ the ende / and the very cauſe why we loue
our neyghbours / orelles we ſhal be wounderſly
diſceyued. Therfore our lorde god ſayd to his diſciples:
Diligite inuicem / ſicut dilexi vos. Loue you
one an other as I haue loued you:Io. xiii. that is / loue
you eche other purely / and for the ſalute & helthe
of your ſoules / and nat for carnalitie / for flatterynge
/ for couetouſneſſe / orelles for any other yll
entente or yll ende.
         
         
            Of the bright armour.
The .ii. Chaptre.
            THat we may the better kepe this
forſayde cote of mayle / it is neceſſary we
haue bright harnes to put vpon hit. The breaſt
plate of this harneis is the conſideration of our
byrthe: The backe peece is the Meditation of
dethe. For whan that we groūdly conſider from
whenſe we came / and wherof we be made and
created with in our mothers wombe / that is of
the ſede of man and woman / whiche ſede is the
vileſt mattier that may be: I ſay if we conſider
theſe thinges: we ſhal diligently take hede that
we breake nat this coote of equite and Iuſtice:
that is to ſaye / we ſhall take hede we wronge no
man / nor hate none of our neighbours: nor yet
through pride auaunce our ſelfe aboue all other.
In lyke maner whan we profoūdely marke and

conſider our ende and the houre of our dethe (for
vndoubted we muſte all dye) we ſhall neuer be
wounded with the arowes or dartes of aduerſitie
or tribulation: nor yet fall to ſynne by impacience
or murmuration. For we knowe ſurely / that
dethe ſhall be the ende of our trybulation / and
the begynnynge of our ioye and conſolation.
And all the troubles and aduerſytes of this
worlde / be nat to be compared (as ſaynct Paule
ſayth) to the glorie / rewarde / and crowne that
we loke fore. Non ſunt condigne paſſiones huius temporis
ad futuram gloriam / que reuelabitur in nobis.Ro. 8. Our
aduerſaries / whether they be viſible or inuiſible
whā ſo euer they trouble vs / they do none other
thynge (ſo that we be nat agaynſt hit) but only
prepare for vs the crowne of glorye and euerlaſtynge
ioye. Therfore Dauid ſaythe: Supra dorſum
meſi fabricauerſit peccatores.Pſalmo Cxxviii. The ſynners (ſayth
Dauid) and myne aduerſaries haue forged vpō
my backe a crowne of glorie. Than to the entent
we be nat ouer throwen by aduerſitie and tribulacion
/ lette vs take thys good backe peece and
ſtronge armoure / the meditation of dethe. For
ſaynt Hierony me ſayth: Faciſe contemnit omnia qui
cogitat ſemper ſe eſſe moriturum. He lyghtly diſpiſeth
all thynges / and wyllyngly ſuffereth tribulacion
/ that euer more thynketh he muſte dye.
         
         
            Of the Vambrace. The .iii. Chap.
            
               
ALſo we muſt haue our Vambraces
to defende vs agaynſt the labour of
this mortal fyfe. For as it is writen / anone after
a man is borne / he cometh to labour and peyne:
Homo naſcitur ad laborē. et nō ad te quiē.Iob. v. Man is borne
to labour & peyne / & to no reſte. Hit is neceſſarye
we labour in this worlde / that we maye come to
the glory of heuē. But to thende we be nat ouerpreſſed
by labour / we muſt haue a ſtaffe to ſtaye
vs by / & ſomwhat to reſt vs on. This ſtaffe ſhal
be the vertue of ſtrengthe / whiche is lykened to
a rodde or to a ſtaffe. For ſtrengthe cauſeth man
that no labour or payne of this mortal lyfe may
ouer come hym: and hit gyueth hym ſuſtentacion and helpe / ioye / and conſolation / as Dauid
ſayth in his ſpalme:Pſal. 2 Virga tua et baculus tuus ipſa
me conſolata ſunt. Strengthe is alſo compared &
lykened to iron / that breaketh and diſtroyeth all
thynge. In lyke maner the vertue of ſtrengthe
breaketh all thynge / and reſiſteth al the paynes
of this mortall lyfe / as hit appereth by the holy
and bleſſed martyrs / whiche were neuer ouercō
               men
/ but haue hadde all way the victorye of all
theyr aduerſaries. Of whome it is writen: Mori
poſſunt / ſed fletti non poſſunt. The tyrannes haue
power to kylle and ſlee the bodyes of goddis frendes:
but they haue nat the power to turne them
to theyr wyll and myndes.

THan for vambraces lette vs take
the vertue of ſtrengthe: But with theſe
vambraces we muſte nedes haue two gauntelettes
to couer our handes / that is / Declinare a
malo et facere bonum.Pſal. 30 The fyrſte is to decline from
yll / and ther with to flee all occaſions of ſynne:
The ſeconde is to do well: and to ſeke all occaſions
and wayes (as nere as we may) to do well.
And we muſte nedes haue bothe theſe gauntelettes:
for one without the other can nat ſuffice.
         
         
            Of the Gorget / and what it is.
The fyfte Chaptre.
            FOrthermore we muſt put on our
gorgette / whiche is very neceſſarye to auoyde
the cuttynge of our throtes. This Gorgette
is abſtinence / ſobreneſſe / and temperance:
without the whiche we be in perill of dethe. For
the ſcripture ſaythe / that many moo dye by exceſſe
and ſurfettes / than by the ſworde: Plures
occidit gula quam gladius. And nat onely by ſpirituall
dethe of the ſoule / but alſo by corporall dethe
of the body. For / as well nere all phiſicions and
philoſophers ſaye / all corporall ſyckeneſſe / that
we ſuffce / cometh (for the moſt parte) by exceſſe
of meates and drynkes. For theſe cauſes this
gorgette is neceſſarye to defende vs bothe from
ſpirituall and corporall dethe. This gorgette ſerueth
alſo for an other entente. For hit kepeth a

man from vayne and ydell wordes / from detraction
and hurtefull communycacyon: and lyke
wyſe from all maner of leaſynges / whiche often
tymes woūde man to dethe: and alſo (as ſaynt
Paule ſaythe) they cauſe god to dyſdayne and

                  . Detractatores deo odibiles. God hatethe
thoſe / that backebyte theyr neyghbours.Sap̄. 
                     •
                  
                And
the wyſe man ſaythe: Os quod mentitur, occidit animam:
A lyenge mouthe kylleth the ſoule. And
our lorde in the goſpell ſaythe:Mat. xii. De omni verbo ocioſo
quod loquuti fuerint homines, reddituri ſunt rationem
in die iudicii. Of all ydell wordes ſpoken of man / man
at the day of iugement ſhall gyue accōpte.
O howe harde a ſentence is this to many a mā / ye
and wel nere to all ye worlde? Saynte Iames
ſaythe / that he is a perfecte man / whiche can refrayne
his tounge: but there be very fewe that
can do it. And for al that we muſte nedes labour
to refrayne hit: for bothe dethe and lyfe is in the
handes of the tonge.Pro. xviii Mors & vita in manibus lingue.
Dethe / whan the tonge is nat wel kepte: Lyfe / whan
it is kepte and refrayned from yll. There
is no man that can nombre the myſchiefes that
come of to many vndiſcrete wordes and communicacion.
Therfore temperance is very expedyent
& profitable for vs / to knowe howe we ſhuld
order and gyde this our lyttyll tonge: to the entente
we diſpleaſe nat our maker / nor yet hurte
our neighbour: and to the ende our ſoule be nat
taken by her ennemies / whiche euer more and

with contynuall watche / ſpye and ſerche none other
wyſe the febleſte and weakeſte parte of the
cite of the ſoule / than men of warre ſerche the febleſte
place of that citie / whiche they entende to
conquere and take by force of armes. I thynke
there is no place in mannes body more weaker
than the tonge or the mouthe. For if the taſte of
man be nat well ſeaſoned / well temperedde / and
well taken hede of / hit is the foode and nouriſhement
of lechery / and of all other fylthyneſſe. If
the tounge be nat refrayned / hit is the occaſion
of anger / trouble / diſcorde / diuiſion / hatred / diſcencion
/ and of other ylles innumerable. Therfore
we ought in this thynge to vſe diligēce / and
to purchace bothe ſobreneſſe and temperaunce.
For he ought to kepe his mouthe both clene and
net / that dayly muſte with god ſpeke.
         
         
            Of the Helmet / and what it is.
The ſyxte Chaptre.
            EArther it is conuenient and neceſſary
that we put on the Helmet of helthe:
as ſaynct Paule dothe monyſſhe vs / ſayenge:Eph. vi.
Et galeam ſalutis accipite. This helmet is the feare
of god / that puttethe backe all aduerſities and
ſtrokes: and (as ſaynct Paule ſaythe) is neuer
broken.Eccle. 1. Timor domini expellit peccatum. The feare
of god putteth backe all ſynne: and without hit
no man can be iuſtified. Bleſſed is he that hath

this helmette vpon his heed contynually: that
is to ſay / vpon his thought: whiche is the heed
of the ſoule / as ſaynt Gregorie ſayth. The feare
of god dothe in lyke maner to the ſoule / as the
watche man dothe / that is in the towre of a caſtell / whiche
only walketh vp & downe / lokynge
and prienge out on euery ſyde / to ſpie if any enemyes
come. And as he oftē tymes awaketh the
knyghtes and men of armes / that be in the fortreſſe
and caſtel: euen ſo doth the feare of god in
the caſtell of the ſoule / whiche dayely ſturrethe
vp the ſtrengthe and vertues of the ſoule / to relyſte
the princypall ennemies / that wyll enbatayle
/ fyghte / and lette her to the vttermoſte of
theyr power / to come to the celeſtiall ioye & pleaſure
of Paradiſe. Theſe thre ennemyes ben called
the worlde / the fleſſhe / and the deuyll: whiche
be layde in enbuſhementes and companyes
for to deſtroye all the frendes of our lorde Ieſu
Chriſte. This good Helmette dothe beare of all
thynge / and all thynge fearethe hit. For as the
philoſopher ſaythe:Eccl. 7. Qui timet deum, omnia timent
eum. All thynge feareth hym / that feareth god.
And this Helmet is well and proprely ſet / in the
moſte nobleſte and hygheſt place of mannes body.
And there / where the fyue corporall wyttes
haue principally their vigure and place. For the
feare of god is like a ſtronge vſſher or porter / the
whiche kepeth the fyue gates of our fyue wyttes:
and the ſecrete wyckette of our harte. And

bicauſe 
                  ••
               e feare of god muſte ſomtyme watche
and at on
                  ••
                at all theſe fyue gates / hit is neceſſarye
hit haue ſome helpe. The helpe ſhalbe longe
prouiſion / whiche is lykened to the viſour of the
helmette / wher in be many ſmall holes: by the
whiche he ſeeth here and there. And alſo he lyfteth
hit vppe and putteth hit downe at his pleaſure.
So it is by prouiſion: For prouyſion hath
many thoughtes and ſubtile conſiderations: by
the whiche it ſeeth and perceyueth longe before
the aduerſites and dangers that maye chaunce
to the ſoule by this or that meane or operation / or
this thoughte or delectacion. Prouyſyon alſo
ſeeth longe before al diſceites and embuſſhementes
of her ennemyes: and ſheweth them to this
good porter / called the feare of god / whiche with
out delaye cauſeth all ſuche thinges / that maye
hurte the ſoule / to auoyde and departe: and lettethe
in all ſuche thynges / that maye helpe the
ſoule.Eccl. 7 For as hit is written: Qui timet deum, nihit
negligit. That is to ſaye / He that dredeth god eſcheweth
all yll: and dothe to his power / all that
good is. So we ſe howe this Helmette is profitable
to the ſoule / to defende the heed / that is the
harte / and the thought. But with this / it is conueniente
to haue vpon this Helmette a gylden
creſte. For we be all or ſhulde be the knyghtes of
our lorde Ieſu Chriſte. By this gylden Creſtegarnyſhed
with a precious ſtone named Serdonique
/ is ſygnyfied the vertue of Hope / whiche

ought to be well tyed and pynned to this helmet
that is to the Feare of god. For Hope with out
the feare of god is nothinge / nor of no value. For
to great feare maye caſte maunes ſoule into deſpeyre:
and to great hope may caſte mānes ſoule
in to pryde and preſūpcion. Therfore they muſt
be alwaye well myngled and knytte to gether.
The foreſayde precious ſtone hath thre colours:
the loweſt parte is blacke: the myddell parte is
whyte: the higheſt parte is redde. In lyke maner
the vertue of hope cauſeth a mā to diſpreyſe
and lyttell regarde theſe vyle and worldly thynges
/ as of no value / but full of cloudes and darkeneſſe.
Alſo hit makethe the myddell parte of
man / that is mannes harte and bodye whyte:
that is to be chaſte and without ſynne: ſhewing
hym (if he lyue vertuouſly) what rewarde and
glorie he ſhall optayne / in the celeſtiall courte of
paradiſe. Alſo hope maketh a man redde / that
is burnynge in the fyre of charite and loue bothe
of god and of his neighbour. This vertue (the
creſte) is very neceſſarye for them that be in trybulacion
/ and in cōtinuall batayle agaynſt their
ennemyes: and therfore it behoueth vs to take
good hede / that it fayle vs nat at our moſt nede.
We muſte alſo be diligent and take good hede we
truſte nat in man: for if we do / we ſhalbe diſceyued.
And they that truſte in men / be acurſed by
the prophet Hieremie / ſayenge:Iere. 17▪
                Maledictus vir,
qui confidit in homine. That man is accurſed / that

truſtethe in man / or in any wordlye thynge / or
in his ſtrengthe / or in his wyſedome / or in his
owne merites. For he ſhall conſume and wither
away / lyke as the genepre tree dothe in wylderneſſe:
that is to ſay / he ſhall loſe and be depriued
of all the humour of grace and deuocion. But he
that putteth his confidence / hope / and truſte in
god / is onely bleſſed / and he ſhall walke without
danger or peryll / through the myddes of his aduerſaries
and ennemies / vntyll he ſhall come to
the ende of his iourneis / that is to the citie of paradiſe.
Of whiche thynge the prophet beareth
wytneſſe / ſayenge: Qui autem ſperant in domino mu
tabunt fortitudinem. aſſument alas vt aquile. ambulabunt
et non laborabunt. &c.Eſa. 40 They that put all theyr confidence
and hope in god / ſhal waxe euery day ſtrō
               ger
and ſtronger: and ſhall take wynges as an
egle / to flee vnto the trone of the diuine maieſte:
they ſhall go without peyne. For why / all peyne
and afflixcion ſhall ſeme to them to be ſwete and
without payne / bycauſe of the deſyre that they
ſhal haue to come to theyr entent / that is to god / 
and ſo to eternall ioye and pleaſure.
         
         
            Of the two edged ſworde.
The .vii. Chaptre.
            AFter all thoſe thynges it is requiſite / that
we haue our two edged ſworde
gyrded aboute vs. Theſe be the wordes

of god: Gladius bis acutus. Of the whiche ſworde
ſaȳt Paule ſayth:Eph. vi. Et gladiū ſpūs. quod eſt verbū dei.
Take thou (ſayth ſaynt Paule) ye goſtly ſworde
that is the worde of god. This ſworde cuttethe
on bothe ſydes: for it hath power to diſtroye and
kylle bothe body and ſoule: as it is wryten in the
goſpell. we oughte (as Dauid ſayth) euer more
to haue this ſworde in our hande.Pſal. 149 Et gladii ancipi
tes in manibus eorum. And to what entente? Ad faciendam
vindictam in nationibus. To take vengeance
vpon thoſe nacions / whiche be contrarye to the
ſoule. But who ſhall put this thynge in execucion?
Dame Iuſtice. For it is writen by our lorde
Ieſu Chriſte / whiche is the worde of god: Eterit
iuſticia cinguſum lumborum eius.Eſa. xi. This vertue Iuſtice
is very well ordred and put about mannes
raynes: For hit is the moſte daungerous place
and wey of mannes body: by the whiche mans
ſoule is moſte vexed and troubled: and ſpecially
by the abominable and horrible ſynne of lechery.
Dauid beareth wytnes / ſayenge: Quoniam
lumbi mei impleti ſunt illuſionibus.Ioh. xi. My raynes be replenyſhed
with illuſyons / that is with fleſſhely
deſire / thoughtes / pleaſures / and pollucions:
whiche in that place haue theyr ſeate & myght:
as it is wryten in Iob: Virtus eius in lumbis eius.
The vertue of the deuyll is in the raynes of mā.
For Luxure is the ſynne / by the whiche our ennemye
the deuyll leadeth many a one to eternall
damnation. Therfore it is neceſſary that dame

Iuſtice haue her ſeate there: and that ſhe haue
alwayes this ſharpe ſworde in her hande / that
is the worde of god / to do Iuſtice: and to take
vengeance on thoſe that wolde depriue the ſoule
of the noble and precious treaſure of Chaſtitie.
For commonly where as good and ſharpe Iuſtice
is / ſuche trewantes and ſuche theues dare
neither ſporte / nor yet ſhewe them ſelfe. And ſo
lyke wyſe it is of mannes ſoule: whiche contynually
punyſheth all yll mocions / ſuggeſtions / fleſſhely / and
worldlye temptacions. And alſo
with this ſharpe ſworde they dymynyſſhe and
chaſtiſe theyr ennemyes / that is theyr deſyres / theyr
affections / all hurtefull and vntemperate
cogitacions and thoughtes. For why / as ſoone
after as ſhe hath perceyued theyr diſceytes and
their aſſautes / Iuſtice taketh and reherſeth the
worde of god / and the auctorities of holy ſcripture:
with the whiche ſhe compelleth all her ennemies
to recule & gyue backe / as our lorde dyd
whan the fende tempted hym with thre temptacions / in
the whiche all other are cōteyned. Our
lorde anſwered hym nothynge / but he proued it
by the worde of god / and by holy ſcripture / comprehended
in the boke called Exodi. The whiche
auctorities the dyuell coude nat brooke / nor yet
ſuffre. And throughe the vertue of theſe holy
wordes / he was beaten backe and ouercōmen / as
hit had ben with a ſharpe ſworde: and ſo he
lefte our lorde / and departed to his owne confuſion.

In lyke maner the ſoule in all temptacyon
muſte expreſſe and brynge fourthe the worde of
god: whiche (as ſaynt Paule ſaythe) is moche
more ſharpe and perſynge / than any raſoure or
two edged ſworde:Hab. 4 Viuus eſt ſetmo dei et efficax, et
penetrabilior omni gladio ancipiti. It is than a ſure
thynge to be alwaye gyrded with this ſworde / whiche
muſte hange on our lefte ſyde / by ye corde
of Iuſtice and equitie / agaynſt our raynes and
our thyes: In the whiche two places the moſte
daungerous and fearefull aduerſaries of mans
ſoule dwell. Therfore holy ſcripture reherſeth / that
.lxxx. of the ſtrongeſt men of Iſraell compaſed
kynge Salomons bedde / whiche kynge Salomon
repreſenteth our lorde Ieſu Chriſte / whiche
reſteth hym ſelfe in the deuoute ſoule of mā / as
the ſworde dothe in the ſcabarde: And eche
of the forſayde myghty men had his ſworde vpon
his thygh (propter timores nocturnos) for drede
of the diſceytes / and ſecrete aſſautes of theyr ennemies / whiche
moſte cōmonly worke by night:
that is / in the nyght of ſynne / or of ignoraunce.
For the ſynne of luxure and lechery is moſte cō
               monly
done by nyght / in cloudy and darke places.
And alſo betwene them that be maried / the
whiche maye vſe the courſe of nature withoute
ſynne / ſo they vſe hit to a good entent / and temperately.
The reaſon here of is / as ſaythe ſaynt
Auguſtine / in his boke called the Cite of god / to
open and ſhewe the tranſgreſſion of our fore fathers

/ of whome we that be come / by the ſede of
man and woman / be dettours / and muſte anſwere
therfore. The Scabarde or ſhethe of this
ſharpe ſworde is the hart of man / in the whiche
the worde of god oughte to be / and there to reſte
contynually.
         
         
            Of the dagger. The
viii. Chaptre.
            BUt with theſe weapons & inſtrumentes
of warre we muſte nedes haue a
dagger by our ſyde / and our hande there vpon
euermore: that is to ſaye / we muſte put in effect
and execute the worde of god / and his comaūdementes.
For hit is nat inoughe to knowe them
onely / but we muſte put to our handes to worke
and fulfyll them / that is to ſay / we muſt lay our
handes vpon our dagger. This thynge was figured
in the chyldren of Iſraell / after theyr returnynge
from the captiuite of Babylon / in the
tyme of Nemee: whiche Nemee / with the children
of Iſraell / dyd edifie and buylde the temple
and walles of Hieruſalem agayne. And bycauſe
theyr ennemyes were moleſtyous and greuous
vnto them / he ordeyned / that they the whiche laboured
in edifienge of the temple and walles of
Hieruſalem / ſhulde haue a ſworde in the one of
theyr handes / and with the other hande / they
ſhulde laboure.
         
         
            
            Of the Shelde. The.
nynthe Chaptre.
            AFter thoſe thynges it is neceſſary
for vs to take the Shelde of fayth / as
ſaynt Paule warneth vs to do: with the whiche
we may quenche / and vtterly diſtroye / and with
ſtande all the dartes of our ennemie the deuyll:
whiche dartes be replenyſſhed with the fyre of
carnall concupiſcence / of couetouſnes / of pryde / and
of vayne glorie: whiche .iii. be the .iii. principall
dartes of our ennemye. Vnto whiche thre
we maye applye all other / as ſpryngynge and
engendred of them. And lyke as we beare our
ſhelde on our lefte ſyde: So we ought principally
to take the ſhelde of faythe in tyme of aduerſitie.
And that we beare our ſhelde on the left ſyde
of our hart / is bycauſe (as the philoſopher doth
ſaye) the harte of man is betwene his breaſtis / inclinynge
to his lefte ſyde. Wherby is ſignified
that the harte of man is more enclyned to vyce
than vertue / as our lorde god ſayth to Noe: Sen
ſus enim et cogitatio cordis humani in malum prona ſunt
ab adoleſcentia.Gen. 8 Therfore we oughte to putte the
ſhelde of faythe before the harte. For hit is his
propre harneys. Faythe is alſo vpon the ryght
eie of the ſoule and of reaſon: the whiche gyueth
no iugement / but of naturall thynges: but yet
faythe iugeth nat onely thynges naturall: but
alſo ſuche thynges as be aboue nature: and beleueth

that that reaſon can nat diſcuſſe or comprehende.
And as he that hath loſt his ryght eie
is nat mete to be in batayle: bycauſe he can nat
ſhote ryght / nor ſe howe to auoyde ſtrokes: So
he that hath no fayth / is nat mete to be in ſpirituall
batayle. Therfore the poſtels deſyred our
lorde to augmēt theyr fayth / that ſo they myght
be able to fyght agaynſte the dyuell of helle and
his ſoudiours.Luc. 17 Domime adauge nobis fidem. This
ſhelde in his vpper parte is large / & narowe in
the lower parte: ſo faith is large in ye loue of god
& celeſtiall thinges: & narowe in thoſe erthely &
worldly thinges. This ſhelde hath .iii. corners:
And fayth beleueth ye Trinite to be but one god.
Theſe thre corners muſte be garnyſhed with .iii
precious ſtones: with a Iaſper / a Saphir / and
a calcidone. Iaſper is grene: and whan ſo euer
any herbe or plante is grene / it is a token of lyfe.
In lyke maner whan any man deſyreth honeſte
and good maners: it is a token his harte lyueth
by ryght and true faythe. This precyous ſtone
Iaſpe auoydeth all fantaſies and yll illuſyons:
Trewe faythe chaſeth away all dyuellyſhe tēptacions.
The ſeconde precyous ſtone is called a
Saphir his coloure is blewe / his propretie is to
take a waye venome / and to kyll ſpiders: So in
lyke wyſe true faythe regardethe onely celeſtiall
thinges / and reputeth theſe worldly thynges to
be of no vertue. Faythe alſo dryueth backe and
vtterly dothe kylle the poyſonfull temptacions / and

yll mocions of mannes harte: as the holy a
poſtels haue wryten:Act. xv Fide purificans corda eorum.
The thyrde precious ſtone is called Calcidone:
whiche in coloure is very paale: whoſe nature
and propretie is to caſte backe all deed thynges:
Lyke wyſe the true fayth is pale: that is to ſay / by
great and ſharpe penaunce / mortifienge and
auoydynge deedly ſynne and all the occaſions of
ſynne / hit maketh man paale. If we beare and
vſe well this ſhelde / we can nat be woūded with
dartes nor arowes viſible nor inuiſible.
         
         
            Of the Speare The.
tenthe Chaptre.
            BUt to the entent we wante nothinge
neceſſary for this warre / we muſt
haue and beare a ſpeare in our hande: that is / we
muſte ſhewe good exampulles to our neyghbours
/ that they therby may glorifie and laude
ye goodnes of god: and nat bycauſe we wolde or
yet loke to be preiſed therfore: as our lorde ſayth
in his holy goſpell: Luciat lux veſtra coram hominibus,
vt videant opea veſtra bona.Matt. v. It is alſo to be noted
/ that one man ſhulde ſooner hurte an other
a farre of with a ſpeare / than with a ſwerde: So
we ſhall ſoner ſtere men to do and to lyue well by
good example / than onely by good wordes: as a
certeyne doctour ſaythe: Plus mouent exempla quā
verba. This ſpeare muſte be of a great lengthe

by perceueraunce in goodneſſe. For hit is nat ynough
to do well for a whyle / but we muſte contynue
therin. The continuance in goodnes doth
onely cauſe man to deſyre the crowne of heuen.
And they onely ſhall be ſaued / that contynue in
goodnes / and kepe goddis commandementes:
as our lorde ſayth in the goſpell:Matt. x. et. xxiiii. Qui autem perſeuerauerit
vſque in finem, hic ſaluus erit. This ſpeare
alſo muſt be ſtreyghte by the helpe and meanes
of good intention. For who that eyther lyuethe
well by hypocriſie for vayne glorie / or any other
yll intencion / he ſhall neuer gyue good buffette
with this ſpeare / bicauſe hit is croked. We muſt
do good pryncypally for the loue of god / for our
ſoule helthe / and to inſtructe our neighbours in
goodnes and vertue: whan ſo euer we do hit for
this entente / than our ſpeare is ſtreyghte and
ſharpe / and redy to ſtryke and wounde deedly / that
is to ſay / it is redy to prouoke other to goodnes
/ and to loue god aboue all thynge. Farther
more no man may ſmyte with this ſpeare with
out he holde hit low / and vnder his right arme:
nor in lyke caſe no man may do hym ſelfe good or
his neyghbour / excepte he deſyre that his good
dedes maye be kepte cloſe: and withoute he do
them only for goddis ſake. And whan we thus
ſhal do our good dedes: we muſt holde our ſpere
vnder our ſadylle: but god ſhall lyfte hit vp / and
brynge hit to lyghte / and in to ſyghte of other:
as hit is writen in the holy goſpelle: Non poteſt ciuitas

abſcondi ſupra montem poſita.
         
         
            Of the Coote armuur
The .xi. Chaptre.
            SEinge we haue all the deuoure
armoure of the ſoule / where of we haue
ſpoken: it is nedefull we ſpeke ſome what of the
coote armoure / whiche is worne vpon all other
harneis: in the whiche alſo be peynted and drawen
the armes of that lorde / whiche we fyghte
fore. This coote armour is made after the faſhion
of a cloke / ſette with golde / ſyluer / precious
ſtones / and other ryche and dyuers coloures.
This Coote armoure is lykened to the vertue of
Charite / whiche is called Chriſtis lyuery / wherby
he knoweth all his knightes and frendes / as
he ſayde to his diſciples:Io. 30 In hoc cognoſcent omnes,
quia diſcipuli mei eſtis, ſi dilectionē habueritis adinuicem.
By thys thynge (ſaythe our lorde) menne ſhall
knowe you to be my diſciples / if ye loue eche other
charitably. Charite is a vertue / the whiche
willeth vs to loue god with all our hartes / with
all our myndes / and with all our thoughtes / &
to loue our neighbours as our ſelfe. But bicauſe
here afore / whan we reherſed the coote of mayie
we ſpake of the loue that we oughte to beare to
our neyghbour: we wyll at this tyme ſpeke of
the loue / whiche we oughte to haue to god: the
whiche is aboue all thynge: and therfore let vs

putte hit aboue and vpon all our other harneis.
In this coote armour muſte be many precious
ſtones / and prīcipally thre / that is a Criſolite / a
Berill / and a Thopaſy: the whiche ſignifie that
charite ought to procede from a pure harte and
a good conſcience: alſo from a true fayth. Criſolitus
is a precious ſtone and a noble / ſparklynge
lyke the fyre: and if ye ſette hit nere the fyre / by
and by hit wyll be all in a flame. The fyre is of
very pure nature and vertue: for hit taketh away
the ruſtynes and all fylthynes from golde / ſyluer / &
all other metall / and maketh hit bright
and ſhynynge: So in lyke maner the fyre of charite
remoueth from mans harte all fylthynes of
ſynne / and purifieth the ſame: and as the precious
ſtone Criſolitus loueth the fyre / in ſo moche
that hit drawethe the fyre to hit / if hit be nere:
So in lyke wyſe dothe a pure and a clere harte / approchynge
to god / whiche is the fyre that conſumeth
all ruſtynes of ſynne / as Moyſes ſayth:
Deus tuus ignis cōſumēs eſt.Deu. 4 Therfore euen as ſone
as ye harte of man draweth nere this fyre / with
burnynge deſire & feruēt loue / he draweth to hȳ
the loue of god. And therfore our lorde deſiringe
to enflame vs with this fire of charite / he came
kyndely and louyngly vnto vs / and receyuedde
this fleſſhely body / & ſhedde his precious bloud
for our helthe and redempcion: Wherby he ſhewed
manifeſtly / howe hartely and howe feruētly
he loued vs. Therfore we muſt light our fire / 

that is our loue at his great fyre / and furnace / approchynge
nere therto by pureneſſe of harte
and body. For the wyſe man ſayth / that a ſoūde
and a pure harte cauſeth man to be nere to god / and
greatly in his fauour. The ſeconde precious
ſtone is named berillus / whoſe colour is grene / and
ſome what pale: hit hath ſixe corners / and
ſygnyfyeth that the parſone / whiche hath charite
is alway grene by good operacion and good
workes / whiche he ſheweth to his neyghboure / by
the .vi. workes of mercy / the whiche the .vi.
corners of this precyous ſtone ſygnyfieth. The
palenes therof betokeneth mortifienge & chaſtiſinge
of ye body. The .iii. ſtone is called thopaſe / whiche
hath .ii. nobul colours: that is the colour
of the ſkye / & ye colour of golde. The colour of ye
ſkye ſignifieth the loue that we owe to god: the
colour of golde ſignifieth ye loue yt we owe to our
neighbour. And as this topaſe excedeth ī brightnes
al other ſtones: ſo charite excedeth ye nobilitie
of all other vertues: as ye apoſtle ſayth: Maior
autē horū eſt charitas.1. Co. 13 And as this thopaſe receyueth
& hath in it ſelfe ye qualities of all other precious
ſtones: So Charite dothe and exerciſeth
the dedes of all other vertues: as hit appereth
in the piſtols of ſaynct Paule / where he ſaythe:1. Co. 13
Charitas patiens eſt. &c. And therfore a certayne doctour
called Proſpere / in his boke of contemplacion
ſaythe / that Charite is the ſoule of all vertues.
For as the ſoule gyueth lyfe and ſtrengthe

to the fyue corporall wittes: as vnto the eſe / the
ſyght: vnto the eares / herynge: So lyke wyſe
Charite openeth the eie of mannes harte to the
helpe and comforte of poure folke: his eares to
harken to goddis commaundementes: and his
handes to do the good warkes of mercy: and ſo
forthe of other vertues / with the whiche ye cloke
of Charite is garnyſhed and rychely apparayled
/ as hit were with ſyluer / golde / precious ſtones
/ and other goodly and dyuers colours: As
our lorde god ſaythe by the prophet vnto the deuoute
ſoule:Eſech. 10 Veſtiui te diſcoloribus. I haue clothed
the with a garmente of dyuers colours: But in
eſpeciall there be two colours / that is white and
purpull:Pro. 30 as hit is wryten: Biſſus et purpura indumentum
eius. And as purpull ſheweth well vpon
white: ſo charite becometh well an inocent and
a deuoute perſon. This garment is made and
wouon with the threde of grace / and of the holy
gooſte. It is made alſo of the inwarde partes of
our lorde Ieſu Chriſte: hit was dyed purpull at
the tyme of his holy paſſion: by the whiche paſſion
he ſhewed manyfeſtly howe feruently he loued
vs. And therfore al we be boūde to loue hym
agayne as moche as is poſſyble: and to lyghte
our fyre / that is our loue at the furnace of his ſingular
loue. Charite is compared to fyre / as our
ſauiour ſayth in the holy goſpell:Luc. 12 Ignem veni mi
                  •
               
               tere in terram: And that is for many propreties / whiche
are aſcryued to the fyre. Fyrſte and formoſte

/ fyre is the moſte vertuous of all elementes:
and charite in effecte is aboue all vertues.
The fyre burneth & gyueth lyght: Charite burneth
by ſwete affection / and it gyueth lyght by
good examples. The fire kēdeleth the deed cole / and
mollyfyeth the harde and colde yron: Charite
dryueth awaye from man the colde of couetouſneſſe / and
cauſeth the ſoule (the whiche by
reaſon of ſynne is deed) to reuiue. Fyre turneth
all thynge to aſſhes: and Charite (by reaſon of
humiltie) cauſeth man to repute hym ſelfe vile / and
but aſſhes. Fyre naturallye euer more aſendeth
vpwarde: Charite is euer more occupyed
doynge good warkes. Fyer taketh away the ruſtynes
of yron: Charite ſkoureth away the ruſt
and fylthynes of ſynne. The fiere caſteth ſparkels:
Charite caſteth vppe heuenly deſire. The
fyre maketh the potte to boyle and defēdeth the
potte from flyes: Charite cauſeth the harte of
man to boyle in deuocion / and kepeth hit from
the dyuels / and all other temptacions. Fyer defendeth
/ that the fletermouſe drynketh nat the
oyle out of the lampe: Charite defendeth / that
our goſtly ennemie drynke nat from vs the gracious
oyle of the holy gooſte / beynge in the hart
of man / whiche is called the lampe of our ſoule.
In this Cote armour is liuerie. In this gowne
of maryage muſt be peynted the kynges armes
vnder whoſe ſtanderd we warre / that is the armes
of our lorde Ieſus. It his than neceſſary

that we paynte with letters of aſure in the fore
parte of this armour a croſſe / and the name Ieſus:
That is bycauſe we oughte contynually to
haue in memorie the innumerable benefyttes / that
god hath done for vs. And on the backe ſide
therof we muſte do peynte Chriſtus, that we may
beare in remembraunce / howe Chriſte with his
precious bloud bought / redemed / and ſaued vs.
         
         
            Of the Horſe. The .xii. Chap.
            ANd whan we haue all the foreſayde
harneis / and ther vpon this goodly
Cote armour / than are we redy to aſſaute the
cite of Paradiſe / whiche muſte be conqueredde
par force:Matt. xi. Regnum celorum vim patitur. And ſo we
ſhall be ſtronge and myghty to reſyſte all our ennemyes
that wolde hurte or withſtande vs.
            But yet there is no other thynge. Truely hit is
nat mete that a knight armed ſhulde go on fote:
wherfore he muſt nedes haue a hardy / a ſwefte
a ſtronge and a well tournynge horſe. His horſe
may nat be heuy / drawynge backe / or fearefull.
This horſe is lykened to mās body: the whiche
in ſtede of a horſe we muſte nedes vſe. Whiche
alſo oughte to be whyte / by clenlynes and pure
Chaſtite.The .iiii. horſe ſhoos. Farder more he muſte be ſhodde with
foure ſhowes / that is with the foure pryncipall
affections: whiche be called / loue / heuyneſſe / hope
and drede: the whiche muſte be ruled and

ordered after goddis commaundementes: For
other wyſe they be fautye / and nat ſurely ſet on
as good horſe ſhowes oughte to be.The horſe ſaddyll. This horſe
ſaddyll is called the knowlege of mans fragilite / and
ſickenes / where vnto mans nature is ſubiecte.
Farther more hit is to be knowen / that a
knyght ſhall neuer ryde ſurely / except he knowe
all his horſes conditions: So like wiſe the ſoule
ſhall neuer gouerne well the bodye / excepte hit
knowe his diſeaſe / his complection / his ſtrēgth / and
his condicions. This ſaddyll muſt be ſtraitly
bounde and gyrded with the gyrthe of examinacion
of conſcyence:The 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                orelles the ſaddyll maye
tourne / and cauſe his maiſter to falle. The poytrell
of this horſe betokeneth the remembrance
of dethe / and knowlege of the vilany and filthyneſſe
of the body.The poytrell. The croper ſygnifyeth confeſſion
of our ſinnes.The crop. For as the horſe auoideth his
dounge and fylthyneſſe behynde: So the ſoule
by great humylite and deuoute confeſſion auoydeth
her ſynne. And as the poytrell and the croper
kepe the ſadyll faſte vpon the horſe from fallynge:
So in lyke maner the remembrauuce of
dethe / and humble confeſſion of ſynne / makethe
a man to knowe hym ſelfe.The fyrſte ſteroppe. The fyrſte ſteroppe
is humylitie in proſperitie / the whiche by continuaunce
is longe ynough: For it is great peyne
to ryde with ſhorte ſteroppes: and ſo lyke wyſe / if
we do nat contynue in goodnes / all that we do
is naught / and to none effecte.The ſecōd ſteroppe. The ſeconde ſteroppe

is pacience in aduerſytie: whiche is very
neceſſarye to holde faſte mans ſoule vpon the ſadyll
/ from fallynge or tournynge. Of this pacience
ſaynt Paule ſaythe: Patientia enim vobis neceſſaria
eſt. Hit is conuenyent alſo that this horſe
be brydled / and ſo to leade hym at our pleaſure:Heb. 10
that is to ſay / we muſte nedes chaſtiſe our body:
that it rebelle nat agaynſte the ſoule. We muſte
alſo take hede / that this horſe ouerthrowe nat
his mayſter: that is that the body diſtroye nat
the ſoule: bearynge awaye the ſoule as hym luſteth
to corporall pleſures and voluptyes. But
yet we muſte nat ſo rigorouſly and with ſo great
peyne vſe hit / that hit ſhulde nat be able to go.
Therfore hit is conuenyent to leade hym by the
rayne of Diſcrecion. For diſcrecion is a vertue / the
whiche without fautynge leadeth a man to
the ryghte waye / inclynynge or wauerynge no
more on the one ſyde than on the nother / but kepynge
hit ſelfe well / gothe fourthe ſtyll on in the
kynges hygh waye: whiche is bothe vertuous
and alſo profitable. Whan this horſe is trapped
apparayled and garnyſhed after the maner afore
ſayde: we muſte moūte and leape vp vpon
his backe / and ſo lerne to gide and gouerne hym
with the brydell of wyſedome and rayne of diſcrecion
/ that is to knowe the redy waye whiche
we ought to kepe / and the pathes that leade vs
to the Cite of Paradiſe.
         
         
            
            Of the ſpourres. The .xiii. Chap.
            BVter we begynne to lerne and to
leade this horſe / it is neceſſary we put on
our gylte ſpourres / to quycken hym / if he be to
ſlowe / to full of praunſynge / or to fyerce. One of
the ſpourres is called eſperance / and hope of the
glorye and felycite / that they ſhall haue / whiche
in this worlde do penance for theyr ſynnes. The
other ſpoure is called feare of damnacion. It is
alſo very neceſſary that theſe ſpoures be gylted:
For what ſo euer we do / it muſte be done for goddis
ſake. And that this ſeruyable feare tourne
hym ſelfe to chyldyſſhe feare: and that is whan
men ſpecially forbeare to do yll / for drede leſte by
theyr myſdedes / they ſhulde prouoke the wrath
of god. And ſo like wyſe of hope. Vnder this maner
afore ſayde / theſe ſpoures muſte be gylted:
and ſo they ſhall cauſe our horſe to be hardy / quiuer
/ lyght / and redy at wyll. Nowe than let vs
ryde and ſo handell our ſelfe / that our ſoule be alwayes
mayſter. Let vs alſo laye ſiege to the cite
of Paradiſe. But aboue all other prouyſion hit
is very nedefull / that we carye vitayle with vs:
orels we may famyſſhe and dye for lacke of ſuſtinaunce.
We muſte nedes haue breadde: For we
haue yet a lōge iourney to go: as the angell ſaid
to the prophet Helie: Grandis enim tibi reſtat via.
And what thynge ſhal this breadde be? Truely
the worde of god: with the whiche the ſoule of

man is made ſatte / as Dauid ſaythe: Sicut adipe
et pinguedine repleatur anima mea.Pſal. lxii Pſal. Liii. And agayne:
Panis cor hominis confirmet. Breadde comforteth
mans harte: and the worde of god doth comfort
and cauſeth mannes ſoule to lyue: and with out
this breadde no man may lyue longe. Therfore
our lorde ſayth:Luc. 4. Non in ſolo pane viuit homo. A man
lyueth nat onely by breadde / but by the worde
that procedeth from the mouthe of god. Saynt
Auguſtine ſaythe: As mans fleſſhe is after he
hath faſted / ſo is the ſoule that is nat fedde contynually
with the worde of god. Lette vs than
take this breadde and beare hit with vs in our
mawe / or in the bynne of our harte and memorie
hangynge from our necke / and deſcendynge
to the ſide of our harte: that is / that we haue alwayes
the worde of god in our mouthe & harte / ſwetely
chawynge hit: and we ſhall fynde therin
great comforte and great ſweteneſſe. Let vs
alſo carye wyne with vs / that we maye therby
more comforttably and meryly ſuffre the payne
of ſo longe a iourney. This wyne is called ſpirituall
ioye / and wytneſſe of good conſcience: whiche
alway reioyſeth mans hart. Of the whiche
wyne Dauid ſaythe: Et vinum letificet cor hominis.Pſal. Liii.
Whan we haue all the foreſayde thynges / than
maye we ſtoutely walke Vſ
                  
                     
                  
                  que
                ad montem dei Jacob,
vnto the cite of Hieruſalem / that is to Paradiſe.
But nowe what way ſhall we take / that we erre
nat in our iourney? Truely the waye of goddis

cōmaundementes: Of the whiche Dauid ſpeaketh:pſal. 11
                     •
                  
               
Viam mandatorum tuorum cucutti, quum dilataſti
cor meum. O lorde god (ſaythe Dauid) I ronne
by the way of thy cōmaūdementes / after that yu
haddeſt enlarged myn harte with thy loue and
charite. Theſe wayes be goodly and honeſt / as
we rede in the boke of wiſedome:pro. 3 Die ems vie pulchre.
But yet for all that the bie pathes (though
they be ſtrayter) be more peſible / & moche more
ſhorter. Theſe bye pathes be called the counſayles
of the holy goſpell: as to kepe virginite / to
forſake the worlde / and all other erthly thinges / as
to moche affection and loue of our frendes / with
other like / the whiche religious men ſhuld
kepe / that they myght ſo the ſoner come to this
cite of Paradiſe: and alſo to auoyde the daūger
of theues / whiche moſte cōmonly lye lurkynge
by the hyghe wayes ſyde. Of theſe bye pathes
and fote pathes ſpeaketh the wyſe man: Etomnes
ſemite eius pacifice:Pr
                     •
                  . 3 Let vs therfore go and ride
haſtyly as longe as hit is daye / leſte the nyghte
come ſodaynly vpon vs / that is leſte dethe come
ſodaynly vpon vs: for than we can go no more.
Therfore our lorde ſayde to his diſciples: Ambulate,
dum lucem habetis, ne tenebre vos comprehendant.Io. 1
                     •
                  
               
Go you (ſaythe our lorde) as longe as ye haue
lyght / leſte the darkenes of dethe come ſodaynly
vpon you. Therfore lette vs walke whyle we
haue ſpace / and lette vs ronne / nat with the fote
of our body / but of the ſoule / by holy deſires and

good affections: And whan we come nere vnto
the cite / lette vs laye ſiege there vnto / coueringe
vs with our tētes and pauilions: that is to ſay / with
good examples of holy ſayntes: Conſyderynge
/ howe they in tyme paſte beſieged and cō
               quered
this cite by force and violence / enduringe
great payne and labour: and at the laſte by the
vertue of good & ſtedfaſt faythe / they ouercame
all paynes and labours: as ſaynt Paule ſayth / wrytynge
to the Hebrewes:Heb. 11 Sancti per fidem vicerunt
regna. Let vs than beſiege this cite / and let
vs aſſaulte it on euery ſide / and ſpecially on that
ſyde / on whiche we thynke ſooneſte to gette hit.
This cite hath .xii. gates / of the whiche .xii. gates
/ the .xii. apoſtels / the .xii. patriarkes / and
the .xii. prophettes be porters. At euery gate be
iii. porters in the name of the trinite. There be
turrettes and dwellynge places innumerable:
Quia multe manſiones in celo.Io. 14 There be in Paradiſe
very many dwellynge places / meete for euerye
man after theyr merite. And therfore let vs take
counſayle / on whiche ſyde we ſhall aſſayle this
cite. Me thynketh we ſhall ſooneſt come in it we
caſte and ſhoote our dartes / arowes / and gounnes
agaynſte the great to wre and place of this
cite / wherin the kynge and the quene dwell / that
is our ſwete lorde Ieſus / and Mary his ſwete
mother. Agaynſt this towre we muſt caſt ſo many
ſyghes / compunctions of harte / teares / and
deuoute prayers / that we may fynde ſome entre

in to this cite: and perceyue by ſome felynge of
deuotion gyuen vs by god / that our ſyghes and
prayers be harde: If we can nat gette in to the
cite at our pleaſure: yet for all that lette vs nat
breake vp our ſiege / but contynue hit ſtyll / cryynge:
Vpon them / vpon them. And lette vs go
continually from one gate to an other / vntyll we
maye fynde ſome entre: that is to ſaye / Let vs
praye / nowe to one ſaynte / nowe to an other / as
our deuocion wyll ſerue vs. But before all other
and pryncipally lette vs praye deuoutely to our
bleſſed lady / quene of this cite / mother of mercy
and of all pite: For ſhe is ſo gentyl and ſo kynde / that
ſhe wylle nat hyde her from vs / but wyll open
to vs the gates of this cite / thoughe ſhe had
yet leauer that we ſhulde contynue euer more in
vertue / good lyfe / and deuoute prayere. But if
ſhe or any other prolonge the matter / let vs ſcale
the walles with the ladder of Contemplacion / and
let vs ſette vp this ladder of contemplacion
iuſte to the walles / that is conſidrynge god and
ſuche heuenly and worldly thynges as maye be
ſene & conſydred by man. For why / by the knowlege
of viſyble thynges / we maye comme to the
knowlege of diuine and inuyſyble thynges / as
ſaynt Paule ſaythe:Ro. 1 Inuiſibilia enim dei a creatura
mundi, per eq que facta ſunt, intellecta conſpiciuntur.
And if they ouerthrowe vs frō this ladder (for
we can nat remayne longe vpon hit / bycauſe of
the weyght of our body / whiche alway anoyeth

and hurteth the ſoule / nat ſuffrynge it to lyfte it
ſelfe vpwarde to god / whiche thynge mannes
ſoule naturally deſyreth to do / as the wyſe man
ſaythe:Sa. ix. Corpus, quod corrumpitur, aggrauat animā. &c.
Yet for all that / let vs nat gyue ouer and depart
from our ſiege / but let vs manly and ſo aſſaute
this cite on ſome ſyde / whether it be by ſhotinge
of gounnes or ſerpentynes agaynſt thoſe gates
and towres / that throughe breakynge and bruſynge
of them / they maye gyue eare to our prayers
and requeſtis: and farther more open theyr
gates to vs / by compaſſyon and pyte: and that
we may parceyue and fele by deuotion that they
haue holpen vs: for than the cite ſhalbe taken.
And we muſt crye: To ye aſſaulte good felowes / to
the aſſaulte: Vpon them / vpon them. God
ſaue kinge Ieſus / god ſaue kynge Ieſus. After
all this let vs take priſoners: one / one ſaynt: an
other / an other / orels many of them after as we
fynde our myndes inflamed with deuocion / to
take one / or to take many. For who that hath
moſte pryſoners ſhall be moſte ryche. And than
we muſte fylle and replenyſſhe our bagges and
ſackes with ſpoylynges: that is to ſay / our deſires
and hartes with dyuers gyftes of the holy
gooſte / and with dyuers vertues and graces:
from ſome one the vertue of humylyte / frō ſome
other Charite: and ſo forthe of other / vntyll our
ſackes be fylled vp. And we enryched muſt take
hede / that we brynge with vs no ſmalle ſackes.

why / after oure deſyre and deuocion / we ſhall
brynge from thence grace / gyftes / indulgence / and
pardone. Nor we muſte nat meruayle / nor
yet gyue ouer the ſiege of this cite / thoughe we
be ſome tyme wounded and beaten backe: For
as it is a great preyſe and honour for a knyght / to
be wounded and ſuffre many a ſtroke / for the
loue of his prynce and mayſter: So in lyke maner
hit is great honoure to vs / to ſuffre greatte
payne / and to be greuouſly wounded for goddis
ſake / and for his loue to endure great laboure / great
penance / and temtacion. For if we contynue
in this batayle and aſſaulte vntyll we dye / we
ſhall be greatly rewarded / and ſhall haue a
crowne of victory: whiche of duty muſte be gyuen
vnto them / that manly / and ſtrongly / haue
foughten in this paynefulle lyfe for goddis ſake.
For why / as Iob ſayth:Iob. vii Militia eſt vita hominis ſuper
terram. The life of man in this worlde is none
other thynge but a continuall warfare agaynſt
the pryncis of darkeneſſe: whiche be the fendes
of helle: and theyr ſoudyours / ye whiche are the
worlde and the fleſſhe / with vnlauful and vnhoneſt
deſyre: the whiche bothe nyght and day laboure
to diſtroye and ouer come vs. And alſo to
brynge vs out of the hyghe waye / that leadeth
men to heuen. If we maye ouer come theſe our
ennemies / we ſhall be crowned / as our lorde god
ſayth in the Apocalypſe:Apot. 
                     •
                  
                Vincenti, inquit, dabo edete
de ligno vite, quod eſt in paradiſo dei mei. He that

getteth the victorye (ſaythe our lorde) ſhall eate
of the tree of lyfe / whiche is in Paradiſe: and in
the glorie of god my father. The whiche thynge
graunte vs the father / the ſonne / and the holy
goſte. Amen.
