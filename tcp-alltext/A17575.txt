                for suffering such evils as are dayly incident to all men, as they are men, how we are disposed to take up the crosse of Christ, and to beate that other sort of afflictions, that are proper to Christians, as they are professors of the Gospel: for albeit that all vices doe crie in our eares, that we be woful creatures, subjected through sinne to manie miseries; albeit the lamentable example of others set the same lesson manie a time before our eyes, & albeit we doe often feele the sparkles of the fire upon our own bodies, and may knowe the warning peeces before the Lords great ordnance, yet when tribulation commeth within our doores, we think it almost as strange, and intertaine it as impatiently, as if it had never knocked, nor giuen a warning before: the loue of the world, &

the secure fruition of present prosperitie naturally so filling the heart, that it leaveth no roome for the expectation of adversitie. We may finde upon greater reason the like untoward disposition of heart, when we are called to suffer for the profession of the gospell: for we haue been taught from the beginning, that all that will liue godlie in Iesus Christ must suffer persecution, that the godlie shall weepe, and lament, but the world shall rejoyce; often hath it been beaten in our eares, that we would ere long be put to our triall; We might also by the light of the fires of affliction in other Kirks beside us, haue discovered our owne dangers, and prepared our selues against them; and which is more, and draweth nearer, in the tryall begunne, and continued at home amongst our selues, we might haue beholden the common case, and condition of us all; yet no sooner are we assayed a new againe with the smallest threatnings, but we are put to such perplexitie, as if eyther we of all Christians were excepted from affliction, and to us onely Christ should be a Saviour without a crosse, or els that for fear of the losse of some worldly dignitie, or temporal commoditie, we should so much as enter in deliberation whether to change anie part of our holy, and comfortable profession.

And when yee haue changed the comfortable worship of God with husks, & emptie ceremonies that nourish not, either yee shal with remorse returne to eat bread, in the old maner in your fathers house, or els yee shall dolefully goe on from evil to worse, your consciences, which yee haue greeved, perpetually tormenting you, and the one fide whom ye haue hardened, crying out upon your olde hypocrisie, and the other side whome yee haue deserted, upon your new apostasie. That, vvhich your conscience would not suffer you to doe, for any pretended church authoritie, for all the arguments, & reasons that haue been multiplied, and for the doctrine and example of your own pastors, if yee shall now through feare

of anie worldly losse suddainly admit, what shall al these, who have been your witnesses from the beginning of this controversie judge, but that yee are a multitude of wilful worldlings; that yee haue in your prosperitie counterfeited the voice, and caried the opinion of good Christians, as the parrat can learne to imitate the voice of man; but now when yee are beaten with the parrat, yee returne to your own voice, and manifestly declare of what kinde you are.

                unto you, which is the scope of the worldlings text, Ioh. 11. 48. If we let him alone the Romans shall come, and take awaie both our place, and our nation; if yee adhere to the reformation, & retain Christ, as you haue learned him; both Session, and counsell will be removed, and your towne will turne to nothing. Remember that which was once taught you upon that place, by your owne holie, and heauenly preacher M. Rollock in his powerfull manner. That the wisedome of the world looketh to the present estate, and condition of things; if with it Christ, and the puritie of religion may subsist, then will they embrace Christ, & religion, otherwise they bidde them farewell. But the wisedome of God (saith he) layeth Christ, and the puritie of Christian religion for a

ground, and sinne closeth her eyes to all events whatsoever for Christ, and religion should not be servants to policie, but policie, and this whole world should serue Christ, and religion. The Iewes preferring their estate to Christ, and fearing ruine, if Christ should liue, they kill him to saue their nation, but the same was the cause, that in the justice of God the Romans came, and destroyed their nation. The Lord hath moe waies then your town hath ports, to bring in his wrath, and for magnifying his owne wisedom, and snaring of men in their wisedome, manie times judgment entereth by the port, that pollicie hath locked fastest. They wanted not in those daies their owne pretexts, none of them was so shamelesse, as to set himself against God, as God, they had their owne cunning to colour the matter, and pulled forth their eyes least they should see, that God, against whom they fought, as men deale now with Christ, and the puritie of religion. The more knowledge, and the lesse conscience we finde in anie age, we may look for the fouler errors, and the fairer covers. Oppose also to that the Christians text Matth. 16. 26. and with elevation of heart think seriously, what hath a man profited, if he should gaine the whole world, and lose his owne soule? or what can

a man giue in exchange for his soule? 1. the immortal soule of man may be losed. 2. the gaining of the world is the ordinarie cause of the losse of the soule. 3. it is extreame follie to loose the soule for gaining of the world: for first it is an unprofitable gaine, what hath a man profited? and next it is an unreparable losse, what can a man giue in exchange for his soule, so that the losse of one soule, is the eternall losse of that which is more worth then the whole world. 4. he maketh themselues judges, and demandeth them for their farther conviction. But in this lieth the deceit, that while men to their own conviction acknowledge it to be madnesse to loose their soules for the world, they obserue not, or will not suffer themselues to obserue the secret, but sure conjunction betwixt the sinful courses they betake them selues to for gaining the world, and betwixt the losse of their soules. Purge your affections of this particular feare, and quit your selues of such things, as woe your flesh, and court your carnal senses: Covetousnes is the roote of all evil, ease savoureth not the things that be of God, but those that be of men, and whosoever shall be ashamed of Christ and his words in this adulterous, and sinfull generation, of him also shall the Sonne of man be ashamed

when he cometh in the glorie of his father with his holie angels.
            Thirdly, when yee haue happilie removed the world, and all worldlie tentations God blesseth not a worship not directed by his word. from betwixt your eye & the cause in hand; for your resolution yee neede not to search after curiosities of learning, nor wander after uncertainties of opinions; but limitting and directing your sight, 1 Looke first upward to the glorious majestie of God, who is present at his owne worship, & neither accepteth, nor blesseth a worship, that is not directed by his own word: thinke as in his sight, whether yee may looke for a more sensible testification of his comfortable presence in your soules at the celebration of the Lords supper, when ye draw neerest to Christs institution, or when Christs gesture of sitting is abolished as common, & profane, & the Antichrists gesture of kneeling is enforced as more humble and holy; the table of the Lord either taken away or turned into a cupboord, our eating & drinking into a minsed and pinched tasting, our conjunct communicating into a confused disputation, our sacramental breaking in the time of the action into a formal carving before the action, our kindly, and christian distribution into a steward like dispensation, the enunciatiue words of the institution, into

an idle petition and repetition, and our spirituall exhortations according to Christs example into a comfortlesse deadnes, & silence. Such Churches, as never saw better, may haue some comfort in this, but for you who haue seene the glorie of the first temple in this land, and who call to minde with what heauenly meditation, liuelie affection, large consolation, and with what spirituall resolution yee were wonte to be filled; It is a wonder, when yee see this new ministration with your eyes, that your hearts melt not within you, that your flesh crieth not out for the living God, that yee weepe not with a louder voice then the voice of their joy, who shoute now having gotten the arke of the Lord upon a cart, that ye prefer not the poorest parish in the land with the libertie of Christs institution, to your owne tabernacles and courts, that of late were so amiable, that your soules longed, and fainted for them.
            2 Looke back, and see how the house of God was builded, and the headstone put Building, & demolishing of the house of God compared together. upon it by Gods owne hand to the admiration of the christian world about us; what unitie of ministers, authoritie of assemblies, order of ministrie, puritie of external, power of internall worship, what zeale, and indignation against all impietie, and iniquitie.

And againe by what methods, and machinations haue succeeded, for unitie, division, for authority anarchie, for order hierarchy, for puritie of worship antichristian ceremonies, for power of godlines superstition & profanitie, and for zeale, and indignation, nothing but lukewarmnes, and toleration. In all these considerations, as this nationall kirk was eminent aboue other nations, so were yee aboue us all, as farre as in civill dignitie. And shall we liue to see the day, when for the confused feare of an uncertaine losse, our Ierusalem shall become Romish, our Philadelphia become Laodicea, our fountain be turned into a puddle, our glorie become our shame, our Najoth, our beautie turn to be our blemish, our lothing, our deformitie.
            Looke back also to the course of his blessings upon our reformation, & the perpetual The blessings upon the reformation, & judgements upon defection compared together. course of his judgments upō our defection. We know the power of the Lords particular providence in al the works under the sunne, & should haue learned against the atheisme of the times to haue referred notable judgments to their own procuring causes. The darknes, lightning, thunder, haile & rain at the ratificatiō of these rites that now molest us; the inundations, the hunger, and cold, the sicknesses and death, since can

not yet be worn out of our senses, & shal be kept in memory by the generations after us.
            Looke again back, & compare the many reverend assemblies, which we haue kept The former assemblies compared with Perth assemblie. with that one new meeting at Perth, & trie the spirits. The place of the 95 Psal. is impertinent, neither can it be a commandement, for at sometimes it is not lawfull to kneele before him, & no man wil say, that we are commanded so oft, as we worship, to kneel. The second, and third reasons in the act, beside other absurdities, do charge the Lord Iesus Christ with his disciples, & al the kirks that haue used Christs gesture after him with an unreverent behaviour in a holy action. And whether the memorie of by past, or the multiplicatiō of present superstition, (which is the fourth pretence in the act) might not haue giuen a better narratiue for the contrarie conclusion, the times haue given verdict.
            3 Looke inwards into your owne heart, that you may finde the testimonie of a good A good cō
                  science maketh choise of the sure
                     ••
                   way. conscience, one sure note whereof, is this, that in cases cōtroverted a good conscience taketh ever the surest, and safest side. Perjurie is a hainous sin, & odious to the world. Idolatrie is against the first commandements of the first table, & is no lesse abominable in the sight of the alseeing jealous God

then is adulterie to a jealous husband, whē it is committed before his eyes. Now it is known to us all, that in our confessions and covenants we haue abjured al Antichrist his rites, and ceremonies added to the ministration of the true sacraments without the word of God (of the which sort, this kneeling was esteemed to be one, and cannot escape this censure more then other popish rites) & it is as certaine, that all the fetches, and fingers that haue beene busied about this knot haue not loosed it. Kneeling also before the elements is proved to be Idolatrie, not onely in that sense, that a glance of the eye, or a gesture, and a rash word of anger, are adulterie, and murther by Christs owne interpretation, but also being taken, as it is commanded in the act; both because it is kneeling with direction before a creature, and that it is done in reverence of the sacrament. The greatest clarkes among our opposites can giue no other answers, nor differences betwixt this kneeling, & the worship of images, but that the one is somewhat inhaesivè in objecto, or adhaesivè per objectum, but the other is abstractivè ab obiecto, and that the sacrament is obiectum a quo significativè, which darke distinctions, and subtile evasions can be conceived but of a few, neither can these few finde in them anie satisfaction.

But upon the other side Christs gesture of sitting at the communion is free of the fear of both these rocks. And therefore while the superstitious conscience will be pleased with the appearance of humilitie, and the servile conscience wil follow example and authoritie, and the blinde conscience swalloweth downe bunchbacked camels, and gnats, counting all under indifferencie, and the bould conscience will venture with sacrificing Saul stoutelie, & the presumptuous conscience will take leaue for worldly respects, and say, in this the Lord be merciful unto me; In the meane time the good conscience labouring to keepe integritie, will take the safest, and surest course for her constant tranquilitie, that she neither be guiltie of perjurie nor Idolatrie.
            4 Looke forward, and yee shall see the A litle chāge openeth the doore to traditions, and the substance of poperie. wide doore of traditions cast open, whereby the whole multitude, & theatrical pompe not onely of English, but popish rites, woodbind to the gospell may as well enter, when authoritie biddeth them, as these called innocent ceremonies. And when we haue received the shadow, what can we looke for lesse then for the substance, for which some are secretly as busie, as others openly are for ceremonies. The divil hath put the warpe of defection long since upon

his beame amongst us, he will not let it out of his loome, but wil still employ one malignant witt after another to make it out. And the Lord in his justice may plague preceeding defections with following apostasie, whatsoever be the intention of the present urgers.
            Looke forward, what shal be the case of the posteritie, and of your owne children, A care is to be had of the posteritie. whether they shall haue cause to curse their predecessors, that resisted not the beginnings of evil, and who were more careful of their civil then of their spiritual liberties. Their hearts shall mourne, and the tear manie a time shall fal into their eye, when they shall behold so fair a building, so deerely conquessed, so firmlie grounded, so compactly builded, so wel lighted, so wholesome to dwel in, so meet for God, and his Angels to delite in, so fruitfull a paradice as this kirke was, wherein they should haue succeeded, to be pitifullie ruined by their fathers, possessed by their enemies, and made a denne of uncleane spirits.

everlasting destructiō from the presence of the Lord, and the glorie of his power, and to be glorified in his Saincts, & to be admired in all them that beleeue. In these three greatest terrours, what joy of heart shal it be unto you? that God by his singular care, not for your merits aboue others, that fall, but to make you examples of his grace, hath kept you in so dangerous dayes from the streā of defection; that he hath made you to shine as the stars in heauen, whē others like the sand of the sea shore haue been covered with the inundations of the time. So manie of you, as haue seen better times haue not now long to liue, your eye is upon the marke, yee are almost at the ende of your race, and the crowne is readie for you, and shall yee turne your back upon God, leaue that course, whereby yee haue all your assurance, and comfort of salvation, and returne now to the garlick, and onyons of Egypt, when yee are so neere to the promised Canaan.

If ye looke to Mockers, resolue with Iob. 17. 6. to be made a by word of the people, & as it were a tabret. for eyther thou must be a mocker with Ismael, or sustaine mockings, & derisions with Isaack. If ye looke to them who suffer in other places, their trials are fierie, & they haue suffered to the bloud, yours are but earthen, or airie, & ye haue not yet suffered with joy the spoyling of your goods. If ye looke to papists; and adversaries, harden them not; & most of al, when ye looke upon weake professors, giue them no offence, neither doe that which is scandalous, or may be unto them a stumbling block. Neither your inward intention, nor the outward commandement of the magistrate wil remoue the moral, perpetual, and universal reason, that is giuen by the Apostle without anie exception, Destroy not him, for whom Christ died. Neither your good meaning, nor civill authoritie, will make it cease to be scandall, nor cease to be sin, nor cease to be your sinne. And thus except ye blind your eyes wilfully, and put away a good

conscience, looke whether ye will, whether upward, or back, or inward, or forward, or about you, all cal you to be readie upon the watch word to suffer, al promise you joy, & comfort in your sufferings. Let the brambles of the wood that can doe noe better rule over the trees of the forest; continue ye still like the oliue, the fig tree, the vine; loose not your fatnes, your sweetnes, your cheerefulnes for the fattest, the sweetest, and most pleasant preferments.

If you shall be wearie now, or make defection; all your former testification will be a direct accusation against your selues. Pilate protested thrice that he found no fault in Christ, & laboured to set him free; but least he be reputed a smal friend to Caesar, at last he delivered him to be crucified. Darius laboured all the day til the setting of the sunne to deliver Daniel, but overcome with importunitie, he condemneth him at last to the lyons denne; which made him to passe that night without meat, sleep, or musicke. Your reasons, and motiues that ye stood upon before, doe yet stand without change in the power of your consciences,

and therefore drawe not upon your selues after so long a day, a restles night of doole, and desolation.

Think not that his gracious majestie hath quite forgotten what he was once himself, or that he will not pittie his owne woonted case in your persons now, as Augustine did the Manichęans, greater Hereticks, then we are imagined to be. Illi in vos saeuiant, qui nullo tali errore decepti sunt, quali vos deceptos vident, ego autem saeuire in vos omnino non possum, quos sicut meipsum illo tempore, ita nunc debeo sustinere, & tanta patientia vobiscum agere, quanta mecum egerunt proximi mei. His Majestie will not refuse at your hands the offer that Ierusalē made to Alexander. They could not suffer his image to be erected in their temple, but they were readie to please him in everie thing wherein God was not displeased, as to begin the accounts of their times from his entrie to the towne, and to giue him the name of all their first borne sonnes. If you shall offer, what is Caesars, and what is yours, he can not offend that yee keepe Christs royall prerogatiue to himself. He was not a defender, but a persecuter of the faith (whom for respect to our Dread Soveraine we will not name).

who inserted the images of the false gods into his owne picture, that no man could adore the Emperour, and not adore them, and if anie refused they were punished, as guiltie of laesae majestatis. We looke never to see your civil obedience, and the practise of Idolatrous ceremonies so straitlie joyned, neither in his majesties opinion, nor in his injunctions to his good people.
            Neither can your Ministers forget themselues so farre, as to set themselues to be instruments to draw the wrath of a King upon their owne flock. If they were justly offended, they woulde rather send up their The dutie

            Other Kirks abroad which haue not beene favoured with your measure of reformation

haue been exercised with their own trials, but never had the happie occasion to giue you example of suffering. The Lord hath been more liberal to us, & requireth of us that we giue example, & encouragement to them to aspire to our perfection. We all suffer in the same cause of Christ, some for his person, some for his priesthood, & some for his princely office. If we looke to the enimies, and not to the equitie of the cause, there is great inequalitie of sufferings, yet the promise of blessednes is pronounced upon them, who suffer in the last times by Christians, no lesse then to them, who in the primitiue times were persecuted by the heathen. Were the question now of the profession of the name of Christ, manie say they would be martyrs, who now are persecuters: but the question would be, whether conscience, or credite were their cause. In matters of this sort, that we are about, especially where the discredite, and scoffing of the world waiteth on, conscience may be the more sensiblie discerned; and the lesse the cause be, providing it be Christs cause, the more acceptable to God, & the more comfortable to thy self is thy suffering. If by no meanes, when all are assaied with God and the King, and your pastors, you can decline the crosse; but if the will of God be that ye

suffer; then denie, and lay aside your selues, take on the erosse, and follow Christ, applying joyfully to your soules al the cōforts that the word furnisheth in afliction, whether the Lords rich promises, or the sweet fruits of the crosse, or the weakenes of the enemies, or the greatnes of the reward, or the example of the prophets, apostles, confessors, and martyrs, or which is most, conformitie with Christ, whose we are, and in whom we continue.
