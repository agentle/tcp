               ❧A Proclamation signifying the Kings Maiesties pleasure, touching the resort of people to his Coronation.
            
               
                  FOrasmuch as wee finde that the Infection within our Citie of London doeth dayly increase, and is like (to our griefe) rather to augment then diminish, aswel by reason of the season of the yeere, as by the great Concourse of people to our sayd City against the time of our Coronation, some to do their dueties in such necessary seruices, as to them belongeth at that Solemnitie, and some for comfort they take in the sight of our Person, of the Queene our deare wife, and of our children; Although there could be no greater ioy to vs then the presence and confluence of all sorts of good Subiects at such a time, when the more there should be partakers of that publique reioycing, the more should bee our Particular comfort: yet such is our feare least this their resort should worke a contrary effect both to their and our expectation, namely to bee a meanes not onely of increasing the Infection within our Citie, but of dispersing it into all places of this Realme, as wee had rather forbeare some part of our Ornament and Custome, which is due to the Honour and Solemnitie of our Coronation, then by hauing the vttermost thereof perfourmed, bee the occasion of so great an euill to our people, as is the spreading of the Infection amongst them,
            Wherefore we haue thought it best to forbeare of that Solemnitie, whatsoeuer is not Essentiall to it, and to deferre all shewe of State and Pompe accustomed by our Progenitors, which is not of necessitie to be done within the Church at the time of our Coronation, As also to omit our Solemne entry and passage through our Citie of London for this time, intending to performe the same hereafter in the Winter, when we shall perceiue our Citie to be free from sickenesse. And of this our purpose and of the causes thereof, we haue thought good to giue notice to all our Subiects by Proclamation, To the end that aswell those of our sayd City may forbeare to proceede in such Shewes and Ornaments, as we heare they out of their loue haue in hand to honour our sayd entry, As also all other people may abstaine from resorting to our sayd City at this time, other then such, as haue necessary Employment in that Solemnity, and chiefely about such parts thereof as are to be performed onely within the Church: whom also we require to bring with them no greater traine of seruants, then of necessitie they must vse each of them in his degree about their persons; Wherein they shall both prouide for their owne good, and giue vs great satisfaction in conforming themselues dutifully to this our Admonition.
            
               
                  Giuen at our Castle of Windsor,
                  
                     the sixt day of Iuly, 1603. in the first yeere of our Reigne of England, France and Ireland, and of Scotland, the sixe and thirtieth.
                  
               
God saue the King.
