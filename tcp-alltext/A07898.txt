            TO THE MOST REVEREND FA
               ther, my very good Lord, Richard by Gods holy ordinance the Lord Arch-bishop of Canterburie his grace, primate and metropolitane of all Eng
               land, grace and peace from God the father, and from our Lord Iesus Christ.
            
            
               AS many things (most reuerend father,) are both comely and profitable; so neither is there, neither can there be anything more necessarie, in any well managed church or christian common weale, then godly vniformitie and christian vnitie in pure Religion, the proper and peculiar worship of the euerliuing God. Which vnitie and vniforme conformitie for all that, not onely the cruell and blood-thristie Papists in former times, but the Brownists also and the Martinists, (cursed broodes untimely hatched, detested of God, and irkesome to the world,) haue of late daies endeuoured with might & maine, to disturbe, & extinguish it, & to take it quite out of the way. For the speedie conuersion, or else for the vtter confusion, of which professed enemies of the godly vnitie and true christian peace of Gods Sion, I deeme them right happie, who can in any small measure concur by way of redresse, and put to their helping hand. Against the former sect, I haue published many books, challenging all English Iesuites, Seminaries, & Iesuited Papists; yea prouoking and adiuring them all ioyntly and seuerally, to frame some answere either to all or to some one of the saide bookes. But wil ye haue the truth? their harts faile them, their own consciēces accuse them, they are at their wits end, & know not in the world what to say or write. They will not answere,



and why I pray you? because forsooth they cannot, but to their owne shame and confusion euerlasting. For if they could, they would vndoubtedlie answere mee, so to saue their owne credite, and the life of their late harched Romish Religion. About three yeeres agoe, a railing Iesuit, an odde swaggering Diuine terming himselfe E. O. in his detection against Maister D. Sutcliffe, and Maister Willet, taketh notice of the bookes which I haue published against them, and telleth his Readers, (if they may beleeue him,) that the confutation of my workes is vndertaken. But what followeth? (and the said confutation must be published, if it shall be thought expedient.) By which words with the circumstances annexed thervnto, wee may easily vnderstand three memorable points. First, that the Papists are mightilie troubled, about the answearing of my bookes. Secondly, that they can not tell in the worlde, how and in what sort to answere them. Thirdly, that they would haue all their Popish Vassalls to think, that they haue alreadie answered them; and that they are not published, because it is not thought a thing expedient to bee done. But I pray thee, gentle Reader; who will beleeue these Iesuits? what wise man will euer thinke that the Iesuits haue for the space of eyght or nine yeares considered howe to answere my bookes, and after the answere is vndertaken, cannot tell if it bee expedient to publishe the same? for as the Philosopher can tell them, Vltimum in executione, debet primum esse in intentione. That which is the last in execution, must bee the first in intention. Yea, the very light of Nature and daylie experience teacheth vs; that in all our actions wee must chieflie and principallie respect the end, for the which wee intende to doe them. They dare not fight the combat valiantly, neyther with the long sworde,



nor yet with the shorte. They dare not encounter mee, and cast mee their Gauntlet, No, no, Negry quidem, can bee extorted from their pennes. Against the latter sect, because they whollie dissent from the Papists, and agree with our English Churche, in the chiefest fundamentall points of Doctrine, an other manner of methode, and a different kinde of proceeding, must bee vsed against them. They exclaime with open mouthes, and crie out against our English Church; flying from our companies, and detesting vs, as prophane, polluted, and forlorne people. They vse Conventicles, Whisperings, and meetings, in Woodes, Fieldes, and odde corners. They beare the simple people in hand, that our Temples are prophaned; our Doctrine corrupt, our Sacraments impure, our Byshops Antichristian, and our kind of Church-gouernment repugnant to that sacred forme and order, which our LORD IESVS prescribed in his holie worde. They say of themselues (but Laus propriioris sordescit,) that they are inspired of the holy Spirit, that they are sent from Heauen to reforme our Church, and to direct it into all Truth. With which faire speeches, and sugred words, (alas for pittie) they seduce the rude vulgar sorte, steale away their hearts, and make them disobedient to higher powers. And while these good fellowes, (the Brownists and Martinists,) seeke to bee reputed the onely wisemen vpon Earth, they neither knowe what they say, nor yet whereof they affirme; but doe open a large window to all disloyaltie and sedition euery where, and giue the Papists some comforte and hope, once to enioye theyr long expected daye. In regarde hereof (most Reuerend Father, and worthie Prelate,) my selfe (though the meanest of manie thousands in this our English



Churche) haue thought it operaepretium, to vse my Penne in my plaine and simple manner, for the vnitie and true peace of our English Sion. and for the manifestation of the lawfull gouernmēt thereof. I haue in this present discourse (most honourable, constant, wise, and christian Patron, of the Churches libertie, power, freedome, & auncient prerogatiue, which the Brownists and foolish Martinists would turne vpside downe,) made euident demonstration of the lawfull gouernment of our Church. And that is done in such compendious manner, as neither the Reading can be thought tedious, nor the price of the book chargeable, with such perspicuitie, as the most simple, (euen very babes and children,) may with al facility understād the same with such sufficiēcie, as no Brownist, or Martinist, or other malitious aduersarie of our churches godly setled gouernment whosoeuer, shall euer be able while the world indures: either with Scriptures, Councels, Fathers, or Ecclesiastical Histories, to gain say or with stand the same. I haue succinctly and euidently, set down before the eyes of the indifferent Reader, that the monarchical gouernāce of our English church, is both the best and the most laudable of all others. That there is & euer hath beene in all former ages of the church, superioritie of one church-minister aboue and ouer another, and that one may this day lawfully haue iurisdiction ouer another. That Bishops, Arch-bishops, Primates, Metropolitains, & Patriarches, haue euer beene in the church: euen from the Apostles themselues. That no church-laws, canons, ordinances, or constitutions Ecclesiasticall whatsoeuer; either ought to be established, or can bee of force, strength, power, or authoritie, without the lawfull assent of the supreme ciuill magistrate. That the church hath power,



freedome, & authoritie, to dispose of all indifferent things, to ordaine ceremonies, and Ecclesiastical rites, to appoint, make, constitute, and establish lawes, canons, ordinances, and constitutions whatsoeuer not repugnant to Gods holy word, so that it be done for any one of these three ends, vz. For order, for comlinesse, or for edification sake, that there is grauitie, decencie, modestie, and edification; as well in the apparell allotted for the Ministers and the ministerie, as in the other ceremonies of our English Church. That the gouernment of euery particular Church may be altered and changed, as the circumstances of times, places, and persons shal require. That no charge is so tied to the practise of the Apostles, but for her necessitie she may alter & change the same. Many other points of great moment, are handled in this compendious discourse. To which or to some part thereof, all that may be reduced with facilitie, whatsoeuer the aduersaries haue said or possibly can say, against the gouernment of our English Church. The worke such as it is, (most gratious Lord,) I humbly dedicate vnto your grace, as well to giue a signification of a thankefull minde for all your graces fauours towards me, namely, for your great liberalitie in time of my sicknesse at my last being at London, as also for your graces most Christiā zeale, singular care, & painful endeuours, employed for the good and quiet of the Church; both of late dayes, about the most profitable and necessarie canons of Anno, 1604; and in former times, euen euer since Church-gouernment was first imposed vpon you. For which holy vigilancie and godly care, though the Brownists, the Martinists, and other enuious and malitious male-contents, doe both thinke and speake hardly of your grace, yet are all that loue the common good and peace of our English Church, bound in the



highest degree to bee thankfull to your Grace for the same. The Almightie preserue your Grace, confirme your Godlie zeale against the disturbers of the common peace, and giue you a long and happie life vpon Earth, (for his owne glorie, and the Godlie gouernment of his Church,) and life eternall in the worlde to come.
            Amen.
            
               Your Graces most humble and most bounden, Thomas Bell.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            THE REGIMENT of the Church.
            
               CHAP. I. Of sundrie kinds of gouernment, with the nature, qualitie, and condition of the same.
               
                  
                     ARistotle, that worthy, learned, & famous Philosopher, shewing plainly in a large politicall discourse, that there be three kinds of lawful Regiment, and three likewise of wicked Gouernement, neither more nor fewer. The first lawfull kinde is called, Monarchia, a Monarchy, when Monarchia. one alone doth rule & gouerne. The second is called, Aristocráteia, an Aristocratie, when a fewe of Aristocrvteia. the best in the common-weale doe gouerne it. The third is called Democratia, a Democratie; when many of the vulgar Democratia. people doe rule. For euery state of the Church & cōmon weale, doth either seeke the publique good thereof, or their owne priuate gaine and pleasure. If the common good be sought and intended, the gouernment is godly; but if priuate Aristotel. Lib. 3. Polit Cap. 5. & Lib. 8 Ethic. Cap. 10. gaine or pleasure be either wholy or principally intended, the gouernment is wicked. If the gouernment be lawfull, right, and godly; it is either by one, and called a Monarchie; or by some fewe of the best, and called an Aristocratie; or by many, and called a Democratie. If the King or



Monarch ruling alone, (as our most gratious Soueraigne hath told vs most learnedly in his Basilicōdoron) shal by the making and execution of good lawes, acknowledge himselfe 
                     Basilicon doron. Pag. 25. ordained for the good of his people, and thereupon employ all his studie, care, industrie, and endeuours, to procure, establish, and maintaine their welfare, and true christian peace, as their naturall father, and kindly maister; then is hea King indeede, and his gouernment a true Monarchy. But if he studie to frame the gouernmēt of the common weale, to aduance his priuate lucre, to satisfie his own singular contentment, and to serue his inordinate and sensuall pleasure, he is then so farre from being a king indeed, that he is become a slat tyrant, and his gouernment changed into a plaine tyrannie. If few doe gouerne well, being of the best and wisest, it is a lawfull Aristocratie: but if these few Tyrannis. gouerne wickedly, seeking their own priuate, & not the cō
                  mon Oligarchia. good, it is called an vngodly Oligarchie. If many rule wel, it is called a Democratie or popular state, but if they gouerne naughtily, it is termed a Timocratie, Ochlocratie, or Anarchy. 
                  Timocratia Ochlocratia. Anarchia. Wher the gentle reader must seriously obserue with me, that paucitie and multitude, are not the essential differences of Oligarchie and Timocratie: but wealth and pouerty are the things indeed, which work the intrinsecal distinction in these defects of pollicie. These kinds of Regiment may analogically in some proportion, be applied to the inferiour magistrates vnder his most excellent maiestie; viz. to the LLs. of the most honourable priuie Councell, the L. Analogice in suo genere. Chauncellour, the L. Treasurer, the Iustices of the Kings-Beneh & Cōmon place, Barons of the Exchequer, Iustices of Peace, &c. & in sundry places and causes, to the cōmons of this Realme. Which obseruation if it be wel remembred. will be a motiue to put euery one of them in mind of their place & calling, that they may vse their gouernment accordingly. This discourse is so cleere and euident, as I decme it a thing altogether needlesse to vse further proofe therein. For all learned men, both Philosophers and Diuines, doe with vniforme assent subscribe thereunto.
               
                  
                  
                     Obiection. 1.
                  The Law of nature teacheth vs, that wee may loue our selues more then our neighbours. For which respect, God himselfe appointed mans own loue to be the squire & rule, by which he must measure his loue toward his neighbour. The king therefore is not bound to regard more the good of his subiects, then his owne priuate commoditie, and the contentation of his mind.
               
               
                  The Answere.
                  I answere with S. Austen, that kings must serue God two waies. First, as men: which thing is performed, by liuing August. epist. 50. ad Bonifa
                           •
                        . godly, soberly, & iustly. Secondly, as kings; which they may    performe, by the making & execution of godly lawes, for    the honour and seruice of God principally: and secondarily, for the cōmon good and peaceable gouernment of their people. I say, (by the making & execution of godly lawes,) because it is not enough for Kings to make godly lawes, vnlesse they procure the same to be duly executed. In the former respect, kings may loue themselues more then their subiects; but in the latter, (viz. as they are kings,) they must haue greater care to procure the welfare and good of their people, then the welfare and good of themselues. And the same may be said Analogically & proportionally, of all inferiour magistrates. To which I must needs adde, that the honour, wealth, and preseruation of a king, is indeede the honour, wealth, peace, and good of his people. So that euery way the kings owne loue is respected, and his own honour and good procured.
               
               
                  
                     Obiection. 2.
                  If the king, by his vngodly gouernment, may become a tyrant, then may his subiects resist his proceedings, then may they depose him from his royall Diademe, Scepter, and Regalitie.
               
               
                  
                  The Answere.
                  I answere, that a kingdome may be possessed two waies; viz, by election, and by succession or discent of blood royall. They that are kings the first way (as the Emperour of the Romans, the king of Polonia, and if there be any others of like sort,) if they change their gouernment into tyrannie, and violate the lawes, to which by couenant, oath, and promise, they stand obliged in their election; they (I say,) may be deposed by the same power & authoritie, by which they were inuested into their throne. The reason hereof is euident; because the possession, right, and vse of their regall authoritie, is not independant & absolute, but conditionall and relatiue; and consequently, such a King degenerating from his oath and promise, standeth at the curtesie of his electors, concerning the interest, possession, and vse of his prerogatiue royall. But they, who are Kings by discent and succession in blood royall, (as is our most wise, pious, learned, and religious Soueraigne, who happily this day raigneth ouer vs,) haue an absolute and independāt soueraigntie ouer their subiects, which neither doth, nor euer did stand, in the curtesie, power, and pleasure of their people. For Kings by succession and discent in blood royall, are Kings Ipso facto, so soone as their auncestors are deceased, euen before the act of their annointing and Coronation, as also before the oathe; which vsually they take for the godly administration of their kingdomes. Such ceremonies, though they be very comely and expedient for sundrie respects, yet are they not any essential part of their princely Kings by succession, are Kings indeed, before their Coronation. rights and royall prerogatiue, how necessarie soeuer some esteeme the same, deeming them no Kings without them. And consequently, their proceedings may not vndutifully be resisted: much lesse may their authoritie begain said; and least of all may their sacred persons be deposed from their S

Much lesse may the people for sake their obedience to his authoritie, because they must forsake their obedience to his vices. Hee may be shunned priuatelie, and his vices detested generallie: but loyall obedience and faithfull seruice, may neuer be denied him Hec may bee admonished by the Bishoppes in the court of Conscience, concerning his publique offences: but he may neuer be iudged in the court of their Consistorie, touching his Royal power, and Princely prerogatiue. He may be reprooued, if his faults be publique and notorious; but his subiects may neuer depose him, because their authoritie stretcheth not so farre. Hee hath no Iudge that can punish him, but the great Iudge of all, euen the God of Heauen. Of which subiect I haue elsewhere disputed more at large. The generall councel of Constance (where was present that great In my motiu

               CHAP. II. Of the chiefest and best kinde of Gouernment.
               
                  
                     ARistotle that famous Philosopher, hauing reckoned vp the three former kindes of Gouernment, adjoyneth forthwith these golden wordes; Atque harum optima quidem est regnum, deterrima verò censuum potestas, And the best of these Gouernements, is a Monarchie Aristot. Ethicor. lib. 8. cap. 10. lib. 3. polit. cap. vlt. or Kingdome, but the worst is a Democratie.
               
               The Israelites and people of the Iewes, were euer gouerned by a Monarchie; euen from Adam vnto Christes most sacred Aduent. For    first, the Patriarkes had the rule and  gouernment. Secondly, Moses and Iosua were the leaders    and gouernours of the people. Thirdly, Gedeon,  
                    
                  Iair, Samson, and others, did rule and iudge the Israelites. Fourthly, Kings, Saul, Dauid, Salomon, Iehosaphat, Ezechias,  
                    
                  Ioas, and others.  Fiftly, Zorobabel and the Machabees    were gouernours. And this gouernment continued, euen from the Captiuitie vntil Christ.
               
               This kinde of gouernment to bee the best, may easilie be prooued: as well by the manner of Mans creation, as by the naturall propension giuen vnto him. Touching the manner, wee are all framed of one, not of many. The Protoplast Adam, of the earth; of him, Eue; of them twaine, all the rest. Herevppon Saint Chrysostome, (who for his great learning and Eloquence, was surnamed the golden mouthed Doctor,) concludeth a Monarchie or Kingdome, to bee the best kinde of Gouernment vppon earth. His wordes are these: Equidem si quanquam


                  
                  hoc sint pacto geniti, primus tamen statim hominum semine parentum procreatus adeo insaniuit, tantam rixam, tantam inuidiam Diaboltes seminauit; quid put as fecisset, si non ab eadem prorsus radice pullulasset genus h

               For although they be thus be gotten, yet if hee that was the first man produced by the seede of his parents, did so rage, and was so furious: and if the Diuell also did raise vp such contention and enuie: what thinkest thou would hee haue done, if mankinde had not issued out of the same 
                     •
                  oote? He therefore commanded the one to rule, the other to obey. For he knew, that emulation would arise among equalls. He therefore would not haue a Democratie, or popular state, but a Kingdome. Thus writeth this learned

                  ather.
               Touching naturall propension, which must needes bee referred to God the author of Nature: it appeareth by it, that a Monarchie or rule of one, is most agreeable to nature it selfe. For first, in euery house the Father of the familie    doth gouerne all the rest: the wife, the children, and the seruants. Againe, the greatest part of the whole worlde,    a gouerned by kings. Thirdly, Monarchies and Kingdomes    are farre more auncient, then either Aristocraties, or Democraties. For proofe hereof, the onely testimonie of she excellent Historiographer Iustinus may suffice. These are his words: Principio rerum, gentium nationumque impe

               In the beginning of the world, the gouernment of people and nations was vnder Kings: whome vertue, & not popular ambition, aduaunced to that high seate of Maiestie. Fourthly, the creatures which are without    reason, and haue onely sense, seeme naturally to desire the gouernment of one. The holy Fathers doe



so testifie of them, and experience it selfe doth shew it to be so. S Hierome hath these words; Nulla ars absque magistro discitur. Etiam muta animalia & ferarum greges, ductores sequuntur snos.

               No Art is learned without a maister. Yea, euen the dumbe cattell, and slockes of wilde beastes, doe all follow their leaders. The Bees haue their gouernours; & the very Cranes follow on in order, in forme of a letter. There is one Emperour. There is one iudge of a prouince. Rome was no sooner built, then it abhorred to haue two kings at once to rule ouer it; so as without cruell murder, the dedication thereof was not accomplished. But what neede is thereof further proofe in this dispute? seeing it is euident to al that hold the Christian faith aright, that God omnipotent is the supreme Monarch in heauen and earth, and gouerneth by that kind of regiment, which is neither Democraticall, nor yet Aristocratical, but monarchicall; and consequently, a monarchy must needes be the best kind of gouernment. And whosoeuer can and list to read that holy, auncient, and learned father S. Ciprian, shall finde this discourse so apparant, as he Ciprian deidolorum vanitate can neuer stand long in doubt thereof. I therfore conclude, that whosoeuer shall denie a simple monarchie to be the best kind of gouernment, must perforce fall vnawares, into the error of the Marcionistes, of the Manichies, and of the Ethnickes. For if it be true, as it is most true, as all Christians must confesse, that the world is ruled in the best maner and best kind of gouernment by God that made it, it must follow of necessitie, that neither a Democratie, nor yet an Aristocrat

                  NOw seeing it is true, (as is alreadie proued,) that a Monarchie is the best kind of gouernment, and that the Church and common-weale of England, is gouerned by a most wise, most learned, most vigilant, and most religious Monarch, Gods saithfull seruant, and our gratious and most happie Soueraigne, it followeth by a necessarie consequence, that the kind of gouernment vsed in the Church and common-weale of England, is the best and most laudable of all other. For (as our gratious soueraigne 
                     Basilicon doron. Pag. 41. Chrysost in 13. Cap ad Roman. Cyprian. libr 1. epis. 3. writeth most learnedly,) paritie is an enemy to vnitie, and the mother of confusion. The selfe same saith S. Chrysostome, when he auoucheth degrees and superioritie to haue therefore bene appointed, because equalitie engendreth strife and contention. The same sai h S. Cyprian, when he affirmeth boldly, that heresie, or Schisme did not rise of any other occasion, but onely vpon this, that there was not one Priest and one Iudge for the time, appointed in the Church in the stead of Christ, to whom the whole brotherhood should yeelde obedience. The same saith S. Hierome, when he auoucheth one to haue beene chosen among

Yea, a Monarchicall gouernment is so necessarie euery where, and in all sorts of creatures, that S. Chrysostome acknowledgeth it amongst the bruite beasts: in the Bees, Cranes, slockes of sheepe, and Fishes of the Sea. And therfore after a long discourse, he concludeth in these wordes, Libertas

                  OF this theame I haue written more largely in other treatises, and therefore 
                     See the downfall of Poperie, & the golden ballance of triall. I purpose now to speake no more therof, then I deeme conuenient for the matter I haue in hand. For which purpose it were enough to well effected Readers, to call to minde that the godly Kings as well in time of the law of Moses, as in the time of the new testament and lawe of grace, did manage all matters both of Church and Common-weale; and therefore 
                     Ios. 1. 8. Numer. 27. Vers. 17. 2. par. 23. Vers. 11. the ciuill magistrate was commanded to reade the booke of the whole lawe, as well of the first as of the second table, and to studie the same night and day. Therefore was the ciuil magistrate commaunded, to goe out and in, before the people, and to leade them out and in, that the congregation of the Lord, bee not as sheepe which haue no shepheard. Therefore was the booke of the Lawe, deliuered into the Kings hands, at such time as hee receiued the crowne and was annointed. Musculus a great learned man, and famous writer, affirmeth resolutely; that the care of reforming and maintaning religion, doth more



appertaine to the ciuill magistrate, then to the Ministers of the Church. His expresse wordes are these; Moses Primus catholicus Israelis magistratus, personam

Sequitur; in persona Samuelis cohaesere quidèm & magistratus & sacerdotium, veram moderandae religionis curam sustinuit ille quoque, non vt sacerdos, sed vt magistratus, quo, tum non erat in Israele superior: vt magistratus indicabat Israelem, ac disponebat publica omnia, tam sacrae quam prophana; vt sacerdos sacrificabat, pro populo orabat, illumque docebat.
               
               
                  Moses the first Catholique Magistrate in Israel, bearing the person not of a priest which was imposed vpon Aaron, but of an higher power like vnto a Kings, appointed order for all manner of Religion in the people of GOD, and prescribed to Aaron himselfe and to the order of the Leuits, both what they should doe, and what they should auoide and leaue vndone. Wherein we see euidently, that the care of ordering Religion doth more pertaine to the higher magistrate, then to the order of the Priests. After the death of Moses, the care of Religion, together with the Magistracie, was devolued not to Eleazar the Priest, but to Iosuah the sonne of Nun, who was not of the Tribe of Leui, but of Ephraim. To him God gaue cōmandement, that he sho

doubtlesse was the signe of Gods couenant, which pertaineth wholy to religiō. In the person of Samuel, there did cohere both the Magistracie & the Priesthood; but he receiued the charge of moderating religion, not as hee was a Priest, but as hee was a Magistrate, greater then whom there was none at that time in Israel. As a magistrate, he did iudge Israel, and ordered all publique affaires, as well sacred as prophane, ecclesiastical as ciuill; but as a Priest, hee offered sacrifice, prayed for the people, and taught them.
               Out of these wordes of this great learned writer, I note these golden lessons for the good of the well affected Reader. First, that Moses was a ciuill magistrate, hauing authoritie    like vnto a king. Secondly, that his power was greater, then was the authoritie of Aaron the hie Priest. Thirdly,    that Moses ordered all matters in religion, and not Aaron  
                    who was the hie Priest. Fourthly, that he appointed to Aaron and to the whole order of the Leuites, both what    they should doe, and what they should leaue vndone. Fiftly, that the charge & care of religion, doth appertaine more    neerely to the magistrate, then to the order of the Priests. Sixtly, that the magistrate hath the charge and care of ordering    religion, inseparably annexed to his ciuill office, in that hee is a magistrate.   
               
               Seuenthly, that a Bishop may haue authoritie to deale in ciuil causes, as Samuel did. Eightly, that Samuel disposed all    ecclesiasticall affaires, not as hee was Priest, but as hee was

                        de, Psal. 2. the ciuill Magistrate. All which obseruations, this learned writer proueth by the examples of many kings; of Dauid, Salomon, Asa, Iosaphat, Ezechias, and others. And of King Dauid, hee addeth this most golden and memorable sentence; (Dauid) quoniam sciebat hanc primam curam pertinere ad reges & magistratus, vt religio Deiritè disponatur, hortatus cos est ad id offi

                     ij. Dauid because he knewe this chiefe care to pertaine to magistrates, to see religion rightly ordered, he exhorted them to that office, saying; Now ô Kings vnderstand, be learned, yee that iudge the earth. Whosoeuer readeth this learned writer seriously throughout his whole



discourse, can no longer stand doubtfull of the truth of this question. 
                     Zanchius de Religione cap. 16. art. 9
               
               
                  Zanchius a most learned writer, and a man of singular iudgement, in that booke which he left, for a testimonie of his faith and Christian beliefe vnto the world, and therefore the more to be regarded, hath these expresse wordes: Improbamus & illos, qui authoritatem in religione, necis tantum causa attribuūt magistratibus: dum illos negant authoritatem habere convocandi synodos, deliberandide religione, reformandiecclesias, & quae ad populorum salutem pertinent, e sacris literis statuends, aliudque eo esse nolunt, quàm eorum quae ab episcopis definiuntur, exequntores.
               
               Wee reproue in like manner all those, who yeelde and giue authoritie in religion vnto Magistrates, onely in Capitall matters touching death, whilest they denie them authoritie to call Synodes to consult of religion, to reforme Churches, and to appoint out of Gods word, the things that pertaine to the saluation of their subiects: and will onely haue them to bee the bare exequutors of those things, which the Bishops doe decree.
               Thus writeth this learned Doctor, a man of as great a iudgement, as any is in the christian world. Out of whose words I note first, that he condemneth many, who now adaies    thinke themselues very wise. Secondly, he auoweth    that magistrates haue authoritie to call Synodes. Thirdly,    that they haue power to deliberate of religion. Fourthly,    that they haue authoritie to reforme the ministers and church-affaires. Fiftly, that they haue power to order those    things, which pertaineth vnto mans saluation.
               Maister Martyr a very learned writer, discourseth at large, both of the authoritie of the minister and of the magistrate. He sheweth most excellently, both how the minister 
                     Petrus Martyr, in lib. Iudic. cap. 19. Fol. 161. ought to exhort and rebuke the magistrate, and how the magistrate ought to reforme, gouerne, and punish the minister. Some part of his golden discourse I will briefely set downe, referring the reader for the rest to the place quoted in the margent.

                  longè falluntur, qui clamitare solent; quid conscionator cum rep quid cū armis? quid cum pharmacopolis? quid cū cocis? at dicat &c. There is nothing in the whole world, to which the word of God doth not extend it selfe. Wherefore they are farre deceiued, that are wont to exclaime and say; What hath the Preacher to doe with the Common-weale? what hath he to doe with warres? what with the Apothecaries? what with cookes? but let these good fellowes tell vs, why the Minister of Gods word, when he perceiueth Gods law to bee transgressed in these things, may not rebuke the same out of Gods word? why hee may not admonish the malefactors? why he may not exhort them to desist from sinne? it is his part doubtlesse to reproue sinners; not with the sword, not with Pecuniarie mulct, not with imprisonment, not with the sword, not with exile, but with the force & power of Gods word. Then this learned man proceeds, and telleth vs, that the ciuill Magistrate must see and prouide, that the Bishops, Pastors, & Doctors of the Church, doe teach Gods word purely, rebuke sinners fatherly, and administer the Sacraments reuerently. After this, he telleth his Reader, that kings haue not charge onely of the bodies of their subiects, but of their soules also. For, (saith this great learned Doctor,) we must not make princes swineheards and heardmen for keepers of cattell, who haue care onely of the bellies, flesh, and skinnes of their subiects; because kings must prouide & see, that their subiects liue vertuously and in the feare of God: yea, he saith further, that if the Ministers teach not aright, or doe not administer the Sacraments orderly: thē the Magistrate must reduce them into order, and see that they teach sincerely, and doe not abuse the Sacraments, nor deliuer thē otherwise then Christ hath commanded. And if they liue wickedly and disorderly, he must depose them from the Ministerie. Thus writeth this Doctor, and much more he hath to the like effect, but I studie to be briefe.

                  Calvin. in Epist. ante Esaiam, ad Eliza.

               Of the Degrees of Ministers, Bishops, Arch-bishops, Metropolitanes, and Patriarches, and of their Antiquitie in the best and purest times of the Church.
               
                  Paragraph first, of the degrees and superioritie of one Minister ouer an other.
                  
                     SAint Austin that famons writer and 
                        Aug. vixit, A. D. 399. strong pillar of Christs Church, who liued aboue 1200. yeares agoe, affirmeth resolutely and plainly vnto S. Hierome beeing then an Elder or Presbyter of Christes Church: that his authoritie and degree, was aboue S. Hieromes, because hee was a Bishop. These are S. Austins owne words: 
                        Augustin. Epist. 19. to. a p. 52. 
                     Quanquam. n. secundum honorum vocabula, quae iam vsus ecclesiae obtinuit, episcopatus presbyterio maior sit, tamen in multis rebus Augustinus Hieronymo minor est: licet etiam a minore quolibet, non sit refugienda vel dedignanda correctio.
                  
                  For although according to the wordes of honour, which now are of force by the custome of Christes Church, the degree & office of a Bishop is greater thē the degree & office of a Priest or Elder: yet Austin is in many things inferiour to Hierome, neither may the superiour disdaine to be rebuked of his inferiour.
                  Out of these wordes of S. Austin, I obserue first, that to    be a Bishop in S. Austins time, (at which time it cannot bee denied, but the Church was in good state and order,) was



an higher degree then to bee a Priest or Elder. Secondly, that Bishops were in those dayes honourable, and called Lord Bishops; which I gather out of these words, (secundum  
                       
                     honorum vocabula) according to the wordes of honour. Thirdly, that this superioritie amongst Ministers had been a long time in the Church, euen before S. Austins dayes, because Saint Austine saith, this superioritie came by the custome of the Church.
                  S. Hierome, who liued in S. Austins dayes, confirmeth S. Austins testimonie touching the superioritie of one minister ouer an other: these are his wordes: Nam & Alexandriae à 
                     
                        Hier. epist. ad Euagr. tom. 3 fol. 150. B.
                      
                     Marco Euangelista vsque ad Heraclam & Dionysium Episcopos, presbyteri semper vnum ex se electum in excelsiori gradu collocatum episcopum nominabant: quomodo si exercitus imperatorem faciat: aut diaconi eligant de se, quem industrium noverint, & archidiaconum vocent. quid. n
                           •
                        facit excepta ordinatione episcopus, quod presbyter non faciat? sequitur: presbyter & episcopus, aliud aetatis, aliud dignitatis est nomen. sequitur: quod Aaron, & filij eius, at que Levitae in templo suerunt, hoc sibi episcopi, & presbyteri, & diaconi vendicent in ecclesia.
                  
                  For at Alexandria, from Marke the Euangelist vnto Heraclas and Dionysius being both Bishops, the Priestes did 
                        This was A. D. 6. 4. whiles S. Peter, S. Paul, and others were yet liuing.
                      alwayes choose one among them, whom they placed in an higher degree, and called him Bishop: as if an host of men should make a Generall ouer them: or the Deacon chuse one of themselues, whom they sawe more vigilant, and should call him Arch-deacon. For what doth a Bishop sauing the ordination, that a Priest doth not? Touching a Priest and Bishop, the one is the name of age, the other of dignitie. That which Aaron, and his sonnes, and the Leuites were in the temple, the same may the Bishops, and Priestes, and Deacons challenge in the Church.
                  Out of these wordes of this holy Father and learned writer, I note first, that a Bishop hath an higher degree in    the Church, then hath a Priest or Elder. I note secondly, that this superioritie among Ministers, hath euer beene in   


                     
the Church since the time of Saint Marke the Euangelist. Thirdly, that the name of a Bishop is the name of dignitie    & honour. Fourthly, that as Aaron had a degree aboue    the Priestes in the time of Moses, so haue Bishops now a degree aboue the other Ministers or Elders. Fiftly, that a    Bishop onely ordeyneth Ministers.
                  Saint Chrisostome, who liued in Saint Austines time, had very great superioritie ouer Bishops; for hee was not onely Bishop of Constantinople, but also ruled many other Churches, both in Thracia, Pontus and Asia. These are the expresse words of Theodoretus in his historie, concerning this matter: Atque hoc modo prospexit non illi solum civitati, 
                     
                        Theodor. hist. eccl. lib. 5. cap. 28.

                  And Chrysostome the Bishop of (Constantinople) did by this meanes not onely prouide for that citie, but also, for all Thracia, which is diuided into sixe Bishoptickes: as also for the whole Countrey of Asia, which hath in it eleuen Bishops. He also ruled Pontus which hath the same number of Bishops with Asia, and beautified it with the same Lawes.
                  Out of these words of this holy Father, worthily surnamed the golded mouthed Doctor; I obserue first, that hee    was the Arch-bishop of Constantinople. Secondly, that hee    had also iurisdiction Archiepiscopall, ouer 28. Bishops; in Thracia, Asia, and Pontus. And that the Reader may fully know what iurisdiction this holy Father vsed ouer these Churches; two things must be remembred, which are set downe in the place quoted in my Margent. The one, that he commaunded the Priests to liue after the Lawes. The other, that he did

                     ptiue them of their Priestly function, which did violate and transgresse the lawes. So then it is cleare and euident, that there are degrees of superioritie amongst Ministers; yea, that one Bishop hath iurisdiction



ouer another: as S. Chrysostome being a Patriarch, had ouer 28. other Bishops.
                  S. Ignatius, who was Bishop of Antioch, and S. Iohns disciple, and liued in the Apostles time, A. D. 97 sheweth euidently, 
                        An, D. 9. 7. that in his time one Minister had rule ouer another, the Bishops ouer the Priests. For writing to the people of Smyrna in Asia, he hath these expresse words; Honorate Deum, vt authorem omnium & dominum, Episcopum autem tanquam principem sacerdotum, imaginem Des forentem; principatum quidem secundum deū, sacerdotium verò secundum Christum. Honour God as the authour and Lorde of all things, and a Bishop, as the Prince or chief of Priests, bearing the image of God; superioritie according to GOD. Priest-hood according to Christ. And in the same Epistle hee reckoneth vp seuerall degrees: of Bishops, Priests, Deacons, and Lay-men. The same Ignatius, in that Epistle which he wrote to the Church of Trallis in Asia hath these words: Quid est. n. Episcopus, nisi omnem principatum & potestatem omnium illorum tenens, quemadmodum deceat hominem tenere imitationē des factum secundū virtutē. For what is a Bishop, but one that hath power and rule ouer them all, (he speaketh of Priestes and Deacons,) as it becommeth a man made according to vertue, to keepe the imitation of God. Thus writeth this holy Father, who suffered a most cruell death for the testimonie of Iesus Christ: beeing cast out to wilde beasts, to be torne of them in pieces for the truthssake. 
                        Euseb lib. 3 cap. 30. Hier. in catal script. eccles. tom 1. fol. 124. A. Augusti. ac haeresib ad quodvult deum to. 6. haeres. 53. Of these his Epistles and Martyrdome, S. Polycarpe, S. Hierome, and Eusebius Caesariensis, doe all three yeede a most lawdable and constant testimonie; such as is able to penetrate any mans heart, that shall seriously peruse the same.
                  S. Epiphanius, and S. Austin, doe both of them enroll among heresies, this opinion of Aerius: that a Priest, or Pastor, was equall to a Bishop. Cum esset presbyter, inquit Augustinus, doluisse fertur, quod Episcopus non potuit ordinari. Sequitur: dicobat etiam, presbyterum ab Episcoponulla differentia


                     
                     debere discerni. Aerius saith S. Austin, being himselfe a Priest, is reported to haue bene very sory, that hee could not be made a Bishop. The same Aerius held also this opinion, that there was no difference betwixt a Priest and a Bishop. S. Epiphanius affirming that Aerius held the same 
                        Epiphan. cont. haeres. lib. 3. to. 1. haeres. 75. pag. 196. errour, confuteth it by many sound reasons, amongst which this is one: Dicere. n igsum Episcopum & Prosbyterum aequalem esse, quomodo erit possibile? Episcoporum. n. ordo patrum generator est: patres. n. generat ecclesia. Presbyterorum verò non potens generare patres, per lavacri regenerationem generat filios ecclesiae: non tamen patres aut doctores. For to say, that a Bishop and a Priest are equall, how is it possible? For the order of Bishops is the begetter of the Fathers: for that order begetteth Fathers to the Church. But the order of Priests is not of abilitie to beget the Fathers: but it begetteth sonnes to the Church by the regeneration of Baptisme: yet not Fathers or Doctors. This auncient Father liued aboue 12. hundred yeares agoe, at which time it was holden for a grosse errour generally, to say, affirme, or thinke, that A. D. 372. a Priest was equall to a Bishop, in degree, dignitie, or iurisdiction.
                  This reason which S. Epiphanius maketh touching the begetting of Fathers to the Church, is invincible, and neuer can be answered. It is the very same in substance with that of S. Hieromes, which I haue set downe alreadly: viz. that a Bishop differeth from a Pastorall Elder, by the power of ordaining and making Ministers. And, to proue the superioritie of a Bishop aboue a Priest, or Pastorall Elder: that which Saint Austin telleth vs of Aerius, is a flat and euident demonstration. For Aerius being a Priest, sought by all meanes to bee a Bishop, and was sorie that hee could not attaine and accomplish his desire. For greife whereof, hee opposed himselfe against the prudent and godly setled order of the Church: affirming very desperately as Saint Epiphanius saith, that a Priest was



euery way equal to a Bishop. Now I pray you who knoweth not this to bee true? that a wise man will neuer bes

An Elder and a Bishop are all one, and before dissention by the diuels procurement arose in the Church, and the people began to say, I am of Paul, I of Apolle, and I of Cophas; the churches were gouerned by the common consent of the Pastorall Elders, Ministers, or Priests. But after that euery one did thinke those to be his, and not Christs, whom he had baptized; it was decreed throughout the whole world, that one of the ministers or Priest should bee chosen and set ouer the rest, to whom the whole care of the Church should appertaine, that the seeds of schisme might be taken away.
                  Out of these plaine aslertions of this holy, learned, and auncient father, I obserue first, that in the very beginning of    the primitiue church, al the ministers were equal in degree, and did gouerne the church with a general & cōmon consent. Secondly, that in very short time the diuell raised vp    such dissention in the church, that it was thought meete to alter the kind of gouernment, & to set one minister ouer the rest. Thirdly, yt this was done to take away schisme. Fourthly,    that this alteratiō was made, euen in the Apostles dayes,    
                     viz. whē one said he held of Paul, an other, he held of Peter an other, he held of Apollo: at what time S. Marke the Euangelist, was made the Bishop of Alexandria. Fiftly, that this    superioritie among the ministers of the church, was decreed 
                        Jrenaus adVers. Heres. libr. 5. cap. 2. pag. 589. by a settled lawe throughout the whole world. S. Irenaeus hath these wordes; Omnes. n. hij valaë posteriores sunt quam episcopi, quibus Apostoli tradiderunt ecclesias.
                  
                  For all these come farre after Bishops, to whom the Apostles committed the charge of churches.
                  Maister Zuinglius a famous and zealous defender of the Gospell, is wholy consonant to these holy and ancient Fathers.

                  Saint Timothy and S. Titus, had superioritie ouer all other Ministers, both at Ephesus, and at Creta; and consequently, they were made Arch-bishops by Saint Paul himselfe.



This is constantly affirmed. both by Saint Crysostome. Theodoritus, Oecumenius, and many other famous writers. Saint Chrysostome hath these expresse wordes; Vnus ex Pauls socij

                  This worthy man was one of S. Pauls fellowes; for doubtlesse, he would neuer haue committed one whole Iland vnto him, neither haue commanded things wanting to be accomplished, nor yet haue cōmitted the iudgemēt of so many Bishops vnto him, vnlesse he had had great confidence in him. Thus writeth this holy, learned, and ancient father, touching the superioritie of Titus.
                  
                  Of Timotheus the same father writeth thus; Quaeri mevitò 
                     
                        Chrysost. ad Tim. 2. hom. 10. inprincip.
                      
                     potest quomodo Timotheum adse vocet, cui ecclesiae gentisque totius crediderat gubernacula?
                  
                  It may worthily be demaunded, how hee calleth Timothy vnto him, to whom he had committed the gouernment of the Church and of the whole nation. Marke well these wordes, (gentis totius, of the whole nation;) and these wordes likewise, (integram insulam, the whole Iland;) and these wordes withall, (Muitorum episcoporum iudicium, the iudgement of many Bishops.) For out of the said wordes it is cleerely and euidently deduced, that both Timotheus and Titus were Arch-bishops in Saint Paules time; the one hauing iurisdiction ouer all Asia, the other ouer all Creta, two great and large countries.
                  
                     Illyricus a very famous late writer, and a most worthy defender 
                        Illyricus in prefat. ad 1. ep. ad Tim.
                      of Christian truth, iumpeth with S. Chrysostome in his iudgement and opinion. These are his expresse words; Harum autem tres priores scriptae ad duos praestantes doctores plurimarumque ecclesiarum episcopos. Timotheum & Titum, potissimùm informant episcopum aut superintendentem, & per cum etiam totam ecclesiam ab ipso gubernandam ac instru

But the three former of these written to two excellent Doctors and Bishops of many churches. Timotheus and Titus, doe specially informe a Bishop or superintendent, and by him the whole Church also, which must be gouerned and instructed by him. Loe here, gentle Reader; Timothie and Titus were Arch bishops, that is to say, the Bishops of many Churches. I here let passe the wordes of Theodoretus, Oecumentus, and others, in regard of breuitie.
                  Saint Cyprian, that holy, learned, and auncient Father, who 
                        Cyprian libr. 4 epist. 8 liued aboue one thousand and three hundred yeares agoe, was not only the Bishop of the famous citie of Carthage; but he had also the gouernment both of Numidia and of Mauritania, two goodly regions in Affrica. So doth S. Cyprian himselfe write of himselfe, and therefore the storie is of good credite.

                  That euery prouince had an Arch-bishop among their Bishops, and that the Councell of Nice did appoint Patriarches, which should be in order and dignitie aboue Arch-bishops, it was done for the preseruation of discipline. Although in this discourse wee may not forget that it was a thing of very rare vse. For this cause therefore were those degrees especially appointed, that if any thing should happen in any particular church, which could not there be decided, the same might be referred to a general Synod. If the greatnesse or difficultie of the cause, required yet greater consultation; then were added Patriarches together with the Synodes, from whom there could be no appeale, but onely vnto a Generall Councell. This kinde of gouernment some called a Hierarchie, a name improper and not vsed in the Scriptures, as I thinke. For the holy Ghost would not haue vs to dreame of any dominion or rule, when question is made of Church gouernment. But omitting the name, if we consider the thing it selfe; we shall find, that these old Bishops would not frame any other kind of gouernment in the Church, then that which God prescribed in his word.
                  Thus writeth Maister Caluin of the antiquitie of degrees and superioritie, amongst the Ministers of the Church. Which whosoeuer shall ponder seriously, (all partialitie set apart, (together with the constitutions, testimonie, and approbation of the most sacred and renowned generall Councel of Nice (which Councel was euer to this day highly reuerenced throughout the Christian world;) that man doubtlesse, cannot but approoue and allowe our Bishops and Arch-bishops with their names and authorities, this day established in the godly setled gouernment of the Church of England, For first, Maister Caluin graunteth willingly, the truth it self plainly leading him thereunto,)    that in the time of the famous Councell of Nice,


                     
there were both Arch-bishops and Patriarches. Secondly, that yt patriarches were in order & dignitie aboue the Arch-bishops;    and consequently, that there was euen then, (viz. aboue one thousand two hundred and fortie yeares agoe,) superioritie Episcopall, Archiepiscopall, and Patriarchall, among the ministers of the Church, one minister hauing iurisdiction ouer and vpon an other. More then which doubtlesse, our Bishops and Arch-bishops doe not this day challenge, in our Church of noble England. Thirdly, that this superioritie and dignitie among Ministers, was ordained    for the preseruation of discipline in the Church: and consequently, that as it was then godly, conuenient, and necessarie for the Church, so is it this day, in our Church of England. Fourthly, that the kinde of gouernment    by Arch-bishops and Patriarches. was agreeable to that forme of gouernment, which God prescribed in his word. This is a point of great moment, which may not bee forgotten. To which I also adde, (which the Reader must obserue seriously with mee,) that the Councell of Nice telleth vs plainely, that this superioritie of one Minister aboue and ouer an other, (which the Brownists cannot endure,) was not then first appointed, but had beene time out of minde by an auncient custome of the church, which the Councell confirmed and established by her decree. But how doe I proue it? doubtlesse, by the expresse wordes of the Councell.
                  For the Councell in the sixt Cannon, hath these 
                        Conc. Nicae. can. 6. wordes; Mos antiquus perduret. Let the olde custome continue. And in the seuenth cannon, it hath these wordes; Quoniam mos antiquus obtinuit, & vetusta traditio. Because 
                        Can. 7. an olde custome and auncient tradition hath preuailed, &c. Which olde custome had beene in the Church, euen from Saint Marke the Euangelist, and from Saint Timothy and Saint Titus, as is already prooued. And if any one will yet bee obstinate, and denie that this olde



custome, whereof the holy, and auncient Councell speaketh, beganne in the Apostles time; let that man or those persons which so shall say or affirme, name the time before the Nicene Councell, when Archbishops and Patriarches first beganne. And if any man can this performe. I promise to bee of his opinion. If otherwise, both reason and true humilitie would aduise that This can neuer be performed, while the world endureth man and those persons, who shall so say or thinke; to yeelde all due obedience to their superiours, and willingly to subscribe vnto the truth. Which doubtlesse they will doe, that heretofore haue refused to embrace the ceremonies of our English Church; if this Text of the Gospell, bee not truly verified in them; (for they loued the praise of men, more then the praise of God.) But howe is this possible? I will vnfold the case, Gentle 
                        Ioh. 12. Vers. 43. Reader; protesting that I doe it of charitie, and for edification sake. The truth I will plainly and sincerely set downe, concealing the parties name; because I loue the man, and haue regard vnto his credite. Talking with a Preacher of mine acquaintance, (a man otherwise both godly, learned, and of singular gifts,) concerning the cannons of Anno. 1604. and the kinde of gouernment of this our English Church, when hee seemed to mee, to haue nothing of moment to say against the same, hee answered mee thus: that hee would neither loose his liuing, nor weare the surplesse nor yet make the signe of the crosse in the childs forhead. And when I demaunded how that could bee; hee answered that hee would keepe one to doe it, but not doe it himselfe. When I replied, that hee might as lawfully doe This ought to be well pondered. it himselfe, as procure an other to doe it; hee vttered these wordes.
                  How can I doe that, against which I haue so often preached. I proceeded, and told him as a friend; that his refusall seemed to tast of the spirit of the proude Pharise; and not of



the humble Publican, &c. Well, I hope the partie wil be obediēt. But certes, I thought afore; that all their proceedings had been of meere conscience, which now I perceiue to be of pride in a great many of them, through which manner of dealing (I wil not say hypocrisie) the simple sort become disobedient, and are deepely drowned in errour; and our Church pitifully turmoyled, with schismes & dissention.
                  The godly, learned, and zealous Patron of pure religion, maister Bucer, deriueth the superioritie of Arch-bishops euen from the Apostles themselues. These are his expresse words; I am ex perpetua ecclesiarum observations, abipsis

                  Now we see by the perpetuall obseruation of churches, euen from the Apostles themselues; that it pleased the holy Ghost, that among the ministers to whom especially the gouernment of the church is committed, one should haue the chiefe care, both of the churches and the whole sacred ministery; & that he in that care and sollicitued, should be aboue al the rest; for which cause, the name of Bishop is peculiarly giuen to such chiefe gouernours of churches. Thus writeth maister Bucer. Out of whose words I note first, that the superioritie of Arch-bishops and bishops, proceedeth from the holy Ghost. Secondly, that this superioritie was euer in the church, euē from the Apostles. The same author    hath in yt same Chap. much more matter to the same effect.

                  When I worte this Confession of my Faith, I wrote euery thing with a good conscience; and as I beleeued, so I also freely spoke, as holy writ teacheth me to doe. My beliefe is principally & simply, grounded vpon Gods word: then, some-what also vpon the cōmon consent of the auncient Catholique Church, so it doe not swarne from the holy Scriptures. For I bel
                        •
                     eue, that such things as yt holy Fathers 
                        Vide infra, cap. 10. ex Zuinglio & notato valaè.
                      gathered together in Gods name, haue with common consent defined and receiued without any contradiction of the holy Scriptures: do proceed from the holy Ghost, though not of the same authoritie with the holy Scriptures. Hence comes it, that my selfe neither will, nor with safe conscience dare, reproue such kinde of decrees. But what is more cleare and euident, by Histories, by Councels. and by the writings of all the Fathers, then yt those orders of Ministers, (wherof we haue spoken:) haue bene appointed & receiued in the Church, euen with the common consent of the whole christian Common weale? And who am I, that I should reproue that, which the whole Church hath approued? yea, which all the learned men of our age, durst neuer reproue



to this day? as who knew (right well) that both the Church might lawfully doe these things, & also that they proceeded of pietie, & that all things were ordained to very godly purposes, for edefication of Gods elect. Thus writeth this learned, godly, zealous, and iudicious Father: who for his rare learning, profound knowledge, pure zeale, & great iudgemēt, was inferior to none of his age in Christs Church, if not superiour to all. Out of whose words I obserue many more excellent & worthy documēts, for the help of the wel affected Reader. First, that this godly learned man was fully    resolued to die in that Faith, which he heare speaketh of. Secondly, that he published this his Confession of Faith,    with a good conscience, constantly beleeuing as he wrote. Thirdly, that his Faith was grounded vppon the word of    God. Fourthly, that the Decrees of the holy Fathers assembled    in Christes name, defined by the common consent of all, and not repugnant to the Scriptures, were not simply the Decrees of men, but also of the holy Ghost. Fiftly,    that the Degrees of Ministers, and superioritie of Bishops Arch-bishops, Primates, and Patriarches, were approued and receiued by vniforme and common consent, throughout the whole Church of Christ. Sixtly, that this great    learned man neither durst, nor could with good conscience reproue the same. Seuenthly, that the Church had authoritie    to appoint, constitute & ordaine, such degrees and superiority amongst the Ministers of the Church. Eightly,    that such constitutiōs proceeded of pietie, & were ordeined for edisicatiō of the Church. To the testimony of this graue writer, I deeme it worth the labour, to adde that which the same Doctor hath in another place. These are his words: Hoc ego ingenuè denuò profiteor, talem esse meam conscientiam,

I againe professe freely my conscience to be such, that I cannot easily depart, either from the Doctrines of the auncient Fathers, or from their interpretations of the holy Scriptures: vnlesse I bee convicted and compelled therevnto, either with the manifest testimonies of holy Writ, or with necessarie consequences and manifest demonstrations. For so my conscience is at rest, and in this quiet of minde I desire to die. Out of which wordes, I note two things, both memorable and of great importance: wishing the gentle Reader, to marke them attentiuely. First, that    the auncient Fathers haue decreed according to the holy Scriptures, superioritie, among Ministers in the Church, and the degrees of Bishops, Arch-bishops, Primates, Metropolitans, Suffragans, and Patriarches. Secondly, that    this learned Doctor thinketh himselfe bound in conscience, to acknowledge, receiue, and obey such decrees and constitutions of the holy Fathers: and therefore earnestly desireth to ende his life in that beliefe.

                           Matth. 20. V. 25. ouer them, and they that are great, exercise authoritie ouer them. But it shall not be so among you: but whosoeuer will be great among you, let him be your seruant.
                  
                  
                     The Answere.
                     I answere, that these wordes of our Sauiour Christ, doe only condemne ambitious desire of rule and the tyrannicall v

                        ge thereof: but not simply all superioritie, and lawfull authoritie of one aboue an other. I proue it first because    
                        Christ saith not, the Lords of the Iewes, but the Lords of the Gentiles beare rule ouer them. As if hee had said: you may not haue that tyrannicall kind of gouernment, which



the gentiles vsed; nor such ambitious desire and sinister affection of rule, as was found among them. And therefore is it significantly said, (it shall not be so,) He saith not, it shal not be at all, but it shall not be so, as it was among the Gentiles. Secondly, bcause it is the frequent custome of the    holy Scriptures, to forbid things simply without exception: when it doth in deedes and true meaning prohibite onely the abuse and the inordinate desire and vsage of the same. Call no man your father vppon earth, (saith Christ

And by this meanes he taketh away enuie from the one sort, and arrogant pride from the other: as if hee should cry with a loude voyce, be not troubled (with passions of pride,) as contemptible persons. For they that seeke Primacie, doe dishonour themselues: not knowing, that by this meanes they doe abase themselues.

                     Fourthly, because the originall worde Catacurieuèin, doth plainly insinuate so much vnto vs. Aretius a very learned    writer, & a great patron of pure Religion, hath these words: Catacurieuèin. Est dominari cum aliena tyrannide:

                         Catexousiazein, in potestate violentèr tenere. The one Greek word is to beare rule tyrannically: so is the other Greeke word, to haue violent power ouer men. Erasmus, Musculus, and many other learned writers, are of the same opinion.
                     
                        Musculus hath these expresse wordes: Non est autem

                     We may not thinke, that Christ doth altogether forbid, that no christian shall be called father, or maister, or Lord; as if it were vnlawfull for children to call him father, that did beget them; or for Schollers to call him Maister who teacheth them; or for Seruants to call their Maisters Lords; seeing the holy Scripture commaundeth children to honour their Parents, and the Apostle also willeth Seruants to obey their Maisters, and when hee heard the keeper of the Prison call him, and Silas Maisters he did not rebuke him for the same; but so to bee called Father and Maister, as the Scribes and Pharises were called, hee vtterly forbiddeth in this place. First, they greatly desired to bee called Rabbi, and therefore the affection of such names is forbidden. Againe, they wished so to be called Rabbi, that GODS people should wholy depend vpon them, and in no respect denie or withstand their ordinances and Decrees. But to bee called Father or Maister in this sort and manner, agreeth to no mortall man.
                     For there is one onely true Father, which is GOD



himselfe, and one onely true Maister, which is Christ, vpon whose commaundements wee must so depend, that wee may in no case sweare to the wordes of any other man. Heere wee are sufficiently taught, in what sense Christ for bad his Disciples to bee called Rabbi, and Maisters, viz. As I saide, against the ambition of Primacie, and desire to rule, are these things spoken, (and not simply against Rule, Dominion, or Superioritie.) For otherwise, hee would haue saide; let none amongst you, bee greater then the rest. But nowe, when hee saith, hee that is the greatest of you, shall bee your Seruant, hee sheweth himselfe not to have saide, yee are all brethren, for that hee woulde haue them in all things to bee equall among themselues, but that they who excelled others in the gifts of GOD, might humble themselues to the seruice of others. Thus writeth this great learned Father, out of whose golden wordes, wee may gather euidently sundry necessarie documents, for a resolute and full aunswere to the precedent obiection. For first, hee affirmeth constantly, that Christ doth not simply prohibite Christians to bee called    
                        Rabbies or Maisters, but so as the Scribes and Pharises desired to bee called Maisters. Secondly, hee telleth vs, that Paul and Silas were well pleased to bee    called Maisters. Thirdly, hee auoucheth roundly, that CHRIST did not forbid Dominion, Rule, and Superioritie,    but onely ambition and greedie desire of bearing rule ouer others. Which his opinion, hee prooveth to bee grounded vpon Christs owne wordes. And doubtlesse, it is to bee admired, that any Learned 
                           Infra cap. 12. sect. 4. ex Pe. Marty.
                         man will holde the contrarie opinion. See Peter Martyrs opinion, and note it well. His expresse wordes shall bee set downe, when I come to speake of the churchdiscipline.
                     
                        
                        The Reply.
                        Maister Caluin and many other learned writers, alleage this Text against that superioritie, which the late Bishops of Rome doe challenge ouer other Ministers of the Church: which doubtlesse they could never truely doe, if one Bishop or Minister may be superiour to another.
                     
                     
                        The Answere.
                        I answere, that M. Caluin, and other learned men, doe truely alledge this Scripture, against the falsly challenged Primacie of the proude & arrogant Bishop of Rome. And yet for all that, it doth not prohibite the moderate and lawfull superioritie of one Minister ouer another: which is both necessarie for the peaceable managing of the Church, and hath euer beene vsed in the Church, as it is already prooved. For the Bishop of Romes superioritie, is so farre from heing moderate and lawfull: that it may truely be termed tyrannicall, and plaine diabolical. Because (as I haue proved at large in other discourses,) hee taketh vpon him to depose kings, to translate kingdomes, and in most brutish and savage manner, to tyrannize ouer mens soules and consciences, Idque iure divino, as hee beareth the world in hand.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                        The 2. Obiection.
                     
                     The names of Arch-bishops, Primates, and Patriarches, are proud names, disholy, prophane, and not to bee found in the holy Scriptures.
                  
                  
                     The Answere.
                     
                        I answere: First, that though the names be not expressed in holy writ, yet is the thing it selfe sufficiently conteined in the same, as is already proved.
                     
                        
Secondly, that the very names are so farre from being prophane and disholy; that the most zealovs Patrons of the Presbitery, doe allowe and approue the same for lawfull and holy, and to haue beene ordained of the holy Fathers for a godly end and purpose. Maister Caluins opinion is alreadie set downe, in this present chapter. Yet for better satisfaction of the Reader, let him heare what the same authour saith in an other place. These are his wordes; Quod duodecim vnum habuerint inter se qui omnes regeret, nihil mirum. 
                        
                           Caluin. libr. 4 intit. cap. 6 sect. 8. 
                        Hoc. n. fert natura, hoc hominum ingenium postulat, vt in quovis caetu etiamsi aequales sint omnes potestate, vnus tamen sit veluti moderator, in quem alij respiciant. Nulla est curia sine consule, nullus consessus indicum sine Praetore sen quaesitore, collegium nullum sine Praefecto, nulla sine magistro societas.
                     
                     That the twelue Apostles had one among them to gouerne the rest, it was no maruell. For nature requireth it, and the dispositiō of men will so haue it, that in euery company, though they be all equall in power, there be one as gouernour, by whom the rest may be directed. There is no Court without a Consull, no Senate without a Pretor, no Colledge without a Presidēt, no societie without a maister. Now it is euident, that neither Bishops nor Arch-bishops in our church of England, haue greater authoritie, then maister Caluin speaketh of in this place. For to say nothing of the dignitie of Consuls and Pretors, which was very great among the Romans; the maister of a Colledge, (as euery Scholler of Cambridge and Oxford can tell, (hath a perpetuall office; hee is chiefe gouernour of that societie, and all the members thereof owe obedience vnto him, as to their head; he hath authoritie to punish, and to see lawes executed within his Colledge, as Bishops, and Arch-bishops haue in their dioceses & prouinces. And most certaine it is, that no Arch-bishop in England hath that authoritie in his prouince, which the Consul had in Rome.

                     Maister Beza confesseth, that antiquitie vsed the names of Bishops and Arch-bishops, and willingly admitteth of



them as holy names. These are his expresse wordes; Nam quod pastores temporis progressu distincti sunt in metropolitas, episcopos, & quos nunc vocant curatos id est, singulis paraecijs prafectos, id minime factum est respectu ministerij verbi; sed potum habita ecclesiasticae iurisdictionis ac disciplinae ratione. Itaque quod attinet ad verbi praedicandi munus, & sacramentorum administrationē nullum est inter archiepiscopos, episcopos, & curatos discrimen. Omnes. n. tenentur suos greges eodē

                     For that in processe of time, pastors were distinguished into Metropolitans, (or Arch-bishops,) Bishops, and Curates; it was not done in respect of the Ministerie of the word, but in regard of ecclesiasticall iurisdictition and discipline. Therefore touching the office of Preaching and Ministration of the sacraments, there is no difference betwixt Arch-bishops, Bishops, and Curates. For they all are bound to feede their flockes with the same meate, and therfore are they called in the Scriptures by the common name of Pastors and Bishops. But how impudent are these men, which vnder colour of these holy names, glory in the succession of the Apostles and true Bishops? thus writeth master Beza, iumping, (as euery childe may see,) with that doctrine which I now defend. Yea, the same Beza affirmeth these degrees and names, to haue beene appointed by the auncient Church vpon a very good zeale. These are his wordes in an other place; Neque verò nos ignoramus, quammulia sint a veteribu

Neither are wee ignorant, how many cōstitutions the old fathers haue made concerning the seates of Bishops, Metropolitans, and Patris arches; and that vpon a very godly zeale, assigning to euery one his boundes and authoritie. Thus the Reader seeeth,



how Caluin, Beza, Bucer, Zanchius, and Hemingius, doe hold the same opinion, which I now defend.
                     
                        The Reply.
                        The Bishops, Arch-bishops, Patriarches, and such like, of which Beza, Caluin, the Councell of Nice, and other councels make mention, were not such as our Bishops in England, Prelates of the Garter, high Commissioners, Iustices of Peace, and Quorum.
                     
                     
                        The Answere.
                        I answere, First, that the same superioritie of one minister    ouer an other, was then in the olde Arch-bishops, Patriarches, and such like, which is this day in ours here in this land, yea, greater by one degree at the least, because England neuer had a Patriarch in it. Secondly, that Arch-bishops,    Primates, and Metropolitans, (which are all one in effect) had then the same iurisdiction in other countries, which 
                              See Hemingius in enchirid, Pag. 368 &. p. 372. &. p. 373. & infra. cap, 10. verba eius habentur. conc. Antioch. can. 9 our bishops haue this day in England. That is to say, a superiour charge and sollicitude, of all Churches within their prouinces. Which thing, (though it be alreadie prooued sufficiently to all well affected Readers,) may yet bee further confirmed, with such a plaine and manifest testimony of the auncient Councell of Antioch, (which was holden aboue a thousand and two hundred yeares agoe, as euery child may behold the truth thereof. These are the wordes, Persingulas regiones episcopos convenit nosse, Metropolitanum episcopum sollicitudinem totius provincia gerere. Propter quod ad metropolim omnes vndique, qui negotia videntur habere, concurrant. Vnde placuit eum & honore praece
                                 •
                              lere, & nihil amplius praeter eum caeteros episcopos agere, secundum antiquam a patrio bus nostris regulam constitutam, nisi ea tantùm quae ad suam diocaesim pertinent possessionesque. It is meete that the Bishops of euery countrie doe know, that the Metropolitan hath the charge of the whole prouince. For which respect, al the Bishops round about him, which haue any busines, must haue recourse vnto yt citie, (wher ye Arch-bishop or metropolitan



doth reside.) Wherefore we haue decreed, according to the auncient Law of our Fathers, both that he shal excel in honour, and also that all the other Bishops shall doe nothing at all without him, sauing those things onely, which appertaine to their owne diocesse and possessions. Thus decreeeth this auncient and famous Councell, out of which doctrine, I obserue these worthy lessons. First, that an Archbishop or Metropolitan had in old time, the charge of the    whole prouince. And consequently, that our Arch-bishops and Metropolitans in the English church, haue no new Ministerie, nor other authoritie; then was had and practised by the holy Fathers in auncient time, euen in the primitiue church. Secondly, that this authoritie of an Arch-bishop    to rule a whole prouince, was not first constituted by this Councel, (though it were of very great antiquitie,) but was receiued by an auncient rule from their forefathers. Thirdly, that all the Bishops of the prouince, must bee directed by the Metropolitan or Arch-bishop. Fourthly    that the other Bishops could doe nothing, without the authoritie    of the Arch-bishop; such things onely excepted, as pertained to their owne diocesse and possessions. Let thus much be graunted to our Bishops, (which good reason will affoord them,) and they will desire no more. But, because the testimonie of the best Patrons of the presbyterie, cannot but prevaile much in this controuersie, let vs heare the verdicts, of the chiefest Doctors herein. Maister Caluins testimonie is already knowne, touching the authoritie of Arch-bishops in forrein countries, but I wil alledge and set before the Readers eyes, his plaine testimonie for our Bishops heere in England. These are his owne wordes, in his Epistle to Arch-bishop Cranmer. Calvinus Cranmero 
                           
                              Caluin. epist. 127. 
                           Archiepiscopo Cantuariensi, S. D. sequitur; sūma est in te authoritas, quam non magis tibi honoris amplitudo conciliat, quàm concepta pridèm de tua prudentia & integritate opinio. Caluin to Cranmere the Arch-bishop of Canterburie, sendeth salutations. The supreame and highest authoritie resteth in your



selfe, which your great honour did not more procure, then the opinion lately conceiued of your prudence and integritie. The same Caluin in his Epistle to Doctor Grindall the Bishop of London hath these wordes; Quod tamen curam popularium nostrorum qui in praecipua episcopatus tui vrbe habitant, suscipere dignatus es, non solūm vt libertas illis daretur reginae beneficio dei purè invocandi, sed vt pastorem fidum hinc accerserent, nisi hac de causa me tibi obstrictum faterer, stullitiae & inhumaintatis essem damnandus. Yet that you haue vouchsafed to take care of our vulgar country-men, which reside in the chiefe citie of your bishopricke, not onely that by the Queenes fauour they might haue freedome to serue God aright, but that also they might call from hence a faithfull pastor; if I should not confesse my selfe bound vnto you herein, I might iustly bee condemned both of follie, and of nhumanitie.
                        Out of these wordes, I obserue these corollaries. Frst, that heecalleth the Bishop of Canterburie, Arch-bishop;    and consequently, that hee did not thinke the name, to bee either antichristian, or vnlawfull. Secondly, that hee    did acknowledge the chiefest authoritie, to be in the Archbishop; and consequently, superioritie to be among our ministers. Thirdly, that he granted one man to haue the charg    of many Churches; that is, the Bishop of London. For hee saith (in the chiefe citie of our Bishopricke.) and that it may appeare yet more euidently, that he graunteth the charge of a whole prouince to one onely Arch-bishop; I will alledge some part of that his Epistle, which he addressed to the Potent 
                              Caluin. ad seren. regem Poloniae, epist. 190. and mightie king of Polonia. Thus doth he write; Que admodum si hodie illustrissimo Poloniae regno vnus praeesset Archiepiscopus, non qui dominaretur in reliquos, velius ab illis ereptumsibi arrogaret; sed qui ordinis causa in synodis primum teneret locum, & sanctā inter collegas suos & fratres vnitatem foveret. Euen as if this day one Arch-bishop should be the president of the most honourable Kingdome of Polonia; not as one that should haue dominion ouer the rest,



or should challenge to himself the right taken from others; but as one who for order sake, should haue the chiefe place in synodes, and should preserue holy vnitie, among his sellowes and brethren. I he
                              •
                           e are the words of this great learned man who was the greatest and chiefest patrone of their presbiterie, & the first man in the world that set it abroach, and brought it into the Church. And yet doth he graunt plainly, as much as our Bishops will require. For hee graunteth, (as wee see,) that one Arch-bishop may haue a superioritie, ouer all other Bishops in the large kingdome of Polonia. The exception that he maketh, I willingly admit, and so will all our Bishops likewise doe. As who neither doe nor euer did, once make or giue the least signe of any such superioritie, ouer their fellowes and louing brethren. No, no, no such thing can truly be imputed to them. For with vs euery minister in his Parish, and euery Bishop in his Diocesse; hath the charge of their owne flockes and Parishes, to Preach the word, and to administer the Sacraments vnto them, in as ample and large manner, as Maister Caluin heere requireth. Which his wordes immediately 
                              Caluin. vbi supra. epist. 190. afore-going doe declare, beeing these. Vetus quidem ecclesia patriarchas instituit, & singulis etiam provineijs quosdam attribuit primatus, vt hoc concordiae vincu

Where wee see, or may see, if wee will; that Maister Caluin acknowledgeth the same superioritie, both in the auncient times of the Church, and more lately in the Arch-bishop of Polonia, which is this day giuen and allotted to the Arch-bishop of Canterburie, ouer the other Bishops and Ministers in England. Now, for aunswere to the other



part of the obiection, touching high Commissioners, Iustices of Peace and Quorum, I haue referued the next Chapter.

By practise, because I haue both heard and read, that maister Caluin and maister Beza were admitted to be Counsellours of the seate at Geneua, being thought sit men for that place. Who doubtlesse would neuer haue yeelded thereunto, if they had thought it a thing either vnlawfull in it selfe, or incompatible to their function. No, no, it is neither vngodly, nor yet vnseemely, for a Minister to come from the Pulpit, to the correction of vice, sinne, and wickednesse. But contrariwise, it is so godly, so comely, and so necessarie: that it euer hath beene vsuall, both in the Lawe of nature, in the Lawe of Moses, and in the Lawe of grace:



for First, in the lawe of nature, Melchisedech was both King and Priest. So reporteth holy Moses in his booke    of Genèsis, and Saint Paul to the Hebrewes. And Saint Hierome 
                  
                     In lege natura. Gen. 14. Hebr. 7. Hier. in trad. Hebr. in Genes. tom. 4. Fol 95. telleth vs, that all the eldest sonnes of the holy Patriarches, were both Kings and Priests. Aiunt hunc esse Sem filium Noe, & supputantes annos vitae ipsius, ostendunt eum ad Isaac vsque vixisse, omnesque primogenitos Noe, donec sacerdotio fungeretur Aaron, fuisse pontifices.
               
               The Hebrewes (saith Saint Hierome,) affirme this (Melchisadech) to bee Sem the sonne of Noah, and reckoning the yeeres of his life, they shewe vs that he liued vntill Isaac: and that all the first begotten of Noah, vntill Aarons Priest-hood began, were Bishops. Yea, whosoeuer will denie, that Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Iacob, and others, did rule ouer those who were committed to their charge, as wel in ecclesiasticall In lege Mosis. as ciuill causes, they may truly be said to knowe nothing in the scriptures.
               Secondly, in the Lawe of Moses, Moses himselfe    was both the ciuill Magistrate and a Priest. For Moses 
                  
                     Exod. 18. 13. Exod. 32. Vers. 27. Leuit. 8. Exod. 40. 1. Sam. 2. Vers. 11. &. Cap. 4 18. 1. Sam. 8. Act. 13. 21. 2. Paral. 19. Vers. 10. iudged the people from morning vnto euen. Hee put the Malefactors to death, who had committed Idolatry. Hee consecrated Aaron and his sonnes, and burnt sweet incense on the golden Altar.
               
                  Heli was both the high Priest, and iudge of the people, for the space of 40 yeares together.
               
                  Samuel likewise was both a Priest and iudge ouer the people, for the space of 30. yeares together. The good king Iosaphat made the Priests iudges, both in ecclesiastical and ciuil causes. And after the captiuitie of the Iewes, the Machabees, were rulers, aswel in ciuil as in ecclesiastical causes. Read the books of the Machabees, Iosephus, & Egesippus. and this truth will soone appeare. But what neede many words, in a case so cleere and euident? God himselfe made a general law, yt the priests & the ciuil magistrate shuld iontly determine, iudge and decide, all controuersies. These are



the expresse wordes of the Law; if there rise a matter too 
                     Deut. 17. v. 8. 9. hard for thee in iudgement, betweene boold and blood, betweene plea and plea, betweene plague and plague, in the matters of controuersie within thy gates: then shalt thou arise, and goe vnto the place, which the Lord thy God shall chuse. And thou shalt come to the Priestes of the Levites, & to the iudge that shall be in those dayes, and aske, and they shall shewe thee the sentence of iudgement. These wordes are so plaine, as all interpretation may be thought needlesse.   
               
               Thirdly, in the Gospell, and newe Testament, wee In lege gratiae. haue a pluralitie of examples in this behalfe. S. Paul, when he made his abode at Corinthus, with Aquila, and Prescilla, whom Claudius the Emperour had driuen from Rome: he 
                     Acts 18. v. 2. 3. wrought with his hands, being of the same craft with them, and made tents as they did.
               S. Augustine, thought it a thing so lawfull, for a Bishop to be iudge in causes Ecclesiasticall; that I wonder, how any man hearing or reading his owne words, can any longer stand in doubt thereof. Thus doth he write: Quis 
                  
                     August. de opere mon. cap. 29. tom. 1. Cor. 9. v. 7.

Tamen Dominum Iesum, in cuius nomine securus haec dico, testem invoco super animam meam, quoniam quantum attinet ad meum cōmodum multo mallem per singulos dies certis horis, quantum in bene moderatis monasterijs constitutum est aliquid manibus operari, & caeteras horas babere ad legendū & orandum aut aliquid de divinis litteris agendum liberas; quam tumultuosissimas perplexitates causar ūalienarum patide negotijs secularibus, vel iudicando dirimendis, vel interveniendo praecidendis; quibus nos molestijs idem affixit Apostolus, non vtique suo, sed eius qui in eo loqu

                  sumus. Omitto alias innumerabiles ecclesiasticas curas, quat for tasse nemo credit, nisi qui expertus est. Non ergo alligamui onera gravia, & humeris vestris imponimus, quae nos digito non attingimus: quandoquidem si officil nostri sarva ratione possemus, videt ille qui probat corda nostra, mallemus haee agere, quae vt agatis hortamur, quàm ea quae non agere cogimur.
               
               Who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruite thereof? who seedeth a flocke, and receiueth not of the milke of the flocke? Yet I call the Lord Iesus to witnesse vpon my soule, in whose name I boldly vtter these words: that touching mine owne commoditie, I had much rather euery day to worke some thing with mine hands, as it is appointed in well gouerned Monasteries, and to haue the houres free, to read, and to pray, and to doe some exercise in the holy Scriptures: then to suffer the tumultuous perplexities of other mens causes touching secular affaires, either in determining thē by iudging, or in cutting thē off by intreating: to which molestations the Apostle hath tyed vs, not by his own iudgemēt, but by his iudgement who spake in him; which troubles for al that himself did not vndergoe, because his course apostolicall had an other respect. Which labour notwithstanding we endure with consolation in the Lord, for the hope of eternall life, that we may bring forth fruit with patience, for we are seruants of the Church, and especially to the weaker members, how mean members so euer we are in the same bodie. I let passe innumerable other Ecclesiasticall cares, which perhaps none will beleeue, but he that hath tryed the same. We therfore doe not binde grieuous burdens together, and impose them on your shoulders, which we doe not touch with our finger: seeing we had rather do those things which we exhort you to do, then which we our selues are compelled to doe; if we could so doe with the discharge of our dutie, as knoweth God the searcher of our hearts. Thus discourseth this holy, auncient, and most learned Father. Out of whose doctrine, I obserue many golden, worthy, and very necessarie documents,



for the instruction of all indifferent Readers. First,    that he delt much in secular causes and affaires of the world. Secondly, that he had rather haue wrought with his hands,    and haue done much bodily labour in the monasterie; then to haue beene so tossed and turmoyled, in hearing and determining ciuill causes of his people. Thirdly, that he vsed    sometimes to ende matters by way of intreatie, as a friend: and sometime by absolute authoritie, as a Iudge. Let this point be well marked, because it is of great moment. Fourthly, that the Apostle had bound him so to    deale in secular affaires. Fiftly, that the Apostle did not    impose that secular charge vpon him, by his owne iudgement and authoritie: but by the counsell and iudgement of God himselfe, who spake in him. Which charge he proueth out of the Apostles doctrine, in the place and chapter quoted in my Margent. Sixtly, that S. Austin did vndergoe    the molestations of secular businesse, because hee hoped thereby to attaine eternall life. Seuenthly, that hee    could not doe his bounden dutie, vnlesse hee were sometimes occupied in deciding ciuill causes. So farre was this holy Father from their opinion, who more rashly then wisely, affirme it a damnable thing, and an Antichristian marke, for a Bishop to be a Iustice of Peace, or of Quorum: and yet cannot any learned writer be named, for the space of a thousand and two hundred yeares, who reputed not S. Austin for a very holy man, and a most graue & learned writer. Let all such persons therefore consider better of the matter, and either wilfully condemne that holy Father, and mighty pillar of Christes Church; or else let them henceforth be more sparing of such savage loquacitie, and approue the Christian and laudable offices of Iustice of Peace and Quorum, in the reuerend Fathers, the Lord Bishops of the English Church. For Saint Anstin was both a Lord bishop, and as it were a Iustice of Peace, as is apparant by that which is already said, since the beginning of this discourse.

Priests, declaring to the people what paines hee had taken many yeares for them, being greatly occupyed, molested, and troubled in their secular affaires, earnestly required of them for Christes sake, that now in his olde age they would bee content, that hee might commit some part of his secular care, vnto one Eradius, a yong man, but a vertuous Priest? to which request when the people had yeelded, Saint Austin added these wordes; Ergo fratres, quicquid est quod ad me perferebatur, adillū perferatur, vbi necessariu

Therefore brethren, whatsoeuer was wont to bee brought to my hearing, let it hence-foorth come to him and when he shall haue neede, I will not denie my counsel God forbid, I should with-drawe my helpe. By which words of this Holy father, it is most apparāt to euery child, that hee was very much encombred with secular busines, both in the foore-noone and in the after-noone; and yet for all that, he durst not wholy withdraw himselfe: no not with the consent of the people: least in so doing he should of fend God. And therefore he said; Absit, God forbid. Let the word (absit) be well remembred.
               Saint Epiphanus the Bishop of Salamina, a Citie of Cyprus, behaued himselfe so worthily and Christianly, while hee was occupied in politique and ciuill affaires, that is short time he became famous among many Nations.

For when hee executed his priestly function in a most populous and large citie, which was an hauen towne neere vnto the Sea; in a short space he was famous among all Nations, for his great vertues which he made vse of, while hee was busied with secular affaires. To the Citizens he became famous, because they knewe him familiarly, and had made good tryall of his holy life. To the Strangers, in that they beleeued the constant report of the Citizens. Loe, this auncient writer, holy Father, and learned Doctor, (who liued aboue one thousand two hundred yeares agoe,) was either a Iustice of Peace, when he was the Bishop of Cyprus; or else had some other ciuill office, equivalent to the same.
               
                  Dorotheus a vertuous and learned Priest of Antioch did serue the Emperour in ciuill affaires. Eusebins Caesariensis writeth of this auncient Priest (who liued more then one thousand three hundred yeares agoe,) in these wordes; Dorotheum dignitate sacerdotali tum Autiochiae donatum, 
                  
                     Euseb. lib. 7. cap. 26.

Erat honestis ac liberalibus parentibus prognatus, humanioris literaturae neutiquam expers; eunuchus reverànatus, vti illum imperator propter incredibilem eius naturam in suam familiam a sciverit & praefectura purpura tingendae, quae apud Tyrum est, honorificè donarit.
               
               We knowe Dorotheus a Priest of Antioch, an eloquent man in deede. He was very skilfull in the holy Scriptures; he had profited so in the Hebrew tongue, that he could perfectly vnderstand the Scriptures in Hebrew, hee was descended of honest and liberall parents, not vnseene in humane literature. He was indeede an Ennuch borne, so that the Emperour rauished with his excellent nature, receiued him into his Court, and gaue him an honourable charge to ouersee his house, where his purple was dyed at Tyrus.

               Neuerthelesse, wee doe not denie, that Bishops which are also Princes, may besides their authoritie ecclesiasticall, haue also politicall right and secular power, like as other Princes haue: right to commaund secular matters; authoritie to vse the sword; authoritie to choose and confirme Kinges and Emperours, & to constitute and administrate, other ciuill affaires, as also to compell their subiects to yeelde obedience to them in that behalfe. And therefore wee graunt, that their subiects must obey their civill commandes, which may be kept without offence of Gods law: and that not onely for feare, but also for conscience sake.
               The same Zanchius in an other place hath these wordes: Quis autem illis omninò obediendum esse, quo iure,

               And who cannot see it euidently proued, by the examples which I haue alledged, that they must bee obeyed vndoubtedly, whether they be by right, or no right created Princes. For why shall not subiects obey in things not against Christian pietie, the Princes of the Empire being also Arch-bishops, of Moguntia, Colen, and Trevers? it is doubtlesse the properietie of sedicious persons, not to yeelde obedience vnto them. And if these must bee obeyed, why not also the Bishop of Rome, in the same matters and for the same cause, of those that liue within his Empire? for there is the like reason of them all. Thus writeth the famous and great learned Doctor Zanchius. Out of whose resolution, I obserue these points, for the good of the gentle Reader.
               First, that Ecclesiasticall and Civill iurisdiction are    compatible, and may both be in one and the same subiect at once.
               Secondly, that Bishops which are also Princes, may    together with their Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, haue also secular power, and authoritie to vse the sword, and such like.
               Thirdly, that the people within their dominions    and liberties, are bound to obey them.
               Fourthly, that they must obey not onely for feare, but    euen for conscience-sake.
               Fiftly, that whosoeuer shall disobey such Bishops    and Arch-bishops, doe shewe themselues thereby to be seditious fellowes. To which I adde, that this doctine of this great learned man, (who was a most zealous



professour of Christes Gospell) doth flatly confound, and euen strike dead, pronouncing a sharpe vae vobis to all such, as shall obstinately refuse to obey our Bishops and Arch-byshops here in England. For whatsoeuer can be obiected against our Bishops, why wee shall not obey them: the same may be alledged against those Bishops, of which Zanchius speaketh in this place. Yea our Bishops, are as lawfully created Barons, and doe this day as lawfully enioy their temporall Baronries (for ought I know,) by the free donation of the Kings of this Realme of famous memorie, as doe the Bishops of Germanie. I therefore conclude, from a good foundation surely layd, that Bishops and Arch-bishops, aswell concerning their names and titles, as their authoritie, iurisdiction, and superioritie ouer other Ministers, are both lawfull, necessarie and agreeable to the practise of the Catholique Church in all Ages: and consequently, that none will or can denie the same, but such as are either wholy ignorant, in the auncient Councels, holy Fathers, and ecclesiasticall histories: 
                     Calvin in harmon. evangel. pag. 263. or else maliciously bent to speake against their owne knowledge, and wittingly and willingly to oppose them selues against the knowne truth. Yea, Maister Calvin graunteth freely, that hee which is Lorde of a Village or Citie, may exercise the office of teaching.
            
            
               
               CHAP. VII. Of the Churches authoritie, in things indifferent.
               
                  The first aphorisme, of things de facto altered in the Church.
                  
                     MAny things being in their owne nature indifferent, haue beene changed in the Church by her authoritie, as the circumstances of times, places, and persons did require. First, our Lord Iesus did celebrate the holy Communion and memoriall 
                        Mat. 26. V. 20. Mar. 14 v. 23. Luc. 22 v. 19. I. cor. II 23. exod. 12. 18. numb. 28. 17. luc. 22. 14 mar. 14. 18. mat. 26 v. 20 Iohn. 13. v. 14. 15. of his sacred passion, in the euening after Supper. Yet the Churches custome this day is and euer was, to celebrate the same in the morning before Dinner. Secondly, Christ did celebrate the same, vsing vnleauened bread therein, but the reformed Churches doe this day vse leauened bread without offēce in so doing. Thirdly, Christs Apostles receiued the blessed Eucharist fitting: but the custome of the Church hath euer beene, to receiue the same kneeling. And they that would seeme to haue most spiced consciences, will not sticke to receiue it standing or walking. Fourthly, Christ washed his Apostles feete, willing them to followe his example, and to wash one anothers feete. Fiftly, the Apostles made a solemne Decree, 
                        Act. 15. v. 29. affirming it to proceede from the holy Ghost, to abstaine from blood, & that which is strangled. And yet the church many yeares agoe, haue wholy altered that holy ordinance and Apostolicall constitution. Sixtly, Saint Paul, after hee had willed the Corinthyans, and vs in them, to be followers of him, euen as he was of Christ, telleth them and vs plainly, that euery man praying or Prophesing hauing any thing on his head, dishonoureth his head. And yet at this day, 
                        Vide infrà, Cap. 14. membro. 7. smalaccount is made therof. This point will be made more plaine, when I come to speake of the oath Ex officio.
                  
               
               
                  
                  The second Aphorisme, of things not expressed in the Scriptures, and yet decreed by the Church to be obserued and kept.
                  
                     IN the church of the Hebrewes, wee read of many approoued constitutions, for which there was no warrāt in the written word. First, King Salomon appointed a solemne festiuitie, for the dedication of the Temple, which continued for 1. Reg. 8. 2. par. 7. the space of seuen whole daies. Secondly, Queene Hester and Mordicai appointed the Iewes to keepe a solemne feast, for the remembrance of their happy deliuerāce from Hamans crueltie. Thirdly, the Machabees, Iudas and his brethren, ordained that the dedication of the Altar should be kept from yeare to yeare, by the space of

Fourthly, in the daies of Nehemiah the Captaine, and of Ezra the Priest, the Iewes were appointed to keepe the dedication of the wall at Hierusalem, with thankes-giuing, and with songes, Cymbals, Violes, and Harpes. Concerning which dedication instituted 
                        Ez. 616. Ne. he. 12. v. 27. by Iudas Machabaeus, Christ himself honoured it with his presence, and maister Caluin affordeth it this explication. Ac si diceres, innovationes; quia templum quod pollutum fuerat,

At which time, Christ was present after his maner in the Temple, that in so great a concurse of people, his



Preaching might haue the better effect. Yea, maister Caluin granteth that the Iewes instituted their Sanhe

                  This libertie the Church hath this day, as may appeare by the freedome in altering the Saboth-day. For, as I haue In my suruey proued at large, by the testimonie not onely of the ancient Fathers, but also of the best approued late writers, Philippus Melanction, Erasmus Roterodamus, Iohannes Caluinus, Petrus 
                     
                        Vide infrà, cap. 10. ex Bucero.
                      
                     Martyr, Pellicanus, Bullingerus, and Vrsinus, in my booke of Suruey; though it be constant & perpetuall, to haue one day in the weeke assigned for diuine seruice, that being the morall part of the Sabaoth and vnalterable; yet, whether this or that day ought to bee appointed for that purpose, it is a thing that respects the time, and may bee changed by the church. If any shal hold the contrary doctrine, he must perforce fall into flat iudaisme, & tye himselfe to the obseruāce of dayes, moneths & yeares, against the Apostolike doctrine For to be tied of necessitie to the time, is a flat Iewish 
                        Gal. 4. v. 10. superstition, & intrinsecally ceremonial; as all the aforenamed learned men: doe & will testifie with me. yet I neither wish, nor deeme it a thing conuenient, to change the Lords day or Saboath.
               
               
                  The third aphorisme of the rules which the Church must obserue, in all her constitutions, ordinances, and decrees.
                  
                     THe first rule, which the Church must obserue in her lawes, decrees, & constitutions, is this; viz. That shee prohibite nothing which God commandeth, neither cōmand Regula. any thing, which God prohibiteth. Ye shal Prima. put nothing to the word which I cōmand 
                        Deut. 4 2. you, neither shal ye take ought there-from. Take heed therfore, 
                        Deut. 5. 32. that yee doe as the Lord your God hath commanded you: turne not aside to the right hand, nor to the left. Let not this booke of the law depart out of thy mouth, but meditate therein day and night, that thou maiest obserue and 
                        Ios. 1. 8. doe according to all that is written therein.
                  
                     
The second rule is this; that the decrees and constitutions of the Church, bee not made a part of Gods worship, 
                        Regula. Secunda. Mat. 15. 9. Coloss. 2. V. 23. nor holden as necessary vnto saluation. For as our Sauiour saith, they worship him in vaine, who teach for Doctrines, the precepts of men. And therfore doth the Apostle condemne Ethelothrescêian all voluntarie worship deuised by man.
                  The third rule is this; that the decrees and constitutions Regulatertia. of the Church, be onely made of things indifferent, and for one of these three endes; viz. either for edification, or for decencie and comelinesse, or for order sake, and peaceable gouernment of the Church. Of these endes speaketh the Apostle, where he willeth all things to be done vnto edifying, and to be done decently, and orderly. These three Aphorismes 1. Cor. 14. v. 26. 40. seriously obserued, & duly pondered, all Ceremonies, Ordinances, Decrees, and Constitutions of our English Church, will find ready and sufficient approbation.
               
               
                  The Demonstration.
                  The corollarie and illation deduced out of the precedent Aphorismes may be made cleare and euident, by three inuincible and irrefragable reasons. Wherof the first is taken, from the authoritie of the holy Scriptures; the second, from the practise of the Catholique Church. The third, from the vniforme consent of best approued late Writers.
               
               
                  
                     The 1. reason drawne from the holy Scriptures.
                  
                  HOly Writt teacheth vs, that the Church De facto hath 
                        Vide infrà, cap 14 membro, 2. in resp. ad 2 obiect. ex Zuinglio.
                      altered many things, which Christ himselfe did both institute, and put in practise. That the Church ordained and Decreed many things, whereof the Scripture maketh no mention. And that the Church may make decrees, Lawes, ordinances, and constitutions, in all things Adiaphorois which are of their own nature indifferent; so the same



tend to edification, comelinesse, or peaceable gouernment of the Church. This reason is proued, throughout, all the 
                        Vide infrà, ca. 9. ex Calvino & Beza
                      precedent Aphorismes. And it will be more plaine, when I come to speake of the election of ministers.
               
               
                  
                     The 2. reason, drawne from the practise of the auncient Church.
                  
                  IF the gentle Reader shall call to minde, what I haue in this discourse alreadie set downe, out of the Decrees of 
                        Supra, cap. 4: 5. &. 6. the auncient and holy Councels; out of the holy Fathers, and best approoued late Writers; hee cannot rest doubtfull, or stagger any longer in this behalfe. Saint Austen writeth so grauely and so copiously of this matter, in many of his bookes extant in the world; as hee is well able to satisfie euery one, that will be perswaded with reason. In his Epistle to Ianuarius, (to omit all other his manifold testimonies,) he telleth vs, that yt Catholique Church by her freedome and authoritie, hath instituted certaine solemne feastes, of the passion, resurrectiō, ascension of Christ, 
                        Aug. in epist. ad Ianuar. epist. 118. vide Calu. lib. 4. instit. cap. 10. §. 19. and descending of the holy Ghost, to be yearely obserued throughout the Christian world. He addeth these most golden wordes; Nec disciplina vlla est in his melior graui prudentique christiano, quàm vt eo modo agat quo agere viderit ecclosiā ad quamcunque fortè devenerit. Quod. n. neque contra fidem, neque contra bonos mores iniungitur, indifferentèr est habendū et pro eorum inter quos vivitur societate servandum est.
                  
                  Neither can there be any better discipline in these matters for a graue and discrete christan, then to doe so as hee shall see that Church doe, to which hee hath occasion to come. For, that which is neither against faith, nor against good manners, may be indifferently obserued for their societie, amongst whom we doe conuerse. In the same Epistle the same holy Father telleth vs Saint Ambrose his iudgement, August vbisuprà. concerning the varietie of fasting. These are his



wordes; Cum Romā venio, ieiuno sabbato, cum hic sum, non ieiuno: sic etiam tu, ad quam sortè ecclesiam veneris, eius morem serva, si cuiquam non vis esse scandalo, nec quenquā tibi. Whē I 
                        Vide suprà cap. 5. §. 2. ex zanchio, & nota valdè.
                      come to Rome (saith Saint Ambrose,) I fast on Satterday; when I am here at Millan, I doe not fast. Euen so must you doe, when you come to any other Church, you must doe after the manner of that Church, if you will neither scandalize others, nor haue others to scandalize you. Heere is a most golden rule, how to behaue our selues in things indifferent. viz, to conforme our selues to the time, place, and persons, when, where, and with whom we doe conuerse. If our brethren would seriously ponder, and duly weigh this golden aduise of this holy Father, they would abandon all contention doubtlesse, about the signe of the Crosse, the Surplesse, and such like indifferent things; and for that dutie which they owe vnto the magistrate, whom they are bound to obey in all lawfull things, euen for conscience sake; they would conforme themselues to his lawes and 
                        Rom. 13. their brethren, and not to scandalize the whole Church as they doe.
                  To this graue testimonie of Saint Austen and Saint Ambrose, it shall suffice for the second reason, to adde this memorable obseruation, viz. that our brethren, who labour so busily to enforce vs violently, to receiue their newe discipline; are not able to make demonstration to vs, either out of the Scriptures, or generall Councels, or the holy fathers, 
                        Vide Caluin. & nota val d. lib. 4. instit cap 2. §. 11. or ecclesiasticall histories; that any Church in the Christian world, from two hundred yeares before the famous Councell of Nice, vntill maister Caluins daies that is, for the space of a thousand foure hundred yeares together to say nothing of former times, had either the same newe

                     discipline in practise, or any pastors made after their manner. Which if it cannot be done, they wil (I doubt not) after mature delibration had therein, confesse willingly and truly at least in their hearts; that in this Church of England, there



is this day a lawfull ministerie, consisting of lawfull Ministers and Bishops, according to the practise of the Church in all ages.
               
               
                  The third reason, drawne from the vniforme consent of best approued late writers.
                  MAister Caluin hath a very large and learned discourse 
                        Calu. libr. 4. instit. cap. 10. 5. 30. vide. Zanchiū in compend. ipsissima. n. habet verba. pag. 641. of this question, some part whereof shall suffice at this present. These are his wordes. Quia autem in externa disciplina & ceremonijs, non valuit sigillatim praescribere quid sequi debeamus, quod illud pendere a temporum conditione provideret, ne que iudicaret vnam seculis omnibus formam convenire, confugere hic oportet ad generales quas dedit regulas, vt ad ea

                  But because in externall discipline and ceremonies, hee would not particularly prescribe what wee ought to followe, 
                        Notato cap. 10. ex Bucero Zuinglie, Hemingio, nota valde.
                      because he foresaw that this depended vpon the state and condition of the time, and did not deeme one maner to be agreeable to all ages; here we must haue recourse to his generall rules giuen vs, and make triall by them of what things soeuer, the necessrie of the Church shall require for order and comelinesse. Lastly, because hee therefore deliuered nothing expressely, for that they are not necessarie to saluation, but must be applied diuersly to the benefit of the Church, as the manners of euery nation doe require, it shall therefore be convenient, as well to chaunge and abolish the olde ceremonies, as to institute newe, as the good of the Church shall require. I confesse freely that



we must not vse innouation, neither rashly, nor often, nor vpon light occasions. But what shall bee hurtfull or profitable, charitie shall best discerne; which if we shall suffer to rule vs, euery thing shall be well.

                  But I denie not, that the Apostles deliuered some traditions, which are not written. Yet I doe not grant, that they were either parts of doctrine, or necessary to saluatiō What were they then? doubtlesse, such as pertained to pollicy and order For we knowe, that euery Church hath her fredome and libertie, to institute and ordaine such a kind of pollicie (& discipline) as shall be thought meet & profitable for the same; because our Lord prescribed no certaine rule therein.

                      in that place, but did also malepertly condemne them. Such Morositie is a most noysome plague; when wee will make the manner and discipline of one onely Church, to be a generall rule for all. Thus writeth this learned Doctor. Out of whose wordes I may truly gather so much, as will euidently make good the question I have in hand.
                  For First, he telleth vs plainly, that the holy Apostle did    not set downe any certaine rule or lawe, concerning things indifferent.
                  Secondly, that hee lest that freedome and libertie to    the Church, and that for this ende and purpose; because



forsooth; he foresaw in his wisedome, that such things depended vpon the condition of times: and that one manner of discipline, was not conuenient to all places and persons. Thirdly, that euery Church may either chaunge her olde    ceremonies, or institute new, as the necessitie of the Church requireth. Fourthly, that charitie is the best rule to follow    herein: and that euery thing is lawfull, which is agreeable to the same. Which rule S. Augustine appointed before him, as I haue proued already. Fiftly, that the Church hath received    many vnwritten traditions, concerning the discipline, order, and government of the Church. Sixtly, that    it is free and lawfull for euery Church, to appoint, ordaine and constitute, that kind of pollicie, discipline, & government, which is most sit & profitable for the same. And the reason hereof is yeelded to be this; because our Lord Iesus hath prescribed no setled law therein, but hath left all indifferent things to the libertie of his Church. Seuenthly,    that there can no greater plague come to the Church, then to tye all Churches to one kinde of externall government. Zanchius teacheth the selfe same doctrine, euen in Zanch. vbi suprà. the same words.
                  
                     Petrus Martyr, after he hath distributed traditions into three orders, shewing one kinde to bee expressed in the Scriptures: an other plaine repugnant to the same; the third neither contrary to the word of GOD, neither necessarily affixed vnto it: addeth these expresse words: 
                        Martyr in 1. Cor. 1. 10.
                  
                  
                     Sunt nonnullae traditiones, quas neutras appellare libuit, quod verbo deinec adversentur, nec illinecessariò cohaereant, inquibus mos ecclesiae gerendus est, tribus interposit is cautionibus. Primùm videndum est, ne obtrudantur, quasidei cultus & deculiar is quaedam sanctimonia; quandcquidem potius recipiendae sunt adordinum conservandum, & civilem ecclesiae commoditatem,

                     suum ius de his medijs, vt quoadilla statuat, quicquid viderit magis adificationem credentium promovere. Consideretur demùm, saepiùs nimijs traditionibus & ceremonijs in immensum auct is populum Christi sic gravari, vt tantum non obruatur.
                  
                  There bee some traditions, which may bee termed uentrall or indifferent, for that they neither are against Gods word, neither doe they necessarily cohere with it. In which ceremonies, the Churches constitution must bee obeyed, if three cautions doe concurre. First, that they bee    not obtruded, as Gods worship, or peculiar holinesse; but as pertaining to order and the ciuill commoditie of the Church, and to comlinesse in divine actions: otherwise all things are sufficiently comprised in the holy Scriptures, which pertaine to holinesse and gods worship. Secondly,    we must beware, that they be not reputed so necessarie, that they cannot be chaunged, as the time requireth. Let the Church keepe her interest and libertie in these indifferent things, to appoint what shall be thought most necessarie to the edifying of the faithfull. Lastly, let it bee well remembred,    that the multitude of Ceremonies doth often so annoy the people, that they are almost vndone therewith.

                  Because the multitude is for the most part ignorant and intractable, and the greater part doth often times prevaile against the better; all things are not euen in a popular state lawfully appointed, committed to the vnbridled multitude, but certain Magistrates are appointed by the peoples consent, to guide, rule, and gouerne them. If this wisedome be required in wordly affaires, much more is a moderation to be had in those matters: in which men are altogether blinded. Neither is there any cause, why any man of sound iudgement shall exclaime, that in such matters, there is no place for pollicie; except hee can shewe this pollicie whereof I speake, to be repugnant to the word of GOD, which I am perswaded he can never doe. For we must not simply looke, what the Apostles did in ecclesiasticall pollicie and Church-gouernment, seeing there is so great varietie of circumstances, that a man cannot without preposterous zeale, reduce all things in all places and times to one 
                        Vide Bezam, cap. 5. Art. 17. and the same forme in doing things, which leadeth the right way to the same. Thus writeth Maister Beza, who hath many like periods to the like effect, which I omit in regard of brevitie.
                  Out of these words, I note first, that the Church is not    so strictly bound to the practise of the Apostles, that she must alwayes follow the same in these Adiaphorôis Secondly,    that the Church in things indifferent, hath The authoritie of the Church is very great. power to make any Lawes, which are not repugnant to the word of God. Which point I would haue the Reader to ponder seriously, because it is very emphaticall and of great moment. Thirdly, that all Churches cannot haue    one and and the same kind of government, because the circumstances of times, places, and persons, will not suffer it. Fourthly, that the Church in all the lawes and constitutions, must chiefly respect the peaceable government of the people.

                  Touching Rites and Ceremonies to bee obserued in the Church, the same pietie and edifying of the Church requireth, that wee contend not too biterly, as if it were for matters of great moment: but that euery Church haue her libertie therein, as we reade in Socrates and other ecclesiasticall writers, that it was the olde custome of the Church. Of which things in generall, we allow and embrace both the Epistles which Austin wrote to Ianuarius. For these things tend to the edification of the Church.
                  The same Zanchius in an other place, hath these words:

                  In the meane while wee blame not the Fathers, that for the diuers manner of dispensing the word and gouerning the Church, they haue also multiplyed diuers orders of Ministers; because they had libertie so to doe, as our selues also haue: and because it is euident, that they did that vpon honest causes, which pertained at that time, to order comelinesse, and edification of the Church. Thus writeth the most learned Doctor, Maister Zanchius; who (if I bee iudge,) was a man of as rare learning and profound iudgement, as euer was any in the Church. Out of whose words I of serue; First, that wee should not moue contention   


                     
in the Church, for any rites and Ceremonies in the same. Secondly, that euery Church hath her libertie therein,    to appoint what is best for her owne government. Thirdly, that the Church of olde time, did vse so to doe.    Fourthly, that Zanchius approueth S. Austins rule herein,    as M. Calvin did before him. Fiftly, that it was lawfull for    the auncient Church to appoint sundry orders of ministers; and the church this day hath the same authoritie. Sixtly,    that the causes and respects, for which the church may ordaine and make lawes in things indifferent, are either edification, order, or decencie; as I haue proved already at large.
               
               
                  The Corollarie of the Chapter.
                  FIrst, the church may chaunge Christs owne practise,    and that in Rites and ceremonies pertaining to the holy Sacraments. Secondly, the church may appoint solemne    feastes to be obserued: as Salomon did institute the dedication of the Temple for seuen dayes; Hester & Mordecai,

Thirdly, the Iewes instituted their Sanhedrim, after their    returne from their captivitie in Babylon. Fourthly, the    church by S. Austins iudgement may make any Lawes, which are neither against faith nor good manners. Fiftly,    the church (saith Maister Calvin,) hath authoritie left her in things indifferent, either to make newe lawes, or to cassiere and chaunge the old; so often as the necessitie of the church doth so require. Sixtly, the church receiued many vnwritten    traditions, concerning order and government of the 
                        Calvin. in 1. cor. 11. Church. Seuenthly, the church, saith Zanchius, hath authoritie to constitute moe orders of Ministers, when it is    for the good of the Church. Eightly, the church may make    any lawes, which are not repugnant to Gods word. So



saith M. Beza, telling vs plainly, that we must not so much respect what the Apostles did, as what the peace and good of the church requireth. Much other like matter, the same Beza, together with Calvin, Martyr, and Zanchius, haue deliuerd vnto vs: as may appeare by this present Chapter. I therefore conclude, that the authoritie, which this our our English church doth this day challenge vnto her, in her ri

They are not abashed to say for their vnchristian excuse; that no power vpon earth can appoint an holy-day, and that it is great superstition to obserue the same. But certes, none



that are well studied or read, either in the holy ecclesiasticall histories, or in generall Councels, or in the auncient Fathers, or in the best approued late writers, can ever without great blushing, avouch or defend that vntimely hatched doctrine, and vnsoundly conceived opinion.

                  The reformed churches in Helvetia, doe right well allow the feastes or holy dayes: of the Nativitie, resurrection, and such like.
                  If I should endevour my selfe to recount all that, which may easily be collected out of the auncient councels, & the holy-fathers, for the approbatiō & allowāce of holy-daies, after the custome at this day, & of auncient time vsed in this church of England: time would sooner faile me, then matter whereof to speake. I will in regard to brevitie, content my selfe onely with one or two testimonies of councels, as also of the graue, holy, auncient, & most learned father, S. Austin: & then proceed to the testimonie of late writers, because in this dispute, they whō it chiefly concerneth, either haue not seene or read the councels and the fathers, or else more rashly then wisely, contemne their degrees & iudgements, and without all rime & reason preferre their owne opinions before them. The councel holden at Granado, or Elebertine, aboue 1200. yeares ago, (such is the antiquitie of

holy-dayes in the Christian Church,) reputed the practise of the Church in former ages, to be of such force in that behalfe; that they deemed them Heritiques, that would not obediently yeeld vnto the same. These are the expresse words of the Elebertine Councel: Pravam institutionē emendari placuit, iuxta authoritatem scripturarum; vt cuncti diem 
                     
                        Concil. Elebert. can. 43. 
                     Pentecostes celebremus. Quod qui non fecerit, quasi novam haresim induxisse notetur.
                  
                  We haue decreed, that the depraved institution bee amended, according to the Scriptures: that wee may all keepe the day of Penticost, (and the feast of Whitsonday.) Which who soever shall refuse to doe; let him bee noted as one that hath brought a new heresie into the Church. Thus writeth this holy Councel, which for antiquitie sake ought to bee reuerenced, seeing Poperie long after that time had no footing in the Church. And yet (as we see by their Decrees) he was in those dayes to be holden for an heritique; that would appose himselfe against the Holydayes, then obserued by the Lawes and ordinances of the Church. For, no Scripture prescribeth vnto Christians, the observation of Pentecost, which wee call Whitsontide. For though the holy and auncient Councell, speake of amending according to the Scriptures; yet is it not that Councels meaning that the Scripture appointeth that festivitie to be observed in the Christian Church: but that it is therefore according to the Scripture, because the Scripture in generall termes, hath giuē authoritie to the Church, to make Lawes in all such indifferent things. Let this point neuer be forgotten.

                  The same holy father in another place, hath these words;

                        ere tractare. Sed quia nunc interposita est solennit as sanctorum dierum, quibus certas ex evangelio lectiones oportet in ecclesia recitars, quae ita sunt annuae vt aliae esse non possint; ordo ille quem susceperamus, necessitate paululum intermissus est non omissus.
                  
                  Your holinesse remembreth, that wee were wont to intreate vpon the Gospell of S. Iohn, according to the order of the lessons. But because at this time there is interposed the solemnitie of Saint-daies, vpon which daies certaine lessons taken out of the Gospel must be read, which are so yearely done, that they cannot be changed; that order which we had taken in hand, is through necessitie somewhat intermitted, but not omitted. For we also do solemnely Hac pracedunt latinè. celebrate, both the Lords day, and Easter, and all other festival daies of Christians. But because we vnderstand, to what end they are referred, wee doe not obserue times, but the things signified by the times.
                  Out of these wordes, I obserue first, that in S. Austens time, the Church obserued & kept many festivall or Saints    daies. Secondly, that the Church did allot speciall portions    and parts of the holy Scripture, to bee read vppon those Saints daies. Thirdly, that the Church obserued    those daies for signification; which is a point of great moment, 
                        Vide Aug. de ciuit. lib. 10. cap. 4. and therefore ought to be well remembred.
                  
                     
                     Matthias Flacius Illyricus, after he hath distributed the obseruation of times into foure orders; naturall, ciuill, ecclesiasticall, and superstitious, he addeth these wordes; Ecclesiastica, 
                     
                        Illyricus in. 4. cap. ad gal.
                      
                     quae etiam decoro & bono ordini servit; quò facit quoque dies dominica, & tempora precipuarum historiarū, aut factorum Christi quae prosunt ad aedificationem rudium; vt rectiùs meminerint, quando sit dominus natus, passus, & quando in coelum ascenderit ae de singulis illis historijs suo tempore tāto commodius instituantur, quod valdè rudium memoriae prodest.
                  
                  The ecclesiasticall is that, which serued for comelinesle and good order; as is also the Lords day, and other feasts, wherein we celebrate the memorie of the chiefe histories 
                        Vide infra, cap. 14. membro. 2. per. totum.
                      or Acts of Christ, which be profitable for the instruction of the simple; that they may the better remember, when the Lord was borne, when hee suffered, and when hee ascended vp into heauen, and bee more fitly taught in due time, concerning euery seuerall historie pertaining therevnto. In which place, the same learned Writer affirmeth, that obscruation onely to bee superstitious; when wee put a necessitie, worship, merite, or righteousnesse, in the obseruing of time.
                  Out of these wordes I obserue first, that the keeping of Saints-daies in the Church, serueth for order and comelinesse    in the gouernment of the Church. Secondly, that the obseruation of Saint-daies, is very profitable for the    instruction of the simple people. Which doctrine is agreeable to that, which Saint Austen deliuered afore Illyricus was borne. Thirdly, that seeing we put neither necessitie,    nor worship, nor merite, nor righteousnesse, in the obseruation of holy daies, our keeping of them, can no way be superstitious.
                  The reformed Churches in Germanie, in their Articles 
                        Confes. Augartic. 15. pag 6. In apolog. pag. 192. which they exhibited to the Emperour, doe allowe the festiuities of Saints and other holy daies. And the famous Doctor Philippus Melanthon, in his Apologie of the saide Articles, hath these wordes. Item, vt ordo & politia

                        •
                     ke. Which is it, that Epiphanius saith; that traditions were ordained for pollicie sake, viz. for to keepe order in the Church, and that that order might admonish the people, of the historie and benefits of Christ. Behold here, how all Writers agree one with another: affirming vniformely, that holy daies are lawfully ordained and kept in the Church: and that for signification sake, and instruction of the people.

                  Maister Budinger a famous Preacher of the Church of Tigwie, holdeth the selfe same opinion, both in his Decades, and in his commentarie vpon the Epistle to the Romanes. Where hee alloweth the keeping of the holy daies and festiuities, of the natiuitie, circumcision, and ascension; the feasts of the Virgin Marie, Iohn Baptist, and many others.
                  Maister Zanchius is consonant to the former Writers, 
                        Zanch de relig. pag 182. deliuering his opinion in these wordes: Post diem domini

Reliqui diebus provt quaeque ecclesia expedire indicaverit, sic etiam sacrum caetum convocet ad verbum, ad sacramenia, ad preces, ad collectas. Semper vero absit, omnis dierum superstitiosa observatio.
                  
                  Next after the Lords day, I cannot but like and allowe the sanctification of those daies also, in which the auncient



Church did celebrate the memorie, of the natiuitie of our Lord Iesus Christ, of the circumcision, passion, resurrection, ascension, and the comming downe of the holy Ghost vpon the Apostles. Vpon all other daies, as euery Church shall thinke it expedient, so let them call together the congregation, to Sermons, Sacraments, praiers, and collections. But euer all superstitious obseruation, must bee quite laide away.
                  Out of these wordes of this zealous Christian, and most learned Father, (whose authoritie, if I had nothing else to say, would weigh deepely with mine owne conscience,) I note first, that Zanchius doth highly reuerence the constitution of the Church, concerning holy-daies. Secondly, that euery Church hath free libertie to appoint such holy-daies, as are most conuenient for themselues. Thirdly, that no 
                        Caluin. in. 4. cap. ad gal. in 2. cap. ad colos. inst. lib. 2. cap. 8. s. 34. such constitution of daies is vnlawful, but that onely which tendeth to superstition. And maister Caluin himselfe agreeeth vnto Zanchius, in many places of his workes.
               
               
                  The second Aphorisme, of kneeling at the holy Communion.
                  
                     THeir opinion, who hold it vnlawfull to receiue the holy Communion, kneeling on their knees; seemeth to me so rediculous, senselesse, and voide of all Christian modestie; that I deeme it needlesse, to vse many words for the cōfutation therof. King Salomon the wisest King that 3. Reg. 4. v. 29. 2. par. 6.

For thus saith holy Writ of him, in that behalfe; When Salomon had made an ende of praying all his prayer and supplication vnto the Lord, he arose from before the Altar of the Lord, from kneeling on his knees, and stretching of his hands to heauen.

The question is, if it be such a tradition of man, as euery one may refuse and contemne the same, as he list. I answere, that it is so the traditiō

Secondly, that euery ordinaunce of the Church, which pertaineth to comelinesse, is a cōstitution divine. And consequently, that euery Ceremonie approved this day in the Church of England, is a divine tradition; and therefore must euery one reverently & obediently receiue Note well hi

For, no wise man can thinke, that yt is rather to be accoūted comely or vncomely which a few yonglings of late dayes haue esteemed so; thē that which was euer reputed so throughout the Christian world, of al learned men generally for 1000. yeeres together.

Marke the Euangelist, vntill a thousand and some hundred yeares were expired, and if no one learned writer can bee sound, for the space of so many hundred yeares, that will avouch any one Ceremonie in the Church of England this day vsed, as kneeling, the signe of the Crosse, the Surplesse, and such like, to bee an vncomely Ceremonie; then doubtlesse, such ceremonies by Maister Calvins doctrine, are grounded vpon Gods word,



and must bee obeyed, & receiued accordingly. I wish the Reader to marke these words of Maister Calvin: Dei est, quatenus pars est decori: It is of God, as it is a part of comelinesse. I wish I say, the Reader to marke them well: because they are of great importance, and doe proue them

                      for his excuse, that such a ceremony pertaineth not to comelinesse, which can never bee prooved till the worlds ende. For all antiquitie all Councels, all Fathers, all Histories, are of the contrarie opinion.
               
               
                  The third Aphorisme of the Surplesse and other apparrel of the Ministers.
                  
                     THat which is already said in the former Aphorisme, is a sufficient demonstration of this question, to all well affected Readers. Yet I am content to adde a word or two for the helpe of the simple vulgar sort.
                  Saint Iohn the Baptist did weare an vnwonted kinde of apparell, so to set foorth his extraordinarie Ministerie, and the rather to moue the people to enquire of his office. And no sound reason can be yeelded, why the same vse can not this day 
                        Mat. 3. Uerse. 4. be made of the distinct kinde of apparell in the Ministers of the Church.
                  
                     
                     Samuel the Prophet had a distinct kinde of apparell, from all the other people. For Saul was perswaded, that he 1. Sam. 28. whom the Witch had raised vp, was Samuel the Prophet. Which opinion, Saul conceiued onely vpon this ground, because the Witch named his attire. Yea, the Prophets were euer knowne from other men, by a distinct and peculiar kind of apparell. This to be so, the wordes of the Prophet 
                        Zach. 13. Vers. 4. 
                     Zacharie will declare, which are these; in that day shal the Prophets be ashamed euery one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they weare a rough garment to deceiue. The Glosse in the Geneva Bible, yeeldeth vs this exposition. They shall no more weare Prophets apparell, to make their doctrine seeme more holy.
                  Maister Caluin granteth freely, that the Prophets were distinguished from the people, by a peculiar kind of garment. 
                        Caluin. in zachar. cap. 13. 4. These are his expresse wordes; Haec summa est, non reprehendi in pseudoprophetis vestem ipsam, quemadmodū quidam parùm consideratè arripiunt hunc locum, vt damnent & vestes oblongas, & qui

                  This is the summe, that this kind of garment was not reproued in the false Prophets, as some men doe rashly wrest this place to condemne long gownes, and whatsoeuer else doth not please their way wardnesse.
                  The same Maister Caluin in an other place, hath these wordes-Sedex Z

                        tu plus gravitatis & modestiae, quā in vulgari, extarct. But by Zacharie it is apparant, that the Prophets were distinguished from the rest of the people, by a certaine kind of cloake. And it was not without reason that the doctors were so attired, that in their habite there might be more granitie and modestie, then in the vulgar people. Out of this doctrine thus deliuered by M. Caluin I obserue these worthy documēts First, that it is expediēt, y• the ministers be known by their apparel. 2. that they are way-ward fellowes, that speake against varietie of garmēts, in the ministers



and people. Thirdly, that there is grauitie, & modestie, & consequently comelinesse, in the apparrell of Ministers. This is a point of great importance, it may not bee Note this point well. forgotten. It is of such moment, that it striketh dead, and can neuer be answered.
                  S. Hieromie maketh this question plaine and cleere these

                  Furthermore, divine religion hath one habite in the ministerie, an other in common life and vse thus writeth S. Hieromie: whose wordes in both the places, (if they bee aptly ioyned together,) wil make it euident to euery indifferent Reader; that in S. Hieroms time which was aboue one thousand and two hundred years agoe,) the Ministers of the Church did weare a Surplesse. For, in the former place he affrmeth, that the Ministers of the Church did weare a white garment; and in the latter he saith, that they vsed one kinde of garment in the time of Gods divine seruice, an other in their common conversation.

                  It is avident, that our Lord Iesus Christ hath prescribed to vs in his word, the substance onely of the Ministerie, both of the word, and of the Sacraments; and hath permitted his Church to order all other things, concerning the decent and profitable administration of his mysteries. Wherevpon we celebrate the holy supper, neither at night, neither in private houses, neither sitting downe at the Table, nor with men onely, but touching the time, place, and habite of the bodie, either for celebrating or for receiuing the Holy supper: touching the admission of women vnto the Communion of the sacred Supper, and the manner of singing and praising God: touching apparrel also, & other things pertaining to externall comelinesse: I doubt not, but our Lord hath giuen free power to his Church, to order and dispose of those things, as euery Church shall iudge it to bee most profitable for her people, to support and increase reuerence toward all the holy mysteries of God. If therefore any Churches, vppon this libertie graunted by Christ, and for this ende of edifying Christes people, would haue their Ministers to vse in time of the holy Misteries, some speciall kinde of apparell: all superstition, levitie, & dissention or abuse being taken away: doubtles. I see not, how any man cā iustly condemne such a church of any sin in that behalfe, much lesse of communion with Antichrist. What if any Church with a pure and



holy consent of her children had such a custome, that everie one should vse a white vesture in time of the holy Supper, as the newly baptized ought in olde to doe? for, if any will contend, that yt libertie may not be granted to Christes Church, hee must doubtlesse confesse one of these: either that the Church hath no authoritie at all, to ordeine any thing touching the Lords Supper, whereof they haue not the expresse commandement of Christ, and so all Churches shall be condemned of impious audacitie, for all Churches obserue in the celebration of the holy Supper, both the time and place, and the attire of the body, and doe withall admit women to the holy Communion. Touching all the which, they haue not only no commandement of the Lord, but haue also a contrary example, for our Lord celebrated his Supper at night, not in the morning; in a private house, not in a publike place; sitting at the table with his Apopostles, and eating the Paschall, not standing; and so exibited the holy Communion. Yea, the women were excluded, whom he reputed among his most holy seruantes. Either that it can not be, that there bee any Churches, which our Lord doth so free from all suspition and the abusing of his good creatures, that to the pure all the creatures of God be good through right faith in his name, and pure in the vse of signification; which whosoeuer shall say, hee doubtlesse must therevpon denie that Christ our Lord is the deliuerer of all men from all vncleannesse, as hee promised to be. Either that the wicked can by their abuse so pollute the creatures of God, which are good of their owne nature, that no godly man can vse them to a godly ende; which saying is euidently, against the testimonie of the holy Ghost. Or certes, that Christians can not lawfully dispose of all creatures, to put them in minde of their maker, and of our selues, and of his benefits toward vs, and of our duties toward him: which maketh against that, which the holy Ghost teacheth euery where, for the acknowledgement and worship of God in all his works, and for the doing



of all things in the name of our Lord Iesus Christ, to the glory of his father.

                  Furthermore, to say, that these garments and vestures are so polluted by the abuse of Antichrist, that they may bee permitted to no Church, although such a Church did both worship Christ, and know the libertie of all things, it is to me doubtlesse a great scruple of conscience: neither do I know any Scripture, by which I may defend this condemnation of the good creature of God, that any rite becommeth Aaronical or Antichristian, it is not grounded in any of Gods creatures, in any vesture or garment, in any figure, in any colour, or in any worke of God: but in the minde and profession of them, who abuse the good creatures of God to wicked significations.

                      to the same effect. Out of whose wordes, I obserue,
                  First, that Christ hath onely prescribed in his word, the substance of his holy worship. Secondly, that hee hath    giuen power to his Church, to dispose and order all other    things, which concerne the decent and profitable governement and administration of his holy Mysteries. Thirdly,    that the Church may appoint her Ministers to weare speciall garments, euen in the time of the holy Ministerie. Fourthly, that such garments may bee ordained, for decencie    and for edification. Fiftly, that the vse of such garments,    cannot be condemned by any Text of Scripture:



nor yet they iustly accused of any sinne, who appoint them to be worne, Sixtly, that no abuse of man, Antichrist, or    the maister-divell of hell, can so pollute them, but they may this day be lawfully vsed of the faithfull. Seventhly,    that the Church may ordaine ceremonies, for honest and godly significations.

Bishops, of which S.

                  We answere, that albert as we thinke, these things are not well brought into the Church againe; yet seeing they be not wicked or euill of themselues, and of their owne nature, they seeme not to vs to be a matter of so great moment, that therefore either the Pastors should forsake the Ministerie, rather then weare them, or the sheepe want their publique forrage, rather then heare their pastors so at

Bishop of London, being demaunded, whether the Pastors ought rather to refuse the Ministerie then to weare caps &

                  I answere, that in my opinion they ought not to forsake the Church for cappes & garments, or for any like thing, which is indifferent of it selfe indeed. Thus writeth M. Beza, when his counsell and opinion was required, concerning the wearing of the surplesse, and other Ceremonies in our English Church. Out of whose words, I note; First, that    M. Beza did not fully vnderstand the state of our Church: which I gather by the word, (Revehuntur) are brought into the Church againe. Where indeed, if true information had beene giuen, (let them looke vnto it, that report to forren countries, so sinisterly of their Soveraigne and natiue coūtries) he would haue iudged better of the case. Secondly,    that the ministers ought not to refuse the ministerie, nor to make such cōtentiō, for the wearing of yt surples, & such like things. Thirdly, that the cappe, surples, & the like ceremonies    are things truly indifferēt of their own natures & in thēselues. Which point, if it be wel marked, wil make good

                      the vse of al ceremonies in our English church. To cōclude, M. Beza, in the end & closing vp of his Epistle, exhorteth our English brethren to obey the Q.

                  When temples Idoles, groues, and such like things, are by authoritie overthrowne, although it bee manifest, that when we doe that, we honour them not, but detest them; yet for all that, we may not therefore conuert them to our owne private vses onely and commoditie, that it may appeare that we destroy them for Religion-sake, and not for couetousnesse. But when they are not converted to our owne priuate vses, but into common vses, or to the honour of the true god; then that is done in them, which is done and brought to passe in them, which is wrought in men themselues, when of idolaters and wicked persons they are chaunged into true religion.

                  For we this day make no scrupulositie of conscience, to retaine still those Churches which were polluted with Idols: and to apply them to a better vse, because that which is added to the Lawe by way of consequence, doth not bind vs. I graunt willingly, that all those things which tend to the planting of superstition, ought to bee taken away, so that by precise vrging of that which is of it self indifferent, we be not in too much rigour superstitious. Thus writeth Maister Caluin.
                  
                  Out of these wordes of these two great learned Fathers, I note these worthy lessōs, First, that things superstitiously    abused, may be applied to the honour and seruice of God. Secondly, that things which were superstitiously vsed, may    after their application to a good and godly vse, be resembled to those persons, who of Idolaters are become good Christians. Thirdly, that God himselfe hath taught this to    be so, at two seuerall times in two distinct subiects. First, when he commaunded the wood of the groues, which had beene dedicated to the false Gods, to bee applied to his owne vse and sacrifice. Secondly, when he appointed, that the gold, siluer, and brasse, which had beene prophaned in Hiericho, should be brought into the treasurie of the Lord. Fourthly, that our owne practise doth approue the same to be lawfutl, while we retaine Temples abused by the Papists.    To which I adde, the keeping still of Bels, Pulpits, Wine, strong drinke, and good cheare. For all these haue beene, and this day are abused; not onely by the Papists, but euen by those who liue among vs, and professe themselues to be of vs. And therefore, if wee will reiect the one sort for abuse, wee must also reiect all the rest for the same 
                        Vide infra, cap. 10 ex Bucero.
                      respect. Vnlesse perhaps it be a sufficient answere, that our owne conceits neither grounded vpon authoritie nor reason, must teach vs what to doe in all respects.
                  
                     
                     The Reply.
                     Wine, strong Drinke, Bels, Pulpits, and the like, are things of necessarie vse, so are not Tippets, Caps, and Surplesses. Therefore the case is not like.
                  
                  
                     The Answere.
                     I answere: first, that we may liue without all those things, which in the prepositiō are holden for necessarie. Secondly,    that not onely maister Caluin and S. Austen speake indefinitely    and generally of all things abused, but the Brownists and Martinists doe in their refusal approue the same, viz. the things obiected are not necessarie, and therefore they meet in woods, fields, and odde corners. Thirdly, that    if the superstitious vse of a thing, doe so change the nature of the same thing, that it can neuer be wel vsed againe, then doubtlesse must we perforce reiect all things, which haue once bin prophaned and superstitiously vsed. Neither will it or can it serue our turne to say, this is necessarie, so is not that. For as the Apostle saith; Non sunt facienda mala, vt iude 
                        
                           Rom. 3. v. 8. 
                        eveniat bonum. Wee must not doe euill, that good may come thereupon. But if the thing before indifferent in it owne nature, doe stil remaine indifferent, notwithstanding the abuse, (as I haue alreadie proued it;) then may the lawful magistrate, and much more the Church with his authoritie 
                           Vide infra, cap 14. propofine.
                         and assent concurring, retaine stil some thing, & reiect other some, as it shall seeme most expedient, for the quiet and peaceable gouernment of the Church. For the Church hath free libertie and power to dispose of all things, which are Adiaphora, indifferent of their own nature.

                     It is against my conscience to weare a Surplesse, to make the signe of the Crosse in the childs forehead, and so forth. Ergo I may not doe it.
                  
                  
                     
                     The Answere.
                     True it is, that whosoeuer doth any thing against his consciēce, sinneth, though the thing he doth, be otherwise lawful to be done. Wherfore his onely remedie is this: either to reforme his erroneous conscience, or else peaceably, to giue place to the law, & not contentiously to withstand the law of his superiours, (to whō, vnder God he oweth obedience) and so to raise vp schisme & contention in the Church. But it is to be feared, that some pretend conscience, where onely pride beareth the sway. Because forsooth, they haue more rashly then wisely, Preached against the same ceremonies informer times?
                  
                  
                     
                        The 3. Reply.
                     
                     The reformed Churches in other countries, haue abolished such Popish ceremonies. Why therefore should we keepe them still in our Churches?
                  
                  
                     The Answere.
                     
                        I answere; 1. that as some other Churches haue reiected    some ceremonies, which we still retaine. Ô so haue we reiected    some ceremonies, which some other churches stil retaine. Secōdly, yt as other churches are not to be condemned for reiecting such ceremonies, seeing they be no essentiall parts of religiō, so neither ought our Church to be euil censured    for retaining thē; being things indifferēt in their own nature. Thirdly, that many things are conuenient for some places, persons, and times, which for all that are very preiudicial, and nothing beseeming nor befitting other persons, times, and places; many things good for one cōmon. weale, which are too too hurtfull for an other; many things conuenient for the gouernment of one Church, which would quite destroy the state and pollicie of an other. Euery Church therefore hath her freedome, power, and authoritie, in all things indifferent; to make constitute, and ordaine such lawes, as shal be thought most expedient for the good

                         thereof. This assertion is proued at large in the Seuenth Chapter, throughout all the Aphorismes therof. To which place I referie the reader, for better satisfaction in this behalfe.

                     The Answere.
                     I answere; first, with S. Austen in these wordes; Satis apparet, 
                        
                           Aug. in ep. 154. pag. 453. 
                        aut ipsos privatos vsus in talibus esse prohibitos, aut ne sic inde aliquid inferatur in domum vt honoretur Tunc n. est abominatio  
                          
                        & execratio, non cum talibus sacrilegijs honor apertissima destructione subvertitur. It appeareth sufficiently, that either priuate vses be forbidden in such things, or else that nothing should so be brought into thine house, that it be honoured. For then is it abomination and execration, not when together with the Idolatrie, the honour is also euidently ouer throwne. Secondly, that this was a politicall    Lawe, giuen onely to the Iewes for a time; and consequently, that wee Christians are not strictly bound to the same. The ignorance whereof, hath brought many into many grosse errors. I therefore note heere by the way, for the benefit of the well affected and thankfull Reader, that the Lawe of Moses was threefold. viz. ceremoniall, iudiciall, and morall; whereof the morall part doth this day onely remaine in force with vs Christians, as which is indeed the very Lawe of nature, imprinted in euery mans heart in his natiuitie, and so cannot be altered or changed. But the ceremoniall part was ordained, to prefigure the ministerie of Christ then to come; and the iudiciall part was semblably appointed, for the conseruation of iustice among the Iewes. And consequently, as they both pertained to that time and that people onely, so were they both expired by the aduent of our Lord Iesus. This Saint Paul teacheth to be



so; where he telleth vs, that the Priest-hood being translated, the Lawe must also of necessitie haue a change. Hence 
                           Hebr. 7. Vers. 12. commeth it first, that where one could not by that Law, be condemned vpon the testimonie of one man, but of two at    the least, hee may this day bee condemned lawfully vpon one mans oath, where the Lawe of the Realme doth so appoint. Where I cannot but greatly admire them, who seeme 
                           Deut. 19. Vers. 15. to condemne such Lawes, by vertue of the iudiciall Lawe of Moses. For the morall part onely being now in force, the other can haue no place. But the morall and naturall 
                           Vide infra, cap. 15. & notato.
                         part, (marke well my wordes,) doth onely require this, viz. that great care and circumspection be had in iudgement, and that none bee condemned vniustly. Touching the number of witnesses, the Lawe of nature is silent, and leaueth that point as Arbitrarie to the of man. Hence commeth it. Secondly, that blasphemers, adulterers, & such like    malefactors, are this day suffered to liue in many Christian kingdomes, and that thing is permitted, without any trangression of Gods lawe in that behalfe, For the Lawe of nature doth onely require this, viz. that sinne be so punished, as standeth best with the peaceable gouernment of the common-weale. Touching the quantitie and kind of punishment, it saith nothing at all. Hence commeth it. Thirdly, that the intailing of lands is lawfull this day among    Christians, although some haue more audaciously then wisely, auouched the contratie in open Pulpit. It is therefore most prudently and right Christianly prouided in the Cannos of Anno. 1604. that none shall bee permitted to Preach without Licence. Hence commeth it. Fourthly, that the true owners may for good causes and considerations    lawfully sell their landes and inheritance, and others lawfully buy the same, howsoeuer some without all testimonie of Scriptures, Councels, or Fathers, doe peremptorily Preach against the same. I will for charitie sake heere conceale, what to my griefe and the scandall of many, hath out of open Pulpit sounded in mine eares. Hence cōmeth



it fiftly, that Fathers may giue their lands lawfully to any of their children; either to the yongest, or to any of the rest,    or to the Church, Hospitals, kinstolkes, or meere stran, gers, so it be done for good respects, and godly considerations for the Law of nature requireth no more of Parents, concerning Goods, lands, and possessions, but this onely thing; that they bring vp all their children in true faith, holy feare, and humble obedience, and prouide competently for their honest mainteinance and sustentation. If any shal hold the contrarie, hee will giue occasion to set all the land together by the eares, Hence cōmeth it Sixtly that sundry    customes in this land; viz. where brethren inherite together as sisters at the common lawe, and the youngest sonne before the eldest, are not vnlawfull, the like may be saide of many other points in the iudiciall Lawe, and to this present obiection. For the naturall part of this iudiciall Lawe, doth onely require this of vs: viz. that we keepe our selues from Idolatry, and from doing any honour or worship to the same. Maister Caluin doth not dissent from this mine exposition, concerning the text alledged in the obiection. These are his expresse words, Quamvis autem politicum hoc fuerit praeceptum, & tantum veters populo ad tempus datum, ex co tamen colligimus quám detestabilis sit idolatria, quae ipsa etiam 
                        
                           Caluin, in. 7. deut. v. 25. 
                        dei opera sua soeditate inficit. Although this were a politicall precept, and giuen onely to the Iewes for a time, yet may we gather therof, how detestable a thing Idolatry is, which with the silth thereof infecteth the very workes of God. Loe, this precept was onely giuen to the Iewish people, and endured but for that time; and so, as it is iudicial, it doth not this day touch vs that be Christians at all.
                     Maister Musculus iumpeth with M. Caluin, for the truth of this question. These are his expresse wordes. Hactenus ostendimus abrogandam fuisse legem Mosaicam per adventum 
                        
                           Musculus de legib. Pag. 140. 
                        Christs, & nova legis introductionem, iam consequentèr videndū est, quatenus sit abrogat? Sequitur quaern̄t, an tota sit abrogata? respondemus; si totus Moses cessit Christo, vtique tota illius lex


                        
                        cessit legi Christi. Hitherto we haue shewed, that the Law of Moses must be abrogated by Christs aduent, & by the introduction of the new law. Now we haue to consider consequently, in what sort it is abrogated. The question is asked, if it be wholy abrogated, (or onely in part?) we answere, that seeing Moses himselfe gaue place wholy vnto Christ, the Lawe doubtlesse of Moses must likewise giue place wholy to the Law of Christ.
                  
                  
                     The Reply.
                     But maister Caluin saith plainly, that Idolatry infecteth the very workes of God with the filth thereof. Therefore things once applied to Popish superstition and Idolatrie, can neuer thenceforth be lawfully vsed.
                  
                  
                     The Answere.
                     
                        I haue proued alreadie, out of M. Caluins own wordes; 
                           Supra, in 1. Obiect.
                         that we may vse things lawfully, which haue bin abused to Idolatrie; as Temples, Pulpits, and such like. Neither doth maister Caluin say here, that such things are polluted in themselues; but that they are so called in respect of the people, so to terrifie them the more from Idolatry. For these are his wordes immediately going afore; Respondendum est, anrum vel argentum impio abusu minimè fuisse vitiatum, sed quamvis omns macula in se careret, populi respectu fuisse poliutum. Talis suit animalium immundities; non quod in se qui
                              •
                           quam baberent inquinamenti, sed quoniam deus eorum esu inter dixerat. I answere, that the gold or mony was not defiled with the impious abuse thereof; but albeit it was without all blemish in it selfe, yet in respect of the people it was polluted. Such was the vncleannesse of the beasts (in the lawe;) not for that they had any pollution in themselues, but because God had forbidden to eate them. Loe, M. Caluin granteth freely, that they are still indifferent in their owne nature, as they were afore.

                     There is no order in them, but confusion, no comelinesse, 
                           Vide infra, cap 8. per totum.
                         but deformitie; no obedience, but flat contempt of God and his word.
                  
                  
                     
                     The Answere.
                     I answere; first, that I haue alreadie proued sufficiently,    that there is grauitie, modesttie, and comelinesse, in the apparell of our Ministers, and that as well in their common life, as in the time of their ministration. Secondly, that it is    not euery priuate mans part to define, decide, and appoint; what is order and comelinesse in things in different, and the external gouernment of the Church, but that pertaineth to them onely, to whom God hath committed the managing of his house. Which point is likewise proued aboundantly in the Chapters aforegoing.
                  
               
               
                  
                     The 4. Aphorisme, of ceremonies vsed id Wed. locke or marriage.
                  
                  
                     IN the solemnization of Matrimonie, two things are much reproued; viz the Ring, and the simbolicall signification. To the former I answere, that seeing Wed-locke is a vassible ciuill contract, there is great reason, that it should be assured with some ciuill, permanent, and externall signe. Hereupon the Church, (which hath authoritie to ordaine ceremonies, as is alreadie proued,) doth appoint a round Ring, as a ceremonie best beseeming such a contract. For the Ring being round and without end in it selfe is very fit and meete to signifie to the married couple; that they ought to be ioyned in the perpetual band of loue, the one to the other.
                  To the latter I answere semblahly, that S. Paul may as iustly be reproued therein, as the Church of England. For 
                        Ephes. 5. after he hath discoursed at large, of the high misterie of matrimonie, assuming the husband and the wife to be one flesh; hee foorthwith addeth, that hee speaketh of the



great misterie betweene Christ and his Church. Which symbolicall signification. 
                        •

                     S. Chysostome S. Ambrose, S. Hierome, and many others. It shall suffice in this so cleere a case to alleage S. Ambrose his words for all the rest. Thus doth bee write; Mysterij Sacramentum grande in vnitate viri ac foeminae esse signifi
                           •
                        at, sed aliam causam quae non discordet a memorato mysterio flagitat, quam scit ad prosectum humani generis pertinere, hoc est ecclesiae & salvatoris: vt sicut relictis parentibus home vxori suae adhaerdt, it a & relicto omni errore ecclesia adhaereat & subijciatur capiti suo, quod est Christus.
                  
                  He signifieth, that there is a great mysterie, in the vnitie of the wife and her husband. Neither doth hee reveale this onely, but he also requireth an other cause, which differeth not from the said mysterie, which hee knoweth to appertaine to the profit of mankinde; that is of the Church and of our Saviour. That as man forsaking his parents,

                      adhaereth to his wife, so the Church leauing all errour, must adhaere and be subiect to her head, which is Christ.
                  
                  M Bucer, approveth and highly commendeth euery ceremonie, which our church vseth cōcerning holy wedlock.
                  
                     Hieronimus Zanchius a most zealous and learned writer, singeth the same song with Saint Ambrose. These are his words; Talis fuit eductio Evae ex latere Adae dormientis. Item, coniunctio Evae cum Adamo in matrimonium. Res in se fuit visibilis & sub sensum cadens, sed aliam occultam representabat, eductionem & creationem ecclesiae ex latere Christi in cruco mortui, & vnionem ecclesiae cum Christo.
                  Such was the eduction of Eve out of the side of Adam, when he was a sleepe. So also was the coniunction of Eve with Adam, in the matrimoniall contract, the thing in it selfe was visible and subiect to our sence; but it did represent another secret thing, euen the eduction and creation of the Church out of Christes side being dead vppon the Crosse, and the vnion of the Church with Christ.
               
               
                  
                  The fift Aphorisme, of the Symbolicall signe vsed in the confirmation of Children.
                  
                     IT is greatly disliked and highly reprooued, that our Bishops doe lay their hands vpon children, to certifie them by this signe of Gods fauour towards them. To which I answere, that the fact and vsage of our Bishops in confirming children, is according to the practise of the church in al former ages; and therefore ought it not, either to bee so lightly reiected, 
                        Eusebius lib. 6. Hist. cap. 35. or so rashly condemned. S. Cornelius, writing to his brother Fabius, sheweth evidently, how one Novatus being baptitized in his bed, regarded not after his recoverie the rest of the ceremonies, whereof he should haue bene partaker according to the rule of the Church; no, not so much as to be sealed or confirmed by the Bishop, & for that cause did he not receive the holy ghost. Now, this Cornelius liued above 
                        Cornelius vixit. An. 454. 1100. yeeres agoe, at what time the church was free from all herisies, errours, & superstition. And yet did the church even then vse to confirme children, in the selfe same maner now vsed in our English Church.
                  S. Augustin deliuereth the custome of the Church in his time, in such golden & excellent words; as I verely thinke he is able to satisfie every one, that shall with a single eye and vpright iudgement, all parcialitie set apart, duely ponder the same. These are his words; Numquid modo quibus impenitur

                  Is it this day expected, that they speake with tongues, vpon whō the Bishop hath laid his hands, that they should receiue the holy Ghost? or when we imposed hands, vpon Infants, did euery one of you marke, if they spake with tongues? and when he sawe they spake not with tongues, was then any of you so way wardly affected, as to say; they haue not receiued the holy Ghost; for if they had, they would speake with tongues, as it came then to passe. If therefore we haue not the testimonie of the presence of the holy Ghost by miracles, how knoweth euery one, that hee hath receiued the holy Ghost? Let him dispute the matter with his owne heart, and if he loue his brother, the spirit of God abideth in him. Thus write these holy Fathers, 
                        Vide infra, cap. 14. memb. 2. in fine ex Zuinglio.
                      shewing plainly vnto vs the practise of the Church in their dayes, and that the holy Ghost is giuen in confirmation; as also that the imposition of hands is a signe thereof in Gods children, though not giuen in such miraculous manner, as in the Apostles-time.
                  Saint Hieromie teacheth the selfe same doctrine, which Cornelius and Saint Austin haue deliuered. These are his words: Quod si hoc loco quaeris, quare in ecclesia baptizatus,

                     nisi per manus episcopi non accipiat spiritum sanctum, quem nos asserimus in vero baptismate tribui; disce hanc observationem ex ea authoritate descendere, quod post ascensum domini spiritus sanctus ad Apostolos descendit. Et multis in locis idem factitatum reperimus, ad honorem potiùs sacerdotij quàm ad legis necessitatem.
                  
                  If thou heere demaund, why hee that is baptized in the Church, receiueth not the holy Ghost but by the hands of the Bishop, which wee say is giuen in true baptisme; learne this observation to descend of that authoritie, because after our Lords ascention, the holy Ghost came downe vpon the Apostles. And wee finde the same observed in many places, rather for the honour of Priesthood, then for necessitie of the Law.
                  
                     
M. Bucer, that great learned Doctor, is very consonant 
                        Bucerus in 4. cap. ad Ephes.
                      to the auncient fathers herein. These are his expresse wordes; Signum impositionis manuum etiam episcopi soli praebebant, & non absque ratione. Sive n. sit foedus domini baptizatis confirmandum; Sive reconciliandiij, qui grauius peccarunt; Sive ecclesijs ministri ordinandi; haec omnia ministeria maximè decent eos, quibus summa ecelesiarum cura demandata est.
                  
                  The signe also of imposition of hands, was giuen by 
                        Uide infra, cap. 10 & nota resp. ad 2. obiect.
                      the Bishops onely, and that not without reason. For whether the baptized were to be confirmed with the couenant of the Lord: or they who had sinned grieuously, were to bee reconciled; or Ministers were to bee ordeyned vnto Churches: all these Ministeries doe especially pertaine vnto them, to whom the cheifest charge of the Church is committed. Thus writeth learned Bucer, shewing most evidently vnto all indifferent Readers: that imposition of hands in the confirmation of children, was an auncient and laudable ceremonie, and that it pertained onely to the Bishops to administer the same, and that vpon great reason. Let these words of M. Bucer, (& non absque ratione, and not without reason) be well marked, and neuer forgotten.
                  M. Fulke, a late famous writer, (who was a great fauourer 
                        Uide Ambros. de sacram. bibr. 3. cap. 2. of the Presbyterie, and of good credite with the chiefest Patrons thereof,) hath these expresse wordes: The auncient ceremonie of imposition of hands, which is nothing else (as S. Austin saith,) but prayer over a man to be strengthened & confirmed by the holy Ghost, or to receiue encrease of the gifts of the holy Ghost, (as S. Ambrose saith,) we do not in any wise mislike, but vse it our selues. Lo, this godly, zealous, and learned writer granteth freely, that confirmation is an auncient and godly Ceremonie: which to be so, he proveth out of S. Austin and S. Ambrose. Yea, he addeth the approbation of this Church of England reckoning himselfe for one of the number and members therof. We doe not (saith he,) in any wise mislike it, bvt vse it our selues. What then may we, or can we say or thinke, of

                           •
                        ? Who, either through ignorance of the practise of the auncient Churches, and for want of knowledge in the ecclesiasticall Histories and Councels; or else (which is farre worse,) vppon a singular Philautia, and fond admiration of their owne fansies and conceits; doe most arrogantly and rashly censure and condemne all others, both old and moderne writers, which will not embrace their phantasticall imaginations, and receiue the same as the decrees of the holy Ghost. Certes, I wonder, that they are not ashamed of themselues. For, it can with no reason bee denied; that God by the hartie and earnest prayers of his Church, doth worke those effects in those children which bee his, whereof the impositions of hands is a signe.
                  
                     The Reply.
                     The Church hath not authoritie to institute, either Sacraments, or sacramentall signes.
                  
                  
                     The Answere.
                     I answere; First, that our Church doth neither ordeine Sacraments, nor yet any sacramentall signes; but doth only explaine and declare the effect, purport, and true meaning 
                           Uide infrà cap. 14 & nota memb. 2. & 3. 2 of that signe, which the Apostles vsed in that behalfe. Secondly, that the Church hath power to ordeine Ceremonies in things indifferent, for edification, order, & comelinesse; and consequently, to expresse and declare the same by fit significant wordes. Which thing I haue proued at large in the seuenth Chapter, by the vnitorme testimonie of S. Ambrose, whose words are these: Accepisti post haec vestimenta candida, vt esset indicium quod exueris in volucrum peccatorum indueris innocentiae casta velamina.
                     
                     Afterward thou didst receiue a white vesture, to signifie that thou art deliuered from the snare of sinne, and art clad with the vaile of innocencie. Bucerus, Zuinglius, and Homingius, doe all 3. approue this custome of the Church.



Maister Bucer hath these words; Et hic admodùm commodus ritus esse videtur, si modo quid ista omnia significent, populo subinde explicetur. This also seemeth to bee a very fit Rite, Bucerus in censura minist

                           l. so the people bee sometime taught, what all these things do siginfie. Here he graunteth, that Ceremonies may be appointed for signification sake. Let this bee remembred well, and not forgotten.
                  
               
               
                  The sixt Aphorisme, of the signe of the Crosse, vsed in Baptisme.
                  
                     IT is a thing so cleare and euident by all ecclesiasticall Histories, that the heathen obiected to the Christians in reproch, that the God in whom they beleeued, was hanged on the Crosse; as none but either tootoo wilfull, or tootoo ignorant, will or can denie the same. In regard whereof the church in all ages, even in the Primitiue and Apostolique time, so to nourish and keepe among them the memorie of their redemption wrought vpon the Altar of the crosse, & to make it known to Iew Gentile, and all the world, that they were not ashamed of the true humilitie of their Saviour in that most ignominious kinde of death, which he voluntarie suffered for their sinnes; did institute, and ordaine the comely and most christian vsage of the signe of the Crosse, & that all christians in their first ordinarie and vsuall vnion with Christ by holy Baptisme, should receiue for that ende and purpose, the signe of the Crosse in their fore-heads. Herevpon the holy Fathers of best approved antiquitie, S. Cyprian. Saint Basill, S. Augustin, S. Hierome, S. Chrysostome, and all the rest, make mention of the like vsage of that most comely christian badge, every where in their most learned workes. Yea, the most holy and best learned fathers, doe proue the same vse out of holy Scriptures. Saint Cyprian hath these expresse words; Omnem autem super quem signum scriptum est, 
                     Cyprian ad ad Demetrianum, 
                           〈…〉
                        . 
                     ne tetigeritis. Quod autē sit hoc signum, & qua in parte corporis positum, manifestat alio in loco Deus, dicens; transi per mediam


                     
Hierusalem, & notabis signum super frontes virorum qui ingemunt & maerent ob iniquitates, quae fiunt in medio ipsorum.
                  
                  Euery one vpon whom the signe of the Crosse is made, shall be free and vntouched. And what signe this is, and in what part of the body it is made, God sheweth in another place, saying; Passe through the midst of Hierusalem, 
                     
                        Ezech. 9. Verse 4. Exod. 13. verse 12. Uide cundē Cyprian. libr. 4. epist 6 & make a signe vpon the fore-heads of them that mourne, and cry for all the abhominations that bee done in the middest thereof. In which place, the same holy Father and Martyr of Iesus Christ, proueth that signe to pertaine to the future passion of Christ Iesus, out of another place of holy writ. These are his wordes; Quod autem occiso agno praecedit in imagine, impletur in Christo secuta postmodum veritate.
                  
                  That which went before in figure, euen the Lambe which was slaine: is fulfilled in Christ, the veritie that followed after the same.
                  
                     S. Austin, in the disputation betwixt the Synagogue and 
                        Augst. de altere. eccles. & synagogae. tom. 6. pag. 57 the Church, alledgeth against the Iewes, this very Text of Ezechiel, for the confirmation of making the signe of the Crosse in the fore-heads of Christians. Vellem addiscere, vbi signum frontis acceperis, vel quis propheta signum istud quod dicis, hoc est, signū frontis signacuso sanctificationis inciderit. I would learne saith the Synagogue, where thou receiuedst the signe of the fore-hed, or which of the Prophets maketh mention 
                        Ezech. 9. v. 4. of that signe of which thou speakest, calling it the signe of sanctification in the fore-head. To this question S. Austin answereth in the person of the Church, prouing it out of the 9. of Ezechil as S. Cyprian had done afore him; as also out of the Reuelation, in the 14. Chapter, hee vseth an excellent and large discourse against the Synagogue; to which for brevitie-sake, I referre the Reader.
                  The same S Austin in an other place, hath these expresse 
                        August. in ps. 141. pag. 1125. words; Insultet ille Christo crucifixo, videam ego in frontibus regum crucē
                      Christi. Sequitur; vs
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         adeo de cruce nō erubesco, vt non in occulto loco habeā crucē
                      Christi, sed in fronte portem.
                  
                  Let the Pagan deride Christ crucified, but let mee beholde his Crosse in Kings fore-heads. I am so farre from



being ashamed of Christes Crosse, that I keepe it not in a secret place, but doe beare it in my fore-head. Marke well, gentle Reader, this godly period of this auncient, blessed, and learned Father.
                  S. Hierome in like manner proueth the lawfull making of 
                        Hier. in cap. 9. Ezech. tom. 5. the Crosse in the fore-heads of the Christians, out of the same words of the Prophet Ezechiel. Thus doth he write; Et vt ad nostra veniamus, antiquis hebraeorū literis quibus vs
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         hodiè vtuntur Samaritani, extrema Than litera crucis habet similitudinem, quae in Christianorum frontibus pingitur.
                  
                  And to come to our owne, in the olde Characters and Letters of the Hebrewes, which the Samaritanes vse to this day; the last Letter which is Than, hath the image or similitude of the Crosse, which is made in the fore-heads of Christians.
                  
                     S. Beda likewise gathereth the same conclusion, out of diuers 
                        Beda, in apo. calip. cap. 7. places of the scripture. These are his words; Ad hoc. n. gentium confractum est imperium, vt signo fidei cui restiterant, facies sanctorum liberè notaretur. Sequitur; ne
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         n. frustra in fronte pontificis nomen domini tetragrammaton scribebatur, uisi quia hoc est signum in fronte fidelium. For in this signe the dominion of the Gentiles was ouerthrowne, that the faces of Saints might be marked with the signe of Faith, which the Gentiles had resisted.
                  Thus write the auncient and holy Fathers; out of whose words, I obserue; First, that the making of the signe of the    Crosse in the fore-heads of christians, is grounded vpon the holy scripture. Secondly, that it was the custome of the    Church, to vse the signe of the crosse in their dayes; that is to say, aboue 1315. yeares agoe. To which I adde, that the same vsage was the custome of the church, in the time of Origen and of Tertullian; that is, almost 1400. yeares agoe. And no maruell, seeing it was an Apostolicall tradition. If any hold the contrary, let him name the time, and the Author; and if I cannot proue a further antiquitie, I will be of his opinion. Thirdly, that those holy Fathers,   


                     
(Saint Cyprian, Saint Austen, Saint Hierome. Saint Beda) did reioyce to beare the signe of the Crosse in their foreheads. Maister Bucer in censura graunteth the vse to be most ancient, and to be both comely and profitable. And consequently, that a Christian needeth not be ashamed now adaies, to beare the same badg in his forehead. If I should stand to recount the testimonies of the holy Fathers, for the confirmation of the lawfull vse and making of the signe of the Crosse; I should both wearie my selfe, and be tedious to the Reader. I will therefore conclude with the iudgement of Maister Zanchius, whose onely verdit me thinkes, should be sufficient in this behalfe. These are his expresse wordes. Alia vero traditiones non sunt necessariò retinendae in ecclesijs, etsi vetustae & a patribus commemoratae; 
                     
                        Zanchius in compendio, pag. 654. 
                     vt quod christianum oportet signo crucis frontem munire, diebus veneris & sabbathi ieiunare. Nam etsi servari possent, si absque superstitione exercerentur, tamen conscientiam non obligant. Sequitur summa igitur & conclusio haec sit, eas traditiones, quae dei verbo conformes, & ad vsum ecclesiae animosque hominum ad pietatem & verum dei cultum excitandos accommodatae sunt, 
                     
                        Ibidem, pag. 657. 
                     etiamnum retinendas & vsurpandas esse, citra tamen superstitionem & opinionem meriti.
                  
                  The Church is not bound of necessitie, to retaine still. Other traditions, although they be auncient, and mentioned 
                        Vide infra, cap. 10. ex Bucero, Zuinglio, & Hemingio, propè finem capit is.
                      by the Fathers: as that a Christiā must make the signe of the Crosse in his forehead, and fast vpon Friday and Saterday. For although these ceremonies and traditions might be still retained and kept, if that were done without superstition, yet for all that, they doe not bind a mans conscience to keepe them. Let this therefore be the summe and conclusion that such traditions as agree with the word of God, and serue for the Churches vse, and to stirre vp mens mindes to pietie and the true worship of God, may this day b
                        •
                      still retained and vsed, so it be done without superstition and opinion of merite. This is the conclusion of the most learned Doctor, Maister Zanchius, and I see no reason, why it should not be my conclusion also. And consequently, I doe constantly affirme with him, that the signe



of the Crosse may this day be vsed lawfully; so it be not 
                        Vide tu Hemingium, in syntagm in. 4 lege decalog
                              •
                           , & notate.
                      ioyned with superstition, and opinion of merite. Let this be well obserued; that Zanchius graunteth freely, that the signe of the Crosse may bee made, and that euen in the forehead. For, it is the very case now in question, and constantly affirmed by Zanchius; that it may bee well vsed, though it may also bee laide away. To which latter, both I and the Church of England doe willingly agree 
                        Vide infra. cap. 10. ex Bucero, & nota valdè.
                      with him. But withall I say, that seeing it is a ceremonie indifferent, and may lawfully bee vsed; it is not in the power of a priuate subiect, to appoint or commaund to lay it away; but peaceably, louingly, and obediently, to admit and receiue the same; knowing and euer 
                        Rom 13. Vers. 1 remembring, that in all things lawfull, higher powers must be obeyed.
               
            
            
               CHAP. IX. Of the Election of Ministers.
               
                  I Haue proued alreadie, that the church 
                     Supra, cap. 7. hath authoritie to make decrees, lawes, ordinances, and constitutions, in all things which are Adsaphora indifferent in their owne nature, and tend to the peaceable gouernment of the Church. for the church of God may safely admit, diuers formes and orders wherby it may bee gouerned; according to the diuersitie of the state thereof, and variable circumstances of times, places, and persons. The same libertie and freedome is granted to the Church, in the Election of her Ministers. This veritie may easily be proued, by foure reasons of great importance viz. By apostolicall practise, decrees of auncient Councels, the testimonie of the holy Fathers; and the consent of best approoued late Writers.
               
                  
                  The first Reason drawne from the practise of Christ and his Apostles.
                  CHrist himselfe, as his holy Gospell teacheth vs, did of 
                        Mat. 10. Uerse. 1. Luke. 10. Uerse. 1. himselfe alone without the consent and voices of his people, both call and choose his Apostles. And in like manner, himselfe alone did cal & choose his disciples, whō he sent abroad to Preach the Gospell, into euery citie and place, whither he himself should come. But most certain it is, that we are boūd to imitate Christs facts & deeds, before all other mens. For euery his action, is and ought to be our instruction. For this cause doth the Apostle exhort the E: 
                     
                        Ephes. 5. Uers. 1. 1. Cor. 11. 1. 
                     phesians and in them all other Christians, to be followers of God, as deare children. And the same Apostle willeth vs to be followers of him, euen as he followed Christ.
                  The Apostles themselues in their Elections of ministers, did not euer obserue one and the same manner. For, in one 
                        Act. 1. 26. place we reade, that they presented two, Barsabas & Matthias whereof the one was chosen by Lot. In an other place, 
                        Act. 6. 3. we find that this course was altered. For the people presented seuen to the Apostles, who all were chosen without Lots, & vpon whom the Apostles also laid on their hands. Wee reade in an other place, that this forme was like wise 
                        Act. 14. V. 23. changed, and that the Apostles Paul and Barnabas, ordained ministers in euery citie, in which ordaination they neither obserued casting of Lots, nor yet any presentment by the 1. Tim. 5. 2. tom. 1. v. 6. Tit. 1. 5. people. We find in an other place, that S. Paul Elected and ordained both Timothy and Titus, and gaue them authoritie to ordaine others. Hereupon I inferre this euident conclusion, that there is no certaine forme prescribed for the Election of ministers, which is to be obserued for euer in the Church, but that euery Church is free to change the same, according to the circumstances of times, places, and persons. Which doctrine wil better appeare, when I shal come to the fourth Reason.
               
               
                  
                  The second Reason drawne from the Decrees of auncient councels.
                  THe Councell of Laodicea, holden in the yeare of our 
                        Concil. Laodicen. can. 13. Lord 370. hath these wordes, Non est permittendum turbis electionem eorum facere, qui sunt ad sacerdotium promovends. The people may not be permitted, to haue the Election and choise of them, who are to be preferred, to the Ministerie of the Church.
                  The Councell of Cabilon hath these wordes. Si quis episcopus 
                     
                        Concil Cabilon. can. 10. 
                     de quacunque civilate fuerit defunctus, non ab alio nisia comprev
                           •
                        ncialibus, clero, & civibus suis, alterius habeatur electio. Sin autem huius ordinatio irrita habeatur. If any Bishop shall dye, of what citie soeuer he be, let not an other be chosen by any other, saue onely by the Citizens, Cleargie, and bishops of the same prouince, If it be done otherwise, 
                        Conc. autich. can. 19. the ordination shall be of no effect. The Councell of Antioch teacheth the selfe same Doctrine.
                  The councell of Nice, after it hath pronounced the Election of the people to be voide and of none effect, addeth 
                        Conc. 2. Nicen. can. 3. & nic. 1. can. 4. these wordes. Oportet. n. eum qui est promo vendus ad episcopatum, ab episcopis eligi. For, he that shall be made a Bishop, must be chosen of the Bishops. And this second Councell of Nice alledgeth the first Councell of Nice, vpon which they ground this their Decree. This reason therefore is consonant to the former, that there is no certaine prescript rule, for the Election of the Ministers of the Church.
               
               
                  The third Reason drawne from the Testimonie of the holy Fathers.
                  SAint Hierome in his Epistle to Evagrius, hath these expresse wordes: Nam & Alexandriae a Marco evangelista 
                     
                        Hierom. ad Evagr. tom. 3. Fol. 150. A. 
                     vsque ad Heraclam & Dionisium episcopos, presbiteri semper vnum ex so electum in excelsiori gradu collocatum, episcopum


                     
                     nominabant. For at Alexandria from Marke the Euangelist vntill the Bishops Heraclas and Dionisius, the pastorall 
                        Vide infra, cap. 14. memb. 2. & 3. per totum.
                      Elders did alwaies choose one among them, whom they placed in an higher degree, and called him Bishop. Marke these words well. Saint Hierome saith heere, that the Priests or Pastorall Elders did in Saint Markes time, (which was in the time of the Apostles,) choose one of themselues to be their Bishop. He maketh no mentiō at al, of any interest that the people had in that Election.
                  He that can and list, may reade in the Ecclesiasticall Histories, that when Anxentius the Arian was depriued of the Bishopricke of Millan, then Valentinianus the Emperour called the Bishops together, and willed them to place such a one in that Bishopricke, as was fit for the place. Which motion of the Emperour did no sooner sound in the eares of the Bishops, but they forthwith humbly requested the Emperour, that he himselfe would choose one whom hee thought most meete in that behalfe. Yet the Emperour both grauely, prudently, and most Christianly answered, that it were much better for them to choose one, for that they were best able to iudge and discerne, of his meetnesse for that place. In the ende, the good Emperour seeing the people tum

                  So soone as this dissention was knowne. Ambrose the gouernour of the Citie, fearing least they should

                     urch. The people beholding him made an end of their variance, and



all with one assent desired, that Ambrose not as yet Baptized with the holy Lauer, might bee designed their Bishop. Which when the Emperour heard, hee commaunded, that forthwith that worthy man should be Baptized, and then created their Bishop. Thus writeth this auncient and learned father.
                  Out of these wordes I obserue first; that in the time of    
                     Theodoret, (who liued almost 1200. yeares agoe) the people had voices in the Election of the Ministers of the Church. Secondly, that such vsage of popular Election,    was the cause of great tumults and sedition in the Church. Thirdly, that it was lawfull for the Bishops, to haue kept    the authoritie and interest of Election in themselues. Fourthly, that the confirmation of Bishops, was then in the    power of the Emperour. Fiftly, that it greatly skilleth not    who doe chose, so fit men be chosen for the places.
                  
                     Eusebius Caesariensis affirmeth constantly, that two 
                        Euseb. lib. 6. cap. 7. hist. eccles.
                      excellent Bishops in Palestine, Theoctistus Bishop of Caesarea, and Alexander Bishop of Hierusalem, did of themselues make the famous Doctor Origen Minister of the Church.

                  MAister Caluin, whose onely testimonie were sufficient in this dispute,) is so plaine and resolute, that whosoeuer shall with iudgement and indifferencie peruse his Doctrine, cannot but yeelde vnto mine opinion in this behalfe. These are his expresse wordes; Est quidem & il

                  This I confesse, was with very great reason decreed in



the councell of Laodicea, that the Election should not bee permitted to the common people. For it is very seldome or neuer seene, that so many heads can agree to conclude any matter well. Loe, this great learned man, (who was the greatest patron of the new discipline,) graunteth freely and roundly, that the Church may change the maner of election, and consequently, that no one certaine kind of election, is de iure diuino, decreed by Gods law to be perpetuall.
                  Againe in an other place, the same Doctor hath these wordes; Verum in caeteris consentanea fuit ipsorum observatio;

But in all the rest, their obseruation was agreeable to the discriptiō of the Apostle. And touching the third point, who ought to choose the Ministers, they did not alwaies obserue the same order. Loe, the maner of chusing 
                        Vide suprà, cap. 7 per totum.
                      the Ministers, was not the same in euery place, but varied according to the circumstances of times and places, as seemed best to euery Church.
                  Maister Beza is so plaine in this controuersie, (though he be deemed one of the chiefest patrons of the Presbyterie)

                  Because the multitude is for the most part ignorant and intractable, and the greater part doth often preuaile against the better; there cannot bee found euen a popular state lawfully appointed, where all things are commited to the vnruly multitude, but certaine magistrates are appointed by the consent of the people to rule them. If this prudence must be had in humane affaires, much more is a moderation required in those matters, wherein men are altogether blinded. Neither is there any cause why any man of sound iudgement should exclame, that in such a case there is no place for pollicie; vnlesse he can shewe this pollicie whereof I speake, to bee repugnant to the word of God, which I thinke he can neuer doe. For we must not alwaies looke, what the Apostles did in Church gouernment, seeing there is so great diuersitie of circumstances, that a man

                  Out of this Doctrine, which maister Beza hath freely deliuered to our consideration, I obserue these worthy documents; which I wish the gentle Reader, to keepe alwaies in his good remembrance. First, that the common    people are ignorant and intractable, and so vnfiit to beare any 
                        •
                     way in matters of great moment. Secondly, that in    worldly matters the vn
                        •
                     uly multitude are euer gouerned by others in euery well managed common-weale. Thirdly,    that a greater care must be had in Church-gouernment, and that the vulgar sort must haue lesse dealing therein. Fourthly, that no wise man will or can denie, that the   


                     
Church must vse great pollicie in these affaires. Fiftly, that    no private man may speake against the Churches pollicie, vnlesse hee can prooue the same to bee against the word of God. Sixtly, that the Church is not alwayes bound to follow    that in her pollicie and gouernment, which the Apostles did practise in their time. Which sixe points, if wee shall ponder them seriously; we can not but finde our English church gouernment, to bee agreable to Maister Bezas 
                     
                        Vide suprà cap. 7. doctrine. Who, I verely thinke, if he were here and did behold the same, would with applause subscribe therevnto.

                  Wherfore hence it commeth, that the Church hath power 
                        Vide cap. II. ex Musculo, & nota valdè
                      and commandement to choose Ministers. And this commission may be performed, either by the Church her selfe wholy or by some faithfull persons chosen by the Church, to this ende and purpose; as shall be thought more convenient, profitable, and sit for the peace of the Church, regard being had to the places, persons, and times. For all these things must bee referred to Saint Pauls rule, that all things may be done decently and in order. So Paul and Bernabas, choose Ministers in the Churches of Asia. So Titus choose Ministers in Creta, and Timotheus choose pastorall Elders at Ephesus. And these persons haue authoritie



so to doe, because the whole church hath chosen them there vnto; which by Gods word hath power and commission, to choose the ministers of the Church. Thus writeth this famous Doctor. Out of these wordes, I obserue these golden Lessons. First, that the authoritie to choose and elect    the ministers of the church, pertaineth vnto the whole church. Secondly, that the church hath this libertie and    power granted to her; either to choose them her self by general voices of all, or else to appoint some special persons for that ende and purpose. Thirdly, that the manner of electing    church-ministers may be chaunged, as the circumstances of times, persons, or places shall require. Fourthly, that    this varietie of election, is grounded vpon Gods word. Fiftly,    that Paul, Bernabas, Titus, and Timotheus, did of themselues choose the ministers of the church; and consequently, that the manner of electing church-ministers this day vsed in the church of England, is agreeable to the word of God, and also to the Apostolique practise of the Primitiue church. For our Bishops doe not exercise any authoritie at all, saue that onely, which the whole church assembled in Parliament, did by vniforme assent committed vnto them.
                  
                     The first Obiection.
                     S. Cyprian telleth vs, that the people haue interest in the Election of Ministers, which was giuen them by diuine 
                           Cypr. lib. 10 epist. 4. authoritie. Ergo, it is not in mans power, to take away that freedome from them.
                  
                  
                     The Answere.
                     I answere; First, that S. Cyprian meaneth nothing else by diuine authoritie, but divine examples; not any divine    precept, commanding it so to be done, Uiz. that there are examples in the Scripture, by which wee may learne, that the common people were present at the election of the Ministers, to giue testimonie to the church of their life and conuersation; as witnesses of their honest behauiour, not



as Iudges of the Election. This my answere is grounded vpon S. Cyprians owne words, which I proue sundry wayes. 
                           Num. 20. 1. v. 2. 7. Act. 1. act. 6. First, because he proueth his assertion onely by examples; viz. For that Eleazar, Matthias, & the 7. Deacons, were chosen in the sight & presence of the people. Now we know, that examples onely shew what may be done; but they are not a law, which doe or can commaund a thing of necessitie to bee done. Christ ministred the holy Eucharist after Supper, but wee doe it before dinner. The Apostles receiued it sitting but wee take it kneeling. Christ ministred it in vnleauened bread, but wee in bread that is leauened.
                     So we see a great disparitie, betwixt examples and precepts. The former doe instruct vs, but not compell vs; the 
                           Vide inferius, cap. 14. memb 2. & 3. & nota valdè. cap. totū.
                         latter doe not onely teach vs, but they also commaund vs. Againe because S. Cyprian, hath these words; Quod & ipsum videmus de divina authoritate descendere, vt sacerdos plebe praesente sub omnium oculis deligatur, & dignus at
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                            idoneus publico indicio ac testimonio comprobetur.
                     
                     Which thing wee see descends from diuine authoritie, that the Priest may bee chosen when the people are present, in the eyes of them all; that he may be proued worthy, by publique iudgement and testimonie. And a little after, he sheweth more plainly the cause, why the people are present at elections. Et Episcopus deligatur plebe praesente, quae singulorum vitam plenissimè novit. And that the Bishop may bee chosen in the presence of the people, who know best what euery mans life hath beene. Thirdly, because S. Cyprian confesseth in that very place, that some Prouinces had an other custome, whom hee reproueth not.
                     I answere secondly, that if the Antecedent bee admitted, and wee also graunt the peoples interest to be, De iure  
                          
                        divino; yet can nothing be inferred therevpon, against the practise of the Church of England. The reason is euident, because nothing is done in our Churches of England, to which the people haue not yeelded their assent, as is alreadie proued.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                        The 2. Obiection.
                     
                     The example of the Apostles, saith M. Calvin, is to vs Uice praecepti. Ergo, wee may not chaunge, or depart from their practise in any wise.
                  
                  
                     The Answere.
                     I answere; first, that I haue proued the contrary, both out of Maister Calvin and M. Beza: yea, M Calvin himselfe granteth freely, that Christes owne practise may bee chaunged: and that in a matter of greatest moment, euen in the blessed Eucharist. These are his owne words: Nihil a Christs consilio ac voluntate alienū facere videri, qui non contemptu neque temeritate sed ipsa necessitate adacti, provino aliua in ijs regionibus vsitatae potionis genus usurparent. Hoc domini

                         Analogon aliud symbolum ita cogente necessitate, vsurpare.
                     
                     M. Calvin (saith M. Beza,) answered to his brethren in America which haue no wine, that they should not doe contrary to Christes will and meaning, who not vpon contempt, but constrained with necessitie, would vse insteede of wine, some other kinde of drinke vsuall in that countery. Which counsell of M. Calvin our congregation did so well like, as grounded vppon good reason, and agreeable to Christes counsell, that we iudged them to be superstitious, which did so depend vpon the Symbole of wine, that they had rather omit the one part of the Supper, then to vse vpon necessitie, an other Symbole proportionable vnto wine. This was M. Calvins opinion, in this important and most weightie affaire.
                     M. Beza likewise deliuereth his iudgement, in another



subiect of like moment. These are his expresse words;
                     
                        Secundi generis sunt ipsa signorum materia, & nonnullorum r
                              •
                           uum a domino institutorum forma; vt exempti gratia, panis & vinum sunt caenae signa ex Domini institutione. Ubi igitur panis aut vini, vel nullus est vsus, vel nulla certo tempore copia, num caenae Domini nulla celebrabitur? Imò ritè celebrabitur, si quod panis aut vini vicem, vel ex vsu communi vel pro temporis ratione supplet, panis aut vini loco adhibeatur. Haec. n. mens fuit Christi, quum panem ac vinum ad haec mysteria deligeret, vt propositis earum rerum signis quibus corpus nostrum alitur, veram alimoniam spiritualem velut ob oculos representaret. Itaque a Christi sententi a nihil aberrat, qui nullo prorsus novandi studio pro pane & vino substituat, quae etsi non parem, similem tamen alimonia analogiam habeant. Desie etiam aqua & tamen baptismus alicuius differri cum adificatione non possit, nec debeat; ego certè quovis alio liquore, non minus ritè quam aqua baptizarim.
                     
                     Of the second kinde are the matter of the signes, and the forme of certaine Rites which our Lord ordained; as for examples sake, bread and wine, are the signes of the Supper, by our Lords owne institution. Where therefore there is either no vse at all of bread and wine, or else great want for a time, shall we celebrate no Supper of the Lord? Yea, it shall bee celebrated aright, if that bee taken in the place of bread and wine, which either by common vse, or in regard of the time, is vsed in the stead of bread or wine. For this Christ intended, when he chose bread and wine for these mysteries; that by proposing before our eyes, the signes of those things with which our bodies is nourished, he might represent the true foode of our soules. Therefore he swarueth not at all from Christes meaning, who hauing no desire of innovation, vseth in stead of bread and wine, those things, which though they haue not equall, yet haue they like proportion of nourishment with bread and wine. There wants also water, and yet Baptisme neither ought nor can be differed with edification; my selfe doubtlesse



would baptize in any other liquor, no lesse lawfully then I would in water. This is maister Bezaes iudgement, euen in the essentiall parts of the Sacraments.
                     Out of this doctrine thus deliuered by these two learned Doctors, M. Calvin, and M. Beza I observe these most important documents. First, that the authoritie of    the church is so great, that it can alter the matter of the Sacraments, both of Baptisme and the Lordes supper, if credit may be giuen to these great Doctors doctrine
                     Secondly, that the vse of the Lords Supper and of Baptisme    is of such necessitie, that this chaunge may and ought to be admitted, rather then wee bee defrauded of the benefite thereof.
                     Thirdly, that neither the practise of the Apostles, nor    the examples of Christ, nor yet Christes owne institution: No, not in the matter of Sacraments, is of such force and moment; but that the church vpon good and necessarie cause, may alter and chaunge the same. And consequently, it must needes be graunted, neither can it with any colour of reason bee denied; that the Church may chaunge the maner of choosing her ministers, as necessarie circumstances of times, places, and persons shall require. Especially, seeing there is neither example, commandement, or institution of Christ to the contrarie.
                  
               
            
            
               CHAP. X. Of the ordeining of Ministers, and the Ceremonies thereto apperteining.
               
                  THat Bishops haue and euer had authoritie, to make, order, and admit Ministers of the Church; it is so cleere and evident, by the Scriptures, Councels, Fathers and continuall practise of the Church, that I cannot but admire



their audatious temeritie, that doe oppugne the same. Marke well the answers, to all the Obiections in this Chapter.
               Saint Paul chargeth. Bishop Timothie, not to lay his 1. Tim. 5. V. 22. 2 tim. 1. 6. tit. 1. 5. hands rashly on any man. And the same Saint Paul telleth vs, that he left Bishop Titus at Creta, that he might order and make ministers in euery towne.
               Now, that Timothie and Titus ordained Ministers, it is cleere by the Text it selfe. But two doubts remaine;

               Touching the former, I haue prooued alreadie by many testimonies, that both Titus and Timotheus were Arch-bishops, and had superioritie ouer many other Bishops.
               I will heare adioyne the testimonie of Hemingius, 
                  
                     Hemingius in enchir. pag. 367. p. 372. p 367. p. 373. whose wordes are these: Attamen Paulus gradu digns tatis & ordine Timotheo & Tito erat superior. Timotheus gradu & ordine excelluit reliquos Ephesmae vrbis presbyteros. Et Titus Cretensihus praecrat. Sequitur, inter hos ministros agnoscit etiam ecclesia nostra gradus dignitatis & ordines, pro diversitate donorum, laborum magnitudine, ac v

                     cationum dignitate ac iudicat barbaricum esse, de ecclesia hunc ordinem tollere velle. Iudicat caeteros Ministros suis episcopis oportere obtemperare in omnibus, quod ad adificationem ecclesiae faciunt, iuxta verbum dei ac vtilem ecclesiae oeconomium. Iudicat episcoposius habere in caeteros ministros ecclesiae non despoticum sed patrium.
               
               But Paul in deegree and order of dignitie, was superiour to Timothie and Titus. Timothie in degree and order, excelled all other Presbyters or Priestes of Ephesus; and Titus was gouernour ouer the Cretions. Among these Ministers, our Church also acknowledgeth degrees of dignitie, & orders, according to the diuersitie of



giftes, labours, and calling: and deemeth him to bee a plain rudes be, that once hath but a minde to take this order out of the Church. Our Church also iudgeth, that all other Ministers must obey their Bishops, in all things which pertaine to edification, according to the word of God, and the profitable dispensation of the Church. Shee iudgeth that the Bishops haue a soueraigntie ouer all other Ministers of the Church; yet not despoticall, but paternall.
               Touching the latter, the scripture is plaine, that none 
                     Act. 1 act 6. act. 14 tit 1. 5. 2. tim. 1. 6. but Bishops did ordaine Church-ministers at any time. And these Fathers of the Church affirme cōstantly, that this was a speciall & knowne prerogative of Bishops; that they, and none but they, could order and make Ministers of the Church. S. Hierome hath these evident & expresse words; Quid enim facit excepta ordinatione Episcopus, quod presbyter 
                  
                     Hieron. epist. ad Evagr. tom 3. fol. 150 B.
                   
                  non faciat? For what doth a Bishop, which a Priest doth not, the ordering of Ministers excepted? Loe in this one thing, doth a Bishop differ from Priests and inferiour Ministers; because no other Minister, saue onely a Bishop, can ordaine and make Ministers of the Church.
               Saint Epiphanius, (who liued aboue one thousand and two hundred yeares agoe,) affirmeth plainly, that Bishops 
                     Epiph. cont. haer ab. 3. to 1. haer. 75. Pag. 296. onely make Priests, that is, begetteth fathers to the Church; and both he and Saint Austin enrolled the contrarie opinion among flat heresies, censuring all them for Heretiques, that held or defended such absurdities.
               Saint Irenaeus, (who liued next to the Apostles, and 
                     Irenaeus, lib. 3. cap 3. libr. 5. cap. 2. pag. 589. so could not bee ignorant, what was the Church practise in their dayes,) maketh this my doctrine without question, and beyond all exception; that Bishops euen in the Apostolique time, were different in degree from Priests, and did create and make Priests, but neuer were created of Priests.
               No, no: if Priests could make Priests: or if it were not an Apostolicall tradition, that that charge doth appertaine onely to Bishops, (as it is this day laubably obserued in



the Church of England, then doubtlesse. Aerius could neuer haue beene censured for an Heretique. Adde hereunto, that which I haue alreadie deliuered, in the fist Chapter, in the first and second Paragraph; and thou shalt finde this Doctrine, to be agreeable to the practise of Christs church in all former ages. See Zanchius, and note well his wordes. Note well also the Answere to the second Obiection.

                  The first Obiection.
                  It appeareth by Saint Hierome in his Epistle to Evagrius, that one minister was made superiour to an other, onely by the ordinance of men.
               
               
                  The Answere.
                  I answere; First, that Saint Hierome calleth that mans ordinance,    which was done by the Apostles immediately, for that they were men indeed, as we our selues are. Secondly,    that superiority of one Minister ouer and aboue an other, was in the Apostles time, and proceeded from authoritie apostolicall. This is alreadie proued. Thirdly, that a thing    may bee called de iure diuine, a diuine institution or ordinance, two waies. First, because it is of God immediately. Secondly, for that it is of them, who are so directed by Gods holy spirit, that they cannot erre. This phrase of speach, Saint Paul vseth in these wordes, to the remnant I 
                     1. Cor. 7. Vers. 12: speake, and not the Lord. Where we may not doubt, but all that Saint Paul spoke, was from the Lord, and that his ordinance was diuine, and not meere humane. And in this sense, the superioritie of Bishops ouer other inferiour Ministers of the Church, may bee called De iure diuine, or an ordinance diuine. Saint Hierome calleth it an humane ordinance, rather then Diuine; because it was De iure diuine onely in genere, and mediately, and De iure humano in specie, and immediately.
               
               
                  
                  The second Obiection
                  In the primitiue Church, there was neither Arch-bishop, Patriarke, nor Metropolitan, and yet no Church did or can excell the same, in gouernment, beautie, or perfection,
               
               
                  The Answere.
                  I answere; First, that though in the very beginning of    the primitiue Church, there were no Arch-bishops, Patriarches, or Metropolitans; yet were such very shortly after, euen in the time of the Apostles, as is alreadie proued. Secondly,    that though Arch-bishops, and Metropolitans were not expressely named, yet were they equivalently implyed in the Apostles. Thirdly, that as the Church for a    time wanted Arch-bishops and Bishops, so did it also want Deacons and vnpriested Elders. And as the defect of the latter, did not argue the imperfection of the Church for that time; so neither did the want of the former, inferre any such necessarie consequence. Fourthly, that as the Church    had authoritie, for the circumstances of times, places, and persons, to ordaine Deacons, and vnpriested Seniours, (if any such euer were,) so also had it then, and this day hath like authoritie to ordaine Arch-bishops, and other Ministers

                  Touching all other ceremonies, which were vsed of ancient time in the holy misteries, or are this day in vse with many; as fire to Exorcismes and Catechismos, the white garment of the Baptized, holy bread giuen to the Catechumenes, and many other things, my opinion is this, if there were any Churches, which retained pure doctrine and sincere discipline, and did vse these signes and ceremonies simplely and purely, without all superstition or leuitie, precisely to godly admonitions well vnderstood of all the people; I verily could not condemne those churches, for the vse of such signes or ceremonies. Hence it commeth, that as men doe in priuate and publique actions, so also may they adde many signes vnto their holy ceremonies, and that not without profit. The signe also of imposition of hands, was giuen by Bishops onely, and that Note well this point and doctrine, dels. uered by this great learned man. not without reason. For whether the baptized were to bee confirmed with the couenant of the Lord, or they, who had sinned grieuously, were to be reconciled, or Ministers were to be ordained vnto Churches, all these ministeries doe especially partaine vnto them, to whom the chiefest charge of the church is committed.
                  
                     
Out of these golden wordes of this great learned Doctor, and renowned Writer, I obserue these worthy lessons. First, that in the auncient approued Churches were many    Ministeries, with which inferiour Ministers (then called Priests, as our Church this day vseth the same names,) had not to doe withall. Secondly, that onely Bishops (who    were superiours in degree,) could make, order, and consecrate Priests, and other inferiour Ministers of the Church. Thirdly, that onely Bishops, and not Priests, did confirme    the baptized, by imposition of hands. Which thing our English Church doth this day lawdably obserue, howsoeuer some mal-contents, more rashly then wisely impugne the same. Fourthly, that the Church hath authoritie to constitute symbols, signes and ceremonies, and to adde them    vnto the holy misteries. Fiftly, that we may not condemne    those Churches, which for godly considerations without superstition, doe vse such signes and ceremonies, as were not knowne or heard of in the primitiue Church. Oh that this doctrine were well marked, and remembred; for then doubtlesse all dissention would cease, and all mal-contents would yeeld obedience, to the godly settled Lawes of our English Church.
                  Maister Zuinglius a very learned and famous Writer, and a most zealous professor of Christs Gospell, is able to 
                        Zuinglius in eccles. pag. 48 satisfie all indifferent Readers. These are his expresse wordes: Simul & illud notari debet, quod apostolorum nomen deposuerunt, vt primùm vni alicui ecclesiae affixi, illius curam continuam habuerant, cum nimirum vel senecta impediti, vel morbis afflicti, peregrinationum molestijs & periculis amplius, sufficere non potuerunt. Tunc. n. non apostoli amplius, sed episcopi dicti sunt. Possumus autem huins rei exemplum, imo testem adducere D. Iacobum, quem nos minorem ab atate dicimus. Hunc. n. Huronimus & omnes simul vetusti patres, Hierosolymitanorum episcopum nominant, non aliam ob causam, quam quod ea in vrbe sedem fixam posuisset. Cum, n. antea, vt & reliqui apostoli, peregrinationibus deditus fidem vbique terrarum docuisset, tandem


                     
                     abipsis apostolis constitutus est, qui Hierosolymitanae ecclesiae curā, ceu diligens aliquis speculator, ageret: idem de Iohanne euangelista & christi discipulo dicere possumus. Cùm. n. multis & varijs periculis obiectus apostolieam functionem longo tempore administravisset, tandem Ephesiorum episcopus factus, in ea vrbe anno ab ascensione domini sexagesimo octavo è vivis excessit.
                  
                  This also must be marked, that they laid away the name of Apostles, so soone as they were tyed to any one church, and had the continuall charge thereof. To wit, when they being either hindered with old age, or afflicted with diseases, were no longer able to endure troubles and molestations of trauaile. For then they were no longer called Apostles, but Bishops. We may bring Saint Iames the yonger, for an example, or rather for a witnesse of this matter. For Hierome and all the auncient Fathers, call him the Bishop of Hierusalem; and for no other cause, saue onely that he had placed himselfe in that citie. For when in former times, hee as the rest of the Apostles, being giuen to peregrination, had taught the faith euery where, the Apostles made him, as a diligent watchman, the Bishop of Hierusalem. The same we may say of Saint Iohn the Euangelist, and disciple of Christ. For when he being exposed to many dangers, had executed the apostolicall function a long time, hee was at length made the Bishop of Ephesus, and died 68, yeares after our Lords ascension.
                  Out of these words of this excellēt discourse, I note first,    that in the Apostles something was extraordinarie and temporarie, and something likewise ordinarie and perpetuall. This is an obseruation of great moment, well worthy to be engrauen in Marble, with a Penne of Gold. Secondly,    that the Apostles were some time Bishops, and that their function in that respect was perpetuall. Thirdly, that    so soone as they betooke themselues to an ordinarie calling, Note this point wel
                           •
                         for it is of great moment. they ceased to bee called Apostles, and were named Bishops. And this their ordinarie calling, remaineth this day in the Church, and shall continue vntill the



worlds ende. Hence commeth it, that all the holy Fathers affirme with vniforme consent, that Bishops this day succeede the Apostles in their ordinarily calling.
                  This graue Writer deliuereth his opinion for ceremonies, 
                        Zuinglius in acclesiaste, pag. 20. most plainly and prudently in these expresse wordes; Iam obijciebant odiose nimis, salem, butyrum, salivam, lutum, & alia id genus, imo ipsas quoque orationes quae super infantibus fiunt, quod neque Iohannes, neque apostoli legerentur orationibus baptismo praeivisse. Ad quae sic respondimus, primùm ad ceremonias; Christum interim caecos quosdam visui restituisse mediantibus tactu aut luto, interim solo verbo (respice,) neque tamen eos minùs vidisse, qui tactu vel luto mediante aciem recepissent, quàm qui solo verbo, at nihil morari nos externa ista, si ecclesia iubeat res

Now they obiected too odiously, Butter, Salt, spittle, Cley, and such; like, yea the very praiers made ouer infants, because neither Iohn, nor the Apostles are read, to haue preuented baptisme with prayers. To which wee answered, and first to the ceremonies, that Christ sometime cured the blinde by touching and Clay, sometime by his word onely, neither for all that did they see lesse, who receiued sight by Clay and touching, then they which sawe by his onely word: but we make no reckoning of these externall things, if the church command them to be taken away, and wee obe

                     ed, as shee appointed, albeit wee ministers are not ignorant, that in the beginning of the church these ceremonies were vsed, though not in such sort as now adaies, and therfore without contradiction we reiect them.
                  Out of this dicourse we may learne sufficiently, howe to behaue our selues touching ceremonies. viz. to vse or refuse signes and ceremonies, as beeing thinges indifferent, as the church shall thinke it expedient and appoint to be done.
                  
                     
                     Hemingius an other famous late writer, hath these words; Augustinus & Ambrosius non offenduntur, ex coque aliae Remae, 
                     
                        Hemingius in syntagm. in. 4. lege decalogi.
                      
                     aliae Mediolani essent ceremoniae. Nam inter se iunguntur pij spiritis Christi, non humanis ceremonijs. Vt pios gubernatores ecclesiarum velim magno studio cavere, ne ceremoniae scandalo sint infirmis; it a privatos nolim quicquam mutare in ceremonijs, gravi authoritate a maioribus institutis & approbatis. Neque est, quod exactissima ratio singularum ceremoniarum inquiratur, modo non manifestam superstitionem & impietatem redoleant. Quidam offenduntur ceremonijs nostris, quas clamitant papisticas esse. Dicunt nos habere sacerdotes, altaria, vectes, candelos, imagines, exorcismos, signationes crucis, planè papistico more. His ego respondeo, ecclesiam veram a falsae dictingunendam doctrina & cultu, non ceremonijs quae per se adiaphorae sunt. Neque. n ceremonias adiaphoras tanti momenti esse indicamus, vt propter illas schismata moveantur in ecclesia. Retineatur doctrinae sinceritas, retineatur purus dei cultus. Alia serviant partim tranquillitati, partim infirmitati hominum; & relinquamus prudentia quberuatorum, & de his rebus dispiciant.
                  
                  
                     Austen and Ambrose are not offended, that Rome had one kind of ceremonies, and Millan an other. For the godly are lincked together by the spirit of Christ, not by humane ceremonies. As I wish the godly gouernours of Churches to be very circumspect, that ceremonies doe not scandalize weakelings, so would I not haue priuate persons to alter 
                        Vide suprá, cap. 9. per totum, & infrà, cap. 14 any thing in ceremonies, which our auncestors with graue authoritie haue ordained & approued. Neither is there any cause, why we should require an exact reason of euery ceremonie, so that they imply not any manifest superstition and impietie. Some are offended with our ceremonies, crying out that they are papisticall. They say, we haue Priests, Alters, Vestures, Candels, Images, Exorcismes, Crossings, euen after the Popish manner. To these good fellowes I aunswere, that the true Church is distinguished from



the false, in doctrine and worship; but not in ceremonies, which are of their owne nature things indifferent. For we thinke not ceremonies indifferent to be of such moment, Marke this learned, wise, and goaty counsel that for them wee may make a Schisme in the Church. Let vs retaine the sinceritie of Doctrine, and hold fast the pure worship of GOD. Let other things serue partly peace and tranquillitie, partly the infirmitie of men; and let vs leaue these things to the prudent consideration of our superiours, and let them dispose thereof.
                  Out of these wordes of this great learned Writer, wee may gather all things necessarie, for the decision of all controuersies about rites and ceremonies of the Church. For first, hee telleth vs, that the varietie of ceremonies at Rome  
                       and Millan, did not offend Saint Austen and Saint Ambrose. Secondly, that priuate persons must bee obedient to    the lawes of their superiours, and not to take vpon them to alter those ceremonies, which higher powers haue appointed. Thirdly, that wee must not be curious, to    demaund reasons for euery ceremonie. Fourthly, that all    ceremonies are tollerable, which containe not in them manifest superstition and imp
                        •
                     etie. Fiftly, that Copes, Vestments,    Candels, Exorcismes, Crossings, and such like, are not things of suff
                        •
                     cient moment, to cause Schisme and dissention in the Church; but that all such things must be left, and wholy referred, to the consideration of higher powers. And both Bucer and Zuinglius teacheth the same doctrine, as is alreadie proued.
               
               
                  The third Obiection.
                  Now the Church is troubled with Chauncellours Commissaries, Officials, and such like; for defence whereof, no reason can be yeelded.
               
               
                  The Answere.
                  The antiquitie of Chauncellours and Officials, or of the



Substitutes and Vicars of Bishops, (which is all one in the thing it self,) is such & of so great authority in Gods church, that both old and late writers of best iudgement, moderation, and learning, haue acknowledged and approued the same. The auncient Councell of Ancyran, (which was afore 
                        Conc. Ancyr. Can. 13. the Nicen councell, euen almost 13. hundred yeares agoe,) hath these expresse words: Vicarijs Episcoporum (quos graci corepiscopos vocāt,) non licere vel presbyteros vel diaconos ordinare; sed nec presbyteris civitatis sine episcopi praecepto ampliùs aliquid imperare, nec sine authoritate literarum eius in vnaquaque parochia aliquid agere.
                  
                  We decree (saith this councell,) that it is not lawfull for the Vicars or Substitutes of Bishops, (whom the Greekes call fellow-bishops or coadiutors,) to order either Priests or Deacons; neither yet to bee lawfull to the Priests of the Citie, to command any thing else without the Bishops authoritie, or without the authoritie of his letters, to doe any thing in any parish. The auncient councell of Neocaesarea, 
                     
                        Conc. Neocae. can. 13. Con. Antioch. can. 8. and the Councell of Antioch, being likewise of great antiquitie, doe acknowledge and approue the saide Vicars or Substitutes of Bishops.
                  
                     Hemingius agreeth with the Canons of the afore-named councels, deliuering his opinion in these wordes: Hac potestate 
                     Hemingius in syntagm. de gubernat. eccles. 
                     ecclesia ordinat ministros pro commodo suo, vt omnia ordinatè fiant ad instaurationem corporis Christi. Hinc ecclesia purior sequuta tempora Apostolorum, alios patriarchas, alios episcopos, alios corepiscopos, alios pastores & catechistas instituit. Sequitur decori partes sunt duae. Prior, vt excitemur ad pietatem illis adminiculis. Posterior, vt modestia & gravitas in pietatis tractatione eluceat.
                  
                  By this power the Church ordereth Ministers for her owne good, that all things may bee done in order, for the instauration of the body of Christ. Hence the pure church, which followed after the dayes of the Apostles, appointed some to be Patriarches, some to be Bishops, some Coadiutors, Vicars, or fellow-bishops, othersome Pastors & Catechists.



Comelinesse, hath two parts; the first, that we may be drawen to pietie by these helpes; the other, that modestie and gravitie may shine, in the ordinance of pietie.
                  Out of these words, I note first, that the Church may    make and constitute diuerse degrees of Ministers, for her owne peace and for the building vp of Christes mysticall body. Secondly, that Patriarches, Arch-bishops, and    Substitutes or Suffragans of Bishops, and such like, were ordained euen then, when the Church was in her puritie. A most worthy observation, remember it well gentle Reader. Thirdly, that Ceremonies are some helpes, to bring men vnto pietie.   
                  
                  M. Bucer, M. Zanchius, and M. Calvin, the greatest Patrons of Presbiterie, doe all agree vnto this my doctrine, acknowledging it for the doctrine of the best and purest Churches, next after the Apostles-dayes. In regard of brevitie, I surcease from recital of their words.
                  
                     The Reply.
                     The Church of Geneva, where M. Calvin was the chief in his time, hath neither Patriarches, nor Arch-bishops, nor Suffragans, or substitute vicars.
                  
                  
                     The Answere.
                     I answere with M. Calvin himselfe, whose wordes are these; Talis morositas deterrima est pestis, quum morem ecclesiae 
                        Calvin in in arg in ep. ad gal. 
                        vnius volumus pro vniversali lege valere. Such morositie is a pestilent mischiefe, when we will haue the manner of one Church, to be in place of an vniversall law. Yea, if M. Calvin, were this day liuing, he would not affirme the vsage of Geneva, to be a fit paterne for the gouernment of our English Church. Many Ceremonies and constitutions agree well to our Church, which were nothing convenient to some other. Hence commeth it, that the Church hath authoritie,



as I haue alreadie prooued,) to constitute, make, and publish, such Canons, Rules, and Ordinances, as tend to the common good and peaceable government thereof.
                  
               
               
                  
                     The 4. Obiection.
                  
                  The Bishops take vpon them to giue the holy Ghost, when they ridiculously make Ministers. For they say, Receiue ye the holy Ghost.
               
               
                  The Answere.
                  I answere, that the manner of ordering Ministers vsed in our English Church, descended by tradition from the best, most auncient, and purest Churches. Which thing Saint Ambrose, Saint Augustin, Saint Hierome, and all the holy Fathers doe constantly affirme with vniforme assent. Neither doth the Bishop take vppon him to give the holy Ghost, but humbly and reuerently pronounceth Christes wordes, according to the vsuall practise of all Churches in best approoued times; thereby signifying vnto the newly ordered Ministers, their principall charge and dutie, and assuring them of the assistance of Gods holy Spirit, if they labour in their calling as they ought to doe. Which vsage of our English Church, is consonant aswell to the practise of auncient Churches, as to the doctrine of Saint Paul himselfe to Timothie, when 2. Tim 1. Uer. 6. Vide Calv. libr. 4 instit. cap. 3. in fine & notato.
                      hee saith; Wherefore I put thee in remembraunce, thou stirre vp the gift of GOD which is in thee, by the putting on of mine hands. For albeit all things necessarie for our salvation, bee contained in the Scriptures, either expresly, or by neceslarie consequence, yet are many other things very profitable for the externall gouernment of the Church, which are partly receiued by tradition from the Apostles, and partly



added by the authoritie of the Church, as circumstances of times, places, and persons did require. Of this point of doctrine M. Zuinglius disputeth very learnedly, in a large 
                        Zuinglius part. 2. De baptismo, pag. 87. discourse against the Anabaptists. His wordes are these; Apostolos baptizatos fuisse nusquālegimus, nisi quod de duobus tantùm mentio fiat, Iohan. 1. Vbi tamen idem hoc non disertè expressum est, sed obscuriùs innuitur. Quod si ergo vestro more nihil eorum factum esse dicemus, quae scripturis sacris non continentur; iam & D. virginem Mariam, & ipsos quoque Apostolos, baptismi signo nunquam inauguratos fuisse fateri cogemur; quoa ab omni pietate & religione est quàm alienissimum. Sequitur: caeterùm quòd ad dogmata fides spectat, & eas res quae fidem nostram & internum hominem informant perpetuò hoc ce

                         presenti antidoto vtendum est, quod Deus non praecepit credere, vt credamus adsalutem necessarium non est. Cultum hunc non descripsit, nec iniunxit Dominus, ergo illi placere & acceptus

                     esse non potest. Ceremoniarum autem ratio longè alia est. Nec enim dicere licebit, de ceremonijs istis in Scriptura nihil proditum est, ergo ceremonijs istis vsi non sunt; quod ipsum in exemplo divae virginis & Apostolorum abundè satis demonstratum est.
                  
                  We reade in no place of the holy Scripture, that the Apostles weare baptized; saue onely, that mention is made of two in S. Iohn. Where for all that, the same is not plainely expressed, but obscurely infinuated. If therefore wee shall follow your manner, and denie all things, which are not conteyned in the holy scriptures; then certes, we shall bee compelled to graunt, that neither the blessed Virgin Marie, nor the Apostles them selues were euer baptized; which doubtlesse is a strange assertion, and farre from all pietie and religion. But touching doctrines of Faith, and those things which informe our faith & the inward mā, we must ever vse this as a present preseruatiue; what God hath not cōmanded vs to beleeue, to beleeue that is not necessarie to our saluation. Our Lord neither appointed, nor inioyned this kinde of worship; therfore it can neither please, nor bee acceptable to him. But touching ceremonies, the



case is farre different. For wee may not say; there is no mention made of these Ceremonies in the Scripture, therefore the Apostles vsed them not; which thing is prooued abundantly, by the example of the blessed Virgin, and of the Apostles. Out of this must excellent discourse, I obserue these worthy documents. First, that all things necessarie    for our saluation, are comprised in the holy Scriptures. Secondly, that many other things necessarie for    Church-gouernment, are receiued by tradition. Thirdly,    that it is not a good Argument, to reason after this manner; there is no mētion of these things in the Scriptures, therfore the Apostles vsed them not, or therefore they are not lawfull. This doctrine is agreeable to Saint Austins rule, who 
                        August. in Epist. ad Ianuar. 1. Cor. 11. 16. calleth it insolent madnes, to withstand and contradict that, which is receiued by the custome of the whole Church. Yea, it is consonant to S. Pauls practise, against the malapert saucinesse of contentious persons.

                   with a Presbyterie; that is, with Pastors, Teachers, Laicall vnpriested Elders, and Deacons, These 4. (as they contend) are the lawfull Gouernors of euery particular congregation. Pastors and teachers, for procuring the aduancement of the faith of the Church; Elders, for the censure of their conuersation and life; and Deacons, for the comfort of the poore. That that the truth of this controuersie, (of which many talke, but very few vnderstand it aright,) may be laide open to the indifferent Reader, I haue thought it good to proceed therein, by way of Propositions.
               
                  
                  
                     The 1. Proposition.
                  
                  THat kinde of gouernment, which may bee altered for the circumstances of times, places, and persons, is neither necessarie nor perpetuall. But the gouernment by Pastors, Doctors, Elders, and Deacons, (if euer there were any such kind of gouernment in the Christian world,) may be altered and chaunged; Ergo, it is neither necessarie, nor perpetuall. the Argument is in forme, and the Proposition most cleare & euident to euery childe. The difficultie or

                      doubt (if there be any,) resteth in the assumption. But I haue prooued it at large, where I disputed of the Churches authoritie, in things indifferent. Yea, there was a time, euen in the dayes of the Apostles, when the Church had no 
                        Act. 6. Acts 14. Vide infrà, cap. 12 sect. 4. Deacons. There was also a time, euen in the dayes of the same Apostles, when the Church had no vnpriested or vnpreaching Elders. Who so readeth seriously, the Acts of the Apostles and S. Pauls Epistles, can not bee ignorant in this behalfe.
               
               
                  
                     The 2. Proposition.
                  
                  CHrist did not translate the Sanhedrim, Synedrion, or Consistorie of the Iewes, vnto his Church in the newe Testament. I proue it first, because both their    lesse kinde of Sanhedrim, and their great (as they did afterward diuide it,) was onely in one place for all the Realme; viz. First at Sylo, then at Hierusalem their chiefe citie, vntill the worst and last alterations therein; but the seekers of the newe English Presbyterie, would haue the like, (if not the very same,) to bee erected in euery congregation.   
                  
                  Againe in both Consistories of the Iewish Sanhedrim, 
                        Vide infrà. ca. 12. sect. 4. aswell in the greater of the 70: as in the lesser of the 23. they were all either Priests, or Doctors of the Lawe, the    King and the Peeres of the Realme only excepted. Thirdly,

iurisdiction both together; but our Presbyters haue onely ecclesiasticall, seeing (as they graunt,) to be Iudges in ciuill places, is onely the Office of the ciuill Magistrate.
               
               
                  
                     The 3. Proposition.
                  
                  THe English supposed Presbyterie, is not compatible with a Christian Monarchie; but must perforce despoyle

                      her, and bereaue her of her royall soueraignitie. I proue it, because the sayd Presbyterie challengeth vnto her selfe, all authoritie in causes ecclesiasticall; the supreme ouer-sight of which causes, pertaineth to the ciuill Magistrate, as is already proued.
               
               
                  
                     The 4. Proposition.
                  
                  THE English desired Presbyterie, is not grounded vpon the word of GOD. I proue it, because the Scriptures alledged by the Patrons thereof, doe conclude no such matter. The Textes are fiue in number, being all that any way seeme to make for their purpose. The first is out of the Gospell, (tell the Church). To this Text I 
                        Matt 18. ver. 17. 1 answere in this manner; First, that wee for the true meaning of this portion of Scripture, will giue credite to Saint Chrysostome, and the rest of the auncient Fathers; The Church to which this complaint must bee made, doth signifie the Bishops and gouernours of the Church; who, according to all generall Councels, auncient Canons, and the continuall practise of the Church; were euer to this day reputed, acknowledged, and taken for the Church representiue. Secondly, that if we will be ruled by M. Calvins  
                       censure; Christ doth not here say any thing of the church, 
                        Calvin in harmonia evang. 3. of the New Testament, but alludeth to the order of the Church of the Iewes. Thirdly, that by the iudgement of the graue and learned writer M. Bullinger, a great Patron of the Presbyterie, Christ speaketh here of the whole congregation;



and not to a fewe persons, of whom consisteth Calvin in harmonia Evang. the supposed Presbyterie. And this exposition is so agreeable to the Text, as none with right reason can denie the same. Yea this sense is indeed agreeable to the verdict of S. Chrysostome and of all the auncient Fathers, and to the continuall practise of the Church in all ages. These are 
                        Bullingerus advers. Anabapt. lib. 3. cap. 4 Vide infrà, cap. 12. sect. 4. & no. ta valdè.
                      M. Bullingers wordes; Quamobrem, hinc efficitur, ecclesiam habere potestatem & mandatum eligendiministros. Hoc autem facere potest, veltota ecclesia, vel fidi homines ab ecclesia, ad hoc electi, prout commodius, vtilius, & ad pacem conservandam aptius videtur; prolocorum, personarum, & temporumratione. Nam cuncta haec ad Pauli regulam dirigenda sunt, vt omnia decentèr & ordine fiant. Wherefore, hence it commeth, that the Church hath power and commaundement to choose her Ministers. And this may bee performed, either by the whole Church, or by faithfull men chosen of the Church for this ende and purpose; as shall bee thought more commodious, profitable, and fit for the conseruation of peace; respect being had to places, persons, and times. For all these things must bee reterred to Pauls rule, that all things be done decently and in order. And a little after, the same Writer hath these wordes: Habent autem istisuam potestatem exeo quod a tota ecclesia detecti sunt, quaeex verbo Deipotestatem & manda
                           •
                        n̄ habet eligendi ecclesiae ministros. But these men haue their authoritie, for that the whole Church hath chosen them, which by Gods word hath power and commandement, to choose the Ministers of the Church. Thus writeth this learned man.
                  Out of whose words it is most apparent & cleare, that all power is graunted vnto the whole Church, who to auoyde confusion and for order sake, committeth her authoritie to certaine chosen persons. Which persons are the Bishops and Prelates of the Church, say I, and all antiquitie will confesse the same with me. For neither Councels, Fathers, nor auncient Canons, doe make any mention of the late vpstart presbyterie.
                  
                     
The Second text is fathered vpon Saint Paul, where he saith; let him that ruleth, doe it with diligence. The third 
                        Rom. 12. Vers. 8. text is drawne from the same Apostle, where he telleth vs, that God hath ordained in the Church, some Apostles, some Prophets, some teachers, some workers of miracles; 1. cor. 12. Vers. 28. after that, the gifts of healing, helpers, gouernours. To these two texts, which are of one and the same effect, for the establishing of the presbyterie, I answere in this māner; First, that the Apostle in both places may be vnderstood    indifferently, either of ciuill gouernours and gouernment onely, or of ecclesiasticall onely, or of both ioyntly, & consequently, that the text cannot be racked so, that it must perforce be vnderstood, of the vnpriested Seniors of the Presbyterie, especially, seeing it may as fitly, if not more truly, be vnderstood of Kings. Monarches, and other ciuill christian Magistrates; to whom the chiefe care and ouersight appertaineth, of all persons and causes within their kingdomes, territories, and dominions. Secondly, that the    original Greek word (Cubernesejs) signifieth gouernments, not gouernours. So that thereupon cannot be inferred necessarily, any distinct gouernor from the afore-named Apostles, prophets, and Doctors. For diuers offices may bee and often are, coincident in one and the same officer. And for this respect, when the Apostle commeth to the repetition Marke this point well. of his former assertions, and should by order haue mentioned the gift of gouernance; he passeth it ouer in silence, albeit he reckoneth vp the other seuerally. Wherby hee giueth vs to vnderstand, that hee containeth the same, either in all, or in some one of the former offices or gifts. Thirdly,    that none of the holy Fathers in their Commentaries, did euer gather out of these texts or the like, any vnpreaching Seniors. Fourthly, that both maister Caluin, maister    
                     Bucer, and maister Martyr, doe extend these places to all kinde of gouernment. The fourth text is taken from the 
                        Ephes. 4. Epistle to the Ephesians, which proueth nothing at all, because there is no mention made in that place of any gouernours,



saue onely of Apostles, Euangelists, Prophets, Pastors, and Doctors. None of which doubtlesse, can be their vnpriested Elders.
                  The Fift text is borrowed from Saint Paul to Timothie, 
                     
                        
                           •
                        . Tim. 5. where he saith, the Elders that rule well, are worthy of double honour: specially, they which labour in the word and Doctrine. This text I graunt, hath some colour (though no truth) of that, which is in question. But I answere, that the Apostle vnderstandeth by Elders, such as are ministers of the word, or else of the Sacraments. I proue it first, because    Saint Hierome, Saint Chrysostome, and Saint Ambrose, yea and maister Caluin himselfe, (where hee speaketh purposely of Seniors,) doe so vnderstand the word (Elders.) Secondly,    because the originall Greeke worde (Coptôntes) 
                     
                        Caluin. libr. 4 institut. cap 4. § 2. which signifieth to labour painfully, doth argue a differēce betweene Elders of the same calling, whereof some laboured more painfully then others did, the meaning of the Apostle is this, and no other: that laborious and painfull Elders, are so much the more worthy to be graced with greater honours: by howe much greater paines and troublesome turmoyles, they vndertake in their ministerie. For by the word (labour,) Saint Paul vnderstandeth no ordinarie, vulgar, and meane exercise; but an extraordinarie, vehement, and most painfull labour; such as Timothie, Titus, Luke, Marke, and others, were well acquainted withall. Thirdly, because the Apostle, if hee had meant that some    Elders did neither preach, nor administer the Sacraments, would haue added, which labour in the word and administration of the Sacraments, for it had been as easily said, as, which labour in the word and doctrine; but, because there were some, that laboured onely in the word and doctrine, and other some likewise, who laboured in administring the Sacraments; hee saide (Coptôntes) which labour painfully, to distinguish them from such as laboured in the same kind and office, though not in so laborious and painefull maner.
               
               
                  
                  The fift proposition.
                  THe constitution of the earnestly wished, and long expected English presbyterie, doth ouerthrowe it selfe, and can no way be defēded. I proue it first, because    diaconesses or widowes are no lesse required in the holy scripture, then are Deacons; neither are the one 1. Tim. 5. more extraordinarie or temporarie, then are the other. And consequently, the frame or building of the presbyterie is not perfect, seeing it consisteth onely of these foure; Pastors, Teachers, Elders, Deacons. And to answere as some doe, that there must bee godly poore widowes when they can bee gotten, is not to the purpose. For if Gods appointment and order may bee altered in widowes, because sit women cannot bee gotten; euen so may wee excuse, the want of their ruling vpriested Seniors, as also the want of their Preaching Ministers. For the necessitie and want of sit persons,    is equall in them all. I proue it. Secondly, because Pastors and Doctors or Teachers are not distinct officers, but are taken in holy Writ for one and the same. For Saint Paul hauing seuered Apostles, Prophets, and Euangelists, 
                        Ephes. 4. Vers. 11. addeth to them Pastors and Teachers by a coniunction copulatiue; which hoe would not haue done doubtlesse, if hee had deemed them to bee different orders. Saint Hierome is iumpe of mine opinion, and reasoneth Hier. in hunc locum. after the selfe same manner. And Saint Austen beeing demaunded of Peulimis, what difference was betwixt Pastor and Doctor, a pastor and a Teacher, answered 
                        Aug. apud Haymonem, in 4. cap. ad ephes.
                      in this sort; viz. That they were all one, because hee cannot bee a pastor, who hath not Doctrine, wherewith hee may feede the flocke committed to his charge.
                  
                     
Maister Bullinger decideth the controuersie in plaine tearmes, writing in this manner; Nemo autem est, qui non vi
                           •
                         deat hac vocabula invicem confundi & alterum accipi pro altero. Nam apostolus etiam propheta, doctor, evangelista, presbyter, atque episcopus est. Et episcopus evangelista & propheta est. Propheta doctor, presbyter, & evangelista. Proinde apostolus paulus, varijs hisce vocabulis varia illa dona significavit, qua dominus ecclesiae suae importijt ad salutem.
                  
                  Euery man seeth, that these wordes are confounded, and that one of them is taken for an other. For an Apostle is also a Prophet, a Doctor, an Euangelist, a Priest, and a Bishop. And a Bishop is an Euangelist and a Prophet. A Prophet is a Doctor, an Elder, and an Euangelist. Therefore the Apostle Paul, by these diuers names signifieth those diuers gifts, which our Lord bestowed on his Church vnto saluation. I therefore conclude, that the pillers whereupon the presbyterie is builded, are sandie, rotten, and vnsound; and consequently, that that building which is reared vpon them, cannot but be vnstable and ruinous.
               
               
                  The sixt Proposition.
                  THe newe English presbyterie, was not knowne or heard of in the Christian world, for the space of fifteene hundred yeares together at the least. This proposition is sufficiently proued, by this precedent discourse; if it be well marked from the beginning. Yea, my bare assertion is a good proofe thereof; vntill the patrons of the contrarie opinion, can and shall name the time and place, when and where such a presbyterie was to be found.
               
               
                  The seuenth Proposition
                  ALL Ministers created and made by the newe presbyterie, are meere lay-persons, and cannot lawfully, either Preach Gods word, or administer the sacraments.



This is alreadie proued. I will therefore salute our Brownists, Barrowists, and such like, as the learned and famous Writer Maister Bullinger did the Anabaptists. His 
                        Bullinger. aduers. Anabapt. libr. 3. cap. 7. wordes are these; Quod si dicitis, vos instar apostolorum peculiarem vocationem habere, probate eam signis & miraculis, dono linguarum, doctrina apostolica, quemadmodum apostoli fecerunt. Hoc autem nunquam facietis, ideoque vocatio vestra nihili, imò pernitiosa est ecclesiae Christi.
                  
                  Now, if you say, you haue a speciall and peculiar calling, as the Apostles had: then must you prooue the same, by signes and miracles, by speaking diuers languages, and by doctrine apostolicall, as the Apostles did. 
                        Hier. adver. Lucifer. tom. 3. ferè in fine.
                     
                  
                  Saint Hierome saith; Ecclesia non est, quae non babet sacerdotem. Where there is no priest or minister, there can bee no Church.
                  
                     The first Obiection
                     That not Kings, Monarches, and other independant ciuil magistrates, haue the supreame and highest authoritie in causes ecclesiasticall, but that Bishops and Priests haue that charge committed to them, as their proper and peculiar function, it may appeare euidently to all indifferent readers, by the facts and proceedings of Bishops in the old testament. Ieroboams hand dried vp; Ozias was smitten with the leprosie, and thrust out of the Temple, king Saul deposed 1. Reg. 13. 2. par. 26. 1. sam 13. 2. reg. 11. 2. par. 19. from his kingdome, and all this befel vpon these kings, because they tooke vpon them, the supreame authoritie in causes ecclesiasticall. Yea, Iehoiada the Priest commaunded to put Queene Athalia out of the ranges, and to execute the iudgement of death vpon her. And king Iehosaphat affirmeth plainly, that Amariah was chiefe ruler in all matters of the Lord, as Zebadiah was the ciuill gouernour of all the kings affaires.
                  
                  
                     The Answere.
                     This obiection containeth a question of great moment, and is very obscure, intricate, and difficult. Wherefore I admonish



and aduise the gentle Reader, to reade my answere againe, and againe, and to ponder it seriously, before hee giue his iudgement therein. My answere standeth thus, First, that Ieroboams hand was dried vp, and Saul deposed    from his royall throne; not, for that they challenged a soueraigntie aboue the Priests, and supreame authoritie in causes ecclesiastical; but, because they attempted arrogantly and presumptiously, to execute priestly functiō, in offering incense vpon the Altar, burnt offerings, & peace offerings. Secondly, that Vzziah or Ozias was smitten with the leprosie,    because hee would needes burne incense to the Lord, which was the Priests proper function. Neither did the Priests for all that thrust him out of the Temple, but dutifully, (as it become them,) told him what was his dutie, and that he had offended God; and therefore they willed him to surcease from his wicked enterprise, and to goe foorth of the sanctuarie. Which was no other vsage, then S. Iohn the Baptist afforded Herode the Tetrach; when he told him, it was not lawfull for him, to haue his brothers wife. Thirdly, 
                           Mat. 14. Vers. 4. 3 that the fact of Iehosaphat, proueth euidently the Kings supreame power ouer all his subiects, as well in causes ecclesiasticall, as ciuill. The reason hereof is euident, because King Iehosophat by vertue of his prerogatiue royall, placed both Amariah and Zebadiah in their seuerall functions, and prescribed the limits of their iurisdictions. Neither will it helpe to say, that Amariah was ruler in the matters of the Lord, and Zebadiah in the Kings affaires. For 
                           Suprá. cap. 4. note the whole chapter.
                         the meaning is not, that the Kings affaires are not the matters of the Lord; seeing (as is alreadie proued,) that the King at his inauguration, receiueth the whole booke of the law, and charge to see Gods true worship and seruice euery where maintained. But the true sense of the text is this, and no other, viz. that those things, which the King in his owne person may execute, are precisely called the Kings affaires; to distinguish them from his other affaires, which himselfe cannot put in execution.



For, albeit in the preaching of the word & administratiō of the Sacraments, the chosen minister hath onely the charge and authoritie to execute them; neuerthelesse, Gods annointed Prince hath the supreame charge & souereigne authoritie, to command the execution thereof; as also to correct and to punish the Minister, for the neglect of his dutie in that behalfe. Of which point I haue spoken sufficiently in my other bookes, and therefore deeme it a thing needlesse now to stand long vpon the same. Fourthly, touching the fact of Iehoiada the Priest, I answere, that it can no way, proue the superioritie of Priests ouer kings. For first, Iehoiada  
                          was not a priuate man, but the high Priest in the cō
                        mon weale of the Iewes; whose office it was, to iudge not ecclesiasticall matters onely, but also ciuill. For the Iewes had no other lawes, but the holy scriptures. Secondly, Iehoiada  
                          did nothing against Athalia of himselfe, but with the aduise, assent, and helpe, of the Centurions and Peeres of the Realme; all which were bound by the lawe of Deuteronomie, to defend the kingdome from strangers. Thirdly, 
                           Dent. 17. v. 15. 
                        Iehoiada was bound by the right of affinitie; to defend king Ioas, and to establish him in his Kingdome. For his wife    was the kings Aunt. Fourthly, God had assured by his    infallible promise, the Kingdome to the familie of Dauid. Now Athalia was not of the stocke and Progenie of David, but a stranger to the Kingdome. For her mother was a Sydonian, and her father an Israelite, more addicted to idolatrie, then were the Gentiles. Besides this, the wicked pretensed Queene Athalia, had traiterously murdered and wholy extinguished, all the lawfull royall blood, (the yong childe king Ioas onely excepted, whom God contrarie to her knowledge, had miraculously preserued,) and withall shee had set vp the worship of Baal. Wherefore, it was the parts of the Priests and Peeres of the Kingdome, to protect the King, to defend his royall right, to suppresse the vsurped power of Athalia, and to deliuer the King,



his kingdome, and themselues, from the confused Ataxia Idolatrie, & bloodie tyrannie, which she had brought vpon them by her violent intr
                           •
                        sion, and vniust vsurpation of the royall right of Ioas, their Lawfull King and vndoubted soueraigne. So then, albeit the Ministerie of feeding, of Preaching Gods word, and of the administration of his Sacraments, pertaine onely to his ministers, neither may the meere ciuill magistrate in any wise intermedle therewith; yet for al that, most true it is, that the prouision for the food, the ouer sight that the children of God be duly fed, and that the ministers doe exercise their functiōs in vigilant & dutifull manner, belongeth to the ciuil independant, and absolute princes. For this respect is it, that Kings and Queenes 
                           Esa 49. Vers. 23. haue the names of nurses, not for that they nourish their children in ciuil matters onely, but as in ciuil, so also in spirituall, that is to say, in lacte verbi dei, in the milke of the word of God. For though the execution pertaine to the ministers yet the prouision, direction, appointment, care, and ouer-sight, (which is the supreame gouernmēt indeed,) belongeth onely, soly, and wholy to the prince. For this cause is it, that King Ezechias highly renowned in holy Writ, 
                        2. par. 29. Vers. 5. 11. 15 though he were but yong in yeares, did for all that in regard of his prerogatiue royall, and supreame authoritie in causes ecclesiasticall, call the Priests and Leuits his sonnes, charging them to heare him, and to followe his direction, and commandement, for so are the words of the text. This notwithstanding, I graunt freely and willingly, that ministers in the action of their ecclesiastical function & church-ministerie, are aboue all christians, aboue Queenes, Kings, and Monarches, representing God vnto them, teaching, admonishing, & rebuking them, euen as all others: following the godly example therein, of S. Iohn yt
                         Baptist. Yea if need so require and that the vices of the princes, kings, and monarches, be notorious, & scandalous to the whole church, 
                           Mat. 14. Vers. 4. the Bishops may denounce such potentates, to be enemies to the truth, aduersaries to GOD, and no true members



of the Church; but forlorne people, to be reputed as Ethnicks & publicans, vntill they giue true signes of vnfeyned repentance. But withall, this must euer be remembred and most loyally obserued, of all Bishops in Christs Church; 
                           Mat. 18. 
                        viz. that the prince, (though full of manifest vices, & most notorious crimes in the world,) may neuer be shunned, neither of the people, nor of the Bishops; seeing God hath appointed him to bee their gouernour. Much lesse may the people forsake their obedience, to his sacred prerogatiue royall and supereminent authoritie. And least of all, (for it is most execrable, damnable, and plaine diabolicall,) may either the people alone, or the Bishops alone, or both ioyntly together, depose their vndoubted soveraigne, though a Tyrant, Heretique, or Apostata. For all loyall obedience

                         and faithfull seruice in all civil affaires, and whatsoever els is lawfull, they must euer yeeld vnto him. He may bee admonished by the Ministers in the Court of conscience, concerning his publique offences: but he may neuer bee iudged in the court of their Consistorie, touching his power royall and princely prerogatiue, their power is only to admonish and rebuke him, and to pray to God to amend that is amisse. Hee hath no iudge that can punish him, but the great iudge of all, euen the GOD of heauen. Note the answeres to all the obiections following, & marke them seriously.
                  
                  
                     
                        The 2. Obiection.
                     
                     Great learned men doe hold, that there were vnpriested Seniors in the Primitiue Church, who together with the Pastors did gouerne the Church. And the same is this day practised, in many reformed Churches.
                  
                  
                     The Answere.
                     I answere: First, that I doe not condemne the practise of



other reformed Churches, but teach plainly and Christianly, that euery Church hath freedome, libertie, and authoritie, to make such canons, orders, ordinances, and constitutions, as shall bee thought most meete, fit, and conuenient, for the external gouernment thereof. Which thing I haue already proued; not onely by the practise of the Church in all ages, but also by the vniforme assent and constant verdict, of best approoued Patrons of the reformed Churches in this age. Secondly, that those great Patrons of the reformed    Churches, who deeme vnpriested Elders to be convenient for their particular precincts, free cities, and common weales, doe for all that thinke an other gouernment more fit for Christian Monarchies, and doe highly commend the same. I might alledge the ioynt testimonies, of M. Gualter, M. Hemingius, M. Bucer, and of many other famous late Writers; But in regard of breuitie, onely M. Musculus shall content me for the present. These are his expresse words; Principio, vt constituat ecclesiarum ministres, 
                        
                           Musculus in locis, titul de magistr. Pag. 632. 
                        vbi illi desiderantur, sive eligat eos ipse, five ab alijs iussu ipsim electos confirmet. Ne
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                           . n. convenit, vt praeter authoritatem potestatis publicae public a quisquā numer a in ecclesia obeat. Dices; at secùs factūest in primis ecclesiis, in quibus a ministris ac plebe eligebantur ecclesiarum antistites. Respondeo; talis tum ecclesiarum erat status vt aliter non essent eligendi ministri, propterea quod Christiano magistratu destituebantur. Sirevocas temporum illorum mores, primùm conditiones ac statum quo
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                            illorum revoca.
                     
                     First, it is the dutie of the ciuil magistrate, to constitute the ministers of the church, where they be wanting; whether he choose thē himselfe, or confirme those which others by appointment haue chosen. For it is not meete, that any minister execute any function in the Church, without the authoritie of the publique Magistrate. You will say; But it was otherwise in the Primitiue Church, where the Ministers and the people did choose their Gouernours. I answere; the state of the Church was then such, that the Ministers



of the Church could not be chosen otherwise, because then they were destitute of a Christian Magistrate. If thou wilt vse the manners of that time, thou must first call againe the condition and state of that time.
                     Out of these words, I note many golden obseruations. First, that the ciuill Magistrate may appoint and elect the    ministers of the Church. Secondly, that none can lawfully    execute any Church-foundation, or bee a Minister of the Church, without election, assent, authoritie, or confirmation of the ciuil magistrate. Thirdly, that the ciuil magistrate    may either choose the ministers himselfe, or appoint others to doe it. Fourthly, that the gouernment of the church    may be altered, according to the circūstances of times, places & persons. Fiftly, that the English long expected presbyterie,    can not stand with our English Christian Monarchie. For, she challengeth that as her proper office, which as Musculus truly saith,) doth properly pertaine to the ciuill Christian Magistrate.
                     I say thirdly, that it cannot be concluded out of the holy Tertiò principaliter. Scriptures, that any annuall vnpriested Elders, had the rule of the Church with the Pastors and Bishops.   
                     
                     
                        I say fourthly, that for want of Christian Princes, laicall    Elders may be assumed to the Church-gouernment, to help and assist the pastors. Yea, I further graunt, that the said Elders may remaine vnder a christian prince so it be with his assent, good pleasure, and moderation. But I constantly denie, that such kind of gouernment must of necessitie bee had, in and vnder a Christian Monarchie.
                     
                        The first Reply.
                        S. Ambrose writeth plainly, that the Synagogue, and after, 
                              Ambros. in prior. Epist. ad Timoth. cap. 5. the Church had Seniours, without whose counsell nothing was done in the Church. The which saith hee, by what negligence it was left of, I can not tell; except happily it were through the slouth, or rather the pride of some pastors, because they alone would seeme to bee somewhat.
                     
                     
                        
                        The Answere.
                        I answere; first, that S. Ambrose did not thinke those Elders, of whom hee speaketh, to be necessarie for the government of the Church. I prooue it, because hee being a most learned, zealous, and godly Arch-bishop, would for his zeale and pietie haue laboured to restore them: and could for his great authoritie, haue effected the same. Secondly,    that Saint Ambrose speaketh of Elders in yeares, not of Elders in Office: that is, of wise, graue, and olde men of great experience, whom the Bishops in former times tooke in counsell with them, as did also the auncient Synagogue. Our Church-wardens in this age, doe in some sort resemble them.
                        It something grieued holy Ambrose, that graue men, auncient in yeares, whom the Apostle would not haue reproued roughly, did not remaine in like esteeme with the pastors of the Church, as they were of old. This is the true meaning and sense of S. Ambrose, concerning those Elders he speaketh of. I prooue it out of S. Ambrose his owne wordes, which are these: Nam apud omnes vti
                                 
                                    
                                 
                                 que
                               gentes, honorabilis est senectus. For among all nations olde age is honoured. For which cause, both the Synagogue of old, and the Church afterward, had alwayes certaine old men, without whose aduise nothing was done in the Church. Loe, he speaketh of honouring Elders and auncient men, in regard of their yeares. But he neuer meant to equalize them with those, who were Elders in calling, and gouerned the Churches vnder him. No, no: the blessed man Ambrose, that graue and holy Bishop of Millan, neuer dreamed or once conceiued in minde, that any order of the Ministerie, set downe by Christes Apostles, was worne out of vse in his time.
                     
                     
                        
                           The 2. Reply.
                        
                        S. Hierome who followed S. Ambrose immediately telleth vs most plainly, that in his time the Presbyterie or Eldership was in the Church.
                     
                     
                        
                        The Answere.
                        I answere; first, that if wee suppose your Presbyterie    to haue beene in Saint Hieroms time, and not in the dayes of Saint Ambrose; it will fauour vs, and wholy make against your helpes. The reason is euident, because that which Note this well. may bee vsed at some time, and be wanting at other times, is not of necessitie to be vrged at all times; and this is all that wee desire. Secondly, Saint Hierome speaketh of Priested    Elders, and not of men in no degree of the Ministerie. 
                              Hier. in Esa. to. 5. lib. 2. cap. 3. His wordes are these; Et nos habemus in ecclesia senatum nostrum, caetum Presbyterorum. And we haue in the Church our Senate, a companie of Elders or Priestes. Loe, hee speaketh of Priestes, and of Colledges of Cathedrall Churches. I proue it by two reasons; First, for that himselfe telleth vs, in his words afore-going; that he speaketh of those Elders, whose election Saint Paul describeth vnto Timothie. Againe, because it is vnpossible, that those vnpriested Elders should bee in Saint Hieromes time, who were worne out in Saint Ambrose his time; because Saint Austin, S. Ambrose, and S. Hierome, were all at one and the same time.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                        The 3. Obiection.
                     
                     The long expected Presbyterie, is no way preiudiciall to the Christian Monarchie, but giueth to him so much as the Scripture alloweth.
                  
                  
                     The Answere.
                     M. Gualter, a zealous, vertuous, and learned Writer, of high esteeme in the reformed Churches, sheweth plainly vnto the world, what right and authoritie the new presbyterie 
                           Gualter. in I. cor. II. ascribeth vnto Princes. These are his wordes; The Donatists of our time ought to consider these things more diligently, which doe ouer rashly condemne whole Cities,



and Countries, where the word of God is preached, the sacraments rightly administred publique praier celebrated, the poore sufficiently prouided for, and vices, by good and godly lawes for bidden and punished. All these things they esteem as nothing, except there be a certaine new magistracie appointed, which should haue authoritie ouer Princes also. The same learned writer in another place, discourseth in this manner: There be sundry that will needes institute 
                           Gualter. in 1. Cor. ca. 12. Elders, or an ecclesiasticall Senate, according to the example of the Primitiue Church, which also should haue authoritie ouer the Magistrates themselues, if at any time they did not their dutie. But it behooueth them first, to shew, that those their Seniours haue this power, whereof Paul doth presently speake: which thing seeing it doth by no meanes appeare, and yet they deliuer vnto Satan whome they will; they doe like, as if some would goe about to cleanse the leaprous, raise the dead, and worke other miracles, because these things were vsually done in the primitiue Church. The same learned Doctor in another place writeth thus: Their ambition is reproued, which goe about to 
                           Gualter. in 1. Cor 14. bring all Churches to the forme of their discipline and government, & cry out that there is no discipline there, where all things are not agreeable to their traditions and orders. But these mē receiue a iust reward of their arrogancy, when they that come frō them to other countries, goe beyond all men in fancinesse, & bring nothing from home, but a vaine and intollerable contempt of all good men, neither can they abide to be corrected by any admonition of others.
                     The zealous, godly, and learned Doctor Musculus, hath these expresse words. We thinke otherwise then they, 
                           Musculus in locis, de magistr. Pag. 631. who denie to Christian Magistrates, authoritie to make ecclesiasticall Lawes. We boldly affirme, that all power of making authenticall Lawes, which binde the consciences of the subiects, whether they be ciuill or ecclesiasticall: doe neither pertaine to the multitude of the faithfull, nor to the Ministers of Gods word, but properly to the Magistrate



onely, to whom more power is giuen ouer his subbiects. Wherevpon they are called in the Scripture, Gods, who doe execute the Magistracie: which name of honour, we doe not reade that it was giuen vnto the Priestes. The very reason and nature of gouerning can not suffer, that there be 2. authentique powers in one people, two diuers law-makings and dominions, vnlesse it be by subordination; euen as there is no place, for two heads in one body.
                     The same Musculus in another place, hath these golden 
                           Vbi suprà, Pag. 630. wordes: but we without dissimulation thinke thus. Like as the Christian Prince hath chiefe power & care in religion, so hath he also power to constitute and make ecclesiasticall lawes, & to reforme abuses in religion. The very nature of making lawes doth not suffer, that they command & make Lawes, who haue not power to defend the Lawes, and to take punishment of the transgressors: and that the Magistrate should protect the lawes, and punish the offendors, who shal not haue power to make the lawes, which he doth defend. But Certes, among men he that hath power to command, hath also power to take reuenge. I know it appertaineth to the magistrate, to punish not onely the transgressors of his owne commandements, but also of Gods. But the case is altered, if the question be made of lawes ecclesiasticall, neither divulged by God immediately, neither yet by his Apostles, but by men within the ministerie of the Church. Here doubtlesse it is not sit, that they which are of meaner authoritie, shall make Lawes: and they who are of higher power, must see them kept. Men of meaner degree, may cause lawes to be obserued: but superiours onely can make lawes, whose authoritie cōpelleth to obey them, and who haue power giuen thē of God, to punish the disobedient. While therefore they ascribe the constitution and promulgation of ecclesiasticall lawes to those, whom they call gouernours of the church, (to wit, the presbyterie,) and leaue only to the magistrate, power to see them kept, and to punish the offenders: what other thing do they, but giues



that to inferiours being subiects, which of right belongeth to higher powers; and taketh it away from superiours, to whom euery soule must be subiect. And so they peruerting the ordinance of God make of subiects Lawe-makers, and of Law-makers subiects. Thus writeth this learned man.
                     Out of these learned discourses of these two most learned and famous Writers, I note these worthy documents. First, that vnder most Christian Princes, where the Presbyterie    beareth no sway; the word of God is soundly preached, the Sacraments rightly administred, publique prayer duly celebrated, the poore sufficiently relieued, and vices sharply punished. Secondly, that all these things will not content the maisters of the Presbyterie, vnlesse they    may haue Princes at their commaund. Thirdly, that if the Patrons of the Presbyterie, will needes haue all things after    the manner of the Primitiue Church; then must they cleanse the leaprous, raise the dead, & worke miracles as the Apostles did. Fourthly, that the authors of the Presbyterie,    are arrogant, contentious, froward, and saucie fellowes. 
                           Bazilycon Doron. Pag 42. To which the Doctrine of our gracious soueraigne in his Bazilycon Doron, is right consonant; when he telleth vs very grauely, (besides many other vices which    he there reckeneth vp,) that we shall neuer finde with any Hic-land, or border-theeues, greater ingratitude, and moe lyes and vile periuries, then with this kinde of people. Fiftly, that they denie vnto Princes, authoritie to make ecclesiasticall lawes. Sixtly, that not the Presbyterie, but    the ciuill magistrates, kings, Emperours, Monarches, and other independant superiours, haue power to make canons and ordinances ecclesiasticall. Seuenthly, that whiles they    assigne vnto princes, onely the execution of their Lawes; they make of inferiours, superiours; and of subiects, Lawmakers: and so peruert the holy ordinance of God.

                     The gouernmēt of the church in the time of the Apostles,



was the best & most perfect. Ergo, no reason why it should be changed.
                  
                  
                     The Answere.
                     I answere; First, that the Church in the Apostles time    was most perfect indeed, concerning faith and doctrine absolutely; as also touching external gouernment, if regard be duly had vnto that time. Secondly, that there was not alwaies    in the Apostolicall time, one and the same externall gouernment of the Church, as is alreadie proued. Thirdly,    that the externall pollicie of the Church, may admit alteration and change without all preiudice of faith and conscience; according to the circumstances, of times, places, and persons. And consequently, that Christian Princes enioy this day very lawfully and laudably, the chiefe care and supreame ouer-sight thereof. Men of best account in the reformed Churches, doe in plaine tearmes approue and confirme this my doctrine. Maister Caluin hath these wordes; Scimus autem politiam pro varietate temporum recipere, imò 
                        
                           Caluin. in inst. lib. 4. cap. 7. §. 15. 
                        exigere varias mutationes. Wee knowe that the pollicie (of the Church) receiueth, yea requireth diuers alterations, according to the varietie of time.
                     Maister Musculus, a man of great zeale, singular learning, 
                           Musculus in locis, pag. 633. care and gifts, confirmeth Maister Caluins opinion in these words; The state of the Church was such at that time, that the ministers could not be chosen otherwise; because they then were without a Christian magistrate. If thou wilt call againe the manners of those times, thou must first call againe their state and condition. Againe, in an other place 
                           Vbi suprà, pag. 631. the same author writeth thus; I answere, that the Churches of God were at that time, destitute of a Godly and faithfull magistrate. Wherefore all iudgements betweene brethren & brethren, were then exercised by the Seniours in the ecclesiasticall senate; as the custome also was in those christian churches, which the Apostles planted. But the condition is farre otherwise in those Churches, which by the benefit



of God haue christian Princes and Magistrates, in whom resteth authoritie, power, law-making, and gouernance, not onely in prophane, but in holy things also. It is a most pestilent errour, that some thinke no otherwise of the christian magistrate, then of a prophane gouernance, whose power reacheth onely to things prophane. Haec ille.
                     
                     Maister Beza hath these golden wordes, We must not 
                           Beza in confession. cap. 5. sect. 35. simply looke or regard, what the Apostles did in the gouernment of the Church, seeing the circumstances are most diuers and variable, and therefore without preposterous zeale, Cacozelia all things cannot in all places and times, be called to one and the same forme or order, but rather the ende and inuariable purpose of them must bee looked vnto, and that manner and forme of doing things must be chosen, which tendeth directly thereunto. Haec Beza.
                     
                     Out of these most excellent and golden discourses of these great learned men, who were very famous and highly renowned in the best reformed churches. I gather these memorable obseruations. First, that the Church is not fixed    or tied, to any one setled kind of gouernment, but may be changed in her gouernance, as the circumstances of times, places, and persons shall require. Secondly, that it is    very fit and conuenient, sometimes to alter the gouernment of the church. Thirdly, that the church may not bee gouerned    now: as it was in those daies, when there were no christian magistrates. Fourthly, that wee must not respect so    much what the Apostles did, as their intent and purpose, the scope and marke which they aimed at.
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAP. XII. Of the discipline of the Church.
               
                  The first Section, of the multiplicitie of Church-discipline.
                  
                     THe Authors, Patrons, and seekers of the new English presbyterie, reckon vp three parts of church-discipline; viz, 1. ye election & abdication of ecclesiasticall officers, 2. the excommunication of the stubborne, and absolution of the repentant. 3. the decision of all such matters, as rise vp in the church, whether it be touching corrupt manners, or peruerse doctrine. For answere whereunto, marke the next Section.
               
               
                  The second Section, containing an answere vnto the former.
                  There is but one onely kind of publique church-discipline, which is called in the new testament, by the name of excommunication. I say (publique,) because I grant priuate admonition and reprehension, to be a certaine kind of priuate discipline. I say (church-discipline,) because I acknowledge also ciuill discipline. Discipline consisteth intrinsecally, in the punishing and correcting of vice. It is one part of the churches pollicie, farre different, from the election of ministers, and decision of controuersies.
               
               
                  The third Section of the essence, nature, and condition of church-discipline.
                  The Patrones of the English presbyterie, doe make it an essential part of the Gospell, so necessarie to saluation, as no Church can bee without it, but the truth is otherwise.



I proue it first, because S. Paul giueth a singular commendation to the Church of Corinth; although it wanted at 1. Cor. 1. that time the Church-discipline, which is excommunication. 1. cor. 5. Secondly, because we may stay and continue in that    Church, which is destitute of excommunication. Which Note wel the next Section. doubtlesse we could not doe, if excommunication were a part of Christs Gospell, and necessarie vnto saluation. For we must flee from that Church, which wanteth any thing necessarie to saluation. This notwithstāding, many learned men, euē of best accoūt in the reformed, churches do think

                      it lawfull to remaine in those Churches, where excommunication is not in vse. Maister Bullinger writing against the Anabaptists, hath these words; This the Anabaptists vrge, that there is no true Church acceptable vnto God, where there is no excommunication. To whom we answere, that the Church of Corinth was a true Church, and so acknowledged of Paul, before there was any vse of excommunication 
                        Gualter. in 1. cor. 5. v. 4. in it. The same doctrine is taught vniformely, of maister Caluin, maister Gualter, and others. Thirdly, wheresoeuer    the word of God is truly preached, and his Sacraments 
                        Caluin. lib. 4. instit. cap. 1. § 9. S. 10. lawfully administred, there is Christs Church vndoubtedly. For these are the true markes, by which best learned Writers discerne the Church of God. The case is euident enough, it is needelesse to spend much time about it. Vide sententiam Gualteri, in fine sectionis subsequentis.
                  
               
               
                  The fourth Section, of the persons that must excommunicate.
                  Excommunication precisely and chiefely pertaineth to the Church; and secondly to those to whom the Church hath cōmitted the execution thereof. I proue it by Christs 
                        Mat. 10. V. 15. 16. 17 mat. 5. v. 29. 30. owne wordes in his holy Gospell, where hee willeth his Disciples to tell the faults of their brethren, if they will not heare them vnto the Church, that is to say, vnto the whole congregation. And forthwith Christ addeth these wordes,



                     Verily I say vnto you, whatsoeuer ye bind on earth, shall be bound in heauen; and whatsoeuer yee loose on earth, shall be loosed in 
                     
                        Mat. 16. Vers. 19. Iohn. 20. Vers. 23. 
                     heauen. Againe, in an other place, he giueth the same authoritie of binding and loosing vnto Peter alone, which hee gaue in the other place to all the Apostles ioyntly. Thirdly, in an other place he giueth power to remit & retain sins, vnto his Disciples onely & soly. Out of which three seuerall commissions of our Lord Iesus, I gather and conceiue two generall rules and settled lawes. The one, that onely 
                        The 1. rule.
                      the successors of Christs Apostles and Disciples, haue the keyes of the kingdome of heauen; that is, of opening and shutting, of binding and loosing, of remitting and retaining sinnes; as also the power of excommunication, touching the vse and execution thereof. I say (touching the vse and execution thereof,) because it is one thing, to execute excommunication, and the keyes of heauen; an other thing, to commit the execution thereof to others. The other, that 
                        The 2. rule.
                      the whole Church hath authoritie, to commit the execution of the keyes and of excommunication, to some speciall persons fit for that purpose; for comlinesse and order sake, and for auoyding of confusion. This my resolution I Two things must be proued. will proue to be grounded vpon the doctrine of great learned men, highly renowned in the reformed Churches, two things I haue to proue; first, that the whole Church hath power to commit the keyes and excōmunication, to some certaine fit persons chosen for that end and purpose. Secondly, that onely the Ministers of the word & Sacramēts, can denounce the sentence and put the same in execution. Concerning the former, Maister Bullinger hath a long and learned discourse, which is able to satisfie any indifferent Reader. These are his expresse wordes; caeterum video controversum inter quosdam nostri aevi homines, &c. But I perceiue it is a controuersie among certaine men of our age, 
                        Bullinger. in 1 cor. 5. pag. 47. who should haue power to punish sinne, and to execute the discipline of the Church; some ascribing it to the whole Church, other some to speciall men chosē for that purpose. Doubtlesse, I cannot perceiue, that they offend, who giue



this power to certain men chosē for that end, wtout doubt, they doe not offend against Gods word. But they obiect, if he shal not heare you, tel it to the church. Now some chosē men are not the church. But these men perceiue not, that Christ & his Apo. vsed the figure Synecdoche. For Paul saith you being gathered with my spirit. And in the latter Epistle, he saith; it is sufficient to the same man, that he was rebuked 2. Cor. 2. Verse. 6. of many. If they wil stand vpon Christs words (literally) we wil see when they wil bring the whole church together. But we speake, (say they,) of the particular Church. We therfore haue the victory, who say that Christ vsed the figure Synecdoche. We graunt, that this power is giuen to the whole Church, but we call the congregation of good men the Church. For it followeth forthwith, in the very words of our lord; where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the mids of them. Therfore, if Christ, as they graunt, committed the ecclesiasticall discipline to a particular church, & two or three, & much more eight or twelue, make a particular church: what letteth, that christ cōmitted not the same to chosen men, who are consecrate to Christs name? seeing the authoritie of ecclesiasticall discipline, is more intiere & renowned among chosen godly men, then among the confused vulgar sort, who as they lack iudgement, so are they often carried away with affections. Haec Bullingerus.
                  
                  Maister Gualter hath these words, potestatis christi meminit 
                     
                        Gualter in 1. cor. 5. v, 4. 
                     alludeut ad mat. 18. ne ille ecclesie sententiā cōtemneret et hoc iubet, quiatunc non erat alia tales coercendi, quādo magistratus non erant christiani, ali

                        Leu. 20. 
                     Pauius obstitisset, vt apparet ex Rom 13. quia vero durūerat, homines christianos Ethnicis obijcere, recurrit ad remedium quod christus dedit quoad iniurias privatas, mat. 18. sequitur potestas illa penes q

                        os erat? penes totā ecclesiā, quae tamē (ne cōfusio fieret) per delectos agebat ex senioribus. Sequitur; excommunicatio. n. non est ex necessarijs illis, sine quibus ecclesia non consistit.
                  
                  He made mention of the power of Christ alluding to his wordes in Mathew, least he should contemne the sentence



of the church. And he cōmandeth this to be done, because they had no other meanes at that time, to correct the disobedient, when there were no christian Magistrates. Otherwise this fellowe, should haue bin punished according to the law. Neither would Paul haue bin against it, as appeareth by his doctrine to the Romans. But because it was a very hard case to send Christians to Ethnickes, he hath recourse to that remedie, which Christ appointed for priuate iniuries and in whom was that power? in the whole Church, which for all that, (to auoid cōfusion,) did execute the same by chosen seniours. For excommunication is none of those necessary things, without which the church cannot consist.
                  The same Doctor in an other place, hath these expresse 
                        Gualter. in 1. cor. 12. hom. 104 in fine.
                      words; Hodie non, opus proprio seuatu ecclesiae. Agnoscamus beneficium dei, Esa. 49. vicissim hi aguoscant se quoque mēmbra esse ecclesiae. Sequitur, nobis sufficiat habere pastores, scholas, magistratus pios, qui cuitum dei tueantur pauperes curent.
                  
                  We haue this day no need at all of the senate of the church or presbyterie. Let vs acknowledge the goodnes of God, and let them likewise acknowledge themselues, to be the members of the church. Let it suffice vs, to haue Pastors, Schooles, godly Magistrates, that will defend the worship of God, and take care of the poore.
                  Maister Martyr deliuereth the same doctrine in substāce, 
                        Martyr in. 1. cor. 16 pag. 239. in these expresse words; fatemur deinde, claves ecclesiae vniversae datas, caeterum ne confusio accidat; convenit, vt aliqui ex omnibus deligantur quivtantur clavibus, quarum vsus in omnes redundet qui christo credun̄t. Prepositos vero ecclesiarum habent des monet Paulus non semel, et christus non prohibuit, qui cum iussit ne magistri et Rabbi vocaremur, ambitionē repressit, voluitque, vt nemo nostrum haec affectaret. Sed non interdixit, quin habeamus in honore, et appellemus honorifice, quos dominus nobis praefecit: imo Paulus ad Timotheum scribit, se positum esse magistrum gentium. Wee likewise confesse, that the keyes 1. Tim. 2. Uers. 7. are giuen to the whole Church. But, to auoyde confusion; it is meete, that some out of all bee chosen, who may putt the keyes in vse: whose vse re doundeth to all that beleeue in Christ. Now, that we must



haue gouernours of Churches, Paule admonisheth more then once, & Christ did not forbid it; who, when he cōmanded vs, not to be called Maisters and Rabbies, repressed ambition, being desirous, that none of vs should hunt after these things. But he neuer forbad vs, to reuerence and giue honourable names to those whom our Lord hath placed ouer vs. Yea, Paul writeth to Timothy, that himselfe was made the maister of the gentiles.
                  Maister Musculus is consonant to the rest, whose expresse wordes are these; denique curabit vt plebs ipsa viros graues, 
                     
                        Musculus in locis, de ministris ver. dei, Pag. 204. 
                     timentes dei, ac boni testimonij deligant, quorum cura et vigilantia disciplina ecclesiae administretur, et si quid grauioris momenti accidat, ad ipsam ecclesiam referatur. Haec tamen omnia, quae ad indeterminatam potestatem referimus, ad illas tan tum pertinent ecclesias, quae christianum magistratum non habent, quales erant olim, priusquam principes christiani fierent.
                  
                  Finally, he shall prouide that the people choose graue men, which feare God and haue a good report, by whose care and painfull labours the Church discipline may be executed, and if any thing of greater moment fall out, that the same be referred to the Church. Yet all these things, which we referre to the power vndetermined, pertaine to those Churches onely, which have no Christian Magistrate, such as they were sometime, before there were Christian Princes.
                  The same Doctor in an other place, hath these wordes; Hanc cuiusvis. Particularis ecclesiae potestatem, reprobos scilicet excommunicands, Romanus pontifex irritam reddidit, & e medio 
                     
                        Musculus de eccles. pag. 311. 
                     sustulit.
                  
                  This power of excommunication, which pertained to euery particular Church, the bishop of Rome made frustrate, and tooke it quite away.
                  Out of these most learned discourses of these graue Writer, I obserue these memorable lessons for the benefit    of the reader. First, that the power to excommunicate, is giuen to the whole Church. Secondly, that the Church hath    power to commit the same to others, as it shall be thought



meete for her good. Thirdly, that the Church for auoiding of confusion, did euer commit this iurisdiction, to some speciall    persons fit for the same. Fourthly, that the common    vulgar sort want iudgement, and are often carried away with affections, and so are vnfit persons to retaine such iurisdiction in their hands. Fiftly, that excommunication is    not any assentiall part of the Church. Sixtly, that the moderation    and chiefe power of disposing and committing, resteth principally in the Christian Magistrate, where the church receiueth such a blessing. And thus much of the former part; viz. of the power of the whole Church. Let vs proceede to the latter part; viz, to whom the church hath committed this power.
                  Concerning this Latter member, it is to be holden for an vndoubted truth, and most Catholique doctrine; that none saue onely lawfull Ministers of Gods word and Sacraments, can lawfully denounce the sentence of excommunication. For this cause was it, that when our Lord Iesus gaue this authoritie to his whole church; he gaue it alwaies 
                        Mat. 16. Mat: 18. Iohn. 20. in the name, either of all, or of some one of his Apostles. And for the same cause was it, that the Church hath euer since committed the same, vnto her lawfull Bishops and Ministers of the word. The practise of the Church is most cleere and apparant, both by the councels, and by the vniforme verdict of the holy fathers.
               
               
                  Ex concilijs.
                  This case is most apparant by the old canons, comōonly (for their antiquitie) called the canons of the Apostles. There I finde these expresse wordes; siquis presbyter, 
                     
                        Can. 32. Apostol.
                      
                     aut diaconus, ab episcopo suo segregetur, hunc non licere ab alio recipi, sed ab ipso quieum sequestraverat; nisi forsitan obierit apiscopus ipse, qui eum segregare cognoscitur,
                  
                  If any Priest or Deacon be excommunicated of his Bishop, it shall not be lawfull for any other to receiue him, but onely the partie who seperated him; vnlesse perchance the Bishop die, that did excommunicate him. By this canon



it is euident, that none but the Bishoppe vsed to excommunicate, and yet the same Canon is confirmed, as very authenticall, both by the councell of Antioch, and by the 
                        Conc. nican. can. 5. conc. antioch. can. 6 Conc. Sardic. can. 16. first councell of Nice, celebrated in the time of Constantine the great.
                  The auncient and famous councel of Sardica, hath these wordes; Hoc quoque omnibus placeat, vt siue diaconus, siue presbyter, siue quis clericorum ab episcopo suo communione fuerit privatus, et ad alterum perrexerit episcopum, et scierit ille ad quem confugit, cum ab episcopo suo fuisse abiectum, non opertere vt ei communionem indulgeat.
                  
                  Let vs all agree hereunto, that if a Deacon, or a Priest, or any of the Cleargie be excōmunicated of his own Bishop, and shall flee to an other Bishop, then he may not giue him the communion, if he knewe that his owne Bishop did excommunicate him.
                  The secōd councell holden at Carthage, hath these words; 
                        Conc. Carthage. 2. can. 8. 
                     Placet, vt si presbyter excommunicatut, aut correctus a suo episcopo, sacrificare praesumpserit, anathematizetur.
                  
                  We agree, that if a Priest being excommunicated, or punished by his owne Bishop, shall presume to celebrate, accursed be that man. And the selfe same decree is to be read, 
                        Conc. carthage. 6. can. 10. in the sixt councell of Carthage.

                     Alezander that godly and famous Bishop of Alexandria, did by himselfe alone excommunicate Arrtus, as both Sozomenus

                     Alexander did both excommunicate Arrius, and all the clerkes that held his opinion. Yea this was a rule so receiued, and a practise so common in the auncient Churches; that when a controuersie arose about the celebration of Easter. 
                        A. D. 183. 
                     Victor that zealous Bishop of Rome about one thousand and foure hundred yeares agoe, would haue excōmunicated all the Bishops of Aus
                           •
                        ; if Irenaeus the good Bishop of Lyons, had not disswaded him from that attempt.
                  
                     The first Obiection.
                     Saint Paul did not alone excommunicate the incestuous 1. Cor. 5. v. 4. 
                        Corinthian, but together with the whole congregation. For he saith, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit.
                  
                  
                     The Answere.
                     I answere, first, that though Christ gaue the keyes, and 
                           Mat. 16. Mat. 18. Mat. 28. Ioh. 20. the power of remitting and retaining sinnes vnto the whole Church: yet did he commit the vse and execution of that power, vnto his Apostles and their successors til the worlds end. Secondly, that the Apostle himselfe alone did excommunicate the Corinthian, and required the presence of the people no otherwise, then the same is this day required in our English Churches, viz that the sentence be pronounced in the hearing of the congregation, that they may therby auoid his companie that is excommunicated, and be terrified from the like offence. I proue it, because Saint Paules words are these; for I verely as absent in body, but present 
                           Vbi supr. Uers. 3. in spirit, haue determined alreadie as though I were present. By which words it is most apparant, that the determination of the matter resteth onely in himself, and not in the people. For otherwise, he could not haue dicided the matter in their absence, and without their assent. And it is confirmed 2. Tim. 4. Vers. 14. 15. 2. Tim. 2. 17. to be thus, because he alone excommunicated Alexander the Copper Smith, and the same may bee thought probably, of Hymeneus and Philetus.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     The second Obiection.
                     
                        Theodosius confessed his fault before the congregation, and asked forgiuenesse of the same, and thereupon was obsolued. And so it appeareth, that Ambrose alone did not excommunicate the Emperour.
                  
                  
                     The Answere.
                     It is the vsuall practise in our English Church, that no excommunicate person be receiued into the Church again, vntill he haue made publike confession, and asked pardon for his offence. And this notwithstanding, the Bishop alone doth excommunicate, as S. Ambrosius did the Emperour.
                     
                        The Replie.
                        You say, that the execution of excommunication, pertaineth onely to the successours of the Apostles; & so consequently, it must pertaine to all Ministers of Gods holy Word and Sacraments; and not onely to your lordly Bishops.
                     
                     
                        The Answere.
                        
                           I answere; first, that no such consequence can be inferred vpon my graunt. For though I graunt, and that truly, that    none but Ministers of Gods word and Sacraments, can lawfully denounce the sentence of excommunication; yet will it not follow thereupon, that I giue the same power to euery Minister in generall. For it is one thing to say, that none but Ministers can doe it; an other thing to affirme, that euery Minister Promiscuè may doe it. Secondly, that    all Ministers haue power habituall to excommunicate; but All ministers haue habitual, but not actuall power. those Ministers onely haue actuall power to doe it, to whō the Church hath committed that iurisdiction. For seeing the Church hath all the power graunted to her dispensation,



shee may giue to this or that Minister more or lesse, as shall be thought conuenient in her discretion.
                     
                  
               
            
            
               CHAP. XIII. Of Preaching and other things coincident.
               
                  The first Section, of the vocation of Ministers, which cannot Preach.
                  
                     ALthough it were to be wished, that all Ministers of Gods worde and Sacraments, should be able to Preach, and to deuide Gods word aright vnto the people, yet where and when sufficient men of that abilitie cannot be had, others of meaner talents and honest behauiour may not be reiected. And to hold that none may be ordered and admitted, to administer the Sacraments and to reade the Scriptures and godly Prayers in the Church, for the comfort and edisication of the people, is not onely against Christs institution, but also against the vsual practise of the church in all ages. Neither is it possible, to alledge for the ground of the contrarie opinion, either any sound reason out of holy Writ, or any one testimonie of any of the holy fathers, or any canon out of any ancient councell. The latter member, viz. that it is against the continuall practise of the church, is as cleere as the Sunneshning at noone day; & therfore I deem it a thing needlesse, to spend wordes in that behalfe. The former member, viz. that it is against Christs holy ordinance, I prooue out of Christs owne words in his last supper, when he said to his Disciples; Hoc facitè in mei memoriam. Doe this in my remembrance. 
                        Luke. 22. Vers. 19. By these wordes, as all the holy fathers and Doctors affirme constantly, Christ made his Apostles Priests or Ministers, giuing them power and authoritie onely


                     
                     to consecrate the blessed Sacrament of his body and blood, and to deliuer the same vnto his people. Neither could they lawfully, haue either baptized, or preached, remitted, and retained sinnes, vntill they had receiued further authoritie so to doe; which was not granted to them indeede, vntill Christs glorious resurrection. Whereupon it followeth by a necessarie and ineuitable consequ
                        •
                     tion, which neuer can be answered; that the 
                        Mat. 28. V. 19. Iohn. 20. V. 22. Preaching of GODS word and the administration of his holy Sacraments, are not so inseperably vnited and linked together, but that the one may stand intiere and pe
                        •
                     fect without the other. For Christs will and holy ordinance is that onely rule, by which and after which, all the actions, policie, and gouernment of his Curch, must be measured, ordered, and disposed.
                  And this reason ab authoritate legislatoris, is confirmed by an other argument drawen ab exemplo. Wedlocke or Marriage instituted for a triple ende; viz. for procreation of 
                        Gen. 1. 28. Gen. 2. 18. 1. Cor. 7. 2. children, for the avoyding of fornication, and for mutuall helpe and societie, is perfect and lawfull for the secondarie ends, though the first cannot be atchieued. For marriage is lawfull in old women, quib, desinunt muliedria, which 
                        Gen. 18. 11. are past the date of bearing children, as all learned men doe graunt. Ergo, the institution and ordering of Priests or Ministers for a triple end; viz. for Preaching of Gods word 
                        Luke. 22. 19. Mat. 28. 19. Act. 13. 15. Iac. 5. 14. for administration of his holy Sacraments, and for reading of the holy Scriptures & godly prayers, for the comfort & edification of the congregation, is godly perfect, & lawfull for the last & second ends, albeit the first cānot be attained.
                  The same argument is further confirmed, by the testimonie 
                        Confess helv sect. 11. cap. 18. pag. 38. of the reformed churches in Helvetia; whose iudgement I think, the patrones of the English desired presbyterie, wil not easily reiect or cōdemne. Their expres words are these; domnanius ministros ineptos, & non instructos donis pastori necessarijs. Interim agnos
                           •
                        omus quorundam in veteri ecclesia pastorum simplicitatem innocuam, plus aliquando profuisse ecclisiae, quam quorundam eruditionem variam, exquisitam, delicatamque sed


                     
                     paulo fastuo siorem. Vnde ne hodie quidem reijcimus simplicitatem quorundam probam nec tamen omuino imperitam.
                  
                  We condemne vnmeete Ministers, which are not indewed with gifts necessarie for a shepeheard. Howbeit, we acknowledge, that the harmelesse simplicitie of some shepheards in the olde Church, did sometime more profit the Church, then the great, exquisite, and delicate, but a little to proud learning of some others. Wherefore we reiect not now adayes, the good simplicitie of certaine Ministers, so that they be not altogether ignorant. Loe, the great learned men, the maisters and rulers of the reformed Churches in Helvetia, allow and approue as much as we desire. The cass is cleere, it cannot be denied.
                  
                     The first Obiection.
                     Saint Paul commandeth expressely, that euery Bishop 1. Tim. 3. v. 2. 3. Tit. 1. v. 7. 8. 9 or pastor should be able to teach, and to conuince the gainsayers; Ergo, no mortal man can dispense with vnpreaching Ministers.
                  
                  
                     The Answere.
                     I answere; first, that if euery pastor must of necessitie be    able to conuince the gainsayers, so as otherwise he cānot be a lawfull pastor; then doubtlesse must many of those, who are of high esteeme with the fauourrs of the presbyterie, be vtterly forsaken, and deposed from their ministery. Secondly,    that hospitalitie is required in a Minister, euen as is his preaching and aptnesse to conuince. And yet many pastors are allowed within the presbyterie, which for all that can keepe no hospitalitie. Thirdly, that by Saint Pauls canons    he is as vnlawfull a Pastor that is an angry Minister, as he that cannot Preach. For Saint Pauls wordes are as plaine for the one, as they are for the other, me orgilon, not angrie. But if all bee vnlawfull Pastors, that be angrie; howe can wee bee assured to finde any lawfull 
                           Tit. 1. 7. Pastors, either in the presbyterie, or else where? Many other



conditions doth Saint Paul require in pastors, which will hardly be found in the elders of the Presbyterie. The true sense and meaning of Saint Paules wordes is this, and no other; viz. that it is meete and conuenient, that a Pastor of the Church haue those qualities and conditions which he reckoneth; but withall he meaneth nothing lesse, then that he is no lawfull Pastor, which wanteth some of the saide conditions. Yea, the originall Greeke word, doth confirme this mine exposition. For, deioun ton Episcopon doth onely signifie vnto vs, that a Bishop or Priest should of congruitie, and if it may be, haue such conditions and qualities, as the Apostle reckoneth vp to Titus and Timothy; not, that none can be true and lawfull pastors of the Church, which 1. Tim. 3. 2. are not indewed with all the aforenamed qualities. No, no, the latin word, (oportet,) and the Greeke word, (dei) haue no other sense and meaning; but that it behooueth, or that it is meete and conuenient; not, that it must of necessitie be so, or else no lawfull ordination.
                  
                  
                     The second Obiection.
                     Christ sent his Disciples forth to preach the kingdome of God, and to cure the sicke. 
                           Luke. 9. 2.
                     
                  
                  
                     The Answere.
                     I answere, that this was a speciall charge giuen onely to the Apostles, and that it proueth as well, that all Ministers must be curers of diseases, as Preachers and conuincers of gainsayers.
                  
               
               
                  The second Section, of Preaching without licence and authoritie.
                  The patrons of the Presbyterie affirme those canons, ordinances, and constitutions, to be vngodly, wicked, and plaine diabolicall; which prohibite all Ministers to preach



Gods word, that are not lawfully licenced thereunto. And they cry out against the most reuerend Fathers; because they put som to silence, whom they had licenced to preach in former times.
                  But I answere to these vnworthy complaints, and vnchristian    exclamations; first, that no man may take vpon 
                        Rom. 10. 15. Hebr. 5 4. him the ministerie, but he onely that is lawfully called therunto. Secondly, that the Church, to whom this authoritie    is graunted, may place and displace, giue licence to preach, and prohibite from preaching; as it shall be thought most conuenient for the peaceable gouernment thereof, and for edification of the people. For this cause did King Salomon Depose Abiathar the high Priest, and placed Sadock in his 1. reg. 2. v. 27. roome. But doubtlesse, he that hath power to displace the Minister, which is a greater thing; hath power, a fortiori, to suspend the Minister from execution, or to prohibite him 
                        Vide sect. 4. ex concil. Vasensi, et notato. Vide supra, cap. 12. sect. 4. ex. Musculo.
                      to Preach; seeing that is a thing, that requireth lesse authoritie. Againe, if the Church had not power to displace, suspend, and prohibite Ministers from Preaching, as their demeanours, and circumstances of times, places, and persons shall require; then doubtlesse would the Church abound, with schismes, confusion, and all ataxia contrarie to the Apostolike canon, which prescribeth all things to be done decently and in order. Yea, I protest vnto the world, that I deeme the prohibition of Preaching without licence, to be 1. Cor. 14. v. 26, 40. one of the most necessary and profitable Canons, that euer were ordained, constituted, and established, by this our English Church. For since euery man tooke vpon him to Preach at his owne pleasure, and was permitted to doe it when and where he would; lawfull authoritie hath binso impugned, new-sangled conceits so vsuall, vnsound doctrine so cōmō, & the text it self either scantly touched or so rawly & vnclerkly handled; that the auditors were as ignorant of the true meaning of the text in the end, as in the beginning of the sermon. Hereupon it followed of necessitie, that some for want of skil, (who euer were most desirous to



haue the place,) some for disdaine of superioritie in their betters; and others vpon licentious saucinesse; did destroy more, and withdrawe moe people from liking of the Gospell in one moueth, then graue Preachers of great learning and rare gifts, were able to builde vp againe in one whole yeare. I will not disclose all I knowe in this behalfe, for that I haue no pleasure therein. Onely I wish, that all Preachers will hereafter studie seriously how and what to Preach, before they take in hand that most excellent and heauenly exercise. And so I wil conclude this section, with the graue censure of Maister Musculus. His 
                        Musculus de ministris verbi dei, pag. 202. words are these; Habent ministri Christi indeterminatam quandam potestatem, quam in ijs rebus esse dicimus, de quibus nihiless expresso verbo determinatūa domin
                           •
                        ; & tamen aliqua ratione ad hoc conducunt, vt ministerium ipsorum velcōmodius, vel vtilius impleatur.
                  
                  The ministers of Christ haue a certaine vndetermined power, which consisteth in those things, of which our lord hath determined nothing expressely in his word; and yet the same things serue to this end, that their Ministerie may be either more commodiously, or more profitably accomplished. Loe, the Church hath power & freedome to order 
                        Vide supra. cap. 12. sect. 4. ex eodem.
                      those things, which our Lord hath not expreslely determined in his holy word. Now, it is most euident and apparent, to all that read the Scriptures, that our Lord hath not expressely appointed this minister, and that minister, when where, and in what habit he shall preach, and consequently, the disposition and ordering thereof, pertaineth to the gouernours of the Church.
               
               
                  The third Section, of reading of Homilies in the Church.
                  The reading of learned Homilies in the Church, pronounced by vnpreaching Ministers, (so termed scornfully) are vehemently impugned, by the patrons of the long expected presbyterie. To whom I answere; first, that father Lati
                           ••
                        r that blessed Martyr, compiled a whole booke of



godly and learned Sermons, (my selfe haue seene the same) which hee would neuer haue done, if hee had thought it a thing vnlawfull, to read or pronounce his Sermons in the Pulpit. The like may be said of Saint Augustine, Saint Ambrose, and many others, whose Sermons are this day extant in print, in the greater part of Europe. Secondly, that the distinct reading, of one of the godly and learned sermons    or homilies, setforth to be read in our English Churches, is able to edifie, and no doubt doth edifie the congregation more; then doe many of their sermons, who inueigh most bitterly against vnpreaching ministers. But these men are therefore enemies to reading, because they are carried away with a vaine Philantia, and loue nothing better, then to heare thēselues talking. For which end they wander abroad many times, leauing their owne charges either distitute, or onely supplied by vnpreaching Ministers, whom otherwise they condemne. And this they effect with desire, euen in those places, where their presence is neither necessary, nor yet much desired. I speake not this, either in defence of vnpreaching ministers, (for I wish with all my hart, that euery church in England, were furnished with a godly learned preacher) or in dislike of their zeale, who endeuoure themselues to preach often; so that be done with eutaxia, & obediēce of higher powers, & with such reuerence, ripenes, & due preparatiō, as appertaineth to that heauēly exercise. Thirdly, that one of the homilies or sermons aforenamed,    pronounced by an vnpreaching minister, (as they odiously tearme him,) is intrinsecally and formally a sermon, or a preaching, & consequently, that he is truly said to preach, who publikely and orderly pronounceth the same, I proue it, because to be vttered with a shrill or meane voyce, with this or that gesture, vpon the booke or without the booke, and other like circumstances, are all and euery of them mere accidentall and extrinsecall to a Sermon, Whosoeuer shal hold the contrary opinion, must perforce admit grosse absurdities, flat contradictions, and plaine impossibilities.



Fourthly, if an vnlearned Minister shall receiue a learned Sermō, learnedly & orderly pēned by his learned friend, & shall cunne the same without the booke, and after the rehearsall of his text, shall pronounce the same distinctly and orderly in the Pulpit; all the learned that heare him, and know not the truth of the matter, will say, (and that truly) that he made a learned Sermon, although he were but calvus comatus, in rei veritate. And euen so say I; that he preacheth in the Pulpit, who readeth Homilies penned to his hand. Howsoeuer that be; this is out of doubt; that many reading the Homilies doe more edifie the congregation, then many others that preach their owne collections, (I will not say inuentions and fansies,) and thinke themselues no fooles. It is likewise out of doubt, that the same Ministers doe preach Theologica, though not theolagicè; and consequently, that is accōplished by them, which is principally

                  The fourth Section, of reading of the Apocrypha in the Church.
                  The patrons of the presbyterie make most bitter exclamations, against the reading of the Apocryphall bookes in the Church, and they haue preuailed so farre with some of the simple sort and vulgar people, that they will not once vouchsafe to reade or looke vpon those Bibles, which haue the Apocrypha in them. To whom I hope in God so to answere, as shall be able to satisfie them, if they will be satisfied with reason. I Therfore say first, that the word apocryphos in the original Greek tongue, signifieth hid or secret; and thereupon certaine books contained within the corps of the holy Bible, and deliuered to the primitiue and auncient Churches succeeding, were called Apocrypha, for that they were not acknowledged of the Church to be canonicall, that is to say, to be the canon or rule of faith, as the other



Scriptures are. Secondly, that these Apocryphall bookes were euer in high esteeme in the Church of God, as the holy wrytings of holy men; and were also thought meete to be read in the Churches, as containing sit and necessarie matter, aswell for the knowledge of the hystories, as for the instruction of Godly manners. This to bee so, will bee cleare and euident to all those, that can and

                  Saint Hierome hath these expresse words: Si

                  As therefore the Church readeth the books of Iudith, and of Tobye, and of the Machabees, but receyueth them not amongst the Canonicall Scriptures: so doth it also reade these two volumes for edification of the people, but not to confirme any Ecclesiasticall doctrine.
                  Saint Augustine is of the same opinion, and deliuereth the matter in these expresse words: Hanc Scripturam quae

                  The Scripture which is of the Machabees, the Iewes repute not as they doe the Lawe, and the Prophets, and the



Psalmes, to which the Lord gaue testimonie, as to his witnesses, saying, It behooued all things to be fulfilled, which are written in the Lawe, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalmes of mee: but the Church hath receiued it not without profite, if it bee read or heard soberly: especially for those Machabees, who for the Lawe of God, as true Martyrs, suffred of their persecutors so vnworthy and horrible torments.
                  Saint Cyprian, Saint Ambrose, and other Fathers, teache the same Doctrine; and the continuall practise of the Churche in all ages, doth yeelde a constant testimonie therevnto.
                  Nowe, seeing the Churche of God hath thought it meete and profitable, to haue the Apocryphall books read in the Church; and seeing withall, that Saint Austen Saint Hierome, and other holy Fathers, do commend the same, I see no reason, why a few young heads without gray beards, (whose authoritie is no waye comparable with the practise of the Church neither their reading, experience, and iudgement, to bee equalized with the auncient & holy Fathers) should take vppon them so rashly to controll the Churche of England, and to condemne her for following the practise of the Church in all ages. Let these men weigh well with themselues; what the holy, most reuerend, and learned Father, Saint Austen saith, to this and the like questions. These are his expresse words; In his. n. rebus de quibus nihil certi statuit Scriptura Diuina, mos populi Dei, vel instituta maiorum pro lege tenenda sunt. For in those things,

Episto. 86. touching which the holie Scritpure hath left no certaine rule; the custome of Gods people, and the ordinances of our ancestours, must be holden for a lawe. Behold here (gentle Reader,) a most excellent rule indeed, giuen vs by this holie Father and great learned Doctor. Which, if they, who this day impugne the governement of our English Church, (the Prownists and their 
                        ••
                     herents I euer meane,) would duely ponder and regarde; they would



doubtlesse surceasse to vexe and distourbe the peace of our Church, and receyue the ordinances of their auncestours, with all reuerence and humilitie. For the Church of England doth make a flat separation, in which it doth in plain and expresse tearms, seuer & deuide the Canonicall books from the Apocryphall; so as no simple Reader, can but perceyue and vnderstand the same. And it is not to the purpose, to obiect as some haue done: that the Rubricke in the booke of common prayer, calleth the Apocryphall bookes holy Scripture. For first, when the Rubrick saith (the rest of the holie Scripture,) it may be vnderstood fitlie, of the bookes Canonicall following; especially, seeing it nameth not the Apocryphal expressely, but quoteth some of them afterwards. Secondly, the Apocrypha may truely and lawfully beecalled holie Scripture Analogicè, though Analogice nō autē vnivocè. not Univocè; that is to say, the wrytings of holy men, or bookes conteyning holie and good matter. And in this sense speaketh the Rubrick, as I iudge; and sundry of the holie Fathers, I am well assured, doe so tearme the bookes Apocryphall. Howsoeuer the Rubricke be expounded, or wrested, two things are apparant. Th' one, that the Rubricke doth not call them Canonicall scripture. Th' other, that the Church meaneth not to equalize them, with the Canonicall books of holy writ. I prooue it, because shee hath plainely distinguished the one from the other, and preferred the authoritie of the Canonicall. Neyther will it serue their turne to say, as some haue done; viz. That nothing may be read in the Church, but onely the Canonicall scriptures. For first, no text of holy writ doth so affirme; 1. and consequently, the Church hath power to determine thereof, as is alreadie prooued. Secondlie, the ancient 2. councell of Uasco, (which was holden aboue one 
                        Cont. Uascense. can. 4. thousand and one hundreth yeares agoe,) decreed plainlie in their publique assembly, that the Deacons should read the Homelies made by the holy Fathers. These are the expresse words of the Councell; Hoc etiam pro aedificatione


                     
                     omnium Ecclesiarum, & pro vtilitate totius populi nobis placuit, vt non solum in Ciuitatibus, sedetiam in omnibus parochijs verbum faciendi daremus Presbyteris Potestatem: ua, vt si presbyter aliqua infirmitate prohibente, per seipsum non potuerit praedicare, Sanctorum Patrum Homiliae a Diaconis recitentur.
                  
                  Wee haue also decreed for the edification of all Churches, and for the good of all the people, that the Priests should bee licenced to preache, and not in Cities onely, but Beholde here licence graū
                        ted to preach. also in euery Parish Churche; so that the Deacons may read the Homilies of the holy Fathers, if the Priest cannot preache himselfe, by reason of some infirmitie. Thirdly, it is voyde of all reason, and farre from all Christianitie, to .3. affirme it vnlawfull to read testimonialls, made to signifie the distresse of our honest Neighbours; that thereby wee may bee styrred vppe, to releeue them more bountifullie, Yea, (if it be true that some haue written,) it is a lawe amongst them of the Presbyterie, to haue their orders for gouerning the Church, reade publicklie once euery quarter. And I knowe Expropria scientia, that some of them, haue done more. Well, now-adayes euery vpstart yongling, that can rawely pronounce some Texts of the holie Byble (though hee but meanely conceyue the true sense,) will roundly take vpon him (I warrant you) to reuile our most Reuerend Fathers, the Archbyshops & Byshoppes, and to controll the gouernement of our Churche, as if hee had a Commission from Heauen to doe it. If I should disclose, what my selfe haue heard herein, and how I haue beene saluted sometimes, for speaking my minde in the defence of the Reuerend Fathers, and of the Godly setled Lawes of this Church of England: time would sooner faile mee, then matter whereof to speake.
               
            
            
               
               CHAP. XIIII. Of certaine extrauagants very offensino to the Patrons of the Presbyterie,
               
                  The first member, of Christs Baptisme, and the circumstances thereof.
                  
                     IT is sharply reprooued, that the booke of common prayer, hath in it these wordes; that by the Baptisme of his welbeloued Sonne, God did sanctifie the floud Iordane, and all other waters, In the first prayer of Baptisme. to the mysticall washing away of sinne. By these words, (say they) the Minister is caused to testifie of God, that hee hath done that which hee neuer did. For answere herevnto, I say first, that I .I. wonder at the temerarious audacitie of these men, who presume to set abroach, Quie quid in buccam venerit. Truly saith th' Apostle of such qualified people; they would bee Doctours of the Lawe, and yet vnderstand not what they 1. Tim. 1. 7. speake, neither whereof they affirme. Secondlie, that if .2. maister Caluin say traielie, as he saith most truelie in deede; Caluin. in arg. in Epist. ad Galaethat. that it is a pestileut mischief, when the maner of one church, must bee made a Lawe to all the rest. Then doubtlesse may I say truely; that it is a mere pestilent mischiefe, when the gouernment of all the Churches in a whole Monarchy; must be squared and measured by the fancie and conceyte of euery priuate man. Thirdlie, that when our Sauiour Christ was baptized in Iordan, of his precursor Saint Iohn: 
                     .3. then did he sanctifie all waters, for the mysticall washing away 
                        Mat. 3. v. 13. of sinne. Neither is this mine opinion onely, neither yet the Doctrine of the Church of England onely; but it is the constant and vniforme affirmance of the holy Fathers. Tertullianus, (whose rare learning Saint Cyprian admyred,



and therefore was daily conuersant with his works,) giueth this censure of Christs Baptisme in Iordan. Baptizato. n. Christo, idest sanctificante aquas in suo baptismate, omnis plenitudo 
                     
                        Tertullianus aduers. Iu-daeos pa. 134. 
                     spiritalium retro Charismatum in Christo cessauit. For when Christ was baptized, that is to say, when Christ sanctified the waters in his Baptisme, then all the fulnesse of former spirituall gifts ceased in Christ.
                  Saint Hylarie hath these words: Non ille necessitatem habuit abluendi sed per illum in aquis ablutionis nostrae erat sanctificanda purgatio. Sequitur. Atque ita & Prophetae testimonio 
                     
                        Hylarius in matt. can. 2. 
                     lauacro non eget, & exempli sui authoritate Humanae salutis Sacramenta consummat, hominem & assumptoine sactificans & lauacro.
                  
                  Hee stoode in no neede of washing; but in the waters of our washing, hee was to sanctifie our purgation. And so both by the testimonie of the Prophet, hee needeth no washing: and by the authoritie of his example, hee doth consummate the Sacraments of Mans saluation, sanctifying Man both in his assumption, and in his washing.
                  Saint Ambrose is consonant to the rest, and deliuereth his minde in these words: Baptizatus est ergo Dominus, non mundaeri volens, sed mundare aquas, vt ablutae per carnem 
                     
                        Ambros. in Luc. lib. 2. cap. 2. 
                     Christi quae peccatum non cognouit, baptismatis ius haberent.
                  
                  Our Lord therefore was baptized, not desiring to bee purged, but to cleanse the waters, that they beeing washed by the flesh of Christ, which knew no sinne, might enioy the right of baptisme.
                  Saint Hierome hath these words: Ipse Dominus noster Iesus Christus. qui non tam mundatus est in lauacro, quam lauacro suo vniuersas aquas mundauit, statim vt caput extulit de fluento spiritum sanctum accepit, non quod vnquam sine spiritis 
                     
                        Hieron. aduer. Lucifer. tom. 3. 
                     sancto fuerit, quippe qui de spiritu sancto in carne natus est; sed vt illud nobis monstraretur verum esse baptisma, quo spiritus sanctus adueniat.
                  
                  Our Lord Iesus Christ, who rather cleansed all waters by his washing, then receiued any cleansing, came no



sooner out of the floud, but hee receiued the Holy Ghost: not that hee was any time without the Holy Ghost, who was conceyued by the Holy Ghost in the fleshe: but that wee should vnderstand that to be true baptisme, in which the Holy ghost is giuen.
                  Saint Bede, (who for his great vertue and rare learning was surnamed Venerablis, Venerable or Reuerend,) hath 
                        Beda in Luc cap. 3. these expresse words; Baptizatus est Dominus, non ipse aquis mundari, sed ipsas mundare cupiens aquas, quae ablutae per carnem eius peccati vtique nesciam, Baptismi ius iuduerent, & quod tam innumera sub lege baptismata non poterant, contra prauaricationis malum vim regeneratiua sanctificationis coni ciperent.
                  
                  Our Lord was baptized, not for desire to cleanse himselfe, but to cleanse the waters, that they being washed by his flesh which knewe no sinne, might put vpon them the right of baptisme, and receiue the power of regeneratiue sanctification against the euill of preuarication, which all the washings vnder the Law could not performe. Thus write the holie Fathers. For the better vnderstanding of whose words, three things must be seriously obserued, touching the sanctification they speak of; viz. The time, the manner, and the ende. The time when they were sanctified, the manner how they were sanctified, and the end for which they were sanctified.
                  Concerning the time, wee must knowe, that Christ instituted holie Baptisme two wayes. First, exemplarilie by fact; then expressely by word. Examplarilie, when hee was baptized in Iordan, about three yeeres & a halfe afore his Passion, at what time hee was about 30. yeeres of age. 
                        Matt. 3. 13. Expressely, after his Resurrection, about thirtie dayes before his Ascention vp into Heauen. At which time Christ gaue commission to his Apostles, that they should teache 
                        Mat. 28. 19 and baptize all Nations.
                  Concerning the manner, hee did not instill any inherent sanctimonie or holinesse into the waters, but onely



did consecrate and depute them vnto an holie ende; viz. To be the fit and ordinarie matter of holy baptisme; like as God is saide to haue sanctified and blessed the seuenth 
                        Gen. 2. 3. Exod. 20. 11. day, not by putting any holy inherent qualitie into it, but by deputing and ordeyning it to his owne seruice and holy worshippe. Now, that he ordained exemplarilie both the water of Iordan, and all others, to bee the vsuall matter of the Sacrament of Baptisme; it may appeare by manie circumstances of the Text, aswell for the matter of Baptisme, as for the forme and effect thereof. First, hee determined water to be the matter of baptisme, when he touched 1. it with his owne most pure & holy flesh, and yeelded to be Baptized therewith. Secondly, hee determined the forme of Baptisme, when in his Baptisme the whole Trinitie 2. appeared sensiblie; for, the voyce of the Father was heard from Heauen; the Sonne was present in our flesh 
                        Mat. 3. v. 13. 16. 17. assumpted; and the Holy Ghost appeered in the shape of a Doue. And (as Saint Hylarie saith,) the effect of Baptisme was declared, for that the Heauens were opened in the celebration thereof.
                  Concerning the ende, Baptisme is affirmed of Christ himselfe, to bee our second byrth. In another place it is 
                        Ioh. 3. 5. Act. 22. v. 17. Tit. 3. 5. Rom 6. 4. Chrysosto. in cap. 3. mat. hom. 12. col. 114. said to washe away our sinnes (Sacramentally.) In another place, it is called the lauer of Regeneration, and Renouation of the Holie Ghost. And in another place, it is made the seale of our iustification by faith, of remission of our sinnes, and sanctification in the Holy Ghost. To this effect wryteth the golden mouthed Doctor Saint Chrysostome, in these golden wordes; Neque ideo solum, sed vt & tu disceres, quontam super te quoque cum Sacro Fonte dilueris, Sanctus Spiritus veniat; iam vero non visibils specie, qua vtique non egemus, cum nobis pro cunctis sola fides sufficiat. Nam signa non credentibus, sed incredulis dantur.
                  
                  Neither did the Doue appeare onely for that end, but that thou also mayst learne, that the Holy Ghost commeth vpon thee, when thou art washed in the holie Font; bu



that appearance is not nowe adayes in any visible shape, whereof wee haue no neede, seeing sole faith sufficeth for all. For signes are not giuen to the faithfull, but to the incredulous persons. These things well pondered: the obiection against the booke of Common prayer, will bee to no purpose: vnlesse perhaps it will bee a caueat for the Author, (which I heartilie wish,) to write and speake more circumspectly in time to come. For I verily am perswaded, that all things contayned in the booke of Common prayer, are agreable to the holy Scriptures, & the practise of the Church in the purest times, and composed with such Iudgement, Pietie, Learning, and Religion: that all the wisedome in the worlde, is not able iustlie to controll the same. In so much, that I wonder, and greatly admire the audacious temeritie of manie: who being of small reading and learning, (and of no iudgment and experience, if they bee compared to those auncient, graue, Godly, wise, and learned fathers, that compiled the booke of common prayer,) dare presume to condemne the same, with theyr bitter invectiues, vntimely censures, and vnchristianlike Anathematizations. True it is, that Saint Hierome saith: Nec sibi blandiantur, si de Scripturarum capitulis videntur 
                     
                        Hier. aduers. Lucifer: tom 3 in sine.

                  Neyther must they slatter themselues, if they seeme in their owne conceits to prooue so much as they say: seeing the Deuill himselfe alleadged Scripture (against our Lord Iesus,) and the Scriptures doe not consist in bare reading, but in true Sense and meaning. Would God this graue aduise giuen by this holy, auncient, and learned Father, might be a president and constant rule in this doleful age, to all nouices, superficiall diuines, and young students in Diuinitie, (who more rashly then Clerklie take vpon them to controll not onelie our most Reuerend Fathers, the graue, wise, and learned Byshops, but euen the whole Synode



assembled in the Conuocation house, yea and the King himselfe) to walke circumspectlie, to liue obedientlie, to think modestlie of their own gifts, & not to esteeme better of themselues and their iudgements then there is cause: but to thinke that a learned Synode can see as farre as they, and would as gladly goe to Heauen as they: and consequently to ponder with themselues seriouslie, that it is a too too malepeart saucinesse for young heads and superficiall Diuines of slender Iudgement, and lesse reading of the holy Fathers, auncient Councells, and Ecclsiasticall hystories; to censure and controll not onely the Godlie setled Lawes of our Christian Kingdome, but euen of the continuall practise of the Churche in all ages. I my selfe am about three score yeares of age; I haue endeuoured by Prayer and painefull Studie to attayne good literature, euer since I was fiue yeares of age; I haue liued, conuersed, studied, & disputed in manie famous Vniuersities, aswell in England as in forraine Countries; I haue employed my whole care, industry, and diligence, now for the space of thirty yeares and odde, to vnderstand Gods word aright, & to know what hath bene the practize of Christes church in all former ages: and for that ende and purpose, I haue for the space of thirtie yeares and odde, prouided all the auncient Fathers, Councells, Hystories Ecclesiasticall, and Chronographycall, so far forth as my abilitie was able to extend and reach; and that nothing should be wanting in this behalf, I haue borrowed bookes where I could, and haue also had recourse to the best Libraryes, both in the Vniuersities & els where; to the end I might gather notes out of such bookes, as I was not able to buye and prouide. In which behalfe, not my selfe onely, but all such as reape anie commoditie by my painfull labours, are more then a The L. Bish. of Cant. and the L. Byshop of Dur. haue goodly Libraries. little beholden to these most Reuerend Fathers; Iohn the late Arch-byshoppe of Canterburie, Richard now the L: Arch-byshoppe of Canterburie, and Tobye the L: Bysh. of Durham; who haue for themselues & the good of others,



most excellent, costly, and goodly Libraries: to which I haue found free accesse, at all times when I desired. All this beeing performed I haue verie seriouslie weighed, pondered, and considered, what the Papists, Arrians, Macedonians, Eutichians, Nestorians, Donatists, Carpocratians, Ebionites, Tatians, Manichees, Brownists, and other Sectaries, doe and can say for their opinions; and this notwithstanding, I finde the Doctrine and the Godlie setled Lawes of this Church of England, (amongst which I place the late Canons of Anno. 1604.) to bee consonant to Gods word, & to the vsuall practise of the Church in all former ages. These things I vtter in these tearms, because I heartilie wishe to perswade all such as are carefull of their saluation, to yeeld obedience to higher Powers, and not to bee 
                        Rom. 13. 1. Pet. 2. 1. Sam. 15. v. 22. carryed awaye with the Sugred words of superficiall Diuines, but to learne that obedience is better then Sacrifice. I am now likelie euen by the course of Nature, shortly to forsake this worlde; and therfore I doe not seeke any preferment for my paines, (which I neuer to this daye hunted after,) and much lesse doe I seek to draw men into errrours, and so to make shipwracke of mine owne Soule. No, no, my purpose, (God is my witnesse, is farre otherwise; as who am perswaded so fullie of the Doctrine which I deliuer, that I am not affrayde to ende my life in the same.

                  New-fangled & oddely conceited persons, do scornfullie inueigh against interrogatories ministred at Baptisme; against Godfathers, Godmothers, Fonts, and otherlike Ceremonies, as things vnknowen in the time of the Apostles. To whome I answere in this manner; First, that manie things are this day lawfully done in the Church, which were not in vse in the Apostles time. This is already prooued. 1. Secondly, that the custome of the Church, in things indifferent, is to be esteemed among Christians for a Law, This 2.


                     
is likewise prooued. And let him that holdeth the contrarie opinion, tell mee by what lawe hee can iustifie, that formall coniunction of men and wemen in holy wedlock, which is vsed not onely in our Church of England, but also in purest reformed Churches euerie where. Hee shall neuer bee able to alleadge any ground in that behalfe, but the vnwritten traditions of the Church. Of which traditions th' Apostle spoke, (as learned interpreters tell vs) when 
                        Uide sup. ca. 10. per totū, & ex Calus. cap. 7. he said, he would set other things in order at his comming. Yea M. Caluin vpon that Text admitteth vnwrytten Traditions, in things not necessarie to Saluation. Thirdlie, that Saint Austen, Saint Ambrose, and other auncient Fathers, 1. cor. 11. v. 34. (who liued in the pure ages of the Church,) make mention of Godfathers, and Godmothers, and of the interrogatories    which our Church vseth in the Baptisme of infants. Saint Austen beeing demaunded, howe they that being an infant to baptisme, are bolde to answere that hee beleeueth, and so to all other demaundes, seeing they dare promise nothing of his behauiour when hee commeth to mans state, answereth in these expresse wordes; Si. n. Sacramenta quandam similitudinem earumrerum quarum Sacramenta sunt, non haberent, omnino sacramenta non essent. Ex

                        . For if Sacraments had not a certaine



similitude of those things whereof they bee Sacraments, they were no Sacraments at all. And by reason of this similitude, they are often called by the names of the things themselues. As therefore after a certaine manner of speaking the Sacrament of the bodie of Christ, and the Sacrament of the bloud of Christ, are the bodie and bloud of Christ; so the Sacrament of faith, is faith. Neyther is it any other thing to Beleeue, then to haue Faith. And therefore, when answere is made, that the infant beleeueth, which as yet hath not faith in deed; it is answered, that hee beleeueth, for the Sacrament of faith: and that he doth conuert himselfe to God, for the sacrament of conuersion, because the answere it selfe, perteyneth to the Celebration of the Sacrament. Therefore, although that faith which consisteth in the will of the beleeuers, doth not make the childe faithfull: yet doth the Sacrament of that Faith make him faithfull. For euen as it is answered that hee doth beleeue, so is hee also called faithfull; not by signifying or graunting the thing it selfe in his minde, but by receyuing the sacrament of the thing. Thus writeth S. Austen, that auncient & learned Father, out of whose words I obserue against rash heads, & young Diuines, these most excellent instructions for the humble and Godly readers. First, that this holy & learned father, (whose vertue and learning all .1. the Christian world hath hitherto honored, and admyred.) relyeth & stayeth himself vpon the practise of the Church, which nowe adayes euery proude Brownist, and vnlearned Martinist, contemneth at his pleasure. Secondly, that it was the custome of the Church in S. Aust. time, (which custome he reuerenced,) euen as it is this day, in our Church of England, 2. to propound interrogatories to the suerties, or Godfathers & Godmothers in the behalfe of the childe: as also they did lawfully and truely answere and promise, as the manner is nowe in our Churche, and that their answeres were to bee iustified, by vertue of the Sacrament.
                  
                     
                     The first Obiection.
                     The suerties which you call Godfathers and Godmothers, cannot performe that, which they promise in the name of the child. ergo it is a vaine and rediculous exercise.
                  
                  
                     The Answere.
                     I answere, that the suerties are well able to performe all that they promise, as who promise nothing absolutely, but with a condition vsually vnderstood in all such kinde of promises; viz, if we liue, if Gods will be so, to the vtmost of our power and so forth. And so much may be gathered, out of the expresse words in the booke of common prayer.
                  
                  
                     The second Obiection.
                     Not the infants, but the Godfathers and Godmothers are baptized, and so rebaptization is admitted. For not the child, but they say, I renounce the diuell, that is my desire.
                  
                  
                     The Answere.
                     I answere; first, with the auncient father Areopagita, in Dionisius Areopag. de eccles. hierarchia prope finem. these words, Non. n. hoc ait, ego pro puero abrenuncio, aut promitto, sed puer abrenuntiat & profitetur: id est, profiteor me huic puero suasurum, cum intelligere sacra per aetatem poterit, diuinis meis institutionibus, vt & nuntium remittat adversarijs, atque ab eis deficiat, & profiteatur exolvatque diuina promissa.  
                          Neither doth hee say this, I renounce or promise for the child, but, the childe renounceth and professeth, that is to say, I promise so to instruct the child, when he commeth to yeares of discretion, with my godly instructions and exhortations, he shall renounce all things aduerse, & professe and performe those heauenly promises which he maketh.
                     
                        
Secondly,mwith Saint Austen in these words: Miror sanè quod ita volueris, vt de his quae varie per diversa loca observantur, tibi aliqua conscriberem cum & non sit necessarium, & vna

                        in his saluberrima regula retinenda sit, vt quae non sunt contra fidem, neque contra bonos mores, & habent aliquid ad exhortationem vitae melioris, vbicunque institui videmus, velinstituta cognoscimus, non solum non improbemus, sed etiam laudando & imitando sectemur, si aliquorum infirmit as non ita impedit, vt amplius detrimentum sit.
                     
                     I maruell why you would haue me write to you, touching those things which are diuersely obserued in diuers places, seeing that it is not necessarie, & that in these things we must hold this for a constant and sound rule, that what things soeuer are neither against faith, nor against good manners, and are some helpe to the furtherance of honest life, whersoeuer we see such things to be ordained, we must be so far from reprouing them, that wee must praise & imitate the same; vnlesse some weaklings bee so scandalized, that hurt commeth thereupon.
                     Thirdly, with the zealous and learned Writer maister Zuinglius, in these expresse words, Hic vero singulis videre li

                     Here euery man may see, what subtiltie and craftie dealing contentious Satan vseth, who goeth about by these dissentions in external matters, to make againe a most ready way and passage, for Poperie to enter into our gates.



But in such matters doubtlesse, the Apostles rule must be obserued. Whose vse and administration he saith, is in our arbitrement and power: yet so, that we doe nothing against Gods ordinance, neither haue any desire to trouble the publique peace, whereof we must haue an especial care, for these externall matters. It is therefore this day lawfull for vs also, to institute and ordaine a newe the baptisme of infants, (although it had not hither to bin vsed in the church) if any commoditie, or good successe of peace and concord, might insue thereupon.
                     Out of these learned discourses of these graue and learned Writers, I obserue these memorable rules for the benefit of the gentle Reader. First, that the ceremonies this    day of our English Church, are the same yt were vsed in the church in ye purest times. 2, that in things which are neither    against faith, nor against manners, the custome of the church must be a rule for vs to follow. This is a most worthy lesson, a most excellent rule, and a most necessarie obseruation. Thirdly, that the dissentions and schismes stirred vp about externall rites and ceremonies, proceede from    the crastie and deceitful dealing of the diuel. Fourthly, that the Church hath power to make and constitute any lawes,    which are not repugnant and contrarie to the word of God. Fiftly, that our Church hath this day power to haue instituted    the Baptisme of Infants, although it had not beene vsed in former ages. And consequently, that it hath power a fortiori, to set downe orders and lawes for the apparell of Ministers, for surplesles, square Caps, interrogatories in baptisme, and bowing of the knee at the name of Iesus, for kneeling at the holy Communion, for giuing thanks of women for their deliuerance from the perill of child-birth, for prohibiting to Preach without licence, for Reading of Homilies, and the like. Which rules and obseruations, if they were wel remembred, and duly obserued, all schismes,

                  The third member of Deacons, and their office in the Church.
                  In the booke of orders, there is an office called the Deacon whose description is not to be found in Gods booke. namely consisting in helping the Priest in diuine seruice, especially when he ministreth the holy Communion, in reading holy Scriptures & Homilies in the congregation, instructing the youth in the Catechisme, in Baptizing and Preaching, if he be admitted thereunto by the Bishoppe. Thus Write the patrons of the Eldership, and earnestly wished Presbiterie, to whom I answere in this manner. First, that if it were true which they say, (as it is not indeed;) yet would it not followe, that the office of a Deacon this    day vsuall in the Church, should be a thing vnlawfull to be vsed. The reason is euident, because (as I haue already proued,) the Church hath authoritie to constitute, make, and ordaine, any lawes ceremonies, canons, ordinances, and orders, 
                        Vide supra, Cap. 5. which are for the good of the Church, and not against the word of God. for the better confirmation whereof, let vs heare the verdict of maister Zanchius, that most famous Writer. These are his expresse words: interea tamen non improbamus patres, quod iuxta variātū verbi dispensandi, tum regendae 
                     
                        Zanchius de relig. Pag. 169. 
                     Ecclesiae rationem, varios quoque ordines ministrorū multiplicarint, quando id eis liberum fint, sicut & nobis, & quando constat, id ab illis fuisse factum honestis de causis, ad ordinē ad decorū & ad aedificationē ecclesiae pro eo tempore pertinentibus.
                  
                  Neuerthelesse, we doe not discommend or reproue the adde huc membrum precedens fathers, because they did multiply and increase the orders of the ministers, according to the various manner of dispensing the word, and of gouerning the Church. Seeing that was in their libertie and power, as it is also in ours; And seeing also it is euident, that they did that for honest causes, for order, comlinesse, and edification of the Church, as that time did require. Out of these golden



wordes, I obserue first, that the holy fathers in former ages    did institute diuers orders of Ministers: which orders though they be not found expressely in Gods booke, yet this great learned man dareth not disalowe or reproue the same. But our young maisters, (who for learning are vnworthy to carrie his bookes after him) dare condemne them roundly, and make hauocke of the Lawes of the ancient Church. Secondly, that the Church both then    and now, had and still hath full power and authoritie, to constitute diuers orders of Ministers in the Church. Let this obseruation bee well marked; for it is of great importance, and no small moment. Thirdly, that such orders    and constitutions, doe pertaine to the order, comelinesse, and edification of the Church. Fourthly, that these things may be changed at the discretion of the Church, as the circumstances    
                     Nota membrum praecedens valde. of the times, places, and persons doe require.
                  I answere secondly, that the office of Deacons is no otherwise this day in our English Churches, then it was of    old in all Churches throughout the Christian world. I 
                        Conc. Nicen. can. 14. Conc. Carth. 4. Can. 37. Iustin. Apol. 2. in fine.
                      proue it, for that both ancient councells, of Nice, Carthage, and others, and also the holy fathers, doe testifie the same so copiously, as none but younglings of no reading, can be ignorant thereof.
                  Thirdly, that Deacons in the Apostolique time and primitiue Church, did not onely serue the table, and minister    to the poore, but also baptize and preach the Gospell. I prooue it first, because there were Deacons at Ephesus, at Philippi, and in Crete; as may euidently be gathered of the Epistles, which were written to Timothie, Titus, and the 
                        ratio. 1. 
                     Philippians. And for al that, there was in those places at that time such paucitie of Christians, as there could bee either small neede or none at all, for Deacons to attend vpon the tables. Secondly, because the solemnitie of imposition of hands, vsed in the ordering and consecration of Deacons,    doth argue a further and more excellent function,



then the bare and sole ministerie of the table. This was well obserued by the great learned Doctor Illyricus, whose 
                        Illyricus, in 1. Tim. 3. 9. wordes are these; Hinc autem apparet eos non tantum ad dispensationem elemosynarum alimentorumque, sed etiam ad institutionem auditorum fuisse adhibitos, sicut & illi Act. 6. etiam simul docuerunt, non tantum aeconomiam administrarunt; sed nimirum munus illorum fuit tantum rudiores instituere, seu catechismum tradere, dum presbyteri omnibus sufficere laboribus nequeunt. Hence it is apparant, that the Deacons were ordained, not onely to distribute almes and reliefe to the poore, but also to instruct and teach their auditors, as they also, of whom mention is made in the acts, were occupied in teaching, and not onely in houshold-businesse. For their office was to instruct the ignorant, and to Catechise, while the pastorall Elders could not vndergoe all the labours. Loe, Illyricus (who vnderstood the Scriptures, as well as our Brownists and Martinists,) affirmeth plainely and constantly, that the office of Deacons, euen in the Apostles time, was not onely to attend on the poore, but also to instruct and Preach the Gospell.
                  I proue it Thirdly, because Philippe the Deacon did not onely attend the poore, but was also occupied in Baptizing    and in Preaching. As also, for that Saint Steuen another Deacon, made a long, learned, and most godly Sermon, vnto the obstinate and stiffe-necked Iewes; in which he proued at large, that he did serue and worship the euerliuing 
                        Act. 8. v. 35. 38. Act. 7. Vsque. v. 53. God aright, euen that God who chose the fathers afore Moses was borne, and before their Temple was built.
                  
                     The first Obiection.
                     
                        Steuen the Deacon did not preach at all, but onely defended himselfe in a long Oration, against the wicked and slaunderous accusations of the stiffe-necked Iewes, which to doe is lawfull, not for Deacons onely, but also for all other Christians.
                  
                  
                     
                     The Answere.
                     I answere first, that Saint Steuen answered in the way    of Preaching for edification sake, not in the way of pleading for his owne defence, albeit one may answere accusations in a Sermon. For first, hee sharpely reprooued 
                           Cap. 7. 51. Cap 6. 9. them, terming them stiffe necked, and of vncircumcised hearts and eares. Secondly, hee was in the sinagogue of    the Libertines. Thirdly, the end and scope of his speech,    was to proue the true and pure worship of God, neither to be affixed to the Temple, nor to any externall ceremonies. All which being put together, it is cleere that Saint Steuen made a godly Sermon. This my answere is confirmed by 
                           Illyricus in 6. cap. act. v. 8. the verdict of Illyricus, whose words are these, Videtur autem hic Stephanus egressus esse metas suae vocationis, qui magis apostoli, quam diaconi munus vsurpaverit, docendo, disputando, & miracula edendo. Sed sic deus solet suam quandam viam libere ingredi spirando suo spiritu vbi vult.
                     
                     
                        Steuen seemes here to haue passed the limits of his calling, in vsing the function rather of an Apostle, then of a Deacon, teaching, disputing, and working miracles, But thus God will vse his owne waies, breathing with his spirit where he listeth.
                     Againe in another place, the same Illyricus hath these words: primum, est longa concto Stephani, vsque ad 53. Versum.

Gualterus doth both of them affirme constantly, that Saint Steuen vsed to preach vsualy. I answere secondly, that if it be true, (which the obiection thereof supposeth,) that an Apologie cannot consist with a true and godly Sermon: then will it follow of necessitie, that Saint Paule did not Preach before Foelix the gouernour of Iurie, which to

when hee answered to those that accused the Apostles of Drunkennesse, before the Iewes, and all the strangers that 
                           Act. 2. v. 15. did inhabite Ierusalem.
                     
                     I answere thirdly, that the custome of the church is of 3. great authority, for the true sense & meaning of the doubtfull texts of Scripture. By which custome it is euident, that Deacons did Baptize and preache in the primitiue church: and that both Steuen and Philip did the same, although they were but Deacons, Saint Hierome hath these words, 
                           Hieron. adu. Lucifer. tom. 3. fol. 3. c.

                     I doe not denie, that this is the custome of the church, that the Byshop should goe to those, which in Villages a farre of were baptized by the Priests and Deacons, and lay his hands vpon them with inuocation of the Holie Ghost. Loe, the custome of the church approoued the baptisme of Deacons, which shall bee made more apparant, in answere to the next obiection.
                  
                  
                     The second Obiection.
                     
                        Philip that baptized the Eunuch, was Philip th' Apostle, 
                           Act. 8. v. 35 38. not Philip the Deacon: Besides, hee was then an Euangelist, and so baptized & preached as an Euangelist, and not by vertue of his Deaconshippe.
                  
                  
                     The answere.
                     I answere: first, that this Philip, (wherof the controuersie    it made) was not an Apostle, but one of the seaue Deacons. 
                           Act. 8. v. 1. 14. Act. 8. v. 1. The reason hereof is euident, because all th' Apostles (as S. Luke writeth,) remained 
                           〈◊〉
                         at Ierusalem and consequently it must needes bee Philip the Deacon, who was dispersed with the rest, and came to 
                           
                              〈◊〉
                           , where hee now preached



and baptized. The words of the text are these, they were all scattered abroad through the Regions of Iudaea, and Samaria, except th' Apostles. Againe; then came Philippe, 
                        
                           Act. 8 v. 5. Act. 
                           
                              •
                           . 14. into the Citie of Samaria, and preached Christ vnto them. Againe thus; Nowe, when the Apostles which were at Ierusalem, heard say that Samaria had receyued the worde of God, they sent vnto them Peter and Iohn. By these seuerall Texts, it is most apparant to all indifferent readers, that Philippe which baptized the Aethiopian, was none of the Apostles; but was that Deacon which came into Samaria, Philippe th' Apostle being still at Ierusalem. But the Patrons of the Eldershippe, vse to shuffle vppe Scriptures, they care not how, so they may seeme to conclude their intent and purpose. Let vs heare what Maister Caluin saith, 
                           Calui. in. 21. Act. v. 7. 8. whose words are these; Caesareae vsos fuisse dicit hospitio Philippi, quem Euangelistam vocat, licet vnus esset e septem Diaconis, vt visum est capite sexto. Diaconiam illam fuisse temporale 
                        
                           Uide Bezā. in

                           , hinc conijcere promptum est; quod Philippo alioqui liberumnon fuisset, relicta Ierosolimae Caesaream migrare. He telleth vs, that they lodged with Philippe at Caesarea, whome he calleth Euangelist, although hee were indeed one of the seuen Deacons. Hence wee may gather, that his Deaconshippe was but a temporarie office; for otherwise he could not haue left Ierusalem, and haue gone to Caesarea. Where I must needs wish the Reader to obserue by the way, that seeing the office of Deacons was temporarie and mutable; much more may the same bee saide of vnpriested Elders, if anic such were in any age, place, or time.
                     I answere secondly, that Philip which baptized the Aethiopian Eunuch, was not onely once a Deacon, but still remained    so: and that he was called an Euangelist, because he did Euangelize, and preach the Gospell, In which sense e
                           ••
                        ry preacher may thus be truelie called an Euangelist, as both M. Bullinger, & other learned writers graunt. This to be so, the verie expresse words of the text doe prooue it so plainly, that no denyall can be made therof. Thus writeth



Saint Luke, Eiselthontes eis ton 
                              •
                           icon Philippou tou Euangelistou ontos

                        ec ton hepta emeinamen par auto. Entring into the house of Philip th' Euangelist, being one of the seauen, wee aboade with him. Loe, S. Luke speaketh not in the preterperfect tense, or preterplusperfect tense, who hath or had bene one of the seauē Deacons; but he saith in the present tense, who is euen now one of the seauen; For so the Originall Greeke word (ontos), must needs be expressed, seing it is a participle of the present time, or time euen now beeing. And the holy Fathers together with the practise of the church, haue euer so vnderstood this text of Scripture.
                     Saint Epiphanius deliuereth his minde in these plaine 
                           Epipha. li. 1. to. 2. haeres. 21. pag. 18. tearmes; Omnes verò praeter ipsum susceperunt magnorum A. postolorum praesentians, & per impositionem manuum ipsorum acceperunt Spiritum sanctum. Nam quum Philippus Diaconus esset, non habebat potestatem imponendi manus, vt per hoc daret Spiritum sanctum.
                     
                     They all, hee onely excepted, receyued the presence of the mightie Apostles, and by imposition of their hands, they enioyed the holy Ghost. For Philip being a Deacon onelie, had not power to impose hands, thereby to giue the holy Ghost.
                     S. Austen hath these expresse words; Iterum, multum distare inter Diaconum & sacerdotem liber approbat, quē dicimus 
                        
                           August. in quaest.

                           t darent spiritum sanctum, per manus impositionem. Again, the booke which wee call the Acts of the Apostles, prooueth that a Deacon differeth much from a Priest. For when they of Samaria had beleeued the preaching of Philip the Deacon, ordeined of th' Apostles; they sent (saith the booke) Peter and Iohn vnto them, that they might giue the holy Ghost, by imposition of hands, to those that did beleeue. Thus wee see the iudgement of S. Epiphanius and S. Austen, who both iointly affirme Philip to haue bene but a Deacon, and



yet to haue baptized and preached. Yea Maister Gualter, Maister Aretius, and the Magaeburgenses, doe all constanthe

Magdeb. cent. 1. lib. 2. ca. 7. p. 508. and vniformely contest the same truth, with the auncient Fathers and continuall custome of the Church in all ages. They write plainely, that although Deacons were chieflie occupied about the dispensation of the churches goods! yet did they employe their labours so far forth as they might, in the other ministeries of the church.
                  
               
               
                  The fourth member of Deacons promoted to Priesthood.
                  The Church of England is charged to doe against the word of God, while shee vseth to make one and the same person, first a Deacon, and afterward a Priest. To which calumnie, I answere in briefe in this manner. First, that it is not against the word of God, but very consonant and altogether 1. agreable to the same. For no Scripture can bee alleadged, to prooue that a Deacon maye not become a Priest. Maister Caluin affirmeth constantly, that Philippe was first a Deacon, and afterward an Euangelist, Priest, or 
                        Caluian cap. 21. Act.
                      pastorall elder. Secondly, that the church of England vsing the Deaconshippe, as a steppe or degree vnto Priesthood, 2. doth nothing against the iudgement of the auncient Fathers, but followeth the vsuall practise of the church in all ages. The reason hereof is, and euer was this; viz. that there might be some time of try all, of their behauiour in the Deaconshippe, before they were or could bee admitted to the order of Priesthood. No Councell, no Father, no hystorie Ecclesiasticall, no time, no place, no person, since the Apostolike age, can be named to the contrary. To the continuall practise of the Church from age to age, th' Apostles words may sitly be applied, when he saith: the deacons that 1. Ion. 3. v. 13 haue ministred well, get themselues a good degree. For sun 
                        〈…〉
                      writer; of high esteem in the church, do 
                        〈…〉
                      the word (Degree) a steppe vnto the 
                        〈…〉
                      or Priesthood. This notwithstanding,



it is not of necessitie, that euery Deacon become a Priest, by any canon or constitution of the church. For his behauiour in the Deaconship may be such, that the church will deeme him vnmeete to be preferred vnto Priesthood. And therefore I conclude with these words of S. Hierome, Et si scripturae 
                     
                        Hieron. adv. Lucif. tom. 3. fol. 63 c.

                  Although they were no authoritie in Holy Scripture; yet should the consent of all the Christian worlde, haue the force and strength of a law in this behalfe. For many other

                      things, which the church obserueth by tradition, are become equiualent to the written law. Loe, S. Hierome affirmeth boldly & constantly, as do also S. Augustine. M. Caluin, and others, (as I haue already prooued,) that the custome & tradition of the church must bee in steede of a lawe vnto Christians. Which euer is to be vnderstood, in things not repugnant to the word of God, (or as M. Caluin. speaketh)

                  The fyfth member, of the generall confession made by priuate persons in the Church.
                  The Patrons of the expected Eldership or Presbyterie, exclame against the booke of common prayer; because it giueth libertie to the Laycall communicants, to make a generall confession of their sinnes, before the congregation then present; as if therby the Laicall communicants, should presently become publique ministers of the church. To these men I answere in this manner; first, that they seeme to    thēselues to be the onely wise men in the worlde, & to condemne all the rest of follie: For otherwise, they would not so roundly & peremptorily take vpon themselues, and that without either Scripture, Councell, or Father; nay, without all time or reason, to controll & condemne the book of publique praier, (which I verily think to haue bene composed by the assistance of the Holy Ghost;) & consequently,



to condemne all the ancient Byshops, (those glorious martyrs of our Lord Iesus,) the most famous Byshop of Sarisburie, (the Iewell of England in his time) the Byshops that now liue, (who are both wise, vertuous, & learned,) & all the residue of the learned Cleargie of this our English Church. Secondly, that by their grosse assertion, ioyned with a most    vnchristian reprehension, the lowly Publican highly commended 
                        Luke. 18. v. 13. in the Gospell, should bee made a Minister of the Church, or haue intruded him himself into the function of publique Ministerie, when hee knocked vppon his breast, & said; O God be mercifull to me a sinner. Thirdly, that by    the same reason, the notorious sinners which were put to open penance in the primitiue Church, and confessed their faults before the congregation. should bee in the same predicament. Fourthlie, that publique penitents this daye,    (who are for all that approoued of the Patrons of the Presbyterie,) should be caught in the same nette. Fyftlie, that the same may bee saide of Women, singing Psalmes in the Church, and that with more probabilitie; who for all that are approoued in so doing, not onely in this Church of England, 
                     
                        Augustin, ad Ianuarim epist. 118. but also in all other reformed churches wheresoeuer. I therefore conclude this member, with this Golden sentence of S. Austen; if any thing be obserued vniuersallie of the whole church; then not to obserue that, or to call it into question, is meere madnesse, and desperate follie.
               
               
                  The sixt member, of praying to be deliuered, from Lightning, Plague, and sodaine death.
                  It is scornefully obiected against the prayers of the church, that when wee pray to bee deliuered from plague, famine, and from other aduersitie, wee pray without faith, because wee haue no promise to receiue the things we pray 1. for. To whom I answere; First, that our Sauiour Christ taught vs so to pray, when hee deliuered to his Church the forme of that prayer, which we should daily vse; Being the



most exact, and most perfect prayer, that euer was, or can 
                        Mat. 6. v. 13. be made. Where the Notes of the Geneua Byble expound it, to be deliuered from all aduersitie: And consequently,    that we pray with saith, seeing Holy writ is our warrant for 1. Ioh. 5. 14. Luke. 11. 9. Mat. 7. 7. Ioh. 16. 24. Apoe. 3. v. 20. that we pray. Secondly, that wee haue promise to receiue that wee pray for, so far forth as standeth with Gods glorie and our soules health. For Christ himselfe willeth vs to aske, and wee shall receiue; to seeke, and wee shall finde; to knocke, and it shall be opened vnto vs. Yea, he standeth knocking at the doore of our hearts, and if wee will open the do
                        •
                     e to him, hee will enter into the house of our hearts, and dwell with vs, and giue vs all things necessarie, both for our bodies, and for our soules. And to assure vs thereof, Christ willeth vs to beleeue that wee shall haue our 
                        Mar. 11. v. 24. request, it shall bee done vnto vs. And if any will replie, that many aske many things in prayer, and yet doe not attaine the same: to such I answere with Saint Iames, in these 
                        Iac. 4. 3. words; yee aske, and receyue not, because yee aske amisse, that ye may lay the same out on your pleasures. Thirdly,    that when our church prayeth to bee deliuered from all aduersitie, 
                        In Dom. Trioration. Gen. 22. v. 11. she hath both the example and aduise of most holy men. The holy Patriarch Iacob, fearing to receyue some bodily harme and aduersitie of his brother, prayed to God in this manner; (O God) I pray thee deliuer mee from the hand of my brother from the hand of Esau; for I feare him, least hee will come and sinite mee, & the mother vpon the children King Dauid, fearing to receyue bodilie harme of his sonne Absalon, fled away from him, and prayed God to turne the counsell of Achitophel (who conspired with Absalon) into foolishnes. The whole congregation prayed to 2. Sam. 15. v. 31 psa. 20. God, to prosper their King, when hee went forth to battell against the Ammonites. And I deeme them no good subiects, to our most gracious Soueraigne King Iames, who will not pray to God vnfaynedlie, to defende him from all aduersitie; Neyther yet those persons who refuse



to pray with our church; for all happinesse aswell corporall & temporarie, as spirituall & Eternall, to our most vertuous Queene Anne, the noble Prince Henry, & all the rest 
                        Mat. 24. v. 02. of that most Royall progenie. Yea, Christ himselfe forewarning his disciples, of externall future aduersity, willeth them to pray to bee defended from the same. Praye saith Christ, that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the Sabboth day. And besides the sixt petition of the Lords prayer (which teacheth vs to pray) to be defended from all aduersitie, (as S. Cyprian, Ursinus, and Illyricus with manie other learned wryters expound it,) and besides the fourth 
                        Cyprian. in orat. dom. pag. 313. petition also, which teacheth vs to pray for all things needfull for this life, (as the same wryters tell vs,) many examples of the new Testament doe make it cleere and euident, 
                        Vrsin. par. 4. pag. 422. that Christ was well pleased with their prayers, who prayed for things to this life appertaining. The Ruler prayed for the life of his Daughter, & Christ performed his desire. 
                        Mat. 9. 22. Mur. 10. v. 51 52. Mat. 9. 30. Mat. 15. v. 22. 28. 
                     Bartimaeus the sonne of Tymans desired to receiue his sight, & obtained his request. Two blind men followed Christ, and requested to receiue their sight, & hee yeelded to their petitions. A woman a Canaanite desired Christ to helpe her Daughter, who was miserablie vexed with a Deuill, & Christ cured her daughter presently. Many other like exā
                     ples I might alledge; but in steed therof, this onelie goldē sentence of S. Augustine shall suffice. Cum dicimus, libera nos a malo, nos admonemus cogitare nondum nos esse in eo bono, vbi 
                     
                        August. epist. 121. pa. 403. 
                     nullum patiemur malum. Et hoc quidem vltimum, quod in Dominica oratione positum est, tam late, tamque enidenter, & manifestè patet, vt homo Christianus in qualibet tribulatione constitutus, in hoc gemitus edat, in hoc lachrymas fundat, hinc exordiatur, in hoc immoretur, ad hoc terminet orationem.
                  
                  When wee say, Deliuer vs from euill, wee admonish ourselues to consider with our selues, that we are not as yet in that good estate, where wee shall suffer no euill. And this which is last placed in the Lords Prayer, is extended



so farre, and so plainly, that a Christian man moued with any kind of tribulatiō may in this petition sigh, in this shed his teares, begin herein, continue herein, and end his prayer herein. Thus writeth this holy father. And now, where it is wont to be obiected against the custome of our Church, that we know not that God wil deliuer vs from all such aduersitie: as from lightning, thunder, fire, water, sodaine death, and such like. I answere that we are not to command God, or to appoint him an houre, but to expect his good time, and to referre euery part and parcell of our petitions, to his holy will and pleasure euer implied in all our prayers. And againe, that if we must pray for nothing, but that onely which wee knowe God will grant, we shall seldome or neuer pray for any thing at all. No, wee must not say to our neighbour ryding towards London, God speede you well: nor to the sicke persons, GOD helpe you, nor for the preseruation of his Maiestie, GOD saue the King. How absurde these things are, euery childe can discerne: and yet the patrons of the Presbyterie condemne our Church, for Preaching to be defended from all aduersitie, vpon such sillie fansies and slender groundes.

                  It is thought a very haynous offence, that the Church doth sometime require an oath, whereby certaine persons are constrained to accuse themselues. Which oath, because some doe offer it by vertue of their place and charge committed to them, is by some male-contents ironically termed the oath ex officio. But I answere: first, that    it is as vsually ministred in the Ciuill affaires of the common-weale, as in the Ecclesiasticall causes of the Church, whereof none can bee ignorant, that haue any notice of the ordinarie practise, of his Maiesties



honourable Counsell in the North of England. Which vsage though of great antiquitie, hath for all that euer beene approued and deemed lawfull, as well by the wisest and best learned of the church, as also of the commonweale of England, vntill these last and worst dayes, in which some fewe young Doctors of small reading, haue audaciously taken vpon them, to censure both our church and Kingdome in that behalfe. 2. that it is noe small sinne    for the inferiour to disobey the Lawe of his superiour in indifferent things (of which sort and order is euery oath clad with circumstances to this case appertaining,) as it may euidently be prooued, by the testimonie of the best both olde and moderne Writers. It were enough for tryall hereof, to call to minde what is alreadie Written. But for better satisfaction of the friendly Reader, I am content to alledge their testimonies, whose iudgements the male-contents themselues will easily admit. Maister Beza hath these expresse wordes; Res alioqui per se mediae

                  Things otherwise of themselues indifferent, doe after a sort change their nature, so soone as by any lawfull precept, they are either commaunded or prohibited, because they neither can be omitted against a iust mandate, if they be commaunded: neither yet be done against an interdict,



when they are forbidden. For albeit God alone doth properly bind the conscience, yet for all that, when the Magistrate Behold order and comlines doe edifie. Let this be well marked. being Gods minister, iudgeth it expedient for the publique weale, that a thing otherwise of it selfe lawfull, be not done, or the Church hauing respect to order and comlinesse, and consequently to edification, ordaineth lawes touching things indifferent, then such Lawes must be altogether obserued of the godly, and they so farre bind the consciences, that no man can wittingly and willingly with a rebellious minde, either doe the things so forbidden, or omit the things so cōmanded, but he shall thereby become guiltie of sinne.
                  Maister Martyr hath these wordes; Quare hand nos latere

                     oportet &c. Wherefore we must not be ignorant, that in the church there be three vertues of traditions. Some of them are euidently deduced and gathered out of the Scriptures. And touching this kinde, all the faithful are bound to communicate together. Other some are wholy repugnant to the word of God, & they must be reiected, by what authoritie so euer they be obtruded. And there be a third sort of traditions, which we may call neutrall or indifferent; because they are neither contrary to Gods word, nor yet necessarily ioyned thereunto. In which last kind we must obey the church, three cautions being obserued. First, that they be not obtruded as a part of Gods worship, or peculiar holinesse, but as pertaining to order, & the ciuill commoditie of the church, & to comlinesse in diuine actions: for all things are contained sufficiently in the holy Scriptures, which pertaine to Gods worship and holinesse. Secondly, that they be not reputed so necessarie, but that they may be changed, if time so require. Let the church keepe her interest in these indifferent things, to appoint what shall bee thought most necessarie and meete to edifie the faithfull. Last of all, let not Gods people be burdened with too great a multitude of them. Thus writeth this learned man.

                  The Churches in Svevia: in their confession haue 
                        Confess. Svevica. Pag. 230. these wordes; Tales multas sanè ecclesia hodie iure obseruat, & pro occasione quoque condit novas, quas qui reiecerit, is non hominum, sed dei (cuius traditio est, quaecunqus vtilis est,) auctoritatem contemnit. Many such traditions the Church this day obserueth aright, and as occasion requireth, she appointeth and maketh new ones, which new orders whosoeuer shal reiect, he contemneth the authoritie not of men, but of God.
                  Out of these testimonies, of these famous, godly, zealous, and most learned writers, I obserue these golden lessons. First, that things of their own nature indifferent, doe    after a sort change their nature, so soone as they be cōmanded to be done, or left undone, by the setled lawes of the Church. Secondly, that they bind the consciences of all persons,    subiect to the Churches iurisdiction, so far and in such sort, that they cānot at any time, or in any place transgresse the same without great sinne, if such transgression be ioyned and annexed, either to scandall or contempt. Thirdly, that whosoeuer reiecteth such lawes and ordinances of the    Church, contemneth the authoritie of God, & not of men. Fourthly, that he sinneth grieuously, who either doth the    things which the Church prohibiteth, or omitteth the things which she commandeth to be done, so long as her commandements remaine within the limits of things indifferent, which she appointeth for order, decencie and the common good of the Church.
                  I answere thirdly, that the Church hath authoritie to Tertio Principa
                           ••
                        ter. impose euery lawfull ordinance and constitution, which she deemeth profitable for the Church, vpon euery person



subiect to her iurisdiction. This point is sufficiently proued alreadie, both in this present Chapter, and in many others throughout this discourse. So that henceforth, one onely thing remaineth for me to proue; viz. That to minister the oath ex officio, whereby one is bound to accuse himselfe is either a thing lawfull of it selfe, or else Adiaphoron and a thing indifferent of it owne nature. I attempt the proofe. Euery thing is either good of it selfe, as God the author and giuer of all goodnesse, or euill of it selfe, as the blaspheming of God; or indifferent of it owne nature, as golde, money, oyle, wine, and such like. Now if the oath ex officio be good in it selfe, then doubtlesse, the Church may minister it to her subiects with out offence. None that hath sence or reason, will or can for shame denie the same. Againe, if it be Adiaphoron, a thing of it owne nature indifferent, then it is likewise in the power and libertie of the Church, to impose the same vppon euery member within her iurisdiction.
                  This is so sufficiently proued, as no deniall can bee made thereof. It is therefore either euill of it owne nature, or else doubtlesse it may not bee withstoode or gainesaide, that it is not ill of it owne nature, I thus proue it, and I wish the reader to marke well my wordes. If it bee euill, it is either euill simply and absolutely considered, as it is an oath: or else, as it is ministred to such a person. Not the former, because euerie magistrat may lawfully minister an oath, so often as due order of iustice doth require.
                  For as the Apostle saith, an oath for confirmation, is among men an ende of all strife. Yea, Gods name is confessed by true and lawfull oaths. For as holy Moses 
                     
                        Hebr. 6. Vers. 16. saieth, thou shall feare the Lord thy GOD, and serue him, and shall sweare by his name. And the Prophet Ioremiah telleth vs, that it is euer lawfull to 
                        Deut. 6. Vers. 13.


                     
sweare for the aduancement of GODS glorie, and the profit of others, so these three conditions, iustice, 
                        Iere. 4 v. 2 iudgement, and truth, bee alwaies annexed vnto it viz. if wee sweare truly, reuerently, and iustly. Not the latter.
                  First. for that it may be, and often is ministred to many    without offence, as the aduersaries of the same oath cannot but confesse. But if it were euill of it owne nature, it could neuer be lawfully done.
                  Secondly, for that it is no sinne at all, for a sinner to accuse himselfe of the sinne he hath committed. But it is a singular    vertue to confesse our faults and offences, and the ready way to obtaine fauour at Gods hands. This knew holy Iosua right well, when speaking by the spirit of God hee 1. Ioh. 1. v. 9. willed Achan to acknowledge his sinne. My sonne saith he, I beseech ye giue glorie to the Lord God of Israel, & make 
                        Ios. 7. 19. confession vnto him, shewe mee now what thou hast done, hide it not from me. Loe, to confesse our secret sinnes to Gods minister, is to glorifie God and to honour his holy name. And therefore saith the note of the Geneua Bible, that God is glorified, when the truth is confessed. This knew Saint Mathew right well, when writing the Gospell of Iesus Christ, and reckoning vp the names of the Apostles, 
                        Mat. 10. Vers. 3. hee termeth himselfe Mathew the Publicane. This knew S. Paul right well, when he left it written to all posterities, that hee had bin a blasphemer, a persecuter, and an oppresser. This Saint Austen, Saint Hierome, and many 1. Tim. 1. Uers. 13. other holy men knewe right well, when they inrolled their peculiar sinnes in their owne bookes, which they divulged to the view of the whole world.
                  Thirdly, because the rule of charitie doth teach the same. How proue I that? forsooth, because our aduersaries herein    will not refuse to accuse ours neighbours by testifying the truth against them, when occasion so requireth euen vpon their oathes. And consequently, seeing the true loue of our 
                        Mat. 22. Vers. 39. selues is that rule, by which our loue towards our neighbor



must be squared, it followeth of necessitie, that it is as lawfull for vs to accuse and testifie against our selues, as it is to accuse and testifie against our neighbour. This reason can neuer be answered. And it will not serue to reply, that it is a cruell part to cause a man to accuse himselfe. For First,    there is no more crueltie in ministring the oath, whereby the malefactor accuseth himselfe, then there is in giuing sentence, against a felon or a traitor to suffer death. The reason is euident, because the Iudge be haueth himself alike in both cases. viz. He in both cases pla
                        •
                     eth the part of Gods annointed and lawfull minister. Secondly, it cōmeth not of the nature    of the oath but, per accidens that the partie sworne doth accuse himselfe. For, if he were innocent, as he is nocent; he could not be accused, by vertue of the oath. For, the oath is as free to commend him, as to condemne him, and as indifferent to acquit him, as to accuse him. If it were otherwise, all that take the oath, shold be accused by vertue therof. Which how false it is, all the Christiā world can witnes. Thirdly, it is a vertue iustly to punish him, who vniustly    hath done iniurie to others. Fourthly, it is a great sinne in a    magistrate, to omit that punishment which iustly may be inflicted, to the harme & great daunger either of the whole    Church, or of many godly members in the same. Fiftly, the 
                        Mat. 5. Uers. 24. oath doth onely induce iurantem to that by way of iustice, which hee is bound to doe by Gods law of his own accord    
                     viz. to confesse the iniurie hee hath done, and to be recociled 
                        Rom. 13. to his brother. Lastly, he sinneth grieuously, whosō
                     euer 
                        Uers. 2. 5. 1. Pet. 2. 13. refuseth to confesse the truth, when his competent and lawful Iudge demandeth it iuridically at his handes. I therefore conclude that albeit the competent iudge cannot lawfully and iuridically exact an oath, for the manifestation of sinnes secret and altogether vnknowne, (because such secret sinnes are reserued onely and solely to the indgement of GOD,) yet when there goeth a common fame, or when there is a vehement suspition, or semiplena probatio (as the Canons terme it,) of such a fact committed by such a Person: then the Iudge



may lawfully by iuridicall processe, exact a corporall oath of euery suspected person. In which case onely (as I conceiue it,) the oath ex officio is ministred, and in no other. In regard whereof, I would wish all inferiours to be more obedient and circumspect in future times, and not to be carried away head-long with audacious temeritie, peremptorily to censure and condemne the Lawes of their superiours, the true nature wherof, many of them doe little vnderstand. Let them remember, what the wise man saith, be not iust ouermuch, neither make thy selfe ouerwise. And 
                        Eccles. 7. Uers. 18. Rom. 12. Uers. 3. as Saint Paul aduiseth vs, let no man presume to vnderstand, aboue that which is meete to vnderstand, but that he vnderstand according to sobrietie. Which holy counsell if it were pondered aright, and deepely fixed in all mens hearts, many too too forward young Diuines, would more sparingly censure the lawes of their superiours, and follow 
                        Iac. 1. 19. Saint Iames his precept, in being swift to heare, and slow to speake.
               
            
            
               
                  CHAP. XV. Of the punishing and pardoning of male factors.
               
               
                  THe patrons of the newe English long wished presbyterie, are so sharpe, forward, and rigorous, in the punishing of sin & sinners, that in effect they spoile all magistrates of their lawfull authoritie, & make them guiltie of sinnes moe then a fewe. For they write resolutely (I will not say, audaciously,) that the ciuill magistrates cannot saue the liues of any blasphemers, murderers, adulterers, and such like. Which how vnsound a doctrine it is, I purpose in God to make it manifest, by way of conclusions.
               
                  The first Conclusion.
                  No Christian Magistrate is this day bound to obserue,



either the Ceremoniall, or the Iudiciall Lawe of Moses. I prooue it briefelie. The Lawe of Moses was Tripar
                        •
                     ite: 
                        Uide su. ca. 8. aphoris. 3. in resp. ad 2. obiect.
                      Ceremoniall, Iudiciall, Morall. Of which three, the Morall part onely is this daye in force with Christians. The reason hereof is this; because it is in deede the very lawe of Nature, imprinted in euery mans heart in his Natiuitie, and so cannot be altered. The Iudiciall parte was properlie, and peculiarlie appointed of God, for conseruation of Iustice, among the Iewes, in the land of promise, the land of Canaan, the land of Iewrie. The whole order of which gouernment ceased long fithence: viz. Euer since the people of Israell were expelled out of Iudaea, & began to dwell amongst the Gentiles: liuing without Gouernours, without a King, without a Priest, and without a Lawe. The Ceremoniall part was ordeined, to prefigure Christs future Priesthoode; and therefore was it whollie abrogated, 
                        Ioh. 19. 30. Rom. 10. 4. Luke. 24. Heb. 7. v. 12. by Christs most blessed and Sacred Aduent. For Christ was the ende of the Lawe; in whom were fulfilled as well the figures as the promises contayned in the Lawe, and the Prophets. All which Saint Paul compriseth pithily, in these golden wordes. For, if the Priesthoode bee chaunged, then of necessitie, the Lawe also must bee changed. Yea, Christ himselfe seemed to insinuate no lesse, when hee refused to condemne the adulteresse to death, according to the Iudiciall law of Moses; albeeit the Scribes & Pharisees did euen then vrge him with the constitution of that Law. And S. Austen doth conclude no lesse out of Christs words, if hee be rightly vnderstood. But, for the 
                        Aug ad Poll. de adult. coniugijs, tom. 6. true sense and meaning of S. Austens discourse, his two books written to Pollentin, must be well pondered & aptly matched together. For I stand not so much of Christs freeing the adulteresse, from the punishment of the Iudiciall law of Moses; as of that other ground, vppon which S. Austen stayeth himselfe. viz. That adulterie doth not dissolue the bond of holy Wedlock. For albeeit sundrie late Wryters, otherwise of great learning and rare gifts, doe



constantly teach (which some of our men haue also put in practise) that when the husband is diuorced from his wife, being an adulteresse then hee may lawfullie marrie an other: yet Saint Austen grounding his opinion, vppon the words of Christ, & of S. Paul; concludeth constantly that whosoeuer shall marrie another wife, during the life of his former wife diuorced for adulterie, doth himselfe commit adulterie. Which (if it be true, which I leaue to the iudgement of the Church,) prooueth euidently that the Iudiciall law of Moses is not of sorce. These are S. Austens words: Haec verba Apostoli tot
                           •
                        es repetita, toties inculcata, vera sunt, viua sunt, sana sunt, plana sunt. Nulltus viri posterioris mulier 
                     
                        August. ad Pollen. lib. 2. ca. 4. tom. 6. 
                     vxor esse incipit, nisi prioris esse desiuerit. Esse autem desinet prioris, simoriatur vir eius, non sifornicetur. These words of th' Apostle so often repeated, so often inculcated, are true, are quick, are sound, are plaine. A woman beginneth not to bee the wife of any later husband, vnlesse shee first cease to bee the wife of the former. But shee ceaseth to bee the former husbands wife, if her husband die, not if hee commit adulterie.
                  
                     Hemingius a great learned man, and a zealous professor of the Gospell, hath these words; Est & lex Iudicialis, quae

There is also the Iudiciall lawe, which expired with the common-wealth of Moses: so that it doth not binde any man of necessitie, but so farre onely, as some portion of it, partaineth to the lawe of Nature, as the lawe against incestuous marriages: or so much of it, as the ci

In the Lawe, both the adulterer and the adulteresse were punished by death; and they could not say, wee are penitent, & desire pardon for our sinnes. But among Christians, there is no commandement to punish them with death.
                  M Musculus that most zealous Christian, and great learned Doctor, hath these expresse words: Quaerunt, an tota sit abrogata? respondemus, si totus Moses cessit Christe, vtique tota illius lex, cessit legi Christi. Sequitur: in lege sunt mandata, promissa, & figurae. Perveritatem Christi, cessarunt promissa & figurae. Mandata legis sunt moralia, iudicialia, coeremontalia. Caeremo
                           •
                        ialia cessasse, ex eo patet quod ipsum Sacerdotium legis, cuiannexae fuerunt caeremoniae, per sacerdotium Christi secundum or dinem Melchisedech est abrogatum, & iam olim re ipsa cessauit. Iudicialta quoque cessasse in eo declaratur, quod tota Israelis oeconomia qualem terrae promissae inhabitatio requirebat, ab eo tempore cessauit, quo exdulsi inter gentes, sine Rege, sine Ducibus, siue Sacerdote, & sine lege habitare coeperūt.
                  
                  They demand, if the whole Law be abrogated? wee answere, if whole Moses gaue place to Christ, then hath his whole law giuen place to the lawe of Christ. In the Lawe are commandements, promises, and figures. The commandements of the law are morall, iudiciall, ceremoniall. That the ceremonialls are ceasled, it is thereby euident; for that the Priesthoode of the lawe, to which the ceremonies were annexed, is abrogated by the Priesthood of Christ, according to the order of Melchisedeth, & was long since expired. And that the iudicialls are also ceased, it is herein manifest; for that the whole order of the gouernment of Israell, which was requisite vnto the inhabiting of the land of promise, hath frō that time ceased, when they being expelled, beganne to dwell among the Gentiles, without a King, without gouernours, without a Priest, & wt out a law.
                  Maister Caluin hath a large and most learned discourse of this question, which is able to satisfie anie indifferent Musculus in locus de legib. pag Reader. Some small part thereof I will here set down, referring the Reader vnto the place for the residue.



                     Sunt qui recte compositā esse remp. negent, quae neglectis Mosis politicis, communibus gentium legibus regitur. Quae sententta 
                     
                        Caluin. in instit. lib. 4. cap. 20. Sect. 14. 15. 16. 
                     quam periculosa sit & turbulenta, videriut alij, mihi falsam esse ac stolidam, demonstrasse satis erit.
                  
                  There be some which denie that common weale to bee well gouerned, which omitting the politique lawes of Moses, is ruled by the common lawes of the Gentles. The which opinion how daungerous & seditious it is, let others iudge; it is enough for mee to haue shewed it to bee false and foolish.
                  Out of these large and learned discourses, it is most apparant to all indifferent Readers; that the law of Moses is wholie expired, and that Christians of necessitie are bound to no part thereof.
               
               
                  The Second Conclusion.
                  Although the law of Moses bee wholy expyred, so as of necessitie Christians are not bounde to the punishment therein prescribed against sinne & sinners, yet is sinne this day as odious in Gods sight, as euer it was, and remaineth punishable by the law Morall, (which is the law of Nature) more fullie explained in the Law of the Newe Testament; but the quantitie & kinde of punishment therein omitted, by reason of the mutabilitie of times, places, and persons, is wholly referred to the discretion of the wise & Godly Magistrate. This conclusion containeth in it three parts: the expiration of the Mosaicall law: Gods wrath and indignation against sinne, & the quantitie & kinde of punishing sinne, which is cōmitted to the Magistrate. The first part is sufficiently cleered, by the context of the former cōclusion. The second part may be prooued by manie places of holie writ. For as th' Apostle saith: Tribulation & anguish shalbe vpon the soule of euery man, that doth euill: of the Iew first, & also of the Graecian. Again, in another place, the wages of 
                        Rom. 2. 9. Rom 6. 23. sinne, is death. Again, therefore shall her plagues come at one day, death and sorrowe, and famine, and shee shall bee



                     burnt with fire; for that God which condemneth her, is a strong 
                     
                        Apoc. 17. 8. 
                     Lord. And Christ himselfe sheweth his generall hatred against sinne, when hee pronounceth life eternall to 
                        Mat. 25, v.
                      be prepared for the righteous, and euerlasting paine    for the wicked. The third and last part is proued two waies; affirmatiuely, and negatiuely. Of the former speaketh S. Paul, when hee telleth vs, That the Magistrate 
                        Rom. 13. v. 3 is not to be feared for good workes, but for euil.    Where hee rendreth the reason thereof: vz. for that he is Gods Minister, to take vengeance on him, that doth euill. Of the same speaketh Saint Peter, when hee affirmeth the magistrate to bee appointed of God, for the punishment of euill doers, and for the prayse of them 1. Pet. 2. v.
                      that doe well. Touching the latter there is no parte 14. in the whole corpse of the new testament, or of the old this day in force, which determineth eyther the quantitie or kinde of punishment, with the which male factors are to bee punished. This negatiue assertion is proofe sufficient, vntill some instance can bee giuen for the affirmatiue. Againe, as the Prophets containe nothing, but an explication of the Law; so the New Testament containeth nothing but a cleare explication of the law and the Prophetes. This I haue elsewhere In the downfall of Popery. proued at large, where hee that listeth may reade the same: for all the kindes of punishment expressed in the Mosaicall Law were meere iudiciall, and are alreadie expired, as is proued in the former conclusion. The law Moral, (which is the law of nature) teacheth vs that 
                        Vide supra, cap. 8. aphor. 3 ob. 2. sinne ought to be punished; but for that no one kinde of punishment, not quantity in punishing, can be meet and agreeable to all nations, all times, all places, and al persons; it leaueth the quantitie and kinde of punishment to bee determined by the godly and prudent Magistrate, as shall bee thought most fit and commodious for the peaceable gouernement of the common weale, the circumstances of times, places and persons,



euer dulie considered this is euident, by the practise of 
                        Caluin. in. in st
                              •
                           t. lib. 4. cap. 20. secti. 16. all nations; for (as M. Caluin writeth truely,) where Gods law (the law of nature,) forbiddeth to steale, the ancient lawes of the gentiles punished theft with double; others condemned theues with exile and bannishment; others adiudged them to be whipped; others to be put to death. False witnes was punished in som places onely with infamie, in other places with hanging. All lawes doe reuenge murder with blood, but yet with diuers kinds of death. In some places there are grieuouser paines appointed for adulterers, in other places those that are more easie; yet wee see, how they all by this diuersitie of punishment, tend to one and the same end. For they all with one consent, giue sentence of punishment against those offences, which are condemned by the eternall lawe of god; to wit, murder, theft, adulterie, false witnes; but they agree not all; in the manner of the punishment: neithe truely is it necessarie or expedient, that they should agree therein. Their is a countrey which should out of hand be destroied with theues and slaughter, if it did not with horible example deale verie sharpely with murderers. There is also some time, which requireth the enlarging of the sharpnes of punishment, and some people verie prone to some certaine sinne, vnlesse they be with great rigour kept in awe, he is then very euill affected and enuieth the publike commoditie, that is offended with this diuersitie, which is most meete to retaine the obseruatiō of the law of God. Thus writeth M. Caluin, adding much more to the like 1. effect; which I omit in regard of breuitie, referring the 
                        Rom. 1. v. 31. reader to the place; out of whose words I note first, that all nations who haue (as S. Paule recordeth) the law of 
                        Rom. 2. v. 14. nature ingrafted in their harts, did not agree in the kind of punishing sin, but vsed some one kind, some another. 2. Secondly, that theft, murder, false witnesse, adulterie and such like, haue not one and the same kinde of



punishment, in euerie people & natiō. Thirdly, that addultery is punished in some places sharply, in other som 3. places more gentlie. Fourthly, that his diuersitie of the 4. kinds of punishment, is not onely godly and lawfull, but also expedient and necessarie. And so, I conclude, that the law morall, (which onely law is now in force) doth leaue the quantitie and kinde of punishment, to be determined by the ciuill Magistrate.
               
               
                  The third Conclusion.
                  Emperours and Empresses, Kinges and Queenes, absolute Princes and independant Magistrats, may lawfully in certaine causes, vpon good and godlie considerations, either tolerate sinne vnpunished, or pardon male factors. For the exact handling of this conclusion, (because it is a matter of great importāce, & very necessary for many respects.) I deem it operapretiū
                      & agreable to the time in which we liue, to lay down some strōg the first. foundation. foundations in that behalfe. First, this is a constant Axiome, approued by vniform assent of al learned diuines Cess inte fine legis, cessat lex ipsa. When the finall cause or end for which the law was made, ceaseth, then doth the law of necessitie also cease. This foundation is grounded vpon the holy scripture; where by the flat 
                        act. 15. v. 28. 29. decree and setled law of the apostles, wee are bounde to abstaine frō blood & strangled meates. This notwithstanding, no man hath this day anie scruple of conscience to eate the same; & yet hereof no other sound reason can be yeelded, saue onely that the end for which that law was made, did lōg sithēce cease. For euē at that time was no precise necessitie, to abstaine from blood and strangled meates; But this law was onely made, in respect of the state of that time; that the Gentiles and the Iewes might liue more peaceably together, & there let this point be well marked. by avoid all occasion of contention and quarreling. And I therefor so soone as that end ceased, the law also



ceased with it, and so we are this day freede from the same, yea, this Axiome is euident lumine naturali, euen by the light of nature: for euery law is made for some end, which end how often soeuer it may bee accomplished without the law, so often the execution of the law is needeles.
                  Secondly, wee must holde this for a constant foundation, The second foundation. that albeit the ciuill Magistrate be commaunded to punish malefactors, yet is neither the kinde of punishment, nor the quantitie thereof taxed by the law of God, but it still abideth indifferent, to bee determined by the supreme ciuill Magistrate: (for as I haue 
                        Uide praeced. conclus. Vide supr. cap. 8. aphor. 3. in resp. ad 2 obiectionem
                      alreadie proued,) although there were speciall punishment prescribed in the iudiciall law of Moses, for transgressors of the Sabboth, for adulterers, for false witnesses, for murderers, theeues and such like, yet neither by the Law morall, nor by any Law in the New Testament, (to which lawes onely we Christians are this day bound,) is any such punishment determined, & therefore may the ciuill Magistrate, (if it so seeme good vnto him.) chaunge the vsuall punishment of theeues, (which with vs is to bee hanged,) and cause them to be cast into the sea with milstones about their neckes: and the same may bee saide, of the punishment for other malefactors.
                  Thirdly, wee must repute this for an vndoubted foundation; vz. that the end, for which Gods Law appointeth The third foundation. malefactors to be punished, is the publike peace and good of the whole common-weale: for this is so euident by the course of the whole scripture, as it can neither with learning nor reason bee denied. 
                        Deut. 19. 20 1. Cor. 5. 13. 1. Tim. 5. 20 1. Cor. 8. 13. Mat 18, 6. The first correla

                  Out of these three foundations, thus firmely stablished, these two Corrolaries, may euidently bee inferred. First, that whensoeuer, any member of the common weale committeth any capitall crime, for which hee ought to die by the law, whose life for all that is



more profitable to the weale publike then his death; in such a case the Prince may pardon such a malefactor, & not thereby sinne at all: which thing christian Princes seeme to respect, when in the time of warres, they set such felons at libertie, as are able to doe seruice in defence of the Realme. Secondly, that when any malefactor The second Corollarie. is so mightie, or so strongly seated, or otherwise so vnfit to bee dealt withall, that the Prince cannot without probable daunger of his royal person, or great domage to the common-weale, punish the said malefactor; then in such a case, the prince may tollerate such a malefactor vnpunished, and not thereby sinne at all. These foundations and illations being once well vnderstoode and remembred, the conclusion (though of great moment,) cannot but be manifest and cleare. Neuerthelesse, I will adioyne some sound reasons hereunto, for the better confirmation of the same.
               
               
                  The first reason.
                  It is a common and generally receiued Maxime, aswell of all Ciuilians as Diuines; vz. Lex non obligat vltra intentionem legis-latoris. The law doth not bind a mā beyond the intention of the Law-maker. Whereupon I inferre first, that the ciuill magistrate may dispence 1. with his owne Law. Secondly, that the Prince being 2. Gods Minister, may tollerate or pardon malefactors, when, and so often as such tolleration or pardoning tendeth to the common good of the publike-weale, the reason is euident, because the intention of God the supreme Law-maker, was euen that and none other, whē hee appointed his ministers to punish malefactors.
                  
                     The obiection.
                     The Prince pardoneth many times, when hee little



regardeth the common good; nay, whē his pardoning doth great harme to the publike weale, and Church of God.
                  
                  
                     The Answere.
                     I aunswere; first, that hee hath receiued his authoritie to profite the Church and common-weale, and 1. not to doe hurt vnto the same. Secondly, that it is sufficient to satisfie the consciences of subiectes, (who 2. haue not to examine their Soueraignes secret affaires, and to enquire what causes he hath to deale thus, and so in matters of State) that the Prince may in some cases vpon some causes, either tollerate sin vnpunished, Marke this point well. or pardon malefactors. If the case were otherwise, euery subiect might soone take occasion to rebell If the Prince abuse his authority, he must render an account to God for the same.
                  
               
               
                  The second Reason.
                  Prodigalitie is a great sinne, condemned aswell in Philosophie, as in Diuinitie; it neither will nor can bee Christian Kinges. denyed. It is the exceeding extreame of the vertue liberal
                        •
                     tie. This notwithstanding all Christian Kinges (for ought that I can learne) haue euer tolerated the same vnpunished at least in some degree; neither were they for such tollerations reproued at any time by any ancient approued writer, or learned Father whatsoeuer. Which doubtles is 
                        •
                     nd ought to be so reputed an argument of no small importance, For although Emporour, Kinges and Monarches, may and doe sinne aswell as others of meaner calling; yet neither did they, neyther euer can they liue vnreproued; if at any time they sin notoriously, either by stabilishing wicked lawes



publikly, or by suffering their subiects to make hauock o
                        •
                      Gods lawes dissolutely. For God can raise vp children of stones to Abraham; and neither is hee, nor euer 
                        Mat. 3. 9. will hee be destitute of faithfull couragious seruāts, who wil constantly, and without all feare, reproue all such as contemne his holy lawes. He hath watchmen on the wals of his Ierusalem, who will crie out against sin 
                        Esa. 62. 6. continually, and neuer keepe silence day nor night. He is not without his Elias, that will stoutely reproue all wicked Achabs, Hee hath in store a Daniel, to condemne 1. Reg. 18. all naughtie Iudges, and to acquit his faithfull    
                     Susannes. Hee will finde a Prophet to exclame against 
                        Dan. 13. 16. idolatrie, and to teach euery Ieroboam his dutie. He can and wil prouide an other Iohn Baptist, to speake boldely 1. Reg. 13. 2. to all bloody Herods. And yet in so many hundred yeares, such tollerations haue neuer beene reprooued to my knowledge by any auncient Father, or other learned VVriter. The reason hereof I take to bee this; because if this sinne were punished, there woulde rather hurte then benefite insue therevppon.
               
               
                  The third reason
                  It is a generall Maxime receiued not onely in Diuinitie, but in Philosophie also; Ex duobus malis, minus eligendum. Of two euils the lesser is to bee chosen, that is to say; when two euils concur, so that both cannot be auoided, but that necessarilie the one must happen; then it is not onclie not sinne, but godlie VVisedome, and Christian Policie, to preuent, and auoide the greater euill, with permission and tolleration of the lesse. For example sake; it is euill for a man to cutte off his owne arme or legge, if the thing bee absolutely, and simply considered in it selfe, yet to cut it off



least the whole bodie putrifie or perish; is a very lawful act. Which thing all Christian Princes, & Monarches seeme to respect, when they in sundrie cases doe tollerate sinne vnpunished. The blessed man Moses, so highly renowned in holy writte, pardoned great malefactors in the hainous crime of diuorce, and this tolleration he graunted to auoide a greater euill; that is to say, least the Iewes vpon euery light cause should poyson those wiues whome they did not loue, for that such light diuorcement was onely permitted, but neyther by God, not by Moses approued; I will demonstrate by these 1. important and insolluble reasons. First, because these are Christes owne wordes; Moses because of the hardenesse of your heartes, suffered you to put away your 
                        Mat. 5. 31. Mat. 19. 7. wiues, but frō the beginning it was not so. Secondly, because the mariage was indeed after suchlight diuource, 2. vnlawfull by the law. For thus writeth Saint Paul; know 
                     
                        Deus. 24. v. 1 
                     yee not Brethren (for I speak to them that know the Law) that 
                     
                        Rom. 7. v. 1. 
                     the law hath dominiō ouer the mā, as long as he liueth; for the womā
                      
                     2. 3. 
                     which is in subiection to a mā, is bound by the Law to the Mā, while hee liueth; but if the man be di ade, shee is deliuered from the law of the man: So then if while the man liueth, shee take an other mā, she shal be called an adulteresse. Out of these words I note first, that marriage cannot bee dissolued, during 1. the life of the former husband. I note secondly, that this was so euen in Moses law; because Saint Paul saith 2. hee speaketh to them that knew the law, I note thirdly, 3. that to be married after diuorce for a light cause, during the life of the former husband is plaine & flat adulterie. I therefore conclude, that to tollerate sinne vnpunished vpon good cause, is no sin at all. This mine assertion of diuorcement is not onely grounded vpon the Scriptures, but also confirmed by the holy fathers, and best approued writers of this our age.
               
               
                  
                  
                     The 4. Reason.
                  
                  We haue many examples in the holy scriptures of blessed mē that often pardoned Malefactors, & to this day were neuer reproued for the same. King Dauid pardoned 1. Sam. 25. v. 35. 2 Sam. 3. v. 6. 22. 28. 31. 2. Sam. 3. 1. Reg. 2. v. 8. 9. gen. 34. wicked Nabal at the peticion of his vertuous wife Abigal. The same king Dauid pardōed Abner, who rebelled against him for the house of Saul. The self same king tolerated Ioab in his naughtie dealings, albeit he was more then a little offended with his manners. The same king tolerated cursed Shemei, thogh he cōmanded his son Salomon to do execution on thē both, after that him selfe was dead. The holy Patriarch Iacob did not punnish his sonnes Simcon and Leuie with death, for their cruell murder done vpon the Sechemites; though 
                        vided August. epist. 119. he had plaine regall and supreame authoritie ouer thē 
                     S. Austen did verie often intreate the Emperours most earnestly and humbly, not onely to pardon heretickes, but also the Circumcellions most naughtie people and cruell murderers. The blessed virgin Mary was found to bee with child by the holy Ghost, befor S. Ioseph & shee came together. Whereupon Ioseph, because he was 
                        mat. 1. 19. a iust man, and would not put her to open shame, was minded to put her away priuily, thus reporteth holy writ. Out of which wordes I note first, that Ioseph knew the holy virgin to be with childe. Secondly that 1. he knew him selfe not to be the father of the childe. 2. Thirdly, that Ioseph knew no other, but that Mary his 3. wife was an adultresse. Fourthly, that he thoght to haue 4. put her a way secretly, so to keepe her from shame & punishment. Fiftly, that Ioseph was euen then deemed iust, when the sought and thought to keepe her from 5. shame; although in his iudgement, she deserued death by the law. Yea, S. Paul him selfe made intercession to Philemon for his seruant One simus, though he had beene in epist. ad philem. a vagabond and theuish fellow.
                  
                     
                     The first obiection.
                     No inferiour hath power to alter the law of his superiour; and consequently, man cannot pardon or tolerate malefactors, whō god appointeth to be punished
                  
                  
                     The answer
                     I answer; first that precepts deliuered to vs in holy writ 
                           vide. D. Zanch in 4. cap. ad ep
                                 •
                              es. Pag 338. et Martyr. in 2. lib. Samuel. cap. 3. pag. 200. Aquenatem. 2. 2. q. 3. art. 2. cap. Rom. 10. v 9. 10. Mat. 7. 6. are of two sorts. Some affirmatiue, other some negatiue. The negatiue bind vs at all times euery houre, and in euery place; but the affirmatiue, thogh they be very apt to bind, yet doe they not actually bind vs, saue then onely, when the due circumstances of times, places, and persons occurre, hereupon it commeth that it is neuer lawfull to steale, neuer lawful to commit addultery, neuer lawfull to beare false witnes, neither at any time, nor in anie place. the reason hereof is this, because these precepts be negatiue. This notwithstanding, it is sometime lawfull to omit the precepts affirmatiue. For exāple it is necessary vnto saluatiō, to mak confession of our faith; and yet we doe and may often omit the same, for that it is an affirmatiue precept. And therfore Christ willeth vs not to giue that which is holy to dogs; neither to cast our pearles before swine; leaste they tr
                           •
                        ad thē vnder their feete, and turne againe & al to rentus. But wee are then bound to confesse our faith when either it tendeth to the glorie of God, or to the good of our neighbour; so that if such confession were not then made, either god should be dishonoured, or our neighbour scandalized. So it is Gods cōmandemēt to giue him thy cloake, that will sue the at the law, and take away thy caate; & yet maiest thou at sundry times 
                           Mat. 5. v. 40 for sundry respects, denie him both thy coate and thy cloake. So it is Gods commaundement to go with him myles twaine, that will compell the to goe one; and yet maiest thou sundrie times denie lawfully, to 
                           Mat. 5. v. 41 goe with him either more or lesse so it is Gods commaundement,



neuer to turne away frō him, that would 
                           Mat. 5 v. 42. borrow money of the, or any other goods; and yet maiest thou sundry times for sundry respects, denie to lend either thy mony or other things. All which and other the like haue this onely ground and foundation; vz. That they are precepts, affirmatiue, which neither bind at all times, nor yet in all places. For precepts affirmatiue, modus loquendi. Scholarum. to vse schoole-tearmes; obligant semper sed non ad semper.
                     
                     Secondly, that the ciuill magistrate had authoritie, to mitigate many punishmēts ordained for malefactors, Secundò. Principaliter. euen in the time of the old testamēt. For thogh he were appointed to punish them that vsed false weights and measures; yet was that punishment to be determined 
                           Deut. 25. v. 2. 3. 13. 14. according to the quantitie and qualitie of his trespasse. The partie that was worthy to be beaten, receiued many or few stripes, at the descretiō of the magistrate. M. Caluin a most zealous patron of pure religion, hath 
                           Caluin. in leu. 18. v. 6. Pag. 345. these expresse words; Impunè quidem vt liceat statui potest, sicut in arbitio Principis est panas remittere. Verum vt vitiosum non sit, quod vitiosum esse natura dictat, nullus legislator efficiet
                     
                     A law may be made, that he which doth it shall not be punished; euen as it is in the princes pleasure, to pardon and releasse the punishment. But that that be not sinfull, which nature it selfe sheweth to be sinfull; no law maker can effect or bring to passe. Thus writeth this learned man, granting freely as we see; that the magistrate may sometime vpon good causes, tolerate those sinnes vnpunished, which gods law doth sharply reproue and speake against, where the reader must obserue with me, that Maister Caluin speaketh of the most notorious sinnes of incest; and consequently that hee graunteth power vnto the magistrate, to pardon what Malefactors or sinnes, so euer: For though the magistrate can neuer make that



to be no sinne, which Gods lawe prounceth to bee sinne; yet (saith M. Caluin) the magistrate may make a law, that the same sinne shal not be punished, Which doubtles is the selfe same doctrine, that I do teach for the present.
                     Thirdly, that by the law of the New Testament, the Prince is onely charged in generall tearmes to punish Tertiò principaliter. malefactors, and that for the common good of his faithfull people, in regard whereof, hee may lawfullie cease from punishing them; when the common intended good of his subiectes, eyther can not, or wil not insue thereupon. For if Kinges should at all times punish all malefactors; the Church of God would often be depriued of most excelent and profitable members. For which respect our Sauiour himselfe telleth vs, that when the tares cannot be seuered from the good corn, 
                           Mat. 13. v. 3
                              •
                           . vnlesse both be pulled vp together; then may they tollerate the tares or weedes with the good corne, vntill the time of haruell. As if hee had saide: when the wicked cannot be punished, but with great domage to the godly; then may the Magistrate tollerate such malefactors 
                           Aug. ut ep. 110. tom. 2. vnpunished, and not thereby sinne at all. Therefore saith the holy father S. Austen; that Christes Church doth tollerate many thinges, which he neither doth nor can approue. And the same holy Father in a large and learned discourse against Parmenianus, shew eth plainely vnto the Reader; that the notorious sins must then be anathematized, when there is no daunger of schisme to enfue thereupon, not otherwise; least that turn to the churches harm, which was intended for her good. Amongst many other godly sentences, (which for breuitie I here omitte, these are his expresse wordes. In hac velut angustia quaestionis, non aliquid nou

                        anathemate dignus habeatur, fiat hoc vbi periculum schismatis nullum est. Sequitur nam & ipse dominus cum seruis volentibus zizania colligere, dixit, sinite vtraque crescere vsque ad messem, praemisit causam dicens, neforte cum vultis colligere zizania eradicetis, simul & triticum: Vbi satis osteudit, cum metus iste non subest, sed omnino de frumentorum certa stabilitate certa securitas manet, id est, quando ita cuiusque crimen notum est omnibus, & omnibus execrabile apparet, vt velnullos prorsus, vel non tales habeat defensores per quos possit schisma contingere, nō dormi

                           t seueritas disciplinae. Sequitur, cum vero idem morbus plurimos occupaucrit, nihil aliud bonis restat, quam dolor & gomitus.
                     
                     In this intricate question, I wil say no new or strāge thing, but euen that which the soundenes of the church obserueth; that when any Christian, which in the societie of the church, shalbe taken with any such offéce, as shall deserue an anathematization, the same be done where there is no perill of schisme. For our Lorde himselfe, when hee saide to those that woulde gather the tares, suffer them to grow vntill the haruest; premised the cause, saying, least while yee desire to gather the tares, ye plucke vp also the wheate. VVhere hee sheweth sufficiently; that when there is no such feare, but there abideth securitie enough of the stabilitie of the corne, that is, when euerie mans crime is so apparant and execrable to all, that eyther it hath none at al, or no such patrones as are able to raise vp a schisme, then may not the seueritie of discipline bee a sleepe. But when many haue the same disease, there resteth nothing for the godly, but sorrowe and lamentation. Thus writeth this holy Father; Out of whose wordes we may gather euidently, that the magistrate may lawfully tollerate sinne and sinners vnpunished, when by their punishment more hurt then good would ensue to the Church. VVhich selfe same doctrine, King Dauid full of the holy Ghost, deliuered long afore



him, when he vttered these wordes; Know ye not, 'that there is a Prince, and a great man fallen this day in Israel? and I am this day weake and newly annointed King, and these men the

                        sonnes of Zeruiah be too hard for me; the Lord reward the doer of euill, according to his wickednesse. Loc, the blessed King spared two most cruell murderers, Ioab and Abishai his brother; and this hee did onelie for this end, least by their punishment, greater hurt should haue come vnto his Kingdome.
                  
                  
                     
                        The 2. Obiection.
                     
                     
                        Achab the King of Israel was punished with death because he granted pardon to Benhadad King of Aram. 
                        1. Reg. 20. 1. Sam. 28. 1. Sam. 15. So King Saul was deposed from his kingdome, for that he spared Agag king of the Amalekites.
                     
                  
                  
                     Answere.
                     I aunswere; first, that Achab was precisely designed 1. by God himselfe, to doe execution vpon Benhadad. And so was also Saul appointed in precise tearmes, to put 1. Reg. 20. 42. 1. Sam. 15. 3 King Agag to death. Secondly, that in the New Testament, Princes haue no such special commaundemēt, 2. but are only charged in general to punish malefactors. Thirdly, that they were extraordinarie precepts, giuen 3. to these Kinges extraordinarilie, not to bee done generally to all malefactors, but to two notorious persons in speciall; and consequently, that no generall Law can bee grounded thereupon. Fourthly, that affirmatiue precepts binde not in euery season, but when the due 4. circumstances of time, place and persons, and the common good of the faithfull, shal so require, as is alreadie proued. For otherwise, I see not how Saint Paul can bee excused, who made earnest sute to Philemon, to pardon In Epist. ad Philem. his wicked seruant Onesimus, who vniustly had gone away out of his seruice. And the like may bee saide of



Saint Austin, who so ofiē made intercession to the princes of Africa, to pardon the Donatists and Circumcellions; who did not onelie disturbe religion, but also spoiled the Christians of their lawfull goodes. Yea, it was the vsuall custome of the Iewes, (as the holy gospel 
                           Luke 23. v. 17. beareth recorde,) to see some one Prisoner at libertie euerie Easter; which custome is not reproued in 
                           Mat. 27. v. 15. any place of holy writ. Fiftly, that it is a case so cleare by Saint Paul, that male factors may sometime bee pardoned, 
                           Mar. 15. 6. as it is without all rime and reason to denic the same. For what can be a greater offence, then such fornication, as is not once named among the Gentiles; 2. Cor. 
                                 •
                              . v. 8. 9. 10. to wit, that one should haue hi fathers wife. And yet when the partie that did this horrible fact, seemed to giue signes of true remorse; Then Saint Paul himselfe pardoned him, and willed the Corinthians to doe the same. So did the Fathers of the Elebertine Councel, pardon the vsurers of the Laical sort; when they promised 
                           Conc. Elebcr, can. 20. to surcease from vsurie, and to deale no longer therewith. And this Coūcel was celebrated aboue one thousand and two hundred yeares ago. Yea, the most famous Councel of Nice gaue pardō to such malefactors, 
                           Conc. Nicen. can. 11. as scarse deserued the same any way. I therefore conclude, that it is lawfull for Kinges, Emperours, and other independant Magistrates, to tollerate or pardō malefactors vnpunished, when and so often as the same shall tend to the good of the common weale; wherein Subiects are to obey, and not peremptorily to iudge, or curiously to examine, and enquire.
                     Soli Deo gloria.
