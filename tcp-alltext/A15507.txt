            A
PREPARATORY
PRAYER
Before Sacramentall Confession.
            O Maker of heauen &
earth, King of Kings
and Lord of Lords, who
hast made me of nothing
vnto thy Image and similitude,
& hast redeemed
me with thy owne
pretious bloud, whome

I a sinner am not worthy
to name, nor call vpon,
nor yet to thinke of, in
hart. I meekly beseech
thee, and humbly pray
thee, that thou wouldst
respect with clemency
me thy wicked seruant.
And haue mercy vpon
me, who tookest pitty
vpon the woman of Canaan,
& Mary Magdalen:
who spard'st the Publican,
and the Theefe hā
               ging
vpon the Crosse.
            
               
To thee I confesse, O
most louing Father, my
sinnes, which, O Lord,
if I would I cannot hide
from thee. Spare me, o
christ whom I haue lately
much offēded in thinking,
speaking, and doing,
& by all the wayes
in which I frayle worme
and a sinner might offend
through my fault,
through my fault, thorogh
my most grieuous
fault. Therefore, O

Lord, I beseech thy
Clemency, who camest
downe from heauen for
my saluation, who liftedst
vp Dauid from the
fall of sinne, spare me o
Lord, spare me o Christ
who sparedst Peter denying
thee. Thou art
my Creatour, and my
Redeemer, my Lord, &
my Sauiour, my King,
and my God. Thou art
my hope, and my trust,
my stay, and my helpe,

my consolation, and my
fortitude; my defence,
and my deliuerance; my
life, my saluation, and
my resurrection; my
light, and my desire; my
ayde, & my patronage.
I beseech and pray thee
help me, and I shall be
safe: gouerne me, and
defend me; comfort, &
consolate me; confirme
and glad me; enlighten
me, and visite me. Raise
me being dead, because

I am thy creature and
worke. O Lord, despise
me not, for that I am
thy seruant and vassall:
and although euill, although
vnworthy and a
sinner, yet such as I am,
whether good or euill,
alwayes I am thyne. Vnto
whome shall I flye,
except I go to thee? If
thou cast me off, who
will receaue me? If thou
despise me, who wil behold
me? Re-acknowledge

me therfore thogh
vnworthy returning vnto
thee. For if I am vile,
and vncleane, thou
canst cleanse me: if I be
blind, thou canst enlighten
me: if I be feeble,
thou canst heale me
                  •
                if
I be dead and burryed,
thou canst reuiue me,
because thy Mercy is
greater then my iniquity:
greater is thy piety,
then my impiety: more
thou canst pardon, then

I commit: & more thou
canst forgiue, then I a
sinner offend. Therfore
o Lord despise me not,
nor yet regard the multitude
of my iniquities,
but according to the
multitude of thy cōmiserations
haue mercy on
me, a most grieuous sinner.
Say to my soule, I
am thy saluation; who
said
                  •
               st: I will not the
death of a sinner, but rather
that he be conuerted

and liue: turne me,
O Lord vnto thee, and
do not extend thyne anger
against me. I beseech
thee▪ o most clement Father,
for thy mercy, I
bow downe and earnestly
pray thee, that thou
direct me vnto a good
end, and vnto true pennance,
pure confession,
and worthy satisfaction,
for al my sinnes. Amen.
            
               
               Another Prayer before Sacramentall
Confession.
               REceaue my confessiō
O most benigne, and
most clement Lord 
                     〈◊〉
                  
Christ, the only hope of
the saluatiō of my soule,
and giue vnto me (I beseech
thee) contrition of
hart, and teares to myne
eyes, that I may bewaile
day and night all my
negligences with humility
and purity of hart.

Let my prayer o Lord,
approach neere in thy
sight. If thou shalt be
angry against me, what
helper may I seeke? who
will haue mercy vpon
myne iniquityes? Remember
me, O Lord,
who didst cal the womā
of Canaan, and the Publican
to repentance, &
didst receaue Peter weeping.
O Lord my God,
accept my prayers: O
good Iesu, Sauior of the

world, who gauest thy
selfe to the death of the
crosse, that thou mightst
saue sinners, regard me
a wretched sinner, calling
vpon thy Name,
and regard not so my
wickednes that thou forget
thy goodnes. And
if I haue committed
ought, whereby thou
mayst condemne me, yet
thou hast not lost that
whereby thou art wont
to saue. Spare me therefore,

o Lord who art my
Sauiour, and take mercy
on my sinneful soule.
Loose the band thereof,
& heale the woundes, O
Lord Iesus. I desire thee,
I seeke thee, I will thee:
show me thy face, and I
shall be safe. Send forth
therefore, o most louing
Lord (through the merits
of the most pure and
immaculate euer Virgin
Mary thy Mother, and
thy Saintes) thy light,

and thy truth into my
soule, which may shew
vnto me truely all my
defects, which it behooueth
me to confesse; and
which may helpe and
teach me to expresse thē
fully, and with contrite
hart. Who liuest and raignest
God, world without
end. Amen.
            
         
         
            
            A BRIEFE
METHODE
OF CONFESSION,
            For those that frequent the same often.
            HE that is accustomed
to confesse often,
must be very carefull
of foure thinges. 1.
Of the due examē of his
Conscience. 2. Of compunction
and sorrow for
his sinnes. 3. Of the cō
               fession

it self, that it brief
and humble, & sincere.
4. Of ful purpose & true
endeauour to amend.
            This done let him
come hūbly to his Ghostly
Father, & kneeling
downe at his feet, say:
Benedicite. Confiteor Deo
Omnipotenti &c in Latin
or English, as he best can
vntill the wordes, Mea
culpa &c. Then say.
            First I accuse my selfe,
that I come to this Sacrament

of Pennance
not so well prepared as I
ought to doe: for which
I aske God hartily pardon.
            I accuse my selfe, that
I haue not had such sorrow,
and repentance for
my sins past as I ought:
for which I aske God
hattily pardon.
            I accuse my selfe, that
I haue not vsed such diligence
in the dayly examining
of my cōscience,

and amendment of my
life, as I ought to haue
done: for which I aske
God hartily pardon.
            I accuse my selfe, that
I haue greatly offended
Almighty God, in that
I haue not giuē him due
thankes for all his benefits
that I haue receaued
cōtinually at his hands,
for which I aske him
hartily pardon.
            I accuse my selfe, that
I haue not loued & serued

him with such feare,
and reuerence, and humility
of mind in all
thinges, as I ought to
haue done: for which I
aske him hartily pardō.
            I accuse my selfe, that
I haue not made my
prayers vnto him, with
that alacrity & feruour
of spirit as I ought, but
haue beene very often,
and voluntarily distracted,
slouthful, & could
in my prayers, deuotions,

and all other pious
workes, and exercises:
for which I aske him also
hartily pardon.
            I accuse my selfe, for
that I haue beene proud
& vaine glorious in my
inward thoughts & cogitations:
for which I
aske God hartily pardō.
            I accuse my selfe, for
that I haue beene very
negligent in putting away
euill thoughtes of
sundry sorts, and haue

not endeauoured to keep
my mind occupyed in
lawfull and Godly exercises,
nor thought so
humbly of my selfe, as I
should haue done: for
which I aske God hartily
pardon.
            I accuse my selfe, that
I haue not kept my senses
in such narrownes &
custody, as I ought to
haue done, especially my
eyes, and my eares: for
which I aske God hartily

pardon.
            I accuse my selfe, for
that I haue not spoken
of other men, and their
affaires, with that care,
charity, and affection, as
I should haue done, but
rather haue discouered
their defects: for which
I aske God hartily pardon.
            I accuse my selfe, that
I haue not behaued my
selfe so modestly in my
actions, and conuersations

as I should haue
done, but haue spent
many houres idly in desports,
laughing, & idle
discourses, without profit
to my selfe or others:
for which I aske God
hartily pardon.
            I accuse my selfe, that
in my workes I haue not
purely sought Gods honour
and glory, but rather
some worldly respect,
or selfe-content

                  •
               herein: for which I ask

God hartily pardon.
            I accuse my selfe, that
I haue not frequented
the holy Sacraments of
Confession, and Communion
with that due
preparatiō & reuerence,
as I ought to haue done:
nor heard Masse, or other
spirituall Exhortations
with that attentiō,
and deuotion, as was fit
for such diuine mysteryes:
for which I aske
God hartily pardon.
            
               
I accuse my selfe, that
I haue beene angry, melancholy,
froward, stubborne,
and very troublesome
to others often
tymes without cause: for
which I aske God hartily
pardon.
            I accuse my selfe, that
in my talke and other
discourses, I haue not
beene so careful to keep
my tongue from vttering
of some vntruthes,
nor from swearing by

Fayth & Troth without
necessity: for which I
aske God hartily pardō.
            For these, and all my
other sinnes and transgressions,
wherinsoeuer,
& howsoeuer els, I haue
offended my Lord God:
& also for those that at
this present I haue forgotten,
and through my
negligence cannot call
to remembrance, I aske
him hartily pardon and
forgiuenes, and of you

my Ghostly Father, pē
               nance,
and absolution.
Ideo precor Beatam Mariam
&c. Or, Therefore
I beseech the blessed &c.
            If besides this ordinary
method of Confessiō,
thou shalt feele thy conscience
troubled or burdened
with these, or any
other sinne, mortall or
veniall, thou must expresse
them distinctly &
orderly, withall their
due circūstances, to the

end thy Ghostly Father

               A short prayer to be sayd
presently after absolutio.
               LET, O Lord, I hū
                  bly
beseech thee, this
my Confession be grateful
and acceptable vnto
thy diuine Maiesty, by

the merites of 
                     〈…〉
                  
bitter death, and passiō
and by the 
                     〈…〉
                  
of thy Blessed Mother,
and all the Saints. And
that whatsoeuer, now,
or at other tymes hath
been wanting in me, either
to the sufficiency of
Contritiō, or to the purity
and integrity of my
Confession, let thy piety,
and mercy, O Lord,
supply the same; & according
therunto, vouchsafe

to absolue me
more fully and perfectly
in heauen. To whom
be all honour and glory
world without end. Amen.
Sweet Iesus, Amen.

to be healed, I flye vnder
thy protectiō: & he
whom I cannot endure,
a Iudge, I hope to haue a

Sauiour. To thee, O
Lord I shew my woūds:
to thee I discouer my
shame. I know my sins
to be many, and great,
for which I feare. I trust
in thy mercyes, which
are without number:
looke downe vpon me
with the eyes of thy
mercy, o lord Iesu christ
eternall King, God and
man, crucified for man.
Hear me graciously hoping
in thee: haue mercy

vpon me full of wretchednesse
and sin: thou
that wilt neuer restraine
the fountain of thy pietie
to flow. All haile
healthfull sacrifice, offered
vpon the tree of the
Crosse for me, and all
man-kind. All haile, O
noble & pretions bloud
gushing out of the woū
                  des
of my Lord Iesus
Christ crucifyed, & washing
away the sinnes of
the whole world. Remember,

O Lord thy
Creature, whome thou
hast redeemed with thy
bloud: it repenteth me,
that I haue sinned, I desire
to amend that which
I haue done. Take away
then from me, O most
clement Father, al mine
iniquities, and offences,
that purified in mind &
body, I may deserue
worthily to tast the holy
of holyes: and grant
that this holy tasting of

thy bodie and bloud,
which I vnworthy, desire
to receaue, may be a remission
of my sins, a perfect
purgation of my
crimes, a driuing away of
filthie cogitations, and a
re-engendring of good
thoughts, and also holesome
efficacie of workes
pleasing to thee, & withal
a most firme protection
of soule and body aagainst
the deceiptes of
my enemyes. Amen.
            
            
               
               Another prayer before receauing
the B. Sacrament.
               ALmighty & eternal
God, behold I come
to the Sacrament of thy
only begotten Son, our
Lord Iesus Christ. I repaire
as one being sicke
vnto the Phisitiā of life,
as one vncleane vnto
the fountaine of mercie,
as one blind to the light
of perpetuall brightnes,
as one poore and needy

to the Lord of heauen &
earth. I besiech thee therfore
by the aboūdance of
thy infinite bounty, that
thou wouldest vouchsafe
to cure my infirmitity,
to wash my filth, to enlighten
my blindnes, to
enrich my pouerty, to
cloth my nakednes: that
I may receaue thee, the
bread of Angels, King
of Kings, Lord of lords,
with so great reuerence
and humility, with so

great contrition and deuotion,
with so great puritie
and faith, with such
purpose and intent, as is
expedient for the health
of my soule: graunt me
I beseech thee, not only
to receaue the Sacramēt
of our Lords body, and
bloud, but also the thing
and vertue thereof. O
God most meeke, grant
me so to take the body
of thy only begottē Son
our Lord Iesus Christ,

which he tooke of the
Virgin Marie; that I may
deserue to be incorporated
to his misticall body,
& accounted among
the members therof. O
most louing Father, grāt
me for euer with open
face to behold thy beloned
Sonne, whome now
couered in this wayfare,
I desire to receaue. Who
togeather with thee, and
the Holy Ghost &c.
            
            
               
               A Prayer after receauing
the B. Sacrament.
               I Giue thee thankes, O
holy Lord, Father almighty,
eternall God,
who hast vouchsafed
to replenish me a sinner
thy vnworthy seruant,
through no merites of
myne, but by the only
vouchsafing of thy mercy,
with the pretious bodie
and bloud of thy son
our Lord Iesus Christ;

and I beseech thee, that
this holy receauing, may
not be to me as a guilt
vnto punishment, but as
a wholesome intercessiō
vnto pardon. Let it be
to me an armor of faith,
& a shield of good will:
let it be a cleansing of al
my vices, a driuer out of
concupiscence and lust,
an increase of Charity,
patience, humility, and
obedience: a firme defēce
against the wiles of

all enemies, aswel visible
as inuisible, a perfect
quieting of my motions
aswell carnall as spirituall,
a firme cleauing vnto
thee, one & true God:
and a happy consumation
of my end: and I beseech
thee that thou wilt
vouchsafe to bring me a
sinner, vnto that vnspeakeable
feast: where thou
with thy Sonne and the
holy Ghost, art a true

                     •
                  ight to thy Saints, a

complete fullnesse, an
euerlasting gladnes, an
absolute ioy, and a perfect
felicity. Through
Christ our Lord. Amen.
            
            
               Another prayer after receauing
the B. Sacrament.
               PIerce through, o sweet
Lord Iesu the marrow,
and bowells of my
soule, with the most
sweete, and holsome
wound of thy loue, with
thy true, cleere, most

ardent and holy Charity,
that my soule may
languish and melt, euen
by the only loue and desire
of thee; let it couet
thee, and euen languish
after thee at thy gates;
let it desire to be dissolued,
and to be with thee.
Graunt that my soule
may hunger after thee,
the bread of Angels, the
food of holy soules, our
daily & supersubstantial
bread, hauing all sweetnes,

and sauour, and all
delightfulnes in it selfe:

               Another Prayer after receauing
the B. Sacrament.
               O Lord Iesus Christ, I
humbly bessech thy
vnspeakable mercy, that

                  by
and bloud, which I
(vnworthy) haue receaued,
may be to me a purging
of offences, a fortitude
against frailtyes, a
fortresse against the perils
of the world, an obtaining
of pardō, an establishment

of grace, a
medicine of life, a memory
of thy passion, a
nourishmēt against weakenes,
& a rest of my pilgrimage.
Let it guide me
going, reduce me wandering,
receaue me returning
againe, vphold
me stumbling, lift me
vp falling, and perseuering
bring me into glory.
O highest God, let
the most blessed presence
of thy body and bloud

so alter the tast of my
hart, that besides thee
at any tyme it feele no
sweetnesse, it loue no
fairenes, it seeke no vnlawfull
loue, it desire no
consolation, it admit no
delectation or pleasure,
it care for no honour, it
feare no cruelty. Who
liuest and raignest, with
God the Father, in the
vnity of the Holy
Ghost, world without
end. Amen.
            
         
         
            
            BRIEFE
MEDITATIONS
FOR THE SEAVEN
dayes of the VVeeke,
In imitation of seauen vertues of
our Blessed Sauiour.
            By the R. Father Luke Pinelli, of
the Society of IESVS.
            
               SVNDAY.
               Of Christs Humility.
               1. COnsider the humility,
which

the Son of God manifested
in his Incarnation,
in which for thee he
annihilated himselfe, taking
vpon him the form
of a seruant, the Lord of
Maiesty became thy seruant,
to do thee seruice,
he came downe heauen,
where the Angells were
attendant vpon him, &
for an ample testimony
of his humble seruice to
thee, he pleased to be
borne in a stable.
               
                  
2. Consider, how
this Lord of heauen, a
while after hūbled himselfe
much more in his
Natiuity, when first he
subiected his most tender
and delicate body to
circumcision, and declared
himselfe as a sinner,
and standing in need of
a remedy (for Circumcision
was a signe of sin,
and a remedy against it)
& he vouchsafed to nū
                  ber
himselfe among sinners,

al the world beholding
it: and how more
vile, and abiect could he
make himselfe, then
to take vpon him the
forme of a seruant, and
to be borne in a stable?
               3. Consider the great
affection of humility,
that our Sauiour exercised
in Iordan, when he
pleased to be baptized
by S. Iohn Baptist, where
contemning his own reputation,
he stood amiddest

base persons, and
sinners, & was baptized
by his Precursour as one
of the multitude, and
more contemptible sort.
               4. Consider, how in
his last supper, girding
himselfe with a lynnen
cloth, and falling downe
vpon his knees before euery
one of his Apostls,
he washed their feet. At
the strangenes of which
fact, they were so astonished
and confounded,

as that S. Peter meruailing
at it more then the
rest, that the Sonne of
God abased himselfe so
farre, would not, that he
should wash his feet.
               5. Consider the humility,
that the King of
Glory declared in his
death, when he disdayned
not to be crucifyed
out of Hierusalem, in
the midst betweene two
theeues, in the feast of
the Pasche, whither the

people were come from
all partes in great number,
by reasō of the feast;
where he made a representation
of the shamefullnes
of his most ignominious
death to the view
of the whole world,
when as at another tyme
he made a manifestation
of some little part of his
glory to three of his discipls
alone in the desert;
neither yet, while he liued,
would speake any

word at al touching this
matter.
               
                  This Meditation being ended, you that
turne the eyes of your mind vpō your
selfe, and you shall stir vp these 
                        〈◊〉
                     
most profitable and practicall documents.
                  1. SInce that the K. of
heauē, & my Lord
hath humbled himselfe
so many waies, is it meet
that I the seruant, and a
most vile worme of the
earth, should extold my
selfe?
                  2. Neither ought I

to make outwardly any
more reckoning of
my selfe, then I am in
very deed.
                  3. Neither is it meet,
that for the conseruing
and entertaining of a
vaine reputation of my
name & credit, I should
abandon, or giue ouer
the care of my soule.
                  4. I must not in any
sort withdrawe my selfe
frō the exercise of those
thinges, which I haue

giuen ouer.
                  5. I ought not also to
conceale and keep hidden
those thinges, that
may serue for my mortification,
or to propose to
the view of all men those
thinges, that are wonte
to turne to my honour.
               
            
            
               MVNDAY.
               Of the Obedience of Christ.
               1. COnsider, what
the Apostle saith
of Christ: He was made
obediēt euen vnto death

yea to obey the precepts
of the law, wherunto he
was not bound at all; &
he refused no aduersityes,
torments, & ignominyes,
such as he suffered
in his circumcision,
and in his whole sacred
passion.
               2. Consider, how he
being the only Sonne of
God, and the wisedome
of the Eternall Father,
was most obedient to his
Mother, and to S. Ioseph

his reputed Father. And
though he were for infinite
causes more holy,
& more wise then they,
yet he neuer resisted against
that they commā
                  ded,
nor murmured against
them, nor censured
them, but with greatest
humility & promptitude
executed, and did
whatsoeuer they commanded
him.
               3. Consider the great
affection, wherwith our

Sauiour tēdred the vertue
of Obedience, for
which from the very
beginning he protested
to all, that he came into
the world not to do his
owne will, but the will
of his Father. And therfore
in another place he
called Obedience his
meate, and therby he signifyed,
that it was greatly
pleasing vnto him.
               4. Consider, how he
loued obedience, whiles

he not only considered
not the person of him
who commanded, nor
also the difficulty of the
thing commanded, but
was further obedient to
his enemyes, who tormented
him in his Passion,
and treated him
most ignominiously,
when they crowned him
with thornes. For being
willed to strip himselfe
of his garmentes, he delayed
not to doe it: willed

to sit downe, he obeyed:
when the crown
of thornes was put vpon
his head, he contradicted
not, and he tooke
the Reed in his hand,
that was giuen him for a
Scepter.
               5. Consider, how the
Lord of the Vniuerse obeyed
without any reply,
or further appeale;
in so much as he vsed
not the very least word,
& accepted of the most

vniust sentēce of death,
vniustly pronounced against
him by his peruerse
Iudges: and being
willed by the Ministers,
and officers to carry his
owne Crosse, he gladly
did it, and tooke it vpon
his bruized and torne
shoulders, and with it
vpon his necke, as another
obedient Isaac, he
went vp to mount Caluary,
there to be sacrificed
for our sinnes.
               
                  
                  The documents, that may be gathered
of this Meditation, be, that we omit
nothing defectiue against obedience.
                  1 SInce the Sonne of
God, without any
obligation at all, obeyed
with so great promptitude,
what shall be my
punishment, if I shall
not be obedient vnto
him, to whome I am
bound?
                  2. How grieuous shal
my sinne be, if I shall
peraduenture murmure

or rise against the commandmentes
of them,
who haue power ouer
me?
                  3. What excuse can
I pretend, if for the doing
of myne owne will,
I neglect the will and
pleasure of my Lord
God?
                  4. How great a shame
and confusion will it be
to me, if, that I may not
endure any aduersity, I
shall contemne to obey?
                  
                     
5. Who shall exempt
me from confusion,
and fault, if I shall iarre
and contend with him,
who is my Superiour, &
if, which is worse, I shal
censure that vniust
which is cōmanded me?
               
            
            
               TVESDAY.
               Of Christ his Patience.
               1. COnsider, how
Christ our lord,
from the very instant,
that he came into the

world, began to exercise
patience. For when there
was not any found in all
Bethleem, that would
receaue his Mother into
their house, he was forced
to make choice of a
poore Cot for the place
of his natiuity, where
the Manger serued for
his bed, & cradle to lye
in. Consider what manner
of intertainment he
had, when his Mother
was but a yong Virgin, a

poore stranger, and wearyed
by the payns of her
long iourney, in the midest
of winter, in a poore
stable, in the night tyme
and from home and out
of her countrey.
               2. Consider, how he
was no sooner borne, thē
that he was persecuted,
when he was forced to
flye into Aegypt because
Herod sought his life, &
to make him away Consider,
how many miseryes

& aduersityes, the
poore little child suffered
in so long and paynfull
a iourney, and in
Aepypt, a strange and
barbarous coūtrey, wher
he liued in a most poore
manner for some yeares
by the labours & paines
of S. Ioseph, & his poore
Mother.
               3. Consider the patience,
that the Iewes put
him vnto, when they often
called him a seducer

of the people, seditious,
a Magitian, & raiser vp
of Diuels, an enemy of
God, blasphemer, a preuaricatour,
& transgressour
of the Law, & gaue
out that he was a drinker
of wine: sometymes
in a fury they rose against
him, and had a
desire one tyme to stone
him, another tyme to
thrust him downe headlong
from the top of an
hill: but our meeke Iesus

is not recorded either to
haue reuenged himselfe
of so great iniuryes, or to
haue been incensed at al
against the ingratefull
people, but to haue studyed
to do them good euery
way.
               4. Consider, how patient
he was in al his dolourous
passion. When
he was layed hand on in
the garden, and carryed
away, as a thiefe bound
fast; was in the sight of

Annas censured for arrogant,
and receaued that
vnworthy buffet at the
hands of a most vile
bound-slaue: Caiphas
held him for a blasphemer,
and Herod for a
foole; and being treated
for such an one, he
endured all without any
perturbation of mind,
and with exceeding patience.
Consider the singular
acts of patience,
which our Sauiour exercised

in the house of Pilate,
where he was boūd
fast to a pillar, scourged
as some notorious malefactour,
scorned & mocked
in putting on the
crowne of thornes vpon
his head, grieuously payned
therewith, his diuin
face not only buffeted,
but also defiled with
most loathsome spittle;
and when he had much
a do to stand, they forced
him to carry his own

crosse, whereon he was
nailed, and did hang till
death. All this & much
more our Lord suffered
with so great patience, as
he complained not at al.
               
                  Of this Meditation you shall conceaue a
confusion and shame, for that you
haue suffered so little, or nothing at
all for our Lord, who hath suffered
so much, & so great matters for vs.
                  1. THov who seeest,
how much
thy Sauiour hath endured
for thee, say now,
who dost complayne so

much, what thou hast
suffered for him?
                  2. Thou hast not yet
from the first instant of
thy natiuity begun to
suffer.
                  3. Thou hast not yet
beene persecuted vnto
death, nor against all equity
and conscience.
                  4. Thou hast not byn
scourged, nor crowned
with thorns, nor nayled
to a crosse, nor so much
as shed one droppe of

bloud for thy Creatour.
                  5. What manner of patience
is thyne, when for
euery little aduersity, or
word, thou art troubled,
or fillest the ayre with
complaints?
               
            
            
               WEDNESDAY.
               Of Christ his Meeknes
               1. COnsider, how
the Scripture
sayd of Christ to the
Countrey of Iury: Loe
thy King commeth vnto

thee, meeke. For
where the worlds desert
was, that our lord shold
haue come downe from
heauen, armed with the
sword of Iustice, to take
vengeance on the iniquityes
of it, he descended
all benigne, and
gentle, that he might redresse
it, and giue a remedy
vnto it by meeknes,
and not chasten it
with the seuerity, and rigour
of his diuin iustice.
               
                  
2. Cōsider, how Christ
was most meek towards
his disciples, and gently
bare with their defects,
when they contented about
the primacy amōg
themselues: when they
were angry with Mary
Magdalen, at her annoynting
his head with
precious oyntment: whē
they forsook him, in the
garden, when-he was betrayed
into the Iewes
hands. For in these and

the like defects Christ,
out of his Gentlenes,
chose rather meekly and
benignly to blame them
the in a more seuere mā
                  ner,
to checke them by
shar
                     •
                   reprehension.
               3. Consider the meeknes,
that he vsed towards
the Scribes & Pharisies
his enemyes, who calū
                  niated
his workes, and
iniustly persecuted him,
affirming that he droue
out vncleane spirits in

the power of Beelzebub:
when he pardoned him,
his sins, who was troubled
with the palsey, and
that he blasphemed: &
that he had a diuell, whē
he reprehended them.
For our Lord by answering
with mildnes to
these & other their like
calumniatiōs, confounded
their ill meaning,
boldnes, and ouermuch
presumption.
               4. Consider further,

how our Lord discouered
his meeknes in the
presence of the Diuell.
For he permitted himselfe
to be tempted of
him, and though he best
knew the peruerse wil of
the bad and malignant
spirit, and might at the
first haue confounded
him, put him to silence,
and driuen him away;
yet he chose rather to ouercome
him with mild
answeres, and in that

manner to controle the
extreme boldnes of the
infernall friend.
               5. Consider the wonderfull
signes of meekenes,
that Christ vsed towards
Iudas, who betrayed
him. For though
he knew that he had sold
him for money, yet he
louingly admitted him
to his table, washed his
feete, and when the
houre was come, that he
deliuered him into the

handes of his enemyes,
he friendly imbraced
him, permitted him to
giue him a kisse, and by
calling him friend, in
a mild manner wished
him to remember himselfe,
and did put him
in mind of the sin, that
he then committed. Finally
like a meek lambe
he suffered himselfe to
be bound, and to be lead
whithersoeuer his Aduersaries
thought best.
               
                  
                  The fruit of this meditation shalbe to
vnderstand the defect and want of
meeknes, that lyeth hid in thee, and
to take paines for the gayning of it.
                  1. HOw farre thou
comest short of
thy meeke master Iesus,
who art not able to bear
with the very least defect
in thy Neighbours?
                  2. How little thy meekenes
is, who art angry
at euery least word, and
threatnest therfore.
                  3. What wouldst thou

now doe, if calumnyes
were raised against thee,
or that thou wert iustly
persecuted.
                  4. What wouldst thou
do, if thou wert sold, &
betrayed of him, who
had receaued singular
benefits at thy hands, as
Christ our lord was sold
and betrayed of his disciple
Iudas, vpon whom
he had cōferred so great
benefits?
               
            
            
               
               THVRSDAY.
               Of Christs contempt of the
world.
               1. COnsider, how
our Sauiour cō
                  temned
all those things,
that men of the world
desire and seeke after.
For first he contemned
the riches of this world,
and lead so poore a life,
as he would not haue
possessiō of any earthly
thing at all, but liuing
of almes, was contented

with those thinges, that
were necessary for his
state of pouerty, and for
cloathing.
               2. Consider, how he
despised al pleasures and
carnall delectations. For
the Iewes, who had treated
him ignominiously
many wayes, neuer durst
infame him touching
Chastity, which he so
plainely demonstrated
in his very face, as it induced
and moued euery

one, who beheld him,
to chastity, and purity
of life.
               3. Consider, how he
not only contemned the
honours & dignityes of
this world, but also, at
what tyme the Iewes
would once haue made
him King, he accepted
it not, but went away
from them, as from his
enemyes, declyning all
other titles & dignityes
whatsoeuer. And therefore

he prescribed vnto
his Apostles, that the
greater of them should
be the others seruant: &
therof he had giuen thē
an instance before, and
had giuen answere to Zebedeus
his sonnes, who
made petition vnto him
for an earthly dignity,
that they knew not what
they asked.
               4. Consider, how he
contemned the pleasurs
& contentments, which

worldly men so greedily
seeke after; and thereupon
some called him a
Carpenter, because he
assisted S. Ioseph in his
Carpenters trade: and
arriuing to 30. years of
age, he withdrew himself
into the desert, wher
he punished his most
innocēt flesh with very
soare pennance; and all
the remnant of his life
after, euer trauailed in
procuring the soules

health of his neighbors.
               5. Cōsider, how cheerfully
he imbraced the
things, which this blind
world conceaueth so
great an horrour of, and
flyeth from; that is, he
made no reckoning of
iniuryes, reproaches,
disgraces, tribulations:
contempt, and to be reputed
a foole; he neuer
sought to be reuenged,
as the world doth: and
when as by the very least

signe he might haue punished
his enemyes, he
would not doe it, but
with a great & generous
mind forgaue all them
who had offended him.
               
                  
                     
                        •
                     y this meditation you shall learne to
know your inward affections, for the
gouerning and moderating thereof,
as is most fitting.
                  1. HEnce you may
learne, whether
you follow the standard
of the World, or of
christ. For if you in hart

desire more, then is necessary,
or be carryed away
with carnall pleasures,
with an affection to
be honoured and esteemed
of men, & with the
vanityes of this life; a
signe it is, that in affection
you follow the world
though you make out-wardly
neuer so great
                        •
                     shew
to the contrary.
                  2. But if your care be
to please your Sauiour,
and to be like him, and

willingly imbrace tribu
                     
                        •
                     ations,
and loue to be
mocked & contemned;

                        •
                     t is a signe, that you are
a good souldier, and the
true disciple of Christ.
               
            
            
               FRIDAY.
               Of Christs Charity towards
his Neighbours.
               1. COnsider, how
the Sonne of
God, whereas he was in
Heauen adored of the
Angels, neither stood in

neeed of any thing, but
was most happy & blessed
in himselfe, pleased
to vndergoe the person
of a needy man, exposed
to a thousand aduersityes
and dangers, tha
                     •
                  
he might in this calamitous
banishment be ou
                     •
                  
maister & conductour
whereunto not his owne
profit, and vtility, bu
                     •
                  
his sincere and earnest
loue towards vs moued
him.
               
                  
2. Consider, how our
Sauiour thought it not
inough to haue take on
him mans nature for vs,
but also, whē he saw that
it was not within the cō
                  passe
of our weake abilityes
to satisfy the diuine
iustice for our faults &
transgressions, he layed
all vpon his own shoulders,
and abundantly satisfyed
for all mankind
And though his satisfaction
was superabundāt,

where one drop of bloud
had beene more then inough,
yet he shed all.
               3. Cōsider how, thogh
he foresaw there would
be many who would not
acknowledg this so great
a benefit, & would shew
thēselues vnworthy of so
great charity, he did not
for all that cease to loue
vs, nor loued vs the
lesse, neither reiected he
the ingratefull from being
capable of his benefits,

but as the inexhaust
Goodnes, as he was indeed,
most munificently,
& most liberally bestowed
himself vpon al.
               4. Consider the pains
trauailes, and troubles,
which Christ endured
for helping his Neighbours,
& you shall giue
a gesse at the greatnes of
his Charity For he trauayled
from one castle
to another on foot, and
from one Synagogue to

another, shewing vnto
all the way of saluation:
he neither feared, nor
regarded any aduersityes
at all, so he might
preach the kingdome of
heauē to the multitude.
And therfore among other
thinges, though he
were wearied of his iourney,
and it were very late
he yet cheerfully refused
meate, whereof he stood
in much need, that he
might conuert the Samaritan

woman.
               5. Consider the great
loue, which our Sauiour
shewed towards vs, whē
in the end he loued vs so
as he left himselfe vnto
vs in the most holy Sacrament
of the Altar.
Neither did he leaue vs
any lesser testimony of
his loue in his sacred
passiō, who to set vs free
from the bondage of the
Diuell, and the miseryes
of sin, endured the most

cruell tormentes that euer
were: and while he
hanged vpon the crosse,
prayed to his heauēly father
for his Crucifiers,
& excused them in these
wordes: Father forgiue
them, for they know not
what they doe.
               
                  Heere turne your eyes vpon your selfe,
and by comparing your selfe with
Christ, you shall stir vp your soule to
the loue of your neighbour, which is
the fruit of this Meditation.
                  1. VVILL you know
how great your

Charity towardes your
neyghbours is? Examin
it with that, which you
doe for them, and you
shal find it to be as great
as be the trauails, payns,
& incommodityes, that
you take & suffer in helping
them.
                  2. If thou dost good
neither to the soule, nor
body of thy neighbors,
neither hast wil to withdraw
the very least thing
from thy selfe for their

profit: and if what thou
doest, thou do it therefore
because it turneth
to thyne owne vtility,
what manner of Charity
is that of thine?
                  3. He that hath true
charity, wisheth spirituall
good to his neighbour,
as to himselfe,
prayeth to God for him,
assisteth him in his necessityes
as he is able, and
willingly forgiueth him,
wherein he hath offended

him.
               
            
            
               SATVRDAY.
               Of Christs diligence in spirituall
matters.
               1. COnsider, how
diligent our Sauiour
was in obseruatiō
of the law, no otherwise
thē if he had byn boūd.
For the eight day he was
circumcised, and the 40.
day he was presented in
the Temple; at euery
time of the yeare, as it

was appointed, he went
vp to Hierusalem, according
to the custome
to worship God there:
and he euer respected S.
Ioseph, and his Mother,
as the law commanded.
               2. Consider how, whē
he was to preach pennance
to others, he wold
first of al experience it in
himselfe. For after his
Baptisme, he retyred
into the desert, where
he gaue himselfe most

diligently, with fasting,
and punishing of his
owne body, to contemplation,
& to other spirituall
exercises.
               3. Consider how after
his returne from out of
the desert he begun to
preach, & with an amiable
diligence endeauoured
to shew the way
of saluation to all. To
the infirm he gaue doudle
health both of body,
and of spirit; he reproued

vice, he exhorted to
vertue: he went vp and
downe from place to
place, that he might
help many. To be short
that he might do good,
he spared no pains at al.
               4. Consider, how his
wil also was, that his disciples
should be diligent
in doing of good works.
For he oftē sent thē forth
to the adioyning castles
to preach, to cast forth
Diuells, to cure the sicke

and diseased, and therefore
he often exhorted
them to great Charity,
for he best of all knew,
that such diligence was
the mother, and beginning
of all spirituall
workes.
               5. Consider, how diligent,
and serious he was
in prayer; and when as
by day, by reason of his
ouermuch busines, wherwith
he was detayned in
preaching, and in the

conuersion of his neighbors,
he could not pray,
he attended to prayer
by night, and as S. Luke
sayth, he spent the night
in the prayer of God.
And this is also manifest,
for that, before
he began his passion, in
great humility and earnestnes
he addressed his
prayer thrice vnto his
heauenly Father; and in
the expiration of his life
he pleased to end it,

and to dye in praying;
namely, while he did
hang vpon the Crosse,
he prayed first for his
persecutours, and in saying:
Into thy hands, O
Lord, I commend my
spirit, he gaue vp his
Ghost.
               
                  The fruit, that is to be gathered of
this Meditation.
                  1. IF the Sonne of
God were so diligent,
not for any profit
that were to redound to

himselfe, why shouldst
not thou be confoūded,
who art so negligent in
matters of spirit, that
were prescribed for the
good of thy soule.
                  2. What will it help
thee, if thou be circumspect
in temporall
and transitory things, &
shalt be negligent in
prayer, mortification,
pennance, and other spirituall
functions?
                  3. Thou art also deceaued,

if thou be diligent
in thy particuler
deuotions, and slouthfull,
and drowsy in the
obseruation of the commandements
of God, &
of the Church.
                  4. If thou desire to
attaine to a diligence in
spiritual matters, endeauour
to loue them, for
that the more thou shalt
be affected vnto them,
the more diligent wilt
thou be inprocuring thē.
               
            
            
               
               ANNOTATIONS.
               FOR the due performing of
the former Meditations it is to
be vnderstood, that the Vertues of our
Sauiour may be meditated vpon, three
manner of wayes.
               1. First, that we may vnderstand
their nature and perfection, as the Philosophers
vse to contemplate the heauens
for the vnderstanding of their nature.
               2. Secondly, for the praysing, &
magnifying of him, who had so excellent
vertues. And this second manner
is both more noble, and more gratefull
to God; for that it hath a more excellent,
and a more perfect end, that is,
the praysing of Gods Godnes.
               3. Thirdly, for imitation, and
purchasing of thē: & this is the best mā
                  ner
of all, and more excellent then the
other two, and more pleasing to God.

For besides that, that it comprehendeth
the excellency of the two other, it hath
withall a most noble end, which maketh
a man like vnto the sonne of God.
And that is, the greatest perfection of
all, that a reasonable creature hath, or
can haue in this life.
               Moreouer in this manner be exercised
the three powers of the soule. The
Memory layeth before the eyes Christs
life, as the acts of vertue
                     •
                  , which he exercised,
whiles he liued. The Vnderstanding
discourseth about the vertues,
and the qualityes of then
                     •
                  . And the Wil
to the same vertues applyeth Affection
which helpeth to the attayning of those
vertues, for in that in which a thing is
loued, in that it is sought for to be attained.
               
                  The vtilityes of his last manner
be diuers.
               
               1. The first purgeth the soule from

vices. For while the vertues are planted,
the vices are destroyed in it.
               2. The second restoreth it to the
former beauty, and seemlynes, and directeth
it: for that by the vertues the
passions are brought backe againe to
their naturall order, that they doe no
more, then what they are swayed vnto
by reason.
               3. The third illuminateth: for
that the soule informed, and furnished
with vertues, and not troubled with
passions, both seeth, discerneth, & iudgeth
the better.
               4. The fourth maketh it gratefull
to the Creatour, and to all other
creatures, sith there is nothing, that
maketh a man so amiable, as doth vertue,
which draweth the very enemyes to
loue and admire it.
               5. The fifth enricheth it with
merits, for that all the vertuous acts of

him, who is in grace, be meritorious.
               And the way of reaping some fruit
in these Meditations, is this, that a man
put on an effectuall, and earnest desire
of attayning the said vertues, for from
this desire proceedeth the exercise therof,
which is the principall, and only
way to purchase them. Wherfore vpon
Sunday he, who meditateth of the humility
of Christ, must exercise many
acts of Humility. Vpon Munday,
he must exercise acts of Obedience,
and so of the rest. It is not euer necessary
to meditate vpon all the fiue points
of the Meditation, but it is inough to
insist vpon one, or two, and oftentymes
in the day to exercise the vertue, that be
hath meditated vpon, & to craue grace
of God to go forwardes therein, euery
day more and more.

            The Entertayning of good

            EVery day, morning,
and euening, for the
space of one Aue Maria,
or two, in a most serious
and affectuous manner,
thinke vpon that which
is set downe for euery
particuler day following:
and renew the same
good Thought euery

houre; which may easily
be done at all tymes, &
vpon euery occasion,
either sitting, walking,
working, lying &c. And
all people though neuer
so rude, may be made
capable thereof, to wit,
children, labourers, seruants;
yea, and that amidst
their imploymēts
& occupations, be they
neuer so great, or serious.

               O Repose! O glory euerlasting!
What is
it to enioy thee! And
what to be without thee!
            
            
               MVNDAY.
               The houre of death
will come! Then al will
be past! What would I
at that tyme wished to
haue done! Let vs now
do it. O my soule, let
vs now do it.
            
            
               TWESDAY.
               Ah poore soule! thou

must come to iudgment
all alone! Thy workes,
thy wordes, yea thy
thoughts, shalbe seene
of the Saints, of the Angells,
of God: and all
shal there be layd open!
Oh haue therfore a speciall
care of thy owne
good.

thee, from the bottome
of my hart, most detestable
sinne.
            
            
               FRIDAY.
               O sweet Iesus! To
thee I cōsecrate my life,
my desires, my soule.

For me wast thou nayled
on the Crosse. For
thee will I giue my selfe
and dedicate my selfe
wholy vnto thee.
            
            
               SATVRDAY.
               O blessed Virgin Mary!
How entirely didst
thou loue thy son Iesus!
O cause me to loue him,
& to serue him: & that
nothing in this world
may euer separate me
from his holy Grace.
            
         
         
            
            The beginning of the Ghospell,
according to S. Iohn.
            Glory be to thee, O Lord.
            IN the beginning was
the Word, and the
Word was with God, &
God was the Word.
This was in the beginning
with God. All
thinges were made by
him: and without him
was made nothing,

which was made. In him
was life, and the life was
the light of men: and
the light shineth in darkenesse,
and darknesse
did not comprehend it.
There was a man sent
from God, whose name
was Iohn. This mā came
for testimony, to giue
testimony of the light,
that all might belieue
through him. He was
not the light, but to giue
testimony of the light.

It was true light which
lightneth euery mā that
cōmeth into this world.
He was in the World,
& the World was made
by him, and the World
knew him not. He came
into his owne, and his
owne receaued him not.
But as many as receaued
him, he gaue them power
to be made the Sōnes
of God, to those that belieue
in his Name: who
not of bloud, nor of the

will of the flesh, nor of
the will of man, but of
God are borne. And the
Word was made flesh,
and dwelt in vs (and we
saw the glory of him,
glory as it were of the
only begotten of the Father)
full of grace and
verity.
            Thankes be to God.
