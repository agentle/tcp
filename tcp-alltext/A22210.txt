               ❧ A Proclamation concerning the viewing and distinguishing
of Tobacco in England and Ireland, the Dominion of VVales, and Towne of
Barwicke.
            
               WHereas diuers good and necessarie prouisions haue beene
heretofore made, aswell by Act of Parliament, as otherwise, for the well
garbling of Spices and Drugges, to the intent the Subiects of this Our Realme
should not bee occasioned to vse any vnwholsome Spices or Drugges, to the
impayring of their health▪ or to buy the bad instead of the good, to the
impairing of their substance. And for as much as the Drugge called Tobacco,
being of late yeeres growne frequent in this Our Realme & other Our
Dominions, is daily sold vngarbled, whereby more inconuenience groweth and
ariseth to Our louing Subiects, then by any other Drugge whatsoeuer. And for
that also by the manie and sundrie abuses practised and committed by
Merchants, Masters of Ships and others, in concealing and vttering the said
Tobacco without paying any Impost or Custome for the same, great losse and
dammage accrueth to Us, notwithstanding any Lawes, Statutes or other course
heretofore taken for preuenting thereof: For remedie of all which
Inconueniences, Wee, by our Letters Patents vnder our great Seale of England,
bearing Date, at Westmynster the fiue and twentieth day of May now last past,
did prohibite and forbid, That no person or persons should at any time after
the day of the Date of our said Letters patents within Our Realme of England,
the Dominion of Wales, and Port and Towne of Barwicke, or any of them; or
within Our Realme of Ireland, or any part of them or any of them, by himselfe
or themselues, or his or their seruants or factours, or any others, directly or
indirectly sell or put to sale; or attempt, presume or goe about any manner of
way to sell or put to sale, either in grosse or by retaile, any Tobacco, of
what sort, kind or growth soeuer, before the Custome and Impost thereof due,
were paid; and the same Tobacco were viewed, distinguished and sealed by the
Officer or Officers of Us, Our Heires and Successours, in that behalfe to be
constituted and appointed; For whose labour, trauell, charges and expences in
that behalfe to be sustained and taken in the execution of the said Office: Wee
did by the said Letters Patents, constitute and appoint, That they should and
might from time to time, demand, take and receiue to their owne vse, of euery
person and persons whose Tobacco they should so garble, viewe and seale, the
summe of foure pence of currant English money, for euery pound weight thereof
so viewed and sealed.
            And Wee did also by Our said Letters Patents (for the
considerations therein mentioned) giue and grant the said Office, with the
powers, fees and authorities before mentioned to Our welbeloued Subiects,
Francis Nichols, Iasper Leake and Philip Eden, Gentlemen, to
be executed by them or their Deputies or Assignes for thirtie and one yeeres
next ensuing the Date of the said Letters Patents.
            And Wee did further by Our said Letters, for Us, Our Heires and
Successours, giue and grant vnto the said Francis Nichols, Iasper
Leake and Philip Eden, and their Assignes, and to all and euery
person and persons, which by them or any of them, by writing vnder their or
any of their hands and Seales, should bee in that behalfe deputed and assigned,
full power and authoritie during the terme aforesaide, aswell to bee present
and to haue place in all manner of Custome-houses, Ports, Hauens, Creeks and
places of lading or vnlading of any manner of Goods, Wares or Merchandizes,
into or out of the said Realmes and Dominions: As also to be present with all
and euery the Customers, Collecters,  Searchers, Surueyers,
Waiters, and other Officers and Ministers hauing charge for or concerning the
lading or vnlading of any Goods, Wares or Merchandizes, for their better
executing of all and euery thing and things thereby appointed, and for their
better receiuing and enioying of the benefit of Our said Grant at all times and
places, where the said Officers and Ministers or any of them, should by reason
of their said seuerall Offices haue cause or occasion to be: And also in all
and euery place or places, aswell in Ships arriued with Tobacco, and riding in
any Port, Roade or Riuer, as on the Land, to make and appoint such and so many
Watchmen, Waiters and Officers, and to prouide and vse such reasonable waies,
orders and meanes, as they the said Francis Nichols, Iasper Leake and
Philip Eden, and their Assignes and Deputies should and might be iust
and truely informed of all parcels and quantities of Tobacco, as should at any
time or times during the said Grant, be brought into any Port or place, or be
planted or growing in any place or places of the said Realmes and Dominions or
any of them.
            And also that it should and might be lawfull, to and for the said
Francis Nichols, Iasper Leake, and Philip Eden, and their
Assignes, and their and euery of their Deputies and Substitutes, at all and
euery time and times during the terme aforesaid, in lawfull and conuenient
maner, with a Constable or other Officer of the place, aswell to goe on board,
view, and suruay all Shippes, Uessels, or Bottmes, riding or lying within any

saide Realme of England, Dominion of Wales, Port or Towne of Barwicke, or
Realme of Ireland, or any the members or places thereunto belonging, as to goe
into any House▪ Celler, Uault, Warehouse, Shop, or other place within the
said Realmes and Dominion, and Port, or Towne of Barwicke, or any part of them,
or any of them to search and view if there be any Tobacco vttered, sold, or put
to sale, or offered to be sold, or put to sale before the same be viewed,
distinguished, and sealed contrary to the true meaning of the said Letters
patents.
            And We did also by the said Letters for Us, Our Heires and
Successors, require, charge and Command all and singular Maiors, Shiriffes,
Iustices of Peace, Bailiffes, Constables, Headboroughes, Customers,
Comptrollers, Searchers, Surueyors, Waiters, and all other Officers, Ministers,
and Subiects whatsoeuer, of Us, Our Heires and Successors, aswell of the said
Realme of England, Dominion of Wales, and Port and Towne of Barwicke, as of
the said Realme of Ireland, That they and euery of them, should from time to
time during the continuance of that Our graunt, be aiding and assisting to the
said Francis Nichols, Iasper Leake, and Philip Eden, and
their Assignes, and to euery of them, their and euery of their Deputie and
Deputies, Substitute and Substitutes, in the due Execution of all and euery the
powers and authorities expressed in the said Letters Patents, vpon paine of the
displeasure of Us, Our Heires and Successors, and as they would answere the
contrary at their perils▪ as by the said Letters Patents more at large
appeareth.
            Wee now, to the intent Our will and pleasure in the premisses may
be the better knowne to all Our louing Subiects whom it may concerne, Doe
hereby notifie, publish and declare the same Our pleasure, willing and

               Giuen at Theobalds
