               MY very good coſyn, if I ſhould follow the fancies of ſome writters, who are accuſtomed in their dedycations, to glorifie the parties whome they haue choſen to be patrons of their workes, with manye ſtrained wordes and far ſought for phraſes, then in ſeeking to praiſe your beauty. I ſhoulde borrow colours for your cheekes, from lillyes and red roſes, for your lippes cheryes: & pearles, for your teeth, to figure foorth your chaſtyty, witt and many other graces, I muſt ſeeke out Diana, Pallas, the Muſes and diuers other helpes both deuine and pretious, and thus whilſt I might be curious in blaſing the perfections of your body, I ſhould vtterly forget the beauty of your ſoule. Let this then ſuffice, your beauty is not borrowed, and therefore without blemiſh; your body comly neither bumbaſt nor bolſtered, and therefore not holpen by arte, for the giftes and qualities of your mind as they are many, ſo they are ſuch as may wel bee ſaid to bee both vertuous and godly: and nowe affyenge my ſelfe in your courtious acceptaunce, I haue made bould to preſent you with this hiſtorye, The aduentures of Bruſanus▪

            The aduentures of Bruſanus Prince of Hungaria, pleaſant for all to read and profitable for ſome to follow, written by Barnaby Riche ſeuen or eight yeares ſithens, and now publiſhed by the great intreaty of diuers of his friends.
            
               The firſt Chapter.
               
                  Myletto King of Hungaria had a ſonne and a daughter, the ſonne called Bruſanus the daughter Leonida.
               
               
                  AT that time when the moſt renowned
Liberius gouerned the empire of Conſtantinople holding the parts of Cayre Soria, Calypha, and all Grecia in the moſt chriſtian & catholicke faith, at that very inſtant ther raigned likewiſe in
Hungaria ye noble king Myletto a prince of ſuch iuſtice as he neuer thought him ſelfe priuiledged in being a prince, nor did meaſure greatnes by any thing but by goodnes. This prince was ſo fauoured and foſtered vp by fortune, his eſtate ſo eſtabliſhed with honour, ſo beautified with wealth, ſo deckt with the diademe of dignitie, and ſo indued with fortunate proſperity, that he 
                     ••
                  med to want nothing which either fortune or the fates might aforde him, ſo that he was honoured with the ſacred titles of good, iuſt, merciful, with many other like vertuous additions: But as the vices of children are ſwords which paſſe through ye harts of their parents, ſo the happines of Myletto was greatly ſurcharged with this heauines, for hauing to wife a lady called Paulina, by byrth royall, by nature faire, by education learned, & by vertue
 mous, by this lady Myletto in the prime of his yeares had two children, the one a ſonne called Bruſanus, the other a daughter named Leonida▪
                   ſo perfect in complextion, ſo pure in conſtitution, ſo adorned with outward beuty, and ſo indued with inward bounty, as her very countenaunce was full of baſhfulneſſe, loue and reuerence. Bruſanus on the other ſide, was ſo contrarie to his ſiſter (though not in ſtate of body, yet in the ſtay of his minde) as it made al men maruell how two ſo contrary ſtems could ſpring of a ſelfe ſame ſtocke, yet his parſonage was moſt comelie, euery lineament gallantly proportioned, his face and countenance ſweet and amiable, with an intiſing louelines to as many as did behold it: But in the quality of his minde, hee was ſo ſpotted with voluptuouſneſſe ſo nuſled in wantonnes, ſo giuen ouer to licentiouſneſſe, ſo linked to wilfulneſſe, and ſo caried away with all kind of wickedneſſe, that neither the feare of god, the diſpleaſure of his parents, the ſundry admonitions of his carefull and louing friendes, nor the regard of his owne honor could make him deſiſte, or driue him from this deteſtable kind of life: the day he conſumed in ſuch ryot, exceſſe, dronkeneſſe, dicing, gaming, ſwearing & ſwaſhing, as whole millions of gold, were inſufficient to maintaine the expences of ſo witles prodigality: the night he ſpent in maſking, mūming, dauncing, banqueting and hooring: do you thinke then there wanted ruffians, royſters, flaterers, brokers, bawdes, and ſuch other like to follow him? O no be ſure there wil be to many counterfaites to imitate the naturall vice of princes but the good king his father hauing many times waſted his wind in fruitles exhortations to his ſonne, being ſtill gauled with this continuall griefe, fearing that after his death, his ſonnes laſcyuious life would be the ouerthrow of his houſe, the conſumer of the kingdome, the wracke of the common weale, and the very man that ſhould bring the ſtate to miſcheife and miſerie, determined eyther to cut of the courſe of his liuing or of his life, thinking it better to want a ſonne, then neuer to want ſorrow, hauing ſoe gratious a daughter to whome he might leaue the inheritance of his crowne, in whoſe iſſue the kingdome might bee made more happye: but firſte determined to ſeeke all other poſſible meanes. He cauſed his ſonne to be ſent for, to whom he ſaid as foloweth.
            
            
               
               The ſecond Chapter.
               
                  The fatherlie exhortation of Myletto to Bruſanus.
               
               CAlling to mind (Bruſanus) firſt the royall race frō whence thou art deſcended, the vertuous education wherein thou haſt beene nurtered, the ſundry holſome preceptes where with thou haſt beene inſtructed: with the lewed and ſhamles demeanure wherein thou art daily nuſled, as I can but lament thy miſfortune, ſo I muſt more wonder at thy follye, and yet the more I thinke, the more cauſe I haue of thinking & the leſſe hope of thy amendment. Haue thy friendes hoped ſo long for a plentiful harueſt, & now ſhalbe conſtrained to gather weedes, haſt thou from thy youth béene trained vp in learning, and after thou haſt giuen a good ſoape to the payle, thou ſhouldeſt kicke it downe curſtly with thy heels, O how much better had it beene for thee neuer to haue rypened, then ſo ſoone to haue rotted: thou ſeeſt (Bruſanus) my white heaires are bloſſomes for the graue, and thy freſh coulour, fruit for time and fortune, ſo that it behoueth me to think how to dy, & for thée to care how to liue: my crowne I muſt leaue by death, and thou enioy my kingdome by ſucceſſion: it is then requiſite for thee ſo to fortifie thy minde with ſtrong reaſons, graue ſentences, and learned preceptes of wiſdome, that thy weake ſéedes of vertue be not drowned in the floudes of vaine delights: For as the prince being the head of his people, and moſt excelent of all: hee muſte therfore by his good example be a paterne to al. What honor is it for a prince, to go farre beyonde the common ſorte in pretious ſtones, beaten gold, coulloured ſilcks, and great traines of ſeruantes, when he ſhall be inferiour to all in vertues and honeſty of life: For to inſtructe his people by precepts, is a longe and difficult way, but to teach them by example, is very ſhorte, and of greater efficacy, for where they ſhall ſée vertue after a liuelie ſorte imprinted in a viſible paterne, and that the princes life is ſuche an example, they become wiſe of their one accord, then is force, conſtraint or threatning, néedleſſe to bring them to their dutie: O conſider my ſonne the difference betwéen a vertuous king and a vitious prince, the one ſtriueth to
 inrich his ſubiectes, the other to deſtroy them, the one ſpareth the honor of good women, the other triumpheth in their ſhame: the one taketh pleaſure to be freely admoniſhed, the other miſliketh nothing ſo much as wiſe and vertuous councell: the one maketh great acompt of the loue of his people, the other is better pleaſed with their feare: the one is neuer in doubt of his owne ſubiectes, the other ſtandeth in awe of none more then them: the one burdeneth them but as litle as may be vpon publique neceſſitie, the other gnaweth the fleſh from their bones to ſatisfie his vaine pleaſures, the one in time of warre hath no recourſe but to his ſubiectes, the other kéepeth warre but only with his ſubiects: the one is honored in the time of his life and mourned for after his death: the other is hated in his life with perpetuall infamie after his deathe: A crewell prince will make a ſlaughter houſe of his common wealth, a hooremaiſter will make it a ſtewes, a prodigall will ſucke the marowe of his ſubiectes, to glut ſome halfe doſine flattering parriſites, that wil be about his parſon, diſguiſed in the habit of fidelity: A good prince muſt not dedicate the common wealth to him ſelfe, but muſt addicte him ſelfe to the common wealth, and becauſe no man aſketh accompt of him in his life, hee ought to be ſo much the more ſtirred vp to demand a ſtreighter rekoning of him ſelfe: bee muſt liue as it were vppon an open Theatre where he is ſéene on euery ſide, ſo that his life will be a diſcipline and inſtruction of good or ill liuing vnto others, therefore let him ſeeke to excell thoſe whome he ruleth and to ſurmount them as farre in vertue, as hee ſurpaſſeth them in riches and honour. But what is to be hoped for from that prince, that only accompanieth him ſelfe with curteſans, flatterers, drunckards, diceplaiers, dauncers and inuenters of pleaſures, breiflie in the midſt of ſuch caytiffes amongſt whome he learneth nothing but pleaſure, delight, pride, vanitie and ſuch other. Why ſhouldeſt thou make ſuch accompt of the beautie of thy bodye, which hauing incloſed in it the ſoule which is defiled with ougly vice & monſterous ſinne, is nothing els but a proud ſepulcher vnder which is contained a ſtinking and putrified carrion: Forſake ſuch vaine delightes (Bruſanus) and let vertue be thy guide if thou wilt attaine to happye honour. For
 For honor is the onely reward of vertue▪ and onely vertue muſt open the gates of honour.
               The Romanes builded two temples ioyned to gether, the one being dedicate to vertue the other to honor: but yet in ſuch ſorte, as no man could enter into that of honor, except hee firſt paſſed through that of vertue, which is the onely thing whereof al the greatnes, glory and honour of men dependeth, and not in the dignitie wherein they are placed: A ſmall want to bragge of the ſcutchyons and armes of our aunceſtors, when (to ſpeake trulie) there is no righte nobillitie but that which ſpringeth of vertue: He boaſteth in vaine of his great linage, that ſeeketh to be eſteamed for the nobillitie and vertue of his anceſtors, and hath no goodnes in him ſelfe: for what is it to vaunt of Hercules race, and not to follow his workes, which made him ſo famous through ye world: Deſpiſe not my ſonne thy fathers louing admonitions, for (as the wiſe man ſaieth) he that honoreth his father ſhall haue ioy of his owne children, and when hee maketh his praier he ſhall be hard: he that feareth the lord honoureth his parents, and doth ſeruice to his parents as to the lord: The bleſſings of the fathers eſtabliſh the houſes of the children, and the mothers curſſe rooteth out the foundations: He that forſaketh his father ſhall come to ſhame, and he that angreth his mother is curſed of god: To conclude, there is no praier which god heareth more willingly then that of the father, which hee maketh for his child: O my ſonne while thou haſt yet time, apply thy ſelfe to that now in thy youthe, which will be profitable for thee in thy olde age, namely to the attaining of vertue and knowledge, which will procure vnto thée, honour, praiſe, ſafetie, happines, reſt and tranquilitie in this life, and will in the end guide thee to eternall life.
            
            
               Chapter third.
               
                  The demeanure of Bruſanns after his fathers exhortations, and how he was handeled by Petrona a curtizane.
               
               THe carefull old father, hauing diſcourſed thus far to his careleſſe yoong ſonne, was here interrupted with the abundance of teares which ſtreamed downe his cheekes, but
Bruſanus who that very morning had appointed with certaine
 of his companions, to meete in the Citie at a curtezans houſe, where great reuell was appointed for, was all this while ſo buſyed in the contemplation of his pleaſures, that hee vnderſtood neuer a worde what his father had deliuered, and was therfore able to make him no manner of anſwere, but ſeeking his beſt oportunity to giue his father yt ſlip, in the end, conuaid himſelfe away to his appointed place, where he found his companions attending his comming: The father wounderfully perplexed at his ſonnes demeanure, had the narrower watch to the reſt of his proſeedinges, and finding his courſe of life rather to waxe worſe then any whit to better, reſolued himſelfe of this laſt experyment, which was to cut him from all manner of meanes whereby to maintaine his lauiſh expences, and not only by ſhutting vppe his owne purſe, but alſo by ſtraight proclamation through his whole kingdome, he prohibyted all vnder great penaltie, neither to lend him mony, nor to render vnto him any manner of reliefe. But could there be a greater griefe to Bruſanus then ſo ſodainly to be brought to ſo extreame want, his father would affoord him no manner of allowance, the reſt were reſtrained by the late proclamation, hys companions that hitherto had followed him in all his follyes, that were the very miniſters of all his miſchiefes, amongſt whome he had conſumed whole millions of treaſure, and many of them made rich by his idle expences, did not onely refuſe to helpe him in this neceſſity, but alſo lefte him alone, and refuſed to come in his company. Bruſanus being nowe driuen to hys laſt refuge: calling to his rememberance an old acquaintance, called by the name of Madona petrona, a curtyzane that him ſelf had aduaunced from baſe parentage, who by his prodigalitye was wonderfully inriched, both in apparell, Iewelles, and great ſtore of money which ſhe put out to vſurye, thinking to find her as kind of her coine as ſhe was of her honeſty, he imparted vnto her the extreamitye of his want, but ſhee hauing had former inteligence how matters had paſſed betweene hys father and him, and finding him now to bee growne ſo bare, determined to ſhake handes with his acquaintaunce, and notwithſtanding the many benefites which before he had beſtowed of her, ſhe rather reſolued to ſée him begge, then ſhee would
 part with one crowne to doe him pleaſure, but yet for her better excuſe ſhe anſwers him thus: Thrée yeares are fully expired
(my Lord Bruſanus) ſince you tooke the firſt frutes of my body, ſith which time I haue remained altogether at your diſpoſition, ſo often as it pleaſed your ſelfe to commaund, yet not without great infamye and ſlaunder to my perſon, beeing diſcredited through the whole Citie, by your continuall recourſe and repayre to my houſe, and although I muſt confeſſe you haue beſtowed of me many liberall rewardes, and from time to time haue gratified me with rich and coſtly preſentes, yet ſir when you ſhall conſider well of your peny worthes, I haue greateſt cauſe to complaine of my market, when the bargaine hath coſt me the price of my maidenhead, my payne of pleaſaunt yeares ſpent at your deuotion, with my name and reputation for euer infamed: where otherwiſe my beautie might haue proued a bayte to haue intangeled ſome amorous gentleman or other rich marchant, that might haue maintained me and made mée his wife, where nowe that hope were more then vaine to looke for: what reſteth then for poore Petrona but to hold that ſhee hath, and to make account of no more, then what ſhe doth allready poſſeſſe. Bruſanus, who all this while had liſtened to hee ſpeaches, was not a little pinched to heare her concluſion, but minding to make no other replye, imbraſing her in his armes he gaue her a frendly buſſe, adding theſe fewe words as followeth: I perceiue my Petrona, the old prouerbe muſt be newly veryfied, which ſaith, that pouertie will part good company, thou knoweſt I haue loued thée, and now I muſt leaue thée, but if thou thinkeſt I haue bought thy chaffer to cheape, blame but my fortune, which hath rather conducted me to craue new credite, then to paye old debts: with this hee gaue her an other frendly kiſſe, making ſemblaunce as though he would haue taken his leaue, thinking that for a farewell Petrona at the leaſt would haue relieued him with ſome fiue hundered crownes, who had beſtowed of her (at ſeuerall times) a great manye thouſandes, but ſhee more lauiſhe of her lippes, then ſhee was of her purſe, to ſhift him off by a prettyer meane replied in this manner. Alas Bruſanus and muſt wee needes part, if (as you ſay) there bee no other remedy, knowe this by
 the way, Petrona cannot liue by kiſſes, but if you loue me as you haue proteſted in wordes, I hope I ſhall finde it confirmed in your deeds, and being fitted nowe by occation to make triall of your kindneſſe, I ſtand in want at this inſtant of a thouſande crownes, the which (my Bruſanus) I hope you will not denye me for a farewell, being the laſt gifte (as I perceiue by your owne wordes) that I am euer like to receiue at your handes.
               
                  Bruſanus finding himſelfe to bee thus preuented, anſwered thus: Petrona, thy former experience (I thinke) hath taught thee, that my crownes haue been euer at thy commaundement, my ſwoord as ready to incounter thine enimies, my body as willing to ſatisfie thy pleaſures, nay wherein haue I failed to fullfill all duties proper to a louer, but Petrona the world is chaunged with Bruſanus, haſt thou not hard, my father is diſpleaſed with me, doſt thou not know my frendes haue forſaken me, and doſt thou not ſee my ſeruantes haue lefte me, Bruſanus hath beene honoured as a prince, but now more diſpiſed then a poore peſaunt, what ſpeakeſt thou of a thouſand crownes (Petrona) to him that is not furniſhed of ſo many farthinges: yet the thing that doth moſt greue me, is to part with thy ſweete company, but there is no remydye. Bruſanus may not ſtay,
Hungaria cannot hold him. Alas my Lord (ſaid Petrona) and can you beſtow nothing for a farewell, if you bee driuen to ſo narrowe a ſcantling, the paringes of your nay.es ſhall ſuffyce to content your louer petrona, the which as a relique in your rememberaunce, I would charily keepe, perſwading my ſelfe that if you had had a better preſent, I know it would haue falne to my ſhare. Bruſanus ſeing the kindnes of the louing worme, cutting of the paringes of his nayles he deliuered them into her hand, vttring theſe wordes: Loe petrona, to ſatisfy thy requeſt, hold heere the preſent, which I know thou haſt deſyred for the loue thou beareſt vnto me, and although for thy ſake I could hartely wiſhe them▪ to bee Iewelles of ineſtimable price, yet knowing ſuch wiſhes are euer but waſt, I aſſure thée if my ability would ſtretch aswell to a whole million of gold, I would as willingly beſtowe the one as I haue reddely giuen the other: And heere withall preſſinge towardes her, thinking once a gaine to haue taken a kindly kiſſe, ſhe thruſt him from her and
 ſaid: Nay ſofte Bruſanus you miſtake your texte, I am ſure euery pariſh prieſt could learne you this leſſon, No penny no pater noſter, and I haue often hard it ſaid, No lenger piping no lenger daunſing, and nowe thou haſt nothing lefte, what ſhould I doe with thy company, goe vaunt thée now Bruſanus, thy louer petrona would neuer leaue thée, ſo long as thou hadeſt but the paringes of thy nayles left to beſtow of her, the beſt aduiſe I can nowe affoord thée is, I would with thée preſently to goe hang thy ſelfe, by meanes whereof both thy ill fortune and thyne ill life might both finiſh in an ill death: This ſaid ſhe ſpeedely flung away from him, goeing into her chamber, where ſhe ſhut faſt the dore, leauing Bruſanus ſtanding all alone, who recounting with himſelfe of theſe diſpightfull taunts, had his fantaſie ſo aſſailed with feare, griefe, diſpaire, heate, coller, wrath, and deſire of reuenge, that he raged againſt the gods, he railed on the deſtinies, he defied loue, hee curſed all woman kind: and hauing thus giuen allarume as well to all the powers of heauen as alſo to all the workes of the earth, after a little pauſe and that he had a while bitte on the bridell, he returned into theſe ſpeaches.
            
            
               The fourth Chapter.
               
                  How Bruſanus ſorrowing his former miſled life, reſolueth to trauaile.
               
               ANd wilt thou now be diſcouraged Brunſaus, by remembring thine owne imperfections, ſeeing by labour and diligence thou maieſt yet recouer what thou haſt hitherto loſt, haſt thou ſeene ſo much and canſt thou practiſe nothing, are thine eies cleare, and wilt thou ſtill counterfeit blindnes, haſt thou thy right fences and wilt thou ſeeme ſenceleſſe, canſt thou not make profite of thine owne folly, learne with the bée to gather ſweeteſt honny from the bittereſt hearbes, when both fortune, ocaſion, and thine owne induſtry maye ſo well helpe forward the matter, let thy vice make thy vertue more to ſhine, ſo maiſt thou thinke thy pouerty a happy proſperity, yea moſt happy maiſt thou count thy miſhap, that is the originall of thy true
 hap, while thou dideſt flouriſh, how wert thou fed with faire wordes, how many fained frendes, fine fauners and cunning flatterers did haunt thée, yea in thy wealth whole millions of frendes did compaſſe thée, but now in thy want, doeſt thou not ſee that both pleaſure and company doth forſake thée, thou canſt not find one that will affoord thee ſo much as a good looke. Sith then Bruſanus, thou findeſt ſuch falſhoode in felloweſhip, and ſuch faithleſſe deeds in ſuch painted ſpeches, ſhake of theſe fauning curres with the flagge of defiance, and from henceforth trie ere thou truſt: I but now to late to apply a plaiſter when the ſore is paſt cure, to cry Alarume when the Citie is ſackt, to ſeeke for couert, when the ſtorme is paſt, and now thou wilt cry cauy, when thy coine is conſumed, and beware of flatterers when thy wealth is wracked, to waxe more chary when thou haſt nothing in thy charge, and when thou haſt allready receiued the maate, thou ſeekeſt by cunninge to make voide the checke: But now thou trieſt it true that thy father foretould thée, that ſo long thou wouldeſt be careleſſe, that at the laſt repentance would pull thée by the ſleeue: but the flattering pleaſures of this world can promiſe no other bliſſe, for worldly proſperity
(I ſée) is a ſpur to wickednes, it carrieth men willingly to the pleaſant court of vanity. Leaue of therefore Bruſanus if not for ſhame yet to avoid ſinne: ſhake of this incumbraunce, ſtriue to be verteous, leaue to be amorous, forſake misdemeanure, and ſince thou haſt ſeene much, practiſe a little: it is a common imperfection to offend, but an extraordinary perfection to amend, the firſt ſpringeth by nature, the other from vertue, & how often hath thy father told thée that honor is only to be ſought for by the meanes of vertue. It onely reſteth then that I imbrace thee (o ſweete repentance) by whoſe onely meanes, we are drawne to mercie, and without whoſe winges we cannot flye from vengance. Bruſanus thus thanked the Godes, that had wrought his honour out of his ſhame, that had made his owne finding to goe amiſe, to be the beſt meane euer after to hold him in the right pathes, and although before hee had ſhewed himſelfe a braue gallante in the court of Venus, yet nowe he vowed himſelfe a profeſſed ſouldiour to march vnder the enſigne of vertue, and calling to mind his former miſlede
 life, did not onely deteſt and hate loue, but ſo mightely contemned the whole feminine ſex, that his hatred did ſo much exceed, by howe much hee remembred his preſent misfortunes. This was a ſodain chaunge, but ſure a happy chaunce, but
Bruſanus holding on a determinate minde to ſeeke after honor, reſolued him ſelfe to trauell, the which when his father had got intelligence of the newes, was halfe a ſalue to his ſorrowe, thinking that it woulde either bee a meane to end his life or mende his lewdnes, he therefore tooke ſecret order to haue him conueniently furniſhed as well with mony as all manner of other neceſſaries.
            
            
               The fifth Chapter.
               
                  Bruſanus iourneing through the country of Epirus, mett with Leonarchus king of that Region, diſguiſed like a merchant, called himſelfe Corynus, and what ſpeaches paſſed betweene them.
               
               
                  BRuſanus being thus appointed, called to his remembrance the order of many trauellers, who after their returne into their owne countrey are commonly ſo full fraught, with farre fette follies, that they are vtterly emptie of their home vertues, and can make no better returne then their heades ouerburthened with too many outlandiſhe vanities, he therefore armed him ſelfe with a determinate minde, to gather a platforme both of vertue & vice, imitating the good in their commendable qualities, & abhorring the bad in their fooliſh demeanures applyeng both preſydents of good and bad to one vertuous purpoſe, & wholy to endeuor him ſelfe in al honorable enterpriſes hauing thus fortified him ſelfe with this vertuous imagination, directed his firſt courſe towards Epirus, wher Leonarchus then reigned kinge, a prince that was renowned for his vertue, fortunate for his peaceable gouernment, reuerenced for his grauity, obayed for his authoritie, loued for his mediocrity, and honored for his liberalitie, adminiſtring iuſtice with ſuch ſinceritie, yet tempering the extreamitie of the lawe with ſuch limmite, as he gained the good wil of ſtrangers in hearing his
 vertue, and wonne the heartes of his ſubiectes in feeling his bountie, counting him vnworthy to beare the name of a ſoueraigne which knew not (according to deſerte) both to cheriſhe and chaſtice his ſubiectes. This noble prince vpon a priuate conceipt to him ſelfe, diſguiſed in the habite of a marchant, had ſecretly left his courte, and trauelling through many partes of his owne dominions (being not other-wiſe taken then for a marchant) called him ſelfe by the name of Corynus, the which name (becauſe I perceiue hee was other wiſe loath to bee knowne) I will therefore vſe for the time. Bruſanus, who in the meane ſpace had iurnied many daies towards Epirus was now come to the confines, and taking his directe courſe towards the famous citie of Doretta (where the court was ſtill reſidente) he fortuned (in the way) to ouer-take this kinglye marchante Corynus: and after friendly ſalutations paſſed betweene them, Corynus taking a through vewe of this gallant yonge prince, was wonderfully delighted in his comely perſonage, in his amiable countenance, and in his modeſt regards: and perceiuing by his apparell that hee was a ſtranger, to breake of their vnneceſſarie ſilence he ſaide. Although (curteous gentleman) it bee no parte of good manners to deſire to knowe a ſtrangers ſecrets, yet if it pleaſed you but to recompt vnto me what country man you are borne, whether you are trauelling, and what I might call your name, if (to requite your curtiſie) ther be any thing wherein I may ſtead you, you ſhall command me for a much greater matter then I haue yet requeſted. Bruſanus hauinge heard the mild motion of this graue marchaunte whoſe outward ſhew of countenance, did manifeſt an inward ſtay of minde aunſwered thus? Sir, my country is Hungaria, my name Bruſanus, by byrthe a gentleman, by fortune a traueller, and the cauſe ſtanding of ſuch nice poyntes, as peraduenture your grauity may hardly brooke: let this ſuffice, my yonge yeares (as you ſée) ſubiecte to ſundry impreſſions, at the laſt haue taken holdfaſt in trauelling to vnknowne citties, led by this reſolution, that in ſéeing manye thinges, I ſhould learne ſome thing, and intiſed by the generall reporte of the rare vertues, the maieſticall gouernmente, and moſt renowned demeanure of Leonarchus, who holdeth
 her the princely diademe, I haue left myne owne country, and am trauelling to his court to ſe if the brauery be correſpondent to the brute, and the demeanure of the countries, ſo commendable as is reported. Corynus, ſecretly reioyſing to heare himſelfe ſo praiſed, aunſwered thus. Truly, (curtious gentleman) the commendations you haue giuen to Leonarchus are ſo many, that my ſelfe (being as much affected towards him as any ſubiecte may bee to his ſoueraigne) canne deuiſe to ſay no more, and for that by your former ſpéeches, I perceiue your deſire is to grow into the highe way of experience, being arriued heer to ſe the faſſions of our court, whatſoeuer by eie your ſelfe ſhall perceiue, I by my experience can ſomething lay open, hauing in my yoonger daies ventured amongſt the reſt to become a courtier, although not ſo formall as county Baldaſſare hath figured. The court here of Epirus, being ſo renowned (as you would make it) by the king that now holdeth the ſcepter, as it is repleniſhed with men of diuerſe calling, ſo it is frequented by men of as ſundry diſpoſitions. Some repaire thither hoping of preferment by their vertuous indeuors, who by their good deſeruinges are to growe in fauour, or by their valor and force of armes, are to be confirmed with martiall honour. Other againe incited by vanitie (hauing the raine in their one neckes) reſort thither to ſatisfie their youthfull humors with a little foliſh brauery, where their braines are ſo continually combred with deuiſing of new faſhions, that many times of comly perſonages, they transforme them ſelues to diſguiſed puppittes. By this you may perceiue that as the court is a ſchoole of vertue to ſuch as can bridell their mindes with diſcretion, ſo it is a nurſſe of vice to ſuche as meaſure their wils with witleſſe affection.

                  How Bruſanus and this counterfaite Marchant were incountered by a courtier called Glorioſus, and lodged at Vtica.
               
               
                  COrynus had not ſcare ended theſe ſpeaches, but they were ouertaken by a Gentleman that was ridinge to the
 court, and a courtier hee was, called by the name of Signior Glorioſus, the loftines of his lookes was much to bee marueld at, but the manner of his attire was more to bee laughed at. On his head he woare a hatte without a band like a Mallcontent, his haire hanging downe to both his ſhoulders, as they vſe to figure a hagge of hell, his beard cut peecke a deuaunt, turnde vppe a little, like the vice of a playe, his countenance ſtrained as far as it would ſtretch, like a great Monarcho: his coller turnde downe round about his necke that his throat might be ſéene, as one that were going to hanging ſhould make way for the hallter, his dublet holſtered with bumbaſt, as if he had béene diſeaſed with the dropſie: vppon that hee wore a looſe Mandilyon, like a counterfeit ſouldiour, in his hand a fanne of fethers, like a demye harlot: Riding thus along by them, caſting his eies to and fro, ſeming by his demenure, as if he had had, a whole common wealth in his head, without any word ſpeaking, Corynus who before had knowne him in the court, and therefore beſt aquainted with his humor, ſaid vnto him: Gentleman, if I bee not much mistaken you are riding towardes the court, whither (if it pleaſe you) wee will be glad to beare you company: Glorioſus bending his browe anſwered: thou baſe borne fellowe, what doeſt thou thinke I would make a companion of thee, a pedling marchant, more fit for a ware houſe then a princes court: Corynus ſmiling to himſelfe to heare the folly of this vaine headed courtier mildly made anſwere: Truly ſir, I would not preſume ſo far to make my ſelfe your companion, but I haue knowne right worſhipfull Gentle men thus riding by the way, that would haue bene wel pleaſed with good company: This ſofte replye wonderfully qualified the fyerſe nature of Glorioſus: whoſe colericke complection was as teſty as a gooſe that hath yong goſlinges, yet eaſy to be pleaſed againe with a handfull of otes, ſo after a little more frendly communication had betweene them, they were come to the gallant Citie of Vtica, where they all agreed to teſt for that night, and after they were come to the inne, Bruſanus deſirous to goe viſit the monuments of the Citie, and to take a view of the brauery of the buildings, was accompanied by Corynus, Glorioſus keping his lodging as one diſdaining to walk
 the ſtreets with ſo ſimple company: but after they had walked themſelues wery, and were returned againe to their chamber,
Corynus demaunding of a ſeruant what other ſtrangers were in the houſe, was anſwered there were two other, the one a ſouldiour, called by the name of Martianus, who was newly come from the court, the other called Caſtus, a countrey man that was trauelling towardes the court: Corynus willed the ſeruant to intreate them both to come vp, hoping to heare ſome newes, eſpecially by Martianus, who was come from the court, the which both himſelfe and the reſt deſired.
            
            
               The ſeauenth Chapter.
               
                  What newes Martianus brought from the court, how the king was miſſing, and how the courtiers did generally bewaile his loſſe.
               
               BEing both come vp into the chamber, after they had béene very frendly wellcomed, Corynus turning to Martianus ſaid, as we vnderſtand you are lately come from the court, and we being deſirous to heare what noueltyes are newe coined, are to craue ſo much curteſy at your handes, to make vs partakers of your newes, and for myne owne part, I ſhall thinke my ſelfe greatly pleaſured, that am accuſtomed by ſuch particuler platformes, to gather an vniuerſal: cogniſeance either of good or bad: Martianus curtiouſlye aunſwereed: Truelye Gentlemen the newes at the courte are ſtraunge, yet not ſo ſtraunge as true, yet not more true then generally lamented by as many as ouer heareth them: Twentye daies are nowe fully expired, ſith our moſt vertuous and noble prince Leonarchus hath beene miſſed at the courte, no man knoweing what ſhould become of him, neither can it be immagined whether he be dead or aliue, gone he is, ſearch there hath beene, inquiry is daily made euery way, and by all meanes, but no tidinges can be learned more then I haue told you. The lamentable clamours are vniuerſall, the graue counſailers ſheades their teares for the loſſe of their prince, the father of their counſelers, the very ſtay and principall piller of all their conſultations,
 the gallant courtiers haue lefte off their coſtly colours, betaking themſelues to mourning hewe, hanging their heades, wringing their handes, lamenting the lacke of him that was a prince to defend them, a father to care for them, a companyon in their pleaſures, a frend to reliue their wants, what ſhould I ſay, the dolefull memory is generally bewailed, ſome remembring the nobility of his birth, ſome his peaceable gouernment, ſome his liberality, ſome his iuſtice, mixed with ſuch mercie, ſome the greatnes of his authority, tempered with ſuch familiar curteſies, that they did more feele the fruites of his clemency, then the pompes of his greatneſſe, and all accounting him the father of his people, and the life of the country. The onely comfort that is left them, is the hope they haue receiued of the gratious yong prince Doreſtus, who immitating his fathers vertues, and in whome they allready ſhine ſo cleere, that it is eaſy to diſcerne him to be a bloſſome of the ſame braunch, a ſtemme of the ſame ſtocke, and a ſonne of the ſame ſire: Tenne daies are ouer paſſed ſince (as well by the conſent of the counſaile, as by the requeſtes of the commons in generall) they would haue eſtabliſhed him in his fathers ſeat: but Doreſtus more ſurcharged with ſorrow, then couetous of a kingdome, and more fit to furniſhe a funerall, then to syt in a princes throne, would in no wiſe conſent to their requeſtes, vntill hee might heare what was become of his father: But they neuer ceaſing their ſute, and hee ouer woried with their importunityes, to ſatisfie their requeſtes, haue adiorned the day of his crownation for fyfueteene daies, if in the meane time they can learne no other tidinges, hee is then content to receiue the diademe, as his proper right and due inheritaunce: I will not further inlarge the ſeuerall coniectures that are gathered of his abſence, ſome immagininge him to bee priuily murthered, ſome thinking him ſecretly vowed to ſome moneſtary or other religious houſe, ſome thinking ſo manye thinges, that ſome knowes not well what to thinke, and yet when they haue all thought, the good king cannot be hard of, neither will I trouble to tell you what ſeuerall examinations hath beene taken, howe many inquiries hath beene made, and what continuall poſting there hath beene
 through the whole realme, let this ſuffice, he cannot be found, and it is thought neceſſary (and that by generall opinion) that there ſhould be a ſoueraigne gouernour, to redreſſe wronges, to puniſh vice, to correct abuſe, to maintaine iuſtice, and to cheariſh vertue: Doreſtus (though againſt his owne wil, yet to ſatisfie their requeſtes) haue aſſigned the day of his crownation
(as I told you) within fyueteene dayes, whereof there are yet fyue to come, if in the meane time there come no other newes, I haue then breefly told you all the newes.
            
            
               The eight Chapter.
               
                  The ſorrow Bruſanus made to heare this newes, and howe Glorioſus vaunted vpon this report.
               
               
                  COrynus who was neereſt toucht with this diſcourſe, yet beſt pleaſd to heere the tale, wherein both Leonarchus the king, and Doreſtus his ſonne were ſo vertuouſly commended, made neither ſemblaunce of ioy nor griefe, but liſtening what other men would anſwere kept himſelfe ſilent: But
Bruſanus, whoſe heauy countenaunce bewraid his ſodaine paſſion ſaid: And is it poſſible that ſo renowned a king, ſo vertuous a prince, and ſo louing a ſoueraigne, ſhould be thus conſumed in his owne realme, nay in his owne court, nay more then that, in his owne priuy chamber, and amongſt his owne ſubiectes, and yet cannot be learned how, well Bruſanus thy hap is the harder, thou haſt left thy parentes, thy kindred and thy country to become a traueller, thy hope was to haue bettered thine owne experience, by the example of him, whoſe vertues were ſo famed through euery nation, but thou findeſt thy ſelfe preuented by vniuſt fortune, and canſt thou not draw her freakes to a platforme of thyne owne profit, arme thy ſelfe againſt all her aſſaults, and beware how thou doſt heereafter truſt her, and eſteeme no better of theſe worldly honours, then as ſlipperie ioyes, ſliding pleaſures, and tranſitory delightes, and thus fixing his heauy eies vppon the ground, he ceaſed further ſpeach: Glorioſus, who was all this while deuiſing how to ſpeake wiſely, after that he had a little rouſed
 himſelfe, bending his browes and putting on his terrible countenaunce, ſaid: Well Leonarchus, if thy conſpiring enymies, haue ſhortened thy date, by vntimely cutting of thy thred of life, vnhappy was thy chaunce that Signior Glorioſus was abſent, whoſe prouident eie, to looke into matters of ſtate, is ynough to preuent all trayterous practiſes, conuey they neuer ſo cloſly, whoſe very lookes are leueled with ſuch auſter aſpect, that they are able to fray the proudeſt practiſer, from al vnlawful attempts, and theſe armes, (that are the miniſters of my diſpleaſure ſhould I but diſcontentedly ſtretch them forth, oh, who were able to abide it, neither ſtrong Sampſon amongſt his philiſtians, nor valiaunt Hercules againſt his vgely monſters, were halfe ſo terrible as angrie Glorioſus againſt the troupes of traitors, then Leonarchus, nay, then infortunate Leonarchus, and in nothing ſo much infortunate, as thus to be ſequeſtred from ſuch a ſtay to thy ſtate, from ſuch a piller of thy preſeruation, and from ſuch a caſtell of thy comforte, as might haue preuented all perilles, what ſo euer thou art happined into, after the whole company had a little ſmiled to themſelues, and had much adoe to forbeare open laughter, Corynus ſaid: it may bee ſir, you were vnknown to Leonarchus, otherwiſe he was ſhrewdly ouer ſéene, ſo much to neglect a gentleman of your quality: My frend
(anſwered Glorioſus) thou doſt preſſe me to fare, I pray thée haue care of thy ſelfe, and ſeeke not thine owne diſmembring, by to much vrginge my patience▪ with thy vnſeaſonable ſpéeches, doſt thou thinke Glorioſus could be vnknowne to
Leonarchus, when his court hath beene beautified with my preſence, and whoſe pallaces were adorned with my perſon: No, no, and therefore I tell thée (thou manne of little vnderſtandinge) thy woordes are to much preiudicial to the prerogatiue of my reputation, but it pleaſeth me to impute thine erroure, to the want of knowledge, ſo that in beareing with the one, I am contented to pardon the other, and therefore I admoniſh thée heereafter to take heed how thou doſt place thy phraſe, to a gentleman of the kings court: Well ſir anſwered
Corynus, ſith I doe find courtiers to be ſo captions, you ſhall ſée heereafter that I will learne to ſpeake more wiſelier, when
 I haue occation to talke with them, in the meane time, me thinkes heere is a poore man that lookes heauily on the matter: then turning himſelfe to Caſtus, he ſaid, howe nowe my good frend, what newes with you in the country, it ſeemeth by thy cheare, that all ſhould not be well.
            
            
               The ninth Chapter.
               
                  The wofull diſcourſe of Caſtus: what craft in the country amongſt Lawyers, and what adiorning amongſt maieſtrates.
               
               
                  CAſtus, firſt breathing forth a pitious ſigh, as the meſſenger of ſome miſhappe aunſwered. Alas ſir, a comfortles cauſe requireth a careful countenance, and a cureleſſe griefe, a deſperate minde, and if my newes be hapleſſe that I haue brought from the country, ſo now they be helpleſſe by that I hear from the court, when we be depriued (as I perceiue) from our good king, the only anker-holde of al my hope, that ſhould haue miniſtred right to my infinite wronges. And are your wronges ſuch (aunſwered Corynus) that they are not other wiſe to be remedied, then by the king himſelfe, if I be not deceiued, there be lawes in the countrie to determine your right, you haue likewiſe maieſtrates to adminiſter the lawe, in mine opinion your cauſe wer very ſtrange if it ſhould not be relieued by one or both. Very true ſir (aunſwered Caſtus) my cauſe is ſtrange indéede, and yet if I were'aſwell ſtored with coyne wherwith to corrupt, as I am furniſhed with ſorrowe whereof to complaine, I néeded not haue trauelled to the courte for redreſſe, neither haue I omitted (ſo farre as my poore abillitye woulde ſtretche) both to atempt lawe, and to fée aturnies, but mine aduerſary is wealthy, and therefore worſhipfulll, whoſe loftye countenance is enoughe to cary out his lewd conſcience, and although the lawe in it ſelfe, intendeth nothing but right, yet as it is ordered by ſome that hath the handeling of it, it is made the very inſtrument of wronge, yea the moſt of them framing their plea therafter as they be féede not according to the truth, and for priuat aduantage, or how many delaies can they forge, from court to court, from day to day, from time to time, yea from yeare to year: then haue they ſuch diſtinctions,
 ſuch errours, ſuch demurs, ſuche quillites, ſuche ſhiftes, and ſo many deceites that the plaintife ſhal paſſe a thouſand troubles, before he may procéede to one tryall. Oh theſe golden dumbe ſhewes are ſoe mightie in working, that hee that hath them to giue, they will make iudges them ſelues to become both deafe and blinde. Thus riche men néede ſpeake but a word, and all wil hear them, when poore men may ſhead their teares but no man pitie them: But after that I had thus tried my ſelfe in the lawe, I indeuoured by petition to preſent my cauſe before the pitileſſe maieſtrates, but alas ther began my greater miſerie. For firſt euen amongſt their baſe and ſeely porters I found a peuiſh pride, and ſuch a ſcorneful demeanure, that I might not be ſuffered to ſtand nere, muchleſſe to enter their gates without a bribe, but then againe amongſt their clarkes: O what gaping for greater gyftes, and what loking after coſtly rewardes, the which my pouerty not able to ſearche vnto, what found I then but coy countenances curriſh language, & other like diſdainful demeanure, thus leauing their comfortleſſe houſes, I was dryuen to giue attendance in the colde ſtreates, where after longe and tedious waiting, the very horſekéepers would ſhoulder me from their maiſter, who if perhaps through my pitious exclamations, hee chaunced to caſt his head aſide, it was either to afright me with his terrible lookes, or vtterly to diſmaye mée with his churliſh checkes. Thus hauing tryed all, but finding none, to pitie or comforte my diſtreſſe, I determined with my ſelfe to trauell to the court, hoping there to find ſome gentleman, attendant about his maieſty, that might preferre my ſute to the king him ſelfe, who is accuſtomed to heare ſutors with more expedition, and to kéepe them with leſſe expences: but alas, I perceiue my purpoſe is preuented, and I left deſtitute of all hope for euer to be happy.
            
            
               The tenth Chaper.
               
                  The aunſwere of Martianus, whether it be better for a ſuter, the courte or country.
               
               IT is but a bare comfort (anſwered Martianus) wherthe beſt choice hath yet aſſurance of doubtful end, you haue ceaſt your
 playnt in the country, to become a ſutor in the court, and herein you may be compared to him that goes out of gods bleſſing into the warme ſunne: do you thinke to finde ſuche curtiſie amongſt courtiers: you ſay you go to complaine of a wronge, and peraduenture to him that will giue no man his right, you ſay you are poore and vnable to giue a fee, but you ſhall hardly finde him in the courte, that will do any thinge for gods ſake: in the country if you found ſuch churliſhe regardes, in the courte you ſhall find as proude lookes: yea the very doorekeepers to theſe greate men in the courte, will looke for more cappes and curteſies then (I aunſwere) you haue bin accuſtomed vnto, and yet ſtill receiue your obayſance, without any regarde of your buſines: but do you complaine of bribing in the country, and would you come empty handed to the courte: where ther is no grace without gold, nor no friend without a fee: and if your aduerſarie be wealthy (as you haue ſaide) and that he be able to ſende fiue hundred duccattes on his meſſage, do you not thinke them able to worke wonders in the court, as the golden dumbe ſhowes (you ſpeake of) could euer do in the country, yes be ſure, they are not onely able to make men blind and deafe, but they wil open his lippes that was dumbe, to preſent al manner of 
                     •
                  eaſinges, yea for a néed before the king himſelfe. I am ſorie my experience ſhould ſerue me ſo well to diſplay the court of Epirus, but he that himſelfe hath béene ſurely prickt, can bid others take héede how they run amongſt thorns, and I that haue ſped ſo ill with my courting, can wiſhe others to beware, how they come thither a ſewing, if they be not able to maintaine bribing. It is now thirtie yeares ſith I became a ſouldier, from which time I haue ſerued the king in all occations againſt his enimies in the fielde, the reſt of the time I haue continued in his garriſons: in this meane ſpace, I haue ſpent what my friendes left me, which was ſome thing; I haue loſt part of my bloud, which was more: and I haue conſumed my prime of youth and floriſhing yeeres, which was moſt: and comforting my ſelfe with ſome hope of happy rewarde (for my better helpe now in my declining years) with this reſolution I came to the courte, what mony I was able to make, I put it in my purſſe to bear my charges: I haue ther continued theſe ſix
 monthes, with cappes and curtiſies downe to the ground, and ſome time, may it pleaſe your honour, otherwhiles, I beſeche your worſhip, but neither honorable, nor worſhipful, that I could find to better my ſtate but I haue ſpent my mony, & am come away as you ſee. And yet I muſte confeſſe that for the king himſef, ther was neuer prince yt was more bountiful, nor liberall, nor that hath giuen oftiner or greater rewards. But alas poore king (if without arrogancy I may pitie a king) he hath beene nothing more deceiued then in beſtowing his rewards: for being driuen to ſée with other mens eies, to heare with other mens eares, and to reward by other mens commendations, it is ſeene that promotion is determined in ſuche fort, as fancy rather confirmeth the election then diſcretion, in ſo much that deſert may now go a begging, when al the world is guided by opinion, and many a one hath beene rewarded, & commended by ſome noble man for his great ſeruice, that hath but helpe him off with his hoſe when hee went to bed at night, or peraduenture a ruffeſetter, a bottel carier, a newes bringer, a parricite, a ſlaterer or ſom other ſuch like miniſter of his pleaſure, and it may be, a bribe giuer, for a hundred aungelles of gold, in ſuch a matter, are of greater vertue, then all the aungelles that be in heauen, yet (as I haue ſaide) ſuch a one (vpon ſome noble mans commendations) ſhall receiue greater recompence, then the man of good deſerte indéede, of any condition or qualitie what ſoeuer: ſo that in the courte, pleaſinge of humours, is found to be moſt profitable, where a foole ſhal glorie of more ſauour, then a wiſe man of acceptance. But I pray you ſir (aunſwered Corynus) why did you not make your requeſt to the king himſelfe, who as it ſhold ſéem by your owne wordes is forwarde enoughe, to recompence wel doing. Very true (anſwered Martianus) and to the king himſelfe I preſented my ſute, who with moſt gratious promiſes, and comfortable ſpeeches, willed mee to commit my cauſe to ſome noble man, that might commende it to his maieſtie and get my diſſpatche: but alas, our daintie nobles are ſoe dangerous to bee ſpoke with 
                     〈…〉
                  , that it is wel if in a monthes waiting, you may attaine to three words ſpeaking: for ſome times if I met them in merry talke with my betters, my petitions came then out of
 ſeaſon to interrupt their pleaſures, an other time if I met anye of them ſolitarie by himſelfe, my lord was then in ſome melancolly moode and out of time to be ſpoken with all: thus betwéene mirth and melancolly, poore ſutors maye longe inough watch their ſeaſons, yet neuer finde them in ſeaſon to do them any good: but could I once againe haue come to the preſence of the kinge, I woulde haue made no doubt, of that recompence that now I neuer looke after. And why ſo (anſwered
Corynus) if Doreſtus be the man that he is taken for, good deſerte canne neuer goe vnrewarded, god for bid hee ſhoulde ſit in his fathers ſeate, if he ſhould neglect his fathers vertues.

                  Corynus, Martianus, and Caſtus, are arreſted of treaſon and brought to the court to the young prince Doreſtus, there to be tried.
               
               
                  GLorioſus, who had ouer heard all, and by their ſpéeches did thinke himſelfe to be well furniſhed with ſuffitient matter to picke a thanke (when he came to the courte) but ſpecially of theſe laſt words ſpoken by Corynus, god forbid that Doreſtus ſhould ſit in his fathers ſeate) went preſently to the criminall iudge of the citie, charginge him in the behalfe of the younge prince Doreſtus, to apprehend, both Corynus, Martianus, and
Caſtus, and to ſee them brought to the court as traitors, where he himſelfe would be ready to auouch againſt them, treſon to the king, ſlaunder to his courte, and infamie to his whole gouernment, this ſaide, without any longer ſtay, he tooke his iorney towardes the prince (with greate expedition) intending to aggrauate the matter as much as might be, the rather to win himſelfe reputation, in performing ſoe notable a peece of ſeruice,
(as he ſuppoſed this would fall out to be) the maieſtrates vnderſtanding Glorioſus to be a courtier, hearing his words to importe a matter of treſon, and as it was thought the king being ſo long miſſing, was brought to ſome caſualtie by the practiſe of treſon, accompanied therefore with ſome conuenient number he came to the Inne where he areſted the foreſaid
 three of treaſon, and although the apprehenſion in this manner was ſome amaſement to their mindes, yet it was moſt ſtrange to Corynus to be thus taken for a traytor to the king, but after that he had a while deliberated what mighte be the matter, hee requeſted the Offycer to let him vnderſtande, whether it were by direction, information, or what other inſtruction he had thus to apprehende them, the other aunſweared, ſir you ſhall finde mine owne authority ſuffycient to arreſt a traytor, for the reſt what there is farther to charge you withall, you ſhall vnderſtand at your comming to the younge Prince Doreſtus, before whome I mind preſently to bring you: and hauing a ſuffycient company to guard them, forwards they go, the priſoners euery one comforting himſelf, knowing his own cōſcience to be clere.
Bruſanus that had giuen good héede to euery accidente, and perceiuing by the former circumſtances that Corynus, Martianus and Caſtus were méere ſtrangers the one to the other, thought it therfore impoſsible that there ſhould be any compact of treaſon betweene them, and hauinge a ſpeciall likinge to Corynus, deſirous to ſee what might fal out againſt▪ him he followed him, who when he had ouertaken, he proffered any courteſy wherein a ſtranger might ſtéede him, whether with his traueil or his purſe, they were both at his commaundemente: Corynus againe in as greate a league of likinge towardes Bruſanus, and deſirous to do him ſome honor, before he ſhould leaue the country, requeſted him to accept of a priſoners thankes, and that he woulde not leaue his company, till, it was determined what ſhould become of him, to which requeſt Bruſanus very willingly agréed vnto: they traueil ſo long that they come to the courte, where Glorioſus was attending and had quickely certified the Prince of their arriuall, who commaunded that the priſoners ſhould be ſafely kept vntill the next morninge, when himſelfe would be ready to heare their cauſe.

                  Doreſtus ſitteth in iudgement, Glorioſus accuſeth Caſtus.
               
               THe next day, hee beeing accompanied with the nobles that were in the court: came into the common place of Iuſtice, vſually called by the name of The houſe of reformation. This houſe of reformation, was a very large roome, wher the kings of Epirus, in the auncient time were accuſtomed perſonally to ſit, at the leaſt thrée times euery wéeke, to heare ſuters and to diſpatch, all manner of cauſes and controuerſies, that were betwéene their ſubiectes, and to miniſter Iuſtice, to as many as were to demaund it: and in this houſe of reformation it was euer accuſtomed, that if there wer many ſuters, the complaints of the poore were euer heard, before the requeſtes of the rich: The Prince being come to this place, after that hee had geuen reuerence to the throne of maieſty, wherin his father had bene accuſtomed to ſit, then ſitting himſelfe downe in the next ſeat, the noblemen likewiſe euery one takinge his place: the priſoners were brought to the bar, where Glorioſus was likewiſe ready to informe, but before they did procéede to the hearing of the matter, the younge Prince deliuered theſe wordes: They make themſelues guilty of great iniuſtice, who béeing appointed of God to perſecute the wicked with the ſwoorde drawne, will yet keepe their handes cleane from bloude, whereas the wicked in the meane time commits all manner of ſin, and that vncontrouled: and it is no leſſe cruelty to puniſhe no offence, then not to forgiue any, the one beeing an abuſe of clemency, the true ornament of a Soueraigne, and the other to turne authority into tyranny: neuertheleſſe maieſtrates in the execution of Iuſtice, ought to take great héede leaſt by ouer great ſeuerity, they hurt more then they heale, for the ſeate of a Iudge that is too ſeuere ſéemeth to bee a gibbet alreadye erected, wée muſt then diligently note, that as it is the duety of all maieſtrates, to chaſtice and to puniſh euery malefactor, ſo likewiſe they muſt beware, leaſt vnder pretence of exerciſing Iuſtice, they fall into an other kinde of iniuſtice through ouer-much rigour, for too much ſeuerity, cauſeth men to be miſled for cruelty,
 and belongeth rather to a beaſtly and ſauuage nature, then to the nature of man: for clemency & compaſsion, neuer ought to be ſeperated from a good and iuſt ſentence, which is to holde ſmall faultes excuſed, or but lightly to puniſh them (prouided all way that iuſtice be not violated) for as the wiſe man ſaith, that it was ill to be ſubiect to a Prince vnder whome nothinge was tollerated, but worſe where all thinges were left at randon. Let vs learne therefore for the concluſion of our diſcourſe, ſo to vſe iuſtice with mediocrity, that neither we learne to ouer much ſeuerity, nor yet may be ledd by too much lenity. Doreſtus hauinge thus ended his exhortation, the whole company that heard it, were wonderfully delighted, ſome extollinge hys vertue, and other commending this his procéedinge: after a ſilence commaunded and that euery man was huſht: Glorioſus was willed to ſay what he had to inferre againſt the priſoners, and accordinge to the cuſtome of the place, Caſtus cauſe was firſt to be examined, hee was therefore willed to ſtande foorth, and Glorioſus commanuded to procede in that he had to charge him: who after he had firſt cléered his throat, then caſtinge vp his eyes to the roofe of the houſe, he diſcourſed thus: I ſhall not neede (gratious Prince) to traueil much by circumſtances, or to vſe many wordes, to make my proofe the better againſt this wretched worme of the worlde, my credite béeinge ſuch here in the court, the teſtimony might ſeeme ſufficient, that Glorioſus hauing ſpoke the word, it ſhoulde not bee gaineſayde: to come to the purpoſe, as mine eares then glowed to heare, ſo my hart now panteth to thinke, what hatefull ſpéeches were pronounced by this vnhappy man Caſtus, ſo exclaiming of the lawyers, ſo cryinge out againſt the maieſtrate, ſo ſlaunderinge of them both, as though there were neither law nor iuſtice to bee hadd within the whole dominions of Epirus: the which béeing waid in a due conſideration, is not a little ſtaine to your woorthy fathers gouernement. Stay there Glorioſus (ſaide the Prince
Doreſtus) I muſt not ſuffer you to mince the matter ſo fitte to your purpoſe, for it is not the Princes fault, if Iuſtice bee not miniſtred, when hee hath appointed maieſtrates for the ſame purpoſe, but it is his blame if he deferre puniſhment when hee vnderſtandeth the contrary, the reſt of your woordes importe
 no other matter then an exclamation made by this poore man againſt the maieſtrates, and perhaps for wante of Iuſtice, but whatſoeuer bee the cauſe, it reſteth in himſelfe to auoide the crime, for as the ſoueraigne Prince, acknowledgeth after God none greater then himſelf, ſo the maieſtrate holdeth his power after god of the ſouraigne prince, priuat men muſt therefore acknowledge both the prince and maieſtrate, euery one in his place of iuryſdiction with all honour and reuerence: Speake then Caſtus, what haſt thou to alleadge in thine owne excuſe, for theſe matters impoſed againſt thee heere by Glorioſus.
               
            
            
               The 13 Chapter.
               
                  Caſtus anſwerch for himſelfe
               
               THe poore man being altogether ſurpriſed with an incounter of feare and griefe, was not able to ſpeake one woorde, but wringing his handes, hanging downe his head, and caſting his eies in ſuch ſort, as who ſhould ſay, alaſſe, if my cauſe be not to be pittied what ſhould if auaile me to aunſweare: but the good Prince obſeruing his demeanure, and minding to cut off his timerous ſilence, ſpake to him as followeth: My good fréend, let not this courtly preſence, diſmay thy countrey plainneſſe, but comfort thy ſelfe with hope of this place: which diſtinguiſheth no perſons either by fortunes faune: or pouerties frowne, neither yet to meaſure the perſon by his wealth, but iuſtly to peaſe the equity of his cauſe, mercy and iuſtice are the meanes, wher with I minde to temper my procéedinges, but yet in ſuch mediocrity as the one ſhall not be confounded in the other: perſuade thy ſelfe therefore that thou ſhalt be heard with equitye, and therfore ſpare not, but comfort thy ſelfe, and ſpeake boldly. When the prince with his incouragement had ſet the poore mans tongue at liberty, he framed his complaint in this order: It is truth (moſt gratious prince) that twenty yeares are fully ouer paſſed ſince my father deceaſſed, in his life time called by the name of Codron, and after his death, leauing me his heire to a poore country cottage, yet ſeated in a moſt pleaſant orchard, planted (by my ſaid father) in the prime of his youth, yet alas
 in a moſt infortunate ſoile, though happy inough, both for the ſerenity of the aire, and fertility of the ground, but onely vnhappy in that it was ſeated to neere an ill neighbour, for but on the other ſide of the hedge, there dwelt a gentleman whoſe liuing is great, whoſe credite is much, whoſe conſcience is leaſt, whoſe name is Signior Orlando, whoe hauing manye times taken ſuruey of my poore plot, the frutes whereof yeelded the greateſt reliefe wherewith to ſuſtaine my ſelfe, my wife and children (but that which poore men take for their profites, is vſed of gentlemen but for their pleaſures) and thinking how commodious it lay for his houſe, hee was many times in hand with me to haue bought the inheritaunce, the which I as often denayd him, being the onely ſuccorſe that I had to repoſe in, but after that, o how many quarrels were pickt vpon ſmall occaſion, how was I berated if a chicken had but flyen ouer the hedge, the legges of my cattell were broken, if they ſtrayed but foorth of mine owne gates, yea my ſelfe was euerye daye threatned by his ſeruauntes, that in the ende gladd to curry fauour, I came vnto him deſiring his fréendſhip: offering him my orcharde for his pleaſure to walke in at all times, and to make a way through his owne ground, for his better paſſage, and for ſome part of the fruit that he beſt liked off for his own eatinge, and my ſelfe at his commaundement to doo him any ſeruice that I coulde, but all this woulde not ſerue, there was nothinge would pleaſe him, but the whole poſſeſsion of mine orchard, the which in the ende hee deſired but for three yeares, and in the meane ſpace to geue an annuall rent, and although in very troth, I was not contented, yet glad to winne his fauour I agreed, thinking to beare the brunt for ſo ſmall a time, the which in deed, I might the better haue done, if he had paid me the rent he promiſt, but I had no ſooner giuen him place, voiding my ſelfe into a little roome not far of, but mine orchard was incloſed with a mighty ditch, ſeueralde into his owne ground but for the rent that was promiſed, although his thrée yeares are more then thrée times expired, the day is yet to come that euer I could receiue groat, to conclude, he not onely with holdeth my rent, but hee likewiſe holdeth me out of my houſe, and againſt all right, hath kept me out of my owne, theſe
 tenne yeares▪ I cannot denie but in this meane time I haue attempted lawe, but I muſt confeſſe it is to my great charge, for his great ſtore of crownes ſo ouer weied my right amongſt the lawiers, that in foure yeares ſuing, I could not bring my cauſe to one daies hearing, but ſhould I ſay nowe after I had bine thus coſined amongſt the lawiers, o no, I perceiue it is offenciue, let me then ſay thus, after I had bine conſumed amongſt them, and that I was not longer able to ſée them, I made my complaint to the maieſtrates, but if it bee a fault to ſay I found them pitileſſe, I humbly craue pardon (moſt gratious prince) for this is all that Signior Glorioſus is able to charge me with.
            
            
               The fourteenth Chapter.
               
                  Glorioſus accuſeth Martian us, who anſwereth his accuſation.
               
               THe poore man hauing thus finiſhed his ſpeache, was willed to ſtand by, and Glorioſus was now to inferre againſt
Martianus, who procéeded in this wiſe. Although I haue founde by the art of Logique, learned by the rules of Rethorique, and gathered by the preceptes of philoſophy, what vnneceſſarie members theſe ſouldiers are in a well gouerned ſtate (in ſo much that many wiſe men déemeth them worthy of nothing then not to be) yet with all the learning I haue gathered out of my libraries, with al the examples I haue ſéene in my perigrinations, with all the experiments I haue founde in the courte, nor with all the art that is in my head, the verye ſtoore-houſe of wiſdome, and from whence whole fountaines, nay huge flouds of eloquence doth continually abounde, yet (as I haue ſaide) al this will not ſerue me, to reiterate the wordes pronounced in diſgrace of the whole courte of Epirus, by this man of little reputation, I meane this ſouldier. His ſentences, althoughe not artificially couched, yet ſtrained after a fulſome manner, to the very full ſea marks of reproche, his phraſes very harſhe, but more ſpitefull, his wordes vnaptly placed, yet according to the literall ſence, all applied to a malitious purpoſe,
 I could heare diſtinguiſh vpon euery ſillable, and (I giue god thankes for it) I could (according to art) make diuiſion of his whole ſpeeches into ſeuerall partes, & ſo examine the maior and minor, of al his arguments, as I might refell his propoſitions, and vtterly deny his allegations: But this is inoughe for Signior Glorioſus to conclud, Martianus hath diſtained the courte with ſlaunder, and muſt clenſe it againe with the price of his bloud. The young gallantes of the courte, that ſtoode by and had ouer-hearde all, wonderfully commended Glorioſus, proteſting, that he had ſpoken very wiſely, thinking him a very méet mā to be a counceller, but ye yong prince Doreſtus ſaid as followeth. So farre as I can perceiue Glorioſus, your learning is more then the matter where-with you haue charged
Martianus, the ſome of all your eloquence concerneth a ſlaunder to ye court, but how or in what manner there it ſtil reſteth, but ſay Martianus, what occation hath led thée to ſpeake ill of the place: Martianus aunſwered thus. Moſt gratious prince, if in my words I ſhall not obſerue that reuerence that I know is apertinente to this preſence, I moſt humbly craue pardon, and the rather for that my bringing vp hath not beene ſo muche to directe my ſpeeches to princes in their pallaces, as to ſouldiers in the fieldes: to aunſwere then to the matter where-with
Glorioſus hath charged me, the begining of whoſe tale is ſo ſpiced with ſuch a deale of learning, that I know not what to ſay to it, wherby I perceiue many courtiers to be much more fruitefull then haares, for as it is ſaide, when they haue beene at bucke, within fortie daies after they lytter there leuerites, then againe they goe proude, are conceiued, and all at an inſtant: but theſe goe proude euery day in the wéeke, waxe great with learning before they conceiue it, and are deliuered of the full burthen of their wit, at the leaſt fortie weekes before it is begotten. Many wiſe men (ſaith Glorioſus) ſoe condemneth ſouldiers, as they forbid him to haue place in a well gouerned ſtate: and I neuer hearde yet, but an honeſt ſouldier, was a more profitable member to his country, then any vaine headed courtier: whoſe gentry (as it is written) comes from their parentes; whoſe wealth, is the harueſt of their flattery; whoſe victories, are the fruits of their ſouldiers: for the firſt, them
 ſelues blot with their vices; the ſecond, they conſume with their vanitie; the laſt, is attributed to more then them ſelues, I can compare a courtier to nothing better then an ape, which no man would kéepe but to procure laughter, and the vſe of the courtier, is all for pleaſure, nought for profite. It is further inferred againſte me by this man of little wit, (this courtier I meane) how ſlaunderous I haue béene to the whole courte of
Epirus; I can not make ſo learned a demonſtration of the matter as Glorioſus hath done, but according to a ſouldiers capacitie. I will ſhewe you by example: ſuppoſe I ſhould ſay (as I truſt I ſhal neuer haue cauſe to thinke) ye 
                  Glorioſus the courtier wer a very wiſe man, now, you muſt vnderſtande this (according to the interpretation of Glorioſus) to bee ſpoken in ye cōmendation of the whole court, & wher my propoſitiō includeth but a perticuler perſon he wold infer a general cōcluſion. May it pleaſe your Grace nowe to vnderſtand, I haue ſerued your (moſt renowmed Father) theſe thirtie years as a Souldier, and comforting my ſelf with ſome hope of reward, to help me now in mine elder yeares. I came to the Court, where I became a ſuter, but thoſe eies that looke into all procéedings, and are watchfull onely to their owne profites, and loath that any fat ſhould bee licked from their owne fingers, will ſuffer no good turne to paſſe which they can hinder, neither can I denie
(moſt gracious Prince) but in lamenting mine owne miſfortune, that haue bene ſo long a ſuter, that I am now become a begger: I haue complained that ſo many drones grating on the princes purſe, ſhold eat vp the hony from thoſe that beſt deſerue it. For the puniſhment of mine treſpaſſe, I humbly appeale to your gracious clemency, for I perceiue, if Glorioſus were my Iudge, no leſſe would content him, then the price of the bloud in my belly, for a peniworth of ſlander to his perſon. I will not tell you heere, into what a pelting chafe Glorioſus was driuen into vpon theſe ſpeaches: I pray you imagin, that he was wonderfully angry, and kept ſuch a ſtur vpon the matter, that there was no rule with him, till in the end the prince himſelfe willed him to holde his peace like a foole. Wel quoth
Glorioſus, ſith your Grace ſpeakes ſo gently vnto mee, I am contented at your intreatie to bear with the matter, otherwiſe
 I proteſt by Iupiter himſelfe, he goes not vpon two legs (if he beare the name of a ſouldier) but I would haue made him to haue repented this preſumption nine hundred yeares hence.
            
            
               The fifteenth Chapter.
               
                  Glorioſus accuſeth Corynus of treaſon againſt Doreſtus, the circumſtances wherof are briefly laid open by Bruſanus.
               
               AFter the gentleman had bene in this ſort qualified, he was willed to infourme what hee had againſt Corynus, and in this wiſe hee beganne to tell his tale. Your Grace hath alreadye heard by that is paſt, howe infamous the firſt hath beene vnto the Countrey Magiſtrate: The ſecond hath not feared to ſlander the court: but this third, in plain tearmes, hath preſumed to touch your owne perſon. The circumſtances are but ſhort, and thus followeth the wordes: God forbid that Doreſtus ſhould ſit in his fathers ſeat: the ſence is plaine, and I will once againe repeat the wordes: God forbid, that Doreſtus ſhould ſit in his fathers ſeat. Let mee ſee now what gloſe can they ſet to this text? what ifs or ands can they patch to theſe ſpeaches, to alter the ſence from high Treaſon? The whole company that ſtood by beganne altogether to crie treaſon, treaſon, treaſon: but ſilence being commaunded, Corynus was willed to ſpeake for himſelfe: who in this ſort aunſwered. Prince Doreſtus, Sophocles the Tragedian, being accuſed before the magiſtrates of dotage, repeated vnto them his Tragedy of Oedipus Coloneus, (which at that inſtant he had made) ſo that his accuſers confounded in their owne ouerwéening, departed with a ſhameful repulſe. So I am likewiſe accuſed of treaſon, and I am willed to make mine anſwere: ſee héere worthy Prince, this wrinckled face, which many yeares hath withered, & ſhould betoken ſtaidnes: beholde theſe hoarie hairs, whoſe color time hath changed, & ſhould cary ſome experience: and although by experience, I could anſwer in other circumſtances, yet I hope this ſhal aſwel find grace to cléer me of treaſon, as the Tragedy of Sophocles to acquite him of dotage. This anſwere ſéemed confuſed to the multitude, but the prince
Doreſtus who had marked the graue aſpectes of this antient
 man Corynus, gathered a further meaning of his wordes then the reſt could wel conceiue, and whether it were by ſom ſecret inſtincte of nature, or what other motion it was that moued him, he fell into a moſt affection at liking of Corynus, but Bruſanus that had ſtand by all this while, preſſing forth ſaid as followeth: Let not a ſtrangers preſumption breed offence,
(worthy prince Doreſtus) that oppoſſeth himſelfe vncald for, to teſtifie a truth, and although the matter that I pretende might craue long diſcourſe, aduiſed purpoſe, and ſeemely conueyaunce, yet the rare vertues which I ſee to accompany your calling, the ſinguler iuſtice that I ſée to carry your procéedinges, ſhall make me be the leſſe tedious: My ſelfe (noble prince) being led with delight to behold ſtrange Cities, to diſcouer vnknown places, & to better mine own experience, haue left my natiue country, and betaken my ſelfe to pretenced trauell, and bycauſe I will leaue nothing which the neceſſity of the cauſe inforceth me to open, though (peraduenture) (in a curtous conceit my wordes might ſmel of flattery) true it is that the renowne I haue hard of this country of Epirus, the wiſdome of the Prince that gouerned it, the wiſe men that inhabite it, the true Iuſtice that ruleth it: though one of them were ſufficient to moue admiration, yet the moſt of them haue directed my trauell into this country, and bendinge my iourney towardes this place, by the way I ouertooke this merchant Corynus: After ſalutations paſſed betweene vs, wee had not rid far but wee were likewiſe ouertaken by this Glorioſus, what ſpeaches paſt between vs, bicauſe they are neither fitting to our purpoſe, nor neceſſary for the place, I will therefore omit them, but on we rid all together to the Citie of Vtica, where determining to reſt our ſelues, in our lodging we met theſe other two Martianus and Caſtus: Martianus being new come from the court (as himſelfe reported) was the firſt that gaue vs to vnderſtand of the king your fathers miſſing, Caſtus on the other ſide was traueling towardes the court (and as it ſhould ſeeme) to ſeeke for iuſtice, but now diſcouraged by theſe late newes, Martianus againe relating his cauſe (as euen nowe before this preſence) concluded likewiſe his little hope, to attaine recompence for longs ſeruice, marke nowe (vertuous
 prince) for heere is the point of all this treaſon: Corynus that had ouer hard all, comforted the poore man in theſe ſpeeches: It were pitie my frend (ſaid Corynus) that good deſert ſhould goe vnrewarded, and god forbid that Doreſtus ſhould ſit in his fathers ſeat, and neglect his fathers vertues: I could farther enlearg touching the premiſſes, but what ſhould I néed, when I finde your owne vertue (worthy Prince) more ſufficient to conſider of euery neceſſary circumſtance, then mine own little skill is able to deliuer it.
            
            
               The ſixteenth Chapter.
               
                  Bruſanus is diſcouered to be the Prince of Hungaria, a combination of freendſhip betweene Doreſtus and him.
               
               IN this meane time that Bruſanus was thus diſcourſinge, a gentleman in the company that ſometimes had beene in the courte of Hungaria, whiſperinge in the Princes eare, aſſured him that the party which preſented that ſpéech, was Bruſanus, the onely ſonne of Myletto king of Hungaria: the which when
Doreſtus vnderſtood, taking the better ſuruay of the man, and liſtening more attentiuely to his ſpéeches, although hee were wonderfully delighted with his woordes, yet hee was a greate deale better pleaſed with his perſonage, and hauinge finiſhed his tale, Doreſtus requeſted Bruſanus to tell his name, and what countreyman he was, Bruſanus aunſweared, ſir, I was borne in Hungaria, a gentleman by birth, and by name Bruſanus: It is not vnlikely (quoth Doreſtus) that Bruſanus, the Prince of Hungaria, ſhould be any leſſe then a gentleman, and if there be no other occaſion then I can imagine, Bruſanus can be no leſſe then welcome to Doreſtus. Bruſanus ſéeing himſelfe to be thus diſcouered, briefly made aunſweare: and Bruſanus deſireth no greater contentment, then to be an aſſured frend to
Doreſtus. Doreſtus then ariſinge from his ſeate, and incountring with Bruſanus ſaide: and in token of perpetuall amitye with Bruſanus, Doreſtus heere giueth his hande, and biddeth
Bruſanus moſt hartely welcome: the one of them then imbracinge the other, with more then ordinary affection, the whole
 company wer delighted to ſée the courteous demeanure of theſe two gallant yong Princes: but aboue the reſt Corynus eſpecially reioyced at the ſighte, for knowinge now that Bruſanus was the Prince of Hungaria, commended him in his imagination to be the moſt rare and towardly young Prince that liued.
            
            
               The ſeauenteenth Chapter.
               
                  Doreſtus procedeth to iudgement, he maketh choyce of Corinus to direct him in his counſayles.
               
               AFter the two Princes had one the other thus entertained.
Doreſtus willing a ſeat to be prepared, cauſed Bruſanus to ſit downe next vnto himſelfe: and being thus ſetteled: Doreſtus mindinge to procéede in iuſtice, deliuered theſe woordes: The Office of a good Prince is to defende the common wealth, to helpe the innocent, to aide the ſimple, to correct the offender, to relieue the poore, to honour the vertuous, to puniſhe the vitious, to bridell the ambitious, and by iuſtice to geue euery one his owne: and common wealthes are not loſt, for that Princes liue in pleaſure, but becauſe they haue no care of iuſtice, neither do people murmure, when the Prince doth recreate his perſon, but when he is ſlacke to redreſſe wrongs. O that princes did know what it were to take charge of a kingdome, hee ſhould find that to be iuſt in himſelfe, were honour to his perſon, but to miniſter iuſtice, is profite to the whole commonwealth: it is not therefore inough for him to be vertuous in his owne perſon, but he is alſo bound to root al vices from amongſt his people: But what profite is it for a prince himſelfe to bee honeſt, and thoſe that ſhould adminiſter iuſtice vnder him to be diſſolute, For a prince to bee true, and his officers falſe, for a prince to be gentle and his officers cruell: And hath it not ben often knowen, that where the prince himſelfe hath bene carefull, thoſe that he hath put moſt in truſt, haue bene negligent: I will for a time diſſemble ſome thinge of mine owne knowledge, when we ſhall néede no other preſident at this time, then the complainte of this poore man Caſtus, in redreſſe of whoſe cauſe I do héere decrée, that Orlando ſhall ſpéedily reſtore him
 againe to his houſe and orchard, and for the annuall rente that was concluded on betwéene them, he ſhall reſtore it him foure fold, and that for ſo many yeares as are behinde.
               I doe further ordaine, that the Lawyers which haue taken his money, and not ending his cauſe, ſhall repay it double: the magiſtrate likewiſe that denied him iuſtice, I doe heere diſcharge him from bearing office, and for the ſmall regarde that hee hath had to the complaint of the poore, I doe ceaze him at fiue hundred pound fine, to bee diſtributed to the reliefe of the poore. For thee Martianus that haſt ſerued ſo long a ſouldier, it is not requiſite, that the vertue of valiancy ſhould goe vnrewarded, for good ſouldiers muſt be cheriſhed, and in reſpect of thy long ſeruice, and to comfort thee now in thy latter yeares, I doe héere beſtow vpon thee three hundred crowns, that ſhall preſently be paid vnto thee, and I doe further giue thee a penſion of three hundred crownes by the yeare, to bee paid vnto thee during thy naturall life. Corynus, I doe heere acquite thee of treaſon, thy wordes rather proceeding of honeſt affection: but if thou haſt committed a fault, it touched but my ſelfe, and good Princes ought not ſo much to reuenge their own iniuries, as to defend thoſe that are iniuried: Hee ſhould pardon wrongs that are done to his own perſon, but reuenge the leaſt ill that is committed againſt the Common-wealth: and for mine owne part, ſince I came to the ſtate of diſcretion, I haue euer had two things before mine eies, which is, not to reuenge with rigour vpon mine enemies, nor to bee vnthankfull to my friends: and as it becommeth a good Prince, to haue more regard to the benefit of his Countrey, then to the delights of his perſon: yet for that they are often times negligent in manie things, not ſo much for that they haue no deſire to fore-ſee, as becauſe there are none that dare warne them. I will that from hence forward thou be attendant about me, my ſelfe allowing thee a ſufficient ſtipend for thy maintenaunce: thy office ſhall be to giue me counſaile in all my affaires, and to aduertiſe me of ſuch faults and imperfections as thou ſhalt ſee to appeare in me, and if thou ſhalt ſee me to neglect my fathers proceedings, I will that thou ſhalt reprooue me: and although there be many others, by whome I am counſailed by, yet amongeſt them
 all, I reſerue my ſelfe to be familiar with thee, hoping by thy graue lookes, that thou wilt not aduiſe mee in any thing that ſhall not redound aſwell to my honour as to my profite. The whole company did wonderfully commend this cenſure of the prince, ſome noting his iuſtice, ſome his curteſie, ſome his liberality, others his clemency: but Corynus in this manner addreſſed his ſpéech. As your Graces authority to commaund, is full of vertue, wiſedome, and granity: ſo it belongs to me to obay with diligence, trueth, and fidelity, eſtéeming it much to my reputation to bee commaunded by your Grace, in whoſe procéedings there is ſo great a teſtimony of vertue: and becauſe to princes and great Lords, wée muſt miniſter our reaſons by weight, and giue our words by meſure: yet becauſe your wiſdome deemeth it ſo reaſonable to be aduertiſed, I beſéech you turne not that to preſumption that I ſhall preſent by duty and office, and if my wordes ſhall derogate in any thing from your honour▪ let my profeſſion ſuffer indignity, by which I hold the countenance of my reputation: and ſo I will wade no further in proteſtation, becauſe great offers are oftener performed in words than déeds.
            
            
               The eighteenth Chapter.
               
                  Doreſtus ſeeketh to deferre his eſtabliſhmente in the kingdome, Corynus aduiſeth him not to refuſe it.
               
               THeſe premiſes thus concluded, euerye man remained ſatisfied,
Doreſtus himſelfe excepted, whoſe minde was ſtill moleſted, with the memorie of his father, and whoſe ſpirites were dayly troubled with this that now inſueth. You haue partly heard that when Leonarchus was miſſing from the court, and that after all meanes of inquiry had béene made after him and could not yet be heard of, it was deſired by a generall requeſte, that Doreſtus (according to his right) ſhoulde preſently be crowned king, and although at that very inſtant it was deferred by Doreſtus, yet by their generall importunitie, he conſented within fiftéene daies to ſatisfie their deſires, to the which requeſt he the rather graunted for that hee
 hoped in the meane time to heare ſome newes of his father, thirtéene of the fiftéene daies are exſpired, & Doreſtus to giue a longer time, vſeth theſe wordes. O what truſt may be hoped for in this flattering worlde, whoſe cuſtome is with a little gold to mixe a greate deale of droſſe, vnder a reſemblance of trueth, it leades into many deceites: and to ouer fewe and ſhort delightes, it ioynes infinite griefes and diſpleaſures, to whome it ſhowes moſt fauoure, in him is moſt perril and deſtruction: and the alurements of the world are but baites to beguile ſuch as bite at them, when princes them ſelues are ſo farre deceiued, for where they are thought to haue open liberty, they are kept in ſecrete priſon: when it is thoughte they haue al things, alas they haue nothing: when they ar thought in greateſt ſafetie, then are they ſoneſt aſſaulted with perill: ſo that truly we may bouldly ſay, that he alone that is ſhut in the graue, is in ſafegarde from the vnconſtancy of fortune: conſider
(I beſeche you) my, cauſe of griefe, and if you ſhal find my complaintes to be more then ordinarie, you ſhall ſee the occaſion to be no leſſe then extreame: but haue your ſelues forgotten whome you haue loſt, remember, remember Leonarchus your king what he was towardes you, how mercifully he gouerned you, how fatherly he loued you, how carefully he preſerued you, and how cherely he cheriſhed you, and woulde you now with ſuch ſpeede eſtabliſhe an other in his place till it bee aſſuredly knowen what is become of himſelfe: O god forbid that either you ſhould be ſo vngratfull, or that Doreſtus ſhould be ſo vnnaturall, and if you ſhould thus forget your Prince, it might be thought you were more in loue with his fortune then with himſelfe, and a ſmall ſhowe of hearty good will whome you ſéemed ſo much to honour in his preſence, that you ſhoulde ſo ſodainely forget in his abſence: But if euer you loued your Prince now publiſhe your gratfulneſſe that it may bee ſéene to the worlde: and leaue off to make further requeſt in a matter that ſo much concerneth your owne reproch & my diſhonor.
Corynus, who onely adreſſed himſelfe to anſwere, ſaid as followeth: Although it might be deemed▪ a ſigne of little wit and great folly, for a man to anſwere ſudainely to euery propoſition, yet for as much as it hath pleaſed your grace to admit
 me to ſpeake, and remembring with what deuotion you requeſted me to doe it. I am bound in like affection, with all humility to obay you: It is not vnknowne vnto vs the cauſe you haue of griefe, but if you may lament the loſſe of a louing father, we haue no leſſe reaſon to ſorrowe for the want of a gratious ſoueraigne, yet ſeeing the chaunces of mortall creatures, do ſhewe that all men are ſubiect to the lawe of nature and fortune, and albeit (there is no doubt) but that your father might be a worthy prince, and there with al repleniſhed with euery condition appertaining to the vertue, and condition of a king, yet ſince in his creation he brought with him a ſubiection to worldly caſualtyes, I thinke your wiſedome is too much, to make that greuous to you, which nature ordaineth common to all, when there is nothing happened to your father, otherwiſe then god hath determined, who no ſooner had created his body, but he both directed the courſe of his life, and ordained the time of his death, for god hauing made all mortall things, hath authority to diſpoſe them, euen with the ſame power wherewith hee hath created them, reſeruing onely to himſelfe imortality, ſo that we muſt confeſſe, that all thinges are guided and gourned by the prouidence of god, who knoweth and ordereth caſuall thinges neceſſaryly, and although in your father there was fully filled, the patterne of a good prince, you can not in better ſort expreſſe your zeale, then to ſuffer god to haue his will without grudge, let my wordes therefore but intimate thus much, that as you cannot recall againe thoſe that be abſent, ſo you muſt not bee careleſſe of thoſe that be preſent, and as no man is bound to thoſe that are dead, yet euery man muſt giue ſuccours to them that are aliue: you are left heere the right inheritour to the crowne of Epirus, and by no other meanes then god himſelfe hath appointed, refuſe not then Doreſtus, that interceſſion of thy ſubiectes, which is ſo much deſired for their comfortes and thine honour.
            
            
               
               The nineteenth Chapter
               
                  Doreſtus what he replied, Corynus the merchant is become Leonarchus the king, the ioy that was made for his recouery
               
               
                  DOreſtus, that was little ſtirred in the winding vppe of this diſcourſe, briefly made this anſwere, doſt thou call it honour Corynus, to put my father from his crowne, he is vnworthy to haue honour, that by infamous meanes will ſeeke after it, and the child that will vniuſtly take his fathers honor, ought to looſe his life, but if thou hadeſt ſo great regard to thoſe vaine prehemineces or honorable dignities, lookd after by ambitious mindes, o how much ſhouldeſt thou haue reſpected mine honeſty, which is the very firſt ſtep (indeed) to win honour, and without the which wee can attaine to no better then vaine glory, which is but a falſe ſhadowe of true vertue, the liberty I gaue thée to ſpeake, contained things indifferent, neither vnmete to be required, nor worthy to be denaid, perſwading altogether to beare more reſpecte to my frendſhipe, then remembraunce to my calling: the which ſith thou haſt neglected, I doe once againe admoniſh thee heereafter to be more circumſpect, and as thou tendereſt my good will, to be better aduiſed what thou ſpeakeſt, Corynus immediately anſwered thus: Well Doreſtus if Leonarchus hath left thée a ſorrowfull ſonne, thou haſt made Leonarchus a moſt ioyfull father: then ſitting himſelfe downe in the ſeat of maieſtie, he further ſaid: it were but in vaine longer to conceale that, the knowledge whereof (I perceiue) would turne to ſo great comfort▪ Sée héere Doreſtus, the inſtabilitie of fortune, I was euen now a priſoner, then a Counſailer, nowe a king▪ and all at an inſtaunt. Doreſtus, who by this time had taken a better ſurnay of this counterfeit marchaunt, and hauing nowe gathered aſſured knowledge who it was, falling down on both his knées before him, he cried aloud, God ſaue Leonarchus, my moſt redoubted king and father: The reſt of the Nobility, with the whole aſſembly there preſent, altogether cried out, God ſaue the king, God ſaue the king: Doe you not thinke this ſodaine
 alteration bred as great admiration: yes I can aſſure you, and it likewiſe broght with it no leſſe contentation, for euery man reioyced in the recouery againe of their good king, but Bruſanus, both wondred and triumphed in his owne imagination, to ſée the accident how ſtrangly it fell out. Glorioſus amongeſt the reſt, ſéeing the marchant (whome hee had accuſed of treaſon) ſitting vnder the cloath of eſtate, and remembring otherwiſe howe hée had handled him in ſpeeches, was halfe out of loue with his owne wit: but after a conuenient pauſe, that ſilence was commaunded, the king in this wiſe beganne to diſcourſe.
            
            
               The twentith Chapter.
               
                  Leonarchus diſcourſeth what experience he hath gathered in his late traueiles, and firſt of the infections of his owne Court.
               
               AS it is the nature of vice, to put on a vizard, & to diſguiſe and couer it ſelfe with thoſe ſhewes that belong only vnto vertue and being thus clothed with the helpe of corruptible pleaſures, it yoaketh baſe minded men (whoſe care is 
                     〈…〉
                   ſet vpon the deſire of earthly thinges) which it preſenteth before their eies as their felicity, ſéeking to defend it ſelfe by reaſon, which although they bee altogether vaine and friuolous, yet of great waight, in regard of the weake fleſh of man, which eaſily ſuffereth it ſelfe to be a bondſlaue to ſinne: we are therefore to take good heed, that wee ſuffer not our ſelues to be ſurpriſed by ſo dangerous an enemie, nor to giue him any acceſſe or entrance into vs. To know then the cauſes of euils, is the readieſt way to cure them, for a diſeaſe known is halfe cured, and many kingdomes are brought to ruine by diuerſe cauſes, which if they were knowen to their princes and gouernours, they might eaſily be preuented by prouidence and reaſon. The prince that is carefull to ſee and enquire for the damages of his Realme, it may be ſaid (if he prouide not for them) that he can doe no more, but to him that is negligent to learne them (if he doe not prouide) it may be ſaid he will doe no more. This hath
 bene the cauſe that thus diſguiſed as you ſee, I haue traueiled through mine owne dominions to ſee the demeanures of my ſubiects, that by gathering a platforme of common report, I might be the better able to reform a common miſchiefe: for the ſureſt Counſailers that belongeth to a prince, be his own eies and his eares, which muſt bee alwaies vigilaunt: and it is not decent, that Princes ſhould be Lordes ouer many, and ſhould communicate priuately but with few. By my traueile in the Countrey I haue bettered my experience, to learne the follies of mine owne Court, and omitting to ſpeake of many alterations, I will but onely glaunce at the ſuperfluitie of this our preſent age, wherein al kind of exceſſe, riot, weltering in pleaſures, curioſitie in apparell, perfumes, friſling of haire, not vſed ſo much amongſt women, as practiſed daily amongſt vaine men. Should I ſpeake here what intemperance is vſed in diet what curious diſhes deuiſed for appetite: nay, what filthy conceits to prouoke beaſtly deſire, what ſeuerall ſortes of cates to furniſh forth a banket, what exces & ſuperfluity, both in meats and drinks, it were to much for me to tel, and to ſhamefull for you to heare. In the firſt ages, the Hebrues vſed to eate but once a day, which was at diner, ſo the Gretians vſd but only to ſup, for this cauſe wee read, that Plato being demaunded whether he had ſeene any ſtrange thinge in Sicilia, anſwered hee had found a monſter in diet, which did eate twice a day, happy then might thoſe daies be accounted, that eſteemed not of any thinge more then was needefull, but where as wee haue but hitherto looked into the vanity of their attire, and the curioſity in their diets, with their externall follies, let vs nowe but a little conſider of the inward diſpoſition of their minds, and we ſhal find that the whol ſort of them are deſirous of reputation, but by what meanes doe they ſpeake it, by flattering of Princes, by ſoothing of great men, by pleaſeing of humors, by carrieng of newes, and other like ſeruile demeanures, not fit for an honeſt minde to apply it ſelfe vnto, true honour (indeed) is by no other meanes to bee atchiued, then by vertuous indevoures: As for thoſe honours that depend vppon the bare oppinion of Princes as they take their begining without deſert, ſo they haue their ending againe at an inſtant: But as I haue
 gathered by this ſouldier Martianus, (in a diſcourſe that hee made, before wee came to this place) Princes that are conſtrained to relye on other mennes reportes, muſt vſe greate diligence, to diſcerne flatterers, and diſguiſers of matters, and muſt likewiſe vſe no leſſe circumſpection, in beſtowing of offices, and giuing rewardes: Princes many times giues preferment to their frendes to recompence their frendſhip, other whiles to their ſeruantes to requite their ſeruices, and although it might bee ſaid that many Princes doe erre in diſtributing their offices, yet they doe not erre, for that they would erre, yea, and many times it is ſeene in caſes of promotion, high offices and dignities are rather bought with money, then deſerued by vertue: where in time paſt, there was no man areared to honour, but hee that deſerued it: In former adges, men ofſcience were ſearched for in ſtrang countries, but now, though they knocke at our gates, they are not ſuffered to enter, no our corruption and cuſtome drawes vs to other delightes: This court in elder adge was counted a receptacle of wiſe men, but nowe the common harbour for paraſites and flatterers, but as no vermine breedes where they find no warmth, no vultures ſtoope where they ſmell no pray, no flies ſwarme where they ſée no fleſhe, no pilgrime creepes where there is no croſſe, ſo there is no paraſit will lurke where hee findes no gaine, and therefore doe flatterers praiſe vs, bycauſe they would price vs, but I wonder that theſe great men that haue authority in the courtes of Princes ſhould bee ſo generally ſeduced by flatterers, and ſo vſually carried awaye, by theſe creeping paraſites: But beinge inſtructed as I am, I doubte not but ere manye daies paſt, I will ſo ſcoure that rable from out of this courte, that they ſhal be glad to ſeeeke a newe haunte: Pretermitting many other follies entertained in the courte, I will conclude with this example vſed by Alexander Seuerus as a cauiat to courtiers. This good Emperour hauing a ſeruant, whome he much fauored, but he abuſing, his maiſters curtiſie tooke great bribes of poore ſuters promiſing them to be-friende them in their requeſtes: but the Emperour binding him to a poſt, cauſed him to be chooked with ſmoke, making proclamation, that
 they that ſell ſmoke, ſhould dye with ſmoke. If all the ſmoke ſellers in euery Princes courte were thus rewarded, and all the parraſites in like manner baniſhed, I thinke the courtes of Princes would not be ſo fully repleniſhed, nor euery greatman ſo mightily followed.

                  The King proceedeth in his diſcourſe, what vices he hath noted in the countrie.
               
               BUt do you thinke that where the court is thus infected with vices, that the country is not ſpiced with the ſame infirmities▪ O yes you may be ſure, and mine owne eies hath béene witneſſes of many miſdemeanurs: I haue ſene many men liue idlely and ſo vtterly vnprofitable, ſome others neither idle nor yet well occupied, and therefore not ſufferable, and what vſury doth abound in the Citie, what extortion & couetous hourding both in towne & countrie, what pride and ambition in the layty, what ſimmony and heaping of benefices in the clargy, what plaintes at the barre, what delaies on the benche, what malice to thoſe that be good, what boulſtering of thoſe that be ill, what lacke of loue in thoſe that bee riche, and what oppreſſion of the miſerable poore. This I ſay I haue ſéene, and ſome thinges your ſelues haue hearde by complainte of this pooreman, Caſtus, the maieſtrat that we haue appointed to execute iuſtice▪ the lawyer that by profeſſion ſhoulde bee a miniſter of right; the one of them is become negligent, the other careleſſe, both corrupt and ſubiecte to lucre: they refuſe nothing that is giuen them openly, the bribe is as much as they can do ſecretly, they greuouſly puniſh the offences of the poore, they cloſelye diſſemble the faultes of the riche, and without a

                     〈…〉
                   iudge: Cicero complained of his time, that many notable decrees of lawes were corrupted and depraued by the curicus heades of lawyers: what woulde he do if he were nowe aliue and ſawe the lawyers ſo vilie poluted, where a thouſand cauiles and quidittes are continually coyned. Gainefull to
 wicked and faithles men that ſéekes nothing but deceite, and very preiudiciall to good men, who manye times had rather looſe their right, then vndo them ſelues by following with ſuch delaies, and ſo longe time by way of iuſtice. To the end therefore, that the diſorders whereby all theſe vices haue béene brought into the coinmen wealthe, may be plucked vp by the rootes: let vs all ſet to our handees, that the entrance maye bee ſhut vp againſt the wicked who are the noriſhers of all this corruption: for mine owne parte, you ſhall ſée me ſoe prouide, that this ſale of offices ſhall be aboliſhed, that both iudgment and iuſtice, ſhall be better executed: and that the auntient and happy ordinaunces of our predeceſſors, ſhall be reſtored: Now touchinge the complaintes of my late accuſation, I meane
Martianus and Caſtus my fellowe priſoners: what hath béene awarded in their behalfe I doe here ratefie, with a beneuolence of a thouſand crownes to be deuided betwéene them out of mine owne treaſure. For thee Glorioſus, that haſt accuſed me of treſon, in whome I haue found more maieſtie then good manners, more grauity then wit, more prattell then proofe, yet for that there is nothing beſéeming a Prince, to giue place to any wronges, than to thoſe that are done to his owne perſon: and as thoſe men are moſt vnworthy their ſcepters, who cruelly reuenge their owne iniuries, and pardon ſuche as are done to others: I doe here fréely forgiue thee for all manner of treſpaſſes that thou haſt committed againſte my ſelfe: but for the iniurie thou haſt done to theſe other two, by the wrongfull charging them with a falſe accuſation; I doe heere preſentlye baniſhe thee the courte, charging thee heare-after not to come within three leagues, vntill thou haſt reformed thy ſelfe, in all thy demeanures, manners and conditions.
            
            
               The two and twentieth Chapter.
               
                  How Bruſanus was entertained by the Kinge Leonarchus, and after ſome pleaſante time ſpent in the courte, Bruſanus and Doreſtus betooke them-ſelues to trauaill.
               
               THeſe thinges thus performed the people altogether fell into a generall commendation of their kinge, praiſing him to
 be ſo gentell in conuerſation, ſoe patient in iniuries, ſo thankefull of benifites, ſo good to the good, ſo ſeuere to the ill, that the king acknowledging their faithfull loue, thanking them for their obedience, diligence and ſeruice, he ariſing from his ſeate, and taking Bruſanus in his armes aſſured him to be as heartelye welcome to the King Leonarchus, as euer hee had bene before to the marchaunt Corynus: thus accompanied with Bruſanus, Doreſtus, and the reſt of his Nobility, hée departed to the Court, where he cauſed a moſt ſumptuous lodgeing to be made ready for Bruſanus: hee then proclaimed a generall feaſt▪ and to be continued for twenty daies: in the mean time, the people had prepared theaters, ſcaffoulds, & ſtandings, wheron there was ſometimes preſented Commedies, Hiſtories, and other rare inuentions: other whiles againe the Tilt was frequented, by many braue couragious knights, ſo ſtrong and gallantly armed, as might haue bene iudged that they did rather prepare to incampe themſelues for warre, then to ſhew knightly exerciſes but in ſporte or pleaſure. Bruſanus and
Doreſtus, beeing nowe growen to a mutuall loue, and both of them deſirous to approoue their owne vallour, came into the liſtes amongſt the reſt gallantly mounted, and moſt richly armed.
Bruſanus carrying for his deuice in a field azure, Cupid, with both his armes faſt pinioned like a malefactor, his bowe and arrowes broken, his worde was Inuidia Amoris▪ Doreſtus had for his deuiſe in a field argent, the flying Daphne, in the figure of a Lawrell, and the wiſe Apollo purſuing Caſſandria: his woorde was Amorvincit omnia: the one of them ſo quite contrarie to the other, the which although it fell out by aduenture, yet ſure it did preſage the ſequell of that which was to follow.
               I doe not meane to ſette you downe the ſundrye exployts perfourmed by theſe two gallant Princes: let this ſuffiſe, they continually caried away the prize, to their great commendacion, and to no leſſe wonder to as many as did beholde them, to ſée ſo braue incounters againſt ſo many hardy knights that were ſo well approoued, and of ſo long experience. The perfourmance of theſe noble exploytes, did ſo imbou
                     ••••
                   them in their couragious deſire, as loathing to ſpende their lives in
 safe or ſlouthfull idlenes, & more and more deſirous to increaſe their vertues and experience, determined both together to leue the Court of Epirus, and to traueile through the world to ſéeke knightly aduentures: with this reſolution they came vnto the king, crauing his allowance in their determinations: the which at the firſt, although it were very gréeuous vnto him, yet to appeaze their hautie deſires, and hoping to beguile his penſiue thoughts, with the memorie of their worthy acts, hee graunted to their requeſts. There is no more now to bee done, but for the princes to prepare themſelues with neceſſaries fit for their iourney, and becauſe they are now making of their prouiſion, I thinke it beſt for a little ſpace to leaue them about their buſineſſe, when they are ready to ſet forward, you ſhall aſwell vnderſtand of that, as of the reſt of their fortunes what happens vnto them in their traueile.

                  THeſe two princes wer long in prouiding themſelues, and now being ready, they were as long in taking of their leaue, and bidding their friends fare-well: but hauing accompliſhed all things neceſſarilie, they take their iourny, and paſſing through Phrigia, Miſina, Leodicia, aud
Pannouia, they came to Illeria: And although I poſt them thus haſtely on their way, you muſt imagine they tooke more leaſure, and perfourmed ſo many commendable exploits in their traueile, that the report of their honourable actions, had a through recourſe, euen amongeſt all Nations and kingdomes in that part of the worlde. There raigned now in Illeria, a mightie Prince called by the name of Aſtulpho, who through his proweſſe in all martiall exploites, waxed ſo proud and tyrannous, vſing ſuch mercileſſe crueltie to his forraine enemies, and ſuch moodleſſe rigour to his natiue ſubiectes, that it was doubtfull whether hee were more feared of his foes for his cruelty, or hated of his friendes for his tyrannie: yet as the worſt weed ſpringeth vppe more
 brauelie then the holſomeſt hearbe, and as the crookedſt tree, is commonly loaden with moſt fruite: ſo this rigorous king, was foſtered vp with great fortune, his eſtate eſtabliſhed with no leſſe worldly honour, indued hee was with woonderfull wealth, and fortunate againe with the like proſperity, but moſt happieſt of all, in a ſonne and a daughter: the ſonne called by the name of Antipholus, a moſt gallant young Prince, loued for his curteſie, reuerenced for his vertue, and honoured for both, and the heire apparant to the Crowne of Illeria. The daughter called by name Moderna: in demeanure decent, in countenance ſo ſweet, in face ſo amiable, in body ſo comely, in all her parts ſo proportionable, that nature might not poſſibly affoord more beautie in any creature, nor art ſupply any defect in nature. Beſides all theſe exquiſite perfections, ſhe was the inheritrix to the kingdome of Dalmatia, by the right of her mother called Perſida, the onely daughter and heire to Vrbanus, the late king of Dalmatia, who before his death, gaue his laid daughter Perſida vnto Aſtulpho for a ſecond wife, aſſuring for her dowry (after his deceaſe) the kingdome of Dalmatia to Aſtulpho during his life, and ſo to the heires of his body begotten of his daughter Perſida, of whome Aſtulpho had no other iſſue but onely Moderna, at whoſe birth Perſida died in childebed, ſo leauing the inheritaunce of the kingdome to Moderna, who although ſhe were but the halfe ſiſter to Antipholus, yet nature in reſpect of the Symphatie of their mindes, ſeemed to haue planted but one and the ſelfe ſame heart, they ſo intirelie loued the one of them the other.
               Theſe two Princes beeing thus come vnto the Illerian Courte, were verie well welcomed by the King Aſtulpho, but moſt kindlie entertained by the Prince Antipholus; and although the honourable exploites of theſe two gallant Princes was reported in the court of Illeria, longe after their perſonall ariuall, which won the hearers to loue them before euer they ſaw them, yet now ſuch heroycall greatnes ſhewed in their eies, ſuch extraordinary maieſty in all their actions, but eſpecially the goodly preſence of Bruſanus (in whome ſuch true valiaunce ſhined) bred a delight full admiration to all beholders, and now inſinuating themſelues into the ſocrety of the
 gallant courtiers, they proued to bee in ſport ſo pleaſaunt, in talke ſo witty, in manners ſo modeſt, in conceytes ſo cunning, in parle ſo pithy, and in all their conuerſation ſo comely, that they were generally liked of all, and for a time there was no other talke in the court, but in the commendation of the two Princes: But Bruſanus beſides the beautie of his body, had ſuch a naturall dexterity in all thinges, as in feates of armes who more hardy, in any excerciſe of the body, who more actiue, in communication or any diſcourſe, who more pleaſant, and in all manner of companies who better eſteemed, ſo that there was no perſon, time, or place, wherevnto hee aptly applied not himſelfe, inſomuch that the familiaryty betwéene himſelfe and Antipholus, did more and more exceed, and it fortuned that Moderna caſting a glaunce, vppon the beautie of Bruſanus felt a certaine alteration in her affections, and as it were a ſudaine aſſault within her ſelfe, but hauing ſmall practiſe in the prankes of loue, ſhee could not coniecture the ſecret cauſe of theſe her ſudaine paſſyons, thinking it to be but some toy lightly taken, and would be againe as ſudainly left, and vppon this ſhe ſtill reſted her ſelfe, conceiuing yet a good likeing towardes Bruſanus, Doreſtus on the other ſide hauing eſpied Moderna accompanied with other Ladies, walking in the fieldes to take the aire, contemplating himſelfe in the perfection of her beautie, hee was taken priſoner before hee had leiſure to arme himſelfe, but loe how occaſion offered it ſelfe to a further miſchiefe: Bruſanus and Doreſtus were inuited
(amongſt many other) to a banquet prepared by Moderna, there was likewiſe her brother the Prince Antipholus, with many other Lordes and Ladies of the court.

                  The perplexity of Doreſtus for the loue of Moderna, the like of Moderna for the loue of Bruſanus.
               
               DƲring the time of this banquet, Doreſtus being placed right ouer againſt Moderna, and taking a better views of this perfect bloſſome of beauty, this matchleſſe parragon for
 perſonage, perfited by nature, and poliſhed by nurture he was ſo fettered in the ſnare of fancy, his fancy ſo intangled in the trap of affecting, that his onely bleſſe, pleaſure, ioy, and delight was in contemplating his eies on the heauenly face of this Goddeſſe, but alas her beauty bred his bane, her lookes his loſſe, her ſight his ſorrowe, her exquiſit perfections, his extreame paſſions: Bruſanus in this meane time now and then enterlarding the diſhes with pleaſant diſcourſe, was throughlye ſurueyd by Moderna, whoe marking his manners, and muſing at his modeſtye, notinge his excellent courteſye, and wondering at his exquiſit beautie, was ſo inflamed with frendly affection towardes this yonge Prince, that where before ſhe eſteemed her likeing to be but the frutes of her gentle nature, ſhe now gaue free ſcoape to thoſe ſweete thoughts, which by this had taken the ful poſſeſſion of her harte: The banquete once ended, and euery one departed, Moderna ſhutting her ſelfe into her Chamber, diſcourſed thus: alaſſe poore Moderna, how art thou bewitched where is thy wonted vertue, haſt thou prepared a banquet to intrap thy ſelfe with a more delicate diſh, then any thou didſt prouide? haſt thou laid a bait, and thy ſelfe poyſoned with the bane? haſt thou bid him welcome, that hath caught thee captiue. Bluſh Moderna at thy Fortune, thy thoughts, thy choice, thy loue cannot be vttered without ſhame, nor thy affections without diſcredite. But ah Bruſanus, ah ſwéete Bruſanus, thy beauty Bruſanus: but peace
Moderna, blab not out that which thou maieſt bee aſhamed to reueale vnto thy ſelfe: but thou dooſt loue Moderna, yea, and whome? a ſtraunger Prince, ſtragled out of his owne Countrey, beautifull enough, but yet perhaps not ſtaied in minde, and therefore not fit for thée to fancie. Ceaſe then Moderna, to looke at Bruſanus, much leſſe to loue him: be not ouer-taken with theſe diſſembling men, whoſe eies are framed by art to allure. Die thē 
                  Moderna, Moderna die: better were it for thée to periſh with high deſires, then to liue in baſe thoughts: thus throwing her ſelfe vpon her bed, drawing the Curtaines, ſhee turned too and fro, as if ſhee would haue hidden her ſelfe from her owne thoughts. Doreſtus againe who was departed from the banquet, with a new field of fancies traueiling in his mind,

                   went directly to his chamber, and making faſt the dore, began in this ſort to diſcourſe. Ah Doreſtus, art thou alone? O no, not alone, when thou art accompanied with ſo many vnacquainted paſſions: alaſſe, what helliſh hagge doth poſſeſſe thée, or what frantique furie doth inchaunt thée, that ſo ſodainly thy mind is perplexed with ſuch ſeuerall paſſions? alate frée, now fettered: alate ſwimming in reſt, nowe ſincking in care: ere while in ſecurity, nowe in captiuitie. Ah Moderna, thy courtlie Maieſtie without coyneſſe, thy perfect beautie without blemiſhe, thy comely demeanure without curioſitie, thy ſweete and pleaſaunt ſpeeches ſeaſoned with witte, thy decent mirth tempered with modeſtie: It is thou, it is thou, that haſt thus charmed me, it is thy beauty that hath bewiched me. But I will loue, nay I muſt loue, and I will obay becauſe I muſt obay; ye & beauty muſt be obayd, becauſe it is beauty, and framed it was of the gods to féedthe eie, but alas it formenteth the hearte. O loue, O deuine loue, feared of men, becauſe honoured of the gods, not to bee ſuppreſſed by wiſdome, becauſe not to be comprehended by reaſon, without lawe, and therefore aboue all lawe, But how now Doreſtus, doeſt thou blaze that with praiſe which thou ſhouldeſt rather condemne with diſgrace, or wilt thou ſéeme to bleſſe, where thou haſt cauſe to curſſe, and why ſhoulde I curſe loue that am in loue, the gods diſdained not to loue, Iupiter loued Io, and why ſhoulde not I then loue Moderna: Doreſtus, loue her, and in the contemplations let this be reſerued in thy praiers, that it wold pleaſe the gods to graunte Moderna to bee ſtill faire, neuer adged and
Doreſtus to loue aſſuredly, and to continue conſtant: with this reſolution, he bound himſelfe within the limittes of his owne chamber, ſuffering no other thoughtes to haue familiaritie within his braines, but that which preſented vnto him the picture of his beloued.

                  Bruſanus cometh to viſit Doreſtus in his lodging, Doreſtus maketh him aquainted with his loue towardes Moderna.
               
               
                  BRuſanus, that could not ioy out of the companie of his deareſt friend Doreſtus, and meruailing to finde him ſoe obſtinent
 from wonted exerciſes, that was accuſtomed to be ſo forwarde in all manner of commendable indeuours, comming to his chamber, where he found him by himſelfe he ſaide. I haue found in you (worthy Prince Doreſtus) a greate ſlacking of your wonted vertues, & you ſubiecte your ſelfe to ſolitarineſſe, the very enimie to nature it ſelfe, and the onely hinderance of all good exerciſes: neither careing for companye to ſolace your ſadnes, nor accuſtoming your ſelfe to thoſe delightes that whylome wonne you commendation, which maketh the Gentlemen of the courte to imagin they knowe not what. Doreſtus, although he knewe his owne fault, yet deſirous for a time to conceale his loue: made this aunſwere. I know not (my good
Bruſanus) what it pleaſeth the Gentlemen of the courte to ſurmiſe by my ſolitarines, neither woulde I wiſhe them to impute it to any coy or curious ſtatelines that is in me, for in ſo doing they ſhoulde do me wronge to coniecture of my diſeaſe before they haue caſt my water. But this ſolitarines (ſaide
Bruſanus) cannot frée you from ſuſpition, nor defend you from melancoly, being thus alone by your ſelfe: and reſpecting our vnder-taken attempt, is it not time that we leaue the Illerian courte, proſecuting our Iournye as wee firſte pretended:
Doreſtus who all this while hadde hys mynde fixed on an other deuotion, hearing Bruſanus to ſpeake of leauing the
Illerian court, gaue a ſudaine ſtart at the very word, breathing out a pitious ſighe, anſwered thus: O Bruſanus, doth not the pleaſure of the court render ſufficient recompence for our time ſpent in it, me thinkes your very eies ſhould receiue ſuch contentment, that you ſhoulde not ſeeke nowe to depart, when your onely counſaile may worke my greater reliefe, then mine owne reaſon is able to render: Behold Bruſanus, I doe challeng that curteſie at thy handes which erſt thou dideſt promiſe with thy hart, in perfourmance whereof thou ſhalt eaſe ſome part of my ſorrowe, and proue thy ſelfe faithfull to thy frend, theſe ſpeeches he deliuered with a geſture gouerned by the force of his paſſions, thus ended his diſcourſe liſtining what Bruſanus would anſwere, who noting his words ſpoken with ſuch vehemency, did rather increaſe newe doubtes, then giue him ground to ſettell any iudgment, but yet wonderfully
 diſmaid, to ſée this alteration in him whom he ſo dearly loued, made this anſwrere. Where in may Bruſanus ſteede you, that you may not commaund him, but the manner of your ſpéeches are ſo ſtraung vnto me, as I knowe not where in I may pleaſure you nor what I ſhould anſwere you: Ah Bruſanus
(ſaid Doreſtus) if the violence of loue haue euer taken hold of you, I hope my caſe ſhall neuer want pitie in your conſideration, you would haue me leaue this court, but alas I am ſo ſurely fettred that I can not away, you would haue me frée, that am already ſo impriſoned as there is no other redreſſe to purchaſe liberty, but onely by her mercy that hath caught me captiue: Moderna, Bruſanus Moderna, ah Moderna (without ſuperſtition be it ſpoken) is the adored gooddeſſe of my amorous deuotions, the emperious miſtris of my martired hart, whoſe beautie is my bliſſe, whoſe ſweete countenaunce, is my ſoule comfort, to whome more then to my ſelfe, I onely deſire to liue.
            
            
               The fourth Chapter.
               
                  Bruſanus perſwadeth Doreſtus to ſhake off his fits of loue, Doreſtus reſolueth to ſubmit himſelfe a priſoner to loue and beautie.
               
               
                  BRuſanus, who by this time had ſounded the very deapth of his intention, both what hee ſaid, and with what minde hee ſpake it, was ſtricken into a ſodaine amazement, but immediatly recouering his ſpirites, he ſaid: Is this Doreſtus the onely yong prince of the world, noted for his vertue, that ſo ſodainlie ſhould martch vnder the banner of Venus, the very firſt down ſtep to all griefe and ſorrowe. O Feminine loue, what power holdeſt thou in mens hearts, being (indéed) ſo far off from loue, that I rather think it a doating frenzie, rouing headlong vpon impoſſibilities, ingendred indéede betwixt luſt and idlenes, his aſſociates & chiefeſt companions, are pain, trauel, anger, rage, furie, dout, grief, languiſh, threatning, diſpair, vncertaine hope, his ſureſt good, a certaine baſe weaknes, his fruits are laborſome aduentures, nay, rather lothſome miſaduentures, which
 either wil bring forth il ſucceſſe, or no ſucceſſe: ſo conclude, loue is in nothing more conſtant, then in tormenting his profeſſors.O remēber your ſelfe then Doreſtus, if not for my ſake that am ſory to ſée your paſſions, yet for your owne ſake, that euen now remains in ieoperdy: purge your head of this infection, weaue not the webbe of your own woe, ſpinne not the thread of your owne thraldome, it is better to beware by others miſhappes, then by repentaunce of your owne follies: hazard not at that which cannot be had without harme, ſtretch not too farre, wade not too deepe, vſe beauty but ſerue it not, taſt wine but ſurfeit not, warme thée by the fire but burne thée not. Take héed therfore, and dwell nor long in this temptation, when it is neither conuenient for your honour, your body, nor your profite. Doreſtus that was ſtrucken in a dumpe with theſe admonitions, anſwered againe. You handle me Bruſanus, as a crabbed mother, that when her childe hath caught a fall, ſhee whippes the taile to make amendes, but if you finde your ſelfe an Apoſtata to loue, or that you haue diſplaied the flagge of defiance againſt fancie: can you not vſe your liberty to your ſelfe, but you muſt vſe it, as if you would vantingly martch ouer your frends miſerie: O Bruſanus, things are ſone promiſed, but not ſo haſtelie perfourmed, it is eaſie to ſound the victorie, but very hard to obtaine the conqueſt: all can ſay we would ouer-come, but few or none returne with triumph. Loue is a God and will be obaid, and lookes to command, not to be conquered, and beautie cannot be reſiſted: dare reaſon abide the brunt, wher beautie bids the battell, can wiſedome winne the fielde, where loue commaunds as captaine? O no, no: loue is without lawe, and therefore aboue all lawe: honoured in heauen, feared in earth, and a very terrour to infernal ghoſts. Lord how wiſe you be
(anſwered Bruſanus) in framing propoſitions to deceiue but your ſelfe: if loue be lawleſſe (as you infer) it is lewd: if without limites, laſciuious: if contained within no bounds, beaſtlie: if obſerued with no order, odious: ſo that lawleſſe loue without reaſon, is the very loadſtone to ruth and ruine. Howe can you then imagine the effect to bee good, when the ſubiect is naught, or howe canne you ſo clearkely defend your deſperate motion, proceeding from ſuche a fond and fooliſhe occaſion: But you
 will ſaye it was the perfection of her comelye perſon, her exquiſite feature and rare beauty that kynd led your deſire. But remember Doreſtus, beauty no ſoner ſloriſheth, but it as quickly fadeth, it is not fully ripe, before it begin to rot: it is no ſoner out of the budde, but it withereth in the bloſſome. If then beauty be ſo fading, ſo fickle, ſo momentarie, ſo withering, ſo wauing, ſone paſſed and ſoe ſone parched, is this the Iewell that you make ſoe deare off, is this the Iemme that you would purchaſe with ſo great daunger, conſider againe, al beautifull thinges are not precious, Mercury is milke white, but deadly poyſon: the gloworme, is bright in the hedge, but blacke in the hande, the Panther hath a painted ſkin, but a deuouring paunche: the Serpent is pleaſing to the eye, but peſtilent to al our other partes: and he that taketh to much delight to gaze on beauty, ſhall ſometimes bee gauled with to much griefe. Yet I ſay not nay, but that loue may haue a certaine childiſhe vehemency: but if louers were not charmed with ſome ſecret inchauntment, they would be able either to kéepe their fancies for being inflamed, or elſe to coole deſire being alreadie blinded: for the daies they ſpende in thoughtes the nightes in dreames, both in griefes, either beguylinge them of that they had, and promiſing, that they are neuer like to finde: their heades fraught with fantiſies, fixed with ieloſies, troubled with both: yea ſo many inconueniences waite vpon loue, as were infinit to recken them all, and to much intolerable
(for a reſonable man) to taſt but one: being alwaies begun with griefe, continued with ſorrowe, and ended with deathe: and albeit the pleaſure paſſeth away in a triſe, no ſoner done but forgotten, and the puniſhmente is permanent, yet ſo delightfull is the preſent ſwéete, that they neuer remember the following ſoure. The time is yet to com wherein many thorns are not founde amidſt the roſes of mariage. Marius the Romaine, aſked Metellus why he would not take his daughter to wife, ſéeing ſhe was beautifull in body, ſtaide in countenance, eloquent in ſpeach, noble by race, riche in doury, happy in good name and adorned with ſundry vertues: to whome the other replide that he knew all this to be true, yet (quoth he) I had rather bee mine owne then hers. An other good fellowe on a
 time, aduiſed his friend not to marrye his ſon before hee were wiſe: (was thus aunſwered) be not deceiued my friend (quoth the other) if my ſon once grow to be wiſe, he will neuer marry: nowe Doreſtus if you had a will that inticed you to loue, recouer now a wit to ſe the error in loue, better counſaill can you not haue, more holſom aduiſe I cannot giue, if you cary an obſtinat eare, you hurt but your ſelfe, if you accept of my curtiſie I profer it friendly, if you take it as I meane it, you will followe it willingly. Doreſtus that ſtood all this while with a flea in his eare, at laſt made aunſwere. I ſe Bruſanus, that loue and beautye are little beholding to you but that eye that loatheth to behold beauty, is vnworthy to contemplate the heauens: what appetite more earneſtly to be ſought after then beauty, which conceiueth no blemiſh and concerneth the light of the body. But fortune I now moſt humbly thanke thee, for the recomforting mee with the delightfull remembrance of the beauty of my miſtris, making me pertaker of that contemplation which is heauenly: the memorie whereof is a preſent reſtoritiue to all incumbrances that you haue hetherto feared me with, and a ſufficient defenſatiue, to any misfortune, that can heere-after befall me: but it is againſt reaſon Bruſanus, ſo vncharitably to exclaime againſt thoſe, without whome our life though neuer ſo luckie ſhould ſéeme moſt loathſome, and ſo preiudicially to contemne thoſe heuenly creatures, whoſe onely ſight is a ſalue againſt all helliſhe ſorrowes: If thou dideſt knowe Bruſanus, the ioy, the comforte, and recreation that is conuerſante with beautye, thou wouldeſt doe pennance and marter thy ſelfe, for abuſing ſo high an eſtate as Cupid is. Truely (quoth Bruſanus) thou art worthy Doreſtus to be a chapman, that will bid ſo well for thy chaffer: But I would mine owne experience had neuer ſerued me to iudge ſo well of wemens manners, that ſomtimes adicted my ſelfe wholy to their ſeruice, and ſpent my life in the lappes of Ladies, waſting my goods to maintaine their brauery, and my wit to follow their folly. Oh howe curious haue I beene to pleaſe my Lady, but how careleſſe to ſerue my Lord, O that I had bene more carefull in avoiding wemens company, and leſſe cunning in diſciphering their vanity: But if beauty be the marke
 that you ſhoote at Doreſtus, take heede, for many vices of the mind, are couered vnder this vaile of beautie, & it hath brought commodity to very fewe, but they are not to bee numbered, that it hath brought to vtter diſtruction: O ſhunne Doreſtus, ſhunne I ſay this ſugered miſchiefe, be not longer obſtinat, let not your vertues decreaſe, ſhake of this collor of incumberance, be not ſubiected by loue, nor ſeduced by luſt, no erroure ſhall then miſlead you, no fooliſh fancy ſhall feed you, no woman ſhall beſotte you, no vice ſhall withdrawe you, no glaring beautie ſhall intice you, and what knowledge but ſhall ſerue you: Doreſtus that had his mind trauelled with two extreame paſſions, the one of loue towardes his miſtris, the other of griefe to heare theſe wordes of Bruſanus, after he had a while chafed to himſelfe, he mildly made this anſwere: It is pitie Bruſanus, that wit ſhould be no better imploied, then in the contempt of beautie, the diſpraiſe of loue, the diſpite of women, and in the diſparagement of their honours, but I cannot ſo lightly bee induced, to miſlike of that ſex of whome I was borne, of whome I receiued life, by whome I haue bin nurſed and charely brought vppe, and wemen are framed of nature, with as great perfections of the mind, for the exerciſe of vertue, as men, but what ſoeuer fall out▪ I am fully reſolued in my ſelfe, either to win the ſpurres or looſe the horſe, to haue the bloſſome or looſe the frute, to inioy the beautie of
Moderna, or to ieoperd my beſt ioynt, and therefore, what ſo euer the learninge willes, I will conſent to nature, what ſo euer the lawes of philoſophy perſwades me, I will at this time giue the raines of liberty to my amorous paſſions, and what ſo euer be the chaunce, I will caſt at all, God ſend you good fortune (ſaid Bruſanus) but I feare me it will neuer be in loue: By this time the yoonge Prince Antipholus was come to the chamber dore, calling both Bruſanus and Doreſtus, to walke out, and to vſe ſome exerciſe vntill it were ſupper time, to the which Bruſanus willingly agreed, but Doreſtus framing a ſlight excuſe remained ſtill in his chamber, & being thus alone, he recalled to his mind the ſeuerall ſpéeches paſt betweene Bruſanus and himſelfe, and now hauing better leaſure to conſider of euery circumſtaunce, reſolued not ſo
 ſlightly to let paſſe the reaſons of Bruſanus, but like a champion in the defence of women, takeing pene, incke and paper, thus he writeth.

               THe phyloſophers (Bruſanus) amongſt their preſeptes of good counſailes, were accuſtomed very bitterly to reprehend the bouldnes of the tongue: this well conſidered, were ſufficient to condemne your bitter inuectiues, ſeeking to bereue vs of that comfort, without the which the depopulation of the world would followe, you diſpraiſe women, who at the firſt were created by the almighty himſelfe to be a helper vnto man, doth it not then followe that as the creator, is more worthy they ye things created, thā the helper ſhould in like manner be of greater moment then the matter holpen: The better to confirme our argument and to proue women the more perfet creature, let vs conſider of the ſubſtaunce whereof ſhe was created: It cannot be denaid, but mettal the oftner it is fined, the purer it is made, then is it not as certaine, that man being framed of the duſt of the earth, & was yet made good, that woman being drawne from metall thus alreadie purified, ſhould be a great deale the better: heere is nowe to be conſidered, the goodnes of the creator, that hauing framed a paterne of ſuch perfection, would cuple her as a companion to vnthankefull man, whoſe proud nature, not able to brooke equality, hath euen from that time, vntill this very inſtant, ſought to raigne ouer wemen, with an vſurped prerogatiue, and to eclips their vertues, with ſlaunderous and falſe reportes: it might haue pleaſed god euen then to haue cupled man to a lion, to a tiger, to a ſerpent, or ſome other ſuch, but he linked him to a womā, he gaue man a woman to be a comfort vnto him, to the intent therefore, and the rather that man ſhould bee induced to their imbracementes, hath not nature adorned them with perfection
 of beautie, delicacy of bodye, excelency of wit, and ſuch ſweetnes in al their demeanures, that men of any iudgement, and able to diſcerne of ſuche ineſtimable riches, doe they not whet their wittes, their willes, their tongues and all their whole inuentions, howe to comprehend their fauour, and to inſinuate themſelues into their grace: yea they doe adde increaſe of courage to men of little hardines, making them to be more valiaunt and venturous in armes, to bee briefe they are the very pictures of comelines, the veſſeles of ſobriety the ornaments of beautie, and the very images of continency modeſty & vertue, whoſe natural property (in any iniury done them) is either to excuſe or to pardon: and heere making a ſparing concluſion of their vnſpeakable commendations, let me perſwade thée Bruſanus, to leaue thy miſdéeming of ſo pretious a treaſure, for whom we are borne, & not for our ſelues, & by whome we are againe reuiued in our poſterity, & not of our ſelues: Doreſtus, hauing finiſhed this diſcourſe, ſealing it vppe in the manner of a Letter, ſent it the next day to Bruſanus, who peruſing the contents, and hauing with Euripides, proclaimed himſelfe an open enemy to woman-kinde, hee determined to ſtand faſt by his takling, and to ſend Doreſtus ſuch an anſwer, as he ſhould not eaſily be able to auoyd: and beeing thus rather fraught with coller, then furniſhed with good matter: hee betooke himſelfe to his penne, where wee will leaue him for a while, and ſpeake of other matters.

                  DOreſtus, that was now at leaſure to caſt about to bring his purpoſe to a deſired ſucceſſe, and wading betweene ſmall hopes, and huge diſpaires, yet remembring that nothing could be atchiued that was neuer attempted, hee determined to giue the on ſet: and finding Moderna in a place conuenient, neſling himſelfe ſo néere her as he might: to whome ſpeaking in looks,
 for as yet his tongue was not come to a through boldnes, and yet by the many ſeruices he proffered her, ſhe might well perceiue, that although he wanted power, yet hee wanted no will to pleaſe her: thus determining to preſent his ſute, when hee came to the point, feare of offence, and dread of deniall, diſappointed his purpoſe, that hee remained mute: but at the laſt, perceiuing delay bred daunger, houering betweene hope and feare, finding his miſtres at ſo good conuenience, hee began in this maner to diſplay to Moderna, the ſtore-houſe of his deadlie deſires. My extreame affection (moſt worthy Princeſſe
Moderna) will either breake out in words, or breake my hart with ſilence: but it hath at the laſt inforced mee to appeale vnto your curteſie, as the onely medicine that may cure my intollerable ſicknes: nay, incurable I may well call it: for vnleſſe the fruitfull ſhewes of your mercy, do mittigate the fire of my fancie: the drops of your princely fauor, quench ye flame of my affection: and the guerdon of your good will, giue a ſoueraigne plaiſter for my ſecret ſore, I am like to continue in endles miſerie. Sith then my care proceedeth from your beauty, let my ſore bee cured by your bountie: ſith the perfection of your perſon hath wrought my bale, let the effect of your curteſie procure my bliſſe, and reiect him not with rigour, that reſpecteth you with reuerence: loath him not with hate, that loueth you in heart: it is your beauty that hath depriued me of liberty, and it is your bountie that muſt redeeme me from captiuitie: and if my raſhnes bee a fault in preſuming thus to trouble you, let your beautie beare the blame, which is the ſpurre to mine enterprize.
Moderna, that had vowed her ſelfe to another ſaint, & hearing a freſh aſſault giuen to her heart which was already conquered: thought it not good for his ſtomacke, to giue him a ſurfeit of too much fauour, anſwered thus. Sir, as I can perceiue, your ſicknes threatneth no danger of death, and if it bee but a loue matter, the fit wil ſoone be paſt: but alaſſe, your conueiance was nothing cleanly: if you had not the out-ſide of loue to couer your in-ſide of luſt: but bee it loue, or bee it luſt, Doreſtus take this for an anſwere, I haue vowed virginity, I mean to liue chaſt, ceaſe then to craue that cannot be gotten, ſeek not for vnpoſſibilities, you ſay my beauty was the ſpurre to your
 enterpriſe, let my words then make you deſire to leaue of your ſute. I will not féed you with delaies, nor entertaine you with faire wordes, and foule deedes, but ſpeake as I thinke, and ſo you ſhall finde it, and what ſoeuer you ſhall reply, my defence ſhall be to beleeue nothing: but yet leaſt you ſhould thinke mée too much vnthankefull, though I cannot inwardly mittigate your miſerye, I will yet teach you an outwarde plaiſter, the which being applied, you ſhall find a great vertue, to aſſwage the heat of that loue, which you ſay is ſo peſterous and troubleſome vnto you, and thus followeth the medicine. Take two ounces of the ſound of a bell when it is roong for a mans ſoule that died for loue, as much of the neighing of a horſe, that hath brought his Maiſter from Dunmo with a Flitche of Bacon, then take the parings of any mans nailes that is ful foure and twentie yeares olde, and neuer flattered woman: grinde theſe to fine pouder in a winde-mill that ſtands in the bottome of a Fiſh-poole, then take halfe a pinte of the water that is wiped from a mans eies at the buriall of his wife, put to a handfull of a Louers proteſtations made to his Lady without diſſimulation: boyle all theſe together vpon a few coales, then ſtraine it through the lining of any mans gowne that hath beene married full out a yeare, and neuer quarrelled with his wife, put to but one dram of good conſcience, drawne from him that maried his wife more for loue of her vertue, then for the lucre of her dowrie: vſe this plaiſter wiſe, laid warme to your left héel at night when you go to bed, and my life for yours, it ſhal both bring you into quiet ſleepe, and rid you of this incumbraunce that doth ſo trouble your head with loue. Doreſtus, to whom euery ſillable ſhee pronounced was a thunder-bolt, againe anſwered. Alaſſe, let not certaine immaginatiue rules, whoſe truth ſtandeth but on opinion, keep back your pitie and mercy. O Moderna, for thin own vertues ſake, let not my miſeries be quited with diſdaine: I plainely lay my death before you: yea, the death of him that loues you, the death of him whoſe life you may ſaue: O tread not of a ſoule that ſubmits it ſelfe at your feete: let not your noble heart put a doubt, till occaſion be offered: miſtruſt not him whome you ſhall neuer find haulting: If there hath bene a trothleſſe Iaſon, yet there was found a truſty

                  Troylus: and as there hath bene a diſſembling Damocles, was there not yet a loyall Lelius: ſith then my ſafelye onelye conſiſtes in your mercye, I humbly beſeche you to take pitie vpon him, who is either to be made happy or hapleſſe, as it ſhall pleaſe you to awarde. Moderna, not longer able to tarrye the hearinge of more wordes, aroſe from her ſeate and gaue him this for a farewell: Doreſtus, to make you happye withe myne owne miſhappe, I neither canne nor will, to loue him whome I cannot like, were but to wreſt againſt my ſelfe, to flatter him whome I meane not to fancy, is but a tricke of extreame folly: no Doreſtus, it is not poſſible to perſwade me to enter league with fancy, that am a foe to affection, or to followe Venus, that am vowed to Diana, I meane not to loue, leaſt I liue by the loſſe, and ſhe that is frée and will be fettered is a foole, thus Doreſtus you know my minde and ſo farewell: and away ſhe goes leauing Doreſtus, at his meditations: who ſeeing the manner of Moderna, was driuen to vſe patience perforce, thinking her ſharpe aunſwere very hard to be diſgeſted: but after he had a while pauſed on the matter, he burſt out into theſe ſpeeches: But by the ſweet, (Doreſtus) how ſhouldeſt thou know the ſower: but by the blacke, how ſhouldeſt thou know the white, hee neuer acompteth of proſperitie, which hath not béene before pinched with aduerſitie, which perchance Moderna, meanes to make me trie by experience: thinking to féede me with bitter broathes, minding heere-after to giue me a Cullice of better comforte: firſt to daunte me with the ranging ſtormes of deniall, that the calme of her conſent may the more contente me: to make me taſte the bitter pilles of annoy, here-after to diet me with confections of ſwéeter ioy: for the chilling colde of winter, makes the ſpringe time ſéeme more pleaſante: ſoe the frowning lookes of Moderna, will make her ſmiling countenance ſéeme more chéerefull: then ceaſe not Doreſtus to perſue thy ſute with endleſſe paine, either to inioy her curtiſie, or taſt of her crewelty, to thy great happines, or extreame heauines: Doreſtus being ſetled in his determination, thought it conuenient for his better ſpéede, to breake the matter to the king her father, and to craue his conſent and furtherance in the cauſe: hoping that if he
 could win him, he ſhould find Moderna the more tractable, and thinking it not for the beſt to make long delay, he determined in the morning to put in practiſe his pretence, and going to bed thinking to take his reſt for that night, he was no ſoner laide downe, but the picture of his beloued preſented it ſelfe, to his imagination, then calling againe to his remembraunce, her crabbed aunſweres, and her flat deniall to loue: the hight of all ougly ſorrowes, did ſoe horribly appeare before his amaſed minde, that he could take no reſt: then began hee in this manner to complaine, O loue, doeſt thou not thinke the day torment ſufficient, but thou doſt enuy me in the nightes quiet: wilte thou giue my ſorrowes no truce: and Moderna, is thy beautie vtterly voide of pitie, doeſt thou diſdaine to helpe his ague, whoſe Cotidian fit, is conuerted to a frenzy, alas, loue wanting deſire maketh the minde deſperat, and fixed fancy bereaued of loue, turneth into furye, the loyoll loue I beare to
Moderna, and the loathſome feare of her ingratitude, the depe deſire which inforceth my hope, and the deadly diſpaire which infringeth my happe, ſoe trauelleth my minde with contrarie cogitations, that death were thrice more welcome then thus to linger in diſpairing hope: ceaſſing further ſpeches, he lay al the reſt of the might tumbling, and toſſing without any manner of ſléepe: in the morning very early, making him ſelfe ready, and finding the king walking in a pleaſant garden (which vſually he was wonted to do) he vnfoulded to the king, the loue that he bare to his daughter Moderna, humbly beſeching his furtherance in his ſute, proffering ſo larg conditions, as pleaſed the king ſo well, that he not onely promiſed his owne good-will, but alſo aſſured him to win Moderna to conſent.

                  Doreſtus triumpheth before the victorie, the King perſwadeth his daughter to take Doreſtus for hir husband, ſhe cunningly diſſembleth with the King her father.
               
               
                  DOreſtus receiuing theſe ioyfull newes began in this manner to triumphe: what greater proſperitie (quoth he) can
 happen vnto any earthly wight, then if he be croſſed with care to finde a medicine to cure his calamitie, then if he be pinched with paine, to get a plaſter for his paſſion: if hee be drenched in diſtreſſe, to finde a meanes to mittigate his miſerie: which I ſée by proofe performed in my ſelfe, theſe comfortable ſpeeches, hauing now ſalued my forepaſſed ſorrowes, thoſe honye ſweete wordes haue now ſo healed my wounds; that where before I was plagued in perplexitie, I am now placed in felicity; wherbefore I was opreſſed with car, I am now refreſhed with comforte, O friendly fortune, if from henceforth thou furiouſly frown vpon me, if thou daunt me with diſaſter miſhap: this thy friendly curteſie ſhal be ſufficient to counteruaill al future enormity In this maner Doreſtus reioyced to himſelfe, I wil not ſay triumphed before the victorie, the ſequel will manifeſt yt to him that he is deſirous to vnderſtand. The king that was eſpecially well pleaſed to make Doreſtus his ſonne in law, and willing to let ſlip no time, the very ſame day after dinner, ſent for his daughter Moderna into his owne chamber, to whome he vſed theſe wordes. Moderna, as I haue beene carefull to bring thee vp a virgine, ſo I am deſirous to make thée a wife: for as I know, there is nothing more commendable then virginitie, ſo I am not ignorant, that there is nothing more honorable then matrimonie: for if virginitie be pleaſing to one mariage is profitable to many: and as I haue vſed theſe ſpeeches to perſwade thee to marriage, ſo I would haue him that ſhould match with thee, to be ſuch a one, in whoſe ſocietie thou ſhouldeſt not count mariage a bondage, but a fréedome: not a knot of reſtraint, but a bond of liberty: one whome thou ſhouldeſt like for his beauty, and loue for his vertue. To come then from the generall to a perticuler, it is Doreſtus which I wiſh to be thy huſband, and thou to be his wife: nay, Doreſtus is the man that I am determined ſhall be thy huſband, a Prince worthy to bee beloued, and the gemme which is gallant in colour, and perfect in vertue, is the more pretious, the hearbe which hath a faire barke, and a ſweet ſap, is the rather to be eſtéemed: Thus thou knoweſt my minde Moderna, and the onely care that I nowe haue, is to ſée thée married before I die, and thou waxe old: Moderna was driuen into ſuch a maze with this ſodaine motion

                   of her father, as ſhe knew not what aunſwere to ſhape, for ſhee ment nothing leſſe thē to yéeld to his requeſt, hauing vowed in her conceit as before you haue heard. And to make deniall, ſhee thought would either incurre diſpleaſure, or mooue ſuperſtition: but her father liſtening what ſhe would ſay, ſhe thought in this manner to haue ſtopt his mouth, and thus ſhe anſwered. Moſt ſoueraigne Prince, and gratious father, as I know there is no greater bond then dutie, nor no ſtraiter law then nature: for diſobedience in youth, is often galled with diſpight in age: the commaundement of the father, ought to bee a conſtraint to the child: for parents wils are lawes, ſo they paſſe not al lawes, but this dooth eſpecially make me to muſe, that in my tender yeares, my infancy beeing not able to receiue your father lie counſaile, your grace then preferred virginitie as the onely ornament wherewith to adorne me, and now in my riper yeares would you diſſwade me from that, whereunto your ſelfe hath already ſetled my mind: pardon me ſir, I beſeech you, and giue me leaue to continue this ſtate which I now holde as the onely thing that I account deere and precious vnto mee: for although
(as you ſay) marriage bee honourable, yet it is a thing that commeth by courſe, whereas virginitie is no leſſe admirable, and is a precious iewell giuen vs by grace: To loue, is the onely thing that I doe hate▪ and I hope, the fatherly care you tooke in my youth to bring me vp in vertue, ſhall bee ſtill continued, finding mee addicted to the ſame. Moderna anſwered the king, what-ſoeuer perſwaſion I vſed in thine infancye, I know they were ſuch, as fitting for thy yeares: but thou art yet yong, and I am olde: and age hath taught me, that which thy youth cannot conceiue: thy youth warneth me to preuent the worſt, and mine age to prouide the beſt: actions meaſured betime, are ſeldome bitten with repentance: I confeſſe virginitie to be good, but marriage is neceſſary: yéelde then to thy fathers perſwaſions which maye preuent thy perrils. I haue choſen thee a huſband, faire by nature, royall by birth, famous by vertue, learned by education, Doreſtus by name: he I ſay, the Prince of Epirus, it is hee, and no other that I haue determined ſhall bee thy huſband, ſettle thy ſelfe therefore to like of thy fathers choyce, who knoweth beſt what is fit for thee: thus
 leauing his daughter for the time, who departing into her own chamber, where this newe occurant gaue her freſhe occaſion, thus to reuiue her former lamentations. O vertue, either I haue hither too had but a ſhadowe of thee, or thou thy ſelfe art but a ſhadow: but ſeeke Moderna, ſeeke to aſſwage this flame and to quench this fire, which as it commeth without cauſe, ſo it wil conſume without reaſon, if thou wilt thus giue the rains of thy libertie to thy franticke affections, medicine will come to late when the diſeaſe will grow incurable: but can I deny, what the deſtinies haue decreed, is it in my power to peruert that which the Planets haue placed, or to reſiſt that which the ſtarres haue ordained: what need I vſe ſo many words, I am not the firſt, neither ſhall I bee the laſt, that haue beene thus wroong with this fit of frenzie: thy father would be contented thou couldeſt loue, and thou therefore diſcontented becauſe thou dooſt loue: I, but thy father would haue thee ſo to loue Doreſtus the Prince of Epirus: I, but thou art in loue with Bruſanus, the Prince of Hungaria: Why, then thou loueſt a Prince as noble, as vertuous, as famous, as learned, as beautifull, and euery way as worthie as Doreſtus is: Loue him ſtill then Moderna, loue him ſtill, what, wilt thou preferre thy fathers will before thine owne liking, or thy fathers liking before thine owne loue? No, no, doe not ſo: chooſe for thy ſelfe, whatſoeuer be thy chaunce, folow thine owne content, care not for the reſt, thou canſt but repent: but foole that thou art, where bee thy wits? art thou ſure all this while, that Bruſanus will like of thée? Thou loueſt him, but howe doeſt thou thinke hee will requite it, thou ſtoopeſt without a ſtalle, thou commeſt without call, yea, and to an emptie fiſt: O lawleſſe loue, O witles will, O fancy full fraught with frenzie. But why doſt thou moue doubtes Moderna? miſdéeming either Bruſanus or thy ſelfe: ſhall the reward of loue be loathing? doth good wil deſerue hatred? or fancie defiaunce: or what is there in thee that Bruſanus ſhould miſlike. Art thou not a Princeſſe, as he is a Prince? I, but his perfection hath made thee vnperfect. But, art not thou the next heire to the kingdome of Dalmatia, it is that Moderna, it is that: thou haſt nowe hit it, that makes Doreſtus ſo much to loue, and wil bring Bruſanus to ſtoope to thy lure, fear
 not then Moderna, for ſhee is acceptable to euerye man that brings a Crowne for her dowrie. Moderna ſetling her ſelfe in this reſolution, ſo much the more armed her determinations as ſhe ſaw her ſelfe aſſailed by her fathers conſtraint: yet ſtill remembring ſhee muſt wade betweene conſtancy and curteſie: ſhe therefore of pollicie vſed ſome better countenance to Doreſtus, ſometime baiting his hope with a diſh of little certaintie: neither comforting him with too much kindnes, nor vtterlie diſmaying him with too rough repulſes: and nowe her onelie care conſiſted, howe ſhee might with modeſty make her loue knowen to Bruſanus, the which with all ſpeed ſhe intended to put in practiſe. In this meane while, Bruſanus, who had bene long at his ſtudie, was prepared with an anſwere to ſend vnto
Doreſtus: the tenour whereof inſueth in this manner.

               I Perceiue (Doreſtus) that between vs the olde ſaying is like to bee verified, which is, that one fable draweth on another. And heere I cannot a little woonder to thinke, what humour ſhould draw Doreſtus to praiſe thoſe for the onely paragons of the world, that in truth are the very out-caſtes of nature, who ſith their firſt creation to this preſent, there was neuer anie man (of vpright iudgement) that durſt be ſo fooliſh-hardy, as once to beſtow of them a generall commendacion: thoſe onelie excepted, whoſe fooliſh affections drowned in the ſeas of folly, are thereby made partiall, in the behalfe of their miſtres: but where blind men muſt iudge of colours, there is ill painting, & where louers dare ſpeake in the behalfe of wemen, there reaſon is enforſt to play banckrout. But if Doreſtus, to try what he could do in a bad matter, would therfore write in the praiſe of women, as Eraſmus wrote a booke in the praiſe of folly: héer is now the olde prouerbe neglected. It were better to bee idle, then ill occupied: and although I meane but ſleightlie to run ouer your ſorie allegations, yet I hope you will not turne
 my modeſtie vnto wante of matter, but in ſéeking confirmation from the Philoſophers for the commendations of wemen, would ſéeke the teſtimonie of the Iurye that had al ready pronounced him guiltye: or like a madde man that would power on a paile of water when he ment to make the fire burne: But ſhal I make repetition of their ſeueral opinions, and what they haue written touching wemen in generall.
Marcus Aurelius, that noble Emperour, and worthy orator hath theſe ſentences: There is not ſo fierce and perilous an enemy to man, as his owne wife: Wemen be of a tender condition, they will complaine of a ſmall griefe, and for leſſe cauſe will riſe into greate pride, hardye is that woman that dare giue councell to a man, but he is a foole that will aſke it, but he moſt fooliſhe that will follow it: It is naturall for a woman, to diſpiſe thoſe thinges that are proffered vnasked, ſoe it is death to be denied of that ſhe demaundeth: There is no creature that more deſireth honor and worſe kéepeth it, then doth a woman: wemen for a little good, looke for great hire, but for much euill, no chaſticement. Thus far Marcus Aurelius, and this might ſuffice, if men were not wilfull, but I knowe that neither the dignitie of his perſon, being an Emperour, nor the reputation of his wiſdome, being a Philoſopher were ſufficient to guarde him, but they would ſo taunt and raile at him, as he were not worthy to weare his miſtres collours, that could not finde out ſome name of reproche in diſgrace of the Emperour: I will therefore accompanie him, with ſuch accomplices, as ſhall bee able to ſtand by him in all aſſaultes, and we will firſt begin with Senica, who hath theſe wordes: Inconſtancye is a common infirmitie both to children and wemen, the one through ſlendernes of wit, the other as a natural ſicknes: Giue thy wife no power ouer thée, for to day if thou ſuffer her to treat vpon thy foote, to morrowe ſhe will ſure tread vpon thy heade: Diogenes: they that had rather bee conuerſante with wemen then with men, are like ſwine that had rather be rooting in durt and mire, then in faire and cleane water: Beware of the baites of wemen, which are laide out to catche men, for they are greate hinderaunces, to him that deſires wiſdome:
Plutarche ſwéet ſauours and oiles are more fit for wemen then
 for men, becauſe they ſmell of folly: Hermes, beautye in wemens faces, and folly in their liues, be two euils, that fretteth life, and reſteth goods: Protegines, in thrée pointes wemen and fools be of like condition, for they are ful fo vain affections, curious and peuiſh to pleaſe, & very wilful in fooliſhnes: Plato: a woman is a neceſſarie euill, wemens company, a michſéefe that cannot be ſhunned: Socrates: wemen are more pitifull then men, more enuious then a ſerpent, more malicious then a tirante, more deceitfull then the diuell: Ariſtotle: wemen in miſcheefe are wiſer then men: Chylon: hee that haunteth much wemens company, cannot be ſtrong, nor he rich that delighteth in wine: Pithagoras: there are in wemens eies two kindes of teares the one of griefe, the other of deceite: Tertullian: a notable Doctor and piller of the churche with whome we will conclude, ſaith thus: woman was the firſt forſaken of Gods lawe, the diſcloſer of the forbiden trée, and the gate of the diuell: Tell me now Doreſtus, howe can you commend trechery for truth, vanitie for veritie, and ougly vice for ſeemelie vertue, or will you yet condemne mee for an euill ſpeaker: But becauſe womā was giuen to be a helper vnto man, muſt it therefore followe that the helper is more worthy then the thing holpen: then muſt it néedes fall out that the grome that helpes Doreſtus of with his hoſe when he goes to bed at night, is of better rekoning then Doreſtus himſelfe, & the ſlaue that but carries lime and ſtone to the building, is to be preferred before the maiſter workman: but I will graunte Doreſtus, that wemen he helpers, for he that followes them a pace, they lightly helpe him to the diuell: Your compariſon for the fining of mettals, I cannot miſlike, for that it hath ſome affinitie with the truth: for in déede, the more mettales be fined the purer they proue, and gold before it be brought to his perfection, is firſt clenſed from his earthlye ſubſtance, and being once drawne from his ore and droſ

                   when man was firſt framed from out the ſlime and duſt of the earth, he was not yet perfecte gold, for why there remained braſſe and copper, that is humoure and paſſion, wherefore it was conuenient there ſhould be a ſecond clenſing, which being once performed, man was then in full perfection, and of the groſſer ſubſtance there was framd a baſer creature women being drawne from the partes where our affections lye hiden, and as ſhe was thus indued with infinit paſſion, ſo it was neceſſarie to take from her all force, for had ſhe had abillitie to haue performed her cruelty and rage, all the deuels in hell had not béene able to haue ruled her, and therfore (according to the olde prouerbe) God ſendes a curſte cow ſhorte hornes: But was it ſuch a benifit for man to be cupled to a woman, rather then to a Lion, to a Tiger or a Serpent, no truely, woman is more furious then a lion, more cruell then a tiger, more venimus then a ſerpent, and more ſubtill then the diuell: and by her figured charmes brought man from that bleſſedneſſe in the which hee was firſt created, when the diuell himſelfe was not able to do it: But to what ſorte of men is it that wemen be ſo acceptable, forſoth to louers, let vs directly then ſeeke out whereto loue leades vs: The loue of men to wemen being a rage exceding all other paſſions, makes vs forſake the loue of God and to imagin our good to reſt in them, as if we ſhould do worſhip to Idoles, whoſe nature is vnder vain reſemblances, to corrupt the deuotion of men, a thing ſo common in example, that (to a ſencible iudgment) a ſlender rehearſall may ſuffice) and who ſo euer treadeth that deſperat laborinth of loue, is in ordinarie deſtiny, of a wiſe man to take the habit of a foole, of a carefull man to become negligent: of a valiant man to become ſo weake as to ſtand in awe of a fooliſh womans word, of a prouident man to looſe all pollicy: of a younge man to become withered, of a free man to become miſerably bound, of a milde man to beare the burthen of an aſſe: of a religious man to become an Idolater: of a riche man honoured, a poore man ſcorned: of a patient man to be a reuenger of the filthy cauſes of his miniō: to be briefe both to forget god & looſe ye knowledge of himſelf: I neuer knew any one truly tranſlated into the ſtat of a perfect louer, but after he had poſſeſſed his actual felicity in
 loue did not atend inward perplexities with outward diſquietnes, confuſed counſels, careles executiō, broken ſpéech, vnſound iudgements, yea, ſuch a generall negligence in all his actions and conuerſation of life, that in a due conſideration of the affects of loue, in his example it might eaſily bee diſcerned, there is more galle then honie, leſſe pleaſure then paine, more care then comfort, and more want of courage, then due commendation of a noble mind. I haue heard of many that were madde for loue▪ yet I neuer hearde of any that were wiſe in loue, I haue knowen the wiſe haue bene beſotted by fancie, yet I neuer knew fancie that made a wiſe man: for it is no more poſſible, that loue ſhould be without paſſion, then the Sunne without light, fire without heat, or water without moiſture, whoſe pleaſant motions are mixt with wonderfull diſquiet, his little pleaſure with piles of ſorrow, his ſmall brookes of tranſitorie ioy, with great riuers of extreame anguiſh: In loue, what ſéeeth the eie? laſciuiouſnes: what heareth the eare? laſciuiouſnes: what inureth the body? laſciuiouſnes: the badge of loue idlenes, the beſt reſt corrupt delights▪ the finall ende repentaunce. Loue is a bitter ſweet, a poyſoned bait, a golden hooke, a contumelious comfort, a diueliſh intent. In loue wee miſſpend our time, conſume our goods, waſt our lands, yea, wee doe corrupt both body and ſoule. By loue, our hearts are blinded, our vnderſtanding dulled, our memories mangled, our bodies diſtempered, and all deſire of wiſedome is ſet at a bay. Thus the pore louer findes his pleaſure tranſlated into a quality of bitternes, and his hope ſo turned into diſpaire, that hee hath no other refuge then in death, and yet in him he hardly finds medicine. If he be but a little diſgraced of his bodie, he becommeth wilde of countenance, vnquiet in minde: yea, his whole ſtate ſo reſtleſſe, as if hee were tormented with ſome hurtfull ſpirite, and in the abſence of his miſtreſſe, you ſhall neuer ſee him ſettled in anie company, or pla

                   of what value or worthines ſoeuer it be, but as vacabonds without a warraunt, or people fearing the fall of the firmament, they run heere and there, as though their ſafetie conſiſted onely in the eie of their miſtreſſe: Peraduenture, there be ſom that wil miſtake my meaning, thinking this loue that I would ſéem to diſgrace, is but diſhoneſt liking, or rather
 as it may be tearmed lawleſſe luſt, ſuch as is practiſed with euery mercenarie woman: but take loue when it is lawfullie ment, wherin it is beſt to be admitted, and vſe wemen in their pureſt kinde, whereunto they were firſt created, and you ſhall finde, that there is not ſo much care in the one, but there is as great combre in the other: and that the one bredeth not ſo much wracke, but the other bringeth as much woe: and where they both doe but promiſe vs a dramme of delight they will ſurelie pay vs with a pound of deſpight. For the inſtitution of marriage, I confeſſe it to be good: nay further, I acknowledge it to be honourable, and it was firſt ordained to a moſt godly purpoſe, which was to kéepe men from that filthy ſinne of fornication: but what men, ſuche as were not able to containe their fleſhly deſires within the limites and bounds of chaſtity, for as it is ſaid, chaſtity is the beauty of mans ſouls, and it is further affirmed, that the firſt degree of chaſtity is pure virginity, the ſecond honeſt matrimony, ſo that marriage hath heere but a ſecond place: now by this wee may conclude, that marriage was ordained but as a meane or medicine, wherewith to allay our fleſhly luſts: and like as in all other our naturall infirmities, when they oppreſſe vs, we by and by ſeeke the Phiſition, who to purge the humour, miniſtreth vnto vs but an Apothecaries drugge, the which by artificiall meanes may well bee made pleaſant in the receipt, but in operation and woorking, it ſo diſtempereth euery part of our body, as we ſhall neuer finde reſt nor quiet, ſo long as there is any parcell of it remaining within vs: ſo hee that is infected with the ſicknes of loathſome luſt, he may wel ſeeke Phiſicke, that is, he may take a wife to allay the rage of his fleſhly deſires, but he ſhall find her but an Apothecaries drugge: for though ſhe ſeeme pleaſant in the firſt receit, yet in the winding vp, ſhe prooueth a continuall torment, and his haſtye attempt is euer rewarded with a gnawing repentance. Marriage is tearmed by the name of a yoake, by other-ſome it is called a bondage: and mee thinkes that theſe very names might perſwade vs, that there is no great felicity to be ſought for in his fruite. I can moſt fitly compare louers to hunters, that likes better of the ſporte, then they doe of the game it ſelfe when they haue it: or like him that would needs
 goe a fiſhing, though hee caught but a frogge: and my louer in the time of his wooing, thinkes there is no greater bliſſe, but hauing once attained the height of his deſire, his affections ſtraight begins to decline. Thus you may perceiue, that in mariages there is not ſuch ſwéet, but it is ſauced with too much ſowre, in loue ſuch gouernment, which ſauoureth not of follie, nor in affection ſuche fore-ſight, which is not repented with great heart-breake. O fooliſh therefore, that will ſuffer themſelues to bee conquered by a woman, whome God at the firſt created but as an inſtrument to mans neceſſity: But it is their beauty that be witcheth vs, for with a pearce of their ein, there is harboured ſuch power, that with the nature of the Baſilike, they ſo inuenome euerye part of vs, that no art will ſerue to purge it. Truely, the folly of affection is woonderfull, yet are the errours of beauty more admirable, when of herſelfe ſhee is but a painted ſepulchre, and in her actions, the diminiſher of all naturall and morall reaſon: we praiſe beautie, what more vading, we honour beautie, what more corrupt: wee ſorrowe for beauty, what more fooliſhe. In greene graſſe you ſhall finde biting ſerpents, in glorious ſepulchers, rotten bones, in paineted pots, deadly poyſon: in faire wemen, falſe hearts. Their immodeſt boldnes many times makes them aduenture of that which is both expreſly forbidden them, and alſo is moſt loathſome and contrary vnto nature, as Myrrha, to fall in loue with her father. Phedra, with her ſonne. Biblis, with her brother.
Paſiphe, with a Bul. The matrons of Rome in the time of Papirus, pretēding to haue two huſbands, did manifeſtly bewray their mordinate luſt, and is it not as likely that thoſe dames, incroching further liberty, might haue ſought for a third, and ſo for as many as they had liſt: but Doreſtus, if wemen were ſo vertuous as you would make them, their vanity would be leſſe in attire, and themſelues not ſo popin-iae-like in their conuerſation: their golden Calles would bee ſet a ſide, which are more curious then comely, mor precious then neceſſary, vnleſſe with the olde ſuperſtition, wee ſhould decke an artificiall Idoll, to draw the world to a vaine worſhipping: their curling of haire ſo deuided and laid into lockes, that it ſeemeth to cary precepts and propoſitions of Art, their maſkes and vailes for their faces,
 that leads men in imagination of greater beautie then indeede there is: yea, to what other purpoſe are their Courtiſans fannes, their huge Verdingals, with infinite other vanities, but onely to pleaſe men, and in pleaſing of them, to be deſired of them: but would you know the very miſteries of theſe alluring curioſities: they ſerue (indeede) for inſtrumentes to plead for that by ſhew, which they would bee glad to ſpeake for with thier tongue, but for ſooth they muſt doe all thinges with modeſtie. They would be ſeene to haue many ſeruants to ſue vnto them, for that in their owne fancy, is the cheefeſt teſtimonie of their beautye, and they haue cunning to imbrace euerye one with a perticuler affection, and that with ſuch ſlight as the wiſeſt ſhall be lead in hope of their good wils. They haue with the Iugler chaunge of entertainement for euery company, to perſwade one with ſpeach, to court an other with lookes, to be familiar with a third by ſigns, to allure a fourth by falſe trains of cloaked honeſty, feeding them all with vncertaine hope, and him ſhee makes the Aſſe to beare the burthen, that beares her moſt affection. One ſhall be her ſeruant, and he muſt weare her colour, a ſecond her partner, and weare her garter, a third her Louer, and poſſeſſe vnchaſt bed-pleaſures, and though the two firſt, bee as lauaſhe of their expences as the reſt: yet they muſt be content to holde the candle, while the third is offering to our Lady. They loue aboue all things to bee ſolicited with great importunity, accounting him for a meacocke, that wil be repulſed with a firſt deniall, affirming that a woman muſt ſay nay and take it: and yet the more ſhe ſeeth you plagued in paſſion for her, the leſſe careful is ſhe of your countenaunce, but the more you grow cold in your loue, the greater increaſeth ye heat of her affections, like a diſeaſe, whoſe cure comes by contrarie medicin: ſuch is ye violence of their ſpite, that with ye 
                  Salimander they ſeem to haue a felicity, in the torment of the pore fools that ſerues them, whoſe preſence they feede with a flattering hope, and in his abſence they make a ſcoffe at his honeſt affections: Thus you may perceiue they haue tongues to traine, eies to allure, teares to excuſe, lookes to atract, ſmiles to flatter, imbracementes to prouoke, frownes to delay, beckes to recall, lippes to inchaunt, kiſſes to inflame, bodies to perfume, and al
 theſe to poyſon: By their ſlightes they haue made Emperours idell as Anthony, ſtrong men féeble as Sampſon, valient men effeminate as Hercules, wiſemen diſſolute as Salomon, eloquent men laſciuious as Aurelius: Wilt thou yet bee maried, when thou muſt beare with all her inormities, her railing, her ſcoulding, her curſſing, her banning, her enuy, her pride, her flattering, her frowning, her crueltie, her ſpite, her wilines, her wantoneſſe, her nicity, her ſlight, her ſubtilty, her queſines, her diſquietnes, her taunts, her ſcoffes, her floutes, her periury: but thou wilt ſay for increaſe females are good, very true, but for decreaſe there are none ſoe ill, for who ſoe euer taſteth of their breathing will waxe bedlem, but hee that delighteth in their brauling, will ſurely proue a begger: Their commoditie as it is got with care, ſoe it is kept with to much diſquiet: haſt thou a wife and is ſhe wiſe, then will ſhe ſure make thee a foole, if ſhe be foliſh, ſhe wil make thee aſhamed; if ſhe be faire, toles on gueſt to thy houſe more then thou haſt néede off: if ſhe be foule, ſhe wil afflight thee: if barren, thy wo is increaſed: if fruitfull, ſhe heapeth vpon thee either care to prouide for a towarde ſonne, or ſorrowe to preuente the practiſes of a wicked daughter: Thus may you ſe their companye doth corrupt vs, their vices without number, their vertues none at al, their wit is will, their truth trechery, their truſt treaſon, their faith fraud, their curtiſie cruelty, their ſimpryng ciuilitie, is bodie of al humanitie: You may ſe Doreſtus, the ſubiect I haue taken in hand miniſtreth ſuch matter as I knowe not how to make an end, yet heere I will conclude, hoping that hereafter you will bee better aduiſed, howe you commend chalke for cheeſe, copper for gold, or ſhrowes for ſaintes: Acknowledge your folly, be ſorry for your errour, it is the greateſt ſigne of grace, for a man to confeſſe his fault: Bruſanus hauing thus ended his lines, ſent them immediately to Doreſtus, who taking a ſurvay of the crciomſtances, fel downe of his knées, and holding vppe his hands to Venus, craued mercye, thinking he committed more then ſacriledge in reading ſo horrible blaſphemy to the diety of her ſonne: Inioyning himſelfe for pennaunce to make a preſent aunſwere, which immediately he ſet himſelfe vntoo.

               IN this meane while, Moderna, tranſported with deſire to whome ſhe had already bequeathed her ſelfe, wherefore after that ſhe had with earneſt and long indeuour ſought to reſiſt vndeſiſtable loue, at the lengthe taking courage, bouldlye to perſiſt, ſhe entreth with her ſelfe into theſe arguments: What reaſon haſt thou Moderna to contende with loue, that is both reſtleſſe and vnreaſonable, or what ſtandſt thou vpon theſe ouer curious pointes, thy fathers diſpleaſure or thine owne modeſtie, when the firſt may be pacified, and the ſeconde nothing preiudiced: yea Moderna, thou maiſt reuerence as a daughter, and loue as a wife, and yet the latter not preiudicial to the firſt: But how ſhould I do now to make my loue knowen to Bruſanus, what ſhall I tell him, I loue him, and my ſelfe become a ſuter, for that euery meane woman is ordinarily required in, fie no, that were a bould part, why then thou ſhouldeſt be noted of lewdneſſe, and generally condemned of to much lightneſſe: and who ſhal condemne thee for thine honeſt likeing, thou doſt not meane to practiſe lawleſſe luſt, and lawfull loue is neither offenciue before God nor men, feare not then Moderna, make thy loue knowen to Bruſanus, the hand of mariage once confirmed, is inoughe to couer all faultes: Speake then if thou mindeſt to ſpéede, ſue to him for loue, that perhappes woulde ſpeake to thée, but that hee feares a repulſe: Fortune (as it ſhould ſéeme) verye fauourable to further her intente, for the verye ſame euining as ſhe was walking into a pleaſant garden to take the ayre: ſhee founde Bruſanus ſitting ſolitarie by himſelfe, debating in his minde what ſucceſſe were like to follow his friend Doreſtus in his loue: to whome comming with a pleaſant countenance, and yet no other then ſtood with modeſtie: ſhe ſaluted in this manner: It ſéemeth (curteous Prince
Bruſanus) you haue ſome certaine cerimonies to performe, you ſit ſo ſadly, what ſhoulde moue your melancoly demeanure, if
 ought be here that miſlikes you, forbid it, if any thing that may delight you commaund, and it ſhall be had: Truely madame
(aunſwered Bruſanus) you are miſtaken, for neither am I ſoe holy as to meditate ſo much, nor in ſo pleaſant moode, to laugh at euery conceite, for other paſſion, if I ſéeme a ſaint, I hope I ſhall ſcape the diuell: I am the better pleaſed (aunſwered Moderna) if you be well contented, but how like you this country of Illeria: As I ſhould do Lady (aunſwered Bruſanus) it is pleaſant in climat, populous in Citties, plentious in dainties, and well ſtored with manye braue perſonages: But our wemen are nothing ſo faire here as they are in Hungaria (aunſwered
Moderna) nor our ladies ſo wel pleaſing to your fancy, as peraduenture you haue mette withall in other places: It is the thinge I leaſt care for (anſwered Bruſanus) and yet if the perfections of their mindes, be anſwerable to the habitude of their bodies, I feare me there is no other climate that can ouer-looke more beautifull, or afforde more wiſe, then I haue ſeene in Illeria: If your thoughtes be anſwerable to your wordes (aunſwered
Moderna) the end muſt thus follow, that where you alowe ſo preciſly, you muſt loue a little, or elſe in contemninge that you commend, we ſhall condemne you in that you pleade not guilty: That were to much extreamity (aunſwered Bruſanus) for ſoe by the déeming of mine eye, I might be doomed to mine owne diſtruction: Moderna, that had thus preuily felt his repulſe, although not beating ſo amorouſly as ſhe did wiſh: yet hauing oportunitie to vtter what ſhe would, not omitting therefore ſo good occacion, ſhe ſaith: It is no hard matter (Bruſanus) to bring inward liking to outward confeſſion, and if you wil not thinke me to be more prodigal of my preſent, then your fancy will ſerue to take in good parte, knowe this that ſith thy firſt ariuall here at my fathers courte, mine eies haue béene ſo daſeled with the beames ef thy beauty, and my minde ſo ſnared with the view of thy vertues, that thou only thou, art the man whome I like and loue: and to cut off ſpéeches, which might ſéeme to ſauour either of flattery or deceite, as thou art the firſt vnto whome I haue vowed my loue, ſo thou ſhalt be the laſt, onely requiring this for my good will that thou take me to thy wife: for other-wiſe to practiſe pleaſure without vertue, I proteſt
 my minde is nothing leſſe: heere withall the teares ſtreaming downe her eies, gaue her a ſhorte pauſe to this that followeth: againe ſhe ſaith: In troth thou maiſt thinke either my meſſage is great, or my modeſtie little, either that I take ſmal care of my ſelfe, or repoſe great truſt in thée, who ſoe vnfitting for my calling, without any regarde to my eſtate, do ſo prodigally offer my ſelfe, to the diſpoſition of thy iudgment, to conceiue of me at thine owne pleaſure, being prouoked there vnto by the purenes of my loue, and the fidellity of my good wil: honeſty being the only guide of my conceites: if I haue then committed a fault, it is in louing thée to well: Heere againe the teares ſtopped her words for a time, but hauing dried her eies, ſhe thus procéeded: If you finde ought immodeſtly eſcaping my tongue, impute the ſame to the integrety of my loue, and the neceſſitie of ſpéedye diſpatche: my father hauinge already promiſed me in marriage, to your friend & companion
Doreſtus, whom in my hart I could neuer fancy, & whom with all my ſoule I vtterly renounce, and haue wholie ſettled my ſelfe to be thine onely one: wherefore, neither feare nor ſcorne to inioy that which is thine, or at the leaſt-wiſe, let her preſentlie vnderſtand thy pleaſure, whoſe good or bad daies, whollie conſiſts in thy good or bad anſwere: thus ending her ſpéeches, ſhe now againe beginnes to weep. Bruſanus, that was almoſt out of his wits to hear this louing diſcourſe, returned this anſwere for her better comfort. Madame, when dogges falles to ſnarling, ſerpents to hiſſing, and wemen to wéeping: the one meanes to bite, the other to ſting, and the third to deceiue: but doe you looke for an anſwere: truely madame, I haue no leaſure to loue, I muſt about other buſines, and thus away hee flinges, leauing Moderna in a pittifull plight (you may imagine) who finding her ſelfe ſo ſhaken off, departed preſently into her chamber, and caſting her ſelfe vppon her bed, ſhee cloſed her eies, as if each thing ſhe ſaw had bene a picture of her miſhap, where ſhe began thus to exclaime. Alaſſe (quoth ſhe) diſſpiſed
Moderna: is this the reward of thy giuen away liberty? Why didſt thou not holde thy thoughts in their ſimple courſe, and content thy ſelfe with the loue of thine owne vertue? O vnkinde
Bruſanus, could thy force and courage finde out no 
                     •
                  tter
 conqueſt, then to triumph ouer her miſhappes, who at the firſt ſight did wiſh thée all happines? ſhall it bee ſaid, that the mirrour of man-kind hath beene the wracke and ruine of a Ladie that loued him? what triumphe canſt thou make of this conqueſt? what ſpoiles wilt thou carrie away of this my vnderſerued ouerthrow? But O wicked mouth, how dareſt thou blaſpheme the ornament of the earth, the veſſell of vertue, the very obiect that all eies owe reuerence vnto? and how maieſt thou blame him? or wherein hath hee offended thée? O no, no: there is no fault, but in thine owne imaginations, that would thinke that ſo high a perfection would ſtaine it ſelfe with ſo great impoſſibilities. Alaſſe, hee hath then doone thée no wrong, it was thine own weaknes that wrought thine owne woe, thou maieſt then beginne to hate thy ſelfe, but neuer leaue to loue him. But what a labyrinth am I entred into, I diſdain my fortune, and yet I reuerence him that diſdains me, I accuſe his vngratfulnes, and haue his vertue in admiration. Oh heauens, I would his vnkindnes could race out the deapth of my affection, or my affection could make him to relent from his vnkindnes.
Moderna thus taking to her ſelfe the waight of her own woes, left off further ſpeaking, and beganne to turne her ſelfe to euery thing: as if change of obiects might helpe her inuention, and although ſhe had a great while traueiled her thoghts, not ſettling any determination, in the ende ſhee reſolued from that time forward, to reſtraine the libertie of her ſences▪ not ſo much to looke on the Sun, that had dimde her eies with brightnes,
Doreſtus, that had bene all this while buſie at his penne, and being now prepared of an anſwere to Bruſanus, ſent it immediatly vnto him in theſe words.

               VVHen the Foxe doth once begin to preach, good wemen then beware your Géeſe, and where vanitie dare oppoſe it ſelfe for verity, there vice may cry checke, but neuer giue
 the mate. How miſerable is the condicion of thoſe men, that wil make themſelues guilty of their owne mothers diſgrace: and how vnnaturall may that ſéede bee accounted, which will ſhew it ſelfe vnthankfull to the ſoile: and although groſſe queſtions are to be anſwered with ſlender reaſons, and adle heads ſhould be ſcoffed at with idle anſweres: yet to helpe ſimplicity, thus beſet with ſubtilty, I muſt not neglect the defence of ſo many innocent Dames, for any reſpect of a deprauing friend. For your large exhortatorie, I let it paſſe as friuolous: but we muſt not doe wemen that wrong, to condemne them for a little fooliſh Philoſophy: for as the Philoſophers were men, ſo they had many faults: ther were ſome of them Paraſites, ſom Epicures, ſome Ieſters, ſome railers, ſome inſected with pride, ſome with couetouſnes, but moſt laſcinious: and it is a cuſtome of ill men, to defame wemen openlye, when they haue abuſed them ſecretly. Such a one was your great Emperour, and worthy Philoſopher Marcus Aurelius, whome you ſo muche account of: but who more diſſolute in the company of wemen, yet who more prodigall in defaming of wemen: in the diſordered demeanure of his owne wife, Fauſtine did many times ſo diſquiet him, that he was not able to moderate himſelfe, no not withall his precepts of Philoſophie. I doe not ſpeake this to confirme Bruſanus in his opinion, that wemen were thus able to martir the minds of theſe learned Philoſophers, but I ſpeak it aſwell to confute thoſe bitter inuectiues pronounced by the Philoſophers, (peraduenture in a furie) as alſo to confound their actions, that notwithſtanding their pretended knowledg, would ſuffer themſelues to bee ſeduced, not onely by wemen that liue in ſuſpect, but ſome of them moſt notoriouſly known, as namely Layis of Corinth, whome Ariſtippus ſo nicely courted, and to whome Demoſtines came to cheapen, but her ware was too hie prized. Periander, chiefe Philoſopher in Gréece at the inſtaunt of a ſtrumpet, ſlewe his honeſt wife. Anacharſis was ſo bewitched on his Curtiſan Ielaua, that he ſo inſtructed her in his knowledge of Philoſophy, that on a time while he lay ſicke, ſhe ſupplied his place of reading in the ſchoole. Cleobulus, when hee was 60. yeares olde, and had read Philoſophy
45, yeares, climing vp a window, to haue come to his beloued,
 fell downe from the ladder, and died of the bruſe. Solon, that was accounted ſuch a ſage, was beſotted of his owne bond-woman, whome he brought from the warres: Ariſtotle ſo much renowmed for his wit, at the fond requeſt of his fooliſh miſtreſſe, made himſelfe a ſillie Aſſe, creeping about a chamber with a bridle in his mouth: where dame folly his miſtreſſe, ſitting on his backe, (hauing appointed her companions in priuy corners to behold this pageant) made but a ſcorne of that learned Philoſopher. Terrence was hanged out of a window in a Baſket. Socrates was crowned with a piſſe-pot by his own wife Zantippa. By this you may perceiue, that theſe men, notwithſtanding their great philoſophy, ſubmitted themſelues to the wils of wemens of litle modeſty: & is it not like that ſuch as will commit Idolatrye with wicked wemen without care▪ may not after blaſpheme all wemen without cauſe, and that they will obſerue as little grauity in their vnbridled furie, as they obſerued reaſon in their diſordered fantaſie. But to make proofe and triall of mettals, there is no better meane then to bring them to the touch, then ſhall you find men to be furious, froward, ouer-thwart, raſh, ſullen, boyſterous, harſh, ſturdye, and giue them their beſt commendacions, you may compare them but to Iron, which ſheweth by his ruſt, the vneuen temperature of the elements, and malitious influence of the Planets in his compoſition, prefiguring the vngodly eſtate of man, waſted by the flame of concupiſcence, and canker of looſe life: where women by nature are mild, modeſt, ſober, ſilent, gentle, louing, humble, meeke, lowly, and in euery perfection as pliant as the pureſt golde, whoſe propertie is neither yéelding to the moyſtnes of the water, nor conſuming by the extreame furie of the fire, is the tipe of thoſe, who diſpiſing all thinges, are afflicted for vertue: & where the countenaunce of a man threatneth nothing but cruelty, the very lookes of a woman promiſeth mercy and pittie: But I thinke there was neuer Lion ſo furious, neuer Tiger ſo cruell, neuer Viper ſo infectious, neuer Aſpicke ſo mortall, neither euer Woolfe ſo rauenous, but the males will rather oppoſe themſelues to defend their Females, then any way to greeue them: and although theſe brute beaſts are bereaued of reaſon, yet in the conuerſation of their
 kinde, they ſhew themſelues more worthie then man: and was it not Adams owne wretchednes, that wrought his owne fall in Paradice. Let Bruſanus looke better of his text, and he ſhal find it to bee ſo, and that Adam could neuer after haue riſen againe, but by the ſeed of a woman. And now I can but pittie
Bruſanus, who hath taken ſuch pains, framed ſuch arguments, alleadged ſuch examples, gathered ſuch concluſions, and hath induced ſo many reaſons, and all in the diſgrace of loue, vnder the ſhadow whereof he hath figured the very ſubſtance of luſt They are euill acquainted with the nature of honeſt loue, who will diſpoſe him onely vnder a contentment ſo fraile, being in himſelfe ſo deuine and wonderfull. The Philoſophers, who in a deepe in-ſight, thinking to attaine to the vnderſtanding of nature, imagined loue to bee a moſt excellent forme or plot excéeding generallye the conſideration of man: the accidentes which often doe happen through the elements of fire and water, are many times perrillous, and yet to hinder or take away their vſe, were to driue nature from her courſe, euen ſo it is in loue, whoſe profeſſion you wiſhe vs to leaue for certaine light inconueniences accompanieng him by circumſtance, without any conſideration of the ſoueraigne benifites which ſecretly lie ſhrowded and hiden in him: and therefore as loue is a poyſon vnto fooles, ſo it is ſwéete to them that knowe how to vſe him, for to loue without reaſon, is a token of luſt, and to liue without loue an argumente of follye: And therefore Bruſanus you labour with greate wronge to exempt vs from that diuine amitie whiche the almightie him ſelfe hath not onelye commended, but alſo ſtreightly commanded vnto vs: If our Creator hath ſaid it is not good for man to liue alone, how dare we ſay we know better what is méet for vs then he that made vs, if he hath ſaid, thou ſhalt leaue father and mother and cleaue to thy wife, dare we ſay ſhe is but an Apothicaries drugge, and marriage to be eſtéemed as a yooke or a bondage, but a ſwéete yooke to be coupled to vertue, and a happie bondage to be linked to beautie, but what greater honour then that we do owe to our parentes, expreſly commaunded: Honour thy father and mother, and yet this holy inſtitution of wedlocke is more worthely dignified, Thou ſhalt leaue father
 and mother and cleaue to thy wife, when a man therefore betakes himſelfe to wife hee giues no occation to be ſlaundered, but iuſt occation to be honoured.
               But Bruſanus, me thinke you ſkip a little beyond your ſkil thus to quarrell with beautie, is the ſunne to be miſliked becauſe it is bright, the diamond to be refuſed becauſe it is cleare, the pearle to be condemned becauſe it is orient, or wemen to be diſpiſed becauſe they be beautiful, when it is the onely doury it hath pleaſed God to beſtowe amongeſt them, the more to ſhew the maieſtie of his handy worke: But you inferre it cauſeth men to doat, and to whom do you impute the fault, would you haue wemen to eclipſe that perfection which them ſelues cannot hide, without preiudice to their creator: but hee that ſtandeth to néere the fire, let him blame but himſelfe, if he bee ſcorcht with the flame: Marcus Aurelius, wrighting to the lady
Lidia, proueth by his Philoſophy, that it is a token of greate ſimplicity, not to deſcry the perfection of beautie, and an argument of greater folly, not to deſire it: Now you begin to quarrell with wemens apparrell, but you are in this matter either not well informed or elſe to forward in iudgment, ſéeing this curioſitie (as you terme it) is alowed to wemen, with more authoritie then you thinke, for wemen being onely created for the pleſure of man, why might it not be thought, that God him ſelfe ſturres that opinion in her, to giue contentment to the eies of him, for whoſe ſake ſhe was created: Licurgus in his common wealth, preciſlye ordained that maidens ſhould goe bare faced, to the end they might be ſéene and deſired, and by the ſame meanes, the married wiues laboureth to pleaſe (not the populer ſort as Bruſanus imagineth) but her husband to whom ſhe is married, as it is written of the daughter of Auguſtus, who on a day being attired aboue her wonted cuſtome of modeſtie, where at her father taking no greate delight yet for the preſent, gouerning his iudgmente by ſilence, but another time finding her in habit more conuenient to his liking, Oh (ſaith he) howe farre more ſéemelye is this attire for the daughter of
Auguſtus, then that which ſhe wore this other day to the diſguiſing of nature, to whome ſhe aunſwered and that with reuerence: then ſir I vſed my time to pleaſe the deſire of my huſband,
 and now I ſtand to ſatisfie my duty towards my father: The like example was vſed by the good lady Heſter, when ſhe proteſted before God that the ſumptious attires which ſometimes ſhe vſed, carried no other purpoſe, then to féed the liking of that great king Aſſuerus, who had choſen her for his owne, and as the frocke makes the frier neuer the more deuout, and ſo in the attire of a woman lieth no true argument of incontenency, and much leſſe ought her garments to breed anye opinion of her leude life and although the ſuſpitious, be apt to ſpeake ill, yet wemens conſciences being cleare, what other rekoning haue they to make of wicked ſpeches, but that they ar rather of cuſtome then of credite: Beſides this, ſuch is the malice to wemens behauiour, that if any one ſhoulde attire her ſelfe contrary to the vſe of others, ſhe ſhould be noted either diſdainfull of the faſhion, or at leaſt an hipocrite in conuerſation: Wemen are further charged that they loue to haue many ſeruantes, and how cunning they be in their chaung of entertainment vnto ſuch as be ſutors vnto themſelues. In high attempts and marciall excerciſes, our gallantes now doe practiſe nothing but to courte Ladies and to triāll with Gentlewemen, whoſe diſſimuling dealing deſerues a counterchaunge of like qualitie, no maruell though wemen grow to be fond, when it is to pleaſe the fanteſie of men that be foliſh, or who can blame wemen though they iuggle a litle with thoſe men, that practiſe nothing elſe but to play faſt and looſe with them: and although
Bruſanus hath thus generally exclaimed againſt all wemen, yet had he but loked into euery ordinary calender he might find out as many vigillies of holy wemen, as feaſts of deuout men, and in his racking of the ſcriptures it ſeemed his right eye was out and he could ſée but on the left ſide, for if he can finde mée a
Dalida, I canne ſhew him a Debora, if he can turne me to be a
Ieſabell, I can ſéeke out him a Iudith, and although ſome men through wemen hath falne into the rebuke of the world, hath ther not béene as infortunate wemen that hath béene ruinated by the treaſon of men, as Medea by Iaſon; Philis by Demophoon: Dido by Eneas: Ariadua by Theſius: with manye others, if it were néedefull heere to rehearſe them: The reſt of your words, which ſerueth to no other purpoſe but to depraue,
 there néedeth no other aunſwere but that they were ſpoken of ſpight: and the woman of good life, feareth no ſlaunderous tongues, and a cleare conſcience, neither néedes excuſe, nor feareth accuſation: See now, what is become of this terrible tempeſt, where he manye malicious boults haue béene thundred for the againſt wemen, alas it is ouer-paſte withoute anye daunger, for the beſte ſubſtaunce were but puffes of winde, ſuche as mighte make a noyſe, but doe no hurte at all: But what a labyrinth ſhould I nowe enter into, if I ſhould take vppon me to write in the commendation of women, that haue aſpired in the deepe capacity of artes and ſciences, and therein ſo profoundly, that men ſhould not onely haue cauſe to praiſe, but alſo to wonder at them. Hiſtories are plentifully repleniſhed, where mention is made of Nycoſtrata, called alſo Carmenta, for the eloquence ſhee had in verſifieng, of
Laſterna and Axiothea, two woorthy dames moſt highly renowned amongſt the ſchollers of Plato, of Arethea, that wrot fourty ſeuerall bookes who read openly in the ſchoolles, and had a hundred and fifty Philoſophers that were his ſchollers, of Aſpaſia that inſtructed Pericles of lelia Sabina ſo renowned in Rome for hir letters of Amataſunta, and others like learned in the latin. But wherein haue women bin inferiour to men in vertuous life, who more framed then Aemelya, Claudia, Tuſia, Nycaulia: For gouernment who more prouident then Zenobia, for wiſedome Saba that opoſed Salomon: for actiuity in war, Penthaſile: for poeſy, Sapho: for policy, Zoe: for poetry, Thalia: for rethoricke, Helerna: for oratory, Cornelia: for eloquence, Hortenſia: amongſt the elementall gods is there not (for matter of warre) aſwell the goddeſſe Bellona, as the god Mars: and for ſcience and wiſedome, is there not a
Pallas aſwell as Apollo: for poeſy, or verfifieng are not the nine Muſes as famous as Phebus: By this you may ſée there was yet neuer man ſo profound in any knowledge, but there hath bin a woman to ſecond him, further more, theſe vertues of
Iuſtice, Temperaunce, Fortitude, Patience, Pittie, Mercie, Charity, Humility, and many other like, ar all of the feminie gender: yea the very Church of god is compared to a woman, and figured forth in femall ſhape. But yet a little better to
 make triall of wemens perfections, we will examine their firſt creation, wherein is to be noted the ſubſtaunce whereof they were formed, which was of the purified mettall of man, the place where they were created, which was paradice, the time of their creation, which was the laſt, and therefore the perfitteſt handiworke of the creator, the cauſe why they were created, which was to be comfortable aſſiſtantes to men: through the ſinne of a man, death and damnation were incydent to all humaine poſterity, by the ſeede of a woman, life & ſaluation was purchaced to all true beleuers, after Chriſtes natiuity, during the time of his abode heere on earth, who conſpired againſt him, who ſought to perſecute him, who tempted him, who condemned his doctrine, who would haue ſtoned him, who ſaid he had the deuill within him, who would haue intraped him, who practiſed his death, none but men, Herod, Annas, Chayfas, Scribes, Phariſies, vnbeleuing Iewes, yea
Iudas one of his owne apoſtels, contrary wiſe, who loued him moſt intirely, who imbraced his doctrine, who confeſſed him to be a prophet, who entertained him in their houſes, who miniſtred vnto him euen of their owne ſubſtaunce, onely women, Mary, Martha, the woman of Samaria, Ionua, Suſanna, and many others. It was a woman that poured a boxe of pretious oyntment on his head, they were men that murmurred againſt it, and were offended that ſo great coſt was beſtowed vppon him, it was Pilat (a man) that condemned
Chriſt, and deliuered him to the Iewes to be crucified, it was his wife (a woman that would haue ſaued Chriſt, willing her husband to haue nothing to doe with that iuſt man: they were men that carried him to be crucified, compelling him to beare his owne croſſe: they were women that followed to the place where he was crucified, bitterly weeping and lamenting his death: what would you more, they were wemen that ſtill viſited his ſepulcre after his burial, it was to a womā to whome he firſt apeared after his reſurrection: but I dare ſay no more, for as the horſſe knowes not his owne ſtrengeth: ſo if wemen did conſider of their owne worthynes, they would be infected with that pride, which yet they haue not, and men with that malice which yet they neede not: now Bruſanus, by this
 you may conceiue, what leaden conceites hath ouergrowne your reaſonable argumēts: I could wiſh you to be ſory for your erroures, bluſh not to aske forgiuenes, wemen be full of mercy, their propertie is to pardon, if this will not ſuffice, I muſt leaue you to the inſtruction of Muſonius, who in his booke of ſciences writeth thus: It is an impudent part to preſent any thing to publique iudgment, that wanteth knowledge, and the part of an enuious man, to diſpraiſe without occaſion: Doreſtus hauing thus ended his lines, ſent them to Bruſanus with more haſt then good ſpéed (as after it fell out for himſelfe) for
Bruſanus aduiſedly peruſing the circumſtaunces, and finding his owne miſdeaming of wemen ſo manifeſtly confuted, was ſtriken into a ſudaine remorſe of conſcience, and began to confeſſe in his hart the impiety he had vſed, in ſlandering their ſex: proteſting from that time forward to loue and honour them ſo much and more, as before he had diſpiſed them.
            
            
               The eleuenth Chapter.
               
                  Bruſanus renownceth his former heriſies, he feeleth the effectes of loue, and writteth to Moderna.
               
               HEere calling to his minde his vngratfull demeanure towardes
Moderna, whoſe beautie preſenting it ſelfe a freſh to his memory, loue being readye at an inch with fuell to kindell the fire, wrought ſuch a ſudaine alteration in his mind, and ſuch contrary paſſions ſo perplexed his doubtful thoughts, that after a long controuerſie in himſelfe, hee was driuen perforce to yeeld to fancie, and pulling in his former flagge of defiance, intreated for truce, and began to enter parle with
Cupid on this manner: Why howe nowe Bruſanus, what a doubtfull combat doſt thou find in thy ſelfe, is thy lawleſſe liberty turnd to a ſlauiſh captiuity, is thy freedome fettered, are thy ſences beſotted, wert thou of late at defiance with Venus, and wilt thou now ſhake handes with vanity, dideſt thou ere while renownce beautie as a foe, and wilt thou now imbrace her as a frend: haſt thou ſo carefully counſailed others to beware the baite, and wilt thou now ſo crabbidly poiſon thy ſelfe
 with the bane▪ but foole that thou arte, whye doſt thou thus rechleſly rage againſt reaſon, why doſt thou thus fondly exclaime againſt thine owne wellfare, why doſt thou condemne thy ſelfe of that crime, where of thou art not guilty, thou haſt vowed to beware of fickle fancy, but this thy liking is firme affection, thou haſt bin bitten with the ſore of lawleſſe luſt, but neuer taſted the ſweet of loyall loue, bicauſe thou haſt indeuoured to deſiſt from vanity, wilt thou therefore exempt thy ſelfe from vertue, wilt thou neglecte a peereleſſe Princeſſe, whoſe birth may be a countenance to thy calling, in the attayning of whome thou ſhalt gaine honour, nay more, thou ſhalt inherit a kingdome, I marry Bruſanus, there goes the game away, followe that chace, it is no ſmall matter to inioy a ſcepter. I but yet remember thy ſelfe, and thou ſhalt find that thy deſire muſt needes be waited on with daunger: Moderna is promiſed by the king her father to Doreſtus, he againe is thy vowed frend, and wilt thou requit the truſt he repoſeth in thée with ſuch diſloyalty: But doſt thou ſtand vppon doubts nowe
Bruſanus, O fie for ſhame, art thou falſe harted: what feareſt thou the diſpleaſure of a king, if thou by the meanes mayeſt compaſſe a kingdome, and did not Doreſtus tell thée himſelfe that loue was without lawe, what reſpect is then to be had of frendſhip: feare not then Bruſanus, the reſt of thy time hath bin but a dreame vnto thée, it is nowe onely thou beginneſt to liue, now onely now, thou haſt entered into the way of bliſſefullnes, let not then the opinion of I know not what promiſe, bind thée from paying thy duty to nature: With this reſolution
Bruſanus determined to watch oportunities to come to the ſpéech of Moderna, and by chaunce finding her walking in a gardin, comming to her before ſhee was aware of him, as hee begun to open his lippes to ſalute her, Moderna of a ſudaine ſtarted away from him, withdrawing her ſelfe into her chamber, the which ſhee did rather fearing to bee farther tempted with ſo ſweete an aſpecte, then for anye hatred ſhee bare him whome ſhee loued againſt her will: Bruſanus, marking her demeanure, was ſomewhat amaſed, yet not minding ſo to giue euer, he went to his chamber, where he wrote theſe inſueing liues vnto her.
               
                  
                     
                     Bruſanus to Moderna.
                     Madame, although the paſſion which is commonly incident to all wemen (I meane miſbeliefe) hath ouer taken you of late, yet thinke not that either my affections are ſo light as to eſteeme your diſdaine for iniury, or let that loue finiſhe with a braule, which is in me begun and ſhall be continued for euer, vnkindnes may preuaile for a ſeaſon, but not corrupt, and your repulſe may (perhaps) perſwade me to forbeare, yet not to forſake: as nature hath made wemen faire thereby to intangle men: no reaſon but ſome times they ſhoulde bee frowarde to commaund men: but it was a ſwéete pollicy, by a vitter repulſe to renew affection, other doubtes, miſdéemings, or opinions haue I none, but onely this, that my miſtres was froward to make triall, not to forſake, & that my ſelfe am by nature to brooke an iniury to be pertaker of ſo happy a benifit: well Moderna, all miſdéeming ſet a part, grant me your grace and fauour: and I ſhall haue greater cauſe to reioyce then you to ſuſſpecte, and wil alwaye remaine your faithfull ſeruant to commaund, who craueth nothing more then to do you ſeruice.
                     
                        Yours if he be Bruſanus.
                        
                     
                  
               
               This letter being ſealed vppe, he quickly found the meanes to haue it deliuered to the handes of Moderna, who noting the contents of theſe plauſible lines, by the ſame meſſenger returnes him this aunſwere.
               
                  
                     Moderna to Bruſanus.
                     I ſtood in doubt (Bruſanus) whether I ſhoulde aunſwere with ſilence or ſophiſtry, becauſe where the demaund is but a ieſt, the fitteſt aunſwere were a ſcoffe, for dwelling ſtill in your olde error, who will beléeue your newe proteſtations: but to make you to acknowledge your faultes, and to morteſte that madde humour of yours, that made you ſo much to forget your ſelfe, and to bring you againe into your right ſences: I wil not let to pray for you, nay more then that, I would be glad to here a whole trentall of maſſes (beſides other charitable actions) to redeeme you, becauſe I did loue you: but ſéeing your purgatory
 is not pardonable without ſattisfaction from your owne merrites, I can but wiſh you to haue grace to acknowledge it: and by penitent wiſdome to win againe, what your wilfulnes hath loſt: for the many ſeruices you proffer me, if to morrowe after dinner you will come to me that I may ſpeake wich you, if I find your owne words correſpondent to your writings, it may be I will imploy you, till then farewell.
                     
                        Yours if ſhe could▪ 
                           Moderna.
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            
               The twelfth Chapter.
               
                  Bruſanus and Moderna practiſeth ſecret ſlight.
               
               
                  BRuſanus, not able to ſtand of any ground for ioy, miſt not (I warrant you) his appointed time to viſit his lady, who being as ready to awaite his comming, they conuay themſelues to an inward chamber, where for the time, either of them remaines confuſed, with a ſodaine aſtoniſhment of excéeding ioy:
Bruſanus (in the end) breaking of their vnneceſſarye ſilence, vſed theſe words: Though timerity, (madame) hath cauſed me to refuſe your proffered bounty and the déeming of mine owne vnworthineſſe to neclecte your fauorable curtiſie, yet ſéeing the fault procéeded rather from a miſtruſt of mine owne happines, then for any miſlike or other contempt of your greate worthines, I humbly craue pardon for this my fore-paſſed ſimplicity, promiſſing heere-after proteſted faith and loyalty: Moderna taking Bruſanus by the hand ſmilingly made this aunſwere: It is an eaſie matter Bruſanus, to purchaſe credite, where the party is al-ready perſwaded, and to infer beléefe, where euery word is acounted an oracle: but to cut off other friuilous proteſtations, let this ſuffice, thou haſt the victorye, vſe it with vertue: but fearing that my father ſhoulde ſuſpecte our liking, and by that meanes preuente our purpoſe: hauinge as thou knoweſt promiſed me to Doreſtus: I am therefore content to followe thée where-ſoeuer thou wilt be my conducter, and by making an eaſie eſcape from hence, we may line for a time as contentedly elſe where, and being lawfully wedded (for that is the hondes of my loue) it will be no harde matter, to winne
 againe my fathers liking, and in ſhorte ſpace to make ouer returne to the kingdome of Dalmatia, where thou ſhalt receiue the Scepter, in the right of me thy married wife: this Bruſanus is the onely way by which your contentment may drawe on my happines: Bruſanus, who had al-ready taken forth this leſſon, perfectly to yéeld a willing obedience to al his deſires, made this aunſwere: Madame all places are to me both good or bad, as it ſhall pleaſe you to bleſſe or curſſe, behoulde then
(noble lady) what other ſeruice it ſhall pleaſe you to command, I am ready in your affaires to apply my ſelfe with al duty and obedience: After they had a while concluded of their ſafety, and ſet downe the courſe betwéene them howe they might procéede in their enterpriſes, Bruſanus departed to prouide himſelfe for this ſecret flight: Doreſtus al this while, who had receaued but colde comfort from Moderna, that had ſtill driuen him of with delaies, by fortune finding her in a conuenient place, he ſaide vnto her: Madame, ſhall my merrit be repaied with no méed, ſhall my good wil be requited with no gaine, and my long ſute with no comfort, O Moderna let mee yet call thee before the iudgment of thine owne vertue, and now at the laſt, pittie my eſtate, and do not recompence my deſire, with deſpight, nor my lingring loue with loathing hate: Why Doreſtus (quoth ſhe) doeſt thou call it hate not to condeſcend to the requeſt of euery one that woeth, or doeſt thou thinke it cruelty not to yéelde to the aſſault of euery flattering louer, but if this may contente thée, as I cannot be ſo curteous to requite thée as thou deſireſt, ſo I wil not be ſo cruel to deſpite thée for thy good will, let this ſuffice for the ſeaſon, here-after thou ſhalt know more, I haue now other buſines in hand: thus ſhe departed awaye leauing
Doreſtus in a browne ſtuddys what hee mighte make off her wordes.
            
            
               
               The thirtenth Chapter.
               
                  Bruſanus and Moderna are ſecretly fled from the court of Illeria, the King rageth, Doreſtus fretteth, they both intende warre againſt Miletto, King of Hungaria, and father to Bruſanus.
               
               THe very ſame night Bruſanus and ſhe béeing prouided of all thinges, neceſſarily conuaied themſelues away from the court imediatly after ſupper, and taking the aduantage of the night, directed his iorny towards the cōfines of Grecia, leauing his owne country, which way be thought there would be great ſpéede made after him, the which (indéede) fell out according to his expectation: for in the morning that they were both miſſing from the courte, and that the manner of their flight was gathered by coniecture, the king ſent out al the poſtes he had preſently in readines, to belay thoſe quarters towards Hungaria: by this meanes Bruſanus and Moderna eſcaped the handes of the king of Illeria, but yet after that, they fell both ſubiecte to the crewell menaces of mercileſſe fortune, as in the ſequell ſhall be ſhowne, but the king when he perceiued no meane to recouer them, he burſt out into theſe ſpéeches againſt his daughter: O how many incombrances are incident to parents, that are vexed with the practiſes of amorous daughters, for when we haue foſtred, cheeriſhed and brought them vppe to yeares of diſcretion, euen then do they run themſelues to their owne diſtruction, when we hope of greateſt comfort, they do cumber vs moſt with care, and while we are prouiding dowries to beſtow them in mariage of ſuch as we like, they prouide themſelues of parramours, and will not be reſtrained to fancie but whome they liſt, but let vs prouide them of a husband, ſuch as we knowe to be fit for them, and they will liue virgins with a vengence, and ſeeme to bluſh at ſo honeſt a motion, but let a verlet but meet them in a corner alone, he ſhall be entertained without regard of ſham or honeſty but vnhappy Moderna, ſith ye traytor that hath thus inueygled thée, hath not ſpared to diſhonour thy father, I do heere vowe by all the powers of heauen,
 I will make Hungaria to ſmoke for this his facte, his parents ſhal curſe the time of his natiuity, and lament ye euer they brought ſo wretched a impe into the world: The king freted not ſo faſt in his melancholy, but Doreſtus chafed no leſſe in his choller, blaſpheming bitterly both againſt Bruſanus and Moderna, but eſpecially againſt Bruſanus and vnderſtanding the intent of the king was to make warres with Hungaria, he proffered to ſtrengthen his armie, with tenne thouſand Epirotes, and to march himſelfe in perſon with the king, to be reuenged of the iniury proffered him by Bruſanus, the king moſt louingly accepting of this aſſiſtaunce, fell in all haſt to making ready both men and munitions fit for the warres, Doreſtus hath taken his leaue and is departed likewiſe into his country to make preparation according to his promiſe, In this meane time the king had gotten certaine vnderſtanding that Bruſanus with Moderna had bent their courſe towardes Calypha, and minding notwithſtanding, himſelfe and Doreſtus to hold on their determination, againſt Milleto king of Hungaria, he appointed to ſend his ſonne Antipholus, into all thoſe partes about the borders of Crete, to followe Bruſanus to take reueng, to the which iourney Antipholus moſt willingly agred, vnto, and leauing them heere for a time to make all thinges ready, we wil ſhortly followe Bruſanus, but not to haſtily, till hee bee cleare out of daunger, from the borders of Illeria.
               
               Thus endeth the ſecond part of the aduentures of Bruſanus.

               The firſt Chapter.
               
                  Bruſanus by ſtraung miſfortune woundeth Moderna, his pitious exclamation for his vnlucky facte.
               
               
                  
                     BRuſnaus and Moderna, hauing thus paſſed the boundes of Illeria: and being freed from the furie of the king, were euen now ſubiected to the wounderfull munaces of bitter fortune, and thinking
(in their owne conceites) they had eſcaped all daunger, were but then entered, the very path of ſucceeding peril, but Moderna who al this whil had bin tranſported with deſire & troubled with fear, had neuer leaſure to looke with perfect conſideration into her owne enterpriſe, but according to the lawes of loue, like alouer had bequeathed the care of her ſelfe vppon him to whome ſhe had giuen her ſelfe: but now that her hope was ſomething quieted, and the moſt part of her feare already paſſed, ſhe began to looke backe into her owne thoughts, and better to conſider with her ſelfe of her vndertaken flight, and to remember how ſhe had left her natiue country, and had ſettled ſo ſtrang a determination, but yet being nothing diſmaid, hauing in her 
                     〈…〉
                   the partie whome ſhe ſo deerely loued, and therefore caſting no doubtes, on they rid, Bruſanus cheering her with many comfortable and louing diſcourſes, by this
 time they were entered into a mighty forreſt, or rather a huge wildernes, in the kingdome of Calypha, and not far from the famous Citie of Sara, where they had not traueiled long, but they were incountered by a barbarous companye, that were laid cloſe amongst the buſhes to watch for ſome bootye that ſhould come that way, who hauing eſpied Bruſanus, ſudainely beſet him round about, and hee as quickly leaping from his horſſe, and taking downe his Lady, ſet her againſt the body of a great tree, then turning himſelfe with a violent rage againſt that raſcall rout (who by this time began altogether to aſſault him) hee gaue them ſuch a welcome, and beſtowed ſo many bloudy tokens amongſt them, that they began to giue backe, but Bruſanus, throughly inflamed with furie ſo laid about him, that the beſt hope they had to ſaue themſelues was to truſt to their heeles, and thus at an inſtant they began all to fly, Bruſanus following ſo faſt, and dealyng ſuch dole amongſt them, that they were fain to ſcater themſelues euery man a contrary way: Moderna that was nowe alone by her ſelfe and beeing ſtriken with a great feare, forſooke her place and folowed after
Bruſanus, but hauing loſt the ſight of him, ſhe thruſt her ſelfe into a mightie thicke buſh that was by the ſide of the way: Bruſanus giuing ouer the chace retired himſelfe to goe comfort his Lady, and comming by the buſh where Moderna lay hid, ſhee reioycing to ſée her frend ſafly returned, was creping out of the thicket to haue ſhewd her ſelfe to her beſt beloued: Bruſanus hearing the ruſſiling in the buſh, and hauing a ſpeare in his hand which he had recouered from one of the villaines, & thinking it to be ſome of the company that had there hiden themſelues, very raſhly aiming the ſpeare where he ſaw the buſhes to ſture, vnfortunatly hit Moderna cleane through the body a little belowe her ribes: with the blowe ſhee gaue a pitious ſcritch, but not able to ſpeake any word ſhe ſancke down dead to the ground: Bruſanus, hearing the cry, yet not knowing what he had done, came to the place, and looking

                   ſaw his handy worke, and being taught not to ſtand long open deliberations he forth with drew out the ſpeare, then taking her vp dead in his armes he brought her into the plane, where after he had vſed all bootleſſe meanes to recouer her life, his
 perplexed memory had ſtraight ſtlled him with the liuely ſhape of all his forepaſſed miſeries, and the rememberaunce of his former fortunes, with the agony of his preſent miſhap, comming altogether into his minde, and marching as it were in one whole frunte, ſo gauled him with griefe, that with the extreamity of his anguiſhe, his ſences forſooke him and hee fell to the grounde where hee remayned for a tyme, without mouing hand or foote, in the ende yéelding forth a grone as if his harte ſtringes had burſt, and ſtretching his ioynts vppon the gréene graſſe, he came againe to himſelfe, breathinge forth theſe wordes: O fortune, why haſt thou not made an end of my life with the end of my ioy: O bottumleſſe pit of endleſſe ſorrowe, how canſt thou ridde thy ſelfe being fettered with the euerlaſting conſideration of thy miſerable fortunes: thou haſt béene a paricide to thy father, in ſéeking to deſtroy him by thy diſobedience: a poyſon to the country, infecting it with the example of thy vngratious life: a traitor to thy friend, robbing him of ſuch a treaſure, whereof he was a thouſand times more worthy then thy ſelfe: and now thou haſt béene a murtherer, a butcher to her that was the exampler of all vertue, and the very onelye ornament that garniſhed the whole worlde: O ſorrowe, nowe thou haſt the full ſacke of my curſſed corpes, and comfort thou art now extinguiſhed becauſe I cannot hope, and what can I hope for when death hath diuorſed me from the exampler of al vertue: wilt thou ſeeke then to prolong thy wretched life, no: cut off thy curſed daies, and who can be ſo fit an executioner as thine owne handes being acceſſarie to ſoe bloudie a facte, ſo that in killing thy ſelfe, they ſhall ſuffer their owne puniſhment: Then turning himſelfe towardes the breathleſſe body of Moderna bedewing it with his teares he ſaide: O diuine ſoule, whoſe vertues can poſſeſſe no leſſe, then the higheſt part of heauen, beholde his teares, whoſe hart dothe melt in griefe, but if any mercye be reſting in the ſkies, or any loue be left to conſider of a friend: if the heauenly powers, may behold our earthly ſorrowes: accept his life for ſacrifice, that hath no other recompence, and would beſtowe a thouſand liues to view thy heauenly face: Then taking the ſpéere where-with he had wounded Moderna, and ſetting it directly againſt his
 harte, minding to throwe himſelfe vppon it: he ſaide: Death, now do thy worſt, and ſpare not to aſſaile the moſt vnfortunate wretch that liueth, ſuffer him not to apeare amongeſt men, nor to receiue common ſepulture: then making a little pauſe hee ſaide further: but alas deathe is the end of all miſeries: what reaſon haue I then to cut off a wretched life, by a ſpéedy death: if I maintaine my life it is to abide farre greater torments then are in death: liue then Bruſanus, liue, but liue ſtill to languiſh in thine owne euiles: then throwing the ſpeare from him he ſaide: And whether ſhal I recommend the protection of this my wretched corpes, to the earth, why it ſhuneth to be increaſed by the reliques of my ſhamed car caſe: to the heauens, Oh vnſpeakable tormente of conſcience, which dare not looke towardes them, whether then witt thou lead this captiuitye of thine: thou art not worthy to liue amongeſt men, that art a foe to nature: and it is to late to ſpeake any comfort in the angry gods: helpe then you infernall furies, helpe him (I ſay) that dedicates himſelfe to your deuotions: whoſe helliſhe rage is fit for your ſeruice: whoſe guilty conſcience may neuer admit of comfort: Thou ſunne, diſdaine heere-after to ſhine on ſo curſſed a creature: Citties deny to harbour him: men, abhorre him: wemen diſpiſe him worthely, that depraued you wrongfully.
Diana, graunte him no ſhrowd in the forreſt: Ceres, let him ſtarue for breade: you dropping heauenes, vouchſafe him no moyſture: thou earth drye vppe all thy welſprings where he ſhall come, yea let mine eies, be depriued of their light: let my tongue, ſhewe no vſe but bemone mine owne wretchednes, let my hart, be the ſeat of infernal ſorrow: let my ſoule with endleſſe anguiſhe of his conſcience, become his owne tormenter.
            
            
               
               The ſecond Chapter.
               
                  Bruſanus leaueth Moderna for dead, he bereaueth himſelfe of humaine ſocietie, Eriphila findeth Moderna, reuiueth her and healeth her, Moderna chaungeth her name to Calinda, a generall Iuſte proclaimed for the young princeſſe Valeria, Antipholus brother to Moderna prepareth himſelfe to that Iuſte.
               
               IN this and ſuch like manner, did Bruſanus tender his complaintes, whoſe dolorous paſſions might haue bene pleaded in full aquaintance of al fore-paſſed treſpaces, had enuy it ſelfe followed the action, and rigor occupied the place of iuſtice: In this deſperate moode, and (as it were) more then halfe bereued of his ſences, he left Moderna for deade, betaking himſelfe for euer to liue in this ſolitarie deſarte, diſpiſing humaine ſocietie: acompanied onely with the beaſtes and birdes of the forreſt: delighting himſelfe in nought, but in ſoure diſcourſes: his muſe affording nothing, but lamentable laies: and leauing him here to ſpeake of other matters: You muſt vnderſtand that more then thrée yeares before paſſed, Belizarius king of Calipha was deceaſed leauing to inherit his kingdome, his onely daughter
Valeria, being then not aboue thirtéene yeares of age, in whom nature had ſtriued to beſtow her braueſt perfections, and vertue no leſſe vouchſafed to furniſh forth with preſidents: This yong Princeſſe, the king at ye tune of his death, cōmitted to the gouernment of the quéene his wife and mother to Valeria, called by the name of Eriphila, a lady a greate deale more vertuous then fortunate: for not long after the death of the king, ſhe married againe with Brianto duke of Doletta, a man of great ambition, practiſed in all miſchiefe and moſt ſhameleſſe in his demeanures: It fortuned at this very inſtante that this young Princes, acompanied with the quéene her mother, with Brianto the duke & many other nobles, had béene a huntting in this forreſt: their ſportes beeing ended, as they were trauellinge home-wardes towardes the Cittie Sara: they found Moderna lyeng by the ſide of the way, dead as they ſuppoſed, and ſome of
 them alighting from their horſſes finding her to be wounded, and perceiuing it to be newly donne, one laieng his hande on her breſt to féele if ſhée had béene colde, hee might perceiue her harte ſoftly to beate, being then aſſured that there was life remaining in her, craued the helpe of the Ladies to reuiue her, who hauing in their companies men well experimented both in Phiſicke and Chirurgery, they recouered life in her againe, though not able to make them vnderſtand the manner of her misfortune, the quéene Eriphila cauſed her to be brought into her owne cotche, and comming to the courte where ſhe had a moſt precious balme, dreſſing her with her owne handes, within fewe daies ſhe was perfectly hole of her hurt, though not altogether eaſed at the harte, not knowing what was become of her deareſt friende Bruſanus: neither durſt ſhée enquire after him, and the rather to kéepe her ſelfe vnknowen, ſhe chaunged her name, from Moderna to Calinda, the which name for the time, my ſelfe will likewiſe vſe: Calinda thus remaining in the courte, attendant of the quéene Eriphila, reſted her ſelfe in this hope, that in time, ſhe might either heare of Bruſanus, or
Bruſanus ſhould heare of her: The younge Princeſſe Valeria being now betwéene 16. and 17. yeares of age, was wooed by many great Kinges and Princes, but al of them ſtil cunningly delaied of by this duke Brianto, who beeing married to the quéene, mother to Valeria, and therefore choſen protector and gouerner of the kingdome of Calipha, till the Princeſſe ſhould be married, pretended ſo much as in him lay, both to kéepe her from marriage, and to put her by the kingdome, which beeing foreſene by others of the nobillity, they ſo wrought in the matter, that a day was apointed of a generall Iuſte, wherein that Prince that coulde moſt valiently demeane himſelfe, ſhoulde haue for his priſe, the yong Princeſſe Valeria, & ſhe for her doury the kingdome of Calipha.
               
               By this time Antipholus the Prince of Illeria, who had vndertaken the perſute of Bruſanus and his ſiſter Moderna, was come into the borders of Calipha, who vnderſtandinge what preparation was made by ſo many gallant Princes, he determined with himſelfe to try his valor amongſt them, the which he intended, rather for his owne exerciſe, then for any deſire he
 had to the priſe, hauing as yet neuer ſéene the Princeſſe: hee therefore ſpéedely repairing to the Citie of Sara, prouided himſelfe of all thinges beſt beſeeming his honour.
            
            
               The third Chapter.
               
                  How Antipholus demeaned himſelfe in the Iuſte, he winneth the Princeſſe, who moſt willinglye ſurrendereth herſelfe, he leaueth her for a ſeaſon, following his purſuite of Bruſanus to Conſtantinople.
               
               IT woulde aſke his héere a very long time, if I ſhoulde diſcourſe at large of euery particuler: as firſt to ſignifie the ſeuerall Princes, accompanied withe ſuch troupes of armed Knightes, that it ſéemed the mightie hoſt of Alexander, when he tooke in hande the conqueſt of the world: then the riches and brauery of their fortunes, with their ſtraung and quaint deuices: the numbers bothe of lords and ladies that came from diuerſe farre and ſtraung countries, but to looke on, and beholde the manner of theſe enterpriſes: the beautie and brauerye of the ladies and gentlewemen, amongſt whome Valeria ſhewed no leſſe maieſtie, then the moone in perfecte clearnes, amongſt the dimmeſt ſtarres, and it were ouer-long, and nothing to my purpoſe, to ſet down euerie mans particuler actions, to diſcribe how many ſpeares were cruſhed, howe many hardye knightes were borne to the grownd, both man and horſſe, and how many wonderfull exploites of chiualrie was that day performed: ſufficeth this, that Antipholus entering the liſtes amongſt the reſt, and caſting vp his eies to the ſcaffold where the Princeſſe
Valeria ſat accompanied with many other ladies, he was greatly abaſhed to ſee her beautie, which he iudged to be more heauenly or aungelicall, then humaine or earthly: this ſodaine aſpects, had as ſodainlie kindeled ſuch a flame in his breſt, that I can deeme no leſſe, but it both fortified his ſtrength and courage, for Antipholus ſo demeined himſelfe againſt al cōmers, that as manye as did beholde him, both wondered at his valor, and praiſed his vertue, and thus he continued from the firſt to the very laſt, the heraulds with the hole company of lookers on,
 adiudged him the moſt worthy of all the reſt, yet was there no man that knewe what he might be, but they all concluded that if his birth & calling, were anſwerable to his valiaunce & proweſſe, that there could not be wiſhed a more honorable match for the Princeſſe. Valeria her ſelfe beating into her head the remembrance of his noble actes, and hearing the opinion of the ſtanders by▪ was deſirous bothe to ſee and knowe him, that had now ſo great an intereſt in her: Antipholus againe, makeing haſt to challenge his dewe, came before the Princeſſe, where vnlacing and putting of his helmet, he kneled downe humbly kiſſing her handes, proffering his further ſeruice in any thinge wherein it pleaſed hir to imploy him: and hauing nowe made himſelfe knowen to the hole preſence, hee further added thus much to Valeria: and although (excelent Princeſſe) I muſt confeſſe mine owne merrit to be nothing, in compariſon of ſo great a benefit, which I hope to attaine vntoo, rather by the vertue of a gratious conſent, then other-wiſe by any thing of mine owne deſert: yet being incouraged by your owne conditions openlie proclaimed at the begining of the Iuſtes: and being intituled by the generall award of the Iudges and heraulds apointed for the purpoſe: I am now accordingly to chalenge that priſe, of greater eſtimation (in mine owne conceipt) then if the ſignory of the whole world had happened vnto me: This Princeſſe
Valeria vnderſtanding him now to be ſo greate a Prince, and although loue had already made entrie in the moſt ſecret part of her hart, by the view of his knight-hoode, ſoe nowe the ſame breach being made wider by the ſecond aſſault of his beautiful lookes: loue entred with banner openly diſplaied, & finding no reſiſtance, tooke poſſeſſion wholy of her hart, ſwearing al her affections, to be his true priſoners, ſhe being nowe wholy ſurpriſed with an incounter of loue and baſhfullnes, mildly made him anſwere in theſe few wordes: Worthy Prince Antipholus, as I am not to reſiſt the ordinaunce of my frendes that he moſt carefull for me, ſo I muſt not gaine ſay thoſe conditious wherevnto I haue voluntarily tied my ſelfe, by publique proclamation, neither do I thinke it fit for mine honour, to make ſhew of ſquemiſhnes to a Prince of ſuch excelent vertue, when the whole multitude are (as it were) eie witneſſes, of ſo great
 magnanimity and proweſſe, you may therefore (noble Prince) accounte of Valeria as your proper right, and Valeria heere voweth to Antipholus, faith, loue and loyallty: The Queene
Eriphila accompanied with the nobility of Calypha, came with cheerefull countenaunce to entertaine Antipholus, thanking the heauenlye powers altogether, that hade vouchſafed ſoe greate good fortune to their yoong Princeſſe, Thus were they all filled with exceding ioy, Bryanto onely excepted, who ſeeing his deuiſes would no longer ſerue, to ſhift Valeria from mariage, was nowe debating with him ſelfe what courſe he might take to bring her to her end, the which he thought to be the ready way for the accompliſhment of the reſt of his purpoſe: and loe, oportunity ſeemed ready to further his intent: for Antipholus (as you haue hard before) had vndertaken this trauell to finde out Bruſanus and his ſiſter Moderna, and hauing yet got no intelligence of them, hee would needes proſecute his iourney to Conſtantynople, where if he could heare no other newes, he would then make his returne, when with a more quiet conſcience, and a better ſettled mind, he might performe their mariage rightes, to both their contentacions: in the meane time he committed his deareſt Lady to the cuſtody of her mother, proteſting, that in what coaſt or cuntry ſo euer he ſhould happen into, that his hart ſhould remaine dedicated to her deuine beautie and vertue, and ſo commending her health to the Gods, he thus tooke his leaue.
            
            
               The fourth Chaprer.
               
                  Bryanto falleth in loue with Calynda, ſhee bewrayeth it to Eriphila, how he is deluded by them both, and of other his vngratious and villianous intents.
               
               
                  Bryanto had nowe leaſure to caſt about, and debating with himſelfe of many holſome attemptes, in the end he honeſtly reſolued with all ſpeede to practiſe the death, both of the Queene his wife, and of the Princeſſe her daughter, by the death of the Princeſſe he hoped to compaſſe the crowne, and by the death of the Queene, he ſhould ſet himſelfe at liberty to take an newe wife. For Calynda remaining in the court

(as you haue hard) attendant on the Queene: although ſhee had ſo cunningly counterfieted her ſtate, that ſhee was not known what ſhe was, yet ſhe could not hide the perfection of her beautie, but ſhe had ſo intangled Bryanto the Duke, that he had many times aſſayed to practiſe her to his beaſtly appetite, to the which bicauſe ſhee refuſed to conſent (led by the rage of his inordinate luſt) he determined to rid away his wife, to that end to marry her. For the performance of theſe premiſſes, he tooke this courſe: he appointed a day to ride into the forreſt a hunting, pretending great ſport, and done only to ſhewe the yoong Princeſſe ſome pleaſure, finding her ſo dumpiſh for the departure of Antipholus? for this purpoſe he had well fed a cupple of ruffians of his owne training vp, the one he appointed to ride before the yoong Princeſſe Valeria, the other ſhould likewiſe be attendant till oportunity ſerued: it was agreed that theſe two in the mideſt of their ſportes, and when they were moſt buſied in following the chace, ſhould ſudainely ſlip into ſome by way with the Princeſſe, and helping them ſelues by the benifite of the couertes, when they had her alone from the reſt of the company, without anye remorſe, they ſhould deſpatch her of her life, then beſtowing the body in ſome ſecret place that it might neuer more be found, they ſhould both of them fly into ſome other country, where beſides ye reward which the duke for this purpoſe had already beſtowed vpon thē, he promiſed ſtil from time to time ſecretly to relieue them with greater ſums. This determination thus ſet downe, in this meantime Calynda had made the Queene
Eriphila priuie to the whole demeanure of the amarous Duke her husband: fearing▪ that hee ſhould haue attempted her by ſome extraordinary meane of force: The Queene nothing doubting of the tale, would needes intreat Calynda the next night to appoint the Duke to her lodging, where ſhe her ſelfe would both ſupplie her place, and abite all other aduentures what ſo euer ſhould befall, and with much adoe ſhe won her to graunt to it: Calynda the next day accordingly, finding opportunity, ſhe told the Duke, that yet in the end, ſhe was moued with compaſſion of his long ſute, and that if it pleaſed him the ſame night to repayre to her chamber at a conuenient time,
 he ſhould 
                     〈…〉
                   it no great matter to open the dore, deſiring his grace yet to vſe great circumſpection, although not for her cauſe, yet for his honour: Bryanto, hearing this heauenly harmony, thought himſelfe already to be a ſure poſſeſſor of his deſires, and kiſſing her handes, vowing many proteſted ſeruices, he left her for the preſent, to whome the reſt of the day ſéemed tedious, but night being once approched, according to his inſtructions, accompanied onely with a Gentleman of his chamber, called by the name of Lucius, whome the Duke made ſtill acquainted with all his vngratious actions, and many tymes vſed his help as a broker in the like enterpriſes, and groping thus together through many darke roomes, they happened in the end to the chamber of Calynda, where puſhing eaſely at the dore, and finding it open according to promiſe, the Duke entered, leauing Lucius to attend his comming out, aſſoone as he was gotten into the chamber hee went to the bed, where leaping in on that ſide, which (indeed) was left of purpoſe for him, and hauing his ſpirites altogether blinded with this ſweet immaginatiō of imbracing his deſired Calynda, in whoſ place (as before it was couenanted) he found Eriphila, the quéen his wife: who with a determinate patience had taken vppon her for that night to abide all accidentes intended to Calynda: But the Duke paſſing forth the night more happy in contemplating this action, remembering himſelfe that the ſame morning was the appointed time of his goyng a hunting, and minding not to let ſlip a matter, which he immagined would fall out to ſo good an iſſue, intending therfore to take his leaue, and thinking now that he had her ſo fully at commaundement, that he might truſt her with all his ſecretes, at the time of his departing he told her that in requital of her courteſie, he meant not onely to make her his maried wife, but verye ſhortly to crowne her Queene of Calypha, in the acompliſhment whereof, he muſt vſe her as a witneſſe againſt his wife, whome he meant very ſpeedily to accuſe of adultry, when her witneſſe, with one other (of whome he was already prouided) would be a ſufficient teſtimonie (according to their lawes) to condemne her to be burnt, aſſuring her further if this ſhould faile, rather then he would be longer cumberd, with her whome he
 did ſo inwardly deteſt, himſelfe would giue her poiſon, or otherwiſe with his own hands, he would make ſome riddaunce of her: The poore Lady hearing the doome of her owne diſtruction, in this manner intended by her husband, you may immagin, was in a pitious plight, but fearing to bewray her ſelfe, with a faint voice, ſhe gaue conſent to accompliſh his deſires: The Duke thus taking his leaue, departed not with ſo great ioy, but hee lefte her perplexed with a great deale of more griefe
            
            
               The fifth Chaptper.
               
                  Valeria in the forreſt is diſteſſed by two villianes, was reſcued by Bruſanus, he conueieth her to a place of ſafetie.
               
               IN the morning, who was ſo early vp & ready as the princeſſe
Valeria, ſhe was calling to horſſe before a great many were out of their beds, full little knewe ſhee what was practiſed towards her, the Queene her mother excuſed her ſelf from riding that day, faining to be il at eaſe, for ſhe vnderanſtding what the duke pretended towards her, thought it not good to let ſlip any oportunitie that might befall her to preuent his practiſe: but minding the ſame day, while they were gone a hunting, to flye into Boetia to the king (who was her brother) for the ſafetie of her life: but let vs followe the hunters that by this time were in the forreſt: you knowe what game the duke hunted after, vnhappy man, after an innocent ladies life: but the hunts men rowſed a greater ſtagge, the hounds were vncupled, the duke himſelfe was one of the firſt in the chace, the reſt followed, they all tended their ſport, my two foreſpoken companions watched their time, and hitting on a way that lay through a mightie couert of trees, he that had the Princeſſe behinde him, turned into that way, the other was hard at his heeles, the poore ladye ſéeing one followed ſo faſt, misdoubted nothing, on they rid, til at the laſt they were cleane out of hearing of the hounds, and had likewiſe loſt all the reſt of their company, when one of the verlets ſpeaking to her ſaide: Madame, which of vs twains
 would your ſelfe now make choiſe on to take the firſt fruites of your good will, your friend Antipholus is gone to Conſtantinople to ſeeke aduentures, and I ſe no reaſon but you might likewiſe aduenture of a friend, that you your ſelfe may wel like off, when hee hath ſoe little care ſo lightly to leaue you: The Princeſſe amaſed to heare this ſaucye demaund, aunſwered: Preſumteous villaine, how dareſt thou accompt to make ſuche an offer vnto me, doeſt thou thinke I will diſgeſt ſo notable an iniury, no aſſure thy ſelfe I will be reuenged to the vttermoſt of thy villany: Alas madame (quoth the other) and are you ſo ready to ſéeke reuenge for demaūding of a queſtion, when he hathe but honeſtlye ſought to perſwade that by curteſie, the which if it pleaſed him or me, we may bothe conſtraine by cruelty, but content your ſelfe, and aunſwere more directlie, conſent you muſt, and yéelde you ſhall, héere are no flockes of friends to defend you, and if you knewe your owne caſe, you would be glad both to curry fauour, and to ſpeake faire. The poore lady looking better aboute her, and perceiuing her ſelfe to be ſingled out from the reſt of her company, and finding by their preſumtious ſpéeches that ſhe was betraied, replied thus: Alas, the onely limites of your requeſt, is my deſtruction, and your deteſtable demaund, more odious vnto me then death: but if my caſe be ſo hard as you do perſwade, I beſeeche you both to determine of my deathe to the ſauing of mine honour: Well madame (aunſwered the other of the villains) ſome thinge to ſatisfie your deſire (hauing the lawe in our owne hands) we wil firſt ſerue our owne appetites, then after we will not ſticke to ridde you of your life, to the ende you ſhal not longer liue to languiſh in gréefe: This ſaid, they turned out of the way into a mighty thicket of buſhes, as couertly ſhrowded with highe and mighty trées, and the Princeſſe dreading badde meaſure, began in pitious manner to cry out for helpe, but alas in a place ſo vnfrequented, that there was no mortall creature to reſounde an Eccho to her exclamations, the which the villains knowing well, tooke her downe from her horſſe: and forceably caſting her againſt the ground, began violently to aſſault her chaſtity, ſhe ſtil defending her ſelfe ſo much as her feeble force woulde permit her,
 and euen at that inſtant, when ſhe was depriued of al other reſiſtance,
Bruſanus, who lyeng in that deſert in ſuch deſperate paſſion (as before you haue hard) fortuned to come by, and hearing the pitifull ſhrickes of a woman, made to the place from whence he hard the voice, and perceiuing the deſtreſſed Princeſſe, he oppoſed himſelfe in her defence, & at the very firſt incounter, he ſlewe the one of thoſe wretches, the other not able to make longer reſiſtance, fell downe of his knées offering himſelfe to the mercy of Bruſanus, who firſt disfurniſhing him of his weapon, willed him to recompt vnto him what gentlewoman that ſame might be, and what his fellowe and he ment in ſuch villanous manner to attempt her, hee aunſwered thus: Noble gentleman (for your valiant demeanure vndoubtedlye perſwadeth me of your title) for the lady, I will leaue it to her owne confeſſion to manifeſt what ſhe is, for my fellowe who by your valiance lyeth heare ſlaine, his name is Eureſtus, my ſelfe called Vago, both of vs trained vppe from our infancy, in the courte of Brianto duke of Doletta, protector and gouerner heare in this kingdome of Calipha: and both of vs feed by him to haue murthered this lady: and for our better oportunity (it was likewiſe by himſelfe deuiſed) that in the time of hunting here in this forreſt we ſhoulde take occaſion to performe our enterpriſe, the which (after we had both ſatisfied our vngratious apetites) had you not come thus to the reſcues, we had vndoubtedly accompliſhed: Thus ſir I haue briefly ſhewed, we ſhould haue beene the miniſters (though not the authors) of an innocent ladies death, but that it hath pleaſed God (by your good helpe) thus miraculouſlye to preſerue her, no doubte to a better purpoſe: Vago hauing thus ended his tale, Bruſanus, not yet knowing whome he had reſcued, curtiouſly demaunded of her what ſhe was: the Princeſſe dryeng her dropping eies, and proſtrating her ſelfe humbly at his féete, ſhe ſaide: Touching your demaunde, knowe ſir, I am by byrthe a Princeſſe
(though as you ſee vnfortunate) and more vnfortunate (by the ſpeeches of this traytor) then before I was a ware off, in that he ſéeketh to practiſe my death, in whome I repoſed the greateſt ſafety of my life: But woe, yea endleſſe woe befal that vngratefull trattor▪ 
                  Bruſanus, by whoſe villany I am brought to
 this miſery, and whoſe only trechery is the cauſe of my miſhap but alas ſir, what thankes may I nowe render to recompence your curteſie, or how ſhall I be able to reward this your his deſert: Bruſanus hearing himſelfe thus euill ſpoken off maruailed at the matter, but in the end he ſaide: Is it poſſible
(madame) that this Bruſanus you ſpeake off, would ſo preiudice the quiet of a Princeſſe, to giue you cauſe thus to exclaime againſt him: Valeria here diſcourſing at large with
Bruſanus, made himſelfe vnderſtand, that ſhe was the daughter and heire to Belizarius, the late king of Calipha: howe he had left her the inheritrixe to the kingdome. Howe manye Princes ſought to win her loue: how at a generall Iuſte appointed to the ſame purpoſe, Antipholus Prince of Illeria, by his owne valor and worthines wanne her from all the reſt. Here ſhe began to relate the whole circumſtances of the amorous incounters that happened betwéene Antipholus and her ſelfe: and from hence ſhée drewe the cauſe of her quarrell to
Bruſanus, for (quoth ſhe) this mutuall loue being thus confirmed betwéene vs, when I deſired it ſhoulde longeſt haue continued, and hoped to haue ſettelled my ſelfe in a ſtate of greater bleſſedneſſe, euen then Antipholus (to performe a certaine vowe before ſolemnized to his father) would néeds vndertake to trauail in the purſuite of this wretched Bruſanus, who not longe before had traytorouſly conuaied his ſiſter away from out his and her fathers courte: by this meanes am I ſpoyled of my greateſt ſolace, bereaued of that reſt, wherein conſiſteth my onely delight: and by this meanes, yea by this onely meanes, I am left (as you ſée) ſubiecte to the inconſtancy of cruell fortune: Here ſhe began againe very bitterly to rage againſt Bruſanus, who euen then ouer-taken with the guiltines of his owne conſcience, which is euer-more a ſeuere accuſer, and to the impenitent perſon: a moſt terrible Iudge: the very name of Antipholus was a ſcourg to his conſcience, adding newe griefe to olde ſorrowe, and wiſhing with himſelfe not longer to liue a deſpiſed run-agate, knowing that
Antipholus ſought him but for reuenge, and the worſt of his malice he knewe coulde be but deathe, and that was the beſt thing that might betide him: after he had a while debated of
 theſe thinges to himſelfe, he ſaide: Madame, ſoe farre as I can gather by your wordes, the onely thing wherein you accompt your ſelfe to be vnfortunate, is in the wante of your beloued friend Antipholus, whoſe greateſt cauſe of trauel (as you ſay) is to ſeeke out that wretched Bruſanus, a creature
(no doubt (accurſed from his crable: and if this be the onelye fruite to your felicities, ſende after Antipholus, at whoſe returne
(to worke your comforte and his quiet) I will deliuer
Bruſanus into his handes, and in ſuch a manner, as Antipholus ſhall haue aduantage inough to be reuenged of any Iniuries, what-ſoeuer: in the meane time, what courſe it ſhall pleaſe you to directe me for your owne ſelfe, you ſhall find me ready to imploy my whole indeuours to do you ſeruice: After the Princeſſe had geuen him infinit thankes, they fell to conſulting how ſhe might remaine in ſome ſecret place for a ſeaſon, in the end her ſelfe called to mind a gentleman, dwelling not farre of by the ſide of the forreſt, that had béen a faithfull ſeruant to her father, to his houſe ſhe deſired to be conuaid, but the day being farre ſpent, they were driuen for that night to lodge in the forreſt, with ſuch entertainment as Bruſanus had prouided in a caue not very farre off: the next day verye earlie in the morning Vago was their guide to their deſired place, who me Bruſanus reſerued of purpoſe to teſtifie againſt the Duke: Being thus come to this gentlemans houſe, whoſe name was called Fuluius, they were both ſecretly and curiouſlye entertained, where we will leaue them for that night, hauing other matters in the meane time where-with to aquaint you.
            
            
               
               The ſixth Chapter.
               
                  Eriphila pretending flight into Boetia, was intercepted, brought backe to the Duke, he committeth her to priſon, her death is practiſed by a counterfeit deuiſe, ſhe is brought to the place of execution
               
               YOu haue hard before how the Queene Eriphila, to preuent all perills intended by her husband, reſolued to flye into
Boetia, and minding to let ſlip no opportunity, the Duke was no ſooner gon towardes the forreſt, but ſhe (a great deale more priuily then prouidently) fled from the court. It was long before the Duke returned from the forreſt, & the reaſon was, the yoong Princeſſe Valeria being ſudainely loſt, they ſpent much time in ſeeking her, and yet returned without any newes, but the Duke being come home, and hauing got intelligence of his wiues ſudaine departure, wondred greatly what might be the cauſe of her flight, and although he could not coniecture the certainty, thought it not good to ſuffer her ſo to paſſe, but aſſuring himſelf which way to ſend after her, cauſed ſuch haſty purſuite to be made, that ſhee could by no meanes poſſibly eſcape, but being brought backe againe to the Duke, he commaunded her preſently to cloſe priſon: and hauing framed the platforme of her confuſion already in his head, in this manner he meant to performe it. There was a knight reſident about the court called by the name of Arcadyus: a man famed through all Grece for his proweſſe and ſtrength, and one that by his force and chiuallry had performed ſo many notable exploites, that by the generall opinion of all, hee was thought to be ſo ſingullar, as there might not bee found an other to ſecond him: and truely had his vertue bin aunſwereable to his valour, he might well haue bin thought peereleſſe, of al the knights that liued in thoſe partes: but the want of honeſty was a great ſtaine to his honour: this Arcadyus had a daughter of moſt exquiſit beauty and about ſixteene or ſeauenteene yeares of adge, called by the name of Lucina, whoſe looks had ſo alured our licentious duke

(who was quickly ſcorched with the blaſe of euery beauty) and hauing now forgotten his promiſed vowe to his ſuppoſed Calynda, he burnt with ſuch inward deſire to this Gentlewoman
Lucina, that being aſſuredly confirmed in the large conſcience of her father, he immediatly ſent for him, and beeing men of like diſpoſition, it was quickly concluded betweene them, that
Arcadyus ſhould accuſe Eriphila the Queene, as acceſſary to the murthering of her owne daughter the yoong Princeſſe Valeria, and that the matter might carrie the more credit, a cauſe was put downe, what might ſo much inrage the Queene againſt her daughter, and thus it was deuiſed: about ten yeares forepaſſed in the warres holden betweene Aſtulpho king of
Illeria, father to Antipholus, and Canace, king of Boeria, brother to Eriphila: Valdus (being then generall of the Boetian army vnder his brother Canace) incountering in the plaine field with Aſtulpho, was himſelfe ſlaine, his armie put to flight, and the whole forces of the Boetians ſo infeebled and diſcouraged: that Canace (to purchaſe a peace) was driuen to ſurrender to the king of Illeria, the famous Citie of Auarra, beſides other great ſommes of money, in ſatisfaction of certain demaunds challenged by Aſtulpho: Eriphila being yet gauled with theſe griefes: but eſpecially deſirous to reueng the death of her brother Valdus vppon Antipholus, practiſed firſt with her daughter to poiſon him, who refuſing her, for the intire loue ſhe bare to Antipholus, to whome ſhe rather deſired to be linked in mariage, then to wiſh him any miſfortune, the leaſt that might befall, whereat Eriphila beeing wonderfully diſcontented, and fearing her daughter ſhould bewrae her intent, ſhe poſted ouer the matter to Arcadyus himſelfe, and hauing firſt acquainted him with all former circumſtaunces, ſhee laboured him (ſo much as in her lay) both by curtious intreaties, and liberall promiſes, that hee would vndertake priuily to murther the Prince Antipholus: but he loathing ſo deteſtable an enterpriſe, both vtterly refuſed it, and with all dutie and faithfullnes, willed the queene to deſiſt the farther attempt of ſuch odible practiſes, ſo much vnbeſeeming a lady of her eſtate: but her choler ſo much the more kindeled, and the rather for that ſhe was preuented from farther attempts, by reaſon Antipholus
                   ſo ſudainely departed on his pretended iourney: ſhe therefore turned the furie of her reueng (contrary to nature) againſt her owne daughter: and thinking to preuent Antipholus, of his greateſt felicitie, which he eſpecially accounted to be in the loue of Valeria, and minding to reueng her conceiued diſpleaſure againſt her daughter, for denieng to poiſon
Antipholus, and for the accompliſhment of altogether, hauing found a cupple of companions fitte for her purpoſe, the ſtratageme
(of her owne deuiſing) was accordingly performed while they were hunting in the forreſt, where the innocent princeſſe (by the appointment of her vnnaturall mother) was creuelly murthered, and the actors fled into Boetia, where the queene her ſelfe intended to haue met them, ſeeking her ſaftie by haſty flight, fearing that her deuilyſh deuiſes ſhoulde haue broken out: This accuſation thus cleanely coined betweene them, the duke intended the very next day to make riddaunce of his wife, and the rather for the deſire he had to his new bride, which was a perſell of the couenantes agreed on betweene the duke and Arcadyus, that Lucina ſhoulde bee a dutches at the leaſt, but they reſted in hope to crowne her a queene: The next day very early in the morning, the duke crauing the aſſiſtaunce of diuerſe noble men (ſuch as hee knewe to bee neereſt adicted to his owne diſpoſition) conſulting with them of many cauſes touching the ſtate, then making ſemblaunce of great ſorrow, for the loſſe of the princeſſe Valeria, and the rather when they knewe not what account they might render to the world, what ſhoulde become of her, yet ſeeming to carry a hope of her recouery, beeing fully perſwaded in his mind, that ſhe was but ſtraied out of the waye, hauing loſte themſelues in the forreſt, and did therefore thinke it very conuenient to ſend out great ſearch into euery quarter, to ſée it they could find her either aliue or dead. While theſe cauſes were in diſcourſing, Arcadyus preſenting himſelfe before them, crauing their patience in hearing a matter of ſuch remorſe, as to reueale was grieuous vnto him, bycauſe it touched ſuch perſons as he had euer highly reuerenced, and to conceall it, he durſt not, for that it would proue a ſcourg to his own conſcience: he was willed bréefely to deliuer his doubt, & if
 he were by any meanes wronged, they were ther ready to render him right: Arcadyus here (as before it was deuiſed betwen the duke and him) accuſed Eriphila with the murthering of her owne daughter, the manner whereof, bicauſe it is before ſpecified, I may therefore heere omit, but the circumſtaunces were not betweene them ſo cunningly counterfeited, but the matter by Arcadyus was as artificially auowed, and although the diſcourſe were ſmoothed to the purpoſe, yet there was nothing ſo much confirmed his tale to be true, as the quéenes own flight, in that ſhe ſought ſo priuily to ſteal away, & no man could immagine any cauſe wherefore: But the duke hauing giuen attentiue eare to the whole ſpéeches of Arcadyus, ſeemed to the beholders to be wonderfully troubled in his mind, & breathing forth a pitious ſighe, as if his very ſoule had bin paſſionate with anguiſh and griefe he ſaid. Arcadyus, doſt thou knowe what thou haſt ſaid, and whome thou haſt accuſed, aſſure thy ſelfe, if thou art not able ſufficiently to proue as much as thou haſt heere preſented, that beſides the aſperity and rigour of the lawes in theſe cauſes prouided, ther is neither torture, nor any torment that may be deuiſed, but they ſhal fal al to thyſhare: I craue no fauour (aunſwered Arcadyus) and I am heere ready
(according to the lawes) to maintain my right by way of combat, againſt any man that dare auowe the contrary: I take thy word (aunſwered the duke) and for that it ſhall not be ſaid I will ſmoother vppe a matter ſo hatefull to all eares, for any loue or fauour to the peruerting of iuſtice, I doe heere award
(though with a ſorrowfull ſpirite) that to morrowe by tenne of the clocke in the morning Eriphila (whome till this houre I haue ſo tenderly loued) ſhall without all remorſe be burned, as a moſt vnnaturall woman that would conſpire the death of her owne child, and if by that houre (in her defence) ſhe be not prouided of a champion, who by triall of battaile ſhall aquite her of all accuſations wherewith thou haſt heere charged her. The ordinaunce of the duke being thus ſet downe, Arcadyus
(who altogether preſumed of his owne ſtrengeth) although he thought no man ſo hardy to incounter him, yet he prouided himſelfe againſt the time: the duke on the other ſide, thinking his paine now altogether paſt, was deuiſing of his mariag day,
 immagining himſelfe alredy to be a widower, and indeed, by generall opinion, they all accounted the queene to be but as a dead woman, in theſe cogitations the time runnes on, and the nexte morning, without the walles of the Citie on a very fair green, was the place appointed for ye execution, the clock ſtroke
9, & there was no mā hard off that durſt appoſe himſelfe in ye queenes defence, ſhe was led forth to ye place wher ſhe ſhould ſuffer: who with pitious ſighes & ſobbs, bewraied the inward ſorrowe of her harte, which mooued great compaſſion to all beholders:
Arcadius was ready in the place (brauely mounted, and ſtrongly armed) to mainetaine his accuſation, the Ladie aſſuring her ſelfe that her deathe was there determined, was not ſoe much terrified withe the torture, as the ſlaunder, but knowing no better meane then with patience to ſuffer, humbly falling on her knées and holding vp her hands, ſhe beſought the heauens to receiue her guiltleſſe ſoule, and although her body ſhoulde be conſumed by the fury of the fire, that the flames might yet deſcry the Innocency of her cauſe: the lookers on letting fall aboundance of teares, to ſee this pitifull ſpectacle, although they knewe not what Iudgment to ſettle touching her accuſation, yet they all lamented her misfortune concerning her condemnation: It was now a good halfe houre after nine of the clocke, when Arcadius ſpeaking to the executioners ſaid: What is the matter (my friends) that you make ſo long delay, ſpending the time in vaine, what do you thinke theer is anye man ſo foole hardye that dare enter the liſtes with me in this quarrell: if you know any ſuch or if that be your ſtay, let him come forth, and you ſhall ſée I wil ſoone make him repent his preſumption, when it ſhall be to late for him to confeſſe his fooliſhe enterpriſe.
            
            
               The ſeuenth Chapter.
               
                  Bruſanus reſcueth Eriphila by combat, Arcadius confeſſeth their conſpiricy, cleareth Eriphila and dieth.
               
               AFter Eriphila had made her hartye praiers vnto God ſhée was brought to the ſtake, when the laſt act to finiſhe vppe
 the tragedy was to put fire to the fewell, but God who neuer forſaketh Innocents in their neceſſitie, vouchſafed ſpéedye helpe, for this lady now ſtanding (as it were) equally betwixte life and death (though neither fearing the one nor hoping the other) is yet comforted contrarie to all expectation: for a ſeruant belonging to Fuluius hauing béene in the Citie, and learned al the newes: returned directly to his maiſter, relating vnto him how it ſtoode with the quéene, who the next day was to be executed, for conſpiring the death of the young Princeſſe her daughter: when Fuluius had certified theſe newes to Bruſanus and Valeria, after they had a while pauſed on the matter, and had aduiſedlye conſidered of the trechery of the Duke.
Bruſanus would needes vndertake the combat in the behalfe of the quéene, and being furniſhed by Fuluius bothe of horſſe, armoure, and all other neceſſaries fit for ſuch an enterpriſe, at this verye inſtant when the executioners were readye to put fire to the fewell, Bruſanus preſentinge himſelfe before the principall officers ſaid: Is it poſſible (worthy gentlemen) that a poore innocent lady ſhould thus be condemned to dye before ſhe hath béene perſonally brought to araignement, not being ſuffered to aunſwere for her ſelfe, but vppon the bare aſſertion of a knight, if neuer before detected, yet in this caſe, neceſſarily to be ſuſpected: or do you not thinke that the Duke her husbande, who vppon ſmall cauſes became her Iayler, will not vppon leſſe occaſion become her murtherer: but hee maketh Iuſtice the cloake of tirany, and ſhall that bleare your eies not to ſée his ſubtilty: The whole company wondered at the bould ſpéeches of this ſtraung knight, but as there was not any man there that coulde immagine what he ſhoulde be, ſoe not one amongſt them all would giue him any one worde to aunſwere:
Arcadius ſtanding by, ſaide as followeth: Why who art thou, or what art thou called, that wanting courage to performe as a knight, art thus come hither to perſwade with words like a cowarde, dooſt thou thinke thy Philoſophy inough to incunter the pointe of my ſworde: thou haſt béene to ill aduiſed in medling with this mater, that can warrant thée no better then thine owne deſtruction: Bruſanus aduiſedly noting theſe preſumptuous ſpéeches aunſwered: Touching thy demaund, who
 I am, or what I am called, I liſt not in that point to make thée any aunſwere, yet thus much to ſatisfie thy deſire, aſſure thy ſelfe I am a knight (no cowarde) and am come hither to abate thy pride and to chaſtice thy preſumption, that contrary to the order of knight-hoode, thou haſt dared to charge an Innocente Princeſſe with ſo falſe & vntrue an accuſation: and that thou mighteſt the rather perceiue, I am not come hither to perſwad more by wordes, then I minde fully to performe in déedes, I am here ready in the behalfe of the quéene, by way of combat to make triall againſt thée that thou haſt moſt falſely and ſhamefully ſlaundered her. Why then (quoth Arcadius) to the end that I may with the more ſpéede miniſter correction to thy folly, let vs delaye no longer time with wordes, but prepare thy ſelfe to the battaill, for it ſéemeth vnto me, euery minit to be a monthe, vntill I haue taken a full reuenge of this thy witleſſe enterpriſe: Without any more words had betwéen them, they ſeparate themſelues to take their courſe, then ſpurring their ſtéedes with a mightie Carere, they incounter ſhe one of them againſt the others ſpeares ſoe directlye leuelled, and therewithall, ſo ſtrongly charged, that they were both ſhiuered into ſmal peces, the beholders wondered at the force of the ſtrang knight, but Arcadius himſelfe was much more amaſed, who neuer before that time hade felt the like encounter, and being now in a pelting chafe, with his drawne ſword, he turned to Bruſanus, who in like manner was as ready to receiue him, the battail then began ſo fierſly betwéene them, that in very ſhort ſpace they made euident profe of their courage and manhoode, the valiant knightes maliſſing eache at others welfare, finding their armoures ſo good that no ſworde woulde enter, were both of them made ſo angry, that they laied ſo muche the faſter about them: the fight continued a long time ſoe indifferent, that the beholders were not able to Iudge which partye had the better: in the end Arcadius began to rate with himſelfe, thinking that his wonted force had lefte him, becauſe in his whole life time vntill that preſent day, he had neuer mette with any man that was able to indure halfe ſoe long againſte him: Bruſanus againe, knowing his quarrell to be Iuſt, and therefore not offenciue to God, thought himſelfe diſhonoured
 that a periured knight ſhould ſtand ſo long before him: both of them thus blowing the coales of their anger, which wer already ſet on a fire, the fray began againe betwéene them more eager then euer it had béene before: ſo that the whole multitude were filled with great admiration, to ſée ſuch extraordinarye proweſſe betwéene the two knightes, but Bruſanus comforting himſelfe with the equitie of his cauſe, diſcharged ſoe mightie a blowe at the head of Arcadius, that not-with-ſtanding his helmet was forged of ſo fine ſtéele that no ſworde might pearce it, yet the weight of the ſtroke was ſuch, that it brought Arcadius into ſuch amaſement that he tumbled from his horſſe, and fell downe dend to the ground, where at the beholders altogether gaue a great ſhoute thinking him aſſuredlye to be ſlaine: you may immagine this was a comfortable ſight to the quéene, of whoſe ſafetie there was ſoe little hope, that they lefte her ſtill ſtanding bound faſt to the ſtake: but Bruſanus alighting from his horſſe, paced eaſily towardes Arcadius, and ſéeing him lying in ſuch an extaſie, thought it would haue béene to greate a diſparagment to his honour, to haue ſtricken a knight lyeng in his caſe: walking therfore ſome fewe turnes, Arcadius in the meane time recouering againe his ſences, ſodainely ſtart vp, and graſping his ſword in both his hands, ſmote Bruſanus behinde him, ſuch a blowe vppon the head, that his legges began to yéelde vnder his body, and much adoe he had to recouer himſelfe from falling: here began againe a more fierſe and terrible incounter on foote, then all that had paſſed before on horsbacke: but Bruſanus determining to make a ſhorte diſpatche, heaped ſuche blowes vppon Arcadius, that hee vnreuited his right poulderne, ſoe that his whole ſhoulder lay all diſarmed, and Bruſanus marking the aduantage ſtrake him ſo mighty a blowe, that he gaue him there a mortall wounde, where-with
Arcadius let fall his ſword to the grounde, not longer able to make reſiſtance: Bruſanus likewiſe ſtayeng his hand, ſaid vnto him: Sir knight, the noble courage that I haue founde to be in thée, maketh me to pittie thy caſe, haue nowe compaſſion of thy ſelfe, and haſarde not the perdition bothe of thy bodye and ſoule, by dyeng in a wronge cauſe, reſtore the ladye againe to that reputation, wherein thou haſt ſo iniuriouſly ſlaundered
 her, and liue: What (qd. Arcadius) doeſt thon thinke, though fortune hathe fauoured thée in attaining the battaill that my courrage doth faile me, in perſiſting to the vttermoſt what I haue vndertaken, no, I both de
                     ••
                  e thée and that compaſſion, where-with (as thou ſaieſt) thou art mooued towardes me, followe thy aduantage which oportunity hath offered thée, fortune may aſſiſt thee to glory in my death, but in the conqueſt of my minde, thou ſhalt neuer haue cauſe to triumph: Bruſanus finding him in this deſperate reſolution, ſaid vnto him: Vnhappy man, although thou haue no greater regarde to thine owne ſaluation, yet God defende that I ſhould be the inſtrument of thy euerlaſting perdition, neither is it my cuſtome to oppreſſe him that is vnreſiſtable, and althoughe thou denieſt to confeſſe thy ſhamefull impoſitions where-with thou haſt ſlaundered the Quéene, yet aſſure thy ſelfe I haue other ſufficient meanes to make the matter ſo euident, as all the worlde ſhall witneſſe of thy trechery, and that to thy greater ſhame: for the reſt I leaue it betwéene God and thine owne conſcience, beſeching the heauens thou maieſt yet liue to repente, for anye other harme, I wiſh thée none at all: Arcadius, noting the vertue of this ſtranger knight, after he had a little deliberated with himſelfe, was ſtroke into a ſodaine remorſe of his owne conſcience, and hauing loſt the greateſt parte of his bloud by the largnes of his wound, féeling himſelfe now to begin to faint, he called for the principall maieſtrates and officers there preſent, before whom he confeſſed the whole conſpiracy betwéene the Duke and himſelfe, fully aquiting the Queene of all former ſuppoſitions, and he had not ſcarce finiſhed his ſpéeches, but his breath vaniſhed into the ayre and left his body ſenceleſſe.
            
            
               
               The eyghth Chapter.
               
                  Eriphila is reſtored: the yoong Princeſſe Valeria preſented to the maieſtrates, Brianto murdereth himſelfe, Antipholus, is returned.
               
               VPpon this confeſſion they preſently inlarged the queene, ioyfuly reſtoring her to her former honour, and waiting vppon her withall duetifull attendaunce, the multitude gaue harty thankes vnto god that had thus ſafely deliuered their good queene, who had euer demeaned her ſelfe moſt gratiously to all ſubiectes: heere they began with generall exclamation ſo accuſe the duke in ſundry pointes of tirany: Bruſanus, finding ſo fit oportunity, gentelly requeſted the whole company a litle while to ſtay, for that he had a matter of great importance wherewith to aquaint them, by this time they might ſée a ſmal company came riding towardes them, as they drewe neere they might perceiue a gentleman who rode all before the reſt, with a gentlewoman behind him, the man they knewe to bee Fuluius, of the woman they could haue no weting, for that her face was couered with a ſcarfe: then might they ſée an other who was bound as a priſoner, and ſurely garded with armed men, whome they knewe to be Vagoe, being altogether thus come to the whole preſe, Bruſanus humbly kiſſing his hande, tooke downe the gentlewoman, and leading her by the hand before the maieſtrates he ſaid: Behold I deleuer heere amongſt you, your yoong princeſſe, of whoſe fafetie I would wiſh you ſhould haue a greater regard then hetherto you haue had, for the reſt of her aduenture, and what fortune hath betaine her, I leaue to her owne reporte: diſcouering then her face by taking away the vayll, the whole aſſembly knewe her aſſuredly to be their princeſſe Valeria: heere began againe a greater admiration then any what ſo euer had hetherto happened: but Valeria bréefely related vnto them, the manner how ſhe was conueied from the reſt of her company as they were hunting in the foreſt, the villany that was offered vnto her by Vago and his fellow Freſtus, and how ſhe was miraculouſly
 deliuered by this ſtraunger knight Ariſto (for Bruſanus not otherwiſe willing to be knowne, ſo named himſelfe)
Vago confirmed theſe premiſſes to be true, confeſſing further how the duke had hired both him and his fellowe to murther the princeſſe, and how that daies pleaſure of hunting was appointed to no other purpoſe, but for their oportunity to performe that enterpriſe, theſe matters being thus manifeſted, the maieſtrates preſently appointed a gard as well in the defence of the princeſſe, as alſo of the queene her mother, and certaine noblemen were choſen to holde the gouernment in the behalfe of the princeſſe, vntill the returne of Antipholus from
Conſtantinople: The duke by eſpialls hauing got inteligence of all theſe premiſſes, and finding himſelfe to be frunted in all his enterpriſes, and that his whole conſpiracies were thus broken out, being priuate in his chamber onely accompanied with Lucius, the man that was moſt truſted with all his vngratious practiſes, burſt out into theſe ſpeeches and ſaid. O caitife moſt accurſed, hath thy fortune concluded with this conſequence, is this the frutes of thy long premeditated practiſe, haſt thou laid a plot for thy aduauncement to honour, and is it broken out to thy eternall ſhame and infamy, o what elſe what better couldſt thou looke for, hath not thy practiſes bin abhominable, thy enterpriſes deteſtable, thy indeuours hatefull, and the whole courſe of thy life filthy and odible, o that the bowells of the earth would now open and deuour my treaſons, my conſpiracies, and other my ſhameleſſe deameanures, together with this deteſtable body, that the world might be purged of this filthy infection, and the remembraunce of both might dye to all poſterity, but what ſtandeſt thou vppon theſe pointes, thou art nowe to ſit vppon thy ſelfe as iudge, and againſt thy ſelfe to pronounce iudgement, diſpaire then wretch in thine owne wickednes, and let a deſperate death finiſh that curſed life that was ſo prone to miſchiefe, and ſo ready to perſiſt in all deuileſh wickednes: without any further ſpéeches he ſudainelye ſtrake him ſelf through the body with his owne dagger, where with Lucius crieng for helpe, many came ruſhing into the chamber, where the Duke lay weltering in his owne bloud, ſo that in very ſhort ſpace his life vaniſhed, and lefte his bodye
 breathleſſe, the rumour of the dukes death was ſubainly ſpred through the citie, and officers were immediately ſent to examine the circumſtaunces, who to finde out the better certainty appehended Lucius, whome after they had many wayes appoſed, he voluntaryly confeſſed, that the onely cauſe why the duke had ſo practiſed the death of the queene his wife, was for the loue he bare to Calynda, who being many times louingly ſolicited by the duke, in the end an nightes meeting was agreed on between them, when they both confirmed their amorous deſires, and likewiſe concluded the death of the queen,
Calynda hoping to ſucceede for a ſecond bride to the duke: vppon thie confeſſion they attached Calynda, committing her to cloſe priſon, aſſuring her no better fauour, then the aſpirity of the lawes would alot her: Bruſanus being ſtill reſident in the citie, refuſed ſundry rich preſents, liberall offers, and honourable curteſies, preſented vnto him aswell by the yoong princeſſe as by the queene her mother, & languiſhing now in gréefe, with the memory of his former fortunes, he knewe no better meane to make ſatisfaction to Moderna, then to ſuffer himſelfe to be ſacrifiſed by the hands of her brother Antipholus, whome he knewe had purſued him but to that end to be reuenged, reſting therefore in this reſolution, not otherwiſe knowne then by the name of Ariſto: it was not long but Antipholus returned, who was receiued into the citie with great honour and triumph, but what ioy was made by the princeſſe Valeria, I dare not vndertake to diſcipher, and you may well thinke it was much.
            
            
               The ninth Chapter.
               
                  Bruſanus and Antipholus are brought to meete in a gardin, the manner of their incounter, Valeria: pacifieth Antipholus, he proteſteth frendeſhip to Bruſanus.
               
               SOme fewe daies ouer-paſſed thus in pleaſure, in which meane ſpace Antipholus was made acquainted with euery ſtratagem practiſed both againſt the princeſſe and her mother, although the narrow eſcape (eſpecially of his moſt deareſt beloued)
 gaue him great cauſe to reioyce, yet failing of that reuenge he intended to Bruſanus, his mirth was ſomething mitigated, with this gaule of diſcontentment: which being eſpied by Valeria, whoſe eies were ſtill watchfull ouer her beloued, by an eaſte interceſion, he confeſſed vnto her the cauſe of his gréefe: Valeria calling to mind the promiſe Ariſto had before made vnto her in the forreſt, comforted Antipholes, aſſuring him within very ſhort ſpace, ſo to deliuer Bruſanus into his handes, as at his owne diſcretion he might miniſter ſuch puniſhment as to himſelf might ſeeme ſufficient, & although
Antipholus, wiſt not what meanes Valeria, had to effecte ſuch a matter, ſo much by himſelfe deſired, yet he reſted ſomething ſatisfied, hoping ſhe would bring it to paſſe according as ſhe had promiſed: Valeria minding to looſe no time, ſent immediatly to Ariſto to challeng his promiſe in the premiſſes:
Ariſto then ſetteled in opinion as before you haue heard: returned this anſwere, that notwithſtanding hee muſt confeſſe
Bruſanus to be a moſt infortunate creature, yet hee likewiſe knewe him to be a prince, and therefore conſideration was to be had, and that for diuers reſpectes not to betray him openly: but if he might be brought priuily to ſpeake with Antipholus, in ſome ſecret place betweene themſelues, he would not then refuſe ſo to ſatisfie Antipholus in his deſires, as it ſhould wel apeare that Ariſto had well diſcharged the office of a frende, although not to Bruſanus, yet to Valeria: the greateſt matter that was nowe to be cared for, was how to bring Antipholus and Ariſto into ſome place ſecretly to conferre, which was not long in performing, for the very next morning Valeria cauſed
Ariſto to be priuily conueyed through her owne pallace into a moſt delicate orchard, very larg and ſpacyous, and ſhadowed thicke with trees: heere his conducter lefte him all alone, and accordingly as Valeria had commaunded him preſently in like manner to fetch Antipholus: Ariſto nowe being alone by himſelfe and there with all vtterly diſfurniſhed of weapon, the which he purpoſedly had lefte behinde him, and thinking now to finde an ende of all his misfortunes, hee entered into theſe ſpéches. O Moderna, behold thy ſorrowfull Bruſanus, who diſdaining heere his loathſome life, haſtes on his fatall

 gathered ſo much light, as contained no leſſe then the ſafety of her owne life: ſhe began heere to conſider with her ſelfe that Calynda could not poſſibly be culpable in any il meaning towardes her: ſhe therefore requeſted Antipholus that ſhe, might bee ſent for, and that her ſelfe might ſpeake with her

Eriphila, requeſted of Antipholus, that Lucius might yet bee further examined, what time it might be that this meeting was appointed, and the very night of this confederacy: which being accordingly performed, he according to the truth confeſſed it to be, that very ſame night before when ye duke on the morning had appointed his hunting in the forreſt: the queene finding his rekoning to fal out iuſt with her own computation, to diſburden Antipholus from further miſedoubting, ſhe diſcourſed vnto him, her owne practiſe with Calynda, and how with much adoe and great perſwaſion, ſhe had won her to appoint the duke that nightes entertainment in her owne chamber, who had manye times before ſolicited her with louing proteſtation: neither could ſhe denie, nor thinke it any ſhame to confeſſe, but that at that inſtant ſhe ſupplied the place of Calynda, and in a happy time (as ſhe thought it) that was ſo much for her owne good, for the duke immagining

O happy day, yea ten times bleſſed be the houre, when I liue to ſe this comfortable ſight: Moderna imbracing him faſt in her armes, mutually mixing their ioyful tears with louing kiſſes. Of which pleaſant paſſions, wer alſo glad copartners, both Antipholus himſelfe, and in like manner the younge Princeſſe, with her mother: but after the vehemency of their affections, had a little giuen ſcope to the reſt of their ſences, and that their tongues were ſet at libertie: O how manye ſwéete hony words were ſhuffeled out betwéene them (but eſpecially by Moderna) ſoe dangerous to be ſpoken off, as I dare not ſet them hete downe, fearing I ſhoulde infecte wemen with too much kindnes, that are of themſelues, ſo naturally inclined to pittie: I will therefore paſſe them ouer with ſilence, let this ſuffyce: Bruſanus within thrée daies was perfectly recouered, ſo much to the contentation of Antipholus, that all thinges were in common betwéene
 them, the like was betwéene Valeria and Moderna: and after they had a while pleaſantly diſcourſed of euery accident how it fall out and happened amongſt them: they concluded their nuptiales, which they appointed to be celebrated both in one day, for the ſolemniſ

               IT hath béene before mentioned, that vppon the flight of
Bruſanus and Moderna, from the Illerian courte, it was determined by Aſtulpho, immediatlye to commence warres againſt
Myletto King of Hungaria, in reuenge of his ſonnes abuſe, and that his owne ſonne Antipholus ſhoulde followe the queſt of Bruſanus into Grecia, whoſe ſucceſſe you haue nowe harde, Aſtul, ho accordingly leuied a huge and puiſſaunt army, and being acompanied with Doreſtus with 10000. Epirotes in his aſſiſtaunce, they marched in braue and warre-like manner, towardes the confines of Hungaria. The Hungarians, that had long inioyed the benifit of ſwéet and quiet peace, were very much amaſed to heare this ſodaine Allarum of warre, but as no man can perfectly know ye bleſſednes of peace, that hath
 had no triall of the burthen of warre, ſee a long peace bringeth with it many diſcommodities, making men inſolent commonly through to great proſperitie, as alſo nice, lauiſh, & effeminate, through abundance of wealthe and idlenes, and without all doubte, they that are to muche affected to peace and quietnes, do weaken themſelues by little and little before they be aware: & their example doth likewiſe molifie the courage of youth, whereby they lye open to the iniuries of thoſe that wil ſeeke to inuade them: For this cauſe ſaith Philopamenus, in the time of peace, we muſt practiſe our ſelues to be more ſkilful in war, & muſt likewiſe enter into where, but to ye end to eſtabliſh peace, but ye 
                  Hungarians neglecting this principle, bound thēſelues prentiſes, ſo much to this peaceable deſire, that they had both forgotten their martiall diſciplines & vtterly ſhaken of their militarynes, but common neceſſity inforced them to armes, the enimie as they hard was marching, and they had no reſpite now to forethinke them what ſhould haue bin done, but ſpeedily to determine what muſt bee done, they preſently therefore fel to muſtering throughout their whole prouinces, and in euery corner of the kingdome of Hungaria, great multitudes of men were prouided and armed, captaines, and leaders were appointed, ſuch as had neuer ſeene enſigne diſplaied in the fielde, vnleſſe perhaps at the fetching home of a may pole: ſome that were lately come from the court and had carried pantoffelles, ſome as newly come from ſchole, and had read Vigeſius: ſome old ſouldiers that had bin trained in a noble mans chamber, ſome that was able to marciall whole millions with their penne, yet knewe not how to charg their pike: ſome that would haue ouer throwne an armie with their tongues, yet knewe not how to ſet an hundred in good order of ray: ſome raſh, ſame hairebraind, ſome wilful, ſome fooliſh hardy, moſt vnskilfull, all appointed by fauour, none by deſert: by this time word was brought to Miletto, that a Herald of armes was com from the king of Illeria with ſome meſſage, and the king deſirous to heare his newes, willed him forthwith to be brought in, the Herald without any ſalutation at all, told the king that he was a meſſenger of very ill newes, for in reſpect of the villany offered by his ſonne Bruſanus to

Miletto minding ſo much as he might to dally with the king of Illeria, to the end to win time, hoping ſhortely to be aſſiſted by Cariſto, the nexte day calling the Herald ſent from Aſtulpho he willed him to tell his maiſter for aunſwere, that although he feared not his forces being able euery way to with-ſtand it, yet the care hee had of his ſubiectes ſafetie, & the loue ye he had to preſerue the liues of his, commons had ſuch remorſe in him, thā he rather deſired to continue them ſtill in peace (if it might be had with any reſonable

               THis meſſenger returning to Aſtulpho with this anſwere,
Doreſtus was the man that was appointed for this imbaſſage, the conditions that were deliuered him from Aſtulpho to agree vppon, were ſhort and ſweete: the firſt was that Miletto the king of Hungaria ſhould acknowledge himſelfe a vaſſaill to Aſtulpho, and to hold his kingdome during his owne life from him, paying a yearely tribute of ſixe hundred thouſand duccates: the ſecond was, that after his owne diſceaſe, it ſhould be eſtabliſhed by the whole eſtate, that the kingdome of Hungaria ſhould remaine to the kings of Illeria, and to their ſucceſſours for euer: the third and laſt was, that he ſhould deliner into the handes of Aſtulpho, ſixe of his principall noblemen, which ſhould remaine as pledges, for the performance of the premiſſes: prouided alwaies, that if Miletto could within one yeare deliuer his ſonne Bruſanus, either aliue or dead to Aſtulpho, that then the yearely tribute of ſix hundred thouſand duccates ſhould ceaſe, but the reſt to be performed as in manner afore ſaid: theſe were the demaundes of Aſtulpho, giuen in commiſſion to Doreſtus, and vppon theſe conditions either to conclude peace, or preſent warre: Doreſtus beeing thus diſpatched from Aſtulpho, and being accompanied with a traine of braue gentlemen, departed on his iourney towards the citie of Lariſſa, where Miletto held his court, and beeing
 there 
                     〈…〉
                  , the king was certified of his comming, who beeing in his

                   of preſence, cauſed the Ambaſſador preſently to be ſent for, and ſo much the rather knowing him to bee
Doreſtus, the yoong prince of Epirus, ſo much famed for his many perfections, who courtiouſly doing obeiſance to ye king, bréefely deliuered his ambaſſage: Miletto hearing theſe proud demaundes, deuiſed ſo much as hee coulde to delaye the time
(hoping very ſpéedily to be aſſiſted by Cariſto) aunſwered that he could not on a ſudaine diſpatch ſo weighty a matter, but he muſt firſt take the aduiſe both of his counſaile, and the reſt of his nobility, which done, within fewe daies he would returne him aunſwere, in the meane time, he appointed that Doreſtus with his traine, ſhould be ſumptuouſly feaſted: while they were thus enter tained in the court, accompanied with the gallantes, and luſty courtiers, that peereleſſe parragon Leonida, daughter to the king, attended on by a troupe of braue ladies and gentlewemen, paſſed through the chamber of preſence, and was eſpied by Doreſtus, who ſudainely fixing his eies on this ſweete aſpect, was ſo rapt into a trance with the contemplation of her beauty, that his hart was ſo ſnared in the beames of her pleaſaunt glaunces, that there was no remedy, he muſt yéelde to this firſt aſſault of fancy, but heere it were ſtraung to bee told howe many contrary incounters, toſſed in his minde, ſometimes thinking to preferre his ſute, yet that he thought was follye, beeing the daughter of his profeſſed foe, neither would time ſuffer him to proſecute his purpoſe, nor preſent

                   him to make triall of his loue, and yet to linger ſtill in that eſtate, hee thought was to much miſerye, then he called to his

                   how Moderna had diſpiſed him, and heere he began with diſdainefull immaginations to condemne

                     〈…〉
                   of inſtability, of inconſtanty, of lightnes, of intertainly, and to accuſe them as creatures that were vowed to all manner of vanity: our gentleman thus toſſed with the tempeſtes of theſe contrary cogitations (as the veſſel that is borne with the tide againſt the wind féeleth double force, and is compelled to yéelde to wind and waue) ſo Doreſtus, the more hee ſought to quench his loue by diſdaine, the greater increaſed the same of his deſire, that faineting vnder the force of his inward
 tormentes, he withdrewe himſelfe into his chamber, where ſhutting faſt the dore, he began in this wiſe to diſcourſe with him ſelfe: Ah Doreſtus, thou cameſt hether a captaine, and wilt thou nowe returne a captiue, thy intent was to conquer, not to be vanquiſhed, to fight with a launce, not to bee foild with loue, but how doſt thou thinke to ſubdue Hungaria, that canſt not vanquiſh thine owne affections, art thou able to quaill a kingdome, that canſt not quaill thy fooliſh apetites, no, it will be hard for thée to triumph ouer others, that art not able to maiſter thy ſelfe, yeelde not then to this freſh alarume of loue, be not daſled with the beames of vading beauty, nor inamored with deſire of euery dilicate damſell, for in time ſuch bliſſe will turne to bale, and ſuch delightfull ioy, to more diſpitfull annoy, loue Doreſtus will proue an enimie to thine honour, a foe to thy perſon, a canker to thy minde, a coroſiue to thy conſcience, a weakner to thye wit, a molleſter of thye mind, a beſotter of thy ſences, and finally a deadly poiſon to all thy body: why haſt thou not had ſome triall, hath not Moderna taught thee what frutes are to be found in loue, I hope thou haſt not yet forgot what thou foundeſt by experience, but peace Doreſtus doſt thou ſpeak of loue, or art thou in a dreame, why whome doſt thou loue, is it Leonida: what the daughter of thy poſſeſſed foe, one that wiſheth thy miſhap, & partly prayeth to the gods for thy miſfortune, no ſure, I thinks thou art not ſo fond, ſhe is not thy frend whome thou mayeſt hope to get: but thine enimy whome thou art not ſure to gaine, nor neuer thinke ſhe will requit thy merit with 
                     •
                  eed, or repay thy loue with liking, ono, ſhe hateth thee Doreſtus as a vowed enimy to her fathyr, & thy comming hether is to parte of peace, take then a truce with thine owne affections, and ende thoſe warres which fancie hath begun, in thy ſelfe: but alas beauty hath runge the larum, and loue is the chieftaine and leader of the band, whoe hath alreadye ſubdued my ſences, and taken priſoners, all my affections: and although wit would gladly fight it out, yet will, who ſhoulde take in hand the charge, hath ſurrendered himſelfe, and is already yéelded, and reaſon not able to abide the aſſault, is likewiſe driuen to fly the field:
 Alas Doreſtus, what victory canſt thou hope for, more then to plead for pittie, and to ſeeke mercy at her handes, that may yet haue compaſſion and ſaue thy life: Doreſtus without any further ſpeeches determined reſolutly to trie his fortune, and watching his beſt oportunity to bewray his liking to Leonida, hee found out her haunt where ſhee priuately walked euery day in the after none in a pleaſant gardin faſt adioyning to her owne lodgnig, whether hee ſecretly conueied himſelfe, and being ſhrouded amongſt the pleaſaunte laurelles, Leonida accordinge to her cuſtome pacing vp the allie ſoftely by her ſelfe, was incountered by
Doreſtus, & humbly ſaluted her: Leonida ſomething amaſed with this ſudaine approch knowing him to bee a ſtranger, demaunded howe he came thither, Doreſtus anſwered, by chaunce he happened into the place hauing loſt his way, ſo doe many (quoth Leonida) that ſeeke vnknowne waies, and likewiſe followe their owne wayes, but what hath brought you hither, or who hath bin your guide, my deſire
(aunſwered Doreſtus) to ſée and withall to be ſatisfied, no worſe guide vnder the ſunne (ſaid Leonida) haue you not ſéene deſire pictured both blind and flyeng, aſwell to ſhewe his erroure as his haſt, beſides vnbridled to ſhewe his raſhnes, and howe hardly he can be ſtaied: Doreſtus finding himſelfe thus pritiely niped, was in a quandare howe hee might proſecute his vndertaken attempt, yet in the end he gaue the onſet in this manner: the choice is hard lady Leonida, where partie is compelled, either by ſilence to dye with griefe, or by vnfoulding his mind to liue with ſhame, yet ſo ſweete is the deſire of life, and ſo ſoure the paſſions of loue, that I am inforced to preferre an vnſeemely ſute, before an vntimely death, loath I am to ſpeake, and in diſpaire I am to ſpeed, in the one ſhewing my ſelfe a coward, in the other weieng myne owne caſe, for conſidering what loue is I faint: and thinking howe I am counted a foe, I feare: and ſo it is, that intending to be a victor, I am become a vaſſall: comming to conquere, I am vanquiſhed,
 ſeeking to haue brought others into thrall: I haue loſt mine owne liberty, I came to your fathers court a captaine, but am like to returne a captiue, my charge was to parle of peace, but my chance is to diſcourſe of paſſion, your beauty madame (ah) your heauenly beauty, hath brought me into this bondage, your exquiſit perfection hath ſnared my fréedome: your curteſie onely may frée me from care, or your crueltie croſſe me with endleſſe calamitie.
               
                  Leonida, that had all this while liſtened to his tale, was ſo inflamed with a melancholy kind of heate, as ſhee was not of a long time able to vtter a word, yet at the laſt, as it were in a furie ſhe deliuered this aunſwere: Why
Doreſtus (quoth ſhe) art thou become frantique, or deemeſt thou me to be out of my wits, if thy ſpéeches bein ieſt, they are to broad weieng the caſe, if in earneſt, they are to bad, conſidering the partie, to dally with Venus, that art vowed to Mars, argueth theée to be either a coward or a counterfeit, to make ſhewe of loue, that arriued heere in hate, ſheweth thée to be infected with frenſie or folly, but it is a blind gooſe that loues to heare the fox preach, and ſhee a louing foole that ſtoupes to her enimies lure, and therefore if I ſhould loue, what muſt it be Doreſtus, my fathers foe, the bloudy wretch that ſeekes his life, the curſed enimie to my cuntry, no no, he cannot fauour the ſtemme, that would cut downe the old ſtocke, he little reſpecteth the twig, that tendereth not the roote: he lightly loueth the child, that deadly hateth the father: I may not therefore ſo far forget mine honour, mine honeſty, my parentes, and my cuntrie, as to loue, nay not deadly to hate him, which is a foe to the leaſt of theſe: ceaſe then to ſeeke for loue where thou ſhalt finde nothing but hate, and aſſure thy ſelfe if thou didſt loue as faithfully as thou doſt flatter falſely, yet would I neuer belieue thée, requite thée, or any wayes pittie thée.
               Alas madame (aunſwered Doreſtus) way my caſe with equity, if you hate me as I am a foe to Miletto, yet fauour me as I am a frend to Leonida: if you loath me as an enimy
 to your cuntry, yet pitty me as I am a captiue to your beautie:
Tarpeia fauoured Titus though a foe in Rome, Scilla reſpected Minos. yet he beſeaged Niſus: Tereus the prince of Thrace beeing ſent by his father to defye Pandyon, the king of Athens, was inamoured of his daughter Progne, whereby in ſteede of fatall enmitie, there inſued frendly amity: O what greater ſigne of affection, then where in liewe of hate, there inſueth loue, it is to bee immagined, either a thing confirmed by the fates, or appointed by the gods, then where I haue done amiſe, I will not faile to make amendes, if I haue committed a fault, I am ready to render recompence: and as I haue bin your fathers foe, no we will I be his faithfull frend, if I haue ſought his di, ſquiet, I will procure his reſt, yea I will goe againſt the haire in all thinges, ſo I may pleaſe Leonida in any thing:
Leonida bréefely replied: Doreſtus, your ſudaine liking bewrayes the lightnes of your loue: and this your fond affection importes the ficklenes of your fancy, may hee bee counted a priuie frend, that ſhewes himſelfe an open foe, for your examples, they be neceſſary caueates for ladies to be warned by: for if Progne loued her fathers foe, how wretchedly did Tereus requit her loyalty, for the other two: their gaines were perpetuall ſhame and endleſſe diſcredit, for the one was ſlaine by the Sabines, the other likewiſe reiected by Minos: and therefore ſir to conclude, you cannot more diſpleaſe me, then in ſeeking to pleaſe me, and as for my father be his frend, or his foe, it is in your own choice: but for me, if I knowe no other cauſe to hate thée, this ſhall ſuffice, I wil neuer loue thée, & without any more ſpéeches, away ſhe flung in a great chafe, leauing Doreſtus, alone by himſelf, who leauing likewiſe the place came into his chamber, where a little to eaſe his ſtomacke, he brake into theſe ſpéeches: Of all euill which either god or nature hath laid vppon man, there is none ſo great but either reaſon may redreſſe, pleaſure aſſwage, mirth mittigate, hearbes heale, or by ſome meanes or other may bee cured, loue onely excepted,
 whoſe force is ſo full of rancour, that phiſicke can in no reſpect preuaile to helpe the patient, diſeruing not the name of a diſeaſe, but rather the title of an vncureable miſchiefe: yet importing ſuch a ſhew of contentation, that it ſo inflameth our deſires to purchaſe it, that we care not at what vnreaſonable rate we buy it: if it be then ſo ſtronge, why is it not more ſtedfaſt, if it be ſo forceible, why is it not fixed, perhaps ſo it is in al ſauing in me, I am ye odd perſō on whome Cupide wil ſhowe his cunninge, I am he that muſt chope and chaunge and liue by the loſſe: firſt forſaken by
Moderna, now diſpiſed by Leonida: howe art thou then perplexed Doreſtus, thou loueſt without hope, and therefore liueſt in ill hap, thou hourneſt in deſire, but thou art couled with diſdaine, and her father is thy foe, but if hee were thy friend, dothe not Leonida diſpiſe thee, hath not ſhe denyed thy ſute, diſdayned thy perſon, lightly reſpecting thy loue & as ſmally regarding thy ſeruice: onelye promiſſing this, while ſhe liues to be thy proteſted foe: And what then fond foole, wilt thou ſhrinke for an april ſhower, knoweſt thou not that a deniall at the firſt is a graunt: and a gentle aunſwere, a flattering flowt, the more they ſeeme at the firſt to loath: the more we find at the laſt they loue, hope then the beſt Doreſtus, for loue and fortune careth not for cowardes. By this time tidinges were brought to the courte, that Cariſto Prince of Pyemounte was within three daies iourny, with a ſtronge armye of 20000. Pyemounts, and that the Prince himſelfe would not faile the very next day to be at the courte, as well to ſalute the King and the Quéene, as to ſée his dearely beloued miſtres Leonida, for whoſe ſake hee had vndertaken that ſeruice: Great ioy was made through the courte, at theſe happye tidinges, and no leſſe preperation was made for the receiuing of the Prince: This was a colde comfort for Doreſtus, who no ſoner vnderſtood of the newes, but he could eaſely pronoſticate of his owne ſucceſſe, but when hee had certainly learned that Leonida was diſpoſed by her father
 to Cariſto, and how vppon that occaſion the Prince had vndertaken armes: O how were his cares then increaſed, his ſpirites were troubled with millions of immaginations, ſorrowe had sealed on all his partes, and ſetteled himſelfe in the very bottome of his hart, dollor, griefe, care, anguiſh, diſpaire, languor, with all their accomplices, had diſperſed themſelues through all his powers, and taken the full poſſeſſion of him, as their owne proper right: But Myletto, who had lingered this time, but of purpoſe to heare from Cariſto, and his drift being now dated out to his own deſire, the next day he ſent for Doreſtus, to whome he deliuered theſe words: Prince Doreſtus, I haue throughly conſidered of the proude demaunds ſente vnto me from
Aſtulpho, and wondering at his preſumption, what ſhould moue him to ſende me any ſuch gréeting, as though I were not able to maintaine mine own right, that am an abſolute King as himſelfe, and euery waie his equall, and as for my crowne and kingdome of Hungaria, as I haue hitherto kepte them in diſpight of any enimie, ſo I doubt not but to continue them during mine own life, and after my deceaſe, to leaue the ſucceſſion to ſuch heires as ſhalbe as likely to in counter him and his ſucceſſors in Illeria, as for him or any of them by any meanes to oppreſſe Hungaria, for anſwere therefore take this, that by the aſſiſtaunce of God, within tenne daies, I wil meete him in the plaine fielde, and will giue him battaill, where I doubt not but to chaſe him from out my borders, to his great ſhame and infamy: This is the aunſwere (Dereſtus) that I haue determined on, and now at your pleaſure you may departe in ſafetie, hauing
(according to the lawes of armes) a ſafe condite for your protection.
               The king without anye further wordes lefte Doreſtus, who finding himſelfe to be thus continually croſſed, was at his wits end what courſe he might take, but calling to his minde howe that was no place for him to abide longer in, accompanied therefore with his traine he departed, but ſoe
 ouer-growne with griefe, that he paſſed no houre, minit, nor moment, without wofull warlinges, ſorrowfull ſobs, and ſighes bitterly breathed out, in ſoe much that the Gentlemen his companions ſurmiſed his perplexitie to proceede of feare, hearing of the puiſaunte armye conducted by Cariſto: they began therefore both to comforte and to incourage him, and although their perſwaſions ſerued to litle purpoſe for the curing of his care, yet ſeeinge that his ſorrowe would not ſalue his ſore, but rather increaſe his ſicknes, and that mourning would rather augment his miſerie, then mitigate his maladie, he bare out the matter with as good countinance as his paſſion woulde permit, and comming to the campe, he declared his meſſage to Aſtulpho, accordingly as Myletto had before deliuered.
            
            
               The fourteenth Chapter.
               
                  Myletto ioyning his armye with Cariſto, doth march towardes Aſtulpho, they incounter in fight, howe Doreſtus behaueth himſelfe, Cariſto is ſlaine by Doreſtus, Myletto is put to a retreat, and driuen to ſaue himſelfe by flight.
               
               
                  AStulpho, waxing madde with ire, marched preſentlye into the borders of Hungaria, burning, ſpoyling, killing, and ranſaking all that euer came in his way: Theſe lamentable occurrentes comming hourely to the eares of
Myletto, of the ſpoyling of his ſubiectes, it cauſed him to make the more haſt, and concluded with Cariſto, promiſing
(by the ſacred oath of a King) both to giue him his daughter in marriage, and the kingdome of Hungaria, for his inheritaunce, and thus ioyning their forces togither, they marched towardes Aſtulpho, who was ſtill waſting of the countrie, both by fire and ſworde; and beeing come within a ſmall diſtaunce where Aſtulpho lay incamped, they likewiſe intrenched themſelues for that night. Worde was immediatly
 brought to Aſtulpho, of their ariuall, and how the next day they determined to giue him bettaill, theſe newes were ioyfull to the Captaines and luſty gallantes, for euery man hoping to win fame, were generally merry through the whole campe: Doreſtus onely excepted, who being tormented with vnſpeakeable griefe, began to droupe, making no ſhowe but of ſorrowe, in ſoe much that he was generallye ſuſpected to be a fearefull cowarde, and that dread of daunger was it that draue him into thoſe dumpes, but as they raſhly coniectured cauſe of his ſorrowe, ſo they miſt the nature of his ſicknes.
               The next day very early in the morning euery man fell to his armes through bothe the armies, and Aſtulpho who knewe very well howe to demeane himſelfe in ſuch cauſes ranged out his ſquadrons, and martialled them into one ſtrong and maine battaill: Cariſto in like manner, nothing inferior neither in skill nor courage, drewe out his owne forces of his Piamounts, into a ſquadron by themſelues, whereof himſelfe tooke the conducte, and minded to giue the firſt charge, the Hungarians were likewiſe ordered in a ſecond battaill, in the verye ſtrength and bodye whereof Myletto had his place, & was appointed ſtil to ſecond, ſuccoure, and relieue Cariſto in all occaſions of extremitie.
               
                  Doreſtus knewe not all this while where on to reſolue, for if he refuſed to fight (beſids the diſhonour that the world would alowe him, of which he made the leaſt accompt) yet he knewe if Myletto preuailed, that he had then bequethed his daughter Leonida to Cariſto: againe to enter the fielde, he ſhould ſhowe himſelfe a foe ſo open and aparant, as ther were no meanes left whereby to frame excuſe: While Doreſtus continued in theſe meditations, the battails fell to marching, and Cariſto (as he had determined) charged the
Illerians with ſuch courage and fury, that euen in this firſt incounter they began to recoile, but many were ſlaine on both parties, neither was ther wanting skil and hardines, & their fight continued thus a prety ſeaſon betwéene them,
 but in the end Cariſto preuailed, and the Illerians were put to a plaine retreat, and began ſome of them to fly: Doreſtus ſéeing it hie time to beſtyrre him nowe or neuer, was dryuen out of his dumpes for his own ſafetie, iſſued forth with his Epirots, and charging Cariſto on the flocke of his battaill, ouer-threwe at the verye firſt a great number of Piemountes, the fight here againe began to hold on a freſh, but
Doreſtus hauing receiued a maime vncurable, not by any ſtroke lent him of an enemie, but by the onely conceite of his minde, for hee eſpied in the helmet of Cariſto, a gloue, which he immagined, was giuen him by Leonida, and ſo in trueth it was, wherefore preſſing through the thronge, making waye with his ſworde, he came to Cariſto, drawing him for the loue of his Lady, to with-drawe himſelfe, and to breake a launce, Cariſto (whoſe courage was inferior to none) without any further ſpéeches put the ſpurres to his horſſe, and galloping out of the thronge into the vttermoſt winge of the battaill, as he turned himſelfe, he mighte ſée
Doreſtus, who had likewiſe followed him, and had taken a parte of the fielde readye to incounter him, without anye more a doe, they runne one againſt the other with ſuch fury that they made the earth to tremble, their ſpeares flew al to ſheuers in the ayre, it was not long before they had drawne their ſwordes, then buckling togither with forcible blowes, as either of them ſhewed inough of courage, ſoe neither of them were to ſéeke of cunning, in briefe, after manye breathinges,
Cariſto diſaduantaging himſelfe by his own fierce and deſperat fight receiued ſuch a wound, that he fell ſtarke dead to the earth: Doreſtus that ſawe him lyeng breathleſſe began to let fall aboundance of teares deliuering theſe wordes: O vnhappy and vnfortunate Prince, God knoweth how ſorrowfull and greuous thy death is vnto me, and how faine I would haue giuen remedie in ſome other manner, to that I moſt deſired, neither would I haue ben ſo cruall an enimy vnto thée, but the loue that I bare to Leonida, hath rather inforced it then mine owne nature, and woulde
 to God I might haue béene relieued by ſome other means, & not to haue bought my life with thy loſſe: but as loue is tyranous, ſoe maruell not though he want pittie towardes thee, which coulde not other-wiſe purchaſe it to himſelfe.
               With this he alighted, and taking the gloue from out the helmet of Cariſto, hee mounted againe on horsbacke, and bending towardes the battaill, he might ſee a wonderfull ſlaughter of the Piemounts, but the Captaines and leaders of the Hungarians armie, being men vtterlye ignorant of martiall exerciſe, ſuch as for want of skill neither knewe how to take oportunitie, nor when it was time to charge, letting ſlip all former occaſions which might haue aduaunced their conqueſt, ſtoode ſtill in amaze till the Piemounts being vtterly broken by the Epirots, retired amongſt them in whole troupes for their owne ſafe garde, and the Captaines vnskilfull how to open their ranckes to let them in, by meanes whereof they diſordered quite the whole battail of the Hungarians, and the Epirots following the chaſe, began to beare downe the Hungarians, in ſuch ſorte that they were not able to ſtand before them, the which being eſpied by Doreſtus, he preſently cauſed the retreat to be ſounded, and thus at an instant drewe backe his whole troupes.
               This demeanure of Doreſtus was noted by many, and as generally maruelled at by all, but (indeed) they miſtooke him in ſome-thing, for in trueth they vnderſtood him in nothing: But Aſtulpho, who by this time had raunged his broken company againe into a new order of aray, and knew very well howe to take aduantages, ſet a freſhe vppon the
Hungarians, who beeing before diſordered and not able to maintaine fight, fell to a retreat of flat running away, and the King himſelfe had much a doe to eſcape, but the nighte growing on and waxing very darke, the benifite whereof ſaued a great number of their liues.
            
            
               
               The fifteenth Chapter.
               
                  Aſtulpho marcheth after Myletto, beſeygeth him in the Cittie of Lariſſa, and by periurie ſurpriſeth the Cittie, and taketh priſoners, Myletto the King, Paulina the Queene, with Leonida their daughter.
               
               
                  AStulpho gathering his whole armie together, reſted himſelfe for that night within the trenches of his campe not ſuffering his men after ſo great a victory to reſt ſecure, but kept a ſtronger watch then before he had accuſtomed, fearing that his enimies immagining him to reſt careles in confidence of his late fortune, might take courage to ſet vppon him, but alas poore men they had no ſuch immagination, their greateſte hope of ſafetie was in truſtinge to their héeles: Myletto being left now with a ſmall number of his diſperſed people, hee retired himſelfe to his chiefe Cittie
Lariſſa, where he found his Queene, his daughter, with the principales of the Cittie, lamentinge the generall misfortune▪ and being aſſured that it woulde not be longe before
Aſtulpho would beſeege that Cittie, it was therefore furniſhed with ſufficient garriſons of men, preſentlye ſetting ingyners and labourers, to fortiffie the moſt weake and decayed places: ceaſſing neither day nor night, to put al things in readines, as the little reſpite of time woulde afforde them.
               
                  Aſtulpho, who minded nothing leſſe then to loſe that aduantage, wherwith fortune had already fauoured him: hauing gotten intelligence by eſpiall, that ther were no forces of the enimy nere hand to anoy him, and hauing further learned that Myletto was retired to Lariſſa, he marched thither with as much ſpéede as conueniently he might, waſting and ſpoyling the country as he paſſed, acknowledging the honor of his laſt victory to belong to Doreſtus, who little reioyſing in his conqueſt, marched along with him, perplexed againe
 with a newe tormente, not knowing howe to ſalue the ſore ye which he had already chafed: for he thought with him ſelfe, that if he ſhould make peace with Myletto, letting him vnderſtand the loue he bare to his daughter, that he woulde not except of it, either for the greate domage that he had already done him, or for the band where with he was bound to Cariſto the Prince of Piemount, thinking it woulde be a thing neither reſonable, nor yet agréeing to his honour, in liew of the Princes paines which he had taken to com from his countrie, accompanied with ſo puiſſaunt an army in his defence, and in regarde of the death which he ther receiued in his ſeruice, to become a friend to his foe, and to giue his daughter (before eſpouſed to the Prince) vnto the moſt deadly foe that the Prince had.
               Theſe things (I ſay) did ſo trouble Doreſtus, that though he euery daye coyned a newe deuiſe, yet knew not at night where on to reſolue.
               By this time they were come before the Cittie, where ye Citizens iſſuing forth with ſmall cōpanies exployted many ſeruices to their greate commendations, but their forces were to féeble, they were ſtil ouer-matched with numbers, and were therefore driuen to retire into the Cittie: Aſtulpho ſetteled himſelfe before the walles, and in ſhort time ſo gyrdeled in the Cittie with a trench, that they could neither ſally forth of the towne, nor receiue any newe ſupplies, that ſhould come in their reliefe.
               It were here tedious to let you vnderſtand, the ſeuerall ſtrategems practiſed by Aſtulpho, and ſtill preuented, and the Cittie defended in diſpight of all his enterpriſes: But
Aſtulpho finding his deuiſes to ſorte out to ſoe little purpoſe, brought a ſtronge batterie againſt the walles, which deliuered ſuch continuall and terrible vollies: that a maine breach was made aſſaultable, and a great parte of the wale beſides ſo ſhaken, that it was readie to fall: Aſtulpho cauſed the breach immediatly to be fearcely aſſaulted, & it was by the Cittiezens as brauelye defended, the aſſaylantes after
 great loſſe were put to a retreat, and the defendantes with no leſſe ſorrow lamented their misfortune, for a great number of their braueſt men had loſt their liues, in the defence of the breach.
               
                  Aſtulpho ſéeing his forces daylie to deminiſhe, and all his enterpriſes to be continually preuented, fretted within him ſelfe with griefe, and waxed almoſt woode for anger: Myletto againe, ſéeing the Cittie ſo ſhaken, and their walles ſo weakened, that they wer not able to defend a ſecōd aſſault, was as much ſurpriſed with fear, & taking the aduiſe of his counſail, they cocluded to ſend to Aſtulpho, to ſe if he might be brought to any reſonable condicions of peace, which was accordingly performed: Aſtulpho, who cared not by what meanes he obtained ſo he might win, and minding to kéepe promiſe in nothing, if he could take aduantage in any thing, thought that if vnder collor of Parle he could draw the King from out the Cittie, he would ſurelye intrap him and holde him priſoner, and the better therefore to accompliſh this his deuiſe, he returned aunſwere to Myletto, that he was contented to take a truce for tenne daies, within which time if ſuch cōdicions as he ſhould preſcribe might be agreed vnto, the peace then to hold for euer betwéene them, or otherwiſe at his perrill to abide the haſarde of warre.
               
                  Myletto verye ioyfull to heare of this tenne daies truce, hoping in the meane time by ſome meanes to relieue himſelfe, or at the leaſt to reedifie his ſhaken walles, that were euery houre readie to fall, he confirmed the peace during the foreſaid time as well vnder his hand writing, as vnder his oath ſolemnely giuen, requiring the like of Aſtulpho, who accordingly proteſted, both vnder his hand & oath, to kéepe true peace for tenne daies: The truce thus agreed vppon,
Aſtulpho premeditating what courſe he might followe for the accompliſhment of his intended purpoſe.
               
                  Myletto on the other ſide minding to take oportunitie, the verye next dayt brought labourers to that parte of the wall that had béene before ſo ſhaken with ſhot, and threwe
 it flat to the ground, minding with as greate expedicion, againe to build it vp, and with curtins and trenches drawne before it, to make the place more ſtronger then before times it had beene.
               
                  Aſtulpho, ſéeing ſo great aduauntage offered, the verye ſame night aſſaulted the city, in the breach that by them ſelues was made, and they reſting (as it were) in ſecurity, of their truce before taken, were eaſiely ſurpriſed, a great ſlaughter made of the citizens, ſome part of the towne they fired, the reſt vtterly ſpoiled, and the king himſelfe with the queene his wife, and his daughter Leonida taken priſoners, and brought to the pauilion of Aſtulpho, where they were detained with a ſtronge guard.
            
            
               The ſixteenth Chapter.
               
                  Doreſtus viſiteth Leonida, ſhe chargeth him of periurie, he intreateth Aſtulpho to vſe lenity, but he proteſteth greater cruelty.
               
               
                  DOreſtus who before was priuie to the peace, yet vtterly ignorant of the practiſe, hearing of theſe newes, was vtterly diſmaid, to thinke that a king ſhould vſe ſuch periured diceit for the accompliſhment of his enterpriſes, deſiring yet to contemplate himſelfe in beholding his ladie, the next morning very early he went to the kinges pauilion, where he found the priſoners that hee looked for both to his ioy and griefe, yet diſſembling his owne motions, he ſaid to Leonida, madame, I knowe it is hard, where miſtruſt is harboured, to inforce beliefe, or to procure credit where troth is cald in queſtion, but lady if I had won ſuch a conqueſt, and that you were my captiue, yet would I honour you as my ſoueraigne, and obey you as a louing ſubiect.
               
                  Leonida not willing to abide any further ſpéeches, cut him of in this manner.
               
                   Art thou not aſhamed Doreſtus to vſe anye ſuch talke▪ what ſpeakeſt thou of a conqueſt, captiues I confeſſe we be, but not to a worthy conquerour, but to a wretched captiue, not vanquiſhed by proweſſe, but by periury, not by fight, but by falſhoode, holde thy peace therefore, if not at my requeſt yet for thine owne credit, thy triumph in this victory can be but endleſſe ſhame, and perpetuall infamie.
               
                  Doreſtus, although hee knewe himſelfe to bee cleare of that crime, yet conſidering the ladies cauſe, thought it not good to trouble her with anye replie, but leauing them for that ſeaſon, as he paſſed forth he might behold ſuch extraordinary cruelties vſed to the citizens and poore ſubiectes of Hungaria, that it wrought in him a greate remorſe. This ſpectacle, with the remembraunce of his Ladies captiuity, heaped newe griefe to old ſorrowe, wherefore to perſwade Aſtulpho to the more clemency, he cam vnto him, to whome hee ſaid in this manner, though it bee glorious
(moſt mightie king) to ouer-come by battaile, yet it is more glorious to ouercome by pitty, & he deſerueth greater praiſe which winneth the harts of his enimies in his tentes by good example, then in the field by ſheading of bloud, pardon hath euer ben better then reueng, the one beeing proper to the ſpirite of man, the other to cruell beaſtes.
               Neither can any victory bee called true and perfect, but that which carrieth with it ſome clemency, for to ouercome is a humaine thing, but to pardon is deuine, heere of it is ſaid, that we eſteeme the greatnes of the immortall gods, not ſo much for the puniſhment, as for the mercy that they vſe, and although mens lawes avouch it to be more iuſt to reueng an iniury receiued, then to offer it to an other, yet nature teacheth vs, that both the one and the other do proceede of like imbecilyte: vnder your gratious correction then, it ſeemeth vnto me to great ſeuerity to afflict the adged father for the offence of the light headed ſon, or at the leaſt ſo to limitte your reuenge, that it be not rather called a tirany then a puniſhment.
               
                   Why Doreſtus (aunſwered Aſtulpho) art thou yet to learne, that the offence of the children ſhould bee puniſhed in the parentes, haſt thou not hard of the lawe eſtabliſhed by our auncitors, called Falcidia, by which it was inacted, that the child ſhould be admoniſhed for the firſt offence, for the ſecond chaſtiſed, for the third hanged, and the father likewiſe baniſhed as partaker of his fault, for want of good education and inſtruction of his ſonne.
               The Heluetians had an auntient lawe, that if a youngman had receiued ſentence of death, the execution thereof ſhould be done by his father (if hee were liuing) who was the cauſe of his euill education, that the father might in ſome ſort be puniſhed, for the negligence hee ſhewed in the bringing vp of his child.
               Fathers therefore muſt qualifie their children, by bringing them well vppe in their infancy, and letting them haue due correction in their youth▪ which two things being neglected by parentes, the faultes of their children are moſt iuſtly imputed vnto them: and Hely the prieſt was not puniſhed for anye faulte which himſelfe had committed, but bicauſe hee winked at the ſinnes of his children: wouldſt thou then preſcribe limittes, of reuenge to him that hath foſtered vppe an impe that hath practiſed ſo much my preiudice: no no Doreſtus, I will ſo crucifie himſelfe, his wife, and his daughter, that they ſhall al curſe the houre that ſuch a brat was borne into the world to worke my diſpleaſure, neither ſhall their curſing anye whit helpe them, till I ſee their fleſh rotted from their bones, in priſon where I purpoſe to keepe them during life: Doreſtus whoſe hart began to pant with paine, to heare this cruell concluſion pronounced by Aſtulpho, againſt his lady, immediately aunſwered thus: If Machiauell and his fellowes fauourers of tirany, had well weied what wee read in infinit places of ſcripture, that god will ouer-throwe diſſemblers with all their lies and ſubtilties, hardly could we ſéeke to ouercome by diſſimulations, deceites, trecheryes, and ſuche like
 prankes, then if falſhoode procure blame and diſhonour to all men, it doth much more to kings and princes, for where the prince knoweth himſelfe to bee the miniſter of gods iuſtice, with what confidence dare he ſuffer iniquity to enter into his ſeate, which he vnderſtandeth to be the throne of the liuing god, with what conſcience will he pronounce falſhood, out of his mouth, which he knoweth is appointed to be the truth of god: with what bouldnes dare he ſubſcribe to diſceite with his hand, which hee knoweth is ordained to wright the decrees of god, but where we are both iudge & party, in ſteed of iuſtice we ſeeke after force, violence, rigore, deceite, ſubtilty, yea periury rather then faile, and what not ſo we may ſerue our owne turne. Aſtulpho not longer able to indure his ſpeeches he interrupted him thus.
               
                  Doreſtus, if you bee minded to preach, get you into a palpit: and if you meane that I haue vſed ſo many deceite & and ſubtilties as you ſpeake of, you doo me wrong, for in the capitulation betweene Miletto and me, we concluded a truce for tenne daies, but I ſubuerted him in the night, whereof there was no mention made, but what and if there had: haue you not learned this principle in warre, that in conquering of an empire, there is required as great policy as proweſſe, and where the lions skinne will not ſerue, the foxes caſe muſt bee put on, and for the obtaining of a kingdome as wel miſchiefe as mercy is to be practiſed, and better it were to commit an inconuenience in breaking of an oth, then to ſuffer iniury by keeping of promiſe: content thy ſelfe therefore Doreſtus, and let this ſuffice to perſwade thee, as I haue intrapped mine enimie by practiſe, ſo I aſſure thee I will hold him by force, but yet (aunſwered
Doreſtus) if you meane to hold the inocent father Miletto, what ſhall become of the harmeleſſe daughter Leonida: Bicauſe (quoth Aſtulpho,) I will bee ſure to keepe her harmeleſſe ſtill, ſhe ſhall remaine my priſoner ſo long as ſhe liueth, for then I knowe ſhee ſhall doe mee no harme:
Doreſtus ſeeing the nature of the tirante, thought it not
 beſt to vſe any further ſpéeches, but preſently with-drewe himſelfe into his tent, to deliberate with more leaſure what he were beſt to do, to frée his beſt beloued from her threatened captiuity: intreatye hee ſawe would ſerue to little purpoſe, wherefore hee determined by ſodaine aſſault to reſcue the priſoners by force, and ſo to deliuer them from the handes of Aſtulpho: but heere he conſidered his owne weaknes to performe ſuch an enterpriſe, and thought that if he ſhould faile in his attempt, it woulde redounde to the greater perill of thoſe parties whoſe ſafety hee eſpeciallye deſired, wherefore he reſolutly determined, that if by ioyning himſelfe in aſſiſtaunce with the cuntry, he could not accompliſh the performaunce of his deſires, then preſently to retire into Epirus, and there to leuie ſuch ſufficient numbers, wherewith he would ſet frée the princes altogether from thraldome, or to make himſelfe a partaker of their miſfortunes.
            
            
               The ſeuenteenth Chapter.
               
                  Doreſtus reſolueth to ſuccour the priſoners, Aſtulpho marcheth backe into his owne kingdome, Doreſtus vnderſtanding of the king his fathers death, he haſteth to Epirus, he leuieth a mightie armie to followe Aſtulpho into his owne kingdome.
               
               
                  DOreſtus fully reſolued to followe this courſe, and caſting many deuiſes howe to take oportunity, he founde in his account that all deſert wayes were denaid him, and this onely meane left for him to worke by, which was, either by dinte of ſword perforce to effecte his purpoſe, or other wiſe neuer to hope for that he moſt deſired.
               Heere vpon Doreſtus both ſodainely and ſecretely, with drew himſelfe with his whole retinue of Epirotes, vnto a place not far diſtante, which nature had made ſtronge by
 meane of a greate riuer that ran about it, where fortifieng thereſt by art, he purpoſed to remaine, to ſée what aſſiſtance the cuntry would afford him, for the reſcuing of their king, and the freeing of themſelues from ſeruitude.
               
                  Aſtulpho ſomewhat amaſed with this matter, ſent to
Doreſtus to knowe his intent, whoe returned him againe this ſhort aunſwere, that his purpoſe was not to aſſocyate himſelfe with a periured and deceitfull prince, who by a fraudulent meane and diſhonourable conqueſt had ſacked the citie and taken the ſpoile of the whole to himſelfe, it reſted therefore if he would ſet free all his priſoners, or at the leaſt, deliuer vnto his coſtody, the young lady Leonida, that then hee would come to other articles of agréement: other wiſe to account him an open enimie, for ſo he had proteſted to ſhowe himſelfe vnto him.
               
                  Aſtulpho finding out by this requeſt of Doreſtus, the very drift of all his deuiſe, aſſuring himſelfe it was the loue of this lady, that had ſo altered Doreſtus in his former demeanures: therefore to preuent all perills what ſo euer might fall out, and knowing that he had ſufficient pledges for the accompliſhment of the reſt of his purpoſes, the very next night gathering his company together, hee marched awaye with all expeditoin towardes his owne cuntry of
Illeria, carrieng the king, the queene, with their daughter, away with him as his priſoners, the which when Doreſtus vnderſtood of, he thought it ſmall boote for his purpoſe to make any longer ſtay there, but intended as conuenience might giue him leaue to ſupplie himſelfe with ſufficiente forces, to march after him to Illeria, and to this purpoſe he craued aide from the Hungarians, who promiſed by a day to ſupplie him with ſundry regementes, the which with all poſſible ſpéed they fell to making ready: Doreſtus concluding with them, both of the place, and the time of both their armies to méete, marched himſelfe with his whole troupes towardes Epirus, as well to relieue his ouer wearied companyes, with conuenient neceſſaries, as to ſtrengthen himſelfe
 with greater forces for his better helpe. By the way as he was marching, there incountered him a meſſenger with newes of his fathers death. Heere Doreſtus began againe to renue his wonted lamentations, in ſuch ſort, that many daies ouer-paſſed before he would receiue comfort, yet in the ende certifieng himſelfe, conſidering that to render retribution is a duty of nature, and a debt to be paid, either in youth, in age, or at ſuch like ſeaſon, as is not at the diſcretion of man, but at the will and good pleaſure of god, with whome wee haue no power to contende: and againe calling to his remembraunce his vndertaken attempt, and to what taske he had tied himſelfe, found it high time to beſtirre him, and to ſhake of thoſe drowſie dumps, which rather ſeeme the teſtimonies of a diſpayring mind, then the ſhowes of an noble courage.
               It would aske heere to long diſcourſe, to ſet downe with what ſignes of ioy Doreſtus was welcomed home to Epirus, and howe glad his ſubiectes were of his ſafe returne: but
Doreſtus at his comming before he would receiue the ſword and ſcepter, tooke firſt order for the intombing of his father, whoſe funeralls was ſolemniſed with ſuch pompe, as was both fitte for a famous king, and alſo requiſit for a chriſtian prince: this done, he was crowned king of Epirus, to the great comfort of all his ſubiectes, of whome he was generally beloued.
               Nowe he aduaunced his captaines▪ and conductors, that had bin his partakers in this former iourney, ſome to places of credit, others to titles of honour and dignity, and cauſed a full paie to be made to all his souldiers, gratifieng euery man in whome was anye deſert with liberall rewardes, and this great largneſſe of the king, was ſuch a generall incouragement, that now hauing occaſion to leuy new forces, to ſtrengthen and ſupplie his ſmall company with greater numbers, ſuch multitudes voluntarily offered themſelues out of euery quarter, that without preſſing by commiſſion, hee was quickly prepared of a moſt huge and puiſſaunte
 army, and after he had taken order for the due adminiſtring of iuſtice amongſt his ſubiectes while hee was abſent, hee marched to the place which was before appointed for himſelfe and the Hungarian forces to meete, who keeping promiſe accordingly, ioyning their armies together, they marched towardes the confines of Illeria, where they had inteligence that the king was reſident with his priſoners, in the citie Ioula, which was the cheefe citie of the kingdome of Illeria, no leſſe beautifull then ſtronge: thither warde
Doreſtus marched with all conuenient ſpeede, minding to beſiege him before he ſhould be throughly furniſhed to make reſiſtaunce: and thus wee will leaue him marching forward on his way.
            
            
               The eighteenth Chapter.
               
                  Bruſanus vnderſtanding of his parentes captiuity, is vehemently grieued, Antipholus is likewiſe perplexed to ſee his frends heauynes, they make a iourney both them ſelues and their new married brides, into Illeria, to perſwade with Aſtulpho for the libertye of the priſoners.
               
               
                  ANtipholus and Bruſanus, whome we haue a long time forgotten, & wherein I haue done the ladies to much wrong, I meane Valeria and Moderna, for wemen when they be once determined of marriage, they loue not to haue the wedding day deferred, and as you haue hard before, their nuptialls were concluded, and ſo ſoone as thinges could bee prepared, married they were, Antipholus to Valeria, and
Bruſanus to Moderna, all performed in one day, but ſhould I heere diſcribe, firſt the feaſting, the banqueting, the new diſhes that were deuiſed, to pleaſe dainty apitites, the ſtrang faſhons that were inuented, both for men and wemen to make them gaye: the muſicke, the daunſing, the masking,
 the plaies and other ſhowes that were procured for pleaſure, I am ſure it would but grieue you: that you were not there, either to haue taſted of their dainties, to haue brought away ſome of their new faſhons, or to haue bin partaker of their ſportes, I will therefore omit to ſpeake any further of them: but ſée (I ſay) inconſtant fortune, that can neuer be other wiſe then like vnto her ſelfe, who dreaming giueth pleaſure, by little dreame, but waking giueth griefe without all meaſure, ſo in the verye prime of their paſtimes, and as it were, in the mideſt of their delightes, newes was brought, that Aſtulpho had taken priſoners, Myletto king of Hungaria, Paulina, the queene his wife, with Leonida their daughter, Bruſanus hearing of this miſfortune happened to his father, his mother, and his ſiſter, was ſtunge with a vehement griefe, that hee beganne immediately to droupe, being ſo much ouer loden with ſorrowe, as he was not able to indure it.
               
                  Antipholus, againe ſéeing Bruſanus (whome he loued as his owne life) to be ſo much perplexed with care, could not himſelfe reſt in quiet, till hee had framed the plat of his friends contentment, comforted therefore with this hope, he doubted not, but vpon his humble intreatie, both to pacifie his fathers diſpleaſure towards Bruſanus, and to purchaſe the deliuerie of the captiued Princes: and hauing made
Bruſanus priuie to his pretence, there was no remedy but he would beare him companye in this iourny: minding indéede if ther were no other meane to mitigate the malice of
Aſtulpho, to ſurrender himſelfe to his rage and fury, rather then his innocent parents ſhoulde ſuffer endleſſe miſerie through his miſdemeanure: the new married brides Valeria & Moderna, hearing of this vndertaken voyage, woulde in no wiſe be left behind in this iourny, and it was thought by Antipholus, that the feminine perſwations of theſe two Ladies, woulde not a little preuaile to moue his father to mercy: ther reſted nothing nowe to be determined off, but with-all poſſible ſpéed to prepare themſelues forward, and
 their greater haſt, it was thought conuenient, not to accompany themſelues with anye other troupes, more then their neceſſarie ſeruants: Antipholus, knowing that all things were ready, and hauing appointed his deputie, aſſiſting him with ſundry commiſſioners, for the gouernment of the kingdome of Calypha vntill his returne, ſet forwardes (as before I haue ſaide) with a ſmall companye for their better ſpeed: and whom we wil here againe leaue in their trauail.
            
            
               The nineteenth Chapter.
               
                  Doreſtus beſeegeth the Citie of Pula, Aſtulpho intendeth to execute Leonida, Antipholus, Bruſanus, Moderna, Valeria, are taken priſoners, and brought to Doreſtus, which cauſeth Aſtulpho to ſtay the death of Leonida.
               
               
                  DOreſtus, who after manye daies marching throughe
Illeria, without any incounter of his enimies, was com to the Citie of Pula, which he gyrded in with a ſtrong ſiege: howbeit, the impregnable ſituation of the walles without, and the aboundance of men, victuals, and artilerie within, might haue diſcouraged the beſeegers to aſſaill, as the ſame incouraged, they beſeyged to reſiſt, and therefore the barbarous King Aſtulpho (as it were in diſpightful oſtentation) to ſhew how little he forced, or feared his enimies, cauſed
Myletto, with his wife and daughter loden with Irons, to appeare before the walles, and hanging out a banner as though he purpoſed a Parle, that calling for Doreſtus, who being come within his hearing, he ſaid: Doreſtus, becauſe
Leonida (I knowe) is the party, for whoſe inlargment your enemies moſt eſpecially do now ocupie Illeria, if therefore her deliuerie may ſuffice, be not then hopeleſſe, for Leonida thou ſhalt haue, but I wil firſt take off her head: Here withall the executioner whome he had apointed for that but barberie, begines to ſettle himſelfe aboute his buſines, turninge downe the collor of her garment, making her necke bare,
 the better to do his office, a woful ſpectacle to Doreſtus, who was ready to ſincke with ſorrowe, and no leſſe gréeuous to the wretched King her father, who hearinge and ſeeing what was determined, in this manner breathed out the very ſorrowes of his ſoule: And are not my already ſuſtayned wrongs, a puniſhment ſufficient to apeaſe thy cruelty, but thou wilt alſo increaſe my miſery, by the blody butcherie of my innocent child, alas doe not ſo, thy ſelfe being father, ſhouldeſt haue ſome feeling of a parentes affection: O conſider Aſtulpho of thy owne following deſtinie, and looke into thy ſelfe by this my calamitie: I was once thou knoweſt in thy preſent dignitie, but thou ſeeſt what the heauens hath now decreed againſt me: and little doeſt thou knowe what may betide thée, but what my aduerſitie maketh mée to remember, that thy proſperity cauſeth thee to forget, but couldeſt thou conſider of my preſent miſerie, and imploy the poſſibillitie to thy ſelfe & thine, I might then find comfort, not doubting thy clemency, with aſſured hope of my daughters ſafetie. If therefore the example of my fall, the vncertaintie of thine owne fortune, the ſupplication of a King, the ſubmiſſion of a foe, the interceſſion of a father, the teares of an olde man, the regarde of iuſtice, or the innocencie of my poore Leonida, if al this may preuail, to moue thee to compaſſion, beholde Aſtulpho, with my tonge I proteſt it, with my hart I vow it, by the heauens I ſweare it and mine acte ſhall performe it, that her ranſome ſhall be the reſignation of my whole intreſt of the kingdome of Hungaria, to thee and thine: If all this will not moue thee, I coniure thee yet in the name of thoſe Gods that will not faile to puniſh thy tyranie, by the ſhame of the worlde, that will not leaue to ſpeake of thine infamie, by the innocent bloud, that will cry vengance againſt thee, & by thine owne guiltie conſcience, that at laſt ſhal accuſe thee: When thus much was ſpoken and all in vaine: Leonida more perplexed in beholding her fathers griefe, then terrified with the death wher-with her ſelfe was thretened, with a cheerefull voice, ſaid as followeth:
 Deare father, one of the greateſt benifites that can betide vs in this life, is to be thankful to Gods prouidence and neuer to be diſcouraged by any misfortune, no not to ſtand ſoe much in awe of death, that for feare thereof we ſhoulde commit anye thing vnbeſeeming a noble harte, hauing then patientlye reſolued my ſelfe, where-vnto ſerueth your bootles lamentations, where-by my deathe is rather dubled then deferred: for aduerſities albeit they haue cuſtome to vere, yet haue they no power to chaunge the conſtancye and courage of a valiante and reſolute mynde: O ſeeke not then (ſweete father, by your diſcouraginge ſorrowes, ſeeke not I ſaye, to hinder my ſwéete hope, which hope is death: and death is the ſalue to all my miſeries, and yéeldeth aſſured truce to the reſt of my troubles, and knowing in the end, that all things take end, it is not the ill death that we haue to account of, but it is the ill dying that is moſt to be reſpected. Enuy not then your daughters good hap, by ſorrowing her death, but comfort your ſelfe with this aſſured hope, ſhee dyeth an innocent: if I were condempned for ſome notorious ill, perhaps my death ſhoulde diſquiete you the leſſe, but being as I am innocent from crime me thinks it ſhould quiet you the more: Wherefore good father ſeeing that one and the ſelf ſame paſſage is prepared aſwell for the coward as the couragious, for the yong as for the old, being decréed that all muſt dye, if not at one time yet at an other, beeinge farre more miſerable to deſerue it, then to ſuffer it, with the reuerence of a daughter, therefore I require it, and with out the partiall affection of a father, I beſeeche you to graunt it: that you do not more diſcomfort mee by your impatient demeanure, then your diſhonourable enemy ſhall be able to enforce, no not with all his butcherly practiſes: this is the laſt that I may hope to craue, and this is the leaſt that in reaſon you may geue.
               More might ſhe not be ſuffered to ſpeake, but the executioner was willed to diſpatch his buſineſſe, and as hee was lifting vp the ſword to haue taken off the heade of Leonida,
 Aſtulpho might perceiue a company both of men and women that were led as priſoners and brought to Doreſtus, and aduiſedly taking view of the parties, amongſt the reſt he aſſuredly knew Antipholus his ſonne, and Moderna his daughter: this ſight did ſo amaſe him that euery parte of his body quaked for feare, whereuppon he commaunded the executioner to hold his hand: For you ſhall vnderſtand, that Antipholus with that company (as you haue hearde before) trauailing towardes his father, and was come within a verye little of the city of Pula, without any newes at all of Doreſtus, who the very night before had beſet the Cittie, and that very morning ſending forth certaine companies of horſmen to ſcoure the country, they lighted on Antipholus & his companie, who being but fewe in number, and al vnarmed and therefore not able to make defence, were thus taken priſoners, and in this manner were brought to Doreſtus, who ſeeing Antipholus whome he ſo dearely loued, that he diſired not ſo much as to drawe one haire of his heade in anye diſpleaſure, yet knowing him to be a ſufficent pledge for his purpoſe, for policies ſake he drewe his ſword, and comming towardes Antipholus, ſeemed as though he woulde haue ſheathed it through his body, which being eſpied by Aſtulpho, who was ready to ſtucke to earth for ſorrowe, he cryed out ſayeng: O Doreſtus, I beſéech thee ſtay thy hande, and commit not ſo great crueltie, and ſith that fortune hath fauoured thee, with this vnloked for aduantage, tryumph thou, ye 
                  Aſtulpho hath ſubmitted, but imbrew not thy hands in the bloud of the innocent: Doreſtus who reioyced not a little to heare theſe ſpéeches, aunſwered him: Yea marye
Aſtulpho, this is another manner of ſong, I am glade you haue taken ouer a 
                     〈…〉
                   leſſon, do you begin to preach, againſt crueltie: well I hope I ſhall have you confirmeable to the reſt: but for this preſent I will goe to my tent, whether if you will ſend me Leonida, as a pledge, it maye be I will retourne you ſuch conditions, as may proue to your liking: without anye further ſpéeches Doreſtus departed,
 leading as priſoners in his companie, Antipholus, Bruſanus and the reſt.
            
            
               The twentieth Chapter.
               
                  Aſtulpho ſendeth Leonida to Doreſtus with conditions of peace, Antipholus is ſent to his father to intreat for Bruſanus, Aſtulpho being ouer-come with a ſodaine Ioy, ſeing the ſafetie of his ſonne, falleth downe in a traunce and ſoe dyeth, Antipholus ſetteth free Myletto and Paulina, Leonida ſurrendereth her loue to Doreſtus, their nuptialles celebrated, they combyne in friendſhip and end with contentment.
               
               
                  DOreſtus beeing entered his pauillion, he firſt in moſt friendlye manner imbraced Antipholus, bleſſing the houre of his happy aryuall, hoping by his meanes, bothe to attaine to his deſired purpoſe, and likewiſe to conclude, aſſured peace and concord: then turning to Bruſanus, the loue of whoſe ſiſter Leonida, had vtterlye diſſolued, all former conceyued diſpleaſures, and imbraſing him in his armes, he ſaid: O Bruſanus, I can but reioyce to thinke that the enimie to all weman kinde, is yet at the length become a ſworne ſoldyor in the bande of Cupide, and contented to marche vnder the banner of Venus, I hope by this time you haue renounced al your former hereſies: Bruſanus anſwered, yea Doreſtus, and bleſſed be that ghoſtlye father, by whoſe inſtructions I was firſt moued to conſider of mine owne miſtaking, and haue euer ſithens (as a true penitent) both acknowledged my ignorance, and done penaunce for my error, although not able to make full ſatiſfaction for my miſſe: Doreſtus then humbly kiſſing the hand of Moderna, ſaid: and truelye madame your merrit was much in this matter, hauing ſaued a ſoule, that by his owne confeſſion was in the verye high waye to perdition: Then I hope ſir
(aunſwered Moderna) ſith he hath cryed Peccaui, his faults
 be then remiſſiue both to God and the world: Doreſtus, who knew very well wher-vnto her ſpéeches had relation, would returne her no anſwere, but reſting his eies vpon Valeria, whome although he knewe not, yet he ſtoode amazed, to ſée ſuche perfection of beautye, demaunded of the ſtanders by what Lady it might be, Antipholus who could beſt ſatisfie him, tolde him that ſhe was a Princeſſe, the daughter and heire of Belizarius King of Calypha, lately deceaſed, and his wife, but newly married Doreſtus, then kiſſing her hand, began to comfort her, aſſuring her that ſhe was lighted into ye hands of ſuch a frendly enimy, as was ready to do vnto her both honour & ſeruice: As Doreſtus intended to haue procéeded in further ſpéeches, word was brought him that Aſtulpho had ſent Leonida, who was comming faſt by, & was already entered within their Corps de gwarde. Doreſtus, to teſtefie how ioyfull theſe tidinges were vnto him, gaue the newes bringer a chaine that he ware aboute his owne necke, eſteemed to be of great price: and deſiring
Antipholus with the reſt to accompany him, he met Leonida whome he entertained with great ſhowes of humillity, and was neuertheleſſe poſſeſſed, with as much ioy and gladnes, and hauing in his minde, prepared a longe oration for her, his eies were ſoe filled with her ſight, that (as if they woulde haue robbed their fellowes of their ſeruices) bothe his hart faynted, and his tongue fayled: Antipholus then kiſſing the hand of Leonida, entertayned her for the preſent but with a vſuall ſalutation: but Leonida caſting her eies vppon Bruſanus was not a little comforted, in the preſence of her brother, and he accordingly welcomed his ſiſter, with as great ſhowes of brotherly loue, as outwardly coulde be expreſſed: Valeria and Moderna, had nowe their turnes to entertaine Leonida, which both ſaluted her with no leſſe ſignes of harty affection: Leonida being thus welcomed to the company, Doreſtus cauſed 4000. crownes to be deliuered to her conductors, which were foure Gentlemen ſente with her from Aſtulpho. After theſe Gentlemen altogether,
 had giuen humble thankes to Doreſtus for his greate bounty, the one of them deliuered this meſſage from Aſtulpho, ſignifieng to Doreſtus, that the King his maiſter, to ſatisfie his requeſt, had ſent him his ſo much deſired Leonida, in requitall whereof, if he woulde returne him her brother
Bruſanus, he ſhould then finde him confirmeable to his further demaunds, whatſoeuer might be thought conuenient and neceſſarie, for the eſtabliſhment of peace, loue and amitie betwéen them: And although Doreſtus minded nothing leſſe then to ſatisfie Aſtulpho in that requeſt: yet Antipholus, who tendered the ſafetie of Bruſanus, as much as his owne life, and knowing the diſpleaſure of his father, to concerne no leſſe then the deathe of his friend: hee beſought
Doreſtus with great interceſſion, that he woulde not commit an acte of ſuch impietie, for to deliuer a Prince wittinglye to the ſlaughter, were no leſſe then himſelfe to commit wilful murther: Doreſtus reioyſing in his mind, at this vnfained friēdſhip, demaūded of Antipholus if he could deuiſe the meane to pacifie his fathers fury towardes Bruſanus: To this Antipholus aunſwered, that hee had left the kingdome of Calipha, and had vndertaken this ſodaine iourney, but onely to that very end, neither dowbted he, but if himſelfe might come to the ſpéeche of his father, that hee would both mitigate his fathers diſpleaſure towardes Bruſanus, and otherwiſe to winne him to be the better confirmeable for the deliuerye of Myletto and Paulina: Doreſtus who knewe very well that Antipholus would (in very déed) doe his beſt to performe as much as hee had ſaid, and knowing
Valeria to bee a ſufficient pledge, was content that
Antipholus ſhould make preſent proofe of his owne practiſe, the which Antipholus moſt willingly vndertooke, and making no doubt at all of his good ſucceſſe, he departed towardes his father, who was likewiſe attending an aunſwere from Doreſtus, and more then halfe in diſpaire of his ſonnes ſafety, fretting and fuming at himſelfe, that had ſo raſhly ſent away Leonida, before he vnderſtoode what
 was happened to his ſon: in the mideſt of theſe his melancholy fittes, Antipholus preſented himſelfe before his father, and humbly caſting himſelfe vppon his knees: Aſtulpho beholding the ſafe arriuall of his ſonne, was not ſo much before perplexed with exſtreame griefe, but hee was as ſodainely conuerted to a fitte of no leſſe exceſſiue gladnes, & riſing from his ſeate purpoſing to imbrace his ſon, being ouercom with a ſurfet of to much ioy, he preſently ſanck dead to the earth, neither could hee euer after be recouered, by any artificiall meane what ſo euer could be imployde: I will not ſtande heere to figure forth the dolorous complaintes of Antipholus, whoſe ſorrowes were as excéeding as his fathers death was ſodaine, but calling to his remembraunce that againſt death there was neither preſcription, nor authority, who yéeldes no compaſſion to the teares of men, takes no care for their ſighes, ſcornes at their complaintes, and plaieth with their afflictions, Antipholus therefore pacifieng himſelfe for the ſeaſon, beganne to bethinke him of his other affaires, and hauing nowe the lawe in his owne hand, hee cauſed Myletto with Paulina to bee brought both before him: who after hee had moſt louingly imbraced hee comforted them with chearefull and louing ſpéeches, hee likewiſe cauſed them to bee royally robed, in rich and ſumptious apparell be-fitting their eſtate, and bicauſe
Doreſtus ſhoulde dread no bad meaſure, hee ſent a meſſenger vnto him, with the certainty of his fathers death, then making the gats of the city on euery ſide to be ſet wide open in ſigne of peace and amity, accompanieng himſelfe with the king and queene of Hungaria, with ſome fewe noble men to attend their perſons, hee went to Doreſtus, to whome hee ſaid: behold Doreſtus in reſpecte of former frendſhip, lately begunne betweene vs, and to that ende it may be for euer vnfainedly continued, I doe heere freely deliuer vnto thée, Miletto king of Hungaria, with Paulina the queene his wife, the parties which thou haſt ſo much deſired to ſet at liberty, neither would I deliuer them into
 thy handes but that I aſſure my ſelfe of thy princely meaning towardes them, and ſith it hath pleaſed the heauens thus to call away my father, I know not now what ſhould hinder, but that this frendſhip betweene vs ſhould bee ſo ſurelye knit, that no future fortune ſhall euer bee able to diſſolue: It would aske heere another volume, to ſet downe at large, the comfort, the contentment, the quiet, and the ioy that was nowe made amongſt theſe princes, Doreſtus triumphed in hope to haue his deſired Leonida, Miletto reioyced as faſt in the vertuous reconcylyation of his ſonne,
Bruſanus was no leſſe ioyfull for the ſafe deliuery of his father, Antipholus was as much delighted to ſée Bruſanus pleaſed, but after they had a while ſpent the time in this manner, Doreſtus tooke order for the diſſoluing of his army, and cauſing a generall pay to be made, he ſent them away with their captaines and leaders: Miletto likewiſe giuing the Hungarians thankes that had oppoſed themſelues in his reſcues, ſent them alſo away, aſſuring them vppon his returne, both to remember their kindnes, and to recompence their duetifull indeuours: Theſe matters thus ouer paſſed, Doreſtus was at leaſure to conſider of his owne eſtate, which he thought to be more infortunate then the reſt, who hauing ſet all at liberty, and onely himſelfe to remaine a captiue: but it was determined amongſt them that they would all remaine for a ſeaſon with Antipholus: who had likewiſe prepared to entertain them with as great honour as the time woulde afford him, yet tempering his mirth with ſuch meane as was neceſſary for the inſtant, conſidering the late deceaſe of his father that was yet vnburied, beeing not throughly prouided for his funeralls:
Doreſtus in this meane ſpace, taking aduauntage of time, ſo ſolicited Leonida a freſh, that ſhe calling to her minde the high ſeruice hee had performed in her behalfe, in requitall wheerof, ſhe ſurrendered herſelfe to ſatisfie his demandes, to the great contentment of her father and mother, but eſpecially of her deareſt brother Bruſanus: The mariage
 day was quickly determined, and likewiſe honoured with the preſence of all theſe princes, heere began againe feaſting and banqueting afreſh▪ ſtill enterlarding their diſhes with ſuch pleaſures as could moſt aptly be prepared for the preſent: hauing thus for a ſeaſon, ſpent the time aſmuch to their owne contentment as might bee, and after they had combined a perpetuall league of frendſhip betweene themſelues, they departed, Myletto and his queene to Hungaria, Doreſtus and Leonida to Epirus, Bruſanus and Moderna to Dalmatia, which was her inhiritaunce, Antipholus and
Valeria, continue in Illeria, and they ſeuerally raigned, in perfect loue and amity betweene themſelues, gouerning their people with ſuch equity and iuſtice, as they neither wanted loue to their ſubiectes, nor their ſubiectes duety and obedience to them: all parties thus pleaſed, and euery one remaining in moſt happy contentment, I hold it beſt euen ſo to leaue them, for in a fitter time, it is not poſſible to end.
