For she was chaced and expulsed from the company and habytacion of the foresayde kynge her husbande by a false and a coursed olde woman replete with malyce. The whiche old woman for the fyrst nyght founde maner and facion to put a doughter others in the place of the good Quene Berthe.

And the foresayd lady, was full long in exyle, leading her lyfe in teares and lamentacions. But afterwarde. God of his inestimable grace, deliuered the good lady from aduersitie, for at the requeste and instaunce of dyuerse great lordes the lady was accorded vnto her husbande king Pepyn, the whiche in great pyte and honour receyued her.

               It is true that the noble kynge Pepyn had a syster named Bellyssant fayre plesaunte and

                  ight gracious. And in euery thyng well thought and endoctryned. And

the kynge Pepyn her brother loued her wyth perfyte loue. And in so muche that it happened for the reowne that she had, and bycause that bothe great and small loued her for her beaute and humylitie, the kynge Alexander Emperour of Constantynoble was enbraced wyth her loue right ardantly. So it was not longe after that he came into Fraunce for the same cause in right great estate, accompanyed wyth diuers erles and barons the whyche were all in greate pompes and rychesses. So shortly after his arryuayle he assēbled all hys great lordes, and cōmaunded them to aray them in theyr best araye, and that they should go vnto the kynge Pepyn, for to knowe yf he wolde gyue him his excellent sister Bellyssane in maryage. And so they wente forthe and spake vnto kyng Pepyn. Also sone as king Pepin vnderstode theyr message, he graunted them theyr request ryght Joyously. whā this was knowen euidently, they made Joy on euery syde for the good alyaunce of the Emperoure Alexander and of kynge Pepyn, and was receyued wyth all the tryumphe that might be. The spousaylles was made in greate bobaunce and honoure. It is not to be asked yf there was largesse on euerye syde of all maner of thynges. The feest endured longe, and than the Emperoure and hys men toke leue of kynge Pepyn hys brother in lawe for to goe vnto Constantynoble wyth hys Empresse Bellyssant. The kynge made for to araye his men for to accompanye the Emperoure and hys noble syster Bellyssant. And so they mounted all on horsebacke wyth a great sorte of Ladyes for to conuaye Bellyssant. They the whyche abode behynde, wepte tenderly for the departynge of the gracyous lady Bellyssant. The kynge conuayed them diuers Jorneys

And ther he toke leue of kyng Pepyn in rendryng hym mo thankes that I can recounte for the noble there that he had made hym. But amonge all other thynges he thanked hym for his syster. Bellassant the whiche he had gyuen hym to wyfe with so fre a wyll. At these wordes kyng Pepyn embraced hym saying thus. Fayre syr and ryght cordiall lorde and brother to the regarde of my puyssaū

And as for me I am he that with my puysaunce would put both body & goodes in auenture for to serue you and socoure you in all places after my power. And after kyng Pepyn wente towarde his syster Bellyssant, and sayde vnto her. Fayre syster thynke vpon the place that ye be extraught of and guyde you in suche maner that I and your frendes, and all the bloude ryall may haue Ioye profyte and honoure of you.

And the Emperoure mounted on the sea, and had wynde at wyll. And had the tyme so muche at his pleasure, that within shorte tyme he and his men arryued at Constantynoble, where as they were receyued with great tryumphe and honoure, the whiche shoulde he to longe to recounte.

After these wordes yc lady kneled vpō her knees before the Emperour and spake thus vnto him ryght piteously weping. ¶ Alas my lorde haue pytt on me, for I neuer thought vyllany against your persone, & if that ye will not haue pyte on me, at the least haue cō

Alas syr I supplye you and requyre you that ye make me be put in to a toure, & there to be kept streightly vnto my childing. And after that I am deliuered, do with my body what soeuer you will. Thus and in semblable maner the good lady complayned her wepyng and syghyng full profoundly with a sorowfull harte, and they had theyr hartes ryght harde that could abstaine them from wepyng. But the Emperoure that was deceiued by the false Archebysshop, would haue no compassion on his

Ha Blandymayn my frende it shoulde be to me to shameful and dyshonest for to go in suche manet without other deliberacyon.

Whan he sawe her his harte trembled for sorowe for this that he dutst not put her to death, because of her brother kīg Pepyn, and his puissaunce. With rude wordes he said to her. False & cursed woman by the is myne honoure vyturped.

               WHen the Archebisshop sawe that the lady was departed, he thought in himselfe that he wold go after her, and that with her he woulde do his pleasure. He lefte rochet and other vesture, and as irreguler and appostate, gyrde his swerde about hym, and mounted vpon a swifte courser and folowed fost after for he had one of the beste coursers of all Constantynoble. He tode so faste that within short tyme he had tyden a great waye. And of all them that he mette▪ he asked tydynges of the noble lady Bellyssant. And they shewed vnto him the waye that she helde. So longe rode the false traytour Archebysshoppe that he entred in

He had not ryden longe whan he apperceiued the lady with Blandimayn the whiche were beside the fountaine whereas the lady was descended for to refresshe her, and rest her for she was wery and heuy ful of sorowe and doloure, so that she myght not susteyne her. Whiles that Blandymayn cōforted the sorowfull lady, the Archebisshop drewe nere them and knowe the fayre Bellyssant, but she knewe him not a ferre bycause that he was dysgysed, but whan he approched she knewe him well ynoughe.

Lady sayd Blandymayn, haue of hym neyther fere nor doubte. For yf he come for to do you euyl or displeasure I shal put my body for to defende yours vnto the death. At these wordes was arriued the archebisshop that light of his hors, and salued the lady in the best maner that he might and sayd. Ryght dere and honoured lady, it so be that the Emperour hath dechared you, yf you wyll accepte me for to be your loue, and accomplysshe my desyre, I shal do so muche towarde the Emperour that he shal put you in your fyrst estate, and be exalted more hygher then euer you were, wherfore auyse you, for I do it for your great honour and prouffyte. Ha sayd the lady, dysloyall and cruel aduersary of all honoure imperiall, I ought well to haue cause to loue the, and holde the dere, whā that by thy false malyce thou haste made the Emperour vnderstande that I haue myserably borne me towarde hys maiesty and made me be detect from all honoure and prosperyte.

Thou hast put mein the way of extremite and misery, and is the causer that I shall finishe my dates in dolorous distresse, for there is not a more discomforted lady in the worlde then I am. Lady leue suche woordes, for by me ther cā nothing cō to you but good. For I am puissaunt ynough for to chaunge your doloure and discomforte in to Joye & solace, more then euer you had. In saying these wordes he enclyned hym towarde the lady, and wende to haue kyssedher. But Blandimayn sterte betwene them, and gaue the Archebysshoppe so great a stroke that he folled hym vnto the earthe, and braket wayne of his teeth. The Archebysshoppe gate him vp & drew his sworde quicklye. And Blandimain toke a glayue that he had brought with him, and assayled hym ryght asprely and the Archebysshoppe hym. They fought so long that they were booth sore wounded, and as they were thus fyghtyng, there arryued on them a notable marchaunt, that ascryed vnto them also ferre as he myghth se them saying. Lordes lordes leue your debate, and tell me from whence it procedeth, and I shall tell you who hath ryght or wronge. Syr sayd Blandimain, let vs fynyshe our enterpryse.

Syr leue your enterpryse, & touche not the lady, for and the Emperoure knowe of this dede he would make you dye an euill death before all the worlde. Also soone as the Archebysshop vnderstode the marchaunt speake, he left the batrayl quickly

And the Archebysshop made him beleue so many false wordes, that if the lordes of his court had not bene, the whiche fered your futoure, he wold haue made her he btence in a fyre afore all the worlde. Blandymayn said the kynge Pepyn the whiche was tryst and sorowfull, Of as muche holde I the Emperoure more folysher, because he made not my syster dye, for by the God almighty, if I had her hate at this present time, I should

At these wordes he torned the bridle of his horse for to retorne, making great sorowe in his courage, and beganne to saye vnto himselfe. Ha veray God almighty (sayd he) howe often is man deceiued by woman. Nowe am I come to the clene contrary of mine entencion, for I purpensed to haue had once of my syster Bellyssant in my lyfe Ioye and pleasure. And to haue had the Emperoure Alexander for my frende, to succoure me in all my necessities. And by her I am greatly diffamed, and put vnto a great dishonour.

And sayde, by God madame I haue greate feare that ye shall not be welcome to the kynge your brother For also soone as he knewe that the Emperoure had expulsed you from him, he shewed the semblaunt that he was muche angry against you, as he the whiche wil beleue lightly that the faute is in you. Ha God sayde the lady. Now is come vnto me the thing that I moste doubted, at this houre maye I well saye that I from al sydes haue aduersities. For I am expulsed frō my lord and husbande the Emperoure, without ryght or reason. Neuer shall I retourne vnto Paris, but will go into a straunge countrey, so farre that neuer man nor woman shall haue knowledge of my faute, nor know where I am. If my brother the king Pepyn helde me, he would make me dye. Now it is better for to sechewe his ire and

By my fayht sayde the Emperoure, in this quarell is none excutacion, but behoueth you to fyght with the marchaunt that accuse you of treason, & it that ye wil not do it.

excusing him, but litle auayled his speche and his excu sacions, for the Emperoure commaunded that the Ar chebysshop should be kept in suche wyse, that he might haue him at his pleasure euery tyme that he shold aske for hym. And commaunded also that the marchaunt should be taken and honestly treated. Then the Empe roure assembled his counsayll, and the daye was determined, the fielde taken, & the tyltes made, for the marchaunt and the Archebisshop to fyght in. In the which battayll God that is ryghtfull Judge, shewed before euery body that treason and falshode retourned euer to their maisters, as you shall here.

And that he might se and knowe clerely that by euill treason he had separed his wife out of his company, or that by good ryght and good quarell he had expulsed her. To this counsayll he accorded, and sent wt all diligence diuers messengers to Rome, to whome he gaue letters to bere to kynge Pepyn, that was at yt tyme in Rome, defendyng our holy faith againste the infideles, as I haue tolde you before.

Nowe it is so that the daye that they shall fyght together is determined, where as I may know for a certaynte whether my syster Bellyssant is culpa ble of the cryme that is put vpon her or not. And if it be so that the Emperoure hath vniustly done het this dyshonour. I sweare you by myne othe ryall that I shal take vengeaunce on him. For the great offence that he hathe committed, can neuer be recompensed. Then cōmaunded the king Pepyn that all they of his courte were ready for to accompany him vnto Constanty noble, for he wold be there at ye day of the enterprise made betwene the marchaunt and the Archebysshop, so they made all thinges ready as the kyng had cōmaunded. Pepin departed from Rome with a muche fayre company, & so long hath he ryden yt he is come to the sea, & mounted into the galees, and haue done so muche that they are aryued at Constantinoble. And when the Em perour knew the coming of kyng Pepyn, he commaū ded to tynge al the belles of the cytie, & that they shuld make Joye through the cytie. Euery body was glad of the commyng of kyng Pepyn. Themperoure lyght on

But also soone as he sawe the kinge Pepyn he remembred Bellyssant and began to wepe and to syghe so pyteously, that he coud speke neuer a word but wepe, and make great lamentacions wyth heart & mouthe to anguysshously. The kynge Pepyn that had the courage fyerse and proude, cared not for his wepinge. He made semblaunt that he had no pyte nor compassion on him for al his weping, but said vnto him in this maner. Emperour leue your wepynge, and discomforce you not soo muche yf that you haue lost my syster Bellyssāt. For who that leseth a harlot ought not to be dismayed. And syth that my syster is suche one, haue no fere of her, thought nor displeasaunce, H

And yt with wronge and agaynst right I haue expulsed her frome me. By my fayth sayde the kynge Pepyn, of as muche more ought you to be blamed and euery body may know the greate sapience that remayneth in you. Whan that by one euyl exhortacyon you haue so diligently banisshed my syster from you as a comyn harlot, with so greate shame. And knowe that I am lytle beholden vnto him that hath done suche shame & dishonoure vnto my persone, and to all the bloud ryall of Fraunce. Whan the Emperour Alexander heard & vnderstode the wordes, and courage of kynge Pepyn, he was much sorowful in his herte and answered symply vnto the kyng Pepyn agayne, and sayd. Alas syr kinge Pepyn doo not moue your selfe in Ire, but molify a lytle youre courage, for by the pleasure of god almighty ye trouth shal

Nowe is my sister Bellyssant gone in exyle poorely arayed I wote not whether, wherfore my heart ought well to be sory, whā yt for you I must lese her, for I am right certaine that I shal neuer se her. Alas one should be wel ware co giue so hastely Iugement, for one may do an euil thinge, wherby he may repent him all at leyser, and you know wel that renowne is dere, For whā it is lost be it by right or by wronge, it is late recoueringe of it. Lyttel haue you preysed the honoure of my persone, whan that without ony deliberacion, or consideracion that dyuers suche thinges haue be fallen, and dothe by enuy (that ye haue exyled my syster) In saynge these wordes, the Emperour and kinge Pepyn entred into Constantinoble with muche great honour. And whan they were within the cytie the Emperoure wold haue made kinge Pepyn and his mē lodge within his palays muche honourably. But kinge Pepyn wolde not entre, but made lodge his men rounde about him in the cyte. And wolde not receiue of them pe

And when the king saw him in suche distresse, and perill, he began for to wepe muche piteously in saying to hymselfe. Alas alas marchaunt now se I wel euidently that thy dayes bene finyshed for this worlde. Alas nowe maye I know manifestly and for certaine that my sister is culpable of ye deade that she had bene charged with.

Many profounde syghes made the good king Pepin. And the Archebisshop with all his puissaūce might not make his horse approche the marchaunt, the whiche semed wel to be a thing miraculous.

Than spake Ualentine & sayd. Syr Admyrall it is true and certayne that by fals and dysloyall enuye I haue bene accused to the kynge Pepyn and they haue told him that for the great fere and dred

And one morowe he made me to be taken for to smyte of my heed. whan I sawe my selfe in thys daunger, for to length my lyfe I dyd auaunt me before them all of a great folye. For I swore before them of the court that I shoulde come towarde you, for to defye you and all your ba

                  ons on kynge Pepyns behalfe. And more ouer I dyd vaunte me that at my departyng I shuld demaunde you three strokes with a spere vpon your bodi that is so valiaūt and so well renowmed, for to wyn pryse and honoure wherfore I requyre you that ye accorde me this thynge, for otherwyse I dare not retourne before the kynge Pepyn, lest he make me dye. Sone sayde the Admyral

by mahommet the ryght puyssaunt, you shall not be refused, but at this same houre I vttre to you ye Justes. And to the ende that ye frensshmen that hathe assyeged this cyte may se your hardynes, I shall make the Justynge place to be made▪ redy and ordeyned without the cyte. Gramercy than sayd Ualentyne, that fell downe for to kysse the fete of the Admyrall, in token of humylyte and obeysaunce. But it is sayd in a comyn prouerbe, that they do the shoo often of, whom of they wolde cut of the foote. Ualentyne was renowmed in the courte of the Admyrall, & euer he requyred god that he wolde do hym soo moche that he myght knowe and wytte from when she was comen, and who was his fader & his moder. And as he was in that grete thought, ye admyrall sayd vnto hym. Fayre sone me thynke you are ryght heuy and thoughfull. It is true syr sayd Ualentyne, and not without a cause. For I haue to grete fere that I shall be slayne by you in the Justes. Wherfore I praye you humbly that it wyll please you to make me haue a preest that maye gyue me absolucyon of my synnes. Than the Admyrall cōmaunded that they shol de fetche hym a preest. ¶ And whan he was comen, he gaue hym vnto Ualentyne in sayenge to him. Now haue & confesse you of all your confessyons, I wolde not gyue you a button. Ualentyne toke ye preest and drewe hym asyde. And whan they were togyder Ualentyne sayd vnto hym. Alas syr you are a crysten preest, and ought amongest all other to haue wyll and courage to kepe and defende our holy fayth, wherfore herken and vnderstande that I shall tell you I praye you with all my herte, for it is a thynge the whiche is ryght chargea ble. It is true that I muste fyght todaye with the false

Admyrall that is so grete an enmye to our fayth. Now knowe I well that sarasyns and paynyms wyll yssue out of the cyte for to se ye Justynge that is determyned without the walles of the cyte. Wherfore I shall tell you what in shall do, you shall aduertyse the crysten men that is in the cyte that none of them yssue out: but kepe them in harneys without ony noyse. And whan yt paynyms shall be without the cyte they shal take ye gardes of the gates, in suche maner that whan ye sarazins wolde entre in to the cyte, that you shytte the gates agaynste them. And bydde the crysten men sende kynge Pepyn worde of this fayte, and that he kepe his men in armes, to the ende that whan it shall be tyme that he come rennynge vpon the sarazyns, and they of the cyte shall assayll them on the other syde. And by this meane they shall be slayne and vaynquysshed to daye. And whan Ualentyne had tolde this to the preest he confessed hym, and after his confessyon the preest departed, and wente his waye, and cōmaunded him to god. Than the Admyral made Ualentyne to be ledde in to his chā

                  yd as his persone Ualentyne was set at the table with dyuers other barons. Moche coude he behaue him honestly before them all. whan the dyuer was done the Admyrall called to hym a neuewe of his, that was called Salatas. And cō maunded hym for to arme Ualentyne also well as his propre persone. And dyd charge his sayd neue we that he sholde delyuer vnto Ualentyne ye best hors yt myght befounde in all his courte. And whan ye Admyrall had spoken so to his newe, he entred in to the halle prepared, and there he was armed by paynyms experte in armes.

And Salatas toke valentyne and ledde hym in to afayre halle, and than he made to be brought before him muche harneis, and with the beste that hee coulde fynde he made valentyne bee armed as the Admyrall his vncle had commaunded him. And whan he was armed he lepte vpon a myghtye steade, and the Admyrall yssued out of his place mounted, and in armes ryghte triumphantly. Than they rode bothe two toward the chefe gate of Rome. For on that side Kinge Pepyn had layde the siege. And whan they were in the fielde valen tine toke his shielde and hanged it about his necke, in the whiche was a harte ongled and dented wyth sable, in a felde of s

whan the paynyms sawe theyr Admyrall deed, and dyscomfyte, they ranne vpon Ualentyne for to haue put hym to dethe. But valentyne with a hardy courage, smote his hors with the sporres, and with his swerde of armes he dyd so grete dedys of armes that he passed the paynyms, and slewe and wounded manye. Than came kynge Pepyn and his hoost and entred in to the batayll, the whiche was so asprely assayled of the sarasyns, that he was smyten downe to the grounde. But valentyne came theder the whiche socoured him so that he horsed hym agayne. And whan he was mounted he sayd vnto valentyne. Chylde you haue saued my lyfe, but and it please god it shall be rewarded the. At that tyme rose a grete crye on bothe partyes, and ye batayll was so fyerse and stronge that the paynyms were constrayned to recule abacke. The crysten men that were in the cyte yssued out vpon them the whiche had planted the standardes and baners of kynge Pepyn vpon the walles, wherof the paynyms were sore abasshed, & meruaylled. They were assayled also well of ye kynges hoost, as of them of yt cyte, so that shamefully and myserably they fynysshed theyr dayes. In that batayll remayned deed vpon the felde ten thousande paynyms, and all throughe ye enterpryse and valyauntnes of valentyn, the whiche bare hym so rygorously that day the he slewe foure horses vnder hym. And thus throughe his prowesse ye cyte was wonne agayn. For the whiche there was made grete Joye & myrth throughe all crystendom & pryncypally in ye cyte of rome, & in those partyes nere it, euery body cryed mountioye to the kyng Pepyn of Fraunce. He was praysed so of euery body, yt by the consente of the people he was sacred by the pope

Empeorure crowned. Moche well he gouerned & augmented the chyrche in his tyme. He dyde egall Justyce vnto euery body, soo that all folkes sayd good of hym. ¶ In this tyme was pope Clement the fourth of that name, that consacred kynge Pepyn Emperoure.

                  AFter that the kynge Pepyn by the grace of god, and by the strengthe of armes had chaced the infideles and enemyes of our fayth out of the partyes Romayns, he came vnto Orleaunce, and there he founde the quene Berthe hys wyfe that receyued hym wich all the Joye and tryumphe that myght be made, with her lytell sone Charlemayne, and her excellent doughter Eglantyne. The

whiche was ryght gladde and Joyous / bicause that Ualentyne was comen agayne safe and sounde, So she sotourned not longe but that shee sente for hym and he came with a good wyll. Than whan the lady sa we hym, she salued hym amyably saynge. Ualentyne my loue ye be hertely welcome well ought you to be de rely kepte and honoured, for it is sayd that aboue all other ye haue wonne vyctorye and triumphe vpon the paynyms that helde Rome in theyr subiectyon.

And more ouer the kynge your fader hathe done me soo moche good and honoure, that in my lyfe I can not deserue to what seruyce someuer I do hym. And in sayenge these wordes Haufray and henry esprysed with enuye dyde entre in to the chambre of Eglantyne. And whan Haufray and Henry were entred they sayd vnto hym. Ualētyne what come you here to do in the chambre of our syster that apperteyneth not to you, to moche ye shewe yourselfe folysshe and hardy for to entre in to her chambre ryall, for you are but a begyler, and none can know what you are, nor from whens ye becomen. Wherfore beware that ye be not founden no more with her, leste that euyll come to you. Ualentyne sayd vnto Haufray, of your syster haue no doubte, for syth that I was borne I neuer thought towarde her thynge, saue all good and honoure. Yf that I be poore, and that they knowe not what I am, yet wolde I not do nor thynke thynge that sholde be agaynst the maiestery all. And to the ende that you haue no doubte that your syster Eglātyne shall haue by me ony blame, at this same houre I promyse

you that I shall neuer enter in to her chambre agayne. At these wordes departed Ualentine out of the chambre, and Eglantyne abode wepyng al alone moche tenderly. Ualentyne moūted into the palays for to serue the kinge which was set al redy. Ther was haufray and Henry, and the duke Millon dangler that serued the kyng at table wyth Ualentyne. And whan he was rysen he called Ualentyne, and sayd heryng them all. Lordes here is Ualentyne that hathe well and truely serued me, and socoured in my necessitees, to the ende that eche of you may knowe it and for the good seruices that he hathe done me, in abydynge tyl better come I gyue hym the Erldom of Clermont in

To heare suche wordes were Haufraye and Henrye to sorowfull wherefore eche sayde to other. Thys same foundelynge which god course is in the grace of the kyng, so that yf we fynde not remedy / he shall be unes cause of our gret dommage. For the kynge hath no chyldren but vs, and the lytell Charlemayne, of whome we may do our wil after the death of our father, but it is of certayntye that Ualentyne wyll supporte him and holde hym agaynste vs. Wherfore we must fynde the manner to put hym in the indignacion of the king, and to purchase his deathe for otherwyse we can not auenge vs. And than maye we at oure owne pleasure gouernethe realme wythout contradyecyon. Than spake Haufray and said, Broder Henry I haue found the maner whereby the false boye shall be deceyued and betrayed.

The complayntes came vnto ye kyng euery day from one all partes. So it, happened daye that a poore man came vnto the kynge all wounded and blody, and sayd to hym.

So they aduysed amonge them that the kynge sholde make erye al aboute, that who myght take ye wylde man quycke or deed, he sholde haue a. M. marke of fyne golde. So the counsayl was holden and the crye publysshed. And theder came many knyghtes

of all estates for to take Orson and the pryse conquere Than the kynge Pepyn beynge in his palays wyth diuers great lordes and noble barons that of thys mater spake and made great admeracions among them selfe. Amonge the whych lordes and barons Haufraye that was mortall enemye of Ualentine began for to saye thus. Syrhere is Ualetyne that you haue nourysshed and put in great honoure, whiche hathe required oure syster Eglantine of loue dysordinate, and of great dishonoure. And because that I am well informed of this case, for to se what he can do, and for to she we his valyauntnes, let him go seke the wild man that is so dread and you shall gyue hym Eglantyne, so shal hys wyl be accomplysshed on all sydes. Haufray sayd the kynge thy speche is not gracyous, but is ful of enuy. For yf so be that Ualentine be poore / and of lowe bitthe, and that I haue founde him in the foreste, I finde him so good / humble and debonaire, that he seameth more gentiller, and of nobler courage than thou arte. Leaue thy spekynge of him / for the good matters and condicions that is in him / proueth and sheweth that he is extracte out of a good place, and of a noble lignage.

without a cause ye haue spoken of me, and yet I neuer dydde you amysse. You wyll that I go for to fyght with the wylde man, to ye ende that I dye, and that ye maye be venged on me▪ but I make auowe to god that I shall neuer reste in no place tyll that I haue founde the wylde man. And whan yt I shall haue founde him I shall fyght with him in suche maner that quicke or deed I shall bringe him hither before you all, or I shall finisshe my dates. And yf it happen that god gyue me the strengthe for to conquere him, there shall ueuer none se me in this countre till that I haue founde the fader that engendred me, to the ende that I maye knowe yf I am bastarde or legitime, and wherfore I was lefte in the wodde. Whan the kynge vnderstode the enterpryse of Ualentine he was moche displeasaunt, for he fered more to lese him than ony of the other of his courte. And curseth Haufray and Henry that made him enterpry so that thinge. And after called Ualentine and said. My childe auise you what you wyll do, for to fighte with the wildeman, it semeth me a thinge vnpossyble to you. You knowe well ynoughe that by hym is deed many valyaunt men, and that some noble champyons hathe lefte this enterpryse. And therfore be not so dysmaybe that for the speche of them twayne you lese your lyfe, for it is to cruell a thinge to abyde suche a beest that is without naturall vnderstandyng. For god my childe suffre and endure the wordes of ye enuyous for it is a fayre vertue to them that can endure false tō

place. I take leue of you and commaunde you to good, For to morowe in the mornynge I thynke to take my waye for to acheue myn enterpryse. At these wordes de parted the valyaunt knyght Ualentyne, and toke his leue of kynge Pepyn. Upon the morowe he herde masse and after mounted on horsbacke for to go seke the wylde man. ¶ Now it is not to be demaunded yf the fayre Eglantyne made grete sorowe and lainentacons all yt nyght. And whan that it was daye she called to her a damoy sell that was secrete & sayd vnto her. My frende goo towarde valentyne and tell hym that I sende hym worde that he come & speke with me or he departe, and that he haue no boubte of non lyuynge to entre in to my chambre. For aboue all thynges I desyre to se hym, and it is my synguler wyll that he take leue of me or he departe. Than wente the damoysell towarde Ualentyne that was on horsbacke, and dyde vnto him her message as Eglantyne had charged her. Whan Ualentyne vnderstode the message he sayd vnto her. My damoy sell I knowe that the loue that is bitwene my lady Eglantyne and me, is lay al and of good equyte, and yet I knowe so moche by her that she wolde not thynke the thyng that myght torne her to dyshonoure. And so god helpe me as for me I wolde her no harme, but all honoure & worshyp. But enuye is of suche nature yt it hathe neuer reste. And sooner ben the enuyous of theyr nature enclyneo to saye euyl of good folkes than good, And euer ymagyneth false invencyons agaynst them that wolde wynne honoure. Now it happeneth me in this maner, for I knowe for certaynte that Haufray, and Henry

he dylcended of his hors and tyed hym vnto a tree, and than he toke brede and wyne that he had brought with hym, and a lytell refresshed hym. ¶ And whan that he had eten and that the night was comen, and the daye all faylled, than Ualentine for fere of the nyght mounted vpon a tree, and there abode. And whan it was daye he loked aboute hym, and sawe his broder Or sō that ranne throughe the forest as a wylde beest, the whiche auysed the hors of Ualentine, and drewe towarde hym And whan he sawe hym so fayre and so pleasaunt, he combed hym a paas we

                  h his roughe handes, in makynge him chere. For he had neuer sene so fayre a beest whan Ualentines hors felte and apperceyued the wylde man that scratched hym on all sydes, he began for to stryke and flynge incontinent myghtely. And Ualentyne that was vpon the tree behelde the maners of the wyldeman, that was ryght horryble for to beholde, & moche to doubte. Than he reclaymed our lorde and the gloryous vrgin Mary ryght deuoutly, in praienge and requiringe him with herte and minde that he wolde preserue him from the wylde man, and gyue him victorie agaynst him. Orson torned so moche aboute the hors of Ualentine, that the hors that was fyerge began for to smyte and byte him. And whan Orson apperceiued that he enbraced the hors for to caste him downe, and fyght with him. Whan the noble Ualentyne sawe that the wylde man woldesse his hors, he cryed on hye and sayd. Wylde man leue my hors and a byde, for with me thou shalte haue batayll. Than Orson the wylde man lefte the hors of Ualentine, and lifte vp his eyen and loked vp in to the tree. And whan he sawe Ualentine he made hym sygnes with his handes and heed the

he would pull him in peces. And then valentine made the sygne of the crosse in recōmaunding him vnto god and after drewe out his sworde and lepte downe besyde Orson. When Orson sawe the sworde that valentyn woulde haue smyt

And then he came to valentyne and with cleane strengthe threwe hym to the earthe vnder hym, wherof valentyne was sore abashed and discomforced for he wende well to haue dyed and fynyshed his dayes in that place. For he felte Orson the sauage so strōg that he had neuer hope for to escape fro hym. Ha very God sayde he haue pytie on me, and suffre not that I fynyshe here my dayes thus pyteously by this wylde man. Diuers times valētyne wende for to haue turned Orson vnder hym, but he ne might. When valentyne sa we that by strengthe of bodye he myght not wynne hym, he drewe out a sharpe poynted knyfe and smote Orson in to the ryght syde, in suche wyse that the bloude yssued out by great haboundaūce.

And there they fought so longe together that it were to muche for to recount al the maner. As they fought thus without cesyng. Orson tooke his shelde fro about his necke. And when that he had taken it from hym, he behelde it tyght strongly, because of the beautie of the colours that he was not accustomed for to se, and then he cast it strongly against the earth, and incontinent retourned vnto valentyne, and

with his nayles and his teeth pressed hym so harde yt he broke both harneys and haubergon. And smote him so tudely with his nailes that he made the bloud sprōg out on all sydes. And when Ualentyne felte hymselfe so sore wounded, he was tyght sorowfull and pensife & began for to reclayme our sord with both his harte and courage. Alas said he veray god almighty in ye is mine only hope and truste, mine onely refuge and comforte, wherfore I praye the humbly that thou wilt haue pytte on me.

                  lamong the lyons, so kepe me from this wylde man. And when Ualentine had made his prayer vnto god, he went towarde Orson with his sworde for to haue smyten him, but Orson lepte a back and went to alyttell tree, the whiche tree he bowed and bracke it, and made therof an horryble staffe, and after came vnto Ualentyne and gaue hym suche a strooke yt he made hym for to fall vpon one knee. Ualentyne as hardy rose vp quickely, and so began betwene them a ryght fyerse batayll. And the two brethren had ardaūe desyres for to destroye eche other, but they knewe not yt they were brethren, nor the cause of their fortune. Orson was so cruel & so strong yt he would haue staine Ualentyne dyuers tymes if it had not bene for his sworde that he doubted aboue all thinges, because of ye knyfe that he had smyten him with. So muche and so longe they fought together by dyuers maners that they were both wery and strongly trauayled. Then Ualentyne behelde Orson and began for to saye vnto hym. Alas wylde man, wherfore doest thou not yelde the vnto me thou lyuest here in this woddelyke a beaste, and hathe no knowledge of God, nor of his blyssed mother saynt

Mary, nor of his holy fayth, for the whiche thy soule is in great daunger. Come on thy way with me & then shalt thou do wysely. I shall make the be baptized, and shall teache the, the holy fayth. And shall geue the flesh and fylthe, bread and wyne ynough for to eate, and clothes and all maner of thinges that appertayneth vnto a mannes body, and shalt vse thy lyfe honestly as euery naturall body should doo. When Orson vnderstode Ualentyne speke, he apperceyued well by his sygnes yt he would him good. And Ualentyne spake vnto hym of God and of ourlady, and then after the course of nature that can not lye, Orson fell downe vpon both his knees, & stretcheth forth his handes towarde his brother Ualentyne, in makyng hym signe that he woulde forgeue hym, and that he woulde obeye vnto hym in al maner of thynges for the tyme to come. And he shewed vnto him by sygnes that neuer the dayes of his life he should fayle him, neyther with body nor goodes. It is not for to be demaunded if that Ualentyne was glad when he sawe that the wilde man was conquered by hym and put in subiection, and made greate ioye and not without a cause. For he had cōquered more honour by his prowisse then any knight that was in his time, for there was none that durste vndertake it were he neuer so bolde nor hardy. He toke Orson by the hande, & shewed him by sygnes that he should go afore hym tyll they were out of the wodde, and so he dyd, and anone they were out of the wodde. Then Ualentyne toke one of his gyrthes, and for doubte that he shoulde doo hym no harme nor none other, he bounde his handes taste vnto his body. And when that he had bounde hym fast he mounted on horsebacke and ledde him with hym as

a beast tyed, without that euer this same Orson didde hym any harme, or made hym an euyl semblaunt, that was a thyng myraculous.

toke a pot & ledde Orson into the seller that was open. And when he had drawen the pot ful of wyne, he gaue it him, and Orson lyft vp the pot and tasted it & found it good. And he dronke so myghtely that he dronke all oute, and after he cast the pot vnto the earth: and made sygne vnto Ualentine that he shold drawe more wyne. And valentyne toke vp the pot & filled it wt good wyne Orson toke it and espied a great bolle & put the wyne therin, and then he bare it vnto Ualentynes horse for to drynke. And when Ualentyne sawe that, he made hym sygne that he dronke but water, and Orson shewed hym by sygnes that the wyne was better then the water. Dyuers other thynges dyd Orson in the house the whiche shoulde be longe to recounte. The nyght was come, and it was tyme to go to bedde. So Ualentyne souped and made Orson soupe with hym the whiche spared not the wyne, for he toke so muche yt he was dronke. Than he layde hym do w

Nowe se I this wylde man, in whome nowe neither force nor strēgth, and myght be slayne or euer he awaked. And when he had sayde this, for to proue more the hardines of Orson▪ he put hym so harde with his fote that he awaked hym, and then he made hym sygne that there was folkes about the house. Then Orson arose as all afrayde and toke a great logge that stoode in the chymney, and ranne agaynst the gate so myghtely that he made al to shake. And valentyne began for to laugh ryght strongly, wherby Orson knewe that he did it for to assaye him

So he made hym sygne that he shuld take his reste, & that he shoulde haue noo feare of nothing, for he wold kepe him well. Than Orson layd hym downe by the fyre and his logge in his armes. And Ualentine was all the nyghte besyde him, the whiche dyd watche hym with out slepynge for fere that he shuld be assailled, for the noyse was so great that euery body left his house, and withdrew them into the chyrch. And al the nyght without any reast ronge the belles for to assemble the people, that in a great nombre alarmed made the watche for fere of the wyld mā. And thus passed the night tyll that it was lyghte daye. And whan it was daye lyght Valentyne mounted on horsbacke, and bounde Orson, and put him on the way towarde Orlyaunce And he dyd so muche that vpon a thursday he aryued within the towne.

Whan the quene Berthe and the fayre Eglantyne knew that they were in the palays they went in to theyr chambres for great fere. Valentyne mounted vp and entred into the halle where as kynge Pepyn was wyth all the barons and knightes of his court, & Haufray & Henry that wyth semblaunt shewed great sygnes of loue to Valentyne. And him semed that they were ryght Ioyous of his vyctory and prowesse. But they were neuer so syrowfull in theyr hertes, for they wende neuer that he should haue retorned on liue and cursed Orson because he had not slayne hi. The kinge Pepyn and all they of hys court behelde Orson gladly. And the kyng sayd. Lordes by god almighty it is a metuayllous thinge to se this wylde man, he is tight well made and of a fayre stature. And how wel that he is roughe, yf he were clothed as we be, he wolde seme

Syr I requyre you that he may be baptyzed, and than he shall be taught the lawe of Ihesu cryste, for that is my desyre, and soo I haue promysed him. It pleaseth me wel sayd the kynge, and I wyll that it it be done so. Than he cōmaunded a prest that he sholde baptyzed hym. And these were his god

And other name they gaue hi not saue that whiche he had taken in the forest. Whan Orson was baptyzed kynge Pepyn sat hym downe to dyner, and Ualentyne serued him of the cuppe, for that was his offyce. And whan euery man was set, he comma

Orson aduysed ye meet that was in the platter and toke as moche as he myght catche and bare it awaye, and ete it quickely. And whan he hadde eten it he loked on the other syde and espyed a seruaūt that bare a pecocke in a platter for to serue the kynge. Than Orson ranne towarde him a grete pace and toke it fro hym, and than he satte hym downe vpon the erthe in ye myddes of the halle, and began for to ete it as a famisshed wolfe. Ualentin apperceyued it and shewed him bysygnes that he gouerned hym not wyll, wherof Orson was ashamed, for aboue all thynges he fered and redoudted naturally Ualentyn, & kynge Pepin badde that they sholde lette him alone, for he toke pleasure at hym. Whan he had eten well he toke a pot of wyne & of

                  RYght gladde and Ioyous was the excellente lady Eglantyne that Ualentyne had conquered the wylde man. So she sente hym worde that he sholde brynge the wylde man vnto her. Than Ualentyne called Orson & toke hym by the hande and ledde hym in to the chambre of Eglantyne, in the whiche was dyuers ladyes that gladly behelde Orson. And Orson in laughynge lepte vpon the bedde, & sate there makynge dyuers sygnes that was ryghe pleasaunt vnto ye ladyes. But that the whiche he dyd they vnderstode not, of the whiche they were much displeasaunt. So they called Ualentyn and demaūded hym what it was that the wylde man shewed them by sygnes. And Ualentyne sayd to them. My ladyes knowwe for a trouthe that ye wylde man sheweth you by his sygnes that he wolde gladly kysse and colle the damoy selles that be here, wherat they began for to laughe & to beholde eche other. And thus as they deuysed togyder, and that they played in the chambre of Eglantyne for the comynge of the wylde man, Haufray came towarde Henry and sayd to him. Fayre broder to euyl go the our feate, for you se that this wretched foūdelynge Ualentyne mounteth and encreaseth euery daye more and more in honoure amonge the prynces and ladyes, and among the other thynges the kynge is more louinge vnto hi than vnto eyther of vs two, ye whiche maye adnychyl gretely our honoure. Haufray sayd, Henry ye saye trouthe and speketh wysely. And as for me I fe re not but that we shal haue ones and euil reproche by hym yf he endure longe. Broder sayd Haufray herken What I shall tell you. Ualentyne is now in ye chambre of our syster Eglantyne, the whiche thinge we haue de

fended hym so longe ago, wherfore we haue good occasyon for to take hym and moue stryfe & debate agaynst hym. And therfore yf you wyll byleue me we shal go in to the chambre, & by vs shall be put to dethe. And than we shal make the kynge byleue that we dyd fynde him with our syster doynge his wyll with her. Thus spake the two traytours false and dysloy all. And euen so as ye Iewes by theyr enuye crucyfyed & ymagyned yt dethe of our lorde with wronge and without cause. Euen so dyde Haufray & Henry to Ualentyne that was so swete and so amyable, obeyenge vnto euery body, and out of his mouthe neuer yssued a vylaynous worde. And after that they had accorded theyr vnhappye enterpryse, they wente in to the chambre of the fayre and pleasaūt Eglantyne, And also soone as Haufray was entred, he said vnto Ualentin. Euyll and dysloyall man nowe knowe we that yf thy folye and outragyous volente yu wylte not cefrayne nor absteine the, but in perseuerynge in thy malyce and folysshe oppynyon, purcha synge from daye to daye the dyshonoure of our fader yt kynge Pepyn, by the meane and accorde of our fals and dysloyall syster Eglantyne, of ye whiche you do your pleasure and wyll, euen so as of a woman vnhappy and habandoned, wherfore it is well ryght and reason that euyll come to you. And syth yt the kynge setteth nought therby, it is force that we take vengeaunce on you▪ and in saynge these wordes the traytour. Haufray lyfte vp his hande and smote Ualentyne vpon the vy sage in suche maner, that he made the clere bloode yssue oute of his mouthe haboundauntlye. And than Henry the other traytour approched nere hym, and with a glayue that was bothe sharpe & longe he wende to haue smite

Ualentyne much outragyously. And whan Orson sawe that they wolde outrage valentyne / he lepte forthe & gaue Haufray so grete a stroke with his rough hande that he felled hym vnto the earthe. And after he ran towarde Henrye, and streyned hym so bytwene his armes that yf the ladyes had not ben that appeased hym he had dystroyed hym at that tyme. Than arose the cry in the chambre so great / that the moost parte of the barons came into the chambre. And whan they apperceyned that Orson dealt so euyl with the kings sons / they wolde haue smyten hym with glayues and swerdes, & put them all in defence agaynste hym, for to haue put hym to death. ¶ Than Ualentine for to socour Orsō drewe his swerd. And swore by god almyghty, if ony of them touched Orson with swerd or knyfe, he should be his preest what someuer myght happen therfore. And than he made sygne vnto Orson that he shulde be styll without doynge any outrage. And Haufray & henry went towarde theyr father kinge Pepin sorowfull and heuy, and haufray said vnto him. Ha syr in an euil houre was euer Ualentin borne the which you hold so dere. For he hath broughte the wylde man hether, that hathe almooste dystroyed vs. Syr you shal do tyght euyll yf you let hym lyue any lenger, for dōmage & dishonour he wyl bere you shortly. For god make that he be drowned or hanged, for the garde of him is nought nor his company. Whan the kynge Pepyn vnderstode this tidinges, he was much sorowful. And sayd that he wolde make Orson the sauage to be put in a toure where as he shoulde neuer come out but by licence. So kinge Pepyn sente for Ualentine for to demaūde hym the case. And Ualentine recounted vnto him the enter

pryse as it had ben done by Haufray & Henrye sayinge Syr I was in the chambre of my ladye your doughter Eglantyne, in the company of dyuers ladyes and gentyll women, that desyred strongly, for to se Orson, and pryncypally I had brought hym vnto my lady Eglā
                  tyne. So I can not tel you wherfore nor by what title my lordes your two sones Haufray and Henry dyd entre into the chambre / in sayinge vnto me that I dydde my pleasure with your doughter, and that they knewe it longe agone. And in spekyng vnto me fyerse & proude wordes, Haufraye by an outragious volente smote me vpon my vysage with his hande, and Henrye with his sweard wend for to haue slayne me Orson beynge that my body was in daunger, wente towarde theym and smote them bothe down, so that the bruyte and the noyse arose therfore as you may here. ¶ And is it true sayd the kynge Pepyn so as you tell me. If syr sayd va lentyne vpon the payne of my lyfe, other thynge nor other cause knowe I not. Nowe by god sayd the kynge Pepyn Orson hathe done his deuoyr and that whyche he ought to do. And you Haufray & Henry ful of enuye and cursed malyce / ye be to blame. I se and know clerelye that wythall your puyssaunce ye seke from daye to daye to noye Ualentyne. ye be wel of an euill nature to purchase his euyl whan you se that I loue hym and that he serueth me truelye. I defende you to wyll hym ony hurt, wherefore let hym alone. For I wyll not for goo hym for none other. And I am wel certayne that he wolde neuer thynke nor serch my dyshonoure. Euen so departed Haufray and Henry that were much soroweful and displeasaunt. And Ualentine abode at that houre in the hal with all the other lordes and barons of the

court. And Orson wente thorowe the palays here and there. At the laste he entred in to the kechyn, and sawe the meet that the coke made redy for souper, soo he approched nere hym and toke two capons all rawe and ete them as a dogge. Whan the coke sawe that, he toke a pestel and gaue Orson soo grete a stroke that he made hym for to bowe. Than Orson stouped downe and toke the coke and threwe hym downe in the place, and gaue hym so many strokes that he had almoost slayne hym. The tydynges came vnto kynge Pepyn that orson doewe the coke, and that none durste approche▪ nere hym. Wherat the kynge was angry, and made Orson to be brought before hym, and made hym sygnes that he wolde make hym be hanged. But Orson wente anone and fetched the pestell, and shewed the kynge howe the coke had smyten hym. And whan the kynge vnder stode the case, he pardoned orson entyerly, & cōmaunded that none s

And he taught hym so well that he dyde neuer after euyll nor dyspleasure, but yf yt they began fyrste.

And after he tolde them the wordes of the messenger, and demaunded them counsayll yf that he sholde go towarde Acquytaine for to socoure the good duke Sauary▪ or towarde Lyon to defende his coūtre To ye whiche thynge answered Myllon dangler. Syr vpō this mater you must be counsaylled, for your shyrte is more nerer your body than your gowne, yo

                  sayll and accepted it▪ and after sayd vnto ye messenger of the good duke Sauary, that at that tyme he myght not socoure his mayster, for it behoued hym to lede his hoost toward Lyon. But tell your lorde that he kepe hym wel tyll that I haue done here, & that than I shal

But syth that it can not be none otherwyse I thanke you for your god wyll. And with the leue of your hyghe maieste I wyll departe from you. At these wordes the messenger of the duke Sauary retorned in to Acquytayne and tolde the tydynges and the lettyng of the kynge Pepyn. And whan the duke Sauary vnderstode that he might haue no socoure of ye kynge Pepyn, he was moche sorowful. For ye grene knyght made hym grete warre, & had assyeged hym to nere. And you ought for to knowe that this same grene knyghte was broder vnto Ferragus the gyaunt, that kepte the lady Bellyssant in his castell, the whiche was Ualentines moder, and the wylde Orsons, as you haue herde declared before. ¶ Now is ye duke Sauary within Acquitayne right pensyf and sorowfull for ye grene knyghte that made hym suche warre for his doughter. He made to be cryed and commaunded that all they of his hoost sholde be in harneys as vnto suche a case apperteyned. And that on the morowe in mornynge he wolde yssue out vpō ye grene knyght for to fyght with him Euery body put himselfe in poynt and dyde theyr dylygence for to arme them. And whan the daye was clere the trompettes and clarons dyde so wne, and than the men of armes on euery syde as well on horsbacke as on fote put hem vpon the waye to yssue oute of the cyte Grete haste had the duke Sauary to assayll the grene knyght. But suche weneth to auaunce hymself that oftentymes do the his owne dōmage. And so it happened vnto the duke as you shal here. The duke Sauary

yssued out of Acquytaine with a great company. And whan he was vpon the feld he made to sown his trompettes and clarons as a valyaunt champyon for to assayll his enemyes, and smote in amongest theym. The sarazyns and painims that were in grete nombre, did rynne vnto armes, and than began a meruayllous and a fyerse batayll. And the grene knyght sinote wyth his axe of armes myghtye strokes, for at his fyrste entre he slewe two knyghtes. Than the Duke Sauary drewe to ward hym / and they assaylled ech other ryght fiersely, for the good duke was much valyaunt. But not for that▪ he did to grete a foly when he enterprised to fight with the grene knyght / for the predestynacyon of hym was suche that he shuld neuer be conquered, nor vamquysshed but of a man that shoulde be a kynges sonne and that had neuer bene nourysshed of womanne, nor souked theyr brestes. So he thought that suche a man myght neuer be founden. But such a child is vpon the earth that shal fyght wyth hym and vaynquyssh hym that is Orson the sauage as you shal here afterwarde The duke Sauary and the grene knight fought longe togyder. But the good duke Sauary entred to ferre in for whan he wend to haue withdrawn him to his hoste he was enclosed wyth painyms and sarazyns, that toke hym prysoner and led hym vnto the grene knighte, the whiche was so ryght gladde of hym, that he wolde not haue let him go for no treasure. And the good duke Sauery reclaymed God and the virgin Marye in hys herte. Whan the chrystan men knew that the duke was taken, they retorned into Acquitayne heuy and sorowfull. Than began the people for to make greate dole & sorowe in the cytie of Acquytayne / wepynge bytterlye

for theyr good Duke that they loued so muche. There was his thre sones. Garyn▪ Anseline▪ and Garyn the yō
                  gest, that made grete dole for theyr fader. But aboue al other the sorowe and lamentacions of Fezonne passed the which teared her here that was shining as the golde, and wepte full bytterly with her pleasaunt eyen and sayd. Alas in an euyl houre was I borne, whan that so many noble knyghtes and vassalles must suffre so hydeous deathes, and pyteous lamentacyons for me. And yet there is a thyng in my hert that greueth m

Alas my ryght dere fader to muche haue you loued me, whan that my loue is sold you so derely that you must suffre death therfore. Thus complained Fezonne full soore wepyng, the which had the wil and courage to haue slayne her self, but the ladies letted her And the grene knyght in hys pauyllyon that made the good duke to be brought before him, & sayde vnto hym ryght fyersly. Now seest thou that thou art in my subgeccyon at this tyme and that I haue puysaunce for to saue the or spyll the. I shall tell the what thou shalte do gyue me thy doughter Fezonne vnto wife, and in thys doynge thy lyfe shal be saued, and I shal leade her into thy greane mountayne where as I shal make her to be rychely crowned. Sarazin said the Duke I shal tel the my wyl. Know that thou shalt neuer haue my Doughter if that thou make the not be Baptyzed, and byleue in Jhesu Christ. Sauary sayd the greane knighte neuer speke vnto me of suche a thynge / for neuer the dayes of my life wyl I byleue in thy god. And yet I tel the more

that and thou wil not beleue my counsall I shal make the dye and fynysshe thy dayes vyllaynouslye. And yet I tel the that I shal make Acquitaine to be brente / and to be putte to execucyon. And all menne and womenne and chyldren lytle and great I shall make suffer deathe Paynym sayde the Duke Sauary god of his inestimable grace kepe me from thy furour and great cruelnesse for in hym is all my trust, and in hym is onely my conforte. For longe were they speakyng of this mater, bothe the grene knyght and the Duke Sauary, that in reclaymynge god syghed full tenderlye. And the greane knyght beheld hym. And whan he saw the great lamentacyons that hee made▪ and the pyteous teares that hee wept he sayd vnto him, Free duke, leue thy wepyng, for I am so esprysed with the loue of thy doughter. and so ardauntly enbraced, that for the loue of her I haue no talent nor courage for to put the vnto deth, but am to tally delibered for to let the go vnder this condiciō that thou shalt finde me a knight wythin thys syxe monethes that by strength of armes maye wyn thy doughter agaynst me, and thou do I shall retorne home into my countre agayne wythal myne host, wythout was tynge or destroyinge of the lande. And yf it happen so that I be not conquered & ouer comen within ye sayd terame I shal haue thy Doughter vnto wyfe, and leade her into my countre without makyng ony other warre And the Duke accorded thereto. And than the trewes was cryed for the space of syxe monethes. ¶ After that the crye was made, the grene knyght gaue the duke sauary lycence for to go, and made hym for to swere that he shuld hold the sayde couenaunt truely. Thus the appoyntment was made bytwene theim twayne for euer.

And after came in to Acquytayne & made it to be knowen and publysshed al aboute the forme of the appointemen. And whan he had made ye trewes for syxe monethes to be cryed. He sente for his counsayll & declared vnto them the maner how he had done with ye grene knyght. So they aduysed and concluded amongest them ye the duke sholde sende messengers in euery countree there aboute, for to serche and enquyre yf there were ony knyght that wold fyght with the grene knyght for the fayre lady Fezonne. ¶ And after they sente out messengers vnto all the crysten realmes, and gaue vnto them letters, wherin was contayned the beaute of his doughter, and the enterpryse of the grene knyghte. ¶ And the duke sayd in his letters that he the whiche myght conquere the grene knyght, sholde haue his doughter in maryage. The letters were gyuen vnto twelue messengers that had the charge for to bere them vnto twelue crysten realmes, and there to publysshe and manyfeste the forsayd tydynges.

And he oppressed them so that they yelded them vnto his grace whan he had taken the cyte, he made the paynyms to be crystened, & byleue in Jhesu cryste. And gaue the cyte vnto the Marshal of Fraunce that was called Guy. ¶ After all these thinges kynge Pepyn retorned in to Fraunce with all his hoost, and a yued at Parys, and hadde tydynges anone of the duke Sauary howe he had taken trewes with the grene knyght.

And yet he shall haue with her halfe his londes and possessyon, and that it is true lo here ye lettres, holde and rede ye contenue of the same. Euery body behelde these letters gladly, but there was none so hardy nor so valyaunt that durste vndertake the enter pryse saue Ualentine that sayd before them all vnto the kynge Pepyn▪ Ryght dere syr yf it please your maieste for to gyue me leue, and lycence for to preue my strengthe in Acquytayne against the grene knight. I shal go gladly. Syr gyue me leue to go oute of Fraunce, for I haue grete desyre for to leue the countree. And I shall ryde so moche that I shal neuer reste vnto the tyme that I haue founde my moder that bare me. For it greueth me full sore that I haue ben so longe without knowynge what I am▪ Ualentyne sayd the kynge care you not what you be. For I am puyssaunte ynoughe for to gyue the goodes largely, and mounte the in honoure, and all them of my courte. And I shall holde you also dere as yf you were of min owne bloode. Syr sayd Ualentine for god pardon me, for it hathe ben my wyll longe. Whan kynge Pepyn sawe that Ualentyne was totally delybered for to go in to Acquitaine he gaue hym leue by this couenaunt that he sholde retorne vnto hym agayne also soone as he hadde foughten with ye grene knyght, yf god gaue him lyfe and hele. And valentyne promysed hym. In departynge he toke leue for to go in to Acquitayne. Than Eglantyne was more sorowfuller than euer she was before, & more replete with bytter teres. She sente for valentyne that came vnto her anone. And than she sayd vnto hym wepynge full tenderely.

I se well that of you I shall neuer haue loye nor consolacion and that you haue entencion for to leue the countrey of Fraunce. Alas nowe pleased it God that it were myne honoure for to goo with you, for euen soo God helpe me if euer I would haue other husbande but you. But sythe that it is so that I cannot be maistet after my will, and that my lyberall arbytre is kepte by other puyssaunce and that it is force that the body abyde behynde, my harte and my wil shal be with you for euer without any other intencion saue of true loue and iust without villanye I shall loue you.

My lady sayde valentyne, of gold and syluer I haue no kept, but it greueth me full sore that I can not wyte what I am.

For he sawe well that, and if it pleased him Egiantine king Pepins doughter wold go with hym whether someuer he woulde, but the witte and the reason that was in him, domined so at euery reason that he would doo no vyllaynous thynge that myght tourne him to reproche and dyshonoure afterwarde.

After this counsaill he made to assemble thirty men of the moste redoubted that he might finde. And after he sent them armed and made them go in to a forest that was both great and large, by the whiche Ualentyne and Orson

shoulde passe. God it was not longe after that valentyne and Orson that ranne on foote before hym more faster then a horse entred into the forest. Thā they were apperceyued of Grygar and his

Ualentine here must you dye, for to longe haue you lyued. When valentyne saw: that he was wounded and assayled on euery syde with enemies, he recommaunded him vnto God and vnto the glorious vyrgyn Mary, and after saide vntoo them. My lordes you haue s

And after he went to warde Grygar and began batayll with him againe muche fyerlly. Of Grygar and his men it is a pyteous thing to recounte, for they had longe speeres wherwith, they kepte Orson of: and anone they had enclosed valentyne rounde aboute, the whiche defended hym so valiauntly that the hardyest of them all durste not come within his rea

When Ualentyne was closed in the sayd dongeon, he began for to wepe right pyteously, in praying and reclaymynge god and the virgyn Mary that they woulde geue hym grace for to escape from that place. Alas sayd Ualentyne nowe am I come to the thynge that I moste doubted. That is for to were into the handes of mine enemies and of them that desired my death from daye to daye longe agone.

Orson at that time, the which also sone as he was in the palays he entred into the great hall wheras the good kynge Pepyn was, the which at that same tyme was set at the table for to dyue, accompanied with dyuers noble knyghtes and barons. whan kyng Pepyn saw Orson he wende verely that Valentyne had ben recorned. Orson went thorow the haile pyteously trying and beting his breast, for the whiche thinge the kynge and al the other beheld him sore. And whan Or son sawe the knightes set at table hee behelde thei

Alas syr kynge se and consyder the pyteous case in which orson the sauage hathe put this good knight, for god syr make that his life be taken from him, for it is to peryllous a thing to kepe such a man, Lordes sayd the king we must taste auisemente on this mater. Make him come heather and we shal know what is his entencyon &  wherfor he did it

and ye cause of his debate. Orson was brought before the kynge. Than the kinge demaunded him wherfore he had done so great outrage before his maiestie. And Orson made him signe that he had slayne & murdred Valentyne in the forest. And after he went shewyng meruaylous sygnes that he wolde fyght wyth Grigar for that thynge by the lawe of champion, & make hym confesse his cursed enterpryse and dampnable treason After he toke his hode and kest it by great fyernes vnto Grigar in maner of wage & dyffyaunce▪ And whan kinge Pepyn sawe that he called his lordes and the other barons of the courte and sayd to them al on hie, Lordes nowe haue you sene how this wilde man hath casten his gage of batayle before vs al vnto Grigar, & how he wyl fight with him. Wherfore tell me all your oppinions vpō this mater, and what is for to be done in this case, for muche I meruayle me in my hearte of this that Orson the sauage amongest al the knightes elles of my courte hathe▪ smyten Grygar so furiouslye Lordes saye on your oppynyons, for I doubte me to muche of some fal shede, what part someuer it cometh on. And as for my part wythout your counsayl or delyberacyon I shall be of the oppynyon that the bataile were iudged betwene them both. Whan the kynge had spoken in thys maner the barons were of one accord and oppynyon that Grygar and Orson should fyghte for thys quarel. Than the batayle was ordeyned. And kynge Pepyn made Grygar to be brought before hym and sayd to him that behoueth him to fight with Orson. Whan Grygar knew and vnderstode that it behoned him to fight with Orson, he was ryght sorowfull and not wythout a cause, for the time is come that the

treason that hathe ben hydde so longe, shalbe knowne manifestly before eueri body. Grigar beheld Haufray withan vnstedfast semblaunce & a frayde hearte▪ than Henry called him and sayd▪ Grygar haue no fere of nothynge, for I promyse you and let you wytte that wee shall make your peas toward the king oure father, in such wyse that your persone shal haue no domage nor vyllany in no maner of the worlde, by this condycyon that you shal sweare neuer to confesse this dede what someuer come vnto you. Alas sayde Grygar to euyll goth my cause, for I se wel that I must suffre dethe for your sakes. And whā he had sayd this he wēt toward the king saying. Syr I requyre you of a gift that is yt of your grace I fyght not with the wilde man. For syr you know wel ynough that it is not man against mā that a knyght may wynne honoure of, and also he is no natural man, but is vnreasonable and without on

                   & dysconforted. Than Haufray sayd vnto hym▪ haue no doubte, for yf you haue good ryght god shal healpe you and be your shelde and defence in this quarel. And as for my part I shal make you to be armed wel and sufficiently as it apperteyneth vnto such a case. And whan Orson vnderstode that he shuld fyght he made grete Joye. Many grete signes made Orson vnto the kyng that Ualentine was deed and destroyed. Of the whiche signes king Pepin meruayled sore. Euer was Orson redy for to smyte Grygar the fals traytour, but the king Pepin made him to be taken, and to bee kepte

in his presence, in making him signes that he shoulde smyte hym no more vntyl the time that he wer in the felde. After he sayd vnto Grigar, go and arm you, and thynke for to defend your quarel wel. Ha syr sayd Grigar I haue serued you longe time, & withall my puissaunce haue enforced me for to obey you in al thinges as wel in batayl as wythoute, but euyll rewarde you yelde me, whan that you wyll make me fyght agaynst this wylde man that hathe neyther wytte nor reason. Grygar sayd kyng Pepyn if you haue good right you ought not to be dysmayed of nothynge, for I promyse you that you shal be wel armed, and Orson shalbe put into the felde al naked and without armour. You shall be on horsback, and he shal be on fote without bering ony wepen, wherby you shal haue no cause for recule a backe from defendyng of your ryghte. I can not tell how it shal befal you, but you shewe wel the sēblaunt that there is somwhat to say in you, do your deuoyre and defend your ryght, for you shall haue none other thynge of me, the cause is consumed, and the conclusy on made and taken of my counsayll.

And when he was ready Orson that was abidyng e

Lordes I go dye for you. Euill was the daye for me when I enterprysed suche a thyug. Holde your peace sayd Henry and take no thought, for I haue promysed you to make your peace to wathe my father the whiche I will holde, so that and you be vanquished by Orson, your body shall haue no harme. And if that he would domage you in any maner, there should rather dye an hundred thousande men then we should faile on

out syde, be euer secrete and knowledge neuer nothyng of the deede that is done, nor of the enterpryse. Grygar was armed and mounted on horsebacke, and so he rode towarde the fielde that was ordeined before the palais. And when the houre was come that they should fight, the kyng came to the wyndowes for to beholde the batayle. When al the court was assembled and the iudges ordayned for to iudge the bataill, it was commaunded to both the parties that they shoulde do their deuoyre. Than Grygar entred into the fielde with muche pryde mounted at auauntage, wherfore it befell hym euill at the ende. He sporred his horse and drewe towarde Orson saying. Rybaude thou hast done me to great outrage whā thou put out one of min eien through thy cruel nes, but I shall shewe the that with wronge and without cause thou haste assayled me. ¶ And when Orson sawe him come, he vnderstode hym well, and stratched forth his armes, and she wed his nayles and his teeth, grennyng full hugely. Then Grygar couched his spere and ranne towarde Orson. When Orson sawe the spere come he gaue a lepe backward. And Grygar that had fayled of his stroke fixed his speere in the fielde. Whan Orson sawe that he retourned to him and tooke the spere, and when that Orson hadde the spere in his hande, he gaue hym so great a stroke that he loste witte and vnderstāding in such wyse that he wist not where he was. When Grygar was smyten he sporred horse and fledde about the fielde, and Orson ranne after makyng a grymly countenaunce, and shewyng the kyng that he woulde yelde hym matte anone. And when Grygar apperceyued the great daunger that he was in, he sayde within himselfe. A Haufray I muste dye for you.

I had well sayde it euyll is the thing begon and euill shal it finishe. In this maner Grygar could not woūde Orson in no wyse. And when Orson sawe this he

                  he kept him that he caught his horse by the necke and he made him turne so oftē about that he made him fall, but when he felte his horse fal he would haue lept out of his sadle, and at the lepe he lost his shelde, for it fell down and Orson ranne to it and anone put it vpō hym, and went towarde the horse and mounted vpon hym, and in makyng marueylous sygnes he roode after Grygar that fled about in the fielde. To se the countenaunce of Orson euery body was abasshed. And the kyng Pepyn amongest the other was muche pensyfe for this case, and sayde before them all. By God almi

                  hey lordes I marueyle me muche of this feate, and I can tell what to thynke, nor to what ende it wil come but whatsoeuer it be, or what may happen it is myne opinion that there is treason ryght greate somwhere: The kyng was pensyfe vpon this enterpryse. And Orson that was mounted on horsebacke for to pursue Grygar descended of the horse and wente vnto him on fote, and he gaue suche a stroke that he smote him down to the grounde, and after he lepte vpon him and tooke his sworde and his dagger from him, after he gaue him so mighty a stroke that he smote of his arme and hys shoulder. And then he gaue hym another marueylous stroke in the body so that he cut his reynes of his back in two. And Grygar escryed soo hye that euerye body herde it in demaundyng a priest for to be confessed of his synnes and to haue absolucion of them. And when the gardes of the fielde vndrstode hym a muche notable

knyght that had the charge went to ward him and demaunded hym what he woulde, and then Grygar sayd vnto hym. Syr make the kyng Pepyn descende, for I will before all the worlde tell and confesse the falsnes and treason of my case. ¶ Then this thyng was sygnifyed to the kyng Pepyn all clearely what he had sayde.

               WHen Grygar sawe the kynge he cryed hym mercye. And recounted vnto him howe that by the commaundement of Haufray and Henry he had taken Ualentyne & put hym in pryson tyll lye be iudged

to deathe, Whan kynge Pepyn knew the trouth of the mater, he commaunded to hang Grygar. Sith he moū ted on horsbacke for to go vnto the pryson that valen tyne was in. whan Orson vnberstode that the kinge wold go, he ranne before hym makyng grete chere to hym shewynge hym the waye. And the kynge sayd often. Lordes it is a great thyng of thys wyld man that loueth Valentine thus, & know that his manners styreth me much for to do hym some good. The kynge loued hym moche and wel he oughte to do so, for he was his propre neuew but he knew it not. Nor yet he shal not knowe it tyll that by Clerymonde syster vnto the gyaunre Ferragus it be shewed. For that same Clerimonde had a castell wherin was a heed of brasse composed by Nygromancye that tolde her all the thynges that shuld happen her in the time to come, and also the whyche was passed. And yet this same heed was composed of suche arte that it shuld neuer finishe tyl that the moost hardyest knyght of the world entred into the castell, for than it shold lease the speche and all the vertue. Now there shal come one that shal make it finish. And that shall be Ualentyne, that the fayre ladye Cleremonde that take, for the whiche he shal endure and suffre great peryls & daungers, as you shal here more playnly afterward. So I wyl leaue to speake of thys mater and wyll retorne vnto kynge Pepyn that goth toward the forest for to saue Ualentyne and preserue him from death. He hath done so muche that he is entred in to the forest and gothe folowynge Orson that ledde hym vnto the castell. But whan they wer comē vnto the castel the porters that knewe the kyng shytte the gates incontynent, for so they were cōmaunded of

them within the castell vpon payne of their liue. The

                   when the kyng sawe that he might not enter in to the castell but by force. He commaunded his men that the place should be assayled. So it was not long after that the dytches were fylled with wodde. And after they ap proched nere the walles and entred in to the castell by force of armes. When they were within the castell they toke all the traytours and bounde them streighly. And after they went into the depe prysons where as Ualētyne was and toke him out and brought him vnto the kyng Pepyn. When Ualentyne sawe the kyng he

                  ded that the traytours should be lead into the wodde, and there to be hanged and strangled on one tree with out any remission. Then kyng Pepyn spake vnto valentyne and sayde. Ualentyne my frende sythe that god hath geuen you the grace to be thus Joyously escaped from the handes of your enemies. I counsayl you that you retourne agayne with me. Syr sayde valentyne, for goddes sake pardon me, for I shall neuer retourne vnto the tyme that I knowe what I am, and of what place extraught. Wherfore I take hehe leue of you as he that woulde serue you to my power. At these woordes they departed. Here leue I to speake of the kynge

and

                  ll speake of Ualentine and Orson that is going into Acquitaine for to fyght with the grene knyghte that feareth no man, for as I have tolde you before he shall neuer be vanquysshed but of a kynges sonne that neuer had souked womans breastes. Thus goeth Ualentine and Orson together toward the countrey of Acquitayne. All the worlde ran for to se Orson that was all naked and rough as a beer. Euery body did laughe at him but he set not therby. Then Ualētine made for to make him a 
                     •
                  acerā of fyne stele, which was of such a fasion that it had a hode that was fastened to it. And when Orson had it on him he thought him much wilde and would haue put it of gladly, but he feared Ualentyne muche, for all that he cōmaunded him he did without contradiction. When Orson was clothed in the

                  ceran of stele he behelde himselfe strongly, and kepte a proude countenaunce. Now it happened that as they passed vpon their waye Ualentine espied a right faire squyer that passed therby, the whiche wepte full tenderly. When Ualentyne sawe that he sayd vnto him frend what ayled you for to wepe, haue you founde any euil men, or haue you feare of the wylde beastes, tell me for I shall helpe you after my power. Alas sayd the squier of all this I haue no doubte, but knowe that the thyng that causeth me for to wepe is my maister that I haue lost, the whiche was the moste courteous the moste amiable, and the moste valiaūt that was vpō the earth. Ualentyne sayde howe haue you lost him. ¶ Syr said the squyer he went into Acquitayne for to fyght with the grene knight, for to haue one of the fayrest ladyes in the worlde, that is the pleasaunt lady Fezonne that hath her harte so gracious and noble, but there shall

neuer none haue her if the grene knyght be not ouercome in cleane batayle. Nowe there is dyuers valyaunte knyghtes dead. And when he hath conquered them he maketh them to be hanged on a tree that is in the place on the whiche tree is hanged dyuers knyghtes to the nombre of two & thyrty. He taketh no mercy of none he is so truell a

                  elon. Holy vyrgyn Mary sayd Ualentyne I thynke he is some deuell when he doeth suche thynges but and it please Ihesus I shall go in to Acquytayne, and shall proue my body against hym, for I haue hearde so muche speakyng of the fayre lady Fezoune that if I dye not shortly I shall know the truth. Ha syr sayde the squyer for God goo not thether, for yf you fyght with him you shall lese your payne, and you are so fayre a knyght that I neuer sawe none such. Lese not your lyfe for to fyght with that deuill, for I haue sene hym put so many noble men vnto death that I haue great doubte of you if you fyght with hym. Squyer sayde Ualentyne in to Acquytayne will I goo, and of the grene knight I shall knowe the truthe, & if he haue euill cause agaynst hym wyll I fyght, but if I may I wyll speake fyrst with the fayre lady Fezonne, and doo after her counsayle. And when Orson vnderstode him he made sygnes vnto Ualentyne that he longed for to fyght with the grene knyght, and that he wold loue the fayre Fezonne. When valentyne vnderstoode hym for great ioye he laughed. Thus go the two brethren walkyng through the countrey for to go vnto Acquytayne So they haue ryden so muche that they are aryued besyde the tyrie. Ualentine sawe it from farre for it stode onhye. Then he called an olde man that passed by and demaunded him what 
                     〈◊〉
                   it was that he sawe before

hym. Syr sayde the goodman it is Acquitayne. Nowe tell me saybe valentyne where doth the grene knyght holde hym. Syr sayde he besyde the cytie, I thynke you go for to fyght with him. Yea truly saide Ualentine. A sir you vndertake a great foly, for you shal neuer haue victory on him. Mounte vpon this litle hyland be hold where as hangeth vpon a tree moo then forty that he hath put to death. There is no more then fiftene dayes of respyte that the duke of Acquitayne shalbe constrained for to geue vnto him his doughter the fayrest of the worlde, the whiche shall be great dommage. Frend sayd Ualentine God shal helpe her. Thus as valētine spake vnto this man an auncient man came to warde him in the habyte of a pylgrym euill clothed the which had a great whyte bearde, and was of the aege of four score yeare. This man was Blandymayn the squyer of Bellyssant that ledde herinto the castell where as the gyaunt Ferragus was as it is made mencion of before. Ualentine salued the pylgrym and demaunded hym from whence he came. And he aunswered hym. Syr I come from Constantinoble, but I myght not entre in to the cytie for a paynim Soudan that hathe assyeged it. I might not do there my message, wherefore I retourne me.

Nowe is the good lady in the house of a gyaunt that kept her ful swetely, the whiche wyll go into Fraunce for to wyte if kyng Pepyn be consentyng, For so well he knoweth the lady of good maners and condicions that he wyll fyght in a fyelde of batayle against the Emperoure of Grece that he hath falsly & euilly expulsed her: Frend

                   sayde Ualentyne to him. I praye the in the name of God almyghty that thou retourne againe with vs into Acquytayne. And when I shall haue foughten with the grene knyght, if God my creature geue me victory against hym I shall retourne in to Fraunce with you. And for the loue of kyng Pepyn I vndertake this battayle for I am more beholden vnto hym then vnto any man liuing. It is he that hath bene my father, and hath nourysshed me so well, that I ought well to haue the courage and will for to doo his commaundement and pleasure. Syr sayde Blandimain I will neuer consent vnto this. For I will goo and do my message for the noble lady Bellyssant, for she hath geuē me the charge and I will serue her truely. God be with you both the whiche kepe you from all euill. So Blandymayne departed and toke his waye towarde Parys. And Ualentyne behelde him right strongly. Alas it was not with out a cause. He had good right if his harte drew to him for it was he that of longe time had saued and kept his mother, but he knewe it not. They tooke their waye. And went so longe that they aryued besyde the cytie of Acquitayne. Ualentyne behelde the cytie sore that was ryght pleasaunt to se. After valentyne espyed a fountayne and went the

                  her and alyght of his horse, & after

he layde hym downe vnder a tre that was besyde it for to refreshe hym for he had greate heate, he reposed hym a lytell and slepte and Orson kept him. And whan he had reposed hym and was awakened he rose vp vpon his fete for to mount on horsback, but there came and arryued ther a knight that was fyerse and proud, and that for his grete pryde was called the proud knyght, For he was so fyerse that neuer the dayes of his lyfe he had salued no man. And yet he was of such a condicion that he that salued hym not shuld haue bataill against hym, wher throughe he had made dyuers dye. He came toward the fountayne and set fote on ground, and Ualentyne behelde hym and sayd neuer a worde, and than he aduysed Orson that beheld hym fiersly. The proud knight had dyspyte in his hearte and approched neare Orson, and gaue hym suche a stroke that he made the bloode yssue out of his mouth. And whan Orson felt hym self smiten he toke the knight betwene his armes so rudely that he thre we hym downe vnder him, & sith he toke a knife that hanged at the knightes gyrdle and smote hym in to the body so that the bloode yssued oute by grete habundaunce. And the knyghte that felde hym selfe wounded cryed right hye. Than Valentyne approched and toke the knight out of Orsons handes, & said to him. Fayre syr you haue wrōg for to smite this pore man that can not speke a word. Than sayd the proud knyghts vnto Valentyne. Proude ryvaude wherefore dost thou not salue me.

Of the which tydynges was moche angrye and dyspleasaunt the duke Sauary, for he was his cosin. Ualentyne herde the sorowe that the proude knightes men made, that had ben put to de the besyde the fountayne. So he mounted on horsbacke & entred into the cyte.

Knyght sayd the duke you haue slayne my cosyn and put hym vnto death. It is trewe sayde the noble knyghte Valentyne, I saye not the contrary, and yf that he hadde bene of my propre lignage I woulde haue done as muche, for he was proude and fyerse of courage, he dayned not speke to grete nor litel by his pryde he hathe smyten my felowe soo that he felled hym, and whan I sawe that I drewe my swearde and slewe hym. I am a straunger that are comen in to this cyte for to fyght with the grene knyght, & for tose the pleasant Lady Fezonne that is so muche renowne you haue made the waies that euery knight shal come

So it semeth me ryghte and iuste equitie that throughe at your lande one ought to go in surete in the hye way And whan the duke Sauary herd Ualentine speke so he sayd vnto him Knight wel haste thou answered, yf my cosin be deed, it is by his Pride and fyerse courage, of his death I am sorowfull, but there is no remedye, wherefore I pardone the that deede, and I wyll be pardoned. But for the surplus of your enterpryse of the grene knight, you shal come into my palays, and shall se the lady for whom you are comē into these quarters And with her you shal find. xiiii. knights of straunge countrees newlye comen, that for the loue of her will right againste the grene knight. Go theder & salue my doughter as the custom is. For so it is ordeined that al knightes that cometh hether for the loue of her, before that they do ony batayl with the grene knight, they present them to her. And in signe of loue they take a ringe of goulde of her. Sir saide Ualentine I am readye to do as the ordinaunce biddeth. And of the other syde I am your litle seruaunt, as he that wold obey vnto all your good commaundementes after my puyssaunce. Than the duke Sauarye mounted into the castell, and Ualentine and orson accompanyed him much honourably. They entred into the halle whereas the knights wer that accompanyed the fayre Fezonne. And whan valentine sawe her, he went toward her in grete reuerence, and salued her sayinge before them al.

For he is marueylusly well made of his membres, and well formed, streight and hardy of countenaunce, & I beleue that & he were bayned in a hoote house, his flesshe woulde be whyte and softe.

Then when Ualentyne had spoken so to the mayden, he sayde yet agayne vnto her. Lady as touchyng me I shall tell you my case, knowe that for the loue of you I am come into this countrey for to conquere you valyauntly by force of armes. And yet I haue made an othe that I shal neuer retourne into Fraunce vnto the time that I haue foughte and proued my body agaynst the grene knyght. ¶ For knowe that for the loue of you I wyll suffer death, or yelde you the grene knyghte ouercome in to your handes.

Lady sayd valentyne of this you shall pardon me, for thus I haue promysed it. Knyght said Fezonne well maye it take you. Than drewe she out two rynges of golde, and gaue valentyne one & Orson the other, after they sat them downe at the table with the other fortene knyghtes, where as ryght nobly the duke Sauary made them to be serued. But amongest al thē that were at the table, Fezonne had her regarde moste vpon Orson. And Orson beheld her by a desyre of loue embraced and inspyred with an ardaunt and gracious apppetyte. Nowe it happened that as ye knightes were syttyng at the table, the grene knyght came smytyng at the gate for to se the fayre Fezonne that he loued soo muche. For the duke Sauaray and he had made suche a contracte together that he might come once a daye and se her at his pleasure. And then when he was entred he

cryed all on hygh saying. Valyaunt duke of Acquitain haue you a champyon yt wil fyghte wyth my body for the fayre lady Fezonne. Ye sayd the Duke, yet haue I syxtene within my halle, that for to she we theyr prow esse agaynst euery body and you bene comen from dyuers realmes into this countre. Now said the grene knyght make that I maye se them, and that I entre in to the hal for to se the faire lady Fezōne. Enter in said the duke for you haue lycence. The greene knyghte entred into the halle and behealde all the knyghtes that were there. And whan he had beholden them he sayd to them thus, Lordes ete and drynke and make good the re, for to moro we shall be youre laste daye. And knowe that I shall make you all to bee hanged on the hygheste of all my tree. Than Valentyne that herd him was euyl contente and answered hym. Knyghte of that same vaunt you might haue hold your tongue. For to dayis comen a knyght that shal fyght with you more asprely than euer dyd onye heare before, you haue delyuered many vnto deathe, but he is commen that shall vaynequisshe you in a felde by force of armes. ¶ Now Orsō vnderstode that they spake of him, and knewe that the grene knight was he by whom the Justes were begon nen, & that it was he by whome so mani noble knights had suffred dethe. So he beheld hym fyetsly, and after lept from the table, and in whettinge his tethe he toke the grene knight by the midle and charged him vpōhis necke, as a lytell chyld. And whan he hadde him vppon his necke he espyed a wall and caste the grene knyghte agaynst it so rudely, that all they that were in the pi

                  te wende that he hadde broken his necke. For he remeued not. And wan he had done so he sat him down againe

amongest his felowes, and in laughyng made theim signes that he would bere vpon his necke such thre as the grene knight. Then began all the knightes of the halle for to laughe strongly, & said the one to the other. Nowe is he come that shall discomfite and ouercome the grene knyght. And Fezonne shall haue to greate a losse whan he can not speake. For he is well worthy to haue honour amongest the valiauntmen. When Fezonne had well beholden the maners and countenasi
                     •
                  e of Orson, she was smiten to the harte with the darte of loue by the pleasure of God & of the virgin Mary, that yllumyned both their two hartes in suche a facion that she gaue vnto him al her courage and wil, and she had euer her regarde fyxed vpon Orson, and began for to loue hym so ardauntly that she forgate al the other for to haue him to her louer. And it was not without a cause if she were so taken with his loue. For he had taken the grene knight vp so valiauntly that at yt same houre he might haue slayne hym if he had woulde, but howe well that he had puyssaunce ouer hym yet he would do him no harme. For it is commonly sayde that a noble courage can not lye. Notwithstāding the grene knight reputed this dede for a great outrage. And sayd all on hyghe before al the cōpany. ¶Lordes this same wilde man hath deceyued and betrayed me, for he came to me without saying any worde. I promise and let you wyte that to morowe in the mornyng I shall be a man for hym. And to the ende that all other take ensample by hym, in dyspyte I shall make a gy

                  ORson apperceyued well yt the grene knight was not well content with hym, and that he menaced hym. So he began for to momble a peace and makyng sygnes that vpon the morowe he woulde fyghte with hym,

and in token of wage the cast the grene knight his hod Then spake Ualētyne vnto the grene knight and said. Syr beholde the gage that the wylde man casteth to you, if you haue any power against hym thynke for to take it vp. Than was the grene knyght so taken with pryde & dispyte that he aunswered neuer a worde. And the duke Sauary that was there present said vnto him Free knight there wyll be a strong batayll betwene the wylde man and you, and I feare me sore that you shal haue muche a do with hym. And if that you may do so much as to haue victory ouer him, you may wel vaunt you that of all knightes you are the moste doughty & valiaunt, and that of none you ought to haue feare nor dreade. And that it be true he hath shewed you before al that he is hardy of harte & of courage. By my god sayde the grene knyght to morowe shall you all se and know what his puissaunce is, for neuer in this lyfe shall he retourne from the fielde till I make hym to be hanged aboue al the other. At these wordes he yssued out of the castell and went vnto his rest in his pauilion. And the other lordes and knyghtes remayned with the fayre la dy Fezonne, the which made great ioye and solace, and sayd the one to the other that the daye was come that the grene knyght should fynde his maister. Great noyse was thorough the cytie of Orson the sauage, euery body desyred for to se hym, ye in suche maner yt so great nombre of folke came into the palais, that for the prese that was there the duke commaunded that the gates should be shytte. ¶whā Orson harde the noyse hel
                     •
                  pt vp vpon a baye wyndowe for to beholde the people that were without. Than the folkes apperceyued hym and shewed hym one to another in speakyng and deuysyng

of him in diuers maners & facions. The nyght was come so that it was time to go to souper, tho was euery body set and serued. So when the duke was rysen from the table anone after came in playes, and after euery body went into their chambres. When Ualen tyne was in bedde he made sygnes to Orson that he should lye downe by hym, but Orson set not therby, for he layde hym downe platte to the earth as he was accustomed to do in the forest, and so he passed the nyght, when the daye was come. Ualentyne and Orson went into the hall where as they founde the fayre lady Fezonne with the other knightes. There they helde counsayll together for to fyght with the grene knight. For yt same daye the duke had promysed hym to delyuer hym a champion to fyght with him. So there spake among them a ryght noble knyght that was extraught out of a gētle bloud and said in this maner. Lordes if it please you all I am purposed for to fyght first with the grene knight. This requeste was a
                     •
                  oorded to him by the assistentes of all chyualty, and the knyght went for to arme hym, the whiche was called Galetam, and was come out of the realme of Fraunce. And when he was arm

                   he came before the pleasaunt lady Fezonne, and toke his leue of her ioyously with great reuerence, and she that was garnyshed with all honour and good cō
                  dicions vttred hym leue in saiyng. Fre knyght I pray to god of paradyse, and to the blyssed and glorious virgyn Mary that they conduyte you, and kepe you and preserue you from damage, in suche maner and facion that with ioye and honoure ye may retourne vnto me agayne. And he thanked her with all his harte, and thē he toke leue of his felowes. When he hadde taken leue

of the fayre Fezonne he mounted on horsbacke & went to warde the tente of the grene knighte. O
                     •
                   as ferro as he saw him he smote his hors with the sporres & with a fyerse courage rannt to the knyght Galeram, and so grete a stroke he gaue hym that he smote hym do wne to the grounde than he discended of his hors, and toke his helm of his hed. Wherfore Galeram that fered the death yelded him vnto the mercy of the grene knyghte, but it profyted hym lytel. For without ony pite he dispoyled him of his harneis, & hanged him on the height of the tre so as he hadde done the other before. For the dethe of the same Galeram was greate bruyt throughe the cyte of Acquitaine, for he was a much fayre knight and gretely praised among his felowes. Now Orson knewe wel that the grene knight had put to deathe galeram. He made sygnes with his handes that he wold go fight with him at the same houre without ony more delay, but Valentine made hym syne that he shoulde withdrawe him, for he wold go fyrste. As than Orson helde hym styll, for he fered Valentyne alwayes.:,
               Than the noble and hardy Ualētyne armed him and after went toward the fayre Fezonne for to take loue of her. Soo it is not to be demaunded yf she bewayled him muche and yf she caste mani couered sighes with in her ryght noble herte. Alas sayde the fayre and pleasaunt lady Fezonne. My god please▪ it the to defende & preserue this noble, fayre, and gracyous knighte, that for the loue of me wyl put hys lyfe in daunger. Much be waylled Fezonne the amyable knighte Valentyne, but aboue all other her mynde was vpon Orson, and she had a good cause, for god had put hym on the earth for to be her husband. After the leue taken of the Lady

and of al the knyghts Ualentyne moūted on horsback for to go fyght with the grene knyght. But euen so as he put hym on the way came to him a knight that was enbraced with the loue of the fayre Lady Fezonne, and sayde to hym. Syr haue a lytel pacyence and let me go the fyrste. Frende sayd Ualentyne I gyue the leaue, goo in the name of Jesus why she gyue the puyssaunce and vyctorye for to conquere him. That same knight hadde to name Tyrys, and was borne in the countre of Sauoye, but so muche greate pyte was in his case, that for to put hym in that auenture he had spended all hys, so that he had no more lefte. He toke leaue of thee Lordes, and syth mounted on horsbacke, & wythout ony soiour nynge he rode to the pauilion of the grene knight. And whan he sawe Tyrys approche he lept'out of hys tente muche fyersly and proudlye. And Tyrys escryed hym, sayinge. Syr grene knyght nowe mount on horsbacke and thynke to defend you. For on goddes behalue I defy you that hathe made all the world, and for vs suffred deathe and passyon. The greene knyghte that Tyrys vnderstode called for to haue hys hors, & one of hys seruauntes brought hym anone, than he set his fote in the styroye and lept vpon his backe. He toke his grene sheld and his speare, and after they wythdrewe theym for to fetche theyr course, and they encountred so impetuously that the grene knyght smote hym throughe the bodye with his spere and so he fell downe deade. And incontinent the grene knyght dyscended and toke a corde and put it about his neck and hanged him vp with ye other wherfore ye Painims and Sarasins made grete Joye And whan Ualentyne saw that Tyrys was deed and hanged on the tre, he was sorye for his deathe and dyspleasaunt.

He made the sygne of the crosse before hym, and recommaunded hym vnto god, in desyrynge aboue all thynges that he wolde do so much that of his fader & moder he might haue perfyte knowledge. And whan he had made his prayer vnto god he smote his hors wt the sporres and rode to the tente of the grene knyghte, that for the semblaunt of Orson knew hym well, and of hym he had more doubte than euer he had of ony before. He called Ualentyne and sayd to him. Knyght vnderstande that I shall tell the, feest thou 
                     •
                  onder vpon that tree a grene shelde go and fetche it me and I shal deserue it. Syr sayd Ualentyne you haue seruauntes ynoughe mo than me, wherfore make that they serue you, for by me you shall not haue yt shelde. By my lawe sayd the grene knyght you shall fetche me the shelde, or I let you knowe that neuer agaynst my body shall you haue batayll. Whan valentyn sawe that the grene knyghte wolde take excusacion for fetchynge of the shelde as a hardy and valyaunt knyght he rode towarde the tre where as the shelde hanged (but he loste his payne) for he myght not haue it wherfore he was ryght sorowful. Than he came vnto the grene knyght and sayd to him fyersly. To fetche thy shelde, for I can not haue it Cursed be he of god that fastened it so, and hāged may he be that sente me theder. Frende sayd the grene knyghte I shall tel the wherfore I sente the theder. Knowe for certaynte that this same shelde came whylom out of y• faree, & by a fare it was gyuen me. Now it hathe suche vertue that neuer none be he neuer so valyaunt nor stronge maye take it out of the place where as it is fastened, saue he alonely by whome I ought to be conquered and vanquysshed. Therfore I haue sente the therder

warde, for of the I hadde doubte, but nowe I am sure whan that the shelde thou mayst not brynge. Wherfore retorne the to the place that thou came fro, and so thou shalte saue thy lyfe. For I se the so fayre a knyght that I haue none enuye of thy dethe, from the whiche thou can not escape yf thou take batayll agaynst me. And to the ende that thou thynke not that I tell the these wordes by fayntyse or folysshe abusyon, knowe that of none I shall be vaynquysshed be he neuer soo vyctoryous saue but of a man that shal be a kynges sone and that shall haue be nourysshed 
                     •
                  out womans mylke, wherby thou mayst knowe yf thou be suche or not. Of these tydynges Ualentyne was sorowfull and dyspleasaūt at his herte and sayd. Alas good lorde god almyghty to euyll go the my feate yf that of youre benygne grace I haue no socoure and conforte. For I knowe well that I am not suche one as the paynym sayeth. But syth that I haue done soo moche that I am comen heder for to encheue this enterpryse, I shall neuer retorne vnto the tyme that I haue assayed my body agaynst hym that hathe done so many noble knyghtes vnto dethe. Than Ualentyne called the grene knyght and sayd to hym in this maner. Favregrene knyght I se and knowe that I am not he by whome you ought to be conquered, but not for that what someuer I am I shal neuer departe from hens tyll that I haue foughten agaynst you. By Mahoune sayd the paynyms grete folye ledeth the, and semeth that thou wylll conquere me by treason, but I shal shewe the a none that thyn ouerwenynge shal torne the vnto grete dōmage and shame. Than he lepte on his hors & badde his seruaunt. Gobert bryng his boxe with baume of our lorde Ihesu cryst the whiche baume

as we finde by wrytynge is of so grete vertue and meryte yt there is no mortall wounde, nor so daungerous that whan it shall be enoynted with the same baume, but that it shall behole anone. This same oyntemente had the paynym with hym of longe tyme surely kepte, the whiche had saued him in diuers places. After that he had done this, he sporred his hors with the spere on his thye, and are comen the one agaynst the other, and so fyersly they recountred the one the other with theyr speres, that the peces flewe on euery syde, ye horses passed forthe. And whan they had fetched theyr cours they drewe out theyr bryghte swerdes for to assayll the one the other. Ualentine was dylygente & hardy in armes so moche that with his sooerde he gaue the grene knyghte so grete a stroke that he cut his harneys and broke it so that he made the blodde renne oute of his body by grete haboundaunce. And whan the grene knyght felt hymselfe smyten and wounded, he lyfte vp his arme on heyght, and with the swerde that he bare he smote Ualentyne vpon ye thyghe so grete a stroke, that of his flesshe he smote awaye a grete pece, syth he sayd to hym you may knowe yf that I can playe with the swerde, I haue tolde you ynoughe before that & you wolde vndertake the felde agaynst me that thrughe my handes it sholde behoue you to fynysshe your dayes. In to soone a tyme came you towarde me▪ and to late you shall retorne, for I haue hope that anone I shall take you, and hange you on the hyghest braunche of my tree for to prepayre the place, & to kepe company with the other vnhappy that by theyr pryde & foly haue suffred dethe Paynym sayd Ualentyn of this thou mayst not a

In this wyse they were fyghtynge so lōg that the daye faylled them and they felte them selfe ryght wery, and not without acause. Sorowfull & right dyspleasaunt was the grene knyght bycause he myght not ouercome valentyne. And for all that he was wery yet he shewed not the semblaunt, but sayd vnto valentyne. Knyght from hens forth it behoueth for to cea se the batayll, for I se that you are moche trauaylled &

Ualentyne was ryghte gladde for to leaue the greane knyghte, for he was wery and sore wounded. So he went toward his hors that was entred into a greane fielde, he tooke hym by the brydell and mounted vppon hym for too retorne into Acquitaine.

The duke sauary and the other barons yssued out of the gate and receiued Ualentine with grete honour, among the whiche was Orson that tooke him in his armes and made hym greate cheare. And whan he was in the palays the Duke Sauarye demaunded him tidmges of the Grene knyght. Syr sayd Ualentyne he is in his repayre with in his grene Pauilion where as he reasteth hym.

                  AL that same nyghte the chylde valentyne slepe not in his bedde, but wepte & syghed ful pyteously without ony restesaynge. Alas veray god almyghtye nowe se I well the I shall neuer come to the ende of myn enterpryse, but yf that of thyne inestymable grace and boūte thou haue pyte on me. In gyuyng me ayde and conforte agaynst this false paynym that hathe sworne my dethe Alas myn entencyon and purpose was stedfastlye concluded

that my bodye should neuer haue reast vnto the tyme that I might haue acknowledge of ye fader that engendred me, and of what moder I was borne, and delyuered on the earthe, but I knowe that the thinge the which a man purposeth cometh notal waies to effect but remayneth vndone. For me I may well saye it, for whan I enterprysed the batayll agaynste the Greane knyght, fortune was to peruers vnto me sythe that he is suche that he maye neuer bee vainequished saue of a knyght that is a kinges sonne and that in such maner he shuld haue bene nourished so in his youthe that neuer of woman he shuld fele the milke. Now am I not he that may be so worthy for to be a kings sone, & that in such maner I haue ben nouryshed in my youthe, so I se no confort in my feare that may preserue me from deathe, saue alonelye to inuoke and requyre the ayde of my creatoure Iesus and his swete mother Marye, so that they preserue me from his daunger, and suffre me not to fynysshe my dayes here thus pyteously, In thys contempla

                  ion abode Ualentine al the nyght wythout ony reast saue for to wepe his fortune and his ferefull aduenture. And whan he had euerye where thoughte by dyuyne operacyon he bethought hym on Orson the sauage that he had conquered in the wodde, and soo hee thought that by him he might be socoured, for he thoughte well that he had neuer souked no womans breste. And that by auenture it myghte haue fallen that some Quene had chylded hym in the forest. And these thynges consyderynge the nyght toke an ende, and the day began to cleare. Than Ualentine arose charged wyth thought and melancoli and came toward Orson, and by euident signs shewed him that he shuld put on his

harneys and take his hors for to go fyght with the grene knyghte. Of these tydynges was Orson ryght Joyous and lepte and daunced aboute the halle for gladnes. Soo he made sygne that the grene knyght sholde neuer escape his handes. And in makynge these signes he aduysed a grete clubbe of wodde, the whiche he toke vpon his necke in shakynge his heed, and made sygnes with his heed and his armes that he wolde bere none other harneys against the false paynym, or hors nor spere at all for to fyght with the gyaunt. Frende sayd Ualentyn you shal not do so. But with myne armoure I wyll that you be armed, in berynge ye blason that was gyuen me by the kynge Pepyn, and you shall ryde on the stede that I brought out of Fraunce with me. To the wyll of valentyne Orson agreed and accorded, for aboue all thynges he wolde obeye vnto valentyne and his commaundementes, as his subgecte and seruaunte, Than valentyne commaunded that they sholde brige hym his harneys, and that Orson sholde be armed in ye same maner that he was whan he wente for to fyghte with the grene knyght. The thynge was done and accomplysshed for the duke Sauary that was there present helped for to arme Orson with his propre handes with the armoure of valentyne, with dyuers barons that were there. And whan Orson was armed he was moche loked on of the lordes and barons that was there presente, for he semed ryght well to be a man of grete prowesse and hardynesse▪ replete with all beaute hye and well formed in all his membres by ryghte mesure compassed.

And whan Orson hadde taken leaue of the duke Sauarye he enbraced Ualentyne and toke leue of hym in makynge hym sygne that he shuld haue no doubte of nothynge. And that afore his retornynge he wolde brynge the grene knyght wyth hym either quycke or deede. And Ualentine in weapynge and lamentynge commaunded hym to God in prayinge deuoutly that he myght haue victory against the painim And euen so departed Orson, but or he moūted on hors backe he aduysed hym on the fayre Fezonne of the whiche he had not taken leue, so he mounted into the palais and entred into the halle whereas was the fayre ladye Fezonne and dyuers other Ladyes well accompanyed, He ranne toward her and wolde haue kyssed her, where at the Lady and dyuers other began for to laugh ryghte strongly.

And semblablye Orson withdrew hym from hym, and than they began to couche theyr speres and in suche wyse encountred to gyder that both men and horses fel vnto the earth. And whan they were both downe they arose vp agayne lyghtly and drew out theyr swerdes for to assayl the one the other right vigorously. The grene knight that was moche prydefull and full of Ire smote Orson fyrst with so great myght that he cut the cercle of golde vpon hys helme / and smote downe a greate quarter of his

Whan Orson sawe his bloode renne down alonge hys harme he was more fyerser than a Leoparde, and more courageous than a lyon. He rolled his eyen and shaked his head, and with his bright swearde he gaue the Gyaunte so grete a stroke vpon his head that he touched his naked flesh / and bare away a grete quantyte of the flesh & heer withall, and the stroke slyded downe and hyt hym on the arme so that the bloud ranne down haboundaūt ly.

moche abasssed, and he thought well within hymselfe that with wepen he myght not haue his body, whan yt so soone he hadde heled the wounde that was so grete, and so profounde. Upon this mater was Orson subtyl and w

And whan he had hym vnderneth hym, he toke his helme of his heed, for to haue smyten it of. There was the grene knight kepte in suche subgeccon that by force he was constrayned for to yelde hym vnto Orson, and to crye hym mercye but Orson that vnderstode nothynge his crienge sette not therby in no maner.

From this houre I denye and renunce all the false goddes, and take for the remenaunt of my lyfe for mayster and lorde the true god in whiche you by leue, and in that same fayth wyll I lyue and dye.

Whan the grene knyght had made the othe, and promyse to accomplysshe the thynges aboue sayd. Ualentin made signe vnto Orson that he sholde let hym ryse. And Orson that was wyse and well auysed toke his armoure frome hym to the ende yt he myght do hym no dommage. And whan the grene knyght was vpon his fete he spake to valentyne and sayd. Syr knyght me thynke that you are he that had batayll agaynst me yesterdaye, and that sholde haue retorned agayne to day. And he that hathe conquered me is the same that in the palays of ye duke Sauary keste me agaynste the erthe. It is true sayd valentyne, that is well knowen of you, the thynge is verytable I wyll

Now I shall tel you one thinge sayd the grene knyght the whiche I praye you to accomplysshe Sende me this knyghte yt hathe conquered me to yonder grete tree, and yf he maye take awaye the shelde that hangeth there, I shall knowe well yf it be he that shall conquere me, for of none other I maye not be ouercomen in no batayll. Than valentyne made sygne vnto Orson that he sholde go towarde the tree for to fetche the shelde that hanged there. Orson wente theder, and also soone as he came to the shelde he stratched for the his arme and the shelde lepte in to his hande, the whiche he brought to the grene knyght. And whan he sawe that Orson had brought the shelde frome the tree without enforcynge of hym, he knewe that it was he yt was predestyned for to conquere hym, he cast hym selfe to ye erthe & wolde haue kyssed his fete, but Orson was wyse and well taught by the sygnes of valentyn and wolde not let hym, but toke him by ye armes and lyfte hym vp. Alas sayd the grene knight Iought well to do you honoure and reuerence, more than to ony man on lyue for I knowe well that of all hardy and valyaunt knyghtes you ought to bere the name & fame. And amonge the other I afferine you and let you wyte that he that hathe conquered me is the moost hardyest and valyaū

And that this is true I maye proue it you by my syster Clerimonde. For she hathe a heed of brasse that telleth and declareth vnto her the aduentures and fortunes that to her and al them of her generacyon may happen and befall. And y• same heed shal endure vnto the tyme yt the moost

Ye nede not to demaunde of the grete noyse and the grete solace and the grete Ioye that was made of lytell and greate in the cyte of Acquytayne. And the duke Sauarye wyth all hys baronnage receyued them in grete tryumphe wythoute

Lordes wel ought you to bere honoure and reuerence vnto this Knighte that hathe cōquered me by force of armes. And knowe certainly yt this man is a kynges sonne and a Quenes, and he neuer souked no woman in his life for if it were not soo he shuld neuer haue had strength nor nuyssaunce for to haue vaynquysshed me, for so it was sayde by the head of brasse that my sister Clerymonde hathe in her cham bre.

In ioye and solace passed that daye tyll the nyght came that it was tyme to go to reste. The duke of Acquytayne dyde withdrawe hym in to his chambre for to rest hym. And euery body wente in to theyr chambres as they were ordeyned. Ualentyne and Orson wente in to a fayre chambre that was apparaylled of them, & wente to reste in o ryche bedde bothe Orson and he for that nyght. And whan it came towarde mydnyght by the wyll of god almyghty a aū
                  gell appered vnto Ualentyne and sayd to hym. Ualentyne knowe that god sendeth the worde by me that to morowe in the mornynge thou departe out of this lōd

and bede with the Orson by whome the grene knyghte hathe ben cōquered. And without soiournynge or delaye go vnto the castell of Ferragus, and there thou shalt fynde the fayre lady Clery
                     •
                  onde by whome thou shall knowe of what lynnage thou art extraught, & of what fader, thou was engendred, and of what moder thou was borne and chylded. And this I commaunde the in ye name of god that or euer thy felowe wedde the fayre fezonne thou perfourme this vyage. Of this vysyon valentyne was in grete thought, and in grete melancoly, and so passed the nyght vnto the tyme that it was clere daye without takynge ony reste. And whan ye day was comen he made Orson foryse, and wente into the plalays where as the grene knyght was with ye other barons and knyghtes abydynge the good duke Sauary, So it was not longe after that the duke entred in to ye halle. And also soone as he was entred ye grene knyght toke the wordes in saluynge hym with all due reuerence and sayd to hym. Free duke it is true and certayne yt within the terme assygned bytwene vs two I haue ben vaynquysshed, for the whiche thynge I haue none occasyon nor ryghte to aske youre doughter ony thynge, but at this houre I quyte her, and wyll leue your lande in reste and peas as I haue promysed in acquytaine of myn othe. And I praye you that ye make me haue the sacrament of baptym, to the ende that I maye be to god more agreable. Knyght sayd the duke wel haue you spoken, and to your requeste wyl I obeye in euery thynge for at this presente houre you shal be baptized The noble duke cōmaūded yt they sholde make a preest to come and baptyze the grene knyghte. Whan it came that he was at the fonte for to receyue baptim. Ualentyne

that was there presente spake before them all and sayd in this maner. Lordes the whiche be here assembled yf it please the valyaunt duke for to gyue me a gifte, that is that I praye hym that this same knyght be named Pepyn, for it is the propre name of the noble & valyaunt kynge of Fraunce that hathe nourysshed me ryght swetely, and that aboue all prynces is the moost puyssaunt and hardy, for the whiche I desyre that this knyght maye bere the name. To the demaunde of Ualentyne dyde consente & accorde al they that were there presente. And at the requeste of Ualentyne he was called Pepyn, the whiche name he bare frome that houre vnto the laste ende of his dayes. And after that he was baptyzed the duke of Acquytayne made Ualentyne and Orson come for to wedde his doughter the fayre Fezō
                  ne. But valentyne sayd to hym in maner of excusacion that bothe he and Orson had vowed and promysed for to go vnto Iherusalem afore they dyde ony other thinge, after that they hadde conquered the grene knyght. And vnder the vmbre of this excusacyon the duke gaue them leue by this condycon that Orson sholde swere and promyse for to retorne in to Acquytayne after yt he sholde haue accomplyshed and perfourmed his vyage, and that also soone as he sholde be retorned that he sholde take his doughter Fezonne vnto wyfe. And valentyne and Orson swore that they sholde do so, & thā he vttred it them Ioyously. And the grene knyght at y• same houre toke leue of the duke of Acquytayne for to go in to Fraunce to the kynge Pepyn and yelde him in acquytayne of his promyse. And valentyne before his departynge asked him ye rynge yt he had promysed him & he gaue it hi saynge. Who yt bereth it on hi maye not

be drowned, nor by salse Iugement condampned. Ualentyn toke the rynge & put it on his fynger. And than Orson and he toke leue for to acheue theyr vyage. And the grene knyght toke leue for to go in to Fraunce. So departed the thre knyghtes out of Acquytayne and toke theyr wayes towarde theyr Iourneys. Ualentyne and Orson mounted vpō the see, and with strength of saylles anone they hadde gone a grete waye, for the see was peasyble and the wynde agreable. They demaū
                  ded the maryners the waye for to drawe towarde the castell of Ferragus the gyaunt. And the maryuers shewed them, for they knewe it well bycause yt for to passe that passage it was of custome for to paye a trybute. Now is valentyne and Orson vpon the see that desyreth strongly for to fynde the castell of Ferragus. And the grene knyght rydeth thorughte the countree towarde the realme of Fraunce for to yelde him vnto the knyge. But or yt he arryued before the kynge Pepyn Blandymayn the squyer of the Empresse Bellyssant of who me I haue made mencyon before, that was mette by Ualentyne in the habyte of a pylgrym, salued the good kynge Pepyn in grete honoure & reuerence. And whan yt kynge Pepyn sawe him in suche habyte, & with so story sshed a berde, hedemaunded hym yf he came from the holy sepulcre or of what vyage he was pylgrym. Free kynge sayd Blandymayn a pylgrym am I not, but for to encheue more surely myn enterpryse I haue put my selfe in the habyte of a pylgrym. And knowe that I am messenger of a hyghe and puyssaunt lady that by treason hathe bendeiecte from her countree, and put pyteously in exyle. Alas syr the lady that I speke to you of is your syster, that is to wyte Bellyssant the free lady,

the whiche hath bene chaced shamefully awaye by the Emperoure Alexander, and lyueth in great pouerte & calamyte for defaulte of succoure. well haue you your harte harde when that for her deliueraunce ye will not employe you none other wyse.
            
            
               ¶ Howe kyng Pepyn hadde knowledge that valentine and Orson were his neuewes by Blandimayn and the grene knight that came and yelded him to the king as he had promysed valentyne. Cap. xxv.
               
               WHen kyng Pepyn hearde speake of his Syster, he began for to syghe hartely, and asked hym where she was. Syr sayde Blandymayn, I know the

truthe but I haue promysed her that I shall no body ensygne to the place where she is. But and ye be in doubte of her loyalte. I shal bring you a man that wil fyght for her quarell. Alas sayd the kyng I haue seene probacion ynough of her loyalte by the false Archebysshop that the marchaunce ouercame. I haue made her to be sought long tyme, but I can haue no tydynges of her in no maner. And that whiche greueth my harte moste, is that my syster Bellyssant was great with childe whē she was expulsed from the Emperour. And I wote not what chylde she hath borne, nor also howe she escaped that great daunger, for I knowe well that she hath not had suche helpe at her nede as vnto her apperteyned. Syr said Blandimayn for to speake of this matter. knowe that my lady Bellyssant your syster, felte the paynes of chylding in the forest of Orleaunce. And when the euyll had taken her, she sente me vnto a vyllage there besyde, for to fetche her a woman for to helpe and sucoure her. Then I made the moste dyligence that was possible for me, but or euer I was retourned the noble lady had delyuered two fayre sonnes, of the whiche a wylde beere muche furiously bare away one of the children into the wodde, in suche maner that the Empresse Bellyssant after her power wende for to haue saued and sucouredit, but she wiste not where it became, she had folowed so long that I founde her lying vpon the grasse in a swowne piteously aourned, the whiche semed better dead then on lyue. I tooke her vp betwene myne armes and comforted her as wel as I myght. And when she was come to herselfe and that she myght speake in syghyng muche pyteously she recounted vnto me the maner howe she had lost her childe

by the wylde beaste, and howe she had lefte the other vnder a tree. And when I vnderstode those wordes I ledde her vnto the tree whereas I had left her, and there doubled her sorowe, for she founde not the other chylde that she had lefte there. And thus were the two children of your syster loste in the foreste. And other tydynges knowe I not. And if you doubte you of this thynge for to haue the more greater knowledge knowe syr that I am Blandymayn that was geuen all alone for to conduyte your syster Bellissant, when she was sent in exile by the Emperoure Alexander. Alas Blandymayn sayde the kinge youre woordes geueth me distresse and displeasaunce when that I maye not knowe the place where as my Syster is, nor of her twoo chyldren haue certayne knowledge, but sythe that I can knowe none other thynge tell me if that it be long ago sythe that she was delyuered within the forest of the twoo chyldren. Syr sayd Blandymayn it was vpon the propre daye that you mette me in the forest of Orleaunce, and that I tolde you the pyteous tydynges of the exyle and vytuperable blame of my lady Bellyssant your syster. As the kyng Pepyn vnderstode these wordes of Blandymayn, he was ryght pensyfe in his courage. And euen so as he was in that thought he be thought hym of Ualentyne that he founde in the forest that same daie, and on Orson that had bene conquered by him in that same wodde. For this thing he was in great melancoly. And when he had al considered he knew by the sayinges of Blandimain that they were sonnes of his syster Bellissant. He sent for the quene Berth his wife & dyuerse other lordes and ladyes of his courte for to tell and declare it theim. Alas lordes sayd he I haue holden and

nouryshed longe tyme in my house as poore chyldren and vnpu
                     •
                  uayed, they that be sonnes to an Emperour and an Empresse, and my propre neuewes, that is vnlentine that I founde in the forest of Orleaunce, that was by my syster Bellyssant in the tyme of her misfor tune chylded within the wodde. And I let you to wyte that Orson the sauage that hath ben conquered by valentyne as I may vnderstand is his propre brother naturall, and they both are sonnes vnto the Emperoure of Grece. ¶ Of these tidinges was the quene Berthe muche ioyous, and all the lordes barons and knightes of the court. There was present the two enemies mor tal of Ualentine, that is to wyte Haufray and Henty, that with semblaunt made tyght ioyous chere, but at their hartes and courages they were tryste and sorowful. For aboue al thi
                     •
                  ges they desyred the death of the noble Ualentyne, for and to the ende that with Charlemayn their lytell brother they might do their wil disordinate, to whome they were muche contrary as you shall heare afterwarde recounted. Now was Blandy main right sore abashed when he harde the kyng speke thus of the dedes of the twoo chyldren, and demaunded hym. Syr know you in what lande these two children may be founde that you make mencion of. Frende sayd the kyng I haue nouryshed one in my house right longe, in suche maner that he is become great haroye and stronge, and hath conquered the other that lyued in the forest of Orleaunce as a beaste, and dyd
                     •
                  e greate dammage in the countrey aboute. And after that he had conquered hym, and that they hadde bene longe in my courte, they departed from me, and toke leue of me for to go in to Acquytayne to fyght with a hardy and a

valyaunt champyon that the grene knight maketh hī to be called. And syth theyr departynge I myght neuer haue tydynges of them. Syr sayd Blandymayn after that the whyche you tell me I let you wyte that I mette the two chyldren besyde the cyte of Acquytayne, wherfore I am ryght dyspleasaunt that I myght not know them, for of all my dolours I sholde haue had than alegement. Of this mater they deuysed longe tyme. And after these thynges the king commaunded that Blandymayn shuld be fested and serued honourablye in all thyngs that was necessary for hym. Than was Blā
                  dymayn taken by the officers of the palays and was ledde amonge the barons and knyghtes of hys courte, the whiche receiued him in grete honoure and reuerēce in festynge hym. Nowe it happened that on that same daye the grene knyghte that I haue made mencyon of before arryued at the courte of kinge Pepin that was at Parys. And soone as he was dyscended he went into the halle ryall, in the whyche kynge Pepyn was with his batous & knyghts muche notable. He salued the king right reuerentlye. And whan the kinge sawe hym armed wyth gre
                     •
                  e armour he meruaylled muche and demaunded hym before all his barons & knights. Tell vs whome you are and also what is the cause of your commynge hether and wherefore you 
                     •

Noble and honourable kyng sayde the grene knyght knowe that I am extraught out of sarazyns londe, and borne, and of a fader sarazyn I am engendred, and of a moder painime I haue bene childed, So it is true that for to haue to wife the doughter of ye duke of Acquitaine named Fezonne I haue by a whole yere holden the londe of the duke in my subgeccyon.

And haue doone so muche that at the laste I dyd gyue hym syx monethes of trewes, by such a couenant that yt he gaue me not a knyght that by force of armes myghte conquere me duryng that same tyme that I shold haue his Doughter Fezonne vnto wyfe. And in case that I were conquered and vainquisshed I shold make myne host to departe out of his countree wythoute 
                     •
                  armynge or hurtynge it. Now I haue ben ryght longe before the cyte of Acquitaine in abidinge euery day batayll, so there came to me many valyaunt knightes of dyuers countrees and regeons, the whiche I haue put al to death and hanged on a trē
                  ▪ saue alonely two worthy knyghtes wherof the one is named Ualentine and the other Orson, that same Ualentine fought wit me the space of a hole day, and we dyd so many feates of armes bytwene vs twayne that the nyght constray ned vs to leue and depart as wery and trauaylled.
               And whan it came on thee moro we that thee battayle sholde haue begonne agayne bytwene vs twayne, his felowe Orson armed with his propreharneis, entred in to the felde for to fight with me, wening to me that it had ben Ualentine. And whan that same Orsō was entred into the fielde muche fierslye he made me sygne of dyffyaunce. Than I lepte out agaynst hym, but littell auailed my strengthe, for I abode not longe or that I was vainquished by hym. And he woulde haue taken my lyfe from me yf Ualentyne had not come rennynge vnto vs, whyche made meswere to receiue bap

                  ym and byleue in Ihesu Christ, and to submit my life entirely vnto your commaundement and ordenaunce. And therfore in acquitinge my faythe and promyse by the knyghte Ualentine I am comen to yealde me vnto

you, as to hym that may do with me your plesure, and to whom after God apperteyneth to approch my dethe or to prolong my lyfe. Not for that my redoubted lord I yelde me before your maiestye ryal in demaundynge and trustynge to haue grace for the honoure of that same god that I haue taken the byleue of, for know that I am crystened and byleue in Ihesu Christe, and frome hens forthe wyl obserue it wyth true mind. And whan I was baptysed at the holy font stoone, in the honoure of your hygh and puy ssaunte name I was called Pepyn, and Pepyn I am called▪ whan the kynge vnderstode the wordes of the grene knyght he answered him swetely before all the barons and knyghtes sayenge. Welcome be you vnto vs. for of youre comynge we be tyghte Ioyous more than of onye other thynge. Make good chere for the loue of hym that sente you to vs, for I assure you of your lyfe. And yet I tell you before all that within short tyme I shal gyue you in my realme grete londes & possessyons if that it plese you to abyde in my seruice. But tell vs where the two knyghtes is that hathe conquered you. Syr said the grene knyghte I lefte them in the cyte of Acquytayne with the duke Sauary the whiche holdeth them more deater then all the other of hys court. By the tidinges of Blandimayn and by the grene knighte kinge Pepin hadde tidinges of his sister and of his two neue wes▪ the which she chileded in the foreste of Orleaunce. Wherefore he promised God that he shuld go into grece for to tell themperoure this tidinges, and for to make his sister to bee sought in such maner that she myght be found in some place, for aboue all creatures hee desyred ryghte ardantly to se his sister Bellissant that was sogracious▪

                  IN that same tyme that kyng Pepyn had rydynges of his syster Bellyssant, he made redy his hoost without delay and departed frō Parys for to go to Constantinoble towarde the Emperoure of Grece for to beare hym tydynges of his syster Bellyssant as you haue heard. The kynge made suche diligence that within short time he arriued at Rome. There he was receyued of the Pope with great honoure, for of the christē fayth he was the chief defendoure. He dyned that daye with the pope in his palays apostolyke the which tolde him tydinges of the Soudan that had besyeged the cytie of Constantynoble. And thus as they spake and deuysed of that matter there arryued a knyght of Grece the whiche after that he had salued the pope and the kynge and all the assista

                  ein the christen faithe againste the paynims. whan the pope heard the kyng Pepyn speke so and knewe his courage he thanked him with all his hert, and sayd to him. Fre king right thristen of god be thou blyssed, for of al other kynges thou arte the most puyssaunt in wordde and dede, and syth that you wyll vndertake such a thinge, I shall make so greate nombre of Romayns come hether for to accompany you, yt you maye surely arryue in grece against the infydeles and enemyes of the fayth. The pope in that same time of al the londe Romayne assembled so great a nombre of folke that it was meruayll, & made to ctye the croysee, that is to knowe that all that wolde go in that batayll in the honoure of the passyon of Jhesu christ, and were a crosse takynge of the pope his blessinge, shuld haue pardon of al their sinnes. In the cyte of Rome wt in a lyttell tyme assembled greate multitude of people, for to go ouer the see with the king Pepin. And the pope at their departing gaue them his blessinge, and absolucion of al their sinnes. Thus the king Pepin toke leue of the pope and of the cardinalles in recommaundinge him vnto the Praiers of holy chyrche. And wyth thirty thousande Romaines beside his owne hooste he mounted vpon the sea. And so muche the time was agreable vnto him that with in fewe daies he came and ariued at Constantinoble. And there he sawe that the soudan Moradyn hadde besyeged it on al sydes. And this soudan had brought with him. xx. knigs the whithe for to distroy christen dome with two hundred thou

sande paynyms had passed the sea. And so muche was this soudan fered and redoubted for his puyssaune, yt the Emperoure of Grece with dyuers other christians accompanied hadde withdrawen hym into Constantinoble, and so well he kepte the cytie that it myghte not be taken of the paynym. Alwayes in his courage he bewaylled his wyfe Bellyssant, and he bethought of the shame that he hadde delyuered her to without cause, & thought well within his sorowful harte that she was decessed out of this worlde for it was twenty yere past syth he harde any tydinges of her, but anone he shall heresome by kyng Pepyn that toweth so much vpon ye sea that within two myle of Constantynoble he is arriued and descended. And made his tentes and pauilions to be pyght vp in the fielde, and made his foolke to be put in right faire ordinaunce. Then was the cutrouts and tyders of the soudan. Moradyn muche agast, that in great diligence retourned towarde his pauilion and said to hym as men afrayed and full of fere.

Holde your peace sayd the Soudan & of them haue no drede, for it is not possyble that out of the Empyre of Rome there be descended so many folke we be puyssaunt ynough for to abyde then in batayll renged. For I haue hope that within short time I shall put in my subiection both Rome and Fraunce. ¶ He cōmaunded the capitaines to put his hoost in point for to receyue them. when the morowe was come, the king made ready his hoost for to assayle the paynims fiersly

Than kinge Pepyn sent a lettre secretely into the cyty to the Emperoure whythe specified to him his comming for to socourhym. And that he shold make al his men be armed through the cite in al diligence, and that they sholde yssue out vpon the painims and sarazyns for at that day they shuld be socoured by the Romaines and Frenshmen. The Emperoure was much Joious of the comming of king Pepin, and after the tenour of the letter made his hooste too be assembled and armed and after yssued oute of the cyte of Constantynoble for to go agaynst the paynyms and sarazyns that aboode batayll.

               ¶ Howe the grene knyght Justed against two Sarazins and howe he slewe the one and the other fledde, & howe kyng Pepyn with his hoost was enclosed within Constantinoble. Cap. xxvii.
               
                  
               
               
                  WHen the two sarazing had said so their an against the grene knyght, and he hit one of them so that he neuer arose, & the other fled sore wounded. Well sawe kyng Pepyn that valiaunt dede. Then he made to assayll the Soudan Moradyns hoost. And there Myllon dangler slewe the kyng of Acquyle at one strooke, and thre more or euer he rested. And he dyd so great dedes

of of armes that the soudan Moradin apperceiued him, so he cried 
                     〈◊〉
                   highe to his folke that they shoulde assaile Myllon Dangler that made so greate slaughter of sarazins. At the commaundement of the Soudan Millon dangler was assayled on all sydes by the paynyms & sarazyns. And he was put in suche subiection that they cut of one of his horses thyes, by the which he was constrayned to fall vnto the earth, & at that tyme had bene taken or slayne if the grene knight hadde not bene that maugte the sarazins put himselfe ī the prese and slewe & smote down so many that he approched vnto Myllon dangler and gaue him a horse and mounted him vpon him. At that houre did the grene knyght and Myllon dangler so great dedes of armes agaynste the paynyms that it should be to great a thyng to recounte it, for all that founde themselfe before them neuer went out of that place. Great was the battayll and endured long. Kyng Pepyn and his men that daye made great slaughter of the paynims. But not withstanding their hardynes they should haue lost the fyelde if the Emperoure of grece had not bene, that with all his hoost valyauntly accompanied assayled the paynims on the other syde ryght hardely, and put great nombre to death well knewe the kyng that the Emperoure didde greate deades of armes. Then he toke force and courage, & assembled his men agayne▪ and entred into the battayll more ardauntly then before, & thus the paynims were assayied on both sydes. And as soone as the kyng sawe the Emperoure he sayde vnto hym. ¶ Free prince now shewe your selfe valiaunt, for to daye by me you shall haue tydynges of youre wyfe Bellyssant. At these wordes the Emperoure was ioyous and double hys

courage. And cryed Constantynoble to his men, in promysyng them great gyftes if they bate them valiaunt. At these wordes he entted into the batayl with so marueilous a courage that he was to hardy that abode him And kyng Pepyn and the grene knight entred in on the other syde in smytyng vpon the paynyms so impetuously, that wheresoeuer they passed they made a large waye thorough the prowesse of the grene knyght. Wel wende the Soudan Moradyn to haue knowen hym that behelde his armes, for he was of a hygh lynage because that he was brother vnto Ferragus. But because that he knewe that the grene knyght was a paynim he would neuer haue thought that he had bene come on that syde. Nowe was the paynyms and Saraszyns at that houre put in such necessite that they wende neuer to haue escaped death, and toke the flyght. And then the kyng of S

When the Soudan sawe that the christen men were entred, he made too assyege the cytie ryght nece. And there was soo great nombre of paynyms about the cytie vpon euery syde that the emperoure and the kyng▪ Pepyn myght not yssue out of it. ¶ Thus they abode long tyme in the subiection of

                  AFter that valentine and Orson hadde long tyme abyden vpon the hye Sea, they aduysed an yle in the whiche was a castell right stronge and puyssaunte, and full of greate beautie, that same Castell was all couered

with laten right clere and shynynge, and for the greate beaute of it Ualentine thought wel within him selfe yt it was that there as the greane knyghte had sente hym to for to fynde his syster Clerymonde. He wente anone thederwarde and dyscended at one of the portes of the Ile. And whan he was dyscended he enquyred and demaunded who ought that castell that was so faire and so ryche. And it was answered hym that the castel was in the kepynge of tho fayre Clerymonde syster vnto the gyaunte Ferragus, and that by a ryche sarazyn it was ed

And more ouer it was sayde vnto Ualentyne that within that same chambre there was a moche rych Pyller and excellente, vppon the whiche was a heade of brasse that of olde antiquite had bene composed muche subtyllye by Nygromancye of a Face, the whyche head was of suche nature that it gaue answer of al thynges that was asked it. And whan Ualentine vnderstoode the declar

                  cyon of the Castell, he was ryghte Ioyous in his heart, for he thought wel that it was the place yt the grene knyghte had tolde hym that he shoulde fynde hys syster in, that was so gretely commended aboue all other of lytel and grete for her great beaute. He demaū
                  ded no ferder for the for that presente time, but put hym vppon the waye wyth Orson for to goo into that same castel and so muche they haue gone that they are comen before the gate for to entre in, but they did fynde. x. knyghtes stronge and hardye there that dyd keepe the gate nyght and daye. And whan they sawe Ualentyne and

Orson that wolde haue entred in they sayd to theym. Lordes with drawe you abacke, for within this castell entreth no body be he neuer of so hyghe a lygnage without the leue and lycence of a mayden to whome y• garde appertayneth, the whiche aboue all them of ye world is garnysshed with beaute. Frende sayd Ualentyne go towarde the mayden and demaūde her yf it be her pleasure to gyue me entre in to her castel. Than the porter mounted vpon hye, & entred in to the chambre where as the fayre Clerymonde was. After he set his knee on the grounde and sayd to her. Lady before the gate of your castell in two men that wolde entre, and they seme men of ryght fyers courage and full of grete pryde and it semeth by theyr maners that they are men of euyll courare & dede, and contrary to oure lawe. Nowe tell your wyl and answere to the gardes of the gate yt hathe sente me towarde you, yf it please you that they shall entre or not. Frende sayd the mayden dyscende adowne, and I wyll goo vnto a wyndome for to wytte what men they be, and make the gates for to be kepte well, for I wyll speke to them▪ The porter wente downe and sayd to his felowes that the gate sholde be well kepte, tyl that the lady were at the wyndowe so

And know that by none other manner ye maye entre into this castel saue alonely by one point that I shal tel you, that is that you take leue of the Seneshall of thys place the which I shal gyue you by suche a condicion that before or you entre you shall Just with him fiue or syxe strokes wyth a spere. Wherefore auyse you whether you loue better to goo fetche me certayne sygnes of one of my brederen, or doo as I haue tolde you. Ladye sayde Ualentyne make doo come your Seneshal, for I haue leauer fyght agaynste hym and wynne and deserue to entre into your castell, than I goo by prayers, requestes and flaterynges. Thus spake Ualentine vnto the fayre Clerimond that had hys courage so valyaunt and hardy / not withstondyng that he brought from the Grene Knyght certain signes by the ring of golde, that he loued better for too Iuste for to proue his bodye than for to shewe the rynge the which he should present vnto the fayre Clerimonde. And whan the Lady sawe the wyll and hardye courage wherwith he was repleate, from that same houre shee was espyred and taken wyth hys loue ryght ardauntly at the hart. Thanne in contynente she mounted in too the chambre where as the head of brasse was and sayd vnto it, what is that knight that hath so gre

for that answer was the fayre Clerymond for the loue of Ualentyne in grete thoughte.
            
            
               ¶ How as Ualentyne was before the castell speakynge to the gardes Clerymonde made her complaynte all alone of Ualentyne, and howe he Justed for the entre of the castell and wanne it. Ca. xxix.
               
               
                  WHen she had consydered by her self ye maitene and the fayre speche and hardynes of Ualentyne she was enbraced with his loue more thā of ony other that euer she had sene and sayd Ueray God what maye be befor aboue al lyuynge he is worthy to be loued, for he

I shall neuer take other than hym. whan the fayre clerymonde had sayd al these thynges and thought in her courage, she sente for the Seneshall and tolde hym the tydynges of the knyght that wolde entre into ye castel By my god sayd the Seneshall he dothe procurea grete folye, for he shall not entre without prouynge of his body agaynst myne. And yf he be soo hardy for to take batayll agaynst me I shall shewe him clerely before al yt for to haue your loue he is comen to late. Seneshall sayd the lady, sythe that ye wyll not gyue him lycence for to entre in to the castell go and arme you anone for I let you wyte that you shal haue batayll of hym, and I am in grete doubte that you shall repente you to late wherfore I counsayll you that ye put not youre body in this daunger. Lady sayd the Seneshall that was tyghte proude leue in peas suche wordes, for or euer yt he entre his body shall abye it. At these wordes the Seneshall departed▪ and wente to arme hym, and after moū
                  ted on horsbacke. And whan he was mounted be yssued out of the gate with a grete spere in his hande well heded. And the lady was at the wyudowe for to beholde the batayll of the two champyons. Whan Ualentyne sawe the Seneshall come towarde hym with afyer se courage, he couched his spere and smote his hors with the sporres. Than they encountred the one the other so euen that bothe theyr speres flewe in peces. After they toke newe speres incontynnente, and met sotyersly togyder that bothe champyons and horses fell vnto the erthe, but anone Ualentynes hors recouered that was fyetse and stronge without settynge his mayster on the grounde. And whan the noble knyght valentyne was

The Seneshall was moche Joyous and pray see gretely the curtey sye of Ualentyne, so he mounted on his hors and after toke a spere, and came agaynst Ualentyne ryght impetuously, But the noble valentine that at yt tyme coude playe well with a spere gaue hym so grete a stroke that he smote of his helme from his heed, and made hors and man fall vnto the erthe. And whan he sawe hym selfe smyten downe and in so greate daunger he sayd vnto Ualentyne.
               Knyght I can not tel of whēs you are nor of what coū
                  tree, but neuer the dayes of my lyfe founde I a knyght that was so valyaūt as you. I wyll yelde me vnto you and shallet you entre in to the castel at your owne pleasure the whiche is soo fayre and sumptuous on suche a condycyon that without my leue you shal not speke vnto the fayre Clerymonde by no manere. By my faythe sayd valentyne you are full of grete folye to saye suche wordes, for specyally for the loue of her haue I passed the see, and am comen this waye, and how well that I neuer sawe her, yet am I enamoured on her more than on ony other lady. And I let you wytte yt I shall neuer departe from hens tyll that I haue spoken with her and with ye heed of brasse at my pleasure. Thus as Ualentyne and the Seneshall spake togyder the fayre Clerymonde that was at ye wyndowe meruaylled, moche of the graciousnes of valentyne. Alas sayd she vnto her maydens that were with her se how this Seneshall is folys she for to fyght with so valyaunt a knyght whiche myght haue slayne hym longe ago yf his gentylnes

had not refrayned hym. Daughters by the god almyghty I meruayle me moche what he may be that hathe so greate desyre for to entre in to my stronge and puyssaunt castell. In ryght grete thought was the noble lady Clerymonde, and sayd that she wolde haue ones that knyghte for her loue. For euer the more that she sawe hym the more was her loue fured vpon hym▪ Whan valentyn sawe the grete pryde of the Seneshal and his grete ouerweninge he smote his hors with the sporres and gaue hym so grete a stroke in the myddes of his body that he smote hym through the lyuer & the longes and felled hym downe deed to the erthe, wherof the gracious lady Clerymonde was ryght Joyous Than she cōmaunded the porters for to open the gates & that Ualentyne sholde be brought vnto her in to her halle prepayred. The porters dyde the commaundement of the lady Clerymonde, and ledde towarde her the noble valentyne and Orson his broder. And whan the excellente lady Clerymonde sawe Ualentyne she wente agaynst hym & sayd to hym. Knyght well be ye comen for I sawe neuer so valyaunt nor so hardy a knyght entre in to my castell; well shewe you by your dedes that you are extraught oute of a gentyll bloode Lady sayde Ualentyne knowe that by my propre name I am called Ualentyne and am a poore aduenturer that of my generacyon and lygnage had neuer knowlege and yet I sawe, neuer the fader by whome I was engendred nor the moder that bare me, nor also dyde my felowe yt you se here, for he was nourysshed in a forest lyke a wilde beest, where as I conquered him with ye swerde moche valyauntly. And knowe for a certaynte that he neuer spake noo more than you se him doo at this tyme,

Now haue I gone so moche for to haue knowledge of my frendes that I haue passed ye see for to come hether for the loue of your grete beaute.
            
            
               ¶ How valentyne shewed the rynge vnto Clerymonde that her broder the grene knyght haddde gyuen him and how he spake vnto the head of brasse, whiche tolde hym all his generacyon. Capitulo. xxx
               
               
                  
                  IN sayinge those wordes Ualentyne drew out the rynge that the grene knyghte hadde gyuen hym, and in smylynge gaue it vnto the fayre Clerymonde, the whiche incontynent knewe it well. And thanne she sayde vnto Ualentine. Knyghte fayre syr yf you hadde shewed me that rynge whan you arryued before my Gates, wythoute abydynge onye Iustes or putting your bodye in daunger, at that same houre you shoulde haue entred into my castell wythout contradiccion. But you haue shewed the greate noblenes that is in you, whan that by your hardynes you haue loued better to enter in to mi castel and come toward me than to seke onye other meanes. Soone after that Ualentyne and the fayre Clerimonde had spoken thus togyder the tables were spredde and the Mayden sette. And Ualentine was set before her that toke none other solace nor plesure saue alonely to behold her that was set before him. Alas veray God sayd Ualentine in hys courage please it you to take my heart out of thys dolorous dystresse shortly, which and for the loue of thys lady so profoundlye wounded at the harte that neuer the daies of my life I was in such melancoly. Alas god she is so muche garnyshed wyth beaute, and so full of grete bounte, the eyen grene in laughynge stedfaste, the foreheade cleare and polyshed, and the face ruddye. And all the other membres of her body by ryght measure naturally composed. Now am I soo ardauntly taken wyth her loue that the death shuld be more agreable vnto me than for to fayll too perfourme and accomplysshe, this thinge. In thys manner complayned the noble knyght Ualentine for the loue of the excellent Clerymonde.
               ¶ And she vppon the other syde in beholdyng hym loste

bothe maners and countenaunce. In this grete melancoly the moost honestly that they might kepe their countenaunces passed the knyght & the lady the dynner. And whan the tables were taken vp Clerymonde toke Ualentyne by the hande and sayde to hym. Frende so moche haue you doone that you haue deserued for to entre into my secrete chambre, where as you shall see the heade of brasse, the whyche of your lygnage shall tell you good and certayne tydynges. Nowe come your waye wyth me and brynge your felow with you, for I haue a grete desyre to heare the answere that shall be gyuen you by the heade of brasse. The noble knyght Ualentyne was muche Ioyous whan he hearde the amerous lady Clerimonde speke so. They yssued out of the halle and wende towarde the chambre where as the heade of brasse was rychlye aourned. And anone as they were at the doore for to haue entred in, they found on the one syde a meruayllous, ferefull and a stronge vyllayne ryghte greate and croked, that bare a clubbe of yron vpon his necke, the which was right heauye. The which villaine semed to be rebell and full of great outrage. And on the other syde of the dore was a lyon right great fierse & proud. These twayne were ordeyned at all ceasones for to defend and kepe that none should entre into the chambre wythoute the ladies leue, and without fightinge wyth the vyllayn and the lyon. And whan Ualentine apperceiued the villa
                     •
                   and the lion that dressed them against theym for to defende the dore. He demaunded the fayre Clerymonde what suche thinges signified and woulde say. Lordes sayd Clerymonde the set wayne that you se here are for to kepe the doore and there inaye none enter withoute fightynge wyth them▪ wherby dyuers beno

                  er. And to the regarde of the lyon he is of suche a nature that he wyl neuer doo a kings son harmnor dommage. Lady sayd Ualentine I canne not tell what shall happen, but at auenture I shal put me in the garde of God hauyng confydence to ouer come the lyon. Than he aproched him to the proud beaste and by strength of armes enbraced him about the bodye, but also soone as he smelled Ualentines cloothes and fleshe he let hym goo and was curteis and humble withoute doynge hym hurte or dommage. And Orson was on the other syde that assaylled the vyllayn and or euer he myght lyfte vp his clubbe of yron he tooke hym by the mydle so rudely that he threwe hym agaynst the walle, and than toke his clubbe from him and gaue him so great a stroke that he felled hym to the earth in suche facyon that yf it hadde not ben the fayre Clerymond he would haue slayne the villayne in the place. And thus was the vyllayne vaynquysshed & the Lyō by the two knyghtes. After the gate was opened and they entred in to the chambre that wyth all rychesse mondayn was dressed.

Ualentyne opened the amarye and behelde the heed in coniurynge it for to tell him the trouthe of his estate & natyuyte. Than spake the heed so hye and so clere that euery body herde it and sayd to hym. Knyght of grete renowne I tel the that thou arte named valentine the inoost hardy and valyaunt that euer syth the worlde began entred here in, & arte that same to whome the fayre Clerymonde hathe ben gyuen, and ought to be, nor neuer shall she haue other than you.

& neuer syth was there by it ony worde spoken. Than Ualentyne that was rauysshed for Ioye came to Orson and in wepynge moche tenderly kyssed his mouthe And Orson on the other syde enbrased hym and called hym in castynge onte grete syghes anguysshous. Alas sayd Clerymonde to Ualentine Free curteyse knyght I oughte to be ryghte Ioyous of your comynge, for by you I am out of grete thought and melancolye, in the whiche by the space of ten yere I haue passed my tyme languysshynge in doloure, abydynge hym yt I oughte to be gyuen to. Now you are he I se it clerely, for by no ne other the heede of brasse sholde lese the speche. And syth that it is thus that by your comynge it hathe loste the speche. I gyue me and habandone me vnto you as to my parfyte loue, and to hym that by ryghte and reason I ought to be vttred and gyuen. And from hensforthe I promyse you and swere to you with herthe, body, and godes that I shal serue you loyally after my lytell puyssaunce & encheue your good pleasure. Lady sayd Ualentyne of your good wyll I thanke you hertely, it is well ryght and reason that I loue you aboue all the thynges of the worlde and holde dere, for frome before Acquytayne you were gyuen me by the grene knyght your broder, the whiche by the helpe of me & of my broder Orson was conquered and vaynquysshed, & whan it shall be your pleasure for to take the lawe and the bileue that the grene knyght hathe taken I am contente for to wedde you. That is for to wyte the lawe of Ihesu chryste withoute the whiche none can haue the Ioye eternall. Syr sayd the mayden suche thynge wyll I do gladly. For with all my courage I am redy and apparaylled to fulfyll your mynde & obeye to your commaū

Soo grete was the renowne of the knyght Ualentyn that al they of the countree aboute made grete Ioye, but the grete Ioye of Ualentine & the fayre Clerymonde was soone torned in to sorowe & dystresse by the false treason of her broder Ferragus▪ as it shal be declared vnto you here afterwarde.
            
            
               ¶ How by an enchauntour named Pacolet the giaunt Ferragus had tydynges of his syster and of Ualentyne. And of the answer that he gaue Pacolet. Ca. xxxi.
               
                  
               
               
                  
                  IN the castell of pleasaunce of the fayre lady Clerymonde was a dwerfe that she had nourysshed from his chyldhode & sette vnto the scole. That same dwerfe was called Pacolet He was full of grece wytte and vnderstondynge, the whiche at the scole of tollette had lerned so muche of the arte of Nygromancye that aboue all other he was perfyte, in suche manere that by enchauntemente he had made and composed a lytell hors of wodde, and in the heed there was artyfycyelly a pynne that was in suche wyse set, that euery tyme that he mounted vpon the horse for to goo somwhere, he torned the pynne towarde the place that he wolde go to, and anone he foū
                  de him in the place without harme or daunger, for the hors was of suche facyon that he wente thorughe the ayre more faster than ony byrde coude flee. That same Pacolet that had ben nourysshed in the castell of Clerymonde, all the daye he be helde and consydered the maners and facyons of ye noble Ualentyn. Than he thoughte that he wolde go in to Portyngale & recount vnto hym the enterpryse of Ualentyne and the manere of his comynge. He wente vnto his hors of wodde & mo

                  ted vpon hym, after he torned the pynne towarde Portyngale, and incontynent the hors of wodde mounted in to the ayre & so moche he wente that that same nyghte he arryued in Portyngale, and to the kynge Ferragus tolde the tydinges. whan Ferragus vnderstode the speche of Pacolet the enchauntoure he was moche angrye and sorowfull at his herte agaynste Ualentyne ye noble knyghte that sholde haue his syster Clerymonde and also agaynst her bicause she had gyuen her herte & her loue to a chrysten knyght for ye whiche he was sory,

And swore by his grete god that he wolde take vengeaunce on him, but before Pacolet he shewed not his furoure nor the wyll of his courage, for ye man that thynketh treason holdeth alwayes his mouthe secrete for to come the better vnto his entencyon. Ryght so dyde Ferragus that sayd vnto Pacolet the enchauntour. Frende retourne vnto my syster Clerymonde and saye vnto ye knyght that shall haue her in maryage yt I am ryght gladde of his comynge, and that I shall se hym ryght shortely accompanyed with my baronage to be at his weddynge. Syr sayd Pacolet I shall do gladly youre message, and than he moūted on his hors & was there in an instaunt. And whan he was before Clerymonde he sayd vnto her. Madame I come from Portyngale, and haue sene your broder Ferragus, the whiche is ryghte Ioyous of the noble Ualentyne that shal be your husbande, and knowe that with in shorte tyme he wyll se you in greate tryumphe to make your maryage. Ha Pacolet sayd the lady I wo

                  e neuer what shall happen but I fere me gretely that my broder thynke not some treason, for I knowe well that he wyll neuer loue noo knyght of Fraunce, nor man that holdeth the lawe of Ihesu chryste. And on y• other syde I am ryght dysple asaunt that I knewe not of thy goynge, for thou sholde haue enquyred after a chysten woman that of longe time hathe ben abydinge with my broder Ferragus wyfe in his castell.
            
            
               ¶ How Pocolet retorned in to Portyngale for to seke Bellyssant Ualentynes moder, and howe he sawe her in Ferragus castell. Capitulo. xxxii.
               
                  
                  
               
               
                  LAdy sayd Pacolet I shal besone retorned a gayne, 
                     •
                   to morowe before myddaye I shall brynge you tydynges. By god sayd Ualētyne that maye you not do without the arte of the enemye. Ualentyne sayd Clerymōdelet hym werke and do his crafte, for he is so well faughte that he wyll go more than a thousande myle on a daye whan Ualentyne knewe that Pacolet coude suche and arte he meruaylled moche. Than he called Orson and cut and toke awaye the threde that was vnder his tongue. And after ye it was out he began for to speke veray ryght and pleasaūtly, and that same houre recounted vnto them all his lyfe that he haddeledde in the forest. So they were herkenynge hym the moost parte of the

nyght. And on the moro we Pacolet found hym self in the halle before Ualentine and sayd to hym. Syr I come from Portyngale where as I haue seene your moder that is in good he
                     •
                  le. Frende sayd Ualentine thou arte welcome, for it is the thinge that I desyre mooste to here good tidinges of her and se her. Loue said Clerymonde take comforte to you, if my brother comme not hecher we shal go into Portyngale and se her there Ladye sayde Pacolet knowe for a certainte that your brother wyll be here shortiye, for so he dyd promyse me. Alas sayd the pleasaunce Ladye Clerymonde I am to sore a ferde in my hearte that my brother Ferragus do not some thinge whereby our ioyous enterpryse maye be tourned in to harde discomfort, for I haue drenied a dreme muche meruayilous which put
                     •
                  eth me in grete thought and fere. The night whan I shold haue taken my rest I dremed that I was in a great and a meruailous water profounde, in the which I should haue be drowned yf it had not bene a face that drew me out of the water. And than me thought I sawe a Gryffon yssue out of a cloude, the whiche with his nayles sharpe and longe tooke me and bare me soo farre that I wyste not where I was artyued. Ha my loue said Ualentine take no thoughte sor your dreame, for who that wolde byleue in dremes shoulde haue to much to suffre. It is true sayd the fayre lady Clerymonde but I can not kepe my selfe therfro. At these wordes the lady & Ualeutine entred into a fayre arbour that was garnyshed wt al maner of floures, and therin they were a grete while talkinge of their secreate loue. Nowe it happened that the same day Ferragus the traytour arriued there and whan the lady knewe that he was comen she wente to

warde hym for to welcom him. And he sayd to her moche swetely. My syster aboue all worldly creatures I hadde desyre for to se you. Nowe tell me I praye you whiche is the knyght that shal wedde you, fayre broder here may you sehy
                     •
                  n. Than valentyne approched and salue the one the other with grete reuerence. Knyghte sayd Ferragus ye be welcome in to these quarters for to wedde my syster Clerymonde. For ryght soo as my broder the grene knyght the whiche hathe sente you hether after that he hadde ben conquered by you dyde taken the fayth of Ihesu christe, euen so haue I my wyll and synguler desyre to receyue baptim and take youre byleue. Syr sayd Ualentyne of your wyll be Iesus thā
                  ked, for he for your redemptyon suffred dethe and passyon, without the whiche none can be saued. Alas Ualentyne thought well that the traytoure Ferragus had sayd those wordes by greate deuocyon, but vnder the shadowe of swete and fayre wordes he ymagyned mortall treason. And whan the gyaunt Feragus had sayd so Ualentyne sayd to hym. Syr it hathe ben tolde and recoūted vnto me that within your hous syth the space of twenty yere or there aboute you holde a christenwoman the whiche I desyre for to se with al my herte whiche is my moder, and is named Bellyssante syster vnto the kynge Pepyn, and wyfe vnto the Emperoure of Grece. By mahoune sayd Ferragus you say trouthe but to the ende that you be the better enfourmed of her you shall come in to Portyngale and se the lady. And whan you shall haue spoken to heryou maye knowe yf she be suche as you demaunde or not, grameryce sayd Ualentyne, than he lefte hym and sayd vnto his syster, the fayre Clerymonde in maner of good & perfyte loue.

My syster and inyne onelye esperaunce, I desyre aboue all thynges your honoure, and auauncemente, and am ryght Ioyous that you haue founde so valyaunt a knyght to your husbande and spouse, and for his greate valyauntnesse I wyll that you and he come with me into portyngale, to the ende that with the greater tryumph you maye be maryed togyder.
            
            
               ¶ Howe Ualentyne and Orson were betrayed by Ferragus, and howe he put them in an obscure prisō, wher as they made pyteous complayntes. Ca. xxxiii.
               
               
                  
                  WHan Ferragus had spoken so to his sister Clerimonde, he made his shippes and hys galees to be apparaylled, and his men for to mount vppon the sea. After he sent for Ualentine the which was ryght Ioyous for to goo into portyngale with his loue Clerymonde.
               For he wend wel that the gyaunt Ferragus ledde them ouer for to do them honoure / for he had promysed them that he wold be christened and al thei of his court, wher by Ualentine was betrayed and his broder Orson. For also soone as the cursed sarazyne was mounted vppon the sea, and that he had Ualentine in his subgecciō with in his shippe, he thoughte that he shoulde neuer escape his handes wythout death, but at the entre of the sea he made him fayre semblaunte, and by false worddes and promyses he made them come with hym, but whanne it came towarde midnighte that the two knyghtes were gone to reast them, the traytour Ferragus made them to be taken secretely in theyr beddes and be boūden surely, and made theyr eyen to be bended as man that were opēly condempned to death by faute crymynell. And whan the fayre Clerymonde sa we her louer Ualentine taken and bounden, she made so greate sorowe that hee had a harde harte that wepte not. Alas said she knight Ualentyne our Ioye and solace is soone torued into dolour and dystresse, you haue boughte my loue to deare, whan that for my sake you muste suffre death, I wolde that I had neuer bene borne for your sake, for in payne and in trauayll you haue conquered me, and in doole and in sorowe I shall be taken from you, to sore is the loue bought whan one muste suffre deathe for louynge trewlye wythoute to haue deserued it. Alas alas nowe

oughte I wel to syghe with my herte and tenderly wepe with myn eyen, whan it behoueth that for my loue the moost valyaunt, the moost hardy, and the moost noble of the worlde be delyuered vnto shameful dethe, ha
                     •
                   Ferragus my fayre broder to euyll do you werke. For of all the worlde you haue betrayed and deceyued the moost valyaunt knyght, and yf it be soo that he muste suffre dethe for me I shall neuer the dayes of my lyfe haue Ioye at my herte, but ye moost sonest that I may I shall procure my dethe by some waye. And I do you to wytte that yf you put the two knyghtes to dethe, ye shall haue ones a vyllaynous reproche, and therfore let them alone. For in purchasynge theyr dethe you can haue no prouffyte. And yf you wyll put them to dethe, make me be caste fyrste in to the see, for I wolde not lyue to se suche two valyaunt knyghtes dye before me with out hauynge deserued it. So moche was the lady Clerimonde smyten profoundly at herte with sorowe that at that same houre she wolde haue slayne herselfe, or lepte in to the see yf she had not ben letted. Than Ferragus her brober made her to be kepte by his barons, and cōmaunded the kepers that they sholde not let her speke one worde to the prysoners, and so abode Clerymonde in teres and pyteous syghes, and Ualentyne & Orson were bounde ryght faste by the sarazyns and paynyms. They reclaymed god moche deuoutely praynge hym that he wolde delyuer them out of that daunger.
               Alas sayd Ualentine nowe is fortune moche contrary to me and at my dede peruerse and dysloyall. Now haue I all my lyfe in payne and trauayll vsed my youthe for to seke and fynde the place that I was extraughte oute of, and the fader and moder that hathe broughte

me into this worlde, and now whan I am almoost at the ende of my doloure, in conuertynge it into Joye, & that of my dere moder ye I haue desyred so muche I hoped to haue had tydynges shortly, and certayne knowledge, and in thynkynge to haue ben assured to perfour me myn enterpryse, but in ye places dysloyall I am vnhappely comen and fallen into the handes of myn enemyes that of my lyfe are enuyous and desyreth my dethe. Alas my fayre broder Orson well is our thoughte and our entencyon in a shorte time chaunged and reuer▪ sed for we shall neuer se frendes nor kynnesmen. In this wyse complayned Ualentine & Orson in lykewyse and the sarazyns demeaned grete Ioye, and so moche they rowed vpon the see that they arryued in Portyngale at the castell of Ferragus. And also soone as ye empresse Bellyssant herde saye that Ferragus had broughte with hym two christen men prisoners she lepte oute of her chambre for to go se them. Whan she sawe valen tyne and Orson the whiche she knewe not she demaunded them. Chyldren of what countree be you & in what londe were you borne. Lady sayd valentyne we be of ye countre of Fraunce and borne besyde Parys. Also sone as Ferragus sawe the Empresse Bellyssāt that spake vnto the chyldren, he sayd vnto her fyersly, lady leue me this language, for I shall make them dye in my prison with grete sorowe but yf they byleue in mahoune, He called the gayler and cōmaunded hym to put ye two prysoners in the moost depest pryson and ye moost derkeste, & that they sholde haue none other meet nor drynke but brede and water. There was ye cursed sarazins that with grete staues and with theyr 
                     •
                  ystes smote vppon the two chyldren without hauynge ony pyte more

                  ge god mercy, and in praynge him that he wolde forgyue thē theyr synnes, for they neuer wende to haue comen oute of that place. And after that Ferragus hadde thus enprysoned Uale
                     •
                  tyne and Orson, he mounted vp into his palais, and made to be brought before hym the fayre Clerymonde that wepte so pyteously that with ye teres that yssued out of her eyen all her face was be wepte. My syster said Ferragus leue your wepinge & chaū

To whome haue you your herte varyable and wyll of a woman whan you wyll loue him yt hathe shewed himselfe mortal enemye of your broder the grene knyghte, well appertayneth you to haue a man more worthy and of more hygher lygnage.

And therfore forgete the two chrysten Frēshmen, and haue no more truste on them, for I shal make them dye and be hanged by the necke. Broder said Clerymonde it behoueth me to obeye vnto your commaundement for one muste for

the fayre Clerimonde in sayinge to her. My Syster you be ryght welcome hether, for I hadde ryght greate desyre for to se you. Lady sayd Clerimonde I thancke you a hondred tymes, but knowe that I am ryghte sorowful and dyspleasaunt of two christen knights the whiche my broder Ferragus vnder the vmbre of surenes and loyalte hathe made to passe the sea, and after hathe put them into an obscare prysone vyle and abhomynable, and in grete dispite hathe sworne their dethe yf they forsake not, theyr lawe and byleue. Alasse my dere syster it is true that I shoulde haue had one of the knightes in mariages, the which among al the liuing menne is the mooste fayrest, the mooste valyaunt, and the moost hardy, and that by force of armes hathe conquered my loue, wherfore lady I beseche you counsayl me, for I haue grete nede, and also that you shewe me the christen woman the whych you haue kepte so longe in this castell Fayre syster said the quene here may you se her. Than spake Bellyssant and sayd. Ladye what is your wil speke on hardely, for I haue grete desire for to here you speke. Alas lady I bring you tidings that wyll make you gladde and after sorowful and dysplesaunt. Know for a certainte that of your estate and of your lyfe I knowe the veray treuth, for pebe sister vnto king Pepin, and wyfe vnto the Emperour of grece, the which with wronge and againste righte hathe banysshed you out of his Empyre, and soone after you were deliuered of two fayre sonnes in a forest, wherof the one was taken away from you by a wild bere, and the other was lost you can not tell how. Now is your chyldren yet on lyue, and I knowe the place whereas you may fynde theym. At these wordes the quene Bellyssant

When the two chyldren that were in the darke pytharde the dore open, with ioyned handes deuoutly they kneled downe to the earth and cryed god mercye, for they wende well that the Gyaunt Ferragus hadde sent for them to make them dye. Ualentyne began for to wepe tenderly, and Orson sayde to hym. Take in you comforte and pacience for it behoueth vs to die and finishe our daies I se it clerely, but syth that it is soo that I se none other remedy, I thynke for too venge me or I dye on hym that setteth fyrst handes on me.

And whan he was at ye table his maners and countenaunce was soo pleasaunt and agreable to euery body, that of the barons and knyghtes he was moche beholden. And aboue all thynges of ladyes and damoy selles he was aduysed.

At these dolorous wordes entred the noble knyght valentyn in to the batayll, and as a man dyscomforted and charged wt melancoly, helde his swerde of fyne stele in his hande, and shewed suche knyght hode with his body that or euer he rested ony where slewe syxe or seuen paynyms deed to the erthe, and in doynge this prowesse the gyaunte Ferragus knewe him, and wente to warde Ualentyne and kepte hym so nere that he constrayned hym in suche wyse that he bare hym away before euery body, for his hors was deed vnder him.

And Pacolet that was amongest the hoost of the sarazyns cryed ryght hyghe, Portingale the more. And in makynge that crye he passed the batayl and came vnto the hoost of the christen men. And so they were delyuered all out of the hādes of theyr enemyes. And whan the christen men sawe that the duke was delyuered theyr courages grewe and theyr force doubled, and they were so Joyous that they cryed all with one voyce lyue Acquytayne. And in makynge that noyse they ranne vpon the sarazyns by suche a vygoure and force that they giaunt Ferragus after that he had loste many of his men by force of armes was constrayned for too flee and with drawe hym, and to reyse his syege & drawe abacke.

At the retornyng from the batayll Ualentyn and Pacolet retorned vnto theyr lodges, and Orson wente in to the palays with the duke Sauary and the other barons and knyghtes whan the duke of Acquytayne was retorned in to his palays, he sente for all the lordes and knyghtes of his con

Euen so as Fezonne was the whiche Orson founde loyall, for he sayd vnto the duke in this maner for to assaye her. Syr for the honoure that you do me I am bounden for to thāke you, but to the regarde of your doughter I wolde well knowe her wyll, for it apperteyneth her well to haue a man of more hygher estate than I. And therfore before that I take her I wyll speke to her for to knowe her wyll and courage. For maryage done agaynst the wyll cometh not lyghtly vnto perfeccyon, Knyghte sayd the duke of Acquytayne you haue good reason, and I accorde it you. Now go in to her chaumbre and speke with her, to the ende that you be the better enfourmed of her case. At these wordes he entred in to the chambre of the fayre Fezonne and sat hym downe besyde her. And syth he toke her by the hande & sayd vnto her muche swetely. Lady the grete beaute of you hathe taken me so sore in loue that withoute you I can haue none alegemente.

Wherfore I praye you ryghte dere lady ye for to haue more remembraunce the one vpon the other ye wyll enbrace me and kysse me at this presente tyne, and refuse not my louynge requeste I praye you For syth that for the tyme to come we muste be assembled you ought not to refuse me to do my wyll▪ Knyght answered the lady that was wel taught for to demaū

Lady said Orson it ought by reason to please you whan it pleaseth your father. Syr sayde the mayden.

And if it hapen that I be constrayned to suche a thynge by you, you shall be the cause to put my soule in daunger, whych shall be a reproche to you before God and the world. And as the

And whan the Duke aduysed him he went and enbraced him swetel

Sit saide Orson with good hert I pardon you. Than the Duke demaunded them how they had done sith theyr departinge. And orson recounted before them all the fortune and auenture that they had ben in, and how thei wer sonnes to the Emperoure of Constantinoble named Alexander, and of kynge Pepins sister named Bellessant, the whyche they had founden in Portyngale. Whan the duke of Acquitaine vnderstode that the two valyaunte knightes were of so hye a bloude extraught he had so greate Joye at his heart yt tel it I can not. Than he said knyghtes you be wo, thy for to haue grete honoure and reuerence

But of one thing I am sorowfull and dyspleasaunte that is of your fader the Emperoure of Grece, and of your vncle the kynge Pepin that are assyeged in Constatinoble by the painims and sarazyns and theyr warre hath endured so long that if god helpe them not shortly with socoure they muste yealde theim vnto theyr enmies, whiche is a thinge muche pyteous whan Ualentine hearde that his fader and hys vncle were in daunger he made such dole that none might appease hym and complained more his vncle Kinge Pepin than his fader. Than Pacolet said vnto hym.

And when thou shalt be within the cytie of Constantinoble, salue from me thy father the Emperoure Alexander, & thyne vncle the valyaunt kyng Pepyn my brother, and saye to hym on my behalue that I take vpon the dampnacion of my soule that neuer the dayes of my lyfe of the great blame and vytupere that I haue bene accused wt, I was neuer culpable. And if that there be any, be he neuer so hardy that wil take batayl for it, or say the contrary fyght you for me and take the quarell, for if you be ouercome I offre my body to be brente shamefully before al the worlde. My mother sayde the noble Valentyne dyscomfort you not, for if it please God almighty and the virgyn mary, in whome I haue all my truste I shall do so muche for you that shortly you shal be yelded and accorded to the Emperoure Alexander my father, and that of the wronge that he hathe done you, he shall aske you mercy and pardon. At these wordes they departed in sonore makyng great sorow, and weping

full sore. And at theyr departynge the Ladye enquyred her sonne Ualentine that also sone as he might he shol desende Pacolet agayne for to brynge her tydynges.

Frende sayd Pacolet doubte you not of nothing, for I am Pacolet that is come frō the hoost of the soudan Moradyn, where as I haue deliuered Ualētyne & the grene knight frō the handes of the sarazins yt had iuged & condā

Nowe he must be takē without any so iourning & flayne al quicke, for he hath well deserued it. when the chamberlayn vnderstode the tidinges, he went toward the Emperoure & the kyng Pepyn, the which for to se the soudā with a great nombre of knyghtes armed them. And the Soudan was in the hal that cryed hydeously sayinge. Ha false traytoure Pacolet mahoune curse the. For I haue well hard the & vnderstand the speke, thou haste betrayed me by thy false deceit cursedly & shamefully, but by ye fayth that I holde yet shall I make the repent it. Than he drewe oute hys swearde and as a madde than that were out of hys wytte began for to renne about the halle in smytynge the walles and the stoones soo rudely that he made the fyre to sprynge out of the marbyl stones▪ And so as he fought alone in the halle, the Emperoure and

Ualentyne and the greue knyght entred in to the palays whiche was come from the hoost of the soudan, and when thei founde hym thers they were muche ioyous. Then the Emperoure and kyng Pepyn made great ioye for the delyuecaunce of Ualētine, and also of the grene knight for he was muche praysed and loued. The Emperour thanked muche Pacolet for the delynetaunce of hys sonne valentyne, and the kyng Pepyn said vnto him. Pacolet fayre syr thou must shewe one gambaude with thy horse.

                  ON that same daye that Pacolette arryued within Acquytayne the kynge Trompart came in to the hoost of Ferragus with grete puyssaunce of men of armes too socoure hym agaynst the christen men, and in gret honoure receyued hym the kynge Ferragus, whyche for hys comyng made great feast through al his hoste Free kynge sayd the giaunt Ferragus of your coming I oughte to be Joyous for I haue esperaunce that by you I shall be auenged on them that haue deceiued my syster the fayre Clerymonde. Now I know well that she is within Acquytaine for she hathe bensene, wher fore I prayse littell my puyssaunce if I maye not haue her agayne. And yf that it be so that by your puyssaunce and healpe she may be conquered from this hour I gyue you her to wyfe. Ferragus sayd the king Tromparte of thys doubte you nothyng, for I haue brought with me Adramayne the enchauntour the which shal soone haue deceyued Pacolet, for he knoweth more of the arte of Nygromancye than all the liuynge creatures. By mahoune sayd Ferragus I am ryghte glad of his comynge, and yf he maye do so much as to yeld me Pacolet I shall make him of al the most ryche and puyssaunt. Syr sayd Adramayne haue trust in me, for I shall serue you so well that shortly you shal know it Than deparded Adramayne and made redy his chat me for to playe wyth his crafte, and syth went towarde Acquytayne. And to the ende that he myght enterin to it more surely he made hym to be laden with vytall so he dyd so muche by his engyn that he came befoore the gates, and asked entre for to selle his vytayls, He coude speke well to them of the cytye, wherefore they

opened hym the gates and he entred in for to sel his bytaylles. Then after he had solde thē he wente vnto the palays where as he founde Pacolet that knewe hym well, for he had sene him other tymes. Adramayne sayd Pacolet you be welcome. Nowe tel me if it please you from what place you come, and what thynge dryueth you hether at this houre. Pacolet sayde Adrymayn you knowe well that I haue serued long tyme kyng Tromparte. So it happened the other daye that by one of his courte I was smyten & outraged muche vyllaynously because that I would not learne him & shewe hym the secretes of my craft and when I sawe my selfe smyten I had dyspyte in my harte, and with a knyfe I slewe hym. when I had done that dede, for feare of deathe I yssued out of the cource. And thus expulsed from the seruyce of kyng Trōpart I am come towarde you for the truste that I thynke to fynde in you. And from henceforth I will abyde with you as loyall and true felowe if it please you that it be so. Adramayne sayde Pacolet I am contente, make good cheare and ca

And in makynge chere together Adramayne sawe the fayre Clerymonde passe through the halle, so he demaunded Pacolet what lady that was that was so fayre and gracious. Frende sayde Pacolet it is the faire Clerymond sister vnto king Ferragus the which muste be ryght hyghly maryed vnto a much tyche and valyaunt knyght. At that houre arryued Orson before the two felowes and sayde vnto them. Lordes playe a lytell betwene you both of your craft, and scyence for to reioyce all the company.

                  THan Adramayne lift vp a cup a aboue a piller, in such wise yt it semet vnto as them yt were there present yt thorowe yt place ran a great ryuer & an horryble, & in that same ryuer them thoughte they sawe all maner of fysshes hothe lytell & great. And whē they of the palays sawe the wa

                   so great, they begā al for to lift vp their gownes & to crye strongly as they that had fere to be drowned. And Pacolet that behelde the enchauntement began for to sing

and made a charme so subtyl in his songe that it semed vnto all them of the place that throughe the ryuer ran a great herte, that caste and hurled to the earthe al that he founde before hym. Then them thought yt they sawe hunters folowe hym wyth many greyhoundes and brachettes. Then there was dyuers of the company that lepte for the and wolde haue taken the harte, but Pakolet made the hart to lepe incontinent. By my fayth sayd Orson you haue played ryght well and you can vse ryghte well your arte. At these wordes rose vp the two enchauntours, and Pacolet that thought but all well led Adramayne into hys chambre for to slepe & repose hym that nyght, wherof he was ryght sorowfull and angry afterwarde, for whan it came towarde mydnyght Adramayne kest a charme throughe all the palays, that bothe lytle and great slepte so strongly that for cryenge nor brayenge they myght not waken vnto the morowe that the sunne was vp, and made Pacolet to slepe also well as the other. After he went towarde the hors that he hadde sene in the chambre, but he had made no semblaunte. And whan he had the hors he wente in to the chambre of Clerymonde and by hys subtyll arte in slepynge he made her to ryse and clothe her, and sette her on the hors wyth hym, and came vnto a wyndowe and torned the pynne, for he knewe well the guyse, and dyd soo muche that wythout soiournynge he arryued in the pauylyon of kyng Trompart wt the fayre Clerymonde. Then Adramayne cryed. Syr kynge Trompart slepe not, but ryse vp incontynent, for heare maye you see the pleasaunt lady Clerymonde, the whyche I haue stolen within acquytayne. And I haue done so muche & wroughte so subtylly that I haue stolen Pacolettes hors. Adramayne

sayd kynge Trompart at this houre I know that thou arte a true frende, and that aboue all other I am be holden vnto the. Is it not the doughter of the great kynge Justamon that is syster vnto kynge Ferragus. Yes sayd Adramayne I haue ryght subtylly stolen her awaye, and betrayed Pacolet the enchauntoure for of his hors he shall neuer haue the gouernynge. Adramayne sayd the kynge Trompate can thou playe also well as he yes sayd Adramayne I learned it longe ago. Then he shewed hym the maner and the facyon to forne the pynne and to gouerne the hors. And whan kyng Trompart had sene the subtylte, he thought within hym selfe that he wolde lede the fayre lady Clerymonde in to hys countre vpon the hors of wodde▪ and there take her vnto wyfe. Then he enbraced the fayre Clerymonde that slepte yet for the charme of Adramayne, and wyth hym sette her surely vpon the hors of wodde. And Adramayne behelde hym and sayd to hym. My lorde yf you fayle for to play with the hors you put your self in great daunger and peryll, and the lady also. No sayd Trompart of that haue no doubte, and then he turned the pyn ryght in hys course and went through a cloude so ferre that he went more than two hundred myle before daye And at that houre awakened the fayre lady Clerimond that was so dolent & sorowfull for to se herselfe in that estate that she fell in swowne, wherof the kyng Trompart was muche abasshed, and afrayd at his hert, for he wende that she hadde ben dead▪ He torned the pyn and stopped the hors in a fayre grene felde besyde a fountayne that was ryght fayre and clere. And whan he hadde discended the lady vpon the grasse, he toke of the water and cast it in her face to make her

                  yue agayne, and

the lady for the coldnes of the water began for to remoue a lytell and open her eyen, and began for to make so pyteous cryes and lamentacious that the kyng Trompart wende verely that at that houre her hatte woulde haue brosten, wherfore great sorowe toke hym. And he founde no maner how he myght succoure her saue by a shepeharde that was there besyde them, of whiche he demaunded some bread. And the shepeherde gaue hym a quarter of a lofe which he brought vnto the fayre Clerymonde, and put of it in her mouthe. The mayden ete a lytell, and with the fountaine she wasshed her thro

                  e. And when her harte was a litell come agayne and her speche strengthed she began for to wepe in sayinge. Alas vnhappy & aboue all dolorous what is happened me, no we haue I loste all my solace & my Joye vy vnhappy fortune and cursed treason. Alas my loue Ualē
                  tine nowe haue I lost you▪ of god be he cursed that hath departed vs. When the kynge Tromparte hearde the great lamentacions that the fayre Clerymonde made for her loue Ualentyne, he sayd vnto her muche rudely Lady leue suche wordes, and of the christen boye neuer speake more before me, or by my God mahoune I shall take thy lyfe from thy body. It is more ryght and reason that I wedde you, and that you be geuen me that haue my realme vnder my dominacion and lordshyp, than for to take that same vnhappy knaue that hathe neyther lande nor lordshyp. In saying these woordes he enclyned him towarde the lady and would haue kissed her, but the noble lady that of his loue was lytel curyous gaue him vpon the mouthe with her 
                     •
                  iste so that the bloude came out for the whiche the kynge Tromparte was muche angry & set her on the horse furiously

But it is sayde cōmonly that it is euyll thinking to be mayster of the crafte that they can nothyng of. Euen so dyd it to kynge Cromparte that wende well too haue played with Pacolettes horse, but he torned the pynne so euill that he faylled of his waye more than two hondred myle. ¶ And as he thought to haue aryued in his lande he arryued in Ynde the great a great place wher as market was kept that daye. And seynge all the people he descended on the groūde with the fayre lady Clerymonde. Of the whiche thyng they were muche ameruayled that sawe it. And at that houre the lady Clerymonde knewe the horse. For she myght not knowe him the nyght before for the great doloure that she was in. Alas Pacolet sayde the noble lady nowe am falsly betrayed, and you the fyrst of all robbed. Alas now maye I well say fare well my loue Ualentyne, aboue al the other moost curteys and amiable. By my god mahoune sayd the kyng Crompart that wende well to haue ben in his countrey if euer you speke to me of that christen boye ryght shortly you shall se & knowe with what loue I loue hym, for with my cutting sworde I shall make your head to fle of your shoulders. Now is Crompart well deceyued that thinketh to be in his countrey, and that for the fayre Clerymonde hathe wylled too playe Nygromancy for he is arryued in the place where as it behoueth hym to fynyshe his dayes. For after that he had bene sene of dyuers in the place, some saide among them that it was the great god mahoune that in fleshe and bloude for to vysite his people was descended frō heauen. The tydynges of this vysion came vnto the kyng of Ynde, the whiche cōmaunded that they should be brought before hym. Nowe in an euill houre ariued

the kyng Crompart, for also sone as the kyng of Ynde sawe hym he knewe hym.

                  AFter that the nyght was passed in the whyche Adramayne had betrayed pacolet: and ledde away the fayre Clerymonde, through the cyte of Acquytayne was made great lamentacyons for the losse of the lady, for the gardes of the palays that myssed her made so great lamentacyons and soo great noyse in the mornynge that throughe out all the cyte was the tydynges. And whan Pacolet knewe that he was departed / he doubted hym of some treason. Then he loked aboute the chambre and sa we anone that his hors was loste, soo he wronge his handes and drewe his heere in cryenge hyghely. A fals Adramayne by the I am deceyued. For falsly thou hast stolen my hors and my lady Clerymonde hathe borne away vpon hym. Well ought I to hate my lyfe whan by the I am thus betrayed and vnpuruayed of the thin ge that I moost loued. Now death come vnto me for to take me out of thys worlde, for I haue no more hope to haue comforte nor consolacyon. So pensyfe and sorowfull was Pacolet for the fayre Clerymonde that yf it had not ben Orson that came towarde hym he wolde haue slayne hymselfe wyth a knyfe. On euery syde of the palays was herde pyteous cryes, and wofull complayntes. Bellyssaunt the Empresse wepte and cryed sore. And the fayre Fezonne made suche dole that she rent her ryche clothes for the loue of Clerymonde that was stolen awaye so falsly. And all they of the cyte made innumerable complayntes & be waylynges. And amonge all the other it was a pyteous thynge to here the complaynt and lamentacyon of the good Duke of Acquytayne. And whan pacolet sawe the great sorowe that e

                  ry body made he sayd vnto them. Lordes I swere vnto

god that hath fourme all the world that I shal neuer haue Ioye of my lyfe nor comforte vnto the tyme that I haue taken vengeaunce of the traytoure Adramayne by the whyche we are betrayed and deceyued. At these wordes he departed heuy and sorowfull and put of hys gowne, and toke the habyte of a woman, in clothynge him ryght gentylly as a younge mayden. And in that estate departed out of of the cyte of Acquytayne, and went in to the hoost of the kynge Ferragus. And also soone as he was in the hoost of the paynyms there came out towarde hym that prayed hym muche of loue, bycause hym thought he was soo fayre a mayden. For Pacolet had wasshed hys face wyth a water ryght subtyl made by hys charme in suche maner that all they that beheld hym sayd amongest theym that they had neuer sene a more fayrer woman nor a more gracyous. Of dyuers paynyms and sarazyns he was beholden and requyred but euer he excused hym and sayd. My lordes pardone me, for at thys tyme I am promysed and haue made couenaunt wyth the enchauntour Adramayne, the which hathe reteyned me. Mayden sayd the other go on your waye. And so Pacolet toke the way to go vnto the enchauntour. Adramayne that was in the tente. And whan Adramayne sawe hym he was so enchaunted that Pacolet semed hym the moost fayrest woman that euer god created. And he was so muche enamoured on hym that for to slepe wyth hym that nyght he reteyned hym, and Pacolet accorded therto ryght gladly and sayd to hym My lorde knowe that I haue bene requyred of manye, but aboue all the other me thynke you are worthyest to be seruyd. Doughter sayd Adramayne doubte you of nothynge, but make good chere, for I haue a good wyl

for to serue you, and do you good tyght largely. Than Adramayn cōmaunded one of his seruauntes that he shoulde kepe the mayde, and that she shoulde be serued at souper with all maner of meates & wyne at her plea saunce. Nowe is the enchauntout Pacolet in the tente of Adramayn well and honestly serued. And Adramayn is in the hoost of kyng Ferragus seruyng. Frende said Pacolet to the varlet of Adramayne where is the kyng Trompart that is so puyssaunt and well renowmed. By mahoune sayd he my lady I thynke he is retourned in to his countrey, and leadeth with hym the fayre lady Clerymonde vpon a horse of wodde that my mayster hathe geuen him. When Pacolet harde those tidinges demaunde not if he was sorowful, but he made no semblaunt. Than entred Adramayne in to the tente, and presented wyne and spyces vnto Pacolet, & after sayde to hym. My doughter it is tyme to go to reste, se here ye bedde that you and I shall slepe in and do our pleasures. Lorde sayde Pacolet your wyll be done. And then Adramayne the enchauntour vnclothed hym & entred in to the bedde, thynking that the mayden would come and lye with hym. But also soone as he was in the bedde Pacolet enchaunted him in suche wyse, and made hym slepe so strongly that for any thynge that myghte be done vnto the morowe in the mornynge he myghte not a wake. And when he hadde made hym slepe so, he made all there aboute to slepe. Than he put of his womans clothyng, and put vpon hym the rychest clothes of Adramayne, after he toke a sworde that hanged in ye

                  ▪ teth so muche that he made hym lepe out of his bedde, & clothe him. Then Pacolet toke his gyrdle and tied it aboute his necke in suche wyse that as a beaste he ledde hym and made renne after hym vnto the gates of the cytie of Acquytayne. when Pacolet was at the gares of Acquytayne he founde the duke Sauary accompanied with dyuers lordes and barons that hadde muche desyre to knowe of that enterpryse. And also soone as they sawe Pacolet they sayd vnto hym. Frende where is Clerymonde that you bryng not her agayne. Lordes sayd Pacolet haue a litel pacience for at the first stroke with an axe the tree is not smyten downe. Knowe that of Adramaine I am auenged, forse here his head, and yet I haue done soo muche by myne arte that I haue brought Ferragus with me, the whiche all in slepynge I haue made renne after me through the fyeldes. By my fayth sayd Orson well haue you wrought. Lordes sayd Pacolet yet haue I done more maystrye, for in al the hoost of kynge Ferragus there is neyther paynym nor sarazyn but that they slepe vnder the trees muche strongly. And therfore if you will haue victory vpon them at this houre you maye confounde theym euery

Thus was the counsayll ordeyned, and the thynge delybered. Then they made Ferragus to be put in a darke pryson vnto their retournyng.

But & you wyll be baptyzed, and take the lawe of Ihesu christe, I shall saue your lyfe, and make you be honoured in my palays. By mahoune sayde Ferragus yet hadde I rather be dead, and then he was beheaded incontynent. ¶ After all these thynges, Orson woulde take leue of the duke of acquytayne for to go in to Constantynoble to succoure his father and the king Pepyn his vncle that were besyeged by the false sarazyns, and tolde the duke all his entencion.

Mother sayd Orson take comforte vnto you, for yf it please god you shal se him shortly that you desyre soo muche, and of the treason by the whyche you were accused you shall haue tydynges to your honoure but I am pensyshow we shall entre in to Constanstynoble.

Fare well the noble Bellyssant my mother, for you had neuer for me but a lytle pleasure nor comforte, and you shal neuer haue more but sorow and distresse. Fare well my valyaunt broder Orson that hath loued me with so good hert. For we hadde purposed to haue passed and fynysshed our dayes with our fader & moder, and no we by a case vnfortunate it is sodainly reuersed, whan the grene knyghte sawe that Ualentyne complayned him in be waylynge his frends, he said vnto hym. Syr for god forgete fader & moder frendes and kynnesmen, and make we prayes vnto God that he wyl haue mercy on vs, and receyue our soules into his paradise. Take we our leue of this life and in worthe the dethe for to susteyne the fayth, & haue we trust in God that for vs wold suffer death. How was y• soudan set in a chayre prepayred in great pryde rythly clothed, the which sayd Lordes I haue made an othe vnto

god mahowne that these two crysten knyghtes the why che at this present tyme and other tymes haue enforsed them for to bere vs domage shall dye vylanously wherfore aduyse you amonge you of what death they shall dye. In saynge these wordes Pacolet keste hymselfe in the prece, the which threwe suche a charme that for all that they had sene hym befoore in the tyme that the Soudan Moradyn was taken, yet at that houre he was not known of no body. He entred into the pauiliō where as the iudgemente was gyuen on the two chrysten knyghtes, and also soone as he apperceyued Ualentyne and the grene knight he set him on bothe his knees, and in sarasyns language by mahoune he salued the soudan / & syth sayd vnto hym thus. Ryght dere syr vnderstonde my message. Knowe that I am messengere vnto your broder Groart the puyssaunt kynge of Argy ere, the whych for to soucour you and for to confounde the christen men cometh toward you accompanied with foure kynges stronge and puyssaunt and a grete nombre of capptaynes that haue valyaunte knyghtes for to helpe you. And by me he sendeth you wordde to wete on what syde you syl that he set hys syege. And yf you haue ony christen prisoners that you sende hym them and he wyll make them be led into his contrie for to drawe the ploughe as dombe beastes. So me thynketh that I see heare twayne that shoulde be muche propre for to do suche payne, of whome your father shall be Joyous. In sayinge these wordes Pacolet blewe agaynste the Son dan and made a charme so subtyll that of all that why the he sayd was byleued. The Soudan was moche ioyous of thoose tydynges, and made hym too be well serued that nyghte, for he wende that he hadde sayd trouthe

Great ioye demeaned Ualentyne & the grene knyght in their hartes when they sawe Pacolet, but they made no semblaunt. Nowe the nyght was come that euery body withdrawe them vnto reste saue two hundred sarazyns that were in armes, the which were committed for to kepe the prysoners that nyght. But they made euyll watche for theim. For whem it came towarde mydnyght Pacolet wente vnto them, and in speaking vnto the sarazins by mahowne he kaste his charme by so subtyll a mater that they fell all vnto the earthe on slepe. Then he toke two good horses & came vnto the prysoners that were bounde against a pyller. And after that he had vnbounde them, in continent & without any delay he made them for to mounte on horsbacke. And in this wyse he did deliuer them, and caste thē out of their enemies handes▪ when they were in the fielde out of the hoost Pacolet said vnto them. Lordes make good there and take comfort vnto you. For know that vpon this lande is descended the good duke of Acquitayne, and the knyght Orson for to sucour you, and diuers capitaines with a great nonbre of fyghting men. And there is come also in their company, the noble Empresse Bellyssant, and the fayre Fezonne. Frende sayde Ualentyne, wherfore commeth not the fayre Clerymonde. By my faythe sayde Pacolet she woulde haue come ryght gladly, but also sone as she was mounted vpon the sea, for the odoure of the water she was so seke at her harte that it was force to leade her agayne in to Acquytayne. Ualentyne beleued hym and for that tyme he questyoned him no forder, for Ualentyne wende verely that he had said truthe. Then sayd Pacolet lordes goo in to Constantinoble and make to morowe in

And Ualentine recouted to them all the maner of his takinge. And howe that he and the grene knight hadde ben deliuered bi Pacolet out of the handes of the Soudan Bruiant. And tolde vnto them also the comminge of the duke of Acquitaine and of his brother Orson, whiche for to come and succour them hadde passed the see with a great nauie of men of armes, and finablie he tolde them all the enterprise that was made for to assaill the painims and sarazins, euen so as it had ben delibered bi Pacolet.

                  ANd when the bacayll had taken an ende & that the christen men were gathered together ogayne. Ualentyne & his brother Orson that knewe eche other came before the Emperoure in muche great reuerence. Father sayd Ualētyne here may you se my brother. Orson the whiche you neuer sawe, by whome you haue bene sucoured in this iouruey. When the Emperour embraced his son Orson pyteouysly wepyng, and also did the kyng Pepyn. Fayre sonne said the Emperoure will be you come for by you my ioye is doubled and my hope fortefyed. Orson sayde the kyng Pepyn do you not remembre howe ye smote me downe of my horse in the wodde whē I thased you. Fayre vncle or this I ought well to be remembred on and of diuers other thyng is done by me. But at this presed time we ought to thinke none other thynge but to thanke god of the victory that he hath geuen vs agaynst the enemies of the fayth, for with all our puyssaunce we ought to study in our hattes how we myght auenge Jesu Christe. For to heare those wordes all the company was greatly resoyled, and praysed muche the wysoome of Orson. Then assembled the Emperoure and kyng Pepyn Ualentyne and Orson and the grene knyght, Blandymayn and Guydarde the marchaunte that had vanquysshed the false Archebysihop. And in greate honoure and tryumphe wence for to se the tentes of the noble Empresse Bellyssant and of the fayre Fezonne, the which in abiding the dyscomfyture of the sarazyns were in a fayre pauylion honestly accompanied, and there they prayed deuoutly vnto God that it would please him to kepe the Emperoure and his men from the dannger of the paynyms,

whan the Empresse Bellyssant knewe that the batayle was wonne she sayd duty Fezonne. My dough ter make good chere for you shal se the Emperour anone the whiche is Orsons father that hath takē you vnto wyfe. Mother sayd Fezonne god be thanked, for to se suche a thynge I haue great desyre. In sayenge these wordes the Emperour arryued before the pauylyon of the ladies and all hys companye. And whan the ladies apperceyued hym they went out agaynst hym. Than whan the Emperour apperceiued his Wyfe Bellyssant he lepte of his hors in wepynge and syghinge tenderly And wythout that he might speke ony worde he enbraced the lady the whyche set her vpon both her knees. In that place assembled the Emperoure and the good lady that by the space of twenty yere and more hadde ben separate in sondre. Now it is not to be demaunded yf for to fynd the one the other they were Ioyous, and if that by profounde pyte they had theyr heartes touched & oppressed so that by naturall loue they fell vnto the earth in arme togyther in a swowne. And whan valentyne and Orson sawe the greate pyte of thir father and mother moche tenderly and pyteyusly they beganne for to wepe and harde besyde them they fel bothe in a swowne. The kinge Pepyn and dyuers other barons & knyghtes that behelde that thynge beganne moche tenderly lor to wepe. And after that the Emperoure and hys wyfe Bellyssant had aswaged theyr dolours, and that they were awakened out of theyr swowne y• emperour sayd vnto his wife. Alas my loue muche ought it to displease me at the heart the doloure and payne that your body hath suffred sith your exyle. But and yf it please you I praye you pardon me for my great faute, for with

greate payne maye ony kepe them frome treason. My lorde sayd the good lady of the trybulacion that I haue bene in, haue you no thought. For syth the houre that I sawe you of all my dolours I haue had aledgemente & comforte. But of one thyng I praye you that is that it wil please you to shewe me the good marchaunt by the whyche the treason hath ben knowen, and the false archebysshop ouercomen. My loue sayd the Emperoure here may you se hym for it is the good guydarde by the whiche the thynge hath ben knowen and your honoure saued. Frende sayde the lady vnto the marchaunte well are you worthy to be byloued and holden dere amonge all the other, for the great prouffyte that you haue done to the Emperoure of Grece and to the noble bloode of Fraunce. Wherfore frome hens forwarde I reteyne you for my chamber layne, & with that I wyl that you haue for your payne a thousande marke of fyne golde. Ladye sayd the marchaunt I thanke you and al my lyfe I shal serue you truely. Than spake Ualentyne vnto his moder and sayd. My lady mother please it you to speke to

they ymagyned mortall treason against him with all their puyssaunce. And sayd the one to the other it was to great a reproche vnto them and to greaous whan yt Orson was eleuate more in honoure then thei. By god sayd Haufray vnto his brother Henry, well ought we to praise our puyssaunce litell whan we can not take vengeaunce of Orson for if he reygne long we shall se the time that by him we shalbe casten out of the realme of Fraunce, brother sayd Henry you haue sayd truthe. Now we be but two brethren germaynes and now to comforte the one the other and helpe agaynst our enemies, but vpō this mater I can not tel what to thinke Henry sayd Haufray vnderstande my reason, we haue two nenewes that are the sonnes of our eldest syster, that is for to wyte Florente and Garniere, the whiche are muche hardye and fyerse. And me thinketh that by them twayne a treason should be sone conspyred and made soner then by vs, for they knewe well for a truthe that the kyng loued them not, and that he would geue soner credēce vnto other then them. On the other part the one is botyller of the kyng, and the other is vssher of the chambre that he slepeth in. And by the meanes of theym twayne we may entre in to the chambre of king Pepyn oure father and slee hym in his bedde, and euery body wyll saye that it hath bene Orson, for aboue al the other he is the chiefe garde of his body, and trusteth moost in hym. And by this meane the sayd Orson shall be condampned to death, and the realme shall be holly in our handes, for our brother Charles is not yet puyssaunt ynough for to gouerne vs. Haufray sayd Henry you haue ryght well deuysed▪ but for to accomplysshe this thyng it is expedient to make great dylygence, in

You know that the kyng Pepyn how well that he is our father neuer loued vs in his life with good hert. Euer with his puyssaunce he hath reysed vp the straungers and exalted them in honoure and in all offices and dignyties, more than vs, wherfore all these thynges consydered my brother Henry and I that are youres vncle legyty mes (wyll and consent) and are delybered for to make kyng Pepyn dye.

And on the moro we in the morning when the tidinges shal be that the kyng is dead, the charge and the blame shall be gyuen vnto Orson, because that euery nyght he slepeth and resteth moost nerest his body, and so he shall be iudged and condempned vnto death. And after these thynges we shall take the lyfe sone from the lytel Charles. And by this meane the realme shall abyde vnto vs for to departe it after our pleasures. Uncle sayde Garnyere of this feate doubte you nothynge, for kynge Pepyn your father shall lese his lyfe. Now was the treason ordeyned agaynst kyng Pepyn that thought none yll, by the two cursed children that had no pite to make their father dye. In an euill houre is the chylde borne that would purchase suche a death agaynst his father. And in an euill houre was euer engendred Haufray & Henry when by them treason was done, & many countreys marred. By theym was their neuewe Garnyete full of so euill will that sone after that the treason was made he espyed a nyght as the kyng souped and tooke a sharpe poynted knyfe & subtylly entred in to the chambre tyall, and behynde the hangyng he hydde hym soo secretely that he myght not be apperceyued of no body. And when the houre was come that the kyng shoulde go vnto reste, by the gardes and chaberlaynes he was brought vnto bedde as the custome was. The king entred into the bedde, the whiche recommaunded him vnto God muche deuoutly, and all yssued out of the chambre saue Orson that deuysed with the kynge to slepyng time. And when Orson sawe that the king would slepe

Pepyn for to acheue his enterpryse, but when he was besyde hym, and that helyfte by his arme for too haue put hym to death, hym thoughte that the kyng woulde haue wakened, wherfore so great feare toke hym that he let hymselfe slyde downe by the bedde syde, where as he was a great whyle and durste not remeue hym. After he woulde haue sinytten secondly, but so great fere toke hym as he woulde haue smyten hym, that all hys body fayled, and began for too tremble in suche wyse that he myght not acheue his enterpryse, and put the knyfe within the bedde. After he tetourned in to hys place all tremblyng for to hyde hym in abydynge the day, so strongly afrayd that he would haue bene a thou sand myle beyond the sea. And Orson was in his bedde that of that dede doubted nothing, and dreamed a mar ueilous dreame. For it semeth him in sleping that they would haue taken awaye the honoure of his wyfe Feronue. And that besyde her was two theues that conspyred treason agaynst him. After hym thought that be syde a ponde he sawe two great herons that foughte with a hawke, and with all their puyssaunce enforced them for to slee hym. But the hawke defended hym so valiauntly that he trauayled the two herons in suche wyse that they had bene both dead if it hadde not bene a great multytude of lytell byrdes that descended vpon ye hawke, and would haue slayne hym anone if there had not come an. Egle that succoured hym. In this dreame Orsou awakened that of this dreame was much amat ueyled and began for too saye.

And there he founde the two brethren Haufray and Henry & wyth them Florent the whyche had great desyre and lust to knowe some tydynges of theyr cursed and dysloyall treason. Beware Garnyete that you tell vs the trouthe howe our enterpryse gothe. Lordes sayd Garnyere by the god almyghty that hath created al the worlde for all the rychesse of Fraunce I wolde not doo so muche agayne as I haue done. And as to the regarde of kynge Pepyn knowe that he is yet on lyue, for euen so as I thought for to haue slayne hym I was soo afrayed that my hearte faylled me, and wolde not haue had the courage for to haue dommaged hys body for all the golde in the worlde. But of another treason I aduy sed me, for I haue left the knyfe yt I bare in the kinges bedde. So I haue thought that we shall accuse Orson of treason and shall tell the kynge that they are. iiii. of one appoyntment that are delibered for to sle the king, of whome Orson is the pryncypall, and shall saye also that they wyl make the lytle Charles to dyefor to haue bytwene them foure the realme of Fraunce wyth the apperrenauntes. And for to preue oure feate the better and be byleued of thys thynge we shall tell how Orson hathe made redy hys geare, and lefte the knyfe wyth in the bedde.

Thus was the treason the seconde time conspired against the noble knyght Orson, the whiche of all this dede was pure and innocent.

And whan Garniere sawe that it was tyme for to speake, he entred in to the halle and came before the kyng, the whiche he salued with great reuerence & sayd to him. Redoubted sit it is true that of your benigne grace you haue made me knyght and geuen me office in your courte more honester than vnto me appertayueth.

enemyes I demaūde ryght before euery body, & the law of your londe that is suche that whan a knyght is accused of murdre and treason, & he wyll defende hym in batayll he ought to be receiued. Now I am a knyght that holdeth my selfe without reproche and innocent of the dede, so I wyll by the ordenaunce aboue sayd be receyued in my defences, yf by the assystens of your courte it be ordeyned and iudged me. And for to make my selfe crele lo here my gloue that I present before you all to abyde batayll. And yf I he ouercomen in batayll do Justyce with my body euen as muche a case requyreth. Orson sayd Garnyere of suche a thynge you may wel holde your peace, for neuer pleaseth it god that for a thing proued I take batayll agaynst you. Ha traytoure sayd Orson it is nothing proued, yf it

Upon these wordes the twelue peres of Fraunce made to haue Orson out of the place wyth histwo aduersaryes for to dispute the reasons of bothe partyes. Soo it was Judged by them that the demaunded of Orson was reasonable, & that he ought to be herde and receyued in hys reasons, And than they made Garnyere and his brother to come before the kynges presence. And the duke Myllon dangler demaunded Garnyere whyche were the foure persones that were consentynge to the kinges death. Lordes sayd Garnyere of that enquyre no more, For I wyl not t

agaynst hym, for sythe that you wyll not declare them that are culpable of the thyng, it is lightly to be beleued that in your feate is malyce. Joyous was Orson of that appoyntement, and keste his gloue vnto the twoo traytours saying. Lordes se here my gloue that I deliuer vnto the two traytours Garnyere and Florente in suche a coucnaunt that i

                   I may not conquere them. I offre my body to be hanged shamefully. Now auaunte sayd the kyng the thyng is accorded and the Jugement is geuen. But for to bryng vnto an ende the enterpryse it behoueth you too geue hostage and surete, for to bee forth comyng at the daye assigned. Then Haufray and Henry abode and offred their bodyes for Florente and Garnyere. And the duke Myllon, and the duke Sampson Galeram and Geruays offred their bodyes and abode for Orsō. And ꝓmised to yelde hym agayne at the monethes ende that was assygned. Soo when the ende of the monethe was come, and the day that they shold fyght, the duke Myllon dangler. Sampson Galeram, and Geruays brought forth Orson, for he was well beloued of them. And when he was armed and mounted on horsebacke, he rode thoroughe the cytie muche noblye accompanyed towarde the place ordeyned. So he hadde not longe bene there when Haufray and Henry entred in to the fielde with their twoo neuewes rychely armed. Muche redoubted Garnyere and Florent theyr aduersarie Orson. But Haufray and Henry euer comforted them, and promised them succour. And euen so as they were entred into the fielde for to do their deuoure, the bysshop of Parys went towarde theim and made them al thre for to swere vpon a boke as the custome is. And after the bysshop wente out of the fielde

After came the heraudes & the kepers of the fielde that made all to yssue out that were within saue the. iii. chā

Now Haufray had appointed thre hondred mē that he had put within a great place the nerest the field that he myght. and sayde and commaunded vnto them that also sone as they should here him blowe his horn that they should come to warde hym. wel thought the traytours to haue bene succoured and defēded in theyr necessitte, but lytell auayled all their enterpryse, for also sone as the gardes commaunded the champeons to do their deuoure, Orson couched his speare and smote his horse with the sporres & came against his enemies by muche great courage and he gaue garniere so great a stroke that he persed his shelde & his harneis through out. And Florent was on the other syde that gaue Orson a muche matueylous stroke, but he set as muche by it as it he had smytten agaynst a toure. False cursed traytout and disloyal thou hast accused me with wrōg, but to daye I shall shewe the where loyalte doth reste. ¶ At these woordes with his bryght swoorde he gaue Garniere so great a stroke that he smote him out of his sadle vnto the earth, and subtylly there withall he pulled his helme of his head, and after would haue cut of his head if it had not ben his brother Florent yt smote Orson muche rudely. Then Orson retourned & smote Garnyere in suche wise that he cut of his lefte eare, and syth sayd vnto him, fayre maister that purchaceth trea son you ought not to lose by the bergayne. There began a strong batayll betwene the thre champions. Garnyere conquered his helme agayne and put it on his head and came to warde Orson for to dammage him with al his might. But he had bene discomfited anone if it had

not bene Florent that oftentymes socoured hym.
            
            
               
                  ❧ How Orson slewe Florent in the fielde, & banquyshed Gatnyere, and howe Haufray cut of his head as he would haue confessed the treason. Cap. lx.
               
                  
               
               
                  ORson had muche payne and trauayll for to confounde the two traitours for they were strongly armed and also toke courage, for Haufray and Henry that hadde promysed them succoure and helpe, and Orson dydde

so about Garniere that he wounded him right sore. So whan he felt himself woūded he descended to the earth & habandoned his horse. After he came agaynst Orson and smote his horse in suche maner that he cut of one of his legges and felled hym vnto the earthe. But Orson was dyligent and strong, for when he felt the horse fall he auoyded the styropes and lept vpon the earthe. And syth came vnto Garnyere and toke hym betwene his armes so mightely that he toke his shelde from him and threwe him to the earth, but as he would haue gyuē hym a 
                     •
                  oyne in the belly. Florente sported his horse for to surour his brother, and gaue Orson so great a stroke vpon the helme that he made hym for too rele. Orson ran vnto hym that had dispyte and smote hym with so great a courage that he ouerthrewe the horse dead too the earth, and toke of Florentes helme from his head, of the whiche he was sore abasihed, and founde none other remedy saue for to flee and renne about the fielde in coueryng his head with his shelde. And Orson ran after hym with a fyerse courage that for to se hym flee had great pleasure. Ha Florent sayd Garnyere wherfore flee you so much, retourne you agayne and thinke for to defende you, for if you haue good courage to day he shall be vanquyshed. At these wordes the two traytours assayled the valiaunt Orson muche asperly, and with their trenchyng swordes gaue hym so many strokes that through his harneys the strokes entred, and made the bloud to yssue out by greate haboundaunce. Then Orson that felte hymselfe wounded reclaymed God and the virgyn Mary muche deuoutely, and gaue Florent so great a stroke that he smote of his arme wt the sword. During this batail Fezone was in a church

in prayinge god deuoutly that it wolde please hym for to kepe her good loue Orson & defende hym in gyuyng him victorye agaynst hys enemyes. The people was moche abasshed of ye great dedes of armes that Orson dyde. Dolente and sorowful was Florent whā he had loste his arme, and not for that he left not for to assayl Orson wyth all his puyssaunce. ¶ And whan Orson sawe him come he made semblaunte for to smyte Garnyere and after drewe his stroke agayne sodaynly and smote Florēt in suche maner that he smote him downe deed to the erthe, after he sayd vnto Garnyere. Traytoure thou muste go after or elles knowledge before euery body ye treasō that you haue braced. ¶ Orson said Garnyere it shal go other wyse, for if you haue slayne my brother, to day I shal take vengeaūce. ¶ Haufray sayd Henry our feate goeth euyll for Orson hath alredy slayne and vndone our neuewe Florent, & you shall se anone yt he wyll vaynquysshe Garnyere & make him confesse the treason, by the whiche we shall be for euer dyshonoured and in daunger of deathe yf we fynde not maner for to fle & escape. Brother sayd Haufray that was full of treason. I shal tel you what we shal do Also so one as we shall se that Garnyere is ouercomen or that he confesse the treason we shall entre into the felde and in signe for to maynteine Orson we shal cut of our neuewes head. And so the treason may neuer be knowen. By God sayd Henry none can say nor deuyse better. Thus thought the two cursed & dysloyall traytours newe treasons for to hyde the olde. And the two champions are within the felde yt assaylleth eche other moche asprely. Garnyere sayd Orson you se wel that you maye not defende you agaynste me. And therfore

thynke for to yelde you & confesse your cursed treason, and I promyse you for to saue your lyfe and make your peas towarde kynge Pepyn, and shall sende you vnto the Emperoure of Grece my father that for the loue of me shall reteyne you of hys courte and gyue you great wages. Boye sayd Garnyere thy promyse serueth me of nothynge, for syth that I haue lost one of myne eres I shall neuer be praysed nor honoured in no place. So Had I rather dye valyauntly agaynste the, or conquere thy body & delyuered the vnto shamefull death than for to defylemyne honoure. By my fayth sayd Orson right gladly I accordeth you. And syth that you haue enuy for to dye, you shall haue founde in me a good mayster Thynke for to defende you, for here is your laste daye, At these wordes he went towarde Garnyere and wyth strengthe of armes throwe hym vnder hym, and pulled hys helme from hys head. And Haufray whyche sawe that there was no more remedye, cryed right hye Orson slee him not for we knowe right well yt wyth great wronge he hath accused you, so we wyll do the Justyce as to the traytour apperteyneth, we wyl neuer let hym lyue nor holde hym of our parentage. He entred into the felde and sayd vnto Garnyere. Fayre mayster confesse your dede and the maner of the treason, and we shall do so muche to the kynge that of your fautes ye shal haue pardon. Lordes sayde the traytour Garnyere I haue done the treason and put the knyfe in the kinges bed In sayenge these wordes Haufray that was subtyll and cautelous drewe hys swerde, & to the end that he shuld speke no ferther forthe of that thynge he slewe hym in the same place and after sayd. ❧ Lordes nowe let thys traytour be taken and hanged on the galowes, for he

hath well deserued it. Then he sayde vnto Orson. Losyn I am tyght Joyous of the vyctory that you haue had, for God hath wel shewed that you are true and loyal. And for al that Garnyer was my neue we, yet shal I neuer clayme hym for my bloud syth he hath wylled to medle with treason. Anoue came thether the fayre lady Fezonne that colled and kyssed Orson ryght swetely. And than kyng Pepyn demaunde hym. Fayre neue we haue you any daungerous wound vpon your body. Uncle sayd Orson no thanked be God. I haue vanquyshed the two traytours & Haufray as a good man hath made Garnyere confesse the treason and takē his lyfe from him. Ha fayre neuewe beleue it not to lightly for what semblaūt that euer he make you he is partysypyng of the treason, but for this present tyme I wyll holde my peace. The king and the barons retourned in to the cytie of Parys and made great ioye for the victory that Orson had wonne and the honoure. And Haufray and Henry that same day said muche good of him with their mouthes, and with their hartes desyred his death. But anone after came the tyme that their cursed treason was knowen, and that they were punished for their euylles as they had wel deserued. So I shal leue to speake of this mater and will tell you of the knyght Ualentyne that rode through the countrey right sorowful for his loue the fayre Llery monde, the which was in Jnde the more where the kyng made her to be kept for to wedde her and toke her vnto wyfe by the waye of mariage as I haue made mencion vnto you here before.

                  UAlentine that was mounted vpō the sea for to seke the fayre Clerymonde his loue dyd so much by the grace of god that he arriued in the cytie of Antioche. So when he was within Pacolet that spake their language

Then departed dyuers offycers with the hoost for to go and fetche Ualentine the whiche thei brought wt his seruauntes before the kyng of Antioche. And when Ualentine sawe the king he salued him highly saying. ¶ Syr kynge mahoune in whome you beleue kepe you with suche power as he hath. And that same God that dyed for vs on the crosse succout and helpe me in mine aduersyte.

Whan I must do it by force the playe is euyll for me at departynge. Not for that tell me yf it please you yf you haue sene the beest, and of what fourme and stature she is of, and what is her maners and facyons. Chrystyen sayd the kyng of Antyoche I tell the that I haue sene the beest, and wyte that she is muche hedyous and more gretter of body than a horse, and she hathe also wynges ryght great, and fethered lyke a Gryffon, and hath the head of a serpent, wyth a maruaylous loke, the skyn couered wyth scales muche harde & thycke as fysshe that swymme in the see. And she hath also the fete of a lyon muche great and sharper than any kynfe of stele. ¶ By my god sayd valentyne by this that you tel me the best is muche ferefull and horryble, but not wythstandyng all her force and strengthe yf you wyll bylene in Jhesu chryst that for vs suffred death vpon the crosse, and promyse me for to receyue baptym in suche case that I conquere the beest and put her vnto death I shall goo and assaye me agaynst her, & put my body in daunger wyth out ledynge any erthely creature wyth me by the grace of Jhesu christ, Chrysten sayd the kyng I swere the by my lawe that yf thou mayst dystroye her I and all my men shall renounce mahoune and doo all thy pleasure, but so muche dare I saye that thou shalt haue no puyssaunce therto, for there wente neuer none thether yet yt escaped deuourynge. ¶ Syr sayd valentyne lette me dele wyth her. For I truste me so muche in the swete Jesus that he shall be my swerde and defence agaynst the false beest, vpon suche a touenaunt that you shall holde

Well sayd Ualentyne I shall do my besy payne. Then he demaunded the worke men of the cytie and made them make a shelde ryght subtylly composed. And in that same shelde he made to fasten a great sorte of longe pryckes of fyne stele more sharped then nedles, strong and surely put in, and they were of a fote length. And when the shelde was thus made valentyne put on his harneis and his helme also bokeled to his head, after he toke his sworde and in the honoure of Jhesu christe kyssed the hylces many tymes. And he toke his leue of his men and mounted on horsebacke, & for to go fyght with the beast yssued of the cytie. Lytell and great mounted vpon the walles toures & garettes for to beholde valentyne. And when he was out of the cytie, the portets shytte the gates after hym, for they wende well for a truthe that he shoulde neuer haue retourned. Nowe the beast is of suche a condycion that it behoueth them to deliuer to her euery daye for her pray a beast or a manne, and if they fayled for to geue it her, there dutst no body yssue out of the cytie.

Ha God saide Valentyne helpe me and preserue me from entring in to that foule passage, and gyue me strengthe and puyssaunce for too exalte and encrease youre lawe. Then he descended of his hors and left his sharpe axe at his sadle bowe: and went towarde the serpent that was muche proude, & also soone as he approched nere hym for to smyte him the serpent lyfte vp his pawe that was great and large and marueylously sharpe for to smyte Ualentyne, but he cast his shelde before it, in suche maner that the beast smote vpon the broches that were sharpe, and dyd her selfe great hurte, in castyng out a hydeous crye and drawyng hymselfe abacke. And Ualentyne pursued her yt had a hardy courage, but when the beast sawe hym approche she rose streight vp vpon her hinder free, and wt her fore fete wende for to haue beten downe Valentyne vnder her, the whiche was couered with the shelde, and for the doubte of the shelde she withdrewe her abacke. ¶ By mahowne and termagaut sayd the kyng of An

                  THe batayll was ryght tyers without the cytie betwene Ualentyne and the serpente, for if it had not ben y• prycked sheld y• the beast doubted he would haue casten Ualentyne vnto the earth muche quickely, but he helde his shelde with the which he could

well helpe hym selfe. And in the other hande he helde his sworde wherewith he gaue the serpente a marueylous stroke vnder the eare, but the stroke was soo harde that he brake his sworde. Ueray God sayde Ualentine helpe me and succoure me agaynst this fende that is so hortyble and fyerse. Ualentyne was in great daunger when his sworde was broken, for the beast began for to chaufe her, and smote Ualētine in suche maner with one of her pawes that she all to rente his harneis with her nayles. Then Ualentyne drewe out a sharpe glayue and haste it soo euen at the beaste that it entted halfe a fote in to her throte but she set not therby. Ualentyne seyng that, ranne vnto his horse and tooke the axe that hanged at his sadle bowe, and retourned vnto the beast in makyng the sygne of the crosse before hym, and demaundyng comforte of God, so he approched nere the beaste that watched hym strongly and with his cuttyng axe smote her vpon the tayle so rudely that he cut the skynne vnto the bone, and made the bloude to yssue out by the great stremes. The sarazyns and paynims were muche abasshed that were vpon the walles of the great prowesse of Ualentyne. And the quene Rozemonde that behelde hym muche gladly sayde vnto herselfe all alone. Ha knyght fayre syr mahoune helde the and bryng the agayne with Joye, for by mahoune in whome I beleue, of all the knyghtes that euer I sawe my harte is moost taken with thy loue. Thus sayd the quene Rozemonde that loued hym ardauntly. And Valentyne fyghteth with the dragon that caste her heuy tayle oftentymes at hym and trauayled hym so sore that she had all mo ost smyten him downe, but he helde his axe surely, with the whiche he coulde well playe, &

he gaue the serpent suche a stroke that he cut of a quarter of her tayle, and then she made so great a crie that al the cytie sowned therof, after she flewe ouer Valentins head and pulled of his helme and smote hym too the groūde, but by his diligence he rose vp quickely sorow full and displeasaunt that his head was bare. He began for to reclayme God and the virgyn Marye in bewayllyng oftentymes the tayre Clerymonde. When they of the cytie sawe that he had lost his helme they thought well that he should neuer escape. By my God saide the Kyng nowe may we well say that the christen knyght shall neuer come hether agayne. Than was Pacolet muche sorowfull & pyteously began for to wepe for the loue of Valentyne. Halas said he make the gates to be opened to me, and delyuer me a harneys, for I wil this daye lyue and dye with my maister, and also make me to be deliuered a helme, for I will bere it hym for to couer his head, Pacolet was armed anone and a helme geuen him, and also the gates opened. He recōmaūded hym vnto God and went rennyng vnto the fielde. Ualentyne sawe hym come well but he knewe hym not, & Pacolet cryed vnto hym saying, syr. I am your seruaū

And he dyd so muche by his armes that within foure monethes the cytie was delyuered vnto hym by a false traytout, and there was the king taken of his enemies the whiche made hym to be put vnto death in the myddes of the cytie because that he would not renounce the faythe of Thesu christ after he sent his doughter Rozemonde into his countrey, and of the realme of Antyoche made hymselfe too be crowned kynge. After these thynges done he put hymselfe vpon the sea for to retorne into his realme, but by orage and tempest he descended in the lāde of Grece beside a tytie named Cretophe the which was a great & a large citie. Now it happened that for certayne thinges the Emperour of Grece was newely atryued there, and fortune was so peruers that he whiche knewe nothyng of the commyng of the paynyms yssued out of the cytie accompanied of the grene knyght and dyuers other lordes strong and valyaunt for to take their disporde, but in an cuill houre yssued they without garde and watche, for by the men of bran dyffer that no body knewe of the emperoure & the grene

knyght were taken, and all they of their company were taken and discomfyted. And at that same houre the pay nyms ronne vnto the gates of Cretophe, where as they loste theyr payne, for the cytie was strong and gatny shed with suche men that it behoued them to returne sodaynly agayne. Angrye and sorowfull were they of Cretophe for the losse of the Emperoure and the grene knyght, for the whiche they made a letter and sente it by a heraude to the Empresse Bellyssant, in maundyng her tydynges of the taking of the Emperour and demaundyng succour agaynst their enemies, to the end that the paynyms should not lede the Emperoure in to their countrey. ¶ Sorowfull was the lady for the takyng of her husbande and wept without ceasyng. She sent for her captaynes and made to assemble men of armes throughe all the Empyre of Grece in great dylygence. And on the other syde she sent heraudes to warde the realme of Fraunce, for to haue succoure of her brother kyng Pepyn and of her sonne Orson, & comfort in her aduetsite. Within a shorte time yssued out of the cytie of Constantinoble a great hoost of them of the countrey of Grece for to go vnto Cretophe to succoure ye emperoure agaynst Brandiffer. But that same Brandiffer that was subtyll and malicious, had put tyders in the countrey aboute, by the whiche he knewe the enterpryse of the Grekes. And for seare of their puyssaunce & to lese his prysoners, with all his hoost entred in to ye sea, and they rowed and sayled so muche that they arryued within a lytel whyle in Lize, and in that place they toke grounde and went vnto a strong castell that was called so, in the whiche he made to be kept prceyouslye his two doughters Rozemonde and Galyze, that passed

al other creatures in beaute. And for the great beau te of her she had ben demaunded of her father Brandiefer that same yeare by fourtene kynges strong and puissaunt. And because that Brandyffer woulde not mary her yet he made her to be kepte sumptuously in that castell, because that it was the strongest of all his lande. That same castell was hyghe, and had manye greate thycke squate coutes, and wel fortefyed, in the middes of the castell was a dongeon of latyn which had a double gate of yron strong and thycke. The castell was enuyroned with deye dytches full of rennyng water, and in the myddes of the castell and of the dyche there was a brydge composed so subtylly that there myght passe but one man at ones. For & it twayne would haue passed they should fall bothe in to the rennyng water and there be drowned. And at the ende of that same brydge, there was two horryble lyons and strong that kept the entre of the castell. In the dongeon was the mayden ga lazye kepte. And vnder the sayde dongeon was a caue ryght profounde and depe, in the whiche the Emperour and the grene knyght was put with ten other christen men the whiche remayned there in captyuyte by the espace of many yeares in great anguyshe. So I shall leue you to speake of this matter and shall tel you hereafter ensewyng of the fayre lady Clerymonde the which the kynge of ynde the great helde in his house as I haue made you mencion of before.

Nowe ye myght well knowe that for the loue of you wythin Antyoche I was charged wyth dyshonoure in peryll and daunger to lose my lyfe.

But with the will of my father that was vnto myne contrary I was refused vnto the kyng ynde, and gyuen vnto the kyng Lucar. Nowe it is true that the same kyng of ynde for acquayntaunce of loue sende me a ringe ryght ryche that which I haue derely kept with all my harte for the loue of hym, and knowe that I neuer tolde it to no man lyuyng saue too you. But for as muche as I haue sene the falsnes & ma ladiccion of Lucar the whiche sendeth you in to ynde for to be delyuered of you I shall geue you comforte wt all my puyssaunce that shall kepe you from perill, and shall acheue your message and retourne hether agayne as a hardy and a valyaunt knyght. And howe wel that I wote and knowe for certayn that of my loue you haue no nede, and that you are promised vnto another la dy more hyghe more fayrer, and more excellenter then I am, yet wyll I not forget the loue that my harte was taken with for you when I sawe you within the cytie of Antyoche as you conquered and vanquished the hor ryble dragon. And for the thynges aboue sayd for to encrease your honoure I shall tell you what you shall do when you shall be afore the kyng of ynde arryued after the reuerence made and the salute geuen fro the kynge Lucar that sendeth you to warde hym, without longe abydyng greate him from meas my loue and secrete frende and saye vnto him that how be it that my father gaue me vnto kyng Lucar yet haue I not put his loue out of mynde, but haue stedfast purpose and good wyll that once in my lyfe I shall drawe me towarde hym,

and of me he may do his wyll and good pleasure. And tell hym also that I shall fynde the meanes to go with the kyng Lucar when he ledeth his hoost into ynde, and then maye he haue me yf he haue any prowesse in him and leade me a way. And to the ende that the king of ynde thynke not that your woordes is fayned you shall bere him this rynge. Lady sayd Ualentyne of the good wyll that you haue for to succoure me and giue aledgemente I thanke you humbly, and haue you noo doubte of the remnaunte, for I shall do youre message so well by the grace of God to the kyng of ynde, that in shorte space you shall haue tydynges. At these wordes Ualentyne toke leue of the lady Rozemonde and went towarde kyng Lucar that for too conduyte hym, gaue him ten maryners, the whiche passed him ouer a great arme of the sea that is betwene Esclardye and ynde, & also they mounted vpon the sea and had wynde agreable, so good that they departed from Esclardye at none and vpon the moro we they arryued at a porte that is but two myle from the cytie of ynde the great. In that same place descended Ualentyne & drewe his horse out of the shyppe, after he mounted vpon him and said vnto the maryners. Lordes abyde me here til that I come agayne and my message be accomplysshed, for if it please God I shal not make long soiournyng or I retourne agayne. By mahoune sayde a maryner to the other all alowe, you shall neuer retourne but if the deuyll bryng you for of fyfty messengers that the kyng of Esclardy hath sent thether, there is not one retourned agayne. Ualentyne harde him ryght well but he made no semblaunt but he sayd vnto himselfe, suche speaketh of the affayres that can not tel howe they go. So he toke his

waye and it was not longe but that he arryued within ynde, for he was nere the gate. And when he was pas sed a brydge he wende for to haue bene within the cytie, but or euer that he entred it behoued him for to passe fiue gates, whereof he was muche amarueylled. And by himselfe he began for to consyder the fortification of that same place, iudgyng by estymacion in his vnderstandyng that the same cytie was the moost strongest place that euer he hadde sene. And when he was in the market place he sawe a great toure muche hye and faire vpon the which stode a crosse, so Valentyne marueyled muche what it myght sygnifie, for he knewe well yt the paynims vsed not suche sygne nor suffred none. In that place the noble Ualentyne founde a Sarazyn too whome he demaunded the cause and the reason wherfore that crosse stode vpon that hye toure. Frende sayde the sarazyn knowe that the same toure that you se yonder is named the toure of saynt Thomas, & is the tour that he was stoned and put to death in. Nowe it is true that the christen men in the honour of the same that thei name to be a saint in this same place did foūd a church by the licence of the king, in the whiche churche is a patriarke and a hondred christen men, that in the maner of their lawe synge their seruyce euery day, and celebre masse. And in this wyse they are suffred to doo suche thynges; for they paye great trybute euery yeare vnto the kynge of ynde. ¶ When Valentyne vnderstode that in that toure there was mynister and habytacion of christen men, he descended of his horse for to go in to it and saye his prayers. So Ualentyne demaunded after the Patryarke the whiche came too hym incontynente and demaunded hym of whence he was, and on whom

he beleue. Syr sayd Ualentyne I beleue in Iesu christ Alas syr said the patriarke how haue you taken y• hardynes for to come hether, for and the kyng of ynde had knowledge of you he would make you dye shamefully. Father sayde Ualentine of that haue you no doubt, for I bryng him suche tydinges and sygnes that he wyll not doo nor thynke me no harme, but of one thynge I praye you, that is that you declare vnto me how and in what maner you abyde in this place and be founded. Certes sayd the patriarke we are foūded in the honour of god & of the holy saint Thomas the martyr, of whom the body is in this churche. And there may no christen men come hether but if thei be pilgrims, but such folke may come surely▪ because that the offrynges and oblacions that they gyue are the kynges. And more ouer it behoueth eche of vs to paye a great trybute. And then Ualentyne demaunded and required to se the holy body glorious, and it was shewed him in great reuerence and solempnite. ¶ Ualentyne kneled downe vpon his knees and made his prayers muche deuoutly vnto god & vnto the holy ma

By my fayth sayde the patriarke I haue hearde no tydinges of none. Then Ualentyne departed and enquyred no more for without makynge any noyse he would fynde some maner to heare tydynges of the fayre Clerymonde.

Thus aunswered the kyng Lucar that had a full sory harte, & not without a cause. And after wente towarde kynge

Brandyffer and sayd to hym in this maner. Syr sayde he I ought to haue lytel Joye of your doughter whan she hath accorded her to folowe myne enemye for to leue me & geue me a reprochable blame. Fayre sone sayd Brandiffer be not euyll contente agaynst me, for to day I shall auenge you on the traytour that had lede away my doughter. Then the kyng Brandyffer smote hys horse with the sporres for too rydeafter hym with a great companye of men, and among the other Ualentyne was there that would shewe his great promisse at that nede, and sayde vnto Pacolet, it is time for to play with thyne arte and shewe thy scyence. Then Pacolet made such a charme that it was aduyse vnto the kyng of Ynde that there was before his horse a fyeld full of chycke wodde and busshes, & great ryuers. So he had so great feare for to be taken that he made the lady for to descende for to flee the lightlier. And when the quene was on the earth she wende for to haue found the meanes to haue saued her with the kynge, but Ualentyne was nere that escryed vnto her.

Lucar and sayd to hym. Syr see here the fayre lady Rozemonde your wyfe that the false traytoure kynge of Ynde led away agaynst her wyl, the whyche is ryghte dyspleasaunt at her heart therfore. Ha syr sayd the lady he telleth you trouthe, for euen so as the batayll was begon I sawe hym come to warde me, soo I wende that it had ben one of your barons that dad comen for to socoure me. So I wente agaynst hym thyn kynge for to saue my selfe, and wythout enquyrynge of any thyng I moūted vpon hys hors, but alas, syr I knew anone his euyll wyll, and apperceyued well that I was vetrayed Than I pulled hym by the here and scratched hys face in suche wyse that the blode yssued out, and that it was force to hym to let me go downe, and so by the helpe of thys good knyght I haue saued me and escaped frome hym. Lady sayd kynge Lucar you haue wrought wel, and at this present tyme it behoueth to speake no more therof, for we haue the assaute by our enemyes that giueth vs to muche to doo. So he left the lady wythoute any more arguynge and returned into the vatayll. And at that houre they of Ynde returned in to the cyte, the whiche had loste diuers valyaunt champions, but aboue all the losses the kynge of Ynde complayned the losse of the fayre Rozemonde. ¶ Alas lady sayd he I haue well fayled at mine enterpryse, but eu

Ualentyne had great honoure of euery body bycause that he had delyuered the fayre Rozemōd, and recouered her of the kynge of Ynde. And she made hym fayre semblaunte bycause that he had socoured her

but what so meuer sygne of loue that she shewed hym, aboue all other she hated hym and would him euill, for she had well would that the thing had bene otherwyse but not for all that she helde her not contente with the firste faute, but watched and laboured soo muche that she brought her entencion vnto an ende, and her wyll vnto execution.

My lady nowe maye I at thys houre lede you surely at your owne wyll. In this maner he ledde her into the cyte of Ynde with great ioy Nowe was the crye amonge the hoost of kynge Lucar that the kynge of Ynde ledde away Rozemonde. Dyuers mounted on horsbacke for to socoure the lady, but they were anone entred into the cyte of Ynde. By mahowne sayd kynge Lucar who that may bryng me the lady agayne I shall make hym my greate Sene shall and aboue all them of my court mayster & gouernoure Syr sayd Pacolet vnto Ualentine yf it be your pleasure to haue the lady I shall fynde an enchaūtement anone wherby you shall take the lady.

On that same daye that the kynge of Ynde led away Rozemonde, he wedded her and laye wyth her, and engendren a sonne on her that was called Rabastre, the whyth posseded Jherusalem in his dayes To sorowfull was kynge Lucar whan he had lost his wyfe soo, And Brandyffer recomforted hym sayenge. Fayre sōne sayd he take courage vnto you, for I swere you mahowne and all my goddes that I shall auenge you or I departe hence. Soo swore Brandyffer but it wente otherwyse, for on that propre day there came a messenger vnto hym whyche sayd. Syre I brynge you tydynges whyche are ryght displeasaunt to you. Syr knowe that kyng Pepyn wyth the emperours sonne of grece is arryued in your lande and hath dystroyed castelles and townes, and hathe besyeged your fayre cyte of Angorye, in the whyche your wyfe is newly delyuered of a fayre sonne. And I am comen hether for to demaunde you socoure, or elles it behoueth to yelde youre fayre cyte of Angorye vnto the vnhappy chrysten men, whan brandyffer herde these tydynges he was muche sorowfull in hys heart. Than he wente towarde kyng Lucar and sayd vnto hym. Fayre sonne here is a messenger that hathe broughte me euyll tydynges out of my londe for the Frenchemen is entred in it wyth a greate puyssaunce and wasteth and dystroyeth my countree wherfore it is force vnto me that I goo and defende my countree, so I shall tell you what I shall doo. You shall sende some knyght vnto the kynge of Ynde and bydde hym that he sende you agayne my doughter Rozemonde youre wyfe vppon suche a condycyon that shall pardon hym the death of your father, and make your hoost

At these wordes he called Valentyne and sayde vnto him. Knyght it behoueth you to go towarde the kyng of Ynde on my behalfe and saye vnto hym in this maner, that he sende me agayne the fayre Rozemonde that he hathe taken frome me, vpon suche a couenaunt that I shall pardon him the death of my father without euer to haue any question therfore, and I shal make also my men & al mine hoost to auoide out of his lande without doyng him any dammage. Syr sayd Ualentyne for you I would auenture my body more then for any other, so I shall do your message the best wyse that I may, and within a shorte space you shall haue tydinges agayne. Than he mounted on horsbacke and went towarde Ynde, and entred into the cytie like a messenger, and went vnto the palais where as he found the kyng of Ynde & the quene Rozemonde syttyng besyde hym, the which knewe Ualentyne right well, so she sayde to the kyng. Syr se you hym yonder, it is the same that toke me from you the fyrste tyme that you would haue ledde me awaye. Lady sayde the king of Ynde at this houre I shall auenge me, for he shal neuer in his lyfe escape me. That shall he sayde the lady, for I knowe him of so muche that yet you maye haue good seruice of hym. Then Ualentyne approched with a hardy ha

And if thou wyll do it he will pardon you the death of his father, and shall make his armye to go out of your lande without any soiournyng, but notwithstandyng that I am charged for to do you this message, if you wil beleue me you shall neuer consent therto, but shall kepe the lady that is so fayre and that loueth you soo well. And knowe that neuer the dayes of my lyfe I shall bee in no place where as I shall suffer you to be blanted & dishonoured for the loue of the lady. And all the terme of my lyfe I shall serue you truely. Knyght sayde the kyng of Ynde you speake as valiaunt, & your wordes pleaseth me muche. But for a conclusion you shall saye vnto kyng Lucar that and he haue to do with wiues yt he seke other then my loue Rozemande, for he shall neuer the dayes of his lyfe sleepe by her sydes, nor haue pleasure of her body. Knyght sayd the lady salue my father and tell hym that of this dede he is the cause, for I had tolde himself that I would not be geuen vnto Lucar, now my father hath done agaynst my wyll, and I haue done agaynst his, so tell vnto Lucar that he haue no more trust in me. Lady sayd Valentyne I shall doo your message with good harte. Thus he toke leue right ioyous to be escaped from the kyng of Ynde and retorned vnto kyng Lucar and tolde him his aunswere saying.

Nowe I shall tell you sayde kynge Lucar howe you maye do for to saue youre honour and mine. I haue here a knyght named Valentyne aboue all other the moost valyaunt so you may geue hym youre men, for I haue founde hym true in all thynges. ¶ And moreouer you haue in this hoost your vncle Murgalant that of long tyme hathe folowed the warre and knoweth muche.

And you fayre vncle thynke for to doo well and it shall be rendred you. Fayre neuewe take no more thought for sythe that I leade with me the noble Ualentyne I make no doubte but that all shall be wel. after these thynges deuysed and ordeyned, there was geuen vnto Ualentyne and Murgalant a hondred thousande paynyms▪ and also many abode in the hoost of kyng Lucar. Ualentyne and Murgalant mounted vpō the sea and rowed soo muche that they arryued at the hauen of Angory. But a lytell whyle afore they arryued Ualentyne aduysed a toure couered with fyne laten, so he damaunded the maryners what place it was. Sir

sayd they it is the stronge castell, and wyte that it is a strong place and so subtylly composed at the entre that there can but one man passe at ones, for and if twaine would passe at ones they should fall in to the sea that beteth against the walles. And in that same castel king Brandiffer hath kept his doughter Galazye long time to the ende that she should not be stolen nor taken away of no body. For in the worlde is not memorye of a fayrer than she, but there is so muche that he wyll not geue her to no liuing creature. When Ualentyne harde those wordes, there toke hym a ryght great desyre for to go se the lady, and sayde to hymselfe that he shoulde neuer be Joyous tyll that he had sene her. Nowe are they aryued besyde Angorye and haue taken lande and sette forth their hoost in a short tyme. They sawe right well the tentes and pauilions of kynge Pepyn that were muche glystering and pleasaunt for to beholde. Great dyligence made the christen men for to assayl the cytie. But within was an admyrall named Bruhans the whiche yssued out euery day vpon king Pepin and did great prowesse with his men. When Murgalant aduised the hoost of the christē men that helde a great groūd he called Ualentyne and sayde to hym. Knyght counsayll vs vpō this feate, for I se & know that the christē men are strong and a great nombre. Murgalant sayde Ualentyne I shall tell you myne opynion. I counsayll that you sende a messenger a none in to the cytie of Angorye to specyfye to our men that we are aryued, & that they fayle not to morowe in the mornyng to yssue oute vpon the christen men and assaile them fyersly. And we shall assayll them vpon this syde towarde the sea so me thinketh yt they can not escape vs by no maner of wise

By my god sayd Murgalante you haue well aduysed. Nowe we muste fynde a messunger for to accomplysshe thys thynge.

Galant whether go you thus, it semeth by your maners that you are a spye. Lordes sayd Pacrlet you say trouthe, but I am not a spye for to bere you dōmage.

And of the greate payne and trouayll that he had or euer he myght ouer come the serpente, and also how he might here no tydynge of the same Clerymonde.  And syth tolde hym and declared vnto hym howe that they were aryued there for to fyght agaynst them

And are come hetherfor to chace you out of this countrey by the commaundement of kyng Lucar & kyng Brandiffer, but and you will beleue me, there shall not one of them retourne agayne. Frende sayde Orson for God haue regarde therto, for and you will do it neuer the dayes of your lyfe gate you so muche honoure, and shall acquyre merite to warde God.

But and euer I dyd you seruyce that pleased you I shall do one now Nowe herken how. It behoueth first that you kepe you vpon your garde, and that this nyght you make youre men to be armed and put in point. And to the ende that none thynke that Ualentyne hath wrought the creason I shall make hym to abyde in his tente, and shal make a great nombre of Satazyns to goo vnto the watche, and when this shal be thus done, I shall caste my charme in suche maner that they shall all sleepe, soo hadde that you maye passe them and enter in to the hoost surely in puttyng theym vnto death without any mercye. By God sayde Orson you speake ryght well and subtylly, and shewe well that you haue a good wil and deuocion for to susteyne and defende oure lawe. At these wordes Orson ledde hym towarde kyng Pepyn for to recounte hym the enterpryse. Ioyous and well content was kyng Pepyn to heare suche a thynge, and made Pacolet to be ryght hyghly fested. Pacolet eate and dronke and after toke leue and wente in to the cytie of Angorye to acheue his message, too the ende that none toke hede of his dede, and tolde to kyng Murgalant certayne sygnes. He entred in to the cytye and wente in to the palays where as he founde the admyrall bruhans and salued hym hyghly in great reuerence. After he did his message as he had in charge and commaundement by Murgalant. Syr sayd Pacolet know that of Brandyffers parte we are arryued a hondred thousand paynyms. So kynge Murgalant sendeth you worde that hath charge of all the paynyms, that to morowe be tymes

you make your men for to be armed and that you assayle the christen men on the syde of the cytie of Angorye, and Murgalant shall assayll theim on the other syde so that they shall not escape. Joyous was the admyrall Bruhans to here suche tydynges, but he knew not how it should happen him. Then Pacolet toke leue of hym in great reuerence and retourned vnto Murgalant, the whiche he salued from the Admall Bruhans in the maner as appertained. Frende said Murgalant you are worthy for to be praised when you can do your message so well. After Pacolet went to warde Ualentyne and sayd to hym secretly. Your brother Orson and your vncle the kyng Pepyn salueth you, to whome I haue lette wyte the enterpryse of your comyng, to the ende that thei be not taken vnwate, for it shold be great pytie and dammage. Frende sayd Ualentyne thou hast wrought tyght well. Nowe Pacolet tolde hym not the dede of his enterpryse, for he knew well that neuer the dayes of his lyfe he would do nor consence to creason. The nyght approched and behoued the watche to be set and the gardes of the hoost to be chosen & establysshed, wel would Ualentyne haue had the charge of the watche but Pacolet that knew well how the thing would go founde the meanes for to let hym and made hym for to abyde in the ten

Nowe the good kyng Pepyn slepte not nor his army, for when it came toward midnight hee entred into the hoost with thre score thousand fighting men and the noble Orson

and amonge the tentes and pauylions sette the fyre on euery syde, and all the paynyms put vnto death without sparyng lytle or great. They entted so ferre within the hoost or the paynyms a wakened that they came to the tente of Murgalant that slepte in his bedde and he was so surprysed that as he lepte out of his bedde he was smyten thorough the body with a darte and so fel downe dead to the earthe.

                  AFter that the cyte of Angory was taken by the chrysten men, & the paynyms dead as wel wythout as within. Ualentyne that founde the body of kinge Murgalant dead vpon the felde called Pacolet & sayd to him. Frende I wyl yt we bere this body with vs, so may kyng Brandyffer sooner beleue that we were in batayll togyther. Syr sayd pacolet you saye well & it shall be honour to you. Than Ualentyne made the body to be taken and put in a cofre muche honourably, and couered it wyth blacke. After they went vnto the porte where as theyr shyppes lay and mounted vpon thesee. But of a hundred thousand paynyms that were comen out there returned not ten thousande, and all throughe the subtyle of Pacolet. Now they are vpon thesee spreding theyr saylles and rowynge so muche that they arryued streyght at the hauen where as Brandyffer and Lucar had set theyr hoost. They toke londe and dyscended the body and charged it vpon two horses, and in makynge pyteous chere bare it vnto the pauylyon of kyng Brandyffer, the whyche played at the chesse wyth kynge Lucar accompanyed of fyftene kynges that behelde the play, and also soone as he sawe Ualentine he sayd vnto hym Knyght well be you comen now tel me of the batayll how it gothe, & yf you haue slayne all the chrysten men and taken the kynge Pepyn and hys neuewe Orson. Alas syr sayd Ualentyne it gothe well otherwyse, for we haue loste the felde, and all your men is slayne, for the kyng Faryn that had the charge of the watche lette hys men slepe, so the christen men passed forthe and put the fyre in the pauylyons in sleynge bothe lytle and great wythout any remyssyon. And whan I sawe that

the thynge wente so euyll I wakened also many men as I myght for to saue thē. And in thys batayll is dead your vncle kynge Murgalant, of whome I haue made the body to be brought to the end that it may be buryed as it appertayneth. And yf you wyll not beleue me you maye demaunde the other that be here howe the thynge wente. ¶ Syr sayd the other he telleth you trouthe.
               Than arose the kyng Brandyffer, and as all in a rage hurled the chesse vnto the erthe, and was so sorowful yt wyth payne he myght speke a worde. Ha Ualentyne I knowe well that thou haste made my men to dye. By god sayd valentyne it is euyll spoken, for I was neuer in my lyfe suche as you saye. And yf ony wyll maynteyne it I wyl fyght wyth him for it in a felde. By mahoune sayd kynge Lucar of him it nedeth not to doubte, for and he hadde wylled for to haue done treason he wolde not haue returned to you agayne. Thā brandyffer was styll and made the body of hys vncle to be honourablye buryed. And anone they of the cyte knewe the tydynges wherof they were muche Joyous. Than the kynge of Ynde made hys men to be armed lyghtly and wyth forty thousande men yssued out of the cyte of Ynde. Whan Brandyffer knewe that they came agaynst hym he made his men to arme them. So it was not longe but that the bataylles assembled that was muche fyerse on eche sayde. Ualentine was amongest the prese that on euery sayd smote and caste downe folkes, so that none durste abyde afore hym. His hardynes was so redoubted that

that he had no streyngth nor force for to ryse vp. Whan Pacolet sawe that he was downe he went anone with dyuers other and toke the kynge of Ynde & yelded hym vnto Ualentyne the whyche ledde hym vnto the pauylyon of kynge Brandyffer. And whan he knew the tydynges that Ualentyne had taken the kynge of Ynde, he cryed vpon hys men sayenge. Now to it lordes there is but to do well, for to day we shall haue vyctorye vpon our enemyes. Soo I swere my god mahowne that neuer the dayes of my lyfe I shal fayle the knyght Ualentyne neyther wyth body nor wyth goodes. For these tydinges kynge Lucar and all his men toke great courage, and put them in the batayll more fyerslye that before, in suche maner that there abode mo than thyrtye thousande vpon the felde. Whan the Marshall of Ynde knewe the losse that they had, he made anone to blowe the retrette to wythdrawe them and assemble hys men, whan Brandyffer and kyng Lucar sawe yt they wyth drewe them they pursued them so nere that at the entre of the cyte there dyed ten thousande. Pacolet was moche Joyous for to se so many paynyms dye. For he cared not on what syde the losse turned, so that he & Ualentyne myght escape out of theyr handes. The batayll endured so longe that the nyght approched, and Brandyffer and kynge Lucar returned into theyr tentes and pauylyons and badde that they should bryng them the kynge of Ynde, the whyche was presented vnto theim anone. Whan kyng Lucar sawe hym he sayd vnto hym all on hye. Ha false toaytoure nowe is the tyme comen that thou shall rendre me acountes, thou mayst be well sure that thou shall neuer escape me, for I shall make the dye shamefully. The kynge of Ynde vnderstode him

                   of Fraunce and Emperoures of Rome wythout contradyccyon, for there is nothyng in thys worlde that I desyre so muche. Brother sayd henry you speke wysely, but it must be well aduysed howe suche a thyng may be accomplysshed and perfourmed. Henry sayd Haufray I shall tell you how. I muste go towarde the kyng Brandyffer and accorde thys thyng wyth hym, by thus that he shall gyue me hys doughter Galazye, and I shall tell hym the tydynges how kyng Pepyn and the twelue peres of Fraunce go vnto the holy sepulcre, and how they maye be lyghtly taken for they go wythouten armoure and wyth a small company. And I am well certayne yt the paynyms shall be ryght Joyous of these tydynges And yf that they be not thus taken they shall neuer be taken. By god Haufray sayd Henry you saye trouthe-Nowe you muste go to warde Ynde the may our & there you shal fynde kynge Lucar and the kynge Brandyffer the whyche holdeth the cyte assyeged, so you may saye & tell them your courage, and I shall go wyth the kyng on vyage, to the ende that our feate be the more secretely couered, and that they apperceyue nor deme no treason. It is well sayd quod Haufray, so let me accomplysshe it. For I shall neuer haue good rest tyll that I haue accomplysshed thys thynge. And thus was the treason made and conspyred by the two fals brethren Haufray and Henry agaynst theyr propre father kynge Pepyn. Alas they shewed well that they were euylly begoten and engendred, and comen of an vntrue generacyon, whan they wolde make hym dye that was theyr father,

and that withall his puyssaunce toke payne for to conquere them realmes. No we the kyng Pepyn and the twelue peres of Fraūce are entred in to the sea that doubted of no treason for to accomplishe their pylgrymage. Henry is entred in with theim for to hyde their treason the better. And his brother Haufray wente towarde Ynde for to synde kyng Brandyffer that hadde set the syege afore the cytie of Ynde with kyng Lucat for his doughter Rozemonde.

                  HEre wyl I make you mencion of the fayre Clerimonde the whyche as you haue herde before was kept in the kyng of Yndes palays. Now the kynge of Ynde had a custome yt he wolde sende her of the best meat that was on hys table. So it happened that at a souper he called Popyn and gaue hym the meat that was before hym and sayd vnto hym. Go in to the chambre where as is a wyndowne, & there you shall fynde a folysshe woman pyteously arayed, bere her thys from me. Pepyn toke the meat and bare it, vnto the lady. But whan he sawe her so poorely arayed he had great pyte & sayd vnto her. Loue Jhesus that suffered for vs death & passyon helpe you. Alas haue truste in hym and serue hym wyth good heart, and yf you do so knowe for a certaynte that you, shall haue aledgement of your doloure / and therfore beleue stedfastly in hym & receyue the holye sacrament of baptym. Whan the lady vnderstode that he spake of god she approched nere hym and sayd. Frende haue noo doubte of me. But tell me yf thou be a christen man or yf you saye these wordes by gyle Lady sayd pepyn for a trouthe I am a chrysten man, and am comen out of the realme of Fraunce. Thā the lady sayd al smylynge you ought well to knowe the good kyng Pepyn and his neuewe Ualentyne. It is true sayd Pepyn and I knowe well hys brother Orson & his father the Emperoure of Grece also whan the lady herde that she began for to wepe and said vnto him. Alas frende may I haue truste in you. Ye sayd Pepyn as muche as in your propre father of all that it shal please you for to say▪ for neuer shall you be accused by me. ¶ Frende sayd the lady knowe for a certaynte that I counterfee the foole, and

the seke woman, but I am also wyse and hole as I was euer, for I am a chrysten woman and had the fayre Ualentyne vnto loue, and vnto hym I was gyuen for wyfe, but by the false traytour kyng Trompart I was taken from hym. Than the lady tolde hym all the maner of her estate, and how she had ben stolen, and wherfore she made her selfe syke. Whan kyng pypyn herd the pyteous aduenture of the lady he began for to wepe muche tenderly. After in consyderyng the fortunes and great aduentures that cometh vpon the creature in castynge out great teares he sayd softly to hymselfe. Ha veray god almyghty what is it of the tenebres of thys worlde nowse I thys poore sorowfull for to kepe her trouthe myserably aourned, and in greate pacyence vsynge her dayes. Alas Ualentyne my fayre neuewe at thys tyme it nedeth not to demaunde yf for this fayre lady you are and haue ben syth in languysshynge pacyence and in great thought. Now pleased it god that you knewe at this hour how I fynde her that for your heart languyssheth. And after these wordes he behelde the lady sayenge. Lady I knowe certaynly what you are & you wote not what I am, but syth that you haue hadde soo muche truste in me that you haue tolde me your secrete I wyll tell you what I am. ¶ Knowe that suche as you se me I am Pepyn the kynge of Fraunce to whome fortune hathe ben so contraryous that she hath made me to fal into suche pouerte and seruitude as you see. Nowe I knowe well that my neuewe Ualentyne in greate trauayll of his body without reste sercheth you continually. But and it please god he shal haue tydynges of you shortly, and in ioye and solace you shal assemble agayn togyther. At these wordes the lady

                  VOu haue heard of kynge Brandyffer that had the twelue peres of Fraunce prysoners, and Haufray and Henry, so he dyd so much that he came vnto the stronge castell. Brandyffer founde there his doughter Galazye, that he loued so muche. And recounted vnto her the enterpryse and maner, & after put them all in a depec

where as the Emperour of Grece was and the Grene knyght, so the traytour Haufray had bene put in vnto them. Muche sorowful was Henry when hemight not tell his courage vnto Brandiffer, but he was the first that was letten downe in to the pryson, and after hym the duke Myllon that fel vpon Haufray, wherof Haufray complayned sore because that he was hurt. Holde your peace sayd the duke Myllon and drawe you more lower, for there is many moo to whome it behoueth to make place▪ Haufray vnderstode the duke Millon wel and demaūded him what brought him thether, but you sayd the duke Myllon, for I had lefte you within Angorye. Ha sayd the traytour I was taken at a stoure ye other daye and brought hether. So the lordes be in pryson making much sorowe the whiche knew eche other when Haufray knew that king Pepyn was not there he made the semblaunt to be ryght Joyous, but he had well woulde that he had bene hanged by the necke. It is not to be demaunded of the tetes and lamentacions that they made, for there was none but that thei trusted better to dye then to lyue, saue Orson that comforted them & sayde. Lordes take weit in pacience for it pleaseth God that it shall be thus. And that in this maner we do our penaunce. But that notwithstanding discō
                  forte you not al out, but haue trust in god & in our good frendes, that is my brother Ualentyne and the noble Pacolet that can play so wel with his art. Thus spake Orson, but he knew not that the castel was so strong that it myght not be taken by enchauntemente. After that Brandyffer had put the lordes in prison, he called his doughter Galazye and sayd vnto her. ¶ It is true that I wyll go in to Falezye for to assemble myne hoost

And there I ought to fynde the kynge of Ynde and Lucar, the whiche come with me in to Angorye, that the Frenchemen holde. wherfore gouerne you well, and aboue all take kepe vnto the prysoners. Father sayd the mayden of me haue no doubte nor of the prysoners, for you shall here but good tydynges. So Brandyffer departed from the strong castell and went vnto Faleyze where as he assembled his hoost. Theder came kynge Lucar with a great puyssaunce but the kynge of Ynde sene his men alonely, for his wyfe Rozemonde was sycke and dyed within nyne dayes after, wherfore the kyng toke suche soro we that he laye twelue dayes in his bedde without speche, whereof kynge Lucar was ryght gladde.
            
            
               ¶ How Brandyffer after that he hadde assembled his hoost mounted on the sea and wente and besyeged the cytie of Angorye. Capit. xciii.
               
                  
               
               
                  
                  AFter that Brādiffer and Lucar hadde assembled their hoost ac Faleyze, without soiournyng they mounted vpon the sea, and had so good wynde that they arryued anone at the porte. And when they were arryued, they that sawe them take lande ranne towarde Angotye and tolde it to Ualentyne that kepte the cytye in abydyng the comyng of kyng Pepyn and of the twelue prres of Fraunce. Alas he knewe not howe the game went. when he sawe the tentes and pauylions reysed vp about Angorye, he bewaylled kyng Pepyn muche pyteously and called Pacolet saying to hym. Frende to euyll goeth our feate whan I can haue no tydynges of kyng Pepyn. Nowe let me alone sayde Pacolet for we shall haue tydynges anone. without saying any other thynge vpon the moro we in the mornyng he departed from Angorye and went thoroughe the hoost of the paynyms tyll that he came vnto the tente of kyng Lucar. And when kyng Lucar sawe hym he demaunded him. Frende where is your maister that serued me other tymes. Ha syr sayd Pacolet he is dead long a goo, and I am lefte alone. I would gladly fynde a maister. Uarlet sayde kynge Lucar I wyll well retayne you and guerdone you if you serue me well. Yes sayd Pacolet I demaunde none other thyng. Pacolet abode in the seruyce of Lucar, but he serued hym euyll, and euyll was he rewarded. Anone after that it was nyghte he made an enchauntement that caused Lucar to sleepe, and mounted hym vpon a horse, and without wakening led him in to the cytie of Angorye in to the palayd. Ualentyne was muche ioyous when he sawe Lucar. ¶ Now he was brought in to the palays before a fayre fyre, and at

that houre the charme fayled. So Lucar dyd awaken all afrayed for to finde him there, and Pacoiet that was euyll auy sed put him before hym and sayd. Fayre mayster I am your seruaunt pleaseth it you to commaunde me any thynge. Than he knewe that he was betrayed and tooke a poynted knyfe and smote Pacolet in suche wyse that he fell downe dead. Soo it neth not 
                     •
                  o aske the great sorowe that Ualentyne made than. And sayd srende nowe are you fynysshed. I may well say that I shal neuer haue suche a frende. Now am I at al poyntes sorowfull and left alone in dystresse, ferre from my frendes and nere myne enemyes. Alas fre kyng Pepyn wherfore come you not, your longe abydynge shall bere you great dommage. Ha false Lucar thou hast slayne hym that was my hope, by Jhesus thou shalt abyedere. By mahowne sayd Lucar I care not for noo more syth that I am auenged on hym that hath betray me falsly. Than Ualentyne wente towarde Pacolet and tooke hys tables that were in his bosome, in whych was wryten all the secretes of hys arte. And Pacolet had tolde hym longe before that he should take the tables whan that he was dead yf that he lyued after hym and that all hys scyence was wrytten therin that he played with and so dyd Ualentyne, and putte them vp, the whyche dyd him good seruyse afterwarde. At that hour wolde Ualentyne that Lucar hadde bene Judged vnto death. But it was auysed by the lordes that was wyth hym that he should be put in a toure and kepte surely to the ende that and any noble man of theyr party were taken prysoner by the paynyms, that he myght be yelded agayne for the chaunge of kynge Lucar. Thus counsayll pleased euery bodye and soo it was accorded entyerly.

And when Lucar was in pryson Ualentyne made the body of Pacolet to be buried ryght honourably that of lytell and great was muche be wayled.
            
            
               
                  ❧ Howe Brandiffer knewe that Lucar was in Angory. And sent vnto Ualentyne for to make the appoyntement to bye hym agayne. Capit. xciiii.
               
                  ON the mornyng by tymes there was great noyse and crye in the hoost of the paynyms for the kyng Lucar that they had lost, and aboue al the other. Brandiffer made great sorowe, and euen soo as he asked for hym there aryued a spye that tolde hym how he was in Angorye and that he had slayne Pacolet, Brandiffer was ioyous for the death of Pacolet, and sorowfull at his harte for the takyng of Lucar. So he called a messenger and badde hym go vnto Ualentyne and aske hym if he woulde geue him kyng Lucar for kyng Pepyn▪ or the Emperoure of Grece or his sone Orson▪ or some of the other twelue petes of Fraunce, whiche he loueth beste. Syr sayde the messenger I shall do your message well. So he went towarde Angorye and entred in saying that he would speake with Ualentine. And he was brought unto hym anone. When he was before hym he salued hym highly, and after tolde him his message as Brandiffer had bydden hym all alonge. When Ualentyne harde that he was muche amarueyled & sayd vnto the messenger of Brandiffer. ¶ God almyghty how maye that be that kyng Brandiffer holdeth in pryson

so many valyaunt men, and howe maye he haue taken them prysoners.

               Syr sayde the messenger it is true that the kynge Pepyn not longe ago accompanied of the twelue peres of Fraunce, of Orson and of Henry wente vnto

Jerusalem, so the tydynges by a tràytour came vnto the kynge Brandyffer of whyche he was muche Ioyous. And he ledde suche a puyssaunce thether that they were taken wythin Iherusalem, and hathe sente them into the stronge castell that is the strongest place of all the worlde. Sy gyue me an answere shortly yf you wyl chaūge kyng Lucar for one of your good trendes. Messenger sayd Ualentine you shal haue an answere anon And than he entred into a halle and assembled all the lordes & sayd vnto them. Frendes it is true that for the rendrynge of Lucar I may delyuer of the prysoners of Brandiffer my father or my brother Orson, or myn vncle the kynge pepyn that are my thre pryncypall frendes, so counsell me whyche I ought to demaunde. Syr answered the barons here auayleth nothynge the dreamynge, frr you knowe that none maye be more beholden than vnto father and mother, and by ryght reason and naturall loue you ought to demannde pout father. Lordes sayd Ualentyne you speke wysely, but sauynge your reuerences I am delybered for to doo otherwyse. For to speake of this thynge Iustely and after the true equyte you knowe al that my mother Bellyssant by my father wyth great wronge was banysshed shamefully out of hys countree. And in suchenecessyte & peryl childed me in the forest of Orleaunce, and there I should haue ben deuoured by wylde beastes yf myne vncle kynge pepyn hadde

And therfore I wyl that mine vncle

Than Ualentyne sayd vnto the messenger Frende thou shalt retourne towarde the kyng Brandiffer thy mayster, and tell hym the aunswere that I shall geue the, that is that I shall yelde hym the kyng Lucar vpon suche a condicion that he shall delyuer me kynge Pepyn of Fraunce, for I wyll haue none other for the chaunge of kyng Lucar. Than departed the messenger and tolde his aunswere vnto kyng Brandiffer as Ualentyne hadde bydden hym.

                  Ryght so as the kyng Brandyffer knew that Ualentyne would haue the kyng of Fraūce for kyng Lucar, he sent messengers anone vnto the strong castell towarde his doughter Galazye, byddynge that she shoulde geue them the kynge of Fraunce all alone. The messengers mounted vpon the sea, and rowed so muche that within a short space they arryued at the strong castell, and recounted vnto the fayre Galyzye their message. When the mayden knewe it she was ready anone to fulfyll the wyll of her father. So she called the gayler and sent hym too the pryson to demaunde the kynge of Fraunce. And when he came to the dore of the pryson he cryed on hye

Nowe come hether the kyng of Fraunce for

                   it behoueth me to delpuer hym. And whan the duke Myllon vnderstode the gayler, he answered swetely. Alas frend I am here, wherfore cal you me. If I must dye the first I praye to God that he wyll haue mercye on me, for I wyll offre my body vnto death with a good harte for to susteyne the holy fayth. Syr sayd the gayler haue no doubte, for you shall be delyuered in the chaunge of a paynem kyng that they of your lawe holdeth. Whan Henry vnderstode those wordes he repented hym that he had gainsayde the king his father, and that he made hym not the kyng of Fraunce when he was requyred. But the vntrue chylde that knewe the treason thought not that his father should haue escaped, but he knewe well his vnhappy wil when he sawe the duke Myllon deliuered by suche meanes, the whiche in wepyng toke leue of the other barons. Alas sayde the emperoure of Grece salue me aboue all my chylde Valentyne, and me also sayd Orson and recommaunde me vnto hym & tell hym howe we are here in mysetable dystresse, and in great pouerte, & if by hym we haue not succour shortly, it behoueth vs to fynyshe our dayes. Lordes sayde Myllon take comfort vnto you, for if it please Jhesus I shall neuer retourne in to Fraunce til that you be delyuered. Than he departed from the pryson, and all the other abode wepyng full tenderly. when he was oute as wyse & well taught he went towarde the fayre Galazye and toke leue of her in muche great reuerence, the lady was curteyse and amiable & recommaunded hym vnto her god mahoune. So departed the duke Myllon and the messengers that were come for hym ledde him to the hauen. After they mounted vpon the sea, and in

shorte tyme arryued in the hoost of Brandyffer. Than when Brandiffer sawe him he sayd vnto him. Freking well may you be come you knowe well ynough wherfore I haue sente for you. Go with my men that haue brought you hetherin to the cytie of Angory and saye vnto Ualentyne that in chaunge of you he geue me Lucar as we haue appoynted. Syr sayd the ouke Millon so will I doo and holde you suche loyalte that & for me he wyll not geue you Lucar I shall come and yelde me vnto you to do with me as you dyd before. By mahoune said Brandyffer you speake rially, and I demaunde no more of you. Nowe go vnto mahoune the whiche conduyte you. Thus departed Myllon dangler & they that ledde hym. Soo they arryued at Angorye & entred in without any refuse and went in to the palays where as they founde Valentyne. Then he and the duke Myllon embraced swetely eche other. And the duke Myllon toke hym asyde and recounted to hym howe they were taken wichin Jerusalem, and howe the kynge of ynde had ledde kyng Pepyn away without knowyng hym, and also how he had chaunged his name at the request of kyng Pepyn, and tolde hym howe the other were in pryson in the strong castell. Whan Valentyne vnderstoode hym he sayde vnto hym swetely. Will haue you wrought for I knowe that you did it for good, & good is happened you, for too daye you are delyuered from your enemyes by the true saruyce yt you dyd vnto king Pepyn. You shewed you a good frende whan you dyd chaunge your name for to saue kyng Pepyn. And also so one myght you haue hadde dammage as proffyte for of nature the false paynims desired the death of kynge Pepyn, because that he susteyneth the faythe of Jhesu

christe against them, and destroyeth that of maboune. when Ualentyne had spoken so he made to bryng forth the kyng Lucar and sayde to hym. Lucar for this tyme you are delyuered, but kepe you from me the tyme to come, and thynke vpon my frende Pacolet that you haue slayne. For by God if euer I recountre you in batail or elles where we shal se whiche of vs twayne shall be the more valiaunter. At these wordes departed the kyng Lucar that was ryght ioyous for to escape. And whan he was without the gates sarazins came against hym with a great puyssaunce makyng great ioye for his delyueraunce. Thus was the kyng Lucar delyuered, and the duke Myllon yelded vnto Ualentyne. A

                   none as the duke Myllon was within with Ualētyne, they made no great so iournyng, but ordeyned their bataylles, and with fyftye thousand men yssued oute in displaying their baners and standardes. And whan Brandiffer vnderstode those tidinges he made to blow his trompettes and clarons, and ordeyned his batailes too the nombre of foure and twenty. And when they were ordeyned he yede for the accompanied with foure and twenty kynges all holding of him, and the christen men approched nere for too smyte vpon them, but they were so thicke that they might not entre.

Christians assaylled and sarazyns defended them. About their standarde was fyfty thousande men that helde before them great targes, wherfore the christen men myght not greue them. Than an admyrall lorde of cassydoyne sawe a Frencheman that put dyuers paynyms vnto death, he went thederwarde & with an axe he gaue him suche a stroke that he smote his head in two, but before hys retorne a squyer of Normandye aryued vpon the Admyrall & afore Myllon dangler smote him down dead And for that valiauntnes Myllon made him knyght

And sayd now thynke for to do well, for there shall not be so poore a man yt he beare hym valyaunt but that he shall be made knyght to day. He made so many that day that euerybody toke payne for to be made one. And in thys maner the batayll endured so longe that the sunne began for to derken. But for asmuche as the christē men sawe that the paynyms wolde wythdrawe them. Ualentyne wolde not wythdrawe hym. Well wende the sarazyns to haue returned in to theyr pauylyons, but ye christen men were before them, wherof Brandyffer & kynge Lucar were muche ameruayled. Al the nyght dured the batayll ryght mortall, there was greate fyres on euery syde. And the daye was cleare the stoure began more stronger than before. There was so many slayne that the bloodran lyke chanelles It nedeth not to demaunde of the prowesse that Ualentyne dyd, for in the thyckest of the prese he put hym maugre the sarazyns, and the duke Myllon after. ¶ Ualentyne on euery syde smote downe horses and men, so many that there was no paynym that durst abyde before hym. And he entred in soo ferr that he came nere the standarde of Brandyffer, and there he sawe the admyrall of Ynde the whyche came agaynst hym so rudely that he slewe his hors vnder hym. But Valentyne that was lyght rose vpon his feete anone and toke hys swerde and slewe sarazyns on euery syde in cryenge hyghly saynt George, and reclaymynge God. But he had neuer escaped yf it hadde not ben the Duke Myllon that departed paynyms as the wo

                  ffe dothe the shepe, and smote all downe that he founde before hym, and soo socoured hym and gaue hym a hors. Whan Valentyne was remounted he wythdrewe hym out of the battayll for to take ayre and dranke ones and

after retourned into the stoure more strouger than before. And whan the Marshall of Ynde sawe that they had the worse, the moost secretly that he might he made his men to withdrawe them into a lytell valeye for to stele awaye the better. Ualentyne sawe it well and shewed it vnto duke Myllon. That it was appoynted that Ualentyne and his men should go vpon the sayde Marshall without makyng any noyse, and too it was done. Ualentyne and his man went thederwarde and smote vpon the Yndyans in suche maner that at their first entring they broke their batayll. Then Ualentyne espied the Marshall that thought for to haue saued himselfe; and gaue him so great a stroke with his spere that he smote both horse and man to the earth, and the christen men smote vpon him, but he was soo well armed they slewe him not at the first brunte. And than Ualentyne toke him and gaue him to kepe to foute knightes, and the Yndians were discomfyted at that houre by Valentyne. And it waas the first batayll that was discomfyted that daye. There was many riche prisoners taken the whiche Valētine sent in to Angory commaū
                  ding that they should be well kept. Now Brandiffer & Lucar knewe that they had the worse. By mahoune saide Brandiffer I can not auyse howe we may resiste so I fere me sore that we must all dye here, wherfore I am of the opinion that we holde vs content for this time, and recourne in to our countreis, and we maye retourne an other time with greater strengthe. By mahoune said Lucar you saye truthe, for we haue loste already the moost part of our men retourne we without abiding any lenger here. For it is better to fle betymes than to abyde to longe and dye. Thus was the coūsail

taken by them, and made the standarde and the baner to be wounde vp, and sayde vnto their men saue you & you maye. The paynims toke their flighte towarde the hauen of the sea. And the christen men went after sleing and kylling without any remission, for men that are in flyght are halfe discomfyted. And there abode so many paynims vpon the fielde, that there mounted with Brandiffer & Lucat but a hondred at their recourning And after the discomfiture of the paynims and sarazyns the christen men entred in to their tentes where as they founde great rychesses, and after they wente into Angory for to reste them, for they were were and trauayled. Upon the morowe they made the dead bodyes to be buryed.

Ualentyne mounted vp in to the palays and commaunded that the prysoners should be brought before hym. Than was brought before hym the Marshall of the kyng of Ynde to whom he demaūded if he would beleue in Jhesu. By mahoune sayde the Marshall I had leuer dye.

Well haue we wrought sythe that we haue taken this paynim, for by him we may haue the kyng Pepyn that the kyng of Ynde ledde awaye for ad werfe whan we were taken within Jerusalem. Myllon sayd Ualentyne you saye trouth. Then he demaunded the paynim if the kynge of Ynde helde not in his prysons a chrysten man of lytell stature. By mahowne said the Marshall in the pryson of the kynge of Ynde is no christen man, but in his courte there is a lytell one that rydeth with him and is not in pryson. And he brought hym from Jerusalem whan the twelue peres was taken. Marshall said Ualentine it is the same that we demaunde, and if you maie do so muche that he be brought vnto me, you shall be delyuered for him without raunsome, for he is my page, and hath serued me long tyme. Ha sayde the paynim I am agreed, and was ryght ioyous of those tydynges. So he wrote a lettre anone and sente it vnto the kynge of Ynde.

And therfore and you can helpe her I shall gyue you more than you wyll demaunde. Ualentyne sayd I shall doo it well, but the malady is euyll for to heale syth that she hath had it so longe.

So it is not to be demaunded the ioye that they made. They passed the nyght and dronke good wyne that recomforted them muche.

Lordes sayde Haufray speke no more, for we are delybered for to retorne in to Fraunce to serue our father. By my faith said Orsō we ought not to wepe for your departing, for you were neuer yet good, who that leseth euill company he ought to thanke god, and I know by experience that you are men that by nature demaūdeth not but treason. Haufray & Henry had grea dispite of those wordes, but force constrayned them to haue pacience, for they were not men to saye the contrary. ¶ It was apointed at the last that the Emperour that was alredy auncient and had nede of reste with his sone Orson and the grene knyght should abyde in garnyson in the strong castel, & Ualentine with all the other should retourne in to Angorye. ¶ Here wyll I tell you of the two traitours Haufray and Henry that retourned into Fraunce, the whiche haue conspired the death of their father with that of lytell Charles and the quene Berthes. Now they haue ryden so muche that they are arryued at Parys & mounted vp in to the palays where as they saluted the king & al the barōs. The king made them chere and after demaunded them tydinges of the Emperoure of Grece, of Ualentyne and of Orson, and of the twelue peres and the other lordes. Syr sayde the traytours praye for them, for they haue bene slayne in a great batayll before Angory. whan the kynge vnderstode

these tydinges he wepte tenderly in bewayling the lordes that he wende had bene dead. But the traytours dyd it for to angre the kyng, the whiche purchased his death at the laste and that of the quene Berthes fyrst of all. And because that they myght not well poyson her they acquainted them with a damosel that was nyght and day with the quene, and they gaue her such a gyfte that the false woman consented to the death of the quene that had done her so muche good, so that with in fyftene dayes she dyed, wherof the kyng Pepyn was so sorowefull that he abode in his bedde.

Than the kynge of Sury dyd so and sent. viii. hundred men armed to the good patryarke, the whyche shewed them the lodgys at the kynges cōmaundement. The paynyms went thyther anone and founde Orson and the grene knyght at dynner▪ the whyche they tooke and bounde straytely, and in betynge theym ledde them towarde the kynge.

                  NOwe Galeran dyd so muche that he arryued in Constantynoble at the houre of dynor and salued the ladyes from the Emperour Orson and the grene knyght, and after he gaue theym the letters. Messenger sayd Bellyssant what doth my sonne. Ladye sayd Galeran I lefte hym in Jherusalem safe and sounde, soo you may knowe by this letters more certayuly of hys dedes The ladyes commaunded that the messenger should be

feested. Now it was of custome that whan they wolde dyne or soupe, they made Ualentyne to be brought into the Halle for to nourysshe hym the better, and because that he knew that he eate but leuinges, they gaue hym 
                     •
                  o good that he wold vse no more thereof, but often toke that which they cast vnto the dogges, and than they cast the dogges largely. He herde well the ridinges of the messengers so he thought what he shold do. The ladies rose vp from the tables, & whan graces was said Bellyssant made a secret aye to come that redde the letters and tolde them the tenoure of them both. And valentyne herde it well the which was in the halle but he made no semblaunt. So it is not to be demaunded the great sorowes and lamentacions of the ladies yt was made for Ualentyne that they maunded was deed, for they knew the seales of the good knyghtes. The fayre Clerimonde rente her clothes a pulled her heere saying Poore woman aboue all other moost colorous wherfore cometh not the death and take the. Alas Ualentyne wherfore am I not gone with you for to ese your body Broder greue knight and you Emperour Orson you haue to harde courages that wyll marye me so soone. Alas how ought she euer to take a husband that of the valyauntes hathe loste his excellente of good the beste, of worthy the moste hardy, the rose of honour, the floure of chyualry of noble the myrroure, ye example of curteyse, of trouth the patron, & of wyse the chosen. False dethe what hast thou thought whan by yt I am oute of all humayne Joye▪ neuer in my lyfe I require to haue myrthe, but alwayes in languysshynge be wayle hym yt of al ye humaynes is worthy honour. I shal neuer in my life haue other husband, but in continuall sorowes

shall vse my dayes. Well sawe Valentyne the great doloure that Clerymonde bare for hym, wherof he hadde great p

                  te, but for doubte of knowyng he bare it in his heart. ¶ And whan Bellyssant sawe that Clerymonde dis

                  e, you knowe that he was my sonne so I ought to be sorowfull at the heart, but whan I consider that there is no remedye, it is better praye for hys soule than wepe so muche, so thinke on that which your brother and the Emperour Orson maundeth you. Alas sayd Clerymonde wherof speke you to me, what maryage maye they make of her that trusteth neuer to haue Joye. Lady for god speake no more therof for I wyl neuer haue no husbande. Doughter sayd Bellyssant you are euyll auysed, for syth that so hyghe a man as kynge Hugon wyll haue you, you shall be neuer the more praysed. And I tell you well that there maye suche one come ye that I shall mary me. At these wordes the fayre Clerimonde entred in to her chambre sore wepynge. And Valentyne is vnder the stayres that thinketh in hys heart from whens suche treason may come. So it happened at the ende of foure dayes that kynge Hugon arryued in Constantynoble, and was receyued in grett honoure, but the fayre clerymonde made hym no semblaūt of loue. My lady sayd he you haue wel heard how your sonne is dead wherof I am sory. So it is accorded that I shall haue Clerymonde vnto wyfe. Syr sayd Clerymonde I haue no wyl to wedde you nor none other. Ualentyne heard all this treason. So the thynge was soo moche pleded that we accorded at the laste to haue the kyng Hugon, wherof he was muche Joyous but it dured not longe.

                  UAlentyne had greate pite on his loue yt they were about to betraye, so he entred into a chapel of our lady where as he was accustomed for to pray to God, and kneled downe before the ymage of the vyrgyn Marye & sayd▪ Blessed vyrgyn Marye▪ I beseche the praye thy dere sonne to defend my loue clerymond from this treason that is made agaynst her. And or he had ended his prayer an asigell sayd vnto him. Ualentyne God hathe herde thy prayer, go out of the cyte and take the habytes

of a pylgrym that thou shalt fynde there, and after retourne in to thy palais and recounte before all the cō pany ye treason suche as thou knowest it, for thou shalt not be knowen. Uetay God sayde Valentyne I thanke you. Than he departed and founde the pylgrym and toke his habytes, after he retorned in to the palays where as the ladyes were and the traytout Hugon that spake dyuers fayned wordes vnto the fayre Clerymonde.
               He salued all the company and after sayd all on hyghe to the Empresse Bellyssant. Lady I beseche you humbly that you wil shewe me the wyfe of Ualentine. Pilgrym sayd Hugon that chaunged coloure, go in to the kechyn and there thou shalt haue thyne almesse. Syr sayd Ualentyne I will do a message vnto her. Pylgrim sayd the lady I am she that you demaunde. My lady in a good houre said he. I haue sene your loue that salueth you by me, & letteth you wy

Lady sayd Ualentyne you ought not to beleue it, for I deliuer me vnto death if he bee not yet on lyue, and that thou shalt se him within thre dayes▪ Whā Hugon herde the wordes that Ualentyne tolde vnto ye ladyes, he yssued secretly out of the palays and mounted vpō the horse without retourning. The ladies were to muche amarueiled and woulde haue feasted the pylgrym. But he would do nothing and said to them. My ladyes pardon me, for I haue my felowes in the towne whiche I wil go se. Than Clerimonde gaue him much money the which he distrybuted afterwarde to the poore folkes. Than she was out they demaunded where the kyng Hugon was. By fayth sayd a damosell I sawe

hym renne presently vnto his horse. And vpon these wordes Galeran entred that demaunded after his vncle. By God sayde Bellyssant in a good houre are you come, for you shall neuer escape till that you haue tolde the treason that your vncle hath made. And whan Galeran herde these wordes be began for to tremble. Was lady sayde he for God haue mercy on me and I shal tel you all, saye on I pardon the. It is true that mine vncle Kynge Hugon hath d

                  one this treason, and solde vnto the paynims within Jherusalem the Emperour Orson and the grene knight. After he recounted to her▪ all alonge as you haue herde before. There was made a meruaylous sorow, so whan Galeran had told all, he departed thinking to haue escaped, but the prouost made him to be hāged and strangled. And Valentine lefte the pilgrimes gowne and toke his clothes agayne and into the palays. Poore man sayd Clerimonde where haue you bene. I beleue that you are displeasaunt because that I wyll mary me. Ualentine enclyned his heade and left her, and began for to pray god. Clerimond had made a quilte to be broughte vnto him, but he lay vpon the earth, & so he did his penaunce among the dogges.

That night Orson laye with Galazye, and engendred a sōne that was called Morant the whiche helde the realme of Angorye. It was not longe after that Orson reised his hoost for to go into Angorye.

And suche honoure was done to him bycause that he was kynge crowned. And in so muche Orson shewed the noblenes that was in hym.

And in sayeng these wordes an aungell of heauen came and appeared vnto hym sayenge. ❧ Ualentyne know for a certaynte that thou shalte departe oute of this worlde within this foure dayes, for it is the wyll of our lorde Jesu chryst which sendeth me

Than the holy man Ualentyne made signe that they should bryng him paper & ynke, and whan he had it Ualentyne wrote how he him selfe in the habyte of a pylgrym discouered the treasō, & all the estate of hys lyfe. After he putte in his name and folded the halfe of the rynge in it and helde it in hys hande. And after these thinges Ualentyne made a pr

                  este to come, to whome he confessed his synnes deuoutelye and receyued the holye sacramentes, and at the houre he dyed. And forth wyth al the belles of the cyte beganne for to rynge for him, where of the people was much abashed and amerueyled. And the Emperour Orson and all the lordes and barons descended and dyd fynde the preest besyde the holy body. Frende sayd the Emperoure Orson wherfore is it that they rynge so fast in y• Cyty Syr sayd▪ the preest I thynke that it is a myracle that God wyll shew for this holy man. For euen so as he yelded vp the ghoost the belles began for to rynge on euery syde. Whan Orson saw that the poore man was deade in that place▪ he was muche pensife and ameruayled. By my fayth sayd he I thinke that this same is a holy body, and that God dothe myracles for hym. Than he aduysed the letter that he held in hys hand, and thought for to haue taken it▪ but he myght not haue it in no maner of wyse. So there came the fayre clerymonde and she assayed as the other dyd and hadde it. For also soone as she touched it the hand opened▪ and she toke the letter at her owne pleasure. Soo it was opened anone, and than Clerymonde saw and knew the halfe of the ryng,

wherefore she sayde. Lordes we shall haue tydynges a none of my loue Ualentyne. So there was a secretary that redde all the dedes of the holy man. It is not to be demaunded the grete dolours and complayntes of Orson of Bellyssante, and of Clerimonde, for he hadde his herte to harde that wepte not than. The fayre Clerimō
                  de as halfe dead keste her selfe vpon the body in makynge suche complayntes that they wende she wolde haue dyed. Alas sayde the ladye where maye I become whan I haue loste my lyfe and my comforte, and myne onely hope. Alas my loue Ualentyne what haue you thoughte whan you are come to dye so nere me in pouertye, and in so great myserye, wythout geuyng me ony knowledge of you. Alas I haue sene you often in pouertye▪ colde, and trauayle wythout geuyng you any comforte▪ Nowe am I aboue all the moost vnfortuned whan I might not know nor aduyse him that I ought to serue so longe in bytter trybulacyon▪ as true and loyall spouse. After she kyssed hys face and his handes by a meruyllous dystresse. And after the great doole the holy body was borne to be buryed in the great church of Constantynoble▪ wyth so greate a company, that none myght passe through the stretes. And it was not longe after but that the body was canonysed, and put in shrine. Soo God shewed wel that he was wel worthy for to be called saynt, for the daye that he dyed all speke men were healed of theyr maladyes that vysyted his tombe, So it was not longe after the death of Ualentyne that Clerymonde dyd make her anonne, and syth the story sayth that she was abbesse of an abbaye that was foū

And Orson abode Emperour seuen yere, the whych he gouerned well and wysely, and no more. And in that same tyme he had a chylde of Galazye named Morant, that same Morante in hys tyme posseded the realme of Angory.

So it happened hym one nyght in vysyon that hym semed that he sawe all the gates of heuen open, and sawe the Joyes of the saued, the syeges of the sayntes crowned in glorye, and the aungelles that songe melodyously before the sauyour of the world. After he sawe betwene two hyghe roches in the botom of an obscure valeye the gulfre of helle, where as was the dampned. Some in a brennynge fyre the other in boylynge caudrous, the other hanged by theyr tongues, the other assaylled and enuyronned wyth serpentes, and generally he sawe all the paynes of helle, whiche is horrible and ferefull for to recounte. After the whyche vysyon he wakened all afrayed and ameruaylled of the thynges that he had sene. And in wepyng pyteously came vnto the grene knyght and sayd to hym. Frende I knowe that the worlde is of lytell valoure, and of shorte durynge, and that all is but vayne glorye of the pompes of this worlde, displeasaunt vnto god and to the salute of the soule lytle profytable. For the whyche thynge I praye you that you wyll take kepe vpon my chyldren, and enfourme them so in dedes and condycyons that they maye gouerne the Empyre of grece to the pleasure of god and the worlde, for I leue you the charge, as vnto hym that aboue all the men of the world I trust mooste. And knowe that the remnaunte of my lyfe I wyll lede solytaryly, and habandone the worlde. And at this same houre I renoū
                  ce all worldly honoure and take my leue yf you. Whan the grene knyght heard these wrodes, he beganne for to wepe tenderly, and Orson recomforted hym and sayd. Alas wepe no more for me, but praye vnto god that he giue me strengthe and puyssaunce for to accomplysshe my wyll. After Orson departed in defendynge the grene

knyghte to tell it anye body. So he wente into a greate wodde where as he lyued holyly, & after his deathe god shewed for him many myracles and was a saynt canonyzed. And the grene knyght gouerned the chyldren so that they finisshed their dayes gloriouslye and wente vnto the blysse that neuer shall haue ende, to the which he bryng vs all that suffered deathe for vs on the crosse Amen.
