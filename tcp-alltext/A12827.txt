But rather the contrary, y• more learned, the more troubles, losses, & vexations they come vnto.

                  Mary haue you not seene how many learned men haue bene put to trouble of late within this xx. or xxx. yeares, & all for declaring their opinions in thinges that haue rysen in controuersie, haue you not knowne when one Opinion hath bene s

                     orth, and who so euer sayd against that, were put to trouble: and shortly after, when the contrary opinion was furthered and set forth, were not the other that prospered before put to trouble for saying their minds against this latter opinion: and so neither of both parties escaped but eyther first or last hee came to bee hit, of whether side soeuer he were, except it were some wetherwise fellows, that coulde chaunge their opinions as y• more & stronger part did chaunge theirs: and what were they that came to these troubles, the singularest fellowes of both parties for there came no other to the concertacion of these things but such who seeing in steede of honour, and preferment, dishonour, and hinderaunce, recompenced for a reward of

learning: wil any either put his childe to that science that may bring him no better fruite than this? or what scholer shall haue any courrage to study to come to that ende: the rarity of scholers, and solitude of the Uniuersities doe declare this to be truer then any man wt speach can declare.

                  That well may be restrained by lawes, if it were thought most profitable for y• common weale, but all men doe not agree to that poynte.

                  I wot well they doe not, and therefore it were hard to make a lawe there

                  Knight.
                  I haue heard oftentimes much reasoning in this matter and some in maintenaūce of these Inclosures would make this reason, euery man is a Member of the cōmonweale, & that, which is profitable to one mā may be profitable to another, if he would exercise the same feate. Therefore that which is profitable to mee & so to another, may be profitable to all, and so to y• whole cōmonweale: as a great Masse of Treasure consisteth of many pence, and one penny added to another and so to the thirde and fourth &c. maketh vp a great summe, so doth each man added one to another make vp the whole body of a commonweale.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  That reason is good adding some what more to it, true it is, that, y• thing which is profitable to each man by himselfe, so it be not preiudiall to any other, is profitable to y• whole commonweale, and not otherwise, or else stealing or robbing which percase is profitable to some men, were pro fitable to the commonweale, which no man wil admit, but this feate of inclosinge is so, y• where it is profitable to one man it is preiudi

                  Knight.
                  Also they will laye forth another Reason, saying, that, y• which is our owne cōmodity should bee alwayes aduaunced as much as might be, and these sheepes profit is one of the greatest commodity wee haue, therefore it ought to be aduaunced as high as it may bee.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  I could aunswere that argumēt with the like reason as I did the other: true it is, we ought to aduaunce our owne commodity as much as wee can, so it bee not to as muchEuery commo dity must bee aduaunced so as it be not preiudiciall to other greater commodities. more the hinderaunce of our other commodities.

                  Mary the first way is to make yt wooll to be of as base pryce to the breeders thereof, as the Corne is: and y• shalbe, if yee make a like restraint of it for passing ouer Sea, vnwrought as yee make of Corne: another is to increase y• rustome of Wooll that passeth ouer vnwrought.

Thus farre as touchinge the bringing downe of the price of Woolles, now to the inhaunsinge of the price of corne, to be as good to y• husbandman as wooll should be, and that might be brought to passe if yee wil let it haue as free passage ouer Sea at all times, as yee haue now for Wooll.

                  I wot well it woulde bee deere at the firste, but if I can perswade you that it were reasonable, it were so, and that the same could bee no hinderaunce to the Realme vniuersally. but greater profit to y• same, then I thinke see would be content it shoulde be so: and as touchinge the Queenes custome I will speake afterward.

                  I will assay it, albeit the matter bee somewhat intricate, and as I shewed you before, at the first vew would displease many, for they would say, woulde yee make Corne deerer then it is, haue wee not dearth ynough els without that: Nay I pray you finde the meanes to haue it better cheape if it may bee, it is deere ynough already, and such other like reasons would be sayd. But now let the husbādman aunswere such againe. Haue not you Grasters raysed the price of your Woolles, and Felles: and you Marchasit men, Clothiers, and Cappers, raysed y• price of your marchaundize and wares, ouer it was wont to bee in mannerReasons vvhy the Husbandman should be at like liber ty as other to sell his vvares. double, is it not as good reason then that we should raise the price of our Corne: what reason is it you should be at large and wee to bee restrayned. Eyther let vs all bee restrayned to gether, or els let vs bee all at lyke liberty, yee may sell your Wooll ouer Sea, your felles, your tallow, your Cheese, your Butter, and your Leather, (which ryseth all by grasing) at your pleasure, and for y• deerest penny yee can get for them. And we shal not sell out our corne, except it be at x. d. the bushell or vnder, that is as much to say, as wee that be husbandmen shall not sell our ware except it be for nothing, or for so litle as we shall not be able to liue thereon. Thinke you if the husbandman here had spoke these words, that he did not speake them some what

                  I say that all these thinges be tokens of ornamentes of peace, and that no doubt is cause of lesse housholdes: sith the buildings and trimming of those houses spendes away that, that should be otherwise spēt in houshold.

                  Knight.
                  Syr, yet I must remember you of one thing more, which men do suppose to be a great occasion of the spending of y• treasure abroade: & it is, where there is comen to y• crowne of late yeares much lands by reason of Monasteries, colleges, and Chauntres dissolued, which men suppose hath bē the cause two maner of waies, that there is lesse treasure a broade in the Realme. One is because the reuenues of the sayd places dissolued heretofore, were spent in the countrey and went from hand to hande there, for vittaile cloth and other thinges: and now are gone to one place out of the coū trey. Another is that diuers men which had any ryches or wealth vttered the same, to buy perselles of the said dissolued lands lying commodious for them, whereby one way & other the whole riches of the countrey is sweeped away.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Truth it is also, that it wringed the countrey abroade for the time, and had kept it so still if the Kinges Maiesty had not dispersed the same lands abroad among thē in the coū

                  Knight.
                  Then to retourne to the matter of the coine where wee

left. I haue heard your conceipt how the alteration thereof, within our Realme did some men no harme, as Buyers and sellers: some other it did good vnto, as Farmors that had Lande at the olde Rent: and some other as Gentlemen, men of warre, seruaunts, and all other liuing by any rated or stented rent or stipend, were great losers by it: But I heard you say it was so much withal to the losse of the Prince, that it might be to the great perill of y• whole Realme in processe of time. I meruayle howe it should be so, for I heard wise men say, that the Queenes highnesse Father did winne inestimable great summes, by the alteration of the Coyne.

                  So it was for the time, but I liken that gaynes to such as men haue when they sell away their landes, to haue the greater some at one time, and euer after to lose the continuall increase that should grow thereof: for you knowe allHovv the alt

As all Springes runneth to the Ocean Sea, & out of it are they spred abrode agayne: thē as they came into y• kings coffers at the firste in good mettall, they came forth in such as you haue heretofore seene. And albeit it seemeth at y• first vew to empouerishe but the subiects onely: at length impouerisheth also the Prince: and then if the Prince should want in time of warre, specially sufficient treasure to pay for armor, weapons, tacklings of shippes, gunnes, and other artillary necessary for y• warre, and could by no meanes haue of the subiects wherewith to buy y• same, what ease should the Realme be in? Surely in very euill, & therefore these Coynes and treasure bee not without cause called of wise men, Nerui bellorum (yt is to say) the Synowes of warre. And that is the greatest dasiger that I doe consider, should growe for want of treasure to the Prince and the Realme,

for though a Prince may haue what coyne he will currant within his Realme, yet the straungers cannot be compelled to take them. And I graunt, if men might liue within themselues, all together without borowinge of any other thing outwarde, we might deuise what coyne wee would:

They take it that all insurrections & vproares for the most parte, do rise by occasion of these clothiers: For when clothiers lack vent ouer sea: then is a great multitude of these clothiers idle. And when they be idle, thē they assemble in companies and murmur for lack of liuing, and so picke one quarrell or other to stirre the poore commonsWhether all our Wooll vvere expediēt to be

                        t that bee as idle as they, to a commotion: And sometimes by occasion of warres there musle needes bee some stay of clothes, so as they cannot haue alwayes like sale or vent: at euery which time if the said Clothiers should take occasion of commotiō, they thinke it were better that there were none of them in the Realme at all, and consequently that y• woll were vttered vnwrought ouer sea, then to haue it wrought here.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  So it may seeme to them that considers one inconuenience, and not another. Surely who soeuer hath many persons vnder his gouernaunce, shall haue much a doe to gouerne them in quietnes, and he that hath a greate familye shal haue somtimes trouble in the ruling of them. It were but a meane pollicye eyther for a Prince to deminish hys number, or for a Maister of a house to put away his Seruauntes, because he would not haue any trouble with y• gouernaunce of them: he that would so do, might be well resembled to a man that should sell his land because he wold not be troubled with the accompt of it. I thinke it meete that we did not onely encrease y• feate of clothing, but also intend diuers other mo feats & occupations,

                  Knight.
                  Mary wee might haue treasure ynough from outward Parties for our Woolles, though nonne were wroughte within the Realme: And as for an Occupation, to set our Clothiers a worke, they might bee set to the Plough and husbandry, and that should make husbandry to be the more occupied, & grasing lesse, when all these people that nowe doe occupy clothing, should fall to husbandry.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  As to the first that

                      sayd that Wooll is sufficient to bring in treasure: if it were (as it is not in deede) yet that Feate were not for the Weale, nor for continuaunce of the Realme. For when euery man would fall to breede sheepe and to increase Wooll, and so at length all other occupations should bee set a side, and breedinge of sheepe onely occupied, then yee knowe that a fewe sheepe maisters would serue for a whole Shyre: & so in processe of time y• multitude of the subiects should be worne away, and none lefte but a fewe Sheepherds, which were no number suffici

                     nt to serue the Prince at neede, or to defend this realme from Enemies. As to the other parte of your tale, whereby yee woulde that these Clothiers should fall from that occupation to husbandry: how coulde so many added to them that occupy husbandry already, get their lyuinge by the same, when they that bee husbandmen nowe, haue but a small Lyuinge thereby. And if yee woulde say to mee that they shoulde haue at all times, free vent and full Sale of

their corne ouer sea, then commeth the same inconuenience in that ye thought to auoide before, by putting them from clothing. For some yeres it should happē either for warres or by reason of plenty in all parties beyond the Sea, that they should haue no vent of their corne, and then be dryuen to be idle, and consequently for lacke of liuing to assemble together, and make like vproares as ye spake of before. They haue in Fraunce more handy craftes occupied and a greater multitude of Artificers, then wee haue here by a greate deale, and for all that they haue made many greate sturres and commocions there before this: yet they will not destroy artificers, for they know that the highest Princes of them all, without such artificers could not mainteine their estate. Doth not all theyr toules customes, taxes, tallages, and subsidies chiefely growe by such artificers? What king can mainteine his estate with his yearely reuenues onely growing of his landes: For as many seruaunts in a house well set a worke, gaines euery man somwhat to their masster: So doth euery artificer in a Realme ech gaine somewhat, and altogether a great masse to the king & his realm euery yeare it brigeth.
               
               
                  Knight.
                  And now because we are entred into communication of artificers, I will make this diuision of them. Some of thē do but conuey money out of the countrey: Some other thatThree sortes of Artificers. which they get, they do spend againe in the countrey.

That is to say, it is playne, large, and plentiful: But of these thinges that nourisheth Beastes more kindely then men. So many Forestes, Chases, Parkes, Marshes, and waste groundes being more here, then most commonly elsewhere, declare the same not to bee all in vayne, that hee affyrmes. It hath not so much erable Grounde, Tynes, Dlyues, Fruites, and such as bee both most necessary for the foode of men. And as they requyre many hands in their culture, so they finde most persons foode, as Fraunce and diuerse other Countries haue. Therefore as much grosid

And ouer that townes and Cities would be replenished wyth all kinde of Artificers, not onely clothyers, which is as it were our natural occupation, but with Cappers, Glouers, Paper makers, Glasiers, Paynters, Golde smithes, blacke smithes of al sortes, Couerlet makers, needle makers, pinners and such other, so as we should not onely haue inough of such thinges to serue our Realme and saue an infinyte treasure, that goeth now ouer for many of the same: but also might spare of such things ready wrought to be solde ouer, whereby we should fetch againe other necessary commodities or treasure. And this shoulde both replenish the Realme of People able to defende it, And also saue & win much treasure to the same. Such occupations alone do enrich diuers countreyes that be else baren of them selues.

dearth in comparison of y• former age, is y• chiefest griefe y• all men complaines most on. Secondly Inclosures, & turning of erable grounde to paslure. Thirdly decayinge of Townes, Towneshippes, and Uillages, and last diuision & diuersitie of opinions in religion. The occasions or causes of these, although I haue before diuersly declared after the diuersitie of mens mindes and opinions. Yet here I wyll take out of the same, But onely such as I thinke verely to be the very iust occasions in deede. For as I shewed you before, diuers men diuersly iudge, this or that to be the causeThe originall cause in euery thing is to be searched. or occasion of this or that griefe, and bicause there may bee diuers causes of one thinge, and yet but one principal cause that bryngeth forth the thinge to passe: Let vs seeke oute y• cause, omitting all the meane causes, which are driuen forward by the least oryginall cause, as in a presse going in at a slraight, the formost is driuen by him that is nexte hym, & the next by him that followes him, and the third by some vi olent and stronge thing that dryues him forwarde, whych is the first and pryncipall cause of the putting forwarde of the rest afore him. If he were kept backe and staied, al they that goe afore would stay withal. To make this more plain vnto you: as in a clocke there be many wheeles, yet the first wheele being sturred it dryueth the next, and that y• thyrde &c. till the last that moues the instrument that strickes the clocke: so in making of an house, there is the maister that would haue the house made, there is the Carpenter, & there is the stuffe to make the house with al: y• sluffe neuer stirres till the worke man do set it forward, the workeman neuer trauailes but as y• maister prouoketh him wt good wages, and so he is the principall cause of this house making. And this cause is of y• learned called efficient, as that, y• bringeth the pryncipal thing to effect. Perswade this man to let this building alone, and the house shall neuer come to passe, yet the house can not bee made without the stuffe, and workemen,

and therefore they be called of some causae sine quibus non, and of some other Materiales, & Formales, but all commeth to one purpose. It is the efficient cause, y• is, the pryncipall cause, without remouing of which cause y• thing that cannot be remedied. And because that it was graffed inDiuerse sort

                  And they be not here to make aunswere, if they were, I would aske them why they sell their wares dearer nowe then they were wont to doe.

                  Mary and to that I hearde many of them aunswere er this (when they were asked that question) two maner of wayes. One was they selled in deede no dearer then theyThe straungers aunsvvere touching this dearth. were wont to do: saying for proofe there of that they woulde take for theyr commodities, as much and no more of our cō
                     modities then they were wont to do. As for our tod of woll they would gieue asmuch Wine, Spice or Silke as they were wont to geue for so much. Yea for an ounce of our siluer or golde, as much stuffe as euer was geuen for y• same: and their other aunswere was yt if we reckened they did sell their wares dearer because they demaunded moe pieces of our coyne for the same then they were wont to do, that was not their fault they saide but oures, that made our pieces lesse or lesse worth then they were in tymes past. Therefore they demaunded the moe pieces of them for their Wares, saying, they caried not what names wee woulde gieue our coynes, they would consider y• quantitie & right value of it, that they were esteemed at, euery where through y• world.

                  Then I would haue answered thē there of this sort. If they came hether but for our commodities, what made it y• matter to them, what quantity or value our coyne were. If so they might haue as much of our commodities for y• same as they were wont to do. If they came againe for our siluer and golde. It was neuer lawfull, nor yet is expedient they should haue any from vs. Wherefore I would thinke that was no cause why they should sell theyr wares dearer then they were wonte to doe.

                     hat it chaunsed not all wayes together, that when they had wares whych we wanted, we had againe al those wares y• they looked for. And therefore they hauinge percase more wares necessarie for vs, then we had of such wares as they looked for, would be glad to receiue of vs such stuffe currant in most places, as might buy that they looked for elsewhere at their pleasure: And that they will say was not our coyne. And as for our lawes of not transporting ouer sea any gold or siluer, they passed not thereof, so they mighte haue the same ones conueyed thē. As they had many waies to haue it so, which I haue before remembred. Finally hee might say that wee had not in deede our coyne in that estate our selues, that by the name they pretended, but esteemed both the value & quā
                     tity of the stuffe it was made of. For if they had brought vnto vs halfe an owne of siluer, wee would not take it for an ownce: nor if they brought vs brasse mingled with Siluer, we would not take it for pure S

                     ts though they woulde otherwise perswade the one to be as good as the other. Wherefore seing vs esteeme the one in deede better then the other, as all the world doth beside, why should they not esteeme our coine after y• quantity and value of the substaunce thereof, both after the rate it was esteemed amonge vs, & also euery other where. And so as in moe pieces now there is but the value that was in fewer pieces afore, therefore they demaunded greater number of pieces, but

Now let vs see whether now goeth the cause of this matter? from the straungers: For me thinkes he hath resonably excused himselfe & put it from him.

Who doth not vnderstand of y• infinite sūmes of gold & siluer, which are gathered from y• 
                     Indies & other countries, & so yearely transported vnto these coastes? As this is otherwise most certain, so doth it euidently appeare by the cōmō report of al aūcient men liuing in these daies. It is their cōstant report, y• in times past & within y• memory of mā, he hath ben accoūpted a rich & wealty man & wel able to keepe house among his neighbors which all things discharged, was clearely worth xxx. or xl. l'. but in these our dayes y• man of y• estimation, is so far in the cōmon opiniō from a good houskeeper, or man of wealth, y• he is reputed the next neighbor to a begger. Wherefore these ii. reasons seemed vnto me to cōtain in them sufficient probability for causes of the continuaunce of this generall dearth.

most luker, they wil most gladly exercise: I shewed you before, that there is more luker by grasing of x. Acres to ye occupier alone, then is in y• tillage of xx. And y• causes therof, be many, one is y• grasing requires, small charge & smal labor, which in tillage cōsumes much of ye mēs gains, though it be true y• the tillage of x. acres brings more gaines generally amongs the maister & all his mainy then the grasing of xx. acres. Another great cause is, that whatsoeuer thing is rered vpon grasing hath free vente hoth ouer this side & also beyond the sea to be sold at the highest penny. It is cō
                     trary of all thinges reared by tillage, for it requires both great charge of seruaunts & of labor. And also if any good cheape be of corne, it paieth scant for the charge of y• tillage. And then if the market do arise either within y• Realme or without, the poore husband shalbe so restrained frō sellyng his corn, y• he neuer after shal haue any ioy to set his plough in the ground whych maketh euery man forsake tillage and fall to grasing which bringeth all these Inclosures.

And therfore if ye wil haue husbandry encreased ye must honor & cherish it, yt is to let thē haue honest gaines thereby & since yt gains shal come into your countrey why shoulde you bee offended therewt. Another way is to abate the commodity of grasing as whē any taxe is requisite to be graunted to y• Prince, if lands be chargeable thereto, to charge one aker of pasture asmuch as two of erable. Or els to burden wolles & fels, & such things as are reared by grasing y• passe to y• partes be yond y• sea vnwrouth, with double talage ouer any corn trā

And therby these inclosures to be broken vp. Also there is one thing of old time ordeined in this realme which being kept vnaltered would helpe hereunto also, that is where men are enter cōminers in y• cōmō fields, & also haue their porcions so entermedled one with another, that though they wold they could not enclose any part of y• said fields so long as it is so.

But of late diuers men finding greater profite by grasing then by Husbandry, haue founde the meanes either to buy theyr neighbors partes round aboute them. Or els to exchaunge with them so many acres in this place, for so many in another: whereby they might bringe all theyr landes together, and so inclose it, for the auoiding whereof I thinke verely, that it was so of olde time ordeined, that euery Tenaunt had his lande not all in one parcell of euery field, but enterlaced with his neighbors landes so as here should bee three acres, and then his neighbor should haue as many, & ouer that he other three or iiii. and so after the like rate be ye most partes of the copy holdes that I do know in this coū

In mine opinion. y• good occupations heretofore vsed in the sayd Townes, was occasion of theyr wealth in times past, and the laying down of those occupations againe is the cause of the decay of the same townes. Wherefore if such occupations may be

Now, the poorest youngeman in a countrey cannot be content with a lether gyrdle, or lether poyntes, Kuyues, or Daggers made nigh home. And specially no Gentleman can be contente to haue either Cappe, Cote, Doublet, Hose, or Shyrte in his countrey, but they must haue this geare come from Londō and yet many thinges hereof are not there made, but beyōd the sea: whereby the artificers of our good townes are idle and the occupations in London, and specially of the townes beyond the seaes, are well set a worke euen vpon our costs. Therfore I would wish some stay were deuised for comming of so many trifles from beyond the Sea, and specially of such thinges as might be made here amongs our self. Or els might be either all spared or els lesse vsed amonge vs, as these drynking and looking glasses, paynted clothes, perfumed gloues, daggers, kniues, pinnes, pointes, aglets buttons, and a thousande other thinges of like sort. As for silkes, wines, and spice, if there came lesse ouer, it made no matter.

And then I doubt not but all delayes set a part they will reforme them: and if they do not, I pray God send our Maiestrats temperall the minde to reforme these thinges with their seculer power. And to study for the reformation

of them, rather then for theyr possessions, Christian Princes beare not their swords in vayne: nor yet is it so straūge a thing to see Christian princes reforme the Prelates that swarue from their dueties. Thus far beit spoken touching the reformation of them yt be mynisters of y• Church.

                     oe freely consent and determine the matter. That is the onely way to descide such controuersies, and since this contencion must once haue an ende: it were better take an end be times then too late, when percase more harme shal haue ensued of this daungerous Scisine, as hath already done in other parties euen before our Eyes. And in like things hath before this time bene seene, of such sort as it is too lamentable to bee remembred: what losse of Christian men? what diminishing of the Christian faith? what continuall warres, hath the Faction of the Arrians bene the occasion of? did it not seperate and seuer at length all Asia, and Affricke from the Christian fayth? Is not the Religion, or rather the wicked supersticion of the Turke graffed ouer this Arrian Sect? did it not take his foūdation thereof? As there is no dyuision more daungerous, then that which groweth of matters in Religiō: so it were most expedient and necessary to bee quickely remedied, which cannot bee done by any other way then by a free and generall counsel, that hath bene alwayes from the time of y• Appostles who first tooke that remedy (euen to their dayes) the onely way to quiet and appease all controuersies in religion. And no doubt the holy Ghost as his promise is, wilbe priuate in euery such assembly, that is gathered together by no force or labor of any affection. But now we will say, thoughe wee would for our partes set a side partiality, and be indifferēt and vse no cohercion to get numbers & voyces that should fauour our partes, who can promise that the Byshoppe of Rome & other Prelates would doe y• same. Surely if yee did say so, yee sayd a great matter, for they be men & much more subiect to affections there yee be.

                  I am sorry that it is so late that we must needes depart nowe.

                  Doctor.
                  I will bee glad if I tarry in the towne. But as yet truly I knowe not whether I shall remayne here beyond too morrow morning, which if I do (in any thing y• my simple iudgement will reach vnto you) you shall heare my farther opinion, in the meane time I pray you so to thinke of mee as of one, that if I haue spoken any thing which may bee preiudiciall to the common weale any way, I am ready to reuoke it, and to yeelde to the iudgement of any other man, that can shew how all these griefes or the more part of thē
                     
may bee remedied by any other better meanes, for I know of many a thowsande in this lande, I may worst speake in such a wayghty matter. And so heere for this presente I take my leaue of you all.
               
               
                  Knight.
                  And thus wee departed for that time: but on the morrowe when I knewe maister Doctor was gone out of the towne, I thought not meete this cōmunication should bee lost, but remembred at y• least in mine owne priuate booke, to the intent as oportunity shoulde serue, I might brynge forth some of his Reasons in places where they might eyther take place, or be aunswered otherwise then I could. And therefore I haue noted the sayd communication briefly of this sorte as you see.
