                  To maſter Smyth and Wyllyam G.
                  Prayenge them both, for the loue of our Lorde,
                  To growe at laſt to an honeſt accorde.
               
            
            
               
                  THe fyneſt wyt that is alyue
               Cannot deuyſe by tunge nor pen
               The ſpytefull malyce to deſcryue
               That reygneth now i dyuerſe mē
               
               We maye perceyue by them that ſtryue
               For caſtynge out a carde of ten
               That charyte is ſet at nought
               So reygneth malyce in mannes thought.
            
            
               Whych thynge doth force me thus to wryte
               Concernynge the vncharyte
               Of two that nowe with hatefull ſpyte
               Do blame eche other openly
               To none of bothe I owe deſpyte
               Ner this is none Apology
               For nether parte: but ſtryfe to ſtent
               Is grounde of all myne argument.
            
            
               The ſtryfe I ſpeake of, is betwyxt
               One maſter Smyth & Wyllyam G.
               Theyr wrytynges are confuſely myxt
               With bytynge wordes, and vylany
               In eche of them, a wyll is fyxt
               To maynteyne ſtyll his vanyte
               Which hath a very feble grounde
               Wherwith his enemy to confounde.
            
            
               All this began, fyrſt by a knaue
               I wote not who, that wrote a trolle
               Wherin he dyd but rage and raue
               He knewe full lytle of ſaynt Poule
               Which wrytte the loue that men ſhuld haue
               And for one dyd thys trolle controlle
               Lo maſter Smyth a boke hath pende
               This tryflynge troller to defende.
            
            
               Some ſaye, it was for flatterye
               And ſome do ſaye, it was for mede
               For to aduaunce him ſelfe therby
               Such men (they ſaye) do ſooneſt ſpede
               That leaſt can ſkyll of modeſty
               But what he meant, therby in dede
               If I ſhall iudge, as I do take it
               Naught but malyce, made him make it.
            
            
               For thorow out his raylyng booke
               Of charyte no worde is ſpoken
               Tyll all his malyce purpoſe tooke
               For malyce, forthwith wylbe wroken
               And whoſo lyſt therin to looke
               Maye iudge him well, by his owne token
               A raylynge knaue, for to defende
               Is, in no wyſe man to commende.
            
            
               If maſter Smyth had marked well
               The purpoſe of that foolyſhe dawe
               Which trolde vpon the Lorde Crumwell
               Wyth ragged ryme, not worth a ſtrawe
               He myght haue founde that wretch rebell
               Both ageynſt God, and all good lawe
               And not haue blamed Wyllyam G.
               For blamynge his vncharyte.
            
            
               But when W. G. dyd fele the prycke
               So threattyng and malycious
               I wonder not though he dyd kycke
               For why, it was too ſclaunderous
               And for the kycke, was ſomwhat quycke
               Lo, he agayne as enuyous
               A teſty aunſwere ſtrayte dyd wryte
               With checke for checke, & ſpyte for ſpyte.
            
            
               But of this ſtryfe, the chefe effect
               That maynteyned is ſo knappyſhly
               Is ryſen by the great ſuſpect
               Of popyſhnes and hereſye
               One ſayth the other is infecte
               With ſuch a ſpyce of knauery
               I wyll not iudge, which it ſhulde be
               But bothe theyr wrytynges are to ſe.
            
            
               Theſe ſortes are both to dyſcommende
               In any man, where they be founde
               For papiſtes do nought els pretende
               But Chriſtes glorye to confounde
               And Heretykes, God them amende
               Haue but a very feble grounde
               If that they preache, that is forbod
               Or dyffer from the worde of God.
            
            
               For hereſye is nothynge elles
               But ſwaruyng from the true belefe
               As holy wrytte expreſly telles
               And he is worſe then any thefe
               That thereagaynſt in ought rebelles
               Or he that ſeketh his relefe
               Of falſe goddes, and not of Chriſt
               Is no les▪ then an Antechriſt.
            
            
               But he that hathe a popyſhe harte
               And wyll not vnto Chriſt be wonne
               He ſeekyth not, but to ſubuert
               All that the kynge hathe well begonne
               No reaſon maye hys wyll conuert
               But he wyll do, as he hathe done
               Wyth tothe and nayle, for to vpholde
               Hys blynde belefe, and errors olde.
            
            
               I wryte not thys, meanyng therbye
               That maſter Smyth is of that ſorte
               Ner I iudge not that willyam G.
               Is ſoche as Smyth dothe hym reporte
               But wryte my mynde wyth charyte
               The partyes bothe for to exhorte
               That he that fyndes hym in the cryme
               May fyrſt recante, hys raylynge ryme.
            
            
               But thys is for to dyſcommende
               In maſter Smyth aboue althynge
               That he ſo raſhlye wolde defende
               A braynles buz, in hys wrytynge
               And afterwarde ſtyll forth contende
               Wyth malyce, and wyth threatenyng
               Agaynſt that poore man wylliam G.
               Farre from all godlye charyte.
            
            
               Wreſtyng the ſcriptures as hym lyſt
               For his owne purpoſe out of frame
               But he that ſtryfe doth ſo reſyſt
               That perfect worde, he doth defame
               Wherin our helth doth whole conſyſt
               For that is it, the very ſame
               That teacheth vs the loue and drede
               To God and to the Kynge our hede.
            
            
               Perchaunce yt Smyth wyll take it yll
               That I iudge him ſo openly
               No force for that, it ſhall not ſkyll
               For he is knowen ſuffyciently
               But I proteſt, that in my wyll
               I meane nothynge malycyouſly
               But yet men muſt, for all his heate
               Repute him hotte, that ſee him ſweate.
            
            
               Lykewyſe the other dyd offende
               Wyth wrytyng ſo impacientlye
               For that is no waye to amende
               An harte that cankers inwardly
               But he his cauſe, ſhulde ſtyll defende
               Wyth mekenes and wyth charyte
               And not wyth malyce nor deſpyght
               But ſuffer mekely wronge and ryght
            
            
               Euyn as the Goſpell dothe vs teache
               Whych is oure chefe profeſſion
               For Paule hym ſelfe dyd alwaye preache
               That, for the chefe confeſſion
               Of chriſten heartes, to make thē ſtretche
               Theyr fayth vnto Chriſts paſſyon
               The only entry into healthe
               All other entryes are but ſtealth.
            
            
               Lo, thus I fynde them both to blame
               Wyſhynge to eche with all myne heart
               An honeſt mendement, wythout ſhame
               And praye to Chriſt that he conuert
               Oure iudgementes all into ſuch frame
               That they and we, in euery parte
               Wythouten grudge, debate or grefe
               Maye fyrmly ſtande in one belefe.
            
            
               Whych teacheth vs to loue and dread
               Hym that hathe power vnder God
               I mean the kynge that is our head
               That here in earth doth beare the rod
               Of true iuſtyce in Chryſtes ſteade▪
               
               By precyſe wordes we be forbod
               Hym to wythſtande, or to wythſaye
               In euery cauſe we muſt obaye.
            
            
               For whome, as for our only guyde
               Oure greateſt helpe and chefeſt ſtaye
               That daylye doth for vs prouyde
               To ſaue vs ſounde wythout decaye
               In warre and peace on euery ſyde
               Wyth one accorde let vs all praye
               To ſende hys grace, vs here amonge
               Honour, encreaſe, good lyfe and longe.
