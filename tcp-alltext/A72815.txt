               Many others are compelled, ſome to take from them a ſtampe to ſeale their owne Fuſtyans withall, and become their tennants at a yearely Rent, for they neuer care for the ſealing of the Fuſtyans ſo they may get money.
               For all which cauſes the Peticioners humblie pray, the Patent may be brought and ſeene in this honorable Houſe, and the Petitioners releeued, as to this honorable Houſe ſhall ſeeme good.
