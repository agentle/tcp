            Here foloweth the translatours prologue.
            FOr as moche as it is delectable to all humayne nature to rede and to here these auncient noble Hystoryes of the chyualrous Feates and marcyall Prowesses of the vyctoryous Knyghtes of tymes paste whose tryumphaunt dedes yf wrytynge were not sholde be had cleue oute of remembraunce. And also bycause that ydelnesse is reputed to be the moder of al vices, wherfore somwhat in eschewynge therof and in the waye of lowli erudycyon and learnynge I Iohn Bourghchere knyght lorde Berners haue enterprysed to translate out of frensshe in to our maternal tongue a noble hystory makynge mencyon of the famous dedes of the ryght valyaunt knyght Arthur sonne and heyre to the noble duke of Brytayne and of the fayre lady Florence doughter and heyre to the myghty Emendus kynge of the noble realme of Soroloys, and of the grete trouble that they endured or they attayned to the perfourmaunce of theyr vertuous amorous desyers, for fyrste they ouercame many harde & straūge aduentures the whiche as to our humayne reason sholde seme to be incredible, wherfore after that I had begon this sayd processe I haue determined to haue left and gyuen vp my laboure for I thoughte it sholde haue be reputed but a folye in me to translate beseming suche a fayned mater wherin semeth to be so many vnpossybylytees, how be it than I called agayne to my remembraūce that I had redde and seen many a sondrye volume of dyuerse noble hystoryes wherin were contayned the redoubted dedes of the auncyent inuynsyble conquerours & of other ryght famous knightes who acheued many a straunge and wonderfull aduenture the whyche by playne letter as to our vnderstandynge sholde seme in a maner to be supernaturall, wherfore I thought that this present treatyse myght as well be reputed for trouth as some of those. And also I doubted not but that the first auctour of this boke deuysed it not with out some maner of trouthe or vertuous entent, the whiche consyderacyons and other gaue me agayne audacyte to contynue forth my fryste purpose tyll I had fynysshed this sayd boke, not presumynge that I haue reduced it in to fresshe ornate polysshed englysshe, for I knowe my selfe insuffycyent in the facondyous arte of rethoryke, nor also I am but a lerner of the language of frensshe how be it I truste my symple reason hath ledde me to the vnderstandinge of the true sentence of the mater, accordinge to the whiche I haue folowed as nere as I coude desyrynge all the reders and herers therof to take this my rude trāslacion in gre and yf ony faute be to laye it to myn vnconnynge and derke Ingnoraūce and to mynysshe, adde, or augmet as they shall fynde cause requysyte, and in theyr so doynge I shall praye to god that after this vayne and transytory lyfe he may brynge them vnto the perdurable Ioye of heuen. Amen.
            Thus endeth the translatours prologue.

So Arthur toke a sparhawke on his honde, and Gouernar a gerfawcon. And Arthur aparayled hym selfe all in grene silke, and his hatte auayled with a fresshe chaplet of floures on his heade. And they rode so longe that by the sonne rysynge they came to the stang and foūd the lady and Iehannet ready aparayled ryght nobly. For Pyers the forester had purueyed them of all thinges necessarye to suche ladyes. And as than Iehannet had dronken good wynes and taken her

sustenaunce of good metes, and had forgotē all her sorowe. Wherby her beaute was newly renewed. And whan Arthur sawe her, she pleased hym moche better thā she dyd whan he sawe her fyrst. And so toke her by the fayre hande and sette them downe togyder a parte. And in the meane seasō the lady her moder and Gouernar were talkynge togyder. And the mornynge was very fayre & clere.

How be it syr I wolde ye knew that king Arthur was a noble knyght and of grete vertu And syr I wolde my louer were so good yf he be not better all redy. But one thīg syr I assure you he resembleth more to you than to ony other vnder the sonne lyuynge, bothe goynge, and in comynge of bodye and all other thynges that one persone may be lykened to an other. My owne swete and fayre damoysell sayd Arthur I wolde fayne se hym. And by the fayth that ye ow to me if it be to you no vylony I praye you shewe hym to me & I promyse you faythfully I shall loue & cherysshe. hym ryght derely.

And soo thus they comoned togyder of manye thinges tyll it was tyme that Arthur sholde retorne to the courte, for as than it was aboute pryme. Than Arthur toke his leue of the lady and of Iehannet. And so he and gouernar mounted on theyr horses and rode forth alwayes deuisyng of the maner of this damoysell Iehannet. And at the last Arthur sayd. Mayster howe saye you by the swetnesse of our damoysell and of the frenes of her herte, and how sagely & gracyo

And fro hensforth he loued & desyred so muche Florence that he thought on nothing but alonely on her. And thus departed Florence wt the archebishop her vncle, & trauailed so longe til at the last she ariued at Cornite on a friday about the houre of euensong time, & there was receyued honourably, and there remayned a great season.

               oo that the kinge Emendus demaunded of hym what he eyled to be so sad, and the Emperour answered and said syr I shal tel you the trouth. For I can not sende to you a more certayne messenger than I am my selfe for ye must beleue myne saying rather thā any other meane messenger. Syr it is of trouthe how that ye be a great prynce and of right greate power, and also syr it is wel knowen how that my strength is not smal, for I thīk as now we two at in maner the greatest men that reygneth in anye place of the worlde. Therfore it is a great welth to vs to continue together as faythful frē
               des. And truly fro hensforthe I wyll be your frende and your louer. Certaynlye syr it is so I am a man to marye, and I thynke I cannot set mi loue in no place so well and nobly as on Florence your doughter, therefore syr here with mine owne mouth I desyre you to haue her in mariage. A syr quod the king it may not be, for she maye haue none other mariage but suche as she is desteined vnto, for yf that anye other presume to take her he is but vtterlye loste and dead. And also I haue sworne and set to my seale to vpholde her destinie, and neuer to breake it. Syr sayde the Emperour beleue you them of suche fantasies as is the fayry, surely syr they haue no power nor might, but I requyre you gyue me your doughter, and soo wee shalbe togither as frēdes: truly syr said ye king I wil be glad therof: but I promysed to my quene to kepe faythfullye the

promys that I had. In the name of god sayd the Emperour, syr your queene is dead & past, who shall neuer retorne agayne, she shal neuer demaunde nor sew you for the brekyng of anye couenaunte made to her, & theyr is none other yt wil be so hardy to reproue your dede. For yf they do they shal lese theyr heades, wherfore syr I requyre you fulfyll my desyre And than ye shall binde me to be youre faythfull frende, wel syr quod the kinge yf my doughter be content therewyth it shall please me right wel, wherfore let vs

And on the nexte day be tymes they lept on theyr horses & rode forth to Cornite, and rode so longe that on a wednesday they arriued at the citie of Cornite, & so went to the palais. Than the archebysshop came to se the kinge, and brought with hym Florence. And than they all together wente vp in the palays & entred into a fayre chambre. Than the Emperour and the kyng set them downe together, and betwene them the fayre florence. And at the laste the king Emendus sayd. Fayre doughter your moder is departed thys lyfe, & it is now tyme that fro hensforth that I prouyde for your noble estate, ye be a great lady and a puyssaunt. Therfore I wyl mary you to this noble Emperour here prensent. And whan Florence hard her father speke to her of mariage all her blode begā to quake and trimbil, for she hated the Emperour euer sith the begynning of her youth, how be it she answered ryght wysely and sayd dere lord and father ye know wel that it is not yet .iii. monethes sith the death of my lady my moder. And yf I should mary me so newlie I shold be greatly blamed. Therfore syr I requyre you let this yere passe, thā syr I wil take coūsayle & tell you what I wil do. And whā the Emperour hard her speke so reasonably he coude not endure to charge her any ferther as than. and acorded to abide the terme of her desyre. And behelde wel how that she chaū
               ged colours and sore trembled, & so dyd the kinges her father also. How be it he made no semblaunt. And so they were together a longe season, till at the laste she toke licence of them and departed into her owne chambre sore amased and so abode tyll the archebysshop and mayster steuen were comen fro the courte. And as sone as they were entred into the chābre of Florēce, they saw well where as she was sitting sore sighing and wepinge. Than the bisshop toke her by the hand & demaunded of her why she made that lamentacion. As helpe me god vncle sayde Florence, my lorde my fader kepeth not well the couenauntes that he made to my lady my moder, for now he is in the mynde to marye me vnto thys Emperour. And there is no thinge that I hate so muche as I do hym. Certaynlye I had rather to suffre death than to haue him. And I haue no lenger respyte thā the ende of this yere, why madame quod mayster Steuen haue ye purchased so longe a respyte. In fayth I faythfully ensuyre you that I wyll gyue you two yere lenger, for I waraunt you that two yere after your daye ye shall not be maried to him. Maystre sayd Florence I thanke you of your good cōforte, wel quod the bysshop the Emperour dothe foly to demaūde you agaynst your wyl. For perauenture there may fortune lytle good come to hym therby. Than the bysshop toke her by the hande and ledde

And to be acqueynted wyth some of the good knightes that wyl be there, truly sayde syr Delalaund it is of trouth that there shall be a great assemble of noble knightes, for there shall be a great tornay. I pray you syr sayd Arthur, for whome & for what cause was it fyrst taken, syr yf I should shew quod syr Delalaunde, ye should than know some thing sounding to my velany, neuerthelesse it semeth yt ye be a noble man and the chyef of your company. Therfore I shal shew you as I know.
         
         
            ¶How that syr Delalaunde shewed to Arthur the occasion why yt this tornay was fyrst taken by the lorde Beauiew. Cap. xxvii.
            SYr it is of trouth my lorde yt erle of Beauiew hath alwayes loued me syth the beginning of my youth and so it fortuned whan I was yonge and lusty. I thought to go playe me oute of myne owne countrey acompanied alonely wt my squyre, hoping to vaynquysshe all the valure of the worlde. And so at the last I came into the land of myrpois and fell therein acqueyntaunce wt two noble lordes of great lygnage, who dyd me great honour. And one of them had a right fayre lady to his wyfe named the fayre lady of Rossylo
                  •
               , for whome this tornay was fyrst takē. And she had such fauoure in me and loue that within a lytle whyle I was made chyefe ruler and senesshall of all her countrey, and was of her strayte counsayle. And nothinge done without it had be done by me. For she trusted more in me than in any other person of the worlde. And in like case I was wyth the good lorde her husbande And so I continued in thys loue and fauour well the space of syxe yeres and more and it fortuned one yere yt for my sake they kept a christmas wyth open courte: wherto came many knightes of the countrey. And whan the fyrst daye of this began this lady of Rossilon wife to my sayd lorde, she was as than fresh lye appa

               ayled as it apertayned to the feast and to her estate. At whiche time to me she semed so fayre so gentil, and so proper that I thought I had neuer seen her half so fayre before. And as than her beaute stroke so inwardely to my hearte that I lost therby both meate and drinke yt euery day I began to waxe so lent of body that euery mā had meruayle what I eyled. And demaūded often tymes of me what was the cause that I so enpayred, but euer I did as priuely as I could but at the ende it auayled me nothinge. For at the laste loue constrayned me to shew vnto my loue & lady all the dolour and payne of myne inwarde herte. And on a day as it happened I tose very erly For the thoughtes of the nyght kylled me. And ryght as than I founde thys lady leanynge in a windowe. And so

Than syr Guide la launde came to him and sayde.

For it was but the fortune of that play. Truly syr sayd she, ye say nothing but trouthe, nor I bere not to you therefore any euil wyll.

Than came to theym syr Guy de la launde holdynge the ladye of Rossylon by the hande, & said to Arthur Syr I haue before thys tyme promysed you that I should shew you my ladye of Rossylon, syr beholde her for here shee is nowe present before you. And whan Arthur sawe her, he made great ioye of her and promysed her faithfully to be alway her owne knyght. And she agayne right highely thanked hym, & all other ladyes & damoyselles affectuously beheld hym, and required him that he would take the payne to vnarme him amonge theim, for thei sayd that thei woulde fayne se hym vnarmed, and somewhat for curtesye, he with said their desyre.

Than a ladye brought to him warme water in a basin of syluer to wasshe his necke and visage because of the sweting in his harneys.

And the lady of Rossylon put a mantell of scarlet aboute hym the whiche was pertaining to the coūtesse of Neuers to thentent he shuld take no colde after his labour, and so he remayned a good space amonge

But arthur excused hym as well as he myght. And all this season he had on the fresshe mantell of scarlet, wherein he semed bygge and longe and meruaylously streyght and fayre, & generally all ye knygtes behelde hym & sayde how that he was hyely rewarde of god for he was fayre & hardy, & of his chiualry surmoūted all other, for thei all sayde that the valure of al other knightes wer as nothing to the regard of his noblesse.

wherfore the Marshall dyde folye to enterpryse ony thynge agaynst hym, but pryde dooth oftentymes many harmes to his mayster, the Marshall at the fyrst course strake Arthur and brake his spere to his fyste, but Arthur for all that moued no more than though there had ben but a rede broken vpon hym.

Madame youre broder is not so fell and so outragious as I had wende that he had bene, for he taketh no more of the erth but his owne length, I thynke he slepeth, beholde howe pryuely he lyeth styll. And han the Marshall awoke out of hys traunce he was sore ashamed in that he was so ouerthrowen and demaunded yf he had ouerthrowen Arthur, than it was shewed hym naye, wherwith he was ryght sore displeased Yet than agayne he prayed Arthur on his knyghthode that he wolde Iust with hym an other course. But all that euer herde hym thought he played the proude fole and counseyled hym the countrary, but all that auayled not, for he sayde he wolde nedes yet Iuste ones agayne.

Ye say ryght well sayd the knyght Get me my harneys, and so armed hym. And Arthur than mounted on hys hors and he espyed wel where there stode before the dukes tent a gret spere the whiche he toke in his hande, and withdrew hym from the tente to abyde the knight And so when the knyght was armed he lepte on his hors, & sawe where Arthur was abyding for hym.

Than all the knightes went to hym & wolde haue vnarmed hym and led hym to the Iustice. And whan Arthur sawe that, he coude not suffre that he shoulde haue so muche shame and sayd. Syrs it is no right nor reason that ye shold lede him forth to the Iustice, for hys horse fell vnder hym, and therfore though he fel it was the faute of the horse and not of ye knight▪ for he hath done right well his deuoyre, and also he is my man, for I am his lorde, wherfore he is bounde not to withstande hys mayster, so than he is not to blame syth he hath done wel his deuour. And whan Gouernar herde his lorde speke he knew him right well by his speche, than he dyd of his helme and ranne to hym, than Arthur lyghted of his horse and so they clipped and kissed and made greate Ioye eche to other and whan Iaket saw his olde mayster arthur he kneeled downe and dyd hym great reuerence. and whan al the other knightes saw ye great honour that Gouernar and Iacket made to arthur, and how that he was theyr lord and maister they thought thā wel that he was some noble man and of some great lygnage, and therfore they wolde not displease him, but let Gouernar alone in peas, &

And Arthur herde theym well, but he fared as though he had not herde. Soo fynally these knyghtes sayd to hym.

Go on than before sayd Arthur and so Arthur rode forth after hym all the longe daye tyll it was nere nyght and than at the last they came to a myghtie strong toure the whiche pertained to a knyght named sir Roger the scot. Than the vilayne sayd to Arthur, syr knyght it is now good tyme to lodge vs here now in this castel al thys night let vs goo entre into this place but one thynge I ensure you the knyghte that oweth this place is the moost shamefullest traytoure that now is lyuynge for there is none that entreth into this place, but shamefully he dothe murdre them whyle they be in their beddes, he is also cosyn germayne to the duke of bygor, & nouewe to syr Fyrmount, who was but nowe of late slayne at the castell of ye roch by a knyght straunger, therefore nowe let se what ye wyll do, whether ye wyll go lodge in this place or not. well sayde Arthur I se well and I lye wythoute I shall be shrewdly lodged, and sythe thys knyght is of that lignage that ye speke of he is my mortall enemy, howe be it as yet I can not complayne on hym, for he dyd me neuer no trespasse, therefore certaynly I wyl go thyther to take my lodgynge. And whan the vylayne herd him say so he thought wel how that he was of great corage, and loued him therefore muche in his herte, howe be it he sayde vnto hym, syr in goddes name soo be it, let vs go thyther, and if anye yll come to you thereby I am not to blame▪ I maye not too wythall, for I haue gyuen you warnynge thereof. Than they entred in to the courte of that place.

For he dyd meruaylous dedes of armes at the castell of the roche. Syr sayde his squyer I knowe certaynlye that we can not endure against hym: but I shall tell you what we shall doo, we shall make his bed this night aboue in youre toure and sette it ouer the trappe doore of the dongeon, and we wyll take away all the bordes in the bottome of the bedde, and in the stede of the bordes sette small staues

to sustayne vp the clothes and soo whan he shall lye downe in the bedde he and the clothes and all shall tomble downe into the dongeon and than we shall soone cast downe his squyer after him and than slee this foule vylayn & whan they be in the pytte we wyll take speres and so slee them or elles let vs here thre or foure cawdrons with hote scaldynge-water and cast it downe vpon theyr hedes and so shall we slee them. and whā this syr Roger herde his squyer saye soo he was ryght well content with hym & cleped and kyssed hym and sayd this mater is ryght well deuysed for as ye haue sayd so shall it be done therwith the vylayne yssued out of the chaumbre from Arthur with his grete leuer on hes necke and as soone as he sawe syr Roger counseliynge with his squyer and other standynge togyd

Than Arthur issued out of his chaumbre. And whan syr Roger sawe hym he toke hym by the hand and sayde. Syr it is time that we wasshe our handes for your souper is all ready. Syr as it pleaseth you sayde Arthur than they wasshed and sate them downe at the table and were righte well serued, and the vylayne was set downe at an other table behynde Arthur, and so they gaue hym parte of al their meates and drynkes that they hadde and he dyde ete and drynke excedyngly moche for they could not satysfye hys apetyde. And after souper Bawdewyn Arthurs squyer toke hede to his horses. And than Arthurs bedde was made in the same place where as it was deuysed before, and the vyllayne layde hym downe on foure quysshens by the fyre in the hall as he that hadde wel eaten and dronken, and so fel fast on slepe & snorted ryght sore, wherfore syr Roger that was knighte of the place would haue wakened him, but Arthur would not suffre him, but caused hym to be couered with a grene couerlet and so let hym lye, and whā it was time for hym to go to his bedde, than the torches were lyghted vp, and the knyght cō
               uayed Arthur to his chaumbre, and at hys taking leue of Arthur he offered wt hys mouthe hym selfe and all his householde to be redy at his cōmaundemente, but in his herte inwardly he thought to be redy to cause hym to lose his lyfe. And whan he was departed Arthur wente to his bedde, and as he layd hym downe he and the bed and all fell into the great pytte, and the knyght and hys seruauntes were readye watchyng at the doore, and whan they heard the russhe, they entred into the chaumbre, and toke Bawdewyn and dyd caste hym downe too hys mayster, and Arthur receyued hym in hys armes because he should not be hurt in the fallynge downe. Than there

And at the laste by the reason of the great noyse the vylayne arose oute of hys slepe. And so whan that he hearde that great brute he wyst well that Arthur was betrayed. Than he mounted vp into the chaumbre with his greate leuer in his handes, and there he saw wel that they were aboute

to enforce them selfe to slea Arthur. Than he toke his leuer and strake so the knyght syr Roger in ye necke that he caused his tonge to hange out of his mouth nye half a fote, and therwith he fel down into the pyt to Arthur, And the vylayne than sayd to Arthur, syr knyght gnawe well on that morsell, ye shall haue more anone.

Than he entred into the kechyn & there he found the coke boylyng of a gret caudron full of water, the which should haue ben cast down on Arthur, thā he toke the coke in his armes, and did caste hym into the cawdron all boylynge, and dyd hold him downe with his leuer, & sayd. Thou shalt sethe without salte tyl thou be ynough, and if thy flesshe be harde so den I shall broyle the on the coles, than he ran to a ladder and bare it to Arthur in the pyt. Thā Arthur and Bawdwin issued out, and as soone as Arthur was without he ran to his swerde & demaundyd if there were any more to do in that place. As god helpe me syr sayd the vylayne I trowe not. Than they light vp torches and descended downe, and found an olde house ful of deade mennes bones such as the traytours of that place had slayne. In the name of god sayd Arthur to the vylayne ye haue holpen me now

Frende sayd Arthur and I promise you that to the vttermost of my power I shal do any thing that ye desire me yf a knight may do it wythout reproche of vylany. well sayd the vylayne I beleue that all this promise shall not nede. for though ye were in a maner made of yrō yet I thinke ye shuld not scape fro death but as for this nighte I shall kepe you fro any daunger. And so he made Arthur a fayre bedde, and lay all nyghte in the flore by hym, & so

Than the vilayne sayd to Arthur, syr knight can ye tel fro whens al thys darknes cometh, if ye can for do it & make it clere, than shal ye get thereby a perpetual honour, & know you for certayn that as yet there was neuer none that euer entred any ferder that euer retourned agayne therefore if youre hert fayle you enter no ferder for if ye do, ye shall dye as other haue done here before Frende sayd Arthur, howe is it that all this darkenes is here in thys place. I wyl tell you no more sayd the vylayne, but I rede you be sage & wise, for it standeth you wel in hand. And therwith Arthur departed fro them and entred into the derkenes, and the vylayn & Bawdewyn abode styll at the beginninge of the derkenes, & so they lost the syght of Arthur, but they myght se the shynynge of his sheld as farre of as one myght shote an arowe.

Thus Arthur entred into the citie & the vylain went euer before him wt his leuer on his neck bare legged, and his hat hanging at his back & euer he went forth a great pace loking downeward to the earth, and toke hede of no body that he met, but alwaies cryed out aloude he is come that shal gyue lyght, & the burgeses behelde hym well and sayd howe that he was a fole, women and chyldren ran to the wyndowes to beholde hym. And whan one bodye spake to hym, he woulde aunswere no thyng but alwayes sayd, he is come that shall gyue lyghte.

And whā Florence sawe Arthur her herte began to tremble and sodēly blusshed, but there was none that toke hede thereto, for euery man toke regard to Arthur.

And than syr Myles sayd, loo syrs whan one speketh of the wolfe lightly he seeth his taile▪ & so therwt thei welcomed the mayster, & caused hym to syt downe by Arthur. Than the maister sayd to Arthur, syr how haue ye done in this tournay, how semeth you by the knightes of this coūtre, be they not as valiaunt as the knyghtes of fraūce. Certainly mayster sayd Arthur they be as valyaunt & rather more hardy, for there is none yt I haue seen but yt they ought ryght well to be receyued in to the hye ordre of chyualry.

Madame beholde here is Arthur who is come to se you. He is right welcome sayd Florence, and so she rose ayenst hym, and the quene of orqueney toke Arthur by the hande & set him downe by her and she demaunded of hym howe that he dyde syth the tournay. And he answered her how that he dyde ryght well. By the good lorde said Florence in the tournay ye suffred moche payne & trauayle, and ryght well there ye dyde, wherfore your louer yf ye haue ony ought to loue you the better & this she said al smyling and layde her hande vpon his heed. Madame as god helpe me sayd Arthur I haue not as moche loue as I wold haue. In good fayth said the quene of Orqueney yf she were right hye & noble she shold be right well enployed on you.

And they answered yes all wt one voyce. And how should I be sure of this said Florēce. Madame sayd they all we faythfully assure you by the fayth of our bodyes & lesynge of our londes and goodes. Than Florence said to Arthur, syr ye haue here many good frēdes. Madame sayd he I thanke them and god rewarde them, & I shall deserue it to them whan I may. By my faith ꝙ the maister I byleue you well, for ye haue a large & a plenteous hert, and so therwith Florēce brake their wordes of y• mater, & fell in cōmunication of other maters til it was tyme to departe. Than Arthur toke his leue of Florence & of all other▪ & mayster Steuen conuaied him forth & said to him in his ere, syr be not trobled in your minde thoughe as to morow yt ye here y• my lady Florence be somwhat diseased▪ for she wyll do it for suche causes as ye shal know ryght well here after. well ꝙ Arthur I am & euer shall be content wt her noble pleasure, & so than ye mayster toke his leue of Arthur & retourned agayne to Florence, & Arthur went streyght to the king of orqueneys tent, & than thei both went togyder to the king Emendus tēt who as than was rysynge fro slepe, & so they thre sate downe togyder & talked of many thinges tyll it was time to goo to theyr souper, where as they were rychely serued, and after souper they sported them togyder tyll it was tyme to goo to their restes.

Saint mary sayd the kyng gentyl maister hath she than suche payne, I should be ryghte sory yf she should fortune to dye as God forbid without any issue of her body, for I wyl neuer haue wyfe, nor I haue no mo chyldren but she, wherefore than the realme of Sorolois shold be wtout heire of the right stocke the which should be a great domage to al this realme, I thinke veryly she had to grete hete yesterday ye beholding of y• tournay. Syr said ye maister with goddes loue she shal amende to morow, but in good faith syr it wer time that she were well maried, wel mayster said the king I shal thinke therof ryght shortly.
