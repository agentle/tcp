               ALthough I do not thinke theſe idle lines to be a fit preſent for your iudgment and wiſedome, whome the Arts haue adorned with knowledge and ſcience, but that I ſhall rather ſeeme to inioyne you to a pennance, then giue you any manner of content: yet (ſir) hauing had former trials of your curteſies towards me, I will number this amongſt the reſt of your fauours: you ſee the beſt gratification my ability can afford, is but a few paper wordes, and betwixt kind wordes that be written, and kind wordes that bee ſpoken, the difference is ſmall. I would bee glad to arme them with ſome better merite, and to endeuour any other thing that might be more acceptable vnto you: in the meane time, I ſhall acknowledge my ſelfe more beholding vnto you, to vouchſafe me a reading, then my little skill is able to merite by writing. I will not make any further oſtentation, neither will I light a candle to the ſunne, but will reſt,

            To all thoſe Gentlemen, that are worthily ſo reputed.
            
               GENTLEMEN, that you might the rather know your ſelues to be Gentlemen, I haue endeuoured theſe lines, wherein I haue distinguiſhed of Gentlemen, both currant and counterfeit: I call them currant, that are wel known to be Gentlemen by diſcent, or haue been otherwiſe aduā

               ending to the generall good of the common wealth.
            I call them counterfeit, that do vſurpe the name & title of gentlemen, that are lately crept out of a thatcht houſe, or from the dunghil, by ſcraping together alittle pelfe, that haue neither petigree, vertue, nr honesty, whereby to make claime, and yet will intrude themſelues and take more vpon them then becommeth baſenes. I hope I ſhall neither off

Hee that cannot endure the reprehenſion of Sinne, let him neuer goe to Church, and he that cannot abide to heare folly reproued, let him neuer reade Bookes. But as miſtres Minx is many times ſicke, but ſhee cannot tell where: ſo there be ſome would fame finde fault if they could tell how: but for him that is of the reprehending humour, here is matter for him to worke vpon. My lines are like the Shoomakers leather, that if a man complains of a ſtraite ſhoo, they will ſwear one daies wearing will make it retch, againe, if they be too wide, they will ſay the leather will ſhrink in the wearing: ſo my lines according to the diſpoſition of the Reader, may be made either too ſhort or too long: for although I haue fitted them to mine own fantaſie, yet I know I cannot fit them to euerie mans humor▪ In the ſame pasture where the Bee

Xenophon was wont to ſay, that if beaſts could paint, they would pourtray God himſelf like a beast: ſo the ignorant ſort, that wil draw all thinges to their own appetites, and but to what themſelues do affect, will make thoſe expoſitions of any thing they read, as the writer himſelfe neuer thought vpon: and as they will not let to diſpraiſe thoſe things that they could neuer conceiue: ſo they wil praiſe that againe which they neuer vnderſtood.

            Roome for a Gentleman, Or the Second Part of FAVLTES.
            
            
               IT hath beene holden for a great bleſſing of God, when the ſworde and all other weapons of warre, are turned into Plough-yrons; but we doe not conſider that war is the miniſter of Gods iuſtice, either for contempt of himſelf, neglect of his Religion, or for the wicked life of worldlings; it is the ſurfers of peace, that hatcheth vppe war, and it is the finnes of the people, that draweth the Soldiers Sword, for warres are but as a Corrector to the diſorders of peace, it is as fire to the mettell that wants refining, as a phiſition to a body ouergrowne with groſſe and corrupt humors, it is the ſcourge of Security, the plague of Timeritie, a miſerable neceſſity in nature, and a neceſſary Corrector of times infirmity.
            
               Warre, ſtirs vp the bloud, it cals courage to the field, and it is the Theatre where on Nobilitie was borne to ſhew himſelfe.
            
               Peace breedes Cowards, it effeminates our mindes, it pampers our wanton wils, and it runs headlong into all ſorts of ſinne.
            
               
               VVarres, vpholds our right, Peace will put vp wrong, and what we honourably winne in war, wee cowardly looſe againe▪ in peace.
            
               Peace, filles the world with pompe, war abates the edge of pride, Peace feedes Folly fat, makes vertue lean, and it armeth Cape a Pee, all manner of inormity; warre ſpends the pelfe that Peace hath miſerably ſcraped for. And what ſhould I ſay, warre like a ſtorme that comes ratling in the skie, doth clenſe and purge the aire infected with the miſty fogs of peace: war hath had his beginning with the world, and it will neuer haue end ſo long as there is a world.
            
               Valiancy hath an eye to warre, and warre hath the like againe to peace, and warre ſhould not be vndertaken but to the end to haue peace; and as peace is the parent of proſperity, ſo it is the nurſe of pride, and draweth after it the very corruption of manners.
            In the time of peace, a fauorite ſhall ruffell it out with the wealth of a realme, whilſt Souldiours in the time of warre are ready to mutiny for want of pay.
            In warre, thoſe are onely dignified that are found to be valiant, or otherwiſe approued to be of worthy reputation, peace preferreth Carpet Knights, and ſuch as will ſcratch at dignity without deſert.
            The Souldiour, who in the time of warre ſauoreth of ſweat, (the true teſtimony of exerciſe and labour) in the time of Peace, is all to bee ſpiced with perfumes (the witnes of effeminate and womaniſh nicite.)
            As long as Carthage waged warre againſt Rome, ſo long were the Romaines in dayly exerciſe of Armes, vigilant and watchful, fearing that which after followed▪ but Carthage being once razed and brought to deſtruction,

the youth of Rome being at liberty▪ and freed from all feare and care of Warre, ſet looſe the bridle of pleaſure, and hauing no ſtranger againſt whome to exerciſe Armes, they conuerted their weapons againſt their owne bowels, arrearing ciuill warres and ſeditions amongſt themſelues, which brought the Romaines liberty to ruine: for which cauſe S. Auguſtine in his booke De Ciuitate Dei ſayeth, More hurtfull was the City of Carthage after her deſtruction, then during the whole courſe and ſeaſon of the warres, which the Romaines had with her, for whilſt they had enemies in Affricke, t hey knew not what vices ment in Rome.
            
            
               Adrianus in the time of a generall peace, would yet vndertake ſeuerall iornies, ſometimes into France, ſomtimes into Germany, otherwhiles into Aſia, but ſtill cauſing his men of warre to march with him, leſt being idle, they might likewiſe grow effeminate.
            I might heape together a great deale of matter, if I ſhould ſpeake of thoſe miſeries that do attend & waite vpon warre; but if I ſhould enter into a particular deſcription, how many vices are hatched vp in the time of peace, I might quickly ſpie out matter wherewith to beginne, but neuer find time when to make an end; we haue ſuch dayly innouations, aſwell of Follies, as of Faſſions, that our aunceſtors (I perceiue) were but bunglers at vice, they had not the wit to grace a ſinne, nor to ſet it forth to the ſhow, their conceites were but dull and blunt, they had not the frisking wittes of this our age: but I will not intangle my ſelfe in that Laborinth, to ſpeake of thoſe follies that are already paſt, I am come to a fragment of the time preſent, t
                  •
                a forward Sprigge, that is already ſprouted and ſprong from

this little prety moment of our calme and quiet peace.
            The warres that were wont to ſtirre vp mens minds to ſtriue who ſhould march in the formoſt rank againſt the Enemy, who ſhould giue the firſt charge, and who ſhould make the firſt approch to enter the breach, this litle time of peace hath conuerted to a baſe alteration: for now all our ſtrife and contention is, who ſhall ſit aboue the ſalte, who ſhall goe next the wall, who ſhall ſtand formoſt in the Herauldes bookes, and who ſhall goe before, and who ſhall come behind.
            We call it a happy peace, & we bleſſe the time withall, when our Armes are ſet apart, when our Enſignes are fyrled vp, and when our Drummes and warlike inſtruments do ſerue to fetch home May, or are hanged by the wals: but the warres of Weſtminſter Hall, are then in their greateſt fury, and the incounters there maintained and continued, not againſt an open foe to our country, not againſt a Traytor to the Prince, or againſt a rebell, or a ſpoiler of the common wealth; but the neighbour againſt the neighbour, the friend againſt the friend, the brother againſt the brother, & ſomtimes the father againſt the ſonne.
            Theſe warres are vnnaturall wars, and theſe wars wil neuer bee diſſolued, but are like to grow euery day more violent then other; and I wonder all this while we haue had no hote Alarmes about this precedence, and taking of places; for it is growne to a general controuerſie, not onely amongſt the inferior forte of thoſe that would faine be reputed to be Gentlemen, but likewiſe amongſt the better ſort of thoſe that be knowne to be Gentlemen by birth and others that by their places

and profeſſions are gentelized, and worthy to bee ſo eſteemed, as hereafter ſhall be declared.
            I will not meddle with thoſe of the decayed order of Knighthood, amongſt whom there hath likewiſe fallen out ſome contentions, the vnworthy ſomtimes comparing with thoſe that bee worthy; for I doe make a difference in reputation between Knight and Knight, and I hope hereafter to ſhew a reaſon why.
            But to come to thoſe intruders that do extort to thē
               ſelues places and dignities that belong to others, who neither by birth, nor by diſcent can challenge the place or title of a Gentleman, vnles (perhaps) countenanced by ſome petty office, or otherwiſe haue raked together ſome yearely reuenue, more then all their anceſtors were euer able to leaue to their heires▪ and not attained vnto by vertuous induſtry, but gotten ſometimes by deceiuing the Prince, otherwhiles by preiudicing the common wealth, & moſt times, by exacting & oppreſſing as many as they had to deale withal, but vnder theſe pretences, they would vſurpe to themſelus a kind of preheminence, to throng & thruſt before thoſe that are their betters both by birth and qualitie: and this malipert ſawcines maketh them to be the more hateful to as many as know from whence they are deſcended.
            It is not the giuing or taking of places, that either giueth or taketh away vertue, nor euery man that is inueſted with an office, is not therefore by and by had in the better reputation, but if they be ſo deſirous of eſtimation, they muſt indeuor by their own labor & induſtry, to heape to themſelus ſo precious treaſure, when curteſie & affability are known to bee the inſtruments, whereby the hearts of the people are won.
            
               
And as this thruſting and ſtriuing for places, is a common ſicknes amongſt men, ſo the infection is farre more violent amongſt women, and hath preuailed ſo farre, as (I thinke) it be paſt cure, for not one amongſt them, being willing to giue place, but euery one endeuouring and ſtriuing to take place, they are ready to ſcratch for it, and to take their roomes perforce, & will not let to render reaſons to maintaine their right; one makes her plea, my huſband is a Squire, and I will giue place to none but to my Lady; an other will ſay, my husband is a Doctor, and why ſhould not I go with the formoſt: one ſtands vpon her owne petigree, and deriues her ſelfe from ſome ancient ſtocke or family, another vauntes of her husbands office, another of his wealth, another of her chains, iewels & ſilken gowns, and of ſo many other vanities beſides, that if their huſbands ſhould fal to dealing in thoſe quarrels ſet abroch by their wiues, they would neuer be determined without bloody noſes.
            But what women be thoſe that doe moſt generallie ſtand vpon thoſe termes, or that will ſooneſt preſſe to be thus forward, but thoſe that be of the baſeſt birth, or haue beene otherwiſe noted and detected of infamy?
            I doe not meddle with Ladies all this while, for although theſe vpſtart women be ful of iniury, yet Ladies that are deſcended of gentle parentage, are full of curteſie, they are not vengible the one againſt the other, they are not proud, they are not ſlanderous, they are no tatlers, to carpe at thoſe thinges that belongs not vnto them; now Ladies in theſe daies (a great many of them) are none of theſe great vaunters, to brag of their worſhipfull parents, of their fathers, of their grandfathers:

they would be much aſhamed in any proud humour, to go ſearch the Herauldes bookes for their aunceſtors Armes, or to ſeeke out from what ſtocke or lineage they are deſcended.
            But what do theſe men or women gaine, that doe ſtand ſo much of their tiptoes? that do take the matter ſo highly vpon them, and are ſo ready to perch before their betters? they doe but be▪piſſe their owne credits? they raiſe vp duſt to hurt their owne eyes, for it makes others to harken after them, what they were by birth, how they haue beene brought vp, what their conuerſation hath been in times paſt: and there will be inquiſition made, not onely of themſelues, but of their parents, firſt what they were, from whence they came, & how they haue liued, for wiſe mē takes no knowledge of our riches, but of our vertues, not of our offices, but of our honeſties, not of our dignities, but of our deſerts; not of our proud and lofty lookes, but of our kinde and curteous behauiours, but howſoeuer it bee befitting vnto men, O what an ornament it is to a woman to be of a mild and modeſt diſpoſition?
            And yet I cannot commend this counterfeit ſobrietie in her that will ſit and ſimper, and ſpend a whole diner-time, in ſpeaches, ſtrained and deliuered like oracles, that will bee drawing out of a welcome, whilſt a man would haue eaten his dinner: no, I rather commend her that hath a little verball quicknes, a nimble ſpirited wench that can laugh when ſhe liſt, weepe when ſhe liſt, chide when ſhe liſt, that can be ſick when ſhe liſt, and well againe when it pleaſe her ſelfe, that when ſhe is vp and ready in a morning, her day-worke is done, that is fit for all companies, that hath a ſweete

touch with her tongue, a quicke looſe with her lippes and t'is no matter though ſhe do ſometimes lie; for if ſhee be married, a lie well told may ſometimes pleaſe her husband.
            O what a pretious ſight it were to ſee a woman that were but young in yeares to bee ſober and modeſt, glory and admiration attends her in all her actions? & it were good in her that were olde likewiſe, becauſe in an old woman, the contrary were abhominable, b ut where ſhould wee finde ſuch a woman ready made, vnleſſe we ſhould beſpeake her of purpoſe, and then we ſhould pay more for the faſhion, then the whole frame would be worth.
            If a man ſhould but ſtraine his penne a litle to write in the generall praiſe of women, and ſhould paint them forth with ſo many perfections as nature doth not vſually beſtow in theſe our dayes, as many women as did but vnderſtand of this deſcription would wonder and be inquiſitiue what women they ſhould be that were ſo magnified, and if they did not reward the writer with a mocke, his beſt recompence ſhould bee, to be thought a meere diſſembler: but hee that ſhoulde but blaze the abuſe of any one particular woman, and ſhould write in an obſcure manner, not naming what one it were that he had thus diſplayed, euery woman that did but heare it, would take it to her ſelfe, and ſhee would not be perſwaded, but that it was ſo ment.
            The pretious iewels that were wont to garniſh thoſe women, that were moſt honourably eſteemed of, were the excellent ornaments of modeſty, of ſobrietie, of baſhfulnes, of ſilence, of chaſtitie, and ſuch other, but now thoſe are beſt eſteemed, that are moſt impudent,

that are moſt audacious, that are moſt ſhameles, that are moſt vnciuill; and what ſhall I ſay, that are many wayes more maſculine then men.
            It is ſtrange again to ſee ſome women that do ſtand vpon their wiſedome, that do ſtand vpon their honor, that do ſtand vpon their honeſty; and yet will ſeem to vphold and maintain thoſe women that are immodeſt in their manners, laſciuious in their life, filthy in their communication, odious and hatefull in all their demeanours, that haue beene noted of incontinencie, and well knowne to be infamous: and yet thoſe women, that a man would thinke they were made all of vertue, (& without doubt, ſome of them no leſſe good then they ſeeme) they will notwithſtanding hold them company, take them vp into their Coaches: nay, they will imitate them, ſometimes in their gariſh and light attire, that are many times more Curtiſan-like, then eyther modeſt or comely: ſometimes againe in their impudent boldnes of behauiour, that were more fitting for my Lady Greene-ſleeues, then decent for thoſe women, that are of any good ſort or reputation. Amongſt the Romains, it was accounted a great reproch and infamy, for a woman to bee prayſed by any man, eyther for her beauty, or for her feature, or for any quality that was not coreſpondent to vertue▪ but Thucidides accounteth thoſe women to bee moſt honeſt, that were leaſt ſpoken of eyther in prayſe or diſprayſe.
            Saint Auguſtine ſpeaking of the light behauiour of women, doth rather allow of that maiden, wife or widow, that will exerciſe her accuſtomed labour, (though it be on the Saboth day) then he doth of that woman that is a dancer, that muſt ſurrend
                  •
               r herſelf to

be felt and handled by thoſe men, that are not onelie vnchaſt in their imbracements, but many times vngodly in their appetites, and filthy in their deſires.
            I might take occaſion here to ſpeake of Faſhions, it was wont to be a diſeaſe amongſt Horſe, but now it is become a generall ſicknes amongſt men and women; and yet I thinke Faſhions be good for ſomewhat, for of my conſcience it driueth a great number to Church, that goeth more to ſhew their own pride, and to learn the new Faſhions that are broughtin by others, then to mend their owne manners, or to leuell their liues as they are taught by the Preacher.
            
               Diogenes laughed them to ſcorne, that by interceſſion ſought helpe from the Gods, and yet continued in a diſſolute and in a laſciuious manner of life: and me thinkes it ſtands with reaſon, that graue ſhowes and light attires can neuer hang well together.
            When the Cretans were vnnaturally intreated by the Romaines, they did not pray vnto the Gods to plague them with peſtilence, with warre, with famine, and ſuch like, but that they would ſend amongſt them new Faſhions, new inuentions, & new fangled follies, which they knew to be a greater plague and puniſhment, then any other that might befall them: And Anacharſis was put to death for ſeeking to plant ſtrange faſhions which he had learned in his trauell.
            For thoſe women that be good & godly (as I know there bee a great many) they will neuer bee diſpleaſed though I blaze the abuſes of the ill; for thoſe other that be bad, if they be angry I care not, and for her that hath a guilty conſcience, if ſhe find her ſelfe to be toucht, let her beginne to chide firſt in Gods name.
            
               
It is written that Crates vſed to ſcold with common women, which he knew to be of miſchieuous and vengible tongue▪ which he did of purpoſe, whereby to inure himſelf to beare all reproches with the more patience: And Diogenes, to much like purpoſe, walking through Athens, and finding the ſtatues and Images of many wo thy men which had beene erected for their well deſeruing in the common wealth, went vnto them al, one after another, begging gifts and asking of almes: and being demanded what he ment to begge of dumb Images, he anſwered, I learne hereby to take deniall patiently.
            Now if there be a woman that is ſicke of the ſpleen, and a little to eaſe her ſtomacke, will needs pronounce her ſelfe guilty before ſhe bee accuſde, I am furniſhed (you ſee) with preſidents inough to teach me to bee patient, & to beare all reproaches that may be imputed againſt me, by the moſt bittereſt and ſpitefulleſt tongs.
            A woman of vertuous life is neuer offended at any report that is ay
                  •
               ed of her; for if it be true (ſhee being vertuous) it muſt be to her prayſe, if falſe, her life and manners will proue the reporter to be but a lyer, & her owne innocency is inough to protect her againſt any deprauer.
            But I am out of the text that I ment to take in hand; and here a man may ſee what it is to hit into good company, I am gotten amongſt a company of women, a
                  •
               d now I am loth to depart; but I muſt take my leaue of them for a time, and follow my vndertaken Subiect.
            I remember, I was about to ſpeake of a many of wranglers that were ſtriuing for places, and diſputing

for dignities, but fearing I might bee accuſed of ſacriledge to ſteale out of the Goſpell, I might remember here where it is written; VVhen thou art bidden to a Feaſt, ſit thee downe in the loweſt roome, that when the goodman of the houſe commeth in, he may ſay, Friend, ſit vp higher, and ſo it ſhall be for thine honour, &c.
            It is a great vertue in a man, to be an vpright Iudge of himſelfe, for as it is the firſt Chapter of Fooles, for a man to thinke himſelfe to be wiſe; ſo it is a ſigne of as little wit, to thinke better of our ſelues then there is cauſe.
            
               Bucephalus, Alexanders horſe, in an ordinary ſaddle, would eaſily admit any man to ride him, but being appointed in his royall furniture, would ſuffer none but Alexander to mount him: ſo there be ſome that in a meane eſtate (ſuch as their fathers held before them) haue beene known to be lowly & tractable enough, but being after crept into an office, or a little aduanced, whereby they might proule for pence, they know not how to behaue themſelues, but doe thinke that pride, diſdaine, & curriſh demeanour, are the only complements belonging to Gentility. And this is it that armeth them with this ſawcines (I mean) to take place of their betters whereby they become iniurious, and in time might grow to a matter of quarrell, when amongſt perſons of reputation, honour is preferred before life; & euery iniurious action not repulſed, is holden by the opinion of all magnificent minds to be diſhonourable, infamous and reprochfull.
            It ſhould not be amiſſe therfore, but rather behouefull, that we might be informed what iniury is, wherby we may with the more facility, both moderate our

ſelues, and learne to repreſſe it.
            I doe not goe about to incite men to vnaduiſed or needles quarrels, but to informe the true meane how to ſhunne offences, or being offended, how to repreſſe an iniury, with a due reſpect, both of honour and a chriſtian conſideration: Iniuries are aſwell offered by wordes as by deedes; in wordes, by vnſeemely ſpeeches, as in giuing the lie, or ſuch other like; in deedes, no leſſe by depriuing men of their reputation & right, as in deprauing them of their due by any other meane
                  •
                I might ſpeake of infinite wrongs to be offered in both theſe kindes, that might draw to blowes: but I will let them paſſe, for I hold it no leſſe expedient for wiſemen to know when it is time to put vp, as when it is time to draw their weapons.
            Vertue alloweth a iuſt Reuenge, and admitteth the defence of property and right: yet true it is, that the law of God willeth vs to be of that perfect patience, as not onely to endure iniurious wordes, but alſo quietly to diſgeſt and putvp all other wrongs that are offered, what, or howſoeuer: but very few men haue attained to that perfection in ſuffering wrongs and iniuries, as the Law of God requireth: there is nothing more intollerable to fleſh and bloud, then to endure wrong; let Diuinity and Philoſophy too, perſwade what they liſt, for impatient cruelty, making hot ſpurde youth his Agent, doth thinke no man capable of glory, that is not apt and ready to reuenge.
            And here Cicero, to aggrauate the matter, tels mee, That it is as great iniuſtice to put vppe an iniury, as to doe awrong: But if it be iniuſtice to put vppe an iniurie, why then it is a vertue to Reuenge, but

Reuenge proceedes of Anger, for Anger is the mother of Reuenge, and what affinity may be betweene angry Reuenge, and doing of Iuſtice, I thinke is as much as is betweene doing of right, and doing of wrong, and ſo by conſequence as is between vertue and vice.
            I know not how to reconcile theſe matters together, but for him that is iniured I thinke the ſureſt way is to reuenge himſelfe by patience, for hee that is armed with patience, to endure and ſuffer wrong, puniſheth more in not puniſhing, then the haſtieſt Executioner that is moſt ſpeedy in reuenge.
            Perhaps (now on the other ſide) it may ſeeme contrary to the courage of man, to relent when they haue done a wrong, but rather to perſiſt, and to vphold one wrong with another, the leſſe with the greater: if wee could then but examine the matter with a chriſtian conſideration, it would appeare that he that doth perſiſt to doe euill, doth ſtill endeuour to condemne himſelfe.
            Who will impute him to be worthy of infamy, that is cowardly ſtricken by another, or that is oppreſſed by aduantage by any manner of meane? nay, who will not rather condemne him that offereth ſuch an iniury and acquit him to whome it was done?
            And who will not laugh to ſee the ſawcines of ſome little worthy perſons, in whome there is neither vertue, deſert, nor any other merite of worth, but a little audatious boldnes, and yet will pearch and preſume to take that place that is an other mans right?
            To conclude therefore I ſay, that infamy is due to him, that willingly doth a diſhonourable wrong; but

no reproch at all to him that taketh it.
            But to the end that men might know their owne places, both what they ought to take, and how they ought to giue, it ſhall not be amiſſe to diſtinguiſh of Gentry, and to ſhew the difference between Gentlemen and Gentlemen; from whence, and how it growes.
            I ſay there is a diſequality in Gentry, for vertue being (as it were) the firſt ſteppe to Generoſity, hee that can bur vaunt of the Scutchions left vnto him by Anceſtors, ſeemeth himſelfe to bee very deſtitute, for the more high he fetcheth his petigrie, the leſſe reputation he meriteth himſelfe, if hee cannot continue that honour, left vnto him by his Anceſtors.
            Whilſt we doe hunt after a phantaſticall glory, wee doe abandon the true; for the ground of honor conſiſteth in vertue.
            
               Marcus Marcellus builded a Temple in Rome, which he called the Temple of Honour; but ſo ſeated, that none could enter it, but they muſt firſt paſſe thorough the Temple of Vertue.
            
            It might be demanded, why noble bloud ſhould be preferred before baſe Parentage (as they call it) for neither is he that is of Gentle bloud more valiant then he that is of low degree, neither in his race more ſwifter, nor in health more luſty▪ nor of greater force; if then the caſe ſtandeth thus, that neither the fauour of Fortune, nor the comely feature of the body, diſtinguiſheth man from man, and as it were, by diſtinct offices deuideth them, no doubt, the diuerſity is knowne by the qualities of the mind.
            
               Gein Ottoman brother to the great Turke, being

a priſoner at Rome, it was tolde him, how Fardinando was nimble and quicke in running, leaping, vawting, and ſuch other exerciſes of the body: Ottoman anſwered that the ſlaues and baſe borne of his Country were endued with all thoſe qualities, and that the Princes & mighty men, were onely famed & renowned for their valiance, their bounty and liberality.
            An excellent anſwere of a Heathen, and it is truth, the Gentility as it is a glorious image of ancient progeny, ſo it is commonly garniſhed and repleniſhed with ſingular vertues, farre exceeding the common ſort.
            
               Seneca aduiſeth, that who would iudge of a Gentleman, that might bee reputed worthy of that name, muſt firſt ſtrip him out of his gay clothes, hee muſt ſet aſide his liuinges and titles of honour, with all other fauours of Fortune, he muſtalſo imagine himto be with out a body, nor he muſt eſteeme nor value nothing, but the excellency of the minde. If Gentlemen in theſe dayes ſhould be brought to theſe Ballances, and none admitted worthy but thoſe that hold out weight, there would not be ſuch a thronging and thruſting as there is, the bordes end would bee more peſtered th en the firſt meſſe.
            I holde not him that from a baſe eſtate is exalted by a Princes fauoure (without deſert) to be a Gentleman▪ for a Prince at his pleaſure may make a man either rich or poore, but to make him eyther good or bad, belongeth onely to the grace of God, but not to the Prince.
            A Prince may then make a man great, but he cannot make him good, hee may giue him honourable titles, but he cannot giue him an honourable minde; and

albeit that Gentlemen of late preferment, may excell in vertue, wit and policy; yet in this minority of years, they may not compare with families of noble bloud, and long diſcent: for euen as we do chiefly reuerence gray hayres and elder yeares; ſo the ancient race of gentility, is eſpecially to bee eſteemed and honoured, and a new made Gentleman, with what quality ſo euer endued (yet being the firſt of his houſe) muſt giue place to the other, that are of more auncient lineage and more honourable diſcent, prouided alwayes, that thoſe that are digreſſed from the vertuous endeauors of their honourable aunceſtors, let them be reputed as degenerate, and vnworthy to chalenge eyther place or title: for he that doth ſwerue from the ſteppes of his aunceſtors, hee ſtaineth the name of his family.
            The Romaines and the Lidians had a Law, that thoſe ſonnes that followed not their fathers ſteppes in vertue, but liued in a licentious and vicious manner of life, ſhould bee diſinherited, and their landes and goodes beſtowed of the moſt honeſt of the race: And we ſee many families, that in times paſt were obſcure, and in ſmall account, are now inkindled and ſtirred vp, to purchaſe praiſe and winne renowne, by their owne vertuous indeauors: we ſee others againe that haue diſcended from old and ancient families, that by their owne vitious and vilde demeanoures, haue crackt their own credites, and haue extinguiſhed the glory of their predeceſſors.
            By a Gentleman born, it is ment, he muſt be diſcended from three degrees of Gentry, both by father and mother (for this is the opinion of the Heraldes) otherwiſe they are called Gentlemen of the firſt head, nightgrowne,

muſhrumpes, ſtart-vppes and ſuch other.
            
               Nobilitie it ſelfe (as ſome would deſcribe it) is a commendation proceeding from the deſerts of our ancient Progenitors: but to ſpeake truely, both according to Diuinity and Philoſophie, there is no true Nobility, but that which proceedes from vertue.
            Faith is a rich treaſure, yet without works it is dead; ſo Nobility is honorable, but without vertu it is baſe. Iacob and Eſau were brethren deſcended from one wombe, yet the one was noble by vertue, the other ignoble by vice: ſo Titus and Domitian were both ſonnes to the Romaine Emperour veſpatian, but Titus was called by the Senate, The delight of the world, and Domitian through his execrable tyranies was named, The monster of humaine kinde. Nobility without vertue, is like a Knighthood without deſert: and as there hath beene many noble Families, excelling in vertue, & quality of wit, ſo there hath beene Cities of honorable account, namely, that of Athens, worthily famed & renowned, where there were bred many wiſe ſages an d valiant Captaines, which through their counſell and wiſedome did rule and preſerue the weale publike, by whoſe puiſance the enemy was repelled, by whoſe vnconquerable courage & vertue, their dominions were inlarged.
            I might likewiſe ſpeake of mighty Rome, that was ſometimes miſtris of the world, it was then accounted a great glory to be reputed a Romaine: but as (by the opinion of her owne writers) ſhee had her originall from a baſe and a baſtardly generation, I meane, from the fugitiue Troians that eſcaped the burning towne, and ſlaughtered heapes of their betraied Countrimen:

but her glory hath beene ſithens obſcured, and (as it were) ouerſhadowed with darknes: but I wonder that our Engliſh Nation, for the glory of antiquity ſhoulde bee ſo fond to recount their Genealogy fro m ſuch a deſteyned progeny: a fugitiue people, a crauen generation, hunted and ferrited, from place to place, from country to country, from region to region: their City of Troy it ſelfe three times ſackt, yet to proue our diſcents from thence, we do mingle our matters with ſo many fained inuentions, as it might ſeeme ſtrange vnto wiſemen, but more abſurd to enterlace the vain fantaſies of Poets with matters of truth; and that it might the better appeare, I will ſet downe the ſtory in as briefe and ſhort manner as I can.
            
               Leomedon the ſonne of Dardanus, the feyned ſonne of Ioue, a falſe periured Prince, for whoſe offence (as their owne hyſtories makes mention): Troy was firſt ouerflowne by the raging of the ſea, after that viſited againe with a moſt deadly plague; which could not be appeaſed but by the monthly gift of a Virgin, to a ſeamonſter, as they fell out by lot, till in continuance of time, it lighted on Heſione the daughter of Leomedon, who was reſcued & freed by Hercules vpon conditions formerly vowed, proteſted and plighted by oath to be performed by Leomedon to Hercules: but Heſione being deliuered, the ſea-monſter ſlaine, and the City freede from all incombrances by Hercules: Leomedon now againe falſifying his promiſe, Hercules to reu enge the diſloyalty of that twice periured prince, firſt ſacked the City of Troy, where Leomedon ſauing himſelfe by flight, Hercules carried away with him priſoners, Priamus and Heſione, the children of Leomedon, who after

               Hercules being departed, returned againe, and hauing reedifyed and new builded the city, was a ſecond time aſſaulted by Hercules, who hauing ſlaine Leomedon, and now againe taken the City; Hercules that was magnificent in all his enterpriſes, enlarged Priamus, and eſtabliſhed him in Troy to ſucceede his father; who yet againe erected and builded that infortunate City which flouriſhed in pompe and pride till his ſonne Paris, (who nothing digreſſing from his vnfaithfull progenitors) in a treacherous manner ſtole away Helena the wife of Menelaus, king of Lacedemon, who had both honorably feaſted, banqueted and entertained both him and his company: in reuenge of which fact, the angry Greekes ariuing before Troy with a mighty Army, after ten years ſiege, and a great ſlaughter of Princes, with other valiant men, by the treaſon of Aeneas, together with the conſent of his father Anchiſes, & Antenor his confederate; the City of Troy was taken, miſerably burnt and defaced, the country ruined and waſted, the aged king Priamus miſerably ſlaine, and the whole Troian eſtate vtterly ouerthrowne: thus writeth Dictis Cretenſis, that ſerued with the Greekes againſt the Troians during that ten yeares warres, who maketh a large deſcription of the diſloyalty of the Troians, & (in mine opinion) not without iuſt cauſe; for although Virgil in his Aenidos doth write more fauourably in their behalfe, it is to be conſidered that the Romaines deriuing themſelues from the Troians, Virgil himſelfe being a Romaine, doth therefore labour ſo much as in him lies to colour out the vnfaithfullnes of the Troyans, and would likewiſe deriue the Troian Princes from the line of the Pagan Gods, which they

themſelues had deified; but if Dardanus were the ſonne of Ioue (as their writers doe report) his Sonne Leomedon that proued periured, faithles and vntruſty, did farre digreſſe from any ſacred diſpoſition: ſo did Paris, that was Priams ſonne, who ſhewed himſelfe rather to proceede from the iſſue of a diuell, then from the line of a God, as it appeared in his behauiour, both to Oenone; who before had ſaued his life, and againe with Menelaus, that in ſuch a princely ſort had entertained him.
            And what ſhall I ſay of our great Grandſire Aeneas, from whome the Romaines would ſo faine deriue themſelues? and from whome (as ſome of our Engliſh writers would perſwade) our Britiſh nation did diſcend? let vs ſee what Virgil himſelfe doth teſtifie of him, whoſe penne is ſtained in the fineſt manner, to blazon forth the glory of Aeneas, yet doth hee not deſcribe him to bee the ſonne of a common ſtrumpet begotten by old Anchiſes of Venus, whom the Romaines haue diefied together with their great Goddes Flora, another bird of the ſame wing: but Aeneas, after he had betraied his countey, he himſelf with the reſt of his treacheious companions, were forced to wander at the ſea, robbing and ſpoyling, attending what Deſtiny would beſtow of him, landed in the end vpon the coaſt of Africa, at new built Carthage, where he likewiſe falſified his faith, and betrayed Dido, and ſo leauing Carthage, in the end arriued in Italy, where, by menacing threates mingled with faire promiſes, together with corruptions & gifts, he made ſuch diſcord & diſſention in the coūtry, by means wherof ſuch horible ſlaughters of the people wer cōmitted, that diſpoſſeſſing the quiet

princes thereof, hee eſtabliſhed himſelfe in the kingdome, raigning there vntill he died, after him, his fugitiue ſonne Aſcanius raigned, and his brother Siluiu Poſthumus ſucceeded him, that was afterwardes ſlain by his vnbleſſed Babe Brute, who for that fact was baniſhed Italy, and (as ſome writers would haue it) after hee had troubled many quiet countries, ariued in England, the called Albion, from whence they would deriue our Engliſh Petigrie: and this diſcent is not lightly accounted of by thoſe that are of little vnderſtanding, as though it were ſuch a dignity to be reputed the poſterity of a harlots brood: I like not the conceit, and I hold it to bee as fabulous, as that of Diocleſian the Sirian Prince, who (as ſome of our Engliſh Croniclers do affirme, committed thirty of his daughters to the ſea in a ſmall veſſell without Pylote or guide, who chancing to land in this Iſle, called it Albion (after one of their owne names) and after this arriuall of theſe thirty ſiſters, they were carnally knowne by Deuils, and brought forth a propagation of Giants, which were afterwardes ſlaine by Brutus.
            
            A ridiculous tale, and for matter and circumſtance, fitter to furniſh the Legenda Aurea, then to be inſerted for matter of truth in a Chronicle hiſtory, and it may well become the Romaines to bragge of their predeceſſor Aeneas; but for vs that be Engliſh (me thinks) there ſhould be ſmall pride to depend of that antique generoſity, that is ſo baſely deſcended: and againe, comparing of hiſtories, there is no poſſibility, how the tales can hang together: for the fictions of Poets, they are no groundes for Hiſtorians to build vppon, and therefore to returne againe to our firſt purpoſe, I

ſay, there are degrees of gentrie, aſwel as of dignities & honors, and that one is ſo much more a Gentleman by birth then another, by how much his Gentry is more ancient, more renowned, more manifeſt, and more mighty, which may bee ſaid, not onely in reſpect of birth, but likewiſe in reſpect of vertue.
            Gentlemen bee of three kindes, the firſt in reſpect of bloud, for ſo the vulgar ſort vnderſtands it; the ſecond, in reſpect of vertue, for ſo the philoſopher doth teach it: the third, in reſpect of both, and that (ſay I) is true Gentrie indeed.
            Gentrie by bloud belongeth but to the body; but gentrie by good conditions, hath relation to the mind: but when a man is gentill both by birth & vertue, I ſee not what may bee added vnto him: yet ſome would haue a third ſupply of riches & wealth, but riches can adde no degree to a Gentleman, and hee that woulde draw gentrie from wealth, is iniurious to the graces that are giuen vs from the heauens.
            But wealth is a ready inſtrument to put in practiſe certaine vertues belonging to gentrie, namely, bounty, and liberality: otherwiſe riches are rather a diſgrace then a grace to a Gentleman, that doth not beſtow them bountifully, as is befitting his eſtate.
            Yet thoſe that be of the ſcraping humour, wil ſomtimes pilfer a Text out of the holy Scripture, which, wreſting into a wrong ſenſe, they will alledge for themſelues, that their greedy heaping and gathering together, is but a chriſtianlike care, that euery man ſhould haue to prouide for his family.
            Theſe ſcraping excuſes are fitter for Churles then

for Gentlemen, (and yet me thinkes) Simonydes ſhifted himſelfe pretily, who being demanded, why he began to grow ſo miſerable in his latter yeares, to fall a hording vp of riches, when he was ready for the graue; to acquit himſelfe from a couetous diſpoſition, aunſwered, becauſe (ſaid he) I had rather haue goodes to leaue to mine enemies when I am dead, then to ſtand in need of my friendes, whilſt I am aliue.
            I cannot forget to giue Dioniſius his due commendation, who being aduertiſed of one that abounded in wealth, and yet liued a ſparing and a miſerable life, he commanded the party vpon paine of death, to bring in his riches, and to reſigneall that euer hee had to bee diſpoſed at his pleaſure: the party that durſt not directly contradict what the King had commaunded; made ſemblance to deliuer all that euer hee had, but ſecretly reſeruing a ſmall portion to himſelfe, wherewith departing into a remote place, hee after liued with that little pittance, (which he had concealed in a more bountifull manner, then euer he had done before when hee was poſſeſſed of his greateſt aboundance; which being certified to Dioniſius, hee ſent yet once againe for him, and giuing him all which before he had taken from him, he ſaid; now thou knoweſt how to vſe riches, take what is thine owne, for now thou well deſerueſt them.
            I might conclude, that if the enioying of wealth & riches, be matter ſufficient, to make a man to be gentilized, it were then a vilde thing to bee a Gentleman, becauſe they are ſeldome attained vnto, but by oppreſſion, extortion, deceit, fraud, & ſuch other corruption▪
               
there are compriſed vnder the title of Gentry, all Eccleſiaſtical perſons profeſſing religion, all Martial men that haue borne office, and haue had commaund in the field; all Students of Artes and Sciences, and by our Engliſh cuſtome, all Innes of Court men, profeſſors of the Law: It'skilles not what their Fathers were, whether Farmers, Shoomakers, Taylers or Tinkers, if their names be inrolled in any Inne of Court, they are all Gentlemen.
            The profeſſion of Armes being honourable, euery ordinary Souldier that hath ſerued ſeauen years without reproch, ought to be accounted a Gentleman, and by the lawes of Armes may challenge the combat of any Gentleman, in defence of his reputation.
            A Gentleman hauing aſpired to any title or dignity in the field, and in reſpect of age, or of any other infirmity is retired to his owne houſe, or to any other reſting place, ought neuertheleſſe to enioy that title and reputation, which he had formerly gained.
            Amongſt Students, there be many, that to attain wiſedome and knowledge, haue betaken themſelues to continuall ſtudy, and haue thereby attained to ſingular vertues, and for profound knowledge in many matters, be had in admiration: but that kind of vertue that extendeth it ſelfe to the common profit of al men, that is altogether occupied about the maintenance of the common wealth, hath his firſt preferment, but thoſe that doe but imploy the benefite of their ſtudies to ſome particular purpoſe, or to their own priuate gain, muſt giue place to the former. The true martialing of ſoueraigne honour, to place euery one in his right degree, and to giue him his due; the Diuine is firſt to haue

preferment, for the Miniſter of the word of God ought to haue the chiefeſt and moſt honourable place, eſpecially when they be ſuch as they ought to be, as Saint Paul writing to Timothie: They deſerue to haue double honour (faith he) where they reade or preach the Goſpell, & where their works and manner of liuing are conformable & agreeing to their doctrine. And as Saint Hierome ſaith; Great is the dignity of Prelates, but greater is their fall if they be wicked.
            
            But this honour thus rendered vnto them, they can not challenge as their proper right or due apertaining to themſelues, for that Prelate that is ambitious of worldly honour and eſtimation, doth rather ſmell of the Spirite of Antichriſt, then ſhew himſelfe to bee a follower to our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, whoſe preſcriptions are humility: for hee that exalteth him ſelfe, or deſireth to bee great amongſt you, let him be brought low (ſayeth our Sauiour) let him bee your ſeruant.
            It is manifeſt, that in Mathew and Marke, he reproueth the ambition of the Sonnes of Zebedie, who ambitiouſly deſired the one to ſit on his right hand, the other on his left; and as Chriſt elſewhere condemneth the ambitious affections of ſuch as ambitiouſly deſire to exalt themſelues, and to ſeeke ſuperiority: ſo doth he in like ſort condemne all other, what or who ſoeuer, that are ſo puft vp with pride and arrogancy, that they diſdaine to giue place and reuerence to thoſe that haue iuriſdiction and magiſtracy in the Church of God: and there is no leſſe pride and contempt in thoſe that will refuſe to giue honour and reuerence to him that is in authority to beare office and rule in the

miniſtery, then there is in him on the other ſide, that doth ambitiouſly deſire to rule, but not to profite the Church; the which, ſo farre as my little skill will afforde me, may moſt aptly bee applyed to the Pope & his ſhauelings.
            But he that hath any ſpirituall charge, or hath the cure of ſoules in the Church of God, I ſay with Saint Paul, He is worthy of double honour, and he that diligently preacheth the Goſpel and conformeth his life according to his doctrine (I ſay ſtill) wee cannot reuerence him enough, nor render him too much honor.
            Our Sauiour himſelfe would in no wiſe take vpon him to iudge betweene the brethren that came vnto him about the diuiſion of their land; neither is there any example in all the New Teſtament, where any of the Apoſtles (after their calling) intermedled wich matters appertaining to temporall Magiſtracy, but applyed their whole endeauors to the preaching of the Goſpell; the auncient Romaines had that obſeruation, for they would in no wiſe admit that their Flamius, nor any other of their ſacrificing Prieſts, ſhold beare any rule or gouernement in the common wealth, but that they ſhould onely exerciſe themſelues in the ſeruice of their Gods: but this prohibition was not done in any diſgrace, whereby to abate or diminiſh the leaſt iot of their honor or eſtimation, for king Dridanias cenſuring of profeſſions, which might bee moſt worthie, gaue the higheſt degree of honour to the Prieſts, that did dayly offer ſacrifice in the temples of their Gods.
            If the Heathen did thus much exalt and dignifie the reputation of theſe prophane Prieſts that were but

dedicated to the ſeruice of Idols, and Pagan Gods, what eſtimation, what reuerence, what honour may wee render to thoſe that are the Ambaſſadors of the Almighty God? that are ſent vnto vs with the glad and ioyfull tidings of our ſaluation? that are our Fathers to begetvs to Ieſus Chriſt, by the preaching of his Goſpell? that are his Stewardes to diſpence his holy myſteries amongſt vs: to whome wee are not onely to attribute honour, but for whome wee are alſo bound to pray: if they doe not make themſelues vnworthy of it by their owne contempt, by their couetouſnes, by their pride, and by their ambition, as there bee ſome that haue ſet themſelues oppoſite to the ordinance of the Church, that haue ſet the holy ſcriptures at a iarre, that will many times make the gloſe to ouerthrow the Text, that will cry out for Diſcipline, yet will obey no Diſcipline, that will take vpon them to teach al men, yet they themſelues wil not be taught, that are angry againſt Biſhoppes, and would not haue them to be Lordes, yet are become ſo Lady like themſelues, that they would haue euery one a new faſhion particular to himſelfe: theſe are to proud in their own conceites, theſe be they that diſdaining to yeelde to authority▪ do ſhew greater pride in their contempt, thē the other can ſhew in their moſt ambitious deſires.
            Saint Paul writing to Timothie: Hee that deſireth the office of a Biſhoppe, that man deſireth a good worke: I hope the office of a Biſhoppe is not altogether without authority, and that authority in the Church of God, is not altogether vnworthy of honour: and where Chriſt prohibited his Diſciples, that they ſhould not be caled Rabbi, that they ſhould not be called Doctors,

&c. by the opinion of the moſt learned writers, thoſe words of Chriſt doe not condemne ſuperiority, lordſhip, or any other like authority, but the ambitious deſire onely; neither doth he ſay elſewhere, that no man ſhould be great, or beare rule amongſt them: but his words are; He that deſireth to be great amongst you, let him be humbled, And Timothie notwithſtanding thoſe words ſpoken by Chriſt, calleth himſelfe the Doctor of the Gentiles; and Paul in like manner writing to the Corinthians, calleth himſelfe their Father.
            Now as the holy Scriptures exhorteth the profeſſors of the Goſpell to be humble & meeke, ſo we ought to render them the firſt title of honour, and to giue thē precedence in the formoſt ranke, eſpecially to thoſe that do not ambitiouſly deſire it. Loe, heare now the difference betweene the Diſciples of Chriſt, and the followers of Antichriſt, the one refuſeth the prefermēts of the world, that are offered vnto them by the Deuill, and contenteth themſelues with their vocation in the miniſtery: the other with the Pope, accepteth of al that is offered, & beſides their eccleſiaſticall promotions, they hunt after temporall iuriſdictions, & other proud titles of the world, to vphold and maintain their pride and ambition, for the better manifeſtation whereof, I thinke it will not bee out of ſeaſon to remember a ieſt, that was merily broken by a plaine Country fellow, vpon one of the Popes Chaplaines, the Biſhoppe of Cullen, who paſſing on a iourney ſumptuouſly mounted, and gorgeouſly furniſhed, both himſelf and al the reſt that were in his company, was encountered by a rude country fellow, who comming to the Biſhop, after hee had bluntly ſaluted him, he ſaide, my Lord,

I haue heard ſpeaking of Peter and Paul, and of ſome others that were reputed to be good and godly men, I may well commend their goodnes, but I will neuer prayſe their wit, for they were glad to amble about the country on foot, for falling followed (perhaps) with ſome poore thred bare fellowes like themſelues, but I ſee God hath prouided for your Lordſhip better then for them, or your wiſedome is the more to prouide ſo well for your ſelfe.
            The Biſhop that heard himſelfe to bee thus pretily nipt, returned this anſwere; but ſirra (ſaid he) you miſtake your text, you thinke I take more ſtate vppon me, then is befitting an Apoſtle; but let Peter & Paul goe or ride how they liſt, I am not only the Biſhoppe of Cullen, but I am ouer and beſides a Prince Elector: and for this ſtate that you thinke I take vpon mee, as you thinke it to be too much for a Biſhoppe, ſo I know it to be too little for a prince, and thus you are anſwered: you haue anſwered well (ſaid the other), but good my Lord but one queſtion more, if this prince Elector, that you ſpeake of, do happen to goe to the Deuill for his pride, what will become of my Lord Biſhop of Cullen?
            We might make the like demaund to the Pope, who notwithſtanding his humble p
                  •
               etence to bee Seruus Seruorum Dei, yet hee aſſumeth to himſelfe the diſpoſe of the whole world, & not contented with that neither but he further taketh vppon him to haue commaund both in Heauen and Hell, to let in, and ſhut out, as it pleaſeth him: but becauſe his intollerable pride is well inough knowne, I may be the more ſparing: it was the bounty and liberality of princes, that firſt begat

this ambition in Popes: ſo, ambition was it again, that firſt deſtroyed Religion: but for the tru profeſſors of the Goſpell (I proteſt) I thinke it a ſinne, to carry any ill conceit againſt thē, whoſe praiers vnto God doth ſo appeaſe his diſpleaſure towardes vs, that hee many times forbeareth to puniſh vs, when wee haue worthily deſerued it: and as the prayers of Moſes did rather procure the victory againſt Amalecke, then all the ſwordes that did accompany Ioſua to the fight: ſo I beleeue that the petition of one godly man, deliuered with a confident zeale, is of more effect then the prayers of a multitude, that are but breathed in words, and are rather vttered from the mouth, then proceeding from the heart.
            Hauing thus placed the Diuine in the formoſt rank; the Souldier is next to be preferred: for honor cannot be wanting in thoſe men of valour, that haue reſtored to their country their bloud, which their conntrie firſt gaue vnto them: if wee ſtand vpon birth onely, then the moſt auncient, whether in Nobility or Gentility: if we ſtand vpon deſert, then the martiall man, hee that doth deliuer his country from the ſeruitude of ſtrangers, the oppreſſion of Tyrantes, that doth countermaund the miſeries of ciuill diſſentions, that doth reſtraine the pride▪ and ambition of aſpiring traitors, that doth inlarge their territories, defend their liberties, vphold and maintaine Iuſtice, and make honorable defence againſt all inuaders.
            The Souldier is the man that holdeth the whole world in awe, and is not onely a ſure defence againſt forraine inuaſions, but likewiſe againſt domeſticall rebellions: wee need not in this caſe to ſeeke after

farre fet precedents, when wee haue home examples inough of our own, who hath not heard of Iack Straw, Iacke Cade and of Ket, with many others now of later times in Ireland, that if the Souldiers ſworde had not beene of greater vertue, then a writ out of the Kinges Bench, to haue brought them before my Lord Chiefe Iuſtice, they would neither haue made appearance nor haue paid fees.
            I ſay then, that the execution of Iuſtice lieth in Arms▪ but (me thinkes) I ſee a Lawyer laugh at this, for thoſe that bee of the ſorrier ſort of Lawyers, will in no wiſe that the Souldier ſhould bee a maintainer of Iuſtice, for that they onely would arrogate to themſelues: but for the better credite of the matter, I will ſalute my Maiſters of the Law with a few wordes deliuered by S. Ambroſe, and thus they follow.
            
               Valiant men that do defend their Country, and protect the Weale from ſpoile and ruine, doe the office of true iuſtice; Souldiers do protect the common wealth, and they defend it from all ſorts of ſpoile, eyther forraine or inteſtine, but onely, they cannot ſaue it from the ſpoyle of the Lawyers.
            Hauing thus placed the Deuine and now the Souldier, in the third ranke are to march, thoſe that doe compoſe and compound lawes and ordinances, for the maintenance of right and ciuill ſociety▪ amongſt theſe the venerable and reuerend Iudges, and all other that are eſtabliſhed in office and authority vnder Princes, but eſpecially, if they execute their places with honour and honeſty.
            The Lawyers will neuer thinke mee to be a good Sariant Maior, to martiall them thus in the Rereward,

that would ranke themſelues with the formoſt; eſpeciall, in the time of peace, for they take themſelues to bee the onely Agents of a happy gouernment.
            It is our wickednes that maketh the Lawyer neceſſary; ſo neceſſity is it, that maketh him honourable, & therefore he is not to march in equall ranke, neither with the Souldier, nor with the Philoſopher.
            The principall office of the Law is, in the time of peace to commaund thinges honeſt and vertuous, and to forbid what is diſhoneſt and vicious; but what can the Lawyer doe with his preſcriptions, before there be a ſetled obedience, which is firſt to bee eſtabliſhed by the Souldier?
            It is truth, the Lawyer and the Souldier could neuer thriue both in one ſhire, and therefore no maruell though they crie out with Tully, Caedant arma togae, for, theſe doe not onely loue to ſleepe in a whole skin, and are afraid of knockes, but vnder the pretence of honouring peace, they would both excuſe their cowardize, and would arrogate to themſelues a ſupreame authority, to be the principall pillars to conſerue and vphold peace; and becauſe Tully would haue it, that weapons ſhould giue place to the gown, they would from hence conclude, that the Souldier muſt giue place to the Lawyer; but as good lucke would haue it, Tully himſelfe in the ſame booke of Officis, hath bequeathed a double honour vnto thoſe men, who armed do make warre, and robbed do gouerne the common wealth: and the Poets haue fained Minerua to be armed, ſignifying, that Captains and Souldiers, ſhould be as wiſe in counſailing, as couragious in conquering as politike in keeping, as valiant in getting.
            
               
But to put all queſtions out of doubt, and that the Lawyer ſhould not thinke himſelfe diſgraſt, by giuing place to the Souldier, I wil proue by ſufficient inſtance that the profeſſion of Armes is more honourable then the profeſſion of Law, and ſo by conſequence the Soldier is of greater worth and excellency then the Lawyer.
            The affaires of warre is a knowledge behoueful for the greateſt Monarch, when a king is not ſo much renowned for his crowne, as for his skill in knowledge of Armes. The nine Worthies of the worlde, were Martiall men, reputed honourable for their prowes, not for their knowledge eyther in Law or Philoſophy though the knowledge of them both be of great excellency.
            Although all the gifts of Fortune are to be deſpiſed in reſpect of learning; yet there is nothing ſo glorious, as to bee called a great Captaine, or a worthie Souldier: and it was very neatly anſwered by him, who being demanded by his friend, whether hee had rather to be Achilles or Homer; asked the other again, whether he had rather to be a Captaine or a Trumpeter: letters are but the ornaments of Armes, and learning is more neceſſary for a man of Warre, then for any other profeſſion.
            The aduentures vndertaken by warre, the true prouocation is glory; but he that ſauoureth not the fruits of letters, hath as little feeling in the greatnes of glory. A man that is ignorant in Artes, can neuer excell in Armes, and as Plato ſayeth; Happy is that common wealth, where eyther the Prince is a Philoſopher, or where a Philoſopher is a prince: ſo it may be called

a fortunate warre, where the chiefe Commander is a great ſcholler, or a great ſcholler is the chiefe Commaunder.
            What made the Romaines to become ſo famous, but that their Captaines and Commaunders were as great ſchollers as they were warriours? it is not exerciſe in warre, that maketh euery man fit to be a Captaine, though he follow the profeſſion neuer ſo long, eſpecially, if he be vnlearned; yet there is none ſo vnapt for the warre, but if he be lettered, it ſo much the more helpeth his experience.
            A man that is aged (let his yeares be neuer ſo many) yet he ſeeth but the thinges that are done in his owne time, but the learned man ſeeth not onely his owne age and experience, but whatſoeuer hath beene done many hundred yeares paſt, yea ſince the firſt Writer tooke penne in hand: and therefore aſwell amongſt Souldiers, as amongſt all other profeſſions, the vnlearned muſt giue place to the learned, for no memorie can compare with writing. And as amongſt the vnlearned, he that hath liued foureſcore yeares, muſt haue more experience, then hee that hath liued but forty: ſo hee that ſeeth by bookes the accidents of a thouſand yeares, knoweth more then hee that by liuing a hundred yeares is able to attaine vnto.
            I might inferre examples of excellent Captaines of old time, which all enioyed the ornament of letters, with the prowes of Armes.
            It is well knowne that Alexander had Homer in ſuch reuerent eſtimation, that hee laid his Iliades alwayes vnder his beds head; and hee applyed diligently not thoſe ſtudies onely, but alſo the ſpeculation of philoſophy,

vnder the diſcipline of Ariſtotle.
            
            
               Alcibiades in like manner increaſed his vnderſtanding, aſwel by letters, as with the inſtructions of Socrates. What diligence Caeſar vſed in ſtudy, his owne writinges doe ſufficiently make manifeſt.
            
               Scipto Affricanus would not goe without the bookes of Xenophon.
            
            I might further ſpeake of Lucullus, Scilla, Pompeius, Brutus, and of many other both Romaines and Gretians, that were famous Souldiers and great Philoſophers, & how conuerſant a matter it hath been in times paſt for Arts & Arms to march together in one ranke.
            This might ſuffice to proue that the dignity of the ſoldier is not beſtowed vpon him gratis, or (as it were) without deſert; but that it appertaineth vnto him by property and right, and but according to his owne merite; then who is more fit to manage the affaires of peace, as hee that hath an able iudgement to know what is fit both for peace and warre.
            But it hath beene a former queſtion, & diſputation hath beene had many yeares ſithens, what profeſſion might be thought to be moſt worthy; and ſundry men haue hereupon giuen their ſeuerall cenſures.
            King Oridanias was wont to ſay to the Cicilians, that to the ſacrificing Prieſtes of the Temple, moſt honour was due; whereby it may appeare, that the religious from the beginning were had in reuerent eſtimation: & it was not giuen them without ſome conſideration, for as it is recorded, the Prieſtes of Diana were limited to their ſeuerall ſeaſons, the firſt wherein they might learn wiſedom, the ſecond, wherein to exerciſe it them ſelues, and the third, to inſtruct others▪ 
               Brias king of Argiues,
               
gaue moſt honor to the Philoſophers that read in ſchooles. Numa Pompilius amongſt the Romains, was of opinion, that he was worthy of moſt reputation, to whom had happened the victory of any famous battel and that was fortunate in warre.
            But Anaxarchus the Philoſopher, ordained amongſt the Phenitians, that in a common wealth, ſuch ſhoulde be eſpecially honoured, who in the time of peace entertained the ſtate in tranquility; and in the fury of war, was found to bee a valiant protector of the limites and liberties of his country, concurring with that of Tully, who likewiſe preferreth to the higheſt degree of honour; thoſe, who armed doe make warre, and robbed, do rule and gouerne the common wealth: but becauſe this little pauſe of peace, hath euen almoſtlulde vs in that ſecurity, that now the ſouldier hath hanged vp his armor a ruſting by the wals, they would likewiſe hang himſelfe a ruſting with his Armes, I thinke it not amiſſe therefore to giue him a litle furbuſhing, though not to caſt him into any counterfeit colour, or ſo to verniſh or gild him, wherby to make him more bright by Art then he is of himſelfe by Nature: a litle therefore to rub out the canker, that time hath already begun for to eate, I will make him as well as I can, to gliſter and ſhine in his own vertue.
            Warre is a miniſter of Gods iuſtice for ſinne, God is not the author of ill, but the chaſticer of abuſe; he ordereth the will of Princes to puniſh or reuenge: the Souldiers as obedient Subiectes, are the Miniſter to performe: if power were not to maintaine Princes proceedinges, the Prince might ſometimes bee diſpoſſeſt of his Eſtate; cruell handes woulde bee

layed on the Miniſtery, yea, the Lawyers woulde bee pulde from the Barre, and the Iudge pluckt downe from the place of Iuſtice; ſo that in peace the name of a Souldier reſtreyneth the rebellions, and in warre, maketh ſubiect the proudeſt reſiſter.
            The Souldier referreth himſelfe to the will of the prince, the prince is not diſpoſed but by the direction of God, who ſince hee is the gouernour of euery actiō, I dare auow they are not vicious.
            It may be obiected, that in the proud attemptes of Princes, the Souldier is ſtill preſent, not reſpecting the cauſe ſo much as his owne profite.
            This were a hard poſition to bee obiected againſt Lawyers, but the Souldier being a ſubiect, is tied to follow his Prince: but in iniurious enterpriſes, I know there are Souldiers, that are as contrary to the warre as he that is moſt ready to reprehend: who by proofe and not by geſſe, do conclude of the euent of the battel when the cauſe proceedeth from a wrongfull ground.
            But let vs ſpeake of Souldiers in their minorities, when they firſt become to bee apprentiſes to Armes. In the choice of a Souldier, wee do not onely regard the ability of his body, but the quality of his minde: for if religion, circumſpection, preuention, counſell, experience, zeale, fidelity, reſolution, continency and care, be not in him that ſhould enter the profeſſion, the charge is ill lookt into; neither is ſuch a one to bee admitted, that is not thus accompliſht: then if a Soldier of iudgement be had, when he is imployed, how liues he in the field? firſt, in the feare of God, not aſſured of his life from one houre to another, ſurely tied to al vertuous actions, abſtinent in diet, diligent to

pleaſe, carefull to correct, dutifull to obey, tired with trauell, handes, feet, legges, thoughts and all, toyled, occupied, and employed, ſo that neither leiſure ſerues him to be idle, nor the ſeuerity of his Captaine admits him to runne aſtray: ſuch Souldiers ſhould be, and thus they ought to be employed, and if there were not ſome ſuch, the name and title were hardly beſtead.
            For thoſe imputations wherewith Souldiers are charged, to be raſh, rebellious, cruell, mutinous, incontinent &c. they are but ſcandals malitiouſly impoſed: for firſt, if they were raſh, their ſucceſſe would be more infortunate, then commonly it falleth out.
            If rebellious, and not to bee gouerned, without doubt, Alexander had not conquered ſo many countries, ſubdued ſo many kingdomes, and ouercome ſo many nations, and (as it were) but with a handfull of his Macedonians and Cretians.
            If bloudy minded, why then ſpared Caeſar thoſe Senators, & citizens of Rome, when both by their own hand▪writing and often attempts, hee well knew to be the followers of Pompei, and his capitall enemies.
            If murtherous, how often might the Venetian Armies haue worthily ſpoiled the whole Iland of Create, which not onely had murthered many of their families with the ſword, but alſo rebelled againſt them fiue or ſixe ſeuerall times.
            Ifincontinent, what cauſed Scipio to redeliuer that noble young Virgin, who for her paſſing beauty, and great admiration of perſon, was preſented vnto him as a rare gift; Scipio himſelfe amaſed at the ſight, would yet deliuer her to Luceias, to whome ſhee was eſpouſed, and gaue him alſo for a dowrie, the gold that her

parents had brought to redeeme her.
            If couctous, how fell it out, that after L. Mumius had taken Corinth, and adorned all Italy with the riches of that ſpoile, he kept ſo little to his own vſe, that the Senate was faine for very need, to giue dowry to his daughter of the common treaſure.
            But becauſe Rome hath beene eſpecially famed, let vs ſee from whence ſhee attained to her greatnes, we ſhall find that the Souldier was he that defended the eſtate, the Souldier was hee that made Rome notable: yea, the Souldier was he that had the creation of the Emperour. When the ſouldier had this ſway, peace was as plentifull at Rome as after it was, the reuenews of Rome greater then now they be, the abhomination of Rome leſſe then now it is: In the time of the ſouldiers gouernment, Rome was renowned for her iuſtice, and was reputed to bee the miſtris of the world: now the rule is in the hand of a counterfeit prieſt, Rome is inſamed for her idolatry, and is accounted the ſcorne of the world: In the dayes of Traian, other countries ſought their lawes from Rome, now in the dayes of the Vicar of Chriſt, Rome is accounted lawles of all the world.
            In the loſſe of a ſouldier, how mourned Iulius Caeſar? whome not onely he dignified with great honors being aliue, but alſo buried with bitter teares being dead.
            
               Pompei the great builded the city of Nicopolis to no other end but to harbour ſouldiers.
            
               Alexander the Romaine, would ſeldome giue giftes vnles it were to ſouldiers, affirming it to be vnlawfull for him that was high ſteward of the common wealth to conuert thoſe reuenewes which the Prouinces

did contribute, eyther to his owne ſpottes and pleaſures, eyther yet to ſpend and conſume them amongſt his friendes and fauourites.
            Yea, the moſt notable Emperours, that euer yet were heard on, hath accounted of a Souldier as of his familiar, calling him his companion, and fellow in Armes. Now I haue heard of them, that haue been learned in the lawes, and ſome others likewiſe that haue beene famous Orators, that haue been entertained by Princes, but neuer reputed to be their fellowes, yet many times accounted to be their flatterers, to ſooth thē vp in their pleaſurs, and to follow and vphold them in their idle humors.
            Perhaps, for the maintenance of a good Plea, a lawyer may get a little popular praiſe; but the ſouldier, for ſubduing an enemy to Rome, had the honor of a Triumph. I might here enlarge a great deale of other matter fitting to my purpoſe: but will you heare what teſtimony the holy Scriptures will affoorde vs in the commendation of Souldiers? in the 3. of Luke, amongſt a number of all ſorts of people that came to Iohn Baptist, aſwell to heare him preach, as alſo to bee baptiſed, the ſoldiers were not behind, but ſtired vp with the like godly zeale, they came amonſt the reſt, deſirous to bee inſtructed in the way of their ſaluation, and as the other had done before them, they demaunded of Iohn what they might do to inherite heauen; the Prophet rendring no rough reply, mildly ſaid vnto them, Doc no violence, but be content with your pay.
            
            If I ſhold a litle paraphraſe of this Text I might eaſily make it appeare, that ſouldiers are not ſo puffed vp with deſire of a little tranſitory glory, that they neglect

the glory that ſhall endure world without end.
            The Captaine againe, that ſent vnto Ieſus aboute helping of his ſicke ſeruant, as our Sauiour was comming towards his houſe, hee was encountred by a ſecond meſſenger, acknowledging himſelfe vnworthy to receiue him vnder his roofe, beſeeching him but only to ſpeake the word, and he knew his ſeruant ſhould be ſafe, whereat our Lord himſelfe wondred, and turning him to thoſe that followed, he ſaid, I haue not found ſo great faith, no, not in Iſrael.
            
            There is yet mention made in the Acts of the Apoſtles, of Cornelius a Captaine, a deuout man, & one that feared God, with all his houſhold, to whom an Angell appearing, willed him to ſend to Ioppa for Simon Peter, who ſhould inſtruct him, and baptiſe him in the name of Ieſus Chriſt; and the Captaine called vnto him a deuout Souldier (for thoſe be the wordes of the Text) whome he ſent with others, about this meſſage.
            This Teſtimony we haue in the new Teſtament of Souldiers that were godly enclined: but I doe not finde mention made of any Lawyer, but of thoſe that came amongſt the Scribes and Phariſies, that ſought ſtill to tempt and crucifie Chriſt, againſt whome our Sauiour himſelfe, pronounced, VVoe be to you Lawyers, for you loade men with beaute burdens to be borne: but you your ſelues will not touch them with your little fingers.
            
            I haue trauelled a large circuit, and by what is already paſt, it might well inough appeare, that he is moſt beneficiall to his Country, whoſe body executeth what his wiſedome plotteth, I might yet holde on a larger iourney, but I thinke it needles, and therefore I meane to weary my ſelfe no further.
            
               
But I cannot ſee what the Lawyer can challenge of his country, the lawyer (I meane) that makes his plea but for his priuate profite, whole onely contemplation hath but regard to his owne cofers.
            In the beginning, when Iuſtinians Radices were not knowne, but the law of the Tables were taught, then the law was not in the ciuill magiſtrate to diſpoſe, but the Prieſt had it to propound: that law was deliuered by ſucceſſion, and confirmed by the preſence of the Law-giuer: and whilſt that law was continued, Iſrael was partaker of the promiſe; the Heathen fell before them, for the Lord of hoſtes was amongſt them, but in continuance of time, as ſinne and corruption began to encreaſe, the lawes likewiſe began to multiply: for it is offence that begetteth lawes, and from the wickednes of men, it is that good laws do proceed.
            
               Dioniſius of Siracuſa (though otherwiſe a tyrant) yet hee made a Law, that thoſe that exceſſiuely gaue them ſelues to banqueting, ſhould bee puniſhed with great aſperity: Licurgus made a Law againſt drunkennes, Auguſtus Caeſar againſt pompious buildings, the Lucanes againſt prodigality, the Lacedemonians againſt exceſſe in apparrell, the Egyptians againſt whoredome & adultery, the Thebians, againſt negligent parents, that brought vp their children in idlenes and inſolencie, the Romaines againſt thoſe maiſters, that were too ſeuere and cruell to their ſeruants; and there was a Law eſtabliſhed in Rome, called Iulia, the tenor wherof was, that no man ſhould be ſo hardy to ſhut vp his dores, whilſt they were at dinner, that the officers of the City might haue the more eaſie acceſſe to ſee if their ordinary did not exeede their ability.
            
               
I might ſpeake of the lawes of Draco, of thoſe that were made by Numa Pompilius, and of infinite numbers beſide that were made by ſeuerall men at ſondrie times, and for diuers purpoſes, ſo that law is but leue▪led by direction, adminiſtred by appointment, and ſtil referred to reformation.
            This Canon may be anihilated by this learned Doctor, that diſtinction fruſtrated by that Expoſitor, and what not turned Topſieturuy, to ſerue the ſeaſon for the Lawyers commodity.
            There is no agreement amongſt themſelus, for what they confirm to day, to morrow they diſauow; looke into their own Canons, conſider of the firſt inſtitution of their laws politique, poſitiue, and prouinciall, and there will be found ſo many corrections, ſo many fruſtrations, ſo many anticipations, ſo many cauteles, and ſuch ſeuerall expoſitions, as the ſtudient had need euery day of a new memory, to conſider of his newe coated clauſe. With this multiplicity of laws, there is likewiſe crept in ſuch a ſuperaboundance of Lawyers, that by wreſting and corrupting of the lawes, doe maintaine themſelues, their wiues and their family, in preſumption and pride.
            Theſe bee they that with Protulus the ſonne of Nerua, by their iniurious cauillations, wil deſtroy the cauſe of Otho their familiar friend, and will not let wickedly to betray him to Vitelius for a little gaine.
            Theſe be they that with Chriſtopher of Caſtill, haue bound themſelues apprentiſes to variety, and with Eneius Popilius, will know nothing without a golden Fee.
            Theſe be they that with Baldus Peruſinas, are aſwell

hated for their inconſtancy, as honoured for their learning, and with Saturius (that was neuer heard to deliuer a profitable ſentence in Law) doth yet vphold their ambition by the ſcrapinges of the law.
            Theſe be they that with Hortenſius pleade hard for Verres, for the fee of a ſiluer Spinx, and with Augilius Rats wil nonſute his Clients cauſe, if he denay him but to change a peece of baſe mony.
            Theſe be they, by whoſe corruptions, the lawes are made but Traps and Traines, where by both rich and poore are caught and ſpoiled, and how many Athenian Orators haue we, that wil counterfeit the Squinancy for a litle gaine, and yet are to open mouthed againſt the poore mans proceſſe, that will make their plea, but according to the peny, that will come delayes from Tearme to Tearme, from time to time, from yeare to yeare, that haue ſo many ſhifts, and are ſo ful of colluſion, that I proteſt, I doe not know any thing wherein wee ſtand in greater need, then of prouident and godly lawes, whereby to curbe and reſtrain the corruptions of the greateſt number of our Lawyers, but eſpecially from the deteſtable exactions of thoſe that bee Clarkes and vnder officers, that are cryed out vpon by poore ſutors, for their extorting & taking of vnreaſonable fees.
            But as I haue heard there hath beene ſome reformation of theſe things in England, and I hope there will be the like had in Ireland, where this extorting by Clarks, is in ſuch vſe and cuſtome, that ſome of the diſcreet ludges themſelues, haue found faulte at it, and I my ſelfe haue heard no worſe man then the Kinges Atturney Generall of that realm that did both

nor Iudge to dete mine it, in ſuch a caſe (by the lawes of all nations, the triall is ſtill referred to the lawes of Armes, from a Company of wrangling Aduocates, that with their ſophiſtications doe hunt after continual darknes, to the honourable preſcriptions ſet down by Souldiers, that to diſcouer falſhood, to bring hidden practiſes to open light, to make their trials by way of Combat, preſuppoſing that God, who onely knoweth the ſecrets of all things, will giue victory to him that aduentureth his life for iuſtice and right.
            This ſuppoſition is not vainely grounded, for hiſtories are full of examples: how many vngratious and vngodly practiſes haue beene diſcouered and laide open, and of many other trials that haue beene made by thoſe honourable incounters of Combat, & ſomtimes determined by Martiall court?
            But the Souldiers confidence is not to be forgotten, who referring the equity of his cauſe to the righteous iudgement of God, doe neither ſeeke for loue, nor for fauour, nor for gaine, neither arethey drawne by any manner of corruption, to obſcure matters, to darken them, or to ſhut them vp in a golden cloude: or after three or foure yeares continuance in ſute, to make them more intricate then they were the very firſt day they were commenced.
            No, the martiall law is of a more ſpeedy diſpatch, it ſeeketh no corners, it neither vpholdeth wrong, nor ſuppreſſeth right: I may therefore conclude with a good conſcience, that if there be not ſome difference in the lawes themſelues, yet in the adminiſtration there is a great inequality.
            I would not wiſh you to belecuc for all this, that I

would haue all ſutes, all quarrels, and all manner of controuerſies to be tried by martiall law: doe you aske me, how I would then haue them ended? I proteſt I will tell you what I would doe my ſelfe in ſuch a caſe; I would walke Powles till I were weary, but I woulde meet with him that wold ſay, had don him wrong, or betweene whome and my ſelfe, there were like to ariſe any cauſe of contention or ſute in law; and hauing once found him, he ſhould be very hard hearted, but I would intice him to a Tauerne, where calling for a potle of wine, and placing it at the vpper end of the Table, I would make it an arbitrator between vs for that time, and I would likewiſe draw in ſome other of our friendes and acquaintance, that if the wine ſhoulde be too hote or too furious in his execution, they ſhould moderate and qualifie his rigour with ſome indifferency: you know my meaning, if it were a matter of a thouſand pounds weight, I had rather abide a triall amonſt neighbours and friendes, (that might make a quicke diſpatch) and a quiet end, then to follow a ſute at Weſtminſter Hall, that will ſcarſe be finiſhed in an age, eſpecially, if the matter bee doubtfull or intricate. To conclude, I would not wiſh a wiſe man to goe to Law at all, if it were poſſible; marry, if there bee no remedy, arme your ſelfe with patience, and ſtore your purſe with crownes; for be ſure, you ſhall haue occaſion to vſe both the one and the other: for the Lawyer and the Vintner too, are very coſtly if they bee well followed, and they do both of them make their greateſt gainby ſelling of the Elements, for the one ſels water, and the other ſels wind; but caueat Emptor, for he that ſels wine, though it be but by the pint, wil game

more at the yeares end, then hee that buyes it by the pottle: but he that liues by venting of law, woe be to the buyer, for they retaile ſuch rotten ſtuffe, they will make you pay for the very dregs & droſſe of their law; they ſell the very parings, the ſcraping, and the of
                  •
               courings of the law at vnreaſonable rates: you ſhall pay for euery leafe, for euery line, for euery word, for euery ſillable, for euery ſcrape, for euery daſh with a penne, for euery drop of inke; you ſhall pay for their toying, for their trifling, for their delaying, ſometimes for their lying; you muſt attend at their chambers, you muſt wait for them at their ſtudy dores, you muſt bee ſure to haue their fees in readines, for he that wants mony amongſt Lawyers, is like a flower in the Froſt, nipt in one night, and withered the next day.
            
               Cato ſeeing the inconuenience that grew in the common wealth by the prouocation of Lawyers, that animated and maintained diſhoneſt ſutes & quarrels amongſt neighbors and friends; wiſhed that the courts of Pleas might be ſet with trappes and ingines, to catch and inſnarle the profeſſors of that ſtudy of law: and Fardinando ſending a vyz-Roy into the Indies then newly diſcouered, he forbad him to carry any Lawyers with him, to the end they might not ſow the ſeedes of ſutes.
            I hope I ſhall not be miſtaken (by thoſe that are wiſe) nor my wordes conſtrued to the worſt meaning (by thoſe that are honeſt) for I am not ignorant of manie worthie Gentlemen that are profeſſors of the law, and I thinke both the ſtudy and adminiſtration of law, to be moſt befitting and behouefull for Gentlemen: for what are they but this baſe borne broode, that creeping

into the Innes of Court, and hauing a little ſcraped together a few fragments & ſcrapings of the law, becauſe they would not mend ſhoos, foot ſtockinges, driue the cart, and do as their fathers did before them; they neither care what lawes they peruert, nor what Clients they conſume; theſe be they againſt whome I haue all this while whetted my penne; with others I haue not had to deale.
            For the graue and reuerent Iudges, Fathers and Founders of the Law, my penne hath not touched, no, far be it from me to thinke an euill thought, much leſſe to detect them. There be many other Gentlemen, both of name and bloud that I know are not to be detected; amongſt the which, ſome I loue for their honeſty, ſome I reuerence for their quality, and ſome I honour for their excellency many wayes expreſſed, but eſpecially in their liues: amongſt the reſt that are now remainant in the realme of Ireland, one that hath made himſelfe more famous then the reſt, and therefore aboue the reſt in that Region moſt worthy ſo to be famed. I need not blaze his name, for he that hath but learned to know himſelfe, hath heard of him. I might ſay more but I need not, for he hath ſaid more for himſelfe then I am able to ſay.
            For a full concluſion of this, I proteſt, that I doe not know any man in Englād, a profeſſor of the law, either one or other that I do malice; there be a number that I do loue, and I loue them for their owne vertue and worthines: neyther can I ſpeake any ill of any one particular perſon amongſt them of mine owne experience; neither haue I heard the abuſes of theſe pettyfogging fellowes more bitterly reprehended, then I

haue heard amongſt Lawyers themſelues that are of the moſt worthieſt ſorte, and beſt learned in the lawes.
            And now to returne to the ſubiect that I haue taken in hand, I ſay it is the beſt gentrie that is attayned by Armes or by learning, but beſt of all by both, and hee doth hardly deſerue the title of a Gentleman, that is not aduanced by one or both; they are farre deceiued to thinke, that a little wealth, or a bare office, may make a man worthy of eſtimation, that is not attained vnto by deſert, or accompliſhed by vertue: to gaine a reputation, to bee accounted wiſe or vertuous, many wiſe and vertuous acts are required; but for a man to make himſelfe to bee eſteemed for a foole, one fooliſh act ſufficeth: and therefore a man had neede to take heede how hee marries a wife, that is of the flanting humour.
            Some do think to aſpite to gentility by their welth, but that were a baſe foundation, for riches are moſt cō
               monly heaped together by corruptions, by extortions by exactions, by oppreſſions, and by many other like, ſeruile functions.
            And a man would laugh to heare ſome of theſe Hogelings (if they bee in company) what they will attribute to themſelues, you ſhall ſee a fellow that was but lately digde out of a dung hill, whoſe wit and honeſty both, doth onely conſiſt but in compaſſing of crownes; that will take more ſtate vppon him, then hee that is able to manage a princes Army in the field.
            Some others doe thinke, that the greateſt grace of gentility doth conſiſt in gawdy ſhowes, in fooliſh faſhions,

and to be like Protenus the God of ſhapes. Some their greateſt vertue is, to poure it in, and to put it out againe: ſome doe thinke to bee regiſtred in the Heraldes bookes, for wearing hayre of the new cut, one will haue it ſhort, another will haue it long, an other will haue his loue locke, or his lady locke, (or call it what you will) that ſhall hang dangling by his eare, an excellent place of Ambuſcado, to ſheltre Nits & Lice.
            There be ſome▪ that in their actions do affect honour, who in their ambition will proteſt of great wonders, and what they would bring to paſſe, if they had beene borne mighty, which ſort of men are commonly much talked of, but little cared for, when honour doth beſt ſhow her ſelfe in him, that doth rather ſeeke merite; then hunt after fame; yet I haue knowne of ſome of theſe aſpiring potentates, that were aſhamed to confeſſe their own parentage, but would challenge their alliance from ſome Lord, or from ſome knight, like the Mule that being demāded of his birth, being aſhamed to confeſſe that hee was the ſonne of an Aſſe; anſwered that he was coſen Germaine to a Horſe. In euery wel gouerned common wealth, men of learning, vertue & honeſty are aduanced and preferred, for dignity in an vnworthy perſon, is like a precious ſtone, that is ſet in baſe mettell, or like a ruſty rapier in a veluet ſcaberd: but opinion is a perilous fellow, and I thinke there is not a more coſening thing in the world, for it deceyueth Kings, Princes, Dukes, Earles, Lords, and what is he that is not ouer reached by opinion?
            It draweth moſt to great fortunes, and it is bred and foſtered by the breath of the vulgar.
            It preferreth men to dignities, to offices & places of

authority aſwell in the time of peace, as in the time of warre, for where opinion beareth ſway, ſhee rules like a God, ſhe makes fooles to bee reputed wiſe, cowards to be called couragious, and ſilly ignorant men to be admired for iudgement and skill.
            Opinion is a burre that ſtill cleaueth to the mighty, and it is more nice & fooliſh to pleaſe, then iudgemēt.
            Opinion is the mother of hypocriſie, it is blind, it is lame, it is ſelfe conceited, and it hath preuailed ſo farre that we want but another Eraſmus to deifie Opinion, as one hath already writ in the prayſe of Folly.
            Opinion is moſt ſmoothed by thoſe that doe affect and hunt after it themſelues, and that is commonly by men of the baſeſt condition, by ſuch as doe thirſt after promotion, as tale bearers, newes carriers, and ſuch other; and ſome too thinke to creepe into the very guts of Opinion, with drinking a health; ſome to winne Opinion, are excellent in diſcourſe at a table, they will talke of their owne actiuity, how many fraies they made in Fleetſtreet, what Ladies and Gentlewomen came to viſite them when they lay ſicke of the toothach, and they will ſometimes vaunt of a fauour from their miſtres, that were ſcorned by the maide: and bar them from this or other like talke, and they are as vtterly vnfurniſht as a chimnies end in a countrie houſe without a pudding, or a peece of bacon. I haue ſeene ſome of theſe fellowes that are of the ietting behauiour, that do thinke to reach at opinion by complements and quaint deuiſes, that will diſpute of intricate matters, that profeſſe to bee ſeene in all faculties, that will ſpeake by diſtinct ſpaces, and will refute all men by innouation of Method, that can ſometimes

ſpeake well, and alwayes liue ill.
            He that ſwaggereth and ſweareth, and ſpeaketh not a word, but it is full of terrour, that threatneth the ſtabbe or ſome other deadly blowe, that is able to diſmember a man with the verie breath of his diſpleaſure, that can ſhake him all to tatters, but vpon the point of his tongue, that is as fearefull to beholde, as the Gentleman that durſt not looke in a glaſſe when hee was angry, for affrighting himſelfe with the terror of his owne countenance, that ſcorneth to cut vppe the Gooſe-pie, that ſcorneth to drinke to him that will not pledge him a full cuppe, that ſcorneth ſometime to pay his debts; all this and more too, is, but to winne opinion, and ſo from thence to ſteppe to preferment.
            I neuer found leſſe performance in deedes, then in ſome of theſe prating fellowes, that are ſo ful of words; but for my part if I hit into their company, when I heare their tongues beginne to wagge, I liſten to their talke, as I liſten to a Bagge-pipe, that the lowder it ſqueyles, the more abiect I hold the muſicke.
            Now for this inſinuating baſenes that dooth woo preferment, as if ſhe were a wench to bee wonne with preſents, with prayſes, and with flattery; a faire worde, a ſmiling looke, or a flattering ſhow, were recompence good inough for thoſe creatures of ſeruitude.
            For mine owne part, I haue euer ſcornd to purchaſe reputation, or to ſeeke aduancement, by ducking, by crowching, by deiecting and proſtrating my ſelfe at mens feet, to ſubmit to a voluntary profeſſed ſeruitude, to daunce attendance, ſometimes three houres by the clocke, and then to bee bleſt with a Nod, commende it he that liſt, I cannot like it, neither do I loue to commit

the idolatry of out age, to make mortal men ſaints, to worſhip, to adore, to creepe, to crouch, & to make offerings: if any of theſe interpreting fellowes will ſay, I ſtand too much in my owne conceite, & therefore (perhaps) will not ſticke to breake a ieſt or two behind my backe, to get the ſtart of ſuch deprauers (& a litle to preuent them) I befoole him a fore hand, that doth thinke me ſo ſimple, as not to bee able to diſtinguiſh betweene ſeruile flattery and beſeeming curteſie; but to ſubmit my ſelfe to a baſe kinde of ſubmiſſion, to begge a litle preferment: let them winne that way thoſe that liſt, I hold the gaine to be more abiect and baſe, then Veſpaſians gaine gotten by vtine:
            But of all fortunes that might befall mee, it woulde anger me to the heart, to creepe into an office (yea, if it were into Knighthood it ſelfe▪) more for my wiues ſake, then for mine own worth.
            I will ſpeake no more of my ſelfe: but what indirect aſpiring is this, that to attaine to a little title of dignity, we ſhall make our ſelues to be laughing ſtocks, and to be holden contemptible in ſeeking a dignity, not being able to vphold the reputation of the place?
            It is a counterfeit faſhion to face the outſide with a litle ſatten, or ſome other like ſtuffe of a glorious ſhow, and to patch and peece the inſide with tatters & rags of litle worth: me thinkes there bee ſome, that if they did but examine and looke into their owne dignities, they ſhould bee very angry, becauſe they ſhould find them to looke with ſquint eyes, wrie mouthes, and flearing countenance, as though they derided & mocked at their maſters.
            This eye beguiling glory deceiueth none but fooles

and it is like the Gloweworme, that ſhineth a little in the darke, but in the light of the day, wee diſcerne it to bee but a paltry worme.
            I haue hitherto but ſpoke of Gentlemen, that do not know their owne places, nor many times how to martiall themſelues but with diſorder, iniuring and wronging others, and ſome of them with ſuch vnreaſonable preſumption as might turne to offence, and ſo to a quarrell; I hold it not vnneceſſary now (according to my promiſe) to ſay ſomething of Knightes, amongeſt whom (if there be not ſome miſtaking by the Heralds) there is ſome inequality and difference between them.
            The time hath been, when the Yeomandry of England did flouriſh, and were had in ſome account, but after the prouerbe began to grow in cuſtome. That euery lacke would be a Gentleman, our Yeomandry beganne to faint, and euen then to decay, and now our Gentlemē are as farre out of date, and this ſecond prouerbe approued to bee in full ſtrength and vertue, that is, Eyther a Knight or a knitter of Caps: for wee are now ſo full of Knights, that Gentlemen are had in little requeſt: the order of knighthood is auncient, & the dignity in ages paſt, hath beene accounted honorable, neither was it giuen but to ſuch as were able to countenance the place and had ability (both of wealth and wit) to gratifie their country, to benefite the common wealth, yea and to be aiders and aſſiſtants to princes in all their affaires, eyther in the time of peace, or in the time of warre.
            Such they haue beene, and ſome ſuch there be ſtil, but amongſt them there be as vnworthy, as the others are worthy, and here is the difference and inequality

betweene them.
            The one are knowne by their troupes of ſeruantes, that are attendant and waiting vpon them; the other are knowne by a poore Page or Lackey, or if they cā get a pild fellow or two in a thred bare Liuerie, it is a greater traine then ſome of their Fathers, or other of their predeceſſors before them were able to maintaine.
            The one are knowne by their hoſpitality and good houſe-keeping, aſwell in the City as in the Country, the other are knowne by their frequent to other mens tables, that are not able to giue a meales meate, nor ſcarſly to eate a good one (at their own coſts and charges) from one Sonday to another.
            The one are knowne by the authority and gouernment they beare in the common wealth, and are aduanced for their wiſedom, and renowned by their own deſert, the other are better knowne for their wiues vanity, then for their owne vertue, and not ſo much aduanced for their own wit, as for their wiues wantonnes. To be ſhort, the one are beloued of all for their wiſedome, and the other are ſcorned of al for their folly. I cannot tell whether it be an inconuenience to a common wealth, to haue ſo many vnworthy perſons puft vp into prid
                  •
               ; but this I anſwere, that a great number of the vnable ſort muſt vphold their pride, either by begging from the prince, or by ſhifting or ſcambling in the common wealth: for ſir Giles himſelfe muſt haue his ſatten ſuite, and my good Lady his wife, muſt needs haue her Coach, for to ſee a Lady to walke the ſtreetes without a Coatch, is like my Lord Maior, when he comes from Weſtminſter without a Pageant, or like

a Shroue Tueſday without a pancake.
            For as Knightes grow poore, ſo Ladies grow proude, and when a Lady is out of the new Faſhion ſhee is like a ſhippe that is out of Trim, ſhee will neuer ſteare well.
            The Romaines would neuer admit any man to carry the name eyther of knight or gentleman, that had not ſerued in the warres, neither would they dignifie any man with any of thoſe titles, but ſuch as had been famed for their ſeruice in the field, or otherwiſe commended for ſome excellent vertue: me thinks it were well if this were obſerued in the inſtitution of knights, and that as good reſpect might be had to their ability of welth, as to their ability of wit, and although I doe here yoke wealth with vertue, yet I do make wealth to be but the handmaid to vertue, for the exerciſe of liberality is many times as neceſſary for a knight as chiualry: but now we ſhall ſooner meet with ſir Dinnaden or ſir Dagonet at a dinner, then ſir Lancelot du Lake, or ſir Truſtrum de Liones in the field.
            Some doe hold, that amongſt Knights, he is to haue the firſt place, that had his firſt creation, and this is it that I haue laboured all this while to impugne: for what a diſparagement were this, that a man that were firſt by birth a Gentleman diſcended of worthy parents, trayned and foſtered vp from his very infancy in knowledge and vnderſtanding, that is of able reuenew to keepe hoſpitality, and to relieue the poorer ſort that are inhabiting about him, whoſe wiſedom and experience hath beene both tried and well approued, in his loue and ſeruice ſhowne, aſwell to his Prince as to his country, and ſuch a one being

worthily dignified to the order of knighthood, for his vertue and well deſeruing, another that is but baſe by birth, compaſſed (perhaps) with ſome meaſur of welth but not with an inch of wit; ſome of them not greatlie peſtered, neyther with wealth nor wit, his beſt complements, a litle pride and a great deale of ignorance) yet one of theſe little worthy creatures, creeping into a knighthood, whether by fauour, whether by fortune perhaps by fraud, but I am ſure, neither by merite nor by deſert, ſhould yet ſhoulder the other from the wal, becauſe he had his creation an howre or two before him.
            I could here find in my heart to chide (and that extreamely) but eſpecially in the behalfe of Ladies, I meane of thoſe Ladies that may bee ſaid to bee truely legitimate: for there bee of Ladies, as there bee of knightes, ſome in ſubſtance, and ſome in ſhow: but for thoſe that bee Ladies aſwell in nature as by name, I reuerence thoſe, nay I honor them, & although I know their vertuous inclination to be more ready to pardon, then willing to reuenge, yet what gentle ſpirite would not be grieued in their behalfes, to ſee a baſe borne Madam, whoſe mother would haue beene glad to haue beene a good Ladies Landres, and yet ſhe will pranke and pearch, yea and ſometimes contend with her for place and ſuperiority, that hath had her betters to attend her in her chamber. I did once know one of theſe femall kind, that the beſt bringing vp ſhe had whilſt ſhe dwelt with her owne mother (I thinke) was to ſtudy the Arte of Nauigation: ſhee had dayly frequent amongſt Saylers and Seafaring men▪ and in continuance of time ſhee fell to practiſe the Iacobs
               
               ſtaffe: and I durſt bee ſworne, ſhe neuer ſo much as dreamte of a Ladiſhip, but fortune (they ſay) is blinde and ſhe alwaies fauours fooles. The Prouerbe may be true, for we haue ſome knights in this age that are not accounted the wiſeſt men, and amongſt them ſhee was Ladyfied, and very ſhortly after that ſhe was numbred in this ſocietie to become a fellow Lady: ſhe began to ſcorne this excrement of wormes, this ſatten, ſilke and veluet were to meane for my Ladies wearing, vnles it were decked, garded and garniſhed with the minerall of golde, ſiluer and other ornaments of more pure and precious nature.
            
               Martial maketh mention of one of theſe baſe born brats called Poppeia, that after ſhee became a concubine to Nero, had her horſes ſhod with pure gold: I woulde be aſhamed of it, but I would match Poppeias pride with as baſe borne as her ſelfe, if I liſted to picke out preſidents, though not in ſhooing of horſes with gold▪ yet in other ſuperfluous vanities, no leſſe nice and fooliſh then that: but let them paſſe, and thus I will conclude, that as there is no ambition ſo violent, as that of the Beggers, ſo there is no pride to be compared to the pride of one of theſe abiect creatures, that is exalted & lifted vp from a baſe eſtate to a litle proſperity.
            But now to ſpeake of knights, I ſay that the dignitie was at the beginning giuen for ſeruice in the field, and was proper onely to martiall men, for there was the firſt inſtitution, but ſince it hath growne by cuſtome, that euery abſolute Prince hath power to beſtow that dignity aſwell in the time of peace, as in the time of warre, but yet knights are of the more or leſſe reputation, according to the quality of the Prince, or partie

that giueth the creation, for this is the opinion of the Heraldes, the Venetian eſtate, and the ſtate of Genoa, doe take vpon them to make Knights, and ſo doth the Pope; but with theſe wee will not meddle.
            In the time of the firſt inſtitution, the creation was performed with many ceremonies, and as many ceremonies again were vſed in the degradatiō of a knight. There are three or foure ſundry orders of knightes in England, but I will onely ſpeake of thoſe that haue neither garment badge, ſigne nor ſhow whereby to be knowne from other ordinary Gentlemen, but by the addition of ſir Iohn, ſir Thomas, ſir Richard, or ſir Robert, by which notes they are better known amongſt our ſelues then they are to ſtraungers, and theſe knightes are called by the Heraldes, knightes Batchelers.
            Theſe knights are made either by the king himſelfe or by his commiſſion and royall authority to his liuetenant, eſpecially in the time of warre, who hath his royal and abſolute power for the inſtant.
            This order is giuen vpon diuerſe conſiderations, whereof the principall is for ſeruice in the field, and to theſe eſpecially belongeth the greateſt honour, and ought to take the firſt place, for I haue knowne, (and I haue ſomtimes ſeen) both Earles & Barons, that haue receiued the order of knighthood in the field, & haue thought themſelues therby to be dignified: for as the beuty of euery common wealth conſiſteth in the vertue of their Nobility, ſo the wings of true Nobility, wherwith to make her to flie hie, are the deeds of chiualry, for being inlightened with martial skil, it maketh him to ſhine more cleare and bright.
            
               
In the time of Peace, the dignity of knighthood is beſtowed of many worthy Gentlemen, who for their wiſedome and ability euery way, are fit to ſway & gouerne in the common wealth, and theſe knightes are worthily honored, & are ſo to be reputed & regarded.
            After theſe in the thirde ranke, let them march in Gods name, whom the prince himſelfe doth aduance (perhaps) in hope of their future ſeruice, or for any other reſpect or conſideration (whatſoeuer) for it wel beſeemeth a king to make a knight (thogh it be but for his pleaſur) becauſe a prince may giue him maintenāce to hold his eſtate, as he gaue him Knighthood at his pleaſure, whither any ſubſtitute may doe the like, I will not diſpute, for if hee makes a Knight for his pleaſure that is vnable, eyther he makes a Begger, that muſt bee ſtill crauing of the Prince, or ſuch a burthen, that of neceſſity, muſt be a peſter to the common wealth, for thoſe knights that are but poore, bare and needy, are like cyphers that do make figures rich, but are themſelues worth nothing.
            I am ſorry now at laſt to ſpeake of thoſe that are a ſtayne to that honourable order of Knighthood, that knowing themſelues to be of no deſert, nor any waies able to merite, will buy the dignity and purchaſe their knighthood with money, a ſilly humour that loueth admiration, and procureth laughter.
            I haue known of theſe betrayers of vertue, that whē hee had made his purchaſe of a knighthood, the beſt that he was able after to performe, was to take a place at the vpper end of the Table, and all the vertue that was in him beſide, was this, hee loued to pay the Fidlers.
            
               
I might inlarge a great deale of other matter aboute this contending and ſtriuing for places, this ſtanding vpon precedence and ſuperiority, who is better, and who is worſe, but to him that is not partiall, it might very well appeare, that aſwell amongſt Noble men, as amongſt Knights and Gentlemen, the martiall man is firſt to bee preferred, yea amongſt Emperors, kinges and princes, hee is euer holden to bee moſt magnificent, that is moſt martiall: and this is not mine, but the opinion of the Heraldes.
            Now for a number of counterfeit Souldiers, that wil be called Captaines, ſome of them that neuer had charge, vnles (perhaps) at the fetching home of a Maypole, or ſometimes preferred more for fauour then for any ability that was in them, vnles to leade men to the ſlaughter.
            Some other againe that haue beene a littleat the ſea, a pilfering, that for the ſeruice, or what belongeth to the ſea, are more ſimple and ignorant then the poore ſhippe boy, and theſe bee they that are a ſlander and diſgrace to the Art Militari, for there is no greater inciuility, no baſer diſorder, nor more ſhamefull miſdeameanor, then is vſed by theſe counterfeit Souldiers that do march vnder the title of Captaines.
            But what profeſſion is free from counterfeites, when Diuinity it ſelfe is ſometimes made but a cloke for hipocrites: And here if I might but craue a litle licence, I might ſpeake of a kinde and manner of affinity, that is between the Deuine and the Souldier, ſympathizing and concurring ſo nearly together, that both their vertues and their vices might bee ſaide to bee a kinne, and to haue proceeding from one originall:

they are both warriours, the one with the word, the other with the ſword: the one fighting againſt the pride of ſinne, and againſt all enemies ghoſtly & ſpirituall: the other fighting againſt the ambition of Tirants and againſt all other oppreſſors, eyther forreine or domeſticall. A good Captaine muſt haue training, practiſe and experience, before hee take vppon him to conduct in the ſeruice of his Prince: a godly Deuine muſt haue learning, wiſedome and knowledge, before hee take vpon him the cure of ſoules in the church of God.
            The vnskilfull Captaine but leadeth men to the ſlaughter: the ignorant Deuine leadeth ſoules to deſtruction.
            A good Captaine, fearing the attempts, and ſodaine ſurpriſes of the enemy, is ſtill vigilant and watchfull: A good Deuine fearing the creeping in of vice, & the hote Alarmes of ſinne is euer ready to make reſiſtance.
            The Captaine that ſometimes buyeth his company and attaineth to his charge more by fauour of friends then by his owne vertue, is more ready to poul & pill his Souldiers, then to performe any ſeruice; the Deuine that creepeth into a Benefice by ſiniſter practiſe, more for the loue of the liuing, then for loue of the liuing God, will ſooner fleece his flocke then feede it and will bee more ready to contend with his pariſhioners for thoſe duties that are appertaining to himſelf, then to teach and inſtruct thē in thoſe duties that they owe vnto God. Thoſe Captaines that are too formal and in the preſcribing of martiall Diſcipline, are more nice then neceſſary, are the diſturbers of the loue and amity that ſhould be amongſt Souldiers, and doe many

times hinder the expedition of ſeruice that might be performed: thoſe Deuines that are more preciſe in the ceremonies of the Church then the worde it ſelfe doth warrant, are the ſeedes men of diſſention, and by their too much curioſity, they ſet abroach thoſe ſtrifes and contentions, that are lets and hindrances to many godly proceedings that might benefite the church.
            The careles Captain ſuffereth his Souldiers to ſpoile to rob, to ſteale, to bring in booties, aſwell from friendes as foes, hee cares not from whome, ſo he may haue his ſhare; the couetous Deuine ſuffereth his flock to wander in blindnes, to follow idolatrie, and to rob God of his glory, he cares not how, ſo it bringeth in beeues to his kitchen, horſe to his ſtable, and money to his cofers.
            I might be infinite in this compariſon, but let it reſt: and to conclude (I ſay) they are moſt deteſtable vices, that are moſt deſirous to looke like vertues.
            An Heretique of good life (ſaith Origen) is much more hurtfull, and hath more authority in his wordes, then he that doth diſcredit his doctrine with the lewdnes of his life, wee muſt therefore take heed of Papiſts that are of godly conuerſation to the ſhow.
            The holy Hipocrite is more to bee feared, then the Publican or Harlot, yet beware of a woman, that hath once marked her ſelfe with infamy, let her afterwardes pretend neuer ſo much honeſty. I dare not vndertake to write an Apology in defence of his wit, that in deſpight of gray hayres and wiſedome too, will intangle himſelfe with one of thoſe marked creatures; but ſhe may bring him children, and teach him to ſing with the ſummer bird, I might haue liued merily, if I had loued neuer.
            
            
               
But to conclude the Text that I haue taken in hand; we contend about precedence and ſuperiority, wee ſtriue who ſhall goe before, and who ſhall follow after, and wee do all make ſemblance to hunt after honour, but in truth we hunt contrary, and miſſing the right tract where honour is to bee found, wee content our ſelues with a little vaine glory; but it fitteth the time, and letit doe ſo ſtill, for there is no amendment, the world (I ſee) is growne to be like Frier Bacons braſen head: The time is paſt, and there is no hope of recouery.
            Chriſt ſweateth bloud, whilſt wee ſnort and ſleepe; Chriſt wraſtleth and ftriueth with the world, whilſt we ſtand by, and giue him the looking on; Chriſt hath humbled himſelfe to the Croſſe, wee diſpute of dignities, who ſhall ſit on the right hand, who on the left, who ſhall goe before, and who ſhall follow after: wee are lifted vp in our owne conceites, wee ſwell with pride and preſumption, the one of vs againſt the other, we miſſpend this treaſure of time, which God in his mercy hath giuen vnto vs, this bleſſed ſeaſon of peace, which by a gracious gouernement wee now enjoy, which ſhould bee conuerted to better vſe and purpoſe.
            In the time of peace, Philoſophie hath his peculiar exerciſe: and when wee are exempt from the trouble of warre, it is then time to ſettle religion, to eſtabliſh lawes, and execute iuſtice, to endeuour the knowledge of Artes, and Sciences, and in the time of peace, it is thē high time to prouide for warre.
            FINIS.
