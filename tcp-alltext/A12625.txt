            AN HVMBLE SVPPLICATION TO HER MAIESTIE.
            MOST MIGHTIE and most mercifull, most feared, and best beloued Princes, they are at the bottome of a helplesse miserie, whome both a condemned estate maketh common obiects of abuse, and an vnpittied oppression barreth from discouering their griefes to those, that onelie are able to afford them remedy. Euery one trampleth vpon theyr ruine, whom a Princes disgrace hath once ouerthrowne. Soueraigne fauours being the best foundations of Subiects fortunes, and theyr dislikes the steepest downe-falles to all vnhappinesse. Yet a Prince supplying the roome, and resembling the person of Almightie GOD, should be so indifferent an arbitrator in all causes, that neyther any greatnesse should

beare downe Iustice, nor any meanes be excluded from mercie; and therefore an humble confidence in your Maiestes goodnesse, (perfect in all Princely duties, & the only shot anker of our iust hopes) induced vs to lay open our manifold extremities, which heretofore (as it seemeth) hath bin scarcelie heard, lesse beleeued, and nothing regarded. And though our condition be so desolate, that wee can neyther be freed from outward miserie, but by becomming inwardly more miserable, nor complaine of our troubles, but our very complaints are punished: yet an infamed life, being to free mindes more irkesome then an innocent death, we had rather put our vttermost hazards to your highnes clemencie, thē seeme with our silence to giue credit to our obliques: to which if wee doe not, it may be imagined we cannot answere.
            There hath beene of late published to our vndeserued reproch, so straunge a proclamation, that it hath made your most affied Subiects doubtfull vvhat to beleeue: sith they see so apparent and vncurable truthes, countenanced with so Reuerende authoritie, & warranted with the most Sacred sight of theyr most honored Queene:

the due respect that euery one carrieth to your gratious person, acquiteth you in their knowledge, frō any meaning to haue falsehood masked vnder the veile of your Maiestie: yet when they see your Soueraigne stile so abased, to the authorizing of fictions, that the Magistrates of the vvhole realme, most generally sooth thinges so directly disproued by common scence, and contrarie to their own, and all mens knowledge, it cannot be but a torment to theyr Christian mindes: yea, and it must make them of force iustlie to scorne that anie Subiect should dare in so high a degree, to blemmish both his Princes, and her officers credits, as to draw them to auerre his plaine and inexcusable lesings: for what can they thinke, but this to be either a racking of publike authoritie to priuate pusposes, who being yet ripe to reueale their owne dangerous grounds, are forced to borrow these deluding shadowes, or an open condemnation of your Maiesties actions, as though they bare themselues vppon so vniust and lawles motiues as could not able them for righteous, but by begging releefe of these counterfet illusions.
            Wee verily presume that none of your

Maiesties Honorable Councell, would eyther shew so little accquaintance with the Princes stile, as to deliuer in your name a discourse so full farced with contumelious tearmes, as better suted a declamorous tongue, then your highnes penne, or be so lightly affected to the regard of your Honor, as to defile it with the touch of so many false assertions: yet all men iustly marueile that any Inditor durst aduenture to disgorge their priuate ill will, rather then to obserue decencie in so publike a thing: yea they lament their own case, when these abuses make vncertaine what to credit in serious points, importing their Countrie, & their owne safeties, when they see in this (which seemeth to be but a Prologue to future Tragedies) the strongest foundation to humane beleefe, applyed in all mens mindes to support meere improbabilites. And though the iniurie offered to your Maiestie, and meerely concerning your Realme, might in equitie challenge al mens pennes to warne you of so perilous courses: yet sith Priestes and Catholikes, are the markes chieflie shot at, wee aske humblie leaue of your Maiestie and Councell, to shew how chollericke the humor was towardes

vs, that cared not though the arrow hit your Highnes Honour in the way, so the head therof might enter into our harts. It is an easie thing to be a true Prophet, in foreseeing how this necessarie clearing will be aggrauated to your Maiestie with heinous words, sith those that would dislodge vs out of all good opinions, will doubtlesse endeuour to fulfil any such Prophecie: but now we humble our Petitions to your care of innocencie, that it may arme your eares against such partiall appeachers, and incline you to measure your censure with equitie.
            To make therefore our entrie vvith the vnfauorable tearmes, wherein we are often and generally called vnnaturall Subiectes, wee desire to haue it decided by your Maiesties owne arbitrement, whether we haue iustly deserued to weare so base a liuerie: if wee liue at home as Catholikes professing our name, and refusing to professe a contrarie Religion, we can neyther keepe our places in the Innes of Court, but wee are imprisoned for Recusancie, impouerished, troubled, & defamed. And yet if we leaue all and seeke free vse of our conscience, depart the Realme taking such helpes as the Charity of other countries affordeth vs, we

are strait rekoned for vnnaturall Subiects.
            It is rather an vnnaturall thing to disobey the author of nature for any creature, in forsaking the faith by which wee hope only to be saued, and yet we must doe this to the wilfull murdering of our soules: or if we refuse it, be we at home or abroad, by these hard censures we are proclaimed vnnatural. All bonds both of nature & grace inuite vs to loue God, and our Countrie more then our liues, and our neighbours as our selues: which if we obserue in the highest degree, we hope what other title soeuer we deserue, we shall at the least be deemed not to swarue from the rules of Natiue curtesie: we are in so mightie & warrantable proofes assured by all Antiquitie, that our Catholike Faith is the onely truth, (to which all that haue bin, or shall be saued, must owe their fidelitie) that we thinke it a worthy purchase, for the perseuerance in the same to forfet our best fortunes, & engage our liues to the great cruelties, thē by reuolting from it, to enter league with error, & to make our soules the price of infernal paine, if thē we esteeme it at a higher rate then our liues, beleeuing that out of it, neyther God can be truelie serued, nor any

soule saued: so if wee seeke with our deepest perrills to plant it in our Realme, and to winne soules from misbeleefe vnto it, we thinke that we owe a most sincere, and naturall loue to our Countrie: for euen by Christs owne testimonie, no mans Charitie reacheth to any higher point, then to yeeld his life for the benefit of his friend. And if others that so deepely touch vs for vnnatural creatures, would with as much diligence haue searched out the truth by an indifferent triall, betweene the learned on both sides, as they haue with violence martyred, and oppressed vs, they vvould happilie thinke themselues more vnnaturall, for hauing misledde infinite soules into endlesse perdition, then vs that with the sweat of our dearest blood, seeke to gleane a few scattered eares, the sillie reliques of their infortunate haruest. And if our due care of our Countrie be such, that to reare the least fallen soule amongst your Maiesties Subiects from a fatall lapse, we are contented to pay our liues for the ransome, how much better should wee thinke them bestowed, if so high a penny-worth as your GRACIOVS SELFE, or the whole Realme might be the gaynes of our dearest purchase.
            
               But though they that hunt this fault in vs, might best be their owne pray (faith being the strongest of true and naturall fidelitie: yet must we be accounted vnnaturall, being ballanced in their affections, that draw all causes of compassion to motiues of crueltie, and make theyr condemning reports, the contraries of our dutiful meanings with the like spirit, still breathing more ill will, then truth: He tearmeth the Right Honorable the Lord Cardinall Archbishop Allen, and Father Parsons (both learned & reuerent men) two seditious heads, looking happily through such eyes, as iudge all men by theyr owne colours, & what cause haue they giuen to this slaunderer, vnlesse it be coūted sedition to gather the ruins of Gods afflicted Church, and to haue prouided Sanctuaries, for persecuted & succourlesse soules: which forced at home, either to liue with a goared conscience, or to lie open to continuall vexations, rather choose to leaue theyr countrie then their Catholike Religion. It was no sedition for many in Queene Maries time, to be harboured in Geneua, maintained thē by those that now enuie against vs. It is no sedition to admit such multitudes of straungers, as for theyr

faith swarme into England, out of all countries. It is thought Charity to aid the Stats of Flaunders in the behalfe of Religion. It is extolled in your Maiestie as an Honorable fauour to protect the Portingall, and S. Horatio Palanisine: but if wee (whose case at home) in respect of our faith is more miserable then any Protestantes in any other Countries, haue chosen two venerable men to procure vs some refuge, from our domesticall scourges, where wee may follow our studies, and exercise Pietie, strait your Maiestie (though induced to practise the same curtesie to others) is informed against them as seditious heades. So true it is, the same thing is not it selfe in diuers persons, & yet as God almightie and the world is our witnesse, nothing in those Seminaries, is either intended, or practised, but the releefe and good education of such forsaken men, as from the storme of our English shoare, flie thether for a calme roade, that perfited in the course of learning & vertue, they may returne to offer theyr blood for the recouerie of soules: As for the basenes of theyr birthes, which among other like pointes▪ is interlaced vvith as impertinent, as scornefull a parenthesis, as a fitter noate for the

penners, than for your maiesties obseruatiō.
            I meane not to dwel long vpon it, for the thing neither importeth any offence to God, not crime against your Maiesty, nor greatly abaseth them, whom excellent vertue, the onely true measure of worthinesse hath ennobled. Yet this without disparagement to any may truely be auoided, that the Cardinalls grace, is of as good & ancient a house, & euery way as worshipfully allied as some of the highest Counselours were in their meaner fortunes, till your Maiesties fauors, and their rare abilities, made them steppes to clime into their present honours. And whether he might of likelihood haue carried as high a sail if the time had equally secunded him with fauorable gales, I leaue to their iudgementes who are priuy to his present estate, greater than England can afford to any cleargy man. For your Maiesty being as able to know, & we lesse willing to vse the excellēcy of your subiects, thā other Princes, it may be iustly presumed, that he might as well haue entred into credite at home, if his Faith had not drawen his foote from the first step, as with strangers in a forraine country, wher nether familiarity with the Peers, nor acquaintāce with the Prince but the only fame of his worthines, sent an admiration & loue of him into thir harts, & whosoeuer considereth the manner of his

aduancement, being created Cardinal alone, out of the ordinary times, (a prerogatiue seldom yeelded but to special persons, who marketh his wisdome to haue bin in such reuerence, that in Pope Greg. the 14. his sickenes, he was thought fitest among the Cardinals, to be vizgerent in spiritual causes: who is ignorāt of the smal cause of our country, by laws, libels, & other meanes, seeeking to vndermine the Popes Sea (hath giuen him to reward her subiects, with so high promotions: who finally weyeth the aduentures of our Councel, to hinder his preferment, and darken his vertues with hard information, shal easly beleeue the mā to be of rare perfectiōs, that hauing no other wings to beare his credite, but learning and vertue, could reach to so high points of fauour, notwithstāding so mighty lets. As for Father Parsons he hauing placed the vttermost of his ambition, in cōtempt of honor, & the highest of his wealth in voluntary pouerty: will easlie acknowledge his birth to haue bin of more honest thē great parents: yet were they not so meane, but that they were able to afford him such education, as might haue made his good parts a way to no small prefermēt. And albeit his credit be great with the K. of Spaine, yet did hee neuer Vsurpe the Title of the KINGES CONFESSOVR, as

as this inditor would perswade your Maiestie, though some of the simple sort of our English souldiers, in the Gallies, vpon error and ignorance, muttered some such speeches amongst them selues. As for other Priestes how many of them are Knights & Esquires sonnes, as otherwise both to worshipfull and noble houses alleyed, & heires to faire reuenewes, let their owne friendes and Parents dispersed through the whole Realme beare witnesse. This onely vvee may say in answere of our obiected basenes, that in the small number of the Catholike Priestes of our Nation, (vvhich reacheth not to the tenth of the Protestant Ministrie) there are very neare as many, yea happily more Gentlemen, then in all the other Cleargie of the whole Realme.
            Now whereas we are most vncourteouslie called a multitude of disolute youngmen, wee desire no other euidence to disproue this accusation, then an indifferent censure: For first before our departure out of the Realme, we must resolue to abandon our Countrie friendes, and all such comforts, as naturally all men seeke and finde in theyr natiue Countrie. Wee must relinquish all possibilities of fauour, riches, and

credit. We must limite our mindes to the restrained and seuere course of the SOCIETY OF IESVS, or the Seminaries, where the place is in exile, the rules strickt, the gouernement austere, our willes broken, the least fault chastised, & a most absolute vertue exacted. And who can imagine those to be so desolute humors, who this determine to abridge themselues of all actions, of disolutenes, and to imprison their affections within the presinct of a reguler and straight order, and lest happily it may be imagined that wee say more then in proofe we finde, it is knowne to thousandes, and daylie seene, and witnessed by trauellers, that we are there tide to so prezise tearmes in diet, apparell, exercise, & all other things, that wee are much more shortned of our scope, then in any Colledge of our English Vniuersities. I omit the prayer, fasting, haire-cloth, and other chastisements of the body, vvhich being voluntary, yet vsuall; are to any if not more then partiall Iudges, inuincible groundes against this slaunder, of being dissolute: but let our intertainmēt at our returne, be a finall ouerthrow of this false imposition: for who can thinke them dissolute, that being by the Lawes, by examples

by commō experience taught, with what bloody conflictes they are heere to encounter, & howe many feares, daingers, and agonies, both in life; and death, they vndoubtedly expect, (are notwithstanding contented) for reclaiming of soules vnto Gods folde, willing to yeelde their bodies to the hasard of al those miseries foreseene, and foreknowne, and aduisedly chosen before all worldly contentments.
            But it may be that some, vnaquainted with our states, will measure our mindes, by our apparell, (beeing as we confesse) more agreeable oftentimes, to the common fashion, than to the graue attire that seemeth our calling, neither is our habit, or behauiour so ruffian-like, or disordered, (as this inditor, euer forgetting trueth, when he remembreth vs, would willingly haue it imagined) but in this we must yeeld our reason, (sith we cannot reforme the inconuenience) till your Maiesty thinke it good to licence vs without daunger, to exercise our functions, much-more mighty is the saluation of our soules, than the externall decency of our apparell, which though it be necessary in time and place, yet is it not so essentiall a point, as for the care

thereof, to neglect the charge of Gods flocke, & the safetie of our owne liues: Dauid vpon iust cause fained him mad, but his madnes was an effect of perfect wisedome, and reason the guide of his seeming follie. Iudith laying aside her hairecloth, and widdowes weed, disguised her selfe in such ornaments, as were fitter to allure laciuious eies, thē to beare witnes of her sober mind. And if God added grace & beautie to her youthful dresses, to further her iust reuenge vpō her enimies, much more may we hope he will allow a lesse disguisage in vs, to reuiue the soules of our dearest friends. It is no sure argument of inward beautie, to be vaine in shew, seeing a modest and an humble minde, may be shadowed vnder the glorious & courtly robes of a vertuous Hester. And if angels for the benefit of bodyes haue suted their shapes, to the requestes of their Ministers: now appearing like souldiers, as to Iosua: now like trauailers, as to Tobie: now like gratious youths, as to Lot: yea if Christ as the occasion required, seemed to the two Disciples a Pilgrime, & to Saint Marie Magdalene a Gardiner, why may not we for the winning of soules, (which as God is our witnes is the onely cause of our

comming) frame our behauiour and attyre, to the necessity of our daies, as we read the auncient bishops did, in the persecution of the Vandalls, this therfore cānot be estemed a iust presumption of a dissolute minde in vs, whom not any will to such finenesse, but a desire of safety enforceth vs to weare the liueries of the time.
            Nowe whereas the heauy aduersaries of our good names, hath abused your Maiesties eares with a truethlesse surmise, that we shoulde auoide the Realme for lacke of liuing, we humbly resigne his folly, to the correction of your Highnesse wisedome, for to whom can it seeme probable, that we flie for lacke of liuing, of whom many haue vowed all, willingly acepted a voluntary pouerty, leauing that we had, without either hope, or care of getting more, our wealth beeing nowe in well-doing, and our passions, our best possessions, is it like that for wante of liuing any woulde enter into a course, wherin without possibility of preferment they were in apparant hazarde to loose their liues: are anie sledde for such pouerty, that at the least they coulde not haue liued in seruice, with more ease and lesse labour, than they tie themselues vnto,

in a most streight life, where they doe more by a willing obedience than they should haue beene put vnto in a hired subiection, or are they of such qualitie, and of so manie pleasing partes, that they can in these seuere times winne men with perill of their Liues, Landes, and Posterities, to entertaine and comforte them, and could they not haue found without plunging themselues in the Sea of daungers, some more easie meanes for a competent maintenance, then to beg it out of so manie exegents, and to wring it through so grieuous oppressions, and why should these feares of wantes pinch them more then infinite others, whom they left behind them? They are men of as pregnant wittes, as deliuered tongues, as mature iudgements, as most of the Innes of Court, or Vniuersities where they liued: yea, they were already stepped so far into promotion, that they needed not to haue doubted, nothing lesse then lacke of liuing, diuers of them hauing bin Proctors of Vniuersity, Fellowes & Officers of Colledges, and likely to

kinred, vvith rich & most wealthy families. It pleaseth further this vnfriendly informer (who seemeth best pleased with displeasing vs) to deriue our departure from a conscience guilty, of crimes committed, being stil himselfe in the likenesse of his speeches, as voide of veritie, as full of ill will: for if Priestes at theyr arraignement, be in manner charged with Originall sinne, many of them hauing bin scarcely borne, at the rising in the North, which is alwaies a common place to declaime against them. If all the notorious faults, that may any way cō
               cerne Catholikes, are made ordinarie inditements, to condemne those that neuer heard of them, till they come to the barre: how much would any fault of their own be obiected, yea and multiplied in the vrging, if any such could haue bin found: but yet none was euer touched for any thing committed before his departure, as all testimonies may depose, and the verie recordes testifie in our behalfe, and to preuent any inst groundes of this oblique, the superiours (not ignorant how many eyes are busied in watching for the least aduantage against vs) make diligent scrutenie, for the perfect notice of theyr vertue, whome they admit

to Priesthood, who being for the most part among many of theyr owne houses, or standing in the Vniuersities, could not cloake any great enormitie from notice: yea the very age of the greater part (they going euer very young) is a warrant to quite them from any such offence, as should force them to flie their Countrie. And as for the rest, which are of riper yeares, they haue bin so notified for theyr morrall life, that they haue made common report theyr harbinger, to take vp their due roomes, in euerie mans good opinion. In sume this being an approued accusation, deliuered by one that in the same discourse, hath empanalled an enquest of vntruths, to finde out him in this also guilty of falsehood, it needeth no other answere, but a wise censure of the Reader: But now most mercifull Princesse licence our too much wronged innocencie, to relate the sharpest doubt of this vnkinde aduersarie, ioyned vvith those three odious tearmes of fugitiues, rebels, and traytours, & dipped as deep in the bitternes of gaule, as hee would haue it enter into our dearest blood: And first wee craue most humblie but the right of Christians beleefe of our oath, which is the only Certificat to make

our thoughtes vndoubted; vppon hope whereof we oppose our guiltlesse hartes against these tiles, as our best armour of proofe, protesting vpon our soules and saluation, and calling Almightie God and his Angels to witnesse, that as we hope to haue any benefit by the most precious woundes, and death of our Lord IESVS CHRIST: the whole and onely intent of our comming into this Realme, is no other; but to labour for the saluation of soules, and in peaceable and quiet sort, to confirme them in the ancient Catholike faith, in the which theyr forefathers liued & died, these thousand foure hundred yeares, out of which we vndoubtedly beleeue it is impossible that any soule should be saued.
            This from the sincerest of our thoughts, before the throne of God, wee must truelie professe, intending if no other remedie may be had, to let your Maiestie seale it vvith the best blood that our faithfull, & faultles harts can afford. And if any be so hardened in a set incredulitie, as rather to condemne vs to periurie, thē to cleare vs vpon so deep an oath, we will make reason his guide into our intentions, by which if he think vs not as much perished in our wittes, as he supposeth

vs to be in our fidelitie, he shall easilie see the truth of our protestation: for first, treason being an offence that carrieth with it selfe a staine of infamie, as can neuer be taken out, and maketh them that commit it dead, & vnpardonable persons. Who cā imagine any so foolish, desperate, as to incurre so reprochfull a crime full of certaine perils hauing no other possible marke for his hope, but the vttermost of worldlie euils. And if any one should chaunce to be so farre distracted from his sence, and to throw himselfe into so bottomles a destruction: Yet that so many, and so learned, & so graue men, as dayly suffer for their cōming in Priestes, would cast away their labours, liues and credittes, for nothing but a cruell and eternall reproch; our bitterest enimie would neuer deeme it likelie, and what other inticement shuld allure vs to be traitors, not any perswation that our selues can compasse so great an exploit, (there being scarce 300. Catholik priests of our nation in the whole world; a sillie armie to subdue so great a Monarchie) not any confidence in Catholik assistance, whō none is so mad to think able to doe such an enterprise, being few in nūber, dispuruied of munitō, narowly

watched by Officers, restrained in their liberties, impouirished in their goods, & disabled in all prouisions. Not the imagination to be aduaunced by forraine power: for then we would rather expect the conquest, till the time and oppertunitie were ripe, for vs to enter vpon our hopes, then so venterously to presse vpon the swordes of our enimies, and hazard not only our future expectations, but our present safeties, wee would rather liue abroad, though it vvere with as hard shifts, as those that now possesse honorable romes did once at Ceneua: then leopard our welfare, to so many so knowne and vneuitable harmes, which we are more likely soone to feele, then so long to eschue. And if wee were to come as rebels into the Realme, our education in Colledges should be aunswerable to the qualities, we should be trained in martiall exercises, busied in publike and ciuell affaires, hardened to the field, & made to the weapō: whereas 1000. eares and eyes are witnesses, that our studies are nothing els but Philosophie & diuinity, our teachers religious men, acquainted with no other knowledge but learning and vertue, all our warlike preparations, the wresting for our wils, the mortifying of our

bodies, and a continuall warfare with Nature, to get the victorie ouer our selues: and for other schoolepoints of sedition, wherein this our hard friend findeth vs to be instructed, Almighty God is our witnes, that wee neyther learne nor teach any, hauing only had in our studies, the common end that all men shot at, namely to attaine such knowledge, that might be an ornament to our functions, a help to our conuersations, & a benefit to our countrie. But if by these Schoolepoints of sedition be meant that religion which there we are taught: and here wee professe this meaning aunswereth it selfe: For this cannot be any way treasonable to your Maiesties estate, vnles that it be esteemed offensiue, which was the faith of all your royal auncestors, these 1400 yeres, is the faith of the greatest part of Christendome, and for the defence whereof your Maiesties most worthy father, attained the glorious title of defender of the Faith. But vvhatsoeuer this informer meant by his schoolepoints of seditiō, we hope that your Highnes censure, wil free vs from the thing it selfe, sith neyther likelihood to effectuate any hope at home, nor any likenesse of our education abroad, can in your vvisedome

seeme to argue vs guiltie of anie rebellious intentions. Let this further be an assured proofe to the contrary, that sith we are so religiously addicted to the end of our comming, that for the atchiuing thereof, we recount our torments, triumphes, & our deathes a glorie: If this end were the ouerthrow of your Maiestie: or if your displeasing had bin the point, that with so many bleeding woundes, wee haue witnessed to be so deare vnto vs, wee would with the losse of fewer liues, haue perfitted our purposes, and long ere this haue brought the cards to an vnfortunate shufling: for whosoeuer hath content̄ed his own life, is Maister of anothers: and he that is resolute to spend his blood, will rather seeke to sell it for the intended price, then with a fruitles affection cast it away for nothing.
            No no, most Gratious SOVERAIGNE, Heauen and Earth shall vvitnesse vvith vs in the dreadfull day of doome, that our breastes neuer harboured such horrible treasons, and that the end of our comming is the saluation of soules, not the murthering of bodies, wee beeing rather willing to die, then to contribute the least haire of our head to the latter, and not so willing

to liue, as to shed the best blood in our bodies: for the first, giue then (O most gratious Queene) wise men leaue to see, that they shew themselues no lesse disloyall to your Maiestie, thē enuious to vs: that durst diuulge these Fables vnder the name of your Highnes, making their Prince the patronesse of theyr fayned, and deuised falsehood.
            Now with what shadow or likelie-hood, can it sincke into any sound beleefe? that we come with ample authority, to perswade your Maiesties Subiects to renounce theyr duties, and to bind them with othes & Sacraments, to forsweare their naturall allegence to their Princess highnes, & to yeeld all their powers to the Spanish Princes forces: for to say we doe it vppon hope, to be inriched with those possessions that others now enjoy, hath but smal semblance of probabilities, considering how much likelier wee are to inherite your RACKES, and possesse your place of EXECVTION, then to suruiue the present incombences of spirituall liuinges, or to liue to see any dignities at the KING of SPAINE his disposition, and sith both the daylie Martyrdomes of manie before our eyes, and

our own euident and hourely daungers, can not but kill in vs all such aspiring fantasies, if any minde were so m

               , as to sell his soule at so base a rate.
            Let it be scanned with equitie, how little seeming of truth it carrieth, that so manie should vpon so improbable and vncertaine expectations, offer their liues to most probable and certaine shipwracks. And can any imagine vs to be so simple, that we cannot see how impossible it is for Catholikes to do the king any good, though they were as much bent that vvay as their accusers would haue it thought: doe we not see that they are scattered one among thousandes, and at all such accurrants so well watched, and so ill prouided: that to vvish them to stirre in the Kinges behalfe, were to traine them to their vndoing, & to expose them to a generall massacer by domesticall furie, and what better aduocate can plead for vs in this case, then your Maiesties own experience, who in the last attempt of the king, found none more forward to doe all duties, and liberally to stretch theyr abilities, then Catholikes were in your highnes defence, and though they were ceassed for men and money, farre aboue their reuennewes,

and so fleeced of theyr armour and weapons, that they were left vnfurnished, for their owne sauegards: yet were they so far from mutining, or touch of disloyaltie, that they willingly yeelded more, then any other of their qualitie, vvhich doubtlesse if Priests had sworne them with othes, or bound them with Sacraments, to the contrarie they would neuer haue done: sith they venture both liues and liberties, for other charitable works of farre lesse weight, then the auoyding of the damnable sinnes, of periurie and sacriledge. It is also vvell knowne euen vnto the Coyners of these vntrue surmises, that if the King should come so slenderly prouided, as to need the handfull of Catholikes helps, (who neyther haue conntenance, charge, nor authoritie in the common wealth) your Maiestie neede not greatly feare, sith it were impossible he should be strong, to whome so weake, and bootles a succour should be necessarie. And to what effect should wee then perswade Catholikes to leaue theyr obedience to your Highnes, sith it can neyther benefit vs, nor auaile them: but rather draw vpon vs, both a manifest subuersion: yea did we not rather strengthen them in their duties,

and so confirme them in patience, that with conscience and religious feare they restrained nature. It were imposible for fleshe & blood to disgest the vnmercifull vsage that they suffer by such persons, whose basenes dubleth the iniury of their abuse: for who, if it were not more than the feare of man that hath helde them, would not rather die vpon the enimies that sought their blood, (as for men of ill mind it were no hard matter) than to liue to continuall death, & to leaue the authors of their euills behinde them, to triumph ouer their ruines, and to send after them more of their deerest friendes. What gentleman coulde indure the peremtory & insolent imperiousnes of a company of gredy & manerlesse mates, which stil are praying vpon Catholickes, as if they were common booties, & ransack them day & night, brauing them vnder their own roofes, with such surlinesse, as if euery cast-away were allowed to be vnto thē an absolute Prince. But happily because we desire to recouer the lapsed, & confirme the standing in the ancient faith of their forefathers, it may be presumed that this is a with-drawing from your Maiesties obedience. But if indifferēcy may be one of the Iury, disloialty shal

neuer be found the sequell of any article of our Religion, which more than any other, tyeth vs to a most exact submission to your Temporall authority, and to all pointes of alleageance, that either now in Catholicks Countries, or euer before in Catholickes times were acknowledged to be due to any Christian Prince: doe not nowe Catholicks gouerned by the Princip
                  •
               les of their faith, yeelde in respecte thereof with a knowen mildnesse, their goods, liberties, landes, & liues, and doe they not with a most resolute patience obay a scourging, and afflicting hande.
            Then howe much more woulde they bee willing to double their duties and increase their seruiceable affections to your Highnesse, if they sounde but the like clemencie that other subiectes enioye, and were not made (as nowe they are) common steeles for euerie mercilesse and flint-harted, to strike out vpon them the sparkes of their fury.
            It is a point of the Catholike faith, (defē
               ded by vs against Sectaries of these daies) like subiects are bounde in conscience vnder paine of forfeting their right, in Heauen, and in incurring the guilte of eternall

torments, to obay the iust Lawes of their Princes, which both the Protestantes and Puritanes deny, with their father and master Caluin. And therefore if we were not pressed to that, which by the generall verdit of allegeance, was iudged breach of the Lawe of God: we shoulde neuer giue your Maiesty the least cause of displeasure, for (excepting these points) which if vnpartial audience were allowed, we coulde proue to imploy the endlesse misery & damnation of our soules, in all other ciuill and temporall respectes, we are so submitted and pliable, as any of your Maiesties best beloued subiectes. If then your highnesse woulde vouchsafe to behold our case, with an 
                  〈◊〉
                eie, and not to viewe vs in the mirror of a misse-informed minde, we woulde not doubte, but that your excellent wisedome woulde finde more groundes euen in pollicy, and in the due care of your safetie, to incline your gratious fauour towards vs, stil inthralled in our present vnhappinesse. But it may be, that some more willing to rip vp olde faults, than to admit any clearing of them, when in their hearts they haue already condemned vs to all punishments, will heere bring in Ballards, and Babingtons,
               
matters against vs, as a Golias to ouerthrowe all other proofes of our good meanings. To this first we aunswere, that it were a harde course to reproue all Prophets for one Saule, all Protestantes for one Wyat, all Priestes and Catholickes for one Ballard and Babington.
            
            Your Maiesties sister reigned not the sixt part of your time, & yet sundrie rebellions were attempted by the Protestant faction against her, in that short space, as euerie Chronicle can witnes: whereas in this your Maiesties prosperouse raigne of 35. yeares in all England, the Catholikes neuer rose but once in open field to haue wonne the freedome of conscience, which the Protestants in those few yeares laboured vvith so many mutinies: for as for Parrie, hee neuer professed in like, nor action to be a Catholike: yea, and he tooke it offenciuely vvith signification of his minde, in hoat wordes, that some vpon surmise, had so named him, and therefore howsoeuer hee might by aspiring thoughts, or mercinarie mutinies, be by any forraine enimie vsed to euill practises, it cannot iustly be layed against vs, whō neyther priuitie nor consent to his intentions, can any way touch: and as for the action of Babington, that was rather a snare to

intrap them, then any deuise of their owne, sith it was both plotted, furthered, and finished, by S. Frauncis Walsingham, & his other complices, who laied & hatched al the particulers thereof, as they thought it would best fall out to the discredit of Catholiks, & cutting of the Queene of Scots: for first it is to be known to all, that Poolie being Sir F. Walsinghams man, and throughly seasoned to his Maisters tooth, was the chiefe instrument to contriue and prosecute the matter, to draw into the net such greene wittes, as (fearing the generall oppression, and partly angled with golden hookes) might easilie be ouer wrought by M Secr. subtile & sisting wit: for Poolie masking his secret intentions vnder the face of Religion, and abusing with irreligious Hypocrisie all Rites & Sacraments, to borrow the false opinion of a Catholike, still feeding the poore gentlemen with his masters baits, and he holding the line in his hand, suffered them like silly fishes to play themselues vppon the hooke, till they were throughly fastned, that then he might strike at his own pleasure, and be sure to drawe thē to a certaine destruction. And though none were so deepe in the very bottome of that conspiracy as Poolie himselfe,

yet was hee not so much as indited of any crime, but after a little large imprisonment (more for pollicy thē for any punishment) set at liberty, & in more credit then euer he was before: for it being a set match, & he hauing so well performed his euil part (though to please Babes.) A stroke was giuē to beat him, yet doubtlesse he was largely fed in priuie pay, as so Christian pollicy did best deserue. It is also known by Phillips the deciphers letters to his party practisioner, G. Gifford, in whose chest and chamber they were taken at Parris, & by G. Giffords owne examination, that these Gentlemen were bought and sold, being drawen blindfolde, to be workers of their ouerthrow, and carrie with silly Isaac the fire, in which they thē selues were to be sacrificed. And sure it is, that all the letters that fed them with forraine hopes, all the deuises that wrought them into home-bred imaginations, sprung all out of the Fountaine of Sir FRAVNCIS WALSINGHAMS fine head: for GILBERT GIFFORD hauing some yeares before beene Maister Secretaries intelligencer, (as the date of Phillippes Letter vnto him discouered) when the matter was once on foote in England, was made the meane

to followe it in Fraunce among certaine of the Scottish Queenes friendes, more apt to enter, then able to go through great dissignements, where he knowing of the letters, and the course how they were conueyed, discouered all to M. Secretarie, to whō also he brought diuers of the like tennor, written partly to the Queene, partly to Babington, at his owne comming into England: wheras more thē 3. months before, the coū
               cell would seeme to know these intentions: and when by often resort to Sir Frauncis Walsinghams house, in priuate sort hee had taken of him priuie directions, to make his course the more plausible for his proceedings in Fraunce, he practised here with the French Embassadours Mounsieur Catanense, whom then he knew to be verie well affected both to the Scottish Queene, & to the Duke of Guyes, & though he were a man of more then ordinarie discourse: yet with so forsworne an hipocrisie, and so deep periuries, did Gifford ouer reach him, that when the traine was discouered, some of the Gentlemen inraged with so great impietie, said that though it were a great part of the Gospel that an English man would be true, they should hardly beleeue it, for that Diuell

               Giffordes sake, as in their passion they tearmed him: But so it was that Gilberts wit farre too good for so bad an owner, & newly refined by M. Secretaries forge, wonne so much credit, that he being commended and beleeued, as his desire was, he went ouer to intreate by meanes with the Duke of Guyse, and such others as were thought fit to be taken in, as stales to countenance the matter, and to put the Gentlemen in vaine expectations, till the thred vvere spunne to the intended length. And so far was this vnfortunate wretch giuen ouer to desperate malice, that first to possesse him more of M. Secretaries good opinion, and to shew his aptnesse to be vsed in such exploits, he dedicated to him, a booke of hys owne compiling, breathing such Infamies, and Atheismes, as best became the spirit of so periured and Apostata: and on the other side, to shun the suspition of being M. Secretaries bad instrument in this vnchristian pollicie, he was himselfe confessed, purposely Graduated, and as it is thought made Priest: so impious were the meanes to wrest the poore Gentlemen from their duties, to theyr confusion. Phillips also, who was M. Secretaries right hand, held correspondent

with Gilbert Gifford, stil keeping the ice from breaking, till they were all vpon it, whome they meant to drowne in the same destruction. And to draw the Queene of Scottes into the better opinion of this designemēt, vvhome experience had taught to suspect so daungerous motions. The matter vvas with continuall and secret meetinges verie seriouslie vrged with her agents in Fraunce, in whome it is feared they relyed too much affiance: but vvhether for loue to theyr Maister, they were apt to entertaine anie hope of her deliuerie, or for league vvith M. Secretary, too ready to build vpon his foundations, they induced the Queene to like of their good will, that were willing to aduenture their states and liues to doe her seruice, and as things were by these inuentions, ripening in Fraunce: so Poolie no lesse diligently plied the matter at home, continually conuersing with Ballard, & the gentlemen, & laboring to draw more conies in to the hey. It is strange to marke with what cunning the graue and wiser sort of Catholikes, were sounded a far off, not by reuealing any direct intention: but so nicely glā
               cing at generall pointes, with iffes & andes, that they neuer vnderstood the language,

till effects did consture these roauing speaches: yet when so much of their disposition was known, by their vnwillingnes to heare, & peremtorines in cutting off the Officers of such discourses, there was no lesse care vsed to conceale these purposes from them, then there had bin cūning to serch out how they would deeme of thē: for it was feared, their wisedome would haue found out the fraud, & vntimely haue launced an vnripe impostume. It is further knowen that the coppie of that letter which Babbington sent to the Queene of Scots, was brought ready penned by Poolie, from M. Secretary: the answere whereof, was the principal grounds of the Queenes condemnation. There was also found in Sir Frauncis Walsinghams accountes after his decease, a note of 7000. pounds bestowed vpon Nato & Curlie, who being the Queenes Secretaries, framed such an answere as might best serue for a bloody time, & fit his intentiō that rewarded them with so liberall a fee. This made Phillippes so bold to aduise Gifford by his Letters, that if he came in any suspition of detecting the Queene, he should lay it eyther to Nato, or Curlie, whose shoulders being bolstred with so large bagges, he thought vvould be best

able to beare the burden away: It is also certaine that Barnard (
                  •
                M. Secretaries vndoubted agent) went ouer into Fraunce about this practise, there free passages being warranted with all securitie: when they had beene there so long, that Barnard might looke into these proceedings, that in those Countries were actors in the matter, he returned againe with Ballard, and hauing a large Commission from Sir Frauncis Walsingham, to take what manner of horses hee would, out of anie Gentlemans Parke, or Pasture, and of other vnusuall liberties, he went with Ballard into the North, there he sought with what sleights he could, to haue wonne diuers Gentlemen, making Ballards credit his countenance, and drawing the poore men vnwittingly to be the occasion of his own and others ruine. In the end hauing cusoned another to get a Letter of commendations to the Lord Prior of Scotland: he sifted out of him what he could, & taking vvith him a Letter touching this matter, hee brought it vvith all the intelligence and successe of his malicious Pilgrimage, to the Councell. And though hee were thus inward and conuersant with Ballard, carrying him to sundrie Gentlemen of

account, to feele & tempt them about this action, and to drawe them into the desired compasse: yea though himselfe were a motion to some, to enter into it, pretending that he had ouer reached M. Secretarie, in getting that Commission: yet was hee neuer called to the barre, but hired to stay a time in restraint, with such a recompence for his seruice, as might be well perceaued to be large, by his liberal spending, & plenty in prison, hee being otherwise a hungrie and needy marchant, without eyther trade or liuing to maintaine such expences: and how priuie S. Frau. was to the whole course of the Gentlemens actions, and to the certaine period of the time, wherein all his indeuours would come to the full point, may be gethered by this, that being by a Priest that was to be banished sued vnto for 20. dayes respite to dispatch his busines: first repeating the number, and pausing a while with him selfe. No saith he, you shall haue but 14. for if I should grant you any more, it would be to your hinderance, as you shal heare hereafter: wherein he said true, for much about that time, was publike notice taken of Babbingtons matter, all waies vvere watched, infinite houses searched, hewes &

cries raised, frights bruted in the peoples eares, and all mens eies filled with a smoke, as though the whole Realme had beene on fire, whereas in trueth, that was but the hissing of a fewe greene twigs, of their own building, which they might without any such vprore haue quenched with a handful of water, but that made not so much for their purpose as this buggish terible shows: and thought they were so well acquainted with all the Gentlemens hearts, that they might euery houre in the daye or night, haue drawen them in the nette like a couie of partridges. Yet forsooth, must some of them be suffred purposely to flee that they might haue the better colour to make those generall demonstrations of a needles feare. Iohn Sauage likewise when he came to the Courte, was so wel knowen to be a chicken of that feather, that two Pentioners were charged to haue an eie vnto him, and to watche so long as he stayed there, and yet was he suffered to goe vp and downe, and vsually to haunt the presence, till all irons were hotte that were laide in the fire, to feare the credite of poore Catholickes, and to giue the Queene of Scottes her deathes wounde: it was also noted, that after Ballard
               
was inchaunted with Poolies charmes, he became a stainger to all Iesuites and other Priestes, beeing limited by the politicke rules of his promptor, to such company as Master Secretary knewe to be of diuine sights, to see through so many mistes, as he by his instrumentes had alreadie cast before their eies, the Gentelmen were also throughlye charmed, to keepe their councells from the wiser and mature sort of Catholickes, whome there was no hope to make them parties. Of which Iohn Charnocke at the barre saide the reason to be because the older, the colder, yet the true grounde was a speciall promise of Master Secretary to keepe the threede out of their handes that woulde soone haue vnwounde it to the bottome, for what man that had but knowne the first sillable of pollicye, woulde thinke it a likelye course for them, to alter the whole state of so great a kingdome to quite contrarye Religion and gouernmente, that neither hadde power to backe them, (as then there was none readie, nor helpes at home to support them) being al but priuate gentelmen, (neither of wealth, nor sufficient credit for such a matter) to carry with them any great numbers,

who would not haue pittied their indiscretion, that intending so great an alteration, thought it a fit way to goe pickeing here & there one, as if such plots in so many young tongues could lie hidden so long, as to giue them respite to gleane a sufficient army. And for men that pleadged their heades in so daungerous attempts, to be so credulous, as to rest their hopes vpon so fliting & faire promises of forraine helps, without the certainty of such preparation of shippes & mē, as might come in due time to followe their beginnings, was a most childishe sight. And therefore for any man of experience that had looked to it, there would haue offered it selfe a iust suspition, that the plotte was rather a traine to entrappe the actors in it, than a meane to effect that intended by it. For though they had cut off some of the Councell: yea, and dismantled the realme of your sacred maiesty, (which Gods goodnesse neither woulde, nor we hope wil permit) yet had their purpose beene farre from any semblance of their desired issue, for then they must haue proclaimed either the Queene of Scotts, or at least by some means haue sought her deliuery, & consequentlie haue notified to the worlde that for her rising

was your Maiesties going downe. And what a tide of resistance would this notice haue done, none can be so seely but he must needs see. For first by the oath of associatiō, al the Nobility had bin bound, to persist hir to death, which many without an oth would otherwise haue beene apte enough to doe. The crowne also beeing lefte without anie declared owner, a faire goale for them that runne first at it, no doubte but diuerse competitors woulde haue hindered her course, to haue made her hopes-way to so faire an aime. Then the act of PARLIAMENT excluding straingers from the Crowne, (as she by diuerse meanes was diuoulged to be) woulde also haue added dainger to her claime, especially considering the auncient & deepe rooted dislike, betweene the Scottishe and the Englishe, no small motiue to a popular mutiny: but most of all her vehemency in the Catholicke religion, (against which both the Nobility, Cleargy, & commons were most violently bent) woulde haue made them ready in that respecte, to take heed of the least of these lettes, to exclude her from the Crowne, and to translate the title to some other more suteable, to their beleefe. All which impedimentes

meeting so full with euery eie, that did but loke towards them, must needs haue made any in reason to conclude it an impossibility for these gentlemen to haue compassed their drifte, which also they might easily haue discerned, had they not bin bewitched with master secretaties fine deuises, & deluded with his spies, cosoning letters and messages from forraine partes, for the Spanishe fleete was not ready in two yeers after, and in Fraunce, (more than a fewe that in Gascoine were imploied against the Hugonits) there was no kinde of prouision by sea, nor lande, yea the king was then knowen to be so sure a friend to England, and so sharpe an enimy to the Guisian partie, in which the Queenes affiance was only fastined, that he woulde neuer haue suffered her hopes to haue had 
                  〈◊〉
                by any French assistants. And from Scotland they neuer looked for any aide, knowing that if they were not euery way blinde, howe the king was wholly carried a way with an English byas, and so setled in the possession of the Crowne, and in the bent of the contrary faith, that what soeuer he might haue attempted for himselfe, it was neuer likely he woulde haue followed their designement, of which the

principall scope was the alteration of Religion. And he that in respecte of his beleefe, refused with the Infant of Spaine, the present possessiō of the Lowe-Countries assistance for the chalenging of his other titles, and promised to be proclamed heire, if the Spanishe king should faile, was doubtlesse much better armed against their slender perswations which could neuer haue tempted him with such glorious offers. Finally the weaknesse of their beginning was an apparant proofe that it was conceaued and bred by them that woulde be sure to bring it to an abortion, and neuer suffer it to preuaile to any other purpose, but to make vs more hatefull, and to bereaue your Maiesty of your more infamed than faulty Cosen.
            Thus much Gratious Soueraigne, is your Highnes drawen by these indirect courses, to vse your vnwilling sword, against your lesse fauoured, then faithfull Subiects, and put in vngrounded feares of theyr disloyaltie, who are of themselues so farre from defiling theyr hartes with any treasonable thoughts, that theyr heauie enimies had no other wayes to dismount them from theyr best deseruing, buy by violenting them too euill; by these sinester inuentions wee

know your Maiesties minde to be, from yeelding your Royall assent to so vglie shifts, you euer binding your desires to the limits of vertue, and measuring your Regalitie, more by will to saue, then by power to kill. Yet it cannot but afflict vs, to see your Highnes eares so gaurded against our complaints, and possessed with theyr perswations, that most maligne vs, that we can haue no other orators for your gratious fauours, then the tongues that cannot afford vs any fauourable word. It hath bin alwaies the pollicie of our aduersaries, to keepe vs aloofe from reuealing our vniust oppressions, lest they should incline your mercie to pitty vs, and they so arme your Highnesse with so hard informations against vs, that they make our very sute for lenity seeme an offensiue motion: yet sith wee must eyther speake or dye, seeing so many slightes are put in vre to burie vs quicke in all miseries, we hope God will make our petitions weigh into your hart, and winne your clemency to consider our distresse. Notwithstanding the slaunders that are published against vs: and if we may make our benefit of that which others haue vsed to our greatest harmes, we thinke that very act of

               Babington, may insure your Highnesse of the impossibility of Catholickes to bee drawen to rebellion, for when our oppressions were heauiest, our deathes ordinary, and so fine wittes busied to drawe vs into the foyle, yet was there not in all England in so long time founde out aboue one Priest, and he one of the meanest, and fewe more than a dozen Lay-men, that coulde be wonne to stoope to these odious lures. Let not therefore this more preiudice vs than so open threats, and direct menacings of the whole state, haue endamaged others, sith of our side, there followed no effecte, & our numbers were lesse likely to hurt (not ariuing to a scoare) than these that dared your Maiesties Scepter with many thousands, but because we like God-Almighties fooles, (as some scornefully call vs) lay our shoulders vnder euery loade, and are contented to make patience the onely salue for all sores: many that see, are willing to vse the awe of conscience, for the warrant to treade vs downe, whereas they presume not to meddle with others, although more fatall to your Highnesse estate, knowing that if they shoulde make them partners, but of halfe our afflictions, they woulde seeme to bewray

more impatient stomackes, for if the working of their spirites bee so vehement, as with so little feare and so much solemnity to proclaime a newe Christ and king of the earth, adding the creast of an vsurped Messias to countenance, the chalenge of humane soueraignty. If being so freely permitted to vse their consciences to themselues, and to enioie their honours, offices, and fauours in the common wealth, without any taste of your scourges, they notwithstanding sparkle not such tokens of a concealed flame, it can not choose but bee seene and knowne, howe much more cause there is, to loke into their actions, and to feare their attempts, than to wreake so much anger vpon vs, that were neuer chargeable with so huge enormities. And yet the death of one man shut vp in a silent obliuion, that open offer of vprore, & most blasphemous impietie against God and your Maiestie, though it be generallie knowne that there were more fauorers and 
                  〈◊〉
                of that parti than coulde be euer charged with Babingtons offence.
            We speake not this to incense your Maiestie against others, being so well acquainted with the smarte of our owne punishementes,

to wishe any Christian to be pertaker of our paines. Our onely intent is, most humbly to intreat, that if so impatient a zeale, accompanied with seditious wordes and actions, was so easilie finished and remitted in the chastisement of one, your Highnesse in clemencye, woulde not suffer so many innocent Priests & Catholikes, to be so cruelly and continually martyred, who neuer incurred so enormous crimes. And sith we daylie in our liues, & alwaies at our executions vnfeinedly praie for your Maiesty, sith at our deathes wee alwaies protest vpon our souls our clearnes from treason, & our dutiful & loyal minds, subscribing our protestation, with our dearest blood. Let vs not most mercifull Soueraine be thus daily plunged deeper into newe disgraces, and still proclaimed and murthered for traitours. Let vs not be so esteemed for Godlesse and desperate monsters, as to spende our last breath in bootlesse periuries, or at our greatest neede of Gods fauour, to sacrifice to the diuell our finall vowes, what reason then can moue vs so damnably to dissemble, when our expired date cutteth off all hopes, our deathe the ende of euills, hath in this worlde no

after feares, and a resolute contempt of our own liues, excludeth al thoughts of meaner liues, yea if any hope, feare, or loue carry any swaye, (as doubtlesse there doth in all Christian minds) it is a hope to be saued, a feare to be damned, aloue to God, to his trueth, & our endlesse wel-doing, al which in that dreadfull moment, (whereupon dependeth our whole eternity) can neuer be motiues vnto vs, to sende our forsworne soules headlong to hell-fire. But let vs proceede in our necessary defence, as the inditor doth in his false accusations, (we are charged for the easiar 
                  〈◊〉
                of vnnaturall people, weake of vnderstanding to yeeld to our perswations) to haue brought Bulles, & Indulgences pretending to promise Heauen, or cursing damnation to hel. It was but a forraine supply for want of true factes, to fasten vpon this fonde conclusion being so farre from trueth, and so full of incongruity, that euery nouice in our faith, can reproue it for error. I omitte the reprochfull termes of vnnaturall and weake vnderstanding, most iniuriously fathered vppon such a Princes pen, whome a Royall minde hath taught, not to staine her paper, or blemishe her stile, with those and

so many other base and reuiling wordes, as are pestered together in this proclamation. I reporte all men to their eies, and eares for aunswere to these slaunders, whether (the soule-rightes excepted) in all temporall duties, Catholikes be not as naturall to their Prince, as beneficial to their neighbours, as reguler in themselues, as any other subiectes, yeelding the vttermost of all that is exacted in Subsidies, Persons, Men, and Munition, besides the patient losse of our Goods and Landes for their Recusansie.
            Let it be read in letters of experience, whether Catholikes be of shallowe braine, or of so weake vnderstanding, that they woulde be carried away with these imaginary Bulles, promising heauen, and threatning hell, of which Catholikes eares neuer hearde before.
            This worlde can witnesse, that in Diuinitie, Lawe, and Phisicke, and all other faculties and functions, either of Piety, or pollicy, all Englande, I may say all Christendome, scarce knoweth any men more renoumed than our ENGLISHE Catholikes, (without vanity be it spoken in a iust defence) but though they were not such

               Sallomons for wisedome, as some others take themselues to bee, yet they bee allowed ordinary sence and intendment, which if it be but so much, as may serue them to tell ouer the Articles of their Creede, it is enough to be knowen that no Bulle can promise Heauen, or threaten Hell, but for keeping or breaking Gods Commaundementes.
            Iudge then, (most Soueraigne LADIE) whether that it be not too great an indignation to see the sacred name of our Noble QVEENE, which next to Gods worde shoulde be honoured among the most impregnable testimonies of trueth, to be with vndeserued abuse by any subiecte subscribed to these most vaine, and so impossible fictions.
            Who likewise (but meaning to make his PRINCES paine a spring of vntruethes) woulde against the certaine knowledge of so many and so infinite people, as well seers as hearers, euen as from your MAIESTY: that no PRIEST in Indited, Arreined, or Executed for Religion: sith it is so often, and in euerie Sessions seene, that vnlesse we our selues shoulde confesse manifestly that wee were PRIESTES, no other

treasonable crime, coulde bee iustly proued against vs, and for this (howe farre it is from deseruing this odious title) your Maiesty may easilye gather, for that all Christendome hath these fifteene hundred yeeres honoured for Pastours and gouernours of their soules, those that nowe are more than vnfauourably termed Traytors, yea if to be a Priest made by the authoritie of the See of Rome, & present within your highnesse dominions, be a iust title of treason. If they that harbour, reliue, or receiue any such, be worthy to bee deemed fellons: then all the glorious Saintes of this Lande whose Doctrine and vertue God Almightie confirmed with many miracles, were no better than traitours, and their a-bettours fellons. Then DAMIANVS and FVGATIVS, that first brought Christianity in King LVCIVS his time, 1400. yeers past: then Saint AVGVSTINE & his companions that conuerted our Realme in Saint GREGORIES time were, who in the compasse of treason, sith theyr functions and ours were all one equally deuided from the Sea of Rome, from whence they were directly by the Popes Elutherius and Gregorie sent into this kingdome being

Priests, and Religious men, as all antiquity doth witnes, yea all the Churches and places of pietie, (chiefe ornaments of this Noble Realme) all the Charters and Indowments bestowed vpon Priests & Religious persons, & yet registred in the ancient laws are but monuments of felonie, & fauourers of treason. And if it should please God to alot the day of generall resurrection in your Maiesties time, (a thing not impossible as vncertaine) what would so many Millions of Prelates, Pastours, and Religious people thinke, that both honored and blessed this kingdome with the holines of their life, and excellencie of their learning: much vvould they rest amazed, to see their Relikes burned, their memories defaced, and all theyr Monasteries dedicated once to pietie, praier, and chastitie: now either buried in their ruines, or prophaned by vnfitting vses: but more would they muse to find their Priesthood reckoned for treason, and the releefe of Priests condemned for felonie; these being the two principall testimonies of deuotion, that theyr ages were acquainted with: yea, what would your Maiesties Predicessors, and Fathers, with the Peeres & people of your Realme thinke, when they should

see themselues in tearmes of felonie by the censure of your lawes, for erecting Bishoprikes, and endowing Churches, founding Colledges, and some other like places, for the honoring and maintaining of Priests, & Religious men: yea and for giuing theyr Ghostly Father in way of releefe, but a cup of cold water, though it were at the verie point of death when they needed spirituall comfort, being to abandon their mortall bodies: and though the Priests at that time were not made since the first yeare of your Maiesties raigne, which is the onely point which excludeth them from the statute, yet were they all such Priestes, or Abbetors of them, as were consecrated by authority deriued from the Sea of Rome, (as al registers doe record) and present within your Maiesties realme, which are the only materiall points, for which we haue bin, or can be cō
               demned: for the Sea of Rome remayning in the selfe-same state, still indued with the same authoritie, and neither the manner of our creation, or Priest-hood it selfe, is any thing altered from that it was. Why should it be more treasonable to be made Priestes, in the midsomer day of your first yeare, thē the next day before, or the last of Queene

               Maries Reigne, for neyther doth the Pope, nor any other Bishop by making vs Priests claime or get any more authority in our Realme, then they of Basill or Geneua, by making Protestants Ministers, nor wee by receauing our orders frō him, acknowledge in him a mite worthy of authoritie, more then euery lay-mā doth through all Christendome: & as for othes & promises in receauing Holy Orders, we neyther take nor plight any but one common to the Priests of all Nations, vvhich is a solemne vow of perpetuall Chastitie, a thing rather pleasing then offensiue to a vertuous Queene, who hath for her selfe made choise of a single life. And who then can finde any cullourable pretence to verifie this slaunder more grieuous to vs then death it selfe, that wee are not condemned and executed for Religion, but for treason: we being alwaies arraigned & cast vpon this statute of comming into England, being since the first of your Maiesties Raigne, made Priests by the authority of the Sea of Rome: for what can be meant by Religion, if it be not a point, yea and a chiefe point thereof to receaue a Sacrament of the CATHOLIKE CHVRCH (as wee acknowledge Priesthood

to be) of the chiefe PASTOVR and PRELATE thereof, from vvhence vvee can proue all lawfull Priest-hood to haue descended this fifteene hundred yeares, & to auouch vs Traitors for comming into England, or remayning here is an iniurie without ground, sith in this respect, the statute could not touch vs (setting priesthood aside) many comming and going at theyr pleasure, without such supposall of treason: But it is our comming in as Priests, that is so highly condemned, & therefore our Priesthood and nothing els punished by this law: And howbeit the chiefe deuisers of this, & all the like decrees (euer seeking to attayne their drifts, against religion vnder some other pretence) exempted the QVEENE MARIE Priestes, from the compasse of this Statute, by a limitation of time: yet vvas that but a colour to inueagle such eies, as either through carelesnesse woulde not loke, or through weakenesse could not reach to their finall intentions, and little regarded that a few old & feble men, whom neither age, by course of nature, or they by any other acts might sone cut off, so the seed might be extinguished & a new supply of posterity preuented, which by this Lawe

(though in vaine) they purposed to doe. Be it therfore neuer so much mistitled with the vndeserued name of treasō, the

                reproch cannot couer the truth frō your Maiesties best deseruing insight, which by this cannot but apparantly see, that it is, it vvas, and euer will be religion, for which wee expose our blood to the hazard of these laws, & for the benefit of souls, yeeld our bodies to all extremities. It may be also easily gathered by the weakest wits, what huge treasons they be, for which we be condemned, sith at all our araignements and deaths, we are offred, that once going to church, shuld wipe away the heinousnes of this treason: a curtesie neuer mētioned to true traitors, & a sufficient proofe it was a religious faulte, that is so easily clered by a religious action: yet we must with iust complaint of most vniust proceeding acknowledge, that at the bar many things, (whereof not so much as our thoughts were euer guiltie) are besides our Priesthood, partly by inditement, partly by some in office laid to our charge, and yet so naked of proofs, or of any likely coniectures, that we can neuer be condemned of any thing, but our owne confession of Priest-hood: and hereof the last araignement

of three Priestes at Westminster, euen since the Proclamatiō, gaue such an ample notice, as the Lord chiefe Iustice said; that though many thinges had bin vrged, yet was hee to pronounce sentence of death against them, only vpon the statute of comming into England, being made Priests after the Romaine order, since the first of her Maiesties raigne: yet it hath bin some time obiected against Priestes, that they should pretend to kil your sacred Maiesty: a thing so contrary to their calling, so far from their thoughts, so wide of all pollicy, that whosoeuer will afford reason her right, cannot with reason thinke them so foolish to wish, muchlesse to worke such a thing, euery way odious, no way beneficiall. Wee come to shed our owne blood, and not to seeke the effusion of others blood. The weapons of our warrefare are Spirituall not offensiue, and vvee carrie our desires, so high lifted aboue sauage and brutish purposes, that we rather hope to make our owne Martyrdome, steppes to a glorious eternitie, then our deathes, our purchase of eternall dishonour. And who but men vnwilling to haue vs thought owners of our right wittes, vvould abuse your Maiesties authoritie,

to sooth vpp so great vnlikelie-hoodes, sith none can be so ignorant, how pernicious it vvere for PRIESTES & CATHOLIKS, to loose the protection of your Maiesties Highnesse, and to forgoe present suerties, for vncertaine chaunges. For if any would bequeath his blood to so brutish a fact: if hee were not as much enimy to all men, as to him-selfe, hee vvould at the least haue some apparance of benefite, that might be supposed to ensewe to those, for whose good, hee vvould be thought to haue cast away his life: but none that looketh but a steppe before him, into future accidentes, can thinke it any vvaie auaileable vnto vs, to be bereaued of your Maiestie: sith that our hopes are now bent, not vppon anie

Nowe whereas he imposeth on some to haue saide, that they woulde take part with the Armie of the Pope, against our Realme, it is a most vnlikely thing, vnlesse it were proceeded out of some fraile toung by force of torture, that was rather willing to say what they seemed to require, than to abide the hel of their intolerable torments, for such is nowe our forlorne estate, that we

are not onely prisoners, at euery promoters pleasure, and common steps for euerie one to tread vpon: but mē so neglected by our Superiours, and so left to the rage of pittiles persons, that contrary to the course of all Christian lawes, wee are by extreamest tormēts forced to

                our very thoughts. It is not enough to confesse that wee are Priests: (for it is seldome denyed) but wee must be vrged vpon the torture with other odious interogations, farre from our knowledge, much further from our action. We are compelled to accuse those whome our conscience assureth to be innocent, and to cause their ouerthrow by our confessions, to whose souls we

                Pastors, and they the fosterers of our bodies. And if we doe not, because without vntruthes and iniuries we cannot answere, we are so vnmercifuly tormented, that our deathes, (though as full of pangs as hanging, drawing, and vnbowelling vs quicke can make them) are vnto vs rather remedies, thē further reuenges, more releasing then incresing our miseries. Some are hanged by the handes eight or nine houres, yea twelue houres together, till not only their wits, but euen their senses fayle them, & when the soule (weary of so painefull

an harbour, is ready to depart, then apply the cruell comforts & reuiue vs, only to martyr vs with more deaths, for est soones they hang vs in the same maner, trying our eares with such questions, which either we cannot, because we knowe not, or without damning of our soules we may not

Some haue beene tortured in those partes, that it is almost a torture to Christian eares to heare it, let it then bee iudged, what it was to Chaste and Modest men to indure it, the shame beeing no lesse offensiue to their minde, than the paine, though most excessiue to their bodies; diuerse haue beene throwne into vnsauorie

and darke dungeons, and brought so neere staruing, that some for famine haue licked the verye moisture of the walles. Some haue beene so farre consumed, that they were hardly recouered of life. What vnsufferable agonies we haue beene put vnto vpon the Racke, it is not possible to expresse, the feeling so farre exceedeth all speech. Some with instruments haue beene rouled vp together like a balle, and so crushed that the blood sprouted out at diuerse partes of their bodies.
            To omitte diuerse other cruelties, better knowne by their particular names, to the Racke-Miasters, and Executioners, then to vs, though too wel acquainted with the experience of their smartes. It is not possible to keepe any reckoning of the ordinary punishments of BRIDEWELL, nowe made the common Purgatorye of PRIESTES and CATHOLIKES, as grinding in the Mille, beeing beaten like slaues, and other outragious vsages: for to these we are most cruelly enforced at the discreation of such, as beeing to all other despised, vnderlings, take their onely felicitie in laying their greedye commaundements, & shewing their authority vpon vs,

to whome euery warder, Iaylor, and Porter, is an vnresisted Lord.
            Thus (most excellēt Princes) are we vsed, yea thus are we vnhumanely abused, for being Priestes, & of our forefathers faith, and of purpose to wring out of vs some odious speeches, which might serue at our arraignments for stales to the people, to make them imagine greater matters than can be proued: whereas neither euill meaning, nor trueth, but torture onely was guide to the toung that spake them, within so hard conflictes of fleshe & bloode, with so bitter conuulsions, is apte to vtter anie thing to abridge the sharpenesse and seuerity of the paine. Such vndoubtedly were the wordes alleaged of taking part with the armie of the Popes, against our Realme, if they euer issued out of Priestes mouthes, or else they were spoken by some vnskilfull Lay-man, that knowing not howe to aunswere such captious questions, and for reuerence of the chiefe Pastour of GODS Church, not daring to say that he woulde not take part against him, had rather venture his life, by saying too much, than hazard his conscience in not aunswering sufficient. But the ignorance of one must not

measure the meanings of all, whom knowledge of our deathes teaches aunswers far different from his, and maketh vs ready to defend our Realme, as the Catholike subiectes, of you Maiesties auncestours, or any other Princes were, or euer shall bee. For did we carry so traiterous mindes as our enimies giue out, we coulde not possible bee so cowardly or foolish, as to suffer these tyrannies for nothing, beeing otherwise resolued to dye, and knowing the heads and handes from whence these cruelties proceede, without your Maiesties priuities. But as with patience and mildenesse we hitherto haue, and hereafter meane to indure our scourges, hauing no way deserued thē, but by seeking the saluation of soules, and praying for their good that torment vs, so in aunswere of this point, do we assure your Maiesty, that what armie soeuer shoulde come against you, we will rather yeeld our breastes to bee broached by our enimies swordes, than vse our swordes to the effusion of our Country blood. But let vs now come to the confusion of some that woulde auouch Cardinall Allen to be Pope, and Father Parsons to the king of Spaine, to haue shewed certaine scroles of the names of catholikes,

and to haue tempted him to renue the war, by promising many thousands that shoulde be in England ready to aide them, concerning which there needeth no more to be said, but that the penitents that made the confession, knew wel enough that they were not with their right ghostly father, or else they woulde neuer haue committed such a sacriledge, abusing the Sacramentes with such vntrueths. For we are assured by their notice, who were more internal & cō
               uersant with them both, than the authors of this confession euer coulde be, that they are sufficiently enformed of the estates of Catholikes, the one by experience, the other by continuall reports of those that goe ouer. And therefore neither in pollicy, in which they are noe punies, nor honesty on which their creeit doth lye, would they deliuer such follies into Princes eares, which all protestantes hearing by so many atturneies, (as all protestants doe) were able to disproue them of falsehood, for neither are the restraints, and number of Catholikes so secret, nor the course to suppresse them so vnknown, but euery Prince seeth it an impossibility for them to doe any thing, being as before is shewed, so naked and needy, &

euery way so vnprouided. Neither woulde they in discreation, (if they were as they are not) the motioners of the Kings comming, feede them with a vaine hope of thē, whom they at least knewe to be a kinde of broken reeds, sith the more helpe he expecteth,, the lesse he would bring, & happilie builde a maimed plotte vppon a false supposall, to his second ouerthrowe: and if this preparation be greater than euer, why shuld he thē trust to our lesse ability, & the Laws daily weakening our strength, & time hourely encreaseth his more than he did at the first assault, whē not any Priest nor Catholike in Englande, was acquainted with his cōming, nor sure of his intent, til the cōmon voice bruted it, & our prouisions ascertained his purposes, & vnlesse they were our enimies they would not in cōmon wisdome shewe scrolles of our names, or promise our assistance, sith they knewe not howe ready our aduersaries at home would be vpō lesse matters to seeke our subuersion, yea though they shuld as we are sure they wil not (passe so fond promises) yet could not Catholikes but hazarde all their estates in their vncertaineties of forraine war, seeing specially his last ouerthrow, & knowing the enterprise to

be such, that eyther the King must stand vpon the strength of his owne force, or the sorrie addition of theyr impotent succour, which can neuer inable him to contriue his endeuours. Finally, both Cardinal Allen, and Father Parsons, are knowne generally to be men of excellent gifts, and no such nouices in the knowledge of Princes intelligencers, as in the weighty pointes of alteration of States, & inuasion of Kingdomes, to presume to delude them with impudent assertions, knowen to themselues to be false, as the informer acknowledgeth this to bee. And if effects, the most infallible testimonies of intentions, may beare the deserued credit against naked & vnprouided words of this partiall Inditor, Father Parsons hath by euident demonstrations of a loyal mind, sufficiently cleared himselfe from such vndue suspitions: for hauing by his wisedome & rare parts, purchased more then ordinary credit with the King of Spaine. All that haue bin eye witnesses of his proceedinges, can auouch, that he hath vsed the kings fauour euery way to the benefit, but no vvay to the preiudice of your Maiesties subiects. The souldiers that in your seruice lost their liberties, and expected no other entertainment,

but the customarie pay of professed hostility, was by his meanes an intercession, not only pardoned their liues, but with new apparrell & monie in theyr purses, enfranchised to their full liberties, eyther to stay in the Countrie, if they so fancied, or to returne to their owne, if they were so better pleased; yea whereas by long continued breaches, betweene Spaine and England, the name of an English-man was in most parts of those kingdomes, farre lesse loued then knowne: he hath vsed such meanes for the mittigation of theyr enmity towardes vs, that now wee are no lesse welcome amongst them, and more charitably vsed, then in most other Nations: whereof not only the quiet of Marchaunts, the admittance of our Studentes, euen in the hart of our Realme, (both things vnusual in so iealous and suspitious times) but the singuler curtesie towards theyr professed & known enymies, who are actually taken in a violent enterprise against them, gaue proofe to your Maiestie, witnessing how much Father Parsons hath quallified the dislikes, that wars bringeth forth: for euen the Athalantado or cheefe Gouernour of the Galleyes of spaine, to make manifest that neither the

king, nor his Nobles had in the heate of their Martiall broyles, lost the feeling of theyr auncient League with our Countrie, sent into the Gallies of our English Captaines, the plate and meate from their owne table, that the world by these friendlinesse know, how much better they can vse theyr enimies, then some of your Maiesties vnworthy Maiestrates, your naturall subiects, and loyall friendes. And though it rest not in a priuate mans power, to stay the endeuours of so mightie a Prince, in so generall, and important an enterprise, as is war with England. Yet this vvithout presumption may be truely said, that if euer hee should preuaile in that designement, (as the casualties of warre are most vncertaine, and only ouer ruled by God) Father PARSONS assisted vvith Cardinall ALLENS authoritie, hath done that in our Countries behalfe, for which his most bitter enimies, & generally all your Maiesties Subiects, shall haue cause to thanke him for his seruiceable endeuours; so farre hath hee inclined furie to clemencie, and rage to compassion.

entertaine any rumors against the credit of Catholiks, hoping of likelihood to sell them these fables for some benefite of more importance.
            No no most GRATIOVS Soueraigne, it is not the authoritie of two priuate men, that can carrie away Princes, so readie to imploy the manie forces, if they haue not motiues of greater consequence: and whosoeuer considereth our surprising of the Kinges Townes in Flaunders, or inuading his Countries in Spaine, and Portingale, our assisting his enimies against his daughters right in Brittaine, our continnall intercepting his treasure, warring with his fleets, and annoying▪ his Indies: shall finde other causes of his comming, euen since his last repulse, then the slender hope of a fewe beggerlie Catholickes, or the fainte perswation of two banished men. It is also no small iniurie that is offered to your Highnesse, in making your SACRED hand, guided by such thoughts as scorne to haue vntruthes the patrone of your actions, to seeme the Authour of this Sentence: That manye men of wealth professing in your realme a contrary religiō, are knowne not to be empeached for the same, either in

their liues, landes, goods, or liberties, but only by paying a pecuniary summe, as a penalty for the time, that ther refuse to come to Churches. If this be as truely, as confidentlye spoken, why were the venerable Prelates, and other Priestes, and Gentlemen depriued of their Liuings, and pyned in Wisbiche: why are all the principall Catholikes committed to Elye, knowne to the ministers, then to Banbury, afterwardes to their owne houses with a short compasse about them, beeing nowe only let loose to verifie a part of this proclamation, and to be easlyer ensnared in the perills thereof, to which euery child may see, they are more subiecte at home, than they woulde be in prison, and if they chance not to be so wary not to be entrapped, effectes will soone proue, (if your Maiesties fauor preuent not the intention of others, that this libertie was) for a purpose, iust at the comming forth of the proclamation graunted, sith order will soone be taken, that they shall not surfet of being so long free, and if this saying be true, that none are troubled for religiō, what keepeth at this houre at London, Yorke, and other places, great numbers of manie poore Catholikes in prison,

some of them languishing a-way with the commodities of their inclosure, haue by a patient death obtained the best liberty, others yet after many yeeres indurance, for no other cause but for Religion, beeing offered liberty if they would goe to Church. Pining still in painefull restraint, witnesseth to the worlde, with their lingring miseries, the manifest falsenes of this assertion Was it not punishment for Religion, when a cō
               panie of Honorable & Worshipful Ladies and Gentlewomen were most vnciuilly led through Cheapside, with their Priests before them, only for hearing MASSE, and that before Priesthood was enacted to be Treason. Is not that very statute a most heauy oppression, now when the most of these Queene MARIES Fathers that are left, are become so oulde and impotent, that they can not possibly supply Catholiks speciall necessities, to make it by Law fellony to receiue young Priests. Are not Catholiks shortned by this means frō such helps to which their conscience and Religion bindeth them, a torment to vertuous minds, more afflictiue than any outward punishment? Are they not by this tied to this wounding and bitter choise, either to

liue like Heathens vvithout the Rites of Christian and necessarie SACRAMENTS, for theyr soules health, or to purchase them at the rigorous price of hazarding theyr Liberties, Liues, Landes, and Posterities, as in case of fellonie. In points also of our credit, hovv deepely vvee are incurred in respecte of our Religion, hovv many experiences make it most manifest? Wee are made the common Theame of euery rayling declaymer, abused vvithout meanes or hope of remedie, by euerie wretch with most infamous names: no tongue so forsworne, but it is of credit against vs: none so true, but it is thought false in our defence; our slaunders are common workes for idle presses, and our credits are daylie sould at the Stationers staules, euerie Libeller repayring his vvantes, vvith impayring our honours, being sure that vvhen all other matters faile, any Pamphlets against vs shall euer be vvelcomed, vvith seene, as allowed.

If vvee subscribe to Articles, it must be called Hipocrisie: if vve refuse disloyaltie, in some wee are measured by the eyes and tongues, of such vvhome wee can no vvaie please, but by being miserable: yea, the verie name of a Catholike, as they in theyr new Testament terme it a Papiste, is so knowne a vantage for euerie one, that either oweth them monie, or offereth them iniurie, that they can neyther claime their right, nor right theyr vvronges: but their aduersaries straight leauing the mainepointe, pleadeth against them for theyr Recusancie. And thus trauersing theyr suites, often causeth theyr persons to be committed to prison. If any displeasing accident fall out, whereof the authors are eyther vnknowne or ashamed, Catholikes are made common Fathers to such infamous Orphanes, as though none vvere so fit sluces as they, to let out of euerie mans sinke, these vnsauorie reproches: not so much but the casuall fires that sometimes happen in London, the late vprores betweene Gentlemē & aprentises, were laid to our charge, thogh the occasioners of both were known so wel that the report against vs, could not but issue from an vndeserued malice: yea Hacket

a man so far from our Faith, as Infidelitie it selfe, and a little before so notorious a Puritane, that he was of cheefe reckoning among them; when hys blasphemies grew so great, hys articles so impious, that they made Christians eares to glow, and his adherents to blush: then was hee posted ouer to vs for a Papist, and so named to vulgar sort; so common a practise it is to bestowe vpon vs, the infamies of all offenders. I omitte the vniformed shame and contempt, that the very lawes lay vpon vs, condemning the chiefe function of our Religion, partly for treasonable, partly for punishable faultes: And pretending an auncient faith honoured in all former ages, to be so detestable a thing, that it should by a solemne Statute be thought necessarie to make it treason, to perswade any vnto it. I leaue the slaunders forged against Priests, after theyr Executions, purposely reserued till the parties were past answering, & then deuulged to make them hatefull. It vvere infinite to lay before your Maiesties eyes, all the crosses that in this world wee beare: which to men, whom eyther gentry or nobility maketh tender ouer theyr honours, cannot be but most bitter corrisiues: for they

neither dare reuenge their own quarrels for fear of double offence to god & your highnesse, nor hope to haue redresse in ordinary course, so far hath disfauor excluded them, from all needfull remedies: yet must your Maiesty be informed, (so vncharitable are our enimies) that we suffer nothing for Religion, whom onely in respecte of Religion these neglected miseries haue made most contemptible euery one doing vs wrong, to please our superiours, whom they see carelesse in yeelding vs any right. Nowe howe vndutifull an impeachment it was to the credit of your Maiesties words & writings, to publish vnder your Soueraigne title, that Catholikes for Religion are not impeached in their goods or lands, I leaue to effects to proue. And what is our recusancie, or refusall, to be present at their protestants seruice, but a meere matter of conscience, for as there is none so knowne, or vsuall a way to distinguishe any religion from other, as the externall rites and Sacraments peculiar to euery one, so can none more effectually denie his owne than by making open confession of a contrary speech by his assistance & present at the solemnities & seruice proper to it. For not onely he that denieth

Christ in his heart, but he also that denieth or is ashamed of him, shall in the latter day be denied of him before his Angells. And seeing men iudge best of our minds, by our actions, we cannot possibly giue any greater profe vnto them, that we are no Catholikes, than if we ioine with Protestantes, in their Churches & seruice, by which, as then most certaine and speciall markes, they thē selues are knowne to be of that opiniō. We therfore, not gainesaid by Caluin, Melancihō, or any other learned Protestant, in this esteeme of voluntary presents, of any in or at the seruice of a contrary sect, a denial of his faith before men which being by Christ expressely prohibited cannot but be iudged a meere matter of conscience, & religion, & as such a one as is by vs refused, sith neither pleasure nor pollicie could otherwaies witholde vs, our refusall redounding to our so great trouble and disaduantage, for first ther are twenty pounds by the moneth exacted of such as are to pay it after thirteene moneths by the yere, an account vnusuall in all other causes, as the lawes commonlye read Printed and practised witnesseth, and multitudes of the vnabler sort of catholikes daily feele, that al their goods, & third part of their lands are ceased on, for their Recusancie

that cannot yeerly pay thirteenscore pounds for the same. And this is so perscribed, & performed with such rigor, that it is in the leases of Protestants hands by a special prouiso, ordained that recusants should not be so much as tenantes to their owne landes, so seuerely is their religion punished in that behalfe: yea & this lawe hath bin so seuerely executed, that whereas poore farmers and husbandmen, had but one Cowe for themselues, & many children to liue vpon it, that for their Recusancie hath bin taken from them, & wher both kine & cattle were wanting, they haue taken their couerlets, sheets, & blankets frō their bedds, their victualls & pore prouision frō their houses, not sparing so much as the very glasse from their windowes, when they founde nothing else to serue their turnes withal, which most pittiful abuses pore souls both in the North & other countries, haue bin continually cū
               bred, no cōplaints taking place, where these outrages were, rather commēded for good seruices, than rebuked for misdemeanours. So irreuocably are we condemned to a seruile bondage. And if your Maiesty did but knowe what other extreame penury & desolation, they ordinarily feel, your merciful

hart, neuer hardned to see lamētable spoiles would rather haue the lawes repealed, than the execution so intollerable. It is not possible to expresse in words the continual hel we suffer by the merciles searching & storming of purseuants & such needy officers, that care not by whose fall they rise, not hauing any deserts or other degrees, to clime to the hight of their ambition, but by the punishment & paines of poore Catholikes. They water their foūtains with the showres of our tenderest vaines, & builde their houses with the ruines of ours, tempering the morter of their foundations, with our innocent blod: our liuings are but snares for the owners liues, commonly made the fee of ery mercenary mouth, that can by sounding our disgraces into credulous eares, procure themselues warrants to seaze vpon our substance. They make our willes before we be sicke, bequeathing to their owne vses, what share they like, & by displāting our ofspring adopt thēselues to be heirs of our lands, beging & broking for thē, as if we were either condēned for fooles, or in perpetuall minority, & not contented with our wealth, they persecute our liues, neuer thinking their possessiō sure, til the assurance be seasoned

with our death. So easie it is for our enimies to quench their angry thirste in our blood: yea we are made so common forage for all hungry cattell, that euen the theeues with scutchins & counterfait warrants, haue vnder the pretence of purseuants spoiled vs in our houses, hauing the officers to assiste thē in their robberies, so ready they are at euery ones call, to practise their autority to our vexation, and so well knowne it is to euery way beater howe openly Catholikes lye to the pray. And though some very fewe finde more fauor being able to follow it with golden petitions, yet al the rest, whose meaner estates cānot reach the charge of such costly friends, are made common blottes, open to euery chance of the dice, to giue entry to their aduersaries, by their displeasing their owne seruantes & tennantes crowing ouer them, and vaunting that euerie pawne may giue their mate to their highest fortune: for be he neuer so base that playeth with them, with the least aduantage, he is sure that many will backe him in it, and haue the tricke with a sure help, thogh it be the son that taketh against his father, or any faulty drudge that for feare of correction accuseth his master. It were infinite to set downe the laborinth

of our afflictions, in which, what way soeuer we go, it is but a loosing of our selues & a vvinding of vs further into an endles course of calamities. Let this suffice, that now so heauie is the hand of our superiours against vs, that we generally are accounted men, whō it is a credit to pursue, a disgrace to protect, a commodity to spoile, againe to torture, & a glory to kill. We presume that your Maiesty seldome or neuer heareth the truth of our persecutions, your lenitie and tendernes being knowne to be so professed an enimy to these cruelties, that you would neuer permit their countenance, if they were but expressed to your highnes as they are practised vpon vs: yet sith we can bring the ruine of our houses, the consumption of our goods, the pouerty of our estates, & the weeping eyes of our desolate families, for palpable witnesses of the truth of these cō
               plaints. Let vs not be so farre exiled out of the limets of all compassions, as besides all other euils to haue it confirmed with your Maiesties hand, that wee suffer no punishment for religion, suffering in proofe all punishments, for nothing els: we haue beene long enough cut from all comforts, & stinted by an endlesse taske of sorrowes growing

in griefes, as we grow in yeares, one misery oretaketh another, as thogh euery one were but in earnest of a harder paiment; we haue some small hope that our continued patience, and quiet effusion of our bloodat your Maiesties feete, would haue kindled some sparke of remorse towards vs: but still we see that wee are not yet at the depth of our misfortunes, we must yet tread the restles maze of new agreeuance, sith wee perceaue by this Proclamation, that our cause is too farre for being pittied, that it is not so much as knowne, where it can only be redressed: yet sith help neuer commeth too late, to so helples creatures, who dayly are drawen neerely to the brinke of a generall distruction, vvhich some that giue ayme to your Maiesty, seeme willing that you shuld discharge vpō vs: we are forced to deuulge our petitions by many mouthes to opē vnto your Highnes our humble suits: for neither our selues to present thē in person (being terrified by the president of imprisonment, that last attempted it) nor hauing the fauour of any such patron, as would be willing to make himselfe our mediator to your Maiestie: we are forced to commit it to the multitude, hoping that amōg so many, that

shall peruse this short & true relation of our troubles, GOD will touch some mercifull hart, to let your highnes vnderstand the extremitie of thē, which if we were once sure to haue beene effectually performed, wee might either set vp our rest, 
                  •
               n an vnflexable sentence of misery, which we hope shall neuer proceed from so easie and gratious a Iudge, as your sacred selfe, or either expect some lenity to allay the anger of our smart, a thing more incident vnto the milde temper of so excellent a minde. In the meane season, we humbly craue pardō of this forced defence, & necessary supplicatiō, which was extorted from vs by open & vnsupportable vntruthes, no lesse needfull for your maiesty to know, thē for vs to disproue; imploying the vndeserued touch of your Maiesties word, & playning the direct path, to our intended subuersion; Accept it therefore (most mercifull Princesse) and all our humble duties & faithes with it, which with most loyall thoughts, & seruiceable resolulutions, are vnfainedlie betrothed to your Maiesties defence. God of his infinite goodnes prosper and preserue you to his glorie, your subiects comfort, and your own, both temporall and eternall happinesse. December 14. Anno. 1595. FINIS.
