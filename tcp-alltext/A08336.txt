                  ¶ To the right reuerende father in God, William, by the mercifull prouidence of God, through Iesus Christe, Bishop of Excester, Jhon Northbrooke wisheth all health and godlinesse long to continue, with the encrease of vertue, and zeale in religion.
            
            
               
                  COnsidering with my selfe (ryght reuerende father in God) the daungerous practises of the Papistes, in these our dayes: who are euer redyer to put men in doubt, then to establishe them in the true Christian faith: more apt to bring them to desperation, then to true consolation by faith in Christe: more diligent to moue them to beleue man, then God: antechrist then Christ: the Pope, then the Scriptures: to trust to our owne workes then his merites: the massing sacrifice then, Christes oblation: popishe pardons then free forgiuenesse in Christe: to honour a wafer cake for Christe, geuyng to the creature that is due vnto the Creator, making more of Sacramentes, then the nature of Sacramentes require: not vsing them, but abusing them: not referring nor applying them, but adoring them, turnyng religion into superstion: faith into opinion: and the true seruing of God into idolatrie: hauing vnder the visour of their vowed chastitie, adulterie: vnder the cloke of professed pouertie, all the goodes of the temporaltie: vnder the title of being dead vnto the world, they ruled the worlde: vnder the keyes to hang vnder their girdle, they brought all estates into the gulfe of ignoraunce, whereout commeth all heresies and errours, (saith S. Augustine) and yet as saint Paul saith, habentes speciem pietatis,
               
                  Aug. de ciuit. dei. lib. 22. cap. 22. Psal. 119. 
               sed vim eius abnegantes. Whereby they may abuse the simple peoples iudgementes, that they in no wise may knowe or vnderstande (through their hypocrisie) Gods holy worde, which lighteth our feete: stayeth our goinges: ordereth our mindes: gouerneth our bodies: directeth all our workes and affaires: teaching

vs what we ought to do, and what we ought not to do, without which worde, neither king can raigne, lorde nor magistrate rule: nor subiect truely obey, as they ought to do: nor yet order well those things that are committed to their charge. And for that the simple ignoraunt people are caried so easily away, with the only sounde and voyce of the Papistes, by the names of the auncient Fathers and Doctours, from the true religion of Christ Iesus, made me to enterprise and take in hande, (although of all others moste vnmeete) this rude and simple worke: and the rather for that those that daily crie out that this religion is a newe religion, which was neuer allowed by the holy and Canonical scriptures: fathers, and counsels, that we nowe preach and mainteine in these our dayes. Whose mouthes, to stop & stay their cryinges out (if it may be) I haue here gathered (reuerende Father) together, certayne places of holy Scriptures, Fathers, and Counsels, (as concerning the principall pointes of relgion) wherein the simple and ignoraunt may playnely, and clearely see, as it were in a glasse, what side holdeth of Christe most truely: who preacheth Christ most faithfully: whose religion is best allowed by the Scriptures: confirmed by the Martyrs▪ mainteined and taught by the Fathers, the Papistes or the Protestantes: wherein they shall easily perceiue and vnderstand, that our religiō is the olde, true and catholique religion. And that the Papistes religion (which our late Louanistes, and Hardonians so stoutely mainteyne) is but a newe start vp, and deuised religion, (cleane cōtrary and against the word of God: godly Fathers, and good counsels) by certaine whoremaisters, Coniurers, Sorcerers, Traytors, Bastardes and Sodomites, Popes of Rome, with others. And although it is to be lamented to see the corrupt nature of man, who is giuen, not to beleeue Christe, without the ancthoritie and witnesse of man, (who may rather therefore be called Patrologie then Theologie) yet for that God hath geuen suche light vnto men, to be as witnesses of his trueth, I haue here put downe, first the Scriptures, the number of euery verse: and then followeth the consent of the Fathers, Counsels: yea, euen the Papistes owne doctours, decrees, and sentences, euen to the very lowest degrees of the Popes champions, Maister

D. Harding, whereby all men may see that Baalams Asses of Rome, speake trueth many tymes, although against their wylles. There are in deede many notable learned men (as your Lordship well knoweth) which haue gathered certen bookes of common places in the Latine tongue: but that is to the ignoraunt that vnderstandeth it not, as the kernell within the shell to a litle weake childe. Wherefore, I haue by earnest request made by certayne of my freendes (whom wel I 
                  •…
               oulde not denye) taken this labour in hande: only for Gods honour and glories sake, and helpyng forwarde of my poore brethren, and countreymen, to the knowledge of Gods trueth in religion, that haue bene, and dayly are abused by the Papistes, with the names and titles of Fathers, and Counsels, to minister them weapons out of the Scriptures, and Doctours, wherewith they may beate downe their enimies, whensoeuer they shall seeme to open their mouth against Gods true religion, noweset foorth and taught of all the godly Bishoppes and Preachers. In this worke (reuerende Father) I haue not corrupted the Doctours wordes willingly: but simply and playnely set them downe, as I reade and finde them in their owne bookes: rather shewing my selfe homely and playne according to my skyll, then by ouermuch finenesse aboue my reache, to dissent from the minde of the Scriptures and Fathers.
            Nowe what thing shoulde I deuise to pleasure your Lordship better: and that whiche agreeth so well with your estate and callyng, to be a Father in Christ his Church, then the manifestation of the holy Scriptures and Fathers, whiche fully allowe and mainteyne the religion nowe set foorth, whiche alwayes (as I haue vnderstanded) you haue sought: and of all true professours thereof, you haue bene a louer and defendour. Therefore I do here present, and dedicate this simple worke (of the poore mans Garden) vnto your Lordship, taking your name for a patrone and defendour against the bityng furies of snuffyng detractours: and momishe affections of bityng zoilous persons, and heretical papistes, who dayly do enuie al good and godly doinges and exercises. And also to declare my heartie good wyll towardes you, and the naturall loue I beare to my

natiue countreymen of Deuonshire. Most humbly beseeching your Lordship therefore, to take this poore and small rude labour of mine in good part, and accept my good meanyng herein, which tendeth to the only glory of God: aduauncement of his kingdome, profite of my sayde countreymen, and to the ouerthrowe of all Gods enimies the Papistes, which haue kept the people in darknesse palpable, in horrours infinite, and in feare miserable, beseeching the Lord God, that if the greatnesse of feare wyll not incite them, yet the hope of saluation maye alure them from their wickednesse, to his glorie, and their owne saluation, through Iesus Christ. And that in the meane tyme, your Lordship with all other godly preachers & teachers, may reproue sinne and poperie sharply: preache Christ sweetely: impugne errours pithily: and to perswade to good life earnestly. Thus I leaue, any further troublyng you with my rude and homely stile and phrase of writyng, beseching God to blesse, kepe, and maintayne you in his feare: enriching you with al good blessinges: and alwayes gouerning you in all your affaires and doings, by his holy spirite, vnto the ende, and in the ende.

                  ¶ To the Christian reader, grace, peace, and health in Christe.
            
            
               GOD in the beginning when he created the earth, gaue vertue to the same, to bring foorth euery hearbe of the fielde, that might beare seede in him selfe, after his owne kinde, without gardening, digging, sowing, plantyng, weedyng, or any other trauayle of man. But after that man had transgressed, the earth receyued the curse due to mans offence, that is, to bring foorth thornes and thistles: and as man was defiled, and coulde yeelde foorth no good fruite, except he were delued by Gods spirite, and the seede of Gods worde sowen into him, which by the influence of the same spirite, might bud out the leaues, stalkes, and blossomes of grace, which ripeth in time of it selfe, so the earth then remayned to man as a thing tillable, out of the which by continuall eradication of weedes, and by digging and deluing the grounde, plantyng and sowyng of good and commodious hearbes and fruites, he might receyue vnto him selfe by continuall trauayle and labour in the sweat of his face, thinges necessarie for his comfort and bodily sustentation. Hence groweth it also that nowe vnto this day, men, the terrestriall heires of Adam, digge, delue, plowe, hedge, ditche, eare, sowe, threshe, cull, weede, plant, set, graft, proine and such like, vpon the face of this trauayle some grounde, in the which as the preacher saith, when man hath laboured what he may, Quid vtilitatis est homini, de vniuerso labore suo, quo laborat sub sole? What profite hath man more of all the labour wherewith he weerieth him selfe, vnder the Sunne, but sorowe and care, and nothing without paynes and greefe. Also Euripides saith to euery man: 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . That is, if thou which art borne mortall, doe thinke thy selfe to liue without labours and vnquietnes, thou arte a foole: and what could of a Pagan be I pray you more wisely spokē, or diuinely? The plowman reapeth not till he haue daunced after the Plowshare, holdyng fast the handle, pochyng in mire, vp to the calfe of the legge, he filles not his handes with the eares, till he haue parched and well koned them, with sustainyng the bitter blowes of the pearcyng Haile, beatyng with bityng showers & frost by vehemence of the Northest winde. He filles not his bellie with bread, before he haue well wet his backe with Snowe and Raine. No man drinkes wine before the Grapes be planted, no man eateth pure fruict before he haue grafted, the Marchaunt receiues not his gaine without greate feares, perils, and aduentures by Sea, by lande, by night and daie, and that not without manie vnknowen and greate losses. No man hath the pleasure of a holsome Garde

            Yet notwithstandyng, all men are not so mindefull of their firste fall, or els of their present labours, that either they do bewaile their miserie, or seke to employe their labours aright: For where the onely ende of Adams trauaile is, that he maie eate, that is, that he maie gather comfort, and releefe in his necessitie: Many are so forgetfull of their miseries, that the studie of their whole life, is onlie employed to satis

For as a good phisition is well grounded in the nature of Hearbes and Plantes, whereof are made salues and remedies for the diseases of the bodie, and is neuer destitute either of a good Garden, well replenished with al maner holsome hearbes, or else of a trustie learned Apothecarie to prouide the same: So God doth neuer leaue his ordinarie meanes vnoccupied and vnprouided, wherby the Vlcers and Blai

I speake neither against anie honourable or worshipfull mans pleasure or prosperitie, whiche is made for the encrease and preseruation of health, but against vaine and superfluous gardening. Gardens are wholsome, healthfull, and commodious for two causes. First, for the ayre sake, for where manie kinde of sweete hearbes, grow together, there must of necessitie be an excellent composition of aire, whereby the senses of man are both holpen and rele

Secondlie for medicine sake, bicause, of hearbes are made the moste excellent medicines, salues, and emplaisters for the expulsing of all maner diseases and infections of the bodie. But notwithstanding the commoditie be greate, yet for the most part it is priuate, for commonlie those that make faire Gardens, thei do so inclose them with huge walles, and high pales, that none hath the fruit of them but them selues, and in the richer mens Gardens, the more seldome do poore men reape anie pleasure by them. But herein I must, as I haue good occasion, commende the labour of this spirituall Gardener, our deere and painefull brother, Iohn Northbrooke, whose Garden is not onelie painefullie purged and cleansed of all weedes, but well furnished with all maner of moste excellent hearbe
                  •…
                and flowers, that maie serue to the comforte of the spirituall senses of the faithfull, and for the curing of all diseases of the minde and conscience infected with the corruption, either of the foule blacke aire of ignoraunce, or pestiferous sayinges and decrees of false doctrine and heresie.
            Whiche spirituall Garden, after that with greate labour and studie he had brought about to finishe, hauing taken great paines no doubt, in gettyng out of many Gardens, the most excellent Slippes, Seedes & Plantes, and after that he had brought to passe, that no good hearbe was wanting, that might any thing profit or benefit such as are desirous of their soules health. He neither hath walled it about with great Bricke walles, nor hedged it about with quick thornes, neither paled it in, whereby it might seeme that he bestowed this cost for himselfe, and this paines only for his owne cōmoditie, as the maner of the world is to do: he hath franckly and freely, with all the commodites thereof, left it open to all maner of men: nay, more then so, that he hath made it a common Garden, he hath onely planted it, and geuen it to the poore, it is a common Garden for the poore, you maie be bolde to call it the poore mans Garden, out of which notwithstanding, both riche and poore, mai

And none that shall haue occasion to walke in it, but he shall haue great cause to praise God for the commoditie that shall come to the faithfull by the paine and trauaile of this godlie and vigelant Pastour and Minister of Gods Church, Iohn Northbrooke, whose soundnesse of doctrine, modestie, integritie of life, and vpright conuersation, shineth, not only in this his labour, to the example of al the rest of Gods Ministers, but is also very apparant in his maners, and whosoeuer of parcialitie, purpose, or selfe affection, doth or shall go about to saie or maintayne the contrarie, others that shoulde heare it, knowing our godlie brother, and faithfull Minister of the Church, Iohn Northbrooke (who is a man not vnknowen, but by face well

acquainted) shall and maie iustly accuse such of no small iniurie done to the Church and Ministers of Christ, especially in these perillous times, where the good name of a faithfull Minister (walke he neuer so vprightly) is not so easily preserued and kept, as mischieuously stollen and purloyned from him, by the enuious and spitefull Papistes, and Newters, which are with Lyn

I will let passe to speake any more of the person, I will speake of his painefull trauaile, godlie zeale, and faithfull affection to Gods Churche, and for the helpe of the memorie of his fellowe Ministers, doth shewe, and plainely set foorth in this his most christian and godlie worke, so profitable to all, and vnprofitable to none, that euerie man shal finde great assistaunce in hauing it, and much dammage in wanting it: For if I shall speake of the worthinesse of it, it is so worthie, as neuer any thing in my iudgement, in our time, in our barbarous rude tongue, of an Englishe mans compilyng, and of no greater volume, well waying the richnesse of the matter, hath bene printed a worthier. This worke is not in vaine called the poore mans Garden, for it is a riche bed of all sweete flowers, that is, a breefe collection and vnifourme consent of fragrant sweete smelling Scriptures, and fruitfull agreement of the soundest iudgement of the Doctours, which haue on the Scriptures builded long ago their faith and true religion, nowe gathered together for the profite of the ignoraunt and

The Anabaptist, the Pelagian, and the Arian hither resorting, maie gather amongst these leaues, medecines of health.

The poore plowman maie, hauing this litle booke often to studie vpon, easily learne in the plaine mother tongue, not only to giue a sound reasō of his owne faith, which aswell apperteyneth to the Carter and Plowman, as to the Doctour and Bachiler of Diuinitie: but hereout he maie also arme him selfe with trueth, that all the subtile Sophistrie of the diuine and sorbonistes Papistes, shall neither make him doubt or be offended at the trueth. Finally, none that loueth Iesus Christe the sonne, and surest pointes of his doctrine: namely, of faith in the Gospell, but he will be farre in loue with this Garden: but aboue all, my brethren of the Ministerie, to Whom God hath not geuen the gift of tongues, this is to you no small benefite, for whose sakes cheefly the aucthour hath taken this paine. God graunt that no lesse aduantage may come to euery member of the Church of God by the same (gentle reader) then the present worke it selfe doth shewe was sought and desired of the writer, which may yet encourage him to take more paynes, and stirre vp all the rest of able Ministers to set foorth their talentes, to encrease, for the profite of the Church of Christ as he hath done. The Haruest is great, God sende painefull labourers into the feelde, and their labours diligently employed, God geue encrease, that it may fructifie in his faithfull peoples heartes, and yeelde foorth fruite mightily, that on euery part Christ may be glorified, with his heauenly father, and the holy ghost, worlde without ende,

Accordyng to the example in the whiche he spake to Moises, I will haue mercie, on whom I will haue mercie: Sithe it is thus, as he saieth: we muste graunte, that God dooeth what so euer he will. And without any merites, and woorkes, he doeth either predestinate, and electe: Or els condemne some. Therefore, it is not in the will of the runner, but in the mercie of God. But specially in that same scripture that is, where the same God speaketh to Pharao, for this purpose haue I stirred thee vp, that I maie declare my power vpon thee, and that my name maie be shewed in all the earth.
                  Sithe it is thus, that for his owne sake, he sheweth mercie vnto Israell, and hardeineth Pharao, therefore in vain doeth he seeke the cause, why he doeth not make vs good: or why he

doeth make vs euill, when it is in his owne power and will, without good or ill workes: either to chose or electe any, especially, when this fraile weakenes of our willes, cannot resist it. The heate of the Sunne is one, and yet by his power, he susteineth and hardeneth, looseth and bindeth, some thynges, it melteth waxe, it hardeneth the claie, and yet the heate is not diuerse in nature. So is the goodnesse and mercie of God: The vessells of wrathe, whiche are apte to death and destruction (that is) the people of Israell he dooeth harden. And the vessells of mercie, whiche he hath prepared to glorie, dooeth call them (that is) vs.

him, before the worlde was made. Certainly, if this be therefore spoken, because God knewe afore hande, that thei would beleue: the sonne speaketh against this forknowledge, saiyng. you haue not chosen me, but I haue chosen you.
                  Seeyng that God did rather knowe afore hande this, that thei should chose hym, that thei might deserue to bée chosen of him. Thei are therefore chosen, before the worlde was made, in that predestination, in the whiche God knewe afore hande his owne workes, that were to come: But their are chosen frō the worlde by that callyng, by the whiche, God hath fulfilled that, whiche he did predestinate. For, whom he hath predestinate, theim hath he called, that is to saie, with that callyng, that is accordyng to purpose: he hath not then called any other but those whom he hath predestinate, theim hath he also called: Neither hath he iustified any other, but them whom he so called, them hath he also iustified: Neither hath he glorified any other, but theim whom he hath predestinate, called, iustified, theim hath he also glorified, with that ende, whiche hath no ende.
                  God then hath chosen the faithfull: but that thei might bee made faithfull. The Apostle Iames saieth, hath not God chosen the poore in this worlde, riche in faithe, and heires of the kingdome, whiche God hath promised to thē that beleue him?
                  By election therefore, he maketh bothe riche in faithe, and heires of the kingdome, whom I praie you, hearyng the lorde saiyng, you haue not chosen me, but I haue chosen you. Dare bee so bolde, as to saie, that men are chosen through beliefe: whereas rather thei are chosen, that thei maie beleue, leaste that thei should bee founde, to haue chosen Christe firste, contrary to the sentence of the truthe, vnto whom Christ saieth: you haue not chosen me, but I haue chosen you.

maie followe the caller: the iudgementes of God are vnsearchable.
                  Notwithstandyng, this ought to bee moste certaine to the faithfull, that the one is of the nomber of the predestinate, but th'other is not: For if thei had been of vs (saieth one of the predestinate, whiche out of the Lordes breaste, did sucke this secrete) thei had vndoubtedly continued with vs. What meaneth this I praie you, thei were not of vs, for if thei had béen of vs, thei had certainly continued with vs? Were thei not both created of God: bothe borne in Adam: bothe made of the earth, and of hym whiche saied, I haue made all breathe: did thei not bothe receiue soules of one, and the self same nature? Laste of all, were thei not bothe called, and followed the caller, bothe of vngodlie, iustified, and bothe renewed by the fountaine of regeneration? But if he (whiche certainly knewe what he saied) should heare this, he might aunswere, and saie: These are true, and accordyng to all these thynges, thei were of vs: Neuerehelesse, by a certaine other difference, thei were not of vs, for if thei had been of vs, thei should vndoubtedly, haue cō
                     tinewed with vs, but in conclusion, what is this difference?
                  Gods bokes are open, let vs not tourne awaie our face, the diuine scripture doeth crie, lette vs therefore giue eare: Thei were not of them, because thei were not called, accordyng to purpose: thei were not electe in Christ, before the makyng of the world: thei were not made heires through hym: thei were not predestinate, accordyng to the purpose of hym that woorketh all thynges.

                      whereof it were to longe to make a whole recitall, it is (as I suppose) sufficiently shewed, that God dooeth woorke in the hartes of men, to encline their willes, whither it pleaseth hym, whether it be to good thynges, accordyng to his mercie, either to euill thynges accordyng to their merites, and accordyng to his owne iudgemente, whiche is sometyme open, and sometyme secrete, but alwaies iuste. For, this perswasion ought to bee fixed, and vnmoueable in our hartes: that there is none iniquitie with God. And hereby, when ye reade in the writynges of the truthe, that God doeth leade men out of the waie, or that he doeth dull, or harden their hartes: doe ye not doubt, but that their euill deseruynges went before, that thei might iustly suffer these thynges, leaste ye should runne into

that Prouerbe of Salomon, the foolishnesse of a man, doeth defile his waies, but in his harte, he laieth the blame to God.

And so nothyng maie bee referred to the predestination of God, more then that, whiche appertaineth to the due rewarde of iustice, or to the vndeserued gifte of grace, or mercie.
                  That many doeth perishe, it is the merite of them that perishe,In his. 2. aunsvvere, to the articles, vvhich are falsely imposed vpon S. Augustine. that many are saued, it is the gifte of sauyng. That the guiltie shalbe damned, the iustice of God is vnmoueable, that the guiltie shalbe iustified, it is the greate goodnesse and grace of God.

order of causes is fatall, or rather that doe giue it the name of destinie, whiche thyng we doe abhorre, chiefly for the name, whiche is not accustomed to bee vnderstanded, in the thyng it self. But where as he doeth denye, that the order of all causes is moste certaine, and knowen to the prescience of God: wee doe detest hym more then the Stoikes did: for, either he doeth denie that there is a God, whiche thyng in his bookes, concernyng the nature of the Goddes, he doth vnder an other mans persone endeuour to doe: or els if he doe confesse that there is a God, whō he denieth to knowe, of thynges before thei come to passe, euen so saiyng, he dooeth none other thyng, then did that foolishe man, whiche saied in his harte, there is no God. For, he that dooeth not knowe aforehande, all thynges that are to come, doubtlesse the same is not God.
                  We saie not that all thinges do come to passe by destinie: yea, we saie that nothing is doen by destinie. For, we do plainly shewe, that the name of destinie, is of no value, in the place, where men vse to place it in speakyng, that is ut the constitution of the heauenly signes, wherein euery man is conceiued and borne, because the thyng it self is vainly affirmed. As for the order of causes, wherein the will of God is of greate force and power: we dooe neither denie, nor call it by the name of destinie, excepte it be so as we maie vnderstande, fatum, to be deriued of the woorde, for faris, that is, of speakyng. For, wee cannot denie, but it is written in the holie scriptures: GOD spake ones, these twoo saiynges: I my self heard it: that power belongeth vnto God: And vnto thée (O Lorde) belongeth mercie: for thou wilt giue to euery man, according to his workes. And where as it is saied, he spake ones: wee vnderstande that he spake vnmoutablie, that is vnchaungeablie, euen as he did vnchaungeably knowe all thynges that are to come, and that he hymself will dooe. After this sorte therefore, wee maie saie, fatum, or destinie is deriued; a fando, or speakyng, if this name had not now been accustomed, to bee vnderstanded of an other matter, wherunto we are not willyng, that mensIn the. 10. chapiter of the same. 5. boke. hartes should be enclined.
                  The life of man is euill, when his belief concernyng God,

is not good. Wherefore be it farre from vs, that we, to thende that we our selues would be free, should denie the prouidence of hym, by whom we are, or shalbe free. Therefore lawes, reprehensions, exhortations, commaundementes, and sharpe rebukes, are not in vain: because that bothe he did knowe before hande, that the
                        •…
                      should come to passe, and also thei are of greate force, euen of as greate force, as he did foreknowe that thei should be. And iust rewardes are appointed for good workes, and punishmentes for synnes. Neither doeth man sinne, because God did foreknowe before, that he should synne, yea, rather it is therefore out of doubte, that he doeth synne, when he doeth synne: because he, whose foreknowledge, cannot bee deceiued, did knowe before, that it was not destinie, nor fortune, or any other thyng, that should synne, but he hym self. Whiche if he be not willyng: he synneth not at all. But if he should not bee willyng to synne: God did also knowe that before.

It is knowen what he made hym self. Fallyng out of the hande of the Potter, he was broken. For he that made hym, did gouerne hym, but he was willyng to forsake hym that made hym. And God suffered hym so to doe, as it were saiyng thus: Let hym forsake me, that he maie finde hym self, and that he maie by his miserie proue, that without me he can doe nothyng. By this meane therefore would God shewe vnto man: what freewill is able to doe without God.

Some not vnderstandyng this wel, are deceiued, in somuche that thei beleue, that to prepare the harte, that is to begin goodnesse, without the helpe of the grace of God, pertaineth vnto man. God forbid that the children of promise so vnderstande it, as though thei would cōfute the lorde, wheras thei haue heard him, saiyng: without me ye can doe nothyng, and saie: beholde, we are able of our selues to prepare our harte, and by that to thinke some goodnes. Who can with a good thought, prepare his harte vnto goodnesse?
                  God forbidde that any man should vnderstande it so, saue the proude defendours of their will. Therefore it is written, it is the mans parte to prepare the harte, and the aunswere of the tongue is of the Lorde, because the man prepareth the harte, yet for all that, not without the helpe of God.
                  It is saied also after this maner: open my mouthe, and I shall fulfill it. For although we can not open our mouthes, excepte he helpe vs, without whom we can doe nothing, yet we open by his helpe and woorkyng, and he fulfilleth that thyng, either with our worke, or without our worke. For, what is it to prepare the harte, and to open the mouthe, but to prepare the will. And yet for all that, it is read in the same letters: the will is prepared, and made readie before of God, and I shall open thy mouthe, and I shal teache thée what good thinges thou oughtest to speake. Wherefore, God doeth many good thinges in a man, that man doeth not, but a man doeth no good thynges, whiche God hath not doen, that a man should doe:

                  No man can bee continente, excepte the Lorde giueth it,In the same 89. Epistle. therefore God commaundeth continence, and he giueth continence: he commaundeth by the lawe, he giueth by grace: he commaundeth by the letter, he giueth by the spirite.
                  
                     Therefore, that we should beleue in God, and liue godlie,In his. 107. Epistle to vitalis. it lieth not in the will, or runnyng of man, but in the mercie of God: not, that we ought not bothe to wil and to runne. But because that he hym self doeth worke in vs, bothe to will, and also to runne.
                  The lawe is giuen, that grace should bée sought for: GraceIn his boke of true innocencie the. 44. chapiter. is giuen, that the lawe should bee fulfilled: It is not through the fault of the lawe, that it was not fulfilled: but through the wisedome of the fleshe: whiche faulte is declared by the lawe, that by grace it might be healed.In his boke of correction and grace the. 3. chapiter.
                  
                  O man, knowe in the commaundementes what thou art bounde to doe: in rebukyng, learne that through thyne owne fault, thou haste it not, and in praier learne whence thou must receiue that thyng that thou wilte haue.
                  The firste man had not this grace, whereby he should neuerIn the same booke and. 11. chapiter. bee willyng to be euill: but yet he had that grace, whereby he might haue been alwaies preserued from euill, if he would haue continued therein. And without whiche also he could not by freewill bee good, but yet he was able, by freewill to forsake it.
                  GOD therefore would not haue hym to bee without his grace, whom he had left in his owne freewill. For, freewill is able enough to dooe euill, but to dooe good it hath no power at all, except it be holpen by the almightie goodnes, whiche help, if that man had not by freewill forsaken, he should haue been good for euer: but he did forsake, and was forsaken. For the helpe was suche, that he might forsake it, when he would, not such wherby it might come to passe, that he should be willing.

                  There be certaine bokes of our Lorde, vnto the aucthoritie whereof eche parte agreeth, there let vs séeke for the Church: therby let vs trie and examine our matters.
                  I will, ye shewe mée the holy Churche, not by the decrées of men: but by the worde of God.In the. 16. cap of the same boke.
                  
                  Whether they haue the Churche, or no, let theim shewe

by the Canonicall bookes of the holy Scriptures, wee muste knowe the churche of Christe, euen like as we knowe christe, which is the heade of the churche, in the holy Canonicall scriptures.
                  The question or doubte is, where the Churche shoulde be,In the. 2. chap. of the same booke. what then shall we doe? Whether shall we séeke the churche in our owne wordes, or in the wordes of her heade, whiche is our Lorde Iesus Christ? In my iudgement, we ought rather to seeke the churche in his woordes: for that he is the trueth, and best knoweth his owne body.
                  Let vs not heare these wordes: this saie I, this saiest thou:In the. 3. chap. of the same booke. But these wordes let vs heare, thus saieth the lorde: there let vs seeke the churche: there let vs discusse our cause.
                  Whether of vs be Schismatikes, we, or you, aske you notIn his. 2. boke and. 85. chap. against the letters of Petilian. mée, I will not aske you: Let Christe be asked: that he maie shewe vs his owne churche.
                  The holy Scriptures sheweth the Churche, without any doubtefulnes.In his. 1. booke and. 33. chap. against Cresconius the Grammarian. Chrisostome in his. 49. Homily of the vnperfecte worke vpon Matth.
                  
                  When you shall see the abhomination of desolation stande in the holie place, that is, when you shall see vngodlie heresie (whiche is the army of Antichrist) stande in the holy places of the churche, in that time let theim which are in Iurie, flie vnto the Hilles (that is) let theim that be in christendome, resort vnto the scriptures.
                  For like as the true Iewe is a christian (as the Apostle saieth, he is not a Iewe, whiche is outwarde. &c.) In like maner, the very Iewry is christianitie, the Hilles are the scriptures of the Apostles and prophetes.
                  And why doeth he commaunde all christians at that tyme to resorte to the Scriptures? For in this tyme, since Heresie hath preuailed in the churche, there can be no other proofe of true christianitie, neither can there be any other refuge for christian men (willing to knowe the trueth of the right faith) but onely vnto the holy Scriptures. Before tyme, it was shewed by many other meanes, whiche was the true Churche of Christe, and whiche Gentilitie: But nowe there is no other waie to know it. And why? For all those thinges which pertains

to Christe in déede, haue the Heretiques in their Schismes: likewise churches: likewise the Scriptures of GOD: likewise Bishops, and other orders of Clarkes: and likewise Baptisme: and the Sacramente of thankesgiuyng, and (to conclude) Christe hym selfe.
                  Wherefore, he that will knowe whiche is the true church of Christ, in this so greate a confusion of thinges, being so like: howe shall he knowe it, but onely by the scriptures?
                  It was also knowen which was the true church of christe, by their maners, when the conuersation of christian men (either of al, or many) was holy, which was not among the heathen.
                  But nowe, Christian men are become like, or worse then the Gentiles or Heretiques: yea, and there is more continencie founde amongest theim, then among christians.
                  Therfore, he that will knowe which is the true churche of Christ, wherby shal he knowe it, but onely by the scriptures.
                  The Lorde therefore knowyng that so greate a confusion of thinges should come in the later tyme, commaundeth that christian men, that be willyng to know the right faith, should flee to none other thinges, but onely to the Scriptures: for if they looke vpon any other thyng, but onely the scriptures, thei will be offended and perishe, not perceiuyng which is the true churche: And so to fall into the abhomination of desolation, whiche standeth in the holy places of the churche.

And if wee require an example, who was iustified (sola fide) by faith onely without workes, I suppose that the same thief doth suffice, who, when he was crucified with Christe, did crie vnto hym from the crosse: Lorde Iesu, remember me when thou commest into thy kingdome. Neither any other good worke of his is described or set foorth vnto vs in the Gospels. But for (ha

                  This thief then was iustified by faith without the workes of the lawe. For, the lorde did not vpon this require what hee had wrought before, neither did he loke what worke he should doo after he did beleue, but beeyng readie to enter into Paradise, hee tooke hym for his waityng man: beeyng iustified by that confession onely.
                  The grace of God is geuen only of mercie, and fauour: andHesichius in his. 4. boke & 14. Chap. vpon Leuiticus. is imbraced and receiued (sola fide) by onely faith.

                  That at length is a perfecte and founde reioysing in God,Basile in his Homili of humilitie. when a man doth not brag or boast of his owne righteousnes, he is iustified (sola fide) by faith onely in christe.

                     Cornelius when he praied, was holpen by his owne faith,In his boke against the Donatistes. and not by the faith of others that stoode by.

                  If Abraham (in offeryng vp his sonne) had not doen it in a true faithe, it had little or nothyng profited hym, whatsoeuer worke that shoulde haue been.
                  Those which are saide to be workes before faith: although they seeme neuer so laudable to men, they are vaine and nothyng.
                  Where faithe is not, good woorkes is not: the intent maketh a good worke: but faith directeth that intent.
                  Many dothe glory of woorkes. And thou shalt finde many Paganes doe the same: but thei are not therfore made christistians: as though their good life were sufficient to theim, they saie, I haue doen no murther, nor thefte, nor haue taken anie woman, he hath to glorie: but not with God.

there hath none had life without faith. But the thief beleued onely, and was made righteous of the most mercifull God.
                  And here leste thou saie vnto mee, that he wanted tyme, wherin that he might liue iustely and doe good workes: About this I will not contende and striue.
                  But this will I holde and saie, that onely faithe by it selfe did saue hym. But this is nowe asked, and is in hande to be intreated, that faith by it selfe hath saued: And that woorkes by theim selues, did neuer iustifie or make righteous any workers. Wilt thou see plainely that workes without faith doth not quicken and giue life? Cornelius had a good testimonie and reporte for his almes and praiers: But he knewe not christe: yet beleeuyng that there was a God, and was not taught the worde of God. And bicause the workes was good and wonderfull, thei pleased God, the rewarder and louer of goodnesse and trueth (I meane) the righteous iudge, whiche is not partiall, and regardeth not one more thē another, did sée the good workes (I graunte) but deade and without life, bicause they had not faith, he sendeth his diuine Angell ministring, to gette rewardes to his workes, that in fightyng well, he maie be rewarded for his faith, whiche saieth vnto him, Cornelius, Thy praiers hath ascended. &c. And therfore workes could not saue, for if he bee saued and all his house, with those thynges that Peter preached, Cornelius had not at that time saluatiō of his woorkes, till that faith offered a rewarde to be obtained vnto his workes. &c. Therefore faith muste shine before woorkes, and workes must bee hand maides, and waiters of faith, and folowe her.

                  And your Priestes, bicause euen they be bondes, hath not authoritie to forgeue other men their synnes. The whiche thyng Paule sheweth more plainly, saiyng: the Prieste hath neede to offer for hym selfe, as well as for the people, for he is also subdued and in daunger of infirmity. The seruaunt saith, he abideth not in the house, that is, hath no power to expende and paie forth, bicause he is not the goodman of the house, that is the lorde of the house, but the sonne is the lord of the house, and abideth in the house. He meaneth by the house, power: as in another place, he meaneth by it, rule and dominion: saiyng: in my fathers house, are many Mansions.
                  Therefore your Priestes, bicause they are bondes and seruauntes, hath not authoritie to forgiue and release synne.

of hym, three confessions of his loue: that the three denialles might be counteruailed and recompensed with equal nomber of confessyng. So that, that is committed in wordes, is cured with woordes: Christe asked of hym whether heé loued hym more then another? for he whiche experted greater clemencie of the lorde towardes hym: ought of right to be affected with greater loue.
                  For although generally all the disciples were striken with greate feare, when the Lorde was betraied: yet the faulte of Peter was greater, whiche denied Christ in so short a tyme. Bicause therefore he obtained remission of synnes by greater clemencie of the Sauiour: greate loue of right is required of hym. For he to whom more is forgiuen, ought more to loue.
                  Therefore, by the three confessions of Peter, the crime of the three denials was made voide, and put awaie. And where Christ saide, feede my sheepe, renued that dignitie of the Apostleship by humaine infirmitie, he shoulde seeme to be abased and made weake.
                  For this, as I iudge, Peter receiued this commaundementBernarde of the resurrection of our Lorde, in his first Sermō. of the lorde, thrise to feede his flocke, feede (saieth he) with thy minde: feede with thy mouth: feede with thy worke: feede thou with praier of thy minde: with exhortation of the word, and with example of exhibition.
                  
                     Hierome seemeth to matche all Bishoppes together, as ifErasmus in his brief expositiō vpō the Epistle to Euagrius. they were all equally the Apostles successours. And he thinketh not any bishop to be lesse then other, for that he is poorer, or greater then other, or for that he is richer. For he maketh the Bishop of Eugubium equal with the Bishop of Rome. And farther, he thinketh that a bishop is no better then any priest, sauyng that the Bishop hath aucthoritie to order Ministers.

                  But although the vertue of god, hath called againe certaine soules into their bodies, for to teache vs that he might do it by his owne right: It shall not therefore bee communicated, or graunted vnto the confidence and boldenes of Magicians or Sorcerers, and vnto the deceiptefulnesse of Dreames and liynges of Poetes: but when in the examples of the resurrection,

the vertue or power of God doth bryng againe the verie soules into their bodies. It is shewed with a whole and full trueth, and which can be touched and handeled, that is a shape or forme of veritie, or that it is a true, and an vnfaigned shape or forme: so that thou maiest iudge, that all fetchyng vp, and appearyng of the dead, without bodies, is méere illusion and deceiptefulnesse.
                  The spirite of Samuell, which the woman Sorcerer raisedAugustine to Symplician. 3. question. vp to Saule, was not the soule of Samuell, but the deuill, which appeared in Samuels likenes, for to deceiue Saule.
                  
                  You ought to knowe this, that euery nation asketh counsellHierome vpon the. 8. Chap. of Ieremy. at their owne Gods, and enquireth of the dead, for the helth of the quicke: but God hath giuen you the lawe for your helpe.
                  The Soule that is departed from the bodie, can not wanderChrisostome in his. 29. Homily vpon the 8. of Math. in this countries or regions. For, the soules of the righteous are in the handes of God, and also the Soules of the children, for thei haue not synned. And that the Soules of sinners are streight wayes after their departure, led awaie, it is made manifest, by the riche man, and Lazarus.
                  But the lorde doth also saie in another place: this daie will thei fetche awaie againe thy Soule from thée. Therefore the Soule, after that it is once gone from the body, cannot wander here amonges vs, and not without a good cause, for, if they that goe in a iorney, if thei chaunce to come into some vnknowen countries, can not tell whither to goe, excepte they haue a guide: how muche more shall the soule beyng departed from the bodie, when she entereth into a life and waie that is altogether newe vnto her, be vncertaine and ignoraunt, whether she maie goe, excepte she got a guide:
                  It maie bee proued by manie places of Scripture, that the Soules of the righteous men doe not wander here after their death. For Stephen saieth: lorde receiue my spirite: and Paule did desire to be loosed, and to be with Christe. The Scripture also doth saie of the Patriarch, and he was laied to his fathers, beyng dead in good age. And that the soules of synners can not abide here, neither heare the riche what he saieth, marke and

weigh what he doeth aske and not obteine. If the Soules of men might be conuersante here, he would haue come hymsef, as his desire was, and certifie his brethren of the tormentes of Hell.
                  By the which place of the Scripture, this is also most manifest and plaine, that the soules, after the be gone out of their bodies, are ledde into a certaine place, from whence thei come not againe at their owne will and pleasure, but do tarie there for the dreadfull daie of iudgement.
                  How shall thei perswade mée, or make mée to beléeue that the soules of vnspotted men, dooe woorke with them? shall it be, bicause that thou hast some times harde theim, that be possessed with deuilles, crie out and saie, I am the soule of suche a one? but this saiyng doth also procéede and come of the fraude and deceiptefulnes of the Deuill. For, it is not the soule of the head that speaketh suche thynges: but the Deuill doeth faine and counterfaict them, that he may deceiue and beguile them that heare.
                  These ought to be taken as olde wiues Fables, the words ofliers, and fraie bugges of children: neither can the soule, beyng departed from the bodie, walke in the earth.
                  That thou maiest also aboundantly and fully knowe that
                        In his. 4. Sermon of Diues and Lazarus. the doctrine of the scriptures, and of the Prophets, is of more weight and aucthoritie, than if thei that be raised againe from death, shoulde shewe any thyng: consider this with thy selfe, that whosoeuer is dead, is a seruaunt: but whatsoeuer the scripture doeth speake, the lorde hath spoken it. Therfore though a dead man should rise againe, or an Angel come downe from heauen: wee muste chiefly and aboue all thynges beléeue the Scriptures. For, the maister of the Angels, and the Lorde, both of the liuyng and of the dead, hath made them.
                  And if god had knowen that the dead, beyng raised againe▪ might haue profited the liuyng: he that hath doen all thynges for our profite, woulde not haue left the same vndoone. And if it were, that the dead should often tymes rise againe, men would also despise the same, and set naught by it nowe adaies.
                  Lette vs not seeke to heare those of the dead, that the holy

Scriptures doe teache vs most plainely, least by the processe of tyme, the deuill should haue set forth pernitious doctrines, and also least the worde of God, shoulde haue come into contempte. For in stéede of good spirites, the Deuill woulde haue appeared for euery trifle vnto men, and woulde haue trasformed hymselfe into the soules departed: for to bryng euerie daie newe reuelations, or he should haue made as though he had raised some of the dead by false and deceiptfull iullusions, or he should haue turned awaie some men from the true faith, whiche would haue made folke to beléeue, that they had béene dead and raised vp againe, and so he woulde haue made them to saie, whatsoeuer it had pleased hym.
                  Wherby it should haue come to passe, that the holy Scriptures shoulde haue béen vtterly despised, and that men would onely haue giuen credit to fuche reuelatious as we doe see by experience now at this daie And so men could not haue deserned or knowen the true reuelations of God, from the reuelations of the Deuill.
                  And therfore, God would not teache vs by the dead, but by his holy Scriptures, and by the ministerie of liuyng men: of whom also he had vs to beware, that thei doo not set forth vnto vs one thyng for an other, and deceiue vs.

haue then a commaundement to withdrawe our selues from dreames: but these thinges are pleasaunt and acceptable vnto theim that serue Deuilles, and seeme vnto theim both greate and worthy to be obserued with all diligence.
                  It is moste certaine, that when thei gaue themselues to serue Deuilles, then thei did sléepe in the Graues, and wente after dreames, and southsaiyng, behauyng themselues after the maner of Sorcerers.

                     Theophilacte vpon the. 16. of Luke. There be suche now a daies, which are wonte to saie: who hath séene what is doen in Hell? who euer came to bring vs worde? But let theim heare what Abraham saieth: For if we doo not beleeue the scriptures, we would not beléeue them, neither that should come frō hell. The Iewes haue wel declared the same: which bicause that thei beléeued not the Scriptures, would in no wise beleeue them that were raised againe from the dead: but woulde haue slaine Lazarus, that was raised againe. And although many were raised againe from death, after that Christe was crucified: yet did thei not let therfore to persecute most cruelly the Apostles afterwarde.
                  We must not then séeke after the dead, for to haue instruction by them. For, first and foremost, God doth not by death separate the soule from the bodie, for to suffre the spirites and soules of the dead to wander here vpon earth: but he maketh this separation for to satisfie vnto his ordinaunce, wherby he hath ordeined and appointed, that this earthly bodie, which is of earth and dust, should returne into the earth, and into the dust wherof it was taken, and that it should rest in the same, as in his bedde, vntill that daie, that he shall make it to rise againe, and that he shall fashion and shapen it a newe, by the resurrection and glorifiyng of the same, whiche he hath promised vnto it: for as he hath formed and fashioned it by creation: so hath he determined to shapen it againe by resurrection.
                  And as he hath appointed of the bodie, so hath he ordeined, that the soule and the spirite that he hath giuen vnto man, and whiche is partaker of a spirituall substaunce, shoulde returne

vnto hym that hath giuen it, and that it should goe vp againe vnto the place, that is conuenient and meete for his nature: As the bodie goeth downe vnto the place that it is partaker of.
                  Bicause of his nature and weight, vntill the Lorde do come againe, to vnite the soule with the bodie. And as a man might saie, to ioyne heauen with earth, that is to say, the deuine and heauenly parte, with the humaine and earthly parte, by the resurrection, whiche is a newe regeneration, and as it were a seconde creation: as he did in the beginnyng, by the first creation, when he did ioyne the soule, whiche is a spirituall substaunce, with the bodie that is made of earth.
                  If it had been profitable for the faith, that the dead had oftentymes appeared vnto the liuyng, the Lorde woulde haue doen it often. But nowe there is nothyng so profitable, as the diligent searchyng out of the scriptures. The Deuill can also counterfaict falsely and in out warde apperaunce, the resurrection of the dead, for to seduce and deceiue the ignoraunte and foolishe, and for to sowe pernitious and deuillishe doctrines accordyng to his malice.
                  But thei can haue no illusions that searche the scriptures, as it behoueth, for thei be the Candle, whiche if it shineth and giue light once, the thief is taken and manifested. We muste then beleeue the Scriptures, and not care for the raisyng, or wandryng vp againe of the dead soules.

If thou wilte knowe, how it ought not to seeme to thee a newe thing, and impossible, that earthly and corruptible thinges, be tourned into the substaunce of Christe, looke vpon thy self, whiche art made newe in Baptisme, when thou wast farre from life, and banished from mercie as a straunger, and from the waie of saluation, and inwardly was deade, yet sodainly thou beganst an other life in Christe, and wast made newe by wholsome misteries, thou visibly diddeste remaine in the same measure, that thou haddest before, but inuisiblie thou wast made greater, without any increase of the bodie: thou wast the selfe same persone, and yet by the increase of faithe, thou wast made an other man: outwardly nothyng was added, but all the chaunge was inwardly. So likewise when thou doest goe vp to the reuerent Table, to feede vpon spirituall meates, in thy faithe, looke vpon the bodie and bloud of hym that is thy GOD: honour hym, touche hym, with thy mynde: take hym in thy hande of thy harte: and chiefly drinke hym, with the draught of thy inwarde man.

Nor there is no woorde founde here, to proue that there is the true presence of Christes fleshe, & bloud in our Masse: for albeit that Christe made his fleshe of bread, and bloud of wine, it foloweth not therefore, that we shall also doe the same, as often as we will attempte it, by the vertue of any worde that is there.
                  It cannot therefore be proued by any scripture, that either a laye man, or a priest, as often as he shall goe about that matter, to make likewise breade, and wine, the bodie and bloud of Christe, as Christe hym self did, seyng that this is not comprised, nor contained in the scriptures.
                  By this I thinke, euery man vnderstandeth, that the certaintie of this matter, dependeth not so muche vpon the Gospell, as it doeth vpon the vse and custome, whiche is recommended vnto vs in so many hundred yeres, from the very first fathers.

                  Seldome is any difficultie in proper woordes: But either the circumstaunce of the place, or the conferryng of diuerse translations, or els the original tongue, wherein it was written, will make the sence plaine: But in woordes that bée altered from their proper signification, there is greate diligence, and heede to bee taken. And especially we muste beware, that

wee take not literally any thyng that is spoken figuratiuely: nor contrarywise, wee muste not take for a figure, any thyng that is spoken properly. Therefore must bée declared the maner, how to descerne a proper speache, frō a figuratiue, wherin must be obserued this rule.
                  If the thyng whiche is spoken, bee to the furtheraunce of charitie, then it is a proper speache, and no figure. So that if it bee a commaundemente, that forbiddeth any euill or wicked thyng, or commaundeth any thyng that is good, or beneficiall, then it is no figure: But if it commaunde any euill, or wicked thyng, or forbiddeth any thyng that is good and beneficiall, then it is a figuratiue speache. Now this saiyng of Christe (except ye eate the fleshe of the sonne man, and drinke his bloud, you shall haue no life in you) seemeth to cōmaunde an hainouls and a wicked thyng, therefore it is a figure, commaundyng vs to be partakers of Christes passion, keepyng in our myndes, in our greate comforte and profite, that his fleshe was crucified, and wounded for vs.

These thynges brethren, are therefore called Sacramentes, bicause that in them, one thyng is séene, and an other

thyng vnderstanded. That whiche is séene, hath a visible appearaunce or forme: But that whiche is vnderstanded hath a spirituall vtilitie and profite.

                  Likewise, vpon Easter daie we saie, this daie Christe rose from death: where in very deede, it is many hundred yeres sithens he rose frō death: Why then, doe not men reprooue vs as lyars, when wée speake in this sorte? But bicause wee call these daies so, by a similitude of those daies, wherin those thinges were doen in deede. And so it is called that daie, whiche is not that daie in deede: but by the course of the yere, it is a like daie. And suche thynges bée saied to bée doen that daie, for the solemne celebration of the Sacramentes, whiche thynges in déede were not doen that daie, but long before. Was christ offered any more but once? And he offered hym self: And yet in a sacrament or representation, not onely euery solemne feast, of Easter: but euery daie he is offered to the people, so that he doeth not lye, that saieth, he is euery daie offered.
                  For if Sacramentes, had not some similitude, or likenesse of those thynges, whereof thei be Sacramentes: and for their similitude and likenesse, commonly thei haue the name of the thynges, whereof thei be Sacramentes. Therefore, as after a certaine maner of speache, the Sacramente of Christes bodie, is Christes bodie: the Sacramente of Christes bloud, is Christes bloud: So likewise the Sacrament of faithe, is faith: And therefore, when we aunswere for yong children in their Baptisme, that thei beleue, whiche haue not yet the minde to beleue, wée aunswere, that thei haue faithe, bicause thei haue the Sacramente of faithe. And wee saie also that thei tourne vnto God, bicause of the Sacrament of conuersion vnto God: for the aunswere pertaineth to the celebration of the Sacramente.
                  And likewise speaketh the Apostle, of Baptisme, saiyng: that by Baptisme we be buried with hym into death, he saith

not, that we signifie buriall: But he saieth plainly, that we be buried. So that the Sacramente of so greate a thyng, is not called: but by the name of thyng it self.In his. 57. question. vpon Leuiticus.

And so said S. Paule. that the rocke was Christ, and not that it signified Christ: but euen as it had been in deede: whiche neuerthelesse, was not Christe, by substaunce: But by signification. Euen so, bicause the bloud signifieth and representeth the soule, therefore, in a Sacramente, or signification, it is called the soule.In his booke against Adimantus the 12. Chap.

And the sinner beyng conuerted, receiuyng the holy Misteries of the Lordes Supper, giueth thankes vnto God, and boweth doune his head, knowyng that his synnes bee forgiuen, and that he is made cleane and perfecte, and his soule (whiche God hath sanctified) he rendereth to God again as a faithfull pledge, and then he glorieth with Paule, saiyng, now it is not I that liue: but it is Christe that liueth in me.

Chap. of the Citie of God. their mouthes, and in their liuyng shewe the contrary, haue neither a true faithe (whiche woorketh by charitie, and doeth not euill) are to be coumpted among the members of Christe. For thei can not be, bothe members of Christ, and members of the deuill. Therefore it maie not be saied, that any of them eate the body of Christe. For when Christe saieth, he that eateth my fleshe, and drinketh my bloud, dwelleth in me, and I in hym. He sheweth what it is, to eate his bodie, and drinke his bloud: whiche is, when a man dwelleth so in Christe, that Christe dwelleth in hym. For Christe spake those woordes, as if he should saie: he that dwelleth not in me, and in whom I dwell not, let hym not saie or thinke, that he eateth my bodie,

or drinke my bloud.
                  He that dooeth not eate his fleshe, and drinke his bloud,In his. 26. treatise vpon Iohn. hath not in hym euerlastyng life. And he that eateth his fleshe and drinketh his bloud, hath euerlastyng life: but it is not so iu those meates, which then we take to sustaine our bodies. For, although without them we cannot liue, yet, it is not necessarie, that whosoeuer receiueth theim, shall liue, for thei maie dye for age, sickenesse, or otherwaies.
                  But in this meate and drinke of the bodie and bloud of our Lorde, it is other wise, for bothe thei that eate and drinke theim not, haue not euerlastyng life, and contrarywise, who so euer eate and drinke, thei haue euerlastyng life.
                  The Sacrament of the vnitie of Christes body and bloud, is taken in the Lordes table, of some men to life, and of some men to death: but the thyng it self is taken of all men to life, and of no man to death. This is to eate that meate, and drinke that drinke: to dwell in Christe, and to haue Christe dwell in hym. And for that cause, he that dwelleth not in Christ, and in whom Christe dwelleth not, without doubt he eateth not spiritually his flesh, nor drinke his bloud: although carnally and visibly with his teeth, he bite the Sacrament of his bodie and bloud.

The solemnitie of the woordes, and the inuocation of Gods holy name, and the outward signes appoincted by the ministerie of the priest, by the institution of the Apostles, woorke the visible outwarde Sacramente: but touchyng the substaunce thereof, it is the holy ghost, that woorketh it.

                  For like as when hee was conuersante here in earth as a man, yet then he filled heauen, and did not leaue the companie of Angels: Euen so beyng now in heauen with his fleshe, yet he filleth the earth, and is in them that loue hym. And it is to

be marked, that although Christe should goe awaie onely as concernyng his fleshe (for he is euer present in the power of his diuinity) yet for a little time he saide he would be with his disciples.

                  If the nature of the Godhead were a body, it must néedes be in a place, and haue quantitie, greatnes, and circumscription.
                  Christ could not be conuersant with his Apostles in fleshe,In his. xi. boke and iii. chap. vpon Iohn. Didimus in his. i. boke and i. chap of the holie Ghoste. after that he had ascended vnto his father.
                  All creatures, visible and inuisible, bee circumscribed and inuironed either within one place, or within the propertie of their owne substaunce: so that no Angell can be at one tyme in twoo places: And for as muche as the holy ghoste, is in many men at one time, therfore the holy ghost must needes be God.
                  One and the self Christe, of mankinde, was made a man,Fulgentius in his v. booke to Kyng Thrasimundus. compassed in a place, who of his father is God, without measure or place, one and the self same persone. As concernyng his mans substaunce was not in heauen, when he was in earth, and forsooke the earth, when he ascended into heauen: But as concernng his godly substaunce (which is aboue all measure) he neither left heauen, when he came from heauen, nor he left not the earth, when he ascended into heauen, whiche maie bee knowen by the moste certaine woorde of Christe hym self: who, to shewe the placyng of his humanitie, saied to his disciples, I ascende vp to my father, and your father, to my God, and your God. Also when he had saied of Lazarus, that he was dead, he added, saiyng: I am glad for your sakes, that you maie beleue, that I was not there: but to shewe the vnmeasurable compasse of his diuinitie, he saied to his disciples: Beholde, I am with you alwaies, vnto the worldes ende.
                  Nowe, how did he goe vp into heauen: but bicause he is a very man, cōteined within a place? Or how is he present with faithfull people: but bicause he is very GOD, beyng without measure.
                  
                     Vigil. in his i. boke against Eutiches. Christe saied to his disciples: if you loued me, you would

be glad, for I goe vnto my father. And again he saied: It is expedient for you that I goe, for if I goe not, the comforter shall not come to you: and yet surely, the eternall worde of God, the vertue of God, the wisedome of God, was euer with his father, and in his father: yea, euen at the same tyme when he was with vs, and in vs. For, when he did mercifully dwell in this worlde, he left not his habitation in heauen, for he is euery where whole with his father, equall in diuinitie, whom no place can containe, for the sonne filleth all thynges, and there is no place, that lacketh the presence of his diuinitie.
                  From whence then, and whither did he saie, that he would goe? Or how did he saie, that he went to his father, frō whom doubtlesse he neuer departed? But that, to goe to his father, and from vs, was taken from this worlde that nature, whiche he receiued of vs. Thou séest therefore, that it was the propertie of that nature, to bée taken awaie, and goe from vs, whiche in the ende of the worlde, shall be rendered againe to vs, as the Angels witnessed, saiyng: This Iesus, whiche is taken from you, shall come again, like as you sawe him goyng vp into heauen. For looke vnto the miracle, looke vpon the misterie of bothe the natures. The sonne of God, as concernyng his humanitie, wente from vs, as concernyng his diuinitie, he saied vnto vs: Beholde, I am with you all the daies, vnto the worldes ende.
                  He is with vs, and not with vs, for those whom he left and went from, as concernyng his humanitie: Those he lefte not, nor forsooke theim not, as touchyng his diuinitie: For as touchyng the forme of a seruaunte (whiche he tooke awaie from vs into heauen) he is absent from vs: But by the forme of God (which goeth not from vs,) he is present with vs in earth, and neuerthelesse, bothe present and absent, he is all one Christe.
                  If the woorde and thè fleshe, were bothe of one nature, seyng that the worde is euerywhere, why is not the fleshe then euery where? For when it was in earth, then verely it was not in heauen. And now when it is in heauen, it is not surely in earth. And it is so sure, that it is not in earth, that as concernyng it, we looke for hym to come from heauen, when as concernyng

his eternall worde, we beleue to be with vs in earth: Therefore by your doctrine, either the woorde is conteined in a place with his fleshe, or els the fleshe is euery where with the woorde. For, one nature cannot receiue in it self, twoo diuers and contrary thynges: but these twoo thynges, be diuers and farre vnlike, that is to saie, to bee contained in a place, and to bee euery where. Therefore, in as muche as the woorde is euery where, and the fleshe is not euery where, it appeareth plainly▪ that one Christe hymself, hath in hym twoo natures: And that by his diuine nature, he is euery where: And by his humaine nature, hee is contained in a place. That he is created: and hath no beginning: that he is subiecte to death, and can not dye. Wherof, one he hath by nature of his worde, (wherby he is God) and the other he hath by the nature of his fleshe, wherby the same God is man also.
                  Therefore one sonne of God, the selfe same was made the sonne of man, and he hath a beginnyng, by the nature of his fleshe: And no beginnyng by the nature of his Godhead: he is created by the nature of his fleshe: not created by the nature of his godhead: he is comprehended in a place, by the nature of his flesh: And not cōprehended in a place, by the nature of his Godhead. He is inferiour to Angels in the nature of his fleshe: And equall to his father in the nature of his Godhead. He died by the nature of his fleshe: And died not by the nature of his Godhead.
                  This is the faithe and catholique confession, whiche the Apostles taught, the Martyrs haue confirmed, and the faithfull keepe vnto this daie.Theodoret in in his. ii. dialogue.
                  
                  The body of Christe, therefore did rise againe, quit Cleane from all corruption and death, and is impossible, immortall, glorified with the glorie of god, and is honoured of the powers of heauen, and yet is a bodie, and the same bignesse, that it had before.
                  To sit in the Throne of glorie, and to set his Lambes vpon his right hande, and the Goates vpon the left hand, signifieth a thyng that hath quantitie and bignesse.
                  Christes body hath his former fashion, figure, and bignesse,

and to speake at one worde, the same substaunce of his bodie.Gregorie in his xxi. Homilie vpon Easter daie.
                  
                  He is risen, he is not here: christ is not here by the presence of his fleshe: And yet he is absent no where by the presence of his diuine maiestie.Gregorie Nazyanzene against Apollinarius.
                  
                  Christe, accordyng to his bodie, is within the limitation of place: accordyng to his spirite and Godhead, he is without the limitation of any place.

And so he aduised the Counsaill, that thei should not make any suche lawe, assuring them, that the matter was greate, and might bee an occasion of fornication, either vnto them, or vnto their wiues. And thus Paphuntius did set for the the matter (all bée it he were vnmaried hym self.)

I will not speake now of Peter, whiche was married, and Philippe the Deacon. Belike the Churche of Christe was in greate blindenesse, which then could not spie, that the misterie of the aulter should not bee committed vnto married men, what thinketh and iudgeth that Counsaill, whiche pronounceth them accursed, which refused to be at the Communion of a Priest, which hath a wife.

And for the moste parte, thei left all their labours, and the fruict that should come of them, bicause their teachyng is despised, and set at naught, for their shamefull liuynges.
                  There is nothyng more to bee desired, then that a Priest might liue frée from marriage, and might wholy serue the lorde: but after that he hath assaied all remedies, and is neuer the better, and the rebellion of the fleshe cannot be ouercommed, this then is nexte to be doen, lette hym liue chastly with one, not for pleasure: but for a remedie, hauyng his wife alwaies, endeuouring him self with all his power, that he which hath a wise graunted hym, fill vp and recompence the weakenesse of the fleshe, with other good liuing beside, and with holy study, for by this meanes euery man shall knowe, that he hath taken a wife for neede, and not for pleasure.
                  And I doubte not: but there is many Bishops, whiche perceiueth that it is euen so as we saie: but here I am afraied, that lucre and aduantage stoppe vs, that we followe not it whiche we knowe is beste.

                  He is worse then a Iewe, for one Iewe will not take vsurie of an other: but the Usurer will take vsurie of his Christian brethren.
