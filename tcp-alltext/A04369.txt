                     Iohn. 9.11.17. that Christ and his Apostles did preach, and pronounce vnto and agaynst them, yet we are taughte by the holy Ghost, to abhorre them, their examples, and the like examples, by whom soeuer they be shewed, much more, the examples of those Antechristes which are now the mockers of God, and euen now do sit, not in the chayre of Moyses, but in the chayre of pestylence,

                     ezech. 10. Ihon. 17. 1. Pet. 1. Psal. 144 Rom 11. He doth graunt and it is his almightines moste holy wyll, that if it chaunce that any such parson or parsons, so in tharticle of death, do not dye at that instant time wherein they so called them selues to their duties, that for their so pure hartes and mindes towardes him, they shall not onely inioy, thabsolution aforesayd, but also for euer after during life, be continued in the same with health of body and soule,

in this world, and in ye world to come life euerlasting, for God our holy Father is not onely so redy to pardone, at the hower or article of death, but also at euery hower whensoeuer his seruants will call vpon him with a penitent and pure hart.
               Item, to all those which by vsurping vsury, by vnsaciable gayne, in buying and selling, by fraudulent deuises, or any other vnlawful meanes, haue obteined and gotten into their handes, the goods and riches of this world, if those vsurping vsurors, insaciable gayners, fraudulent deuisors, and vnlawfull doers, (being abhomynable sinners) doe from the bottom of their hartes repent for the same, and professe in their lyues and doctryne amendment of life, and doe seeke to make some restitution, eyther by rendring back againe, or reconsiliation, to them which they haue so hindred, he doth graunt vnto them that they shall rest in his tabernacle, and dwel in his holy hill, for S.

                  The first Table.
                  
                     HArken,
                        exod. 20. Deut. 5. O Israell, I am the lord thy God, which haue brought thée out of the lande of Egipt and out of the house of bondage.
               
               
                  
                  The first Commaundement.
                  
                     Thou shalt haue none other gods but mee.
                  
                  THere is no more gods but one, in whome it is very hard for vs to put our trust onely in, not for that he is vntrusty, but bicause we are so corruptible in our fleshe, that of our selues we cannot but geue credit vnto vanity, for whosoeuer putrech his trust many thīg maketh, a strange god of the same that he putteth his truste in, so that a man

                     , it is necessary to haue a constant faith, and confidence in God, that is, a perfect loue, feare, reuerence, and hope, and to let all our trust depend onely vppon him, the which is, to worship him in spirit and truth, & this commaundemēt

is a fountaine from whēce doeth spring the whole Lawe, and the obseruance thereof.
               
               
                  The second Commaundement.
                  
                     ¶Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any grauen Image,
                        Deut. 4. Psal. 80. leuit. 26. esay. 41. actes. 17. Rom. 1. Iosue 24. nor the likenes of any thing that is in heauen aboue or in the earth beneath, or in the water vnder the earth, thou shalt not bowe downe to them nor worship them, for I the Lord thy God am a gellous god, and visit the sinne of the fathers vppon their children, vnto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and shew mercy vnto thousandes of them that loue me and keepe my commaundements.
                  
                  BEcause God is a spirite, he doth forbid vs heare to represent him in the likenes of any corporal or bodily thing, as though he were in it, or like it, wherfore those that will worshippe visible thinges, and maintaine the same, contrary

to the worde of God, are threatned here as Idolatoures and breakers of the lawe, because the honoure which they doe owe vnto God, they doe vse it vnto his creatures.
               
               
                  The third commaundement.

                  HE doth commaunde that with our tongue we should testefy that wee haue a God almighty, whome wee ought to feare, to reuerence, and to loue, and not to sweare by his name in any light thing, nor by his creatures to couer a lie, but if we doe sweare, we must doe it to his glory, our saluation, and the helpe of our neighebors in good thinges, and then must we sweare onelie by the name of the liuinge god.
               
               
                  The fourth commaundement
                  
                     
                        Deut. 5. ezech 20 genes. 1.2¶ Remember thou kepe holy the Saboth day, Sixe dayes shalte thou labor and doe all that thou hast to doe, but the

seuenth day is the Saboth of the Lorde thy God,

Heb. 4. in it thou shalte doe no maner of worcke, thou nor thy sonn, nor thy daughter, nor thy manseruant, nor thy mayd seruaunte, nor thy cattel, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates, for in Sixe dayes the Lorde made heauen and yearth the Sea and al that is therin, and rested the seuenth day, wherefore the Lorde blessed the Seuenth day and hallowed it.
                  
                  The ceremony of keping of the saboth day, did finishe and ende with the cerymonies and shaddowe of the lawe, by the death of Iesus Christ, but the substaunce therof doth remain to this day, and perpetually, that is, to kepe the saboth spiritually, to cease from labour & worldly worke, that god may worke in vs, and that in al thinges that wee do, we geue him ye glory, god graunt we may seeke the same for euer.

                     It is commaunded vnto vs by this commaundement, that wee reuerence and honoure our carnall fathers, euery one in his place, that is to say, our superiors in eache estate and degree, from the lowest to the highest, and so backe againe, to helpe them in necessitie according to our habilities, to honour, reuerence, and obey them, for that they are called to theyr places by god, & to draw vs vnto it, to doe it according to hys word, he doth incite and incourage vs, by a chearfull and comfortable promise, and that is, our dayes shalbe enlarged, and we haue long lyfe, the which is fulfilled, in them that please god.

                  We are not by this precept or commaundement onely forbidden to kill or doe any murther, and ye interior causes of the same, but also he doth commaund a vertue cleane to the contrary▪ and that is, to loue our neighbors as our selues, and so to doe them good, as we woulde be done vnto, yea euen to the sauegarde of their lyues, if neede bee, by all the

meanes that we possibly can deuise.

                  THis precept or commaundemente, doth commaund vs not to steal, and therein establisheth the possession of any thing that is righteousely gotten, and doth also put vs in minde of the brotherly loue which we ought to haue towardes our neighboures, and so one to an other with all humility.
               
               
                  The ninth commaundement.
