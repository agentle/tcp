            ¶The Prologe vnto the Chriſten Reader.
            HEre haſt thou Chriſten Reader the ſentences and iudgementes of the excellent and godlye lernyd men / Henry Bullynger / wyth all the lerned men of the church of Tygury / and alſo the ſentence and iudgement of Ihon Caluyne of Geneua / Whether a Chriſten man may lawfully cōmunycate or be pertaker with the Maſſe and ceremonyes of the Papyſtes / without offendyng God and hys neyghboure or not. Therfore haue I ſet forth this epiſtle of thoſe godly and lernyd men / to the intent that thou mayeſt the better knowe what ydolatrye is / and wherin it conſiſteth / wherby alſo thou mayſt the better lerne and knowe how to auoyde it: Conſyderinge that it is the greateſt offence that may be commytted a gaynſt God. For it is forbydden in the fyrſt commaundemēt / ſayenge: Thou ſhalt haue no nother goddes but me. Alſo all the holy Prophetes of God euer cryed out thervpon. And agayne it is manyfeſt thorow the hole Byble how greuouſe a ſynne it is / by the greuouſnes of the plages with the which God euer plagyd the children of Iſrael therfore. But here ſome wyll anſwere and ſaye: We know that ydolatrye is a greuouſe ſynne / and ſore dyſpleaſeth God: But wyll yow ſaye that the holy Maſſe and Ceremonyes that haue bene vſed in the church thys many hundryd yeares / and alſo ſet vp by holy counſayles be wycked / and that men commytte ydolatrye by vſyng of them?Deut. xij. Deut. iiij Deut. v To that I anſwere that what ſo euer lawe or Ceremonye / the church hath made or ſet vp / & the ſame not expreſſed in the worde of God / it owght not to be alowed / folowed / nor kept: For God commaunded the chyldren of Iſrael / Deuter. xij. that they ſhoulde not do euery man what thynketh hym good in his own eyes? And agayne Deuter .iiij. Ye ſhall put no thinge to the worde of God / nor take no thinge therfrom. And agayne in the .v. chap. of the ſame boke. Take hede therfore that yow do as the Lorde your God hath commaundyd you: and tourne not aſyde / nether to the ryght hande nor to the lyfte: but walke in all the wayes which the Lorde thy God commaundyd the. &c. Now wher can it be founde in any worde of God / the inuencyon of the Papiſtes Maſſes / or that ymages ought to be in churches / or ſoch lyke. Parauēture thou wilt anſwere me that they were ordeyned and ſet vp for a good intēt and purpoſe.Leui. x Therto I anſwere / that Nadab & Abihu the ſonnes of Aaron

were conſumeth wyth the fyre / as appeteth Leui. 
                  •
                for offring ſtraūge fyre before the Lorde / that the Lorde cōmaunded thē not. Therfore whatſoeuer is inuentyd by the fantaſye of mans ymaginaciō without the worde of God / we ought not to conſent to do it:Galat. i. For ſ. Paul ſayeth to the Galathiās. Yf we oure ſelues or an angell of heauē come / & preache an other goſpell vnto you / then that we haue preached / holde him acurſyd. And although the maſſe a ceremonyes haue a gloryous ſhyne of holynes / yet owght we not therfore, the leſſe abhorre it / ſeing Chriſt ſayeth Mat. xv.Matt. xv. They worſhyp me in vayne / teaching doctrynes & tradycyōs of men. Alſo Chriſt ſayeth Luk. xvi.Luke. xvi That whych is in high eſtimacyō before men / is abhomynable before God: Signyfyeng therby vnto vs that the moſt gloryous workes & ceremonyes / that be had in moſt hygh eſtimacyō before the worlde / yf the ſame be not agreinge to the moſt holy worde of God / they be abhomynable & very folyſhnes before God. &c.i. Cori. ii
                     •
                  
                And wher as oure mercy full ſaueyoure Chriſt ordeyned his holy Sacrament of his body & bloude: not to be worſhypped / but to the intēt that all that are ſtōge in the cōſciēce with ſynne / ſhuld come & ſeke helpe only in hym / the whych is the onely helper of all that call vpon him / as ſ. Peter ſayeth: ther is no helth in any other / nether is ther any other name geuen vnto men wherby they ſhalbe ſauyd.Act. iiij. Antichriſt with his diſciples haue peruertyd it / cleane from the vſe that owre Sauyoure dyd inſtytute it / lyke as the chyldrē of Iſrael alſo dyd peruert the vſe of the braſen ſerpent / that God commandyd Moſes to make and to hange vp in the wyldernes / to the intēt only / that they that were ſtōge with the fyrye ſerpētes myght be healyd only by beholdynge the ſerpent of braſſe that Moſes had hangyd vp:Numr xx
                     •
                  
                The which braſen ſerpent dyſcrybyd lyuely the hangyng vp of Chriſt vpō the croſſe / as apperyth Iohn .iij. to the intēt that none that beleue in hym ſhould peryſhe / but haue lyffe euerlaſtyng. Wherfore lyke as the good kynge Ezechias brake down the ſerpent of braſſe / becauſe the chyldren of Iſrael dyd cō
               myt ydolatrye / & worſhypped it / contrarye to the vſe that it was ſet vp for.Iohn. iij. Euen ſo thankes & prayſe be vnto God hath other Kynges and Princes in this dayes in other cōtres / cauſyd the Maſſe of the papyſtes to be abolyſſhed & to be no more vſyd nor ſayd / becauſe that therin the people cōmytted ydolatrye by worſhyhping the bread / lyke as the chyldren of Iſrael cōmytted ydolatrye with worſhipping the braſen ſerpēt. Nether is

it any other thinge then ydolatrye to beleue that a vyſyble ceremonye of it ſelffe is a ſeruyce to the inuyſyble God / whoſe ſeruyce is ſpirituall as he is a ſpryte / and therfore wylbe worſhypped in ſpryte and treuth. Iohn. iiij.Iohn. iiij.
               Roma. vi Therfore do I exhorte the Chryſten Reader / whatſoeuer thou be that ſhall reade this epiſtles of thes godlye lernyd men / that thou wilt folowe ſ. Paules cōſayle / wher he ſayeth: As ye haue geuē your mē
               bers ſeruauntes to vncleanes & wyckednes / runnyng out of one wickednes into another:i. Corin. x ij. Cor. vi Euen ſo now geue your members to ſerue ryghtuouſnes. And remēber al ſo that they that eate of the ſacryfyce are pertakers of the altare. And conſyder what a godlye leſſon ſ. Paul geueth his Corinthiās in the ſecond epiſtle the .vi. cha. ſayeng: Beare not the yocke with the vnbeleuers: for what felowſhyp hath righteouſnes with vnrighteouſnes / what cōpany hath lyght with darknes / what cō

Cor. vij
               i. Corin. x For as much as we haue ſuch promyſes derely beloued / let vs clenſe oure ſelues from all filthynes of the fleſhe and ſpyryte / & grow vp to full holynes in the feare of God. Wherfore derely beloued / fle from the worſhippinge of ydoles / leaſt by thyne euell example thou confirme the weake brother in his erroure / & ſo thy weake brother peryſhe for whom Chriſt dyed / and ſo will God requier his bloude of thy hande:i. Cor. viij wherfore I hartely requyre the Chriſten reader / that thou wilt diligently reade the .iij. chap. of Daniel / & marke how Sydrack / Myſach & Abdenago / the whych were great rulers / dyd rather choſe to be caſt in the kote brēning ouen / then they wolde outwardly bowe them ſelues to the ymage that the Kyng hath ſet vp.Dani. iij.
               Matth. v. Therfore Chriſtē Reader do I the exhorte yet once agayne / that thou wilt put thy thruſt onely in the lyuynge God / & beleue ſtedfaſtly in thyne hart / that he is able & will fulfyll all his good promyſes / that he hath promyſed / & that heauen and earth ſhal paſſe / but one tote or tytle of the lawe ſhall not paſſe / tyll all be fulfylled.i. Corin. x And he hath promyſed / that he will not ſuffer his to be tēpted aboue

their ſtrength: but will in the middes of the temptacyon make a waye to eſcape out. That is / yf thou put thy hole truſt onely in hym / ſeking onely his glorye & prayſe in all that thou goeſt about / he wyll (I ſaye) accordyng to his acuſtomable mercyes delyuer the: ether by blyndynge the eyes of thyne aduerſaryes / that they ſhall take no hede of the:Dani. i. or els geue the fauour in the ſyght of them as he gaue Danyel with the .iij. yonge men fauour in the ſight of the keper / whē they were in captyuyte / becauſe they had determyned with thē ſelfes to kepe thē vndefiled.Tobi. i And alſo gaue Tobias fauour in the ſight of the Kyng Salmanaſer / with many other / as Ioſeph / Ieremy. & c: Or elles yf they eſpye the / he ſhall geue the ſtrength to glorifye his name by ſuffryng for his truth / as he hath done many holy Prophetes / Apoſtles & martyrs / whoſe hope and truſt was onely in the reſurreccyō. And for that cauſe the mother with her .vij. ſonnes dyd choſe to ſuffer cruell tormentes & martyrdome / rather then they wold eate ſwynes fleſh that was forbydden in the lawe / not fearyng the tyrauntes that coulde do no more but kyll the bodye / beleuynge and ſayenge that God wold rayſe them vp agayne / which dye for his lawes in the reſurreccyō of euerlaſtynge lyfe.ij. Mach. vij. And alſo note the conſtancye of olde Elcazare / the which rather then he wold but make a countynaūce as though he wolde haue eaten of ſuch meates as were forbiddē in the lawe / dyd rather choſe to ſuffer the moſt cruell death / as appereth in the ſecōd boke of Machabees in the .vj. Chapter / the which yf thou do marke with a ſyngle eye / I put no dowbt but thou ſhalt eaſely perceyue how greatlye all maner outwarde ſymulacyon of wyckednes doth diſpleaſe God / and therfore alſo how greately euery Chriſten man ought to abhorre it.ij. Mach. vij.
            
            Thus I commyt the Chriſten reader to the defence & kepyng of the moſt hygh God / whych dwellyth not in temples made wyth hādes / nether is woſhypped with mens inuencyons / but whoſe ſeate is the heauens / and the earth his fote ſtole / as ſayth the prophet / that with the breth of his mouth ſhall dyſtroye all antychryſtes with all ther venemus lawes that hath coriupt & poyſonyd the precyos ſoule of man.Act. vij.

            Here folowyth the Epyſtle of Henry Sullengers.
            IT is ſhewed vs worſhipfull brother Hermā ne / by the excelēt & ryght godly man mayſter Iohn Beckſtayne / that ther goeth abrode a certayne epyſtle from one to a nother amonge the congregaciōs of lowe dowchlande / wherin it is playnely taught to be lefull for Chriſten men to goe to hyghe maſſe as they call it. And that becauſe of this epyſtle ſome be greatlye trobled in conſcyence / & other ſome coniecture all the myniſters of the congregacions of highe dowchland to be of the ſame iudgement. Wherfore we of the church of Tigurye thowght it good to purge the old & true fayth & lernynge whych we hold / from this vnhappye ſuſpicion / openly confeſſing vnto you (a miniſter by the grace of God / in the congregacions of lowe Germanye / both of good lernynge & conuerſacyon) that we nether be our ſelues of that mynde / nor yet alowe that ſentence. As for thynges which be callyd meane & indifferent / we beleue a chriſten mā may vſe them in all tymes & places without ſcrupuloſyte of conſcience / ſo that all thynge be done diſcreatlye / & accordyng to charite. That is to ſaye / to the glorye of God & the edifyeng of our neyghboures / & the hole congregation. But the popes maſſe / be it hygh or lowe / ymages / & other lyke / which be expreſſelye againſt the worde of God / & the pure fayth / we reckē not amō
               ge indifferent thynges: an indifferent thynge is that which is nether good nor euell / for whether thou do it or do it not / thou ſhalt nether be ryghtwiſe nor vnrightwiſe therfore. For thus doth Iherome hym ſelfe diffiue it / in a epyſtle to ſaynct Auguſtyne. Now what man hauyng his right vnderſtondinge can ſaye the high maſſe / & the vſe of ymages in churches not to be euell? or who can lyghtlye graunt it to be good? The lawe of God doth euedentlye condemne one & other / all ſtraunge worſhippynge & ceremonies / or goddes ſeruyce (/ that is to ſaye) ſuch as are not inſtitute of God / or ſuch as are inuentide by mā with out the worde of God. But what is the high maſſe / els ſaue a ryte or ceremonye ſet vp by mā beſyde the worde of God? For as for Chriſtes ſupper what it is /

Yf the Lorde (ſayth he) be God folowe hym how long wyll you halt on both ſydes?Sophon. l. v In lyke māner Sophonias alſo I wyll diſtroye ſayth he / thoſe perſones that ſwere by the Lorde and by Malchom. Verelye yf the onlye ſacrifice of Chriſt once offryde for the ſynnes of the worlde / maketh the beleuers perfecte: what nede they in ther high maſſes / daylye to offer the bodye and blude of Chriſte for the ſynnes of the quycke & deade.Iohn. v. Marke xvi. v If they which departe in fayth paſſe from death vnto lyf? If they whych dye in vnbeleue / eſcape not dampnacyon to what intente I praye you ſacrifyce they for the deade?Ioh. iiij. If the Lord muſt be worſhipped in ſpyrite and truth / why wynke thes perſones at the doctryne and facte of them whych byd men to worſhyp him in breade? Therfore may we crie wyth Elyas / how longe halt ye on both ſydes? If the ſacryfyce of Chriſt be abſolute or ſufficyent: thynke ſtedfaſtlye that by that only ſacryfice you be made perfecte for euermore. But yf ther be ſacryfice made daylye in the maſſe. Then beleue that you be clenſyd thorowe daylye ſacryfices. Thes thynges can not ſtonde nor agre to gether. More ouer no man nede to blinde hym ſelfe with thes wordes / high maſſe / and lowe maſſe: In the hyghe maſſe are the ſelffe and ſame abhominacyons whych are in the loweſte. In both of them / is the inſtitucyon and ordynaunte of Chryſt peruerted / in both of them is he worſhipped in the broade / in both of them are ydolles ſerued / in both / ſpecially in the ſeruyce of ſaynctes is helpe aſke de at creatures. In both of them is the wicked cānon the greateſt portyon of the maſſe.

Ther is nothyng in it of old antiquite: nothyng of the apoſtolique ſimplycite. Furthermore we muſt alſo marke in ſpecially / in this matter / how the ſcripture requyreth of vs no cloked / but an open confeſſion. Now by ceremonyes and the vſe of ceremonyes we do chefelye confeſſe whath fayth we be of. He that beynge requyryd ſtondyth by at the Turkes and gentyles ſeruyce / grauntyth hym ſelfe to be a pertaker or fauerere of the ſuperſticion of the Turkes and gentyles. He that is preſent at the maſſe when▪ he is requyryd / doth openlye teſtifye / that he doth acknowledge the maſſe / and the maſſes relygyon to be the true ſeruyce of God. Therfore bi his preſence / he eſtablyſſeth all the erroures of the maſſe. He that wyll not be preſent at maſſe / hym take the aduerſaryes for a cō
               tēner of ther ſeruyce / & all the whole papiſtrye. Wherfore by what reaſon that we knowe that the open confeſſion of Chriſt is requyryd of euery one of vs / how lytle of reputacyon ſo euen he be: By the ſame beleue we alſo / that they be vtterlye forbydden to haue any parte wyth the maſſe. Nether is it ſufficient for vs to beleue in the herte and ſecretlye to confeſſe God. The ſyncerefull & playne confeſſion of the tonge muſt goe wyth all. We haue of Orygene / that ther was a certayne ſecte called Helcheſaytes / which tawght thys hereſy that yf in perſecucyon any man ſhowld denye / (I vſe Euſebius wordes in his eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie / the .vi. boke the .xxviij. chap.) the ſame were in no taute / becauſe he that hath a ſtedfaſt hart to God / alltough he denye with his mouth for neceſſyte / yet in his harte he abydyth in the fayth. But I purpoſe not to dyſpute now this queſtyon at large. I haue notyd ſome what concernynge this matter long agoo / in my commentaryes vpon the .viij.ix. & .x. chapters of the fyrſt epyſtle to the Corynthians: & vpon the epiſtle to the Hebrwes / agayne in the booke de origine erroris / which I laſt ouerlokyd & enlargyd. And thys much haue I wrytten to the intent you may perceyue that we be playnelye / not of ther iudgement / which put afflicted perſones in conforte to goo to maſſe / we beleue & do teach rather that the truth ſhould be playnlye confeſſyd / & that all erroure owght to be ſpoken agaynſt / abhorryd & ſhunnyd / & that we owght to dye / rather then to haue any thyng adoe wyth that wycked ſeruyce. We knowe that throwgh much pacyence we muſt ſaue owr ſoules: we knowe that it behouyth vs thorow

many tribulacions to enter into the kingdome of heauen. But yf we may after ſuch a ſorte accordyng as the world goyth / ſemble & diſſemble / chope & chaū
               ge at oure pleaſure in matters of religion / ſuerlye the moſt holy marters of god were ioles / that wold haue nothing to do with ceremonyes which were playne wycked. But ther vpryghtnes &, ſtedfaſtnes was acceptable vnto the Lorde / wherfore he alſo wyll not be dyſpleaſyd at ther holy pertynacite / which had rather ſuffer al maner of extremite then once to make or medle with the wycked ſeruyce of the papyſtes. Thes thinges may you be bolde to ſaye of vs a foore good men & ſuch as be in troble for the truthe / prayeng them to comend vs wyth ther prayers vnto god. More of this matter ſhall mayſter Iohn Becſtayne declare you. For be herde myne other bretherne in the myniſtracion of goddes worde diſpute of this ſame thynge.

            The Epiſtle of Iohn Caluyne.
            THe man to whom ye gaue commyſſion / requyred vs to wryte your aouyſe / how ye myght kepe you from ſtayninge your ſelfe amonge ſo many ſpottes of ſuperſticions / as in the ſtede of the pure & true ſeruyce of god haue gotten place in the church ther with you. As for me I ſuppoſe it ſhalbe ſufficient / to declare you my mynde brefely. Alſo / not hydyng from you what other men do thynke in the meane ſeaſon / conſyderinge that ther is ſome variaū
               ce in this behalfe. The ſame that other men wolde ether deny or wyncke at / ſtonde I at no dowbte to affyrme / namelye / that I vtterlie do not ſubſcribe vnto ther opinyon: So that at the leaſt by this my ſymple confeſſyon / ye maye vnderſtonde / that it ſhalbe farre from all feydnedneſſe what ſo euer I will ſaye. But this one thinge wyll I hartelye praye you that in hearynge me ſpeake of variaunte / ye wyll not be ſore offendyd / as though ye myght haue no thynge of vs / but that is wrappyd with controuerſyes. For as ye ſhall heare / ther is very litle varyaunce betwene vs.

They pondrynge how daungerous a thynge it is to ſnare mens conſcyences in relygion / dare not condē
               ne owght no vnlawfull / that maye by eny meane be excuſyde. More ouer whan they conſyder how many greuouſe wayes they be oppreſſid on euery ſyde / wich ſyue in that captiuite of Babylon / they muſt nedes fauer them in ſome thynges / leaſt that yf they ſhoulde be to importune apon them / it myght vtterlye dyſcomfort ſuch as elles haue a good zeale / and be indewed with a ryght feare of God. But I contrarie wyſe do holde / that it cannot be to ſtraightlye kepte / which the Lorde hath bounde by his worde / and that the godlye oughte not to flatter them ſelues in euell thynges / leſt they be careleſſe in remaynyng therin. Neuertheleſſe I do not denye / but that both the ſame theire reaſons are very good: they alſo graunt me gladlye myne obiection. But it comyth to paſſe (I can not tell howe) that whyle they are to feruent vpon ther conſyderacyons me thynke they are to mercyfull. They alſo iudge me to cruell whyle I remytte nothynge. Verely ther is nothyng that I am more loth to do / then to ſwerue / (how lytle ſo euer it be) from the mynde of ſuche men as the whole church hath worthelye in high eſtimacyon / and whome I alſo pryuatelye haue in reuerence with all my hart. Onelye of ther goodnes let them graunte me this to receaue nothyng againſt the iudgement of my conſcience. Firſt with out any contrauerſye / we all agre in this / that a Chryſten mā is bounde not only to worſhyppe god ſpirituallye in his hart / but alſo to teſtefye the ſame outwardlye. For as the Lord hath conſecratyd our ſowle to gether with the body vnto hym ſelffe / ſo ſhowlde his glorye appeare in both / as S. Paul ſayth: They do but fable therfore that aftyrme it to be ſufficyent / yf a man kepe the purenes of relygion inwardlye: and that God regardyth not owtward thinges / ſo that the mynde remayne whole. And yet not withſtondyng / we do not requyre of euery one / an open confeſſyon of his fayth / But that a godly man neuertheleſſe endeuoure him ſelfe / to profeſſe that worſhippe of the only God & Chriſt which is commendyd vnto vs in hys worde. Agayne / we haue not appoynted this profeſſyon with certayne lymites / ſaue only that euery man (accordyng to the meaſure of his vnderſtonding facultye / & as occaſion is offryd hym) do in any wyſe applye hym ſelfe to ſanctifye the name of god. Wherfore in this matter / we

muſt hādle more with exortacions / then with determinable rulers. For as the faythfull nether may nor owght to be conſtraynyd to any certayne rule / ſo do they fauoure them ſelues to much / yf but in parte onely & that ſlenderlye they vſe the worſhippe of God / ād folow not ſtyll vpon it continuallye & with diligēt laboure as long as they lyue. Let euery mā therfore be dyligent & conſtāt inforcyng hym ſelfe & let him not leue of / tyll he haue ſpecially perſwadid hym ſelffe in this / that he omitte no occaſyon of glorifieng god.
            But one thynge we affirme preciſelye / that they which receyue ſuch vſages as are notable in manifeſt vngodlynes / do ſwarue from that profeſſyon of fayth which all Chriſten men owe vnto ther Lord. For ſeynge that the Lord hath inſtituted ceremonyes / wherby we may be exerſyſed towerd the ſincere worſhippinge of hym / verely lyke as in practiſynge the ſame / we teſtefie our ſelues to be the worſhippers of the lyuing God / euen ſo in vſyng ſuch other as haue the apperaunce either of idolatrye or ſuperſticion / we both diſhonoure the name of God / & defile our ſelues.iij. Regū. xij. For they finally remaine vndefiled / that nether bowe ther knee vnto Baal / nether kyſſe his hād / ner ſweare with ther tonge by another name / then by the name of the lyuyng God. In theſe thinges we do not varye. But whan we come to diſcerne vngodly vſages frō ſuch as be good & accordynge to relygion / ther we ſome what varye: Wherin yet I graunt them this / that ſome vſages therbe which either came vp of a lytle ſuperſticyon / or els are degenerate into ſome ſuperſticyon from ther good origenall / the obſeruinge wherof were not to be reprehended / yf it lacked ſuperſticyon. As for enſample: They that fyrſt lighted candels at the table of the Lorde / ſwarued ſome what from the pureneſſe of the goſpell / bryngynge in a ceremony which yet beinge good / was at the cōmyng of Chryſt abrogate with other perſels of the Ieweſdome / yet the ſame affliction of comlineſſe / (as fonde as it is) whan it proceadeth not to vngodlyneſſe / ther is no of fence of God in obſeruynge it. Other thynges were well inſtitute / which thorow abuſe are ſwarued from ther trueth / which I permytte the godly alſo to obſerue / ſo that the abuſe be not fallen to manifeſt ydolatrye. Neuertheleſſe as conſeruing thē both / it were verelye to be deſyred / that they were either wholye abolyſhed / or els playnlie that they were refourmyde.

But becauſe that lyeth not in a pryuate mans hande / let hym not refuſe to folowe the cuſtome receaued in his church / which cuſtome by right he had rather were taken awaye / or els reformyde: let hym not refuſe it / I ſaye / yf he be brought to it hy neceſſyte: but as long as he may with out offence / let him refrayne from it / that by his rare vſyng therof / he may declare / that he doth not greatly alowe it.
            Here now am I conſtrayned to diſſente from certayne lerned men / whom I els eſteme as fathers / becauſe that amonge this ſorte they reken the hygh maſſe and certayne other ſuch ceremonyes: for they eſteme it to proceade of the ſupper of the Lorde / though it be dyuerſely ſtayned & polluted. And yet do they not denye / but that the opynyons which are of it be wycked and agaynſt God ſuch as a godly hert ought to abhorre. Neuertheles they iudge that a pryuate man is to be excuſed / whiche whyle he may not haue the ſupper of the Lorde purely mynyſtred / doth not refuſe it / torne and rent as it is. But I can not be brought to eſteme it for the ſupper / though the authoures therof do coloure the name of it neuer ſo much.iij. Reg. xij. c For Hieroboam alſo wolde that the calfes which he ſet vp / ſhulde ſheme to be inſtrumentes of the Iewes religion: And the ſame verely was done contrary to the Lordes commaundement / ſo that it was no more lawfull to offer there / then to do ſacryfyces vnto the ydolls of the heythen. Conſideryng therfore that I eſteme the maſſe for a very abhomynacyō / which after no other wyſe is deckte with the name of the holy ſupper / then as an angell of ſathan tranſfygureth hym ſelf into an angell of light / I can not ſe vnder wat pretence a godly man beinge illumynate with Goddes worde / may haue it in reuerence as a pure ceremonye of God.lj. Corin. xi. v For ouer and beſydes that it is manyfeſt / that Chriſt with the holy mynyſtracyon of his ſupper is there had in deryſyon: a deuoute conſcience will not preſume to applye vnto it / the promyſes that were geuen vnto the ſupper. Nether auayleth the excuſe whych ſome men brynge in / that a godly man and ſuch one as feareth God / commeth not ſaue only to be partaker of the prayers and Sacramē
               tes wyth the faythful / but abhorreth from all the vngodly actes which ther are executed / and in the ſecrete affection of his hart doth hate the thinges that he opē
               ly can not improue. For he onlye auoydeth ydolatrye / that refrayneth from the ſacrifices of ydolles.
            
               The maſſe verely is an ydoll ſet vp in the temple of God: when thou therfore art at it / thou ſtondeſt before the ſymple / and geueſt very euyll enſample / for they thynke / thou worſhyppeſt whatſoeuer abhomynacyon is in the maſſe.i. Cor. x.

                I wyll ſtond no longer in this matter / whan Paul to the Corinthians doth ſuffycyently declare / that he is a partaker of the cuppe of deuells / which although he do it without conſcience of ſuperſtycyō / only by outwarde enſample / medleth with prophane vſages: and moreouer that he is gyltye of bloude / becauſe he confirmeth the erroure of the ignoraūt by his enſample.
            Where as it is alledgyd / that there with you the churche is / whoſe communyon is not vtterlye to be excluded / that argumēt alſo is eaſelye dyſſolued. For the church is taken ſondrye wayes. Therfore according to the dyuerſe eſtimacyon therof / we muſt prudentlye dyſcerne / after what ſorte the church of yours is to be reputed. As for me verelye / I beleue that the catholyke churche is ſcattered abrode in all ſuche places as are kepte vnder / thorowe the tyrannye of the Pope.Rom. xi. v For ſeing that the Apoſtle doth teſtyfye / that God can not repent hym of hys callynge / as he gathereth of the Iewes that they ſhall neuer departe wholy frō the grace of God / whych are ones receyued into the inuyolable couenaunte. Euen ſo may we reaſon now / that amōge all nacyons to whom ſo euer the Lorde hath apoynted the eternall couenaunt of the Goſpell / the powre therof remayneth ſtyll: yea they haue Baptyme alſo a ſcale of the couenaunt / which can not be without effect: For how greatly ſo euer the multytude ſelfe haue ſwarued vnto ydolatrye / yet thorowe the vnthankfulnes and vnfaythfulnes of man / can not the wyll of the Lorde be hyndred / but it muſt forth / wherfore we conclude that the Lorde hath allwaye had & yet hath his electe / whoſe ſaluacyon is ſcalyd with ſuch a ſeale of baptyme / as is nether vayne nor wythout any vndoubted ſtrength. And becauſe Baptyme is a ſacrament of the church / the Lorde wold that the callyng vpō his name and ſome apperaunce of the mynyſtracyon ſhould ſtyll remayne there. But as concernynge the very proper bewtye of the church ſuch as is expreſſed vnto vs in the ſcrypture / that do not I knowledge to be the congregacyons of the papyſtrye. The church is it whome Chryſt commaunded to obeye and harken vnto: but whye? euen becauſe it is the pyller and ſtablyſhement

of the truth. As for thoſe they are the neſtes of errours and hereſyes / which by all meanes go aboute to ouer throw the word of God / & ſet vp ydolatry in the ſtead of Goddes true worſhype: yea all kynd of abhomynaciō in the place of true godlyneſſe. Finally I iudge her to be ſuche a ſhape of the church / as was amōge the Iſraelytes / after that Hieroboam had ſet vp a temple & the calues / contrary to the worde of the Lorde.iij. Reg. xij.

                For wyckedly all thinges were peruertyd amonge thē / yet for the honour of Circumciſion the Lorde vouchſaued to graunt the people the name of a church / and therfore by Ezechiel he called them his chylderne that came of them. But wold not the Prophetes therfore haue graū

                Thus ye ſe now how farre we agree / & how great dyuerſyte is betwene vs. This do certayne & godly men requyre of a Chriſten man as well as I: fyrſt that he ſerue God with the inwarde purenes of his hart / & then with owtwarde exercyſes of godlynes to teſtifye the worſhype of the ſprete: This profeſſion do we thynke to conſiſte in two partes / in the confeſſion of the tōge / and in holy obſeruaunces. In declarynge your fayth we can preſcrybe you no meaſure / but that accordinge to your vocacyō / ye ſeke all occaſyons / that the name of God may be ſanctyfyed by you. But ſpecyally ye muſt labour to haue your houſholde well taught in religion. For the Lorde in makyng you ruler ouer your chyldren and ſeruaūtes hath not onely put you in truſt with them that ye ſhould gouerne them in ther duties of cyuilite / but alſo to brynge them vp in godlyneſſe. Touching the ſecōd parte we thinke thus / that al ſuch ceremonies as do conteyne ether manyfeſte ydolatrye or open vngodlyneſſe / are contrary to the profeſſion of that religiō / which a godly man is bounde vnto: wherfore the worſhipping of ymages & ſellyng of Maſſes (that a man ſhould bye thē with monye) and ſuch other lyke thinges / we playnly diſalow. And in this are not godly & lerned men agaynſt me / that it is alſo a Chriſten mans dutye to eſchue thoſe ceremonyes / whiche ſprange of erroure and couetuouſneſſe / & ſayntes holy dayes / wher ther is nothinge that reſembleth or is lyke the holy antiquite of the church: but many thinges are ther prophane and impure. For the worde of God is ther ſhamefully and miſerably peruerted: and prayers

ther be which are either fonde and vnſauerye / or els full of blaſphemyes. Vnder the ſame kynde do we comprehende pardons / brotherheades or fraternites / holy water and ſuch lyke / whoſe begynnyng hath not bene alowable / and the abuſe (yea the very vſe of thē) doth playnely robbe God of his honoure. Now haue we to ſpeake of ſuch as do perteyne nye to the kepyng of the communyon of Chriſten felaſhippe / concernyng the which my conſciēce will not ſuffer me to be of lyke opinion with thoſe ryght vertuous and excellēt men. For they iudge that men owght not to forſake the cō
               munion of a congregacyon / wherin the couenaunte of the Lorde remayneth / & wher his name is called vpō. Ther counſayle is therfore / that men (ſpecially on the ſondayes) do perticipate with thē in prayers / becauſe that then comonly the people aſſemble for this intent / to call vpon God: And the prayers whych are made / be the more pure / becauſe they are of the old church: They conſayle men alſo to be preſent at the Maſſe as at the Lordes ſupper / which how wonderfullye ſo euer it be defyled / deformed / rent aſ

               nder on euery ſyde / corrupt and poluted with wicked opinions / yet by meanes of the certaynte of Godes promes / it remayneth the ſupper for the faythfull. Neuertheles in the meane ſeaſon they inioyne two thinges / that as oft as a Chriſten man goeth to the Maſſe / whyle he him ſelfe may not reforme the abhominacions that ther appeare / he re
               
                  •
               uyre of God by his prayers a reformacion therof: And that then to his poure / as occaſion requyreth / he doth his diligēce that he ſeme not to conſent vnto ydolatrye / nor to ſuch rytes or vſages as do robbe God of his honoure / but that he maye be perceaued to ſeke God and his pure worſhepe / and vtterly to refuſe all ſuch thinges as are contrary to his Goſpell. A certayne godly and lerned man addeth more ouer / how that he wyſſheth that the ſame perſone who ſoeuer he be / ſhould communicate at the table / wherby he may the better teſtyfye / that he ſeketh ther the ſupper of the Lorde. But I wolde wyſhe verely with all my hart / that the ſeruaūt of Chriſt ſhould reuelently take what ſo euer he ſeith ther apperteynynge to his Lorde / ſo that he defyle hym ſelfe with any vncleaneſſe. Notwithſtanding becauſe I ſe no waye wherby the filthyneſſes of ſathan might be ſeperatyd from the holy ceremonyes of oure Lorde and ſauyoure Ieſu Chriſt.

I can in no wyſe ſuffer the outwarde exercyſes of religion to be had in ſuch pryce that the temple which is dedicate vnto god / ſhoulde be ſtayned with ydolatrie. Wherfore yf ye can ther vſe the thynges apperteynyng vnto Chriſt / ſo that ye Ioyne your ſelfe to no wycked and vngodlye ceremonies I wyll gladly graunt it you. Els I can in no wyſe be brought to geue you leaue for to do that which in my iudgemēt is clerlye agaynſt the profeſſion of a Chriſten mā How then (wyll ye ſaye) muſt I not then other chaunge my dwellynge / or els diſpayre? That do not I ſo preſyſelye requyre. Neuertheleſſe my deſyre is / that ye daylye call your ſelfe vnto an accomptes / and caſt with your ſelfe earneſtlye how farre from rendrynge vnto god the worſhyppe that ye owe hym. And this may ye bem one the myſerye of your captyuite vnto hym which only can amende it / and in treate hym bi your continuall prayers / that he wyll reſtore lybertye vnto his people / and renue his holy cyte / wherin pure and ſincere ſacrifyces of prayſe or thākes geuynge may be offrid vp vnto hym. For it is no ſmall ſcourge of the lorde / that ye are cōſtrayned to ſerue ſtraunge goddes. Therfore muſt ye nether mynyſhe it with vayne conſolacions ner fauoure your ſelfe in ſo greate infyrmyte. Wherfore ſe that ye haue allwayſe in mynde / what miſerable caſe ye ſtande in. That ye may with the more earneſt deſyre go aboute to be rydde of it. Such an humble mynde wyll not the lorde for ſake / but eyther make ſome waye of fynall delyueraūce or els ſocoure you thorow his mercye. Fare well. The Lorde bleſſe you and your howſolde.
