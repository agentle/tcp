            To the tune of New Rogero.
            
               
                  ALas what meaneth man,
               with care and greedy paine:
               To wreſt to win a worldly fame
               which is but vile and vaine.
               As though he had no cauſe to doubt,
               the drift of his deſire,
               Not pleaſed though he rule the route,
               but ſtill to couet higher.
            
            
               And wander after will,
               farre paſſing his degrée:
               Not ſo contented ſtill,
               but a king himſelfe to be.
               Subuerting law and right,
               detecting triall true:
               Wringing euery wight,
               that all the realme dooth rue.
            
            
               Whoſe déed and ill deſart,
               compart and falſe conſent:
               I thinke no Chriſten heart,
               can chooſe but néeds lament.
               Alas it ſeemed ſtrange,
               ſuch thraldome in a realme:
               Which wealthie was to waſt away,
               by will that was extreame.
            
            
               Sith vertue was profeſt,
               moſt famous franke and frée:
               Yet men tranſpoſed cleane,
               more vile and worſe to be.
               And ſuch as did pretend
               to ſhew themſelfe moſt holie:
               Haue ſwarued in the end,
               and fawned after follie.
            
            
               Whoſe wordes ſo diſagrée,
               as waters come and go:
               Their liuings to be contrary,
               that ſhould examples ſhowe.
               And fawning after fame,
               purſue their owne decay:
               As though there were no God,
               to call their life away.
            
            
               What ſurety is in man,
               what truth or truſt at all:
               Which frameth what he can,
               to worke vnworthy thrall.
               Oppreſſion hath beene frée,
               the poore alas be ſpoyled:
               Maides and wiues be rauiſhed,
               the ſimple are beguiled.
            
            
               Lawe is made a libertie,
               and right is ouerthrowne:
               Faith is but a fooliſh thing,
               falſehood is alone.
               Pride is counted clenlineſſe,
               and theft is but a ſlight.
               Whoredome is but wantonneſſe,
               and waſte is but delight.
            
            
               Spoiling is but pleaſure,
               riot is but youth:
               Slaunder is a laughing game,
               and lying counted trueth.
               Mariage is but mochage,
               the children counted baſe:
               Thus right is wronged euery way,
               in our accurſed caſe.
            
            
               Flatterie is the Forte of Fame,
               and trueth is troden downe:
               The innocent do beare the blame,
               the wicked winne renowne.
               Thus Sathan hath preuailed long,
               and we for want of grace:
               Haue troden vertue vnder foote,
               and vice hath taken place.
            
            
               But God that is moſt righteous,
               hath ſéene our fatall fall:
               And ſpred his mercie ouer vs,
               to ſhield vs from the thrall.
               Whoſe mercy is ſo infinite,
               to ſuch as were oppreſſed:
               He hath reſtored them to right,
               and hath their care redreſſed.
            
            
               And though that our vnworthineſſe.
               hath not deſerued ſo:
               Now let vs ceaſe our wickedneſſe,
               and graft where grace may grow.
               And let vs pray for our defence,
               our worthy Queene elect:
               That God may worke his will in her,
               our thraldome to correct.
            
            
               That God be chiefely ſerued ſo,
               as dooth to him belong:
               That right may haue his courſe againe,
               and vanquiſh wicked wrong.
               That we may liue in feare and awe,
               and truly to intend:
               And haue the iuſtice of the lawe,
               our cauſes to defend.
            
            
               That truth may take his wonted place,
               and faith be faſt againe:
               And then repent and call for grace,
               that wrought our care and paine.
               That God ſend vs a ſhort redreſſe,
               with wealth and great increaſe:
               And to our Quéene, to reigne and rule,
               in honour, health, and peace.
