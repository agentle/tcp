               PSAL. I.
               BLEST is the man,
               Yea happie than,
               By grace that can
               Eschew ill counsell and the godles gates:
               And walkes not in
               The way of sin,
               Nor doth begin
               To sit with mockers in the scornefull sates.
               But in IEHO VAES law
               Delites aright,
               And studies it to know
               Both day and night:
               That man shall bee
               Like to the tree
               Fast planted by the running riuer growes:
               That frute doth beare
               In tyme of yeare,
               Whose leafe shall neuer fade, nor rute vnlouse.
               

                  

¶ His actions all,
               Ay prosper shall,
               Which shall not fall;
               The godles men but as the calfe or sand:
               That day by day,
               Winde driuith away,
               Therefore, I say,
               The wicked in the judgement shall not stand:
               Nor sinners rise no more
               Whom God disdaines,
               In the assemblie where
               The just remaines:
               For why? the Lord,
               Who bear'th record,
               Doth know the righteous conuersations ay;
               And godles gates,
               Which he so hates,
               Shall quite die, perish & doubtlesse decay.
            
            
               PSALME IIII.
               TO thee I call,
               In my great thrall,
               And troubles all:
               Hear me, ô Lord my God of righteousnesse,
               Of mercie free,
               Thou hast set mee
               At libertie,
               Haue mercie Lord, and rid me from distresse.
               O men of mortall name,
               

                  
How long will yee
               My glorie turne to shame,
               With vanitie?
               O Sonnes of men,
               Why doe ye then
               Seeke after lies with the vngodly ghuest:
               The Lord aboue,
               Doth surelie loue
               The godlie man, and heareth my request.
               ¶ In aw therefore,
               Giue God the glore;
               And sinne no more:
               With quyet mynde examine well your heart.
               Your sweete incense
               Of innocence
               With confidence
               Bring to the Lord, your selues to him conuert.
               The worldlie wretch all day
               Doth neuer cease,
               For well and wealth to pray,
               This life to ease:
               But thou thy grace,
               And louing face
               With brightfull beames make on vs Lord to shine
               Graunt vs thy light
               And fauour bright,
               We pray the Lord thine eare to vs incline.
               ¶ With heart and voice,
               I will rejoice,
               

                  
And make my choise
               Of this thy grace, before all worldlie care:
               This treasure great
               Doth me delite,
               With joy perfite,
               More then the wretch, for al his goods & geas
               As granes and grapes so gay
               In tyme of yeare,
               That filles his heart, I say,
               With joyfull cheare.
               In rest and peace,
               I finde release,
               And willy down, & sleepe with sound repose;
               For thou my guarde,
               And sure rewarde,
               My help, my hope, doest keep me frō my foes.
            
            
               PSALME VI.
               LORD Irequyre,
               That in thme yre
               Fuming as fyre,
               Thou me no wayes rebuke nor yet reject:
               Though I doe swerue,
               And so deserue,
               That I should sterue,
               In mercie Lord, I pray thee yet correct:
               For griefe and anguish he:
               Me so opprest,
               That in my weary bones
               

                  
I finde no rest:
               My soule and mynde,
               Are so sore pynde,
               That it I can expresse in no degree:
               O Lord I say,
               How long delay,
               Wilt thou to cure my woe and miserie?
               ¶ Let thy sweete face,
               And wonted grace
               In tyme and space
               Returne to free my soule from all her paine:
               Not for no thing
               That she can bring;
               That is condigne,
               But for thy mercie freely made her gaine.
               For why? amongst the dead
               Who shall thee praise?
               Shall dust and asse in earth
               Thy glorie blaise?
               My plaintes trewlie,
               So grieuous be,
               That I am like to swerue I am so faint,
               All night I greet,
               My couch I weet
               With trickling tears gusht out with my complaint.
               ¶ Mine eyes dim bee,
               And will not see
               My sinne trewlie,
               And griefe hes so possest my heauie heart;
               

                  
For feare of those,
               That bomy foes,
               And would rejoise
               To see my wreak & would my soule subuert.
               But now away all ye
               That wicked be:
               For the Lord he hath heard
               My plaint and crie:
               And not onelie,
               He hath heard me,
               But granted my request and whole desyre:
               And shall my foes,
               In tyme disclose,
               And thē confound with shame in his hote yre
            
            
               PSALME VIII.
               IEHOVA, Lord
               Who can record
               In writ or word
               Thy name so great on earth & euerie where?
               Which thou hast plaist,
               As pleasde thee best,
               Aud worthiest
               Aboue the heauens and christall cleared aire.
               Thou makes thy laude and praise
               Thy strength and might
               From breath of babes to rise,
               Both day and nigh:
               In suckling ones,
               

                  
Thy graces remaines
               For to be seene, and beautie excellent:
               The mouth to close
               Of godlesse foes.
               That readie are to slay the innocent.
               ¶ When I behold
               The high heauens mould,
               That doth vnfold
               Thy wondrous works by thy owne fingers wroght
               The Moone so bright,
               And starrie light,
               That shines by night:
               With gleaming fires, all formed out of noght:
               What thing is mortall wight,
               Then doe, I say,
               Of whome thou Lord of might,
               Art myndfull ay?
               The Sonne of man,
               What is he than,
               Whom thou by grace doest choose & beautifie
               Yet little lesse,
               I must confesse,
               Thou hast him made then Angels in degree.
               ¶ And thou his name,
               And glorious frame,
               Exalts with same,
               And crownes his head with royall Majestie:
               And as a King,
               Him sets to raigne,
               

                  
Ou'r euerie thing,
               That life, breath, forme & shape hath taine of thee
               As sheepe, Oxe, horse, and beast
               That feeds on land:
               Yea all such things are preast
               At his command:
               The fishe that swym,
               With out-spred fin,
               And fowls eachone that haunt into the Aire:
               IEHOVA Lord,
               Who can record
               Thy Name so great on earth and euery wher?

               OLORD who shall
               Thy tent indwell,
               Celestiall,
               Who shall abide within thine holie hill?
               That walks in light,
               And doth thats right
               With all his might.
               His brothers name doth not reproach & spill:
               Nor yet can heare his fame
               In any sort
               To be imparde with blame,
               Or false report:
               That doth abstaine
               From euerie meane
               And wrongful way to work his neighbour wo
               

                  
And in whose sight
               The wicked wight
               That God despytes, despyted is also.
               ¶ But such as loue
               The Lord aboue,
               He doth approue
               And honors them with loue and reuerence:
               That band doth make,
               And will not breake,
               For losse nor lacke
               That may ensue, nor any such pretence.
               Nor yet doth put his coyne
               To vsurie:
               Nor the just cause purloyne
               Through bry berie,

               These thinges to do,
               And steadfastlie doth keepe the persite way,
               As Syon Hill
               He shall stand still.
               And neuer moue, nor perithe or decay.

               THE Lord most hie,

An heyrde to me,
               I can not long haue stresse nor stand in neede:
               He makes my leare,
               In feelds so fare,
               That without care
               I doe repose, and at my pleasure feede.
               He sweetlie me conuoyes
               To pleasant springes,
               Where nothing me annoyes,
               But pleasure bringes:
               He giues my minde
               Peace in such kinde,
               That feare of foes nor force can not me reaue:
               By him I am lead
               In perfite tread,
               And for his Name he will me neuer leaue.
               ¶ Though I should stay
               Euen day by day,
               In deadlie way,
               Yet would I be assurde, and feare no ill:
               For why? thy grace
               In euerie place
               Doth me imbrace,
               Thy rod & shiphirds-crook comforts me still
               In despyte of my foe,
               My table growes:
               Thou balmes my head with ioy,
               My cuppe ouer-flowes,
               Kindnesse and grace,
               

                  
Mercie and peace,
               Shall follow me for all my wretched dayes:
               Then endles joy,
               Shall me conuoy
               To heauen where I with thee shall be alwaies.

               O LORD of grace,

               From thy high place
               My cause reuenge against my deadlie foes:
               From wicked traine,
               Of fraudfull men,
               That thee misken.
               Saue me, ô Lord, for I in thee rejoise:
               Thou art my God and aide,
               My strength and stay:
               Why go I then dismaide,
               In this array?
               Why shouldst thou mee
               Reject from thee,
               As pray to those that seeke my soule to spill?
               Send out thy light,
               Thy trueth and right
               And guide my wayes vnto thy holie hill.

My God so deare,

               Who doest me heare,
               With readie helpe do now my soule deliuer:
               My soule, why doest thou freate
               Thus in my breast,
               With grudging griefe ouer-set,
               Not taking rest?
               In God most just,
               Set all thy trust,
               And call on him in all thy stresse and greefe:
               I will alwayes,
               Him laude and praise,
               He is my God, my helpe, my whole releefe.

He will send downe
               And saue me from the sharp rebuke & shame
               Of cruell foes,

               His mercie sure shall keepe me from al blame.

               Who trustes in thee, and, shall indure for ay.
               Like Mountaines round about
               Ierusalem:
               IEHOVA so no doubt
               Shall couer him:
               The rod and yocke
               

                  
Of Gods owne flocke
               Shall not ay rest vpon the godlie race:
               Lest they through griefe,
               Without releefe
               The wandring waies of wicked men imbrace.
               ¶ O Lord our God,
               Remoue thy rod,
               Make not abode
               From such as feare thy name with perfite hart:
               And walke vpright,
               Before thy sight,
               In thy trew light,
               Thy grace their guyde let not from them depart
               But such as slide abacke,
               In crooked wayes,
               The Lord shall ouertake,
               With suddaine frayes:
               Their lot and part
               Shall be in smart,
               With sinfull men that perishe in thy rage.
               With Israell.
               Thy peace let dwell
               O blessed Lord, to last from age to age,
            
            
               PSALME CXXVIII.
               OBLEST is hee
               That feareth thee,
               O Lord most hie,
               And doth obserue thy constant will and way:
               

                  
O well to him,
               That hath begun
               This course to run;
               His labour shall him pleasant frute repay:
               To his great joyes encrease
               In reuthfull neede,
               IEHOVA will him dresse
               His life to feede:
               His wife shall bee
               Like to the tree
               That growes full gay fast by his houses side:
               His children fair,
               Like Olyues rare,
               His table shall decore both tyme and tyde.
               ¶ Such mans successe,
               And happinesse.
               Shall still increase,
               As feares thee, ô Lord most righteous:
               Thou wilt not misse,
               Right so to blesse
               Both him and his
               With riches rare and pleasure plenteous:
               From Sions holie Hill
               Thou shalt see then
               To stand and flourish still
               Ierusalem:
               Thy race and seede,
               Shall budde and breed
               Before thine eyes in happie state and store.
               

                  
With Israell,
               And Iuda shall
               Thy peace, ô Lord, abyde for euer more.
            
            
               THE SONG OF SIMEON, S. Luke 2. verse 25.
               
                  SINCE that mine eye
                  Before I die,
                  O Lord doth see
                  Thine holie one, our hope and onelie stay:
                  Whom thou hast send,
                  In latter end
                  For to extend
                  Thy mercies great, that doe endure for ay:
                  Then let thy seruant Lord,
                  Depart in peace:
                  And me of thine accord,
                  Send to my place,
                  As thou hast said,
                  And promise made
                  That can not faile nor fall in vaine away:
                  For I rejoyce,
                  In heart and voyce,
                  That I'haue seene thy sauing health this day.
                  ¶ Whom thou a light,
                  Hast set full bright,
                  Before the sight
                  Of Ger tiles far and people round about:
                  And sendst with grace.

                  To rid from thral, and saue them by his might;
                  That he their glore,
                  For euer more.
                  On Sion hill may shine in beautie bright.

                  O King of Kings
                  In heauen that rings,
                  Aboue all things,
                  Thy people chosen of thine onelie grace:
                  To raigne with thee
                  Eternallie,
                  Them sanctifie
                  Into thy sweete and euerlasting peace:
                  Laude to the Trinitie,

One God in persones three:

                  All praise redound
                  To thee ô Father with thy Son most sweete:
                  That Prince of glore,
                  Did vs restore,
                  Likewise all praise be to the holie Spirite.
               
            
            Gloria in excelsis Deo. Amen.
