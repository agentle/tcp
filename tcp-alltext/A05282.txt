               Sanguine placactis ventos & virgine caesa: the boysterous windes (as poets faine) were stilled with virgins blood, but here no virgins blood, no Princes blood, no martyrs blood, no Sauiours blood, can quench the fire and furie of popish indignation, or appease their God Apollyon, who pitieth neither sex, nor age, person, or presence, be they quicke, or be they dead, all is one. Bucers bones must he burned, and the sacred soule of Queene Elizabeth, her Manes, spirit, and ghost, may not passe to blisse, without a blast of Parsons poysoned penne, and breath, thinking it not sufficient to glut themselues with the blood of their Soueraignes, vnlesse with their buried bones they might ransacke their blessed soules.

            Time was when an Angell durst not reproue a diuell, but said, The Lord rebuke thee. Now Iesuited diuels dare reproue Angels sent from God to be our Soueraignes, and say, Rauelacke may kill thee.
            Time was when none might touch the Lords annoynted, or doe his prophets any harme. Now popish powder may blow vp, popish knife may kill,

and popish brambles may teare the flesh of Kings.
            Time was when Rulers were regarded, and Kings had their Maiesties, quicke and dead, as the Royall Chappell of Westminster can witnes, euen frō their Diademes, downe to their dust. But now Iesuited crueltie may crush all rule, burst the bandes of all obedience, curse Kings, ouer-awe authoritie, & are so farre from honouring the shrines and maiestie of Princes here on earth, as they haue not spared to maligne their soules in heauen. In a word trust them, who will, and they shall finde their doome is still for death, their drumme for destruction, and their march in the cry of Edome, Downe with it, downe with it, euen to the ground.
            
            A man would haue thought they might haue spared her soule, whose body they could neuer still, with more then thousand intended treasons against her state, and person, by poyson, stabb, and shot: by forraine inuasions, homerebellions, and domesticall incumbrances, from all which the Lord still made her glorious by deliuerance. And now her soule being tied in the bundle of the liuing, and she gathered vnto her fathers in peace, they cannot spare to banne what God hath blessed.
            
               I shall not neede to stand in defence either of her sacred life, or death, whose saued soule the heauen of heauens doth now possesse. Neither shall I neede to beate backe his poysoned breath, who now is breathlesse, & knoweth by this what it is to haue touched the Lords annoyn

For were their pennes as perillous as their powder, the shot were more dangerous, but (to God be the praise) truth hath discouered their penne of ignorance, and their powder of treason. My purpose is not to stirre Elizabeths sacred hearse, whose graue is full of Princely earth, and her obsequies are ended, my thoughts are higher euē to match her Manes in blisse, with greatest of Soueraignes there (Soueraigntie it selfe onely excepted) I meane with Dauid, Iosua, and Ezekia, guides, and Kings of Israels Iudah.

Shee a Kings daughter, so are you: shee a maiden Queene, you a Virgin Prince: her name is yours, her blood is yours, her carriage is yours, her countenance yours, like pietie towards God, like pittie towards men: onely the difference stands in this; that the faire flower of her youth is fallen; yours flourisheth like a Rose of Saram, and a Lilly of the Valley. Her dayes are determined on earth, and begun in heauen; yours are a doing on earth: and blessed be the current till they bee ended: euer may your happinesse growe together, and make you blessed with that immortall crowne, that withereth not.
            The Sermons I here present, were preached vnder the shadowe of her blessed gouernment▪ and in the three last yeares of her gracious raigne. When (if God of the surplusage of his loue towards this English nation had not ended one mercy with the beginning of another) I feare our mourning dayes had not beene yet ended.

One is easily ouercome, and two will make resistance, but this threefold gable is not lightly broken, being beautifull as the bands of Zachary, wherewith the Church is honoured, the State is strengthened, the subiect is comforted, and our soueraigne Lord the King your father, no lesse blessed in his three children, then in his three Kingdomes. The Lord God of heauen, maker of Kings, and directer of Crownes, giue vnto you all grace in this life, and glory in a better.

            And such is, or ought to bee, the entercourse of loue & loyaltie betwixt prince & people; happie Prince so praied for, blessed people so prouided for, and Israels Iuda was blessed in both.
            Now the matter of their praier was, that God would establish his promise made to Dauid their King, concerning his church: that he might build a place for his aboade in Sion, the mountaine of his holinesse. ItPsal. 93. was his care, it was his affliction. I say affliction much affecting his royall heart, that himselfe with the nobles of Iuda and Israel, should haue their solace in seeled houses, whilest the Arke of God was couered with2. Sam. 7. 2. skinnes, dwelt in tents, and had neuer a cottage to shroude in.

            For euen now the stones of Sion lye in the dust, and her ruines are vnrepaired,Lament. 1 4. the holy people are helplesse, piety is a pilgrim vpon the earth, & the little flocke findeth poore pasture to feed vpō, euerin motion neuer at quiet til it come, & retyre into the bosom of it best beloued, like the doue in the deluge who foūd no rest for the soaleGen. 8. 9. of her foote, till shee returned againe vnto the Arke.
            This Arke thus tossed in the deluge, and tyred in the wildernes, despised of the heathen, & much neglected of the true borne

Iewe, together with Labans much lowring at home, when in Iacob it was consumed abroadeGen. 31. 40. with heate in the day, and with frost in the night, weather beaten and weary, till Dauid a Type of Christ gaue it rest, who eatenActs 13. 22. Psal. 49. 9. vp with the zeale of Gods house deuoured all difficulties for the accomplishment, who thought vpon nothing more then of a place, and habitation for his holinesse to dwell in, his meate went from him, so did his sleepe, and hee charged his soule with an oath to God for the performance.
            These holy thoughts thus affecting his heart, & afflicting his soule, made the people sensible of his sorrowes, and therefore pierced their hearts to prouoke their prayer thus, Lord remember Dauid in all his Afflictions.
            
            Wherein I doe obserue two things of1 speciall note, the first is, the peoples passion for their King, they are afflicted with him▪ and therfore they pray for him, the second is Dauids preparation for the people, hee is2 carefull of them, and therefore he prouides for them a place: an habitation for the Lord to dwell in. So as their feete might now wander

no more, but stand in the great congregation they loued so wel, and by the Altars of their God they held so deare.
            And for the first: I meane the peoples passiō for their King, ye know the saying of old, Componitur orbis Regis ad exemplū. AndClaudian: it hath it extent from Court to Country, for peoples passions are framed to their Princes affections, like Hippocrates twins they weepe together, and they laugh together, they liue together, and they dye together, witnesse their ioynt sorrowes after Abners herse; the King wept, and the people wept, & though the people would feast; yet when2. Sam. 3. they sawe the King would fast, it pleased them, for as the text saith, whatsoeuer the King did pleased the people. His passions were theirs, his afflictions were theirs, to teach vs that peoples actions doe Sympathize with Princes affections, the Court is dead if the King bee not cheerefull, and subiects sorrowe, when their soueraignes are sadde, Princes smyles, are peoples ioyes like the lustre of the same, so are the countenance of Kings: with their shine they carie comforts, but neuer so little shadowed with clowdes of griefe, (good

Lord) how the subiect then mourneth, deare is the loue of God in the soules of his Saints, but next to that is the sacred band of loue and loyaltie to Princes, fathers, friendes and families are further off, soueraignes are the highest in the rancke.
            If leasure would serue to turne ouer some fewe leaues of sorrowe, and search into the records of griefe, easily might I finde that peoples passions, for their Princes haue beene most piercing, great was their care ouer Dauid, when they stayed him from the battel, least the light of Israel should be extinguished. So was it ouer Saul when2. Sam. 21 17. they mourned his funerals with this dolefull dittie; Yee mountaines of Gilboah, vpon you bee neither dewe, nor rayne, nor fieldes of offering for then the shield of the mightie is cast
               2. Sam. 1. 21. 
               downe. The shield of Saul, as though he had not beene annointed with oyle.
            
            The mourning of Hadadrimmon in theZachar. 12. 11. 12. valley of Megiddo, where Iosias was slaine, wil neuer bee forgotten, where euery familie mourned a part, &c. and vttered their passions with this pitifull plaint, the Crowne of

               Lastly, that one may stand for all, I appeale to your owne passions, who haue at any time seene your own soueraigne, whether your teares of ioy haue not expressed your feare of griefe, mourning like the Turtle-Doue, whose sweetest song is in her sorrowe; least hauing lost her mate shee should not finde him: and hauing found her mate, least shee might loose him, thousands within the kingdome doe thus blend in their moyst and mixt teares vpon the sight and thoughts of their soueraigne.
            And here leaue we the peoples passions, and come wee to their praier, the sweete perfume of their deuotion in these wordes. LORD remember Dauid in all his affliction.
            
            Wherein first I doe obserue, in that the people flye to GOD for their King with no lesse loue, then loyaltie theyRom. 13. Prou. 8. 15. 16. Psal. 77. hold that the powers that are ordained of God, they hold that he looseth the collar of kings, & girdeth their loynes with a girdle, they hold that he sitteth in the middest of magistrats, & demandeth an accoūt of their gouernment, I say they hold that it is hee,

            Antichristian then, miserable & damnable, is the doctrine of all such as dare say, that Popes may either set vp, or pull down Princes, discharge the subiect of his obedience, put a knife in the hād of any to sheath it in the bowels of their soueraignes. Antichristian was the practise of that proude Pope, who trod vpon the neck of Kings & Emperours, & made them to hold his stirrop,

               2. Sam. 6. with gladnesse brought it into his owne citie, and set it in his place in the midst of the Tabernacle that Dauid hadde pitched for it: where after hee had offered burnt offerings, and peace offerings before the Lord, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord of hoasts.
            How this care continued his rule, it may appeare by the princely preparation hee made, as of the place to build vpon, so of things necessarie for the building, of Algunum wood, fyr-trees, & Caedars from Tyre, Sidon and Lebanon, of gold from Ophyr, of pearle from the Iles, of siluer, brasse, and Iron, from all about his kingdome, all totalled by Dauid himselfe, when he bequeathed it to God as a legacie for Salomon his sonne, to bestowe vppon the Temple. In these wordes, Behold my sonne, according to

            It is memorable, and of due regard, what the Lord commaunded Moses for the Fabricke of the Tabernacle, how all such, whose hearts gaue it freely, should offer towards the building, for forced obedience fashioneth not with God, hee loueth the cheerfull giuer, and faithfull receiuer.

               Dauid commaunded all the Princes of Israel to helpe Salomon his Sonne, saying:

            See the passage of his passions, and▪ how hee aggrauates his Afflictions, for the Church, with his Affections towardes the Church, both in his life, and at his death: as if hee should haue saide; Now must▪ I die, yet burie these my last words in your dearest Thoughts, and thinke vpon them, when I am gone.
            I haue liued to fight your battels, and haue quieted the Land before your eyes, I haue beene your King in warre, that peace might bee within your borders, and by my hand the Lord hath giuen you rest on euery side. Now therefore, see to his rest who hath thus repaired your ruines, builde God an House, with an habitation to dwell in: Bring in the ARKE of the COVENANT, and the Vessels, couer it with a vaile: Turne your tossed Tentes into a▪ steaddie Temple. Wander no more in the wildernesse of Shinai, (which is shaken)

but come to mount Sion, and there abide by his holinesse.
            You may build, so may not I, for that I haue beene a man of blood, yet haue I1. Chron. 28. 2. thought it a duty wel beseeming my place, to leaue nothing vndone that may further the worke, and helpe my successor, looke into my store when I am dead, and see my prouision that I haue made for the house of my God.
            I haue prepared Caedars from Sidon, and Algunum wood from Tire, an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of siluer, of brasse, and of1. Chron. 29. 2. &c. Iron passing weight, I haue prepared masōs to hew, and polish the stones, carpenters to fashion, and frame the timber, & all men expert in euery worke.
            But whats all this wealth if it bee not bestowed, and what is all this matter if it want forme? and what of all this prouision if it come to no perfection? when it falleth into the worke, then it is fashionable; but lying vpon an heape it hath no honour.
            In regard whereof the good King was carefull euen at his death to charge both suruiuing Prince, and Peere by a double

bond of a double dutie; one of faith to God, another of fealtie towards their King, that they should be carefull of the worke: Salomon to builde, and his Princes to be ayding.
            Whereby wee are taught, if wee list to learne, that as matter is nothing without forme, and prouision is lesse, if it fall into no worke, so Princes (though potentates in themselues) yet are farre vnable to performe much: either for the good of the Church, or common-wealth, but as they are aided by Peere and people.

               Iabin King of Canaan, the Princes of Isachar were with Deborah, and Isachar, and also Barach, hee was set on his feete in the valley, it was in the day of battell, and they fought for Deborah: but the diuisions of Reuben were great thoughts of heart, and Meros with her inhabitants were cursed of GOD, for that they came not to helpe the LORD, against the mightie.
            
               I am not able to beare you my selfe alone,Deut. 1. so saide Moses in the day of his gouernement,

how can I alone beare your cumbrances, & your charge, & your strife, bring you men of wisdom & vnderstāding, and knowne among your Tribes, and I will make them Rulers ouer you, if in the day of battel, gouernement, and grieuances, Prince and people were aiding vnto their King? why not in the dayes of their Afflictions, while they builde the Church, should not Peere and people helpe to further the worke.
            Surely, surely, this mutuall helpe twixt Prince, Peere, and People, is the maine Buttresse of States and Kingdoms. Kings may commannd, Peere, and People must obey, and all must lay their handes to the worke: if either they looke to builde anewe, holde vp that which is built, or repaire the ruines of that which is decayed.
            What maruell then, if Dauid for a Legacie of his loue to build God an house, layed his cōmand vpon the Princes of Israel, that they should remember him in this, when he was gone, and looke vpon him in his louing Sonne, liue to aide him in the worke he had begun, and neuer leaue him till hee perfected the worke, obliged thereunto by

double band of a double debte, one to God, whose worke it was, another to the King, whose Subiects they were: Not doubting but their Religious loue to the King of Heauen, and like loyaltie to their King on earth, would tye them by sacred vowe and Oath to God, as it had done him, neuer to take good rest, or sweete repose till they had built God an house, an habitatiō to dwell in.
            And so for Conclusion to you, mightie Kings and Potentates of the worlde, search the sacred Register, and yee shall neuer rue the reading, how Dauid, with the care of Gods house, and Religion, hee began his dayes, continued his Raigne, and honoured his death. Hee fought for it, he prayed for it, hee prepared for it, hee cast for it all the dayes of his life, and hee cared for it at the houre of his death, deeming it a dismall dissolution, for a King to passe out of this world without an holy resolution of a better, together, with paine and passion of the posteritie, how to build God, his Christ, and Church in their dearest Thoughts.
            But it may bee demaunded, where is Abiathar, in all this businesse? Where are the Priests and Leuites, and why doe they

neither build nor prepare for the worke; Is the King afflicted, and are they without passion? doth the King take no rest, and are they at ease in Sion? surely it seemed expedient there should bee neither mention, nor memory made of them in this place, least happely they might seeme to take precedencie from Princes in manageing the affaires of the Church, practise they may in it, but neither may they prepare with Dauid, build with Salomon, pray, sing, and sacrifice they may; order they may not, for the Corites must be ordered by Dauid, preach they may, rule they mayPope with prince hath neither pre

            So auerse from God, and so opposite to the mildnesse of Christ, as hee may well be called that Antichrist, and man of Rome, the ruine of all Religion. For Christ was poore, hee is rich, Christ was Crowned with golde, and Diamonds. Christ was lowely, riding vpon an Asse. Hee exalted vppon

the shoulders of men. Christ his Kingdome not of this world, his altogether of this world, both in power and pompe.
            In a word, Christ gaue all, hee taketh all, and giueth nothing, vnlesse it bee, in giuing that, which is not his owne: As Absolution from sinnes, Pardon from paine, Kingdomes from Princes, as hee did this kingdome of England.
            But all the cunning is in catching, and in the meane time, wee blesse our God in heauen, and leaue this earthlie God, to sporte himselfe, with his vsurped power, in giuing Pardon to those that neede it not, Blessing to those that desire it not, Cursing to those that care not for it, and Crownes, to such as by the grace of God, shall neuer weare them.
            What should I say more, but make way to the rest? and assure you of this, That this mysterie of iniquitie, of Popes power ouer Kinges, was first reuealed, and broken forth then, when Boniface the third obtained of Phocas, to bee called vniuersall Bishop, and since that time.
            
               Perijt virtus Imperatorum, & Pietas Pontificum. The Emperours waxed

weake, and the Bishops wicked, whereas before they were of a milder spirit, moulded to greater obedience, more subiect to their Soueraigne, and yeelding to Princes that which was their due.
            You are religiously wise, and by this little which I haue said you haue seene enough, I will therefore say no more but rest my selfe, and I hope you vpon this loyall resolution, that Dauid is set before al in the Genealogie of Christ, for that the dignity of aMatth. 1. 1.

            Which to effect as you haue heard, was Dauids care both in his life & at his death, leauing it as a legacie to Salomon his sonne, and successe together with his Peares, and Princes that as Simon in the Machabees

            Pardon me in your patience a while, If to parallel these Princes praiers, in their precedencie with God, I leaue not out our owne Princes at home, the perfume of whose praiers are yet sweete in this our English Eden, and like the smell of a fieldGen. 27. 27. which the Lord hath blessed, that powerfull praier of Edward the sixt made at his death and in the houre of his dissolution shall neuer die while the state standethHolinshed in Chron. but euer be blessed by it, O my God defend this Realme from papistry, and maintaine thy true religion, that I and thy people may praise thy holy name: and therewith all he said, I am faint Lord haue mercy vpon me and take my spirit.

            Surely, surely, a Prince so high in the fauour of God, and so mightie with men, so blessed with daies, and prosperous in her raigne, so beloued at home, and so dread abroade, so absolute for blessings, and so admired for gouernment was neuer seene in England. Herauld thy praier was powerfull and preuailed with God, for thy proclamation hath wrought heauē & filled the earth with the cloude, and glory of her happie raigne. I might here speake to make good the doctrine I aime at of that disastrous disease of our nation, the Kings euill, cured by no hand, but of the Lords annoynted, vpon whose sacred touch and prayer, thousands within the kingdome haue beene deliuered

            And thus you see: how Princes praiers, & pleadings with God haue much preuailed,Rom. 8. 23 being graced with faith, not a creature of God but it stands at their checke, if they grieue, the creatures groane after a deliuerance, God in heauen, and his Gods on earth doe sympathise, they soare high whoNumb. 27. 16. came from an high, and their generous spirits beg much at the hāds of the Lord God of spirits, there was neuer yet any truly noble, or of an honorable descent, but from an heauēly ascēt. Its not your royall blood, but the honour of your God that makes you noble: your greatnes is in the breath of his being according to that, Nemo vir magnus vnquā extitit sine diuino aliquo afflatu & numine, there was neuer yet any great

man moulded on earth, but had his minde inspired with some diuine influence from heauen.
            And now from the combate Iosua had with his God by praier, come we to the command he had ouer the creature by the word, wherein spare me a while to speake, & it shall be as I hope a seasonable instructiō lessoning vs how to demeane our selues toward God, as the whole hoste of his creatures may stand either for vs, if we doe wel, or against vs, if we doe euill, the lesson is short and soone taken out.
            For if we be at enmitie with God, then all his creatures wil be at enmitie with vs, The earth will swallow vs, the water will drowne vs, the aire will infect vs, & the fire will consume vs, Yea the basest creatures vpon the earth will bandie our destruction, wormes will eate our entrals, Lice will consume our faire flesh, flies will fright vs, and frogges will leape into our Kings chambers, monstrous visions will trouble vs, and make vs swoone, as though our owne soules shouldWisdom. 17. 9. 10. &c. betray vs, the darkenes of the night will be intollerable, and the thoughts of the graue insupportable, What should I say more?

the whistling of the windes, chierping of birds, amongst the thicke branches, the water falls, the skipping and roaring of wild beasts, with the sound that answereth againe in the hollow mountaines, these fearefull things (as Salomon saith) will make vs appalled for the lesse, that the hope is whithin, the more is our torment without.
            Nay which is more then all I haue said, and I yearne to speake it, if we be at enmitie with God, his word, and Sacraments, wil be our enemies, the law will fright vs, and the Gospell will flatter vs to our destruction, the blessed Sacraments, seales of our assurance wil rubbe off, if vnreuerētly we rubbe vpon him, Psalmes, Hymnes and spirituall songs will turne to dolefull ditties, and our melancholy will marre our melodie, Songs of Sion to vs will be but songs of sorrow with a woe and welladaie, that euer we were at enmitie with our God and Christ.
            But è regione altera, if we be in amitie, and friends with God, as Iosua was, then all his creatures will fawne vpon vs, the earth will support vs, and the aire will cheare vs, the water will coole vs, and the fire will comfort

vs, our meate will feede vs, and our clothes will warme vs, our houses will shroude vs, and our beds will ease vs, yea and God will make our greatest enemies, either our friends or our footestoole.
            What should I say more? if God be thy friend, the beast that beares thee, will bid thee beware as he did Balaam, and Ionathans arrow will bid thee be gone as he did Dauid, thy weake sling and peeble stone shall quell a Giant, and with the iawe bone of an asse thou shalt kill a thousand, Starres shall fight for thee as they did for Deborah, and the riuer Kison shall sweepe them away. Rauens shall feede thee as they did the Prophet, and the Cocke shall crowe thee to repentance as he did Peter.
            
            Nay if thou be in amitie with God, the night will be short and thy sleepe sweete, the graue will be to thee as a bed of downe, there to rest till the day of thy resurrection, word, Sacraments and Sabaothes will be thy solace, till thou come to that Sabaoth of rest, thy prayers will sent sweete as perfume, and thy praises sound in thy soule like harmonie of the heauens.
            
               In a word, and so to conclude with my text, and close with your religious eares, and hearts, ye may not maruell if Iosua hauing God his friend, had also the cōmaund of his fairest creatures, and bad them stand still who neuer stood before, for the prayer of a righteous man auaileth much, if it be feruent. Elias was a man subiect to like passions as we are, and hee praied earnestly that it might not raine, & it rained not on the earth for three yeares, & sixe monthes, and he praied againe, and the heauens gaue raine, and the earth brought forth her fruite.
            The vse is good and much to our comfort, if we be feruent in praier, for we haue a greater commaund then either Iosua or Elias had, they commaunded but the creatures, we commaund the creator, euen the Lords Christ, we bring him down, we must make him ours, with all the benefits of his passion euen remission of sinnes, and euerlasting life to the which God bring vs.
            And let this suffice to satisfie you of Iosua his great puisance, as preuailing with God by prayer, and with his creatures by

command. All the Hoast of heauen, earth and hell being (as I haue told you) mans Hostes from the Lord of Hoasts, whilest we be friends with God, and fetch them off by faith, either to defend our selues, or offend our enemies in the day of battel, otherwise if we be at enmitie with God, as likewise I haue said the basest of his creatures, as lice, flies and frogs are big enoughExod. 8. 3. &c. to beate downe Pharao in his pride, or the greatest monarke in this world in his presumption against the Lord.
            And now come we from the praier and word of Iosua, to the arme and sword of Iosua, which likewise preuailed against theIosua. 10. 19. &c. fiue Kings of the Amorites, and subdued them in the valley of Aialon.

            For when Dauid (that sweete singer of2. Sam. 23 1. Psal. 147. 12. &c. 
               Israel) would stir vp Hierusalem to praise the Lord for the blessings of the land amongst many blessings there mentioned, first in the ranke hee marshals this. Hee hath made the barres of thy gates strong, hee doth not say, hee hath made thee strong, but hee hath made sure the barres of thy gates. Wee are his, but the bars are ours, nor may wee so depend vppon the helpe of our God, as wee may cast away the meanes of our defence, for Non aufert portas diuina prouidentia, sed corroborat, the Lordes prouidence takes away no gates, but makes them strong, the gates are ours, but the prouidence is his. Hee takes away no Kinges, no garrisons, no golde, no shippes, no shotte, no men, or munition, all these are barres of our defence, and they are ours, but the prouidēce is his: he takes away no lawes, no liberties, no customes, no toll, or tribute, all these are bars, and all are ours, but the prouidence is his, hee takes away no counsell of state, no nobilitie, no gentrie or commons of the land, but hee makes them all

sure barres of thy gates O England, and these are ours, but the prouidence is his.
            In fine, and for conclusion of all, England hath her barres of yron, and gates of brasse, and her wall is impregnable, invironed with rocks, shelues & seas, and by them we are fortified Ad miraculum vs

If our barres be neuer so strong, wickednes will burst them. Its not our situation in the seaes, nor association with Put and Lubin, the greatest of our neighbour kingdomes can keepe vs from captiuitie, if either we presume vpon our might, or neglect the meanes of our saluation, by the word, or preseruation by the sword. Iosua was a Sauiour of his people, and by meanes of both, he wrought their deliuerance, and in the right of both hee held his inheritance.
            But it may be demanded what it was that put such spirit into Iosua, and made him to aduenture vpon all these so great difficulties, surely search & you shall find that the match that kindled the fire burned in the breast of Iosua, and inflamed his royall hart with courage to contend with God his fairest creatures, and cruell Kings, was the promise & assurance God gaue him of the victorie, as you may see in the precedent verses of my text, when the Lord said vnto Iosua: feare them not, for I haue giuen them into

               Now in this promise was the might of his power, his prowesse, and all his puisance, his thought of the promise so eleuated his soule aboue, with assurance of deliuerance, that he neuer doubted daunger belowe, it may be hee thought vpon the promise that made the barren wombeGen. 17. 15. &c. of Sarah fruitfull, it may be hee thought vpon the promise God made to Iacob in his daungerous peregrination to Bethel, Ero tecum. It may be hee thought vponGen. 28. 15. the promise of Israels deliuerance out of Aegipt: and how the Lord made it good with an high and mightie hand, hee knewExod. 3. 20. that arme was not weakened, nor his hand shortened, nor his power limited to binde the heauens to obey his will, and makeEsay. 59. good his promise of Israels safetie, and the Amorites confusion.
            Thus armed with the promise, hee fell vpon the enemie pell mell, hee feared neither might, nor multitude, hee slewe them with a great slaughter at Gideon, and chased them a long the way that goeth to Beth horon, he smote

then to Azecha and to Machedah, but see vppon the sudden, how the spirits of the mightie were daunted, how the army was discomfited, and Israel endaungered, their glorious day begunne to bee darkened with a gloomie night, and when the fight was at the fairest, they had lost the fielde if Iosua his prayer hadde not preuailed with his GOD, for a longer day, that the sunne in Gibeon, and the Moone in Aialon might yeelde their shine; till their swordes were sated with the blood of the heathen.
            And it is a secret in the Lordes promises, that for the most part they are in the generall without mention of particular meanes, I haue giuen them into thy hands, but by what meanes? It is not mentioned, to teachIosua 10. 8. vs that the LORD is a free Agent, and is tyed to no particular, all the creatures of GOD are his: to make good his glorie, and protect his Church: where hee will, when hee will, and as hee will, hee that put into the hand of Sampson the Iawe bone of an asse to beate downe the Philistines,

might say with greater maiestie then Sampson might, with the jawe-bone of an Asse, are heapes vppon heapes, with the jawebone of an Asse haue I killed a thousand: Nay rather, with the brightnesse of the Sunne are heapes vppon heapes, and with the bodie of the Sunne haue I killed a thousand, supported with the promise made vnto me from the height of all sublimitie.
            I haue now power ouer the glorious creature, to commaund it light, and to double the day for our deliuerance.
            It may bee (my brethren,) that when Iosuah sawe by the approach of the blacke night, that all other succours failed. It may bee the promise had a checke in his heart, and for a while his faith fought with frailtie.

            The vse of this Doctrine, concerningHeb. 4. 1. &c. the promise of our God, is good, as in temporall, so in spirituall deliuerances: and therefore I say, with the blessed Apostle. Let vs feare, least at any time, by forsaking the promise of entering into his rest, any of you should seeme to be depriued.
            
               Dauid saide, my foote had welneare slipped,Psal. 73. 2 &c. but hee recouered himselfe, by laying hold vpon the promise. All falls are fearefull,Prou. 24. 16. but yet recouerable, if wee forsake not the promise. But so long as wee leaue the promise, we faile of grace, & thats a fearfull fall, to fall from Moses, and to light vpon Christ, is no danger; to fall from the Lawe and to hit the Gospell, is no perill. To fallHeb. 3. 12 through sinne, and to hit a Sauiour, is recouerable, but if we misse a Sauiour & fall vpon sinne: if we forsake the Gospel and light vpon the law, if wee leaue Christ, and followGal. 3, 24. 
               Moses, if we forsake the promise of his sauing grace, we shall both feele, and find that our case is dangerous, deadly, and desperate. Besides; the perill of being depriued for euer

entering into his Rest.
            The Angels fell, Caine fell, Iudas fell, Achitophel fell; Had any of these fallen vpon their CHRIST, they had neuer fallen so farre: but all mist the promise, and for that they are gone, their fall is irrecouerable.
            Howbeit, when anie of the Patriarches fell, Kings, or Prophets; when Peter, Paul, fell, or the dearest Disciple of Christ fell, all recouered their Falles, by feeling the Promise, which was the holde of their inheritance, and so with speedie passage, they flew vp in all their Afflictions, into the bosome of the Promise, as it were, euen fromHeb. 10. 22. 23. the nethermost hell, to the highest heauēs.
            What should we then doe, but hold fast our profession, and rest vpon his promise, as Iosuah did? and so goe boldely to the Throne of Grace, that wee may receiue mercie, and finde Grace, to helpe in timeHeb. 4. 1

               Iosua hauing passed Iorden, he set vp Circumcision
               Iosua 5. 2 againe the second time, which for fortie yeares space had beene left off in the wildernesse. Queene Elizabeth purged the Sacraments of her Christ, and reduced them to their right forme, left off, if not welneare lost in the vaste wildernesse of popish impietie, for more then fortie yeares ten times told.
            
               Iosua was directed in all his wayes byIosua 1. 8 the booke of the Lawe, and what other starre hath guided the heart of Queene Elizabeth, there was not a word of all that GOD commanded, which Iosua caused not to bee read openly. So shee the euerlastingIosua 8. 34. 35. Gospell to bee preached and published throughout all her Realmes and Dominions.

            Queene Elizabeth hath bound her people by statutes and lawes, to the worship of God, her selfe not second to anie, in rendering her vowes.
            There was none able to withstand Iosuah all his life, for the Lorde was with him,Iosua. 1. 5. and hee was famous throughout all the worlde.
            Queene Elizabeth hath beaten backe all her enemies, and who hath resisted her power? for which her prayers is with God, and her fame with men.
            At the sounde of the Trumpet, theIosua. 6. 1. walles of Iericho fell, after Iosuah had compassed it about seuen times, with the shower, and shoute of his deuotion.
            Not seuen times, but seuentie times seuen times, hath Qu. Elizabeth by prayer to God, & prophecying with men, sacked that Romish Iericho, whose walles (to God be the praise) by her princely power, and prayer, are well shiuered at home, & shaken abroad, with Iosuah his curse, to all such as shall repaire

the ruines, cursed bee the man before the Lorde, that raiseth vp, and builds vp this Romish Iericho.

Achans rebellion is discouered in Ireland, in the north of England, and in the south themselues, with their Babilonish garment. Sicles of siluer, and wedges of golde, execrable things in the Hoast, to steale away the hearts of subiects, from their allegiance, haue beene brought by our Iosuah, into the valley of Achor, there to suffer condigne punishmēt, some by execution, some by banishment, some by confiscation of goods, with this iust sentence from Iosuah, of their death and doome.

               The craft of the Gibeonites procuredIosua. 9. 4. &c. them peace with Iosuah, they beguiled their Prince, with the presence of an Embassage from farre, and with an argument of their loue to God, & loyaltie to him, for they say, wee came from farre, we are thy seruants, we seeke the Lord thy God, and haue heard his fame: Now therfore make a league with vs, looke vpon vs, we come from far, our sacks are patched, our shooes are clouted, our bottles are rent, & bound vp, our bread is mouled, our drink is sowred, and we are all of the olde. Loue is not suspitious, it beleeueth1. Cor. 13. 7. all things, it hopeth all things. It endureth all things, it knoweth not it owne. The Gibeonites of this Lande haue beguiled Queene Elizabeth with a faire presence of loue to God, and loyaltie to her person, and with their patched cloake of Antiquitie, Clouted shooes, and Bottles, mouled bread, and baggage of popish trash, they would beguile, and still beare the worlde in hand, that they are all of the oulde, and so they are in rottennesse, rotten hearts to God, rotten hearts to their Prince, as may appeare vpon the breach of couenant with our Iosuah: Euen this day they

should hew wood for the sacrifice, but their Axes are dull: they should drawe water for the house of the Lorde, but their buckets are broken: they should attend the Altar of the Lord, but they haue digged it vp: Our Iosuah hath giuen them life vpon the contracte, and put them neare, and about the holie things, and is it not strange, vppon fourtie yeares kinde vsage, they should haue no greater familiaritie with their God and Prince? no wood, no water, no Altar, no prayer to God, of all this long day of Iosuah, so continued, and so blessed for her preseruation? what none? why then: Hee that is filthie? let him bee filthie still: Hee that is Popish, let him bee Popish still; and whiles yee would seeme to beguile vsReuel. 22. 11. with your Antichristian Antiquitie, wee will rest vpon our New-Religion, and say, Antiquitas nostra Christus; ours is not new, but renewed, like the booke of God, for a long time lost, but found at last, by the good King Iosias, and wee sing, as it were▪

            Lastly, and to make good my text, Iosua, as I haue said, was thrise noble, in that hee preuailed with God, to cammaund the

creatures, till the field was foughten, and their enemies were subdued. That Mirabilis annus of 88. will neuer be forgotten, so long as the sunne, and moone endureth, When the starres fought for our Deborah,
               Iudg. 5. 20. &c. as the sunne and moone did then for Iosua. Nay more, the riuer Kison swept them away from Callis in France, to Dingle-Cushe in Ireland, Seas, Rockes, and shelues fought for England, shee armed her selfe with praiers to God against that great Armado, and preuailed, that the enemiesEsay. 31. 3. &c. might know they were men, and not God: and their horses flesh and not spirit; That the shippes were but wood, the tacklings but hempe; Their Oares but reeds, and their powder but dust, nay their topgallant must stoope at the maiestie of a greater God, and vaile at the puissance of Queene Elizabeth.
            
            Let Tilberie Campe speake to the praise of her presence, and powerfull praier there, when with God in her heart, and a commaunding staffe in her hand, she vttered these, or the like words in her Princely march.
            
               Come on now my companions at armes, and
               
               fellow Souldiers, in the field, now for the Lord, for your Queene, and for the kingdome, for what are these proud Philistines, that they should reuile the Hoast of the liuing God? I haue beene your Prince in peace, so will I be in warre, neither will I bid you goe and fight, but come and let vs fight the battell of the Lord, the enemie perhaps may challenge my sexe for that I am a woman, so may I likewise charge their mould for that they are but men, whose breath is in their nostrels, and if God doe not charge England with the sinnes of England, little doe I feare their force, we commend your prayers, for they will moue the heauens, so doe wee your powerfull preaching, for that will shake the earth of our earthly hearts, and call vs to repentance, whereby our good God may relieue vs, and roote vp in mercy his deserued Iudgements intended against vs, onely be faithfull and feare not. Si deus nobiscum quis contra nos?
            
            And thus shee went on in her holy march, with her Princely power, spirit, and praier against that inuincible Nauie for preparation, might, and bloodie designes, the greatest and most fearefull that euer

was intended any nation.
            For as Emanuel van Meteran reporteth, their shippes were an hundred & fiftie, furnished with eight thousand mariners, besides of slaues for the Gallies, two thousād, eightie eight, of Souldiers twentie thousand, besides noble men, and gentlemen, voluntaries, they had great cast peeces 2650. peeces of brasen ordinance 1600. of Iron 1000. bullets 120000. gunpowder 5600. quitals, of match 1200. quintals, Muskets and Calliuers

Allen the great Apostle of our English Catholiques, to lye alooffe, with a Frye of Seminaries and Iesuites, vermine of our Church, to poyson within, & corrode the very bowels of their dearest countrey.

Nay more, if Dauid vpon2. Sam. 1. 24. the death of Saule, might thus mourne his funerals▪ & say, ye daughters of Israel weepe for Saule, who clothed you in scarlet, with1.

            And now the rather to prouoke the Lord that hee would continue still the blessings we enioy for Englands saftie, and his owne glory, you haue done well to honour this day with your presence, and to sanctifie yet with your prayer the day, that it might still dawne, the Prince that shee might still liue, and your selues be euer blessed vnder so happie a raigne, and gouernment.
            With whose bright beautie, that youCant. 4. 9. might be enamoured the more, & as it were wounded in loue with one of her eyes: and with a chaine of her necke, I haue thought good to match her in her princely pietie, with good Ezechia, one of the best Kings of Israels Iuda.
            
            His princely heart was replenished with foure religious vertues, more precious thē the Carbuncle,

               Now the chaine of his gouernment held by these foure lincks, all religious vertues fit for a Prince, and as it were, synewes of a sanctified state.
            The first was his faith, and kingly1 confidēce in his God, for so saith the text. Hee trusted in the LORD GOD of Israel.
            
            The second was his princely magnanimitie,2 euer contending with the best of his rancke, for after him there was none like him, neither were there any such before him.
            The third was his constancie, for hee3 claue to the Lord, and departed not from him.
            The fourth and last was the patterne of4 all his pietie, for he kept the commaundements which the Lord God commanded Moses.
            
            And all these vertues flowed from him like the riuers of Eden out of the Paradise of God, to water and refresh the dying; and declining plants of Iudah, which Ahaz his father had shaken with a dangerous2. Kings 16. 2. 3. 4. and Idolatrous rule.

            Againe, it is of due regard in this good King to perfect his praise in the full affiance he euer had in his God, that he did acknowledge him both God, and Lord, for so it is here saide, hee trusted in the Lord GodIo. 20. 28. of Israel, Lord of heauen, and Lord of the earth, Lord of life, and Lord of death, Lord of Israel, where hee was King and Lord of the nations, hee was to subdue; yea and his Lord too (though hee were a King) as to whom he ought both faith and fealtie, with a limited subiection of all his power, to his blessed will, and soueraigne command, and therefore it was not without cause Dauid ended his Psalme with this beatitude.

            Sound it in a true sense, & with a sanctified soule, and you shall finde that lacke of consideration in this very point of pietie, is, and hath beene, the breeder of all Atheisme, mischiefe, and wickednesse in this woful world, the Angels had kept theirIud. 6. first estate, if they had made their God their Lord, Adam and Eue his fairest creatures had neuer fallen so farre, had they not failed in their obedience to that Lord, that was their God, Israel played the harlot vnderEsay 5. 7. 15. euery greene tree, shee was disloyall to her Lord, and therefore no maruell if they went into Captiuitie, when their God was not their Lord.

Our secret Idolatries, and open stealth, our gnawing vsuries, and extrauagant lusts of the flesh, our excessiue auarice, and grieuous oppressions, our contempt of the word, Sacraments, and Sabaoths, our generall Apostasie from all good, and godlines, with our lewde liues led by no rule, shew that wee are irregular, dead to God, and fallen from all obedience to our Lord,

wee doe not trust in the Lord God of Israel

Chro. 28. 24. shut vp, he opened them in the first yeare, and in the first moneth of his raigne, and repaired them. Queene Elizabeth deferred no time, to establish Religion, but opened the doores of the Lords house, euen in the first yeare, first moneth, and first day of her raigne, procuring the Lord to be honoured aright with the pure Religion of

her God, and a parliament Royall to establish the same.

Ezekia at the very first tooke away2. Kings. 18. 4. the high places, and defaced the Images, and cut downe the groaues, hee brake in peeces the brasen serpent, that Moses had made (for vnto those daies the children of Israel did burne incense to it) and called it in contempt of that their Idolatry no more a Serpent, but Nehushtan, a peece of brasse. What were your Altars of stone but high places? And what were your Roode loftes, Celles, and shrines of Saints, but groaues of superstition? what was all your Imagetie, with lights, lampes, Pax, and palmes, but grosse Idolatrie? & whereunto England burned incense

to the Queene of heauen till Elizabeth came, but then euen at the first downe they went: and broke they were by her princely power, and warrantie, the careasses whereof lye at this day, monuments of popissi Idolatry, and of her maiesties blessed reformation with this disdaine, what are they now but stick and stone, and worse then Nehushtan, brused brasse?

               Ezechia came to his raigne in desperate times, when Ahaz his father had peruerted the state both of Church and common-weale, fetched Altars from Damascus, and sacrificed his sonnes to the fire,1. Kings 6. 34. became tributarie vnto Assur, exiled the

godly of Iudah, and had brought in the abhominations of Babel, and subscribed to Tiglath Pilesar, King of Assur, saying, I am thy seruant and thy Sonne.
            
            Euen so, Queene Elizabeth beganne her raigne in desperate times, when her Sister had shaken the State, with no lesse fearefull then fiery designes, fetched Altars from Rome, and sacrificed her chiefest subiects to the fire, exiled the godlie of the land, brought in Straungers, because a vassall to the Pope, and subscribed to his power, saying: I am thy Seruant, I am thy Hand-mayde.
            
            
               Ezechiah withstood Assur, payed him2. Kings▪ 18. & 89. no tribute, yeelded him no homage, resisted Rabsechah, and endured his rayling, with a Princely patience, committting the successe to God, who made him glorious by deliuerance.
            And did not our gratious soueraigne withstand the Pope, & all his vassall Kings? Did she not discharge herselfe and people of all Tribute, Toll, and Taxe, that way?
            Hath shee not endured the raylings of many Romish Rabsecahes, with a Princelie patience? and hauing committed the

successe of all her affaires to God, is sheePs. 149. 4. not made glorious by deliuerance, whiles they are a dead, accursed, and cursing crue, and yet she liueth a blessed Queene, long may we say to our solace, and their sorrow,Dan. 6. 21 liue, liue.
            It is said of Ezechia, that the Lord saued2. Chron. 32. 22. him, and the inhabitants of Hierusalem, from the hand of Zenacharib, King of Assur: and from the handes of all other, and maintained them on euery side, good LORD how haue the Leaguers cast their hands together with one consent, & consederate against thine annointed, thy ChurchPsal. 83. 3 and people in England, Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalecke, the Philistimes, with them that dwell at Tyre, I meane the Tabernacles of Romish Edomites, whose crie was downePs. 137. 7. with it, downe with it, euen to the ground, let vs take to our selues the house of God in possession.

            In the daies of Hezechia it is saide, that many brought offerings vnto the LORD

               Hierusalem, and presents to Hezechia,
               2. Chron. 32. 23. King of Iuda, so that hee was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth, they persecuted Churches of other Kingdomes, and poore exiled Christians, let them speake to the comfort of their soules, with how great ioy and gladnesse, their offerings here in England haue beene tendered by them, and receiued by vs, let them speake to the honour of our Queene and countrey, how liberally they haue bin maintained, when they hadde nothing to feede vpon, but winde and aire, yea and what nation is there, in whose sight Queene Elizabeth is not magnified, & either dread for her puissance, loued for her vertue, or admired for her gouernment?
            To bee briefe, Ezechia had exceeding2. Chron. 32. 27. 28 much riches, & honour, treasures, of siluer and gold, of precious stones, of sweet odors, and of shields, & of al pleasant vessels, storehouses for the increase of wheate, wine, and oyle, stals for all beasts, and ranges for the stables.
            
               The Lord hath blessed our Queene with his hidden treasures here on earth, and her honor is great in her aboundance, her Garrisons are full in Ireland, Flaunders, and Barwick, and yet her treasures are not exh

            Lastly, and so an ende of her praise, but neuer of our praier to GOD for her. Ezechia
               Esay 38. 1 was sicke vnto the death, hee prayed vnto the Lord, and hee heard his prayers, and pitied his teares, and the Lord spake comfortably vnto him, and gaue him a signe of his recouerie, by the going backe of the shadowe of Asa his diall tenne degrees vpon the wall. A sure symboll or Sacrament of fifteene yeares moe to bee added vnto his daies.
            Where note first I pray you, that the promise from God was fifteene: and the degrees were but tenne, to teach vs (as one hath truely obserued) that the Lord euer

giueth moe graces vnto his word, then to his Sacraments, that begettting, these but confirming the faith, which the word hath formerly be gotten.
            But to the comparison in hand and proiect I ay me at, wee knowe that PrincesPs. 82. 6. 7 are GODS: yet must they dye like men, there's no difference in the moulde: from the rich Crowne of Kings, to the poore beggars crutch, all must grinde to greete, and to determine of the life of Kings, and period of Kingdomes, is not the least of Gods secretes onely reserued to himselfe, yet if when it shall please the Lord to touch our dread soueraigne with sicknesse, the harbenger of death, it would likewise please him to pull backe the diall of her dayes some fewe degrees, and adde more yeares vnto her dayes, it were, and would be as great a blessing to vs of England, as euer Hezechia his life was to Israels Iuda: which and if it may not by reason our manyProu. 28. 2. sins, then Lord take her to eternitie neuer to dye.
            And in the meane time, whilest wee may enioy her blessed raigne, with her life,

let vs foster and cherish Elizabeth: as chaste Abishagge, with the worthies of Israel, did their Dauid, of whom it is written1. Kings. 1. 1. that when he was old & stricken in yeares, they couered him with clothes, but no heate came vnto him, The counsell was to finde out a fairer virgin to stand before the King, to chearish him, and lie in his bosome, that the King might get beate, so they found one Abyshag a Sunamite, and brought her to the King, the maide was exceeding faire, and cherished the King and ministred vnto him, but the King knew her not.
            The vse is good, for in the person of Dauid, you may behold (as in a mirrour) the state and condition of Princes, what it is: Princes are old, cold and chillery, PrincesPsal. 82. 6. 7. must decay, and weare away.
            In the person of Dauids seruants, and faire Abishage, is to be seene the loue and loyaltie towards their Soueraignes, what it ought to be, they stretch their wits to aduise & practise with all their power, how to preserue the Lords annoynted, subiects must be carefull of their King.
            The publike and priuate praier of all the

land, who owe faith to God, and fealtie to their Prince, all praise, and prophecie this day, what is it but chaste and faire Abishage, found out to foster their liege Lady, the Queene, to stand before her, chearish, and lie in her bosome, to get her heate, and lengthen her life, but oh that our praiers were more powerfull, yet to preuaile with the Lord of life, that she might liue to his glory, and our comfort, sweete Sunamyte let thy virginall vigor pierce her vaines, warme her blood, refresh her spirits, Lord let the powerfull praier of priest, Peere and people preuaile with their God, for the safetie of his annoynted.
            Without which it is to small purpose what euer we can say, doe, or deuise, for whats pollicie without pietie, except thePsal. 127. 12. Lord keepe the citie, the watchman watcheth but in vaine, and except the Lord be her guard great is her danger, for all humane succours faile in their greatnes, no gold of Ophir, no Orient pearle of Peru, orIer. 17. 5. 
               Mexico, no arme of flesh, no horse, ship or shower of shot, no watch, guard, or counsel, no Physicke, drink, or diet, no furs of spotted Ermynes, or sweet Sables, can preserue

your Elizabeth, giue her life or length of daies, faire Abishage must giue her heate. It is the perfume of our praier to God in heauen: that must preserue our Prince on earth. And so let vs pray, O Lord God almightie, &c.
