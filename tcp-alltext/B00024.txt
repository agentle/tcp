               To the tune of the Spaniſh Ipſie.
               
            
            
               
            
            
               COme follow, follow all,
               'Tis Engliſh Iipſies call;
               All you that loue your liues,
               Heres thoſe for profit ſtriues.
               We fare well when thouſands lacke,
               None of vs can credits cracke.
               
                  We fare well, &c.
               
            
            
               If we to Gallants come,
               The country people run
               To ſee what we can doe,
               Much paines they vndergoe:
               Seriouſly a number ſtriues
               To lead the Engliſh Iipſies liues.
               
                  Seriouſly a number, &c.
               
            
            
               We humor none that liues,
               Nor hate no man that giues,
               Ambition doth not reſt
               Ith' Engliſh Iipſies breſt:
               If they giue, weele willing take,
               Nought that's good will we forſake.
            
            
               We vſe all things are quaint,
               With Painters we can paint;
               Our dye is not in vaine,
               For we doe dye in graine:
               The Walnut trée ſupplies our lacke,
               what was made faire, we can make black.
            
            
               We take a formall courſe,
               Some ſixe vpon a Horſe
               We ſingle ſcorne to ride,
               Our horſe doth want no guide:
               We by turnes will take our eaſe,
               And liue all humors for to pleaſe.
            
            
               We ſcorne for to entiſe
               With beauty Gallants eyes,
               We beare no beautious face,
               Our ſubtile ſlightes to grace,
               We can paint when we command,
               And looke like Indians that are 
                     •
                  and.
            
            
               We practiſe not to dance,
               Nor learne no tunes from France,
               
               Our Knackers make no noiſe,
               We are no roaring Boyes;
               Engliſh Iipſies all liue free,
               And loue, and liue moſt iouially.
            
            
               Our fare is of the beſt,
               Thrée times a wéeke we feaſt,
               Nay ſometime euery day,
               And yet for nothing pay:
               For, Béefe or Bacon, Géeſe or Hens,
               What we eate is other mens.
            
            
               Sometimes where great men dwell,
               We doe there Fortunes tell,
               Our paines for to requite,
               We diet there all night:
               In this life we ſpend our dayes,
               Engliſh Iipſies Lawes obayes.
            
            
               
               
               The ſecond Part.
               To the ſame tune.
               
                  
               
               
                  VVE feare to wrong the Law,
                  We liue in ſeruile awe,
                  Yet whereſoere we goe,
                  We ſeldome find a foe:
                  Whereſoere we come, we find
                  For one that hates, an hundred kind,
               
               
                  Pleaſure we haue ſtore,
                  Who can deſire more,
                  All doth our paines requite,
                  Then frolike we all night,
                  Mongſt our ſelues we dance and ſing,
                  Night content to vs doth bring.
               
               
                  What'ere we get all day,
                  That night doth fly away,
                  We hoord not vp our ſtore,
                  For next day we haue more,
                  Feaſt our ſelues with gallant Chéere,
                  Spare no coſt for wine or béere.
               
               
                  To drinke, be drunke, and tipſie,
                  Delights the Engliſh Iipſie:
                  we liue to loue all thoſe
                  That are no Iipſies foes:
                  Some decay'd mongſt Gallants, ſtriues
                  To leade the Engliſh Iipſies liues.
               
               
                  We beare this honeſt mind,
                  To loue all friends are kind
                  Our foes we can requite,
                  with hatred and deſpight:
                  For we can plague our mortall foe,
                  Yet he the actors neuer know.
               
               
                  Great ſtore of Coyne we gaine,
                  Yet for it take no paine:
                  Our diet's ſeldome ſought,
                  For it is to vs brought,
                  Pigs or Géeſe, or Brawne or Sowſe,
                  Or any meat that's in the houſe.
               
               
                  Ther's many ſtand in feare,
                  when we approach but néere,
                  Sometimes our very ſight
                  The children doth affright:
                  Our names are ſpred both far and néere,
                  Our friends we loue, but dread no feare,
               
               
                  We hate all ſurly ſlaues,
                  Nor loue on cunning knaues,
                  Our ſelues can cunning vſe,
                  Yet none we will abuſe:
                  He that freely giues, ſhall find
                  The Engliſh Iipſies alwaies kind,
               
               
                  Who ere hath bin in Spaine,
                  
                  And ſéene there Iipſies vaine,
                  Shall ſoone the difference find,
                  Elſe iudgement makes him blind:
                  So Spaniſh Iipſies all adue,
                  For Engliſh equall are to you.
                  
                     So Spaniſh Iipſies, &c.
                  
               
            
            FINIS.
