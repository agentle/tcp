               GEntlemen, after many of mine owne labours that you haue courteouslie accepted, I present you with Euphues shadowe, in the behalfe of my absent friend M. Thomas Lodge, who at his departure to sea vpon a long voyage, was willing, as a generall farewell to all courteous Gentlemen, to leaue this his worke to the view, which if you grace with your fauours eyther as his affected meaning, or the worthe of the worke requires, not onely I for him shall rest yours, but what laboures his sea studies affords, shall be I dare promise, offered to your sight, to gratifie your courtesies, and his pen as himselfe, euery waye yours for euer Farewell.

            Philautus, to his Sonnes liuing at the Courte.
            
               NOwe my good Sonnes, that the ripenesse of your yeares makes you ready for fortune, and the place of your present aboade, is the Theater of hir tragedies, least by making a simpathie betweene Will and Wit, your rashness in youth might breede repentance in age, I haue amidst the fatherlesse cares of your welfare, shapen out Euphues Shadow, by the substance of his first youth, limming out vnder the figure of Philamis, the fortunes of Euphues, wherin yon shall see, that young mens first wits are like Aprill dewes which breede more vnwholsome weedes then profitable flowers: Euphues was my friend in his life, and kinde to you by his legacie at his death: but he tooke more paines to write it, then you pleasure to followe it, els had I heard you had b

Therefore I send you his Shadowe, conteyning the substance of his young desire, read it, and followe it, and then I hope you wyll saye, the shadowe of my dead friend, bred you the substance of many honourable vertues. Farewell.

               AT such time as Octauius possessed the mouarchy of the whole world, and Rome the maiestie of all wealth and wisedome: there dwelt at Rauenna (a famous Citie in Italie) a yong Gentleman, who had as great reach in wit as riches, and as many perfections, as possessions, beautifull hee was, and this was natures benefit: rich he was, and that Fortunes bequest, in breefe: Nature and Fortune (striuing to exceede each other) strained so farre, as Fortune could impart no more wealth, nor Nature no more woorth. But as the Beast Varius hath a ritch skin, but a ranke flesh, and the birde Struchio a big body, but weake wings, so Philamis hauing a rype wit had a running head, placing his felicitie in trauaile, not in temperance, in seeking forraine countries, not hearing fruitfull counsailes, for which cause, gathering together much wealth, and neglecting his welfare, forsaking his friends to trust to forrainers, after he had trauailed many countries, hee entered into Austria: This prouince (among all other) is pleasant and plentifull, inritched with fruitfull mould, and replen

                        Anthenors Item, to all young Gentlemen.
                        
                        
                           THe retchlesse race of youths inconstant course,
                           (Which weeping age with sorowing teares behoulds)
                           Their wretched will (their wofull sorrows source)
                           Their wanton wits, their errors manifoldes
                           Hath reard my muse, whose springs wan care had dried,
                           To name them flie the dangers I haue tried.
                        
                        
                           From Cradles rock, when childish I had crept,
                           And May-like young, of pleasure gan to taste,
                           Seeing my fatall course my reason wepte,
                           Toyes were my triumphes, will my woorth did waste,
                           And in the seas of pleasure whilst I sayld,
                           Small were my fruits, and yet my youth was quailde.
                        
                        
                           And now gan manlike vigor fill wyne arme,
                           My hart was warmde with courage fit for loue:
                           Like wanton bird exempt from fowlers charme,
                           I soard aloft but looking from aboue.
                           I saw on earth a Fowler heauenly faire,
                           That made hir nets the trammels of hir haire.
                        
                        
                           Then loe my pompuous plumes were layd a part,
                           Hir eyes were loadestars in this worldlie way,
                           My thoughts hir thraule, hir prisoner was my heart,
                           But for my paines, what payment but delay.
                           A lingring life I liude to sorrow soulde,
                           A foe to wit through follies waxing oulde.
                        
                        
                           When chillie age had seasure of this earth,
                           
                              I felt a wound of sorrow in my brest,
                           I saw how iudgement quite was spoild by dearth.
                           How vertues seedes by errors was supprest.
                           I cast the count, and see what I haue gotten:
                           Timelost, wits wast, and limmes with surfets rotten.
                        
                        
                           Now see I well that trauell is mispent,
                           Except in vertue it be well imployed,
                           What I in loue had I in learning spent,
                           Oh what a ioy had we arie age enioyed?
                           Had I foreseene the wastfull course of time,
                           I then had made my haruest in my prime.
                        
                        
                           But now when feeble footsteps are allied,
                           Vnto the graue this sinfull bodies hould:
                           I cannot practise though I haue espyed.
                           The way of worth, the grace exceeding gould.
                           What only rests sweete young men that shall follow,
                           I know the sourse and now will teach the shallow.
                        
                        
                           Preuent the time the dayes are full of danger,
                           Whilst youthfull vigor yeelds you furtherance,
                           Make reason guide, let follie be a straunger,
                           Vertue is perfected by art and vsance.
                           Enritch your mindes with skill, for why they must,
                           Remaine eterne when boddie is but dust.
                        
                        
                           Let not your eyes infeebled be by sinne,
                           Cut short presumption for it will aspire:
                           Who takes aduice, amendment dooth begin,

                           A dorne the boddie, minde, and inward partes.
                        
                        
                           These lines are lines like Ariadnes clewe,
                           To leade thee through the Laborinth of greefe:
                           Who so thou be that vertue wilt ensew,
                           
                              More sweete in sooth then show in true releefe,

                           Least you repent with me when you are ould.
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            In this sort Anthenor councelled his countrey meu warning them by his experience to preuent their youthlie negligence, but Philamis not perceiuing, that the rotten wood which glistereth in the night is gray and drye in the day time: that delights which are faire in showe, are foule in substance, that things which are best in apparance are woorst in proofe, followed his

               uld course, and defaulted in his youthfull inconstancie, thinking that the tide would haue no ebbe, the time would haue no ende. Among all such as conuersed with him, there was a young Gentleman of the same yeares, and no lesse substance, called Philamour, who cyther for that he agreed in nature with Philamis, or for that necessitie would haue it so: entered an inuiolable league of amitie with the braue Rauennois, these couple counited by vowes, and vnited by loue, lyued together in such manner, that if Philamis sighed, Philamour was sorrie, if Philamour was pleasant, Philamis was not pensiue: if Phllamis would mourne, Philamour was melancholie: if Philamour passionate for loue, Philamis was loues patient: what Philamis said, Philamour would sooth: what Philamour intended, Philamis ended: so that neither Eurialus was more deere to his Nisus, nor Caesar to Cicero: nor Ephestion to Alexander: nor Lucilius to Seneca, then Phil

               ortune: this Ladye was beautifull beyond woonder', and more wittie then wealthie: hir bodye was adorned with the guiftes of nature, (hauing eyes as faire as the Carbuncle, but more cleerer: Cheekes more crimson then the Rose, but sweeter: Lippes Cherrieripe: limmes choicely framed,) her minde with staied iudgement: reddy thoughts, pleasant conceits, perfect constancie: treasure enough to intangle the eye, riches sufficient to rauishe the soule. These perfections had so much power ouer Philamour, that he tooke no other comfort but in hir company, her eye was his Idol, her wordes were his Oracles, so that he seemed to confesse with Alexis, that loue was the infallible mistresse of men, killing all former pleasures in them, planting theyr delight on one onely obiect, which the more a man seeth, the more he seeketh, neither was young Philamis vnattainted. (But in contrarie sort) for Harpaste behoulding his hautye lookes, his honourable learning, his braue discourse, his boulde demeanour, his Socraticall questions, his Iudiciall aunswers: began to catche houlde where there was no handle, to kindle Fuell where there was no Fier, and to beginne hir loue where there was no lyking. This entrance made Fortune to manifest troubles, making this her induction to most tyrannicall cruelties: for the more Philamour courted Harpaste, the more she contemned him: the more Harpaste laboured to allure Philamis, the more Philamis neglected the loue of Harpaste.
            
            Manye were the presents on both sides, many the perswations, many the priuie sighes to importe fancie: manye the apparant shewes of vnfayned fauour, if Philamour complayned hee found no comforte, if Harpaste bemooned hir, shee fo

            Euery one in the companie was delighted with this dittie, onely Harpaste counted all stringes out of tune, since hir heart stringes were out of temper, notwithstanding to shew her selfe courtelie, though somewhat discontented, she answered expectation with action, not speech: vouchsafing him a Basolos manos, for his melodie and martirdome. After all these Bargincts and Madrigales were daunced, according to the custome of Austria, the Ladyes called for a Basket, wherein euery Gentleman and Gentlewoman casting their Gloues, there was election made who should be Kings and Queenes, the lottes cast: Philamis was appointed King, and Harpaste Queene, who by order ought to preferre some question whereon the company should dispute: and which they should decide, the Rauennois therefore vouchsafing the place, and incited to the performance, began thus, When Midas was made Judge faire Ladyes, Apollo had the woorst:

homlie wits cannot decide heauenly doubts, and better were it to giue ouer with ignorance, then to be presumptuo

The Lapidarie layeth the foyle before he setteth the stone: The Dier washeth the cloath before he stayneth the coulour, the Mason squareth his plot before he layeth his foundation: so am I but the entrance to iudgement, she the essence, she the substance I the cipher, hauing this onely happinesse to speake with her, which of her selfe onelie speaketh well: Harpaste blushed at this praise, taking the commendation most kindlie at his handes, from whom she expected most comfort, and sodainly had shee yeelded him replye, but that Philamis fearing least the wounde should be stung with too many Nettles, began thus. Since I am to propone the question, and you to decide the quarrell, (faire Ladyes and braue Gentlemen) let it bee this: Whether it bee better to deserue and haue no friendship, or offend and finde fauour: A matter incident to the time, and accordant to the persons: and since Eurinome is cheefest in woorth, and choisest in wisddme, I will if so my Queene condiscend, that she begin the controuersie, Harpaste that liked the clawse, quicklye subscribed: Wherevpon after some attention: disdainfull Eurinome began thus. Since I am charged by those who may commaund, and peremptorinesse is greater offence then ignorance, I will vtter my opinion meo Iure, yet conclude all things with reuerence, and salua authoritate.

with a trammell, to charme the haire with a tabor, to couple the Cinick with the Stoick, or the Snayle with the Storke, for women are like quailes not charmed without a sweete call, like Dolphins not allured but by musick, and shew of obsernance towards them, is the best meanes to be soueraignes ouer them: but

rude repulses, suffered with content, sustained without contempt, is not this desart? To be rewarded with cruelty for curtesie, to returne fauours for frumpes, praises for displeasures, is not this desert: To esteeme all dangers dutie, all torments trifles, all penance pleasure, is not this desart: and are not all these troubles: being rewarded with vndeserued torment: which though among liuing men they are counted vaine, among louing men are helde for vertuous: for as the Pecocke hath fairest coulors about the crest, the Doue choisest feath

For as without the mixture of light nothing is cleere, and nothing darke but that which hath darkenesse: as without the aide of fire nothing is hot, nor without the assistance of aire could, so without trouble in loue there is no triumph, without repulses no pleasures, without sower

            How likes your Maiestie of this Orator? hath he not preached well?

In breefe I may bouldly say with Tully, that this man hath not onely surmounted the glory of the best deseruers of this time, by his vertue, but also all the memories of antiquitie by his valew: But why praise I him, who perished by me? and why in reporting his excellence, rip I vp my owne insolence? ah Claetia this is nought els but to rubbe on the gall, to kick against the prick.

This noble Rabinus vnhappilie beheld me, and more vnfortunately loued me, leauing no practise vnattempted, no seruice vnperformed, whereby he might manifest his humilitie, or I be notified by humanitie. But as Eleborus healeth some madnesse, and maketh some more moodie: so his submission which might haue mortified the hearts of other, and molified the mindes of the floutest, made me more seuere: for like the steale hardned by much melting. I grew harde harted by his many wecpings, carrying in my lookes the poysen of Sardania, which maketh shewe of smiling, when there is shrowded greatest seueritie. Fiue yeares and more with importunate sutes did he solicite me, haunting continually the place of my habitation, thinking himselfe happy to kisse the Couslip wheron his Venus had troden, forced at last by his importunitie, and egged forward by mine owne pride, I vouchsafed him the oportunitie to discouer his affections, where after many lamentable complaints, with little compassion, he at last required this onely fauour, to kisse my hand, protesting any seruice to attaine to so great felicitie: wretched that I was, I wholy enclined to seueritie, returned him this aunswer: that at such time as he had atchieued three combates in honor of my name, slaine three monsters in Libia, and brought me three heads, and finally rid him of life that most troubled my delights, he should enioy his wishe, and show his worth: cruell that I was, ouer cruell that I was I not only tied him by words, but bound him by othes: & he more constant then aduised, preferring my loue before his owne life, prosecuted his pretence, neither agreeued at the impossibilitie of my demaunds, nor grut

Thus applied Rabinius al things according to his own cogitations, feeding onely on the roots of the desarts: & stanching his thrust with fountain water, at last after he had passed thorow a thick wood, he entred a shady plot of ground, in midst wherof there was placed a tombe of white marbel, on which sat a knight armed at assaye all saue his head, who espying Rabinus so mounted and addrest, betoke him to his horse? buckled his helme & drew neere him, saluting him in this sort.

Among the rest Tarpeia poore maide, is most miserable: for liuing in continuall feare, shee is hourelie affrighted with visions, sometimes with Tigers renting hir garments, in the night time with ghostes threatning Tragedies, so that neuer was there any since nature had power, that deserued lesse plague, or endureth more punishment: it were vaine for mee noble Signior, to tell all troubles, the teares of hir parents, the lament of the Peeres, how for hir all the Lordes are disconsolate, all the lande desolate, onelye I annex this, that who so setteth hir at libertie (which cannot be effected without great felicitie) may if he please be possessor of hir loue, and maister of hir liuing.

Ah Claetia, thy fauour is too high prised, that for the kisse of thy hand, crauest the bloud of my heart, yet let me kisse it Claetia, that I may spend my last breath on thy least beutie. Oh you Nobles, now gan I bow, but without benefit, my minde was to pitty when I had no meanes: the behoulders exclaimed, I cryed, and approching the chariot, sought all meanes possible to recouer his comfort: now bestowed I kisses on his wan cheekes, now imployed I wishes to restore his lost life. But ah the fruites of my folly, I pyned to see him perrish, who perrished thorow my peremptorines. But he (oh kinde Rabinus, sealing his loue with sweete sighes, opening his conceits with amiable kisses, since libertie of speech was reft him, bestowed that was left him, kinde lookes for my vnkinde loosenesse, and when I was most tyred with loue, he expired his last. The Knights behoulding his mishap, fled for horror, leauing me to lament him, whom my pride had lost.
                        Lord how comfortlesse laye I on hys course, how imbraced I him, whom I had imbaced, and hauing killed him with vnkindnesse in loue, how gladly would I with kindnesse haue kissed him aliue. But oh we weakelings of nature, but too waspish: not so waspish as wretched, nor so wretched as wicked, we melt not in desire, tyll men merrit by death: and are kinde when we cannot possesse, and cruell when we should pleasure, hys woorst was past, my wickednesse was apparant. To be breefe (for my breuity is now my benefit) who must heryte nothing but myne owne shame, I caused hys dead body to be conuayed into my Chamber, wherein I inclosed my selfe, acknowledging and vnworthy of comfort, still seeking counsell of the gods

how I might satisfie his ghost: tyll at last this later night, in my deepest sleepes I beheld this vision. Me thought my Rabinus bearing new bloudie woundes, stood by my bed side, and soddainly awaking, cryed out in this manner. Haste thee Claetia, bloud requireth bloud, my ghost will be satisfied, when thy lyfe is finished: as thou hast wronged me in the sight of the world, so satisfie me in the presence of many witnesses. This sayd he vanished, and I arose: where taking the Sworde wherewith he was guirded, and this Lampe whereby I was watched, I caused my traine of Damsels to draw forth his Coache, and hearing of your solemne assembly this day: I thought good to make you eye witnesses of my penitence: this sayd, she caused the damsels to draw in the chariot, driuing all the assistance into a maze, when extinguishing hit lampe, and casting hir selfe vpon the dead body of Rabinus, she pierced hir brest with his sword, and finished hir life with this answer. Ah kind friend, since I may not satisfie thee with my life, I wil sacrifice vnto thee in my death.

O Philamis, if it be possible to charme loue, why were these inchanted: if they were toucht in their excelence, why should I greeue to be tryed in my ignorance? who washeth the Asses eares, looseth both his Sope and his labour: who endeuoreth impossible things, mispendeth his cost and his candle: in disswading

            Thou condemnest Loue, seeking by a fewe shadowes of imperfection to extinguish the sweetnesse of pleasure. Oh my Philamis, thou canst not haue the effecte, but the defect followeth, neyther the honny in the Bee, but the pricke in the bum: beleeue mee, as it is rashnesse to condemne that which thou canst not determine. So in some thinges it is better to bee deceyued, than to distrust.

            But to leaue long discourse, since wordes haue no power to expresse true worthinesse, (my Philamis) know thou that I loue, neyther can I discharge mee of that thraldome, but by myne owne ouerthrowe: It behooueth thee therefore in louing mee, to styrre vp Harpastes loue towardes mee, otherwise, as thou vnderstandest not the least of my ieopardies, so shalt thou beholde the last of my ioyes.
            
               Philamis, that knewe the cloth by the lyst, the Lyon by his clawe, and the daunger by his discourse, replyed thus: Philamour, if thou were counselled by Democritus, more surer were thy comfort: for if thou desirest not much, a little would seeme vnto thee sufficient, but this thy longing appetyte beyond custome, threateneth thee wyth a daunger aboue conceipt, which I see it were better to lament than amende in thee.

Rise therfore and write, let me be the messenger to present, and the instrument to perswade, whereby thou shalt bring all things to such conformitie, that thou maist be assured of comfort: to sit lingring thus in thy bed, and lament thus against beautie, is rather the meanes to waste thy life, then win thy loue. Philamour in this sort being comforted by his deere freend Philamis, gathered his spirits together, and taking pen in hand began this perswasiue letter.

But (oh thou milde in behauiour, and Marble in heart: comely in demeanour, but careles of my duties) as the balme tree shunneth the stresse of the Iron, so thy brest shaketh of the sting of amitie: and like the retchlesse patient, the more thou art medicined, the lesse art thou mortified.

I would I had not, said Harpaste, so you had lost your labour: houlde take this Libell and carrie it to your Lawyer: wherein he shall finde I except so much, that I accept nothing. Philamis troubled with this gleeke, began in this sorte once againe to rub vppon the gall: Why my Harpaste, I had well hoped that Philamours desert should deserue more pittie then impatience: what he deserues sayd she, he may deuine by my sentence, as for your selfe, if you haue sutes of your owne, you were best follow them, for beleeue me his is non suited. I but madame replyed Philamis, shall he not be welcome to the buriall? Welcome sayd Harpaste? belecue me none better, I had rather waight on his burials then bridals, and so tell him. Herewith all with a disdainfull blushe, she soddainlye forsooke his company, and Philamis departed thence wholye discontent. And as wretched fortune would, hee passed by Eurimones doore, at such time as in hir greatest triumph she sat to showe hir selfe, expecting to giue some due to some one of hir L

               Eurimone like a cunning fowler, seeing the bird alreadie pend in the snare, began in this sort to play with his feathers. Why Philamis I am sure you are too learned to loue, which is a sicknesse of the mind, a surfet of idlenessc. Beleeue nice I know you mocke Loue, for you cannot meane not Loue. May it bee thought that a man who writes so well, should doate so soone

               Philamis seeing her impatience replyed thus. If my sunplicitie shoulde bee taken for subtiltie, and my deuotion for doublenes: beleeue mee Eurimone, I had rather die than speake any thing, and perish ere I would perswade: but since Loue (as Garimbert saith) surmounteth the fortresse of the spirit, carueth the hard Diamonds, warmeth the cold I sicles that often lie hidden in the brestes of delicate Ladies: I will speake in that hope, and vow that I auow nothing but truth. Plato hauing long time lead a chast life, finally in his latter dayes made his sacrifice to satisfie and appease nature, in that he seemed greatly to haue offended her, by his seuere chastitie: time lost in loue is the lame time of our life, and Ladyes that loath when they arc wisht, are soonest lefte when they would. Ah Eurimone, thou art yoong, and must be yeelding: thou art a saire rose, and must be gathered: a pretty bud, and must be plucked: thou art fitte for mans meat, and meete for marriage: which (since in a

            Alas (he sayde) iniurious sexe, giuen ouer to subtiltie, who with the vayle of honest occasion couer the dishonestie of your spirits, I cannot lament your follyes so much, as be discontented with your falshood: you are plyant when you are not not pursued, and fawne when you are most flattered: Oh viperous brood full of vices, who in your greatest calmes lyke

But whither now Philamis? Shall men condenm them in their wickednes, when they are themselues wretched? What is man but a minde incarnate? a fantasie of time? a beholder of life? a manciple of death? a walker going? a dweller of place? a laborious mind subiect to passion, being as subiect to bee seduced, as women are sub

The potion that poysoneth is not to be blamed, but he that presenteth it: and our defaults are not to be ascribed to them, but our owne follyes. Thy Idlenes Philamis, I there is the nurse of this same, and the seale of thine incontinence: Studie is the preseruanue of such vnstaiednes, where the eye beholding good things is not besotted with euill, and the eare that harboureth science, is stopped to the Syren. Blame not them therefore who are the weaker creatures, but thy selfe which was so ill councelled. In this manner ceased Philamis to complayne, and beganne to contemplate, resoluing with himselfe wholly to intend the succour of h

Thus parting both of them out of the Citie, and walking along the bankes of Danubius, Philamis knowing with Menander that the enuious is enemy to himselfe, in that his spirit combats continually in contrary passions, hauing the greater iudgement, shewed the more moderation, and taking Philamour by th

Naucrates a man of great wisdome, was wont to say, that the cholorike men resembled lampes, which the more oyle they haue, the more they are inflamed: for as the more the one gathers fire, the more the other groweth furious. It is therfore wisdome to temper this violent passion of the mind, which in Caius Caesar had such superioritie, that he was incensed against a cittie, & in Cirus, that he waxed wroth with a riuer: least herein we shew our selues bruter thā beasts who are by nature taught to temper their fury, when they haue aslaked their hunger, following the lenitie of Antigonus, of whom Seneca maketh mention, who rather releeued than grieued his rebellious bondmen, pulling them out of the durt, not casting them in the dust.

                           For why contempt is answered with dispight,
                           Remembring still this sentence sage and ould:
                           Who will not yonge, they may not when they would.
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            Contrariwise Harpaste with more moderation; kept Philamis in remembrance, gouerning bir affections with such a raigne, that though inwardly she felt the wound, yet outwardly no one could perceiue the scar or showe of scath. Such gouernment had she ouer hir fancies, as Curio had in entertaining temporall fortunes, who being presented by the Samnits with great sums of gould, laughed hartely, returning this constant answer. Go you embassadors and tell the Samnites that Curio desireth rather to rule them that haue possession of gould, then to haue gould: and that neither money shall corrupt me, nor dread of mine enemies confound me. So was Harpaste as Curio, moderate, but not with like meane: for as the one fancied not wealth, so the other was fond of loue: yet in that Harpaste being a woman couloured so well, she may be compared with Curio for constancie.
            But leauing these in Passan, returne we to Philamour: many and emment daungers passed he, being subiect to the mercie of the seas, and furie of the wind: now vndertooke he trauell through vnknowne deserts, fearing leaft P

Strange were it to rip vp his discontented passions, for feare to mooue Ladies patience, who are neuer more sweeter then when they smile, and when they are mooued none more mournefull, resembling the qualitie of Euphrates, which is neuer more comelie then when it is calme: nor no wayes so terrible as when it is troubled, for as the one is tossed with the least winde: so is the other tempted

by the least word. In short he arriued in Rauenna, making such inquisitiue search after his friend, that the most part who resolued on Philamis death, accused him of follie, and entering his house, which was of no small accoumpt, he vsed the same ceremonie which the Indian Princes haue in theyr pillars, who honour the bodyes and pictures of theyr dead parents, for finding the portrature of Philamis drawne, hanging at his bed chamber, he fell downe before it, making such pittiful lamentation, as neither th

            Now imbraced he the shadowe like Pigmalions image, powring such store of teares ouer the sencelesse image, that if anye goddes of compassion had behelde him in that perplexitie, assuredly his moane would haue mooued a soddaine miracle, there was no place wherein Philamis was 
                  〈◊〉
                to disport wherein he sat not: and neuer parted he thence without sighing. But seeing no similitude of hope, or apparance of good hap to be found in that cittie, he speedily departed, seeking Italie ouer, and inquiring in euery Acadamy if happilye hee might heare of his friend, or els happily encounter him.
            In some countries happily he met with many so named, who happy in tijeyr Christendome and name, were with such ceremonie intertained by him, as if he imagned by those friendly offices to inuite this absent Philamis to fauour him. But when in no Countrey, nor in no place, he could attayne anye certayne notice of his Philamis residence, hee returned into Austria, resoluing with himselfe to forsake the world, wholye discharge him of worldlye hopes, and arme himselfe vnto the death.
            For which cause without returning to Passan, he trauailed vp towardes the Mountaines, by the verye same waye wherein hee had vnhappylye left the wounded body of his

Him thought he saw a great Dragon houering ouer his head, which caryed a hearbe in his throate, which taught him the vertue of the same hearbe, & the place likewise where it grew, and he awaking, went and found the herbe, saued Ptolomey, and releiued his souldiers: the examples are innumerable in this cause: but vouchsafe me the hearing of a history, which though it hee short wil yeeld you some solace. There dwelled heere in these deserts, more neerly bounding yonder mountains, a yong shepheard called Calimander, who fel inamoured with a yong nimph of this countrie named Ruthenia, many countrey curtesies vsed he towards hir, showing such signes of obseruance & duty, as had coy Amarillis bin so courted, she had long since bin cōtracted with Coridon, but she vain maid, being more faire then fortunat: & more precise then pritty, conceiuing pleasure in Calimanders sufferance, like ye peacock, gasing, onely on her faire plumes, not her foule feete: supposing what shee was, not what she might be: at

such time as with great deuotion the Sheapheard sought her fauour, she to trye his constancie, or els to deferre him from further fancie, enioyned him this impossible matter, to endure a seauen yeares penance in the woods of Saracon, without tasting anye sustenance but rootes, to swim ouer Laite seauen dayes euery one of these winters in these seauen yeares: and lastly to change all hir younge Lambes to lustie Heighfors. Calimander (coniecturing hir cruelty by these impossibilities) desisted not to accomplish hir desires, enduring all this seauen yeares penance with such peremptorie resolution, that all the whole countrey Swaines pittyed him, and exclaimed on Ruthenias crueltie, but as time maketh the stiffe Oke wante pith: the proude steede a poore Iade, the lustie yoong man a thr

               e footed ould man, so after long indeuour, and more daunger, Calimander was fortunate in persecuting the two least of hir commaunds, but dispaired on the last: where vpon comming with sorrie sheapheards about the mountaines, and hearing of one Climachus a cunning man, who hath forsaken the worlde to follow his studdies, hee imparted his cause of trouble to this scholer, and reported the whole circumstance of Ruthenias tyranny: who being naturally borne to vertue, and in that he was vertuous; was inclined to pitty: sought ouer his bookes to worke the shepheards benefite, and as science would and his skill sorted out, on the next day when Ruthenia should driue foorth hir lambes, she found Heyfers. Calimander assured by Climachus, and confirmed by the assurance of his friends, gaue thankes to the scholler, approoued his vowes to be accomplished, and Ruthenia had hir will, and these warres ended in a wedding, and as the poet sayth so say I sir:
            And such successe wil folow happie hope.

with Medusa, began to admire, and casting him at the seete of Climachus his approoued Philamis, he imbraced his knees, weeping such store of teares, as was pittifull to behold: Now came into his minde the vnkind crueltie towards his friend, and the thought therof was so forcible, that neuer looked Hecuba more ruthfull in the losse of her Polidoce, than Philamour did in thinking on his Philamis. The wise Rauennois knowing both the cause of his griefe, and his hearty repentaunce, as hauing fore seene them long before in his pryuate intellectuall science, comforted him in this sort.
            Arise Philamour, there was neuer so great an offence among friends but will haue a pardon: thy Philamis lyueth, and hath forgiuen thee: vertue in him hath ouercome all thy disgraces, neyther canst thou bee so vnkinde as hee is wylling to pardon. The infirmities of youth (yoong G

            All this while Philamour lay looking of the window, weeping for ioy, and oftentimes imbraced he the barre of the window, as if it had beene the dead body of his Harpaste: till sodainly Philamis smiling made him surfet at another wonder: for enioyning him by no meanes to mooue at whatsoeuer hee sawe, he caused him to sit downe by him, when sodainly there entered two in rich attire, resembling Harpaste and Philamis, the one proffering him kindnesse, the other courting him with amiable lookes: good Lord howe faine would Philamour haue moued? But feare with-held him, and care of his friends content, yet kneeled hee to Philamis, crying o

dainly they vanished, when as hee sawe in a mirrour which stood opposite against him the whole course of his trauels, his daungers, Clorius comfort, and Celios friendly trauel with him: whereon while hee meditated, him thought the Tables were spread with great delicates, the musicke and melodie reuiued his spirites, the Eunuches serued him in bowles of Saphir, and his entertainment was so sumptuous, that although hee had a good stomacke to his meate, yet fedde

               Philamour inuited thus kindly, fell to his victuals wel fauoredly, and both of them tooke the repast more pleasantly, in that the one beheld, and the other hoped to see his friend. At last the tables were taken vp, the attendants vanished, and the night beeing farre spent, Climachus conueyed his Philamour into a sumptuous chamber, where he was entertained with such delicates, musicke, and delightes, as the lyke was neuerimagined by Cleopatra for her Anthony. In briefe, after long discourse, and Philamours many vowes, his secret sighes, his repentant hearts griefe, his humble suite to see Philamis, his prayers to enioy Harpaste, the graue scholler left him fully resolued, promising him the next day so to further his desires, that he should not onely enioy her whom hee sought, but see him whome hee wished for: and thus with a friendly Adios he left him to his rest.

At last when Philamis had ordered all things by his Art, and prouided horses for their iourney, he sodainly entered the chamber of Philamour: who beholding the olde countenance, and auncient courtly habite of his friend was rauished with ioy, and falling downe before the feete of Philamis, he thus expostulated.

               Philamis not able to indure further delayes, casting his armes about the necke of his Philamour, began thus.

Behold my vowes performed, and your requests accomplished: See Laite with raging waters raunging through the vallyes, seeming rather a huge Sea, than a little Riuer: beholde my Philamis aliue, whom you supposed dead, whom Ipresent as apresent to intreate you to take pittie.

Harpaste mooued with these reasons: like the Marbell tamed with manye stroakes: the gould tryed with whote fire, the steele formed by many heats, at last relented: and behoulding Philamour with a kinde looke, and taking Philamis by the hande, returned them both this short and sweet aunswer.
            Things attained with long labour (Gentlemen) at the last breede most delight, and when the tryall is past, the truthe is more accepted: since therefore Philamour hath endured, I will rewarde his dutie: and for your sake Philamis vouchsafe him such kindnesse, as my honour regarded, and my fathers consent procured, I rest his in all loue, and yours to commaund, who haue trauailed for him as his friend, and I shall ere long see him the Lorde of my fauours. Philamis was not a little iocund to see this end: nor Philamour solemne to heare this sentence: to be short, after the feast was finished, and the guests readye to rise, by the consent of both parties, Philamis brake the matter to Nicrosion: who knowing Philamours birth, bringing vp, and great riches, heartily condiscended: Wherevpon in the assemblye of the Nobles they were both bethrothed, and happily in short space marryed: at which solemnitie Caelio was a bidden guest, and Clorius was highly entertained, and for his many curt

               Thou tellest me no newes Philamis, neyther may we mend it till God end it, I aske no tydings of it but of thee: howe thou spendest the daye heere in these mountaynes? what are thy studdies? what thy methode?

               Celio
               Thy studdie is then superficiall, In alieno aedificat Mathematica, it borroweth his principles from an other; by meanes where of it attaineth to matters of higher perfection, if by it selfe it comprehended truth, &

                   to attaine the same, if by it selfe it could decide and manifest the nature of the whole world, it would profit our mindes, & help our memories: but in that it doth not so, doate not on it so.
            
            
               Phi.
               I wonder Celio you dispraise that so generaly, which is so perfect in his parts. I haue red Aristotle, who in his Elenchs saith, that they who are vnredy in number, are vncapable of the secrets of nature: beside Augustine a catholique doctor concludeth this. Nemo (saith he) ad diuinarum 
                        〈◊〉
                      rerum cognitionem accedat, insiprius artem numerandi discat. If therefore Arithmatique being but the entrance to the Mathematiques be so beneficiall, what shall we thinke of the rest, but as of things exceeding singular.
            
            
               Ce.
               I condemne them not as unnecessary, but would teach and traine thee in studies more necessary: numeration teacheth thee howe to count thy sheepe, but not how to amend thy sinnes. Arithmatique schooleth thee to apply thy fingers to auarice, but I would haue thee instructed how to draw thy mind from couetousnes: the candle is a faire light till thou behouldest the sun, and these

                   blocks of wit are sweets, till thou perfectly see wisdom.

               Ce.
               Geometry lerneth thee how to mesure thy fields, but not maister thy fancies: what profiteth thee to know an 
                     〈◊〉
                   of land, & not the anchor of life?

                  s: but how much better were it for thee to learne howe thou mightest willing loose them? It instructeth thee to knowe the round from the square, the distances of the Planets: but broughtest thou thy minde in proportion were it not better? Alexander of Macedon began to learne this Science to his sorow: for finding by dimension how little the world was, and how small a part he possessed, he found himselfe great in too little. I tell thee Philamis, had Philips sonne sought out true science, as he studdied this silly secret, he had seemed greater to himselfe in contemning the world, then in conquering it.

               What thinke you of Musick.
            
            
               Celio.
               It is the darling of lost time: it teacheth thee to know sharpe and flat, high and lowe, Diapente and Diapason: but could it teach thee consonance of the minde, and constancie in counsailes, this were better Musick, this instructeth thee in vnitie, but maketh thee not as one. I haue reade that Zenophantus Harpe could mooue affections, but neuer maister them: these are trifles that aske much toyle and yeelde little treasure.

               The kaye of presumption is Astrologie, where men ascribe to the oposition of Planets the cause of alterations, which are onely to be applyed to Gods prouidence, who is he that dare claime the knowledge of things to come, vnlesse he haue the seale of a Prophet? these are vaine things young Philamis, and lets in our way, which hinder vs from the attainment of true blessednesse. Beware therfore, and bind not thy selfe to the things thou knowest not: but learne thou to seeke out such things as thou shouldst know.
            
            
               Phi.
               And what are they?

               Here stay good Celio, thou hast long time discoursed heere of the benefits of life euerlasting, but giuest no assurance of the same. Saith not the Philosopher, Post mortem nulla voluptas? how can then this life be eternal wherin there is no pleasure. If it be true that Apollonius Tianeus aledgeth, and the Pythagorists perswade, that the soules haue passage from one body to another, me thinks this separation should be rather cause of molest, than myrth to the spirit. Homer besides a great Poet sayth, that death is ful of horrour: satissie me heerein (good Celio) that euery way thou mayest say sufficient.

If there be no pleasure after the soule is departed, what becommeth of the righteous? deemest thou who hath runne hys race, hath not his garland? and that hee who hath finished hys course, hath not his quiet? For Apollonius Tianeus since the Fathers condemn him, commend him not: for as one swallow maketh not a sommer, so a fewe instances subuert not an vniuersal certaintie. Eusebius (with other learned) examining the cause of feare, especially in death, reasoneth thus: If there be any euill in death, it is the feare of the same that increaseth it, and if there be no euill, the feare it selfe is a great euil: fond then is he that feareth death, for that he augmenteth his euill, or rather causeth it himselfe. Base is the spirit of euery man, saith Sabellicus, which feareth deth: for fearing it in his own respect, in that he is in soule immortall, he ought not to fear, if he lose his body: for what folly is it to be afraid of that which is at enmitie with vs? If desire of gaine hath made death but a trifle, among the men of no heauenly capacitie: If it hath incouraged some to stop a swallowing gulfe with ye Romane, to die for their maister, as the slaue of Anthony, what should death be to vs, which expect not a momentary, but an immortal glory? nor raised among men, but registred in immortality? The sweetnes of death was manifest in the persecutions of the Primitiue Church, where infantes with great constancie endured much crueltie: sweete is the payne in expectation of the

               SInce there is no remedy (as Euripides sayth) more appropriate to men in perplexitie, then the exhortation of good & faithfull friends, I haue taken vpon me the libertie if not to please, yet to perswade thee Anthenor, who hauing knowne worloly affaires, maist more easily disgest afflictions. Thou art greeued in that thou art banished thy country, dispised of thy prince, exiled from the court, beguiled of thy contents, as if to a wiseman all countries are not one? and Anacharsis should not as well florish in Athens, as he was fauour

The Pilate knoweth the goodnes of his ship in a wrought sea, not in a weake wind: and such as will not beare fortunes touch, are vnworthy Uertues temper: coulors that are not in grain, are soonest disgraced, aud such as haue not tasted changes, cannot boast of constancy: euery country (saith Democritus) is free and open to a wise man: and the world is but euery valiant mans walke: what is exile but that which may be euery mans fortune? if banishment were so bitter, why did Scipio make it voluntary? say thou wantest in exile, so did Scipio maintenants, Regulus mercinaries, and Menenio funerall, I tel thee Anthenor calamity is the occasion of vertue, and no griefe is long that is great, Anathagoras neither greeued to dye a forrainer, neither fainted to perish in pouerty since he knew the earth ritch enough to giue him graue, the world small enough to be his country.

                  Anthenor thou hast gotten much by this griefe, thou hast escaped vanitie, and vertue clothed in pouertie, beginneth now to haile thee, now maist thou tread fortune vnder foote, in that she hath doone hir worst, and triumph like a conqueror, since thou contemnest hir wilinesse: euen as the losse of leaues is small in that the next spring renueth them, so the want of delights are of no waight, since a reconciled mind doth soone restore them. Beware least Democritus laugh at thee, and Heraclitus weep for thee: the one to see the passionate, who hast tryed the worlds inconstancie: the other to thinke thy brayne should be so addle, and thou so aged. But why trauaile I to teach that which the meanest minde doth imagine: truly Anthenor since each storme will haue a calme, since in Tigris the Minow hath as great libertie as ye Mullet, since the Loate thriueth as well in Tibris as Tanais, and the poorest constant minde in the straungest country: dry thou vp thy teares, and shake of these trifles, let the equitie of thy cause confirme thy quiet, thy fruitfull constancie exceede fortunes contempt, so shalt thou prooue thy selfe well staied and better studied. Vale.
