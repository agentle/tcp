Taken out of the fourth booke of Kinges the .v. Chapter.
            
            To the tune of Kynge Salomon.
            
               
                  WAs not the Bryber Gehezie
               Rewarded iuſtly of the Lord,
               Which for example verelie,
               The holie Scripture doth recorde
               If this be true, as true it was,
               Of his rewarde:
               Why ſhould not chriſtan men alas,
               Than haue regarde.
            
            
               ¶When that the Prophet Elizae
               Had clenſed from the Leproſie,
               Naaman of Aſſiria,
               Thorow the workes of God on hye:
               Then Naaman wolde him conſtrame
               To take rewarde:
               But Elizae from that refrainde,
               And had regarde.
            
            
               ¶But Gehezie of falſehed minde,
               When Naaman did paſſe awaie.
               Did hie him faſte that was behinde,
               And vnto Naaman did ſaie:
               Beholde my maſter hath me ſente
               For a rewarde,
               To Prophetes children he is bente
               To haue regarde.
            
            
               ¶With right good will ſaid Naaman,
               Him to rewarde, and did proceede,
               And Gehezie conuaide it then
               So preuilie in verie deede,
               For getting that the Prophete tho,
               Of his, rewarde
               Could by the ſprite of God it knowe,
               And haue regarde,
            
            
               ¶Alas how was thou Gehezie,
               Rauiſhed in worldy gaint?
               How was thou brought to mizerie,
               Of God appointed for thy paine,
               And all thy of ſpringe after thee,
               For thy rewarde,
               The Lorde that hateth Briberie,
               Hath his regarde.
            
            
               ¶Then Gehezie deceitfulie
               To fore the Prophet tooke his waie,
               Who ſaid to hime, o Gehezie,
               Went not my harte with thee I ſaie,
               When Naaman from Charret came,
               Thee to rewarde:
               And thou haſt falſelie hid the ſame,
               without regarde.
            
            
               ¶(Gehezie) is it now a time
               Thy bribes (he ſaid) for to receaue?
               Beholde for this thy wicked crime
               That leproſeie to thee ſhall cleaue,
               The which was vpon Naaman,
               For thy rewarde,
               And to thy ſeede thee after than,
               To haue regarde.
            
            
               Incontinent then Gehezie
               Departed from his preſence ſo,
               As the Texte doth verefie,
               A Leper white as is the ſnowe,
               Example to ſuch bribers all,
               To haue regarde,
               With Geheziè at lengthe they ſhall
               Haue their rewarde,
            
            
               ¶If they doe not their faultes confeſſe
               Deteſtinge of their Bryberie,
               Elſe God will ſpie ther wickedneſſe
               Though they it cloke with Genezie:
               And can them paie accordinglie,
               The like rewarde,
               As he hath done to Iehezie,
               O haue regarde.
            
            
               ¶The Lord he is that ſame God ſtill
               That he was than vndoubtedlie,
               Such Gehezies he puniſh will,
               That Bribes receiue ſo wickedlie,
               Though they ſo preuilie do hide
               their falſe rewarde.
               Yet of the Lorde it will be ſpide,
               Who hath regarde.
            
            
               ¶O Lorde vs guide in all our waies
               That we may leade our liues a right
               to deale with trueth at all aſſaies,
               Giue vnto vs thy holie ſprite:
               And that our Queene & her Councell
               Maie haue regarde,
               In this Lande Bribers to expell
               that take rewarde.
            
            ¶Finis.
