a fauourer of Gods true worde, and of

by some vertuous meanes, to
winne your loue and fauour, and with
some goodly & delitius presēt, to winde

Ioan. i. Cap. i.
               IN the beginning
was the worde,Iohn. and
the worde was with
God, and God was
the word. The same
was in the begynnynge
wyth God.
All thynges were made by the same,
and without the same was made nothynge.
That was made in hym was
lyfe, and the lyfe was the light of men:
and the lyghte shyneth in the darckenesse,
and the darckenesse comprehended
it not.
               Of the Annūciation & conception
of Iohn ye Baptist. Luc. i. Ca. ii.
               
                  
IN the tyme of Herode kynge of
Iewrye,Luke. there was a Priest named
Zachari of the familye and
 house of Abia: and hys wyfe of
the doughters of Aaron, and her name
Elizabeth. They were bothe ryghteous
before God, and walked in all the
commaundementes and statutes of
the Lorde vnreproueablye. And they
had no chylde, for Elizabeth was barren,
and they were both well strycken
in age. And it came to passe, as he executed
the Priestes office before God,
when hys course came (accordynge to
the costume of the Priesthode) it fell to
hys lot, to burne incense. And he went
into the temple of the Lorde, and the
whole multitude of the people was
wythout in prayer, whyle the incense
was a burnynge. And the aungel of the
Lorde appeared vnto hym, and stode
on the ryghte syde of the aultre of incense.
And when Zachari sawe hym, he
was abasshed, and there came a feare
vpon hym. But the Aungell sayd vnto
him: feare not Zachari, for thy praier is
heard. And thy wyfe Elizabeth shall
beare thee a sonne, whose name thou
shalt call Iohn, and thou shalte haue

ioye and gladnesse, and manye shal reioyce
at hys byrth, for he shall be great
before the Lorde. Wyne and stronge
dryncke shall he not dryncke. And he
shalbe fylled wyth the holy ghost, euen
in hys mothers wombe. And manye of
the chyldren of Israell shall he tourne
vnto the Lorde their God. And he shal
go before hym in the spirite & power of
Elias, to tourne ye heartes of ye fathers
vnto the chyldrē, & the vnfaythful vnto
the wysdome of the righteous to make
the people redye vnto ye Lord. And Zachari
sayde vnto the Aungell, wherby
shall I knowe thys? For I am olde,
and my wife wel strycken in age. The
Aungell aunswered, and sayde vnto
hym: I am Gabriel that stande before
God, and am sent to speake vnto thee,
and to shewe thee these glad tidynges.
And beholde, thou shalt be domme, and
not able to speake, vntyll the day that
thys come to passe, because thou haste
not beleued my wordes, whiche shall
be fulfylled in their season. And the
people wayted for Zachari, and meruayled
that he taryed so longe in the
temple. And whē he went out he could
not speake vnto theym. And they perceyued

that he had sene a vision in the
temple. And he beckened vnto theym
and remayned speachelesse. And it fortuned
when the tyme of hys offyce was
out, he went home into hys house. And
after those dayes, Elizabeth his wyfe
conceaued, and hyd her selfe fyue monethes,
and sayd: thus hath the Lorde
done vnto me in the dayes, wherein he
hath loked vpō me, to take awaye frō
me my rebuke amonge men.

vnto a Uirgyn that was
spoused vnto a mā whose name was
Ioseph, of the house of Dauid, and the
Uirgyns name was Mary. And the
Aungell came in vnto her, and sayd:
Hayle thou full of grace, the Lorde is
with thee: Blessed art thou amonge
women. Whan she had heard these
thynges, she was abasshed at hys sayinge,
and thought: what maner of salutacion
is thys? And the Aungel sayde

vnto her: Feare not Mary, for thou
hast founde grace with God. Beholde,
thou shalt conceaue in thy wombe, and
beare a sonne, and shalt call his name
Iesus, he shalbe great, and shalbe called
the sonne of the hyest. And the Lord
God shall geue hym the seate of Dauid
his father, and he shalbe Kynge ouer
the house of Iacob for euer, and
there shalbe no ende of hys kyngdome.
Then sayd Mary vnto the Aungell,
how shall thys be, seynge I know not
a man? The Aungel aunswered, and
sayde vnto her: The holy ghost shall
come vpon thee, and the power of the
hyest shal ouershadowe thee. Therfore
that holy also, whiche shalbe borne (of
thee), shal be called the sonne of God.
And beholde, thy cosyn Elizabeth, she
also hath conceaued a sonne in her old
age, and thys is the syxte mooneth of
her, whiche is reported to be baren, for
with God is nothyng impossible. And
Mary sayde: beholde, here am I the
handemayden of the Lorde, be it vnto
me as thou hast sayde. (Iohn) And the
worde became fleashe, and dwelte amonge

And it fortuned as Elizabeth
hearde the salutacion of Mary, the
Babe sprange in her wombe. And Elizabeth
was fylled with ye holy ghoste,
and cryed loude, and sayd: Blessed arte
thou amonge women, and blessed is
the fruite of thy wombe. And howe
happeneth thys to me y• the mother of

when I heard the voyce of thy salutacion,

with ioye. And blessed arte thou that
hast beleued: For the thynges shall be
performed, which were tolde the from

But he that doth the wil of my father

haue we not prophecied in thy name?
Haue we not cast oute deuels in thy

vpon a rocke (Math.) And whan abundance
of rayne descended and the

But whyle men slepte, there came an

forth fruite, then the tares appeared
also. Then came the seruauntes to the
householder, and sayde vnto hym: Sir
sowdeste thou not good seede in thy

He sayde vnto them, that hath the
enemy done. Then sayd the seruaūtes,
wylt thou then that we go and wede
them out? He said, No, leste whyle ye
wede out the tares, ye plucke vp the
wheat also with them. Let them bothe
grow together, tyl the haruest, and in
tyme of haruest, I wyll say vnto the
reapers. Gather the tares fyrste, and
bynde them in sheaues to be brente,
but the wheate into my barne. (mar.)
And he sayde vnto them. The kyngedome
of God is after this maner, as
when a man casteth sede vpon ye lande,
and slepeth, and it ryseth nyght & day,
and the seede spryngeth vp, and groweth

he not knowynge of it. For the
earthe bryngeth forthe the fruite of itselfe,
fyrste the grasse, afterwarde the
eare, then the full Wheate in the eare.
But when she hathe broughte forthe
the fruite, he putteth to the Sickle, because
the Haruest is come. (mat) Another
Parable he put forth vnto theim,

tooke, and sowed it in hys felde, (Mar)
whyche whan it was sowen vppon

And when he hadde tourned ouer the

written:* The spirite of the Lorde is

me, to preache the Gospell vnto the

closed the booke, he gaue it agayne to

the eyes of al that were in ye sinagoge

were fastened on him. And he began to
say vnto thē: This dai is this scripture

Then Iesus lyfte vp his eyes, & sawe

But this he said to proue hym, for he

dyd eat * Manna in the wyldernes, as

it is written: he gaue them bread from

true breade from heauen, for thys is
that breade of God whiche commeth
from heauen, and geueth lyfe vnto the

Syr geue vs alway suche breade. But
Iesus sayde vnto them, I am y• breade
of lyfe, he that commeth vnto me shall
not hunger, and he that beleueth on
me, shal neuer thyrste. But I haue said
vnto you, that ye haue sene me, and yet
ye beleue not. Al that my father geueth
me, commeth vnto me, and who so cō
                     meth
vnto me, him wyl not I cast out:
For I am come downe from heauen,
not to do myne owne wyll, but the wil

wyl of the father whiche hath sent me,
that of all that he hathe geuen me, I
shoulde lose nothynge, but shoulde aryse
it vp agayne at the laste daye.
                  This is the wyll of hym whyche hathe
sent me, that who soeuer seeth ye sonne,
and beleueth on hym, shoulde haue euerlastynge

the Iewes thereon that he sayde: I

from heauen. And they sayde: Is not
thys Iesus Iosephs sonne? Whose
father and mother we knowe? Howe
sayeth he then, I am come downe frō

vnto theym: (Mark) Murmure not amonge

vnto me, except my father which hath
sent me drawe hym. And I shall raise,
hym vp at the laste daye. It is wrytten
in the Prophetes.Esay. 54 c

heareth it of the father, and learneth

manne hathe sene the father, saue he
whyche is of the father, the same hathe
sene the father. Uerely, verely, I saye
vnto you, he that beleueth on me, hath
euerlastynge lyfe. I am that bread of
lyfe. Your fathers dyd eate Manna in
the Wyldernesse and are deade. This
is that breade whiche commeth from
heauen. That whoso eateth thereof
should not die. I am that liuing bread
which came downe frō heauen: whoso
eateth of this bread, shal lyue for euer.

And the bread that I wyll geue, is my
fleash, which I wyl geue for the lyfe of

bloude, ye haue no lyfe in you. Whoso
eateth my fleash, & drinketh my bloud,

is the verye meate, and my bloude is
the verye drincke. Whoso eateth my
fleashe, and dryncketh my bloude, abydeth
in me, and I in him. As the liuing
father hath sent me. And I lyue for the
fathers sake, euen so he that eateth me
shall lyue for my sake. Thys is youre
bread whiche is comme from heauen.
Not as your fathers did eate Manna,
and are deade, he that eateth of thys
bread shall lyue for euer. These thynges
sayde he in the synagoge, when he

them. Doeth this offende you? What &
yf ye shal see the sonne of man ascende
vp thyther where he was afore? It is
the spirite that quickeneth, the fleashe
profyteth nothynge. The wordes that

there are some amonge you, that beleue
not. For Iesus knewe well frome

From that tyme forth manye of hys

Iohn. v. Capitulo. lxvi.
                  AFterwarde was there a feaste of
the Iewes, [called vvitsontyde]
and Iesus wente vp to Ierusalem.
There is at Ierusalem by
the slaughter house a poole, whiche in
Hebrewe is called Bethsaida, and
hath fiue porches, wherein laye many
sycke, blynde, lame, wythered, whyche
wayte when the water shoulde moue.
For the aungell wente downe at hys
time into the poole and styrred ye water.
Whosoeuer nowe wente downe
first after that y• water was styred, the
same was made whole, whatsoeuer
disease he had. And there was a man,
whiche had lyen sicke. xxxviii. yeares.
When Iesus saw him lye, and knewe

that he had lyen so longe, he sayd vnto
him: Wylte thou be made whole? The
sicke aunswered him: Sir, I haue no
man when the water is moued, to put
me into ye poole. And whē I come, another
steppeth downe in before me. Iesus
sayd vnto hi: arise, take vp thy bed,
& go thy way. And immediatly, the mā
was made whole, and toke vp his bed,
and went his way. But vpon the same
day, it was the Sabboth. Then sayde
the Iewes vnto hym that was made
whole. Todaye is the Sabboth, it is
not lawful for thee to cary thy bed. He
answered thē: he that made me whole,
sayde vnto me: take vp thy bedde, & go
thy way. Then asked they him. What
man is that, which said vnto thee, take
vp thy bedde, and go thy way? But he
that was healed wist not who he was:
for Iesus had gotten hym selfe away,
because there was much people. Afterwarde
Iesus founde hym in the temple,
& sayd vnto hym: Behold, thou art
made whole, sin no more, leste a worse
thyng happen vnto thee. The man departed
& tolde the Iewes, that it was
Iesus which hadde made hym whole.
Therfore dyd ye Iewes persecute Iesus

and sought to slay him, because he
had done this vpon the Sabboth. But
Iesus answered thē: My father worketh
hetherto, & I worke also, therfore
sought the Iewes more to slaye him,
because he brake not onely y• Sabboth,
but sayd also ye God was his father: &
made him selfe equall with God. Thē
answered Iesus, & sayd vnto thē: verely,
verely I say vnto you. The son can
do nothing of hym selfe, but that he seeth
the father doe. For what soeuer he
doeth, y• doeth y• sonne also. The father
loueth the son, & sheweth hym all that
he doeth, and wil shew him yet greater
workes, so y• ye shal meruayle. For the
father rayseth vp y• dead, and maketh
them lyue, euen so ye sonne also maketh
lyuing whom he wil. For y• father iudgeth
no man but hath geuen al iudgement
vnto ye sonne, that they all might
honour the sonne, euen as they honour
the father. Who so honoureth not the
sonue, the same honoureth not the father
which hath sent hym. Uerely, verely,
I say vnto you the houre cometh
and is now already, that y• dead shall
heare the voyce of the sonne of God:
And they that heare it shall lyue. For

as the father hath lyfe in him selfe, so
lyke wise hath he geuen vnto y• sonne to
haue lyfe in him selfe: And hath geuen
him power also to execute iudgement,
because he is the sonne of man. Maruayle
ye not at thys, for the hour commeth,
in the whiche that al y• are in the
graues shal heare hys voyce: and shall
goe forthe that haue done good vnto
the Resurrection of lyfe. But they
that haue done euyll, vnto the Resurrection
of damnaption. I canne do
nothynge of my selfe. As I heare, so
I iudge, and my iudgement is iuste.
For I seeke not myne owne wyll,
but the wyll of my father whyche
hathe sente me. Yf I heare wytnesse
of my selfe, my wytnesse is not true,
there is another that beareth wytnesse
of me, and I am sure that the
wytnesse whyche he beareth of me is
true. Ye sente vnto Iohn, and he
beare wytnesse of the trueth. As for
me I take no recorde of man: but these
thinges I say, that ye myght be saued.
He was a burnyng and shinyng light,
but ye woulde haue reioysed a whyle
in his lyghte. Neuerthelesse, I haue a
greater wytnesse then the wytnesse

of Iohn, for the workes which ye father
hath geuen me, to finish, the same workes
which I do, beare witnes of me, yt
the father hath sent me. And the father
him selfe whiche hath sent me, beareth
witnes of me: Ye haue nother hearde
his voyce at anyetyme, nor sene hys
shape, nor his worde haue ye not abydynge
in you, for ye beleue not hym,
whom he hath sent. Searche the scriptures,
for ye thyncke, ye haue euerlastyng
lyfe therin, & the same is it, that
testifieth of me, and ye wyll not come
vnto me, that ye myght haue lyfe. I receaue
no prayse of men. But I knowe
you that ye haue not ye loue of God in
you. I am come in my fathers name,
and ye receaue me not, yf another shal
come in his downe name, hym wyl ye
receaue. Howe can ye beleue, whyche
receaue prayse one of another, & seke
not the prayse that is of God onelye?
Ye shall not thyncke that I wyll accuse
you before the father. There is
one that accuseth you euen Moses, in
whom ye trust, if ye beleued Moses, y
                        •
                     
shold beleue me also. For he hath writtē

her: woman, be delyuered from thy disease.
And he layde hys handes vpon
her, and immediatlye she was made
strayghte, and praysed God. Then answered
the ruler of the Sinagoge, and
tooke indignacion because Iesus healed
vpon the Sabboth, and sayde vnto
the people. There are syre dayes,
wherein meu ought to worke, in them
come and be healed, and not on the
Sabboth. Then the Lorde aunswered

went about Galile, for he wolde
 not walke in Iewry, because the
Iewes foughte to kyll hym. But the
Iewes feast of Tabernacles was at
hande. Then sayde hys brethren vnto
him: Get thee hence, and goe into Iewry,
that thy disciples also may see thy
workes, that thou doest. He that seketh
to be openlye knowen, doeth nothynge
in secrete, yf thou doe suche thinges,
then shewe thy selfe before the worlde.
For hys brethren also beleued not in
hym. Then sayde Iesus: my time is
not yet come, but your tyme is alway
readye. The worlde cannot hate you,
but me it hat

ye vp vnto the feast. I wyll not goe vp
yet vnto thys feaste, for my tyme is
not fulfyled. When he hadde sayde

vnto theym, he abode styll in Galile.
(Mathe) While they wer occupied and
conuersaunt in Galile (Mar) he taught
hys disciples, and sayde vnto theym:
The sonne of manne shall be delyuered
into the handes of menne, and thei
shall putte hym to death, and when he
is putte to deathe, he shall ryse agayne
the thyrde daye. But they vnderstode
not that worde, and it was hydden
from theym, that they perceyued it
not, and were afrayed to aske hym,
(Mathe) and they were verye sorye.
(Iohn.) But assoone as hys brethren
were gone vp, then went he vp also vn
to the feast, not openlye, but as it were
secretely. Then the Iewes sought him
at the feast, and sayde: Where is he?
And there was a great rumour of him
amonge the people. Some sayde: He
is God. But other sayde: No, he doeth
but deceaue the people. Howe be it, no
manne spake frelye of hym for feare
of the Iewes. But in the myddes of
the feaste wente Iesus vp into the
Temple, and taughte. And the Iewes
maruayled, and sayde: Howe
canne he the Scriptures, seynge he
hathe not learned it?

doctrine is not myne, but his that hath
sent me. Yf any man wyl do hys wyll,
he shall knowe whether thys doctrine
be of God, or whether I speake of my
selfe, he that speaketh of hym selfe, seketh
hys owne prayse, but he that seketh
the prayse of hym that sent hym,
the same is true and there is no vnryghteousnesse
in hym.

Deuyl, who goeth aboute to kyll thee?

because it commeth of Moses, but of
the fathers, yet do ye circumcise a mā

circumcision vpon the Sabboth, that

disdayne ye then at me, because
I haue made a man euery whit whole

in dede that he is very Christ? How be
it, we knowe whence thys is: But
when Christ commeth, no man shall
know whence he is. Then cried Iesus
in the temple as he taughte, and sayde:
yea, ye know me, and whence I am ye
know. And of my selfe am I not come,
but he that sent me is true, whome ye
knowe not: But I knowe him, for I
am of him, and he hath sent me. Then

layed handes vpon hym, for his houre
was not yet come. But manye of the
people beleued on hym, and sayde:
when Christ commeth shal be do moe
tokens then this doeth? And it came to
the Pharises eares that the people
murmured suche thynges of hym.
And the Pharises and hye Priestes
sent out seruauntes to take hym. Thē
sayde Iesus vnto them: I am yet a lytle
whyle wyth you, and then go I vnto
hym that hath sent me, and ye shall
seke me, and not fynde me, and where
I am, thyther canne ye not comme.
Then sayde the Iewes amonge them

selues. Whither wyll he goe, that we
shal not fynde hym
                        •
                      Wyl he go among
the Gentiles that are scattred abrode,
and teache the Gentyles? What maner
of sayinge is thys that he sayeth:
ye shall seeke me and not fynde me,
and where I am thyther canne ye not
come? But in the laste daye whyche
was the mooste solempne daye of the
feaste, Iesus stode vp, cryed, and sayd:
Who so thyrsteth lette hym come to
me and dryncke. He that beleueth on
me, as the scripture sayeth, oute of hys
bodye shall flowe ryuers of the water
of lyfe. But thus spake he of the spirite,
whyche they that beleue on hym,
shoulde receaue: For the holye ghoste
was not yet there, because Iesus was
not glorifyed. Manye of the people
nowe when they hearde thys sayinge,
sayde: Thys is a verye Prophete. Other
sayde, he is Christe. But some
sayde: shall Christe come out of Galile?
Say

Christ shal come of the sede of Dauid,
and out of the towne of Bethleem
where Dauid was. Thys was the
diffention amonge the people for hys
sake. Some of theym woulde haue taken

hym, but no manne layed handes
on hym. The seruauntes came to the
hye Priestes and Pharises, and they
sayde vnto theym. Why haue ye not
brought hym? The seruauntes aunswered.
Neuer mā spake as this man

Pharises: are ye also deceaued? Doeth
any of the rulers or Pharises beleue

knowe not the lawe, are cursed.
Nicodemus sayde vnto theym, he that
came vnto him by nyght, whiche was
one of them: Doth our law iudge any
man before it heare hym, and knowe

I knowe whence I came, and whether
I go, but ye cannot tel whēce I come,
nor whither I go: ye iudge after the

him, we are Abrahams feede, we were
neuer bonde to any manne: how sayest
thou then, ye shalbe free? Iesus answered
them and sayde: Uerely, verely I
say vnto you, who so euer doth sinne, is
ye seruaunt of sinne: As for the seruaunt
he abydeth not in the house for euer,
but the sonne abydeth euer. Yf the
tonne therefore shall make you free,
then are ye free in dede. I knowe
that ye are Abrahams seede, but ye
seke meanes to kyll me, for my worde
taketh not am

ye do that ye haue sene of your father.
They aunswered and sayd vnto hym:
Abraham is our father. Iesus sayde

ye woulde do the dedes of Abraham:
But nowe ye go about to kyl me,
a man that haue colde you the trueth,
whyche I haue hearde of God, thys
dyd not Abraham, ye do the dedes of
youre father. Then sayde they vnto
hym, we are not borne of fornication,
we haue one father euen God. Iesus
sayde vnto them, yf God were your father,
then would ye loue me, for I am
proceaded foorthe, and come frō God,
for I am not come of my selfe, but he
hath sent me. Why knowe ye not then
my speache? euen because ye cannot abyde
the hearynge of my worde, ye are
of the father the deuyl, and after the lustes
of youre father wyll ye do. The
same was a murtherer from the begynninge,
and abode not in the trueth,
for the trueth is not in hym, whan he
speaketh a lye, then speaketh he of hys
owne: for he is a lyar, and a father of
the same, but because I say the trueth,
ye beleue me not. He that is of God,
heareth the worde of God, ye therefore

do not heare it, because ye are not of
God. Whiche of you can rebuke me of
any synne? yf I saye the trueth, why do
ye not beleue me? Then answered the

not right that thou art a Samaritane,
and haste the deuyl? Iesus aunswered,
I haue no deuyll, but I honoure my
father, and ye haue dyshonoured me.
I seke not mine owne praise, but there
is one that seketh it, and iudgeth. Uerely,
verely I say vnto you, yf any man
kepe my worde, he shall neuer sedeath.
Then sayde the Iewes vnto him, now
knowe we that thou haste the deuell,
Abraham is dead and the Prophetes,
and thou sayest, yf any man kepe my
worde, he shal neuer taste of death. Art
thou greater then our father Abraham
whyche is deade

selfe? Iesus answered, yf I prayse my
selfe, then is my prayse nothynge. But
it is my father that prayseth me, which
ye say is your God, and ye know hym
not, but I know hym. And yf I should
say I knowe him not, I should be a lyar,
lyke vnto you: But I know hym,
and kepe his word. Abraham youre father

was glad, that he shoulde see my
daye, and he saw it, and reioyced. Thē
said y• Iewes vnto hym. Thou art not
yet fyftie yeare olde, and hast thou sene
Abraham? Iesus said vnto them: verely,

was I am. Then toke they vp
stones to cast at him, but Iesus hid him

Ioan. ix. Capi. lxxvii.
                  ANd Iesus passed by,Ioan and sawe a
man that was borne blynde, and
his disciples asked him, and sayd:
 Master, who hath sinned? this, or
his elders, that he was borne blynde
                        •
                     
Iesus answered, nother hath this synned,
nor his elders, but y• the workes of
God shuld be shewed on him. I muste
worke the workes of him y• hath sente
me, while it is day, ye night cōmeth whā
no man can worke. As lōge as I am in
ye world. I am ye light of y• world, whan
he had thus said, he spat on ye grounde
and made clay of ye spatle, & rubbed the
claye on the eyes of the blynde, & sayde
vnto him: go thy waye to ye pole of Siloe

which is interpreted, sent, & wathe
thee. Then wenth
                        •
                      his way, & washed
him, & came seynge. The neighbours,
and they y• had sene him before, howe y•
he was a begger, sayde: Is not this he
that sat & begged? Some said it is he,
other sayde, he is lyke him, but he hym
selfe said. I am euē he. Then said they
vnto him. How are thine eyes opened?
he said, the man y• is called Iesus made
clay, & annoynted myne eyes, & sayde,
go thy way to y• pole of Siloe, & washe
thee, I wēt my way & washed me, & receaued
my sight. Thē said they vnto hī:
where is he? he said: I cannot tel. Thē
brought they him to ye Pharises y• was
blinde. It was ye Sabboth whā Iesus
made y• clay, & opened his eyes. Thē againe
ye Pharises asked hym, howe he
had receaued his sight. He sayde vnto
thē, he put clay vpō mine eyes, & I washed
me, & now I see. Thē said some of
ye Pharises. This man is not of God,
seynge he kepeth not ye Sabboth. But y•
other saied how cā a synful mā do such
tokens? and there was a strife amonge
them. They said agayne to the blynde,
what saiest thou of him, y• hath opened
thyne eyes? he said he is a Prophete.

The Iewes beleued not hym, that he
was blinde, and had receaued his sight
tyll they called the elders of hym that
had receaued hys syghte. And they asked
thē, and sayd: Is this your sonne,
whome ye say was borne blynde? how
doth he now se thē? hys father and mother
answered thē, & sayd. We knowe y•
this is oure sonne, & that he was borne
blynde: but how he nowe seeth, we can
not tell, or who hath opened his eyes,
can we not tel, he is olde ynough, aske
him, let hym speake for him selfe. This
sayde hys elders, because they feared
the Iewes: for the Iewes had conspired
already, that yf any manne dyd cōfesse
that he was Christ, the same should be
excommunicate, therefore sayd hys elders,
he is olde ynoughe, aske hym.
                  Then called they the manne agayne
that was blynde, and sayde vnto hym:
geue God the prayse, we knowe that
this manne is a synner. He aunswered
and sayd: whether he be a sinner or no,
I can not tell, one thyng am I sure of,
that I was blynde, and now I se. Then
sayde they vnto hym agayne, what did
he vnto thee? Howe opened he thyne
eyes? he aunswered them: I tolde you

ryght now, hearde ye it not: what, wyl
ye heare it agayne? wyll ye also be his
dyscyples? Then rated they hym, and
sayd: be thou his disciple, we are Moses
disciples, we are sure y• God spake
with Moses: As for this felowe we
know not whence he is. The man answered,
and sayd vnto them: This is a
merueylous thynge, that ye wotte not
whence he is, and he hath opened mine
eyes. For we knowe that God heareth
no sinners, but yf a man be a worshipper
of God, and doeth hys wyll, hym
heareth he. Sence the worlde beganne
was it not heard, that any manne opened
the eyes of one y• was borne blind.
Yf thys mā were not of God, he could
haue done nothynge. They answered,
and sayd vnto him. Thou arte al together
borne in synne, & teachest thou vs?
And they thrust him out. Iesus heard
that they had thrust him out, and whē
he had founde hym, he sayde vnto him:
Beleuest thou on the sonne of God?
He answered and sayd: Lorde, who is
he, that I might beleue on him? Iesus
sayd vnto him: Thou haste sene him, &
he it is that talketh with thee, he sayd:
Lord I beleue, & he worshypped hym.

And Iesus sayd: I am come to iudgement
into thys worlde y• they whiche
see not, might see: And that they which
see, myghte be made blynde. And some
of the Pharises that were with hym,
heard this, and sayd vnto him: Are we
then blynde also? Iesus sayd vnto thē:
If ye were blynde ye shoulde haue no
synne, but nowe that ye saye: we see,
therfore your synne remayneth.

This prouerbe spake Iesus vnto thē:

Iesus vnto theym agayne: Uerelye,

playnelye. Iesus aunswered theym. I
tolde you, and ye beleue not, the workes

he deuided the good vnto the. And not
longe thereafter, the yonger sonne gathered
all together, and toke hys iourney
in to a far countrey, and there wasted
he his goodes with riotus lyuing.
Nowe whan he had spente all that he
had, there was a greate dearth thorow
out al the same lande. And he beganne
to lacke, and wente his waye and did
eleaue vnto a citesyn of the same countrey,

ynoughe, and I peryshe of hunger? I
wyll get vp, and go to my father and
say vnto hym. Father, I haue synned agaynst
heauen and before the, & am no

he gat him vp, and came to his father.
But whan he was yet a great way of,
hys father sawe hym, and had compassion,

But the father sayde vnto hys seruaū

And they began to be mery. But the
elder sonne was in the felde, and whan
he came and drew nye to the house, he
hearde the minstrelsye and daunsinge,
and called one of the seruauntes vnto
hym, and asked what it was. He sayde
vnto hym, thy brother is come home,
and thy father hathe slayne a fed calfe,
because he hath receaued hym safe and
sounde. Then was he angry, and wold
not goo in. Then wente hys father
oute and prayed hym. But he aunswered

                  HE sayde also vnto his disciples:
There was a certayne ryche
man,Luke which had a stewarde that
 was accused vnto hym, that he
had wasted his goddes. And he called
hym, and sayde vnto hym: what is it
that I heare this of thee
                        •
                      geue accomptes
of thy stewardeship, for thou maist
be no longer stewarde. The stewarde
sayde wythin hym selfe. What shall I
do? My Lorde wyl take awaye the stewardship
fro me. I cannot dygge, and
to begge I am ashamed, I wote what
I wyll do, that whan I am put oute of
the stewardeshyppe they maye receaue
me into their houses. And he called vnto
hym all his lordes detters, and sayd
vnto the fyrste. How much owest thou
vnto my Lorde? He sayde an hundreth

                     onne of oyle. And he sayd, take thy bil,
syt downe quickly, and wryte fyftye.
Then sayde he vnto another

                      Howe

                      he sayd an hūdreth
quarters of wheate. He sayd vnto him,

take thy bil, and wryte foure score, and
the Lorde commaunded the vnryghteous
steward, because he had done wysely.
For the chyldren of this worlde, are

of lyghte. And I saye vnto you, make
you frendes wyth the vnryghteous
Mammon, that whan ye haue nede,
they may receaue you into euerlasting
tabernacles. He that is faythful in the
leaste, is faythfull also in muche: and
he that is vnryghteous in the leaste, is
vnrighteous also in the muche. Yf ye
then haue not bene faythfull in the vnryghteous
Mammon, who wil beleue
you in that whiche is true
                        •

busynesse: Who wyl geue you y• which

two masters for either he shal hate the
one, and loue the other, or els he shall
leaue to the one and despyse the other,
ye cannot serue God and Mammon.

vnto them, ye are they that iustyfye
youre selues before menne, but
GOD knoweth youre heartes:

For that whiche is hye amonge menne
is an abhominacion before God. The
lawe and the Prophetes propheryed

The ryche manne dyed also,
and was buryed in hell. Nowe whan
he was in hell, he lyfte vp hys eyes in

he cryed and sayde: Father Abraham,
haue mercye vpon me, and sende Lazarus
that he maye dyppe the typpe

flame. But Abraham sayde, remember
sonne that thou haste receaued good in

receaued euell. But nowe is he comforted,
and thou arte tormented.
                  And besyde all this, there is a greate
space set betwene vs and you, so that

Then sayde he, I praye thee then father,
that thou wylte sende hym vnto

nay father Abrahā, but if one wēt unto

hym, and sayde: Lorde beholde,
He whome thou loueste lyeth sycke.
                  Whan Iesus hearde that, he sayde:
This sycknesse is not vnto deathe, but
for the prayse of GOD, that the

sonne of GOD maye be praised there
thorow. Iesus loued Martha, and her
syster, and Lazarus. Nowe whan he
hearde that he was sycke, he abo

Iohn had baptysed.] Afterwarde sayd he
vnto hys dyscyples, let vs go againe
into Iewrye. His dysciples sayde vnto
hym: Master lately would the Iewes
haue stoned thee, and wylte thou go
thyther agayne? Iesus aunswered.
                  Are there not twelue hours in the day
                        •
                     
He that walketh in the daye stombleth
not, for he seeth the lyghte of thys
worlde. But he that walketh in the
nyght, stombleth, for there is no lyghte
in him. This he spake, and afterwarde
sayde he vnto them, Lazarus our frēde
slepeth, but I go to wake hym oute of
slepe. Then sayde hys dyscyples. Lord
yf he slepe, he shall do well ynoughe.
Howe be it Iesus spake of hys deathe:
but they thoughte that he had spoken
of the bodely slepe. Then sayde Iesus
unto them playnly, Lazarus is deade,
and I am glade for youre sakes that
I was not there, that ye maye beleue:
Neuerthelesse let vs go vnto hym.
                  Then sayde Thomas whiche is called

Didimus, vnto the dyscyples. Let vs
go also, that we maye dye wyth hym.
                  Then came Iesus and founde that he
had lyen in the graue foure dayes alreadye.
Bethany was nye vnto Ierusalem
aboute syxtene furlonges. And
manye of the Iewes were come to
Martha, and Mary to comforte them
ouer their brother. Nowe when Martha
hearde that Iesus came, she wente
to mete him, but Mary sat stil at home.
Then said Martha vnto Iesus: Lord,
yf thou haddest bene here, my brother
had not bene deade: But neuerthelesse
I knowe also, that what soeuer thou
askest of God, that God wyll geue it
thee. Iesus sayde vnto her. Thy brother
shall ryse agayne: Martha sayde
vnto him. I knowe that he shall ryse agayne
in the resurreccion at the laste
daye. Iesus sayde vnto her, I am the
resurreccion and the lyfe. He that beleueth
on me, shall lyue, thoughe he
were deade alreadye: and who so euer
lyueth, and beleueth on me, shal neuer
dye: beleuest thou this? She sayde vnto
hym, ye Lorde, I beleue that thou arte
Christe the sonne of GOD, whyche
shoulde come into the worlde.
                  
                     And whan she had sayde this, she went
hir waye, and called Mary her syster
secretly and said. The master is come,
and calleth for the. She whan she herd
that, rose vp quyckly and come vnto
hym, for Iesus was not yet come in
to the towne, but was yet in y• place wher
Martha met hym. The Iewes that
were with her in the house and comforted
her, when they saw Mary that
she rose vp hastely and wente out, they
folowed & sayd: she goeth to the graue
to wepe there. Now when Mary came
where Iesus was, and sawe hym, she
fell downe at hys fete and sayd: Lord,
yf thou haddest bene here, my brother
had not bene deade. Whan Iesus saw
her wepe and the Iewes wepynge also
that came with her, he groned in
the spirite, and was sory wyth in hym
selfe, and sayde, where haue ye layed
hym: They sayde, Lorde come and se,
& Iesus wept. Then sayd the Iewes,
beholde howe he loued hym, but some
of them sayde, could not he, whiche opened
the eyes of y• blynde, haue made
also, that thys man shoulde not haue
dyed
                        •
                      But Iesus groned againe in
hym selfe, and came to the graue, it

was a caue, and a stone layed on it. Iesus
sayd: take away the stone. Martha
the syster of him that was deade,
sayde vnto hym: Lorde he stinketh alreadye,
for he hathe bene deade foure
dayes. Iesus sayd vnto her: sayd I not
vnto thee, that yf thou dyddest beleue,
thou shouldest see the glorye of God:
Then toke they away the stone, where
the deade laye: Iesus lyfte vp his eyes,
and sayde: Father I thanke thee, that
thou haste hearde me. Howe be it, I
knowe that thou hearest me alwaye:
but because of ye people that stande by,
I sayde it, that they maye beleue, that
thou haste sente me: whan he had sayd
thys, he cryed lowde, Lazarus come
forthe. And the deade came forthe
bounde hande and foote with graue
clothes: and his face bounde wyth a
napkyn. Iesus sayde vnto them:
lowse hym, and lette hym goo. Many
now of the Iewes whiche were come
vnto Marye, and sawe what Iesus
dyd, beleued on him. But some of them
wente theyr waye vnto the Pharyses,
and tolde theym what Iesus hadde

come and take awaye oure lande and
people: but one of them named Cayphas,
whiche was hyghe prieste the

for the people onely, but that he should
gather together the chyldren of God,

From that daie fourth they toke counsel
how they myght put him to death.

Iesus walked no more openly among
the Iewes, but went from thence in to
a countrey by the wyldernesse, to a cytie
called Ephraim, & there had he his
beynge wyth his disciples. The Iewes
Easter was nye at hande, and there
went vp many to Ierusalem, oute of

father praysed, that ye bringe fourthe
much frute, and become my disciples.
Lyke as my father hathe loued me, euen
so haue I loued you: continue in
my loue: yf ye kepe my commaundemētes
ye shal cōtinue in my loue, like
as I haue kept my fathers cōmaundementes,
& continue in his loue. These
thinges haue I spoken vnto you, that
my ioye myght remayne in you, and
that youre ioy might be perfect. This
is my commaundemente that ye loue
together, as I haue loued you. No mā
hathe greater loue, then to set hys lyfe
for his frende, ye are my frendes, if ye
do that I commaūde you: hence fourth
call not I you seruauntes, for a seruaunte
knoweth not what hys Lorde
doth. But I haue said: ye are frendes,
for all that I haue heard of my father,
haue I shewed vnto you: ye haue not
chosen me, but I haue chosen you, and
ordayned you that ye goo and brynge
fourthe frute, and that youre frute continue,
that whatsoeuer ye aske the father
in my name, he should geue it you.
Thys I commaunde you, that ye loue

one another. Yf the worlde hate you,
then knowe that it hathe hated me before
you: yf ye were of the worlde, the
worlde woulde loue hys owne. Howe
be it, because ye are not of the worlde,
but I haue chosen you from the world,
therfore theworlde hateth you. Remē
                  ber
my worde that I sayde vnto you:
the seruaunte is not greater then hys
Lord: yf they haue persecuted me, they
shall persecute you also: yf they haue
kept my word, they shal kepe yours also.
But al this they shal do vnto you for
my names sake, because thei know not
him yt sent me: yf I had not come & spoken
vnto them, thē should they haue no
sinne, but nowe haue they nothynge to
cloke their s
                     •
                  ne withal. He yt hateth me,
hateth my father also: yf I hadde not
done amonge them the workes which
none other man dyd, they shoulde haue
no sinne. But nowe haue they sene it,
and yet haue they hated bothe me and
my father: Neuerthelesse that the sayinge
myght be fulfylled which is written
in their lawe: they haue hated me
withoute a cause.Psal. 24 c. But whan the comforter
commeth whome I shall sende
you from the father, euen the spirit of

truthe whiche proceadeth of the father,
he shall testifye of me, and ye shall
beare wytnesse also, for ye haue bene
with me from the beginninge.
               These thinges haue I sayde vnto you,Capi. 16.
that ye shoulde not be offended? They
shall excommunicate you, the tyme cō
                  meth
that whosoeuer putteth you to
deathe, shal thinke that he doth seruice
vnto God. And suche thynges shal they
do vnto you, because they haue nother
knowen the father, nor yet me. But
these thinges haue I sayde vnto you,
that whan the tyme commeth, ye maye
thinke thereon that I tolde you: but
these thinges haue I not said vnto you
from the beginninge: for I was with
you: but nowe I go vnto him that sent
me, & none of you asketh me whether
goest thou: But because I haue sayde
these thinges vnto you, your hearte is
full of sorowe. Neuerthelesse I tel you
the truethe, it is better for you that I
go awaye, for yf I go not awaye, that
comforter commeth not vnto you: but
yf I depart I wyl send him vnto you.
And whan he commeth, he shall rebuke
the worlde of synne, and of ryghteousnesse,
and of iudgemente. Of

synne, because they beleue not on me:
Of ryghteousnesse, because I goo to
the father, and ye shall se me no more.
Of Iudgemente, because the 
                     •
                  rince
of this world is iudged already. I haue
yet muche to saye vnto you, but ye cannot
nowe beare it awaye: how be it.
Whan the spirite of truthe commeth,
he shall leade you, in to all trueth: For
he shall not speake of hym selfe, but
whatsoeuer he shall heare, that shall
he speake, and he shall shewe you
what is to come: he shall gloryfe me,
for he shall receaue of myne, and shall
shewe vnto you. All that the father
hath is myne, therefore haue I sayde,
he shall receaue of myne, and shewe
vnto you. After a lyttel whyle, and ye
shall not se me, and agayne after a lytle
while, and ye shall se me, for I goo
to the father. Then sayde some of hys
disciples amonge them selues: What
is thys that he sayeth vnto vs: after
a lytle while, and ye shall not se me,
and agayne after a lytle whyle, and
ye shall se me: For I goo to the father?
Then sayde they. What is this
that he sayth: after a lytle whyle? We
canne not tell what he sayeth.
               
                  Then perceaued Iesus that they wold
aske him, and he sayde vnto them: Ye
enquire of this amonge youre selues,
that I sayde. After a lytle while, and
ye shall not se me, and againe after a
lytle while and ye shall se me. Uerely,
verely I saye vnto you, ye shall wepe &
lament, but the world shall reioyce,
ye shalbe sory, but your sorowe shalbe
turned into ioye. A woman whan she
traueleth hathe sorow, for her houre is
come, but whan she is delyuered of her
childe, she thinketh nomore of the anguyshe
for ioye that a man is borne in
the worlde. And nowe haue ye sorowe
also, but I wyl se you againe, and your
hearte shall reioyce, and your ioye shal
noman take from you. And in that day
shall ye aske me no question, verelye,
verelye I saye vnto you, yf ye aske the
father ought in my name, he shall geue
it you. Hetherto haue ye asked nothing
in myne name: aske and ye shall receaue,
that youre ioye may be perfect:
these thinges haue I spoken vnto you
by prouerbes, neuerthelesse the tyme
commeth, that I shall speake nomore
by prouerbes, but I shall shewe you
plainlye of my father. In that daye

shall ye aske in my name, and I saye
not vnto you, that I wyll praye vnto
the father for you, for the father hym
selfe loueth you, because ye haue loued
me, and beleued that I am come oute
from God. I wente oute from the father,
and came into the worlde: againe
I leue the world, and go to the father.
His disciples sayde vnto him: beholde
nowe talkest thou playnelye, and speakest
no prouerbe: now are we sure, that
thou knowest all thinges, and nedest
not that any man should aske the, therfore
beleue we, that thou camst out frō
God. Iesus answered them: Nowe ye
do beleue, beholde, the houre draweth
nye, and is come already, that ye shalbe
scattered euery man vnto his owne
and shall leaue me alone, and yet am
I not alone, for the father is with me.
These thinges haue I spoken vnto
you, that in me ye myghte haue peace,
in the worlde ye haue trouble, but be of
good comforte, I haue ouercome the
worlde. These thinges sayde Iesus,Capi.

lyfte vp his eyes towarde heauen, and

gloryfie the. Lyke as thou haste geuen
him power ouer all flesh, that he should
geue euerlastinge lyfe to as many as
thou hast geuen him. But this is the
lyfe euerlastinge, that they know thee,
that thou onely arte the true God, and
whome thou hast sent Iesus Christ. I
haue gloryfied the vpon earth, and fynished
the worke, that 
                     •
                  hou gauest me

by thy owne selfe, with the glory which
I had or euer the worlde was. I haue
declared thy name vnto y• men whome
thou gauest me from the world. They
were thine, and thou gauest them vnto
me, and they haue kepte thy worde.
Now know they yt al thinges whatsoeuer
thou hast geuen me, are of the, for
the wordes whiche thou gauest me,
haue I geuē vnto them, and they haue
receaued them, and knowen of a truth,
that I am come forth from thee, and
haue beleued that thou haste sent me.
I pray for them, and not for the world
                     •

haue my ioye parfit in thē, I haue geuen
them thy worde, and the world hateth
them, for they are not of the world,
euen as I also am not of the worlde. I
pray not that thou shouldest take them
out of the world, but that thou kepe thē
from euell: they are not of the worlde,
as I also am not of the worlde. Sanctifie
them in thy trueth, thy word is the
truth. Lyke as thou hast sent me in to ye
world, so haue I sent thē into ye world,
and for their sakes I sanctifie my selfe
that they may also be sanctified in the
truth. Neuerthelesse I pray not for thē
onely, but also for those, which thorow
their word shall beleue in me, that they
al may be one, like as yu father artīme,
& I in the, yt they also maye be in vs, y•
ye world may beleue that yu hast sēt me.

And the Glory which thou gauest me,
haue I geuen them, that they may bee
one, lyke as we are one. I in them, and
thou in me, that they maye be perfecte
in one, and that the world may know,
that thou haste sente me, and haste
loued them, as thou haste loued
me. Father I wyll that they whome
thou hast geuen me, be with me, where
I am, that they may se my glory, which
thou haste geuen me: for thou haste loued
me, or euer the world was made.
Ryghteous father the world hath not
knowen the, but I haue knowen thee,
and these haue knowen that thou haste
sent me, and I haue declared thy name
vnto them, that ye loue wherewith thou
haste loued me, maye be in them, and
I in them.

                  (Iohn) Where there was a garden, in
to the which Iesus entred, and his disciples:
but Iudas that betrayed hym,
knewe the place also. (Mat.) And saide
vnto his disciples, sit ye here, while I
go yonder and praye. And he toke with
him Peter, and ye two sonnes of Zebede,
and began to waxe sorowfull, and
heauy, (Mark) and fearefull, and in an
agonye. (Math) Then sayde Iesus vnto
them, my soule is heauy euen vnto
deathe: tarye ye here, and watche wyth
me. (Luc) and he gat hym from them,
aboute a stones caste: (Math) and he
wente fourthe a lytle, and fell flat vpon
hys face, (Mar) vpon the grounde &
prayed that (if it wer possible) the houre
myghte passe from hym: and sayd, Abba,
my father, all thynges are possible
vnto thee, take this cuppe awaye from
me: neuerthelesse, not what I wyll, but
what thou wylte. (math) And he came
to his disciples, and foūde them a slepe,
and sayde vnto Peter. (marke) Simon
slepest thou, couldest thou not watche
with me one houre? Watch and pray,
that ye fall not into temptacion: y• sprit
is willing, but the flesh is weake. (Mat)
                  
Agayne he went the seconde tyme, and
prayed, (mar) the same wordes saying,
(math) O my father yf this cuppe cannot
passe away frō me except I drinke
it, thy wyll be fulfilled. And he came againe,
and founde thē a slepe: for their
eyes were heuye, (mar) & they knewe
not what they shoulde aunswere him.
(mat) And he left them, and went forth
agayne and prayed the third tyme, saiynge
the same wordes, (Luk) he kneled
downe, and sayd: Father yf thou wilt,
take awaye thys cuppe fro me, neuerthelesse
not my wyll, but thyne be fulfylled.
And there appeared vnto hym
an angell from heauen, and comforted
hym. And he wrestled with deathe, and
prayed the longer, and his swete was
lyke dropes of bloude, runnyng downe
to the grounde: and he rose vp from
prayer, and came to his disciples, and
founde them slepinge for heuinesse,

of the highe Preestes and ministers,
he came thether with cressettes, with
lanterns, and with weapens, (math)
while he yet spake: lo, Iudas Iscarioth
one of the twelue came, and with hym
a greate multitude with sweardes and

before them, and came nie vnto Iesus
to kysse him (Mar) and whan he was

master, and kissed him, and Iesus said
vnto him, frende wherefore arte thou

sonne of man with a kysse (Iohn) Iesus
nowe knowinge all that shoulde

Nowe whan Iesus sayde vnto them,

sayde Iesus of Nazareth. Iesus aunswered,
I haue told you, that I am he:
Yf ye seke me, then let these goo theyr
waye, that the word myght be fulfilled
whiche he sayde. Of them whome thou
gauest me, haue I not loste one: (math)
Then came they,Iohn. 17. b. and layed handes vpon
Iesus and toke him. (Luc) When
they that were aboute him, sawe what

Lorde, shall we smite with the sweard?
(Iohn) Simon Peter, (Luk) one of thē,
(Iohn) Had a swearde, and drewe it
oute, and smote the high Preestes seruaunt,
and cut of his ryght eare. (Luke)
But Iesus answered, and sayde, suffer
them thus far fourthe. (Iohn) And the
seruauntes name was Malchus: then
sayde Iesus vnto Peter: put vp thy
swearde in to thy sheeth. Shall I not
drynke of the cuppe, whiche my father
hath geuen me? (Mat) for all that take
the swearde, shall peryshe with the
sweard. Or thinkest thou that I can
not praye my father now to sende me

more then twelue legiōs of aūgels? but
how thē shold ye scriptures be fulfilled?
For thus muste it be. (Ioh) And he touched
his eare, and healed hym: but Iesus
sayde vnto the Priestes and rulers
of the tēple, and to the elders that were
come vnto him. Ye are come fourth, as
it were to a murtherer with sweardes
and staues: I was daylye with you in
the temple, and ye laied no handes vpon
me (Math.) I satte and taughte,
and ye toke me not, (Luke) but this is
your houre, and the power of darkenesse,
(Math) but all thys is done, that
the scriptures of the prophetes myghte

and captayne, and the officers of y•

folowed hym, a yonge manne, which
was clothed in linnen vpon the bare

Neuerthelesse they helde a counsell,

They aunswered and sayde vnto him:
yf he were not an euel doer, we had not
delyuered him vnto thee. Then sayde
Pilate vnto them. Take ye him: and

accuse him, & said: we haue founde this
fellow peruertīg ye people: & forbidding
to geue tribute vnto ye Emperour, & he
saith yt he is Christ a king. But Pilate
asked him & sayd: art yu the kinge of the
Iewes? He answerd him & said. Thou
sayst it. Pilate sayde vnto ye high preestes,
& to ye people: I fynde no cause in

hearde mention of Galile, he asked
whether he were of Galile. And whan
he parceaued that he was vnder Herodes
iurisdiction, he sente him to Herode,
whiche was also at Ierusalem inthose
dayes. Whan Herode sawe Iesus,
he was exceadinge glade, for he
had longe bene desirous to se him, because
he had herd much of him, & hoped
to se a miracle of him. And he asked hī
many thinges, neuerthelesse he answered
nothing. The hie preestes & Scribes
stode, and accused him sore: but Herode
with his mē of war despised him

Upon the same day wer Pilate & Herode
made frendes together, for before
they had bene at variaunce. Pilate called
the hie preestes, and the rulers, and
ye people together, & sayd vnto them, ye
haue broughte this manne vnto me, as
one that peruerteth ye people: & behold,
I haue examined him before you, and
finde in the mā none of ye causes, where
of ye accuse him. Nor yet Herode, for
I sent you to him, and behold, there is
brought vpō him nothing yt is worthy
of death. Therfore I wil chastē him, &
let him louse. (Iohn) Then entred Pilate
in to the counsel hall againe, & called
Iesus, and sayd vnto him. Art yu the
king of ye Iewes? Iesus answered: sayest
thou yt of thy self, or haue other tolde
it the of me? Pilate answered: am I a
Iewe? Thy people & the high priestes
haue deliuered the vnto me: what hast
yu done? Iesus answered: my kīgdōe is
not of this world, if my kingdōe wer of
this world, my ministers would fyght
therfore, yt I shold not be deliuered vnto
ye Iewes. But now my kingdome is
not frō hence. Thē said Pilat vnto him

Arte thou a kynge then? Iesus answered:
thou sayest it, for I am a king. For
this cause was I borne, and came into
the worlde, that I shoulde testifie the
truth. Whosoeuer is of the truth, heareth
my voyce. Pilate sayde vnto him:
What is the trueth? And whan he had
sayde that, he went oute againe to the
Iewes, and sayde vnto them. I fynde
no cause in him. (Math) And when he
was accused of the hie priestes and Elders,
he answered nothinge. Then said
Pilate vnto him. (Mar) And asked him
againe, and sayde: answerest thou nothinge?
(Math) Then sayde Pilate vnto
him, hearest thou not how sore they
accuse the? (Mark) beholde, in how manye
thinges they accuse the? (math) and
he answered hym not one worde, in so
muche that Pilate the debite marueled
excedinglye. At the solempne feaste
the debite was wonte to delyuer a prisoner
fre
                     •
                   vnto the people, whome they
woulde, (Mark) and whome they wold
desire, (Luke) he must nedes let lowse.
(Mat) And at ye same tyme he had a notable
prisoner, called Barrabas: (mar)
and the people wente vp and prayed
him that he would do as he was wont.

                  (Mat) And whē they wer gathred, together
Pilate sayd: (Ioh) ye haue a custōe
that I shoulde geue one vnto you louse
at Easter (Mat) whether will ye that
I geue louse vnto you, Barrabas, or
Iesus whiche is also called Christe?
For he knewe well that they had delyuered
him of enuye. But the hie preestes
and the elders moued the people,
that they shoulde aske Barrabas, and
destroye Iesus. Then aunswered the
debite, and sayde vnto them: whether
of these two wyll ye that I geue louse
vnto you? They sayd Barrabas (Ioh)
yet was Barrabas a these, (Luke) the
whiche for an insurreccion made in the
cytie, and because of a murther was
caste in to prison. Then called Pilate
vnto them agayne, and would haue let
Iesus louse, (math) what shal I do then
with Iesus whiche is called Christe?
They sayd all, let him be crucified: the
debite sayde, what euell hathe he done?
but they cried yet the more, (Luke) crucifie
him, crucifie him. Yet saide he vnto
them the thirde tyme: what euell
hath he done? I fynde no cause of death
in hym, therfore wyll I chasten hym,
and lette him god. (Iohn) Then Pilate

toke Iesus, and scourged him, and
(Math) the debites soudiours toke Iesus
in to the commune hall, and gathered
the whole multitude ouer him, and
striped him oute of his clothes, and put
a purple robe vpon him, and plated a
crowne of thorne, and sette it vpon his
heade, and a rede in his hande, and
kneled before him, and mocked him,
and sayde: hayle kinge of the Iewes,
spitted vpon hym, and toke the rede,
and smote him vpon the heade, (Iohn)
and smote him on the face. Then
wente Pilate fourthe agayne, and
sayde vnto them: beholde I brynge
him forth vnto you, that ye may know
that I fynde no faute in him. So Iesus
wente fourthe, and dyd weare a
crowne of thorne, and a purple robe.
And he sayde vnto them: beholde the
man. Whan the hye preestes and mynisters
sawe him, they cryed and sayd:
crucifie, crucifie hym. Pilate sayde
vnto them. Take ye hym, and crucifie
hym: for I fynde no giltinesse in hym.L

The Iewes aunswered him, we haue
a lawe, and after oure lawe he ought
to dye: because he made hym selfe the

sonne of God. Whan Pilate hearde
that worde, he was the more afraied:
and wente agayne in to the commune
hall. And sayde vnto Iesus: whence art
thou? but Iesus gaue him no answere.
Then sayde Pilate vnto him, speakest
thou not vnto me? knowest thou not,
that I haue power to crucifie thee, and
haue power to louse the? Iesus answered.
Thou shouldest haue no power vpon
me, yf it were not geuen thee from
aboue. Therfore he that delyuered
me vnto thee, hathe the more synne.
From that tyme for the Pilate sought
meanes to louse him. But the Iewes
cried and sayde, yf thou lette him go,
thou arte not the Emperours frende:
For whosoeuer maketh hym selfe a
kynge, is againste the Emperoure.
Whan Pilate hearde that worde, he
broughte Iesus forthe, and satte him
downe vpon the iudgemente seate,
in the place whyche is called the
pauemente, but in the Hebrue, Gabatha.
(Math) And whan he satte
vpon the iudgemente seate, hys wyfe
sente vnto him, saying: haue yu nothing
to do wyth that ryghteous man: for I

haue suffred many thinges this day in
a dreame, because of him. (mar) It was
aboute the thirde houre, (Ioan) and he
sayde vnto the Iewes: beholde youre
kinge: but they cried, awaye with him,
awaye with him, crucifie him: Pilate
sayde vnto them. Shal I crucifie your
kynge? The highe preestes answered,
we haue no kinge but the Emperour.
(math) So whan Pilate sawe that he
coulde not helpe, but that, (Luke) with
greate cryes, (Mat) there was a greate
vprore: he toke water and washed hys
handes, before the people and sayd, I
am vngiltie of the bloude of this ryghteous
man, se ye thereto. Then answered
all the people and sayde, his bloude
come vpon vs, and vpon oure children,
Then (marke) Pilate thoughte to satisfie
the people, (Luke) and gaue sentence
that it shoulde be as they required,
and let louse Barrabas vnto them
that for insurrectiō and murther was
cast into prison, whome they desyred,
but gaue Iesus ouer vnto their wyll,
(Mark.) that they mighte crucifie hym.
(Mat) Thē the debites souldiours toke
Iesus into the cōmon hal, & gathered y•
whole multitude together (Mark) and

clothed him with purple and plated a
crowne of thorne, and crowned hym
withall, and began to salute him: hayle
kyng of y• Iewes, and smote him vpō y•
heade with a reede, and spytted vpon
hym, (Mathe) and kneled before him,
and mocked hym, and after they hadde
mocked hym, (Marke) they tooke the

hym a great multitude of people,

and of women, whiche bewayled and
lamented him. But Iesus turned hym
abouce vnto them, and sayde: ye doughters

but wepe ouer youre selues, and ouer
your children. For beholde, the tyme
wyll come, wherein it shall be sayde:

stode a vessel full of vineger. (mat) And

toke a sponge and fylled it with vineger,

Whiche also leaned vpon his brest

Then wente there oute a sayinge amonge
