            TO THE WORSHIPFVLL AND his worthy friend M. TIMOTHY CHALONER, a great louer of learning.
            
            
               
                  PHiloſtratus, a famous Philoſopher, writing ſomtimes to a Noble young man, vſeth theſe words: Cauendum eſſe ne temporis preciū ſine fructu praetereat:
               
and Nazianzenus ſayth, that our time beeing but ſhort, and yet precious, is not careleſly, and negligently to be let ſlip; but that euerie man in his Place, and Calling, is to doe ſome good to the Countrie & Commonwealth wherein hee was borne. For which cauſe, I haue taken ſome paines in the publicatiō of theſe Aphoriſms; a worke very needfull to be known, and vnderſtood, by all ſorts of people: and as Leonardus Fucchius witneſſeth, the beſt worke that euer Hip. compiled;

wiſhing that all Phyſicians and Chirurgions, ſhould carrie them in their boſoms: as it is reported of Tully, concerning the Comedies of Terence, tanquam in ſinu portare, & to haue them at their fingers ends.
            Theſe Aphoriſmes were firſt of all written in the Greek, and ſince tranſlated into Latine by many excellent and learned Phyſicians, and are dailie ſet forth with large Comments: which doth ſhew vnto vs their excellencie and worthineſſe. For a man may by them

preſerue himſelfe from ſickneſſe being in health, and being ſick cure himſelfe of ſickneſſe.
            Accept therfore I pray you of theſe Labours, which I for the benefit of my Country haue vndertaken to make common: which if you ſhall ſo do, I ſhall little eſteem of the venemous teeth of anie carper. For, to you onely I preſent them as a token of my loue, & affection, which I beare vnto you: not for many fauours which I haue receiued from you, but for your many vertues and

loue of learning which is known to be in you. For (truly) I doe not knowe to whome bookes may better be preſented, then to thoſe that loue books, whereof I knowe you to haue manie; a great ritches to you, but little regarded with thouſands of your rank. But I leaue to trouble you: and wiſhing you as many happy yeeres, as you haue vertues, I commit you to the Almightie his protection.
            
               Yours, S. H.
               
            
         
         
            
            
            To the vnderſtanding Reader.
            
               I Doubt not (gentle Reader) but thou art very well acquainted with the hardnes of tranſlation, and how vneaſie it it is to tranſlate a Greeke Authour into our engliſh tongue, that it ſhould carrie that grace and elegancie, as in the original. For as a fruitfull tree being remoued out of a fertile ſoyle, into a barren, doth

rather wither 
                  ••
               d become vnfruitfull, then to bring forth ſuch and the like kinde of fruit as formerly it did; ſo dooth it happen with a diuerſe tranſlation: ſo that the firſt tranſlation cannot haue the grace of the originall, nor a ſecond tranſlation, that of the firſt, but muſt needs ſeem more harſh and barraine then the firſt: So I feare me it will happen with theſe Aphoriſms, which were firſt written in Greeke by the Authour, and after in latine, and now as thou ſeeſt in Engliſh. Wherefore

if thou doſt finde any faults committed, or anie miſtaking in the tranſlation, my requeſt is that thou wilt rather winke at a ſmall fault, vntill it may be amended, then to carpe with Zoilus, and doe nothing thy ſelfe. Well, what the labour hath beene to the Tranſlator, ſapientum ſit iudicium; this I am ſure, it is for thy profit if thou liſt, and for the benefit of all ſuch as doe not vnderſtand eyther greeke or latine. And if thou accept of this worke kindely, thou mayſt haue it hereafter in better faſhion,

and perhaps with a Comment. In the meane time vſe theſe, and let the Tranſlator haue thy good word: and ſo fare thou well.

                  The Argument of the 1. Section.
                  
                  THis firſt Section of Aphoriſmes dooth handle for the moſt part the Dietarie part of Phyſicke; preſcribing not onely the meaſure & obſeruation in meates and drinks for ſoūd bodies, but alſo for thoſe bodies that are ſicke and diſeaſed, with a moderation alſo of labour and exerciſe.
               
               
                  
                  
                     Aphoriſme. 1.
                  THe life of man is ſhort, the Arte of Phyſicke long, occaſion ſuddaine, experiēce vncertain, iudgement difficult. Neither is it ſufficient that the Phyſicion do his office, vnleſſe alſo the Patient, and thoſe which are attēdants about him doe their dutie, and that outward things bee as well ordered as thoſe that are giuen inwardly.
               
               
                  [2]
                  In diſtempratures, looſneſſe, flux of the bellie, and vomitings, which do come of their owne accorde; if thoſe things bee purged which ought to be purged, they are eaſily ſuffered, &

are profitable: but if it bee otherwiſe it falleth out contrarie. In like ſort if ſuch an emptying of veſſells be done as ſhould be, it is well ſuffered: but otherwiſe it is hurtfull. Wherefore, diſcreet conſideration is to be had, both of the region & the time, as alſo of the age and the qualitie of the diſeaſe for which ſuch things ought to be euacuated, or elſe not.
               
               
                  [3]
                  The full habit and ſtate of the bodies of wreſtlers and Champions if it come to the higheſt degree of fulneſſe is dangerous, for it cannot continue or remain in the ſame ſtate: and when it cannot ſo remaine, nor

growe into a better habit, it remayneth that it muſt needs decline into a worſe. Wherefore that ouer-full plight of body muſt be ſpeedily diſſolued, to the end it may take a beginning of new nouriſhment: Neither muſt we proceed ſo far that the veſſells be quite empty & voyd (for that is dangerous) but we muſt proceed ſo farre as Nature wil beare & tolerate. So, extream euacuations are perilous, & ſo again extream repletions are likewiſe dangerous.
               
               
                  [4]
                  A ſmall & ſlender diet, in long & lingering diſeaſes is alwaies dangerous: & ſo in ſharp ſickneſſe when it is not conuenient. And

againe diet reduced to extream ſlēderneſs is as ful of peril as extream repletiō & fulneſs is laborious & painfull.
               
               
                  [5]
                  The ſick may offend in a ſlender diet: for thereby it hapneth that they growe worſe; for euery error in this caſe is wont to prooue more daungerous, then ſhould be. Wherfore a very ſlender diet and too preciſe is ſomwhat dangerous to a ſound & healthfull bodie, becauſe they endure the errors therof with more difficultie. Wherefore a thin & exact maner of diet for the moſt part is more dangerous then that which is a little more full and plentifull then ſhould be.
               
               
                  
                  [6]
                  To extream diſeaſes extream and exquiſite remedies are the beſt.
               
               
                  [7]
                  Whē therfore the diſeaſe is ſharpe, & hath forthwith moſt extreame paines and paſſions, we muſt vſe a moſt exceeding ſlender dyet when it is ſo: but in the cō
                     trarie wee may miniſter a fuller, and giue more nouriſhment: and as the diſeaſe ſhall decline wee may remit the manner of thinne dyet, by little and little, & giue the patiēt more meat.
               
               
                  [8]
                  When the force of the diſeaſe is greateſt, then a moſt ſparing diet is to bee kept and obſerued.
               
               
                  
                  [9]
                  But we muſt coniecture by the ſicke-man, whether he be able to hold out, and perſiſt with the preſcribed diet, euen to the ſtate and vttermoſt extreamitie of the diſeaſe, or may faint or faile, and being too weake with ſuch diet may yeelde the victorie to the diſeaſe, before it retire & be quayled.
               
               
                  [10]
                  In diſeaſes which ſhall come inſtantly to their ſtate, we muſt inſtantlie adminiſter ſlender diet, but in the which ſhal not come ſo ſoone to ſtate, wee muſt a little diminiſh dyet: both in the time of the vigor, & extremitie, and alſo a little

about the time of the fit: but before wee may allow more liberall diet, that the ſicke man may bee able to holde out.
               
               
                  [11]
                  In fits and their fierce inuaſions, we muſt take away meat; for then to giue it, it is hurtfull: and when diſeaſes do returne by circuit, or courſe, in the recourſe of thoſe fits wee muſt vſe abſtinence.
               
               
                  [12]
                  The diſeaſes themſelues, & the ſeaſons of the yeer, & the obſeruation of the proportion of the periods beween themſelues, whether they bee made daily or by certaine daies returning by courſe, as the ſecond or euery

other day, or by greater diſtāce of time, wil ſhew the ſharp inuaſions & ſtate of the diſeaſes. Likewiſe, ſignes & tokens are taken frō thoſe things which doe appeare afterwards. As for example, in a Pluriſy, if the corrupt matter auoided by ſpitting doe preſently appeare in the beginning, it declareth the diſeaſe ſhall be but ſhort; but if it bee longer before it do appeare it declareth to continewe longer. Moreouer vrines, the excremēts of the belly and ſweats doe declare and ſhew the diſeaſes to proue either eaſie or difficult, ſhort, or long.
               
               
                  
                  [13]
                  Verie olde men do moſt eaſilie in dure faſting, and next to thē thoſe of middle age, young men not ſo wel, children worſt of all; and amongſt thē chiefly thoſe which are of the more chearefull, quicke and liuely nature then the reſt.
               
               
                  [14]
                  They which growe and increaſe haue great ſtore of naturall heate: therfore becauſe they neede plentifull and copious nouriſhment, we muſt aboundantly ſupply the ſame: otherwiſe the bodie is conſumed. But in olde men there remaineth but little heate: therfore, they need not ſo much noriſhmēt to kindle the ſame,

for a ſmall fire is extinguiſhed with aboundance of fewel: for that cauſe feuers which happen to olde folk are not ſo ſharpe becauſe their bodies are not ſo hoat.
               
               
                  [15]
                  The venters by nature are moſt hoat in winter and the ſpring time & the ſleeping moſt long: wherfore at thoſe ſeaſons wee ought to afford moſt meat, becauſe they haue moſt naturall heate: wherby it commeth to paſs that they need more aboundant and plentifull food. Of which thing the differences of ages and the bodies of Champions and wreſtlers are manifeſt arguments.
               
               
                  
                  [16]
                  A moiſt diet is profitable to all perplexed with agues; but eſpecially to children & others which haue accuſtomed to vſe ſuch diet.
               
               
                  [17]
                  We muſt conſider whom it may bee conuenient to feede once or twiſe, more, or leſſe, and by little & little: we muſt attribute ſomething to the ſeaſon, region, ages and cuſtome.
               
               
                  [18]
                  Sickely folke doe moſt hardly brook ſtore of meat in ſommer, in winter moſt eaſily, in the ſpring time not ſo eaſily.
               
               
                  [19]
                  Nothing muſt be giuen

to them, neither muſt they bee conſtrayned to take meat which haue fits returning at certaine determined courſes: but we ought to diminiſh foode before manifeſt tokens appeare to iudge of the diſeaſe.
               
               
                  [20]
                  We ought not to moue, alter, or change thoſe things which are, or haue beene iuſtly determined by nature, either with medicines or other procurements, but to let them alone.
               
               
                  [21]
                  Carry thoſe things which are to be drawne out, thither whither they ſhall ſeeme to incline, and bend, by ſuch wayes and places fitteſt for cōueiance & expulſion.
               
               
                  
                  [22]
                  We muſt moue with medicine thoſe things which are concocted & digeſted; and not thoſe things which are rawe and vndigeſted: Neither in the beginning of diſeaſes vnleſſe they be prouoked by their owne force and violence, which verie ſeldome commeth to paſſe.
               
               
                  [23]
                  Things euacuated and purged are not to be eſtimated by the multitude, but aduiſedly to be conſidered if thoſe things be auoided & ſent forth which ſhould & ought to be, and if alſo the Patient doe eaſily indure it. Alſo when it is needfull we muſt euacuate

euen to ſouning & fainting of life, if the Patient be Meaning bloud-letting.able to indure it.
               
               
                  [24]
                  In ſharpe diſeaſes, and in their beginning we ought ſeldome to vſe a purging medicine: Neither muſt it be done without great aduiſe & iudgement.
               
               
                  [25]
                  If thoſe things be auoided and purged vvhich ſhould be, it doth good & the ſick can eaſily ſuffer it: but if the contrarie be euacuated, they do painefully indure it.
               
               The end of the firſt ſection of the Aphoriſms. Now foloweth the ſecond.
            
            
               
               
                  The Argument of the ſe
                     cond Section of Aphoriſms.
                  THIS ſecond Section, of which the vniuerſal and ful ſcope, or intention cannot well be aſſigned and ſet downe, hath many things appertayning to the Doctrine of Ages, Signes, Nature & purgation.
               
               
                  [1]
                  IF ſleepe bring paine and labour in the diſeaſe, it is a mortall ſigne: but if it bring eaſe and mitigation of paine the ſigne is not deadly.
               
               
                  
                  [2]
                  When a Delirium & rauing, is appeaſed by ſleep it is a good ſigne.
               
               
                  [3]
                  Sleepe and watching, if they be immoderat & ſhal exceed a mean, are euill.
               
               
                  [4]
                  Neither ſatietie, neither hunger, neither anie other thing which ſhall exceede the meaſure of nature, can be good or healthfull.
               
               
                  [5]
                  Wearineſſe and dulneſs proceeding of their owne accord do ſignifie diſeaſes to come.
               
               
                  [6]
                  They which ſuffer pain of any part of the bodie, and doe not almoſt feele

the paine haue their vnderſtanding diſtempered and diſeaſed.
               
               
                  [7]
                  Bodies extenuated and waſted with long ſickneſs are to bee reſtored and refreſhed by little and little: but thoſe which haue been brought lowe quickly and in ſhort time are ſooner to be reſtored.
               
               
                  [8]
                  If any man eating meate after a ſickneſſe, doth not recouer ſtrength; it argueth his bodie is burdened and oppreſſed with too much ſtore of food: But if the ſame happē to one feeding meanely, we muſt vnderſtand that he hath need of euacuation.
               
               
                  
                  [9]
                  By how much the more thou ſhalt nouriſh & cheriſh impure & corrupt bodies, by ſo much the more thou ſhalt harme and hurt them.
               
               
                  [10]
                  He which will purge bodies muſt make them fluxible and apt to flovve before.
               
               
                  [11]
                  It is more eaſie to be reſtored with drink thē with meate.
               
               
                  [12]
                  Thoſe things which are left behind after the Cryſis in the bodie after ſickneſs, they are wont to bring forth back-ſliding diſeaſes againe.
               
               
                  
                  [13]
                  The night which goeth before the fitte and inuaſion is wont to bee tedious and grieuous to them to whom the Cryſis is cauſed, but the night following is wont to be more eaſie and light.
               
               
                  [10]
                  The alteration of the excrementes not made to the worſe part, in the fluxes of the bellie is good.
               
               
                  [15]
                  When the vpper parts of the throate or gullet are ſore, or a breaking out of wheales do ariſe in the bodie, it behooueth vs to look vpon the excrements: for if they ſhall be cholericke

the bodie is alſo ſick: but if they ſhall be like the excrements of ſound perſons the bodie may bee cheriſhed without danger.
               
               
                  [16]
                  When hunger beareth ſwaie, wee muſt reſt from much ſtirring or labour.
               
               
                  [17]
                  When ouermuch meate is receiued againſt nature, it cauſeth ſickneſſe: as the manner of curing diſeaſes, proceeding from repletion doth declare.
               
               
                  [18]
                  The excretions and auoydings of excrements are wont to bee quick, if they come of thoſe things which doe nouriſh ſpeedily and plentifully.
               
               
                  
                  [19]
                  Praedictions and foretellings of death or health in ſharp diſeaſes are not altogether certaine.
               
               
                  [20]
                  They which in young age haue their bellie moiſt and looſe, in old age haue it drie and hard: and contrariwiſe they which beeing young men haue their wombe or bellie drie and coſtyue, being aged haue the ſame moyſt and laxe.
               
               
                  [21]
                  Drinking of ſtrong wine putteth away hunger.
               
               
                  [22]
                  Diſeaſes which are bred of ſacietie and ſurfeting are cured by euacuation: and thoſe which proceed from

emptineſs are cured by fulneſs: and in other things, contraries are the remedies of cō
                     traries.
               
               
                  [23]
                  Acute and ſharpe diſeaſes are iudged and determined within fourteen daies (and haue their Cryſis.)
                  
               
               
                  [24]
                  The fourth daie is the Index of the ſeuenth: the eightth daie the beginning of the week following. Alſo the eleuenth daie is to be conſidered, for that is the fourth day of the ſecond week. And againe, the ſeuenteenth day is to be conſidered, for that is the iiij▪ from the fowrteenth, and the ſeuenth from the eleuenth.
               
               
                  
                  [25]
                  The Quartan feuers of the ſummer are for the moſt part ſhort: but the Autumnal long; eſpecially thoſe which remaine vnto the winter: which are moſt long.
               
               
                  [26]
                  It is better that a feuer ſhould ſucceed a conuulſion, then that a conuulſion ſhould ſucceed a feuer.
               
               
                  [27]
                  We ought not to be too confident, if anie thing more eaſie & light do happen in ſharp diſeaſes without any great reaſon: neither to be troubled if anie thing more greeuous doe ſuddenlie fall out. For, manie ſuch things are vncertaine,

neyther are they wont to perſiſt▪ and continew long.
               
               
                  [28]
                  If the body of them which haue a ſharpe feuer▪ doe abide all at one ſtay, & nothing abated, or elſe is melted and waſted awaie beyond reaſon, it is a very euil ſigne: for the firſt doth ſignifie a continuance of the diſeaſe, and the latter a great weakneſſe and imbecillitie of nature.
               
               
                  [29]
                  In the beginnings of diſeaſes, if any thing ſeeme good to be moued for euacuation, moue it: but being in their ſtate it is far better to let it alone.
               
               
                  
                  [30]
                  About the beginnings and ende of diſeaſes, all things are more calme and remiſſe: in the vigour and ſtate more vehement.
               
               
                  [31]
                  If the body thriue not to him that after a diſeaſe feedeth well, it is euill.
               
               
                  [32]
                  Thoſe which in the beginning of ſickneſſe doe feede much, and doe not proſper therewith, all ſuch for the moſt part do at laſt fall into a loathing of meat. On the contrary, thoſe which in the beginning do vehemently abhorre food, & afterwards deſire much meat, are more eaſily freed

from their ſickeneſſe.
               
               
                  [33]
                  In any diſeaſe (ſimilar, inſtrumental, or common) if reaſon be not weakened nor hurt, but that they are deſirous of thoſe things which are offered, it is good: but if it be otherwiſe it is an euill thing.
               
               
                  [34]
                  They are not ſo dangerouſly ſicke, to whoſe nature, age, habit, or ſeaſon, the diſeaſe in familiar and agreeable, as they to whom the diſeaſe is not agreeable in any of thoſe proportions.
               
               
                  [35]
                  It is better in any diſeaſe that the partes adioyning to the Nauell and nethermoſt bellie bee ſomewhat

thicke and groſſe: for the extenuation and conſumption of them is euill: and then it is not ſafe to miniſter purgatiōs working downwards.
               
               
                  [36]
                  Thoſe which are indued with health of bodie, doe quickely faint, drinking a purging potion: and ſo in like maner thoſe are impaired which do vſe naughtie and corrupt nouriſhment.

                  Thoſe meats and drinks which are worſe yet pleaſant,

are to bee preferred before thoſe which are better, but yet vnpleaſant and diſtaſting.

                  For the moſt part olde men are not ſo often ſicke as the young are. But beeing once taken with long diſeaſes they moſt commonly die of them.

                  They die ſuddenly, which doe often and exceedingly ſowne and faint without anie manifeſt cauſe.

                  Of two paines at one time not poſſeſſing the ſelf ſame place, that which is the more vehement, doth dull the ſenſe and feeling of the other which is not ſo vehement.
               
               
                  [47]
                  Whiles the filthy and corrupt matter is digeſting, paines, and agues doe rather happen, then when it is digeſted and brought to maturation.

                  It is dangerous, at one time much and ſuddenlie either to emptie, fill, heare,

or to coole, or by any other meanes to mooue or ſtirre the bodie: for any thing paſſing the bounds of mediocrity is an enemie to nature: for that is ſafe which is done by little and little, both at other times and alſo moſt eſpecially when an alteration and change is to be made from one thing to an other.

                  [54]
                  As greatnes & talneſs of of body is comelie to the ſtate of young age, ſo it is more vnprofitable than littleneſſe, & lowe ſtature, in old age.

                  Alteration and variableneſs of the ſeaſons do moſt eſpeciallie bring foorth diſeaſes, and likewiſe great alterations of colde

and heate in thoſe ſeaſons, and of other things anſwering to them in proportion.

                  Some natures are well, or ill in the ſummer ſeaſon, and others are well or ill in the winter.
               
               
                  [3]
                  Some diſeaſes are well or ill affected, ſome more to one time, and ſome to an other; & ſome ages more to ſome one time, place, & kind of dyet, then they are to an other.

                     Autumnall diſeaſes are to bee expected in theſe ſeaſons, when on the ſelfe ſame day, it is ſome times hot, and ſome times colde.

                  The South wind dulleth the hearing, obſcureth and darkneth the ſight, offendeth the head with aches and rhumes, procureth & cauſeth heauineſſe & faintneſſe in the members. Whē therefore it is frequent and bloweth often, ſuch things happen and are incident to the weak and ſicklie. Contrariwiſe▪ the North wind cauſeth coughs, exaſperateth and excoriateth the iawes, hardneth the bellie, ſuppreſſeth vrine, ſtirreth vp colde ſhiuerings, and ſhakings, ingendreth pains of the ſide and breaſt. Therfore when this wind beareth ſwaie, thoſe that are weake and feeble, muſt expect

and looke for ſuch accidents.

                  When ſommer is like the ſpring time, we muſt expect much ſweating in agues.
               
               
                  [7]
                  Sharpe Agues are ingendred with great droughts and dryneſs: and if the yeer proceed to bee ſuch as the ſtate of the ſeaſon is, which it hath affected, wee muſt expect ſuch kindes of diſeaſes.

                  In certaine and moderat times, obſeruing their ſeaſonableneſſe, certaine and ſeaſonable diſeaſes hauing a happy determination, are ingendred: But in vncertaine, wauering, and vnſeaſonable

times, vncertain diſeaſes are ingendred (whoſe Cryſis is accompanyed with grieuous accidents.

To others there hapneth

bloudy fluxes and hoat inflāmations of the eyes, and to old men rhumes which do quicklie bring deſtruction.

                  Sommer being drie and the wind northernly, Autumne full of raine and the winde ſouthernlie, vehement paines of the head are to be expected in the winter following. Alſo, coughs hoarſneſſe, and rhumes, diſtillings at the noſtrills, & to ſome pining conſumptions.

                  A northernly and drie Autumne is profitable and good to men which are moiſt by nature, and alſo to women: to others, it cauſeth

                  Of all the ſeaſons thorough-out the whole yeer, dryneſſe and droughts are more wholſome and leſſe dangerous to mans life, then daily ſhowers of raine and moiſture.

                  Daily ſeaſons of weather being northernly doe cloſe and ſtrengthen the bodies, they make them more mouable and nimble, better coloured, and more ſtrong and able in hearing: they dry & harden the belly, but they bite & offend the eies: and if any paine haue before poſſeſt the breſt, they make it more fierce and grieuous. Contrarily, ſouthernely conſtitutions doe

looſe and moyſten thoſe bodies, they dull the hearing, they bring giddineſſe of the head, they bring miſtineſſe, and dimneſs of the eyes, dulneſſe and lazineſs to the body, they make the bellie looſe and laxatiue.

               Here followeth the iiij. Section.
               
               
                  The Argument.
                  THis fourth Section is variable; but for the moſt part is reduced to euacuation and prognoſtick ſignes of future euents.
               
               
                  [1]
                  Thou ſhalt purge childbearing women if it bee needfull, at the fowrth moneth after conception, and ſo vnto the ſeauenth, but thoſe more ſparingly: but the cōception being yong or elder thou ſhalt abſtain.
               
               
                  
                  [2]
                  Such things are to bee drawn out of the body, by the vſe of purging medicines, as they are which iſſuing forth of their own accord do helpe the ſame: but thoſe which iſſue forth in a contrarie manner are to be ſtopped.
               
               
                  [3]
                  If ſuch things be purged as ſhould be, it doth good, and the patient doth eaſily indure it: but if otherwiſe it be done, the patient doth indure it painfully.
               
               
                  [4]
                  In ſommer it is more cō
                     uenient to purge the vpper venters, in the winter the inferior by ſtoole.
               
               
                  
                  [5]
                  Vnder the Canicular or or dog-ſtar, and before the dog-ſtarre, purgations are painfull anp difficil.
               
               
                  [6]
                  Leane and ſlender men are eaſie to vomit, & therefore muſt be purged by vomit, vnleſſe it be in winter.
                  7▪ Purge thoſe which do not vomit eaſilie, and being in good plight, downwards by ſtoole, ſo it be not ſommer.
               
               
                  [8]
                  Do not purge them vpwards which are ſubiect to the phtiſick or a conſumption.
               
               
                  [9]
                  Thou ſhalt purge melancholicke folke ſtrongly by ſtoole. In like manner beginning the contrarie waie

of purging. (For, light matter bending vpwards muſt be drawne out by the vpper parts: But the heauier and groſſer matter by the lower parts.)
               
               
                  [10]
                  We muſt purge in verie ſharpe ſickneſſes, if the matter do moue to the purging of it; and that the very ſame daie wherein the ſickneſſe doth begin: for delaie in ſuch diſeaſes is very hurtfull and dangerous.
               
               
                  [11]
                  Thoſe which haue gripings & wringings in the belly, and horrible paine about the Nauell and the loynes, and cannot be eaſed and diſſolued by medicin or otherwiſe, they ſhall

fall into a drie dropſie called, aqua inter cutem ſicca (which is a Timpanie.)
                  
               
               
                  [12]
                  Thoſe are not to be purged in winter by vomite without hurt, whoſe ſtomach and belly cannot retaine meate vntil it be digeſted.
               
               
                  [13]
                  Their bodies are to bee made moyſt before hand with abundance and plenty of foode and alſo with eaſe and reſt, which taking a potiō of veratrum or hellebor, do hardly and painfully vomit.
               
               
                  [14]
                  
                     Elleborus being drunke, the bodie ought rather to be moued, then to be yeelded

to ſleepe, or reſt: for the ſayling in a ſhip, doth manifeſt that our bodies are ſtirred and prouoked by motion.
               
               
                  [15]
                  When you wil haue Elleborus or veratrum to work more forcibly, mooue and ſtirre the bodie: but when you will ſtaie it, procure ſleepe, and doe not moue.
               
               
                  [16]
                  
                     Elleborus is very dangerous to them which haue ſound fleſh, for it ingendreth convulſion.
               
               
                  [17]
                  When hee which is not ſicke of an ague doth loath his meate, hath a gnawing of the mouth of the ſtomache, a darkſome gyddineſſe

of the braine, and bitterneſſe of the mouth, hit ſignifieth that he had need to be purged vpwards.
               
               
                  [18]
                  Whoſoeuer hauing need of purging hath paines about the myddryffe, it is a ſigne that hee muſt be purged vpwards: but the pains which are vnder the ſame doe note a purging downwards to be needfull.
               
               
                  [19]
                  Thoſe which doe not thirſt whiles they are purged with a medicinall potion, ſhall not leaue purging vntill they ſhall thirſt.
               
               
                  [20]
                  If there be wringings and gripings of the guttes without a feuer, heauineſſe

of the knees, and paine of the loynes, they: ſignifie that there is neede of purging downward.
               
               
                  [21]
                  Blacke excrements of the bellie like vnto blacke bloud, comming forth of their owne accord, either with a feuer or without a feuer are moſt euill: and by how much the more thoſe euill colours ſhalbe, by ſo much the more thoſe excremēts ſhall be the worſe: But ſuch things to bee expelled out by a medicin, is farre better, and that by how much the more colours there ſhalbe of them.
               
               
                  [22]
                  In the beginning of anie diſeaſe if blacke▪ choler

come forth either aboue, or beneath, it is dangerous & pernicious.
               
               
                  [23]
                  Thoſe which are pyned and brought low by ſharp or long diſeaſes, or by woundes, or anie other meanes, and doe auoyde blacke choler, or as it were blacke bloud: doe die the next daie following.
               
               
                  [24]
                  A bloudy flux if it proceed from blacke choler is mortall.
               
               
                  [25]
                  For bloud to be caried vpward of what kinde ſoeuer it be, is an euill ſigne: but if blacke bloud be egeſted & auoided downwards, it is good.
               
               
                  
                  26
                  If any man being afflicted with a blouddie fluxe doe auoide as it were little peeces of fleſh, it is a mortall ſigne.
               
               
                  27
                  To thoſe which haue ſtore of bloud flowing, frō what part ſoeuer in feuers: their bellies become moiſt, after they haue beene refreſhed.
               
               
                  28
                  Thoſe which auoid cholericke excrements downwardes, if deafeneſs come vpon the ſame they do then ceaſe frō auoiding of them: and on the other ſide, thoſe which are affected with deafnes are deliuered from the ſame, by the auoiding

of cholerick excrements.
               
               
                  [29]
                  If cold ſhakings happē to them which are ſicke of an ague the ſixt daie, they haue a difficult Cryſis, and we cannot wel iudge of the diſeaſe.
               
               
                  [30]
                  In them which are afflicted with fits of Agues, howſoeuer the ague ſhall leaue them; if it returne againe the ſame hower the next day, it is wont to haue a difficult Cryſis and determination.
               
               
                  31
                  Apoſtumes are cauſed neare the ioints, and eſpecially nigh the iawe bones, or mādible, to them which feele wearineſſe, and laſſitude in feuers.
               
               
                  
                  [32]
                  Thoſe which recouering and amending from a diſeaſe, and haue ſome place grieued with payne, ſhall haue apoſtums, or botches in the ſame place.
               
               
                  [33]
                  But if anie part ſhall be pained before the diſeaſe, the ſeate and abiding of the diſeaſe is there.
               
               
                  [34]
                  If a ſuffocation or ſtopping of the breath do happen vpon a ſodaine to one afflicted with a feuer, no ſwelling appearing in the iawes, or gullet, it is deadly.
               
               
                  [35]
                  If to one afflicted with a feuer the necke be ſuddenly

turned awrie, and he can ſcant ſwallowe, and there be no ſwelling, it is deadly.
               
               
                  [36]
                  Sweats are good to thoſe ſicke of an ague, which begin to iſſue forth the third day, fift, ſeuenth, ninth, eleuenth, fowreteenth, ſeuē
                     teenth, one and twentith, ſeuen and twentith, thirtie one, and thirty fower: for thoſe ſweats worke the diſſolution of the diſeaſe: thoſe which happen otherwiſe, ſignifie paine, and length of the diſeaſe, or a returne of the ſame.
               
               
                  [37]
                  Cold ſweats with a ſharp feuer, doe verily betoken death: but with a more

mild & gentle ague, length of the diſeaſe.
               
               
                  [38]
                  In what part of the bodie the ſweat is, there is the diſeaſe.
               
               
                  [39]
                  And alſo in what part of the bodie there is heate, or colde, there the diſeaſe is ſetled.
               
               
                  [40]
                  And when alterations do happen in the whole bodie ſo that the bodie bee cooled, and heated againe by turns, or one colour ariſe after an other, they ſignifie continuance of the diſeaſe.
               
               
                  [41]
                  Much ſweating▪ cauſed thorough ſleep, doth ſignifie that the body is ſed with

ſtore of meate: but if this happē to one feeding ſparingly, we muſt know that there is neede of euacuation.
               
               
                  [42]
                  VVhen there is much ſweat, colde, or hot, alwaie iſſuing forth, the cold doth ſignifie the diſeaſe to bee more grieuous: and the hot ſweat doth note the diſeaſe to be leſſe grieuous.
               
               
                  [43]
                  Feuers continuall which afflict euerie third daie more vehemently and doe not ceaſe, are the more dā
                     gerous: but by what manner ſoeuer they ſhall ceaſe, and pauſe, they ſignifie that ther is no preſent danger.
               
               
                  (44)
                  Swellings and paines

about the ioints are cauſed to them which are afflicted with long agues.
               
               
                  [45]
                  Thoſe which haue ſwellings and paines of the ioints after agues, do feede ouer liberally.
               
               
                  [46]
                  If a colde ſhiuering fit, the feuer being without intermiſſion, doe aſſaile the ſicke man beeing alreadie weake, it is a deadly ſigne.
               
               
                  [47]
                  Excrements auoided in feuers not intermittent, by vomit or ſpitting, if they be of a leaden colour, blodie, cholericke, or ſtinking, are all euill: but if they come forth conueniently, and eaſilie, they are good.

Alſo, the ſame conſideration is to bee had of thoſe things auoided by the bellie, and vrins. But if anie thing be auoided by thoſe places, which dooth not helpe, it is euill.
               
               
                  [48]
                  In continuall feuers, if the outward parts are cold, the inward do burne, and the patient be thirſtie, it is a deadly ſigne.
               
               
                  [49]
                  In continuall feuers, if the lippe, eye, browes, or noſe, bee peruerted or turned awrie, if the ſickeman do not ſee, nor hear, which-ſo-euer of theſe ſhall happen the bodie being weak, death is neare at hand.
               
               
                  
                  [50]
                  If there happeneth in a continual feuer, difficulty and hardnes of breathing, with delirium, and doting, the ſignes are deadly.
               
               
                  [51]
                  Apoſtumes in feuers which are not diſſolued in the firſt Cryſis, or iudgements, they ſignifie length of the diſeaſe.
               
               
                  [52]
                  It is not abſurde to weep and ſhedde teares in feuers and other diſeaſes, voluntarilie: but to weepe againſt the will is verie abſurde, & inconuenient.
               
               
                  [53]
                  They haue fierce & vehemēt feuers, which haue a tough & clammy moiſture

about their teeth in thoſe feuers.
               
               
                  [54]
                  Thoſe which haue drie coughs prouoking little, are not wont to bee verie thirſtie, in burning feuers.
               
               
                  [55]
                  All feuers proceeding from the tumors in inguine and other adenoſus parts, are euil, except thoſe feuers which are called Ephemerae, and laſt but one daie.
               
               
                  [56]
                  Sweate comming▪ vpon one ſicke of an ague, the ague not ceaſing, is euill: for the diſeaſe is prolonged, and it ſignifieth that there is much moyſture.
               
               
                  
                  [57]
                  If a feuer happen to the crampe, Spaſmus, or Tetanus: then it diſſolueth the crampe.
               
               
                  [58]
                  If a colde ſhaking fit do com vpon him which hath a burning feuer, then a deliuerance from the diſeaſe is procured by it.
               
               
                  [59]
                  An exquiſit, and perfect Tertian feuer, commeth to his Cryſis or ſtate in ſeauen circuits or fits, at the vtmoſt.
               
               
                  [60]
                  Thoſe that waxe deafe and thicke of hearing thorough feuers▪ are deliuered from that diſeaſe by fluxe of bloud at the noſe, or by

flux of the wombe.
               
               
                  [61]
                  Vnleſſe the feuer ſhall leaue the patiēt in the odde daies, it is accuſtomed to returne againe.
               
               
                  [62]
                  Thoſe which haue the yellow Iaundis happening vnto them vpon agues, before the ſeauenth day, haue an euill ſigne.
               
               
                  [63]
                  Thoſe feuers which haue their colde ſhaking fits returning at a certaine daie, are diſſolued the ſame daie.
               
               
                  [64]
                  It is a good thing for them which haue the yellow iaundes comming on them in feuers on the ſeuenth day, ninth, eleuenth,

or fourteenth day: vnleſſe the right hypocondrium bee hard: for then it is not good but euill.
               
               
                  [65]
                  In feuers, a vehement heat about the ſtomach, & a gnawing about the heart, is an euill thing.
               
               
                  [66]
                  Convulſions in ſharpe feuers, and vehement pains about the bowels, are euil.
               
               
                  [67]
                  In feuers, great feares through ſleep, or convulſion, doe prognoſticate euil.
               
               
                  (68)
                  The breath not keeping due courſe is euil: for it doth ſignifie convulſion.
               
               
                  
                  (69)
                  Vrins with a feuer being thicke, clotted, and little in quantity, do profit them which make them, if afterwards thin vrins, and much in quantitie be auoided of them: but thoſe vrins moſt commonly become ſuch in which the Hypoſtaſis or ſediment, ſhal appear ſtraight after they are made, or not long after.
               
               
                  [70]
                  Thoſe which haue their water troubled or vnclean in agues, ſuch as are the waters of Cattell, haue or ſhall haue headache.
               
               
                  [71]
                  Thoſe which ſhall haue their Cryſis or alteration of the diſeaſe the ſeauenth

day, haue a little red Cloude in the vrine the 4. daie, and other things therunto belōging accordingly.
               
               
                  [72]
                  Vrins verie cleare and white are verie euill, eſpecially if they appeare in thoſe which are afflicted with phrenſie.
               
               
                  [73]
                  Thoſe which haue an inflation of the Hypocondria, and a rumbling pain of the loynes ſucceeding, haue their belly moyſtned and looſned, except the windes breake forth downwards, or ſtore of vrine doe iſſue forth: and theſe things happen in feuers.
               
               
                  
                  [74]
                  To thoſe that doubt of apoſtumations to come about the ioints, much vrin thick, and white, doth deliuer from the apoſtum, ſuch as is wont to be auoided in painfull feuers, the fowrth daie: when alſo bloud ſhal iſſue forth of the noſtrels there ſhall be a diſſolution and a deliuerance ſpeedily.
               
               
                  (75)
                  If anie piſſe bloud or filthy matter, it ſignifieth an exulceration of the kidnies or bladder.
               
               
                  [76]
                  Thoſe which haue ſmall pieces of fleſh, and as it were haires, iſſuing forth togither with thick vrine, do auoid thoſe excrements

from the kidneies.
               
               
                  (77)
                  Thoſe which auoid with thicke vrin certain branny contents, haue their bladder infected with an vlcer, or ſcabbedneſſe.
               
               
                  (78)
                  It is ſignified to them which piſs bloud vpon the ſodaine, that there is ſome veine of the kidnies broken.
               
               
                  (79)
                  They in whoſe vrin ther appeareth an Hypoſtaſis or ſediment full of ſand, haue their bladder or kidneies diſeaſed with the ſtone; but eſpecially the bladder, becauſe it hath a verie ſpatious hollowneſſe or cauity.
               
               
                  
                  [80]
                  If anie one piſſe bloud or clotts of bloud & make his water by drops, hauing paine in that part of the belly (which is betweene the nauell and the ſecret parts) named hypogaſtrion, or at the ſeame-line of the skinnne of the coddes, called perinaeum, and at the place called pecten▪
                      (where the haire about the priuie members groweth) then the places about the bladder are diſeaſed.
               
               
                  [81]
                  If any one piſſe bloud or filthy matter, or little ſcales, and there bee alſo a ſtinking or ſtrong ſmell, it doth betoken an exulceration of the bladder.
               
               
                  
                  [82]
                  Thoſe which haue an apoſtume bred in the vrinarie paſſage, or conduit of the water, they are deliuered from it, the ſame being brought to ſuppuration & broken.

                  A Conuulſion by taking Elleborus is deadlie.
               
               
                  (2)
                  A Convulſion after a wound, is pernicious and deadly.

                  [4]
                  After an immoderat purgation (which the Greeks call Hypercatharſis) a convulſion or hicket is euill.

                  If any drunken man do ſuddainly waxe dumbe, he ſhall die with convulſion, vnleſſe hee be taken with a feuer, or preſently recouer his ſpeech at that hower in which the ſurfet is diſſolued.
               
               
                  [6]
                  Thoſe which are taken with the cramp or diſtention, named Tetanus, do die

within fowre daies: but if they ſhall ouerpaſſe them, they recouer their health.
               
               
                  (7)
                  The falling ſickneſſe which is before ripeneſſe of age, is remoued awaie: but that which hapneth after the 25. yeer of the age doth for the moſt part accompany vs vnto death.
               
               
                  [8]
                  Thoſe which are ſick of a pluriſie, vnleſſe they bee purged vpwardes, within fowrteene daies ſhall haue the diſeaſe turned into an impoſtume.

                  A conſumption moſt eſpecially hapneth in thoſe ages which are fro the 18▪

                  [10]
                  Thoſe which haue the euill cauſe of the ſquinancie conuerted into the lungs, do drie within ſeuen daies: but if they eſcape them, they are affected with corrupt and filthy matter (called empiema)▪

                  If the ſpittle which they auoid by coughing that are affected with a conſumption, doe ſtinke ſtrongly being caſt vpon the coles, and the haires of the head doe fall off, it is a pernicious & deadly ſigne.
               
               
                  (12)
                  If a flux of the belly happen to them which haue

their haire falling awaie by a conſumption, death is neare at hand.
               
               
                  (13)
                  Thoſe which cough forth frothy bloud, do

                  (14)
                  If a fluxe of the bellie come vpō him which is in a conſumption it is a pernicious ſigne.
               
               
                  (15)
                  Thoſe which are infected with an impoſtume by a pluriſie, if they be purged from the corrupt matter within fortie daies after the breaking of the apoſtume, are cured, or otherwiſe they paſſe into a conſumption.
               
               
                  
                  (16)
                  Hot water too often vſed bringeth theſe diſcommodities; tenderneſſe of the fleſh, diſtemperature of the ſinewes, heauineſſe & drowſineſſe of the minde, fluxes of blod, ſwounings, & faintings of life to which death is incident.
               
               
                  (17)
                  But the vſe of colde water bringeth convulſions, the crampes called Tetani, blackneſs & cold ſhakings vſuall in ſome feuers.
               
               
                  (18)
                  Colde water is hurtfull to the bones, teeth, ſinews, braine, and marrow of the backe: but that which is hot is good and profitable.
               
               
                  
                  [19]
                  Wee muſt heate thoſe things which are ouercold; except thoſe which powre forth bloud, or are inclined to powre forth bloud, in ſhort time▪
                  
               
               
                  [20]
                  Colde water biteth and nippeth vlcers, hardneth the skinne, hindreth the ſoreneſſe from maturation of the corrupt matter, cauſeth, blackneſſe, bringeth forth colde ſhiuering fittes of▪ agues, convulſions, crampes, and diſtention of the ſinewes.
               
               
                  [21]
                  Notwithſtanding, ther is ſome time, when in the crampe without an vlcer in a well fleſht young man

in the middeſt of ſommer, plentifull powring out of colde water doth call back the heate, and ſo the heate doth diſſolue the crampe.
               
               
                  (22)
                  Hot water yeeldeth vnto vs a great token of ſecurity, and ſafety in that vlcer and ſore in which it cauſeth ripe and wel digeſted matter: it ſoftneth and mollifieth the skinne, it maketh it thinne, it dooth appeaſe paine, it mitigateth and aſſwageth colde ſhakings, convulſions, & the cramps (named Tetani) it diſſolueth heauineſſe and paine of the head, it profiteth broken bones very much, eſpecially if they bee bare without fleſh; and principally

in the head: alſo it profiteth thoſe things which are mortified & exulcerated through colde. Laſtly, it is profitable to eating vlcers in the ſūdamēt, priuie members, wombe, bladder: to all thoſe, hot water is a friend and comforter, but cold water is an enemie and a deſtroyer.
               
               
                  [23]
                  We muſt vſe cold water to thoſe ſores from whence bloud dooth iſſue, or is about to iſſue, and not to be applyed in the ſame place by which it iſſueth but to thoſe places from whence it floweth. And if anie inflammation or burning of the parts, do incline to a red and bloudie colour with

freſh cleare bloud, apply colde things, or cold water vnto them: but if the inflā
                     mations bee inueterate and old, it maketh them black. Alſo it helpeth the fiery inflammation, named Eryſipelas, if it be not vlcerated. For, being vlcerated it hurteth.
               
               
                  (24)
                  Things that are verie colde, as ſnowe, and yee, are hurtfull to the breaſt, they procure coughs, they cauſe ruptures of the veins, and alſo rhumes.
               
               
                  (25)
                  Cold water powred forth aboundantly, doth eaſe and diminiſh the tumours and paines of the ioints, which are without vlceration, & alſo gowty ſwellings and

pains and convulſions for the moſt part, & diſſolueth dolour and pain: for a ſmal benumming hath the force of diſſoluing and putting awaie of paine.
               
               
                  (26)
                  Water that is quickely made hot, & quickly cold, is moſt light.
               
               
                  (27)
                  It is good for them which haue great deſire to drinke in the night to fall a ſleepe, being verie thirſtie.
               
               
                  (28)
                  A fumigation, or perfume, of odoriferous ſpyces dooth bring forth the terms. It would alſo be profitable for manie other things if it did not breede heauineſſe and pain of the head.

                  Thou ſhalt purge a woman with childe if it bee needful, the fowrth month after conception, and ſo forwards vntill the beginning of the ſeuenth month: but thoſe that come neere the ſeauenth, month not ſo much: but the foetus▪
                      being yonger or elder thou ſhalt abſtaine.
               
               
                  [30]
                  A woman with child, a veine being opened, aborteth & is deliuered before due time: and ſo much the rather, if the foetus bee of any bigneſſe.
               
               
                  [31]
                  It is pernicious & deadlie if a woman great with childe bee taken with anie ſharp diſeaſe.

                  A woman is cured from vomiting bloud, her mōthly tearms iſſuing forth.
               
               
                  [33]
                  A flux of bloud at the noſe is good and healthfull to a womā, her flowers failing contrarie to the due courſe of nature.
               
               
                  [34]
                  If the wombe bee verie laxatiue and looſe to a woman with childe, there is danger of aborcement.
               
               
                  [35]
                  Sneeſing hapning to a woman grieued with ſuffocation of the wombe, or hauing a painfull and difficult deliuerance is good.

                  The monthly courſes being

diſcoloured, neyther comming forth alwaies in the ſame maner, and time, do declare that a purgation is neceſſarie for the woman.
               
               
                  [37]
                  If the paps be ſuddenlie extenuated and become lanke to a woman with childe, aborcement dooth follow.
               
               
                  [38]
                  If one of the dugs be extenuated and become lank to a woman cōceiued with child with twins, ſhe bringeth forth one of them before due time: And if the right dug becom ſlēder ſhe bringeth forth the male childe before due time, but if the left dug becom lank ſhe maketh aborcement of the female.
               
               
                  
                  [39]
                  If any woman neither with child nor hauing bin deliuered of childe, haue milke in her breaſts, her monthly courſes haue failed her.
               
               
                  [40]

                  If milke flowe plentifully out of the dugs of a woman bearing a child in her wombe, it ſignifieth that the childe is weake: but if the paps be hard and ſtiffe, they declare a ſtronger cō

                  The ſtrangurie or dropping out of the vrin dooth happen by the inflammation of the ſtraight gut, & likewiſe of the wombe or mother, to the reins that be exulcerated: alſo if the liuer be inflamed, the hicket or yexing doth happen in the meane while.

                  If the monthly purgations doe keepe their courſe to a woman with child, it is impoſſible that the foetus ſhould be in health.

                  The ſame conſideration and reaſon is likewiſe to be reſpected in men: for either

                  It is not good to giue milke to them which are troubled with headach, or with agues, nor to thoſe which are troubled with the diſeaſe called ſtatus Hypochondriacus, nor to thoſe

which are troubled with thirſt. It is alſo nought for them which auoide cholericke excrements downewards, or to thoſe which haue ſharpe feuers, or haue had ſome copious euacuation of bloud. But it is good for thoſe which are in a conſumption, ſo they be not troubled with any vehement feuer. It is alſo good for long lingring and milde agues, ſo that none of the ſignes before ſpoken be preſent. It is good alſo for them which are brought lowe without any apparant reaſon or occaſion.

                  Colde ſhakings and ſhiuerings for the moſt part doe begin to women from the loines, and through the back do come to the head: But to men they doe rather beginne in the backe part then in the forepart; as from the hinder parte of the thighes and from the elbowes: the raritie and

            A BRIEFE diſcourſe vpon the nature & ſubſtance of the Ey.
            
            
               Definition of the eye. AN eye is a member, of ſubſtance, roūd, whol and hard as a ball (which may aptly be reſembled to a bright baſon, full of cleer reſplendent water) fixed in the wel or ſpring of the hed to miniſter light to the liuing body by influence of the viſible ſpirit, ſent from the Cell of phantaſie,

or cōmon wits by a ſinew, that is called Nervus Opticus, with helpe of a greater light miniſtred without. Right well may the place wherin nature hath placed the eye bee tearmed the fountaine or ſpring of the eye, in reſpect of the abundance of waterie humidities, and teares which are often ſeene to iſſue & flow thereat; which happeneth vpon diuers occaſions: as The cauſe of teares.ſomtime of inward ſorrow and heauineſſe of the diſſtreſſed heart, ſometimes of ioy and gladneſſe immoderate: yea, and otherwhiles it proceedeth of the onlie ſuperfluitie & abundance of humours ingendred of vnnaturall and diſtemperate

coldneſſe. And this may ſuffice to declare briefly what an eye is. It The partes of the eye.reſteth now, that we ſhew of what parts it doth conſiſt. Touching which matter a certain learned writer called Iohannicius in his introductiō affirmeth, that the eie hath ſeuen tunicles, or coates, fowre colours, and three humours. The firſt of the ſaid tunicles, or coats, he calleth Retina: the ſecond Secondina, the third Sclerotica, the fourth Aranea, the fift Vuea, the ſixt Cornea, the ſeauenth and Fowre colors of the eye.laſt, Subiunctiua. Of the colours, he ſaith, the firſt is blacke, the ſecond Subpallidus, that is whitiſh, the thirde Niueus, the fowrth

               3. Humors of the eye. 
               Glaucus. Now of the humors, according to his mind, one is called, vitreus humor. i. a glaſſie humour: the ſecond is called albugineus. i. reſembling the color of the white of an egge: the third is called Cryſtallinus, that reſembleth the cleareneſſe of Cryſtall.
            And this as I haue expreſſed is the iudgement & opinion The Authors opinion.of Iohannicius. Neuertheleſſe, I my ſelfe vpon knowledge attayned by cutting dead bodies, am moued to diſſent from him both in coats, and alſo in colours. Therfore you ſhal vnderſtand my minde alſo in this matter. I find in the ſtudious diſſection of the eye, the tunicle called ſalua
               
               trix, which ſaueth and keepeth the humors ordeined naturally, to be in the member; of which duetie it hath that name. Secōdly, the tunicle or coat, called diſcolorata; ſo named becauſe that while it remains in the eye, in it ſelf it hath properly no colour, but is varied and diuerſly affected according to the diuerſities of colours which appeare in the eye. For, when the cryſtalline humour is neere the tunicle of the eies, then loe they ſeem of no colour. But whē it is deep within them, it giueth a ſhew of 3. colours: wherfore I may well conclude, that the eie of it ſelfe it diſcoloured, and of no colour properlie.
            
               
Yet this by obſeruation is found to be verie true: they which haue the humours very lowe and deepe ſet in Black eiesthe bodies of their eyes (by reaſon whereof they ſeeme to be of black colour) haue their ſight beſt for a time: but when they approache vnto thirtie yeeres and vpward, it beginneth to faile and appaire. And ſuch as haue the humours placed in the middle or meane region of the eye, commonly are indued with good ſight Gray eyes.both young and olde: the colour of their eyes is menable black, which is gray. Howbeit, it is ſeene that this ſort of eies is more ſubiect vnto Opthalmies, Pannicles, with diuers other euell

affects then thoſe that be of other colours.
            Moreouer, I ſay, thoſe that haue the humors more outwardly, vnderneath the tunicles, as their eyes appeare vnto ſight more various and diuers coloured, inclining much vnto whiteneſſe, Whitiſh eyes.ſo their viſible facultie is not very good, neyther in youth nor in age. The reaſon is, becauſe in ſuch maner of eyes aboundeth humours and teares more then in others. For when the viſible ſpirits deſcend down, by the hollow optique ſinewes, & find about the tunicles of the eye abundance and plentie of vicious humours, they be Note this reaſon.the ſooner ſcattered & diſſolued

And they that haue the ſayde graie eyes may ſeeme to haue their ſight more durable, for that the cryſtalline humour being reſident in the midſt, maketh the viſible ſpirits to reſt and ſtaie there; which by the glaſen humour and the ſaide tunicle are ſo preſerued and kept, that they may not readily be diſperſed. But in them which haue the humours depreſſed, and kept Black eyes

then in other, becauſe the cryſtalline humour is deep within: and therfore the viſible ſpirit comming from the Optique nerue at hand, findeth the larger ſpace, & poſſeſſeth plentifullie all the cauitie and hollowneſs of the eies, before it paſſeth out from the glaſen humor and the vppermore tunicles. But as I ſaid, it dureth not in manie folke vntill age. For oftentimes in ſuch manner of eyes are ingendred * Catharactes, yet more in ſom ſorts of them, then in other. As concerning the humor I willinglie ſubſcribe vnto the opinion of Iohannicius and make therein no variance.
            
               
               
                  Hereafter followeth the manner of helping the catharact by the needle, out of the ſame author.
               
                  Definition of a Catharact. A Catharact is nothing elſe but a water corrupt or congealed like a curde, engendred of humours diſtempered in the eye, betwixt the tunicles, and 
                     •
                  et before the ſight of Diuiſion of Catharacts.the eye, and the cryſtalline humour. And of the manner of Catharactes be noted ſeuen kindes, whereof fowre be curable. And the firſt of the curable ſort is

light, euen like vnto white The firſt curable kinde.chaulke or alablaſter, well poliſhed. This hapneth oftentimes with a ſtroake in the eye, with a ſticke or a ſtone, or anie other outward The ſecōd kinde.violence. The ſecond kind curable is ſomewhat white, and much reſembleth the skie colour. It proceedeth from the ſtomacke; and is commonlie cauſed of euill meats, wherof a groſſe fumoſitie reſolueth and aſcendeth vp vnto the braine, from thence falling downe againe into the eyes. The third kinde The third kinde.curable is alſo whitiſh, but enclining vnto the colour of aſhes; and is commonlie ingendred of paine in the head, as megrime and ſuch

others. Alſo it is cauſed ſometime thorough great ſorrow and heauineſſe prouoking great lamentation & weeping. And ſomtime of much colde, immoderat watching, and ſuch like. The 4. kinde.The fourth kinde of Catharactes curable is of citrine colour, and is commonly engendred of exceſſe in meate and drinke, euill digeſtion, great labour, and ſometime of melancholick humours. And theſe which wee haue remembred bee the fowre kindes of Catharactes curable, but not vntill they Tokens of 
                        •
                     peneſſe.be ripe & confirmed. And the time of their ripeneſſe, is when the patient cannot ſee at all anie longer, except

it bee the brightneſſe of the ſunne by daie, and the light of the moone, or a candle by night. Now for the cure to proceed orderly The curefirſt you muſt purge the braine, with theſe pills ordained for that purpoſe, called Pillulae Hieruſolymitanae. And giuing the patient this on the one daie, on the next following about nine of the clocke, while he is yet faſting, cauſe him to ſit ouerthwart a ſtoole in ryding faſhion, and ſit thou alſo on the ſame ſtoole face to face, & make the patient holde his whole eye cloſe with his hand, and in that ſtate charge him ſo to ſit ſtedfaſtly not ſtarting in any

wiſe.
               This done, firſt with thy owne hand lifting vp the ouer eye lidde, with thy other hand put in thy needle made for that purpoſe, on the ſide further from the noſe; and finely thrilling the tunicle called Saluatrix, writhe alwaies thy finger to and fro, till thou touch with the point of thy needle the corrupt▪water, which indeede is the Catharacts and then begin to remooue downewarde from aboue, with the point of thy needle, the ſayde water which lyeth before the fight: and driuing it downe to the neathermoſt partes, keepe it there ſtill with the point of the

needle, as long ſpace as may ſerue thee to ſay fowre or fiue times the Lords Prayer.
               Then remooue eaſilie thy needle there from, and if it happen to riſe vp againe, bring it eftſoones to the cordes of the eye to the earwarde.
               But heere you muſt bevvare that after the needle hath touched the Catharact, in anie wiſe you vvryth no more your fingers to and fro till it bee out.
               And after vvhen it is all out, cauſe him to ſhut his eye, and anone make a playſter of cotten or flaxen hardes, vvith the vvhite of an Egge, and

laie it vpon the ſore eye, & cauſe him to lie downe in his bed, vntill the 9. day, giuing him in ſtraight charge that during all that time he ſtirre not his eye: & thriſe in the daie, and thriſe in the night, remoue his plaſters, and make him to lie in a darke place; namely, Dyet.all that time. For his dyet within the ſayd nine daies, let him eate reare egs with bread: and if he be young, & ſtrong of body, let him drinke water, and keepe ſtraight dyet during the time. But being in age, permit him the vſe of wine, but well watered. Now The ſubtance of he needle.for the ſubſtance of the needle wherewith you worke, let it be of gold, ſiluer, or at

leaſt ſpaniſh latten, and in no wiſe of yron or ſteele: for yron and ſteele is hard, and with the hardneſſe it diſſolueth the ſubſtance which it toucheth. Or elſe for this cauſe, if the Catharact be hard, it might peraduenture breake in the drawing downe thereof at the point: for vron & ſteele be free and brittie, and the breaking therof remaining therein, might be cauſe of conſumption of the ſame through the aboundance of teares, and greatneſſe of paine.
               Furthermore, I giue you to vnderſtand, that the firſt kinde of Catharacts curable, The firſt kinde of Catharacts.are eaſie and ſoone holpen: but yet they that bee

cured thereof recouer not their ſight perfectlie, for as much as the humours in the eye bee vnperfect, diſgregate and diſſolued, by the bruiſe and ſtroake, which at the firſt cauſed the Catharact.
               
                  The 2. kinde. The ſecond kinde of Catharacts curable, if they bee well cured vvith a cunning workeman, in this feate, the ſight returneth again to his former goodneſſe, becauſe of the pureneſſe of the humors which bee not diſſolued, and alſo for the aboundance of viſible ſpirits reſerued in the eye: for theſe cauſes, I ſay, they bee better then other.
               
                  The 3. kinde. The third kinde of Catharacts

curable after they bee holpen, in manner aboue ſayde, and the ſight reſtored, it endureth not long time in that eſtate, vnleſſe it bee holpen with medicines, as with our Electuarie, which is called Dia Olibanorum Hieruſolimitanum, and by wholſom regiment of diet, wherein he muſt refrain from goats fleſh, Eeles, & ſuch other
                     •
                   but eſpeciallie thoſe that might engender rawe humours: for certainly I haue proued by experience, the ſame to bee verie euill and noyſome in this wiſe; for diuerſe haue come vnto me with Catharactes not fully confirmed, to vvhome I haue giuen rawe onyons,

by eating whereof in ſhort ſpace they haue become ripe and readie to the needle. Whereupon I gather that rawe Onyons be noyſom vnto the ſight, and inducers of Catharacts. Furthermore, let not the patient in the winter ſeaſon (if it may be otherwiſe) drink any hot wines, in the which bee put ſage and rue. Let him forbeare (as much as may be) the companie of women, forbid him the vſe of all common bathes and ſtewes. But if he will bathe him, let it be with a veſſell ordained with the decoction of Camomill, and other ſweete ſmelling hearbes: but in any wiſe let him keepe his head without the

veſſell that the fume come not into his eyen, for that were noyſome. The Electuarie The vertue of Olibanum.of Dia Olibanum is alſo good to auoide teares, and to dry them vp, as likewiſe it is right profitable for all manner paine of the megrime which is cauſed of fleagme. The fourth kind The 4. kinde.of Catharactes curable is, thoſe that bee of colour citrine more harder then the other, and of forme round: wherefore, it may not be laid right downe in the eie, for it will not abide there, becauſe of the ſaid roundneſſe and hardneſſe of it: therefore it muſt be laide in the corner of the eie to the eare ward, & there be kept with the needle a great

while as is aforeſaid. And thus to conclude. I do you to vnderſtand, there needeth not anie abſtinence from meats which be clean and healthſome, after the cure is perfectly atchieued; ſaue only in the third kind: which thing to be true experience hath taught mee. Neuertheleſſe, it behoueth oftentimes to vſe comfortatiues, & nutritiues for the viſible ſpirits in the eye afterwarde.
            
            
               Of the three kindes of Catharacts 
                  The firſt kind of catharacts vncurable.
                  vncurable.
               
               THe firſt kinde of Catharactes

vncurable, is that which the Phyſicians of Salerne in Italie doe call Guttam ſerenam, and theſe be the ſignes whereby yee may knowe it: when the pupil of the ey. i. the place of the middeſt of the eye, hath the depth of the viſible part, blacke and cleare as though it had no ſpotte, and the eyes are alwayes moouing their lids, trembling, as though it were quickeſiluer.
               Verilie, this kinde of Catharact is ingendred & cauſed of a corruption in the mothers wombe: and therfore they that haue theſe kinds of Catharactes, bee blinde euen at their natiuity; of which ſort I haue ſeen

many, and haue aſſaied by many waies and medicines to cure them: but the ſucceſſe was not worthy my labour, neither yet haue I heard that any other haue ſped better in dealing with that ſort. Neuertheleſſe, in proceſſe of time, I perceiued that of this manner of Catharact, ther were diuerſities of kinds. For ſom of thoſe perſons which had them might ſee the brightneſſe of the ſunne, & went by the way with open eies, as though they had perfectly ſeene: yea moreouer ſom of them might ſee the ſtature of a man, or a beaſt or anie other thing, and ſome enioyed this little portion of ſight vnto their

liues end, whereas in otherſome it doth vaniſh awaie, and they become ſtarke blinde. Therefore aſſure your ſelues, they that haue ſuch maner of Catharacts, be deplorat and without al poſſibilitie of cure by mans hand. For why? the nerue optique is deplorate and mortified, ſo that there is no manner of helpe in power of hand, or medicine for them: and this aforeſaide kinde is called Gutta ſerena, becauſe it is engendred of a corruption, comming downe from the braine, like a droppe of water, which one droppe corrupteth and diſſolueth all the humour naturall in the eye: in ſo much that

from thence forwards the concaue & hollow nerues be oppilat and ouerlaid, in that the viſible ſpirits may no more paſſe downe by them into the eye.
               
                  The 2. kinde. The ſecond kinde of Catharact vncurable, is that which doth appeare in the eye, of greene colour like water ſtanding in watrie places, not much mooued with running. This ſort is yet worſe then al the other, and ſpringeth of the immoderate and exceſſiue coldeneſſe of the brayne with great beating and diſeaſes of the head, with vnmeaſurable faſting & ſuch like.
               
                  The 3. kinde. The third and laſt kind of cureleſſe catharacts, bee

thoſe in which the circles may not bee ſeene within the tunicles of the eye; but the eye appeareth all ouer blacke▪ or all ouer white: and who ſo buſieth himſelfe to cure anie of theſe three kinds of Catharacts, he abuſeth his time and labour, more worthie to bee reproued for his ignorāce, then any wayes commended for his fruitleſſe diligence.
            
            
               
                  Here followeth the cure of Ophthalmia and other diſeaſes of the eies.
               THis Ophthalmia is an inflāmatiō of the whol eye, hapning by ſom great diffluxion from the brain,

and in the tunicle of the eie which is called coniunctiua: this infirmitie is ſomtimes cured by dropping into the A good medicin.eye womans milke, with the white of an egge, and eſpecially if it ſhall happen from ſome outwarde cauſe, or from bloud. If it chance to happen by ſome blowe, or through colde, then the yolke of an egge boyled hard and mixed with oyle of roſes and a little ſaffron muſt be applyed, If it ſhall happen through duſt or ſmoak, waſh the eie Bloudletting.with colde water: if from repletion, or fulneſſe, open the head veine, which is a preſent remedie: if the humors be groſſe and thicke, adminiſter an euaporation

of the decoction of lentiles with water, alſo waſh the eye with ſponges intincted in a decoction of foenugraeck. In this diſeaſe it is verie good to vſe abſtinēce from meate and drinke, the dyet muſt incline to colde and moyſture. Wine, egs, and all ſweete things are hurtfull.
            
            
               An excellent Collyrium, which doth mitigate, re
                  preſſe and beat backe heat, & inflammation.
               
               
                  Collyrium TAke the muſcelage of pſyllium, of gum dragant, of quinces, being prepared in roſe water, of either 3. drams, of womans

milk giuing ſucke to a girle fiue drams, of the white of an egge well beaten, two drams: mixe them and inſtill thereof into the eye.
               
                  Emplaſter. Or elſe vſe this emplaſter againſt an hot fluxe of the eye.
               Take of the iuyce of the hearbe vermicularis, of virgapaſtoris, of plantaine, of nightſhade, of endiue, of purſlan, & ſuch like▪ with the flowre of barley and oyle of roſes make an emplaſter; which muſt bee applied to the temples of the forehead: or dippe linnen clothes in the iuyces and applie them to the forehead.
               The face may be waſhed with running water, roſewater

mixed with a little vinegar: ſo that will alter the biting humor, flowing to the eye.
               If the eye happen to bee hurt, or wounded with a thorne, needle, or knife, we muſt preſently make repercuſſion.
               
                  A water againſt in inflammamation of the eye. Take bole armonick, ſanguis draconis, tutia prepared gum arabick, & dragant, of either a dram, make a powder & mix therwith 6. ounces of roſewater in a glaſſe viol, then let it ſtand in hot water the ſpace of an howr, thē afterwards add 1. ounce of the wine of pomgranats▪ & ſo let it ſtand for 1. whol daie, & then ſtraine it, & of that ſtraining put a little into the eie Morn, & Euen;

and for to lay ouer, you ſhall frame an emplaſter with the iuices of houſlike & niteſhade, of either two Emplaſter.ounces: or in their place take roſewater, bole armonicke, myrrh, gumdragant and araback; of either one ounce: make it into pouder and ſo apply it in the form of an emplaſter to the eyes, for it doth both beat back, and cure.
               For ſpots or webs in the eie beeing remaining after the cure, we muſt preſently vſe this remedie. Take young Pyes out of the neſt a little before they are readie to flie, let them bee cleane puld and cut in peeces, and then diſtilled: of which water put into the

eyes an houre before ſupper, and in the morning it remoueth away al redneſs, ſpots, and cataracts: this remedie is confirmed by experience: ſome doe affirme the ſame virtue to be in Conſolidaregalis.
               
               
                  Weeping eyes. Sometimes the eyes do weepe and water againſt the will, which is cauſed by the debilitie of the braine, beeing weake and ouermoiſt: for which cauſe thou ſhalt do no more but drop into the eye for xv. dayes togither, two drops of the water of Tapſus barbatus, called in engliſh Hagtaper.
               
               Againe, Rue being dryed and beaten into powder, and mixed with hunny and vineger, and boyled

and after ſtrained through a linnen cloth and the eyes therewith anointed will reſtraine the vveeping and teares thereof: the patient muſt auoide all things that do euaporat & fly vp to the braine: if the cauſe proceed from choler or from bloud, it ſhall bee diuerted by bloud-letting: if the cauſe proceede from fleame, it is good to purge with pilles of aureae, and imperiales; take heede of gargariſms, Bathes.maſticatories, and apophlegmatiſmes. Bathes of warme vvater are verie conuenient ſo they bee vſed in the morning faſting: for that draweth the matter to the vtter parts.
               If the matter be ſharpe,

applie a repercuſſiue about the forehead framed with the white of an egge. and bolearmonicke, and ſo applyed vpon a peece of linnen cloth.
               If the cauſe haue proceeded from fulneſſe or much drinking of wine, let him vſe a ſpare dyet, and open the head veine, and let him purge with the pils of the 5. kindes of myrobalans: his dyet muſt bee drie; for hee muſt auoid all broaths and liquid things: ſower grapes and vnripe, beeing burnt in an earthen pot to powder, and ſearced verie finelie and put into the eyes, doe remoue awaie the teares and redneſſe of them.
               
                  
A ſingular remedie for the eyes, is to take true frankincenſe, and melted at the fire, and ſo ſeauen times extinguiſhed in red roſewater, and thereof inſtill into the eye that weepeth.
               An excellent medicin for the eyes that weep, for a pearle, and dimneſſe, is this.
               Take halfe an ounce of tutia, one dram of red corrall, burne them in a veſſell of earth, then adde thereunto halfe a dram of ſine A powder for the eiespearle, and then beat them ſmall into verie fine powder in a ſtone mortar, and then ſearce it finely thorough ſilke, and then put therof into the eye, this is a great ſecret.
            
            
               
               How to cure debilitie & weakneſſe of the ſight.
               
               HIs dyet muſt be good as in ophthalmia, let Weake ſight.his head bee well combd with an iuorie combe, let him behold things that are greene, and beholde himſelfe in a ſteel glaſſe: the vſe of triphera dooth comfort very much, becauſe it hindreth euaporations by reaſon of the myrobalans. Let him take after his meals Diacitoniton, the confection of Coriander prepared, Diapliris, and ſugar of roſes, in an hot cauſe. Venerie & luſt is hurtfull, and all things that are vaporous.

Rapes either rawe, or boiled are very good. Wine vnleſſe it be in ſmall quantitie, is verie hurtfull. There muſt not be made any ſtrōg euacuation, leaſt the ſpirits be diſſolued.
               An excellent vvater An excellent water to preſerue the ſight.which dooth preſerue the ſight, and good againſt all manner of ſpots, is in this manner. Take Celendine, rue, endiue, betonie, roſes, Silermontaine, mallows, maiden haire, of euery one three handfuls, let them be infuſed in pure white wine for the ſpace of 24. howers and then diſtilled.
               A Collyrium for the eies which hath bin approued, is to take tutia prepared, 2. ſcruples, aloes hepaticke

one ſcruple, cloues halfe a ſcruple, white vitriol ſixe graines, and make a fine powder.
               
                  A Collyrium for the eyes. Then take roſewater & fenell water of eyther two ounces, let it warme vpon the hot imbers, then mixe the powder therewith, and after a while ſtraine it and put therof into the ey in the mouing.
               
                  Electuarie to comfort the ſight. An Electuarie which dooth cleare and comfort the ſight. Take the flowers of eye-bright and of betony, of either one ounce, fenelſeed three drams, cubebs, maces, cinamon, and cloues, of either one dram, long peper halfe a dram let all be made into fine powder: then take of the iuice

of Rue clarified one ounce and a halfe, clarified hony one pint, boyle the iuyce with the honie to a perfection, and then adding three drams of zedoarie to the former powder make an Electuarie.
            
            
               A powder to comfort the ſight.
               
               TAke betonie, veruin, eyebright, celendine, hyſop, penny rioll, ſage, all theſe being dried in the ſunne, of euerie one halfe an ounce, horehound, fenelſeed, wild time, Coriander prepared▪ the ſeed▪ of maiotā of euerie a dram, ginger, ſaffron, cloues, cubebs, nutmegges, cinamon, long

                  An houſhold receipt for the remouing of any ſpot or pin and webbe of the eye.
               TAke the iuice of houſlick the quantitie that will goe▪into an egge ſhell, then put therein 3. graines of pure white vitrioll, let them boile togither on the hot aſhes, and then ſcum

the top thereof awaie, and drop thereof into the eye morning and euening, and cloſe vp the eye with a boulſter of linen.
               For all inflammations & bloud ſhotten eies, take the iuyce of a limon, and drop thereof into the eyes at the entrance into the bed, and cloſe vp the eies as is aforeſaide: and remember that for all inflammations proceeding of an hot cauſe bloudletting, to be the preſent remedie.
            
            FINIS.
         
      
      
         
            
            THE LIFE of Hypocrates.
            
               
                  HYpocrates by the teſtimony of Galen, was the ſon of one Heraclides: but others affirm him to be the ſonne of Aſclepius, borne and brought vp in the Iſle Cos. His maſter and inſtructor was the great Pythagoras. Hee was by his nature inclined to goodneſſe: for he hated, loathed

and abhorred all pomp & worldly pleaſures, and the vſe of venerie. Hee conſtrained all his ſcholers by an oath to vſe ſilence and ſecrecie, modeſty, affabiliti, and humilitie as wel in manners as apparell. He reſtored the ſcience of phyſicke; beeing loſt for the ſpace almoſt of fiue hundred yeeres, euen from the time of Eſculapius. Hee was in body and ſtature very little; but fayre, and exceeding well fauoured. He had a good and ſtrong head: he went ſlowely and ſoftly: he was verie penſiue and of few words: he

was no great eater nor glutton: hee liued nintie fiue yeeres, and vſed often this ſentence; Hee that wil liue in liberty, let him not deſire that which he cannot obtaine: and hee that woulde haue that which hee deſireth, let him deſire nothing but that which hee may obtaine. In like manner, He that would liue in peace in this mortall life, let him conforme himſelfe to him who is inuited to a feaſt, who giueth thankes for all that is ſet before him, and grudgeth not at any thing which is omitted. He liued

about the times of Eliachim, of Malachi, of Pereno & Socrates.
