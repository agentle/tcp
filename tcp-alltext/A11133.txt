            To Reſpectiue Readers.
            GAllants expect no idle newes,
            For carrying tales I ſcorne to vſe,
            Imploy their tongues that way who will,
            Mens heads with ſtrange reports to fill,
            Of what is done in forraigne lands
            I cleer from thoſe things waſh my hands,
            I meddle not like light-brain'd men,
            VVith this and that, and where & when,
            And how and which and what and why,
            And thus, and ſo, I ſcorne it I,
            I haue a melancholy Scull
            Is almoſt fractur'd tis ſo full
            To eaſe the ſame theſe lines I write,
            Tobacco boy a pipe, ſome light.
         
         
            
            Introduction.
            
               VVHen Phebus Chariot (flaming liuing fire)
               Was drawne with winged horſes to the Weſt,
               And obſcure darkneſſe clad in blacke attire,
               Had ſummon'd euery ſleeping eye to reſt,
               The cloudie curtaines of the heauens were ſpread,
               And glorious day from faire Aurora fled.
            
            
               The windes were all lockt vp and nothing ſpoke,
               The dribling waters murmur was not heard,
               No fire was ſeene, yet all the ayre ſeem'd ſmoke:
               The ſtarry lamps were from their ſhining barr'd
               Fower-footed tramplers, all had drowſie heads;
               Buſh-breeders wrapt vp in their feather-beds.
            
            
               An vniuerſall ſlumber ceas'd on all,
               To bury cares in sleepes forgetfulneſſe,
               
                  
While dreames and viſions did in queſtion call,
               Charging the minde with much vnquietneſſe,
               And did preſent an obiect to my ſight,
               That made next day to wonder at laſt night.
            
            
               I ſawe, (or ſeem'd to ſee a well ſhap'd man,
               His body formed comely as I thought;
               Yet not deſcribe him perfectly I can,
               Becauſe his outſide was ſo ouer-wrought,
               With Taylors art, new faſhion'd from the ſtall,
               What I be held was but mans making all.
            
            
               His face being masked with his hat pull'd downe,
               And in french doublet without gowne or cloake,
               His hoſe the largeſt euer came to towne,
               And from his noſtrels came much ſtinking ſmoake;
               
                  
Garters would make two enſignes for a neede,
               And ſhoo-ties that for circle did exceede.
            
            
               His head hung downe, his armes were held a croſſe,
               And in his hat a cole-blacke feather ſtucke,
               His melancholy argued ſome great loſſe,
               He ſtood ſo like the picture of ill lucke:
               I longed much his humour for to finde
               Vntill at length he thus reueal'd his minde.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            THE
MELANCHOLY
KNIGHT.
            
               LIke diſcontented Tymon in his Cell,
               My braines with melancholy humers ſwell,
               I croſſe mine armes at croſſes that ariſe,
               And ſcoffe blinde Fortune, with hat ore mine eyes:
               I bid the world take notice I abhorre it,
               Hauing great melancholy reaſon for it.
               Ile put my caſe (and if the world doe pleaſe)
               To fowre mens cenſures, and they ſhall be theſe;
               For my part Ile haue Ryot ioin'd with Pride,
               
               Take Couetouſneſſe and Fraude, on th'other ſide,
               And all I haue ſhall thereupon be laid,
               Which is not much, if all my debts were paid:
               
                  
That when theſe honeſt men giue vp awarde,
               They will confeſſe the world doth vſe me hard,
               When my agreeuances doe once appeare,
               Which I in briefe will only point at here.
               The cauſe from whence my melancholly growes,
               To the iudious will it ſelfe diſcloſe:
               Oh wicked age, of wretched daies and times,
               Wherein I write theſe melancholy rimes!
               Vngratefull world, falſe and vnconſtant found
               To thoſe braue mindes, to whom thou moſt art bound:
               I haue red ouer (while youths glaſſe did run)
               Sir Lancelot of the Lake, the Knight of th'Sun,
               Sir Triamour, Sir Beuis, and ſir Guy,
               
               Fowre ſonnes of Amon, hors'd ſo gallantly,
               And all the old worlds worthy men at armes,
               That did reuenge faire Ladies wrongs and harmes,
               The Monſter ſlayers, and the Gyant killers,
               With all the reſt of Mars his braue well-willers,
               Which to rehearſe I neuer ſhall be able,
               The Worthis Arthur had at his round Table;
               
                  
And how in Chronicles thoſe dead ones liue,
               By breath that Fame doth from the Trumpet giue.
               But what an age is this my fellow Knights?
               (I meane all you whom melancholy bites)
               As it doth me, the Iouiall ſort I leaue
               That haue their hundreds yeerely to receiue;
               For they and I, I know ſhall neuer meete
               In Golding lane, nor yet in Siluer ſtreete;
               My melancholy walkes finde ſpacious roome
               With penſiue pace, about Duke Humfreys Toome,
               Where many thoughts aboue the Steeple climbe,
               That humbly walke away their dinner time:
               Yet in deſpite of Fortunes turning wheele,
               In ſcorne of gold I weare it at my heele;
               Euen in contempt of wealth my ſpurres are guilt,
               And ſiluer's common in my Rapiers hilt;
               I hate the Idoll miſers dote vpon,
               Being as bigge in heart as Preſter Iohn,
               
               Diſdaining Pezants, Ruſticks, Boores and Clownes,
               My minde is full of Caſtles, Towers, and Townes,
               
                  
Woods, wilderneſſes, ſtately fields and groues,
               With cattell, moſt innumerable droue,
               Corne, precious odours, ſpice, heart cheering wine
               The Ocean full of ſhips me thinkes is mine,
               And who can haue a richer mind then this?
               Only poſſeſſion is a thing I miſſe,
               And want of that ſame powerfull point in Lawe,
               Makes me remember late a peece I ſawe,
               An artificiall feaſt which rare did looke:
               But yet becauſe the Painter plaid the Cooke,
               To make the gazer to his prayſe a debter,
               The eye was pleas'd but ſtomacke nere the better.
               Euen ſo my minde, which is an empire to-me,
               Yeelds hautie ſwelling thoughts, and they vndoe me,
               Leauing me only an old ſong to ſing
               The ballet of the Begger and the King;
               But that I can abide no muſicke now,
               My melancholy will no mirth alow,
               Therefore take warning reſolute ſet downe,
               To all the fidling fellowes in the towne,
               
                  
That they approch not neere my tauerne roome,
               On paine of ſtabs to be their fatall doome.
               If but their ſight my preſence doe annoy,
               Ile finiſh all their daies from man to boy,
               The like for th'Talor for his ſcrawling bill,
               I take his Items moſt diſtaſtfull ill:
               If he preſn me to aske my worſhip chinke,
               With poniard point his doublet Ile bepinke.
               The Mercers man that plyes me ſo of late,
               Before I croſſe his booke Ile croſſe his pate.
               A Gallants minde beyond all reaſon frets,
               To pay for worne ſutes, out of faſhion debts,
               To come for money due in eightie nine,
               Will make a man that's out of caſhe repine:
               Yet there's Hungarians that on tearmes doe ſtand,
               As if one ſtill ſhould haue his purſe in's hand.
               But letall ſuch take notice what Iſay;
               My humor's to receiue, not now to pay,
               It is an eaſie caſe to vnderſtand;
               Tenants will ſhrinke, when Land-lords ſell their land:
               
                  
For 'tis not now as in the dayes of old,
               When men were willing to depart with gold,
               Giue longer time, friend Creditor to debter,
               Angels grow proud becauſe th'are twelue pence better
               And very ſcarce withall I will be ſworne,
               When to keepe Knight-hood company they ſcorne,
               For I that know their abſence may be bold,
               To cleere my hand from this corrupting gold,
               Looke to it Lawyers vnto you they flie,
               And you muſt anſwere for them more then I,
               You can transfor me their caſe from good to euill,
               Turning an angell oft into a Diuell;
               But let the Deuill haue a golden clawe,
               You will defend him any ſute in lawe.
               Phyſicians, likewiſe, muſt be offered too,
               Or elſe both pill and potion will not doe:
               He that into their purging hands doth fall,
               Muſt bring a ſacrifice Angelicall,
               But both may ſterue ſor what they get of me,
               If with my Creditors I once agree.
               
                  
Ile leaue friend Lawyer to his Littleton,
               
               For little good with me there will be done,
               And ſo for Doctor-purge an's gliſter pipe,
               His dyet ſhould be worſe then ſowce and tripe,
               If I his Pat
                     •
                  ents Phyſicke might perſwade,
               We would vndoe him quite and ſpoyle his trade.
               Take the rare hearbe that growes on India ground,
               (In Tauerne and in Alehouſe ſo renown'd)
               Smoke noſes with the ſame from one to tother,
               As though your faces were all ſea-cole ſmother,
               Make fogges and miſtes aſcend in hot degrees,
               Snuffe ſome into your noſtrils till you neeſe,
               And ſpit and ſpawle vntill your throats be choking,
               But aboue all things keepe your noſes ſmoking,
               For that's moſt Blacke-amore and Inaian like,
               And fume the brauer in your braine will ſtrike;
               Then rhume it out, and doe no ſpitting ſpare,
               Fo
                     •
                   abſolute Tobacchoniſt you are:
               This is braue phyſicke for braue Caueleers,
               This at both ends, vpward and downe ward cleeres:
               
                  
Twill make one ſober that was drunke before,
               Fill a pipe boye before I write line more;
               So, heer's a health vnto the good eſtates,
               Of all our Poets that haue ſmoking pates:
               The Muſes bleſſe their braines with ſtore of wit,
               I neere knew Vſurer amongſt them yet,
               That puts out hundreds to ingender tennes,
               Their ſtocke conſiſts of paper, inke, and pennes,
               And a ſew bookes, their value prouing ſmall,
               When ſometime rated on a Brokers ſtall.
               But what haue I to doe with what they pawne,
               Or ſell, or giue, or dedicate by fawne;
               Let me ſuruay mine owne houſe well within,
               Where no exceſſe this many a day hath beene;
               I ſcorne both ſiluer cups and guilded plate,
               Common with baſeſt trades-men growne of late.
               Tinkers and Coblers and ſuch vulgar aſſes,
               I loue to drinke Gentleman-like in glaſſes,
               The rare french faſhion is preferr'd thereby
               Which graceth out good wine vnto the eye.
               
                  
Or be it our owne natiue Engliſh beere,
               A glaſſe preſents it to you comely cleere
               If it be thicke, or thin in watry plight,
               The Brewers fault will that way come to light:
               Beſides, you know by fire great loſſes growes,
               Which to preuent (as all my neighbours knowes)
               I ſeldome times haue any chimney ſmoke,
               Except great cold extreamely doe prouoke;
               Yet often then, for feare of doing harme,
               I lie a bed till noone, and keepe me warme.
               Likewiſe, I doe not waſtfull ſpend my ſtore,
               In drawing idle Beggers to my doore:
               For if I ſhould, the Country would come downe,
               And bring a charge of poore vpon the Towne;
               No, there is none ſhall frame by me excuſes
               And taxe or charge me with theſe great abuſes:
               And as for gluttons feaſting at my Table,
               Let them that are more willing or more able.
               For I proteſt, who ſurfets on my cheere,
               Within the compaſſe of theſe ſeauen yeere,
               
                  
Ile pay for's phyſicke on my knightly word,
               If he'le be ſworne he tooke it at my boord:
               I keepe a table hanging in my hall,
               The Poetry is my inuention all;
               And though I ſay it, (wanting others praiſe)
               The Morals ſit moſt rarely for our daies,
               A frugall houſe, it doth inſtruct to keepe
               Matter in this age to be weighed deepe,
               Although the lines are written but with inke,
               A man may call them golden Rules I thinke,
               Becauſe this doth aduiſe to ſaue his purſe,
               The empty plague whereof ther's nothing worſe.
            
            
               Ile be no miſer of them to my friends
               Becauſe, good counſell, no wiſe man offends,
               Thus they begin, th'are plaine, but to good ends.
            
            Into my ſpacious Hall who enters here,
            Must not expect to meete with belly-cheere,
            No Diues dinings, nor yet Nabals feaſts
            Our dyet doth diſtinguiſh men from beaſts:
            
               
In ſteede of fat beefe breake-faſts when we riſe,
            Apipe of good Tobacco will ſuffice,
            Which both diſchargeth all the rhume we haue,
            And doth the charge of other drinking ſaue.
            Bal't, roſte, ſod, at noone is vulgar feeding,
            But daintie ſallets they are moſt exceeding.
            Strong drinke make ſtrong diſſentions this is ſure,
            Your ſmallest beere, ſmall quarrels doth procure;
            At night, light ſuppers if you light vpon,
            Digeſtion eaſie will be quickly gone:
            An egge new laid is phyſicall rare roaſted,
            And ſo is cheeſe of the welch faſhion toaſted;
            Beefe, Mutton, Porke, Veale, Lambe, (groſe dyets folly)
            Are breeders of expence and melancholly,
            Small birds, ſmall fiſh, ſmall reaſons and ſmall beere,
            May ſaue a knight, a hundred pound a yeere.
            Let ſuch as will ſhun prodigall expence,
            Learne to obſerue good wholſome rules from hence;
            Thoſe that are of another humour, ſo
            Each man his owne purſe credit beſt doth know;
            
               
So I doe mine, for as before I ſaid,
            The Golden-age and Siluer is decay'd:
            Oh now comes on a melancholy ſit,
            To write of Golde and not poſſeſſe a whit;
            Once more Tobacco boy, Ile ſmother griefe,
            I tarry for it ſirra, quicke be briefe.
            What ſayes the knaue that keepes the ſmoaking ſhop?
            Will he haue money ere I drinke a drop?
            Doth he deny to truſt me one pipe more?
            Tell him, Ile nere pay penny off my ſcore
            Vnleſſe he ſend me preſently his beſt.
            And furthermore, thus much I doe proteſt,
            Choller doth ſtirre my furie vp ſo grim,
            If he deny to ſmoke me, Ile ſmoke him:
            Shall I be held for ſuch a younger brother,
            As not be truſted for a little ſmother?
            Is ready-money ſo vpon the ſpurre
            That debts like Lawyers may not vſe demurre,
            Why then the auncient ſpeech moſt true doth chance
            Heers yours, ther's mine, no longer pipe then daunce:
            
               
Well, leaue that knaue becauſe he deales ſo baſe,
            Fetch me Tobacco at another place,
            Bid him ſend good, and ſet it on the ſcore,
            He ſhall haue all my cuſtome for great ſtore:
            If theſe ſame fooliſh knaues had any wit,
            My cuſtome would afford much vſe of it:
            For to all Guls that come why they might vowe,
            A Knight had of this very rowle but now,
            Who daily ſends and likes it paſſing well:
            And thus my name their bad for good might ſell,
            And vtterance thereby would not be ſmall,
            So I deſerue the beſt, and truſt withall:
            But fooles there are cannot occaſion ſee,
            A very Cobler ſhall as welcome be
            That payes his readie money at the ſtub,
            As I that come a truſt to worſhips dub,
            This makes me melancholy as a Cat,
            And in mine eyes doth cauſe me pull my hat,
            To thinke how all men carefully prouide
            To ioine with money on the ſtronger ſide.
            
               
Let it be foole; or aſſe, or dolt, or gull,
            More ſheepiſh then the Sheepe that weares the wooll,
            No language, but the Countries that did breed him,
            Taught by the parting Nurſe which did ſpoon-feed him,
            Got vp to London with a ſtick in's hand,
            And there ſeauen yeere at ſome ſtall talking ſtand;
            His trauels, Islington, Hacney, or Hyegate.
            
            Yet this ſmoth fellow with his cunning ſly pate,
            Will ſcrape, and ſcratch, and ſpare, and pinch and ſaue,
            Beyond my wealth for all the wit I haue:
            And note the ſpitefull caſe twixt him and I
            Let me on credite any where goe buye,
            And he in's purſe haue ready money plentie,
            Where I haue one Sir they le afford him twenty:
            Yes ſir, and I ſir, welcome ſir, indeed ſir,
            When I ſhall haue tis money that wee need ſir,
            This Gentleman, (then haue a hat he muſt)
            Payes preſent quoyne, intruth we cannot truſt.
            Heere be the fellowes with the nimble hammes,
            And they haue learn'd to liue without their dammes;
            
               
Such as haue skill to ſell a peece of ſtuffe,
            And hauing wealth, why they haue wit enough.
            Admit a man ſhould brauely vndertake,
            To trauell further then ſir Francis Drake,
            
            And with more languages his tongue were cloy'd,
            Then there was vs'd when Babell was deſtroy'd:
            What of all this, when tryall ſhall be found,
            T'would neuer ſerue to take vp twentie pound:
            Let Scholler bring his Hebrew and his Greeke,
            And with the ſame a hundred pound goe ſeeke,
            The Vſurer in Engliſh will reply,
            Sir I muſt haue ſome good ſecuritie:
            Come Traueler from Turkey, Roome, or Spaine,
            
            And take a ſute of truſt in Burchin-lane,
            Let him bring newes to furniſh all th'Exchange,
            And make himſelfe admired at moſt ſtrange:
            Some Citizen muſt paſſe his bond or bill,
            Or elſe the Gallant reſts non-ſuted ſtill.
            Let Souldier come with ſcarre-becarued skinne,
            And talke of Newport battaile he was in:
            
               
Seige of Oſtend, and braue exploits in France,
            
            To golden credite twill him not aduance:
            Who'le take his word for lodging, or for diet?
            He might haue ſtay'd at home and kept him quiet:
            Perhaps will ſome ſay, and haue ſau'd an arme,
            Or Musket ſhot had done his legs no harme;
            And this hath made me neuer venter farre.
            I once was ouer-Sea to ſee the warre,
            Where ſouldiers ſpent both blood and life moſt free
            But I proteſt not one the leſſe for me:
            No, killing men? I euer did abhorre it;
            Yet doe not hold me to be Coward for it:
            For if I were conſtrain'd to doe my beſt,
            My ſword ſhould be as naked as the reſt,
            There's certaine rules which I intend to vſe;
            Firſt Ile not fight vntill I cannot chuſe:
            And all my Creditors, while I doe liue,
            Shall haue good words, though nothing elſe I giue;
            Giue me the lye my patience milde receiues it,
            Knowing I often lye, when none perceiues it.
            
               
And therefore that ſame tearme doth ne're perplexe me;
            But if I vs'd not lying, ſure t'would vexe me:
            Good company doth very much delight me,
            I ne're thinke ſcorne who euer doe inuite me;
            The pooreſt man that keepes the meaneſt houſe,
            I'le taſte his pudding, or his peece of ſouce,
            His houſh oldloafe, his butter and his cheeſe,
            Such curtiſie by pride I will not leeſe,
            If it be offered me, I will not faile
            To take my neighbour Coblers pot of ale.
            With meane good-fellowes I can well agree,
            And leaue rich Kninghts as well as they leaue me:
            Yet ſhall my Lady haue her owne deſire,
            To match their Ladies in their braue attire:
            For ſhee's a Gentlewoman (though I ſay-it)
            That doth deſerue to domineere and ſway it,
            To Lady it, ſhe ſeru'd a Lady taught her,
            Well bred and borne a good rich Graziers daughter;
            One that if once he bid the world good night,
            His death would cure the Melancholy knight;
            
            
               
And make him mightie with exceſſiue wealth,
            But I am ſicke to thinke vpon his health;
            A luſtie man and yet aboue three-ſcore:
            If I ſhould die and goe to heauen before,
            Which I thinke not; but if I ſo were croſt,
            All that eſtate were e'ry peny loſt:
            With him I play the Polititian ſo,
            I haue his loue moſt abſolute I know,
            Rundlets of Sacke, with ſuger-loaues and ſpice,
            I ſend as tokens that may loue intice,
            Which if I did not hope to finde at large,
            He ſhould be hang'd ere I would bear the charge.
            For now adaies I hold he groſſe doth erre,
            That ſpends his money for I thanke you ſir,
            I am beholden to you for this kindneſſe,
            Count me a buſſard if I ſhew ſuch blindneſſe:
            No, I haue one gift proueth not amiſſe
            To take all comes, be whatſoere it is.
            As for example, when I let a leaſe,
            And raiſe my rent vnto the moſt increaſe;
            
               
When th'utmoſt peny I haue brought it to,
            Before I ſeale the ſame, why thus I doe,
            I adde a Capon, Turkie, Gooſe, or ſo,
            At quarter day my Tenants loue to ſhow,
            And no man is ſo ſimple and abſurde,
            That he will looſe his bargaine for a birde:
            Thus doe I fetch my ſubtill hob-nailes in,
            More craftier growne by ods then they haue bin;
            But let them growe as cunning as they may,
            There's trickes to fetch them in and make them pay.
            'Tis not amiſſe to keepe ſuch fello wes vnder,
            That they and riches may be held aſunder:
            For if their wealth come to a little height,
            They thinke the mſelues their Landlords fellowes ſtreight;
            This is a thing that ought not be allow'd,
            But Ile keepe mine for being ouer proud,
            They ſhall not boaſt of pen-worths at my hand,
            In any thing they hold of houſe or land:
            What charge haue they but homely country fare,
            Or what diſcredit if their clothes be bare,
            
               
When I muſt maintaine ſhew of gallant life;
            Eſpecially vpon my Lady wife,
            Who (I proteſt vnto my very friends)
            More in apparell then my rent is, ſpends:
            My tent, poore rent, like to a garment rent,
            As thats paſt wearing that is almoſt ſpent,
            If one fat kinſman or another dye-not,
            And that vnlucky handed Death ſupply-not,
            Ere long the wandring Knight I will goe play,
            And put out venters at returne to pay:
            As, who will vndertake giue three for one,
            When I doe that which hath bin done by none,
            Namely, returne from Salsbury to London
            
            And number iuſt thoſe ſtones (to this hower vndone)
            The Diuels baſtard Merlin placed there,
            Which admirable doe each other beare:
            Or when I croſſe the Ocion into Fraunce,
            
            And bring from thenceking Pippin's warlike launce,
            Mounſieur Malignants armour of gold plate,
            (Which would proue very wholſome to my ſtate)
            
               
And hundred proiects which I keepe obſcure,
            Vntill the practiſe I doe put in vre.
            Another helpe I haue at a dead liſt,
            As I could turne Aſcumiſt for a ſhift,
            Shift ſaid I, that ſame word I will conuert,
            Leaſt ſome conclude it for a ſhifting art:
            Yet for the rime ſake, (cauſe I am in haſte)
            Ile let it paſſe, how euer it diſtaſte,
            And ſuch as make a queſtion, let them trie-it,
            For on my credit there is profit by it,
            But how? note that, not out of braſſe and copper
            To turne that gold in qualitie iuſt propper,
            But turning off againe to the profeſſor,
            That of a wealthy Nouice is poſſeſſor,
            'Tis a deepe Arte to try concluſions by,
            And may be called Craft, or Myſt-er-y:
            
            There is no Science that a man can name,
            Makes all profeſſors rich that vſe the ſame.
            Some man hath gotten much by Alcumie,
            
            And many men haue loſt, Ile not deny:
            
               
And on my credit I dare boldly ſay,
            I know the getting and the looſing way.
            Why then may ſome obiect vnto me ſir:
            What is the cauſe your ſelfe you not preferre?
            Ile ſhew them reaſon for it by and by,
            And thus conceiue it in a Simily.
            An Angler goes to take himſelfe ſome fiſh,
            Hauing baite, line, and hooke vnto his wiſh,
            He patient waiteth with a fixed ſight;
            Yet taketh none becauſe they will not bite:
            Few words will ſerue to ſatisfie the wiſe,
            Picke Engliſh out of this, let that ſuffice.
            
               Tobacco boy, and a cleane pipe withall,
            Sirra a candell, tis in haſte I call,
            I once kept men, (whoſe liueries being worne)
            For ſauing charge, a boy now ſerues my turne:
            Amongſt the reſt I had a beetle-head,
            Of vulgar education Clowniſh bred,
            Whom I call'd to me as alone I ſate,
            And tooke Tobacco, which he gazing at:
            
               
Sirra (quoth I) vnto the ſtaring owle,
            Giue a cleane pipe, and burne this ſame, tis fowle,
            So he ſupply'd my vſe ſ
                  •
               ill with a new,
            And thoſe which I return'd away he threw,
            When none was left, haſt burn'd thoſe pipes I ſaid?
            (Quoth he) ſir I as good a hand haue made,
            With them you bad me burne, our fire is ſmall,
            And ſo to make ſhort worke I broke them all:
            The Clowniſh villaine, thinking I did burne them,
            As out of vſe, I did intend to turne them;
            Quicke, drie Tobacco, fill a pipe compleate,
            And then my pen goes forward in a heate,
            There's newes rare newes, new newes come to my hand,
            The like nere ſince the conqueſt in this land;
            Call'd Trew and Wonderfull the ſtory ſaies,
            A Serpent newly whelped in our daies:
            Nay more, a Dragon is title fitter,
            Becauſe he is a verie poiſon ſpitter:
            Some he hath kill'd, but eate them he refuſes,
            And neere to Horſham, worſe then horſe play vſes▪
            
            
               
For he hath ſlaine (they ſay) I know not who,
            Nay, is beſide a Cony-catcher too,
            Suppos'd to liue by theeuing in the warren;
            Which if he doe t'will make the burrowes barren:
            But if according to the Bookes direction,
            The Carrier tell vs of his ſtrange infection,
            It ſhall be ſeene the Melancholy Knight
            
            Like valiant George will with the dragon fight.
            Let him wrap vp his body in a bundle,
            And with his poiſon vp to London Trundell,
            
            Ile arme my ſelfe directly at all points,
            And on the Dragon venter limbes and ioynts,
            He or ſhe Serpent, I will ſet vpon-her,
            To raiſe my worſhip to degrce of honour,
            I hope it is note qually ſo fierce,
            As that ſame Monſter Chronicles rehearſe,
            Which came out of the Iriſh ſeas a ſhore,
            The like whereof was neuer ſeene before,
            With whom the king Meruidius would go fight,
            Forbidding combate to each other Wight;
            
               
For which braue reſolution which he held,
            He was paſt hope and helpe moſt cruell kill'd;
            If he be ſuch I will vnſay't againe,
            I long not to be deſperately ſlaine,
            And ſet vpon a poyſon-ſpitting thing:
            Hath teeth and clawes, and venome, taile and ſting,
            That were foole-hardy to expoſe my life,
            And make a mourner of my Lady wife:
            And therefore for a time I will forbeare,
            Till of a ſecond part in print I heare;
            Which ſhall no ſooner (I proteſt) come out,
            But Ile take horſe to Horſham for a bout,
            And ſo I leaue this filthy ſcuruie Dragon,
            That neuer yet did ſoyle a Knight to bragge on.
            I chaunc'd of late an ancient booke to view,
            As good as Beuis, and as ſtrange and trew,
            Of Lyons Leopards. Tigers, Beares and Bores,
            And ſuch ill faces as in Foreſts rores:
            Amongſt the reſt was one that had a den,
            Pil'd like a wood-wharfe with the bones of men,
            
               
He had a head moſt fearefull to behold,
            Wherein, two eyes like globes of fire rol'd,
            Teeth terrible to bite through fleſh and bone;
            A forked tongue the like was neuer knowne,
            Clawes paſt compaire to ſcratch downe trees withall
            A ſting in's taile would enter through a wall,
            I doe proteſt, I was almoſt afraid
            To reade the ſtrange diſcription that was made,
            Of this den-diuell, (ſure he was no leſſe)
            As by the ſtory any man would gheſſe:
            Yet by a valiant Knight, this ſame hot ſhot
            Was hew'd as ſmall as fleſh vnto the pot.
            Then in that booke a Dragon I doe finde
            The like is not among the Dragons kinde,
            Th'inchaunted Dragon of the darkeſome ſhade,
            Of ſeauen mettals all compos'd and made:
            And that the world ſhall witneſſe I am red
            (Gainſt melancholy vexings in my head)
            In auncient ſtories courage to prouoke,
            Not ſpending all my time in taking ſmoke,
            
               
Although my worſhip's ſcandal'd now and then
            Amongſt the ruder ſort of vulgar men,
            But that I turne and ouerturne againe
            Old bookes, wherein the worm-holes doe remaine,
            Containing acts of auntient Knights and Squires,
            That fought with Dragons, ſpitting forth wilde fires
            The hiſtory vnto you ſhall appeare,
            Euen by my ſelfe verbatim ſet downe heere:
            
               As thus,
               Sir Eglamour that worthy Knight
               He tooke his ſword and went to fight,
               And as he rode both hill and dale
               Armed vpon his ſhirt of male.
               A Dragon came out of his den
               Had ſlaine, (God knowes how many men:)
               When he eſpied ſir Eglamore,
               
               Oh if you had but heard him rore,
               
                  
And ſeene how all the trees did ſhake,
               The Knight did tremble, horſe did quake;
               The Birds betake them all to peeping,
               It would haue made you fall a weeping:
               But now it is in vaine to feare,
               Being come vnto, fight dogge fight beare.
               To it they goe, and fiercely fight
               A liue-long day from morne till night:
               The Dragon had a plaguy hide,
               And could the ſharpeſt ſteele abide,
               No ſword will enter him with cuts
               Which vext the Knight vnto the guts;
               But as in choller he did burne
               He watch'd the Dragon a good turne,
               And as a yawningh did fall,
               He thruſt his ſword in hilts and all.
               Then like a Coward he to flie
               Vnto his den that was hard by,
               And there he lay all night and roar'd;
               The Knight was ſory for his ſword:
               
                  
But riding thence ſayd, I forſake it,
               
               He that will fetch it let him take it.
               And ſo I hope to the Iuditious wiſe,
               Thus much of this rare ſtory ſhall ſuffice,
               To proue how I in worthy workes am read,
               How ere illitterate cenſures are miſled:
               But as I will not vaunt of my deſerts,
               So will I not in toome mine owne good parts,
               I haue a Muſe hath beene at Helicon,
               
               And braine ſome-time that verſed do th flow vpon
               The world ſhall know though Melancholy bite.
               The diſcontented Money-ſcorning Knight,
               
               I haue interiour excellence that ſhines
               Beyond your earthlings gold and ſiluer mines:
               Once more Tobbacco to perfume my braine,
               Ile ſmoke amongſt you in my Poets vaine.
            
            
               
               Melancholie Conceits.
               
                  RApier lie there, and there my hat and feather,
                  Drawe my ſilke curtaine to obſcure the light,
                  Gooſe-quilland I muſt ioine a while together:
                  Lady forbeare I pray, keepe out of ſight,
                  Call pearle away, let one remoue him hence,
                  Your skreeking Parrot will diſtract my ſence.
               
               
                  Would I were neere the rogue that cryeth blacke,
                  
                  Buy a new Almanacke, doth vexe me to:
                  Forbid the maid ſhee winde not vp the iacke,
                  Take hence my watch it makes too much a doe,
                  Let none come at me deereſt friend or kin,
                  Who ere it be, I am not now within.
               
            
            
               
               To Fortune.
               THou pur-blinde puppet for a Tradſ-mans ſtaule,
               Thou limping Ladie of the Hoſpitall;
               Empreſſe of Epicures and belly-gods,
               With whom I vowe to liue and die at ods;
               Thou mole-ey'd, owle-ey'd, Counteſs for a ſpittle,
               That giues to ſome too much, to mee too little,
               Thou whirly-gigge, and rats-bane of my life,
               Which by thy wheele doſt ſeeme ſome wheel-wrights wife
               Thou make-bate to a diſcontented minde,
               Thou water-bubble, waſtfull puffe of winde,
               Thou flying-feather of a wood-cocks wing,
               Thou Heatheniſh and very Pagan thing,
               Thou Miſers friend, thou worthie Gallants foe,
               Thou ſcuruie Ballat of▪ 
                  I wale in woe,
               
               
                  
Thou that all diſcontentment doſt prouoke,
               Thou worſe to me then this Tobacco ſmoke,
               Thou that ſage, Fury, Enuy doſt importune,
               Ile tickle thee, thou ſcuruy minded Fortune.
            
            
               To Ladie Pecunia.
               A Pin for them that care apoint for me,
               And that's the loue betweene my ſelfe and thee,
               Proud Lady of the gold and ſiluer mine,
               Thou ſcorn'ſt my company, I baniſh thine:
               What ſtampe ſoeuer thou about doſt beare,
               And cauſeſt many for to ſtampe and ſweare;
               Or runneſt current quoine, from man to man,
               I am not currant thou haſt made me wan.
               And therefore ſince thou giueſt me vnreſt,
               In being ſtranger to my purſe and cheſt,
               Not looking on me with thy golden face,
               Nor yeelding me angelicall embrace:
               
                  
Expreſſing loue by pounds moſt kinde and willing,
               But comeſt to me by ſixe-pence, and by ſhilling;
               To be thy Treaſurer I doe abhorre it,
               Ile neither purſe nor cheſt, nor bagge thee for it,
               But vſe thee euen in all diſgrace I may,
               To eate and drinke, and dice thee ſtill away.
            
            
               To Patience.
               LOng haue I waited at thy woefull gate,
               With expectation to augment my ſtate,
               And ſought for her which cannot yet be found,
               The Lady that makes crazie credits ſound;
               She that I thinke will nere be friends with me,
               Becauſe a ſunder we ſo often be:
               But Patience I proteſt thou art to blame,
               And I haue cauſe vpon thee to exclame,
               Thou doſt neglect, deferre, protract, delay,
               And puts me emptie off from day to day;
               
                  
When I expect to haue my wants ſupply'd,
               Sayes, helpeleſſe friends, Patience good ſir prouide:
               Who can take vp an hundred pound, I pray,
               And pawne ſome patience till he come and pay:
               Or trade with Tradeſ-man be for what it will,
               That will take Patience hand vnto his bill.
               No maſters no, all gripe to get their owne,
               And I from Patience am impatient growne.
            
            
               To Fame.
               THou art the Lady that I ſeeke to pleaſe,
               Before Pecunia, Fortune, Patience; theſe
               Are all inferiour in renowned name,
               To this eternall honour-giuer Fame;
               
               Say I had Fortunes gifts in large degree,
               Why fooles haue fortune we doe daily ſee.
               If moneyes Lady would for me prouide
               More quoine and plate, then is in all Cheape-ſide:
               
                  
Let Solons ſaying in this caſe ſuffice,
               There are more wealthy fooles then wealthy wiſe;
               If I take Patience phyſicke for my ſore,
               And wate with her at expectations dore,
               What's the reward will follow? euen this;
               
                  Patience and pouertie in th'end will kiſſe:
               Therefore Ile ſet wit working like a watch,
               Some rare vnknowne inuention to diſpatch
               That all the world could not haue brought about,
               If I had not beene borne to finde it out:
               And when I haue it (being yet vnbegotten,
               I ſhall haue Fame aliue, and dead and rotten.
            
            
               To Time.
               THou Regiſter of old Antiquities,
               Obſeruer of the worlds iniquities,
               Suruaying life from birth till Death in toombe,
               From Adam's making, to the day of doome:
               
                  
That in thy reſtleſſe cunning doſt admit
               Of actions lawfull, or of things vnfit,
               And haſt thy head behind of purpoſe ball'd,
               Becauſe thou neuer wilt be backe recall'd;
               But wear'ſt a locke before I vnderſtand,
               On which I neuer yet could lay my hand.
               I haue expected (thou graue auntient father)
               Thy helping hand, and I proteſt the rather,
               Becauſe they ſay that Time by turnes doth goe,
               And hitherto I haue not found it ſo:
               Therefore for ſome good turne, one of theſe daies
               I challenge thee, or Ile diſprooue thy praiſe,
               And I write of thee according as I find,
               That thorow age thou art both ball'd and blind;
               Finde out a time, good Time for to relieue me,
               For at this time, Time very bad doth grieue mee.
            
            
               
               To all miſerable Miſers.
               YOu careleſſe raking, greedy getting ſlaues,
               That neuer haue enough till in your graues,
               Vntill Death haue you priſners in his hold,
               As you in cheſts locke vp your bagges of golde,
               You that haue that exceſſiue wealth lyes by,
               Would furniſh twentie ſuch poore Knights as I,
               I doe deteſt you all as dunghill ſwaines,
               You dogged Nabals with your curſed gaines,
               That loue baſe lucre ſo entirely well,
               You'leventer ſoules, as Diues did to hell;
               And heere I vowe, promiſe, and firme proteſt
               I ſcorne this hoording money in a cheſt,
               That golden ſin on me ſhall neuer light,
               As cleere as is the childe was borne laſt night;
               From keeping money lying on my hand,
               So much kinde gentle Reader vnderſtand,
               With Bias I doe giue the world this flout,
               All that is mine I beare with mee about.
            
            
               
               The Concluſion.
               THe Fryer that his braines did breake,
               To make a brazen head to ſpeake,
               And ſpent his ſtudy ſeauen yeere,
               Ere that perfection would appeare;
               Then fell a ſleepe when he ſhould watch,
               Truſting his man a fooliſh patch,
               That to it gaue no heed at all,
               But heard the voice and would not call:
               What was the gaine he got at laſt?
               Three words, Time is, Time was, Times past,
               
               And thoſe for this time I haue tooke
               To end my melancholy booke:
               Eſpecially, laſt of the three,
               Which is Tim's paſt: farewell to thee:
               FINIS.
