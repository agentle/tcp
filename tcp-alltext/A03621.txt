Gouerner of the perſon of the Kynges

lief in the lyuyng
God throwghe Chriſt
Ieſus oure only
ſauiour.
            THe Godlye pretence and conſideration
of your warfare of late
into Scotlond Mooſt grocious and
uictorious Prince, and the iuſt occacion

yeuen by youre Ennymyes to uſe
the forſe of youre mooſt mightie
and uertews Armye: the lord hathe ſo
magnyfied withe proſperouſe and uictorious
ſucceſſe: that it ſemythe not
only à uictory mooſt Noble worthy
perpetuall memory. But alſo to be
eſtemyd as à ſinguler fauour and mercyfull
benedictiō, of God yeuen from
heuen: Who accuſtomy the many tymes,
unto ſouche à godlye pretenſyd
purpoſe, to annex and add an externall
ſigne and teſtimonye of his godd
will, that the worold ſhuld not only
acknolege hym to be the God of batell
and ſaye, this thyng is don by the
lord and is wounderfull in our yeys
but alſo remembre that thus the lord
uiſithe to blyſſe ſouche as ferithe his
name, boothe in war and in peace.
And as Euery godly and good man
doothe preace the deuyne mageſtie of
God for his ineſtimable fauour and

grace in this heuenly uictorye, ſo he is
to be callyd upon allwayes here aſter
to folow youre grace withe like ayede
and cōſolacion. that the thyng godly
begon, may take à gracious and bleſſyd
ſucceſſe, thold Amite and frendſhippe
reſtoryd that God by the creacion
of the worold appoyntyd to be
in that one Realme and Ilond deuydyd
frō all the worold by imparkyng
of the ſea by naturall diſcent of parentayge
and blud, one in langayge and
ſpeche, in form and proporcion of perſonayge
one, one in maner and condicion
of lyuyng. and thoccacion of all
diſcord and hatred banyſhyd that the
godd ſcotiſhe Engliſhman may confeſſe
and do the ſame at hom that he
doothe in forene and ſtrange countreis
Calling an Engliſche man all
wayes his contreman and ſtudious to
do hym pleaſure before ony other Nation
of the worold. The Breache of

this deuynd and Naturall frendſhippe
is the uery worke of the deuill by
his wyckid membres that hathe not
tawght Scotland only diſobedience
unto here Naturall and Laufull prince
and ſuperiour powre the Kynges
maieſtie of Englond. But alſo the contempt
of Chriſt and his mooſt holy
word throughe all the worold there
iniquite and malyce is fulfillid and go
des mercy, Sufficiently declaryd for
ſeing they will not repent he reuenchithe
there iniuſtice withe his mooſt
dredfull Ire not only extenuating thereforſe
and dyminiſhing there ſtrenghe,
but alſo infatuatythe and turnythe
into folyſhnis there mooſt prudent
and circumſpect counſelles. As
it aperid in this batell where as god
uſid youre grace as amenys to youre
immortall renowne to optayne à glorious
and Celeſtiall uictorye agaynſt
his Ennymies and youres that were

not only mache and Equall in forſe
withe youre Armey. But alſo treble
or at the leſt doble as ſtrangers report
in Numbre at the fyrſt onſet. Agracious
and good begynning at the fyrſt
brount of youre graces godly uocation
unto ſo highe honor, not only to
defend the Kynges maieſties mooſt
noble perſon and the Realme but alſo
to better and perfet the crowne if god
will in reconſiling the unnaturall and
ungodly hatred. Betwen too membres
of one body whiche of right and
office ſhuld be as the right hand and
the leffte in peace and Amite to reſiſt
and withſtand the forſe of all ſtrange
and foren aſſultes and uiolence. And
as this uictory and triumphe is to be
reyoyſid at, ſo thend why god gaue it
is mooſt diligently to be conſyderyd
who yeuithe the upper hand in the
worold to godly princes becauſe his
afflictyd churche ſhuld haue ſome place

to reſt it ſelfe in, and the Kyngdom
of god to be amplified in trewthe and
uerite, theffect therof muſt be folowyd
that as well the miniſterye of the
churche be enrychid withe the word
of god, as the ciuile Kyngdom withe
woroldly honor. As I am aſſuryd youre
mooſt noble grace right well knowithe.
Notwithſtonding becauſe the
right of euery iuſt and Laufull here is
halfe loſte and more when his title
and cleame is unknowyn I haue wroten
this litle booke conteyning what
Chriſt is, and what his office is that euery
godly man may put to, his healping
hand to reſtore hym agayne unto
his Kyngdom and dedicatyd the ſame
unto youre Noble grace unto
whom god hathe not onlye committyd
the defenſe of apolityke and ciuile
Realme but alſo the defenſe of his
dere ſonnes right Ieſus Chriſt in the
churche who hathe ſuſteynid open

and manifeſt wrong this manye yeres
as it apperithe by his Euidens and
wrytinges the goſpel ſealyd withe his
precious blud. And whereas I cannot
make his cauſe and right as playne
as it meritithe, nor as it is decent for
hym that would offre and prefer ony
mater to ſo prudent and mightye à
prince: my godd will and diligence is
acceptyd of god in Chriſte I dout not
thowghe it be uery litle that I can do
and truſt likewyce that for the merites
of this ſimple and manifeſt uerite
your grace will pardon my bold entrepryce
and accept this pore worke
in god and gracious part and then it
ſhall appere youre mooſt noble puyſſance
to be coniunyd withe like clemercye
and mercye, the whiche uertewe
of all other cauſithe man mooſt
to reſemble the almightie god that made
not only all thinges for his mercyes
ſake but likewyce withe mercye ouer

himſelfe and his rigorous iuſtice
alſo that the defaultes of mortall
man might fynd ſolace in Ieſus Chriſt
his only ſon̄e who preſerue the Kyng
his Hignis youre mooſt noble grace
withe all the councell and the hole
Realme to the glorye of god Amen.

of god equall with the father in all thīgis
as Iohn ſaythe, Vidimus gloriam

ſo dooth ſainct Iohn proue hym in all

his writinges to be the uery trew and
euerlaſting god and not as Ebion and
Cerinthus ſayde that he was but uery
man only, he was made mortall man
as Iohan ſayth. Et ſermo ille caro factus

This ſcripture dooth not only teache

was not rent nor torn nor kyllyd. But
it obeyd the will of the father. It gaue
place unto the diſpleaſure and Ire of
god that the body of Chriſt might dye
being all wayes equall with his father
he could if he had executyd his deuine
poure delyueryd this body from
the tyranny of the lewes theſe wordes
of Ireneus dooth wounderfully declare

whom it apperteynyd to teache the
people whiche was the chefiſt part of

As all the bookes of Moſes and the
Prophetes teach ad Chriſt commaundid
Peter, Ioan. 20. Paule all the biſhopes
and priſtes of his tyme, Act. 20. of
Chriſtes authorithe and preaching.

Moſes and Stephin, Acto. 7. Deut. 18.
ſayth thus Prophetam ſuſcitabit uobis

not harken unto his uoyce. Shalbe as

they repentyd and beliuyd the goſpel,
Matth. 3. Mar. 10. leaffte nothyng untawght.
But as a good doctor manifeſtyd
unto his audiens all thynges neceſſarie
for the healthe of man as the

not only himſelfe. But ſent his Apoſteles

an diſciples to manifeſt unto te worold
that the acceptable tyme of grace
was com and the ſacrifice for ſynne
born into the worold, Matt. 10. Io. 10.
and after his reſurrextion. he gaue thē

whatt hey ſhuld preache: Ite in uniuerſum
mundum & praedicate, quae

whiche doctrine luk thus expoundithe,
poenitentiam acremiſſionem peccatorum

meo, initio facto ab Hieroſolymis, Lu
ce ultim. In his name, to ſay in the knolege
and faythe of his merites they
ſhuld preche repentaynce and remiſſion
of ſynne unto all the worold. As
they dyd mooſt ſyncerely and playnly
without all gloſſes or addicions of
there awne inuencion and were as
teſtimonies of the truithe and not the
auctors therof Act 1. 1. Ioan. 1. So doothe

Paule theache withe grauite and
manifeſt wordes what is to be iudgyd
of hym ſelfe and all other miniſters.
Deus erat in Chriſto inquit, mundum
reconcilians ſibi, non imputans ei precata

reconciliemini deo. Allwayes in
there doctrine they tawght the thyng
that Chriſt fyrſt tawght and godes holy
ſprit inſpyrid them Gale. 1. 2. Cor. 3.
holy Apoſteles neuer toke upon them
to be Chriſtis uicar in the erthe nor to
be his leaue tenent. But ſayd ſic nos

cap. Imitatores mei eſtote ſicut & ego

churche as thowghe Chriſt were abſent
althoughe his mooſt glorious body
was departyd corporally into the
heauens aboue. But as Chriſt preſent
that all wayes gouernyd his churche
withe his ſprit of truithe as he promiſid
Matt. ult. Ecce ego uobiſcum ſum
uſ
                  
                     
                  
                  que
                ad cōſummationem ſaeculi in the
abſence of his body, he hathe commendyd
the protection and gouernaunce
of his churche unto the holy goſt
the ſame god and one god with the father
and his diuinae nature. Whoes
diuinae puyſſanc and poure ouer machithe
the forſe of the deuyll ſo that
hel it ſelfe can not take one of Chriſtes
flock out of godes protection Ioan. 10.
and this defenſe dury the not for aday
nor here but ſhal demoure for euer
till this churche be glorifieyd at the reſurrexion
of the fleſhe Ioan. 15. it was
no litle payne that Chriſte ſuffryd in
wayſhing away the ſinnes of this

churche. Therefore he will not committ
the defenſe therof unto man: it is
noleſſe glorie to defend. And kepe the
thing wonne by forſe then it is by for
ſe to optayne the uictorye. Adam, Abel,
Abraham Moſes nor Aron cold,
not wynne this churche out of the deuilles
tyranny. No more can they defend
it delyuerid. For althowghe by
imputation of Chriſtes iuſtice theſe
men and all other ffaythfulles be delyueryd
from the tyranny of the deuyll
and condemnation of the law, yet had
and hath the deuyll his uery frendes
Dwelling within the nature of man
corrupt as long as he lyuithe. The cō
               cupiſcence
and rebellion of mannes
nature who, ſeasſythe nor day nor
night to be tray man agayne to the deuill
except with the motion of trew
penitence this cōcupiſcens be kept under
in fere and faythe which, too uertewes
be ſo infirme in mā that be he neuer

ſo perfet yet fallith he from god
ſomtyme as Abrahā, Iſaac, Iacob, Moſes
and Aron, Eſa. 43. Num. 19. therefore
he kepithe the defence and gouernaunce
of the churche only and ſoly
hym ſelfe in whom the deuill hathe
not à yot of right thowghe the Apoſtellis
where inſtructyd in all truithe
and lefft the ſame wroten unto his
churche yet were they miniſtres ſeruantes
teſtimonies and prechers of
this uerite and not Chriſtes Vicars in
erthe and leaue tenent to kepe the Kayes
of heuē hell and purgatory but only
appoyntid to approue the thing to
be godd that godes lawes commaundid▪
And that to be yle, that the word
of god condemnyd. Seing that Chriſt
doothe gouern his church allwayes
by his holy ſprit and byndith all the
miniſters therof unto the ſole word of
god. What abhomination is this that
ony biſhope of Rome Hieruſalem, antioche

or elſe where ſhuld accleme to
be Chriſtis uicar in therthe and take upon
hym to mak ony lawes in the
church of God to bynd the conſciens
of man beſyd the word of God and in
placyng of there ſuperſticion and Idolatry 
                  〈◊〉
                word of God out of his
place by what law by whom or where
hathe ony this title yeuen unto hym
to be Godes uicar, and leaue tenent upon
therthe. Moſes and Aron the beſt
Princ that euer was and moſt godly
gouerner of the people, Aron that fide
le high pryſt and preacher of Godes
word neuer uſurpyd this title to be as
à ſecond Chriſt and maſter ouer mennes
conſciens: if godly Moſes and his
brother Aron neuer acclemyd this title
in therthe doutles it is affoule and deteſtable
arrogancy that this ungodly
biſhopes of Rome attribut unto them
ſelfes to be the hedes of Chriſtis
church the more to be lamentyd he

that conſiderith there liefe and confer
it with the ſcripture will iudg by the
authorite therof, that they were not
for this many yers worthy to be accōptyd
ony membre of godis church
But the membres of the deuyll and
the ffirſt begoten of Antichriſt. Thus
is trew theſe of Rome is not only à tyranny
and peſtilence of body ad ſaule.
But the neſt of all abhomination god
yeue him grace ad all his ſucceſſors, to
leaue there abhominaciō and to cō un
to the light of gods worde. This beſt is
prechyd unto the people to be Aman
that cannot er his auctorite to be à bone
God, and his lawes and to be the
Prince upō the erth of all Princes but
God will iudge him as he is à Murtherer
of booth body and Saule, and poniſhe
the Princes of the worold that
upp hold his abhominacion Moſes
and Aron by the teſtimony of the ſcriptur
neuer tawght but that they receauid

of God and at the laſt booth they
offendyd. Nume. 20. in ſo mouch that
God gaue ſentens agaynſt them that
none of them booth ſhuld enter into
the land of promes for there Arrogan
cij and pride the text ſayth, becauſe ye
were unfaythfull unto me: this falce
belyue was of no dout they had in the
pore of God for the miracle was don
as God ſayd. But that they attributyd
to mouch unto there awne poure and
ſayd: Audite rebelles, Num de petra
iſta nos educemus uobis aquas? For
the changyng of the therde perſon in
this ſentens in to the fyrſt. The Ire of
God pronouncid ſentence of death agaynſt
theſe too uery godly miniſtres
of his word. The ſinnyd becauſe they
ſayd not hyr ye rebellyās cannot Ieho

the father Mat. 3. 17. Ioan. 5. tawght his
diſciples the truith by the only law.
Wroten by Moſes and the prophetes
and not by unwrytyne uerites. And in
all contrauerſis and dout full queſtions,
he auſweryd his contrarijs by the
word of god, in that wonderfull temptation
of the deuill Matt. 4. by collation
of the places of ſcripture he killyd
the deuill with his awne ſwerde: falſly,
and in a wrong ſentence aleging the
word of god by the word of god godly
applyed. When his diſciples were
reprehendid by the Phariſes as breakers
of the ſabboth Matt. 12. He excuſyd
there fact by the law. Non legiſtis
quid fecerit Dauid, & qui cū eo erant,
ſo lik wyce Matt. 15. 19. in all contrauerſys
he made the law iudge betwen
his Ennymis and him. When he was
deſyrid to teach ayong man the way
to heauē and to cū to eū laſting lief he
ſayd in lege quid ſcriptum eſt, quomo

do legis? Matt. 22. lik wice the Saduces
that denied the reſurrexion of the

Anſweryd, habent Moſen & prophetas
audientillos, the ſcripture teachith
what heauen hell, and what man is,
and what Chriſt is therfore Chriſt
ſend dith us theter Io. 5. ſcrutamini inquit
ſcripturas. Agayne being requirid
in à ciuile mater concerning tribute
and obedience unto the princes
of the worold Matt. 22. he ſayd. Reddite
quae ſunt Caeſaris Caeſari, & quae
ſunt dei deo. Yeue unto themperour
that that is deu unto themperour and

unto god that that is deu unto god.
And under the Nam of themperour
he undreſtondith, all ſuperior
poures apoyntid ouer the peple by
god. And would to yeue dew honor
unto them booth as Paule teachite
Rom. 13. 1. Pet. 2. this law teachith man
ſufficiently as well what he is boūd to
do unto god as unto the princes of the
worold nothing can be deſyrid neceſſari
for man but in this law it is preſcribid.
Of wbat degre uocation or calling
ſo euer he be his dewty is ſhewid
unto hym in the ſcripture. And in this
it differith from mannes lawes becauſe
it is abſolute perfeit and neuer to be
Chaungid. Nothing addid unto it
nor taken from it. And the churche
of Chriſt the more it was and is
burdenyd withe mannis lawes the farther
it is from the trew and ſyncere uerite
of godes word. The more man
preſumith and takith authorite to interpretat

the ſcripture after his awne
brayne and ſubtill wytt, and not as the
uerite of text requirith the more he diſhonorith
the ſcripture and blaſphemith
god thauctor therof. It is the office
of â good man to teach the churche
as Chriſt tawght, to reuoke all Errours
and ſouch as Er unto the fold of
Chriſte only by the word of Chriſt.
For the water at the foyntaynce hed
is more halſom and pure then when it
is caryd abrode in roten pypes or ſtyn
king diches. I had rather folow the
ſhadow of Chriſt then the body of all
generall conſelles or doctors ſith the
death of Chriſte. The deuille neuer
ſlept but allways by his miniſtres attemptyd
to deſtroy the uerite of Chriſtes
relligion and cleane to put out the
ligth of truithe. Which was perfet in
Chriſtes tyme and in the tyme of the
Apoſtelles. Nonne ſith that tyme ſo
pure. Saynct hieromein uita malchi

ſayth that his tyme was darkenys in
the reſpect of the Apoſtelles tyme.
            The antiquite of the worold doth darken
the uerite of godes word. As Varro
ſayth truith uetuſtatem multa deprauare.
Multa etiam tollere. Et tercium
ſeculum (inquit) non uidet eum
hominem quem uidit primum. The
truith of godes uerite the more it is uſidd,
practyſid and taught aſter the
wiſdom of man the more is the glory
and perfection therof darkenyd it is
the contrary in all Humane artes as
Cicero ſayth in humanis, nihil ſimul

god muſt therfore be bound to none

the goſpel and unto the miniſtery therof
as Eſa ſayth cap. 8. Obſigna legem

Paule would noman to yeue fayth to

But neuer authorite to interpretat

Bernerd, and other. thowghe
they ſtayed them ſelfes in the knolege
of Chriſt and Erryd not in ony Principall
article of the faythe yet, they did
inordinatly and more then Inowghe
extolle the doctrine and tradicion of

euery doctors tyme was ſubiect

Paule the churche of Chriſt principalto

of all ueryte Menyng that Doctors of
the chnrche had there imperfectiō and

Baſilius and many other reteynid the

the lieffe and rule off monkes and
preferryd that kynd of lief before the

notwe looſt but our labour. this
mouche it hindrth it declarithe hym
that praythe to be aninfidele. To
pray unto that god or goddes that is
not able to healpe him nor hyre his
prayer and no better thē he that prayd
unto the imayge of iubiter in creta
that had nether yares nor yees. It declarithe
hym to cōtemne boothe god
and his worde who aſſurithe euery
man in euery time and in euery diſtreſſe
not only to hyre hym but alſo to yeue
ayede. Mat. 11. ſo now this worſhiper
of ſaynctes departithe from the
knowen and all mighty god to an unknowen
god, and preferrith the doctrine
of man and the deuill before the
ſcripture of truithe and the lyuīg god.
I hope this deteſtable errour is cum to
light and almen tawght to pray as the
ſcripture Canonicall teachethe. But
there is an other yle as great as this to
be reprehendyd of all ſouche as know

how to pray a right. the benig of ymagis
in the temple whiche the worold
ſaythe may be ſuffryd in the churches.
And ſay they be godd to put the
people of God in remembrance of ſouche
godly ſaynctes as died for Chriſtes
ſake. But this is allwayes the ſubtylty
of the deuyll. when à manifeſt yle cannot
be born withall, to ſyk â gloſſe and
interpretacion that where ashe cannot
walke in the churche openly like à deuill,
and haue candelles, ſtyctkyd before
apoſt, and the ymayges kiſſyd, yet to
deſire ſom̄e man to put â fere Cote apon
his bake, that he may haue â place
in the churche to lurke in untill ſouche
tyme as occation be miniſtryd to ſhew
hymſelfe agayne as he is. The auctorite
of Godes word requirithe me to pronounce
this trew iudgmet in the cauſe
of ymagyes that be not worſhippid in
the churche that there preſence in the
churche is agaynſt godes word as well

as to ſay: Sancta Maria ora pronobis,
and as the on is to be eſchewyd and
baniſhid our of the hart ſo is the other
out of the yye in the temple where as
godes worde is preachid unto the people
and the ſacramētes miniſtryd. thus
I proue by the authorite of boothe Teſtamentes.
The old and the Newe the
old ſaythe thow ſhalt make no ymayge,
Exod. 20. Deu. 6. in the New there
is nomencion made of ony ymayge.
But that Chriſt concerning the law
and preceptes of the commaundementes
ſayd: Non ueni ſoluere legem, ſed
adimolere, Matth. 5. For aſmouche as
Chriſt lefft the commaundementes of
the old lawe unto the churche in the
which he ſaythe thow ſhalt not make
ony ymagye. From whens hathe this
men authorite that ſay if ymagys be
not honorid they may be ſuffrid in the
church it is but there opinion cōtrary
and beſyd the lawe of god. and this cō
               maundement

non facies, nō coles, for
byddith as well the makyng of the ymayge
as the honoring of it: Conſerning
the hauing of them in the place
of puplik prayer and uſe of his Sacramentes.
Souch as would this occaciō
of Idolatrie to remayne in the churche
by diuiſiō of the commaundementes
would paſſe ouer this ſecond commaundement
whiche ſaythe: Non facies
tibi ſculptile, non adorabis ea, and
mak of the tenthe commaundement
to cōmaundementes. But the text will
not ſuffre it. For as the lord there for
biddyth the inward luſt and concupiſtencence
of his neigbors houſe ſo
dothe he for byd the luſt and concupiſcence
of his neygbours wiefe ſeruāt,
Or dawghter and all is but one commaundement
Exo. 20. rede the text in
the Ebrew and then it ſhalbe more
playne. The ſecond commaundemēt
which the defenders of ymagyce neglect.

For bydith not only the outward
reuerence and honor but alſo
by the ſame expreſſe commaundemēt
for biddith to make ony ymayge they
do iniuries to the manifeſt text and
there gloſe is to be abhorrid. And the
playne text to be folowyd. The Kynges
maieſtie that ded is willyd not only
all his trew ſubiectes to haue no familiarite
withe Cardinal poule, but
alſo to refrayne his companie and not
to haue to do with hym in ony caſe
and not without godd and neceſſary
cōſyderation he that would: not with
ſtonding this commaunde, of the kyngis

withe ſouch other perſones as
ment no yle to the Kynges maieſtie or

right and equite condemne hym (nether
for frendiſhippe, nether oder cauſe
no man ſhuld uſe his cōpanie) Doutles
as the Kynges mayeſti and euery
other prince knowith it to be dangerous
dayli to ſuffre his ſubiectes in the
company of his treatorous Ennymies
ſo God knew right well what danger
it was to ſuffre man his creatur to haue
company withe thoſe ydoles and
therfore ſayde thow ſhalt nether worſhippe
them ner make them. All the
princes of ther the hathe not had ſomany
ſubiectes betrayd and made traytours
by there Ennymyes, as God hathe
looſt ſowles by the meanys of imagis
I make all the worold iudge that
knowithe the truithe. It is ſo childes
an opinion to ſay that ymagys may
be ſuffryd in the churche ſo they be
not honoryd, that it nedithe no probacion
at all the gentilles that Paule
ſpeakithe of, Roman. 1. knew right

well that the idoll was not God. And
all the Idolatres that uſid ymagies that
the new Teſtament ſpeakyth of 1. Co.
5. & 10. 1. Pet. 4. 1. Ioā. 5. kew right well
that theſe ymagys of gold or ſyluer
was not the deuill that they worſhippyd.
The apoſtes condemnyd not only
there falſe religion but alſo there
ymagis. Iohan by expreſſe wordes callithe
the ymayge, Idolatrye and byddith
them beware of ymagis ſayng cauete
â ſimulachris Dauid Pſal. 114. ſay
the Idola gentium argentum & aurum
he condemnithe not only there
falſe religion but alſo the ymagis made
by the hand of man. Which were
of gold and ſyluer. There falſe god
was nether gold nether ſyluer. But
awyckid ſprit who had entrid for lack
of faythe in to there ſprites. It is to
be lamentyd that god for our ſinnes
thus ſuffrythe the worold to be illudid
by the deuill. Of late yers the imagies

were in the temple and honoryd
withe pater noſter, hart and mynd
Withe legg and kne. This uſe of ymagis
is taken away in many places. But
now they be applyed to an other uſe,
ſcilicet to teache the people, and to be
the lay mennes bookes. As damaſcene
and many other ſaithe. Oh blaſphemous
and deuilliſ he doctrine to apoynt
the mooſt noble creature of god

reſembling the ymayge of the euer

pentyd blockes be the bookes of reſonable
man? full well can the deuill
transform himſelfe into an angell of
light. And to deceaue the people under

the pretenc of trew religion. I had
rather truſt to the ſhadow of the churche
that the ſcripture theachite, then to
all the mēnes writing ſithe the deathe
of Policarp 9. Chriſt ſayth not go preache
unto the people by ymagis. But
ſayd: Ite in uniuerſum mundum, &
praedicate euangeliū, Matth. 28. They
ſaye that ymagys adorn and ſemely
deek the temple of God whether as
people reſort to hyre the word of god
the more ymagys, the more diſhonoryd
is the temple Fyrſt let them teache
by the manifeſt word of God that the

ydoles that cannot teache nor ſpeke
ſome mannes tonge muſt declare the

And ſaynct cōcumbre, for the
rode of Paules: Balaam and his aſſe
that for lucre attemptid to curſe the

churche of god, for Chriſt and his Aſſe
that came to bliſſe and ſanctifie his
churche with his precious biud: it is
thabuſe and prophanacion of the temple
to ſuffre them, and a great occation
for people to return to there acuſtomyd
yle. I would all men ſhuld indifferently
poundre theſe reaſons and
iudge whether they be to be ſuffryd
or not. Fyrſt the mooſt perfeite churches
of the prophetes, Chriſte and his
Apoſtelles uſyd no ſouche meane to

Alſo the greak churche neuer conſentyd

            PAule Phillip. 2. ſaythe that Chriſt

ſacrifice of the old law were figures
and types of this only ſacrifice whiche

and his paſſion ſo dolorous, his deite
ſo obedient withe the fathers will,
that it was not only à ſacrifice, but alſo
à iuſt recompence, to ſatisfye for all
the worold ſoly and only as Chriſt
tawght Nicodemus Ioan. 3. as Paule
Ebre. 7. 8. 9. 10. Eſa. 53. and ſo all the
prophetes and patriarches: and ſouch
â ſacrifice as ons for all ſufficithe

Ebre. 7. theſe too officies of Chriſt
ſhuld neuer be out of remembraynce
They declare the infinite mercy of
god and likewyce his indifferent and
egall iuſtice unto all creatures without
reſpect of perſones. The token
of his mercy may be knoyn in this
that he would not that all man kynd
ſhuld be looſt, thoughe in Adam, all
deſeruyd eternall deathe he openyd
his mercy unto Adam not only by
word but alſo by the fyer that deſcendyd
upon his ſacrifices and his ſonnes
ſo to Abraam, then to the worold by
the incarnacion and deathe of his only
ſonne, the promeſſe of grace and
the promis of euer laſting lief unto
ſouche as repent and belyue in hym.
The ſignes of his Ire and diſpleaſure
unto man is this that he would not accept
man agayne into his fauour, for
no penence, no ſorow, no troble, no
aduerſite, no weping no wayling,

no nor for the deathe of oni perſon
Vntill his awne ſonne moſt dere belouid
by death appeced his diſpleaſur
and be cam ſuerty to ſatiffye the iuſtyce
of God and the right that the
deuyll had unto ull mankind. This
if man remembryd as depely and
as erneſtly as the mater requirithe, it
ſhuld make his hartfull ſory and brig
hym unto an honeſt and uertews trade
of lyffe. To conſider this example
of Godes iuſtice and equite in the appeſing
of his awne iuſt conceuyd Ire,
and lik wyce that he would do no
wrong unto his mortall Ennymy the
deuill except the ſone of god had byn
an aequall and iuſt redemption â pryce
correſpondent to contrepece and ſatisfie
the culpe and gilt of mannes ſinne,
God would not haue takē one ſoule
from the right and iuſtice of the deuill.
Now of this infallible truithe
that Chriſt hathe ſacrifici only for ſinne,

and his deathe accōptid only ſufficient
for the ſaluacion of man. The
churche of Chriſt is aryght iuſtructyd
of to mooſt neceſſarie articles. Firſt of
iuſtificacion, and then of the right uſe

            Caput VII.
            SAinct Paule whē heſaithe that we
be iuſtifyed by faythe, Rom. 3. 4. 5.
he menythe that we haue remiſſion of
ſinne, reconciliacion and acceptation
into the fauor of God ſo doothe this
word iuſtifie ſignifie, Deut. 25. hiſdich
where as God cōmaūdithe the iudge
to iuſtifie quit and abſolue the innocent,
and to cōdemne and puniſhe the
perſon culpable.
            Paule ſaythe we or iuſtied by faythe,
and not by workes: to be iuſtifyed

by faithe i Chriſt is aſmouche to ſay as
we optayne remiſſion of ſinne and ar
acceptyd into the fauor of god by the
merites of Chriſt. to be iuſtied by workes
is aſmouche to ſay, as to deſerue remiſſiō
of ſine by workes. Paule declarythe
that for the dethe and merites of
Chriſt we be ſauyd, and not by oure
awne uertewes ſo that faythe doothe
not only ſhew us Chriſt that died and
now ſittithe at the right hand of God,
but alſo applyythe the merites of this
deathe unto us and makyth Chriſt oures,
faythe layng nothyng to gayge
unto the iuſtice of God but the deathe
of Chriſt and there upō clemythe marci
and Godes promes the remiſſion of
ſinne. and deſyrythe God to iuſtyfye,
and delyuer the ſoule from the accuſacion
of the law and right of the deuill.
whiche he is bound to do for his promeſſe
ſak. Ezech. 33. Matth. 17. and altowghe
withe this remiſſion of ſinne

he yeuithe like wice. the holy gooſt to
work the will of God, to loue boothe
God and his neyghbowr not withſtō
               ding,
the conſcience burdenyd and
chargyd with ſinne: fyrſt ſekythe remiſſion
therof. For this thyng the conſcience
laborythe, and contendithe in
all feres and terrours of ſorow and cō
               trycion
it diſputithe not what uertewes
it bringith wreachid ſoule to accleme
this promis of mercy but for ſakyng
here awne iuſtice ofrithe Chriſt,
ded upon the croſſe and ſitting at Godes
right hand, Nothyng makithe it
the cauſe wherfore this mercy ſhuld
be yeuen ſauyng only the deathe of
Chriſt which is ton litron the only ſufficient
price and gayge for ſinne. And
althowghe it be neceſſary and requyſyt
that in the iuſtification of â ſynner
contricion to be preſent and that neceſſaryly
cherite and uertews lieffe
mooſt folow, yet dothe the ſcripture

attribute thonly remiſſion of ſyn̄e unto
the mercy of god wliche is yeuyne
only for the merites of Chriſte and receauid
ſoly by faythe, Paule doothe
not Exclude, thoſe uertewes to be preſent,
but he excludith the merites of
theſe uertews and deryuithe the cauſe
of our acceptation in to the grace of
god only for Chriſt. And Mark this
maner of ſpeache, fide iuſtificamur.
Hoc eſt fiducia miſericordie ſumus iuſti.
This word faythe, doth cōprehēd
as well à perſwacion and confidence,
that the promeſe of god appertaynith
unto him for Chriſtes ſakeas the knolege
of god. for faith thowghe it deſyre
the cōpany of Contricion and ſorow
for ſynne, yet contendith it not
in iudgmen, upon the merites of no
workes but only for the merites of
Chriſtes deathe in caſe it dyd, it auaylithe
nothing. For if a aman deſyre to
be delyūid from the law, the law muſt

be ſatisfied. Whiche ſaithe diliges do
minum deum tuum ex tota mente toto
corde, & ex omnibus uiribus. Deuteron.
6. Now there is nor neuer was
ony man born of the ſtoke of Adame
in originall ſynne that feryd god aſmouche
as the law requirithe nor neuer
had ſouche conſtant faythe as ys
requiryd, nor ſouche ardent loue as
it requirithe: ſeyng thoſe uertewes
that the law requiryd: be infirm and
debile, for there merites we can optayne
nothing of god, we muſt therfore
only truſt to the merites of Chriſt,
whiche ſatisfied the extreme iot and
uttermuſt point of the lawe for us and
this his iuſtice and perfection he imputithe
and cōmunicatithe withe us
by faythe: ſouche as ſay that only faythe
iuſtifiethe not, becauſe other uertewes
be preſent: they cānot tell what
they ſay: euery man that will haue his
cōſcience appeſyd mooſt Marke thoſe

too thynges. How remiſſion of ſynne
is optaynid: and wherfore it is optaynid
faythe is the meane wherby
it is optaynid: and the cauſe wherfore
it is receuid is the merites of Chriſt: althowgh
faythe by the meanes wherby
it is receauid yet hathe nether faythe
ner cherite, ner contricion, ner the
word of god nor all thoſe knyt to gather
ſufficient merites wherfore we
ſhuld optayne this remiſſion of ſynne.
But the only cauſe wherfore ſynne
is for yeuing is the deathe of Chriſt
Now Mark the wordes of Paule ffrely
ſaythe he wear iuſtified by his grace.
Let the man byrſt his hart withe
contricion, belyue that god is godd
athowſand tymes, burn in cherite, yet
ſhall not all theſe ſatisfie the law nor
delyuer man from the Ire of god untill
ſouch tyme as faythe lettithe fall
all hope and confidence in the merites
of ſouche uertewes as be in man,

and ſay lord behold thy unfrutefull
ſeruant, only for the merites of Chriſtes
blud yeue me remiſſion of ſynnes
for I know no man can be iuſtified other
wyce beforethe as Dauid ſayth:
Non iuſtificabitur in conſpectu tuo
omnis uiuens, Pſal. 143. agayne, Beatus
uir cui Dominus non imputat peccatum,
Pſal. 32. He that would marke
Chriſtes communication wythe that
Noble man and great Clerk Nicodemus,
Ioan. 3. Shuld be ſatisfyed how
and wherfore man is iuſtified, ſo plainly
that no aduerſary of the truithe
ſhuld hurt this infallible uerite ſole
faythe to iuſtifie. Nicodemus hauing
â good opinion althow not â ſufficiēt
knolege of Chriſt. Came unto hym by
night and confeſſyd hym to be ſent
from God, and that becauſe of ſouche
workes and miracles as he had
wrowght. Chriſt made anſwer Trewly
Nicodemus Iſay unto the Noman

can ſe the kyngdon of God except he
be born from â boue Nicodemus not
undreſtonding what Chriſt ment, Aſkid
him how an old mā could be born
agayne, and whether he could entre
his mothers belye, and then be born
agayne. Chriſte bringithe hym yet ner
unto the light that he might know
the meanes and ſaythe I tell the treuly
Nicodemus that noman can entre the
kyngdon of God Except he be born
of the water and the holy goſt &c. Nicodemus
confeſſyd yet agayne his ignorancy,
and deſyryd to be father inſtructyd
ſayng. How may theſe thynges
be. Chriſt anſwerid. Thow art the
great Maſter and Rabbi in Iſrael and
yet ignorant of theſe thynges Meanyng
that great and horrible muſt the
ignorancy of the people be: when there
doctors know not the trewthe. Nicodemus
confeſſing his ignorancye,
and receauing reproche at Chriſtes

hand, becauſe he toke upon hym to
teache other and yet â fole hym ſelfe
in the religiō of god. Might for ſhame
haue lefte Chriſt and his goſpell
yke, becauſe he now is made â ſcholer
that before was for his prudence and
lerning the cheffe of the Iewes. A phariſe
of mooſt notable eſtimacion.
Chriſt ſtreight way confortithe hym
all other lernid and unlernid, and ſaythe.
Noman aſcendithe into heauen,
Except he that deſcendyd from heauen,
the ſonne of man Whiche is in
heauen as thowghe Chriſt had ſayd
thus: diſcomfort not thy ſelfe Nycodemus
that althowghe thow be agreat
lernyd man and yet ignoraunt of
the wayes unto euer laſting lief: for
I promeſſe the there is noman lernyd
nor unlernid, that can of his awne
wit and lerning aſcend unto the knolege
of lief euer laſting but only he
that deſcendyd from heauen the ſone

of man whiche is in heauen. Now Nicodemus
being deſtitute of all worldly
and humane prudence and fynding
him ſelfe full unhable by wytt
or lerning to folow theffect of Chriſtes
preaching: cōſerning the meanes
of ſaluacion dependith only of the
mouth of Chriſte and diſputithe nomore
the mater, then Chriſte ſhewithe
hym the way and makithe â ladder
for Nicodemus wher withe he
may aſcend into heauen and ſaythe
this wayes thow mayſt underſtond
the thing I ſpek of. Sicut Moſes exaltauit
ſerpentem in deſerto, ita exaltari
oportet filium hominis: as Moſes lifft
upp the ſerpent in the deſert, ſo muſt
the ſonne of man belyfft uppe. This
hiſtory of the ſerpent was not unknowyn
unto this lernid man: albe it he
conſyderid not the myſtery and ſacrament
that it figurid. Now Chriſt teachithe
hym in this place to underſtōd

the lawe and becauſe this oration of
Chriſt wroten by ſanct Iohan is obſcure
and lackith â declaracion ſomwhat
of the purpoſe that Chriſt would
proue: omittit Ebreorum more alteram
ſimilitudinis partem. I will annex
the type and figure withe theffect
and myſtery of the figure and make
the text playne, Sicut Moſes exaltauit
ſerpentem in deſerto, ſic exaltari oportet
filiū hominis. Moſes was commaundid
to lifft upp this ſerpent in
the wildernes for this cauſe, that who
ſo euer was ſtong or uenemyd withe
the poyſon of the ſerpentes if he lokyd
upon the ſerpent of braſſe might
be helyd. Here is the cauſe and theffect
declaryd. Why the ſerpent was
lifft upp. Now to the wordes of
Chriſt. Ita exaltari oportet filium hominis,
ut omnis qui credit in illum nō
pereat, ſed habeat uitam aeternam, So
muſt Chriſt belyfft upp that as many

as beliue in him ſhal haue euer laſting
lieffe. Here is Nicodemus tawght the
way unto euer laſtīg lief and becauſe
he was adoctor of Moſes law Chriſt
by the law made open the mater unto
hym and browght hym from the ſhadow
unto the trew body and from
the letter, unto the underſtonding of
the letter ſayng as thoſe that by fayth
beheld the ſerpent were helyd of the
ſtynges of the ſerpent, ſo ſouche as behold
me in faythe hanging upon the
croſſe ſhalbe helid from there ſykenis
and ſinne that the deuyll by the ſerpēt
infectyd man kynd with all. Now let
us repet the text of Moſes againe, that
we may trewly undreſtond our ſauiours
wordes. Fac tibi Serpentem urentem,
& pone eum in palum in ſubli
me ſublatum, fiet
                  
                     
                  
                  que
                ſi ſerpens aliquem
momorderit, intueatur eum, & incolumis
erit. In theſe wordes is declaryd
thre thynges.
            
               
Fyrſt, why the ſerpent was ſet upp.
The cauſe: the people were ſtong withe
ſerpentes.
            Second: theffectt: the healthe of the
people.
            Thyrd: the uſe: that they ſhuld loke
upō hym. ſo Iohan declarythe whi
Chriſt was made man, thuſe, and theffect
of his humanite in theſe wordes:
Sic Deus dilexſt mundum, ut filium
ſuum unigenitum daret, ut omnis qui
credit in eum non pereat, ſed habeat uitam
aeternam. The cauſe of his cummyng
was the ſinne and ſikens of mā
betyn by the ſerpent in paradyſe: theffect
of his cumming was the healhe
of this ſikenis: the uſe of his cumming
was to belyue that his deathe upō the
croſſe was and is ſufficient for the remiſſion
of ſinne and to optayne eternall
lief. Here is the iuſtification of mā
lyuely expreſſyd. and how many thinges
concur as neceſſary unto the remiſſion

of ſinne and yet man only iuſtified
by faythe. The word of God, the
preacher of the word, Chriſt himſelfe,
the cōtricion of Nicodemus, the holy
gooſt that mouyd Nicodemusto cum
by night unto Chriſt, the conſentyng
wil of Nicodemus untho the wordes
of Chriſt. Yet only was hedelyueryd
from ſinne by the fayth that he had in
the deathe of Chriſt, as Chriſt ſaith: ſic
oportet exaltari filium hominis, ut omnis
qui credit in illum non pereat, ſed
habeat uitam aeternam. This muſt be
diligently markyd. For as the fathers
of the old church uſid the ſerpent, ſo
muſt thoſe of our church uſe the precious
body of Chriſt, they lokyd upon
him only withe the yees of faithe they
kyſſyd hym not, they caſt no water upon
hym and ſo wayſhyd there yeys
therwith all, they touchyd hym not
with there handes, they eat hym not
nor corporally, nor really, nor ſubſtancially,

yet by there belyue they optaynid
healthe, ſo Chriſt him ſelfe teachit
us the uſe of his precious body, to
belyue and loke upon the merites of
his paſſiō ſuffryd upon the croſſe and
ſo to uſe his precious body againſt the
ſtynge of originall and actuall ſinne.
Not to eat his body, transformid into
the form of bred, or in the bred with
the bread: under the bread. behind the
bred or be fore the bread, corporally,
or bodely ſubſtancially, or realli, inuiſible,
or ani ſouch wayes as mani men
to the great iniurijs of Chriſtes body
dooth teach, but as the children of Iſrael
only by fayth eat the body ſpiritually
not yet born, ſo by faythe dooth the
Chriſtianes eat hym now being aſcendyd
into heauen and none other wice
as Chriſt ſaythe unto Nicodemus: omnis
qui credit in eum, non pereat graūt
that we could as well eat his carnall
body, as we eat other meat yet the eatyng

therof nothing auaylyd. And
if the Apoſtelles had corporally eatin
hym in his laſt ſupper it had profetyd
nothing. For he toke not his body of
the holy uirgine to that uſe to be eatin
for the remiſſion ſinne Or to ſanctifie
hym that eat him, but to dye for
ſynne and that wayes to ſanctifie his
churche as he ſaith himſelfe: that only
by deathe the frute of his incarnacion
ſhuld be diſperſyd into the worold.
Niſi granū frumenti deiectum in terram
mortuum fuerit, ipſum ſolum manet:
mortua prodeſt caro, nō comeſa.
But of this Iwill ſpeake farther in the
chapiter that folowithe. This example
of Nicodemus declarithe, that neth
                  •
               r
the workes that go before iuſtificacion,
nether thoſe that folow iuſtification
deſerue remiſſion of ſynne.
Thoughe ſole faythe exclude not other
uertews to be preſent at the conuerſion
of euery ſinner, yet dooth ſole

fayth and only exclude the merites of
other uertews and optaynith ſoly remiſſion
of ſinne for Chriſtes ſake herſelfe
alone as paule ſaythe Epheſ. 2.
Gratia ſaluati eſtis per fidem, id
                  
                     
                  
                  que
                non
ex uobis, Dei donum eſt, non ex operi
bus ne quis glorietur. Wher as playnly
he excludith the dignite of workes,
and affirmith us to be reconcilid
by faythe, ſo dooth Iohan. cap. 1. attribut
thoſe too ſinguler yefftes unto
Chriſt, grace and uerite ſayng: lex per
Moſen data eſt, gratia & ueritas per
Ieſum Chriſtum facta eſt. Here grace
ſignifieth fre remiſſion of ſinne for
the merites of Chriſt. Verite is the
trew knolege of god and the gyfftes
off the holy goſt that folowithe the
remiſſion of ſinne. Therfore ſouche
as ſay, they be not iuſtified only by faithe
in the mercye of god throwgh
Chriſt, extenuat ſynne and godes Ire
agaynſt ſyn̄e to mouche, and likwyce

ſpoyle Chriſte of his honor Who is
the onli ſacrifice that takith away the
ſynne of the worold. They that will
iuſtifie them ſelfes ony other wayes
then by fayth, doothe dout all wayes
whether there ſinnis be for yeuen or
not and by reaſon of this dout they
can neuer pray unto god aright for he
that doutith whether god be his frēd
or not, prayeth not: but as an Ethnyke
ſaythe his pater noſter with out faith
and godly mocion of the hart. He
that is ꝑſuadid by the goſpell, thowgh
his awne unworthynis fere him from
God yet beholdith he the ſon̄e of god
and belyuithe that bothe he hand his
prayers be acceptid in Chriſt and thus
acceptyd into grace will folow the lyue
of â iuſtified man, as Paule cōmaū
               dith
Ro. 8. Coloſſ. 3. and as all the ſcripture
yeuith example, for it is no profet
to ſay, ſole fayth iuſtifieth, except
godlinis of lief folow as Paule ſayth

ſi ſecundum earnem uixeritis moriemini,
he that hathe opteinyd the remiſſion
of ſinne muſt diligently pray for
the preſeruacion of Godes fauor as
Dauid yeuith example unto the hole
churche ſaing: Cor mundum crea in
medeus, & ſpiritum rectum innoua in
uiceribus meis. Ne proijcias me â facie
tua, & Spiritum ſanctum tuum ne auferas
à me Redde mihi leticiam ſalutaris
tui. & ſpiritu principali ſuffulci
me, Pſalm. 50. This prayer conteynith
â wounderfull doctrine and neceſſari
to be dayli repetyd with great attenci
on and hede firſt he defyryth to haue
â hart pure and net, iudgyng â right of
God, to fere his iuſtice agaynſt ſinne
and to beliue ſtedfaſtly his promiſyd
merci unto the penitēces and that this
light and knolege be not taken from
hym by the deuill or uanite of the worold,
as dayly we ſe ſouch as hatb, the
knolege of Godes word, to lyue more

worldly thē he that knoith not what
god is, then prayth to haue the helpe
of god to gouern all his counſells and
all the motions of his hart that they
may be agreable unto the law of god,
full of fayth, fere and cherite, that for
ſynne he be no more caſt out from the
face and fauor of god, prayth to haue
ſtrength in aduerſite, and to reyoyce
under the croſſe of affliction, not to
murmur nor grug at ony troble but to
obey willingly the pleaſure of god,
not to leaue hym, nor miſtruſt his mercy
for ony puniſhment, but to ſuffre
what god pleacyth, as mouch as god
pleaſith, and when god pleacyth: theſe
uertewes muſt man practyſe an uſe
affter he is iuſtified, as well as to optaine
remiſſion of his ſinne, or elſe he is
not iuſtified at all, he is but â ſpeaker
of iuſtificacion, and hathe no iuſtice
within hym. As he makith Chriſt only
his ſauior, ſo muſt he folow ſouch

as were of Chriſtis familie the patriarches,
prophetes and the Apoſtelles in
the lyffe preſcribid by Chriſt as they
dyd, or elſe they ſhalbe no diſciples
of the prophetes that were the doers
as well as the ſpeakers of uertewe.
But rather the diſciples of the poetes
that only commendyd uertew and folowid
it not as ouid ſaythe, Eſt deus
in nobis, agitante caleſcimus illo: Sedibus
aetherijs, ſpiritus ille uenit. Theſe
holy wordes auaylyd nothing. Souch
as cannot underſtond the Epiſtole of
Paule to the Romaynes conſerning
iuſtification and what lief is requirid
of hym that is iuſtified, let hym red diligently
the fyrſt Epiſtole of Iohan,
and then he ſhall right well perceaue
an other lyffe to be requirid of the iuſtified
man, then the goſpellers led
now aday that hathe wordes, with
out factes Which ſlaunderith the goſpell
and promotith it not, as it is to be

ſen (the more pety) in ſouche mē and
ſouche cornteis as the truith hath byn
prechid along tyme. For the receuing
of it unwortyly the lord will doutles
take from them his worde, and leaue
them unto there awne luſtes. For this
is certaine and to trew, let the hole goſpell
be preachid unto the worold, as
it awght to be penence and à uertuſe
lieff withe faythe, as God preachyd
the goſpell unto Adam in Paradyſe,
Noe, Abrahā, Moſes, Eſay: ſaing: uegenti
pecatrici, Iohan the Baptiſt: poenitencam
agite, appropinquat regnū
coelorum. As Chriſt did: Recipiſcite
& ctedlte Euangelio, Mar. 1. and then
of an hūdred that cōmith to the goſpel
there would not com one: when they
here ſole faythe and the mercy of god
to iuſtiſie and that they may eat all meates
at all tymes with thankes yeuing,
they imbraſe that goſpell with all Ioy
and willing hart. And what is he that

would not receaue this goſpell, thefleſ
he itſelfe were there no im̄ortal ſoule
in it, would receue this goſpell, becauſe
it promiſithe ayd healpe and conſolacion
with out workes, and when it
hyrythe that it may as well eat â paſtie
of ueniſiin upon the frydaye as à heryn,
what is he that would not be ſouche
agoſpeller? But now ſpek of the
other part of the goſpel as Paule teachith
to the Romaynes 8. cap. Si ſecundum
carnem uixeritis moricmini. and
as he preſcribith the lieff of à iuſtified
man, in the ſame Epiſt. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16.
capite. Chriſt Matt. 10. Peter, 2. Petri 1.
he that is iuſtified let hym ſtudy thoſe
canones to lyue by.
            Sainct Paule, writithe to â iuſtified
churche of the Corinthions and to ſouche
as had receauid the knolege of the
goſpel, and ſayth: Si quis cum frater
appelletur, fuerit ſcortator, aut auarus
aut ſimulachrorum cultor, aut conuiciator,

aut ebrioſus, aut rapax, cū eiuſmodi
ne cibum capiatis, 1. Cor. 5. This
part of the goſpell, is not ſo pleaſaunt
as the other: therfore men take the firſt
libertye, and neglect the frutes that
ſhuld folow the goſpell, and think thē
ſelfes to be riche in the goſpell as the
churche of the Laodicenſes iudgid of
them ſelfes, Apocalip. 3. when they be
indede miſerable and wreachid: poure
and nakyd of all godlynys. Paule declarithe
Rom. 8. what It is to be iuſtified
and to be in Chriſt to walke affter
the ſprit he ſeythe: Nulla condemnatio
eſt lex his, qui ſunt in Chriſto Ieſu
qui ſecundum ſpiritum ambulāt. For
â concluſion, iuſtification is à fre remiſſion
of ſinne and acceptation into
tbe fauor of God for Chriſtes merites
the whyche remiſſion of ſynne muſt
folow neceſſaryly amendment of
lyffe, or elſe we receaue the grace of
God inuayne, 2. Cor. 6. Ro. 8. 2. Petri 1.
         
         
            
            Caput VIII.
            OF this infallible uerite only the
deathe of Chriſt to be the ſacrifice
for the expiacion of ſinne may be
neceſſarily tawght the right and trew
uſe of the Lordes ſupper which men
call the Maſſe. Fyrſt it is manifeſt that
it is not â ſacrifice for ſinne as men teache
contrary unto the word of god
that ſaythe Chriſt by one ſacrifice made
perfet all thinges Ebre. 7. 8. 9. 10.
and as Iohan. ſaythe, Sanguis Ieſu
Chriſti emundat nos â peccatis and
there remaynithe nomore after it as
Paule ſaith, Vbi peccatorum remiſſio
ibi nō amplius hoſtia pro peccato and
to take away all dout that remiſſion
of ſinne cānot be optaynid for the me
rites of the maſſe Paule ſaith playnely
that without bludſhedding no ſacrifice
can merite remiſſion of ſinne. Althowge
Chriſt now ſit at the ringht

hand of god and pray for his churche
and like wice dothe offre the prayers
and complaynt of us that belyue: yet
it is only for the merites of his deathe
that we optayne the mercy of godes
promeſſe, in the whiche he ſuſteynid
ſouche payne that the remembraunce
therof, and the greatnis of godes
Ire agaynſt ſynne, put his precious body
and ſolle in ſouch an agony and fere,
that his paſſion of ſorow ſurmountyd,
the paſſions, of all men that euer
trauelyd: or were bordenyd with the
weight and peace of godes importable
Ire agaynſt man for ſyn̄, in ſo mouche
that he wept not only tyres of
blud, but ſo aboundantly, payne forſid
them to deſcend that they trycklid
upon the growne. Sore troblyd and
ouer cō with ſorow was Dauid Pſa. 6
When he wayſhyd his bed withe tyres
for ſynne, but it was Ioy and myrthe
if his paynes be conferrid to theſe

dolores of Chriſt. They wantyd no
augmentation, this ſacrifice was kyllyd
alitle, and alitle, from one place of
iudgment ſend unto the other, and all
wayes from the flames, into the ardēt
coles, his deathe upon the croſſe ſo differryd,
that altowgh he was uery god
and the dere belouid ſon of the ffather
his abiection was ſo contemptible ād
uile▪ that he cried out as Aman mooſt
deſtitute of godes fauor and loue: and
ſayd: Deus meus, Deus meus, quare
dereliquiſti me? And untill ſouch tyme
as he offryd his mooſt holy ſoule
unto the father and his bleſſid ſide percid
with the ſpere, his paines and ſorowes
increſſyd. Lo thus was the maner
to offre Chriſt for ſinne affter this ſort
and cruell handelyng of Chriſt was
theire of God apecid, If they ſacrifice
Chriſt in the maſſe, let thē hange hym
tyrauntes agayne upon the croſſe and
thruſt â ſpere to his bleſſid hart, that he

may ſhed his blud for with out ſchedding
of blud is no remiſſion: the ſcripture
damnythe this abuſe of the lordes
ſupꝑ, and is the cōculcation of his
precious blud. As concerning the uſe
of this Sacrament and all other The
rites ād ceremonijs that be godly they
ſhuld be ſo kept, and uſyd in the churche,
as they were deliueryd unto us of
the highe Biſhope Chriſt, the auctor
of all Sacramentes. For this is trew
that he mooſt godly: mooſt religiouſi:
and mooſt perfetly: inſtitutyd and celebratyd
the ſupper. And None other
wayes then the Euangeliſt doothe record.
the beſt maner and mooſt godly
way to celebrat this ſupper is to preache
the deathe of Chriſt unto the churche.
And the redemption of man: as
Chriſt did at his ſupper, and there to
haue commune prayers as Chriſt prayed
with his diſciples, then to repet the
laſt wordes of the ſupper and with the

ſame to breake the bread and diſtribute
the winne to the hole church. Then
yeuyng thankes to God: depart in peace:
theſe ceremonijs that God inſtitutyd
not But repugneth Godes inſtitution
be not neceſſari but rether in ony
caſe to be leffte becauſe they abrogat
the inſtitution of Chriſt. it ſemithe ſufficient
unto me if the churche do as
Chriſt hath commaundid it to do.

yeres wrote his Epiſtole and ſayd he
would delyuer them nothing but that
he had receauid of the lord and wrote
conſerning the uſe of the ſupper as
Matth. Mark. and Luk writithe this
is therfore and ungodly diſputacion
that the Papiſtes contend abut the chā
               ge
and alteracion of the bread, and alſo
à falſe ād pernicious doctrine, that
teachyth the corporall preſence of
Chriſt, booth God and man in the

bread for althowgh Chriſt ſaid of the
bread this mi body. It is well knowyn
that he purpoſid to inſtitute à ſacrament.
Therfore he ſpak of à ſacramēt
ſacramentally. To ſpek ſacramentally
is to gyne the Name of the thing to
the ſigne, ſo, yet not withſtōding
that
the nature and ſubſtaince of the ſigne
remaynit and is not turnid into the
thing that it ſignifiet, farther the uerite
of the ſcripture and the uerite of à
Chriſtiane faith will not ſuffre to iudge
and belyue Chriſtes body inuiſible
or uiſible to be upon the Erth Act. 1.
Luce ult. Mar. ult. Act. 3. If we lik wyce
conſyder the other places of the ſcripture
Ioan. 6. 16. 17. we ſhall fynd that
Chriſt would not nor ment not, to inſtitute
ony corporall preſence of his
body: But à memory of the body ſlayne
reſuſcitatyd, aſcendid into heuens
and from thenſe to cū unto iudgment,
trew it is that the body is eatin and the

blud dronkyn but not corporally in
faith and ſprit it is eatyn, and by that
ſacrament the promis of god ſealyd
and cōfirmid in us. The corporall body
remayning in heuyn, in the 24 chapiter
of Matthew, Chriſt yeuing his
church warning of this hereſy to cum
by the preaching of falſe Prophetes
ſayd, they will ſay, lo here is Chriſte, lo
there is Chriſt, belyue them not, for as
the lightynyng cōmith from the eſt
into the weſt ſo ſhall the cumming of
the ſone of man be, meanyg by theſe
wordes that his body is not à phantaſticall
bodi, nor inuifible as theſe teach
that ſay his corporall body is corporally
yeuen in the bread with the bred
and under the bred inuiſible, Agaynſt
this errour I will ſet the word of God
and declare the truith therbi, that they
haue but an ymagynaciō or ydeam of
Chriſtes body, and not the natural, ād
corporall body. and the fyrſt reaſon is

this. Chriſte byd his diſceples they
ſhuld not belyue hym that ſhuld ſay.
Lo here is Chriſt or there is Chriſt. he
ſpake of his body doutles and humaine
nature for he commaundith us to
belyue that his godhed is eueri where
as Dauid ſayth. and as he ſayth, my father
and Iamone likwyce, he told thē
be playne wordes Math. the laſt capi.
that he would be with them unto the
end of the worold. Chriſt hauing but
too natures one deuine and the other
humane by theſe expreſſe wordes
now he declarithe to be preſent with
the one, and abſent with the other. theſe
thinges markyd I put this mater incompryſſe
to be iudgid of euery humble
and cheritable ſprytyd man, who
iudgithe aright of the body of Chriſt
thoſe that ſay bodely he is not in the
ſacramēt, or theſe that ſay he is bodely
and corporalli there. If he be there corporally
and bodely as they ſay. Why

ſhall Inot beliue theſe wordes: Ecce
hic: ecce illic, and ſay Chriſt lyyth that
ſayd beliue them not that ſay lo here
is my body or there is my bodi Chriſt
hauyng God experience of the deuillis
ſubtilty, that he would intoxcitat
the wit of man with more ſubtill reaſones
then the ſimple hart could eſchew
preparyd of his mercy amenys to preſerue

corporally: belyue them not, truſt to
thyn lye for as the lightning ſenſible

howſo? Turnyd into fyre. no: ſo uiſible
and ſenſible, God wyſt right well
when he callyd mā from reaſon to the
iudgment of his ſenſes. what Doctors

and doctrine ſhuld folow of his ſenſible
body one to change acak into his
body, and an other to teache though
the cak be not his body, yet is his body
preſent corporally ſubſtantially, really,
bodely, the ſame body that hankyd
upon the croſe and is yeuen by
hand, with the bred. Vnder the bred
and in the hred, and yet inſenſenſible.
Graunt all there gloſes and interpretations
to be trew as they be mooſt falſe,
and ſay as they would haue it, that
the uery trew humanite, and Chriſt in
the trew ſhape and form of aman as
he is with all qualites and quantities
except ſynne and immortalite to be in
the bred, under the bred, or with the
brod, after the bred or before the bred
and ſay there is preſent in the priſtes
hand as great abody and as naturall
aman as the pryſt or miniſter is himſelfe:
the word of god made man: ſo
they would haue it: they ſhal neuer

deceaue agodly Chriſtiane with there
gloſes, for he will truſt unto the ſimplicite
of godes word that ſayth Nolite
credere, belyue them not till they
ſhew my body unto the ſenſes, for as
the lighe thing. The defenders of this
doctrine becauſe they be not able to
auſwer unto ſouch as wrytith and
preachith the truith: they chalinge
and attrribut unto them ſelfes thonly
knolege of truith, and ſai there contrarijs

them graunt there wore none lernyd
that defendith this truith as therebe hathe

and becauſe noman ſhuld in this mater
leaue she truithe, thowghe better
lernyd then he iudg phantaſtically of

they ſay this place makith not againſt
the preſence of Chriſtes body in the ſacrament,
But agaynſt ſouch as ſhuld
preach in the Later dayes falſe doctrine
againſt Chriſtes doctrine: and mak
an other Chriſt: trew it is he ſpekith of
ſouch as ſhuld preach falſe doctryne:
but what ſhuld be that falſe doctrine,
that could be ouer cō with theſe wordes:
Nolite credere ſicut fulgetum coruſcans
uenit ab Oriente in Occidente,
ita erit aduētus filius hominis, what
hereſi redith ony man in the hiſtorijs
to be uanquiſhid by theſe wordes, not
of Samoſatenus that was condemnid
in the concell of Nece. Not of Neſtor
that denyed too natures to be unit in
Chriſt Nor of Eutiches that ſayd one

nature was conuertyd into the other.
None of the hereſis that the deuill mouid
agaynſt the eſſence and diuine
Maieſti of god as Marcion and the
Manicheis that ſayd there were too
godes and booth eternall, the one god
and the other yle all wayes the one repugnat
to the other. Nether yet the hereſy
of Valentiniane that ſayd there
were nnumerable godes but this falſe
doctrine Chriſt ſpake: by ſouch as would
aſter his aſcenſion into heuen corporally
yet preach in the later dayes
unto the people that his body ſhuld
be in the erthe. And therfore gaue thē
theſe wordes belyue them not, for as
the lightning commithe from the eſt
to the weſt ſo ſhall the cumming of
the ſonne of man be, Chriſt ſpake of
thoſe that ſhuld deceaue the people
in the time betwyne his aſcēſion and
comming to iudgment, for in the end
of the worold it ſhalbe no nede to bid

us beware for all falſe preachers ſhall
be damnyd when his glorious body
ſhall opere. He that belyuith before
that the naturall body of Chriſt cā be
here oni way corporally, neglecth
the commandement of Chriſt, Nolite
credere, Matt. 24. and likwyce for
gotith his crede, Sedet ad dextram
patris, inde uenturus eſt &c. and Luk
ſayth plainly that as uiſible as he aſcē
               did,
ſo ſhall he deſcēd at the latter day
and not before as he ſayth. Acto. 3. be
cauſe they defend there opiniō by the
wrong interpreation of the wordes in
the Articles of our faith I will anſwere
to one or to obiections that they make
fyrſt they ſay that this word heuen
in the article of our foyth, aſcendit ad
coelos, ſignifieth no certaine and determinat
place but generalli all the worold
heuē, ert, ād hell where ſo euer godes
poure be manifeſtyd. and ſo ſaithe
that the right hand of God be tokith

no place. but the hole pore of God. as
when I ſay: Sedet ad dextram Dei. It is
aſmouche to ſay as he is in his humanite
euery where as his diuite is. Vnto
the firſt this i anſwere. that heuē in no
place of the ſcripture is ſo taken towghe
it ſignifie ſom tyme all the celeſtal
bodies aboue, heuens eternall, and the
it ſignifieth the ayre: as. Pſal. 149. à quae
quae ſupra coelos ſunt laudent nomen
domini. And ſomtyme it ſignifieth only
the ſuppre place of creatures as in
the ſame Pſalme: Laudate eum coeli ſupremi.
Into theſe ſuperior heuens
Chriſt aſcendid as the maner of his aſcenſion
declaryth, Luc. ultimo. Acto.
1. He tok his diſciples withe hī into the
mount of olyuet, and byd them there
farewell he departid bodely from thē

could nomore be ſen yet what became
of this body affter that it paſſyd
there ſight that no queſtion afterward

ſhuld be where this body was
becom, Luc ſayth. Ferebatur in coelum,
capit. ultimo. This mutation of
place to aſcēd from the erthe only his
humane nature ſuffryth, concernyng
his God hed it is euery where, and can
nether aſcend nor deſcend ſouche as
ſay that heuen and the right hand of
God is in the articles of our faith takē
for godes pore ād might which is euery
where, they do wrōg to the ſeripture
and unto the articles of our fayth
they mak à confuſion of the ſcripture
and leaue nothing certayne the darkyn
the ſimple and playne uerite therof
with intollerable ſophiſmes the
make heuen: hell: and hell heuen torn
upp ſide downe and peruert the order
of God: if the heauen and godes right
hand whether our ſaniours body is aſcendyd
be euery where and notith
no certayne place as theſe uncertayne
men teach, I will belyuc no aſcenſion

what nedith it ſeing Chriſtes body is
euery where with his goded. I will
interpretat this article of my crede
thus: Chriſtus aſcendit ad dextram patris,
patris dextra eſt ubi
                  
                     
                  
                  que
               , ergo Chriſtus
aſcendit ad ubi
                  
                     
                  
                  que
               . Se what erronyus
doctryne folowith there imaginacions.
As cōſerning the right hand
of God it is taken ſomtyme for God
hymſelfe and his omnipotent poure.
Pſalm. 117. dextra domini fecit uirtutem,
dextra domini exaltauit me. thus
his right hand taken for his poore it is
euery where. But it is not ſo taken,
when whe ſay Chriſt ſittithe at the
right hand of God. As mark ſaith. capit.
ultimo and as Stephen ſayd, Act.
7. Video Ieſum ſtantem à dextris Dei.
But it ſignifieth acertayne place of Ioy
where as the ſowles of the bleſſyd ſanctes
reſt. thether hathe God tranſlatyd
the body of Chriſt to be in as mouche
Ioy, as it was incontempt here in

the erthe as Paule ſaythe Philip. 2. Sitting
thus at the right hand of god. his
body, is as trew man as it was upō the
erthe and in lenghe breath and weight
as phiſicall, matematical, and naturall
abody as it was hanging upō the croſſe,
in the changing of mortale qualites
the humanite of Chriſte is nether deſtroyd,
nor changid into his deite. but
as trewly as his godhed cōcerning his
eſſence cannot be ſen. ſo is his body
wher ſo euer it be: ſubiect unto the iudgmēt
of the ſenſes. And as he that makith
à houſe firſt conceuithe à trew
form in his imaginacion and yet the
imaginacion nor concept of the mind
is not materiali the houſe ſo ſouche as
dreame and imagine à certayne phantaſie
and reduce the form and figure
of à trew body into there imagination
is not à trew body, but à cōcept or imaginacion
of à body, as thoſe men haue,
that ſay Chriſt is in the bread and

with the bread yet ocopy yth it no place,
nor is not ſenſible. This is a wounderful
doctrine, to make that glorious
body of Chriſt to be à trew body, and
yet lackith all the qualites and quantites
of à body, if Chriſt could haue ſouche
à dreming body, as they ſpek of
yet may I not belyue, it is in the ſacrament
corporally becauſe Chriſt ſayth
Nolite credere. And where they would
better the mater with theſe wordes
that Chriſt in the tyme of his being
upon therthe dyd many thinges
aboue the nature of abody and caryd
his body ſometime inuiſible, and entryd
the houſe of the diſciples the gates
being ſhut, they proue nothing,
only the troble the ſimple conſciens,
and ſtablyſh ſouch as be more addict
unto the wryting of man then unto
the wryting of god in there errour.
Peter walkid upon the water, yet was
uery man nothing the leſſe ſo it pleacyd

god to uſe his creatures to his glori.
Chriſtes body was nothing changyd
all thoughe ſomtymes for fere of
the ſtones, he conueyd hymſelf out of
the way, thowghe his diſciples knew
not how he entryd the dores being
ſhit, it is poſſible Inowg that he openyd
the dores and yet they perceauid
it not: mens yeyes be obedient unto
the creatour that they may ſe on think
and yet not à nother. The ſcripture ſo
teachite. thoſe yle men that would haue
don uilanye unto the angelles in
loothes houſe Gene. 19. were made ſo
blynd they could not fynd the next
dore to them, yet byd lothes houſe ſtill
in one place, the ſame may ye rede 4.
Reg. 6. how god made blind the aſſirians
hoſte ſo that Elizeus led the hole
army into the cite of Samarie. Balaam
ſaw to bet his Aſſe, And yet could

Num. 22. here may ye ſe that thoſe reaſones
ꝓuith nothing, that they would
Chriſtes bodi to be in the ſacramēt becauſe
ſōtimes he would not be ſen of
his ennymys. This is oure belyue that
Chriſt is ueri man and lik unto his brothers,
Ebr. 2. therefore where ſo euer
his body be it muſt haue the qualites
and quantites of à trew man, if his body
be corporally in the ſacrament and
yet with out all propertis of à trew body,
this text is falſe habitu iuuentus
ut homo likwyce this ſimilis eſt fratri
bus per omnia? They graunt that only
the ſprit of man eatithe the bodi of
Chriſt in the ſacramēt: then other the
ſprit of man is turnyd into â corporall
ſubſtance, or elſe the body of Chriſt loſtithe
his corporall ſubſtance and is
becom à ſprit: for it is not poſſibile for
the ſprit of man to eat corporally à
corporall body: nomore then he that
ſtudith the ſcripture and commēdith

the contentes of the Bible to his memorie,
eatith corporalli the booke: but
by the helpe of godes ſprit and his awne
diligence he eatith theffect, Marie
and doctrine of the Bible and incaſe it
were corporally and ſubſtancially withe
paper and ynk in the botom of the
ſee yet the lernid man may cōfort him
ſelfe and teache the maryners in the
ſhippe with the cōtentes therof thowghe
the corporall Bible be drowid. So
in the ſacrament the Chriſtiane hart
that is inſtructid in the law of god and
knowith the right uſe of the ſacramentes,
by the holy gooſt and afyrm fayth
that he hath in the merites of Chriſtes
body and ſoule which is aſcendid corporally
into heuen, man in ſprit receaue
theffect, Marrye, ſwetnys, and commodite
of Chriſtes precious body
thowg it neuer deſcend corporally,
thus dooth faith and the ſcripture cō
               pell
the churche to be lyue. Whē they

ſay it is in the ſacrament and yeth mouith
not from the right hand of God
I belyue not there ſayng: but require
aprobation therof Chriſt hath not ſo
great à body to fill heuen and erthe
corporally ſimilis eſt fratribus perfectus
deus & perfectus homo, they make
hym there and yet ocopy no place,
then it is no body for à trew body phiſicall
and matematical: as Chriſtes body
is: cannot be except it ocopi place
they ſay I muſt belyue and ſay with
the uirgine, Ecceancilla domini. I mai
not ſeke to know the meanes how,
Well let them do aſmouch to me in
this mater as was don unto the uirgine
Mari and I am content, ſhe could
not comprehend how Chriſt was made
man in here bely, yet theffect and
corporall natyuite of Chriſt aſſertaynyd
booth here reaſon and ſenſes
that ſhe had born à trew bodi. It ſhal
ſuffice me if they mak demonſtraciō
               
unto my ſenſes and warrant my reaſon
that they haue preſent à corporall
body: how it cummith and by what
meanes I leaue that unto god but untill
ſouch tyme as they ſhew me that
glorious and perfeit mannes body of
Chriſt as it was ſhewid unto the bleſſid
uirgine there ſayng: belyue: belyue:
ſhall not com into my belyue for
Chriſt ſaith, Nolite credere. Of Chriſtes
wordes Marci 13. de die illo nemoſcit,
the moment of the laſt tyme No
man knowithe, nether the ſonne of
god in aſmouche as he is man I gather
this argument. A maiori, if it be denied
Chriſt concerning his man hed to
know the laſt day: mouch more to be
euery where, or to be in diuer places
at one tyme is denied his humanite,
for it is more īpoſſible and wounderfull
to be euery where then to know
many thinges. I kno the Geographus
conceuithe and cōprehendithe all the

worold in his hed. But to be in all places
where as his thowghtes and ſprit
is ocopyed it is impoſſible farther
Chriſt is body hathe not looſt his corporall
qualites, but wher ſo euer he be
corporaly, there is he with all qualites
of abody, and not withe out qualites,
as theſe dreamers imagine. I will not
iudge my ſauiour that died for the ſinne
of the worold to haue abody in heuen
ſenſible with all qualites of trew
man and in the ſacrament with out all
qualites and quantites of à trew body
But abhor and deteſt with the ſcriptura
this opinion as an hereſy, ſo litle differing
from marcion that I can ſcarſe
put diuerſite: as corporally is the corporall
and ſubſtantiall body of all
Englond in the hed of hym that deſcribith
by mape or cart, the hole Realme
in Italy or other wher: ſo corporally
is the body of Chriſt in the hart
of the Chriſtian. The concept imaginacion

or form conceuid of Englond
is not the body mater nor ſubſtance
ſelfe of inglond, no more is the ſpirituall
cōcept of Chriſtes body, the corporall
body it ſelfe thowg Auicen
and Auerrois would prow ſouch à
concluſion yet the fayth of our Religion
will not ſuffre it: à Pantaſticall
imagination to be à trew ſubſtannce
to ſay that Chriſtes uere naturall body
is in the erth and yet inuiſible it is
to deſtroy the body and not to honor
the body. Ariſtole li. 5. metaphiſicorū
cap. 22. definit what inuiſible is: inuiſible
(inquit) eſt quod non habet omni
no colorem. Take this from Chriſtes
body that it is trewly in the ſacrament
corporally and yet inuiſible, is to ſay
Chriſt hath loſt all the colour ſhape
and form of his humanite. But what
ſhall Ariſtolle do in this our fayth,
the ſcripture teachith what we ſhuld
belyue aſcendit ad coelos, ſedet ad dex

tram Dei patris omnipotentis. Inde uē
               turus

Act. 1. Mar, ultimo, Luc. ultimo. And
hath leffte us à ſacrament of his bleſſid
body the which wear bond to uſe religiouſy
and many times to exerciſe
and ſtabliſh our fayth, and he being
abſent corporally dooth communicat
by fayth in ſprit that moſt precious body
and the merites of the ſame, and
would to god peple would uſe it with
more reuerēce and more awght as the
ſcriptur teachith, with trew amendemet
of lieff and fyrm fayth. I pout out
a book in Septembre laſt paſt dedycatyd
to my lord of wincheffter where
in I haue declarid all my fayth conſerning
this bleſſyd and holy ſacrament,
therfor I will paſſe to the other offyce
of Chriſtes pryſhed.
         
         
            Caput IX.
            
               
THe fourthe offyce of Chriſt is to
conſecrat and ſanctifie theſe that
beliue in him. He is not onli holy
him ſelf but makith holy others alſo.
As he ſaythe Ioā. 17. Pro eis ſanctifico
meipſum, ut ſint & ipſi ſanctificati perueritatem.
this ſanctification is none
other but à trew knolege of God in
Chriſt by the goſpell that teachyth us
how unclene wear by the ſinne of
Adamme, an how that wear clenſid
by Chriſt for who is ſake the father of
heauen doothe not only remitt the ſinnes
wrowght willyngly agaynſt the
word of God. but alſo the imperfectiōn
and naturall concupiſcens whiche
remaynythe in euery man as long as
the nature of man is mortall. How the
father dooth ſanctifie his people the
prayer of Chriſt ſhewith Ioan. 17. ſanctifica
eos per ueritatem tuam. ſanctifie
them by thy word purche the hart,
teache them, halow them make them

apt for thy kyngdon. wherwithe? withe
thy worde which is euer laſtīg uerite.
The meās to ſanctifie is the word of
God, the holy goſt and faith that receuith
the word of our redemption ſo
doothe Peter ſay, Acto. 15. Fide purgari
corda noſtra. Here is the cauſe expreſſyd
wherby we accept our ſanctificacion
by fayth ſayth ſanct Peter
ſaynct Paule. 1. Corint. 6. ſhewith for
whois ſake and wherfore we ar ſanctified.
Abluti eſtis, ſanctificati eſtis, iuſtificati
eſtis per nomen domini Ieſu ꝑ
ſpiritum Dei noſtri. For the merites of
Ieſus Chriſte by the operacion of the
holy gooſt. This is to be allwaies markyd,
that when Chriſt had prayed his
father to ſanctifie his church by his
word, and by his holy ſprit and deſtityd
hym: to preſerue them from ile for
his mercys ſake He addid the pryce
the merites and iuſt deſeruyng of Godes
graces and ſayd I ſanctifie my ſelfe

for them becauſe they may be ſanctified
by the truith. He ſanctified hymſelfe
for the churche when he died for
the deteſtable unclenys and fylthinis
therof more ſtynkyng and fylthy thē
               euer
was the thaborryd and leporous
bodi of Lazar 9. as tawghe he had ſaid
for aſmouch as I offer ād ſubmitt myſelfe
unto the bytter and cruell payne
of the croſſe for the church thow muſt
moſt holy father ſanctifie them, and
accept them as ſanctified, noryſh thē
loue them, and defend them for the price
and ſatisfactiō of my deathe. what
à conſolacion is this for euery troblyd
conſciens to undreſtond althowgh it
be unworthi of remiſſion of ſinne for
the gratnys therof: yet for the prayer
of Chriſt he ſhall not be a caſt away ſo
that he belyue. as Chriſt ſaid, he praid
not only for his Apoſtelles but alſo
for as many as ſhuld beliue his word
till the woroldes end, as many as wilbe

goſpellers as the Ioue the goſpel ād
there awne ſaluacion let them not daily
and play with it as thowgh god were
à babe to be pleacid with à figg for
ſyn let hym thynk upon the moſt uile
and tyrannous deathe of hym that only
was able to clenſe us from ſin̄e and
from hens beware of ſinne it ſuffycit
as Paule ſaythe that before we knew
the truith to lyue want only. 1. Cor. 6.
         
         
            Caput X. Of this verite and truit
that the goſpell reachith us only
to be ſanctfiied in the blud of
Chriſt is confutyd the blaſpemus
pryde of the Biſhope
of Rome.
            THat namith hīſelfe the moſt holy
father and takith upō him to ſanctifie
all other men of therth as Godes
uicar and leaue tenent. to abſolue
à poena & à culpa, to pull out of hel ād

ſend to heuen with his pardons Maſſes
and other abhominations where
as Chriſt only and ſoly dooth ſanctifice
as it apperyd Ioan. 17. lik wice by
the title that Pilate gaue him hanging
upon the croſſe. Withe theſe wordes
Ieſus Nazarenus rex Iudaeorū. This
title declarith him to be bothe Moſhia
he ſauior and Noſer the protector
and ſanctifier of his church as Math.
ſaith ca. 2. Nazareus uocabitur. This
office of Chriſt doth abrogate all other
thinges that mannes cōſtitutions
attribute ony holynis unto as be wychyd
water Candellis bowes or ony
ſouch Ethnick ſuperſticion. For only
Chriſt ſanctifieth and all holynis we
muſt attribut unto hym. As Iohan
ſayd, Ecce agnus dei, qui tollit peccata
mundi Iohan. 1. behold the lamme
of god. To ſaye deſtenyd and appoyntid
by god to take awai the ſinne of
the world and to ſanctifie his churche

althowgh baptiſme be à ſacramēt to
be receauid and honorable uſyd of all
mē yet it ſanctifiet noman, and ſouch
as attribut the remiſſion of ſinne unto
the externall ſigne dooth offend.
Iohan Matth. 3. preachid penitence in
the deſert and remiſſion of ſinne in
Chriſt, ſouch as confeſſid ther fawtes
he markyd and declaryd thē to be of
Chriſtes churche ſo that externall baptiſme
was but an in auguracion or
externall cōſecraciō of theſe that firſt
belyuyd and were clenſid of there ſinne
as he declarith him ſelfe in the ſame
place: Ego (inquit) baptizo aqua. I
Chrtſtine withe water as towgh he
ſayd: My baptiſme makith Nomā the
Better, inwardly it changith noman.
But I call ād preach to the utward ere.
I exhort unto penence. And ſouch as
ſay they do repent and wold change
the old ſynfull lieff. I way ſhwith water,
he that inwardly clenſith is ſtronger

then I. his grace it is only that purifieth
the ſoule: I baptiſe in penence to
ſay into à new lieff. This new lieff cō
               mith
not untill ſouch time as Chriſt be
knowen and receauyd. now to put on
Chriſt, is to lyue à new lieff. ſouch as
be baptiſyd muſt remembre, that penenc
and fayth preſedyd this external
ſigne and in Chriſt the purgacion was
inwardely optaynyd before the externall
ſigne was yeuen. So that there is
too kindes of baptiſme and booth neceſſari:
the one interiour whiche is the
clenſing of the hart, the drawyng of
the father the operacion of the holy
gooſt and this baptiſme is in manwhē
he belyuith and truſtith that Chriſt is
the only auctor of his ſaluacion. thus
be the infantes examinyd conſerning
repentanc and fayth before they be
baptiſyd with water at the contemplacion
of the which faith God purchith
tha ſoule. then is the extereor ſigne addyd

not to purch the hart but to confirm
manifeſt and open unto the worold
that this chyld is godes and likwyce
baptiſme with the Repition of
the wordes is à uery ſacrament and ſigne
that the baptiſyd creature ſhuld
dy from ſynne all his lyffe, as Paule
wrytithe Roma. 6. likewyce noman
ſhuld condemne nor neglect this exterior
ſigne for the commaundementes
ſake: thowghe it haue no pore to purche
from ſinne yeat it confirmith the
purgation of ſinne and the Act of it
ſelf pleaſith god, for becauſe the receauers
therof obey the will of his commaundement.
Like as the Kynges maieſtie
that now is: immediatly aſter the
deathe of his father was the trewe and
legittyme Kyng of Inglond, right heyre
unto the crowne and receauid his
coronacion not to make hym ſelf there
by Kyng, but to manifeſt that the
Kyngdom apperteynid unto hym before,

he takith the crowne to confirm
his right and title, had all inglond
ſayd nay and by forſe contrary unto
godes lawes and manns lawes with
an exteriour ceremony and pompe
crownid ony other man he ſhuld haue
byn an adulterous and wronge
King, with all his ſolemnites and coronation.
Thowgh this ceremony cō
               firm
and manifeſt à King in his Kyngdom
yet it makith not à King
                  •
                But the
lawes of God and of the land that
yeuith by ſucceſſion the right of the
Kyngdom to the old Kynges firſt here
male in Englond an other Realmes
And the babe in the cradell hath as
godd right and cleame and is as trew
à Kyng in his cradell uncrownid as
his father was thowgh he reygnid à
crownid Kyng xl. yers, and this right
of the babe ſhuld be defendid and manifeſtid
not only by the ceremony of
coronation, but with all obediēce and

trew ſubiection. So is it in the church
of Chriſt, man is made the brother of
Chriſt and heyre of eternall lief by godes
only mercye receuid by faythe before
he receaue ony ceremony to confirm
and manifeſt opēly his right and
title he ſayth he belyuith in the father
the ſon and the holi goſt and beliuith
he ſaith the remiſſion of ſinne. Dooth
not only deny the deuill the worold
and ſinne but ſayth he will for ſake
hym for euer and ſerue his maſter the
lord of uertewe Kyng of heuen and
Erth. thus aſſurid of god and clenſid
from ſinne in Chriſt. He hathe the lyuerye
of god yeuen unto hym, baptiſme
the which no Chriſtiane ſhuld neglect,
and yet not attribut his ſanctification
unto the externall ſigne, as the
Kynges maieſtie may not attribut his
right unto the crowne but unto god
and ūto his father who hathe not onli
yeuen hym grace to be born into the

world. but alſo to gouern as à kyng in
the worold, who is right and Title the
crowne cōfirmyth and ſhewithe the
ſame unto all the worold. Where as
this right by God and naturall ſucceſſion
preſedith not: the coronacion, the
ceremony auaylith nothing à treatur
may receaue the crowne and yet trew
kyng nothing the rather, ſo an Hypocrite
and infidell may reeeue the externall
ſigne of baptiſme and yet, no chriſtiane
man nothing the rather as Simon
Magus and other. Sacramentes
muſt be uſid holyly, and yet not to haue
the office of Chriſt addid unto thē.
ſoly it is his office to ſanctifie ād purch
from ſinne. Itak nothing from the ſacramentes
but honor them and extolle
them in all thinges as they be worthy
How be it not to mouch. I call à ſacrament,
à ceremony inſtitutyd in the
law of God, to this end that it ſhuld
be à teſtimonye of Godes promiſſe un

ro all ſouch as belyue and ſignes of godes
godwill and fauor towardes us: as
Paule ſaythe that Abraham receauid
à teſtimonye, by the which God teſtified
that he was receauyd into grace,
Rom. 4. And as the promys of God
the remiſſion of ſinne is receauyd by
fayth, ſo muſt theſe Sacramentes that
be ſignes tokēs and teſtimonijs of the
promeſſe: be receauid in fayth. thus by
Chriſt wear ſanctified only. And as
Peter ſayth, the people choſen, à pryncly
priſhed à holy people and peculier
nacion to declare the pore of hym
that hathe callid us frow the darkenis
of errour and ſinne into his wounder
full light. theſe wordes declare the maner
how wear ſanctified, and what
our office is affter we be ſanctified: to
preach the pore of hym that hathe callid
us from the darknys of ſinne as it
is wroten Eſa. 43. Populum iſtum for
maui mihi ut laudē meam annunciet.

and likwyce ca. 66. the Prophetes and
Apoſtelles dooth uſe many times this
word: annunciare, pro laudare & gratias
agere ſo doth Paule 1. Cor. 11. Mortem
domini annunciabitis donec ueniat
ye ſhall ſhew the deathe of the
lord untill he com, id eſt, ye ſhall celebrat
the death of Chriſt with all preſes
and yeuing of thankes: ſouche
as be ſanctified by Chriſte muſt lyue
an honeſt and holy lief or elſe his ſanctification
auaylith not, as god for ſoke

he do us, they were electyd to be his
people with this condition ſi audiendo

that fauoryd not the Iſraelites but toke
cruell uengēce upon them becauſe
they walkid not in there uocatiō will
do and dooth dayly the ſame unto us,
Rom. 11. Therfore one of theſe too we

muſt nedes do that ſay we be iuſtified
and ſanctified in Chriſt, ether from
the botom of our hartes amend, or elſe
be eternally looſt with all our goſtelie
knolege for the ax is put to the rote of
the tre. So far is the malice of man procedid,
that the Ire of god can be nolenger
differyd: a great tyme hath the goſpell
byn knowen of many men. Yet
the lief of the goſpell as new to ſyk, as
thowgh it were but now begon therfore
ſee we how God beginnyth againe
to permit the darkenys of errour to
ouer whylme the worold, ſouch blindenis
euer folowith the contempt of
godes word, and the unthankfull receuing
therof. Tberfore as we be ſanctified
by Chriſt, ſo let us bare hym and
ſanctifie hym in our breſtes or elſe we
peryſhe, Ro. 6. for fayth intendith and
allways makyth haſt unto this porte
as Paule ſaith. Tit. 2, ut ſancte, iuſte ac
pie uiuamus: men knowith not what

the goſpell is, they rede it as they reade
beuis of hāptō, or the geſtes of Robin
hode. If they may know what the
ſcripture ſayth they iudge it ſufficiēt,
wher as it is cleane cōtrary men ſhuld
not only reade the ſcripture to be wyſer
but to be better we bare the name
of Chriſt, and confeſſe him We muſt
therfore be thoſe perſones in who is

or elſe we blaſpheme our maſter wois
name we bare Ro. 6. 13. becauſe after
baptiſme we ſhuld lyue à modeſt and
remperat lief, Chriſt departid into the
deſert and faſtid. Making this anſwer
unto the deuill. Non in ſolo pane uinit
homo, man is not creatyd to the fond
pleaſures of the worold, but to regard
what the will of god requirith.
They deceaue them ſelfes that truſt to

not. Faythe is matres in the ſoule
of the Chriſtiane and entertaynithe

no ſouch ſeruantes as be adulterours
Thyffes ſlaūderours dronkerdes. Couetous

            Caput XI.
            AS the ſcripture teachīte Chriſt to
be the ueri trew priſt ād biſhope
the church, prayth for the churche, ſatisfieth
the Ire of god for the ſinne of
the church and only ſanctifieth the
churche. So doothe it proue Chriſt to
be the Kyng Emperour and protector
of the churche. And that by thoffice
and property of à kyng that defendithe
his ſubiectes, not only by his
godly lawes, but alſo by forſe and ciuile
reſiſtance. As the Ennymies of
his commune wealthe ſhall miniſtre

               mune
wealthe is preſeruid as the ſcripture
teachith, princes Chriſtenid and
Ethnikes. Ariſtotelle in his politikes.
Iuſtiniane in the proeme of his inſtitutions.
The ſcripture euery where. Pharo
that would this churche of god and
commune wealth of the Iſraelites to
be deſtroid, was looſt and all his Armie
in the ſee. the idolaters that would
mak the cōmune wealthe of Chriſtes
churche one with the cōmune wealth
of Egypt were deſtroyd, ſouche as Rebellid:
Koreh and Rubinites agaynſt
the gouenrs of godes churche Moſes

artillyrie of godes ire, all the princes
and nations that poſſeſſid the land of
Chanaan, god deſtroyed to ſet his cō
               mune
wealthe in an order. In the later
dayes when the kyng of this commune
wealthe ſhuld be born the Angell
declaryd unto the bleſſid uirgine of

what puiſſance and poure this Kyngdom
of Chriſt ſhuld be. Regnabit inquit,
in domo Iacob in aeternū, & regni
eius nō erit finis, Lu. 1. althow now the
cōmūe wealth of the churche hath no
certayne place apointid where it ſhall
remayne. as it was appointid in thold
law: yet certayne we be that this kingdon
of Chriſt remaynith upon the erthe
and ſhall do till the erthe be burnyd,
Matth. 16. 28. 1 Corint. 15. How be
it as Chriſt wan and optaynyd this
kyngdon in the later days with out
ſhyld or ſpere ſo doothe he preſerue
it with his holy ſprit and not will carnall
wepynes as Chriſt ſayed unto Pilate
Ioan. 18. Regnum meum, non eſt
de hoc mūdo, Menyng that he would
not raygne in this worold as aprynce
of this worold with pompe and pryde:
but defend his people with his holy
ſprit, that the deuill nether the worold
ſhuld not breake there pacïence

thowghe many afflictions and ſorowes
ſhuld fyght againſt them for the
truithes ſake. Chriſt doothe not deny
to be the kyng of the worold Before
Pilate. But that he ment not to raigne
woroldlye to the hindreaunc and defacyng
of temperours dignite and title
as the Iewes falſly accuſid hym as
Cirillus libr. 12. capit. 10. in Iohannem
ſayth. and ſo is the mind of ſaynct Auguſtine
in the ſame place. This kyngdom
is ſpirituall: Chriſt ſitting at the
right hand of God the father, praithe
for us, yeuithe us remiſſiō of ſin̄e and
the holy gooſt to fight and ouercom
the worold Hathe leffte here in the
churche his goſpell thonly wepyn to
fight with all for the tyme of this mortall
liefe Ioan. 17. Where he definithe
lyffe euerlaſting to be the knolege of
god. So doth Paule Ro. 8. proue this
kyngdom to be ſpirituall. And that
concerning the body it apperith that

Chriſt defendith not his people becauſe
they liue in ſouch diſdayne and
aduerſite: but here after it ſhall appere
as Paule ſayth Col. 3. And Ioan. 1. Io. 3.
Nunc filij dei ſumus, ſed nondum manifeſtum
eſt quales erimus. This kingdom
ſhalbe euer perſequutid till the
woroldes end Pſal. 2. 115. 71. Eſay the
prophet deſcribid the churche of this
preſent lief ſayng. Dabit uobis dominus
panem arctū, & aquam exiguam
& non auferet à te ultra doctorem tuū
cap. 30. thus the church ſhall remayne
but alwayes in affliction. I know ſouche
as fauorith not the truith will interpretat
my wordes that I condemne
all princes and Kynges as Ennymies
of the goſpell becauſe they peaceable
enyoi there kingdōes: ſo I wiſhe thē allwaies
ſo to do with harti praier to the
glory god. But of this one thing I will
aſſure euery prince of the worold the
more ſyncere he is in the cauſe of god

the more ſhalbe his croſſe. I report me
unto the Kynges maieſtye that ded is
whiche at the fyrſt brount as ſone as
he toke godes cauſe in hand, that Leopard
and dragon of Rome: did not only
ſolicitat thole forene worold agaiſt
him, but alſo he ſuffryd ſouch an ungodly
and deteſtable inſurrection of
his papyſhe ſubiectes and other more
croſſes that neuer ſhuld haue ben mouyd,
had he not unquietid the beſt of
her reſt that ſate aboue his maieſti and
God alſo, in this awne Realme. they
be flaterers of prynces that ſay euerything
may be rulyd with eaſe. they cō
conſider not what an Ennymye of godes
order the deuill is: that would not
only the goſpell of truith to be appreſſid,
but alſo euery prince that ſtudithe
the preferment and ſetting fortb of godes
word: the deuill neuer ſeaſith to
moleſt and unquiet euery Godly polytyke
and commune wealthe where

there no ſcriptur deuine to detect thart
of the deuyll Ariſtotile in the 5. book
of his politykes were ſufficient to manifeſt
the deuille ennymyte agaynſt
all comme wealthes. farther the nature
of man is infyrm and fare unable to
ſuſtayne the offyce of ony uocaciō be
it polliticall, Eccleſiaſticall, or domeſticall
with out à ſinguler ayde of god
Weſe be ſaul that noble man who in
the begynning of his raygne dyd many
noble actes, yet the deuill gote the
uictori in the end: his ſucceſſor Dauid
was lik wyce ſo intanglid in the ſnares
of the deuill, that with mouche paine
he could quit hym ſelf from the
wycchyd coupe that the deuill had
ons browght hym god Luk of: how
be it god defendid booth him and his
kyngdom ſo that, not only the preachers
but alſo he himſelf tawght the
word of god unto the people as he
had promiſid Pſal. 6. 50. god preſeruithe

aboue humane reaſon his miniſtres
as he dyd Iacob from the handes
of Eſau. Dauid ffrom Saul, daniell
from the lyons, and Paule in the ſhippe
where as no humane hope of ſaluacion
was at all but onli the protection
of god. Thoſe examples declare that
he dooth defend his people agaynſt
all the worold by his mighr poore.
Likewyce he gouernith this churche
with his only lawes, and would his
ſubiectes to know hym: to honor him
and to obey him as he hathe cōmaundid
in his lawe Paule expreſſith this
law Roma. 1. Euangelium uirtus dei
eſt in ſalutem omni credendi. Marci
ultimo, Predicate Euangelium omni
creaturae. The only law wherūto this
congregation is bound is the goſpell,
as Chriſt ſaith Io. 14. Spiritus ſanctus
docebit uos omnia, & rediget uobis in
memoriam, omnia quae ego dixi uobis.
Here Chriſt byndith the Apoſtelles

and all the churche unto the thynges
that he had tawght them. This cō
               mune
wealthe of the trew churche is
knowyn by theſe too Markes the pure
preaching of the goſpell and the
ringht uſe of the ſacramētes thus prouith
Paule Epheſios 2. that the churche
is bound unto the word of god ſuper
fundamentum Apoſtolorum &
prophetarum extructi eſtis. Likwyſe
Eſa. 59. Spiritus meus qui eſt in te, &
uerba mea quae poſui in ore tuo, nō recedent
ab ore tuo, nec ab ore ſeminis
tui in aeternum. Of the right uſe of ſacramentes
it is tawght 1. Cor. 11. Mar.
ult. Luce ult. & Mat. ult. ſouche as teachith
people to know the churche by
theſe ſignes The traditions of men,
and the ſucceffion of biſhopes teache
wrong. Thoſe too falſe opinions hathe
yeuen unto the ſucceſſion of biſhopes
pore to interpretat the ſcripture,
and pore to mak ſouche lawes in

the church as it pleacid them. There is
nomā hath pore to interpretat the ſcripture
god for the preſeruacion of his
churche doothe yeue unto certayne
perſones the giffte and knolege to opē
the ſcripture. But that yeſt is no pore
bound to ony order ſucceſſion of biſhopes
or title of dignite. Te princes of
the Erth dooth yeue allwayes ſouche
pore of ciuile Iuſtice by ſucceſſion, as
one is cheyffe iuſtice for the tyme of
his office to do euery thing appettayning
unto the ſame, ſo hath allwayes
his ſucceſſor the like. God hathe yeuē
the ciuile magiſtrates poure and auctorite
to make ſouche lawes for the
cōmune wealthe as ſhalbe agreable
withe reaſon and not agaynſt godes
lawe and like wyce pore to interpretat
the ſame lawes. But this is not to
be admittid in the church unto whom
god hathe yeuen the goſpell, and inter
pretatyd the ſame by his only ſonne:

tawght the mening and cōtentes therof
himſelfe. To know god, and his
ire agaynſt ſinne, the greatnis of ſinne
the iuſtice yeuen in Chriſt, the fere of
god. The faith in his promiſes, the perſequution
of his membres. The ayed
and helpe of god in aduerſite, the reſurrexion
of the ded. Where and
what the trew church is of Euerlaſting
lief. Of the too natures in Chtiſt
of the father the ſonne, and the holy
goſt. Theſe be contentes of the law
wher unto god hath bound his churche
and commandyd here to hyre his
ſonne conſerning the interpretation
of theſe poyntes. And at the commandement
of Chriſt the Apoſtelles were
ſent to preache theſe uerites in the
ſprit of god. It is therfore neceſſary to
retayne in the churche the doctrine yeuē
unto us by the Apoſtelles, ād to be
the diſciples of there doctrine: and not
to fayne interpretations of our awne

hedes cōtrari unto there doctrine. Souche
as will be the mēbres of this churche
muſt be adiſciple of the goſpell ād
lern in fere and humblenys of ſprit
tharticles of our religion as they be
tawght there: and not ſtand unto the
iudgēt of ony man what ſo euer hebe
towghe he ſay truithe: for his truithe
is nothing except thauctorite of Godes
worde conteyne the ſayd truithe.
it is a great confirmacion of our faythe
when we ſee ſouche as were godly
perſones before us interpretat the
ſcripture and uſe the Sacramentes as
we doo. As when the hereſye of ſemo
ſatenus troblid the Chriſtiāe brothers
that ſayd this word, uerbum in Iohan
In principio erat uerbum, did not
ſignifie ony perſon: nor ſubſtaynce deuyne.
They were confyrmid by the te
teſtimony of Ireneus that hard Policar
pus Iohan the Euangeliſt Diſciple interpretat
uerbū in the goſpell for the

ſane of God ſecond perſon in Trinite.
thowghe we be bound to hire the
churche to ſay the trew and fayhfull
preachers of Godes worde as was in
this caſe Policarpus and Ireneus. Not
with ſtōding our faithe: Is not grown
dyd upon the authorite of the churche.
But in and upon the uoyce of the
goſpell. we pray and inuocat the ſon̄e
of God ſecond perſon in Trinite. Becauſe
the ſcripture prouithe him to be
god, Deus erat uerbū. Alſo: Pater meus

ſine me nihil poteſtis facere. Item domine
Ieſu accipe ſpiritum meum. The
aduerſarijs of the truithe defend many
à falſe errour under the Name of
the holy churche: therfore thefe treaſons
and ſecreat conſpiriſis muſt be taken
hed of. And when the churche is
Namyd, diligently to conſider when
the articles, thei wold defend: were acceptid
of the churche: by whom, and

who was thauctor of them leaue not
till the mater be brought unto the firſt
originall and moſt perfet churche of
the Apoſteles if thow find by there
wrytinges that there churche uſid, the
thing that the preachet would proue
then accept it or elſe not be not amaſid
thow the ſpeake of neuer many yers
nor name neuer ſo many doctors,
Chriſt and his Apoſteles be graunt fathers
in ayge to the doctors and maſters
in lerning, repoſe thy ſelfe only
the churche that thei haue tawght the
by the ſcripture: fere nether of the ordinary
pore or ſucceſſion of biſhopes
ner of the greater part. For if ether the
auctorite of biſhopes or the greater
part ſhuld haue pore to interpretat
the ſcripture, the ſentence of the phariſes,
ſhuld haue byn preferrid before
the ſentence of Zacharie, Simion, Elizabet
or the blyſſid uirgine conſider
that many time the trew churche is

but à ſmale cōgregation as Eſay ſaith
Niſi deus reliquiſſet nobis ſemen, ſicut
Sodoma eſſemus. Therfore is not
the interpretation of the ſcripture obligatid
unto an ordinarie pore ner the
moſt part. As Noe Abraam, Moſes,
Samuel, Dauid and Chriſtes time teſtifieth.
Beware of decete when thow he
riſt the name of the churche. The uerite
is then aſſaultyd they call the churche
of the deuill, the holy churche many
times. As Korahe and the reſt of
the people ſayd unto Moſes many
times, why haue ye deceauid the
people of god and browght them out
of Egypt. They were the churche of
god nothīg the rather thowghe it was
pentyd with this holy title, but the
church of the deuill and à congregation
of rebellious and ſeditious perſones
as god declaryd both by word ād
fact. Moſes callid not thē the churche
of god but the church of Korahe, not

the people of god but rebellions and
godes Ennymies as god declarid thē
to be by his cruell reuenging of them
ſo many times had the mooſt part
byn preferrid thē the truithe had byn
confundid and Moſes and Aron put
to deathe. Remembre Chriſtiane reader
that the yeſte of interpretation of
the ſcripture is the light of the holy
goſt yeuen unto the humble and penitent
perſon that ſekethe it only to honor
god, and not unto thoſe perſones
that accleme it by title or place by cauſe
he his à biſhope, or folowid by ſucceſſion
Peter or Paule. Examine there
lawes by the ſcripture and then ſhalte
thow perceaue they be the Ennymyes
of Chriſtes churche and the uery
churche of Korahe. Remembre the
refore to examine all kind of doctrine
by the word of god. For ſouch as preache
it aright hathe there infirmites
and ignorancy, they may depart from

the truithe: or elſe buld ſome ſuperſtition
and falſe doctrine, upon the goſpell
of Chriſt ſuperſtitiō is to be auoy
did falſe doctrine to be abhorrid who
ſo euer be thauctor ther of prince magiſtrate
or biſhope. As the Apoſtelis
made anſwer Acto. 5. Oportet magis
obedire deo quā hominibus. The ſuperiour
poure hath autorite and maye
make what lawes the liſt for the wealthe
and preſeruation of there ſubiectes
ſo it repugnat the law of nature
nor the law of god but as touching
the churche of Chriſt whiche gouernith
the ſoule of man only the law of
god muſt be obedied. The ceremonies
ordeinid for à godd order to be obſeruid
in the churche ſhuld not be neglectid
as the aſſemblaūs of people in
the ſabboth day and other feſtes wherin
the word of god is preachid and
he ſacramentes rightly miniſtrid. But

                  •
               eſe ceremonies that partly ſuperſticion,

partly auaryce partly tyranny
hath browght into the church ar to be
eſchuyed, as the ſayng of priuat maſſes
bleſſing of water, bowgh bread,
bell or candell with ſouch like. As for
the prayng unto dead ſaynctes or to
haue there imagis in te churche it is
not à ceremony mater. But uery playne
and manifeſt Idolatrie, cōtrary ūto
the expreſſe word of god who forbid
dith to make ony ymagie and he that
prayth unto God in the name of ony
ded ſaynct is an Ethnick and knowith
not god. For he folowith his
imagination and not the word of god
who teachith and commaundith that
we ſhuld booth know and pray unto
him in his ſonnes name Ioan. 14. the
neglecting of this commaundement
deſeruith eternall paynes. Souch as
hath à knolege of Chriſt from henſforthe
let them yeue him his right honor
and leaue this Idolatrie and ſuperſticion.

Conſidering that with great
payne he wan the churche out of the
handes of the deuill defendith it with
his holy ſprit and gouernith it with
the lawes of his only word. And conſider
whether theſe iniuries, blaſphemis,
troble, unquietnis and deſtruction
of godes people by the law of the
biſhopes be to be permittid thowghe
they cry till they be horſe agaīe the holy
churche the holi churche. Were the
like troble in ony realme among the
kynges ſubiectes by the occacion and
abuſe of the kynges maieſtis lawes,
doutles could they not ſhew under
the kynges ſeale there law to be of auctorite.
they ſhuld as right is ſonne be
put to ſilence, and there adulterous
lawes and ſophiſticall gloſſes remouid
out of the way thus I know that
Chriſt knew beſt all the hiſtories of
the old lawe, was the preſent teacher
himſelff of all uerite and mooſt wyſe

to prouide for the churche ſouch lawes
as ſhuld preſerue it in his abſens.
            NOw that we know what Chriſte,
and his office is in the churche
of god. It is likewyce neceſſary for
euery man that is Amembre of this
churche to know what manne is, and
his office towardes Chriſt for as god
hath bound hymſelfe by his promes
to be our god and helper for Chriſt, ſo
hathe he bound man by his cōmaundement
to be his ſeruāt and in his worde
to folow Chriſt and in Chriſt god
for the commaundementes ſake untill
ſouche tyme as thend wherfore
man was made be optaynid, whiche
is eternall foelicite and man reſtoryd

therof where withe all the hole maſſe

had byn in all thinges, like unto

If the ſcripture of god and wrytinges

my labores ſhall litle auayle I know

to ſarche the glory of god and ſaluacion

the only way ther unto is to Examin

Marke the trauyce and pley
betwene the law of God, and the conſcience
of Paule and ſe how he yeuythe
thankes unto his maſter the law
and ꝓclemit he it to be à ſpiritual ād holy

thyng, as à light or torche to ſhew
man his ffylthy and ſtynking nature:
ſayng lex ſpiritualis eſt: at ego carnalis
ſum, uenditus ſub peccatū, Abondman
of ſinne, and trayture of god. Here
thow ſeyſt godd reader what amiſerable
wrecche man is, and how man
may know his miſeri by the law.
How be it thowghe we rede it many
times we be nether the wyſer, nether
the better, we be not tawght à dele
bi this miſtres the law, ſhe cānot make
us good ſcolers we daly and play
ſo withe the worold, we lyue in ſouche
ſecurite and eaſe, that ſay ſhe
what ſhe liſt we torn the deffe eare
and will not hyre: therfore to make
man to know himſelfe god ſentithe
an other myſtres to ſcole man, ſcilicet
aduerſite, then we begyn to undreſtond
the law of god that diſſwadithe
from ſinne, and we then know oure
miſery. As Dauid Criethe that he is

notable to bare the burdon of ſinne
if the lord execute iuſtice as the greatnis
therof meritithe, Si iniquitates obſeruaueris
dn̄e, ꝗs ſuſtinebit? Pſal. 130.
Dauid when he felt the paynes of his
adultery, the deathe of his chyldre the
conſpyricie of Abſolon, the uiciating
of his wiues, exile and banyſhement
and ſouche other calamites. In this ſcole
of miſery he lernyd this uerſe. Who
can ſuſteine the ire of god? Now thowghe
theſe temporall paynes be more
then man cā ſupport: they be but ſport
and dalyance in reſpect of the paynes
aeternall: How be it man may lern by
them how mouche God is diſpleacyd
withe ſinne and know himſelfe to be
as he is, à uile peace of erthe, withe all
his pryd and pompe. And A rebellion
unto his maker as no creatur els is ſauyng
the deuyll, and he: this innword
and ſecreatyle. Rebellion of the hart,
blindnis of the inthintēdemēt, and frawardnys

of will is dayly augmentid
by the malice of the deuill and oure awne
negligence that regardithe not
what the law teachithe God reguyrithe
of man. Becauſe the goſpell teachithe
we ar only ſauyd by the mercye of
God, for the merites of Chriſt oure
goſpellers hathe ſet all at libertye, and
carith not at all of ſouche liefe as ſhuld
and awght to folow eueri iuſtified mā

for there is no diſcipline and ponyſhment
for ſinne, and wher ſo euer the

as à kynges armye towghthe hartes

magiſtrates and preachers preſeruethe

with out thexcommunication of ſouche
as openly offend the deuine maieſti
of god and his word for by this meanes
the ſinner is tawght by the ſcripture
to know hīſelfe. 1. Cor. 5. cōgregatis
uobis & meo ſpiritu, una cū poteſtate
domini noſtri Ieſu Chriſti, ut is
qui hoc patrauit tradatur ſathanae ad
interitum carnis, ut ſpiritus ſaluus ſit
in die domini noſtri Ieſu Chriſti. God
would not only the fideles, but alſo
the infideles to be kept `in an order by
the diſcipline of the law, as Paule ſaithe,
Lex eſt iniuſtis poſita lik wyce
Deut. 19. Auferes malum, ut audientes
reliqui timorem habeant, non miſeriaris
eius. This politicall and ciuile
uſe of the law teachith man to know
his faultes and this diſcipline of the
law exterior and ciuile is neceſſary
for man for diuerſe cauſes. ffyrſt to declare
our obedience unto god. Then
to auoyed the puniſhement that allwaies

god, or elſe the magiſtrat reuengithe
the tranſgreſſion. Thyrdly becauſe
of apuplike peace in euery commune
wealthe that thone ſhuld not
do iniuries to the other, nether in body,
ner in godes. There is yet an other
cauſe why this diſcipline of the law is
neceſſary whiche few men regard
Paule ſaithe that it is à ſcole myſtres.
Pedagogia unto Chriſt becauſe ſouche
as leuithe not to ſinne and to do
the thing contrary unto the expreſſe
word of god: to thoſe Chriſt is not
profetable this uſe teachite Paule 1.
Cor. 6. Fornicatores Idolatre, adulteri
&c. regnum dei nō poſſidebunt. And
ſo ſaith Iohan, Omnis qui peccat exdiabolo
eſt. He that knowithe himſelfe
muſt refrayne from doing of yle.
Hyre the goſpel: and lern the goſpell:
that the ſprit of god may be efficatious
in hym whiche cānot be as long
as he hathe à purpoſe to continew in

doing of yle. Ezechiel ſpekyth of this
uſe ciuile and politike of the law: and
likwyce of the ſecond uſe therof whiche
is as I ſayd before to ſhew man his
ſinne, to accuſe man before God, to fere
hym and to damme man playnly capit.
33, Viuo ego nolo mortem peccatoris: ſed
ut uiuat, & conuertatur. Theſe
wordes declare that as God would
not the death of à ſinner, ſo he requirythe the ſinner to ceaſe from doyng of
yle and to be conuertyd unto uertew.
as for the ſecōd uſe of the law whiche
is to declare what ſinne is I ſhewid before
that it manifeſtith the greatnys
and uilnys there of as Paule writithe,
it damnith ſynne and deliuerythe not
from ſinne: per legem (inquit) cognitio
peccati. Lex iram efficit: per legem
peccatum fit excellenter reum. Ro. 7,
aculeus mortis peccatū, uirtus autem
peccati lex eſt. 1. Cor. 15. In men that be
addict unto the pleaſure of this worold

the law hath not this uſe, ſay the
preacher what he liſt, let the word of
God thretyne deathe eternall for ſin̄e
it auaylithe not, he thinkithe that God
is à ſlepe ād will at laſt be pleacid with
afygg for ſinne we ſhall find the contrary
to oure great payne, as other hathe
before oure tyme, that would not
belyue the word: till the felt the uengēce
and puniſhment of god, as Caim
the drownyd world with the flud. the
burning of Sodoma with other. It is
agreat and horrible offence to hide or
extenuat the iudgment of god againſt
ſinne, and the uoyce of the law that cō
               demnit
the ſame. God willith his pleaſure
to be knowyn openly Hier. 1. Eccededi
uerba mea in ore tuo: Ecce conſtitui
te ſuper gentes ut euellas & deſtruas.
This uſe and office of the law
none felithe nether perceuithe as wel
as ſouche as be godes frendes. Adam,
Abraam, Iacob, Dauid, Ezechias &c.

Dauid ſayde that the fere of godes didiſpleaſure
and Ire was no leſſe payne
unto him, then thowgh the fyrſe lyon
had rent and diſmembrid his body in
peces: ſicut Leo contriuit omnia oſſa
mea Pſalm. 22. So ſaithe Paule, O infelix
ego homo quis me eripiet ab hoc
corpore morti obnoxio. He that befote
ſaide, Ego aliquando uiuebam ſine
lege, id eſt, fui ſecurus, non ſentiens irā
dei. Now conuertid from à Phariſie
to be and Apoſtell, and browght to à
knolege of hymſelfe. He confeſſythe
his inbecillite and faultes and ſaith.
Noui quod non habitet in me, hoc eſt
in carne mea bonum, yet Paule confeſſith
that the law makyth us not à ferd
to be damnyd becauſe we cannot ſatisfie
it: but that we ſhuld com to Chriſt
withe theſe confortabe wordes. Concluſit
omnes ſub peccato ut omnium
miſeratur Agreat cōſolation for euery
troblyd conſcience: thus man may

know hymſelfe to be as he is à uery
wrecchid and damnable creature were
not the uertew of Chriſtes deathe.
         
         
            Caput XIII.
            WHat thoffice of à iuſtified man

Not uniuſtly and doing wronges

Likewyce with an other argument, à

the ſon̄e of god gaue nether gold nor
ſyluer for our purgacion but his awnebody
and precions bludd: it is therfore
an unwourthie thing and not becōming
à Chriſtiane man that by fay
the hathe receuid this purgation to lyue
à uitious and ungodli liefe. But we
ſhuld be an holy people and folowers
of good workes. There is a great uertew
in this word zeloten it is not, ſufficient

to worke well: Except the iuſtified
man with agodly zeale and ardent
deſire folow this godd worke be
gon. Therefore Paule ſaithe zelotē calō
ergō etnō operatorē bonorū operū
wherby we know that all thowgh we
be delyuerid frō the malediction, courſe
and dānation of the law (ſo that we
reteyne à trew faythe and withe confidence
in Chriſt, repugne ſinne, and ouer
com the terrours therof) yet ar we
boūd to the obedience of the law, whiche
is Godes will to kepe us from lyuyng
ille, and the more the iuſtified
man beholdithe the law the more increſithe
the knolege of ſinne, the more
he beholdithe the mercy of God in
Chriſt, the more is his fay the increſith.
the lawis alſo neceſſarie for theiuſtified
mā to teache hī withewhat workes he
ſhuld exetciſe his faythe withe all, and
obediēce ūto God. We may not choſe
workes of our awne wyſdom to ſerue

withe all. But would us to be gouernyd
by his word as Dauid ſaythe: Lucerna
pedibus meis uerbum tuum.
Alſo: Fruſtra me colunt, mandatis hominum.
The wyſdom of man not gouernyd
by the word of God doothe
ſone erre. It is caryd for the moſt part
withe affections and choſithe the workes
that be contrary to the law of god.
There fore this is trew, that the ordinance
of God ſtill remanithe in the iuſtified
man immutable, that he muſt
obey the law, and ſerue in his uocacion
according to the ſcripture, that the
exterior factes may bare teſtimonye
of the inward reconciliacion. The ſcripture
is more diligent and more ample
in teaching, the Chriſtiane iuſtified
man the obedience unto God and uertews
liefe, then it is to ſhew us our ſaluacion
in Chriſt: for this purpoſe only
that we ſhuld not: by oure licētious
liberty receaue the grace of god inuayne

it is more hard for mā to know the
goſpell thē to folow the liefe of the goſpell,
an other mā may preache Chriſt,
but the auditour muſt folow Chriſt,
the ſciens of the ſcripture is practiue
and not ſpeculatiue, it requirithe à doer,
and not à speaker only. there be many
that diſſemblith faythe, and hathe
à certayne ſhew of religion when indede
in the inward man is nofaithe at
all: let euery man therfore ſarche his awne
conſcience withe what faithe he
is indued and remembre that Chriſt
ſayd it is à ſtrayght waye and narow,
that ledithe to liefe Math. 7. and but à
few that walkithe there in. therfore
oure only remedye is to pray
for grace and amend.
