and ſcoldinge about wordes. The olde teſtament is a boke wherin is written the lawe of god / & the dedes of them which fulfyll them / & of them alſo which fulfyll them nat.
               ¶ The newe Teſtament is a boke / wherin are conteyned the promyſes of god / & the dedes of them whiche beleue them / or beleue them nat.
               Euāgelion (that we call the goſpel) is a greke worde / & ſygnifyeth good mery / glad / & ioyfull tidynges / that maketh a mannes herte glad / & maketh him ſynge / daunce / & leape for ioye. As whā Dauid had killed Go lyath the giaūt / came glad tidinges vnto the iewes / that their fearfull & cruell enemy was ſlayne / & they delyuered out of all danger: for gladnes wherof they ſōge / daūſed & wer ioyfull. In lyke maner is the euangelion of god (which we cal goſpel & the new teſtamēt) ioyfull tidyngꝭ 
and as ſome ſaye: A good herynge publyſſhed by the apoſtels through oute all the worlde / of Chriſte the righte Dauyd / howe that he hathe fought with ſynne / with dethe / and the deuyll / and ouercome them.
               Whereby all men that were in bondage to ſynne wounded with dethe / ouercome of the Deuyll / are withoute their owne meryttes or deſeruynges / loſed / iuſtifyed / reſtored to lyfe / and ſaued / brought to lybertie and reconſyled vnto the fauoure of god and ſet at one with him agayne which tidynges as many as beleue laude / prayſe / and thanke god / are glad / ſynge / daunce for ioye.
               ¶ This Euangelyon or Goſpell (that is to ſaye / ſuche ioyfull tidynges) is called the newe Teſtament. Becauſe that as a mā whan he ſhal dye / appoynteth his goodes to be delte and diſtributed after his deth

amonge them whiche he nameth to be his heyres. Euyn ſo Chriſt before his deth commaunded and appoynted that ſuche Euangelyon / Goſpell or tidynges / ſhulde be declared throughoute all the worlde / and therwith to gyue vnto all that repent and beleue / all his goodes: that is to ſaye / his lyfe / wherewith he ſwalowed and deuoured vp deth his rightwyſneſſe / wherwith he banyſſhed ſynne: his ſaluacion / wherwith he ouercame eternall dampnacyon. Now can the wretched man (that knoweth him ſelfe to be wrapped in ſyn / and in daunger to dethe and Hell) here no more ioyouſe a thynge / than ſuche gladde and comfortable tidynges of Chriſt / ſo that he can nat but be gladde and laugh from the lowe bottome of his hert / if he beleue that the tidynges are trewe.
               
                  ¶ To ſtrength ſuch fayth with all / god promyſed this his euangelyon in the olde teſtameut by the prophetes (as Paule ſayth in the fyrſt chapiter vnto ye Romayns) Howe that he was choſen out to preche goddes Euangelion / whiche he before had promyſed by the prophetꝭ in the holy ſcriptures that treate of his ſōne which was borne of the ſede of Dauyd. In the thirde chapiter of Geneſis / god ſayth to the ſerpente: I wyll put hatered betwene the & the woman / betwene thy ſeede and her ſede: that ſelfe ſede ſhall treade thy heed vnder fote, Chriſt is the womans ſede / he it is that hath troden vnder fote the deuyls heede / that is to ſaye: ſynne / dethe / hell / and all his power. For without this ſede can no mā auoyde ſynne / deth / hell / and euerlaſtynge dampnacion. Agayne / Gene. xxii. God promyſed

He hath bleſſed al the worlde throughe the Goſpell. For where Chriſte is nat / there remayneth the curſe that fell on Adam / as ſone as he had ſynned / ſo that they are in bondage vnder the dampnacyon of ſynne / deth / & hell. Againſt this curſe bleſſeth nowe the goſpell all the worlde / in as moch as it cryeth openly vnto all that knowledge their ſynnes and repent / ſayenge: Who ſo euer beleueth on the ſede of Abraham ſhalbe bleſſed / that is / he ſhall be delyuered from ſynne / deth and hell / and ſhall hence forthe contynewe

The lawe (whoſe minyſter is Moſes) was gyuen to bringe vs vnto the knowledge of oure ſelues / that we myght thereby fele & perceyue what we are of nature, The law condemneth vs & all oure dedes / & is called of Paule (in the third cha. of the. ii. piſtle vnto the corinthians) the myniſtracyon of dethe. For it kylleth oure conſcyences and drweth vs to diſperacyon / in as moche as it requyreth of vs / that which is vnpoſſyble for our nature to do. It requyreth of vs the dedes of an hole man. It requyreth ꝑfet loue from the low bottom and grounde of the hert / as well in all thynges which we ſuffre as in tho thiges which we do.

As affermeth Paule / ſayeng: whiche loued vs in his beloued before the creatyon of the world. So that Chriſt bringeth the loue of god vnto vs / and nat oure owne holye workes.

In all my dedes I muſte haue the lawe before me to condempne myne vnꝑfytnes. For all that I do (be I neuer ſo parfyte) is yet dampnable ſynne / whan it is compared to the lawe / which requyreth the grounde and bottome of myne herte.

Fyrſt they which iuſtifye them ſelfe with outwarde dedes / in that they abſteyne outwardly from that whiche the lawe forbyddeth / and do outwardly that whiche the lawe commaundeth. They compare themſelues to open ſynners / and in reſpecte of them iuſtify thē ſelues / condempnynge the open ſynners. They ſet a vayle on Moſes face / & ſe nat howe the lawe requyreth loue frō the botthom of the hert / & that loue only is the fulfyllynge of the lawe. If they dyd they wolde nat condemne their neybours. Loue hydeth the multy

For whom I loue from the depe bothom & grounde of myne herte / him condempne I nat / neither reken his ſynnes / but ſuffre his wekeneſſe & infyrmyte / as a mother the wekeneſſe of her ſonne / vntyll he grow vp into a parfyte man. ¶ Thoſe alſo are diſceyued which without all feare of god gyue them ſelues vnto all manner vyces with full conſent / & full delectacion / hauynge no reſpect to the lawe of god (vnder whoſe vengeaunce they are locked vp in captiuytie) but ſaye: God is mercyfull / & Chriſt dyed for vs / ſuppoſynge that ſuch dremynge and ymaginacion is that fayth whiche is ſo greatly commended in holy ſcripture. Naye / that is nat fayth but rather a folyſſhe blynde opinyon / ſpringynge of their owne corrupt nature / and is nat gyuen them

               ¶ They that haue this right fayth conſente to the lawe that it is right wyſe & good / and iuſtifye god whiche made the lawe / and haue delectacyon in the lawe (natwithſtāding that they can nat fulfyll it as they wolde for their wekenes) & they abhorre what ſo euer the lawe forbyddeth / though they can nat alwayes

For the fleſſh hath no lē

ſurely in Jeſu Chriſt / he is aſſured and certifyed that Jeſu Chriſt is in him / & therfore he can be afrayde of nothynge / ſeynge that Jeſu Chriſt is puyſaunt & mighty / whiche hath vaynquyſſhed the worlde & all power contrary vnto the ſoule / in the which he dwelleth by his holy ſpyryte / ſo that nothynge can ceperate him from his ſouerayne welth / whiche is Jeſu Chriſt / which cōforteth him with his holy promyſes / which euery faythfull ought to haue contynually before him. And by this menes is the ſoule delyuered from the gret quakyng & tremblyng that he was in before the goſpell was preſēted vnto him / which drede the law brought him vnto / ſhewynge him that he had deſerued dampnacyon in the brekynge therof. But whan he hereth thoſe ſame glad tydīges / he hath an inwarde ioye in himſelfe

whiche no herte of man can thinke without that he haue proued it.
               For the more harder the condemnation is / & the more ſharpe the dethe is that foloweth it / & from the more greuouſneſſe that he is delyuered & brought to this bleſſednes and lyfe / which he neuer loked for / the more is his ioye gret, And therfore ye ſoule conſyderinge the excedyng goodnes that ye endles mercy that the father of heuen hath done for him / in gyuyng his ſon for him / ponderīge alſo the moſt ineſtimable ſwetneſſe of the moſt benige Jeſus / who hath ſpent & ſhed his blode for him takīg vpon him all his ſīnes / cancellyng and makyng voyde the oblygacion of deth in the which he was bonde / waſſhynge him pure & clene in his blode / baptiſynge him with ye holy ſpirite / the which of an ardent loue wolde voucheſafe to come downe &
