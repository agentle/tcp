                  Cum priuilegio Regiae Maiestatis.
               
               
                  
                  
                  To the right honorable Sir Francis Walsingham Knight, principall Secretarie to her excellent Maiestie, and one of her highnes priuie Counsell. I. C. wisheth prosperitie in this life, and life euerlasting in Christ our Sauiour.
                  
                     HOwsoeuer the abuse of Musike may be great, when it is made an instrument to feede vaine delightes, or to nourish and entertaine superstitious deuotion: yet the right vse thereof is commanded in singing Psalmes, and making melodie to God in our harts. Therefore (right honorable,) as by the grace of God I labour to auoide the former, so haue I been carefull in my profession to further the second. And hauing in this care set Six & Fiue parts vpon the tunes ordinarily sung to the Psalmes of Dauid, I was encouraged by some to publish them for the priuate vse and comfort of the godlie, in place of many other Songs neither tending to the praise of God, nor conteining any thing fit for Christian eares. VVhereunto when I had yelded, my desire was to dedicate those labours taken for the furtherance of godlie exercises,

to a Patrone of godlines, and a mainteiner of true religion. And among many such (whom the Lord increase, in all heauenly wisedom) I haue now a long time speciallie been deuote to your honour, as one most ioyfull to heare both of your singular zeale to the trueth, and of your manifold and honourable actions to aduance the same. Herein I may seeme bold in so simple a worke to craue your honorable protection, but my trust is, that the least things tending to the praise of God, and furtherance of pietie, are not litle to your honour: vpon which persuasion I rest, beseeching the Lord, to grant you increase of honour, and wisedom, and all other graces requisit for your honourable state in this life, and leading to an estate in the life to come, most honourable and euerlasting.
                  
                     
                        Your humblie at commandment. I. Cosyn.

                  To the right honorable Sir Francis Walsingham Knight, principall Secretarie to her excellent Maiestie, and one of her highnes priuie Counsell. I. C. wisheth prosperitie in this life, and life euerlasting in Christ our Sauiour.
                  
                     HOwsoeuer the abuse of Musike may be great, when it is made an instrument to feede vaine delightes, or to nourish and entertaine superstitious deuotion: yet the right vse thereof is commanded in singing Psalmes, and making melodie to God in our harts. Therefore (right honorable,) as by the grace of God I labour to auoide the former, so haue I been carefull in my profession to further the second. And hauing in this care set Six & Fiue parts vpon the tunes ordinarily sung to the Psalmes of Dauid, I was encouraged by some to publish them for the priuate vse and comfort of the godlie, in place of many other Songs neither tending to the praise of God, nor conteining any thing fit for Christian eares. VVhereunto when I had yelded, my desire was to dedicate those labours taken for the furtherance of godlie exercises▪
                     
to a Patrone of godlines, and a mainteiner of true religion. And among many such (whom the Lord increase, in all heauenly wisedom) I haue now a long time speciallie been deuote to your honour, as one most ioyfull to heare both of your singular zeale to the trueth, and of your manifold and honourable actions to aduance the same. Herein I may seeme bold in so simple a worke to craue your honorable protection, but my trust is, that the least things tending to the praise of God, and furtherance of pietie, are not litle to your honour: vpon which persuasion I rest, beseeching the Lord, to grant you increase of honour, and wisedom, and all other graces requisit for your honourable state in this life, and leading to an estate in the life to come, most honourable and euerlasting.
                  
                     
                        Your humblie at commandment. I. Cosyn.

                  To the right honorable Sir Francis Walsingham Knight, principall Secretarie to her excellent Maiestie, and one of her highnes priuie Counsell. I. C. wisheth prosperitie in this life, and life euerlasting in Christ our Sauiour.
                  
                     HOwsoeuer the abuse of Musike may be great, when it is made an instrument to feede vaine delightes, or to nourish and entertaine superstitious deuotion: yet the right vse thereof is commanded in singing Psalmes, and making melodie to God in our harts. Therefore (right honorable,) as by the grace of God I labour to auoide the former, so haue I been carefull in my profession to further the second. And hauing in this care set Six & Fiue parts vpon the tunes ordinarily sung to the Psalmes of Dauid, I was encouraged by some to publish them for the priuate vse and comfort of the godlie, in place of many other Songs neither tending to the praise of God, nor conteining any thing fit for Christian eares. VVhereunto when I had yelded, my desire was to dedicate those labours taken for the furtherance of godlie exercises,

to a Patrone of godlines, and a mainteiner of true religion. And among many such (whom the Lord increase, in all heauenly wisedom) I haue now a long time speciallie been deuote to your honour, as one most ioyfull to heare both of your singular zeale to the trueth, and of your manifold and honourable actions to aduance the same. Herein I may seeme bold in so simple a worke to craue your honorable protection, but my trust is, that the least things tending to the praise of God, and furtherance of pietie, are not litle to your honour: vpon which persuasion I rest, beseeching the Lord, to grant you increase of honour, and wisedom, and all other graces requisit for your honourable state in this life, and leading to an estate in the life to come, most honourable and euerlasting.
                  
                     
                        Your humblie at commandment. I. Cosyn.
