            THE
ACTS OF THE SCOTISH PARLIAMENT,
THAT WERE CANCELLED IN THE PRINTED COPIES, BEARING THE DATE
OF NOVEMBER 28, 1566;
NOW REPRINTED, FROM THE PERFECT COPY, THAT BEARS THE
DATE OF OCTOBER 12, 1566.
            
               
               THE person, who has caused these cancelled leaves of the Acts of the
Scotish Parliament to be reprinted, had always doubts about the probability
of there being a new edition of those Acts printed by Lekprevick, in
so short a space of time as from the 12th of Oct. 1566 to the 28th of Nov.
of the same year, (which are the dates that the supposed different editions
bear); but unwilling to controvert an opinion that had obtained so general
belief, among those who were most likely to judge accurately on the subject,
he would not hazard his own opinion, till he should have an opportunity
of collating and comparing these supposed different editions. This
he was enabled to do by the favour of Mr. George Chalmers, who is possessed
of a very fine copy of what has hitherto been supposed to be the
first edition, and which he obligingly lent for the purpose of collation.—
When this collation took place, with what is called the second edition, it
was found they were one and the same edition, and differed in nothing but
the cancelled leaves here reprinted. The Acts principally concern the
religion of the country; why they were cancelled requires no explanation,
to any one acquainted with the history of those times, when the Catholic
power was so much on the decline, and the Protestant party had become
so prevalent.
