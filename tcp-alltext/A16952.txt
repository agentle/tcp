               A SVBTILE Ievv, my Liege Lord, babtized, a child & brought vp in our Chriſtian vniverſities, ſtudied maliciously to over throvv the Goſpell & in ſix poinctes he had caught infinite milliones of ours by our notes in Athean vilanie of judaiſme vvith him. I printed a purgation of al our Bishops: that in allovvance of my book shevving vvhat concent God gaue to ſcripture, vvher I diſcomfited his ſide from thoſe ſix quarels, revoking the errours, they are no more in athean vilanie of judaiſme vvith him. The jevv ſayth none other could haue cleared our Goſpel R. cant. being honored vvith a copy beſtovved termes vntolerable. j complain to your LL. and he to the LL. of Amſteldam: that j teach him hovv the jevv had caught in Athean vilanie of judaiſme: & vvil not be cleared. An other complaint of his Libelling againſt the

Scottish miſt, your vviſdome vvill bid Rich: C. ſurceaſe. The time vvas vvhen the k. fvvare full often that I should haue vvhat I vvold for Quenching Sinons fyre. vvher the Kinges Bench hath condemned, he may not plead ſcandalum: Beſides theſe be matters of flat Atheiſme. I vvrot a book to the Lerned nobilitie, amending, errours of our translation in the Bible, & crede, & of ſucceſſor that he brēt. I might as Lavvfully haue ſet croydon on a fyer: an other vvork, & an other, & an other, & an other allovved by D. vvh. & after his death, by the K. he Brent. & at this hour he impriſoneth about a thouſand copies of a commentarie vpon Daniel. Bargulus Illyricus might as Lavvfully. I humbly require juſtice againſt him.
            
               Your maieſties moſt humble ſubiect, Hugh Broughton.
