godly man̄es lettres / desiring
his frendes iudgement / whether
it be laufull for a christian
man to be present at the popishe
Masse / and other supersticious
churche
seruice.
            1557.
            3. Re. 18.
            Wherfore halte ye on bothe sydes? If the Lorde
be God / folowe hym / and if Baal
be / than folowe hym.
         
      
      
         
            
            
            Almighty God lighten our hartes
with the knowlage of his worde / 
and geue vs grace to expresse
our dueties in our
dedes
            THough I well knowe not what
ye be that wrote vnto me / yet it
semeth / that the reuerēt feare of God
resteth in your harte / ād that ye haue
a good opiniō of me. And forasmuch
as ye so earnestly require mi iudgemēt
whether ye maye laufully ī outwarde
dedes and words resemble the papists
in com̄itting Idolatrie at the presēce
of the Masse and other supersticious
churche seruice / so that ye reteyne the
true profession of Christ inwardly in
your harte: albeit this mater hathe bē
ād is already sufficiētly āswered and
plainly determined of late by S. Petre
martyr in the treatise of Cohabitaciō / 
ād in an other worke (as I heare saie)
of S. Ponet late Bishop of wynchestre / wherī
he reproueth Hill and Petresone with other
such like dissēblers ād haltīg heretiks
of thes later dais / prouīg that no

christē mā maie or can at all one tyme
serue God truly with the harte / ād the
deuil with tōgue and body / seing ther
is no drawing of cuttes nor parting
of stakes betwene Christe and Belial:
yet will I (at your earnest request)
opē vnto you also my faithe and minde
therin. For nature willeth / that a
man should gently shewe hym the right
waye that is out of it: and Goddes
worde commaundeth euery man
to loue his neighbour / and (as muche
as in him lieth) to procure and further
his wealthe ād saluacion. And in
dede (for myne owne parte) I am not
ashamed of the Gospel of Christ / 
which I professe▪ For (as S. Paule sayeth)
it is the power of God vnto saluaciō
to euery one that beleueth. And
to thintent ye shall perceaue my iudgemēt
herein not to be rashe / I bring
with me (for a champion) the most excellēt
doctour S. Austē / who if he made
as muche against vs / as he dothe
for vs / should be rolled vp / that all
pulpittes / scholes / barbours shoppes
tauernes ād warehouses should ryng

of him. Such is the practice of the Deuil
ād his worldings / to dissemble ād
hyde all thinges that make against
thē / ād falsly to allege ād racke pieces
of scripture and good mēnes myndes / 
to seme as though they hade som shewe
of truthe for thē. This erroneous
opiniō ād very heresie of dissimulaciō
is not newe / nor yester daie sprōgē out
of the Hill and stone: but the papistes
haue of lōg tyme ēbraced it / ād in kīg
Edwardes daies practiced it / hauing
this general rule / which I wolde not
that ye or any honest mā should folowe.
Iura periura / secretū pādere noli.
That is in Englishe thus.

                  So thou doest not thy secretes vtter,
                  Sweare, and forsweare, it maketh no mater.
               
But this is an olde heresie (newe scoured)
at least of a thousaunt yeare olde
brought in / in. S. Austens tyme by a
certayn sorte of heretikes called Priscillianistes / 
who taught that it was
no sin̄e to ly with the lippes to on that
was not of their owne religiō / so they
kept the truthe in their harte / alledgeing

this sayēg of Dauid in the psal.
lorde who shal dwel in thi tabernacle
&c. He that speaketh truth in his harte:
as though it were ynough ūto saluaciō
to speake the truthe in the hart / 
though he lied neuer so ofte with the
lippes before him that were not / or at
least he toke not for his neighbour / ād
therfore 
                  •
               hike these heretiks: whā S.
Paule saied / Laiēg aparte lyēg / speake
the truthe / he added these wordes:
euery one with his neighbour / to this
purpose / that it might he laufull to
speake a lye to any other that is not
our neighbour / that is / which dothe
not professe that religiō that we doo.
            S. Austē briefly answereth to these
and all suche like obiectiones what so
euer maye be made. If this opiniō ād
doctrine (saieth S. Austē) were foūde
catholike and to be allowed / it disgraceth
and dishonoureth all the martyres / 
and wipeth awaie all persecucion
and martirdome. For by their opiniō
the martirs hade done more godly
and more wisely / if they had not confessed
them selues to be christianes
               
before the tyrannes and persecutours / 
neither hade they made them to be
murtherours / but with lieng and denyeng
the truthe / they should haue
saued their owne bodies / and not haue
suffred them to haue executed the
mischief thei had cōceaued in their mī
               ds.
For the tyrānes and persecutours
were not the martyrs neighbours by
profession of Christes faithe / so that
they were not bounden to speake to
them the truthe with their lippes / 
which they spake with the hart: but
they were the vttre enemies of God
ād the truth. If this wer tolerable ād
good doctrine (saieth S. Austē) what
neded Petre to lament his sine so bitterly
after he hade denied Christ with
his mouthe? Thinke ye he did before
denie him with his harte? No / no (sayeth
S. Austē) he denyed not his maister
Christ with his hart but he lamē
               ted
for the punishmēt that was towarde
him / that he had not professed
with his mouthe to saluaciō / that he
beleued with the hart to iustificaciō.

therfore the wordes of the prophet
Dauid are not so to be takē / that a mā
maie laufully lye with the mouthe / keping
the truthe in his harte. But it is
therfore spokē / bicause it maie be / that
a man maye speake that truthe with
the mouthe / which cā doo hī no good / 
onles it procede frō the botome of the
harte: that is / if he beleue not that he
speaketh: as the auncient heretiks the
priscillianists ād papists did (for they
spake the truthe with the mouthe / as
others did / but thei beleued it not / nor
professed it in harte) and as our hillistes / 
petreson̄istes ād other newe heretikes
do at this present dissemble / liēg
with lippes / ād professing outwardly
thatvhich ī their hartes thei knowe to
be false and cleane cōtrary to goddes
worde / bicause they wolde preserue
their substāce. And therfore neither
of them maye be accompted of the nō
               bre
of those that the prophet sayeth / 
speake the truthe in their harte. A
true christen man as he professeth the
truthe in his harte / bicause he so beleueth / 
so wil he do with the mouthspeake

it to declare it. Agaīst this truthe
ther maye be no deceipt in mouth nor
hart / but he must beleue with the hart
to iustificaciō / ād make cōfessiō with
the mouthe to saluaciō. For ī the same
Psal. after these words / He that speaketh
the truthe with his harte / immediatly
it foloweth. He that hathe not
done deceat ī or with his tōgue. These
words the heretikes (bicause thei mak
agaīst thē) vtterly leaue out. And the
other wordes of thapostle / layeng aparte
liēg / speake the truthe euery mā
with his neighbour / they expoūde as
the Iewes doo their lawe / wher bicause
they be commaunded only to deale
plainly / ād vse mercy with their brethren
and neighbours / they not only
thīke they maie / but also doo vse with
the christianes al subtiltie / deceat / gile / 
and crueltie. But those wordes are
not so to be take / as though ther were
non other our neighbours / but suche
as be presently mēbres of the body of
Christ / and professe one religion and
faith with vs: but that we shoulde take

euery man to be our neighbour / 
whom we wolde haue hereafter to be
our neighbour / albeit he be not presently
our neighbour: as Christ did
declare the Samaritane to be neighbour
to the straunger with whom he
vsed mercy / and the straunger to the
Samaritane.
            And therfore he ought to be taken
for our neighbour and no straunger / 
whom we desire (as we ought to
desire all men) to professe Christ as
we do. And if bicause he is not yet of
our faithe / some misteries ought to
be kept from such a straunger / yet
we ought not therfore to speake vnto
him that which is false. For ther were
in thapostles tyme / that preached
Christ and the truthe not truly: that
is / not with a true minde and sincere
conscience / but of enuie / cōtēcion / and
with a corrupt mīde: ād yet they wer
suffred ād allowed / but non cōmēded
for speakīg of an vntruthe with a safe
conscience. And thapostle saieth: Let
Christ be preached / whether it be by

occasiō / or by truthe: but he saied not
let Christ be first denied / that after he
maye be preached. We maie not doo
euil / that good maie folowe: for if we
doo / our damnacion is iuste and certain.
But let vs turne the wordes / bicause
we haue folowed euil / let vs repent
and doo good / that we maye come
to saluacion. These heretikes allege
for them examples out of scripture.
            As of the mydwyues of the Egipcianes / 
who made a lye to Pharao
to saue the male children of the
Hebrewes / and therfore God blessed
them. Of Rahab / that made a
lye / to saue the two Israelites. Of
Iehu / who fayned him selfe the Seruaunt
of Baal / bicause he wolde
destroie the priestes of Baal. And
of Naaman / that sayed to Eliseus
the Prophet. But herein the lorde
be mercifull to thy seruaunt.
            For whan my maister goeth in to
the house of Remmon to worship
ther / he layneth on my hande / and

I must bowe whā he boweth. And so
many others. But these heretikes are
like Spyders / that sucke poysō out of
swete flowres / not like bees / that sucke
out the swete and profitable honye.
            For the midwiues and Rahab were
not rewarded of God for their lieng / 
but for the mercie they vsed towarde
the people of God. As for Iehu / he is
not in all scripture cōmēded: no / scripture
saieth of him / that his harte was
not right before the Lorde. And the
scripture saieth not / that Naamā hade
a dispensaciō of the prophet. For if
the prophet wolde haue consented to
his request / he hade had nō autoritie
to dispense with Goddes worde. The
dedes of aūcient fathers ād others in
scripture are not writtē / to thintēt we
shoulde folowe thē in euery thīg / but
many euil thīges be declared of them / 
to let vs knowe / that were they neuer
so holy / yet they were men / and might
ād did fall: that knowīg their ād our
weakenesse / we should not trust ī our
owne selues / or ī our owne works / but

confessing our selues to be sinners / we
should call to God for mercie. To be
short / S. Austē concludeth / that for
no cause men maie lye or dissemble: ād
specially ī maters of religiō they may
in no wise doo it. And that that is
thus spoken against liers and dissemblers / 
maketh asmuche agaīst Idolatrie
and wicked doers. For in bothe of
thē the hart and the outwarde senses
doo not agree. And this is a general
sentence in scripture without exception:
Thou hatest (O God) all those
that worke iniquitie / ād shalt destroie
al those that speake lies. And Christ
also saieth: He that confesseth me before
mē / I will confesse him before my
father which is in heauē: and he that
denieth me before mē / I wil denie him
before my father in heauē. And agaī.
Wo be to hī by whō slaūdre cometh.
And again, who so euer offendeth one
of these litle ones which beleue in me / 
it were better for him / that a milstone
were hanged about his necke / ād that
he were drowned in the depthe of the
sea.
            
               Thus ye haue the iudgement of
Saint Austen in your question that
ye moued: with whom I agree and
consent / bicause I am sure / that this
doctrine dothe agree in euery parte
with the worde of God.
            And therfore onles ye thinke your
selfe so sure / that ye are hable to abyde
what so euer crosse shalbe layed
vpon you for Christes sake / tempre
not God in lyngryng in that lande
of the lordes wrathe / but in tyme
come out of Egipte / least with your
ouerlong lyngryng and tempting
of God / he pull awaye his grace from
you / as a vssel not mete to kepe it / 
and so leaue you to your self to your
final destrucion and eternal vndoyng.
            Be not carefull for to morowe / 
make not your good your God / as
they saye: let your worldly substaunce
be your seruaunt and not your
maister / and put your hole trust
in God.
            
               I haue not sene the iuste forsaken
(saieth the Prophet) nor his sede
lacke sustenaunce.
            Doo ye not see the foules of the
ayer (saieth Christ) who albeit they
sowe not / nor reape / neither carie into
Barnes / yet lacke they not: for
your heauenly father fedeth them:
how muche more shall be prouyde
for you / O ye of litle faithe? Remembre
also that comfortable sayeng of
Christ: Who so euer shall forsake
houses or brethren or sisters / or father
or mother / or wife or children / 
or landes for my names sake / the same
shall receaue an hundred folde in
this life / and after this life / life euer
lasting. God is no lyer / ne yet dissembler.
Of his mercie we haue the promyse:
of his veritie / the hope of enheritaunce:
of his iustice / the assuraunce:
and of his power / the full performaūce.
We haue a playne experiēced
exāple of the holy mā Iob / to whom
albeit God suffred Satā to plage hī / 
yet did he make a ful restitucion and

recompēce for all. And therfore leaue
those fleshe pottes / come out of Egipte / 
and serue God bothe with tongue
and harte / with saiēg ād doing / with
the outwarde mā and inwarde man / 
that your spirite and your soule and
your body maie be in euery parte perfitly
sounde (as thapostle sayeth) and
that ye maie with ioie loke for thappearing
of the great God and our saueour
Iesus Christ. For he hauīg made
the hole man / body and soule / to serue
him / wil not be contēt to be serued
with the one parte / ād the Deuil with
the other. Thou shalt worship the lorde
thy God / and serue him alone / saieth
Christ. He will haue all or none.
Therfore seing all cōmoditie must be
hade at his hādes bothe for body and
soule / let him haue all the vse of bothe
as his owne / and despere not of his
prouidence / which is the almighty
eternal God / blessed for euermore:
In whō fare ye as hartily
wel / as I wolde
my selfe
