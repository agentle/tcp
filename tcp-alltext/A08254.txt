Euery perſone that exalteth him ſelfe ſhalbe humiliate / and brought vndre / And be that meketh and humbleth him ſelfe: ſhalbe exalted and brought vp. In this ſaynge holy ſcripture ſheweth vnto vs that euery maner of a mannes owne exaltation or extollence is a kynde and ſpice of pryde / of the which thynge the ꝓphete ſhoweth him ſelfe to beware: ſayng. Good lorde my hart is not exalted / nor my countenans is not hyghe / prowde / nor ſtately.
