               OF the woūdes yt happe neth in ye ſofte mēbres I haue ſayd / as of the ſkyn̄e / fleſſhe / vaynes ſynewes / vnto ye bone So ſhall I wryte of ye harder dele / or partes of ye body. And of all yt is cut wt a ſworde / & yt the fleſſhe & the bone be throughe cut / that is called a woūde wt the fracture or brekyng. & yf ye bone be hurt wt no cuttynge inſtrumēt / but wt a clobbe / or ſtaffe / ſtone / or fallynge / or caſt / or by hym ſelfe / or by another / it is called a fracture or brekynge of ye bones. Sōtyme ye bo ne breketh ouertwharte yt in the fracture wt the brekynge is no ſmal peces of the bone / & yt comenly is called a fracture. & ſomtyme ye bone is beten & hurte / & is vneuen brokē wt ſplenters yt one pece or many peces depteth from other / yt is called fruſtralis / or ye bone broken wt peces. Somtyme it is not brokē ouertwhart / nor wt peces / but it is rente in length / then it is called Apertura or rente. The token of ye fracture or brekynge / yf it be in brede or in length / It is knowen wel ynoughe by the ſyght & by vnderſtādynge / as haly abbas & Lāfrā. ſayth / & can ye not ſe ye fracture / ye ſhall know thrugh ſelynge wt your hāde on ye bone (as Raſis & Auicē. ſayth) ¶ The payne of the bone as it is tow chyd / & the feblenes therof is a token of the fracture. And as ther is in ye fracture ſplentes or peces / then ye ſhall fele by the peces about ye fracture & it wyl prycke in ye fleſſhe & the pacyent feleth the pryckynge ouer the place of the fracture / & mooſt whā you tow che it with your hande. ¶ The fracture or rynyng that cometh in the length of ye bone is worſer to be knowen than the fracture yt cometh ouertwharte ye bone / but it is knowen for ye membre is greter and thycker / & that the pacient with ye membre may not laboure as he hath done before tymes. That bone yt is ouertwhart broken in. ii. peces yt is more peryllous to bynde and to holde / than is the bone that is broken or rente in ye length. Therfore as ſuche a fracture is heled it is altymes vneuē and croked / pryncy pally as the fracture is in a bone yt ſtandeth alone with none other ſtandyng ther by / ly ke as the formeſt bone in the arme / and in ye ſhynnes. ¶ The fracture by the ioyntes it is the heuyeſt & the worſt to bynde / And yt can not well be bounden for there cometh often tymes grete payne in the meuynge / & hardneth the fracture with payne and mar rynge of the fleſſhe / And yf it haue moche moyſtnes it is euyll / bycauſe he can not be▪ holpē for the tyme ye fayntnes muſt be fyrſt amended. ¶ The fracture with a wounde hathe a ſondry cure / & ye muſt make holes in the bande / through the whyche it may be heled where as nede is. ¶ Whan ony frac ture is longe vnbounde it is dredfull and ye worſe. ¶ And yf the fracture ware harde / than is it the worſe to ſet to gyder / and ther fore it is nedefull to haue a greate ſtronge

byndyge / and the grete ſtronge byndynge is peryllous ſor comynge onyhete & crampe (as Auicenna ſayth)
            ¶ To knowe in what tyme the bones may be heled / that is to knowe. The braynnan may be heled in. xl. dayes. The bone of the noſe is heled in. xiiii. dayes. The rybbes in xx. dayes. and ſo forth it ſhall be ſayd hereafter. But the age of a man taketh awaye ſuche comely tyme of helynge. Jamericus Auicenna / and haly abbas ſayth / what is the cauſe that the tyme is longe or ye bones be heled to gyder / It cometh often tymes yt the bones be oftē tymes dreſſed / and moyſtned with warme water / and with often ty mes meuynge / and that ther is to lytell ſly my blood / and throughe ſtrayte byndynge it beletteth the membre to fede / & hyndreth hym of his helynge. And it is ſayd that the ſwellynge of the membre wout grete payn after ye byndynge / & ſlaketh the ſwellynge after the tyme of the ſettynge agayne of the bones that is a good token.

Terfore this is my counſayle to take this ſtore for this cure. that powder hathe ſuch nature / yf there come ony ſwellynge to the bone at the fyrſt tyme ſo gothe the ſwellynge ſhortly awaye with the ſayd powder. The other maner is that after the. xii. or. xv. daies as porus begynue to come / that is to knowe whan the payne is gone / and ther come none impoſtumacyon / and ye membre is of good colour / than ſhall ye take of the bande / and waſſhe the membre in warme water & lay thervpō a clothe ſtryken / and bynde it with all the bandes and ſplentes a foreſayd / and bynde it ſom what faſter. The fracture ſhalbe ſalued and dreſſed the. vii. or. ix. day. or more vnto the tyme that the bone be well bounde with that porus that is well knowē by me uynge and by the vnſwellynge.

                   ſhall the membre be brought by lytell and lytell to his olde workynge / and at the laſt ſhall the membre be made ſofte with Dyal the a / or oxcicrocium. ¶ The fourth maner is when the accydente is comynge / lyke yf ther were payne or impoſtumacyon / and yf the payne or impoſtumacyon be grete / that take away or it be boūde wt the longe band that ther to belongeth.
