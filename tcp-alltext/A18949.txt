               MY deare Siſter, the Dedication of this Poeme can belong to none more fitly, then to your ſelfe; ſince (next vnder God) your care of mee in a deſperate ſickneſſe, made me liue to finiſh it. It is a Tranſlation, and therefore farre ſhort of the Originall, the rather becauſe mine:) A Worke not ſo pleaſing for Ladies (being in it ſelfe lofty, and harſh in the

tranſlation.) It was intended to you, as a Patterne for a piece of Needle-work (I knew you were about;) for which purpoſe; I perſwade my ſelfe, no Poeticall Authour will with more variety furniſh you, then Claudian: howſoeuer hee or I faile▪ yet this firſt labour may ſeeme as an earneſt-penny of my affection, and to tell you, that all true happineſſe in this life, and eternall in the next, is wiſht vnto you▪
            
            
               By your Brother and friend, obliged euer to ſerue you,

            To the READER.
            GEntle Reader, I preſent to thy view the three firſt books of Claudianꝰ, de raptu Proſerpinae in Engliſh Verſe: a work (how pleaſing it may proue, I know not) ſince of my Authour, Scaliger ſayth, he was materia ignobiliore oppreſſus, but addidit de ingenio quantum defuit materiae, which wit, the Tranſlators harſhneſſe of ſtile may (haply) haue diminiſhed. The Reader will finde many faults; one I willingly here preuent, which is, that Ceres is deſcribed in the firſt booke to be drawne by ſixe Dragons, contrary to all Poets, that allow her but two: This and ſome few other errors I impute vnto the haſtineſse of the Preſſe, which the ingenious Reader will pardon, eſpecially if the maine worke giue that light (that I hope for) to the Originall.
            Farewell.
            
               L. D.
            
            
         
         
            
            THE RAPE OF PROSERPINE.
            
               The Hiſtoricall Senſe or meaning of the Storie.
               WHen men for their finnes, like other creatures, were forced to ordinary foode: the bread which they ate of (as Euſebius and Suidas mention) was of Acornes: and Plutarke writes, that after the Flood it was of the ſame. At that time, Siculus reigned King of Sicilie, whoſe wife (named Ceres) a woman of a ſingular apprehenſion (to trie a Concluſion) tooke ſome of the wilde Wheate, which groweth naturally ſo in that Country, and ſowed ſeedes of the ſame, and was carefull to till them: theſe in their due time produced of that Graine in great abundance, which ſhee cauſed to bee moulded into a paste, and (finding the ſweetneſſe of it) ſtill ſowed more and more, till ſhe attained to the perfection

of Tillage; (with which ſhee inſtructed all her Iſlanders) ſo that the Sicilians were the firſt Husband-men in the world, and taught other Nations, till ſuch time as Wheate became the generall nouriſher of all men.
               The commoditie the Sicilians reaped hereby, and the multitudes of ſuch as applyed themſelues to Tillage, were the cauſes of the diuiſions of lands (touching which, Ceres made ſundry lawes) ſome of which remaine euen at this day with vs: and for this cauſe the blinde Gentiles adored her as a goddeſſe, and conſecrated that Iſland of Sicilie vnto her, as to the inuentreſſe of Harueſt.
               It happened that this Ceres had a daughter, called Proſerpina; who, for her exceeding beautie was affected by Orion King of Epirus and the Moloſſians, and by him ſtolne away in the abſence of her Mother Ceres: who when ſhee returned, and found that her daughter was thus gone (ignorant of the Rauiſher) went ranging vp and downe the world to finde her, and in her progreſſe ſhee ſowed all the Fields with Wheate as ſhee went, till ſuch time as ſhee found Orion out.
               
                  
This Story gaue matter to Poets, to faine, that Pluto ſtole away Proſerpina from Sicilia, in her mothers abſence (who miſsing her at her returne) ſought her thorow the world, till ſhe had found her with two blazing lights: and knowing that ſhee was in hell with Pluto, requeſted of Iupiter, that ſhe might remaine with her one halfe of the yeere vpon Earth, and the other with her Husband Pluto.
               
            
            
               The Naturall Senſe of the Storie.
               
               BY the perſon of Ceres is ſignified Tillage. By Proſerpine, the ſeedes which are ſowed, by Pluto, the earth that receiues them.
               By the diligence that Ceres vſed in ſearching her daughter, is ſhewne the care that Huſband-men ought to haue in the tilling and ſowing their grounds, and reaping of their Harueſt.
               By the ſixe Moneths that Proſerpine remained in Hell, are vnderſtood, the ſixe, in which

the ſeede is vnder ground, before the eares appeare; and by the other ſixe that ſhee is with her Mother, is ſet downe, when the corne is ripe, and in poſſeſſion of the Husbandman.
               By the blazing lights, with which Ceres ſeekes her daughter, is meant the vigilancie of the Husbandman in prouiding for the increaſe of his harueſt.
               By the lights themſelues, are ſignified the inſtruments of Husbandry, without which the Corne could hardly be reaped.
            
            
               The Allegoricall Senſe.
               
                  BY Pluto and his ſuddaine reſolution of marrying and warring againſt gods, is noted, the nature and diſpoſition of the inſolent rich man, who blinded with eaſe and plenty, deſireth immoderately all that his Concupiſcence leades him vnto.
               By the Deſtinies that ſtriue to diuert Pluto from his purpoſe, is ſeene the force of heauenly power aboue humane.
               
                  
                  Mercurie's, being ſent Ambaſſador to Iupiter, declares how neceſſarie it is that perſons of a liuely capacitie and mature iudgement, be ſent to take vp ſtrife and iarres betwixt Princes.
               By Iupiters decree to giue Proſerpine for wife to Pluto, is ſhewne the Diuine Prouidence, that diſpoſeth better of things for vs, then we our ſelues can wiſh.
               By Proſerpine left alone in her mothers abſence at her worke, is noted the good education of Children, to which mothers are bound, that are honeſt and carefull.
               By Ceres leauing her alone, and Pluto's ſtealing her away, is put (as an example): That Mothers ought not to be ſo careleſſe of their children, as to expoſe them to ſo great a hazard of their honours.
               By Venus Executionereſſe of Ioues will, and Diana and Pallas her Companions, is ſignified: that loue is a diuine connexion and bond, ordained from God, if the proceeding in the ſame bee with ſimplicity and pureneſſe of meaning.

               MY loftie Muſe is full, and bids me ſing
               The robbery of Hell's infernall king,
               Grimme Pluto; and the Carre of Taenarus,
               
               That whilome with portentionsominous
               And giddie hurrie, through the blaſted ayre,
               Preſagd the Rape of Proſerpine the fayre,
               
                  Ioues daughter, and the marriges euent:
               Profaner eares be you from hence exempt.
               
                  
And now the furie of a Spirit Diuine,
               Expell's all humane feare from this of mine:
               
                  Apollo breathes in me, Phoebus inſpires
               My braine, my quill with his moſt ſacred fires.
               Now, now (me thinkes) I on a ſuddaine ſee,
               The Shrine of each immortall deitie,
               Shake in it's quiu'ring ſeate (vnus'd to moue)
               And the Coeleſtiall rayes (that from aboue
               Diſperſe their glim'ring light) forerunners are,
               Of Pluto's iourny and ſad Ceres care.
               The noyſe (that in the earth's deepe wombe doth ſound)
               I heare, and Athens Temple ſo renown'd,
               For her King Cecraps painfully doth grone,
               (Doubling ſhrill Eccho's to the Cities mone:)
               And Ceres lou'd Eleuſis tapers blaze
               With flaring lights which to the skies they raiſe:
               
                  Triptolem's ſnakes their bloudie creſts aloft
               Vpſtretch, and with confuſed murmur ſoft,
               Glide their ſpot-painted bodies here and there,
               At which Spectators tremble, themſelues feare:
               They hiſſe, and with ſtrange accent to my Verſe
               Haſten the Tragicke ſong that I rehearſe.
               The three-folde Hecate appear's in ſight,
               And lazy Bacchus (madding) doth affright
               The eyes of mortals with his ſhiu'ring lance
               Of wreathed Vines, and in a drunken dance
               (Loading his Temples with an Yuie crowne,
               Whoſe weight keepes his vnweldy body downe)
               Knits to his necke a Parthian Tyger's pawes,
               And skinne (that from his ſhoulder downe he drawes)
               You gods (on whom Auernus wandring ſoules,
               And multitudes of wights blacke Styx enroules)
               
                  
Attend, and ſuch as of their worldly crimes,
               In burning Phlegeton bewaile the times.
               You gods, you fathers, ſhew; declare to me
               The ſecrets of earths vaſte concauity;
               Your gouernments reueale, and myſteries
               Of all thoſe great and powerfull deities.
               Tell me, ſince Loue ſo lowe would neuer bend
               His ſhafts, what fire could Pluto thus incend?
               As ſnatching off from earth this Proſerpine,
               
               He makes her his eternall Concubine:
               Yet comforts her (that in the Tyrants pow'r,
               Laments) by giuing Lethe for her dow'r.
               Tell me, did Ceres her grieu'd mother know
               Before, what ſhould ſucceed? or if not ſo,
               When ſhe was loſt, in her diſtracted minde,
               Where could ſhe hope her Proſerpine to finde?
               That (longing for good newes) ſhee makes a vowe,
               The barren earth with faireſt wheate to ſowe.
               Long ſince, the diſmall Prince of Erebus
               
               (Through wrath and fury growne outragious)
               To ſee that he (a god) and young, alone,
               Muſt leade a ſolitary life in mone,
               Wanting a mate, that dayes, moneths, yeeres retire
               And paſſe (regardleſſe of his quenchleſſe fire)
               Impatient of delaies and full of iarre,
               He ſummons all the ſupreme gods to warre;
               Diſdaining they aboue ſhould note his want,
               Of happy marriage to be ignorant.
               Redde lips, faire eyes, ſweet lookes, ſoft cheriſhing
               Confus'd embraces, limbes proportioning,
               To their proportion all ſtrange delight,
               Two ſoules combin'd in one, which make one white:
               
                  
Like yuie (twining) yuorie necke, that one,
               One body, which one common breath alone,
               Giues life vnto: this one, and yet not one
               For (louers) each hath a Companion:
               So two, when as two bodies ſtriuing moue
               In Cuptds liſts (made one by mutuall loue.)
               Theſe two, that one and all as motiues are,
               Egging ſterne Pluto to ambitious warre:
               The name of father, and proud hope of ſonnes,

               Their gyues knockt off, and former libertie:
               That (breaking vp hels dung'ons) once againe,

               With fainting voice ſhe to him gently cries,
               And thus begins. Thou mighty king (ſaith ſhe)
               Great Ruler of our vaſte obſcuritie,
               Thou (to whoſe ſacred iudgement) the leaſt wight
               That groanes in darkeneſſe, and hels horrid night
               Is ſubiect; thou, whom loyall Fates haue ſeru'd
               So long and from thy precepts neuer ſweru'd,
               With web and ſpindle; thou that firſt giu'ſt breath
               To all things liuing, thou, whom life and death,
               Equally waite on; thou, to whom the ſage
               Fleet time, what ruines he in euery age
               Collects, doth giue; and vnto thee the ſtate
               Of preſent things doth likewiſe conſecrate:
               And laſtly thou, by whom, the Soules condemn'd
               Haue ſecond being, torture without end.
               Seeke not (great Prince) to haue thine honor ſtain'd
               (By breach of ſacred lawes wee firſt ordain'd:)
               Cauſe thy robuſtious troopes retire, and ceaſe
               T'incenſe them further 'gainſt high heauens peace
               
                  
Deſiſt from hoſtile armes (impietie)
               Of making brother gods thine enemy;
               But if thou needs wilt venter, be no more
               A pow'r Diuine, but ſome wilde ſauage Bore:
               Muſt Gyant race enioy a ſecond light,
               And once againe outbraue in Martiall fight
               Th'vnconquer'd gods? Fye Pluto: do not thus
               Attempt a Warre ſo ſacrilegious,
               And headlong caſt thy Maieſtie, forbeare;
               (If Marri'ge be the cauſe; or if thou feare
               Leſt Ioue deny thee iſſue) mildly proue
               Great Iupiter: firſt let him heare thy loue.
               
                  Pluto heares Lacheſis: and though his rage
               Were ſuch, as her faire ſpeech could ſcarce aſſwage;
               Yet when the loftie loue ſtrooke god, might ſee,
               The Siſters both to her ſoft prayers agree;
               The bloud that riſeth in each blacke ſwolne vaine,
               He tempereth: the Furies ſtraight proclaime
               His alter'd purpoſe, cu'ry Fiend that droopes
               To ſee this change, they laſh, and force hels troopes
               Retire, thus was this fatall enterpriſe,
               Diſmiſt, and Pluto calm'd by Deſtinies.
               So bluſt'ring Boreas (when with roaring guſt,
               And whirle-winde arm'd) he firſt doth lay the duſt,
               Then with a ſuddaine and tempeſtuous blaſt,
               (Enrag'd) he faine vpon earth's face would caſt;
               Thicke ſtormes of hayle eu'n at the inſtant, when
               With full ſwolne cheekes he breakes his loathed denne,
               And (ſcowring the vaſte Seas) would cauſe their flouds
               Ariſe (to drowne the fields and neighb'ring woods:)
               Eu'n then the milder Aeolus reſtraines
               His force, and keepes him fetter'd in ſtrong chaines.
               
                  
                  Pluto commands that ſubtill Mercury
               
               
                  Ioue's ſonne (being ſummon'd to appeare from high)
               Approach his preſence, and from thence be ſent
               To tell the gods his Vncles diſcontent:
               The winged meſſenger without delay
               (Swifter then thought) through the dull ayre makes way,
               And with his colour'd hat, and charming rod
               Forth-with appeares before th'infernall god;
               Who, in the darkeſt Vault of all, ſate (plac't
               Vpon a blacke rude throne:) ſo meanly grac't
               VVith ſcepter courſe; only his viſage ſtout,
               The horrour of his Maieſtie ſet out:
               Ouer his head hangs vp a diſmall Cloud,
               Which ſerues for cloth of ſtate, and now aloud
               'Twixt rage and griefe he groans, and faine would ſpeak,
               When, at firſt accent of his words (that breake
               Through hearers eares) at their firſt hideous ſound,
               The royall palace and moyſt chambers round
               All ſhake againe; and at the fearefull note
               The triple Porter ſtops his howling throat:
               The three ſad riuers at th'vnuſuall voyce
               Affrighted ſtand, and ſtop their murm'ring noiſe,
               All hell was ſilent; but their king exceeds,
               And to his yelling Embaſſie proceeds.
               
                  Ioues high-borne brood, Cylenian Mercurie:
               
               Olde Atlas Nephew, common deity
               To heauen and hell: thou, that haſt paſſage free
               Through both the Poles, and equall liberty;
               Thou, that of all the gods both high and low,
               The myſteries and ſtrict comerce doſt know:
               Fly hence, with speedy wing cut through the winde,
               To thy vngratefull Sirethus ſpeake our minde,
               
                  
What right haſt thou, or what prioritie,
               (Cruel'ſt of all thy brothers) ouer me?
               Say, Fortune blind with an vnequall hand,
               (To me denying) gaue thee heau'ns command?
               Yet are theſe temples honour'd with a crowne,
               As well as thine, nor can thy pride beate downe
               Our glory; though we want the light, thou ſhalt
               Perceiue our ſtrength, when I thy walls aſſault:
               Think'ſt thou the Cyclop's handy-worke I feare;
               Or thoſe vaine claps that mocke the yeelding ayre?
               Caſt downe thy darts of thunder, let them ſtrike
               Affrighted mortals, we are farte vnlike
               To ſuch; Know, Iupiter, I keepe my vowe,
               And to reuenge my griefes, am ſure (though ſlowe)
               VVas't not enough? I then repined not
               At Fates, that firſt to my accurſed lot
               Gaue this third kingdome, and depriued quite,
               (Though ſatisfied) I neuer ſought for light:
               Nor wiſht bright Phoebus might deſcend ſo farre
               As my ſad palace, or the morning ſtarre
               Lighten theſe vaults; when vnto thee the ſeau'n,
               (That make Charles-wayne twinkle in ſpangled heau'n)
               And millions more thy glorious ſtate adorne:
               Poore I, that all in darkneſſe ſit forlorne
               (Diſcomfortably mournfull) no glad ſight
               Enioy, but waſte in a perpetuall night,
               VVhere are no comforts to the eye or eare,
               Nothing but noyſe, and notes of ghaſtly feare,
               For what harmonious muſicke hath hells king?
               Where ghoſts keep howling time, whil'ſt ſcriech-owles ſing:
               Yet thou that ſee'ſt me bare of all reliefe,
               (The more to aggrauate my ſullen griefe)
               
                  
Forbidd'ſt me Nuptiall rites; thus Ioue repines
               At Pluto's wiſhes, when his Concubines
               Are numberleſſe; the Sea-god happier is,
               (Though leſſe in power then I) and hath more bliſſe,
               That when the raging billowes he allayes,
               Faire Amphitrite with her Neptune playes
               And he (intangled in her ſoft embrace)
               Forgets the vſe of his three-forked mace.
               When thou in midſt of Tytans ſcorching heate,
               With labour of thy thunder-claps doſt ſweate
               To coole the partch't earth, with moiſt drops of raine,
               And (weary of thy toyle turn'ſt backe againe)
               Inceſtuous Iuno ſits in longing ſtate
               VVith open lap her Lord to recreate:
               
                  Latona, Ceres, Themis: (each of which
               Sufficient were) but all of theſe, enrich
               Thee, with the name of father, and thy ſeate
               Keepe ſtill with hopefull ſucceſſors repleace:
               Thus thou, in luſtfull ryot (varying)
               Liu'ſt at thine eaſe, whil'ſt I (thy brother king)
               In darkeſt dungeon (like a ſlane) am voyde
               Of thoſe delights, with which thou moſt art cloid:
               And thus my prime of youth doth fade, and pride
               Of iſſue, failes; (by wanting alov'd Bride)
               But come reuenge, awake dull patience,
               (Suffice long pardon for ſo iuſt offence)
               By all the ſhades of night, by all the Ghoſts
               That houer o're blacke Styx, by all the hoſts
               Of dreadfull horror, miſchiefe vengeance dire,
               If Iupiter denie this laſt deſire;
               The walls of Tartarus ſhall open wide
               (Thorough whoſe breach) the ſoules that there abide
               
                  
(Condemn'd to endleſſe ruth) ſhall ſally out,
               And haſt thy downfall with confuſed rowt:
               (Mongſt whom) old Saturne once againe ſhall free
               The golden age from her captiuitie.
               (This ſayd) the Tyrant ceaſt, and to his ire
               Gaue reſpit. Mercury (like nimble fire)
               Meane while aſcends vp to the higheſt Spheare,
               And tells his meſſage to great Iupiter.
               
               The god, vnto this vnexpected newes
               Gaue ſtrict attention, and forth-with' gins muſe
               In his diuine breſt, what would be th' euent
               Of ſuch a marri'ge, who would be content
               (Of all the goddeſſes) to loſe the light
               In lieu ſhe may be queene of laſting night,
               And (like a Iudge reuoluing many a doubt,
               At length reſolu'd) his ſentence thus breakes out,
               One only child the goddeſſe Ceres had
               One daughter, which doth make her mother glad:
               For though Lucina bleſt her with no more,
               Yet is ſhe happy in this firſt ſhe bore.
               This ſerues for many, and the want ſupplies,
               That ſecond birth her barren wombe denies.
               This (as her deareſt darling and delight)
               She often hugges, ſtill tends, and from her ſight
               She neuer let's her part; ſo Heifer young
               Or firſt yeeres Calfe, (that other beaſts among
               Scarce preſſeth the ſoft graſſe with wanton tread,
               Nor horned Moones, yet peepe from curled head:)
               The lowing Damme (that it by chance doth miſſe)
               (Finding) doth giue it many a licking kiſſe.
               The Virgin faire was growne now ripe and neare
               To Hymens rites, a chaſte and ſhamefaſt feare
               
                  
Breeds in her breſt new flames: now ſhe deſires
               (One while) to marrie; then againe loues fires
               Deſpitefully ſhe quencheth; thus, her mind
               Eu'n in a moment, makes her curſt and kinde;
               To loue, and not to like; which myſterie
               Is caus'd by feare, that beares the maſtery
               Ouer her will (her will that oft doth call
               Her paſſions vp) but feare ſtraight layes them all:
               Now ſtore of ſuters throng and each 'gins ply
               Old Ceres, for her daughter (cunningly)
               Two great Competitors, with equall ſtrife
               Contend, to haue the louely Mayd to wife:
               
                  Mars with his ſhield, Apollo with his bowe
               And ſhafts, their greatneſſes alike both ſhewe.
               Both offer a round earneſt for their loues;
               Yet neithers ſuite the yellow Ceres moues:
               Nor though proud Iuno and Latona too
               Speake for their ſonnes and (ſeuerally woo)
               VVould ſhe conſent: but (as a mother kind
               In her owne thoughts) and with fond paſſion blind:
               (Vnwitting future rape) her too too deare,
               She ſought to hide from thoſe ſhe leaſt might feare.
               And thus (deſcending from Olympus high,
               With her faire Proſerpine) both ſecretly
               At fruitfull Scicile arriue; and there,
               The carefull mother in a iealous feare,
               Viewes the rich Iſland, and the Sea that round
               Doth ring-like compaſſe, and its fertile ground,
               Sprinkle; th'vnknowing goddeſſe ſtraight conceiues
               The place for purpoſe fitting, and ſo leaues
               Her daughter to it's charge: thus neither ſhe,
               Nor it, ſoreſawe th'enſuiug prodigie.
               
                  
                  Sicilia once the Continent did touch,
               And made a part of Italy, till, ſuch
               Was the Seas rage, and Nereus ſwelling pride,
               As did the firme land ſeuer and diuide:
               He with his ſubtill art, and puiſſance ſtout
               The confines broke, and cut thoſe mountaines out,
               Which, to the little land did there remaine,
               Contiguous were; now (parted from the maine)
               He bathes them with his waues, yet men may ſee
               'Twixt both the Lands a knowne affinitie.
               The Promontories that are ſeene from farre,
               
                  Pachinus high, and Lilibeum are
               On which the waues that (brauing play) let flee
               Their force, and make continuall batterie:
               
                  Pachinus ſhewes vnto th' Ionian Sea
               His lofty head; the top of Lylibe
               
               Lookes to the Libian Coaſt, from whence (in vaine)
               The waues driues through his armes, which (as a reine
               And bridle ſerue t'abate and curbe their pride
               And roaring noyſe;) when Thetis to abide
               Diſdaineth there, and from the Thuſcane ſhore,
               Her waues vpon Pelorus beate much more.
               Theſe Promontories three, at firſt the Ile
               
                  (Sicilia now) Trinacria did ſtile:
               In midſt of which Aetna of old renowne
               (For burning rockes) ſo high his flaming crowne
               Lifts; that the Promontories (which before
               Did Gyants ſeeme) like Dwarfes his height adore:
               
                  Aetna, true witneſſe of Briareus
               
               His folly, and of bold Enceladus
               
               The Tombe and bonefire; where, he liues in death,
               And ſpits forth fire with brimſtone-pois'ning breath:
               
                  
The Mountaines load, there, keeps him priſoner faſt,
               That when the weighty burden off to caſt
               He (groaning) ſtriues, and to his vtmoſt ſtraines
               To quit his rebell necke from yoke and paines:
               The poore Inhabitants he maketh feare

               Should roote the Iſlands vp, and ſo, her towrs,
               And walles, the violence of Seas deuours:
               This Mountaines top, is only to the eye
               Of mortals ſubiect; ſo you may deſcrie
               The ſmoke and flames, but neuer hath it yet
               Been trampled on by any humane feet:
               With ſtately Groues and Trees, the lower part
               Is deckt, that ne're were planted there by Art;
               The vpper, commonly with miſty fogge
               Staines the Sun-beams, and dayes cleere light doth clog
               With pitchy Clouds, which (laſting vntill night)
               Aſcend the Firmament, and dayes cleere light
               Conuert to darkneſſe; ſtill the flames increaſe
               Is nouriſht (though the mountaines ſelfe decreaſe.)
               In midſt of boiling heate, the ſnow doth fall
               Vpon the top, and neuer melts at all:
               It ſnowes vpon the Mountaine, and that heate
               Which burneth there (albeit ne're ſo great)
               The ſnow it ne're offends, whoſe inward cold
               Condenſeth it, and if diſſolue ſome ſhould,
               (By reaſon of hot vapors that ariſe)
               Yet moſt vpon the top congealed is,
               Or neuer lower falls: but that which breeds
               The greateſt admiration, and exceeds
               All common wonder, is the noyſe within
               The hollow Cliftes, that doth neuer linne
               
                  
It's raging, whether cauſed by the wind,
               That ſtopt in Aetnas bowels faine would find
               A paſſage out, and cannot, till it breake
               With ſpeedy motion through ſome open creake
               Of the torne rockes, till when, it rumbles there;
               Or elſe the greedy Sea, whoſe armes doe teare
               The Mountaines boſome, and the brackiſh waues
               Mingling with fires in thoſe hot ſulf'rous caues
               Within, and wanting meanes to ſally thence,
               Adde matter to the broiling violence
               And noyſe; vncertaine whether of the twaine
               It is, but one may be the reaſon plaine.
               Diuineſt Ceres now moſt confident
               Of the ſure Iſland (to whoſe charge ſhe lent
               And left her deareſt pledge) without all feare
               Or leaſt ſuſpicion of her danger neere,
               To Phrigia poſteth, and amaine doth hie
               To her torne foundreſſe mother Cybele.
               
               By ſixe fierce Dragons, that (taile wheeling round
               With writhed limbes) her chariot lift from ground,
               She carri'd is, and ſnatcht into the ayre,
               From whence her ſpeedy flight (they ſwift) prepare,
               And, breaking through the clouds, that giue them way,
               Them leaue behind; and (poſting) lead away
               With giddy gallop, the free raines they beare
               Vpon their lofty creſts (bemoiſtned were
               With foamie froth) which on their golden ſcales
               They caſt, and doubly ſpot their winged ſailes:
               One while the middle Region they diuide,
               And ſoare aloft; then ſuddainly they ſlide
               Downe to the earth, and ſlacking of their flight,
               The Chariots golden wheeles they couer (white)
               
                  
With hoarie duſt: their Miſtris (as ſhe goes)
               Her bountie caſts, and plenteouſly beſtowes
               O're all the fields: the very tract and path
               (Made by her wheeles) ſufficient plentie hath
               Of rip'ned eares; which (as ſhe paſſeth on)
               Cloath all the fields and wayes they run vpon
               VVith golden habit. Thus behind her quite
               
                  Aetna ſhe leaues, and th'Iſland out of ſight,
               Till (looking backe with her preſaging eies,
               And moiſt'ned cheekes) the palace ſhe eſpies
               VVhere ſhe her daughter left; then with freſh teares
               She doubles her prognoſticating feares
               (As doubtfull of the fatall accident)
               And thus the hard miſhap would faine preuent
               (By courting the faire Iſland) Deareſt Earth,
               Bleſt Soyle (ſaith ſhe) farwell: my firſt, laſt birth,
               I leaue vnto thy charge; looke well to her,
               Be thou her guardian ſafe, ſince I preferre
               Thee before other places: as thy care
               Shall ſpeed, the mindfull Ceres will not ſpare
               For thy reward: be ſure of this before,
               The cruell Spade ſhall neuer wound thee more;
               Nor rugged Clowne (when he thy fields will ſowe)
               Shall once, with crooked tooth of deluing plow,
               Teare vp thy fruitfull entrailes; thou ſhalt make
               Glad husbandmen to wonder, and forſake
               The vſe of toyling Oxen, and ſharpe Goad,
               VVhen (of their owne accord) thy fields ſhall load
               Their Barnes; and (for thy ſeaſonable fruit)
               Their ſtore-houſe, neighb'ring lands ſhall thee ſalute.
               This ſaid, her Dragons haſte, and ſhe arriues
               Vpon Mount Ida, where Cybete liues:
               
                  
Her Temple, there, with marble ſtatue ſtands,
               (That worſhipt is by many vprear'd hands,
               Couer'd with thickeſt boughes of blazing Pine)
               That ſeldome ſubiect is to ſtormes or winde:
               The furious Ayre doth ſeldome laſh, or beate
               This conſecrated Tree to goddeſſe great;
               But (gently whiſtling 'mongſt the leaues) it beares
               And formes ſoft muſicke to the hearers eares:
               VVithin the Temple, nought but dancing is
               To Bacchus, and confuſed melodies
               Of men, that (with their howling conſorts round
               Of ſqueaking Pipes and ruſticke Tabors ſound)
               Shake Idas top; the holy ſhrines within
               The Temple groane (mou'd with the noyſe and dinne:)
               At ſight of Ceres all growes huſht and ſtill,
               The balling Quire, the Drumme and Trumpets ſhrill
               Deſiſt; the Corybantes ceaſe to waue
               Their glitt'ring blades, the Lions fierce and braue
               Are tamed, and their gentleneſſe is ſuch,
               As they their ſhaggy maines to euery touch
               Submit; the longing Ceres enters in,
               And by the mother of the gods within
               She welcom'd is, that at firſt entring place
               Bowes downe her Towr's to do the goddeſſe grace.

Be giuen to hels blacke king; for Deſtinies
               Do ſo command, and Themis prophecies
               Haue thus foretold: the time inuites to this,
               Her careleſſe mother farre off wandring is;
               Goe then, and to Sicilia take thy flight,
               That (when bright Sol, the mournfull robe of night
               Diſplayes, and clads the fields in gorgeous ray)
               Entice thou maiſt the mayd, to ſport and play
               In Floras walkes; that (when thy skill is tri'd,
               
                  Pluto may ſeyze vpon his louely Bride:
               Vnfitting 'twere (ſince all the gods, and me

               No, no; let fell Erynnis feele thy flame,
               And Acheron acknowledge the great name
               Of Venus; ſhe gaue eare, and (hauing heard
               Her fathers mind) to iourney ſtraight prepar'd:

               (Together) with their ſiſter, for ſo Ioue
               
               Commanded had; they out of filiall loue
               Their Sire obey, and (taking ſolemne leaue
               Of all the gods) them of their ſight bereaue.
               Looke how a Comet (ſeldome ſeene) appeares
               To vulgar eyes, and fils men with ſtrange feares:
               When (ſtreaming o're the world with bloudy light)
               It boades vnto the peoples gazing ſight
               Some rare euent: (as death of Monarke great,
               Or rage of ſicknes ſprung from Dog-dayes heate:)
               That, to the trembling Mariner (at hand)
               Threatens huge ſtormes, plagues, famine to the land;
               So ſhew'd the ayry tracke this troope diuine
               Had made (amazing with it's glorious ſhine.)
               
                  
At length, they Ceres palace had eſpy'd
               And glorious luſt're of it's top deſcride,
               And pinacles; that (as they neerer drew)
               The goodly frame they might at leiſure view:
               (A wondrous worke) erected firſt of all
               By the blacke lab'ring Cyclop's; the high wall
               Of hard and ſtrongeſt Thracian Ir'n was made,
               The maſſy poſts that ſuſtain'd and ſtai'd
               The weightie building vp, of ſteele: and wrought
               The reſt was, with the Metall thither brought

               Aroſe; nor bellowes, with more violence
               Breath'd on the burning Forge. Behold you might

               Here louely Proſerpine, with melting tone,
               Sat, to her dying honour (all alone)
               VVarbling a ſwan-like farewell: for, ſhe meant
               VVith worke in hand, and needle, to preſent
               
                  
Vnto her Mother (whom ſhe longs to ſee
               And ſtill expects) her painefull induſtrie
               Drawne out in curious ſampler; and ſo thought,
               (In vaine) to frame a robe of it (being wrought:)
               There ſhe her fathers kingdome firſt began
               In liuely colours to paint out; and than
               Foure Elements (each in their order plac't)
               With cunning hand ſhe flouriſht, and ſo grac't
               The patterne with her skill, you could not know
               Whether the fire were burning there or no:
               Somewhat beneath (in region cleere and faire)
               She figur'd had the freſh and liuely aire,
               And next, the water, where ſhe often makes
               A period to her handy-worke; and takes
               Freſh ſilke to thred her needle, for ſhe here
               Had much adoe to make the Sea appeare
               In all his formes; the waues ſhe to the life
               Deſcribes, and ſet out their tumultuous ſtrife:
               The waters were with purple wrought, the ſhore
               With Emeralds and Pearles all ſhadow'd o're;
               Behold you might the ſedge and greeniſh weed
               Flote from the Rockes (as if they there did breed
               Where ſhe had plac't them) with ſuch Art conceiu'd,
               That warie Pilots well might be deceiu'd
               In viewing them; then forth a different skeine
               Of ſilke ſhe ſorts, and freſh to worke againe
               Begins, thoſe ſands, the brackiſh waters drinke:
               Thoſe ſands, ſo like; that lookers on would thinke
               They heard the Seas hoarſe murmure: laſt of all,
               To th' earth ſhe comes, yet (for th' originall
               Was but a dull piece, and groſſe element)
               Leſſe labour in deſcribing that ſhe ſpent:
               
                  
Only ſome greene and yellow would beſtow

               And (for vartety) amongſt the reſt,
               That of Narciſſus ſtory ſhe expreſt;
               Where (oppoſite) the new transformed Roſe,

               (Theſe Elements thus finiſht to her mind)
               Fiue diff'rent Zones, each in a ſeu'rall kinde
               And quality ſhe notes, a crimſon thred
               The middle woue (flaming all fiery redde
               Inhabitable) on both ſides of that
               She plac't the other two, more temperate:
               The two moſt cold (as needleſſe to be drawne)
               She prettily thus figur'd in the Lawne
               Wherein ſhe work't; (a ſpace there left) and ſo
               The Samplers white alone expreſt their ſnow.

               BY this, the ſable vaile of night, from farre

               Loſt, for ſhe now by Venus was betrayd,

Boldly awakes, forgets all feare or doubt,
               And to the dewy fields ſhe ſallies out;
               Out went ſhe, but no ſooner tripped o're
               The humble threſhold, when her creaking dore,
               VVith turned hinge thrice ſqueak't; as if it meant
               To warne her from the deſperate attempt.
               Thrice it preſag'd, thrice (guilty of her fate)
               The neighbouring Aetna groan'd: but ah, too late!
               For headlong will of woman, now, in her,
               Rebellion nouriſhed' gainſt iuſter feare.
               Out went ſhe, and with her the ſiſters three,
               Thoſe goddeſſes, that bore her companie;
               Firſt iocund Venus hugg'd with her deceit,
               Glad, that the houre for which ſhe long did wait
               Drew neere; but giaddeſt that her pow'rfull skill
               Could draw the pow'rs infernall to her will.
               The ſmooth-comb'd locks, that (on her golden head
               She weares) part (like two skeines) and as in thread
               Intangled, ſome crumples vp: ſo ſhee
               Some longer wore, ſome criſpt and curled bee;
               In a rich purple mantle was ſhe clad,
               O're which, a belt (her ſweating husband had
               Fram'd in his Forge) ſhe caſt, which kept it on,
               Buckled ther'to with a rich Orient ſtone:
               Next Venus march't Licoeus beautious queene:
               She (whom th' Arcadian Swaines full oft haue ſeene

               The other (a bold huntreſſe) loues to fright
               The wildeſt beaſts that tremble at her ſight.
               
                  
Caru'd on a golden Helmet, Pallas bore
               Huge Typhons picture, (whom ſhe long before
               Slew in Ioues quarrell:) Typhons vpper part
               Is dead, the lower liuing; ſo in part
               He liues, part dyes, that monſtrous bulke of his,
               Halfe man, halfe ſerpent, vpward, down-ward is
               In her right hand a mighty ſpeare ſhe wields,
               That tow'rs vp to the sky, no wood that yeelds
               A tree ſo tall; and in her left hand, grac't
               With dazling ſhield was vgly Gorgon plac't,
               Crown'd with a head of ſnakes, whoſe viſage grim
               And killing looke, ſhe with a vaile keepes in.
               
                  Dian appeares in a more mild aſpect,
               More louely, and in euery reſpect
               So like her brother, that each ſiluer ray,
               (Vpon her glorious head) ſhin'd it (by day)
               Were Phoebus ſelfe: whoſe light, whoſe eminence
               She bore (Sex only breeding difference)
               Her azure plumpe vein'd armes diſcouered bare,
               And careleſſe lockes playd with the gentle aire.
               Th'vnbended bowe now gaue her ſinewes reſt,
               And at her backe the ſhafts in quiuer reſt:
               A ſhort looſe garment that ſhe (faſtned) weares
               With double girt, ſcarce from her knee appeares;
               On whoſe light ground (vnmatched to behold)
               The wandring Delos floats in ſeas of gold:
               With theſe, the ioy of Ceres, her deere child,
               But ſoone, neere griefe, keepes equall pace in field,
               Equall in limbes and honour, and might ſeeme
               Either of both; for euery one would deeme
               He ſaw a goddeſſe, and would thinke her ſo,
               Bore ſhe but Pallas ſhield, or Phoebus bowe:
               
                  
Her gather'd garment faſtned with a knot
               By ſmootheſt Iaſper was; and ſhe was not
               Inferior to the Siſters nor their skill,
               For ſhe could couzen Natures ſelfe (at will)
               With art, which neuer happ'lier was ſhowne,
               Then in the rare beſtowing of her combe,
               On thoſe two golden fleeces, that adorne
               Her wel-ſhap't head; where they ſo eu'n were worn
               That not the fineſt thred in loome of Lawne
               Agreed, or could more equally be drawne:
               Th'Imagery in ſilkes ſo liuely wrought
               On her looſe robe, might pleaſe the very thought
               Of nice beholders; who, when they ſhould ſee
               Theſe pictures, and would iudge them but to bee,
               Inanimate dead trunkes, might Proſerpine
               
               Pricke them but tongues, they'd ſpeake and be diuine.
               The bults ſhe workt were of a goddeſſe breed,
               (Reſembling Sunne and Moone Hyperions ſeed)
               But in their ſhapes ſhe faſhion'd different quite,
               Theſe two great Captaines of Aurora 'nd Night:
               Such, as when Thetis (they but tender, young,
               Short breathed Infants) with a Nurſe-like ſong
               Rock't ſleepe into their cradles, and doth take
               To her warme lappe thoſe ſucklings when they wake;
               
                  Tytan, thus weake: (in his minoritie)
               Dimme lighted, and not clamber'd vp ſo high
               (As now) with mounting wing; in which firſt age
               Men faine him mild, and free from ſcorching rage:
               Thus, feeble Tytan, at his Dammes right ſide
               Lay panting; and as often as he cry'd,
               (For wantonneſſe) ſo euer and anon
               It ſobb's, and ſpits a gentle fire, vpon
               
                  
The louing Mother; who to ſtill and reſt,
               Turnes to his ſiſter her left ſide and breſt:
               From whence, and at her Criſtall dugge, ſhe drinks
               That milke-ſweet liquor, whil'ſt her Sire bethinks
               Him of the younglings: and the prettie Moone
               Viewes in the Mothers arme, vnto her ſoone;
               He (ſporting) calls, the wayward babe, that ſhowes
               With one eye turned vpward, that it knowes
               Nought but the dugge and Thetis, all elſe ſcornes,
               Mockes him (kind father) with her little hornes.
               In ſuch great pompe, glitt'ring attire, ſhe went:
               The Naides (on both ſides of her) bent
               In friendly troope, to wait and beare her traine,
               Compaſſe her round, each ſtroue to be moſt faine.
               Thoſe Nymphes Crymniſus, which thy fountaine cleere
               And thine Pantagia (whoſe ſwift courſe doth beare,
               And headlong rowle downe rocks:) do famous make
               That Riuer too from whence Gela doth take
               The Cities name, and they (ſlow Camarine)
               
               Which in thoſe fennie ſhallow lakes of thine
               Are nouriſhed; thoſe that in Cryſtall brooke,
               And ſtreames of Arethuſa, all forſooke
               Their loued homes; and to make full the feaſt
               
                  Alpheus ſends his Nymphes, and 'mongſt the reſt
               That there attend in gratefull companie,
               None did excell the faireſt Cyane.
               
               So Amazones in a triumphant band
               With ſloped ſhields march through the foe-mans land:
               When man-like braue Hyppolita, with ſpoyle
               (From Arcton hill, laden with goods and toyle)
               Retires her ſnowy troopes; then, when they ſweate
               In bloud of yellow Scythians, or beate,
               
                  
And breake with ſharpeſt axe the tougher Ice
               That ſtops the current of ſwift Tanais:
               
               So, the Moeonian Nymphes are wont to riſe
               From Hermus, when their vs'd ſolemnities
               They giue to Bacchus, on whoſe feſtiuall
               Each, ſeuerally, and then, together, all
               Vpon their fathers gold ſwolne bankes run mad,
               Frisking about: the aged riuer (glad)
               Sits in his denne, and as their want he viewes
               VVater in plenty from moiſt vrne renewes;
               No ſooner had flow'r-bearing Aetna ſpi'd,
               And from his hearby top farre off deſcri'd
               The ſacred people; when milde Zepherus
               
               He forceth with entreates, and vrgeth thus:

               Thoſe heau'nly pow'rs, they may be couetous
               To weare our flowry garlands on their browes:
               Here Aetna ſtopt, when ſtraight the Weſt-wind threw
               Shak't (from his madid wings) a Nectar new
               On the dry turfes, and ioines the clefted-earth,

               Where e're he flies a Spring of Aprill ſhow'rs

               In hillockes ſoft, till, farther it becomes
               A hill, where from a liuely punice runs
               
                  
A bubling Spring, which growes into a Brooke,

               To ſee the flowry Country, to exhort,
               Thus, Cytherea, them begins: Come, come,

               The badge of her old griefe, then each doth ſtriue
               And fall to worke; as when of Bees a Hiue
               
                  
Snatches the ſweets of Hyblas Tyme; or when
               Their Leaders with an Army (as 'mongſt men)

               So they made hauocke of the flow'rs, and ſpoile
               Of all their glory, in a moments toyle.

               When in the fountaine that ſelfe-loue was knowne:
               
                  Apollo, with ſad brow thy loſſe laments;
               At thine Cephiſsus broken reed relents:
               
                  Proſerpina, more greedy then the reſt
               (Moſt hot vpon the ſpoile) culs out the beſt,
               And ſtuffes her Oſier baskets full; that ſmile
               To ſee their Miſtris the poore fields beguile
               Of their rich habit; ſhe with garlands crownes
               Her temples (ignorant of fate) that frownes
               Vpon the wreath ſhe weares (propheticall
               Swiftly fore-running the blacke Nuptiall)
               The warlike Goddeſſe, her right hand, that ſcowres
               The luſtie troopes, that teares downe walls and towres,
               
                  
Giues to an eaſier taske; layes by her ſpeare
               Her gliſt'ring ſhield (vnus'd ſuch toyes to beare)
               She teacheth now the garland to embrace,
               Her ſteele-topp't helmet ſweeteſt garlands grace:
               Nor ſhe, that in Parthenian Mountaines ſeekes
               With ſure nos'd ſenters after chaſe, diſlikes
               The ſport, but her licentious lockes keepes downe,
               And bridles them with a faire garland crowne:
               Whil'ſt thus the ſcatter'd Virgins pull the flow'rs,
               Behold a noyſe 'gan bellow, as if two tow'rs
               (Falling) had ruſh't together, or ſome Towne
               From it's foundations firme had bin caſt downe,
               The cauſe none geſt, but Paphos goddeſſe: ſhe
               Was preinſtructed in the myſtery,
               And had this double paſſion at her choyſe
               To feare with them, but inwardly reioice:
               And now the rector of the damn'd, below;
               Through ſecret windings buſtles to and fro,
               To find a way to earth: firſt doth he fetch
               A compaſſe here and there; then makes a breach
               Aloft; his foggy Courſers trample on
               
                  Enceladus, that with their weight doth groane,
               (The Gyants huge vaſte limbes cut by their wheeles)
               Addes to the former torments that he feeles;
               And lab'ring, with a double yoke, in paine:
               (For he beares Dis and Aetna now) would faine
               Finde eaſe; the wearie Serpents (clinging) ſtay
               Their axletree, the horſes force their way,
               And ſcudde along (too ſwift for them too ſlacke)
               Their fiery wheeles ſlide from his ſulph'rous backe.
               And as the cloſe beſieger, by degrees
               Steales on his mu'd vp foe, that nought foreſees,
               
                  
VVhil'ſt he (by a laborious countermine

               (The Conqu'rours entring, where they leaſt expect)
               Like to theſe earth-borne men. Saturnes third heire
               Contriues a paſſage vp to the VVorld's aire
               His brothers Orbe, and giues his Steeds free reine
               Searcheth through eu'ry corner: but (in vaine)
               No gate appeares, huge heapes of rokces and ſtones
               Damme vp his paſſage eu'ry where; not once
               Diſcou'ring light, as purpoſely to keepe

               But he (enrag'd) brook't no delayes, and ſtraight

               And Riuers rore; th'adiacent Iſlands ſhake,

               The poore cold dweller on ſteepe Appenine,
               
               And frozen paſſengers, that ſlowly climbe
               The hoary Alpes, amazed ſtand, and doubt
               Of ſome new broile 'twixt Ioue and Gyant rowt:
               Thoſe that (along thy ſtreames) with naked limbe

               So when (on lower Plaines of Theſsalie)
               
               A ſtanding poole (by rockie Mountaines high
               Inclos'd) denies vnto the mariſh ground
               Tillage; and paſture to the medowes drown'd;
               
                  
Till angry Neptune with his Tridents pikes,
               Pierceth high Oſſa, and cold Olympus ſtrikes;
               Whoſe wounded ſides open a paſſage wide,
               At which th'impriſon'd waters (loos'ned) ſlide,

               Reſtored are, vnto the Husbandman.
               No ſooner was Earths knotty vaile vndone
               (By Pluto) when Trinacria begun
               To ſpread her large and op'ning wombe; and now
               A ſuddaine fright, vpon the pallid brow
               Of heau'n appeares; the ſtars vnus'd to ſtray
               From their firſt courſe, ſeeke an vncertaine way:
               The two celeſtiall Beares that ſhone ſo bright
               In the forbidden Sea daſh their dimme light.
               Lazy Boötes feare doth headlong caſt,
               
                  Orion trembles, Atlas ſtands aghaſt
               At hels Iades neighing, whoſe breath, miſty ſteams
               Obſcure heau'ns face, and Phoebus golden beams;
               His radiant brightneſſe in the beaſts doth breed
               A ſuddaine terror, for they vſe to feed
               Perpetually in darkneſſe: now by fits,
               Betwixt their teeth they catch the champed bits,
               And (winding ſidelong) their Coach beame would turne
               Backward to hell, and Chaos to returne.
               But when they once the Tarry whip perceiue
               Laſh their blacke buttockes, quickly then they leaue
               Their ſtrife; and (forc't to the new light) depart
               Swifter then winter floud, or Parthian dart:
               The violence of Southerne ſtormes is ſlowe
               To their quicke pace, that nimbleſt thoughts outgoe:
               The reines grow hot with their ranke bloud, and breath
               From fornace of their noſtrils ſends pale death
               
                  
Into the purer ayre: their froth, vpon
               Th'vntroden ſands leaues ſtrong infection.
               The Nymphs all fled, ſaue Proſerpine; (who caught
               And ſnatcht into the Chariot) beſought
               The goddeſſes with ſcreaking loud for ayde;
               
                  Pallas that viewes her (how ſhe was betrayd)
               Diſcouers Gorgons viſage; Delta too
               To her reliefe haſtens the horne-bent bowe:
               Nor giue they way vnto their Vncle, for
               Ioint Charitie incites them to this warre,
               Virginity in them and Proſerpine
               
               (Alike) exaſperates the fault and crime
               Of the bold rauiſher; he keepes his way
               (Feareleſſe:) as when the Lion makes a prey
               On ſome young Steere the beauty of the ſtall
               And herd, when with his pawes beſmeared all
               In bloud, he diues into the naked breſt
               Vntill his rau'nous hunger there ſuppreſt,
               Quarters out more, at length his appetite
               Quite ſlak't (with ſtaring gaze that would affright)
               He careleſſe ſtands, ſhaking his knotted maine
               (As if the Herdſmans threats hee did diſdaine.)
               Thou ruler of the ſluggiſh Orbe, thou worſt

Vpon our Globe? She thus exclaimes, and wounds
               The horn-hoof'd ſteeds (making them keep their bounds
               With her oppoſed ſhield) they ſtoppe, and ſhee

               Vnbends, but addes theſe words vnto her woe.
               Be mindfull (ah farewell) the iuſt reſpect

               Like puniſhment my vengeance ſhall vnſheath

               The ſtarres were ſhak't, and ſeate whereon he ſate.
               And now the apparitions of blacke night,
               And fearefull miſchiefe Ceres do affright:
               Who (abſent from this Synode, and ſecure)
               To her ſtill thought could ſweeteſt reſt procure;
               But now each moment doth ingeminate

               Of Ceres, her vext ſoule in cares doth ſteepe.
               So ſtill ſhe groanes in night, and when day comes,
               Cold wonderment her ſtupid ſence benummes,
               Till next night's fantaſies, in which; a dart,

               Cut from the root, and by ſtrange cruelties
               Of art, the boughes lopt off; boughes, that abouud
               In freſhneſſe, now ly wither'd on the ground,
               And (as ſhe thought) of this great wickedneſſe

               At length, all circumſtances, all diſguiſe
               Vnmask'd, poore Ceres her ill fortune ſpies
               In her owne child, that now her ſelfe appeares

               She puts away, and on her, new griefe takes;
               For Proſerpine appear'd, as if ſhe ſeem'd
               Shut in cloſe priſon, and her mother deem'd

               What fault? what puniſhments are theſe? what face?

               Is this? (ſhe addes:) who thus hath pow'r (ſhe cries)
               Hath pow'r thus much on vs to tyrannize?
               Why beareſt thou theſe bonds, this chaine, vnfit

               Could'ſt thou (more cruell then the Lyons) whom

               Deferre; and me that was thine only deare,
               So long forget, was I deſpis'd? then heare
               A dolefull truth, that name of Proſerpine
               
               So ſweet to thee; ſo lou'd, ſo only thine,
               Only that name remaines: for, ſee, behold
               VVhat puniſhment, what bonds do me infold:
               But (cruell) thou in vprore with a ſong

               To me art witleſſe; yet, if mothers breſt
               Haue not quite leſt thee: if thou yet, it bleſt
               And holy Ceres bear'ſt the name, let me
               Begge one boone at thy hands (my liberty:)
               Carry me vp againe, but if too late
               I ſtriue 'gainſt Ioue, and my prefixed fate:
               
                  
If backe I neuer muſt returne; yet thou,
               At leaſt, with comfortable viſit now
               Come ſee mee: thus ſhe ſpake, and going about
               To ſtretch her hands, ſhe could not hold them out,

               But ſorry for the want of her belou'd;
               Vp ſtraight ſhe gets in a diſtracted mood,
               And to Cybele doth her griefes vnloade:
               No longer (ſacred Parent) can I ſtay
               In Phrigian ground; the care calls me away
               Of deareſt child, ſhe's yet a Girle and young,

               Her tender yeeres vnto all hazard yet
               Doe her expoſe, nor do thoſe buildings great
               And truſtie, of the Cyclops, me aſſure:
               Each blaſt of fame, doth make me leſſe ſecure
               Of ſafety (leſt ſhe to the gods reueale

               Of Aetna, and Enceladus deepe groanes
               Cannot be hid, nor ſilenced his moanes.
               My boading dreames in ſundry vncouth formes
               Preſage, and eu'ry dreame ſends freſh alar'mes
               Of doubts vnto me, my Propheticke thought
               Still threatens, and hath ſtill vpon me wrought.
               As often as the crowne of golden eares
               Falls from my head of't ſelfe, vp get my feares
               As oft, and ſtirre the bloud that on my breſt
               Stands in a ſweat, whil'ſt I (perplext) no reſt
               
                  
Can take: then on a ſuddaine doe ariſe
               Two ſtreames, that breake from my vnwilling eyes,
               My rebell hand doth beate my trembling heart,
               VVhen I would touch my pipe (it ſeemes) all Art
               And ſweetneſſe failes; that nothing doth remaine
               But the dead ſound, and (being in this vaine)
               My Tymbrel's ſtrokes, nought but ſad ſounds forth ſend;
               All things (I feare) my griefes to come portend:
               Delay is dangerous, ſuch words (replyes
               
                  Cybele) may they fruſtrate mount the skies;
               
                  Ioue's not ſo ſlacke: but (to her lateſt end)
               VVith thunder, will be ready to defend
               His pledge; but thou thy iourney onward haſte,
               And backe returne, when thy falſe feare's ore'paſt:
               
                  Ceres takes leaue, the Temple leaues, and ſet

               Are dull and lazy, with her laſh that rings
               In th'ayre, belabours their alternate wings:
               Tow'rd Sicilie ſhe driues amaine, and ſcant
               O're Ida, but deſpaires, ſuſpects her want.
               As a poore bird (of tender young bereft,
               VVho to ſome tree or lower hedge were left,
               Whil'ſt ſhe prepar'd them food; euer from whence
               Her flight ſhe takes, a kind of troubled ſence,
               Tender remorſe ſhe hath: firſt, leſt the wind
               Her neſt blowe downe; next, leſt ſhe empty find
               The ſame (to men or Snakes a prey) ſo ſhe,
               So Ceres, when ſhe ſaw the cuſtodie
               Faile, and the watch-folke of her houſe all gone,
               The poſtes broke vp, hinges caſt downe, vpon
               Her out-roomes deſolate; with ſuch a ſight
               And vnexpected change, all in a fright
               
                  
Her clothes ſhe rent, and from her ſoft haire teares
               The ſprigges and it; this madneſſe dry'd her teares,
               Nor had ſhe breath to ſpeake; but hauing ſpent
               VVith trembling, all her ſpirits (as ſhe went
               Forward) the firſt ſtep was a ſtumble ſtill,
               Yet on ſhe goes, and with a madding will
               VVanders about, to view theſe emptie roomes:
               (As ſhe from one into another comes)
               On a diſorder'd frame at length ſhe lights,
               The worker well ſhe knew, but poorely ſlights
               Th'imperfect piece, for (the diuine worke, ſpy'd)
               She found, that the bold Spider had ſupply'd
               VVith ſacrilegious webbe, that emptie ſpace:
               Yet ſhe nor wept, nor grieu'd; but kiſt the place
               And cloth vnfiniſhed, vpon thoſe threds
               She ſpends her dumbe complaints, and thinks ſhe reades
               Her daughter, on thoſe faces: eu'ry toy
               About the ſcatter'd roomes, doth ſhe enjoy
               And hugge for Proſerpine: now the chaſt couch
               And forlorne bed inuites her to approach,
               Which ſluttiſhly (vnmade) ſeemes to complaine
               For want of the ſoft waight it did ſuſtaine.
               Amaz'd ſhe ſtands, (ſtrook dumbe, in ſuch diſtreſſe
               Like a poore Swaine, or ſimple Shepheardeſſe,
               (Whoſe flocke, whil'ſt ſhe was farre from their reliefe
               To Africke Lyons rage, or cunning thiefe,
               Expos'd) too late can ſhe returne, and calls
               The beaſts (in vaine) within their hurdle walls;
               So Ceres: and in th'vtmoſt roome ſhe ſpy'd
               
                  Electra, Nurſe vnto her child, a tride
               Seruant of hers; and of the Ocean
               The moſt knowne ancient Nymph (from whence ſhee came.
               
                  
Like Ceres ſelfe, in goodneſſe; this was ſhe
               That Proſerpine from tender infancie
               Bore at her breſt; and, till ſhe went alone,
               Was vs'd for ſport, Ioues thigh to ſet her on.
               This her Companion was, her Guard ſelect,
               Whom (next her Mother) ſhe would moſt reſpect.
               When her thus Ceres found, rob'd of her truſt,
               With hoarie lockes now ſcatter'd in the duſt,
               (After a volley of loud ſighes) the reines
               To griefe ſhe looſens, and breathes out her paines:
               VVhat ſacke is this (ſaid ſhe?) And are we giu'n
               A prey to Titans hoaſt? Reignes Ioue in Heau'n?
               (The Thund'rer liuing) who durſt be ſo bold?
               VVho durſt commit this outrage, vncontrol'd?
               
                  Typhoeus, Alcyoneus, haue theſe
               Broke from the Mountaines, giu'n their yoakt-necks eaſe?
               Or hath my neighbour Aetna, Enceladus
               
               Freed? Or my houſehold gods, Briareus
               
               And ſeat deſtroy'd? Ah, where art thou (my Deare)
               Thoſe handmaids that attended on thee, where?
               VVhere, where is Cyane? what violence,
               My chanting Syrens, hath remou'd you hence?
               Is this your faith? is this your loyaltie,
               To keepe anothers Pledge from danger free?
               The poore Nurſe trembled, and her griefe gaue place
               To ſtronger feare; not to haue ſeene the face
               Of wofull Ceres, ſhe would gladly'haue dy'de:
               Senceleſſe, amaz'd, a while ſhe doth abide,
               (As loth the doubtfull miſchiefe to diſcloſe)
               Vntill at length, diſpenſing with her woes
               And paſſions, thus ſhe ſpake: I would the mad
               And raging Armie of the Gyants had
               
                  
Beene actors in this miſchiefe; common things
               Doe leſſe affect vs, ſorrow that moſt wrings
               Is that which by our neereſt friends is ſought,
               And ſuch is thine, for goddeſſes haue wrought,
               Conſpir'd thy ruine, nay (which leaſt of all
               Thou migh'tſt ſuſpect) ſiſters, did cauſe our fall:
               The trech'rous gods and woundes here behold
               Ofenui'ous kindred, that their bloods haue ſold.
               
                  Phlegra 'gainſt heau'n was ne're ſo furious,
               As heau'n 'gainſt thee (all vnpropitious)
               Thy houſe a happy quiet did poſſeſſe,
               While the chaſte Virgin neuer would expreſſe
               A thought of gadding, or ſcarce once beſtowe
               Her dainty foote (one only ſtep to goe
               Ouer the threſhold) neither durſt ſhe make
               A ſally to the fields, freſh ayre to take.
               So ſtrict ſhe was to thy commands, ſo bent
               To herlou'd worke: at which (though tyr'd and ſpent)
               All the delight and ſolace ſhe deſir'd
               Was, from her Syrens ſongs and notes admir'd.
               I was her boſome friend, ſhe would impart
               To me, the ioyes or ſorrowes of her heart;
               I was her bed-fellow, and to each ſport
               (As a companion ſhould I ſtill reſort:)
               Thus paſt we fairely on, till Venus came
               Drawne hither (doubtfull) by what blaſt of fame;
               And that ſhe might the leſſe ſuſpected be,
               
                  Phoebe and Pallas are her companie:
               With cunning ſmiles, and fain'd embraces ſoft
               She often hugges thy daughter, and as oft
               The name of ſiſter iterates; complaines,
               On her hard Mother: that ſo much reſtraines
               
                  
Her, from wiſht libertie; and thinkes it ſtrange
               That thou abroad ſo farre from home could'ſt range,
               And leaue her in this ſolitarie place;
               Farre from her fathers kingdome, that the face
               Of heauen ſcarce ſhe ſees: and (that which moſt
               Doth pittie moue, her conuerſation loſt
               With kindred gods) the ſimple Mayd gaue care
               (Caught by this wily chat, and free from feare)
               The goddeſſes ſhe makes her welcome gheſts,
               Whom, with quaint cates and Nectar ſtore ſhe feaſts:
               The banquet done in ſport and merriment
               She wore Diana's robe, and her bowe bent
               With tender finger drew; and ſought to wield
               
                  Minerua's golden head-piece, and huge ſhield:
               But Venus, ſtraight, deceitfully' gan prayſe
               
                  Aetna's high top, and to the skies to rayſe
               The Vallies flow'rs, and ſomething her admir'd,
               Of which, ſhe wittingly, witleſſe enquir'd:
               She could not thinke, or eaſily beleeue
               The Roſe, from all thoſe froſts preſeru'd, ſhould liue:
               Or that the colder Months ſhould there retaine
               The Summers graſſe, all winter to remaine;
               Nor, that the tender bloſſomes of the Spring
               Are nip't, by ang'ry Bootes bluſtering:
               (Thus prayſing and thus doubting) with deſire
               To ſee the place, her breſt was ſet on fire;
               Thy tender Virgins fraile, vnwary yeeres
               Made her conſent to goe, t'encreaſe my feares.
               What teares ſpent I, to hinder her (in vaine?)
               How little did my'ntreaties (fruitleſſe) gaine
               From her? that (now reſolu'd and confident)
               In ſiſters guard (together with them went?)
               
                  
And (a large traine of Nymphs t'attend them ſeene
               Vnto the Medowes cloth'd in laſting greene)
               With the firſt morning light, when as the field
               Yet chill with dewe, heau'ns liquid iuice doth yeeld
               To banke of Violets; they gather'd there
               The moyſt'ned flow'rs, that, with perle drops appeare:
               But when the Sunne grew to the mid-dayes height,
               The Pole was ceaz'd on, by vnlook't-for night:
               The trembling Iſland then began to reele
               And nod (ſhak't by the noyſe of Chariot wheele,
               Of horſes neighing) nor could it appeare
               (Whether the Coach-man Deaths fore-runner were,
               Or death her ſelfe:) the graſſe and riuers great
               Were dri'd, the fields, ſtraight burnt with parching heat:
               All things were blaſted; there, the Priuet white
               We ſawe, the Roſe and Lilly alter'd quite
               From natiue ſent and colour: eu'ry flow'r
               The peſtilent contagion blaſteth o're:
               And (as the hoarſe fell ſteerſ-man turn'd againe,
               With horrid out-cries of each beaſt the raine)
               Backe with the hell-blacke Chariot returnes night,
               And to the World the day-reſtored light
               Diſcouers our ſad loſſe and heauineſſe:
               For now no Proſerpine, nor goddeſſes
               Were ſeene; for ſhe deare ſoule was rapt away,
               And they (that act performed) made no ſtay:
               Poore Cyane vpon the Meddow ground
               Strooke dead, with cold amazement next we found;
               And (as ſhe lay) the garland from her browe.
               We tooke, whoſe freſher flow'rs were wither'd now
               VVith the hot ſteame: there each of vs enquires,
               And of our Miſtris hap to know deſires
               
                  
Of her (who neereſt was to the ſucceſſe)
               Each of vs with vncertaine doubtfulneſſe
               Demands the colour of the Steeds, and who
               The Coach-man was; but ſhe (that melts in woe)
               Nothing replyes, of nothing vs reſolues:
               But (metamorphos'd) ſecretly diſſolues
               Her ſelfe into a Fountaine; that ſoft haire
               Vpon her head, her feet new turned are
               Into a dew; thoſe armes diffuſed growe
               In ſtreams, that (following our foot-ſteps) o're-flow.
               The reſt fled, and our Mer-mayds with ſwift wing
               Trudge to Pelorus, and (for griefe) to ſing,
               Since, ceaſe: and now (in ſtead of melody)
               Plagues they portend, and dire mortality;
               And their ſoft voices now ſerue but t'entice
               Th'vnheedy Mariner, that in a trice
               (Anſw'ring their calls) finds his vnhappy end;
               Of all thy ſeruants, I alone t'attend
               Thy ſorrowes liue: Ceres in deepe ſuſpence,

               Was paſt, and ſtill to come; but by and by
               That moode ſhe changeth, and (with fi'ry eye
               Turn'd in her head, her breſt enrag'd) aboue
               Vp to the gods ſhe flings (with plaints to moue)
               As a fierce Tygreſſe, when her den's forlorne
               Of tender young, (by fearefull horſe-man borne
               To Perſian king, madding) out ſtrips the wind;
               (Diſperſing all her rage, and fury blind
               In ſhining ſpots:) at length ſhe ouertakes
               The Hunter, and with yawning wide mouth makes
               Him leaue his prey; but in a ſhape of glaſſe
               He coozens the poore beaſt, and ſafe doth paſſe
               
                  
Onward his way: th'enraged Mother thus
               Throughout all heauen ſtormes: reſtore to vs
               Reſtore, ſh'exclaimes; we are no wandring brood
               Of ſome baſe Riuer, nor Plebeian blood
               Of Driades flowes from vs; Saturne high
               Begot me on the tow'ry Cybele:
               
               Where is the priuiledge of gods then? where

               What bootes a vertuous life, or what? the faire
               Title of good, if Cytherea dare,
               If ſhameleſſe ſhe preſume to ſhew that face

               That wholſome ſleep, the couch, thoſe twynings chaſte
               Of her and Mars, made her thus bold at laſt

               Such deeds, and ſuch baſe actions from her flowe:
               But what? are you turn'd Pandoreſses, your;
               
                  Dian and Pallas, that yet neuer knew
               What luſt meant? Is your mayden honour gone?
               Are your vowes chang'd, that thus you waited on
               
                  Venus and her bolde Ruffian? (ſuffice:)
               You both deſeru'd the bloudy ſacrifice
               Of thirſty Scythian altar: let me know
               The reaſon of your rage; what mou'd you ſo
               'Gainſt Proſerpine? did ſhe in word or thought
               Offend you euer, had ſhe euer ſought
               Texpell thee, Delia, from thy groues? or e're

               Oh no: Trinacria was her loued home,

But what auail'd ſuch priuacie? no day,

               Pardon (quoth ſhee) yee deities, if loue,

The goddeſſes (at theſe freſh plaint's) no pow'r

               The vtmoſt limits will I prye throughout,
               Of Southerne winde, and (for a further proofe)
               Will viſit Boreas in his ſnowie roofe:
               Then, will I tread on Atlas in the Weſt;

Thus ſpoke ſhe, and from off the lofty top
               Of her knowne Aetna downeward ſlid, to lop
               The branches from thoſe trees that muſt giue light,

               The trees grew thick here; their intangled boughs
               On eu'ry ſide ſhadow high Aetna's browes;
               Thither brought Iupiter the captiu'd prey
               Which, he (long ſince) had got in Gyant frey:
               The wood grew proud of that Phlegraean broile,
               And victorie, cloath'd eu'ry tree with ſpoile;
               Here, the vaſt iawes, and each prodigious limbe

               This, of Aegeons hundred hands, the ſteele,
               (Whoſe waight her crooked branches bent:) did feele
               That Caeus Armes, this ſhield of Mimas wore,

               And laſt, a Firre tree (taller then the reſt,

               The ſmoakie Trophies of Enceladus
               
               Their king, did load: the waight (ſo ponderous)

               (Did not a ſtrong Oake prop with neere ſupplie:
               
                  
So ſacred was the feare and piety
               To this moſt memorable groue, that free
               From leaſt offence, the heauenly Trophies hung;
               Nor durſt rude ſhepheards ruſtick pipe and ſong

               This place, he from the ſacred ſhadow flyes.
               But neither deity, nor reuerence

               She lookes vpon her handy-worke, and viewes
               The mangled bodies (which of them to chuſe

So equall in their height, and boughs eſteem'd,

               Her armes ſhe tuck't, then folded vp her skirt:
               Next, with ſharpe axe, ſhe hewes alternately
               The two, (that on the ground ſtraight grouelingly
               Alike, they ſuffer'd in their fall) alike,

               The deadly lights, that with his flames were typ't:

               Did ſhine, and ſulphure mixt (that to them cleaues)
               Made the boughs crackle, and high Aetna raiſe

               But Lacheſis (that makes no difference

               (Whil'ſt thou my glory wer't, thy Mothers pride:)

               'Twas I, 'twas cruell I; now I diſcloſe

               Where ſhall I ſeeke thee, in which heauen aboue?
               Vnder what Clymate here, on earth do'ſt moue?
               What guide, what tracke ſhall leade me? (might I know

               Where the damn'd thiefe doth liue, in earth or ſeas?)
               The print of the ſwift wheeles my ſight would pleaſe.
               I goe, I goe, where my faint plants ſhall guide,
               Whether blind chance: ſorrow, like this betide

               Shall it be lawfull, will ſome Deſtinie
               Giue way (my child) that once more I may ſee,
               Once more embrace thee? doth that beauty reigne

               Or ſhall I hap (vnhappy) to behold
               Thee ſuch, as night and dreams haue oft foretold?
               Thus ſayd ſhe; and the firſt ſtep ſhe aduanc't

               Thoſe, and the place (made priuie to the rape:)
               Then (through confus'd pathes) ſhe her courſe doth ſhape,
               Pryes through the fields with blazing light, and lowe
               Sh'inclines the brands (all comfortleſſe) in woe,
               With teares ſhe bathes her cheekes: teares, that abound;
               (Producing ſighes and groanes, that with their ſound
               Ring in th'ayre and woods) the flaming light
               Now ſpreds on farre, whoſe ſhadow in calme night
               Swimmes on the Seas; the blaze of it doth flie
               To Lybian coaſt, and bankes of Italy;
               Th' Etruſcan ſhore was bright and cleerly ſeene,
               And (from th' inflamed Seas) the Sirtes ſhine.
               Next vnto Scilla's dennes ſhe goes, the light
