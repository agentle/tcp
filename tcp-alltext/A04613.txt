                  YOUR great loue and fauour Honorable Syr, euer manifested to all worthy Sciences, hath imboldened me to offer vppe at your Lordships Shryne, these the vnworthie labours of my musicall trauels. And though in respect of their weakenes, they may perhaps seeme vntimely brought forth, and therefore the vnlikelier to prosper; yet doubt I not but if tenderd by you, they shall happelie find gentle cherishing, which may be a meane to make them more stronger, or else miscarrying, to encourage my endeuours to beget a better: for as no arts wincks at fewer errors than musicke: so none greater enimies to their owne profession then musicians; who whilst in their own singularitie, they condemne euery mans workes, as some waie faulty, they are the cause, the art is the lesse esteemed, and they themselues reputed as selfe-commenders, and men most fantasticall. Wherefore if this one censuring infirmitie were remoued, these my ayres (free I dare say from grosse errours) would finde euery where more gratious entertainement. But since euen those, who are best seene in this art, cannot vaunt themselues free from such detractours, I the lesse regard it being so well accompanied. Howsoeuer if herein I may gaine your Honors good allowance, I shall thinke I have attained to the better ende of my labours (which with my self, and the best of my seruice) restes euer more at your Lordships imploiment.

               TO THE READER
            
            
               
                  GENTLEMEN, since my desire is your eares shoulde be my indifferent iudges, I cannot thinke it necessary to make my trauels, or my bringing vp arguments to perswade you that I haue a good opinion of my selfe, only thus much will I saie: That I may preuent the rash iudgments of such as know me not. Euer since I practised speaking, I haue practised singing; hauing had noe other qualitie to hinder me from the perfect knowledge of this faculty, I haue been incouraged by the warrant of diuers good iudgments, that my paines herein shall at the least procure good liking, if not delight, which yet for mine owne part I must needes feare as much as I desire, especially when I consider the ripenes of this industrious age, wherein all men endeuour to knowe all thinges, I confesse I was not vnwilling to embrace the conceits of such gentlemen as were earnest to haue me apparel these ditties for them; which though they intended for their priuate recreation, neuer meaning they should come into the light, were yet content vpon intreaty to make the incouragements of this my first adventure, whereuppon I was almost glad to make my small skill knowne to the world: presuming that if my cunning failed me in the Musicke: yet the words might speake for themselues, howsoeuer it pleaseth them to account better of that, then of those. Of purpose (as it should seeme) to make me belieue I can do something; my only hope is, that seeing neither my cold ayres, not their idle ditties (as they will needes haue me call them) have hitherto beene sounded in the eares of manie: they maie chance to finde such entertainment, as commonlie newes doth in the world: which if I may be so happie to beare, I will not saie my next shall be better, but I will promise to take more paines to shew more points of musicke, which now I could not do, because my chiefest care was to fit the Note to the Word, till when, I must be as well content with each mans lawfull censure, as I shall be glad of some mens vndeserued favours.

                  And now she sweares I did, but what,
                  Nay, nay, I must not tell you that:
                  And yet I will it is so sweete,
                  As teehee tahha when louers meete.

                  But shee alas is angrie still,
                  Which sheweth but a womans will:
                  She bites the lippe and cries fie fie,
                  And kissing sweetly away shee doth flie.
