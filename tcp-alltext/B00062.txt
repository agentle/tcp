                  When raging louts with feble braines,
               moſte wilfully wyl ſpend awaye:
               And eke cōſume more thē their gaines,
               in riotyng al the longe day.
               And ſpend with him that wil ſpend moſte:
               yet of their gaine they need not boſte.
            
            
               When drunken Drunkerds will not ſpare,
               the Alehous daily for to plye:
               But ſit and tipple there full ſquare,
               and to their gaines wil haue no eye.
               Nor will not ceaſe I warrant ye:
               ſo long as they haue one penny.
            
            
               When rufling roiſters wil beſtowe,
               vpon thir backs ſuche fine aray:
               And be not wurth that whiche they owe,
               falling therby in to decay.
               Yet wil they ſet theron a face:
               and bragge and crake it out a pace.
            
            
               When liuely lads wil plye the dice,
               conſuming there away their good:
               No man wil count them to be wice,
               but rather to be mad or wood.
               For when that all their money is gone:
               then are they dreſſed like a mome.
            
            
               When laſie loiterers will not wurk:
               and honeſtly their liuings get:
               But had rather in corners lurk,
               then that they wold with labor ſwet.
               Therfore no welth they can attain:
               but liue in trouble and in pain.
            
            
               When doting doltes wil enterpriſe,
               to wurk ſuche feates as I haue tolde:
               Not ceaſſing for to exerciſe,
               worſe deeds then thoſe wt courage bold.
               Then ſome do lay their cotes to gage:
               til that they haue receiued their wage.
            
            
               Then ſome the Counter oft doo kiſſe,
               if that the money be not paid:
               Or if that they their day doo miſſe,
               for whiche to gage their Cote was laid.
               Yet wil they not by this take heed:
               but ſtil continew to proceed.
            
            
               Then ſome therby their credit loſe
               ſo that no wiſe man wil them truſt:
               Wherfore they can no lenger gloſe,
               but rub and reuel not they muſt.
               For wherſoeuer they become:
               they are not ſo wel truſt as knowne.
            
            
               Then ſome at length do beg their bread,
               who if in time they had been wiſe:
               Might wel haue had inough to fed,
               them ſelues, their childrē & their wiues:
               But when that all is gone and ſpent:
               it is to late then to repent.
            
            
               Then ſome to pilfer doo begin,
               but aſſone as they be eſpied:
               With whips they are laid on the ſkin,
               at a carts ars being wel tied.
               But al this can not thoſe amend:
               that wil doo miſchefe to the end.
            
            
               Then ſome proceed to rob and kyl,
               counting al fiſh that comes to net:
               And yf that they might haue their wil,
               for right or wrong they wuld not let.
               Til at the they laſt fall in bands:
               and can not eſcape out of hands.
            
            
               Then ſome at Newgate doo take ſhip,
               ſailing ful faſt vp holborne hil:
               And at Tiborn their anckers piche,
               ful ſore in deed againſt their wil.
               But then it is to late I ſay:
               to cal againe the yeſterday.
            
            
               Wherfore al ye that vſe this trade,
               leaue of betimes yf ye be wiſe:
               Leſt that perchaunce this way ye wade,
               ful ſore againſt your owne deuiſe.
               For heer ye ſee the end of ſuche:
               as litle haue and wil ſpend muche.
