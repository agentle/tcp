      
         
            
            
            A most excellent Ditty, called Collins Conceit.
            To the tune of Wigmores Galiard.
            
            
               COnceits of sundry sorts there are,
               but this Conceit of mine,
               Doth wish all men to haue a care,
               to liue by wisdomes line.
               In my conceit if men would looke,
               where sacred vertues dwell.
               And liue according to Gods Booke,
               then all things should be well.
            
            
               If wisedome were once made our guide,
               she would direct vs right,
               Where now we daily slip aside,
               for want of wisdomes light.
               If we had faith, we néed not feare
               the Deuill nor powers of Hell:
               If godly faith our Anchor were,
               then all things should be well.
            
            
               If we could learne to loue the Lord,
               with an vnfayned loue,
               And willingly obey his Word,
               as duty doth vs moue:
               If we would leaue our wickednesse,
               wherein we doe excell,
               And giue our mindes to godlines,
               then all things should be well.
            
            
               If people did not goe to Church,
               onely for fashion sake:
               If one would not another lurch,
               
                  nor yet had courses take:
               If all those that seeme so pure,
               would not by false weights sell,
               But iustly deale, we might be sure
               that all things should be well.
            
            
               If men would not, to purchase gain,
               falsly themselues forsweare.
               Nor take the name of God in vaine,
               but liue in dread and feare:
               If all hypocrisie were left,
               which daily doth excell:
               If me were not of zeale bereft,
               then all things should be well.
            
            
               If conscience were not ouerstrai'nd,
               for to oppresse the weake:
               If subtill mates were not maintai'nd,
               if none would promise breake:
               If spitefull men did not delight,
               in wrangling uites to dwell:
               If one kept not anothers wife,
               then all things should be well.
            
            
               If no man would false witnesse bear
               for lucre or for loue:
               If no contentious people were
               disquiet for to moue:
               If none would hurt the innocent,
               
                  nor

               Anothers life, twere time well spent,
               then all things should be well.
            
            
               If bloody murthering would cease,
               which doth for vengeance cry:
               If euery man would séeke for peace
               and liue contentedly:
               If drunkennesse and gluttony,
               that doth so much excell:
               If none would practise cruelty,
               then all things should be well.
            
            
               If Parents would instruction vse,
               and youth in time correct:
               Would youth good counsell note rfuse
               
               but thereto haue respect:
               If seruants were obedient
               to those with whome they dwell
               If they were quicke and diligent,
               then all things sh
                     •
                  uld be well.
            
            
               If fornication were not vs'd,
               nor foule adultery:
               In euery place were bribes refus'd,
               and partiality:
               If no man would his neighbor wrong
               which far or neere him dwell,
               Nor stain their credits with his toūg,
               then all things should be well.
            
            
               If scolding queanes were punished,
               did witches hang or burne:
               If bawds and whores not suffered,
               some had a blessed turne:
               If we did not delight to sit
               in sins darke shadow Cell:
               If godly wisedome gouernd wit,
               then all things should be well.
            
            
               If crafty heads wold once g
                     •
                   scant,
               which scrape and claw for gaine,
               The poore and needy soules that want
               would not so much complaine.
               If trust might lye safe in his bed,
               If truth might buy and sell,
               If double dealing once were dead,
               then all things should be well.
            
            
               If cunning Cutpurses and théeues,
               were cleane out of the way,
               Then some false knaues that true men grieue
               should not remaine this day.
               If swearing were once out of vre,
               that none of oathes could tell:
               If lyes were lost, we might be sure,
               that all things would be well.
            
            
               If carry-tales, that bréed debate,
               were hid from Man and Wife:
               Then surely each man with his mate,
               might lead a quiet life:
               If neighbors would like friends agrée
               and loue among vs dwell:
               If pride might once expelled be,
               then all things should be well.
            
            
               If Landlords would leaue racking rent,
               if Vsurie would cease:
               If we had not great male-content,
               this Land might liue in peace.
               If Iustice would not swerue at all,
               if malice would not swell:
               Might high aspiring climbers fall,
               then all things should be well.
            
            
               If rash and hasty people would
               to patience giue place:
               If wrath were left, a number would
               not be so void of grace:
               If hatred were abandoned,
               were enuie driuen to hell:
               If Idelnesse were punished,
               then all things should be well
            
            
               If déeds of charity were vs'd.
               if poore men were not proud,
               If Officers were not abus'd,
               if dice were not allow'd:
               If Lawyers would not suits prolong,
               but to their Clients tell
               
                  How cases stand, if right or wrong,
               then all things should be well.
            
            
               If flattering pick-thanks were expeld
               out of the Common-wealth:
               If men a moderate dyet hold,
               they might liue long in health:
               If hel-bred couetousnesse and pride
               did not amongst vs dwell:
               If rich men were not mercilesse,

               which doe in prison lye:
               If sick
