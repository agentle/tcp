               Two others that the like had done in ſight,
               Wiſht that Gods Iudgement might vpon thē light,

               That did the like, and did her ſelfe forſweare,
               Which ſore example let each Chriſtian heare.

               Hath wrought her ſhame, & all her friends diſgrac't,

               When things were miſt, ſhe did deny the ſame,
               And with great impudence, deuoyd of ſhame,
               Wiſht before God and men that ſhe might rot,
               It that ſuch things ſhe euer ſaw or got.
