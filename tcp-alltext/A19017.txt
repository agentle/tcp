                  Man.
                  NOw in the Garden
                  are we well met,
                  To craue our promise,
                  for promise is a debt.
               
               
                  Wom
                  Come sit thee down all by my side,
                  and when that thou art set,
                  say what then will vnto mée.
               
               
                  M.
                  Shew me vnfaignedly,
                  and tell me thy mind,
                  For one may haue a yong wench
                  that is not ouer-kind.
               
               
                  W.
                  Seeke all the world for such a one,
                  then hardly shall you find
                  a Loue of such perfection.
               
               
                  M.
                  This single life to wearisome,
                  faine would I marry:
                  But feare of ill chusing
                  makes me to tarry:
                  Some sayes that flesh is flexible,
                  and quickly it will vary.
               
               
                  W.
                  It's very true, God mend them.
               
               
                  M.
                  Why speak'st thou ill of women,
                  sith thou thy selfe art one?
               
               
                  W.
                  Would all the rest were constant
                  saue I my selfe alone.
               
               
                  M.
                  Faith, good or bad, or howsoe're,
                  I cannot liue alone,
                  but néeds I must bee married.
               
               
                  W.
                  To marry with a yong wench,
                  shée'l make thee poore with pride:
                  To marry with one of middle age,
                  perbaps she hath béene try'd:
                  To marry with an old one,
                  to freeze by fire side;
                  both old and young are faulty.
               
               
                  M.
                  Ile marry with a yong wench,
                  of beauty and of wit.
               
               
                  W.
                  It is better tame a yong Colt,
                  without a curbing bit.
               
               
                  M.
                  But she will throw her rider downe.
               
               
                  W.
                  I true, he cannot sit.
                  
                     whan Fillies fall a wighing.
               
               
                  M.
                  Ile marry one of middle age,
                  for she will loue me well.
               
               
                  W.
                  But if her middle much be vs'd,
                  by heauen and by hell;
                  Thou shalt find more griefes
                  than thousand tongues can tell:
                  Ah, silly man, God helpe thee.
               
               
                  M.
                  Ile marry with an old wench,
                  that knowes not good from bad.
               
               
                  W.
                  But once within a fortnight
                  shée'l make her husband mad.
               
               
                  M.
                  Beshrew thee for thy counsell,
                  sor thou hast made me sad:
                  but needs I must be married.
               
               
                  W.
                  To marry with a young wench,
                  me thinkes it were a blisse:
                  To marry one of middle age.
                  it were not much amisse.
                  I'de marry one of old age,
                  and match where money is;
                  there's none are bad in chusing.
               
               
                  M.
                  Then thou for all thy saying,
                  commendst the single life.
               
               
                  W.
                  I, fréedome is a popish
                  banishment of strife.
               
               
                  M.
                  Hold thy tongue fond woman,
                  for I must haue a wife.

                     When you are once married
                     all one whole yeare,
                     Tell me of your fortune,
                     and méet with mée here:
                     To thinke vpon my counsell
                     thou wilt shed many a teare;
                     till which time I will leaue thée.
                  
               
               
                  M.
                  
                     Were I but assured,
                     and of a Beggars lot,
                     Still to liue in misery,
                     and neuer worth a groat,
                     To haue my head well furnished
                     as any horned Goat;
                     for all this would I marry.
                  
                  
                     Farewell you lusty Batchelors,
                     to marriage I am bent:

                     Ile tell you the euent;
                     And tell the cause, if cause there be,
                     wherein I doe repent,
                     that euer I did marry.
                  
               
               FINIS.

                  how doest thou fare?
               
               
                  M.
                  As one quite marr'd with marriage,
                  consum'd and fill'd with care:
                  Would I had tane thy counsell.
               
               
                  W.
                  But thou wouldst not beware.
               
               
                  M.
                  Alas, it was my fortune.
               
               
                  W.
                  What griefe doth most oppresse thée?
                  may I request to know?

                  That I haue got a wanton.
               
               
                  W.
                  But is she not a shrew?
               
               
                  M.
                  Shée's any thing that euill is,
                  but I must not say so.
               
               
                  W.
                  For feare that I should flout thee.
               
               
                  M.
                  Indéed to mocke at misery,
                  would adde vnto my griefe.
               
               
                  W.
                  But I will not torment thée,
                  but rather lend reliefe:
                  And therefore in thy marriage,
                  tell me what w
                        •
                     es are chiefe;
                  good cousell yet may cure thée.
               
               
                  W.
                  Is not thy huswife testy,
                  too churlish and too sowre?
               
               
                  M.
                  The deuill is not so waspish,
                  shee's neuer pleas'd an hower.
               
               
                  W.
                  Canst thou not tame a deuill?
                  
                     lies it not in thy power?

                  Alas I cannot coniure.
               
               
                  W.
                  What, goeth she not a gossiping,
                  to spend away thy store?
               
               
                  M.
                  Doe what I can, I promise you,
                  shée's euer out of dore;
                  That were I nere so thrifty,
                  yet she would make me poore:
                  woes me I cannot mend it,
               
               
                  W.
                  How goeth shée in apparell?
                  delights she not in pride?

                  No more than Birds doe bushes,
                  or harts the riuer side,
                  Witnesse to that, her looking-glasse,
                  where shée hath stood in pride
                  a whole fore-noone together.
               
               
                  W.
                  How thinkst then? was she honest,
                  and loyall to thy bed?
               
               
                  M.
                  I thinke her legs doe fall away,
                  for spring time keeping head.
                  And were not hornes inuisible,
                  I warrant you I were sped
                  with broad browed Panthers.

                  Thy griefe is past recouery,
                  no salue will help but this:
                  To take thy fortune patiently,
                  and brooke her w

                  Yet many things amended are,
                  that haue beene long amisse;
                  and so in time may she be.
               
               
                  M.
                  I cannot stay here longer,
                  my wife or this doth stay:
                  And he thats bound as I am bound,
                  perforce must needs obey.

                  since you will needs away;
                  I can but grieue thy fortune.

                  All you that be at libertie,
                  and would be void of strife:
                  I speake it on experience,
                  ne're venture on a wife,
                  For if you match, you will be matcht
                  to such a weary life,
                  that you will all repent you.
