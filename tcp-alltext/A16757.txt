            To the Reader.
            
               YOu that reade, what you would
be, I know not; what you would
not be, you know your selfe: But
what you should be, God knowes:
But for my selfe, I haue founde
what is best to be, and so wishe
other, except they neither knowe what they should
be: nor well what they would, or would not be: Scorne

                not, because it is in verse, or rime, for if you will
reade it, you maie perhaps finde more pleasure and
profit in it, then a worse piece of prose: not to perswade
you to any thing, further then your liking;
I leaue the censure of it, to your discretion, and my
better Labours as they fall out, to your further content.
And so, loath to make you beleeue more, then
perhaps you shall finde, hoping, that no man will be
angry with his owne shadowe, nor saie (meaning

               ; as

bee: and without would not, would bee as I should
be.
            
               Your friend and well-willer,

            I
WOVLD,
And would not.
            
               1.
               I Would I had, as much as might be had,
               Of wealthy wishes, to the woldes content:
               That I might liue, all like a lusty Ladde,
               And scorne the world, and care not how it went:
               But eate, and drinke, and sleepe, and sing, and play,
               And so in pleasures, passe my time away.
            
            
               2.
               And yet I would not: for too wealthy then,
               I should be troubled with a world of toyes:
               Kinred, Companions, Troups of Seruing-men;
               Fashion-Deuisers, Fooles, and Guirles, & Boyes:
               Fidlers, and Iesters, Monkeys, Apes, Babounes,
               Drunckards, and Swaggerers, and such trouble-townes.
            
            
               3.
               Besides, I should forget to finde the way,
               That leades the Soule to her Eternall blisse;
               And then my state were at a wofull stay,
               No, I would wish, a better world then this.
               And in Afflictions, here on Earth to dwell,
               Rather then seeke my Heau'n on earth, & run to hell.
            
            
               
               4.
               I would I were a man of such deepe wit,
               As might discerne the depth of e
                     •
                  ery cause:
               That wherefoere I did in Iudgement sit,
               I might be held a Note-booke, in the Lawes.
               My braine might seeme a kinde of miracle:
               And euery word I spake, an Oracle.
            
            
               5.
               And yet I would not, for then, woe were me,
               I should be troubled wit
                     •
                   a world of Cases:
               Both rich and poore, would then 
                     ••
                  y Clients be,
               Some, with their pleasing, some, with piteous faces:
               And when the Rich had left their briberie,
               I should not rest for Formap
                        •
                     uperie.
               
            
            
               6.
               I would I were a man of greatest power,
               That swaies a Scepter, on this worlds great Masse:
               That I might sit on toppe of pleasures Tower,
               And make my will, my way, where ere I passe:
               That Lawe might haue her being from my breath,
               My smile might be a life, my frowne a death.
            
            
               7.
               And yet I would not, for then, doe I feare,
               Enuy or Malice would betray my trust:
               And some vile spirit, though against the haire,
               Would seeke to lay mine honor in the dust.
               Treason, or Murther, would beset me so:
               I should not knowe, who were my friend, or foe.
            
            
               
               8.
               No, I doe rather wish the Lowe estate,
               And be an honest Man, of meane degrees:
               Be lou'd for good, and giue no cause of hate,
               And clime no higher, then a Haw-thorne tree;
               Pay euery man his owne, giue Reason, right:
               And work
                     •
                   all day, and take my rest at night.
            
            
               9.
               For sure in Courtes, are worlds of costly Cares,
               That Comber Reason, in his course of rest:
               Let me but learne, how thrift both spends & spares;
               And make enough, as good as any feast.
               And fast, and pray, my daies may haue good end,
               And welcome all, that pleaseth God to send.
            
            
               10.
               I would I were the fairest, sweetest Creature,
               That could be painted, with the purest Art:
               That Arte might wonder at the worke of Nature,
               How so perfection made vp euery part.
               That euery Eye that saw mee, might admire mee,
               And euery heart, heard of me, might desire me.
            
            
               11.
               And yet I would not, for then, out alasse,
               I should be troubled with a world of fooles:
               When many a simple Idle headed Asse,
               Would put his wits vnto some Poets schooles,
               To learne to make a verse to flatter mee:
               As there were no such louing foole as hee.
            
            
               
               12.
               No, I doe rather wish the louely Browne,
               Where vertues Beauty makes the Inward faire:
               Then be the gallant Gazer of the towne,
               And make mine honor, but a Barbers Chaire:
               Whē none that had, with losse of treasure tride me,
               Once finding my foule Inside would abide me.
            
            
               13.
               I would I were an Innocent, a foole,
               That can do nothing else, but laugh or crie:
               And eate fat-meate, and neuer goe to schoole;
               And be in loue, but with an Apple-pie:
               Weare a pide-Coate, a Cockes-Combe, and a Bell,
               And thinke it did become me passing well.
            
            
               14.
               And yet I would not: for then should I not
               Discerne the difference, twixt the good & bad:
               Nor how the gaine of all the world is got,
               Nor who are sober, wise, nor who are mad.
               Nor in the Truth of follies sence to see:
               Who's the foole now? ther's no such foole as hee?
            
            
               15.
               I would I were a Fidler, and could play,
               A thousand quauers in a minutes space:
               And at a Bridale, brauely leade the way,
               Before the Bride, and giue the Groome, a Grace.
               That I might shake the head, and stare, and gape,
               And make a thousand faces like an Ape.
            
            
               
               16.
               And yet I would not: for ten to one
               My fiddle, or my fingers should not rest:
               But euery Iacke a Lute would call vpon,
               Such Moris daunces as doe like him best:
               And euery wagtaile with a wanton Eye,
               Would hang vpon me for a Heidegy.
            
            
               17.
               I would I were a Cuckolde Wittal Asse,
               And car'de not who did mount my Hackney Saddle,
               Yet thinke I haue as true a louing Lasse
               As ere lay in Swadling Clouts or Cradle:
               And manerly goe to the Church before her,
               And would not heare, how many did be whore her.
            
            
               18.
               And yet I would not: for then doe I feare,
               My hornes would be so hard, I could not bide them
               And whē their weight were more thē I could beare
               Alas I know not what to doe to hide them.
               But euery one would say in bitter scornes,
               Looke yonder goes a gallant paire of hornes.
            
            
               19.
               I would I were the arranst Cuckolde maker,
               That euer answerde for his Aperne sport:
               There should not scape a wench, but I would take her
               And set her to her worke in such a sort
               That all the world should know, while I had health
               I would not see an Idle Common-wealth.
            
            
               
               20.
               And yet I would not: for then doe I doubt,
               
                  Bride-well and I, should wrestle for the Whippe:
               And once got in, I hardly should get out:
               Till I had soundly pay'd for Trully-Trippe,
               Whē all the Beggers in the street would whoo me,
               And do me all the shame, that they could do me,
            
            
               21.
               I would I were a most notorious Thiefe,
               That might affright all true men, where I goe:
               And when I made demaund, they might be briefe,
               That in their Budgets doe my busines knowe.
               And such as trauaile, with concealed treasure,
               Should be but Stewards, to maintain my pleasure.
            
            
               22.
               And yet I would not: for then out of doubt,
               Some dogge, or diuel, would for Coyne betray me:
               Some priuy search, would surely finde me out,
               O
                     •
                   Watch, or Warrant, some way, would way-lay me.
               And being caught, with Bills, & Clubb
                     •
                  s, & staues,

                  , with a crue of beastly Slaues.
            
            
               23.
               Then to the Iustice, brought with such a Ioy,
               As if some Campe, or Castle were surprisde:
               Who knowing how such Stragglers doe destroy,
               A world of wealth, hath presently deuisde,
               Vnto the Iaylers keeping to commend me:
               Where I must stay, vntill the gallowes end me.
            
            
               
               25.
               No, I had rather leade a quiet life,
               And feare to looke no true man in the face:
               Keepe a poore house, maintaine an honest wife,
               Trauell no further then the Market-place.
               On Sundayes goe to Church, and home againe,
               And with my neighbors, drinke a pot, or twaine.
            
            
               26.
               I would I were a Iuggler, and could play
               A thousand p
                     •
                  ankes vpon a Pepper-corne:

                  s of Wyzardes, so away,
               They all might wonder at a Bullockes-horne.
               And with their purses, runne and follow mee,
               To make them thinke they see, they doe not see.
            
            
               27.
               And yet I would not: for then well I know,
               Some Eye, or other, would my sleights descrye:
               And to the world reueale my cunning so,
               I could not answere for my Knauery.
               But some Curst-queane, would either cracke my crown,
               Or Constable, would course me out of town.
            
            
               28.
               I would I were a Myller, and could grinde
               A hundred thousand bushells in an houre:
               And ere my M

               29.
               And yet I would not; least my Thumbes should be
               Held all too great vpon my towling-dish:
               And such as did my secret cunning see,
               Might curse, and wish mee many a bitter wish:
               And

                  ay, when they before the Mill-dore-stand,

               30.
               No, I had rather fairely buye my bread,
               And spend it as I get it honestly:
               Then scarcely sleepe in quiet in my Bed,
               When I but thinke vpon my subtilty;
               To lay the wench along vpon the Sacke,
               And steale her meale, e

               I would I were a Taylor, and could cut
               A thousand yardes of Veluet out in shreads:
               And in my purse, the money closely put,
               While simple hearts were beating of their heads,

               32.
               And yet I would not: least by falshoods trade,
               I should be call'd a stealer, that's a thiefe:
               No, in no wise, by such meanes to be made
               A Master-workman, were too great a griefe.
               No, Let me rather be an honest youth,
               That neuer stole a yarde of stuffe in truth.
            
            
               
               33.
               I would I were a Keeper of a Parke,
               To walke with my bent Crosse-bow, & my hound,

               34.
               And yet I would not: least if I be spide,
               I might be turned quite out of my walke;
               And afterwards more punishment abide,
               Then longs vnto a little angry talke.
               And cause more mischiefe after all, come to me,
               Then all the good the Does did euer doe me.
            
            
               34.
               No, I had rather bee an honest Keeper,
               To walke my Parke, and looke vnto my Pales;
               And not to play the sluggard and the sleeper,
               And holde my Land-lord vp with idle tales.
               Take but my Fees, be merry with my Dame,
               And so to gaine, and keepe an honest name.

               And yet I would not: least by my blacke face,
               I might be held a Diuell then in deed:
               And so to doe my fellowes all disgrace,
               When many a one the worse for me should speed.
               No, God forbid, let me be true and iust,
               While other hide, the Diuell in the dust.

               I would I were a Gardiner, and had skill,
               To digge and rake, & plant, and sowe, and slippe:
               The Caterpiller, and the Mowle to kill,
               To proyne my Trees, and all my stalks to strippe.
               And when to plucke my fruite, and sowe my seeds,
               And how to keep my Gardein cleane frō weeds.
            
            
               39.
               And yet I would not: for then should I feare,
               The Thiefe, the Mowle, the Worm, & blasting windes:
               
               I should not looke about me any where,
               But I should finde some crosses in their kindes.
               My Plants would wither, or my seedes would rot,
               Or loose in one yeare, more then ere I got.
            
            
               40.
               No, I would rather take the Markets happe,
               And pay my Coyne, & keepe my minde in quiet:
               And what I bought, to bring home in my lappe,
               And when I come home, dresse it for my Dyet.
               Then in my Gardein, watch a Mowle or

               41.
               I would I were a Painter of such Art,
               As like Appelles, might abuse the Eye:
               And to the life, so set out euery part,
               That straunge Conceits might bee deceiu'd thereby.
               And I might vse my pensill in such sort,
               As all the world should neuer make report.
            
            
               42.
               And yet I would not: for then doe I feare,
               My heart might fall vpon Idolatry:
               For while my hand were drawing of a haire,
               I might be rapt into a thought too high.
               When thinking to behold an Angels face,
               Forget the diuell in an other place.
            
            
               43.
               No, I had rather onely learne to knowe,
               The difference of my Colours in their kindes:
               And haue a care, to set my shadowes so,
               They may not be a hurt to blessed mindes.
               And vse my pensill, on my cloath, and boord,
               And for what price I might my paines affoord.

               I would I were a Merchant of all wares,
               That I might furnish all both Rich and poore:
               And what should fall vnto the Beggars shares,
               I might haue plenty, alwaies at my doore.
               My shoppe might be a Market of such state,
               As all the world may stand and wonder at.

               And yet I would not: for euen doe I feare,
               I should finde many a Begger in my booke:
               And when I could my mony not forb

                  are,
               I might goe hang my credit on a booke.
               When if both Towne, and Country came vnto me,
               In one, or both, some debt

                  rs would vndo me.
            
            
               46.
               No, I would rather be of meane estate,
               Haue mony alwaies ready in my chest:
               Be sure to buy my wares at the best rate,
               And sell good stuffe, and serue my friends the best,
               And cosen no man, with false weight nor measure,
               But with true dealing make a poore mās treasure.
            
            
               47.
               I would I were a practiser in Phisicke,
               To know my simples, Compounds, & my waters,
               To heale the Rume, the Tooth-ach and the Tisicke,
               
               The Coughe, olde Aches, & such other matters,
               That I might by my skill in generall,

               48.
               And yet I would not: for then day nor night,
               I should haue quiet scarcely in my bed:
               And in my Conscience haue full many a fright,
               To heare my Patient suddenly were dead:
               When by a Vomit, I had burst his heart,
               Or pur'gde his guttes out through the nether part.

               No, I had rather bee an Herbalist,
               To know the vertue both of Hearbs & Rootes,
               Then be too bolde and desperate Alchymist;
               
               That ofte his weight and measure ouer-shootes,
               And so, by either want of Care, or skill,
               In steede of Curing, giue a killing-Pill.

               And had such trickes to make my market well,
               That I might send home fooles with Had-I-wist.
               That while poore soules did sit with losses crying,
               I might growe Rich, with swearing, & with lying.

               And yet I would not: for my Conscience then,
               Wold make me feele the smart of falshoods woe:
               When I beheld the ends of faithles men,
               With what a horror to their Hell they goe.

               Now fie vpon them, Brokers, Bawdes and Theeues,
               Make poore men weare their Ierkins without sleeues.
            
            
               63.
               I would I were a close promoting Mate,
               To picke a hole in each offenders Coat:
               And make a shew of seruice to the State,
               When I would purse vp many a priuy groat:
               But in great Summes follow my Information,
               Till I were well paied for a Reformation.
            
            
               64.
               And yet I would not: for then euery knaue
               Would single me out, for a secret friend:
               And teach me how to play the cunning slaue,
               To bring my busines to a wretched ende.
               While hellish Craft with Cloke of heresie,
               Might hide a world of foule iniquitie.
            
            
               
               65.
               No, I would rather learne my selfe t'amend
               What is amisse, and so my friends aduise;
               Then when I see an other man offend,
               In secret, seeke his 
                     •
                  uine to deuise.
               And making shew to seeke the good of all,
               Set vp my selfe, with many thousands fall.
            
            
               66.
               I would I were a Tapster, fill my pot
               Halfe vp with froth, and make my gaine of drinke:
               And make no Care, how I my mony got,
               So I might hea
                     •
                  e my Golde and siluer chinke.
               Make more of Drunkardes then of better men,
               By putting off bad licour now and then.
            
            
               67.
               And yet I would not: for then should I be,
               At Call and Checke of euery Iacke and Gill:
               And many a Lobcocke would looke into me,
               What drinke I drew, how I my pot did fill:
               And sometime trust so farre vpon the score,
               I scarce should put my head out of the doore.
            
            
               68.
               No, I had rather runne an other Race,
               Though for lesse profit, yet for more content:
               That both with God and man, might be in Grace,
               Wherein my time might be more happily spent.
               And rather pay, my penny for my pot,
               Then cosen twenty people for a groat.
            
            
               
               69.
               I would I were as tall, and stout a man,
               As euer drewe a sword out of a sheath:
               That I might see, who durst come neere my Canne,
               Or speake a word, where I but seeme to breath,
               Or fortune durst, but crosse me with her wheeles,
               For feare to see, her braines about her heeles.
            
            
               70.
               And yet I would not: for then where should I
               Bestowe my selfe? but euery man would flie me:
               I should be sure to haue no company,
               Where none that loue themselues, that wil come nigh me,
               And fortune would be sure to fit me so,
               That she wold some way seeke mine ouerthrow.
            
            
               71.
               I would I were a Trauellor, to passe
               The Roughest Seas, and card'e for winde and weather:
               And might arriue, where neuer Creature was,
               But Beasts, & Birds▪ that liue & feede together.
               And tell at home what I abroad haue seene,
               Where neuer man yet but my selfe had beene.
            
            
               72.
               And yet I would not: for I feare, that fewe
               Would trust my stories, were they nere so true:
               Words are but winde, and winde is but a Dewe,
               Farre Trauellers may say that blacke is Blewe.
               Although perhaps some simple soules may say,
               Surely, this man hath trauailde a great way:
            
            
               
               73.
               No, I will rather trye my Fortunes heere,
               And to my best aduantage vse my wittes:
               Then runne abroad, and buye Repentance deere,
               Knowing how ofte, vnhappily Fortune

               When weather-beaten Sailes, with winde, & raine,
               Scarce make a Sauing-Voyage home againe.
            
            
               74.
               I would I were a Player, and could Act
               As many partes, as came vpon a Stage:
               And in my braine, could make a full Compact,
               Of all that pasteth betwixt Youth and Age.
               That I might haue fiue-shares in euery Play,
               And let them laugh, that beare the Bell-away.
            
            
               75.
               And yet I would not: For then doe I feare,
               If I should gall some Goos-cappe with my speech:
               That he would freat & fume, and chase, and sweare,
               As if some Flea had bit him by the Breech.
               And in some passion, or strange Agonie,
               
               Disturbe both mee, and all the Companie.
            
            
               76.
               I would I were a Poet, and could write;
               The passage of this Paltry world in time:
               And talke of Warres, and many a valiant fight,
               And how the Captaines did to Honor clime.
               Of Wise, and Faire, of Gratious, Vertuous, kinde,
               And of the Bounty of a noble minde.
            
            
               
               77.
               But speake but little of the life of Loue,
               
               Because it is a thing so harde to finde:
               And touch but little at the Turtle-Doue,
               Seeing there are but fewe Byrdes of that kinde.
               And Libell against leawde and wicked harts,
               That on the earth, doe play the Diuells-parts.
            
            
               78.
               And yet I would not: for then would my braines,
               Be with a world of toyes Intoxicate:
               And I should fall vpon a thousand vaines,
               Of this and that, and well I know not what.
               When some would say, that saw my Frantick fittes,
               Surely the Poet is beside his wittes.
            
            
               79.
               I would I were an honest Countrey-Wench,
               That only could make Curtsey, smoile, & blush,
               And sit me downe vpon a good-Ale bench,
               And answere wanton Tomkin, with a Iush.
               And well, Go-too, and How-now? Pray-away,
               And for a Tanzey, goe to Stoole-Ball-play.

               And yet I would not: For then doe I feare,
               My Louers would be out of loue with mee:
               If I would not belieue them when they sweare,
               That I am shee, and I am onely shee,
               Of all the Maydes, before the Church-house dore;
               That hath their harts, and what can I haue more?

               No, I had rather be an honest wife,
               And loue my husband, and looke to my house;
               And with my Neighbours leade a quiet life,
               And keepe a Cat, to driue away the Mouse.
               Hatch vp my Chickins, pen vp my clocke-Henne,
               And haue nothing to doe with naughtie men.
            
            
               102.
               I would I were the gallanst Courtizan,
               That euer put a foure-Ear'de Asse to schoole:
               That I might cleane put downe Maide Marian,
               And neuer be without my dainty foole.

               103.
               And yet I would not: for then doe I doubt,
               Some Cunstable, or Beadie of Bridewell:
               By some olde Bawde, would surely find me out,
               When for his silence, I should pay full well.
               Or Cart it to the place of youthes Correction,
               Where chopping Chalke, would quite spoile my Complexion.
            
            
               104.
               No, I had rather be an honest Maide,
               That neuer knewe any loues delight:
               And of a man, almost to be afraide,
               Then see me to set my Maider head so light.
               As for a wicked choise, to chaunge my name,
               To fit me onely, with a f

               105.
               I would I were a Bruer, and could make
               My water pay the charges of my Malt:
               And for small Beere, the price of strong beere take,
               And helpe a musty Barrell with bay salt.
               Keepe leaking vessells, stoppe them vp with Clay,
               The drinke may runne out, when the Earth's away.
            
            
               106.
               And yet I would not: for then I should thinke,
               If I should take good mony for ill Beere:
               My Customers would curse me for my drinke,
               And say I solde both that was naught, and deere.
               And one so driue an other daily fro me,
               That in the ende they would quite ouerthrow me.

               No, I had rather truly pay my penny
               For my full pot of either Ale or Beere:
               Then seeke that hurt or spoiling of a many,
               Or to vndoe the poore in a deere yeere.
               Or make them say, whose trust I doe abuse,
               Oh wicked Bruer, looke what drinke he brues.
            
            
               108.
               I would I were an excellent Diuine,
               That had the Bible at my fingers ends:
               The world might heare out of this mouth of mine,
               How God did make his Enemies his friends.
               I were so follow'de, as if none but I,
               Could plainely speake of true Diuinity.
            
            
               
               109.
               And yet I would not: for then ten to one,
               I should be call'd but a Precizian:
               Or Formalist, and might goe preach alone,
               Vnto my holy brother Puritan.
               And so be flouted for my zealous loue,
               In taking paines for other mens behoue.
            
            
               110.
               No, I had rather reade, and vnderstand
               The Rules of Grace, that haue the learned led:
               To know the power of the Almighty hand,
               And with what foode, the blessed flocke are fed.
               Rather then with a thundring and long praier,
               To leade into presumption, or dispaire.

               I would I were a man of warlike might,
               And had the Title of a Generall:
               To point the Captaines euery one their fight,
               Where should the Vangard, and the Rereward fall.
               Who should be leaders of the forlorne hope,
               And who the Entrance to the Army ope.
            
            
               112.
               And yet I would not: for then I might see,
               How discontent might cause a Mutinie:
               Whereby the Army might in danger be,
               To be surprized by the Enemy.
               Or by the losse of men, for honors gaine,
               To wound my Conscience with a bloody paine.

               I would I were the Miserablest wretch
               That euer Crambde vp mony in his Chest:
               That I might learne, but like a dogge to fetch
               Lambes from the Folde, and Duckelings frō the nest.
               And when I tooke the paines to plucke and pull,
               Know how to gaine, by Feathers, and by wooll.
            
            
               115.
               And yet I would not: least while I did liue▪
               
               I should scarce trust my selfe with that I haue:
               I should not heare the word of Lend, nor giue,
               But only study, how to get and saue.
               And when I die, haue written on my doore,

               Away the wealth, that they did scrape for so.
            
            
               
               117.
               And yet I would not; least when all were gone,
               My stocke, my goods, my Leases, & my Lands:
               It sure would breake my heart to looke vpon,
               My whole estate to be in others hands.
               And then to hide me in some secret place,
               Or grieue to death, to thinke of my disgrace.
            
            
               118.
               I would I were so neate and Spruse a Noddy,
               As all in print, might speake, and looke, & walke:
               And so become for euery idle body,
               A kinde of 
                     •
                  able, or a Stable-talke.
               And say to see me, tripping on the Toe,
               The Fool's so prowd, he knows not how to goe.
            
            
               119.
               And yet I would not: least some Wood-cock-asse,
               To equall me in my 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     :
               
               Might paint, and princke himselfe vp in a glasse,
               And studie counterfeit Gentilitie.
               
               And so perhaps put mee into some passion,
               To see my fashion, growe so out of fashion.
            
            
               120.
               No, I will rather wisely looke about me,
               And weare both what, & how might fit my state:
               And haue a care within, what were without me,
               I might not be an Owle, to wonder at.
               But I might passe through all the Pide-coat-throng,
               And bee no Taber for an idle-toong.
            
            
               
               121.
               I would I were a Beastly-Epicure,
               
               That car'de for nothing but to eate and drinke:
               And talke of nought but Natures-Nour
                     •
                  ture,
               And filling vp my Flagons to the brinke.
               Of lusty swallowes, and of pleasing taste,
               And make no care how much good meat I waste.
            
            
               122.
               And yet I would not: least the world should say,
               Looke, yonder goes a barrell full of Beere:
               Who gulls in more good victualls in one day,
               Then might suffize an honest man a yeere.
               And ere he dye, it will (no doubt) be found,
               The Beast did burst, & stunck aboue the ground.
            
            
               123.
               No, I had rather keepe a better Dyet,
               And liue with Bread and water all my life:
               Then in my Guttes to keepe so great a Ryot,
               And in my S
                     •
                  omacke haue so sore a strife.
               That I should puffe, and blowe, and swell, & sweat,
               And be halfe-dead, ere I disgest my meat.
            
            
               124.
               I would I were a man of all mens mindes,
               My Wit were drawne into all kinde of passions:
               And my Conceyts were all of sundry kindes,
               My Cloathes made after all-Countrey-fashions.
               I knew the secret of all Natures-sence,
               And so of Earth, and all her Excellence.
            
            
               
               125.
               And yet I would not: for then sure should I,
               Be all too gaz'd at wheresoere I goe:
               And like the poore bare-feather'd Aesops-Pye,
               When euery Byrd did her owne-feather knowe.
               Be followed with many a flowting-lacke,
               Or Rauens feathers all pull'd from my backe.
            
            
               126.
               No, I had rather weare but home-spun-thread,
               And haue my Cloathes close vpon my Breech:
               And by my Labours-toyle to get my bread,
               And vse no other but my Countrey-speech.
               And rather haue a Foole thinke mee a foole,
               Then craftie work-men know me by my Toole.
            
            
               127.
               I would I were the truest-hearted woman,
               That euer spake with a most pleasing Toung:
               And neuer meane to giue offence to no man,
               Nor neuer thrust into an idle throng.
               But so haue care of all my Cariage,
               It may be helpe vnto my Mariage.
            
            
               128.
               And yet I would not: for then euery Maide,
               Within our towne, would stand & laugh at me:
               And call me Foole, and say I were afraide,
               To know what in an honest man might be.
               For shee that will not looke ere shee did leape,
               Might curse the Trades-man, though his Ware were cheape.
            
            
               
               129.
               No, I had rather be a reasonable,

               That would not feare the Constable,
               To see him looke in at our window-Grate.
               
                  As many We

               That haue bene medling with too-many men.
            
            
               130.
               I would I were the rarest Politician,
               
               That euer plotred for preheminence:
               And of the Doggedst disposition,
               That euer was in Natures residence.
               And car'de not how the worlde to Ruine went,
               So I might onely purchase my Content.
               
            
            
               131.
               And yet I would not: For then doe I feare,
               Some sudden-Flash frō Heau'n would fall vpon me:
               And all the world reioyce to see and heare,
               In helples griefe, how I am woe begon me.
               When I of force should bid the world Fare-well.
               
               And Death were sent to summon mee to Hell.
               
            
            
               132.
               No, I had rather keepe the plaine High-way,
               That leades the soule to her Eternall rest:
               Then by Illusion, seeke out a wry-way,
               To hatche my Egges vp, in the Diuells-nest.
               And with the Worlde, when I had made an ende▪
               
               To finde in Heau'n an Euerlasting-Friende.
               
            
            
               
               133.
               I would I were, and yet I would not too,
               Because I know not that, I know 
                     •
                  ot what:
               And when I would doe, then I cannot doe,
               When that would put out this, this put out that,
               And such strange Fancies would

               134.
               Then let me see, if I at least can see,
               What may be seene, that's worthie to be seene▪
               
               Wherein might be, and onely there might bee,

               Time hath a course, which nature cannot stay,

               May finde it in the ende a Tragedy,
               When mournefull Bells doe make no merry chime.
               When sad despaire shall feare Infernall euill,
               While Sinne and death, are Agents for the diuel.

               But doe not Raue, nor Raile, nor stampe, nor stare,
