               TO THE RIGHT Honorable and his very good Lorde Henrie Earle of Darbie, Lorde Stanley and Strange, Lorde of Man and of the Iles adioyninge, and Knight of the moſte noble order of the Garter: continuance of health with proſperitie, and increaſe of honor.

               YOV Knowe right well (right honorable & my very good Lorde) that I accordinge to my dutie giuinge attendaūce vpō your Lordſhippe in the tyme of Chriſtmas laſte paſt, was appointed by your honour to preach before you in your Chapple, at neweparke, the ſecond of Ienuarie, at which tyme I entreated of this text of Sainct Paule. Rom 13. [Id

me the ſpirit of vtteraūce. Which Sermon finiſhed, I was immediately called vnto your honor, & by you earneſtly requeſted without delay to ſet downe in wryting, ſuch leſſons and inſtructions as I had in your preſence, & before certain gētlemen of worſhip, vttered with my mouth. And herewithall it pleaſed your honor, not only to require a copie of my Sermon, but alſo to giue me to vnderſtand that you would ſend it vp to London to be Printed, to the ende that the thinges which I had vttered before a fewe at home in your houſe, might be further publiſhed abroade to the vſe and behoofe of many. Which when I perceaued, I muſt needes confeſſe, that I was very loth, & altogether vnwilling to deliuer to that ende into your Lordſhippes handes any copy of that which I had preched. Firſt bicauſe my dooinges are ſo ſimple, and my ſkil ſo ſmall, that they deſerue not to come abroade into the ſight of the world. Secondly, many are ſo fine and daintie, that nothing can pleaſe & content thē, vnleſſe it flow and ſwim with ſtore of

eloquence. Thirdly, and laſt of all, bicauſe I feare that when many haue read it▪ I ſhall by my playnneſſe procure to my ſelf more miſliking for publiſhing of it, then I had lyking of your honor for preaching of it. Howbeit your honors great goodneſſe diuers times ſhewed towards me, & your benefits beſtowed vpon me, which are yet greene & abyding freſh in my remembrāce, to my great releefe and comfort, & wherby I liue at this preſent a great deale the better, haue ouercome all lettes and impediments, & enforced me to ſatisfie your godly deſire herein. Choſing rather to be miſlyked for my doinges of a great many others, & to be reproued for my want of ſkil, then to ſhew my ſelfe not dutiful towards your honor in this behalfe, or to ſeeme ſlack to do any thing that may cōtent your noble mynde, eſpecially whē it pleaſeth your Lordſhip ſo earneſtly to require it of me: who am ſo much bounde to your honor, that I muſt nedes acknowledge my ſelf to be ouermuch vnthākful, if mi pore ſeruice wer not alwaies redi at your cōmādmēt Wherfore ſeing that it pleſed your 
                  •
               .

to accept ſo well of this Sermon, when it was preached, I am thereby emboldned to craue patronage of you now it is Printed and further publiſhed abrode, eſpecially bicauſe it now hathe more neede thereof. Moſt humbly deſiring your honor to take it in good part now as you dyd then, and to continue your good will to the faithfull Miniſters, & Preachers of the word, & to ſeeke euer more and more to promote the honor and glory of our good God: ſo that it may appere vnto al men that you haue in vtter hatred & deteſtation, the lying falſe doctrine of Antichriſt, as well as it is knowne to me and others that dayly haue experiēce of your honorable diſpoſition herein. The Lord of Lordes euermore enflame & direct your noble hart with his holy and gratious Spirit, increaſe all heroicall and godly vertues in you, with proſperitie and encreaſe of honor in this lyfe, & graunt that in the end you may ſo dye, that you may after wardes lyue for euer.

                  AND that cōſidering the ſeaſō, thatRom. 13. ca ver. 11. 12. 13. 14. it is now time that we ſhould ariſe from ſleepe: for now is our ſaluation nearer, then when we beleued it.
                  The night is paſt, and the daye is at hand, let vs therfor caſt away the works of darkeneſſe, and let vs put on the armour of light.
                  So that we walke honeſtly, as in the day: not in gluttonie, & dronkenneſſe, neither in chambering and wantonnes, not in ſtrife and enuyinge:
                  But put ye on the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and take no thought for the fleſhe, to fulfill the luſtes of it.
               
            
            
               RIght honorable, if we way and conſider the holy Scriptures, we ſhall eaſily finde and ſoone perceiue, that our conuerſaiton is then worthy of great praiſe, & our life beſt framed to gods will, and the rule of his lawe, when it ſhalbe euery waye moſt profitable to our neighbours.
            
               For god requireth nothing more earneſtly of vs thē loue, & he would haue ſuch a bande of friendſhipe amongeſt men, y• they might be knit together as members of one body. And for this cauſe hath he oftentimes in his word commaunded vs with no leſſe chéerefulnes to be as ready to pleaſure, and to doe good to our neighboures then to our ſelues. So that it is not without good cauſe that S. Paule in this chapter euen in the verſe next goinge before this text▪ ſaith, that loue is the fulfilling of the lawe. For Paule ſpeaking here of the dueties and debt that we owe one to an other, doth giue vs to vnderſtand that whatſoeuor is contayned in y• ſecond table of gods lawe is comprehended in theſe fewe words, loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe. And true it is that ſuch is the force of holy and godly loue, that it worketh not euill, but it ſeeketh to ouercome euill with goodnes, neyther will it permit and ſuffer a man to hurt his neighbour. He that loueth his father and mother will ſhewe himſelfe obedient

and lowly towards them, he will bée ready to ayde and aſſiſt them, and willinge to do after their commaundement, and be affrayde to doe any thing that may diſpleaſe and offend them. Hée that loueth his neighbour will not inwardly in minde conceue malice and hatred agynſt him, neither will he go about to offer violence and wrong too any man, but will ſeeke to preſerue his life, and to procure his welfare, yea though it be to his owne hinderan̄ce. He that loueth his neighbour will not goe about to defile his neighbors bed with fiilthy and execrable whoredome, neither will ſeeke to cōpany wt any woman out of marriage, & beinge maried will haue & enioye his owne wife ſoberly, and doe nothinge vnſéeminge the honorable eſtate of matrimonie.
            Hee that loueth his neighbour will not goe about to plucke awaye from him any part of his ſubſtance by violence, fraude, or anye other vnlawefull meanes. Hée that loueth

his neighbour, will not backbite him or make or forge lyes of him to his diſprofit any maner of waye. To be briefe, he wil ſo deale with his neighbour as he would haue other men to deale with him. Nowe after that the apoſtle hath ſet downe certaine godly rules touching the duties of loue and holy life, leaſt peraduēture they might ſone ſlyde out our mindes, he thought it good and right néedfull here in the ende of the chapter, to perſwade vs there vnto by certaine waightye and graue reaſons. By which he goeth about to perſwade all men, which belieue in Chriſt, to expreſſe their fayth by good workes, and holines of lyfe: which thing in déede is not lightly to be regarded, but aduiſedly to be conſidered, eſpecially ſéeing that god doth require it euery where of vs in his holy worde. For ſéeing that god in the beginning, when as we were nothing but claye, and earth, did of his onely grace and goodnes breath into vs the ſpirite of life, placed our firſt parentes in Paradice, a place full of all pleaſurs

and goodnes, and afterward when as we by ſinne and tranſgreſſion had loſt that worthines, that by creacion wée had, and were become ſubiect to death and eternall damnacion, he did reſtore vs againe to lyfe and confirme vs in y• ſame by the promiſe of Chrſt to come, who by the innocencie of his manhood, hath recouered that for vs which wée before by ſinne, and diſobedience had deſtroyed. Theſe thinges I ſaye conſidered, we ſhalbe not only verye much vnthankefull, but alſo moſt wicked, vnleſſe we conſtantly defend this our dignitye, bought and obtayned with y• price of Chriſt his bloud, and aboue al, loue that GOD againe that loued vs firſt ſo derely, and forth with endeuor our ſelues euery day more and more, to liue as it becōmeth vs, walking all the dayes of our lyfe in holy feare before the Lord. And truly to the performaunce of theſe thinges, the conſideraciō of this perell of ſcripture may very much profyte vs
            The which I will deuide into thrée parets.
            
               
               1 The firſt parte contayneth an exhortatiō to liue vprightly wt certaine great & weighty reaſons to perſwade vs therevnto.
               2 The ſecond parte ſetteth downe what we muſt ſhunne & auoide if we will liue vprightly and honeſtly.
               3 The third & laſt parte teacheth to put on a newe garment, and to fight againſt our owne wicked luſtes and croked affections.
            
            The apoſtle & choſen veſſell of Chriſt S. Paule did very well way and conſider that ſuch is naughtines & corrupcion of mans nature, yt he is not eaſily perſwaded to doe thoſe thinges, which the Lord by his word hath cōmaūded, and to leaue thoſe thinges 
                  •
               ndone, which he hath by his worde forbidden. And therfore after yt he hath commended vnto vs charity & giuen vs to vnderſtand howe we ſhould liue, leaſt we ſhould let theſe good leſſons ſlyppe out our mindes, he ſeketh to perſwade vs thervnto by certaine weightye and graue reaſons.
            The firſt reaſon which the Apoſtle

here in this text vſeth to perſwade vs to liue vprighly & to forſake ſinne, and wickednes, is takē of ye circumſtaunce of the time, the wordes be theſe: And that coſidering the ſeaſon, it is nowe time for vs to awake out of ſléepe. In which verſe he telleth vs that it is now high time for vs to amend our liues, and to ſerue God, eſpecially becauſe good oportunitie ſerueth therevnto, and ſomuch the rather bycaſue the cloudes of ignoraūce, vnbeléefe, and wicked luſtes, are now driuen away from vs by the light of the goſpell, and knowledge of gods truth, and therefore it behoueth vs ſo to order our liues as they which haue y• light, and which are ſtill conuerſaunt in the open ſight & eies of all men. For they which perceue that all mens eies are bent vppon them, haue a diligent care leaſt they ſhould doe any thing that is not ſéemelye and honeſt, bycauſe they knowe by experience, that if they ſteppe neuer ſ
                  ••
                lyttle aſide out of the ryght waye, then they

ſhall bée eſpyed and haue many witneſſes ready to accuſe them, of theyr ſinne and iniquitie. So in like maner, it behoueth vs (who liue in the ſighte of God and his angels, hauing Chriſte the true ſōne of rightuouſneſſe, a vewer, and beholder of all our dooings, cōmaūding vs to walke as before him) to take aduiſed héede, y• we doo nothing yt may offēd his diuine maieſty, bicaſe if we ſo doo, we ſhall haue Chriſt himſelf a witnes againſt vs, who ſhall iudge in ye laſt day, & pronounce ſentene vpon all fleſh, acording to ye tenour of iuſtice and equitye. But it appereth that▪ the talke that is here vſed, is not plaine, but Metaphoricall. For the Apoſtle maketh mencion of ſléepe, of waking, of night, of darkenes, of lyght, of day. And therefore before I procéede any further in the text. I thinke it méete and conuenient to declare vnto you, what is ment, by euery one of theſe wordes, to the ende that, that which I am about to teach, may bée more manifeſt and playne to you that be my hearers.
            
               Know ye therefore that by ſléepe, hée meaneth ſinne, and a certen ſluggiſhnes and drowſines to imbrace the goſpell, to heare gods word, and to frame and faſhion our liues ther after. By awaking out of ſléepe, hée meaneth a certen deſire and readines to doe our duties, and ſuch things as God requireth of vs in his worde.
            
               Ariſtole therfore doth very well and truely cal waking a liberty or fréedom of the ſences, and hée calleth ſléepe a bande or impryſoninge of them. For when a man is a ſléepe, he hath all his ſences, ſo tyed vp & impriſoned, that he hath neither eyes to ſée, eares to heare, noſe to ſmell, handes to touche, féete to goe, nor hart to conceyue, but is like vnto a deade corps that lyeth rottinge in the graue: But when a man is a wake, then is hée ready ynough to ſée, to heare, to ſpeake, to run, to goe, or to doe any thing belonging to a reaſonable creature. Therefore the Apoſtle ſayth it is now time for vs to awake out of ſléepe, as though hée ſhould haue ſayd before our regeneration,

before god had geuē vs eies te ſe, and harts to beleue ye truth, we were faſt a ſleepe in ſinne, and did lye in the ſhadowe of death, and there was nothing in vs but horrible blindnes, ſo that we could not ſee ye maieſty of god, we did not féele and faſt ye mercies of god offered to vs in Chriſt his deare and welbeloued ſōne, neither had we learned how ſwéete ye Lorde is. Our eares were ſo ſtopped y• we could not harken vnto the ſwéete voyce of God, and glad tidinges of ſaluatiō, we perceaued nothing at all of the goodnes of God towards vs, neither yet were we moued to any worke of charitye towards our neighbour but were vtterlye vnapt & altogether vnable to doo any good worke, yea not ſo much, ſo much as to thinke a good thought. But now ſeinge it hath pleaſed the lord to pittye our miſery, to awake vs out of this deadlye & daungerous ſleepe of ſinne, to ſend his worde amongeſt vs, and by it through the working of his ſpirit to create fayth in vs, it is very méete and alſo right nedefull that we

ſléepe no more in ſine, but riſe vp with al ſpéed vnto newnes of life. For ſeing we haue nowe the light of the Goſpell amōgſt vs, it is now no time for vs, to 
                  •
               lugge and ſléepe any more, and to folowe ye luſtes & pleaſures of the fleſhe, as though Chriſt had neuer bene preched vnto vs, and we neuer called by the voyce of God to repentance and amendment of lyfe. Let vs therefore not neclect this good occaſion, conſidering y• the apoſtle doth héere fel vs that it is nowe high tyme for vs to awake out of ſléepe: but let euery man be redy to do his duty, ſéeing that good opportunitye ſerueth therevnto, & we ought in no wiſe to deferre the reformation of things that be amiſſe, from daye, to daye, and yere, to yere, and to be idle at ſuch a time as this is, bicauſe god perchaunce will not alwaies graunt vs ye like occaſion to do good. And therfore it behoueth vs to ſtrayne our ſelus the more whileſt occaſion

An other reaſon which ought to perſwade vs to doo our dutye without delay, is becauſe our lyfe is ſhort and paſſeth away ſwyftly, and good occaſions of well dooing ſlippe away apace, and therefore greate cauſe haue we to do good whileſt God giueth vs reſpite, & whileſt opportunity ſerueth. For we are taught by the prophet ye we cannot be coūted for good & fruitful trées, vnleſſePſal. 1. we bringe footh fruite in dwe ſeaſon. A good trée doth not only bringe forth good fruit: but alſo it bringeth it foorth in due & cōueniēt time. So if we wil be counted good Chriſtiās we muſt do good whileſt opportunitye ſerueth. The good Samaritane mētioned of in ye
               Luck. 10. Goſpel, did good while opportunity did ſerue, and when occaſion was offered.

For ſo ſone as he ſawe the man that was fallē into ye hands of theues, lying by the way ſide ſore beaten and wounded, he was ſtraight way moued wt cō
               paſſion on him, in ſomuch yt he went vnto him, boūde vp his wounds, powred wine & oyle into them, layde hym vpō his beaſt, caried him to his Inne, and made prouſion for him. But the Preiſt and ye 
               Leuite had ye ſame occaſiō offered them to do good and to exerciſe theire charity towards theire neighbour, but they paſſed by & would not do good when occaſiō ſerued thervnto. So likewiſe whē poore Lazarus laie at ye gate of Diues, with a naked body & anLuc. 16. empty belly, crauinge to be refreſhed with the ſmal crūmes that fell from his table, there was occaſion offered vnto him to do good, but he would not do good when he might, & bringe forth fruite in dwe ſeaſon, therefore he was cut downe as an vnfruitful trée, and caſt into the fyre, and his ende was euerlaſtynge myſerye withoute all hope of mercy. Therfore let vs learne to do good whileſt we haue tyme, and

when we may. But alas although we are here told that it is time to awake out of ſléepe, to ariſe out of, the bedde of carnal ſecuritie, and to goe about our buſines, yet for al this we lye ſtill, wée are none of the haſtinges, yea, wée deferre our doinge well from one day to another, yea from one yere to another, that is to ſay, from henceforth for euer more. Such is our negligence and ſlownes in this behalfe. For we are in ſuch a deade ſléepe that wee awake not, for all the noyſe and callinges that is made and vſed euery daye. The preachers crye out & ceaſe not, they exalt their voyces like trumpetes, and call vnto vs euery daye for amendment of lyfe: ſayinge with S. Paule, aryſe thou that ſléepeſt and

And therfore I fear me that many of vs ſhall dye in our ſinnes without repentaunce, and haue our ſoules buried in hell, to euerlaſtinge paine, which if we woulde awake and aryſe from ſinne, ſhoulde

dwell in heauen to euerlaſtinge lyfe. And truely we that be heare in thys country, be of all others, I feare me, frutheſt of frō ſaluacion. For although the trumpet of gods word doe dayly ſounde in our eares, and although we haue ye blacke cloudes of darkenes and ignoraūce driuen away from vs by ye ſhininge light of the goſpell, yet for all this we walke not as the childr

               e of light, but are to wel acquainted, and ouer much occupied, in the vnfruitfull workes of darkenes: for howe can we be ſaide to be the childrne of light, when as no fruit of godly life appeareth in all our doinges, and when our déeds be ſuch towards our neighbours that they ſhewe and declare there is nothinge but doung and poyſon in our hartes? And howe can wée be ſaide to be awake, when as we lye ſtill buried in ſin, drowned in vice, & ſéeinge that we daily commit ſuch déedes, as ſti

            The wicked Iewes which had crucified Chriſt, harkeninge to the ſermon of Peter, began to awake out of thys deadly ſleépe of ſinne, when as they began to be pricked in the harte, and to ſay vnto Peter & the other apoſtles:Act.

                  . Men and bretheren what ſhall we do: which examples doe teache vs, y• men are then ſaid to be awake, and to ariſe out of the ſléepe of ſinne, when as they are hartely ſory, for the ſinne cōmitted, and bringe forth the fruit of repentaunce. Thus you ſée what is ment by ſléepe and ariſing from ſléepe. And truely it ſhould ſéeme that the apoſtle doth vſe this Metaphor, of ſléepinge and wakinge, and of night and day, that we might haue good occaſions, to muſe and thinke of theſe thinges, as oft as we ſée the ſonne 
                  •
               o ariſe, and as oft as we awake out of ſléepe, and riſe out of our beddes.
            For euen as it is the parte of a good

huſband not to ſlugge and ſlepe in his bedde, when as the daye appearinge offereth vnto him good occaſion to ariſe and to go about his buſines, but to get vp with all conuenient ſpéede, and to goe about ſuch thinges as are néedeful to be done: So chriſtian men, which haue any care of their owne ſaluation ought not to let ſlip the good opportunitie to do good, offered to them of god: but they ought to ſhewe them ſelues readye and diligent to doo thoſe things yt God hath cōmaunded by his worde. An other reaſon which he vſeth to perſwade vs to ariſe nowe out of this deadly ſléepe, is bicauſe our ſaluation is nearer, then when we beleued it. By which reaſon he ſheweth that it had haue to ſmall purpoſe, to tel vs of theſe thinges and to haue exhorted vs to holineſſe of life, before we did beleue in Chriſt, and had the knowledge of the truth.
            But ſéeing that our ſaluation is nowe nearer then it was in time paſt, we ought in no wiſe to neglect thys occaſion.
            
               By ſaluation he meaneth that full and perfect ſaluation, and bleſſedneſſe, which we ſhalbe parſakers after this lyfe.
            So that the ſence and meaninge of Paule is that our fall and perfect ſalutation, is nowe nearer then it was longe ag
                  •
               e, and when we did ſyrſt begyn to beléeue. For as without ſayth, & beleefe in Chriſt there is no hope of ſaluation, no remiſſion of ſinnes, no eternall lyfe to be looked for: ſo heauen and eternall lyfe beginne then to appeare, when 
                  ••
               yrſt God giueth a hart to beléeue, and eyes to ſée the waye to moſt bleſſed immortalytie. And the more that our fayth encreaſeth, and the more that we profit in the knowledge of God, the nearer, and nearer, doo we drawe towardes heauen, and moſte bleſſed ſaluation. When as a man diggeth in a gold myne, the déeper he diggeth the nearer he commeth to gold. The further that the trauayling man goeth on his way, the nearer he commeth to his iournies ende.

So the moſt happy & perfect ſaluaſion, that we ſhall enioy after thys mortal life, is nearer vnto vs thē whē we firſt beleued. For when as we began firſt to beleue, then did we begin to ſet forward in our rate & iourneye, & to goo towards heuē, but now we haue gon a great way in our iorney, & euery day draweth nearer & nearer ye day of our deth. At which time our ſouls ſhal be caried vp into heauē. Again we are now nearer to ye day of iudgemēt, and ye world is nearer an end thē it was mani a yere agoe. At which time chriſt ſhall raiſe vp our bodyes out of ye duſt, and make vs partakers of that kingdom whereof his bleſſed body is pertaker1. Cor. 15. of all redy. For then ſhall mortalyty, put on immortality, & corrupcion, incorrupciō, & then may we be bould to ſay, O death wher is thy ſtynge? O hel where is thy victory? And truely the conſideracion of this full and perfecte ſaluacion, whych is nowe nearer, then when we firſt beleued, ought to moue vs to leade a holy and Godly lyfe, leaſt yt through our ſlouthe

and necligence, we loſe it and giue teſtimony to the worlde, that it doth not appertaine vnto vs.
            For our necligence muſt néedes be accounted horrible, and ſhamefull, if we now leaue of to ſerue GOD, when as we haue but a ſhort tyme to liue, and be at the very poynt to take poſſeſſion of heauen.
            The longer we liue, and the nearer that we approch to death, the more earneſt we ought to be to ſerue God, and the longer that we haue hard the Goſpel, and beleued in Chriſt, ſo much the more earneſt wée ought to be to obey the Goſpell. And therefore ſéeinge that we haue harde the Goſpell many yeares in this Realme of England, the more deligent we ought to be to ſerue God, and to liue vprightly, and to ſhewe foorth by our lyfe, & conuerſation, that we be dooers of ye word and not hearers onely, deceauinge ourIa. 1. owne ſelues.
            A prentice in ſeuen yeares wil learne his occupation, and be able to doo hys maiſter good ſeruice, and he will be

more ſhylful the ſecond yeare then the fyrſt, and ſo euery yeare better than another.
            The lyttle chyldrne that goe to the Schole goe forwarde in learninge, & in thrée or foure yeres will not onelye be able to reade, but alſo to write and to ſpeake lattine.
            But alas we haue gonne to ſchole not ſeuen yeares, but eighttene yeares, we haue had many notable Scholemaſters and teachers, and yet for all this wée be little amended, but like very blockheades we tary ſtyll in our ould leſſons, and will not take forth into good manners and newe conditions. Yea we are more ſlowe to heare Gods worde, and to frame our liues thereafter, then we were whē it was firſt preached. And we go rather backward then forward.
            And what a reproche, and ſhame is it for vs, to be more ſlowe, to ſerue God then we were in the beginning, conſidering we haue taſted of his mercye and grace, ſo longe, and ſo many yeres together, and that in ſuch ſorte,

that we may iuſtly ſay, Non taliter fecit omni nationi: He hath not dealt ſo with any nation, as he hath dealtPſal. 147. with vs.
            You knowe that they which runne for a wager, that the nearer they draw to the marke, the faſter they runne, and they make the more ſpéede.
            So, the longer that we haue harde the Goſpel, and the longer that we haue beléeued, ſo much the holier we ought to be in life and conuerſation.
            And truely if ther were no other reaſon to perſwade vs, yet conſideringe (as I haue ſayd already) that our lyfe is ſhorte, and death knocketh at the dores, and the daye of Iudgement commeth on ſo faſt, that we may looke for it euery houre, we ought to be perſwaded to liue vprightly, and to walk as it be commeth vs.
            But (alas) many at the firſt hearing of the Goſpell, ſhewed them ſelues zelous, and ready to folow it. But after a while they gaue ouer euen in the middeſt of their race, and waxed weary of well dooing.

And truely it appereth that ther hath bene many of theſe ſlydebackes in all ages, but yet I thinke neuer more than at this day. Kinge Aſa in the beginning of his raigne was zelous in2. Chro 16. aboliſhing of Idolatrie & in reſtoring of ſound religion, but at the length he began to waxe cold in the zeale of the Lorde, impriſoned Hananie the Sear for tellīg him of his fault, therfore frō that time forwarde he felt the ſmart and bitternes of warre, was ſtriken by the hand of God with an extreme diſeaſe in the féete; and at length taken away by death. Ioas likewiſe2. Chro 24 was a good Kinge in the beginninge of his raigne, and hée liued vprightly all the dayes of Iehoida the Prieſt, who was vnto him a faithful counſeller, & gouerned him by the worde of God, but when Iehoida was dead, he falleth to Idolatrie, and forgettinge the kindenes which Iehoida had done vnto him, ſlewe and ſ

Let theſe horrible examples moue vs to take heede, and to beware that we be not weary of well doing, leaſt we in the end periſh as they dyd. But let vs euery day, morning, & euening, riſinge and goinge to bed, conſider that our ſalutation, is now nearer then it was in times paſt, and that therefore we ought with a good courage to goe forward to doo our duties throughly, & to the ende, quietly to ſuffer that little trouble, that is behind. And euery day more and more to increaſe in faith, & to be more holy in lyfe.
            It followeth in the text, the night is paſſed and the daye is at hande. Here is an other reaſon to moue vs to lyue vprightly, and it differeth not much from that which he vſed before. For the night hée calleth the ignoraunce

of God and Chriſt, ye time of blindnes, & vnbelefe. By day he meaneth ye light of gods truth, by which truth Ieſus Chriſt the true ſonne of rightuouſnes doth appeare vnto vs. And therefore in ſayinge the night is paſſed, and the day is come on, he meaneth that ſéeinge we are not now ouerwhelmed with ye thick miſtes & cloudes of ignoraunce as the infidels, and vnbeléeuinge bée, and as we our ſelues were in times paſt, we ought to behaue our ſelues, as the childrne of the day and light, and not to ſléepe ſtill in ſinne with the wicked and vnbeléeuinge. And here by the way wée haue diligently to note and conſider, that Paule calleth the ignoraunce of Chriſt, and his goſpel, night and darknes, and cō
               pareth the vnbeléeuers to ſuch as bée faſt a ſléepe. And verie aptly and not without good cauſe, is the ignoraunce of Chriſt compared to night. For as in the night time, all thinges are couered with darknes, and as we cannot for want of light, knowe what is what, and diſcerne black from blew

and redde from ruſſet, yea ſometimes in ye night ſeaſon we thinke a buſhe to be a man, & a dead thing a liuing creature, for then as ye Poet ſaith, Eſt color omnibus vnus, all things ſeeme to be of one hue and coulor: ſo when wee were altogether ignoraunt in gods word & knewe not Chriſt, we did miſtake things & through igoraunce, we did ſo erre y• we accoūted ſuperſtiſion to be good deuotiō, & thought our ſelues highly in gods fauour, when as wée were faſt tied in ye diuells ſetters, and almoſt plunged into the pit of endles damnaciō. For without ye knowledge of gods word, we are ſo blind, that we cannot diſcerne betwene iuſtice and iniurie, protection & opreſſion, religiō and ſuperſtition, Chriſt and Antichriſt, good & euill. Paule himſelfe beinge ignoraunt of Chriſt, did wt great rage &Act. 9. crueltie perſecute his diſciples & thirſted after innocēt blood, & he himſelf cō

                  . a moſt holy father? Yea, we thought that God was delited wyth incenſe, perfume, waxcandles, golden copes, and veſtmentes, and we worſhipped thoſe thinges which our owne conſciences gaue vs to vnderſtande were no gods, we made no difference almoſt betwixt Chriſt & his creatures, wée confounded the ſigne with the thinge ſignified, & worſhipped a wafer cake which is a creture corruptible, in ſtéede of the maker of heauen and earth, & beleued it was the verie body of Chriſt, that was borne of the virgin Marye, and ſlaine for our ſinnes vpon the Croſſe.
            The cauſe of all which groſſe errors, was the ignorance of Chriſt and hys worde. For although ſome of the Papiſtes ſay, that ignorance is the mother of deuotion, yet it appeareth that it is the mother of all errour & ſuperſticion.
            
               And therfore verie aptly it is compared to the night and to ſléepe. For euen as one when as he is in ye night time faſt a ſléepe in his bedde, hath all his ſenſes ſo tyed vp, and bound, that hée cannot doe any thinge, and yet neuertheleſſe he dreameth ſometimes, and verily thinketh, yt he is dooing this & yt, ſo they which are ignorant of Chriſt, and his worde, haue al the powers of theire ſoules, ſo let and hindered, yt they cannot moue towardes heauen, or doe anie thinge yt can pleaſe God: although oftentimes they thinke they do god moſt noble ſeruice, whē as they commit moſt horriable and greuous crimes.
            But foraſmuch as it is nowe not night with vs, but day, let vs doe thoſe things that are ſéemely for them that haue the lyght, and followe the counſell of Paule, who wylleth vs to caſt away the workes of darknes, and to put on the armoure of lyght.
            By ye workes of darknes is ſignified ſinnes and naughtye vices, and they

are ſo called chiefely for two cauſes. The firſt cauſe is, bicauſe they procéede of the ignoraunce of gods word, and bicauſe wée are moued to doo them by the motion and inſtinct of Sathan, who is the prince of darkeneſſe. Secondly bicauſe they that commit naughti

                     ▪
                   lucem, he that doeth euill hateth the light. For whoremongers, théeues, murtherers, and wicked perſons commonly doo their feates in the darke, and in the night ſeaſon, and therefore ſaith Paul, Quae ab illis clam fiunt turpe eſt vell dicere, It is a ſhame euen ones to name thoſe thinges that are done of them in ſecrete.
            The darkenes of the night doth make them bold to commit ſinne, for they feare onely the eyes of men, and conſider not that the eyes of the Lord are vppon euery mans waies, & that with him ther is no darkenes at al, but yt the night is with him as the noone daye.

And therefore although men commit ſinne neuer ſo cloſely, yet doth god ſée them, and at length will reauele and bring it to lyght, as he dyd the whoredome of Dauid, and there is no wall ſo thicke, that can hide them that worke wickedneſſe, from the ſight of god. Let vs therefore caſt away the workes of darkenes, and put on the armoure of light. By the armoure of light he vnderſtandeth good workes, bicauſe they procéede of faith, and of ye true knowledge of god, and ſhine before men to the honor & praiſe of our good god, who worketh them in vs by his holy ſpirit. But here it may be demaunded why Paule doth call vices and ſinnes the workes of darkeneſſe, & good workes the armoure of light. Truely, you knowe that our fleſh is prone ynough and inclined of it ſelf to follow naughtineſſe, and in committing ſinne we take great pleaſure, and thinke it no payne at all to doo wickedly.
            But if we begin ones to ſerue God, & to frame our liues according to ye rule of his word, then muſt we ſtriue and

take great paines, and there is a battell ſet before vs, full of great labour and perill: In which battell we muſt fight againſt Sathan, the inticem

Chriſt himſelfe doth admoniſhe vs hereof in the Goſpell, whē as he telleth vs y• the way to heauen is ſtrayt and narrow, and the crowne of lyfe cannot be obtayned without paynes taking. And we ſée dayely by experience, that they which giue themſelues to ſerue God, to be ſubiect to ſclaunders and reproches, to be beſet on euery ſide with

All which places do ſufficiētly proue that it is not inough for vs to abſteine from euill, but alſo we muſt doe good. And therefore here wée may ſée that they vſe vnſéemely ſpeaches, which ſay, what ſhoulde we giue our ſelues to holynes? Or why ſhould not wée folowe our pleaſures, if wée be of the elect and choſen of GOD, we ſhall be ſaued, howſoeuer wée liue? if we be reprobates & caſt awaies we ſhall be damned whatſoeuer we doe? As though ye election of god did giue leaue vnto men to doe wickedlye, when as it is playne by the teſtimonye of S. Paule that wée are choſen in Chriſte not to liue loſelye, but that we ſhouldEpl

And therefore although good workes be not the cauſes of our ſaluation, yet ſéeinge that the ende of our election is that wée ſhoulde liue vprightly and lead a godly lyfe, let vs not onely abſtayne from euill, but

alſo doe good workes that they may ſerue as witneſſes to confirme our election, and that we may in ſo dooinge ſhewe our ſelues to be the ſhéepe

                Chriſt who doo not onely heare hisIohn 10. voice but alſo follow him. For S. Paule here in this place doth plainely tell vs, that we cannot bée reckened for gods ſeruauntes, vnleſſe wée walke honeſtly as in yt day. In which words I haue to note vnto you, & to ſay ſome thing of thys worde walkinge, bicauſe it is very life both in the olde, & newe teſtament: and the Lorde dooth vſe it often times to giue vs to vnderſtande, howe wée ſhould order and frame our lyfe. For then are we ſaide to walke honeſtly as it becommeth vs, when as we liue vprightly and withdrawe our ſelues from euill.
            Herevpon the Prophet often tymes in his boke of Pſalmes goinge about to liue vprightly doth vſe this worde walke. In ye firſt Pſal. he ſaith, Bleſſed is that man that walketh not in the counſell of the vngodly. &c.
            And in the. 119. Pſal. he ſayth, Bleſſed

are they that are ſound in the way, & walke in the lawe of the Lorde, by which two places it appeareth that to liue vprightly, & honeſtly, is nothing els but to walke in the lawe of the Lorde. For if a man liue after hys owne ſwynge he ſhall do nothing els but wander out of the right way, and doe thoſe thinges which are neyther ſéemely nor honeſt. Paule ſettinge downe certaine preceptes concerning maners, and chriſtian life, ſaith I pray you walke worthye of the vocationEphe. 4. Col. 1. wherevnto you are called. And Collo. i. he willeth vs to walke worthie of the Lorde, to pleaſe him in al things, and to be fruitfull in all good workes. So it appeareth that it is not inough for a man to walke vnleſſe hée walke honeſtly as in the day. For though all men doe walke, yet doe not all men walke noneſtly, and in the lawe of GOD, or daye light as they ſhould doe.

which cōmit wickednes in the night, and when true men are at reſt and in their beddes. Some other there bée that walke in darknes for they haue not the true knowledge of Chriſt, and of his worde, but are vtterly ignorāt in matters pertaininge to GOD, and to their ſaluation.
            Such walkers were the filthye and polluted Gentils when as they lay drowned in all kinde of filthines and ſuperſtition, in which they continued vntill Chriſt, ſent hys ſeruauntes toMat. 22. call them to bée partakers of the heuē
               ly marriage. Such walkers bée the Turkes, which ſlatly deny Chriſte, & the goſpell ſéekinge for life and ſaluation by the Alcoran.
            
            Such be the Iewes which ſéeke for ſaluation by the lawe and deny Chriſt which was borne of the virgin Mary, to bée the ſonne of God, and the true Meſſias.
            Such walkers alſo be the papiſtes for they make ye paineful paſſion of Ieſus Chriſt the high ranſome of our ſoules

and the onely meanes which god hath vſed to worke our ſaluation by, to be voyde and of none effect, by bearinge themſelues in hand, that they are able to purchaſe the realme of Paradice, by their owne merites. For they walke after theyr owne fanſies, & trangreſſe the lawe of God for their owne traditions. Some other there be yt walk, but they walke not honeſtly as in the day, for they walke after the fleſhe, & not after the ſpirit. Such walkers as theſe, are they which delite in nothing but in ſinne, and wickedneſſe, & which take leaue to dooe naughtily, neuer ſtryuing againſt theyr own luſtes and wicked affections, but ſuffering ſathan (the enimie of our ſaluation and welfare) to hale them from one vice to another, euen to theyr own deſtruction. Such a fleſhly walker was Abſolon, whoſe luſt was ſo outragious, that he defiled his fathers wyues in the ſight of all Iſrael.
            
            And ſurely as long as men walk after the fleſhe, and after the maner of this world, which is altogether ſet

vpō miſchiefe, they ſhall euery day become worſe & worſe, & their deſire wil be nothinge els but to drawe others into the ſame ſinke of ſinne, whereinto they thēſelues are alredy fallen. And theſe that walk after this faſhiō, walke diſorderly, and they walke in horrible confuſion, and in that brode way that leadeth to hell and endleſſe damnation.
            An other kinde of walkers there bée, which walke honeſtly as in the day, and theſe be they which liue not after their owne ſwinge, and let loſe y• bridle to vices, but ſuffer them ſelues to bée gouerned by the word of GOD, and walke accordinge to his lawe. And theſe bycauſe they walke accordinge to the pure word of God, they doe thoſe thinges that are comely & honeſt. They ſpende their liues wholly in gods ſeruice, and withdrawe thē
               ſelues as much as is poſſible from all euill. For they doe not walke as the wordlinges doe, which euery day become worſe and wofe, but they ſette GOD alwayes before their eies, and

haue a reſpect to his preceptes bicauſe they know they cannot doe any thing that can eſcape his ſight.
            Of this walkinge ſpeaketh god himſelfe in Gene. Wheras he commaundethGene. 17. 
               Adraham to walke before him and to liue vprightly, and truely we ſhall neuer walke hnoeſtlye as wée ſhould doe vnleſſe we ſet the Lorde before our eies, and thincke that we liue ſtill in his ſight.
            Many doe glory of the multitude and boaſt thmſelues to be holy and religious men, bicauſe they liue as the moſte doe, and walke after the manners and couſtomes if theyr forefathers, but yet the holye ghoſt dothe here tell them, that they ſhall neuer walke honeſtlye vnleſſe they ſeperate them ſelues from men, and frame theyr liues accordinge to the lawe of GOD.
            Here vpon it is ſayde that Enoch walked with GOD bicauſe he was not peruerted by the euill example of others, and although the world, when as he liued, was as corrupt as myght

            The ſecond part ſetteth down what2. Partes. we muſt ſhunne and auoid if we will liue vprightly and walke honeſtly. The thinges that we muſt ſhun, be gluttony and dronkenneſſe, chambering & wantonnes, ſtrife and enuying. For whoſoeuer they be that are infected with theſe vices, walk diſorderly, and their lyfe is odious and hatefull in the ſight of God. And although many men doe thinke theſe to be no vices, or at leaſtwiſe ſmal faultes, yet the Apoſtle doth condemne them for horrible and gréeuous ſinnes, and doth playnly tell vs that ther is no honeſty nor any feare of God in them, that ſpend their liues in theſe vices. But let vs examine theſe vyces, and ſpeake of them orderly as they lye in

the texte, and then ſhall we better iudge whether they bée ſinnes or no.
            The firſt, is gluttony and dronkenneſſe, the which two vices, are to common at this daye in this realme, and for the moſt part, they are committed at prodigal faſtes, and banquetes, and at ſuche tyme as this is (I meane Chriſtmas). For in Chriſtmas tyme and at great feaſts, gluttons and dronkerdes thincke they maye eate and drinke as much as they will, and that it is lawfull for them to ſpeake and doo whatſoeuer they thinke good. Behold them therefore, and you ſhall ſée them to paſſe the bandes of all meaſure, & to commit ſuch diſorders as though there were no iudge in Heauen, nor hell to ſwallowe vp wicked men after this mortall life.

If any man yet thinke that dronkēnes is no ſinne, then giue me leaue, to tel you in fewe wordes what miſchiefes and inconueniences procéede thereof.

was cut of in his dronkennes by the hand of Iudeth.

            Therfore truely ſaith Salomon, toPro. 24. whom is woe, to whom is ſorrowe, to whom is ſtrife, to whom is murmering, to whom are woundes without cauſe, to whom is rednes of the eyes? euen to them that tarie longe at the wine.
            
               It alſo bringeth mē vnto whordome, and into great daunger. For ye eyes of dronkerdes ſhal looke vpon ſtraūge women, and theyr hart ſhal ſpeake proude thinges, and they ſhall bée as they that ſleepe in the top of a maſt of a ſhippe
            Though the Lord ſpeake vnto them and ſay, awake oh ye drōkerdes, wéepe and houle, all ye that drinke wine vnmeaſurably, yet are they nothing moued there with, for it were almoſt as good to ſpeake to a deade man as to a dronkerde.
            Secondly, the mynde is marred, and ſore hurt by it, for dronkerdes commonly are ſtricken with the ſpirite of blockiſhenes, and they are like vnto madbedlomes, and men that haue loſt their wittes. It maketh them like vnto bruit beaſtes takinge away from them all theyr wit, reaſon and vnderſtandinge.
            Verily it woulde be a pitious ſight to ſée a man to take hys knife to cut of his owne fingers and to caſt them from him.
            
               But a dronkerde taketh away from himſelfe his owne witte, reaſon, yea,Eccle 19. and the very minde it ſelfe. Herevppon ſayth the wiſe man that wine taketh away the harte of man, and leadeth wiſemen out of the way.

            And truely we ſée this confirmed dayly by many examples.
            Theſe men are no great purchacers of landes, nor men of great reuenewes, and many which haue bene lefte very welthye by theyr fathers wills, haue conſumed all that hath bene left them, and died very beggars. For they ſpende much abrode with ſhame, vpō their owne bellies, which they might ſpare by varying at home, wt honeſtie.

Manye there be that ſéeke to ſpoyle & robbe their enimies, and ſome ther be that will ſteale from their friends, but dronkerdes, robbe their owne wiues and childrne, and are moued with litle pitie and compaſſion towardes them. Here I knowe that theſe alehouſe knightes wil reply and ſay, that they ſpend nothinge but their owne. But to them that vſe ſuch ſpeache, I make this anſwer, that their mony is not their owne, but as the Prophet ſaith, it is the Lordes. Thou art butHag. 2. his ſtewarde, and he hath lent thée welth and riches, not to miſpende one farthing or mite vnthriftely, and vpon thinges not neceſſarie.
            God hath made the earth to bringe forth fruite, and hath made man lorde and kinge of all his creatures, but yet to vſe them, not to abuſe them. If God haue geuen vs riches, and ſent vs wealth he hath not giuen it vs to ſpende all vpon our owne carkaſes, but to helpe our wiues and childrne withall, to releaue the want of the

poore, to beſtowe ſome part of it vppon them which crie at our gates for releefe and comforte, and therfore if thou play the dronkerd, beſtowe all vpon thy ſelfe, thou playeſt the part of a ſtronge théefe, and robbeſt thy wife, thy childrne, & the poore needie neighboures, of yt which they ought to haue to comfort them withall.
            Wée muſt conſider alſo that GOD hath in his worde ſet downe how men ſhould vſe their riches, to whom one day we muſt giue account.
            For to euery one of vs it ſhall beLuk. 16. ſayde gyue account of thy ſtewardſhippe.
            If you ſend your ſeruaunte to the market you wil haue him to beſtowe your money, in ſuch ſorte as you doe commaunde him, and not at his owne pleaſure.
            So GOD hath giuen to men money and wealth, but yet therewithall he hath giuen vs a rule howe to beſtowe it.

            Thus you ſée our money is not our owne, to doe with it what our liſt, or to miſpend it in ryote and wantonnes, neither is it lawfull to eate and drink to muche, but ſo much as is méete and conuenient for vs. True it is y• GOD is not offended, with eatinge and drinking, but he is offended with vs, when as we abuſe eatinge and drinkinge and when as we deuour

            Truely I knowe right well that wée may vſe feaſting, one neighbour with another to maintaine mutual loue and friendſhippe, and I know that GOD would not alwaies haue vs to be ſad, but that he would haue vs to be merie and giueth vs wherwith to be merie.

Truely ther be ſome that will ſtoutly inough ſaye that they bée chriſtians, and they wyll beare men in hand that they loue GOD and his worde, they will not ſtick to come to the church to heare Sermons, and yet when they intend to be merie, they driue awaye al thought of GOD and of hys iudgmentes, and they are not content to doe ſoo onely, but they will not ſticke

               Rubin the ſonne of Iacob, ſéeinge hys fathers wyfe Billa bathinge hir ſelfe in a wel, had his minde ſo ſet vpon hir, yt he could not ſléepe & take reſt till he had cōmitted abhomination, for he ſéeinge hir lyinge a ſléepe in hir chamber vncouered, went in vnto hir and committed wickednes.
            But Ioſeph his brother walked not in the ignoraunce of youthfulnes and fornicatiō, neither could he be brought by his maiſtris the Egiptian woman, to defile his maiſters bed although ſhe vſed (as I ſayde afore) many meanes

to allure him therevnto.
            And therefore GOD ſo bleſſed him, that he found fauour both in the ſight of God and men. But, alas, fewe Ioſephes there bée at this daye, but wée finde many lyke vnto Rubin, which burning with the flame of luſt and concupicence, doe nothinge elſe, but lye in wayte and watch how they may defile other mens beds.
            And bicauſe this vice, is not reſtraned by ſharpnes of lawes, manye thinke that there is no office at al in whorehuntinge, ſuppoſinge it to bée a ſporte, to robbe virgins and wiues of their honeſſye, which ought to be eſtéemed of more pryce and valewe then anye golde.
            But if we will iudge vprightly of whoredome, wée muſt not iudge of it as many doe, which with braſen faces and impudent mouthes wyl ſay, tuſh, what is whoredome? it is but a trick of youth, a paſtime, a dalliaunce, a veniall ſinne, and a light faulte.
            Alas, alas, theſe wordes will goe for no payment, and theſe excuſes will

not excuſe them, when as the lawe of god & their owne giltie conſciēces ſhal accuſe them in the day of iudgement. At which time the Lorde will rewarde them accordinge to theire déedes. Then ſhall they knowe that it is ſome thing to break the lawe and commaūdement of GOD, who ſaith thou ſhalt not commite whoredome, then ſhall they know how vile a thing it is to defile their bodies, which ought to be houſes and temples for the holy ghoſt to dwell in.
            
               S. Paule ſaith, that all other ſinnes are without the bodie, but he that committeth whordome ſinneth againſt his owne bodye, and yet men will haue it to be no ſinne.
            If one man robbe another of his goods, he is ſtraight way puniſhed, and méete it is he ſhould ſo bée.
            But whoredome is more then a ſimple robberie, for by it men are ſpoyled not onely of their ſubſtance, but alſo of their honour, honeſtie, & ſometimes of their liues.
            If a tenaunt kéepe not the couenauntes

that are agréed vpon betwixt himſelfe and his Landlord, he ſhall be ſure to ſmart for it. But marriage is a holy leage & couenaunt, and the man doth promyſe to the woman and lykewyſe the woman to the man that they wilbe true and faythfull eche to other, and this promiſe is made before God and his Churche, and yet the breakinge of it is thought to be nothing.
            But if men would conſider howe they doe by whoredome tranſgreſſe the lawe of god, vnhalow ye temple of god, & his holy ſpirit, breake their promiſe made in the preſens of god, and his angles, make ſhipwrack of their honeſty, ſet fire to their own bodyes, and bryng diſtruction to their ſoules, they would ſhunne whoredome more then they doe.
            If theſe reaſons will not perſwade you that whoredome is a horrible ſinne in the ſigh of God, then 
                  •
               all to mynde what hath bene the ende of all them in all ages which haue ſpent their liues in this filthy vice.
            
               The people that liued in the firſte age which ſpente theyr tyme in whoredom, wer ſodaynly caught with the vengeaunce of God, and drowened.
            For the whole vniuerſall worldeGen. 7. was ouerflowede with water for whoredome.
            The Sodomites beinge giuen to thisGen. 19. vice were conſumed with▪ heauenlye fire. We reade that foure and twenty thouſand periſhed for whordome, the Iudges were hanged vp agaynſt the ſunne. What happened for rauiſhing of Dina the daughter of Iacob, andGene. 34. howe that facte was reuenged the 34. chapter of Gen. dothe playnelye declare. Sainct Paule ſaith that whoremongers and adulterers the LordeHeb. 13. will iudge.
            In the reuelation of Iohn we readeAp. 22. that they that kéepe the commaundementes of God, ſhall goe to heauen, and ther raign eternally with Chriſt, but whoremongers ſhalbe ſhut out, and be caſt into ye lake which flameth with fire and brimſtone.
            
               Now if god ſpared not ye whole world, if he ſhowered downe fier and brimſtone from heauen, vpon Sodom and Gomorra, if foure and twentye thouſand were deſtroyed and all for whordome, let vs not thinke that he will ſpare this realme of Englande, if we continue ſtill from one yeare to another in whoredome, neuer finding anye time to repent. Wherefore as many as will liue vprightly and walke honeſtly, muſt deteſt & abhorre this vice.
            And to the end that we be not defiled therewith, we muſt banniſhe queanes and harlottes and not ſuffer them to eate our breade, and to lodge within our gates.
            A ſerpent is a daungerous thinge to be kept in a mans boſome, and we cannot dayly kéepe companye with euill perſens without great daunger, he that toucheth piche ſhalbe defiled.
            Therfore he that will liue vprightly muſt ſhunne whordom & all things that are prouocations therevnto.
            
               The third thinge that we muſt ſhunne, is ſtrife and enuyinge, vnder which two names is comprehended al thinges that ſtriue againſt brotherly loue, and godly peace and quietnes.
            For out of al doubt, good agréemēt and freindſhippe amongeſt men, is as pleaſaunt a thinge vnto God as can bée. Therefore ſaith the pſalme. Ecce quā bonum et quam iucundum habitarePſal 13

                     . fratres in vnum. Beholde howe good and ioyfull a thinge it is, brethrne to dwell together in vnitie, it is like the dewe that fell downe from heauē vpon the grounde to giue noriſhment vnto it, and like vnto ye oyle that dropped downe from Aarons bearde, ſo as the ſent of it was ſhed ouer all his raiment.
            Whereby it plainely appeareth that god loueth peace and amitie amongeſt men, and is well pleaſed when one embraceth an other with hartie loue. S. Paule therefore here doeth exhorte vs to loue, and telleth vs that we can not liue vprightly if wée be readye to

ſnatch at one another like cattes and dogges, and to cut one anothers throte. And yet neuertheleſſe ther are ſome ſo giuen to diſſention and quarrelinge, that they care not what miſcheife they commit, ſo that they may ſatiſfie their cruell hartes and luſtes of reuenginge.
            And whereas we are commaunded to ouercome euill with goodnes, and if our enimy honger to féede him, if hée thirſt to giue him drinke.
            Yet are we ſo farre from performing of it, that at euery litle and ſmall trifle we are readye to goe to the lawe, to drawe out our ſwordes, and to fyght it out one with an other.
            But if we woulde a litle conſider, the fruites that ſpringe out of enuie, contencion, brawlinge, chidinge, and ſuch like, or if we could now open our eies and looke vpon the warres, that are inflamed throughout al chriſtendome, the bodies that haue bene ſlaine, the bloud that hath bene ſpilt, and the Cities, Townes, and Kingdomes, that

haue bene rent and torne in ſunder, through enuie and contencion, it were ynough to moue vs, to hate and deteſt this vice aboue all others. Let vs thē a litle conſider the fruites that ſpring out of this trée.
            Firſt if a man be enuious, or at debate with his neighboure he cannot eate and drinke in reſt, he is alwayes readie to hurt and harme the partie whom he enuieth, he reioyceth at his fall, and pyneth away at his proſperitie. Agayne, we ſée howe diueliſhe men become when they are once chaſed.
            For they are then readye in furious wiſe, to runne headlonge into deſtruction, then they ſuffer theyr naughty affections to haue the brydle and to ouermaiſter all wyt and reaſon.
            Yea and though they bée neuer ſoo wyſe, yet in theire anger they will beehaue them ſelues lyke verye fooles.
            For is not hée a verye foole whiche wyll goe about to make the fyer to

burne better which is kindled to much alreadie.
            If a man ſée hys houſe on fyer he will crye out ſtraight way for water: but if he féele him ſelfe ſet all on fyer with enuie hée ſéeketh not to quench it, but putteth more matter vnto it to make it to burne the more.
            Wherefore Paule doth tell vs that wée cannot pleaſe GOD vnleſſe we ſhake of all ill wyll, and treade all ſtrife and contencion vnder foote.
            And here wée haue to note, that although he ſetteth downe ſtrife before enuye, yet in order is enuie firſt and the ſpringe heade as it were from whence ſtryfe and contencion ſloweth. What is the cauſe yt one ſéeketh the ouerthrowe of another?
            Marry the enuie and ſpight that one beareth towardes a nother.
            Sathan enuyinge that good and happye eſtayte of our fyrſt parentes wasGene 3. neuer contente vntyll he had brought them out of felicitie into greate myſerye.

            The ſonnes of Iacob beinge moued with enuye ſold Ioſeph, and went about to deſtroye him. Saule enuied Dauid, and would haue killed him vnles that GOD had delyuered him out of his bloudy handes.

            Wherein fyrſt we haue to conſider howe that the apoſtle calleth Chriſt a garment.
            This ſimilitude of clothinge and allegorie of garmentes is often vſed in the holy ſcriptures

            For Chriſt is the white rayment and apparell ſpokē of in the Apoca. which doth hide and cloth our filthy nakednſſe, that it doth not appeare. And he is y• apparell which we are cōmaunded to kéepe, leaſt we walke naked, and men ſée our filthynes.
            He that hath put on this garment, needeth not to ſéeke for any other thinge to couer and hyde his ſinnes: and whoſoeuer he be that hath not put on Chriſt, is odious and hatefull in the ſight of God.

            True it is that wicked luſtes and ſinfull affections, will alwayes dwell in vs, ſo longe as wée lyue in this worlde, and therefore it béehooueth vs, alwayes to kéepe good watch and warde, and to bée in a readyneſſe to fyght agaynſt them, and in any wiſe to take héede that we ſuffer them not to haue the maiſtery ouer vs.

            Whereby it appereth that he intreateth not here of the ſubſtaunce of the fleſh, but onely of the corruptions thereof, by which we are drawne to ſinne, and ſo from God.
            Wée muſt haue a care, to prouide rayemente for our bodies, but wée muſt not haue a care to cloth them wantonlie, and to praunce vp & downe in pride and brauery, we muſt prouide for our ſelues meate and drinke, and alſo for our families, but yet we muſt eate and drinke ſoberlie, and doe it in ſuch ſort as we ought to doe, otherwiſe we fulfill the luſtes of the fleſh. But how is this counſell of Paule folowed at this day? truely nothing at all.
