Being, CERTAINE EGLOGS written during the time of the Authors Imprisonment in the Marshalsey.

            TO THOSE HONOVRED, NOBLE, AND RIGHT Vertuous Friends, my Visitants in the Marshalsey: AND, TO ALL OTHER, MY VNKNOWNE FAVOVRITES, who eyther piuately, or publiquely wished me well in my imprisonment.
            
               NOble Friends: you whose vertues made me first in loue with Vertue: and whose worths, made mee be thought worthy of your loues. I haue now at last (you see) by Gods

               t touch of deiected basenesse. Seeing therefore I was growne beyond my Hope so fortunate, (after acknowledgement of my Creators loue, together with the vnequall'd Clemency of so gracious a Soueraigne) I was troubled to thinke by what meanes I might expresse my thankfulnesse to so many well-deseruing friends: No way I found to my desire; neyther yet abilitie to performe when I found it. But at length considering with my selfe what you were, (that is) such, who fauour honestie for no second reason but because you your selues are good; and ayme at no other

reward but the witnesse of a sound conscience that you doe well, I found that thankfulnesse would proue the acceptablest present to sute with your dispositions; and that I imagined could be no way better expressed then in manifesting your courtesies, and giuing consent to your reasonable demands. For the first, I confesse (with thankes to the disposer of all things, and a true gratef

               VERTVE had farre more followers then I supposed.
            Somewhat it disturbed mee to behold our ages Fauourites, whilst they frowned on my honest enterprises, to take vnto their protections the egregiousts fopperics: yet much more was my contentm

Your Loue. is is that (enabling mee with patience to endure what is already past) hath made mee (also) carefull better to prepare my selfe for all future misaduentures, by bringing to my consideration, what the passion, of my iust discontentments had almost quite banished from my remembrance.

                     Fortune hath so much grace, to smile on thee.

                  To smile on me? I nere yet knew her smile,
                  Vnlesse 'twere when she purpos'd to deceiue me;
                  Many a Trayne, and many a painted wile
                  
                  She casts, in hope of Freedome to bereaue me:
                  Yet now, because she sees I scorne her guile
                  To fawne on sooles, she for my Muse doth leaue me,
                  And here of late, her wonted spite doth tend,
                  To worke me care, by frowning on my friend.

                  If we get any thing by all our parling
                  It seemes an Apple, but it proues a weilding:
                  
                  But let that passe; sweet Shepheard tell me this,
                  For what beloued friend thy sorrow is.

                  Or this thy ioy for my content beleeue:
                  When thou think'st thy cares touch not me as neere,
                  Or that I pinne thy sorrowes at my sleeue?
                  
                     Roget, my faith in thee hath had that trust,
                  I neuer thought to finde thee so vniust.

                  You cannot be but welcome where I am,
                  You euer were a friend of mine in show:
                  And I haue found you are indeed the same,
                  Vpon my first restraint you hither came,
                  And proffered me more tokens of your loue,
                  Then it were fit my small deserts should proue.

                  Thankes good Alexis; sit downe by me heere,
                  I haue a taske, these Shepheards know, to doe;
                  A Tale already told this Morne well neere.
                  With which I very fayne would forward go,
                  And am as willing thou shouldst heare it to:
                  But thou canst neuer vnderstand this last,
                  Till I haue also told thee what is past.

                     Roget it shall not need, for I presum'd,
                  Your loues to each were firme, and was so bold,
                  That so much on my selfe I haue assum'd,
                  To make him know what is already told:
                  If I haue done amisse then you may scolde.
                  But in my telling I preuised this,
                  Hee knowes not whose, nor to what end it is:

                  Well now he may, for here my Tale goes on,
                  My eager Dogges and I to Wood are gon,
                  Where beating through the Couerts euery Hound
                  A seuerall Game had in a moment found:
                  I rated them▪ but they pursu'd their pray,
                  And as it fell (by happe) tooke all one way.
                  Then I began with quicker speed to sollow,

                     az'd them on with a more cheerfull hallow,
                  That soone we passed many weary miles,
                  Tracing the subtile game through all these wiles.
                  These doubl'd, they redoubled on the sent,

                  They followed where so eu'r the game did goe
                  Through Kitchin, Parler, Hall, and Chamber too,
                  
                     And as they pass'd the City and the Court,
                  
                  My Prince look'd out, and daign'd to view my sport,
                  Which then (although I suffer for it now)
                  (If some say true) hee liking, did allow;

                  I might my selfe (perhaps) haue heard him say,
                  But I that time, as much as any daring,
                  More for my pleasure then my safety caring;
                  Seeing fresh game from euery loope-hole rise,
                  Crossing by thousands still before their eyes.
                  After I rush'd, and following close my Hounds
                  
                  Some Beastes I found lye dead, some full of wounds
                  Among the Willows, scarce with strength to moue
                  One I found here, another there, whom Loue

                     Grew the more frolicke, and the courses length
                  Gaue better breath, and added to their strength;
                  Which Ioue perceiuing, for Ioue heard their cryes
                  Rumbling amongst the Spheares concauities:
                  
                  He mark'd their course and courages encrease,
                  Saving, t'were pitty such a chase should cease;
                  And therewith swore their mouthes should neuer wast
                  But hunt as long's mortalitie did last.
                  Soone did they feele the power of his great gift,
                  And I began to finde their pace more swift:
                  I follow'd, and I rated, but in vaine,
                  Striu'd to o'retake, or take them vp againe;
                  They neuer stay'd since, neither nights nor dayes,
                  But to and fro still runne a thousand wayes:
                  Yea often to this place where now I lye,
                  They'l wheel about to cheere me with their cry;
                  And one day in good time will vengeance take
                  On some offenders, for their Masters sake:

                  What new accident there is,
                  That thou (once the blythest Lad)
                  Art become so wondrous sad?
                  
                     And so carelesse of thy quill,
                  As if thou had'st lost thy skill.
                  Thou wert wont to charme thy Flockes,
                  And among these rudest rockes

                  That I haue forgot my wrong.
                  Something hath thee surely crost,

                  Tell me, Haue I ought mis-said
                  That hath made thee illa-paid?

                     Shepheard, there full many be,
                  That will change Contents with thee.

                  Groues or fields may yeeld to man:
                  Neuer come to know the rest
                  Wherewithall thy minde is blest.
                  Many a one that oft resorts
                  To make vp the troope at sports,
                  And in company some while
                  Happens to straine sorth a smile:
                  Feeles more want, more outward smart
                  And more inward griefe of hart,
                  Then this place can bring to thee,
                  While thy minde remaineth free.
                  Thou condemn'st my want of mirth,
                  But what find'st thou in this earth,
                  Wherein ought may be beleeu'd,
                  Worth to make me ioy'd, or grieued?

                  Otherwhile as much of sorrow,
                  But my present state is such,

                  That were very much to grant.

                     Those that sing not must be sad?
                  Did'st thou euer that bird heare

                  There's a time to slacke the string,
                  And a time to leaue to sing.

                  Leaue me in exile alone.
                  Hye thee to that merry throng,
                  And amaze them with thy Song,

                  I with wonder heard thee sing,
                  At our last yeeres Reuelling.
                  Then I with the rest was free,

                     Yea, I saw the Lasses cling
                  Round about thee in a Ring:

                  And I know they yet doe long
                  For the res'due of thy song.
                  Haste thee then to sing it forth,
                  Take the benefit of worth.
                  And Desert will sure bequeath

                  It is knowne what thou canst doe,

                  Sitting by the Crimson streame.
                  Where, if thou didst well or no,
                  Yet remaines the song to show.
                  Much experience more I'ue had
                  Of thy skill (thou happy Lad)
                  And would make the world to know it;
                  But that time will further show it:

                  But how then wilt suit vnto
                  What thou shalt hereafter do?
                  Or I wonder where is hee,
                  Would with that song part to thee:
                  Nay, were there so mad a Swaine,

                  Where we see Detraction ly.
                  
                     For doe what I can, I doubt,
                  She will picke some quarrell out,
                  And I ost haue heard defended,
                  
                     Little said, and soone amended.
                  
               
            
            
               ROGET.
               
                  See'st thou not in cleerest dayes
                  Oft thick fogges cloud Heauens rayes?
                  And the vapours that doe breath
                  From the earths grosse wombe 
                        •…
                     e eath,
                  Seeme they not with their blacke steames,
                  To pollute the Sunnes bright beames,
                  And vet vanish into aire.
                  Leauing it (vnblemisht) faire?
                  So (my Willy) shall it be
                  With Detractions breath and thee.
                  It shall neuer rise so hie,
                  As to staine thy Poesie.
                  
                     As that Sunne doth oft exhale,
                  Vapours from each rotten Vale,
                  Poesie so sometime draines,
                  Grosse conceits from muddy braines;
                  Mists of Enuy, fogs of spight,
                  Twixt mens iudgements and her light:
                  But so much her power may doo,
                  That she can dissolue them too.
                  If thy verse do brauely tower,
                  As she makes wing, she gets power.
                  Yet the higher she doth sore,
                  Shee's affionted still the more:
                  Till she to the high'st hath past,
                  Then she rests with fame at last.
                  Let nought therefore thee affright,
                  But make forward in thy flight:
                  For if I could match thy Rime,
                  To the very starres l'de clime.
                  There begin againe and flye
                  Till I reach'd Aeternity.
                  
                     But (alas) my Muse is slow:
                  For thy pace she flagges too low:
                  Yes, the more's her haplesse fate,
                  Her short wings were clipt of late.
                  And poore I, her fortune ruing,
                  Am my selfe put vp a muing.
                  But if I my Cage can rid,
                  I'le flye where I neuer did.
                  And though for her sake l'me crost,
                  Though my best hopes I haue lost,
                  And knew she would make my trouble,
                  Ten times more then ten times double:
                  I would loue and keepe her to,
                  Spight of all the world could doe.
                  For though banisht from my flockes,
                  And confin'd within these rockes,
                  Here I waste away the light,
                  And consume the sullen Night,
                  She doth for my comfort stay,
                  And keepes many cares away.
                  
                     Though I misse the flowry Fields,
                  With those sweets the Spring-tide yeelds,
                  Though I may not see those Groues,
                  Where the Shepheards chaunt their Loues,
                  And the Lasses more excell,
                  Then the sweet-voyc'd Philomel,
                  
                  Though of all those pleasures past,
                  Nothing now remaines at last,
                  But Remembrance (poore reliefe)
                  That more makes, then mends my griefe:
                  She's my minds companion still,
                  Maugre Enuies euill will.
                  (Whence she should be driuen to,
                  Wer't in mortals power to do.)
                  She doth tell me where to borrow
                  Comfort in the mid'st of sorrow;
                  Makes the desolatest place
                  To her presence be a grace;
                  And the blackest discontents
                  Be her fairest ornaments.
                  
                     In my former dayes of blisse,
                  Her diuine skill taught me this,
                  That from euery thing I saw,
                  I could some inuention draw:
                  And raise pleasure to her height,
                  Through the meanest obiects fight,
                  By the murmur of a spring,
                  Or the least boughes rusteling.
                  By a Dazie whose leaues spred
                  Shut when Tytan goes to bed,
                  Or a shady bush or tree,
                  She could more infuse in mee,
                  Then all Natures beauties can,
                  In some other wiser man.
                  By her helpe I also now,
                  Make this churlish place allow
                  Somethings, that may sweeten gladnesse
                  In the very gall of sadnesse.
                  The dull loanesse, the blacke shade,
                  That these hanging vaults haue made,
                  
                     The strange Musicke of the waues,
                  Beating on these hollow Caues.
                  This black den which Rockes embosse,
                  Ouer-growne with eldest mosse.
                  The rude portals that giue light,
                  More to Terror then Delight.
                  
                  This my Chamber of Neglect,
                  
                  Wal'd about with Disrespect,
                  
                  From all these, and this dull aire,
                  A fit obiect for Despaire,
                  Shee hath taught me by her might
                  To draw comfort and delight.
                  Therefore thou best earthly blisse
                  
                  I will cheris

                  That ere Heau'n to mortals lent.
                  Though they as a trifle leaue thee

                  Then I am in loue with thee.
                  Though our wise ones call it madnesse,

                  There is no meaning thou thy charge forsake;
                  
                     Nor would I wish thee so thy selfe abuse

                  But let these two so of each other borrow,
                  That they may scason mirth, and lessen sorrow.
                  Thy flocke will helpe thy charges to desray,
                  Thy muse to passe the long and tedious day.

                  Thou in contentment shalt with Monarkes mate:
                  For mighty Pan, and Ceres to vs grants
                  Our fields and flockes shall helpe our outward wants.
                  The Muses teach vs songs to put off cares,
                  Grac'd with as rare and sweet conceits as theirs:
                  And we can thinke our Lasses on the greenes
                  As faire, or fairer, then the fairest Queenes;

               A Postscript To the READERS.
            
               IF you haue read this, and receiued any content, I am glad (though it be not so much as I could wish you,) if you thinke it idle, why then I see wee are not likely to fall out; for I am iust of your mindes: yet weigh it well before you runne too farre in your censures, least this proue lesse barren of wit then

you of courtesie. It is very true (I know not by what chance) that I haue of late beene so highly beholding to Opinion, that I wonder how I crept so much into her fauour, and (if I did thinke it worthy the fearing,) I should be afraid that shee hauing so vndeseruedly befriended me beyond my Hope or expectation, will, vpon as little cause, ere long, againe pick some quarrell against me: and it may be, meanes to make vse of this, which I know must needs come farre short of their expectation, who

by their earnest desire of it seem'd to be fore-possest with a farre better conceit then I can beleeue it proues worthy of. So much atleast I doubted, and therefore loath to deceiue the world (though it often beguile me) I kept it to my selfe, indeed not dreaming euer to see it published: But now, by the ouermuch perswasion of some friends, I haue beene constrayned to expose it to the generall view. VVhich seeing I haue done, Somethings I desire thee to take notice of. First, that I am Hee vvho to pleasure

my friend, haue fram'd my selfe a content out of that vvhich vvould otherwise discontent me. Secondly, that I haue coueted more to effect what I thinke truely honest in it selfe, then by a seeming show of Art, to catch the vaine blasts of vncertaine Opinion. This that I haue here vvritten, vvas no part of my study, but onely a recreation in imprisonment: and a trifle, neyther in my conceit fitting, not by me intended to be made common; yet some, and it should seeme esteeming it worthy more

respect then I did, tooke paines to copie it out, vnknowne to me, and in my absence got it both Authorized and prepared for the Presse; so that if I had not hindred it, last Michaelmas-Tearme had beene troubled with it. I was much blamed by some Friends for withstanding it, to whose request I should more easily haue consented, but that I thought (as indeed I yet doe) I should thereby more disparage my selfe, then content them. For I doubt I shall be supposed one of those, who out of their

arrogant desire of a little preposterous Fame, thrust into the world euery vnseasoned trifle that drops out of their vnsetled braines; whose basenesse how much I hate, those that know mee can vvitnesse, for if I vvere so affected, I might perhaps present the vvorld with as many seuerall Poems as I haue seene yeeres; and iustly make my selfe appeare to be the Author of some things that others haue shamefully vsurped and made vse of as their owne. But I will be content other men should owne

some of those Issues of the Braine, for I would be loth to confesse all that might in that kinde call me Father. Neyther shall any more of them, by my consent, in hast againe trouble the world, vnlesse I know which vvay to benefit it vvith lesse preiudice to my owne estate. And therefore if any of those lesse serious Poems which are already disperst into my friends hands, come amongst you, let not their publication be imputed to mee, nor their lightnesse be any disparagement to vvhat hath beene since

more seriously written, seeing it is but such stuffe as riper iudgements haue in their far older yeeres beene much more guilty of.
            I know an ▪indifferent Critticke may finde many faults as well in the sleightnesse of this present Subiect, as in the erring from the true nature of an Eglogue: moreouer, it altogether concernes my selfe, vvhich diuers may dislike. But neyther can be done on iust cause: The first hath beene answered already: the last might consider that I vvas there

vvhere my owne estate vvas chiefely to be looked vnto, and all the comfort I could minister vnto my selfe little enough.
            If any man deeme it worthy his reading, I shall be glad: if hee thinke his paynes ill bestow'd, let him blame himselfe for medling with that concerned him not; I neyther recommended it to him, neyther cared whether he read it or no, because I know those that vvere desirous of it, will esteeme the same as much as I expect they should.
            
               But it is not vnlikely, some vvill thinke I haue in diuers places beene more wanton (as they take it) then befitteth a Satyrist; yet their seueritie I feare not, because I am assured all that I euer yet did, was free from Obseaeuitie: neyther am I so Cynicall, but that I thinke a modest expression of such amorous conceits as sure with Reason, will yet very well become my yeeres; in which not to haue feeling of the power of Loue, were as great an argument of much stupiditie, as an ouer-sottish affection

were of extreame folly. Lastly, if you thinke it hath not well answered the title of the Shepheards Hunting, goe quarrell with the Stationer, who bid himselfe God-father, and imposed the name according to his owne liking, and if you, or he, finde any other faults, pray mend them.
            Valete.
            FINIS.
