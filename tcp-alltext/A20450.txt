            L. D. vnto the Reader.
            
               ALthoughe (gentle Reader) many excellente in
Geometry, vppon infallible groundes haue put
forth diuerſe moſt certayne and ſufficient rules,
touchyng the meaſuring of al maner Superficiecis:
yet in that the arte of numbring hath ben required (yea,
chiefely thoſe rules hyd, and as it were locked vp in ſtraunge
toungues) they do profite, or haue furdered verye lyttle the
moſte parte: certes nothing at al, the Landemeater, Carpenter,
or Maſon, wantyng the aforeſayde: for theyr ſakes I am
here prouoked not to hide, but to open, and ſo encreaſe the talent
which I haue receyued: yea, to publiſhe in this our tongue
very ſhortly (if God geue life) a volume conteynynge the flowers
of the Sciences Mathematical, largely applyed to our outwarde
practiſe, moſt profitably pleaſaunte to all maner men
of this realme. In the meane time I ſhall desire the Artificers
aboue named to be contented with this lyttle booke (a taſte of
my good wyll towardes them) which I wyſhe euen ſo to farder
the readers, as I knowe it ſuffycient for the true meaſurynge
and readye accompte of all maner Lande, Timber, Stoone,
Borde, Glaſſe, Pauemeut. &c.
            Here mine aduiſe ſhall be to thoſe Artificers that will profite
in this, or any of my bokes, nowe publyſhed, or that hereafter
ſhall be, firſt confuſely to reade them thorow, then with
more iudgement, and at the third reading wittely to practiſe.
So fewe thinges ſhalbe vnknowen. Note, oft diligent reding,
ioyned with ingenious practiſe, cauſeth profitable laboure.
            Thus moſt hartely farewell (louinge Reader) to whom I wiſhe my
ſelfe preſent to further thy deſire and practiſe in theſe.
         
         
            
            The pleaſaunt profite, or content of this lyttle boke.
And in what it exceadeth all other publyſhed.
            
               OTher Bokes tofore put forth in our engliſhe tongue
conteyned onely the bare meaſuring of Lande, Timber,
and Borde: howe agreable in all places to the
rules of Geometry, let the learned iudge. Here (gentle
Reader) thou ſhalt plainely perceiue through diligent
readynge, howe to meaſure truely and very ſpedely
all maner Land, Timber, Stone, Steaples, Pillers, Globes,
Borde, Glaſſe, Pauemente. &c. without trouble, not payned with
many rules, or obſcure termes. Nor yet with the multitude of tables,
as here before hath ben: in whiche not a fewe errours were
commytted: for that cauſe no iuſt accompte might any way be had.
Further ye ſhall by this booke vnderſtande the whole makinge and
comely handelynge of the Carpenters Ruler, with the true meaſures.
&c. And his vſe appoynted to the ready meaſuringe of all kynde
of Tymber, Stone, Borde. &c. Alſo the leauelinge of groundes, takinge
of Heightes, is pleaſauntly and diuerſely practiſed by the ruler.
Ye haue here not the commune but the rare vſe of the Squire
applied to Heightes, Lengthes. &c. and to the fyndinge of the iuſte
houre of the daye diuerſe waies: throughe the ayde of pleaſaunt tables,
newely adioyned to my generall Prognoſtication, by the which
the proporcion of thynges direct or ſquirewiſe ſtanding, are by theyr
ſhadowes knowen.
            To conclude, in the ende of this boke is added a treatiſe ſhewyng
the makynge and vſe of an Inſtrument, by whiche ye ſhall get Lengthes,
Heightes, Breadthes, wideneſſes, where, or howe ſo
euer they ſtande. Other neceſſary thinges are conteyned
in this lyttle volume, whiche I
commytte to the diligente
Readers.
         
      
      
         
            
            Diuerſe thinges conducible, to the arte of meaſurynge.
THE I. CHAPTER.
            
               
                  AS there are few crafteſmen, whiche
haue all the kyndes of Arithmetike readely:Characteres numerall.
ſo I doo ſuppoſe none ſo ignorant but
that they do, or maye eaſelye perceyue the
ſimple ſignifications of theſe Caracters or
figures. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 0. and alſo theyr
ſtrength, in the firſte, ſeconde, and thirde
roumes placed.
            Beſides that, they muſt be familiar with
theſe and ſuche like Fractions.
            ½ ⅓ 1/7 1/16 1/32 ¾ ⅘ 9/10 The firſte leftwarde betokeneth
one ſecōd parte
of an whole,Fractions. be it Pearche, Inche, or any other meaſure: the nexte,
one thyrde, then one ſeuenth parte: the other enſuyng, one ſixtenth.
So one thirty and two partes of an Inche. Thē folow thre fourthes:
four fiftes. The laſt is nine tenthes of an Inch: that is nine partes of
an Inch, diuided into ten porcions.
            Theſe I doo intend to put in my enſamples, and in my tables, and
margines folowinge, to repreſente partes of Pearches or Inches.
            As, if I woulde write halfe an Inche after this maner. ½. Thre quarters
of an Inche, thus. ¾ One eyght parte of a Pearche, on this wiſe.
⅛. So of the reſt.
            ¶It is requiſite alſo here to open what a Pearche, a Dayworke,
a Roode, and an Acre is.
            Althoughe there are diuers opinions engendred throughe longe
cuſtome in many places, of the length of a Pearch (vpon whiche our
chiefe matter dependethe) yet there is but one true Pearch, by Statute
apoynted to meaſure by. Wherin is ordeyned.

                  Breadthe.
                  Acre.
                  Lengthe.
               
3. barly cornes, drye, and rounde, to make an
Inche: 12. Inches, a Foote .3. Foote, a Yarde .5.
yardes and .½. a Pearche: 40. Pearches in lengthe,
and .4. in breadth, an Acre.
            So an Acre by ſtatute ought to conteine. 160
pearches: the halfe Acre .80. pearches: a Roode,
commonly called a quarter .40. pearches: a Day
worke .4. pearches. Loe here the Acre expreſſed
with his length and breadthe.
            
               
I muſt not omit here to tel you what thing is meteſt to meaſure
land with.Inſtrumentes to meaſuce with Poales Corde knotted. They vſe commonly in the country, two peales, eyther of
them the length of a pearch. They are very good.Profitable ſtaffe. Yet for al kinde of
lande, a corde .5. pearches in length, well ſeared with waxe & roſyn,
knotted or marked at the ende of euery pearche, is more mete & readier.
But in my fantaſy, the Inſtrument Geometrical, which is put
forthe in thende of this boke, paſſeth all them & other, for the exacte
truth, & quickeſt ſpede. This inſtrument is ſo general & auaylable to
ſo ſundry thinges, that it alone requireth a large boke, if it ſhoulde
be ſufficiently ſet forthe.
            Alſo I woulde not haue you ignorant what pece of lande is called
a Triangle,Triangle. which often ſhall hereafter be named. It is ſuche a faſhioned
piece as hath, or is imagined to

haue thre ſydes, and thre angels onelye:
whether the ſydes be equal or otherwyſe
as this figure ſheweth.Line fallinge ſquirewiſe. Againe, note that
a lyne is ſayde to fall ſquirewiſe, when it
cutteth any thinge, or any ſyde of a Triangle
full croſſe, lyke vnto a Squyre: As
the hanginge pricked line, a. b. in .c. d. the baſe line of the Triangle.
Loe, it cutteth the ſyde ſquyrewiſe, or full croſſe, in the point b. and
not as the other lyne a.Baſe line. e. dooeth. The Baſe of any tryangle is here
called that ſyde, whiche is cut ſquyrewiſe of the hanging lyne.
            Concerninge a Circle,Circle. knowe that the compaſſe of any circle,Circumferēce Center. is
named his circumference:Diametre. the myddle point in him his Centre:ſemidiametre Arcke. the
ryght lyne h.Paralleles. i. that goeth ouerthwart that

Centre, touchinge the circumference on
bothe ſydes, is his Diametre: the halfe of
that line, the Semidiametre. Alſo an arcke
is a pece of the circumference cut away, as
ye ſe the arcke aboue the lyne f. g. Alſo f. g.
and h .i. in this circle are named Parallels:
for that they differ equally in al places, the
one from the other.
            Nowe becauſe practyſe and experience ſheweth me, that there
is almooſte no lande, but it maye eaſelye be broughte by imagination,
to a Triangle or Triangles, and ſo mooſte truelye meaſured:
therfore to be ſhorte, this order ſhalbe taken. I wyll fyrſte fygure
and ſet afore your eyes Triangled Lande, and other whiche by imagination

ſhalbe brought into triangles. Then I ſhall teache the true
meaſuring of them: I meane how to finde a length & breadth, with
whiche ye ſhall enter the Table of accompt folowinge, where the acres,
and odde pearches, if there be any, ſhall appeare. As theſe fygures
are meaſured, ſo all tryangled land, and other, brought into
triangles, of what faſhion ſoeuer they be, ſhalbe meaſured, And becauſe
it is requiſite for true meaſuring of all triangles, to finde a
ſtreigth hanging line, I ſhall ſhewe firſte howe that Lyne is to be
founde, imagined, or drawen.
         
         
            Howe the right hanging line in Triangles
is drawen

               To drawe a hanginge or plumbe line.THis ſtreygth hanging lyne in all Triangles, is euer drawen or
imagined from any Angle, cuttinge ſome one ſyde of that triangle
ſquirewyſe: as ye may perceyue the pricked lynes in the
triangles folowing. By the helpe of this lyne, all landes of Triangle
faſhion, are brought to be meſured as enſueth.

            
         
         
            
            Howe to meaſure all maner Triangled Lande.
THE III. CHAPTER.
            
               IF thou be an Arithmetrician multiylie this ſtreigth hā
               ginge

               ber
of pearches of that ſyde which it cutteth ſquirewiſe.
For want of that knowledge, take the aforenamed pear
ches (I meane of the hanginge lyne, and halfe the ſyde
which he cutteth) and with that Length and breadthe enter youre
table of accompt, as there is ſet forth. So ſhall ye perceaue the nū
               ber
of Acres, Roodes, Dayworkes. &c.
            
               Enſample.
               FOr the perfect meaſuring of triangles afore fygured, and all
other, ſuppoſe the ſecōd of theſe laſte. 9. fygures on thother ſyde,
hauing written about it. a. b. c. d. to be a pece of land, whereof I
would haue the true meaſure. I fynde by a corde or otherwyſe, the
pricked hanging lyne a. d. to be. 23. Pearches: the ſyde b. c. whiche it
cutteth ſquirewiſe. 44. Pearches, whoſe halfe is. 22. With theſe. 22. &
23. the conuenient length and breadth, I enter the table of accompte.
There I fynde by that table, at the corner where bothe the lynes of
conunient length and breadth do mete .3. Acres, 6. Dayworkes, and
2. Pearches to be in that Triangle. Thus of all before fygured.
               Here note,This Table foloweth. your Table muſt euer be entred with al the pearches
of the hanging Lyne, and with halfe the ſide that he cutteth ſquirewyſe:
Or with the halfe hanging lyne, and the whole ſyde cut.
            
            
               A figure of a double
Triangle.
               
                  
               
               THis fygure e. f. g. h. is but two Triangles:

and therefore meaſured as aboue in two
partes: Or thus. The hangynge lyne,
e. g. is .33. Pearches: the ſyde. f. h. that he cutteth
ſquirewyſe .20. Pearches, the halfe of the
whiche is .10. Nowe enter your Table as afore,
with 33. and .10. the conueniente lengthe and
breadthe. So ſhall ye fynde, 2, Acres, 2, Dayeworkes
and, 2, Pearches, the true contente of
this fygrue, e, f, g, h,
            
            
               
               An other enſample.
               ADmit. i. k. l. m. lande to be meaſured. Becauſe it is no maner
Triangle, it muſt be brought by imagination, as I haue ſaied,
into a Triangle or triangles.Figures of many Angles. Which imagination is here ſignified

by the lyne daſhed. i. l. Then as aboue is declared, it ought to be
meaſured (accordinge to the rule of Triangles) in two partes, becauſe
there are two triangles in that lande. So by profe ye ſhal finde
in the vpper. i. m. l. one Acre .3. Rodes and .5. Dayworkes: in the other
i. k. l. one Acre. Thus I gather the whole content of that lande to be
2. Acres .3. Roodes, and .5. Dayworkes.
               None otherwyſe of the adioyned. n. o. p. q. and all other fygures folowynge,
and other whatſoeuer they are, that by any meanes may
be brought into triangles.
               Furthermore knowe, that the fygure. i. k. l. m. is redely thus meaſured.
Adde the pearches of bothe the hangynge lynes together: ſo
haue ye. 23. Wyth this number, and wyth halfe the pearches of the
ſyde. i. l. whiche he cutteth ſquyrewyſe, beynge. 20. pearches, enter
your table: ſo is founde as afore.
               Theſe two fygures folowynge may alſo be thus meaſured, otherwiſe
then by the rule of Triangles. Enter your table wyth theyr
conueniente lengthe and breadthe. So ſhall ye fynde the contente of
all ſuche.

               
               
                  
Theſe three fygures folowinge, althoughe they may be meaſured
by the rule of Triangles: yet for quicker ſpede, they haue alſo theyr
proper meaſuringe as enſueth.
               Laye together the two ſydes whiche are parallels of the fyrſt fygure
a. that is .6. and 18. makinge .24. the halfe is .12. the breadthe .5.
Enter with .5. and .12. your table. So haue ye one rode, and fyue dayworkes.
For the other two b, c, and ſuche lyke, ioyne the heades or
endes in one: and enter your table with halfe of thoſe pearches, and
with the whole number of the middle lyne.

               
            
            
               How by ſupputation to meaſure all
Triangled Lande.
               
                  To meaſure triangled lāde bi ſupputatiō
                  IOyne all the ſydes together: take halfe: out of that halfe pulle
euery ſyde, nothing difference. Then multiply the 
                     •
                  ifferences
the one in the other: and the thirde difference augment in the
product. That which encreaſeth multiply in the halfe of all the ſydes
ioyned. Then the Radix of the ſurmontinge ſumme is the content of
that Triangle.
               
                  Foure rules folowing.Nowe reſte foure rules to be treated of. The fyrſte for all maner
regular ſquare Superficies. The ſeconde for Rounde lande, and her
partes. The third for Steples, Columnes, Globes, and theyr parts.
The laſte for Mountaines and Ʋalleyes. Here they ſhall in order
followe.
            
         
         
            
            A rule for all maner regular or right ſquared lande of
many ſydes, as 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 20. 100. &c.
THE IIII. CHAPTER.
            
               To meaſure lande of many ſydes.MEaſure and laye all the ſydes together, taking the halfe number
of Pearches there conteyned. Then drawe a right hanginge
lyne from the centre or myddes of that fygure, to the
middes of ſome one ſyde. And with that lengthe and the other enter
your Table. Note that the Triangle of all ſydes like, and the Quadrate
fygure, are alſo meaſured by this rule.
            
               Enſample.
               
                  S
                  Ʋppoſe this figure. a. b. c. d. to be a ſtreſquare pece of land
and euery ſyde .24. pearches. The halfe ſumme of all ſydes
is .72. pearches: the right hanginge pricked lyne, a. c.
21. Pearches. With theſe two numbers ye muſte enter
your table of accompt folowinge hereafter. And dooe as
is opened in the declaration there adioined, when numbres ſurmoūt
the Table, as they do here.
               So ſhall ye finde, 9. Acres .1. Roode, and. 8. Dayworkes, the contēt
of this fygure. a. b. c. d. Euen thus is the other nyneſquared fygure
meaſured, and all ſuche like.

ſheweth the content of any Circle.
            Or thus more playnelye. Ye ſſhal enter your
Table wyth halfe ye nūber of Pearcches of the whole
Circumference or compaſſe, and wyth the number of
half the Diametre or breadth. So haue ye the cotente.
            
               Enſample.
               SƲppoſe a piece of lande, wherof the compaſſe is 100. pearches, the
breadth 33. Pearches. I woulde knowe howe muche lande is in
this Figure. Enter your Table wyth halfe the compaſſe that
is .50. and wyth halfe the breadth that is .16.

pearches. Becauſe in the table I can not finde
50. for the greateſt Lengthe is .40. (therfore I
enter wyth .40). and .16. So is founde foure Acres.
Then I enter agayne wyth .16. pearches
remaynyng and .16. the breadth as before: that
bryngeth one Acre. Now to conclude, by addicion
of .1. and .4. I finde .5. Acres in that rounde
lande, whoſe halfe compaſſe is .50. pearches. and
the breadthe .16. pearches.
               FOr perfecte knowledge and vſe of this Table folowinge, when
partes of Pearches are adioyned, note wel this other example
that enſueth, & alſo what is ſayd
of the declaration annexed vnto the

Table,How parts of pearches are to be cōpted in meaſuring. when partes of pearches are
in the length, breadth, or in bothe.
               Imagine. f. g. h. to be a rounde pece
of lande: I finde by meaſure the whole
compaſſe .99. Pearches. The halfe
is .49. 2/1. The hangynge Lyne or halfe
breadth is .15. ¾. Enter your table wyth
the whole Pearches, that is .49. and
15. leauinge out .½. and .¾. whyche were

but parts of pearches. So haue ye .4. acres .2. rodes .3. dayworks, & .3.
Pearches. For thoſe parts of pearches omitted at your firſt entring
the table, worke thus. The halfe pearch, quarter, or other parts of a
pearch in the length, muſt be reckened by them ſelues in the whole
breadth: and thoſe of the breadth cōtrariwiſe in the length. If there
be ſuche odde partes in bothe, then recken them of the length in the
whole breadth, and them of the breadth in the whole length: ioining
to the other aforegotten, remembring the product of the one fraction
multiplied in thother, to be pulled from the encreaſe. To make
this matter playne, I wyll take this laſte enſample before. The
one number wherwyth I ſhould haue entred my Table, was .49.½.
the other .15.¾. I founde fyrſte by entringe with .49. and .15. (omitting
the odde parts) 4. acres .2. roodes .3. Dayworks, and .3. pearches. Now
for the encreaſe of ye partes of pearches left out: I muſt (as I ſaid) reken
them of ye length in the breadth, & contrariwiſe thē of ye breadth
in the length. Half .15.¾. is .7. pearches & .7/8. Thre quarters of .49.½. is
.37. Pearches .⅛. Which added, makes .45. pearches: This adioyned to
the number aforegotten, bryngeth the whole content of the rounde
fygure, which is .4. Acres .3. Roodes .4. Dayworkes .3. Pearches .&.5/1.
of a pearch, the product of the one fraction multiplied in thother ſubducted.
What muſt be done whē ye nūbres wherwith ye ſhold enter
excede your table, coūſel ye declaration of your table there adioyned.
            
            
               Of the halfe Circle.
               
                  
               
               
                  To meaſure halfe circled lande.FOr this half Circle, enter ye table with

halfe his compaſſe, & with halfe the Diametre
of the circle, or with the lēgth of
ye pricked hanginge lyne, k. l. So the content
of this half circle, is .2. acres .1. roode
.7. dayworkes .1. Pearch, & .13/16. of a pearche.
            
            
               An other enſample of porcions and partes of a Circle.
               SƲppoſe .n. m. o. folowing were a part of a Circle, or pece of land,
whoſe content ye deſired. The whole compaſſe of the Circle
whiche this porcion repreſenteth, is (as afore) .99. Pearches: his
Diametre or breadth .31.½. The pricked arcke or compaſſe n. m. o. is
.74. Now with the half breadth or ſemidiametre of the circle .15.¾. &
with .37. the halfe of the pricked compaſſe: enter your table. So haue
ye .3. Acres .2. Roodes, 5. Dayeworkes, 2. Pearches, and .¾. of a

Pearche, the contente of the piece of Lande full of Pryckes, to the
ſydes of the Triangle pricked.To meaſure partes of circled lande.
               
               If ye deſire to knowe the ſumme of

pearches in thother porcion beneth the
Triangle, ſeperated by the lyne, m. o: ye
muſte adde the contente of the triangle
(whiche is .3. Roodes, and .¾. of a pearch,
founde by the rule of Triangles) to the
Acres & pearches before ſearched. So
haue ye .4. Acres .1. roode .5. Dayworkes
3. pearches, and .½. of a pearche. This ſubtracted
or pulled from the number conteyned
in the whole Circle, the remayne is the pearches included in
the ſmal pece beneath the Triangle. That is .1. Roode .36. pearches,
and .1/8. of a pearche.
            
            
               Howe mixed fygures are meaſured.
               
                  Lande compounde of circles or his partes.
                  I Thinke none nowe will doubt how theſe two fygures
folowinge are meaſured, becauſe they are made of porcions
or partes of Circles, whoſe meaſure is before ſufficiently
opened: the one conſiſtinge of two halfe circles
and a Quadrangle: the other beinge the porcion of the
Circle, m. o. doubled.

               
               If any euyll faſhioned lande chaunce to be meaſure, whiche requireth
to be brought in many triangles, to ſaue labour, ye may adde
ſome porcion vnto that, and make it ſquare or otherwyſe. So let it
then be meaſured: and after frō the product pul away that ye added:
the remayne is the content.
            
            
               
               To fynde the content ſuperficiall, of Steples, Columnes,
Globes, and theyr partes.
               TO the Arithmetician I ſay. For picked Steples, multiplye the
whole ſyde in halfe the Circumference of the baſe,To meaſure Steples, Columnes, Globes. &c. addynge the
playne of that baſe. For Pillers augmente the Circumference
of the baſe in the height, puttinge to the playne of both Baſes. For
Globes, the Diametre in the Circumference multiplied: euen ſo of
Fragmentes or Partes. Let them that be voyde of Arithmetike,
enter my Table of accompte folowinge, with ſuche numbers as I
now wylled the Arithmetician to multiplye, not forgetinge what I
haue before written: So I ſerue theyr turne.
            
            
               Or thus, by the rule of proportion, the partes of a Globe
are founde.
               
                  
               
               
                  To meaſure parts of Globes.Suppoſe.a. b. c. to be a piece of a

Globe, and .4. to be a Porcion of the
diametre, the whole being .14. Thus
I ſaye .14. The whole Diametre geueth
.616. the contente ſuperficiall of
this Circle: what ſhall .4. bringe: So haue ye .176. whiche is the content
of that pece.
            
            
               To fynde the Diametre by ſome knowen portion
therof.
               
                  To fynde the unknowen Diametre of a Globe.IF ye be ignorant what lengthe the Diametre of that Globe is
whoſe porcion ye haue: the height or parte of the Dimetient being
.4. foote, augment halfe the lyne. a. b, whiche is .6.⅓. in hym
ſelfe, and the product diuide by .4. So haue ye .10. to be added to .4.
whiche maketh .14. the whole Diametre.
            
         
         
            The true meaſuringe of Mountaynes and valleyes.
THE VI. CHAPTER.
            
               To meaſure Mountaynes.FIrſt ye ſhall meaſure the circuite of the fote, or baſe of ye Mountaine:
then the compaſſe of the ſummitie or toppe: adding them
together. So ſhall ye do of the Aſcenſes, that is, the goinge vp
from the foote to the toppe: ioyninge the meaſure of the longer and
ſhorter in one. Nowe take the halfe of the circuites added, and the
halfe parte of the Aſcenſes ioyned and enter your Table. There ſhal
ye ſe the content.
            
               
               Enſample.
               A B. C. is the Mountayne: a. c. the circuite of the baſe, beinge
100. Pearches: b. the toppe .16. Pearches. Whiche ioyned together
make .116. F. c.

the one aſcenſe,Figure of a Mountayne. is .55. Pearches:
the other .75. Theſe added
make .130. The halfe of
the circuites, is .58. the halfe
of the Aſcenſes .65. Wyth
theſe two Summes ye ſhall
enter your table of accompt:
where ye ſhall finde .23, acres
2. rodes, and .10. pearches, the true content of this figured hill.
            
            
               Of the Valley.
               
                  To meaſure Valleyes.
                  AS in the Mountayne ye meaſured the circuite or compaſſe
of the baſe or foote: ſo here contrary, ye ſhall
meete rounde about the circuite, or compaſſe of the
height of the Ʋalley. And as ye gott the meaſure, or
compaſſe of the toppe of the Mountayne: ſo meaſure
the circuite of the deapth of ye 
                  Ʋalley. In like maner
as ye meaſured the aſcenſe, that is, the goynge vp from the foote to
the toppe: ſo meaſure the deſcenſe, or goynge downe of the Hyll to
the depth of the Ʋalley. The reſt all worke, as I haue ſhewed in
meaſuringe the mountayne.
               
                  Figure of a Valley.
                  For more playnneſſe,

beholde this enſāple, or
figur. If ye lay together
the circuits of ye height
and depth, whiche is .210
and .30. taking the halfe
parte of thoſe two circuites,
making an .120. thā
the two aſcenſes .140. &. 60, added in one produce .200. the halfe therof
beinge .100, with this, and .120. the other halfe of the circuite, ye
may enter your table. That doynge, loe .75. Acres.
            
            
               
               Howe this table of accompte now folowynge is to be vſed
               
                  WHen you haue gotten a conuenient Length & Breadth,
(as I haue aboue declared, by dyuers triangles & other
figures) then you ſhal enter this table. Seke there the
length and moſt number of Perches in the higher margyne,
which beginneth at .1. and endeth rightwarde at
40. Loke thother ſumme of Perches (I meane the Breadth) in the
right ſide, & hanging margine, from .1. deſcendinge to .30. Nowe at
the meting of the lines, where the one anſwereth the other directly
in a ſquare, you ſhal finde the Acres, Roodes, Dayworkes & perches.
Note that the fyrſte number ſet on the left ſide & vpper parte in any
ſquare, ſignifieth the number of Acres. The fygure .1. ſet in the vpper
part & right ſide, dothe betoken a Rode: the fygure .2. there two
Rodes .3. thre Rodes. Any figure in the left ſide beneth, ſygnifyeth a
Dayeworke, or dayeworkes. A fygure in the lower parte ryghtewarde,
declareth Perches.
            
            
               A declaracion adioyned.
               
                  what is to be done when nū
                     bers (with whiche you shulde enter) excede your Table.
                  V
                  ƲHen it chaūſeth that the one number or both with the
which ye ſhould enter this table, are greatter then any
here founde: it behoueth you to take the halfe of thone
and the hole of the other, or what partes ye liſt of bothe
moſte commodiouſe for your purpoſe, and ſo enter your
table. Loke then what is there founde, and it ſhal beare his name of
the partes multiplied in them ſelues.
               Enſample. Suppoſe the number with the which ye ſhould enter
your table to be .103. pearches in Lengthe, and the Breadth .60.
neither of theſe maye be founde in the margynes: wherfore I take
the thirde parte of an .103. which is .34. Pearches and .1. remayneth.
The halfe of .60. that is .30. I fynde with entryng them at the commune
metinge .6. Acres .1. Rode, & .5. Dayworkes. Loke what I haue shewed in the .5. chapter of partes, that underſtande here of hole perches leſt: ſubtractinge. &c.This ſumme muſt
haue his name of the partes augmented in them ſelues. I toke the
thirde part of the one, and halfe the other number, therfore .2, muſt
be multiplyed in .3. or contrary, ſo haue ye, 6. which ſignifieth that ye
haue found by entring, but the ſixt part of that number ye ſhuld find
Wherfore I muſt make this ſumme tofore founde (being .6. Acres
.1. Rode, and .5. dayworkes) ſixetimes as much. So haue ye .38. acres
& 1. Rode. For the Pearche remayning in the Length, recken him in
the breadth, (as is afore declared) in the .5. cha. of the remaynes: ſo
haue ye .60. Perches more to be added. So the encreaſe of theſe two
numbres .103. and .60. amounteth to .38. Acres, 2. Rodes, & .5. dayeworkes.
Thus any maner Length and Breadthe, is reduced to this
Table folowyng, which ſuffiſeth.

THus with fewe woordes is ended the certayne meaſurynge of
all maner Lande, towchynge theyr ſuperficiall contentes.
Wherfore nowe ſhall folowe the trewe meaſuring of tymbre,
Stone, Steples, Pyllers, Globes, accordyng
to theyr Craſſitude.
         
         
            
            To the Reader.
            
               
                  IT cometh communely to paſse that Carpenters,
Maſons, and ſuch like Artificers are
put eyther to meaſure Timber euery waye
ſquare, or ſquared logs, broader on thone, thī
on thother ſyde, yea many tymes mutilate or
vnperfecte ſtuffe: ſome tymes. 3. 5. 10. or, 20,
ſquare in the heade and ſo throughe, oftentymes
rounde ſtone or tymber, with hollowed.
&c. Afore I ſhewe vnto them what muſte be
done with ſuche peces of Tymber or ſtone to gette theyr true meaſure,
my deſire ſhall be, that ſuche Crafteſmen will leaue to be heady
or ſelf willed, yea ſo gredily to ſticke to theyr olde corrupted rules
that vtterly they refuſe to be taught.
            Both learninge & experience declareth vnto me, that ye groundes
whiche the beſt of them haue are falſe. To open howe and where, it
nedeth not: neyther doeth it apperteine to inſtruction. Only it maye
ſuffice hym that liketh the true way, here to receyue it appointed to
him. Yet to ſatiſfie and content him whiche wil not beleue any ſuch
errours or falſe groundes to be: I ſay (and truelye) that the Ruler of
tymber meaſure, which the more parte of them hath, is not made by
right arte. Beſydes that theyr craft in ſeekinge the ſquare of ſome
tymber, is very falſe. They vſe in meaſuring to lay the broader and
narrower ſydes together in a ſumme: and to take the halfe of that
number for the ſquare. Then they ſeke this vntrue ſquare vpon the
falſe ruler: and ſo meaſuringe the tymber, they conclude of it vntruly.
As this is corrupted, ſo are other groundes which they take to be
infallible. Now to the purpoſe, touchinge the correction of thoſe errours
with other not mencioned, wherby true meaſuringe may enſue
this way ſhall be taken. After I haue opened how ye muſt handle
all ſuch faſhioned tymber (as afore is ſpoken of) there ſhall folowe
a table, in whiche ye may fynde (as I will declare) the ſquare of any
ſtone, or tymber. That knowen, it is requiſite to haue an other table
immediatly folowinge, whiche may appoint to all true ſquares,
from. 1. to. 6. inches, the iuſt lengthe to make a Foote euery waye
ſquare.In a foote ſquare is conteined 1728. Inches. With that length agreable to your ſquare, your logge muſt
be meaſured. And as oft as ye finde it from the one ende to thother
of your tymber, ſo oft ye may conclude the foote ſquare to be conteyned

in that tymber logge, or ſtone: that is, ſo many ſquare ſete there
to be included. This Table of tymber meaſure ſtandeth in the place
of a good Ruler, well docked with true meaſures. By this ye maye
make or correct rulers at pleaſure, as after appeareth.
Nowe orderly foloweth the true meaſuringe of all
faſhioned Tymber or Stone
afore named.
         
         
            Howe tymber or ſtone, foure ſquare euery way, or broader on
the one then on the other ſyde, is meaſured.
THE VII. CHAPTER.
            
               IF a pece of Timber, or Stone be ether equally
ſquare, or broader on the one ſyde then on
the other, ye ſhall take the iuſte meaſure, I
meane howe many Inches the broader ſyde
conteyneth: euen ſo of ye narrower. This done
ye muſt ſeke in the table of ſquares folowing,
the meaſure of the broader ſyde of the tymber
or ſtone, in the vpper margyne of that table.
Then looke for the number of Inches of the
equall or narrower ſyde, in the right part & hanginge margyne. At
the commune metinge, where the one number anſwereth directlye
to the other, there your true ſquare ſhall appeare. This ſquare ſo
founde ſhall be referred to your table of tymber meaſure: in ye which
ye may playnely ſee (yf you runne downe by the left margine, vntyll
your Inches ſquare appeare) howe many fete or Inches of your ruler
belongeth to a foote ſquare. As oftē as that meaſure there founde
is conteyned in the tymber or ſtone, ſo often and as many fete ſquare
ye may conclude (without doubt) that pece of timber or ſtone to haue.
            
               Enſample.
               
                  S
                  Ʋppoſe this ſquared Tymber or Stone, a. b. c. d. were
to be meaſured, the broader ſyde, a. b, 20. Inches: the narrower
ſyde. b. c. 13. ynches: the lengthe. 40. ynches. Nowe
I muſte ſeke the broader ſyde. 20. in the vpper margyne

of the table. The narrower ſyde. 13. muſt be

founde in the right ſyde and hanginge margine.
At theyr cōmon metyng :16: inches, and
.⅛. part of an Inche ſhall appeare. This true
ſquare muſte be ſearched for in the Table of
tymber meaſure. Therfore loke for. 16. in the
margine of that Table. In the ſquares with
him rightwarde, ye ſhal ſynde. 6. Inches, and
.¾. which is thre quarters of an inche. Somedele
leſſe of your ruler then .6 and .¼. layed
out vpon the Tymber, maketh a fote ſquare.
And that meaſure ſo diſcretely handeled, is
conteined in the lengthe of your tymber ſixetymes. Wherefore affirme
ſixe fote there to be, beſyde that is left .1/54. parte of a foote. Note
becauſe the ſquares, at al tymes (as in this enſample) ryſe not to euen
Inches, but ſometyme to odde partes: Therfore accordinge to your
diſcrecion, adde or take away ſome part more or leſſe in ſetting forth
the fote ſquare, as aboue is parformed.
               It were intollerable tediouſnes, yea impoſſible, to ſette forth ye true
quantities of tymber meaſure, to allodde quantities of ſquares. The
diſcrete handlinge of theſe, the wyttie ſhall bringe to a ſufficient exactneſſe.
            
         
         
            Of Tymber or Stone. 3. 5. 10. 20. or moſides
ſquare. &c.
THE VIII. CHAPTER.
            
               WHen Tymber hathe diuerſe equall ſquares in the heade
and ſo through: fyrſt meaſure all the ſquare ſydes round
about the heade or ende of the Timber. Then take halfe
the number of the whole meaſure for thone Breadthe.
Then meaſure from the Centre (which is the middle of
the heade, or ende of the Tymber) to the myddes of one ſquare ſyde,
betwene the two angles: and take the meaſure of that diſtance for
the other Breadth. Nowe reſorte wyth the meaſures of theſe two
breadthes (as tofore) to the Table of ſquares: ſeking the bigger number
or breadth in the vpper margyne, and the other leſſe in the ſyde

margine. With the ſquare there founde, haue recourſe to the table
of tymber meaſure: and do as I haue inſtructed.
            
               Enſample.
               
                  ADmit this ſmal pece of tymber .5. ſquare. e.

f. .g. h. ſhoulde be meaſured, euery ſyde being
.12. Inches. If ye adde together in one
ſumme all ye .5. ſydes, they make .60. Inches. The
halfe is. 30. that ſerueth for one Breadth. Then
the line .e. f. which goeth from the Centre or middes
of the ſquare to the middle of one ſyde, is .8.
Inches. The two numbers .30. and .8. muſte be
ſought (as afore) in the table of ſquares folowing.
At the commune metinge, your ſquare ſhall appeare
.15. Inches and .½. This ſquare .15. ſeke in the
table of tymber meaſure. There ye may ſe right
with it .7. Inches, and .⅔. Nowe becauſe of .½. the
odde quantitie of the ſquare aboue .15. Inches, lay
ſometyme leſſe. Then ſe howe oftentymes that
meaſure (ſo with diſcretion handled) is from the
one ende of your tymber to the other: and affirme ſo many tymes a
foote ſquare there to be, as that meaſure is founde in the lengthe of
your logge.
            
         
         
            Howe rounde and hollowed Tymber, Steples, Pillers,
Globes .&c. are to be meaſured.
THE IX. CHAPTER.
            
               FIrſt gyrde the logge rounde about with ſome lyne:
then diuide the lyne, whiche compaſſed that tymber,
in two equal partes, kepe the one part for the bygger
Breadthe: After ye ſhall diuide againe that whole
length (the twenty and two parte caſt away) in thre
partes, and take the halfe of one of them for the other narrower
Breadth. With the meaſures of theſe two breadthes, haſte to your
table, performing all thing as afore is opened.
            
               
               Enſample.
               
                  SƲppoſe this little piece of Tymber .i. k. l. 
m. were to be meaſured, the compaſſe or
gyrdinge 36. ynches, the halfe of that is,
18. beinge the one breadth: then the thyrde parte
of .36. is .12. the halfe of it is .6. whiche is the other
narrower breadth. With theſe two numbers .6.
and .18. enter the Table of ſquares folowinge, and
ſo the Table of Tymber meaſure. At the laſte
(all thinges performed as before) ye ſhall fynde in
this rounde logge, (the lengthe. l. m. being. 18. ynches).
1. foote and .⅛. parte of a foote. This is ſufficient
for all ſuche lyke.
            
            
               A note of hollowed Tymber.
               IF it chaunce that hollowed Tymber be to be meaſured: meaſure
the whole logge as though it were not hollowe, as aboue
is declareth. Then meaſure the narrower and broader ſyde of
the hollowe: and ſee what is conteyned in that, as though it were
maſſy Tymber. Nowe pulle out the content of it, from the whole
aboue meaſured: the remayne of force muſte ſhewe what tymber is
included in that hollowed body.
               I Am vnable in few woordes to expreſſe to the vnlearned, by what
meane Pyramidal, or picked regular Steples of all faſhions are
meaſured. Alſo how Pyllers: how the content of Globes or Bowles
are ſearched: vnleſſe the arte of numbringe were taſted. That
beinge knowen: thus (as nowe foloweth) I teache.
            
            
               Howe the Craſsitude of picked Steples
is knowen.
               MƲltiply the playne of the Baſe in the third part of ye height:
ſo ye haue the Craſſitude. Or multiply the content ſuperficiall
(founde as I haue inſtructed) in the height of the Steple,

takinge for your purpoſe the thyrde parte of that product.
            
            
               Howe the content of Pillers is knowen.
               Increaſe the baſe playne in his altitude or height: ſo haue ye your
deſyre.
            
            
               Howe the Cubicall bodyes of Globes are
ſearched.
               THe content ſuperfycial founde (as I haue opened) muſt be multiplyed
in the ſyxte parte of the Diametre: the product is that ye
requyre. Or the thyrde parte of the Superficiall contente in
half the Diametre. Or multiple the plaine of the Circle in the whole
Diametre: then take two thyrde partes, which added make the craſſitude.
            
            
               Of the halfe Circle.
               HIs ſuperficial content multiplied (as is ſayd) bringeth the magnitude
of him. If any man require enſāples of this laſte matters,
or more ſufficient handlynge: let them reſorte vnto my
bokes publiſhed of Geometrye, there they ſhall be ſatyſfyed. Theſe
little apperteyn to Carpenters or Maſons, therfore not by enſample
declared.
            
            
               A generall Note.
               
                  WHen thou ſhalt be put to meaſure ſome body without
order or faſhion, lackinge part of his ſquare, or hauing
more then his forme: if it lacke thou ſhall make it perfect
by obſeruing diligentlye the runninge together of
the ſydes. The partes wantinge ſhall be meaſured as
though they were there, whiche porcions muſte be taken
from the whole body meaſured.
               Alſo when there reſulteth any more then the form or regulare
ſquare: fyrſte meaſure the ſquare body: then the craſſitude whyche
aboundeth. All put together do ſhewe the whole irregular bodye.
This ſuffyſeth.
            
            
               
               A table to finde the iuſt Radix or Square of any Tymber,
or Stone.
               
                  IT behoueth you to knowe that this Table
folowinge is made for the true ſquare of any
maner Timber. Therfore vnderſtande that
the numbers from .1. to .40. ſet aboue in the
hyghe Margyne betoken the Inches of the
broader ſide of the timber. And the numbers
from .1. and ſo downeward to .30. put in the
right part and hanging margine of this Table,
ſignifie the ynches of the narrower ſide:
and to conclude briefly, the elementes or figures ſet in euery ſquare
roume betoken the iuſte ſquare. The bygger ſigures leftwarde in
euery ſquare place, ſignifie the whole ynches. And the other leſſer
ryghtewarde in the ſame ſquare diuided by a lyne, the partes of ynches,
as ½ ⅖ &c.
               This firſte fraction toward the lefte hande betokeneth one halfe
parte of an ynche: thother two fyftes of an ynche: and euery fygure
or fraction, hauinge a pointe adioyned vnto him, ſomdeale leſſe then
the parte is: as this parte ½ repreſenteth ſcante halfe an ynche, a very
little quantitie leſſe. And if he had two pryckes by him, he ſhould
haue declared ſome quantitie more: as this other fraction or parte
:⅖ whiche is more than two fiftes, a ſmale deale.
               It had not bene nedefull to haue put the partes of the ſquare ſo
preciſely as they are here: neyther is it requiſite ſo
curiouſly to take them.

THE, X. CHAPTER.
            
               
               THis Table (as ye ſee) is deuyded

into twoo columes or
rowes: the one very ſhorte,
the other longer.
            In the headde of the Fyrſte
I haue put this woord Fote
in the Seconde rowe Inches
and partes: to ſignifie feete,
inches, and partes of inches.
The ſummes in the margyne and lefte parte of the
fyrſte and ſeconde colume, declare the quantitie of
the ſquare of timber or ſtone, from .1. to 36. inches
ſquare. Within the rowes you maye fynde the iuſt
lengthe to a foote ſquare, if ye enter into them in
ryght order, accordynge to the ſquare
            
               Enſample.
               SƲppoſe the ſquare of your tymber were .7. ynches,
and that ye deſyred to know what meſure
or length of the ruler wolde make a foote ſquare.
Seke in the leſte margyne .7. ynches: and with him
in that order towarde the righte hande, ye ſhal find
2. foote. 11. ynches, & 2/7 of an ynche. Note becauſe the
fractiō 2/7. hath a prycke by hym, it betokeneth ſome
ſmall quantitie leſſe then 2/7 of an ynche. If it hadde
twoo pryckes or poyntes thus: 2/7 it ſhoulde ſignyfie
ſome lyttel quantitie more. Neither maketh it matter,
whether ye obſerue this prickynge or noo, the
quantitie is ſo lyttel to be added or pulled awaye.
               Note what hathe ben ſpoken of Tymber, the
ſame alſo is to be vnderſtande of ſtone, lyke wyſe to
be meaſured.
            
            
               ¶Thus is finyſhed the meaſuryng of timber,
nowe enſueth of Bourde. &c.
            
         
         
            
            Howe Tables, Bordes, Glaſse, or any ſuch like are meaſured,
accordinge to theyr length and breadth onely
to the foote ſquare.
THE XI. CHAPTER.
            
               THis thing is performed by ye helpe of a large table
folowing, diuided in ſixe ſmal tables, and as
many margines The fyrſt and left marigne be
ginneth at .¼. whiche is one quarter of an ynch,
and extendeth to .6. Inches, as ye may playnely
perceyue yf ye runne downe by that margyne.
This hath his Table on the ryghte ſyde adioyninge
vnto him. The other taketh his begynninge
at .6. ynches .¼. and endeth at .12. hauyng his proper table alſo.
The thyrde, from .12 ¼ to .18. And ſo from .18 ¼. to .24. From .24 ¼. to .30
The laſte margine is from .30. 1/4 to .36, and there endeth.
            Of this that is ſayd, you may gather that euery margine hath his
Table on his ryght ſyde. Alſo you muſte knowe that in the top and
beneth I haue put (as in the table of Tymber meaſure) theſe words,
fote, ynche, and partes, to ſygnify fete, ynches, and partes of an ynch.
Whenſoeuer ye lyſte to meaſure, Borde, Glaſſe, or any other ſuche,
with the breadth of it enter this Table: and ſeeke that breadth in his
proper margine. There ye ſhall fynde in right order how many fete,
ynches, or partes, of an Inche belonge to a foote ſquare. So often as
the meaſure is in your ſtuffe, iuſt as many fete haue ye in that borde
or ſuche lyke. If the breadth excede this Table: than diuide ye breadth
in partes and worke as is and ſhall be declared. So the ingenious
applyeth this Table for all maner breadthes moſte exactly.
            
               Enſample.
               SƲypoſe I haue a pane of Glaſſe, or a borde, whoſe breadthe were
22. ynches .¼. the length .16. fote. In the fourth margin I finde this
breadthe .22. and .¼. And euen with it in the Table rightward I ſe
.6. ynches .⅓. So much of my ruler (wanting ſome ſmall quantity) maketh
a foote. Nowe, becauſe in the lengthe of my borde (whiche is 16.
foote) that meaſure is founde .29. tymes, and .⅔. partes. I concluded .29.
foote ther to be, & two thyrde partes of a foote ſquare, accordinge to

THE XII. CHAPTER.
            
               
BEcauſe the effect of this Ruler
is aboue declared by Tables,
an Inſtrument alſo wel
knowen and commune amonge
good Artifycers: I will not ſpende
many woordes, in opening it. Beholde
the fygures, and learne by
them howe ye ought to make, and
commonly to decke youre Ruler,
bothe with Tymber and bourde
meaſure.
            
               Enſample.
               ADmit the ruler to be. a. b. c.
d. wel playned, twelue Inches
longe, a quarter of an
Inche thicke, and two Inches yn breadth.
Truly yt were more commodious,
if it hath two foote in
length. This ruler here imagined
but a fote in length, is diuided fyrſt
in twelue euen partes, called Inchess:
then euery Inche in halfe, or
two equall porciōs: ech half in two
quarters: euery quarter in four or
two partes at the leſt: as in this en
ſample. Then are the fygures placed
from. 1. to. 12. manifeſtinge the
ynches. Thus your Ruler is ready
to receaue the meaſures which are
marked or fygured on your Ruler
thus. And fyrſt the Tymber meaſure
as foloweth.
               
                  
                  YE ſhall reſorte to youre Table of Tymber meaſure,
and ſeeke howe many fete belonge to. 1. Inche ſquare:
there ye ſhall fynde. 144. This number note write, or
rather graue, where this fygure. 1. repreſentinge one
inche, is fygured: as pe may ſe in the middes betwene
the lyne. e. f. and the line of the fygure. g. h. This done.
reſorte to your Table agayne, and beholde howe many fote and partes.
2. Inches ſquare requireth. So ſhall ye fynde. 36. foote, whiche is
placed in the next roume leftwarde, vnder the charactere. 2. ſygnifying
two ynches. Thus of the reſte, fete, Inches, and partes, founde
in youre Table, vntyll you come to the. 12. Inche, where ye ſhall perceyue.
12. Inches onely to be ſet in his proper roume. &c. Then ſeeke
further in your Table, what belongeth to. 13. Inches: Lo. 10. ynches
and. 1/5. This muſte be numbred in the lyne. c. a. from c which lyne betokeneth
the thicknes of the Ruler. Make there a little ſtryke vpon
that groſnes, euen or ryght agaynſt the meaſure. 10. 1/5. what nede
many woordes. Thus do vntyll ye come to. 36. Inches, and
and that is noted (as the Table of Tymber meaſure ſheweth
(right with. 1. ynche, and .3/3. from c. No otherwyſe
is perfourmed of borde meaſure, as ye

               Ʋppoſe a pece of Tymber to be moaten, whoſe true
ſquare is.The .8. Chapter ſheweth how the true ſquare is foūd 7. inches: this ſquare appointeth you to the
fygure of. 7. in the lyne. g. h. vnder whom rightwarde
in the place aſſigned to Tymber meaſure, is written
2. foote. 11. ynches, and. 2/7. As often as that meaſure ys
founde in the length of youre Tymber, ſo many foote
of Tymber is in that pece.
            
               An other Enſample.
               IMagyne your ſquare to be. 22. ynches: ſeeke in the lyne. a. c. Note
then howe muche of your Ruler is left from that, to the ende of
your Rule. c. and ſo much belongeth to a foote. Therefore laye out
that meaſure vpon your Tymbre, and recken howe many tymes
ye maye fynde it, from the one to the other of youre logge: for ſo many
foote of Tymber is there. Euen thus of Borde. Seke the breadth
vpon your Ruler, in the roume or place of borde meaſure, and immediatly
before your eyes there remayneth what is to be layed out to
make a iuſte foote of borde.

THE XV. CHAPTER.
            IT behoueth you to loke thorow your ſightes. q. r. placed
in the thicknes or lyne. k. m. a fyne threde and plummet
fallinge at libertie out of the centre. n. If this plummet
and threde chaunce preciſely on the lyne of Leauel (whiche
is. n. o.) whatſoeuer ye ſe thorow the ſyghtes, is leauell
with your eye: yf otherwyſe, the thinge that ye looke vnto is not
leuell, eyther more or leſſe then the height or leuel of your eye: More
yf the plummet fall to youwarde: Leſſe, if contrary.
         
         
            
            Howe by the lyne of Leuell to forſee whether the water of
any ſpringe or head is poſsible to be brought to a place
apointed, and alſo to iudge the holeſomnes
of it.
THE XVI. CHAPTER.
            
               YE ſhall go to the head or ſpring, and ſet your Ruler to
your eye (being in height equall with the water) ſo ye
the fyne corde and plummet fal preciſely on the line of
Leauell. Nowe yf thorow the ſyghtes, ye may ſe aboue
the place, knowe and iudge the water poſſible to
be brought, yf your ſyght fall vnder, impoſſible. It cometh
communely to paſſe when the place to the whiche ye woulde
haue water conueyed, is of any great diſtaunce from the heade, then
hylles, valleyes, and ſuche lyke impedimentes lette the lyne vyſuall
to haue his free courſe: wherefore this remedy is prouided. At the
heade of the ſpringe, ye ſhall loke thorow the ſyghtes (as before) and
note a marke in the next hyll towarde the place, then go to ye marke:
in lyke maner obſerue there an other in ſome hyll: ſo forthe vntyl by
any of them ye may perceyue the place deſyred. If then your ſyght
running through the pinnes of your ruler, (the threde euer fallinge
on the lyne. n. o.) excede that place, the cōueinge of your water is poſſible
otherwiſe not. Nowe by the waye brieflie ye ſhall be enſtructed
howe ye maye knowe the holeſomnes of water.
            TAke a cleane pot and put water in it:How good water is knowen. ſo ſet it on the fyre: after a
little boiling, poure it owte: if thē no filthie remaine in the bottome
of the potte, it maye be iudged the houlſomer. Or thus.
Let fall droppes vpon metel, or rather on glaſſe (any of them beinge
poliſhed) and ſuffer that to drye by it ſelfe: if after there remayne no
ſpot or ſygne, it is a good token. Moreouer, if your water be ſwete,
pure, clere, light, or of littel weight, it followeth ye water to be holeſome
for the vſe of man.
            
               
               Of the line of Heigt.
               
                  WHen ſo euer the threde and plommet do chaūce iuſtly on
the heigt which is n, p: the altitude or height that ye ſee
is euen with the diſtāce from the Middle of your fote to
ye nether parte directly vnder the toppe equal with your
ſtandinge, addinge the heigt of your eye downewarde,
Know that ye muſt euer ſtande vpright with body and necke, your
fete iuſte to gether, the one eye cloſed. &c.
            
            
               The line of vpright Altitudes.
               IƲdge alſo any thing plumbe vpright when the thickenes of your
Ruler. i. l. is cloſely theron, the plummet then at libertie, fallynge
on. q. n, named the line of Heightes vpright. Nowe foloweth the
vſe of the Scale.
            
         
         
            To ſearche out heightes by the Scale, with the ayde
of two places.
THE XVIII. CHAPTER.
            
               LEt the threade and plummet fal in the one, on the .12.
poyntes: in thother ſtacion, on the .6. of the right ſhadowe:
double the diſtāce betwene the two places, the
ſummitie appeareth from that part of ye thing meaſured,
which is equall in hight with your eye. Or the
one in the .12, the other in .8. of right ſhadow: then tryple
the diſtāce. The one in the .12. the other in .6. of right, quaduplate
the ſpace. The one in the .12. the other in .6. of the contrary ſhadowe,
then the ſpace betwene bothe ye ſtacions is equall with that ye meaſure,
euer vnderſtandinge from your eye vpwarde. Euen that ſame
cometh to paſſe, if in the one the threde be founde vpon the .6. of the
contrary, in the other one the .4. of the ſame. or the .4. and .3. of the cō
               trary:
In all thes the Spaces are equall with the altitudes. So then
in meaſurynge the diſtaunce betwene the two places, ye haue the
heyght, from your eye vpwarde, puttyng to it the length from your
ſyght downewarde, the whole Altitude appeareth: the baſe beynge
equall wyth your ſtandinge.
            
               
I Woulde not haue you ignorant here howe to knowe lengthes
which be in height not eaſy to come vnto. Fyrſte (as before) get
the height of the toppe, the altitude of the baſe or longeſt parte
of your lengthe. Subduct the leſſe heighte out of the more, of force
your deſyred lengthe remayneth.How lenghts in height are knowen. Or thus: Let the plummet and
threde fall in the .12. marke your place: go in towarde the thinge (the
threde as it was) vntyll ye ſee the baſe of that lengthe: the diſtaunce
betwene the two ſtandinges, is vndoubtedly the lengthe.
         
         
            Howe with the Scale, director vpright heightes, by theyr
ſhadowes are declared.
THE XIX. CHAPTER.
            TƲrne your leftſyde vnto the Sunne, ſufferinge his beames to
pearce both your ſyghtes. q. r. placed as afore is ſayed in the
thycknes or lyne. k. l. The threde or plummet then hangynge
at lybertye out of the Centre. n. ſheweth aſwel the degrees of height
to be compted from. o. as the partes of the Scale cut. If your threde
be founde in the .12. parte, or lyne of leauell, ſhadowes of all thinges
being perpendiculer eleuated, are equall with theyr bodyes. If the
plummet with the threde be perceyued cuttinge the partes nexte to
the ſyghtes whiche I name pointes of the right ſhadowe, then euery
thinge direct is more then his ſhadowe, by that proporcion which .12.
exceadeth the parts, where the threde was founde. If yt fall in .1. that
is the fyrſte parte of the ryght ſhadowe, take the ſhadowe twelue
tymes to make the height. In two: that is the ſeconde parte. Sixe tymes.
In the thyrde, foure tymes. In the fourth, thre tymes. In the
fyfte, twyſe: and .⅖. of the ſhadowe. In the ſyxte, twyſe In the ſeuenth
once, and .5/7. In the eyght once: and .½. In the nynthe once, and .⅓. In
the tenthe once, and .⅕. In the eleuenth ye ſhal take the ſhadow once,
and 1/11. parte of it.
            
               Right ſhadow.If the arte of numbring were had, I woulde will you to multiply
the lengthe of the ſhadowe by .12. and the product diuide by the parts,
in the whiche ye founde the threde.
            But and yf yt be in the partes of the contrary ſhadowe, augment

the lengthe of the ſhadowe wyth the partes declared by the plummet:
and the encreaſe diuide by .12. ſo commeth the altitude alſo.
            
               Contrary ſhadowe.Thus the compoſition and whole appliance of the Carpenters
ruler is ſhewed: therfore ſomewhat ſhal be now ſayde of the ſquire.
            I am not ignorant that the cōmune vſe of him is better knowen
than I can wyth many wordes expreſſe, wherfore I leaue to write
in that behalfe. Notwithſtandynge I wyll declare how Heightes,
& Lenghtes are taken. &c. matters rare, and knowen of few Artificers.
Alſo by tables to get a true knowledge of the daye houre, and
that diuers wayes, wyth the helpe of the ſquyre: as is opened in my
generall Prognoſtication augmented in the yere of our Lord. 1556.
         
         
            Vvhat length the ſides of thy Squyre ought to be, and
the diuiſion of him.
THE XX. CHAPTER.
            
               I Nede not to put forthe the exacte
making of this Inſtrument ſo wel

knowen. Loe therfore thefygure.
One ſide ſuppoſed two fote from the
inwarde angle: and the other a iuſte
fote from the ſame. The longer. a b.
inwardly diuided from the angle▪ a.

and euery of them into a leſſe (if
ye lyſt) ech conteynyng .10. minutes.
Alſo the ſide. c. d. in the outward contrary
plain from the toppe. c. vnto. d
is diuided into .12. euen porcions: and
again (if ye require exactnes) euery of
thē into .6. eche of value .10. minutes.
Behold a line & plūmet falling from
e. to f. a parallel to cd, and a. b. Thus
this ſquire is well framed for the vſe
of diuers tables put forthe in my general
prognoſtication, & alſo for ye findyng
of Altitudes and Longitudes, which here I purpoſe now brieflye
to open.
            
               
               Howe by this Squire heightes are knowen.
               ALtitudes or heghtes are founde, the line or plūmet centred in
the .6. poynte, cuttynge. h. the middle of. a. g. The moueable
ſightes placed in. a. g, or a parallel from that line, not vnelike
as is opened of the line of heigte, in the backe of my ruler.
            
         
         
            How Lengthes in pleine grounde are ſearched by the
Carpenters or Maſons Squire.
THE XXI. CHAPTER.
            TAke a ſtaffe deuided into certaine porcions as ye liſt, in .100. or
a. 1000. parts. At the beginning of your Length vpon the very
toppe directlye ſtandinge: ſet the inwarde angle of the ſquire:
lift vp or put downe this inſtrument vntyle ye ſee the fardiſt parte of your longitude. I meane vntyll your ſight runnynge from that
angle, to the ende of your ſquire come vnto the fardeſt parte of that
length. The ſquire ſo remaininge, and the ſtaffe not remoued frome
hys height, marke where the other ende of the ſquyre next vnto you
noteh vpon the groūde. See what proporcion the ſtaffe then beareth
to the part of the grounde, which the nereſt ende of the ſquyre poynted
vnto from the ſtaffe, the ſame ſhal the Length haue to the quantitie
of the ſayed ſtaffe.
            
               Enſample.
               THe ſtaffe.The cauſe is taken oute of Euclide. 32. pro. 1. boke: and the. 4. pro. 6. boke. a. c. in this figure is imagined .6. fote, & the ſpace. a. d.
2. fote, Conſideringe nowe that .6. the length of the ſtaffe conteinet
.2. thriſe, therefore the lōgitude deſired. a. b. of force muſte
conteyne thre tymes the ſtaffe (whiche ſtaffe is .6. fote,) that maketh
18. fote. As this is proued true by a ſmall groūde in the figure folowinge:
ſo the arte fayleth not in a greater ſpace, whiche the good ſpeculator
and diligente practiſer by anye waye canne not denye. Yet
experience willeth me this to confeſſe, that the ſquire is not conuenient
for any longe diſtance, but the Inſtrumēt Geometrical (whoſe
makinge and vſe ye may parceaue in the treatice folowinge) vnleſſe
ye aſſend ſome Tree or turret for your ayde, which length knowen,
ſhall ſtande in the ſteade of youre ſtaffe.

               A Note.
               IT behoueth you to haue a fyne coarde, made faſt in the vpper
parte of your ſtaffe. c. whyche ſhall be tyed euen wyth the inwarde
edge of the ſquire, and ſo drawen to the grounde, where
the neare ende of the ſquare from the ſtaffe poynted, as ye ſee. d. c. the
other ende then truelye directinge to the fardeſt diſtaunce.
               Knowe that the grounde muſte be very playne and leauel, otherwyſe
erroure enſueth.
               Thus the vſe of the Squyre is here ſomewhat declared, but more
in my generall Prognoſtication, yea, mooſte plentifullye hereafter
(God ſparinge lyfe) in a booke titled ye rare vſe of ye Squire in practiſes
Mathematicall: in the which boke profitable pleſaunte experiences
ſhall be playnelye opened (onelye of me practiſed) as well of Perſpectiue,
as of the Mathematicals in generall.
               I Had thought here folowinge to haue placed the ready handelynge
of the compaſſe, yea and to haue ſhewed the fygurynge
and true makynge of all maner letters, bothe Texte and Romayn,
wyth the beſt proporcyon, the quantity as ye would demaūde,
beſides that, ſo to place them in height and nearer to the ſight, that
they beyng of diuers magnitudes myght appeare to the eye, of one
bygnes. This when I did attempt to brynge to their capacitie, ſemed
ſomewhat dificulte wythout pennynge many wordes. Wherfore I
omitted it, belongyng rather to the Paynter, then to the Carpenter
for whoſe ſake onely the reſt afore ſemeth to be compiled. Here after
(as I ſe men deſirefull) my endeuour may be to adde that,
and other thinges neceſſarie.

TO THE READER.
            
               I Sayde in the begynninge that no lyttle boke
woulde conteyne the makynge, and manyfolde
fruites of this pryncely Inſtrument, if
it were ſet forthe as it ought to be.
            Certes the trueth euen here maketh mee
confeſſe the ſame:He that deſireth manifold fruites of this inſtrumēt, legat gē me fricii de radio aſtronomico, & geometrico, librum. yea, that there is no inſtrument
ſo generall and profitably pleaſaunt.
            Notwithſtandinge knowe (gentle reader)
that the occaſion of his chiefe vſe and profite
is not here mynyſtred: neyther (to ſay the trueth) doth it apperteine
to, or agree with the capacitie of ſuche Artificers. Therfore I ſhall
leaue to intreate of his ample large vſe, and beſt makynge, and wyl
ſette hym foorthe in fewe woordes: yea, ſufficientlye for the Landemeaters
capacitye, or Carpenters purpoſe, that at the leaſte they
maye receaue ſome kynde of fruite with the Geometrer.
And in tyme to come (by other meanes) as I ſe cauſe I
wyll largely declare, and there decke him wyth
hys proper beauties. Here nowe foloweth
the makyng, and ſo brieflye
howe he is applied
for the profite
of the afore named
Artificers.
            
               
               The makinge of this profitable Rodde or Staffe.
THE FIRST CHAPTER.
               
                  YE ſhall prepare two ſmall, ſtreghte, ſtyffe, rounde,
or rather ſquare Roddes, of mettall or of wodde well
playned, of lyke bygneſſe and lengthe. Althoughe it
make no matter of what lengthe, yet to auoyde the
errours, whiche lyttle inſtrumentes and ſhort ſtaues
brynge, and alſo to beare wyth the rude vnwonte
handelynge of ſuche Artificers:

let your Roddes be eche fiue, or
at the leaſt thre fote, and euerye
fote diuided in .12. euen partes or
inches, as ye ſe. a. b. &. c. d. Theſe
roddes muſte be forged wyth a
vize in the ende of them to ioyne
readely .10. or .6. fote in lengthe,
