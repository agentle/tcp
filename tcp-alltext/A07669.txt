            ¶TO THE RIGHT VVORſhipfull
ſir Owen Hopton
knight: Philip Moore
wiſheth eternall
felicitee.
            
               WHen I conſider with
my ſelf (right worſhipfull
ſir) the great
nomber of externall
benefites, whiche it
hath pleaſed almightie
God, of his infinite
mercie and goodnes, to beſtowe vppon
all mankinde: Although I am certainlie
perſwaded, that no man is able
to thanke and praiſe hym, for the leaſt of
theim ſufficientlie, yet I doe thinke neuertheleſſe,
that eche man hath cauſe to
geue thankes to God, more for his helth
then he hath for any other worldlie promocion
or benefite: as riches, poſſeſſiōs,
honor, dignitie, and ſoche like. For with
out worldly wealth, a healthfull manne
maie liue in that vocacion,Wealth without health is nothyng. wherin God
hath called him, with pleaſure and good
companie: But to a man whiche is extreme

ſicke, riches be noyſome, poſſeſſions
ſuperfluous, honour neclected, dignitie
deſpiſed, pleaſures bee lothſome,
and companie is comberous, thereby alſo
ſtrength and pleaſure bee altred into
imbecillitie and weakenes.Paine hathe no pleaſure. And laſte of
the liuelie ruddie colour and beautie of
the face, is conuerted into deadlie paleneſſe,
and deformitie. Since therefore,
health is ſoche a precious iewell to mā
               kinde,
that without it, all worldlie pleaſures
are painfull. I thinke it meete and
expedient for eche manne, that hath any
regarde to hymſelf, to learne the knowlege
of the conſtitucion of his bodie, and
to obſerue a meane in his diet, and other
neceſſarie thinges concerning his health
that thereby he maie eſcape dauugerous
diſeaſes, and preſerue his bodie longe in
good ſtate, or at the leaſt he maie ſignifie
to the Phiſicion a greate deale the better,
the occaſion of his ſicknes by due obſeruacions:
ſo maie conueniente medicines
bee moche ſoner miniſtred, whereby
health will quicklie be recouered again.
In conſideracion wherof I am perſwaded,

that all menne that bee of good
iudgemente and vnderſtandyng, dooe
thinke theim worthie of greate praiſe,
and of immortall praiſe, whiche haue by
continuall ſtudie, longe trauaille, and
good experience founde out and lefte behinde
theim to vs their poſteritie, ſoche
an arte and ſcience, as is hable to enſtructe
a manne, not onelie to heale
and cure, a great nomber of greuous diſeaſes
(whereunto eche mannes bodie,
is dailie ſubiect.) But alſo it teacheth, to
preſerue & kepe the ſame bodie in health,
ſo long as the courſe of nature will ſuffer
á man to liue. Theſe be the effectes,
whiche the moſte excellente arte of Phiſicke,
can certainlie performe, to as many
as wil diligently obſerue the preceptes
and doctrine thereof, whiche noble
ſcience, as holie ſcripture doeth teſtifie,
was not a fonde inuencion of coueteous
heddes for lucres ſake, but is certainlie
the neceſſarie gift of God,Donū dei. by hym ordained,
and ſente emong mortall menne, to
the ende that by the helpe thereof, thei
might the longer ſuſtaine, and preſerue

their fraile bodies in health, preuenting
ſickenes that would enſue, and curyng
that whiche is preſente, whiche thinges
are euidentlie declared, in diuerſe places
of the Bible, but moſte plainlie in the .38▪
chapiter of Eccleſiaſt. where it is writtē
after this ſorte. Affice medicum ſuis honoribus

giue vnto the Phiſicion due honour and
rewards, that thou maieſt haue his help
in time of nede, for the Lorde hath ordained

The Lorde hath made medicines on the
yearth: and a wiſe man will not contēne
them. Geue place vnto the Phiſicion, for
the lorde hath ordained him. By whiche
wordes it is euident, that Phiſike is ordained
of God, for the profite and commoditie
of all mākind, whiche although

perchaunce it hath been, and is abuſed,
ought neuer the more to bee hated or diſpiſed.
For, there is no ſcience nor knowlege
in the worlde, ſo perfecte and good,
but that it hath been of euill perſones abuſed:
As it is euident, the holie ſcriptures

                  •
               , haue
ſondrie tymes heretofore, been abuſed of

of Arrians, Anabaptiſtes, and the damnable,A ſecr

&c. which wrieth & wreſteth the ſcriptures,
to their erronious and Deuiliſhe opinions,
deceiuyng the ignoraunte people,
& bringing them to vtter diſtrucciō.
            In ſo moche therefore as Phiſike is ſo
highlie commended to vs in his holie
ſcripture, as a ſpeciall gifte of God, and
alſo it is knowen to be, by daielie experience,
moſte commodious, profitable,
and neceſſarie for all kinde of perſones,
beyng indued with vnderſtandyng, not
beyng ignorant al together in ſoch preceptes
thereof, as doe neceſſarily pertain
to the preſeruaciō of his health. So that

eche man ſhould ſo farre forthe beholde
his owne bodie, that he might by diligēt
obſeruacion, knowe when he were in
healthe, and what diet he ought chieflie
to obſerue, for to preſerue theſame in
health and good ſtate, whiche thyng if it
were well obſerued, would redounde
moſte certainly, to the greate commoditie
of an infinite noumber of people, defendyng
them from diuers paines and
diſeaſes, into the whiche, many thorowe
their owne ignoraunce and necligence,
dooe often tymes fall. And therefore,
I thought it verie good, to wiſhe
all menne, to ſeeke the knowledge of
ſoche thynges, as concerne healthe. For
which cauſe (right worſhipful ſir) I haue
endeuoired my ſelf (as moche as in me
lieth) to declare and comprehende in this
ſmall treatiſe, ſoche rules of Phiſicke as
are profitable to bee knowen and obſerued,
of all ſoche as bee deſirous to preſerue
their bodies in healthe. Not arrogantlie
preſumyng hereby, to enſtructe
the learned and ſkilfull: but beyng moued
with good will and naturall affeccion,

to the readers hereof, accordyng to
my ſimple knowledge, I purpoſe by this
my ſmalle trauaille, to declare vnto the
willyng minded, good rules of Phiſike,
wherein the hope of health doe conſiſte.Hope of Health.
And alſo to preſcribe vnto them, the vſe
and commodities of a good Gardaine,
with the names, natures, and vertues of
diuers herbes, whiche are very requiſite
for meates and medicines. Beyng partlie
prouoked therunto, by that whiche I
haue perceiued in your owne ſelf, that
neither good will hath béen wāting, nor
coſte ſpared, to make a pleaſant ground,
furniſhed with many holſome and ſwete
herbes and flowers, as at this preſente
tyme appereth, at your aunciēt Manſion
called Cockfeld halle, whiche example I
would wiſhe many gētlemē ſhould imitate.
But chiefly again I was moued, to
write ſomwhat of a gardein and herbes,
becauſe the greateſt part of curing of diſeaſes
by medicines, doeth cōſiſte in herbes,
whiche ye vulgare people ar ſo ignoraunt
in, that thei neither knowe them,
nor yet dooe endeuoire theim ſelues to

haue any ſtore of them in their Gardaines,
whiche is greatlie to their diſcommoditie.
Truely theſe cauſes moued me
after that I had declared, what thynges
were mete to be knowen and obſerued,
for preſecuaciō of health, to ſpeake ſomwhat
of the commodities of a Gardain,
that is well furniſhed with ſundrie herbes:
declaryng alſo the names, natures,
and vertues, of ſoche herbes as be moſte
common in this region of Englande, to
thentente I might prouoke the common
people, to haue herbes in better eſtimacion,
and to learne to knowe theim, to
plant them, and ſowe them in their gardaines,
cheriſhyng theim as thynges,
whereby thei maie obtaine remeadie of
painfull diſeaſes, by the coūſaill of a diſcrete
Phiſicion, without any great coſte
or trauail. To this ende I haue declared
vnto your worſhip, my purpoſe and intente,
in publiſhyng this ſmall treatiſe,
whiche I dooe dedicate vnto you, as an
aſſured token of my duetie, & good harte
towardes your worſhip, beyng thereto
prouoked, by the ſingulare benefites, receiued

at your hādes. For whiche benefites
(accordyng to my habilitie) in ſteede

by this ſimple gifte, that I am not
vnmindfull of my duetie. Wherefore I
deſire you (right worſhipfull ſir) to accepte

hath voucheſaued to lende me, in good

IN this former Kalender, what daie of
any monethe you doe choſe, you ſhall
ſtraight finde in the firſt rowe toward
the lefte hande, in what ſigne, and in
what degree the Sonne is in. In the ſeconde
rowe you ſhall finde what hower, and what
minute the Sonne ſetteth. In the fowerth row
is declared the lengthe of the daie, betwene
Sonne and Sonne, in howers and minutes.
In the fifte rowe is ſet forthe the length of the
night, from Sonne ſette, to Sonne riſe. In the
ſixte rowe is the noumber of daies of the moneth.
And in the ſeuenth rowe is the golden
noumber. Laſte of all is the dominicall letter,
and the ſainctes daies. As for example. If you
looke the ſeconde daie of Aprill, ſtraighte you
ſhal finde in the firſt rowe, that the Sonne is in
the .22. degree of Aries. The Sonne riſeth. 16.
minutes after .5. of the clocke, and ſetteth .44.
minutes after .6. of the clocke, the daie is .13.
howers and .35. minutes in lengthe: and the
night is .10 . howers and .35. minutes long, and
ſo maie you finde in like ſorte for any daie,
throughout the whole yere.
            Note, when I ſpeake of minutes, that there
bee in an hower .60. minutes: and ſo .45. minutes

bee three quarters of an hower, and .30.
minutes bee halfe an hower, and .15. make a
quarter of an hower. So that when I ſaied before,
yt the ſecond day of Aprill, the Sonne riſeth
.16. minutes after .5. of the clocke, I meane
it riſeth one quarter of an hower and a minute
after .5. And ſo vnderſtande likewiſe of all minutes.
Note, that there bee .12. ſignes in the
Zodiacke of the heauens, and euery ſigne is
deuided into .30. degrees: ſo that a degrée is the
30. parte of a ſigne.
            The names and Charectes of the .12. ſignes
are theſe ♈ Aries, ♉ Taurus, ♊ Gemini, ♋
Cancer, ♌ Leo, ♍ Virgo, ♎ Libra, ♏ Scorpio
♐ Sagittarius, ♑ Capricornus, ♒ Aquarius,
♓ Piſces. Theſe thynges I haue thought good
to be added in the ende of the Kalender, for the
better inſtruccion of them that bee ignoraunt,
leſte if thei ſhould doubt in any parte of it, thei

                   which thing Galen
the Prince of all Phiſitions declared in
him ſelf, who although by nature he had
a weake body which was ſubiect to many
diſeaſes in his youth, yet he cōfeſſeth
him ſelfe, that after eightene yeares of
age being thē ſomewhat ſkilful in phiſicke,
he ſo preſerued his body, that from

But peraduenture ſome wil alledge for

that there is great difference betwene
thoſe that ſtudy phiſicke only to get a liuing
thereby, and them that ſearche out
the knowlege therof to guide their liues
according to the doctrine of it. Of this
laſt ſorte of Phiſitions was Galen, who
thought it a great reproche bothe to the
ſcience and to himſelfe, if this prouerbe
might truly haue béen verified of him.
Aliorum eſt medicus ipſe vlceribus ſtatens,
                  
that is to ſaye: he is Phiſition to
other himſelf being full of byles & ſores.
Of theſame ſorte alſo, many other famous
Phiſitions haue béen, and at this

haue ben any, or by chaunce at this preſent
be, I thinke they are an example to
diſcredite this noble ſciēce, only to thoſe
that be ignoraunt, rude and vnlearned,
who for that cauſe are enemies of this
arte. And therfore it is a true prouerbe,
Scientia non habet inimicum niſi ignorantem,
that is: none is enemy to anye
knowledge or ſcience, but he that is ignoraunt
in it: if any that bee vnlearned,
doe take occaſion to deſpiſe phiſike as a
vaine thing, takyng example at the life
of the firſt ſorte of phiſitiōs aforenamed,Stomblers at ſtrawes, deſpiſers of vertue.
I thinke I may ſafely iudge that they do
it of an obſtinate ſtubburnes, or of a cancred
hatred, or els of wilfull blindnes,
like as the vile Renobites and Papiſtes
at this preſēt daie, do ſeke meanes to diſcredite

credite preachers as muche as they can,
by ſcrupulous ſerching and examininge
of their liuing, which ſomtime they finde
to diſagree from their doctrine. God geue
them grace to repente in time, that they
laye no ſoche ſtumbling blockes in weiklinges

                  ❧wherof mans body is
compacte.
               
                  FIrſt it is to be noted that ther
are foure Elementes,Elememta inquet Auicenna ſunt corpora ſimplicia &, ſunt partes prime corporis humane & aleorum. &c. that is;
fyre, ayre, water, and earthe,
which elementes haue in thē
contrarie qualities one to an other, that
is, heate, colde, drienes, and moiſture.
And the yearth is the loweſte and heauieſt
element, and it is colde and drie by
nature: Next the earth is the water, beyng
colde and moiſt. The aire is aboue
the water, and is hote and moiſte. Then

cometh in the fire, whiche is the higheſt &
the lighteſt element, being hote & drie.
               Of theſe foure elementes (according
to the ſentence of Hipocrates, & Galene,
and all other phiſitions of that ſecte) nature
hath framed and made eche mans
bodie. So that euery mans body is compact
and doth conſiſte of the foure Elementes
whiche are ſo mixed together by
nature,De temperamentis humani corporis ex Galen
                        ••
                     
                   that none of them doth remaine
ſimple and pure in mannes body. And
therefore we oughte not to thinke that
pure fyre or water, ayre or earth, ſhould
be conteined in mans body, if that he bée
made thereof, becauſe the elementes are
not vnmixed in any liuing creature, but
like as in a medicine made of waxe, pitch
roſyn and tallowe, when thei are melted
together, there appeareth neither ware,
nor pitche,Example of complexions. nor roſyn, nor yet tallowe,
but a thing cōpounded of their ſubſtaūce
whiche retaineth their qualities and yet
is like none of them. Euen ſo in mans
body whiche conſiſteth of the foure elementes
being cōmixed by nature in his

generation, none of the elementes is to
be ſéen or perceiued ſimplie and ſeperatly,
but there appereth euidently a ſubſtaunce
commixed and made of the elementes,
whiche ſubſtaunce retaineth in
it the qualities of theim, and yet is like

he ſeeth bloud moiſte and liquid, he may
perceiue that ye element of water is ther.

And therfore the aunciēt Phiſitions defineth
an element, ſaiyng it to be the leſt

which it doth conſtitute and make. The
cauſe why the knowledge of ye elemētes
is both mete and neceſſary, as well for
him that is ſtudious to preſerue helth, as
for the Phiſition is, that eche of thē may

noted that there be three ſundrie actions
or operations, that proceade from this
facultie, into diuerſe partes of the body.
The firſt action whereof the power animall

                   maner of wayes, that to, by
ſeing, hearing, ſmelling, taſting and feling.
The ſecond action is volūtarie mouing
of any mēber, wherby a man may
moue any member of his body when he
will, and ſtate it at his pleaſure, as the
mouing of the legge, the arme, the head
the tounge and ſuche like. The thirde action
is inwarde ſenſe, and wit, or vnderſtanding,
and it is called in Latine Princeps,
                  
It may be called in Engliſhe principall
or chief.Partlum interios

thereof, that is imagination or common
ſenſe, reaſon or fantaſie: And memorie
wherof (according to Philoſophers opinions)
the imagination conſiſteth in the
formoſte parte of the brayne ouer the
forehead, and fantaſie remaineth in the
midle of the braine. Laſt of all, memorie
is placed in the hindermoſt parte of the
braine aboue the noddle of the necke.
The ſeconde facultie or power,De facultatibus humani in corde 
                        〈◊〉
                      Galeno. which is
called the vitall facultie, doth conſiſte in
the harte, whiche is the fountaine of life
and natural heate, and it ſpreadeth from
thence in arteries or pulſes, that haue
their firſt beginning ther, into al partes
of the bodie, geuing life to the whole bodie,
wherfore the chiefe action and operation
of this facultie proceading, is the
geuing of vitall and liuely breath to all
members, whiche thing is perfourmed
by the pulſes, cōtinually opening or ryſing
vp, and ſhutting or falling downe,
whiche when they open they drawe into

themſeues cold ayer, whiche ayer dothe
recreate, there vp, & refreſhe the power
vitall, whereof alſo the power animall
is engendred. But when the pulſes or

boiling of humours in the whole bodie,Alie Calide. Frigide. Humide, Siccae. Ve Spiritus. Cor. Sanguinis. Ietur.
for naturall heate is not vnlike to a fire,
whiche in boyling of any liquor raiſeth
a great fume, euen ſo whē natural heate
will turne the ſubſtaunce of meates, receiued
into the ſubſtaunce of the members
of our body, it firſt boileth them and
trieth them, taking ſo moche of them as
is moſte apte and mete. And the reſte is
expelled out of the bodie; and is called
an excrement.
               The thirde and laſt facultie or power
that gouerneth the bodie, is called the
naturall facultie, which conſiſteth in the
lyuer, and it is ſent from thence into all
members of the bodie, in vaines whiche
dooe theire beginne and ſpring, miniſtring
nouriſhement and foode to eche

member. And note, that this facultie is
the cauſe of foure ſundrie operations,
whiche it geueth to eche member, & that
is attraction, retention, digeſtion, and expulſion,
whoſe vertues are as foloweth.

theſe two faculties are miniſters, or hādmaides

Thirdly, by the digeſtiue or altering
power, that iuyſe whiche is drawen to
any member and retained there, is digeſted,
altered, and chaunged into another
ſubſtaunce, and by theſame power alſo
it is aglutinate and ioyned to the member

fower ſondrie humours,
that is, blood, fleume, choler, and
melancholie: whiche humours are daielie
nouriſhed and engendred, of the iuiſe
of meates and drinkes, receiued into the
body, and there altered by naturall heat.
Theſe humours,Sanguis. Vituita. Bilis. Flaua. Atra bilis. maie bee called the ſecond
elementes, or the elementes of mā,
for thei are equalle with the elementes,
and thei haue alſo the qualities of Elementes.
For blood is hotte and moiſte,
like the aire, fleume is colde and moiſte,
like the water: Choler is hotte and drie,
like the fire, and Melancholie is cold and
drie, like the yearth. Theſe .4. humours,
as long as the bodie is in health, doe remaine
in ſoche porcion, as nature ordained
theim in, at the firſte generacion of
the bodie: and thei keepe their appointed
places, their colours, taſtes, and operations,

for whiche nature ordeined them.
               Knowe therefore,Sanguinis vſus. &c. that blood is engē
                  dred
in the Liuer, of the iuiſe that is drawen
out of the ſtomacke, and is more aboundaunte
in a haile man, then any of
the humours beſide: it is ſpread from the
Liuer by vaines, into al partes of the bodie,
his vſe and propertie is to nouriſhe
eche member. And if the blood he naturall,
it is hote and moiſte, or rather temperate:
it is red in colour, and ſweete in
taſte, whiche plainly appereth in healthfull
folke.
               Fleume that is naturalle, is leſſe in
quantitie then blood, it is chiefly engendred
in the ſtomacke, and it is as it were
nouriſhemente halfe digeſted, or halfe
tourned into bloode, whiche beyng drawen
with the iuiſe of meates and drinkes
to the Liuer, the greateſte parte of it
tourneth into bloode. The vſe and propertie
of the reſt of flegme, is to make the
blood to flowe more quicklie in the vaines:
and flegme alſo, becauſe it is liquid
and ſlipperie, it helpeth the mouyng of y•
                  
ioyntes. And note, that naturall flegme
is cold and moiſte in operacion, white in
coloure, and without taſte like water.
               Choler that is natural, is leſſe in qualitie
then Flegme. And note, that nature
hath appoincted for it, a peculiar recepta

on the Liuer, commonlie called the
Gall: leſt if that Choler ſhould bee mingled
with the blood, all the bodie would
be yelowe, as it is in the yelowe Iaūdiſe
And therfore nature hath ordained, that
when Bloode is made in the Liuer, the
Gall draweth frō it Cholerike humours
to make it the more pure.

                        •
                     is ſanguinis. The vſe and
propertie of Cholere, is to flowe into the
guttes, that it might ſcoure theim, and
clenſe them from Flegmatike excremē
                  tes,
and that it might helpe their excrecion
(that is) that it might raiſe and ſtire
vp the vertue expulſiue, to driue out the
egeſtions in due tyme. The Choler that
is naturall, is hote and drie in operaciō,
yelowe in colour,Melancholici 
                        •
                     unoris. and bitter in taſte.
               As for Melancholie it is as it wer the

dregges, and grounde ſoppes of Blood,
whiche if it be naturall, it is leſte in quā
                  titie
of all humours. And it is to bee noted,
that nature hath appoincted a member
in mannes bodie,The profite of the ſplene. commonlie called
the Splene or Milt, whiche draweth frō
the blood, this blacke and yearthlie humoure:
leſte if it ſhould flowe with the
bloode in the vaines, it would make the
colour of the whole bodie blacke; as it
chaunceth in the blacke Iaundiſe, wherin
Melancholie floweth all ouer the bodie,
with blood in the vaines. The ſplene
therfore is ordained by nature, to drawe
awaie the dregges, and thicke reſidence
of the blood. The vſe and propertie of the
Melancholie in mannes body, is to nouriſhe
the Splene, and to helpe the acciōs
and operacions of the ſtomack: for it cauſeth
the ſtomack to comprehende well in
it ſelf, meates that are receiued, and to
retein and kepe them vntill thei be fully
digeſted. The colour of natural Melancholie
is blacke like yearth: it is cold and
drie in operacion, and ſowre in taſte.
               
                  
Theſe ar the qualities and quantities
whiche are naturallie conteined in the
humours of mannes bodie. But if it ſo
chaunce, that any of theſe humours doe
alter, by any meanes in quātitie, colour,
ſubſtance, taſte, or place, then thei cauſe
ſicknes little or moche, accordyng to the
exceſſe or decreaſe, or malignaunt qualities
of the humors, declining frō his natural
ſtate, which for breuitie I let paſſe.

By theſe ſignes and qualities before
reherſed, eche man may learne to know
of what complexion he is of, if he wil diligently
cōſider the ſame. And note that
it ſhalbe ſufficient to iudge his cōplexiō
to be according with y• humour to which
for the moſte part his qualities and outwarde
ſignes be agreing, and inclining.
Although all the properties preſcribed
to the humour, doe not agree with him.
For the diſpoſition of the mynde, and
alſo the ſtate of the bodie, are oftentimes
altered and chaunged from their naturall
courſe, ſometime to better, and ſome
time to worſe, according to the good or
euill education of the partie. As (among

                     ••
                  anie) this one example doth declare,
whiche is written of auncient and credible
Hiſtoriographiers.
               There was ſometime in Grece a man
which was named Zopirus,
                  
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      his vertue. who by beholding
of a mans face, could knowe his
complexion and iudge his condicions.
This man beholding Socrates, an excellent
Philoſopher, iudged him to be prodigall

and vnchaſt: Whiche iudgement
whē 
                  Socrates familiar frendes had heard
thei lawghed Zopirus to ſcorne, becauſe
they knewe Socrates to bee moſte centinent
and thriſtie. But Socrates ſaid vnto
them, Zopirus hath nothing erred in
his iudgement, for certainly I had been
of ſoche qualities as he iudgeth me to be
of, if I had not by Philoſophie ſubdued
nature. Hereby it is euident that naturall
diſpoſitions of men may be altered.
And that is the cauſe why all the qualities
and ſignes preſcribed before in any
of the complexions be not found to agree
to euery particular mā of that cōplexiō,
wherfore it is ſufficient if the moſt of thē
doe agree with him.☞ Note this well. The commodities
that enſue the knowledge of a mannes
owne complexion are many & notable,
for thereby a man may learne to eſchue
the euill diſpoſitions that he is naturally
inclined vnto, he may alſo make coniecture
what trade of life is moſte meteſt
for him. Moreouer he ſhall ſone learne
thereby, what diet is profitable, to preſerue

him in health, and what is cōtrary
to his nature. Beſides theſe alſo he may
learne thereby to knowe what diſeaſes
he is ſubiecte vnto moſte, and ſo he may
the better preuent them. As for example
if a man by the ſignes and qualities preſcribed,
knowe him ſelfe to be of a colericke
cumplexiō, thereby he ſhould haue
iuſt occaſion to bridle his naturall affections,Coloricke men are apte to be Capitaines & Lawiers, but to hoo

and endeuour to eſchue raſhenes,
prodigalitie, haſtines, and ſoche like. Alſo
thereby he may knowe that he is apte
to learning, or to be a Lawier, or to be a
Capitaine, or to doe any handie woorke
wherein quickenes of witte, ſleighte or
ſubtiltie doth conſiſte without any great
laboure. Alſo thereby he may learne y•
often drinking of hote wynes, or eating
of hote ſpices be noyſome to him. Aboū
                  daunce
of ſwete meates honie, garlicke,
and onions, may be but ſeldome vſed of
him. He may learne alſo that his ſtomacke
is ſo good of digeſtiō that almoſte
no grooſe meate can hurte him. Moreouer,
thereby he may learne, to know that

he is apte to fall into certian agues, yelowe
iaundies,Hote ſickeneſſes the cauſes. phreneſies, vomitinges,
and ſoche like cholerique diſeaſes, which
if he will eſchue, he muſt forbeare the
thinges before reherſed, ſpecially in Sō
                  mer,
and thē alſo he muſt learne of much
labour and trauaile, of burning heate of
the Sunne, and of great anger, and ſoch
like thinges that inflame choler. The
like commodities are to be ſearched out
in other complexions, whiche diligent
obſeruation you may eaſely finde, wherin
if they be able to enſtructe the
Phiſicion, he may with more
ſafetie, and ſpede, cure
their diſeaſes.

                  ❧ Of the commodities and diſcommodities
of meates and drinkes.
               THe foode whiche is receiued into the
ſtomacke by the mouthe, is there boyled

by naturalheate, and the iuice therof
is ſucked and drawen to the lyuer by certaine

and from thence that bloud is ſente
in vaines, into all partes of the bodie,
with which bloud eche member is nouriſhed
and reſtored, and by the operation
of nature euery member hath bloud turned
dailie into ſoche ſubſtaunce as the
member is, whereby ſo muche is reſtored
to that member as naturall heate before
hath waſted and conſumed. Soch be
the commodities of meates and drinkes
if they be good and eaſie to digeſte being
taken in ſufficient quantitie, good order
and due time.How the nutramentes ar infected. But if theſe circumſtaunces
be not obſerued, ther is ſcarcely any
thing ſo pernicious to a mā. For ſo they
be of great force, to engender greuous
ſicneſſes, by engendring euill & vitious
humours. Theſe circumſtaunces therfore
aforenamed, are diligently to be cō
                  ſidered
and obſerued of ſoche, as deſire to

kepe their bodies in health.What, when, and at what tyme meate muſt be takē. Firſt what
they eate or drinke. Secondly howe
moch. Thirdli after what ſorte: And laſt
of all at what time.
               For the firſt part, there ought hede to
be taken, that the meates and drinkes
whiche are to bee receiued into the ſtomacke,
be good and holſome for the body.
And therfore they muſt bee ſoche as will
cauſe good iuyſe, & engender good bloud,
and ſoche as the ſtomacke is well able to
digeſte:Beefe is better then a chiken to a cholorike bodie. For ſome ſtomack is more able
of nature to digeſte harde meates then
many other. But note that the beſte and
moſte holſome meates, ought to haue
theſe properties. They muſt breed good
iuyce, they muſt be light and eaſie of digeſtion,
and thei muſt be of a thinne ſubſtaunce:
for ſoche doe breede good humours
in ſhort time, without any obſtructions
and ſtoppinges of the vaines,
and conduictes of the bodie. As for thoſe
meates that are of contrarie qualities to
them aforeſaid: they are hurtfull and
noyſome to the bodie. For ſoche meates

as be of euil iuyce, doe engender naughtie
and corrupte humours in the bodye.
Soche as be harde of digeſtiō, doe debilitate
and make wearie nature, ouercharging
the alteratiue vertue of the ſtomack.The nouriſhmentes of 
                        •
                     iuill foode.
Soche as be of a groſſe ſubſtaūce,
doe breade obſtructions and opilations,
ſtopping the veſſels that bee about the
liuer, whereby for lacke of frée paſſage
of bloud, and other humours, perilous
feuers, and many other daungerous diſeaſes
be engendred. Moreouer, it is to
be noted in this part, whiche teached to
obſerue what you eate or drinke, that the
temperature of meates is to be marked
and learned. For as long as a man is in
health,Foode for healthfull bodies. ſoche meates as are of like temperature
to him ſelfe, are moſte holſome
for him and beſt, agreing to his nature.
For this is a generall rule and precepte
in phiſicke, Similia ſimilibus nutriuntur,
that is as muche to ſaie, as thinges that
are like are nouriſhed by their like. And
therfore hote meates are good to nouriſh
hote complexions, colde meates are good

for colde complexions, drie for drie, likewiſe:
and moiſte meates good for moiſt
complexions. The ſeconde thing which
was ſaied,The quantitie of meates. ought to be obſerued in receiuing
foode, was to take hede how much
is receiued at one meale. Whoſoeuer
therfore entendeth to preſerue him ſelfe
in health, let him take hede that he dooe
not vſe to eate vſ
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      ad ſacietatem, that is
as longe as he hath any appetite,Glotonie, the fruites therof or vntil
he be ſtuffed ful: for exceſſe of meates
doth ouercharge nature, ſuffocating &
quenching naturall heate, ſo that ſome
diſeaſe immediatly inſueth, obſerue therfore
in any caſe to bee contente with ſo
moche meate as wil ſuffice nature, thin
king it ſufficient to haue hunger ſlaked,
although the appetite be not fullie ſatiſfied.
This is a precepte moſte worthy to
be obſerued of them that would prolong
health, whiche thing is confirmed by a
notable ſentence, of the moſte auncient
famous, and excellent phiſition Hypocrates,
whiche is worthie to be borne in
minde of all men. And it is this in latin,

                  Sanitatis ſtudium eſt non ſatiari cibis▪
                  
that is to ſaie: The meanes to preſerue
health, is to eſchue ſacietie & gluttonie
of meates and drinkes.The waie to kepe healthe. Thirdly, there
ought to be an order obſerued in eating
of meates: for albeit that it is moſte holſome
for all complexions, to eate of one
kinde of meate only at one meale, (for ſo
nature is able to make more perfecte digeſtion
thereof) yet becauſe the greateſt
ſorte of menne (ſpecially if thei be wealthie)
dooe commonlie vſe to eate of ſundrie
meates at one meale, I thought it
worthie of obſeruacion, that there bee
not a prepoſterous order vſed in eatyng
of diuerſe meates:Diuers meates at one meale are not holſome. for ſo diuerſitie of meates
might inferre greater daunger. Obſerue
therefore to eate cōpitentely of one
meate onely at one meale, and let it bee
ſoche as will well agrée to your cōplexion,
and ſoche as you haue béen accuſtomed
vnto. If any refuſe to obſerue this
receipte, let them for the eſchewinge of
greater daunger, obſerue and take hede
that in diuerſitée of meates, they vſe to

eate ſoche thinges as be eaſie of digeſtiō,
before meates that be of harde digeſtiō,S
                        •
                     dden before roſte.
and let them eate moiſte meates before
drie meates, and mollifiyng meates before
binding and reſtrictiue meates. For
if this order be obſerued, there will leſſe
hurte inſue.Note this. Laſt of all, it is not to be neglected
at what times meates & drinkes
are to be receiued into the ſtomack. For
foode receiued out of due time, doth rather
hurte then nouriſhe, for the knowledge
whereof there are fiue thinges to
be conſidered. The age, the time of yere,
the complexion, the countrie, and the
cuſtome.Age, Tyme, Complexion Region and cuſtome. As for example, a childe or a
young man, vntill he be paſt .xx. yeares
of age, in wynter or ſpringtime, being
Cholerick or Sanguine of complexion,
dwelling in a colde region, and hauing
vſed to eate often: ſoche a one ought to
féede often. But contrariwiſe, a manne
that is paſt .xxx. yeares of age. in Summer
and harueſt time, being flegmatike
or Melancolike of complexiō, dwelling
in a hote region, and accuſtomed to eate

but ſeldome, ſoche a one ought to féede
ſeldome.The hotter the bodie is, the ſoner doe meate digeſt. Alſo theſe aforeſaied reſpectes,
being ſeuerally conſidered, dooe partely
declare the times of eating. For a childe
may eate more oftener then anye other
age. A cholerick complexion oftener thē
any other complexiō. Likewiſe in winter,
a man that is in health, may eate
oftener then in Sommer. And ſo forthe,
is to be vnderſtanded of the reſte. And
the contrary of the contraries.In Winter heate is drawen to the inward partes. But note
generally that it is good for the preſeruation
of health, if thoſe whiche bee in
health, doe not vſe to eate meate before
that the meate whiche they did eate laſt,
before be digeſted, hauīg exerciſed their
bodies with ſome paſtime or labour, and
then as ſone as hūger and appetite prouoke
them, let them eate competently.
I thinke it be moſte holſome for theim
that leade a quiet and idle life [excepte
they bée cholerick of complexion] to bée
content with twoo meales in one daye,
that is dinner and ſupper. And let there
be vij. or viij. howers,Tyme betwene meales. betwene meales,

and let them eſchue by all meanes poſſible,

ſafely vſe to eate three meales a daie,
that is, breakefaſt, dynner, and ſupper,
ſo that there bee fiue or ſixe howres betwene
either of them. But let them obſerue
that their chief labour and exerciſe
be before meate,Note this. for labour or exerciſe after
meates, is very hurtfull to the body,
for becauſe it maketh aboundaunce of
crude and rawe humours in the vaines
and conduites of the body.

regarde to be had, what kinde of foode

iuyſe doe engender good bloud, & preſerue
health, ſo cōtrariwiſe ſoch meates
as breade ill iuyſe, do engendre vicious
and corrupt humours, and doe cauſe diuerſe
and many perilous diſeaſes. Note
therefore that of meates, ſome be eaſie of
digeſtion, and ſome harde of digeſtion.
And of either of them ſome bee of good
iuyce, and ſome of euil iuyce. Alſo ſome
meates be apte to breede melancholie,
ſome fleme, and ſome choler. Of whiche
it would require long time to make particuler

               ¶The .vii. Chapiter.
               
                  ❧ Of a gardeine.
               
                  
SInce herbes are ſo diuerſly &
often vſed of all kinde of people
in pottage, brothes, Sallettes,Mathiolus in prol. Dioſcoridi.
and ſauſes. And be alſo
founde by long experience to bee moſte
holſome and profitable againſt an infinite
nomber of diſeaſes, I can not but lamente
the wilfull folie of thoſe, that neither
thēſelues will haue good gardeins,
and to plante, and ſowe good ſtoore of
herbes therein: neither yet doe regarde
the knowledge of the vertues and operations
of ſoche herbes as are dailie in
vſe. But if their finger dooe but ake a
little,Commoditie good cheape. they couet to haue a medicine that
is brought out of India, or from the furtheſt
parte of the worlde. Where as in
deede (according to the ſaiyng of Plini)
they daily doe treade vpon ſoche herbes
as be able to remedie many dieaſes, but
their ignoraunce cauſeth theim to contemne
them as weedes, good for no purpoſe.
And contrariwyſe, I counte them
worthy of great praiſe & of continuance
of health, whiche being of abilitie, wyll

no leſſe endeuoure them ſelues to haue
a faire gardein well ſtored with a great
nomber of good and holſome herbes, thē
they will prepare to haue a gorgeous
houſe finely furniſhed with many neceſſary
implemētes ſince the commodities
thereof be ſo great. For as a houſe
is a place for a mannes reſte and eaſe,
wherein he kepeth his gooddes frō theues
and robbers,Ab altiſsimo 
                        〈◊〉
                      eſt medicin
                        •
                     . euen ſo a garden is a
place of pleaſure and delight, wherein
be herbes that will keepe a mans bodye
from diſeaſes and ſicknes, if he liſte to
learne their vertues & qualities, whiche
all men ought to be willing to doe, that
haue any regarde to their health. For at
the beginning as it appeareth in ye firſte
of Geneſis. Almighty God did ordeine
herbes and fruites, to bee ſuſtinaunce &
foode for man: ſaiyng vnto Adam and
Eua, after that he had bleſſed theim in
this wyſe. Beholde, I haue geuen vnto
you all herbes that bringe foorth ſeede
vpon the earth, and all fruites of trees,
to be meate for you. Here it appeareth,

that by Goddes ordinaunce, herbes and
fruites dooe ſuffice to nouriſhe and ſuſteine
mannes nature. As vndoubtedly
not onely Adam and Eue were nouriſhed
by herbes & fruites, but alſo great
multitudes of people in diuerſe ages,
haue béen, and at this preſent be nouriſhed
& fedde onely with herbes, rootes, &
fruites. And we our ſelues although according
to the cuſtome of our progenitours,
vſe to cate fleſhe and fiſhe of diuerſe
ſortes, yet haue wee daiely herbes
and fruites in vſe to nouriſhe oure bodies
withall,The profite of a good gardeine. and to cure ſuche diſeaſes
as mans bodie is ſubiecte vnto. In conſideration
whereof, I wyſhe and counſaile,
as many as be able, to prepare for
themſelues a gardaine plotte, and to
plante, ſette, and ſowe therein, ſo many
ſundrie herbes as they can learne to be
holſome and good for their bodies being
in health, and profitable againſt cōmon
diſeaſes, that it may bee vnto them in
ſteede of a Poticaries ſhoppe, when the
Phiſicion ſhall appointe them by his bil

a remedy whiche they ſhould make for
their griefe, or when there is a diet preſcribed
theim.How to place a garden. Firſt, therefore whoſoeuer
entendeth to haue a gardeine, lette
him choſe a plotte on the Southe ſide or
Eaſt ſide of his houſe, let the quantitie
therof be according as he ſhal iudge ſufficient
for his vſe, let it not be nighe to a
barne, for the duſt and chaffe of corne deſtroieth
herbes, if you couet to ſet your
herbes in Septēber about Michelmas
time,To trim a garden, bothe the maner and tyme, then let your grounde be plowed
or digged in the Spring time, in March
or Aprill, that the heate and drienes of
the Sommer may make it mellowe.
But if you will beginne to gardaine in
Februarie or Marche, let your grounde
be ploughed or digged in September or
October, that the froſtes and colde of the
wynter may make the yearth mete for
your purpoſe, laye compaſſe vppon the
grounde a moneth before you will ſette
or ſowe any thinge, and lette it be horſe
dunge or ſhepes dūge, and let it be delued
into the ground a wéeke before you

ſowe any ſéede, or ſette any herbes, lette
your grounde be ſuerly and cloſely fenſed
with a wall or a pale, or a double
quicke ſet hedge, that no cattell nor pultrie
can come into it. Prouide that there
be continually water nighe the gardain
plotte,To water your garden. whiche thinge if you woulde be
ſure of, digge a well in Auguſt, for that
wil not be deſtitute of water al ye yeare.
When your grounde is readie, then ſet
and ſowe, herbes and ſéedes, the Moone
being in the encreaſe, that is betwene ye
chaunge and the full,Whā to ſowe your ſeedes. and let the Moone
be in one of theſe ſignes: Taurus, Virgo,
or Capricorne, whiche you may learne
to knowe in the ende of this treatiſe.

                  1. Borage. Borago.
                  
                     BOrage is hotte and moiſte
in the firſt degree,Dioſc. cap. 122. In vino animi voluptates auget it is a
comfortatiue to the harte,
and the vital ſpirites. The
wine wherin Borage hath
béen ſtieped, beyng drounke, doeth cauſe
mirthe and gladneſſe. The flowers of

Borage would bee gathered in Iulie,
and dried in the ſhadowe, and kept cloſe,
for thei are cordialles, and dooe comforte
the harte.
               
               
                  2. Bugloſſe. Bugloſſum.
                  BVgloſſe is of theſame temperature,Dioſco. lib. iii. Cap. 22.
that Borage is of: and thei
bee in maner of like vertues. A
Iulep or decoction made of Bugloſſe
or Borage, doeth quenche thirſte,
and prouoke vrine, and thei are good againſte
diſeaſes of the Liuer. The floures
of Bugloſſe would bee ſaued 
                        ••
                     like like
ſorte, as is before ſaied of Borage.
               
               
                  3. Betes. Beta.
                  BEtes bee of twoo ſortes,Dioſc. lib. ii. Cap. 116. Capud purgat aurium doloribus auxiltatur. white
and blacke: white Betes do loſen
the bealie, beyng taken in
meane quantitee, but either of
them cauſe euill iuice, and doe hurte the
ſtomacke, if thei be abundauntly eaten.
Thei nouriſhe but little. Thei bee verie
good againſte obſtruccions of the Liuer
and Splene: if thei bee eaten with Muſtarde

and Vineger, ſpecially the white
Betes. Thei are of a ſcouryng and abſterſiue
qualitie: The iuice of them purgeth
the hedde, beyng put into the noſethrilles.
Thei are compted of ſome authours
hote and drie in the third degree.
               
               
                  4. Letuſe. Lactuca.
                  LEtuſe of the Gardeine is colde
and moiſte, in the firſt degree, it
is profitable to the ſtomacke, it
coleth, it prouoketh ſlepe, it maketh
the bealie ſoluble, it engendreth aboundaūce
of milke, it quencheth thirſt,
it nouriſheth moſte when it is ſodden.
And where as all other herbes engender
verie little bloude and that vitious
and naught alſo, it is very good in Sallettes
for a hotte ſtomacke. The herbe it
ſelf and the ſéede thereof drunken, abate
carnall concupiſcence: But if Letuſe be
eaten verie often, it hurteth the iye ſight
it cauſeth ſlepe. The ſeede of Letuſe is to
be gathered in Auguſte.
               
               
                  
                  5. Sorrell. Acetoſa.
                  SOrrel hath diuerſe kindes. It

ſeconde degree.O

                        alis. Dioſcori. lib. ii. Cap. cxviii. The brothe
wherein Sorrell is ſodden being
receiued,
lowſeth the bellie. The ſedes
of it are reſtrictiue, and therfore thei
are good to be dronke againſt a laxe, the
bloudie flixe, and fretting of the gultes,
and lothing of the ſtomack. Alſo ye iuyce
thereof being dronke, is counted good to
withſtande poyſon and infection of the
peſtilence.
               
               
                  6. Coleworte. Braſſica.
                  OF Colewortes there be foure
kindes:Dioſ. lib. ii. Cap. Cxiiii. They are hotte & drye
in the firſt degree. The iuyce
of Colewortes is of ſuche vertue
that it will pourge. But the herbe it
ſelfe, becauſe of the drie ſubſtaunce of it
both rather bynde and make coſtiue, ſpecially
if it be ſodden a while in one water,Iu

and that being poured out well ſodden
in an other water. The iuyce of thē
                     
pourge the head, being put into the noſethrilles.
Being takē after much drinking,
it withſtandeth dronkennes. The
leaues being applied outwarde, doe drie
vp vlcers and ſkinne them: Being eatē
rawe with vinegre, they are good for diſeaſes
of the Splene.
               
               
                  7. Camomyll. Chamomaelon.

diſſolue, rarefie, and loſen, &
therfore it mitigateth payne, and
profiteth againſt ſwelling & werines.
It groweth beſt in a drie barrain groūd
nighe to pathes. The flowers are to bee
gathered in June, which are to be dried
and kepte for medicines. Alſo of the flowers
and oyle Oliue, is oyle of Camomil
made, whiche hath many good vertues,
ſpecially to mittigate paine, and to
comforte and mollifie the ſynewes and
ioyntes. The decoction or iuyce of Camomill,
being dronkē, doth driue away
feuers, if the humours that cauſeth the

Feuer be digeſted. It is good for wyndines,
Colickes, Stitches: It prouoketh
vrine, and is good againſt the Stone.
               
               
                  8. Percely. Petroſelinum.

                        ſes trabit. the beſt groweth
in ſtonie & roughe places. The
ſeede of it, is to be gathered in
September: it hath vertue bothe the leues,
rootes and ſeede, to prouoke vrine,
to expell wyndines, to helpe gripinges &
Coliques, and it is profitable to the ſtomake,
and refreſheth appetite, making
ſweete breathe, and clenſinge of the

                  11. Violettes. Violae.
                  VIolettes are colde in the firſte
degrée,Dioſco. lib. iiii. Cap. Cxiii. and moiſte in the ſecōd.
The flowers of Violettes,
would be gathered and reſerued
in Marche. Violettes haue vertue
to coole, and therefore they are good to
be applied vpon an inflamed ſtomake,
and vpon inflamations of the eyes,The Panſie is the ſeconde kinde of violettes alſo. and
of the foundament: Generally they are
good to be applied vppon all outwarde
apoſtumations and ſwellinges that bee
hote. Being applied vnto the forehead
or ſmelled vnto, they prouoke ſlepe, and
ceaſe head ache comming of heate.

good for the ſtomake if it be eaten
with Vineger. After it is
ſodden, it cauſeth coſtiuenes: It taketh
awaye obſtructions and ſtoppinges, it
repreſſeth the boyling of bloud, and taketh

                  ❧ A declaracion of ſickenes
and health.
               I Thinke it were ſuperfluous to
declare, that healthe is profitable
and pleaſaunt to al menne,
ſince eche man daily doeth wiſh
and praie, either for the reſtitucion, or for
the continuaūce of theſame. But I ſuppoſe

it be nedeful to declare, what health
is, and wherein it conſiſteth, that thereby
the ignoraunt maie learne to knowe
when thei are in perfecte health, & when
thei be enclined to ſickneſſe. Note therefore,
that healthe is a naturall affeccion
and ſtate of the bodie, wherein eche mē
                  ber
is able to doe that office and accion,
that nature hath ordained it for, partly,
as the ſtomacke to digeſte perfectly, and
to haue good appetite.Note this. &c. Note alſo, that
this naturall ſtate doeth remain ſo long
in eche member, as it kepeth the naturall
temperature, that it ſhould haue, in
heate, cold, moiſtnes and drines: and alſo
hath theſame forme, quantitie, nomber,
and place, that nature hath ordained
it to haue. If theſe thinges bee preſent
to eche member of the bodie, then is
the hole bodie in perfect health. Excepte
ſome externall cauſe dooeth hinder it, as
a wounde, pricke, brouſe, or ſome ſoche
like outwarde euente, whiche doe deminiſhe
healthe, and cauſe ſome ſickeneſſe.
Note therefore, that ſicknes is contrary

to health, and therefore it is not harde to
knowe what ſickenes is, and wherein it
doeth conſiſte. Howbeeit, I will declare
ſomwhat of it, that it maie bee the more
plainlier vnderſtanded of all menne.
               Sickenes is an vnnaturall affeccion
and ſtate of the bodie, wherein ſome mē
                  ber
is hindred and letted, that it can not
perfectly fulfil that office and action, that
nature hath ordained it to doe: as when
the ſtomacke dooeth lothe meate, or can
not kepe it til it be digeſted. &c And note
that this vnnaturall affeccion of the bodie,Diſtemperaunce.
doeth conſiſte in the members of the
bodie,Euill forme. three diuers waies, for either it
commeth by diſtempure of ſome member,
ſo that it is hotter, colder, moiſter, or
drier, then it ſhould be of nature: Or els
by vndecent faſhion, quantitie, nomber,
or place of ſome member.
               Or laſt of all, by ſolucionSolucion. and diſheuering
of ſome partes, by vlcers, impoſtumes,
woundes, or ſoche like: which partes
wer ordained by nature to be ioyned
together, and therefore the ſeparacion of

them is a diſeaſe. Theſe bee the diuerſities
of diſeaſes, whiche when thei chaūce
in mānes bodie: there is a ſtrief and battaill,
betwene nature and them, whiche
ſhall ouercome other. And if ſicknes
ouercome nature, then doeth death
inſue: but if nature dooe ouercome the
ſickenes, then the bodie by little and little,
is reſtored to health again. And note
that in this combare, betwen the diſeaſe
and nature, the Phiſicion is as it were a
miniſter and aider to nature, to help her
to ouercome the diſeaſe, by ſoche meanes
as the arte of Phiſicke doeth teache
hym, maie beſte bee doen: For there are
ſondrie kindes of aides, whiche are to be
ſought out by this meanes. Firſt, it is to
bee noted, that this is a moſte generalle
precepte in Phiſicke:Contraries doe cure their contraries. 
                  Contraria contrarijs
curantur, that is, diſeaſes are cured
by their contraries, and therefore, if the
diſeaſe bee a diſtempure of hotte, colde,
moiſte, or drie, whereby any parte of the
bodie is altered from his naturall ſtate,
then to help nature againſt that diſtempure,

you muſt applie or miniſter a medicine,
that is cōtrary to it, that is, a cold
medicine to a hotte diſeaſe, a hotte medicine
to a cold diſeaſe, a drie medicine to a
moiſte diſeaſe. And this muſte bee dooen
with diligente obſeruacion, or els there
is daunger in it, rather then profite. As
for an example. If a little diſtempure of
heate ſhould happen to a member of the
bodie, there might bee applied ſo colde a
medicine to it, that would alter the mē
                  ber
into a greater diſtēpure of cold, then
the heate was. Note therefore, that the
temperature of eche member, muſte bee
learned & conſidered, whē it is in health,
and then the diſtempure muſt diligently
be noted, how moche it diffreth from the
ſaid temperature, for ſo moche muſt the
medicine differ on the cōtrary parte. As
for example. If a member were diſtempured,
that it were twoo degrees hotter
then it was beyng in healthe, then muſt
the medicine bee twoo degrees colder,
then the temperature of the mēber was.
And ſo by that meanes, the twoo cold degrees

of the medicine, will deſtroie and
quenche the two hote degrees of diſtempure,
and will bryng the member again
into his naturall temperature. Thus 
                     〈◊〉
                  
a due proportion diligently to be conſidered
alwayes betwene the diſeaſe and
the medicine, or els ther will rather hard
then good inſue. But 
                     〈◊〉
                   a diſeaſe be cauſed
by aboundaunce of humours in the
bodie, whiche

                     〈◊〉
                   humours, whereby

                     〈◊〉
                   in ſhort time. And note that
this takyng awaie of humours is dooen
diuerſely, accordyng as occaſion beſt ſerueth:
Sometyme by ſettyng of

ſometyme by purgacion, or vomite: and
ſometyme by prouoking of ſweate, or otherwiſe,
theſe and ſoche like are ſometime
the doinges of the Phiſicion, wherwith
he helpeth nature, againſt the diſeaſe
of repleacion; in whiche the former
rule is obſerued. That is, to heale by cō
                  traries,

for euacuacion and pourgyng,
bée contrarie to repleacion and fulnes of
humours. But in dooyng of theſe thynges,
there ought diligent heede to be taken,
that thei bee attempted in a conuenient
tyme: and that thei be dooen with
good meaſure, that is not to little, nor
to moche. And further conſider where,
howe, and with what you were beſte to
worke that nature maie thereby receiue
more cōmoditie then hinderaunce:When the Phiſici

therefore, the helpe of a ſkilfull and circumſpecte
Phiſicion is moſte requiſite,
for if euacuacion by pourging, bloodlettyng,
ſweatyng, or otherwiſe, be dooen
out of tyme, out of meaſure, or contrarie
to that whiche is requiſite, as if you doe
pourge, when bloodletting is onely neceſſarie,
then is the diſeaſe aided againſt
nature, wherby greater daūger of death
dooeth enſue, then would haue dooen, if
nature had been let a lone. But to conclude
briefly, note, that in all diſeaſes the
duetie of the Phiſicion is, to vſe the contrarie
remedie to the diſeaſe, that healthe

maie bee reſtored, as to take awaie that,
whiche is ſuperfluous, & to adde to that,
whiche lacketh, to ſoften hardneſſe, and
to rarifie groſſenes, and contrariwiſe, alwaies

               ¶The. xii. Chapiter.
               
                  ❧ What thynges the Phiſicion ought
to knowe before be attempte the
cure of any diſeaſe.
               I Haue declared ſufficiētly in the
former Chapiter, how that it is
the propertie of nature onely, to
ſtriue and fight againſte diſeaſes.The Phiſicion is but a ſcruaunte.
And how that the Phiſiciō is but the
miniſter, and ſeruaunt of nature, either
to adde ſoche thynges to her, as ſhe maie
vſe to deſtroie the diſeaſe withall, or els

by pluckyng cleane awaie, the greateſſe
parte of that matter, whiche cauſeth and
maintaineth the ſicknes. And therefore
it is mete and neceſſarie for the Phiſiciō
before he miniſter any thyng, to learne
and ſearche out perfectly, the cauſe of the
diſeaſe, in whiche if he be ignoraunte, it
is more by good fortune then by cunnyng,
that he cureth any diſeaſe. For,
how is it poſſible to help nature wt that,
that ſhe hath nede of, excepte it bee firſte
knowen what ſhe needeth, whiche none
can knowe, excepte the cauſe of the diſeaſe
be manifeſte to hym, ſo that he maie
miniſter thinges directly, contrary to the
cauſe of the diſeaſe. And therefore I can
not but lamente the ignoraunce of the
common people, that are perſwaded, that
one medicin is ſufficient for one diſeaſe,
not conſideryng that one diſeaſe maie
come of ſondrie cauſes. And therefore it
neceſſarilie requireth diuerſe medicines
As for example, weakeneſſe of the ſtomacke,
that it cannot digeſt well, or that
it hath no good appetite, is one diſeaſe,

whiche neuertheleſſe may bee cauſed a
doſen ſundrie wayes, therefore the cure
of it can not be alwayes with one medicine,
but rather in eche cauſe with a ſundry
medicine. As if weakenes of the ſtomake
come of a colde diſtēpure of it ſelfe
only, then it muſt be made hote boſome
meanes. If heate cauſeth the weakenes
then it muſt be cooled. Likewyſe you
muſt moiſten drines,Ex pituita oritu
                        •
                      ſanguis. and drie moiſture.
But if the weakenes be cauſed of ſome
humour that doth abounde whiche hath
flowed into the ſtomake, or hathe been
there engendred, then muſt that ſuperfluous
humour be pourged out, either
by vomite or purgation, with a meke
medicine. As if it be fleme, with a medicine
that expelleth fleme, if choler be abounding
there, then muſt it be ſoche a
medicine as pourgeth choler. And likewyſe
for Melancholie, a mete purgatiō
muſt be vſed to drawe out the humour.
But if the imbecillitie of the ſtomake be
cauſed by a diſtilation and rewme that
falleth out of the head into it, then is the

cure to be wrought in the head, and not
at all in the ſtomake. And likewyſe if
diſtempure of the liuer or ſplene, dooe
weaken the ſtomake, the cure conſiſteth
in healing thoſe members, and not in
miniſtring any thing for the ſtomake,
for it wilbe well as ſone as they are cured.
Thus it is declared at large in
one example the diuerſitie of cauſes in
one diſeaſe, that thereby all men might
likewyſe conſider that euery diſeaſe in
eche member of the bodie may and doth
likewyſe come of diuerſe cauſes, againſt
which cauſes if the medicines be not directly
miniſtred, it auaileth nothinge,
but rather hurteth,
               Therefore let no man thinke it ſufficient
for the Phiſicion, if he knowe that
a man hath ſoche a diſeaſe: as the ague,
the Colicke, the Flixe, or ſoch other like,
that then he may ſtraightwaye (if he be
conning) miniſter a medicine mete for
it.Finde forthe the cauſe, thā the medicine. No, not ſo, but he muſt firſt ſearche by
al meanes poſſible the verie cauſe of the
diſeaſe, which the ignoraūt people haue

long time been perſuaded, that a cunning
Phiſition may doe in all diſeaſes,
by the onely fighte and inſpection of the
vrine.Stereus et vrinae medicorum fercula prima. But alas, thei are craftely bewitched
or couetouſly blinded. For to come
to the knowlege of the cauſe of ſome inward
diſeaſe, the vrine profiteth nothing.
And in moſte inwarde diſeaſes of
the bodie, there ought as good regard to
be had to the pulſe, and to the diſpoſicions
and ſtate of the brain of the ſicke, as
there ſhould be of the vrin. Alſo the egeſtions,
ſweate, ſpettle, and other excremētes
ar not to be neclected, in ſo moche

is nothyng els but the watrie and
whaiſhe parte of the blood: for it is ſtrained
from blood in the Liuer, and ſucked
from thenſe into the raines, from whens
it diſtilleth doune into the bladder, and
ſo paſſeth forthe. Since therefore, vrine
is the excremente that is ſeparate from
blood: there is good cauſe why it ſhould
ſhewe the eſtate of the liuer, and of blood
in all partes of the bodie. And alſo it can
well declare the eſtate of ſoche members
as it paſſeth by, as of the raines, the blader,
and ſoche like. But certainlie in other
diſeaſes that bee out of the vaines,
and be diſtaunt frō the places, by which
the vrin paſſeth, there is no certain iudgemente
to bee geuen by the vrine, vnleſſe
the vehemencie of the diſeaſe, hath

Neuertheleſſe, ſoche is the ignoraunce
of the common people, that thei thinke
him worthie of no eſtimaciō in Phiſick,

whiche can not at the firſt ſight of the vrin
(although it hath been caried .xx. miles)
tell whether it be a mannes water,
or a womānes, and how the diſeaſe greueth
the paciente, better then hymſelf,
& alſo whether he ſhall liue or die, what
diſeaſe ſo euer it be, whiche thinges vndoubtedly,
in diuerſe diſeaſes are impoſſible,
to be tolde by the onely ſight of the
vrine. And therefore it is thought méete
for hym, that will miniſter Phiſick duely
and rightfullie: Firſt to ſe the pacient
and to talke with hym or her,Vſus pulſus. whether it
be. Then to feele the pulſe, & to obſerue
well the ſtate thereof: nexte to viewe diligentlie
the excrementes, not onely the
vrine, but alſo the ordure, ſpitell and
ſweate. Laſte of all, to haue reſpect to the
place where grief is, and to conſider the
accidentes that riſe therof, not omitting
to knowe the former diete, and trade of
life of the ſicke. Theſe thynges then beyng
diligentlie and ſeuerallie marked,
the Phiſicion maie more certainly learn
the cauſe of the diſeaſe, the ſtrength therof,

and to what ende it will come, then
he could by ſeyng the vrine onelie. And
by that meanes he maie miniſter amete
medicine for it, whereby the ſicke ſhall
ſone finde eaſe,Blinde bayarde is boldeſte. and hymſelf great good
fame. Otherwiſe, he might by his error
and ignoraunce, tormēt the ſicke worſe,
and bring perill of death, to his vtter reproche.
Thus haue I partlie declared,
what thynges ought to bee knowen of
the Phiſiciō, that thereby he might with
drawe and take awaie, the fonde and foliſhe
opinion, that a great nomber of the
countrie dooe credite, to be true (that is)
that the ſight of the vrine is ſufficiente

                  ❧Of the vſe and commodities of pourging
and bloudletting.
               MOte that if the bodie of man
doe abounde with humours,
whiche are ready to oppreſſe
nature, then whether ther be

ſicknes in the body preſent by meanes
of them, or if there be but daūger of ſicknes,
thoſe humours muſt bee euacuate
out of the bodie, either by bloudletting
or by pourging, or by vomite, ſwetting,
or bathes, or by ſome other kinde of euacuation.
But I wil ſpeake here onely of
euacuation by bloudletting and pourging.
And firſt of bloudletting. There
be diuerſe thinges to be cōſidered before
bloudletting.Age. Cuſtome. Complexion. The age of the patient,
the complexion, the time of the yeare,
the region, the cuſtome, the ſtrengthe, &
the vehemencie of the diſeaſe. The age
muſt be conſidered, becauſe children vnder
14. yeares of age, and old folke may
not be let bloud without great neceſſitie
require it. The complexion is to be noted,
becauſe a hote complexiō hath large
vaines, and aboūdeth with much bloud.
And therfore they may forbeare a good
deale of bloud. But coole complexions
haue narrowe vaines and little bloude,
and therfore their euacuation muſt bee
ſmall.Tyme. The time of the yeare muſt bee

marked that the weather be not to hote
nor to colde. And therfore the ſpringtime
is moſte apte time for bloud letting, becauſe
it is temperate.
               The region and countrée is reherſed,Tempus, habitus, regio.
becauſe it is to be noted that if the regiō
be very hote, or very colde, it is not good
to let bloud: a temperate region is meateſt
for it. Cuſtome is not to be neglected,
for thereby we may know that they
that haue ben accuſtomed to blede, may
better ſuffer bloud letting thē thoſe that
neuer were letten bloud. The ſtrengthe
of the perſone muſt be regarded, for if
there be great weakenes, it is very daū
                  gerous
to let bloud at all, except extreme
neceſſitée compelleth. Alſo the vehemē
                  cie
of the diſeaſe is worthie to bee marked:
for if it be a vehement diſeaſe, you
muſt let bloud ſtreight, if the former circumſtaunces
doe ſuffer it.
               Theſe thinges conſidered, if thei wil
permitte bloud letting, and if it bee in a
neceſſarie cauſe, it ſhalbe good and expedient
to knowe in what ſigne the moone

is, for you muſt take hede that ſhe be not
in the ſigne that gouerneth that member,Gal. lib. ii. de temp. Cap. v. Malio que abundant ſanguine idioque copioſam ferunt
                        •

                        •
                      cuationem.
wherein you entende to open the
vaine, and alſo forſee that ſhe be in ſoche
a ſigne as is good to let bloud in, which
the table in the ende of this booke, wyll
teache you. The vſes and commodities
of bloudletting, are as foloweth. Firſt,
this is a general rule, that bloudletting
is a very good and moſte conuenient remedy
for all diſeaſes that bee engendred
of aboundaunce, flowing or eruption of
bloud, as be chiefly the feuers called Synochi.
Alſo the phreneſie, ſquinancie,
pleuriſi, peripneumony, opthalmie, & againſt
al inflammations, and impoſtumations,
engendred of bloud in the lyuer,
the ſplene, the raynes, the wombe,
the ſhare, the armeholes, the armes, the
legges: to conclude in al inward or outwarde
partes, whereſoeuer the inflamation
bee, bloudletting is good for it,
whether it be nowe preſent, or that ther
be daunger that it will ſhortely engender.
Alſo bloudletting is good in feuers,

whether they be continual or intermittent,
if ſo bee the obſtructions and ſtoppinges
of the vaines, be cauſed of immoderate
repletion of humours.
               And note that bloudletting, dothe
emptie and enuacuate from the bodie,
all humours alike, as wel good as bad.
And therefore it is chiefly to bee vſed,Great aboſidāce in blood requireth to open a vaine.
when there is to great an aboundaunce
in the bodie of bloud & other humours,
whiche do ſtraine and ſtuffe the vaines,
that there is a great daunger and ieoperdie
and breaking of ſome vaine, or
bruyſing out of ſome flure of bloud or of
choking, and ertinguiſh natural heate.
And therfore in ſoche caſes you muſt let
bloud with all ſpede, although ſicknes
be not already preſent. For by lettinge
bloud in due ſeaſon, the ſuperfluous fulnes
of y• vaines, is brought into a meane
ſtate againe, the paines that came of fulnes
and ſtretching of the veſſels bee eaſed:
The heauines that was felt in the
bodie is taken awaye, and the bodie is
lightened, and made more quicke and

nimble to doe all ſoche actions as nature
hath ordained it to doe. Alſo it cauſeth
natural heat to haue a larger ſcope,
and a free paſſage by opening and emptiyng
the ſtraightwayes & paſſages of
the vaines and arteries. Laſt of all if it
be done in time, it preuenteth diſeaſes,
into the whiche the bodie was ready to
haue fallen.
               Many more commodities might here
be reherſed of bloudletting,Moche profite in blood lettyng. whiche is
done when it ought, and as it oughte to
be done, but to conclude (omitting all other)
note for a generall rule, that bloud
letting is good againſt all kinde of diſeaſes
whiche be cauſed and engendred
of bloud, not onely when the diſeaſes ar
preſent, but alſo it is good letting bloud
to preuente any ſoche diſeaſes if they be
forſéen or feared, alwayes obſeruinge
that there be none of theſe impedimētes
aforeſaid, whiche prohibite and forbidde
bloud letting, except it be in great neceſſitie
and extremitie, for then as the
prouerbe is, Neceſſitas non habet legē,
                  
that is: neceſſitie hath no lawe.
               Here woulde I leaue of to ſpeake of
bloudletting, but that there commeth to
my mynde the common opinion of the
ignorante people, which dooe certainly
beleue that if any perſone be let bloud
one yeare, he muſte bee lette bloud likewyſe
euery yeare,A good note. or els he is in (I can
not tell) howe great daunger, whiche
fonde opinion of theirs, whereof ſoeuer
it ſprong at the firſte, is no more like to
be true, then I ſhould ſaie, when a man
hath a great wounde by chaunce in any
part of his body, wherby he loſeth moch
bloud, after it is healed he muſt nedes
haue the like woūde again the next yeare
to auoyde as moche bloud, or els he is in
daunger of great ſickenes or of deathe.
Whiche opinion if I did affirme it to be
true (although it bee moſte falſe) yet I
might vſe the like reaſon and autoritee
to defende it, that the common people
vſe for theirs: for they can ſaye nothing
if they be aſked why they thinke ſo, but
that they haue hearde manye ſaye ſoo.

Therefore I would wiſhe that no man
ſhould credite any longer this fooliſhe
opinion, being moſte falſe, onle she can
ſhewe good reaſon for it, whiche I am
ſure no manne can dooe. Mary this I
thinke that like as bloud letting is not
good againſt al diſeaſes, ſo alſo it is not
good in all perſones, but onely in thoſe
that will be content to vſe afterwarde a
moderate,Quando ſangū
                     
                        •
                      vehementer as bundat▪
                   and conuenient diet. Thoſe
therefore that doe abounde with bloude
& wilbe let bloud to preſerue themſelfes
from the daunger of any diſeaſe, that is
like ſhortly to enſue and moleſte them.
They muſt longtime after be contente
to vſe a moderate and conuenient diet,
for thoſe whiche be vntemperate & gluttonous
in meates or great drinkers, and
wyne bibbers, they do not only receiue
no commoditie at all by bloud lotting,
but alſo often times they catche more
hurte by it then they ſhould haue hadde
without it, for in three or foure dayes
ſpace after, they fill & ſtuffe them ſelues
with more rawe iuyces and humours,

(by meanes of vnmeaſurable diet) then
thei had before, and often times thei dye
through conuulcion.Si ebrius quiſpiā repente obmutuerit conuulſus moritur. And therefore note
that there is ſoche force & vertue in moderate
diete to eſchue & decline diſeaſes,
that without the obſeruatiō of it, bloudletting
is to no purpoſe. And therefore if
the commō ſaiyng of the people be true
in any body, that they muſt be let bloud
often, if thei be ones let bloud, it is onely
true in ſoche as kepe an immoderate diet
ſtreight after bloud letting, and therfore
I counſaile all men to beware of exceſſe
in eating and drinking after bloud
lettyng. Alſo note yt after bloud letting,
none ought to walke apace or to runne,
or to vſe any vehement exerciſe, but let
him be quiet and reſte him ſelf vntill his
ſpirites berefreſhed and quieted againe.
Note alſo, that none ought to ſlepe immediatly
after bloudletting, but let him
kepe himſelfe quiet & watche, auoydyng
all contention and exerciſe of bodie and
mynde. About twoo houres after bloud
letting, there may a little foode be taken,

but let it be ſoche as wil make good iuice
and nouriſhe a pace, within .iiij. howers
after bloud letting or ſomewhat afore, it
may be permitted to the patient to ſlepe,
ſo that it be prouided for and taken hede
of, that he turne him not vpon the arme
where the vain was opened, nor that he
doe not looſen the bande, and ſo lette the
bloud flowe out again. Afterward lette
him vſe a ſtraight and ſparing diet, daily
encreaſing it by little and little, vntill
you be come to your accuſtomed diet.
               And note that the morning is the meteſt
tyme for blood lettyng,Sanguis qu
                        •

                      tendus. when euery
digeſtiō is perfectly finiſhed, and the ſuperfluities
and excrementes of eche of
them auoided out, whiche muſt be foreſeen
that thei bee ſo. Or at the leaſte in a
time of neceſſitie the next apt time to let
bloud is, when the ſtomake is ſomwhat
emptie, that is, ſixe or eight houres after
meate. Thus moche for bloudletting.
Nowe for pourging, whoſe vſe and cō
                  modities
I promiſed to declare.
               It is to be noted, that euery kinde of

purgation hath that ſecrete vertue and
propertie in it ſelf, that when it is receiued
in a mans body and is prouoked to
exerciſe, the vertue that it hath by naturall
heate labouring to digeſte it, then it
draweth vnto it ſoche humour as it hath
power and vertue to pourge. And therfore
a pourgation is an euacuatiō of vitious
& corrupt humours, whiche trouble
and moleſte the bodie, but not of all
corrupte humours alike. For eche pourging
medicine doth draw vnto it one peculier
& propre humour, (that is) either
fleme or choler, or melancholie, or waterie
humours.Who muſt be purged, and how. And therefore thoſe that
be perfectly in health, ought not to take
a purgation, ſince they doe not abounde
with corrupt humours, wherefore in
thoſe when the medicine findeth no ſoch
ſuperfluous humours as it hath vertue
to drawe, it conſumeth and waſteth the
bloud and the fleſhe. And for that cauſe,
hole folkes are not pourged by pourgations,
but rather conſumed & waſted,
for it is manifeſt hereby, that pourgations

be very perillous to them that bée
in perfect health, whiche thinge is teſtified
alſo of Hippocrates in the .xxxvij.
Aphoriſme, of his ſeconde booke, where
he ſaieth after this ſorte.Pourge no hole bodies. 
                  Qui corpore
bene ſe habent hos purgare periculoſum
eſt, (that is) it is daungerous pourging
of thoſe that be in perfect health. Alſo be
cauſe eche pourging medicine hath vertue
to drawe one peculier humour, there
is good hede to be takē that ſoche a medicine
bee miniſtred as hathe vertue to
drawe the humour abounding, and no
other, or els inſtede of moch good which
it would do if it were conueniently miniſtred,
it may contrariwyſe doe moche
hurte. According to the ſaiyng of Hipocrates
in the laſt Aphoriſme of his firſte
booke, in this maner. Si qua lia oportet
purgari purgentur, confert, & facile feruut,
                  Purge none humours but malignaunte to nature.
                  sicontra, difficulter, that is, if ſoche
thinges be pourged as ought to be, it profiteth,
and may eaſely be ſuffered, but if
it be contrariwyſe, it hurteth and may
ſcarſely be borne, wherefore ther ought

diligent hede to be takē in the receiuing
of a purgation, that it be miniſtred by a
ſkilfull Phiſicion, that hathe certainly
founde out what humour it is that haboundeth.
But alas the greateſt noumber
of the common people, doe holde an
opinion that if they may haue a medicine
for a little money, whiche wil prouoke
them often to the ſtoole, what humour
ſoeuer it pourgeth out, they are
ſafe enough:One pourging medicen do not expulſe thabundaūce of eche humor howebeit, I would wiſhe
thē hereafter alwayes to haue in minde
this ſaiyng of the moſte excellent, Phiſicion
Hipocrates in the xxiij. Aphoriſme
of the firſt booke, Deiectionas non
multitudine ſunt eſtimande, ſed fi talia
deijciantur, qualia conueniunt, that is:
egeſtions are not to be eſtemed for their
great quantitie, but if ſoche humours be
pourged out as ought to be (that is) ſoch
vitious and corrupt humours as doe abounde
and be ſuperfluous in mannes
body. There be diuerſe thinges to be cō
                  ſidered
of a Phiſition before he miniſter

                     •
                  purgation, as the qualitie of the humour,

the ſtrengthe of the ſicke, the age,
the time of the yeare, & the diſeaſe. The
qualitie of the humoure is to be conſidered,
that he may knowe what kinde of
humour is to be euacuate, and pourged
out, for it muſt be onely that which troubleth
the bodie with ſuperfluous aboū
                  daunce
thereof.Debumeribus ex Galeno & aliis. As if fleme doe abeunde
and trouble the bodie, he muſt miniſter
a medicen, whiche purgeth fleme, and ſo
likewiſe for other humours abounding
The miniſter of medicen ought to haue
reſpecte to the ſtrengthe of the ſicke, for if
he be very weak and feble, there oughte
no purgation to be miniſtred vnto him,Whē to purge when not.
becauſe all purgations doe weaken nanure
and diminiſhe ſtrengthe, and the
ſtronger they be, the more they weiken.
Let all men therfore beware of vehemēt
and ſtrong purgatiōs, leſt they put their
life in haſarde and daunger. By the age
of the patient, the Phiſicion is put in
minde that children and old men ought
not to receiue purgations, except great
neceſſitie require it. The tyme of the

yeare is not to be neglected, for there be
ſometimes of the yeare wherein purgations
ought not to bee miniſtred, as in
Somer,What tyme purgyng is very petilous ſpecially the Dogge daies, as
they are commonly called, during the
time that the Sunne is in Leo, for then
is nature burnt vp & made weake, y• ſhe
is not able to ſuffer the force & violēce
of a purgation, but the Spring time is
moſte apte for purgations, becauſe it is
temperate. Laſt of al, ye Phiſicion ought
diligently to beholde and contemplate
the diſeaſe, that he knowing what kind
of diſeaſe it is, may the better finde out
of what humour it is cauſed. As for example,To a tercian the cauſe.
if the Phiſicion perceiue the diſeaſe
to be a tertian feuer, ſtraightway
he knoweth that it is cauſed of aboundaunce
of choler, and therefore he muſt
miniſter a medicine to pourge choler, &
ſo foorth in other diſeaſes.
               Note, that it there be none of the impedimentes
aboue named, a purgation
is good to bee miniſtred to all ſoche as
haue aboundaunce of euill iuyce or corrupt

humours in y• bodie, for it draweth
out the humours that dothe moleſte, and
thereby reſtoreth the bodie to his naturall
eſtate again. But if a purgation be
raſhely miniſtred, either to one that nedeth
it not, or at an vnmete time, or that
it be ſoch a medicine as draweth not out
the humour whiche then aboundeth,Medicines moſte apt to the paciente. or
if the medicine bee vehement and very
ſtrong, it will ſurely put the pacient in
daunger of his life. Theſe thinges therfore
ought to be well taken hede of by al
men, leſt they catche great hurte, when
they hope for ſome profite. But if a purgation
bee miniſtred diſcretely to hym
that hath nede of it in due time, & by an
apte medicine, whiche is able to drawe
out the abounding humour in ſufficient
quantitie, then dooeth the medicine ſingulare
commodities to the bodie, for it
euacuateth and emptieth out al the cauſes
of diſeaſes and ſickneſſes, either preſent
or to come, being engendred of any
ſuperfluous or corrupt humour, as bee
feuers, tertians, quartains, quotidians,

fluxes cauſed of rawe humours or ſharp
choler, Dropſies, Goutes, Palſies, Litargies,Preparaitiue before purgacion.
and diuerſe other. Note that before
a purgatiō be miniſtred, ther ought
a medicine to be taken, whiche ſhoulde
prepare the body & make it apt to purge,
and therfore it is called a preparatiue, it
is geuen for two cauſed, either to deuide
extenuate, and make theim groſſe and
clammy humours, that they may be redie
to Aowe out, whē the medicine draweth
them, or els it is geuen to open &
vnſtoppe the cōduites and veſſels of the
body, by which ye purgation muſt drawe
the ſuperfluous humour to it. And this
is that whiche Hipocrates doth counſail
in the firſt Aphoriſme of his ſecōd booke
where he ſaith, Corpora cum quiſ
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      purgare
voluerit, oportet fluuia facere, that
is, when any man wil pourge the body,
he muſt make it flowing by opening &
vnopening the veſſels.Purge in the Mornyng. The moſte mete
time to receiue a purgation, is the morning,
for then are all the digeſtions perfectly
finiſhed, and the ſtomake is without

meate, there is heede to be taken, in
what ſigne the Moone is before a purgation
be miniſtred, for ſome ſignes ar good
for it, and ſome are euill, whiche are declared
in the table before, ſo that if any
man deſire to knowe a mete time for to
pourge, there he may learne it. A purgation
muſt be taken hote, for ſo it offendeth
the ſtomack leſſe, and it wil worke
the ſoner. Thoſe that be apte to vomite,
and are offended with the ſmell of the
purgation,How to behaue the body in the time of purgyng. let thē ſtoppe their noſethrilles
or ſmell ſome odoriferous thing in
taking of it. As ſoone as it is taken it is
good to ſmell to a toſte of browne bread
dipped in vineger, & applie warme clothes
to the ſtomake, and to waſhe the
mouthe ſtraighte after it is taken with
odoriferous wyne, or to chewe ſweete &
pleaſaunt things to take away the horrible
taſte of y• medicine, by this meanes
vomiting ſhalbe eſchewed. For i. houres
ſpace after the purgation is taken,
let the pacient ſit ſtill and keepe himſelfe
the quiet and without ſleepe, that the

ſtrengthe of the medicine may paſſe to
all partes of the body, if the purgation
worke ſlowely, lette him walke vp and
downe a good pace if he can. When it
worketh, in any caſe there muſt be hede
taken that the pacient doe not ſlepe, for
ſo the operation of the medicine woulde
be ſtopped. Alſo in the time of pourging,
immoderate heate and colde are to bee
eſchued, and therefore a very great fier,
and the colde and open aire are bothe
hurtfull, for the bodie muſt be kept in a
temperate heate.What one ſhould do after purging. After that the purgation
is taken, except the ſtomake be very
weake, it is beſte not to eate any thing,
leſt the operation of the medicine ſhould
be hindred. After that the purgaciō hath
doen working, the pacient muſt be nouriſhed
with a meane quantitie of ſome
broth that will breede good iuice, and be
eaſely digeſted, and after by little and little,
returne to his accuſtomed diet.
               Thus haue I as briefly as I coulde,
declared the commodities of bloud letting
and pourging, being wel and duely

miniſtred and vſed, and the diſcōmodities
that will enſue of thē both if they
be at any time miſuſed, wiſhing al men
as they tender their healthe and life, to
beware of thoſe ignoraūt perſones that

diſeaſes,One medicin helpeth not euery ſicknes & occupie but one kinde of purgation
againſt all humours, not conſidering
at all, the time, the ſtrengthe, and
age of the patient, nor the cauſe of the diſeaſe,
nor any other of the circumſtaunces
afore named, but let theim ſeke for
the counſaile and aide of one that
is ſkilfull in phiſike, and circū
                  ſpectt

            Here followeth a Table whiche
teacheth to knowe in what
ſigne the Moone is for euer.
            FYrſt, you muſt know what is
Prime or golden number, and
with it you muſt woorke after
this ſorte, ſeeke in the calender
the daie of the moneth, and beginne at
the nomber right againſt it, and tell ſo
many dounwarde as you haue daies in
your minde, then marke that noumber
you finde there.The Prime. And ſeke the Prime of
that yeare, and beginne at the noumber
that is againſt it, and tel ſo many dounward
as the nomber was that you marked
before; & where that endeth, againſt
it you ſhall finde the ſigne in the whiche
the Moone is that daye: as for example.
The golden nombre this preſent yeare
of our Lorde. 1564. is 7. that I keepe
in minde all the yeare. Nowe if I deſire
to knowe in what ſigne the Moone is
the firſt daye of Maye, I ſeke May in the
table, and againſt it I finde the nomber

of 8. And becauſe it is the firſt daie of the
moneth, I tell no further, with that 8. in
my minde, I ſeeke the Prime whiche is
7. and againſt it is 14. whiche I meddle
not withall, but there I beginne and tel
dounwarde vntill I haue tolde 8. which
was in my mynde before,To knowe the Prime. and there is
21. againſt which is writtē 
               Capricorne.
And therefore I knowe that on the firſt
daye of May the Moone is in Capricorn.
Lykewyſe if you wyll knowe in what
ſigne the Moone is the 20. daye of Auguſt
this preſent yeare, ſeeke Auguſt, &
againſt it you ſhall finde 18. where you
muſt beginne to tell dounwarde to the
ende. And then from the toppe dounewarde
againe vntill you haue tolde 20.
and ſo you ſhall finde there 10. whiche
beare in minde. Then goe to 7. the golden
nomber, and beginning at 14. that
is againſt it, tell dounwarde 10. where
you ſhall finde 23. againſt whiche you
ſhall finde Aquarius, and therefore bee
ſure, that the twenty daye of Auguſt the
Moone is in Aquarius. But in the yeare

of our Lorde. 1565. wherein the goldē
nomber is 8. worke likewiſe, and you
ſhall finde, that the Moone is in the laſt
ende of Gemini. And in the yeare of our
Lorde. 1566. The Prime being 9. you
ſhall finde by like operation the Moone
to be in the firſt part of Scorpio theſame
daye. So that this rule is perpetuall, &
certaine, ſo that you marke wel the golden
noumber of the yeare that you ſeke
for, and then worke accordingly as is aboue
taught, for by the fourmer examples
you may with little ſtudie bee able
to ſeke out in what ſigne the Moone is,
or was, or ſhalbe, any daie of any
yeare preſent, paſt or to come, ſo
that you knowe what is the
Prime or golden nomber
of that yere that
you ſéeke.
