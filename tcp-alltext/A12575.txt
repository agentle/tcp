            To the Tune of the nine Muſes.
            
               
                  THe Scripture playne doth ſhow and tell,
               How Lot in Sodome Towne did dwell
               Amongſt the Sodomites vile:
               He did rebuke their noughty liues,
               Both yong and olde, both men & wiues,
               Why do you your ſelues defile?
               He often times with watry eyes,
               their cauſe he did lament:
               He wept in Hart, in gréeuous wiſe,
               and bad them to repent,
               Deſiring: and praying,
               From ſinne they ſhould refrayne,
               Leaſt Body, and Soule bée,
               In euerlaſtyng payne.
            
            
               ¶ God doth abhorre that whoriſh Bed,
               Whiche thonſands now therin are led,
               and therin ſtyll doth dwell:
               They yeld their ſoules for Sacrifice,
               To filthy ſinne in diuers wiſe,
               Vnto the paynes of Hell:
               You rauenyng née dy men (quoth he)
               That Riches haue in ſtoare,
               Geue to the poore I ſay to thée,
               The whiche coms to thy Doore:
               To Fatherleſſe, and Wydowes too,
               To pyttie them take payne,
               You Surffetters: and Dronkardes now
               From this your Sinne refrayne.
            
            
               ¶ Then all in vayne, Lot preached ſtyll.
               They all did folow their ſelfe wyll,
               For that was their deſire:
               For his counſell good they paſſed ſmall,
               In filthy ſinne they wallowed all,
               As filthy Swyne in Myre:
               Then did the Lorde commaund that Lot,
               That he ſhould ſoone depart:
               From amongſt the Sodomites ſo whot,
               For they ſhould féele great ſmart:
               The Angell then to hym he ſaide:
               Come Lot and haſte awaye:
               For tyll the tyme that thou be gone,
               Nothynge be done there maye.
            
            
               ¶ The Angell ſaid, looke you not backe,
               To ſée that wofull ſight and wracke,
               Whiche on them now ſhall light:
               For you out of the Towne are brought,
               And are eſcaped from their wicked thoughts,
               Wherin they do delyght:
               Yet Lots wyfe ſhe turnde backe agayne,
               As ſoone as ſhe was gone,
               For her offence ſhe turned was,
               Into a huge Salt Stone.
               Where ſhe doth ſtande continually.
               By Goddes decréed Iudgement:
               Becauſe ſhe brake, and did forſake,
               Goddes good Cōmaundement.
            
            
               ¶ The Gates of Heauen, God opened than,
               So Fyer and Brymſtone from thence came,
               And on Sodome downe did rayne:
               Gomorra Towne they did excell,
               As thicke as Hayle, the Fyre it fell,
               And deſtroyed was euery man:
               Both man and Beaſt were burnd to Mucke,
               And Babes in Mothers lap:
               And eke the Chyldren that did ſucke
               On Mothers tender Pap:
               With Fier were they burned.
               O wofull grieuous ſight,
               They cryed, and ſhryked.
               To healpe no boote it might.
            
            
               ¶ The Damſelles tearetheir coſtly guyſe
               Their yelow lockes downe to their eyes,
               And their Heare like Siluer Wyer:
               Their ſownde did reach vnto the Clowdes
               With bitter teares they cryed alowde,
               All burnynge in the fier:
               Theſe Townes like Gold yt ſhyned ſo bright
               With flamyng fier is conſumed:
               The mighty God hath deſtroyed quite,
               And brought it to the grounde:
               That nought is left the Trueth to ſay
               But ſtinkynge Pooles and Welles:
               Whiche was a place of braue delyghtes,
               And eke of pleaſant ſmelles.
            
            
               ¶ Thus were theſe Towns brought to decay
               Both all and ſom the trouth to ſay,
               ſauyng Lots Houſe holde then:
               And Lot hymſelfe was counted tuff,
               Tyll his Doughters tempted hym to luſt,
               As the Story ſheweth playne:
               Loe, wanton Girles whiche ſo doth burne,
               In Venus pleaſant games.
               If that they may content their turnes,
               And eake their youthfull flames,
               They do deſire their Fathers Bed,
               The cankred fleſh to pleaſe:
               Alas that ye: ſo wanton bée,
               That you wyll neuer ceaſe.
            
            
               ¶ Thou mightie God that ſitteſt on hie,
               O turne our Hartes for thy mercie,
               That now amend we may:
               O Lorde thou ſaydſt, and it may ſo be,
               The Sodomits ſhould witnes be,
               Againſt vs at the latter day:
               O heauy ſayng, yf that theſe men,
               Shall ſooner mercy craue,
               Then we which know Gods ſainges, then
               What iudgement ſhall we haue?
               O let vs bewayle vs:
               Our ſinnes doth ſo abound,
               For in ſhort ſpace I feare the Lorde,
               In wrath wyll vs confound.
            
            
               ¶ O England thou like Sodome art,
               In filthy ſinne doth play thy part,
               What ſinnes are found in thée?
               Thou dooeſt excéede Sodome in ſinne,
               Thou careſt not for Lots preaching:
               O theſe heauy newes wyll be,
               Ye be thou ſure, and ſure agayne:
               The ſtones that lieth in wall,
               Becauſe we doo ſo ſore offend,
               To God for plagues wyll call,
               Therfore let ſée, amends to be,
               And euery one amende:
               Good Lorde I ſay, graunt this all way,
               And thus I make an end.
