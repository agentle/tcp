            1 SIr Prieſt, I pray you tell me of what Order of Prieſts you are; whether of the Order of Auron, or of the Order of Melchiſedek, or of the Order whereof the Prieſts of Baal were. Saint Paul witneſſeth, that Heb. 7. 12.
               Aarons prieſthood is changed; and that Melchiſedeks is ſuch, as Verſ. 23. 24▪
               paſſeth not from one vnto another: ſo that (for any thing I ſee) you muſt hold of Baal.

them from falling vpon the Proteſtants with their whole forces.

hath turned ouer all care of his Church to your Pope.
            
            18 I reade in your Genebr. chron. lib. 4. ad an. 1551.
               bookes, that in the yeare 1552. your Pope was intituled by a certaine Patriark called Siud, The Peter of our time, and the Paul of our dayes: and that Baron. ad finē to 6. Annal.
               Clemens the eight was intituled by one Gabriel Patriarke of Alexandria, Tertius detimus Apoſtolorum glorioſi Domini noſtri Ieſu Chriſti, & quintus ſanctorum Euangeliſtarum: The thirteenth Apoſtle of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, and the fift Euangeliſt. And that Genebrard approued of the titles which Siud gaue; and Baronius of thoſe which Gabriel gaue. Now I deſire to know of you, why Genebrard ſhould like that any Pope ſhould be called the Peter of our time, ſeeing Baron. Annal. to. 11. ad an. 1009.
               
               Sergius the fourth, being chriſtened Peter, vpon his election to be Pope, in reuerence to S. Peter, renounced the name of Peter, and tooke the name of Sergius: and ſecondly, how Clemens the 8. can with any wiſedome be held the thirteenth Apoſtle of our Sauiour Chriſt, and the fifth Euangeliſt, conſidering there were ſeuen Popes of his owne name, and vpon the point of 230 Popes of other names before him. For I cannot heare that he was ſuch an A perſe as that he deſerued theſe titles rather then any of his predeceſſors. And if all or any of his predeceſſors deſerued to be called Apostles and Euangeliſts, Gabriel (in my opinion) failed in his Arithmeticke, when he termed him the thirteenth Apoſtle and the fifth Euangeliſt.
            
            19 I reade in your bookes, that the iuriſdiction of your Pope is boundleſſe: I His dominion. (as

Chriſts, Pſal. 72. 8.) is from ſea to ſea, and from the riuer vnto the ends of the world: whereas the iuriſdiction of the reſt of the Clergie hath narrower bounds by much. Yet I reade in Hiſt. lib. 3. cap. 16.
               
               Euſebius of Chrytoferſons tranſlations, that in Traians time, Pope Clemens gouerned the church of Rome; and Iohn the Euangeliſt the churches in Aſia. Now I deſire to know whether this doth not argue, that Pope Clemens iuriſdiction was leſſer then S. Iohns, ſeeing it is apparent hereby, that Pope Clemens gouerned but one Church, and S. Iohn many.
            20 I reade in your bookes, Bellar. lib. 1. de Ro. Pont. cap. 16.
               that S. Peter had authoritie ouer all the Apoſtles, and that the Apoſtles depended vpon him, as vpon their head and commander, who was to direct them, and to go in and out before them, and to chaſtile them: I reade likewiſe, that after Saint Peters death, your Idem. lib. 2. de Ro. Pont. cap. 12.

For there is no queſtion but Toh. 11. 42.Chriſt obtaineth alwayes the things which he prayes for: and me thinkes there ſhould be no queſtion, but when our Sauiour praied for Saint Peters faith that it ſhould not faile, by the name of faith, he meant a liuely Chriſtian faith which workes by loue, and which Rom. 3. 25.embraceth the promiſes of the mercie of God, which whoſoeuer hath, Ioh. 6. 47.hath aſſurance of eternall life: and if ſo, how is it credible that he prayed for all theſe?

That God is better pleaſed with your Maſſe-priest then with his Christ: or rather this, That God reſpects his Chriſt for your Prieſts ſake, and not your Prieſt for his Christs ſake: ſeeing your Maſſeprieſts are the ſacrificers, and Chriſt himſelfe (according to your learning) the ſacrifice; eſpecially this being conſidered withall, that your Prieſts, after conſecration, Canon. Miſſa.pray God he will vouchſafe to look downe with a mercifull and cheerfull countenance vpon the things offered, (to wit, Chriſt in your learning) and to accept them as he did vouchſafe to accept the offerings of his righteous ſeruant Abel.

            38 It is plaine by Scripture, that Abraham, Iſaak, Iacob, Moſes, Dauid, &c. were holy men, and in great fauour with God. For we reade in Scripture, that Abraham is termed the Father of the faithfull, Rom. 4. 11. and the friend of God, Iames 2. 23. that Iſaak was the child of promiſe, Gal. 4. 28. that Iacob was beloued of God, Mal. 1. 2. and preuatled with God, Geneſ. 32. 28. that God ſpake to Moſes face to face, as a man ſpeakes to his friend, Exod. 33. 11. and that there aroſe not a Prophet ſince like Moſes, Deut. 34. 10. that Chriſt was Dauids ſonne, Math. 15. 22. and Dauid a man after Gods owne heart, Acts 13. 22. But it is not plaine by Scripture, nor by any ancient▪ approued Author, that your George, your Chriſtopher, your Katharin, your Vrſula, your Margaret, were holy perſons, and in great fauour with God; yet you make ſpeciall prayers to theſe, and none to Abraham, I ſaak, Iacob, Moſes, or Dauid: whereof I deſire to know the reaſon.

of ſuch things as were begged of them. It is written Caeſar. dial. lib. 7 cap. 24. Diſcip. lib. de miraculis B. Virginis, Exemp. 30.
               in your books, That a Prieſt hauing his tongue cut out by heretickes, vpon his mentall prayer to the virgine Marie, had another put in. The virgin Marie, digitis ori eius immiſsis, putting her finger into the Prieſts mouth (it was well he bit her not) faſtned him in a new tongue. She helped him not with her prayers, but with her fingers.

Peter tooke time to conſider well of it) S. Peter appeared vnto Leo, and told him that he had amended it. Whereupon Leo ſumens Epiſtolam de ſepulchro B.

               you, ſtealing for need, is no ſinne. And do not theſe two inſtances bewray, that you make of ſins no ſins? But your turning the Commandements of God into Euangelicall counſels, puts it out of all doubt. For though it be a ſinne, not to obſerue Gods commandements, yet according to your learning, it is no ſinne, not to obſerue Gods counſels.

And therefore if your Purgatorie be onely for ſuch ſoules as are not perfectly purged in this life; in ſeemes to me, it cannot be for thoſe ſoules whoſe ſinnes are forgiuen in this life. But if you meane to giue me full ſatisfaction herein, you may not mock mee, by diſtinguiſhing, that in ſinne two things are to be conſidered, viz. Culpa & pant, the fault, and the puniſhment of the fault: labouring to make me beleeue, that though the fault beremitted, yet the puniſhment remaining, there is matter enough for Purgatory to worke vpon.

ſufferings; and of the ſurpluſſage of other holy perſons, ſuch as Iob, Elias, Elizeus, Eſay, Ieremy, Ezekiel, and other of the Prophets, the virgin Marie, Iohn Baptiſt, &c.

Now in as much as you confeſſe withall, that Chriſts ſufferings are of themſelues ſufficient to make ſatisfaction for the temporary puniſhment of all men, as well as for the eternall, and yet not exhauſted: I would know why the ſufferings of the Saints ſhould be ioyned to them? and whether it be not as abſurd to hold, that any part of Chriſts ſufferings were inanes & ſine fructa, idle and to no purpoſe, as holy mens? and how it came to paſſe that ſuch a maſſe of treaſure ariſing from holy perſons in the old Law, the Prieſts of that time could make no vſe of it, but left it vntouched for your Pope?

               Gentleman of Germanie payed a yearly annuitie out of his lands to a Monaſterie not farre from him, bequeathed by his father, to the end that

the Monks therein ſhould pray for the deliuerance of his fathers ſoule out of Purgatorie. Now in proceſſe of time, the Gentleman vnderſtood that the Monkes of that Monaſtery bragd much of certaine Indulgences which they had lately procured, affirming, that whoſoeuer would buy them of them, might deliuer out of Purgatorie what ſoule ſoeuer they deſired. Hereupon the gentleman pretending great care to free his fathers ſoule from Purgatorie, made offer of a good large ſumme of money, vpon condition they would make him good aſſurance that by thoſe Indulgences his fathers ſoule ſhould be indeed deliuered. The Monkes ſweare he need not doubt hereof, for it was certaine he ſhould be deliuered: yet for his better ſecuritie, they procure it to be confirmed vnder the ſeale of their Monaſterie and of their Order, and cauſe it to be ſubſcribed with their owne hands and the hand of their Generall, that by the purchaſe of thoſe Ingulgences his fathers ſoule was vndoubtedly deliuered out of Purgatorie. With theſe aſſurances the Gentleman departed. And when the Monkes, vpon his fathers anniuerſary day came vnto him for their Annuitie, he denied the paiment, becauſe his fathers ſoule was deliuered by the Indulgences which they ſold him. With which anſwer the Monks were diſcontented, and complained of the Gentleman to the Biſhop; who gaue iudgment that the Gentleman muſt continue the paiment of the Annuitie: to which iudgement the Gentleman refuſed to ſtand. My deſire is, you would deliuer me your opinion, whether the Biſhop had better reaſon to giue ſuch a iudgement,
