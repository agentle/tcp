Thys reuerente feare ys the locke of all parfeccion. It kepyth & preſeruyth man euer in the loue of God. and wyll not let hym returne ageyne to ſyn.

Thys feare

contentyth not god / but rather yf yt be vndyſcretly vſyd / moche dyſpleaſyth hys grace / and ſpecially in thoſe / of whome god lokyth to haue an hyer reuerence / that ys the holy loueyng feare that I ſpake of before. Theſe ben or ſhulde be all relygyous parſons. They oughte to rendre to god an holy loueyng reuerence / and not to feare god in hys Iuſtice only wyth a myſtruſte of hys mercy / ſuppoſynge for euery tryfull dampnacion / in theyre erroniouſe conſcience.  Thys ys the ſeruyle feare / thys contentyth not god. but yf yt be vſyd vndiſcretly / it ſore diſpleaſyth hym for yt takyth his honoure & hys dew reuerence from hym / as moche as man may.

As when they ben dulle / ſluggyſſhe / and not prompte or redy to gooſtly warkes. Or when they haue carnall thoughtes / or vayne gloryous thoughtes / or ſuche other / that lettyth them from the ſaruice of god. Then a meditaciō of the paynes of hell / or of godes Iuſtice is neceſſary as a pricke / to pricke them forth and to quycken theyr dulle ſoule to do theyre dewty. Otherrwyſe yt may do hurte / and abate theyr loue / whyche ſhulde not be / for in loue reſtyth all parfeccion. Thys I wryte by cauſe many be deceyued in fetynge and dredynge god / and ſpecyally ſom relygiouſe parſons / takeynge the one feare for the other / wenynge that they rendre to god the dew feare / and holy reuerence / and yt is not ſo. For they only dreade hym for hys Iuſtice / and ſo gyue hym but a ſeruyle feare / whiche contentyth hym not.

            ¶Scrupuloſyte is callyd ſomtyme puſyllanimite ſomtyme the feare of cōſcience / ſomtyme erronious of conſcience / and thus yt is dyffyned. Scrupuloſyte is a dulle tediouſnes and vndyſcrete deieccion or trouble of the mynde / by thoccaſion of ymaginacions of certayne thynges whiche ſemyth to be cōtrary. Alſo yt is callyd the fleyng or abhorrynge of feare by the whyche in a mynde vnſtable imagenynge thynges for to come that byn terryble is cauſyd an anguyſſhe of ſpryte & ſtraytenes in conſcience. But that noble Clarke Gerſon declaryth it more playne and ſayeth.In comp

                Scrupuloſyte ys a waueryngnes / or a doutefulnes and a feare that ys cauſyd of weake and vncerteyne coniectures of the mynde. As he myghte ſaye thus. Scrupuloſyte ys a wauerynge vnſtablenes of the fantaſy. A doutfull vndyſcuſſyd and vncerteyne weake coniecture of reaſon / & troubelous feare of the conſciēce. In the whiche wordes yt apperyth well / that ſcrupuloſyte is not the parfit dyſcuſſyd acte of reaſon / but rather a weake coniecture without deu delyberacion. And that apperyth wele by this. Let a ſcrupulouſe parſon be aſkyd coū
               ſeyl of an other in thoſe thynges in the whiche he is tanglyd hym ſelfe / and ſome tyme he wyll gyue holſom coūſeyll wythout ſcrupull / and that he can not

gyue to hymſelfe / wherfore it is playne that ſcrupulouſnes dothe not ꝓcede of parfit delyberacion. For yt is but a weake imaginacion or a feble coniecture of reaſon. It apperith alſo / that ſcrupuloſyte is not the fynall ſentence of conſcience. For yf yt were / yt muſt nedes bynde to fulfyll the ſayd ſentence / whether yt were good or yuel. For after doctours / the erronious cōſcience ſo dothe bynde / as longe as yt is not put a way / but it oughte euer to be depoſyd and put a way / when a thynge is fynally decreed of conſcience / conſcience hathe no doute / but ſtrongly comaūdyth yt / as yt apperyth in theſe worldly conſciences / in byyng & ſelyng / where oftē tymes though they do wronge / they put no doutes. But ſcrupuloſite is euer a douteful feare of the cōſcience / wherfore I may cōclude / yt a man may do ageynſt his ſcrupulouſe mynde & yet do not ageynſt his cōſcience. Alſo a man may put a way his ſcrupuloſyte / without comytyng of ſyn. but rather ſomtyme with meryte. & to thencreaſe of grace & verteu. For as ſaynt Thomas ſayeth / the conſcience. and the feare of conſcience ben tow thinges. To do ageynſt the conſcience is ſyn. but to do agenſt the feare or waueryng doutfulnes of the conſcience may be without ſyn / what ſo euer acte be wythout doute and feare: that ys no ſcrupul / ne may be callyd a ſcrupuloſyte. And cōtrary wyſe. That acte that procedeth not of parfyt delyberacion / but is in feare & doute / yt ſemyth a ſcrupulouſnes. Thus we haue ſhewyd you the nature of ſcrupuloſyte.
