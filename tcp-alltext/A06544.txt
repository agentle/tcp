A chorle whiche hadde luſte and corage

               Hedged and diched to make it ſure & ſtronge
            
            
               Alle the alyes were made playn with ſonde
               The benches couered with newe turues grene.
               With the ſote herbes and condutes at the hunde
               That wellyd vp ayenſt the ſonne ſhene
               Lyke vnto ſiluer or any criſtal clene

               Rounde as a beral their bemys out ſhewynge.
            
            
               In myddes of the gardyn ſtode a freſſhe laurel
               Theron a byrde ſyngyng day and nyght.
               With ſhynyng fethers brighter than gold wyre
               Whiche with her ſong made heuy hertes lighte.

               How towarde euyn and in the dawnynge.
               She dyd her peyne mooſte amerouſly to ſynge
            
            
               Eſperus enforced her corage
               To warde ewyn when phebus went to weſt
               Amonge the braunches to take her auantage.

               To ſynge agayn as it were her dewe
               Erly on morowe the day after to ſalewe

               Euyn and morowe to here the byrdes ſonge
               And the ſwete ſugred armony
               with vncouthe warbles & tones drawe a longe

               Tyl on the moro we whan titan dyd ſhyne clet̄
               
               The byrde was trapped & caught in a pantere.
            
            
               The chorl was glad that he the byrde had take
               Mery of chere of loke and of viſage
               And in al haſte he caſte for to make
               within his houſe a pretty lytel cage.
               And with her ſonge to reioyſe his corage
               Tyl at the laſte the cely byrde abrayde.
               And ſoburly vnto the chorle ſhe ſayde
            
            
               I am nowe take and ſtonde vndre daunger

               And though my cage forged were of golde.
               And the penacles of beral and criſtal
               I remembre a prouerbe ſaide of olde
               who leſith his fredom he leſith alle

               Lyke to poyſon in colour ſhyneth bright
               I am a fole to tel al at onye
               Or to teche a chorle the pryce of precioꝰ ſtones.
            
            
               Men ſhulde not put a precious margarite.
               As rubyes ſaphires and other ſtones ynde
               Emeraudes nor rounde perles whyte
               A fore rude ſwyne that loue draffe of kynde
               For a ſowe delyteth as I fynde
               More in foule draffe her pigges for to glade
               Than in al the pery that cūmeth of garnade.
            
            
               Eche thinge draweth to his ſemblable
               Fyſſhes in the ſee beſtes on the grounde.
               The ayr for foules is cōmendable
               And to the plough man for to tylle the londe
               And a chorle to haue a muk forke in honde
               
                  
I leſe my tyme any more to tary.
               Or to teche a chorle of the lapidary.
            
            
               That thou haddeſt thou gettyſt nomore ayen

               To let me go thou were foul ouirſeen
               To leſe thy richeſſe only of folye
               I am nowe fre to ſynge and to flye / 
               where that me lyſte he is a fole at alle
               That gothe at large & maketh him ſelf a thral

               For bettre is to ſynge on thornes ſharpe
               Than in a cage with a chorle to carpe.
               For it was ſaide of follres yere a gone
               That a chorles hyrde is often woby goue
               The chorle felt his herte at weyn
               For very ſorowe and aſondre ryue
               Alas quod he I may wele wepe and pleyn.
               As a wretche neuir lyke to the nor thryue.
               But to morne in pouerte al my lyue
               For of folye and of wylfulneſſe
               I haue loſte holy al my richeſſe

               And had greate treſoure late in my kepinge
               whiche myght haue made longe for to ꝯtynue.
               with that ſtone to haue lyued lyke a kynge
               Or if that I hadde ſet it in a rynge
               Borne it vpon me I hadde gode ynough

               whanne the byrde herde the chorle thus morne.
               And howe that he was heuy of his chere.
               She toke her flight and gan ayen retorne
