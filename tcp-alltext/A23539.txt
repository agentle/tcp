vnto God for the preſeruation of his Church, our Queene and
Realme, againſt all Traytours, Rebels, and Papiſticall
Enemies.
            Preſerue thy Seruaunt Lord,
            
               Elizabeth our Queene:
            Be thou her ſhield and ſword,
            Now let thy power be ſeene.
            That this our Quéene annoynted,
            May vanquiſh al her foes:
            And as by thee appoynted,
            Let her lay ſword on thoſe.
            
               
            
            Geue Lord true faythful hartes,
            To vs her Subiectes al:
            That we play not the partes,
            Of theſe Traitours that fal
            Both from their God and Prince,
            And from their lawful othes:
            All ſuch O Lord conuince,
            And geue them ouerthrowes.
            ¶Syng this after the tune of the .cxxxvij. Pſalme, which begins VVhen as we ſat in Babilon. Or ſuch lyke.
            
               
                  OVr liuyng God to thee we cry,
               Now tend vnto our playnt:
               Behold thy Church and family,
               Which enmies ſeeke to faynt.
               And though our ſyns haue moued thee
               Iuſt plagues on vs to poure:
               Yet let thy Chriſtes death ſhortly
               Thy wrath vp cleane deuour.
            
            
               Correct vs Lord by thine own hand,
               And leaue vs not to thoſe:
               That do thee and thy truth withſtand
               Like diulyſh deadly foes.
               For better is it for vs Lord
               Into thy handes to fall:
               Then vnto them for to accord,
               Which in hell periſh ſhall.
            
            
               Behold (O Lord) thine enmies rage
               Againſt thee and thy Chriſt:
               Not our ſyns they ſeeke to aſwage,
               But thy truth to reſiſt.
               And ſhall our ſyns then be a let
               For thee them to withſtand:
               Seing againſt thee they be ſet?
               No Lord, ſet to thy hand.
            
            
               For thine the glory is, not ours
               Which they ſeeke to ſuppres:
               Bend therfore Lord thine hoſt of powrs
               And this thy cauſe redres.
               Reſiſt theſe Rebels and Traytours,
               With Papiſtes euery one:
               Which thy poore people ſo deuours
               In euery nacion.
            
            
               Let not the wicked thus preuayle,
               To vexe thy Church and Sayntes:
               But ſtroy them from the head to tayle,
               Let none bewayle their playntes.
               Lord heare the cry of Fatherles.
               And Wyddowes which do mone:
               The which theſe enmies do oppres
               With miſchiefes many one.
            
            
               Defend O God our gracious Queene,
               From Pope Rebel, and all:
               And as by her thy woorkes be ſeene,
               So let thy wrath now fall
               Vpon all thoſe that vexe thy truth,
               Our Queene, our Realme and ſtate:
               And let their vicious prankes of ruth
               Light vpon their own pace.
            
            
               So ſhall thy name be magnified,
               So ſhall thy power be knowne:
               So ſhall our Chriſt be ſanctified,
               By them that be his owne.
               Wherefore O Lord graunt our requeſtes
               Which here to thee we make:
               And make vs loue and lyue thy heſtes,
               For thy Chriſt Ieſus ſake.
            
            FINIS.
