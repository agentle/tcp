               Coulde not these bloods be pleased
               Wyth mens wyues to be eased
               And in their daughtars seased

               Though thus they had not preased?
               In fayth they shalbe feased
               For I set to my hand
               In fyght wyth them to stand
               By water and by lande
               By grauell and by Sande
               And by the salte sea strond

               That downe they shalbe layde,
               As thycke as hoppes and hayle.
               Nowe wyll I them assayle
