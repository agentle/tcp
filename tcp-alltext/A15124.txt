And than ones agayne bleſſe the with In noīe pr̄is. as before / & than go forth vnto your beſyneſſe where ye wyll. Let this be for your mornyng exercyſe.

After ye ſayd morowe exerciſe I truſt you wyll be well occupyed vpon your appoynted courſe of occupacyon. For yt was our coūſeyle in ye begȳnynge / yt ye ſhulde appoynt your ſelfe (by a continuall courſe) vnto ſome certeyne occupacion that may be ꝓfytable / and euer to auoyde ydlenes ye mother and nurſe of all ſynne & euyll. And euer be ware of ſuche occupacions as bē called cōmunly paſtymes / yt is to ſay / all maner of vnlawful games / & ſuche dyſportes as done drawe people rather to vyce than to vertue / whiche more properly may be called loſe tymes thā paſtimes.Math. xij. c. For ſyth (by the affirmacion of our ſauyour) we ſhall make account of euery ydle worde / it muſt nedes folowe yt we ſhall make a more ſtrayte rekenynge of euery ydle or euyl werke. Let therfore your ſayd appointed occupacyon be alway good / vertuous & ꝓfytable. Syth thā ye muſt nedes make a rekenȳg of euery werke / worde and thought (for none of theſe cā be hyd or kepte preuy from your auditour) me thynketh it ſhulde be a great ſurety for you / to make euery daye ones your ſayd accounte by your ſelfe. The cōmune ꝓuerbe is / that ofte rekenynge holdeth longe felawſhyp. I wolde aduyſe you therfore to ſpende ſome tyme thervpon at nyght after al your occupacions / before your bed / ther knele downe / & there begyn to remembre wheder ye wente

& what ye dyd immedyatly after your morowe exercyſe / & in what company ye were / & what was there your behauyour and demeanour / in werke / worde / or thought / & ſo go forth vnto eueri place / tyme & cōpany as brekefaſt / dyner / ſouper / or drynkyng / & where you fynde or ꝑceyue any thynge that was good / vertuous and profytable / aſcribe & apply ye vnto our lorde god / & gyue vnto hym all the glory / laude & prayſe therof / for he alone is ye gyuer of all goodnes / & ſo ouer paſſe that thynge lyghtly. And where ye remembre of any ſpeciall thynge done / ſayd / or thought amyſſe / ſtycke and byde thervpon / & bulte it (as they ſay) & turne it vp ſo downe / & try the weyght & daūger therof / with all ye maner & cyrcūſtaunce of the ſame. So may ye knowe the quantyte therof / that is to ſay / how great a ſynne or howly tell it is / how be it / none offēce can be lytell ye doth offende god / & ſurely euery ſynne / is offence done vnto god / all though it ſeme to be done vnto man.j. Ioh. ij. d. For as ye loue of god dothe begyn at ye loue of ye neyghbour (For he yt loueth not his neyghbour) whom he may ſe with his bodyly eye or ſyght (ſayth ſaynt Iohn̄) how may he loue god (whom he can not ſo ſe) ſo in lyke maner the offence of ye neyghbour is forth with ye offence of god. Conſyder therfore vnto whom the treſpace is done / & ſo ye conſyderacyon with the other qualytes & quantites of the ſynne / ſhall brynge you vnto a baſſhmēt therof / & to be ſory therfore / or (at the leeſt) to wyll or wyſſhe that ye had not ſo done. Than mekely crye god mercy / & axe hym forgyuenes therof / wt very purpoſe & mȳde to be cōfeſſed therof at due tyme / & to take and do penaunce therfore. And I dare aſſure you that this maner of accoūt & rekenynge (though your ſynne

were neuer ſo great) ſhall ſaue you from the ieopardy of dampnacion / whiche is no lytel grace & goodnes of god. Thāke hym than lowly therfore / & ſo bleſſe your ſelfe / as you dyd in the mornynge / & your bedde alſo / & go thervnto / & ſo cōmyt your ſelfe all hole body & ſoule vnto the ꝓteccyon / cuſtody & kepyng of our lorde / who gyue you good nyght & good reſt. Amen. ¶It ſhalbe ryght well alſo that you call vpon ſuche holy ſayntes as you haue ſpecyall deuocion vnto / vnder this forme or ſome other lyke.

                     A declaracyō of the ſayd preceptes.
                     The fyrſt
                   For whan you ſay yt we may haue no mo goddes but one alone / yt is to meane / that we ſhulde loue nothynge ſo well as god. Whā ſo euer than a perſon doth ſet his herte & mȳde vpon any creature

/ more thā vpon god / ſo that he wolde rather dyſpleaſe god & breke his lawes & ordynaūces / thā for to leue & forbere the affeccion or pleaſure of the creature / thā hath he a ſtraūge god / an other god / for thā yt thȳg is his god / for the whiche he dothe forſake god / and dothe contrary vnto his wyll & ordynaunce. And here (good and deuoute chriſtians) be well ware / & warne all youres of theſe ſuperſticyous wytchcraftes and charmes that ben moche vſed / & done deceyue many perſones / that (for the vnlawfull loue vnto the helt he of theyr bodies / or of theyr chylder / or beeſtes / or other goodes loſt or ſtolen) wyll go ſeke wyſemen or wyſewomē (for ſo they done call ye deuyls proctours yt done vſe ſuche wytchcraftes & charmes) thē done they ſeke I ſay / and put them ſelfe ſubiecte vnto the falſe god the deuyll and his cerimonyes / to gette helthe vnlawfully by the meanes of that wytchcraftes forbodē by the chirche / vnder peyne of curſynge. And yet the ſymple people done ſuppoſe and wene they do nothynge offende therin. For I haue herde them ſaye full often my ſelfe. Syr we meane well / & we doue byleue well / & we thynke it a good & charitable dede to hele a ſeke perſone / or a ſeke beeſt / and trouthe they ſaye / but yet it is neyther good ne charytable to heele them by vnlawful meane. And ſurely yt meane is vnlawful. For good reaſon wyll admyt / that no ſore ne ſekenes may be heeled / but eyther by nature / or by medicyne / or by myracle. yf a fynger be cutte / or ſmall ſurfet taken / nature in a whyle wyll hele the perſone. But in all greuous dyſeaſes / medycyne is the commune meane of helthe / but ſure ben they yt ſuche charmes or wytchecraftes ben no medicynes. For thā ſhuld they heele as

well by one ꝑſone as by an other. And no mā byleueth they ben miracles / ergo they muſt nedeli be ye deuyls crafte / yt to deceyue ye ſymple ꝑſones / doth hurt ſome / & techeth yt waye vnlawfull to brynge them into his daunger. For you wyll graūte yt he were a foole / that for ye helth of his hors legge / wold loſe one of his owne hādes / or one of his owne eyes / & yet is he more foole in dede, that for any creature wold loſe his ſoule. But yet ſome haue ſaid to me. Syr / how may this charme be euyll or amys / whan all thynges ben good / as by exemple. The charmer is a good mā or a good womā & taketh here a pece of whyte breed / & ſayth ouer that breed nothynge / but onely ye 
                  Pat nr̄. & maketh a croſſe vpon ye breed / whiche thynges ben all good / thā doth he nothynge els but ley ye pece of breed vnto ye tothe yt aketh / or vnto any other ſore / turnynge ye croſſe vnto ye ſore or dyſeaſe / & ſo is ye perſone heled. How may this be euyll now ſay they? I ſaye agayne it is euyll and dāpnable / bycauſe ye feyth & byleue of ye hole mater reſteth in ye applicacion of ye croſſe / whiche hathe no naturall operacion / but is a cerimonye vnlawful. For although thynges here ben good / yet done they nothȳg auayle wtout yt cerimony / & ſo is all a charme & vnlawfull & nought / whiche maye euydently be knowen for nought & vnlawfull / bycauſe ye chirche doth cōdēpne & forbede all ſuche / whiche thynge ſurely the lerned chirche of god / gyded euer by the holy ghoſt wolde neuer haue done / yf it were good and lawfull. And therfore in any wyſe / let none of your folkes vſe any ſuch.The ſecunde. ¶Now for ye ſecunde precepte / whiche is / yt no ꝑſon ſhulde take ye name of god in vayne / warne your folkes & toke good hede vnto thē that they be no cōmune

ſwerers. For it were leſſe ieopardy for you to haue in your hous a thefe or a ſteler / a lecher or vnclene lyuer / than an vſuall ſwerer. For a great othe accuſtomed / doth prouoke the ſodeyn vengeaunce of god. The ſcrypture ſaythe. De domo iurantis / non receded plaga.
                     Eccl. xxiii B. The cuſtomable ſwerer / ſhall euer be full of iniquyte & ſynne / and the plage of ye vengeaunce of god ſhall cō
                  tynually hange ouer that houſe. Let not thy mouthe be vſed vnto ſwerynge (ſayth the ſcrypture) For ye cuſtomable ſwerer ſhall neuer be clene purged of ſynne.Ibidem. Wherfore I dare well ſaye that ſwerynge is one of ye greate cauſes of all theſe ſodeyne plages amonge mē & beeſtes / as peſtylence / pockes / ſwetynges / and moreyns / with ſuche other. And I byleue verely none of you wolde be glad to kepe in his hous a lepre / or any ꝑſone infected with any of the foreſayd plages. And yet is a ſwerer more peryllous than any of them. For his othe may ſlee or infecte your chylde in the cradle / or ſtryke your beeſtes in ye feeldes / deſtroy your corne and graynes / & cauſe pryuely many myſcheues. And yet many ꝑſones done thynke and byleue / that yf they ſwere trouth / they do no ſynne / but they ben ſureli deceyued / as by caſe. yf a perſon wolde prynte & coyne money of good ſyluer or good golde / kepyng alſo ye due weyght and faſſhon / that thynge wolde nothynge excuſe the perſone vnto the kynge or his lawes / though alſo he proued the money were good and lawfull money. For the kynges lawe is / yt no perſone ſhall prynt or coyne any money but ſuche as be aſſigned by hym / and that alſo in the place appoynted thervnto. So in lyke maner / ye lawe of god is yt no perſone ſhall ſwere any othe / excepte it be at the appoyntment or cōmaū
                  dement

of ſuche a perſone that hath iuſt power to requyre & to take an othe / & that alſo muſt be done in due place / yt is to ſaye / before a lawfull iudge. And ſo may the perſon lawfully ſwere / ſo euer that the ſwerer do thynke & byleue in true & vnfeyned conſcyence / yt his othe is true. And els / yt is to ſay / without circūſtaūces and ſuche other cauſes expreſſed in ye lawe no perſone maye ſwere / though it be neuer ſo true yt he ſwereth. yf than to ſwere true be ſynne / and doth prouoke the hyghe diſpleaſure of god / bycauſe it is contrary vnto his cōmaūdement / to ſwere falfe muſt nedes be more ſynne / & more prouoke his vengeaūc. e Example ſhall I ſhewe here of bothe / that is to ſay / how god is prouoked by vſuall ſwerynge / & how by forſwerynge & falſe othes / this ſtory yt foloweth I herde at Stondon a lytell vyllage .xxv. myles from London / not ferre from the hygh waye vnto Cambrydge / where for a tyme I dyd abyde / in auoydyng the great plage that bothe in London and Cambrydge dyd than quyckly & ſharply reygne / where alſo this ſtory was open in ye knowlege of all the coūtree there aboute / as done but ſmall tyme before. A gētylman that was called mayſter Baryngton / whoſe wyfe was afterwarde maryed in Cambrydge vnto a gentylmā called mayſter Caryngton / ſo that there was but one lettre chaunged in her name / yt is to ſay C for B. And of her alſo I herde the ſame ſtory / all though (as ſhe ſayde) ſhe was not preſent. This ſayde gentylman Baryngton was a great ſwerer / & dyd cuſtomably vſe great othes / ſpecyally by the blode of our lorde / or (as more communly they ſwere) by goddes blode. And vpon a ſondaye or els a feeſtfull holy daye he went forth on huntynge

or hawkynge / & nothynge ſpedynge after his mynde he came vnto an alehouſe at a through fare called Pulcryche .v. myles from ware in the hygh way to Cambrydge / the one ſyde of the whiche through fare was in ye ſayd paryſſhe of Stondon / where this gentylmā was / & called for drynke / & anone he began to ſwere after this vnhappy cuſtome ſayeng. By goddes blode this daye is vnhappy. And in a whyle after in ſwerynge ſo / he bledde at the noſe / & therwith more vexed he began to rayle and rayne god (as they ſay) in ſweryng goddes paſſyon / goddes woūdes / goddes fleſſhe goddes nayles / and euer his holy and bleſſed blode / tyll at ye laſt he fell ferther to blede at the eares / at the eyes / at his wreſtes / & all the ioyntes of his handes & of all his body / at his nauyll and foundement / and at other places of his body / in meruaylous great quantyte & ſtremes of blode / and ſhotynge out his tonge in a meruaylous horryble / vgſome & ferefull maner / as blacke as pytche / ſo that no perſone durſte come nere hȳ / but ſtode aferre of / & caſt holy water towarde hȳ / & ſo he cōtynued euer ſwerynge / blaſphemynge and bledynge / tyll he expired and was deed. And on ye morowe after they layd hym in a carte / & caryed hym vnto the ſayd chirche of Stondon / and euer ye body bled tyll he was buryed in the waye as they came in very great habundaunce. This was a playne token that god was moche diſpleaſed with that ſweryng / & dyd openly punyſſhe the ſame / in example vnto all vſuall ſwerers. It may alſo be a good monicion & warnyng for ſuche perſones that done myſvſe the holy daye in hawkynge / huntynge / and ſuche other fruytles occupacyons or paſtymes. Another example of the ſame

vſual ſweryng was ſhewed vnto me by a bachyler of diuinite called mayſter George werke / a felowe than wher I was alſo felowe / of ye quenes college in Cambrydge / & after he was vycar of Harowe on the hyll / whiche thynge he ſayd vpon his conſcyence. He ſawe hymſelfe in a marchauntes hous in London / whiche was his ſpecyall frende / & ſent for hȳ to gyue coūſeyle vnto the ſame perſone / a yongman yt was prentyſe / or els ſeruaūt vnto ye ſame marchaūt / whiche yongman dyd vſe to ſwere for his cōmune othe / by the bones of god or by goddes bones. And it came to paſſe yt he was taken with a great merueylous ſekenes / ſo yt no phyſyke ne medicyne coude helpe ne eaſe hym / but that he lay ſtyll in bedde ſo longe / that the fleſſhe & the ſkyn of his armes & fyngers / & of his legges / thyes / ſhȳnes / fete & toes / dyd diuyde in ſondre / as though they had ben ſlyt wt a knyfe / ſo that ye bare bones myght openly be ſene & feled. And ſo in ye ſame maner (after he had wt great cōtricion & open cōfeſſyon of that ſwerynge) receyued the ſacramentes of ye chirche / he departed this lyfe vnto our lorde. Here ben now two notable exēples of vſuall ſwerynge. The thyrde ſhall I ſhewe you of for ſweryng / or falſe ſwerȳg / whiche was ſhewed vnto me of an honeſt preeſt of my familier acqueyntaūce that was vicar of Haly well / where ſaȳt Wenefredes well is / beſyde ye abbey of Baſing werke in flynt ſhyre in ye borders of wales .xiiij. myles from Weſtcheſter / whiche thȳg he ſayd on his cōſcyēce he dyd ſe hȳſelfe & was ther preſent wt great multitude of other people thouſandes. A certeyn mā was called to be ſworne in a great mater bytwene two ꝑtyes / whiche ſayd partyes dyd put the mater holy vnto ye determinacyon of

his othe / & mette bothe at a certeyn place where was a crucifixe a holy rode that dyd many myracles / wher vpon he ſhulde ſwere / & ſo dyd in ye ſyght & herynge of a great multytude of people gadred on bothe partyes. And his othe gyuen / he layde bothe his handes vpon the fete of the rode / and ſware falſe & cōtrary vnto his cōſcience / and ſo was dampnably for ſworne / whiche thynge god wolde haue knowen. For whan he wolde haue taken his handes awaye to departe / bothe the handes cleued & ſtycked faſt vnto the ſete of ye rode / as though they had ben glued or faſtened wt nayles thervnto. And than he wolde wt violence haue pulled them of / & than with ſterynge & haſty mouynge to & fro / the ſteppe whervpon he ſtode / ſlypped & voyded frō hym. And thā hanged he ſtyll by his hādes / & ſo remayned hangynge ſtyll contynually the ſpace of thre dayes / & meruaylous moche people came thyder to ſe and loke vpon hym / of ye whiche many ben yet lyuynge. So at the laſt after thre dayes whan he had with great contricion openly cōfeſſed his defaute / & receyued ye ſacramētes of ye chirche / whā ye people ſuppoſed & thought veryly he ſhulde there haue expired & dyed / he was ſodeynly loſed & deliuered / & lyued many yeres after a good & holy lyfe / vnto ye glory of god & great exemple of them that ben ſwerers.li. ijij. ca. xviij. Saynt Gregory in his dialoges dothe ſhewe of a chylde / that (as he had herde of other perſones) dyd ſwere great othes / & had pleaſure therin / & ſodenly whan he was ſwerynge in his fathers lap vpon his knee / the deuyll came & openly rauyſſhed & by vyolence toke hym from his father / & caryed hym awaye / that he was neuer ſene after. Here may you perceyue the great peryll & ieopardy of ſwerynge.

For the loue of our lorde therfore good deuoute chriſtians / take good hede therto / as well in yourſelfe as ī your folkes. And yet ſhuld you haue no leſſe garde or awayte vnto lyenge / or makȳge of lyes or leſynges For the lye or leſynge is very mother vnto bothe ye defautes ſhewed laſt before / that is to ſay / vnto periury or for ſwerynge / & vnto falſe wytnes. For eueryche of theſe doughters / is worſe than the mother.Mendacium. For ye lyer careth lytell to bere falſe wytnes / and euery lyer is cō
                  munly a ſwerer / for els the lye ſhulde not be coloured / dubbed & peynted ſufficiētly to ſeme treue / & ſpecyally in a defaute wherof ye lyer wolde fayne be excuſed for drede of punyſſhmēt or rebuke / or whā a mater ſhuldꝭ (by that lye) come to paſſe / & be brought aboute vnto effecte / for profyte / auaūtage / flatery or pleaſure. For whan the lyer dothe coueyte moſt ſubtylly to deceyue and wolde fayne and gladly be byleued / than dothe ye lyer mooſt lyberally laſſhe out othes / & ſpareth for no coſt (as they ſaye) but whan ſuche a ꝑſon doth ſwere mooſt / than wyll a wyſe ꝑſone byleue hym leeſt. And by this doth appere / that the cōmune & beſy ſwerers ben ſuſpecte to be lyers. For ye lyer is combred ſo in cō
                  ſcyence / that he ſuppoſeth & thynketh he can not be byleued without he ſwere many othes / & great othes. Beware therfore of lyers / for cōmune lyers bē cōmunly theues or pykers / & vnclene lyuers. And (to ſaye ye trouth) ye lyer is apte & dyſpoſed vnto all maner of vyces / bycauſe that all lyers ben the chylder of ye deuyll. For the deuyll was the fyrſt lyer / & euer doth cōtynue a lyer.Iohan. viij. f. And (as the goſpell ſayth) he is the father of all lyers. Now ponder & wey (good deuoute chriſtiās) I praye you / yf you were requyred wheder you wolde

be cōtent to kepe in your cōpany a thefe or pyker / a perſone that ſhulde enforce & labour to corrupte your wyues or your doughters / or yet ſuche a perſone yt were ſeruaunt or chylde vnto your deedly foo or enemy / I thynke you wyll ſaye nay / you wolde kepe none ſuche Than ſay I beware of the lyer / for all cōmune lyers ben the deuyls chylder / & done folowe theyr father the deuyll / whoſe properte & natural diſpoſicion is to lye. I can well graunte that you forgyue and pardon thē that done ſtele / pyke / or do lechery for ones or twyſe / & labour & loke for theyr recouery & amendment / but in no wyſe can I graunt that you pardon the lyers / but euen forthwith / as you wolde cure ye ſodeyn peſtylēce ſo correcte and punyſſhe the lye. Wherfore I haue ſet out here a prety leſſon / whiche I pray you teche your chylder / & euery chylde that cometh into your cōpany you ſhall (I truſt) do moche good therby.

                  yf I curſe / ſcorne / mocke / or ſwere
                  yf I chyde / fyght / ſtryue / or threete
                  Than am I worthy to be bete
                  Good mother or mayſtres myne
                  yf any of theſe nyne
                  I treſpace to your knowynge
                  With a newe rodde and a fyne
                  Erly naked before I dyne
                  Amende me with a ſcourgynge.
               
               And than I praye you fulfyll & perfourme theyr peticyon & requeſt / & thynke it not cruelly / but mercyfully done.Prou. xiii. d. For the wyſe man ſayth / who ſpareth the rodde hateth the chylde. And in another place.
                     Eccli. vii. c. Yf thou haue chylder (ſayth he) correcte them be tyme / & holde them

vnder whyle they ben yōge / your dayly practyſe doth ſhewe vnto you / yt yf you powder your fleſſhe whyle it is newe and ſwete / it wyl contynue good meet / but yf it ſmell before it be powdred / all the ſalte you haue ſhall neuer make it ſeaſonable. Powder your chylder therfore be tyme / and than you loue them / & ſhal haue cōforte of them. I dyd appoynt the correccyon before vnto the mother or mayſtres / for cōmunely they done take the labour of that mynyſterye and ſeruyce. Not withſtandynge there may be ſayd father or mayſter / and the ſtaffe or fote of ye ryme be all one. But who ſo euer do the correccyon / whether it be in laſſhes / or in wordes / let it be done with the charite of our lord / and with a mylde & ſoft ſpirite / that euer it be done for the reformacion of the perſone / rather than for the reuengynge of the defaute / and therfore ſhulde you neuer do any maner of correccion whyle you ben vexed / chafed / troubled / wroth / or angry for any cauſe / but rather for that tyme deferre the correccyon / and an other tyme by good deliberacyon take the perſones on parte / or yf the treſpace be openly knowen / than do it openly / that all the lokers thervpon may be warned therby / and gyue them a good leſſon before the correccyon / and tell them you do the correccyon agaynſt your mynde / compelled thervnto by cōſcyence / and requyre them to put you no more vnto ſuche labour & peyne. For yf thou do (ſay you) you muſt ſuffre parte of the peyne with me / and therfore you ſhall now haue experience and profe what peyne it is vnto vs bothe. And than pay truly / and afterwarde forth with forgyue them clerely & gentylly / ſo that they do no more ſo. And in doynge thus correccyon / you may edify & refourme the perſones / &

alſo meryte & haue thanke of our lorde. Where yf contrary you chyde / brawle / curſe / & wt vngoodly wordes rebuke / or ſtryke with haſtynes to reuēge your owne cauſe or appetyte / you ſhall rendre the perſones more ſtubburne & ſtyffe herted / & engēdre in them an hatered towarde you. And alſo not onely loſe your meryte / but alſo deſerue peyne and the punyſſhment of god / where ye other correccion done by ſobrenes / ſhall cauſe the perſones to haue you in a reuerēde drede / & alſo to loue you / and here afterwarde to bleſſe you / and pray for you. I praye you therfore / wynne & deſerue bothe theyr bleſſynge and prayer / & alſo the bleſſynge and rewarde of our lorde. But bycauſe that cōmunly all perſones done vſe to ſwere ſome othe / in affyrmȳge or denyenge / that is / in ſayenge ye / as grauntynge / or nay as denyenge / whiche bē ſeldon ſayd nakedly by them ſelfe without ſome addicion / therfore I wolde haue you in auoydynge of al vayne ones / to teche your chylder to make theyr addicions vnder this fourme. Ye father / nay father: ye mother / nay mother: ye brother / nay brother: ye ſyſter / nay ſyſter: ye ſyr / nay ſyr: ye dame / nay dame: or vnto ye ſtates / mayſter / mayſtres and ſo forth of all ſuche cōmune termes / as grauntfather / grauntmother: godfather / godmother: vncle / aunt / coſyn / & ſuche lyke / wtout any other addicion / or any of theſe fōde othes / as by cocke & pye / by my hode of grene / & ſuche other.Math. v. For Chryſt ſayth in the goſpel vnto his diſciples. Swere not you at all (ſayth he) in any wyſe / that is to meane / vnlawfull / or in vayne. And the prophete ſayth.Pſal. lxij Ladabūtur oēs qui iurāt in eo: quia obſtructū eſt os loquentium iniqua. That is / thoſe ꝑſones that done lawfully ſwere in god / ſhalbe

prayſed and haue rewarde therfore / and the mouth of euyll ſpekers ſhalbe ſtopped / & they put to ſhame & rebuke. All this haue we ſpoken for the kepynge of the ſecunde precepte or cōmaūdement.The .iii. precepte. Now for ye thyrde commaundement. I praye you gyue good exemple in your owne ſelfe / and than teche all youres how they ſhulde kepe duely ye holy day / yt is to ſaye (in aſmoche as conuenyently may be) to be voyde of all maner of worldly & bodyly labours. I ſayd in aſmoche as conuenyētly may be. For people muſt haue meet & drȳke / the houſes muſt be appareyled / beeſtes muſt be cured & loked vnto. And veri vnfeyned neceſſite or nede doth excuſe in cōſcyēce. The holy daye is ordeyned of god & the chirche / onely for ye ſeruyce of god. The due place of that ſeruyce is the chirche / vnto all them that may cōuenyently come thervnto. And vnto them that may not / euery honeſt place of good & lawfull occupacyon is theyr chyrche. For god is there preſent where he is duely & deuoutly ſerued. Take ye peyne therfore whā you may to go forth your ſelfe / & call your folkes to folowe. And whan you ben at the chirche / do nothynge els but that you came for / and loke oft tymes vpon thē that ben vnder your charge / that all they be occupyed / lyke (at the leeſt) vnto deuoute chryſtyans. For ye chirche (as our ſauyour ſaythe) is a place of prayer / not of claterynge & talkynge.Math. xxj. And charge them alſo to kepe theyr ſyght in the chirche cloce vpon theyr bokes or bedes. And whyle they ben yōge / let them vſe euer to knele / ſtande / or ſyt / and neuer to walke in ye chirche And let them here ye maſſe quyetly & deuoutly / moche parte knelynge. But at the goſpell / at the preface / & at the Pat noſter. teche them to ſtande / & to make curtſy

at this worde Ieſus as the preeſt dothe. Thus in the forenoone let the tyme be ſpente all in ye ſeruyce of god And than in the after noone / muſt you appoynt them theyr paſtyme with great diligence and ſtrayt commaundement. Fyrſt that in no wyſe they vſe ſuche vanytees as cōmunly ben vſed / that is to ſaye / berebayting & bulbaytyng / foteball / teneſplayeng / bowlyng / nor theſe vnlawfull games of cardynge / dycynge / cloſſhynge / with ſuche other vnthryfty paſtymes / or rather loſetymes. Wherin (for a ſuerte) ye holy day may rather be broken / than yf they wente to the plough or carte vpon eeſter day / ſo it were not done by cōtempte or deſpyſynge of ye cōmaundement of the lawe / ne for vnreaſonable couetyſe & loue of worldly goodes. For ſynne dothe alway more defoule & breke the holy day than doth any bodyly werke or occupacyon. Therfore let them beware of the tauerne and alehous / for drede of dronkennes / or of glotony / and of ſuſpecte places / or wanton company / for fere of vnclennes / or lechery whiche thynges ben vnto youth mooſt peryllous / & of great daunger & ieopardy of corrupcyon. Aſſygne you therfore and appoynt you them ye maner of theyr dyſportes / honeſt euer & lawfull for a reaſonable recreacyon / and (as moche as conuenyently may be) let the ſexes be departed in all theyr dyſportes / that is to ſay the kyndes / men by them ſelfe / & the women by them ſelfe. And alſo appoynt the tyme or ſpace / that they be not (for any dyſportes) from ye ſeruyce of god. Appoȳt them alſo ye place / that you may call or ſende for them whan caſe requyreth. For yf there be a ſermon any tyme of the day / let them be there preſent all yt ben not occupyed in nedeful & lawful buſynes / all other layde

on parte / let them euer kepe the prechynges / rather than the maſſe / yf (by caſe) they may not here bothe. To bye and ſell or bargayne vpon the holy daye / is vnlawfull / excepte it be for very nede. Charyte vnto the poore and nedy neyghbours / doth lawfully excuſe bodyly or worldly laboures vpon ye holy daye. Loke wel you neyther do ne ſaye wylfully and by delyberacyon vpon the holy daye any thynge that you knowe in cō
                  ſcience / ſhulde be cōtrary vnto the honour of god / and thā done you iuſtly kepe your holy daye. A very good ſure paſtyme vpon the holy daye / is to rede / or to here this boke / or ſuche other good englyſſhe bookes / and gader thervnto as many perſones as you can. For I tell you there ſhulde be no tyme loſt / ne myſſpent vpon the holy daye. Let this poore leſſon now content you for theſe thre commaundementes of the fyrſte table / whiche (as I ſayd) done apperteyne and belonge vnto almyghty god hymſelfe. Another ſhorte leſſon ſhall we ſet forth / for the commaundementes of the ſecūde table.The .iiij. precepte. And fyrſt the due reuerēde honour to be done of the chylder vnto ye parētes / that is to ſaye / vnto theyr fathers and mothers. Teche your chylder therfore to axe bleſſynge euery nyght / knelynge before they go to reſt / vnder this fourme. Father I beſeche you of bleſſynge for charite / or thus. Mother I beſeche you of charite gyue me your bleſſynge. Thā let the father or mother holde vp bothe the handes / & ioynynge them bothe togyder / loke vp reuerently & deuoutly vnto the heuen / & ſaye thus. Our lorde god bleſſe you chylde / & therwith make a croſſe with the ryght hande ouer ye chylde / ſayenge. In noīe pr̄is et filij et ſpūs ſctī. Amē. And yf any chylde be ſtyffe herted / ſtubburne / and frowarde

/ & wyll not thus axe bleſſynge / yf it be within age / let it ſurely be whyſked with a good rodde / & be compelled thervnto by force. And yf the perſones be of forther age / and paſt ſuche correccyon / and yet wyl be obſtynate / let them haue ſuche ſharpe & greuous punyſſhment as conuenyently may be deuyſed / as to ſyt at dyner alone & by them ſelfe at a ſtole in ye myddle of the hall / with onely browne breed & water / and euery perſone by ordre / to rebuke them as they wold rebuke a theſe or a traytour.Deuter. xxj. d. For in ye olde lawe ſuche chylder were brought before ye hole townſhyp / that is to ſaye the people of ye cyte / or of that towne / and there were they ſtoned vnto dethe. And certeynly I wolde not aduyſe ne coūſeyle any parentes / to kepe ſuche a chylde in theyr hous / wtout great afflyccyon & punyſſhment. And therfore I thynke it were moche cōuenient for ye parētes / oft tymes to ſhewe vnto theyr chylder what cōmodytees & profites / & what perylles & ieopardyes done folowe the honour & dyſhonour of the parētes / accordynge vnto holy ſcrypture.
                     Eccliaſtici. iiij. A. Some wherof I haue here ſet forth as is cōteyned in ye boke of the wyſe mā called Eccleſiaſticus / in ye thyrde chapytre. Thoſe perſones (ſayth he) that ben ye chylder of Chryſt / ben alſo the chylder of this chirche / and al ſuche (as though it were by naturall dyſpoſicyon) ben gyuē and applyed of that godly diſpoſicyon vnto obedyence and loue. All you therfore that ben louȳge chylder / be euer obedient vnto the iudgment & dyſcrecion of your parētes. And ſo be you obedient in all your werkes / that you therby may be ye chylder of ſaluacion / yt is to ſay / yt your obedience be done wt ye very loue of your hert / vnſayned & wtout diſſimulacyō. For god hath ordeyned yt ye father

ſhall haue due honour amonge his chylder / & the mother in lyke maner with lowly obedyence. Thoſe perſones that done loue god / wyl praye vnto hym for the forgyuenes of theyr ſȳnes / & afterward wyll beware conteyne & kepe them ſelfe frō them. And ī that dayly prayer they ſhall gracyouſly be herde. And lyke as a perſone (for the ſurete of his lyuynge here) doth horde vp & gather treſour / ſo done they ordeyn for the ſuerte of theyr ſaluacyon / that duely done honour theyr parentes. This worde parentes doth ſignifye bothe the father and mother. Who ſo euer dothe duely honour his parentes / ſhall haue ioye / pleaſure / and conforte amonge his owne chylder. And who ſo euer is duely obedyent vnto the father / dothe therby refreſſhe and moche cōforte the mother. And theſe ꝑſones that done due honour vnto theyr parentes / ſhall haue longe lyfe and in the day of theyr prayer they ſhal gracyouſly be herde of our lorde / & haue theyr peticyon. Thoſe perſones that haue a reuerende drede vnto our lorde god / haue in lyke maner a reuerende drede vnto theyr parentes / & done duely honour them / and wyll do them ſuche ſeruyce / and in lyke maner as a bonde ſeruaunt ſhulde do vnto his lorde & mayſter / as well in werke as worde / with all pacyence and gentylnes. Do therfore vnto your parentes honoure & reuerēce / that the bleſſyng of god may therby lyght vpon you / and that bleſſynge ſhall remayne & endure vnto your laſt ende. The bleſſynge of the parentes dothe fyrme and make ſtable the poſſeſſyons and the kynred of the chylder. And cōtrary / the curſſe of the parētes doth eradicate and rote walt & vtterly deſtroye bothe. Chylde / neuer take thou pleaſure ne pryde in the rebuke & dyſprayſe

of thy parētes. For that rebuke is not thy glory / booſt nor prayſe / but rather thy cōfuſyon / ſhame & rebuke. For the glory and prayſe of euery perſone / ſtandeth in the honour of the parentes. And a great ſhame & rebuke is it vnto the chylder / whan the parentes ben without honour & reuerence. Good chylder / take good pacyence with the age of your parentes / & neuer diſpleaſe ne greue them in al your lyfe. Ane they fayle in wytte or vnderſtandynge / & therafter ſpeke or do any thynge contrary vnto your reaſon or wytte / take you pacyence with them / & let the mater paſſe. And in no wyſe do not you deſpyſe them / bycauſe of our owne ſtrength or better abilite. For the pite and compaſſion that you haue vnto your parentes / ſhall neuer be forgoten before god. For you ſhall haue good and profyte of theyr offence and ſynne. And in ye iuſtyce and ryght you do vnto them / ſhal you be edifyed / and encreace in vertue. And in ye tyme of your trybulacyon / that good dede ſhalbe remembred. For as ye yce in the froſt dothe melte by the clere ſonne beames / ſo ſhall your ſynnes (by your duety done vnto your parentes) be waſted & clene loſed & forgyuen. That perſone is of euyll name and fame / that doth forſake the parētes in theyr nede And thoſe chylder bē accurſed of god / that done anger vexe and trouble theyr parētes. Chylde of what ſtate or degre ſo euer thou be / do euer thy duty with myldnes / mekenes / and lowlynes / and than ſhalte thou be well byloued / and prayſed aboue other perſones. And the more hyghe eſtate thou come vnto / the more meke and lowly be thou in all thynges / and than ſhalt thou in the preſence of god haue great meryte / & encreaſe in grace. For god dothe loke vpon them that done rendre

and gyue due thankes / for the fauour & goodnes done vnto them before.Ad verbū ferme trāſlata. All this now is ye very text & lettre of ye holy ſcrypture in ye place before reherſed. Where you may ſe and perceyue many great cōmodytes and graces that done come vnto them that duely done honour theyr parētes. And many great ieopardyes and peryls / and alſo the curſe of god / that doth lyght vpon them that wyll not do theyr duety of honour and reuerence vnto theyr parentes. Let therfore your chylder vſe and accuſtom thē ſelfe / dayly to axe theyr fathers and mothers bleſſynges. For this dare I ſay / that all though in caſe / the father or mother were an abhomynable ſȳner / or excōmunicate / accurſed / or an heretike and though ye chylde were ſo alſo.ex grego. li. dialog. iij. ca. vij. Yet myght yt croſſe of the bleſſynge of that father or mother ſaue yt chylde from ſodeyn myſchefe / that els myght haue come vnto that chylde. And yt croſſe maye alſo do flee or chace away euyl ſpyrytes / that els ſhulde haue had power vpon that chylde. The bleſſyng of euery good perſone is good / and not without great vertue / accordyng vnto the power and degree of the perſones / and therfore teche them alſo to axe bleſſynge of euery byſſhop / abbot / & euery preeſt / and of theyr godfathers & godmothers / with other deuoute perſones.The fyft precepte. And let this ſuſfyſe for this fourth cōmaundement. ¶Yet go forther vnto the fyfth cōmaūdement / whiche is / to kyll or ſlee no perſone. Teche them there / that it is not ynough ye they put no ꝑſone to deth by ſtroke of hande or wepen / but alſo that they hurte no ꝑſone in name or fame by detraccyon / backbytynge or ſclaundrynge / or by euyll exemple of lyuynge / nor yet that they curſe or ban / or wyſſhe euyl vnto any perſone / or yet hate any perſone

in hert.j. Iohis iij. c. For (as ſcripture ſayth) who ſo euer doth here in herte or mynde any hatered / malyce / euyll wyll / or ſtomacke agaynſt any chryſtian / is an homicide / that is a manſleer or a manqueller. Many perſones wyll ſay they ben in charite / and haue no hatered vnto any perſone / and yet wyll they not ſpeke one vnto another and as it is a ſygne and token that preuy hatered is in the herte / and that they do not loue theyr neyghbour as them ſelfe / in the true and vnfayned charyte of our lorde.j. Iohā. iiij. d. And ſure it is / that who ſo euer doth not hooly & fully loue his neyghbour / whome he may ſe & beholde with his bodyly ſyght / he can neuer loue god / whome he can not ſe / nor ſo beholde. This is than the cōmaū
                  dement of god / that who ſo euer dothe loue god / muſt alſo loue his neyghbour.The .vj. precepte. ¶The .vj. cōmaūdement is that no lechery be done / whiche is not ment onely for the vnlawfull dede / but alſo for all maner of prouocacyon ther vnto / as wanton and lyght behauyours / in kyſſynge / clepynge / & vnclene touchynge / a lyght loke or caſt of the ſyght / with a deſyre and conſent of herte vnto the dede / dothe breke this cōmaūdement. Moche more thā doth rybauldy breke it / and ſuche maner as before is ſayd. The olde prouerbe ſayth. Who ſo wyll none euyll do / ſhulde do nothynge that longeth therto. The ghoſtli enemy doth deceyue many perſones by ye pretēce and colour of matrimony / in pryuate & ſecrete contractes.Contractes. For many men whan they can not obteyn theyr vnclene deſyre of the woman / wyll promyſe mariage / & thervpon make a contracte / promyſe / & gyue fayth & trouth eche vnto other / ſayenge. Here I take the margery vnto my wyfe / & therto plyght the my trouth. And ſhe agayne vnto hym in lyke maner. And

after that done / they ſuppoſe they may lawfully vſe theyr vnclene behauyour / and ſomtyme the acte and dede doth folowe / vnto the great offence of god & theyr owne ſoules. It is a great ieopardy therfore to make any ſuche contractes / ſpecyally amonge them ſelfe ſecretely alone / without recordes / whiche muſt be two at the leeſt. For many tymes / after the vnlawful pleaſure is paſt / diſcorde dothe fall bytwene the partyes / eyther bycauſe that (as the cōmune prouerbe ſaythe) hote loue is ſoone colde / or els by the meanes of theyr frendes / or by ſome couetyſe to haue a better mariage they or one of them done denye the cōtracte / and ſo vnlawfully doone mary otherwyſe / & lyue in aduoutry all theyr lyfe tyme. And bycauſe the chirche can not openly knowe that thynge that was ſpoken and done in priuyte / they bē thought and ſuppoſed ſo to lyue as lawfully in mariage / where in dede before god they done lyue as noughty packes in dampnable aduoutri and vnlawfull lechery / & all theyr chylder baſtardes before god / all though they ſeme otherwyſe vnto the worlde. Warne therfore your folkes there be no ſuche blȳde bargaynes in your hous or gouernaūce. ¶The vij. cōmaūdemēt is / do no thefte.The .vij. precepte. Herein correcte your yonge perſones be tyme. For ye chylde that begynneth to pyke at a pyn or a poynt / wyll after pyke a peny or a poūde. And ſo go forth from an apple vnto an oxe / & from a peer to a purſe / or an hors / and ſo from ye ſmall thynges vnto the great. Whan you take any chylde therfore with the maner / be it neuer ſo lytel a thynge / paye truly at the firſt tyme / & the ſecūde tyme / prycke the pȳnes or the poyntes vpon the cappe or ſhulder in open ſyght / and let all the houſe wonder vpon them / &

crye all / here is the theſe / this is ye thefe / ſeſe ye thefe. And yf they mende not therby / let them be ſo brought through the open ſtretes with ſhame ynough / & cruel punyſſhment. For better is it that the chylde wepe in youth / and ſuffre ſhame and rebuke / than hereafter the father / mother and frēdes ſhulde wepe for ſorowe and ſhame at his hangynge and ſhamfull dethe. And let euery ꝑſone beware of thefte. For all other ſynnes with contricyon / confeſſyon and penaūce / may be forgyuen clerely / but thefte and all goodes valawfully goten / can neuer be forgyuen vnto the tyme that reſtitucyon be made / that is to ſaye / vnto the tyme thoſe goodes / or the valure of them be reſtored / yf the perſones (in any wyſe) may be able thervnto. Let euery perſone than ponder well and wey / what vauntage it is to ſtele or pyke / ſythe (beſyde the peyne certeynly to be fuffred in hell or purgatory) the ſame goodes (in valure) muſt be reſtored agayne. Small goodes truly goten / done growe and encreae vnto the great conforte of the perſones. And cōtrary / euyl goten goodes lyghtly come (as they ſaye) and lyghtly go / all waſte vnto nought / with the dyſcōforte of the partyes / and greate combraunce of conſcyence. Se than that all goodes be well goten amonge you.

For though ſuche thynges may ſeme vnto the worlde lawfull / ſurely they be not without the greate offence of god / as contrary vnto his commaundementes. And thus an ende of the .x. cōmaundementes. ¶Yet muſt you haue a leſſon to teche your folkes to beware of the ſeuen pryncypall ſynnes / whiche ben cōmunly called the .vij. deedly ſynnes / but in dede they done call them wronge / for they ben not alway deedly ſynnes.Of ye .vij. prīcypall ſynnes.

Fyrſt good deuoute chriſtians I beſeche you gyue no credence vnto theſe falſe heretykes / that done depraue & ſet nought by cōfeſſion / nor by this holy ſacramēt of penaūce For I acerteyn you thoſe perſones whatſoeuer they be / that (after theyr baptiſme and chryſtendom) haue done any deedly ſynne / can neuer be in the ſtate of ſaluacyon without the feyth and wyll of cōfeſſion.Geneſ. iij For almyghty god in euery lawe dyd requyre cōfeſſyon / and prouoke euery treſpacer thervnto / as of our fyrſt parentes Adam and Eue in paradyſe

/ which cōfeſſion yf they had mekely made / they and all we ſholde haue ſuffred the leſſe peyne.Leuiti. iiij. et. v. In the olde lawe ſpeciall oblacions & ſacryfyce was appoynted openly by the preeſtes to be done for ſuche ſynnes amonge the people that were preuy & vnknowen vnto al other perſones / excepte onely the ſelfe treſpacers Wherby it muſt nedes be trouthe / that they were confeſſed therof vnto the preeſtes. Whā any perſone alſo was ſuſpecte of lepry / the iudgment and determynacyon therof remayned (by the ordinaunce of the lawe) vnto the preeſt. Whiche thynge was a playne fygure of the ſacrament of penaunce and confeſſyon.Math. v. And our ſauyour ſayd / he come not to breke ye lawe / but rather to accomplyſſhe & fulfyll the lawe.Mat. viij Luc. xvij And ſo he dyd confyrme and ratifye that lawe / whan he ſent the lepres that he cured & heeled vnto the preeſtes. And in euery cure he dyd vpon ye ſycke perſones / he expreſſed myſtecally confeſſion / in that he cauſed them to ſhewe theyr dyſeaſe before they were cured.Act. v. And ſaynt Peter his vycar after his aſcencyon / dyd requyre confeſſion of a mā called Ananye / & of his wyfe called Saphirye (as appereth in holy ſcrypture) of a deedly ſynne / whiche he (by the reuelacyon of god) knewe they had done / & bycauſe they wolde not make confeſſyon therof / they were bothe ſtryken to deth with the vēgeaūce of god. Our mother holy chirche therfore hath (by the inſpiracion of ye holy ghoſt (ordeyned that euery perſone ye doth cōmyt or do any deedly ſȳne in werke / worde / or by full deliberate conſent in thought / muſt nedely (yf they wyll be ſaued) be confeſſed therof vnto a preeſt. Syth than all chriſten people haue receyued and vſed the ſame ſo many hondred yeres / take you that vſe

and cuſtome for ſufficyent auctorite to folowe ye ſame and to put all maner of contrary opynyon clene out of mynde / and in no wyſe to here ſpeke or talke therof. Now vnto our mater. Fyrſt teche your folkes to come reuerently vnto the ghoſtly father with meke & ſobre countenaūce and behauyour (For it is no laughynge game) Than knele downe at ye place appoynted / and there make a croſſe vpon the foreheed or fronte / with Innomine patris (as before is ſhewed) and thē forth with ſay thus. Benedicite. And whan the preeſt hath anſwered / than ſaye (yf the perſon be lerned) Confiteor deo / beate marie / omnibus ſanctis / et vobis: peccaui nimis / cogitatione / locutione / & opere mea culpa. That is to ſay for the vnlerned / I cōfeſſe & knowlege my ſelfe gylty vnto our lord god / ye bleſſed lady ſaynt Marye / vnto all the holy company of heuē / and vnto you my ghoſtly father / that I haue offended my lorde god many tymes in my lyfe / and ſpecyally ſyth ye laſt tyme of my confeſſyon / in thought / worde / and dede / in many and dyuers wayes / moo than I can ſhewe / ſpecially in the .vij. prȳcyyall ſynnes. Pryde / enuye & wrath / couetyſe / glotony / ſlouth and lechery. And by them I haue broken his cōmaundementes.
            
            
               ¶Pryde.
               ¶For by ye ſynne of pryde I haue ben preſumptuous and diſobediēt vnto god / & haue not loued hym aboue all thynges / but many tymes ſet more by myne owne frayle appetyte & ſenſuall deſyre. For where I ſhulde haue deſyred euer ye laude & prayſe of our lorde / & wt all mekenes of herte accuſed myſelfe / I haue cōtrary boſted myſelfe / or deſyred & bē glad of myn owne prayſe and ben loth to be dyſprayſed. And whan I haue ben

chalenged / reproued / rebuked or corrected / or yet charytably ben monyſſhed & warned of / & for my defautes / I haue rebelled there agaynſt / & not mekely receyued it / but rather ben redy to defend or to excuſe my ſelf / & ſomtyme wt a lye / or a falſe othe. And for lacke of reuerende drede & loue of our lord / I haue by preſumpcion of pryde taken his holy name in vayne / & vnlawfully ſworne by god / by our lady / or the holy ſayntes / by my feyth or trouth / wt ſuche other. And for very pryde & preſumpcyon / & for lacke alſo of loue & drede / I haue myſvſed ye holy daye in thynges of pleaſure / or ꝓfyte vnto my ſelfe / & not in his ſeruyce vnto his honour. I haue alſo (of hygh & proude herte or mynde) ben diſobedient & not done due honour & reuerence vnto my fathers and mothers ſpiritual & carnall / ghoſtly & bodyly / nor vnto myn elders & betters / but haue ben many tymes full obſtynate & frowarde vnto thē. I crye god mercy. Thus (by this foule ſynne of pryde) I haue broken foure of the prȳcypal cōmaūdemētes of our lorde / and many other wayes haue I alſo offended therin. I beſeche his grace of mercy and forgyuenes.
            
            
               ¶Enuye.
               ¶I haue alſo offended my lorde god in ye ſȳne of enuy for I haue not loued my neyghbour as myſelf / nor bē ſo charitably / ſo kȳde / ſo louynge & fauorable vnto all ꝑſones / as I wolde they ſhulde haue bē to me / but rather I haue (by ſuſpicion) thought / iudged / ſayd or herde of other ꝑſones / otherwyſe than I wolde they ſhulde of me nor ben ſo glad of theyr welth / ne ſo ſory for theyr hurte as I wolde haue ben of myne owne. I crye god mercy.
            
            
               ¶Wrathe.
               ¶In wrath alſo I haue offended / for lacke of due pacyence

/ and for lyght / ſleyght / or ſmall occaſyon / haue lyghtly and ſoone ben ſtyred and moued / wrothe and angry / whan any thynge hathe ben done or ſayd contrary vnto my mynde. And therwith haue ben redy to reuenge the ſame with forwarde & vengeable countenaunce and behauyour / with hygh / haſty / and vngoodly wordes / brawlynge / chydyng / ſcoldyng / reuylynge / rebukynge / raylyng / vpbraydyng / threthyng / curſynge / bannynge / ſwerynge. And yf it came thervnto / in ſtryuynge / fyghtynge / or (at the leeſt in wyll) (as god forbede) in kyllyng or ſleynge. Thus by theſe two great ſynnes of enuy and wrathe I haue broken the fyfth and the .viij. commaundement of our lorde / and by many other meanes offended in them bothe. I beſeche his grace of mercy and forgyuenes.
            
            
               ¶Couetyſe.
               ¶In couetyſe alſo I haue ſynned / bycauſe I haue not ben content with the goodes / ſtate / & degre of lyuynge that god hath ſent me / where it is moche better than I haue deſerued / or am worthy / but I haue coueyted & deſyred / wyſſhed & wylled / ſtudyed and laboured to haue more (yf any be vnlawfully gotē or ſo withholden / make playne confeſſyon therof as ye mater requyreth) Thus by this ſȳne of couetyſe haue I broken the ſeuenth commaundement of our lorde / and alſo the tenth / and otherwyſe dyuerſly offended in couetyſe. I beſeche his grace of mercy and forgyuenes.
            
            
               ¶Glotony.
               ¶I haue alſo ſynned in glotony / in takyng meet and drȳke vndiſcretely / & aboue that nature dyd requyre / and haue pyked out and choſen (ſomtyme by ſenſuall appetyte) the delycate / ſwete / and pleaſaunt meetes &

drynkes / rather for pleaſure thā for nede / & takē therof ſuche ſuperfluite (at ſome tymes) that I haue ben therby ſycke or diſeaſed / or at the leeſt ben ye more dull bothe in body & ſoule / vnto all maner of vertue & good exercyſes (Loke here whether you haue broken any faſtes cōmaunded by the lawe / or ben dronke / or take any notable ſurfet) after meer cōmunely I haue ben more redy to paſſe the tyme in bodyly dyſportes and ydlenes / than in labours. I crye god mercy.
            
            
               ¶Slouth.
               ¶I haue ben alſo moche ſlouthfull and neglygent to ſerue god / bothe vpon ye holy day & other dayes alſo / & I haue ben yrke wery / & thought the tyme of prayer longe / come late thervnto / & make haſt therin / & oues paſſed the ſeruyce of god / wtout due reuerēce / more by courſe & cuſtome / than by any good remēbraūce or deuocyon / & alſo I haue not ben diligēt to apply my ſelfe vnto ſuche bodily labours as I haue had in charge / & ſomtyme haue not done the labours at all / or elles full ſleyghtly done them / & ſpēt ye tyme after myne owne appetyte full vnfruytfully / ſomtyme in wantōneſſe / & ſomtyme in very ydlenes. I crye god mercy.
            
            
               ¶Lechery.
               ¶By ye meanes of theſe two foule ſynnes of glotony and ſlouth / I haue ben the more redy vnto the thyrde ſȳne of ye fleſſhe / that is to ſay / lechery / for I haue not ben ſo chaſt in ſoule & body / as ye ſtate / degre & maner of my lyuyng doth requyre / not ſo diligēt & redy to put away vnclene thoughtes or mocyons of ye body as I ſhuld be / but rather folowed them at ſomtymes wyl fully / & ſuffred them to hange vpon me / and take in them delectacyon & pleaſure for the tyme. And whan

I haue bē in preſence of company / I haue not alway ordered my ſelfe in chaſt maner / in my lokes or ſyghtes / countenaūce and behauyour / wordes and dedes / but many tymes haue ben fullyght to take or to gyue occaſyon. I crye god mercy. Here muſt you remembre ſute or prouocacyon vnto vnclenneſſe / done or ſuffred on your behalfe / as in wordes / wrytynges / ſygnes / tokens / meſſages / kyſſynge / clepynge / touchynge / or other more fylthy ayd vnlawfull behauyour / done in dede or in full cōſente. And ſo ſhewe euery thȳge with the due circūſtaunces / of ye tyme / place / and perſones / not namynge the perſones / but ſhewynge the ſtates or degrees of them / as whether they be maryed or vnmaried &c̄. Thus by this foule ſynne of lechery / haue I broken the .vi. and alſo the .ix. commaundement of god / & by many other meanes / as well in this ſynne as in all the other of theſe .viij. princypall ſȳnes / haue I greuouſly offended my lorde god / broken his commaundementes / not fulfylled the werkes of mercy vnto my power / and myſvſed my fyue wyttes / in herynge / ſeynge / ſmellynge / taſtynge / and touchynge. For the whiche and for al other / as our lorde knoweth me gylty / and I wolde confeſſe and knowlege yf they came to mynde / I beſeche his gracyous goodnes of mercy and forgyuenes. And you my ghoſtly father of penaunce and abſolucyon. Et precor ſanctā mariam / omnes ſanctos dei / et vos orare pro me. Whiche is to meane vnto the vnlerned. And I beſeche the bleſſed lady ſaynt Marye / all the holy company of heuen / and you alſo my ghoſtly father to praye for me. And whan you haue taken your penaunce / and haue ben aſſoyled / than ſaye you vnto the preeſt. Syr / and it

pleaſe you / this is my penaunce / and than reherſe the ſame ones or twyſe your ſelfe / that you may the more ſurely here it in mynde. For I aſſure you / it is ieoperdous (after lerned men) to forgete the penaunce. And thus an ende hereof. ¶Yet dyd I promyſe in the begynnynge / to ſet forth here a forther exercyſe / whiche I thynke ſhuld be good and profitable for al perſones For the cōmune prouerbe is / that a great benefyte or gyfte is worſe than loſt vpon ſuche vnkȳde perſones that done not remembre it / ne gyue but thankes therfore. It ſhuld become therfore euery feythful chriſtian to haue euer in mynde the great and excellent benefite of our ſaluacion. And therefore haue I deuyſed here a ſhorte table / that dothe (in ſome) conteyne the hole lyfe of our ſauyour Ieſu / that ſuche perſones as wyll can it by herte / & haue it redy in mȳde / may lyghtly ordre & laye vp as it were treſour in a cheſt or cofre / al ſuche maters of the goſpell / & that done apperteyne vnto ye actes of our ſauyour / as ben preched where they ben preſent / or that they done here in any good cōmunycacyon or redynges. And alſo ouer this / they ſhall haue two great ꝓfytes hereby / one is / yt no remedy maye better ne ſooner chace awaye all tentacyons / & put the ghoſtly enemyes to flyght / than this remembraunce. The ſecunde is / that nothynge in this worlde may rather ne more ſpedefully moue a dull herte vnto deuocyon & vnto the cōtynuaunce of vertue / than this exercyſe. I beſeche you all therfore / in viſceribꝰ Ieſu xp̄i. that is to ſay / for the tender loue of oure lorde god and mooſt ſwete ſauyour Ieſu / gyue ſome labour and dilygēce thervnto / & dayly vſe the ſame. It is but ſhorte and therfore may it ſoone be had by herte. And it is very

ſwete / pleaſaūt and profitable / and therfore ſhulde be receyued with good wyll and diligence.

The ſlepe of ye houſbāde:Ariſto. in economie maketh a fatte dong hyll. And the eye of the mayſter: a faſt hors. That is to meane / that ye preſence of the mayſter: in euery corner: is moche profytable. Sumptuous & coſtly weddynges or brydales: ben damage / without honoure. Expences done vpon warre: ben more honorable: thā profytable. Better is to ſuffre ſome wronge / & to bye peace than to make warre / or to kepe warre. Coſte made vpon prodigall perſones: is clerely loſte. Coſte made vpon kȳne / or frēdes: is reaſonable. Fede your houſholde ſeruaūtes: with honeſt cōmune fare / with out delicates. For the ſeruaunt that is made a gloton / ſhall neuer after mende his maners. Glotony is vyle / fylthy / and ſtynkynge / and wyll make the neglygent and careles perſon ſoone rotē and ſhort lyued.Eccleſia. xxxj. Meane fedynge with ſcarcyte: is vnto the dylygent perſon: pleaſaūt and profytable. Vpon the holydayes & hygh feſtes: gyue your houſholde plenty of meet: but ſelden and fewe delicates. For the vſe of delycate fode / wyll ſoone marre a good ſeruaunt. Let glotony & thy purs ſtryue / and go to lawe togyder: & beware thou well / whiche parte thou takeſt / but for ye moſt parte alway holde with the purs. For glotonous men of lawe and the wytneſers: done ſpeke all of affection / but ye purs bryngeth in playne euydēce & profe / the empty barne and the empty bagge. But yf very nygardy ſhutte vp thy purs / thā art not thou an euē iudge. For nygardy is a folyſſhe and nedeles feere / and euer lyuynge in pouerte / and hurdeth and muckereth vp: he can not tell for whome. Yf you haue plēty of corne: deſyre no derth For thoſe perſones that of couetous mynde done procure or deſyre derthe / done procure and deſyre ye dethe

of the pore / and ſhalbe accuſed: as homicides and mā ſleers. Sell thy corne better chepe vnto thy neyghbur (although he were thyn enemy) thā vnto ſtraūgers. For an enemy is ſomtyme ſoner vainquyſſhed & ouer comen by a kynde dede / than by the ſwerde. Be neuer at debate with thy neyghbur / but rather ſtudy / and labour to be at one.
                     Eccl. ſ. b. For thou canſt haue none ſo ſure a caſtel / or garde of thy lyfe: as is loue and frendſhyp of thy neyghburs: Yf yu ſuſpecte the womē of thy houſe: let other perſones rather ſhewe the / than thou ſhulde be ouer buſy to try out the mater. For though it were of thyn owne wyfe / or the wyfe of thy huſbande: it were better vnknowen. For ones knowen / it is neuer cured / the wounde is without remedy / Yf any remedy be: it ſhalbe whan lyke chaunce is herde of other perſones. The leſt & moſt eaſy waye therin: is to diſſimule the mater though it were pryuely knowen / and pretende ygnoraunce without any quarell or countenaunce / but rather by a dyſcrete ghoſtly father let the partyes be reformed that ſynne be not cōtynued. A noble herte / and hygh gentyll mynde: wyll neuer ſerche of womens maters. A ſhrewe wyll ſoner be corrected by ſmylynge or laughȳge: than by a ſtaffe / or ſtrokes. The beſt way to kepe a woman good: is gentle intreaty / and neuer to let her knowe that ſhe is ſuſpected / and euer to be coūſeyled & informed with louynge maner. An olde woman vnclene of lyuynge (yf the lawe wolde ſuffre) ſhulde be buryed quycke.Of aray. Let your clothȳge or aray / be in a meane / nother vyle ne precious / but alway feyre and honeſt / and of ſad / & not of wanton faſſhyon. A coſtly garment byhonde: or aboue the ſtate and degre of the perſon: is a ſygne and token of

lytle wytte. For a woman that hath ſufficient aray: to deſyre newe / and chaūge: is a ſygne of lytle ſadnes. Truſt hym rather for thy frende / that ſomwhat doth for the: than hym that dothe offre hym ſelfe: ſaynge. I am youres in all I can and may. For in wordes is great plente of frendes.Prouer. xvij. c. Eccl. ſ. b. A true frende loueth at all tymes / and neuer feyleth: at nedr. There is no comparyſon of ryches: vnto a feythfull frende. Neuer repute / ne thynke hym thy frende: that dothe prayſe / or boſte the vnto thy face / or in thy preſence. Whan you gyue counſeyle vnto a frende: ſay this ſemeth beſt vnto me / not thus you muſt nedeli do. For you may ſoner get rebuke / or blame for your coūſel yf it ꝓue not: thā thāke for your good coūſel: though it ſpede well. Yf mȳſtrelles / iogulers / or geſters come vnto thy houſe: ſay thou haſt no lodgȳg for ſuche geſters / you kepe nether ynne nor aleſtake. For if you take pleaſure ī theyr paſtymes you ben full lyke to haue another wyfe ſhortly after / whoſe name is called pouerte / or beggry. Yf you fortune to come where they ben / & begyn ſomwhat to delecte in theyr maters: I aduyſe you diſſimule & take vpon you yt you herde thē not / ne ſet any thynge therby. For yf they perceyue & ſe you but laugh: they wyll take yt for an erneſt to cry largeſſe / & to haue rewarde. And ſo importune wyll they be / & ſo ſhamfully craue: yt you ſhalbe yrke & wery of thē / & ꝑauēture they wyll fall to rebukȳge / braulyng / & ſcoldyng / ſo yt you ſhalbe fayne / & glad: to gyue ſomwhat for fere vnto thoſe galowe clapers worthy in dede to be hanged vp. For I tel you / god is not pleaſed wt yt occupacyon / except it be (as ſcant tolerable or alowable) amōg prȳces / lordes / & hygh aſtates Now for your ſeruaūtes / if you haue a

ſeruaunt of hygh proude mynde & ſtubburne ſtomake put hym awaye leſt after he do you harme / and ſo do hym yt alwaye dothe prayſe your maners in all thynges. For a flaterer is worſe than an enemy. Your enemy can not lyghtly deceyue you / but your ſeruaūtes or your neyghbours that done prayſe you: ben ſurely about to deceyue you. Yf you haue a baſhful & dredful ſeruaūt & fynde hȳ feythful / thā loue hym & cheryſſhe hym as your owne naturall chylde. Make your byldynges rather for nede than for pleaſure. For the appetyte of byldynge for pleaſure ſhall neuer haue ende / tyll pouerte teche wytte ſomwhat to late. Be lothe to ſell your heritage / and yf you muſt nede / ſell. Sell not vnto great perſones / but rather for leſſe vnto ye lower perſones. Better is to ſell thā to borowe by vſury. For vſury is lyke a thefe yt wolde warne you before what harme he wolde do vnto you. Yf you bye or bargayne / be not buty felowe with great perſones. And though he be vnder you / yet ſtryue not with hym leſt he putte his parte vnto your better / or mayſter. In all thȳges kepe truly and feythfully your bonde and promyſe / accordynge vnto your couenaunte. Due temperaūce is a thynge of great honeſtye in a houſholde / let therfore your drynke wyne / ale / or bere be temperate. Strōge drynke is more pleaſaunt / than holſome.Eccleſia. xxxj. d. Ibidem. The wyſe man ſaythe / that ſobre drynke is the helthe bothe of ſoule & body. And the wyſe and lerned perſone wyl be ryght well content with lytle drynke / and that ſhall not trouble the ſtomake / but rather cauſe ſwete & holſome ſlepe / and of the contrarye done come many incō
                  modites as there doth folowe. Who ſo euer amonge many and dyuers ſtronge drynkes / with abundaūce

therof: is ſobre / may be called an erthly god / or a god vpon erthe / wraſtle not therwith yf you do my coūſel. And yf by chaunce you be in company / & begyn to fele the drynke worke: aryſe / and departe / a ſlepe is more meite for you / than any company. Who ſo by wordes wolde excuſe drōkenes: dothe opēly declare his owne dyſeaſe. The knowlege and iudgment of wynes: doth nothynge become a yonge ꝑſon. Yf a phyſicyon or ſurgyon vſe to be dronke / let hym not haue ye cure of your dyſeaſe / ne let none of them take experyence / and lerne in you: how to cure / or hele another. For thoughe they be well lerned / and haue not experyence / it is no wyſdome to let them proue theyr conyng vpon you. Great gay horſes / and lytle prety dogges: leue you vnto lordes and ladyes. A bygge labourynge hors / and a maſtyfe / or a curre dogge: ben good to kepe your houſe. As for haukes / houndes / and huntynge dogges: done ſpende more than they done get / they ben miete & accordynge for ſtates: to ſet ydle ſeruauntes on werke / but ferre vnacordynge ben they: for houſbandes and ware houſholders. It is no wyſdome to make your owne chylder ſtewardes or rulers of your houſholde or goodes. Fooles and neglygent or careles perſones: haue many myſfortunes. For that is theyr commune excuſe whan any thynge is wronge / they ſay than: yt chaunce or myſfortune was cauſe therof. I ſay not nay: but yt chaunce / or myſfortune may fall. But who ſo dothe folowe wyſdome / lernynge / and dyſcrecyon: ſhall ſeldom accuſe myſfortune. For diligence / warenes / and good hede: done ſeldom company with myſfortune. But yet more ſeldom ſhall you ſe myſfortune and ſlouthe or neglygence: departed in ſondre / for they

done communely company togeder. The ſluggarde ſayth: god wyll helpe hym / & ſo tonge he truſteth ther vnto:Pro. vi. tyll he be brouhht vnto beggry. For god by the wyſe man doth ſende the ſluggarde (for exemple) vnto ye ant or pyſinpre / to lerne to labour. For mā (ſaythe Iob) is borne vnto labour:Iob. v. as a byrd to flye. Kepe you (therfore) but fewe ydle perſones or mē. And watche you / & take good hede vnto euery ꝑſone of your houſe. And euer pondre / wey / and conſydre your expenſes: with your gaynes / or gettynges. Fyrſt get / & brynge in / and than ſpende. For it is no good huſbandry to borowe. And whā you wex aged: truſt rather vnto god thā vnto your chylder / or frendes. That you ſende before you: you ſhalbe ſure to fynde. No cofre / chyſt / ne towre may be more ſure to kepe treſure: than is heuē. Let not (therfore) ye poore paſſe you. What you gyue vnto them: you gyue vnto chryſt. And of yt you leue behynde you: appoynt it vnto euery ꝑſon his parte. For better were for you nothynge to leue: than that ſtryfe and debate ſhulde be made / cōſcience blemyſſhed / and god offended for your goodes. Truſt them beſt to do for your ſoule: not that done loue / or ſay they done loue your ſoule: but that you done perceyue / & coniecture: done loue theyr owne ſoule. Make your teſtamēt euery yere newe / & ſurely ſealed by wytnes. Lay it where (whan nede is) it may be founde no man is ſure how to ende his lyfe. The moſt ſure waye: to dye well / is well to lyue. Whiche he graunt vs that bought vs / our lorde god / and moſt ſwete ſauyour Ieſu chryſt. Amē. Of your charite pray for the ſame olde wretche of Syon
