Tent on̄ly therto for to haue clerer sighte & clenner loue of Ihū in whom is all the blessed trynyte.

                  COuetyse also is slayne in a sowle by the worchynge of loue: for it makyth the soule soo coueytous of ghostly gode and to heuenly ryches soo ardaūt that it setteth ryght nough tby all erthly thynges / It hathe noo more deynte in hauyng of a precyous stone thanne a chalke stone / ne more loue hath he in a hundreth pounde of golde thanne in a pounde of

For why the herte of goddis louer is thrugh the yefte of ye holy ghost taken so fully wyth the syghte of the loue of a nother thynge that is Ihū. & that is soo precyous & soo worthy yt it wol receyue none other loue restyngly that is contrary therto / And not on̄ly dooth loue this but also it sleeth the lykyng of lecherye & all other bodily vnclen̄es. and bryngeth in to the soule very chastyte· & torneth it in to likynge / For the soule felyth so grete delyte in the syghte of Ihū that it liketh for to be chaste & is noo grete hardnes to it for to kepe chastite. for it is soo moost ease & moost rest / And vpon the selfe wyse the yefte of loue sleeth lustes of glotenye & makyth the soule sobre & temperaunte. and bereth it vp soo myghtily that it maye not reste in likynge of mete & drynke. but it taketh mete & drynke what it be that leest greueth the bodyly cōplexion yf he maye lyghtly come therto / Not for loue of itself. but for the loue of god / On this maner wyse the louer of god seeth well yt him nedeth for to kepe his bodily lyfe wyth mete & drynke aslong as god woll suffre hem to be togyder / Then̄e shall this be ye discrecōn of the louer of Ihū as I vndstonde that hath feling & worchynge in the loue. that vpon what maner that he may moost kepe his grace hole & leest be letted fro worchynge in it thrugh takynge of bodily sustenaūce: soo shall he doo / That maner of mete that leest letteth & leest troubleth the herte and maye kepe the body in strengthe be it flesshe be it fysshe be it brede & ale: yt I trow the soule cheseth for to hane yf it may come therby / For all the besynes of ye soule is for to thynke on Ihū wyth reuerent loue euer wythoute lettynge of ony thynge yf yt it myghte / And therfore sythen it must nedis sōwhat be letted & hyndred. the lesse that it is letted & hindred by mete or drynke or ony other thynge the leuer it is / It had leuer vse the beste mete & moost of price vnd the son̄e yf it lesse letted ye
