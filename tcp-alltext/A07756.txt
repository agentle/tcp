            Contayning a moste excellent discourse of life and death, vvritten in Frenche by Philip de Mornaye Gentleman.
            And doone into English by E. A.
            
            Imprinted at London by Iohn Allde for Edward Aggas dwelling in Paules Churchyarde at the signe of the red Dragon. 1576.
         
         
            
            
            
               To the right honourable, his singuler good Lady, the moste godly and vertuous Lady, Margaret Countesse of Darby, grace and peace in our Lord Iesus Christe.
            
               
                  NOtwithstandinge that the natural dispo sition (right Honourrable) of all humaine creatures, ought moste sufficiētly to instruct vs in the knovv ledge of our ovvne frailtie, & so consequently inforce vs vnto a continuall and earnest desire of death, vvhich assuredly is no other then a translation and passage of our soules out of this transitorie habitation, into an euerlasting & parmanēt house, exempt from manifolde miseryes and inconueniences, vvherunto this our painfull Pilgrimage is stil subiect, yet for asmuch as the vveakenesse and imperfection of our carnall vnderstanding

is such, as that it cannot comprehend or perceiue the infinite and inestimable benefits, vvhiche at all times through death vve doo obtaine, but rather dooth inforce vs to feare the same as some sharp tempest or greeuous passage. I thought it not amisse to translate out of Fraunce into this our natiue soile of England, this breefe but moste excellent discourse, first vvritten in Frenche by a godly and learned Christian, for the greate comfort of all Christes members: and novv do on into English for the benefit of suche as therin vvill seeke to reape any commoditie, the rehearsall of the contents vvherof by reason of the breuitie of the same, seemeth both needles & superfluous. Neuerthelesse seeking the protection of some honorable personage, vvhose countenance and authoritie might sbeelde and defend asvvel the rudenesse of the translation, as also the raggidnes of the stile therof, from the bitter tants and

            To the Reader.
            
               
                  AS CONCERNING the Argument of this discourse, it tendeth especially to the ouerthrowe of the continuall presumptiō that vve haue to obtain in this life the thing vvhich since the transgression of our forefathers neuer vvas, neither euer shalbe, as is euident in the displaying of man, euen from his beginning to his ending.
            Also as touching this vvoorde Fortune. (vvhiche in diuerse partes of his treatise is incident) I am to desire that it may be taken as an vsuall or ra ther importunate phrase of our language, the vvhich in place of vtter abolishing the same dooth but ouermuch vse it, because that things commonly chauncing contrarie vnto naturall reason, or the common sence of mans vvit, haue in imitating the language of the Heathen, by our auncestors, beene commonly attributed vnto Lady Fortune.
            Finally, in that I haue brought in, in the end the heathen Philosopher Se

                vttering of his minde, I am likevvise to require that it be not taken as an argumente of vvant of other sufficient and auctēticall testimonie of the moste aūcient Christian fathers touching this matter: but rather I vvold haue you to knovve, that I accounted him beeing a straunger, more fit vvith his exclamations, earnestly to vvaken vs out of our drousie nests, for that his knowledge proceeded only of learned & naturall iudgemēt, conioy ned vvith some experience vvhich he had of the vaine frailtie of mans nature, and so to seeme to guide vs into a better Hauen, then him self could euer enter into, or by his ovvne example testifie vnto others.

            Our life resembleth a right Penelopes web, which still must be wouen and wouen again: a Sea habandoned to all windes, which sometime inward ly sometime outwardly tormenteth it: and a troublesome path, through frost and extreme heate: ouer steepie m

And yet when death commeth to finish our labours, when she stretcheth foorth her arme to helpe vs into the Hauen, and when after so many passages and troublesome hostryes, she séeketh to bring vs into our true habitation: into a place of comforte and ioy, where wee should take harte at the viewe of our lande, and drawing towarde our happy dwelling place, should sing and reioyce: we would if we might ha

We play as young children, who hauing all day complayned of sicknesse, doo become whole at the sight of the mediciné: we resemble men vexed with the tooth ache, who all the wéeke doo run aboute for helpe, and yet séeing the Barbor comming to pull out their teeth, doo féel no more pain: and are not vnlike vnto those daintie and delicate persons, who at ye pricking of the Pleurisie cry out, and cānot patiently abide the comming of the Surgeon, and

                whē they sée him whetting of his laūce to cut the throte of the disease, doo pull their arme back and créepe into their bedꝭ again, as if he minded to slay their owne persons. We stand in more fear of the Medicine, then of the disease: of the Barbor, then of the pain: and of the pricking, then of the Impostume.
            We stand in more awe of the bitter nesse of the medicine which is soon ouer passed, then of a long and languishing

pain: and doo more tremble at the end of our miseryes, then at the infinit num ber of those whiche in this life we doo sustain. But wherof (I pray you) procéedeth this folly and simplicitie, sauing onely that we knowe not what it is, either of life or death. For we doo feare the thing that we should hope for, and doo desire the thing whereof we should be afeard. We tearme that thing life that is a cōtinuall death, and that death which is the issue out of a lyuing death, and an entrie into euerlasting life.
            What goodnesse is there I pray you in this life, why we should so earnestly séeke the same? or what euil is there in death that we should so diligently eschue the apprehention therof? nay what euil is there not in this life, or what goodnes dooth not death comprehend?

Let vs procéed. Groweth he? his labors doo growe with him: scarce is he escaped ye hands of his Nurces, or knoweth what play is: but by and by he is committed to the hands of some scholemaster (I speake of those that be best and moste curiously brought vp) then if he play, he is stil in feare: if he study, it is against his will. All this age, because he is in ye custodye of an other, is to him a prison: he mindeth or aspyreth to nothing, but how to be set frée from ye subiectiō of other men, and so become maister & guider of him self

But I pray you what other is this entry into youth, sauing the death of his infācy: and afterwarde his comming to mans age, the death of his youth: and the beginning of to morrowe, then the death of this day? so that in this wise he desireth death, accounting life miserable, and therfore cannot be estéemed happy or contented.

Such (if a man wil examin them (is in few woords, the nature of woorldly pleasures. There is none so swéet, but that the bitternes of the same dooth surmoūt it: none of so pleasant taste, but that it leaueth a more sower smack and greeuous disdain behinde it. Yea and which wurse is, none

                so moderate, but that it hath his corosiue and punishment in it self.
            I néed not héer rehearse such displeasures as no man can denye, as strife, debate, wounds, murder, flight, diseases, and other hasards, which sometime his owne incontinencie, and somtimes the insolencie of this vnruly age bringeth him into. So that the pleasures ther of béeing but displeasures, or his sorowe drunck as a mixtion with wormewood water, it plainly appéereth what gréef & bitternes he féeleth or tasteth of. This to be bréef, is the life of a young man, who béeing gotten out of the lawfull wardeshippe of either his Parents or maisters, yéeldeth and abandoneth him self vnto all licence, or rather indéede bondage of his passion, whiche neither more nor lesse, but as an vncleane spirit that possesseth him dooth still vex &

            Againe if he accepteth reason for his guide, then falleth he into manifolde dangers. Then must he be redy to fight at the end of euery féelde and at euerye tract or steppe stand redy at defence, as one hauing his enemye round 
                  〈◊〉
                him and still vexing of him.
            But what enemie? Euen his owne de sires, and what so euer he lyketh of far or néere. To be bréef, the greatest enemye in the worlde, the very worlde it self, yea, whiche is worse, a thousand false and dangerouse intelligēces with in his owne person, besides other despe rate passions procéeding of his owne flesh, which in that age is in ful force and power, watching the time, hower and opportunitie to intrap him, and to cast him hedlong into all kinde of vice.
            God only and no other enforceth him to take this way, who guideth his steps euen to the end, graunting him victorie in all his combates, and yet we

of those, how many afterward doo retire again?
            Well, let him followe either the one way or the other, he must fully resolue him self, either to yeelde to a tyrannous passion, or els to vndertake a perpetuall and greeuous warfare: yea, either to cast him selfe downe he

            Thus in few woords on the one side, you sée how the youngman who in his youth hath quaffed of by full cuppes the false and vain pleasures of this world, (resembling drunckards the next day after their feasts & royotous banquets) is either quite astonished, either so far out of taste and temper that he will no more, or els is finally so quayled that he can no more, and then dooth neuer afterwarde thin

            On the otherside, you may also perceiue how faint, wery, and as it were euen broken with this continuall 
                  •…
               il he is, which valiantly hath embraced

reason, and ouercome his passions, in so muche that he is either ready to yéeld, or els cōtent by death to acquite him self from farther peril. This is the commoditie and contentation of this flourishing age whiche Children doo so ernestly aspire vnto, and olde men repine at.
            Next followeth the age of perfecte man, wherein eche one hopeth of wisdome, and taking his owne ease. Perfect in déed it may be called, but in this only respect, that all the imperfections of humain nature, which before, either vnder ye simplicitie of Childehood, or els vnder the lightnes of youth lay hidden, are therein reuealed and doo come to perfection. Wherfore we wil ouerpasse all such as worldly iudgement accounteth wise, happy or blessed, and come to the rest.
            Hetherto as you sée, we haue alwayes played in feare, and inioyed short pleasures, accompanied with long repentance.
            But now cōmeth to sight Couetousnes and Ambition, which doo promise vnto

vs a full contentation of goods, and a worlde of honors in case we will worship them: whervppon, few (except the assured chosen Children of the almightie) can escape, but either for looue of the one, or els for hope of the other (as béeing snared in their beautifull illusions) doo throwe them selues hedlong from the pinacle. What therfore is the end of all this contentation?
            The couetouse man maketh a thousand voiages by sea and by land, incur reth infinit dangers of pirats & théeues, escapeth wunderful perils and Shipwracks, and liueth in continuall feare and danger, yea and often loseth all his time and laboure, reaping nought els but diseases, goutes, with suche other like discommodities for the time to come. For the obtaining of his premeditated ease, he now hath forgone his quietnes, and in séeking for money: hath loste his life. But admit be hath obtained great welth, that he hath robbed the East countries of their pearles, and dryed vp all the westerne mines, shall 
                  •…
               e thē be at quiet, or wil be think him felf satisfied? Admit also all his fraughts and voyages be ended, and

that through his passed trauailes with labour and toil both of body and minde, he hath sufficiently heaped and horded vp for time to come, is he not fallen out of one inconuenience into an other? This then is no end but a chaunge of his miserie.
            Aforetime he sought the obtaining of goodes, now he seareth the losse of the same: he got them through painful heat and trauail, he now possesseth them in quaking colde and trembling: he hath incurred daunger of rouers and théeues in séeking for them: now théeues and murderres doo on alsides assail him. He took paines to dig and hale them out of the Earth: he now laboureth to hide them vp again. To be bréef, after all his voiages and iorneyes he is entred into a prison, and as a conclusion of all his bodily labours he hath begunne an infinit trouble of minde. What therfore finally hath this poor wretch obtained, as a recompence of so many miseryes? Through the manifolde illusions and enchantments of this de uilish spirit of couetousnes, be persw adeth him self to haue gotten some exquisite and rare Jewel, but is indéed handeled as

one of those poore wretches whome the Deuil seduceth vnder coulour of aiding their necessities, and yet hauing obtained bis purpose, leaueth their hands yea and Coffers ful of leaues and Ashes, in steade of Erownes and such like. He possesseth or ra

               aue goods but dare not vse them, and doo (in my opiniō) inioy things wherin they cannot reiuyce. They haue them, but neither for them selues neither for any other, yea of all that they haue, they haue nothing, and yet doo want what so euer they haue not. Wherfore we are to return to this point, that the obtayning of all these false goods is no other, then trauaile of the body, the possession wherof, is moste commonly trouble of minde, and that so much the greater, as the spirite is more sensible, suttle, and delicate then the body. The first feeling therfore of the couetous mans miserie beginneth whē he looseth his goodꝭ, whē shipwrack, spoile, enemies, & such like calamities (wherunto al trāsitory goodꝭ are subiect) dooth rauish & carry them away: then he wéepeth, cryeth out & tormēteth him self like a litle childe y• hath lost his bable & al to no purpose. It is vn possible to perswade him, y• all worldly goods are transitory: he thīketh him sel

               ot only spoiled but euē slain outright,

and hauing fixed his whole trust in these vanities, the same béeing loste he falleth into dispair, from the whiche be may hardly be reuoked: yea and so much as he wanteth of his gain, wherof he made a full account, he thincketh him selfe to haue lost: and all that yéeldeth him not greate and extraordinary cōmoditie, séemeth in his eye to turn to his hinderance, whereby we somtime sée him fall into suche dispaire, that to his power hee hasteneth the course of his owne life.
            To be bréefe, the recompence that Couetousnes yéeldeth to his continuall scholers, resembleth the rewardꝭ of the Deuil his progenitor, namely that hauing awhile gratified them with their prophane desires, he finally either deliuereth them ouer to the hangman, or els him selfe breaketh their necks. I minde not heer to rehearce, such offences and mischeefs as the couetous men doo abandon them selues vnto for the obtaining of their goods whereof their consciences doo féel such a perpetuall remorse as that they can neuer be quiet, for it is sufficient that we vnderstand that in this so violent an exercise wherin

moste mortall men doo stay & abuse them selues, the body is slain, the minde vexed, and the soule cōdemned without any pleasure or contentation at all.
            Now then let vs come to ambition which with desire of honor dooth fondly bewitch the mightyest in the worlde: shall we ther in finde any more ease thē in the other, or not rather lesse? The other deceiueth vs in yéelding in liew or all rewards, onely the vile dirt of the earth, this féedeth vs with nothing but smoke and winde. The presents of this are vain, and the gifts of the other course. In either of them we slide into a bottomlesse pit: how beit this of the twain is the most dangerouse, notwith standing the water séemeth more pleasant & cléer. Among those that haue imbraced ambition, some doo obtain great estematiō among Kings & Princes, other becōe gouernors ouer armyes, and so others in their degrée: their inferiors doo salute, reuerēce, and worship them: they are apparelled in purple, scarlet, and cloth of golde: in beholding of them it séemeth there is no contentation in the world but theirs.

               a ner an ache of the minde, is the greatest gréef that can be: and thus doo you sée those menne quite deuoide of amitie, which among all wise men is euer accounted a moste excellent and souerain commoditie. Yea you shall more plainly yet vnderstand, that when Fortune turneth her back to them, all men doo flée their companyes, and when shee snarreth at them, euery man looketh awry vpon thē: so that béeing once spoiled of their triumphant robes, no man will knowe them. Also contrarywise, some Kuffian or infamous person shall be clothed in their apparell, who without difference in vertue or title shall inherite their calling, possesse all their former honors, and puffe them sel ues vp in pride, like vnto the Asse whiche bare the Image of ye Goddesse Isis, who was proude of so many curtesies as were doone to the same, and finally

that Fortune rideth them like Asses.
            But thou wilt say, (at the least so long as she continueth) they shall take their ease, and inioy their owne conten tation: and who that hath his pleasure for thrée or foure yeeres more or lesse, is not accursed all his life time. Yes assuredly, vnlesse it be ease to liue in continuall feare of béeing throwne from the step whervnto he hath attained: or to desire with great trauail to clyme still hyer and hyer. Those (my fréend) whōe thou accountest at their ease because thou séest but the outsides of them, are farre other wise within: their inwarde partes are strong prysons, ful of dungeons, holes, darchnesse, serpents and torments. Thou thinkest their lodgings large, which in their opinions are very strait. Thou supposest them very high, but they account them selues to be very lowe. Yea and often, he which but thinketh him selfsick: is wurse at ease then he which is sick in déed. And there be some, euen Kings: who think them selues but slaues, & indéed are nothing els, for we are nothing but in opinion.

They drinck in vessels of golde or siluer, and that is the same rathen earth or glasse wherin men fil and drink poyson. They haue their beds very soft and delicately trimmed vp, neither may they heare a mouse ron thorowe their chamber, or suffer a flye to come néere their faces: when as a poore contry mā sléepeth by ye noise of a spring or in a market place, hauing no bed but earth, nor couering but heauen: and yet these men amōg all their quietnes and daintie lodging, doo nothing but turne and tosse vp and downe in their beds, still imagininge that they heare some stirring, yea euen their rest takes no rest at all.
            To be bréefe, wilte thou knowe the difference betwéene them and the hardest intreated prisoners? Either of them are chained vp, eche of them beareth a waightie burthen vppon them, but in that the one is of Iron and the other of Golde: so is the one chained but in body, and the other in minde.
            
               The Prisoner draweth his Irons after him, the Courtier is chained vp in him self. The Prisoner many tlmes is inwardly comforted through his bodely paines, and singeth in the chéefe of his miserye. The Courtier béeing tormented in his minde dooth continually laboure his body and cannot therunto giue any respite.
            And as for the contentation whiche thou imaginest them to haue, thou art far wide. Thou iudgest and thinkest them mightie because they be highly exalted, but therin thou art as wise as he which accounteth a dwarf sitting on the top of a stéeple or vpon an high hil to be a tall man. Thou art so good a Geometrician, that thou mesurest ye Image by his piller, which to knowe the true proportion, should be mesured alone, net ther ne

Thou iudgest them mightie (if mightinesse may be on Earth) whiche in respect of Heauen, is but as nothing. But if thou couldest enter into their mindes, thou wouldest be of an other opinion.

For true greatnesse consisteth in despising all these vaine points of greatnes wherunto they be slaues, which also in their opinion they haue not attained vnto, for stil they desire to clyme hyer, and séem to them selues neuer to be hye inough.
            You shall sée one cast thus in his minde. If I might attain to such a degrée, then were I well content, there would I stay: Hauing attained therunto, he dooth scarce take breth, but would fain yet clime higher. That whiche when he was belowe séemed to him the highest, is now in his opinion scarce one step. He thinketh him self lowe, be cause there be some hyer then he, but he considereth not him self to be on hye, for that there be many thousands lower then he. Yea, in the end be clymeth so hye, that either his winde faileth in the way, or els he slippeth

            It may be you will (through the examples whereof, bothe Histories and mans memory are replenished) graūt me this pointe, and will say. Those men whom nature hath brought foorth with the Crown on their heds, and septer in their hands: those whome euen from their birth she hath placed in so eminent thrones, and so haue not labou red to clime thither, doo séeme without contradiction, to be exēpt from all these iniuryes, and so consequently may say them selues happy.

Of Tiberius his successor he wil confesse, that he holdeth the Empire as a wulfe by the eares, and that if he could without danger of béeing bitten he would willingly let go the same. He will complain of Fortune, which hath guided him so high, and then taken away the Ladder, that he cannot afterwarde come downe againe. Dioclesian a worldly, wise and vertuous Prince, will preferre his voluntarie bannishment to Solon, before the whole Romaine Empire. To be bréefe, the Emperor Charles the fifth (whome our age dooth account the happyest that lyned in many yéeres) will cursse vnto

vs his conquests, his victories, and his tryumphes, and will not be ashamed to say, that he hath found more ease in comparison in one day in his vowed solitarinesse: then in all the rest of his triumphant life.
            Shall we then account those blessed in this their imagined greatnes, who doo account them selues accursed, seeking their felicitie in the diminishing of their estate, who also in the vniuersall worlde cannot finde any one conuenient place of rest for their greatnesse, neither any bed wherupon they may take their quiet sléepe?

vs his conquests, his victories, and his tryumphes, and will not be ashamed to say, that he hath found more ease in comparison in one day in his vowed solitarinesse: then in all the rest of his triumphant life.
            Shall we then account those blessed in this their imagined greatnes, who doo account them selues accursed, séeking their felicitie in the diminishing of their estate, who also in the vniuersall worlde cannot finde any one conuenient place of rest for their greatnesse, neither any bed wherupon they may take their quiet sléepe?
            Happie is he onely who liueth contented in his minde, and farre more accurssed then any, is he that canne be content with nothing. Miserable then was Pirrus King of Albanye, who sought for to conquere the whole worlde, wherby (sayeth he) to obtaine quietnesse, and yet séeketh so farre for that thing whiche is so néere his hand.

and yet within thrée dayes after was contented with six or seuen foot of earth.
            To be bréefe, if they be borne on the top of the Alpes, they séek to clime into Heauen. If they haue conquered the Kings of the Earth, then haue they sōe quarels to ple ade with God, and séek to diminish his dominions: they neuer haue any end or final terme before that God laughing to scorne in their vain driftꝭ (when they think them selues on the hyest staffe of the Ladder) doo thunder downe all this their presumption, breaketh in péeces the Scepter in their hands, and many times ouerthroweth them with their owne Crownes.
            Finally, in few woords to rehearse all the blisse that may be comprehended in whatsoeuer ambition promiseth to them. They indure much euil to the end to obtain euil. They suppose by climing higher toget from this euil, when as the hight wherunto so painfully they doo aspire, is the very root of the same.
            I speake not héere of the miserie of those who all their liues hauing helde out their hatꝭ to catch ye liberalyties of courtlike Fortune, and yet can get nothing, who sōtimes also euē with wunderfull

hartburning, shall sée some one who hauing taken lesse paine shall receiue the rewardes out of their hands: who through thrusting them selues for ward haue lost the same, yea and peraduenture throwen into a third mans hand, who neuer stirred for the same: out of the hands of those who with ouer strainīg of it haue let it escape through their fingers, and so lost it. Those men are of all men accounted accursed and are so in déed, in as much as them selues doo so think. Let it therfore suffise you, that all the liberalities whiche the Deuil throweth among vs out of his windowes are but bayts, that all his re wards are but snares, and that he seeketh to inioye vs onely, who doo thrust our selues forwarde for such things, as moste accursed is he that hath moste hap in méeting with the same.
            Wel wil some say, the couetous man hath no commoditie of all his goods, the ambitious man hath nothing but euils: either of them to say trueth dooth indéed frame to them selues an assured hell in this world. But may there not be some one who tending to the law or remaining about the Prince, may peacibly

inioy these goodes without following these outragious motions, and obtaine some honor with quietnes and cōtentation of his minde? Surely in the first ages when as their remained among men yet some sinceritie, there might be such: but now that they be framed as in these daies we sée thē, I cā perceiue no meanes how it should be. In these dayes dele you in any worldly affaires, either you must doo wel or euil. If euil, God is your enemie & you haue your conscience a tormentor continually vex ing of you. If wel, then are men your aduersaryes, yea and that the mightyest among them, whose enuie and euill wil dooth watch you, and whose cruelty and tiranny dooth perpetually threten you. Please the people and you please a beast, in pleasing of whome you shall displease your self. Please your self and you shall displease God. Please god, and you shall incur a thousand worldly dangers & sustain a thousand disple asures: which is the cause, that hearing the spée ches of the honester sort & of those which be best contented in their degrées, be it that their spéeches be premeditated, or that through force of the trueth they doo escape them, you shall vnderstand this.

One wisheth he had chaūged his gown with his farmer, another affirmeth it to be a goodly matter to haue no such voca tion, another complaineth yt his hed is troubled with pallaice or courtlike mat ters frō which he hopeth wt all spéed to withdraw him self. To be bréefe, you shall finde them all w ery of their voca tion, nothing inuying the calling of others, notwithstanding yt if you would séem to take thē at their woords ye most parte could be contēt to recant. All men are wery of those affaires wherunto his age is subiect, & yet wisheth to be higher wherby he might exempt him self, notwithstanding that otherwise he would somuch as in him lay auoid all age & to his power flée frō ye same. What were we best therfore to doo in this great con trariety & confusiō of mindes, should we the better to obtain perfect quietnes eschue the company of men, and hide our selues in ye woods among wilde beastꝭ? to auoide these hainous passions, should we depart from the flocks of reasonable creatures? or to escape these worldly euils should we sequester our selues out of the worlde? indéed if in so dooing we could li
                  •…
               e quietly, it were something.
            
               But alas, eche one that would cannot so doo, yea and such as doo so, doo not therin finde the rest which they séek for. Some would gladly doo it, but shame of the world restraineth thē. Fooles they are to be ashamed of him whome in hart they doo condemne, and more fooles to take counsaile of the greatest enemie whiche they can or may haue. To others it is alleadged, that they must serue the common welth, and yet they sée not that those which giue them such Counsail, doo serue none but them selues, and that the moste parte séeke not greatly the cōmon welth, vnlesse they finde some priuate commoditie, whervpon to take holde. Unto some it is said that by their good example they may amend the rest, and yet doo they not consider that a hundred helthful men, shall rather take the plague in an infected Citie, yea euen the Phisicians them selues, rather then any one shall obtain helth, that the entrie into such a Citie is properly to tempt God, that against an infected aire there can be no better preseruatiue thē to flée from the same. To be bréef that so like as ye swéet waters falling into the sea doo abridge the

bitternesse of ye same, euen so little may one or two Lots doo touching the reformation of a whole Sodomiticall court. And as for the wiser sorte, who no lesse carefull for the soule then the body, doo séeke for the same a sound and helthful aire, far frō the infectiō of euil waners, and who being led by the hād of some of Gods Angels, doo in good time after the example of Lot, withdraw them selues into sōe little village of Segor far from all worldly corruption, into some champion contrie, not néer to any pestiferous town, there at their leasure to entend to some science and earnest contemplations. To them béeing in no dāgerous place doo I wel agrée: but in that them selues doo carry infection with them, they cannot wel be exempt. They flee the courte, the court stil followeth them euery way. They seèke to escape the the world, and the world pursueth them euen to death: hardly throughout the whole world, shall they finde any corner wherin ye worlde wil not finde thē, so earnestly dooth it seek their destruction. Again if through the singuler grace of God, they séeme for a while exempt out of these dangers, then are they continually

vexed with pouertie, then is there some domisticall contention, whiche disquieth them, or some kinde of familiar spirite which tempteth them.
            To be short, the worlde by some meanes causeth them to feele him. But the wurst is that when we be past all these outwarde warres and trauailes, thē doo we féel in our selues, so much the more vehemently an inward war and debate of the flesh against the spirite, passion against reason, Earth against Heauen, and the worlde fighting in vs for the worlde, whiche findeth it self continually lodged in the bottome of our owne harts, on what side soeuer we séeke to flée from it.
            I wil say also thus much more, that there be some, who making profession of eschuing worldly vanities, doo in the same séeke the commendation of the worlde. Some doo 
                  •…
               eeme to flée from it, and yet according to the Prouerbe, doo go backwarde to méete it. Yea there are some whiche doo refuse honors, because they would be desired to take the same: and others that doo hide them selues, onely to cause men to séek to them. Thus dooth the worlde many times i

disguised attire dwell in those whiche seeme to flée from the world.
            This then is an abuse, for if we folow the company of men, among thē is his court. If we séek ye wildernes, there hath he his caues & dennes, for in ye desert it self did he tempt our lord Iesus Christ. If we retire into our selues, ther doo we finde him as filthy as any where els. We cannot in our selues slay ye world, without our owne deaths. We are in the world & the world in vs, to seperate vs therfore from ye world, we must seperate our selues & this seperatiō is called death. We are I wéen come forth of the pestiferoꝰ citie, but we cōsider not yt we haue gathered the aire into our wicked cōplexions, yt we cary away the plague with vs, yt our selues are parcell of the same, whervpon through rocks, desertꝭ, and mountains, it wil stil followe and accompany vs: hauing fled the infection of others, we haue ye infection in our selues. We haue gone from among men, but we haue not put man from among vs: this tēpestious sea tormēted vs, we were sick at our harts, & were desirous to vomit, and therfore to discharge our stomacks, we haue gone from Ship to Ship, from a greate one to a little one.

We promise our selues quietnes, but in vain, for stil ye same winde bloweth, ye same waues rise, & the same humors doo mooue. Unto all mē is there no other hauen or porte of rest saue only death. We lay sick in a Chamber on the stréet side, or opening into ye market place, we remoued into a backer chamber, where was no such noise: but notwithstāding the noise was lesse, yet was the Ague no whit diminished, neither therby lost any parte of his wunted heat. Let 
                  •…
               s chaunge bed, chamber, house, yea and Contrie so often as we list, yet shall we stil finde the same vnquietnes because our selues are there, and that we séeke not so much to become other men, as to remooue into other places. We seeke solitarines, to th'end to anoy solitarines. we doo say we flée and withdraw our selues from among the wicked: but we take with vs our couetousnes, our ambition, our royelous liuing, & all other our wicked affection, which procure to vs innumerable remorses of consciēce, and a thousand times a day doo put vs in minde of the rootes and onions of Egipt. They doo still go ouer the ferry with vs and therfore on eche side of the

water, are we at a perpetuall combate. But if we could discharge this train, whiche eateth vs and gnaweth our spirits, vndoutedly we should haue rest, not in solitarines only, but euen in the middest of ye preace of men. Bréefly the life of man vpon Earth is a perpetuall warfare.
            Béeing deliuered from outward enterprices, we are to take héed of inward conspiracyes. The Grecians are gone aside, we haue a Sinon in vs whiche wil yéeld the place to them. We must continually wake and haue alwaies an eye to the watch, holding our weapons in our hands, vnlesse we be minded at all times to be supprised and yéelded at the pleasure of our enemyes. And I pray you whiche way may we in the end escape their dāger? not through the woods, the riuers, or the mountaines, not by preasing among company, neither by running into an hole. There is but one onely way, and that is death, which finally deuiding our spirit from our flesh, the clene and pure part of o

            As for the contentation which might be in the solitarie exercises of the wise, as the reading of holy scriptures & prophane books of all sciences & discipline. I doo wel graunt that this is a far other matter thē these wilde huntings which maketh wilde moste parte of men vexed wt these or such like diseases of their mides, & yet must all néedꝭ passe vnder the arrest of the wisest of all, wise Salomon, who allegeth yt all this comforted with the nature of man, is no other thē vanitie and trauail of minde. Some doo all their liues learn to speak of amendment, and yet doo neuer think of amending their liues. Others doo Logically dispute of reason & of art, and yet many times doo lose their natural reson them selues. Othersdo learn by Arithmetick to deuide euen the least fractions, & yet cannot part one shilling with their néedy brother. Others by Geometrie can measure ye féeldꝭ, y• townes, & the contry: and yet vnskilful in mesuring them selues. The Pusition can agrée the voice,

soundꝭ and tunes togither: and yet hath nothing in his hart whiche disagréeth not, or any passion in his minde that is in his right tune. The Astronomer can look vp: and yet fall in the pit at hand, he can foretel the things to come: & yet loose that which is present, he can often haue his eye in Heauen: when his hart is buried ver y lowe in earth.

All this knowledge appeaseth not the disagréement that man féeleth in him self, they heale not the diseases of the minde, they make a man learned, but not good, and cunning, but not wise, and this I say more, that the more a man knoweth, the more he graunteth him self to be ignorant of, the fuller that his mīde is, ye emptier dooth he finde ye same because that how muche so euer of any science a man can know in this world, it is neuerthelesse the lest parte of that which he is ignoraunt of: and therfore his whole skill consisteth i

            To be short, we must with Salomon return to this point that the beginning and ending of wisdome is the fear of God, which wisdome is neuerthelesse in the world cryed downe as méer folly, and pursued as a capital enemie, and as he which feareth God, néed not to feare any euil, because all his euils are conuerted into goodnes, euen so he must not look for any goodnes in this

world hauing the deuil his formall ene mie, whome the scripture termeth the Prince of this world.

               th so many euils heaped vp in it, that to write of them all would require an other worlde as big as it is. Yea in case the happyest man that we can finde, would but way his blesses with his mishaps, he would accoūt him self moste accursed: and some there be who think him happy, and yet if they had but thrée daies set in his place, they would resigne the same to the first commer: yea and which is more, if ye same man should but consider, first of all the goods and commodities that euer he receiued: and then. of the euil whiche he hath indured for the obtaining of the same, and hauing them, of the pain that he hath taken to saue and kéep them (I speake only of such cōmodities as may be kept, & not of those ye wither away in a moment) he would surely with him

self giue this verdit of him selfe, that euen the kéeping of the chéefest felicities in this world, is but labour, trauail and infelicitie. Let vs therefore conclude that infancie is but a foolish simplicitie: youth a vain heate: mans age a painful carefulnes: and age a troublesome languishing, that our eyes are nothing but teares: our pleasures, vexations of minde: our goods, racks and torments: our honors, waightie vanities: and our rest, a disquietnes. Also that to passe frō age to age, is but to departe from one euil to an other: from a small one to a greate, and that it is alwaies one billowe or waue driuing of an other, vntil we come to the Hauen of death. Let vs I say conclude, that this life is no other then a desire of the life to come, a sorowing for the life past, a disdaine of that which we haue tasted, and a desire of that that hetherto we haue not felt, a vain remembrance of the estate passed and an vncertain waiting for ye which is to come. To be bréef, that in all the life is nothing certain neither assured, but only the certaintie and assuraunce of death.
            Wel, beholde now death commeth to

vs: sée, that which so long we haue feared dooth now draw néere vnto vs. We must now therfore cōsider whether she be such a thing as men make vs to beléeue, and whether we ought so to flée from her as ordinarily we doo.
            We are afeard as little Children of a Mastif, or of the Idols of Hecate. We doo abhorre her, but that is only because we take her to be other then indéed she is, namely sorowful, withered & ougley, euen suche a one as it pleaseth the Painters to present vnto vs vpon the walles. We

Shall we therfore feare lest taking vs out of miserie she should hale vs into the hauen?
            
               You wil say that in death is paine, be it so, so is there also in the healing of wounds, for such is the nature of humaine things, that one euil cannot be healed but by an other. To cure a brusing there must be incision.

               f then she be no greef, wherfore should we accuse her of all those gréefs whiche our life at the departure thereof dooth minister vnto vs, vnlesse we wil also blame the time wherein we were not in those sorowes which at our birth we began to indure? If the comming into the world were in teares, why should we meruail that the issue out of the same be so also? The beginning of our béeing, béeing the beginning of our sorowes, is it to bee meruailed that the end is alike? If our not béeing in the former worldes hath béene exempt of sorowe, and now cōtrariwise our béeing in this world be ful of sorowe, whome shal we in reasō accuse of these our last sorowes whether our not béeing before time, or the rest of our present béeing?
            We thinck not that we dye before we yéelde the last gaspe, and yet if we looke wel we doo dayly in euery houre and moment dye. We feare death as a thing vnaccustomed, and yet haue nothing more common in vs, for our life is but a continuall death: euen so long as we liue, so long doo we die: as we doo growe, so dooth our life diminish. We

let not one step so soon into life, but as soon we set an other into death. Who so hath liued a third parte of his yéeres, hath also passed a third part of his death, and who the tone halfe, is alredy halfe dead. So much of our life as is passed, is dead: that whiche is present dooth liue and dye togither, and that whiche is to come shall likewise dye. That that is past is no more: that that is to come is not yet, and that that is present bothe is and is not. To be bréefe, all this life is but death. It is as a candle lighted in our bodies. In some y• winde wasteth it, in other some it putteth it out before it be half spent, and in other some it suffereth it to continue to the end: but be it as it wil, according as it lighteth, so dooth it burn, his light is a burning, his flame a vanishing smoke, and his last fire is the vttermoste end of his cotton and the last drop of his moisture. Euen so is the life of man.
            The life and death of man is all but one thing. If we call ye last breth death, the like name must we giue to all the rest afore pasied, for they all doo procéed out of one place and are all of a like fashion. One only difference is there betwéen

For all shall to vs be time present, and this time present shall neuer abandon vs: We shall no longer consume in vain and sorowful pleasures, but shall be replenished with a true and firme ioy. We shall no longer labour to beap vp the exhalations of the earth, for hea uen shalbe ours. This masse of Earth which accustomably drew vs towarde the earth, shalbe in the earth. We shall no longer striue to mount from step to step, and from honor to honor: for we shalbe exalted into Heauen abooue all worldly honors & from abooue shall we laugh them to scorne that doo wunder at vs, whiche doo striue for the válue of a point, and like Children fight togither for lesse value then an Aple. More combates shall we not sustaine within our selues, for our flesh shalbe dead, but our spirite in ful life: our passion buried, and our reasō set at libertie. Our soule beeing deliuered out of this filthy and stinking prison, wherin it hath so long lurked and crouched, shal take aire, and acknowledging his ancient dwelling place, shall call again to minde his former brightnes and dignitie. This flesh my fréend which thou féelest, and this

body, whiche thou touchest is not the soule: for the soule is borne in heauen, and Heauen is his Countrie and aire. In that he is inclosed in ye body, it is as it were by exile and banishment. The soule properly is ye life and spirite. The soule is rather a heauenly and celestiall qualitie, exempt from all grose and materiall substance, and this body such as it is, is no other then a bark or shel ouer the spirit, and therfore must of necessitie flée a sunder when we come to our departure, if we wil perfectly liue or cléerly behold

            We are (say we) Christians: we doo

beléeue after this life, life euerlasting. We acknowledge that death is but a separation of the bodye and the soule, that the soule shall returne to his blessed rest, for to reioyce in God, who only is all goodnesse, and that in the last day shee shall againe put on her body, which then shall be no more subiect to corruption. We doo fil all our Bookes with this goodly discourse, and yet comming to the point, the onely name of death, as the moste horrible thing in the worlde, maketh vs to quake and tremble. If we beléeue that, y• we haue said, what doo we then feare? to be happie? to be at quiet? to liue in greater contentatiō in one moment then euer we could doo in all our mortall life how long so euer it hath beene? Either we must confesse, wil we, nil we, that we beléeue but to halues, that we haue nothing in vs but woords, and that all our discourses (euen as of these valiant table Knights) are but vaunts and vanities: and therfore see what we say.
            We knowe, that departing out of this life we shall passe to a better, and therof we doute not at all: but we fear the great passage that is betwéen them both, which we must ouercome. O

man of him self is sufficiently taught that alredy: no man is ignorant in that occupation. But we must learne in this world to dye, and for the obtaining of one good death, we must in our selues dye dayly, preparing vs as if the end of euery day, were also the end of our life: wheras contrariwise nothing dooth more offend our eares then to heare of death.
            Oh sencelesse men, we doo habandon our liues to th'ordinary hazards of war for twentie shillings matter. In hope of some smal botie, we be the first at the assaulte, running into places frō whēce there is no hope of return, and that ma ny times with the danger bothe of our bodyes and soules. And yet for the exempting of vs out of all dangers, for the conquest of incōparable treasures, and for the entrie into euerlasting life, we doo refrain from setting forward of one step wherin is no dificultie or danger at all, but only fear to witholde vs. Yea we doo so stick there, that were it not that whether we will or no, we must passe the said step, & God euen against our willes wil doo vs good, hardely throughout all the whole worlde, we

should finde any one, how miserable or wretched soeuer he were that willingly would passe that way. Others wil say, had I liued fiue or six score yéeres, I could euen be cōtent, I care for no longer life: but me thinks to die so young, it were against reason. I would knowe the world before I go out of it. Ah poor ignorant man y• thou art, in this world there is nōe either young or olde.

            They cannot threaten him of woorse then death, and that is it that he assureth him self of.

For the Christian is not for him self but for God, of whome he holdeth his life to inioy the same so long as it shall please him, and to who me he

God exerciseth one vntill he sweate, another parcheth he in the Sun, & another dooth he euen bake and wither vp altogither, and yet leaueth he none of all his abrode, but giueth them all rest, paying them their wages in time conuenient. Who that leaueth his woork before he be called loseth the same, & he yt is im portunate before the time forgoeth his wages. We must all depend vpon his pleasure, who in the middest of all our labours graunteth vs rest.
            
               To be bréefe, the trauayles of this life must not cause vs to hate the same, for that were but cowardise and want of hart. Neither must the pleasures of the same procure vs to looue it, for that were but folly & vanitie: but we must vse it to the seruice of God, who after the same shall giue vs assured rest, and shall leade vs into euerlasting pleasures whiche perish not. We must not also flée from death, for it were very childish to fear it and in fléeing away to méet with the same. Again we must not séeke it, for that were but rashnes, neither dooth euery man die that wil. There is as much desperatenes in the one as cowardlines in the other, and in neither of bothe is there any kinde of magnanimitie. Let it therfore suffice vs to stay for it, and that stedfastly and cōtinually to ye end it neuer finde vs vn prouided. For as there is nothing more certain then death, so also is there nothing more vncertain then ye sorowe of the same, which is knowen to none but to one God, the onely Author of life, in whome we should all laboure to liue and dye.

We must not to much looue our liues, neither vnreasonably hate the same. We must finish them when reason warneth vs, and yet not rashly departe with the same, but euen let them fréely run out their course.
                  The wise and valiaunt man muste not flée from this life, but soberly departe with all, and abooue all thinges eschew this vicious passion which hath ouer come many: namely ouer greate desire of death.

He that willeth thée to think vpon death, willeth thée to remēber libertie, & he that hath learned to die hath forgotten to serue. For death is abooue all power, or at the least out of the iurisdiction of all things. What careth he for Prisons, kéepers or bolts. He hath a doore alwaies open. One on ly chaine can binde vs which is ye looue of this life, the whiche also indéede we should not quite cast away, but by litle and little lessen the same to the end, in case death should come, nothing might let or stop vs from him.

I pray thée whether is more méet that thou obey nature, or nature obey thee. What carest yu whē thou must depart séeing there is no remedy? Thou shouldest not take thought to liue long, but how thou liuest long. "To liue long dependeth vpō Gods wil, to liue inough (through his permission) is in thy hand, Life is long and life is ful.

                  TO liue is no delicate matter, thou hast begun a long race. thou shalt fall and rise again, yea euen fall downe and wax weary, héere shalt thou leaue one of thy companions, there shalt thou bring an other to his graue, in another place thy self shalt be afeard. Through many such by pathes shalt thou passe this rough way. Must thou dye? prepare thy minde against all things. Let thy hart knowe that it is comen into a good place where wéepings & care haue taken their lodging, and where pale diseases and sorowful age haue chosen

their habitation. In this cōpany must thou néedꝭ passe ouer thy life: wel maist thou despise & make none accoūt of these things, but auoid them thou canst not.
                  Thou shalt not regarde them if thou thinkest often & reckenest as of things which must néeds happen. All men doo approch more valiātly to the thing lōg before premeditated, & doo resist ye same couragiously: and contrariwise be suppressed & taken on a suddain all astonished at small matters: séeing then that all thigs (were it but for their nouelty) doo séem gréeuoꝰ: in cōtinually thinking héerupon yu shalt not be as aprentise to séek what thou hast to doo against such euils. Let vs not therfore wūder at any thing wherunto we are borne. Of thē no man can complain because they are alike vnto all men. I say in this case alike, because he that hath escaped thē was neuerthelesse subiect vnto thē. For the law is not called indifferent because euery mā vseth it, but because it was indifferently ordained vnto all men. Let vs frame our mindes to equi tie & without lamēting our mortall nature pay our tribute willingly. Is win ter colde? colde is necessary, doth sūmer

bring heat? we must not be wtout beat. Dooth the distempered aire hinder our helth? we must be sick. Somtimes we shall méete with a wilde beast, yea often times with men more dangerous then wilde beasts. Fire wil consume some, and water other some. We can not alter ye nature of things. The best then is to pay that which we cānot be quit of, and without murmuring to immitate and follow the wil of God y• author of all things. It is the parte of an euil souldier to follow his captain with howlings. Destinie leadeth him that goeth of his owne accorde, & draweth him that commeth against his wil.

               Honest men therefore must take in

good parte and thinck wel of what so happeneth to them. It skilleth not what thou sufferest, but how thou sufferest it. Doost thou not sée that Fathers and mothers doo intreate their Children

               So God towarde honest men beareth a Fatherly harte and a manly looue. He troubleth and molesteth them with laboure, sorowe, and losses, wherby they may gather and obtaine true force. But those bodyes whiche are fatted vp, doo not only faile in laboure, but also languish away through sluggishnesse, fainting and falling downe vnder their owne laboure and weight. The felicitie whiche was neuer hurt,

cannot indnre any great stripe. Amōg many stoute woords of our fréend Demetrius, this béeing stil fresh and sounding in mine eares dooth best please me.

Capitaine send his chosen Souldiers to scirmish with the enemie, to view a way, to winne a passage and to driue those away whiche doo kéepe the same.
               None of them saith, my Capitaine hath doone me wrong, but rather, he ac counteth well of him. So likewise should all those say, who through Gods permission doo indure those euils of the whiche Cowards and effeminate persons be wery. God did account vs worthy to be tryed how much mans nature can suffer and indure.
               Flee therfore these delights, eschue this faint and effeminate felicitie whiche distempereth and molifieth the hart, lulling it asléepe in a perpetuall drunkennesse except there ha

               Therefore God towarde the good menne dooth as Schoolemaisters towarde their Scholers, in giuing the

painfullest lessons to those in whom

               Thinkest thou (I pray thée) that the Lacedemonians hated their Children, when in proouing their natures they did euen whip them openly, yea, their owne Fathers exhorted them valeauntly to beare the stripes, and all torne and halfe swoūded, desired them to heap wound vpon wound.
               What meruaile is it therefore though GOD haue hardly intreated and tryed the valeaunt mindes. To be in continuall daunger causeth vs not to care for daunger. And so doo Maryners strengthen their bodyes to the aire of the Sea: Labourers harden their hands to woorke: Souldiers pra

                  I doo also remember this couragious voice of Demetrius. Of one thing, oh immortall Godꝭ (saith he) doo I cōplain of you, and that is, that you did no soner shew me your willes. For of my selfe I would haue come, where now béeing sente for I doo appéere. Will you take my children? I offer them vn to you. Wil you haue parte of my body? take it. I promise no great thing, for aswel I shall shortly leaue it all. Wil you haue my spirit? why not? the fault shall not be in me, I will not let, but that you may take whatsoeuer you haue giuen me. Willingly shall you cary away what so euer you aske me. What is there els? I had rather haue offered it to you my self, then to leaue it to you. What néed you take it from me? you may take it, but you shall not take it from me, 'for nothing can be taken away, but from him that dooth resist. But I am not con

                  rt of man. But wherfore then dooth God suffer any euil to be doone to good men? Nay contrariwise, he suffereth it

not, for he hath put from them all euils, mischéefs, naughtie thoughts, théeuish counsailes, blinde whordomes, and couetounesse which continually lieth in wait for other mē, & he him self kéepeth them. But séeing he withholdeth them, woulde not some men also desire him to kéep their goods and baggage? No for they doo ease God of that paine, in that they make none account of outwarde things.
               
                  Demetrius threw away his riches estéeming them as a burthen vnto the good minde. Imagine thou therefore that God saith: what haue you to complain of vnto me, you that haue delighted in righteousnes. I haue compassed the rest with false goods, and haue setled their vain mindes in a long & false dreame. I haue painted them out with Golde, Siluer, and Iuorie, but within is nothing any thing worth.
               They whome at the first you take to be blessed, if you look well vppon them, not on that side that you sée when they méete with you, but on the other side which is hidden, you shall finde them miserable,

               But if peraduenture by chaūce they fall and be discouered, then may you plainly perceiue how filthy and déepe vilanie is hidden vnder a borowed brightnesse. But the contrary is in you. I haue giuen you assured goodes which wil continue. The oftener they be turned, and the narowlyer that they be tooked vpon, so much the better and excellent wil they appéere, whiche are these. To make none account of that that we feare, and to disdaine that that ordinarily we doo desire. You shew not
