the ſacramēt
of the aulter
made by a famouſe doctoure
called Fryderyke Nauſea
in Almayne and lately
out of latyn tranſlate
into englyſh by
Iohn̄ More.
         
         
            
            Iohn̄ More to the
chryſten reader.
            
               IT happened me
but late good chryſten
reader, to receyue
and reade in
a booke of a vertuouſe
connynge man called
Fryderyk Nauſea, a booke of
ſermones, ſurely meruelouſe
mete for the ſeaſon. For as
lenton is a tyme (wherof our
ſauyour Chryſte hym ſelfe
ſheweth vs then ſample) that
ought eſſpecyally to be ſpent
in faſtynge, dyuyne ſeruyce,
and ſermones: ſo ſhall not (I
thynke) a man lyghtly fynde
many ſermons made of late,
more frutefull and godly, thā
I fynde many of hys in that

one booke. Dyuers wherof
after I had onys peruſed &
redde / and that they ſo ſpecyally
well lyked me, that I determyned
vtterly wyth my
ſelfe to tranſlate into oure
tongue ſome one (for mo the
ſhortneſſe of tyme wolde not
ſuffer before thys inſtāt feaſt
of Eaſter ſo nere commynge
vppon before the booke came
to my hand) but when I had
ſo determyned, then fared I
wyth all thoſe as doth ſome
yonge lewde ſcatterloue that
went a woynge / whyche hauynge
the choyſe of dyuerſe,
ſo indifferently and therwith
ſo well lyked thē euerychone,
that wottynge not whyche to
choſe fayn wold wedde them
all, and is ſory that he maye

wedde but one. So I, though
bothe I lyked the tother no
leſſe then thys, and as fayne
wolde haue tranſlated them
all as thys one: yet ſyns I
coulde not do any mo in the
tyme / vppon conſyderacyon
that thys ſermon moſt agreed
wyth thys bleſſed feaſt of
Eaſter at hande, as beynge
grounded vppon theſe wordes
Hoc facite in mei commemorationem,
I left the reſt and choyſe
me thys to 
                  •
               orne▪ whyche yet
ſurely I wolde myche rather
haue wyſſhed to haue be trāſla
                  •
               ed
by ſome other, that better
coulde haue handeled it.
For who had ben able as wel
to haue ſette it forth in oure
tōgue & as lyuely as Nauſea
hath done it in ye laten, ſholde

haue done a thyng very worthy
prayſe. But for as myche
as that perfeccyō in lernynge
and eloquence, neyther is in
me, no ſkant can in ſo yonge
a man be lokyd for: I
muſte hūbly requyre
you all good chryſten
readers, to
accepte my
good
wyll, and
take thys worke
in good
worth.
         
      
      
         
            
            Hoc facite in mei commemorationem.
Do ye this in the remembraunce
of me.
            
               AS ofte as
I ſpeke vnto
you of
the worde
of god my
well beloued
bretherne,
& in the meane whyle
cōſyder the ſtate of our tyme,
and condycyon of men: ſo often
I ſorowefully ſygh & am
ſycke, bycauſe I perceyue
(which I am ryght ſory to ſe)
that theſe wordes of ſaynte
Paule,1. Corī. 10 no leſſe trewly then
ſorowfully, may be veryfyed
in vs: we be they, whome
thendes of the worlde is come

to. In whoſe miſerable tyme,
all thoſe thynges now happe
hepyd on in a nothers necke,
whyche our lorde Ieſu Cryſt
the very trewth,Math. 24. Mar. 13. Lucc. 21. both erneſtly
and truely ſhewed ſhold come
in thende of the world. For as
to leue ſpekyng at this tyme,
of the horryble warres & batayls
that be at theſe dayes
thorough out chryſtendome,
ye and amonges them to, whiche
as beyng oure chyefe heddes

alſo of the innumerable cōtagyons
and dedely dyſeaſes

the great peſtilence in Germany,
beſydes the ſharpe and
cruell famine with ſuch other

lyke myſchyefes: who ſeeth
not euydently & vnderſtādes
not, that this is euyn the laſt
ende of the worlde, in whych
as criſte hym ſelfe prophecyed,
Iniquyte hath begonne to
habound, and many mennes

were yt not for ye electes, there
ſhold be no fleſhe ſafe, for as
myche as yf yt were poſſyble,
the choſen people ſelfe y• lyue
now at this daye, myght ſeme
to be ſeduced from the trewe
catholyque fayth of Chryſte:
ſyns now I ſay I ſe, not allonely
nacyon agaynſt nacyon,
realme agaynſte realme,
or houſe agaynſte houſe, but
rue the fathers agaynſt theyr
chylderne, the chylderne agaynſte
theyre fathers, a one

brother wyth great cruelty to
ariſe agaynſt the other. which
thynge ſurely, ye were yt but
for this cauſe greueth me very
myche, for that I perceyue
thoſe clene departed from charyte,
ſtryuynge wythin theym

ſhamefully ragynge eche agaynſt

ſaryes, whyche be not onely
bretherne, as beynge created

of god,Galat. 6. whome (as ſaynte
Paule ſayth) ſyns they be of
one houſholde fayth, oughte
ſpecially to be frēdes, and one
of them gladde to do for a nother

/ who me I ſay Criſte our
lorde & gentyll redemer in ſo
farforth hath exhorted vnto
a mutuall charyte, ſhewing it
as a thynge ſo neceſſary, that
wythout that they can not be
knowen for his dyſcyples, or
by any other meanes then by
that mutual charite,Ioban. 13. decerned
from infydeles, that he ſayth
amongeſt other thynges, I
geue you a newe commaūdement
that you loue on a nother:
& as I haue loued you,
ſo loue you betwen your ſelfs:Ioban. 15.
By this ſhall all men knowe
you be my dyſcyples, yf you
haue loue amongeſt you:
This is my precepte, to loue
eche other as I haue loued
you. And agayn: This I cō
               maunde
you to loue to gether

as my father hath loued me,
ſo haue I loued you: Abyde
you in my loue. But howe loued
Chryſt vs? Surely ſo as
hym ſelfe ſayth, that he loſte
hys lyfe for oure ſake, then
whyche kynde of loue no
man can haue a greater.
            whyche alſo thapoſtles recyteth
almoſte in euery place:1. Cor. 4.
Of whyche trewly ineffable
loue towarde vs (his owne)
he hath left behynde hym an
inſpekable token,Teſſo. 5. teſtymonyall,1. John̄. 3. &. 4.
and perpetual memoryal,
in that he gaue him ſelfe to be
eaten of vs, made therby both
the feaſte and the geſte bothe
twayne. As the prophete Dauid
ſayde:Pſalm. 11. Our moſt mercyfull
& pytyful lord hath made
a remēbraūce of his meruayles,

and hath geuen meate to
theym that dreded hym. For
why our lord Ieſu Cryſt, inſtytutyng
this hygh excellent
& wonderfull holy ſacrament,
gaue fode to thoſe that dreded
hym / and for pytye he had on
vs, lefte that ſacrament vnto
vs, as a memoryall & remembraūce,
not onely of ye offering
of hym ſelf for our ſake vpon
the croſſe, & alſo gaue him ſelf
as meate to all ſuche as worſſhyppe
hym, drede hym, loue
him, & honoured him (as ſaint
Paule ſayth:1. Corī. 11 Do you this as
ofte as you drynke yt in the remembraunce
of me / for as oft
as you ſhall eate thys brede
and drynke of thys cuppe,
you ſhall ſhewe the dethe of
our lorde tyll he come) but alſo

left this bleſſed ſacrament
vnto vs, for a memoryall and
remembraūce of his inſpekable
loue toward vs / by which
loue he was broughte for our
ſakes, to the moſt bitter croſſe
& ſhamfull deth, in whych he
myght be wyth vs as he was
before in y• ſacrament, accordyng
to his own ꝓmiſe where
he ſayth:Math vl timo. And lo I am wyth
you for euer euen to the worldes
ende. whyche all though
yt may be vnderſtanden of ye
maner of preſence, by whyche
he is euer preſent wyth vs by
his powre, grace, and dyuyne
maieſty: yet ſemeth it more
lykely he ment of the ſacramē
               tall
preſence, ſyns hys dyſcyples
knewe well inough he
ſholde neuer be from them as

concernynge the former preſence / but
they were not īlyke
wyſe ſure of hys preſence in
that ſacrament / whyche in ſo
farforth was harde to be byleued
and perceyued,John̄. 6. ye many
of hys dyſcyples went backe
and went no more wyth hym.
And therfore oure ſauyour
Cryſte fyrſt to fulfyll the fygure
of ſcrypture, gaue hym
ſelfe mete to vs.Exod. 16. Surely that
fygure was manna, gyuen
from heuyn to the chylderne
of Iſraell, wyth whyche they
were fedde .xl. yere in deſerte.
Cryſte the interpretour, who
ſayth,John̄. 
                     •
                  . Truely truely I tell
you it was not that Moyſes
gaue you the brede out of heuyn,
but my father gyueth
you the trew brede out of heuyn.

I am the brede of lyfe,
your forefathers hath eatyn
māna in deſerte and be dede:
This is brede deſcendynge
frō heuyn, ſo that who eateth
hereof ſhall not dye. whereby
it well appereth that manna
in deſerte was but a ſhadowe
and fygure of the very māna,
that is to witte, of the body of
Ieſu Cryſt to be gyuen to vs
to eate / ſyth alſo thapoſtell
wryteth that thynge and the
hiſtory thereof,1. Cor. 1
                     •
                  
                but as a figure
of that whyche after was to
be fulfylled. Secondely he
gaue hym ſelf meate vnto vs
to accomplyſſhe in dede that
he promyſed by worde / which
god wold haue ſo ſure and ſo
trewe,Mat. 24 Marc. 12 Luc. 11 John̄. 6 that he ſayth, Heuyn
and erth ſhall paſſe, but not

my wordes. But now Cryſte
promyſed to gyue hys fleſſhe
for oure fode, ſayenge, I am
the lyuely brede whyche am
deſcended frome heuyn. who
eateth of this brede ſhall lyue
for euer. And the brede which
I ſhall gyue, is my fleſſhe for
the lyfe of ye worlde. For why
my fleſſhe in dede is meate, &
my blood is very drynk. who
cateth my fleſſhe and drynketh
my blood, dwelleth ī me
and I in hym. Thyrdely
Cryſt gaue hym ſelfe vnto vs
for meate merueylouſly and
ineffably, to ſhewe vs hys
hygh charyte, by whych both
bodely and goſtely he wolde
be wyth vs perpetually, and
all one wyth vs by incorporaciō,
as it is wont to be in loue.

For by the communion of the
body and blood of oure lorde
Ieſu Cryſte, all we be made
one hole body wyth Cryſte.
Thapoſtell approuynge it &
ſayenge thus,1 Cor. 1
                     •
                  
                The brede that
we breke, is it not the parrycypacyon
of the body of our
lorde? bycauſe we men
                  ••
               y be
but one brede and one body,
all that be partakers of one
brede and one cuppe. And for
thys cauſe, oure lorde Ieſu
Cryſte and onely redemer, to
leue byhynde hym a remembraunce
of hys loue towarde
vs, and by thenſample of the
ſame loue, wold haue vs (that
be hys) not onely loue hym,
but alſo one another, and by
the remēbraunce of hys moſt
bytter deth, gyue hym thankes

togyther / was content to
be preſent wyth vs, thoughe
inuyſybly yet bodely in that
ſacrament / and by that communyon
(as we haue ſayd be
fore) to be all one with vs, &
ſo to leue thys bleſſed ſacrament
of thaulter behynd hym
as a ſure pledge of hys great
loue towarde vs.Iohn̄. 13 Of thys it
was that ſaynt Iohn̄ ſayde,
that at thys laſte holy ſupper
the inſtytucyon of that moſte
bleſſed ſacrament of thaulter
was made for a ſygne of loue
when he ſayth, Before ye feaſt
daye of Eaſter, Ieſus knowynge
yt hys howre was come,
in whyche he ſholde departe
out of thys worlde to hys father,
when he had louyd hys
that were in the worlde, he loued

thē to thende. And after
ſupper & ſo forth. In whych
ſaynt Luke anſweryng with
the other wryteth, that Criſte
in hys laſte ſupper ſayde, I
haue inwardely deſyred to
eate thys paſcall wyth you before
I ſuffer and ſo forth.
            And wythin a lytell whyle after:
And takynge the brede,
he ſayd grace and brake it, &
gaue it to thē ſayenge: This
is my body that ſhall be delyuered
for you. Do you thys
in remembraunce of me. How
in my remembraunce? That
you maye remember howe I
haue loued all you that byleued
in me / who for the greate
loue I bare you, to thentente
I maye be wyth you bodely
to the worldes ende, haue gyuen

you meate, myne owne
body and myne owne blood,
vnder the forme of brede, and
ſo vnder the ſacrament, to the
entēt that there may come in
your myndes ſomtyme, another
greate charyte of myne,
by whych I dowre not to ſuffex
deth for you / whyche deth
and charyte you ought to remember
wyth the rendrynge
of dewe thankes, as ofte as
ye conſecrate and handell by
myne enſāple this ſacrament.
whyche thynge thapoſtell cō
               fyrmynge
ſayth, that Chryſt,
the ſame nyghte he was betrayed,
takynge the brede
and the cuppe, delyuered it
vnto his dyſcyples and ſayd,
Do you this in remembraūce
of me.1. Cor. 11 As ofte as you eate of

thys brede and drinke of this
cuppe, ſhewe you the deth of
our lorde tyll he come and ſo
forth.
            With how fatherly a loue
then Cryſte inſtytuted thys
holy ſacrament of thaulter,
there is no good man that of
theſe wordes of Cryſte, & alſo
of thapoſtell, as well of that
y• goeth before as foloweth,
vnderſtandeth not / ſyns he
harde that oure lorde Ieſu
Cryſte, not onely had ſhewed
in that hys charyte towarde
vs (whych he wolde ſholde be
ꝑpetuall) in that he toke vpō
hym our nature, to make vs
as ſaynt Iohn̄ ſayth men by
partycypacyon,John̄. 1
                     •
                  
                goddes by
fayth, and all he toke of ours
gaue vs agayn for our helth / 

but alſo offered vppe to god
hys father, his owne body on
the croſſe, as a ſacrafyce for
our recōcylyacyon, his blood
to be ſhed as a pryce and laua
tory of our ſynne, that beynge
redemed from the myſerable
ſeruytude, we myghte be clenſed
frome our vyce.
            Wherfore to thentent the remembraunce
of ſo hygh a benefyte
might abyde in vs, and
the greatneſſe of the loue of
god more fyrmely fixed in our
breſtes, in his laſte ſupper as
yt is wryten in the goſpell of
ſaynte Iohn̄,John̄. 13. in the paſcall
made wyth his dyſcyples, at
his departynge oute of thys
worlde to his father, he gaue
his body for meate, and hys
blood for drynke, to be receyued

of faythfull folke vnder
the forme of brede, ordeynyng
this holy ſacrament of thaulter,
as a ꝑpetuall remēbraūce
of hys paſſyon to th

                fulfyllyng
of tholde fygures, & one
of the greateſt myracles that
euer he dyd, as a ſyngulare
comforte of all thoſe that are
ſorowfull for his abſence. As
though he wolde ſay: I ſhall
not leue you fatherles / not for
y• I wyll come agayne to you
my ſelfe, but bycauſe I wyll
be euer wyth you, euen to the
ende of the world by my mercy,
by my grace, by my diuyne

O moſte reuerende. O
moſte worthy prayſe. O moſt
worthy glory, highly to be magnifyed,
to be extolled by worthye
cryers, to be honoured
wyth all the herte, with all deuocyon,
wyth all reuerence.
what more meruaylous then
this ſacramēt, in whych brede
and wyne is veryly cōuerted
into the body and blood of
Ieſu Cryſte / in whyche pertyte
Criſt is conteyned by the
vertue of the word, vnder the
forme and lykenes of a peace
of brede: Take you this is my

Criſten folke, & in the meane
whyle ys not torne / but

though the ſacrament be deuyded,
yet the bodye abydeth
and cōtynueth holevnder euery

O ſo wonderfull a ſacrament
and meruaylous, ſo full
of charyte, that no man can
crye the worthynes of yt better,
then by ye wordes of ſaynt
Paule where he ſayth to the
Romaynes:Rom. 1

                O the depnes of

how inueſtygable his ways?
For who knewe the mynde of

But there be ſome of you that
beleue not / as though he wold
ſay, and therfore vnderſtand
not, and for that cauſe ſhall
go backe, and not walke with
me, when the Iewes ſayde:
Howe can this man geue vs
his fleſhe to eate? This is a
harde ſaynge. And who can
heare hym? And the euangelyſt ſheweth, what Criſt ſayd.
My fleſhe is very meate, and
my blood is very drinke. who
eateth my fleſh and drynketh
my blood, taryeth in me and
I in hym, and ſo forth. From
that tyme many of his dyſcyples
went backe and walked
not wyth hym. Peter anſwerynge

for all the reſte, what
tyme Chryſte demaunded of

from hym to: Good lorde, to
whome ſhall we go? Thou
haſte the worde of theternal
lyfe, and we byleue & knowe,
that thou art Cryſte the ſonne

No ſurely. For I wote that
thou arte he of whome ſcrypture
ſayth:Sapien. 11 Thou haſt mercy
on euery body, bycauſe thou
canſt all, & dyſſymbleſt mans
ſynnys for penaunce.
            Conſyderyng now therfore
my wellbeloued bretherne ye
treuth of ſcrypture / let vs beware
as ſaynt Poule counſayles
vs, that we ſette not at
naughte the rycheſſe of the
goodnes, pacyence, & longe
ſufferaunce of our lord Ieſu
Cryſte, but do penaunce for
our treſpas to hym whome
we haue offended / whoſe gentylnes

(as ſaint Poule ſayth)
draweth vs to penaunce.1. Cor. 11▪
                By
whom truely we ſhall be both
iudgyd and condempned, yf
accordyng to his admonicyō,
we do not iudge ourſelfes.
            Nor lette vs in the meane
whyle ſo folyſſhely flater our
ſelfes wyth the ſufferaunce
of god, as though he wolde
forgete oure ſynne, and as a
iuſte iudge not correcte when
he ſeeth tyme, for our ſo irreuerent
handelynge of ye holy
ſacrament. How be it who
knoweth not theſe cruell peſtylences
that now raygne
thoroughe oute Germanye,
ſykneſſe, diſſenſyons, ſuppreſſyons,
the mynyſſhement of
euery eſtate, calamytees, and
other ſuche lyke kyndes of
euyls almoſte infynyte / and

no leſſe horryble, chyefly to be
caſte vppon vs from god, yf
at the leſt way we byleue ſaīt
Poule (as we veryly muſte)
for the vnworthy and ſhamefull
handelynge of thys holy
ſacrament of thaulter.1. Cor. 11 And
go me thorough out Germany,
and as full as that nacion
(whyche was of late very deuout
and relygyouſe) is now
of all myſchyefe and ſynne:
yet is there none therin greater
then thys. And ſurely vnleſſe
we leue thys ſo horryble
a wyckedneſſe, we ſhalbe ſure
of the greate ſtroke of god, ye
and that more then men can
tell of. For in god (as ſaynte
Peter wryteth) neyther is
there none,1. Petr. 2 nor neuer ſhall be
any lacke of powre, but he
can delyuer good men out of

theyr tēptaciō, and euyll men
can he reſerue to euerlaſtyng
punyſſhement. In whych nū
               ber
to thentēt we may not be,
it ſhalbe nedefull and expedyent
we leue ſo ſhamefull handelyng
of thys holy ſacramēt
of thaulter, doyng penaunce,
for that is paſt which I truſt
to god we will / and that after
we haue proued ourſelfes (as
ſaynt Poule wolde we ſhold)
we wyll I truſte eate of that
brede, that is to wyt the body
of our lord in forme of brede.
And when we haue decernyd
the body of our lorde frome
other meate, then maye we
worthyly receyue it.
            To the whych yt is requyſyte
that fyrſt we ſhold byleue
the playne worde of Cryſte:
This is my body, whych ſhal

be delyuered for you on the
croſſe (as theuāgelyſtes with
one accorde wryteth) demaundynge
no reaſon thereof,Mat. 26 aſkyng
no queſtyons as the vnbyleuynge
Iewes dyd,Mar. 14 Howe
can this mā geue vs his fleſh
to eate?Iuc. 22 This is a hard ſaing.John̄. 6
And who can heare hym?1. Cor. 11. as
the ſcyſmatyques ſayde: To
them that wyll denye yt and
aſke this queſtyon of vs, how
can there be the body of Cryſt
vnder the forme of brede? and
ſo forth. How can we anſwere
thē better then wyth ye ſayeng
of Eſaias.Ezaie. 7. If you byleue not,
you ſhall not vnderſtande.Hebre. 11
And bycauſe all thynges be
poſſyble to hym that byleueth
Cryſte, who cometh to god
muſt byleue.Iohan. 20. For Cryſte hym
ſelfe ſayde to ſaynt Thomas

of Inde: Be not vnfaythful
but byleue, Bleſſed be they
that haue byleued & ſaw not.
That we comprehēde not by
wyt, that we ſe not at eye / let
vs byleue, beſydes the comen
order of nature. why honour
we not Chryſte that ſuffered
for vs, in that, ſacrament of
thaulter? ſyns tyll this oure
of all as many as be & haue
ben, there is none that hath
brought any thynge forth to
proue, that we ought or may
departe from that fayth, whyche
the hole catholyke chyrch,
ſo longe agon hath kepte and
approued, whyche the euangelyſtes
& apoſtles wrytynge
ſo euydently reache, ſhewyng
wyth one cōſent & agrement,
that Cryſte ſayd: This is my
body that is geuyn for you.

Agaynſt which there is not ſo
myche as one tyttell of ſcrypture,
y• ſheweth in any place
manyfeſtly the cōtrary herof,
or ſayth that there is not ye bodye
of our lorde Ieſu Cryſte.
It is alſo very agreable vnto
the ineffable loue of god towarde
man kynde, that thoſe
whome he had redemed wyth
this precyouſe blood & bodye
of his ſonne, he wold alſo by a
certayne inſpekable meanys,
fede thē with his fleſh, blood &
body, & ſo to be ꝯforted by this
ſecrete preſence of his ſonne,
as by a plegge, tyll he ſholde
come gloriouſely in the ſyght
of all the worlde.
            God forbede it therfore we
ſhold gyue any place at all to
all theſe folyſſhe ſophiſtycall
ſutteltyes brought agaynſte

this ſacramēt, which argumē
               tes
we haue cōfuted before, by
hole & ſounde reaſons of holy
ſcripture / which were ſuch as
neuer none yet hytherto, were
able to impugne, ye the leſte
part of them / ſyns there is nothyng
ſtrōger then truth, and
alſo this is ye fayth, that euer
hath ye ouer hand, & by which
all thinges (as Cryſt hym ſelf
ſayth) be poſſyble.1. John̄. 5 wherby I
am more ledde to byleue one
word of the prophete, y• ſaith,
He ſayd the worde and it was
done,Pſal. 32. &. 148. then all ye colored crafty
ſuttyll argumētes or opiniōs
of Aryſtotell, Plato, other
phyloſophers, or heretykes.
So mych before all ye reaſōs
& prynciples that euer coulde
be brought, p̄fere we this wordes,
Hoc eſt corpus meū, Thys is

my body. Nor it is not lefull
that any reaſon of man ſhold
be preferred before the worde
of god, for as myche as ſaynt
Peter ſaith,Actu. 5. we ought more to
byleue ī god & obay him, then
men. Nor this obieccyon can
not ſtāde, if one ſhuld ſay, that
Cryſte ſytteth in heuen on the
right hande of his father, nor
wyll not be with vs tyll tyme
he come to iudge in ye daye of
iudgemēt, For I wil anſwere
here vnto yt he yt is euery wher
& euer, with whom nothing is
impoſſible, may be gloriouſly
with his father in heuē, & ſhal
come in a vyſyble body to iudge,
& both nowe is wyth vs &
ſhalbe with vs (as hym ſelfe
ſayth) euen to thende of the
world / not in no viſible body,Mat. 82
but in ye ſacramēt, ī the forme

of brede. And alſo let theſe
heretykes tell vs howe this
may be, y• Cryſte ſholde be veryly
here with vs on erth, and
yet hym ſelfe veryly in heuen.
For yt he ſo was in dede, hymſelf
witneſſeth where he ſaith:
No man aſcendeth vnto heuē
but he yt hath deſcended out of
heuen, the ſonne of man why
che is in heuen. If they byleue
this why notyt? What & they by
leue neyther nother? ye, what
& they byleue nothyng at all?
as we may eaſely perceyue by
theyr frutes they do not.
            Nor agayn this reaſon can
not hold that yt ſemeth a ieſtynge
ſtocke & a folyſhnes, to
byleue that Cryſte can be or
ought to be vnder the forme
of a litle piece of brede, & there
to be hyd & conteyned / & then

ſay farther that yt profyteth
nothynge and ſo forth.
            I wold anſwere yf they wold
ſo ſay, that they nothyng dyffer,
neyther from the vnbyleuyng
Iews nor yet reprobate
Paynyms that were before
tyme. For by this meanes
they nother ſhall nor can, beleue
any poynt of the catholy
like faith, for as mych as ſaīt
Paule ſayth:1. Cor. 1. Nole Cryſte is
crucyfyed, that is to ſay all ye
hole fayth of Cryſte / & euery
worde of hys, is occaſyon of
ruyne to the Iewes, & amongeſt
the paynyms takē for very
folly. who was I praye
you more mocked at, thē ſaint
Poule, when he taught the reſurreccyon
of Criſte & of dede
folke. were not the Iews offended
in Cryſte, reprouynge

him of folly, when he ſaid himſelfe
was brede & meate from
heuyn, when they murmured
amonges them ſelfes & ſayd:
Is not this the ſonne of Ioſeph,
whoſe father & mother
we knewe? Now then ſayth
he, that I am deſcended from
heuen? for they thoughte yt
but a folyſhe thynge to byleue
god incarnate, or to byleue
yt poſſyble for any that
deſcēdeth from heuen to erth,
myght be at the ſame ſelf momēt
in heuen ſtyll to. Trewly
ſaynt Paule ſayth:1. Corī 
                  
                     •
                  
                The word
of the croſſe to them yt ſhall peryſhe
is but folyſhnes / but to
them yt ſhal be ſafe, yt is to wyt
to byleuers, yt is the powre of
god. wherfore we may lightly
gather, that we muſte byleue
this very bare word of god in

which he ſayd, This is my body
y• is delyuered for you: Do
you this ī ye remēbraūce of me.
Secūdly yf we wyll receyue
the body of our lord worthely
we ought in the receyuyng &
doyng, remēber that merueylous
great loue of his toward
vs, by ye whych for our ſakes
he delyuered vp his body on
thaulter of ye croſſe / after whiche
alſo he gaue hym ſelf in ye
ſacrament for vs as a ſpyrytuall
mete to eate, as a pledge
& teſtymonyall of hys loue toward
vs / as though vouchſafynge
by the cōmunyon of
that ſelf ſame ſacramēt, to be
incorporate & all one thynge
with vs, by beyng partakers
of his bleſſed body. whyche
euydentely appereth by ſaynt
Poule to ye Corinthies,1. Corī. 10 where

he ſayth: The brede that we
breke is it not ye partycipaciō
or to be parteyner of the body
of our lorde? for the brede is
one, & all we that be ꝑteyners
of that one brede & that one
cuppe, beynge menny, be all
one body. And in good fayth
it is not mych agaynſt reaſon
to byleue in thys ſo noble a
ſacrament, that Cryſte was
harde of his father a lytell before,
when he prayde in thys
wyſe: I do not onely pray for
them, but alſo for all ſuche as
ſhall beleue in me by theyr
prechyng, that all may be one
as thou my father arte in me
and I in the, that they maye
be all one in vs, I in theym &
thou in me, that they maye be
made one, that the world may
know that thou haſt ſent me,

and haſt loued them as thou
haſt louyd me. But I praye
you, thys vnyte and ſo wonderful
a loue of the ſonne and
the father toward vs, of what
(yf the wordes of thapoſtle be
well wayed) ſhall it be rather
vnderſtāden, then in the partycypacyon
or beynge partener
of thys ſacrament, where
is the body and blood of our
lorde. wherof thyrdely it foloweth
to the receyuyng of it
worthyly, that we muſte kepe
the treuth at the receuynge,
whych (as ſaynt Poule wryteth)
is marked vnto vs as a
fygure and a ſhadowe.
            Fyrſte yf we wyll receyue
it worthyly, let vs be gyrdyd
vp, that is to ſaye, by chaſtyte
of mynde and body. Secūdly
hold ſtaues in our handes / yt
               
is to wytte, we muſte haue a
ſure fayth. Thyrdely ſtande
vpryght not inclynynge now
agayn to vice & the fylthynes
of ſynne, from whyche we be
ryſen by confeſſyon and contrycyon.
Fourthly not eate
thys immaculate lambe ſode
in water & bytter lettuſe, but
roſt it wyth fyre, that is to ſay
wyth bytter contricyō for our
treſpas, and fyry cheryte.
            Fyftly putte on ſhowes on
our fete / wherby is ment we
muſte kepe the affeccyons of
our herte frō fleſhely deſyres,
& compel them to ſerue for the
loue of our lorde Ieſu Criſte,
auoydyng all that is cōtrary
to him, doyng that may pleaſe
hym, and after the counſell of
ſaynt John̄, not louyng hym
alonely by word & tonge,
                  
                     •
                  . Iohn̄. 
                     •
                  
                but

in dede & trewth / as hym ſelfe
hath loued vs which dyed for
our ſake, leuyng behynd him
to vs this bleſſed ſacramēt as
a remēbraūce of his loue whē
he ſaith: Take you this is my
bodye that is geuen for you:
Do you this in ye remēbraūce
of me, that is to ſaye, remembring
how I haue loued you,
whyche dyenge for you, was
cōtōt to be made alſo for you,
mete, the feaſte, and the geſt
to gether.
