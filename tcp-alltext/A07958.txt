               To the Right woorshipful, SIR EDWARD PARHAM Knight, Seriant Major of the Regiment of the Right honorable The LORD VAVX, in the ſeruice of the King of Spayn in the Netherlandes.
            
               IN my late paſsage down from London to Graueſend by Tiltboat, there chanced among others, two gentlemen at that preſent alſo to pas, beeing both of millitarie profeſſion, but differently diſpoſed in their determinations touching the ſides they went to ſerue on, for after ſome

courſe of ſpeech that paſſed among the compagnie: the one diſcouered his intentiō to go ouer into the Netherlandes to ſerue the King of Spayn, and the other manifeſted his purpoſe to go to ſerue the States of Holland, but becauſe each of them ſeemed fortifyed with reaſon for his determination, and to think himſelf as wel able to defend it as hee ſeemed willing to follow it, all the compagnie out of a curioſitie weare verie deſyrous to heare what by either could be ſayd, but yet with a prouiſo that no inconvenience or falling out between them vpon it might erſue, and therefore they deſyred them, that before they

began ſeriouſly to argue the matter, they ſhould pas their woordes to each other vpon their honors, that without iniurying one another in particular, each might haue his free ſpeech, in defence of his own determined cours, & that their argunig beeing ended, their ſhould no exceptions be taken, either by them or anie of the compagnie, for oght that had bin ſpoken, but that both they & all the reſt of the compagnie (their diſcours beeing ended) ſhould in ciuil and courteous manner carrie themſelues, & ſo take their leaues of each other, when their wayes lay to bee ſeperated.
            To this all agreed, and theſe

twdyn gaue each other their handes, vpon the conditions, & there vpon began between them a Toung-combat, wherein neither of both were ſlayn or maymed, and becauſe it may bee ſome recreation vnto you to vnderſtand how the matter paſſed, I thoght good now at my ſooneſt leaſure, & as wel as my memorie would permitt mee, to penne it down, & to preſent it vnto your view, to whome I hold my beſt endeuours obliged, & thus kiſsing your handes I take my leaue, wiſhing vnto you the atchyving of all honor, anſwerable vnto your noble valour and courage.

               BECAVSE the enſuing diſcours is dialogue wyſe, & that ſome note of diſtinction muſt of neceſsitie be vſed; ſeeing I know not theſe gentlemennes names: I haue th

                good to note them by their ſcarfs, as by calling him that was to go to ſerue the King of Spayn by the name of Red-ſcarf, according to the colour of the ſcarf hee wore, & to call the other by the name of Tawney-ſcarf, becauſe he wore a ſcarf of the colour of Orange-tawney.
            The compagnie, after the conditions of quietnes at parting were agreed vpō, became all ſilent, to heare them begin, The firſt then (beeing Tawney-ſcarf) began in this manner.
            IT ſeemeth ſtrange vnto mee, that anie of our Countrimen ſhould rather reſolue

to ſerue the King of Spayn, then thee States of Holland, conſidering how long their cauſe & quarrel had bin by Engliſhmen ſupported, and the number of our Countrimen that continew to ſerue on that ſyde.
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               It ſemeth as ſtrange vnto mee that men of ſence and vnderſtanding, ſhould not rather regard the iuſtnes of the cauſe & quarrel which they are to def
                     •
                  d (eſpecially when they are not conſtrayned, but that their reſolution lyeth in their owne choyſe) then to let themſelues bee blyndfolded & led forward by ſiniſter ſuggeſtion, to follow the vn vnderſtanding vulgar multitude for companie or cuſtome ſake, becauſe they haue continued ſo long a tyme to ſerue on that ſyde, without knowing or caring wherein right or wrong cōſiſteth.
            
            
               Tawney-ſcarf.
               You muſt not think that the firſt reſolution taken for the aſsiſtance of the

Hollanders was without good conſideration of the iuſtnes of their cauſe, and the ſame beeing once begun and continued, what needed further doubt or ſcruple bee made thereof by the after-followers of it?
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               Becauſe it is no article of faith, to belieue that the firſt reſolution taken in England for the aſsiſting of the Hollanders; was not without good conſideration of the iuſtnes of their cauſe, diuers haue ſince penetrated further in to it, to ſee whether it ſo were or not, but could not ſo fynd it, & therefore thoſe you ſpeak of, that haue followed it without ſcruple, haue bin people that were not ſcrupulus at all, for there is no cauſe bee it neuer ſo bad, but ſome will bee found without anie ſcruple willing to follow it.
            
            
               Tawney ſcarf.
               I know their are ſome that are redie enough to embrace the folowing of bad courſes, but what cōcernes that this?
            
            
               
               Red-ſcarf.
               If the cauſe of the Hollanders by anie vndiſprooueable reaſons of yours ſhall appeer vnto mee to bee iuſt, I ſhal not onlie bee ſorrie for myn error in not apprehending it ſo to bee, but reſolue to go along with your ſelf vnto their ſeruice.
            
            
               Tawney-ſcarf.
               I am glad to heare you ſpeak ſo, & therefore I wil endeuour to giue you ſatisfactiō in hope of the having of your good compagnie.
               Three cauſes I conceaue to haue bin the motyues why Queen Elizabeth did firſt vndergo her aſsiſting the Hollanders.
               The firſt was, their beeing opreſſed and wronged by the King of Spayn, and in danger to bee broght vnder the ſeueritie, of the Spaniſh inquiſition.
               The ſecond was in regard they were our ſo neer aioyning freindes & neyghbours.
               
                  
And the third and that not the leaſt, was for the maintenāce of the Ghoſpel.
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               You haue heer alleadged ſundrie reaſons to haue cauſed Queen Elizabeth to take the Hollanders partes, it is reaſon then that If ſo bee I cannot allow them for ſufficient reaſons, I prooue them not ſo to bee, which by your patience & permiſsion, I think I ſhalbe able to do.
               The firſt point is about their beeing oppreſſed and wronged by the King of Spayn, and in danger to bee broght vnder the ſeueritie of a Spaniſh inquiſition.
               That theſe people lyued in obedience of King Phillip the ſecond of Spayn▪
                   as did all the other inhabitants of the ſeuenteen Netherland Prouinces, acknowledging him as their true & lawfull Soueraigne Lord, as they had acknowledged his anceters before him from whome hee ſucceſsyuely inherited thoſe countries, no man can make anie doubt or queſtiō, The queſtion then is whether this King

when he came to the poſſeſsiō of theſe countries, did impoſe vpon the people anie preſſures more then his former anceſters had donne, but who is able to ſhew that he did? The ſayd King beeing then in as full and quiet poſſeſsion of all thoſe countries as euer anie of his anceſters had bin, & departing from thence towards Spayn in the yeare 1559. hee left none of his Netherland ſubiects for anie cauſe of innouation, in anie thing, anie whit diſguſted, but in as great tranquilitie as euer they had bin, Hee left behind him in thoſe countries no Spaniſh Gouernours nor Soldiers, but gaue the particular gouernments to the nobilitie of the countrie it ſelf, and the generall Gouernment of them all, vnto his naturall ſiſter the Ducheſſe of Parma, beeing of the ſame countrie borne, what wrong in anie reſpect was heer donne them? who complayned of anie wrong? why was not the good peace and reciprocall loue between this King

and his Netherland ſubiects continued? who began the breach? what actions of innouation cauſed it? proceeded it from this Prince or from the Netherland people?
               When no thoght nor cogitation was in this Kinges mynd of anie breach between him and his ſubiects, in the yeare of our Lord 1566. certayn of the raſcalitie beeing ſuggeſted by ſeditious preachers, & thoſe preachers ſet on by ſome of nobillitie litle better then bankrupt, they begā in moſte rebellious rage to fall to the robbing and ſpoyling of Churches, The Ducheſſe of Parma beeing at Bruxelles when the newes of his outragious and generall ſacrilegious theft, was broght vnto her, was much amaſed there at, and demaunded of the Earle of Barlamont, (who then was preſent) what they were that had donne this, where vnto he anſwered her in French, Ce ne ſont que de Geus, which is aſmuch to ſay in Engliſh They are but rogues, or raſcalles.
                  
The Churche robbers and thoſe that ſet them on woork, whereof ſome were gentlemen (thogh much vnwoorthie of that title) having gotten knowlege how the name of Geus was giuen them, did foorth-with accept of the name, and wore in ſtede of brooches on their hattes litle wodden diſhes, to betoken beggers diſhes, & ſome of that ſorte did afterward weare fox-tayles in their hattes in ſteed of fethers, ſo as it ſeemeth they took a glorie in this woorthie name, for they alſo cauſed a print or ſtāp of a cock to bee made, at whoſe mouth the wordes, Viue les Geus par tout le monde, were ſet down, which is aſmuch to ſay, as Liue or florish may the rogues ouer all the world, & the paper printes or pictures takē from this ſtamp, were ſet vp in all howſes, taphowſes and tauernes, where they frequented, heer hence it cometh that in all the low countries this kynd of people do vnto this day beare the name of Geuſes, howbeit they haue ſince

bin taught to call themſelues The Reformed, but proteſtants they neither do, or euer did call themſelues.
               Heer haue you the originall and begining of the breach between the King of Spayn, & theſe his Netherlād ſubiects. And as touching their beeing oppreſſed and wronged by the King of Spayn, and in danger to bee brought vnder the ſeueritie of the Spaniſh inquiſitiō. The blame that the King of Spayn heerin deſerueth, is, that hee was ſo much ouer ſhot that when hee heard of their breaking down of Alters, & Images in Churches, of their robbing and carying thence of ſiluer Chalices, patrens, cruets, candleſticks, lamps, & reliquaries, with the tapiſtrie, and whatſoeuer they might make monie of, euen to the verie belles in the ſteeples, he had not comended it to be wel donne, and ſent them rewardes for ſo dooing, & ſo haue let them runne on euē to the taking of the crucifix out of the Churche, and hanging it

on the gallowes as they did at Gorcum in Holland, an acte that albeit the diuel, Iewes, and Geuſes, could take pleaſure in, yet would verie Turcks and Mahometanes be ſcandalized to behold it.
               Now becauſe the King of Spayn had ſworne at his beeing in the Netherlandes; to defend the Churche and Eccleſiaſtical perſons in their ancient & Chriſtian priuileges, and that hee apprehended Churche-robberie to be theft, he ſo much wronged theſe people as to ſend the Duke of Alua to puniſh this theft, which as I take it, was as litle wrong as to hang a miniſter for ſtealing of a book of Martirs out of a Pariſh Churche in London.
            
            
               Tawney-ſcarf.
               You haue heer ſayd ſomthing, but the Duke of Alua was not ſatisfyed with the hanging and puniſhing of a number of theſe, but hee ſoght to haue broght in and intruded vpon them the Tirannons inquiſition of Spayn, which was a meer

innouation, & ſuch as the priuileges of the countrie could not beare.
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               The Duke of Alua had neuer charge from Spayn nor neuer intention of his own, to bring an inquiſition into the Netherlandes, this is but a meer calumnie, which hath bin giuen out & ſpred abrode hy the ſeditious, to foſter the obſtinatie of the people, But had the inquiſition bin broght into the Netherlandes, it had but returned from whence in long fore going yeares it came, for you muſt note that the inquiſition was neuer invented or broght vp in Spayn, or there euer intended for Proteſtants, ſeeing it was in the world manie ages before euer the world was acquainted with the name of Proteſtants, or with anie ſuch kynde of people as Proteſtants are, for the Emperor Charles the great who liued about 800. yeares paſt, did firſt promulgate and put it in practiſe, and the cauſe was, that after the Saxons in their

countrie of Saxonie, (Holland, and thoſe annexed prouinces, beeing at that tyme partes of the Nether Saxonie) had bin brought from Paganiſme to Chriſtianitie, this pious Emperor having greatly furthered it, hee had no ſoouer turned his back by reaſon of his beeing empeached with warres in other partes, but theſe Saxons turned from Chriſtianitie back agayn to paganiſme, and for ſuch Apoſtataes and forſakers of the faith hee ordayned an inquiſition, the memorie whereof gaue example that ſome ages after it was renewed and put in practiſe in Spayn, for ſuch moores & Iewes, as having receaued the character of Chriſte fel back agayn to Mathometiſme, and Indaiſme, and albeit this inquiſition was neuer intended (as before is ſayd) to haue bin renewed in the Netherlandes, yet paraduenture it might haue prooued as neceſſarie when ſignes appeered of the good diſpoſition of ſome there, aſwel to Mahometiſme, as to Iudaiſme, for diuers

that are yet lyving haue ſeene written vpon the targets or rondaſſes which ſome of theſe Geus gallants did beare, their reſolution there vnto, in theſe woordes, Rather Turkish, then Popish, which is in effect, rather Mahomet thē Chriſte, and Hollanders reporte themſelues that ſome of their countrimen haue bin ſo edified in the preſent Synagogue of Amſterdam, that they haue relinquiſhed their Chriſtianitie & are become lewes, & for defect of an inquiſition had not anie thing ſayd vnto thē for it, nor muſt they where profeſsion is made of ſuch cōſcience libertie, that euerie man may chuſe what hee wil belieue, or whether hee will belieue anie thing or nothing. But this may ſeeme the leſſe wonder, whēthere haue bin found among theſe geuſes, a companie that marched vnder the enſigne of the deuil, for ſo was the enſigne called, becauſe there were depicted therein the Diuelles clawes, which ma

                  ie that are yet lyving haue

ſeene diſplayed in the town of Liere in Brabant, at ſuch tyme as it ſtood out in rebellion againſt the King, & ſo may you now ſee how rebellion againſt the king, & rebellion againſt God, do concurre toge ther, for where as ancient good Chriſtians having bin taught by the example of the moſte glorious Chriſtian Emperor Conſtantinus Magnus, to fight vnder the ſigne of the Croſſe, theſe new contrarie Chriſtians, abhorring that ſigne, haue more deuotion to the clawes of the deuill, a well deuyſed and befitting enſigne for ſuch as foght vnder it.
            
            
               Tawncy-ſcarf.
               I wote well there is in Holland free libertie of conſcience allowed to all, and free exerciſe of Religion allowed to ſome, but of anie their enclyning to Mahometiſme or to Iudaiſme, or of their marching vnder the deuilles clawes, haue I not heard.
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               Where free libertie of conſcience is

allowed, why may not euerie one belieue as him liſt? what ſhal reſtrayn him? If you doubt of the Hollanders making difficultie of turning Turckes, do but enquire what they haue don at Tunis where they haue fal

                  e to Mahometiſme by whole ſhipfulls at once, and afterward to mend the matter haue taught the Mahometanes of thoſe partes, the laudable ſcience of Piracie, for the more affliction of Chriſtians, and as for Iudaiſme, ſuch as lyke there of and lyke no ſwynes fleſh▪ or can bee content to forbeare the eating thereof may bee circumciſed when they wil, and then ſpeak as much blaſphemie againſt Chriſt as the devil wil direct them to do.
               Thus haue I heer ſhewed you, what great wrong the King of Spayn hath donne this people, and what great cauſe they haue to complayn of his breach of their priuileges, which is alwaycs in their mouthes, albeit they would neuer vouchſaſe to produce anie one old priuilege

for the robbing of Churches.
               I haue alſo ſhewed you where the inquiſition began, and the cauſe why it was firſt put in practiſe in Saxonie, & afterward in Spayn, the name whereof is now aſmuch put in practiſe in Holland, in continuall pamphlets & preachings, as is the name of a Bulbegger to make litle children afrayd.
            
            
               Tawney-ſcarf.
               Theſe bee thinges I haue not to do withal.
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               But theſe bee thinges that belong to the purpoſe, heer to bee alleaged.
            
            
               Tawney-ſcarf.
               The Hollanders were and are, our neer neyghbours & freindes, and therefore Queen Elizabeth ſaw great reaſon to vphold them, againſt her potent enemie the King of Spayn.
               
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               Before I come to diſcours about Queen Elizabeths reaſon for taking the

Hollanders partes giue mee leaue I pray you to ſpeak a litle of the blynd ignorance of our vulgar multitude heer in England, to the end you may conſider of the reaſōs why they hate the Spagniard, & loue the Hollander, to ſee how well & wiſely this loue & hatred is founded.
               That England and Spayn haue anciently remayned in great amitie together Hiſtories & Chronicles wil witnes, and the diuers alliances and mariages often made between thoſe two countries, can alſo giue teſtimonie thereof. True then it is, that the great breach and hoſtillitie between England and Spayn began but in theſe our dayes, let vs now ſee & conſider why & how it began, to wit, whether by Spayn or by England.
               
               King Phillip the ſecond of Spayn as all the world knoweth, did vpon the death of Queen Marie his wyf, giue place and quiet entrance vnto Queen Elizabeth, & for further proof of his deſyre of continuance of peace and amitie with her hee

freely gaue vnto her all Queen Maries Iewelles, they iuſtly belonging vnto himſelf, hee alſo kept his Ambaſſador lidger in England; as the ſayd Queen kept hers alſo in Spayn, profeising out wardly vnto him all loue and amitie, and yet this not-withſtanding, ſhee permitted ſecretly and vnderhand, the tranſporte of Artillerie and Munition of warre to the Moores of Granado to enable them to rebel, iuſt about the verie ſame tyme that the Netherland rebellion was determined to bee begun, that thereby thee King of Spayn might haue his handes full, by beeing thruſt in-to two warres at once, both which ſhee vnderhand furthered, but more the warre of the Netherlandes then that of Granado, becauſe of the redier comoditie. Soon vpon the contryving of this plot, when the King of Spayn to appeaſe the Netherland broyles in the beginning, had ſent the Duke of Alua with forces into thoſe

partes, and after his arryuall there, ſent him a ſupply of 600000 crownes, ſome affirme it to haue bin 800000. ſhee ceazed vpon this monie in the weſt parte of England, and having gotten it into her handes, did therewith aſsiſt his Netherland Rebelles, whereby his monie ordayned to haue ſerued himſelf againſt his rebelles, came to ſerue his rebelles againſt him, and bred beſydes this a farre greater inconvenience, for it was the cauſe why the Duke of Alua demaunded the tenth pennie of the countrie peoples goodes, whereby they became the more alienated and apt to rebellion.
               Some yeares after this; Captayn Drake was employed from England to the weſt-Indies, where hee robbed the King of Spayn of about a million and a half, of his treaſure, Theſe and ſundrie other wronges and detriments were donne by the ſayd Queen vnto the King of Spayn at ſuch tyme as either had their

Ambaſſadors (the Miniſters of peace) in each others countrie, they profeſsing to each other, loue and amitie. The King of Spayn dooing againſt the Queen of England, no acte whatſoeuer to the contrarie, whereas ſhe contrariwiſe continued to do againſt him vnderhand as manie wronges as ſhe could, beſydes thoſe great notorious wronges heere mentioned, But when theſe grew ſo frequent that the ſmart vnto the King of Spayn became intollerable, and ſo manifeſted vnto the world that all other Princes and people took notice thereof, how was it poſsible that it could ſtand with the honor of a King, and of ſuch a potent King▪ as is a King of Spayn, ſtil to continew to put vp wronges as faſt as ſhee continued to do them? hee was therefore at the laſt moued to the preparation of his great Armada naual▪ of the yeare of our Lord 1588. the memorie whereof by the inceſſant clamours of Puritanical enemyes of peace▪
                  
hath poſſeſſed more place in the heades of the inconſiderate vulgar multitude, then the manie great wronges that enforced it
               But thankes bee vnto God, our peacefull King Iames coming to the crown, and wel knowing how matters had paſſed, did to the great happynes of the Realme ſalue vp this ſore▪ from further feſtering, wherevnto hee found Spayn moſt redie and willing, and wel content to let pas and forget all Engliſh iniuries, for to giue the Spagniaerds their due, certayn it is, they are men▪ that are not of vnreconciliable & revengefull natures, nor ſuch long entertayners of deſyre of reuenge, as ſome other nations are ſayd to bee, And this appeereth manifeſtly in this nation more thē in others, for notwith▪ſtanding all fore going hoſtillitie between Engliſhmen and Spagniards, both by ſea and land, and enuaſions euen in Portugall and Spayn it ſelf, whereof people may remayn

more ſenſible then of an vnefectuall Armada, yet hath not anie Engliſh Ambaſſador or anie other of the Engliſh nation bin by Spagniards in Spayn barbarouſly abuſed, but I am aſhamed euen for the honor of our nation to repeat how Spaniſh Ambaſſadors, and other Spagniardes, haue bin vſed in England.
               
               As for the ſundrie benefits which the commerce and traficque between England and Spayn hath broght vnto our countrie, and nation, I doubt not but manie of our marchants, ſeafaring men, and others, wil confeſſe, and farre more profit and benefit wil no doubt enſue the moſte honorable and great alliance now expected.
               But let vs come to our good neyghbours and friendes the Hollanders, and conſider of the gratefull goodnes and benefits which wee reap by them, that thereby wee may know how wel and wyſely wee are aduyſed to eſteem

them for our good Neyghbours and friendes, and ſo friendly ſticking vnto them.
               That wee haue for aboue theſe fiftie yeares taken their partes, is ſufficiently known, that the people of England haue often tymes generally ſmarted by the great preſſures and parlamental payments impoſed vpon them by Queen Elizabeth, to vphold theſe friendes and neyghbours withall, is lykewiſe wel enough known, as alſo that great boundance of Engliſh blood hath bin ſhed in their quarrel; & an infinite number of Engliſhmennes lyues loſt, whoſe courage and valour, was woorthie of more honor then in their baſe and diſhonorable ſeruice could bee deſerued, and now when all comes to all, they are ſo farre from honeſt ciuillitie, that they will not acknowledge anie friendſhip donne them, and therefore can they not entertayn

anie thoghts of obligation, or gratitude, nay they dare playnly tel vs; that wee are beholding vnto them, which is aſmuch to ſay as that they expect gratitude at our handes.
            
            
               Tawney ſcarf.
               In deed I muſt confeſſe I haue heard them affirme that our aſsiſting them was to free our ſelues from warre in our own countrie, by meanes of Spaniſh enuaſiō, which may carrie ſome reaſō.
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               But what reaſon was there, why wee ſhould haue anie feare of Spaniſh enuaſion, then onlie for our taking their partes, againſt their true and lawfull Soueraigne the King of Spayn.

               But I muſt tel you further, that they do not onlie deny all gratitude where it

is due, and vniuſtly claym it, where they ow it, but paſsing further beyond the limits of reaſon and humanitie; they diſcouer themſelues to bee ſuch monſters, as to beare a verie diuelliſh hatred both vnto our nation and to our moſte gratious Soueraigne himſelf. Againſt our natiō their actious declare it, againſt our Soueraigne their vilanous tounges.
               Of their moſte vile and contemptible vſage of our nation in the Eaſt-Indies I ſhal not heer need to ſpeak, the letters written by our marchants and others from thence do declare it; Their vſage of vs in Groon-land, and the vndooing of our long continued trade in Muſcouie I wil alſo omitt, but wee fynd that they are the verie caterpillers and deſroyers of our comon welth, by all the wayes and meanes they can deuiſe, for they haue not onlie, by meanes of their coreſpondent countriemen, conueyed and drawn by ſtelth our gold and ſiluer out of the Realme, but they haue broght the

whole Realme in a generall decay of traficque, to the empoueriſhing and vndooing of thow ſandes of the inhabitāts, as all that deal in clothing in all partes of the Realme wil confeſſe.
               As for their vilanous ſpeeches againſt our Soueraigne, I could name vnto you that Engliſhman who paſsing not long ſince between Rotterdam and the Hage, and hearing ſome of thoſe varlets ſpeake il of his Maieſtie, which hee beeing an Engliſhmā could not endure, hee as it became him, did in good manner reprehend them for it, but ſtraight-wayes a couple of them drew their knyues vpon him to haue ſtabbed him, and ſo had they donne, had they not bin hild & kept back by others there preſent, wee haue a proverb, that it is better for ſome to ſteal a hors then ſome to look on. What detriments endure wee by Spagniards? where do they bynd vs hand and foot, and caſt vs ouer Indian rockes lyke dogges? Where vndo they

our trade? how empoueriſh they our countrie? where raile they vpon our Soueraigne? Are wee in our right wittes I wonder? when wee reſolue to go to ſhed our blood for thoſe that ſuck our blood? when wee fight for thoſe at home, that kil vs abroad, mee thinks purging with Heleborus were fitter now a dayes to bee taken in vſe of our countrimē, then the ſmoak-drinck of driueling Tobacco.

               For Godes loue lets haue no more of this, leaſt you driue mee in a deſperate mood to turne Spaniſh with you, and ſo diſcredit my ſelf with my friendes that expect mee in Holland.
               
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               Nay Sir, you ſhould by your ſo dooing, giue a good enſample for thoſe friends to follow.
            
            
               Tawney-ſcarf.
               I haue ſerued ſome yeares alredie in Holland, and haue paſt my woord and

promis to ſome friends of myn there to return back vnto them agayn, to the ſeruice of the States.
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               I could then wiſh that both you and they would reſolue to ſerue them as they oght to bee ſerued, ſuch tricks I meane as might revenge ſome of the vilanies and wronges they haue offred vs.
            
            
               Tawney-ſcarf.
               I geſſe at your meaning, but it concurres not with my reſolution, & you know theare is a precept that willeth to do good for evil.
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               That is wel donne where evil is thereby amended, but your dooing good where you do it, makes evil become woors. But let mee now returne to ſpeak ſomthing of Queen Elizabethes reaſon to take the Hollanders partes, And firſt I muſt tel you that Queen Elizabeth did neuer take their partes vpon compaſsion of their cauſe, in regard of anie

wrong which ſhee knew the King of Spayn to do them, for ſhee could not but know them to be as verie notorious rebelles, as euer were anie in the world, & therefore was her aſsiſtence not giuen becauſe ſhee loued them, but becauſe ſhee hated the King of Spayn, and ſo made vſe of them as the inſtruments of her hate.
            
            
               Tawney-ſcarf.
               Then muſt there bee cauſe why ſhee hated the King of Spayn, and hating him, ſhee had reaſon to favor and foſter thoſe that hated him as wel as her ſelf.
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               I pray Sir, for the inſtruction of my ignorance, tel mee the cauſe why ſhee hated him.
            
            
               Tawney-ſcarf.
               The cauſe I cannot tel you, but cauſe I muſt imagine there was.
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               You can know no iuſt cauſe, nor anie man els, but you ſay you muſt imagine there was a cauſe, but this muſt is not

forcecible, vnleſſe it were a cleere caſe that neuer anie man were cauſeleſly hated, But to tel you the true cauſe why in deed ſhee ha
                     •
                  ed him, it was no other then for dooing her good.
            
            
               Tawney ſcarf.
               That mee thinkes is impoſsible.
            
            
               Red ſcarf.
               Impoſsible onlie to good and gratefull myndes.
               The King of Spayn in her ſiſter Queen Maries tyme, did her no leſſe good then the ſaving of her lyf, and experience hath often ſhewed that there are ſome kynd of people that can neuer abyde thoſe that they are verie deeply beholding vnto, becauſe they think the obligation of gratitude to bee a bondage, whereas want of gratitude when it conſiſteth in the wil and not in the power, is monſtrous and not humayn.
            
            
               Tawney ſcarf.
               That the king of Spayn ſaued her lyf can hardly bee prooueed, for albeit ſhee

was impriſoned in her ſiſters tyme, yet ſhee was neuer broght to anie publyke triall, and ſo there was no ſaving of her lyf needfull, ſhee not beeing by law found giltie.
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               If it had come to that, it had gon hard with her, but the King of Spayn preuented it, and thereby not onlie ſaued her lyf, but alſo her honor.
            
            
               Tawney-ſcarf.
               But how is this prooued?
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               That there were diuers conſpiracies of treaſon in her ſiſters tyme is evident, that ſhee was apprehended and put in priſon vpon them, is evident, that ſhee was the onlie hope & obiect of the conſpira
                     •
                  ors is evident, and that ſome of them accuſed her is alſo evident, for religion her troobles were not, becauſe ſhee made profeſsion of the religion of her ſiſter, and daylie heard Maſſe, Some cauſe there muſt bee of her apprehenſion,

which muſt alſo bee ſome great cauſe, for no ſmall cauſe can vrge the calling in queſtion, and apprehenſion of the ſiſter of a Queen regnant, and her next and apparent heyre, But I wil leaue the belief of this to your own leaſure & pleaſure, when you ſhal haue better thoght vpon it, or better enformed your ſelf about the matter.
            
            
               Tawney-ſcarf.
               I accept of that libertie, but in the meane tyme I muſt tel you that I muſt yet put you to your trumpes, about the greateſt and moſte important cauſe of Queen Elizabethes & our natiōs fauouring & aſsiſting the Hollanders, which was the cauſe of religion, they profeſsing with vs, one ſame Ghoſpel.
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               I doubt whether they profeſſe with vs one ſame Epiſtle, but one ſame Ghoſpel I am ſure they profeſſe not.
            
            
               Tawney-ſcarf.
               I pray what differs their Ghoſpel frō ours?
            
            
               
               Red-ſcarf.
               Is there no difference between Proteſtants and Puritanes?
            
            
               Tawney-ſcarf.
               Not much.
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               Why haue wee then ſo much cōtended about ſo litle a difference? why haue ſo manie bookes bin written by thoſe of the one and the other ſyde, one againſt another? why reſtraints of preaching? why impriſonment of ſomanie of the bretheren? why puniſhments with death and exile?

               I graunt you, ſome ſeditious and vurulie tounged fellowes haue ſmarted.

               Had it bin wel donne to defend ſuch?

               No.

               More then ſuch our countrimē defēd in Holland, for your Gomariſts in Holland

Heer at home you ſeeme not willing to defend ſuch vurulie tounged fellowes, & yet you go from hence into Holland to fight for them, But theſe fellowes are yet more vurulie tounged then our Puritanes, for they go farther then to the making of Pettie Popes, and Pettie Antichriſtes of our Biſhops, Seeing they wil make whoſoeuer it bee beeing a mortal creature, & taking vpon him the name or title of Supreame head, or gouernor of the Churche, to bee no leſſe then an Idol, and thoſe that giue vnto him ſuch title, to bee no leſſe thē

But how had Queen Elizabeth ſeen her ſelf rewarded if theſe, good Ghoſpellers had in her tyme ſo wyde opened their budget as to let her ſee their making making of herſelf an Idol, & her prelates who Puritanes did but make Pettie Popes & pettie Antichriſtes, to bee no better then Idolaters.

You muſt vnderſtand that I am not ignorant, that manie of our nation who deuote themſelues, to the ſeruice of the Hollanders, think their endeuours directly employed for the maintenance of one ſame religion with that of England, wherein I haue heer cleerly prooued them to bee deceaued, But now will I go further, and as cleerly prooue vnto you that you do aſwell defend Lutheraniſme, Anabaptiſme, and Iudaiſme, as the Holland Religion, that you ſuppoſed to haue bin all one with yours.
               You muſt conſider that the Holland rebelles at the beginning of their rebellion to the end they might fortefy themſelues with all ſortes and ſectes, made open profeſsion that according to the Ghoſpel, all men oght to haue their conſciences free, and that no man for his religion oght to bee called in queſtion or troobled, by meanes whereof the religions and beliefs in Holland▪
                  
                  
are grown to bee infinit, euerie mā making choyce to bee of what religion hee liſt, and if hee liſt not chuſe anie of the rel

                  ōs beeing allowed in Englād▪
                   but beeing by authoritie of the States allowed in Holland whoſoever employeth himſelf in defēce of that vſurped State & Gournment doth conſequētly

defend theſe fowre different religious, & aſwel all fowre as anie one. He defendeth that Caluiniſme, that maketh either Prelate or Prince that hath the title of Supreame headſhip or Gouernment of the Churche, to bee an Idol.
               Hee defendeth Lutheraniſme that holdeth the real preſence of Chriſte to bee in the Sacrament, euen the verie ſame bodie that was borne of the bleſſed Virgin Marie, Hee defendeth Anabaptiſme that holdeth it vnlawfull to Baptiſe children, and among other hereſies teacheth that Chriſte took no fleſh of the Virgin Marie. And hee defendeth Iudaiſme that denyeth our Sauiour Chriſte to bee the true Meſsias and Sauiour of the world, for if by force of armes the ſtate of theſe States were not defended, theſe different ſectes could haue in Holland no allowance of free exerciſe of religion. Now beſydes theſe allowed exerciſing ſectes, there is the late riſen ſect of the Pe fectists, which as it ſeemeth needeth

no leaue or allowance of exerciſe, becauſe it is come to ſuch perfection that it is paſt exerciſe. Theſe bee ſuch as haue bin great travailers in the woord, and continual goers to ſermons, and fynding that S. Paule ſpeaketh, of ſome that are alwayes learning, and neuer attayning vnto the knowledge of the truthe, they wil not bee accompted ſuch truants or non proficientes, as ſtil to haue need of teaching and inſtruction, they perceaue by their inward illumination of ſpirit, that they are come to the rypenes of perfection, they haue made trial thereof by their examining one another, aſwell about the expoſition of textes, as of their text-faſtnes in citing chapter and verſe without miſtaking it, as redelie, yea and ſome tymes more redelie then the Preacher himſelf, whereby they ſee themſelues ſomuch to haue profited, that they haue no need to run vp and down after ſermon-makers, but leaue them to the inſtructing & teaching of the ignorant.
               
                  
Theſe now and then meet together among themſelues, and conſolate one another in the Lord, with ſinging of Pſalmes, & diſcourſing out of the woord, according to the perfection & greatnes of their knowledge.
               Where are our poor Puritanes in reſpect of theſe, that all the dayes of their lyues run vnſatisfied with ſermon-hearing, behold how theſe Holland bretherē haue gotten the ſtart of them, and leaue them to remayn the perpetual prentiſes of their ſermon-makers.

               Greater but not better, for I ſuppoſe you vnderſtood it not to bee ſo il, but beeing ſo good as you ſuppoſed it, to wit to bee employed in defence of the Ghoſpel, it could bee but bad, becauſe no good Ghoſpel can allow ſtealing.

               Not with intention to diſgrace your ſelf, but to let you ſee how vniuſt and wrōg a cours both you and others take, to the end that knowing it, you & they may relinquiſh it, and make choyce of a cours more agreable to your woorthineſſes and valour.

               But now Sir I muſt tel you concerning your choyce of ſeruice, that if wee had one of our preachers heer, hee would tel you that it were in deſence of Idolatrie.
            
            
               Red ſcarf.
               If hee did ſo, and could prooue it ſo, I would aske God forgiuenes & leaue it, but that is hee not able to prooue.
            
            
               Tawney-ſcarf.
               Hee would tel you that you woorſhiped bread in the Maſſe, for the bodie of Chriſte.
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               If wee ſo did, that were Idolatrie in deed. Wee do not in anie ſorte intend anie woorſhip vnto bread, all the deuotion woorſhip and honor which there wee doe, is meerly & ſincerly intended vnto the true bodie of Chriſt, the which if it ſhould not bee there, then is there no woorſhip or honor at all by vs intended, But our warrant for the beeing

thereof there, is ſo great that it is not deryued from the mouth of anie mortall man, but euen from the verie mouth of him that is Chriſte and God, who cannot poſsiblie deceaue vs, neither can his power bee inſufficient to make good his own woordes, and if it were poſsible that it could bee but bread, yet hee having ſayd it was his bodie and I belieuing it ſo to bee, his

                  uſtice & goodnes is ſuch that hee cannot condemne mee of misbelief, himſelf having bin the cauſe why I ſo belieue, for if hee neuer had ſayd it, I had neuer belieued it. I can do Chriſte no greater honor then to giue credit vnto his woordes, nor no greater diſhonor then not to belieue them to bee veritable.
            
            
               Tawney-ſcarf.
               But Sir, our Learned men ſay that Chriſtes woordes at his laſt ſupper oght otherwiſe to bee interpreted, & not vnderſtood as hee there ſpake them, but that in ſaying the bread was his bodie,

hee intēded to haue it vnderſtood to bee the ſigne or figure of his bodie.

               They that pretend to prooue all their doctrine by ſcripture, do conſequently oblige themſelues to ſhew vs wherein ſcripture it is ſayd that Chriſte ment it for the ſigne or figure of his bodie?
               If they haue this knowlege by inward illumination, how can they let vs know that it is of God?

               That Chriſte ment it for the figure of his bodie is Caluiniſtical & Anabaptiſtical ſcripture, made without book, but in ſacred ſcripture not to bee foūd, & as for their inward illuminatiōs what cā they bee other thē ſuch dreames as all other ſectaries are as full of as they, & cā ſay aſwel as they, that they had thē frō aboue

& perhapsly not altogether neither, for it may bee that ſuch fancies came in their heades when they were in their garrets. And yet was the inward illumination of Loy the Slater of Antwerp in lyklyhood more higher, for hee (as hee ſayd) had his as he ſat aboue on the top of a hows couering it with ſlate, and it was, that there were no devilles, no hel, nor no reſurrection of the dead, and that Chriſte & his Apoſtles, mētioning ſuch thinges, ment otherwiſe thē they ſpake, and in this his illumination hee was ſo confident, that the light of burning fire, wherein himſelf was coſumed, could not put him out of his opinion.
               And ſeeing you confeſſe not to haue heard anie text alleaged that maketh this Sacrament a figure of Chriſte his bodie, nor anie proof or reaſon to oblige belief of imagined illuminations, I wil now ſhew you by playn ſcripture that Chriſt himſelf could not meane it to bee the figure of his bodie.

               I pray you then Sir tel mee, was it the figure of Chriſte his bodie that was crucifyed for vs on the Croſſe, or was it his true bodie?
            
            
               Tawney-ſcarf.
               It was without all doubt his true bodie.
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               Then muſt without all doubt his true bodie bee in this Sacrament, ſeeing Chriſt ſayd: Take and eat this is my bodie which shalbe giuen for you, &c. and that no figure was giuen for vs.
            
            
               Tawney-ſcarf.
               There by the Lord, you haue poſed mee in deed.

               But I wil yet go further with you, ſure I am that none of the diſciples of Chriſt that were preſent at the ſpeaking of thoſe woordes, do aſsigne vs to the

ſeeking out of ſome other meaning, if this had bin requiſite themſelues had known it beſt, & could beſt haue bin the interpreters, & ſo without all doubt would haue bin, if the intention of Chriſte had bin ſuch, for neuer would they haue letten all enſuying Chriſtians of the world as well of the Greek as of the Latin Churche and all others, haue run on in the belieuing his woordes as they were ſpoken, vntill hee ſhould ſend new teachers into the world to interpreet his meaning fifteen hundreth yeares after they were ſpoken, which cannot ſtand with the prouidence and goodnes of God, But to the contrarie that no ſuch interpretation was by God intended, is cleerly manifeſted to all the world, by the confuſion which hee hath permitted to bee among the interpreters, the one interpreting his woordes one way, the other another way, & ſo contrarie & diſcordāt that no reconciliation can bring them

to haue one ſame vnderſtāding of Chriſt his meaning, And therefore remayn they to their own ſhame and confuſion in perpetuall diſcord, giuing in effect the one the other the ly about the matter, and challenging one another to the weapō of the woord, euen to the killing and ſleaing of ſoules.
               I haue aduentured heer to ſay thuſmuch notwithſtanding I am no diuine, becauſe you ſhould vnderſtād how farre Catholykes are from the moſte abhominable ſin of Idolatrie, And I muſt further note vnto you the abſurditie of this calumnie: Idolatrie did alwayes conſiſt in the offring vp of Sacrifiſe to Idoles, but by the making of Catholikes Idolaters they do make the Sacrifiſe it ſelf, which they offer vp, to bee an Idol.
            
            
               Tawney-ſcarf.
               I perceaue you would ſeeme to haue bin to heard for mee if I ſhould giue you

ouer ſo, But I muſt now demaund further of you, whether Proteſtants or Papiſts go neerer to the manner of Chriſt his celebrating this Sacrament, Chriſte I am ſure both inſtituted and celebrated it at a table, but not at an Altar, as you doe, and therefore you varie and differ from Chriſte, and this beeing ſo manifeſt, it is conſequently manifeſt, that heer I haue put you down, for this you cannot deny.
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               I haue alredie told you that I am no diuine, and I had not thought to haue bin by you put to defend matter of religion, but ſeeing you haue again put mee to it, and that you think you haue put mee down about it. If I cannot recouer my ſelf I ſuppoſe you wil triumphe and trample vpon mee. True it is that Chriſte inſtituted and celebrated this B. Sacrament vpon a table, and not vpon an Altar, and Proteſtants do alſo celebrate their communion vpon a table,

wherein they ſhew themſelues to teach and controlle their Patriarche Luther, who celebrated his communion vpon an Altar, as all his trueſt followes in Germanie continew to do, as alſo their anceters the Huſſytes of Bohemia, and yet did both Huſſe and Luther, aſſure them ſelues to haue penetrated as farre into the woord as Caluinian-Proteſtants, and Anabaptiſts can aſſure themſelues to do, no Chriſtians in the world vſing tables in ſteed of Altars but onelie they, nor none denying the real preſence of Chriſtein that Sacrament but they, and their dependants.
               But now as touching your Proteſtants celebrating vpon a table, to the end you may diſcouer how truely they imitate Chriſte I muſt diſcouer vnto you a notable trick of fraud of theirs (if I may bee ſo bold as call it ſo) which is, that they make a ſhew of exactly imitating Chriſte his manner of dooing, by the vſe of tables & not Altars, to deceaue the ignorāt

multitude, but they deny the veritie of Chriſte his woordes in the principalle matter of faith which vnto this Sacrament is belonging, which is no pettie peece of cooſinage, and moſte farre from the true imitation of Chriſte, ſeeing faith and belief importeth more then a ſhew of obſeruing his manner of dooing in the onely vſe of a table.
               The cauſe and reaſon why Chriſte celebrated on a table, and not vpon an Altar, was becauſe hee had ſupped at the ſame table, & after hee had ſupped he there celebrated this Sacrament, having purpoſely referred it for the laſt and moſte principall actiō which hee would performe in the preſence of his diſciples before his paſsion.
               But if Proteſtants would profeſſe herein to follow Chriſte ptecyſely, thē muſt they not celebrate their communiō vpon howſ-tables, in Churches, ſeeing Chriſte did not ſo, but vpon howſ-tables in priuate howſes, & in paued parlers of

ſuch howſes. It muſt alſo bee at night & after ſupper, at which ſupper they muſt haue eaten a roaſted Lamb.
               There muſt alſo bee neither more nor leſſe then thirteene perſons at the table, and theſe muſt bee all men, for Chriſte had not one woman preſent at his celebration.
               There muſt neither Ghoſpel nor Epiſtle bee red, for when Chriſte celebrated they were not written, Geneua ſonges muſt not thear bee ſung, but the Hymne (if Proteſtant reformation can produce it) muſt bee repeated, which was ſayd before hee and his diſciples roſe from the table.
               But it now appeereth that Proteſtants, make a ſhew of imitating Chriſte onlie in the vſe of a howſ-table, and omitt all the reſt, which is but an imitation by peece meal, taking and leaving, what they liſt, at their own pleaſures And I dare confidently avouch, that if anie Sermon-maker in

                  England ſhould in his pulpit vrge the vſe of all theſe omitted thinges, for the more exact following of Chriſt, wherein muſt alſo bee compryſed his girding himſelf with a towel and his waſhing his communicants feet, hee ſhould bee exactly puniſhed for his labor, and thus may you ſee what is become of your making a howſ-table a Churche-table.
            
            
               Tawney-ſcarf.
               But ſay you what you can, you cannot deny but Chriſte vſed a table and not an Altar, and therefore wee imitate Chriſt more them you.
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               You make a ſhew to imitate Chriſte, and it is but in the onlie vſe of a table, which is as it were but a couer to hyde your deuiall of the veritie of the chiefeſt matter of faith, and why do you not imitate the reſt which heere I haue mētioned as wel as onlie the table, ſeing you ſhould better imitate Chriſte in his whole manner of dooing then in a parte

thereof? or can you ſhew mee where you were appointed to imitate him in the vſe of a howſ-table, and not in the reſt, nor in the Sacrament of Baptiſme as wel as in this one thing of his ſupper, Chriſt was baptiſed in a riuer, why baptiſe you not alſo in riuers, vpon what warrant vſe you Fontes in Churches more then Altars.
               But now muſt I go further with you ſeeing you haue put mee to it, and tel you of another Communion fraud, and I pray you note it. Your Proteſtant miniſter in his adminiſtring his communion vſeth theſe woordes, to his communicant. vidz.

I demaund now of you whether Chriſte be truelie imitated heer in or no. Or whether theſe woordes heer by the

Miniſter ſpoken, are the ſame woords that Chriſt him ſelf did ſpeak?

               Did not Chriſte ſay vnto his Apoſtles, Take & eat this in remenbrance of mee.
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.

               Wil you deny that?
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               I cannot but deny it, becauſe Chriſte did not ſo ſpeak.
            
            
               Tawney-ſcarf.
               How ſpake hee then?
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               Hee ſayd vnto his Diſciples when hee had taken bread & bleſſed it Take and eat this is my bodie, &c. and having ſayd this, thē ſayd hee further, Do this in cōmemoratiō of mee. The Apoſtles were willed heer to do two thinges, the one was, To eat the Bodie of Chriſte, the other was to do this in commemoration of him, by the firſt precept they did eat the Bodie of Chriſte, by the ſecond, in Chriſt his

ſaying Do this, they had power and authoritie giuen them to do afterward as Chriſt there thē did, that is, to take bread to bleſſe it, to pronounce his ſacred woords ouer it, thereby to make it become his bodie, and to adminiſter it vnto others as hee had adminiſtred it vnto them, and to do or ſacrifiſe this, in commemoration of him, for if this later precept had not bin giuen the celebratiō of this Sacrament had not bin cōtinued by the Apoſtles & their ſucceſſors, but had onlie bin there at that tyme performed by Chriſt & ſo haue ceaſſed. Thus may you ſee what a notable trick of Caluiniſtical falſitie it is, to abuſe the people by confounding the woordes of Chriſte in ſaying in ſteed of his woorde Take and eat this is my bodie, And Do this in commemoration of mee, to ſay, Take and eat this in remembrance of mee, which Chriſt ſayd not, but they as if hee had ſo ſayd, do thereby conſequently inferre that hee did ſay and vnſay, or as if his ſaying,

                  Do this in remembrance of mee, which they falſify, and make to bee Eat this in remembrance of mee, did wholie dyſanul and take away the whole effect of his former woordes which were, Take and eat this it my bodie, &c. which is to make Chriſte to haue ſpoken thoſe woords friuolouſly and to no purpoſe, for if Chriſt intended not this his bleſſed & conſecrated bread to bee his bodie to what end ſpake hee thoſe woordes? what edification could they yeeld? why might they not aſwel or better haue bin left vnſpoken? And why might hee not more directly and cleerly haue ſayd at the firſt. Take and eat this bread in remembrance of mee, or as a ſigne or figure of my bodie, this had bin better fitting for the forming of a Proteſtant communion, if hee had intended it, But Proteſtants to come now ſo long after, to make Chriſte a ſayer and an vnſayer, to bee hild vnpowrable to performe ſo much as he ſayd, or to haue ſpoken friuolouſly and to no purpoſe,

can no way ſtand with Chriſtian pietie, nor confident faith in Chriſte.

               By the Lord you put mee to it ſtil, but I muſt for all that haue about with you concerning another matter. You vſe to woorſhip Images and by woorſhiping them you make Idolles of them.
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               By this reaſon they that do reuerence vnto the Kinges chaire of State, do there of make an Idol allo. But you muſt vnderſtand that as the ſound of woordes entring at the eare do reuyne memorie in the mynde, of the thing which by the ſound is intended, ſo is memorie no leſſe reuyued by the ſight of the eye, and as at the hearing of the name of Ieſus, the mynd is ſtirred vp to a deuout remembrance and reuerence of him, ſo is the mynd by the ſight of his Image, ſtirred vp in lyke manner. And heer by the way, becauſe it is not impertinent to the purpoſe, I muſt alleage vnto you a late

example ſomwhat concerning this purpoſe, An Engliſh ſervingman coming ouer out of Englād to Antwerp & beholding in the principall ſtreet of the cittie the Image of Chriſte on the Croſſe, ſtood on the ſuddayn, amaſed as it were, at the ſight thereof, & ſuppoſing it (as it ſhould ſeeme) to haue bin the dead bodie of ſome malefactor newly executed (it beeing painted ouer with a pale dead colour) demaunded of one that was with him, what that man had donne that was ſo nayled vp there, but when the other told him it was the Image of Chriſte, repreſenting vnto the view of Chriſtians his crucifying and death on the Croſſe, for the redemption of the world, hee confeſſed that hee had heard it preached that Chriſt was crucifyed, but hee knew not for all that what crucifying ment, nor did hee euer apprehend it as now at the ſight of the Image hee was moued to doe. I make no doubt but this man had heard ſermons in England more thē
                  
enoughe & yet was hee with all his Sermon-hearing ſuch a Chriſtian, as neither knew nor apprehended how Chriſte had dyed for his ſaluation. You may heerby iudge of the vtillitie of the Schoole wherein hee had had his education, and of the requiſytnes of ſuch repreſentations to the view of Chriſtian people, and therefore with no litle reaſon did that great and godly Doctor S. Auguſtine (as did alſo other anciēt & holie Doctors terme the Images of Chriſte & his ſaintes, the books of lay people where by you may ſee that theſe men were no good proteſtāts, for had they ſo bin, they would haue defaced & broken them, & ſlaundered thē with the fals imputatiō of beeing Idolles. Beeing then as heere hath bin ſhewed, ordayned for repreſē
                  tations & memories of Chriſte and his ſaints no reuerence is dōne at the ſight of them, as meerly intēded to the Images thēſelues, but euer intending Chriſt or his ſaints or friends which ſuch

Images may repreſent, for when the woman troobled with the flux had a deſyre to touch the Hemme of Chriſte his garment it was not becauſe ſhee thoght the garment of it ſelf could do her good, but becauſe ſhee thoght that vertue by that meanes might come from Chriſt vnto her, and yet may this deed of this woman ſeem according to the doctrine of Proteſtants to bee an act of Idolatrie, no leſſe then the woorſhip of an Image, which Chriſt (not beeing proteſtantly conceyted) approoued farre otherwiſe, both by curing her, and comending the greatnes of her faith. You muſt alſo vnderſtand that Sacrifice was by Pagans offred vnto Idolles, incenſe was burut vpon their Alters, and it was death by pagan lawes to refuſe to do it, But ſomuch as the dooing of reuerence vnto an Image among Chriſtians, is not comaunded, nor is it taken for ſcandall to pas by an Image & not to do reuerence vnto it, but left to euerie mannes

own diſcretion according as his mynd is ſtirred vp to ſome deuout cogitation, which by the ſight of the Image hee may bee moued vnto.
            
            
               Tawney-ſcarf.
               I muſt confeſſe your woordes carrie ſence in them, and that I neuer heard thoſe reaſons before, But there reſteth yet one thing, that I muſt haue about with you for, wherein I think you wil bee put to your trumpes to the full.
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               If I then fynd not trumps enough wherewith to defend my ſelf, my defect of trumpes, will become your triumphe.

               Then Sir, I muſt demaund of you, with what proof of Scripture or ſhew of reaſon men may bee perſwaded to belieue that ſuch as are mortal men and ſinners themſelues, can forgiue the ſinnes of other men. And ſtrāge it is that ſo manie can bee made ſuch fooles as on their

knees vnto a prieſt to vtter the verie ſecrets of their ſoules and conſciences, yea and perhaps ſomtymes to declare ſuch ſinnes vnto him, as themſelues after they haue donne them, are aſhamed to thinck on.
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               I remember to haue red, that the Iewes vpō Chriſte his forgiuing of one his ſinnes, ſayd, that none could forgiue ſinnes but God onlie. True in deed it is, that no mortall man of his own authoritie, can pardon ſinnes, yet having commiſſion from God to do it, why may hee not then doe it? vnles you wil ſay it is not in the power of God to giue him power to do it, and that you will limit God to vſe no miniſters vnder him for the executing of his will, but wil haue him doe all himſelf. But that it hath pleaſed our Saviour Chriſte to giue ſuch, power and authoritie to men, is manifeſt by his breathing vpon his Apoſtles, and ſaying, Receaue the holie Ghoſte, whoſe
                  
                  ſinnes you shall forgiue, they are forgiuen, and whoſe ſinnes you shal retayn, they are retayned I pray tel mee now whether you think the Apoſtles by this authoritie giuen them by Chriſte, had power to forgiue ſinnes or not?

               Mee thinkes I muſt confeſſe they had.

               Having authoritie then to forgiue ſinnes, do you think they did vſe it?
            
            
               Tawney-ſcarf.
               It may bee they did.
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               Wee muſt make it a cleer caſe that they ſo did, for if they did not, then did Chriſte giue thē a frivolous commiſsiō, or themſelues committed a great fault in neglecting to execute his will, b
                     •
                  t it were impietie to think that either Chriſte would giue a friuolous commiſsion, or that his Diſciples would neglect the execution thereof.
            
            
               
               Tawney-ſcarf.
               Admit that Chriſte gaue them ſuch authoritie, and that they executed it, is it therefore ſayd, that Prieſts ſhould haue it now?
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               If ſuch power and grace had onlie bin giuen by Chriſte to his Apoſtles, and was not to remayn from them vnto their ſucceſſors, then could no bodie haue reaped benefit thereby, but ſuch as lyued in the tyme of the Apoſtles, and were conuerſant with them, and ſo ſhould all other enſuing Chriſtians haue remayned depryued, of this grace and benefit, but ſo to think were alſo impietie.
               When Chriſte gaue his Apoſtles commiſsion to go ouer all the world to preach and Baptiſe, I ſuppoſe you wil not ſay that hee intended not that their ſucceſſors ſhould alſo preache and baptiſe. If hee intended they ſhould, as I make no doubt, you will confeſſe, why

ſhould hee not alſo intend the authoritie of forgiuenes of ſinnes vnto the ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles, to the end that after-coming Chriſtians might aſwell enioy that grace and benefit, as thoſe that lyued in the tyme of the Apoſtles, or ſhew where the one was called in or prohibited, and the other not.

               But this confeſsing of ones ſinnes to a Prieſt is ſuch a thing, that I much wonder how people could bee broght vnto it.
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               If you wel conſider thereof, you ſhall ſee it a woork not to bee wroght by man, but by the wonderfull cōcurring

power of God, for how were it els poſſible, that Apoſtles of the Catholyke Churche ſhould bee able to convert ſomanie Pagan Princes & people to Chriſtianitie, and cōſequently to bring them to that deuotion and humillitie as to kneel down and make confeſsion of their ſinnes to a Prieſt, whereas wee cannot ſee that miniſters do conuert anie ſuch people vnto anie their new religions, albeit it bee farre more eaſie, and would neuer trouble them with confeſsion of ſinnes.
               This practiſe of confeſsion of ſinnes albeit to the eares of new teachers it ſeemeth harſh, yet was it put in practiſe, by the holie friend of Chriſt, S. Iohn Baptiſt, before Chriſt gaue the authoritie of pardoning ſinnes vnto his Apoſtles, for the penitent people that reſorted vnto S. Iohn Baptist, did make confeſsion of their ſinnes, which it is not lyke they would haue donne, nor that the ſcripture would haue mentioned it as a

deed wel donne, if S. Iohn himſelf had not perſwaded them vnto it, or approoued it. The Scripture ſayeth they came vnto him confeſsing their ſinnes. It is one thing for a man to confeſſe himſelf to bee a ſinner, and another thing to confeſſe his ſinnes, for when hee confeſſeth his ſinnes, hee confeſſeth what ſinnes hee hath committed. And the Apoſtle S. Iames promulgateth the precept, by ſaying, Confeſſe your ſinnes one to another, for this Apoſtle knowing that Chriſte h
                     ••
                   ſayd to him, and the reſt of the Apoſtles, VVhoſe ſinnes you forgiue they are forgiven▪
                   & caet. Did alſo know that confeſsion of ſinnes muſt go before pardō of ſinnes.
               But if wee conſider it wel wee ſhal ſee it to bee a moſte great grace and happines imparted by Chriſte vnto men in leauing behynd him with his ſervants and Prieſts, this commiſsion and priuilege, whereby ſinners by

contrition confeſsion, and ſatisfaction of and for their ſinnes may put themſelues in ſtate of grace, and diſchardge themſelues of ſo heauie a waight in this world, as would beare down their ſoules to hel in the next.

               The caſe concerning this matter of confeſsion beeing ſo cleer, as heer both by ſcripture and neceſſarie deduced reaſons you haue ſhewed, I wonder verie much why our Learned men, that pretend all their recours to Scripture, ſhould not ſee and practiſe the ſame.
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               They cannot but ſee it, but they ſcufle it ouer, the ſilenceing thereof beeing vnto them, reaſon of ſtate.
            
            
               Tawney-ſcarf.
               How ſhal I vnderſtand that?
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               You ſhal vnderſtand that the new religion-makers of this tyme, to draw people from the old, found it fit for thē
                  
in policie, to make their new religions more eaſie and pleaſing, and therefore, ſuch as follow the doctrine of Caluin taking a way confeſsion, broght in predeſtination, teaching that God hath determined who hee will haue ſaued, and who hee wil haue damned, before euer themſelues are borne: and who hee wil graunt or deny his grace vnto, and that to ſuch as hee wil haue to bee damned albeit they bee innocent children ſucking at their mothers breſts, and of themſelues could neuer deſerue it, yet will hee reſoluedly deny them his grace ſo as they ſhall and muſt bee damned, By which new and moſte damnable doctrine, confeſsion of ſinnes to ſuch as are of yeares & able to make it, is as vtterly needles, taken away, and ſo is alſo in verie trothe, all deuotion and dooing of good deedes, for ſeeing God hath determined before how hee will diſpoſe of all mennes ſoules, his diſpoſition muſt hold whether they thēſelues do wel or il.

and to what purpoſe then were going to confeſsion?
            
            
               Tawney-ſcarf.
               In deed I haue heard enoughe of this in Holland, where Doctor Arminius a Proteſtant himſelf, did fynd it to bee againſt the iuſtice, and goodnes of God, and manie are now grown to think it ſo alſo, and to bee of his opinion.
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               There reſteth yet one point that I muſt note vnto you concerning this matter of confeſsion, becauſe you ſayd you marveled that men could bee made ſuch fooles, as to tell their ſinnes vnto Prieſts, but this wonder wilbe no wonder whē you conſider that Prieſts muſt no leſſe make confeſsion of their ſinnes then other men, for you muſt not vnderſtand that confeſsion of ſinnes vnto a Prieſt, is an inuention broght vp by Prieſts, to bee practiſed vpon other men, which they perſwade vnto it, but a thing ordayned and inſtituted by

Chriſte and his Apoſtles, & of religious dutie and obligation practiſed and continued in Chriſte, his Catholyke Churche where there is not anie prieſt that is not as much obliged to make Confeſsion of his ſinnes vnto an other Prieſt, as anie other man is, and where there is no, Eccleſiaſticall perſon, Prelate, Biſhop, or the Pope himſelf, that heerin is exempted, for euen the Pope who is the chief and head of all the Catholyke Clergie, muſt fit on his knees and make his confeſsion to a Prieſt, albeit his own inferior, ſo as you may ſee that Prieſts in this matter of confeſsion haue not impoſed a burthen vpon other men which themſelues do not beare. The lyke humilitie in confeſſion of ſinnes is alſo ſeen in Emperors Kinges & Princes, no leſſe then in other people.
            
            
               Tawney-ſcarf.
               But is this, ſo in deed.
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               It is moſte vndoubtedly true.
            
            
               
               Tawney-ſcarf.
               But what if a Prieſt ſhould diſcloſe▪ what is vttred vnto him inconfeſsion?
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               If hee ſhould ſo do hee ſhould bee grivouſly puniſhed, and ſuſpended from the practiſe of his prieſtly function during his whole lyf, for confeſsions muſt not in anie caſe bee reuealed, and if ſo bee this ſeal of ſecreſie, where with the lippes of the prieſt are ſealed vp, ſhould come to bee violated, it were the deſtruction of the Sacrament of Pennance, which the holie Ghoſte will neuer permit.
               The Prieſt wel knoweth that confeſſion is made vnto God more thē to him, and that hee as the miniſter of God, is by hearing of the ſinne to iudge thereof, and accordingly to giue the ſinner good and ghoſtly counſel, and to ordayn him his Pennance.
               To conclude this matter I muſt tel you, that it is onlie the diuel, who to

keep vs from beeing abſolued of our ſinnes, putteth all feare and ſhame before our eyes, when wee ſhould go to cōfeſſe them, but ſequeſtreth it from our ſight when wee go about to comit them.
            
            
               Tawney-ſcarf.
               You haue of this matter ſayd ſo-much that you haue made mee ſee that I ſtil haue the woorſt end of the ſtaf, and therefore to diſpaire of the victorie, and to ſee my reaſons not ſufficient enough (in regard of yours) to make you turn Proteſtant.
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               If you could bring mee ſo farre as ſo much to diſlyke my religion as to bee willing to relinquiſh it, it doth not cōſequently follow that I ſhould turn proteſtant, but I ſhould then ſtand in a great labrinth to conſider which of all the new religions that this day by pretence of Scripture wil needes bee the true religion, I might make choyce of, for the vndoubted true religiō in deed, you muſt

vnderſtād I haue bin a travayler & haue had more triall and experience of theſe pretenders in the world abroad, then our puritane Idiots, that onlie heare and heed what their home-bred miniſter telles them, when he wil make it ſeeme as thogh the Catholyke religion had no more contradictors but thoſe that are of his religion, as if there were not diuers others of different religions from that which hee holdeth (and of much lyke new-nes) that do as earneſtly contradict the Catholyke religiō & aſmuch pretēd to haue their onlie recours to ſcripture, as poſsibly hee can doe, & wil not by Scripture bee put down by ſuch as hee is, albeitthey ſhould with Bibles beat out their braines.
               All theſe, how different ſoeuer from ours, & from one another, do as earneſtly pretend reſtauration of the ancient religion of the Apoſtles tyme, as they for their lyues can do, In which pretence both of theires and of ours, I haue ſo

throughly penetrated, that I haue fully diſcerned the Idlenes thereof, for no one of them all can carrie the matter away with anie proofs or reaſons peculiar to it ſelf, which none of the reſt cannot make his vſe of aſwell as it.
               That there were in the primityue Churche ſomanie different religions as now pretend to reſtore the ſame, who can belieue? That anie one is the reſtorer thereof, how ſhal it bee known which it is? ſeeing none can anie way make himſelf appere to be the ſame before others, If hee wil ſay that hee wil prooue it by the woord of God, how can hee make his proof appeer to others, to bee more cleere then their lyk proofs to him?
               When I conſider how our Puritanes do heer in England ween themſelues to bee the onlie Scripture fellowes of the world, I cannot but laugh with my ſelf to imagine how they would bee taken down with other ſcripture laddes that I

haue met withal in my travailes in Germanie among Arrians, Trinitiſts, Lutherans, Morauian-Anabaptiſts, Holland-Anabaptiſts, and others of pettier ſectes, that at the woord, would make but poor ſnakes of thē. I heard a Lutherā preacher at Augusta tel his auditorie that to deal with a Caluiniſt (intēding our Proteſtāts or Puritanes) the beſt way was to take Gods woord and greaſe him wel with that about the ſnowt, telling him ſtill that Chriſte at his laſt ſupper, ſayd, Take and eat this is my bodie, &c. Not ſuffring him by anie of his Caluiniſtical ſhifts, to ſlip from theſe wordes, ſo may wee conclude quoth hee, that either the Caluiniſt muſt make Chriſte a lyer, or bee a lyer himſelf.
               At Francford I heard an Anabaptiſt demaund of a Caluiniſt, what Scripture hee had for the Chriſtening of children, the Caluiniſt would haue gon about to deduce it by conſequence, away with your conſequenting quoth the Anabaptiſt,

for if conſequences may bee admitted, I wil heare the Papiſts ſpeak before you, you are the verie cooſeners of the world, you brag and boaſt of profeſsion of Scripture, and when you are put to it then forſooth you are farre enough to ſeek, and not in this matter onlie of Chriſtning of Children, but of more matters beſydes, If I would put you to it, and did not ſpare you for pittie, becauſe you are turnd without book alredie.
               I could alleage vnto you ſundrie examples of the reſolutenes of Huſſytes, Lutherans, Anabaptiſts▪ and others in their ſeuerall religions, which is ſuch that none of our ſermon-makers heer in England can anie whit go beyond them, I haue heard ſomanie of their different pulpit cryes, of the light of the Ghoſpel, of the pure woord of God, of inward illumination of ſpirit, of ſealing it with their blood and ſuch lyke pretenſiōs, general to all, & as dulie claymed

by the one ſorte as by the other, that good experience hath taught mee to know ſuch pretenſions heer at home to bee as idle fopperies as I haue found thē in other countries abroade, ſerving onlie to lead away fooles, that ſee no further then the length of their noſes.
               If ſuch as heer do keep the greateſt coyl in their pulpit-crying of their light of the Ghoſpel, and pure woord of God (as thogh without all contradiction they were the onlie men lyving vnder the cope of heauen that had it) would but dare to appeer among theſe other ſeuerall ſortes of profeſſors of other lightes of the Ghoſpel, and other puritie of the woord, and bee vrged if they will bee belieued before all the world beſydes, to ſet down to the manifeſt view of all men, ſuch proofs and reaſons, for their aſſurednes of having the truthe, as all the reſt ſhall not bee able in the verie lyke manner to produce for theirs.
               Good Lord how would then our Engliſh

pulpit boaſters bee puzled, and what pouertie would then their glorious Ghoſpel bee broght vnto? truſt mee there could nothing in this caſe bee better fitting for them thē to tranſport themſelues back agayn into inviſibillitie (if they haue reſerued the f
                     •
                  il) for thereby might they ſaue themſelues from becoming (by beeing pointed at) the obiects of the ſporte of all the others.
               And thuſmuch (with deſyre of pardon) dare I further anouche, that I do not know, anie forreyn countrie vpon earth, wherein in anie ſorte the name of Chriſtianitie is profeſſed, where the religion of England in the iudgment of the Learned of anie of theſe whatſoeuer, is fullie and wholie allowed for good, & not in one principall point or other, gainſayed & contradicted.
               And whereas manie heer in England do ſtand verie much vpon the reſolutenes of their Foxian, Martirs, as thogh

their ſufferance for their Caluiniſtical cauſe were a marvelous, great argument of the goodnes thereof, but which of the other new pretenders cannot produce their Martirs alſo? Huſytes and Lutherans are not without ſtore of them, and both thinking themſelues to bee much wronged by M. Fox. The Huſſites in beeing robbed by him of their Patriarche Iohn Huſse, and the Lutherans by beeing robbed by him in lyke ſorte, of theire much eſteemed martir, fryer Barnes.
               
               As for the Anabaptiſts their number farre exceedeth thoſe of M. Fox, and perhaps ten for one. They that liſt to make the calculation may cōpare thoſe which they haue ſet down in their book of Martirs, entituled, The Sacrifice of the Lord, with the number of thoſe that are in M. Fox his Acts and monuments.
               
               I wil now ceaſſe to bee further tedious vnto you, but by this which I haue related concerning religion, as alſo concerning

your reſolution in your intended ſeruice, I leaue you to iudge which of both our courſes is beſt founded.

               If you wil ſtand ſure from falling, leane vnto the better and the ſtronger ſyde.
            
            
               Tawney-ſcarf.
               I wil think on the matter.
            
            
               Red-ſcarf.
               Forget not then to conſider I pray you, euen for your own honor and the honor of our nation, that Engliſhmen ſtil continewing to ſerue the Hollanders, notwithſtanding all the vilanous wronges they haue dōne them, do preiudice their own eſteem, among other nations, who may imagin them to bee ſo baſely blynded or bewitched by miſtaken Holland

Ghoſpel, that they cannot ſee themſelues made by the Hollanders in a manner as their ſlaues, for ſlaues receaue blowes and ſerue them that beat them, and euen ſo do our countrimen receaue blowes at the handes of the Hollanders, and yet ſerue them. The difference is, that ſlaues are beaten by their Maſters at home, & Engliſhmen by Hollanders abroad, whyle their inconſiderate countrimen ſerue them at home, where if they ſerued them right, they might right ſome of the wronges which abroad they do them. And I cannot enough wonder at the ſenceleſſnes of ſuch giddie pated prentiſes of London as durſt ſo barbarouſly abuſe, an Ambaſſador of a King of Spayn, themſelues not knowing anie cauſe why, & yet when by letters from the Eaſt Indies it was by our own Marchāts ſignifyed how moſte barbarouſly and vilanouſly, the Hollanders had abuſed them, theſe conſiderate youthes were not a whit moued to anger againſt

                  M. Caroon, who carryeth the name of Ambaſſador for the Holland States, but could ſhew themſelues ſo ſoft mynded, as to let him pas quietly in the ſtreets of London in his Coatche, and do him reuerence, as if they had thanked him for it. But beginning now to feare that I may haue bin to tedious vnto you and to this good compagnie, I will with deſyre to be pardoned for my freeneſſe of ſpeech, thank you all for your patience, & heer make an end of this buſynes.
