                     And rayle vpon an other with the iuce on't:
                     I haue writ this booke out of the ſtrength and marrow
                     Of ſix and thirty diſhes at a meale:
                     But moſt on't out of culliſhe of Cocke ſparrowes,

                     Of all things I commend the White-houſe beſt,
                     For plenty and variety of victualls:
                     When I was one of the blacke-houſe profeſt,
                     My fleſh fell halfe a Cubit, time to revolt,
                     When my owne ribs reuolted; but to ſay truth,
                     I haue no preferment yet, that's ſuteable
                     To the greatneſſe of my perſon and my parts:
                     I grant I liue at eaſe, for I am made
                     The Maiſter of the beds, the long acre of beds:
                     But there's no Marie-gold, that ſhuts and opens,
                     
                        Flower gentlee Venis borth, apples of loue,
                     Pinckes, Hyanths, Honie-ſuckles, Daffa-down-dillies,
                     There was a time I'd much more brab then beds,
                     Now I'ue more beds, then drabs:

                     The chiefe of his ill ayme to be at mine honour,
                     Till heauen was pleaſed by ſome vnlookt for accident,

                     We place a charitable ſorrow there;
                     But cuſtome and their leaprous inclination,
                     Quits vs of wonder: for our expectation
                     Is anſwered in their liues, but to finde ſinne
                     Vnder a robe of Sanctity, is able
                     To draw all number to that monſter onely,
                     
                        And leaue created monſters vnadmired,

                     It grieues me that my knowledg muſt be tainted,
                     With his infeſted name,
                     Oh rather with thy finger poynt him out.
