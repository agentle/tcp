But prayer was made without ceasing of the congregacion to God for him. Here Peter was apprehended / caste into pryson / bounde with chaynes / warders appointed to kepe him / & all thinges so handled / that he should by no meanes escape / but all tymes be redy at the firste call to be broughte forth vnto death. Peter loked continually for present deathe. Herode and the Iewes perswaded them selfs to be sure of Peter to kyll him at their pleasur / as though thei had slaine him all redy.

Esau came gentilly vnto hym / louingelye embrased hym / kyssed hym frendly / and for very ioye wepte: so myghty is God to mollefye tyrauntes hartes / whan it pleaseth hym / and to make them gracious and fauorable too hys seruauntes. Howe ofte rede we in the historye of the Gospell / that the Iewes wente aboute too kyll Christe / and yet layde they no hande on hym. The Euangeliste sheweth the cause / sayenge: For Ioan. 7. hys houre was not yet come. But whan the tyme came that God hadde appoynted from euerlastynge / than preuayled the wycked agaynste the manhoode of Christe / layde hande on hym / bounde hym / and fynally putte hym too death / as Christ sayde vnto them: Ye become out as vnto a thefe Luce. 22. wyth sweardes and staues.

If the deuell / the Lyons / the sea / the fyre / the wyndes / the serpentes / &c. can do no harme to the faythfull without bothe the sufferaunce and determination of God / let vs not feare the worldlye tyraūtes / although neuer so mighty / fearce and cruel / whyche are nothyng els but vyle fleshe / earth / asthes / duste and dong / whose tyranny is lyke too a staffe of rede / whose imaginacions / counsayles and deuyses are vayne / folyshe and of none effect / whan the

Lorde God take the parte agaynste them / & whose glorie was the floure of the felde. For they shall do no more against the ellecte and chosen people of God / than God both suffereth and appoynteth. Whan Pylate sitting in iudgement / sayde to our sauiour Christ / knoweth thou not / that I haue power Ioan. 19 to crucifye the / and haue power to deliuer the? Christ aunswered / thou couldest haue no power at all agaynst me / excepte it were geuen the from aboue. Euen so maye we saye of the worldly tyrauntes: Thei shal haue no power at all against vs / except it be geuen them from aboue. And the holy apostles in their prayer vnto God / sayde / that whatsoeuer Herode and Pontius Pilate / with the Gentiles and people of Israel did Act. 4. against Christe / they did nothinge / but that the hande and the counsayl of God had determined before to be done. No more shall the tyrauntes of this worlde do any thynge agaynste vs / but that / whiche God before hath determined to be done frō euerlasting. Of this historie of Peter therfore may we learn two notable thinges. Fyrst that God than moste chiefly helpeth / whan thinges be brought to greatest extremities. Secōdly that the tyrauntes of this worlde can not take away a Christen mans lyfe / nor yet do any more agaynste hym / than the good wil / 

pleasure / determinaciō & appointement off God is / in whose hande alone / as the wyse Eccle. 11 man sayeth / is bothe prosperite & aduersite / lyfe & death.

            ¶ Psalm. 103.
            
               BE thanckefull o my soule vnto the LORDE
               And all that within me haue theyr beynge / 
               Laude / prayse & magnifye with one accorde
               Hys holy & blessed name aboue all thynge.
            
            
               O my soule / once agayn to the I saye
               Be thankeful vnto the Lord euer more / 
               And looke thou forget not night nor daye
               All hys benefites that thou haste in store.
            
            
               For he it is / yea / he it is alone
               Which pardoneth al thy synnes / both more and les / 
               He deliuereth the from all griefe & mone
               And sendeth the health in tyme of sykenes.
            
            
               He saueth thy lyfe from destruccion
               Which otherwyse should perish withoute doubte / 
               
                  
He of mere, 'grace' and tender compassion
               Crouneth the with louing kyndnes round aboute.
            
            
               He with good thinges / thy mouth doth satisfye
               To eate & drinke gyuing the abundance / 
               He maketh the ioyful / yonge and lustye
               Euen as an Egle that is ful of pleasaunce.
            
            
               The LORD dothe minister iustice and iudgement
               To suche as are oppreste with violence / 
               He defendeth the good and innocent
               But the wicked he casteth frō his presence.
            
            
               He shewed hys wayes vnto faythfull Moses.
               And his workes to the sonnes of Israel / 
               That all hys people myghte knowe bothe more and les
               In all kynde of vertue for to excel.
            
            
               O the Lord God euē of his own nature
               Is bent vnto gentilnes and mercye / 
               Yea / frendly is he aboue all measure
               Longe suffering & eke of great petye.
            
            
               For though oure synnes be bothe greate and many
               Yet wil not the Lord be alway chyding / 
               Neither will he for euer be angry
               But shew him self toe vs bothe gentle and louyng.
            
            
               After our synnes he dealeth not with vs
               
                  
Neither according to our wickednes / 
               But lyke a father / bothe gentle & gracious
               He forgeueth al our sinnes / both more & les.
            
            
               For loke how hye is the heauen supernal
               In comparison of the earth full lowe / 
               So great is hys mercy toward them all
               That feare hī & wickednes away throwe.
            
            
               And loke howe wyde the Easte is frome the West
               So farre hath he set all our synnes frō vs / 
               Because oure conscience should be at rest
               And nomore trobled with workes odious.
            
            
               Yea / lyke as a father gentle and tender
               Pittieth hys owne chyldren natural / 
               Euen so is the Lorde merciful euer
               Unto thē that feare him both great & smal.
            
            
               For he beyng our maker knoweth cer

               A man in his lyfe is like vnto grasse
               Hys dayes are few / & but a whyle endure /

               Dothe continew for euer and euer / 
               
                  
Upon thē that feare him with one accorde
               And hys iustice vpō their chylders chylder.
            
            
               I meane vpon such as kepe his coucnaūt
               And do them selfs diligently applye / 
               To kepe hys preceptes / & likewise do graūte
               To frame their whole lyfe accordingly.
            
            
               In heauē hath the Lorde a seat prepared
               For him self / both glorious and royall / 
               And his prince like power is so outstretched
               That it raygneth & ruleth ouer all.

               O prayse the Lorde our God omnipotēt
               All ye hys hostes and armies supernall / 
               Ye seruauntes of hys / whiche alwayes are bent
               To do hys wil / o prayse the Lord aboue all.

               O Blessed is the man at eche season
               That feareth the LORDE God omnipotent / 
               For suche one hath all his delectation
               To accomplysh the Lordes commaūdemēt.
            
            
               Hys sede vpon the earth shall be mighty

               So that his wordes vnto vertue do lede.
            
            
               From hys place shal he neuer be moued
               But alway abyde both constante & sure / 
               The remēbraunce of the iuste & true harted
               Shall for euer and euer styll endure.

               And geueth to the pore their nede to sustain
               Remembred therfore continually
               Shal he be / & his prayse euer remayn.
