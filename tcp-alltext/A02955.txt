               HENRY by the grace of God king
of Fraunce, and Poland, to all
men preſent and to come, greeting.
Whereas there is no commaundement
of God Religion,
or humaine law that can excuſe
the ſubiect, for taking armes
without the decree or permiſsion
of his ſoueraigne to whom it
hath pleaſed his Deuine goodneſſe, to giue all authoritie
ouer him, & to whom onely he hath reſerued the ſword
of power, to vſe for the preſeruation of the good and
the puniſhment and correction of the bad, what may be
thought of that ſubiect, that taketh armes againſt his
owne moſt Chriſtian, lawfull and naturall king? For in
caſe this crime be abhominable in the ſight both of God
and man, and ought to redound to the ſhame and confuſion
of ſuch as commit the ſame, then is there among
all Chriſtians no name odious enough for the Frenchmen,
if through diſloyaltie, riots, and fellonie they continue
not the children of their fathers, thoſe auncient
Frenchmen, who ſo vertuouſly with the perill of their

owne liues haue obteyned and bene noted among all nations
in the world to be the faithfulleſt and moſt loyall to
their kinges.
            Againe if to this ſo horrible a crime there may be added
any encreaſe in reſpect of ſuch bondes, benefites, and
particular gratifications receaued by the ſubiect that armeth
himſelfe againſt his benefactor and lawfull and naturall
king, then are the Duke of Mayenne and the Duke
and Knight of Aumalle worthy that name, which as yet
is not in vſe. And as their rebellion exceedeth all meaſure
and example, ſo ought they likewiſe to be termed the
moſt vnfaithfull and diſloyall in this world, alſo to leaue
to their poſteritie this note of their ingratitude and rebellion,
as a beautifying of the loyaltie of ſuch as remayne
ſtedfaſt in their fidelitie, and iuſt and lawfull obedience;
which God commaundeth them to beare and
yeld to their king.
            All this notwithſtanding, ſo farre did our clemencie
and good will extend, that endeuoring to forget all former
matters and iuſt occaſions, that they had miniſtred
vnto vs, to entreate and chaſtiſe them according to the
deſertes of their diſloyaltie, euen of our ſelues ſeeking
their ſafetie, with the care of their woundes through our
owne, yea and the preſeruation of their liues and honor,
with the expenſe of our owne authoritie. We haue
of late dayes ſent vnto them ſundry and many tymes, diuers
of our good & faithful ſeruants & ſubiects, vvith our
expreſſe letters, as alſo ſince our Herehaughts of armes to
giue the to weet of our good & holy entent, withall that
we were ſtil ready not only to forget all matters paſt, but
alſo to receaue thē into our gracious fauor & cheriſh &
embrace thē as our good & loyall ſubiects, ſo lōg as they
ſhould performe their duties & ſuch their ſubmiſſiōs as
iuſtly they owe vnto vs. Neuertheles euē as an ambitious
& treacherous ſoule is vtterly vncompatible of his Gods

aſſiſtance, & through infidelitie is no longer capable of
ſuch reaſon as might cōteine or reduce him to his duety:
As alſo the Spyder, which is noriſhed with the ſame licour
where out the Bee gathereth both hony and waxe,
doth neuertheleſſe conuert the ſame into poiſon, ſo our
goodnes & clemency infuſed into the harts of ſuch perſons,
abandoned both of God and his holy ſpirit, are conuerted
into corruption, but not into that ſubſtāce which
they ought therof to take, for in liew of humbling themſelues
as they ought, & not cōfeſsing their faults, they are
growen more proud, & haue plunged themſelues in the
deſtruction of both ſoules, liues, honors and credits, together
with whatſoeuer their domeſticall goods, by ſeaſing
vpon our townes and caſtels, and through their trachery
and rebellion, enterpriſing againſt our authoritie, our
Magiſtrates, our good and loyall ſubiects and ſeruantes,
yea, euen againſt our Prelates, Biſhops, and other Cleargie
men, whō they haue impriſoned, robbed, ranſomed,
& by torment enforced to reſigne their benefices to their
partakers, without reſpect of deſert, or ſo much as quality,
as being contented that they were partakers in their wickednes,
with al other vnreaſonable means of hoſtility, rebellion,
and fellony, & al this vnder pretence and colour
of religion & godlines, as if themſelues could ſo much as
once approch to ours, or to that of ſo many good & honorable
perſons, whom they perſecute as guilty, only becauſe
they be their kings faithful ſeruantes and ſubiects, &
wil not damne thēſelues, or haue any portiō in their deteſtable
rebellion ſtil hauing in their mouthes that vvhich
is fartheſt from their harts, making a vaile and cloake of
Gods honor thereby to reſiſt his expreſſe vvord, and by
their ambition, fellony, and treacherie, to ſubuert the Catholicke,
Apoſtolicke, and Romiſh religion, as heretofore
they haue ſundrie times done, by ſeaſing vpō our tovvnes
& munitions, therby to diuert & hinder vs vvhen vve vver

beſt diſpoſed and moſt reſolute in our owne perſon to
warre vpon the heretickes, as alſo they would be very ſory
there ſhould be no more in France, leaſt thereby their
ambitious purpoſes ſhould haue no farther colour.
            And albeit through Gods grace we be not bound to
geue accompt of our actions to any but himſelfe, yet to
the ende the ſimplicitie of ſome of our ſubiectes be not
through their falſe ſuggeſtions abuſed and that they
ſhould wrongfully imagine the late Duke of Guiſe to
haue bene puniſhed for being the protector and defender
of the Catholicke Apoſtolicke and Romiſh Religion,
or for his good affection to the commons, and that in
reſpect thereof the ſaid Duke of Mayenne, Duke and
Knight of Aumalle, and their aſſociates may haue had
great and lawfull occaſion to vnite themſelues, as well
for their own particular preſeruation, together with the
maintenaunce of Religion, as for the reuenge of him that
dyed for them, as they doe report whereby to ſtirre vp
and ſeduce our ſubiects and to cloake their ambitious
rebellion. Our pleaſure is thereby fullie to giue them,
to vnderſtand that wickedly they haue ſought to couer
their diſloyaltie with the honour of God, the increaſe of
Religion and affection to the common wealth: for not to
ſtay vpon the particularities of the ſaid Duke of Guiſe
and his brothers liues, the memory whereof is but to
freſh yet in this Realme, eſpecially among ſuch as were
beſt acquainted with them, & not to waſt ſo much time
about the writing thereof, it ſhall ſuffiſe vs onely to ſay
that a few daies before the Duke of Guiſes death, the ſaid
Duke of Mayenne ſent vs word by an honorable Knight,
Syr Alphonſo Corſe, whom he ſent to vs, that it was not
enough for his brother to weare beades about his necke,
but that alſo it was requiſite he ſhould haue a ſoule or
conſcience: that we ſhould looke well to our ſelues: that
it were good himſelfe the ſayd Duke of Mayenne, or the

ſaid Knight ſhould come to aduertiſe vs, and that the
terme was ſo ſhort, as it was to be feared he could not
arriue time enough. As alſo we haue not loſt the remembrances
and letters conteyning his practiſes and procuring
of amitie with the king of Nauarre, aud the heretickes,
as well within the Realme as without, vpon what
ſoeuer conditions in caſe they would promiſe him their
amitie and aſſiſtance for his eſtabliſhment.
            It is likewiſe ſufficiently knowen what penſions he
receaued from ſtraungers, vpon what promiſes, and to
what end: & his confederates with ſuch as he did moſt
condemne before men as fauorers of hereſie, are not vnknowen
to any, but thoſe that liſt not to know the ſame.
Theſe be thoſe notable actes that he hath taken out of
the liues of the Apoſtles and Gods commaundementes,
for the preſeruation of the Catholicke Apoſtolicke, and
Romiſh Religion and the relief of the people: whereas
contrariwiſe it is well knowen where abouts our armies
were employed, that our intent was this ſpring perſonally
to haue gone forward, and that there was no let in
vs, why the ſaid Duke of Mayne ſhould not warre vpon
the heretickes, as well as our deare and faithfull Coſin
the Duke of Neuers, who had yet continued our enterpriſe,
had not our forces bene diuerted by the ſaid Duke
of Mayenne and the Duke and Knight of Aumalle, as already
the ſaid Duke of Aumalle did the like the laſt yeare
by ſurpriſing our Townes in Picardie: and it may be ſaid
by the workes of their handes, that the Huguenots had
neuer found ſo great fauour, neither this poore Realme
ſuch miſery and oppreſſion, but in the ſoule and life of the
late Duke of Guiſe, the Duke of Mayenne, and the Duke
and Knight of Aumalle: As for the relief of the people let
the preſent eſtate of this Realme be conſidered, the loſſes
& deſtructions that it hath encurred ſince the yeare 1585
when the ſaid late Duke of Guiſe, with the aforeſaid of

Mayenne and Aumalle tooke armes againſt vs & our authoritie,
& let the iminent deſtruction of this realme be
deemed by ſuch occurrēces as haue happened ſince that
time, & ſo compared with the former yeares of 83. & 84.
as alſo the order that we had begon to take & eſtabliſhe
in this our ſayd Realm to the honor of God, & the eaſe of
our people, and agree their relief and the charges of the
warre with the actions of the ſaid late Duke of Guiſe, and
the aforenamed, who ſince that time neuer laid aſide
their weapons, ſometimes vnder one pretence & ſometimes
vnder an other, note alſo the countenaunce of the
ſayd late Duke of Guiſe and his aſsiſtantes when we, contrary
to his expectation, graunted vnto the deputies of
our Eſtats, the diſcharge and reductions of tallages to
the ſtate they were in An. 1576. alwayes prouided that
they would miniſter meanes to ſupply the ſtocke and ſatisfie
the enterteinement of the Royall dignitie and the
eſtate, and to proſecute the warre which they all had
ſo ſolemnely deſired and ſworne, wherein them ſelues
ſhould by our decree, haue the adminiſtration of the
coyne, as they had promiſed vs: for at that tyme on
the one ſide he diſſwaded vs from doing it, willing vs not
to abaſe our authority ſo far, but to make our ſelues to be
beleued, and on the other ſide he vrged his partakers to
proceede in ſuch their inſtant ſuites, yet not vpon any
earneſt deſire thereto, but rather to bring vs either into
neceſſitie or into hatred with our ſaid ſubiectes, with firm
reſolution, vpon our refuſall, to breake vp the Eſtates,
vpon ſo plauſible a grounde to the people and him ſelfe
to reape the honour and thankes for that whiche he
leaſt meant, reiecting vpon vs the enuie for that which
we extremely deſired: and whiche we did vpon our
great affection to the relief of our ſubiectes, ſo farre as
in vs might lye, and that the preſeruation of our Eſtate
woulde permitte, euen contrary to his aduiſe and

counſell, and all ſuch perſwaſions as he vſed either by
him ſelfe or his to the contrary.
            Alſo in reſpect of his behauiours toward vs, after
we had remitted and pardoned al his former tranſgreſſions,
his raſh arrogancie was growen to be ſuch, that
the opinions in our Counſell were no longer free, he
made him ſelfe to be beleeued. The execution alſo
of ſentences and iudgementes giuen in our ſoueraigne
Courtes, agaynſt the moſt lewde and guiltie in this
lande was deferred in that they could not be caught,
and yet were they ſafe in his trayne and chamber,
yea and he procured them to be lodged in our Court, ſo
as they were the honeſteſt men & moſt zealous Catholickes
of this Realme, if once they were his partakers:
And contrarywiſe the honeſteſt, and beſt Catholicque
was an hereticque, or at the leaſt a Politicque,
in caſe hee would not ſweare and take parte in
their treaſon.
            Hee likewiſe did all that hee might, that euerye
man might know (and it was one of his pollicyes) that
he could doe what hee would: and that we had euen
caſt our ſelues into his armes, ſo farre foorth
as to cauſe ſuch rumours to bee ſpread throughout
our Prouinces, and to face the Deputies of our Generall
Eſtates, whiche woulde not depende vppon
him, and alter their bookes at his pleaſure, albeit
there were but ouer manye ſuch choſen and nominated
through his violence. Witneſſe that dayly at ſet
houres there was in his chamber a Counſell holden of
matters propounded, alſo what ſhould be concluded
in the Eſtates by purchaſe, driftes or violence according
as the ſayd Duke of Guiſe and his partakers had reſolued,
euen in the face of the world, yea and he boaſted
of it, and that there was no greater ſafetie then in his protection,
likewiſe that it was a poinct of treaſon, to

be our faithfull ſeruant, giuing out as a badge of iniurie
this terme HE IS ROYALL, and for a badge of honor,
HE IS A GVISART. He ſought vniuſtly to command
ouer him, whom God had conſtituted in all authoritie,
& ſoueraign power ouer him, & endeuored by the meer
benefites, honors and authoritie, which his king had beſtowed
vpon him to take from him both crowne & life,
at the leaſt ſo ſoone as he had founde meanes ſomewhat
better to eſtabliſh his authoritie then as yet it was, if peraduenture
he could haue graunted vs ſo long life: for it
is moſt certaine and ſufficiently verified that he had already
taken ſuch order for his drifts that he accompted him
ſelfe Maiſter of our Caſtle and perſon, yea he had vnlawfully
ſeaſed vpon the keyes, euen of our Chambers: The
cōuenient weapons for the execution of his practiſe and
vnfit for any other warrelick exploict were found, albeit
his fauorers had vſed all meanes to conuey them away, ſo
to take away all notice thereof, and his men were round
about vs. The companies of our ordinaunces whom we
had ordeyned for the ſafetie of our ſelues, and our eſtates
were by him diſmiſſed, yea ſo farre did he proceede as by
his letters ſigned by himſelfe and ſealed, with his ſeale of
armes, the inhabitantes of Remorantine were exempted
from receauing a part of the Lord of Souurays companie
whom we had there ordeyned: as alſo he tooke them into
his protection and ſafegarde, contrary to our letters
patentes vpon the partition, that we had made with him
ſelfe: expreſſely forbidding the generall Commiſſarie for
victuals, throughout our Realme, to take from them any
victuals, for the ſaid company or any other.
            Againe the more to ſhewe that he would no longer
depend vpon any other then him ſelfe, ſuch was his preſumption,
in the cloſet and preſence of the late Queene,
our moſt honorable Lady and good mother, and ſundry
other Princes and Lordes there preſent, as when the treſpaſſes

of treaſons came to be propounded, to the ende to
be renewed and ſworne vnto in full aſſembly of our Eſtats,
to aunſwere vs moſt impudently that he would not
doe any thing, neither would ſweare thereto: but that if
he tranſgreſſed we ſhould cauſe him to be puniſhed: and
yet all this notwithſtanding, together with diuers others
warninges of his driftes and dealinges, dayly giuen vs by
our good, faithfull and loyall ſubicts and ſeruaunts, we
paſſed ouer all theſe thinges quietly, as perſwading our
ſelues that our great patience and benefites, wherein we
ſpared not any one gratification that lay in our power,
to them and theirs, would mollifie the hardneſſe of their
hartes, and reduce them to their iuſt obedience due vnto
vs, conſidering the fierceneſſe of Lyons, and other the
moſt wild beaſtes is commonly tamed by benefites: but
as the ambitious deſire to raigne is inſatiable and infinite,
and that he that offendeth doth neuer forgiue: ſo theſe
mens inſolencies daily increaſed, and by an expreſſe meſſenger
whō the ſaid D. of Aumalle ſent vs vve were aduertiſed
that himſelfe had bene preſent in perſon, but not
in will (ſaid he) in a counſell holden at Paris, wherein
it was reſolued that the Duke of Guiſe ſhould feaſe vpon
our perſon and bring vs to Paris, which notwithſtanding,
we would not vpon our firſt conſiderations haue
ſuch reſpect to this aduice as we ought: howbeit vpon
the view of him whom ſince the aforeſaid D. of Mayenne
ſent vnto vs, ſeeing alſo the terme ſo ſhort as there was
no ſafetie for vs, but in the preuention of the liues of thoſe
who ſought to take away ours, and to vſurpe our eſtate
and Crowne: we were forced to vſe and practiſe vpon
their perſons, not what through their treacherous felonie
they deſerued, but according as the ſeaſon would
bear that which we ought, yet would not haue done.
            This was the recompence that they had prepared for
our gratifications and benefites, and is at this day proſecuted

by theſe, who during their liues ſeemed to condēne
their counſels, and did themſelues giue vs vvarning of the
ſame, to the end (as we do finde by their workes) to reſerue
to themſelues, and to turne to their particular profit the
fruite of this ambitious drift of empire, according to this
ancient prouerbe. If equitie be violable, it is to be violated
for a Kingdome, and either we haue no iudgement, or
els by their actions we muſt beleeue as they nowe do
agree together to take from vs our life and crown, which
GOD hath giuen vs, ſo ſhortlie they would haue ſcattered
it, or els fallen a debate among themſelues, who
ſhoulde emoy that which they ſeeke ſo vniuſtlie to vſurpe,
in caſe they had any opportunitie to inuade it:
as hauing already vndertaken authoritie to diſpoſe, and
by letters patentes to determine of the gouernement of
out prouinces, and of the leueying and diſtributing of
our treaſure.
            But ſeing pacience ought to be limitted and reſtrained
within certaine boundes, beyond the which it can
not be cōmendable in a Prince that oweth the preſeruation
of his honor, authoritie, & life vnto his eſtate and him
ſelfe. We vpō theſe cauſes with other iuſt conſiderations
vs moouing, with the aduiſe of the Princes of our blood,
the Cardinals, Prelates, Lords, and others of our Counſel,
haue declared, and by theſe preſentes ſigned with our
owne hande doe declare the ſayd Duke of Mayenne and
Duke and Knight of Aumalle to be fallen from all their
callinges, offices, honors, authorities, gouernementes,
charges, dignities, priuiledges and prerogatiues which
heretofore they haue had and holden ofvs or our predeceſſours
kings of this land: & that all the ſame we haue &
do at this preſent reuoke: alſo we haue and do denounce
and declare them infidels, rebels, attaint aud conuict of
rebellion, fellony and treaſon in the higheſt degree: farther
our pleaſure is that as ſuch they be proſecuted, both

they and all that ſhall aſsiſt them with victuals, counſell,
comfort, aide, ſtrength or goods what ſoeuer: likewiſe againſt
all their poſteritie by all meanes and rigours of the
ſtatutes made againſt ſuch tranſgreſsions. Onleſſe by the
firſt day of March next enſuing the date hereof, without
further delay they confeſſe their fault and returne into
that obediēce, which iuſtly they own vnto vs, euen by the
cōmaundement & expreſſe word ofGod, withſtandyng
the which, they can not terme themſelues Chriſtiās to the
end wee ſatisfye our ſelues in that we haue not omitted
any one curteſie, clemency, or fauour that might reclaime
thē frō their offence & reduce thē to their duety. Enioyning
our chief vſhers, ſergeants or other officers to ſignifie
vnto them theſe preſents either perſonally & together or
particularly: Alſo in caſe with ſafety they cā not do it, our
wil & pleaſure is that the notice therof made at the gates
or walles of their dwellings, or of the townes or ſuburbes
wherein they ſhall chance to be, by our chief trōpetter: or
if he can not ſafely for this purpoſe come ſo neare them,
in the next borrough or village, ſhalbe effectuall and of
as great force and ſtrength, as if it were done to their
owne perſons. Moreouer we commaunde and adiure
all our good, faithfull and loyall ſubiectes, of what
ſoeuer callyng or condition they bee, by that loyaltie
which iuſtly they owe vnto vs, which alſo God and their
honour doe commaund, and by the aſhes and memory of
their forefathers, who ſo many yeares and with ſo great
paines, ſweat & labor haue purchaſed thē that precious
treaſure, and immortall name of moſt faithfull to their
Kings, that in this affaire of ſuch importance as is the preſeruation
or ſubuerſion, not onely of our authority, but of
chriſtian religion, the ſtate & thēſelues, they ouerrun the
ſaid infidels and rebelles, and aſsiſt vs with their forces
& power & drawe vnto vs vpon the firſt ſommons to the
end to puniſh ſuch as wilfully vvil perſiſt in their rebelliō

            ¶THE KINGES DECLARATION
vpon the Riot, Felonie, and Rebellion of the Townes
of Paris, Orleance, Amyens and Abbeuille, with other
their adherents.
            
               HENRY by the grace of God king
ofFraunce and Polande, to all
men preſent and to come, greetyng.
God who of his deuine
goodneſſe of nothing hath created
man to his owne ſimilitude,
and all thinges to ſerue
him: The ſame God hath alſo
conſtituted kinges withall authoritie
and ſoueraigne power ouer the nations, whom
he hath giuen thē to rule & gouern: with this good order
that they ſhall obey what ſoeuer they ſhall be commanded,
and the Prince ſhall commaund what ſoeuer his
pleaſure, as to his ſubiectes, in ſuch maner as it can not be
denied, but that he that diſobeyeth his lawfull and naturall
Prince, reſiſteth the expreſſe word of God: & he that
fulfilleth not his commaundements and yet termeth him
ſelfe his ſonne, is a lyer.
            Now among all kinges inſtituted by God, we through
his grace beare the title of Moſt Chriſtian, and be the
chiefeſt of all Chriſtian Kinges, as alſo the Frenchmen

haue euermore bene noted aboue all natiōs in the world,
to haue bene moſt faithfull and loyall ſeruants and ſubiectes
to their kings, and to that Royall dignitie which
God of his grace hath giuen vs, together with the ſword
of povver, for the preſeruation of the good and the puniſhment
of the vvicked: hereto haue vve added all
the fauours and benefites, all the giftes, grauntes and
honours, wherewith we haue bene able to beautifie enrich
and augment our Tovvnes of Paris, Orleance, Amyens
and Abbeuille, and neuer denyed thē any thing
that might tend to their relief and increaſe, thereby
to conteyne and ſtill moue them more and more, to
that obedience vvhich iuſtly they owe vnto vs: But as
the horſe pampered vp vvith the care and charges that
his maſter hath beſtovved vpon him to haue him vvell
tended, doth kicke his benefactor, onely becauſe he
is too fat and hath bene too vvell vſed, and therefore
vvill not ſuffer his maſter to take his backe, ſo the ſaid
Townes of Paris, Orleance, Amyens and Abbeuille,
through our great fauour aboue all the Tovvnes in this
our realme& by enioying to much liberty haue in contempt
of Gods commaundementes, and of too great
ingratitude taken armes & riſen againſt vs their naturall
and lawfull king, endeuoring by their treacherie to
depriue vs of our liues & authoritie, in recompence of
our liberalities, & becauſe vve had exalted them aboue
their deſertes. Howbeit in conſideration that the ſimplicitie
of ſome may haue bene ſeduced through falſe
ſuggeſtions, and vnder pretence of pietie or Religion:
vvaying alſo the innocencie of others vvhich inhabite
the ſame townes, & yet were no partakers in ſo damnable
coūſels, to the end not to vndoe the good through
the wickednes of the bad: Al theſe conſiderations, together
with our naturall clemency had procured vs not
onely to forget all matters paſt, but alſo of our ſelues to

ſeek vnto thoſe that had ſo grieuouſly offended vs, to the
end to haue receiued them into our fauour, and to haue
cheriſhed & embraced them as our good and loyal ſubiects,
vpon the confeſſion of their faults, & ſuch ſubmiſſion
as iuſtly they owe vnto vs: But in liew of acknowledging
their errours and humbling themſelues, as men
forſaken of God for their contempt and diſobedience againſt
his expreſſe commandement, and vpon their
Felonye and Riot committed againſt their lavvfull and
naturall Kinge, they haue ſpitte their venoume againſt
the Biſhoppes, Prelates, Magiſtrates, Nobilitie,
and al ſorts of people vvithout diſtinction or conſideration
of calling or crime, onlie becauſe that obeying the
expreſſe vvord of God, they remained faithfull to their
prince, and vvould not with them become rebelles and
infidels to God and their king: yea they exceeded ſo far
as to kill and violently to diſmiſſe the Curates of their
charges only for exhorting the people to praye to God
for their king: & as the ſaid townes are extreme in their
treacheries, fellonies, and rebellions, ſo haue they not to
this hower fogottē or abſteined frō any one iot of crueltie,
no not of ſacriliege: and yet wil they do worſe in caſe
they be not preuented by puniſhments worthy their fellony
and deteſtable rebellion. We vpon theſe cauſes
with other iuſt conſiderations therunto vs mouing, haue

Prelats, Lords & others of our counſell, declared, &
by theſe preſents ſigned with our owne hand, do declare

fallen frō all eſtats, honors, power, gouernment, charges,
dignities, priuiledges, gifts or graunts what ſoeuer they
haue had of vs or other the kinges our predeceſſors, all
vvhich vve haue and at this preſent doe reuoke. And vve
haue denounced and declared and do denounce and declare
thē to be rebels attaint, and conuict of the crimes of

Riot, Felonie and Treaſon, in the higheſt degree. Alſo vve
vvill that as ſuch they be proceeded againſt, as vvell they
as al thoſe that do inhabite among them or ſhal aſsiſt thē
vvith victuals, counſell, comfort, aid, force, or goods, and
againſt their poſteritie, by all meanes and rigours of any
ordinances made againſt the ſaid tranſgreſsions: vnles by
the 15. day of the moneth of March next enſuing the date
hereof, they acknowledge their treſpaſſe, and returne into
the obedience that iuſtlie they ovve vnto vs, euen by
the commandement and expreſſe vvord of God, contrarie
to the which, they cannot be called Chriſtians.
            Further vpon the ſame penalties enioyning all officers

the preiudice of theſe preſentes: whereby we commaund
our chief vſher, ſergeaunt or other officer, to ſignifie vnto
them either ioyntly or ſeuerally theſe preſentes: Alſo in
caſe they can haue no ſafe acceſſe thereto, we will and
our pleaſure is, that the ſignification or placardes thereof

the preſeruation or ſubuertion, not onely of our
authoritie but alſo of Chriſtian Religion, the ſtate, and
them ſelues, that they ouerrunne the ſaid traytors and rebelles,

draw vnto vs vppon our firſt ſummons, to puniſhe all
ſuch as will perſiſt in their treaſons, and to reſtore our
authoritie together with our eſtate into their former
eminencie and dignitie to the honour ofGod, the preſeruation

Religion and the relief of our ſubiectes, wherein we
