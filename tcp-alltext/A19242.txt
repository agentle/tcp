               DEare Countreymen and ſeduced brethren, I religiouſly proteſt, I honour ſome of you; and loue all of you. Grieuing in my very ſoule: that you, and I, acknowledging one and the ſelfe ſame true God, cannot hit vpon the worſhiping of him after one and the ſelfe ſame true manner: Oh that I might liue to ſee the day wherein we might agree in one! But I haue ſmall hope to ſee it, as long as you ſuffer your Prieſt, to bring you in bondage, to deuoure you, to take your goods: as the 2. Cor. 11. 20Corinthians ſuffered the falſe Apoſtles to ferue them.—Por, as the Eſay. 9. 16.

A DIALOGVE BETWIXT A PROTESTANT AND A PAPIST: Wherein is manifeſted, the Papiſts Brag, that Scripture maketh for them.
            
               Proteſtant.
               
                  OH well met once againe! where haue you bin that I neuer ſaw you ſince wee talked about Pope Ioane? Are you the ſame man for Religion, that you was then?
            
            
               Papiſt.
               Yea truely, or rather more reſolute, and confident.
            
            
               Prot.
               What new arguments haue you lighted on to increaſe your reſolution and confidence? for my part, I am euery day further out of loue with your Religion, then other.
            
            
               Pa.
               The Arguments which haue doubled my reſolution

and confidence are diuers, wherof the firſt is this: 
                     Allen Apology of the Seminaries, c. 5. f. 58That I find ſentence giuen for vs Catholikes againſt you Proteſtants in all the Tribunals of Gods Church, I finde that all the Writings of the Saints in Heauen profeſſe for vs.
            
            
               Prot.
               What? the Writings of the Prophets and of the Apoſtles? and of the Fathers in the Primitiue Church? and of the Councels? Doe you finde that all profeſſe for you?
            
            
               Pa.
               Yea, all of them: Campian, rat, 10.
                  
                  Quaecunque vel opera, vel fragmenta ſuperſunt eorum qui diſiunctiſsimis terris Euangelium ſeuerunt, omnes nobis vnam fidem exhibent quam hodie Catholici profitemur. There is not a booke, nor a piece of a booke extant, written by the firſt Preachers of the Goſpel, whenſoeuer, or how far ſo euer they liued one from another, but it giues witneſſe to the Catholike Faith which wee profeſſe at this day.

               Can you make proofe thereof vnto mee, and I will bee of your Religion?

               Prot.
               Say you ſo? Verily, and if the Scriptures be for you, I will be with you: for I like well of

But let mee tell you a word or two by the way, and they are theſe▪

               Yes: but I will vſe the exception in this caſe. The exception which I take is, that the wordes are cited out of a corrupt Tranſlation: for in the Greek, wherein Eccleſiaſticus was firſt written, there is no mention made of merit. To euery pitlifull act of goodneſſe giue place, for euery one ſhall find (not according to the merit of his works, but) according to his works, ſaith the Greeke.

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

               I will; and that by examples of ancienter, and later times. In ancient times one Father miſtooke the meaning of another. At this time, euen one of you conceiues differently of the meaning of the Fathers, from others of you: ſome ſaying, This is the meaning: others ſaying, not ſo; but this is the meaning.

                   &c. alledge the ſame Fathers to the contrary. I did not thinke the Fathers words had beene ſo ſubiect to different conſtructions. But I muſt put off the further diſpute about the Fathers, till our next meeting, which ſhalbe (God willing) erre long, while, God be with you, onely remember▪
                  
I pray you, that which is written: 1. Tim. 6. 3. 4. and 5. verſes, If any man teach otherwiſe, and conſenteth not to the wholeſome words of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and to the doctrine, which is according to godlineſſe. He is puft vp and knoweth nothing, but doteth about queſtions and ſtrife of wordes, whereof commeth enuie ſtrife, railings, euil ſurmiſings, Froward diſputations of men of corrupt mindes and deſtitute of the truth, which thinke that gaine is godlines: from ſuch ſeparate thy ſelfe.
