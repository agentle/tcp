olde, was ſent to Magdeburg, wyth Iohn Keynech, who hath prooued a worthy man, and by his vertue acquired high authority in his Countrye. There cōtinued ſince a conglutinate mutual loue betwixt Luther & Keynech, proceding either of agreement of nature, either of ſociety in chyldiſh ſtudy. And yet Martine ſtudied no lenger then one yeare at Magdeburg.
                  Departing from Magdeburge, he repaired to Iſenach, wher he ſtudied foure yeares vnder one Scholemayſter, who taught hym the Grammer more promptly and luckely, then any other. I haue heard Luther cōmende his wyt. He was ſent to thys towne, becauſe his Mother was borne in the ſame, of honeſt and auncient houſe. Here he atchieued his ſtudy in Grā

And it maye be ſome pleaſaunt ſtudy of true Philoſophie, and care to polyſh hys tonge, would haue mollefied hys natural vehemency. But at Erford, he met wyth the Dialectique of that tyme, the whych (by dexteritie and redynes of wytte, vnderſt andyng more exactly the cauſes & ſprynges of inſtruction, then others hys compagnions) he greedely deuoured, and had in memory.
                  And for that the excellencye of hys wyt embracing good litterature required many, & thoſe ſelected things: he priuately red diuers workes of the auncient latine Authors, as Cicero, Titus Liuius, Virgil, & others. He ſtudied not theſe as the yong ſcholers are wont, collecting onely the Phraſes, but as a doctrine or repreſentacion of humayne lyfe. And therfore intentiuely

applyed hym ſelfe, to vnder ſtande the ſence & ſentence of the Authors. And hauyng a naturall good memory, he had as it were before hys eyes preſt, all that he had learned, or hearde. He ſo excelled in hys younge yeres, that the whole Vniuerſity had hys wyt in great admiracion.

Wher he entreated admiſſion, & beyng admitted, he learned wyth marueilous diligence, not onelye the doctrine of the Couent: but alſo gouerned hym ſelfe wyth a great ſeueritye of diſcipline, and ſurpaſſed al other in all exerciſes

of Religion, in lections, in diſputacions, in faſtinges, and in prayers. He was naturally a ſmal feeder, wherat I haue muſed much, ſithe he was of ſtature tall and ſtrong of body. I haue conſidered in him this abſtinence:Incredible ſobriety. foure continual daies, when he was well diſpoſed and healthy, he would refraine from meate & drinke. And often tymes I haue ſeene, when a long ſeaſon he would dyet hym ſelf with a ſmall peece of breade and one hearyng.
                  The cauſe wherefore he addicted him ſelfe to this Monaſticall order ofWhat moued him to Monkery. life: was becauſe he beleued the ſame to be moſt conformable to ſincere religion, and to the vnderſtanding of Gods doctrine, as he hath related, & many hath knowen. Often tymes he was takē with great and trembling feares, when he attentiuely conſidered the wrath of God, & the marueylous examples of his puniſhmentes, that he was in a maner reft of hys wyttes. And I haue marked at a certaine tyme, that beyng ſore abaſhed in one diſputacion of thys doctrine, becauſe he gaue attentiue eare therevnto:

he was ſodēly forced to remoue into a nygh Chamber, & ther reſting on his bed, he medled & reported ofteHis abaſhmentes at the wrath of God. this ſentence: God hath ſhut vp al vnder our vnbelief, to the end he might extende mercye to all. Theſe abaſhmentes encreaſed after, but thē moſt aſperouſly he felt thē, whē he loſt hys deare friende & companion, who was ſtayne, I know not by what miſhap.
                  Then penurye pricked hym not to this Monkerye, but the affection he had to learne to ſerue God. Albeit he learned ther the doctrine vſed in ſcholes, he red the Doctors of ſentences, and in publick diſputacions, diſtinctly expreſſed the difficulties, which other could not vnfold, whereat many muſed: Neuertheles, for y• he ſought not in this kinde of lyfe to wyn brute according to the vertu of his wit, butHys ſtudie in the holy ſcripture. to noriſh him in the feare of God: he vſed theſe ſtudies, as one that eſteemed not to be principall of that he ſearched and eaſelye conceyued thoſe ſcholaſtical Methodes. In the meane ſeaſon he redde with great affection the fountaines of heauenly doctrine, that is, the Prophetes and Apoſtles,

therby to frame hys lyfe and conuerſacion to the wyll of God, and ſo be continued in the feare & faith of God, as by manye thynges it was apparent. Yea, howe muche the more earneſtly he coueted thys exerciſe, or holy contemplacion, ſo muche the more he was troubled wyth his dolour and abaſhment.
                  He declared he was manye tymesHe is comforted by an old mā. confyrmed by conference with an old man in the Couent of Auguſtines at Erphord. And impartyng hym wyth hys tremblyng feares, he learned many thynges touchyng fayth, and alſo told vs, he reaſoned wyth hym of that Article of the Simbole, whych is: I beleue the remiſſion of ſynnes. He expreſſed vnto Luther thys Article in
                        
                           •
                        re remiſſiō of ſins. thys ſort: We may not generally beleue onelye that ſynnes are or haue bene remitted to ſome, as the Deuils beleue, they were forgeuen Peter or Dauid: but that Gods expreſſe commaundement is, that euerye man ſhould beleue particularly his ſinnes are forgeuen. And further he ſayd, that thys interpretacion was confyrmed by the teſtimonies of Saynt Bernard,

& he had ſhewed hym the placeAn excellent declaracion of▪ ſ. Bernard touchyng fayth. in the Sermon of the Annunciacion, where it is thus ſet foorth: But adde that thou beleueſt this, y• by hym thy ſynnes are forgeuen the. This is the teſtimony, that the holy Ghoſt giueth thee in thy hart, ſaying: Thy ſyns are forgiuen thee. For this is the opinion of the Apoſtle, that man is freely iuſtified by fayth.
                  Luther ſayd he was not onely ſtrēgthened by theſe wordes: but ye he was alſo inſtructed of the ful meaning of ſaint Paule, who repeateth ſo many times this ſentence: We are iuſtified by fayth. And hauing read the expoſicions of many vpon this place: he thē perceued as wel by the purpoſe of the olde man, as by the comfort he receyued in his ſpirite, the vanity of thoſe interpretaciōs, which he had beſydes him. And reading by little and lyttle, with conferring the ſayinges and examples of Prophetes and Apoſtles, & continual inuocacion of God, and excitacion of fayth by force of prayers, he perceiued that doctrine more euidently.
                  Then he began to reade S. Auſtens

bookes, where he found many goodlyThe profit of ſ. Auſtins vokes ſentences, among other in the expoſicion of the Pſalmes, and in the booke of the Spirite and the Letter, which cōfirmed this doctrine of faith & conſolacion that was illumined in his hart. And yet he laid not a ſide the Sētenciaries. He could recite by rote word by word Gabriel and Cameracenſis. He red long tyme the bookes of Occan, & preferred his ſubtiltie aboue Thomas Aquin, and Scotus. He red alſo and reuolued Gerſō, but aboue al the reſt, he red and peruſed al ouer Saynt Auſtens workes, and committed them to perfect memory. And thus he beganne diligentlye to ſtudye at Erphord, where he continued foure yeares in the Couent of Auguſtines.

When he had conſidered the Spirite and erudition of Luther, he called

hym from Erphord, to place hym in Vitteberg, in the yeare. 1508. and of hys age .xxvi. There hys towardnes appeared in the ordinarye exerciſe of Schoole and predication. And as it happened that manye wyſe and learned men attentiuely heard Luther, namely the Doctor Meller

                  There fyrſt he expounded the dialectique and Phiſique of Ariſtotle, and in the meane whyle intermitted no whyt hys ſtudye in Theologye.

                     dent to hys profeſſion, and it plainly appeared his woordes were no lyppe labour, but proceded from the verye hart. Thys admiracion of his holye lyfe much inflected, and allured the hartes of his Auditours, and therfore many notable perſonages, familiarly

knowing hym, and ſeing him innouate the vſuall Ceremonies, reſiſted hym nothing, but in reſpect of the authority, he procured before (aſ wel for that he reueled many good matters, as that his lyfe was holye) conſented wyth him in his opinions, with the which they ſaw the world deuided diuerſly, and therfore were penſine and very ſore greued.
                  At thys tyme Luther altered nothing in the ceremonies, but preciſely obſerued hys rule among hys fellowes, he medled no doubtful opinions, but expreſſed thys common doctrine, as principalleſt of all other, in familiar maner to all men, elucidating the ſame more and more, to ſay the doctrine of repentaunce, of remiſſion of ſynnes, of fayth, of true comfort in times of aduerſity. Euery mā receiued good taſte of this ſwete doctrine, and the learned conceiued high pleaſure to behold Ieſus Chriſt, the Prophetes and Apoſtles come foorth into lyght, out of darkenes, pryſon, and other ordures, to vnderſtand the difference betwyxt the lawe and the Goſpell, betwyxt the promiſes of the

Law, and the promiſe of the Goſpel, betwixt ſpirituall Iuſtice, and ciuill thynges, whych certainlye could not haue bene found in Thomas Aquin, Scotus, nor hys ſemblables.
                  He conſidered this alſo, that many were inſtigated & ſolicited by Eraſmus learned woorkes, to ſtudye the Greeke and Latine tonges, who perceiuing a more gentle & ready order of teaching the before, began to haue in contempt the Monkes barbarous and ſophiſtical doctrine: and ſpecially ſuche as were of a gentle nature & good diſpoſicion. Luther began to ſtudy the Greke and Hebrue tonges, to thys ende, that after he had learned the phraſe & propriety of the tonges, & drawen the doctrine out of the very fountaynes, he myghte geue more ſound iudgement.
                  Whileſt Luther was in this courſe of ſtudy, a certaine Dominicke Friernanied Tecel, a moſt impudent Sicophant (if euer there raygned any) cauſed the Popes Indulgences or Pardons to he caryed and ſold about the Country. Luther, much moued wyth the blaſphemous ſermons this ſhameles

                  Thys beggarlye Friar alwayes lyke vnto hym ſelfe, hopyng to obtayne the Popes bleſſynge, aſſembled certayne Monkes and Deuines, meanelye ſeene in Sophiſtry, in hys Couent, and foorth wyth commaunded them to wryte ſomething againſt Luther. And whyleſt he would not ſeeme to be dombe, he beganne not onelye to inueye in hys Sermons, but to thunder agaynſt Luther, and balking out hys Aſinine brayde, cryed: Luther is an hereticke, and worthye to be perſecuted wyth the fyre,The ſclaū

to treate more amply of thinges, and to mayntaine the truth.
                  Beholde what were the begynnynges of thys controuerſye, wherein Luther neyther ſuſpecting ne dreamyng of anye chaunge that myghte happen in the ceremonyes, dyd not vtterly reiect the Indulgences, but required a moderacion in them. And therefore they falſelye accuſe hym, that blaſe he beganne wyth plawſible matter, and whereby he myghte get prayſe, to the ende in proceſſe of tyme, he myght chaunge the ſtate of the Common weale, and purchaſe authoritye, eyther for him ſelfe or other.

tryed truth, and termeth it a blaſphemy, horribly cōdempned of God, partinaciouſly to repugne the truth. He dyd that many wyſe and godly wold haue done, he obeyed God, leauyng vnto hym hys diuine power, he redde diligently that that was writen, and he would not abolyſh, that he iudged to be ſincere and true.
                  I know very wel he made inquiſicion often tymes, what wer the wiſe and learned mēs opinions touchyng theſe thinges. I knowe he gently beſought Eraſmus (in that aſſemblye whych Themperour Charles the fift made, in the City of Colein after his Coronacion) freely to tell hym hys opinion, if Luther had erred in thoſe differences, wherof he principally entreateth. Then Eraſmus ſayde, thatEraſmus approueth Luthers doctrine. Luthers opinion was good: but that he deſired moderation of ſtyle in him. Wherof Duke Frederick wrot after greuouſly to Luther, exhortyng hym to temper the vehemency of his ſtyle.
                  It is alſo apparēt, that Luther promiſed y• Cardinal Caietanus to kepe ſilence, prouided alſo his aduerſaries would do the lyke. Whereby we may

gather, that at that time he determined not to ſturre any newe debates, but rather coueted the cōmon quiet, and that he was prouoked by litle & lytle to other matters, throughe the excitacion of vnlearned writers.

As touching the queſtion of the Romain Biſhops power, Eccius was y• author thereof, & for none other reſpect, thē to inflame the fyry wrath of the Pope & Princes

Further he declareth in diuers his works ſufficiently, what innouaciō is to be required in y• ceremonies & tradiciōs of mē, & wherfore they ought to be altered. And what fourme of doctrine & adminiſtracion of the ſacraments he required & approued, it is apparēt by the confeſſiō the Elector Iohn Duke of Saxony, & Prince Phillip Landgraue of Heſſia preſented to themperor Charles the .v. in the yere 1530. in the aſſembly at Auſburg.

The eternal father pronounced thys voyce of hys ſonne: This is my welbeloued ſonne

heare hym. And menaceth eternall wrath to al blaſphemers, that is ſuch as endeuour to aboliſhe the manifeſt verity. And therefore Luther dyd as behoued a Chriſtian faithfully to do, conſidering he was an Inſtructor of the Church of God. It was hys office (I ſay) to reprehed pernicious errors whych Epicures table, wyth a monſtrous impudencye heaped one vpon an other, and it was expedient hys Auditors diſſented not from hys opinion, ſynce he taught purely.

                     Therfore whē I cōſider in my mind how many worthy men haue bene in the church, that in this erred, & were abuſed: I beleue aſſuredly y• Luthers hart was not onely gouerned by humayn diligence, but with a heauenly light, cōſidering how conſtantly he a bode wythin the limites of hys office.
                  He held not onely in contempt the ſedicious Doctours of that tyme, as Monetar us and the Auabaptiſtes: but alſo theſe horned Byſhoppes of Rome, who arrogantly & impudently by theyr deuiſed decrees affirmed, that Saynt Peter had not the charge alone to teache the Goſpell, but alſo to gouerne common weales, and exerciſe ciuil iuriſdiction.
                  Moreouer he exhorted euerye man to render vnto God that appertayned vnto God, and to Ceſar that belonged to Ceſar, to ſay that al ſhould ſerue God, wyth true repentaunce, knowledge and propagacion of hys true doctrine, inuocacion & workes, wrought wyth a pure cōſcience.

But I ſtay wholy here vpon, that the vniuerſal Churche, hath conſented perpetuallye to thys very doctrine, which is preached in our Church, where vnto we muſt frame our lyfe and deuocion conformable. And I beleue yt this is the doctrine,

wherof the ſonne of God ſpeaketh: If any loue me, he wyll keepe my commaundementes, and my father wyll loue him, and we wyll come to hym, and plant our dwelling with hym.

Sacramentes, the difference betwyxt the Goſpel and Philoſophy, the dignity of politike order, finally the principall articles of the doctrine conducible to the Church. He compoſed certayne workes to reproue, wherin he refuteth diuers pernicious errours.

The which, twoo thynges would ſet before myne eyes this ſentence of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, where by is ſayde Who ſo euer ſhall denye me before men, I will deny hym before my Father. I requyre then for thys cauſe, and humblye beſeche the Emperiall Maieſtye, to graunt me libertye and leaſure to deliberate, ſo that I maye ſatiſfye the interrogacion made vnto me, wythoute preiudice of the woorde of God, and peryll of myne owne ſoule.
                     Whereupon the Princes beganne to deliberate. This done, the Officiall pronounced what was their reſolucion, ſaying: All beit Martine Luther, thou haſt ſufficiently vnderſtanded by the Emperours commaundement, the cauſe of thy appellacion, & therfore doeſt not deſerue to haue oportunity geuen thee to determyne:

                     This done, Luther was led to hys lodging by the Heraulo, but hereinLuther is exhorted to be conſtant. I maye not be obliuious, that in the way going to the Emperour, & when he was in the aſſembly of Princes, he was exhorted of other to be couragious, and manly to demeane himſelfe, and not to feare them that can kil the body, but not the ſoule: but rather to dread hym that is able to ſende both bodye and ſoule to euerlaſtyng fyre. Further, he was emboldned wyth thys ſentence: When thou art before Kynges, thynke not what thou ſhall ſpeake, for it ſhall be geuen thee in that houre.
                     The next day after four of ye clock, the Heraulde came and brought Luther from hys lodgyng, to the Emperours Couet, where he abode tyi ſyxe

of the clocke, for that the Princes wet occupied with graue conſultacions; a biding there and beyng enuironned wyth a great nomber of people, and almoſt ſmothered for the preace that was ther. Then after, whē the Princes were ſet, and Luther entred: the Official begā to ſpeake in this maner

Further to the interrogacion by vs made, whether thou wouldeſt approue all that thou confeſſeſt in them, or aboliſhe & make boyde any part therof. Thou dyddeſt require tyme of deliberacion, whych was graunted, & is now expired. All beit thou oughteſt not to haue opportunity graunted to deliberate, conſidering it was notorious vnto thee, wherfore we accited thee. And as concerning the matter of faith, euery mā ought to be ſo prepared, that at all tymes when ſo euer he ſhal be required, he may geue certen and conſtant reaſon thereof, and thou the rather ſo highly learned, & long tyme exerciſed

Wylt thou now maintayne all thy bookes which thou haſt acknowledged, or reuoke any part of them? or ſubmit and yelde thy ſelfe? The Officiall made thys interrogacion in Latine and in Dutche.

Embaſſadour, who made ſemblant of good wyll to checke Luther: ſayde that Luther had not aunſwered to any purpoſe, neither it behaued him to cal in queſtion, thinges in tyme paſt condempned and defined by generall Councels. And therfore they required of hym a playne and no crooked aunſwer, whether he

would reuoke or no.
                     Then Luther aunſwered: Conſidering that your ſoueraigne MaieſtyLuthers abſolute anſwer. and your Honours requyre a playne aunſwer, I wyll geuethe ſame, neyther crooked ne contumelious in this maner: that if I be not conuinced by teſtimonies of the ſcriptures, and by probable reaſon (for I beleue not the Pope, neither general Councels) be ouercome in the ſcriptures alledged by me, and the certitude therof is not found in the word of God, I wil not, nor I may not reuoke any manner of thing, conſidering it is not godlye ne lefu

                     The Princes conſulted together vpon this aunſwere geuen by Luther, And when they had diligently examined the ſame, the Officiall of Triers Embaſſadour of the Empyre, began to repel hym thus.

And wheras the general Councels haue ordeyned certain thynges, thoſe therefore not to be tru, for that thei haue erred, & often tymes gaynſayd them ſelues, & for thys cauſe the enemyes argument was of no ſolidity. Further, he was able to prooue, and would conſtantly ſtand to the tryall the Councels had erred, and it was not meete for hym to reuoke and dyſanull that which is manifeſt, and diligently ſet forth in the Scripture.

And albeit they had greatly erred, yet their aucthoritye was not therfore abaſed, or at the leaſt not ſo erred, that it was lawfull for euerye man to impugne their opinions. Further, he alledged certayne thinges of Zacheus & the Centurion, of the decrees and tradicions of men, & of the ceremonies ordeined, affirmyng that al theſe were eſtabliſhed to repres the vices, according to the quality & reuolucion of tymes, and that the Church could not be deſtitute of humayn conſtitucions. Further, that the tree is knowen by the fruit, the lawes haue much profited, and S. Martin, Saint Nicholas, and many other Sayntes haue aſſiſted the Councels.

                     Luther aunſwered humbly and modeſtly, he coulde not, neyther woulde permit that men ſhould ſay he would thunne the iudgement of the Emperour, Princes, & ſupreme Eſtates of the Empyre, weying ſo ſ

And that the word of God made ſo much for hym, and was ſo manyfeſt vnto hym, that he woulde not geue place, vnles they

taught ſound doctrine, then the word of God. And y• S. Au

                            onely true. to thoſe bookes, which are called Canonicall, that he beleued them to be true And as touching the other Doctors, albeit in holynes and excellency of learning, they paſſed, he would not credit them, vnles they pronounced truth. Further, that Sayncte Paule had wrytten to the Theſſalonians, proue all things, folow that is good. And to the Galathians: although an Aungel ſhould deſcend from heauen, if he preach otherwyſe, let him 
                           •

                           •
                        andes of the woorde of God and holy ſcripture, to deny that ſame excellent word. And thus he cō
                        mended hys cauſe and hym ſelfe to them, and ſpecially to the Emperors Maieſtye, requiring their helpe, he myghte not be compelled to do anye thyng in thys matter agaynſte hys conſcience. And otherwyſe he would ſubmyt hym ſelfe in all cauſes moſt obedientlye.
                     
                        And anſwering thus, Ioachime Elector, Marques of Brandeburge, demaunded if he had ſayd he would not yelde, vnles he were conuinced wyth the ſcripture Yea trulye ryght noble Lord (quoth Luther) or els by auncient and euident reaſons.
                     Thus the aſſemble brake, and the Princes repayred to the Emperours court. The Archbiſhop of Triers abode, accompanied with hys Official Iohn Ecke, & Cochleus, & cōmaūded Luther to come into hys chamber, Ierome Schurff, & Nicholas Ambſdorff aſſiſted to mayntaine Luthers cauſe. Then the Official began to frame an argument like a Sophiſt & Canoniſt, defending the Popes cauſe: That for the moſt part at al tymes holy ſcriptures haue engendred errors, as theFalſe argumentes for y• Pope ſame of Heluidius the Arian, out of that place in the Goſpel, where is expreſſed, Ioſeph knew not his wyfe til ſhe was deliuered of her fyrſt chylde. Further, he grew to ouerthrow thys propoſiciō, that the Catholik Church is the Cōmunion of Sayntes, preſuming alſo of Cocle to make wheat, & of bodily excremēts to cōpact mēbers.
                     
                        Martin Luther & Ierome Schurffe reproued theſe folyes, & other vaine and ridiculous matters, whych Ecke brought forth but modeſtli, as things not ſeruing to the purpoſe. Somtyme Cochleus would entermedle his murmuring chattes, and laboured to perſwade Luther, to deſiſt from hys purpoſe, & vtterly to refraine thenceforth to wryte or teach, & ſo they departed.
                     About euening, the Archbyſhop of Triers, aduertiſed Luther by Ambſdorff, the Emperours promiſe made vnto him, was prolonged two daies, & in the meane ſeaſon he would conferre wyth him the next daye, and for that cauſe he woulde ſende Doctour Peutinger & the Doctor of Bade the morrow after to hym, and he himſelf would alſo talke with hym.
                     The Friday then that was Saynt Markes day, Peutinger, & the Doctor of Bade trauailed in the forenone
                           
                              〈…〉
                           . to perſwade Luther ſimply and abſolutely to ſubmit the iudgement of his writinges to Themperor & Empire. He aunſwered he would do & ſubmyt any thing they woulde haue hym, ſo they grounded with the authoritye of

holy ſcripture, otherwyſe he woulde not conſent to do any thing. For god ſayd by his Prophet (ſaith he:) Truſt ye not in Princes, nor in the children of men, in whom there is no health. Alſo, curſed be he that truſteth in me And ſeyng them vrge him more vehemently, he aunſwered: We ought to ſubmit no more to the iudgement of men, then the word of God doth. So they departed, and prayed hym to aduiſe for better aunſwer, and ſaid they would returne after Dynner.
                     After Dynner they returned, exhortyng as before, but in vayne. They prayed him at the leaſt he would ſubmit his writyng to the iudgement of the next general Councel. Luther agreed therunto, but wyth this condicion, that they them ſelues ſhoulde preſent ye Articles collected out of his bookes to be ſubmitted to the Councel, in this maner, notwythſtandyng that the ſentence awarded by the coū
                        cel, ſhould be authoriſed by the ſcripture, and prooue the contrary wyth the teſtimonies of the ſame.
                     Then leauing Luther, they departed and reported to the Archbiſhop of

Triers that he had promiſed to ſubmyt hys wrytings in certayn articles to the next Coūcel, and in the meane ſpace he would kepe ſilence, whyche Luther neuer thought, who neyther wyth admonicions, ne yet menaces could be induced to denye or ſubmyt hys bookes to the iudgements of mē, he ha

                         coulde prooue by ſacred Scripture and apparent reaſons he had erred.
                     It chaunced then by y• ſpecial grace of god, that the Archbiſhop of Triers ſent for Luther, reſolued preſently to heare hym. And when he perceiued otherwiſe then Peutinger, & the Doctor of Bade had tolde hym, he affirmed that Luther ſhould not haue reuoked for a great deale, that he had ſayd, vnles he had heard him ſpeake, but that ſtraight he would haue gone to the Emperour, and declared what the Doctors had reported.
                     Then the Archbyſhop treated andFamiliar talke betwene the archbiſhop & Luther. conferred wyth Luther very gently, fyrſt remouyng ſuch as wer preſent, as well of the iudgement of the Emperor

and Empire, as of the ſentence of the next general Councell. In this conference Luther conceled nothyng from the Archbiſhoppe, affirmyng it was daungerous to ſubmyt a matter of ſo great importance to them, who after they had called hym vnder ſafeconduct, attempting hym wyth newe commaundementes, condempned his opinion, and approued the Popes Bull.
                     Moreouer, the Archbyſhop bedding a friend of hys drawe nygh, required Luther to declare what remedye myghte bee miniſtred to helpe thys. Luther aunſwered: There was no better remedy, then ſuche as Gamali

                        The Archbiſhoppe enquired of hym what he would do, if certain articles wer taken out of his bookes to be ſubmitted to the generall Councell. Luther aunſwered: So that they be not thoſe, which the councel of Conſtāce condempned. The Archbiſhop ſayd I feare they wyll be the very ſame: but what then? Luther replied: I wyl not nor I cannot hold my peace of ſuche,

                     Then the Archbiſhop, ſeing Luther would in no wyſe ſubmit the word of God to the iudgement of men, gently bad Luther farewell, who at that inſtant prayed y• Archbiſhop to entreate the Emperours Maieſtye to graunt hym gracious leaue to depart. He anſwered: he would take order for hym, and ſpeedelye aduertiſe the Emperours pleaſure.
                     And within a ſmal whyle after, the Archbiſhops Offical, in the preſence of the Emperours Secretarye, who was Maximilians Chauncelour, ſaid

And that it was the Emperours ordinaunce, he ſhoulde wythin .xx. dayes, returne ſecurely

                     Luther hauing vnderſtanded thys, aunſwered very modeſtlye & Chriſtianly: Euen as it hath pleaſed God, ſo is it come to paſſe, the name of the Lorde be bleſſed. He ſayd further, he thanked moſt humbly the Emperors Maieſty, & all the Princes & Eſtates of the Empire, that they had geuen to hym benigne & gracious audience, and graunted ſafeconduct to come & to returne.

Paules doctrine, whych treateth, ma is iuſtified by fayth. He hath expreſſed what difference is betwyxte the Law & the Goſpel, betwixt ſpiritual & ciuil Iuſtice. He hath explaned what is the true inuocacion of God, and reuoked the Church wholy from al Pagane and prophane lunacy and furor, who fayne that God is inuocated, when the ſpirites oppreſſed wyth Academical douts, flee God.

For he is eaſy to the faythful & godly, and ſuch as be of ſound vnderſtandyng, & ſclaunderouſlye wyll not geue iudgement, by conference of ſentences to cō

                     But ſome (which wer not peruers) haue compiayned that Luther wasLuthers vehemēcie excuſed. more vehement, then n
                           •
                        de required. I wyl not diſpute againſt any: but I aunſwer this that Eraſmus hath often ſaid: God hath giuen this laſt age a ſharpe Phiſiciō, becauſe of y• great diſeaſes of the ſame, & therfore ſynce he hath reyſed ſuch an organe againſt the truthes enemies, and agaynſt the proude and impudent, as he hath ſaid to Ieremy, beholde I haue placed my wordes in thy mouth, to thende thou ſhouldeſt deſtroy & edefye, & alſo hath pleaſed hym to ſet before their beards this Gorgon or buckler, in vaine thei quarell wyth God. God gouerneth hys Church not by mans Counſels, netheir wyll haue hys organes all alyke. This is a common thing, mean and moderate ſpirites cannot brooke vehement motions, whether they be

good or euyll. Ariſtides beholdynge Themiſtocles enterpriſe great matters, wyth a patheticall incitacion of the minde, wherof he had proſperous ſucceſſe, althoughe he dyd gratulate the cōmon weales prſperity: yet he laboured diligētly to reuoke Themiſtocles vehement mynde from y• courſe.
                     Neyther I deny that ſometymes vehement mocions offend, ther is none in thys infirmity of Nature, voide of ſpot. Yet if ther be any ſuch as the autentick writers haue reported of Hercules, Cimon, and other, deformed & miſſhapen: yet apt and vpryght in excellent exploictes. Certaynly I muſt confeſſe that theſe be good and praiſe worthy, and as S. Paule ſayth, yf he do hys duty wel in the Church, obſeruyng fayth, and a pure conſcience, he is acceptable to God, and we oughte to reuerence hym.
                     We knowe that Luther hath bene ſuch, for conſtantly he hath mayntained the ſinceritye of the Goſpel, and retayned an integrity of conſcience. Now what is he (that hath knowen Luther) & is ignoraunt, wyth whatLuthers humanity humanity he was garniſhed? How af

fable he was to al ſuch as in familiar conference, or graue deuiſe had to do wyth hym. How voyde he was of contencion & brawle, & yet among theſe vertues he had ſuch a grauity, as decently became hys callyng. His manners wer good, his wordes ſwete and pleaſaunt. Finally, althinges (as S. Paule ſaith) wer in him true, honeſt, iuſt, pure, amiable, & renoumed, in ſo much that we maye plainly perceyue hys vehemencye proceded of a zelous affection he bare to the truth, rather then of any natural ſharpenes, & here of not onely we, but many are euidēt witneſſes. As touching the reſt of hisLuthers integrity. lyfe, whyche hee prolonged to .lxiii. yeares, employing the ſame with feruent affection in the feare of God, & in al good & liberal ſcieces, if I had deliberated to ſay ought in hys prayſe, what ample theame, what abundāce of matter is miniſtred to me to frame an excellent & goodly Oratiō. No inordinate deſires, no ſedicious coūſels raigned in him. He exhorted to peace & diſſwaded war. He medled not priuate care wt eccleſiaſtical cauſes, ther by to enrich himſelf, or aduaunce hys friendes.

I iudge this to be ſo great wyſdome & vertue, that by humayne diligence it cannot onely be procured, but it behoueth high, vehement, & ſubtil mindes (as it appeareth Luthers was) to be brydeled diuinely.
                     What ſhal I ſaye of other his vertues? I often tymes came vnwaresLuthers earneſt prayers. vpon hym, when he wyth teares berayning hys chekes, prayed for the vniuerſal Church. He preſcribed certayn houres euery day to recite ſome Pſalmes, and in pronouncing them, he expreſſed his affection, wyth mourning & teares. He rebuked euer thoſe that through negligence, or other domeſtical buſines, ſayde: they ſerued God ſufficiently, in makyng a ſecret zelous prayer, declaring to them that we haue fourmes ſet foorth by diuine counſell, to thend that in reading we may awaken our myndes, and wyth voyce teſtify what God we call vpon.
                     And when occaſion was offered to enter in conſultacion about imminent daungerous, we alwaies obſerued hys marueilous conſtancy of courage, neyther would he lurke appalled, neyther repreſent anye face ef

feare, wyth the terrour therof. He leaned alwayes to the Lord, as to hys holye ancre, and neuer waued in anye poynt of hys fayth.
                     Further, he was ſo ingenious, that alone he conſidered what was neceſſarySubtilty of hys Spirite. to be done in doubtful caſes. Neither was he (as many ſuppoſe) negligent in the conſideracion of the publicke weale, neyther ignoraunt of the myndes and inclinaciōs of other, but he wel vnderſtode the ſtate of the common weale, no man better, & perceyued moſt prudently the natural diſpoſitions and wylles of them, with whō he was cōuerſant.

                  You may not here Agathy ſay: Is it poſſible that Zuinglius yet a Papiſt, ſhoulde thynke of the Goſpell? Credite mee, it is more then .xxvii. yeares paſt, ſynce theſe Blocke heads charged him ſecretelye to be an heritik, as wel for thys that is rehearſed,

as for that he approued Iohn Picus of Mirandolas propoſitions, ſet vp at Rome by him in time paſt to diſpute, the whych notwithſtandyng he could not obtayne. Hereof ſprang the hatred, infamy, exclamacion, and wyly working of the children of the world agaynſt Zuinglius, & encreaſed euen as hys vertues augmēted. The other contrarely that were godly affectioned, as ſome auncient and vertuous perſonages, wyth certain Prieſtes of a leſſe corrupt lyfe, eſteemed hym ſo hyghly, as they truſted by hys endeuor, the iuſtice & integrity of the aunceſtors ſhould be remiſed in their old eſtate. At that time he announced the grace of the Goſpell, in ſorte, that he ſayd lyttle of the abuſes of Rome, or nothing at al. For he thought it was neceſſarye that truth fyrſte knowen, ſhould worke in the hartes of hys auditors, ſo that when they had wel vnderſtanted the true cōntaundements, they myght diſcerne the falſe and repugnaunt. And truly, ſuche was the qualitye of time, he could doo none other. For in this contrariety of opinions and rebellion of people, the truth

Thus Zuinglius demeaned hym ſelfe at Glaris. And in thys broil he had good occaſion offered hym to repaire to the hermitage for a ſeaſon. Thither the Lorde Thibaut Gerolzege a Baron inuited hym, a man as wel affectioned to learnyng and learned men, as to true religiō, who was the adminiſtrator of our Ladies Hermitage. The cauſe that moued Zuinglius to repayre thither, was the ſingular deſire he had to publiſh Chriſt and the verity, among diuers & farre diſtant nacions, who for the famous brute of y• place, in frequency flowed thither, and partly the goodly oportunity he ſuppoſed to finde ther to come to a more perfect vnderſtāding of the Greke tong.

He aunſwered he was content, and truſted, that if the grace of god was preacher & receyued in ſo famous a place, the other Cantōs or quarters of Suiderland would followe that example, and by thys meane a godlye reformation would enſue.
                  And all be it hee was aſſured hee ſhoulde not haue lyke ſalarye as before, yet he ſayde, yf they woulde appoynt hym that function, he woulde endeuour to dyſcharge the ſame. But he woulde not requyre it at the tyme of eſertion, as many are accuſtomed, to procure the voyce and ſuffrage of other. I was ſuborned, I truly Agathye, to geue Zuinglius my voyce, whych I gaue, aud receyued graunt for hym. Who was immediatly ſent

for, & admitted wyth y• incredible ioy of al good perſōs. A while after being in the Chapiter of the Chanons, he proponed vnto them, what he determined to teach the people, to wit, the hiſtory of our Sauiour Chriſt, accordyng to S. Mathew, ſo as his vertue, whoſe name thei did aduaunce ſhould not be buryed any lenger, to the detrimēt of diuine glory, & helth of ſoules. Further, he proteſted he wold not expound the ſame by humayn ſence, bindyng himſelfe by othe to any priuate Interpreter, but by conference & induſtrious collection of ſcripture, & by the intelligence of the holy ghoſt, the whych he hoped to obtaine wt humble prayer made vnto God. This his reſolution made ſome heauy & ſorowful, & ſome ioyful, euen as the voyces before wer not al alike to admit Zuing lius. He began to execute his promis at the Natiuity of our Lord. 1519. and ſynce purſued the ſame. Duryng hysMartine Luther. continue in this, Luthers name begā to grow in credit, & many bought and red his bokes. And albeit Zuinglius as then red thē not, yet he exhorted in his ſermōs his auditors to bie & reade thē.

The reaſon that moued Zuinglius to do thys, was becauſe yt people, reading them & vnderſtanding, Zuinglius emploied no time in ſtudi of them, myght conſider in both a conformity and a grement of teachyng & opinion drawen out of the holye ſcriptures, & be the more enflamed to ground vpon and addict them ſelues to the truthe. Thys godly deuiſe had profitable ſucceſſe a whyle after. Truth it is, the order he obſerued in preaching made much alſo, wherby the ſymple as wel as the learned and ingenious might profit. For he explaned the ſcripture ſo plainlye, and with ſuch dexteritye, that he was lothe any ſhoulde depart from hys ſermons, vnles they were edefied & enriched wyth godlye lore. And as he manifeſtly taught y• truth, and that with great diligence, ſo was he vehement, & ſharpe in reprouyng vice, as much as euer was any man. Aboue al the reſt, he inueyed agaynſt the Penſionaries, the oppreſſors of the poore, & the diſſolute, ydle, & delicious lyuers. He vſed ſuch a maieſty in rebukyng, as neuer none the lyke before, when he thundred wt terrible

wordes agaynſt the Penſions & diſſolute lyuing, becauſe he woulde not ſeeme to daſhe and aſtonyſhe the Eſtates, or ſuche of the Commonty, as thronged among the peruers, & reprobate in hearyng his ſermons, he euer more added thys: That thys my vehement rebuke may not agreue & trouble thee, O vertuous man, vnderſtād I touch thee not, nor in thys matter I haue to do with thee. Sometime he digreſſed from hys theame, when matters interceadyng enforced hym too ſurceaſe hys begunne purpoſe. But now the bleſſed & happy tyme expired, the ſoūdeſt and beſt part of the people embraced truth, he diſcourſed in hys ſermons againſt thynges leſſe tollerable in the Church, he condempned the priuate gaynes of Prieſtes, & ſuche as by priuate power abuſed the church, whych moued the prieſtes and laity to omit no time of conſultacion, by what wyle, or policies they myght entrap hym. But of thys perhaps I wyl diſcourſe more at large. Now let vs returne to hys ſtudies: Emong ſoZuingliꝰ Lectures. many laborius affaires, he ceaſed not to read al approued Greeke authors,

                  From earlye morning, tyl tenne of the clocke, he applyed hym ſelfe to reade, interpretate, inſtruct, & write, as tyme and occaſion required. After Dinner he attended to ſuch as would conferre wyth hym in any matter, or required counſell, or he deuiſed and walked wyth hys friendes tyll twoo of the clocks, at whych tyme he returned to hys ſtudye.

                  The cauſe y• moued me to publiſhe this letter here, is to teſtify y• if Zuinglius had bene more ambicious, then he was ſincere & godli, he might haue had preeminēt eſtate, & abundance of welth.

For not onelye the Pope wrate vnto hym, but alſo to Fraunces Zuiggien to practiſe wyth Zuinglius, to leane to the Apoſtolical ſea, & mayntayne that part. At a certaine tyme I prayed Fraunces to tell me what the Pope promiſed for the ſame. He aunſwered: certaynly al ſaue hys Papiſtical chayre, or Apoſtolicall ſea. Euen now the Goſpel began to floryſh, and was eſtemed of the greateſt part, for a heauenly trouth, namely of the Senate of Zurick, and of the Councell of the. 2. hūdred, wherfore Zuinglius began to ſtudy to reduce thynges to a better ſtate & to procede orderli. Thei altered fyrſt thoſe things whych empeſched the propagacion & aduauncement of the Goſpell. The nombre of Prieſtes and Moonkes were growen in tract of tyme to a more huge multitude, then neede required, for matter of religion. It was then ordayned by the Senate, throughe the perſwaſion of Zuinglius: that the nombre ſhuld be abridged & reduced to fewe, & thoſe neceſſary for the ſeruice of y• Church, prouided that none ſhoulde be depriued or expelled theyr benefice, but enioy

the reuenue of the ſame, duryng theyr lyfe, & deceaſed, none to be ſubſtitute in theyr place. The three ordersThe Monkes ſee at lyberty. of Monkes were ſpoyled of theyr religious attyre, and put al together in a place, whence they myghte go forth as oft, and when they thought good wythout any contradiction, eyther to marry or to apply theyr ſtudy. If any would not ſauour y• ſwetenes of the Goſpel, they had lybertye to go and do where & what they would, in ſuch ſort, as none had hys conſcience charged. The eccleſiaſtical reuenues were employed vpon the miniſters of the Church, y• profeſſors of good learning, the reſt of the prieſts & Monkes and on the poore. There were found amōg theſe yong men of great expectacion, and purely affectioned to the ſtudy of piety. Such were reſerued in hope to ſerue the church, & were nouriſhed through out the whole ſignory of Zuricke, and after were employed as neede required. Zuinglius alſo a zelous man towardes ſacred & good learnyng had builded the foundacion of a ſchoole, whyche had not bene infer our to any, yf death had not diſſolued

by fatal ſtroke his godly purpoſe. Further, he deputed certaine of the Counſell to vnderſtand and examine the ſtate of Matrimonye. He perſwaded to abolyſhe the Images, whyche were then worſhipped, to deface and teare in peeces the Maſſe, & to ſet vp y• Supper of our lord in his integrity

Iohn. This peſtiferous ſect was of this nature, the more we trauailed to repreſſe their inſolencye, the more they encreaſed in theyr furor and raging heate. Wherefore the Senate was enforced to proceede againſt them by way of impriſonment exile, and death, as not agaynſt Anabaptiſtes, but periured, rebel, & ſedicious parſons, for y• they eſtemed vanitye, more then veritye, preferred vyce aboue vertue, & embracing ſediciō, hated ſecurity. And it was neceſſary to ſence & fortefy y• godly wt bokes, leaſt they might be ſeduced. The laſt that was found of this ſect was Baldaſar Hubmer enſeigne bearer of the Anabaptiſtes, who of a friend & felow of y• Goſpel was becom a miſcheuous foe.

Thys fyrſt wyth writing bewrayed hys wickednes, after in the preſence of the deputed Counſellours approned the ſame. For being eſcaped from Walſhut, a Towne ſituate by the Rhene, he came to render hym ſelf to the Lordes of Zuricke, wher he was apprehended. He required the Lordes of the Counſayle he myghte conferre with Leo Iuda, Sebaſtiā Economus and me. The whych was graunted vnto him for the ſecond time. We traualied ſo much with hym, that vndoutedly he promiſed to ſubmyt him ſelfe the morrow after. Cōming then from the Senate houſe to the Temple, he aſcended the Pulpit, after Zuinglius was gone downe, & confirmed all that he had taught before, ſaying he was moued therto, becauſe Zuinglius had prayſed ſo muche that vertue Conſtancy, intitulyng and callyng ſo hys partinacious opinion. He was then brought backe to pryſon, where he was deteyned, tyll Zuinglius ſecretly releaſed hym, and ſent hym away, not wythout money & a guyde. And arriuing at Conſtance, he ſo detracted and moſt impudētly defamed

For Eccius had enterpriſed in two Epiſtles directed to the Embaſſadours of the league, to conuince and confute the errours and hereſy of Zuinglius, by the reading of theſe letters, & for that Eccius made none account of y• that was wrytten to him, you may vnderſtand the Lordes intencion, why they ſtayed Zuinglius, although he hymſelfe

aunſwered ſufficiently that matter▪ in hys woorkes agaynſt Faber, & would to God I had euen nowe that diſputacion to ſend to you. Al be it he was not preſent in the diſputacion: yet he labored as much with care, diligence, counſel, aduertiſement, exhortacion and writing, whych he ſent to Bade, as though he had aided againſt the enemies of y• truth. For my part I deſyre nothyng more, then to haue ſene hym face to face diſputyng wyth Eccius at ful liberty: I beleue the .v. lytle Cantons of Suicerland had giuen perfect iudgement, where the lye or trouth had reſted, but it was not lawful for hym to be ther. Since that tyme, findyng ſecurity in trauayl, he went to Berne wher was Murnerus & Eccius, wyth. 4. Byſhops, and certayn principall Moonkes, whych the counſel of Berne required vnder ſurety to repayre thyther. Trouth it is, he was garded with. 200. men of armes to paſſe by the confederate Coūtries. He made alſo a long iourney to Marpurge, to conferre wyth Martine Luther, and Phillyp Melancthon, of the Euchariſtical Sacrament, not doubtyng

ani thing, becauſe it was a place voyde of daunger. You cannot chuſe but euidently perceyue, he hath endured great trauayles in theſe affaires. Diuers called hym teacher of new opinions, becauſe of hys iudgement of the ſupper of our Lord. But I beleue if they had red with equitye, and well weyed that y• he wrote to the Princes of Germany, aſſembled at Auſburg, they woulde haue iudged other wyſe. I remyt you to the booke, fearing is loſe tyme. For what perſwaſion wyl auayle hym, that in the ſame treatiſe of the Supper of our Lorde, wyll not perceyue and learne the truth? Hytherto we haue treated of the paynes and trauayles he ſuſtayned to defend the verity, and nowe we wyll declare the peryiles he incurred for the ſame.

Thys incontinently moued certayne furious Papiſtes to fall to weapons, and broche inteſtine warre. Wherupon Zuinglius wrate to hys friendes in thys maner.
                  I wil repeate vnto you that I haue often wrytten, that is, that ye be conſtant, and not dyſmayd with the war, for ye peace that ſome ſollicite ſo carefully, is a warre and no peace, & the warre that we enterpriſe, is peace & not warre. For we couet not ye bloud of any lyuing creature, & abhorre the effuſion of the ſame in thys commocion: but our whole entent is to interrupte the licencious gouernment of ſome. If thys he not taken in hande, the Goſpell ſhall neuer haue his free courſe, nor the Miniſters of the ſame lyue in ſecurity. Our determinacion tendeth to no cruelty, but all that we deliberate, is friendly and paternal.

We deſyre to preſerue ſuche as by ignorancy procure theyr perdicion. We be reſolued to defende liberty, wherefore diſdayne not our enterpriſes, for certaynly they be more godly and iuſt then is reported vnto you. Credit▪ vs, and be not ſeduced by ſuche as accuſe vs. Ye haue tryed our conſtancye and faythfulnes, and well perceyued our enemies leuity, and diſſimulaciō. Be preſent wyth our company, & obſerue conſtantly the fayth ye owe to God & men. What ſhal I ſay further? dread nothyng, we wyl atchieue al thynges ſo proſperouſly (God helping vs) as ye ſhall not be a ſhamed, nor repent ye haue combyned your ſelues wyth vs.
                  Theſe were Zuinglius woordes, whych I haue recited here to declare how iniuſtlye he is nominated of certayne a Bloudſucker. It is moſt true he was magnanimous and cōſtant in greateſt daungers, but alwayes cyrcumſpect, prouident and wiſe. He neuer thurſted the bloud of anye, no

of hys Countrye, the vertue of the Aunceltors, & the glory of Chriſt, what ſo euer his enemies ceblaterate the which I proteſt in trouth before God. He was twyſe in the warres of the confederates, which bare y• name of a Monaſterye called the Chappell. He wyllinglye went to the firſte, becauſe he would be preſent at the conſultacion, fearyng any thyng ſhoulde be decree
                        •
                      ther contrary to right and equity. The matter was ended well, and without effuſion of broud. I haue heard him ſay he perceiued more malice, and peruers counſel ther, then euer before he red in vokes, or had learned by experience. In the ſecond war he was elected Paſtor of the armye, where he went vnwyllyngly, foreſeing the peryl that was iminent. The condicion of the warre myſliked hym marueilouſly, and the rather for that he ſawe the enemyes victailes cut of, vnderſtanding well what myſchiefe hunger would brede & compel. Albeit to ſpeake truly, after thoſe of Zurick had enterpryſed the ſame (wherunto certayne whom we knowe prycked them of a good zeale, hopynge in the

meane ſeaſon there would be a conſultacion and treaty of peace made, notwithſtanding the Lordes of Zuricke had choſe the warce) Zuinglius was not determined to alter anye thyng, doubting the enemyes woulde make no accompt of them, as he paſſed not much to wythſtand theyr inuaſion.
                  Fourtene dayes before the armye was encamped, I hearde hym twyſe ſay in pulpit wher he preached, in the midſt of this broil: I know wel what thys meaneth, all thys is to procureiny death. He declared ſecretly to certayne of his friendes, that the blaſing ſtarre which appeared many wekes, and whiche we ſuppoſed to portende Ecolampadius deceaſe: ſignified hys fatal fall. The Soldiours of Zuricke ruſhed forth in great diſorder. I cannot but ſorowfully lament, when I cal to mynde that doleful tyme. They marched not lyke men of warre in euen rankes, but lyke a ſorte of venturours, ſome ſtraglyng abroade, ſome runnyng before and behynde the Enſeygne, deſtitute of conduct counſell, and pollecye, and accorded not one wyth an other.
                  
                     I cannot name them to be any great nomber of me of armes, for wher thei wer muſtred. 5000. they appeared not in the field ful. 4000. Then as thys lyttle nomber approched to encountre a huge army and in perfect order, Zuinglius folowed mounted on horſ backe, accordyng to the maner of the Country. I cannot expreſſe the dolor and ſorrowe I ſuſteyned, when I beheld him, truly I was aſtoniſhed ther with. We mourned all that day, and made our humble prayer vnto God. But he hadde decreed an other thyng for vs, and not agaynſt vs, as I holily expounded the ſame. For by thys we haue learned to be more circumſpect, and to take better hede, reuerencyng more the Goſpel, and fearyng God alſo. And the enemyes that reſiſted the Goſpel, are now diſcloſed, and manifeſted to vs. About the euenyng of the day, we were aduertiſed that the battayles had ioyned very hotely, & that we had loſt Zuinglius. The brute went he was thriſe diſmounted, with the checke of the Troupe, but incontinētly he was holpen vp on horſeback
                        •
                      agayn, and the fourth tyme he was

ſtryken on the chynne with a terryble blowe, and fallyng downe from hys horſe vpon hys knees, he ſayd: what euyl hap is thys? they may flea the body, but not the ſoule, and thys ſpoken he departed in our Lord.
                  After thys ouerthrow, the enemies hauyug good leyſure (for our Soldiours were retired into place of ſafegarde) ſought for the body of Zuinglius. But who teld them he was in yt battayle and ſlayne? The body beyng founde, was condempned, and after ſentence geuen, diſmembred & burnt to aſhes. Behold y• diſcourſe of Zuinglius lyfe, lo the accident of his death which he ſuffered for the ſingular affection he bare to hys Countrye, and Chriſtian common weale. Truth it is, thys end is horryble in the ſyght of mortall men, but precious before God, and is predeſtinate to al faithful Miniſters by diuine iuſtice, if y• Lord of hys grace and ſyngular bountye, ſpare them not.
