               WHen that the Cocke began to crow
               in February laſt
               It was nere dai I knewe right wel
               the byrdes they ſonge ſo faſt
            
            
               For they recorded pleſauntly
               when they did vnderſtande
               That winters blaſtes began to ſwage
               and Vere was euen at hande
            
            
               And when the Parker hard this Cock
               eftſone he gan to ſtere
               And vp he ſtart and gate him forth
               to viewe and ſe the dere,
            
            
               And when he came he ſe the dere
               where they were on the launde
               At whome the dere were not amaſde
               but ſtyll they ſtode and faunde.
            
            
               For well they wyſt this Parker came
               to do his wonted feate,
               And or he went from them agayne
               in dede he gaue them meate.
            
            
               Which they had ſought & could not find
               wherefore they loked thyn,
               As though they had ben chaſt with dogs
               that lately had ruſht in.
            
            
               As ſone as he was gon from them
               a Scory ſcourde the coſte,
               To fray the bandogges from the Dere
               for feare they ſhould be loſte.
            
            
               Whiche longe had made ſuch ſpoile of them
               as like hath not ben ſene,
               At euery courſe a leyſhe or two
               as we full ofte haue ſene.
            
            
               This Scory ſcoured all the parke
               he ſercht it rounde about.
               To fortifie the walles therof
               to kepe the bandogs out
            
            
               When he had take the viewe therof,
               and ſawe the parke ſo ſcalde.
               He made his ſute vnto the Quene
               to haue it all newe palde.
            
            
               And after him there dyd ſuccede
               a man of auncient yeares.
               Which did renewe the former ſute
               vnto the noble Peeres.
            
            
               Whoſe iudgement is profounde & depe
               as all the learned ſay.
               And he affyrmde and proued it both
               our fayth was in decaye.
               Whiche is the mooſt aſſured wall
               that may or can be bylte,
               Whiche wall hath ben battred at
               that it was almoſte ſpylte,
               And if this wall be not repayrde
               but fall ſtyll in decaye
               The bandogs wyll breake in againe
               and driue the deare awaye.
               Thus hath this aunciēt whithed proued
               with argumentes mooſt ſtronge,
               That if this wall be not repayrde
               the parke cannot ſtande longe.
            
            
               Wherfore the buylders of this wall
               that haue take it in hande
               Haue ſharpned all theyr tooles right wel
               to haue this buildinge ſtande.
            
            
               A Byll alſo ſharped his edge
               to cut the brambles downe
               And to deſtroy the wicked wedes
               that were in hye renoume.
               Thus all theſe builders work righe well
               for they haue begon the frame,
               And all that ſe theyr workmanſhip
               do much commend the ſame.
            
            
               They worke it artificiallye
               as men experte and wyſe.
               For why they builde vpon the rocke
               and not vpon the yſe.
            
            
               Who hath not ſene, who hath not hard
               the doynges of theſe men,
               What paynes they take inceſſantlye
               to buylde this wall agen,
            
            
               To kepe the yonge fawnes frō the fox
               and from the wolues and dogges.
               Leſte that the parke be ſoylde agayne
               with ſwyne and fylthy hogges.
               Marke well ye griſt that grind all groūd
               and ye ſhal vnderſtande,
               That he is able well to buyld
               the thinge he taketh in hande.
            
            
               For he hath newly bete his quernes,
               wherfore it may be thought,
               That he intendes to grinde the griſt
               that we full longe haue ſought,
            
            
               But when the mighty Sampſon cam
               that longe had ben away.
               He muſled vp the bandogges mouthes
               that the had naught to ſaye.
            
            
               So that theyr fury is well cooled
               through Sampſons force and might
               For though they grin and loke awrye
               they haue no power to byte,
            
            
               For nowe the dere go quietlye
               within the pale and parke,
               And are nothinge afrayde to here
               the bandogs how they barke,
            
            
               There kepers nowe ar come agen
               that longe haue ben awaye,
               Wherfore the poore and ſimple Dere,
               are ioyfull of this daye,
            
            
               For when the Horne was heard of thē
               
               which ſounded like a bell,
               The Dere that knewe the ſame before
               dyd like it wery well.
            
            
               He blew his meaſures in ſuch ſort
               ſo truly and ſo trymme
               That all that hard the ſound therof
               had much delight in him,
            
            
               Beſides all theſe yet are there mo,
               whoſe diligence and payne,
               Do craue of vs etarnall prayſe
               that lyue and do remayne,
               Leuer and Sandes, for ſo they hyght
               whoſe godly hartes and wyll
               Are wholy bent vnto the truth
               and to confute the yll,
            
            
               So are theſe two that yet remayne,
               as it hath well bene ſene,
               How learnedly they ſpeake their mindes
               before our noble Quene.
            
            
               Pedder and Wyntrel, theſe are they
               whoſe memory and fame
               Shalbe reuiued, when they are dead
               their actes deſerue the ſame,
            
            
               For theſe and for the reſt of them
               let vs geue thankes to God,
               whoſe mercy towardes vs is ſuche,
               that he hath broke the rod,
            
            
               O Lorde be holde thy labourers
               and now put to thy hande,
               To buylde thy holy Temple vp
               that it may euer ſtande.
            
            
               Dryue out the ydle men therof
               ye dryue them cleane awaye
               Whiche long haue ſought the ſpoile of it
               to bringe it to decaye.
            
            
               To whome let vs left vp our hartes
               at morow and at euen,
               That it wyll pleaſe him to preſerue
               Eliſabeth our quene,
            
            
               Long to endure amongeſt vs here
               and to poſſeſſe her place,
               And afterwardes to Ioye with him
               when ſhe hath runne her race.
            
            Finis
