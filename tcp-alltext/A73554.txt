               ON yonder hill there ſprings a flower
               faire befall thoſe dainty ſwéetes:
               And by that flower there ſtands a bower,
               Where all the heauenly Muſes méets.
               And in that Bower there ſtands a chaire,
               fringed all about with golde,
               And therein ſits the faireſt face,
               that euer did mine eyes behold.
            
            
               It was Philida faire and bright,

               She whom Venus did moſt ſpight,
               and the blinded little boy.
               It was ſhe the wiſest rich,
               whom all the World did ioy to ſee,
               It was Ipſe qui the which,
               there was none but only ſhee.
            
            
               Thou art the ſhepheards Quéene,
               pitty me thy wofull Swaine,
               For by thy vertue hath been ſéen
               dead men reſtorde to life againe.
               Looke on me with thy faire eyes,
               one ſmiling looke and I am gon:
               Looke on me for I am he,
               thy poore afflicted Coridon.
               
            
            
               Dead am I to all delights,
               except thy mercy quicken mee:
               Graunt oh Quéene of elſe I die,
               a Pſalme for this my melody.

            A pleaſant new Ballad of DAPHNE.
            To a new Tune.
            
               WHen Daphne from fair Phebu did flie,
               the Weſt wind moſt ſweetly
               Did blow in her face:
               Her ſilken ſcarfe ſcarſe ſhadowed her eyes,
               The gods cride O pitty, & held her in chaſe:
               Stay Nymph, ſtay Nymph cries Apollo,
               
               Larry and turne thee, ſweet Nymph ſtay,
               Lyon nor Lyger do 
                     〈◊〉
                   thée follow.
               turne thy faire eyes and looke this way,
               O turne, O pretty ſwéet,
               And let our red lips meet:
               Pitty O Daphne, pitty O pitty me,
               pitty O Daphne pitty me.
            
            
               She gaue no eare vnto his crie,
               But ſtill did neglect him the more he did mone
               He ſtill did entreate, ſhe ſtill did deny:
               And earneſtly praies him to leaue her alone,
               Neuer, neuer cries Apollo,
               
               Unleſſe to loue thou doe conſent,
               But ſtill with my voyce ſo hollow,
               I'le crie to thee while life be ſpent,
               But if thou turne to me,
               I will praiſe thy felicity,
               Pitty O Daphne, pitty, O pitty me,
               pitty O Daphne pitty me.
            
            
               Away like Venus Downe ſhe flies,
               The red bloud her buskins did run all adown
               Her plaintife Loue ſhe now denies,
               Crying, helpe, helpe Diana, & ſaue my renown
               Wanton, wanton luſt is neare me,
               Would and chaſt Diana heare,
               Let the earth a virgin beare me,
               or deuoure me quicke a maid.
               Summer pure heard her pray,
               Pitty O Daphe, pitty O pitty me,
               pitty O Daphne pitty me.
            
            
               Amazed ſtood Apollo then,
               When he beheld Daphne turnd as ſhe deſired
               Accurſed am I aboue Gods and men,
               With griefe & laments my ſences are tired,
               Farewell falſe Daphne moſt vnkind,
               My loue is buried in this graue,
               Long haue I ſought loue, yet loue could not finde,
               Therefore this is my Epithite,
               This trée doth Daphne couer,
               That neuer pittied Louer,
               Farewell faiſe Daphne that would not pitty
               nor be my Loue, yet art thou my frée. me,
