               SIR, the kind welcome that you alwaies daigne

                  Ʋnworthy obiect for iudicious eyes:
               Which but for you, eternally had ſlept,
               And, but to you, from henceforth euer dies:
               But lacke of better, forſt me for a ſhift,
               To bring you now this old new New-yeeres gift.

            The Wood-mans Bear.
            
               1.
               SEuenty nine skore yeeres and ſeuen
               Were expired from the birth
               Of a Babe, be got by Heauen,
               To bring peace vnto the Earth,
               Peace that paſſeth all eſteeming,
               Sinne-bound ſoules from Hell redeeming.
            
            
               Ver. 2.
               Phaebus in his yeerely race
               (Hauing paſt the Ram and Steere)
               Now began to poſt apace,
               Through the Twinnes faire houſes cleere,
               Prancking in perfumed robes,
               All theſe goodly nether Globes.
            
            
               Aurora. 3.
               And Aurora richly dight
               In an azure mantle faire,
               Freng'd about with ſiluer bright,
               Pearle-deaws dropping through the aire,
               Hung the gate with golden tiſſues,
               Where Hiperions Chariot iſſues.
            
            
               
               4.
               At which ſight (that all reioyoes)
               All the cunning Foreſt Quyer,
               Tuning loud their little voyces,
               Warbled who ſhould warble higher:
               Striuing all to beare the Bell
               (All in vaine) from Phylomel.
               
            
            
               5.
               When my ioyleſſe ſences dulled
               With the buſie toyle of Cities,
               Me from penſiue fancies pulled,
               To goe heare their heauenly ditties:
               To goe heare, and ſee, and ſent,
               Sounds, ſights, ſauours excellent.
            
            
               6.
               Wending then through Lawns and Thickets,
               Where the fearefull Deere do brouze,
               Where the wanton Fawnes and Prickets,
               Crop the top of ſpringing boughes:
               Where the Stag, and light-foot Hinde
               Skud, and skip, and turne, and winde.
            
            
               
               7.
               While I led my wandring feet,
               Through a ſilent ſhady Groue,
               Paued thicke with Primroſe ſweete,
               As mine eyes about did roue,
               Neere a ſpring I chanſt to ſpie,
               Where a wretched man did lie.
            
            
               8.
               Like a Wood-man was his weede,
               Groueling on the graſſe he lay,
               Mourning ſo as doth exceed
               All that euer I can ſay:
               Beaſts to bellow, birds to ſing,
               Ceaſt, to ſee ſo ſtrange a thing
                     •
                  
               
            
            
               9.
               Wringing hands, and weeping eyes,
               Heauy ſighes, and hollow grones,
               Wailing words, and wofull cries
               Were the witneſſe of his moanes:
               Moanes, that might with bitter paſſion,
               Mooue a flintie hearts compaſſion.
            
            
               
               10.
               Faine would I the cauſe haue kend,
               That could cauſe him ſo complaine:
               But I feard him to offend
               With repeating of his paine;
               Therefore I expected rather
               From himſelfe the ſame to gather.
            
            
               11.
               Sitting then in ſhelter ſhadie,
               To obſerue and marke his mone,
               Suddenly I ſaw a Ladie
               
               Haſting to him all alone,
               Clad in Maiden-white and greene:
               Whom I iudg'd the Forreſt Queene.
            
            
               12.
               Who the eager game purſuing,
               Loſt her Ladies in the chaſe,
               Till ſhe heard the wretches ruing,
               Vnto whom ſhe hied apaſe;
               Moouing him with mild intreat.
               To vnſold his griefe ſo great.
            
            
               
               13.
               When the Queene of Continence,
               With the muſicke of her words,
               Had by ſacred influence
               Charm'd the edge of ſorrows ſwords:
               Swords that deeper wound haue made,
               Then the keene Toledo blade.
            
            
               14.
               Faine he would, and yet he fainted
               To vnfold his fatall griefe:
               Paſſions in his face depainted,
               Striuing whether ſhould be chiefe:
               Thus at laſt, though loth and ſorry,
               Sigh'd he out his mournfull ſtory.
            
            
               15.
               Madam (quoth he) (yet he knew not
               What ſhe was), that you may ſee,
               That I curſed cauſeleſſe rue not,
               Lend a while your care to me,
               And you ſhall perceiue the ſource,
               Whence my cares haue had their courſe.
            
            
               
               16.
               Whence my cares and ſad incumbers
               Haue ariſen and proceeded:
               Whoſe account of countleſſe numbers
               Hath the Oceans ſand exceeded;
               Whoſe extreme tormenting ſmart,
               Paſſeth all conceit of heart.
            
            
               17.
               Thrice-ſeuen ſummers I had ſeene
               Deckt in Floraes rich aray;
               And as many winters keene,
               Wrapt in ſutes of ſiluer gray:
               Yet the Cirian Queenes blind Boy
               Crudged at my grieſeleſſe ioy.
            
            
               18.
               But when on my maiden chin
               Mother Nature gan ingender
               Smooth, ſoft, golden doune, and thin
               Blades of beuer, ſilke-like ſlender,
               Then he finding fuell ſit,
               Sought for coales to kindle it.
            
            
               
               19.
               Coales he found, but found no fier,
               For th'Eaſt Friſian icie skie
               Made the ſparkes of loues deſier
               Sudden borne, as ſoone to die:
               Thus ſo long as there I bid
               All was vaine that Venus did▪
               
            
            
               20.
               Seeing then that nought might boot,
               Shee (conſulting with her baſtard)
               Bid the buſie wanton ſhoot:
               But alas he durſt not daſtard,
               In that quarter well he wiſt
               Armes to meet with, me he miſt.
            
            
               21.
               Therefore wearie of his toile,
               Hopeleſſe ſtill of better hap,
               In that ſo vnhappie ſoile,
               Where few Brutes he could entrap:
               He forſooke the frozen Ems,
               
               Soaring towards ſiluer Thames.
               
            
            
               
               22.
               On whoſe lillie-paued bancks,
               Where ſaire water nymphes reſorted
               Plai'd he many wanton pranks,
               While the ſilly damzels ſported,
               Wounding with his cruell darts,
               Their vnwarie tender hearts.
            
            
               23.
               Chiefly in my Mother-Towne,
               Where the Paragon of honor,
               Vertues praiſe, and beauties crowne,
               With ſweet Ladies tending on her,
               Kept her Court in Palla
                     •
                  e royall,
               Guarded by attendants loyall.
            
            
               24.
               There the Paphian Prince (perceiuing
               Lords and Ladies, young and old,
               Apt (through eaſe) for Loues deceiuing),
               Sends about hi
                     •
                   ſhafts of gold,
               Striking all ſaue her he dares not,
               
                  Dians ſelfe, the reſt he ſpares not.
            
            
               
               25.
               Hauing triumpht there a ſeaſon
               Ouer all degrees and ſexes,
               Planting loue, ſupplanting reaſon,
               Where his darts dire venome vexes:
               Suddenly he croſt the ſtood,
               To the famous Seat of Lud.
               
            
            
               26.
               Finding there ſufficient fuell,
               To maintaine his wanton fiers,
               By and by begins he cruell,
               To inflame both Sonnes and Siers,
               Maid and Miſtris, Man and Maſter,
               Dam and Daughter, light or chaſter.
            
            
               27.
               Thus he tortures, voide of pitie,
               Rich and poore, and fond and wiſe,
               Through the ſtreetes of all the Citie:
               Cauſing by his cruelties,
               Sighing-ſinging, freezing-frying,
               Laughing-weeping, liuing-dying.
            
            
               
               28.
               Fates by this time had contriued
               Cauſes that me thither drew,
               Which ere euer I arriued,
               This deteſted Tyrant knew:
               Wyling waiting time and place,
               To reuenge his old diſgrace.
            
            
               29.
               Oftentimes he did attempt
               Euen in ſtreetes of ſecond Troy,
               
               To haue puniſht my contempt,
               By bereauing freedoms ioy;
               But vnable there tomatch me,
               Elſe-where yet he thought to catch-me.
            
            
               30.
               I was wont (for my diſport)
               Often in the Summer ſeaſon,
               To a Village to reſ

                  th a Plumb-tree ſhade,
               Many pleaſant walks I made.
            
            
               
               31.
               Till a graſſe-borne-kricket mounted,
               On that goodly Trees faire top,
               Made his fore-fruit (rare accounted)
               Ouer-ſoone to fall and drop:
               Loading euery branch and bow
               With her brood of krickets now.
            
            
               32.
               Hether while I vs'd to haunt,
               
                  Cupid ſeeking change gf harbor,
               Leauing ſtately Troy-nouant,
               
               Lighted vnder this freſh Arbor,
               Neere the hower when Titan wounds vs,
               Hides our ſhaddowes wholly vnder-vs.
            
            
               33.
               When the Dwarfting did perceiue me,
               Me Loues moſt rebellious skorner,
               By ſome cautel to deceiue me,
               Skipt he ſoone into a corner:
               Where left I ſhould ſpie the Elfe,
               In a Bear he hid himſelfe.
            
            
               
               34.
               Many Beaſts, and Birds beſide,
               Adorned with the pride of nature;
               Faire of fether, rich of hide,
               Trim of forme, and tall of ſtature,
               Vs'd this Orchard to frequent,
               Till the Summers heat was ſpent.
            
            
               35.
               But the Bear was my betrayer;
               Nay, ſhe was my liues defender:
               But ſhe was my freedomes ſlayer;
               Nav, ſhe was my thraldomes ender:
               But ſhe fild my ſoule with ſadneſſe;
               Nay, ſhe turn'd my griefe to gladneſſe.
            
            
               36.
               Bleſſed Bear that beares the bell
               From the faireſt of her kind:
               Such a Bear as doth excell
               Thoſe to either Pole aſſignd:
               Such a Bear, as 'twold not grieue me,
               To be Bearward made, beleeue me.
            
            
               
               37.
               In a Crof
                        •

               (Making mends for Daphnes wrong)
               Made out of the ground to ſpring
               Trees transform'd to Daphnes young:
               In the Crofte ſo faire and pleaſant,
               Harbor of the Prince-diſh Pheaſant.
            
            
               38.
               Southward was this white Bear bred,
               Yet not skorcht with Affrick heate:
               For her Dam had dipt her head
               In the Chriſtall waters neat
               Of a Spring cald Hambarwell,
               
               Which can Sun-burnt ſpots expell:
            
            
               39.
               And beſides, while young ſhe was,
               She was carried from that coaſt,
               To be taught ſuch practiſe, as
               Makes ſuch beaſts beloued moſt.
               Beaſt am I to call her beaſt:
               Yet indeed a Bear's a beaſt.
            
            
               
               40.
               
                  Bear in name, but not in nature,
               Was this much admired creature,
               Per
                     •
                  erleſſe piece of perfect ſtature,
               Full of all deſired feature:
               Feature ſuch, as all too ſaint,
               My dull pen preſumes to paint.
            
            
               41.
               Louely Lilly-white ſhe was,
               Straight proportion'd, ſtately-paced,
               Coy, or kind (as came to paſſe)
               Curteous-ſpoken, comely graced:
               
                  Graces ſeem'd of graces lauiſh,
               Eyes that gaz'd on her to rauiſh.
            
            
               42.
               Locks like ſtreames of licquid Amber,
               Smooth downe dangling ſeem'd to ſpred,
               Hangings fit for Beauties chamber:
               Curtins fit for Beauties bed:
               Of which ſlender golden ſleaue,
               
                  Loue his wanton nets did weaue.
            
            
               
               43.
               Fore-head faire as ſummers face,
               Built vpon two Ebene Arkes▪
               
               Vnder which in equall ſpace
               Stood two bright reſplendant ſparks:
               Sparkes excelling in their ſhine,
               Faireſt beames of Ericyne.
               
            
            
               44.
               From thoſe Arkes, betweene theſe eyes,
               (Eyes that arme Loues Archers tillar)
               Euen deſcending did ariſe,
               Like a pale Piram

               45.
               On each ſide whereof extended
               Fields, wherein did euer grow
               Roſes, Lillies, Violets blended,
               Steept in ſtreames of ſanguine ſnow:
               Red-white hils, and white-red plaines
               Azure vales, and azure vaines.
            
            
               
               46.
               Vaines, whoſe ſaphir ſeas do ſlide
               (Branch-wiſe winding in and out)
               With a gentle flowing tide
               All that Little World about,
               Vp and downe, aloft and vnder,
               To fill all this world with wonder.
            
            
               47.
               With her mouth I meddle not,
               Nor with Ecchoes dainty mazes,
               Left theſe hearing any iot
               Miſ reported of her prayſes,
               That in forming it incenſe
               To reproue my proud offence.
            
            
               48.
               But fond he that ouerskips

               Thoſe ſmooth ſmiling louely lips,
               Which each other alwaies kiſt.
               Sweetly ſwelling round like cherries,
               Fragrant as our garden-berries.
            
            
               
               49.
               Lippes like leaues of Damask Roſe,
               Ioyned iuſt in equall meaſure,
               Which in their ſweete folds incloſe
               Plenteous ſtore of pretious treaſure:
               Treaſures more then may be told,
               Balme, and Pearles, and pureſt gold.
            
            
               50.
               Balme her breth, for ſo it ſmelt;
               Pearles, thoſe pales about the Parke,
               Where that golden Image dwelt,
               Her pure tongue that moſt I marke:
               Such a tongue, as with my tung
               Neuer can enough be ſung.
            
            
               51.

               Dimpled with a chearefull ſmile,
               Which the Cape of Loue I call.

                     den was this Iland (Madam)
               While I gaz'd, mine eye was Adam.
               
            
            
               
               52.
               Next he
                     •
                   Swan-like necke I ſaw,
               Then thoſe ſpotleſſe ſnowie mountaines,
               Which when Loues warme Sunne ſhall thaw,
               Shall reſolue in Nectar fountaines:
               Twixt which mountaines lies a valley,
               Like Joues heauenly milken alley.
            
            
               53.
               What my Song ſhould further ſay,
               Art enuying my delight,
               (As the night conceales the day)
               Shrowdes in ſhaddowes from my ſight
               Art that addes ſo much to others,
               Here a world of beauties ſmothers.
            
            
               54.
               Yet not ſo, but that I ſaw,
               As the Sunne ſhines through the rack,
               Smalling downe by meaſures law,
               Her ſtraight comely ſhapen backe:
               Which though well it liked mee,
               Leſt of all I long'd to ſee.
            
            
               
               55.
               But her ſlender virgin Waſte
               Made me beare her girdle ſpight,
               Which the ſame by day imbraſte,
               Though it were caſt off at night;
               That I wiſht, I dare not ſay,
               To be girdle night and day.
            
            
               56.
               Left thoſe hands that here I kiſſe,
               As offended therewithall,
               Riſe to chaſtiſe mine amiſſe,
               Though their rage be rare and ſmall;
               Yet God ſhield her praiſes ſinger,
               Should offend her little finger.
            
            
               57.
               Yet I ſeare in much I ſhall,
               For to ſay her hands are white,
               Slicke and ſlender, fingers ſmall,
               Straight and long; her knockles dight
               With curled Roſes, and her nailes
               With pearle-muſcles ſhining skailes.
            
            
               
               58.
               Theſe are praiſes great, I grant;
               But full often heard I before,
               Many may like honours vant,
               Such as theſe haue many more:
               Hers are ſuch, as ſuch are none,
               Saue that hers are ſuch alone?
            
            
               59.
               For, if ſhe had liued, when
               Proud Arachne was aliue,
               
                  Pallas had not needed then
               To come downe with her to ſtriue:
               Her faire fingers, finely faſt
               Had Arachnes cunning paſt.
            
            
               60.
               But when to the muſicke choice
               Of thoſe nimble ioynts ſhe marries
               Th' Eccho of her Angel-voice,
               Then the praiſe and prize ſhe carries
               Both from Orpheus and Amphion,
               
               Shaming Lynus and Arion.
               
            
            
               
               61.
               Here before her nimble feet
               Fall we flat (mine humble muſe)
               To endeauour (as is meet)
               All our errors to excuſe:
               For theſe are the beautious baſes
               That ſupport this frame of graces.
            
            
               62.
               Now, like as a Princely building,
               Rare for Modell, rich for matter,
               Beautified without with guilding,
               Fond beholders eyes to flatter,
               Inwardly containeth moſt
               Both of cunning and of coſt.
            
            
               63.
               So this frame, in framing which
               Nature her owne ſelfe excelled,
               Though the outward walles were rich,
               Yet within the ſame there dwelled
               Rareſt beauties, richeſt treaſures,
               Chiefe delights, and choiceſt pleaſures.
            
            
               
               64.
               For within this curious Pallace,
               Mongſt the Muſes and the Graces,
               
               
                  Phebe chaſte, and charming Pallas
               
               Kept their Courts in ſundry places,

               Here the Foſter waxing faint,
               Looked on the louely Dame,

               67.
               Happie (me vnhappy moſt)

               Had my life or light been loſt
               Ere my ſight that ſight had ſeene;
               Then had I not liu'd to languiſh
               In this eaſe-leſſe end-leſſe anguiſh.
            
            
               68.
               But becauſe you doubt (faire Dame)
               How from ſuch a heauen as this,
               Full of euery beauties flame,
               Full of bounty, full of bliſſe,
               Full of each delightfull ioy,
               Could deſcend the leaſt auoy.
            
            
               69.
               If you daigne attend Ile tell,
               (As my feeble tongue will let me)
               All misfortune that befell,
               Though the thought thereof doe fret me:
               Madam, ſo your kindnes moues me,
               That to ſhew you all behoues me:
            
            
               
               70.
               Therefore thinke vpon (I pray)
               What, when firſt my tale begun,
               Was foreſpoken to bewray
               Shifts of Cythereas ſonne,
               How, for feare I ſhould haue ſpide him
               In a Bear the Vrchin hid him.
            
            
               71.
               Thence from, crafty Cupid ſhot
               All the arrowes of his quiuer:
               But my heart that yeelded not,
               Made them all in ſunder ſhiuer:
               Till he full of ſhame and ſorrow,
               Better bow and ſhafts did borrow.
            
            
               72.
               Borrow did he of that Bear,
               
               Armes more apt to work my wo,
               Stringing with her golden haire
               Her faire browes, he made his bow:
               Whence for ſhafts he ſhot likewiſe,
               Beames of her keene-peircing cies.
            
            
               
               73.
               Of which Diamond-headed dartes,
               Beating hard my boſomes Center,
               Whence reſiſting power departs,
               Where but theſe, none elſe could enter:
               Some abiding, ſome rebounded,
               Wherewithall the Bear was wounded.
            
            
               74.
               Wounded was the gentle Bear,
               
               With the weapons that ſhe lent,
               That ſhe lent (alas) for feare,
               Leſt the Loue God ſhould her ſhent:
               So we ſee, who lend their armes,
               Oft procure their proper harmes.
            
            
               75.
               So did harmeleſſe ſhe (alas)
               That I euer muſt bemone,
               Mone I muſt, for nueer was
               Marble-hearted Mirmidon
               
               But would mone, and morne, and melt,
               To haue ſeene the paine ſhe felt.
            
            
               
               76.
               To haue ſeene her pitious plaining,
               To haue heard her loud lamenting,
               To haue thought on her complaining,
               To imagine her tormenting:
               Eyes would weep, and eares would wunder,
               Hardeſt hart would break in ſunder.
            
            
               77.
               So mine eyes▪ mine eares, and heart,
               Fild with waters, wonders, woes,
               Drowned, deafned, dead in part,
               Wel-nigh all their vertues loſe
               Euery ſence and all my reaſon
               Fled, and faild me for a ſeaſon.
            
            
               78.
               Here when this he had rehearſed,
               Ere the rufull reſt could follow;
               So the freſh remembrance pierced,
               That his voice waxt weake and hollow:
               Bitter teares abundant dropping,
               Drowned words their paſſage ſtopping.
            
            
               
               79.
               Words were turn'd to ſighes and ſobbing;
               Inward griefes did inlie grone:
               Hopeleſſe heart with heauie throbbing,
               Shew'd all ſignes of ſaddeſt mone.
               Signes made mone, but voice was mum,
               Small griefes ſpeake, but great are dumb▪
               
            
            
               80.
               Woe begun, and wondrous ſorry
               Was the Goddeſſe to behold him,
               Through repeating of his ſtorie
               In ſo ſad a fit to fold him:
               Fearing further to prouoke him,
               Left new ſeaes of ſorrow choke him.
            
            
               81.
               For as Sea-coales flame the faſter,
               When we caſt cold water on them:
               Or as Children vnder Maſter,
               Morne the more, the more we mone them:
               So the more ſhe ſpake, her ſpeeches
               More increaſt his cries and skreeches.
            
            
               
               82.
               Yet ſhe would not ſo forſake him,
               Left ſome ſauage hungry beaſt
               In this tragick trance ſhould take him,
               Of his fleſh to make a feaſt:
               Danger of which dire euent,
               Thus her pitie did preuent.
            
            
               83.
               Loud her bugle Horne ſhe blew,
               Babling Eccho voyce of vallies,
               Aierie Elſe, exempt from view,
               With the Foreſt muſick dallies:
               Doubling ſo the curled winde,
               That the firſt was hard to finde:
            
            
               84.
               Yet her nimble Nvmphs inured
               Often to the Fairies guile,
               Could not be ſo ſoone allured
               To enſu her ſubtle wile:
               For where firſt they heard the blaſt,
               Thither ward they trip it faſt.
            
            
               
               85.
               But becauſe theſe maids had follow'd
               Egerly their game together;
               They when firſt their Lady hollow'd,
               Could not by and by be with her:
               For before ſhe ſound the Foſter,
               All her traine (I told ye) loſt her.
            
            
               86.
               In came theſe bright beauties than,
               Where as they their Lady found
               Standing by this wretched man,
               That lay there vpon the ground:
               With which wofull ſight amazed,
               Each on him with wonder gazed.
            
            
               85.
               To whom their Goddeſſe did relate
               All before that he had told her,
               All his miſerable ſtate:
               Who did all the while behold her
               With a heauy halfe ſhut eye
               As a man at point to die.
            
            
               
               88.
               At which the Nymphes with pitie moued,
               Somewhat to aſſwage his woe
               For the Beares ſake whom he loued,
               And that him had loued ſo,
               Bad him of their helpe aſſure him,
               For they could the Art to cure him.
            
            
               89.
               For in a Groue thereby, there grew
               An hearbe which could loues power expell:
               Which (but they) none euer knew,
               As how it proſpered neere a well,
               Where Diana vſed to bathe her,
               When the ſcorching heate did ſcath her.
            
            
               90.
               Which the Siluans of thoſe Groues
               Held in very high account:
               For therewith they

                     s Fount,
               And that Hearb, the pride of Summer,
               Tooke that ſpeciall vertue from her.

               And the ſwifteſt of the traine,
               Away to fetch the ſame was ſent,
               Which her nimble ioynts did ſtraine,
               And return'd incontinent,
               And the ſimple with her brought,
               By which the cure was ſtrangely wrought.
            
            
               92.
               Which vnto the ſence applied
               As the iuyce thereof he taſted,

            O You that on the double mountaine dwel,
            And daily drink of the Caſtalian Well;
            If any Muſe among your ſacred number,
            Haue power to waken from a dying ſlumber;
            A dull conceit, drown'd in a gulph of griefe,

            While I in honor of a happy choice,
            To chearefull Layes tune my lamenting voice;
            Making the mountaines and the vallies ring,

            Behold, already in the ruddy Eaſt
            Bright Ericyna with the beaming creſt,
            Calles vp Aurora, and ſhe roſe-like bluſhing,
            Frō aged Tythons cold armes, quickly ruſhing,
            Opens the wide gates of the welcome day,
            And with a becke ſummons the Sunne away,
            Who quickly mounting on his gliſtering chaire,
            Courſeth his nimble Courſers through the aire,
            With ſwifter pace then when he did purſue

            Fearing perhaps (as well he might) to miſſe

            Such, as at ſight (but for the kind reſpect
            Of loyall friendſhip, to a deare elect
            Child of the Muſes) had with hotter fier
            Inflam'd the wanton Delphian Gods deſier,
