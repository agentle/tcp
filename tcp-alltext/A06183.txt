               RIght Worshipfull, vnderstanding how like Scilirus the Scythians fagot you are all so tied togither with the brotherly bond of amitie, that no diuision or dissention can depart you; In memorie of your rare and vnited loues (the like whereof this barren age scarsely affordeth any) and in regard you are three ornaments in this Honourable Citie, whereof I esteeme my selfe a member: To consecrate your vertues with my fame, I haue boldlie

Accept (I most humblie intreat you) this deseruing kindnesse from a gentleman, whose labours and curtesies being well construed, shall embolden him hereafter to aduenture on farre greater. Till when, I most humblie commend me: Written in hast, from my house at Low-Laiton, this 5. of Nouember. 1596.
            
               Your Worships in all kindnesse, T. L.

(for if Plato lie not, they are in the aire like Atomi in sole, mothes in the sonne.) Faith, earthly Deuils in humane habits, wherof some sit on your pillows when you sleepe, wait on

your tasters when you drinke, dresse ladies heads when they attire them, perfume courteours when they trim them, and become Panders if you hire them: and if you know them not rightly, they may hap to leaue their horns behind them among some of you. Buy therfore this Christall, and you shall see them in their common appearance; and read these exorcismes aduisedly, & you may be sure to coniure them without crossings: but if any man long for a familiar for false dice, a spirit to tell fortunes, a charme to heale diseased, this only booke can best fit him, let him but buy it, read it, and remember it, and if he be not well instructed when he hath ended it, he shall be a Deuill himselfe on my conscience without ending. Farewell and thanke him that hath studied thee so much profit; if thou doest not I pardon thee because thou doest as the world teacheth thee. Farewell.

            THE DEVILS INCARnate of this age.
            
               LOoking lately into the customes of these times, and coniecturing mens inward affections by their outward actions; I gather with Ierome, that this world is the house of confusion, & that the old Prouerbe in these dayes hath greatest probability and truth, that 
                  Homo est homini doemon, Man vnto man is a deuill. For who considereth wis
                  •…
               ly what hée séeth, and compareth that which should be, with that which is; may rightly say, that the Epicure conceited not so many Imaginary worlds, as this world containeth Incarnate deuils. Incarnate deuils, quoth you? why there are none such: then are there no men, say I, that delight to be vicious; and that true sentence is frustrate, 
                  Totus mundus in maligno positus est, The whole world is set on mischiefe. Come, come, let vs take the painting from this foule face, pull off the couer from this cup of poyson, rip vp the couert of this bed of serpents, and we shall discouer that palpably, which hath long time béene hidden cunningly: How? say you: Mary thus if you please: Compare things past, and you shall conceit harmes present.
            
               When that old serpent the deuill (who with his tayle, drewApoc. 12. vnto him the third part of the starres, and with his seuen heads and ten hornes, combated with Michael and his Angels) was ouercome: knowing (like a wily foxe as hée is) that his power was limited by a greater, and himselfe restrained by the mighty: yet willing to become Gods Ape (whome in enuie hée could not ouercome) hée sent out seuen deuils to draw the world to capitall sinne, as God had appointed seuen capitall Angels (who continually minister before him) to infuse vertues into men, and reduce soules to his seruice. And as the seuen good are Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Ariel, Euchudiel, Barchiel, and Salthiel: So of Sathans ministers, Leuiathan is the first, that tempteth with Pride; Mammon the second, that attempteth by Auarice; Asmodeus the third, that seduceth by Lecherie: Beelzebub the fourth, that inciteth to Enuie: Baalberith the fist, that prouoketh to Ire: Beelphogor the sixt, that mooueth Gluttony: Astaroth the seuenth, that induceth Sloth and Iolenes.
            These seuen capitall sinnes sent out into the world, wanted no allurements to bewitch the eie; no oratory, to seduce the eare; no subtilty, to affect the sences: so that finally, seazing on the hearts of men, and wedded to their thoughts, they haue brought foorth many and pernicious children, to the generall mischiefe of all nature. Some like Centaures, begotten of clouds, (as Ambition:) some like Serpents, nourished in corrupt dunghils, (as Sensualitie:) some like vapors, raised vp to be consumed, (as Flattery.) Generally all so dangerous, that as rust deuonreth the iron, and the moth the garment, so do these sinnes our soules.

                     LEuiathan the eldest, after that (in the former ages and infancie of the world) hée had peruerted Nembrod, brought Nious to confusion, begun tyranny in the first, and monarchie in the next; when in the kingdoms of the East hée had left no regall seate vnstained with blood; & in the West, the true faith affronted by many herefies: at last waxing old (& more fruitfull and subtill in doing mischiefe) hée raised vp these contentious spirits to peruert our world (which retaining now a daies and that very scarsely the only memory of the temperance of their forefathers, are wholly diuerted and turned from the meane, and accustomed for the most part in the extreames of all vertue and godlinesse.) His first sonne is Vainglory, who séeing his father waxen old in complotting villanies, broken by fatall contentions, spent by many poisons, and impouer

In chiefe places he appears not but in the coat of Singularity, reioicing vainly in those stratagemes, which at last are determined in his owne ruine: witnesse Alcibiades, who (as Plutarch reporteth) nourished in his vaine felicities, perished vnhappily by inconsideration and incontinencie. Of late daies knowing that his grandfather determines to keepe graund Christmasses in hel, he hath insinuated himselfe into the city in these kind of furnitures & apparitions, to prouide him store of fuell to furnish Sathans house of Distresse, and common place of Confusion. In Powls hée walketh like a gallant Courtier, where, if hée méet some rich chuffes worth the gulling, at euery word he speaketh, hée makes a mouse of an elephant, he telleth them of wonders done in Spaine by his ancestors: where, if the matter were well examined, his father was but Swabber in the ship where Ciuill Oranges were the best merchandize: draw him into the line of history, you shall heare as many lies at a breath, as would breed scruple in a good conscience for an age: talke with him of trauels, ware thirty thousand crownes in eggeshels at a Venetian banquet: if any worthy exploit, rare stratageme, plausible pollicie, hath euer past his hearing, hée maketh it his owne by an oath: nay, to speake the whole pith of his commendations, truths are as rare in his mouth, as adulteries in Sparta. Touch me his hat, it was giuen him by Henry the second of Fraunce, when hée kist the Reintgraues wife at his going into Almaine: commend the fashion of his beard, hée tels you it is the worke of a Turkish barber: his band was a prize gotten in Transiluania; where the truth is, he bought it in the Exchange for his mony: Charles the Emperour gaue his cloake: his sword was Mountdragons, all that hée hath if you beléeue him, are but gifts in reward of his vertue: where (poore asse as he is) were hée examined in his owne nature, his courage is boasting, his learning ignorance, his ability weaknesse, and his end beggery: yet is his smooth tongue a fit bait to catch Gudgeons; and such as saile by the wind of his good fortune, become Camelions like Alcibiades, féeding on the vanity of his tongue with the foolish credulity of their eares. Sometime like a Merchant he haunteth the Exchange; there

For he that delighteth to challenge all things to himselfe, defraudeth his reason of Light, and his mind of Iudgement. Beware of this Deuill friends, for if you make him a souldier, you shall find a false heart, or howsoeuer you thinke him, a very ideot. A Father speaking of him, saith,

               The next sonne Leuiathan presenteth, is Ambition, catching at nothing but stars, climing for nothing but crownes. This gallant Deuill moouing at the first (before his Incarnation) a mutiny in heauen among the Angels, hath now assumed a body to raise tumults on the earth, and breake 
                     sacrum societatis vinculum, the sacred bond of society.

It was Ambition at first that of Deioces a iust Iudge, made an vniust Mede, and a tyrant. It was hée that

If hée arise from obscurity, (as Changuis a smith, who as Lewis Regius witnesseth became Emperour of the Tarters) or from the potters furnace, as Agathocles:) hée laboureth tooth and naile to be skilfull in those things which are most plausible to the greater sort, and tollerable among the commons: his studie is for ostentation, not vertues sake: his bookes like Mansolus tombe, are comely without, but within nothing but rotten bones, corrupt practises▪ his apparell increaseth with his fortune, and as the inconstancy of worldly affaires direct him, so suteth hée both fashions and affections: and as vainly he desireth all things, so miserably feareth hée all men. In his study hée affecteth singularity, and is more proud in being the author of some new sect or heresie, then a good man is humble in the fulnesse of his knowledge: come hée into the eye of the world, hée créepeth into seruice with men of good credit, in féeding whose humors (hauing perhaps for want of some issue, made intrusion into some heritage) he matcheth not according to his birth, but

Growne this step higher, the authoritie likes him not without the stile, wherin if any crosse him, look for poison in his cup, or conspiracy in his walks, or detractions among his equals: yea, so pestilent is his nature, that (like fire in the embers) he neuer sheweth but to consume both himselfe and others: if hée perceiue any that by ripe iudgement c

Will you know his method? mary this it is: if the nature of the noble man whom hee enuieth be flexible, he bringeth him in feare either of his faithfull seruants in his priuat family, or his trusty familiars that loue his honor, or (if hée hath but some inckling of suspect, or some mislike betwixt his Prince and him,) hée plaieth Lucian in lying, leauing no meanes vnsought, but (as the Oratour saith, Omnem moltens lapidem) either to enforce feare or mooue hatred: this done, hée worketh on the contrary side, incensing the Prince by some probable surmises (sworne and confirmed by his flatterers and intelligencers,) till the Noble looseth either his land, authority, or place, and hée attaine both his stile and promotion.

be more able in others mischiefes: to those he fauoureth, and such as further his procéedings, hee is a Patron to protect their writings, and a Iudge to dissemble their escapes: yea, if any of his traine hath offended the law, he writes as Agesilaus did to Hidrieus Cares in the behalfe of Nicias, Niciam si nihil peccaui

If Nicias (saith he) hath offended nothing, dismisse him; if he be faulty, release him for my sake: howsoeuer it be, set him at liberty. If (according to Machiauels doctrine) he haue a great State opposed against him to preuent his encrease, with him he plaieth as the Ape with his yong ones, he kils him with coaksing him, he giues aime to his error, shewes patience if hée thwart him, encourageth him to dangers, vrgeth on his rashnes, and thus like a little worme, eateth through a great tree, and by obseruing times, winneth his triumph: of all things a likes not to heare of Theophrastus lesson, that

Alas, how many are shipwrackt on this rock? (as that Atheist Iulian the Apostata) how many of these sorts (as Caesar, Phocas) in their age, Caesar Borgia (otherwise called Duke Valentinian) Corradine in Naples, Christierne of Denmarke, Ericus of Swethland, haue vnhappily drowned thēselues in this puddle?

Though he looke with a counterfait eie, none must see further then he, and whatsoeuer he saith, must he held an Aphorisme, or he flings house out of the window with his boastings.

Of this kind of Deuill there was one of late daies flourishing in Lions (a famous cittie in France) who was so much besotted with starre gazing, that he credibly beléeued that there was a certaine Diuinitie in the Sunne, the Moone, and other Planets, saying that the Sonne was true God, which he tearmed the chiefest light and Supremum genus, aboue all the Categories of Aristotle, but after a little Eleborus had purged him, and reason conuicted him, he recanted.

If hée receiue graces from God, it not his mercie that giueth them, but his owne industrie; he is a right Pelagian, presuming by naturall vertue (without the grace of God) to attaine Paradise: Giue him what you can, hée condemnes you for your labor: he cals his maister old dunce that taught him learning; and to his father that brought him vp, he protests he knows him not poore groome, nay if he beg he scornes to reléeue him: his benefactors might haue kept their money with a vengeance: and for his Lord (if he serue at any time) none but Ingratitude if hée decay, will soonest sell him to a sergeant, he is the fittest instrument to hang his Maister, so that of Plautus is verie aptly applied vnto them.

                        i in perniciem, To an vngratefull man nothing is encreased, and that which he receiueth, turneth to his destruction. Pliny in the Prologue of his naturall Historie calleth them 
                     fures & infelices, Theeues, and vnhappie, that acknowledge no benefites: and Seneca the Philosopher counteth them worser then Serpents, for Serpents (saith he) cast out their poison to other mens destruction, but vngratefull men without their owne disgrace cannot be vnthankfull. Hermes Trimegestus counteth the best sacrifice to God to be Thankfulnesse, it followeth then à contrarijs that the worst thing in his sight is Ingratitude. The commenter vpon Aristotles Book De animalibus telleth a storie to this purpose: A certaine husbandman nourished an Aspis in his house, féeding him daily at his own table, and chearing him with his owne meat; it fortuned a little while after that hée brought forth two yong ones, the one of which poisoned the husbandmans sonne, and brought sorrow to his houshold: The old bréeder considering this (in the sight of the father) murthered the offender, and as if ashamed of his ingratitude, departed the house with the other. Behold sence of benefite in a Serpent, and will man be vnthankfull? The Lion that was healed by Andronicus in the wood, did he not saue his life in the Theator? Man consider this, and to bring thée the more in hatred with this fiend, weigh this one example of Seneca written in his fourth Booke De beneficijs: A certaine sould for indangered by shipwracke, and floating (for the space of twentie daies) on a broken mast in a sore tempest, was at last cast a shoare in a Noblemans Lordship, by whom he was reléeued with meat, clothes, and monie: This Nobleman comming to Philip of Macedon his King, and encountring a little after with this vnthankfull souldier, was by him accused of false Treason: and so much for the time did iniquitie preuaile, that not only he indangered the Noblemans life, but possest his goods likewise, by the beneuolence

of the King: notwithstanding truth (which according to Seneca in Oedipus, adit moras, hateth delay) being at last discouered, and the king assertained of the wretched souldiors ingratitude, he branded him in the face with a burning yron, and dispoiling him of his ill gotten goods, restored the other: so deale you by this Diuell of our age, and beware of his subtilties, for if once he proue an intelligencer, he will helpe to hang you.
               The next Harpie of this bréed is Scandale and Detraction, This is a right malecontent Deuill, You shall alwaies find him his hat without a band, his hose vngartered, his Rapier punto r'enuerso, his lookes suspitious and heauie, his left hand continually on his dagger: if he walke Poules, he sculks in the backe Isles, and of all things loueth no societies: if at any time he put on the habit of grauitie, it is either to backbite his neighbor, or to worke mischiefe: well spoken he is, and hath some languages, and hath red ouer the coniuration of Machiauel: In beleife he is an Atheist, or a counterfait Catholicke; hating his countrie wherein hée was bred, his gratious Prince vnder whom he liueth, those graue counsailors vnder whom the state is directed, not for default either in gouernement, or pollicy, but of méere innated and corrupt villanie; and vaine desire of Innouation. He hath béene a long Traueller, and séene manie countries, but as it is said of the toad, that he sucketh vp the corrupt humors of the garden where hée kéepeth; so this wretch from al those Prouinces he hath visited, bringeth home nothing but the corruptions, to disturbe the peace of his countrie, and destroy his owne bodie and soule. If he studie, it is how to dispence and frustrate statutes, and (being grounded by ill counsel, and prepared for mischiefe) he laboureth (as the Legist saith) not to auoid the sinne, but the penaltie. This fellow spares neither Nobilitie, Clergie, nor Laietie, but (like that Roman Emperor, vnworthie the naming) desireth that the whole people and comminaltie had but one head, that he might cut it off at one stroake. Let him haue no cause, he wisheth Vitellius miserie to maiestie, and swears by no small bugs, that all the world is imprudent that imploies him not: This is hée that in priute Conuenticles draws discontented Gentlemen to conspiracies,

Spartianus on the contrarie side, sheweth an example quite opposite to this, and this it was: during the Empire of Claudius, there died a certaine Romane called Pamphilus, who as was clearely prooued, had not in all his life time spoke one true word, but wholly delighted in lying and flatterie: for which cause the Emperour commaunded that his bodie should bee left vnburied, his goods should bée confiscate, his house ouerthrown, and his wife and children banished Roome, to the end that the memorie of a creature so venomous, should not liue and haue residence in his Commonweale. In which two things Messia vseth this obseruation, that in the time that these first effects happened, the Romanes were mortall enemies of the Egyptians, for which cause it may easilie bée séene how powerfull the force of truth is, since the Romanes raised a statue to their Enemie, and depriued their homeborne sonne and Cittizen of buriall for being a flattering lier: Hetherto hée, and here conclude I the description of this fiend.

                  ny; the man loues good dealing. If you desire commodities at his hand, why sir you shall haue them, but how? not (as the caterpillers wont to sell) at high prises, but as the best and easiest penyworth, as in conscience you can desire them: only this, at the insealing of the assurance, if you helpe him away with a chest of glasse for ten pound of ten shillings price, you shall command his warehouse another time. Tut he is for you at casuall marts, commodities of Proclamations, and hobby-horses, you shall haue all that you please, so hée receiue what he desires. It is a common custome of his to buy vp crackt angels at nine shillings the piece. Now sir if a gentleman (on good assurance of land) request him of mony, Good sir, (saith hée, with a counterfait sigh) I would be glad to please your worship, but my good mony is abroad, and that I haue, I dare not put in your hands. The gentleman thinking this conscience, where it is subtilty, and being beside that, in some necessity, ventures on the crackt angels, some of which can not flie for soldering, and paies double interest to the miser, vnder the cloake of honesty. If he failes his day, God forbid he should take the forfaiture, hée will not thriue by other mens curses, but because men must liue, and we are Infidels if we prouide not for our families, hée is content with this his owne; only a lease, a toy, of this or that manor, worth both his principall and ten times the interest, this is easie for the gentleman to pay, and reasonable in him to receiue. If a citizen come to borrow, my friend, quoth he, you must keepe day, I am glad to helpe young men without harming my selfe: then paying him out the mony and receiuing his assurance, he casts Iolly Robbins in his head how to cousin the simple fellow.

               A certaine gamester and drunkard, drowned in prodigality & sensuality, (more vnthriftie then Epicharides the dwarfe, who in fiue dayes spent all his patrimony in Athens; and like Ethiopus the Corinthian, who sold all his possessions to Archias, that hée might follow dishonest drinking) hauing consumed his whole estate: One day (being vehemently incensed by losse and misthiefe) in so bitter and terrible sort beat his poore wife, (who came to séeke reléefe from his hands, for her and her poore children) in y• sight of his ruffianly companions, that as he thought (and happily it had so fallen out) he left her dead, and past recouery. This desolate wretch at last returning to her selfe, and repairing backe againe to her houshold, behold, two her young babes, who grieuously oppressed with hunger, with teares in their eies (taught not to speake by age, but misery) required and desired her of sustenance; Mother, saith one, Meate, or I die: Mam, saith the other, and with signes speakes the rest. Alas, poore babes, saith the mother with bitter sighes, Where shall I get it? your father hath lost his patience, with his wealth; & we our hope, with his mishap: Alas, alas, what shal become of me?

or who shall succour you my children? better it is to die with one stroke, then to languish in continuall famine. Pressed by these miseries, and brought to this dispaire, shée tooke a knife in her hand, and cut her childrens throats, setting her selfe downe purposely to die, & perish in her sorows. Her husband the same euening returning laden with wine, & more fit to take rest then examine these tragedies, cast himselfe on his bed, neither dreaming on his losses, nor her miseries: She vrged on by Satan, y• euer watcheth opportunities, séeing him asléepe, y• regarded not her sorrow, wt the same knife where with she had kild her children, she cut his throat, the cause of her confusion; speaking thus boldly during ye time of her execution: Thou shalt die thou negligent man, since thy ill gouernment hath bene the ruine of me and my children. Day & time discouering these murders, the woman was apprehended; & examined by the Iustice, confessed the fact. Finally, she was condemned, & dying with much constancy, left examples to wiues to beware of too much fury, & admonitions to husbands to be more circumspect. Sée here how this cursed inuention of the Lydians hath bene the occasion of the murder of foure persons: In reading therefore this history, be prouident to auoid and shun this Deuill.

                     Crescit amor nummi quantum ipsapecunia crescit,

                     And who possesseth least doth least desire.
                  
               
               It were too long to recken vp all other authorities of Cicero, Virgil, Ouid, and Horace, for this were but to heape vp reading and moone no affection, I onely vrge to

consideration, and by it to hatred of the sinne. Let vs therfore leaue foolish carking in this world, and remember we are made men to behold heauen, and not mowles to dig in the earth. Denounce (saith Paul to Timothy) to them that are rich in this world that they be not proud, neither fixe their hope on the incertenty of riches, but in the liuing God, who giueth vs all things aboundantly whatsoeuer wee need. Let the Magistrate consider this, that as when the Moone appeareth in the spring time, the one horne spotted and hidden with a blacke and great cloud, from the first day of his apparition to the fourth day after, it is some signe of tempests and troubles in the aire the Sommer after: so if Secular and temporall Magistrates (who according to Ecclesiastes are changed like the Moone) shall haue their mindesEccles. 27. spotted with the clouds of Auarice and earthly desires, it is a signe of subsequent trouble amongst the people: For the Soueraignes couetousnesse is the oppression of the subiect. O worldling, looke as the interposition of the earth betwixt the Sunne and the Moone, is the cause of the Eclipse of the same; so the interposition of worldly goods betwixt our minds and God, is the cause of our blindnes in vnderstanding. Heare Augustine whatAug. lib. de doctr. Christ. he saith, 
                     Amas pecuniam quam nunquam videbis, caecus possides, caecus moriturus es, quod possides hic relicturus es: Thou louest mony which thou shalt neuer see, blind thou possessest it, blind thou must die, and that which thou enioyest, thou must leaue behind thee. A couetous man is like him that is sick of the dropsie, who the more hée aboundeth in disordinate humors, the more excéedingly he desireth and thirsteth; and the more he thirsteth, the more he drinketh, till at last he dieth: So the more stored a couetous man is with riches, which hée vseth not, the more ardently desires he the possession of more.
               The Couetous man likewise is very rightly compared to hell, for with possessing in excesse, he is still insatiate. The couetous man buyeth earth, and sells his soule made for heauen: and looke as water (saith Augustine) is poured on the earth, so thirst they after the blood of their neighbours.

                  NO sooner came Asmodeus into the world by Sathans direction, but presently procured he Lothes incest with his daughters, Semiramis vnlawfull whordome with her owne sonne, and Dinas vnhappy and fatall rauishment; he made Thamar be enforced by her owne brother, and forced Dauid to commit murther on Vrias, and adultery with Bersabe: Pasiphae hée brought enamoured with a Bull, and Xerxes with a Plantaine trée: hée caused a young Athenian to fall in loue with the liuelesse picture of Fortune standing neare the Pritaneum, and to offer a great quantity of mony to the Senate to buy it from their hands; of which being denied, and for which wholly inraged, after embracing, kissing, (and such other ceremonies) he crowned the statue, & lamenting, slew himselfe: he made Glauca of Cythera to loue

a dog, a young Spartan to be besotted on a bird, Xenophon to affect a hound, nay the better part of the Philosophers to be Sodomites: read Plutarchs booke of Loue, and hée will testifie for me: yet thinking these gaines too little in expression of his enuy, watching Sardanapalus one night, hée practised this monstrous villany: Hée assembled his hainousest thoughts, & compacted them togither, hée chained his loosest desires, to the inward workings and motions of the same; and after hée had drunke of Letheo, which (as the Poet saith) causeth forgetfulnes,

He spights him most that examines his procéedings, and will chafe till he sweat againe, if a man touch him with his infirmities. Speake ought that bréeds a hate of sinne, it is a verie Hell to him: blesse your selfe out of this fiends companie, for these certaine and exampler respects, that follow, First because adulterie is a greater sinne, and more hatefull (as some schoolemen say, in the sight of God) then periurie.Lenit. 20. Deut. 21. Next, because Gods law forbids it, and example dissuades it. By the law adulterers were stoned to death. Before the law they were punished by death; as appeareth by Iudas iustice on Thamar: examples of the hainousnesse of this sinne appeareth in many places; thousands of men died in the fields of Moab for this fault, and sixtie thousand of the children of Israell were put to the sword for the onelie rauishing of a Leuites wife. Thirdlie, for these respects is this adulterie to bée eschewed, first because it impugneth the law of nature, Next the law of countries; and last, for that it hath béene the ruine of manie Citties and kingdomes. If in the law of nature it had not béene odious, Pharoah and Abimelech had not answered Abraham, That had they supposed Sara for his wife, they had not taken her.

He holds this ariome, That there is no pleasure swéet that is not accompanied with resist; and that no flowers are pleasant but those of the first gathering. He it was that rauished Danae in a golden shewer, & Mica the chast Uirgine in the daies of Aristotimus. All wordly delights he hath to intangle innocency with, and his grandsir Sathan hath giuen it him from the cradle, to attempt the chastest: intertaine him to your guest, your Uirgines are corrupted, your kindred desamed, your children pointed at, and that which is a great miserie

This spiritual infirmite is compared to the disease of leprosie, which procéeedeth from corrupt and disordinate heat; and as the leprosie3. Reg. 8. is an incurable disease, euen so is lust an irremediable mischiefe: With this infirmitie was Salomon infected,

who had seuentie Quienes and thrée hundreth concubines, so that euen in his age his heart was depraued: and whereas in al other sinnes their venome is not contracted by societie, in lust a man by conuersation may be corrupted: so that neither the wise mans wit, neither the strong mans armes, nor the holy mans meditation is defenced against lust, but as Ierome saith, ad Paulum & Eus

               Lust conquereth the most vntamed minds. As soon saith Gregorie, as lust hath possessiō of the mind, it scarsly suffereth it to conceiue any good desires, and in that the desires therof are vicious by the suggestion thereof riseth corrupt thought, and of thought the like affection, & of affection delèctation, & of delight consent, & of cōsent operation, & of operatiō custome, & of custome desperation, and of desperation, defence of sinne and glorieng therein, and of glorying in sinne, damnation. Lururious men haue outwardly the Deuill suggesting them; and inwardly concupiscence incensing them; and of these two, al carnal sinn̄es are begotten. It is likewise to be noted, that the word of God, is two waies indemnified by lasciuious men, the one way is conculcator a transeuntibus, It is troden downe by them as they passe by it: This treading downe and oppression of the word of God, is the custome of euill thoughts, whereby the Gospell is oppressed: The second is, that it is deuoured of birds; which deuouring is the suggestion of the Deuill. Against these defects there are likewise two remedies, the first is, that we fence in the inclosure of our hearts, with the thornes of the memorie of the passion of Christ, according to that of the wise man, 
                     Popule sepi aures
                     Eccles. 28. 
                     tuas spinis.
                   For there is no greater remedie saith Origen, nor better means against euill cogitations, then the remembrance of Christs passion. The second remedie is, to fatten this inclosure of our hearts with the vertue of charitie; for of it it is said, That it couereth the multitude of sinnes. To conclude a sea of matter in a short circle of admonition, refraine lust and her progenie for these causes, First it destroieth the infused graces of God, and the gifts of the holie ghost: Secondly, it consumeth the foure cardinall vertues: Thirdly, it weakeneth the body, inféebleth the spirit, and hardeneth the heart against all deuotion.

The armor against this enuie, is, The cōsideration of his deformitie, The auoidance of occasions and motions of desire, The tempering and moderation of our corrupt bodies, The continuall thought of impendent death, The imagination of Gods continuall presence, The consideration of those infirmities wherewith it cloieth the spirit: Lastly in assaults, The office of praier; which as Cassianus saith, is a sufficient buckler against all the

Your wife I trow was Iealosie the daughter of a corrupt spirit, who could neuer find in her heart to dresse her selfe, for feare a pin should kill her; nor look into the aire, for feare she should be blasted▪ nor drink of water, in doubt she should be poisoned: God amercy for that nod hornd beast for it showes thy confession.

               A great and mighty Lord desirous to know the difference betwixt an enuious & couetous man commāded a seruant of his to bring one of both sorts to his presence: to whom (after some courtly salutations) he made this offer, that aske what they would he would grant it them, on that condition, that he might giue the second the double of that the first demanded: these two vnderstanding the summe of the Noblemans intent, fell at debate betwixt themselues which of them should wish first; the couetous, desiring to wish last, by reason of the commoditie depending thereon, and the enuious disdaining the other should haue more then he. At last the Nobleman séeing their contention without end, & desirous to sée the issue of his expectation, cō
                  manded the enuious to begin, reseruing the couetous the latter choice; But what desired he thinke you, being preferred to this election? Forsooth, nought els but that one of his eies might bée pulled out, to the end the other might loose both his, chusing rather the losse then the profit, to the end that he whom he enuied might haue mischiefe with the aduantage: whereby wée may easilie vnderstand, in what blindnesse and error that miserable man is, that suffereth himselfe to bée conquered by this cursed humor: to conclude with Iob, this sortIob. 5. of maligning enuie killeth a foole, I wish therefore that all wise men should flie it.

The last deuil of this race (for Iealousie is barren, but in increasing hir own mischiefs) is Worldly fear, he neuer walks abroad but in suspition, if a butchers hook do but catch him by the sléeue, he cries out, At whose sute? he is stil in iealousie that euery man wil excéed him, & attēpreth nothing in vertue, through y• suspect of his corrupt nature: because he wanteth charity, he is stil in dread, & the only fée of his fortune is the suspect of his ability: he hath courage inough to aduenture on any sinne, but touching the domages of his bodie, there is not an arranter coward. He trusts no man for fear he deceiue him, if he heare of any of his equals in election of an office, he trembles like an aspen leafe, in doubt that his aduancement should be a hinderance to him: according to that in Claudian,

               And that of Tullie in his Epistle to Torquatus, Plus in metuendo est mali, quam in eo ipso quod timetur: There is more euill in fearing, then in that which is feared. This fiend was he that possessed Dionysius the elder, giuing him a greater hell by his suspicion, then danger by his enemies hatred. Of all other deuils let good men blesse them from this; for though he séeme contemptible in his owne abiectiues, yet whatsoeuer mind hée seazeth vpon, (as Granatensis saith) hée shewes himselfe to be a powerfull perturbation, making of litle things, great; and of great, monstrous. The children of Beelzebub thus briefly brought in knowledge, let vs with some consideration examine the workings, & giue remedie against the assaults of the father. Enuie in his nature is agrieued at the prosperity of another man; he enuieth y• great, since he can not equall them: hée enuieth the weake, dreading they should compare themselues with him: finally, he enuieth his equals, because he were very loth they should be his companions. In Kingdoms, Common-weales, Princes courts, and priuat families, he is still working; no man hunteth after honour, but he affronts him: only the miserable man he maligneth not, because he suspects not his risings; yet hath he a scorne for him, such as Phalaris had to heare Perillus groning and roaring in his brasen Bull. This capitall sin of all other is of most antiquity, and shall be of longest continuance. Grieuous were the warres raised by this fiend betwixt the Romans and Carthaginians, and as fatall those betwixt Caesar and Pompey, who contended not vpon iniuries but vpon enuies. Hée it was that poisoned Socrates, slew Crassus, destroied Darius, ouerthrew Pyrrhus, brought Cyrus to his end, made Cataline infamous, and Sophomy be vnfortunate. Hermocrates the tyrant of Cicely knowing the venim of this vice, gaue his sonne this last, and not the least instruction: That he should not be enuious, (adding thereunto this consequence) But do thou (saith hée) such déeds, that others may enuy thée: for to be euuied is the token

of good deserts; but to be enuious, the signe of a corrupt nature. It is Tullius in his Orator; that the most flourishing fortune is alwaies enuied: agréeing with that in Quid,
               
               
                  Summa petit liuor, perflant altissima venti:

               This infirmitie is compared to a simple feuer, that is now hot, straight cold; for now doth the enuious man reioice at the aduersitie of the good, now waxe sad at the prosperitie of the righteous. Cain was sicke of this disease, enuying the prosperity of Abel: Rachel enuied the fecunditie and fruitfulnesse of Lea; Saul, the felicity of Dauid. To conclude, the fall of y• world, and the death of Christ, was wrought by this sinne. Wisely saith Cassiodorus, Quicquid ex inu

There is no man rightly enuieth another mans knowledge, but hée that suspecteth his owne. The remedie of this vice (as Albertanus saith). Is the loue of God, and of our neighbour: and in ascribing all things to the goodnes of God, we shall haue nothing to maligne at, which is good in his creatures. Besides, if we hate death (as a thing most contrary and grieuous to nature) we must néedly hate Enuie, that first brought it into the world. The blessed soules (saith Gregory) do as much reioice at the felicitie of others, as their owne. It is then consequently an act of the cursed, to be agrieued at any mans prosperity.

               The incarnate monsters begotten by the Arch-Deuill Baalberith.
               
               
                  AMongst all the monstrous ingendrings, and wonders of nature, (set downe by Pliny, Aristotle, and Elian in his histories) the begetting of Baalberiths children is the most miraculous: for touching procreation by mouth, by eares, and by other parts, they are confirmed by knowledge & experience; but for y• heart to be a place of conception, I held it a thing impossible, except it be in a Deuill. Yet as impossible as it is, true it is, and in a Deuill it was; and thus Baalberith became a father: When by those tirannies that ranged in the Primitiue Church from Aurelius to Valerian, this cursed spirit of wrath, rather augmented then dismembred the faithfull, he sate him downe in a méere agony, and began to imagine in his thoughts how to destroy Patience in mens hearts, which is an opposed enemy to all his procéedings. Hereon inflaming his heart (by the hot cholerick and swift blood which he sent out of his vaines by Caua vena to it) there rose certaine spéedy and vehement spirits encountring with his sinister thoughts, that (forced out by his beating and heauy lungs) tooke passage with his breath▪ and no sooner entred the aire but attained bodies, in which they worke, and by which they are known. Tec first of them became a Ruffian, a Swashbuckler, and a Bragart, they call him Brawling contention; his common gate is as proud as a Spaniards, his ordinary apparell is a little low crownd hat with a fether in it like a forehorse; his haires are curld, and full of elues locks, and nitty for want of kembing; his eies are still staring, and he neuer lookes on a man but as if he would eate him: his doublet is of cast Satten, cut sometime vpon Taffata, but that the

bumbast hath eaten through it, and spotted here and there with pure fat, to testifie that he is a good trencher man: his common course is to go alwaies vntrust, except when his shirt is a washing, & then he goes woolward: and his bréeches are as desperate as himselfe, for they are past mending: his weapons are a basket hilted sword, and a bu

Then let the host crosse him, out goes his dagger; let the hostesse intreat him, shée is a whore for her labour, and though hée drinke beyond his stocke, thats but a custome.

This is a chiefe caterpiller in a citie, and too much winckt at: hée hath alreadie insected the most part of the suburbs, it were great pittie to graunt him harbour in the citie. Isidorus saith

                   First, he is alwaies ready to Quarrell: secondly, he taketh his best pleasure in Strife & Debate: thirdly, he prouoketh others vnto Discord. Of all Baalberiths bréed, there can not be an arranter or more currish villaine, and peruerter of peace; and his impatience in iniury, commeth of his carnall mind. Of all companions there is none that more deserueth the auoiding then hée; for whosoeuer falleth into his humor of impatience, he presently becommeth the disciple of the Deuill, and fit and apt for all euill things.

It was he that taught them in their Talmud to excommunicate God for taking R. Ehezers part against them: and incensed that cursed lim of their sinagogue to say, That entering Paradice by subtilty, he deceaued both God and the Deuill.

if his purge worke not presently; and kill his horse, if he gallop not when he commands him: he is like captaine Cloux foole of Lyons that would néeds die of the sullens, because his master would entertaine a new foole besides himselfe: this deuill is an arrant swearer, a swift striker, a short liuer, thrée good marks to know him by, and of all his imperfections this is not the least, that if he be detracted he stormeth, be it either iustly or vniustly, not considering what an honour it was for Zerxes, Caesar, Domitian, Titus, Traian, and Tiberius, who being certified that a certaine man had spoken ill of him, answered, That tongues are frée in a city. For to heare a mans fault is wisdome, but to be flattered is méere misery. A certaine Emperour confirming the lawes of Theodosius, Arcadius, and of Homer, said thus: If any one not knowing the law of modesty, so far forth forget himselfe to speake ill of vs, our will is, that he be not punished for the same, for if it procéed of lightnesse of spirit, and readinesse of tongue, it is to be neglected: if it procéed of folly or choller, it is to be pitied: and if it procéed of iniury, it is to be pardoned: A golden saying, and worthy an Emperour, which if you follow my friends, you haue a sufficient spell about you, to coniure the spirit of Impatience from you. Thus haue I briefly shewed you the whelpes of Wrathes litter: now for a conclusion, let vs a litle canuase this cursed fiend Baalberith. To discourse therefore of this immoderate passion (procéeding from the sensetiue appetite, as Aquine saith) it is the increase of the gall (according to the Phisitians) but the decrease of all modesty, by the law of reason: for he that is affected with this short madnesse (according to Seneca) is angry with his quill if it deliuer not inke; with his dice, if he play and loose, and then he bites them: his gesture is inconstant, he looks red in the gils like a Turkie cocke, his eie lids are deprest, his lips tremble, his tongue stutters, and he is vnquiet in all his body. Sometimes from words he breaketh into cries, from cries into slaunders, from slaunders into contumely, from contumelies into cursings, from cursing into blasphemies. Sometime like an ague it seaseth the whole body, & somtimes

What shall I say? this Deuill in all men darkeneth reason, & confoundeth memory: and as smoke drweth a man out of his house, so wrath erpelleth the Holy-Ghost from our hearts. Those that write of Ire, disswade and debar men from the vse thereof for thrée causes: First, because it iniureth God; next, their neighbours; and lastly themselues. For from God it taketh the effect of his power; from our neighbour it taketh the affect of due beneuolence; and from mens selues it taketh the aspect of reason and vse of intelligence. For first of all, it behooueth God in respect of his power, iudicially to reuenge and punish sinne, spiritually to inhabite the good, and liberally to bestow his benefits on them. But the Irefull man is contrarious to God in all these things: first, hée taketh from God his reuenge, because Ire is a disordinate appetite of reuenge: and God saith, To me belongeth reuenge, Et ipse retribuum,
                   For GodRom. 13. hath reserued two things vnto himselfe, glory, & reuenge; and the proud man robbeth him of the one, and the irefull man of the other: secondly, an Irefull man iniureth God, because he expelleth him from the rest of his habitation:

                   Thirdly, wrath drewneth & destroieth in a mans owne selfe three kind of goods: For first of all, it subuerteth the honestly of corporall disposition: secondly, it hindreth reason: and thirdly, shorteneth life. That it destroieth the honesty and comelinesse of mans disposition, it appeareth, because how faire soeuer a man be, it deformeth his lookes, it discōlours his face, it altereth his gesture, it transporteth his tongue, and euery way disgraceth him. And therefore Seneca faith▪ Nothing more profiteth an Irefull man then to behold his owne deformity: and therefore another Philosopher said, that it was requisite for a wrathfull man to sée his owne face in a myrrour, to the end, that by the reflexion thereof, hée might behold his unnaturall alteration. It is said of Minerua, that being delighted in the musicke of a cornet, she once plaid by a transparant and christall fountaines side, wherein spying her chéekes mightily puft and swollen with winding, shee cast away her instrument, and repined the further vse of it: As it happened to Minerua the goddesse of wit, so fortuneth it often times to many wise men subiect to indignation, who somtimes distracted with Ire, and perceiuing in the cléere fountaine of their iudgement, the vndecencie and errour thereof, vtterly disclaim
                     •…
                  : secondly wrath hindreth the power of reason, according to Catos saying:

                     Impedit ingenium ne possit cernere verum,
                  
                  It hindreth the iudgement and vnderstanding, least it should discerne truth: and for that cause the Deuill behaueth himselfe like a cunning fisherman, who purposing to catch and insuare the fish more cunningly, troubleth the waters, to the end, that blinding their sight, they may the sooner fall in his net. In like manner doth the Deuill demeane himselfe, who striuing to draw men to sinne, hee stirreth perturbation, strife, and dissentious among them, to the end they may the sooner fall into sinne, and be seduced by his mallice. Aristotle in the first of his Topiques saith, that Ire neuer subuerteth reason, but when the mind and soule is peruerse and froward: and euen as it is the craft of the1.

pollicte of the Deuill to blind our vnderstanding with wrath, least we would discerne his villany: thirdly, Ire shorteneth life, as may appeare in beasts, which being naturally chollericke, haue but short time of continuance; as namely, in the dog, and that in Ecclesiastes it is approoued, where it is said, 
                     Zelus & iracundia minuent dies, & ante tempus senectam adducent, Zeale and wrath shorten life, end hasten age. It is said of the Duyr (a stone gathered in India and Arabia) that it

Seneca in his third booke de Ira faith, If it be a friend that offended, hee did that he would not: if an enemy, he did as he ought: So howsoeuer displeasures come, if they be wisely construed, they are easily digested.

and litle will in such sort créepe and attaine to the feiguurie of the heart, that by no meanes or medicine it will be vuseated therefrom. The heauen (said Gallen) hath so much fauoured me, that I had a iust, good, and courteous father, & no waies oppressed with passion and choller; whose good precepts and instructions, I haue euer retained: for at no time, in what choller soeuer he hath béene, haue I séene him transported so farre, as to strike any man, but (which more is) hée had alwaies a custome to reprehend those, that beat and stroke their subiects and seruants. But if I were fortunate in a father (said he) I was lesse fortunate in a mother, for I had one the most chollericke and troublesome woman liuing vpon the earth, shée was alwaies at the staffes end with my father, to whome shée was no lesse troublesome, then was earst Xantippe to her Socrates: she neuer ceased to raile against him, continually filling the house wt tumult, yea, choller had such power in her from her youth, that when she entred into any discontents, she finng, stampt, strooke, yea so far forgot her selfe, that she strooke her chambermaids. The same author saith like wise, that the first time he began to detest that vice, was, that being a young lad he beheld a man seased with this passion, who was so far disguised by choller, that hée séemed rather a monster then a man, for hée had his countenance changed, his eies staring, his haires bristling on his head, his lookes furious, and all the rest of his body trembling, and agitated with fury; he cried, he stamped, he threatned, he fomed at the mouth like a bore, and to conclude, he shewed such strange, insolent, and prodigious countenauces, that hée gaue manifest euidence that this brutall passion, brings a man besides himselfe, and makes him like vnto beasts. Thus farre Gallen, by whose counsell if wée propose vnto our selues the image and picture of a distempered and wrathfull man, no doubt but the obscene, filthy, and lothsome behauiour which he vseth, will bring vs in detestation of his vice, and determination to auoid and conquer such like perturbations and affections.

I was (will he say) somtime in a Tauerne, and it was with some of my neighbours that it was (this drinkes too flat Iohn, fill better, saith he, and carousing in stead of a full point he prosecutes his matter,) and it chanced as we were a drinking I saw mine host carry two pitchers full of water into his wine seller, hauing two other carried after by his apprentice full of good wine (as I supposed:) now Sir, (suspecting same knauery) I thrust my head out of the window, and cried mainly with a full throat, Fire, fire, fire; By reason it was somewhat towards night (now a bit, & then a cup more) I was quickly heard, so that at the last, the Tauerne was full of all sorts of people, some bringing water, (as the contrary to fire,) others oile, (good to quench lightning,) some ladders to clime the house

I also hoarse with crying, at last answered them that it was in the seller, and I was sure of it, and for proofe therof (quoth I) I saw the host very now carrie down store of water. They hearing this, sodainly ran downe into the seller, where they found the Tauerner with his prentice mingling wine and water together, all the companie detesting his knauerie, one cast his paile of water at his head, another his oile, another his vineger, another broke a sticke out of his lather, and all to bebeat him: the host souced in souce like a pickled herring, ran away to saue himselfe, the people fell a drinking til they left him neuer a drop in his seller, and I (a pottle more of Charnico, Edward) without paying pennie for my Wine, went away with the goblet, (and I drinke to you good man Pouling) this last period is a pottle at least, and how say you by my taleteller?

The King ashamed at this reprehension, shakt of sléepe, recouered his sences, and gaue more diligent regard to the cause, and at last finding right on her side, reuersed the Iudgement, and acquited the woman. By which it appeareth, that the shaking off of dronkennesse, is the establishing of reason, and the custome thereof the destruction of honestie: That it is the complement of voluptuousnesse and pleasure it appeareth likewise, for modestie restraineth manie men from sinne, and where it is taken away and subdued by wine, the pleasure that lies hidden in the heart, is discouered without shame.

And if you inquire of his forces, he thinks the countrey may well bring 140 thousand furnisht horse into the field vpon occasion of seruice. If you fall in question of the Turke

his knowledge is this that he hath alwaies in prest for the war 130 thousand Timariste, (who are waged by lands which the Turke hath giuen them, to the end they should entertain so many horse at his command) he hath beside them 14 thousand Ianisaries, and 36 thousand Spaies, continually waged by mony: Besides all those that goe into the war or haue any place or dignity vnder him, are either Apostataes, or the sonnes of Renegados; as for the Turks by race, they are alwaies kept in seruitude and pouertie, either exercised in Marchandise or seruing in the Temples. Touching his reuenue hée hath nine millions of gold, (besides the presents which his officers send him, and the lands of his owne demeasne,) besides he hath Daces or taxes of the Iews and Christians euery one paying him a Shikin a year. And touching his gouernors, he saith they are Basshawes, and that the continuance of their authorities is but from thrée yeares to thrée yeares. Bring the Pope in question, he can tell you this (for perhaps he hath knowne his beneuolence) that hée built the Seminary of the Iesuits of an hospital, contrary to the will of the dead; and how he hath taken thrée hundreth crownes of pencion lately from them, so that now they haue but sixe hundreth to maintaine themselues: he is séen in many other things likewise which I must not speake of, but beware of multiplying words with him, for though hée butt not with his horns because he will not bée thought a cuckold, hée will giue a shroud wound with his tongue, that may bring a man to his neckeverse: hee hath continually a warrant in his pocket, and vnder colour of attaching Traitors, troubles and spoiles many honest men.

               It resteth now (according to course) that I speake somewhat of the deformity of Beelphogor the father, since I haue in part scored out the vncleannesse of his children. Gluttony (as the Schoolemen write) is (both according to the habitude and act) a disordinate delight in eating and drinking, a mortall enemy of the vertue of temperance; offending both in quantity, quality, time, and manner. It was first introduced from Asia into Rome, where (corruptions commonly being the swiftest in springing) it became from a seruile thing, the delight of the soueraignes: so that Apicius (an abiect cooke that profest the art of cookery in the kitchin) was not ashamed afterward to step into the schoole, and declaime in praise of it, whome for his insatiable abuses and inuentions, Pliny (and that rightly) called the Gulfe of prodigality. To this sinne Milo Crotoniates and Tagon (the belly-ged) were so addicted, that the one bare an Oxe on his shoulders, and after denoured it; and the other (at the table of Autelian the Emperor) eat a Goat, a Hog, and drunke a Tierse of wine, and far more in boast of his intemperance.

And now a daies our world rather superior then inferiour to other ages, in these kind of infirmities, neglecteth nothing in sensuality: our bankets are sauced with surfets, so that Beelphogor may (I feare me) claime as many followers and fautors in our age, as either he had in Persia, Rome, or Media: for our bankets excéed nature, and where our fathers were content with bread and water, which at first nourished mans life after the creation of the world: now neither the fruit of trées, nor the variety of corne, nor the roots of hearbs, nor the fishes ofLib. de

Policrates saith, that the intemperancy of meate subuerteth manners, and preiudizeth mans health: and Hippocrates maintaineth this, that grosse and fat bodies, growen beyond measure, except by letting blood, they be somewhat abated, become numme and insensible, and fall into most dangerous diseases. Chrysostome saith, that excesse of meat consumeth and rotteth

mans body by continuall sicknes, and at last bringeth cruell death. Galen (the interpreter of Hypocrates) saith, That they that are grossesed, can not be long time healthfull: concluding, that those soules can not meditate or conceiue celestiall things, whose bodies are ouergrowen with blood, flesh, and fat. It is reported of Dionysius the tirant, that being too much swallowed vp by surfet and drunkennesse, he lost his eie sight; for there is nothing sooner dulleth the eie, then excesse: because (as Portuminus saith)

                        rat, Gluttony spendeth meat, but deuoureth the eies. Macrobius in his Saturnals, proposeth a very prety and disputable question; namely, whether vniforme and simple meat, be better and easier of digestion, then diuers and different? and to this a certaine Philosopher answereth, that diuers and different meat is the hardest of digestion for these causes: first it appeareth in beasts, which because they féed on a simple and pure nutriment, are most helthfull; and if any of them be diseased, it is when by variety of medicine and mans folly, they are nourished against the course of their nature: secondly, because all simple meat is more easily digested, in signe whereof, euery Phisitian recouereth and ministreth to his patient in one kind of food, that nature may more easily conuert the simple meat into her selfe: thirdly, because as the variety of wine, hurteth more then one sort of wine in the same quantity, in like sort doth the variety of meat: fourthly, because he that obserueth one kind of simple diet, may more easily iudge and gesse at the cause of his infirmitie (if at any time he féele himselfe distempered) and consequently can more easily auoid such kind of food: whereas if hée should haue vsed diuers, he should vtterly be ignorant, to which of many he should impute the cause of his sicknesse: fistly, because in the stomacke, the nature of diuers meats is very different, therefore (nature working vniformitie for her owne part) certaine are sooner digested then other, (the rest remaining in the stomacke being crude) and consequently that r

                  ts which is afterwards to be digested: by which reasons it followeth, that these rich men vsing diuers kind of dishes, do by that means shorten their owne liues. But perhaps to particularize diseases will be held more

forcible argumenes, I will therefore tell you what infirmities surfet bréedeth. First (as Auicen saith) it hindreth the braine, the liuer, and the nerues, it causeth conuulsions, sowndings, Epilepsies, the falling sicknesse, and the palsey: it ingenders the lamenesse in the legges, the gout, the Sciatica, the Apoplexie, and a thousand defluxions, cathars, and crudities of the stomacke, which procéed from nought els, but from the insatiable desire of drinking and eating. All philosophie will confesse vnto me, that the more a man stuffes and chargeth his stomacke, the more he gréeueth it; for first of all it is necessary that he surmount and excéed the nutriment and meat, and digest it also; and in the surmounting he must striue, and in striuing he wearieth himselfe, and in wearying himselfe he waxeth féeble, and in waxing féeble he finally consumeth, and then his cooke (I meane his stomacke) vnable to worke or boile, it followeth of necessity that he must die. But leaue we this to Phisitians to decide, and like Christians let vs learne to say with Seneca (though a Pagan) 
                     Maius sum, & ad maiora natus sum, quam vt fiam mancipium corporis mei, I am greater, and borne to greater things, then to become the bondslaue of mine owne body. Briefly, (since according to Augustine) Gluttony marcheth neuerLib. 4. de b

                  INdustrious Labour, that hast thus long kept me from Idlenesse, guiding the sailes of my conceit through the Seas of reason; now helpe to arange my squadrons, to describe & confound him: lead me a path vntracted by courser spirits, that I may beare downe enuy by desert, & puzle detraction in his deprauing knowledge. It is not vnknowen to men of reading, how Astaroth after hée had receiued many sacrifices by the Israelites (as appeareth in the booke of Iudges) and perswaded Salomon (the wisest of Kings) in his old and retired yéeres to build him an Altar, was (by the praiers and perswasions of many Prophets) at last banished from the chosen nations: so that enforced to liue in exile, he ranged vp and downe Media, Persia, and Arinenia, and at last spred his renowme in Rome: whence banished by the busie affaires of Princes from their Courts, and from other places of Spaine, France, and Italy; he at last retired himselfe to the Northren parts: Amongst whom finding contentions in the Clergie, and affectation of glory and armes in Prince and subiect; he tooke his Idle wings and flew to the Southerne and lately discouered land, where honoured by the Brasilians, that greatly delighted in Idlenes, he hath yet a sufficient segniory and dominion to maintaine himselfe: Yet willing that the Ciuill world (which hée deadly hateth) should be infected with his humor, he hath lately vpon an Indian Negro be gotten fiue sonnes at one clap: and (the sooner to practise his mallice) hath procured their abortion and vntimely birth, to the end they might with the more spéed be sent into Europe. The first is, Desperation, the second Pusillanimity, the third Dulnesse of the spirit, the fourth Negligence, the

for, he shipt in a Brasile man for Ciuill, but the ship being vnfortunately taken by an English man, they were brought into England, and no sooner set foot on land, but ran away from their Captaine. Now sir, hauing all languages perfectly, they follow strange directions, not tying their spirits to one determinate body, but flying here and there, and infecting all places, and exempting themselues from no persons: yet as subtill as they are, I haue sounded them out; and that I know them, I will resolue you if you please to read their descriptions. The eldest of them Desperation (a peculiar vice procéeding frō 
                  Idlenes, but not y• which is the sin against the Holy-ghost,) is such a sin, that if he méet wt a rich man, he makes him distrust himselfe for getting vp on his horse without helpe; he causeth him forbeare the reading of bookes in suspect of his vnderstanding, he driues him to be dainty of his meats, telling him his stomack is squeasie; he féedeth him in his dreams with terrible visions, he driues him to mistrust himselfe in whatsoeuer he pretendeth, inforcing such a diffidence in himselfe, that both he maketh him an enemy to his body, and the ruine of his owne soule. He perswades the Merchant not to traffique, because it is giuen him in his natiuity to haue losse by sea; and not to lend, least he neuer receiue againe. He makes the Scholler loath to read bookes if they be long, carelesse to heare lectures, because he vnderstands not at the first. He causeth a louer to lie sighing in his bed, and rather die sicke of the sullens then tell his griefe. The poore man he teacheth to curse his birth, and desperately to giue ouer labour, where otherwise if he would shew diligence, he might be relieued. He tels a Lady it is best kéeping her bed, when the Phisitians assure her the disease is cured with exercise: and let him but light on a séeble heart, he will die first before he take a medicine. If a friend intreateth his friend to speake in his behalfe, out steps he, and counsels him to forbeare the demand, for feare he be denied: and if a husband man haue a good crop, in the midst of his haruest hée teacheth him this tetch of vnthankefulnesse, I would I were a beast, so I were rid of this trouble. How say you by this spirit of darkenesse? Is hee not cunning and subtill? Are not his treasons coloured

and plausible? Is not his perswasion conformable to weake nature? If you say nay, you erre; if you confesse it, then learne thus to preuent him: First, remember that 
                     Volenti nihil difficile, A good will winneth all things: and to condemne our owne abilitie in good things, is to suspect Gods mercifull prouidence in furtherance of iustice and vertue: obserue that lesson in Seneca,
                  
                     Qui nihil potest sperare, desperet nihil.
                     Who nothing hopes, let him despaire in nought.
                  

Let the rich know this, that he that feareth a litle frost of infirmity, shall haue a great snow fall vpon him: let him consider, that to helpe nature, winneth ease; and that to endeauour willingly, is halfe the meane to attaine happily: let him remember this, that God openeth the vnderstanding, if we offer the endeauour; and commanding vs temperance, killeth the feare of ercesse; and being all in all things, is defectiue in nothing that is vertuous. Let the superstitious Merchant trust the creator, and he shall not superstitiously be tied to creatures; and succour his neighbours necessities with good intent, and God shall

                  eward him. Let the scholler know, that the harder he is to conceiue, the surer he is to retaine: and as no way is too long to him that séeketh a place desired; so no booke can be too tedious that le

                  s any path to knowledge. Let the poore labour to preuent néed, and he may be assured to find no cause to suspect necessities. Let the Lady fast in continence, she shall not languish in excesse: and let all men build on God, and desperation shall not hurt them. Let vs draw néerer this fiend, and coniure him more cunningly: he hath more motiues in man, & let vs therefore examine them. Saith he, fasting killeth worldly comfort, and therefore it is to be fled. Answer him boldly, that it is transitory, and momentary which delighteth, but eternall that mortifieth. If he say, thy sinnes are great; tell him, Gods mercie is greater: If he induce desperation by thy often fall, oppose Christs words against his suspect,

neither measure the mercies of God, nor define the time: and (to giue a sword vtterly to confound this furie) vse hope, which (though euery waies thou be assaulted) will maintaine thy constancie; And conclude thus (when troubles or doubts distraught thée,) with Ouid,
               
               
                  Magna tamen spes est in bonitate dei,
                  Yet in Gods goodnesse is our hope increast.
               
               The second furie (now adaies ranging vp and downe our countrie, and infecting fraile and inconstant hearts) is Pusailanimitie and Worldlie feare, who (wheresoeuer he lurketh,) is knowne by these tokens; hée maketh the eie inconstant, the colour come and goe, the heart beat, the thought suspitious, he kils weake desire, by suspitious feares; and as a little water (as Aristotle saith) is sooner corrupted then a great deale; so with this abastardizing spirit, the weaker minds are sooner attainted thē the great. This fiend maketh easie thinges impossible by mistrust, and so transporteth affections that they can claime no title in their owne natures. This is a temporall and foolish kind of feare, rising either from the loue of transitorie things, or the supposed difficulties of life. The ordinarie seate of this humor is in the sensualitie of the heart: With this weaknesse of spirit was Anthonie the Romane seasd, who séeing the increases of Caesar, when his meanes of resist were sufficient, retired himselfe to his Timoneum, leauing both Cleopatra and his busines, as destitute of all hope, before the assurance of his danger: mortall is this sinne if it bée accompanied with the consent of the will, the Apostle writing to the Colossians saith, Fathers prouoke not your children vnto indignation, least they become weake in mind, and loose their courage, (according to the Syriak:) noting hereby, that this infirmitie accompanieth for the most part those that are of the weakest abilitie and Iudgement. This deiection of spirit likewise is an effeminate and womanish disease, expressed often by foolish huswifes in those words, Good God what shal I do? How shal I dresse my house? Make ready my children? Doe this, and do that? being things

easie and rediculons to bée forced. Against this infirmitie, and inue noming spirit of feare, I will applie that of Doctor Gerson, where hée sayth, That there are diuers that thinke they offend by dispaire, which offend not: For this procéedeth from a certaine Pusillanunitie of their hearts, or of emotiue or féeling of dispaire, which they estéeme to bée a consent, but it is not. For whatsoeuer féeling they may haue, (yea, although it presse so farre as that they thinke themselues almost attainted with this temptation) they lose not charitie, as long as they are sorrowfull, and the reason is contrarie and consenteth not thereto: So that the spirit of a man is ouercome by the enemie, except there bée consent of the will: For the seuce maketh not the sinne, but the consent. You that are or may happen to bée intangled in these briars, and assailed by this temptation, make your generall recourse to God, saying with the Apostle, 
                     Omnia possum in co qui me

                        : I can doe al things by the grace of him that comforteth mee. To conclude, let no man hide his Talent whatsoeuer, which God hath bestowed on him to trafficke and profite his neighbour, least hée incurre this vice of Pusillanimitie; but let vs all cleaue vnto Magnanimitie his opposite, considering this of Tullies, Qui magno animo est & forti; omnia quae cadore in hominem possunt desp

                  Dulnesse of spirit (the next borne to Pusillanimitie) hath great conformitie with him, for Pusillanimitie hinders the beginning and enterprise of a good worke, and this fiend letteth the performance of it whe it is begun, & maketh a man giue ouer in the midst of his busines. This monster hath thrée heads whersoeuer

he seaseth one body: the first is Idlenesse, (slack to performe any thing, and a poison that confoundeth many men;) the second is Slownesse, that deserreth to follow vertue, or conuersion from sinne: the third is Tepiditie, which causeth a man do his worke coldly, without courage or feruor in his busines. This fiend haunteth most commonly among those sort of men, that are too much subiect to their flesh, and being bondslaues to their sensual lusts, haue their reasons obscured, and their desires dulled: they hate Musike, despise Arts, accounting their excellence to be in ignorance; if they speake, it is so abruptly and lothsomly, as it mooueth not; and if they be silent, they rather looke like some blind statues of marble, then liuing and moouing men. If they write, it is Inuita Minerua, so coldly and without conceit, as they (like the vntunable ring of Bels) rather fill the ears with iarring and noise, then delight or reason. Many & too many are possessed with this spirit, and this spirit is incarnate in them. For they only like beasts respect present things, hauing no care of that which is to come: you shall sée a slouen sléeping in his bed, that for want of rising loseth the commodity of preferment: another so cold in his enterprises, that he is vnfortunate in all busines. Whatsoeuer commeth from such men, séemeth to be enforced, (so is the eie of their iudgements blinded in perceiuing that which best behooueth them.) I knew one of this factiō in Oxford, who (after he had studied seuen yeres, & often beaten ouer the Predicables,) at last thanked God y• he had a litle sight in Genus: This was as slouenly a lout as euer I lookt vpon, who often found in his heart to loose his breakfast for want of fetching: come into his study, you should still sée him sléeping ouer his booke. In all exercises he was alwaies the last: & in all disputations so cold, & duncicall, that neither any man vnderstood him, nor he, himselfe. With this spirit was those two Seruing men seased, the first of which being asked by his master sitting at dinner, what hée had brought from the Sermon? In faith Sir, (said he) your hat and cloake, and nothing els. The second examined in the like manner, answered thus: Faith I markt not the beginning, I was asléepe in the midst, and came away before the end. This is a daungerous fiend wheresoeuer

he gets footing, causing men to make shipwracke of their time, which being short and swift once past is irrecouerable, & which lost (saith Bias and Theophrastus) a great treasure is lost. This made certaine discontented (as Timon and Apermantus) waxePlutarch careles of bodie and soule, fretting themselues at the worlds ingratitude, and giuing ouer all diligent indeuor, to serue the fury of their vnbridled minds. The stories registred by learned men are full of men thus affected, and who so considereth the most pollices and Common weals of Christians, shall I fear me (and let me write it with griefe) find more oportunitie lost by coldnesse, slacknes, and delay, then consideration can remedy with many yeares heart break and studie. By delay and protraction, enemies wax strong, and lingering hate giueth preuention a diligenter eie; and though Affricanus admitteth not officious diligence, yet am I so contrarie to him, that I dare boldly auow, that the most stratagems that are done happily, are done suddainly: yet desire I not to bée misconstrued in this, for before action, I admit counsel, and secresie: But matters once intended, I hold all time lost till they be executed; for delay giueth the enemie oportunitie of intelligence, weakeneth the heart of the souldior, generally more feruent in the first exploits; and afflicteth the heart of the gouernor till the issue be discouered. To conclude, as waters without stirring & mouing, wax corrupt; so without diligence all affaires are either lost or weakened.
               But leaue we this (yet not as impertinent to this place, but as such a thing if well lookt into, deserues a whole volume) and let vs now haue an eie to the next ftend of this bréed, which Sathā first named Negligence. Negligence incarnate in our world, hath generally a running head, he is full of rancor, and replenished with idlenesse; Instability, and Mutabilitie, continually attend vpon him; so that he beginneth many things, but endeth nothing: he will execute no office by reason of trouble, kéepe no house least he take too much care for his family: put him in trust with a message, hée forgets it: and commit your affaires to his handling, all comes to nought: reading good bookes troubles his wits, but for Palmerine, thats a pretrie storie, and why, because it teacheth him no wit: This fiend lets his books bée couered

with dust for want of looking too, his garments fall in pieces for want of amending, his haire ouergrow his shoulders, for want of barbing, his face couered with durt for want of washing, and he walks generally vntrust, not for exercise sake, but for idlenes: he is still thinking and deuising on things, but he executeth nothing, and (like a lunaticke person) runs into strange imaginations, and only speaks them without effecting them: he defers in al that he doth, and thereby loseth the most of his thrift; and in neglecting to sollicite his friends, hée loseth & smothereth his fortunes; so that Occasion may rightly say and crie to him out of Ausonius,

was in danger; Finally, Ionas was cast into the sea, where falling into the belly of a Whale, hée lost his haires of his head,

                  ud became bald. On which place the glosse saith, That the great and heauie sléepe of the Prophet signifieth a man loaden and drowsied in the sléepe of error, for whom, it sufficeth not to flie from our Lord, but furthermore (ouerwhelmed with a certaine carelesnesse) hée is ignorant of Gods wrath and securelie sléepeth, and at last is cast into the Whales bellie, which is the bosome of hell. For as the Whale dwelleth in the déepest flouds, and profoundest seas; so Hell is said to bée in great obscuritie, and in the depth of the earth. Wherevpon in the Gospell it is said, To be in the heart of the earth: For as the heart is in the middest of a creature, so is Hell in the middest of the earth. At the last hée is made bald and spoild of his haire, that is, depriued of his vertues and graces. And where it is said, Ionas sléeping the winds arose; it implieth thus much, that a man sléeping in idlenesse, negligence, and carelesnesse, the winds and stormes of temptations suddainlie and vehementlie arise: For then are wée most suddainlie surprised with error, when wée are most intangled with improuidence and negligence. And as Caesar in his Senate house was assailed when hée least suspected, by his conspirators, so men in their securities are soonest subdued by the assaults of wickednesse; which conspireth the death of the soule. The Poets faine thus of the Syrenes which haunt about Sicily (and of late daies haue appeared in the Sea in India) That with their swéet tunes they draw the Marriners asléepe, that whilest they sléepe soundly, they may sincke their ship. The like may bée said of the Deuill, who lulleth vs in the lap of inconsiderate securitie, and singeth vs asléepe with the notes of Negligence, till he sincke the ship of our soule, which is our bodie, in the bottomlesse seas of confusion, which is Hell.
               Let vs flie from Negligence therefore, as being the first cause of the downefall both of men and Angels, let vs bée forward in curing our corrupt natures, let vs not resemble the foolish bussard in Horace, who because hée could not

                  Somnolence and Sleepinesse lurketh continually with vnfortunate persons, and the excesse thereof sheweth the spirit hath small working: he is a fiend that (wheresoeuer hée inhabiteth) dulleth the sences, maketh the head heauie, the eies swolne, the bloud hote, corrupt, and excessiue, the face pufft, the members vnlustie, the stomacke irkesome, the féet féeble: Looke in a morning when you sée a fellow stretching himselfe at his window, yawing, and starting, there bée assured this Diuell hath some working: This is a shrowd spirit wheresoeuer hée gets seasure, for hée liueth by the expence of life, and hée that entertaines him, hath rhewms, cathars, defluxions, repletions, and opilations, as ordinarilie about him, as euerie substance hath his shadow. This fiend and his brother Negligence are of one nature, and where Duloesle of spirit, and these méet, God, nature, law, counsell, profit, soule, bodie, and all are neglected.
               This considered, let this Deuill incarnate (too ordinarie a guest in this countrie) bée banished from our societie, least being corrupted by his example, wée fall into the same sinne wherewith hée is intangled: for as Plato sayth, 
                     Dormieus est nullius praetis, A sleepie man is of no worth; and in the seuenth of his lawes, hée thus writeth, 
                     Somnus multus, nec animis, nec corporibus▪ nec rebus preclare gerendis, aptus est à natura, Excessiue sleepe is neither good for the soule or bodie, or auailable in any vertuous or laudable action: For hée that sléepeth, is no more accounted of then hée that is dead: and truly I am of this opinion, that hée tooke this custome and law from Homer, and no other, who sayth, That sléepe is the brother of death: The same allusion also vsed Diogenes,
                  
who when he had slept said, 
                     Frater fratem inuisit, The brother hath visited his brother, that is, sléepe hath visited death: the same likewise intimateth Ouid in this verse,

                  Foole what is sleepe but image of chil death?
               
               The like consideration likewise had the Doctors of Israel: so that one amongst them (called Rabi-Dosa the son of Harkinas) writeth, The mornings sléepe, and the euenings dronkennesse, shorten a mans life: corporal sléepe likewise oftentimes ingendreth the sléepe of the soule, which spirituall sléepe is farre more dangerous then the other, and therefore Cato dissuadeth youth from it.
               
                  
                     —Somno ne deditus esto,
                     Nam diuturna quies vitijs alimenta ministrat.
                  
                  
                     Be not addict to sleepe, for daily rest
                     Yeelds food to vice and nurseth sinne in feast.
                  
                  And that diuine Petrarch most wittily singeth,
                  
                     La gola il somno, & Potiose piume,

               So that humane nature is wandred from his scope, and ouercome by euill custome. Thexe is another Poet (as I remember it is Ouid) that saith it is sufficient for children to sléepe seuen houres: and another contemplatiue father saith, that to repose fiue houres, is the life of saints; to sléepe sixe, is the life of men; but to slug seuen, is the life of beasts: Saist thou thus O father? Oh that thou couldest haue liued to haue séene this age, wherein if thy wordes sound truth, thou shouldest find (whatsoeuer way thou séekest) as manie reasonable beasts as there bée motes in the Sunne, thinking eight, tenne, twelue houres, but a Method of Moderation. These are they that sléepe in their beds of Iuorie, and play theAmes 6.

                  Damascene (defining this sinne) saith, That it is a spirituallDamas. lib. 2. Ortho. ca. 14. heauinesse, which depresseth and weigheth downe the soule so much, that it taketh no delight or tast in executing goodnesse. Tully he defines it to be a wearines and tediousnes of the spirit, by which a man groweth in lothing of that good he hath begun. So that by them it is to be gathered that Sloth is a languishing infirmity of the spirit, a dulnes of the mind, a diffidence of Gods helpe, a distrust of our owne strength. The sinnes it maketh those subiect too that are intangled therewith, are forgetfulnes of God, carelesnes of our estates, obscurity of our soules, loathsomnesse of our bodies, and irrecuperable losse of time. This sin (by the Fathers) is compared to the disease (called by the Phisitians) Paralisis, with which, whosoeuer is seased, his members are dissolued▪ his vitall powers and naturall faculties are weakened, and he himselfe is wholly not himselfe, neither being able to mooue, nor master his owne lims. So fareth it by a slothfull man, who looseth by this sicknes the light of his mind, the vse of his vnderstanding, y• good affections that are the props and pillars of the same, and becommeth but the image of that which in effect he is not: and as this infirmity is healed by ver

                  t lie sléeping in his chamber? Consider (father) what the Psalmist saith, Mine eies haue preuented the day; and that of Ambrose, It is vncomely for a Christian that the beame of the Sunne should behold him idle; and let this persuade you to cast off your slugginesse: The Bishop (rowsed with these wordes all in rage) said vnto him, goe wretch as thou art and louse thy selfe, I disdaine thy counsailes: to whom the Moncke answered in a pleasant manner, Take héed father least your wormes kill you, for mine are alreadie slaine: hée meant the worme of conscience, which shall at last bite them, who are giuen ouer to their sensualities. I haue read also a prettie storie in an old dunce called Petrus de Lapiaria, which because of the pithie allusion I will not sticke to tell you. A certaine King (saith hée) hauing thrée sonnes, and being well kept in yeares, resolued to make his Testament, certifying his children, that which of them was most slothfull, on him hee would bestow his kingdome; to whom the first said, to me belongs the kingdome, for I am so sluggish, that as I sit by the fire I rather suffer my shinnes to bée burnt, then to draw them from the flame: the second hée said, the crowne in all reason belongs to mée, since I am farre more slothfull then thou art, for hauing a rope about my necke, and being readie to bee hanged, and a sword in my hand, suficient to cut the same, yet am I so slothfull, that I will not stretch out my hand to saue my life: after him the third stept vp, and in these wordes m

To yéeld this a Morrall interpretation,

these thrée sonnes are thrée sorts of idle persons; The first that cares not for fire, signifieth him, that being in the companie of euill and luxurious men, will not forsake them: The second, (knowing himselfe hanged in the snaro of the Deuill, as the couetous man) yet hauing and knowing the sword of Praier sufficient to cut the rope, neuerlesse hée will not vse it: The third (that will neither turne his eie to the right or to the left hand) signifieth him that neither considereth the paines of Hell, nor the rewards of Heauen, So that neither for feare of punishment, nor hope of reward, hée will rise againe from sinne: On him the Deuill his father (who as Iob saith, is the King euer the children of pride) bestoweth the kingdome of Hell, where no order but continuall horror inhabiteth. And trulie to the iole and slothfull person Hell doth most iustly appertaine, because hauing eies to sée his infirmitie hée blindeth them; a mind to vnderstand his remedie, hée disdaineth it; and times made for labour, yet refuseth it: but as Salomon saith, 
                     Omnis piger in egestate erit, The slothfull man shall liue in pouertie, and Hell iustly shall bée his inheritage that negligently forbeareth to labor for heauen. Oh thou slothfull man if this persuade thée not, looke further; the male storke senteth the adulteries of the female, except shée wash her selfe, doth not God then both sée and will punish thy sinne except thou mend thy selfe? The Lion smelleth the filthinesse of his adulteresse, and will not hée thinke you looke into the offences of his creatures, yet assuredly he that séeth all things beholdeth thy wickednesse, and except thou repent thée, will do iustice on thy negligence.
               Hauing alreadie heard the deformities of this monster, now at the last let vs consider the ren edies against him. First, let vs intentiuely ponder and weigh how much our Sauiour hath laboured and trauailed for the saluation of mankind: It is said that hée past the nights in praier, after whose example if wee desire to bée his, wee must (with the holie Martyrs of the

Primitiue Church) mortifie our earthly members, and follow him in the like exercise: secondly, (in that this sinne of Idlenes hindreth both soule and body, and by that meanes is the occasion of many mischiefes, as well corporall as spiritual.) It hath bene as well detested both in holy scriptures, as in fathers of the Primitiue Church, as appeareth by Iohannes Clymachus, where he saith, Idlenes is a dissolution of the spirit, an abiect feare in all good exercises, an hatred and griefe of any godly profession. He saith likewise that worldly men are happy, he speaketh til of God, accounting him cruell, and without humanity; he maketh a man astonished in heart, and weake in praier; more hard then iron in the seruice of God, & both slothfull and rebellious to trauell with his hands, or to do obedience. Behold the right effects of deuilish Astaroth: consider likewise what fruites spring from this cursed fiend. Thirdly, one of the best meanes to resist the craft of this fiend, is to trauell and to be alwaies doing somewhat, to the end we be not surprized suddenly, as Saint Ierome counselleth. To this purpose, the ancient monks of Egypt, had alwaies these words in their mouthes▪ That heCass lib. 10. cap. 23. which occupieth himselfe in any good exercise, is not tempted by the Deuill; but hée that doth nothing, but liueth Idly, is tormented and possessed with diuers. And if the Heauens, the Sunne, the Moone, and other planets, the birds, beasts, and fishes. are in continuall motion, and without ceasing apply those offices for which they were created; what ought man to do, who is created for trauell, and whose soule is defined by the Philosopher to be a perpetuall motion?

wood, where, for the whole day, he occupied the people in cutting downe the wood, and in continuall toile in lopping the trées. But the next day, he caused very sumptuous feasts to be prepared, & commanded his hoast to feast, sport, and make holy day with gladnes; and going to euery company in the midst of their sports, he asked them which of those two daies best liked them: who answered, that the second was more pleasant then the first. To whom he replied in this sort: As by yesterdaies labor you came togither and were assembled to this daies banquet, so can you not be happy and blessed, till first of all you ouercome the Medes. So (in alluding to this after a morrall meaning) we can not attaine to blessednesse, except we ouercome in this world the Medes, which are the deuils, by vertuous actions; neither can we be admitted to the banket, except by labour in this life time. Agamemnon, Vlysses, and Hercules, the one besieged and raced Troy; the other, subdued and ouercame Polyphemus; the third atchieued twelue incredible labours for glories sake: Let not vs therefore refuse labour for heauens sake. The Angels are not idle, but sing praises; the celestiall bodies (as I say) are not Idle, but obserue their motions; all airie, earthly, and watry creatures, are in continuall exercise: aire is continually tossed by the wind; water continually ebbes and flowes. If therefore all creatures detest Sloth, and imbrace Labour, to giue man example; let vs forsake lothsome Idlenesse, for many foretold and these set down by Ouid:

               As therefore all things ware worse for want of exercise & vse, and study refineth both Arts and all maner knowledge whatsoeuer, let vs detest Astaroth, flée his bréed, tie our selues to exercises both of mind and body, vse the practise of Themistocles, occupy our heads when we walke solitary, and so dispose of all our actions, that the Enemy of all vertue find vs not Idle, who thinketh that fort easily woon, where the watchman sléepeth; & that mind quickly ouercome, that entertaineth Idlenesse. Let vs follow Paul, who wrought with his hands, least he should be troublesome to his brethren. Let exercise neuer forsake vs, either of mind or of body: for the Deuill (as Ierome saith) is like a thiefe, who finding a horse idle in the fields, gets vpon the backe of him, where contrary of those that labour, he can catch no holdfast. Idlenesse (saith Bernard) Est mater nugarum, nouerca virtutum, Is the mother of toies, and the stepdame of vertue: for it casteth the strong man headlong into offence, and choking vertue, nourisheth pride, and squareth out the path to hell. If the castle be vnwalled, the Enemie enters; if the earth be vnmanured, it bringeth forth thornes; if the vine be neglected, it groweth fruitlesse: So if our bodies and mind

                  THus far with regard to profit, & desire to please, I haue drawen my discourse and emploied my readings: what my paine hath béene, you may recompence with your acceptance. For as to the traueller the hope of rest maketh his iourny séeme light; so to the studious, the expectation of

profit and good respect, lesseneth the tediousnesse of labour, and long watchings. It fareth now with me as with shipwrackt sailers that esyie their port, and weary pilgrimes that are in sight of Ierusalem; for my present Ioy drowneth my passed Trauell, and after I haue finished my iourney, I hang vp my offerings at the shrine of your curtesies: If you accept them, it satisfieth my labour, and sheweth your thankfulnesse. I am not of Caius Lucillius opiniō, That no man should read my writings; for I had rather he misinterpreted then thought negligent. Accept my good intent (I pray you) and it shall encourage my endeauour; for a Father saith, The giuing of thankes, is an augmentation of desert. The desire is tedious that hath no end, and the labour loathsome that is misconstrued. You buy that cheape, which cost me deare; and read that with pleasure, which I haue written with trauell: Only if you pay me with the séed of acceptance, you make me forward toward another haruest: and in giuing me thankes, you shall loose nothing. For (as Tully saith) he that giueth it hath it, and he that hath it, in that that he hath, restoreth it. You haue the aduantage of my goods, they are already in your hands: if you pay me that you owe me, I may hap trust you with a greater summe of Science. Farewell, and wish me no worse, then I am carefull to increase thy knowledge.
