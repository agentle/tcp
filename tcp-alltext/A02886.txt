            The Preface.
            
               EVydent is yt (dere frynde in the
Lorde) vnto them which are in
the scripturs exercysed / that
our eternall God for his owne

                  ••
               lye honoure created man at the first / 
and all other creaturs for mannys behoue.
This ones conceyued by fayth in Abell and
Enos / at the preachynges of Adam & Seth
for the first age / prouoked the one to offre vp
sacrifice vnto hi / & the other to call vpon his
most gloryouse name. In this godlye offyce
was Noe founde ryghtouse / Abraham sayth
full / Moses myghtye / Dauid holye / Helias
feruent / and manye other more in their sortes
zelouse for all the other ages. Farre to
longe were yt and tedyouse vnto the readers
to recyte the examples of all the fathers in
that behalfe. Iesus Christ the onlye fulfyller
of all ryghtousnesse / in all his sore trauay
le here / sought the onlye glorye of his heauē
               lye
father / and taught the same lesson aboue
all other to be obserued of his. In the manyfolde
temptacions of sathan in the wildernesse
he paciētlye answered to that was suggested / 
but the presumed dishonour of God
in no case coulde he suffre. The holye Apostles
and manye other Godlye mynysters / 
haue euermore daungered their syues in the
lust quarell of the same. If we than wetyngly
shuld suffre him in this age to be blasphemed / 
all these godlye exāples reiected / we
myght thereby rather apere his enemyes / 

than seruauntes / his haters than louers.
This consyderacion first moued my mynde / 
after that I had seane a thre years ago / an
abhomynable Iest made vndre the tyttle of
a Genealogye of heresye / & by two diuerse
prentes spred abrode amonge the people / to
dysclose the great mysterye of iniquyte thervndre
contayned / and to restore agayne the
peruerted scripturs / with the names of those
Godlye menne which are oblocuted therin.
In this will no man that is godlye be offended / 
but thynke that I haue herin done
my bounde dewtye. Though the compylet
therof by the mercyfull Goodnesse of God
be conuerted to repentaunce (as I am credyblye
infourmed that he is) yet remayneth
his blasphemouse doctryne amonge the cō
               mon
people in a wonderfull nombre of coppyes.
I thought yt therfore mete / not vtterlye
to destroye my labours / but for the abolyshment
of those wycked blasphemyes to
suffre them passe at large. yet I instauntlye
desyre the readers of my boke / not to thynke
anye thynge therin spoken agaynst him / 
which is now becommen Gods seruaunte / 
but agaynst that olde pestysent Papyst Pantolabus
which styll yet blasphemeth Christ
and his most faythfull wytnesses. Him wolde
I not haue them to space / so longe as he
dwesseth on the earthe / and that is that prodygyouse
Iest or Generacyon of heresye.
Vnsemelye were yt / so manye swete scripturs

to remayne so depraued / and so manye
Godlye menne so slaunderouslye reported / 
the veryte in them both so spyghtfullye abused / 
for his names sake which hath wrought
wyckedlye. Though Adam recanted his errour / 
and Dauid his wycked workinges / Peter
his denyall of Christ / and Paule his tyrannouse
turmoylynges / yet are they not
hydden in the scripturs / but made fiyll open
to all the worlde / in re
                  •
               uke and warninge
vnto vs of soche execrable euyls. Neuer y•
lesse yet those vyces so rebuked / are now vnto
them no rebuke / but a syngular prayse rather
where as they are rehersed / beige wholle
remitted in Christ. The great synne of Adam
which is the onlye grounde of deathe
in all mē is yet euerye yeare proclamed happye / 
amōge the Paschall ceremonyes. Whā
Christ leaneth his churche vnrebuked and
vntrobled forsynne / than rouneth she a straye
by manye s
                  •
               r
                  •
               unge and vncommaunded
worshyppinges. Than reygneth she commō
               lye
in a wycked peace / and abhominablye
playeth the whore abusynge her selfe in the
cowche of Iesabel. Apoca. 2. as of longe tyme
hath done the Romyshe Synagoge. And
so becommeth she no longer his chosen spouse / 
but a reproued congregacion. Moche more
honoure is ours / whan our synnes are rebuked
by the scripturs / than whan the scripturs
remayne by vs reproued and slaundered.
Amonge the prophane Phylosophers &

Poetes / was euer the verite had in honoure / 
and preferred farre aboue all fleshlye amyte.
Moche more than ought it so to be vsed
amonge vs which are of the Christē scole.
The rebukes of this boke / wayeth vpon
the matter and not the man / the spyghtfull
blasphemer & not the godlye recanter. That
his fylthye vomete is proued here abhomynacion
by the scripturs / to the intent that
people shuld detest it and not therwith be
poysened / can be vnto his name no derogacion
but rather a lawde amonge them that
are godlye wyse. Verye vncomlye were it / 
that fylthynesse shuld haue fauer / and so be
cowche
                  •
                vp as a precyouse treasure / amonge
menne of Christen honeste. Rather is it
mete / that it were throwne fourth / & so manifesilye
knowne for that it is / euen verye
fylthynesse in dede. I haue no doubt therof / 
but. I. 
                  •
               . becomminge the seruaunt of God
vtterlye nowe detesteth that fowle Papyst
Pantolabꝰ that Romyshe rybalde / that ryotouse
rayser with all his prodigiouse Poesyes
and wolde haue him rather bayted awaye
withe botchers dogges / than anye
longar to wayte vpon him. Full glad are
we to heare it / that frō Sodome he is lately
departed / leauige that beast there behinde
him to receyue the lordes double plage / and
that his selfe nowe trauayleth (I trust) towardes
the mounte of sauegarde. That he
is becomen of a wolfe a lambe / of a Saule a

Paule / and of a spyghtfull persecuter a godlye
Christen preacher / it is vnto vs no smal
reioyce. We lawde that heauenlye lorde / 
which thus of mere pytie and mercye hath
founde out his almost peryshed shepe / layed
him vpon his shulders / and brought him ageyne
to his folde. If he styll perseuer accordinge
to his callinge. Heshall become of a
forener a cytezen with the Sayntes / and a
glouryouse partyner with Christ in his eternall
heritage. He shall also haue for his lust
labours in the lordes vyneyarde here / besydes
his penye wages his peculyar prayse
in the sanctyfyed congregacyon of the
ryghtouse. The eternall father & lorde
Iesꝰ Christ indue so wt his sprete
both him & vs / that we maye
vnto the ende perseuer faithfull / 
to the counfort of
his electes. Amen.

of heresye.
                     2 Compyled by Ponce Pantolabus
                  
¶The openinge.
               
                  O Therwyse can I not coni
                     •
                  cture of Pantolabus / 
but that he hath put forth these
preciouse poesyes of some sett purpose / 
eyther to be seane a famouse poete / or els to
apere a mightye vpholder of the Popes holye
churche. But yf he thinketh herin to haue mynistered
vnto hys natiue region of Englande
a doctrine of christen religion / he wonderfullye
deceyueth himselfe. What they wyl s
                     •
                  me
to be by the towche stone of Gods worde / the
sequele of this boke shall declare. I thinke nō
other than the verye doctrine of deuyls / y• lyes
of a popyshe hypocrite / the errours of a cruell
Antichrist / the fylthye drinke of the whores
cuppe of Babylon / and the stinkynge frutes of
the bo
                     •
                  tomlesse pytt. Expende first of all the
tyttle of his tragedye / which ys / the Genealogye
of heresye / and ye shall fynde in yt small

goodnesse I suppose. Saint Paule ernestlye
admonished his derelye beloued disciples Tymothe
and Tytus in anye wyse to shurne Genealogyes
and fables as thinges most super
                  
                     •
                  luouse
and vayne.
               2 Panotlabus as one of a contrarye sprete
and iudgement hath not onelye taken this for
bydden office vpon him / but also vsed yt here
in a moche worse kynde. For there is yt spoken
concerninge. Iudaysme or vnnecessarye doubtes
in Moyses lawe. Here doth he vsurpe yt
in blasphemouse raylinges and vnshamefast
lyes ageynst them whose lyues were moste innocent
and godlye. He sheweth himselfe therfor
in this not onlye a spyghtfull aduersarye
vnto Paules lerning / but also a cruell enemye
both to Christ & his kynge / mynistrynge vnto
that people soche doctrine of deuilyshnesse / 
of whome the one is the head the other his depute / 
in that he is vndre him a christen gouernour.
Of this vnwholsom tyttle is yt easye to
iudge / what the frutes are thervpon folowynge.
Lete the Reader therfore marke them / and
beware of those false Apostles whiche brynge
them soche messages of myschefe. The Genealogye
of Pantalabus now foloweth in course.
            
            
               
                  
                     A mysterye.

Malicia eorum excecauit eos. Sap. 2.
                  
¶The openinge.
               A Monstruouse beginninge hath this Genealogye
declarynge at the first flushe
both the mōstruouse hart of the author / &
also the monstruouse nature of that malignaunt
churche of Anticrist / of whom he is a professed
membre. Non other frute can the yll tre
rendre / I se wele / than his owne frowarde nature
permitteth hi. For nought is yt not that
manye excellent writers in discribinge Anticristis
kyngedome / hath called yt a false / fylthye / 
fleshlye / whoryshe / preposterouse / prostybulouse / 
promiscuouse / and abhominable generacion.
Here is the childe sayd to begett his father / 
or the sonnes childe his grandefather / 
& all in y• femynine gendre. Wherfor yt is lyke
to be a straūge hindred by that tyme that it be
al brought forth. For here is blinde obstinacie
reported to beget heresye / & yet was heresye
manye years in the world before him. Non cā
                  be
obstynate in errour before he doth erre / nor
wilfullye resyst y• verite before he doth hate it.
               2 Rather shuld heresye therfore seme to
brynge forth obstinacye / than obstinacye to engendre
heresye. For after the vocabulystes
Tortellius / Valla / Perottꝰ / Polycattus / Crestonus / 
Calepinus / Guarinꝰ / & soche other vocabulystes:
heresis / is not els but a choyse / opiniō / 
or secte. Not moche vnlyke vnto this doth
Saynt Luke vse yt in the actes / and Saynt
Paule also declaringe himselfe there a pharyse.

Be it ones cowpled withean obstinate frowardnesse
or a wylfull resistaunce of the open
verite / no longar is it an heresye / but an obstinacye / 
rebellion / or diuisyon. Thus doth the
scripture call the aduersaryes of Gods truthe

                     •
                  on heretiques / but false prophetes / sewde apostles / 
deceitful teachers / and Anticristes.
Therfore goeth Pantolabus vnlernedlye to
worke in his Generacion of heresye. Rather
shuld he haue begōne at the denyll which first
begate darkenesse / and so haue gone forth frō
darkenesse to ignoraunce / and from ignoraunce
to errour / with his bretherne in the captiuite
of Babylon. Or els frō Anticrist to auarice
frō auarice to symonye / & frō symonye to heresye
in that veyne. And in so doynge / he myght
at the las
                     •
                   haue founde out his owne stinkynge
sodomitycall generacion.
               3 If this course had not pleased him for y•
obseruacion of his meters / because he is a poete
lorrel / he might haue taken this waye with
him. The false generacion. Of the popishe nacion.
Begonne by the deuyll. The grounder of
euyll. Of enuye and hate. The deuyll first begate / 
The subtyle serpēt / Or worme pestilent
The serpent by Cayne / Gote the kyndered
vayne / Of bretherne vntrewe / That gods seruauntes
slewe. And so forth with the carnall
chyldren of 
                     〈◊〉

magus / Bariehu / Diotrephes / with their successours
the Pope and his college of cardinalles / 
with his smered swarme of shauelynges
both pylled & pye pecked. But this sort he cowde
not fynde out / his eye syght is so yll on that
syde. If blynde obstinacte were not his father
I maruele / so moche lyght of the veryte being
a brode and heretayninge so lyttle. I dare boldelye
saye he was his leader & his great prouoker

                     •
                  ohā he made this worke. I thinke al discrete
readers will haue y• same opinion of him
in that point that I haue here. Iugde thā whether
he be out of his own Genealogye or naye.
               4 Dame ignoraunce whom he here verefyeth
to be y• mother of heresye / shuld seme to haue
a great stroke in him / all circūstaūces marked / 
to make vp the generacion towardes him.
The myschaunce wherof / though it be not perseyued
of him for wāte of grace / yet is it knowne
vnto vs by the frutes here. For neuer had
we known what Pantolabusis / had not these
poesyes declared him. All contrarye is he in
opynion to the auncient doctours / yf he thinketh
that the olde heretiques were ignoraunt
& vnlerned. Saint Hierome reporteth of Tacianus / 
that he famouslye taught the art of
rhetoryck / and that he also wrote innumerable
workes. Marcellus was excedinge wittye / 
and Sabinus was naturallye eloquent.

vpon the scripturs. What Iustinus saith

who cawsed kynge herolde to be slayne / kynge

No trulye. For yf they were / the kynges laws

               3 This semeth Pantolabus to conferme in

so vtter it. Debate / (saith he) and ambiciō begate
supersticion. And he telleth the truthe of
it / though it be sumwhat vnlernedlye for lacke
of godlye iudgement. For in dede after the

Than mustred they in their myters / they

of spirituall wickednesse in the stede of heauenlye
thynges / as Saint Paule doth call it / 
that they might sogloriouslye gouerne here in

of babylon with his mangye māgled meters.
For here one of thē halteth on y• one
syde lyke a greye / being a syllabe shorter than

his fellawe. It is no maruele therfor though
his name be slowthe / for in dede he commeth
but slowlye after. Supersticion (ye saye begate
disdayne. And it maye welebe: for rather are
his frutes afore rehersed of disdayne / than of
loue / of hate than of fauer / of malyce than of
pyte. And in dede the scripture sayth they are

and withs
                     •
                  andinge the helthe of the people.
But surelye supersticion hath more children
thā disdayne / yf Pantolabꝰ loke wele abought
him. Hypocresye which brought forthe latten
houres / longe prayers without deuocion / letanies / 
frydaye fastinges / owr ladies psalters / 
monkes / chanōs / fryres / nonnes / ankers / hermites /

wepiges / crowchinges / knelynges / gaddinges / 
and soche other beggeryes els / shuld
seme to be one of them. So shuld blasphemye
also with all his abhominable of springe.
               2 What disdayne this shuld be / he declareth
folowinglye / callynge it disdayne of trouthe
and the father of slouthe. This contēpt of
godlynesse and verite sprange vp first in Cain
and increased in the carnall children of mēne.
And though it were in processe of tyme destroied
in the generall flood / yet rose it vp ageyne
after the dayes of No
                     •
                   in Cham / and so grewe
forth styll in Nemroth / Ismael / & in their wycked
sede. After this had it continuaunce in the
false prophetes and Idolatrouse prestes of
Baal / in the Pharysees / Scribes / Bisshoppes

and heretyques / tyll the pope toke holde of it.
Euer sens hath it bene gloryouslye mainteyned
of his anoynted clergye / with churches / 
minsters / monasteryes / couentes / cloysters / 
colleges / vniuersytees / prīces lawes / swerde
fyre / & halter. Whiche gloriouse habytacions
hath pampred vp fatt foggye monkes / proude
porkyshe prestes / great bellyed bysshoppes / as
brockyshe bores in a swynes flye / in all bodylye
ease of slouthfull sluggyshnesse / Idelnesse / 
lechery / and beasilynesse / there wallowynge
in Sodome and Gomorre. But trulye I thī
                  ke
it a great ouersyght of Pantolabus / that he
here forgate scolasticall diuinite / which made
the Pope Gods vicar / the head of the churche
and the keye berer of purgatorye to lete out &
in at his pleasure / for it hath also rysen of disdayne
of the truthe.
               3 Of a lykelyhode wylfulnesse had .ii. fathers / 
not all vnlyke to bishoppes bastardes / 
& to the popishe prestes children
                     •
                   Which hath
one father that beareth the name / & an other
that toke paynes to begett him. For here are
slouthe & slughyshnesse both named to be his
fathers. But doubtlesse the right hayres are
not here remembred / nor yet they that styll occupye
their landes. And that are all puffed vp
prelates / with persones / vicars / and curates.
And hardelye lete not syr hugh holye water
swynger be forgotten amonge thē. The throwinge
a syde of the sacred scripturs / and the
false deceyuinge of the poore laboringe manne / 

shuld seme also to be twygges of the same
braunche and sprayes of the same sprygge / yea
and to be sumwhat afore wylfulnesse in this
generacion. And therfore Pantolabꝰ is but a

                     •
                  ole / and foloweth to moche the counsell of dame
ignoraūce in the descripciō of this Genealogie / 
or els he is a parciall frinde to wylfulnesse.
And I thinke that be the verie cause in
dede. This sure holde also he hath vpon his
syde / that painters / poetes / and Rome tōners
maye lye by auciorite.
               4 The text whiche he hathe torne out of
Salomons prouerbes / vult et non vult piger / 
proueth nothinge to the purpose that sluggishnesse
and slouthe begate wylfulnesse. More
honeste were it for him that dame ignoraunce
were farder of from his elbowe / whan he shall
sett his handes to the scripturs. Sathan in y•
desert neuer bestowed Angelis suis Deus mā
dauit dete more vnclarkelye / than this text
is here bestowed. Salomons mynde is / that y•
sluggarde wold fayne haue / but it cometh not
so vnto him / where as the diligent labourer is
habundauntlye suffysed. For thus standeth y•
text after the truer translacion. Concupiscit
anima pigri / et non est ei quod optat. But as
the sainge is / the full fedde sowe seketh myre / 
the vyle vermine corrupcion / as Pantolabus
hath done here the corrupt translacion for his
purpose. And yet will it not serue for slouthe to
beget wilfulnesse / though he turne it .xxiiii.
wayes / as fryre martyn ded his desardes hart

Wonderfullye now a dayes are the scripturs
handeled in Englande / yet are there non heretyques
on that syde of the waye. For how can
a papist be an heretyque to his hinderaunce / 
whan papistes weare styll myters and robes.
It foloweth in the same chapter. Astutus omnia
agir cum consilio / qui autem factuꝰ est / aperit
stulticiam. A wyse manne doth all with
discressiō but a foole declareth his folye. But
this coude not Pantolabus fynde out / wt other
godlye coūsels there mēcioned. Wherfore his
part here after is lyke to be sumwhat y• worse.

to wandre. yet will he styll forewarde with

he hath preferred here in his Genealogye to

acquayntaunce) beynge nigh cosyne to

vnto me / that Pantolabꝰ is not verie wele seane
in genealogyes / or els he daunseth withe
Iacke of Bedlem a voluntarye rounde or a galearde
at his pleasure. For here he calleth heresye
cosyne to wylfulnesse / and yet he is .vi.
degrees afore him. yea / and to make his owne
asynishe rudenesse more manifest therin / he
calleth him here his nigh cosyne. Trulye this
is to folyshe to haue yt scripturs coupled withe
it / yf Boner and Wynchestre with other holye
fathers wynke not vpon it whā they honte for
heretyques. But parauenture he doth it here
that wylfulnesse shuld be known to be all one

here / yf the abhominable peruertige of Gods

                   we rede of. I can not tell what euill
sprete hath taught Pantolabus to be a slaū
                  derouse
accuser of his brother / vnlesse it were
he that accused Iob. And as concerninge
the inwarde manne / he was a sonne of
God / lyke as all they are by his heauenlye
gyft that beleue in his name. For non can
protest that Iesus is the Lorde God / as he
ded most constauntlye ageynst the whole regne
of Anticrist / but in the holye ghost. For
so moche as raylinge Pantolabꝰ falselye reporteth
of Iohan Wyclef without auctorite
that he brought in his grandefather synne / 
I am enforced to answer in his behalfe by y•
auctorite of soche notable writers as I haue
seane and redde.
               Iohan Wyclef beynge an Englyshe mā
                  ne
borne / and a doctor of diuinite / aboute y•
year of owr Lorde a .M.CCC. and .lx. redde
the common lecture at oxforde / and so cō
                  tynued
many yeares after. And as cōcerninge
his eloquence / witt / manyfolde lerninge
and most innocent lyfe / Philippus repingedon
Bysshop of Lyncolne / Nicolaus herforde

O tho Brunfelsius hath in most ample forme
described them / besides the large witnesse
of his enemies / as of Iohan kyuyngham / 

Thomas Walden / and soche other. yea / soche
tyme as Wyllyā Thorpe in his examinacion
reported him to be a manne of most
christen sobryete / conforminge his lyfe and
lerninge to the doctrine of Christ and the
lyuinge of his Apostles. Thomas Arondell
than Archebysshop of Canterberye / beinge
both an aduersarye to him and to the verite
that he had taught / affermed him with his
owne mouthe to be a great clarke and a perfight
lyuer. The stomake that he bare ageīst
him was for his doctrine. For that (he sayd)
was▪ not agreable to the lawes of holye churche.
And yet he graunteth afore that it was
agreable to Christ and to his Apostles. He
coude not awaye in dede with their popishe
tradicions / but called them the fylthye frutes
of Anticrist. He sayd he wolde no longar
aparell the Asse that Christ shuld ryde vpō
with their vayne rytes and ceremonies / but
folowe the clere doctrine of his Sauer Iesus / 
which glorified in heauē / hath nede of
no soche Idell offices to be done to him.
               kynge Edwarde the thirde sumwhat fauored
him for his godlye giftis / as I haue
sufficientlye to proue it. So ded kinge Rycharde
the seconde as he durst preuylye / wt
afterwarde cost him his lyfe. In this beleue
Iohan Wyclef contynued / and was person
of Lutterworth in lyncolne shere. And in the
year of owr lorde a .M.CCC.lxxxvii. this
true Apostle of Christ most constantlye and

cristenlye departed from this worlde commēdinge
his sowle into the handes of God.
His workes were wonderful and manye / as
I intende to declare God lendinge me lyfe
in an other worke. Of whom Subinco lepus
than Bysshop of Prage / brent more than .ii.
hondreth great volumes fayre written / as
witnesseth Eneas Siluius in his boke de
origine Bohemorum. The .xli. yeare after
his deathe / which was the year from Christes
incarnaciō a M.CCCC. and .xxviii.
by a cruell decree from the generall counsell
of Cōstance / were his bones taken vp ageyne
and brent by the clergye of Englande / as
testifieth Walden in lib. de sacramentalibꝰ
Cap. 89. et fo. 199. to make foles afrayed. Nō
hath condempned this wyclef for an heretyque / 
but the Pope and his sworne soudiours
whose cause / matter / and quarell Pantolabꝰ
hath here taken vpō him to defende / though
it be with a small faythe to God & his Prince / 
and moche lesse honeste to his owne preciouse
persone.
               4 As touchinge his allegacion out of Iohans
first Epistle. Qui facit peccatum exdiabolo

Wyclef. The deuyll his master (of whom it
is there spoken) might haue vttered

(sayth the text) is of the deuill. For the
deuill styll synneth after his olde wō
                  
                     •
                  e and
can do non other. I maruele of Pantolabus

that he coude thus with this clause blaspheme
his dead brother in the handes of God / 
without all godlye feare / & thinke not therin
to synne. If he had marked the argumēt
of that chapter wele / he shuld haue founde
in it Gods singular loue towardes vs / to
that ende that we shuld loue here one an other.
And not to condempne by name or to
make raylinge rymes of him bycause the Pope
hath condempned him afore. For by non
other auctorite is Wyclef condēpned. Who
securses God doth blesse / and ageyne doth
curse his blessinges. Lete Pantolabus
therfor be ware. For though he hath nowe
both his good lorde of Wynchesters blessynge
and the Popes / he maye chaunce yet to
dwell vndre Gods curse.
               I Wondre that the Bysshppes so narrowlye
serchinge for heretiq̄s / cā not here smell
out both an heretique and a traytour. Happlye
thei are so vsed to that sauer out of their
owne bosomes / that thei knowe not the one
from the other. But maye saye. Thu and I
are both one mannis children. Saye wele
by me / and I shall do as moche forthe. By
this text folowinge is Wyclef discharged
of that Pantolabus layeth to him. Qui natus
est ex deo / peccatum non facit / quoniāsemen
ipsius in Deo manet. He that is borne
of God (as Iohan Wyclef was receyuynge
Christes doctrine in faythe) synneth not / 
he folowing that doctrine in his lyfe though

he doth despyse all the Popes tradicions / as
he ded also. For the sede of God which is
his eternall worde remayninge styll in him / 
wyll not permyt hī to synne by no soche blasphemouse
popetrye. Thys strayght waye hauinge

               EVermore doth pantolabꝰ pranke forth
with his pylde Popyshe Poesyes not
vnlyke Iacke of Bedlem with his net
full of wolle. From that bryer hath he gathered
that lock all tarrye / and from that thorne
that patche all dryseled. Lete him that
hath eyther lerninge or witt / marke what
dyrtye gete this is / and from what good authors

borrowed. The grounde therof was
first taken out of Pope Benedyct the .xiii. pope
Gregorye the .xii. and Pope Iohan the
.xxiii. all thre deposed at ones in the generall
counsell of Cōstance / & out of the cowyshe
actes and proclamacyons of Pope Martyne
the fift which after supplied their rome
there vpon the seate of the beast in the darke
kyngedom of Anticrist or the chayre of pestylence
whether ye wyll. Here is the name
of a brother most scornefullye vsed / whiche
is in the scripturs both holye and preciouse
And no maruele. For crist sayd there shuld
come soche swyne as wolde treade the fayre
pearles vndre their fete / and soche dogges
also as wolde turne ageyne & teare his true
disciples. The chefe cause of it is / that his
hipocrites eyes can abyde no light. But lete
him not thinke so to auoyde the great indignacion
of God / nor yet anye other soche scorner
as he is.
               2 Iohan Husse that holye Apostle and
true Martyr of Iesus Christ / moche pyteynge
to se y• churche so wretchedlye deformed
with hypocresye / pryde / Idolatrye / & other
abhominaciōs of Anticrist / after he had sum
what perseyued therof by the doctrine of Iohan
Wyclef / put forth his owne bodye to y•
crosse for it / to suffre the death yf nede shuld
require it. The pure lawe of the Gospell wa
                     •
                  
the scripturs of both testamētes ded he most
constantlye preache to the pople of Boheme

ageynst that kyngdom of wyckednesse / detestinge
all errours / heresyes / & scysmes. His
conuersacion was accordinge to his instruccyons / 
perfight and holye. Not onlye by the
report of .liiii. noble menne of the lande of
Morania / but also by the testimonye of his
enemyes / Pope Pius otherwyse called E
                     •
                  e
as Siluius / Pogius the Florentyne / Platina / 
Sabellicus / and soche other. In the opē
counsell of Constance spared not he to confesse
y• true fayth of his Lorde Iesus Christ
to the deathe / and was at the last condempned
thervnto at the suggestions of the Dominick
fryres & other vnlerned sophisters.
He sayd that it behoued the Bysshoppes &
clergie to be poore after the exāple of christ
and not so to fyue in pryde an
                     •
                   voluptuousnesse.
And this was the onlye artycle wherfor
he was brent there to ashes / though the
papistes hath practised other.
               3 What Pantolabꝰ meaneth by that cū
                  panye
of his which begāne in Germanye / I
can not tell / vnlesse they be the Hussytes as
the wytlesse Papistes doth call them. I knowe
wele that both the Apostles and Prophetes
were of that opinion / yet were they no
Germanes borne. Nomore dishonour is it to
the most worihye lande of Germanye to bescornefullie
dispraysed of pantolabus / than
it is vnto golde to be bespryncled with swynes
dyrt. Consideringe that after the mynde
of Seneca it is so fylthye a thinge to be
cōmēded of him that is vyle / as to be cōmended

for fylthynesse. But this maketh me greatlye
to wondre. That so manye heretiques
beynge afore this tyme / as were Hebion / Cerinthus / 
Carpocras / Marcion / Basilides / 
Arrius / Cerdo / Pelagius / Eunomius / Nestoriꝰ / 
Dioscorꝰ / E
                     •
                  tices / Sabinꝰ / Faustꝰ / 
Donatꝰ / Heluidiꝰ / Manes / Montanꝰ / Nouatꝰ / 
Porphiriꝰ / Petulianꝰ / Sabelliꝰ / Sergius / 
Simachꝰ / Vigilanciꝰ / Valens / Macedoniꝰ / 
Artemon / Symon Magꝰ / & a great nā
                  bre
besydes / which were heretyques indede
blasphemige the godhede & diuinite of crist
besydes his humanite & deathe / yet is there
not one of them in all this Genealogie.
               The cause parauēture whye he towcheth
them not is this. They were for y• more part
Bysshoppes & great Prelates / whose quarel
he hath here takē vpon him to defende & not
so to blemishe. There were in the olde lawe
yll sectes / as Pharisees / Saducees / Herodyanes / 
& Samaritanes. And in the new law
also Saracenes / Turkes / Iewes / & Iacobynes.
There hath bene Popes which hath bene
poyseners / Byshoppes that hath bē bawdes / 
Prests that hath ben trayters / fryres / 
monkes / & chanōs which hath bene hypocrites / 
so
                     •
                  cerers / & sodomites / & that in a wonderful
nōbre / yet is there not one regestred
in all this generacion of heresye. Not one
heretyque is yet here named / but poore Iohan
Wyclef & Iohan Husse / of all the heretiques
that hath bene sens christes ascensiō.

And they are here regestred because they were
the Popes vtter enemies. If anye other
heresyes than that had moued the stomake
of Pantolabus / all the other coude not thus
haue bene left out. But a manne maye smell
the tree by the frute. He that seyth not some
light at this hoole / is wurthye to be blynde
alwayes. It wyll not awaye (they saye) that
is bred by the bone. Full swete vnto them is
that holye father of theirs.
               4 The clause of Hieremye that he hath
here vnto annexed / Hee est gēs que non audiuit
vocem dominisui / is not there writen
in the seconde Chapter. And yf it were / yet
wolde it not serue to proue that Husse and
his cumpanye beganne in Germanye / nor
yet that the Germanes neglected the voice
of God whan they forsoke the Pope. For the
Pope is not their Lorde. But in dede this
text is in that Chapter. Tenentes legem / 
nescierunt me. They which haue the lawe
in their handes knoweth me not. They haue
walked after their owne fantasies / & are
now become all vayne. They haue defyled
my pleasaunt lande (sayth the Lorde) & turned
myne heretage into abhominaciō. The
prestes haue dishonoured me / and the preachers
haue done their homage vnto Baall.
They haue forsaken me the well of lyuinge
water / and dygged them broken pyttes that
wyll holde no moystre. They haue called y•
stocke their father / and the stone their creator.

They haue stayned my wayes with blasphemie / 
thei haue taught their owne malycyouse
mischefe / and vpon their winges is
founde the blood of innocēt sowles. All this
with moche more is in that seconde chapter
of Hieremie / yet coude it not serue the purpose
of Pantolabus / but he must brynge forth
a text of his own makinge ageynst the Germanes / 
bycause they haue not obeyed the
Pope.

                     1 And after that.
Came in a gnat.
                     2 Of the same kynde.

               2 Whom Pantolabus meaneth by that
gnatt that shuld be of the same kynde with
Wyclef & Husse / & whom he iudgeth in sowle
to be blinde / we vnderstāde by that which
foloweth here after. It is Mariyne Luther
the verye trompet of this latter age of Christes
Churche / whose bootes to rubbe / & to folowe
him with a wyspe to the Iakes Pantolabus
shuld seme to be more fyt / than eyther
to iudge his lerninge or decerne his faythe.

                  ane a more dodypoll fole and a

more blynde assehead / than he sheweth himselfe
here in these dyrtye Poesyes? He that
iudgeth them not to be the frutes of a sowle
supersticiouse & most wretchedly darkened / 
hath verye small godlye vnderstādinge. If
that sowle be not blinde wt iudgeth whight
to be blacke & vertu to be synne / there is no
sowle blinde in my opinion. Sum tyme was
he rekened for an heretyque that dissented
in opinion from the Gospell & from the speciall
articles of owr Christen faythe. But now
is it nothinge so. For in this whole descripcion
of heresye is not one founde of that hinde / 
as I haue shewed twyse afore. But here
are they noted onlye for heretyques which
hath renounced the Popes obedience. Therfor
it is a newe maner of heresye that is here
set out for menne to be ware of / than was
in those dayes.
               3 God hath at a tyme permitted the false
Prophete to speake that was true. As we
haue for exāple. Balaam the sorcerer / Saul
the disobedient kynge / Cayphas the cruell
Bysshoppe / and Pylate the vnryghtfull iudge.
But he gaue them not with it to vnderstande
that they vttered. Pantolabus hath
here mencioned Martyne Luther to be of
the same kynde that Wyclef and Husse were of.
yet hath he done yt of a wycked sprete / 
and knoweth not what he hath written.
But the Prophecye of the seyd Iohan
Husse whiche he vttred at the houre of

his deathe / shall make that saynge good.

an hondreth years / they shuld beginne to cō
                  sent
to his doctrine whō at y• tyme they condempned / 
and in proces of tyme graunt it to
be agreable to the scriptures of God. This
Prophecye ded the Bohemes inprint vpon
the one syde of their coynes and so reserued
it from the yeare of owr Lorde a. M.CCCC
and .xv. tyll vnto the yeare of owr Lorde ageyne
a. M.CCCCC. and .xvii. In the wc
Martyne Luther impugned the Popes pardons / 
power / and auctorite by the open worde
of God. And therfor Pantolabꝰ hath spoken
it trulye / that Luther is of the same kynde.
But where as he hath done it of spyght
and malyce / he sheweth himselfe to be of a
contrarye part. As where that Luther is the
popes great enemye / he is his trustye frinde
and louer.

hath so longe vpholden their popishe churche
of proude porkelynges / the synagoge of
Sathan / the rose coloured whore / and the
spowse of the deuyll. This sprete is not the
holye ghost as he is here reported / but the
sprete which went out from the manne and
returned ageyne with .vii. spretes worse thā
himselfe. As with the sprete of errour / the
sprete of falshede / the sprete of sorcerye / the
sprete of lyes / the sprete of fornicacion / the
sprete of hypocresye / and the sprete of the vtter
contēpt of God with all other abhominacyons
of vayneglorye malyce / muther / and
Idolatrye. In these spretes haue they gouerned
their gloriouse churche of Antichrist / euer
sens they sprange vp vndre Phocas wt
Mahomete. Specyallye sens Syluester the
sorcerer fat the deuyll from hell to graunt to
his confirmacion and to geue him the iurisdiccyon
of both swerdes. In these fylthye

which moueth not a lyttle here the sycke

And ther vnto geueth Martyne Luther no
lyberte that is godlye / as testifyeth his boke
de Seruo arbitrio. And therfor is Pantolaꝰ
moche to be blamed so to slaundre him.
But in dede his Lorde of Wynchestre hath

to make it a newe article of the fayth of Englande.
I thinke not the contrarye but his
great hot stodye is also to sett vp purgatorye

And therfor yf Pantolabus fynde fawte in
the bringinge in of that lyberte / lete him blame
his good lorde for it & not Luther. The
synne that he here speaketh of shuld seme to
be Prestes marryage. For that in dede they
put out as an horryble synne whan they toke
their oyled orders and were marryed to
Sodome & Gomor. If Luther hath brought
that in ageyne and dryuen out their souerayne

For holye Pope Hyldebrāde which
was a Necromanser made this constitucion / 
that non shuld be admitted to holye orders / 
vnlesse he forsware marriage for terme
of his lyfe. Which constitucion hurt him
nothinge at all / he hauinge at his pleasur
Mawde y• Duchesse of Lotharyne with manye

O lorde God (sayth Asaph the prophete)
a peple is broken into thyne herytage / 
which hath defyled thy holye temple. If the
Popes churche were ment by that temple / 
this text is falselye applyed to Luther and
his companye. For they haue not broken into
that churche / but gone out of it as all the
worlde knoweth. And in the verses folowinge
are they mencyoned / that destroyed the
faythfull seruaūtes of God by sheding their

for synne. Sumwhat shall it be nedefull
to shewe here to the commendacyon of
that godlye estate of lyuynge / and to the vtter
reproche and shame of the contempners
therof by the scriptures & chronicles. To non

inhybyt prestis their marryage / but to apere
therby an holy spirituall kyngdome deuyded
from the prophane multitude / & to lyue
in all voluptuousnesse & deceyt. Marke fyrst

                  maunded
not Dauid to put from him Bersabe
after the death of Vrias for the aduouterye
afore committed / but both allowed her
after for his wyfe / & also greatlye loued the
seconde frute of her begotten which was
Salomon. The Rome churche as a congregacyon

cleane contrarye to God in that / cō
                  maunded
their prestes first not onlye to forsake
their most lawfull wyues / but also to
leaue their most dere chyldren as frutes of
fornicacyon / which cruelte we haue also felt
in this age. And thus hath holye wedlock
bene vnto them euer sens a most pernycyouse
poyson / and stynkynge whoredome with
buggerye a most suffren remedye of their naturall
dyssease. Soche hath bene their sathanycall

were agayne dyscharged / by vertu of a

Blynde obstinacie / Dame ignoraunce / Debate / 
Ambicion / and so forth. And when that

playne storye / and brought forth out of that / 
Wyclef / Husse / and Luther by name. As moche

the two subtyle verses which went afore / 
wherin ye shall fynde moche good lernyng / 
yf ye marke them wele whan he hath expowned
them. One Melanchtonus (he sayth)
nequaquam bonus / and he sheweth nomore
of him. Is not here thynke you a lompe of
good doctryne: Doth not the prelates of Englande
moche to the common welthe of the
realme / to sende forth soche an wholsom teacher:
yes marrye I trow / and they wolde be
sorye to sende forth anye other. Here is Philip
Melanchion (whom all Christendome
commendeth for his most excellent leruynge)
detected for an heretyque of this braynelesse
hypocrite and blasphe mouse beastlye
babler / non artycles of heresye expressed.
But neuer the worse is the fayre fyne golde / 
though the fylthye ratte beshyteth it. For
nought is it not that this is done in Latyne
he shuld not els apere so well lerned. Sumwhat
we must haue to sprede forth oure shyrtes
with / & to haue oure phylacteri

all were not els worth a fart. But yf Nequa
quam bonus / with insipiēs colonus / had be
put to Hōtyngtonꝰ / it had made a better sonus.
O insipient papistes / that ye haue nomore
wytt but to vttre soche folyshnesse.
All the worlde maye se by this and soche
other / how vayne ye are in youre stodyes / 

and soydle in youre fantasyes.
               3 The scripture that ye haue brought forth
here / out of saynt Paules Epistle to the Romanes / 
Euanuerunt in cogitationibus suis
is as ryghtlye youre owne good as is possyble.
For yt is spoken there vnto them that
withholde the truth of God in vnryghtousnesse / 
as you do here in this iest of yours / 
and as doth youre whole popysshe generacyon / 
becōmynge all vayne in youre thoughtes / 
& hauynge youre folysshe hartes so darkened.
But I maruele sore whan ye redde
that chapter / whye ye marked not this clause
folowynge. Propterea tradidit vos Deus
in passiones ignominie &c. For youre obstynate
frowardnesse hath the sorde geuen you
ouer into most shamefull lustes / and suffred
you to worke fylthynesse amonge yourselues
leauynge the naturall vse of women. This
hath he geuen you as a due rewarde of your
errour / for that ye haue turned his verite to
a lye / and serued the creature rathe
                     •
                   than y•
creator or maker. This therfore doth rather
perteyne to you than to Melanchton: for yo

Sodomites / and not he. you are the abhominable
ydolaters / sensynge styll stockes and
stones / and not he. It is you most execrable
papistes that are there now noted to be full
of iniquite / malyce / fornicacyon /

Came in to helpe.

Pantolabus of y• godlye lerned menne
whom here he rayleth vpon in his
folysshe iest / and that apereth by the vndiscrete
ordre therof. For here he reporteth Oecolampadius
and zwinglius to come after
Melanchton in the mayntenaunce of that
doctryne. Where as they were auncyēt men
whan Melanchton was but a chylde / & were
promoters of the Lordes veryte whan he
knewe nothynge of yt. And therfore the mā
                  ne
is wele ouerseane in the matters he taketh
in hande. Before was Melanchton a
lymme of Luther / and now he is become a
whelpe / but we knowe not wherof. Dogges / 
cattes / and all will be lytle ynough ere we
haue done I feare me / to make a wys

hath destroyd the vynes. Hieremye telleth

haue you no grace to beleue yt.
               2 Ioannes Decolampadius is the first of
the two that ye here blaspheme / which was
borne in the lande of Sueuia. This was a
manne of incomparable lernynge / & a most
pure professour of the Gospell. An excellent
Oratour / Poete / Philosopher / Historiane / 
Lawer / and doctor of diuynite / throughlye
expert in the Latyne / Greke / Hebrue / and
Chaldie / whose innocēt lyfe no manne coude
iustlye reproue. In Bononie / Hyltprunne / 
Heydelberge / Basyle / and Augusta was he
both a common reader and also an open preacher / 
not without great name of his auditorye.
He translated out of the Greke into the
Latyne / manye workes of saynt Iohan Chrisostome / 
saynt Lyrillus / Athanasiꝰ / Damascenꝰ / 
Theophilactus / & other. More than
lvi. volumes vpon the scripturs with other
treatyses compyled he / which are greatlye
cōmended of them that be lerned. Moche a
do he had with Iohan Faber a Suffragan
and fryre / with Eckius / Empser / Cochleus
Fysher of Rochestre / Latomus / Clichtoueꝰ / 
Pyrkeimerus / Pelargus / and diuerse other

great warryours of Antichristes host / whom
he answered by Apologyes / besydes his contynuall
conflictes with the Anabaptistes / 
& other sectes. At the last he departed hence
most godlye in the .liii. yeare of his age /

of Heluecia / was a manne also of moste syngular
erudicyon & equall with y• other in all
feates of lernynge. In all that he ded in his

to be brefe and playne. Neuer was ther anye

as the common sayinge is. A fole in the
mornynge and all daye after not wyse.
He calleth these greate lerned menne praters
of diuynyte / yet was he neuer able to vnderstande
one leafe of their workes. I thynke
yf he were narrowlye examyned / he shulde
a pere not to knowe what true diuy

Of late yeares now at Oxforde their principall
diuynes / as doctor Roper / doctor kyngton

open complayntes that in .xxviii. yeares
stodye they coude not vnderstande Dons.
And as for Christes diuynite / I will beare
them recorde / they knewe yt nothynge at all.
I thynke these for that tyme in their disputacyons
and lecturs were Iolye pratlers of
diuynite. And their frutes wolde declare a
great sort of them to be lyttle better now. Is
not here (thynke you) in this worke of Pantolabus / 
a plesaūt patche of diuynite: It is
no maruele though so noble a clarke as he
complayneth of pratynge / whan his selfe
pratleth here so folyshlye. youre draffyshe

Ockam / Baconthorpe / Durande / Gabriel /

with their supersticyons. ye haue robbed y•
Sophisters of their subtyle conueyaunces /

of Rhetoryke / & the preuye practyses
of philosophie haue ye gathered togyther / to
deceyue all y• worlde that knoweth not your
craftes. Not one slayght is there nor cast of
good legerdemayne that anye iugler hath / 
but ye haue sought yt oute for auauntage.
Soche subtyle sekers ye are yet to this daye:

fewe alyue but knoweth. There is not a poore
wenche that taketh wages / but ye must
haue y• tent part for preuye tythes. There is
not a labourer which lyueth by the sweate of
his browes / but ye must haue a patche therof / 
though his chyldren shulde famyshe at

doctryne afore tyme / but that the peple
shul'd beleue as holye churche doth teache
them? That is to saye that the Pope was
Gods vycar in earthe / & the head of that holye
churche. That he coude not erre / & that
his curse was most to be feared. That purgatorye
was peynefull / pylgrimages wholsom /

The openinge. 1.
               NOt one of these scysmatiques afore rehersed / 
coude Pantolabus fynde in his
hart to appoynt oute for a captayne. yet
were they of a false sedicyouse trayne both
of heresye and treason / as his selfe is yet

                     •
                  yll with other of that affynite. The lorde
Datsye was in those dayes a myghtye great
captayne. So was the lorde Husseye. So were
syr Robert Constable / syr Thomas Percye / 
syr Iohan Bulmer / syr Steuen Hamerton / 
syr George Lumlaye / with Rafe Bulmet / 
Nycolas Tempest / & a great sort more.
Robert Aske was in that pylgrimage of grace
for y• Popes holye churche no small doar / 
though he had but one eye. Nomore was captayne
Cobler / that valeaūt George on horse
backe with his Lyncolne shere bowes and
baggepypes: yet are they not founde fytt to
occupye a rome in this noble Genealogye.
Manye spirituall captaynes also and wyse
counsellers were at the same selfe tyme verye

busye to promote that ghostlye quarell
for
                     •
                  warde. As Iames Locherell the prior of
Gysburgh / Wyllyam Wytlesse the prior of
Brydlyngton / Adam Sedbar Abbot of Garbeleye / 
Wyllyam Thyrske abbot of Fenleye
the abbot of Oborne / the abbot of Sawleye / 
the abbot of Whawleye / the abbot of Glasten
                     •
                  erye / 
the abbot of Redynge / the abbot of
Lolchestre / and the prior of Lenton not farre
from Nothyngham. Besydes that was done
at Walsyngham in Northfolke / by syr Nycolas
Mylam a Chanon / George Gysborow
fryre Peckoc / and other more. But all these
captaynes were out of Pantolabus remembraunce
at this tyme.
               2 Onlye is poore Iohan Frith a captayne
sounde out here to his purpose / because he
was to the Pope a capitall enemye. Though
Pantolabus be but a fole / he knoweth what
he wotteth wele ynough. I warande you he
hath no worse opinyon of all these former
captaynes / than hath the holye father of Rome.
That is to saye / though they were byheaded / 
hanged / & quartered / yet dyed they
full vertuouse menne / as ded holye Thomas
Beckett for the lybertees of holye churche.
By this maye ye se that yt is not all one to
dye forholye churche and to dye for the Gospell.
For they that dye for holye churche are
holye sayntes and martyrs / where as they
that dye for the Gospell are but heretyques
and trayters. But what this will apere in y•
                  
latter iudgement / that daye shall declare / 
when no worldlye polycies will helpe. This
poore yonge manne Iohan Frith / which is
here cōtempned for the veruytees sake / maye
chaunce at that daye as the membre with y•
head / with Christ to iudge y• truthes aduersaryes / 
for folowynge him in the same persecucyon.
For an offyce yt is to a certen sort belongynge.
But sure I am that they are not
those which lyue here voluptuouslye. Than
must yt nedes be they that suffre all wronges
here in that verytees cause.
               3 The wyfe man sayth / that they are those
whom y• worlde had sumtyme in dirisyon / 
thynkynge their doctryne madde folyshnesse
and their latter endes withoute honour.
yet are they rekened amonge the chyldren of
God / & their porcyon is plentyfull amonge
the holye sayntes. Of this vnlerned hypocrite
and braynelesse babler / is Iohan Frith
noted to be without pyth of lernynge & wyte
Where as the contrarye is knowne to his
whole generacyon / which neuer were yet
able to confute his boke of purgatorye agenst
Rastell / More / and Rochestre / besydes his
other workes. The veryte hath yet victorye
at his hande / though he for a tyme be throwne
vndre the aulter / there callynge for a iust
reuengement of that vnpytefull violence so
cruellye here ministred vnto him. What pythe
of wytt and lernynge Pantolabus had
whan he wrote this Genealogie / yt is wele

perseyued of them that hath redde yt / yf they
were not as he is / all wytlesse and gracelesse.
Scarselye worth a nytt is the best verse
therof / to him that shall seke eyther wytt or
lernynge. But as the sayinge is / draffe is
good ynough for swyne / and dyrtye puddynges
for dogges. As good as the best is this
fylthye baggage for the Papistes / which seketh
nothynge els but errours and lyes in
hypocrisye.
               4 In his allegacyon of scripture / Pantolabus
shulde seme neyther to be wytty nor
lerned. For in both his cappyes imprinted
by Iohan Redman and Robert Wyer / he noteth
yt to be in the .xii. Psalme of Dauid / 
and yt is not there / but in the .xii. chapter of
Salomons Prouerbes. There is this text
in dede. Via stulti recta in oculis eius. Loke
what a fole taketh in hande / that thynketh
he onlye wele done. A verye folyshe syght
hath Pantolabus in Genealogies to take y•
father for y• sonne. Of a lykelyhode he dreamed
that he was at Mattens whan he was
at masse / by takynge of Dauid for Salomon
By the orderyng of his scripturs / he semeth
better lerned in his portas or Masse boke / 
than in the sacred Byble. No where had that
text bene better bestowed / than vpon his
owne precyouse bodye / yf he had seane himselfe
ryghtlye. For by his shadowe we maye
trace out an ydyote / moche more by his persone / 
& most of all by his doltyshe doctryne

here ministred. In the same chapter is this
text also: verte impios & non erunt / domus

of the ryghtouse shall neuer perishe.
Frith shall be cōmended for his godlye wysdome / 
whan Pantolabus shall be reputed a
presumptuouse fole. Abominable are deceytfull
lyppes before the Lorde / but they that labour
for the truthe doth please him greatlye.

¶The openinge. 1.
               ODyouse vnto Pantolabus is Iohan
Frith aboue all other / and that apereth
by this. Though he hath afore
here accused Wyclef / Husse / Luther / Melanchton / 
Oecolampadius / and zwinglius
for heretyques / yet hath he layde agaynste
them non artycles of heresye. But now in a
great fume he layeth to Iohan Frithes charge
the sacramēt of the aultre / and that with
no small circumstaūce. Manye menne thynketh
that this hote enterpryse of his / is more
for the losse that he and soche other hath

so malancholye / madde / and modye agaynst
heretyques. They are not cōtented that Iohan
Frith was so playne in his wrytynges
concernynge that matter / wherin all their
commodyte and profyghtes lyeth enclosed.
Had he medled with anye other thynge els / 
he had not so fore displeased them. For yf

               2 Wonderfullye haue they busyed themselues
to holde vp that buyldynge of theirs.

Afterthat their Pope had ones optayned
of Phocas the false emprour to be head of y•

adioyned to the sacrament. Than were
vnyuersytees founded euerye where by monkes
also to vpholde that newe buylded butteras.
Than stode forth Peter the Lombarde
or the Master of their sentences / which
was begotten / bredde / and borne of an holye

myracles folowynge / as was seane at
Lynos / Parys / Calys / Brucels / Schiedam / 
and in manye other places els. And so was
yt clerelye altred from Christes institucyon / 
and became throughlye the abominacyon of
desolacyon / as wytnesseth Iohan Wyclef in
his .iii. chapter de Eucharistia. Than had
the bisshoppes at their handes their Sophisters

                     •
                  iciouse subtyltees
to defende yt for a blessed sacramēt.
And whan that lowsye lernynge wolde not
serue them / than had they vpon their sydes
to dispute with agaynst y• heretyques / both
sweedes and halters / fyre and faggottes / as
they haue yet styll to this houre.
               3 I wolde that the text which Pantolabꝰ
bringeth in here out of Salomons Prouerbes / 
to proue that Christes bodye is reallye
present in the blessed sacrament / were dilygentlye
marked of the reader. It is not these / 
De stusti pascitur imperitia / as Pantol
                     •

xv. chapter. De stultorum pascetur imper
                     •
                  
                  tia / 
yf ye take their olde text. The mouthe
of fooles shall befedde with all folyshnesse.
Of a lykelyhode Pantolabꝰ hath some priuylege
of the Pope / that he maye at his pleasur
peruert the scripturs in the defence of holye
churche. yet proueth not this peruerted
text that Christ is reallye present in the sacrament.
But in dede it declareth what Pantolabus
is / both reallye / naturallye / formallye / 
and substanciallye / and so doth in a maner
all the whole chapter besydes. Sone after
the begynnynge therof / is soche an other:
lyke clause. De fatuorum ebullit stultitiam.
The mouth of lewde fooles boyleth out folyshe
bablynges / as are the Poeticall verses
of Pantolabus boke here / and all the ynke
horne termes also of their doctors afore rehersed
here for their blessed sacramēt. More
fytlye had this clause of the same chapter
bene applyed to that sacrament as it is now
vsed. Victime impiorum abominabiles Domino.
Abhominable to y• Lorde are the sacrifyces
of the wycked / where as the prayer of
the ryghtouse is acceptable. Fylthye is the
waye of the vngodlye / but he that foloweth
ryghtousnesse is in Gods fauer. For whye y•
ceremonyes therof are the Popes & not his.
The brekefast is the prestes alone / and no
communyon of Christes peple to knytt them
vp togyther as members into his mysticall
bodye.

¶The openinge. 1.
               PRoudelye styll pratleth this popishe
Poete / accusynge Iohan Frith for not
graūtynge Christes reall presence in
their sacrament. And here he cōuerteth his
fantasyed realyte into Christes fleshe and
blood / callynge it the lyuelye fode of y• sowle
Godlye wyse was Iohan Frith / and so shall
he fynde it in the latter daye / in that he wolde
not attribute vnto Christ that thynge / wt
is not founde in y• scripturs. A popishe lyuerye
is that realite of theirs / sophisticallye
borrowed of Aristotles logyck. He wolde in
no case be accursed of the mouthe of God for
addynge soche beggerye to his worde. Rather
ded he (good creature) offre his bodye
to the fyre. I thynke not the contrarye of I
                     •
                  
                  han
Frith / but yf their sacrament had bene
Christes as it is the Popes / in the colours it
is in now / he had graunted vnto it moche
more than he ded. Christes fleshe is no soche
pouetrye / nor his blood soche māmetrye / 
as their mangye myracles hath made it.

For yf their corruptyble breade were that
lyuelye fode of sowle / than had all they peryshed / 
which hath not so outwardlye receyued
it afore tyme. As Adam / Noe / Abraham / 
Moyses / Dauid / Helias / with all the
other fathers which dyed afore Christ. They
receyued both his bodye and blood / els had
they not bene saued. For saynt Paule doth
saye that all they and we haue eaten of one
spirituall meate and drōcke of one spirituall
drincke / one harde rocke ministrynge it vnto
ve both. In sprete & veryte (sayth Christ)
shall the true worshippers worshippe him / 
and not in outwarde thynges that are seane
with the eye / for they remayne onlye to the
false worshippers or ydolaters.
               2 Neyther haue youre Realyte power to
make youre blessed sacrament Christes flesshe
nor yet his blood. Neyther can ye therby
proue it oure lyuelye food nor yet oure 
                     •
                  owles
helthe / though ye a thousande tymes
put it thervnto. For so moche as it cometh
not from y• expresse worde of God / but from
the fylthye doctryne of youre Philosophers / 
which were non other but fylthye ydolaters.
Rathe
                     •
                   shulde it seme therfore to conuert it
into an ydoll to oure sowles destruccyon / 
than into Christes fleshe to oure sowles cō
                  solacyon.
A lyuelye fode it maye wele be vnto
you which are fedde therwith daylye at
youre austers / but wele I wote in that kynde
it is non vnto vs in y• churches bodye which

haue no part therof. An onlye welthe it maye
be vnto youre generacyon which take the
swete profytes therof / & lyueth therby in all
boluptuouse pleasurs of ydelnesse. But how
it shulde be the helthe of youre sowles in
that kynde of clowtynge / that can I not wele
tell you. Wele I wote it is neyther welthe
nor helthe vnto vs. For a great vndoynge
hath it bene to the comonwelthe / and is
yet a most ruynouse decaye of the peples sowle
helthe / the eternall father redressel it. ye
will saye parauenture ye make it Christes
fleshe by the speakynge of his worde vnto it
Christ neuer taughte yow to preache his
worde in a foren language to a thynge that
is dumme / but to the lyuynge peple in their
natyue language / that they myght beleue
and be saued. He bad you distribute that brede
vnto other / and not to slaffe it vp youre
selues. He commaunded also the peple to eate
it / but in no case to worship it. Neuer was
it worshipped in the churche / tyll it had youre
Realyte / which Christ neuer graunted to
youre breathynge.
               3 The scripture that is here alleged oute
of the sixt of Iohan. Qui manducat hunc
panem / viuet in eternum / condempneth the
whole doctrine of Pantolabꝰ madde meters
here / both by the sequele of the same chap.
and also by the opynion of all the olde doctors
which nameth it a spirituall eatynge.
In all that processe doth Christ reproue the

requirynge a beleue of them that will be
saued. For at that tyme nor yet of a yeare after
was not that holye supper of his instituted.
Christ there admonished both his owne
disciples and y• Capernaytes not to labour
for the meate that perisheth with the bellye / 
but for that which endureth into the lyfe
euerlastynge which is his eternall worde.
And whan they grodged at his heaueulye
aduertysementes / he declared vnto them
what he ment by that eatynge / fayeng. Qui
credit in me / habet vitam eternam. He that
beleueth on me / hath the lyfe euerlastynge.
As who shulde saye / that there to eate / is to
beleue accordynge to his worde. Whan Christe
after that he had declared hymselfe to be
the breade of lyfe / and that his fleshe was
meate and his blood verye drincke / and that
they which ded eate him shuld lyue for euer.
He gaue them this for a full cōclusyon of the
vnderstandynge of that eatynge and drinckynge.

quyckeneth / the carnall eatynge profyteth

him / Iudas ded kysse him / and the cruell Iewes
towched his bodye / yet were they for

The openinge. 1.
               QVycke is Pantolabus in his matters
now / & quauereth in his quybybles
at large. He cutteth his crotchettes
as short as chyldes dyrt / that they shulde
tonne rounde on his tonge. Now is Iohan
Frith a braynelesse nodye / because he hath
not written to his mynde. But what a wytlesse
wrangeler is he / and a dodypoll dawe
pat
                     •
                   / that thus will talke with a dead manner.
A cōmon custom is it amonge the vnlerned
papistes / onlye to inueye agaynst them
that are gone. Neuer will they meddle with
them which are alyue / vnlesse they be sure
to burne them or to hange them. Truthe it
is that Christ hath sayd / that his bodye is
meate / and that he which doth not receyue
that meate cā haue no lyfe in him. But what
that eatynge is can not Pantolabꝰ tell / or at
y• last he hath not yet taught it. Christ sayth
that to eate his flesshe and to dryncke his
blood / is to dwell in him by fayth and loue / 
and he agayne to dwell in vs by his sprete of

veryte / and not to heare youre popishe masse
or to receyue youre sacrament. An infynite
nombre of people haue thus eaten him and
droncke him / which neuer knewe what your
massynge or how sellynge ment / & shall lyue
perpetuallye in that refeccyon. Not one euer
perished that so hath receyued him / where
as thousandes hath bene lost that hath bene
fedde at youre aulters.
               2 Whereas his fleshe is eaten and surelye
dygested / there is seane nomore whoremongynge / 
theft / fornicacyon / ydelnesse / 
wytchecraft / cruelte / spyght / couetousnesse / 
ydolatrye / hatred / glotonye / and other fylthye
vyces of the fleshe. But loue / ioye / peace / 
pacience / longe sufferynge / gentylnesse / 
goodnesse / faythfulnesse / mekenesse / clennesse / 
temperaunce / with other frutes of the
sprete. It is not youre oyled generacyon therfore / 
nor yet they that are howseled at their
masses that eateth Christes fleshe & drynketh
his blood / which for the more part styll
remayne whoremongers / buggerers / robbers / 
cloyners / catchers / false teachers / hypocrites / 
ydolaters / trayters / deceyuers / 
bellye goddes / extorcy
                     •
                  ners / murtherers of
sowles / and burnets of innocentes for their
true Christen beleue. Where as Christ is
eaten / he dwelleth. And whereas he dwelleth / 
he will suffre no soche workes to be done.
That persone can be no blasphemouse
babler / no instructour of lyes / no dysdayner

of Gods worde / no peruetter of y• scripturs / 
as Pantolabus is here through oute all his
iest. He shall not iudge that to be whyghte
that is blacke / nor yet that is blacke to be
whyght. But his syght shall be soche by the
gyft of his sprete / that the thynge which is
nought he shall so discerne it / hath it neuer
so manye gloryouse glytterynge colours to
the contrarye.
               3 As Pantolabus is in his poesyes / so is
he in his allegacyons of the scripture / a verye
vnlerned ydyote / applyenge them both
to his folyshe fleshlye purpose. He thynketh
with Caromea vere est cibus / to proue that
Christes fleshe is reallye present in their popyshe
sacrament. And Christ meaneth nothyngelesse
in that whole chapter. He sayth
not there my fleshe shall be naturallye present
in youre sacrament / whan ye haue ones
prouyded youre oyled offycers and consecrate
coniurers for that purpose. But my fleshe
is meate / and my blood is vnfaynedlye drynke / 
afore there were anye soche 
                     •
                  wlyshe orders.
He promysed nor to dwell in that / but
to dwell in vs euermore. The kyngedome of
God (sayth he) cometh not with outwarde
obseruacyon of lo here / and se there. For beholde
the kyngdome of God is within yow.
youre members (sayth saynt Paule) are the
temple of God / and youre sowles the habitacles
of the holy ghost. It foloweth in that
Gospell hic est panis qui de celo descendit.

He is the breade which came from heauen / 
& not that breade which came from the wafer
backers or from the breathyng of syr Laurence
Loyterer at the aulter. The worke of
God is onlye to beleue / & not to fatche that
bread at youre ydell handes. They dye that
eate youre breade / and ronne headlynges to
the deuyll a greate sort of them / as ded manye
of the Iewes that eate Manna in the
desart. But they that eate this breade shall
neuer perishe.

him not thynke so to wynne anye greate

his corps be dead / his sprete is alyue.

Non other victorye haue ye / than had Cayphas
ouer Christ / and the deuyll ouer Iob / 
tryumphe ye neuer so fast. ye maye ponnyshe
the bodye and geue it to death / but ouer the
sowle ye haue no power. Blessed is that mā
                  ne
that euer he was borne / which perseuereth
faythfull to the ende / as Iohan Frith
hath done. That he penned by his lyfe concernynge
the sacrament and their popyshe
purgatorye / is not greatlye hyndred here as
yet ōy Pantolabus dyrtye dartes. The greatest
acte he hath done / is that he hath here
paynted vs out a fole of himselfe.
               2 Here is it layed vnto Iohan Frithes
charge / that he shulde denye Christes wordes / 
because he wolde not in his boke admyt
Aristotles realyte in their sacramēt. In dede
he neuer denyed Christes worde / for than
he shulde haue done as you do alwayes / & so

haue denyed Christ himselfe which is all
one with his worde. He euermore affermed
that Christes fleshe was verye meate & his
blood verye dryncke / but not for the bodye.
yet denyed he not the corporall eatynge. He
graunted also that he was verye bread / and
that he which eateth that breade shall lyue
for euer. yet wolde he not haue that bread
which came from the waffer backers / to be
all one with that breade which came from
heuen. For saynt Augustine sayth that their
eatynges be diuerse. The one is eaten with
the mouthe / the other with y• fayth. The one
with the lyppes / the other with the harte.
The one with the bodye / the other with the
sowle. He wolde in no case haue them to come
in both at one dore. youre 
                     •
                  ordes wolde
not Frith afferme / because they are not Christes
but Aristotles. youre wayes are all after
the Master of your sentēces / which was
in an whoryshe nonne a fylthye frute of your

Helyoth / Holcoth / Brulifer / Dorbel / & other
dyrtye diuynes forth yssuynge from him (in
whom sathā hath wrought euer sens he was
sett at large) refusynge the Apostles doctryne.
And that caused Iohan Frith neuer
to agre vnto you.
               3 His reasons are neuer the worse that

youre pylde popyshe brayne do not allowe
them. Peuysh ynough are your poesyes / and
more peuyshe a great deale youre pylde wyttes.
What youre reasons are / it is playne to
all them / which hath eyther wytt or lernynge.
The value of them is sone rekened now
that they are come to y• towche stone. I thynke
verelye they are neyther worth two peasons / 
nor yet worth two nyttes or antes egges.
The reasons and auctorytees of Iohan
Frith concernynge Christes bodye & blood / 
standeth yet vntowched for all you. Moche
more vndischarged. It is ynough for you to
rayle and to prate / to bragge & to lye / though
ye do nothynge els. ye fare lyke a gargull in
a wall with a spowte in his mouthe / which
doth nothynge els but spewe oute water. ye
sett a greate face here vpon the matter / as
though the Popes churche were holden vp
by you / and nothynge do ye at all but vomete
fylthye swyllynges. More lyke are you and a
sort of youre fellawes more / to pull downe
youre holye mother / than to kepe her vp longe / 
yf ye haue no better lernynge than ye
shewe here. Iohan Wyclef prophecyed that
your churche shuld haue an ende / had veryte
ones the victorye. Which is in short space
lyke to be founde true / yf ye plye not youre
matters apace.
               4 Disdaynefullye cast ye it in Iohan Frithes
teathe here / that he dyed in the fyre at

                     •
                   procuremēt of your prelates. As though it

were a greate ignominye to dye for the Lordes
veryte. But precyouse in y• syght of that
lorde was the death of that faythfull yonge
manne / though it were verye wretched in
your syghtes regardynge nothynge but that
which is pleasaunt to the fleshe. What your
ende shall be / the Lorde of heauen knoweth.
ye haue yet layser ynough to playe the felde
bysshop / and to blesse with youre heles in an
hempen corde / as a great sort of youre fellawes
haue done which were as true menne
as you are here. Therfore ye are not wyse to
disdayne anye mannys ende / nor yet to iudge
him yll that departeth in Christes fayth.
ye maye wele knowe that Christes deathe
was not verye precyouse to your proude predecessors
the bysshoppes / pharysees / & lawers / 
whan they went vp and downe there
mockynge and mowynge as you do now here
with youre meters. No better is the seruaūt
than his master / nor yet the disciple than he
that sent him. Full vnlyke is y• syght of god

                  rutable iudgementes
to youre carnall iudgemētes. Blessed
is Iohan Frith that he suffreth styll at
your handes these obprobryes for his holye

of heauen.

receyued it of you agayne. But now it is
youre owne ragged stuffe & not his. He hath

chosen people of God vndre Pharao / hath
worthelye sufferd accordynge to their many
folde wyckednesses. He is not contented wt
you nor yet with soche other false Prophetes
as will so preposterouslye bestowe his scripturs / 
as to geue that to gods fryndes which
belongeth to his enemyes. In the ende of
that chapter is this text folowynge / wherin
Iohan Frith hath now his porcyon / but
that coude not Pantalabꝰ perseyue. In omnibus

¶The openinge. 1.
               SEryouslye hath Pantolabus sought
his wyttes here / to clowte vp his Genealogie
with sumwhat. But I maruele
moche that for .v. years space betwixt the
burnynges of Iohan Frith and Iohan Lambert / 
he coude fynde out non els for his purpose.
His bloodye generacyon of mytred mahoundes
and their shauen sergeaūtes / were
not wonte to be so longe vnoccupyed. His holye
mother (whom saynt Iohan reporteth to
be droncke in the blood of martyrs) was not
wonte to fast so longe from that drynke / but
wolde coole her hote thirst ere that tyme / 
hauynge so fyerye a stomake / wele I wote
that manye than suffred at London / Colchestre / 
Hadleye / Ippeswyck / Norwyche / Lynne / 
and in other more places of Englande.
Good Wyllyā Tyndale was done to death
also at Vylforde in Braban within the same
years / by the procurement of youre craftye

Cayphases / in the yeare of oure Lorde a M.
V. and .xxxv. in the moneth of Septembre
And therfore I wondre they escaped youre
hande. This maketh vs to thynke that ye
entended of these onlye with those that here
foloweth to iest at youre pleasure / vpon
soche malyce as ye had agaynst them conceyued.
Sure are you to be of soche a secte / 
as will worke lyttle goodnesse. Lete menne
suspect of you what they will / but these popyshe
poesyes of yours smell knauyshlye / 
whan ye can fynde out non other heretyques
but these alone / of so manye Popes / poyseners / 
trayters / sorcerers / Sodomites / scysmatyques / 
and pestylent papistes as hath
bene / and are yet styll to this daye.
               2 Because ye are here in hande with Lambert / 
I will saye sumwhat for him / for I knewe
his cōuersacyon. The truthe of it is / he
was sumtyme a prest of youre generacyon / 
called syr Iohan Nycols / and was borne in
the cyte of Norwyche. After that he had in
Cambryge geuen himselfe to good letters / 
and became sumwhat expert both in the Latyne
and the Greke / at the preachynges of
the good menne Arthure and Bylneye / he
toke repentaunce of his former lyfe. And after
that the kynge by his lawfull offycers
had taken of him an othe to renounce the Pope
as a false vsurper / he threwe from him
that Antichristes yoke with his lyuerye and
marke to shewe himselfe throughlye obediēt

Than leauyng papistycall customes / he enbraced
the Gospell for his lyfes direccyon / 
& lyued otherafter a vertuouse Christen lyfe / 
which you iudge here a lyfe peruert / soche is
youre owne Englyshe terme. This wolde I
not wryte so manyfestlye / yf I knewe it not
for a certente. Where as he was before an
ydell Massemonger and an hater of the scripturs / 
he became than a fauorer and folower
of them. yea / he taught them vnto other
and lyued his selfe accordynge to the same.
Manye Christen instruccyons wrote he to
his bretherne / & brought vp their chyldren
in all vertu. Dyuerse workes of Erasm
                     •
                  s / 
and of other good authors more / translated
he into the vulgar Englyshe tonge to the
Christen commodyte of other.
               3 And whereas Pantolabus wryteth him
here to be a manne almost woode / for that he
was not in fayth and opinyon to his folyshe
mynde agreable. He declareth himselfe to
be of lyke iudgement with those relygyouse
curates of the Iewes Synagoge / which reported
Iohan Baptist to be a madde manne
for his abstinence / and Christ to be a dronckarde
for his good felyship kepyng. But lete
him not thynke easlye to auoyde this slaunderouse
report before the eternall iudge / vnlesse
he repent in tyme. What so euer thu art
(sayth saynt Paule) that iudgest an other / 
this shalt thu be sure of forthyne owne part / 
to condemne thyselfe / perfourmynge the same

selfe thynges that thu condemnest him
of. Moche more than / yf it be left in wrytynge / 
as this outragyouse slaundre is / that he
was a manne peruert and almost wood.
Though I and soche other which haue redde
ouer Pantolabus iest here / ded not iudge
him a fellawe of a peruerse opinyon and doctryne / 
and a Bedlem beast more than madde / 
the seyd iest it selfe wolde do it for vs.
Therfore lete him not saye that we iudge
him agayne here / for his owne fylthye frutes
declareth him. How abhomynably the
scripturs are here peruerted for a trayterouse
popyshe purpose / to vpholde the fylthye
kyngedome of Antichrist / it will be euydent
to him that shall serche the places.
               4 Now cometh here one in / borowed of y•
first chapter of saynt Paule to the Romanes
Marke the good workemanlye handelynge
(I praye ye) therof. Sicut non probauerunt

haue not regarded to knowe their lord god / 
so hath he geuen them ouer into a lewde
mynde. And what is this text to the purpose
to proue that Iohan Lambert was a manne
peruert and almost wood? This is there
a conclusyon of an olde stynkynge matter of
yours goynge but a lyttle afore / and therfore
lete it not be left so cowardlye behynde you.

whoredome / Idelnesse / buggerye / and the

                  ouse
forbyddynge of meates / and their abhominable
peruerting of the scripturs with their
sophistrye / sorcerye / wyles / wytchecraftes / 
decrees / decretals / actes / clementynes / extrauagantes / 
pryuileges / bulles / & prouinciall
synodals / makynge playne merchandyce
both of the bodyes and sowles of menne.
This have they done before all menne both
with tunge and penne / lyke as Pantolabus
here reporteth of Lambert.
               2 I wyst wele this goodnesse had a tayle
which at the latter ende wolde not seme
verye good. Lambert both with tunge and
penne was a contynuall aduersarye to their
holye Masse / which is their princypall market / 
and that is the cause that he is here regestred
for an heretyq̄
                  
                     •
                   yea / marrye set / now

vnderstande the matter moche better than
I coude afore. Now can I tell yow what heresye
is as ye take it / and who be the heretyques
that yow meane. Not they that speake
ageynst the father of heauen with Sabellius
and Arrius. Nor they that blaspheme y•
sonne with Porphirius and Photinus / Nor
yet they which impugne the holye ghost wt
Macedonius and Eunomius. But they onlye
which replye ageynst yowr Masse / made
by so manye holye Popes. They poore sowles
are alone in this yowr Genealogye / and
non other heretyques els. By this we perscyue
that ye are those yll stewardes whō saint
Paule speaketh of / that seke yowr owne and
not Iesus Christes / makynge of yowr bellyes
your God. yowr vayne glorye (sayth he)
wyll be yowr confusion / for nothinge ye sauer
but that which is earthlye. What is
yowr Masse els but a gawdishe fopperye or
a toye of yowr owne ymaginacyon? Nomore
is it lyke the holye supper of Christ / than y•
earthe is lyke heauē or fylthye dyrt lyke golde.
No / make of it the best ye cāne with your
lyghtes / vestymentes / copes / Iewels / aultres / 
Images / organes / prycksonge / sensynges / 
& the deuyll and all / as y• paganes ded
in their olde sacrifices before their Idols.
               3 If Lambert graunted yow that in yowr
Masse so patched and peced with papystrye
was a synifycacion of Christes deathe / ye
were moche to blame so to burne him. For

he graunted yow more than anye māne will
do els / that is godlye wyse and lerned. But
surelye he neuer graūted that to yowr Masse / 
but to the most holye supper of the lorde / 
and therfor ye haue mysvnderstande his saynges.
In yowr Masse is nothinge but that
ye make yowrselues by the vertu of Arystotles
realyte. No / though ye .vii. tymes breathe
ouer it / Hoc est corpus meum. For christ
is neuer made but in vs / and that is by the
vertu of his worde trulye taught. And that
is the cause that Saynt Paule ded saye.
So oft as ye shall eate this breade and drynke
of this cuppe / ye shall shewe the lordes
deathe tyll he come. Whan Christ badde ye
do it in his remembraunce he badde ye not
make him ageyne. The trayuelynge womā
which is with childe in the Apocalyps / betokeneth
Christes people / hauinge him within
them and not without them. More ouer
Dauid sayth that the bewtyfull dowter of y•
kynge is all from within. yowr Masse mongers
turne their tayles to the people & preache
to the wall as Antichrist hath thaught
them / but neuer turne they to them declaringe
the true meaninge therof / as Christ
hath commaūded. And therfor their fylthye
sacrifyces are Antichristes and not Christs
and that they make there is an Idoll and
no God / and therfor vnmete to be worshipped.
They shal aryse in the morninge (saith
the lorde) and not fynde me / they shall call
vnto me whan I shall not heare them / and

whan they holde vp their polluted handes / 
I shall turne awaye my face.
               4 Nothynge to the purpose is this allegacyon
of Salomons Prouerbes. 
                     •
                  esis sapiens

Masse is sumwhat more than a signifycacyon
of Christes passyon. And agayne y• text
is falselye placed / for it is not in y• first chapter / 
but in the .iii. This craftye cōueyaunce
of yours / is to playe boo pepe with the symple
people. ye ruffle out youre scripturs / but
whan menne shall seke them / they shall be
sure not to fynde them where you appoynt
them / least they shulde with them fynde out
also youre iuglynges. This is now the .iii.
tyme ye haue played this towche / lete youre
conueyaūce be sumwhat cleaner. If ye laye
that text vnto Lambertes charge / that he
was to wyse in his owne conceyt / ye do him
moche wronge / for that cōcept is yours and
not his. you haue for that folyshe conceyt of
yours / putta syde all the wysdome of God.
Vtterlye despyse you Christes institucyon / 
accountynge him / but an ydyote fole that

The openinge. 1.
               UErelye these poesyes are straunge
& diuerse. They make me to remembre
the processyon of Maydston in
kent. For some of them daunse lyke greate
gyauntes and are eyght syllabes a pece. As
this verse here afore. But a significacyon.
Some come doppynge after lyke lyttle hoppe
on my thombes / and are but .iiii. syllabes
as. And vtterlye / with his fellawe as short
as he. And therfore it is but madde gere.
But what is it (I praye you) that Lambert
ded denye? That Christ was his Lorde. No
verelye ded he not / but stode stedefastlye by
it vnto the verye death / that he was his onlye
sauer / peacemaker / helthe / ryghtuousnesse / 
and redemer. He alone was the lambe
that dyed for him. And he alone was y• head

of that churche that he was a membre of.
In this fayth perseuered he vnto his latter
ende / and in the same departed vnto his lorde
God. yet sought your generacion by most
turkyshe tyrannye to compell him to remoue
his fote from that rocke. But mercyfull was
that lorde vnto him. In the myddes of the
fyre denyed not he his veryte / but departed
hence with the clere victorye ouer you. Non
of the Popes sworne subiectes dyed he / but
the verye true seruaunt of Iesus Christ.
               2 His denyall was in dede that Christ
shuld be contayned in the bankett of youre
blessynge. Remembre first from whens your
blessynges come / and out of whose auctorite
they sprange first of all. Saynt Iohan sayth
in the Apocalyps that the Dragon (ye wote
whom he meaneth) gaue his auctoryte / seate / 
and power vnto the great Beast that arose
out of the see. And in an other chapter folowyng
he sayth also / that y• worldlye gouernours / 
as emprours / kynges / and princes / 
shuld applye their strengthes (which consisteth
in their lawes / swerdes / & scepturs)
vnto the same fylthye freke. Of this Beast
haue you that marke wherwith ye bye & sell.
youre 
                     •
                  yles and shauynges are not of Christ
nomore are youre myters and typpettes. If

                     •
                  s and Alexander / 
with other of y• same affynite / for they were

of a kyndred prouyded of God to soche offyces
of externe obseruacions / but yet not to
make newe goddes nor yet to sence ymages.
youre vncommaunded exorcysmes and blessynges
are non other than the playne practyses
of Necromancye. By the vertu wherof / 
though ye maye with youre Pope fatche the
deuyll from hell (for youre sacrifices are all
one) yet can ye not drawe the sonne of God
out of heauen and so make oure crede of non
effecte.
               3 yet can ye not out of youre ragged realyte / 
borowed of the Paganes lernynge / for

                     •
                  ant of scripturs to youre mynde. Ther will
ye haue him to be reallye / onlye whan ye
shall commaunde him. That is to saye / that
the thynge there in syght made of flower
and water / is verye he in dede by the vertu
of youre office. ye will haue him there also
substanciallye in his owne propre persone / 
in lengthe and in breadethe / in form

But ye can not tell vs whether he sytteth

but moche maruele that ye requyre so great

¶The openinge. 1.
               WOrshyplye doth this Poete bestowe
his wyttes here / yf ye marke him wele / 
flatterynglye fawnynge vpon some
great pyller of his churche for a vaun
                  
                     •
                  age / 
though it be not vpon his good lorde
of Wynchestre. A common custome is it of
these vayne hypocrites and ydell wytted papistes / 
to cloyne with all craftye colours and
ingyns possyble for to crepe into the fauer of
those that the worlde lawheth vpon. Wo be
vnto you false prophetes (sayth Ezechiel)
that some pyllowes vndre mennys arme holes
and bolsters vndre their heades / to catche
sowles with all for lucre. Moche better
(sayth Salomon) are the strypes of a louer / 
than the frawdelent kysses of a flatterer.
More profyght is it to be chastened of a wyse
manne / than to be deceyued by the lawhynge
of foles. Soche a false flatterer wolde
not Dauid regarde / but cōmaunded him
strayght wayes to be slayne. By these flatterynge
meters it is easye to perseyue what

Pantolabus seketh here. A benefyce of my
lorde to synge for butterflyes / that the profyghtes
therof myght pamper him vp in all
ydelnesse. And for that he hath magnyfyed
his good lordeshyppe here with a lye / in reportynge
him to proue Lambert a fole in the
disputacion of their sacrament / and to sett
him agayne to scole to declyne this pronowne
hoc. But I feare me they will proue foles
both / his good lorde and he / ere the matter
be fullye ended.
               2 The diuynite of this great diuyne of
his / will scarselye apere good sophistrye or
yet simple gramer after olde Alexanders
rewles / be it ones tryed by the scripturs. I
thynke it be no better than course legerdemayne / 
for all these gloriouse glauerynges.
Diuinare is sumtyme to gesse at a venture / 
and thervpon (I suppose) he calleth him here
a diuyne / and not for anye truthe he hath
vttered therin / or in anye other godlye matter
els as yet. Not onlye is this great pyller
of holye churche thus regestred here of Pantolabus
in this his genealogie of heresye / 
that he shulde be good lorde vnto him in an
other matter / as yf a benefyce fell that he
myght be preferred for this his good zele / 
but also his good diuynite is putt in here
with him. The nature of this dowtye diuynite
is to stande moche in the declynynge of
pronownes / as he hath here full poeticallye
described it. This was in the olde tyme but

boyes playe in the gramer scoles / and now
it is taken vp for hygh diuynite in the consistorye
scoles of the papistes / to proue Christ
reallye and substanciallye present in their
sacrament. Lyke is it to be no small matter
for menne to be burned for / are they haue done
with it / that hath so substancyall proues
or argumentes. Necessarye is it to declyne a
pronowne wele / for him that will knowe the
mysterye therof after their meanynge. Now
forsoth here is godlye Christen lernynge
crept latelye into Englande for the mayntenaunce
of their newe Christen beleue.
               3 Sumwhat must these braggynge hypocrites
haue alwayes to blynde with the eyes
of the simple / which neuer seketh oute their
wyles. So folyshe are they that they nothynge
els beleue / but that they haue in falsehede
taught them / as the blynde with the blynde
so fallynge into the dytche. Here is it boasted
of Pātolabꝰ that his good lorde of Wynchestre
that greate diuyne proued lambert
an heretyque with this pronowne hoc. The
sentence that Christ spoke at his last supper
amonge his disciples and bretherne / had
neyther hic nor hoc / for it was in the Hebrue
speche which hath neyther of both. Wherefore
the declynynge of hoc maketh nothynge
at all for the tryall of anye veryte therin.
More to the purpose had the comparynge or
conferrynge of that Latine pronowne with
panis or with corpus bene / than the declyn
                     •
                  nge

therof. That is yet all togither to folyshe.
I put Wynchestre and Pantolabus
the case / that the Hebrue hath not the newtre
gendre / as it hath not in dede. How will
they thā with their newe diuinite declyne
their pronowne hoc? I thinke both their wittes
wyll scarselye wele serue them / hauinge
no better helpe thā themselues. Erasmꝰ
saith also in his annotacions / that this verbe
substantyue est / is not in the Greke nomore
than it is in the Hebrue. I maruele how
they wolde handle this matter also yf they
shuld grāmaticallye declyne it. It is a worlde
(they saye) to heare foles prate whan they
be vpon their alebenche.
               4 Now cometh forth the text / that must
make vp all their market / yf it be not all togither
ageynst thē / which is to be feared. We
fynde not in y• Gospell neyther of Matthew
Marke / nor Luke / nor yet in Paule to the Corinthes / 
that Christ breathed vpon y• bread
whan he seyd / Hoc est corpus meum. For all
they make mensyon that it was out of his
handes and delyuered to his Apostles befor
he spake those wordes. Therfor that breathinge
of yowrs vpon the breade / is but a
newe sounde toye of yowr owne sorcerye / to
make men beleue that ye are great doers by
the vertu of yowr oylinges and shauinges.
He gaue thankes in dede vnto God his father
but the wordes of his thankesgeuinge
(which were the wordes of his consecraciō)

he lest not here be hinde him / soryow to df

custome (for your occupaciō is nothinge els
but crafte) to gelde yowr scriptures of so moche

was as wele allowed in Christes consecracion
(as yow falselye take it) as had Hoc est
corpus meū. And I thinke verely that y• one
declareth the other after his meanyng / but
not after your subtile meaning for your aduā
                  tage.
He called that his body that shuld be
betrayed for thē / now construe you y• rest because
yeare so cōning in construcciōs. By as
clarkely diuinite as you do vse here / a māne
might axe yow whether ye call that hoc of
yowrs / this or that? As this is my bodye wt

eaten. For he badde them both take and eate / 
and paused sumwhat after / before he sayd
This is my bodye which shall be betrayed
for yow.

a poore membre of his / full blockyshlye
callinge him a blocke hauinge nought to saye
(he saith) whan his reuerende lorde disputed
with him / neyther yea nor naye. And I
beleue it wele. For Lambert afore had lerned
this wyse lesson of Salomon. Ne respō
                  deas
stulto iuxta stulticiamsuam &c. Answere
not a fole accordinge to his folyshnesnesse / 
least thu apere lyke to him. He considered

also that his master Iesus Christ had
verye fewe wordes before Annas and Cayphas / 
and non at all before Herode / least he
shuld haue geuen that was holye to dogges
and that was preciouse vnto swyne.

you iudge him which haue no iudgement
that is godlye / whyls Christ hath promised
him a plentuouse reward in heauē for
that he suffreth here of yow. Saint Paule
saith that the worde of the crosse is euermore
iudged folyshnesse to them that shall perishe.
But vnto them that shall be saued it
is y• power of God. In that he was iudged
by the law at your procuremēt / he hath that

that he his selfe had afore. If they haue persecuted

No lesse rewarde hath Iohan Lambert
(as I beleue) for sufferinge yowr violence at
London / than had Antipas the faithfull
wytnesse of y• lorde which was cruellye slayne
at Pergamos. For that stronge victorye
which he had ouer yow / not beinge ouercomen
in his faithe by the terrour of deathe wt
yow procured him / he hath now of his lorde

God that swete Manna which is hydde frō
the wyse of this worlde / & that fayre whight
Stone which hath the newe name writen
that no manne knoweth saue he that receyueth
it.
               3 A great sort of your shorne generacion

                     •
                  o ere drawne to the gallowes in the seconde
yeare of kynge henrye the forth / and now in
owr tyme also for betrayenge this realme
to the Pope as I haue tolde you afore / but
at them ye triumphe nothinge at all. Fryre
Iohan forest a wyse prelate of yowrs was
both hanged and brent for heresye and treason / 
yet is he non of your Genealogye. The
marques of E
                     •
                  etur / the lorde Moūtegue / 
sir Edwarde neuele / sir Adryan foscue / & a
great nombre of trayters more / suffred deathe
openlye / yet are they not here remēbred.
But easye it is the cause to coniecture / for
they were your fryndes. They dyed for the
lybertees of your whorishe churche / as ded
your holy trayter Thomas Becket / to mainteyne
ye in all pryde and voluptuousnesse.
ye knowe what ye do wele ynough / though / 
ye be not all with the godlye wysest. yowr
quarell in this iest is onlye ageynst heretyques / 
speciallye ageynst soche as hath deminisshed
your lyuīges. As this Lambert was
one / whom here ye repart to be burned for heresye / 
not yll apayed therof. To them that
are brent for Christes veritees sake / remayneth
the same crowne of rightousnesse / that

remayned vnto Polycarpus the Bisshop of
Smyrna / which was also brent for the same
for whan the ryghtfull iudge shall come at
the latter daye / that now semeth ryght in
youre eyes will than apere otherwyse. Nothynge
shall there be decysed after youre popishe
lawes / but all accordynge to that worde
whom ye now condemne for heresye.
               4 For a custome in a maner ye take it / falselye
to allege youre scripturs. And to amende
the matter ye haue made it false Latine / 
wherby I iudge you but a sengle syr Iohan.
ye occupye here the feminyne gendre for the
masculyne. I suppose it is for some good loue
ye beare to that gendre out of the ryght rewle.
If these fawtes had bene but in one of
youre coppyes / we myght haue thought it
the printers neglygence. But now we are cō
                  pelled
to iudge it youre ignoraunce. Confusi sunt
sapientes / is not in the .iii. chapter of
Hieremie / but in the .viii. And it is there spoken
of those prestes and preachers / which
ministreth vnto the people lyenge lernynge
for lucre. For it foloweth immediatly after / 
Verbum enim Domini proiecerunt / & sapiē
                  tia
nulla est in eis. The worde of the Lorde
haue they throwne at their tayles / and haue
now no maner of wysdome. Their rebuke
(sayth the prophete) is open / for they do abhominable
thynges / yet are they not ashamed.
No / they will knowe of no maner of shame.
If this be not spoken of youre fylthye generacion / 

I report me to you. ye wolde fayne
haue it serue for Frith & Lambert. As who
shuld saye: They were confounded of youre
bisshoppes for all their wysdome. No / no / 
youre bisshoppes are confounded by them / 
though the worldlye eyes seyth it not. And
they are departed hence with victorye in
the veryte.
            
            
               
                  
                     A mysterye.
                     1 Next after him
Came in a lymme.
                     2 Of Antichrist
An Anabaptyst.
                     3 One Peter Franke.
                     4 Hi sunt fontes sine aqua, quibus caligo
tenebrarum reseruatur. 2. Pet. 2.
                  
¶The openinge. 1.
               YMagyne yow neuer so manye craftye
colours / yet can ye not hyde a wolfe.
Now couple ye these good menne with
the Anabaptistes / y• more to blemishe their
names / though they neuer agreed to that supersticyouse
secte. Rather shuld the Anabaptistes
seme to be of youre sorte than of theirs
For they haue in a maner the same opinion
of fre will / & of iustificacion by workes that
you haue. They will obeye no temporall magistrates / 
and nomore will you but by compulsyon.
They force not to breake their othe

of allegeaunce / & nomore do you. They wolde
haue all mennes goodes in common / & so
wolde you also / youre owne alwayes excepted.
And this foredele of them ye haue in
that article. ye are sure in euery mānes goodes
to haue a porcion by tyttle of tythes / offerynges / 
confessions / testaments / masses / 
& so forth / doynge lyttle or nothynge for it / 
and so are not they. And therfore I can not
se / but ye are a membre of theirs / as daungerouse / 
coyeshe / and diuerse as ye make it.
Marrye in dede a zele they haue vnto the
Gospell / thoughe nothynge to knowlege / 
which yow neuer had yet / but a most bytter
hate in the stede therof. And therfore ye seme
rather to be lymmes of the denyll (which
hath bene a murtherer in youre spyghtfull
generacion euer sens the beginnynge) than
of anye congregacion that is godlye.
               2 If ye knewe so wele what an Antichrist
were as ye can name him / ye shuld here plucke
youre selfe by the nose harde. But I perseyue
wele now ye are but a wytlesse fole. It
is not y• 
                  
                     •
                  ebaptisynge or retynctynge agayne
in water that maketh an Antichrist / but the
obstinate resistaunce of that heauenlye veryte
which Christ ones taught. He is a verye
Antichrist which vndre Christes tyttle
playeth a part cleane contrarye to Christ.
As where as Christ was meke / gentyll / sowlye / 
mercyfull / peceable / poore / pytefull / iust
and true. He is cruell / ferce / frowarde / frantyck / 

tyrannouse / proude / vaynegloriouse / 
spyghtfull / wycked / and false / and yet is all
done in Christes stede what blasphemye so
euer he worketh. Antichrist after y• scripturs
is he which calleth himselfe holye / changeth
y• lawes / obserueth dayes and tymes / 
doth manye false miracles / denyeth Christ / 
destroyeth peoples / woundeth vnto death / 
assoyleth for monye / iudgeth euyll good
and good euyll / is worshypped of Princes / 
burneth in concupiscence / and shall be destroyed
with the onlye breath of Gods mouthe.
Now blowe in both youre fystes / & tell
me whom they meane. ye knowe I am sure

                     〈◊〉
                   they are which worketh all these feates / 
els are ye a manne of verye small experience.
But here perauenture ye playe Tom
Nytygo. ye knowe it / but ye will not be acknowne
of it.
               3 To assertayne yowe fullye of the matter / 
the great Antichrist is youre whole clergye
with the layte of the same false faythe.
Of the which youre holye father the Pope
with his college of cardinals is the head / 
All Patriarkes / Archebishoppes / metropolytanes / 
bisshoppes / lawers / doctors / prestes / 
presones / curates / monkes / chanons / 
and nonnes are the bodye / & the .iiii. orders
of fryers which came last of all are the tayle
that couereth his arse / which is now cutt of
in Englande / and therfore he is there become
a curtall. This is the great bodye of sathan

which ministreth to the worlde all fylthynesse
of ydolatrie and necrolatrie. What
Peter Franke was by his lyfe (whom ye call
here a lymme of Antichrist) I can not iustlye
report / for he was of an other nacyon. But yf
that mannes lyfe maye be called good / whose
ende is godlye and perfyght / I dare boldelye
saye that his lyfe was good. For in his
death confessed he the Lorde Iesus Christ
to be his onlye sauer and redemer / which is
the true seale marke of the seruaunt of God.
In the myddes of the fyre also he stode withoute
feare / sorowe / tremblynge / changynge
of countenaūce / or dissolute mouyng: which
were playne tokens of a conscience not trobled / 
but assertayned throughlye of a moche
better lyfe after this lyfe. This lerned I in
Colchestre of them which were by his onlye
deathe or pacient sufferaūce / cōuerted from
youre papisme vnto true repentaunce / where
as nothynge afore coude conuert them.
               4 A verye theues part haue ye played here
with the text / which ye haue taken out of
saint Peters seconde epistle. Hi sunt fontes
sine aqua / quibus caligo tenebrarū reseruatur.
For ye haue left oute of it no lesse than
these .iiii. wordes / & nebule turbinibus exagitate.
These (saith saint Peter) are y• welles
without water / & clowdes carryed forth
with tempestes / to whom is reserued the myste
of darkenesse. This was neuer spoken
for anye that euer yet dyed for the veryte.

But for soche subtyle soth sayers as deceyue
the people / lyuinge here in all voluptuousnesse.
For thus beginneth the chapter. Fuerunt
pseudo Prophete in populo / s
                     •
                  cut & in
vob is erunt magistri mendaces. Amongest
the people were false prophetes / lyke as there
shall be amonge yow lyenge masters also.
These shall preuilye bringe in dampnable
sectes / denienge the verye lorde that
bought them. Manye will folowe their voluptuouse
wayes / by whom y• verite shall be
blasphemed. For couetousnesse shall they
with fayned wordes make merchaundyse
of you (saith he) but their iudgement is not
farre of / neyther slepeth their vtter dampnacion.
All this with moche more yet folowinge
of Balaam the false prophete / and of
Sodom and Gomor / is spokē of your fylthye
spiritualte / yf it be indifferentlye marked.
And therfor kepe it vnto yow as yowr owne
propre good / and turne it not vnto those poste
menne which haue no porcion therin.
            
            
               
                  
                     A mysterye.

That Christ and God.
Toke not manhode.

¶The openinge.
               
                  
ZElouse wolde this Poete fayne be seane
in his holye mothers quarell by y•
vyllenouse contempt of other. But
marke the ende of it. Whyls he rankelye accuseth
other menne of heresyes / he playeth
the ranke heretyque his selfe. He deuydeth
me here Christ and God by intermingling
a coniuncciō copulatiue / as though they were
.ii. and not one. Though Athanastus made
a difference of the godhede from the mā
                  hede / 
yet knyt he them togither in Christ.
But this rāke heretique Papist disseuereth
Christ from the godhede / so makinge owr ladye
the mother of .ii. chyldren. He willeth also
by this proposicion / that Christ beinge
manne a fore / shuld take his manhode with
God ageyne in Marye. Thus concludeth
he .iii. abhominable heresies in one. In this
had he nede to go to scole ageyne with his
great diuine / & sumwhat better to be taught
to declyne this matter. Ranker heresyes thā
these / were neuer taught of Marcion / Manes / 
Arrius / nor Eutices / the greatrest heretyques
of all. Therfor Pantolabꝰ maye wele
stande in the fore warde of heretyques / &
be first here of his owne Genealogye. But
he is sure to haue no harme of the Bysshoppes / 
for their smellinge serueth thē not that
waye. But se how true the promises of the
lorde are. He that layeth a snare shall fall
into it. Who stryketh with the swerde / shall
peryshe with the same. And he that iudgeth

his poore brother / condempneth himselfe.
Well / blessed / be the name of that lorde.
               2 The doctrine of these papystes haue
a great shyne of godlynesse / yet is it but fylthye
hypocresye. The blessed virgine Marye
which was the elect mother of Christ / 
detesteth soche fryuolouse and blasphemouse
bablinges as they geue vnto her. As that
she was without sinne in her concepcion / 
with soche other folysh fantasyes. Was not
her father a synner? was not her mother an
offender? Was she not brought forth in Adam?
Declined not she with all other? Had
she no nede of Christes sufferinges with other?
Though the papistes supersticiouslye
denye all this / yet doth she swete virgine afferme
it. My sowle (saith she) magnifyeth y•
lorde / and my spretereioyseth in God my sauer.
What neded he to haue bene her sauer / 
yf nothinge had bene in the waye to condēpnacion
ageinst her? Oh / blasphemouse here
tyques and excertable papystes / which thus
denye her the benefight of owr redempcion.
Christ came to saue synners onlye / and not
the arrogaunt rightouse / which had no nede
of hi. Lyke as ye are false iusti
                     •
                  iaryes / so
do ye bestowe your stodyes. She neuer couered
as yow do with the proude Pharise / not
to be as other menne are. But she was wele
contented to be of the common sort / to be exalted
vp from mekenesse. And as touchinge
Peter Franke that he shuld denye Christ to

take manhode of her / ye lye falselye of him.
He dyed in no soche wycked opinion as manye
haue crediblye reported. But sumthynge
ye must nedes laye for your selues / whan
ye haue done soche murther and mischefe.
               3 Full lyke a wyse clarke brynge ye forth
that text: Verbum caro factum est / the worde
became fleshe / and lyke a fleshlye gentylmanne.
I maruele where this clause was afore / 
that ye ioyned not God with Christe
therwith / but made them two by the vertue
of youre coniunccion copulatyue. ye do manye
madde miracles / whan ye come to youre
owne wyttes without the scripturs. In ipso
vita erat / sayth the Gospell afore. In that
worde was the lyfe and the lyght of menne.
But of that worde will you fatche no lyght / 
nor yet suffre other menne to fatche lyght
there / so farre as ye maye withstande yt.
They must fatche lyght at you / & yet ye are
those folyshe virgynes that Christ speaketh
of / whose lampes are oute / for ye are chast
geldynges all. ye are that folyshe fygge tree
which hath nothynge els but leaues. Whan
ye are in youre most pryde / ye shall wyther awaye
lyke a thynge of nought. It is not this
text that confuteth the vngodlye opinion of
the Anabaptistes. For all they beleue that
he became fleshe. But to proue that he toke
that fleshe of the virgyne / we must go vnto
the stronge promyses of God made vnto the
Serpent / to Abraham / and to Dauid. That

Sede of the woman (sayth the Lorde) shall
treade the on the head. In thy Sede (sayth
he to Abraham) shall all the kyndredes of y•
earthe be blessed. Blessed is the frute of thy
wombe / sayth the holye ghost in Elizabeth
to Marie: and so forth. That illius and that
Tui in the textes must be groundelye remembred / 
& than shall they not be able ones
to hysse at it.
            
            
               
                  
                     A mysterye.

¶The openynge. 1.
               BRagyngly styll brawleth this babler
and can fynde non ende of his insolent
madnesse. The mouthe of a wytlesse
nodye (saith Salomon) poureth out all
folyshnesse. The hart of a fole (saith Ecclesia
                     •
                  ticus)
is lyke a pott that is broken / for it
neuer retayneth wysdome. Here is now moche
matter agaynst Robert Barnes / and all
is not worth a nutt. Now cometh Pantolabus

in with his rhetoryckes of this & yrcey
                     •
                  
It is verye harde aborde with vs whan we
are dryuen to soche narrowe shyftes / that
we must nedes haue to make vp our meters / 
verelye / ywys / & certayne wt soch lyke. They
that are exercysed in makyng / wil iudge those
meters lowsye. But it is lernynge good
ynough for the gracelesse Papistes / lyke as
draffe is most fyt for swyne. The more folyshe
y• better for thē / & the more dawyshe it be
y• fytter it is for their grosse wyttes. No / they
will be non of these newe heretyques they.
The wysdome of this worlde hath taught
them an other lesson than so. They will slepe
in an whole skynne though they shuld to
the deuyll for their errours. Next after this
shall come in sumwhat / but I thyncke no
great wysdome into Pantolabꝰ brayne / vnlesse
he change from this frantycke frenesye
into some purpose godlye / and repent soche
willfull wodenesse. But I doubt verye moche
in that.
               2 I thynke in conscience that a blynder
beast than Pantolabus / is not this daye alyue.
If I had nothynge els / but these blynde
poesyes of his to beare me wytnesse / they
were sufficient ynough. For soche blynde
beggerye yet sawe I neuer / & so garnyshed
with the scripturs. O bloderynge Balaamites
which stodye nothynge els / but to prouoke
the people to folowe youre whoredome.
What Barnes was in the iuste quarell of

God agaynst youre blynde beastlye kyngedome
of Antichrist / we are not so blynde but
we knowe. And yf oure testimonye shulde
fayle / the workes which he compyled are
sufficient wytnesses to declare his godlye
wytt and lernynge / of the which we haue
seane more than .x. vndre diuerse tyttles.
So blynde is youre popishe generacion that
they neuer yet were able to answer one of
them. Which of you all with youre dyrtye
diuynite hath yet soluted but the least of his
argumentes in his boke of prestes matrymoney
or yet of the Masses abusyon? Naye / 
ye are non of those. It is ynough for you to
crye heretyque / heretyque / whan ye playe
nō other but an heretyques part yourselues.
Neuer are you good in Christen disputaciōs
but whan ye haue halters and fyre vpon
youre syde. Verye blynde Asses ye apere now
a dayes / for anye good lernynge ye shewe / 
& that is wele seane in the treatyse of Standys
                     •
                  e / 
in Bonners declaraciōs / and in this
worshypfull worke here of yours.
               3 I praye you hartelye what swete pathes
haue you founde out euer sens the yeare of
oure Lorde a M. and one? In the which yeare
was sathan youre great grandesyre sett at
large by youre holye father Pope Syluestre
y• seconde (which obtayned of him by Necromancye / 
to be saint Peters vycar) to worke
in the worlde all myschefe by you which are
his ryght fashyoned members. I thynke the

wayes are wonderfull / yf we shuld laye th
                     •
                  
out here togither. Neyther haue you spared
the nyght nor yet the daye to fynde out all
fylthynesse. Ded not you fynde out the worshippinge
of Images / the prayēge to rodes / 
the knelinge to ladyes / the kyssinge of relyques / 
the sensinge of aultres / and the sekinge
of shrynes / with soche lyke abhominacyons?
It is vnspekable what nombre of sowles
ye haue lost by these & soche other path
wayes of yours besydes your own wretched
sowles. This ded ye neuer yet recant / by
protestinge vnto your cures. Good people
we haue ledde ye wronge wayes by these vncommaunded
sacrifices & heythnishe worshippinges.
No / I dare boldelye saye before
God and manne / that ye neuer yet repented
it for all your oft goinge to confession / so farre
are ye from grace and all godlynesse. The
lorde of his great mercye delyuer ones his
people of that malignaūt generaciō of yours
For neuer shall they be but blinde / so longe
as they haue yow for their gydes.
               4 Here ye are not ashamed to accuse
good Doctor Barnes that right disciple of
Christ / that he neuer coude fynde the right
waye vnto Christes lore. As who shuld saye
the pathes that yow leade are the verye iust
wayes vnto Christes lore. And this do yow
write that the people shuld so beleue it. Lete
vs pondre yowr doinges vpon your most prī
                  cipall
feastes of the yeare / as vpon cristmas

daye / good frydaye / easter daye / and penthecost
day. And so se whether they be soche wayes
as Christ hath walked or no. For whye / 
those pathes which he hath gone afore / are
the onlye wayes to his lore. First ye haue euen
songe and compline in latyne withe the
sensinge of your aultres to beginne the solempnite
with / & these path wayes Christ
neuer knewe. The next daye folowinge ye
haue mattens / prime / & houres in the same
vnknowne language. ye haue holye water
makinge / procession / and hygh masse with
double sensinge of Images. ye haue at
nyght ageyne euensonge and cōpline with
sensinges. With these abhominable wayes
and soche other was Christ yet neuer acquainted.
But he demaundeth of yow this question
by his holye sprete in Esaye / who hath
required these thinges at yowr handes? Cō
                  cludinge
with you / that his wayes are not
your wayes nor yet his pathes. Therfor all
your pretensed colours are false here.
               5 Full true is the clause which ye haue
here alleged out of Salomons prouerbes / sauinge
onlye that ye haue changed the tyme
to come into the tyme present. Qui peruersi
cordis est / nō inuenit bonum / saye you. And
it is there. Non inueniet bonum. Who so
hath an hart geuen to mischefe / shall in the
conclusion wine no profight therbye. I maruele
ye toke not with it the clause next folowinge.

Lykewyse he that hath an ouerwhart
tonge / shal come to a myschefe. This myght
haue bene a premonishment for you / that ye
shuld not thus haue raged to youre owne cō
                  fusyon.
Of a wonderfull nature are the scripturs / 
that they neuer will serue you vnlesse
they be peruerted / mangled / & spoyled of
sumwhat. This text here alleged agreeth
better with no manne than with you. For I
thynke the deuyll hath not a more peruerse
stomake than you haue as youre frutes here
declareth. I maruele ye marked not this in
the chapter afore. He that disdayneth the
poore / blasphemeth him that made him. And
he that is glad of an other mānes hurt / shall
neuer be vnponnished. Almost in the ende of
that chapter / is this text for Barnes. Preciosi
spiritus / vir eruditus. A preciouse sprete
hath he that is lerned / speciallye of God.
Though youre whole generacion denyeth
him this / yet is it knowne to the Christen
worlde by his godlye workes to youre vtter
confusyon and shame.

The openinge. 1.
               YDyotyshe and folyshe are youre poesyes
euermore and full of blasphemose
lyes. Malyciouslye accuse ye here
doctor Barnes of ambicion / which soughte
nothynge lesse than ambiciouslye to regne
after that maner of youre proude modye mustre.
Where as Ambicion is in his most pryde / 
there fynde ye no fawte with him. But
there ye worshyp him with cappe / legge / and
knee / and wolde kysse his arse to please him.
To currye fauell he shall be youre singular
good lorde / and a prelate most wyse and pregnaūt / 
though he haue nomore godlye wytt
than an ape. Thus at a tyme Ambicion shall
be youre God / and yet to rebuke an other / ye
can take him for a vyce. Oh vngodlye flatterer
and false glosynge hypocrite. Lerne
first to se that vyce / where it is most depelye
regnyng / and correcte it in yours selfe whan
ye playe soche an hypocrites part. For all
youre crepynge and crowchyng to soche ydolouse
shepeherdes / is for that swete Ambicion
whom youre hart so sore coueteth. And
as concernynge sedicions and scysmes. Not
one hath bene in Christendome notable these
D.CCC. yeares / but youre false generacion
hath bene therin the chefe doers / as all

the Chronicles mencioneth. What myschefe
ye ded ones in the cyte of London in kynge
Rychardes tyme the seconde abought an
horse lofe / it is shame yet to reherse / besydes
that ye haue wrought there & in other quarters
of Englande euer sens that tyme.
               2 He that doth speake the thynge that is
true and certayne / & without false colours
of cauteles doth vtter it in wordes playne / 
is moche better occupyed than euer were
you yet. For that which you haue taught in
the churche and yet do styll teache daylye / 
so but the verye doctryne of deuyls / so vncertayne
and vntrue as they are. Nothynge
els are youre histories of the Saintes but
fables / lyes / and fantasyes taken out of Legenda
aurea made by fryre Iames de voragine.
The promyses that ye make to the people
concernynge youre Masses / that some of
them shuld be wholsom for the poxe / somme
for the pestylence / somme for the ague / somme
for the headake / somme for y• f
                     •
                  wle euyll
and soche other / are false and abhominably
practysed of you to deceyue the simple for
moneye. And lyke wyse youre frydaye fastynges / 
ladyes psalters / and rosaryes / with bedes / 
primers / py
                     •
                  turs / candels / holye waxe
& other wytcherye more. Neuer are the swete
promyses of the Gospell made playne vnto
the people by you / but darkened euermore
with youre hypocrites gloses. Neyther will
ye entre into the kyngedome of God youreselues / 

nor yet suffre anye other that wolde
gladlye entre. All youre stodye is to vpholde
those mytred Mahometes the Bisshoppes
to maynteyne you styll in the kyngedome of
fleshlye ydelnesse. And for that ye care not
how manye Christen sowles ye murther.
               3 As connynge as ye make ye in fyndynge / 
ye shewe youre selfe here but a false and
a deceytfull sercher. ye saye first to Barnes
charge that he sowed sedicion. This is no
newe thynge in you / but an olde vsed practyse
in youre craftye generacion. Of sedicion
was Christ accused by the hyghe Prestes / 
yet caused they Barrabas that was the sedicion
worker and a murtherer also / by their
instaunt labour to be saued. Paule was complayned
of to the debyte Felix to be a commocion
maker / not without the false counsell
of the Bisshoppe Ananias / yet was he a
manne most peceable and godlye. Happye is
Robert Barnes therfore with them so to be
noted of. the same selfe sort. Playne are his
wordes good manne / in all the workes he
hath made / cōcernynge obediēce dewe both
to God and to his prince. In all his wrytynges
can not I fynde one clause of disobediē
                  ce
to eyther of them. Manifestlye declared
he his obedience towardes God / in that he
for his truthes sake forsoke all worldlye estimacion
that he myght 
                     •
                  ele haue had / & at
the latter ende gaue his lyfe for it also. And
as touchynge the kynges mageste / his large

supplycacion vnto him directed / is a sufficient
wtynesse therof towardes him / besydes
y• boke which he wrote vnto him in Latine
cōcernynge the lyues of the Romishe Popes.
But it will here after apete some other
obedience that Pantolabꝰ complayneth of / 
than eyther of these be.
               4 I perseyue by the circumstaunce of this
matter / that the holye obediēce which Pantolabꝰ
meaneth here / that coude not be founde
out of Barnes / smelleth towardes Rome.
For it is a spirituall obedience belongynge
onlye to his mother holye churche / which is
no congregacion of the lewde layte / but of
spirituall prelates / as his holye father the
Pope with all his college of carde makers / 
arche byteshepes / and byteshepes / dockers / 
presters / and currates. These are the hyghe
powers that he speaketh of here after / to
whom he wolde haue vs so sore bounde to be
obedient in peyne of deadlye synne / because
that his honorable mastershyp myght be loked
vpon also as a ryght worshypfull curat
                     •
                  
amonge them / concernynge his tythes
& offerynges. For it is an yll worlde whan
the people will not knowe their dewtye to h

                  lye
churche. A great decaye is it to their holye
mother that the cursynge sentence is gone.
This was the obediēce that doctor Barnes
coude neuer fynde in all the scripturs / 
& therfore meanes were sought out to haue
him brent for an heretyque without examinacion

of his articles. Where as yf he had
acknowledged this / he had bene styll a lyue.
Thus playe these Romishe gentylmenne / 
colle vndre the candelstick / cloynige vndre
craftye colours to clought vp their false kingedom
of deuyllishnesse ageyne yf it may be
The subtilte of the serpent is not yet all dead / 
but lyeth styll lurkinge in their generacion /

wordes of the whole sentence to serue his
false purpose. And to amende the matter he
noteth it the .vi. Chapter of Sapience / where
is it is not so / but the .vi. Chapter of Salomons
Prouerbes. His concordaunce there
deceyued him. For that onlye he sought
for this text and not the Byble. And thꝰ ly

ende doth not Pantalabus bringe in this
text here / but onlye to proue Barnes an apostata
for leauinge his fryres cote with y• Popes
obedience. And in this hath he shewed
himselfe here in his owne right colours / a
through Papyst in dede (I will not saye a rā
                  ke
traytour) to approue my coniecture afore.
Easye is it to se what lyeth in the hartes of
these pestilent poyseners of the people / whā
the forsakinge of a pylde frytes cote is so
wayghtye a matter with them yet styll. The
sequele of that Chapter ded not Pantolabꝰ
marke / for his owne amendement & others.
For he found it not in his cōcordaunce. Sex
sunt que odit Dominus / et septimum detestatue
anima eius. Sex thinges are there
which the lorde hateth / and the seuenth he
abhorreth without remedye. A proude loke
a dissemblinge tonge / handes shedinge innocent
blood / an hart Imageninge euill / fete
that are swyft to do myschefe / a false lyenge
wytnesse / and he that soweth discorde amonge
bretherne. In this clere myrrour he
might haue seane himselfe in the hate of
God / and a great sort more of his cumpany.

¶The openinge .1.
               MAlice hath so blinded this imprudēt
pratler / that he seyth not the waye
he goeth in. And though he doth se
it playne ynough yet doubteth he not the daungers
therof. And parauenture he nedeth
nor neyther. For the wynker of wyles and y•
seker out of subtyltees hath put him and his
companye in assuraunce / that though they
slyde a lytle in the darke / yet shall they catche
no scathe. For nought is it not that they
daunse attendaunce / plainge placebo with
Reynarde the foxe. At all tymes shall they
be redye to geue warninge / yf anye parell be
towardes their whelpes. Lete them do nothinge
els in the meane season / but se alwayes
that the people obeye the commaundement
of the high powers / meaninge by thē
the spiritual prelates. And that they beleue
as holye churche doth teache thē after the
olde customes of their aūciēt elders / for these
newe falshyoned wayes are nothinge worthe.
If any be busye with these newe bokes
ageynst those hygh powers / lete them cause
their sworne satellites to indite them of heresye.
Come they ones that wayes vndretheir
spirituall handes / they shall fynde lesse

ease of it than eyther thefe or murtherer.
Therfor it shall be mete at all houres & seasons
for him that will lyue in rest / to be obediēt
to these hygh powers / though he shuld
for their obedience vtterlye forsake God
and obeye the deuyll. For their obedience is
non other.
               2 A farre diuerse obedience is this frō
al other. For it bideth vnto sinne / as witnesseth
also the great wyse clarke Iohan Standishe
in his treatise of reporche ageīst Barnes.
And I beleue it wele / for their lawes / 
commaundementes / and customes / to whō
they wolde binde vs / are nothinge els but
fylthye Idolatrye & sinne. Agreinge with y•
sainge of Saint Paule. That is not of the
faithe which Christ hath taught / is wickednesse
and sinne. I wote that of a craft they

they mynde nothinge lesse / but vndre that

                  ctorite
of their whorishe churche. Whye
shuld Pantolabus els call Barnes here craftelye / 
an Apostata. That clause was not all
brought in for nought. The manne ment
sumwhat more thā he durst wele vtter. But
where as he doth scornefullye axe this question / 
what Barnes ded winne by so disobeinge
the holye fathers? I will answere it for
him / bycause he is now dead. He hath wonne
so moche as Christ promised him / which
set him a worke. That is / persecucion / enprisonment

and deathe. And trulye that was a
swete winninge / for therwith hath he wonne
also the lyfe euerlastinge. Who so euer
will saue his lyfe (saith Christ) shall lose it.
And he that shall lose his lyfe for my sake / 
shall fynde it ageyne in the lyfe euerlasting.
Saint Paule sayed boldelye vnto the Philippyanes
that deathe was vnto him a winninge.
And I knowe that the lyberall hande
of the lorde is not yet abreuiated.
               3 Now steppeth forth Pantolabꝰ as bragge
a bodye lowse / and as one depelye lerned
in y• scole of scornefulnesse / he soluteth his

                   wynne for not obeienge
holye churche / as though menne were ignoraunt
therof. He telleth them with so moche
spight as he can wele Imagine / that
Barnes was tyed to a poste in Smytfelde at
London with .ii. companions more / and that
he there ded roste. But he sayeth nothinge
(I trowe) of the Popes .iii. sworne chaplaynes
Powell / Abell / and fetherston his owne
swete companions which were the some daye
& houre in the same selfe smithfelde both
hanged and quartered for treason. No / that
disobedience toucheth not Pantolabus. I
tolde yow afore that he wolde at the last declare
vnto yow for all his craftye colours
what obediēce he ment. O holy Rome holy
Rome / thu spirituall Sodome and Egipt / 
moche beholden art thu to thy secrete louers

in Englande so workemāly to cloyne in thy
cause. As concerninge good Robert Barnes
whose ende is thought without honour of y•
daintye babes of this worlde. He is counted
amonge the dere children of God / and hath
his porcion with the saintes. Though he semeth
lost to y• vngodlye wise / yet resteth he
swetelye in the peace of the lorde. As golde
in the hote fyerye fornace tryeth he his electes / 
and as a brent offeringe receyueth thē

               4 Alwayes is Pantolabus lyke him wc tempted
Christ in the desart / whose Apostleship
he hath here deuoutlye taken vpō him.
Styll vseth he his olde roberyes and legerdemaynes
with the scripture. Here geueth
he vs a mangled texte of Saint Paule to
the Romanes / appointing vs the .viii. chapter
instede of the. xiii. If it be not honest
playe and cleane conueyaunce / I report me
to yow. Omnis anima potestatibus subdit

purpose. Lete euerye sowle (sayth he)
submit it selfe to the powrs / but the hyghar
powers he nameth not / least he shuld haue
mencioned the kynge / myndinge nothingelesse.
For he is the hygher power / and God
is y• hyghest of all. Powers without hygher
or hyghest are alwayes indifferent / & maye

be iudgled with / & therfor he putteth them
here for the Prelates of his churche. But
Saint Iohan sayth in the Apocalyps / that
their powers are of the Serpent / which gaue
his auctorite and seate to that beastlye
Antichrist of theirs. Whan Christ spake of
worldlye powers / he ernestlye charged his
Apostles to obeye them / but in no case to take
them vpon them. I wondre of the blyndenesse
of Pantolabus / that he perseyueth not
what foloweth in the same Chapter. Nemini
debeatis quicquam / nisi vt inuicem diliga
                     •
                  is.
Lete nothinge be donne amonge yow
but in mutuall loue / sayth Saint Paule. Lete
charite be the power that yow shall occupye / 
for that fulfylleth the lawe. If this power
regned in Prelates / and were so well
taught of them as it is commaunded / neyther
shuld the hygh powers haue so moche

murther / nor yet so many of their spirituall
swarme be whoremongers / murtherers / &
robbers of the common people as they are.

¶The openinge. 1.
               Excedinge hote and modye is this mā
                  ne
styll in his matters / and wyll not
haue done with Barnes yet for a lyttle.
He now describeth his standinge in the
fyre betwixt Garade and Hierom. But he
telleth not which of his own generacion hinge
that daye in the myddes / of powell / Abell
& fetherstō. No / that pleased him not so wele
as this. For these were fryndes to his holy
father of Rome / where as they were enemies.
His eye syght therfor serued him not so
wele vpon this syde as vpon that syde. The
Popes enemies are the onlye heretiques in
his Genealogye here / and not the enemyes
of Christ and his kynge. Be that farre from
him to iudge those good vertuouse fathers
of holye churche any heretyques. No / I warande
you / Cardinall Pole / fryre Peto / fryre
Buckenham / & other ranke papistes abrode / 
are yet non heretyques with him / but relygiouse
vpholders of that holye mother of his
the churche of Rome. Truthe it is that Thomas
Garade a bachelar of diuinite and person
of honye lane / was tyed to that poste vpon
his ryght syde / for preachinge ageynst
Antichrist. And that ded Christ afore tyme
promise hī in Peter for a rewarde / yf he wolde
be a preacher in his kyngedome. Whan
thu wert yonge (sayth he) thu gyrdedst thyselfe / 
& walkedst at thy pleasure. But whan
thu art olde / thu shalt streche forth thy handes / 

and an other shall gyrde the / leadynge
the contrarye to thy mynde. And therfore
this was vnto him a promysed rewarde of
his master / which had no better of the worlde
his selfe.
               2 If Garade were a brother of Barnes / 
of a lykelyhode he was non than of Pantolabꝰ
brotherhede / as were Abell & Powell.
For yf he were / he wolde nor regestre him
for an heretyque. But I putt the case that
Garade & Barnes both be now of that bretherhede
which God the father hath allowed
for his sonne Iesus sake / as it is most
lyke to be so. For that heretage in Christ is
not promysed vnto them which lyue here in
wanton pleasurs and are murtherers in cō
                  tempt
of the Christen veryte / but vnto those
despysed disciples that are persecuted &
scorned / and that suffre death for thesame.
What shall become than of Pantolabꝰ and
soche other disciples of Antichrist / which
hath with so villenouse spyght refused that
bretherhede / yt is easye to cōiecture / yf they
de
                     •
                  olye repent not in tyme. Happye is Thomas
Garade that euer he was borne. Not
onlye in that he taught Christ here for an
onlye sauer without the mangye merytes of
menne / but also in that he hath with his
owne dere lyfe / sealed as a sure wytnesse vnto
the same agaynst Antichrist. This singular
profyght hath he all redye gotten therby
That he shall from henceforth neyther honger

nor thirst / and that God hath wyped
awaye all teares from his eyes. Neuer more
shall he tast of death / of losses / nor yet of
sorowes / for the first sorowes are past. Now
is he sure to be allowed for a fre cytezen in
the newe Hierusalem / whan his lorde shall
sytt in the regeneracion.
               3 Pantolabus yet styll to conferme his
doctryne with blasphemyes and lyes / allegeth
here the .xvii. chapter of Ecclesiastes / 
otherwyse called the preacher / and the whole

which was a ryght brother of hi

                  atlye vpon them / but holye
churches matters are an other maner of

                  t forth his owne

a bachelar of diuynite also / & a manne eloquentlye
lerned / for the veryte preachynge
agaynst Antichrist / stode on the leftehande
of Barnes in the fyre and was brent with
him to ashes. And blessed is he that euer he
had a lyfe so to bestowe agaynst that abhominable
kyngdome of yours. That fyre was
vnto him but a delyueraunce from miseries / 
restorynge his sowle to that quyet which he
hath now in Christ Iesu. Not the more vnpure
was that offred vp treasure which the
lorde left with him in an carth

them by his holye worde & promyse.
               2 To enlarge his poesyes with some blynde
thetoryckes / he sheweth that Wyllyam
Hierome was one of that nest. But what
that nest is / he declareth not / but leaueth it
all blynde / as he is alwayes a blynde leader.
A nest in the scripturs hath both a good origynall
and a godlye significacion / though

Pantolabus here mocketh with it for want
of good lerninge. By the wysdome & apointment
of God was it first fashioned / & sumtyme
it betokeneth the true churche / sumtyme
the conscience of manne. The false counterfet
churche which Pantolabus here mainteyneth / 
is no wholsom nest in dede / but y•
insaciable chaos or bottomlesse pyt that S.
Iohan speaketh of / whiche hath darkened
the sunne that is Gods worde / and sendeth
forth nothinge els but a fylthie smoke of tradicions
& of mennes lowsye lerninge with
an innumerable swarme of their lecherouse
locustes. As are mytred Byshopes / Gorgio

call a man blynde / than he that is blinde
all togither? Of all that Pantolabꝰ hath
here taught in this Genealogye / is not one
scripture trulye applyed nor yet after anye
honest sort declared. But as a blinde sorgeon
or dogge leche / he hath turned it all into
one blynde eyesalue to blynde menne all togither.
True is it in him that Saint Iohan
ded saye. Though the lyght doth shyne in
the darkenesse / yet wyll not the darkenesse

Barnes and his companye / shewinge
vs hete that all they thre are burned. And
not a lyttle glad is he and his generation
therof / for so moche as they thre ded them so

cost them no small stodye to bringe it to passe / 
nor yet small diligence and labour to haue

it a sowle displeasure / for so moche as there
were the same selfe daye & houre .iii. mightye
captaynes of their holy assemblye / hanged

hanged. For helpinge downe his
kingedom was Barnes / Garade / and Hierome
burned. Fortunate are they which suffred
for Christ / for their rewarde is sayed
forth in the scripturs and promises of the lorde.
For the other is there neyther scripture
nor promise. Though they were most greuouslye
tormented before menne / yet was their
hope full of immortalyte which now they fele
ineffect. Their sowles are now in the hā

               OVt of no small charite aryseth this
feare of Pantolabus / least anye more
shuld come to the ende of Barnes / 
or be brent in the fyre as he was. yea / so brotherlye

so moche Christen loue / that he wolde not

               2 Moche doubt hath Pantolabꝰ for this

it as hath anye other ranke Papist of

the false kingedom of Antichrist

to all ryght iudgementes / and therfor
their deathes are gloriouse. The amendement
which Pantolabus requireth here / 
concerneth the obedience of that malygnaunt
mustre of those mitred mahoūdes / whō
he wolde in no wyse to decaye. But lete him
set his hart at rest / for the lorde is almost at
a point with that wretched wytcherye.
               3 Vnplesaūt euermore are the scripturs
to Pantolabꝰ / and that apereth wele by his
monstruouse handelynge of them. Here bringeth
he in to cōferme his purpose / a ragged
patche out of the first chapter of Ecclesiastes
otherwyse called the preacher / but not
as it is there spokē. For here it is / Vix corriguntur

is it (sayth he) to make the croked strayght / 
or the frowarde wele disposed. Parauenture
he hath made this alteracion here to shewe

This therfore is non of youre seuen deadlye

               3 Nothynge agreeth this that foloweth

that is a sleper beareth no fayre face a brode
so longe as he is a sleper. Neyther is he seane

Wherfore these rhetorycall poesyes of Pantolabus

He shuld apere a moche better Poete / wolde
he ones leaue the companye of dame ignoraunce.
Trulye she is manye tymes to nygh
his elbowe whan he setteth his penne to the
boke. Lyke as she is also with Doctor yncke
pott otherwyse called Iohan Standyshe.
A fayre face hath youre holye mother y• churche
of Antichrist borne outwardlye in euery
place / with copes / crosses / ceremonyes / and
sensynges. yet doth the scripturs call her a
verye whore and the Synagoge of sathan.
And that fayre face of hers was first represented
as a preuyall signe / in him which
was the first head of the Rome churche by
the permissyon of Phocas the false emprour
For his name at that tyme was Bonifaciꝰ / 
which is as moche to saye as bona facies / a
good face or a glosynge pretence of counterfett
holynesse. The dowter of a mourthere
                     •
                  
is that holye mother of yours / therfore must

she be geuen to murther of verye nature.
For Phocas trayterouslye slewe his master
Mauricius which was the Emprour afore
him / & so entered into his rowme. In token
that she shuld destroye the Empyre / & mayntayne
her estate by murther.
               4 I thynke verelye that Pantolabꝰ will

that they shulde alwayes haue the worlde
an aduersarye. And that they shulde loke
for non other frutes of gentylnesse therof / 
but scornefull rebukes and slaunders. In cō
                  fyrmacion
of this / Saynt Iohan sayth also
in his reuelacion / that as the true preachers
hath at anye tyme fynyshed their faythfull
testimonye or massage / the beast that came

out of the bottomlesse pyt (which is the great
bodye of Sathan or swarme of Antichristes
broode) shuld euermore make warre ageynst

                  cerninge

alwayes inuincible. Here doth Pantolabus
(which is a maliciouse membre of the same
mad mustre) report the true seruauntes of y•
lorde to be verie frowarde in opinion & full
vntowarde in faithe to his mynde. They be
leue not the newe articles which his holye
churche hath taught of Saintes / Images /

people with knowlege from aboue / which

wherin is nothinge els but dampnacion.
               2 As a naturall membre of the afore named
bodye of Sathan / doth Pantolabus shewe
himselfe here. For lyke as the seyd Sathan
accused Iob before the lorde / and hath
bene euer sens an accuser of owr bretherne
in his members / so doth Pantalabus nowe
accuse them also / as one naturallye geuē vnto
the same feate. They are as frowarde (sayth
he) ageynst holye churche / and as vntowarde
to do anye thinge to her commodite / 
as the other sort / that is to saye / frith / Lambert

Barnes / and soche other were afore / of
whom ye haue harde here in this worshypfull
Genealogye. Of them in dede we haue
harde sufficientlye that they coude in no wyse
awaye with the whoredome of your holye
mother in her Idolatrouse ceremonies and
sacrifices. If these be now in the same selfe
takinge also / we haue cause moche to reioyce / 
and to geue hygh thankes vnto God so
to delyuer thier consciences from your Babilonishe
burdenes. It is a full manifest token
that his persecuted churche is not yet
all dead / but that he styll lyueth in his trobled
members according to his iust promes
and shall do to the ende of the worlde. For
the churche that is his dere spouse / is not
gloriouslye painted out to the worlde withe
golde / syluer / preciouse stone / & pearle. But
inwardlye decked with faythe / hope / charite / 
and the rightousnesse of Christ. And outwardlye
she is adourned with calamitees /

                  acions / most slaunderouse rebukes / and
deathe.
               3 Glad are we to heare it / that the ernest
sprete of Christ is not yet extinguished
in them for all yowr most cruell assaultes of
penaltees / inprisonmentes / famishemētes / 
halters / swerdes / faggottes / fryre / and all
other tormentes els. A remnaūt is there yet
lest of them which hath not bowed their knees
to yowr false God Baal. To them hath
the lorde promised a crowne of lyfe / yf they

perseuer stedefast to the ende. For these do
we praye dayly with teares wt are a brode in

                     •
                   / that they do not swetue from that stedefast
rocke at the venemouse suggestions
of your fylthye generacion / as some fleshly
wantons hath done now of late to their sowles
detriment. Better had it bene for them
that they neuer had geuen that is holye to
dogges and swyne after Christes premonishementes / 
than thus shamefullye to become
swyne with them and so to treade his preciouse
pearles vndre their fete. For in so denienge
the lordes verite before menne / they
haue shewed themselues what they are / euē
the flesshlye louers of themselues / and vnworthye
of Christ. More harme haue they
done than they which hyd the lordes treasure / 
neuer openinge their mouthes to declare
it. Those are they which are neyther hote
nor colde / whom the lorde hath promised
to spewe out of his mouthe / or vtterlye to reiect
them from the eternall her

clerlye racinge their names out of the boke

               4 If those good creaturs (whom Pātolabꝰ
here spyghtfullye reporteth) cleaneth fast
vnto their bone / we are greatlye ioyfull therof.
For a more manifest token cā not be that
they are Christes members than that. By
that inseperable saythe apere they to be his
naturall spouse in dede / a bone of his bones
and a rybbe of his rybbes. Now are they by

that meanes become his own dere mēbers / 
his misticall fleshe and bodye. He that shall
now persecute them / shall persecute the apple
of his eye / so dere and preciouse are they
vnto him. For their faithfull perseueraūce
make we daylye intercessions with teares
from our hartes / which are now dispersed or
scattred abrode in the regions of Samaria
and Iudea / for the persecuciō that is at Hierusalē.
With the wiges that the lorde hath
graciouslye geuē vs which are his wordes
and examples ded we flye into the wyldernesse / 
so sone as we perseyued that the rode

                   by his worde▪ ye shall be
persecuted (saith Christ) from cyte to cyte.
For yf they haue persecuted me / they shall
also persecute you. But as they shall pursue
yow in one cyte / flee yow alwayes into an other.
Not onlye was this Christes counsell
but he ded it also in effect. He fledde into
Egypt in his yowthe / he declyned from the
malice of his enemies / and he absented himselfe
from the Iewes. In that wyldernesse
hath he prepared for vs as he ded for Helias
to fede vs there for the space of a thousande

cause all Englyshe menne to abhorre Christes

Not onlye doth he leaue them vnrebuked
of verye tendre sauer and loue / but also
full fatherlye he mainteyneth them with y•
lordelye wages of his seruauntes / and sumtyme
with the delycates of his owne table

beniu

                  lence of his / is for some respect

that he hath to the common welthe / or

howsholde / which euerye where tosseth lyke
termagauntes with the blood of oure lorde / 
the sowle / the hart / the fleshe / the bodye / the
bones. This is the holye Gospell that he
maynteyneth. Blynde are they called here
of Pantolabus / which will not folowe these
vertuouse rewles to the vpholdynge of their
markett in confessyons at lent. But the eternall
father delyuer his flocke from the abhominable
blyndenesse of them.
               2 Non can ryghtlye se after the blynde
opinion of Pantolabus / vnlesse they be ledde
blyndefelde in the darke / by the sprete of
his holye mother. She must sett vpon their
noses y• spotted specularyes of her olde tradicions
and customes / or els is yt nothynge
worth. If they shulde be now without their
Latine houres (wherwith neuer manne yet
was Christenlye edifyed) their Christen relygyon
were clerelye lost. If they shuld not
haue their accustomed wainlynges in the
temple / their processionynges / their sensynges / 
their holye water swyngynges with soche
other ioyes of olde Troye / they wolde
thynke that heauen were out of the worlde
and hell comen home to their dores. This is
the syght that Pantolabus requyreth / non
other wolde he the people to haue / least they
shulde in a whyle be moche godlyar wyse
than he. This houglye syght despysed Iohan

Wyclef and Iohan Husse. This fylthye
syght contempned Mariyne Luther &
Melanchton. It was nothynge for the appetyte
of Oecolampadius and zwinglius / 
with soche other more. And that is the verye
cause whye they are regestred here of Pantolabus
for heretyques. These are they that
were blynde afore / because they had not that
syght of his holye mother. And they which
cometh after kepeth now yet styl in store the
same selfe blyndenesse in his folyshe opinion / 
and therfore he is not contented with
them / but wolde verye fayne haue them burned
for heretyques yf yt myght be.
               3 Afore grefe is yt to the stomake of Pantolabus / 
that anye shulde be alyue which
fauoreth not the Pope. This parauenture
will be rekened a slaundre / but the denyll of
lye yt is. What other is yt but to preferre a
manne / whan we magnifye his workes? Are
anye other thynges called vpon here than
matters of Papistrye? No verelye. Not one
poynt is sought here of Christes clere institucion.
Neyther his holye Supper nor Baptym / 
compassion of y• poore nor mutuall charyte / 
nor yet the true preachynge of repentaunce
by the Gospell of saluacion. But here
seketh Pantolabus with all power possyble
to holde vp Antichristes kyngedome for
fallynge / and that with the most spyghtfull

                     •
                  omempt of his Christen bretherne which
is but a fylthye buyldynge. For more enclynynge

to Christes clere veryte than to their
vnwolsom Papistye / he accuseth them here
most malyciouslye of preuye vpstorynge and
close enclosynge togyther of cankred heresye.
As though the Gospell of y• lorde (which
they haue receyued as his onlye power to
saue them) were most cankred and pestylent
heresye. Thus do they to cause the people to
abhore yt / and to brynge the worlde in an
yll opinion of them that oweth yt fauer. Non
other is the nature of soche execrable lo
                     •
                  ustes / 
which are crept out of the smoke of the

the earth. All that hath receyued anye quyekenesse
of beleue by the worde of the lyuynge
Lorde / wolde they wyther vp to the fyer
of hell.
               4 True is the clause of Ecclesiastes that
Pantolabus here allegeth for a full confirmacion
of his matter / yf yt were trulye bestowed.
Stultorum infinitus est numerus.
Of foles is there an infynite noumbre or an
innumerable sort. This was not spoken for
the small flocke of Christes persecuted members / 
whom the worlde reputeth for foles / 
for they are but fewe in nombre. Manye are
called (sayth he) but verye fewe are chosen.
But this was first vttered for that pleasaūtlye
disposed multitude of this worlde / whō
God hath reputed / and styll doth yet repute
foles in his scripturs, The noumbre of those

foles are infynite in dede / and their swarme
innumerable. Of his faythfull seruauntes
doth the Lorde knowe the noumbre / for he
hath their names wrytten in the boke of lyfe.
But of these ruffelynge rutters he knoweth
no noumbre / for his knowlege most cō
                  monlye
is his acceptacion / which they shall
neuer enioye. Wysdome had yt bene for Pantolabus
to haue consydered this text there
also. Vidi cunc
                     •
                  a que fiunt sub sole. Et ecce
vniuersa vanitas & afflictio spiritus. I behelde
all thynges (sayth the wyse manne)
done vndre the sunne. And I perceyued wele
they were all but vanyte and vexacion of
mynde. By this myght he haue consydered / 
what his folyshe Papistrye is / not rysynge
of the expresse worde and commaundment
of God / but of the syckle fantasyes of men.
That yt is but mere vanyte and madnesse / 
and that the obseruacion therof is execrable
fylthynesse.

                  ions for his

Blessed are your (sayth he) whan mēne
reuyle yow / and falselye report yow for my

heauen. A moche better waye therfore were
yt for Pantolabus and for his bloodthurstye
generacion / to leaue their murtherynge vp
of innocentes / and to repent from the hart
their manyfolde myscheues past. And that
ones done / than to praye vnto the Lorde in
faythe / to withdrawe from them that vengeaunce
of innocent blood she dynge which
hangeth ouer their heades as a perpetuall
plage / rodde / or scourge of eternall dam

                  nacion.
Thus doynge they myght beccome of publycanes

true Apostles with Matthew / & of
cruell murtherers faythfull minysters with
Paule the elect vessell of God.
               2 Charytable wolde Pantolabus gladlye
apere / now that he hath spewed out all his
poyson and myschefe agaynst y• true seruaū
                  tes
of God. A fayre colour sett they alwaye
                     •
                  
vpon the matter / be their workynges neuer
so vengeable. And in that they agre with
their spirituall head the serpent / which temptynge
Eua / shewed a bewtyfull face outwardlye
with swete and pleasaunt wordes.
Whan they sytt in their consistoryes vpon
condempnacion of the innocētes with Cayphas / 
they outwardlye pretende all godlynesse.
They first call vpon the name of God
openly protestyng that they haue his ryght
honour before their eyes in all that they go
abought. They sweare also vpon the holye
Euangelyes / that they will there do nothynge
of displeasure / hate / percyalyte / nor malyce.
Yet is the poore innocent in the ende cō
                  dempned / 
accursed / geuen to the deuyll / disgraded / 
fyered / and burned / onlye for his
fayth in the Lorde Iesus Christ. Neuer the
more is Pantolabus here to be trusted / that
he prayeth so bytterlye for their conuersyon.
For abhomynable is that charyte which foloweth
of so moche malyce as he hath afore
here vttered / and that apereth by the fylthye
frutes therof. Not vnto Christ and his
holye verytees wolde he haue them here

with all their hartes to conuert / but vnto
the Antichrist of Rome by a newe obedience
of his olde cankred customes whō their lorde
God doth detest and abhorre. This is y•
dissemblynge charite of this worme of way
wardnesse or maliciouse membre of Sathā.
This is the conclusion he seketh.
               3 Fayne wolde Pantolabus haue them
to conuert to that false obedience of Antichrist / 
that he might lyue lyke a gentylman
and haue his dishes the fatter / and his purse
the waghtyer. Oh / it is a pleasaunt thinge
to haue the people on both sydes of the way
salutinge them with cappe and knee. It is
a good syght / (saye they) whan the flocke foloweth
the shepeherde / and y• parryshynes
their curate. yea / but alas what is it whan
the lambes folowe the wolfe / which is a cruell
thefe / a destroyer / and a murtherer? For
whose grace wolde Pantolabus haue Christen
menne to call? For the grace of holye
churche / of his holye father the Pope / of his
good lorde of Wynchestre / his good lorde of
London. His good lordes of lyncolne / yorke
and Durham / with soche other ghostlye fathers.
If he meaneth the grace of God / I
maruele that he forgetteth himselfe & his
owne generacion. Me thinketh they ought
in soche prayer / to be had most in remembraunce / 
consideringe they are fardest of all mē
                  ne
frō his grace. yf they seke not for it whil
                     •
                  
they haue here space and layser / it wyll be
wyde with them whan they shall come ones

to their strayght reakininge. But they thynke
it safe ynough / so longe as they haue y• Popes
powr still in their handes / wt / Ego absoluote
vndre a stulticia a stole I shuld saye.
For yf they maye geue grace vnto others / 
they haue grace ynough for themselues / &
so haue lyttle nede of Gods grace.
               4 Manye a manne (they saye) shall vttre
the thinge which he vnderstandeth not / 
lyke as Pantolabus doth here. And as we
haue for example of Balaam / kynge Saul / 
Cayphas / and Pylate / whiche prophecyed
they knewe not what. Dum lucem habetis
(sayth he) credite in lucem / vt filii lucis sitis.
Whyle ye haue the lyght / beleue on the
lyght / that ye maye be the chydren of lyght.
This hath he borowed of the. xii. Chapter
of Iohā to clought vp his matter / yet doth
he not knowe what it meaneth. For yf he
ded he wolde not persecute that lyght as he
hath done here most spight fully. The light
that is there mentioned is the lordes eternall
worde / which Pantolabus with soche
other craftye cloyners calleth heresye / and
wolde haue the people so to esteme it. But y•
lyght that he wolde haue thē to beleue / is y•
faythe of his holy mother with y• olde croked
customes of her Papistrye / and that is no
lyght but darkenesse most dampnable. Omnis
qui credit in me / in tenebris non mane
                     •
                  .
Non that beleueth in me (sayth Christ in y•
same selfe Chapter) abydeth in that darkenesse / 
meaninge therbye the doctrine of hypocresye

or of outwarde obseru
                     •
                  cions inuented
by mēne. This promised he there to cast
out with the prince of this worlde / by the
mightye aperaunce of his worde / whiche
shuld iudge those infidels also at the latter
daye. The cause whye they se not this light
nor beholde the misteryes therof / is that he
hath blynded their eyes and hardened their
hartes for their vnbeleues sake least they
shuld be saued.

But euermore is he mercifull / whā

¶The openinge. 1.
               LAst of all now cometh Pantolabus in 
                     •
                  
his humble requestes / as lowlye as the
foxe whan he seketh his praye / and as
false as the fryre whan he stodieth to deceyue.
But marke his rhetoricall style / how manerlye
it passeth here. Wherin (sayth he) I
requyre. That is to saye / in that stinkinge

heresye (for that goeth inmediatlye afore) to
praye for the kynge. Is not this (thinke you)
full workemanlye handled and lyke a pregnaunt
Poete of the Popes pultrye / thus to
regestre his kynge in the Genealogye of stinkinge
heresye as he calleth it. And to desyre
his subiectes to praye for hī in y• same stiking
heresye also? Abhominable is that prayer / 
whiche riseth out of so stinkinge a desyre.
Is not Pantolabus (suppose ye) a pure handed
artyficer and a cleane fyngered gentylmanne / 
that so can polyshe his poesyes? yes
verelye is he / and lyke one of the scole that
he cometh from. In the mart that he occupyeth / 
shall ye fynde nonother wares. All that
is there done / commeth out of stinkinge heresye / 
yf antichrist their Pope be an heretyque.
For all that they do in their churche as
yet / are his dyrtye leauinges / not one obseruacion
bournisshed with the verite of the
lorde. If Pantolabus hath no better thinge
to bestowe vpon his kynge but a prayer made
out of stinkinge heresye / it were best for
hi to kepe it styll vnto himselfe. For he hath
no nede of that curse of God / for all their
blessinges are curses / and their prayers synne
after Malachias Prophecye.
               2 Certayne / verelye / and ywys cometh
neuer into owr meters / but whan we lacke
matter and wytt to fulfyll them / as I tolde
yow afore. ywys master Pantolabus the great
grounded poete of the Popes greasye grauell

pyttes / requireth all menne that shall
reade with a good deuocion to Antichrist / 
this Genealogye of stinkige heresye (which
he hath of an ydle Idyotes brayne compyled
to pondre his good zele vnto holye churche / 
& to praye for the kynge whan they may
wele intende it. For it is no gret good deuocion
that here moueth him vnto prayer that
waye / but that he must nedes saye sumwhat
though it were but for maner sake. Great
pyte were it but the manne shuld desyre to
haue readers of his worke / it is so notable.
As full is it of good Christen erudicion / as
a dogges date is full of swete honye. How
shuld they be stinkinge heretyques / styff necked
scysmatyques / and obstynate Papistes / 
yf they shuld not reade soche pratye Poesyes
amonge. Lete no manne thinke other wyse
but that Pantolabus and soche other intē
                  deth
sumwhat by soche subtyle workemanshippe.
The Bisshopes winketh at it / as
though there were in it non heresye / whan
it is all stinkinge heresye by their owne confession.
They are wele contented whā they
playe soch bussye partes / and wyll not be acknowe
of it / but leteth them alone. If anye
of them leape so farre that he is hanged vp
for treason / they care lyttle for it / for they
thinke thy haue so lost but a knaue.
               3 After a farre fett style / and curyouslye
compassed processe / cometh Pantolabus at
the last to his full desyre. Exhortynge all

menne to praye here for the kynge / with as
lyttle true deuocion as he that myndeth nothynge
lesse. And yt maketh no matter neyther.
For moche better yt is to be vnprayed
for / than to be prayed for out of stynkynge
heresye / as all their Papistrye is non other.
The prayer which ought to be made for kynges
& for them that are in auctoryte / ought
to aryse of the sacred scripturs whereof they
haue their auctorytees / and not out of s
                     •
                  ynkynge
heresye as yt is here requyred. Saynt
Paule exhorted Timothe / which was no
papistycall masse sayer but a preacher of the
Gospell sufferynge daylye persecucions for
the same / before all other thynges to praye
for kynges and for all other which were in
hyghe power / that Christes disciples and
true beleuers myght lyue vndre them a peaceable
lyfe in all godlynesse. And this is our
prayer also with contynuall teares. Wherin
we desyre the lorde for his eternall mercyes
sake / alwayes to preserue him. But oute of
stynkynge heresyes we praye not for him / 
neyther out of Mattenses nor Masses / euē
                  songes
nor complynes / which are the verye
frutes of the Beast of Rome / least we shulde
by those blasphemouse prayers brynge vpon
him the great indignacion of God. The frutes
are euermore all one with their tree in
goodnesse / as those fylthye obseruacions
with their first fylthye begynner / haue they
neuer so fayre colours of gods seruice / gods

The openinge. 1.
               ERnest is Pantolabus yet styll in requestes
sprynggynge out of his gentyll
Genealogye of stynkynge heresye.
For therin he homblye requyreth all
these thynges by his owne confessyon afore.
Herin he desyereth the dilygent readers of
his worke / to praye for the quene also / which
was sumtyme called the ladye kateryne howarde.
               
                  
He shulde seme to be some blynde
chaplayne of hers / by the blynde zele he sheweth
here. For he wolde haue her remembred
where so euer she go / in the waye or out
of the waye. Trulye that prayer were of a
straunge kynde / yf yt shuld so be made as yt
is here requyred. Who hath harde prayers
made for menne to go where they will / or
whan they are out of the ryght waye to contynue
so styll? I thynke fewe menne lyuynge
I wolde haue no soche querestre of Baals
quere / nor yet soche a chaplayne of Bels college
to praye forme / as poore a man as I am
Moche better grace parauenture had bene
hers / yf she had chaunced of no soche ghostlye
fathers. For where as the scripturs are / 
contempned / & their verytees sett at nought
what els can folowe but vyce? which alwayes
requyreth an yll ende. The true loue
of Gods worde / is neuer without his feare.
Neuer can that creature outragyouslye offende / 
which foloweth the true lyne therof.
A 
                     •
                  anterne to oure fete is that worde of the
Lorde / and a lyght vnto oure pathe wayes
in this shadowe of deathe / the eternall father
geue vs his grace to folowe yt.
               2 Fynallye Pantolabus exhorteth all
his readers to praye for the sauegards of our
most worthye prince Edwarde. If this were
out of the Genealogye of stynkynge heresye / 
as yt is also therin / yt were moche more
pleasynge vnto God. He abhorreth all that

is straunge / and not lyke fashyoned to the
exemplar that he hath left in the scripturs.
He turneth awaye his face dysdaynouslye
from all mockynge sacrifyces inuented by
menne and not commaunded of him. As is
the Papistycall Masse with all other blasph

Aaron the hyghe Prest / were consumed in
the Lordes wrathe / for offerynge s
                     •
                  raunge
fyre vncommaunded. Accursed is he which
addeth his owne inuencyon vnto the Lordes
seruyce / or anye thynge els that the scripture
commaundeth not. I counsell therfore
all faythfull beleuers / syncerelye to praye
in sprete and in veryte after Christes holye
doctryne / for their most worthye kynge and
the prince his naturall sonne / that the one
maye succede the other as Salomon ded
Dauid / & as Iosaphat ded Asa / in the faythfull
wayes of the Lorde. And this haue they
good cause to do yf they remembre all thynges.
As their delyueraunce from the greate
Golye of Rome / with sufferaunce to reade
the scripturs which is their syngular sowle
                     •
                  
helthe. What though some of them at tymes
be brent in the fyre for Christes testymonye / 
through the Bisshoppes olde tyrannye.
Nothynge is there lost / but their corruptyble
bodyes. Wheras he suffreth one bodye
in their malyce so to peryshe / he saueth that

                  
                     •
                  owle and a thousande more by the fredome
of Christes Gospell. Blessed be the Lorde
therfore that euer he was borne.
               3 I coūsell no manne to make this prayer
with Pantolabus nor with soche other execrable
Papistes / so damnablye vayne in the
corrupt practyses / stodyes / and deuyses of
their wretched hartes / though yt semeth verye
good and godlye. But praye after y• scripturs
with y• dere heretage of Christ / which
is a churche persecuted as he was / and not
pampred vp here in pryde and in vayne glorye.
It is a congregacion not knowne to the
worlde nor regarded of fleshlye lyuers / nomore
than he was knowne and receyued of
them whan he came into his owne. Praye all
from within / as that churche is from within
lyke as Dauid wytnesseth with all the Apostles
and Prophetes. And lete this be youre
specyall prayer for youre kynge and prince
euermore. Thu eternall God of our fathers
thre distyncte persones in one euerlastynge
Godhede. Thu omnypotent father and creatour
of all. Thu eternall sonne and redemer
Iesus Christ. Thu euerlastynge holy ghost
& conforter equall vnto them both / all one
God in power / substaunce / and nature of the
Godhede / for thy tendre mercyes sake haue
respect vnto oure kynge and yonge prince.
And lyke as thu hast of thy munyfycence
and lyberalyte geuen vnto them the imperyall
crowne and scepture of Englande.

So graunt them to lyue in thy feare / to walke
in thy worde / and to do that is ryghtouse
in thy syght euermore. Graunt them also
Lorde with the swerde that they beare / that
they carrye yt not in vayne / but alwayes to
the ponnyshment of the yll doers / and to the
syngular solace of thy faythfull seruauntes.
For so is thy eternall will. Thus ought true
subiectes to praye without all hypocresye / 
dissymulacyon / and glosynge flatterye.

¶The openinge. 1.
               NOw shuld soche a famouse worke / made
in defence of holye churche / apere notable
vnto the readers therof / except the
name of a notable clarke (as master Pantolabus
is) were putt ther vnto? fytt is yt that
the carpenter shuld stande by his carpētrye / 
and the buylder by his buyldynge. A broken

wall of Babylon hath Pantolabus dawbe
                     •
                  d
vp here of old fauer and loue / but his dyrtye
dawb
                     •
                  rye holdeth not. For lyke an vnworke
manlye dawber he hath done yt with
vntempred claye / contrarye to all godlye admonyshmentes.
Most dampnably hath he
peruerted the sacred scripturs here / to maynteyne
his Popyshe malyce agaynst all Christen
charyte. But Hieremye / Ezechiel / Micheas / 
and Aba
                     •
                  uk / with other holye Prophetes / 
byddeth him and soche other to sett
their hartes at rest. For the cyte which is
buylded with blood / and the howse that standeth
by vnryghtousnesse / shall not alwayes
contynue in the worlde. I shall cast donge in
youre faces 
                     •
                  sayth the Lorde by his Prophete
Malachias) euen the verye donge of youre
solempne feastes and ceremonyes. And yt
shall cleaue fast vpon you and take you with
yt to eternall perdicion. What Ponce Pantolabus
is (which putteth himselfe forth here
for y• Author of this Iest) I nede not to
describe. For the verye worke it selfe setteth
forth his lyuelye ymage. It manyfestlye declareth
him a braynelesse babler / a presumptuouse
ydyote / a frantyck Papist / a peruerter
of the scripturs / a stynkynge heretyque / 
an enemye to God / a secrete louer of Antichrist / 
& a preuye conspyrer agaynst his prince
for the Pope.
               2 Moche accordinge to the ryght nature
therof / is the settinge out here of this heretycall

Genealogie. Abhominably blasphemouse
it is / and therfor it passeth forth vndre
some tytles of abhominacion. It is seyd
first of all to be imprinted at London / which
is a most noble cyte. Verye sorye I am that soche
sylthye frutes shuld come from so worthye
a place. Notwithstandinge I ascribe
not this partycular euyll to that worshypful
cyte / wherin (I knowe) to be people most
vertuouse and godlye. But of this am I certayne.
Though Hierusalem were holye and
the verye cyte of the lorde allowed by the
scripturs / yet was it in conclusion most greuouslye
ponnyshed for sufferinge blasphemers / 
and for vnthankefullye receyuinge of
Christ and his verite. Pater noster was
wont to be a most wholsom prayer / ordayned
and commaunded of Christ to dwell onlye
within mannys sowle / and from thens to be
sent in dayly massage to the eternall father
of heauen. And now he is becomen an out
strete dweller) the name of a lane / or the sygne
of a tauerne. Farre is he changed from
Christes first institucion / a
                     •
                  d from the office
that he appointed him. A farre meane
                     •
                  
change from a pylde popyshe ceremony / wolde
be called a great heresye of y• Bysshoppes.
What this is I leaue it to yowr coniecture.
               3
                     •
                   In this Pater noster rowe / or in bedealleye
whether ye wyll / was this Genealogye
imprinted / at the signe afowr ladye pyte.
What that pyteouse ladye is I can not

tell / but wele I wote she hath no 
                     •
                  ust tyttle
to be called owr ladye. No true fygure is she
to Marye the mother of Christ. For neuer
was she so farre from the ryght faythe / that
she sorowed so largelye for that thīge which
was vnto vs all most necessarye. I knowe
she neuer wept so vndyscretely for the deathe
of Christ / which was owr vniuersall helthe / 
but most hyghly reioysed therin. If she
euer mourned / it was for the synnes of the
people / and for that she sawe his veryte contēpned
of the cruell clergye / as it is yet styll.
They therfor which worshyp that sorowfull
pyte of Marye / do honour that infydelyte wt
she neuer had / and make them therof an Idoll.
Thus is the sygne that Iohan Redmā
dwelleth vndre / an exercrable Idoll / and
he for so magnifyenge her with that tyttle / 
a verye Idoll worshypper. The lesse maruele
is it / that soche fylthye frutes cometh out
of his howse. Here is he not ashamed openlye
to confesse / that he hath sett his handes
to most wycked Papystrye / and vnto an heape
of peruerted Scripturs / to the great dyshonour
both of God and of his kynge. Adioyninge
ther vnto his pryuylege / Ad imprimē
                  dum
solum / the rather to infect his people.
               4 Now foloweth Robert wyer / & he graunteth
also by his owne handye worke / that
he hath promoted forewarde these Popyshe
Poesyes and Scripturs abhominablye peruerted.
Wherin he hath done all that hath

lyen in him / to assure the kīges faythfull subiectes
to geue their good hartes to y• Popes
olde faythe. An vngodlye cruell waye were
it / yf menne ded but mynistre that thinge wt
shuld but poyson the bodyes of the people.
What shall we than recken it / whan that
fylthynesse is ministred of them / which infecteth
their sowles to eternall deathe. Soche
is the vnsacyable thirst of thē that are
couetouse / that they care not what myschefes
they do to get money. If the deuyll had
geuen them a matter ageynst Christ / as his
sworne Chaplayne hath done here ageynst
his true seruauntes / and haue monyed them
wele / they wolde surely haue done by that / 
lyke as they haue done by this. And the
daye wyll ones come that they shall fynde it
all one. The kynges priuylege. Ad imprimē
                  dum
solum / is put to the same / to bringe him
also vndre the selfe same curse / of God / yf
anye chaunce for it at the latter daye (whom
he defende) so good subiectes are thy vnto
him. By soche diuersite of printes is it easy
to perseyue that the sale hath bene great &
the profyghtes therof plentuouse. If the worke
had bene Godly / yt neuer had gone so frelye
abrode / nor with so moche fauer of y• Bysshoppes.
The lorde ones be mercyfull to his
afflicted famelye / and delyuer thē frō their
my
                     •
                  cheues. Amen. ¶The conclusion.
               ¶Expreslye is it here to be seane (dere
frynde in the lorde) what Pantolabꝰ was at
the makinge of this iest / and what manye

other are yet styll in the same synefull lyne
of Antichrist. I perseyue by him and soche other
more / that Leuiathan had than great
strengthe in his loynes / to sende forth soche
sturdye babes. Not longe afore that they
hydde their heades / and durst not be seane
abrode. But thā ded they on their mothers
shamelesse face / and were ageyne as bragginge
as in their Popes tyme. Small harme
is it to them that the Beastes head was wounded / 
it is so wele and workemanlye healled
vp ageyne. Not to Christes glorye haue
they fashyoned thē a newe churche now after
the Gospell preachinge / but after their
owne vayne glorye ageyne yet for aduauntage.
Destroyed yet vtterly shall that execrable
mōstre be within short space (trust vpon
it) by y• only breathe of y• lordes eternall mouthe
For now doth he call to remembraunce
the blood of his elect Seruauntes whō she
hath slayne & seduced to establyshe her kyngedō
of lyes & abhominaciōs. Now shal she
be subdued of that heauenlye verite / whō
she hath of so longe tyme suppressed / the beast
peryshinge wt her whō she hath worshypped
in so manye kyndes of Idolatrye. That
lorde make spede to fulfyll his euerlastinge
