And the like alſo her Maieſtie commandeth to all Strangers borne to be obſerued on their part: And for the ſatiſfaction of all ſorts, both Engliſh and Strangers, her Maieſtie moſt ſtraightly commandeth her Maior of London, and all other Iuſticers, as they will anſwere at their perils duely to ſee with indifferencie, and without any partiality, the firſt occaſioners next hereafter of quarrels and frayes, to be ſeuerely puniſhed to the example of others, like as it is preſently ordered by her Maieſtie, that the whole circumſtance of certaine frayes in London, betwixt her Subiects and certaine Strangers ſhalbe duely examined and tryed, and according to the Lawes of the Realme, iudged and determined. For this is her Highnes determination, that no partiall fauor be ſhewed to Engliſh or Stranger, but that euery of them ſhall liue in the ſafetie and protection of her Lawes.
