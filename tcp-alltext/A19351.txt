            TO THE RIGHT
HONOVRABLE SIR
Iohn Popham Knight, Lord
chiefe Iustice of England,

Counsell.
            
               HOnorable Sir, since
I can truely, let me
confidently affirme,
this boldnesse proceedes
onely from
the sight of your vertues; I honour
you, and reuerence the executions
of your place; I behold not your fortune,
but your selfe: and since it is so,
be content to accept these and mee,
both which offer themselues to you,
not for any thing they can, but willingly
would do you seruice.
            
               From the honourer of your
vertues, W. Cornwalleys.

            DISCOVRSES VPon
Seneca the Tragedian.
            
               
                  —Odia qui nimium timet,
                  Regnare nescit: Regna custodit metus.
               
            
            
               THough common
Experience doth
manifest, and naturall
reason iustifie,
that States in an
equalitie of degree,
vpheld by persons knowing no
preeminence, cannot stand, nor
promise continuance: yet cannot
the aspiring constitution of man,
with patience behold higher erected
fortunes, how iustly soeuer
obtayned: so if hee cannot reach

them with equalitie, hee will with
enuie, whose effectes would be
dangerous, did not feare bridle
them. Then must Soueraigntie
nourish feare in subiection; for
out of subiectes feare groweth
Princes safetie.
            But how this awe is to be obtayned,
restes the Arte; for
feare hath two additions, that
make it good or bad; from some
feare comes hatred, from such
feare ruine: from feare loue; from
this preseruation, soueraigntie;
with this is Gouernement, with
the other Tyrannie. The power
of a Prince breeds feare; his actions
hatred or loue: from his actions
then must hee draw his flourishing,
which illustrates the noblenesse
of the minde; for the commands
ouer fortune, whose power
stretcheth no further, then to
lay open vertue; meane states

beeing therefore miserable, because
wanting stuffe to shew their
workemanship; for liberalitie
consisting onely in meditation, is
inuisible: Temperance with pouertie
hath not much to doe, and
so of the rest.
            
               —Odia qui nimium timet,
               Regnare nescit.—
            
            There is no affection so vnnaturall
to Princes, as feare; the limits
of their proceedings, must be
bounded by other respects: For
rightly hath this Authour determined;
Who feares hatred too
much, knowes not how to raigne.
It is impossible for one person to
harbour Maiestie and feare; for
they are opposite, differing as
much, as to command and obay.
Feare begettes obedience,

Maiestie doth what hee doth vncompelled:
for compulsion and
inforcement killes authoritie:
but that hee is vnrestrained by
feare, giues him not a lawlesse libertie;
though he wants inforcement,
hee doth not perswasion;
which in all noble natures, preuailes
more then compulsion: hee
is not vrged by feare, but in feares
stead hath iustice, hath the sight of
his owne place, hath the knowledge,
that vpon his shoulders
rests the whole body of the foundation;
which respectes curbe
Princes, vnrestrayned by feare.
More particularly to the Tragedians
meaning,—Odia qui nimium
timet; It belongs to a Prince
to shunne the deseruing hate; not
to feare hatred: feare, as it is said,
belongs not to them; and if in
them, bastardizeth their natures,
and corrupts them. The vniust

partialitie of some natures, abused
by selfe loue, wil hate the execution
of iustice, and not vnderstanding
the intent of lawes, thinke iniuriously
of their executors. This
must not be regarded by Princes,
nor stop their wel intended courses.
The satisfaction of his conscience
is Metridate expelling the
poyson of ill tongues, and himselfe
finding he hath performed his office
with iudgemēt, shal be strong
inough to resist vulgar thoughts,
which liue in opinion. The hate
of these is feeble, and howsoeuer
common it is to the worst meanings,
to giue them handsome colours,
yet cannot these present
their griefes to iudiciall men, so
shadowed, as not to bee discerned
faulty: so cannot the way of trueth
beget hate, able to doe harme; malice
and spleene from some particular
it may, but they are too weak

euer to doe hurt. But were there
perill in the performance of the
true office of a Prince, yet must it
not disswade him; for shuns he the
execution of his duety for feare of
hate, he explaneth his regalitie to
bee an office vndertaken, to please
himself, not to profit his countrey,
then which mind▪ there is not any
more monsterous and detestable.
The iudgemēt of al causes, the deciding
all controuersies, the cēsure
of all mē, the sentēce determining
all actions, are his, & in these performances
restes the very soule of
the state, & the life of a states flourishing,
in which shal feare of hate
make him swarue, he ruinates and
depopulates his kingdom: for this
pusillanimity wil bring confusion,
whē the vertuous and vitious, well
deseruers, and yll, the accuser and
the accused, shall goe indifferently
reckoned of.
            
               
—Regna custodit metus.—
            It is the destinated affection to
seruile natures, feare: and it is wel,
for they are not so straightly boūd
to be good, as are higher fortunes.
Two are the bandes, whereby the
diuine wisedome preserueth the
world: Loue of vertue, and feare
of punishment: and thus are some
(I am afraid most) kept from the
extremitie of ill; Therefore in the
preseruation of Kingdomes, feare
hath, and ought to haue a great
hand. It is not the often vsing
tortures, and executions, that purchaseth
this; though offendours
suffering, and according to the
fact rigorous execution, is wholesome
to the bodie of a state: and
that I verily beleeue, the hanging
of one man, to worke better effects
amongst men, then twentie
made into mummie; yet that feare

amongst Subiects, that preserueth
the kingdome, hath his originall,
not from this, but from the princes
life: for those states onely are inriched
with the blessednes of vertue,
and tranquilitie, where the
Prince vseth his authoritie to chastise
offences, not to authorize his
owne offences; for though hee
hath the oddes of being aboue the
law, yet if he giue his Subiects euill
example, they wil follow him;
albeit he seeke to quench the fire
of their viciousnesse, with neuer so
much of their blood. It was a common
tricke among the heathen
Princes, to fetch their petygree
from the Gods; I doe not thinke
their fortunes had so besotted
thē, as to think so themselues, but
only nourisht the opinion to draw
the more awe & obedience from
their Subiects. They should haue
imitated the diuine powers in the

puritie of their liues, and so haue
beene neerer the gods, and more
feared of men: for nothing produceth
true feare from Subiects to
their Prince, but the worthinesse
of his owne person. His power, his
splendor, his fortune, his gards, and
other circumstances, (without
vertue) doe rather stirre vp disdaine
against him and his fortune,
then awfull regard: the vse of all
these things wil be conuerted into
detestable names; his power, tyrannie,
his splendor, prodigalitie,
his fortune cursed, his gard termed
the instruments of oppressiō,
his other signols of authoritie, the
deckings of a corrupt minde: vnder
which name, when the people
shall behold them, they bring his
authoritie to contempt; and being
once brought to that declyning,
they neuer leaue roulling, vntill
they come to the bottome of vnhappinesse.

               Regna custodit metus.—
But that feare must come from the
vertue of the Prince, not from his
power, or els it holds not: for without
vertue, it hath no vertue.
            
               Vpon these verses.
               O Regnorum magnis, fallax
fortuna bonis, in praecipiti
dubioque nimis excelsa locas.
               WHo beholds or vndertakes
a Dyademe, meerely respecting
the magnificence of the
place, chuseth so vndiscreetly, as
leauing the contentment of the
minde, for colours to paint the body.
All the States, and Estates of
the world, being founded and originally
discended from man, must
necessarily accompany his transitorinesse,
the which though wee
know, & see dayly chances of mutabilitie
acted before vs, yet when
any thing is imbraced by vs, rather

for our owne vse, then the
right vse; neither can reason, experience,
nor the euery daies hapning
of such things, perswade vs
to part with it as we ought. Thus
of that highest degree amongst
men, were it mannaged by a hand
iustly administring to all, and as he
is a head, so content to take the
least pleasure, and yet to take care
for all, neither would they complaine
of fortune, nor hold this
great good deceiueable. It is the
erronious opinion of the world,
that deceiues the world: it is not
pleasure to doe what wee list, but
neuer to stray frō what we should;
for I thinke all good tastes will
iudge it more sweet, to do well, thē
to be able to do ill without cōtrolment.
This done, principalitie excelleth
all states in happines; for it
resembleth the diuine state, whose
communicating power of doing

good to all, is numbred amongst
his blessed perfectiōs: this is in the
office of a Prince, which makes it
without exception the most excellent
estate amongst men, nor is
it subiect to fortune; for nothing
can perish, that hath trueth and
iustice for the foundation.
               Dubioque nimis excelsalocas.
               That it is situated by, and subiect
to the most headlong downe-fal,
me thinkes tels them the nature of
their place, which is aduice, keeping
them from danger: it is meete
they should stand thus ticklely, for
the mind of mā is not to be trusted
with a life of that power and preeminence,
seperated from care and
doubt: for were hee, his once falling
would make him fall once
more. Doubt belongs to Princes,
but not by the name of doubt, but
prouidence; this iogs him, if vaine
pleasures lul him in sensuality; this

whispers in his eares, Beware, and
sharpeneth his sight to looke into
the courses of his own life, & to amend
his errors; this gardeth him
frō outward and inward inuasions:
both which strengthning & quickning
his vnderstanding, to penetrate
into the most secret drifts of
his aduersaries, to cōclude this prouidence
or doubt, is the mother of
counsel, industry, and doing well▪
—Dubioque nimis. But too much
doubt argueth too much guiltines,
which this too much suspitiō confesseth:
vice vncōmitted may make
vs beleeue she is pleasāt, but once
tasted, so powerfull a vertue is iustice,
as, though she doth not publikely
chastice offences, yet neuer
doth shee omit, inwardly to proue
they are offenders, & after proofe
not to punish: so much of Iustice
hath euery particular body in it
selfe: who therefore will not doubt

too much, must not doe ill too
much; for they are inseparable.
            
            
               Vpon this verse.
               Miserrimum est timere, cum speres
nihil.
               IT is an obseruation worthy of
regard, to contemplate how the
bodie of man is equally poysed
with affections; he hath hope and
feare, loue and hate, and so the
rest, euery contrary hath his contrary,
but in such an equallitie, as
hee goeth right vp in these extremities;
and the minde doth well
amongst these, as the bodies constitution
consisting of dissenting
elements, so long hath health, as
these parts of his are without an
extraordinary preeminence: but
when any affection in the minde,
or any humour in the body, vsurps
an ouer-swaying authoritie,
the body languisheth, and the
mind thinks it selfe miserable; for


                     
                     
                        •
                     iserrimū est timere: cū speres nihil.
               
               Miserrimum est timere▪—
               I haue often spoken of this
feare, and yet necessarily must
here speake of it againe. There is
no affection, that afflicteth the
minde vpon the first apprehension,
but feare. Yet so strangely powerfull
are all affections, as they
make the possessed body delight
in his torment, & prosecute those
infected thoughts, though with
the losse of his whole contentment
and quiet; yet is it most miserable
to feare: for that is
miserablest, that is most remote
frō contentment. Infinite are the
occasions of vexation that encoū
                  ter
vs without seeking them, but
feare addes both the number and
force of griefes, and beleeues thē
both more and more terrible then
they are: therefore did the Tragedian
end with miserrimum est

timere, he should end with trueth;
for I hold feare the most afflicting
punishment, that accompanied
the fall of man.—Cum speres
nihil.—
               
               Whether it be, that this life,
being but a counterfeit of life, displeaseth
the soule, (to mitigate
which anguish, shee administreth
hope to her selfe for a cordiall,) or
whether the possession of things
comes short of the intended satisfaction;
certaine it is, that the most
pleasing and most conuersant
thoughtes of the best contented
mindes, are descended from hope,
which hope doubtlesse is the vnspotted
issue of the soule, being
little a kinne to the bodie, though
behoofefull to the bodie; for the
acts of the body are more grosse
and beauy, which euery man may
easily discerne, if he obserues his
intendmēts, before executiō. For

whiles onely in the braine they
carie a much more delightfull representation,
then after, when
they come vnder the censure of
the eye, our life is nothing but a
life of hope, which, if we cannot
haue with a possibilitie▪ wee will
without; for we cannot liue without
it, what shift soeuer we make.
The most plenteous possessed
creature of contentment that euer
was, annexeth hope to his ample
fruition, and is content with that
he hath, because he hath hope. It
neuer leaues vs, no, not when we
lie a dying: men vnassisted by
Christianitie, at this time, euen by
nature are taught, to hope of another
life, from which, neyther ignorance
nor impiousnes can driue
them: but when they cannot build
hope vpon their own deserts and
knowledges, they will ground it
vpon mercie and hope, and so die

imbracing it, and neuer leaue hoping,
till they haue left breathing.
               Miserimum est timere, cum
speres nihil.
               It is most miserable to feare
when wee cannot hope, it is, for
feare vnballansed by hope, is desperation,
then which both by diuine
and humane vnderstādings,
there cannot be a greater curse: into
such extremities runne the affections
of man, when not curbed
by reason, or counterpoysed by
a contrary affection: for the bodie
and minde agree in receiuing safetie
from a mediocritie, which is
easily discerned, since no part of
man holdes out in extremes, but
thereby is driuen into the greatest
daungers, being violently carried
into diseases and death.
            
            
               
               Vpon these verses.
               —Prosperum, ac foelix scelus
virtus vocatur; sontibus parēt boni.
               HOw much outward prosperity
preuailes ouer iudgement,
how willingly we suffer the glitering
of fortune to dazell our vnderstandings,
how we coozen our
selues of the discerning truth, with
looking vpon euery thing through
the false glasses of wealth or want,
by him that is yet sober, and not
drunke with these partiall affections,
cannot chuse but mooue him
to much commiseration, & to pity,
and shun the society of the world.
Taking the last of things, and being
led by euents, wee know nothing
originally, nor doe wee in
our liues any thing, but lift vp
them, already vp; and throwe
lower the already ouerthrowen.

How often haue I heard the weakest
bent bowes of reason, shoote
at the highest actions? No, this is
nothing so common, as the vulgar
censure vpon the matters of most
importance, in which they will as
boldely vndertake to commend
and disprayse, as if they had bene
conuersant in the seriousest counsels:
but thus goeth their attributing
prayse or disprayse; hee hath
prayse that winnes; who loseth,
loseth not onely his designes, but
withal loseth the opiniō of hauing
eyther wisedome or vertue. To
whō should I lay this fault, but to
our own follies, who lay the chiefe
estimation, not vpon vertue, but
fortune, and perhaps, our follie is
permitted by the diuine hand, to
abate the pride of higher persons,
that cannot with al their greatnes,
defend themselues frō the blowes
of ignorance and indiscretion. So

are the sinnes both of high and
low punished; the low, inamored
of wealth, are depriued of wisedom;
the high, subiect to these vniudiciall
censures, haue their high
attempts soyled and made contemptible,
with beeing pulled
thorow these common gutters of
myre and pollution.
               
                  —Prosperum, ac foelix scelus,
                  virtus vocatur.—
               
               Prosperous and happy wickednes
is called vertue: wickednes can
neyther be prosperous nor happy.
Prosperity is a word destinated to
the world, and by that word wee
vnderstand wealth, honour, estimation
and such; but all these being
but the adherents of a transitorie
life, and that life depending
vpon another of much more excellēcie:
who obtaines this prosperitie
with wickednes, loseth that;
who loseth the best for the worst,

prospereth not; who prospers not,
is not in prosperitie: neither can I
call it prosperitie, to be accounted
so by the world; and in the meane
time to haue that most vnquiet
companion, an exclaiming conscience,
which as certainely followes
dishonest attempts obteined, as
desire prouokes before obteining:
betweene which two, the vnsatiable
mind is perpetually tormēted.
               —Foelix scelus.
               The contrariety of these two
words, illustrates how much our
seruile natures are content to debase
themselues, to lose trueth, the
highest part of reason, I, sence the
lowest part of man, happy wickednes,
an epithite due, not to the best
of our actions, yet are we cōtent to
bestow it on the worst of our actions
of wickednes. Can any thing
subiect to the frailetie of time bee
happy? no, not possible: happines

is not of this world: we may be in
the way of happinesse, when by a
good life wee are in the way to
heauen, but cannot here bee happy;
for nothing that is transitorie
is happy, happinesse being due to
expresse onely the ioyes of eternitie;
for no pleasures can reach happinesse,
that stoope so low as time.
Then can it not bee due to wickednesse,
whose groueling earthly
minde neuer lookes so high, but
stickes fast in the imagination of
the vile pleasures of the world, and
hath his best contentments of no
more continuance, then the sences
pleasure, which tast and swallow,
in an instant.
               Virtus vocatur.—
               It seemes vertue once had the
Empire of the world, for antiquitie
shewes many coynes of her
stampe, and euen this age so feares
her power, as euery one will weare

her liuery, though fewe do her seruice.
The worst, though they loue
vice, yet adorne their ill with the
counterfeit colour of vertue: so
strong is shee yet, and so feeble is
vice: seemings are now sought, beings
thought superfluous; the labour
of most men now adayes is
not to obtaine trueths, but opinions
warrant: so are most of the
actions of these last ages; but painted
with coūterfeit colours, which
last no longer then themselues
liue, so long perhappes feare or
flattery makes them hold; but they
taken away by time, they are either
deuoured by obliuion, or
discouered to be without al worth,
or trueth. Yet can I not but commend
their policies, that intitle
vertue to their particular actions;
for nothing els goeth with so
generall an applause: fayles hee
here, he shal be supplyed by them,

that no other respect hath layd
hold of; wants he that? hee hath
yet pitie, well wishers, and good
opinion: so hath it beene already
obserued by the world, since no
great action hath passed without
the name of suppressing Tyrannie;
chastising the irreligious, or
the common good. This is policie;
but that I speake of now, basenesse:
so miserable are the minds
as well as fortunes of the vulgar,
that no action of greatnes passeth
without commendation: doth he
meane to catch the people in his
cappe, and makes courtesie intrap
their simple vnderstandings, they
auow him to be humilitie it selfe.
Doth pride and a selfe-opinion
make him looke bigge? he carrieth
himselfe like a Prince, to
whose place it belongeth not to
lose of his height, by declining to
familiaritie: doth he spend? hee

reckons not his owne estate, so he
may supplie the wants of others:
doth he saue? 'tis nobly done, not
to vndoe his posteritie: Loues he
warres? magnanimitie and fortitude
shines in him; is it peace? no
common-wealths men are so
worthie as the preseruers of
peace: In a word, doth hee what
hee will, hee doth vertuously; let
him get prosperitie, and get it
how he can, he shall not want vertue,
for—prosperū ac foelix scelus
Virtus vocatur.—
               
               —Sontibus parent boni.
               There is not a greater plague
to bee inflicted vpon mortalitie,
then this; for the subiects of wicked
gouernours cannot prosper:
inferiours participate with the natures
of their betters, as birds with
the weather, they moue as they
moue: Imitation being the destinie

of those, that are not by the
Destinies allowed their owne
choise; who subscribes not to
their licentiousnesse, with putting
on the fashion of their life, perisheth
by the hand of tyrannie;
who doth, by the hand of the diuine
Iustice: So is there no safetie
vnder such Magistrates, since
refusing or obeying, ruines one of
the two best parts of man. The
good obey the ill; it is worth the
obseruation, how the eternall wisdome
applies and suffers: ill is
here made the touch-stone of
good, and good obeyes ill, to trie
goodnesse constancie: could the
ill soften or giue the least alteration
to the good, it were not good,
nor were good then worthy of
the preeminence. Thus doth he
make goodnesse combate with his
contrarie, which contention
ends with the excellencie of his

iustice and wisedome; his wisedome,
in descrying by this means
hypocrisie; his iustice, that at the
end of these warres, both parties
are made ready for his sentence,
when no excuse or colour can mitigate
or darken his reward to the
victor, and punishment to the
vanquished. In the time of life, against
this oppression there is
hardly any counsell to be giuen,
since if he commeth to authoritie
by succession or iust election, it is
not lawful to practise against him;
but if otherwise, it is otherwise:
and a life is well sold, that loseth it
in conspiring their ouerthrow: but
atteyning it by any of the two other
meanes, howsoeuer it proue▪
hee must be suffered: for so God
hath appointed of the Anoynted;
and perhaps he vseth them,
for a scourge to the wicked, which
happens often, & then it is meet:

                  
                     •
                  or it seemes his pleasure is, that
—sontibus parent boni.
               
            
            
               Vpon these Verses.
               
                  —Noscere hoc primum decet:
                  Quid facere Victor debeat, victus
pati.
                  Violenta 
                        •
                     emo Imperia continuit diu,
                  Moderata durant.—
               
               VNto euery life, vnto euery fortune,
a peculiar fashion belongeth,
which whether it comes
from the all one working of fortune
with all, and so the continuance
and generalitie hath made it
customes, or whether the alteration
brings with it an alteration
of behauiour, carying in it selfe
the aspect fitting it selfe; certaine
it is, the world hath been long gouerned
with certaine set formes,
which haue gone from the father
to the sonne; as the vanquished to

lose their mindes with their fortunes,
the Victors to proclaime,
Quodcun
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      libuit, facere victor licet.
               
               But how doth wisdomes moderation
repine at this downe-hill
headlong course? to what end exclaimes
shee? Hath nature giuen
man reason, time experience,
since hee entertaines the changes
of the world, so ignorantly, as if
they were strangers to him? he fals
not too low, nor mounts not too
dangerously hie, whose reason &
experience married together,
hath betweene thē brought forth
their destinated issue, Moderation.
This is the stay of the reeling
steps of humanitie; this the
vanquisher of fortune, & the true
counseller in the managing all estates.—Noscere
hoc primum decet.
               
               If manuall trades aske time and
experience, to be expert in their
faculties, needs must those minds
that professe the seruing of their

countries with their minds, haue
a time of prenticehood and learning:
for the minds executions are
more difficult and of more importance:
if a trade-mans worke pleaseth
not the chapman, haply it
may be mended, or at the worst,
there is but so much lost: the effects
of the mind can hardly be recalled,
& if miscarried, dangerous.
Euery man by the state he is born
in, may gesse in what maner he is
to doe his Countrey seruice: so
ought he to prepare himself, especially
those nobly descended,
which as they haue a greater portion
of their Countrey then ordinary
men, so are they bound extraordinarily
to care for her preseruation;
they are chiefe Actors
vpon this stage, whose action if it
doth not fit their part, whose part
if forgotten or not learned, the
whole matter is disgraced, and
themselues more taxed then a

Messenger or a mule, vpon whom
the eies of men haue set no note.
It is then the office of a true discerner
into things, not to vndertake
any place or office, in the
managing which, hee is yet ignorant,
but to prepare himselfe
for that is likely to follow; for the
first lesson of wisdome is,
               
                  —Noscere hoc primum decet,
                  Quid facere victor debeat, victus pati.
               
               In generall, mercie belongeth
to the Conquerour; for if the fault
be but slight, the conquered hath
punishment ynough, to hold his
life, of any lord but God: besides,
his owne destinie is vnknowne,
which may come to the same
point and then his clemencie may
procure him clemencie: more it
often hapneth, commiseration of
the estate of enemies hath conuerted
them, and made them perfect

friends: here then to be rigorous,
were his owne losse; for
there is no possession comparable
to that of friendes. But particularly,
the cause of quarrell, the
nature of the people, their force,
their distance must produce the
Victors vse of his Conquest. If
they take vp armes being Subiects,
and now become rebels, example
must teach them to know
their errours; if a neighbour or
confederate, that hath committed
trecherous actions, or proceeded
contrary to the law of nations; rigour
againe. If naturally the
people be contentious, it is necessary
to suppresse their natures,
with cutting off their strength;
if their forces bee apt to intice
them to armes, to abate their
force, the cause of their inticement;
if farre off, and yet meete
to bee held in subiection, to remoue

the naturals likely to practise,
and to plant Gouernours of
the Victors appointment, and to
mingle the blood of the Conquerours
with the conquered. In this
first, the punishment must not exceed
the offence, for then it is crueltie:
for the other, they must
be accomplished without much
blood, for the shedding of blood
without a very iust cause, is inhumane.
To threaten people must
be carefully shunned, for he that
giueth his enemie desperation,
giueth him a weapon more dangerous
then valure. From both
rigour and mercie, proceede great
benefits to a State, but they must
bee vsed according to a Princes
owne state; for if hee bee yet to
conquer them, his estimation of
clemencie softeneth their spirits,
and is the onely meanes to make
them cowards: if already in subiection,

their opinion of their
Princes rigour keepeth them in
awe.
               But Iustice must reconcile
this question, of which, is most
necessary; for by his warrant, to
saue or kill is lawfull.
               —Victus pati.
               Aduersitie hath no more to do
but this, a short lesson though
hard, hard through the custome
of sympathizing with our fortunes,
a misfortune farre more
lamentable then the first; for bewayling
them, drawes the minde
to an extreme basenesse, to an extreme
follie: for if our harmes be
not past recouerie, yet was there
neuer any helped by this direction,
many haue beene despised by
this; for from others there is
no assistance drawne, except

in the way of charitie, which euery
worthy nature abhorreth; but
from the strength of our owne either
inward or outward graces:
the outward is already lost, the inward
lost, if wee bewaile the outwards
losse, which in the Victor
stirreth vp eyther contempt or
pitie, the best of which in a noble
minde is more abhorred, then
the worst part of fortune. In the
vanquished, debarred from all assistance
of outward thinges, is
there an oportunitie to shew their
owne worth, more then in any other
time; for he is then separated
from those things, that are wont
to make disfigured monsters to
looke handsomely: though there
bee a triall in the moderation of
high fortunes, yet is it a thing
much more easie, it commeth not
so neere the quicke: for hee that
endureth famishing without alteration,

hath a greater part of vertue,
then he that commeth from a
feast without a surfet, patience
beeing a more substantiall part of
Vertue, then temperance: this is
left him, which should procure
both patience and comfort, the
exercise of the minde being to be
preferred much aboue the ease of
the body. This meditation, with
a minde iudicially determining
what ought to bee done, not what
is most ordinarily done, cannot
choose but learne him in calamitie,
to weare that part with as
much ease as he did the other: the
strength of the minde is able to
doe more then this, whose power,
whose worth, whose abilities, wee
are ignorant and so destitute of,
with following the beaten way of
the idle vulgar.
               
                  
                  Violenta nemo Imperia continuit diu,
                  Moderata durant.—
               
               No extreme continueth; an ordinance
of natures, to suppresse
conspiracies, for might the force
of violence continue, her faire
worke would soone be confounded:
shee hath giuen limits to all
things, and to all things courses
fitting their natures, which gone
beyond, and able to runne on,
would beget a new Chaos, turning
all things from their owne
natures; there would be nothing,
for cōbating against one another,
& setting their forces one against
another; the Victor would conuert
all things to his owne nature,
and that would destroy nature,
whose glory is the multiplicitie of
her instruments, and the working
thē with one another. Much more

dangerous is it in men, whose reason
is able to resist violence, and
more strongly, whose reason teacheth
them to abhorre violence.
The state of a Prince is vpheld by
his subiects opinion, his Maiestie
begetteth reuerence, so long as
his power fitteth it selfe to iustice;
his Royaltie maintained, so long
as they find his wisdome and vertue
gouerns him, and hee them in
peace: nothing assisteth another,
that is not againe by that assisted.
The violence amongst men is tyrannie,
an humour begotten betweene
selfe-loue & ignorance;
it resembleth selfe-loue, in prizing
his owne safetie aboue the
liues or loues of his subiects; like
ignorance, in fetching the means
of his safetie from false grounds,
an humor of all humours the most
vnsafe and most displeasing: for
he is not safe, when he is safe, his

minde thinketh then of danger
and treason, and for the bodies
safetie without the minds, it little
helpeth, for the minde giueth
quiet to the bodie, not the bodie
to the minde; most displeasing it
is, for it displeaseth the whole
world, and with the world himselfe,
for hee raiseth no contentment
out of his course, and that
displeaseth, that goeth without
contentment.
               No State of this nature continueth:
if the Turkish Gouernement
bee enforced against
this Axiome, it may be answered,
It is a tyranny, that goeth masked
vnder religion: for were it so naked,
as the people might behold
they suffer by the bloody hand of
crueltie, without the allowance of
God, and that his actions were altogether
vnlawfull, soone would
that State bee brought within

the compasse of this Axiome, No
violence continueth.
               —Moderata durant.
               The whole world is vpheld by
moderation, frō the highest to the
lowest, especially man is beholding
to her; for without her helpe, of
all other, hee is the most detestable
creature: without moderation, affection
conquers reason; without
moderation, the wit of man will
serue a wrong master; without
moderation, the body will rebell
against the soule; without moderation,
the soule yeelds to the body;
in a word vnmoderated, both
soule and body perisheth. This is
she, that makes the distinction betwixt
vertue and vice; this is shee,
that makes courage valour, that
without moderation would be angry,
and then furie; this is she, that
separateth iustice, and crueltie;
prouidence, from feare; power,

from tyranny; maiesty, from pride:
this is she that keepeth temperāce
from staruing her self, thrift from
couetousnes, humilitie from basenes;
this is she that tempereth, and
keepeth in frame the whole frame
of the world, without whō violence
& extremes her contraries, would
ouerthrow & ruine all. Thus much
owe we to moderation, to whom
after our seruice to God, if wee
would sacrifice a serious meditatiō
to her excellency, our actiōs would
thriue the better: for no mā is wise,
nor vertuous, nor any thing
worth, without moderatiō; thus age
hath preeminence ouer youth: for
their affections by time growen
weak, & by time their experience
being growen strong, they haue a
more ample portiō of moderation
thē youth, whose affectiōs strong,
& experiēce weake, moderation is
resisted, & so folly gouernes him.
               
                  
Non est ad astra mollis e terris
via.
               SO subiect is the constitution of
man to follow the peruerse coū
                  sel
of his body, as the obiect of his
soule: vertue is called hard, the
bodyes corrupt satisfaction, pleasure;
weighed down with the grosnes
of which, his ascension to the
starres, to worthines, to heauen, is
difficultie: so ouer balanced are
the excellēt designes of the soule,
with the bodie and his affections;
but accounting of this difficultie,
as it rightly ought, and as wee are
content in other things, which
haue esteeme for their rarenesse,
scarsity, & hard obtaining, & more
for this, thē for themselues bearing
price, it should not make the Port
of vertue vnfreqented, it should

not wither our endeuours, but rather
hearten our soyles and make
vs shoote vp, with the meditation
of this incomparable blessing, and
bee spurres to hasten vs on to this
excellēt cariere. Vertue is she that
maketh vs apt for this 
                     •
                  light, vice is
the burthen of impediment; vertue
is, and is the way to heauen;
vice, the earth and a heauinesse,
sinking & still falling downeward:
from vertue we receiue two wings
to moūt with, pleasures, resistance;
vertue applyed from vice, two
clogges, sloth, and appetite; heere
rests the happines and vnhappines
of man, here rests the difficulty of
our exaltation, for
non est ad astra mollis e terris via.
               
               This body of vertue, which is
the haruest of a well-ended life, is
no otherwise obtained, but by obeying
the soules counsell, whose
diuine essence beholdeth no other

thing with contentment, but vertue:
for neuer was there soule so
corrupted by cōmunicating with
the body, as not to offer men good
instructions, the fault hath bene in
the bodies disobedience: for otherwise
vertue would bee as fast fixed
to man, as life. The strength of the
best and largest vnderstanding, is
too weake and too short to incompasse
the full & exact lineaments
of vertue: we know her, rather by
her contrary, then by her selfe: we
neuer saw the picture of fortitude
to the life; wee neuer sawe temperance
well placed, but cowardize
and excesse haue made imaginatiō
gesse at vertue, with thinking
her altogether vnlike vice. Well
may I then not doubt of pardon,
if I misse in the desciphering this
sanctified peece, who am a man,
and yong; by both states full ynough
of errors and misprision, especially,

the last, the strength of
whose affectiōs, if they cary him violently
out of ye way, is by custome
made venial. Thē am I not cōpelled
to worke aboue my strength,
who already haue confessed my
weakenes: my pouerty can not tell
you of acts, but of thoughts; these
papers are no cronicles that proue
certainety, but like Kalenders that
go by gesse: I haue thought of vertue,
& this verse hath reuiued that
meditation, of which in generall I
will say something. This only substantiall
peece of all things possible
to be comprehended & possessed
by man, was once goodnes,
whē goodnes was vnlaboured excellencie;
but when the heauenly
fire infused, was quēched by earthly
concupiscence, it became then
laborious and painefull; with the
change of our state the ancre-hold
of man was trāslated out of goodnes
into vertue, a word expressing

a possibility rather thē a possession
of grace. Vertue is not thē
like the fortune of elder brothers,
whose patrimony falleth to thē by
successiō without further care, but
like yonger brothers states, ye must
fetch their aduancements out of
their own industries: to go iust with
the bodies pleasure, to obserue
his satisfaction aboue any thing,
is not the way; this is euery day
to fall: but he that aspireth to this
flight to the starres, must make his
body hūbly desire his soule to purifie
and make apt his grosse inclosure
of earth. Nō est ad astra mollis
e terris via. In times past, whē the
goodnes of vertue was not fully
discouered, but their electiōs drew
their force rather frō a gallāt industrious
inclinatiō, then frō gratefulnes
of honoring ye worlds Creator,
or ye hope of eternity; yet euē then
they magnified nor deified none,
but mē famous for atchiuemēts, or

profitable inuentions. Thus came
the multiplicitie of the heathen
gods, most of whom were so excellent,
either in chiualrie, or in managing
the state of peace, as draue
their countrey men betweene the
effects of admiration, and gratefulnesse
to proclaime them gods.
Thus Iupiter, who doubtles was
an excellēt souldier; thus Bacchus,
for finding out the vse of the wine;
whose meanes though wee haue
spotted with many imputations,
no doubt they were extraordinary
men of qualitie, whom the people
of those times made gods, though
the Poets of after ages made one
a lecher, the other a drunkard: but
that was not their fault, but a fault
of the idlenes of poeticall fancies.
From these may be seene, that moral
vertues are not to be obteined,
without the imployment of the
minde and body, laysinesse the

yonger brother of idlenesse, is
one of the burthens of impediment,
the soule is of too fine and
quicke a mettal, to loue doing nothing;
shee must haue employment,
otherwise she wil grow dull
and heauie, and like prisoners that
are debarred exercise, fatte and
vnweildsome: in many things
doth the soule follow the bodies
inclination, euen as the eye seeth
by the assistance of a spectacle,
whose glasse, if false, the eye cannot
see truely; if thicke, my stily:
the body by cherishing groweth
not able, but like a pampered
horse, short winded, pursie, and
vnseruiceable, whose organes by
this meanes growe vnapt to performe
their functions, and the
soule depriued of shewing her
dexteritie, like a house vnhabited,
groweth desolate and ruinous.
               
                  
Contrarily, the soule cherished
and obserued, recompenseth her
obseruer, with a more large increase,
then haruest doth the husbandman.
               So for the first iourney to vertue,
there cannot bee a truer
way appointed, then the subiecting
the bodie, and giuing the
soules motions libertie: for the
soule by cherishing flourisheth;
the bodie cherished, decayeth.
               Nowe of the wings enabling
our flight, the first is pleasures resistance,
not the true pleasure,
but a wrong conceiued: for the
hope of the true, is the life of all
good actions, and all men liue
by the meditation of the obtayning
this summe of happinesse.
               But wee miscall and mistake

vertue, reading whose front, and
conceiuing there is nothing in
her, but a stearne depriuation of
libertie, so leaue her.
               But howe doeth our imagination
erre, since vertue vndertaketh
to leade men into
the mansion of a neuer dying
pleasure?
               And the mayne difference
of vertue and vice, that maketh
the one worthie of embracement,
the other of refusall,
is vertues continuance in
pleasure; vices sodaine conuersion
into dolour and calamitie.
               I cannot denie, but the false
solicitours for vice our senses,
bring a kinde of pleasure with
their satisfaction; but so short it is,
as euerie man knoweth 
                     •
                  ow
subiect to ende this surfeiting

pleasure with griefes and vexations.
It is the permanencie of
pleasure then, that makes it worthie,
which though it commeth
vnto vs not by any immediate
meanes, wee must not therefore
refuse, for so commeth all things
to man, which is the cause that
the life of man must be laborious
and painefull: for so are all things,
that must vse second and third
meanes, for obtaining the first
and chiefe. We reckon of Physicions,
because the end of them is
health: of Lawyers, for they say
they produce quiet: of Souldiers,
for they purchase peace. Let vs
thinke thus of vertue, and wee
shall bee vertuous; temperance
first aspect is not to be valued, nor
his abstinence; but that the ende
of his abstinence giueth pleasure
a longer continuance then appetites
satisfaction: to this ende fortitude

embraceth perill & paines,
that hee may receiue a contentment,
more full and continuall
then a dastardly idlenesse: this is
the reason of vertues prohibition,
because shee would giue vs pleasure
and happinesse more lasting
and solide: who then will not restraine
the humorous wishes of
vice, since by that meanes he shal
obtaine vertue, and with her eternall
contentment.
               But yet hath man gotten but
one wing, with which though he
can flicker, and hoppe, yet can
he not flie: for himselfe, hee hath
ynough to serue his turne, but he
is borne to societie, and to helpe
others: to performe which, his other
wing is appointed, vertues
application; this is the wing of
splendor, the other is profitable,
so are the designes for a mans self;
but this leaneth to the good of others,

and is therefore commendable.
               Who applieth himselfe to his
countrey, with a minde applying
all things to vertue, he is so worthie,
as nothing originally of the
world more worthie: First, hee
beholdeth the state of the distressed,
hee redeemeth that, for
commiserations sake: Next, hee
vieweth the liues of his Countreymen,
whose swaruing crookednesse
hee amendeth, both by
counsell and example: Lastly, he
beholdeth forreine States, with
the eye of preuention, that no inuasions,
incrochings, or conspiracies,
disturbe the safetie of his
Common-wealth. I call this last,
because I will vnder these three
heads, mention what I thinke,
not doubting of many more respects
that belong to this life, nor
inforcing any mā to beleeue, that

these three comprehend the
summe of their duties; but thus
shall my sleight touch of these
passe his iourney.
               To commiserate the distressed I
estate of others, needs no great
perswasion, for all good natures
bring it with them from their
cradles; but I knowe not how,
great fortunes, and high estates,
so alter the dispositions of men, as
it deserueth a remembrance; for
nothing is more common, then
the prosperous to despise the distressed.
This commiseration
hath two meanes of performing
his function, to helpe the oppressed
by violence of men; and
the oppressed by the malignitie
of fortune: the former is iustice,
the last charitie. In this first ought
there to bee a freedome giuen to
Suitours, to enter both into
your gates and presence; mee

thinkes there cannot bee a more
vniust course, then to professe iustice,
and to denie suitours their
presence. How can hee know the
griefes of men without hearing
their cōplaints? Who deserues his
place, vnlesse ready to heare the
distresseds petitions? But these do
euill. Who will do well, let him
giue ready audience, and as ready
dispatch, without any other reward,
then the remembrance of
his good deed; with this hee must
be carefull of his seruants, lest
his authoritie and their couetousnesse
despoile not the poore,
and make them buy iustice at a
deare rate.
               For Charitie, it befitteth well
the life of aboundance to haue
recourse hither, but how to dispose
giftes, that they may rightly
deserue the name of Charitie, is
the difficultie. It is no charitie to

giue so violently as may waste the
maine of an estate; but what may
be spared, by cutting off superfluous
delicates & outward pompe,
to cōuert this to the poore distressed
outcasts of fortune, is true charitie.
I like not of feasting those
that are able to feast mee againe,
nor to keepe a table for all commers:
it is better to giue one his
dinner that knowes not elsewhere
to haue it, then twenty able to answere
feast with feast. I haue often
inueighed against our English second
courses, which kil many with
surfeits, whiles as many starue at
their gates with famine: I cannot
thinke of an Honourabler estate,
then to haue much, and yet to
liue temperately, depriuing themselues
of excesse to supply the
wants of others, which course
whosoeuer shall entertaine, shall
encrease his vertue, keepe his

body from diseases, and his fortune
from enuie.
               To make his countrey men
worthy of enioying their countrey,
and meete to preserue it,
there are two meanes, rewardes
and punishment. I spake lately
of charitie, which is to giue them
altogether in want; I speake now
of liberalitie, which is to giue
to them rich in vertues, but poore
in wealth: but to giue gifts as we
vse nowadaies in hope of a greater,
belongeth neither to liberalitie
nor charitie.
               Mee thinkes it becommeth
Magistrates to haue an eye aswell
to those of deserts and to cherish
them, as to bee inquisitiue about
offenders and their punishment.
It is not thus, and that it is
not, I thinke hath bene the greatest
cause of the decay of vertue:
for by this neglect, vertue hath

lost one of her meanes of perswasion,
and many woorthie
spirites haue runne out their liues
vnprofitably.
               I possesse as little of vertue,
as the most beggerly in that commoditie;
yet did I neuer see any
limme of her bodie, but I
was enamoured of it. Howe
much it would rayse the spirites
of worthie fellowes, and lift vp
declyning vertue, to haue great
men lend them good lookes,
and withall to displace Buffoones,
flatterers, and vnprofitable pleasures
of great charge, and to conuert
that to their vse, the proofe
will bee better beleeued then I;
yet in my opinion, this man should
bee as profitable to his countrey,
as the most vigilant, turning his
eyes to some other care.
               For punishment, the phisicke
of a State, it ought with asmuch

regard to bee looked into, as this
former, they are indeede to goe
arme in arme: of this part of iustice
since the direct meane is hardly to
bee obtained, I hold him the best
States-man, that leaneth rather to
seueritie, then to much lenitie; for
example, the vse of iustice doth
nothing so much harme with some
strict executions, as with letting
offenders escape without punishmēt:
law is the Load-stone, wherby
iustice saileth, and must be kept
in a venerable accompt: if the
crimes procuring them bee but
light, and not likely to impaire the
Common wealth much, it is better
not to see them, then seeing them,
to let them escape: for there is not
a more dangerous and disgraceful
thing to a Common wealth, then
to make lawes, and then suffer
them to lye vnprofitable without
execution. For forreine estates,

their force, the natures of the manages
of those forces, giueth the
eie of preuention the surest iudgement;
if their forces be of too great
strength, and to their strength
added a wise gouernour, there is
most danger: if these meete not,
no great perill when they doe: the
breeding the same ielousie in other
bordering Countreys that
your selfe conceiues, is a meanes
likely to make your strength able
to encounter him, but before this
time it had beene meete to haue
foreseene this danger, there being
no surer meanes to preuēt forreine
inuasions, then to keepe any one
from being too powerful; which is
easily done, by succouring the
weaker parts, but these are secrets
of which my writing is meere
presumption: for I hardly euer cary
any of my thoughts so high as
this meditation, more lowe flyeth

my conceit, and to the forme of
my life more profitably, in which it
may be, my sight can cary leuell as
far as need requireth; but in these
things I am altogether purblind.
               Non est ad astra mollis e terris via.
               It is not by the way of a downbed,
soft clothing, and delicacie;
much more on the right hand lyeth
the way to heauen: which
though those tender trauaillers,
that shape their course through sē
                  sualitie,
call hard, is not therefore
to be shunned: for the obtayning
set apart, which we allow painefull
in the attaining, the sleightest mysterie,
it is not hard, but easie and
pleasant, ioyned with such a contentment
and satisfaction, as is
past the power of any pennes expressing,
for it can be knowne neither
by words nor any resemblance,
but only it selfe is able to
expresse it selfe.
            
            
               
               Vpon these verses.
               
                  Res humanas ordine nullo
                  Fortuna regit, spargitque manu
                  Munera caeca, peiora fouens.
               
               THe giddy lightnesse, the vnresolued
motions, the vnsteady
fraile buildings of humane
actions: so fly, so stagger, so erect,
as no maruaile, if the worke which
alwayes resembles the crafts mans
skill, bee full of vncertainties and
wauerings: for how can weakenes
manage matters of strength? or
why should strength bee blamed,
if hee produceth not wisedome,
since nature, to preuent monsters,
hath appointed euery thing, to
beget things of his owne likenesse?
I can not call the actions
of men monsters, though monstrous:
for they resemble their mothers,
which is this body, it being

a fit resemblance me thinkes, since
all thoughts are bred betweene
the agitatiō of the soule and body,
to cal bodies females, the soule the
male, howe so euer the Grammarians
haue agreed vpon haec anima,
since hee is full of a more true and
Masculine force then the body.
               Res humanas.—
               Though we consist of a soule as
well as body, though his part be so
great in vs, as by it only we moue,
liue, and vnderstād, though he be
full of diuinitie, and loaden with
the riches of the place frō whence
he came; yet so much doeth the issue
of these two resemble the bodie,
as all our actions are called
humane; a word expressing frailtie
and death. That they are thus
called, and called so by their owne
deserts, proceedeth not from necesitie,

nor can I say in al through
the malice of choise, but through
the want of examining and weighing
our intendements, the lightest
of which are of so much weight, if
they were duely reckoned of, the
grauest, and lightest, so neere of
our kindred, and all so ready to lay
open thēselues, if questioned with
by a considerate iudgement; as
letting them passe thus carelessely,
shewes vs to bee both vnnaturall
and vnwise: for might the soule be
made acquainted with their sending
forth, she would giue them so
faire and lasting a constitution, as
they should bee no longer called
humane, but diuine actions.
               
                  —Ordine nullo
                  Fortuna regit.—
               
               That our actions are called, and
rightly called humane, here is the

reason; fortune gouernes them:
which word, though the fancy of
Poets hath giuen a bodie to, and
made her blinde, and a goddesse,
yet is she neither a goddesse, nor
a separated essence: for there are
millions of fortunes, yea as many
as there are men, euery man his
owne fortune; but the word expresseth
chance, and by chance
wee are gouerned, for so must
they needes bee that allowe not
their designes premeditatiō without
order: it is a shift to set vp
fortune, and the imputation of
fortunes preposterous and disorderly
working, it is our owne
fault; since nothing commeth
from vs marshalled with iudgement,
but as our sences catch vp
euery obiect destinated to their
functions, without all choyse or
regard: so suffer wee our selues
to ingrosse the commandements

of lust and appetite, to embrace
euery thing that they see, and to
deuoure poyson, so it promiseth
but sweetnes.
               I can not say wee goe without
meanings, but without the true
meaning I may: for superfluously
taking the suruey of things, not
penetrating the depth, wee neuer
taste of any thing but the scumme
and top of things. Hence come
the exclamations of the world, the
shipwrackes of all estates, and to
comprehend in a word that might
fill pages, all that we call calamity,
& think worthy of the bewayling.
               
                  —Spargitque manu
                  Munera caeca.—
               
               How my Tragedian meanes
here, I know not; but how I vnderstand
him, is thus equiuocall: hee
may call these gifts blind, by the
meanes of the obtayning, which

is by aduenture or may meane
them blinde, in respect of their
impotent insufficiencies; for so
examined straightly, must I confesse
these iewels of the world to
be, since they bring but thēselues,
not their vse, in which consists the
true spirit of the worthinesse of
things. Alas poore man, how art
thou deceiued, that sendes thy
minde to attend these things, that
ought to be the attendants of thy
minde? for what is thy vse of these
things, without a minde? and that
thou hast not, for already it is conuerted
into this drosse; the sicknesse
of which surfet, is the shipwracke
of the minde, vpon these
rockes of earth, they dissoluing the
substantiall body of humanitie,
into licentiousnesse, the pride
raised from the opinion of wealth,
prodigalities, loosenesse, couetousnesse,
extortion. It is meete

here also to tell those weake estimations,
that glory in those blind
gifts that childishly they account
of feathers and winde, and suffer
themselues to be transported out
of the Bay of iudgement, into the
vncertaine sea of opinion, by their
blinde and doting election.
               —Peiora fouens.
               It is no maruaile, since euery
thing hasteneth to the connexion
of his owne kinde, and
thus earth to earthly mindes; but
that spirits of a more true stampe,
enuie and mislike, that the
world is ingrossed by these, both,
I mislike and lament: for not
out of a minde that contemnes
because hee cannot obtaine, but
euen so neere trueth as to speake
what I thinke, I hold humane
prosperitie, the coyne currant

with our mortall states, no neerer
goodnesse, or happinesse,
then liuelesse things, whose motions
belong to our pleasure;
or otherwise so neere a kinne,
as a Stage to the Commedians,
which though it giues them a
faire and fit name, making them
apt for the eyes of men, yet is no
way guiltie of their good or euill
action.
               All things holde esteeme for
their vse, and this perswasion defendeth
the thirsters after excesses:
but if my vse bee sufficiently
supplyed, by a farre lesse number
of ceremonies, then serues
the nice and curious, me thinkes
my state is the better: for I mislike
nothing so much in shippes
and women, as their many tacklings:
to haue vse of so many
things, brings them to haue need
of many things. Then doubtlesse

their states are the miserablest,
and those most happy, that are
not impatient, with the seruice
of a lesse number of their implements.
               Then are not the wicked
and worser sort cherished, but
punished, in their abundaunce,
since like the throates of drunkards,
the more is powred in, the
more they thirst.
               There bee many vices that
wee bring with vs into the world,
and questionlesse wee had ynough
to doe, to maintaine warres with
them, procured wee no more:
but as many more are sprung
vp, out of this roote of abundance;
for from thence springeth
the particular malice of men, contentions,
slaunders, vnlawfull
wishes; after those put in practice,
in a word, abusing themselues
both in the obtaining and hauing:

so can I thinke it nothing but a
meanes of temptation to our best
part, and to the body a procurer
of enuie and danger.
               
                  Res humanas ordine nullo
                  Fortuna reget, spargitque manu
                  Munera caeca, peiora fouens.
               
               That this confusion is incident
to our liues, is our owne
fault, since the disorder of a State
belongeth to none, but to the
gouernours of a State; so this
to man who is Vicegerent of the
earth, the remedie may be imagined,
but (I doubt) not accomplished:
the disease by continuance
beeing past the power of curing,
the best phisick is contempt,
taken by a minde content vpon
contempts purge, to rectifie the

weake stomacke with the sucking
in a loue of a more noble nature,
whose counsell will expell confusion,
and take away the strength
of this iust inuectiue, or rather
true patterne of our vnhappie
condition.
               
                  Quicun
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      regno fidit, & magna
potens
                  Dominatur aula, nec leues metuit
Deos,
                  Animum
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      rebus credulum laetis
dedit,
                  Me videat, & te Troia, non vnquam
tulit
                  Documenta fors maiora, quam
fragili loco
                  Starent superbi:—
               
               WHatsoeuer holde the
world takes of the glittering

barkes of men; what honour
soeuer the base inferiours
cast vpon greatnesse, with what
pace soeuer hee treadeth, or with
what pompe soeuer he goeth, yet
is hee mortall, subiect to time, subiect
to desire, subiect to errours,
subiect to all the incidents, incident
to his subiect; and no more
doth death or destinie, or any of
those period-makers, spare him,
then the most abiect creature in
his dominion: but rather more
conuersant are dangers with
them, then any: for greatnesse
is subiect to enuie, and
enuie often the authour of destruction.
               Are kingdomes then such
holdes, as their possession shall
make vs proclayme warres against
God and man? or is power
so confidently to bee trusted,
as leaning vpon that pillar,

the warres of the world cannot
stirre vs? Who beleeueth so,
let him behold Troy, let him behold
Priam, let him behold Hector,
Cities too weake to resist ruine;
Principalitie, not able to shunne
the miserable parte of calamitie;
Valure made the footestoole of
the Conquerour. Which examples
if either by age thought
weake, or by passing through the
handes of a Poet, a fiction: let
it serue to stirre vp our memories,
which can produce examples
of these kindes more fresh,
and to our knowledge more
sure.
               All the things of this worlde,
being but the seruants of the bodie,
and the bodie of the soule,
howe base are they, that flie
their owne authoritie, and become
seruauntes to their seruauntes
seruaunt? and how

foolish are they that will make
these things destinated to this life,
longer-liued then mans life, to account
the needful helps of a mortall
body, immortall? yet doth the
erronious choise of the world set
vp these things aboue all respects;
preferre degrees of the world,
aboue the preferment of their
soule, setting vp power against
trueth; greatnesse of fortune, aboue
the puritie of a good conscience;
wealth against honestie;
gilded honour, aboue reall; the
applause of men, before the allowance
of vertue; the body, aboue
the soule; villanie, aboue
goodnesse; confusion, aboue
tranquillitie.
               
                  Quicun
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      regno fidit & magna
potens
                  Dominatur aula.—
               
               Whose thoughts soeuer shoots
so low, as to trust to any state of

the world, whose ignoble minde
doth so degenerate, as to fetch the
price of his estimation, from Heraldrie,
or the reuerence of basenesse,
can neither finde safetie in
his estate, trueth in his subiects,
nor quiet in his mind: how can he,
safetie, since he fetcheth his contentment
from the subiection of
inferiours? and they finding they
are vsed but for the foyles of his
magnificence, soone will they
spurne at such authoritie: for peace
and the combination of societies,
hath his originall from no other
ground, but the hope of a mutuall
supplying each others defects:
how can he, truth in his seruants,
since himselfe is the example of
the contrary? and no rigour can
forbid those meane states the following
the courses of their Gouernour;
admonition and punishment
neuer preuailing ouer example.

Lastly, the quiet of the
minde is not within the compasse
of the bodies authoritie, and hee
that knoweth nor trusteth to any
thing, but the seruants of the bodie,
how can he procure the quiet
of the minde? nothing can do this
but vertue, who sendeth the sweet
vapours of quiet to the minde, and
giueth it peace and rest; as the stomacke
doth to the head, to procure
sleepe the restorer of the body:
from nothing else is it to bee
had; for it is a forced contentment
to the minde, that is procured
from the fulnesse of the bodies
possession, not nourishing, but
dangerous; euen as the rest of
the bodie obtained by taking Oppium—&
magna potens
dominatur aula.—
               
               The possessions of a priuate
fortune, bee they neuer so great,
and neuer so ill vsed by the possessour,

is but a particular harme;
the possession of authoritie in the
court of Princes, swarueth it neuer
so little from the true bounds,
indangereth the whole state: it
little skilleth, whether a common
sayler be endued with any thing,
but strength; but if the Master or
Pilate bee not expert in his science,
rockes and tempests threaten
continually their destruction;
who is exalted to this state, by
any other but his owne deserts,
Phaeton-like, maketh his ambition
purchase his owne downefall, and
the fiering of the world. Were
there in this life no more to bee
done, but the resisting the allurementes
that the worlde casteth
vpon the height of his fortune,
doubtlesse he had much to doe; his
iudgement, his modestie, his vertue,
should be all employed; but
with this particular care, the

generall care commeth accompanied,
so is he doubly set a worke,
and more then doubly besieged
by false and deceiueable inticements.
Vnder these two heads
marcheth the glory and danger of
the fauorites of Princes, his fortune
not to corrupt himselfe, himselfe
not to corrupt the state: and
first, to the first, there is nothing
that is fedde with it owne humour,
but encreaseth and groweth
mightie, and at last dangerous;
thus things combustible,
heaped vpon fire, make it grow
furious and deuouring; thus waters
assembled together beyond
the bounds appointed by nature,
conspire to ouer-runne the earth.
The eyes of the people continually
obserue vpon whome the
Prince lookes fauourably: vpon
whom hee, they, like eyes vnable
to behold the Sunne, yet louing

light, bend themselues to behold
the Sunnes reflection; meeteth
this with an ambitious humour, it
swelleth him, and at last bursts
him: but meeting with a discreet
modestie, hee knoweth from
whence it commeth, and returneth
it thither againe. The loue
of the people deserued, and in
their hearts rather thē caps shewing
it, is a happie thing: but when
hee thus fauoured, cannot shew
himselfe any cause of their loue,
but his shewing them greatnesse,
it is dangerous. Princes hate competitors,
and popularitie in subiects
seemes to bandy with the
Prince in power, of which if
Princes be suspitious, and carefully
remoue the cause of their suspition,
they are not to bee blamed:
for as Caesar said of the putting away
his wife, hee did it, because
hee would not haue Caesars wife

somuch as suspected; well may
they diuorce from them such seruants,
for the suspition is more
dangerous. The vpright Statesman,
obseruing how subiect the
people are, to take ouer-kindly,
vpon the actions performed for
their good, by great men; truely
louing his Countrey, and respecting
his owne health, to all these
performances, hee should intitle
his Prince, and by all meanes
draw the people to acknowledge,
from him onely commeth all their
good and preseruation: thus shall
the loue betweene the Prince and
the people growe firme, from
which issueth the flourishing of
a State; of which hee hath not
onely part, but withall receiueth
the commendations due to a
speciall limme of so fayre a bodie.
               No lesse must these beware of

letting their preferments out-run
their deserts; Princes will growe
wearie of giuing, to them that are
still begging, and whatsoeuer
their bounties be, yet I thinke as
Phisitions of blood-letting, which
they say takes with that, that is superfluous,
some of the vitall parts;
so with their gifts, goeth some of
their loue, and the more that is taken,
the more of their loue is abated:
with this, degrees of honour
must be moderated; whatsoeuer
you may haue, must not bee reckoned,
but what is fitte: if sprung
from a progenie lately base and
obscure, high humours must by all
meanes be shunned, howsoeuer
borne; the safe rising, is leasurely
and by degrees, so as a high fortune
may not seeme strange,
and bee wondered at by the
world.
               When you make any suits, to

consider, whether it may not bee
offensiue to many, for in such
suits there is great losse and danger;
a moderation in pompe,
courtesie, rather for courtesies
sake them your owne, and still ending
all actions with your face
turned to your Prince, doing
good to the common wealth, but
desiring reputation from nobody
but your Soueraigne: howsoeuer
common men that know nothing
before effected, are gouerned by
the euent of things, yet must a iudiciall
States-man not builde his
counsels vpon these conditions:
that dangerous resolutions prospered
once, do not serue the second
time; from probabilitie
must he produce his aduice, and
sitting vpon his foundation, howsoeuer
it falleth our, hee is free of
a deserued imputation: for man
cānot diuine what end followeth

beginning, the neerest is a likelyhood,
which may faile without his
fault; for to propound, not to conclude,
is the destinie of man. To
beware of counselling any thing
tending to innouation, if the profit
ouer-valueth not the danger,
the thoughts of the vulgar, that
goeth no further commonly then
what they feele and see, the narrownes
of whose discourse, brings
them not acquainted with any
thing that they are not daylie
conuersant with, vtterly mislike
changes of importance, they that
doe not, it makes them delight in
them too much, and so is altogether
vnsafe to most of their dispositions.
               Nor in the particular customes
of men of these places, doth it
become grauitie to loue change,
especially the fashions of other
countries are most dangerous,

by which some will coniecture either
gaine, or lightnesse, or to
those forreiners an extraordinary
affection.
               All affection must bee abandoned,
not looking vpon any
thing with so true a desire of well
wishing, as vpon our countrey
and Prince.
               Thus shortly in generall, of
particulars to mention all, would
be too tedious; to mention some
without the whole, would be the
pourtraiture of a dismembred and
torne bodie; and to speake truely,
to mention all, is impossible: for
occasion begets them of infinite
formes, which when they happen,
are to be considerately caried,
without all affection, and
with all our iudgements.
               
                  
—Nec leues metuit Deus.
               How lightly are the imaginations
of man drawn to betray his
Master? more lightly, then feathers
and dust flie by the winde:
they flie and change their place,
when the ayre growes rough and
tempestuous.
               But caulmes as well as tempests,
carrie men vp and downe
in vncertainties.
               Caulmes, resembling prosperitie,
puffe him vp with pride, and
make him thinke better of his
owne state, then of all others;
loosing all respect of God and
man.
               The more tempestuous estate
of aduersitie, begettes despaire,
so doe our frayle thoughtes

fitte euery state with corrupt imaginations:
from no fortune is
the tranquillitie of the minde
produced; the minde manageth,
obeyeth not the states of the
worlde: wherefore that common
opinion that accompanieth fond
desires of determining, if the imagined
good were obtained, we
should be happie and at peace, is
so farre from trueth, as with nothing
so much satisfaction, we beholde
thinges in our power, as
they farre off, which wee cannot
reach with our hand, but
thought.
               Religion, the lymiter of mans
progressions, the anchour-hold
of our soules, and preseruation
of our bodies, by the immeasureable
fawnings of fortune, is often
to embrace her giftes let goe,
but how foolish is this choise,
since without Religion, euen

those esteemed giftes are not to
bee inioyed? for wrongs and oppression
would soone confound
meum & tuum: For no Lawes
of man, not esteemed depending
vpon the Lawe of GOD, can
bee kept vnuiolable: it is not
true that the rayes of this light are
onely reflected vpon our soules:
no sure, God made both body and
soule, and hath a care of both: for
such are all the commandements
giuen to man, as the best Politician
for the vpholding Common-wealths,
can not imagine rules
more profitable and safe. There is
no fortune that can stand without
religion, and without a veneration
and feare of the diuine powers;
the societies of men will perish,
yea, euen euery man: for were his
thoughts able to flie no further
then this life, the stop would confound
his vnderstanding, which

now though but in hope, yet that
hope brought to an assured confidence,
is the best contentment:
for what mortall thoughts may equall
the thoughts of Eternitie?
               
                  Animumque rebus credulum
laetis dedit,
                  Me videat, & te Troia.—
               
               What perswasiō can conuert infectious
minds possessed of things
apt to feed the affection? Nothing
can withstād their obstinacies; for
the corrupt humor reignes, & reason
is despised: the neglect of whō,
and the beliefe of the other is credulitie,
a light trust, vnacquainted
with iudgement. Thus the trust
giuen to the world and fortune,
whose transitorines, though al the
counsellers and rulers of our mortall
vnderstandings testifie, and
explaine, yet can wee finde contentment

and pleasure in their
possession, though Diuinitie saith,
both we and they are but dust, it
helpeth not; Philosophie sheweth
his originall and downefall so
certainely, as if neuer none had
died, we could not hope to liue euer,
yet preuaileth it not: though
Hystorie presents the ruine of
Empires, Cities, and men of the
highest erected States haue died,
and some of them most miserably,
it auayles not: Lastly, though our
own experience seeth death & destruction
ruinating all things, & al
men, yet will we not beleeue but
there is pleasure and contentment
in the gifts of fortune, credulously
giuing credit to the base perswasion
of our affections.
               Animum
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   rebus credulum laetis
dedit.
               Mirth, pleasure and ioy, differ
much in nature; frō ye credulity ye
                  
these thinges are pretious and of
worth, mirth may be fetched, from
their vse pleasure; so may myrth
and pleasure serue honest masters,
for they are ruled by their gouernours;
but ioy will not bee abused,
nor euer attend any thing not truly
and indeede precious: then can
not the lightnesse of these beget
ioy, who, as one saieth, is a graue
thing, but myrth & pleasure they
may: but they are pricelesse things,
accompanied with as much mutabilitie
and transitorinesse as their
procurer.
               Me videat, & te Troia.—
               Behold two mothers, rich in
these possessions, in the smal space
of ten yeeres made the most miserable:
behold Hecuba, a princesse,
in her youth made happy, with hauing
magnificence and principalitie,

accompanied with her youth:
in her age possessed of mortall immortalitie,
of all the graces that
raigne in man, in a small space, in
lesse then a moment respecting
Eternitie, throwne from this esteemed
height, and made neither
princesse nor mother; thus Troy,
the famousest citie of the world
most abounding, defaced and ruinated
and left desolate of all but
blood and ashes: this the vngouerned
flattery of greatnes procured:
here is powers common generation,
begetting sensualities
and vnbridled appetite, frō whose
transitorinesse and cause of disolution,
be it a fiction, yet may we gather
here.
               
                  —Non vnquam tulit
                  Documenta fors maiora, quam
fragili loco
                  Starent superbi.—
               
               Since the mutabilitie of the

world is such, & that ye world could
not be a world, nor stand, were she
not supplied by the transitorinesse
of things, resoluing one thing into
another: how can our opinions be
so forcible, as to hold any of this
rancke deare or pretious? nay, how
so monstrous, as to perswade vs to
pride; a vice full of the most dangerous
effects? for to greatnesse it
procureth hatred; to meane estates
derision; to none safetie: a
lazie affection, that taketh no
pleasure, but within doores: a
pricelesse affection, for it is currant
with none but our selues: an
effeminate affection, for it is still
looking in the glasse of selfe-loue:
in a word; an affection, making
vs vnsociable, and our conuersations
loathsome.
               Standing in this vncertaine
state, who would not gouerne
and prepare himselfe fitte for another?

This cannot pride; for his
loftei behauiour and stiffe rebellious
thoughtes cannot nimbly
shift the fall of fortune: it is therefore
a vice of all others to be shunned.
For besides it is a sinne, and
so contrary to goodnesse; and being
contrary, must needes bee offensiue,
in this world it is also dangerous,
seldome going without
punishment and destruction.
               Inertis est nescire quid liceat
sibi.
               NO knowledge is vnfruitfull,
so liberally hath nature dealt
with al things: but ye life of man being
appointed but a short course,
and the course of a general knowledge
beeing too long, the knowledges
most pertinent to himselfe,
are to bee chosen, which hardly

shall he ende before his course be
ended: so much is there to be read
in himself, & about himself. Farre
otherwise hath it happened with
some mindes, who thirstie ynough
of knowledge, haue fixed their indirected
steppes vpon arts vnprofitable,
considering the shortnes of
our liues, whose swiftnesse giues
vs warning to entertaine the most
profitable and soonest digested
knowledges, both which are
things belonging to life: otherwise
we may fall into their errors, that
die good Astronomers, and euill
men. Three are the knowledges
destinated to our vse; the knowledge
of our selues, the knowlege
of our fortune, the knowledge of
our countrey, when by the smart
of experience, for by counsell or
good inclination few atteine to it,
neither is it so much worth, for
that of counsaile hath too light an

impression, good inclinations naturally
are giuen none, but to such
as are of a dull heauy disposition:
but whē experience hath made vs
feele, how subiect our courses are
to errors, the best meanes is vnpartially
to make our heads take
account of our daies progressions:
this euery day, so shall not the
number of our vices confound our
memories, and make the account
difficult, nor shall this age make
them strong & hard to vanquish,
the beginning of things beeing
within the compasse of curing,
their continuance incurable. At
no time is this Audit to bee better
cast vp, then when the daies circuit
is finished: for in the sunnes presence,
the conscience dealeth not
so forcibly with our offences, but
night worketh vpon guiltines, and
in darkenes the terror of an euill
life is best seene; then also is the

pleasure of the sinne commonly
most remote, a time yeelding the
right opportunitie for amendement;
for in the absence of the
pleasure, and presence of the smart
incident to that pleasure, is the
true time of conuersion.
               In this search and examination
of our selues, wee must beware
of mistaking things: a thing carefully
to be regarded, since louing
our selues, and rich in the commodities
of names, wee seeke not
to shelter crueltie in iustice, couetousnes
in thrift, cowardice in prouidence:
this flattery of our selues
is like the medicynes of wandering
Emperickes, which cure not,
but respit paine, which time expired,
the paine & dāger is doubled,
neither must wee let the successe
blindfold vs; it is an ignorant
accompt that is taken at the
end ofthings: with the beginnings

let them begin, that are so valiant
as to defye fortune, for meaning
well, the euent can not bee euill:
hee that armes his intent with vertue,
is inuincible: the trauels
guided by any other starre, howe
succesful soeuer for a time, yet end
miserably. Hauing found our defects,
the gallantest course is resistance;
the safest, shunning, but because
wee are not priuie to all the
occurrents of the world, wee must
fetch this safetie from resistance,
and yet when wee can, to shunne
causes of prouocation.
               In the search of our selues,
when wee haue found some, wee
must not leaue, for wee haue
many: nor when wee haue found
many: looke no further; for
yeeres and the change of fortune,
bring with them newe dangers,
which is daily seene: many licētious
youths, ending with ambitious

ages; many humble poore men
hauing proued tyrannicall and
proud in riches.
               The last of our inward inquisition,
is, after the true sight of our
selues, to propound no course beyond
the power of our managing:
if nature hath laid greater strēgth
vpon my armes, then head, I will
confesse it, and frame my selfe to
bee profitable that way: if in my
head, that way; if I can not spinne,
I wil reele and bunch hempe: thus
is the fault, if there bee a fault, natures
and not mine, if ambition
caryeth me beyond the compasse
of vnderstanding.
               For our states, if there were no
body wiser then I, the Lawe of a
Common-wealth that bound euery
man to follow the fortune
of his father, should bee well
thought of, so should the Common-wealth
know to whom to

trust, and her constitution be more
setled, then the giuing euery
man his choyse, by which riches
make some lazie; pouertie some
industrious; wealth giueth estimation;
estimation is sought to
for their Counsaile, and their
wisedomes lye onely in their Inuentoryes.
All this time vertue
is not thought of, nor their
aduices are of moment: for they
are drowned in parsimony.
               I like well of thrift, and that we
should know the secretes of our
fortune, howe much wee are
able to spende, and howe wee
ought to spende, in which I allowe
not the liuing at the vttermost:
it is a dangerous custome,
that because a Gentleman or Noble,
and of this liuing, wee must
goe braue and entertaine all, and
saue nothing. I doe hate being at

the appointment of others, especially
to bee bound to followe euill
counsaile: there is liberalitie
and charitie to performe, which euery
man is bound to, and to performe
which, other superfluous
costs must bee omitted: it is better
to keepe pouertie from staruing,
thē to feast knaues: which if it
bee misliked for the vertue, shall
fit some for the thrift: fortie shillings
goeth further amongst the
poore, then doubled spent in feasting
the rich.
               More of this I will not treat of,
but onely to restraine our mindes
from looking licorishly vpon any
other estate, then that our Ancestors
liued in: for besides that the
shortnesse of our life giues vs not
leasure, hauing businesse of more
importance to dispatch first, it
beeing better to bee an honest

man then a great man, it is too
dearely bought: for as fast as they
pursue promotion, danger, enuie,
and death pursue them, and
not one amongst numbers but is
ouertaken.
               I do not so often pray for raine
and fayre weather, as I doe that
my countrey men should deserue
it: for we are fallen into the iawes
of the Prouerbe, Better fed, then
taught: an error that will fall foule
vpon the higher degrees: for speaking
generally of the multitude;
they are a people tractable, and
ready ynough to bee better then
they are, if taught, which they can
not receiue by their education, because
their pouertie empoyl
                     •
                  s thē
about other businesse: they that
may, should giue thē the short and
sure precepts of good example,
and so the ones education shall
shew it self answerable to his birth,

the other bee recompenced for
their obedience, by beeing instructed
in the rules of life.
               Many times I haue thought of
these degrees of state; of them wee
cal noble and ignoble: and though
my opinion iumpe with the allowance
of degrees and titles, yet am
I sory that the rewardes of the
promoted should bee an inheritance,
and the deserts separated:
but in such a state is this earth, that
the fauour of time and continuance
is abused, and the smiles
of fortune nourisheth the worst
counsaile.
               The knowledge of our Countrey,
a booke worthy to bee read
with attention, consisteth in these
diuersities; her Commodities,
her Situation, her people: though
I doubt not but nature prouided
euery Countrey of sufficient
prouision for her owne burthen,

yet hath the delicacie of man striuen
with nature, that hee might
want: so are our minds like emptie
caskes; as they full of winde,
so we ful of windie wishes: and all
like women with childe, like nothing,
but what is hard to come
by. Of the commodities, the
best is bullion and munition, the
worst clothes and victuall: so may
I say for our kingdome, the worst
commodities that enter it being
the foode of wantonnesse, not of
necessitie, and clothes: the other
borrowed superfluitie, wee haue
little need of, our owne countrey
yeelding attire both coole and
warme: for these, wee part with
marchandize of no lesse importance,
and some of more; but this
is now to bee talked of onely: for
time hath made it vnalterable,
onely the excesse is to be preuented,
and those things able to bee

dangerous, carefully to be preserued,
lest we make our Countrey
so vnhappie, as to beare children
that will ruine her. The Situation
knowne, recompenseth the
knowledge, with beeing able to
prouide against all inconueniences:
as to fitte our diets to the Climate,
our forces to the strength,
our spendings and commings in:
Thus shortly and generally for
the particularitie, it must come
from the nominating the place.
The knowledge of the peoples
natures, is of much importance,
both in the vsing them vpon occasion,
and applying lawes to
them: both which cannot bee
rightly executed, without first
their natures be knowne & measured.
Thus important is the
knowledge of our selues, and
those thinges belonging to our
selues, which who neglecteth, deserueth

the Tragedians title, being
a creature altogether vnprofitable
and vnworthie.
               
                  Magis haec timet, quam moeret, ingenio
est opus:
                  Alios parentes alloqui luctu decet.
               
               So are we gouerned by our affections,
as our intents speake in
face: so vngouerned are our affections,
as what they would shun,
they run into; they see but themselues,
and beholding nor knowing
nothing else, doe like themselues,
easily discouering what
they wish most secret. It is the discourse
of the minde onely, that is
able to see and shunne danger at
once, the others see it not with discretion,
but feare, whose nature
wisheth a dispatch without regard,
whether it be with a cut throat or
safetie; feares furthest with being
but to bee out of his paine.

Since these affections are so fixed
to men, as there is no man without
them; since the suppressing of
them is so rare, as hardly it belongeth
to any man, there is no action
almost, that can escape a wise
obseruation; for hee is ledde to
them, by them that seeke most to
keepe them in couert: like vnto
the care that other creatures haue
of their young ones, which care
carieth their pursuer to their nest
or caue. For bee it an attempt,
wherein the attempter beleeueth
great matters of profite will follow;
hope outrunnes it selfe, ouerweigheth
him, and beeing vnaccustomed
to carie so high sailes,
sheweth he hath determined some
strange things: thus feare, thus
loue, thus hatred, thus all make
the faces of men, in spite of their
hearts, goe to confession.
               
                  
Magis haec timet, quam moeret.—
               There is no humane action,
that is deliuered to the worlde,
without many circumstances:
there is no circumstance, but is a
steppe, mounting the vnderstanding
to the truth. Wherefore, the
true Inquisitour ought not to
thinke any thing impertinent,
that is any way pertinent: for how
he spake, how he looked, how he
companied, and euen lighter then
these may carrie a reach, able to
weigh these things into the most
secret part of the secret: for these
are threeds, leading into the labyrynth,
which who omitteth, and
catcheth at the body of an action,
without ioyning and laying together
the other circumstances, shall
as often misse as hit, & oftner erre,
then come to his wished purpose.
               
                  
Ingenio est opus.
               There needes no more affection,
then will giue vs taste of our
purposes; affections vse, is like
the vse of a wherstone for a knife,
onely to giue it an edge, and then
lay it by, for vse it continually or
oft times, it maketh the mettal
thinne and weake; and thus affection
doth to men: what can we
doe, whereof done, wee are not
ashamed? except managed by
wisedome, euen from the most
triuiall to the most serious perfourmances.
Ingenio est opus.
Which excellent guide of our
actions, who desireth to obtaine,
must not suffer the allurements of
his affections to lay hold on him,
for then they shall accompanie
this vnhappie weake woman:
               
                  
Magis haec timet, quam moeret.—
               Affectionate passion is both
deformed and vnsafe.
               Alios parentes alloqui luctu decet.
               No where hath affection that
power, nor any where doe they
display themselues so openly, as
the affection of parents to their
children; they were begotten by
affection, and by affection they
are maintained: for let them bee
how they will, though deformed
both in minde and bodie, yet will
they finde a louelinesse in their
out-blemishes, and tolerate their
inward; which if nature hath not
appointed to keepe the increase of
the world from miscarrying, certainely
it is a fault: for sincere
trueth alloweth nothing that

cannot produce the graces of the
mind for euidence. It becommeth
parents mourning, to speake in
no other fashion: it becommeth
parents that will bee parents and
wise, not to mourne at all; for
there is no more allowed to parents
or children, in the exact
rules of wisedome, then there is
to causes farther off but speaking
of the exact commandements of
wisedome, causes stand all in a distance,
there is none neerer or
more remote: so should euery
one, that will do well, lament his
neighbours childe as much as his
owne; but neither should wee for
theirs nor ours: for that is a weaknesse,
and the defectiue part of our
natures, we must seeke to recouer
thē, which we say are in calamitie:
but the pitie of teares is too waterish
to do good; bewailing being
an vnnecessary slothfull affection.
               
                  
                  —Gladius & spes & metus,
                  Sors caeca versat: praemium incertum
petit
                  Certum scelus.—
               
               HOw can it otherwise be, when
reason yeeldes the prioritie to
strength, an vnreasonable & blind
iudge, but that chance should
haue a hand in the euent? and
where chāce hath any thing to do,
who seeth not, that the vncertainty
of the cōclusion must needs beget
hope and feare? for such thoughts
alwaies follow attempts, where the
iudgements of men are barred of
a certaine censure.
               Warre is the remedy for a
State surfetted with peace, it is
a medicine for Common-wealths
sicke of too much ease and tranquilitie,
but that it carrieth a reforming

nature, and is a part of iustice;
yet is it better knowen then
vsed, better to keepe in awe then
to punish; for it can hardly bee taken
vp or pacified, since it begets
in Generals the two dāgerous humours
of reuenge and ambition;
in the limmes obeying this head,
dissolutenes and riot: betweene
which, and the heate of contention,
the innocent perish aswell as
the guiltie, and in stead of reforming
nations, they depopulate thē;
yet these inconueniences make
me not wholy deny warres profitable:
for they were most profitable,
if the distressed had but the
opiniō, that the recourse to warres
would auaile them: for without
this, licentiousnesse and tyranny
would deuoure all, and without
this, desperation would seize vpon
all in calamity: for despaire possesseth

none that can haue recourse
to any remedy, but onely those
that are without all refuge. But
warres best vse, is the same that
Nurses make of Robin Goodfellow,
to terrifie, and the example
much more safe and wholesome
that is taken from the sight of our
neighbours, then from our owne
experience.
               
                  —Praemium incertum petit
                  Certum scelus.—
               
               Did not this take away admiration
with beeing ordinarie, it
were a wonder, an vncertaine
gaine purchased with a certaine
euill: there is nothing shewes me
the vitiousnesse of man, so plainely
as this, vndertaking courses so
desperately and vainely, as if his
intent were nothing els, but to increase

his sinnes. I see offendors
dayly, and they see the shame and
bitternesse of punishment, yet can
not this perswade them; so that I
cannot say, looking into their intentions,
without all respect but
of their gaine and losse, that euer
I sawe any, whose profit could recompence
their losse.
               Omitting petty matters, in
that execrable wickednes of conspiring
against Princes, I wonder
not that such intendements finde
Heads; for the profit of the gayne
may corrupt men: but how the other
limmes are drawne in, I maruaile,
for they aduenture as much
as the principall, and let his designe
come to passe, are vncertaine
of their reward, yea, of their
life: for such benefites that are not
easily to bee recompenced, are as
dangerous as iniuries. It is a wonder

then, and either these men
flatter thēselues with vaine hopes,
strengthning which with their
will, they resist the more reasonable
discourse, or els heat with the
allurement of some affection, run
into them without al examination;
both of which are so dangerous,
as the day of vndertaking such attempts,
they may, without being
deceiued in their computation,
reckon the day of their ruine: for
it is hard to iudge of which side he
is in most danger, but of one vndoutedly
he shall perish.
               In this and in all other the
gaine is vncertaine, the euill
certaine, which (mee thinkes)
should alone perswade vs, and
make all wickednesse despised:
were the cōdition, For the losse of
the one, here is the other, we were
neerer temptation: but the eternal

goodnesse hath remoued it further
off, I doubt not, to no other end,
but to withdrawe all occasions
meete to nourish the corrupt humours
of our natures, by which
if wee will not yet take warning,
but hunt out vice hidden
from vs, wee are vnworthie of
pitie, yea, of the common pitie,
that followeth the alreadie ouerthrowne.
               Ferre, quam sortem patiuntur omnes,
nemo recusat.—
               WEe haue nothing formed
in the true moulde, wee
carrie sometimes actions bearing
a handsome glosse, but they are
no neerer trueth, then a picture
the life: what wee should fetch
frō the vnderstanding the mutabilitie
of things, wee draw frō the

marrow-fretting sore of enuie; so
what might bee a vertue by the
suffering, is a vice: for not suffering
for the true cause, and the
strength enduring aduersitie, is
not patience, since patience is
founded in the true discourse of
the minde, this fetcht from the
sight of others miseries. Euery
particular bodie feeles his owne
affliction: the affliction of others
is no medicine curing his; yet
from the aduerse fortune of others
can wee drawe comfort: what
helpes it vs to be richly indowed
with reason, since we vse nothing
but fancie? for this is fancie, and
this is so in most things, being caried
vp and downe with her lightnesse,
without all rest and permanencie.
               
                  
Ferre, quam sortem patiuntur omnes,
nemo recusat.—
               What all suffers, no bodie refuseth
to suffer: no more should we
what we allow; there is this onely
good to be had in aduersitie; the
obseruation how it befel: if by our
owne negligence, it begettes experience;
if past our knowledge,
so much resistance as leades to patience,
is allowed; but repining
and sorrow, vnprofitable vexations,
rather stirring the diuine
powers to a more sharpe punishment,
then mitigating the calamitie.
There is nothing in this
world erected so high as man; so
nothing more subiect to fall: there
is nothing so ill as man; therefore
more due to him, then to any: nothing
so sensible; therefore nothing
more apt to feele affliction:

and as for Chance and Fortune,
they are words founded vpon two
reasons, sometimes in excuse,
when we lay our deserued afflictions
vpon fortune: sometimes
when the diuine executions are aboue
mans, which though we call
chance, yet doubtlesse is founded
vpon grounds of more excellent
reason, then we can apprehend: so
is chance the issue of follie or ignorance.
