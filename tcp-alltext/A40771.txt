               WHy ſhould I thus complain, on thee
               So cruelly thou murdereſt me,
               For unto thee it is well known,
               Thou art the Maid I love alone,
            
            
               In none but thee I take delight,
               I think on thee both day and night;
               I give to thee my heart away,
               Do not with hatred me repay,
            
            
               When firſt thy ſweet face I did ſee,
               I thought thot none was like to thee;
               I wiſh I had not ſeen the day,
               When firſt thou ſtol'ſt my heart away.
            
            
               Hard is thy heart, harder then ſteel,
               Colder then Ice, that froſt congeal;
               How many thouſand times doth make,
               My heart to bleed for thy ſweet ſake.
            
            
               
            
            
               I was forewarned by thine eyes,
               Of thy moſt killing Cruelties,
               But Cupid hath ſo blinded me.
               Now I ſhall dye for love of thee;
            
            
               But O how good had been my caſe,
               That I had never ſeen thy face,
               My captive heart had then been free,
               But now I can love none but thee.
            
            
               When I am dead, this thou wilt ſay,
               That I have caſt my love away;
               Too late 'twill be then to complain,
               If that you do, it's all in vain.
            
            
               Therefore my deareſt Love comply,
               Aud caſe me of this cruelty;
               Let not me dye in this diſpair,
               But grant thy love to me my dear.

                  DOubt not my Love, nor do not fear,
                  Thou art the man that I love dear,
                  I did but try thy conſtancy,
                  For I do love no man but thee.
               
               
                  Then grieve no more, nor yet complain,
                  Thy love to me is not in vain:
                  For conſtant I will ever be,
                  And I do lovt no man but thee.
               
               
                  Wy ſhouldſt thou ſay thy hart will break
                  And all for love of my ſweet ſake,
                  I conſtant to thee ſtill will prove,
                  As ever was the Turtle-Dove.
               
               
                  Nothing ſhall part my Love and I,
                  Vntil the very day we dye:
                  We'l live in love, and ſo agree,
                  As man and wife they ought to be.

                  O thanks be to the Heaven above,
                  Now I have gain'd my deareſt Love,
                  Thy words doth me ſo much revive,
                  I am the happieſt man alive.
               
               
                  Come let us to the Church away,
                  And married be without delay:
                  Although our Portions be but ſmall,
                  True love is better worth then all.
               
               
                  So hand in hand away they vvent,
                  And had their parents free confent:
                  The muſick then moſt ſvveet did Play,
                  And thus ended their Wedding day.
               
               
                  Young-men and maids in love agree,
                  And let thes ſong a pattern be:
                  The price you knovv it is but ſmall,
                  A penny a piece, and take them all.
               
               FINIS.
