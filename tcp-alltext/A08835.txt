of euyll maryage,
            
               
            
            
               
               
                  TAke hede and lerne thou lytell chylde and ſe
               That tyme paſſed wyl not agayne retourne
               And in thy youthe vnto vertues vſe the

               That in thyne aege thou haue no cauſe to mourne
               For tyme loſt nor for defaute of wytte

               Glorye vnto god / louynge and benyſon
               To Peter and Iohan and alſo to Laurence
               Whiche haue me take vnder proteccyon
               From the deluge of mortall peſtylence
               And from the tempeſt of deedly vyolence
               And me preſerue that I fall not in the rage
               Vnder the bonde and yocke of maryage
            
            
               I was in purpoſe to haue taken a wyfe
               And for to haue wedded without auyſednes
               A full fayre mayde with her to lede my lyfe
               whome that I loued of haſty wylfulnes
               with other fooles to haue lyued in dyſtreſſe
               As ſome gaue me counſeyle & began me to conſtrayne
               To haue be partable of theyr woofull payne
            
            
               They laye vpon me and haſted me full ſore
               And gaue me counſeyle for to haue be bounde
               And began to prayſe eche daye more and more
               The woofull lyfe in whiche they dyd habounde
               And were beſy my gladnes to confounde
               Themſelfe reioyſynge bothe at euen and morowe
               To haue a felowe to lyue with them in ſorowe
            
            
               
               But of his grace god hath me preſerued
               By the wyſe counſeyle of theſe aungelles thre
               From hell gates / they haue my lyfe conſerued
               In tyme of warre whan louers luſty
               And bryght phebus was freſſheſt vnto ſe
               In gemynys the luſty and glad ſeaſon
               whan to wedde caught fyrſt occaſyon
            
            
               My ioye was ſette in eſpecyall
               To haue wedded one excellent in fayrnes
               And thrugh her beaute haue made my ſelfe thrall
               Vnder the yocke of euerlaſtynge dyſtreſſe
               But god alonely of his hygh goodnes
               Hath by an aungell as ye haue herde me tell
               Stopped my paſſage / from that peryllous hell
            
            
               Amonge theſe aungelles that were in nombre thre
               There appered one out of the ſouthe
               whiche ſpake fyrſt of all to the trynyte
               All of one ſentence the mater is full couthe
               And he was called Iohan with the golden mouthe
               whiche concluded by ſentence full notable
               wyues of cuſtome ben gladly varyable
            
            
               After this Iohan the ſtory ſayth alſo
               In confyrmacyon of theyr fragylyte
               How that Peter called acorbylio
               Affermeth playnly how that wyues be
               Dyuerſe of herte full of duplycyte
               Mayſterfull haſty and eke proude
               Crabbed of langage whan they lyſt crye aloude
            
            
               
               Who taketh a wyfe receyueth a greate charge
               In whiche he is full lyke to haue a fall
               with tempeſt toſſed as is a beſy barge
               There he was free he maketh hymſelfe thrall
               wyues of porte ben full Imperyall
               Huſbandes dare not theyr luſtes gaynſaye
               But louely pleaſe and mekely them obaye
            
            
               The huſbandes euer abydeth in trauayle
               One labour paſſed there cometh another newe
               And euery daye ſhe begynneth a batayle
               And in complaynynge chaungeth chere and hewe
               Vnder ſuche falſues ſhe fayneth to be true
               She maketh hym rude as is a dull aſſe
               Out of whoſe daunger impoſſyble is to paſſe
            
            
               Thus wedlocke is an endleſſe penaunce
               Huſbandes knowe that haue experyence
               A martyrdom and a contynuaunce
               In ſorowe euerlaſtynge a deedly vyolence
               And this of wyues is gladly the ſentence
               Vpon theyr huſbandes whan they lyſt to be bolde
               How they alone gouerneth the houſholde
            
            
               And yf her huſbande happen for to thryue
               She ſayth it is her prudent purueyaunce
               If they go abacke ayenwarde and vnthryue
               She ſayth it is his myſgouernaunce
               He bereth the blame of all ſuche ordynaunce
               And yf they be poore and fall in dyſtreſſe
               She ſayth it is his foly and lewdneſſe
            
            
               
               And yf ſo be he be no werkman good
               It may well happe he ſhall haue an horne
               A large bone to ſtuffe with his hood
               A mowe behynde and fayned chere beforne
               And yf it fall that theyr good be lorne
               By auenture eyther at euen or morowe
               The ſely huſbande ſhall haue all the ſorowe
            
            
               An huſbande hath greate cauſe to care
               For wyfe / for chylde / for ſtuffe and meyne
               And yf ought lacke ſhe wyll bothe ſwere and ſtare
               He is a waſtour and ſhall neuer the
               And Salomon ſayth there be thynges thre
               Shrewde wyues / rayne / and ſmokes blake
               Make huſbandes ofte theyr houſes to forſake
            
            
               Wyues be beeſtes very vnchaungeable
               In theyr deſyres whiche may not ſtaunched be
               Lyke a ſwalowe whiche is inſacyable
               Peryllous caryage in the trouble ſee
               A wawe calme full of aduerſyte
               whoſe blandyſſhynge endeth with myſchaunce
               Called Cyrenes euer full of varyaunce
            
            
               They them reioyce to ſe and to be ſene
               And for to ſeke ſondrye pylgrymages
               At greate gaderynges to walke on the grene
               And on ſcaffoldes to ſytte on hygh ſtages
               If they be fayre to ſhewe theyr vyſages
               And yf they be foule of loke or countenaunce
               They it amende with pleaſynge dalyaunce
            
            
               
               And of profyte they take but lytell hede
               But loketh ſoure whan theyr huſbandes ayleth ought
               And of good mete & drynke they wyll not fayle in dede
               what ſo euer it coſt they care ryght nought
               Nor they care not how dere it be bought
               Rather than they ſholde therof lacke or myſſe
               They wolde leuer laye ſome pledge ywys
            
            
               It is trewe I tell you yonge men euerychone
               women be varyble and loue many wordes and ſtryfe
               who can not appeaſe them lyghtly or anone
               Shall haue care and ſorowe all his lyfe
               That woo the tyme that euer he toke a wyfe
               And wyll take thought and often muſe
               How he myght fynde the maner his wyfe to refuſe
            
            
               But that maner with trouth can not be founde
               Therfore be wyſe or ye come in the ſnare
               Or er ye take the waye of that bounde
               For and ye come there your ioye is tourned vnto care
               And remedy is there none ſo may I fare
               But to take pacyens & thynke none other way aboute
               Than ſhall ye dye a martyr without ony doute
            
            
               Therfore you men that wedded be
               Do nothynge agaynſt the pleaſure of your wyfe
               Than ſhall you lyue the more meryly
               And often cauſe her to lyue withouten ſtryfe
               without thou arte vnhappy vnto an euyll lyfe
               Than yf ſhe than wyll be no better
               Set her vpon a lelande and bydde the deuyll fet her
            
            
               
               Therfore thynke moche and ſaye nought
               And thanke god of his goodneſſe
               And prece not for to knowe all her thought
               For than ſhalte thou not knowe as I geſſe
               without it be of her owne gentylneſſe
               And that is as moche as a man may put in his eye
               For yf ſhe lyſt of thy wordes ſhe careth not a flye
            
            
               And to conclude ſhortly vpon reaſon
               To ſpeke of wedlocke of fooles that be blente
               There is no greter grefe nor feller poyſon
               Nor none ſo dredefull peryllous ſerpent
               As is a wyfe double of her entent
               Therfore let yonge men to eſchewe ſorowe and care
               withdrawe theyr fete or they come in the ſnare
            
            FINIS.
