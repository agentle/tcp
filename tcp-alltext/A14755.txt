THE KINGS
MOST SACRED
MAIESTIE.

               Gratitude is a rich, and
royall Vertue best beseeming
the best Princes,
which haue the best
meanes to expresse, and
the most cause to excite
them thereunto. The
meanest Subiect following
the Mill, may bee
as thankefull as the greatest
Monarch sitting
vpon the Throne. But
between the effects of their
thankes, there is as broad
a difference, as betweene

the Acts of a Gyant, and
a Creeple, whose fortitude
may yet bee equall.
A priuate man praiseth
God vpon a tenne-stringed,
a King vpon a ten-thousand-stringed
Instrument,
vpon the lowd-sounding
Organs, hauing so
many millions of Pipes,
as there bee men to whom
their Authoritie, or Example
reacheth. The
fruites of Constantine,
Theodosius, and such

good Emperors gratitudes,
haue been Religion planted
and promoted, Churches
erected, Idolatrie
suppressed, wholesome
Lawes enacted, and executed,
which makes Diuines
doubt whether such
Kings were well aduised,
Elesban Rex Aethiopum. Niceph. lib. 17. Fernandus Rex Castiliae, Rodoricut de rebus Hispanicis, lib. 4. Fox To, 1. Martyrolog. though much applauded
in Storie, who vpon victories
obtained, not layed
downe onely, but wholly
layd off their Crownes,
and resigned their Kingdomes

to God, not considering
they might better
haue paid their thankes
to him in kind, as Kings;
then in priuate deuotions
as Monkes. Dauid
was therefore a man after
Gods heart, not because
a King, but because
a thankefull King:
the sweet Singer of Israel,
not for his Poetry or
Musicke, but for his
gratefull Hymnes composed
and sung to Gods

praise vpon euery fresh
occasion; and hee calles
vpon Princes and Rulers
three times in one verse,
because they haue three
times the cause that Subiects
haue, who haue but a
single share in those blessings,
which ioyntly meet
in the head of Soueraigntie.
Hee often puts the
thorne to his Breast, as if
he found some obliuion
there, or vnwillingnesse:
Aug. in Psal. 145. quasi tacentes inuenerit Angelos hortatur qui tamen nun-quam tacuerunt. yea, he often calls
vpon the Angell, eyther

implying the worth of the
worke, or else that the
best alacritie may admit
excitation.Aentas Syluius, lib. 4. de dictis Alphonsi. 
               Alphonsus,
that renowned King, in
a speech to the Popes
Embassadour, professeth
he did not so much wonder
at his Courtiers ingratitude
to him, who had
raysed sundry of them
from meane to great Estates,
as at his owne to
God. How acceptable an
offering shall this bee to

God, if it may kindle
the least sparke, or rather
blow those coales already
flaming in your
royall Breast, or testifie
our gratefulnesse to him
for his infinite, old and
new fauours to your Maiesties
Person, and
thereby in your Kingdomes.
For all defects
in it, the Title pleades
Pardon, and Acceptance:
Euen GOD
himselfe allowed a Female

in Peace-Offerings,
not admitted in other
kindes. Gratitude
hath set a price vpon
meane Presents. The
forme of a Sermon will
not disparage the subiect
matter. The best Monuments
of Constantines
Gouernment, is a
gratefull Sermon, recorded
at large by Eusebius
in his tenth, whose
blessed, and much honoured
dayes, God make

yours equall and exceed
in length and happinesse.
So humbly and heartily
prayes
            
               Your Maiesties most
loyall and thankfull
Subiect.

               In all things giue thankes, for this is
the will of God in Christ Iesus our
Lord towards you.
            
            
               MAy an Herauld find
out a rich Coat of
Armes vngiuen,

subiect vnhandled.Virtutum laudatissima &c. Sen.
               
               Gratitude, a vertue whose

beautie so equally blazeth in the
eyes of all, whose name sounds so
pleasantly in the eares of all,
whose contrary is so odiously censured
of all,
                  Basil entitleth an Homily of giuing thanks, but the subiect matter is of bearing afflictions cheerefully. to whom hath it been
beholding for so much as a small
Tract or Sermon? What Diuine
hath bestowed so much cost vpon
it, as to acquaint vs with the Nature,
Kindes, Canons, and Motiues
of it? Men I confesse, had
the vse of Logicke before the Art
was penned; and so Dauid the
King of all gratefull persons with
other the seruants of God in all
ages haue in abundant measure expressed
their thankfulnesse; yet
no man will denie, but that rules,
and directions orderly collected,
and compiled, doe much conduce
to a more liuely and certaine practise,
then wilde and vnguided
affections; and such helpes Gods
Spirit in ordinary despiseth not.
            
               
All that I shall vpon this sudden
and extraordinary cause of publique
thankes vndertake, is to bee
as the Wheele to the Bird, which
with its course noyse setts better
Musicke on worke; and out of this
short Text of Gratitude, indeuour
to bring some light to the dutie
enioyned, Giue thankes.
            
            Secondly, to shew the extent of
it's matter, In all things.
            
            3. To inforce the practise frō this
motiue of motiues, For this is the
will of God in Christ Iesus our Lord.
            
            Fourthly, to bring it home, and
apply it, Towards you.
            
            In handling whereof, if I shall
procure any whit the more tribute
of thankes and praise to God, I
shall attaine that which is the
Queene of all causes, the end of
my labour; yea, that which is the
Queene of all ends, Gods glory.
            
               Giue thankes. The nature and

grace of thankfulnesse consists in
a kindly reflexion of Honour vpon
the Benefactor for the benefit receiued.
Looke what perfection a
solid Body giues to the Sunne
beames, which hauing obscurely
passed thorowe the translucent
Ayre, are by it made to rebound
with a spreading increase of their
lustre and heate. Looke what such
an Eccho as the seuen fold porch
of Thebes is to the sound of a
Trumpet, such is Thankefulnesse
to the Benefactor. And therefore
in reference to Parents is the
summe of pietie; to Equals, of amitie
and humanitie; to God, of
Religion: yea, the very prime and
summe of all Vertues and Duties,
because it most directly and fully
promotes & atchieues that which
is the ende and scope of all the
Creators workes and gifts,Psal. 50. 
               His
glorie: Hee that praiseth mee, honoureth

mee: and contrariwise,Rom. 1. 
               they
glorified not God, neither were thankfull.
            
            To discusse here these Schoole-Quaeries,
               Vide Thomae secunda secundae quaestione centesima sexia.
whether it bee a part of
commutatiue or distributiue Iustice,
whether a generall vertue or
speciall, distinct or confounded
with Pietie and Iustice: whether
voluntary or bounden; whether of
debt and by Law, or meere honestie;
whether the innocent or the
penitent be more obliged; whether
it may ad-equate or surpasse the
benefite, were to trouble your
heades with frigid subtilties, in
stead of warming your hearts with
profitable matter. A thankefull
man had rather by tenne times
learne how to discharge this bond
of needfull dutie, then to vntye
these knots of curious wit.
            To such a one I content my
selfe to giue the olde Tripartite

rule,Corde, or

lib. 2. cap. 23. let him see that his Soule, his
Tongue, and his Life beare their
parts,Conscientia, lingua, vita. Aug. in Psal. 148. discharge their seuerall offices
in glorifying God, that so his
thankes being Cordiall, Orall, and
Reall, they may bee compleat and
accepted of God. And first let
them make sure of the first, especially
when hee hath to doe with
God, the Maker, Searcher, and
Iudge of the Spirits, who in these
kindes of Offerings loues the fat,Leuit. 3.
and the inwards: the deeper and
hollower the belly of the Lute or
Violl is, the pleasanter is the
sound; the fleeter, the more grating
and harsh in our eares:By how much spring water is better then plash water, by so much handy hearty, then wordy thanks. the
voyce which is made in the mouth
is nothing so sweet as that which
comes from the depth of the
breast. Sing with grace in your
hearts is the best tune to all the
Psalmes, without which if one
could descant with the voyce of

an Angell, hee were but as the
sound of a tinckling Cymball.
The very Alpha and Omega, the
principall and totall of our thanks
with God, is as Bernard ends his
Epistles and Counsels to one that
enquired of him what God required
of man, Giue mee thy heart, or
keepe all to thy selfe. If Beniamin
come not, all the rest may stay behind.
Vnlesse therfore thou meane
to offer the sacrifice of fooles,Tota estimatio ad animuns redit. Sen.
                and
the lippes of calues, begin and end
as Dauid his Psalmes,Psalm. 103. 
               My soule
praise thou the Lord. Take also Dauids
Commentary, And all that is
within mee praise his holy name. The
first worke is of the vnderstanding
to iudge of the worth of the benefite,
to consider the vnworthinesse
of the receiuer, to studie a
Quid retribuam. A foole cannot,
and a proud man wil not be thankfull;
the first, because hee cannot

estimate and weigh in the ballance
of Iudgement, the value of the fauour
conferred vpon him, or
through melancholly conceitednesse
will not see what God hath
done for them. The second because
hee conceiues it no more, if
not lesse then his due and desert,
which is the reason that an Heretique
ouerweening the strength of
his naturalls, or the merit of his
works, cannot be thankfull; which
taught Prosper wittily and wisely
to entitle his Poems Contra ingratos,
without further naming the
aduersaries of Gods grace. A rash
man cannot bee thankfull, who for
a fit onely and brunt, sends vp an
extemporary God bee thanked,
whereas he ought fixedly, and seriously
to studie and deuise how
hee might cast most honour vpon
his good God for his bountie to
him.
            
               
The second care must be had of
the Memory, that a deepe impression
bee made, frequent refreshing
and refrication bee vsed with Dauids
watchword, My soule, forget
not all his benefits; which made him
write downe his passions, and giue
his Psalmes the title of Record, or
Remembrance. Obliuion is so farre
from excusing, that it selfe is the
worst kinde of Ingratitude, excluding
all hopes of future thankes,
and arguing a slight esteeme of fauours
past, which so soone haue
set them behind backe, and out of
sight, in some blind corner of the
mind. Our Memory is a naturall
mother to iniuries, a stepmother
to benefits, for the helpe whereof
our gratefull forefathers were
wont to erect Pillars and Monuments,
stampe Coines, giue names
to Places, dedicate Dayes, and
keepe anniuersary Feastes, that so

they might preserue a Vestall fire
in their breasts, and not serue God
with a flash of ioy and blaze of
thankes. A third worke is the
warmth of the affections, which
if dead and cold, how can any
fumes of Incense ascend? Excesse
of ioy and gladnesse is in stead of
thanks, which the neerer it comes
to a rapture and extasie (such an
one as Peter was in, when he wot
not what hee said; or the Iewes
comming out of captiuitie, faring
as one in a dreame) the more pleasing
it is vnto God, though it expresse
it selfe in abrupt and exorbitant
passions and gestures, such as
Dauids dauncing vnseemely in
foolish Micholls, but most comely
and kingly in Gods eies.
            These actes of the soule are often
all that God requires, but alwaies
the best fountaine and spring
of thankes, which sets the price

vpon the Offring; and makes the
Turtle of the poore as welcome
as the Oxe of the rich, the Cruse
and Mite of the Widdow more
worth then the Riuers of Oyle
and treasures of the wicked.
            All this is but intrinsicall and
immanent thankes; but Gods fauours
are too great for one mans
heart to comprehend or requite:
and therefore hee will not haue
them die in the breast of one man,
and lye buried in silent admiration,
but requires a transitiue expression
and publication of them.
How many aydes and witnesses
doth Dauid summon to assist him
in this worke, the Mountaines to
leape, the Flouds to make a noise,
the Hils to clap ther hands: and
which of his musicall Instruments
doth hee not call vpon? Sundry
helpes and signes of thankefulnesse
hath Nature and Art found out

and vsed; ringing of bells, displaying
of banners, pompe and feasting,
lights and fires, which while
some condemne, they come neere
his fault that asked, What meaneth
this wast? yet are all these but a
poore and sencelesse kinde of sacrifice
performed by reasonlesse Deputies,
if the thankes determine
and end in these without more significant
expression. Cheere of
the countenance, gestures of the
body, leaping and dauncing are
but dumbe shewes, the best Interpretour
of the minde is the
tongue, the glory of man, and
glorifier of God. My tongue shall
tell of thy wondrous actes▪ and my
lips shall neuer cease to publish thy
praise. This was all the fee Christ
expected for his cures, Goe and tell
what God hath done for thee: words
seeme to bee a poore and sleight
recompence. But Christ (saith

               Nazianzene) call'd himselfe the
Word, and good words comming
from a good heart are of great accompt
and force with God and
man.
            
               Dauid enuied the Birdes that
might in their kinds sing Gods
praise in his Courts, and in imitation
of them, who set themselues
on the highest tops of Trees
whence their notes may bee furthest
heard, he laboured to spread
Gods prayses in the greatest Congregations
in Sauls Court, in all
Companies hee came in, in the
Temple it selfe. By speech one
mans heart conueies into another
the cheerely conceptions and passions
of his soule, and so multiplies
praise, and sets others on
worke to blesse God wit him, &
the more the merrier, & the more
mirth the more thankes; the greater
the flocke, the cheerelier noise;

the fuller the Quire, the lowder
the Musicke, and one cheerely
Bird often sets all the flock a chirping;
one man showts, and the
whole Hoste followes. Iohn heard
a voyce from the Throne, saying,
Praise yee our God, all his Seruants
small and great; and immediatly
a noyse as of many waters,
and mightie Thunderings, saying,
Hallelu-iah, for the Almightie
reigneth.
            Yet because speech is transient,
and of life for the present onely,
the Pennes and writings of thankfull
men haue beene of singular
vse to transmit and conuey vnto
Posteritie the noble Acts of God:
one generation teaching another
to keepe like praises in store, that
Gods thankes may bee immortall
in Succession, and Propagation.
Such fruite may our Statute haue
in after ages, penned for the perpetuation

of Gods inualuable deliuerance
from that Hellish-Powder-plott,
were it as duely read as
it was prouidently enacted.
            When we haue giuen God good
words,Gregorius moralium vltimo, e 12. it remaines that wee giue
him not words alone,Per victimas caro aliena, per obedientiam propria voluntas mactatur. but our reall
obedience, preferred by God
to all our sacrifices: slay not our
beasts, but our beastly lusts; giue
him not our goods, but our selues;
not any dead, but a liuing and
reasonable sacrifice. Hee that in
way of thankefulnesse vowes and
performes the mortification of
one dareling sinne, the addition of
one good dutie, pleaseth God better
then Salomon with his twentie
thousand Beeues and Sheepe.
Would wee know then how wee
should perfect our thankes, walke
wee with God, let vs doe righteousnesse,
abound in Almes and
Prayer; better our Pietie and

Charitie, increase the workes of
our callings, bring foorth more
fruit in our kindes: for with such
sacrifices God is most honoured
and best pleased. The Auncient
and wonted thankes after victories
& blessings, were reformation of
vices, remouall of Idols, sanctions
and executions of good Lawes,
release of debts, bounty to the
poore. The life of thankefulnesse
consists in the liues of the thankefull;Non sola vox sonet, sed & manus consonet, verbis facta concordent, quando cantas Halleluiah manum porrigas esurienti. Aug in Psal. 149
otherwise it is but as one
should sing a good song with his
Voyce, and play a bad one on his
Instrumēt, which would make but
a blacke Sanctis, and become such
Saints. He that saith, God be thanked
with his mouth, and in his life
remaines reprobate to euery good
worke, hath the shew of thankes,
but the power of ingratitude, and
is neere the curse of the Fig-tree,
full of leaues, aud emptie of fruit;

for God is not mocked with words.
Wherefore, O thou vaine man,
iustifie thy wordes by thy workes,
and thou shalt bee blessed in thy
deedes, and God, by the poore,
blessed for them, who hath himselfe
no neede or profit of our
workes: but as great men turnes
ouer his fees and thankes to his
poore Followers & Seruants, and
els vs in plaine termes, he reckons
that done to himself which is done
to the least of his; & smels as sweet
a sauor of Cornelius his almes, as of
his prayers, and counts himselfe as
much honoured by a good housekeekeeper
as by a Church-frequenter:
but best by him that is
both in truth, and from faith. A
Canticum 
nou
                     ••
                   & vetus homo male concordāt, cantet canticum nouum, qui noua est creatu a qui nouam praestat obedientiā. Aug. in Psal. 149. cui lingua tua laudes Dei cantillat cuius vita sacrilegium exhalat. Idem in Psa. 23. new Song becomes not the olde
mans mouth, & let him sing a new
song that leads a new life, and thats
the best harmony and makes the
best Musicke in Gods eare.
            
               
               In all things. Now I haue shewed
how thou mayest and must bee
thankefull; if thou aske me wherein,
or for what, I will aske thee,
what thou hast of thine owne, and
what of right and desert? If nothing,
then In all things giue thanks.
Wee haue heard that a thankefull
man needes a good iudgement:
but wee shall see that he needs no
inuention, if his heart bee in tune,
all things will bring matter to
hand. Gratitude, is as large as
Logicke, that hath for his obiect
things that are, and that are not.
There bee fauours Priuatiue, and
fauours Positiue; there bee good
things bestowed, and euils kept
from vs; yea, the very euils that
doe betide vs are turned to our
good, and therefore we are bound
to giue thankes in all, and for All.
Not with a Collectiue thankes by
lumpe and whole sale, with a God

bee thanked for all his benefits, but
distrioutiuely keeping a Bill of the
particulars, and duely thanking as
we dayly receiue them. This distribution
is best made by a iust
gradation and Scale of discretion,
ascending in our thankes according
to the degrees of his fauours.
            First, hee will bee praised in all
his creatures, whereof wee haue
the sight or the vse, euen as if we
had a proprietie in them: for euery
one of vs haue no lesse benefit
by the Sunne and Ayre, then if we
sawe and breathed alone. The
Hebrewes haue a Canon, that God
would be praised in the least Emmet
or Gnat, but magnified in the
Elephant and Leuiathan; admired
in the Sunne, Moone, Starres, Comets,
Earthquakes, Thunders, and
such extraordinary workes: the
praise of his wisedome and power

lyes asleepe,Ra
                     •
                  mundus
 in Theologia naturali. and dead in euery
Creature, till man actuate and enliues
it. The Heauens and the
Earth, and all things therein are
sayd to praise God; that is, (sayth
Augustine) when thou considerest
their order and beautie,August in Psal. 48. tua voce clamat, &c. and
praisest the inuisible Creator, they
praise him with thy vnderstanding
and thy voyce, which haue
none of their owne, but are dumbe
and sencelesse.
            
               In all the workes of his prouident
administration: and here let
publique blessings haue the precedency
in thy thankes. It's not onely
selfe-loue, but want of Iudgement
that makes fooles prize a domesticall
and priuate welfare before
the Commonwealth, and the
good of the Kingdome, which is
in it selfe the greater, and would
in the long runne be greater to the
particular man. Is any cost bestowed

on the priuate cabbin, comparable
to the sauing of the whole
Ship? The very Heathens reioyced
more in their countries good,
then in their owne. Let Christians
much more praise God for their
Kings, Princes, and Rulers, by
whose wise gouernment they may
liue a quiet life vnder their Vines
and Figtrees, and in all honesty and
godlinesse worship God in their
Chappels and Churches.
            
               In all thy personall fauours: among
which the priuatiue challenge
a place; that is, such euils as
passe by ouer thee. Famous is
the Story of the good Bishop, that
seeing a Toad by the way, lift vp
his heart vnto God, that made
him not such a creature. And Chrysostome
wills vs to walke into Hospitalls
and Lazar-houses,Chrysost. ad Stagerium. Epist. 3. that by
the sight of others miseries, wee
may bee occasioned to thanks for

our owne freedome. Euery man
that seees another stricken, and
himselfe spared, is to keepe a Passeouer
for himselfe.
            
               In all the crosses that doe befall
vs; yea, happily more then in them
we count and call blessings; to call
for afflictions wee haue no President,
or Precept in Scripture; but
to praise God for them, store of
both: To count it exceeding ioy,
because of the exceeding gaine; to
count it an honour that wee are
counted worthy to suffer, as the
Disciples that leaped and sung after
their scourgings; and in this
theme Basil spends all his Sermon,
which he entitles giuing of thanks
in all things.
            
               In all the gifts of God, whether
for necessitie or pleasure, of Nature
or of Grace, temporall or
eternall, more for necessities,
then for delicacies, more for thy

bread and water then for thy wine
and oyle, for thy clothes then for
thy lace and ornaments▪ for thy
health more then thy wealth, for
thy good name aboue thy Iewels,
the goods of thy soule aboue all
goods. Plato obserued this order
in this thankes, that hee was a man,
a Grecian, an Athenian, and Socrates
his Scholler. Alphonsus▪
               
that he was a King, a Philosopher,
and a Christian: Theodosius, more
that hee was a member of Christ
in his Church, then head of the
Empire: Paul best of all, Blessed
be God that hath blessed vs with spirituall
blessings in heauenly things.
One spiritual is better then all corporall,
and one eternall then all
temporall.
            
               In all thy spirituall blessings,
preparations, preuentions, excitations,
motions, actes, confirmations,
consummations, giue all to the

praise of his grace by which thou
art that thou art; chiefly in those
thou hast most wanted, and earnestly
begged, in these let thy praises
answere thy prayers. Samuel
and Augustine, children of many
prayers and feares, were also children
of many praises and thanks.
            
               In all and aboue all, for him that
is All in all, thankes and praises.
For he is worthy who hath redeemed
vs, and made vs Kings and
Priestes vnto himselfe: and if
thanks be the will of God in Iesus
Christ towards vs, then sure I am
it is his will, that all thankes bee
giuen him for Iesus Christ, in
whom all the promises are Yea,
and Amen.
            
               In all things, in all times, and in
all places; so the very Context
implies; pray alwaies, in all things
giue thanks. Wish with Epictetus,
thou wert of the Nightingales vnwearied

spirit, euer to bee singing
day and night, at least with Bernard
imitate the other Birds, which
morning and euening, at the rise
and setting of the Sunne omit not
to praise their Creator. These
must bee constant, set, and inuiolable
times. Occasionall times are
when benefits are newly receiued,
which otherwise soone waxe stale,
and putrifie as Fish: no part of the
Thankes-offering might bee kept
vnspent till the third day. Hezekiah
wrote his Song the third day after
his recouery: The liuing shall praise
thee as I doe this day. And if hee
had been as speedy in his thankes
after his deliuerance from Ashur,
It may bee (sayeth Lauater) his
Plate had neuer been carryed into
Babylon. All dayes of prosperitie
& mirth are seasonable for thanks,
as Birds sing more in cleare dayes
then in gloomy. Let him that is

sad, pray; and hee that is merrie,Isodor. in Leuit. Theodoret.
giue thanks. The Iewes three solemne
Feastes were to bee kept in
three cheerefull sensons▪ he Passeouer,
at the first riping of corne;
Whitsontide, at the first reaping;
Tabernacles, at the ende of Haruest.
God loues a cheerfull giuer.
Christ willed his Passion should
bee remembred when our spirits
are refreshed with bread and wine.
I will take the cup of Saluation, &c.
Our ioy which otherwise is a slippery
passion, is then safe and fanctified,
when it brings forth thanksgiuing.
            Were it hot now superfluous to
say, to whom this thankes ought
to bee giuen? To whom but to
him of whom we haue all things?
Yet wee had rather change the
name, and shift the debt to any
saue the right Creditor, ascribing
euents to Nature, Destiny, and

Fortune,Vide Senec. lib. 3. rather then to the liuing
God; which is as if one should say,
he ought no money to Seneca, but
to Lucius Annius, which are but
blinde names of the same man.
What is more common thē to rob
God to pay the Instrument? The
Fisher sacrificeth to his Net, the
Husbandman will thank his dunghill
for his crop, rather then him
that giues the increase. God allowes
some praise to the Instrument.
The sword of God, and the
sword of Gideon: but when hee
heares vs giue more to the meanes
then to the Author, hee is iealous,
and offended more iustly then Saul
with the people for singing of Dauids
ten thousand, and Sauls thousand.Gant. 3.
Let Saloman haue his thousand,
and the keeper of the Vine
two hundred. Adrian and Verus,
Emperors of old, Selimus and Ferdinand
of late are taxed in History

for erecting monuments of victory
to their horses, forgetting the Lord
of Hostes. Let vs learne of Paul in
right downe termes in all things
to blesse the Father of our Lord
Iesus Christ.
            Thus all things inuite vs to
thanks; and yet Paul foreseeing our
backwardnesse and excuses, opposeth
to them all the will of God in
Iesus Christ: For this is the will of
God. The vngratefull like vnto the
sluggard, is wittie in finding out
pretexts and pretences, making a
clogge to hinder, of that which
should bee his goad to quicken
him. Gods name he will tell you,
excels all thankesgiuing, his blessings
are innumerable, and why
should he attempt impossibilities?
and yet the same man in seeking
of wealth and honour, will shoot
at the fayrest mark, though he take
vp his arrow short. Heere vnlesse

hee may doe all, hee will doe nothing
at all: but Gods will is thou
shouldest doe thy good will, and
hee will accept thy will for the
deed.Nec deterior si vituperatur, nec malior si laudatur. Bernard. And if thou shouldest say in
thy heart, What addition shall my
praise make to his honour, that is
infinite and selfe-sufficient? was
he not as happy before there was a
man or Angell to praise him, as
since? I might answere with a
Schooleman,Raymundus de naturali Theolog. hee counts it an increase
ad extra, in the notice and
glory of his attributes, though ad
intra, in the perfection and excellency
of them he cannot increase.
But I had rather answere with our
Apostle, It is his will. But we haue
need of his benefits; if hee will allow
vs the profit, we may well allow
him the praise; our emptinesse
cals for the one, and to his fulnesse
belongs the other. Bradwardine as
thankfull an English heart as euer

wrote, knits and vntyes the knot
thus, Why should I goe about to
pay that debt which is vnpayable,
and by paying whereof I runne
further in debt; for the grace and
heart, the will and abilitie to bee
thankfull is his gift, and for that
I must bee further obliged, as Dauid
when hee built the Temple.
But GOD forbid, sayeth hee, that
I should intangle mine heart in this
chaine of Ingratitude, and breake
asunder this my bond of thankes,
because I cannot vnloose it: let
mee rather knowe this to bee my
happinesse, to whom I owe much,
to owe more; to bee as deepe in

               For this is Gods will in Iesus
Christ. Gods will hath binding
authoritie enough, but hee addes
a winning word, his will in Christ,
commending the dutie to vs from
God by that louely Name. The
force of the perswasion is, as if
God should say to vs, Behold, I
haue so loued you, as to giue you
my Sonne, and with him all
things; and what returne doe I
expect? what is my will, but that
in all things you giue mee thankes
in his Name. Thanks is my will,
and pleaseth my will, as sweet odours
doe mans nostrills. Gratitude
needes not, as other Vertues,
Letters testimoniall, or commendatory.
Dauid often telles vs, it's

                Prayer is profitable, but
praise is honourable: to Aske is a
troublesome thing, and a mendicant
word implying want, and
therefore comes hardly and harshly
from vs; but praise becomes
the Angels, yea the Sonne of God,
and therefore should be welcome
to vs. It is a grace and praise to
him that giues, as well as to him to
whom it is giuen. How renowned
in all Story hath been the practise
of this vertue in Dauid to Ionathans,
Abimelechs, and Barzilla's
posteritie; in Ioseph to his parents;
in Hannah (more honoured for being
the Authour of a Song, then
the mother of a sonne) in Cromwels

hatefull in Iudas, Achitophel, Pharaohs

finable by any legall or set mulct,
as sufficiently censurable, but deseruing,
and left to excesse of hatred
by Gods Iudgement, and so
generally reputed of al, the summe
of all disgrace; the worst, yea all
that can bee said of a man; say this
and say all; the maine sinne of the
apostate Angels, and damned Spirits.
Thanks the chiefe,Sit illud meditatio frequens in hoc saeculo quod epus erit in futuro. Aug. Psa. 148. if not the
whole worke of the glorified Seraphims,
who vent and spend all
their burning fire in the flames of
GODS praise. How cheerefully
should wee redeeme time to this
blessed worke? which because it
is too large to be done in this spanlong
life, it shall euer bee doing in
that eternitie. What like euidence
hath a Saint of GODS free and
princely Spirit residing in his heart

and tongue to this Frankincense,
and free worke, wherein our ingenuitie
is best tryed, not extorted
from vs by our owne necessities, as
prayer, nor exacted by Lawe, or
drawne by shame or penaltie from
vs, but voluntary, and therefore
best testifying vs to bee of Gods
willing people: which grace,
where he giues, surely he will confer
more of all kindes. For where
doe men delight to sowe, but in
fertile soyles, where they reape
most? Where doe Musitions delight
to sound their Instruments,
but where the Eccho multiplies
thē most in their returne? But our
profit is too sordid a motiue for
this liberall vertue. Thanks is not
thanks, if bribing and eying future
fauour, if any thing more then
the praise of past bountie, though
there should neuer bee need or receipt
of any more afterwards.

But our dulnesse hath need of all
spurres. Dauid the Nightingale
of Israel sets many a thorne to his
breast, that vigilant cocke clappeth
oft his owne wings. An ingenuous
childe desires no more but
to know what his father loues. Isaak,
if his dyet bee knowen, shall
bee sure of Venison enough: and
if Saul take delight in Dauids
Harpe, he shall not want Musicke.
A grateful Courtier desires but to
know what the will and pleasure
of his Soueraigne is: and this is
enough, and aboue all other bonds
to a man sensible of the benefits of
Creation and Redemption. What
else is the difference and preheminence
of the Gospell aboue the
Lawe, but Thankes the one, and
Debt the other? Which made Vrsinus
iudiciously giue his Booke of
Obedience and Good workes the
title of Gratitude: which who so

sleights or neglects, vndoes and
dissolues the whole bond of perfection,
not of Humanitie alone,
but of all Christianitie. God abhorring
all that wee can doe with
other respect or end, bidding the
proud man and his merits perish,
done in way of desert or pay, onely
accepting that which is done in
the name of Christ, in way of
thankfulnesse for him and his merit,
who is the Altar which sanctifies
and graceth the gold and the
gift to the hornes whereof it is
best binding with the cordes of
thankes all our offerings: who is
the great Master of Requests, hauing
a golden Viall ready to offer
vp, and commend to his Father all
the Incense of his Saints, and to
giue a sweete odour and perfume
vnto them, making the least Cup
of water tendered in his name of
precious account, without which

all is abominable: And therefore
hee that would set a speciall glosse
vpon his sacrifice of thankes, let
him with the acknowledgement
of his vilenesse (as Dauid, Who am
I and my people?) craue acceptance
in his name, in whom God is well
pleased: for this is his will in Christ
Iesus our Lord, &c.
            
            That Thankes in Thesi and generall
is Gods will, it is now out of
question: but there is yet another
clause in my Text, Towards you,
which bidds vs search, what is
Gods will in Hypothesi, in particular.
Towards vs: euen to vswards
of this Nation, this Assembly, towards
thee and mee, all and euery
one of vs ioyntly and seuerally.
First, it is requisite that wee take
good notice of our Receipts, and
then balance them well with our
Returnes; and so shall wee see our
Arrerages best, and what remaines

for vs to doe. Marke we aduisedly
what our owne Writers, Historians,
Poets vsually applaud in our
Nation; how they extoll our Climate,
our Soyle, our natiue Commodities,
our Policies, Lawes, Orders,
Peace, Plentie, Prosperitie,
terming vs Albion, quasi Olbion; Angli,
quasi Angeli. Can too much in
truth bee spoken to the praise of
Gods bountie, and blot of our Ingratitude?
How hath he lifted vs
vp to Heauen, seuered this Iland
with the seas of his mercies from
all the world besides, and bordering
kingdomes round about, setting
it as a Queene in the middest
of them, to heare newes of warres,
pestilence, bloodshed, and desolations,
not to feele the least disturbance
from within or without,
scarce to heare a dog barke against
it's long cōtinued peace, vnmatchable
in present or past examples.

Aboue all, what a golden Candlestick
hath he placed in it, furnished
with oyle and lampes, I would I
could say in euery shaft and pipe of
it; but so as I may well resemble it
to a bright skie in a cleare euening
sparkling with Starres, though not
in euery part, yet in euery Zone and
quarter of it. What times can tell
of the like light, learning, preaching,
knowledge? Oh that I could
say practise and thankfulnesse answerable.
What an hedge or wall
of fire and protection hath God
made about vs? what glorious saluations
from forreigne inuasions,1588.
from domesticall treasons,1605. such as
wilscarse be credible to after ages.Factum est hoe à Domino mirifico in consilijs, magnifico in operibus, & est mirabile in oculis nostris.
Was Israel it selfe euer honoured
with more? To all these, when for
a while of late we were in a damp
of griefe & feare in the absence of
our Prince for a season, how suddenly
hath hee blowne ouer that

cloud? how speedily and happily
hath he returned him, that we fare
as people in a dreame, can scarse
tell how to beleeue our selues, or
how to expresse our ioyes enough;
how hath he filled our hearts with
gladnesse! Oh that I may bee able
truly to say, our tongus with praise,
and our liues with duties. In this
fresh & last fauour of his, he deales
mee thinkes with vs as Creditors
with slow Debtors, where they
haue aduentured much, they will
sometimes shoot another arrow in
hope to finde and make good their
former losses; as Seneca counsells
his Ebutius to imitate the husbandman,
who neuer leaues husbanding
and manuring the barren ground,
till he make it fertil, to heape benefit
on benefit, till hee awaken his
vnthankfull friend, ouercome him
with kindnesse, and in the end by
some welcome good turne excite

his dulnesse, and extort thankes by
that for all the former from him.
I would I were as sure God should
speed of his end, as I am sure this is
his end, to put vs to the blush for
our former ingratitude, to winne
vs at length to pay our debts and
vowes vnto him. Some, and sundry
of all sorts great and meane he
hath, I doubt not, among vs, gratefull
obseruers and receiuers of his
blessings. like a few berries after
the shaking of a tree, which makes
him forbeare to lay the Axe to the
root for a while: but the common
thankes which hee reapes at the
hand of the multitude, is lukewarmnesse
and Newtralitie at the
best; in many lingrings after Superstition
and idolatry; in the worser
sort, desperate swearing, dissolute
sabbath keeping, brutish drunkennes,
and vncleannesse, falshood
in dealings till all burst againe, vanitie

in fashion following, without
shame or modesty. These are the
dregs of our times, & blots of our
feasts, which if not amended, may
not a withdraught of all Gods fauours,
a remoouall of his Candlestick,
the worst of all plagues, be as
certainly foreseen, and foretold, as
if Visions and Letters were sent vs
from heauen, as to the 7. Churches
of Asia? But I hope better things of
our better sort, and loue as little as
may be to haue mine eye & finger
vpon these sores, wishing we might
see such a Book-fire as wee read of
Act. 17. made of all our clandestine
Libels, seditious & male contented
Pamphlets. I speak not against the
pretious balme of reproofe, no not
oyle of Scorpions: let the righteous
smite vs with plain & faithfull
rebukes, and such smitings shal not
woūd the body, or break the head,
but shewe vs our defects without

rancor and malice, powring in no
poyson and venome, but oyle and
wine to heale our wounds, to excite
vs to thankfulnes worthy the
blessings heaped & renewed daily
vpon vs; and what is the best thāks,
but nationall and personal amendment
of life? and what thankes is
enough, what Hecatombs of sacrifices
are sufficient for a God that
hath done so much for vs, and yet
ceaseth not to doe vs good? I
would know of the most ingratefull
man what he can require of vs
more then he hath richly & abundanly
deserued, were it to halfe,
yea to all the wealth of the kingdome?
I take not vpon me to prescribe
particulars. But suppose he
should exact of vs this particular,
which I dare say would highly
please him, and would I am sure
bee a most worthy and needfull
fruit of our gratitude to him. I will

not mention a Ceremoniall, circumstantiall,
superfluous matter of
forme and order, but a necessary
substantiall amendes of what all
confesse to be amisse: a prouision
I mean, of a sufficient maintenance
and Minister in euery Parish of the
Kingdome, a righting of what Popery
hath wronged, a Restitution
of what Religion first consecrated,
Superstition misplaced, couetousnesse
wholly alienated and impropriated.
This could not in likelihood
but prooue a cure of all the
maladies spirituall and temporall,
a dispelling of our Egyptian fogs,
a dispersing of the Frogs that yet
remaine as thornes in our sides, a
quickening to all good workes of
pietie and charity, a goad and spur
to all kinds & fruits of thankfulnes
that God can require of vs. Haue
I spoken of more then he requires,
or we need, or of that which is impossible?

the last will be the onely
plea, but withall the plea onely of
our ingratitude and infidelitie, not
disability. Is it harder now to restore,
then at first to giue? When
God stirred vp his peoples affections,
their Princes and Priests were
faine to set mortmaines & bounds
to their bountie, and stay their
hands from giuing more. What
were a Subsidy or two for God &
his church? If God giue vs hearts,
wood and the sacrifice will soone
be found, & brought to hand; and
till this be done, a iust brand of Ingratitude
lies vpon vs. It's impossible
for any application to extend
to euery particular. If euery Soule
would study thankfulnesse, God
would direct to the best duties. If
euery English man would kindle a
Bone-fire in his owne heart, how
would the flame break out, & shine
abroad, and the smoke ascend vp to

the heauens? If euery thankfull
man would take vp his harpe, and
sing and play with his tongue and
hand a new Song of thankes, how
lowd and full melody would it
make, what ioy would bee on the
earth, yea in the heauens to see our
thankfulnes and amendment. It is
but euery mans labour to sweepe
before his owne doore, and euery
mans Fagot to this fire, and the
worke were done, & God pleased.
Giue vnto the Lord, you Potentates,
glory and strength: giue vnto the
Lord ye sonns of the mighty, worship
and praise due to his Name!
You house of Aaron, and you that
serue him in his Courts, praise yee
the Lord, and stirre vp others to
praise him. Let Israel and all that
feare him say, his mercies endureth

others shall doe, My
soule, praise thou
the Lord.
            
         
         
            
            A Post-script to the
Reader.
            
               A Thankefull man is
worth his weight in
the golde of Ophir.
Could I bee as thankfull as I
ought to be, which, sure I am,
I neuer shall bee, yet can the
thanks of a meane man procure
but meane honour to
God. Could I be as thankfull
as is possible for any one man
to be, yet single thanks is like
a single voyce, which makes
but simple musick. But could
I stirre vp thankfull intentions
& affections in euery Reader,
for example in thy heart,

whose eye is now vpon this
aduise, then wouldest thou also
endeuor to worke the like
in others; and so a small number
by multiplication might
prooue a large summe: as a
great debt is often paid by a
collection from many hands,
which one poore mans abilitie
could neuer haue reached
vnto. That we may be aright
thankfull, it is requisite that
with one eye we obserue our
sinnes and euils both publike
and personall; and with the
other our favours and blessings,
that the one may acquaint
vs with our vnworthinesse;
the other may preuent

male contented vngratefulnesse.
Many a man would
be much more thankfull then
he is, if he had but an hint of
excitation and helpe of direction:
as many a Scholler, if
hee had but a fewe Heads of
Common places, would bee
rich in obseruations, which
for want of such a sleight
helpe vanish in the reading,
and perish in the meditating.
Behold therefore, I giue thee
here a Register or Inventory,
which I wish thee to keepe,
and vse as a Table of thanks
due to God in kind, and negligently
by thee paid. Which
when thou perusest, thou

mayest vnder euery Head in
the space left of purpose, record,
not all and euery fauour,
which is impossible, but the
most memorable, and thankworthy;
putting a speciall Selah
of thankes vpon them, as
Dauid vpon his deliuerance
from the Beare, Lyon, and
Goliah. It cannot but reuiue
thy memory, and quicken thy
affections, so often as thou
shalt seriously reuiew it.

            Quoties tentatio superatur, periculum
declinatur, vitium subiugatur,
annosa & inueterata animi
passio sanatur laqueus deprehenditur,
aut multum cupita

               August in Psal.
            
            Quid est, tota die impleatur
os meum laudibus? Sine
intermissione te laudem, in prosperis
quia consolaris, in aduersis

quia corrigis antequam essem
quia fecisti, quum essem quia
salutem dedisti, quum peccassem
quia ignouisti, &c.
            FINIS.
