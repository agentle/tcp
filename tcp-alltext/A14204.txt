                  LAte in the night, not long agoe
               as I lay in my bed,
               Muſing alone of many things,
               which then came in my hed:
               VVere it by Reuelation,
               by Viſion, or by Dreame:
               Or yet as lying in a traunce,
               or by ſome other meane,
               I knew not well: but yet mee thought,
               as it were ſuddainly,
               One caught me vp into the Aire,
               from whence I did diſcrie
               A Cittie large, of bignes ſuch,
                     the world
                  
               
               as it the World had beene:
               A thouſand thouſand Houſes there,
                     The people, or the bodyes of men.
                  
               
               a man might well haue ſeene:
               Their faſhion, ſtuffe, and workemanſhip,
               
                  in all poynts did excell.
               The order of theſe Houſes too,
               I marked very well:
               Theſe Houſes they were mooueable,
               and often did remooue
               
                  
                     The Soule.
                  To places where the Owners thought
               it fit for their behoue.
               Their ſubſtaunce was of mixed ſtuffe,
               which ſeemed very faire:
               And was deriued from the Fire,
               
               
                  Water, Earth, and Ayre.
               
               
                  
                     The foure Elements.
                  Compacted by ſuch cunning skill,
               as it hath heretofore
               Continued vnconſtant full
               
                  
                     In Adams time.
                  
                  Nine hundred yeeres, and more.
               The cullour of theſe Houſes be
               both faire, ſmoth, and white:
               To ſee them trimly decked vp,
               it would a man delight:
               Yet be as other Houſes be,
               in beautie for a time:
               But when they once do come to yeeres,
               their beautie do decline:
               But euery Houſe doe ſtand alone,
               builded vpright and ſtraight:
               And each was equall in it ſelfe,
               
                  
                     The Armes being ſtretched out▪ the two leggs & thighes.
                  in breadth, in length, in height.
               
               Two Pillars framed like an Arch,
               
               did for foundation ſtand,
               Whereon was builded Tower wiſe,
               each Houſe by cunning hand.
               
                  The Pillars and the Timber-worke,
                  
                     The Bones.
                  
               
               was framed all of Boane,
               As cleere as Alabaſter, and
               as hard as any Stoane.
               No Siluer, Gold, Iron, or Steele,
               no Copper, Tinne, or Braſſe,
               Nor any mettall, VVood or Stone,
               about theſe Buildings was.
               With Laſes very ſtrong and white,
                     The Sinewes
                  
               
               their Ioyntes were tied ſuer:
               And euen ſo long as Houſe did laſt,
               theſe Laſes would endure.
               A Chimney in each Houſe there was,
                     The noctrils.
                  
               
               where out there did proceede
               A vapoure very like to Smoake,
                  
                     The Breath.
                  
               
               and ſometime Smoake indede.
                     Of Tabacco.
                  
               
               They all had Turrets on their tops,
                     Their heads.
                  
               
               and ſome were ſeene to haue
               Vpon their Turrets tops for ſhew,
               a Plume of Fethers braue:
               Theſe Turrets being round: in them
               two Windowes did I ſee,
                     The Eyes.
                  
               
               Which are ſo like to eyes, that I,
               do thinke them eyes to be.
               If any Houſes did decay,
                  
                     Die.
                  
               
               as often times there did:
               Then preſently an other Houſe,
               was raiſed in his ſtead.
                     Borne.
                  
               
               So that the Cittie was ſupplide
               though thouſands did decay:
                     The World.
                  
               
               And ſo ſhalbe ſupplied ſtill,
               
                  vntill the latter day.
               
                  
                     The Scriptures. Diuines.
                  Oft haue I redd in Auncient Bookes,
               
               and Auncient Fathers ſay,
               The matter of theſe Houſes firſt,
               was nothing els but Clay:
               
                  
                     God.
                  Till one did by a wondrous ſkill,
               and Wiſdome, vndertake
               By mixing of the Ellements,
               theſe Houſes all to make:
               
                  
                     God.
                  Not any one (ſaue one alone)
               in all the world can frame
               Theſe Houſes, as theſe Houſes be,
               nor any like the ſame.
               Theſe thinges thus ſeene; thus thought I then,
               If theſe things thus without
               Theſe Houſes, be ſo wonderfull,
               and glorious; then no doubt,
               Thoſe things, the which we cannot ſee,
               which in theſe Houſes are,
               Muſt nedes exceede theſe outward things
               and go beyonde them farre.
               And as I ſtill thus muſing ſtoode,
               euen then it came to paſſe,
               One ſtanding by, did ſpeake to me.
               I know not who it was;
               And bade me looke: I looked then,
               and loe, I did behold
               The Houſes all were open, and
               each did it ſelfe vnfold,
               That I might ſee all thinges in them,
               which was a thing moſt rare,
               
                  To marke how thinges within the ſame,
               in order placed were.
               And firſt, the Kitchen ſeated was,
                     The place frō the Grames to the Midrife.
                  
               
               as nethermoſt of all,
               Whereby it might receiue ſuch things,
               as from aboue did fall:
               By Veſſels, fitting for the ſame,
                     The Bowel▪
                     
                  
               
               which long there, did not ſtay.
               For things that bad, and noyſome were,
               this Kitchen did conuay
               By Gutters, Holes, and Channels ſo,
                     The Yard & the Fundament.
                  
               
               that euery thing was ſeene
               Within this Kitchen for to be
               both hanſome, ſweete, and cleene.
               And yet vnto the Walls thereof,
                     The Sides.
                  
               
               faſt cleauing did I ſee,
               A Matter (like I know not what)
                     The kidnies.
                  
               
               encombred for to bee
               With filthy Grauell, Sand, and Stone,
                  
                     The Collicke and Stone.
                  
               
               which very often was
               A ſtopping to the Cundits, that
               the Water could not paſſe.
                     The Ʋrine.
                  
               
               With that I ſaw an Auncient man,
                  
                     Phiſicke.
                  
               
               that at the gate did ſit:
               To whom the Maker of the houſe,
                  
                     God.
                  
               
               theſe Houſes did commit
               To looke vnto, and them to mende,
               when ought was there amiſſe.
               who then tooke Hawes & ſtamped them
                     A Remedie for the Stone.
                  
               
               and then he put to this,
               
                  White Wine to ſoake; and with the ſame,
               
                  hee afterward did fill
               A Stillitorie, and thereof
               a Water he did ſtill:
               wherewith was waſht this place ſo noyd
               with Grauell and with Sand:
               And preſently the place was cleer'd,
               and clenſed out of hand.
               In ſhape moſt ſtrange and wonderfull,
               
                  
                     The Stomacke.
                  A Pott hunge boyling there:
               Yet vnderneath the ſame was ſeene
               no fyer to appeare.
               
                  
                     The Lyuer.
                  But vnder it a Fountaine was,
               out of the which did flow,
               A lickuor very like to redd
               
               
                  
                     The Blood.
                  or Claret Wine in ſhow:
               VVhich running into euery part
               
               
                  
                     By the Ʋaines.
                  of euery Houſe, did ſerue
               To keepe the Houſe in culler, and
               his beautie to preſerue:
               
                  
                     
                        The oppilation of the Lyuer.
                     
                     
                        The Phiſitian.
                     
                  And if the courſe thereof were ſtopt,
               at any time or tide,
               Then for the ſame, the keeper did
               a remedie prouide.
               And as this Pott hung boyling there,
               it wonder was to ſee,
               The multitude of ſundrie thinges,
               within the ſame to be,
               
                  The ſundry ſorts of meats and drinkes boyling in the Stomacke at once.There fleſh of Fiſhes, Beaſtes, & Fowles
               and many kindes of Graine,
               Fruites, hearbs, & rootes, of diuers ſorts
               within it did remaine:
               
                  And ſundry kinds of white-meates too▪
               
               and Grocerie great ſtore:
               And Water, Wine, & Ale, & Beere,
               and many Liquors more:
               And euery one did differ much,
               in cullour, taſte, and ſmell:
               VVhoſe quallities and vertues, would
               great cunning aske to tell.
               I ſaw it; yet in ſeeing it,
               I tooke no great deliget:
               For why (more ſtrange and wonderfull
               then pleaſant, was the ſight)
               Faſt cleauing to this Fountaines ſide,
                     Fast to the Lyuer cleaueth the Gaull.
                  
               
               there was a little Spring,
               
               VVithin the ſame there ſeemd to be
               a moyſt or liquid thing:
               In cullour like a darkiſh greene,
               and yellowiſh withall:
               The taſte thereof moſt bitter was,
               as it were very Gaull:
               And if this Spring at any time,
               did chaunce to ouerflow,
               It made the Houſe in euery part,
                     The Body.
                  
               
               all yellow for to ſhow,
               As if it were with Saffron dide:
                     The yellow Iaunders.
                  
               
               ſo one did chaunce to bee,
               And then foorthwith a remedie
               the Keeper did foreſee.

                  A Water for to waſh the ſame:
               whereby he did reſtore,
               And made the cullour for to be
               e'uen as it was before.
               All next about this Kitchin lay
               
                  
                     The place from the Midriffe to the necke. The midriffe
                  a large and a faire Hall,
               
               Deuided from the Kitchen with
               a thinne and ſlender wall:
               
               VVhoſe faſhion, ſtuffe, and workmanſhip
               as I was thinking on,
               And did intend to take thereof,
               ſome better view anon:
               Mee thought I heard a voyce, that ſpake,
               and ſayd vnto mee, Looke;
               And what thou ſeeſt; ſee that the ſame
               thou noteſt in the Booke.
               I looked, and within this Hall
               
               were many things to ſee,
               That very rare and precious were,
               and glorious ſeemd to mee.
               
                  
                     The Heart.
                  Amongſt the reſt, one thing I ſaw,
               that did the reſt ſurmount,
               A famous (though a little thing)
               a thing of great account
               It was indeed; and like vnto
               a Throne of Maieſtie:
               Or to a Chaier of eſtate
               it may compared bee:
               In faſhion like a Pine-aple,
               
               
                  
                     The faſhion of the Heart
                  in cullour ſomewhat redd,
               
                  But in the greater end thereof
               a Cannopie was ſprede,
                     The fatues thereof.
                  
               
               That was of cullour very white,
               which ſignifies in deede,
               That he that ſits therein as Iudge,
                     An application of the white & red cullour of the heart.
                  
               
               muſt execute with ſpeede
               True Iustice: yea and Mercie both:
               and that he muſt beware,
               
                  Maliciouſly not to reuenge,
               
               
                  nor parcially to ſpare.
               
               And furthermore there did I ſee
               an hollownes in it,
               And in the ſame a Magiſtrate,
               
               appoynted there to ſit:
                     A good Conſcience.
                  
               
               Who in his office all his time,
               ſo well him ſelfe did beare,
               That all thinges in good order were,
               whilſt he did gouerne there.
               But then (me thought) it greued mee,
               to ſee when he was out,
               
                  A Wretch intrudes himſelfe therein,
                     A badde Conſcience.
                  
               
               who playes ſuch reuell rout,
               That all the good the which before
               the other there had done,
               Was by this wicked wight defaſte
               and vtterly for-done.
               Sometime this Seate ſhould tremble,
                  
                     The trembling of the heart.
                   which
               the Keeper helpe
                     •
                   thus,
               By making a Confection
               
                  De Arramatibus:
                  
                     A remedie for the ſame.
                  
               
               And then applying of the ſame
               
                  vnto the Seate did cauſe,
               The tremblinge and the ſhaking of
               the Seate, forthwith to pauſe,

                  About this roiall Seate was ſeene,
               to hang in open ſight,
               (As Vallance hang about a Bedd)
               a thing in ſubſtance light:
               In collour very changeable,
               and ſoft it was to toutch;
               Yet hard to teare, it was ſo tought
               it doth not differ much
               In faſhion from the Vallance, and
               I thinke it not amiſſe
               To ſhewe the dayly vſe thereof,
               the vſe thereof is this.
               As Bellowes drawes in winde to them,
               and then to blow it out:
               
                  
                     A ſimilitude
                  And ſo doth puffe it to and fro,
               all through a hollow ſpout.

               Hale in the coole and tender aier,
               and then againe it blow,
               And puffe it out euen by a long,

               Thoſe Houſes framed were at firſt,
               and ſo they did endure,
               Till One did by a wicked act,
                     Adam.
                  
               
               then cauſe them for to bee
               Full of ſuch imperfections,

               For many times theſe Houſes all
               haue blemiſhes and blottes,
               Impediments and crookednes,
               deformityes and ſpottes:
               And many imperfections more,
               which often times are done
               By violence or by miſchaunce,
               yea often times they come,
               Through lacke of care of looking to,
               then was it in my minde,
               To helpe theſe inconueniences,
               ſome remedie to finde:
               And as I then did buſie mee,
               therein to take ſome payne,
               One ſuddenly did ſpeake to mee,
               and ſayd, it was in vayne
               To do thoſe thinges, which fitter were,

               by others to be done,
               And bad me goe about the things
               that earſt I had begone,
               With that then looking to the Hall
               
               I did behould and ſee
               A ſhort and hollow Pillar plaſte
                     The Necke.
                  
               
               
                  
                  
                     viz. The top of the Hall.
                  vpon its topp to bee:
               VVhich oftentimes bedecked was
               with Iewels, Pearles, and Ringes▪
               
               With cheines of gold, with pretious ſtones
               and many other thinges.
               The cullour of this Piller was
               as white as any Mylke:
               So was the touching of the ſame,
               as ſoft as any Silke.
               
                  
                     The Ioyntes.
                  It framed was with many Ioynts,
               
               which made it apt to mooue,
               VVhich way the owner of the ſame,
               thinkt fitt for his behooue.
               
                  
                     
                        The Windpipe.
                     
                     
                        The throate gell.
                     
                  
                  Two long and ſlender Cundits do
               within this Piller go,
               By one of them the wind it hath
               his paſſage to and fro:
               A multitude of many thinges,
               do by the other paſſe,
               To fill the Pott which earſt I ſaw,
               
                  
                     The Stomacke.
                  whereas it boyling was.
               Out off this Pipe or Cundit too,
               wee many times may heare
               
                  
                     The Ʋoyce.
                  A very ſweete and ſounding noyſe,
               
               ſo pleaſant and ſo cleare,
               As that it yeeldeth to our care
               a mellodie ſo fit,
               As all the Muſicke in the world,
               is nothing like to it.
               Tpon the vpper end of all
               this hollow Piller, ſtand
               
                  A Turret, ſet in ſuch a ſort,
                     The Head.
                  
               
               and with ſuch cunning hand,
               As to our ſight it ſeemes to grow.
               The workmanſhip of it,
               Doth differ much from all the things,
               which we haue told of yet.
               So doth the forme and faſhion too,
               and ſubſtaunce of the ſame:
               For though that Hee that made it,
                     GOD.
                   in
               ſome roundnes did it frame▪
               
               Yet in the former front thereof,
                     The Face.
                  
               
               ſuch rarenes there is found,
               As nothing in the world can, in
               more maieſtie abound.
               In Beautie from all worldly thinges,
               it beares away the bell:
               In Comelines for to behold,
               all thinges it doth excell.
               And if one well do view the ſame,
                     The maieſty of the Face deſcribed.
                  
               
               ſuch grauitie it beare,
               As that it yeeldeth cauſe of loue,
               and matter eke of feare:
               For meeke, and milde, and gentle thinges,
               feare not to it to come:
               But fierce and cruell thinges from it
               for feare away do rome.
               I ſaw a Dore, which open was,
                     The Mouth.
                  
               
               whereby I might diſcrie
               All thinges which in this Turret were,
               in order as they lie.
               And firſt, I ſaw a Mill therein,
                     The Teeth.
                  
               
               
                  which was deuiſed ſo
               That winde nor water, horſe not hand
               did cauſe it for to goe:
               Nor any Saile did long thereto,
               but yet therein it grindes
               What ſo for man is meete to eate,
               or what therein it findes.
               But yet the thing it grindes withall,
               it is not made of ſtone
               As other Mills but (ſtrange to ſee)
               it framed is of Bone.
               
                  
                     The place where the Braynes lye.
                  All next aboue the Mill there doth
               a little Chamber lie
               Which Chamber ouer head is ſeelde
               with Bone like Iuorie.
               
                  
                     The Skull. The Braine.
                  In it a Bed (in Pallet wiſe)
               doth lie vpon the floore,
               Be wrapped in a Sheete of Lawne:
               
                  
                     
                        The thin web which wrappeth in the Brayne. The Forehead.
                     
                     
                        Inuention.
                     
                  and in this Bedd before,
               Or in the former part thereof,
               doth ſit a gallant wight,
               Luſtie and young Inuention,
               
               for ſo his name it hight.
               But in the hinder part of it,
               
                  
                     Memory.
                  an Auncient man doth lie,
               Who many thinges doth beare in minde,
               they call him Memorie.
               
               Betwixt theſe two, out of this Bedd,
               
               I ſaw there did ariſe
               
                  
                     Wit.
                  A proper fleete and ſlender Youth:
               It is his common guiſe,
               
                  Much company for to frequent,
               and in his table talke,
               To argue there of many thinges,
               to make his Clapper walke.
                     The Tongue
                  
               
               Hee often times with Learned men
               will offer to diſpute,
                     The property of a yong and greene wit.
                  
               
               And if that they his arguments
               at any time confute,
               Then will he wrangle mightely,
               and then a man ſhall heare
               Both quips and taunts, yea rayling words
               hee ſcarcely can forbeare:
               Hee thinketh to be furniſhed
               ſufficiently with skill,
               Did take in hand to guide the Houſe,
               
               the Clapper, and the Mill,
               
               For in this Mill a Clapper was,
                     The tongue.
                  
               
               (tis wonder for to tell)
               What thing this Clapper can performe
               if Miller vſe it well:
                     Wit.
                  
               
               But if that he be negligent
               in ordering of the ſame,
               The Millar then and all the Houſe
               
               it bringeth out of frame.
               I ſawe my ſelfe when many folke
               vnto this Millar came,
               Who hauing no regard vnto
               His Clapper how it ran:
                     Tongue.
                  
               
               Vpon a little conference,
               betwixt them there did raiſe
               Some wrangling words: words breeding brawles,
               
                  
                  
                     The inconuenience that grow by miſgouerning of the tongue.
                  and then did follow Frayes:
               And ſo of Frayes came bloody Wounds
               of Wounds did Slaughter ſpring:
               Then Griefe and Shame enſu'd thereof:
               thus did the Clapper bring
               All out of frame, and order too,
               when vnaduiſedly,
               The Miller did permit the ſame,
               at large to runne awry.
               Now that this Houſe ſome light might haue
               things farr and neare to ſpie,
               
                  
                     The Eyes.
                  Two little Lights glaſwindow-wiſe,
               were on this Turret hie.
               
                  
                     The eye-lids
                  Two Caſements did to each belong,
               to ope or ſhut withall,
               VVhen to the Windowes any harme,
               were likely for to fall:
               And each of them a Pentice hath,
               
                  
                     The Eye-browes.
                  which ouer it depend,
               From duſt, and raine, and other harmes,
               thoſe Windowes to defend.
               All next aboue thoſe Pentices,
               
               
                  
                     The Brow or Forehead.
                  there is an open place,
               
               In faſhion like a Table, and
               not much vnlike the ſpace
               That's painted White vpon a wall:
               wherein doth vſe to ſtand
               
                  
                     A 
                           〈◊〉
                        .
                  A Diall drawne with certaine lynes,
               there made with skilfull hand:
               By which the howers and the courſe
               of euery day we know,
               
                  And eke the moouings of the Sunne,
               theſe dayly to vs ſhew.
               Euen ſo vpon this Former front,
                  
                     Viz. The Brow.
                  
               
               in open vewe there lies
               A ſort of Long and ſlender lines,
                  
                     The lines on the forehead.
                  
               
               Whereof ſome do deuiſe
               An Arte, cald Phiſiognomie;
                     A degreſsion to the Art of Phiſognomie.
                  
               
               whereby they boaſt they can
               Soothſaie the chances good and ill,
               which happen ſhall to man:
               The Hieſt lyne they attribute
               vnto Saturnus oulde,
                     The line of Saturne.
                  
               
               Which being playne, vncroſſed, straight,
               
               and ſmooth; then are they bold
               To ſaie, that in their latter age,
               good fortune there ſhallbe.
               But contrarie, if that this line,
               all croſsed they do ſee,
               All next vnto the ſame, the line
               of Iupiter doth lie;
               (Which ſignifies the middle age,
                     The line of Iupiter.
                  )
               to him, they do applie
               The giuing of good quallities,
               as Honeſtie, and Grace,
               And for to be Religious,
               and for to beare a place
               Of Prelate, Iudge, or Magiſtrates
               in ſuch things ſhall he gaine,
               VVho hath this line, both fortunate,
               
                  Vncroſſed, ſmooth, and plaine;
               But if it croked be, or cut,
               
               
                  and croſſed therewithall;
               Then ſhall he rather looſe in theſe,
               or little gaine he ſhall.
               
                  
                     The line of Mars.
                  The next to this, lyes Mars his lyne,
               who gouerns (as they ſay)
               The fierie and the furious folke,
               and makes them for to play
               Their priſes in the blooddie warrs,
               where Captaines ſome he makes,
               And ſome ſeditious Souldiers proue,
               and ſome of them he takes,
               And makes them Smithes, and Armorers;
               and Alcumiſts of ſome:
               All Butchers, Bakers, Barbers too,
               By meanes of Mars, do come:
               The Surgeons and the Sarieants both,
               yea ſome muſt Hangmen be,
               If Mars be not aſſpected well
               in their natiuitie:
               If that this line be Long and straight,
               
               
                  Vncroſsed ſmooth and plaine,
               
               Then thoſe that vſe theſe faculties,
               ſhall haue exceeding gaine:
               But if it Croked be, and cutt,
               
               and Croſſed; by and by,
               They Iudge the owner of the ſame,
               ſome violent death ſhall die.
               All next to this, another line,
               
                  
                     The two lines of Sol and Luna.
                  both Long and Slender lies,
               The which the Phiſiognomers
               
               amonſt them do deuiſe,
               
                  In parcels two for to deuide
               the right ſide of the ſame,
               They ſay to be the line of Soll;
               
               and of the left they frame,
               A line to Lady Luna: but,
               to Soll, they ſay pertaine
               For to diſpoſe of dignities,
                     Firſt of the line of Sol.
                  
               
               of Lordſhips, and to gaine
               By honorable offices;
               in Credit eke to be
               With thoſe that are great maieſtrats,
               the rather if they ſee
               The lyne of Soll to be both ſmooth,
               
               and there withall to haue
               No Cutte, or Croſſings ouerwhart,
               
               for elſe they do perceyue
               The influence that Soll do giue
               is by ſome ill aſpect;
               Of ſome ill Signe or Planet mard,
               and brought to none effect.
               The left ſide line for Luna lies,
                     The line of Luna.
                  
               
               who doth enrych all thoſe
               Which haunteth nauigation;
               and eke ſhe doth diſpoſe
               Of Legates, and Imbaſſadours,
               and with Atturnies too,
               With Benchers, and with trauellers,
               ſhe hath ſomwhat to doe:
               If that her lyne be fortunate,
               ſhe giues them good ſucceſſe;
               But i
                     •

                  ſhe benefits the leſſe.
               
                  
                     The Eye-browes.
                  Betwixt the foreſayd Pentiſes,
               
               two certaine Lines there lyes,
               VVhich if the endes of both of them,
               chaunce vpward to aryſe,
               And meete together in the topp,
               and make an Angle there,
               
                  
                     The line of Mercurie.
                  Then Mercurie doth promiſe that,
               hee neede not for to feare;
               That is, the owner of that Houſe▪
               
               for luckie ſhall he bee,
               (The rather) if an vnright line
               betwixt them both we ſee:
               If Mercurie be fortunate,
               in a Natiuitie,
               Hee cauſeth one an Orator
               or Poet, for to bee:
               And teacheth very well to ſpeake,
               and very well to wrighte,
               A Secretarie eke to bee,
               and skilfull to indite:
               And good in Mathematicals,
               and in Arithmaticke:
               A witt and a capacitie,
               he cauſeth very quicke:
               But being found vnfortunate
               in any birth, they ſay,
               That all his Influence doth worke
               a cleane contrary way:
               The longer all the lines do reach,
               
               
                  the ſmoother, and more plaine,
               
               
                  So much the more they luckie be,
               and longer life retaine.
               But if no Angle Croſſe or Line,
                  
                     Croſſes or ouerthwart lines be vnluckie.
                  
               
               (which ouerthwart we call)
               Vpon this foreſayd Front appeare
               nor yet be ſeene at all,
               A ſinguler moſt happie lucke,
               or fortune then hee haue,
               That is the owner of the Houſe,
               and ſhall haue to his graue.
               Though all the Houſes there, ſuch fronts
               and places do poſſeſſe,
               Yet haue they not all Lines alike,
               but ſome haue more or leſſe:
               For ſome haue foure, three, or two,
               Yea many haue but one;
               But very ſeldome do it chaunce,
               if any Houſe haue none:
               For then vpon the ſame (they ſay)
               no Iudgement can be giuen,
               No more then on a Dials ſquare,
                     A ſimilitude
                  
               
               which beeing ſmooth and euen,
               Doth want his Lines to iudge vpon;
               without the which we ſhall
               Perceiue no more how howers paſſe,
               then on a painted wall.
               And many other odd conceites
               I ſaw within the ſame,
               Which now for lacke of memorie,

               Long ſtood I looking on theſe Lines,

                     •••…
                  e ſeemd to heare
               A voyce, that ſafely ſayd to mee,
               thus whiſpering in mine eare.
               
                  
                     The Art is vaine and vncertaine.
                  
                  Leaue off to view thoſe vanities;
               
               For though the Art doth ſhow
               Great cunning for to be in it:
               and though that God (we know)
               In vaine hath nothing made in man,
               Yet ſince that it is found
               The chiefeſt rules of all this Art,
               yea and his greateſt ground,
               Stands but on obſeruations,
               and on coniectures fraile:
               How can we cenſure of the ſame,
               but that we needes muſt faile,
               Of Infants lines, and ſuch as be
               
                  
                     The lines of Infants, old-men, and labouring men.
                  exceeding leane, or old;
               No man can rightly iudge vpon,
               as Learned men haue told?
               And as this voyce ſtill talked on,
               I chaunſt to looke aſide,
               Where I an Auncient man all clad
               in ſundry cullours ſpide;
               And after we each other had
               ſaluted, by and by
               I did intreate him that he would
               vouchſafe not to deny
               His name, for to declare to me,
               and what he did intend,
               By clyming of theſe places hie,
               and hither to aſſend.
               
                  Then courteouſly he ſpake to me,
               and did this anſwere frame:
               I called am Pampirus;
                  
                     Pampirus omnia expertus.
                   and
               according to my name,
               To Countries, Realmes, and Nations, and
               to places farre and neere,
               Their Cuſtomes, and their Orders, for
               to know, to ſee, and heare,
               I trauell: that experience
               in all things I mought haue:
               And when that I haue got thereof
               as much as I would craue,
               I do impart the ſame vnto
               
                  Philotimus: for why,
                     
                        Philotimus amans veritatem.
                     
                     
                        Experience and trueth ought to goe togither.
                     
                  
               
               As Trauellers togither, goe
               
                  Philotimus and I:
               This is the man, his voyce it was
               which lately you did heare:
               With that a plaine and comely wight,
               did preſently appeare;
               His countenance was very graue,
               and auncient for to ſee:
               But yet a cleere and liuely grace,
               In him there ſeemd to bee▪
               
               His name importes a louer of
               things honeſt, good, and true:
               His cloathing ſhewd no leſſe; which was
               of cullours White and Blue:
               And after ſalutations done,
               the other did not ſtay,
               But fell into his former ſpeach,
               
                  and thus began to ſay.
               Now for our comming to this place,
               
                  
                     Pampirus goeth forward with his ſpeach to the Author.
                  you are to vnderſtand,
               It was our happ of late to heare,
               of one that tooke in hand
               For to deſcribe in euery part,
               the Body of a Man,
               Both inwardly and outwardly,
               from topp to toe: and than,
               Compareth it vnto an Houſe,
               that hath in it great ſtore
               Of needfull thinges; well gouerned
               by one of worth: and more,
               Applyeth euery part which in
               the Body wee do ſee,
               Vnto ſome neceſſarie thing,
               which in an Houſe ſhould bee.
               And furthermore, report doth goe,
               (If we may credite fame)
               That he that made this Symilie,
               ſo aptly did it frame,
               That it vnto a Common-wealth,
               compared well may bee.
               Much more thereof beſides, wee heare,
               which is the cauſe that wee
               Do hither come: and for aſmuch
               as that it is a lore,
               That hath not yet in ſuch a ſort,
               been dealt withall before,
               By any man: wherefore we craue,
               (if you the partie bee,
               
                  That deales herein) you will declare
               the ſame in each degree.
               And for a new experience
               I will the ſame forth ſhow.
               And I too (quoth Philotimus)
               thincke to applie it ſo,
               As that ſome good and godly vſe
               may of the ſame be made.
               And thus, when as this auntient man
               his minde hereof had ſayd,
               Vpon this aunſwer, then my ſelfe
               did make him this replie.
                     The authors reply.
                  
               
               Your reaſons which you heere alledge,
               I can not well denie.
               Yet cauſe of great diſcouragment,
               I ſee before my face:
               For why, the Curious they will carpe,
               and ſeeke for to diſgrace
               The thing which now you do perſwade:
               thereof the ſetting foorth,
               And ſay that I (for want of ſkill)
               haue made it nothing woorth.
               And ſome will thinke me arrogant,
               becauſe I vndertake
               To wright hereof, and make report,
               that for vaine-glories ſake,
               I do the ſame: whereas in deede
               the Truth is otherwiſe.
                     The cauſe why the Authaer did deuiſe this Booke.
                  
               
               For why, the onely cauſe for which
               I did the ſame deuiſe,
               Was for mine onely priuate vſe,
               
                  that many times thereby,

               my ſelfe might edifie:
               And though my paines ſhall not to ſome,
               do any good at all:
               Yet ſu
                     ••
                   I am that harme thereby,

               with you to condiſcend,
               Hoping you will as you haue ſaid,

                     The authors application of this his former deuiſe.
                  Almighty God in Paradice,
               
               when he created man
               Of Soule, and eke of Body both,
               he did create him than,
               With Sence he did this Soule indue,
               which was celeſtiall,
               And eke with Reaſon for to rule
               the Body there withall.
               
                  
                     A ſimilitude
                  This Body then (I ſay) is like,
               an Houſe, in each degree;
               The Soule, the owner of the Houſe
               
               I do account to bee;
               As touching firſt this Body then,
               I did of late declare,
               
                  
                     A compariſō
                     
                  It like an Houſe in euery poynt:
               but now I will compare
               
                  
                     or Body.
                  This Houſe vnto a Common wealth
               Or as a Cittie faire:
               Or like a Corporation,
               
                  conſiſting of a Mayer,
               And many other Officers,
               there needefull to be had.
               And Commons too: amongſt the which
               are people good and bad:
               And therefore need of gouernment,
               ſuch people for to guide,
               And as each Towne and Common wealth
               Or Cittie: hath beſide
               Appoynted places for to kepe
               their Courtes of Common law;
               Yea and their Courts of Conſcience too,
               to kepe theſe men in awe
               So hath each Houſe his magiſtrates,
                     or Body.
                  
               
               and officers to ſerue
               Yea Commons too: and places fitt,
               for Courts, which do deſerue
               Good magiſtrates to ſit in them.
               But let vs firſt of all
               Speake of the Chireſt Seate which late
               thou ſaweſt in the Hall.
                  
                     or Body.
                   
                  The Heart of man is the Court of good Conſcience, when Grace fitteth there as chiefe Iuſtice. Theſe be the ordinary attendants vpon the court of a good Conſcience. Viz. Good thoughts.
                  
               
               The chiefeſt Seate in euery Houſe
               
               it is the Hart of man
               VVherein if that the Sperit of Grace
               
               do ſit as Iudge, euen than
               
                  The Court of Conſcience very well
               we may it call: but ſee,
               Theſe Officers vpon this Court
               allwayes attendant bee.
               
                  Good thoughts, and motions of the minde
               and next to theſe proceede

                  Good wordes, and eke Good deedes:
               
               Yea Faith, and Loue, and Charitie,
               
               
                  Obedience, and Care
               
               
                  To liue vpright, and Pacience,
               
               and eke a Godly Feare:
               
               And Mercy, that moſt willingly
               forgiueth euery wrong:
               And Hope, that lookes for happie life,
               although delayes be long:
               And Thankefulneſſe, that with goodwill,
               doth benefites requite:
               And Pittie, that compaſion takes
               of thoſe in ruthfull plight:
               
                  
                     
                        Ʋertue. Meekenes. Innocencie.
                  And Vertue, that doth Vice abhorre,
               and Meekenes, eke ſo milde,
               That loues to be as Innocent,
               
               as any little Childe.
               And many ſuch like Officers,
               vpon this Iudge attend,
               To execute his warrants, when
               he doth abroad them ſende.
               And if all theſe doe faythfully
               their offices: why ſhall
               We not of right, ſuch officers,
               Good Officers them call?
               But when out of this Court (alas)
               
                  
                     The cauſe why Grace fayle vs, is our owne corruption.
                  this rightuous Iudge is gone,
               (For many times he doth depart,
               and leaue this Court alone,
               Becauſe the Seate wherein this Iudge
               
                  doth vſe to ſit, is ſeene
               Oft times to be corrupted,
                  
                     By originall Sinne.
                   and
               
                  defiled, and vncleene,)
               Another ſtraight vſurpes the roomth,
                     When Grace doth faile the Diuell preuaile.
                  
               
               and ſitting in the place,
               Workes all the meanes he can deuiſe,
               the Court for to deface:
               Much like vnto the Parrable,
               
               which we in Mathew reede,
                     A Parable.
                  
               
               Of one that ſowed in his ground
               both good and perfect Seede:
               But while men ſlept, his Enemie
               vpon this Land did ſow
               Great ſtore of Tares among the Wheate,
               and then away did goe.
               So Sathan, with his helliſh crue,
               this place doth enter in,
               And ſitting there as Magiſtrate,
               his Court he doth begin:
               About him then flocks all his traine,
                     theſe be companions to the court of a bad Conſcience: viz. Pride. Diſdaine. L

               (like to a ſwarme of Bees)

               Now of the Commons for to ſpeake
               ſomewhat, I will proceede:
               As Commons for the greater part,
               conſiſt of men of Trade,
               Artificers, and Laborers,
               and ſuch as vſe haue made
               Both apt and fit for that which ſhould,

                     A ſimilitude
                  
               
               Without the which, a Comon-wealth,

               Euen ſo in euery Body, or

               Great Packes & burdens, when they are
               commaunded to do ſo.
               It hath Intelligencers, which

               It hath likewiſe his Clergie men,

                  Though many do affirme (quoth hee)

               Mans Body for to be a Sacke,

               All which is true, if with the Soule,
               we do the ſame compare.
               For why, the Soule Gods Image is,
                     What the Soule is.

               As touching this our Body ſuer,
               God hath beſtowde on it

               Euen from the ſtate of Common-wealths,
               do differ not a whit.
               And whyt becauſe all Common-wealths
               do of our Bodyes come,
               And when our Bodyes ceaſe to bee,
               then Common-wealths are done.
               And as a Realme, a Common-wealth,
               a Cittie, or a Towne,
               Cannot continue long, but is
               in ſtate of falling downe,
               If that the Common-people, which

               Doe not together ioyne as one,
               their ſtate for to maintaine.
               And as an Houſe muſt needes decay,
               and all that longe there to,
               If thoſe that dwell therein neglect
               the things that they ſhould do.
               Euen ſo it with our Bodyes ſtands:
               for if it ſo befall
               The Eye, the Eare, the Hand, the Foote,
               the parts and members all,
               Ioyne nor together all as one,
               the Body to ſuſtaine,
               wee ſee by dayly proofe, the Body
               
               cannot long remaine.
               And euen as in a Common-wealth,
               a Cittie, or a Towne,
               There ought to be good Magiſtrates,
               
                  to kepe the wicked downe.
               And as in euery Houſe there ought
               a Gouernour to bee
               Amongſt the people in the ſame,
               good order for to ſee:
               Euen ſo in euery Body; in

               the which may gouerne well:
               Or eke the Realme; the Common-wealth;

               the Cittie; or the Towne:
               Yea and the Soule, and Body too,
               (though things of great renowne)
               Cannot endure: but needs muſt fall.
               to ruine and decay,
               The proofe thereof by ruling ill,
               too often ſee we may.
               As Corporations, Citties, Townes,
               and Villages a ſort,
               The better for to gouerne them,
               haue oftentimes their Court:
               As well Eccleſiaſticall,
               as of the Common Lawes.
               So euery man within his Houſe,
               
               (and in him ſelfe) haue cauſe,
               To ſee that both theſe Courts be kept:
               the firſt of them to keepe,

               and in the Conſcience deepe.
               The other Court muſt houlden be,
               
                  for matters that depende
               Twixt man and man, right for to doe,
               and wrong for to amende.
               Each ſeuerall Court, hath ſeuerall Rules

               And for the keeping of theſe Courts,
               
                  
                     The application of the keeping of theſe Courts.
                  we thus muſt vnderſtand,
               That euery good and faythfull man,
               muſt dayly take in hand
               For to examine well himſelfe,
               his thoughts, his words, and works,
               And Looke if any wickednes,
               in any of them lurks:
               And if he chaunce ſome faults to ſpie,
               as doutles but he ſhall,
               That then vnto the Lord-chiefe-Iudge,
               he faythfully do call
               For pardon for his former faults:
               and do as is before
               Directed him: and then I thinke,
               he need to do no more.
               Thus briefly haue I ſhewed my minde:
               and now, becauſe the day)
               Comes on apace, and that (quoth they)
               
                  we needs muſt hence a way:
               We leaue you till another time,
               when we may talke our fill.
               I rather wiſh you would (quoth I)
               abide and tarry ſtill.
               But when our leaue, each one of vs
               did of each other take,
               The ſorrow I conceiu'd thereof,
               did cauſe me for to wake:
               And when I ſawe my ſelfe in bed,
               I roſe vp preſently,
               And went and tooke my pen in hand,
               and Wrote downe by and by
               (So neare as I could call to minde)
               what I before had ſeene:
               And all the talke, and conference,
               which paſſed vs betweene.
               If any ſhall hereafter ſeeme
               for to miſlike of this,
               I craue they would vouchſaue to mende
               what here they finde amiſſe.
               And here I ende; wiſhing theſe things,
               may be as well applide,
               And to no worſer ende, then in
               this booke is ſpecifide.
            
            FINIS.
