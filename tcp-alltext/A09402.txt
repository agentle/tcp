of the holy Ghost in these and such like attributes,
is, to expresse that measure of policie and

by long experience, and instantly practised

               ne language, or informe an Art by Rules of
his owne deuising; he might haply incurre suspicion
of falshood. Hereupon he composeth
his courses 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , by way of counterfait and
imitation, not of the actions and dealings of
men, but of the order of Gods owne proceeding
with his Church; holding it a sure principle
in policie, That actions will be much more
effectuall, when they be framed vnto the best
presidents, then when they are suted to the direction
of meaner examples. To this purpose,
as God hath made a Couenant with his
Church, binding himselfe by promise to be
their God, and requiring of them the condition
of faith and obedience; so doth Satan indent
with his Subiects by mutuall confederacie,
either solemnly or secretly; whereby they
bind themselues on the one part to obserue his
Rules, and he on the other to accomplish their
desires. Againe, God giues his Word, the Interpreter
of his will, and his Sacraments, the

                  •
               eales of his promises, to which beeing rightly
administred and receiued, he hath tied his own
presence, and the worke of his grace in them
that beleeue. Answerably to this, the Deuill
giues a word of direction to his Instruments,

and addeth vnto it, Charmes, Figures, Characters,
and other outward Ceremonies, at the
vse whereof he hath bound himselfe to be present,
and to manifest his power in effecting the
thing desired. Furthermore, God hath reuealed
his will to the Patriarchs, Prophets, and
Apostles, by familiarGen. 18. 17. conference, byNum. 1

               s Heathen. Yea, and at
this day, as the Ministers of God doe giue resolution
to the conscience in matters doubtfull
and difficult: so the ministers of Satan, vnder
the name of Wise-men, and Wise-women, are
at hand, by his appointment, to resolue, direct,
and helpe ignorant and vnsetled persons, in cases
of distraction, losse, or other outward calamities.
            Now the Grounds whereupon he buildeth
his proceedings for certentie, are cunningly gathered
from the disposition of mans heart, by
naturall all corruption, and that in three speciall
instances. First, he knowes that Man naturally

out of the light of grace, hath but1. Cor. 2. 14. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . 
               a meere
Saule, indued onely with some generall and
confused notions; and as for matters of deeper
apprehension touching God and heauenly
things, there is a vaile of ignorance and blindnesse
drawne ouer the eyes of his mind. Wherupon,
though he be apt to know and worship
a God, and learne his will, yet for want of information
by the word, he is prone to erre in
the practise of his notion. Here Satan applies
himselfe to mans measure, and at his owne will,
drawes the minde into error, by his delusions,
and impostures. This made the2. king. 17. 29. I

                  u. Thirdly, there is a naturall
Distemper in the minde of man, shewing
it selfe in these particulars, That he cannot endure
to stand in feare of imminent daunger;

That he swells in an high conceit of his owne
deserts, specially when he is in lower estate,
then he would be; That he will not beare a
wrong done, without reuenge; That he rests
not satisfied, with the measure of knowledge
receiued, but affecteth the searching of things
secret, and not reuealed. When the minde is
possessed with these troubled passions, with
care to helpe it selfe; then comes the Deuill,
and ministreth occasion to vse vnlawf
                  •
               ll means
in the generall, and forceth the minde by continuall
suggestion, to determine it selfe in particular
vpon his owne crafts. It was the case
of1. Sam 28. Saul, and ofDan. 2. 1, 2. Nebuchadnetsar. It caused
many of the Heathen Philosophers, to go from
Athens to Memphis, from Grecia to Syria, from
men on earth to wicked Spirits in hell, to get
more illumination at the hands of the Prince of
darkenesse. It mooued sundrie

and thereby to manifest indeed, that they were
not the true Successors of Simon Peter, but
heyres of the vertues of Simon that Magus,
who bewitched the people of Samaria, and
professed to doe that by the great power of
God, which he wrought by the ayde and assistance
of the Deuill.
            If any doe thinke it strange, that Satan
should in this sort oppose himselfe to the kingdome
of God, and maintaine his owne principalitie,

by such vngodly arts and exercises;August. Enchirid. cap. 95. & 96.
They must knowe, that this and all other euills
come to passe euen by the will of God, who
hath iustly permitted the same; To punish the
wicked for their horrible sin

vnto him, will not beleeue or obey it; To waken
and rowze vp the godly, who are sleeping
in any great sinnes or infirmities; Lastly, to
trie and prooue his people, whether they will
cleaue to him and his word,Deut. 13. 3. or seeke vnto Satan
and wicked Spirits.
            Now from the consideration of the premisses,
we conclude it a necessarie thing for the
Church and people of God, to be acquainted
with the dealing of Satan in this kinde, that
knowing his subtill deuises, they may learne to
auoyd them. For which purpose this Treatise
was first framed, and now exhibited to your
Lordship. The iust commendation whereof,
aboue others formerly divulged touching this
Argument, appeareth herein, that it serueth to
the full opening and declaration of Satans Methode
in the ground and practises of Witchcraft.
Wherein among many other remarkable
points, it may please you to take speciall notice
of these particulars. I. That they doe grossely
erre, who either in expresse tearmes denie that
there be Witches, or in effect, and by consequent;
auouching that there is no league betweene
them and the Deuill; or affirming they

can doe no such miraculous workes, as are
ascribed to them. The former issueth plainly
our of the bodie of the Discourse. And for the
latter; That there is a Couenant betweene
them, either explicite in manner and forme, or
implicite by degrees of superstitious proceeding
in the vse of meanes insufficient in themselues;
is plainely taught and confirmed in the
same. That Witches may and doe worke wonders,
is euidently prooued; howbeit not by an
omnipotent power,

                     •
                  , non Miracula. but workes
of wonder, because they exceede the ordinarie
power and capacitie of men, especially such as
are ignorant of Satans habilitie, and the hidden
causes in nature, whereby things are brought to
passe. II. That the Witch truely conuicted,
is to be punished with death, the highest degree
of punishment; and that by the Lawe of
Moses, the equitie whereof is perpetuall. Yea
euen the better Witch of the two in common
reputation, because both are equally enemies
to God, and all true religion; and it is well
knowne by true experience, that all professed
Sorc
                  •
               rers, are guiltie of many most monstrous
impieties. III. That the Miracles of the
Popish Church at this day, are indeed either no
Miracles, or false and deceitfull workes. Touching

corporall presence in the Sacrament, which
they affirme to be by miracle; If it were true,
then miracles were not yet ceased, but should
still be as ordinarie in the Church, as are the Sacraments.
A point not onely confuted in the
latter part of this Treatise,Lib. de civ. Dei. 22. c. 8. but also by the
testimonie of purer Antiquitie. Augustine
saith, That miracles were once necessarie to
make the world beleeue the Gospel; but he that
now seekes a signe that he may beleeue, is a wonder,
yea 
                     •

                  〈◊〉

                     •
                  . imperfect. that there
is now in the Church, no necessitie of working
Miracles; and calles him a false Prophet that
now takes in hand to worke them. Againe, if
there be a miracle in the Sacrament, it is contrarie
to the nature of all those that were
wrought, either by Moses and the Prophets, or
by Christ, and his Apostles. For they were
apparent to the eye, but this is insensible; and
therfore neither of 
                  •
               orce to mooue admiration,
nor to conuince the minde of man, and make
him to beleeue. As for those, which are pretended
to be wrought by Saints in that church;
if we make recourse to the Primitiue times,
wherein God gaue the gift, to breede faith in
the Gentiles; we shall finde that the power of
producing such workes, was neuer actually inherent
in the Apostles,Act. 3. 12. 16. but dispensed by their▪
               in the Name of Christ: Neither was it in their
libertie, to worke miracles, when they would,

                neither the
power nor the will was in them, much lesse
is it likely to be sound in any of the Saints.
And for their Reliques, of what name soeuer,
so greatly magnified and resorted vnto;
we denie there is any such vertue in them. For
they may not be thought to be more effectuall
then the hem of Christs garment, from which
the power of healing the woman did not proceede,
but from himself

patronage, that vnder your protection
they may freely passeth the common view of

in at hand; That all by-respects 
                  〈◊〉
                part,
I haue beene hereunto induced many waies.
First, vpon a reuerent opinion of those rare gifts
of knowledge and pietie; wherewith God hath
beautified your person, 
                  •
               nd thereby aduanced
you to high place, and estimation in this Common-wealth;
Whereof those your graue and
indicious speeches, euen in the weightiest matters
touching God and Cesar, as also those many
learned writings, haue giuen large testimonie.
Frō which hath issued the greatnes of your
Name, both in the present iudgement of the
world, and in future expectation. Next out
of a resolued perswasion of your Honourable
disposition, as in generall to the whole house of
Leui, so particularly to those, whose labours
haue fruitfully flowed out of the Schooles of
the Prophets, amongst whome the Author of
this booke, in his time, was none of the meanest.
Lastly, by the consideration of the Argument
arising out of a Law Iudiciall, agreeable
to the calling and qualitie of a Iudge. A
Law penall in regard of the offence, and therefore
sutable to his proceedings, whose office is
to heare with fauour, to determine with equitie,
to execute iustice with moderation. A law
of the highest, and greatest weight, immediately
concerning God and his Honour, and
therefore appertaining to him,De

place of God, to maintane his right, that he may
be with him, in the cause and iudgement.
            
            
               
By such Motiues, I haue incouraged my

vnder assurance of your Lordships pardon, to
present you with that, wherein you are most
deseruedly interessed; further intreating your
fauourable interpretation and acceptance, both
of the qualitie of the Worke, and of the paines
of the Publisher. And thus heartily wishing
to your Lordship increase of grace and honour,
with a daily influence of blessing and direction
from heauen, vpon your graue consultations
and employments, I humbly take my leaue, and
commend you to the grace of God, by whome
doe rule all the Iudges of the earth.

            A Discourse of Witchcraft.
            
               Exod. 22. 18.
               Thou shalt not suffer a Witch to liue.
            
            
               THis text containeth one
of the Iudiciall Lawes
of Moses touching the
punishment of Witchcraft:
which argument I
haue chosen to intreat
of, for these causes:
            First, because Witchcraft is arife and
common sinne in these our daies, and
very many are intangled with it, beeing
either practitioners thereof in their
owne persons, or at the least, yeilding to
seeke for helpe and counsell of such as
practise it.
            Againe, there be sundrie men who

receiue it for a truth, that Witchcraft is
nothing else but a meere illusion, and
Witches nothing but persons deluded
by the Deuill: and this opinion takes
place not onely with the ignorant, but
is holden and maintained by such as are
learned, who doe auouch it by word
and writing, that there be no witches,
but as I said before.
            Vpon these and such like considerations,
I haue beene mooued to vndertake
the Interpretation of this Iudiciall
law, as a sufficient ground of the doctrine
which shall be deliuered. In handling
whereof, two things are distinctly
to be considered. The first, what is a
Witch. The second, what is her due and
deserued punishment. And both these
beeing opened and handled, the whole
meaning of the law will the better appeare.
            For the first. To giue the true descriptiō
of a Witch, is a matter of great
difficultie, because there be many differences
and diuersities of opinions touching
this point; and therefore that we
may properly and truly define a Witch,

we must first pause a while in opening
the nature of Witchcraft, so farre forth
as it is deliuered in the bookes of the
Old and New Testament, and may be
gathered out of the true experience of
learned and godly men.
            Touching Witchcraft therefore I
will consider three points:

                  I. What witchcraft is.
                  II. What is the ground of the
whole practise thereof.
                  III. How many kinds and differences
there be of it.
               
            
            
               CHAP. I.
               Of the Nature of
Witchcraft.
               
                  TO begin with the first:
According to the true
meaning of all the places
of holy Scripture
which treate of this
point, it may be thus described:
               
                  Witchcraft is a wicked Arte, seruing
for the working of wonders, by the assistance

of the Deuill, so farre forth as
God shall in iustice permit.
               
               
                  Sect. I.
                  I say it is an Arte, because it is commonly
so called and esteemed amongst
men, and there is reason why it should
be thus tearmed. For as in all good and
lawfull arts, the whole practise thereof
is performed by certaine rules and precepts,
and without them nothing can
be done: so Witchcraft hath certaine
superstitious grounds and principles
whereupon it standeth, and by which alone
the seats and practises thereof are
commonly performed.
                  If it be demaunded, what these rules
be, and whence they had their beginning,
considering that euery Arte hath
reference to some author, by whom it
was originally taught and deliuered? I
answer, that they weare deuised first by
Satan, and by him reuealed to wicked
and vngodly persons of auncient times,
as occasion serued: who receiuing them
from him, became afterward, in the iust
iudgement of God, his instruments to

report and conuey them to others from
hand to hand.
                  For manifestation whereof, it is to be
considered, that God is not onely in
generall a Soueraigne Lord and King
ouer all his creatures, whether in heauen
or earth, none excepted, no not the
deuills themselues; but that he exerciseth
also a speciall kingdome, partly of
grace in the Church militant vpon
earth, and partly of glorie ouer the
Saints and Angels, members of the
Church triumphant in heauen. Now
in like manner the Deuill hath a kingdome,
called in Scripture the kingdom
of darknes, whereof himselfe is the head
and gouernour, for which cause he is
tearmed

                     the Prince of darknes,

                        . 
                     the God
of this world, ruling and effectually working
in the hearts of the children of disobedience.
                  Againe, as God hath enacted Laws,
whereby his kingdome is gouerned, so
hath the deuill his ordinances, whereby
he keepeth his subiects in awe and obedience,
which generally and for substance,
are nothing else but transgressions

of the very lawe of God. And amongst
thē all, the precepts of Witchcraft
are the very chiefe and most notorious.
For by them especially he holds
vp his kingdome, and therefore more
esteemeth the obedience of them, then
of other. Neither doth he deliuer them
indifferently to euery man, but to his
owne subiects, the wicked; and not to
them all, but to some speciall and tried
ones, whome he most betrusteth with
his secrets, as beeing the fittest to serue
his turne, both in respect of their willingnesse
to learne and practise, as also
for their abilitie to become instruments
of the mischiefe, which he intendeth to
others.
                  If it be here asked, whence the deuill
did fetch and conceiue his rules? I answer,
out of the corruption and deprauation
of that great measure of knowledge
he once had of God, and of all the
duties of his seruice. For that beeing
quite depraued by his fall, he turnes
the same to the inuenting and deuising
of what he is possibly able, against God
and his honour. Hereupon, well perceiuing

that God hath expressely commanded
to renounce, and abhorre all
practises of Whitchcraft, he hath set abroach
this art in the world, as a maine
pillar of his kingdome, which notwithstanding
is flatly and directly opposed
to one of the maine principall lawes of
the kingdome of God, touching the
seruice of himselfe in spirit and truth.Ioh. 4. 
                           •
                        4.
                  
                  Againe, the reason why he conueies
these vngodly principles and practises
from man to man is, because he finds in
experience, that things are farre more
welcome and agreeable to the common
nature of mankinde, which are
taught by man like vnto themselues,
then if the deuill should personally deliuer
the same to each man in speciall.
Hereupon, he takes the course at first to
instruct some fewe onely, who beeing
taught by him, are apt to conuey that
which they know to others. And hence
in probabilitie this deuillish trade, had
his first originall and continuance.

                      first temptation,

whereby the deuill preuailed against

many sinnes: for the eating of the forbidden
fruit, was no small or single offence,
but as some haue taught, contained
in it the breach of euery commandement
of the Morall lawe. Amongst
the rest, Satan laboured to bring them
to the sinne of discontentment, whereby
they sought to become as Gods; that
is, better then God had made them, not
resting content with the condition of

                     ie, and now is become so common
a corruption in the whole nature
of flesh and blood, that there is scarce a
man to be found; vvho is not originally
tainted therevvith as he is a man.
                  This corruption shevves it selfe principally
in tvvo things, both vvhich are
the maine causes of the practises of
Witchcraft.
                  First, in mans outwardest

beeing naturally possessed with a loue
of himselfe, and an high conceit of his

owne deseruing, when he liues in base
and low estate, whether in regard of pouertie,
or want of honour and reputation,
which he thinkes by right is due vnto
him: he then growes to some measure
of griefe and sorrow within himselfe.
Hereupon, he is mooued to yeeld
himselfe to the deuill, to be his vassall
and scholler in this wicked art, supposing
that by the working of some wonders,
he may be able in time to releeue
his pouerty, and to purchase to himselfe
credit and countenance amongst men.
                  It were easie to shew the truth of this,
by examples of some persons, who by
these meanes haue risen from nothing,
to great places and preferments in the
world. In stead of all, it appeareth in

that by the working of wonders, they
might rise frō one step of honour to another,
vntill they had seated themselues

in the chaire of the Papacie. So great
was their desire of eminencie in the
Church, that it caused them to dislike
meaner conditions of life, and neuer to
cease aspiring, though they incurred
thereby the hazard of good conscience,
and the losse of their soules.
                  The scond degree of discontentment,August. confess. l. 10. c. 35
is in the minde and inward man;
and that is curiositie, when a man resteth
not satisfied with the measure of inward
gifts receiued, as of knowledge, wit,
vnderstanding, memorie, and such like,
but aspires to search out such things as
God would haue kept secret: and hence
he is mooued to attempt the cursed art
of Magicke and witchcraft, as a way to
get further knowledge in matters secret
and not reueiled, that by working of
wonders, he may purchase fame in the
world, and consequently reape more
benefit by such vnlawfull courses, then
in likelihood he could haue done, by ordinarie
and lawfull meanes.
               
               
                  Sect. IV.
                  Fourthly, it is affirmed in the description,

that Witchcraft is practised by the
assistance of the Deuill, yet the more fully
to distinguish it from all good, lawfull,
and commendable arts. For in them experience
teacheth, that the Arts-master
is able by himselfe to practise his art, &
to doe things belonging thereunto,
without the help of another. But in this
it is otherwise; for here the worke is
done by the helpe of another, namely,
the Deuill, who is confederate with the
Witch. The power of effecting such
strange works, is not in the art, neither
doth it flow from the skill of the sorcerer,
man-or-woman, but is deriued
wholly▪ from Satan, and is brought into
execution by vertue of mutuall consederacie▪
betweene him and the Magician.
                  Now that this part of the description
may be more clearely manifested,

                        〈…〉
                      procede to a further point,

                        〈…〉
                      kind of wonders they be
which are ordinarily wrought by the
ministerie and power of the deuill.
                  § 1. Wonders therefore be of two
sorts; either true and plaine, or lying

and deceitfull.
                  A true wonder is a rare worke, done
by the power of God simply, either aboue,
or against the power of nature,
and it is properly called a miracle. The
Scripture is plentifull in examples of
this kind. Of this sort, was the deuiding
of the redde sea, and making it drie land
by a mighty east wind, that the children
of Israel might passe through it, Exod.
14. 21. For though the East wind be naturall
of great force to mooue the waters,
and to drie the earth; yet to part
the sea asunder, and to make the waters
to stand as walls on each side, and the
bottome of the sea as a pauement, this is
a worke simply aboue the naturall power
of any wind, and therefore is a miracle.
Again, such were the wonders done
by Moses and Aaron before Pharaoh in
Egypt, one whereof, in stead of many,
was the turning of Aarons rodde into a
serpent, a worke truely miraculous. For
it is aboue the power of naturall generation,
that the substance of on creature
should be really turned into the substance
of another, as the substance of a

roode into the substance of a serpent.
Of the like kinde, were the standing
of the Sunne in the firmament without
moouing in his course, for a whole
day, losh. 10. 13. the going backe of
the Sunne in the firmament tenne degrees,
2. King. 20. 11. the preseruation
of the three men, Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abednego in the midst of the hoat
fierie fornace, Dan. 3. 25. and of Daniel
in the lyons den, Dan. 6. 22. the feeding
of fiue thousand men, beside women
and children, with fiue loaues and two
fishes, Matth. 14. 20. 21. the curing of
the eyes of the bling man, with spittle
and clay tempered together, Ioh. 9. 6. 7.
&c.
                  Now the effecting of a miracle in
this kind, is a work proper to God onely;
and no creature, man, or Angel, can
doe any thing either aboue or contrarie
to nature, but he alone which is the
Creator. For as God in the beginning
made all things of nothing, so he hath
reserued to himselfe, as a peculiar work
of his almightie power, to change or
abolish the substance, propertie, motion

and vse of any creature. The reason is,
because he is the author and creator of
nature, and therefore at his pleasure, is
perfectly able to command, restraine,
enlarge, or extend the power & strēgth
thereof, without the helpe or assistance
of the creature.
                  Againe, the working of a miracle is
a kind of creation, for therein a thing is
made to be, which was not before. And
this must needs be proper to God alon,
by whose power, things that are, were
once produced out of things that did
not appeare. The conclusion therefore
must needs be this, which Dauid confesseth
in the Psalme: God onely doth wondrous
things, Psalme 136. 4. that is, works
simply wonderfull.
                  But it is alleadged to the contrarie,
that the Prophets in the old Testament,
and the Apostles in the new, did worke
miracles. I answer, they did so, but how?
not by their owne power, but by the
power of God, beeing onely his instruments,
whom he vsed for some speciall
purpose in those works: and such as did
not themselues cause the miracle, but

God in and by them. The same doth Peter
and Iohn acknowledge, when they
had restored the lame man to the perfect
vse of his limmes, that by their power
and godlinesse, they had not made the man to
goe, Act. 3. 13.
                  Againe, it is obiected, that our Sauiour
Christ in his manhood wrought
many miracles, as those before mentioned,
and many more. Ans. Christ as he
was man did something in the working
of miracles, but not all. For in euery miraculous
worke there be two things, the

                     e, and the acting or dispensing
of the work: the work it selfe, being
for nature and substance miraculous,
considering it was aboue or against the
order of natural causes, did not proceed

                        •
                     rom Christ as man, but from him as
God; but the dispensation of the same,
in this or that visible manner
                        •
                      to the
viewe of men, was done and performed
by his manhood. For example; The raising
vp of Lazarus out of the graue, hauing
beene dead foure daies, was a miracle
                        •
                     
to the effecting whereof, both the
Godhead & the manhood of Christ 
                        •
                     ō
                     curred,

by their seueral & distinct actiōs.
The manhood onely vttered the voice,
and bad Lazarus come forth, but it was
the godhead of Christ that fetched his
soule from heauen, and put it againe into
his bodie, yea, which gaue life and
power to Lazarus, to heare the voice vttered,
to rise and come forth. Ioh. 11.
43. In like manner, when he gaue sight
to the blinde, Matth. 20. 34. he touched
their eyes with the hands of his manhood,
but the power of opening them,
and making them to see, came from his
Godhead, whereby he was able to doe
all things. And in all other miraculous
workes which he did, the miracle was
alwaies wrought by his diuine power
onely; the outward actions and circumstances
that accompanied the same, proceeded
from him as he was man.
                  Now, if Christ as he is man, cannot
worke a true miracle, then no meere
creature can doe it, no not the Angels
themselues, and consequently not Satan,
it beeing a meere supernaturall
worke, performed onely by the omnipotent
power of God.
                  
                     
§ 2. The second sort of wonders, are
lying and deceitfull, which also are extraordinarie
workes in regard of man,
because they proceed not from the vsuall
and ordinarie course of nature: and
yet they be no miracles, because they
are done by the vertue of nature, and
not aboue or against nature simply, but
aboue and against the ordinarie course
thereof: and these are properly such
wonders, as are done by Satan and his
instruments; examples whereof wee
shall see afterwards.
                  If any man in reason thinke it not
likely, that a creature should be able
to worke extraordinarily by naturall
means, he must remember, that though
God hath reserued to himselfe alone the
power of abolishing and changing nature,
the order whereof he set and established
in the creation, yet the alteration
of the ordinarie course of nature, he
hath put in the power of his strongest
creatures, Angels and deuills. That the
Angels haue receiued this power, and
doe execute the same vpon his command
or permission, it is manifest by

Scripture, and the proofe of it is not so
necessarie in this place. But that Satan
is able to doe extraordinarie workes by
the helpe of nature (which is the question
in hand) it shall appeare, if we
consider in him these things.
                  First, the Deuil is by nature a spirit, &
therfore of great vnderstanding, knowledge,
& capacitie in all naturall things,
of what sort, qualitie, & cōdition soeuer,
whether they be causes or effects, whether
of a simple or mixt nature. By reason
whereof he can search more deeply
& narrowly into the grounds of things,
then all corporall creatures that are clothed
with flesh and blood.
                  Secondly, he is an auncient spirit,
whose skil hath beene confirmed by experience
of the course of nature, for the
space almost of sixe thousand yeares.
Hence he hath attainted to the knowledge
of many secrets, and by long obseruation
of the effects, is able to discern
and iudge of hidden causes in nature,
which man in likelyhood cannot come
vnto by ordinarie meanes, for want of
that opportunitie both of vnderstāding

and experience. Hereupon it is, that
whereas in nature there be some properties,
causes, and effects, which man
neuer imagined to be; others, that men
did once know, but are now forgot;
some, which men knewe not, but might
know; and thousands which can hardly,
or not at all be known: all these are most
familiar vnto him, because in themselus
they be no wonders, but only misteries
and secrets, the vertue and effect whereof
he hath sometime obserued since his
creation.
                  Thirdly, he is a spirit of wonderfull
power and might, able to shake the
earth, and to confound the creatures inferiour
to him in nature and condition,
if he were not restrained by the omnipotent
power of God. And this power,
as it was great by his creation, so it is
not impayred by his fall, but rather increased
and made more forcible by his
irreconciliable malice he beareth to
mankind, specially the seede of the woman.
                  Fourthly, there is in the deuil an admirable
quicknes and agilitie, proceeding

from his spirituall nature, whereby
he can very speedily and in a short spoce
of time, conuay himselfe and other creatures
into places farre distant one from
another. By these 
                        •
                     ower helpes, Satan is
inabled to doe strange workes. Strange
I say to man, whose knowledge since
the fall is mingled with much ignorance,
euen in naturall things; whose experience
is of short continuance, and
much hindered by forgetfulnes; whose
agilitie by reason of his grosse nature, is
nothing, if he had not the helpe of other
creatures; whose power is but
weaknes and infirmity in comparison of
Satans.
                  
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      if their be any further doubt,
how Satan can by these helpes worke
wonders, we may be resolued of the
truth thereof by considering three other
things. First, that by reason of his
great knowledge and skill in nature he
is able to apply creature to creature, and
the causes efficient to the matter, and
therby bring things to passe, that are in
common conceit impossible.
                  Secondly, he hath power to mooue

them, not onely according to the ordinary
course, but with much more speed
and celeritie.
                  Thirdly, as he can apply and mooue,
so by his spirituall nature he is able, if
God permit, to conuey himselfe into
the substance of the creature, without
any penetration of dimensions: and
beeing in the creature, although it be
neuer so solide, he can worke therein,
not onely according to the principles
of the nature thereof, but as farre as the
strength and abilitie of those principles
will possibly reach and extend themselues.
Thus it appeareth, that the deuill
can in generall worke wonders.
                  § 3. Now more particularly, the
deuills wonders are of two sorts. Illusions,
or reall actions.
                  An illusion is a worke of Satan,
wherby he deludeth or deceiueth man.
And it is two-fold; either of the outward
senses, or of the minde. An illusion
of the outward senses,August de 
                           〈…〉
                        . c. 18. is a worke of the
deuil, wherby he makes a man to thinke
that he heareth, seeth, feeleth or toucheth
such things as indeede he doth not.

This the deuill can easily doe diuers
waies, euen by the strength of nature.
For example, by corrupting the instruments
of sense, as the humor of the eye,
&c. or by altering and changing the
ayre, which is the meanes whereby we
see, and such like.
                  Experience teacheth vs, that the deuill
is a skilfull practitioner in this kind,
though the means whereby he worketh
such feats, be vnknowne vnto vs. In this
manner Paul affirmeth that the Galatians
were deluded, whē he saith, O foolish
G
                           •
                        latians who hath bewitched you? Gal. 3. 1.
Where he vseth a word
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        
                      borrowed
from the practise of witches and sorcerers,
who vse to cast a miste (as it were)
before the eyes to dazle them, and make
things to appeare vnto them which indeede
they doe not see: and the ground
of Pauls comparison is that which hee
takes for a graunted truth, that there be
such delusions whereby mens senses are
and may be corrupted by Satanicall operation.
                  Thus againe the deuill by the Witch
of Endor deceiued Saul in the appearance

of Samuel, 
                        •
                     . Sam. 28. making him
beleeue that it had beene Samuel indeed,
whereas it was but a mere coun
                     
                        •
                     erfeit
of him, as shal appeare hereafter.
Againe, the deuill knowing the constitutions
of men, and the particular diseases
whereunto they are inclined, taks
the vantage of some, and secondeth the
nature of the disease by the cōcurrence
of his owne delusion, thereby corrupting
the imagination, and working
in the minde a strong perswasion, that
they are become, that which in truth
they are not. This is apparant in that
disease▪ which is tearmed Lycanthropia,
where some, hauing their brains possessed
and distempered with melancholy,
haue verily thought themselues to bee
wolues, and so behaued themselues.
And the Histories of men in former ages,
haue recorded strange testimonies
of some, that haue been thus turned into
wolues, lyons, dogges birds, and other
creatures, which could not be really
in substance, but onely in appearance,
and phantasie corrupted, and so
these records are true. For God in his

iust iudgement, may suffer some men
so to be bewitched by the deuill, that to
their conceit th
                        •
                     y may seeme to be like
these bruit beaste, though indeede they
remaine true 
                        〈◊〉
                      still. For it i
                        •
                      a worke
surmounting the deuills power, to
change the substance of any one creature,
into the substance of another. By
this kind of delusion the Church of
Rome, in the times of blindnesse and
ignorance, hath taken great aduantage,
and much encreased her riches and honour.
For there be three points of the
religion of that Church, to wi
                        ••
                     e, Rurgatorie,
Inuocation of 
                           〈◊〉
                         Saints, and honouring
of Reliques, whereby she hath notably
inriched her selfe, all which had their
first foundation from these and such like
Satanicall impostures. For the onely
way, whereby they haue brought the
common sort to yeeld vnto them, both
for beleefe and practise, hath beene
by deluding their outward sense
                        •
                     , with
false apparitions of ghosts and soules
of men, walking and ranging abroad after
their departure, and such like
                        •
                      wherby
simple persons, ignorant of their fetches

and delusions, haue beene much
affrighted, a
                        •
                     d caused thorough extremitie
of feare and dread, to purchase
their owne peace and securitie, by many
and great expenses. And indeede these
were the strongest arguments that euer
they had, and which most preuailed
with the common people, as is manifest
in stories of all nations and ages, where
such deceits haue taken place, though
oftentimes by the iust iudgement of
God, they were taken in their craft, and
their feat
                        •
                      reuealed.
                  The second kind of illusion, is of the
minde, whereby the deuill deceiues the
minde, and makes a man thinke that of
himselfe which is not true. Thus experience
teacheth, that he hath deluded
men both in former and latter times,
who haue auouched and professed
themselues to be kings, or the sonnes of
Kings. Yea, some haue holden themselues
to be Christ, some to be Elias,
some to be Iohn the Baptist, and some
extraordinarie Prophets. And the like
concei
                        •
                     s haue entred into the minds of
sundrie Witches, by the suggestion and

perswasion of the deuill. To whome,
when they haue wholly resigned their
soules and bodies, they haue beene
mooued to beleeue things impossible
touching themselues, as that they haue
indeed beene changed into other creatures,
as catts, birds, mise, &c. The inquisitions
of Spaine & other countries,
wherein these and such like things are
recorded touching Witches really metamorphosed
into such creatures, cannot
be true; considering that it is not in
the power of the deuill, thus to change
substāces into other substāces. And those
conuersions recorded by them, were
onely Satans illusions, wherewith the
mindes of Witches were possessed, and
nothing else; which though they were
extraordinarie, (as the rest of this kinde
are) yet they went not beyond the
power of nature.
                  The second sort of the deuills wonders,
are reall workes, that is, such as are
indeede that which they seeme and appeare
to be. These, howsoeuer to men
that knowe not the natures of things,
nor the secret and hidden causes thereof,

they may seeme very strange and admirable,
yet they are no true miracles,
because they are not aboue and beyond
the power of nature.
                  If it be here alleadged, that the deuils
workes are not reall and true actions,
because the holy Ghost calleth them
Lying wonders, 2. Thes. 2. 9. I answer, that
they are called Lying wonders, not in respect
of the workes themselues, for they
were workes truely done and effected;
but in regard of the deuills end and purpose
in working thē, which is to lie vnto
men, and by them to deceiue. The
truth of which point will appeare in the
viewe of some particular examples.
                  First▪ we read in the historie of Iob,Iob. 1. 16.
that Satan brought downe fire from
heauen, which burnt vp Iobs sheep and
seruants; and caused a mightie winde to
blowe downe the house vpon his children,
                        
                           •
                        er. 19.
as they were feasting, to destroy
them. Againe, he smot the bodie of Iob
with botches and boyles. All these were
true & reall works, very strange & admirable,
and yet no miracles, because they
exceeded not the compasse of nature.

For first, when he cast downe the fire
from heauen, he did not create the fire
of nothing, for that is a worke proper
to God alone, but applied creature to
creature, and therefore produced such
a matter as was fit to make fire of. If it be
demanded, how he is able to doe this?
we must remember, that his knowledge
in naturall causes is great, and
therefore he was not ignorant of the
materiall cause of fire, which beeing
throughly knowne and founde out,
Satan brought fire vnto it, and so putting
fire to the matter of fire, he brought
it downe by his power and agilitie from
heauen, vpon the cattell and seruants
of Iob. Againe, the winde which blewe
downe the house, where his sonnes and
daughters were eating and drinking,
was not created by the deuill, but he
knowing well the matter wherof winds
are generated naturally, added matter
to matter, and thence came the
winde; whereunto he ioynes himselfe,
beeing a spirit of a swift and speedie
nature, and so makes it, for his own purpose,
the more violent and forcible.

Thirdly, he smote Iobs bodie with sore
boyles, from the crowne of his head to
the sole of his foote. Now this may
seeme strange, that he should haue such
power ouer mans body, as to cause such
diseases to breed in it. Therefore we are
further to vnderstand, that his knowledge
extendeth it selfe to the whole
frame and disposition of mans bodie,
whereby it comes to passe, that the causes
of all diseases are well knowne vnto
him, and he is not ignorant ho
                        •
                     e the
humours in the bodie may be putrified,
and what corrupt humours will breede
such and such diseases, and by what
meanes the aire it selfe may be infected:
hereupon preparing his matter, and applying
cause to cause, he practised vpon
the bodie of Iob, and filled him with
grieuous sores.
                  Another example of Satans reall
workes is this. By reason of his great
power and skill, he is able to appeare in
the forme and shape of a man, and resemble
any person or creature, and that
not by deluding the senses, but by assuming
to himselfe a true body. His power

is not so large, as to create a bodie, or
bring againe a 
                        •
                     oule into a bodie, yet by
his dexteritie and skill in naturall causes
he can worke wonderfully. For he is able,
hauing gathered together fit matter,
to ioyne member to member, and
to make a true bodie, either after the
likenes of man, or some other creature;
and hauing so done, to enter into it, to
mooue and stirre it vp and downe, and
therein visibly and sensibly to appeare
vnto man; which though it be a strange
worke, and besides the ordinarie course
of nature, yet it is not simply aboue the
power thereof.
                  For a third instance. The deuill is able
to vtter a voice in plaine words and
speach, answerable to mans vnderstanding
in any language. Not that he can
take vnto himselfe beeing a spirit, an
immeadiate power to speake or frame a
voyce of nothing without meanes, but
knowing the naturall and proper causes
and meanes by which men doe speake,
by them he frames in himselfe the voyce
of a man, and plainely vtters the same
in a knowne language. In this manner

he abused the tongue and mouth of the
serpent, when in plaine words he tempted
Eue to eate the forbidden fruit.
Now it is to be remembred here, that
when the deuill speakes in a creature, it
must be such a creature, as hath the instruments
of speach, or such whereby
speach may be framed and vttered, not
otherwise: for it was neuer heard that
he spake in a stocke or a stone, or any
created entity, that had not the meanes
and power of vttering a voice, at least
in some sort; it beeing a worke peculiar
to the Creator, to giue power of vtterance
where it is not by creation. Againe,
when he frameth a voice in a
creature, he doth it not by giuing immediate
power to speake, for that he
cannot doe, and the creature abused by
him, remaineth in that regard, as it was
before. But it beeing naturally fitted and
disposed to vtter a voice, though not
perfectly to speake as a man, he furthereth
and helpeth nature in it, and addeth
to the facultie thereof a present vse
of words, by ordering and ruling the
instruments to his intended purposes.

And to conclude this point, looke what
strange workes and wonders may be
truely effected by the power of nature,
(though they be not ordinarily brought
to passe in the course of nature) those
the deuill can do, & so farre forth as the
power of nature will permit, he is able
to worke true wonders, though for a
false and euill ende.
                  Here a question is mooued by some,
whether the deuil can change one creature
into another, as a man or woman
into a beast? for some, notwithstanding
the doctrine alreadie taught, are of opinion,
that he can turne the bodies of
Witches into other creatures, as hares,
cattes, and such like. Ans. The transmuta
                        •
                     ion
of the substance of one creature
into another, as of a man into a beast
of what kind soeuer, is a worke simply
aboue the power of nature, and therefore
cannot be done by the deuil, or any
creature. For it is the proper worke of
God alone, as I haue said, to create, to
change or abolish nature.
                  It is obiected, that such chāges haue
beene made. For Lots wi
                        •
                     e was turned

into a pillar of salt, Gen. 19. 26. Ans. It is
true, but that was done by the mightie
power of God, neither can it be proued
that any creature, Angel, or other, was
euer able to doe the like.
                  But it is further said, that king Nabuchadnezzar
was turned in
                        •
                     o a beast, and
did eate grasse with the beasts of the
field, Dan. 4. 30. Ans. There is no such
matter: his substance was not changed,
so as his bodie became the bodie of a
beast indeede, but his condicions onely
were altered by the iudgement of God
vpon his minde, whereby he was so
farre forth bereaued of humane sense
and vnderstanding. Againe, for his behauiour
and kinde of life, he became
altogether bruitish for the time, and excepting
onely his outward forme and
shape, no part of humanitie could appeare
in him: but that he retained his
humane bodie still, it is euident by his
owne words, vers. 31. when he saith,
And mine vnderstanding was restored to
me: which argueth plainly, that the hand
of God was vpon him in some kind of
madnesse and furie, and therefore that

there was not a change of his bodie and
substance, but a strange and fearefull alteration
in his minde and outward behauiour.
And though such a transmutation
should be granted, yet it makes nothing
for the purpose, considering it
was the worke of God onely, and not
of the deull. And thus we see what kind
of wonders the deuil can bring to passe.
The meditation of which point may
teach vs tvvo things.
                  First that the working of wonders is
not a thing that will commend man vnto
God, for the deuill himselfe, a wicked
spirit, can worke them: And many shall
alledge this in the day of iudgement,
that they haue by the name of God cast
out deuils, and done many great wo

to whome notwithstanding the Lord
will say, I neuer knewe you; depart from me

                        quitie, Matth. 7. 22. 23.
It behooueth vs rather to get vnto our
selues the precious gifts of faith, repentance,
and the feare of God, yea to go
before others in a godly life and vpright
conuers
                        •
                     tion, then to excell in effecting
of strange workes. When the seauentie

Disciples came to our Sauiour Christ
with ioy, and tolde him, that euen the
deuills were subdued vnto them through
his name, Luk. 10. 17. he counsells them,
not to reioyce in this, that wicked
spirits were s
                        •
                     bdued vnto them, but rather,
because their names were written
in heauen, vers. 20.
                  Indeed to be able to worke a wonder,
is an excellent gift of God, and may
minister matter of reioycing, when it
proceedeth from God: but seeing the
deuill receiued this power by the gift of
creation, our speciall ioy must not be
therein, but rather in this, that we are
the adopted sonnes of God, in which
priuiledge the deuill hath no part with
vs. And therefore the Apostle, 1. Cor.
13. making a comparison of the gifts of
the spirit, as of speaking diuers tongues,
of prophecying, and working miracles
with loue; in the end, wisheth men to
labour for the best gifts, which are faith,
hope, and loue, because by these we are
made partakers of Christ, on whom we
ought to set our hearts, and in whome
we are commanded

                  Secondly, we learne from hence, not
to beleeue or receiue a doctrine now
or at any time, because it is confirmed
by wonders. For the deuill himselfe is
able to confirme his errours and Idolatrous
seruices by strange and extraordinarie
signes, by which vsually he laboureth
to auouch and verisie the grossest
points of falshood in matter of religion.
On the contrarie, we must not reiect or
contemne a doctrine, because it is not
thus confirmed. This was a maine fault
in the Iewes, who would not receiue
the word preached by Christ, vnlesse he
shewed them a signe from heauen. Indeed
in the primitiue Church it pleased
God to confirme that doctrine which
the Apostles taught, by great signes and
miracles, but now that gift is ceased,
and the Church hath no warrant to expect
any further euidence of the religion
it professeth and enioyeth by arguments
of that kinde; yea rather it hath
cause to suspect a doctrine taught for
the wonders sake, whereby men labour
to auouch it.
               
               
                  
                  Sect. V.
                  The last clause in the description,August. de Trin l. 3. c. 7. is
this; so farre forth as God in iustice suffereth:
which I adde, for two causes. First,

                        •
                     o shew that God, for iust causes, permi
                        •

                     h
the Arts of Magicke & Witchcraft,
and the practises thereof. Now
this he doth in his prouidence, either
for the triall of his children, or for the
punishment of the wicked.
                  First therefore God permits these
wicked Arts in the Church, to prooue
whether his children wil steadfastly beleeue
in him, and seeke vnto his word,
or cleaue vnto the deuill, by seeking to
his wicked instruments. This Moses
plainely forewarned the Church of
God of, in his time, Deuter. 13. v. 1. If
there arise among you a Prophet, or a dreamer
of dreames, and giue thee a signe or
wonder, v. 2. and the signe and wonder which
he hath told thee, come to passe, saying, Let
vs goe after other gods, which thou hast not
knowne, and serue them, v. 3. thou shalt not
hearken to the words of that Prophet, &c.
                  
                  Againe, God suffereth them for the

punishment of vnbeleeuers and wicked
men: for oftentimes God punisheth one
sinne by an other, as the antecedent
sinnes by the consequent. This Paul
plainely sheweth (speaking of the daies
of Antichrist) that because men receiued
not the loue of the truth,
                     2. Thess. 2. 10, 11. 
                     therefore God would
send vpon them strong illusions, that they
should beleeue lies. And we may resolue
our selues, that for this very cause, God
suffereth the practises of Witchcraft, to
be so rise in these our daies, to punish
the ingratitude of men, who haue the
truth reuealed vnto them, and yet will
not beleeue and obey the same, but
tread it vnder their feete,
                        
                           •
                         12. 
                     that all they
might be condemned which beleeued not the
truth, but tooke pleasure in vnrighteousnesse.
                  
                  Secondly, this last clause is added, to
shewe that in the practises of sorcerie
and witchcraft, the Deuill can doe so
much onely as God permitts him, and
no more. Doubtlesse, his malice reacheth
further, and consequently his will
and desire; but God hath restrained his
power, in the execution of his malitious

poses, whereupon he cannot goe a whit
further, then God giues him leaue and
libertie to goe. The Magicians of Egypt
did some wonders in shew like vnto
the miracles wrought by Moses and
Aaron, and that for a time, by changing
a rodde into a serpent, and water into
blood, and by bringing froggs through
he sleight and power of the deuill; but
when it pleased God, to determine their
practises, and giue them no further liber

in likelihood was the meanest of all the
rest, the turning of the dust of the land
into lice, and themselues gaue the true
reason thereof,

but of God, whose instrument he was;

                     aiah, The Lord-hath put a lying spirit
in the mouth of all these thy Prophets, and
the Lord hath appointed euill against thee,
v. 23. Hence also it was, that the deuills,
beeing cast out of the man that had an
vncleane spirit, asked leaue of Christ to
enter into the heard of swine, and could
not enter in till he had permited them;
Mark. 5. 12, 13. And we read oftentimes
in the Gospel, that our Sauiour cast out
many deuills by his word onely, thereby
shewing that he was absolute Lord
ouer them, and that without his permission;
they could doe nothing.
                  And thus much touching the generall

                        〈◊〉
                      of this Art.
               
            
            
               CHAP. II.
               The Ground of Witchcraft,
and of all the practises thereof.
               
                  THe Ground of all the
practises of Witchcraft,
is a league or couenant
made betweene the
Witch and the Deuill:
wherein they doe mutually

bind themselues each to other. If
any shall thinke it strange, that man or
woman should enter league with Satan,
their vtter enemie; they are to know it
for a most euident and certen truth, that
may not be called into question. And
yet to cleare the iudgement of any one
in this point, I will set downe some reasons
in way of proofe.
               First, the holy Scripture doth intimate
so much vnto vs in the 58. Psal. v. 5.
where, howsoeuer the cōmon translation
runneth in other tearmes, yet the
words are properly to be read thus;
which heareth not the voyce of the mutterer
ioyning societies cunningly. And in them
the Psalmist layeth downe two points.
First, the effect or worke of a charme,
muttered by the Inchanter; namely, that
it is able to stay the Adder from s
                     •
                  inging
those which shall lay hold on him,
or touch him. Secondly, the maine
foundation of the charme; societies or
confederacies cunningly made, not betweene
man and man, but (as the words
import) betweene the Inchanter and
the deuill. The like we read, Deuter. 18.

11. where the Lord chargeth his people
when they come into the land of Canaan,
that amongst other abominations
of the heathen, they should beware least
any were found amongst them, that
ioyned societie, that is, entred into
league and compact with wicked spirits.
               A second reason may be this: it is the
practise of the deuill to offer to make a
bargaine and couenant with man. Thus
he dealt with our Sauiour Christ,Math. 4. 9. in the
third temptation wherewith he assaulted
him, promising to giue vnto him
all the kingdomes of the earth, and the
glorie of them, (which he shewed him
in a vision) if Christ for his part would
fall downe and worshippe him. The offer
was passed on the behalfe of Satan,
and now to make a perfect compact betweene
them, there was nothing wanting
but the free consent of our Sauiour
vnto the cōdition propounded. Whereby
it is manifest, that the Deuill makes
many couenants in the world, because
he findeth men and women in the most
places, fitted for his turne in this kind,

who will not let to worship him for a
farre lesse matter then a kingdome. And
it is not to be doubted, that thousands in
the world, had they been offered so faire
as Christ was, would haue beene as
willing to haue yeelded vpon such
conditions, as the Deuill to haue offered.
               Thirdly, the common confession of
all Witches and So
                     •
                  cerers, both before
and since the comming of Christ, doth
yet more fully confirme the same. For
they haue confessed with one consent,
that the very ground-worke of all their
practises in this wicked art, is their
league with the deuill. And hence it appeareth,
how and whereupon it is, that
Sorcerers and Witches can bring to
passe strange things by the helpe of Satan;
which other men ordinarily can
not doe; namely, because they haue entred
a league with him, whereby he
hath bound himselfe to them, for the
effecting of rare and extraordinarie
workes, which others, not ioyned with
him in the like confederacie, are not
able either by his helpe, or any power

or policie of their owne to bring to
passe. Hereupon it was, that the Witch
of Endor shewed vnto Saul the appearance
of Samuel, which neither Saul
himselfe, nor any in all his court could
doe. There was no great vertue in the
matter or frame of her words, for shee
was ignorant and had no learning. By
power she could not effect it, beeing a
weake woman; neither was it like that
she had more cunning and pollicie then
any of the learned Iewes in those times
had for such purposes. The main reason
was, her league made with Satan, by
vertue whereof shee commanded him
to appeare in the likenes of Samuel,
which neither Saul nor any of his companie
could doe, by vertue of such couenant,
which they had not made.
               The ende why the Deuill seeketh to
make a league with men, may be this; It
is a point of his policie, not to be readie
at euery mans command to doe for him
what he would, except he be sure of his
reward; and no other meanes will serue
his turne for taking assurance hereof,
but this couenant. And why so? that

hereby he may testifie both his hatred
of God, and his malice against man.
For since the time that he was cast
down from heauen, he hath hated God
& his kingdome, and greatly maligned
the happy estate of man, especially since
the couenant of grace made with ou
                     •
                  
first parents in Paradise. For he thought
to hau
                     •
                   brought vpon them by their
fall, eternall and finall confusion, but
perceiuing the contrarie by vertue of
the couenant of grace; then manifested,
and seeing m
                     •
                  n by it to be in a better
and surer estate then before, he much
more maligned his estate, and beares
the ranker hatred vnto God for that his
mercie bestowed vpon him.
               Now that he might shew forth this
hatred and malice, he takes vpon him
to imitate God, and to counterfeit his
dealings with his Church. As God
therefore hath made a couenant with
his people, so Satan ioynes in league
with the world, labouring to bind some
men vnto him, that so if it were possible,
he might drawe them from the couenant
of God, and disgrace the same. Againe,

as God hath his word and Sacraments,
the seales of his couenant vnto
beleeuers; so the deuill hath his words
and certaine outward signes to ratifie
the same to his instruments, as namely,
his figures, characters, gestures, and
other Satanicall ceremonies, for the
confirmation of the truth of his league
vnto them. Yea further, as God in his
couenant, requires saith of vs to the beleeuing
of his promises: so the deuill in
his compact, requires faith of his vassalls,
to put their affiance in him, and relie
on him for the doing of whatsoeuer
he bindes himselfe to doe. Lastly, as
God heares them that call vpon him
according to his will: so is Satan readie
at hand vpon the premisses, endeauouring
to the vtmost of his power, (when
God permits him) to bring to passe
whatsoeuer he hath promised. And so
much of the league in generall.
               More particularly, the league betweene
the Deuill and a Witch, is twofold:
either expressed and open, or secret
and close.
               The expresse and manifest compact

is so tearmed, because it is made by solemne
words on both parties. And it is
not so expressely set downe in Scriptures,
as in the writings of learned men,
which haue recorded the confessions of
Witches, and they expresse it in this
manner. First, the Witch for his part, as
a slaue of the deuill, binds himselfe vnto
him by solemne vowe and promise to
renounce the true God, his holy word,
the couenant he made in Baptisme, and
his redemption by Christ; & withall to
beleeue in the deuil, to expect & receiue
aide and helpe from him, and at the end
of his life, to giue him either bodie, or
soule, or both: & for the ratifying hereof,
he giues to the deuil for the present,
either his owne hand-writing, or some
part of his blood, as a pledge & earnest
pennie to bind the bargaine. The deuill
on the other side, for his part promiseth
to be readie at his vassalls command, to
appeare at any time in the likenesse of
any creature, to consult with him, to
aide and helpe him in any thing he shall
take in hand, for the procuring of pleasures,
honour, wealth, or preferment,

to goe for him, to carrie him wheth
                     •
                  r
he will, in a word, to doe for him,
whatsoeuer he shall commande. Many
sufficient testimonies might he alleadged
for the proofe hereof, but it is so
manifest in daily experience, that it
cannot well bee called into question.
               But yet if it seeme strange vnto any,
that there should be such persons in the
world, that make such fearefull couenāts
with the deuill, let them consider but
this one thing, and it will put them out
of doubt.
               The nature of man is exceeding impatient
in crosses, and outward afflictions
are so tedious vnto mortall minds,
and presse them with such a measure of
griefe, that some could be contented
with all their hearts to be out of the
world, if thereby they may be released
of such extremitie, and hereupon they
care not what meanes they vse, what
conditions they vndertake to ease and
helpe themselues. The deuill finding
men in these perplexities, is ready to
take his advantage, and therefore perceiuing

them now fitted for his purpose
to worke vpon; he insinuates and offers
himselfe, to procure them ease and deliuerance,
if they will vse such meanes, as
he shall prescribe for that purpose: and
to a naturall man there is no greater
meane then this to make him ioyne societie
with the deuill. He therefore,
without any further doubting or deliberation,
condescendes to Satan, so as
he may be based and releeued in these
miseries.
               Againe, we are to consider, that in
these cases, the deuil getteth the greater
hold of man, and mooues him to yeeld
vnto his suggestions the rather, because
that which he promiseth to doe for him
is present and at his command, and
therefore certaine; whereas the thing to
be performed on the behalfe of the partie
himselfe, as the giuing of bodie and
soule, &c. is to come sundry yeares after,
and therefore in regard of the particular
time, vncertaine. Now the naturall
man not regarding his future and finall
estate, preferres the present commoditie
before the losse and punishment that

is to come a farre off, and thereby is
perswaded to yeeld himselfe vnto Satan.
And by these and such like antecedents
are many brought to make open
league with the deuill.
               The secret and close league between
the Witch and Satan is that, w
                     •
                  erein
they mutually giue consent each to other,
but yet without a sworne couenant
conceiued in expresse words and conference.
Of this there be two degrees.
First, whē a mā vseth superstitions 
                     〈◊〉
                  
of prayer, wherein he expressely requireth
the helpe of the deuill, without any
mention of sol
                     •
                  mine words or couenant
going before. That this is a kind of compact
it is plaine, because herein there is a mutuall vnder-hand consent between
the partie and the deuill, though it be
not manifest. For when a 
                     〈…〉
                  
to vse supersti
                     •
                  ous formes of inuocation,
for helpe in time of need; by the
very vsing of them, His heart consenteth
to Satan, and he would gladly haue the
thing effected. When therefore the deuill
hath notice of them, and endeauo
                     •••
                  
to effect the thing prayed for,

therein also he giues consent; so as
though there be no expresse words of
compact outwardly framed on both
parts, yet the concurrence of a mutuall
consent for the bringing to passe of the
same things, makes the couenant authentical.
For according to the receiued
rules of equitie and reason; mutuall consent
of partie with partie, is sufficient to
make a bargaine, though there be no
solemne course or forme of words to
manifest the same to others.
               The second degree is, when a man vseth
superstitious meanes to bring any
thing to passe, which in his owne knowledge,
haue no such vertue in thēselues
to effect it, without the especiall operation
of the Deuill.
               Superstitious meanes I call all those,
which neither by order of creation, nor
by the special appointment and blessing
of God since, haue any vertue in them,
to bring to passe that thing for which
they are vsed. For example; A charme,
consisting of set words and syllables,
both rude, barbarous, and vnknowne, vsed
for the curing of some disease or

paine, is a superstitious meanes; because
it hath no vertue in it selfe to cure, either
by the gift of God in the creation,
or by any speciall appointment afterward
in his word, or otherwise. And
therefore when this meane is vsed by
man, which he knoweth hath no such
vertue in it, for the effecting of that
worke for which it was vsed, there is a
secret league made with the Deuill.
               Yet here I adde this clause, in his owne
knowledge, to put a difference betweene
men, which vse superstitious meanes to
bring some things to passe: For some
there be, which when they vse them,
know they be meerely superstitious, yea
weake and impotent, hauing no vertue
in themselues for the purpose whereto
they are vsed; as the repeating of certain
forms of words; the vsing of signes, characters,
and figures, which in effect are
meere charms, no whit effectuall in thē
                  selues,
but so farre forth as they serue
for watchwords vnto Satan, without
whose ayde nothing is done by them. A
plaine argument that the vser hereof
hath in his heart secretly indented with

Satan, for the accomplishment of his intended
workes. A second sort there is,
which vseth them for some speciall end,
beeing perswaded that there is vertue
in the meanes themselues to bring the
thing to passe, and yet not knowing that
either they be superstitious, or haue
their efficacie by the power and worke
of the deuill. Such persons haue made
as yet no league with Satan, but they
are in the high vvay thereunto. And
this course is a fit preparation to cause
them to ioyne vvith him in couenant. I
shew it by an example. A man is fallen
into some extemitie, and findes himselfe
bewitched; his paine is great, and
he desires with all his heart to be cured
and deliuered. Hereupon he sendeth for
the suspected Witch; beeing come, he
offers to scratch him or her, thinking by
this means to be cured of the witchcraft.
His reason is no other, then a strong
persvvasion, that there is simply vertue
in his scratching to cure him, and discouer
the Witch, not once suspecting that
the helpe commeth by the power of the
Deuill, but from the action it selfe. This

doing, he may be healed: but the truth
is, he sinneth and breakes Gods commandement.
For the vsing of these
meanes is plaine Witchcraft, as aftervvard
vve shall see. And yet for all this,
the partie cannot be saide in present to
haue made a league vvith Satan, because
he thought, that though he yeelded to
the vse of superstitious meanes for his
curing, yet there had beene in the saide
meanes a vertue of h
                     •
                  ling, vvithout any
helpe or vvorke of the Deuill.

               Of the kinds of Witchcraft,

                  WItchcraft is of tvvo
sorts; Divining, or
Working. For the
whole nature of this
art, consisteth either
in matter of Diuination
and coniecture,
or in matter of practise. And in both

these it is to be remembred, that nothing
can be effected, vnlesse the partie
haue made a league with the Deuill, expresse
or secret, or at the least, a prepa
                  
                     •
                  ation
thereunto, by a false and erroneous
opinion of the meanes.
               
                  Sect. I.
                  Diuination is a part of Witchcraft,

assistance of the deuill.
                  If it be here demanded, how the deuill
beeing a creature, should be able to
manifest and bring to light things past,
or to foretell things to come; I answer,
first generally, that Satan in this particular
worke, transformes himselfe into

                     n Angel of light, & takes vpon him the
exercise of these things in an ambitious
(though false) imitation of diuine reuelations
and predictions, made and vsed
by God in the times of the Prophets
& Apostles. And this he doth (as much
is in him lieth) to obscure the glorie of
God, and to make himselfe great in the
opinion of ignorant and vnbeleeuing

persons. Againe, though Satan be but
a creature, yet there be sundrie waies
whereby he is able to diuine.
                  First, by the Scriptures of the Old &
New Testament, wherein are set downe
sundrie prophecies concerning things
to come. In the Old Testament are recorded
many prophecies concerning
the state of Gods Church, from the first
age of the world, till the comming of
Christ. In the New Testament likewise
are recorded others, touching the selfe
same thing, from the cōming of Christ
in the latter daies, to the ende of the
world. Now the deuill beeing acquainted
with the historie of the Bible, and
hauing attained vnto a greater light of
knowledge in the prophecies therein
cōtained, then any man hath; by stealing
diuinations out of them, he is able to
tell of many strange things, that may in
time fall out in the world, and answerably
may shew them ere they come to
passe.
                  For example: Alexander the great before
he made warre with Darius king of
Persia, consulted with the Oracle, that is,

with the deuill, touching the euent and
issue of his enterprise. The Oracle answered
him thus; Alexander shall be a Conquerour;
vpon the prediction of the
Oracle,P
                           ••
                        tarch. in vita Alex. 
                     Alexander wages warre with
Darius, and inuades Asia, and hauing
conquered him, translated the Empire
from Persia to Greece, according as the
Oracle had said. Now if question bee
made, how the deuill knewe the euent
of this warre, and consequently made it
knowne to Alexander? The answer is,
by the helpe of a prophecie in the Old
testament; for this thing was particularly
set downe before hand by the Prophet
Daniel, Dan. 11. 3. where he saith;
That a mightie King sh
                           •
                        ll stand vp, and shal
rule with great dominion, and doe according
to his pleasure, and this was Alexander
the great. Satan therefore knowing the
secret meaning of the Angels wordes
vnto Daniel, framed out of them a true
and direct answer, whereas he was not
able of himselfe to de
                        •
                     ine certainly of
the euent of things to come in particular.
                  The second meanes, whereby the

deuill is furnished for his purpose, is his
owne exquisite knowledge of all naturall
things; as of the influences of the
starres, the constitutions of men and other
creatures, the kinds, vertues, and
operations of plants, rootes, hearbs,
stones, &c. which knowledge of his,
goeth many degrees beyond the skill
of all men, yea euen of those that are
most excellent in this kind, as Philosophers,
and Physicians. No marueile
therefore, though out of his experience
in these and such like, he is able aforehand
to giue a likely gesse at the
issues and euents of things, which are to
him so manifestly apparent in their
causes.
                  A third helpe and furtherance in this
point, is his presence in the most places:
for some deuills are present at all assemblies
and meetings, and thereby are acquainted
with the consultations and
conferences both of Princes & people;
whereby knowing the drift and purpose
of mens minds, when the same is manifested
in their speaches and deliberations,
they are the fitter to foretell many

things, which men ordinarily cannot
doe. And hence it is apparent, how
Witches may know what is done in other
countries, and whether one nation
intends warre against an other, namely,
by Satans suggestion, who was present
at the consultation, and so knew it, and
reuealed it vnto them. But how then
comes it to passe, that the consultations
and actions of Gods Church and children,
are not disclosed to their enemies?
euen by the vnspeakeable mercie and
goodnesse of God, who though for speciall
causes sometimes, he suffers Satan
by this meanes to bring things to light,
yet he hath restrained this his libertie,
and subiected it vnto his owne will, so
as he keepes him out of such meetings,
or compels him to conceale; whereas
otherwise his malice is so great, tha
                        •
                     
not a word could be spoken, but it
should be carried abroad to the hurt &
disturbance both of Churches and common-wealths.
                  The fourth way, is by putting into
mens mindes wicked purposes and
couns
                        •
                     ls; for after the league once made

he laboureth with them by suggestions
and where God giues him 
                        〈◊〉
                     , he neuer
ceaseth perswading, till he hath
brought his enterprise to passe. Hauing
therefore: first brought into the minde
of man, a resolution to doe some euill,
he goes and reueales it to the Witch,
and by force of perswasion vpon the
partie tempted, he frames the action intended
to the time foretold, and so finally
deludes the Witch his owne instrument,
foretelling nothing, but what
himselfe hath compassed and set about.
                  The fift helpe, is the agilitie of Satans
nature, whereby he is able speedily
to conuay himselfe from place to place,
yea to passe through the whole world
in a short 
                        •
                     ime. For God hath made him
by nature a spirit, who by the gift of his
creation, hath attained the benefit of
swiftnes, not onely in dispatching his
affairs, but also in the cariage of his person
with great expedition for the present
accomplishment of his owne desires.
                  Lastly, God doth often vse Satan as

his instrument, for the effecting of his
intended workes, and the executing of
his iudgements vpon men; and in those
cases manifesteth vnto him, the place
where, the time when, and the manner
how such a thing should be done. Now
all such things as God wil haue effected
by the deuill, he may fortell before
they come to passe, because he knowes
them before hand by reuelation and
assignment from God. Thus by the
Witch of Endor he foretolde to Saul
the time of his death and of his sonnes,
and the ruine of his kingdome,1. Sam. 28. 19. saying,
To morow shalt thou and thy sonnes be with
me, and the Lord shall giue the hoste of Israel
into the hands of the Philisti
                           •
                        s; which
particular euent, and circumstances appertaining,
he did truely define; not of
himselfe, but because God hath drawn
away his good spirit from Saul, and had
deliuered him to be guided by the deuill,
whome he also appointed as a
meanes; and vsed as an instrument to
worke his ouerthrowe. The Scripture
indeede maketh not particular mention
of the time of Sauls death, it onely recordeth

the manner thereof, and that
which followed vpon his death; the
translating of the kingdome to his
neighbour Dauid after him; and yet because
God vsed Satan as an instrument
to bring this to passe, hereupon he was
able to foretel the particular time, when
the will of God should be wrought vpon
him. And these be the ordinarie
meanes and helpes whereby the deuill
may knowe and declare strange
thinges, whether past, present, or to
come.
                  Neither may this seeme strange, that
Satan by such meanes should attaine
vnto such knowledge, for euen men by
their owne obseruations may giue probable
coniectures of the state and condition
of sundrie things to come. Thus
we read, that some by obseruation haue
found out probably, and foretold the
periods of famille
                        •
                      and kingdomes. For
example, that the time and continuance
of kingdomes is ordinarily determined
at 500. yeares, or not much aboue;
and that great families haue not gone
beyond the sixt and seauenth generation.

And as for speciall and priuate
things, the world so runnes (as it vvere)
in a circle, that if a man should but ordinarily
obserue the course of things,
either in the vveather, or in the bodies
of men, or othervvise, he might easily
foretell before hand vvhat would come
after. And by these and such like instances
of experiences, men haue gessed at
the alterations and changes of estates,
and things in particular. Novv if men
vvhich be but of short continuance, and
of a shallovv reach in comparison, are
able to doe such things, hovv much
more easily may the Deuill, hauing so
great a measure of knovvledge and experience,
and beeing of so long continuance,
hauing also marked the course
of all estates, be able to foretell many
things vvhich are to come to passe? specially
considering vvhat the wise man
hath set downe to this purpose, that that
which hath beene, shall be; and that which
hath beene done, shall be done; and there is no
new thing vnder the Sunne, Eccl. 1. 9.
                  If it be here alledged, that Diuination
is a prerogatiue of God himselfe, and a

part of his glorie incōmunicable to any
creature, Isa. 41. 23. I answer, Things to
come must be considered two waies; either
in themselues, or in their causes
and signes, which either go with them,
or before them. To foretell things to
come, as they are in themselues, without
respect vnto their signes or causes,
is a propertie belonging to God onely;
and the deuill doth it not by any direct
and immediate knowledge of things
simply considered in themselues, but
onely as they are present in their signes
or causes. Again, God foretelleth things
to come certainely, without the helpe
of any creature, or other meanes out of
himselfe; but the predictions of Satan
are onely probable and coniecturall: and
when he foretelleth any thing certainely,
it is by some reuelation from God,
as the death of Saul; or by the Scripture,
as Alexanders victory: or by some speciall
charge committed vnto him, for
the execution of Gods will vpon some
particular places or persons, as before
hath beene shewed.
                  Thus much for the causes of Diuination.

Now followe the parts and branches
thereof. Diuination is of two sorts;
either in and by meanes, or without
meanes. Diuination by meanes, is likewise
of two sorts; either by such as are
the true creatures of God; or those
which are meerly counterfeit & forged.
               
               
                  Sect. II.
                  Diuination by the true creatures of
God, is distinguished according to the
number of the creatures, into fiue distinct
kinds, whereof foure are mentioned
in the Scriptures.
                  § 1. The first, is by the flying and
noise of birds. Sorcerers among the
heathen, vsed to obserue foules in their
flight; for example, whether they did
flie on the right hand, or on the left; aboue
them, or below by them; whether
crosse and ouerthwart, or directly against
them. In like manner they obserued
the noise & sound of the foule. And
both these waies, sometimes by the
noyse, and sometimes by the flight, they
diuined of things to come, both publike
and priuate, of good and bad successe

in mans affaires; of the state of kingdomes,
townes, families and particular
persons. Now this kind of diuination is
condemned by Moses, Deut. 18. 10. Let
none be found among you that i
                           •
                         a—diuiner
of diuinations: that is, (as some intepret
it) a marker of the flying of foules: or a
charmer, or a consulter with spirits, or a
soothsayer; that is, such a one as by obseruing
the flying and noise of fowles,
takes vpon him to foretell good or bad
successe.
                  § 2. The second kind of creatures vsed
for diuinatiō, are the intralls of beasts,
of which mention is made Ezek. 21. 21.
where Nabuchadnezzar being to make
warre both with the Iewes and the
Ammonites, and doubting in the way
which enterprise to vndertake first, he
offers a sacrifice to the Idol gods, and
opening the bellie of the sacrifice, looks
vpon the liuer, and by the signes therein
found, he iudgeth what should be the
issue of the warre. Which thing Nabuchadnezzar
did according to the vsuall
practise of the Heathen, who when they
were to make warre, or to attempt any

businesse of importance, were wont to
offer sacrifice to their gods, and to prie
into the intralls of the beast sacrificed:
for example, the heart, stomake, splene,
kidneies, but specially the liuer, and by
certaine signes appearing in those
parts, the deuill was wont to reueale vnthem
what should be the successe of
their affaires they had in hand. It were
easie to exemplifie both these sorts of
Diuination by sundrie particulars out
of Heathen writers, but seeing the
Scripture hath manifested that there
are such, and experience shewes the
same, I will forbeare that labour, and
proceede.
                  But here it is demanded, why both
these kindes of Diuination should be
condemned in Scripture, considering
they had so great applause among the
Heathen?
                  I answer, because the flying of birds,
and the disposition of the inward parts
of creatures, are no true signes either of
good or bad successe. For that which is a
true signe of a future euent, must haue
the vertue and power whereby it signifieth,

from God himselfe, either by creation
in the beginning, or by his speciall
ordinance and appointment afterward.
Now it cannot be shewed, that God in
the creation infused any such vertue into
the natures and motions of these
creatures, whereby they might signifie
such things; neither is there any apparent
testimonie in the whole booke of
the Scriptures, whereby it may be proued,
that since the creation, they were
appointed by God, to serue such vses
and endes. And therefore howsoeuer
they were esteemed of the Heathen, yet
the word of God hath iustly censured
them, as no true and proper causes of
Diuination sanctified by God, but
meerely diabolicall.
                  It is alleadged, that Ioseph diuined
by his cuppe, as may appeare both by
his stewards speech, as also by his owne,
Gen. 44. 5. & 15. and yet that cuppe receiued
no power from God, either the
one way or the other, to be a cause or
meane of Diuination.
                  The answer anciently and commonly
made is this, that Iosephs steward

spake not as the thing was indeede, but
as the common receiued opinion was
among the Egyptians, who esteemed
Ioseph to be a man of great skill and
wisdome, able by sundrie meanes to diuine
and prophesie. To this I adde a second
answer, that the steward spake not
as he thought, but his purpose was in
those words, to cōceale the knowledge
of Ioseph his master from his brethren,
that thereby they might not discerne
who he was, but take him to be an Egyptian.
Thirdly, the words may not
vnfitly admit this interpretation, as if
the steward had said, Know ye not that
this cuppe which I finde in the sackes
mouth of your yongest brother, is that
whereby my master will easily prooue
what manner of men you are? this answer
is also auncient, and may well be
receiued.
                  It is further obiected, that our Sauiour
Christ by his speech vnto the Pharisies,
seemeth to approoue of Diuining
by creatures, as by winds, and by clouds;
When you see a cloud (saith he) rising out of
the West, straight way you say, a showre commeth,

and so it is: and when you see the South
wind blow, ye say, that it will be hoate, and it
commeth to passe, Luk. 12. 54, 55.
                  
                     Ans. There be some kinds of predictions
that are and may be lawfully vsed,
because they are naturall, of which
sort are those that are made by Physicians,
Mariners, and husbandmen, touching
the particular alterations and dispositions
of the weather; and these beeing
agreeable to that order which God
hath set in nature from the beginning;
by them a man may probably gather the
state of the weather, whether it will be
faire or foule; and of these naturall signs
our Sauiour Christ speaketh, not of diabolicall,
which haue no warrant, either
from the common course of nature created,
or by any speciall appointment
from God. So that whatsoeuer can be
said in their defence, this yet remaineth
certaine, that the slying and noise of
birds, and the state of the intralls of
beasts, are no true signes ordained by
God, but inuented by the deuill and his
instruments, and therefore all diuination
by them is iustly condemned, as wicked

and deuillish.
                  Whence it appeareth, what iudgement
may be giuen of those common
signes of Diuination, which are obserued
in the world, specially of the more
ignorant sort. For example: A man finds
a piece of yron, he presently conceiueth
a prediction of some good lucke vnto
himselfe that day. If he light on a peice
of siluer, then he stands contrarily affected,
imagining some euill will befall
him. Againe, when a man is taking his
iourney, if a hare crosse him in the way,
all is not well, his iourney shall not be
prosperous, it presageth some mischiefe
towards him. Let his cares tingle or
burne, he is perswaded he hath enemies
abroad, and that some man either then
doth, or presently will speake ill of him.
If the salt fall towards a man at the table,
it portendeth (in common conceit)
some ill newes. When a rauen stands
vpon some high place, looke what way
he turnes himselfe and cries, thence, as
some thinke, shall shortly come a dead
corps; albeit this sometime may be true
by reason of the sharpe sense of smelling

in the raven. These and sundrie other
of the like sort, are meerely superstitious.
For the truth is, they haue no
vertue in themselues to foreshewe any
thing that is to come, either in nature,
or by Gods ordinance. Therefore whatsoeuer
diuination is made by them, must
needes be fetched from Satanicall illusion.
And though we cannot say they be
soothsayings, or tearme the vsers and
fauourers of them soothsayers, yet we
may safely referre them to this kinde of
diuining, beeing such as no Christian
may warrantably vse, though some of
them be not so grosse and palpable, as
those that are condemned in the Scriptures.
                  § 3. The third kind of creatures vsed
to diuine by, are the starres. Diuination
by starres, 
                        •
                     s commonly called Iudiical
Astrologie; of which we may read, Deu.
18. 10. 11. where the holy Ghost doth
of purpose reckon vp all those kinds of
deuillish arts, whereby men haue dealings
and societie with Satan, either in
divining or practising▪
                      among which,
this is the second.
                  
                     
The word there vsed
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        . may carrie a
double sense. For it signifieth either him
that obserueth times, vnder which acception
Astrologie is comprehended, or
him that obserueth the clouds. And
howsoeuer the best learned Interpreters
doe dissent about the notation of
it, yet all agree in this, that this profession
of Diuining by the starres, is there
condemned: and that it is to be numbred
among the rest expressed in the
prohibition, may further appeare by other
places of Scripture, as in Isa. 47. 13.
14. where the Lord threatneth the same
iudgements against Diuiners by the
starre
                        •
                     , that he doth against Soothsaiers
and Magicians. Againe, in Dan. 2. 2. Inchaunters,
Astrologians, and Sorcerers
are ioyned together, as beeing all sent
for about the same busines, v
                           •
                        z. to expound
the Kings dreame. Nowe if the
Lord himselfe haue allotted the same
punishment to the Astrologer, which
he hath to the Soothsaier & Magician,
and account them all one; it is manifest,
that Diuining by the starres ought to
be held as a superstitious kind of Diuination.
                  
                     
Here if it be thought strange, that
predictions by so excellent creatures as
the starres be, should carrie both the
name and nature of diabolicall practises,
which can be done by none but such
as are in league with Satan:
                  I answer, The reasons hereof are
these:
                  First, it must be considered, that the
drift and scope of this art, is to foretell
the particular euents of things contingent,
as the alteration of the states of
kingdomes, the deaths of Princes, good
or badde successe of mens particular affaires,
from the houre of their birth, to
the day of their death. And from this
all men may iudge, what the art it selfe
is. For the foretelling of things to
come, which in their owne nature are
contingent, and in regard of vs casuall (I
say not in regard of God, to whome all
things are certenly knowne) is a propertie
peculiar to God alone, and not within
the power of any creature, man, or
Angel. A point that is plainely taught
by the Prophet Esai, from the 4. chap. of

his prophesie, to the 48. The scope
whereof is to prooue, that it is a prerogatiue
appointed to the Deitie, and not
communicable to the creature, to foreshew
the euēt of things to come, which
in our vnderstanding and reach, may either
be, or▪ not be; and which when they
are, may be thus or otherwaies. It remaines
therefore, that Diuinations of
this kind, taking from God his right,
and robbing him of his honour, are iustly
censured of impietie, & are in themselues
wicked and abominable.
                  It is alleadged, that starres in the
heauens, are the causes of many things
happening in the world, and therefore
to practise by them in this manner, deserueth
no such imputation.
                  
                     Ans▪
                      It cannot be denied that they
are causes of some things, but I demand,
what causes? not particular of particular
euents
                        •
                      but generall and common, that
worke alike vpon all things: and no man
can diuine of a particular euent, by a
generall cause, vnlesse he also know the
particular causes subordinate to the
generall, and the particular dispositions

and operations of them. For example,
let twentie or thirtie egges of sundrie
kinds of birds be taken, and set vnder
one and the same henne to be hatched;
it is not possible for any man, onely vpon
the bare consideration of the heate
of the hen, which is the generall cause
of hatching the egges, to set downe
certainely what kind of bird each egge
will bring forth, vnlesse he know what
the egges were particularly. For a generall
and common cause, doth not immediately
produce a particular effect,
but onely mooueth and helpeth the
particular, immediate, and subordinate
causes. Therefore the heat of the henne
doth not make one egge to send forth a
henne-chicken, another egge a ducke, a
third a swanne, &c. but onely helpeth it
forward by sitting and crouching vpon
them. In like manner the starres are generall
causes of naturall things, as the
heat of the hen is of the hatching of the
egges, and by them no man can rightly
define of particular euents, and therefore
Diuination by the slarres, whereby
are fore-told particular contingent euents,

in kingdomes, families, or particular
persons, is but a forged skill, that
hath no ground in nature from the vertue
of the starres, for any such purpose.
                  A second reason may be this; All the
rules and precepts of Astrologie, set
downe by the most learned among the
Chaldeans, Egyptians, and other Astrologers,
are nothing els but meer dotages
and fictions of the braine of man:
for the rules and conclusions of all good
and lawfull arts, haue their ground in
experience, and are framed by obseruation,
whereupon they are called Axioms,
or positions of arte, so generally and vndoubtedly
true, that they can not deceiue:
But these rules are of a contrarie
nature, hauing no foundation in experience
at all; for if they had, this must
needes follow, that the position of the
heauens, and the course of all the stars,
must needs continue one and the same;
for the principles of art ought to be immutable:
but neither the position of the
heauens, nor the course of all the starrs,
is alway one and the same. Againe, he

that would make sound rules of art by
obseruation, must know the particular
estate of all things he obserueth: But no
man knoweth the particular estate of all
the starres, and consequently none can
gather sound rules of arte by them.
Thirdly, no man knoweth or seeth all
the starres, and though they might be
all discerned, yet the particular vertues
of those which are seene, can not be
knowne, because their influences in the
aire, and vpon the earth, are confused;
and therefore by obseruation of them,
no rules can be made, whereby to iudge
of particular euents to come that be
contingent.
                  But experience teacheth (may some
say) that if a man addicted to this course
shall practise the rules of Astrologie,
it will fall out that the most things he
foretelleth shall be true, and come to
passe accordingly: which beeing verified
in experience, it should seeme, that
these principles are not vncerten: for
how is it possible that vpō false grounds,
should proceede true predictions? To
this obiection, learned Diuines haue

framed answer thus. That in this there
is a secret Magicke at the least, if not an
open league with Satan. For looke what
is wanting to the effect of the starrs, the
Deuill maketh supply of it by his owne
knowledge in things that are to come
to passe. And this is the iudgement of
them that haue knowne this arte, which
was also receiued for true in the daies of
the Apostles.
                  The third reason. The man that repaireth
to the Astrologian vpō the particular
case for his helpe and counsell,
must beleeue that he can and will doe
for him; otherwise, if he come doubting
of his ability, or in way of tempting
him, he can not helpe him. Now in
common vnderstanding, if the Diuiner
brings the thing to passe, here must
needes be more then Arte. For he that
is master of a lawfull arte, can worke by
his rules, whether a man beleeue that
he can or no; yea though all the men
in the world should doubt, his rules
would be effectuall. The arte therefore
it selfe is the old superstitious arte of the
Chaldeans, which they beeing Idolaters,

first ferched from the deuill, and his
Oracles: yea, the practise thereof is nothing
but superstitious sorcerie, and the
vndertakers no better then Sorcerers.
If any man doubt hereof, their writings
are sufficient testimonies, and they thē
                     selues
auouch it. For it is a rule and
maxime among them in all kind o
                        •
                      Sorcerie,
that the learner must come credulous,
and not doubting, or to tempt; otherwise
no answer can be giuen.
                  But notwithstanding all these reasons
alleadged for the proofe of this
point, sundrie things are opposed to the
contrarie.
                  For first, it is saide that the Sunne,
Moone, and Starres were created for
signes, Gen. 1. 14. and therefore that it is
lawfull to diuine by them, seeing that in
so doing, we doe but vse them to the
ende for which God made them.
                  
                     Ans. The reason is of no force. The
starres indeede by this ordinance doe
serue for signes, but of what? not of all
things, but (as the text plainly sheweth)
of daies, weekes, months, and yeare
                        •
                     ;
yea, of the seasons of the yeare; as of

Spring, Summer, Autumne, and Winter;
yea further, of the alterations of the
weather in generall; but all this maketh
nothing to ratifie Diuination of particular
euents in things cōtingent, which
are to fal out in the state of kingdomes,
families, and persons: for they are not
causes, but Signes, and that of some generall
things onely, not of particular.
                  Againe, it is said, that Moses & Daniel,
two famous Prophets, are commended
for their skill in this art: for of
Moses it is saide, Act. 7. 22. that he was
learned in all the wisedome of the Egyptians:
and Daniel, in all the wisdome of the Chaldeans,
Dan. 1. 17. 20. and we know, that
the Egyptians and Chaldeans were the
masters of Diuination, and eminent aboue
all others in matter of Astrologie.
                  
                     Ans. 1. It cannot be prooued out of
those places, that Moses or Daniel were
trained vp in this art: and though it
should be granted they were, yet it follows
not, that they were practisers of it.
at least continually. For albeit, beeing
children and of tender yeares in the
courts of Pharaoh and Nebuchadnetsar,

they had beene trained vp by their
gouernours in this knowledge, it may
not thence be concluded, that they finally
submitted themselues to the practise
thereof; considering that a man
may learne that when he is yong, which
afterward vpon better iudgement and
consideration, he may vtterly disclame.
And so we are to thinke of them, that
after God had called them, they did for
euer lay aside all such wicked and deuillish
practises, forbidden by God, and yet
in vse among the Egyptians and Chaldeans.
                  Thirdly, it is obiected; the starres are
admirable creatures of God, and the
causes of many straunge effects in the
aire, in the waters, and vpon the earth
also, in bodies of men and beasts: it
may seeme therefore not vnlawfull to
diuine by them.
                  
                     Ans. We graunt that the S
                        •
                     arres,
and especially the Sunne and Moone,
haue great vertue and force vpon the
creatures that are below; partly by their
light, and partly by their heat; but hence
it will not follow, that they are, or may

be lawfully vsed for Diuination: for
whereas it hath beene shewed, that the
grounds of all good arts are gathered
by obseruation and experience, it is not
possible for any man, truly and certenly,
to obserue all particular euents brought
forth by the starres, whereupon hee
might ground his rules. And for proofe
hereof; Suppose there were a heape of
all kinds of hearbs growing vpon the
earth gathered together, which should
be all strained into one vessell, and the
liquour brought to the most skilfull
Physitian that is, or euer was; can we
thinke him able by tasting or smelling
thereof, to distinguish the vertues of
the hearbs, and to say which is which?
To doe this when all were seuered each
from other, is a hard matter, yet possible,
considering they haue their seuerall
natures and operations: but in this confused
mixture to discerne the seueralls,
is a thing passing the skill of man.
                  The like may be said of the particular
vertue of euery star; for they all haue
their operation in the bodies of men,
and other creatures; but their vertues

beeing all mixed together in the subiect
whereon they worke, can no more be
knowne distinctly, then the vertues of a
masse of hearbs of infinite sorts beaten
together. For this is an vndoubted truth
in nature: that the vertues of Celestiall
bodies in their operations, are mingled
with the qualities of the elements in the
inferiour bodies, & the vertues of them
all doe so concurre, that neither the
heate or light of the starres, nor the vertue
of 
                        •
                     he elements, can be seuered one
from another. And therefore though
there be notable vertue in the starres,
vet in regard of the mixture thereof
in their operation, no man is able to
say by obseruation, that this is the vertue
of this starre, and this of that. The
seauen Planets beeing more notable,
then the other lights of the heauen, specially
the Sunne and the Moone, haue
their operations and effects plainely
and perfectly knowne: as for the other,
there was neuer any man that could either
feele their heate, or certenly determine
of any thing by them.
                  There being th
                        •
                      some stars, whose vertues

are vnknowne, how can their operations
and effects be discerned in particular?
Therefore no rules can be made
by obseruation of the vertues of the
starres in their operations, whereupon
we may foretell particular euents of
things contingent, either concerning
mens persons, families, or kingdomes.
                  A fourth reason. All starres haue their
worke in the qualities of heate, light,
cold, moisture, and drinesse, as for the
secret influences which men dreame of,
comming from them besides the saide
qualities, they are but forged fancies.
The Scripture neuer mentioneth any
such, neither can it be prooued, that the
Sunne hath any efficacie vpon inferiour
bodies, but by light and heate; which
because they are mixt with other qualiti
                        •
                     s,
they affo
                        •
                     rd no matter of prediction
touching particular euents. For

                        •
                     hat though the celestiall bodies doe

                        ••
                     use in the terrestriall, heate and cold,
drought and moisture? doth it therfore
follow, that these effects doe declare before
hand the constitution of mans bodie?

the disposition of mens minds? the
affections of mens hearts? or finally▪
what successe they shall haue in their affaires,
touching wealth, honour, and religion?
Hence I conclude, that diuining
by them in this sort, is meere superstition,
and a kinde of sorcerie: for which
cause in Scripture Astrologians are iustly
numbred among Sorcerers.
                  Now that which hath beene saide
touching this point, may serue for speciall
vse.
                  And first, it giues a caueat to all Students,
that they haue care to spend their
time and wits better, then in the studie
of Iudiciall Astrologie; and rather imploy
themselues in the searching out of
such things, as may most serue for the
glorie of God, and the good of his
Church. It is the subtiltie of Satan to
draw men into such meditations, and to
make this studie so pleasant, that it can
hardely be left, when it is once begun▪
but let them take heede betime. For assuredly
these vaine and superstitious
practises, are not the builders and furtherers,
but the hinderers and destroyers

of religion, and the feare of God.
                  Againe, this must admonish them
which suffer any losses, not to seeke for
helpe or remedie at the hands of Astrologers,
commonly called Figure casters,
for their directions in the recouerie of
thing
                        •
                      lost or stollen, commeth not by
the helpe of any lawfull art, but from
the worke of the deuill, reuealing the
same vnto them. And be
                        •
                     ter it were to
loose a thing finally, and by faith to expect
till God make supplie another way,
then in this manner to recouer it again:
yea, the curse of God hangeth ouer the
head of him, that to helpe himselfe vseth
diabolicall meanes. For put the case

                        〈◊〉
                      thing lost of great value, be againe restored
by the helpe of Satan: yet God in
his iustice, for the vse of these vnlawful
meanes, ma
                        •
                      take from the consulter
twice as much; or at least his grace, and
so giue him vnto a reprobate sense, to
beleeue the deuill to his vetter perdition.
                  Thirdly, it serueth to admonish vs of
some other vanities that accompanie
Astrologie▪ specially of two.
                  The first, is the obseruation of the signe
                     
in mans bodie; wherein not onely the
ignorant sort, but men of knowledge
doe far
                        •
                     e ouershoot themselues, superstitiously
holding, that the signe is specially
to be marked. An opinion in it
selfe fantasticall and vaine, not grounded
in nature, but borrowed from Astrologie.
For the Astrologians for better
expressing and establishing thereof,
haue deuised newe spheres in the heauens,
more then indeede there be, to
wit, the ninth and the tenth; and in the
tenth, commonly called the first mooueable,
haue placed an imaginarie sphere,
which they tearme the Zodiacke, and
in the Zodiack twelue signes, Aries,
Taurus, Gemini, and the rest, which they
imagine to haue power ouer the twelue
parts of mans bodie: as Aries, the head
and face, Taurus necke and throat, &c.
But these are onely twelue imaginarie
signes: for in the heauens there is no
such matter as a ramme, a bull, &c. And
how can it stand with reason, that in a
firmament fained by Poets and Philosophers,
a forged signe, which indeede
is nothing, should haue any power or

operation in the bodies of men?
                  Again, the very order of the gouernment
of these signes in mans bodie, is
fond and without shew of reason. For
according to this platforme, when the
Moone commeth into the first signe,
Aries, shee ruleth in the head; & when
shee commeth into the second signe,
Taurus, in the necke; and so descends
downe from part to part, in some part
ruling two, in some three daies, &c.
Where obserue, that the Moone is
made then to rule in the cold and moist
parts, when shee is in hoate and drie
signes: when as in reason, a more consonant
order were this; that when the
Moone were in hoate and drie signes,
as Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius, shee should
rule in hoat and drie parts of the bodie;
and when shee is in colde and moist
signes, shee should rule in the colde and
moist parts of the bodies; and so still gouerne
those parts, which in temperature
come nearest to the nature of the signes
wherein the Moone is.
                  Besides this, some learned Physitians
haue vpon experience confessed, that

the obseruation of the signe, is nothing
materiall, and that there is no danger in
it, for gelding of cattell, or letting of
blood. Indeede it preuailes oftentimes
by an old conceit and strong imagination,
of some vnlettered persons, who
thinke it to be of force and efficacie for
restoring and curing: and yet the vanitie
of this conceit, appeares in the common
practise of men, who commonly
vpon S. Stevens day vse to let blood, be
the signe where it will; though it be in
the place where the veine is opened.
But the truth is, the signe in it owne nature,
is neither way auaileable, beeing
but a fancie, grounded vpon supposed
premisses, and therefore ought to be reiected,
as a meere vanitie.
                  The second thing belonging to Astrologie,
which ought to be eschewed,
is the choice and obseruation of daies.
Curious diuiners doe set apart certaine
dayes, whereof some are (as they say)
luckie, some vnluckie. And these they
appoint to be obserued for the beginning
of ordinary works & businesses; as
to take a iourney; to beginne to lay the

foundation of a building, to plant a
garden, to weane a child, to put on new
apparell, to flit into a new house, to trafficke
into other countries, to goe about
a suite to a Prince, or some great man,
to hunt and vse exercises, to pare the
nayles, to cut the haire; in a word, to attempt
any thing in purpose or action,
which is not done euery day. The effect
and force of these daies, is not grounded
either in arte or in nature, but onely
in superstitious conceit and diabolicall
confidence, vpon a wicked custome,
borrowed from the practise of diuiners:
and the daunger of such confident conceits
is this; that the Deuill by them
takes the vantage of fantasticall persons,
and brings them further into league and
acquaintance with himselfe, vnlesse they
leaue them. And all such persons as
make difference of daies for this or that
purpose, are in expresse words plainly
condemned, Deut. 18. 10, 11.
                  § 4. The fourth kind of Diuination
by true meanes, is the prediction of
things to come by dreames.
                  In the old Testament we read tha
                        •
                     
                     
Sorcerers and false Prophets vsed to
foretell strange euents, by reuelations
which they had in their dreames. Such
diuiners were among the Iewes: and for
that cause the people of God were expressely
forbidden to harken vnto Dreamers
of dreames, Deut. 13. 3. And the
Lord himselfe by the Prophet Ieremie,
taxeth the false Prophets, who broached
false doctrine in his name by this deuillish
meanes, saying, I haue dreamed, I haue
dreamed, Ier. 23. 25.
                  Yet here it is to be remembred, that
foretelling of future things by dreames,
is not simply to be condemned, but onely
in part. For of dreames there be three
sorts, Diuine, Naturall, and Diabolicall. Diuine,
are▪ those which come from God:
Naturall, which proceede from a mans
owne nature, and arise from the qualitie
and constitution of the bodie: Diabolicall,
which are caused by the suggestion
of the deuill.
                  Touching Diuine dreames: that there
are, or at least haue beene such, it is euident.
For these be the words of God,
Numb. 12. 6. If there be a Prophet of the

Lord among you, I will be knowne vnto him
by a vision, and will speake vnto him by a
dreame. And Iob saith, that God speaketh
in dreames and visions of the night, when
sleepe falleth vpon men, and they sleepe vpon
their beds, Iob. 33. 15. Now these diuine
dreames were caused in men, either immediately
by God himselfe, as the former
places shew; or by meanes of some
good Angel. In this latter kind was Ioseph
of
                        •
                     en admonished in dreames what
to doe, by the ministerie of an Angel; as
Matth. 1. 20. and chap. 2. 13. 19. and diuining
by such dreames, is not condemned▪
for by them the most worthie Prophets
of God haue reueiled Gods will
in many things to his Church. Thus
Ioseph by dreame had notice giuen him
of his owne aduancement, Gen. 37. 7. 9.
and by Pharaohs dreames which were
sent from God, he also foretold the state
of the kingdome of Egypt, touching
prouision for seauen years dearth, Gen.
41. 25. By the same meanes the Prophet
Daniel prophesied of the flourishing &
fading of the chiefe Monarchies of the
world, from his time to the comming

of Christ, Dan. 9. &c. these therefore
beeing one of the extraordinary means,
whereby God hath manifested his will
vnto man in times past, more or lesse;
diuination by them is not to be censured
as vnlawfull, but rather to be honoured
and esteemed, as the ordinance
of God.
                  For the second sort which be Naturall,
arising either from the thoughts of
the mind, or the affections of the heart,
or the constitution of the bodie: as they
are ordinarie in all mē, in some more, in
some lesse: so they vary according to the
diuersitie of mens thoughts, affections,
and constitutions: and by them a man
may probably coniecture of sundrie
things concerning the state and disposition,
partly of his bodie, and partly
of his minde.
                  As first he may gesse in likelihood,
what is his constitution, as the learned
in all ages, doe constantly auouch. For
when his mind in dreaming runnes vpon
warrs, and contentions, fire, and such
like, it argueth his complexion is cholerick.
When he dreames of waters

and 
                        〈◊〉
                     , it betokeneth abundance
of phlegme. When his phantasie
conceiueth heauie and dolefull things,
full of griefe, feare, and horrour, it bewraieth
a melancholike constitution.
When his dreames be ioyfull and pleasant,
as of mirth, pastimes, and delightful
newes, his complexion is iudged to be
sang
                        •
                     i
                        ••
                     .
                  
                     
                        •
                      Againe, by naturall dreames a man
may gess
                        •
                     ar the corruption of his owne
heart
                        •
                     
                     ▪ and know to what sinnes he is
most naturally inclined. For looke what
mon doe ordinarily in the day time
conceiue and imagine in their corrupt
hearts, of the same, for the most part,
they d
                        •
                     e corruptly dreame in the night.
And this is the rather to be obserued,
because though the wicked man shut
his eyes, and stoppe his eares, and harden
his heart, and will not take notice
of his enormities by the light of the
Law; yet euen by his owne dreames in
the night, his wickednes shall be in part
discouered, and his conscience thereby
conuinced, and he himselfe left in the
end inexcusable before God. Now albeit

a man may giue a probable coniecture
of the premisses by natural drems;
yet no diuination of things to come,
whether publike or priuate, good or
bad, can be made by them, either concerning
persons, families, or kingdoms.
Therefore the common obseruations
of dreames in the world, whereby men
imagine things to come to passe, & accordingly
foretel them by those means,
are vaine and superstitious, and iustly
so condemned in the places before named,
Deut. 13. Ier. 23.
                  Concerning the thirde kinde of
dreames, which are caused by the deuil;
It hath beene granted in all ages for a
truth, that Satan can frame dreames in
the brayne of man, and by them reueale
his diui
                        •
                     ations. And it is plainly manifested
by the continuall obseruation of
the Gentiles, before the comming of
Christ. For when Oracles, (that is, answers
from the deuill) were in force,
men that vsed to consult with them, and
desired to be resolued in matters of
doubt, were to lay them downe and
sleepe beside the altar of Apollo, where

they had offred their gift, and sleeping
they receiued in a dreame, the answer
for which they came; and this dreame
was framed in the braine of him that
slept, by the deuill, and in it the answer
was deliuered by him speaking at
or in the Oracle. So likewise in the Primitiue
Church, since the comming of
Christ, though Oracles then ceased,
which were the greatest and strongest
delusions that euer Satan had: yet he
hath by dreames and visions wrought
in the heads of many men most strange
and curious concei
                        •
                     s for the raising vp
of heresies, to the great disturbance of
the peace of the Church. For we read
in Ecclesiasticall stori
                        •
                     s, that the Maniches
had their damnable opinions first
inspired into them, and then confirmed
by dreames. And in this age the first
authors of the sect of the Anabaptists,
had their curious conceits of reuelation,
partly in dreames, partly in visions.
Likewise the Familie of loue haue their
reuelations in dreames. For he that desires
to become one of that sect, must
ascend thereunto by degrees, before he

can come to perfection to be an elder
illuminate, or a man deified; to which
estate when he is once come, he hath
for his confirmation strong Illusions,
both waking and sleeping in visions
and dreames. Histories of latter times,
and wofull experience sheweth this to
be true, the deuill preuailing so strongly,
that many haue fallen away by this
meanes, beeing corrupted by a doctrin
meerely carnall, howsoeuer maintained
with pretense of great holynes. Againe,
as the good Angels may cause diuine
dreames from God, and therei
                        •
                      reuile
vnto men his will and pleasure concerning
things to come: so no doubt the euill
spirits may cause in men diabolicall
dreames, and therein reueile vnto them
many strange things, which they by
meanes vnknowne to men, may foresee
and knowe. By all which it is euident,
that there are and may be as well diabolicall,
as diuine dreames.
                  The conclusion then is this: That as
diuining by the second sort is superstitious,
hauing no ground from Gods
word: so fortelling by this third sort

is flat Witchcraft, directly condemned
in the places aforenamed, where men
are forbidden to prophesie by them, or
to regard them.
                  Yet forasmuch as dreames be of
sundrie kinds, as hath beene said, it shall
not be amisse to set downe some notes of
difference betweene them, whereby they
may be knowne and distinguished each
from other. Which point indeede hath
long agone beene handled in the Primitiue
Church, but hardly determined.
For the learned of that age haue auouched
it a very hard matter, considering
that the deuill in these, as well as in other
things, can transforme himselfe into
an Angel of light. But howsoeuer
the case be hard, and the deuil politicke,
yet by light of direction from the word
of God, there may some true differences
be set downe betweene them; as namely
these.
                  First of all; diuine dreames haue alwaies
had their preeminence aboue others,
that generally they haue concerned
the weightiest matters in the world;
as the comming and exhibiting of the

Messias, the changes and alterations of
Kingdomes, the reueiling of Antichrist,
& the state of the Church of God. And
this may plainly appeare by those which
Ioseph expounded vnto Pharaoh, and
Daniel vnto the Kings of Babel and
Persia. But in the other sort it is otherwise.
For if there be any thing represented
more then ordinarie in those that
be naturall, it proceedeth meerely from
fancie and imagination. And as for diabolical,
they are not of so waightie matters,
nor so hard to foretell. For though
the deuill haue great power and skill,
yet it is aboue his reach to determine
of such things as these are, or to foretell
them without helpe from God.
                  Secondly, diuine dreames be alwaies
either plaine and manifest, or if they be
obscure, yet they haue a most euident
interpretation annexed vnto them. Of
the plainer sort, were the dreames of
Ioseph the husband of Marie. Matth. 1.
Of the other sort were Pharaohs,
very darke and hidden, but God raised
vp Ioseph to giue them an casie interpretation
vpon the instant. Gen. 41.

Nebuchadne
                        •
                     sars dreames were full of
obscuritie, and many matters were contained
in thē, so as his spirit was troubled,
and he forgat them; but God stirred
vp Daniel and reuealed to him the secret,
so as he remembred it to the King,
and declared the true meaning thereof,
Dan. 2. 1. 28. 36. Lastly, Daniels dreames
of the foure beasts, &c. were of like difficultie,
but the Angel Gabriel was presently
sent to make him vnderstand
them, Dan. 8. 16. Now those that are
caused by the Deuill, as they be obscure
and intricate, so the interpretation of
them is ambiguous and vncertaine, because
he himselfe cannot infallably determine
how things shall come to passe,
and thereupon is constrained to giue
doubtfull answers by dreames. And
such were not onely the auncient Oracles
among the heathen, where he gaue
the resolution, but the moderne Prophecies
giuen by him to some of his instruments
in later time.
                  Thirdly, the dreame that comes
from God, is alwaies agreeable to his
reuealed will, and representeth nothing

contrarie to the same, in whole or in
part: whereas those that proceed from
nature, doe sauour of nature, and bee agreeable
to mans corruption, which is
repugnant vnto Gods will. And those
that are suggested by Satan, are of the
same nature; the generall scope whereof
is to crosse the will of God, and to withdrawe
the heart from obedience therevnto.
                  Fourthly, diuine dreames 
                        〈◊〉

                        ••
                     e,
and to maintaine true doctrine: but the
deuill, an enemie to God, worketh in
his dreames the subuersion of true religion,
& the worship of God, that in the
roome thereof he may set vp Idolatrie
and superstition. For so much we learne,
Deut. 13. where the false Prophet
brings his dreame, and vtters it, yea and
confirmeth it by a wonder; but marke
his ende: It was to draw men to Apostacie:
Let vs (saith he) goe after other Gods;
which thou hast not knowne, and let vs serue
them, vers. 2. Answerable to which, was
the practise of the false Prophets afterwardes,
who caused the people to erre

                     
                        •
                     y their lies and flatteries. Ierem. 23.
32.
                  To conclude this point, it must be
here remembred, that howsoeuer there

                        •
                     re and haue beene distinct sorts of
dreams, yet those which are from God,
were onely in ordinarie vse in the old
Testament, and in the Church of the
New, are ceased, and take not place ordinarily.
Whereas therefore men in
their sleepes haue dreames, they must
take them commonly to be naturall, &
withall know that they may be diabolicall,
or mixt partly of the one kind, partly
of the other. And howsoeuer there
may be some vse of the naturall, as hath
beene said, yet commonly they are not
to be regarded. And for the other which
are from Satan, or mixt, they are not
to be receiued, beleeued, or made
meanes whereby to foretell things to
come, least by this vse of them, we grow
into familiaritie with the deuill, and before
God be guilty of the sin of Witchcraft.
                  § 5. The fift and last kind of Diuination
by true meanes, is by Lots, when

men take vpon them to search out fortune
(as they vse to speake) that is, good
or bad successe in any busines, by casting
of Lots, whether it be by casting a die,
or opening of booke, or any such casuall
meanes. I mention this the rather,
because among the ignorant and superstitious
sort, such practises are cōmon &
in great accoūt: the Lot is an ordinance
of God, appointed for speciall ends and
purposes, but when it is thus applyed, it
ceaseth to be lawfull, because it is abused
to other ends then God by his word &
ordinance hath allowed.
                  That we may the better knowe the
abuse of a Lot in this kind, we must remember
there be three sorts of Lots;
the Ciuill, the Sporting, and the Diuining
Lot.
                  The ciuill vse of Lots, is, when they
be vsed for the ending of controuersies:
the diuiding of lands and heritages: the
disposition of offices amongst many
that are equally fit, the trying of the
right in doubtfull things, or lastly the
discouerie of a malefactor hid amongst
many suspected. By this vse of the Lot,

was Saul chosen to be king ouer Israel,
1. Sam. 10. 21. the skape-goate separated
frō that which was to be sacrificed,
Leuit. 16. 8. the land of Canaan diuided
among the children of Israel, Iosh. 14. 2.
&c. the trespasse of Achan found out,
Iosh. 7. 15. and Matthias chosen to be
one of the twelue, Act. 1. 26. and of this
Lot Salomon saith, Pro. 18. 18. The Lot
causeth contentions to cease, and maketh partitions
among the mightie. Hereupon the
ciuill vse of Lots hath his warrant in
Gods word, so it be lawfully vsed in case
of necessitie, with i
                        •
                     uocation of the
name of God, and with expectation of
the euent from God, by whose hand &
immeadiate prouidence it is disposed.
For the Lot (saith Salomon) is cast into the
lap, but the whole disposition thereof is from
the Lord, Pro. 16. 33.
                  The Sporting Lot is that which is
commonly vsed for some vaine and vnnecessary
ende; as to set vp banck-rupts,
or such like. This hath no warrant in the
word of God whereupon men should
vse it, and therefore is no better then
an abuse of Gods ordinance, to speake

no more of it.
                  Now the diuining Lot performed by
the opening of a booke, or the casting
of a die, or such like, thereby to declare
good or bad successe, cannot be done
without confederacie with Satan either
explicite, or implicite. For the plaine
cast of a die, or the opening of a booke
without beleeuing, can doe nothing for
discouering of future contingents. And
what is there in the nature of these actions
to produce such effects? or where, or
when did God giue this vertue to them,
certainely to determine of things hidden
from man, and knowne onely to
himselfe? Diuination therefore by them
is to be holden as a practise, not onely
sauouring of superstition, but proceeding
from the arte of Witchraft and
Sorcetie.
                  And thus much of Diuination by
meanes of the creatures; and the seueral
kinds thereof.
               
               
                  Sect. III.
                  The second kind of Diuination, is by
counterfeit, and forged meanes, which are

none of the creatures of God: whereof
one kind onely is mentioned in Scripture,
viz. when Satan is consulted with
in the shape of a dead man. This is commonly
called Neeromaneie, or the blacke
arte, because the Deuill being sought vnto
by Witches, appeares vnto them in
the likenes of a dead bodie. And it is expressely
forbidden, Deuter. 18. 11. yea
condemned by the Prophet Esai, 8. 19,
20. who saith in plaine tearmes, that
Gods people ought not to goe from the
liuing to the dead, but to the Law and to the
testimonie. A memorable example hereof
is recorded in 1. Sam. 28. the obseruation
whereof, will discouer vnto vs the
chiefe: points of Necromancie. There
Saul about to encounter the Philisti
                        •
                     s,
beeing forsaken of God, who refused to
answer him, either by dreames, or by
Vrim; or by the Prophets, inquired for
one that had a familiar spirit: and hearing
of the Pythonesse at Endor, went
vnto her by night, and caused her to
raise vp Samuel, to tell him of the issue
of the warre. Now the Witch at his request
raised vp the Deuill, with whome

shee was confederate, in Samuels likenesse;
who gaue him answer concerning
his owne ouerthrowe, and the death of
his sonnes. Which example declareth
plainely, that there is a kind of diuination,
whereby Witches and Sorcerers
reueale strange things, by means of the
deuill appearing vnto thē in the shapes
or shadowes of the dead.
                  Touching the truth of this example,
two Questions may be mooued.
                  The first is, Whether that which appeared,
was true Samuel or not? Some
say it was Samuel indeede: others (who
hold that there are no Witches) denie
that it was either Samuell, or the deuill;
and affirme it to be some other counterfeit
comming in Samuels attire to deceiue
Saul: both which opinious are
false and here to be confuted.
                  And first, that their opinion which
say that true Samuel appeared vnto
Saul, is a flat vntruth, I prooue by these
reasons.
                  I. Before this time, God had withdrawne
his spirit from Saul, as himselfe
confesseth, and denied to answer him any

more by ordinarie meanes, in such
sort as before he had done. Hereupon I
gather, that it is was not probable, that
God would now vouchsafe him the
fauour to suffer Samuel to come vnto
him extraordinarily, and tell him what
should be the end of his warre with the
Philistins: and to this purpose it is affirmed
twise in that chapter, that God had
taken his good spirit from Saul.
                  II. The soules of the faithfull departed,
are in the hands of God, and doe
rest in glorie with himselfe, and their
bodies are in the earth, and there rest in
peace. So saith the voice from heauen,
Reuel. 14. 13. Blessed are the dead that die
in the Lord: for they rest from their labours,
and their works, that is the reward of
their workes, follow them immediatly, or
at the heeles, as the word signifieth. Now
suppose the deuill had power ouer Samuels
bodie, yet to make true Samuel,
he must haue his soule also. But it is not
in the power of the deuill, to bring againe
the soules that are in heauen vnto
their bodies, and so to cause them to
appeare vnto men vpon earth, and to

speake vnto them. The Deuills kingdome
is in hell, and in the hearts of
wicked men on earth; yea whiles the
children of God are in this world, he vsurpeth
some authoritie ouer them, by
meanes of their owne corruption: But
heauen is the kingdome of God and his
Saints, where Satan hath nothing to
doe, considering that there is no flesh
or corruption, to make him entrance or
yeeld him intertainement. Neither can
it be prooued by Scripture, that the deuill
can disturbe either the bodies or
soules of them that die in the Lord: and
therefore the Witch with all her power
and skill, could not bring Samuels rotten
bodie (for so no doubt it was now)
and soule together.
                  III. This shape which appeared suffered
Saul to adore and worshippe it,
where is the true Samuel would neuer
haue receiued adoration from Saul the
king, though it had beene in ciuill manner
onely. Whome then did Saul adore?
Answ. The Deuill himselfe, who
beeing an enemie to the glorie of God,
was content to take to himselfe that

honour, which a King in dutie is to performe
to God himselfe.
                  IV. If it had beene true Samuel, he
would certainly haue reproued Saul for
seeking helpe at Witches, contrarie to
Gods commandement, & that doctrine
which he had taught him from God in
his life time. But this counterfeit reproued
him not, and therefore it is not like
to be the true Prophet of God, but Satan
himselfe, framing by his art and skill
the person and shape of Samuel.
                  But it is alleadged to the contrarie,
that Samuel a
                        •
                     ter his sleepe, prophesied
of the death of Saul, Ecclesiastic. 46.
v. 20. A
                           •
                        ter his sleepe also he told of the
Kings death, &c. Answ. That booke penned
by Iesus the sonne of Sirach is a very
worthie description of Christian Ethicks,
contaming more excellent precepts
for manners, then all the writings
of heathen Philosophers, or other
men. But yet it is not Scripture,
neither did the Church euer hold and
receiue it as C
                        ••
                     onicall: yea, the author
himselfe 
                        ••
                     sinuateth so much in the beginning
thereof: for in the preface he

disableth himselfe to interpret hard
things, and after a sort craues pardon
for his weaknesse, which is not the manner
of the men of God, that were penmen
of Scripture. For they were so guided
by gods spirit in their proceedings,
that nothing could be hard vnto them.
This priuiledge no ordinarie man hath
assurance of: and therefore this author
writing vpon his owne priuate motion,
was subiect to error, and no doubt this
speach of his, beeing contrarie to that
which is recorded in the Canonicall
Scriptures, is a flat vntruth.
                  Secondly, it is obiected, that the
Scripture calleth him Samuel, that appeared
vnto Saul. Ans. The scripture
doth often speake of things, not as they
are in themselues, but as they seeme to
vs. So it is affirmed, Gen. 1. 16. that God
made two great lights, the Sunne and
Moone: whereas the moone is lesser
then many starres, yet because in regard
of her nearenesse to the earth, shee
seemeth to vs greater then the rest,
therefore shee is called a great light. In
like manner Idols in the Scripture are

called Gods, not that they are so indeed,
(for an Idoll is nothing, 1. Cor. 8. 4.)
but because some men doe so conceiue
of them in their mindes. In a word; the
Scripture oftentimes doth abase it selfe
to our conceit, speaking of things not
according as they are, but after the manner
of men; and so in this place calleth
counterfeit Samuel, by the name of the
true Samuel, because it seemed so vnto
Saul.
                  The third obiection: That bodie
which appeared, prophecied of things
that came to passe the day after, as the
death of Saul, and of his sonnes; which
indeede so fel out, and at the same time,
therefore was like to be Samuel. Answ.
There is nothing there said or done,
which the deuill might not doe. For
when the Lord vseth the deuill as his instrument
to bring some things to passe,
he doth before hand reueile the same
vnto him: and looke what particulars
the deuill learneth from God, those he
can foretell. Now the truth is, Satan
was appointed by God to worke Sauls
ouerthrowe, and it was made knowne

vnto him when the thing should be
done; by which meanes, and by none other,
the deuill was enabled to Foretell
the death of Saul. Where (by the way)
obserue, that in this case the deuill can
reueale things to come certenly, to wit,
if he be appointed Gods immediate instrument
for the execution of them, or
knowes them by light of former prophecies
in Scripture.
                  Fourthly, dead men doe often appeare
and walke after they are buried.
Ans. It is indeede the opinion of the
Church of Rome, and of many ignorant
persons among vs, but the truth is otherwise.
Dead men doe neither walke,
nor appeare in bodie or soule after
death: for all that die, are either Righteous,
or wicked: The soules of the
Righteous goe straight to heauen, and
the soules of the wicked to hell, and
their remaine till the last iudgement:
and therefore of the iust it is said, that
they are blessed when they die, because they
rest from their labours, Apoc. 14. 13. But
how doe they rest, if after they be dead
they wander vp and downe in the earth?
                  
                     
If it be said, that Moses and Elias appeared
when Christ was transsigured in
the mount; and that Lazarus rose again,
and at Christs resurrection many dead
bodies rose againe and appeared.
                  I answer; there were two times when
God suffered the dead to be raised vp againe;
either at the planting of his
Church, or at the restoring and establishing
of it, when it was rased to the
foundation. Thus at the restoring of
religion in Elias and Elishaes times,
the sonne of the Shunamitish woman,
2. King. 4. 34. and the widowes
sonne at Sarephta, 1. King. 17. 21. were
raised. Againe, when God would restore
his Church, which was fallen to Idolatrie
about the death of Elisha, he
caused the like miracle to be wrought
in the reuiuing of a dead man by the
touching of Elishaes dead carkeise in
the graue, thereby to assure the people
of their deliuerance, and to cause them
to embrace the doctrine of the Prophet
after his death, which in his life they
had contemned. In like manner at the
establishing of the Gospel in the new

Testament, it pleased Christ to raise vp
Moses and Elias, and to make them
knowne to his Disciples by extraordinarie
reuelation, that they might beleeue
that the doctrine which hee
preached was not newe, but the same in
substance with that which was recorded
in the Law and the Prophets, both
which were represented by Moses and
Elias. So also he wrought the miracle
vpon Lazarus, the widowes sonne, and
lairus daughter, thereby to sliewe the
power of his Godhead, the truth of his
calling, the testimonie of his Doctrine:
lastly, to make knowne the power of his
resurrection, he caused some to rise and
appeare to others, when he himselfe
rose againe. But out of these two times
we haue neither warrant nor example,
that God suffered the dead to be raised
vp. Wherefore those instances will not
any way confirme Samuels appearing,
which indeed was not true, but counterfeite
and forged by the Deuill himselfe.
                  Now for the second Opinion, of
those which denie that there be any

Witches, and thereupon hold that this
was a meere cosenage of the Witch,
suborning some man or woman to coū
                     terfeit
the forme, attire, and voice of
Samuel, thereby to delude Saul, that also
is vntrue. For he that spake foretolde
the ruine of Saul, of his sonnes,
and of his armie, yea the time also
wherein this was to come to passe:
whereas in likelihood no man or woman
in all Israel, could haue foretold
such things before hand of themselues.
It was not then any cosenage, as is affirmed,
but a thing effected by the deuill,
framing to himselfe a bodie in the likenesse
of Samuel, wherein he spake.
                  If therefore it be manifest, that by
counterfeit apparitions of the dead
Witches and Sorcerers can foretell
things to come: hence sundrie points
of Witchcraft may be obserued.
                  First, that there is a league between
the Witch and the deuill. For this was
the cause which mooued Saul to seeke
to Witches, because neither he himselfe,
nor any of his seruants could raise
vp Satan in Samuels likenesse, as the

Witch of Endor did. But Saul beeing a
King, might haue commanded helpe
from all the wise and learned men in Israel,
for the effecting of such a matter:
why then would he rather seeke to a silly
woman, then to them? The reason
was, because shee had made a compact
with the deuil, for the vsing of his helpe
at her de 
                        •
                     aund, by vertue whereof he
was as readie to answer, as she to call
him; whereas Saul and the learned
Iewes, hauing made no such league, neither
he by his power, nor they by their
skill, could haue performed such a
worke.
                  Secondly, the deuill will be readie at
the call and command of Witches and
Sorcerers, when they are intending any
mischiefe. For here the Witch of
Endor no sooner spake, but he appeared,
and therefore the text giues her a
name that signifieth one hauing rule
and command ouer Pytho, that is, the
familiar spirit: yet when he is commanded,
he yeelds not vpon constraint, but
voluntarily, because he builds vpon his
owne greater aduantage, the gaining of

the soule of the Witch. Where by the
way, let it be obserued, what a pretious
thing the soule of man is; the purchasing
wherof, can make the proud spirit of Satan
so farre to abase it self, as to be at the
command of a silly woman. Againe,
what an inueterate malice Satan beareth
to man, which for the gaining of a
soule, will doe that which is so contrarie
to his nature. It may teach man, what to
esteeme of his soule, and not to sell it
for so base a price.
                  Thirdly, by this, the great power of
the Deuill in the behalfe of the Sorcerer,
is made manifest. For he was presently
at hand to counterfeit Samuel, and
did it so liuely and cunningly, as well in
forme of bodie, as in attire and voice,
that Saul thought verily it was the Prophet:
which may be a caueat vnto vs,
not easily to giue credit to any such apparitions.
For though they seeme neuer
so true and euident, yet such is the power
and skill of the deuill, that he can
quite deceiue vs, as he did Saul in this
place.
               
               
                  
                  Sect. IV.
                  Hitherto I haue shewed the first kind
of Diuination by meanes, both true and
forged. Now followeth the second; practised
without meanes.
                  Diuination without meanes, is the
foretelling and reuealing of things to
come, by the alone and immediate assistance
of a familiar spirit. This kind is
mentioned and expressely forbidden,
Leuit. 19. 31. Ye shall not regard them
that worke with spirits. Againe, Leuit. 20.
6. If any turne after such as worke with spirits,
to goe a whoring after them, I will
set my face against that person, and will
cut him off from among his people. So,
Deut. 18. 11. Let none be found among
you that consulteth with spirits. In which
places the holy Ghost vseth the word
Ob, which more properly signifieth a
spirit, or deuill, in which sense it is taken
in Leuit. 20. 27. and in 1. Sam 28. 8. And
by reason of the league which is betweene
the Witch and the deuill, the
same is also giuen to the Witch, that
worketh by the deuill: and therefore

the Pythonesse at Endor, is both called
Ob, 1. Sam. 28. 9. and shee that ruleth
Ob. v. 7, 8.
                  Now this kind of Diuination is practised
two wayes: either inwardly, when
the spirit is within the Witch: or outwardly,
when being forth of the Witch
he doth onely inspire him or her.
                  An example of the former waie, the
Scripture affordeth, Act. 16. 16. of a
woman at Philippi, that had a spirit
of Pytho; which gather master much
vantage with diuining. And this spirit
whereby she diuined was within her.
For Paul beeing molested, said to the
spirit, I cōmand thee in the name of Iesus
Christ, that thou come out of her, and he
came out the same houre, v. 18. And because
the deuill is wont in this kinde to
speake out of the throat and brest, or
bellie of the Witch p
                        •
                     ssessed, hereunto
learned men haue thought that this
name (Ob) is giuen to the deuill, because
he speaketh out of the witch, as out of a
bottell or hollow vessell: for so the word
Ob, properly signifieth.
                  Secondly, this may be practised

when the deuill is forth of the Witch,
and then he either inspireth her, or els
casteth her into a traunce, and therein
reueileth vnto her such things as she
would know.
                  Of this kind, though we haue no example
in Scripture, yet the histories of
the heathen doe affoard vnto vs many
instances of experience therein. One of
the principall is the historie of the ten
Sibylles of Greece, who were most famous
Witches, and did prophesie of
many things to come, whereof some
were true concerning Christ and his
kingdome, which the deuill stole out of
the Bible, and some other were false:
and all of them they receiued by reuelation
from the deuill in traunces.
                  But it will be said, If the deuill reueileth
vnto his instruments strāge things
in traunces, then how shall a man discerne
betweene diabolicall reuelations,
and the true gift of prophesie, which
God in traunces reueileth vnto his Prophets.
                  
                     Answ. In this point Satan is, (as it
were) Gods ape. For as he in old time

raised vp holy Prophets to speake vnto
the fathers for the building vp of his
Church: so hath Satan inspired his ministers,
and furnished his instruments
with propheticall inspirations from
time to time, for the building vp of his
owne kingdome: and hereupon he hath
notably counterfeited the true gift of
prophecie receiued first from God himselfe.
And yet, though in many things
they be like, there is great difference
betweene them.
                  First, diuine trances may come vpon
Gods children, either whē the soule remaineth
vnited with the bodie, or else
when it is seuered for a time. So much
Paul insinuateth, when he faith of himselfe,
2. Cor. 12. 
                        •
                     . that he was rapt vp
(as it were in a heauenly trance) into the
third heauen, but whether in the bodie,
or out of the bodie, he knew not. But in
all diabolical ecstasies, though the body
and senses of the Witch be (as it were)
bound or benummed for the time; yet
their soules still ren
                        •
                     aine vnited to their
bodies, and not seuered from them. For
though the deuill by Gods permission

may kill the bodie, and so take the soule
out of it for euer; yet to take it from the
bodie for a time, and to reunite them againe,
is miraculous, and therefore beyond
the compasse of his power.
                  Secondly, in diuine trances the seruants
of God haue all their senses, yea
all the powers of soule and bodie remaining
sound and perfect, onely for a
time the actions and operations are suspended
and cease to doe their dutie:
but in ecstasies that be from Satan, his
instruments are cast into frenzies and
madnesse: so as reason in them is darkened,
vnderstanding obscured, memorie
weakned, the braine distempered; yea,
all the faculties are so blemished, that
many of them neuer recouer their former
estate againe: and they that scape
best, doe carrie their blemishes, as the
deuills skars, euen vnto their graue. So
kind is Saran to his friends, that he will
leaue his tokens behind him, where euer
he comes in this sort. The seruants
of God receiue no such blemishes, but
rather a further good, and a greater
measure of illumination of all the powers

of the soule.
                  Thirdly, diuine ecstasies tend alway
to the confirming of the truth of the
Gospel, and the furtherance of true religion
and pietie. Such was Peters, Act.
10. 11. which serued to assure him of his
calling to preach the Gospel to the
Gentiles, and to informe his iudgement
in this truth, that there was no acception
of persons with God, and that to
them of the new Testament, all things
were cleane, and nothing polluted. But
the scope of them that are from Satan,
is principally the suppressing and hinderance
of religion, the drawing of the
weake into errours, the ratifying and
confirming of thē that are fallen thereinto,
and the generall vpholding of the
practises of vngodlinesse. And by these
and such like particular differences, hath
God pulled off the Deuills vizar, and
made him better knowne and discerned
of true Christians. And thus much
concerning Diuination, the first part of
Witch-craft.
               
            
            
               
               CHAP. IIII.
               Of Operative or working
Witch-craft.
               
                  THe second part is that
which consisteth in Operation,
and is therefore
called Operatiue or
working Witchcraft.
               Witch-craft in Operation,
is that which is employed in the
practise and reall working of strange
things or wonders, and it hath two
parts, Inchantment, and Iugling.
               
                  Sect. I.
                  Inchantment is the working of wonders
by a Charme.
                        
                           〈…〉
                        
                      This the Lord expressely
forbiddeth, Deuter. 18. 11. Let
none be found among you, that is a Charmer.
In this description, two points are to be
considered: 1. what things may be done
by inchantment, namely wonders, for I
say it is the practise of wonders: 2. by
what means these wōders are wrought,

that is, by a Charme.
                  
                  For the first: The wonders done by
Inchanters are, 1. The raising of stormes
and tempests; windes and weather, by
sea and by land: 2. The poysoning of the
ayre: 3. Blasting of corne: 4. Killing of
cattell, and annoying of men, women,
& children: 5. The procuring of strange
passions and torments in mens bodies
and other creatures, with the curing of
the same: 6. Casting out of deuills. These
and such like things Inchanters can doe
by their charmes. And for proofe hereof,
we haue the vniforme consent of all
ages, with the records of Witches confessions
to manifest the same; besides the
testimonie of experience in this age: so
as the man that calles it into question,
may as well doubt of the Sunne shining
at noone day.
                  Yet for the further declaration thereof,
we will alledge what the Scripture
saith in this point. Salomon saith, If the
Serpent bite when he is not charmed, no better
is a babler, Eccles. 10. 11. thus the
words are in our English translation:
but they may better be thus read according

to the originall: If the serpent bite
before he be charmed, what profit hath
the master of the tongue thereby; that
is, the Charmer. And so they beard this
sense: If the Inchanter be bitten, before
the serpent be charmed, then he hath
no benefit by his charme. For Salomon
in that place giueth vs to vnderstand,
what power In
                        •
                     hanters haue, and what
they may doe by their charmes, if they
come in time, namely, stay the poyson
of the serpent, so as he cannot hint, either
by biting or stinging. When Balae
intended euill against Israel, he hired
Balaam to curse them, Num. 
                        〈◊〉
                     . 6.
Now this Balaam was an inchanting
Witch; for though he be called a Prophet,
yet this was onely in the reputation
of the world; for his practise was to
inehant by charmes of words: and to
that purpose he was hired to curse Gods
people, that is, to-bring mischiefe vpon
them by charming; which thing 
                        〈◊〉
                     
he had often and inany

                        〈…〉
                      to doe, 
                        〈…〉
                      but that
it pleased God contrary to his endea
                     
                        •
                     ours

                        〈…〉
                     
                     
out into these words: There is no sorcerie
against Iacob, nor soothsaying against Israel,
Num. 23. 23. As if he should haue
said, I know well that sorcerie is powerfull
in many things, and of force to
bring much mischiefe vpon men, yet
it can take no place against the people
of God, because he hath blessed them;
and whom he blesseth, them no man
can hurt by cursing. Inchanters therefore
may vpon Gods permission worke
strange things, as appeares by these places,
to name no more.
                  The second point to be obserued, is
the meanes whereby these wonders are
practised; these are counterfeit and supposed
meanes, not ordained and sanctified
by God, which are commonly called
Charmes.
                  A Charme is a Spell or verse, consisting
of strange words, vsed as a signe
or watchword to the deuil, to cause him
to worke wonders.
                  First, I say it is a Spell consisting of
strange words, because in these inchantments,
certaine words or verses are secretly
vttered, which in regard of the

common formes of words are strange,
and wherein there is thought to be a
miraculous efficacie to bring some extraordinarie
and vnexpected thing to
passe. A point of it selfe euident and
needing no further proofe, considering
it is not vnknowne to the more ignorant
sort, who are better acquainted
with these, then with the word of God.
And these words are not all of one and
the same kind; but some are rude and
barbarous, neither knowne nor conceiued
or vnderstood; of which the auncienter
sort of charmes were wont to be
made especially, and some later. Some
againe are plaine and knowne tearmes,
which may be vnderstoode; as the
names of the Trinitie, some words and
sentences of Scripture, as In principto
er at verbum, &c. Againe, charmes that
consist of words, are not all of one sort,
but some be imprecations, wishing
some euill: others in shewe haue the
forme of praises and blessings, whereby
the Witch either flatteringly commendeth,
or fauourably wisheth some good:
others againe are made in forme of

prayer and petition: and they all are
sometimes plainely conceiued, sometimes
in ruder and more vnknowne
words, as those well know, who haue
heard them, or reade them where they
are to be sound.
                  Secondly, I adde, that the charme is
vsed for a sign: and watchword to the deuill,
to cause him to worke wonders, wherein
standeth the nature and proper end of
a charme. The nature, in that it is a diabolicall
signe: the end, to cause the deuill
to worke a wonder: whereby it is
distinguished from all other speeches
of men. For all they commonly carrie
the nature of the thing, whereof and
whereabout they be made, but the
Charme doth not alwaies follow the
nature of the words, but hath another
nature in regard of the immediate relation
it hath to the deuill, to whome it is
a signe. Againe, the charme pronounced
doth not the wonder, but the deuil
admonished by it as by the watchword
to doe the feate.
                  Now because some are of opinion, in
regard of the ordinarie production of

strange effects by these meanes, that the
Spell hath in selfe some vertuit and
power to such and such purposes whereinto
it is vsed; I will stand a little in the
proofe of the contrarie. That a charme
is onely a diabolicall watchword; and
hath in it selfe no such effectuall power
or possibilitie to worke a wonder. My
reasons are these.
                  First, this must be taken for a maine
ground; That as there is nothing in the
world, that hath beeing but from God,
so nothing hath in it any efficacie, but
by his ordinance. Now whatsoeuer efficacie
is in any creature from God, it receiued
the same into it selfe, either by
creation, or since the creation by some
newe and speciall institution, appointmēt,
and gift of God. For example. The
bread in the Saerament, by a naturall
power giuen vnto it in the creation,
serueth to nourish the bodie, and the
same bread, by Gods speciall appointment
in his word, feedes the soule, in
that by his ordinance it is made to vs a
signe and seale of the bodie of Christ
broken for vs: And so it is in euerie creature;

if the effect be ordinarie and naturall,
it hath it by creation; if extraordinarie
and supernaturall, it hath that by
diuine ordination: So that whatsoeuer
comes to passe by any other meanes, is
by Satanicall operation. Now charmes
and spells, standing of set words and
sillables, haue no power in them to
worke wonders, either by the gift of
nature in the creation, or by Gods appointment
since the creation: and therfore
they haue in them no power at all
for any such purpose. This latter part of
the reason, beeing the assumption or application
of the ground to the present
instance, consisteth of two parts, which
I will prooue in order. First then I affirme,
that by the gift of nature, no words
of charmes haue power in thē to worke
wonders; & I prooue it in this manner.
                  I. All words made and vttered by
men, are in their own nature but sounds
framed by the tongue, of the breath
that commeth from the lungs. And
that which is onely a bare sound, in all
reason can haue no vertue in it to cause
a reall worke, much lesse to produce a

wonder. The sounds of bells and of many
musicall instruments, and the voices
of many bruit creatures, are fartr more
strong and powerfull, then the voice of
a man: yet who knoweth not, that none
of all these is auaileable to such purposes.
Indeede they haue power to affect
the minde, by their sweetnes or otherwise,
but they are not able to bring to
passe a reall worke, either by the inflicting
of hurts and harmes, or by the
procuring of good. I conclude therefore,
that the voice of man by nature,
hath no power to worke any wonders.
                  II. Againe, euery thing which hurteth
or affecteth another, must necessarily
touch the thing which it hurteth or
affecteth. For it is a graunted rule in nature,
that euery agent worketh vpon the
patient by touching:Omneagen
                           •
                         per con
                           •
                        aet
                           •••
                        : But words vttered
in Charmes are commonly made of
things absent, and therefore though it
should be graunted, that they had the
power of touching a substance (which
they cannot haue) yet of thēselues they
are not auaileable to bring vpon things
absent either good or euill.
                  
                     
III. Moreouer, if words conceiued
in charmes and spells haue any such
power as is pretended, why should not
euery word that any man speaketh haue
the same power, inasmuch as all words
are of the same nature, beeing onely
sounds framed in the breast, and vttered
by the tongue in letters and syllables?
But experience teacheth, that the same
word spoken by another, hath not the
same vertue; For the charme vttered by
the Charmer himselfe, will take effect;
but beeing spoken in the same manner
by another man, that is no Inchanter,
maketh to no purpose, for nothing is
effected by it.
                  IV. That which is in nature nothing
but a ba
                        •
                     e signification, cannot serue to
worke a wonder, and this is the nature
of all words
                        •
                      for as they be framed of
mans breath, they are naturall, but yet
in regard of forme and articulation they
are artificiall and significant, and the vse
of them in euery language is, to signifie
that which the author thereof intended;
for the first significations of words,
depe
                        •••
                     d vpon the will and pleasure of

man that framed and inuented them.
Beeing therefore inuented onely to
shew or signifie some thing, it remaines
that neither in nature nor proper vse,
they can be applied to the producing of
wounderfull and strange effects. Thus
the former part of the assumption is
cleared.
                  In the second place I affirme, that
the words of charmers haue not this
power in them, by any speciall gift, blessing,
or appoyntment of God, since the creation;
which is the other part of the assumption.
And I shew it thus: whatsoeuer
is powerfull and effectual to any end
or purpose, by Gods gift, blessing, or appointment,
the same is commanded in
his word to be vsed, and hath also a promise
of blessing annexed to the right vse
therof. To vse the instance before made
for explanation sake. The bread in the
Lords supper, hath this power and propertie
giuen it by Christ, to seale & signifie
vnto euery beleeuing receiuer the
bodie of Christ; and by this propertie
giuen it, it is a
                        •
                     eileable to this purpose;
though it be a thing aboue the common

and naturall vse of bread; & thereupon
we haue warrant from Christs
owne commandement, ordinance, and
example so to vse it. But in the whole
bodie of the Scripture, there is not the
like commandement to vse the words
of Charmes for the effecting of wonders,
much lesse the like promise of blessing
vpon the same so vsed: therefore
the conclusion is, that God hath giuen
no such power vnto them in speciall.
                  If it be asked then, what they are, and
whereto they serue? I ansvver, they are
no better then the deuills sacraments
and vvatchvvords, to cause him to doe
some strange vvorke. For the Inchanter
hath relation in his minde to the deuil,
vvhose helpe he hath at hand by couenant
either open or secret; or at least
some superstitious opinion of the force
of the vvords, vvhich is a preparation to
a couenant.
                  The truth of this doctrine, hovvsoeuer
it be thus made manifest, yet it
findes not generall intertainement at all
mens hands. For there are and haue
beene some learned men, in all ages,

who maintained the contrarie, both by
word and writing; and namely, that
there is great vertue & power in words
pronounced in time and place, to effect
strange things. For proofe wherof they
alledge these reasons.
                  First, that the bare conceit and imagination
of man, is of great force to doe
strange things; and therefore words expressed
much more. Ans. The ground of
the reason is naught. Imagination is
nothing els but a strong conceit of the
minde touching any thing, whatsoeuer
it be, and by reason of the communion
that is betweene the bodie and soule being
together, it is of great force to work
within the man that imagineth diuersely,
and to cause alteration in himselfe,
which may tend either to the hurt or
to the good of his owne bodie: but yet
imagination hath no force out of a man
to affect or hurt an other. A man (conceiuing
desperately of his owne estate)
by the strength of imagination may kill
himselfe; but the same conceit, be it neuer
to strong, can not hurt his neighbour.
For it is no more then Cesars image

vpon his coyne, which serueth
onely to represent Cesar: so imagination
is nothing but the representation of
some thing in the minde by conceit,
and therefore as the person of Cesar is
nothing hurt though his image be defaced;
so when we conceiue of men in
our mindes, though neuer so badly and
malitiously, yet all is of no force to hurt
or annoy them, either in person or state.
                  Secondly, they alleage that Witches
by malitious and wrie lookes in
anger and displeasure; may and do hurt
those vpon whom they looke, whether
they be men or other creatures. And it
is an old receiued opinion, that in malitious
and ill disposed persons, there
proceed out of the eye with the beams,
noysome and malignant spirits, which
infect the ayre, and doe poison or kill,
not onely them with whome they are
daily conuersant, but others also whose
companie they frequent, of what age,
strength, and complexion so euer they
be. Ans. But the opinion is as fond,
as it is old: for it is as much against nature
that such vertue should proceede

out of the eye, or such spirits breake out
of the nerves to the partie hated, as it is
for the blood of the bodie, of it selfe, to
gush out of the veines.
                  Yet for the ratifying of this opinion
they alleadge that which is written in
Gen. 30. 37. where Iacob laide spe
                        •
                     kled

                        •
                     oddes before the sheepe in their watering
troughes, & that by Gods appointment,
for this ende, that they might
bring forth partie coloured lambs. I answer,
that was not a worke of sight, but
a speciall and ex
                        •
                     raordinarie worke of
Gods prouidence vpon Iacob in his necessitie,
as we may plainely see in the
chapter next following v. 9. &. 11. yea it
was taught Iacob by God himselfe: and

                        •
                     f it had been an ordinarie work, doubtlesse
the ga
                        ••
                     es thereof beeing so good,
Iacob would haue done it againe afterward:
but we neuer read that he did it
againe. And be it granted it were a naturall
worke, yet it cannot prooue witching
by sight, because the sheepe receiued
into their eyes the species and resemblance
of the rodds, which is according
to nature: whereas in fas
                        •
                     ination

or bewitching by sight, malignant spirits
should not be receiued in, but sent
forth of the eye, which is against nature.
                  Yea, but the Basiliske or Cockatrice
doth kill man and beast with his breath
and sight, yea, the wolfe takes away the
voyce of such as he suddenly meetes
withall and beholds, and why may not
wicked men or women doe the like? An.
Indeede it is a thing receiued by common
errour, and held of some for a
truth; but no experience of any man
hath yet beene brought for the proofe
thereof, and therefore it is to be reputed

                  Thirdly, they reason thus; 
                        •
                     nchanters
by whispering of words in charmes can
stay the stinging and poisoning of serpents:
for so Dauid in effect speaketh;
that the voice of the Charmer charmeth
the serpent, Psal. 58. 5. It may
seeme therefore that there is no small
force in words for the effecting of
strange works. Ans. It must be granted
that the charmer may inchant the serpent:
but how? not by vertue of the
words in the Charme, but by the power
of the deuill, who then is stirred vp,
when the charme is repeated, to doe
the thing intended. The truth of this
answer appeares by the words of the
text, as they are read in the originall,
that the Inchanter ioyneth societies very
cunningly, namely, with the deuill. Now

these s
                        •
                     ci
                        •
                     ties betweene Satan and the
Charmer, are the very ground of the
worke vpon the serpent: which worke,
vpon confederacie formerly made, is
done by the deuill; and the words of
the Charme are no more but the Inchanters
Item or watchword, to occasion
him thereunto. And let any other
man reapeat the same words a thousand
times, that either is not thus confederate
with Satan, or hath not a superstitious
opinion of Charmes, and al his labour
will be in vaine.
                  Fourthly, the word of God is of
great force in the hearts of men to con
                     
                        •
                     ert
and change them, as it is vttered by
the mouth of mortall man: and this
force is not in the man by whom
                        •
                      it is
spoken: where then should it be, but in
the 
                        〈◊〉
                     ? and if in the words, why
may not other words be of like 
                        〈◊〉
                     
beeing vttered by man? Ans. 1. The
power of Gods word comme
                        ••
                      not
from this, that it is a word, and barely vttered
out of the mouth of a man: for so
it is a d
                        •
                     ad letter: but it proceedeth
from the powerfull operation of the

spirit, annexed by Gods promise thereunto,
when it is vttered, read, and conceiued
which operation if it were taken
away, the word might be preached a
thousand yeares together, without any
fruit or effect, either to saluation or condemnation.
                  2. The word of God is powerfull by
the concurrence of the worke of the
spirit, not in all things: as for example,
in raising winds and tempests, in infecting
the ayre, in killing and annoying
men or other creatures; but in the conuersion
of sinners, in gathering the Elect,
and in confirming those that be
called: and this power it hath also by his
speciall blessing and appointment.
                  3. Furthermore, the same word is not
of power, when it is barely read, heard,
or spoken, vnlesse it be also conceiued in
the vnderstanding, receiued with reuerence,
treasured vp in the memorie, and
mingled with faith in the heart: whereas
the bare reading and muttering ouer
the words of a Charme by an Inchanter,
though in an vnknowne to
                        •
                     gue, in

                        •
                     ude and barbarous words, is sufficient

to procure the working of wonders.
                  Now, though the word of God be
in it selfe pure, and serue to excellent
purpose, as hath beene saide, yet by the
way we may remember; That as it is
with all things that are most pretious,
nothing is so excellent in it kind, which
may not be abused; so it is with this heauenly
word: for it is and may be made
a Charme two waies. First, when some
part of it, is indeede vsed for a charme.
Thus many Texts of Scripture, both in
Latin and other languages, haue beene
abused by Inchanters, as might easily be
shewed. Secondly, when it is heard,
read, recited, or made a matter of praier
without vnderstanding. And thus the
ignorant man, as much as in him lyeth,
makes it a Charme. For in his ordinarie
vse thereof, he neither conceiueth, nor
taketh care to vnderstand it, as lamentable
experience teacheth. Yet in neither
of these is the very bare repeating of the
word effectuall. For as when a man
heares or reades it, vnlesse the Spirit of
God inlighteneth his heart, it is to no
purpose; so when it is made the matter

of a Spell, nothing will be effected, vnlesse
the deuill either by conf
                        •
                     deracie,
or superstitious conceit be drawne to
conferre his helpe in the point, for his
owne aduantage.
                  Howbeit, of all Inchantments these
are the most dishonorable to God, most
acceptable to Satan, and most hurtfull
to the charmer, which are made of the
Scriptures. For beside the sinne of
Witchcraft in the Charming, this inconuenience

consider this with himselfe. Cannot
Gods word be effectuall, when it is vsed
to edification, vnlesse the worke of his
owne Spirit accompany the same? then
surely it is impossible, that the same
which is holy, beeing vsed to an euill
ende, should be powerfull, except the
deuill affordeth his helpe for the effecting
thereof. To conclude therefore, let
men say what they will, the truth is this,
that words of Inchantment, be they neuer
so holy or prophane, either by way
of cursing or blessing, haue no power of
themselues to the producing of strange
workes: but are (as hath beene said) onely
diabolicall signes, admonishing the
Deuill of some wickednes intended and
desired, which he through his power
must cause to be done.
                  And thus much of Inchantment
standing vpon the practise of wonders
by a Charme.
                  To this head of Inchantment, sundry
other practises of Witches are to be
referred, the chiefe whereof are these.
                  
                     
First, the vsing and making of Characters,
Images, or Figures, specially the
framing of Circles, for this end to work
wonders by them. As, to draw the picture
of a child, or mā, or other creature
in clay, or waxe, and to burie the same in
the ground, or to hide it in some secret
place, or to burn it in the fire, therby intending
to hurt or kill the partie resembled.
Againe, to make an impression into
the saide picture, by pricking or gashing
the heart or any other place, with
intent to procure dangerous or deadly
pains to the same parts. This is a meere
practise of Inchantment, & the making
of the image, and vsing of it to this end,
is in vertue a Charme, though no words
be vsed. For the bare picture hath no
more power of it selfe to hurt the bodie
represented, then bare words. All that is
done commeth by the worke of the deuill,
who alone by the vsing of the picture
in that sort, is occasioned so or so,
to worke the parties destruction.
                  Secondly, hither we may referre the
vsing of Amulets, that is, remedies and
preseruatiues against inchantments, 
                        •
                     orceries,

and bewitchings, made of herbes
or some such things, and hanged about
the necke for that ende.
                  Thirdly, the vsing of Exorcismes,
that is, certaine set formes of words vsed
in way of ad
                        •
                     uration, for some extraordinarie
ende. A practise vsuall in the
Church of Rome, whereby the priest
co
                        •
                     iures the salt, holy-water, creame,

                        •
                     pittle, oyle, pal
                        •
                     es, &c. all which are
in truth meere inchantements. For
howsoeuer the Councell of Trent hath
ratified thē by their decrees,
                        
                           〈…〉
                        
                        ▪
                      & so commended
them to general vse within the
compasse of the Popish Church; yet
they haue in them no power or abili
                        •
                     ie
of blessing or cursing, either by nature,
or Gods appoyntment.
                  Fourthly, In this number we reckon
the vsing of the name Iesus, to d
                        •

                     euent Witchcraft;
a common practise among the ignorant.
Wherein the wonderfull malice
of Satan bew

                     aies it selfe, in making
the ignorant people thinke that Christ
is a coniurer, and that there is vertue in
the naming o
                        •
                      his name, to doe some

strange thing. Whereas the truth is, he
careth neither for this name, nor for all
the names of God, if a man goes no further
thē the bare repeating of them; but
rather delighteth to see them so abused
and disgraced. And hereupon it is, that
in all coniurations, when he is raised by
the Sorcerer, he is willing to be adi
                        •
                     
                     red
by all the holy names of God that
are in the Scripture, to the ende, that he
may the more deepely seduce his owne
instruments, and make them to thinke
that these holy names will bind him, &
force him to yeeld vnto their desires in
the particular, when indeede there is
no such matter. Which point throughly
considered, may admonish vs to take
speciall heede of these cunning glozes
and deuillish insinuations, whereby he
intendeth to delude vs; alway remembring,
that the Apostles themselues, to
whom the power of working miracles
was giuen, did neuer acknowledge the
worke to be done by the name of Iesus,
but as S. Peter affirmeth, through faith
in his name, Act. 3. 6. 16.
                  Fiftly, The crossing of the bodie, to

this ende, that we may be blessed from
the deuill. A thing vsuall euen of latter
times, specially in Popery; wherein the
crosse carrieth the very nature of a
Charme, and the vse of it in this māner,
a practise of Inchantment. For God
hath giuen no such vertue to a crosse, either
by creation, or speciall priuiledge
and appointment.
                  Six
                        •
                     ly, the Scratching 
                        •
                     f a Witch
to discouer the Witch. For it is a means
which hath no warrant or power thereunto,
either by the word of God, or frō
nature, but onely from the deuill; who
if he yeeldeth either at crossing, or
scrat
                        •
                     hing, he doth it willingly, and not
by compulsion, that he may feede his
instrument with a false faith and a superstitious
cōceit, to the dishonor of God,
and their owne ouerthrowe. In a word,
looke whatsoeuer actions, gestures,
signes, rites, and ceremonies are vsed
by men or women to worke wonders,
hauing no power to effect the same, either
by creation and nature, or by speciall
appointment from God, they must
all be referred to this head, and reckoned

for Charmes.
                  
                     The vse. Now considering that all
kinds of Charmes are the deuills watchwords
to cause him to worke the wonder,
and haue no vertue in them, be the
words wherein they are conceiued neuer
so good: hereby we must be admo
                     
                        ••
                     shed,
to take heede of the vse of them,
and all other vnlawful ceremonies, both
in respect of their formes, be they praises
or praiers, or imprecations; as also
in regard of their endes, be they neuer
so good in outward appearance. But alas!
the more lamentable is the case,
Charming is in as great request as Physicke,
and Charmers more sought vnto
then Physicians in time of neede. There
be charmes for all conditions and ages
of men, for diuers kinds of creatures, yea
for euery disease; as for head-ach, tooth-ach,
stitches, and such like. Neuerthelesse,
howsoeuer some haue subiected
themselues to such base and vngodly
meanes, yet the vse hereof by the mercie
of God, hath not beene vniuersall.
And those that haue sought for helpe,
are to be aduised in the feare of God,

to repent of this their sinne, and to take
a better course. Let them rightly consider,
that they haue hither to depended
vpon Satan for helpe, and consequently
haue dishonoured God, and renounced
lawfull meanes sanctified by him, which
should not haue beene done in case of
the greatest worldly gaine. For no man
may doe euill, that good may come of
it.
                  But they that vse the helpe of Charmers,
and consult with Wisemen, are
wont to alleadge something in defence
or excuse of their practise.
                  First, that they for their part, meane
no hurt, they know no euill by the man
whome they seeke to, they onely send
to him, and he does them good, how,
and in what manner they regard not.
Ans. 1. Indeed many be ignorant of the
Inchanters courses. But in cases of losse
and hindrance, men ought not onely to
inquire the meanes, but to waigh and
consider the warrantablenes thereof,
otherwise they doe not that they doe of
faith, and so are guiltie of sinne before
God, Rom. 14. last vers. 2. Put the case

they themselues meane no hurt, yet in
this action they doe hurt to themselues,
by reposing trust in things, which vpon
better consideration they shall finde to
be dishonourable, and therefore hatefull
to God.
                  Secondly, they alledge; we goe to
the Physician for counsell, we take his
Recipe, but we know not what it meaneth;
yet we vse it, and finde benefite; if
this be lawfull, why may we not as well
take benefit by the Wiseman, whose
courses we be ignorant of? Ans. 1.
Physick vsed in time and place, is a worthy
ordinance of God, and therefore
beeing rightly vsed, God giues his blessing
to it. But for inchantment it was
neuer sanctified by God, and therefore
cannot be vsed in any assurance of his
blessing. 2. The Physicians receit being
a composition and mixture of naturall
things, though a man knowes it not, yet
he takes it into his stomake, or applies
it to his bodie, and sensibly perceiues the
vertue and eff
                           •
                        cacie thereof in the working:
whereas the Charmers course
consisteth of words, which neither are

knowne in themselues, nor are manifest
in their vse to sense or vnderstanding.
And hereby it is plaine, there is not the
same reason of Physicke and charmes:
the one hauing a sensible operation by
vertue giuen it of God; the other insensible,
and wrought aboue ordinaric
meanes by the worke of Satan.
                  Thirdly, they alleadge, God is mercifull,
and he hath prouided a salue for
euery sore, they haue vsed other means,
but they haue not succeeded, and what
should they doe more, may they not in
extremitie repaire to the Inchaunter,
and see what he can doe for them, rather
then their goods and cattell should
be lost and spoyled? Ans. 1. It were better
for you to bide by the losse, yea to
liue and die in any sickenes, then to
tempt God by seeking help at charmers
hands: for their helpe is dangerous,
and commeth from the deuill, whereupon
if ye rest your selues, ye ioyne
league with him, and so hazzard eternally
the safetie both of bodies and
soules. 2. Vse good meanes allowed of
God, and when they haue beene vsed

often without successe, proceede not to
other courses, but referre your selues to
God, and say with Iob, The Lord hath giuen,
and the Lord hath taken away: blassed be
the name of the Lord, Iob 1. 21. And thus
much of Inchanting, the first part of Operatiue
Witchcraft.
               
               
                  Sect. II.
                  The second part is Iugling. Iugling,
                     Iugling
                     is the deluding of the eye with some strange
sleight done aboue the or linar
                           •
                        e course of nature.
In this description there are two
points necessarily required in the point
of Iugling, Delusion of the eye, and extraordinarie
Sleight.
                  
                  Delusion is then performed, when a
man is made to thinke he sees that,
which indeede he sees not. And this is
done by the operation of the deuill diuersly,
but especially three waies. First,
by corrupting the humour of the eye,
which is the next instrument of sight.
Secondly, by altering the ayre, which is
the meane by which the obiect or
species is carried to the eye. Thirdly, by
altering and changing the obiect, that

is, the thing seene, or whereon a man
looketh.
                  This deluding of the sense, is noted
by Paul, Gal. 3. 1. O foolish Gal

kind of sorcerers, which in full meaning
signifieth thus much: who hath deluded
your eyes, and caused you to thinke
you see that, which you see not. As if he
should haue said, Looke as the Iugler,
by his deuillish art, deludeth the outward
eye, and maketh men thinke they
see that, which indeede they doe not:
Euen so the false Apostles, by their erroneous
doctrine, haue deluded the eies
of your minds, and haue caused you, Galatians,
to iudge that to be the word of
God, which is not, and that to be truth,
which is error and falshood. Paul giues
vs to vnderstand by the very phrase vsed,
that there is such a kind of Iugling,
as is able to deceiue the eye: For
otherwise his comparison would not
hold.
                  The second thing required in Iugling,
is a Sleight done aboue the order

and course of nature. This is the point
which maketh those conueiances to be
Witchcraft. For if they were within the
compasse of nature, they could not be
rightly 
                        •
                     earmed and reputed Sorceries;
considering that diuerse men, by reason
of the agilitie of their bodies, & sleight
of their hands, are able to worke diuers
feats, which seeme strange to the beholders,
and yet not meddle with Witchcraft.
Againe, some by the lawfull art of
the Optiks, may shew strange & admirable
things, by meanes of light and
darknesso, and yet may be free from impution
of Magicall worke
                        •
                     ; because
they keepe themselues wholly within
the power and practise of nature. But
sleights done 
                        〈◊〉
                      ouer and aboue
delusiō, must passe the ordinarie bounds
and precincts of nature, and so are made
points of Witchcraft. One memorable
example, for the clearer manifestation
of this point, we haue in the Scripture,
by name in the 7, 8, and 9, Chapters
of Exodus, where Moses and Aaron
wrought wonders before Pharaoh, turning
the rodde into a serpent, and

water into blood, with many other such
like. Now Iannes and Iambres (for so Paul
calleth them, 2. Tim▪ 3. 8.) the Magicians
of Egypt, did worke the same miracles
which Moses and Aaron had done: But
here was the difference
                        •
                      Moses made
true creatures, and wrought true miracles,
whereas they did all in appearance
and outward shew. For theirs were not
true reall actions, but onely Magicall illusions,
wrought by the sleight & subtilty
of the deuil, in the practise of lugling.
                  And because some thinke, that the
serpents and froggs caused by the Magitians,
were true creatures, and all their
other workes as really and truely done,
as those which Moses and Aaron did, I
will here stand a little to shewe and
prooue the contrarie, that they were
onely in shew and appearance, and not
in deede and truth.
                  First then, if the frogs and serpents
caused by Iannes and Iambres were true
creatures indeede, and their other
sleights true and reall works; then they
were made and caused either by the deuill,
or by God himselfe: (for no man

of himselfe can make a rod to become a
true serpent.) But this was done neither
by the deuill, nor by God, as shall appea
                        •
                     e
in the sequel
                        •
                     .
                  They were not done by the Deuill;
because the deuill cannot make a true
creature, either serpent or frogge.
                  Hovv doth that appeare? Ans. To
make a true creature of any sort, by producing
the same out of the causes, is a
vvork seruing to continue the creation,
and is indeede a kinde of creation. Now
the deuill as he cannot create a thing at
the first, so he is not able to continue
the same by a new creation: that beeing
a propertie belonging to God onely.
For better conceiuing hereof, we must
know, that God crea
                        •
                     eth two waies: either
primarily in the beginning, whē he
made all things of nothing, Gen. 1. 1.
or secōdarily, in the gouernment of the
world, when he produceth a true creature
in a true miracle: yet not making it
of nothing (as he did in the beginning)
but producing it by ministring and in
forming the matter immediately by
himselfe, without the aide of ordinarie

meanes and instruments appointed after
the creation. The former is creation
properly called; the latter a continuance
thereof. Both these God hath reserued
to himselfe, as incommunicable
to any creature. As for the succession
and propagation of creatures in their
kinds, as of men, beasts, birds, fishes, &c.
it is onely a continuation of the creatures
in their kindes, and is wrought by
ordinarie meanes of generation; but is
no continuance of the worke of creation.
And the deuill by his power may
make counterfeits of the true creatures
of God, but neither by creating them,
nor by continuing their creation; these
two beeing workes peculiar and proper
to the Deitie alone.
                  Againe, if the deuill could turne a
rodde into a true serpent, and water into
blood indeed, then his power should
be equall to the power of the sonne of
God himselfe. For the first miracle that
he wrought, was the turning of water
into wine, loh. 2. And that was no greater
a worke, then the turning of water
into blood, or a rod into a serpent. But

this were most horrible blasphemic, to
match the deuill with the Son of God,
and his finite power, with the power of
the Godhead, by which miracles are
wrought. And the truth is, Satan can
worke no true miracles; neither doth
the text import, that the Magicians did
that which they did by miracle, but by
Inchantment and Sorcerie, Exod. 7. 11.
22. & 8. 7.
                  In the second place, I affirme that
God did not create these creatures, or
cause the works of the Magicians: to be
effected. And this is prooued by the
words of Paul, 2. Tim. 3. 8. who saith,
that Iannes and Iambres (which did
these workes) withstood Moses and Aaron,
whom God had sent, and by whom
he wrought. If then God had wrought
with the Magicians also, he should haue
beene against himselfe, yea, he should
haue wrought both waies, for himselfe,
and against himselfe, and consequently
should haue impeached his ovvne glorie,
for the manifestation vvhereof he
wrought miracles by Moses and Aaron;
which vve may not once thinke of God.

Seeing therefore that these serpents, if
they were true creatures, were not created
either by Satan, because he could
not, or by God himselfe, because he
would not; it must needes remaine, that
they, & all other the Magicians works,
were meere illusions, & not otherwise.
                  Yet for the further clearing of the
matter in hand: the text it selfe yeeldeth
sundrie reasons, to prooue that these
acts of the Sorcerers, were but appearances,
and not things really produced.
                  First, they that cā not do a lesser thing,
can not possibly do a greater. Now Moses
shewes that the Egyptian Inchāters
could not do a lesser thing then the turning
of rodds into true serpents, or waters
into blood. For they could not by
all their power & skill, preserue themselues
from the plagues of Egypt, as the
botch & other iudgements, Exod. 9. 11.
which was a more easie thing, then to
make or change a creature. Nay, they
were not able to bring forth lice by
their inchantment, which seemed to be
the least miracle, but acknowledged
that to be the 
                        •
                     inger of God, Ex. 8. 18, 19.
                  
                     
Secondly, the text saith, that Aarons
serpent deuoured their serpents, Exod.
7. v. 12. hence it followeth, that theirs
could not be true creatures. For in all
likelihood they were all of the same
kind, and of like quantitie, at least in
shew. And it was neuer seene, that one
creature should receiue into it selfe an
other creature of equall bignesse, with
preseruation of it selfe. Neither hath it
been obserued ordinarily, that one creature
shold deuoure another of the same
kind. It was therefore a worke of Gods
secret power in the true serpent, wherby
he would shew that the other were not
true and real, but formall & imaginarie.
                  Thirdly, if the Magicians had beene
able to haue made true frogges and serpents,
then by the same power they
might have remooued those which
Moses brought: for the like abilitie is
required in both: yet this they could not
doe, but were faine to intreat Moses, to
pray for their remooueall. So saith the
text, Then pharaoh called for Moses and
Aaron, and said, Pray, &c. Exod. 8. 8.
                  Lastly, the frogges which Moses caused,

when they were remooued, beeing
gathered on 
                        •
                     eapes, caused great corruption,
and the whole land stanke of
them, Exod. 8. 14. Againe, the water
turned into blood, made the fish in the
riuer to die, and the water to stinko, so
that the Egyptians could not drinke of
the water of the riuer, Exod. 7. 21. But
we read of no such effect of the frogges
and waters of the Inchanters, which
doubtlesse would haue followed as well
as the other, if both had beene true and
reall creatures. It remaines therefore,
that these were but meere appearances
and Iugling trickes, and the Sorcerers
themselues Iuglers, yea all their works
but sleights, caused by the power and
subtiltie of Satan, and no true works, as
hath beene said. Thus I haue declared
the whole nature, grounds, and kinds of
this damnable Art.
               
            
            
               
               CHAP. V.
               What Witches be, and of
how many sorts.
               
                  HAuing in the former
part of this Treatise opened
the nature of
Witchcraft, and thereby
made way for the
better vnderstāding of
this Iudiciall Lawe of
Moses, I come now to shew who is the
practiser hereof, whome the Text principally
aimeth at, namely, the Witch,
whether man or woman.
               
                  A witch is a Magician, who either by open
or secret league, wittingly and willingly,
consenteth to vse the aide and assistance of
the Deuill, in the working of wonders.
               
               First, I call the Witch [a Magician] to
shew what kind of person this is: to wit,
such a one as doth professe and practise
Witchcraft. For a Magician is a professor
and practiser of this arte, as may appeare,

Act. 8. 9. where Simon a Witch
of Samaria is called Magus, or Simon
the Magician.
               Againe, in this generall tearme, I
comprehend both sexes or kindes of
persons, men and women, excluding
neither from beeing Witches. A point
the rather to be remembred, because
Moses in this place setting downe a Iudiciall

                     •
                  awe against Witches, vseth a
word of the feminine gender [
                        ••
                     ecasbephah]
which in English properly signisieth,
a woman Wicth: whereupon
some might gather, that women onely
were Witches. Howbeit Moses in this
word exempteth not the male, but onely
vseth a notion referring to the female,
for good causes; principally for
these two.
               First, to giue vs to vnderstand, that
the woman beeing the weaker sexe, is
sooner intangled by the deuills illusions
with this damnable art, then the man.
And in all ages it is found true by experience,
that the deuill hath more easily
and oftner preuailed with women, then
with men. Hence it was, that the Hebrues

of ancient times, vsed it for a prouerb,
The more women, the more witches:
His first temptation in the beginning,
was with Eue a woman, and since he
pursueth his practise accordingly, as
making most for his aduantage. For
where he findeth easiest entrance, and
best entertainement, thither will he oftnest
resert.
               Secondly, to take away all exception
of punishment from any partie that
shall practise this trade, and to shewe
that weaknes cānot exempt the Witch
from death. For in all reason, if any
might alledge insirmitie, and plead for
fauour, it were the woman, who is weaker
then the man. But the Lord saith, if
any person of either sexe among his
people, be found to haue entred couenant
with Satan, and become a practiser
of Sorcerie, though it be a woman and
the weaker vessell, shee shall not escape,
she shall not be suffred to liue, she must
die the death. And though weakenes in
other cases, may lessen both the crime
and the punishment, yet in this it shall
take no place.
               
                  
The second point in the description,
is consenting to vse the helpe of the deuill,
either by open or secret league, wittingly and
willingly: wherein standeth the very
thing, that maketh a Witch to be a
Witch: The yeelding of consent vpon
couenaut. By which clause, two sorts of
people are expressely excluded from being
Witches. First, such as be tainted
with phrenzy or madnes, or are through
weakenesse of the braine deluded by the
deuill. For these, though they may be
said after a sort to haue societie with Satan,
or rather he with them, yet they
cannot giue their consent to vse his aide
truely, but onely in imagination; with
the true Witch it is farre otherwise. Secondly,
all such superstitious persons,
men or women, as vse Charmes and Inchantment
for the effecting of any
thing vpon a superstitious and erroneous
perswasion, that the Charmes haue
vertue in them to doe such things, not
knowing that it is the action of the deuill
by those meanes; but thinking that
God hath put vertue into them, as hee
hath done into hearbs for Physicke. Of

such persons we 
                     •
                  gue (no doubt) abundance
in this our Land, who though
they deale wickedly and sinne grieuously
in vsing Charmes, yet because they
intend not to ioyne league with the deuill,
either secretly, or formally, they are
not to be counted Witches. Neuertheles,
they are to be aduertis
                     •
                  d in the
meane time, that their estate is fearefull.
For their present vngodly practises
haue prepared them already to this cursed
trade, and may bring them in time
to be the ranckest Witches that can be.
Wherefore I aduise all ignorant persons,
that know not God nor the Scriptures,
to take heede and beware of this
dangerous euill, the vse of Charmes.
For if they be once conuinced in their
consciences, and knowe that God hath
giuen no power to such meanes, and
yet shall vse them, assuredly they doe in
effect consent to the deuill to be helped
by him, and thereupon are ioyned in
confederacie with him in the confidence
of their owne hearts, and so are
become Witches.
               The third and last thing in the description,

is the end of Witchcraft; The
w
                        •
                     rking of wōders. Wōders are wrought
three wayes (as hath beene shewed,) either
by Diuination, or by Inchātment,
or by lugling: and to one of these three
heads,

                     •
                  eates and practises of Witchcraft

                     〈◊〉
                   to be referred.
               Now if any man doubt, whether
there b
                     •
                  such Witches indeede as haue
beene 
                     •
                  escribed, let him remember,
that beside experience in all ages and
countries, wee haue also sundrie examples
of them euen in the Scriptures.
               In the old Testament we read of Balaam,
Numb. 23. who though he be called
a Prophet, because he was so reputed
of men, yet indeede he was a notorious
Witch, both by profession and
practise, and would haue shewed his
cunning in that kind vpon the Israelits,
if God had not 
                     •
                  undered him against
his will. Of the same kinde were the Inchanters
of Egypt Exod. 7. the Witches
of Persia, Dan. 2. and the Pythonisse
of Endor, known for a renowned Sorcerer
ouer all Israel, and therefore Sauls

seruants beeing asked, could presently
tell of her, as we read, 1. Sam. 28.
               In the new Testament, mention is
made of Simon, whose name declared
his profession
                     •
                   his name was Magus, and
the text saith, that he vsed Witchcraft,
and bewitched the people of 
                     〈◊〉
                  ,
calling himselfe a great man, Act. 8. 9.
Whence it was that after his death,Iust. Mart. Apolog. ad Anton. Pium.
there was a statue set vp in Rome in
honour of him in the daies of Claudius
Cesar, with this inscription; Simoni Deo
sancto. And it is not vnlike, but Bar-jesus
the false prophet at Paphus, was a man
addicted to the practises of Witchcraft,
and for that cause was called by a kinde
of excellency, Elymas the
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   
                  Magician, Act.
13. 6. 8. that is, the great or famous Sorcerer.
Lastly, the Pythonisse at Philippi,
that gat her master much aduantage by diuining,
Act. 16. 16. And all these vsed the
helpe of the deuill, for the working of
wonders.
               Of Witches there be two sorts: The
bad Witch, and the good Witch: for so they
are commonly called.
               The bad Witch, is he or she that hath

consented in league with the Deuill, to
vse his helpe, for the doing of hurt onely,
as to strike and annoy the bodies of
men, women, children, and cattell with
diseases, and with death it selfe: so likewise
to raise tempests, by sea and by
land, &c. This is commonly called the
binding-Witch.
               
               The good Witch, is he or shee that by
consent in a league with the deuill, doth
vse his help, for the doing of good onely.
This cannot hurt, torment, curse, or
kill, but onely heale and cure the hurts
inflicted vpon men or cattell, by badde
Witches. For as they can doe no good,
but onely hurt; so this can doe no hurt,
but good onely. And this is that order
which the Deuill hath set in his kingdome,
appointing to seuerall persons
their seuerall offices and charges. And
the good Witch is commonly tearmed
the vnbinding Witch.
               
               Now howsoeuer both these be euill,
yet of the two, the more horrible & de
                  
                     ••
                  stable
Monster is the good Witch: for
looke in what place soeuer there be any
bad Witches that hurt onely, there also

the Deuill hath his good ones, who are
better knowne then the bad, beeing cō
                  monly
called Wise-men, or Wise-women.
This wil appeare by experience in most
places in these countries. For let a mans
childe, friend, or cattell be taken with
some sore sicknes, or strangely tormented
with some rare and vnknowne disease,
the first thing he doth, is to bethink
himselfe and inquire after some Wiseman
or wise-woman, & thither he sends
and goes for helpe. When he comes, he
first tells him the state of the sicke man:
the Witch then beeing certified of the
disease, prescribeth either Charmes of
words to be vsed ouer him, or other
such counterfeit meanes, wherein there
is no vertue; beeing nothing els but the
deuills Sacraments, to cause him to doe
the cure, if it come by Witchraft.
Well, the meanes are receiued, applied,
and vsed, the sicke partie accordingly
recouereth, and the conclusion of all
is, the vsuall acclamation; Oh happie is
the day, that euer I met with such a man
or woman to helpe me!
               Here obserue, that both haue a stroke

in this action: the bad Witch hurt him,
the good healeth him; but the truth is,
the latter hath done him a thousand fold
more harme then the former. For the
one did onely hurt the bodie, but the
deuill by meanes of the other, though
he haue left the bodie in good plight,
yet he hath laid fast hold on the soule,
and by curing the body, hath killed that.
And the partie thus cured, cannot say
with Dauid: The Lord is my helper; but
the Deuill is my helper; for by him he
is cured. Of both these kinds of witches
the present Law of Moses must be vnderstood.
               This point well considered, yeeldeth
matter both of instruction and practise.
               Of instruction, in that it shewes the
cunning and craftie dealing of Satan,
who afficteth and tormenteth the body
for the gaine of the soule. And for that
purpose hath so ordered his instrumēts,
that the bad Witch giues the occasion,
by annoying the body or goods; and the
good immediatly accomplisheth his desire,
by intangling the soule in the bands
of errour, ignorance, and false faith. Againe,

this sheweth the blindnes of naturall
corruption, specially in 
                     •
                  gnorant
and superstitious people. It is their nature
to abhorte hurtfull persos, such as
bad Witches be, and to count them
execrable; but those that doe, them
good, they honour and reuerence as
wise men and woman, yea secke and 
                     〈◊〉
                  
vnto thē in times of extremitie, though
of all persons in the world they be most
odious: and Satan in them 
                     〈◊〉
                   the
greatest friend, when he is most like
himselfe, and intendeth greatest mischiefe.
Let all ignorant persons be aduised
hereof in time, to take heede to
themselues, and learne to knowe, God
and his word, that by light from thence
they may better discerne of the subtile
practises of Satan and his instruments.
               For matter of practise; Hence wee
learne our duetie, to abhorre the wizzard,
as the most pernicious enemie of
our saluation, the most effectuall instrument
of destroying our soules, and of
building vp the deuills kingdome; yea,
as the greatest enemie to Gods name,

worship, and glorie, that is in the world,
next to Satan himselfe. Of this sort was
Simon Magus, who by doing strange
cures and workes, made the people of
Samaria to take him for some great
man, who wrought by the mightie
power of God, whereas he did all by the
deuill. He therefore beeing a good
Witch, did more hurt in seducing the
people of God, then Balaam a bad one
could with all his curses. And we must
remember that the Lord hath set a lawe
vpon the witches head, he must not liue,
and if death be due to any, then a thousand
deaths of right belong to the good
Witch.
               But the patrones of Witches indeauour
to delude the true interpretation
of that lawe. For by a Witch (say they)
we must vnderstand a poisoner, and they
alledge for that purpose the 70. Interpreters,
who translate the original word
[Mecashephah] by 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , which signifieth
a poisoner.
               I answer: First; the word vsed by the
70. Interpreters signifieth indeede so
much, yet not that onely, but also a

VVitch in generall, as may appeare in
sundrie places of Scripture. The Apostle,
reckoning vp Witchcraft among
the workes of the flesh,Gal. 5. 10. vseth the Greek
word 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , not for poysoning, but
for all Magicall arts, as Hierome testifieth
vpon the place. And that it must
necessarily be so translated, it is euident,
because in the next verse murther is termed
another worke of the flesh, vnder
which, poisoning and all other kinds of
killing are comprehended. And the
same word is vsed in the like sense, Reu.
21. 8. and 22. 15.
               Againe, the word [Mecashephah]
which Moses vseth, is ascribed to the Inchanters
of Egypt, in the 7. 8. and 9.
chapters of Exodus; and to the wisemen
of Babel, Dan. 2. who are also called

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   in the translation of the
Seauentie: and both sorts of them were
witches and sorcerers. The kings of
Egypt and Babylon vsed these [Mecashephim]
for sundrie purposes, and made
them of their counsell; and if they had
beene according to this allegation, poisoners,
it is not like they would haue so

fitted the humors of those two Princes,
Pharaoh and Nebuchadne
                     •
                  sar, much
lesse that they would haue so ordinarily
required their presence and assistance,
in the businesse there mentioned.
               Thirdly, there is a peremptorie Law
against the wilfull murtherer, Num. 35.
31. that he should be put to death, and
that no recompence should be taken for
his life. In which place all poisoners
are condemned, because they are wilfull
murtherers. Now if here in Exodus, by
[Mecashephah] we should vnderstand a
poisoner, then there should be one and
the same law twice propounded for the
same thing, which is not like: and therefore
the word vsed by Moses in this
text, signifieth not a poisoner properly,
but a Witch.
               
            
            
               
               CHAP. VI.
               Of the punishment
of Witches.
               
                  HItherto I haue treated
of the nature of witchcraft,
both in generall,
& particular, and haue
also shewed what witches
are, both good
and badde. And now I
proceede to the second point considered
in this Text, the Punishment of a
Witch, and that is Death.
               In the Iudiciall laws of Moses (wherof
this is one) the Lord appointed sundrie
penalties, which in qualitie and degree
differed one from another, so as according
to the nature of the offence,
was the proportion and measure of the
punishment ordained. And of all sinnes,
as those were the most heinous in account,
which tended directly to the dishonour
of God, so to them was assigned
death, the greatest and highest degree
of punishment. He that despised

the Law of Moses, died without mercy
vnder two or three witnesses, Hebr. 10.
28. the punishment of the theefe, was
restitution foure-fold, Exod. 22. 1. but
the murtherer must be put to death,
Numb. 35. 31. the Idolater and Seducer
were commanded to be slaine, Exod.
22. 20. Deut. 13. 5. the Blasphemer must
be stoned, Leuit. 29. 19. And the VVitch
is numbred amongst these grieuous of
fend
                     •
                  rs: therefore his punishment is as
great as any other. For the text saith, he
might not be suffered to liue, Exod. 22.
18.
               But why should the VVitch be so
sharply censured? And what should
mooue the Lord to allot so high a degree
of punishment to that sort of offenders?
Ans. The cause was not the hurt,
which they brought vpon men in bodie,
goods, or outward estate. For there
be sundrie that neuer did harme, but
good onely. VVe reade not of any great
hurt that was done by the Inchanters of
Egypt, or by the Pythonisse of Endor,
or by Simon Magus in Samaria. And
those diuining VVitches, which haue

taken vpon them to foretell things to
come, hurt not any, but themselues, yet
they must die the death. This therefore
is not the cause. But what if these doe
hurt, or kill, must they not then die? yes
verely, but by another law, the law of
Murther, and not by the law of VVitchcraft.
For in this case, he dieth as a murtherer,
and not as VVitch, and so he
should die, though he were no VVitch.
               The cause then of this sharpe punishment,
is the very making of a league
with the deuill, either secret or open,
whereby they couenant to vse his helpe
for the working of wonders. For by vertue
of this alone it commeth to passe,
that VVitches can doe strange things,
in Diuining, Inchanting, and Iugling.
Now let it be obserued, of what horrible
impietie they stand guiltie before God,
who ioyne in confederacie with Satan.
Hereby they renounce the Lord
that made them, they make no more
account of his fauour and protection,
they doe quite cut themselues off from
the couenant made with him in Baptisme,
from the communion of the

Saints, from the true worship and seruice
of God. And on the contrarie they
giue themselues vnto Satan, as their
god, whome they continually feare and
serue. Thus are they become the most
detestable enemies to God, and his people,
that can be. For this cause Samuel
told Saul, that rebellion was as the sinne
of Witchcraft: that is, a most heinous
& detestable sinne in the sight of God.
The traytour, that doth no hurt to his
neighbour, but is willing and readie to
doe him the best seruices that can be
desired, is notwithstanding by the law
of Nations, no be
                     •
                  ter then a dead man,
because he betraies his Soueraigne, and
consequently cannot be a friend vnto
the Common-wealth. In like manner,
though the Witch were in many respects
profitable, and did no hurt, but
procured much good; yet because he
hath renounced God his king and gouernour,
and hath bound himselfe by
other lawes to the seruice of the enemie
of God, and his Church, death is
his portion iustly assigned him by God;
he may not liue.
            
            
               
               CHAP. VII.
               The application of the doctrine
of Witchcraft to
our times.
               
                  THus hauing deliuered
the true sense and interpretation
of this Iudiciall
Law, both concerning
the sinne of
Witchcraft, & the persons
by whom this sinne is practised;
it remaineth now that I should make
some vse thereof, by way of application
to the Witches of our times.
               In doing whereof, foure particular
Questions of moment, are to be handled.
               
                  I. Whether the Witches of our times,
be the same with those, that are here
condemned by the law of Moses? for
some there be, and those men of learning,
and members of Gods Church,
that hold they are not.
                  II. If they be the same (as it shall appeare
they are) then how we may in these
daies be able to discerne, and discouer

a Witch?
                  III. What remedie may be vsed against
the hurt of Witchcraft?
                  IV. Whether our Witches are to be punished
with death, and that by vertue of
this Lawe of Moses?
               
               
                  Sect. I.
                  I. Question. Whether the Witches of
our times, be the same with those that are
here condemned by Moses Law?
                  
                     Ans. If we doe well consider the
qualitie, and condition of the Witches
of our daies, we shall easily see that they
be the same. For experience sheweth,
that whether they be men or women,
but especially aged women, they be such
persons, as doe renounce God, and their
Baptisme, and make a league with the
deuil, either secretly or openly; in which
the deuill bindeth himselfe to teach
them certaine rites and ceremonies,
whereby they may be able to worke
wonders, as to stirre vp tempests, to reueale
secrets, to kill or hurt men, and
cattell, or to cure and doe good, according
to the tenour of their couenant.

consent declare and manifest this point.
So that howsoeuer our VVitches may
differ in some circumstances from those
in the time of Moses, as either in the instruments,
and meanes vsed, or in the
manner and forme, or in some particular
ends of their practises; yet in the substance
and foundation of Witchcraft,
they agree with them. For both of them
haue made a couenant with the Deuill
one way or other, and by vertue thereof
haue wrought wonders aboue the order
of nature. Agreeing therefore in the
verie foundation and forme of Witchcraft,
which is the league, and in the
proper end, the working of wonders:
they must needs be in substance and effect
the same with the Witches mentioned
by Moses. And yet this point is
denied by some, and the Witches of
these daies haue their patrons, who
vse reasons to prooue, that now we haue
none such as we speake of. Their reasons
are specially three.
                  
                     
First, they labour to take away the
forme of Witchcraft, affirming, that
there can be no confederacie made betweene
the Witch and the Deuill, and
that for foure causes.
                  I. In euery league and contract the
parties must be mur
                        •
                     ally bound each to
other: now betweene man or woman,
and the deuill, there can be no bond
made, and though there could, yet man
is bound in conscience to God, to renounce
the bond of obedience to Satan,
and to breake the couenant. Ans.
There be two sorts of leagues; lawfull,
and vnlawfull: in all lawfull leagues it is
true, that there must be a mutuall bond
of both parties, each to other, which
may not be dissolued; but in vnlawfull
compacts it is otherwise. And no man
can say that this league betweene a
Witch and the Deuill is lawfull, but
wicked, and damnable, yet beeing once
made, howsoeuer vnlawfully, it is a
league and compact. This therefore
prooueth not, that there can be no couenant
at all, but that there can be no
lawfull couenant betwixt them, which

no man will denie.
                  II. Satan and the Witch are of diuers
natures: he is spirituall, they are
corporall substances: therefore there
can be no league made betweene them.
Ans. The reason is not good. For euen
God himselfe, who is of nature most
simple and spirituall, made a couenant
with Adam, renued the same vnto Abraham,
Isaac, and Iacob: and continueth
it with his Church on earth, from
age to age. Hence it appeareth, that diuersitie
of nature in the parties, can not
hinder the making of a couenant. And
therefore if man may make couenant
with God himselfe, who is most spirituall;
then may he likewise come in league
with the deuill, whose substance is not
so pure and sp
                        •
                     rituall. Againe, we must
remember, that in making of a couenant,
it is sufficient, that the parties consent
and agree in will & vnderstanding,
though other circumstances and rites,
which are but signes of confirmation,
be wanting. Be it then, that Satan hath
not a bodily substance, as man hath, yet
considering that man is indued with

vnderstanding, to coceiue of things, as
the deuill doth, and hath also will to
yeeld consent, and approbation thereunto,
though in a corrupt and wicked
manner, there may passe a confederacie,
and a couenant may be made, and
stand in force betweene them.
                  III. Whatsoeuer the deuill doth in
this compact, he doth it in fraud and
deceit, neuer meaning in his promises,
as man doth, and when both parties
meane not one & the same thing, how
can they growe to agreement in any
kind? Ans. Suppose this be true, yet it
onely prooueth, that the couenant
made betweene them, was deceitfull
and vnlawfull. But what of that? stil it
remaineth a bargaine howsoeuer: for it
faileth onely in the circumstance, the
substance, which is the consent of the
parties, was not wanting.
                  IV. VVitches of our times (say they)
are aged persons, of weake braines, and
troubled with abundance of melancholie,
and the deuill taketh aduantage of
the humor, and so deludes them, perswading
that they haue made a league

with him, when they haue not, and consequently
moouing them to imagine,
that they doe, and may doe strange
things, which indeed are done by himselfe,
and not by them.
                  
                     Ans. This reason is a meere melancholike
conceit, without ground. And the
contrarie is a manifest truth, that they
are not so, as is affirmed, parties deceiued
by reason of their humors. For first,
our VVitches are as wise and politike,
yea as craftie and cunning in all other
matters, as other men be; whereas
brainsicke persons troubled with melancholy,
if their vnderstanding be distempered
in one action, it will be faultie
likewise in others, more or lesse. Againe,
our VVitches know that they
sinne in their practises of VVitchcraft,
and therefore they vse subtill meanes to
couer them, and he that would conuict
them, must haue great dexteritie to goe
beyond them. Now if they were persons
deluded, through corruption of
any humors; looke what humour caused
them to doe a thing, the same would
vrge them to disclose it. Thirdly, they

are also of the same stamp, they take the
same courses in all their practises, their
consent in word and action is vniuersall.
Men of learning haue obserued,
that all Witches through Europe, are
of like cariage and behauiour in their
examinations, and conuictions: they
vse the same answers, refuges, defenses,
protestations. In a word, looke what be
the practises and courses of the Witches
in England, in any of these particulars,
the same be the practises of the
Witches in Spaine, Fraunce, Italie,
Germanie, &c. Wherefore the case is
cleare, they are not deluded by Sathan,
through the force of humour▪ 
                     
                        •
                     s is auouched:
for such persons, according
as they are diuersly 
                        •
                     ake
                        •
                     , would shewe
themsel
                        •
                     es diuersly affected, and varie
in their speeches, actions, and conceipts,
both publike and priuate. Fourthly,
our Witches are wont to communicate
their skill to others by tradition,
to teach and instruct their children and
posteritie, and to initiate them in the
grounds and practises of their owne

                        •
                     rade, while they liue, as may appeare

by the confessions recorded in the
Courts of all countries. But if they were
persons troubled with melancholie,
their conceipts would die with them.
For conceits, and imaginarie 
                        •
                     ancies,
which rise of any humour, cannot be
conuayed from partie to partie, no
more then the humour it selfe. Lastly, if
this slight might serue to defend
Witches vnder pretence of delusion
through corrupted humours, then here
were a couer for all manner of sinnes.
For example: a fellon is apprehended
for robberie or murther, and is brought
before the Iudge: Vpon examination
he confesseth the fact, beeing conuicted
the law proceeds to condemnation.
The same mans freinds come in, and
alledge before the Iudge in this māner:
This man hath a crazie braine, and is
troubled with melancholy, and though
he hath confessed the fact, yet the truth
is, it was not he, but the deuill, who himselfe
committed the murther, and made
him thinke he did it, when he did it not,
& hereupon he hath confessed. Would
any man thinke, that this were a reasonable

allegation, and a sufficient meane
to mooue the Iudge to acquite him?
Assuredly if it were, vpon the same
ground might any sinne be laid vpon
the deuils backe, and all good lawes and
iudiciall proceedings be made voide.
                  Therefore howsoeuer the patrons
of Witches be learned men, yet they
are greatly deceiued in fathering the
practises of Sorcerie vpon a melancholike
humour.
                  But for the further ratifying of their
assertion, they proceede, and vse this argument:
They which confesse of themselues
things false, and impossible, must
needs be parties deluded, but our Witches
doe this, when they be examined
or consulted with, as that they can raise
tempests, that they are caried through
the aire in a moment, from place to
place, that they passe through keyholes,
and clifts of doores, that they be
sometimes turned into catts, hares, and
other creatures; lastly, that they are
brought into farre countries, to meete
with Herodias, Diana, and the Deuill,
and such like; all which are mere fables,

and things impossible.
                  
                     Ans. We must make a difference of
Witches in regard of time. There is a
time, when they first beginne to make a
league with Satan, and a time also after
the league is made and confirmed.
                  When they first beginne to grow in
confederacie with the deuill, they are
sober, and their vnderstanding sound,
they make their match waking, and as
they thinke wisely enough, knowing
both what they promise the deuill, and
vpon what conditions, and therefore
all this while it is no delusion. But after
they be once in the league, and haue
beene intangled in compact with the
deuill (considerately as they thinke, for
their owne good and aduantage) the
case may be otherwise. For then reason
and vnderstanding may be depraued,
memorie weakned, and all the powers
of their soule blemished. Thus becomming
his vassalls, they are deluded, and
so intoxicated by him, that they wil run
into thousands of fantasticall imaginations,
holding themselues to be transformed
into the shapes of other creatures,

to be transported in the ayre into
other countries, yea to do many strange
things, which in truth they doe not.
                  I come now to their second reason.
The Witches of our age (say they) were
not knowne in the daies of Moses, nor
of Christ, therfore that law concerneth
them not.
                  To this I answer two waies:
                  First, that their argument is naught:
for by the same reason the Papists might
auouch the lawfulnes of the images of
Saints, as of Peter, Paul, and others, yea
of Christ himselfe, because they were
not knowne in the daies of Moses, and
therefore could not be condemned in
the second Commandement. Whereas
contrarily, the spirit of God, hath so framed
and penned the lawes Morall, and
Iudiciall, which concerne man, as that
they fetch within their compasse all
sinnes of all ages, and condemne them.
And therefore whatsoeuer is against the
Law of God written by Moses, though
it were not knowne, nor heard of, either
when the Law was made, or afterward,
is yet condemned by the same Law.
                  
                     
Againe, I answer, that our Witches
are the same that were in Moses time:
and therfore by their owne reason must
needes be condemned by this Iudiciall
lawe. For by the records of auncient
writers it is prooued, that about a 1200.
yeares before Christs birth, shortly after
the Troian warre, which was 100.
yeare and vpward before the building
of the Temple by Salomon, there were
the same VVitches that are now, as the
Circes, and Syrenes, and such like, mentioned
in theHomer

Tables, which comprised all the lawes
whereby that famons Commonvvealth
vvas gouerned, they made one expressely
against Witches, euen the same vvith
these of our time, for practising the
same things, as blasting of corne, hurting
of cattell, mer, vvomen, and children,
&c. And for the time of Christ,
though there be no particular mention
made of any such Witches; yet thence it

followeth not, that there were none: for
all things that then happened, were not
recorded: and I would faine know of the
chiefe patrons of them, whether those
parties possessed with the deuill, and
troubled with strange diseases, whom
Christ healed, and out of whom he cast
deuills, were not bewitched with some
such people, as our Witches are? if they
say no, let them if they can prooue the
contrarie.
                  The third & last reason is this: Christ
at his comming abolished all sinne, and
therfore miracles & witchcraft thē ceased
also. The Apostle saith, that he spoiled
principalities and powers, and triumphed ouer
them vpon the crosse, Coloss. 2. 15.
                  
                     Ans. This argument is friuolous, seruing
as well to iustifie the traytor, the
theefe, and the murtherer, as the witch.
For whereas it is alleadged, that Christ
abolished all sinne; we must vnderstand
how: not simply, so as sinne should be
no more, but onely in part, in this life,
reseruing the final destruction thereof
to the last iudgement. Againe, sinne is
not abolished, no not in part vnto all,

but onely to the members of Christ.
Whereupon the Apostle sa
                        •
                     h, There is
no condemnation to them that are in Christ,
Rom. 8. 1. because no sinne is imputed
vnto them. But vnto Witches, and all
the enemies of Christ, sinne is imputed,
and not abolished.
                  To conclude, howsoeuer much is
said in their defence, yet the first part is
cleare affirmatiuely, that the Witches
of our time are the same with the Witches
that were in Moses time, in truth
and substance. And so much for the first
Question.
               
               
                  Sect. II.
                  II. Quest. How we may be able in these
our daies to discerne and discouer a
Witch?
                  
                     Ans. The discouerie of a Witch is
a matter Iudiciall, as is also the discouerie
of a theefe and a murtherer, and belongeth
not to euerie man, but is to be
done Iudicially by the Magistrate according
to the forme and order of Law;
who therefore is set apart for such ends,
and hath authoritie both to discouer,

and to punish the enemies of God and
his Church. Now for the Magistrates
directiō in this busines, we are to know,
that in the discouerie of a VVitch, two
things are required, Examination, and
Conuiction.
                  § 1. Examination is an action of the
Magistrate, making speciall enquirie of
the crime of Witchcraft. This action
must haue the beginning from occasions,
and presumptions. For the Magistrate
though he be a publike person,
and stand in the roome of God, for the
execution of iustice, yet he may not take
vpon him to examine whom, and how
himselfe willeth, of any crime; neither
ought he to proceed vpon sleight causes,
as to shewe his authoritie ouer others,
or vpon sinister respects, as to renenge
his malice, or to bring parties into
danger or suspition; but he must proceede
vpon speciall presumptions.
                  Those I call presumptions, which
doe at least probably, and coniectutally
note one to be a VVitch; and these are
certaine signes, whereby the partie
may be discouered: I will touch some

few of them.
                  The first in order is this: If any person,
man, or woman, be notoriously defamed
for such a partie. Notorious desamation,
is a common report of the
greater sort of people, with whom the
partie suspected dwelleth, that he or she
is a Witch. This yeeldeth a strong suspition.
Yet the Magistrate must be warie
in receiuing such a report. For it falls
our oftentimes, that the innocent may
be suspected, and some of the better sort
notoriously desamed. Therfore the wise
and prudent Iudge ought carefully to
looke, that the report be made by men
of honestie and credit: which if it be, he
may then proceede to make further inquirie
or the fact.
                  The second is, if a fellow-witch or
Magician giue testimonie of any person
to be a Witch, either voluntarily, or at
his or her examination, or at his or her
death. This is not sufficient for conuiction,
or condemnation, but onely a fit
presumption to 
                        〈◊〉
                     -strait examination
of the partie to be made.
                  Thirdly, if after cursing there followeth

death, or at least some mischiefe. For
VVitches are wont to practise their mischieuous
facts by cursing and banning.
This also is a sufficient matter of Examination,
not of Conuiction.
                  Fourthly, if after enmitie, quarelling,
or threatning, a present mischiefe doth
follow. For parties deuillishly disposed,
after corsings doe vse threatnings; and
that also is a great presumption.
                  Fiftly, if the partie suspected be the
sonne or daughter, the manseruant or
maidseruant, the familiar friend, 
                        •
                     eere
neighbour, or old cōpanion of a known
and conuicted witch. This may be likewise
a presumption. For witchcraft is
an art that may be learned, and conueied
from man to man, and often it falleth
out, that a VVitch dying leaueth some
of the forenamed, heires of her witchcraft.
                  Sixtly, some doe adde this for a presumption,
If the partie suspected be
found to haue the deuills marke: for it is
commonly thought, when the Deuill
maketh his couenant with then, he alwaies
leaueth his marke behinde him,

whereby he knowes them for his owne.
Now if by some casuall meanes, such a
marke be descried on the bodie of the
partie suspected, whereof no euident
reason in nature can be giuen, the Magistrate
in this case may cause such to be
examined, or take the matter into his
owne hand, that the truth may appeare.
                  Lastly, if the partie examined be vnconstant,
or contrarie to himselfe in his
deliberate answers, it argueth a guiltie
minde and conscience, which stoppeth
the freedome of speech and vtterance,
and may giue iust occasion to the Magistrate
to make further enquirie. I say nor
if he or shee be timorous and fearefull:
for a good man may be fearefull in a
good cause, sometimes by nature, sometimes
in regard of the presence of the
Iudge, and the greatnes of the andience.
Againe, some may be suddenly taken,
and others naturally want the libertie
of speech, which other men haue. And
these are the causes of feare & astonishment,
which may befall the good, as
well as the bad.
                  Touching the manner of Examination,

there be two kinds of proceeding;
either by a single Question, or by some
Torture. A single question is, when the
Magistrate himselfe onely maketh enquirie,
what was done or not done, by
bare and naked interrogations. A torture
is, when besides the enquirie in
words, he vseth also the racke, or some
other violent meanes to vrge confession.
This course hath beene taken in
some countries, and may no doubt lawfully
and with good conscience be vsed,
howbeit not in euery case, but onely vpon
strong and great presumptions going
before, and when the partie is obstinate.
And thus much for Examination:
now followeth Conuiction.
                  § 2. Conuiction, is an action of the
Magistrate, after iust examination, discouering
the Witch. This action must
proceed from iust & sufficient proofes,
and not from bare presumptions. For
though presumptions giue occasion to
examine, yet they are no sufficient causes
of conuiction. Now in generall the
prooses vsed for conuiction are of two
sorts, some be lesse sufficient, some be

more sufficient.
                  The lesse sufficient proofes are these.
First, in former ages, the party suspected 
of Witchcraft, was brought before the
Magistrate, who caused red hoat yron,
and scalding water to be brought, and
commanded the partie to put his hand
in the one, or to take vp the other, or
both: and if he tooke vp the yron in his
bare hand without burning, or endured
the water without scalding, hereby he
was cleared, and iudged free, but if he
did burne or scalde, he was then conuicted,
and condemned for a Witch.
But this manner of conuiction, hath
long agone beene condemned for wicked
and diabolicall, as in truth it is, considering
that thereby many times, an
innocent man may be condemned, and
a rancke Witch scape vnpunished.
                  Againe, our owne times haue afforded 
instances of such weake and insufficient
proofes. As first, Scratching of the
suspected partie, and present recouerie
thereupon. Secondly, burning of the
thing bewitched, if it be not a man, as
a hogge, or oxe, or such like creature,

is imagined to be a forcible meanes to
cause the Witch to discouer her selfe.
Thirdly, the burning of the thatch of
the suspected parties house, which is
thought to be able to cure the partie bewitched,
and to make the Witch to bewray
her selfe.
                  
                      Besides these, in other countries they
haue a further proofe iustified by some
that be learned. The partie is taken, and
bound hand and foote, and cast crosse
waies into the water: if she sincke, shee
is counted innocent, and escapeth, if
shee fleete on the water, and sincke not,
she is taken for a Witch, conuicted, and
accordingly punished.
                  All these proofes are so farre from
beeing sufficient, that some of them, if
not all, are after a sort practises of witchcraft,
hauing in them no power or vertue
to detect a Sorcerer, either by Gods
ordināce in the creation, or by any speciall
appointment since. For what vertue
can the Scratching of a Witch haue
to cure a hurt? where doe we finde it in
any part of the word of God, that scratching
should be vsed? or what promise

of recouerie vpon the vse thereof.
                  But how then comes it to passe, that
helpe is often procured by these & such
like meanes? Ans. It is the sleight and
subtiltie of the Deuill vpon scratching
the Witch, to remooue such hurts, as
himselfe hath inflicted, that thereby he
may invre men to the practise of wicked
and superstitious meanes. And what I
say of scratching, the same may be enlarged
to all other proofes of this kind
before named. God hath imprinted no
such vertue in their natures to these
purposes, or added the same vnto them
by speciall and extraordinarie assignment.
That therefore which is brought
to passe by them when they are vsed,
commeth from the Deuill.
                  And yet to iustifie the casting of a
Witch into the water, it is alleadged,
that hauing made a couenant with the
Deuill, shee hath renounced her Baptisme,
and hereupon there growes an
Antipathie betweene her, and water.
Ans. This allegation serues to no purpose:
for all water is not the water of
Baptisme, but that onely whi
                        •
                     h is vsed

in the very act of Baptisme, and not before
nor after. The element out of the
vse of the Sacrament, is no Sacrament,
but returnes againe to his common vse.
                  To goe yet further, an other insufficient
proofe, is the testimonie of some
wizzard. It hath beene the ordinarie custome
of some men, when they haue
had any thing ill at ease, presently to go
or send to some wise man, or wise woman,
by whome they haue beene informed,
that the thing is bewitched; and to
winne credit to their answer, some of
them haue offred to shew the Witches
face in a glasse: whereof the partie hauing
taken notice, returnes home, and
detecteth the man of woman of witchcraft.
This I graunt may be a good presumption
to cause strait examination:
but a sufficient proofe of conuiction it
can not be. For put the case the grand-Iurie
at the Assises goeth on a partie suspected,
and in their consultation the
Deuill, comes in the likenesse of some
knowne man, and tells them the person
in question is indeede a Witch, and offers
withall to confirme the same by

oath: should the Inquest receiue: his
oath or accusation to condemne the
man? Assuredly no: and yet that is as
much as the testimonie of another wizzard,
who onely by the Deuils helpe reuealeth
the Witch. If this should be taken
for a sufficient proofe; the Deuill
would not leaue one good man aliue in
the world.
                  Againe, all other presumptions commonly
vsed, are insufficient, though they
may minister occasion of triall: for example;
If a man in open court should
affirme before the Iudge; Such a one fell
out with me, and cursed me, giuing me
threatning words, that I should smart
for it, and some mischiefe should light
vpon my person or goods, ere it were
long. Vpon these curses and threats,
presently such and such euills befell me,
and I suffered these and these losses. The
Magistrate thus informed may safely
proceed to inquire into the matter, but
he hath not frō hence any sure ground
of conuiction. For it pleaseth God many
times to lay his hand vpon mens persons
and goods, without the procurement

of Witches. And yet experience
shewes, that ignorant people, who carrie
a rage against them, wil make strong
proofes of such presumptions, whereupon
sometime. Iurers doe giue their
Verdict against parties innocent.
                  Lastly, if a man beeing dangerously
sicke, and like to die, vpon suspition will
take it on his death, that such a one hath
bewitched him, it is an allegation of
the same nature, which may mooue the
Iudge to examine the partie, but it is of
no moment for conuiction. The reason
is, because it was but the suspition of
one man, and a mans owne word for
himselfe, though in time of extremitie,
when it is likely he will speake nothing
but the truth, is of no more force then
another mans word against him.
                  And these are the proofes, which
men in place and time haue ordinarily
vsed, for the detecting of such vngodly
persons: but the best that may be saide
of them, is, that they be all either false
or vncertaine signes, and vnauaileable
for the cōdemnation of any man whatsoeuer.
                  
                     
Now follow the true proofes, and
sufficient meanes of conuiction, all
which may be reduced to two heads.
                  The first, is the free and voluntarie
confession of the crime, made by the
partie suspected and accused after examination.
This hath beene thought
generally of all men both Diuines,
and Lawyers, a proofe sufficient. For
what needs more witnes, or further enquirie,
when a man from the touch of
his owne conscience acknowledgeth
the fault.
                  And yet the patrons and aduocates of
Witches, except against it, and obiect
in this manner: That a man or woman
may confesse against themselues an vntruth,
beeing vrged thereto either by
feare or threatning, or by a desire, vpon
some griefe conceiued, to be out of the
world; or at least, beeing in trouble, and
perswaded it is the best course to saue
their liues, and obtaine libertie, they
may vpon simplicitie be induced to
confesse that, which they neuer did, euen
against themselues. Ans. I say not,
that a bare confession is sufficient, but a

confession after due examination taken
vpon pregnant presumptions. For if a
man examined, without any ground or
presumptions, should openly acknowledge
the crime, his act may be iustly
suspected, as groūded vpon by-respects;
but when proceeding is made against
him at the first, vpon good probabilities,
and hereupon he be drawn to a free
confession, that which he hath manifested
therby, cannot but be a truth. Other
points of exception vrged by them, are
of small moment, and may easily be answered
out of the grounds before deliuered,
and therefore I omit them.
                  Now if the partie held in suspition,
be examined, and will not confesso, but
obstinately persist in deniall, as commonly
it falleth out; then there is another
course to be taken by a second sufficient
meanes of conuiction: which
is the testimonie of two witnesses, of
good and honest report, auouching before
the Magistrate vpon their owne
knowledge, these two things: Either
that the partie accused, hath made a
league with the deuill; or hath done

some knowne practises of Witchcraft.
And all arguments that doe necessarily
prooue either of these, beeing brought
by two sufficient witnesses, are of force
fully to conuince the partie suspected.
For example.
                  First, if they can prooue that the partie
suspected, hath inuocated and called
vpon the deuill, or desired his helpe.
For this is a branch of that worshippe,
which Satan bindeth his instruments to
giue vnto him. And it is a pregnant
proofe of a league formerly made betweene
them.
                  Secondly, if they can giue euidence,
that the partie hath intertained a familiar
spirit, and had conference with it,
in forme or likenesse of a mouse, catte,
or some other visible creature.
                  Thirdly, if they affirme vpon oath,
that the suspected person hath done any
action or worke, which necessarily
inferreth a couenant made; as that he
hath shewed the face of a man suspected,
beeing absent, in a glasse; or vsed
Inchantment, or such like feats. In a
word, if they both can auouch vpon

their own proper knowledge, that such
a man or woman suspected, haue put in
practise any other actions of Witchcraft,
as to haue diuined of things afore
they came to passe, and that peremptorily;
to haue raised tempests, to haue
caused the forme of a dead man to appeare,
or the like, standing either in diuination
or operation, it prooueth sufficiently
that he or she is a Witch.
                  But some may say, if these be the onely
strong proofes for the conuiction of
a Sorcerer, it will be then impossible to
put any one to death, because the league
with Satan is closely made, and the practises
of Sor
                        •
                     erie are also very secret,
and hardly can a man be brought, which
vpon his owne knowledge, can auerre
such things.
                  I answer, howsoeuer both the ground
and practise be secret, and to many vnknowne,
yet there is a way to come to
the knowledge thereof. For it is vsuall
with Satan to promise any thing, till the
league be ratified: but when it is once
made, and the partie intangled in societie
with him, then he indeauoureth nothing

more, then his or her dise
                        •
                     uefie,
and vseth all meanes possible to diclose
them. So that what ende soeuer the
Witch propoundeth to her selfe in the
league, he intende
                        ••
                      nothing else, but
her vtter confusion. Therefore in the
iust iudgement of God, it often filleth
out, that these which are true witches
indeede; shall either by confession discouer
themselues, or by true testimonie
be conuinced. The causes which mooue
the deuill not onely to affect, but to hasten
this discouer it, are two principally.
                  The first is, his malice towards all
men, in so high a degree, that he cannot
indure they should enioy the world, or
the benefits of this life (if it were possible)
so much as one houre. Though
therefore by vertue of the precontract,
he be cock-sure of his instrument, yet
his malice is not herewith satisfied, till
the partie be brought to light, and condemned
to death? Which may be a caueat
so all ill disposed persons, that they
beware of yeelding themselues vnto
him.
                  The second, is his infatiable desire of

the present and full possession of them,
whome he hath got within the bonds
of the couenant. For though he haue
good hope of them, yet is he not certen
of their continuance, The reason is, because
some united with him in confederacie,
haue through the great mercie of
God, by carefull vsage of holy meanes,
and faith in Christ▪ been reclaimed and
deliuered out of his bondage, and so at
length freed from his couenant, so as he
hath eternally left them. Hence it is,
that he labours by might and maine, to
keepe them in ignorance, and to preuent
the vsage of meanes effectuall to
ther conuersion, by laying a plot for
their discouerie. B
                        •
                     t how then comes it
to passe, that all such persons are not
speedily detected, but some liue long,
and others die without any mans priuitie?
Ans. The reasons hereof may be
diuers.
                  First, because some one or more of
them may belong to Gods election;
and therefore albeit for causes-best
knowne to himselfe, he may suffer them
for a time to be holden in the snares

of Satan, yet at length in mercie he reclaimes
them, and in the me
                        •
                     ne time
suffreth not the deuill to exercise the
depth of his malice in discouering them
to their confusion. Againe, for others,
the Lord may in iustice and anger suffer
them not to be disclosed, that liuing
vnder the meanes, where they might
be reclaimed, and wilfully contemning
the same; they may liue to fill vp the
measure of their iniquities, and thereby
be made finally inexcusable, that they
may receiue their iuster condemnation.
                  Secondly, tho deuill suffereth some
to liue long vndisclosed, that they may
exercise the greater measure of his malice
in the world; specially if they be
parties malitiously bent to doe hurt to
men, and other creatures.
                  Thirdly, some Witches doe warily
agree with the deuill, for a certaine
tearme of yeares, d
                        •
                     ring which time he
bindeth himselfe not to hurt them, but
to be at their command. And Satan is
carefull, specially in case of his owne
aduantage, to keepe touch with them,
that they may the more strongly clea
                        •
                     e

vnto him on their parts. But if the case
so stand, that neither the partie suspected
confesseth, nor yet sufficient vvitnesses
can be produced, vvhich are able
to conuict him or her, either of these
two waies: we haue no warrant out of
the word either in generall, or in speciall,
to put such a one to death. For
though presumptions be neuer so
strong▪ yet they are not proofes sufficient
for conuiction, but onely for examination.
                  I would therefore with and aduise all
Iurers, who giue their Verdict vpon life
and death in courts of Assises, to take
good he
                        •
                     de, that as they he diligent in
zeale of Gods glorie; and the good of
his Church, in derecting of Witches,
by all sufficient and lawfull meanes; so
likewise they would be carefull what
they doe, and not to condemne any partie
suspected, vpon bare presumptions,
without sound and sufficient proofes,
hat they be not guiltie through their
owne 
                        〈◊〉
                      of shedding innocent
blood.
               
               
                  
                  Sect. III.
                  Quest. III. Whether a man may preuent
the danger of Witchcraft, and if
he may, than what Remedies he may
lawfully and effectually vse against it?
                  To this Question we answer affirmatiuely,
that a man may. And for the manifestation
of this point, the Remedies
of Witch craft are to be considered. In
the ha
                        •
                     dling whereof, I will proceede
in this order. First, to set down the true,
lawfull, and 
                        〈…〉
                      allowed
and prescribed in the word. Secondly,
the vnlawfull & superstitions meanes
prescribed and practised in the Romish
Church.
                  Lawfull Remedies of Witchcraft, be
of two sorts; Preseruatiue, and Restoratiue.
Preseruatiue are those, which keep
a man from the hurt of Witchcraft.
And these be of two sorts; either such as
keepe safe the persons of men, or such as
preserue the places of mens aboad.
                  For the persons of men, there is one
soueraigne preseruatiue; And that is,
to be within the couenant of grace,

made and confirmed in the Gospel by
the blood of Christ, and that not outwardly
in profession onely
                        •
                     , as all those
be which are within the compasse of
the Church, but truly and indeede as all
the elect are. And a man is then in the
couenant, when God of his grace in the
vse of the meanes, giues him a true
knowledge of the nature of it, and of
conditions required in the same on
both parts: and withall giues him a true
and liuely faith, to apprehend and apply
to himselfe the promise of God in
Christ, touching remission of sinnes,
and life euerlasting; yet further to shew
forth his faith by the fruits of true repentance,
and new obedience. When
a man in this manner comes to be
brought within the couenant, and is in
Christ, he then receiues assurance of
Gods 
                        •
                     auour, and to him belong the
promises depending thereupon, to wit,
not onely of the comfortable presence
of Gods spirit, but of the presence and
speciall protection of his holy Angels,
to pitch their tents about him, to keepe
him safe in soule and bodie, from the

power and malicious practises of Satan,
and his members. The ground of this
assistance is laide downe in the word,
Psalm. 92. 10. He shall giue his Angels
charge ouer thee, &c. And the speach of
Balaam confirmeth the same, who when
he was hired of Balac to curse Gods
people, and had oftentimes assayed to
doe it, but could not, at last he brake out
into this confession, There is no witchcraft
against Iacob, nor sorcerie against Israel
                     ▪
(for so the words are to be read, according
to the true meaning, and circumstances
of the text.) As if he should
haue said, I was of thine opinion (O Balac)
that Israel might be cursed, but
after triall made, I found by good experience,
that I could doe that people
of God no hurt by mine Inchantments.
                  Howbeit we must here remember,
that the promise of protection made
vnto Gods children, is not absolute, but
admitteth exception, as all other promises
of temporall blessing doe, and
that in this manner: Thou shalt be partaker
of this or that blessing, and this or
that curse shall be remooued, if it be expedient

for thee: but if for speciall causes
to t
                        ••
                     e thy faith, and to exercise thy patience,
I make deniall, thou must rest
thy selfe 
                        〈◊〉
                      in my good will and
pleasure.
                  By warrant of this doctrine, a question
commonly mooued, may be resolued:
Whether the seruant and child of
God, may be bewitched or nor?
                  Out of that which hath beene said, I
answer, he may; and that is plaine by
the word. For by Gods permission, the
holy bodie of Christ himselfe, was by
Satan transported from place to place,
Matth. 4. Righteous Iob was miserably
afflicted in his bodie by the power of
the deuill, and his children, who no
doubt were Gods seruants, and brought
vp in his feare, as their father was, were
slaine by the same power. Yea, Christ
himselfe testifieth, Luk. 13. 16. That a
daughter of Abraham, that is, of the faith
of Abraham, had beene troubled eighteene
yeares with a spirit of infirmitie, which the
deuill caused by bowing her bodie together,
so as she could not lift her selfe
vp. v. 11. And therefore whereas some

men are of this minde, that their faith
is so strong, that all the Witches in the
world, and all the deuills in hell cannot
hurt them; they are much deceiued.
This their faith is but a fond presumption,
and no true faith. For no man in
the earth can absolutely assure himselfe
of safetie and protection from the Deuill
                        •
                     
and if any could, it were the child
of God; but Salomon saith, that all outward
things may come alike both to the good
and to the bad, Eccle. 9. 2.
                  Howbeit in this case there is great
difference between the seruant of God,
and an vnrepentant sinner. Though the
godly man be not exempted from
Witchcraft, yet he is a thousand folde
more free from the power thereof, then
other men are. For there is onely one
case, and no more, wherein the Deuill
hath any way power to hurt him, and
that is, whē it pleaseth God by that kind
of crosse, to make triall of his faith and
patience, and out of this case, he is alwaies
free from the annoyance of the
vilest Witches in the world.
                  If then this be the onely soueraigne

preseruatiue to keepe a man safe and
sure from the power of Witches, and of
the Deuill, to haue part in the couenant
of grace, to be made partaker of
Christ, by a true faith, testified by
dying vnto all sinne, and liuing vnto
God in 
                        •
                     ewnes of life: we must not content
our selues with a formall confession,
as many in the visible Church doe,
which wanting the life of faith, doe not
liue in Christ; but striue to goe further,
and to adorne our profession, by framing
our liues according to the word,
that we may haue our portion in this
excellent priuiledge of preseruation,
from the power and malice of the enemies
of God, and all vngodly persons.
                  Preseruatiues of the second sort, are
such as concerne the places of mens
aboad. For Satan contenteth not himselfe,
to haue manifested his malice in
afflicting mens persons, but he also enlargeth
the same to the molestation of
the places where they dwell, by insecting
the ayre, and such like. The onely
effectuall meanes to remedie this euill,
is the Sanctification of the places of our

habitation. Looke as we are wont to
sanctifie our meate and drinke, by Gods
word, and by praier, and thereby procure
his blessing vpon his owne ordinance
for our refreshing: so in like manner
may we sanctifie the places of our
aboad, and thereby both procure the
blessing which we want, and also auoid
many curses and dangers, which otherwise
would fall vpon vs.
                  If any shall thinke the Consecration
of houses and places in this sort, to be a
meere deuise of mans braine; let them
remember, that in the Old Testament,
besides the dedication of the Temple,
allowed by all, there was a Law prescribed
to the Iewes, for the speciall dedication
of euery mans house: If any hath
built a new house (saith Moses) and hath
not dedicated it, let him returne againe &c.
D
                        •
                     ut. 20. 5. As who should say, he hath
omitted a necessarie dutie. Now this dedication
was nothing els, but the sanctification
of them by word and prayer,
wherein they made acknowledgement,
that they became theirs by the free gift
and blessing of God, and further desired

a free and lawfull vse of the same to
his glorie, and their mutuall good. A
dutie which hath been performed by
the seruants of God in ancient times.
                  The first thing that Abraham did,
when he came from Vr of the Chaldeans,
to the land of Canaan, which God
gaue him to possesse, was the building
of an Altar for the worship of God, his
sacrificing thereon; and calling vpon
the name of the Lord, Gen. 12. 8. The
same did Noah before him at his first
comming out of the Arke after the
flood, Gen. 8. 20. and Iacob after him in
Bethel. And they were al mooued hereunto,
because they knew their comfortable
aboad in those places, came not
by their owne endeauour, but from the
blessing of God. When the good king
Hezekiah kept the passeouer in Ierusalem,
his principall care was, that the
Priests and all the people might first be
sanctified, and therefore he praied vnto
God to be mercifull to them that were
not sanctified, 2. Chron. 30. 18. And as
he behaued himselfe in his kingdome,
so should euery master of a familie behaue

himselfe in his house where he
dwelleth, labouring to sanctifie the
same, that it may be comfortable to him
and his; least for neglect thereof, he pull
vpon himselfe, and those that belong
vnto him, the heauie hand of God in
plagues and punishments.
                  The second kinde of Remedies are
Restoratiue, which serue to deliuer men
from Witchcraft, by curing the hurts of
Witches in the bodies of men, or other
creatures. In the handling whereof,
first we will consider, how whole countries,
and then how euery priuate man
may be cured and deliuered. Whole
Countries and Kingdomes are freed
and cured specially by one meanes; The
publishing and embracing of the Gospel.
When our Sauiour Christ had sent
the seauentie Disciples to preach in Iurie,
at their returne he gaue this testimonie
of the effect of their ministerie,
That he saw Satan fall downe from heauen
like lightening, Luk. 10. 18. his meaning
was this; As lightning is suddenly and
violently sent out of the cloud, and (as it
were) cast downe to the earth by the

cracke of the thunders; euen so Satan the
prince of the world, that ruleth in the
hearts of the disobediēt, was cast down,
and his kingdome ruinated by the power
of the Gospel preached. In the times
of ignorance the deuill triumpheth
freely without controlment, but the
mist and darkenes of his delusions cannot
possibly abide the bright beames of
Gods glorious will reuealed by preaching.
The Lord of auncient times commanded
his people not to doe according
to those nations, among whome
they dwelt in Canaan, by practising
Witchcraft, or following after Sorcerie,
Deut. 18. 9. &c. And that they might
be able to obey this commandement,
Moses prescribeth vnto them this Restoratiue,
the reuerent and obedient hearing
of the Lords Prophets, v. 18. In this
our Church, if we would be healed of
our wounds, and banish Satan from among
vs, who greatly annoieth a great
number of our people by his delusions
and damnable practises of Sorcerie: the
onely way to bring it to passe, is the
maintaining of a learned Ministerie, the

aduācing of Prophets, by whose labors
the Gospel may flourish. For the faithfull
dispensation thereof, is the Lords
owne arme and scepter, whereby he
beateth downe the kingdome of darkenesse,
and confoundeth the workes and
enterprises of the deuill.
                  The second sort of Restoratiues, serue
for the cure of particular persons: for
howsoeuer the gift and power of casting
out Deuills, and curing Witchcraft be
ordinarily ceased, since the Apostles
times, it beeing a gift pecu
                        •
                     liar to the
Primitiue Church, and giuen to it onely
during the infancie of the Gospel; yet
there may be meanes vsed, and that effectuall,
for the easing of any person that
is bewitched by Satans instruments.
Those therefore that are in these daies

                        •
                     ormented in this kind, must doe three
things.
                  First, they must enter into a serious
examination of themselues, and consider
the cause for which it pleaseth God
to suffer Satan to exercise them with
that kind of crosse. And here vpon diligent
enquirie, they shall finde that their

owne sinnes are the true and proper
causes of these euills. When Saul was
disobedient to the commandement of
God, the Lord sent vpon him an euill
spirit to vexe him, 1. Sam. 15. Hymeneus
and Alexander for their pestilent errors
were both cast out of the Church,
and giuen vp also to Satan, that they
might learne not to blaspheme, 1.
Tim. 1. 20. in the same manner was the
incestuous person dealt withall, 1. Cor.
5. 5.
                  Secondly, after this Examination,
the same parties must shewe forth their
faith, whereby they depend on the free
fauour and mercie of God for their deliuerance.
How may this be done? by
heartie prayer vnto God, ioyned with
fasting that the same may be more earnest.
In which prayer the maine desire
of the heart must be absolutely for the
pardon of their sinnes, and then for deliuerance
from the hurts and torments
of diabolicall persons: yet not absolutely,
as for the other, but with this condition,
so farre forth as it stands with
Gods glorie, and their owne good. For

these are the bounds and limits of all
temporall good things; of them the
Lord makes no absolute promise, but
with these conditions & qualifications.
                  Thirdly, the parties bewitched must
patiently beare the present annoyance,
comforting themselues with this, that
it is the Lords own hand, by whose speciall
prouidence it comes to passe, and
who turneth all things to the good of
his chosen. Againe, they are to remember,
that he beeing a most wise God,
and louing father in Christ, will not
suffer them to be tried aboue that they
are able to beare, but in his good time
will grant a ioyfull issue. Now when the
bewitched shall thus submit themselues
vnto God, in the crosse, be it that he (vpon
some causes) deferre their deliuerance,
yet they shall not finally be deceiued
of their hope. For either in this
life, at the appointed time, or in the end
of this life, by death they shall be eternally
deliuered, and put in present possession
of euerlasting case and happines.
Thus much of the true remedies against
Witchcraft.
                  
                     
In the next place we are a little to examine
the false and superstitious Remedies,
prescribed and vsed by them of the
popish Church.
                  The most learned Papists of this age
doe teach and auouch, that there is in
Gods Church an ordinarie gift & power,
whereby some men may cast out deuills,
and helpe annoyances that come
by Witches. The Protestant is of a contrarie
iudgement, and holdeth according
to truth, that there is now no such
ordinary gift left to the Church of God,
since the daies of the Apostles.
                  Reasons of this opiniō may be these.
                  First, casting out of deuills, and curing
such annoyances, are extraordinarie
and miraculous workes. For Christ
accounteth handling of serpents without
hurt, speaking with newe tongues,
curing of diseases by imposition of
hands, (all which are things of lesse moment)
to be miracles, Mark. 16. 18, 19.
but all these lesser works, yea the ordinarie
power of working them is ceased:
for it was onely giuen to the Apostles
in the Primitiue Church, as a meanes

to confirme the doctrine of the Gospel
to vnbeleeuers, that neuer heard of
Christ before. So Paul saith; Strange
tongues (that is, the gift of speaking
strange languages, without ordinarie
teaching) are for asigne, not to them that
beleeue, but to them that beleeue not, 1. Cor.
14. 
                        •
                     2. And for the same ende were all
extraordinarie gifts then giuen. Seeing
therefore the doctrine of the Gospell
hath beene alreadie established, and the
truth thereof sufficiently confirmed by
miracles in the Primitiue Church, the
same gift must needes cease vnto vs. For
if it should still continue, it would call
into question the effect of the Apostolicall
preaching, and implie thus much,
that the Gospel was not well established,
nor sufficiently confirmed by their
extraordinarie Ministerie, and miracles
accompanying the same. Againe, if the
gift of working miracles should remaine,
then the promise of God for his
speciall and extraordinarie assistance
therein should yet continue: for the gift
and promise goe together, so long as
the promise is in force, so long is the

gift also: but the promise made by
Christ, In my name shall they cast out deuills,
and speake with new tongues, Mark. 16. was
in force onely in the persons and Ministerie
of the Apostles, and those that
had extraordinarie and immediate calling
from God, and it ceased when they
and their calling ceased. Therefore if
Ministers now should lay their hands
on the sicke, they should not recouer
them: if they should annoint them with
Oyle, it should doe them no good, because
they haue no promise.
                  Howbeit the Papists stand stiffely in
defending the continuance of these
gifts.
                  First, they say, the Church of the
New Testament is nothing inferiour to
that of the Old. The Iewish Church before
the comming of Christ, was the
Church of the Old Testament, and had
the power and gift of casting our Deuills.
So saith our Sauiour himselfe,
Matth. 12. 27. If I through Beelzebub cast
out Deuills, then by whome doe your children
cast them out? In which words he ascribeth
this gift vnto the Iewes, therefore

it should seeme, the same remaineth still
in the Church.
                  
                     Ans. That place of Scripture is diuersly
expounded. Some by children
there mentioned, vnderstand the Apostles,
who were Iewes borne, and had
receiued from Christ this gift & power
to cast out deuills. Which if it be so,
it maketh not for them, because they
had it extraordinarily. But I rather
thinke, that by children, are meant the
Exorcising Iewes, before Christs time,
who did cast out deuills among them,
pretending an abilitie to doe this worke
in the name of God; whereas in truth,
they were all flat Sorcerers, and did it
by vertue of a league & compact made
with the Deuill. Which practise hath
been of long continuance, and is at this
day common and vsuall among the Popish
sort. And that there were such Exorcists
among the Iewes, it is euident.
For such were those Vagabonds which
came to Ephesus, and tooke vpon them
to cast out deuills by the name of Iesus,
and Paul, Act. 19. 13. but the man in
whome the euill spirit was, (so soone as

they 
                        〈◊〉
                      adjuced the spirit) ranne vpon
them, and mightily preuailed against
them, v. 16. Now if they had done this
great worke by the power of God (as
they pretended) the holy Ghost would
not haue called them E
                        •
                     orcists and Vagabonds

                        •
                      neither could the euill spirit
possibly haue ouercome them, as he did.
Againe, in the histories of the Iewes
are recorded many practises of stich as
exercised this power among them. Raphael
the angel telleth Tobias, that a perfume
made of the heart and liuer of a
fish, will helpe a man vexed with an euill
spirit, Tob. 6. 7. which counsell is fla
                        •
                     
Magicke, for there is no such vertue in
the liuer of a fish. And in other histories
we read
                        •
                      that one Bliaz
                           •
                        r a Iew, by the
smell of a certaine roote put to the nose
of a man possessed with a deuill,Ioseph. 
                           〈…〉
                        . 1. 8. c. 2. caused
the deuill to come out of his n
                        •
                     strills;
and forsake him; which thing was done
in publike place before V
                           •
                        spasian and others.
This also was effected by meere
conjuration. For what vertue can there
be in any roote or hearb in the world, a

                        •
                     aileable to command and enforce Satan

to depart from a man possessed
                        •
                      And
yet such fea
                        •
                     es were plaied by sundrie
Magici
                        •
                     ns among the Iewes
                        •
                      Whereupon
I conclude, that the meaning of
our Sauionr in the place alleadged▪ is in
effect thus much; If 
                           〈◊〉
                         the power of Beelzebub,
&c. that is, you haue among you
sundrie Magicians and Exorcists, who
pretend and exercise the gift of casting
out deuills, and you thinke they doe it
by the power of God, why then do you
not carie the same opinion of me also?
                  Their second reason is grounded on
the promise of Christ, Mark. 16. 17. These
tokens shall follow them that beleeue, In my
Name they shal cast out D
                           •
                        uills, &c. whence
they gather, that there shall be alwaies
some in the Church, who shall haue
power to cast forth Deuills, if they beleeue.
                  
                     Answ. That promise was made by
Christ vnto his Church, to be fulfilled
immediately after his ascension. It did
not extend to all times, and persons, so
long as the world endureth, but onely
to the times of the primitiue Church,
and to such as then liued. For to them

onely the doctrine of the Gospel was to
be confirmed by signes and miracles.
And this lasted about 200. yeares next
after Christ his ascension. During
which time, not onely the Apostles and
Ministers, but euen priuate men, and
souldiers wrought many miracles.
                  The third reason is taken from experience,
which (as they say) in all ages
from the Apostles times to this day
sheweth, that there haue beene alwaies
some in the Church, which haue had
this gift of casting out deuills, and curing
the hurts of Witchcraft.
                  
                     Ans. This gift continued not much
aboue the space of 200. yeares after
Christ. From which time many heresies
beganne to spread themselues; and
then shortly after Poperie that mysterie
of iniquitie beginning to spring vp, and
to dilate it selfe in the Churches of Europe,
the true gift of working miracles
then ceased, and in stead thereof came
in delusions, and lying wonders, by the
effectuall working of Satan, as it was
foretold by the Apostles, 2. Thess. 2. 9.
Of which sort were and are all those miracles

of the Romish Church, whereby
simple people haue beene notoriously
deluded. These indeede haue there continued
from that time to this day. But
this gift of the holy Ghost, whereof the
Question is made, ceased long before.
                  To proceede yet further, we are here
to consider the particular Remedies,
which they of the Popish Church haue
prescribed against the hurts that haue
come by Witchcraft. And they are
principally fiue.
                  
                     I. The name Iesus.
                     II. The vse of the Reliques of Saints.
                     III. The signe of the Crosse.
                     IV. Hallowed creatures.
                     V. Exorcismes.
                  
                  I. First, for the name Iesus: Thus
much we grant, that any Christian may
lawfully call vpon the name of Iesus in
prayer, for the helpe and deliuerance of
those that are possessed and bewitched,
but yet with the caueat and conditi
                        •
                     n
before specified, If it be the wil of God,
and if their recouerie may make for his
glorie, the benefit of the Church, and
the good of the parties diseased.
                  
                     
But the Papist by the vse of this name,
intendeth a further m
                        ••
                     ter, to wit, that
the very name vttered in so many letters
and sillables, is powerfull to cast out
Deuills, and to helpe those that are bewitched.
For when it is vttered, then
(say they) the authoritie of Christ is
present, that the worke may be done. A
flat vntruth, and a practise full of daunger.
For let this be well considered,
whatsoeuer any man doth in this case,
he must doe it by vertue of his calling,
and haue also his warrant for the doing
th
                        •
                     reof out of the word; which if he
want, and yet will vndertake such a
worke, he may iustly feare the like euent
that befell the vagabond Iewes
that were Exorcists, Act. 19. 13. Now the
Church of Christ hath no warrāt in the
word, to vse this name of Christ for any
such purpose; neither hath any ordinary
Christian a special calling from God so
to doe. Therefore he may not doe it.
                  And whereas they would beare men
in hand, that the saide name, of all the
names of Christ, and aboue all other
things, is of most special vertue, though

it be vsed euen by a man that wanteth
faith, because the Apostle saith, At the
name of Iesus euery knee shall 
                           •
                        ow, both of
things in heauen, in earth, and vnder the
earth, Phil. 2. 10. and by things vnder the
earth are meant the deuill: we must
know that their allegation is weake, and
that they greatly abuse the place. For
there the name Iesus, is not onely a title
of Christ, but withall signifieth the
power, maiestie, & authoritie of Christ,
sitting at the right hand of the father, to
which all creatures in heauen, earth,
and hell are made subiects; and by that
power indeede (if they had it at command)
they might be able to cure the
hurts of Witchcraft.
                  II. The second speciall Remedie, is the
vse of Saints Reliques; as the bookes,
bones, apparel, staues, or such like, which
being but touched of the parties vexed,
are excellent meanes to recouer them.
                  
                     Ans. The vse of these things, to the
purposes aforesaid, is a meere superstitious
practise. For first, they haue not the
true Reliques of the Saints, as would
plainely appeare, if a true Inuentorie

were taken of all such as they say are to
befound in their Monasteries & Churches.
Secōdly, though they had thē, yet
they haue no 
                        〈◊〉
                      or calling to vse
thē to this end: for in al the word of god,
there is neither cōmandement to warrant
the vse, nor promise to assure any
man of a blessing vpon the vse of them.
Albeit they would seeme to haue some
warrant, and therefore they alleadge
that which is written, 2. king. 13. 21. of a
dead man, who beeing for hast thrown
into the sepulchre of Elisha, so soone as
he touched the bones of Elisha, reuiued
and stood vpon his feete. To this also
they adde the examples of cures done
by Peters shadow, Act. 5. 15. and of sundrie
diseases healed by Pauls handkerchiefs,
Act. 19. 12. Ans. These thingsin
deede are true, but they serue nothing
to their purpose. For first, the quickning
of the dead souldier, came not from any
vertue in the corps of Elisha; but it was
a miracle, which it pleaseth God then to
worke, by meanes of the corps, that the
Iewes at that time might be confirmed
in the truth of that doctrine, which Elisha

had taught them from God, and
which before his death they had, neglected,
as I haue before shewed▪ And it
was a thing onely then done, and neuer
since. It cannot therefore be a ground
for the ordinarie vse of Reliques. Againe,
touching the other examples: I
answer, that both Peter a
                        •
                     d Paul had
the gift of working Miracles, & hauing
the gift, they might vse such meanes for
the present to cure disease
                        •
                     . But the Papists
are not able to shewe, that God
hath giuen them the like gift whereby
they might be warranted for the vse of
the like meanes: neither can they assuredly
hope for successe, although they
should vndertake to vse them.
                  III. The third Remedie, is the signe
of the Crosse, made vpon the bodie of
the partie tormented. Behold to what
an height of impietie they are growne,
ascribing that to the creature, which is
proper to the Creartor, For the power
of working miracles, is proper onely to
the Godhead. The Prophets and Apostles
in their times did not worke them
of themselues, but were onely Gods passiue

instruments, in this manner: When
the Lord 
                        •••
                     ended by them to worke any
miracle, they receiued from him at
the same time an extraordinarie & speciall
instinct, whereby they were mooued
to attempt the worke. They therefore
yeelded themselues to the present
motion of Gods spirit, to be his instruments
onely in the dispensation of the
worke▪ but the sole author and producer
of the miracle, was God himselfe. And
in this case the very manhood of our
Sauiour Christ, considered apart from
his Godhead, had no power of it selfe,
but was onely the instrument of his
Godhead, whensoeuer it pleased him
in that kinde to manifest the same.
Wherefore to ascribe this vertue to the
Crosse, beeing a creature, or the worke
of a creature, is to communicate the incommunicable
power of the Creator
to it, which is plaine blasphemie.
                  IV. The fourth Remedie, is the vsing
of hallowed things; as hallowed
graines, salt, water, bread, images; specially
the image of Agnus dei.
                  
                  
                     Ans. Hallowed creatures are in truth

vnhallowed superstitions. For euery
creature is sanctified by the word and
prayer, 1. Tim. 4. 4. by the word, when
God in his word commands vs to vse it
for some ende; and by prayer, when we
giue thanks for giuing the creature, and
withall desire his blessing in the vse
thereof. Now let any Papists shew me
one letter or sillable in all the Booke of
God, commanding the vse of a creature
for any such ende.
                  They affirme indeede, that Elisha
wrought miracles by hallowed salt, for
by it he cured the bitter waters, 2. king.
2. 21. But the Prophet vsed not hallowed,
but common salt, and that not ordinarily,
but onely then, as a means wherby
to worke a miracle. It was therefore
powerfull in his hands, because for the
doing thereof, he had power and warrant
from God extraordinarily: and it
cannot be so in any other, which haue
not the same gift.
                  V. The fift and last Remedie, is Exorcisine,
which is an adiuring and commanding
the Deuill in the name of
God to depart from the partie possessed,

and cease to molest him any more.
This meanes was vsed by our Sauiour
Christ himselfe, and after him by his Apostles,
and other beleeuers in the time
of the Primitiue Church, when the gift
of working Miracles was in force: but in
these daies (a
                        •
                      I said before) that gift
is ceased, and also the promise of power
annexed to the vse of adjuration: and
therefore the means thereof must needs
cease. And for an ordinarie man now to
command the Deuill in such sort, is
meere presumption, and a practise of
Sorcerie.
               
               
                  Sect. IV.
                  IV. Quest. Whether the Witches of our
age are to be punished with death, and that by
vertue of this law of Moses?
                  I doubt not, but in this last age of the
world, and among vs also, this sinne of
Witchcraft ought as sharply to be punished
as in former times; and all Witches
beeing thoroughly conuicted by
the Magistrate, ought according to the
Law of Moses to be put to death. For
proofe hereof, consider these reasons.
                  
                     
First, this Law of Moses flatly enioyneth
all men, in all ages, without limitation
of circumstances, not to suffer the
Witch to liue, and hereupon I gather,
that it must stand the same, both now
and for euer to the worlds ende.
                  Patrons of Witches except against
this, holding that it was a Iudiciall law,
which continued but for a time, & concerned
onely the Nation of the Iewes,
and is now ceased. But I take the contrarie
to be the truth, and that vpon
these grounds.
                  I. Those Iudiciall Lawes, whose penaltie
is death, because they haue in thē
a perpetuall equitie, and doe serue to
maintaine some morall precept, are perpetuall.
The Iewes indeede had some
Lawes of this kind, whose punishments
were temporall, and they lasted onely
for a certaine time: but the penaltie of
Witchcraft, beeing Death by Gods appointment,
and the in
                        •
                     licting of that
punishment, seruing to maintaine the
equitie of the three first morall precepts
of the first Table, which cannot be kept,
vnlesse this Lawe be put in execution: it

must necessarily follow, that it is in that
regard morall, and binds vs, and shall in
like sort bind all men in all ages, as well
as the Iewes themselues, to whome it
was at that time personally directed.
                  II. Euery Iudiciall law, that hath in
it the equitie of the law of nature, is perpetuall;
but the Law of punishing the
Witch by death, is such. For it is a principle
of the law of nature, holden for a
grounded truth in all countries & kingdomes,
among all people in euery age;
that the traytour, who is an enemie to
the State, and rebelleth against his lawfull
Prince, should be put to death: now
the most notorious traytour and rebell
that can be, is the Witch. For shee renounceth
God himselfe, the King of
kings, shee leaues the societie of his
Church and people, shee bindeth her
selfe in league with the Deuill: and therfore
if any offender among men, ought
to suffer death for his fact, much more
ought shee, and that of due desert.
                  The second reason for the proofe of
the point in hand, is this; According to
Moses lawe euery Idolater was to be

stoned to death: Deut. 17. 3, 4, 5. If there
be found any among you, that hath gone and
serued other gods, as the Sunne, the Moone,
or any of the hoast of heauen: if the thing vpon
enquirie be found to be true and certen,
thou shalt bring them forth vnto thy gates,
whether it be man or woman, and shalt stone
them with stones till they die. Now this is
the very case of a Witch, shee renounceth
the true God, and maketh choice
to serue the Deuill, shee is therefore a
grosse Idolater, and her punishment
must be suitable. It is alledged by the fauourers
of the contrarie part, that Peter
denied Christ, and yet was not put to
death: I answer, there is great difference
betweene Peters deniall of Christ, and
Witches denying of God. Peters deniall
was vpon infirmitie, and in hast: the
Witch denieth God vpon knowledge,
and deliberation, wittingly and willingly.
Againe, Peter did not vpon the deniall
betake himselfe to the Deuill, but
turned vnto Christ againe, which he testified
by his heartie and speedie repentance:
but Witches denie God, and betake
themselues to the Deuill, of their

own accord, as is manifest euen by their
own confessions at their arraignments.
                  The third reason. Euery seducer in
the Church, whose practise was to draw
men from the true God, to the worship
of Idols, though it were a mans owne
sonne or daughter, wife or friend, by the
peremptorie degree and commandement
of God, was at no hand to be spared
or pitied, but the hand of the witnesse
first, and then the hands of all the
people must be vpon him, to kill him,
Deut. 13. 6. 9. If this be so, no Witches
connicted ought to escape the sword of
the Magistrate: for they are the most
notorious seducers of all other. When
they be once intangled in the Deuills
league, they labour to invre their dearest
f
                        •
                     iends and posteritie, in their cursed
and abominable practi
                        •
                     es; that they
may be the more easily drawne into the
same consederacy, wherewith they thē
                     selues
are vnited to Satan. I might here
alleadge that they deserue death, because
many of them be murtherers, but
I stand not vpon that instance, because
I hold in the generall that Witches are

not to be suffered to liue, though they
doe no hurt either to man or other creatures,
and that by vertue of Moses Law,
onely for their leagues sake, whereby
they become rebells to God, Idolaters,
and seducers, as now hath beene shewed.
Notwithstanding all that hath
beene said, many things are brought
in defence of them, by such as be their
friends and wel
                        •
                     illers.
                  First, it is saide, that the hurt that is
done, comes not from the Witch, but
from the deuill: he deserues the blame,
because it is his worke, and she is not
to die for his sinne. Ans. Let it be granted,
that the Witch is not the author of
the euill that is done, yet shee is a confederate
and partner with the Deuill in
the fact, and so the law takes hold on
her. See it in a familiar comparison. A
companie of men conspire together in
a robberie, by common consent some
stand in open place to espie out the bootie,
and to giue the watchword, others
are set about the passage, priuily to rush
vpon the man, and to spoile him of his
goods. In this case what saith the Law?

The parties that gaue the watchword,
though they did nothing to the man,
yet beeing accessories and abettors to
the robberie by consent, they are
theeues, and liable to condemnation
and exequution, as well as the principalls.
Euen so stands the case with the
Witch. In the working of wonders, and
in all mischieous practises, he or she is
partaker with the deuill by consent of
couenant: the Witch onely vseth the
watchword, in some charme or otherwise,
and doth no more; the deuill vpon
notice giuen by the charme, takes his
opportunitie, and works the mischeife.
He is the principall agent, but the other
yeeldeth helpe, and is rightly liable to
punishment. The reason is, because if
the deuill were not stirred vp, and prouoked
by the Witch, he would neuer do
so much hurt as he doth. He had neuer
appeared in Samuels likenes, had he not
beene solicited by the Witch of Endor.
He would not haue caused counterfeit
serpents and frogges to appeare in Egypt,
but for Ian
                        •
                     es and Iambres, and other
Inchanters. And in this age there

would not in likelihood be so much
hurt & hinderance procured vnto men,
and other creatures by his meanes, but
for the instigation of ill disposed persons,
that haue fellowship and societie
with him.
                  Againe, they obiect, that Witches
conuicted, either repent, or repent not:
If they repent, then God pardoneth
their sinne, and why should not the
Magistrate as well saue their bodies &
let them liue, as God doth their soules.
If they doe not repent, then it is a dangerous
thing for the Magistrate to put
them to death: for by this meanes he
kills the bodie, & casts the soule to hell.
                  
                     Ans. All Witches iudicially & lawfully
conuicted, ought to haue space of
repentance granted vnto them, wherein
they may be instructed and exhorted,
and then afterward executed. For it
is possible for thē to be saued by Gods
mercie, though they haue denied him.
Secondly, the Magistrate must execute
iustice vpon malefactors lawfully conuicted,
whether they repent or not. For
God approoueth the iust execution of

iudgement vpon men, without respect
to their repentance: neither must their
impenitencie hinder the execution of
iustice. When the people of Israel had
committed Idolatrie in worshipping
the golden calfe, Moses did not expect
their repentance, & in the meane while
forbeare the punishment, but he and
the Leuites presently tooke their
swords and slue them, and the Lord approoued
their course of proceeding,
Exod. 32. 28. When Zimri an Israelite
had committed fornication with Cozbi
a Midianitish woman, Phineas in zeale
of Gods glorie executed iudgment vpon
them both without any respect vnto
their repentance, Numb. 25. 8. and is
therefore commended, Psalm. 106. 30.
Warres are a worthie ordinance of
God, and yet no Prince could euer attempt
the same lawfully, if euery souldier
in the field should stay the killing of
his enemie, vpon expectation of his repentance.
And whereas they say, that by
executing an impenitent Witch, the
Magistrate casteth away the soule; we
must know, that the 
                        •
                     nde of execution

by the Magistrate, is not the damnation
of the malefactors soule, but that sinne
might be punished: that others may beware
of the like crimes and offences,
and that the wicked may be taken away
from among Gods people.
                  But some Witches there be that can
not be conuicted of killing any: what
shall become of them? Ans. As the killing
Witch must die by another Lawe,
though he were no Witch: so the healing
and harmelesse Witch must die by
this Law, though he kill not, onely for
couenant made with Satan. For this
must alwaies be remembred, as a conclusion,
that by Witches we vnderstand
not those onely which kill and
torment: but all Diuiners, Charmers,
Iuglers, all VVizzards, commonly called
wise men and wise women; yea, whosoeuer
doe any thing (knowing what they
doe) which cannot be effected by nature
or art; and in the same number we
reckon all good VVitches, which doe
no hurt, but good, which doe not spoile
and destroy, but saue and deliuer. All
these come vnder this sentence of Moses,
                     
because they deny God, and are consederates
with Satan. By the lawes of
England, the thiefe is executed for stealing,
and we thinke it iust and profitable:
but it were a thousand times better
for the land, if all VVi
                        •
                     ches, but specially
the blessing Witch might suffer
death. For the theife by his stealing, and
the hurtfull Inchanter by charming,
bring hinderance and hurt to the bodies
and goods of meni but these are
the right hand of the deuill, by which
he taketh and destroyeth the soules of
men. Men doe commonly hate and
spit at the damnifying Sorcerer, as vnworthie
to liue among them; whereas
the other is so deare vnto them, that
they hold themselues and their country
blessed that haue him among them,
they flie vnto him in necessitie, they
depend vpon him as their God, and by
this meanes, thousands are caried away
to their finall confusion. Death therefore
is the iust and deserued portion of
the good Witch
                  FINIS.
