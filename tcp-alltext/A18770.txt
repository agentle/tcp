               BY the Authors immutable decree, being his last, this booke was destinate to you, and vpō your allowance, to passe for authorised. What he willed, I haue performed. Agreeing in this with the Authors opinion, That the clerest sighted can best iudge of colours. What your experiēce is in this diuine hearbe, al men do

know; and acknowledge you to bee The Souereigne of Tabacco, and for such they do honor you. If I doe not otherwise vse those tearms of skill, & phrases in your commendation, which are commonly accustomed to bee set foorth, to the worthie patrons of mens works, which the Author no doubt would haue done if he had liued: it is for want of knowledge both of art to do it, and of your perfections, which doe merit more than I can giue sufficient testimonie of; only by the report that runneth of your fame, I doe auouch in one word that you are Most-worthie. And for such I do recommend this rare worke of a

most pretious hearbe vnto you. What may either be said for it, or surmised against it, you know right well; and therefore I doe leaue all men to receaue your instruction, and you to Gods mercifull protection.

               GEntle Reader, this discourse of Tabacco being left in my hands by a gentleman who in his owne particuler had seene great triall of the effects thereof, and as well by priuat conference with men of learning, as by the reading of such authors of credit, who haue reported the strange and woonderfull operations thereof, he was mooued to make

knowne vnto all men that which the most part did doubt of, touching the vse & practise thereof, as well in taking the smoke of it with the Pipe, the leafe being drie, as in applieng the greene leafe to the cure of many sores and diseases. What he did vndertake and giue me in charge (as it were by his last Will) I haue put in execution, and published the same, according to the request of the partie deceased. Which I haue done with more willingnesse, being credibly informed by diuers of good credit, that besides the effects reported by the author, of the taking of it with the Pipe; it hath cleered the sight in a knight of great Commaundment and Worship: and cured a gentleman that

long languished of a Consumption. I doubt not but it hath many other strange vertues which are yet vnknowne. But these that are alreadie approoued, I doe recommend vnto thy view and vse; and so do I wish thee all happinesse.
         
      
      
         
            
            THE DESTINCT and seuerall opinions of the late, and best Phisitions that haue written of the nature of TABACCO: Gathered togither for the better assurance, and confirmation of the diuers natures and qualities therof.
            
               IT is an especial note, which I haue obserued in all mine authors, that in respect of curing wounds, cuts, or other harmes (almost whatsoeuer) and in which this hearbe is of vertue to heale, whilest it is yet

greene, that the same naturall operations in it then▪ the verie same are to be had in it, whē it is now dried, according as the Indians of Trinidade vse, in laying it in the shadow, and where no wind or sunne come to draw out the power or vertue in exhalations.
            Indeed it would seeme somewhat much for any man to say, that if the drying of it were acording to the care of them, who here with vs make it their trade to gaine by, that we might attribute so much power to it, being dried after such a maner: but surely I cannot thinke, but that comming from those poore people, where couetousnesse hath not taught the childe to cut his fathers throat for gaine, or to dissemble with any for profit, we may esteeme it either as good as the greene, or at least as that greene

which growes heere in our clime, which reason persuades vs is vnapt to bring fo
                  •
               th the hearbe in hir naturall heat and vertue being so hote, and our soile so cold.
            Another thing I haue much wondered at, wherefore diuers hauing discourst so largely vpon the applying it to vlcers, burninges, wounds, & such like, they haue not longer stayed vppon the reportes which they might make of receiuing it in pipes, as we now vse, vnlesse it be for this, (and indeede I iudge it one of the chiefe causes) that time and experience, which both corrects old and brings forth new things, either had not discouered to those writers the maner of receiuing it as we now vse it, or if they did vse it, yet it had been so little time in practise, as they had not seene those conclusions wrought

wrought by it which we haue, and to say truth, who hath long known it an vsuall thing in this part of the world, to drinke Tabacco? and yet who is he that euer knew it longest and can iustly say, that this or that discommoditie is come to him by it, vnlesse drinking it extreamly, he hath changed the good into a bad effect, since euerie extreme vertue is a vice: and then who will either deeme Tabacco worse since he hath abused it, or not iudge him ill deseruing so good a benefite, that knowes not how to make his profite, hauing so easie a meanes as a moderate receipt.
            And by this meanes I doubt not but some hath both done themselues wrong, wronged vs, and done other iniurie, who (if they had not heard of some whom vnrespectiue drincking had harmed)

would happily haue been soone drawen to vse it for their health, who now remaining feared with examples, shunne it as an inconuenience, which els they had entertained as a publicke good.
            But heere I would not that anie man should thinke I arrogate to my selfe any title of perfection in phisick; far be it from my thoughts that I should interest my selfe vnworthily in that, which by no right I can claime: but Salua reuere

            But to proceed, before I come to mine authors, you shal haue the opinion of a yonger Dr. who loues and hath made as farre trials of drinking Tabacco as any man that is found: who doubts (saith he) but hauing leaues of Tabacco brought from the Indians, and purposelie dried in the shadow, where the working of the sunne nor any otherheat may draw o

               oted, that in this case we are to receiue it in good quantity down, so that it force to cough, and either fetch the corruption off the stomacke, which engenders it, or at least wise drieth it vp, and so takes away the cause.
            For the head-ache, proceeding of any cold or winde▪ experienc

                hath confirmed examples enow, and our owne reasons, if we wanted examples, might be sufficiently strong to persuade vs, that nothing should be more soueraigne.
            Who but entends to watch extraordinarily, I could wish he had but seene some of the same effects which it hath wrought in diuers that would neuer credit it, till they had made triall, onely drinking a pipe full at any time when we find our selues drowsy & would wake.
            
               Who hath euer found a more soueraign remedy against coughs, rheume in the stomacke, head, and eyes? from whence it will fetch the humor in so strange quantity, as in some is admirable.
            There is a certaine kinde of people that speak nothing but ridles, they dwell vnder the hot clime of the still yeard, they are somwhat nosie, and very rich in diuers white and red excrements, called Alebuttons, I could wish that some of them had the wit after a certaine kind of merry assembling, called the Drunkards round, to allay that same distemperat vapour of pure Rhenish, with a draught or two of this Tabacco. There is a reason if they could hit on it, that would persuade wise men, that after they haue been in the land of Tanquam, a little of this downeward,

               
                  〈◊〉
                fetch vp that same that makes them so mad in the brains, and I doubt not but some honest remembrancer or other, will put it into their heads that haunt those prouinces, to vse this receipt when they intend good fellowship, and would hold out.
            But for any direction or order of receiuing it, I will not take away from men of art so much right, as to say directly, you must vse this or that course that which I haue seen most vsed & bringing forth best effect, is to receiue it in the morning fasting; for commonly men which vse it not idely, find that at that time it doth them most ease. And I would not that any should receiue it at any time but when he finds himselfe not well disposed, or beeing well, suspects either that he hath surfaited, or something

which he hath in his stomack, may make him ill.
            I haue found it very excellent and soueraigne▪ beeing tired and weary with iournying too far, but in this the quantety works the experiment, for as a little causeth wakefulnesse, so it beeing taken ouermuch, as sixe or seauen pipes full, it will procure a most profound sleepe; and I haue found it taken away that wearisomnesse in one night, which I haue thought would not haue left me in many daies: and this I put in excecution, to try how that was▪ true that a Spaniard writes of the Indians, who reporteth, that after their trauels and labours, they will drincke vnmeasurably of Tabacco, which (after they had slept) tooke away all wearinesse of body, and makes them as prompt and apt to businesse,

as if they had been many daies without doing any thing, and surely I found it very neare the truth, for the next day, I did perceiue my wearinesse almost vtterly gone, although not quite, which perhaps might be for want of custome, or because my sicknesse before was apt to make me feele that longer than I should haue done beeing well.
            But that I may vse mine opinion, which I will not confirme by any precise comparison, I thinke that those writers which haue so effectually written of the nature of Tabacco, by outward applications both knew the secreat effects of the greene leafe, applying it to wounds, and of the dried leafe receiuing it by pipes: but hearing of so strange a maner of receiuing it, as phisicke was neuer guilty to the

vnderstanding of, they thought it meet to preserue in a perpetuall concealment among themselues, least being knowne to the world, the inhabilitie of other hearbs and deuises being discouered, and this made knowne, it might turne to the common detrement and hurt of their Art; for in reason, why should any man lay open willingly, or suffer another to enter into the secret conceipts and internetie of our knowledge, when such internetie might make it either les prised, or cause a publique cause to receiue a generall disesteeme for a particular occasion. And I doubt not but if an idle Tabacconist, and a hot Phisition were met without a moderator, it would proue a hard question in their naturall reasons, whether hee that first deuised this secret of drinking Tabacco,
               
being a phisition himselfe, (as sur
                  •
               ly I thing he was) was worthy to be accompted a good or an euill person, since he (it is likely) for his owne priuat commodity, did make that knowne to many, by the which many haue receiued more losse of gold in generall, than any of them did receiue good, to whom he did first impart it.
            Well, be he what he will, or what he was, I doubt not but he did a more good deed than hee was aduised of, and therfore deserues in mine opinion to be otherwise requited than according to the quality of his deserts, which if it may be thought infinite in respect of himselfe, then let not him want his due, for it were sin that since so few men deserue well, any of them should cease to good workes, because they want that

respect in which their worth may interest them.
            
            And thus farre for drinking of Tabacco, which is more vulgarly receiued with vs now than euer, and although it seems that the Indians

vse to take this Tabacco in other maner of pipes than we, yet I thinke we shall not need to thinke our earthen or 
                  •••
               ier pipes more vnapt than those which the Indians make of Palme leaues and such like.
            I could stand longer to persuade the world of some wonders that I haue seen effected with one draught of excellent Tabacco, but some that are as hard of beleefe as he that persuaded himselfe a man could not breake his necke with a fall from Paules, if he fell vpon feather beds, I will omit to the oportunity of their owne experience, which I my selfe once trie
                  •
                vpon one that would in kindnesse face me downe that there was no force in such an idle smoke; but of this I could tell you a long story, and I could make you beleeue he

was ready to bewRAY himselfe, and rent his buttons, and breake his points, if not for anger, yet for some thing else that made him afraid of a worse matter.
            But to conclude, I will limit no man to any prescript order of drinking Tabacco, nor wish that any should vse it, but as they finde themselues cold in their stomacke, rheumaticke, or hauing the headache, or for diuers other such necessarie occasions, for I see not how such vnmeasurable drinking should not both harme them that drink it, and wrong others by robbing the world of so singular a treasure as this. I could therefore wish it were a penal law, that whosoeuer should abuse it by vnmeasurable and needlesse drinking, should forfait at the pleasure of his Excelsitude, from three times vpward,

so much as he hath wasted-toward the maintenance of Tabacco in the treasury, and by this means I feare not, but we should make that our singular profit, which we now turne to our disprofit and harme, and that wee should not remaine in that great want of good Tabacco which wee haue done of a long time together, but that hoarding Apothicaries might be glad to abate their prises of their mingle mangle which forsooth they will not sell, vnder vnreasonable rate, when there is scarse good to be got, although that which they haue be as bad at the best, as the worst of but indi
                  ••
               erent good, when good may be bought.
            That which may be said more I refer to the conceit of them that hold it in her due price, for my

selfe in few, I thinke that there is nothing that harmes a man inwardly from his girdle vpward▪ but may be taken away with a moderate vse of Tabacco, and in those parts consist the chiefe reasons of our health, for the stomacke and head being cleare and void of euill humors, commonly the whole body is the better.
            And I will expose the censure herof to many, who I know would proue as aduerse to me in any matter, wherof I should desire their opinon, as to their enemies▪ yet let them say, that can say most to enuy against it, happely some one as wise as a woodcocke will raise his flight on his becke, and crie fie, fie, how it stincks, smell you it not? or tell me he will hire an Irish man to chimney-sweep my stomacke, (for woodcocks are a wise

kinde of wild fooles) but can such fooles, fellowes I meane, tell any discommodity it hath brought, I speake it with an vpright feare to God, I thinke man hath not known an excellenter preseruatiue against the late dangerous infection, than this, and if any one who made vse of it in good order, hath died of the infection, I am truely resolued, that for that one which died, it hath saued threescore, whose esteeme hereof beeing lesse than the merit it selfe, haue preserued themselues by extraordinarily receiuing it amongst company, not for any affection or hope they haue had to fortefie themselues against so dangerous an incident, but by meere power of the hearbe; how many then shall I thinke haue been saued, who knowing in good order to make their profitable vse

therof, haue serued their necessity, and saued their liues?
            Now to come to the second forme of receiuing this hearbe, I haue made choice of three especiall men which write most at large, namely, Charles Stephen, and Iohn Liebault, two Frenchmen, & Aegidius Eurartus: There is likewise Monardes, a Spaniard, who hath written very largely of it, but because he is already translated into English, I will referre that which he hath very large to his owne volume. One cause (notwithstanding) makes me to take an occasion to leaue him, and that is, for that hee is a Spaniard of Siuill, and yet is found to haue gathered some reasons which he hath out of other Authors, and yet reports himselfe to haue been conuersant with the Indians, from whence

               The diuersitie of names giuen to this hearbe.
               THis hearbe with the French hath been most knowne by the name of Nicotiana: the first occasion was, that (as the Greekes, Romans, & others, trauailing to India or other places, wher they found plants, vnknowne cities, or lands, they vsually gaue them their owne names, to remaine in memory to posterity that such an one had done his common wealth that seruice) so Monsieur Nicot a French man, Embassadour to the king of

Portugall, sending this hearbe first into France gaue it his name.
               Others that by tradition haue noted the means from whence they receiued this, haue called it Queene mother hearbe, for that when Monsieur Nicot had sent it commended to her, she first planted it.
               Others haue surnamed it of the great Prior, for that such an one receiuing this hearbe from Lisbone, & hauing first planted it in France, afterward experienst the diuerse vertues & singular natures which he found in it, making it knowne to the world, how much excellent it was: the common people finding it most vsed by him, and nowhere to be found but in his garden, could giue it no distinct title, but would that it should be caled his hearbe.
               
                  Others there want not which cal it Petum Masculine, and yet farre differing in quality and effect, from that the Portugals and Spaniards haue called Petum Feminine, but howsoeuer or wheresoeuer this hath receiued that name, it shall suffice that we remember it to haue been most knowne among the french, by some one of these three names, though now perhaps vse and better knowledge hath made it knowne vnto them, as vnto vs, by the name of Tabacco. But to proceed.
               This Monsieur Nicot, being of the councell of the French king, and by him sent of Embassage to the king of Portugall, whilst he yet was lieger there, wold make often resort to see in the records of that country, what diuersity of matter, strange accidents, or other matter

of note might best fit the memory of a man of his estate▪ among other he found that at such a time this Tabacco had been sent as a present (worthy the gratefullest acceptaunce) from Florida thither, who happily desirous to trie of what trueth a thing of such miracle might be, was by a gentleman (keeper of the Records) presented with a root therof, which he presently planted in his garden, intending to try if the fame of the thing were no greater than the thing it selfe, which soone he found, by an aduenture which happened ere he thought of it, for before himselfe had made triall herof to the particular

into his hand to cure, although happily he might haue had much mony for a little paine: but tould the Embassadour that the force of the disease and poyson was alreadie destroied by the applying of this Tabacco, and so it was indeed, for within very short time, the patient recouered and became very sound and perfectly healed of his sore.
               Afterward, that triall might be made what nature it had in working in other kinde of sores, it fortuned that the Embassadors cooke had most pitifully

               And yet further, to a gentlewoman that had a dart rotten in her face, and was past all cure & care of Surgery, the Embassadour caused to be applied this hearbe, not presuming it were able to heale her (that had no hope left her of better than that which she endured) but desirous to see if it were

possible to be healed with Tabacco, which neither Art nor Phisicke could preuaile with: hoping that at the least if it did no good, yet it could doe no ill; and see, he had not applyed this a fortnight, but the gentlewoman was restored to her health, and the sore became perfectly healed, for which so good hap, the poore gentlewoman would often repaire to the Embassadour, yeelding him infinite thankes for his happy endeuour that turned to so good end.
               There was likewise a Captaine, whose sonne had that mortall and almost incurable desease which we call the Kinges euill, (because thought to be cured by none but the Princes themselues) he often resorted to the Embassador, bringing with him his sonne, to whome Monsieur Nicot ministred this

               The fame and esteeme of Tabacco beeing come into so great request among those of the kinges court, the Embassadour grew with great diligence and regard to note the vertues therof, and as it were to fore-tell vnto himselfe some great woonder of strange import, (such commonly men conceiue when their hopes exceeding ordinarie bounds, affect that, that happely they finde effected, beyond the common course of conceipt) and it was euen about that time, when Monsieur Nico

her death to her graue, sorely vexed with an vlcer ingendred of the perilous and hellish sore which we before spake of, and call Noli me tangere; and that at the same instant the Countesse of Ruffe hauing her face perished with a dart, (the like whereof we had also before) and she hauing now long time had the counsell and often aduises of the best Phisitions that France could affoord, which you may thinke a Ladie of such high esteeme would trie to the highest straine ere she would die, if Phisick might saue her, and that be had for any mony; but when those had left her, and she remained alone left to her last fortune, she vsed of this hearbe, and was cured; for it was not long after that king Frances the second, as likewise the queen mother, had receiued roots

               Other experiences hereof were made by the lord of Iarwicke gouerner of Rochel, who in a solempne feast made open report at the queen mothers table, to M. Nicot how he had distilled this Tabacco with an 
                     •
                  ther little hearb or weed, which he found in the woods, and had therby cured one extreamlie pained with the dsease called Asmaticke, the nature of which disease is, to stop the passage of the wind, and make vs breath vneasily.
               This hearbe in fourme much resembleth Consonde, and is of so neer a likenesse and resemblance, that you would iudge it to be the greater Consond.
               
                  
                  
               
               
                  
                  The maine stalke of Tabacco groweth vpright, & big in proportion, his leaues are velueted, and are in growth bigger and larger at the stalke than towards the end of the leafe, resembling the plaine fourme of any other leafe not ragged, saue that you shall haue some leaues broader and larger than both your hands, and in length as much as three hands breadth.
               Some you shall haue growing very high, somtimes to the heigth of nine or ten foote, yea somtimes a cubit, but that fortunes according to the ordering of it when it is sowne.
               The leaues somtimes grow halfe a foot distant the one from the other, if it hath any great heigth.
               The floure of the Tabacco is much like the floure of Niel, sometimes yellow, and somtimes of a

carnation colour, and som
                     •
                  times in fourme like a bell.
               And when it casteth the flower, it leaues the former proportion, and taketh the semblance of an apple, in which you may finde the seeds inclosed very small, appearing not much vnlike to Iusquiasm seedes, which are yellowish: but when they grow to be toward their full ripenesse, then they appeare more neare to a blacke. In those regions from whence we receiued first the knowledge hereof, Tabacco hath both floure, seed, and leafe, at one instant, but the reason is, those countries of the Indians are better and apter to bring forth sooner such hot hearbes than a cold climate. In the nine or tenth month it springeth very much at the foot, for then is the roote fastned into the ground with a great

sort of very weake strings.
               Who would make experiment of the greene leafe, to apply it to any vlcer, sore, or cut, shall in brusing of it finde a iuice thicke and slimie, but in the smell it is indifferentlie well sauoring, although such as haue no vse of the smell would iudge it strong and noisom, in tast it is somewhat biting, it is drie in the first degree, and whosoeuer would haue it good, should doe wel to sow it in the hottest and most fertill ground, for such it requireth.
               The best place wherin it will most prosper and be naturally planted in our countries, is where the sunne shineth most, and if it be possible against some wall which may defend it from the North winde, which is an infinite enemy to this hearbe, and withall it were

conuenient that no winde at all, beeing ouer rigourous, should come neere it, for the weakenesse of the stalke caused by the high growth of the hearbe, is such, that a small winde will blow it downe, vnlesse happily it be deeply rooted. If the weather be ouer drie, it will desire much watering. Cold kils this, and therefore all means are to be vsed against it.
               Who would sow it, ought by the opinion of the best skild in Phisicke, to take this order, first take a dosen seeds of those which you finde inclosed in that part of the seede which resembleth the bell, and put them togither into one hole, about three inches deep in the ground, and the cause why you are to plant it deepe is because the seeds be very small and little, and might be choaked.

If the weather be ouer drie, you shall doe well to water it fifteene daies together. It may be sowne in manner like the hearbe Laistich, whose seeds are mingled with earth or sand.
               It will seeme long ere it appeare aboue ground, but that will be according to the nature of the ground, and yet euen then it will be longer than many other seedes, but immediatly as soone as you see it begin to spring, you shall couer it as much as you can conueniently, least that frosts, or cold, or tempestious raine, nip it away, or wash it downe; and after conuenient time of growth, you shall take it vp by the roote, cutting vp the ground round about, so that there may none of the strings of the roote be broken, which to preuent, you may very wel wash away

the earth with water, and then replant it again, neer some wal, within two or three foot, but if the ground be not good there, (as commonly it may happen) then prepare with apte manuring it.
               For the time of sowing it in England I agree rather with Monardes than these two, who say it is best sowing it in the midst of Aprill, but I would rather hold it better to sow it in March, for the same occasion that Monardes writeth, howbeit Stephen and Liebault write that the Spaniards and Indians sow it after haruest.
               It is hot and drie in the second degree, and therfore fit vndoubtedly to purge and clense, by experience (they affirme) it hath healed Noli me tangere, so named because it resembleth I thinke a curst shrew that must not be toucht

when shee is angry.
               It hath healed the disease called the Wolfe, the Canker, the kings euill, all old sores, wounds, 
                     •
                  etters, broad biles, Apostumes, pricking of the fish called Viues, (the nature of whose touch is to procure infinite bleeding euen to death) and diuerse other diseases, which experience hath not yet brought to light.
               These men affirme that who so hath the gout, and when the extreamitie of the paine beginneth, rubbeth the infected place with oyle Oliue, and afterwards apply warme leaues of Tabacco, shall find great ease.
               Who taketh the leaues and seeths them in water, and maketh thereof a sirupe with sugar, and receiueth of it euerie morning to the quantitie of two ownces, shall

finde how much power it hath to dissolue grosse humors, to ease the hard drawing of the breath, breake an old cough or fleume, & how it causeth dissolution of hard swellings in the body, if before the receipt heerof we receiue some vniuersall purge, and then the iuice of the leaues vnstop the kidney, and softneth the hardnesse by being onely applied vnto the region of the kidny: and in case we want of the leaues, the pouder mingled with any ointment proper to such an euill, is auailable. The same means auaileth in coldnesse of the stomacke, the bellie, the collique, and the inward partes, being applied to the Nauil.
               They affirme that in France a man hauing a sore vlcer, or impostume, caused by the euil of naples, that we cal in English the French

something, was immediatly cured therof.
               It is a singular remedie against soundings, to receiue the smoke as we vse with pipes; & that which is more strange than the world wold credit, the inhabitants of Florida often nourish themselues four or fiue daies together by the smoke, neither eating nor drinking any thing whatsoeuer, and this is most certainly confirmed by that which he writeth.
               More than this writeth Liebault, that there are which distill water of the green leaues of Tabacco in a Limbecke of glasse, which water is no lesse singular in all effects, than the very iuice, helping all wounds, sores, and bruses, euen restoring to men which by some aduenture haue lost their nailes, new ones, by washing that part

with the water destilled, and afterward wrapping them vp in fine linnen clothes, dipt in the water.
               Some there are also who (to speake like a Chimist) doe distill oyle of Tabacco, per descensum, which oile, these authors (agreing with the Paracelsians) preferre before all other applications, either of leaues, iuice, or pouder, because the quintescences and extractions drawne out of the simples, are the subtill spirit, and haue the purest vertue and facultie of the substance from the which they are drawne.
               They prescribe vnto vs this kinde of receipt, Take of the choisest and most substantial leaues of this Tabacco one pound, beat them in a morter of Marble, after take halfe a pound of sweet hogs grease, refind and clarified, without salt,

and this being melted, ad to it the Tabacco, and set it ouer a soft fire to seeth deliberatly, vntill such time as you finde the waterish humour of the Tabacco vapoured away, and that the mingled substances retaine the fourme of a perfect ointment, this reserue for a singular and medicinable good.
               Another is this, Take Rosel, new wax, and turpentine, of each three ounces, melt them togither, and then adde vnto them a pound of Tabacco prepared as before, mingle them togither, and after with a slow fire set them to incorporat, seething togither fiue or sixe howers, vntill the water of the Tabacco be cleane vapoured away, after this is done, straine it through a course linnen cloath, that may be very strong: afterward take halfe a pound of Venice Turpentine,

and infuse it into these thinges beforesaid, without any more boyling of it, but stirring it continually vntill it be cold, afterwards preserue these as pretious ointments: touching their effects; the first of these two is the better for sores, vlcers, carbuncles, tetters, and to dissolue, than the second, because Tabacco hath so much the more efficacy, by how much there are fewer commixions. The second is better than the first, to consolidate any wound, dissolue impostumes and swellings, & to appease their rage.
               Further you may make a singular Baulme, by cutting greene leaues of Tabacco and putting them into a glasse well stopt, if you set it a good time in hot water, or in the sunne, or buried in Ventre equino, by the space of fortie daies, and doubtlesse you shal finde so singular

a baulme as shal not be lesse admirable (say mine authours) than that oile which is made by the Paracelsians for all kind of vses that shall be desired in a hearbe of that nature.
               
                  AeGidius Eurartus in his discourse De herba Panacaea, writeth, how a certaine woman had giuen her cat a very strong poyson, when the poore cat was now in that taking that she could not stand with dissinesse, and striued to void forth the poison in vaine, the woman remēbring her selfe, found means to open her iawes, and making a little ball of brused Tabacco, mingled with butter, thrust it into hir mouth, and so swallowing it downe, within a short time shee cast vp all the poison and so was saued.

                   wils that we should gather the leaues in the moneth of Iuly, and then bruse and distill them in a double Limbecke, with two spouts of glasse, and keepe this a yeare, for (saith he) this receiued to the quantitie of an ounce, for the increasing of health in a sicke stomacke, is most effectuall.
               There is likewise a Salt and an Oile to be made of Tabacco, both of them more singular and effectuall for all diseases, than either the leaues, or iuice, or water, which the Paracelsians and Chimists generally agree in, because they will that in this oyle should be contained the true life and naturall vertue in greater substance and better qualitie than any of the other.
               
                  Iacobus Gohorius a Parisien, teacheth vs this maner of making of the Salt. First (saith he) calcine this

                  Tabacco, and afterward dissolue it; poure it into a pipkin, and let it vapour according to reason, this shalbe singular for vlcers, and such like, and this is the maner of drawing salt out of all vegitable things, burne your hearbe first in the fire, (yet some vse to drie it in the shadow) but being euen burnt to ashes, you haue the more salt; afterward taking a leaden vessell full of most pure cleare water, infuse these ashes, which being set to the fire, let it boile some quantitie, and then poure it into an other vessell, where receiuing it in a clean cloth, let it hang a while by the fire, that the water may drie it selfe cleane away, and not to haue any moisture remaining, and in this cloath being so drie, shall you find that Salt.
               Another maner is this, take the

hearbe being dried, and put it into a close pipkin, vnder which you shall make fire, vntil it be burnt into a fine white ashe, then let it boile in raine water, or distilled water, vntill the fourth part be cōsumed, then let it stand a while, and after poure it into an other vessell, which shall be full of pure and cleare water, and that which shall goe out of the pipkin, euaporat with a slow fire into a glas-bottle, and the Salt shal remaine in the bottome.
