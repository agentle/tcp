            THE TRIVMPHS OF Integrity, or a Noble Solemnity through the City.
            
               OF all Solemnities, by which the Happy inauguration of a Subiect is celebrated, I find none that tranſcends the State and Magnificence of that Pompe prepared to receiue his Maieſties Great Subſtitute into his Honorable charge, (the City of London,) Dignified by the Title of the Kings Chamber Royall, which that it may now appeare no leſſe hightned with Brotherly Affection, Colt, Art, or Inuention, then ſome other praeceeding Triumphs (by which of late times, the Cities Honor hath beene more faithfully illuſtrated) this takes it's fit occaſion to preſent it ſelfe.
            And firſt to ſpecifie the loue of his Noble Fraternity after his Lordſhippes returne from Weſtminſter, hauing receiued ſome ſeruice vpon

the water, by a proper and ſignificant Maiſter-peece of Triumph, called the Imperiall Canopy, being the Antient Armes of the Company, an Invention neither old, nor enforſt, the ſame Glorious and Apt Property, accompanied with foure other Triumphall Pegmes, are in their conuenient Stages planted to honor his Lordſhips progreſſe through the City; the firſt for the land, attending his moſt wiſhed ariuall in Pauls-Church-yard, which beares the inſcription of a Mount Royall, on which Mount are plac't certaine Kings and great Commanders, which Antient Hiſtory produces, that were originally ſprung from Shepheards, and humble beginnings; onely the number of Six preſented, ſome with Crownes, ſome with gilt Laurels, holding in their hands ſiluer Sheephookes, viz. Viriat, a prime Commander of the Portugals, renowned amongſt the Hiſtorians, eſpecially the Romans, who in battailes of 14 yeares continuance, purchaſed many great and honorable victories; Arſaces King of the Parthians, who ordained the firſt Kingdome that euer was amongſt them, and in the reuerence of this Kings Name and memory, all others His Succeſſors were called Arſacides after his Name, as the Roman Emperours tooke the Name of Caeſar,
               
for the loue of Great Caeſar Auguſtus; Alſo Marcus Iulius Lucinus, Bohemiaes Primiſlaus, the Emperour Pertinax, the Great Victor Tamburlayne, Conqueror of Syria, Armenia, Babilon, Meſapotamia, Scythia, Albania, &c. Many Honorable Worthies more I could produce; By their deſerts enobling their meane Originals. But for the better expreſſion of the purpoſe in Hand, a Speaker lends a voyce to theſe followings words!
            
               The Speech in the Mount Royall.
               THey that with Glory-enflamde hearts; deſire
               To ſee Great Worth deſeruingly aſpire,
               Let e'm draw neere and fixe a ſerious Eye,
               On this Tryumphant Mount of Royaltye;
               Here they ſhall finde faire Vertue and her Name,
               From low-obſcure Beginnings rayſde to Fame,
               Like Light ſtruck out of Darknes; the meane wombes
               No more Eclipſe braue Merit, then rich Toombes
               Make the Soule happy; 'tis the Life, and Dying
               Crownes both with Honors Sacred Satiſfying;
               And 'tis the Nobleſt Splendor vpon Earth,
               For man to adde a Glory to his Birth
               (All his Lifes Race with honor'd Acts commixt)
               Then to be Nobly-borne and there ſtand fixt;
               
                  As if 'twere Competent Vertue for whole Life
               To be Begot a Lord; 'tis vertuous Strife
               That makes the compleate Chriſtian; not high Place,
               As true Submiſſion is the State of Grace,
               "The Path to Blisse, lyes in the humbleſt Feild,
               "Who euer riſe to Heauen that neuer kneeld,
               Although the Roofe hath Supernaturall Height,
               Yet there's no Fleſh can thither goe vpright:
               All this is inſtanc'ſt onely to commend,
               The low condition whence theſe Kings deſcend;
               I ſpare the Dauid. Prince of Prophets in this File,
               And preſerue him for a farre Holier Stile,
               Who being King Annoynted, did not ſcorne
               To be a Shepheard after; theſe were borne
               Shepheards, and riſe to Kings, tooke their aſcending
               From the ſtrong hand of Vertue, neuer ending
               Where Shee begins to rayſe, vntill ſhee place
               Her Loue ſicke Seruants equall with her Grace;
               And by this Dayes great Honor it appeares
               Sh' as much preuaylde amongſt the Reuerend yeares
               Of theſe Graue Senators, chiefe of the reſt
               Her Fauour hath reflected moſt and beſt,
               Vpon that Sonne whom wee of Honor call,
               And may' t Succeſſiuely reflect on all.
            
            From this Mount Royall beautified with the Glory of deſeruing Aſpirers, deſcend we to the

Moderne vſe of this Antient and Honorable Miſtery, and there we ſhall finde the whole Liuery of this moſt renowned and famous City, as vpon this Day, and at all Solemne meetings, furniſhed by it; it clothes the Honorable Senators in their higheſt and richeſt Wearings, all Courts of Iuſtice, Magiſtrates, and Iudges of the Land.
            By this time his Lordſhip, and the Worthy Company being gracefully conducted toward the little Conduit in Cheape, there another part of the Triumph waytes his Honors happy approach, being a Chariot Artfully framde, and properly garniſhed; And on the Conſpicuous part thereof is plac'ſt the Regiſter of all Heroicke Acts and worthy Men, bearing the Title of Sacred Memory, who for the greater Fame of this Honorable Fraternity preſents the Neuer-dying Names of many memorable and remarkable Worthies of this Antient Society, ſuch as were the Famous for State and Gouernment, Sir Henry Fitz-alwin Knight, who held the Seate of Magiſtracy in this City twenty foure yeares together, He ſits figured vnder the Perſon of Gouernment: Sir Iohn Norman, tho firſt Lord Maior rowed in Barge to Weſtminſter with ſiluer Oares at his owne coſt and charges; vnder

               
                  •
               he perſon of Honor, the Valiant Sir Francis Drake, that rich Ornament to Memory, (who in two yeares and ten moneths ſpace did caſt a girdle about the world) vnder the perſon of Victory, Sir Simon Eyre, (who at his owne coſt built Leaden Hall, a Granary for the Poore,) vnder the figure of Charity, Sir Richard Champion, and Sir Iohn Milborne, vnder the perſon of Munificenee or Bounty, Sir Richard Hardell, and Sir Iohn Poultney, the one in the ſeate of Magiſtracy ſixe yeares, the other foure yeares together, vnder the figures of Iuſtice, and Piety, That Sir Iohn being a Colledge-Founder, in the Pariſh of St. Lawrence Poultney, by Candle-wick ſtreete; & fic de caeteris. This Chariot drawne by two pellited Lyons, being the proper Supporters of the Companies Armes, thoſe two vpon the Lyons preſenting Power and Honor, the one in a little Streamer or Banneret bearing the Lord Maiors Armes, the other the Companies.
            
               The Speech, in the Chariot.
               
                  I Am all Memory, and me thinkes I ſee
               Into the fardeſt Time, Act, Quality;
               As cleere as if 'twere now begun agen,
               The Natures, Diſpoſitions, and the Men;
               
                  I finde to Godneſſe they bent all their powers,
               Which very Name makes bluſhing Times of ours;
               They heapt vp Vertues, long before they were old,
               This Age fits laughing vpon Heapes of Gold,
               We by great Buildings ſtriue to rayſe our Names,
               But they more truely wiſe built vp their Fames,
               Erected faire Examples, large and hie,
               Patternes for vs to build our Honors by;
               For inſtance onely Memory relates,
               The Nobleſt of all City-Magiſtrates,
               Famous Fitz-alwin, naming him alone,
               I ſumme vp twenty foure Lord Maiors in one,
               For He by free election and conſent
               Fild all thoſe yeares with vertuous Gouerment;
               Cuſtome and Time requiring now but one,
               How ought that yeare to be well dwelt vpon,
               It ſhould appeare an Abſtract of that worth,
               Which former Times in many yeares brought forth,
               Through all the life of Man, this is the yeare,
               Which many wiſh, and neuer can come neare,
               Thinke and giue thanks; to whom this yeare do's come,
               The Greateſt Subject's made in Chriſtendome;
               This is the yeare for whom ſome long preparde,
               And others haue their glorious Fortune ſharde,
               But ſerious in thankſgiuing, 'tis a yeare,
               To which all Vertues like the people heere
               
                  Should throng and cleaue together, for the Place
               Is a fit Match for the whole Stocke of Grace;
               And as men gather wealth, 'gainſt the Yeare comes,
               So ſhould they gather Goodneſſe with their Summes,
               For 'tis not ſhowes, Pompe, nor a Houſe of State
               Curiouſly deckt, that makes a Magiſtrate,
               'Tis his faire Noble ſoule, his Wiſedome, Care,
               His vpright Iuſtnes to the Oath he ſware
               Giues him compleate; when ſuch a Man to mee,
               Spreads his Armes open, there my Pallace bee,
               He's both an Honor to the Day ſo grac'ſt,
               And to his Brother-hoods loue that ſees him plac'ſt,
               And in his faire Deportment there reuiues,
               The Antient Fame of all his Brothers Liues.
            
            After this, for the full cloſe of the Fore-noones Triumph, neere St. Lawrence-lane, his Lordſhip Receiues an Entertainment from an vnparaleld Maiſter-peece of Art, called the Criſtall Sanctuary, ſtilde by the name of the Temple of Integrity, where her Immaculate ſelfe with all her glorious and Sanctimonious Concomitants ſit tranſparently ſeene through the Cryſtall; and more to expreſſe the Inuention, & the Art of the Engineer, as alſo for Motion, Variet
                  •
               , and the content of the Spectators, this Cryſtall Temple
               
is made to open in many parts, at fit and conuenient Times, and vppon occaſion of the Speech; the Columnes or Pillars of this Criſtall Sanctuary, are Gold, the Battlements Siluer, the whole Fabrick for the Night Triumph adorned and beautified with many Lights, diſperſing their glorious Radiances on all ſides thorough the Criſtall.
            
            
               The Speech from the Sanctuary.
               HAue you a minde thicke Multitude to ſee
               A Vertue, neere concernes Magiſtracy,
               Here on my Temple throw your greedy eyes,
               See me, and learne to know me, then y' are wiſe;
               Looke, and looke through me, I no fauour craue,
               Nor keepe I hid the Goodneſſe you ſhould haue,
               Tis all tranſparent what I thinke or do,
               And with one looke your Eye may pierce me through,
               There's no diſguiſe, or hypocriticke vaile,
               (Vſde by adulterous Beauty ſet to ſale)
               Spread o're my actions, for reſpect or feare,
               Onely a Criſtall which approues me cleare;
               Would you deſire my Name? Integritie,
               
               One that is ouer what ſhe ſeemes to be,
               
                  So manifeſt, perſpicuous, plaine, and cleere
               You may ee'n ſee my thoughts as they ſit here,
               I thinke vpon faire Equity and Truth,
               
               And there they ſit crownde with eternall Youth,
               I fixe my Cogitations vpon Loue,
               Peace, Meeknes, and thoſe thoughts come from aboue,
               The Temple of an vpright Magiſtrate,
               Is my faire Sanctuary, Throne, and State;
               And as I dare Detractions euilleſt Eye,
               Sore at the ſight of Goodneſſe, to eſpie
               Into my wayes and actions, which lie ope
               To euery cenſure, arm'd with a ſtrong Hope:
               So of Your part ought nothing to be done,
               But what the enuious Eie might looke vpon:
               As Thou art Eminent, ſo muſt thy Acts
               Be all Tralucent, and leaue worthy Tracts
               For future times to finde, thy very Breſt
               Tranſparent, like this Place wherein I reſt:
               Vaine doubtings; al thy Daies haue bin ſo cleare
               Neuer came Nobler Hope to fill a yeare.
            
            At the cloſe of this Speech, this Criſtall Temple of Integritie with all her caeleſtiall Concomitants, and the other parts of Triumph take leaue of his Lordſhip for that time, and reſt from

ſeruice til the great Feaſt be ended, after which the whole Body of the Triumph attends vpon his Honor, both toward St. Paules, and homeward, his Lordſhip accompanied with the Graue and Honorable Senators of the City; amongſt whom the two worthy Conſulls, his Lordſhips Graue-Aſſiſtants for the yeare, the worſhipfull and Generous, Mr. Raph Freeman, and Mr. Thomas Moulſon, Sheriffes and Aldermen, ought not to paſſe of my reſpect vnremembred; whoſe Bounty and Nobleneſſe will prooue beſt their owne Expreſſers.
            Neere the entrance of woodſtreete, that part of Triumph being planted to which the concluding Speech hath chiefly reference, and the reſt, about the Croſſe, I thought fit in this place to giue this it's full Illuſtration; It being an Inuention both glorious and proper to the Company, bearing the name of the thrice Royall Canopie of State, being the honored Armes of this Fraternity, the three Imperiall Crownes caſt into the Forme and Bigneſſe of a Triumphall Pageant, with Cloude and Sun-beames, thoſe Beames by Enginous Art made often to mount and ſpred like a Golden and Glorious Canopy ouer the Deified perſons that are plac'ſt vnder it,

which are eight in number, figuring the eight Beatitudes, To improoue with conceite, Beati Pacifici, being the Kings word or Motto, is ſet in faire great Letters, neare the vppermoſt of the three Crownes; and as in all great Edifices or Buildings, the Kings Armes is eſpecially remembred, as a Honor to the Building and Builder in the Frontiſpice: ſo is it comely and requiſite in theſe matters of Triumph framed for the Inauguration of his great Subſtitute, the Lord Maior of London, that ſome remembrance of Honour ſhould reflect vpon his Maieſty, by whoſe peacefull Gouernment vnder Heauen we enjoy the Solemnity!
            
               The ſpeech, hauing Reference to this Imperiall Canopy, being the Drapers Armes.
               THe Bleſſedneſſe, Peace, Honor, and Renowne,
               This Kingdome do's enioy vnder the Crowne,
               Worne by that Royall Peace-maker, our King,
               (So oft preſerude from Dangers menacing)
               Makes this Armes, (glorious in it ſelfe) outgoe
               All that Antiquity could euer ſhowe,
               And thy Fraternity hath ſtriude t' appeare
               In all their courſe, worthy the Armes they beare,
               
                  Thrice haue They Crown'd their Goodnes this one Day
               With Loue, with Care, with Coſt; by which they may
               By their Deſerts moſt iustly theſe Armes claime,
               Got once by Worth, now Trebly held by Fame:
               Shall I bring Honor to a larger Feild,
               And ſhow what Royall Buſineſſe theſe Armes yeild?
               Firſt the three Crownes affords a Diuine ſcope,
               Set for the Graces, Charity, Faith, and Hope;
               
               Which Three the onely ſafe Combiners be,
               Of Kingdomes, Crownes, and euery Company;
               Likewiſe with iuſt propriety they may ſtand
               For thoſe three Kingdomes ſwaide by the meek Hand
               Of Bleſt Iames; England, Scotland, Ireland,
               
               The Cloud that ſwells beneath e'm, may imply
               Some Enuious Miſt caſt forth by Hereſie,
               Which through his happy Raigne, and Heauens bleſt will;
               The sun-beames of the Goſpell ſtrikes through ſtill;
               More to aſſure it to Succeeding Men,
               We haue the Crowne of Brittaines Hope agen,
               (Illuſtrious Charles our Prince,) which all will ſay,
               Addes the chiefe Ioy and Honor to this Day:
               And as three Crownes, three Fruites of Brotherhood
               By which all Loues Worth may be vnderſtood,
               So threefold Honor makes the Royall Sute
               In the King, Prince, and the Kings Subſtitute:
               
                  By th' eight Beatitudes, Yee vnderſtand
               The Fulneſſe of all Blessings to this Land,
               More chiefly to this City, whoſe ſafe Peace
               Good Angels guard, and Goodmens prayers encreaſe:
               May all ſucceeding-Honor'd Brothers bee,
               With as much Loue brought Home, as Thine brings Thee.
            
         
      
      
         
            FOr all the Proper Adornments of Arte and Workmanſhip in ſo ſhort a Time, ſo gracefully ſetting forth the Bodie of ſo Magnificent a Triumph, the prayſe comes as a iuſt due to the Exquiſit Deſeruings of Mr. Garret Criſmas, whoſe faithfull performances ſtill take the vpper hand of his promiſes.
            FINIS.
