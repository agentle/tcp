                  ¶ To the right worſhipfull Sir Edward Montegue Knight, Leonard Maſcall wiſheth increaſe of worſhip, to the honor of God, and the benefit of the common wealth.
                  
                     IT is written in hiſtories (Right Worſhipfull) that the ſonnes of Seth and Seneca, or ſome other zealous Philoſophers, being deſirous to leaue ſome thing woorth memorie vnto their poſterities. Did make two pillars, one of braſſe, and another of earth, wherein were grauen the principles of the ſeuen ſciences, to the end their ſucceſſours ſhould vnderſtand the good wils of their predeceſſours: whereby they did ſet forth and ſhew all ſuch good knowledge and learning, as they had found out in their time, to the furtherance of their common wealth. So likewiſe now, things neceſſarie for the ſame, ought not to bee deferd, nor lightly regarded, or forgotten. And wheras the delights of people are of diuers kinds, the ſame is perceiued by their doings: But as touching their delights, thoſe ought chiefely to be regarded which profit moſt the common wealth. As (among the reſt) the gouernment and preſeruation of cattell, and ſuch like: wherein (for lacke of knowledge) oft times the poore man looſeth his beaſt. Alſo I haue knowne that the diſeaſed cattell, of wealthie yeomen, and other poore men ſometimes haue all periſhed, whereby the whole pariſheshaue bene impoueriſhed therby: which thing hath bene a great loſſe vnto ſuch townes, and alſo hinderances vnto the common wealth. Marcus Tullius Cicero, was euer deſirous to further his countrie and common wealth, and ſaid, that daie was euill ſpent, that he did not therein do good, to his common wealth: I would it were ſo now. Euen ſo likewiſe our

predeceſſours, Ariſtotle, Virgill, Plato, and many other in giuing vs examples therein, haue left immortall fame behind them in writing, through the good zeale and loue they had to their countrie and common wealth. Which thing likewiſe (Right worſhipfull) hath moued me of long time to gather and put in writing the doings of diuers and ſundrie perſons, as wel ſtrangers as of our owne countrie men, to ſhew the helpes for moſt diſeaſes in cattell. And for as much as I am enformed your worſhip is deſirous to know and vnderſtand of the gouernment of cattell, and of the fatting of Oxen, to the intent to ſhewe the good will I beare to further therein, I thought good to ſet forth the practiſes of many men, how to helpe cattell diſeaſed: which thing ought not to be kept ſecret for the lucar of a few, but rather I do communicate this my labour to him that hath delight therein. If anie thinke not well hereof, or deſpiſe this my trauell, I will frendly deſire them with theſe wordes: Quod meliora noſti, candidus imparti ſi non, his vtere mecum. VVhich is: If you know anie better how to mend it, of your courteſie impart it, if not, take part of this with me. Thus I leaue to trouble your worſhip anie further, deſiring you to beare with this my plaine and rude ſtile, and to be the defender thereof in print, and in ſo doing, I ſhal thinke my trauell well beſtowed, my paines much lightned, and my good will well recompenced.

                  To the Reader.
                  WHen I had gathered and collctted (gentle Reader) certaine medicines how for to helpe cattel and to gouerne them. I conſidered what benefit, and profit it might bee to my countrie and common wealth, ſpecially vnto the huſband men, and ſuch as haue the gouernment of Oxen, Horſes, Shéep, and ſuch other cattell. For oft times for want of knowledge, many cattell being ſicke, do periſh and die: Where as ſickenes and hurts are accident vnto man diuers waies, euen ſo it chaunceth vnto cattell. Whereupon I thought it good to take occaſion for the loue of my countrie and common wealth, to write ſomewhat, partly of the gouernment for our moſt vſed cattell, as oxen, kine, calues, horſes, ſhéepe, hogs, and ſuch: with diuers approued remedies for them. Plainely and perfectly ſet forth, as well to bee vnderſtood of the vnlearned huſband man, as of the learned gentle man: ſhewing ſomewhat moreouer for the bones ſetting in a beaſt: Declaring likewiſe the order and nature of hogs, with the vſe of dogs, and the cauſe of their madnes, with certaine helpes againſt the bitten cattell, and alſo to help mangie dogs, with diuers approued waies to take moules in any kind of ground. Which thing ye ſhall finde out in the tables of the ſame by alphabet and number, deuided into three bookes. Truſting (gentle Reader) thou wilt take all in good part, as is ment of the author hereof.

                     How for to helpe thy ſickly beaſt,
                     To ſatisfy thy mind.
                     Here maieſt thou learne plentie thereof,

                     Such helpes to helpe their woe.
                     And when thou wouldſt faine cattell keepe,
                     For to maintaine thy ſtocke:
                     Thou muſt then learne as well the helpes
                     As to increaſe the flocke.
                     For if thou ſeekeſt firſt the beaſt,
                     And knowſt not how to vſe him:
                     When he fal'th ſicke, alwaies thou art,
                     In danger for to looſe him.
                     For want of knowledge and good skill,
                     Oft times it maie ſo fall:
                     A man that is full rich in beaſts,
                     He maie ſoone looſe them all.
                     Therefore in this I councell thee,
                     Seeke firſt to helpe diſeaſe:
                     As great a praife to him that ſaues,
                     As he that can increaſe.

                  What knowledge a man ought to haue that vſeth to buy and ſell oxen.
                  
                  
                     I May not eaſily, nor will ſaie all that a man ought to followe or to auoyde in buying of Oxen. But yée ſhall this vnderſtand, oxen are according to the region and countrie where they are bred, for as there is diuerſitie of grounds and countries, ſo likewiſe there is diuerſities of bodies, and diuerſities of natural courage. And likewiſe diuerſity in haire and horne of them. For thoſe Oxen in Aſia, be of one ſort, and thoſe in France of another ſorte: ſo likewiſe héere in Englande of another ſort. And yet not ſo many diuerſities of Prouinces, but as many diuerſities in the beaſtes, as in Italie, in Capam, there they haue white Oxen, and ſmall of body, yet very good to labour in the plough and till the ground. Alſo in the Dutchie of Vrben there are great oxen both white and red, mighty of body and of a great courage. In Tuſcane and about Rome, the oxen are well ſet and thicke and ſtrong made to labour. Likewiſe in the Alpes, and hilles of Burgony they be ſtrong and can; well endure all labour, & fayre like wiſe withall. But neuer the leſſe although they do thus differ ſo in diuers partes, yet the buyer ſhall marke and vnderſtand heere in certaine generall rules of oxen, the which Mago of Carthage hath giuen vs, and ſaith, he that Buying oxen and his properties. will buye oxen muſt buye young oxen, well quartered, hauing large and bigge members, with long hornes ſomewhat blacke, ſtrong and bigge, his foorehead broade, and his browes wrinckled: his eares rough within, and hayrie like veluet, his eyes great and large, his monzell blacke, his noſtrilles croofted, wrythen and very open and wide, the chinne of his necke long, thicke, and fleſhie, the dewlappe or ſkinne that hangeth vnder his throate, to be great in hanging almoſt downe to his knées, his breaſt rounde

and bigge, his ſhoulders large and déepe. His belly bigge compaſſe in falling déepe, his ribbes to be wide and open, his raines large, his backe ſtreight and flat, with a little bending toward the rumpe, his thighes round, his legges ſtreight and well truſt, rather ſomewhat ſhort than long: his knées full and round truſt, his hoofes or clawes on his féete to be large and broade vnder foote, his tayle long, and well hayred, and to be briefe, his body to be thicke & ſhorte, his colour to be redde or blacke is beſt, alſo to be gentle and eaſe to handle and touch, to leade or to occupy. Theſe are the chiefeſt properties (if a man would buy,) to know a good oxe by, and here ſhall followe the beſt way how for to tame them.
               
               
                  The manner and way beſt for a man to tame his oxen.
                  FIrſt to vſe it beſt is this, yée ſhall vſe to handle your Oxen, and touch them when they are young bullockes and calues, and alſo vſe to tye them and to binds them to the ſtall, ſo that hereafter it ſhall not be paynfull vnto you to tame them, nor yet ſo daungerous to bruiſe them as when they wexe olde, and yet I woulde not haue them to be tamed, not before thrée yéeres, nor after fiue yeeres: for the one is too weake and tender, and the other is too hard and ſtrong, to tame thoſe which ſhalbe taken wilde and fierce: for yee ſhall then ſoone hurt them. Therefore in houſing them firſt, yee ſhal make your doores large for them to goe in and out, and make a right comming in to the houſe, for cruſhing one another. And alſo let your ſtals be bourded vnder their feete, and likewiſe before them, and let the croſſe beame ouer their heads be of ſeuen foot high, to tye vp their heads if neede be. Yee ſhall alſo faſten them firſt therevnto, and within a while after, yee ſhall vſe to handle them by the head and hornes: and vſe to water them in the ſtall, for by comming abroade, they will ſeeke to breake away & wil not yeeld ſo ſoone to the keeper. Some doe yoke them together

                     
                        〈◊〉
                      two dayes abroad: ye ſhal likewiſe take good heede that one oxe touch not another with their hornes, ſo within two or three dayes that yee ſee them waxe more tame, towardes the Euening ye may proue to leade them foorth and to walke them halfe a myle ſpace or more, and ſo returne againe. But firſt yee muſt ſee to tye them ſo ſtreight, that they may not well moue their heades, then approthe gently, and goe before them, not behind them, nor on their ſides, and ſpeake to them fayre, and ſo accuſtome them to ſee and behold the keeper, then rubbe their heades, & touche their noſtrilles and mouzelles: ſo that they may knowe and feele the ſent of the keeper, and thus ye may vſe them all. Yee ſhall alſo waſh and ſprinckle them with wine to make them more tame and familiar with you, and then put your hand vnder their bellies, and betwixt their thighes: to the ende that when yee doe touche them there, they flye not away Flies. wormes and tykes, to take awaie. or ſtrike. And vſe them thus, that ye may at any time take from them flies, wormes, or tykes. Then vſe to bee more neere theyr ſides, but not behind for feare a blow with their feete. and then vſe to open their iawes and take foorth their tongue, and rubbe the pallet of his mouth with ſalt, and vſe once or twiſe a yeere to giue them a drinke, myxte with one pounde of ſalte greace melted, with three pintes of ale or wine, and by trayning and vſing them this, yee may ſoone make them tame, ſo that yee may ſoone after vſe them to the yoke, in coupling them with ſome other gentle oxe, and ſo vſe to tye them to ſome tree, or other thing, and then ye may vſe them to the plough. But firſt vſe them to ſome light earth, for the other may ſoone tyre, and ſo dull them, becauſe their neckes being yet but ſoft and tender, may ſoone be bruiſed and gaulded with the bow and yoake, if the earth be verie hard, and they as then are but tender & rude. And aboue all take heede in taming a Bull, that he Taming a bul. hurt you not with his hornes or feete. For if ye doe not vſe him orderlie at the firſt, yee ſhall hardely tame him after: but he wil haue one ill touch or other, and likewiſe an olde oxe, is more harder to tame and doubtfuller than the

young oxe. For I haue proued (ſayth he) and had experience thereof at my houſe. and to frame a young oxe to the plough or carte, yée ſhall matche him beſt with an olde oxe that is tame, very ſtrong and gentle, which To yoke a young oxe. will holde the young oxe backe if he be too haſtie, or plucke him forward, if he be too ſlowe, or if ye will ye may make a yoke for three oxen, and put the young oxe in the middes, and by that meanes ye ſhall make the moſt hardieſt oxe to be tame, and refuſe no labour at the length. For the young oxe (being neuer ſo ſtubborne) in remaining betweene the two olde oxen, they will if he be too flacke, conſtrayne him to drawe, or if he would ſhoote forwarde, they will holde him backe and ſtay him, or if he would draw backe, they will holde him forwarde. Alſo if he would lye downe, the other wil hold him vp. Thus by pollicie he may be let of his ſtubborne frowardnes. Alſo yoke him to wilde bullockes that haue not laboured before, and ſo let them gee yoked loſe together for two or three daies, and ſo they will waxe tame. And a little chaſtening after willmake him endure to labour wel, and ſome young oxen after they be made tame and gentle, they wil waxe weary and lie downe in the furrowe, and when any doe ſo, he ought not ſodainly to be corrected and raiſed againe by violence, but by ſome gentle VVeary oxen. meanes after a little reſt, for be maie lie downe by ſome other occaſion, as ſickneſſe or faintneſſe either want of meat and water, which wil trouble him more than blowes. Whē
                     anie lie ſo downe by ſlothfulneſſe, ye ſhall binde faſt his feet that he cannot riſe to feede, and let him ſo lie, and ſo he shal be conſtrained through hunger and thirſt to leaue his wearie ſlothfulneſſe, which doe ſeldome happe. Alſo yee ſhall not yoke together two beaſtes of vnequall ſtrength and ſtature,

Againe, thoſe beaſtes are beſt to labour that paſſe on the way without feare of ſhadowes, dogges, waters, or any other thing they ſée or heare, and thoſe beaſtes alſo that eate much, and ſlow in chewing: for they digeſt better, and doe keepe their force & vertue without waxing leane or feeble, more than thoſe

which are haſtie féeders. Alſo this is counted a great faulte in ſome kéepers of oxen, which will haue his oxe rather fat than leane: wherefore to labour, the body of a trauailing oxe or other ought to be in a meane or good ſtate, rather than fatte, hauing his muſkels or nerfes ſtrongly made, not charged with fatte: which will but gréeue them to labour when they are ſo. Thus I will leaue off their gouernment and ſpeake hereafter of diſeaſes, as if an oxe haue water in VVater in the bellie. his belly, ye ſhal giue him the iuice of hempe leaues, mixt with water to drinke, or the leaues of Elder ſtampt with ale or béere doe purge by ſeege, or the roote ſodde in olde wine or ale, and giuen, is good to voyde water out of the maw and bellie.

Alſo oft times cattell wil haue a ſickneſſe which will make them deſire to vomite, and caught with pouertie, the which ye ſhall helpe by Vomit to help. throwing into his throate faſting, a raw henne egge ſhell & all whole. Then on the morrow, take bruiſed Ramſons with the ſtalkes and mixe it with wine or ale, and giue it: or of common garlike put into his eares. This is not one thing alone to helpe them, but there is diuerſe others: as to mixe ſalt with their meate. And ſome do giue them of mugwoort with oyle or wine to drinke. Others doe giue them the rootes of léekes beaten with wine, or the ſéedes of firre trée, or frankincenſe trée, and alſo the ſéedes of ſauin, or rewe, to make them drinke it with wine or ale: and ſome doe giue them the herbe called in Engliſh, white Colleuer,

in Latine Droſtis, mixed with bitter fitches. So
                        〈…〉
                      do giue them a little of a ſerpents ſkinne beaten with wine. They doe vſe alſo to beate wilde time, or ſauorie in ſwéete wine, and ſo giues it, which is counted very good for them. Likewiſe the ſea Onion called Squilla in Latine, to be cut ſmal and ſoaked in water, and giuen to ſwallowe it. All theſe or euery of them when they are miniſtred, ought to be giuen and miniſtred thrée daies together, a pint or more at once to a beaſt, which wil purge their belly, and take away the diſeaſes, and alſo doth renewe them vnto ſtrength and health againe. And among all medicines the lees of oliues to be giuen, is a ſingular good medicine, mixt with aſmuch water as lees. Wherefore, it ſhal not be ill to accuſtome your cattle thus, yee ſhal firſt ſprinckle therewith gently their meate, and then put a little thereof into their water, and at length yée maie mixe in their water a more portion thereof: and ſo giue it vnto them, and likewiſe among their meate, ſo thus ye may vſe to keepe the continually in health as they did vſe them in time paſt.
               
               
                  The cauſes of peſtilence in Cattell.
                  THe cauſes of peſtilence, one thing is, the chafing of cattel: wherefore yée muſt not chafe your cattel muche in labour, ſpecially in the ſommer, for that doth beſides, bring vnto them the fluxe of the belly, or els an ague. Alſo ye ſhal neither let hogges, or hennes to enter into their ſtawles, for their doung being mixt with your cattelles meate, wil bréed a peſtilence at length, and kil them. And ſpecially the doūg of hogges doth bréede a murren among cattel (the ſooner) in eating thereof: if remedie be not ſoone had, they wil grow to a murren, and die thereof. The remedies are théſe, yée muſt by and by change their laier, and to deuide them into manie partes: and farre of from thence. And alſo to ſeparate the whole from the ſicke, for one beaſt infected will poiſon all the reſt in ſhort time. Nowe when ye haue changed them into other partes, ye muſt put them where no other

beaſtes do féede with them, to the end they doe not infect others therein, and to ouercome this peſtilent euill, is Medicine againſt the peſtilence. to giue them medicines therefore, thus yée muſt vſe them: Ye ſhall take of wilde carret called in Latine Daucus, or wilde Parſenepe, or of groundſtll, or of Angelica rootes, or the roote of the ſea holly named Eringion, in Latin, with fennell ſeede, and ſprinckle it with ſodde wine, and fine wheaten meale, with hot water, mixe them ſo together, and giue your ſicke cattell drinke thereof: then ſoone after yee ſhall make a drinke of Cacia, mirre, and Franckincenſe, in like portion, mixt with as much blood of the ſea Tortu, if ye can, then put all together in a quart of old wine, and then ſquirt it into their noſtrilles. Yee muſt miniſter this medicine thrée daies together, euerie daie a thirde part.
                  Wee haue (ſaith he,) found alſo a méete ſhort medicine and a good, which is, the roote called in Latine Conſiligo, in French Pomele, or Patedelion, in Engliſh I take it to be blacke Elleborie, which is verie good for al cattel Which roote ought to be taken after this manner.

Firſt, yee muſt bore thorow a circle of holes, with an awle or a bodkin of braſſe, or latin in the flappe or broadeſt part of the beaſts eare. But firſt chip awaie the haire on both ſides therof: and then bore your holes, ſo done, then when ye ſee the bloud iſſue forth like a rounde circle, ye ſhall then put into the ſaide holes of the foreſaide roote, cut in ſmall peeces. And when it is within the fleſh holes, that beaſt ſhall incontinently recouer and were freſh and luſtie againe, and ſhall not fall into the daunger of the ſaide venemous diſeaſe. For the roote will draw foorth al the venome at the ſaide holes in his eare. Whereby that part of the care will rotte and fall awaie, and by the loſſe thereof, the beaſt ſhall eſcape and be ſaued. Cornelius Celſus, his counſell is this, ye ſhall put into their noſtrelles, of Miſtleto leaues ſtamped

Some do lie him in the ſtal, & laies meate afore him, ſo that he cannot eate thereof, & then they take 4. pound of the toppes of lentiles, and the toppes of wilde oliues, and beates them together with a pound of hony, and put thereto 4. pintes of water, and then ſetteth it a night in the open ayre, and on the morrow giue it him, and within an houre after they giue him of wilde tares, or fetches ſoked in water, but no drinke: and this ye muſt do three daies together, till all the cauſe be taken away. Then if this doe not helpe his digeſtion or crowling of his guttes and belly, which thing doth trouble him ſo, that he cannot eate his meate, and it maketh him to weepe and to complain and mourne: then let him not reſt long in a place, and alſo if he lie on the earth, ye ſhal re

Alſo this is a manifeſt remedy for them: ye ſhal bind hard the vpper part of his taile next his bulcke, ſo done, ye ſhal giue him then a pint and a halfe of wine, mixt with a quarter of a pint of oile oliue, and make him to ſwallow it; and then leade him apace, the ſpace of a mile & a halfe. Then if the diſeaſe go not away; ye ſhall then annoint your handes with greace, butter, or oyle oliue, and

draw foorth his doung at his fundament, and make him like wiſe to runne a good ſpace after, if this profite not, yee ſhall take wilde figges dried, and all to bruiſe them, then mixe them with nine times ſo muche warme water, and ſo giue it vnto him. If this yet helpe not, yee ſhall then take two pounde of the leaues of myrtes, then ſtampe them and mixe them with thrée pintes of warme water, and ſo giue it with a horne, but firſt let him blood vnder the tayle, & chaſe him wel afore ye let him blood to bléede the better: and when he hath bledde ſufficiently, then ſtoppe it in binding it about with the barke of ſome tree, for cloſeneſſe. Alſo they vſe this remedy among the reſt, that is, to giue vnto the beaſt thrée ounces of beaten garlicke, in a pinte of wine or more, and then to driue and make him to runne a good while after. Another, they vſe alſo to beate two ounces of ſalt with ten onions, and then puts thereto a little melted honie, and ſo puts it into the tewel or arſegut of the beaſt: and after they chaſe him awhile and make him to runne. Al theſe aforeſaid haue beene aſſaied againſt lacke of digeſtion.

                  SUch ſuperfluous fleſh on the tongue of cattell wil hinder the beaſt oftentimes in eating his meate, being called of ſome huſbandes, the barbes, or teates, which doth grow long like teates nigh the roote of his tongue. Wherefore they doe caſt him, and take foorth his tongue and clippe them away with a payre of ſheares, or cut them with a ſharpe knife, and ſome doe burne them with a hotte yron: which way is counted more painfull to the beaſt. Then they rubbe it with ſalt and garlicke beaten together, till all

                  Alſo if a beaſt haue the barbes, which (as ſome do ſay) will grow and hang like flethe pimples vnder his tongue, which muſt bee clipt off, and then rubbed and chafed with garlicke and ſalt beaten together, as aforeſaide: and waſhe and rubbe his mouth gently with ſoft linnen dipped in warme wine, and bathe wel theſe ſores vnder his tongu

The remedy is, ye ſhall firſt chafe him a little, vp and downe, then caſt him and take forth his tongue, and pricke with an awle thorow the great & middle vayne therof vnder, and there at let him bléed well, and he ſhall amend ſoone againe: but looke then that the ſigne be not in the head, for then it is ill to ſtoppe. And ſomtimes a beaſtes tongue wil ſwel ſo bigge, that he can hardly take his breath, & ye ſhal ſee him lyll & holde out his tongue, then if there be not ſpeedy remedy he dieth: which remedie is, ye muſt pricke the vayne vnder his tongue as is afore mentioned and he ſhall do well

                  THe tongue of an oxe or bullocke ſometimes ſhall be ſwolne and venomed by eating of ſome venemous graſſe, or ſuch like, and then he wil commonly gape, & eate no meate, but ſtand holding downe his head and mourne. The remedy is, ye ſhal bruiſe a white onyon, and mixe it with a little good vinegre, then giue it him and make him to ſwallowe it downe: But firſt rubbe his mouth and tongue with all wel, and then giue it him. So done, ye ſhal paſhe a whole egge into his mouth ſhell and all, and make him ſo

to ſwallow it downe, and then he wil recouer and doe well againe.
                  Sometimes a beaſt wil be ſwolne all his bodie, by eating ſome euill thing and venemous among their graſſe, as the 
                        •
                     eld ſpider, frogges, ſnailes, eftes, or colde hearbes, as poppie, dwale, hemlocke, and ſuch which wil make them ſwel. The remedies are. Take of the iuice of plantaine, with the iuyce of wilde carrets by euen portion, and giue the beaſt therof, with a little vinegar. Alſo the iuyce of inugwort mixt with ale or béere, and giue it. Likewiſe, the iuyce of cleuers, or gooſe greaſe, ſtampt and ſtraind, and giuen, is a ſpecial remedy againſt venom of the field ſpider, and others alſo. Againe, the garden tanzy, ſtampt and ſtraind, and giuen with wine. Alſo the ſéed of the great Cowthiſtle dried and made into powder, and giuen with wine: or the roote therof boilde in wine and giuen. Likewiſe the leaues of anniſeſtedes boild in water and giuen. Againe, the ſéede of rocket beaten and giuen wiſh ale: or a handfull of betony leaues, ſtampt and ſtraind with ale and beere, and giuen. Likewiſe doth garlicke, beeing ſtamped together with Ale or Déere, and giuen with ale. Any of theſe are good alone to be giuen to a beaſt, when he is ſwolne, by eating of any venemous thing. And if ye do take of ſome hearbes 2. parts together, it wil then be the ſtronger and take more effect: but my counſel is, vſe them with diſcretion euen as yée ſhall ſee cauſe.

Which worme in Sommer wilbe créeping among the graſſe. If anie beaſt haue eaten ſuch, it wil poyſon hym, and he wil ſodainly ſwel thereof, ſo that within foure & twenty houres (if he be not remedied) he wil die therof. One remedy is, ye ſhal take a quantity of ſtale, &

Take a good handful of hearbe Robart, (which ſmels like a foxe:) Choppe it ſmall and bruſe it well, and then mixe it with good ale, or béere, and ſo giue it your beaſt. Another, Take of the earth of Ant hils, and mixe it with vineger, and ſo giue it to your beaſt. Thoſe are all good againſt the foreſaid venom of the tine worme.

                  THere is alſo another kind of ſwelling in oxen and kine, both through coſtinenes which is, when they are ſo hard bound in their bodies through heate, that they cannot dung, which will cauſe them to ſwell. The remedy is to chafe and driue him well vp and downe a good ſpace, if then he do not dung, ye muſt then annoint your hand with oyle or greaſe, then rake him and take forth his dung. Some do giue him of the

                  THere wil bréede in the tayle of cattel a certaine worme, like to a eating canker, which will bréede in the ende of his taile, which wil cauſe the beaſt to become leane and of il liking. Which place yee ſhal féele to be ſomewhat ſoft, and a little aboue that place on the inſide of his taile, ye ſhal ſlitte the ſkinne (with a ſharpe knife) two ynches long downeright: ſo done, then take a quantitie of

The ſignes are, when his eies waxe hollowe, and are dropping, his heade lumpiſhe and heauie, his mouth foaming and lathering, and drawing long his breath with payne, and ſometimes he will ſigh. So when yet ſhall ſee ſuche tokens, yée maie iudge it to be the feuer. The remedie: ye ſhall then kéepe him a daie and a night without meate or drinke. Then on the next morning faſting, yée ſhal draw a little blood vnder his tayle. Then about one houre after, yee ſhall giue him thirtie ſmall trunchions of Colewoortes, ſodde in ſalet oyle, and ſalt fiſhe water or bryne, and make him to ſwallowe it: thus yee muſt vſe him for fiue morninges together faſting, and yee ſhall caſt before him the tender braunches of lentile peaſe, or the tender croppes of the Oliue trées or ſuche, or elſe the tender buddes of the Uine: and yée muſt rubbe or cleanſe his lippes, and thriſe a daie yee muſt giue him colde water for to drinke, and ſo yee ſhal keepe him in the ſtal till hée bée whole and ſounde.
                  Alſo the feuer is gotten of labouring oxē, by great trauel in hoate times, and when he hath that, ye ſhal ſee him hang downe his head, his eyes wil inflame and bounce, and his bodie wil be hotte out of al order, which yee ſhall feele by touching his ſkinne. Wherefore they vſe to let him bloud on the vaine of his forehead, or on the vayne of his eare, and then they giue him of greene hearbs, as lettice, and ſuch other cold hearbes, and they bathe alſo his body with white, wine and ſo they giue him colde water to drinke, and ſo he wil amend.
               
               
                  Againſt the Cough in Cattell.
                  CAttel ſometimes wil haue the cough by taking of cold, or by greate trauell or by, eating ſome euil thing.

If the cough in an Oxe be newly taken, he may bee wel and ſoone remedied thereof, by a drinke made of water mixt with barley meale. Sometimes they vſe to giue vnto the beaſt, of ſtitchwoort ſmally chopt, with huſked beanes bruiſed altogether, and ſo giuen. They take alſo of lentile peaſe out of their huſkes, and then bruiſe them ſmal, and mixe them with thrée pyntes of warme water, and giue it with a horne. They heale alſo an old cough with two pound of Iſope ſtéeped in a quarte or more of water, with eyght pounde of lentyle peaſe, ſmally beaten and mixt altogether, and ſo giuen to the beaſt with a horne. Another: take the iuice thereof, with ſallet oyle, or the ſmal rootes thereof beaten with barley meale, and ſo giuen and make him to ſwallow it. Another: take the rootes of leekes cleane waſhed, and then beaten with pure wheate, and ſo giuen faſting. This doth heale any olde cough. Another: take of wilde tares out of their huſkes, then beate them with as much of huſked barley, and make him for to ſwallowe it. Another: Iſope alſo ſtamped with ale or beere, and giuen is good likewiſe, and to giue him no other drink for the ſpace of eight daies but mugwoort boyled in water and ſo giuen. Another: take fiue leaues of Aſarabacca, and ſtampe it, and then ſtrayne it with wine, or good ale, and ſo giue it with a horne to the beaſt. Another, mixe the powder of light woort, (which growes among ſtones, or on Okes like a dried turfe nigh the grounde) with ale or beere, and giue it warme, and it wil helpe. Alſo take butter, new ale, ſtampt garlicke, with dragon water, and ſo giue it the beaſt warm. Wel proued.
               
               
                  Impoſtumes in beaſtes to helpe.
                  IF any beaſt be troubled with an impoſtume or ſuche lyke ſore, the beſt ſhal bee to open the place with an yron, and when it is cut, then ſhal ye cruſh foorth al the yll humour and matter therein. Then ſtirre and waſhe it cleane with the warme vrine of an Oxe. So done, then vſe ſuch thinges

as doth cleanſe and heale. And take Cherpi, (ſo called in French) mixt with tarre and oyle oliue: & plaiſter wiſe cloſe the ſore therwith. If ye cānot within waſh the ſore clean, ye ſhal melt of the tallowe of an Oxe, or goate, and ſo powre it into the wound, & let it run down al about the bottome therof. Some ſores after they haue applied this medicine, they wil gather a fiery heate and a diſtilling of humor which wil diſcend vnto that place. Therfore to auoyde the ſame, ye ſhal waſh it with old vrine of men, and then to annoint it, with tarre and old greace mixt.
                  Againſt the impoſtumation of byles, they doe vſe to kill them by laying to of leuen, mixed with the ſea onyon Squilla, 
                     Byles. and ſome vinegar, and they alſo doe open the ſore and waſhe it with his owne piſſe made warme: then they tent it with lynt dipped in tarre, and in the ende, yee ſhall heale it with tentes dipped in moulten tallowe, either of Oxe or goate.
               
               
                  To heale the cloſhe or founder in the feete of Cattell.
                  THE cloſhe or foundering in the feete of cattell, is taken by ſome colde after a great heate, or by ſome vehement trauaile which haue ſtirred the blood ſo, that it goeth downe to the feet, like the founder of a horſe. When this do happen in cattel, it wil ſodaine viſite the hoofe of the beaſt, and yee ſhall feele it hoat, and payneth the beaſt ſo, that hee will not ſuffer you for to cruſhe the place. But when the bloud reſteth in the legges aboue the hoofe, yee ſhall but chafe him often, and rubbe him harde to make the bloud retyre agayne. If that profite not, yee muſt launce his feete gentlie rounde on the edge of his hoofes, with ſmal raſes not deepe. But if the bloud bee gone downe into the hoofe, yee muſt open then a little (with a ſharpe knife) in the middes vnder both the clawes. Then laye a tent thereto of lynt, mixt with ſalt, nettles and vinegar, and make him a buſkin of broome if yee can, for that is

more holeſome, and let not his feete come in anie water till hée bee whole, but keepe him drie in the ſtall.
                  And looke alſo that the bloud doe iſſue when ye doe cut him, for if then he doe not bleede, it will growe to ſome putrifaction, and ſo to impoſtumation, and then it wil bee long in healing. Therefore yee muſt open and cleanſe it wel, and bind thereto clothes ſt
                        •
                     eped in vinegar, ſalt, and oyle, and in the ende, take of olde greace and Deere ſuet melted together in like portion, and heale it therewith. If the bloud doe fal to the outmoſt partes of the clees, yee muſt then pare the endes thereof to the quicke, and ſo let them bleede. But ſee that yee open the clees in the middes of the endes, ſo that no impoſtumation be there, and they wil doe wel.
               
               
                  For ſinewes ſtiffe and ſhrinking.
                  IF an Oxe or other beaſt doe cloſh or hault thorow the ſtifneſſe of the ſinewes and nerfes, ye ſhal chafe his legges, knees, and hammes, with ſalt and oile mixt til they be wel. If the ſinewes be ſtiffe about the knees, ye muſt then bathe him with hoate vinegar, or with miſtleto ſodde in running water, or with millet (which is a graine like tares) and lyne ſeed, and in al iſſues, ye muſt ſcarifie and race the greened place, and then to put thereon of freſh butter waſhed in water and vinegar, and in the end annoynt it with ſalt butter mixed with Goates ſuet.
                  Alſo to boyle ſouthernwood in ſallet oyle, or neats feete oile, and ſo doe annoynt therewith. Another: the iuice of Stiffeneſſe of ſinewes. priuet mixt with oyle & therwith annoynt. Another: muſtard ſeed boyld in oile, & annoint the ſinewes therwith. Another: take of barlie meale, ſallet oile, rue, ſalt, & coriāder, ſtāp al theſe together, & ſo plaiſtred on: wil comfort both ſinewes, & nerfes. Another: take water ye cabbage or colewortts haue byn ſodde in, to bathe therwith is very good. Another: take lyneſeede, and barley meale, and mixe them wel together;

and then playſtred to, is good to molifie and make ſoft all hardnes of the ſinewes, nerfes, and iointes. Another: take the rootes of Saturian, ſtampe them and mixe them with ſhéepes milke, and then plaiſtred, wil ſupple the ſinewes pretily. Alſo horehound beaten with oyle and vinegar, and then plaiſtred to, doth the like ſupple the ſinews and nerfes. Some do ſay, take yarrow and barrow hogges greaſe, and beate them well together, and then laid too, will knit ſinewes together To knit ſinews being cut aſonder.
               
               
                  Againſt the ſwelling of the knees of cattell.
                  IF the knees of Oxe or Cow or other beaſt be ſwolne, yee ſhall firſt bath him in white vinegar. Then take vinegar, lineſeed, and millet, and ſprinckle it with honyed water, ſo mixe them and bind that to his knees: or els take a ſpunge kept in water that miſtleto is ſod in, and laye that vnto his knee. If there be any inflamation of humor, ye ſhall then lay too leuain, and barly meale ſtéept in warme wine, or in honied water boild, to ripe it, and when it is ripe, ye ſhall launce it with a razor, and then hele it with lint, ſalte, and oyle, as afore is ſayd. Cornelius Celſus ſaith, the rootes of flowerdeluce, or the ſée onyon ſquilla, with ſalte, or the iuce of knotgres put into the wound, will heale it. Alſo, all diſeaſes comenly in the body without wound being new, are healed by rubbings and chafings of the fleſh and ſkinne: but if they bée olde, ye muſt then cut or burne, and to heale them in melting butter or goates ſuet, and powred thereon.
               
               
                  To heale ſcabbes or galles in cattell.
                  IF your cattell be ſcabby, ye ſhal take of garlicke and bruſe it, and therewith rub and chafe all the ſores. Alſo againſt ſcabbe or gall: They take garlicke, ſauory, brimſtone powder, vinegar, and gall nuts beaten, with the iuyce of callamint,

neppe, or horehound mixt with ſoote of the chimney, and ſo annoint therewith. And if it grow to ſome vicer or great ſore, then to vſe and rubbe the place, with bruſed mallowes mixt with white wine, and bind thereof to the place. Alſo the great burre leaues beaten with oyle and layde too, all theſe afore mentioned are good.
                  And for the galling of the necke with the yoake, and if it ſwell but one ſide, ye ſhall let him bloud in the eare of that ſide: But if he be chaft in the midſt of the necke, then let him bloud in both his eares, and laye thereto a playſter made with the marrow of an oxe, mixt with the ſuet a buck, and then melte it all together with ſome oile and tarre: and therewith yee ſhall heale it: And it will do verye well.
                  Alſo if an oxe be gald and bruſed on his necke, a ſufficient medicine is this. Yee ſhall firſt drawe bloud at one of his eares. If not: Take of the hear be called in latin Auia, in french, Aus oiſeauls, beat it with ſalte, and ſo lay it too, aus if it do then aſwage the chyne of his necke, looke then on which ſide he hangeth or leaneth his head, and let him bloud on the contrarie ſide hee leaneth, on the eare. But before ye do this, ye ſhall beat his eare well with a twigge, and ye ſhall ſee it ſwell and ryſe on the vayne. Then launce the ſayde vayne and let him bléede well thereat: and on the next morning drawe ſome more bloud thereon, and ſo let him not trauaile of two dayes after. On the thirde daye yee maye trauaile hym a lyttle, and ſo by lyttle and lyttle yee maye vſe him to his taſke and former iourney.
                  But if hee be of neyther ſide galde, and yet his necke ſwolne in the middeſt thereof. Then yée muſt let him bloud on both his eares: and if ye let him not bloud within two dayes after the diſeaſe haue taken his necke, it will ſo inflame, that the nerfes and ſinewes will waxe ſtiffe, and then it will growe to a ſore of ingendred bloud: for which I haue found a ſingular good medicine, that is, yee ſhall take tarre, and the marow in an Oxe bone, with the

ſuet of a bucke, with olde oyle oliue, of ech a like portion. Then boyle al together and ſo vſe for to annoynt him when he leaueth his yoake. But firſt ye ſhall alwaies waſh him with the water where he commonly drinketh of, and then let it dyre, and then annoint him with the ſaid medicine. But if all his necke be ſo inflamed that hee cannot beare his yoake, the next remedye is to let him reſt, and vſe to waſh his necke with colde water, and ſo rubbe and chafe it with the fome of ſiluer or litarge. Celſus willeth to put on the reſt of his necke that is ſo inflamed, the afore ſaid hearbe called Auia.
                  
               
               
                  For a beaſt being hide bound.
                  THere is a diſeaſe in beaſtes called in Latin Coriago, in Engliſh, hide bound, which doth ſore torment and grieue a beaſt. This griefe happeneth to a labouring Oxe when he hath béene ſore traueiled in labour, or ſore traueling in traueiling in rayny weather, and thereby come to bee hide bound through pouertie. Wherefore ye muſt take héed whē they returne from labor being ſore chaft of body and ſhort of breath. Some do vſe therefore to ſprinckle them with wine, & do caſt a péece of the fat of a beaſt downe his throat: but if he haue this diſeaſe alreadie, it ſhall be good to ſéeth bay leaues in ale, and to bath him therewith as hote as hee can ſuffer. And ſodainely thereupon for to chafe and rubbe hym wyth oyle, and wyne mixt together, and to plucke and drawe his ſkinne on both his ſides, and looſe it from his ribbes: and it is good to be done in a hote ſunny daye, that it maye drye and ſinke therein. Another. Some do put too the lées of oliues, wyne, and greaſe, and annoynt therewith, which medycyne they doo vſe, after they haue done rubbing, and chafyng the beaſt. Alſo if a beaſt like not, and hys ſkynne doo cleaue to his bones, yee ſhall bathe hym all ouer wyth wyne, and oyle olyue, myxt together. Some do take mallowes boyld in wyne, or ale,

or worte mixt with oile, and ſo bath him therewith. Alſo, ſome do ſéeth whot graines in ale, and ſo bath and rub him therewith once a day for 3. or 4. daies together, and to giue him the water of boylde barly.
               
               
                  For the itch in cattell.
                  TThe itch oft times in cattell may come for lacke of good dreſſing. Alſo it may be taken of his fellows, and it may come by ill water and choler in the vaines. If a beaſt haue an itch, ye ſhal waſh and chafe him with his own vrin made warme, and mixt with olde ſalte butter: or ye ſhall annoynt him with oyle, roſin, and white wine melted together, Some do waſh it with piſſe, ſalte, and the iuyce of marigoldes, mixt all together. Uſe this and it wil helpe.
               
               
                  Againſt the lunges of cattel infected.
                  IF the lights or lunges of a beaſt be infected which is a greuous diſeaſe: For thereby he will waxe, leane and pine away, and at length he dries ſo in his bodie by a common cough, whereby at the length it will kill him, if he haue no remedie. The remedies are, ye ſhall pearce one of his eares with a little bodkin, (as is afore ſaid for the murren or peſtilence) and being ſo perſt, ye ſhall put into the ſaide holes, the burnt roote of ſome hazel tree. Then take a quantitie of the iuyce of léekes, with ſo much ſallet oyle, and mixe it with a pint and halfe of wine, and giue it him faſting, vſe this 9. mornings together, and he ſhal do well. Alſo if the ſicknes of the lightes be not ſore, they do giue him but the iuyce of léekes mixt with ſwéete wine, and they put of the burnt root of hazel into his eare, as afore ſaid.
                  But ye ſhall vnderſtand, if the beaſt haue continued long therewith, he wil then ſtand much, and eate but little, and therefore he wil waxe hollow and thinne of bodie: and ſome times he wil cough 20. times in one houre. Then he is ſore

taken and farre gone therewith, and very few do recouer, if he be not looked vnto. Wherefore the beſt way is, yee ſhall deuide your cattell aſunder, ſo many as he hath companied with, and then let them bloud a little, as aforeſaid. Alſo there be many men that can ſetter them, which is to cut the dewlappe before on the briſket: and therefore alſo there is graſſe, which ſome huſbands do call ſetter woort, or fetter graſſe, which ye ſhal take and bruſe it a little in a morter or diſh. Then make the dewlap hollow betwixt the ſkinne and the fleſh, and put thereof ſo much as a hens egge, into the ſaide dewlap, and then looke vnto it that it fall not forth againe, and he ſhall amend. This ſome haue prooued and it hath done well.
                  Alſo againe, ſome cattel wil haue their lunges growen to their ſides, which is gottē (as ſome huſbands ſay) by ſome great drought, or lacke of water in conuenient times. And when he is thus grieued therewith, ye ſhal heare him houſe, or haue (as it were) a hollow cough, and will forſake his meate, and his haire on his backe will ſtare vp right. Then the helpe is hard to recouer, but to kill him is beſt. Yet ſome do giue him of the lungwort, which lyes all the yere, (ſaue in the ſpring) in the grounde, and they giue a handfull of the ſaid rootes bruſed in ale or beere, foure or fiue mornings together, and no meate after of two houres ſpace. Others do take a quantitie of figges, with a handfull of I
                        •
                     ope, bruſed together, then boyle them a little in a quart of ale or béere, then ſtraines it and giues it cold to the beaſt 3. or 4. mornings, and let him not eate the ſpace of two houres after. Alſo to take a good handfull of penſis, or hearts eaſe, and ſtampe it with a quart of ale or beere, and then ſtraine it and giues it ſo to the beaſt 3. or 4. mornings, and then vſe him as afore is ſaid. All theſe are counted ſpeciall good againſt the ſaid griefe.
                  Alſo ſome huſbands ſay, this diſeaſe growes in a beaſt by ſurfetting and ſore chafyng and then ſodainely take colde thereon: to ſhew if he bee lungrowne, hee will then lather ſometimes at his mouth, in holding it commonlye

open, with a running water at his mouth and noſe. The cure therfore, they cut away a round péece of ſkinne in the gullet or briſket place, and then with their finger and a little ſalte make a hole downeward two inches or more, and then fils the ſaide hole with red garlicke ſtampt, and plaiſtred thereon with nettles ſtampt with ſalte, or with yarrow and ſalte mixt with vinegar. Then ſhall yee giue him this following. Take of fenecreke, or turmericke, of lungwoort hearbe, ſtampe all theſe together in a morter, and then mixe it with a pint or more of ſtrong ale, or beere, and ſo giue it. Uſe this twiſe or thriſe or more as yee ſhall ſee cauſe, and it will helpe, if he be not too farre gone. Often proued.
                  Likewiſe ſome do put into the foreſaide cut place, of lungwoort bruſed with ſalte a little, and thereof make it like a tent, and then wrappes it all ouer with freſh hogs greaſe, and bindes it round with a threed, and then role it in ſalte, and ſo put it downe the ſaide hole as farre as it will go, and ſo ſtich vp the ſayde hole agayne, and they giue him of lungwoort mixt in ale to drinke. And ſo he ſhall recouer God willing.
               
               
                  Againſt the byting of a mad Dogge.
                  IF a beaſt be bitten with any mad dog, ye ſhall take garlick and bruſe it, and then put it into a thinne linnen cloth, and then al to rub and chafe the bitten place therwith, and it wil do well. Some do ſquirt into the holes or waſh the wounde with water and ſalt long mixt before together, which is alſo a good remedy. Another: ye ſhall waſh and rub the bitten place, with the waybrode leaues ſtampt, and alſo to giue vnto the beaſt the iuyce thereof mixt with ale or beere. Another. Take the roote of the great bur and bruſe that with ſome ſalte, and ſo lay it to the bitten place, and this will help either man or beaſt. Well proued.
               
               
                  
                  Againſt the pallet of a beaſtes mouth inflamed.
                  THere will ſometimes both oxe and cow haue the pallet of their mouth inflamed ſo, that he cannot wel eate his meat, which beaſt oft times will giue a ſigh, in ſtanding and weighing more on the one ſide then on the other. The remedy is, ye muſt caſt him, and then race him in the pallet of his mouth, and make him there bléed well. Then yee ſhall giue him of red fetches without huſkes, mixt with gréene leaues, or ſome other gréene hearbes, but giue him no drye meate till he be through whole thereof.
               
               
                  To helpe the clowſe.
                  THe clowſe is a kind of griefe which do commonly happē on the necke of labouring cattel, which doth not ſo much moleſt them, as doth the inflamation, becauſe they doo not therby leaue their worke. For which thing it ſhalbe ſufficient to put and diſolue thereon of lampe oyle, and ſope mixt together, and ſo annoint. This is good. But the beſt ſhalbe, if ye can to let him reſt til he be whole: and ye muſt looke alſo that his necke then do not looſe his haire, which is ſoone loſt when they labour in the raine, or els ſweat: For when his necke begins once to pil (then feare the other,) yee ſhal then rub it with the powder of olde tiles finely made: and before ye do vnyoake, caſt of that powder on their neckes, and whē it is well dried on, then chafe thereon all ouer with the foreſaid oyle, and ſo ye ſhall alwayes kéepe your oxen in good order from time to time.
               
               
                  Remedies for the hoofe of a beaſt that is hurt.
                  IF the hoofe of your beaſt be hurt at any time either with culter or ſhare, or anye part of her clees hurt, yee ſhall

make a ſalue of pitch, olde greaſe, mixt with the powder of brimſtone, melted al together, and with a hote yron melt of that on the ſore hoofe or clét. This medicine is good alſo, whē the beaſt hath bene hurt either with ſtubbe or ſpell of wood, and if there be any little gone in, it will draw it forth, but if his foote be hurt farre within the fleſh, by ſome ſharpe ſtone or other thing, then ye muſt open the wound, and then ſeare it with ſome hote yron, and then bathe it three daies together morning and euening with warme vinegar, and wrap it with a buſkin of broome if ye can: Alſo if the beaſtes legge be hurt with the ſhare, then yee ſhall lay too of the hearbe called ſea lettis, or ſea ſpurge, mixt with ſalt, called in greek Tithimalus, for that is good to heale it, and is alſo good to heale the hurt in the foote, aſwell as on the legge: But firſte ye ſhall alwaies waſh it with hote piſſe of men, and then burne ready a fagot of ſome wood abroad, and aſſoone as the flame is out, make the beaſt tread on the hote embers with his ſore foote: Then annoyut it with tarre, and olde greaſe mixt together. It were good alſo to waſh your beaſt feete often with colde water when yo vnyoake them, for that ſhall keep them from foundering, and then after to annoint and chafe their paſturns, and betwixt their clées, with olde greaſe, and they ſhall do well.
                  Alſo if an oxe do halte of his foote through taking of ſome great cold, ye muſt then waſh it with warme vrin, but if it come through the cauſe of bloud or an impoſtume in the foot then ye ſhall chafe and rubbe it firſt well to ſtirre the bloud, and then raze the ſkin with a ſharpe razor, aboue the clées, and make it bléede, and waſh it with piſſe and ſalt, & if it wil not ſo heale but deſcend into the foot, ye muſt then open the toppe of the hoofe vnder, to the quicke: and make the bloud there to come forth, then lap his foot as afore is ſaid, or make a buſkin that no water or other thing get in to hurt it, till it be whole.
                  Likewiſe, if an Oxe be cut or grauelled in the foote, the helpe is, yee ſhall bathe him with warme vrine, and then annoint him with tarre, and olde greaſe, melted together,

and there is nothing better to vſe before ye doe vnyoke, then to rubbe and chafe their feete with old freſh greace.
                  If the feete of an Oxe do open and chappe, ſo that y• horne doe cracke and cleaue, ye ſhal bath it well firſt with warm Hoofe cho

                      vinegar and and ſalt, and oyle mixt altogether. Then lap it wel for a daie or more, and put thereon a plaiſter of olde greace, and pitch, melted together. And ſo it wil heele again and doe wel, and when his hoofes are broken, yee ſhal couer and wrappe them with linnen ſteeped in vinegar, oyle, and ſalt, for three daies ſtil renew it in laying to the ſayde medicine. Then on the fourth daie, melt pitch and olde greace together, and put it thereon with the barke of a pyne apple tree, cleane pulliſhed: and when it beginneth to heale, yee ſhal rubbe it al ouer with the ſoote of a chimney, and let it heale. But if yee make ſmal account thereof, there will woorms ingender ſoone in the ſore, and make it fal to a coldnes, if ye waſhe it not on morninges with colde water: ſo if this wil not heele it, ye ſhal then bruiſe of horehound, leeks, and ſalt together, and ſo laie it there too, and this will ſoone kil the wormes, and when the ſore is wel cleanſed, ye ſhal laye thereon a plaiſter of tow, mixt with pitch, oyle, and old greace, and ſo annoint it al ouer with the ſame, to keepe off the flie away and it wil do wel.
               
               
                  To helpe the bruiſe on the ſhoulder of a beaſt.
                  SOmetimes by long trauel a labouring Oxe in treading on the hard ground, or by ſome cruſhe againſt poſtes or gates, wilbe lame in their ſhoulders, and oftentimes ſore bruiſed: if this happen in anie beaſt, ye ſhal then let him blood on the fore legges. If he be hurt in the hinder hippes, ye ſhal then let him blood on the hinder legges, and then waſhe and bathe it with warme vinegar, ſalt and oyle mixt together, or bathe his ſhoulder with piſſe and mallowes boyled together. If theſe doe not helpe, then ye ſhal launce it a little, and then laye a playſter of pitch thereon and it

will heale it.
               
               
                  Againſt ſtinging with Adder or Snake.
                  WHen any beaſt is ſtung with Adder or bitten with a ſnake, it wil ſo ranckle; that the beaſt may ſoon die thereof, if there be not remedy ſoone had. Againſt any byting thereof ye ſhal bruiſe the roote of the great burre with ſalt, and ſo laye it too, and it wil take away the venome. Another better, which is, cake of the rootes of the ſharp pointed threeleaued graſſe, which beareth long ſweete leaues and rough, mixe the iuyce thereof with wine, and giue it ye beaſt, or caſt it into his mouth: and beate the leaues with ſalt and laye it to the ſore, if ye cannot haue the greene herbe bruiſe the ſeed with wine and giue it him, or bruſe ye ſtalks & roots, and then mixe it with meale, and ſalt, & honyed water, plaiſter wiſe laid thereon. Another: ye ſhal take v. pound of ye tender crops of an Aſh tree well beaten, and then mixt with three pynts of ſallet oyle, in ſo much wyne, thē ſtrayne it & giue it to the beaſt. Alſo take of the ſayd Aſhtree croppes, & beate them with ſalt, and lay it to the venoumed place. If a beaſt be ſtung, yee ſhal rubbe the place with the oyle of a ſcorpion, (which ye ſhall haue at the Apothecaries,) or giue him ſope mixt wt vinegar, & waſh the place with bur leaues, ſodde in water, or greene ſtampt with ſalt and layd too.
               
               
                  The ſtinging of the fieldſpider.
                  IF a beaſt bee ſtung wt the field ſpider, it wil ſoone cauſe nflammation, and grow to an impoſtume, if there be not ſpeedy remedy. A beaſt beyng ſtung with y• fielde ſpyder, or bitten with antes, al they be but ſmal wormes, yet their venom is great, & wil put the beaſt to great danger, & therfore ſome do hold, in pricking the place with a latten naule, and then mixe ſope & vinegar, & chafe the place therewith. Alſo ſome ſay, if the field ſpider be taken & put in oyle oliue, & ſo die therein & 
                        •
                     ot, if a beaſt bee ſtung of him, annoint with ye
                     
oyle and it wil helpe, and ſo like of other venemous worms put in oile,) but if yée haue none thereof, ſo that the wounde ſhew faire and without danger, yee ſhall but take of bruſed Cummin, mixed with tarre, and ſo annoint therewith: and plaiſter it thereon alſo: and it will take away the daunger thereof. But if it doe grow inward to an impoſtume, then it ſhalbe beſt to burne it with a hoat yron, ſo much as is corrupted, and then annoynt it with tarre, and oyle, and ſo it heales. Some lappes a liue ſpider in claye earth, and when it is drie, hanges it about the beaſts necke, and by that (they ſay) it preſerues the beaſt from being ſtung therewith. Againe, ſome doe ſtampe of wormewood, or Southernewood with Uinegar, and clappes it on the venomed place and it helpes. Alſo to take beaten cammamile, with hony, and lay it too, doth the like. Alſo take of houſe leeke, ſtampe it with ale, and giue it to drinke, or the water of a Lilly roote, bruiſed and ſtrained in water & vinegar, & ſo giuen to the beaſt.
               
               
                  Remedies againſt diſeaſes of the eies.
                  THe eie of a beaſt is tender & is a principal mēber, & ſoone may be hurt diuers wayes. The griefs therof are cōmonly healed with hony, but when they do inflame and ſwel, thē they mixe of the meale of pure wheat, with honied water & lay it too. Alſo if an oxe haue y• haw in the eye, ye ſhal heale it with the ſalt of the montain, or ſpaniſh ſalt, or Sal armeniacke, 
                     Haw in the eie. or ſal Capadoce, any of theſe beatē into a fine pouder, and blowne (with a quill thrée morninges) into his eye. Likewiſe the pouder of the roote called in Gréeke Silphion, (in Engliſh pelliter of Spayne,) mixe with ten times ſo much Salarmeniack, wel beatē together, & then blow thereof into his eie, & it deſtroyes the haw. Alſo the ſaid roote beaten with the oyle of maſticktrée, & ther with annoynt y• eye. Likewiſe for the haw or ſore eye, ſome makes a round collar of Sal armeniack, mixt with ſome hony, & layes it round about his eye, and annoynts theron al round about with tar reſolued with oyle oliue, for feare of bées comming to his eye, or to annoint his eye with the iuyce of Cammamell.

Alſo the leaues and ſtalks of Crow foote to be bruiſed & laid to the eie, doth take away the haw or webbe, and is good againſt a laſhe on the eie.
                  Againe, if a beaſt be ſtricken on the eye, yee ſhal take of the iuice of centory hearbe, and mixt with a little honie, and Stroke in the eie. therewith annoynt his eie, and laie it alſo plaiſter wiſe theron. Doe this againſt night, for feare of Bées troubling the beaſt: alſo if the eie of your beaſt chaunce to be ſtricken, ye ſhal take the croomes of wheaten bread, or other, and then ſoake it a little in roſe water, or vinegar, and ſo lay it to his eie, and it will helpe. But if it ſwell or inflame, then the beſt is to take ſouthernwood, and bruiſe it with a litle vinegar Eies inflamed. and laie it too. Alſo the iuice of Pimpernell, is good againſt all griefes of the eyes, or to be mixed with other thinges.
                  Alſo againſt the watering of beaſtes eies, as ſometimes Watry eyes. they wil runne of water. The remedie therefore, they vſe to laie on the browes or eye liddes, the meale of dried barley, tempered with water, and honey. Alſo the féeds of wild parſenepes, or the iuyce of wilde dayfies mixed with honie and ſo annoynt: which is alſo good againſt anie paine of the eies, then annoint it all ouer with tarre and oyle mixt as aforeſayd for feare of bées comming to the hony, and troubling the beaſt. And alſo for the webbe in the eye, yée ſhall take of white ſalt, and wrappe it in a linnen cloth, and then rake it vnder the embars, and burne it, and then take & beat it to a ſmal pouder, and with a gooſe quil blowe thereof into Webbe in the eye. his eie, and then holde your hand thereon a while, & ye ſhal ſée it water, and therevpon amend. Alſo the iuyce of Dragōs to annoynt the eie is good againſt the web in the eie, and the iuyce of the wild lettice doth the like. Alſo, for a ſore eie in a beaſt, yée ſhall ſpurt beere therein, or chewe the leaues of ground Iuie, and droppe it in his eye, or the iuyce thereof in like manner, mixt with a litle powder of Gynger.
               
               
                  
                  If a beaſt chaunce to ſwallow a horſeleech worme in his water.
                  IF anie beaſt, doe ſwallow downe a horſléech with his drinke, which wil moleſt and trouble him greatly. For ye ſaid horſeléech wil cōmonly ſtay in his throat and there ſuck blood, and ſo wil inflame the place in cauſing his throatebowle to ſwell, whereby he wil ſore trouble the beaſt in letting the paſſage of his meate, ſo that hee cannot ſwallowe, nor take his winde. If ſhée lie ſo farre within, that one cā
                     not take her foorth with his hande, ye muſt then put a quill or ſome kane into the beaſtes throate, filled with hoate oile and let it goe downe, or ſquirt oyle and ſo ſoone as the oyle doe but touch the worme, ſhe wil fal off. Yée may alſo get her off by letting the fume of the punaiſe vnto her, (which is in Italy, a ſtinking worme like a tycke,) which aſſoone as ſhe féeleth the fume, ſhe wil fall off, But if ſhe doe holde and ſtaie in the ſtomake & entrales, then yée muſt giue the beaſt hoate vinegar which wil kil her: and this wil ſerue as wel for other cattell.
               
               
                  For the Dewbolne in cattell.
                  THe dewbolne in Oxe, Cow, or other beaſt, is ſwelling in his body as much as the ſkinne may holde, which ſwelling is verie dangerous to ſome for burſting, it is gotten by eating of the trifoly graſſe in a dewy morning (as ſome ſay) which graſſe maketh him ſo to ſwell as though he woulde burſt. The remedy is, ſome doe chaſe and driue him ſoftly vp and downe to make him to doung. If that doe not helpe, then ye muſt rake him and take foorth his doung. If that wil not ſerue, then they ſtrike a hole with a knife or bodkin into the hollow part of his backe aboue his flanke, and ſo thereat lets out the winde by a fether or quil, and ſo he will recouer againe. But beware ye ſtrike him not ſo déepe that yée pearce his guts. Alſo to giue him rue, or garden tanzey ſtampt with wine and ale to drinke is very good for ye ſame,

or giue him a quart of veriuyce.
                  This diſeaſe commeth to a beaſt that is gréedy and is put into a Paſtor of ſuch rank graſſe in eating ſo gréedily thereof that his ſides will ſwell as high as his backe bone, and ſometimes the one ſide will ſwell more than the other, and yet few die thereof, and when a beaſt is ſo, he may not bee haſtily driuen nor laboured til he bee ſwaged, for it is but a ſubſtance of winde within his body. Therfore it is good to driue him ſoftly and ſuffer him not to lye, ſome doe ſtrike him as aforeſayde ſo deepe till the winde doe come forth, for wynde do remaine betwixt the body and the great panche, and his bowels.
                  Wherfore it is euill to put a hungry beaſt into ſuche paſture after a deawe or rayne, for the ſayde graſſe is then ſo ſwéete and windy withall, that it filleth them full of winde, and when they be ſo ſwolne, ſome beaſt wil ſtand ſtil, ſome will lie downe, but if ye can raiſe him, ſtirre hym vp and downe to make him doung. For if he doe once doung, he is paſt danger for that time, but if he lie and wil not ryſe, yee ſhall ſtrike him in with a ſharpe knyfe or bodkin, three ynch deepe or more, if that wil not ſerue, thruſt hym ſo deepe till ye ſée the winde come foorth. Then ſome doe put a quill into the hole, or a fether, that the winde may come foorth thereat the better, and when yee ſhall ſee him well ſlaked, yee may then laye a little tarre thereon to keepe off the flye, and hee ſhall doe well agayne in a ſhorte ſpace.
               
               
                  Againſt the ſtinging of hornet, waſpe, or breeſe flie.
                  IF your oxe or Cow bee ſtung with waſpe or hornet, ye remedy is, ye ſhal temper Ceruſe or redde leade in water, & then rubbe the ſtung place therewith, it is good alſo to ſprinckle the place where the beaſt do feede, with the decoction of bay leaues ſod in water. Alſo how to make that the breeſe flie ſhal not annoy and bite cattel when they labour,

which is, yee ſhall rubbe the beaſt with the decoction afore mentioned. Alſo if any be ſtung or bit therwith, ye ſhal rub and wet that place al ouer with the froth or ſpittle of ye ſayd beaſt, and that will helpe. Likewiſe take the iuyce of mallows and rubbe or annoynt the place therwith, and it will helpe, or to annoynt the beaſt with ſallet oyle, which will make that the flye wil not touch the beaſt, where he is ſo annoynted.
               
               
                  How to kill lyce or tykes on cattell.
                  IF your oxen or kine, or other cattel be lowſie, which commeth ſometime by ſome ſicknes or ſurfet in taking cold after a great wet or raine. Sometimes by great pouerty, wherby ſo long as they are vexed with lice, ſo long they wil not proſper. The remedies are, ye ſhal take the decoction of wilde oliues mixt with ſalt, then rubbe and chafe the beaſt all ouer therewith. Another: take of quickſiluer killed in oyle oliue and mixt wel together, and therwith annoynt. Another: take the roots of white ellebory, otherwiſe called neeſing pouder, and mixe of that pouder with oyle, & therewith annoint, or boile it with good vinegar, & ſo waſh therewith. Another: take of bearefoote herbe, ſtampe it and then ſtrayn it with vinegar, then mixe therewith the powder of brimſtone, and waſh the beaſt therwith. Another: take garlicke and ſtampe it, and mixe it with peniriall, and then giue it to the beaſt with ale or beere, and let him be chafed a while after. Another: take the ſéede of ſtaueſacre, dried and beaten into a fine pouder, then mixe it with oyle or freſh greace, and annoynt ye beaſt therwith. Al theſe afore mentioned are good to kil both lice and tickes, for ſo long as your cattel are troubled therwith, they wil proſper ſmally although ye féede thē wel, yet a good paſtor may do much herevnto, but it will be long ere they recouer. And ſome doe ſift aſhes on their backs and then rayne killeth them.
               
               
                  
                  Againſt anie ſwelling in Oxe or Cow by eating of ſome venemous herbes.
                  A Beaſt by chance ſomtime wil haue a ſwelling in al his bodye, which may come by eating of ſome venemous herbe or ſuch like, as of the groūd thiſtle called in Latin Camaelion, or of hēbane, hemlock, or toadſtools. If he haue eaten anie of theſe, they wil make him ſo to ſwel that he will leaue his meate. The remedie is, ye ſhal chop very ſmall, a good handfull of wormewood, and then ſtirre it with a good quart of ale or béere, and ſo giue it vnto the beaſt, if once giuen doe ſmall profite, giue it him againe twiſe or thriſe, & ſome do ſtirre him thē vp & down a good while after. Others do keep him in the houſe an houre or two after, & ſo he hath done wel againe. Alſo yough is euil for cattel to eate.
               
               
                  Againſt ſwelling of Cattell by eating of greene corne.
                  IF your cattel doe chance thorow negligēt kepers to break into your corne and eate thereof when it is nigh ripe (as in the time of harueſt,) of barley, ry, or wheat, it wil make thē mightily to ſwell by lying and ſprouting in their mawes, which thing wil put them in dāger of death, if they haue not ſoone remedy. The helpe is, ſome do vſe to driue them vp & downe till they ſee them aſſwage thereof, and ſo they recouer, and ſome do throw a new laid egge ſhel and al into the beaſtes mouth, and breakes it in his mouth, & makes him to ſwallow it with ale. Agayne, ſome other do take a handfull of the tops of nettles, beatē wel & then ſtrayned with wine, or honyed water, and ſo giuen. Alſo to take of Anniſeſeeds bruiſed & giuē in wine or ſtrong ale, or to take a handful of ye leaues of Aron or cuckoeſpit, mixt with ſalt & vinegar & giuen. In likewiſe take of iuniper leaues or greene berries, ſtampe & ſtraine them with wine, & then giue it the beaſt. All theſe aforeſaid haue bin prooued good remedies againſt ſuch ſwellings, or take ſoote, & the hard row of a red hearing,

beate them and giue the beaſt in ale or beere.
               
               
                  To helpe the garget in the throat of a beaſt.
                  IF the garget be in the throat of a beaſt, it will trouble him ſore, which is commonly taken by ſome great drought for want of water, and it will cauſe a ſwelling vnder the ioules or the ſides therof. The remedy is, ye ſhall caſt him, then cut and flée the ſkinne on both ſides, ſo far as any ſwelling doth appeare. So done, then take of the whiteſt ſifted aſhes that ye can, and mixe them with the groundes of ſtale olde piſſe, and ſtur them well both together, then alſo waſh the fleſhy ſore therewith. Some do boyle it firſt, and then waſh therewith, both the waies are good. Then ye ſhall cloſe vp the ſkinne againe, and annoint it with tarre and oyle mixt. Alſo ye may laye thereon a plaiſter of nettles bruſed and myxt with ſalte, and ſo it wil heale it. Or a plaiſter of pitch likewiſe.
               
               
                  To helpe the garget on the tongue.
                  THe garget in the tongue of the beaſt, oxe or cow, is a certaine ſwelling vnder the root of his tongue, which will cauſe his head and face to ſwell, & to froth alſo at the mouth, he will then forſake his meat in often gulping in his throat. The remedy is, ye muſt caſt him on ſome ſtraw for bruſing, and then take forth his tongue, and with the point of a ſharp knife, ſlit along the middle vaine vnder an inch, right from the root of his tongue, and there wil come forth blacke bloud and water, which cometh from the gall: Then ye ſhall rubbe the place with ſalt and vinegar mixt, and ſo he will recouer and do well againe. Often proued.
               
               
                  
                  To helpe the blayne of the Tongue.
                  THe blaine of the tongue which will come to ſome cattell, is a certaine bladder growing aboue on the roote of his tongue, againſt the pipe, which griefe at length in ſwelling will ſtoppe his wind, which cometh at the firſt by ſome great chaſing and heat of the ſtomach: wherby (as ſome do iudge) it doth ſtill grow and increaſe by more heat. For commonly it cometh in ſommer and not in winter: For when the beaſt is hot and hath bene chaſt, then (if there be any) it will riſe, and ſwel full of winde and water, ſo when it is full, and bigge withall, it will ſtoppe the beaſtes wind, which ye ſhal perceiue by his gaping and holding forth his tongue, and foming at his mouth. If then there be not ſpeedy remedy, he will ſodainly fall and dye. The remedy is, to caſt him and take forth his tongue, and ſlit the bladder or break
                        •
                      it thereon: then ſoftly waſh it with vinegar, and a little ſalte. So he ſhal do wel againe.
                  This blaine on the root of the tongue, cometh by great chaſing, and faſt driuing, and for want of water, they take a heat and ſo riſeth the blaine: which cattell wil ſodainly dye thereof, ſpecially fat cattell, for they will ſooneſt haue the blaine. Some beaſt wil haue many vnder the tongue. Therfore ye muſt pricke them with an awle, if ye haue no other toole, and then chafe them ſo with your hand that ye breake them all, for the breaking doth helpe as aforeſaid. Then piſſe thereon if ye haue no other thing, and ſo he ſhall do well. Often proued.
               
               
                  Againſt the garget coming by any puſh or other ſtroke.
                  VVHereas the garget bréedeth in cattell vpon ſome bruſe or ſome puſh, ye ſhal cut a hole where the bruſe is, & make it hollow to the bottome thereof. Some do

but cut and raiſe the ſkinne ſo farre as the bruſe goeth, and then make and haue ready of beaten garlicke, and the toppes of the ſharpe nettles, with ſome reſty bacon of the outſide, beat all well together, then put it into the ſaid hole: then ſhal ye bath it twiſe a day as followeth. Take the groundes of ale or beere, and the ſoote of a chimney, of white ſifted aſhes, of blacke ſope if ye can, mixe all theſe well together, and ſtur it well ouer the fire, and make it warme: Then hath and waſh the ſore place therewith, vſe this morning and euening till it be through whole. Well proued. Another way. Some do cut a hole on the vpper ſide of the bruſe or ſore, and then make it hollow: Then they take of gooſe greaſe, and blacke ſope, with a little tarre, and then boyles them altogether in a panne, and poures it boyling hot into the hole. Uſe this once a daye, and this will heale it. Often proued.
               
               
                  Againſt the garget in the maw.
                  THe garget in the maw of cattell is an euil thing, which is gotten when they couet to eate of crabbes or acornes lying vnder the trees: Which thing ſometimes they will ſwallow ſome whole without breaking or chewing, which fruit lyeth whole in their maw, and wil not digeſt. But in continuance of time they will ſprout and grow in their mawes (as ſome ſay) which thing will cauſe the beaſt to ſwell, and ſéeme as though ſome thing did ſticke and trouble his gullet and throat. And thoſe beaſts that haue eaten many thereof, and lyeth in their mawes vndigeſted, are like to dy therof, if remedy be not ſoone found: the remedy is, ye ſhal take a good quantity of whole muſtard ſéed, & thē mixe it with wine, or ſtrong ale and giue it to the beaſt. Another. Chop, & then bruſe ſmall a good handfull of camamile, & then mixe it with wine, and giue it the beaſt. Another. Take a handful of ginniper crops or beries, cut them, and then al to bruſe them ſmall: Then mixe it with wine, and giue it.
                  
                     
Another. Take peniryall, rocket, garden mint, of each in like quantitie, ſtamp them together, then put a pint of wine or ale, and let it ſtand cloſe couered all night: on the morrow ſtraine it and then giue it the beaſt. Another. Take a good handfull of the the rootes and leaues of Auens, waſh them, & then lay them to ſoke all a night in wine, or ſtrong ale, then on the morrow ſtampe them, and then ſtraine them, and ſo giue it the beaſt. All theſe remedies are found good to diſgeſt, and alſo for the clenſing of the maw.
               
               
                  To helpe an oxe or other beaſt that haue loſt their Quide.
                  IF an oxe or other beaſt by chaunce do léeſe his quide, as ſometimes a beaſt by ſome occaſion his quide will fal from him out of his mouth, and then he will mourne and haue no ſtomach to eate, becauſe the meat which he hath alreadie eaten will not diſgeſt. The remedy is: ſome do vſe to take part of the quide out of another beaſts mouth, which is of like nature, as if it be a cow that do want her quide, to take ſome of the quide of another cow, and giue it her to ſwallow down, and by that meanes ſhe wil do wel againe: and ſo the like of other beaſtes. Alſo againe ſome do take a handfull of the hearbe cald Cudwoort, which they bruſe ſmall, and puts a quantitie of fat thereunto, and ſo conueigh it into the beaſtes mouth to ſwallow that haue loſt his quide, and ſo he will amend. Againe, ſome other take a péece of leuen, and put that into the beaſtes mouth, as afore ſaid, and ſo he will thereby recouer againe. Alſo when a beaſt hath loſt his quide cleane, ye may giue him lome of a wall mixt with piſſe, and make him ſwallow it. Or ye ſhal take the crum of bread, and mixe it with a little ſalt, and there withal, to rubbe and chafe the tongue of the beaſt: but if he haue ſo remained long, whereby he is farre ſpent and waſted, then yee ſhall take forth his tongue and pricke the vaine there vnder with an awle in 2. or 3. places, and ſo it will bléede, and thereby he will recouer againe and do wel. Often proued.
               
               
                  
                  To helpe calues that haue the wormes.
                  CAlues wil oftimes haue wormes in their bellies, which wil annoy them much, & at length kil them: and when they are ſo troubled therwith, ye ſhal ſée ſome rū vp & down, not to ſtand or abide long in a place, & ſome will lye downe, ſhake, & quiuer, & ſtraight way vp again & about, & ſome wil hold their heads oft toward their ſides: and thoſe wormes in calues do bréed of an il digeſtiug of their meat. Wherfore yée muſt then ſée often vnto them, that they come not into the foreſaid danger: but when any calues haue thē, to helpe him thereof, ye ſhal take lupin peaſe halfe raw, and bruſe them, & then make them into ſmall péeces, and caſt of thoſe into his throat, and make him to ſwallow them: ſo many as ye ſhall ſéeme good. Do this a mornings and it wil kill thē. Another. Take ſothernwood, or wormewood, & bruſe thereof with dry figs, & with fetches, & make the like paſte thereof, & caſt them into his throat. Another. Take one part of olde greaſe, with 3. parts of Iſope, then mixe and beate them al wel together, and then giue it as the other aforeſaid. Another. Take of the iuyce of horehound, beaten and ſtampt with a quantitie of léekblades, and ſo made in pellets and giuen. Another. Take of wormeſéed, & bruſe it wel, and giue it in wine. and ſo giue the powder of ſauin mixt with wine or ale: if thoſe wormes be in the maw of calues, then ye ſhall giue them a little of the oyle of Sauin, mixt with a little newe milke, and that will kill them being in the mawe of anye beaſt. Alſo weaning of calues ſometimes will bréed wormes, when they come to graſſe ſoone after they be weaned. Which thing yee ſhall perceiue when they are troubled therwith, for they wil then tremble and ſhake, & ſometimes ly and ſprawle on the ground. The remedy is, ye ſhall then take a quantity of the ſoot of a chimnn, with the like quantity of ſower leuen, and a little tarre, then ſtur & mixe all theſe together well, in a pint of newe milke from the come, and ſo giue to each calfe a

portion thereof. Uſe this for foure mornings together. A pint of milke will ſerue foure calues at a time. Alſo ſome do giue them of tanners owſe to drinke, and ſo thereby they recouer and do well.
               
               
                  Wormes in cattell.
                  IF your cattell be troubled with wormes, ye ſhal ſtampe a good handfull of wormewoode, then ſtraine it with ale or béere, and giue it to the beaſt with a horne. Another. Take a handful of boxe leaues, cut them, and ſtamp them, and giue them with ale or wine, or take the powder thereof and mixe it with new milke and ſo giue it. Another. Take of the hearb calde prickmadam, which groweth on houſes or walles) a handfull: then beat the leaues and tops therof, and ſo mixe it with all or beere, & ſo giue it with a horne. Another. Stamp a good handfull of mugwoort, then ſtraine it with ale, & giue it. Or take a handful of the red nettle, which carrieth the red flower, cald archangell, ſtampe and ſtraine thereof into als or beere and then giue it. Another. Take a handful of wood ſage, or wild ſage, bruſe it, then ſtraine it with ale, & ſo giue it. Another. Take and ſtampe of garden creſſe, & then ſtraine it with ale & ſo giue. Another. Take and ſtampe garlicke, & mixe it with milke or ale and ſo giue it. Al theſe are ſpeciall good againſt wormes in cattell.
               
               
                  Againſt paine in the feete of cattell, called of ſome husbands, the foule,
                  SOmetimes cattel will haue a diſeaſe betwixt their cleaſes, cald y• fowle: Which griefe ſometimes wilbe in y• fore féet, & ſometimes on y• hinder féet. Which grief wil cōmō
                     ly ſwel & make y• beaſt to halt. The remedy is; yee muſt caſt him, and then bind his foure feete together. Then take a rope of haire, or ſome other hard twiſted rope, and draw it vp and downe betwixt his cleaſe, till yee make it bléede well. Then take ſome tarre and mixe it with ſome

hony, and freſh greaſe, and lay to thereof. Then put a buſkin, or ſuch like thing on his foot, to keepe it from dirt, and then ye may put him into ſome cleane paſture till hee bee whole: or to keepe in the houſe and he wil ſoone be whole, in two or three daies againe.
                  There wil breede alſo (as ſome huſbands ſay) a like griefe and ſwelling betwixt the clees of cattell, called the worme, which wil grow to a bunch and ſo to a ripenes, and at length it will breake, and it will be in the middeſt of his clees, and and ſo it will make him halt, ſo much that hee cannot well go. When that ye ſhall ſee it ſwell ſo bigge, ye ſhall then launce it, and ſo let forth the corrupt matter. Then annoint it with tarre, and freſh greaſe mixt, and then kéepe his foote cleane for two or three daies, and it ſhall do well againe.
               
               
                  To helpe a beaſt that piſſeth bloud.
                  Some doo take a loch fiſh quicke and put it down the beaſts throate. If that helpe not, yee ſhall take of bloudwoort hearbe, of ſhepheards purſe, of knotgraſſe, of each a like quantity, ſtampe them altogether: then ſtraine them with a quart of the milke of one coloured cow, and put thereto alſo a little runnet, made of the ſaid milke, and mixe therwith the leuen of browne bread, then ſtraine them all together, and ſo giue it with a horne. Uſe this morning and euening eight or nine daies, and it will helpe. Or giue him of the powder of the rinds of pomgarnets, or the powder of the huſkes of acornes, with red wine, and it will alſo helpe him. Likewiſe the ſhell ſtones (that lye in erable lands, as a fore ſaid) firſt burnt, and then beat into fine powder, and put into the runnet of milke and ſo ſturde well together, and ſo giuē the beaſt. Uſe this 3. or 4. daies morning and euening and be ſhall do well.
               
               
                  
                  To helpe the ſhewt of bloud in cattell.
                  THe ſhewt of bloud commonly is, to thoſe beaſtes which haue bene euil kept, & then to be put to feede in good paſture, thoſe wil ſo féed that they wil ſoone waxe fat, and ſo increaſe of bloude, that they will caſt their bloud at their mouths. The remedy is, when ye ſhal ſée any ſo, ye ſhal cut of the toppes of both his eares, and then with a ſmall ſticke ye ſhall all to beate them, and that will cauſe them bleed the more, and thereupon he will amend. Some lets bloude on the necke, which is very good if hee can finde well the vayne. And ſome let bloude on the vayne vnder the eye. All theſe are very good againſt the ſayde ſhewt of bloud. Alſo ſome do take of the hearb turmentil, ſtampt and ſtraind with ale or beere, and ſo giuen, which haue bene proued alſo very good againſt the ſame.
               
               
                  The warnell wormes in cattell.
                  SOme cattell will haue certaine wormes ſticking within their ſkinne on their backes, cald (of ſome huſbandmen) warnell wormes: which wormes cometh commonly vnto beaſts which are poore and leane by great pouerty, which wormes wil ſticke as on their backes along on both ſides thereof, a foot déepe or more, which are euil for the ſale of the ſkin if it be then taken. Alſo ye ſhall perceiue them within y• ſkin of the beaſt, like ſmall knots or knobs, & they wil ſhew and appeare ouer the ſkin like black ſpots. The remedy is: ſome do picke them forth with the point of an awle, yet ſome huſbāds do ſay: as the beaſt doth grow in fatnes, thoſe warnell wormes will weare away, and his ſkin will be againe as ſound as any others.
                  Alſo ſome cattell will haue a diſeaſe run in diuers partes of their bodies and legges, called (of ſome huſbands) y• waribréede.

The remedie is this, yee muſt caſt him and binde his foure féete together, & with a hoate yron (if the waribrede be long,) ſeare them off hard by the body, but if it be but beginning, and is yet but flat and low, then yee ſhal but laye the hoate yron thereon: and ſeare it but to the ſkinne, then annoynt it with tarre and freſhe greace mixed, and ſo it wil heale for euer.
               
               
                  Againſt the goute in Cattell.
                  CErtayne cattel wil haue (as ſome huſbandes ſaie) a griefe in their féete ſometimes, which they cal the gout, and commonly it wilbe on their hynder féete, which thing will cauſe the beaſt to goe very ſtiffe behinde. For which griefe I could neuer finde any perſon that could helpe it, but the beſt is, for to bathe his feete in colde water, and then to put him into good paſture and make him fat and ſo ſel him.
               
               
                  Againſt looſeneſſe of teeth in Cattell.
                  YE ſhal vnderſtand when the teeth of any beaſt is looſe, ſo long he cannot well eate his meate, which ſomtimes commeth thorow the feeble and weakneſſe of the beaſt, and ſomtime by a colde reume, gotten by lying in ſome cold and wet place, or by eating of much watery graſſe. The remedy is, ye ſhal caſt him, and draw blood on his gummes: and ſo he wil amend, ſome do rubbe and annoint his gums: (after his blood letting,) with ſtrong ſacke, and ſo he wil amend. Alſo ſome doe ſlitte his tayle vnder, nigh his rumpe, and byndes thereto a little bruiſed garlicke, and ſo he will recouer and doe well againe.
               
               
                  Againſt mylting of a beaſt.
                  THe mylting of Oxe, Cow, or other beaſt is called of huſbandmen, when he wil ſodeyne lye downe if ye ſhal ſtay neuer ſo litle, beyng at plough or cart. Which griefe is gotten by ſome blowe or ſore ſtrype (with gode or ſuche

like) on the beaſtes ſide: which makes him to faint and fall down. Whē any ſhal ſo lie down ye ſhal not raiſe him vp ſodayne agayne, but ye ſhal then turne him, and lay him on the other ſide, and ſo let him reſt a while, and ſo he wil recouer agayne: then if ye can, bruiſe of the barke of an Aſhe, and ſtrayne it with ale, and ſo giue him to drinke, and hee ſhal doe well.
               
               
                  To helpe any beaſt that cannot piſſe.
                  THey vſe to giue vnto an Oxe that cannot piſſe, of warm water mixt wt brā, which is good to make him piſſe: alſo take and ſtampe of ſowthiſtle, and then heat it with ale or beere, and ſo giue it to y• beaſt. Another: take and bruiſe a hādful of anniſeedes, and then mixe it with ale or beere and giue it. Another: take & bruiſe of Carduus benedictus, thē ſtrain it with white wine, and ſo giue it to the beaſt. Anye one of theſe aforeſaide, is good to be giuen a beaſt, when hee cannot piſſe, and to prouoke hym there vnto.
               
               
                  Againſt the flowing of the gall in cattel.
                  THe flowing of the gall in Oxe or other beaſt, the chiefe occaſion thereof, ſome huſbands cannot wel tel, except it ſhould be the aboundance of choler, encreaſing by great trauel in hoat times, and ſo there by filling the gall wt choler, & therupō it flowes al ouer the body, & ſo encreaſeth y• yelows or iaundiſe. The remedies are, ſome takes of gal woort herb, which is bitter, & then ſtamps a handful thereof, & ſo ſtrains it with a quart of ale, & ſo giues it to the beaſt 2. or 3. mornings. Another: ye may alſo giue the iuice of wormwood or ſouthernwood ſtampt and ſtraind with ale, and ſo giuen as y• other. Another: take y• inner green barke of elder a handful, and ſoke it al one night in beere or ale in a veſſel, cloſe couered: then ſtraine it in y• morning, and ſo giue it to the beaſt. Another: ſome do giue the iuyce of mugwoort mixed with honied water, with a little ſaffron, and ſo giuen. All theſe

aforeſaide are very good againſt the flowing of the gall, and alſo for the iaundice, Another for the ſame: take the yelke of an egge, and mixe it with ſome harde ſoot, powder of Peper, and hony, and put the egge ſhel and al down his throat, Quod Willis, then giue him a little chamberlye, and hee ſhal dowel.
               
               
                  To helpe a beaſt that is gored.
                  IF any beaſt chaunce to be ſtricken and gored with ſome of his fellowes, for feare of ſome gargel come thereof, or ſome impoſtume to growe and bréede thereof. The remedie, yee ſhall take of aſhes finely ſifted, and mixe them with the groundes of ale or béere, and make it thicke like a batter, and ſo laye it thereon, vſe this and it will heale it. Another: ſome doe take vnto the ſaide groundes or dregges of ale, of vnquenched lime finely beaten, and ſo mixt well together, and ſo laie it theretoo. Another: ſome puts in ſtéed of aſhes, redde earth, or oaker, mixt like wiſe together as aforeſayd, and ſo layes it too plaiſterwiſe. Another: likewiſe a playſter of pitch, is alſo good to be layde thereon. And all the other aforeſayde are very good to heale a beaſt that is gorde or hurt.
               
               
                  Againſt the turning diſeaſe in cattel.
                  THere is a certain diſeaſe comes to ſome cattel, called (of huſband mē) y• turning diſeaſe. Which diſeaſe in eating their meat wil cauſe thē to turn about & let their féeding ſore & alſo thoſe cattell which are troubled with this diſeaſe, are alwaies in dāger of falling into pits and ditches & ſuch like. The cauſe is, there lieth a bledder vnder the ſkul in the forehead of the beaſt, which is betwéen the braine and the brayn pan, which bladder muſt be taken foorth, or hee wil neuer amend, but in y• end he wil die therof. The remedy is, ye muſt caſt him and bind his 4. féete together, and there ye ſhal feele al ouer ſoftly with your thumbe thruſting theron, & wheras yee finde the ſofteſt place, a litle there aboue yee ſhall cutte

the ſkinne ouerthwart, foure ynches, & ſo lykewiſe beneath the ſoft place. Then alſo in the middes ye ſhall cut the ſkin downward between the two ouerthwart cuts, & flea thoſe ſkins on both ſides, then turne them vp, and pynne them with pyns. Then take a ſharpe knife and cutte the brayne panne there vnder two ynches broade, and thrée ynches lōg: but beware your knife goe no deeper then the thickneſſe of the brayne pan for pearcing the brayne, (For if ye do ſo the beaſt wil dye,) Then ye ſhal take away that cut boane, & yee ſhal ſee a bledder there vnder two ynches or more long ful of water. Which bledder ye ſhal ſoftly take clean away, and ſee that yee hurt not his braine. So done, then ye ſhall laye downe againe the cut ſkin as before, and ſow them faſt together: then bynde a lynnen cloth thrée or foure folde, dipt in freſh greace and tarre, and layde thereon, which wil keepe it from winde and colde for the ſpace of ten or twelue dayes, which ſkinne wil ſo grow againe, and he ſhall doe well. And herevpon I haue ſeene (ſaith mine Author) many recouer and doe well. But for the more ſurety (when a beaſt is troubled with this diſeaſe being flat, or hauing any reaſonable fleſh on him) is to kyl hym, and ſo there is but ſmall loſſe. The like diſeaſe yee ſhal haue in young ſheepe, which is ſpoken of in his place.
               
               
                  Thinges good for ſinewes and to knit bones.
                  VVHen as there ſhall chaunce anye bones of your cattell to be broken, yee ſhal take of the herbe called in Latine Aron, in Engliſh, Cuckoſpit, ſtampe thereof with barley meale and a little hony, and ſo playſterwiſe lay it to. Another: take of the herbe called in Latine ſymphitum, in Engliſh cumphory, bruiſe of the leaues and roote, with a litle hony, and laye it to playſterwiſe. Another: take of yarrow and ſtampe it with ſwines greace, and playſterwiſe lay it to, which will knyt not bones onely, but ſinewes alſo. Another: take the tender buddes of the Aſhe tree, ſtamp them

with ſhell ſnailes or blacke ſnayles, and ſo lay it too, or take the powder made of the barke of an Aſhe trée, mingle and beate it with the leaues of cumphory, and then laie it too. Another, ſéeth the barke of an Elme trée, in running water, then bruiſe it and lay it to. All theſe aforeſaide are good to comfort ſinewes, and for the knitting of bones.
               
               
                  To breede calues and to gelde them
                  IF ye wil bréede calues to make young bulles, take no calf that is calued within the prime, which is counted the fiue daies after the change, for thoſe will not proue well, as ſome huſbands ſaie. Nor likewiſe alſo any calfe (or other) then calued, is not good for to keepe, but to eate or ſell, & among a hundred calues, two ſhalbe ſufficiēt for to make buls: as for al the reſt; it ſhalbe beſt to geld them ſoone after they are calued, or at 2. yéeres of age, & then to lay vpō the ſores y• aſhes of vine twigges, burnt and mixt with litarge. And on the 3. daie after, ye may melt of tarre, and mingle of the ſaid aſhes therewith, and annoint therewith for feare of ſwelling. Alſo the manner of gelding of Calues, Mago doth counſel and ſay, y• calues would be gelded when they are are young and tender, not with any yron? But with a clouen hazel ſticke & ſo preſſed together, and then race the codde by little and little til it be conſumed. This he taketh to be the beſtway of gelding, when they are young and tender, for this kinde of waie is done with owten wound.
                  For when a calfe is ſomwhat bigge, he would better tarry vnto two yéeres, then to geld him at one yeere, which to geld them is beſt in Autumne, when the moone is in decreaſing, and the ſigne from that place, yee ſhall then caſt him and traues his feete together, and before yee touch him with yron, yee muſt take vp his ſtones, then take two ſtreight lathes like rulers of wood, made like a paire of barnicles or tonges. Then take vp the ſtones with the nerfes and ſtringes that the ſtones doe hang by, then cloſe your

tongs vnder betwixt his body & his ſtones, cloſe them harde together (leauing the ſtones on the outſide thereof,) ſome gelders make them of yron for the more ſtrength. Then ſlit the purſe firſt of one codde, and put foorth the ſtone thereat, and cut him off within hard by the ſaide tongs and cloſe by the nerfs, and ſo likewiſe take foorth the other ſtone, and then ſome doe ſeare it for bléeding too much, and annoyntes it with freſh greace and lets him goe, but ſee to cut them in ſuche ſort, that yee leaue the endes of the ſtringes ioyning to the ſaide nerfes: for thereby hee ſhall not looſe much of his bloud, nor ſhall not bée all feminate, nor yet very ſtout of his members, in leauing ſtill the forme of the male, although the force of engendering be taken away, the which Horſe gelt or Bull. he will not ſodainly looſe by and by after he is gelt, for when a horſe or bul is gelt, they wil (if ye wil ſuffer them,) couer incontinent, and certainly engēder, which ye ſhal not ſuffer none ſo to do, for feare leaſt they die of the bloudie fluxe, but after ye haue ſo dreſſed him, ye ſhal annoint him with freſhe greace. Some doe annoynt after he is cut, with the aſhes of the tender vine branches, mixt with the ſkinne of ſiluer, thē ye ſhall giue them no drinke for the ſpace of thrée or foure dayes, but to eate of greene herbes, and giue him but little thereof, for ye ſhall nouriſhe him as though hee were ſicke, in giuing him the croppes of trees and greene herbes. The leaſt danger in gelding an olde beaſt, is a Boare, all other beaſtes are more, daungerous beyng gelded when they are olde.
                  Some doe vſe a kind of gelding young calues or fooles (as I haue heard) vnder nine daies, or aſſoone as the ſtones deſcended A kind of gelding. downe into the codde, they wil by and by take him & knitte ſoftly the purſe of the codde betwixt the ſtones and his bodie with a ſhoemakers threed, and as the foale doeth grow & increaſe, the ſtones will conſume and weare away, which kinde of gelding (as I haue learned) they doe vſe in the North partes.
                  
                     Ariſtotle ſaith, it is ieopardy in gelding al kind of cattell beeyng olde, except 
                        •
                     ara be: and likewiſe it is beſt gelding

in the increaſe of the moone, for it will make them growe faire, large, and bigger than thoſe which are gelded in the wayne of the moone, ſo that ye gelde or ſpay in a good ſigne. Alſo in cutting or letting blood, theſe ſignes are counted moſt daungerous, if the Moone haue power ouer them. As Taurus, Leo, Gemini, Virgo, and the latter part of Libra, and Scorpio, and alſo the two ſignes gouerned vnder Saturne, as Capricorne and Aquarius. The reſt are all good, as Aries, Cancer, Sagittarius and Piſces, ſo that the Moone be not in them.
                  Alſo ye ſhal note, that if the ſigne bee comming within a daie of the cut place, it ſhall not then bee ſo good to cut with out a more daunger, as when the ſigne is once paſt the place. For a greene wounde beeing newly cutte, the ſigne comming nigh vnto it, will cauſe it to bleede afreſhe, beeyng but a little moued, or elſe to growe and bréede to ſome impoſtumation of blood or other humours, which hath byn often ſéene among cattell, whereby they haue died thereof, but to gelde your calues when they are but young is counted beſt. As when they are of ſixe or eight weekes olde, for elſe (as ſome huſbandes ſaie) they will not commonly proue ſo faire nor ſo good to weane. If any calfe do ſwel after he is new glded, ſome doe vſe to burne one of his ſtones to powder, and ſo beate it ſmall, and caſt it thereon, and ſome doe mixe it with neates foot oyle, and ſo annoints the ſore place therewith.
               
               
                  The charge to the keeper and gouernour of cattell.
                  THe kéeper and gouernour of cattel muſt alwayes be diligent to foreſee that his cattel haue meate in due ſeaſon, & that his ſtalles be cleanely kept, and that no poultrie, hens, or duckes, or hogges doe vſe at any time the ſaide ſtalles. For the feathers of poultrie is vnholeſome for cattell, and alſo their doung bréede the murraine in cattell as ſome doe iudge, and the doung alſo of hogges doeth them no

good, and likewiſe the lice of hogges will make them vnquiet and ſcabby. Alſo the kéeper ought to rubbe them daily that labour and to kembe them with a carde, which will make them the luſtier, and to waſhe their feete with colde water when they labour not, will doe well, Yée ſhall alſo know the force and age of an oxe in viſiting his mouth, for he wil caſt his two formoſt teeth within ten moneths of his firſt yeere, and within ſixe weekes after that, hee will caſt the two next teeth vnto them, and about the ende of three yeeres, he will chaunge and caſt them all. And when they are growen all full vp agayne, they will then bee all equall, white and long. But when the Oxe beginneth to waxe olde, they will returne and waxe crooked and blacke and likewiſe vnequall. Alſo for Oxen to labour, the black The labouring Oxe. Oxe and the redde oxe are the beſt, and the brown or gréeſeled Oxe are next, the white Oxe is worſt of al colours. An Oxe wil ſerue well to labour til he be of ten yeeres, not after ſo good, for he wil then waxe dull, weake & feeble. Wherfore then it were beſt to feede him and ſo to ſell him: an oxe will liue wel 15, or 16. yeeres. Alſo wilde oxen are better to beare a burden than to labour, for they are neuer ſo free nor ſo ſtrong to drawe and labour, as the tame Oxen are. Likewiſe it is not good to labour with any bul among your oxen, Bul te labour. for he wilbe ſtubborne and ſullen, and loues to be a maiſter ouer the reſt, whereby he wil but trouble them. Therfore it ſhalbe alwaies beſt to keepe the bulles luſtie and fat, to couer alwaies your kine, ſo ſhal ye ſtil haue faire calues and large withal: one good and luſty bul is ſufficient for threeſcore kine.
                  Likewiſe kine to be put to ye bul, ye beſt & chiefeſt times is in May, June, & July, then ye kine ſhould be put to ye bul before Kine put to the bull. they haue bin in any good paſture: for ſome huſbāds ſaith: a leane cowe will take, and ſooner be with calfe then a fatte cowe. If a cow with make deſire the bull, if ſhee bee milked incontinent before, ſhee will not then take nor deſire the bull, if then ſhe haue no bul, & leeſe her make, ſhe wil deſire the bull about a moneth after againe, thus ſome

huſbands haue proued, and the bull the contrarie. For he muſt be fat and luſty when he ſhall couer the kine, or els thoſe calues will be weake. A cow will liue well 15. yeares, but after ſhe will waxe féeble and weare. Alſo ye ſhall not let a cow take the bull before ſhe be three yeare olde. For when young kine go to the bull, they bring forth commonly ſmall and weake calues: therefore ſome huſbands will neuer weane the firſt calfe of a cow. And alſo ye ſhall not put your kine vnto the bull before the third or fourth day of Iune, to the ende that ſhe may (by the vertue in eating of hearbes and graſſe) be the more hot and luſty as to take the bull when ſhe ſhalbe put vnto him. Wherefore ſome huſbands (to make a cow take the bull the ſooner) do giue her of the hearbe called cowmake, which groweth like a white gilloflower among corne. Then to keepe her a little hungry, and to giue her therof, two houres before ſhe ſhall take the bull, and that will put her in more heat, and ye ſhal then rub her naturall cundit with nettles, which is alſo good, if ſhee wil refuſe the bull. Some huſbands do counſell not to ſuffer your kine to be conered vnder foure yeres, and likewiſe not after twelue yeares, becauſe the one is too young, and the other is too olde.
                  And alſo they ſay, the beſt time to put the bull with the kine is, all the month of Iuly. For then the kine will bring their calues in ver, in the beginning and ſpring of hearbes and graſſe: ye need not conſtraine her then to take the bull, for the aboundance of hearbes will prouoke and put her in heat, ſo that ye ſhall not then conſtraine her. A cow will go with calfe ten monethes. If a cow refuſe, or the bull wil not couer her, ye ſhal make them haue appetite, as it is ſpoken of among the horſes and mares, and as it is afore rehearſed: and then ye ſhall diminiſh her paſture, to the ende that the aboundance of graſſe do not make her barren, for a cow being fat, will ſmally deſire the bull, and when ſhe hath taken, ye may iudge by refuſing the bull, and alſo to knowe whether ſhe ſhall haue a cow calfe or bull calfe, ye ſhall vnderſtand, if the bull deſcend from her on the right ſide of her,

more then the leaſt, is to iudge a bull calfe: and likewiſe the contrarie if he deſcend on the leaſt ſide. Or if the com in deſcending and lying downe on the right ſide, is to iudge ſhee hath a bull calfe. And if ſhe lye downe on the left ſide, is to iudge a cow calfe. And when ye ſhal iudge ſhe hath taken by refuſing the bul, which thing doth not alwaies happen true, for although ſhe haue taken, yet many kine be not ſatiſfied, for ſome brute beaſtes will haue a voluptuous deſire aboue nature, as wel as other creatures.
                  Alſo to nouriſh your kine and calues, in countries where there is great ſtore of paſture, they may nouriſh their calues all the yere. But where there is ſmall ſtore of paſture, it wil ſcant ſuffice them from two yeare to two yeare: And ye may nouriſh your calues of their dammes for one yeares ſpace. But that yeare thoſe kine muſte not bee charged with any kind of labour. Alſo when a cow hath calued, ſome huſbands will after the calfe hath ſuckt iii. wéekes, take away a tet, & milke it cleane: the next wéeke another tette, & ſo the thirde. Thus they will haue milke plentie, and yet many kine wil kéepe milke inough to ſerue for her calfe. If a cow paſſe x. yeares, ſhe is not then ſo good to bring calues as before. If a young cow calue before thrée yeares, ye ſhall take away the calf, and milke her firſt thrée daies together, becauſe ſhe ſhal not then be charged with to much milke. Then milke her no more but let the calfe haue al the reſt: If ye will drye vp her milke, ye ſhal noint her vdderne all ouer with tarre. Kine deſire not ſo much to drinke of the riuer water as of ponde water, becauſe the water of the riuer is more colder then the ponde water: Which riuer water being ſo colde, will chyll her within, and make her in danger to caſt her calfe, if God worke not the contrarie. Notwithſtanding among all great cattell, the cow will lightly abide the moſte coldeſt ayre. Wherefore they commonly let them lye without the dores all the winter in moſt places and countries.
               
               
                  
                  The gouernment of cattel, and the ordering of kine with their calues.
                  
                     STephanus ſaith, to order cattell, and to nouriſh kine orderly and wel, the huſband man muſt ſée himſelfe, or els haue ſome truſty and ſkilful man, to looke and often reſort vnto his cattel, as oxen or kine in the ſtall, or without, and to féed or ſée that they haue ſufficient meat and water dayly at conuenient times, morning and euening, and to ſée when any beaſt is ſickly to helpe him with medicine, and to make their ſtawles for cattell to lye in, to ſet it eaſt and weſt, with windowes and dores towardes the ſouth, and cloſe toward the north, for that is very ſharpe and cold in winter for cattell: And to ſtrow of beaten ſalte all ouer on the boordes or ſtones vnder them, becauſe (they ſay) it is a manifeſt thing to keepe their bodies in health: And they do vſe to ſtrawe ſome ſand or grauell, vnder their cattell, on the plankes for ſliding whereby they maie ſtand the better, without ſliding, and likewiſe to ſee them haue litter at euenings after their labour.
                  And when yee ſhall put them foorth in the ſpring with your kine, yee ſhall ſeparate the young ſucking calues aſſoone as they haue ſuckt their dammes, yee ſhall put them into ſome ſeuerall houſe or other place, where they ſhall remaine all the day, and when yee will haue them ſucke, yee ſhall let them foorth to their dammes, and let them ſucke but euening and morning, and ſo ſhut them vp againe in the houſe, for by this order the calues ſhal waxe more fayrer and alſo ſooner fat, then roming ſtill with their dammes. Alſo when a cow hath calued, if ſhe be not then well kept (although ſhe be a good nourſe) ſhe ſhal not be able to nouriſh wel her calfe: therefore they do vſe to giue kine with calfe, of ye greene hearbe cald melilot, they ſtamp it with ſome hony, & lay it al a night to ſoke in milke, and ſo giue it her like a medicine: for that is counted marueilous good for a cow with

calfe or other beaſt. Likewiſe againe, they do ſtampe peaſe with wine, and ſo giues it them: and let the farmers wife, aſſoone as your calues be take vp, to put the milke apart, that butter and cheeſe may be made thereof without anye maſt, and ſee to alwaies that your chéeſe be well and cloſe gathered, in preſſing forth cleane all the whay (for whay remayning in the curdes, will make the cheeſe waxe ſower, and aire will make it full of holes.) And likewiſe that your pots be well ſcalded and cleane waſhed, with other your veſſels thereunto belonging, or els veſſels with chéeſe fats and ſuch, will make your chéeſe waxe ſower alſo. And likewiſe that your womē ſeruants touch no butter nor chéeſe hauing their monthes termes on them, for that is very vnholſome.
                  Moreouer when as ye ſhall ſee a labouring oxe that laboreth dayly, bate no part of his fleſh, but remaines ſtill fat and in good lyking, which is no good ſigne: for hee is full of flegme.
                  Therefore ye ſhall euery viij. daie, open his mouth and waſh it with his owne piſſe, and thereby ye ſhall draw forth much flegme thereat, which otherwiſe he would ſtill ſwallow downe. Which flegme oftimes will moleſt and grieue him to eate his meate: for by the aboundance of flegme doth cauſe him to haue the catar of reume, which ye ſhal perceius when he is troubled therewith, by watering of his eyne, for they will ſéeme very watry: and when they drop water, hee will then hang downe his eares. Then ye ſhal take him and waſh his mouth with time bruſed in white wine, and therupon rub his mouth with garlicke, and fine ſalte mixt together: ſo done, then waſh his mouth againe with wine as before.
                  Some do clenſe the ſaid flegme with bay leaues beaten with the barke of pomgarnets, and ſo mixt with wine and waſh therewith. And other ſome do ſquirt wine mixt with mirre, into their noſtrels: but for the reume or catarre, if his eies do inflame, ye ſhall but let him bloud on the vaine vnder his tongue, and ſo ye ſhall remedy it.
               
               
                  
                  To helpe a cow of the whetherd.
                  TO helpe a cow that is whetherd, that is, when ſhee hath newly calued and hath not caſt her cleaning, ſhe wil dye of it ſhortly after. To make her voide and caſt the ſame, yee ſhall take a good quantity of the iuice of mallows, and mixe it with ale or wine and giue it, which is good to repulſe the latter birth after the cow haue calued. Another. Take mugwoort, ſtamp and ſtraine it with ale and ſo giue it, which wil both clenſe the latter birth, and alſo bring forth the dead calfe within hir. Another. Take of Ariſtolochia, do bruſe & mixe it with myrre and pepper, and then giue it with white wine or ſtrong ale, which doth caſt forth the latter burthen. Another. Stampe a good handfull of penirial, and ſtraine it with ale and ſo giue it, which will put forth the latter burthen. Another. Bruſe a good handfull of betonie leaues, ſtraine it with honied water & then giuen: which doth driue forth the ſecond birth. Alſo take of ſyler montaine, ſtampe it and then ſtraine it with wine and ſo giue it: which is good to clenſe and driue forth the latter burthen. Alſo they do vſe to giue when a cow is whetherd, of ſmoaked barly, which barly is but ſinged in the ſtraw and ſo giuen, and ſhe wil eate thereof: any one of theſe afore ſaid, is good againſt the ſaide diſeaſe, if ye ſhall ſee knots in the mouth then iudge ſhe hath not cleand of her birth: then muſt ye take them from her, or ſhe will dye.
               
               
                  To helpe a beaſt prickt with a thorne.
                  YE ſhal take a bettle fly, cald of ſome a ſhumbarbe, which crepeth commenly on horſe dung, or other dung, ſlit his belly but kil him not, and lay to the cut place, where ye thorne went in. If any thing will helpe this will do it, but ſome what painefull a whyle. Another. Take the blacke ſnaile that beareth no ſhel, bruſe it and lay it to. Another. Shaue ye roots of red roſes, and put thereto of blacke ſope, and ſo lay it to. Another. Take agrimony, rue, marigoldes, of ech a like quantity, ſtampe them all together mixt with a little ſalt, &

ſo lay it to. Another. Take of the root of barbery trée, bruſe it and laie it to, which will draw forth either thorne or iron out of the bone.
               
               
                  How to viſite and ouerſee your cattell from time to time.
                  YE muſt often ouerſée and viſit your troupes of cattell, a—gainſt anie infirmitie, that may daily hap, and to chuſe & take forth the olde cattell from the young, ſo muſt yee likewiſe take your kine which are barren frō the other, becauſe they will beare no more, and yet occupie the place of the bearing kine. Which barren kine ye may rather fat them, or occupie them to the plough, for they may as wel indure labour and trauaile, as the young oxe, becauſe being barrē they are as light. They delight to be in ſunnie places in winter ny
                        •
                      ſea, and in ſummer to be in thick ſhadie woods, and they loue more the paſture on mountaines, then on the plaines, and alſo their hoofes wil better indure in forreſts and gras woods or in places of clay or marris grounds, then in hard & ſtonie places.
               
               
                  Things good to purge cattel.
                  THe powder of ix. or xv. leaues of laurel, or the gréene leaues thereof beaten, and ſtraind with a pint of honied water, mixt with a little ſalt, then ſtraind and giuen to the beaſt in the morning: this wil purge ſomewhat ſtrong.
                  Alſo the leaues of the elder, bruſed and ſod in water, then ſtraind and ſo giuen, doth purge both choller & flegm downward: And alſo it doth clenſe water out of the ſtomach. Alſo the beries of elder ſtampt and ſtraind with ale or beere doth ye like. Or the inner rinde which is gréene, taken & ſtampt wt wine, and ſo let it ſtand cold all a night, and then ſtraine it in the morning and giue it warme. Or likewiſe the low elder, cald danewoort, which wil do the like, and in all pointes it wil purge both choller and flegme, as wel as the other elder:

and (as ſome do iudge) it is good to be giuen cattel in the time of plague or morren among beaſts.
                  Likewiſe ye may take of ſpurge which giueth like milke, take a good handful thereof, ſtampe it, and then ſtraine it, with a pint or more of water and vinegar in like portion, and ſo giue it: this will purge both choller and flegme. Alſo xx. or xxx. of the ſéedes therof ſed in honied water mixt with a little ſalt, then bruſe them, and ſo giue it, which doth purge more ſtronger.
                  Another. Ye may take a good handful of Centory, of the tops, leaues and flowers, boile it in a quart of ale or béere, til a quarter be waſted, then ſtraine it and giue it warme: this ye may miniſter at al times (if the ſigne do ſerue) and it will gently purge both choller and flegme, but chiefely choller, & keepe him in the houſe (if it be cold) vi. houres after,
                  Another. Ye ſhall take a handful of the rootes of polypodium (which is the ferne that groweth on the oke.) choppe it ſmal, & then bruſe it, and mixe it with a quart of honied water, and ſo giue it warme. In ſummer ye may take likewiſe a good handful of the branches, and vſe it as the other afore ſaid: this doth purge both choller and flegme, but chiefelye flegme. Another. Ye ſhal take a good handful of the crops of broome being gréene, then bruſe it, and put vnto it a pint or more of honied water, or ſtrong ale, and let it reſt ſo al night, then on the morrow ſtraine it and giue it warme. If ye wil make it more ſtronger, ye may put into it, two drams of the ſéed made into powder, and then it wil work more ſtronger.
                  Another. Take of Sene of Alexandria, with a peniworth of anniſeſéedes, then boile them in a quart or more of ale, till a quarter thereof be waſted, then ſtraine it, and ſo giue it warme, this doth purge very gētly. Alſo the ſene romana, y• is here growing in diuers gardens (as at Lambeth houſe) take iii. drams of the ſéed made into powder, wt the powder of anniſeſéede, & thē mixt with a pint of ſtrong ale, & ſo giuen warme, and this wil purge more ſtronger. Another. Take vi. drams of the roote of flourdeluce made into

powder, and mixe it with a pinte or more of honied water, and ſo giue it warme. The more proportion ye giue, of al theſe aforeſaid, the ſtronger they will be to worke. Wherefore ye muſt vſe them with diſcretion, and as ye ſhall ſée cauſe, for ye may aſwell giue too much as to little: and as y• beſt is, when ye do giue them any drinke to purge, to kéepe them in winter warme after, a day and a night and ſo they ſhall do wel, God willing. The beſt ſignes to giue them drinke is, Scorpio, and piſces.
                  
               
               
                  To make a ſtawle or frame to giue your cattell drinkes when ye ſhall ſee any cauſe.
                  COlumella ſaith, it ſhalbe very neceſſarie of good huſbands to make a ſtaule or frame, to giue your beaſts drinke in when ye ſhal ſee néed: Which ye ſhall make like vnto thoſe that the ferrours or ſmithes do vſe for ſhooing of their vngracious horſes. Which faſhion ye ſhal make thus, ye ſhall firſt pitch your 4. corner poſtes faſt in the ground, and then planke it in the bottome: then ſhall ye planke the ſides with foure ſtrong barres of a ſide, well and faſt made to the foure corner poſtes, which poſtes muſt be at leaſt vii. foot hye, then croſſe thoſe bars on the out ſides with iii. croſſe barres, and let the entrance be foure foote wide, ſo that the beaſt maye eaſily enter in, and there ſet with vi. bar res behinde. So when the beaſt is in, he cannot retyre nor returne on neither ſide thereof, nor yet ſtirre backward nor forward. Alſo ye muſt haue two barres before, and a ſtrong croſſe barre thereon, and as they tye their horſes with their halters, ſo muſt ye tye vp their hornes, that ye maye giue them drinke more eaſier: thus being tyed his head faſt vnto the barre within, his feete ſhall not then ſtraine without the ſtall but reſt within on the plankes: And to order him that hee ſhall not aſcende with his bodie, yee muſte bynde his body downe to the barres, to make that yee ſhall not ſtirre no waye to hurt him, but ſhall bee at commaundement to receyue the medicine, and this order yee

may vſe for all your great cattel, and thereby to kéepe them in health from time to time.
               
               
                  How to fat an Oxe.
                  
                     STephanus ſaith, ye may fat an oxe ſoon wt fetches, peaſe, boiled barley, or beanes huſked and bruiſed, and yee may alſo fat an oxe wel with hay, but not to giue him as ye giue vnto a horſe, if ye giue him in ſommer of the tender braunches of trées, it wil refreſh him, if yee giue an oxe onely akornes, it will make him ſcabbie, except the akornes bee dried and mixed with branne, or ſuche like. Alſo an Oxe that ye intend to make fat, and ſo to bargain and ſel, ye may labour him in faire times once or twice a weeke in gentle groundes, and to labour him now and then a little for exerciſe; it wil make him haue a better ſtomake to his meat, and let him eate nothing but barley, and hay, and ſometimes a little herbes or vine branches, or other tender branches, that he loueth, ſo ſhal he be in good order. Alſo to fat an oxe yee ſhal giue him ground beanes, dried barley, or Elme leaues, but ſpecially goyng in the ſonne doth make him like well, & to waſh him twiſe or thriſe a wéeke with warme water. Alſo colewoortes to boyle with branne, doeth make them haue ſoluble bellies, and it doth nouriſh as much as doth barley. Likewiſe chaffe mixed with ground beanes, is good ſometimes, your oxen are leſſe ſubiect to diſeaſes thē your horſe: yet to preſerue and kéepe them in health, our elders did vſe to purge them euery quarter three daies together, one with lupin peaſe, another with the graine of Cipres, beatē in like quantitie, ſtéeped al one night before, in a pint or a pint and a halfe of water and ſo giuen. Others do giue other thinges according to the vſe of the countrie.
                  Againe, if any Oxe doe waxe weake and feeble in labour, they do vſe to giue him once a moneth, of fetches beaten and ſteeped in water, and mixt with beaten branne, and to keep an oxe from being weary, they doe vſe now and then to rub his hornes with turpentine, mixt with oyle oliue. But ſee

that ye touch no other part of his head, but his hornes, for if yee ſo doe, it wil at length hurt his ſight. Alſo there will be ſometimes ariſing come ouer the heart of an Oxe. ſhewing thereby as though he woulde vomite, to helpe the ſame, yee ſhall rubbe and chafe his mouzell and mouth with bruſed garlicke, or els with beaten léekes, and then force him to ſwallow it downe.
               
               
                  Againſt the Collicke in cattell
                  YE ſhall giue chiefly for the ſame vnto your oxe of bruiſed garlicke with wine, or bruiſed leekes mixt with a pinte of wine, & alſo againſt the gurling or rumbling in the belly, and noyſe of his guttes, which yee ſhal vnderſtande when he complaineth thereof, yee ſhall often ſee him lye downe, and ſodainly to riſe vp agayne, becauſe yee cannot for paine reſt long in a place, to helpe the ſame, ſome doe vſe to put vnto his drinke the oile of nuttes. Others do giue him of onions boyled in ſweete wine, and ſome do giue of mirre, with the pouder of baies ſteeped in wine, and alſo they doe pricke his ſkinne all about the clees of his féete, or to pricke vnder his tayle, ſo long till it begin to bléede, and ſo he ſhal amend.
               
               
                  Times beſt to ſtop laxes.
                  THe chiefeſt times to ſtoppe fluxe or laxe is, when the moone or ſigne is in Taurus, Virgo or Capricorne, thē to giue your beaſt drinkes to ſtoppe it ſhall doe beſt, but to purge by drinkes as afore is mentioned, y• is, when the ſigne is chieflie in Scorpio and Piſces. Alſo it is not good to purge or let blood (without great néed) in ye change of the moon, neither when there is any euil aſpect of one planet vnto another, nor in the ſignes of Capricorne & Aquarius, for they are ye two houſes of Saturne, neither when the moone is afflicted with Saturne & Mars. Thus if al theſe rules aforeſaid bee obſerued and kept, thinges wil woorke the better, & your

cattel thereby the better be preſarued.
               
               
                  The forme and qualitie of a Bull.
                  FOrſomuch as I haue ſomewhat ſpoken afore of Oxen, I will here take opportunitie to ſpeake ſomwhat of the Bul and of his forme, which is, thoſe Buls which ought to bee praiſed, they ought to haue long and great members, and alſo to be gentle and of a meane age, the blacke and the redde Buls are the beſt. The reſt yee muſt conſider to haue all thinges in him as in the oxe, for there is no difference betwixt a good Bull and a good Oxe, ſaue that the Bull ought to haue a quicker looke, and his hornes to bee more ſhorter, likewiſe his necke more fleſhy, inſomuch as it is the greateſt part of his bodie and the ſtrongeſt to the proportion of the reſt, his belly long, ſlender and ſtreight, whereby hee maie the more eaſier couer the kine, thus much for the Bul and his proportion.
               
               
                  The forme and qualitie of a faire Cowe.
                  COlumella ſayeth, a Cowe of eſtimation ought to bee large and long bodyed, and alſo to bee gentle, hauing a large and deepe bellie, a broade forehead, and blacke open eyne, with faire and blacke pulliſhed hornes: her eares rough and hayrie, her iawes well ſhutte, the fanne of her tayle great, the clawes and hornes of her féete ſmall, her legges ſhort and thicke, her breſt deepe, al the reſt like vnto the male, and ſpecially to bee young: for when a Cowe ſhall paſſe tenne yeeres, ſhee maie not ſo well beare calues.
                  Alſo Stephanus ſaith, the farmer hauing good vnderſtanding, ſhal alwaies eſtéeme the Cow of a meane ſtature, and being but foure or fiue yeeres old, the browne colour mirte with white ſpots is good, with the redde and the blacke, alſo to haue a large deep belly, broad for head, black eyne & great,

cleane hornes and blacke, her eares rough, her iawes narrow ſette, her mouzell great, her haire ſomewhat crumpled, her hoofes little and ſmally clouē, her legs ſhort, her thighes thicke and round, her vdderne large and deepe, hauing but foure tettes, her necke long and thicke, her breſt large & deep hanging, her feete broade and thicke. Theſe are the chiefeſt poyntes belonging to a fayre cow.
               
               
                  How to keepe a Cow that is great bellied with calfe.
                  
                     STephanus ſith, ye muſt keepe your kine with calfe from dangers, from the tenth moneth, for then ſhee waxeth great bellied, and alſo in winter if ſhe be then with calfe, ye ſhal nouriſh her in the ſtal from the eight moneth, becauſe of extreme colde, and then to giue her of good meate, it ſhall doe wel. But in Sommer ye ſhall giue her the braunches of tender bruiſe of trees, ſuch as ye can get, and vſe her not after two moneths to faſt, but let her feed on mornings in the fieldes, and ſo to milke her, and giue her alſo in the euening freſh forrage when ſhe commeth to the houſe. And likewiſe in the morning before ſhe goeth to the fielde, and when ſhe haue calued, ye ſhal keepe backe the calfe, when ſhe goeth to fielde, and ſo vſe her ſtil as ye ſhal ſee cauſe. And when to gelde as aforee is mentioned. Some doe vſe to geld To gelde calues. when the calues are young, and ſome lets them run a yeere or more before they geld, which is counted more dangerous. Therfore, as moſt doe vſe, to geld vnder the damme is beſt: then after their gelding, ye muſt kéepe them wel in good paſtures, that they may be the more readier and ſtronger to labour at 2. yeeres. They doe vſe alſo to labour their barren Kine to labor. kyne after nine yeeres, when as they bring no more calues. Therefore they are put vnto the vſe of drawing in the yoke as the oxen are. Alſo if calues bee not gelded Gelt of calues within one yeere, they wil not be greate, if there growe an impoſtume after gelding, burne his ſtones to aſhes, & caſte that powder thereon, and it wil helpe.
               
               
                  
                  How to buy leane kine or cattell.
                  
                     FItz harbart ſaith, and if a man by leane kine or oxen to féede, yee muſt ſee they be young, for the yonger they bée the ſooner they will feede, and looke well that their hayre ſtare not, but that they doe vſe to licke themſelues, and ſée alſo they bee whole mouthed in wanting none of theyr teeth. For although hee haue the goute, and broken both of tayle and pizell, yet will he feede, but an Oxe hauing the goute will not bee driuen farre, yee ſhall chooſe him with a broade ribbe, and a thicke hide, and not to be looſe ſkinned, nor yet ſticke harde to the ribbes or ſides. For then he will not feede ſo well. Alſo thoſe huſbandes that meane to thrine, muſt haue both Kine and Oxen, Horſe, mares, and young cattell, and to reare euery yeere ſome calues and foales, or els he ſhalbe conſtrayned to buy. If yee buy Oxen for the plough, ſee they bee young and not gowtie, nor yet broken haire of tayle nor pizell. Againe if yee buye kine to the payle, yee muſt ſee they bee young and (hauing ſuche properties as afore is mentioned.) Alſo gentle to mylke and likewiſe to nouriſhe vp theyr calues.
               
               
                  How to buy fat or leane cattell.
                  ALſo in buying other oxen or kine to fatte, yee ſhall firſt handle them and ſee if they be ſoft on the cropp
                        •
                      behind the ſhoulder, and alſo vppon the hindermoſt ryb, and vppon the huckle bone, and on the nathe by his tayle, and to ſee likewiſe if your Oxe haue a greate codde, and a Cowe, to haue a bigge nauill, for that is a good ſigne ſhe ſhoulde be well tallowed, yee muſt take heede alſo where yee buye anie leane cattell or fatte, and of whom and where they were bredde: for if ye buy from a better ground then yee haue your ſelfe, thoſe cattell will not ſo well like with you, yee ſhall alſo looke if there bee no manner

of ſickneſſe among thoſe cattel in the quarter or pariſhe where ye intend to buy, For if there be other murrē or long ſaugh, or other infectiue diſeaſe, it is great ieopardie buying any beaſt comming from thence. For one beaſt wil ſoon take ſickneſſe of another, which ſickneſſe will perhaps continue tenne or twelue yeeres or more, ere it wil appeare on him. If any beaſt chance to be ſicke, ye ſhal auoyde him ſoone from the reſt of his companie. Theſe and ſuch like rules, the buyer ought alwaies to haue reſpect, and take good heede thereof.
               
               
                  Againſt the murren or plague among Cattell.
                  AS for the murren or plague among cattell, there be mē enough (ſayeth he) that can helpe the ſame, beeing taken betimes. Which diſeaſe cōmeth of an infection of blood, and it appeareth commonly firſt in the head, for then his head wil ſwell, and his eyne waxe greate, and they wil runne of water. And when he doe once froth at the mouth, hee is then paſt remedie, but ſhortly after hee will dye, and yet when they are thus ſicke they will eate. The remedies are, yee ſhal flea the beaſt that is ſo dead, and burie him in a deepe pitte, and couer him wel with earth, that no dogges can come to the carrion. For ſo many beaſtes as do ſmell thereof, are like to be infected with the ſame diſeaſe, & therewith yee ſhall have the ſkinne ſtreight to the tanner, carrie it not home for feare of more peril maie fall thereof, there is a common vſe and done of a great charity, which is, they will put the beaſt ſkinne on a pole, and then ſette it in a hedge faſt bounde to a ſtake by the high waye ſide, that euery man ryding by, maie perceiue thereby where the ſickneſſe of cattell is, and alſo in what towneſhippe, and they holde an opinion it will thereby ceaſe the rather, which I doe ſcarcely beleeue. But a beaſt hauing the murren, being flead, it will appeare betwéene the fleſh and the ſkinne, for it wilbe as though it were full of froth

bubbles like bliffers, ſome blackiſh, ſome blewe, and ſome yellow, which wil commonly be in a fatte B

                      thicke and more déepe in the fleſh.
                  There haue beene ſome Beaſtes that haue dyed of the murren (as I haue beene credibly tolde) hee that fleade him died ſoone after, and he that went with it to the tanner, and the horſe that carried it, and the tanner that tanned it, all theſe died ſoone therevppon, which was thought it was by the infection of the ſtinking ſkinne, but beeing true, it was a maruellous infection. Wherefore it is thought good of ſome to burie them whole, for feare of a further inconuenience, this is thought good of ſome to take a ſmall corde and binde it harde about his necke, then on the farre ſide, yee ſhall feele a great vayne, and with a launcet. yee ſhall ſtrike thereon and lette him bloud, a pint or more, and ſo likewiſe on the other ſide of hys necke. Then take away the corde, and it will ſodaine ſtanche, but if the ſigne be there, he is in more daunger of bleeding ſtil. If he ſo doe, ye ſhall clappe to bruiſed nettles and ſalte, or wilde tanſie bruiſed and laide too, and ſome therefore doe giue them drinkes. Thus muſt yee ſerue al your cattell that are infected or beeyng together in one paſture, ſo doing, ye ſhal auoyde the greater danger in this diſeaſe. For the murren is taken by venoumed graſſe, by companie, and poiſoned water, and by hunger.
               
               
                  The rearing of Calues for encreaſe.
                  IT ſhall bée good for huſbandmen, to reare yearely ſo manie calues as they conueniently can keep to maintain his ſtocke, & chiefly thoſe calues that do fal betwixt candlemas & May, for in that ſeaſon their milke maie beſt bee ſpared, and by that time, there will bee ſufficient graſſe to weane them, and in Winter following, they will bée ſtrong enough to ſaue themſelues among other cattell, hauing

nowe and then ſome ſmall helpes, and alſo the Dams by Iune ſhalbe the readier againe to take the bull, & to bring other calues in the time aforeſaide, and if a Cow tarry til after May ere ſhe calue, The calfe wilbe too weak in ye winter, following: and the dam wil not be ſo ready to take the Bul againe, but thereby oft time go barren. Alſo to reare a calfe after Michaelmas, and to kéepe the dam at hard meate as they doe in ſome countries, it woulde be too coſtly al the Winter, and a cow abroade will giue more milke with a litle graſſe, then muche fodder lying in the cloſe houſe, or fed with hay and ſtraw remaining in the ſtall: for the drie and harde meate doth diminiſh more milke a great deale than graſſe. As for thoſe huſbandes that haue but ſmall paſture or none at all, muſt doe as they may, and in my minde, it were farre better for them to ſell theyr calues, than to reare them, whereby they may ſaue the milke to a more profite for the kéeping of his houſe, and the Cowe then wil the rather goe to the Bull againe.
                  Alſo if the huſband goe with an Oxe plough, it ſhalbe then meete to reare two Oxe calues, and two Cow calues yearely, to holde vp his ſtocke if he can ſo doe, and it wilbe the more profite. Alſo it is better to weane calues at graſſe, than at harde meate if they were at graſſe before. And thoſe that can haue ſeuerall paſtures for their kine & calues ſhall doe well and reare with leſſe coſte then others. The weaning of Calues with haye and water will make them haue great bellies, becauſe they ſtirre not ſo well therewith as with graſſe, and they will the rather rotte when they come to graſſe. And agayne in Winter they woulde bee put in houſes, rather than to remaine abroade, and to giue them but haye on nightes, and to paſture them in the day time. And thus beyng vſed, they ſhall bee muche better to handle when they ſhall be kine or oxen to ſerue to any other purpoſe.
               
               
                  
                  The loſſe of calfe, lambe, or fole, which is the leaſt loſſe.
                  YE ſhall vnderſtand, the leaſt hurt for the huſbandman is, his cow to caſt her calfe, then his eawe to caſt her lambe, or mare her colte, becauſe the calfe will ſucke ſo much milke as he is worth, before he ſhall be able to kill. And of the yowes milke, there cometh no profit but the lambe: yet in ſome countries they weane their lambes and milke their yowes, which is a hinderance for them to take the ramme in drie ſeaſon. But thereby oftimes goeth many yowes barren, becauſe they are brought ſo low with milking. Alſo if the the mare caſt her fole, that is thriſe ſo great a loſſe as the other two, for if that fole come of a good bréed, which is a moſt neceſſarie thing for euery man to prouide for himſelfe, and as much charge wil a bad mare coſt in keping, as a good mare, and with good keping the fole will be in ſhort time ready to ſell, for double ſo much money as the lambe, and calfe is worth.
               
               
                  What cattell are moſt meete to go in one paſture together.
                  YE ſhall vnderſtand, it is not ſo good nor ſo profitable, to haue cattel all of one ſort in a paſture together, as to haue all oxen, or all horſes in a paſture together, nor yet ſheepe alone except they paſture on high groundes, for they will not féed euen, but ouerrunne, and leaue many tufts of graſſe here and there vntouched in diuers places of the paſture: except it be greatly layd with cattell. Therfore ye ſhall perceiue that horſes will agrée well with other cattell in one paſture together, for there is ſome graſſe that horſes wil eate, and beaſts will not, and lightly a horſe will couet to féed after other cattell. Alſo a horſe loues to feede on low groundes, as plaſhes and hollow places. But horſes and ſhéepe will not ſo well agree together, except it be for the ſheepe to féede on the vpper

groundes. For a ſheepe will féed on a bare paſſure, & eate the ſwéeteſt graſſe, and ſo will a horſe likewiſe, but hee muſt haue it longer. Yet (as ſome do ſay) a horſe wil eate as nigh the ground as a ſheepe, but he cannot therewith fill his belly ſo ſoone. To one hundreth of cattell in a paſture, ye may haue xx. horſes, if it be a low ground. But if there be plenty of graſſe, then ye may put therein an hundreth ſhéepe mo: and ſo likewiſe to the rate of the goodnes of the Paſture, more or leſſe in cattell: and after this order yee maye eate your paſtures euen with cattell, and leaue but few tuftes of graſſe vneaten.
                  Alſo if it be a high ground, ye may then put in more ſhéep, and leſſe of other cattell. For manye kine and draught oxen, will eate a ground much barer then the fatting oxen or kine. And ye may alſo giue a mylch Cowe as well to much meat as to little: For to much meate will make her ſoone fatte, and then ſhee will the rather take the Bull: and ſhee being fatte will giue leſſer milke then a leanner cowe: For the fatnes ſtoppeth the poares of the raines which ſhould conueigh the milke vnto the vdderne. Wherefore a meane paſture is alwaies beſt to keepe your mylch kyne in, and to haue them in a good meane eſtate, neither to fatte nor to leane. Alſo if a Cowe bee fatte when ſhee ſhall calue, ſhee is in more daunger then being leane, and the calfe (ſhee being fatte) ſhall be the leſſe of ſtature. As for your draught oxen yee cannot giue them to much meate, except it bee the after graſſe of a lowe mowed meddowe. For that will cauſe them to haue the gyrrie, and then hee maye not away ſo well with labour. Likewiſe if there be very much graſſe in a cloſe, the cattell will feede the worſe therof, for better is a good ſwéete bitte from the earth, then a large and déepe graſſe. For where as it is long, the beaſts will byte of the toppes thereof and no more, for that is the ſweeteſt. And the other graſſe ſhall remayne ſtill on the grounde and ſo rotte, for no beaſt will eate thereof, but horſes onely in winter. For they will féede on foggie graſſe and ſuch like. Alſo ye ſhall vnderſtand that horſes

and cattell may not well be foddered in winter all together, but put apart, for the beaſtes with their hornes will gore both horſes and ſhéepe. Wherefore it is the more daunger ſo to féede them together: it is beſt therefore to make ſtanding rackes and cratches, and to caſt their meate therein: Which ſtaues ought to be ſet ſomewhat nigh together, for pulling and ſpoiling their fodder to much at once vnder their féete. It were rather better to change their places euery daye where ye feede them, which ſhould make them to gather vp more cleane, and not for to trample ſo much vnder their feete. Thus much as concerning the paſturing of cattell together in paſtures, and alſo the fothering of them together in winter.
               
               
                  A very good order for the fatting of oxen in the ſtawle.
                  VVHen ſoeuer you intend to fatte any oxen in the ſtawle, being in ſomer or winter to ſet them vp, if ye take them from graſſe in the ſommer, they will hardly fall to the eating of hay of a good while after, but when yee then take them vp, kéepe them ſo without meat and water one daye and a night, and ſo they will by extreme hunger forget the graſſe the rather, and then at the firſt giue them a little haye at once, whereby they may eate it vp cleane, and thereby waxe ſtill hungry. Ye muſt alſo take them vp into the ſtawle on a drie day, for if yee ſtawle them wette, they will haue (as ſome graſiers ſaye) warnell wormes on their backes, which will commonly come vnto them by famine & pouertie, and will hurt the ſkin. And alſo it wil make them be lowſie. Ye ſhall therefore vſe to kembe them with wool cards or horſe combe, as ſome do, & ſay it doth make thē more luſtier. But indéed that is good for the labouring oxen, ſo to be vſed, but not for the fatting oxe as ſome iudge: nor ye ſhal not let them go forth of the ſtawle at anye time, not ſo much as to drinke. For then they will deſire the

more to be abroad, & the licking of them wil hinder (as they ſay) their fatting. But ye ſhal ſo prouide that they may haue water brought them in cowles, or els to come through their ſtawles, as ſome do vſe, which is to ſet a woodden troffe along through their ſtawles, and with a pipe of lead and a cocke at the ende thereof, coming from a conduit or ceſterne, and thereby fils the ſaid troffe twiſe a day with freſh water, morning and euening, and at euery time before, to clenſe the troffe of all the olde water, and ſo to giue them freſh, for after they haue once drunke their fils of the freſh water, they wil lightly haue no more thereof, for they will blow theron, and after loth to drinke any more thereof vntill they haue freſh. For an oxe or cow is a beaſt that doth loue to feede ſwéete and clenly. Alſo ye ſhall lay your troffes ende ſomewhat a ſlope ſo that the water may run forth al at the one ende thereof, in taking forth a pin to let out the ſaid water: and then waſh the troffe cleane, and ſo giue them freſh. Thus ye muſt vſe them dayly morning and euening ſo long as ye fat them.
                  And firſt in the morning ye ſhal take away all their olde haye, and ſo clenſe their water troffe, and then giue them freſh water, and then a little freſh hay againe, & ſo at noone, and likewiſe at night: and thus to vſe them to be fedde from time to time. Alſo it ſhall be beſt to place and ſet their troffe on the farther ſide their crib nye vnto the wall, and to ſet it two foote hie and more, and their racks likewiſe woulde ſtand of a good height, as of iiii. foote or more, and to be made almoſt as broad beneath as aboue, for feare of tangling their hornes therein, and the rack ſtaues ſet not paſſing iiii. inches a ſunder: yet ſome do vſe to feede them on the ground without a racke, but that is thought to bee more duſtye and more waſtfull of haye. They do alſo giue them ſometimes for change, of wheate or barly chaffe, with the gurgins therof, for that after it (they ſay) wil make them to drinke well. But the hay is onely the chiefeſt fodder and will make the hard fleſh.
                  Likewiſe their ſtandarts and poſts to faſten thē by would

be made round and ſmooth, of the bignes of xvi. inches about and vii. foot long, and ſette iiii. foote wide one poſt from another. Ye muſt ſée likewiſe they be ſet faſt and ſtrong both aboue and beneath: and ye ſhall alſo hardle your oxen in the ſtawle, all of the one ſide of your ſtandartes or poſtes, for feare of their hornes the one oxe to hurt the other, and ye ſhall faſten them vnto the poſtes, with a bow-with made ſhacle wiſe, ſliding aboue and beneath his necke on the ſtandart, ſo that the one ſide of his necke ſhall be alwaies cloſe vnto the ſaid ſtandart or poſt. By which order of tying ſo, they ſhall not at any time bow their heads ſo well to licke them. For in licking them (as is ſaid) it doth hinder their feeding in the fatting. And alſo if ye ty them as plowe oxen be, with a ſole and a with, which is made like a yoake bow, which would be to long a tye from the ſtandart, and they will then both licke them ſelues, and ſtrike ech other with their hornes: therefore the other way of hardeling and tying is beſt. Some do make a light cradle of wood, and put it about their neckes, which wil keepe their heads from furning backe to licke themſelues in any part of their bodies, but it is not ſo eaſie to ly downe. Other do al to ſméere them with their owne dung, and then caſt aſhes thereon, which will ſaue them from licking. Alſo for the clenſing and farming of them, they do vſe morning and euening to ſhoouell downe their dung, and to ſee from time to time that they bee cleane kept, for that is a furtherance vnto their fatting and liking. And as for the littering of them, they doo not litter at all, but let them lye on fayre drye plankes, and in their owne dung. Yet ſome are of this opinion, that to litter them ſomewhat vnder the forepart of their bodies, ſhall not be hurtfull vnto them: and further their kéeper muſt from time to time look vnto them, and marke how they eate and drinke orderly as they ſhould doo. For ſometimes there will grow diſeaſes among thē in their mouths, as the barbes and ſuch like: Which will much hinder their féeding, and ſo paire if they be not looked vnto in time, and haue helpe.
                  
                     
Some do alſo vſe to make holes behind them, and ſet there in earthen pots euen with the ground, to kéepe their piſſe in, and ſo couers them with ſquare boordes or plankes, which piſſe they do vſe to waſh the bodies of thoſe apple trées which are geuen to be worme eaten, or canker eatē: for they ſay, that wil ſaue them. They do alſo vſe to caſt the ſaide piſſe among their rootes in the garden, for that will alſo kill or cauſe the wormes to voide, and ſaue the rootes from being eaten. Thus much for the ordering and fatting of the oxen in the ſtawle.
                  Ye ſhal take the rootes of great ſedge, which ſedge beareth long leaues with white ſtrekes therein, much like a white and gréene lace, and growes in ſome gardens, like a quitch graſſe, and the rootes are much like vnto the quitch graſſe, but they are more greater, and will run in the ground like the quitch calde garum, in latin, and it is thought to bee a kind thereof. Take a handfull of the ſaid rootes, bruſe them, and boile them in a quart of good ale, then ſtraine it, ſo giue it luke warme three or foure mornings, and they ſhal amēd. But let them not eate nor drinke the ſpace of two or thrée houres after.
               
               
                  The nature of the ſhroue mouſe.
                  THe ſhroue mouſe is an ill beaſt and doth trouble & hurte mens cattel in many places: for her téeth are venemous, for where as ſhe biteth any beaſt, it will ſoone ranckle and ſwel, that if they haue not ſome helpe they will dye thereof. The remedies are, thoſe medicines which are vſed againſt venoming of other cattell, be alſo good for this.
                  There is alſo a common ſaying among huſbandmen, that if any beaſt be mouſe crope, that is, when ſhe runneth ouer the backe of any beaſt, he ſhal ſodainly waxe lame, and commonly in the hinder partes, ſo that hee ſhall not bee able to riſe nor go, but draw his legges after him. Wherein I haue hard no remeady but theſe: one is, ye ſhall haue him to a bryer growing at both the endes, and draw that beaſt

vnder it through, and ſo he wil recouer: ſome beat him with the ſaid bryer. Alſo among huſbandmen this is counted moſt chiefe and often proued. That is, ye ſhall often toſſe and turne the lame beaſt, and turne him ouer and ouer: Now of one ſide and then of another, euery way vp and downe, which (as they ſaye) is a preſent helpe.
                  Another. Some do teach to bore a hole in anye tree, elme or other, and put therein a liue ſhroue mouſe, and pin it cloſe, and let it ſo drie therein. Then when any beaſt is mouſe crope, ye ſhall beat the beaſt with a twigge of the ſame tree, and he ſhall recouer againe. Another. If your beaſt be bitten with the ſaid mouſe, it wil ſwell and inflame, and then they do helpe it in pricking the place with a bodkin, or nawle of latin, and then all to chafe it thereon, with ſope and vinegar mixt together, and that will helpe it. Another. Sume do take a ſhroue meuſe aliue, and put her into a glaſſe of ſallet oyle, and therein let her dy, and when any beaſt is bitten with her, they annoint the bitten place with the ſayd oyle, and ſo he will amend, but touch no other place with the oyle.
               
               
                  To heale the tetter on cattell.
                  THe tetter is an vnſeemely ſcuruines or ſcabbe growing on the ſkinne or outward part of a beaſt. Some are broade, and ſome will growe long, and hang like a cluſter of grapes, or like a wenne with curnels, and knobs ſomewhat hard. It is ſuppoſed they do increaſe by wette and pouertie: and ſome thinke it doth increaſe of ſome venomed humour, or by ſome pricke or bruſe or ſuch like. It is not grieuous vnto the beaſt, but vnſeemely. The remedies are, they do helpe the running or broade Tetter, by ſearing it rounde about with a hote yron, and then to laye Tarre thereon. Some doo but laye Tarre onelye thereon: and for the long tetter, that hangeth

downe like a cluſter of grapes, or bunch: They do ſeare it of with a hot yron, and then do tarre it thereon, and ſo it goeth awaye. Alſo they ſay, when the beaſt doth waxe fat and luſty by graſſe, it will ſo weare away by little and little againe: for they haue it commonly in winter, and not in ſommer.
               
               
                  Another for the ſame.
                  YE ſhall mixe orpement with tarre, and put therto of gray ſope, al in like quantity, and do heat it, and then annoint therewith, ſo often as ye ſhall ſee cauſe, and this will heale it. If the tetters hang long, ſome do knit them about with haire, and by ſuch meanes they will ſo conſume and fall away.
               
               
                  Againſt faintnes in labouring oxen.
                  THoſe oxen that are laboured all the winter at plough, towarde the ſpring they will waxe faint and poore, and full of lice, and with ſmall labour they will lye downe. Therefore to keepe them ſtill in good plight, and luſtye, ye ſhall giue them before their watering, to euerye Oxe a good handful of barly in the ſtraw, and then after let them drink: which will alwaies kéepe them luſty and ſtrong. And alſo kembe your oxen with a horſe combe or carde, it wil delight them the more, being fat oxen. Yet ſome will ſay, a fatting oxe, muſt not be touched or rubbed on the backe.
               
               
                  For a cow lacking milke, hauing new calued.
                  WHen ye haue a cow that hath newely calued, and lacking milke through pouertie, to cauſe her milke to increaſe, yee ſhall boyle of anniſeſéedes in good ale, or

wine, then ſtraine it and giue it milke warme. Another: take a handful of the leaues of the hedge vine, (called Briony) then baile it in ale or wine and ſtraine it, and ſo giue it her.

                  An inſtruction for the ferrar and horſeleech.
                  
                  
                     THe duetie of Ferrars and Horſeleeches which deſire the knowledge to helpe ſoreneſſe and diſeaſes in horſes. They muſt well and perfectly vnderſtande of the preſent diſeaſe in the horſe before they miniſter. Alſo to looke on him well, howe manie other griefes are growing on him, and whether the cauſe be hotte or colde. To know alſo the operation of all ſuch herbes, and drugges, as he doeth miniſter vnto them. With what quantitie and portion of eche thing thereof, and in what time and houre of the dale and yeere is beſt. Alſo what force and ſtrength the horſe is of which he doth miniſter vnto. And whether he be olde or young, and which diſeaſe to cure firſt.
                  Theſe thinges well conſidered, ſo when yee haue miniſtred vnto the horſe, and giuen them drinkes in declaring howe they ſhoulde after bee kept. Hee ought alſo to looke well vnto them (after their drinkes) for a tyme: to ſee howe his medicines doth woorke, not to giue a horſe drinke (as moſt horſeleeches doe) and then to let them goe, and takes no care thereof after. Whereby manie horſes falles woorſe ſicke, and ſo periſheth ſoone after for lacke of attendance and good gouernement, which is a greate diſcredite to that ferrour, or horſeleech. For like as the wiſe learned Phiſition, when he haue miniſtred vnto his patient. He will not then vpon the ſodaine depart, but firſt hee will know the working of his medicine: and thereby hee getteth the more knowledge. Euen ſo the horſeleech ſhould after giuing drinkes, marke the woorking thereof in eche horſe. So likewiſe for his ſalues and playſters hee ſhoulde looke vnto them from time to time, and ſee

the working thereof, whereby ſo doyng, he ſhould increaſe ſtill more and more in knowledge and fame. Thus much for inſtruction to the ferrar and horſeleech.
               
               
                  The iudgement of Laurence Ruce of a beautiful horſe.
                  THe parts of a beautifull horſe are theſe, he ought to haue a ſmall leane head, with the ſkinne ioyning to the ſame, broade forhead, ſhorte eares and ſharpe, great eies not hollow, his noſtrils large and open, his lippes thinne and ſlender, a large mouth and cloſe, a long necke and ſlender towardes the head, his mane creſted ſomewhat bowing vp, & broade breſt, a ſhort back and ſtraight, his reynes full on both ſides with flankes like an Oxe, his hanches long ſtretchingout, a round rumpe, his taile with ſlender long haire, large thighs fleſhy withinſide as without, his legs ſtraight, leane and plaine, large hips, great legs, lean and ful of haire, the ioynts of his legs big, not fleſhie by the hoofes, rounde hoofes, ſhort paſtornes, ſtrong and well ſet, with the reſt of his vniuerſall members of his body in length as in breadth, his necke riſing greater towardes his ſhoulders and breſt, and to be higher behinde then before, like to the ſtagge or hart.
               
               
                  Alſo the nature of the horſe.
                  THe horſe is of a hot temperat nature, his heat is ſhewed by his highneſſe, he is holde and of long life, for he is of a longer life than all other labouring beaſtes, his tē
                     perature is therein found, for he is eaſie to be taught, and gentle towardes his maiſter and féeder. Thus much heere touching the beautie and nature of a horſe.
               
               
                  
                  To the Horſemaiſter and breeder of coltes.
                  
                  
                     1
                     RIde not thy horſe too young I ſay,
                     nor labour him too ſore:
                     Where griſtles is as yet but weake,
                     ſtriue not with him therefore.
                  
                  
                     2
                     A young horſe ſoone doth catch a cruſhe,
                     and wilfull oft they be:
                     Wherby their ſorowes doth increaſe,
                     as dailie yee may ſee.
                  
                  
                     3
                     Therefore to vſe and tame thy coltes,
                     from yeere to yeere take paine:
                     And when thou makeſt them ready ſale,
                     the more ſhalbe thy gaine.

                     Thy horſe once ſicke, deferre not time,
                     his griefe for to appeaſe:
                     For ſoreneſſe oft ſo dangerous be,
                     thou maiſt thy horſe ſoone leeſe.
                  
                  
                     5
                     If thou doeſt mark of ſorenes moſt,
                     whereof they doe proceede:
                     Thou ſhalt finde out that moſt doe come,
                     For lacke of taking heede.
                  
                  
                     6
                     Therefore let this booke be thy glaſſe,
                     wherein thou maiſt haue ſight:
                     How for to helpe and ſaue thy horſe,
                     wherein thou haſt delight.

                     no kinde of helpes to want:
                     Of ſecret knowledge in thy horſe,

                     A Prouerbe.
                     To truſt all currant horſecourſers,
                     I viſe thee to beware,
                     For truth among the moſt of them
                     is found to be full rare.
                  
               
               
                  
                  Breeding of coltes.
                  
                     ALl thoſe which hath a deſire for to bréede coltes & horſe, they muſt firſt make prouiſion for the good gouernement thereof, and to haue large paſtures, and to bee meaſured in their meate as well as other cattell. For a horſe doth aſke a greater diligence to be meated and kept in the ſtable more then other cattel. There is thrée ſortes of horſes, the firſt are to be nouriſhed young, which are noble and excellent: for the field and tourney. The ſecond is, for carriage of burdens, as moyles and packe horſe, which are bought and ſolde for that purpoſe according to their goodneſſe. The third is, another ſort of horſes and mares of eaſie prices, cō
                     mon for moſt men, the which is of a meaner and ſmaller ſtature, and for the common ſort are moſt neceſſarie to trauell with, and alſo are better to féede and bring vp for to till the earth, which muſt haue alſo kéepers continually to ſée vnto thē in fields & paſtures, aſwel as in woods or other grounds, and to kéepe them from daungerous places of myres and bogges, and where as they may haue ſoft graſſe and ſweet, as wel as to be ranke, high and great. They doe ſuffer theſe horſes to be with the mares in paſtures or other groundes, and paſſe not when they doe couer the mares, not for theſe ſort of horſes: but for your large & great mares, they ought to bee couered about Aprill or May, and ſome doe couer in mid March, to the end the mares may foale about the ſame time they were couered, in hauing ready the ſame time the tender graſſe and herbe to feede on, and to haue the hot and faire ſeaſon vnto harueſt: for about the end of xii. moneths after ſhe foaleth: and therfore ye muſt with good aduiſemēt, put the horſe vnto the mare. For he that kéepes theſe ſort of beaſtes, muſt ſerue them at the ſame houre, when they are deſirous, or when they doe enter into the fierce and hotte deſire of the horſe, which is (as Hippomanes ſaith) a venome) becauſe it inflameth both men and beaſtes, and to haue the like rage in loue as the horſes and mares. For

mares maie conceiue of themſelues, without the company of the horſe, as without doubt it is moſt true, that in ſome countries, the mares be ſo great heate, and deſireth ſo to be couered, that although they haue not the horſe, neuertheleſſe in thinking and deſiring ſo muche the horſe, they burne ſo within themſelues, that in thinking thereof, they become with foale. Like as the birdes of houſes, as Cockes to laie egges, and hennes to laye egges without the Cocke. And as the Poet Virgill in his thirde booke of Georgiques ſaith thus:
                  
                     
                        Aboue all all beaſts great loue there was,
                        in theſe hot ſort of mares,
                        As was oft times in Venus loue,
                        by fleſhlie mindfull cares.
                        When Glaucus puniſhed was,
                        for his audacitie,
                        By carrying of ſuch mares,
                        into the yle Pontie.
                        
                        Which loue did cauſe them range,
                        the mountaines of Gargare,
                        Alſo Aſcanie, and
                        the mountaines of Gargare.
                        Thorow ſprings and mightie riuers,
                        themſelues did oft torment,
                        By eating of the herbe in ſpring,
                        that heate did ſtil augment.
                        They turning on the mountains high,
                        all right againſt the winde,
                        Saith (my Author) Sephorus,
                        
                        in their hot burning minde.
                        They ſo became with foale,
                        without hauing the horſe,
                        Which fire to quench is maruellous,
                        that ſo will haue his courſe.
                        They running in all partes fiercely,
                        thorow ragged rockes and ſtones,
                        
                           
Ouer mountaines and low vallies,
                        with cries, ſighes and grones.
                        Except the Orient partes,
                        and in the North and Weſt:
                        Whereas the winde is boiſterous colde,
                        with ſhades oft times oppreſt.
                        Which beaſts with pearcing aire,
                        oft times are turnd and toſt:
                        Whereas ſmall heate of ſunne doth come,
                        are puniſht with the froſt.
                        Which cauſeth their hot nature
                        more milder for to be,
                        In countries cold alſo they are,
                        as yee maie dailie ſee.
                     
                  
                  Alſo it is moſt true in ye holy mountains of Spaine, which lieth towardes y• occident ſeas. Many genets & young mares Couering mares. haue colts, without the couering of the horſe, which coltes they do nouriſh & bring vp, and yet they are vnprofitable, for within 3 yéeres when they ſhould be at perfect grouth, they die. But as touching the couering of ye mares, ye méeteſt time is about the moneth of March or April, then let the young mares be ſatiſfied of their natural deſire, & the reſt of y• yéere to kéep the horſe frō them, & to ſeparat y• great ſtalions apart, it ſhalbe beſt, becauſe they ſhal not couer when they would: but to kéepe them to couer, when the beſt time is, and ſo it ſhalbe better, ſo that ye haue paſture for them, and let them be farre from the mares, or els to kéepe them ſtill in the ſtable, vntil the time of couering your mares, againſt which time they ought to be well nouriſhed, and fed with barley, & dried peaſe, to make them more luſtier. For whereas a horſe is weake in couering, ſo much weaker ſhal the colt be in growing and might. Some doe make the horſe therefore as luſtie as he maie be, whereby he may the better endure to couer many mares within a ſhort time, and yet not to couer aboue xv. or xx. mares, nor to beginne before hee is of thrée yeeres olde: for then he will better continue till twentie yeeres, and moſt commonly they are found good, if the

horſe be then ſtrong, and haue reſt. But if he be feeble and weake, ye muſt then rubbe the nature of the mare with a ſpounge, and put it into the horſe noſtrels, and if the mare will not ſuffer the horſe to couer her, yee ſhall bruſe the ſea onion, cald ſquilla, and with that all to rub the ſecrets of the mare, and that ſhall put her in more heat. And ſometimes they let an other horſe leape on the mare, to bring her in more heat, and takes him of againe by and by, and then put the other horſe vnto her and ſo he couers her. Now after ſhe haue taken and is with fole, ye muſt haue a great care for hurting of her, and not to labour her ſoone after her couering, Gouernment of the mare with fole. or when ſhe is nie foling. But to nouriſh her well ſpecially in both the ſaid times. If ye haue not graſſe in winter, ye muſt ſtable her, for ſhe féede twaine. Let her not runne, or trauaile ſore, nor ſuffer any great colde, nor yet to keepe her in any ſtraite or narrow place, or cloſe ſhutte vp, that one hurt not an others belly. For al theſe afore ſaid do oftentimes make them bring forth dead coltes. Alſo the ſnuffe of of a candle hold it at her noſe, will make her caſt her colt, or when ſhe longeth not to giue her deſire. Alſo if the mare fole in traueiling, or haue a dead colt, ye ſhall ſtampe polipodium rootes, or oke ferne, and mixe it with warme water, and giue it her with a horne. But if ſhe haue folde well and the colt faire, touch not the colt with your hands, for by touching it neuer ſo little (being yet but tender) ye may ſoone hurt it. Ye muſt alſo haue a care to ſée it laid warme, and to order the damme ſo as ſhe may haue ſpace inough about her, for the tender colt may ſoone be hurt by the dam if ſhe ſhould chaunce to lye on it. So by little and little ye may bring it abroad with the mare, and take heed that dung hurt not his hoofes: and when he is of more ſtrength, ye may then let him féed continually with the dam, becauſe ſhe ſhal not haue anger to ſée her colt, for commonly a mare will become ſicke for loue of her colt, if ſhe ſée it not. Good and luſty mares do bring coltes yearely, and the great and faire mares, ought not to haue coltes but from two yeare to two yeare, to the end (by long ſucking) the coltes may waxe and grow more

ſtronger, and thereby they will be the better to trauel, when any ſhalbe put to ſerue in the field.
                  Alſo the ſtallen muſt not be younger then thrée yeares when he couereth a mare, and ſo he may continue vnto xx. yeares well: and the ma
                        •
                     e may beare well at two yeares, ſo that when ſhe is of iii. yeares ſhe ſhall nouriſh well her colt, but after ſhe is x. yeres, ſhe is not ſo good. For commonly an olde mares colt wilbe heauie in labour, weake, and ſoone wearie. If ye will ſhe ſhall bring a male colt, or female, for the male, when the horſe doth couer her, ye muſt bind backe with a cord or plucke backe his left ſtone, and for the female Mares, for male & female bind backe the right ſtone of the horſe, and thus yee may do vnto all other kind of cattell.
                  After the colt is folde incontinent ye may iudge what hee wilbe: if he be wel fold, then tractable and ſure of foot, & mouing Tokens of a good colt. at the noiſe of any thing, full of play and ſwift, hauing a ſhort rumpe, more proper then other are of his age. If hee will leape out of a hole without reculing back. If he will by the way paſſe boldly ouer bridges and riuers. Alſo theſe are the ſignes in a good colt, hauing alſo the beautie & good diſpoſition of the body, as to haue a leane ſmall head, blacke eies, wide noſtrels, ſhort eares, and ſtraight, the chyne of his back large and ſoft, and not long, his mayne thick hanging on the right ſide, a large breaſt and open, with ſtrong muſcles and ſinewes, his ſhoulders large and right with round ſides, his backe bone euen, his belly gant, his ſtones and codde cloſe & ſmal, his raines large deſcending, his knées round & ſmal, not turning inward, his legs right and ſtraight, his buttocks round, his thighes thicke and ſtrong, his taile long with big crumpled haire, his hoofes hard and high ſmooth and round, & his fore top aboue very ſmal, & al his body big, hie, & ſtraight, and well in lifting his féet, faire to ſée in length, & round according to his body. Alſo to be pleaſant and ſoone chaft, & ſodaine gentle and méeke again, for theſe coltes of ſuch nature do ſoone obey the man, and wil patiently endure labor & traueile. If a colt when he is folde do not caſt his milt, huſbandmen ſay he will not liue long, but die ſodainly in few yeares

after, and ſome colt will caſt two miltes, no horſe that liues xii. yeares hath any milt within him. Alſo for the taming or breaking of a horſe colt when he is of two yeres he may wel be tamed and broken for the vſe of the houſe, but for the field or iourney, he muſt be of iii. yeres old. and then after iiii. hes may be taken to trauell, and looke alſo from time to time how the markes do change in his body. The age of a horſe is knowne by his hoofes, and taile, and barres in the ruffe of his mouth, but chiefely by his teeth, for a horſe of two yeres olde and halfe, wil caſt his two formoſt téeth aboue, and alſo vnder, and when he is iiii. yeres, the téeth which we call dogges téeth fall, and ſo cometh other: and before the ſixt yeare, the great téeth or chewing téeth aboue do fall, and on the ſaide yeare, the firſt téeth that fell, are returned whole againe, and on the ſeuenth yeare all are filde vppe againe without hauing any hollownes in the teeth, and from the ſeuenth a man may not wel know of his age, yet about x. yeres his tē
                     ples will begin to be hollow, crooked, and withered. therefore ſome do take vp the ſkin to hide the ſame, and being old, his browes will waxe long, and gray haired, and his téeth grow long and blacke. Alſo when as your horſes are in health, and yet waxe leane, ye ſhal fat them ſoone with dryde wheat or barly, but ye muſt giue this like a maſh in wine or ale, and by little and little to make them haue continuall appetite, mixe therewith the branne of barly, vntill ye ſhall accuſtome them to eate beanes, and pure barly.
                  Alſo ye muſt ech day, chafe his body as ye do to ſome men, Chafing his body. in rubbing them vp and downe with a cloth, and often ſo couered and rubbed, doth profit them much, and alſo to be lead and rubd with ones hand on the backe is better then to giue them much meat, for rubbing doth profit, preſerue, and kéep both ſtrength of body and legs, for fault of rubbing many ſoarnes growes on the legs of horſes in traueile, and this I will counſell you, if one lead his horſe in a raynye tyme from his labour into the ſtable, hee muſte ſee that the place bee drye, and that their hoofes bee not wette, or ſtande in colde wette places, for that both

will cauſe them being hot, to founder, or to haue an ague. If the ſtable be well planked with oke, or if the earth bee often clenſed, and laid cleane ſtraw thereon, for horſes oftimes being hot, they catch diſeaſes, in being wearie and ſtanding on the cold ground, ſpecially when they are not ſtrong, then ſée the more vnto them: for when they ſweat, to giue them meat or drinke, doth hurt them, but when they are cold ye maye then without danger giue them meat or drinke, but after Drinke or meat. his drinke, ſturre him a little, and he ſhall do the better, and then ye may giue him prouender or other meat: and when they haue reſted long they chafe them ſodainely which is not good, and for your wearie beaſtes ye muſt let them reſt, and put of ſallet oyle into their throates with a horne, or freſh greaſe with wine: and againſt cold, ye muſt giue them thinges to vomit, and frote their heads, and ridge bone with wine or ſtrong ale, or greaſe melted and warme rubbed thereon. If your horſe cannot piſſe, giue him oyle mixte with wine, and chafe him in the flankes, and on the raines. If that ſerue not, put or giue him garlicke with ale: alſo they ſay, to bruſe garlicke and rub his yard, is good againſt let of vrin. A péece made of hony and ſalte put into his yarde, or liue flies, or a little frankincenſe, or ſquirt the iuyce of betony into his yarde. Or giue him warme water, or waſh his yarde with warme vinegar. All theſe are good remedies when he cannot ſtale, or when his vrin burneth in the inner part of the bladder, or when he hath a hot water.
                  Alſo when a horſe hath paine in his head, ye may know it by dropping of his vrine, and in falling and flagging of his eares. His necke, and head, heauie hanging downward, and paine in the head. then ye muſt let him bloud on the vaine vnder the eie, and ſquirt into his noſtrels warme water, and that day giue him no meate, on the morrow faſting ye ſhall giue him warme water, and then ſome graſſe, and litter him well with olde haye, or ſoft ſtraw, at night againe giue him warme water, and ſome barly mixt with two pound of fetches, and ſo by little and little let him come to his ordinarie féeding, Alſo againſt paine of the eie teeth, or grinding teeth, ye ſhall fume

them with hot vinegar, and ſome do hold it to the téeth with a cloth on a ſtickes ende, and ſo rub them therewith. This is good alſo when there is any inflamation or ſwelling in them. Alſo if his ſhoulder be hurt, or that he haue loſt bloud, then ſhall ye open the vaine in the middle, betwixt his two fore legges, and rub his ſhoulder with the ſaid bloud, mixte with the fine powder of frankincenſe, but let not to much bloud for weakening him, and lay on the place his owne dung, and bind it faſt with ſome thing, and yee ſhall on the next day againe draw ſome more bloud in the ſame place, and vſe it as before, and then giue him no barly, but a little hay, and on the third day vnto the ſixt ye ſhall giue him in the morning vi. ounces of the iuice of leekes, mixt with a pound of ſallet oyle, and after the ſixt day then walke him a little, and lead him forth to ſome place to make him ſwim. Then do nouriſh him well after for a time, and hee ſhall doo well.
                  If your horſe is troubled with choller, his belly wil ſwell and wil be hot, nor he cannot then vent beneath, and then ye muſt rake him with your hand, and clenſe the naturall conduits which are ſtopt, and take forth his dung, and ye ſhall giue him ſauin, ſtaueſaker, and ſalt boild and mixt together, in putting to a little honie, and miniſter it in at his tuel like a gliſter or ſuppoſitorie: which will moue and purge forth al the choller. Some do beat iii. ownces of mirre, with iii. pintes of wine and giues it with a horne: and to chafe and rub his tuell with tarre and olde greaſe. Other do waſh his belly with falte water of the ſea, or water and ſalte. As for other purgations, they do commonly giue in powders, and pilles, which muſt be giuen with good diſcretion, according to ech diſeaſe, his medicine. Which ye ſhal vnderſtand more thereof at large, in M. Blundeuils booke for horſes, howe and when to purge them, therefore I here paſſe it ouer.
                  Againſt the bots or wormes in the guts, when the horſe is troubled therewith, the ſignes are: he will oft wallow and lye downe for paine, and riſe ſodainly againe. Alſo hee will bow his head towards his ſide or bellie, and ſtampe with his

feete, and friſke with his taile often, the next remedy is, put your hand into his tuell and drawe forth his dung, and waſh his belly with ſea water, or ſtrong ſalted water, and caſte in his throate three ownces of the rootes of capers beaten with halfe ſo much vinegar, and that will kill all wormes and bottes. Some take hot embers and put it in running water, then ſtrayne it and giue it warme with a horne, and walks him after halfe an houre, and tyes him vp with the bridle: and others take fenegreke, and baies, licoras, and turmericke, Drinkes for horſes. of ech a halfepeny worth, of anniſeſéeds a penyworth, with a quantitie of brimſtone in powder, & beat all theſe ſmal together, and put them in a quart of ale, and giue it faſting warme, and walke and vſe him as before, & kéepe him warme al that day after: or a pint of milke, with a ſponful of ſope. Some giue ſauin chopt among prouender, or a ry ſhelfe: or the fine powder of brimſtone in warme milke: ſome other do let them bloud faſting in the ruffe of his mouth, and that is the beſt for a mare that is with fole, and to let her Mare with ſole bloud often and to giue her a little prouender after, for if ye ſhould giue her ſtronger thinges, it were dangerous for the colt, except it were ſtrong, and nigh her time: & ſome do giue Cough. them mans dung hot, and annoints the bridle therewith, and chafes him thereon, and malueſy alſo is good faſting: for the cough newly taken, they take lentile peaſe, clean made, dride and beat to powder, and put thereof in warme water, and ſo giuen a pint, Uſe him thus thrée daies, and giue him graſſe, and tender branches of hearbes. For an old cough, they heale with vi. ounces of the iuice of léekes, mixt with a pound of oyle oliue, and ſo giue it with a horne, and giue him graſſe to eat after, and to annoint his griefe with vinegar & oyle mixt together. If it helpe not, then chafe him ſometimes with ſal niter & allum mixt together with a fether, of ech 
                        〈◊〉
                      like, with ſome vinegar. If there be puſhes or bliſters on his Puſhes and bliſters. body, ye ſhal frote them ſo hard in the ſunne that they bléed, they mixe of the roote of iuie with ſo much brimſtone, of tar and allum, put al together, and therewith heale it. For the cough ſome ſay, take a hedgehog, & caſt him into an ouen, &

dry him to powder, and alway mixe of that powder with his prouender, which wil helpe at length any cough. Or to take a handful of boxe leaues ſmal chopt, and mixe it with a peck of ground malt, and ſéeth it in a gallō or two of faire water, and let the horſe drinke thereof milke warme, and giue him white water for two or three daies after, or a handfull of groundſell, ſmall ſhred with the powder of licoras, and anniſeſéedes, of ech a quantity, and ſo giue it warme in a quart of ale: then ride him ſoftly after and keepe him warme for two or thrée daies after.
                  To heale al ſores or other chaſinges on horſes in any part All ſores chafes. of his body, they do vſe to waſh them with warme water, and then to rub and chafe them with greaſe, and ſalt melted together, ſo long till the matter ripe and iſſue out: ſuch ſores oftimes do kill horſes, if there be not (in the beginning) ſome remedy found. Some do annoynt them with oyle of Cedar, or of Lentyles, or with nettle ſéedes, mixt with ſallet oyle, or the oyle of a whale, or the dropping of ſalte tunny: and chiefely the greaſe of a ſeale fiſh. But if the ſores be old, ye muſt haue ſtronger thinges, as to boyle of betony hearbe, and brimſtone powder, of ellebory, of pitch, with as much old greaſe, and with this they do heale all old ſores, in racing them firſt with a ſharpe yron, and then to waſh them with piſſe, and ſo to annoint. And ſometime if it bee feſtred, to cutte it to the quicke, and then to drawe it with medicines, as ſhall be made with tarre and oyle, or ſuch like which will cleneſ and fill agayne the place, and when the haire ſhalbe full againe and cloſed full with haire, then it ſhall be good to chafe the place with ſoote of a cawdrone, and butter. and to heale a nauelgall, or ſore backe, take ſoote of a chimney, and yeſt mixt together, and plaiſter it therwith, which wil heale without any other thing, in ſhifting it once a daye. For riſing of the ſkinne or rayſing thereof. Take two great onyons, and boyle them in water, with hounds tongue hearb, then being hot, take a pound of ſalt, and mixe it with ſtrong vinegar, putting therein the yeolke of an egge,

then mixe all together, and rub the place therewith, and ye ſhall ſee the experience. And for his backe that is chopt and ſwolne, ye ſhall firſt waſh him with piſſe hot, then annoint him with freſh butter, and lay theron a little hay wet in cold water, and ſo clap your ſaddle thereon, and let him reſt ſo al that night, or annoint it with butter, then put on the wette hay, and your ſaddle. Some clap theſe to hot, horſe dung, & then the ſaddle, but take the groundes of ale or beere, and boyle it wel with mallowes, and clap it hot: but if the ſkinne be through chaft, ſo that it do water and is very moiſt, yee ſhall haue ready in a bagge filde with the powder of bryer leaues finely beaten, and put a little of that thereon, and it will drie it, by the morning, ond it will heale it alſo, without other thing. Alſo for ſore eies which may be heald with the meale of wilde tares, cald oreb. And the creuices and chops on the eies are healed, with faſting ſpettle, and a little ſalte, or the powder of a drie bone, and mixt with burnde ſalt, or the ſéedes of wilde parſnips in powder, and put in a cloth, and bloſh it in his eies: and all the griefes of the eies are healed by mixing the iuice of plantaine with honied water, or if ye haue not that, take hony, and time, mixt together. Alſo for a ſore eie, take ſtrong nettles, do ſtampe them and ſtraine them with beere, and ſquirt thereof into his eie twiſe or thriſe, then blow in a little powder of ſandiuer, and let him take no colde of his eie, till it be hole. If ye muſt needes ride him after, it were good to kéepe a cloth before his eie, to defend the wind, and it were good to let him bloud vnder the eie, and then dreſſe him once or twice, and it ſhall ſuffice: for bloud in eies take the white of au egge, and clap it to, or the iuice of Selandine to annoint, and it is good againſt anye ſtroke, and alſo it is good to make a toſt of bread and dippe it with white wine, and clap it to his eie, and vſe it often, or to let bloud vnder his browes: and to kéepe the flies from his eie, or other ſore, ye ſhal melt tarre and oyle, or tarre & hogs greaſe together, and ſtrike thereof all about.
                  Sometimes a horſe wil caſt bloud at his noſe, which doth weaken him much, and is gotten by ſome ſtraine, or ſuch

like, they ſtaunch it by blowing in at their noſtrels the iuice of Coriander, or bruſe the leaues of peruincle, and put thereof in his mouth, and let him chewe it in his teeth, and that will ſtanch bléeding of the noſe.
                  Sometimes a horſe will looſe his taſt, which cometh of ſorrow. The remedy is: Take iiii. ownces of the ſéeds of nigilromana, beat with vi. ounces of oyle oliue, mixt with a pint of wine, and make him to ſwallow it downe. The diſpoſitition of vomit: they vſe to take it awaye, in making them often to ſwallowe a beaten head of garlicke, with thrée parts of wine.
                  Againſt appoſtumed or peſtilent ſores, it ſhall bee good to pearce them with a hot yron, rather then with a colde, then plaiſter it with healing medicines. Peſtilence in mares.
                  
                  Alſo there is a peſtilence, which cauſeth mares ſodainely to waxe leane, and ſo pine awaye. If anye ſuch do happen, ye ſhall put in their noſtrels foure pintes of Fiſhe brine, called garume. If the griefe be great, they take ſixe times ſo much, and this will make them to purge and caſt out al flegme at their noſtrels.
                  Sometimes mares will be in a rage, but not often, which is to be noted, how that ſometimes they happen to be in a hot rage, that is: when they ſée their image in the water, they Mares in a rage. are ſodainely taken with loue, in ſo much that then they forget to drinke or eate, and in ſo burning doth become drie. The ſignes are, when ſhe runneth ouer the paſtures as ſhée were chaft or beaten, and looking oft about her, as though ſhe deſired ſomething.
                  They vſe to heale this folly, in leading her to the water againe. For when ſhe ſhall ſée her ſelfe in the water as ſhee did before, ſhee doth ſodainely forget her firſt image that ſhe ſawe: and this is often among mares. Thus will I here leaue a little of them, and ſpeake ſomewhat of moiles and their natures.
                  Who ſo hath a deſire to nouriſh aſſes and moyles, they ought diligently to ſearch for the fayreſt and beſt males,

and likewiſe the females to beare coltes, for if they bee not both well diſpoſed, thoſe which ſhall come of them ſhall nothing preuaile. Ye muſt therefore chuſe the mare vnder tenne yeares, and to be large and faire, and well membred, to abide trauaile: and let her beare eaſie burthens for hurting the ſéede within her belly, and not to be one
                        ••
                     e beautiful of body, but good alſo of ſpirite and ſtomach, and when the ſéede is long or it take life within her body, or being long ere ſhe fole, ſcarſly about the ende of xiii. moneths, is a token of ſome let. Notwithſtanding the moile colt taketh moſt after the aſſe that begat him, rather then after the life and nature of his dam, and yet ye ſhal not find it true in all mares, no more then is properly in all horſes. For ſometimes experience doth deceiue a mans iudgment in him which hee chuſeth. For oftentimes ſtallions of their owne nature and race, are marueilous in condition and forme. And whereas the mares are but ſmall and faire, commonly they bring more males then females. Neuertheleſſe the coltes do increaſe or diminiſh after or according to their dammes. Some ſtallions are ill to ſée to, and yet ſhall be great coltes of great price. And ſome do yéeld a worthines vnto the fruit, more then other ſome. But they are more colder and not ſo hotte of deſire, and are not ioyned in loue but verye hardly with the mare. And theſe ſort of ſtallions muſt haue mares of the like nature: For the like nature is more familiar to conceiue then others. Yet the aſſe neuer begets an aſſe, nor the moyle neuer begets moyles: and for this cauſe they do often ſuffer the ſtallions to mount on the mares, to put them in more heat, and to take them ſodainely away againe: Which ſhall make the horſe to be more eager of the mare, which before he little paſt of, and this is to be noted by the way, thoſe which haue their kidneys hotte, are alwayes more deſirous, then thoſe which haue their ſtones and kidneys colde, which is as well in man, as in beaſtes.
                  There is another ſorte of ſtallions which are in a rage

in their fierie heate, which are ſo diueliſh and frowarde, that thereby they are ſoone marde, if they be not wiſely gouerned and handied. And often they breake their haltērs and cordes in gnawing and eating them a ſonder, and leapes on mares with fole, in byting them by the necke and backe.
                  Now to correct ſuch, ye muſt put them into a horſe myll, and there to make him ſure, and vſe him a little to labour Hot ſtallion

                      gently, and ſo ye ſhall make him to leaue his furiouſnes. So when he hath left it, yet thereuppon let him not bee ſuffered to couer vntill hee bée in ſufficient heat thereunto. For this is of greater importaunce, that the ſprite of theſe beaſtes are naturally heauie and ſléepie. But by moderate exerciſes they will be the more liuelyer to trauaile, and then ye may let them couer, that by the ſecret efficacie of hidden nature, their fruit maye bee the more pleaſenter. Alſo a moyle doth not ingender with a ſhe aſſe, or mare, but a ſhe aſſe with a horſe, or a wilde he aſſe with a mare. Certaine authoures which I will not hide, as Marcus Verro, and before him Democritus, and Mago, haue ſayde, that in Africke there is no maruaile, or yet a monſtrous thing to ſée their moyles to beare, no more then the mares in this countrie. The moſte fayre and largeſt cattell among all moyles, are thoſe which are begotte of aſſes, and maye well be compared vnto thoſe which are gotten of wilde aſſes. If it were not that they are ſo troubleſome, wild, and hard to gouerne and rule, like vnto their ſires, there were none like them.
                  Wherefore thoſe ſtallions that ſhall come of that race, ſhall be better, and ſo from time to time alter. For if yee rouer a mare with a horſe that was begotte of a wilde aſſe, or tame, he ſhall kéepe their bigneſſe and modeſtye like their ſier, with like ſtrength and age vnto theyr firſt race. And thoſe which are gotten betwixt a horſe and an aſſe, ſhall beare the name of theyr parentes, as to ſaye horſe moyles: For they will reſemble lyke vnto theyr dammes. Therefore if it better to haue moyles

of an aſſe ſtallion, which by experiences come of a good and fayrer race, then otherwiſe. Hee muſt bee choſen great of Beauty of moyles. body, with a ſtrong neck, his ſides long & large, with an open and a large breaſt, and ful of ſinewes, his thighes fleſhye, his legs well truſt and blacke of colour or ſpotted. The aſſes are commonly of a mouſe dun coloured haire. But that is not a pleaſant haire for a moyle: Therefore in generall it is good to take good heede thereof, that ye be not deceiued by your eye, for euen like as we ſhall ſée the fleece of a Lambe, which cometh of a ram with a ſpotted tongue, ſo likewiſe, the aſſe hath haire of diuers colours on his browes and eares, and thereby often they make the moyles of diuers colours: Therefore when ye haue diligently conſidered of your ſtallion, yet neuertheleſſe ye may be deceiued, for beſide theſe foreſaid markes, ſometimes they haue moyles by other coloured horſes which they know not, and yet the ſame maie be as well eſteemed as other, which comes of no other cauſe but from their firſt parentes, and generation, which by mixing with others hath bene almoſt deſtroyed, and yet by the ſéede of the horſe is renued againe to his firſt eſtate. And the aſſe which I do write of, as ſoone as ſhee hath foled, it ought to bee taken away from her, and priuily to bee ſet to the mare which hath a colte, ſo that ſhe know not thereof, which muſt be done in the night, and ſet in a darke place. But firſt take awaie the mares colte, and put to the other, but in ten daies ſhe wil not let it ſucke, therefore ye muſte helpe it in the meane time, the one as well as the other, as yee ſhall cauſe. Or elſe take the vrine, or milke of the one, and rubbe the coltes therewith contrarie, and at length they will loue and vſe them for their owne. And this young ſtallion colt ſo nouriſhed of the mare, ſhal take a loue vnto mares herafter. And though oft times they be noriſhed with their Dammes milke, yet being but young, and hauing the vſuall company among mares daily, hee will thereby the better loue them, and ſo will he ſerue well your mares, but let him not couer them before hee bee three yeares Couering of young mares. olde. And at ſuch conuenient times, as graſſe may feede

him well, and ſometimes with ſheues of barly, ſometimes of good maſhes to drink of branne and wheat: or of wheat ſed, or barly ſodde, and let him not firſt couer a young tender mare, which hath neuer bene couered before. For in the mounting on her, ſhe will often ſtrike him with her feete, and thereby he will take it ſcornefully, which ſhall make him to caſt a continuall hate to all other hereafter, and therfore they put ſome other vnto the young mare to put her in a heat, and not to couer her, but with him. And when yée Place to couer ſhall ſee her deſirous to ſtande, then take him awaye, and put to the young ſtallion and let him couer her. Alſo it ſhall be good to haue a place made with boordes deſcending downewarde before, that ſhee maye the better take the horſe, and not flye aſide, or turne from the horſe when hee couereth her. Some doo manacle her fore feete to the hinder on both ſides. And by this deſcending place, a lowe aſſe, or horſe maye couer her the better, and more eaſier. And after being thus couered with an Aſſe, or other Horſe, then in the yeare after that ſhee haue folde, yee ſhall not by and by couer her againe with another, but in that yeare let her nouriſh her fole, which fole ſhall be the better hereafter to doo anye purpoſe: therefore let her not be couered againe ſo ſoone. And when that colte is a yeare olde, take him from his damme, and put the mare in ſuch paſtures as you ſhall ſeeme good, in woods or in mountaines, to harden her hoofes, whereby ſhee maye the better trauaile hereafter. And alwaies he moyles are better to beare the packſaddle, then then the ſhee moyles, yet ſhee moyles are more quicker, and nimble, and moſt méete to bring coltes: But they are both good to trauaile with the burthen, and alſo to labour the earth, if it were not that theſe kinde of cattell are ſomewhat to hygh for that purpoſe. Therefore commonlye they vſe a temme of Oxen to breake the groundes before.
                  And for the burthen ſome do ſaye a mare is weaker then a gelded horſe, & a gelding weaker then a ſtoned horſe, and a horſe weaket then a moile. For the moiles commonly (as

they ſay) wil carry v. or vi. hundreth weight, and therewith they will trauaile thirtie miles a day. For both horſe and moiles are beaſts of a great ſtrength, if they had vnderſtanding no man ſhould be able to rule them, and alſo they ſaye a horſe or moyle hath no braines, but in the place thereof, he Horſe without braines. hath as it were a bladder filde with winde, and no braines therin, or other thing, but like a white water. Thus I leaue of horſe and moiles, and here I will ſpeake of the ordering of horſe in trauaile.
               
               
                  How the husband or carter ſhould order his horſe in trauaile by the way, or other wiſe.
                  TO ſhew ſomewhat the duetie of carters, which carters muſt haue alwaies patience, in moderate vſing of their horſes, & at al other times he ought to beare a loue alwaies to his cattell, ſo that his cattell may loue him, not fearing them to much, let him neuer vſe to beat them with the ſtock of the whip, but to whip them with the laſh, and vſe them to the ſound therof, and yet not often for dulling of them: in trauaile vſe them ſometimes with fierce words more then with ſtripes. Your loytering horſes touch before the other, and the frée horſe touch him leaſt of all, but at a great néede. Alſo a frée horſe ought to be haltered ſhort, or els hee will ſoone ſpoile him ſelfe in ſtrayning continually, he will ſoone bée lame, broken winded, or blind. And vſe all the other at times when you ſhall ſee cauſe, and let them not in trauaile by the way, draw or labour ſo much as they may, touch not a horſe with the whip ouer his backe, for feare of his eies, and alſo he that is behind him, but touch on the legs of the néere ſide, and ſo ye ſhall auoide danger thereof, nor to draw to much for thereby ye may ſoone dull and tyer them, ſpecially in a young horſe, and after traueile truſſe them vp to the tuell, for taking cold. Ye muſt alſo euery morning vſe to rub and to kembe them, for therein a horſe doth delight, and it will make them more luſtier, and freſher to labor, and in

ſommer the like if they be howſed, or if they be at graſſe alſo: and water them not, but at their accuſtomed houres, and after as they haue iourneied in ſommer, waſh often their féete with cold water, and if ye can, ſometimes with wine, or ale and butter, which will ſupple and ſtrengthen their ſinewes, or to bath them with the lies of wine, which will likewiſe ſupple and ſtrengthen them, and after to rub their legs with butter or neruoileor nets foot oile, and if they be ſhod, ye ſhal bind to their hoofes dung mixt with mens vrin, and if their féet be hotte, or haue the goute, yee ſhall then waſh their mouthes with vinegar and ſalt mixt together, and for that time giue them no hay nor other forage as ſtraw or otes, nor Hot feet or hoofe. yet of litter, but wel clenſed, nor let them be ſhod til they be wel. Alſo the carter muſt vſe dayly to ſée that his harnaiſe be iuſt and méet for euery horſe according to his ſtature, that he may therein labour the eaſier. And alſo thoſe harnaiſes may be well looked vnto from time to time, and all things belonging thereunto: as halters, brydles, headſtalles, collers, hawmes, traces, pipes, wanties, packſaddels, backwanties, & belly wanties, with tack, or ſhoottle pin, tied to euery hawm The horſe cart and harnaiſe to ſee to. with a ſtring, to be the readyer at néed, and each of the belly wanties to haue a croſſe pinne, or ferrell of wood, to be alway ready to faſten and looſe, and to haue all thinges whole and ſound, not to be broken or faulty againſt any time of occupying, and to be wel hanged vpon hookes cleane from the ground, that horſes tread not thereon, or that dogs gnaw no part thereof, and euery horſe harneſſe placed by him ſelfe, ready to harnaiſe at all times. Alſo the carter ought to haue ſkill how to mend his harnaiſe, to ſtitch and ſowe it when any part or parcell thereof decayeth, and to haue his packſaddle, thréed and whitlether alwaies readie, or other great thréed wherewith to prepare to helpe the ſame againe, and to haue alwaies with him his nawle, and pannell néedle. The carter ought alſo to haue knowlege in ſhooing his horſe, that when any ſhooe fall looſe by the way in trauaile, he ought to haue hammer and nailes ready to faſten it on agayne, for looſing, or to ſet on ſome other, he ought to haue alwaies

ſhooes and nailes with him, for by that meanes he may ſaue his horſe oftimes from danger of ſurbat, graueling, or prickking with ſome naile, or cut with ſome ſtone, & ſuch like: for to haue experience in ſhooing is a thing ſoone learnd, there is ſmall danger, but in pricking or clowing with a naile, or to driue it nie or in the quicke, whereupon among all ſkilfull ſmithes, this prouerb is ſaid, which is, before behind, and behind before: which meaning is, the moſt dangerous nailes to driue in the fore féet, is the two hindermoſt nailes, and in the Prouerbe. hindermoſt féet, the two formoſt nailes, the reſt not ſo dangerous ſo that ye driue them euen. If your ſhooes bee made hollow or riſing in the midſt, and not flat to the foote, it will be much better for the horſe, to clenſe and voide graueling. For otherwiſe thou canſt not clenſe them ſo well, and they will the ſooner be graueled: therefore ſee to haue ſhooes alwaies ready againſt any ſuch time of néed.
                  Likewiſe alſo when thou doſt take any iourney, with the Preparing the cart. horſe and cart, thou muſt likewiſe ſée that all thinges belonging to the cart to bee ſubſtantiall and ſtrong, as thy whéeles, and carthodie ſtrong and ſure to beare a burthen, and the axeltrée likewiſe. Alſo ſée the rath ſtaues and ſtruts be whole and ſound and wel furniſhed, with ſtaues of good ſtrong holly, haſell, or aſh, and to haue them redy dride, if any want or breake, and all the ſhamble ſtaues to bée made of good drie and tough aſhe, which are to beare a burthen from the thyller, and thy cartladder, to be made of good drye aſhe alſo, and ſurely ſet thereunto. And let your axeltres be ſo made that they maye fill cloſe the nathes of the whéeles, for when they gaggle or ſhake, they go vneaſie, and hinder nigh the draught of a horſe, and that alſo is vneaſye for the thyll Horſe. And ſée that your axeltrée he well clouted and nayld cloſe thereon, that the nayles teare not the nathes of the whéeles. And ſee alſo in like manner the areltree pynnes be ſure and ſtrong, for if the axeltree goe not cloſe, they are commonlye in daunger of bowing or breaking: and let your nathes and axeltree he well greaſt, with freſh greaſe and ſope, or ſnayles mixt

together, for that will kéepe the nathes long coole, and to goe more eaſier. Which greace ye muſt alwayes haue with you when ye trauel by the waie, to occupie when yee ſhall ſee cauſe, and alſo to haue readie roapes endes, or other ſmal corde, that when anie thing doe breake or cleaue aſunder: by and by to mend and péece it againe. Thus aduiſedly traueling on thy waie, haue an eie to the fore horſe, in lanes ſpecially & ſtreetes for feare of children and beaſts, but if thou ſtaie, let thy horſe ſtaie alſo, take héede of the forehorſe in theſe places. Look wel to the body horſe, and in routs, holes, and dangerous waies be alwaies nigh vnto the thiller, with thy hand nigh his head: wherby thou maieſt the better rule him vppon a ſodaine, and alwaie looke to the going of the whéeles in thus doing. Thou ſhalt kéepe thy cart alwayes vpright from ouerthrowing, and when thou goeſt downe a hill, dragge the cart behinde, and vp a hill, weigh the cart before. And thus doing in conſidering all waies and places, poſtes, and gates, thou ſhalt auoyde oft times the dangers therof, which otherwiſe thou maiſt happen often therwith to be troubled.
                  Alſo the carter ought to ſee well to his horſe in trauelling, for the horſe is a beaſt of ſtoute courage, and he loueth Belles on the horſe. man, & he is delighted wt the whiſtle, drum, or in bels, which belles doe not hang ſo well at the horſe eare, as at his patrell, or on the backe wantie, for the belles hanging ſo nigh his eares, he cannot ſo ſoone heare his driuer, and the Carter muſt likewiſe be carefull at all times to ſée vnto his horſe, y• if any doe halt or complaine by any meanes, to ſee by and by vnto him, and ſearch where the paine reſteth, and to remedie it in time, with ſuch thinges as hee ſhal thinke good. Somtime to lay on their own doung on their paſtorns as afore is mentioned, he muſt alſo be wel aduiſed whē the hoof is newly hurt, & chafed, to make him haue a ſound hoofe againe, and in taking colde (after his labour) or when hee hath the cough, then ye muſt couer and kéepe him warme, and giue him maſhes, or if he be more founded by trauel in rainy weather, or at other like times, yee ſhall clappe the

rootes of Alexander ſodde in wine vnto his féete, and make him to eate Fenegreke, or Anniſeeds amōg his prouender. But if then he be of ful age, it were then beſt to change him: the carter muſt alſo vnderſtande what loue one horſe beareth to another. (For ſome wil not agrée together,) & according therevnto place them in the ſtable. The which ſtable ought to be made cleane euery morning, for a horſe loues to be cleane kept, and at night to be refreſhed with ſome clean litter, and the horſekeeper ought to ſleepe in the ſtable: to be ready if any horſe break looſe in the night and fight with his fellow. The keeper ought alſo to looke aduiſedly & warily vnto his candle, and to place it in the ſtable out of al danger, and nightly to hang vp his harneſſe for feare of dogges, or rattes, or other dangers of hurting with horſe, and to place them as afore is mentioned, and to haue them ready againſt the morning when he ſhould goe forth to labour them: that he ſlack not the time in ſeeking his harneſſe in partes. And when any horſe is ſicke or ſeeme heauie, then to forbeare, & not labour him for that time, for feare leaſt he waxe worſe. For in ſickneſſe a horſe is a very tender beaſt and heauye to any labour, therfore whenſoeuer ye haue laboured thē, walk them after for taking cold til they be in good temper, then truſſe them with ſtraw (as aforeſayd) for taking colde. For thereby breeds many diſeaſes in a horſe, which diſeaſes or remedies ſhal here follow.
                  Here I wil returne & ſpeake ſomwhat of remedies againſt ſoreneſſe as comes oft times to horſes. For a moyle or horſe Feuer. that hath the feuer, ye ſhall giue him to drinke rue or Coleworts, but when he draweth his breath ſhort, and doth often ſigh withall, then they vſe to let him blood on the necke vayne, and then take a pynt of wine with halfe an ounce of ſallet oyle, & mixe therewith ſome Frankincenſe, and with a thirde part of, the iuyce of mugwoort giue it, and if they haue any frets or galles on the paſtornes, ye ſhall playſter Paſtornes freted. thereon the paſte of Barley meale, and open the impoſtume if there be any, and heale it with tentes of lynt, and ſuche oyntments as afore is mentioned, with a pynt and a half of

                     Garum, which I take to be ſaltfiſhe water with a pound of oile oliue mixed together, and put it into his left noſtril, and put there vnto the whites of three or foure egges. And ſomtimes they doe launce their eies, and ſometime ſeare it with a hotte yron, and if the blood be deſcended downe into the feete. They cutte it, as the founder of a horſe, & they giue him bearefoote hearbe to eate, & Hyoſciame, called henbane, the ſeede is good alſo to be bruiſed and giuen with wine. Againſt the leanneſſe in a horſe, giue him often drinkes mixed with halfe an ounce of brimſtone finely beaten, with Leanneſſe in a horſe. a rawe egge, and a peny weight of the powder of mirre, mixe al with wine and giue it with a horne. Which is alſo good againſt pains of the belly, and for the cough: alſo againſt leanneſſe there is nothing better or ſo good, as thrée leaued graſſe giuen, betwixt gréene and dry, which doth alſo mightily fat him more than other hay, and yee ſhal giue of this but little at once. For it wil encreaſe too muche blood in the horſe, and thereby he maie ſonne take hurt. Alſo when a moyle or horſe is wearie and ſore chafed, ye ſhal caſt a péece of greace into his mouth and make him to ſwallow it, and Weary and chafed. giue him ſoma wine or ale therewith. The reſt for the horſe or moyle, ye ſhal vſe as afore is written, of medicines for Oxen and mares.
                  The hoof bound or matelong is when a horſe is pinched or Hoofe bond, or mate long. bound in the vpper part of the hoofe, it wil make the ſkinne to ſtare aboue the hoofe, and to grow ouer the ſame, It will payne the hoofe ſo that he cannot well ſuffer to treade full on the grounde, and wilbe hotte, it commeth by ſtanding drie in the ſtable, and by ſtraight ſhoing, or heat. The remedy is, ye ſhal race the hoofe aboue from the top to the ſole in foure or fiue places, ſo that the water may come forth. Some doe raſe it round in the top an ynch long downward, with the point of a ſhape knife, and then rubs it al well with ſalt once or twiſe and he ſhal do wel. If your horſe chance to be ſtifled as ye may ſo do in at a doore, or on the hie way in slipping Stiffeling 
                           〈◊〉
                         horſe. his hinder foot, or with a blow, he muſt be helped ſeene after: for if he tarry a day or more, ye muſt then rowle him.

If the ſtiffle bone be out ye ſhall féele and ſee it ſticke out, then put it in, and bathe him with beere, and binde his other ſhamme with a girth as hard as ye can all one night, then ſhift it in the morning, then rubbe and chafe the place, and binde it againe. Uſe him thus thrée or foure daies, and lette him ſtand on the ſore legge, & this is good alſo for any ſprain in that place.
                  If your horſe be ſprainde of ſome ſinew, yee ſhall then waſhe him with the groundes of ale or beere made warme, Sprainde. and therewithal to bathe him, in ſtriking it downwarde, then binde him rounde with a hay rope ſodde therein, and binde him from the fetterlocke vp to the hamme, and let it reſt all one night thereon. If once doe not helpe, vſe it oftener, or take of ſmallach, Oxeye herbe, fluellin, and ſome ſheepes ſuet, choppe and bruiſe altogether, and boyle it in mens vrine, and all to bathe his legge therewith, then take a haye rope ſodde or dipped therein & wrap his legge al ouer therewith and he ſhall doe well.
                  For a ſtiffle in the heele of a horſe, yee ſhall take but Stiffle in the heele. oatmeale and ſalt, of eche like quantitie, and temper it with a little running water, and make it into paſt in a ball, and then caſt it into a hotte burning fire, and let it lie til it bee redde hotte, then take it foorth and let it coole, and then beate it to fine powder, and put thereof on the heele, in crouſhing it downe to the bottome of the greefe. with a linnen cloth tyed on a ſticks end, and ſo dreſſe him twiſe a day, and before your dreſſing, waſh it with the groundes of ſtale vrine made warme.
                  If your horſe haue a farcie or faſhion, is an yll diſeaſe to cure, but if it be taken in time it may well be cured. It Farcie or Faſhion. will runne by vaines thorowe the body, and appeare in many places of the body, like knottes or bunches, as bigge as halfe a Wallnutſhell, and by following a vaine at length, it wil breake it ſelfe, and runne filthie matter, and as many horſes as doe touch or gnaw of him, within moneth ſhall haue the ſame diſeaſe: or if he doe bite anie other he wil infect him, and if they be not ſoone holpen, they will die thereof,

If anie horſe haue it, auoyd him at the firſt, if he can: for dangering all the other. This ſoreneſſe commonly comes of a corrupt bloud and humour ingendred in the bodie, and ſometimes it comes of bruiſed bloud by ſome ſtroke, or of ſome galling or byting with ſome other horſe, or of tickes, or hogge lice (as ſome doe ſay.) The cure, let him blood on the vayne nigh to the ſore, then burne euery bunch in plucking them vp with your hand to burne them the better, and leaue none vnburned. Then annoynt them euery day with melted hogges greace, till they fall away, then haue readie a pottle of olde ſtale, and boyle it a little with ſome coperas and ſalt, and a handfull of ſtrong nettles, and therewith warme, waſhe all the corrupt ſores, then fill eche hole with the powder of flacked lime, doe thus once a day til ye hoales are cloſed vp. If anie doe ranckle more than others, fil thoſe with verdegreace. In all this time let him haue a ſmall diet of meate, as ſtraw and water, or ſometimes a loafe of bread, for the lower, he is kept the ſooner he is whole, and yoke his necke that he licke not his ſores, alſo the leſſe reſt hee hath, the better for him. Another remedie, take of miſtleto, and ſtale piſſe, hony, blacke ſoape, ſeeth theſe altogether, & once a day warme, waſh your horſe all ouer therewith. Uſe this fine or ſixe dayes and yee ſhall ſee experience. Another: let him bloud in the necke foure fingers from the head, and alſo on both the ſides, and giue him this drinke. Take a gallon of fayre water, and put therein a good handefull of rewe, and a ſpooneful of hempeſeed, and bruiſe them in a morter altogether, and ſéeth it til the halfe be conſumed, and when it is cold, giue it him to drinke, and this wil make him whole. Another, a very perfect medicine, ye ſhall cut him two ynche long downe in the forehead, and open it in the mids thereof on both ſides two ynches, and put therein a tampin made of the inner rynde of Elder barke, and looke it lye croſſe the cutte, for ſo it will deſtroye all the venomed humor in his bodie, and it will heale him ſafe and ſound.
                  For a horſe that cannot ſtale, giue him a pint of wine

or ale mixed with garlick, & the whites of ten egs, & if ye cā, for a while giue him nothing but gréene graſſe. Another: Horſe cannot ſtale. giue him the iuice of red colewortes, mixt with white wine, or the roote of Alexander, bruiſed and ſodde in wine or ale and giuen, or to giue him warm water, or to waſh his yard with warme Uinegar. Alſo wormewood, or ſouthernwood, or galingale, or mallowes, or pimpernel, ſome of theſe, or anie one of theſe ſtampt with ale, and giuen, wil cauſe him to make water. For the haw in the eie comes oft times of a humor, or it may bréede of ſome ſtripe, A ſinguler remedy is: to make a plaiſter of the iuice of ground Iuie, ſtampt in a morter Haw in the eie. wt the iuyce of Iuie berries, or of the leaues beate with cold water, but better with wine, and plaiſterwiſe lay it to, & remoue it euening and morning. Alſo ſome do ſtitch y• eye lids in ye mids wt a néedle & double thréed, & taies one down, and the other vp, and then with another néedle puts out the haw, ſo far as ye may ſtaie it on your fingers end: and ſo cut awaie al ye hard matter a penie bredth, but cut not away too much of the waſh or fat, and leaue alſo the black behind, for by cutting away too much fat, yee ſhall make thereby the horſe bleare eied, and when it is cut away, ſquirt either beere or wine into the eie, or blow a little ſandiuer into his eie within a daie or two after, or Camamile mixt with a litle honie, and plaiſtred on.
                  The Uiues is an il ſorenes to heale, if they bee ſuffered to The viues in horſes. come vp vnder ye eares, which is a ſmal difference frō an impoſtume, they do come by taking cold whē he is hot vnwalked. Alſo they come of a corrupt humor, & are like kirnels, & wil make his throat ſore, & ſtop his wind, they do ripe them by laying to hot hogs greace, and ſo cuts them out. Some cuts a ſlit on both ſide, and with a toole of yron breaketh the neſt of them, and plucketh out parte and puts in the hole of nettles and ſalt, others laie riping things thervnto, as ſome barley meale, mixt with thrée ounces of raiſons ſod well together in ſtrong wine, then plaiſter it thervnto, and change it not til it be ripe, thē launce and ſo tent it with tēts which muſt be ſteeped in water, and mixt with ſallet oile and ſalt,

and ſome doe burne them downward with a hot yron in the mids from the eare to the iaw bone, & draweth two ſtrokes vnder the throat, and then launce it in the mids, and plucks out the kernels with a paire of 
                        〈…〉
                     ppers, ſo far as he may cut them off, without touching any vaine, and then fils the hole with ſalt, and if they be ranke, take a croppe or two of nettles beaten with ſome bay ſalt, and put therein two ſpoonful of ale or vinegar, thē ſtrain it, and put in either eare a ſpoonful thereof, and put ſome blacke wool after, and bind it faſt, & he ſhal do wel. The Squinācy is an yl ſoreneſſe, & is a ſorenes in ye throat of the horſe, and troubles him to ſwallow any thing, & cōmeth of ſome colde humor, which wil make his Quincie, tōgue & throat to ſwel. The cure: ye ſhal firſt fume & waſhe his mouth with hot water, and then annoint it with the gal of a bull, then take two pound of ſallet oyle, with a portion of old wine, put thereto nine fat figs, and ix. léeke heads, beat altogether and let it boile awhile, and before ye take it from the fire, in the ende put a litle of the powder of niter, finely beaten therin: or as ye ſhal ſeeme good. Then ſtrain all out, and giue it the horſe halfe a pinte thereof euening and morning warme, and let him eate of barley or gréene fetches, either barley meale mixt with niter, but in neceſſity ye maie let him bloud in the pallet of his mouth.

                  The King bone, is alſo an ill ſoreneſſe, it will appeare aboue the fore part of the hoofes, and ſome will be round aboue the ioynt, the haire will ſtare, and riſe on a bunch, and there will reſort a thicke and a ſlimy matter, it cometh by ſome blow of ſome other horſe treading, or by ſtriking one legge againſt another, in proces of time it will become hard like vnto a bone, and it will make him to trippe and halte, and yee ſhall ſée it higher then the hoofe, if it grow in any other part of the legges, then it is calde a knobbe, and no ringbone. The cure: waſh it well with warme water, and ſhaue that place the haire cleane of, and race it with a ſharpe razor and make it to bléede. Then take an ounce of euphorbyum, halfe an ounce of cantaradice, and beat them in fine powder, and take oile of baies an ounce. If the griefe bee but ſmally growne, take the halfe of each, and boile them all together, in ſturring it well. And with a fether laie it boyling hote on on the ſore, and ſtir him not for halfe an houre, then let him be in the ſtable, and vſe him thus nine daies in ordering him as ye doo for the ſplint. Then when the haire begin to grow again, ye ſhal fier it in down ſtrokes with a hot yrō in iii. or iiii. places like lines, til the ſkin looke yellow, frō the paſturn to the hoofe, and then laye molten pitch, and rozen, on flockes of his colour, and ſo clap it to, and let it ſo remaine till it fall of it ſelfe away. Alſo ſome do ſay the ringbone cometh of a bloud in a young horſe, which they helpe thus. They knit faſt a ſhoo makers threed aboue his knées, and let it ſo remaine for a ſpace, and that will ſtay the courſe of the bloud, if it come of bloud, but this muſt be done at firſt before it grow on the horſe foot. Of the foundring of a horſe, there is a foundring in the bodie, by eating ſodainly to much prouender afore he is colde, after his trauaile, which for lacke of digeſtion do bréede ill humours, and taketh awaye his ſtrength, and thereon he will be ſo féeble, ſcant able to ſturre his iointes, or being downe, not able to riſe, ſo troubled with paine not able to ſtale.

There is a foundring for a horſe to ſtand ſtill in the ſtable, and not ſturde. There is alſo a foundring, in letting your horſe drink by the way when he is hot. A ſaying is: ride him in the water but to the paſture, and let him drink being hot, he founders, ride him to the knées, he founders not, ride him to the belly, he founders, which comes by ſodaine cooling in his bodie, which cauſeth a watriſh humour to fall downe to his legs and feete, and will make him caſt his hoofes. Some do founder but afore, and ſometimes on all foure feet: and ſome ſay a horſe may be foundered in traueiling on hotte ſandy waies, and ſodainely to ride him but through a ſhallow water, ye may founder him alſo, by taking cold after a great heat, or by ſtanding ſtil on the ſtones or cold ground, he being hot, or in a cold wind.
                  The foundring in the bodie, the ſignes are theſe, his haire will ſtare, he wil ſeeme chylly and ſhrinke together of all foure, hanging downe his head, forſaking his meate, with quaking after his drinke, and within three or four daies hee will fal a coughing. The beſt remedy is to purge him, by ſome gliſter, or by purging otherwiſe.
                  The foundering in the féete, the ſignes are, he will (within xii. or xxiiii. houres after) crouch on his hinder legges, and Foundring in the feet. his fore feet wil be ſo ſtiffe, that he is not able to moue them, and go as though he could not well tread on the ground, and readie alwaies to ſtumble. Then ſhall ye immediately garter ech legge a handfull aboue the the knée or hough hard with a liſt. Then walke and chafe him to put him in a heat, and when he is warme, let him bloud on both the vaines on the breaſt, and kéepe the bloud, and take a quart or two of that bloud, with two quartes of wheat flower, halfe a pound of bole armeniac, halfe ſo much of ſanguis draconis, with fiue or ſixe egges, and a pint or more of ſtrong vinegar: then mixe them well al together, and chafe al his ſhoulders, back, loynes, breaſt and fore legges therewith, and then walke him on ſome hard ground, and let him not ſtand ſtill: and when all the geare is drie, ye ſhall chafe him with more, and renew it againe, and ſo walk him three or four houres after,

and then ſet him in the ſtable, and giue him a little warme water mixt with ſome malte, and giue him ſome haye and prouender, and then walke him againe either within the houſe or abroad if it be not to colde. And thus ye ſhall vſe him for foure dayes, and when all your oyntment is ſpent, then cloth him warme and let him ſtand and ly warme, and let him eate but little meat for iiii. daies.
                  If he mend not then, it is a ſigne the humour is in his féet, then muſt ye take of his ſhooes and ſearch with your buttres and pare his ſoles afore in the middeſt of his toes, till the water and bloud come forth, and ſo let him bléed well therat. Then ſtop it with hogs greaſe, ſalt, and bruſed nettles, or with turpentine, and hogs greaſe ſo melted together, and laid to with flaxe, and ſome do but ſtop his féet with ſtampt nettles, ſalt, and hogs greaſe, but firſt tacke on his ſhooes, with a lether, and then ſtop him, and put vnder the ſhooe a thinne péece of ſtiffe leather to kéepe in the ſtuffe, and let him run to graſſe, and then ſhift it once a weeke till he bee whole. If ye let him run a quarter, he will be the ſounder. Alſo ſome ſay, if ye let him bloud ſoone after he is foundred aboue his hoofes, that will helpe him from anie further danger. Another way. Others do cut the ſkin on the inſides, or on the fountaine of his legs, the length of a finger, and filles a hollow ſtraw with quickſiluer, and make it flye abroad, and ſo let him remaine till he be whole.
                  Of graueling a horſe, is a fretting vnder the inſide and out Graueling a horſe. ſide of the foot, which will make him to halt, therefore hee will couet to go on his toes. They are ſmall grauely ſtones coming vnder the ſhoo, betwixt the foot and the calking of the ſhoo, or chruſhes, and by long trauaile it wil eate into the quicke. And whereas the ſhooe lyeth flat to the foote, there it will ſoone grauell, and wil not lightly forth againe, and it is ſoone mended at the firſt. The cure: ye ſhall pare the hoofe, & get forth al the grauel cleane, for if ye leaue any grauell it will bréed to a ſorenes called aquitter bone, and then muſt ye ſtop him with turpentine, and hogs greaſe melted together, and laid on tow, or flaxe, then clap on the ſhooe, and keepe it

ſtopt, and ſhift it euery day till it be whole, and let him come in no wet. If ye ſtop it not wel to kéep down the fleſh, it will riſe aboue the hoofe, and then ſhal ye haue more buſines, and put your horſe to more paine.

after, and let him haue white water warme, and this diſeaſe doth often bréede the ſtaggers.
                  The Staggers is an ill ſorenes to heale: It will make the horſe to hold downe his head: And alſo hee will reele to and fro, and forſake his meate, and this procéedeth of the yellowes, and of a corrupt humour in the brayne. His ſight will bee dimme, and hee will bee heauie in going.
                  The cure. They do let him bloud in the temple vayne, and alſo cut the ſkinne on the fore toppe, and with a bucks horne doth raiſe it vppe towardes the head three fingers or more deepe. Then to melt turpentine, and hogges greaſe together, and dippe a tent of flaxe therein, and tent it therewith, and vſe this once a daye till it be whole, and make the like iſſue on his poll behinde, and giue him warme maſhe, and walke him ſoftly once a day.
                  Another. Ye ſhall put a ſponefull of the iuyce of ſelandine into one of his eares, and ſo bind it faſt, and ſo let him remaine and he ſhall mend.
                  Another. Put a little of white ſalte into his eare, and then put in after a ſponefull or two of fayre water, and then knit faſt his eare that hee cannot caſt it out. This is a vſed medicine for this diſeaſe, and a moſt certaine helpe.
                  If anye horſe chaunce to bee gorde with a ſtake or otherwiſe, yee ſhall take and caſt him, and open the wounde as much as yee maye. Then take freſh butter, and boyle it ouer the fyer, and boylyng hot poure thereof into the wounde, and make it runne to the bottome of the wounde if yee can, and let him ſo lye, that it maye go to the bottome. And then lette him reſt till the next morning, and vſe him ſo once a day, till hee bée whole. For this will heale him without anye other thing.
                  To caſt a horſe or other beaſt, yee ſhall binde firſte his head with a ſtrong halter vnto ſome poſt, or tree, then

                  Alſo they ſaie if a Colt doe not caſt his milt when hee is Folling of coltes. folde; he will not liue long after, but die ſodainely within few yeeres after, there is no horſe that doth liue long, which hath any milt in him.
                  Alſo for the ſhooyng of a Horſe, mee thinkes it is connenient Shoing of horſe. that the huſbandman ſhoulde vnderſtande ſomewhat thereof, although in manie places, they doe know better than ſome Smithes. For in moſt places of Englande the Smithes haue ſmall ſkill thereof, but after a common ſorte: howe to ſhooe euerye Horſe as hee ought to bee, they knowe not. Which knowledge doeth conſiſt in diuers pointes, as in good ſtuffe, in making fitte, ſhooes for ouerye horſe foote, in driuing the nayles right, and alſo the making thereof in paring, and leauing the hoofe where it ought to bee, alwayes hauing reſpecte therevnto. For there is as greate a reſpecte vnto the paring, as in the ſhooing, becauſe of the diuerſitie of hoofes, for ſome bee rounde, ſome long, ſome ſhorte, ſome ſmooth, ſome rough, ſome tender, ſome tough, tome flatte, and ſome hollowe: and broade hoofes commonly haue narrowe heeles, which will bee ſoone weake to trauell, or to carrie his ſhooe long: and in goyng lowe on his paſtornes, hee is apte to ſurbat and grauell. The rugged horſe is not ſo muche apte to ſurbat or grauell, but it is a ſigne of vntemperate heate, and drought, which makes the hoofes brittle. A long hoofe commonly treades on the heeles and paſtornes, which breedeth wyndegalles. A broade crooked hoofe without, and narrowe within, it makes him ſplayfooted, and treadeth more inward than outward: going with his ioyntes cloſe together, maketh him to enterfeere, and ſo become ſame. A broade foote inwarde, and narrowe outwarde is not ſo hurtfull, but on the outſide hee will ſoone grauell. A flatte hoofe not hollowe within, is like to a vnperfecte hoofe. A hollowe hoofe will waxe ſoone drye, and that cauſeth hoofe bounde. And the ſtraight, vpright,

and narrow hoofe, will waxe ſoone drie: except hee bee ſtopped, will ſoone bee hoofe bounde: which will cauſe hym to bee ſo lame, that hee cannot treade ſure. And whereas the fruſhes are broade, the heeles are commonlie weake and ſofte, ſo that yee maye eaſily cruſhe them together, and thoſe horſes will neuer treade well on ſtones, or harde grounde. And alſo where the heeles are narrow, they are commonly tender and hoofe bound.
                  The hoofe ought to bee pared euen, that the ſhooe maye fitte cloſe and iuſt thereon, not beeyng in one place Faring the hoofe. more higher than another. And becauſe the weight of the bodie afore lies moſt on the heeles. Therefore to fauour them, take as little as yee maye, but the toes beyng thicke and harde, may be taken the thinner, and the paring of the hinder foote, is cleane contrary to the fore feete: as afore is ſhewed in driuing the nayles, ſaying: before behynde, behinde before, which is, beware the twoo hindermoſt natles on the fore feete, and the two foremoſt nayles on the hinder feete.
                  In ſhooing the fore feete, make your ſhooes, with a broade webbe, and with thicke ſpoonges, meete in all places, Shoyng the fore feete. ſomewhat appearing on the outſide of the ſhoe: And when yee naile or ſet on the ſhooe, ſpare not from the middes forewarde, but beware backwarde towardes the heeles, and yee ſhall pearce the heales wider on the outſide of the ſhoe, then on the inſide, and more diſtant from the toe, then the quarters, becauſe the hoofe is more thicker forewarde then backwarde, and more holde to be taken, the nayles woulde bee made ſtiffe with ſquare heades, and with ſharpe pointes, and meete at the head to fill the holes of the ſhoes, ſtanding a ſtrawe breadth without the ſhoe, and ſo will hée ſtande moſt ſure without ſhaking, and alſo will laſt longer. But that order moſt Smithes doe little regarde, but to diſpatche and awaye, and when they pearce a ſhoe, they commonly make the inſide as broade as the outſide, and theyr nayles are made with ſuche greate ſhoulders, they cannot ſitte well thereon,

nor enter cloſe into the hoales, a

                     ayle wel made ſhoulde haue no ſhoulder at al, but ſtill leſſer and leſſer towarde the poynt. For otherwiſe he wil ſtande ſo high, and the necke thereof being weake, ſoon doth breake, or els bend at euery light ſtroke, as I haue oft ſéene the triall, and the ſhoe thereby ſoone loſt.
                  The nayles alſo would be made flatter on the one ſide Nayles to be made. than the other, with a ſmall poynt, and ſtiffer ſtill towards the head, and when yee driue, ſtrike ſoftly firſt with a light hammer, till it bee well entered. Some doe greace the poyntes (for a tender hoofe,) to goe more eaſter, and firſt yee ſhall driue the two hoofe or ſide nayles of eache ſide one, then looke if the ſhoe ſtande right or not, with the ſpoonges right on the ſides. If not, mende it, and driue your other nayles, and ſette downe then his foote, to ſee if they bee all fitte and wel placed, and the horſe to treade euen thereon. If not, take vp his other foote to make him ſtande more ſtiffer thereon, and with your hammer ſtrike where the ſhoe is ſcanteſt, to make it yéelde that waie. Then driue al the reſt of your nayles, ſo that the poyntes on the hoofe maye come out euen and iuſt, not out of order like the téeth of a ſawe, and ye ſhal clinche, ſo as the poyntes mayebe hidde in the hoofe. Some doe cutte the hoofe a little beneath the nayles, and ſo doe clinche. Then ſhall yee pare and rape the hoofe rounde, ſo that it maie bee euen rounde with the ſhoe, which ſome ſuppoſeth to bee beſt.
                  By paring the broade hoofe, not yet fully growen flatte, it maie bee holpen by a ſkilfull Smyth, dy dyligent Paring & ſhoing the great hoofe. paring and ſhoyng, and at the toe, let hym take as muche as hee canne, but touche not the heeles, except to make the ſhoe ſitte playne: yet lette the hoofe continue ſtrong, and make your ſhoe with a broade webbe, and ſtrong, with broade ſpoonges, and from the tacks nailes to the heele, let the ſhoe appeare a ſtrawes breadth without the hoofe, ſette on with fiue nayles on the outſide, and foure within, becauſe hee weareth more outwarde

then inwarde.
                  To pare the rough and brittle hoofe, hee is commonlie weaker on the outſide, than the on the inſide: and Paring the rough & brittle hoofe. that is, becauſe they are commonly hoater than others, and their hoofes maie bee ſomewhat more opened, to bee the more eaſier ſtopped with Cowe doung, or to annoynt, to keepe them alwayes moyſt. If a hoofe bee ragged on the outſide, it woulde bee wrapped and made ſmoothe, and often to bee ſtopped or annoynted with neates foote oyle, or Turpentine, Sheepes ſuet, and ſallet eyle boiled together, which will make it tougher, and to ſhooe a brittle hoofe, yee muſt make a meane ſhooe, not too light, nor too heauye. For a heauye ſhooe hee will ſoone: caſte and ſette it on with ſeuen, or nine nayles if it bee a large hoofe, fiue without, and foure within.
                  All long hoofe maye bee holpen by paring muche the To ſhoe alōg hoofe. toe. For the ſhorter the hoofe is made, the better it is, and a long hoofe hath commonly a weake and ſlender legge. But a ſhort hoofe hath commonly a ſtrong legge, and the long hoofe hauing a weake legge, is forced moſt to tread on the heele, and on the paſtorne. Yee ſhal pare the reſt like the perfect hoofe, and yee ſhall ſhooe him as rounde as yee canne at the toe, whereby the breadth maie take vp the length. If his hoofe bee narrowe, let his ſhooe beare ſomewhat without the ſides, in making the heeles deeper for eight nailes, and ſette the ſhooe backward enough, becauſe he treadeth muche on the heele, and it will bee the better.
                  Howe to pare a crooked hoofe, yee muſt looke where it is leaſt worne, and pare that euen with the other, not To pare a croked hoofe. touching whereas it is worne, vnleſſe it bee to make it playner. Yee ſhall make his ſhooe ſtrong with a broad webbe, not pearcing the hoales, till yee haue made it fitte for his foote, and then make them as yee ſhall ſee cauſe, and pearce the hoales on the inſide, more towardes the toe, than the outſide. And where the hoofe

is weakeſt, there lette the ſhooe bee ſtrongeſt, ſette on with nine nayles, fiue on the ſtronger ſide, and foure on the weaker.
                  To pare the hoofe called a pomeſt hoofe, or flatte To pare the flatte hoofe, hoofe, yee ſhall pare him playne for the ſhooe, taking ſomewhat of the toe, but touche not the heele or ball of the foote, but leaue it ſtrong, and yee ſhall ſhooe him with a verie broade webbe to couer the weake ſole the better, and make the middes of the webbe more thicke than the outſides, and ſette your ſhooe on hollowe, that it touch no parte of the ball of the foote, and ſee it to bee large and long in al partes, to be the eaſier. Pare him rounde at the toe, and fauour his heeles, and make it with tenne hoales, fiue on eche ſide.
                  The hollowe hoofe, yee ſhall pare rounde, but the hollow hoofe, chiefelie the ſeate of the ſhooe, about the edges, that the hollowneſſe bee not made too deepe, the which yee ſhall keepe alwayes moyſt, for feare of beyng hoofe bound, and yee ſhall pare hym playne in all partes like vnto the perfect hoofe, and yee ſhall make his ſhooes light therevnto.
                  To pare the hoofe with broade fruſhes, hee had the broade fruſhe. little or nothing there to bee touched, but taken at the toe, becauſe of his weake heele. And yee ſhall make hys ſhooe to lye euen thereon, leauing his heeles as ſtrong as yee canne, in making his ſhooe ſtronger towardes the heeles, then the toe: and the webbe of the ſhooe ſomewhat broader towardes the heeles, to ſaue them from the grounde, and giue him nine nailes, becauſe they haue commonlie a broade hoofe, the reſt vſe in all points like the perfect hoofe. the hoofe with narrows heeles.
                  
                  The hoofe that hath narrowe heeles, yee ſhall pare him ſhorte, and make the ſeate of the ſhooe playne, and yee ſhall open it betweene the fruſhe and the heele but a little ſpace, or ſo muche as maie bee ſuffered, for the leſſe yee take of the heele, the better for the Horſe, and

yee ſhal ſhooe him light in a broade webbe, and make the ſpoonges ſo broade as they maie almoſt touche, and ye ſhall pearce the ſhoe more towardes the toe, and ſpare the heeles as muche as yee can, in making it long enough towardes the héeles, and ſetting it on with eight nailes, for the perfect hoofe.
                  The hinder foote is cleane contrarye to the paring of the fore feete, for the weakeſt parte of the hinder foote is before Shoing the binder feete. on the toe, which muſt alwayes bee more ſpared than the heeles: and yee ſhall pare them in all poyntes according to the perfection and imperfection thereof, as vnto the fore feete. Yee ſhall alſo ſhoe them as is aforeſaide: But alwaies make the ſhoe ſtrongeſt towardes the toe, becauſe it is the weakeſt parte of the foote, and yee ſhall make the outſide of the ſhoe alwayes with a Cawkin, and not too high, but agreeyng to the ſpoongye ſide, not ſharpe, but rather turned vp ſomewhat flat therevnto.
                  If your horſe halte, make his ſhoe with a falſe quarter, Shoing with a falſe quarter. not touching the ſore place. If hee halt not, then make his ſhoe with a button ſhouldering on the ſide nexte the toe, to defende the ſame, ſo it touch not, and yee ſhal pare him as afore expreſſed, and with this ſhoe yee maie trauell at pleaſure.
                  The Horſe that doeth enterfeere, hée is commonly Shoing for enterfeering. higher hoofed on the outſide, then on the inſide, and therefore alwayes the outſide woulde bee taken more, and yet be left ſomewhat higher than the inſide, in making the ſhoe fitte, and thicker on the inſide, then the outſide, and without a Caulkin, for that will make him but treade awry, and the rather to enterféere: but let him bee ridden afore you, and then marke where hee toucheth moſt, and in paring hym there, yee maie eaſe it muche, and alſo by ſhoing.
                  The paring of the hoofe bounde, yee ſhall pare the Paring the hoof bound. hoofe bounde at the toe, as ſhorte as yee canne, and ſome

what within on the ſole, but open well his héeles. Yée ſhall make his ſhoo like the halfe Moone. Alſo it haue béene often ſéene by negligent and vnſkilful Smythes, by paring and ſhooing, many horſes oftentimes haue taken hurt. Alſo by the vnſkilful and negligent kéepers, for want of rubbing their legges, and ſtopping their fore féete: for the hinder feet are commonly kept moiſt by meanes of dunglying at their héeles, and wette by their piſſing thereon. Whereas the fore féete ſtand commonly dry, which maketh them to bee hoofe bound, and brittle hooued. Therefore a good kéeper will ſée to ſtoppe them from time to time with cow doong, for that is beſt. And to waſhe their hooues with colde water, and ſometimes annoint them with ſoupling oyles, as neates foote oyle and ſuch. Or with turpentine, and kept An ointment for the hoofe. to annoint therewith at all times conuenient: and this wil make the hoofe tough and ſtrong, and kéepe them from being hoofe bound or brittle hooued. Thus much haue I briefly touched as concerning the paring & ſhooing of horſes, with the diuerſitie of hoofes. He that is deſirous to vnderſtand further herein, let him reade maiſter Blundefieldes Booke of Horſes, and there hee ſhall finde written all thinges more at large, but this ſhall bee ſufficient for all huſband men.
                  Alſo huſbandmen ſaie, the chiefeſt time for mares to be Couering the Mare. couered, is from the ende of the firſt quarter vnto the full of moone, or at the full, for thoſe coltes ſhalbe more ſtronger and harder of nature. Alſo if a mare haue take the horſe and is knit within her, if then another horſe doe couer her, hée burnes her, and ſhee wil dye thereof. Alſo it is not ſo good for mares to be couered after the chaunge, for thoſe coltes commonly wil be neſhe, and tender, and ſoone take ſurfets, and likewiſe thoſe mares that are couered after the full. Alſo marke in the wane, in what time the mare was couered, about the ſame time of the moone ſhe wil foale.

                  The properties of a faire Horſe.
                  To chuſe a good horſe and a fayre, hée ought to be of a good colour, hauing a ſhort haire, a ſmal leane head, with a

broad forehead. Alſo with a mery looke, and wilde of countenance, a ſtout heart, and hardie withal, a ſmal mouth, and long rainde, with a white in the forehead, and wide betwixt the iawes; with open noſtrels, a round chin, ſtiffe and ſmal pricke eares, great eies, broad breaſted, low brawnde, broad ribde, with round ſides, thin creſted, ſtraight backt, with two good fillets, a ſhort rumpe, fat & broad buttocks, with foure good and ſound legges ſtanding vp right one againſt the other, ſmal knées, litle round coddes, thin legges ſhort and black, and round footed hollow and rough, with a ſhort paſtorne, a white foote, and great ſinowes, a ſtiffe docke, with a long taile, a ſhort trotte, wel paſed, eaſie to leape on, ſtil chewing on the bit, ſoone ſtird, ſwift of foote, to turne on a litle ground, and durable in iournying, theſe are the chiefeſt properties in a good and a faire horſe.
                  Alſo there be colours of horſe which are eſtéemed one aboue Colour of horſe of beſt proofe. another, to trauaile. The beſt colour is counted the browne bay with a goldē mouth, and alſo vnder his flancks vp to his nauel of the ſame colour. Hauing riueled lippes, which is a ſigne of feirceneſſe, and likewiſe to haue for his beautie, a white in his forehead, or a white fether on his noſe, either elſe a white foote behinde, with a ſmal head, ſhort eares, wide noſthrils, great eies, broad forehead, long rainde, and thin mane, and the mane hang ouer the right ſide, large breaſted, ſide brawnde, leane and ſmal knées, lathe legged, great ſinowes, ſhort paſtorne, déep ribbed, ſhort loines, broad hollow footed, with a ſwift & large pace, ſmal coddes, and ſtanding vpright, and open of al foure legges, one againſt another, and of ſight to be ſound.

                  Sad Sorrell.
                  ANd next him is the ſad Sorrel with a flexen mane, and a flexen taile, hauing a wall eie on the farther ſide, with a blacke hoofe, for then is he like to be good.

                  The white Horſe.
                  NExt him is the white Horſe, for he commonly is of long life, but he hath a niſe and tender bodie, and alſo dangerous to kéep: for if he be not wel cheriſhed and cleane kept, he wil ſoone alter and decaie, yet hauing the like properties of the firſt Horſe, he wil then labour wel and truely.
               
               
                  The mouſe dunne.

                  The blacke Horſe.
                  THe blacke Horſe is next vnto him, with a white in the forehead, or a white fether on his noſe, or els the further foote white behinde, then is he likely to doe wel.
               
               
                  The cole blacke Horſe.
                  NExt vnto him is the cole blacke hauing no white ſpot on him, which Horſe (as ſome horſe maiſters ſay) is perilous to keepe: for if he continue long with a man, it is maruel if he drowne him not, or hurt him by ſome other way, or els the Horſe to come to ſmal profit.
               
               
                  The yron gray Horſe
                  NExt him is the yron gray, which is counted the worſt colour, for the yron gray Horſes are commonly faint to labour, and il at al aſſaies, for although he be faire of bodie, he may in no wiſe away with any great labour. As for other colours ſkewde or ſpotted Horſe, ſome chance to be good and ſome bad, wherefore there is no certaintie in them, but if the ſire be good, the other may folow. Thus much is ſpoken to be marked of the colour of Horſes. Alſo if ye put a white Horſe to couer a coloured Mare, ſhée ſhal haue commonly a Colt of a ſandie colour, like an yron gray, neither like the ſire nor yet the dambe: yet many Mares wil haue a Colt like the Horſe that gat it.
               
               
                  A Horſe without wartes.
                  THere be ſome Horſe that haue no wartes, which is counted a great fault, and yet that is no maner of ſoreneſſe, hurt, or diſeaſe. But if a Horſe want his wartes on his hinder legges beneath the ſpauin place, if he then be wilde, hée is no chapmans ware, but if hee be wel broken and tame, and haue béen ridden before. Then a ſaying is, beware the

buier: for he hath his eies to ſée, & his hands to féele. There is a ſaying among huſband men, for when that horſe haue liued ſo many yéeres, as the Moone was daies old, when he was foalde, he ſhal ſodenly die.
               
               
                  A Horſe forſpoken a diſeaſe.
                  WHen as your horſe eies doth water, and that he doe therwith begin to mourne, it is calde of ſome huſbands, forſpoken. The remedie is, ye ſhal take a lattin nawle, or bodkin, and daſh it through both his noſthrils aboue, betwéene the griſtle and the bone of his noſe, and there wil come forth plentie of il water and blood, which there haue béen coniealed: when this is done, ye ſhal ſtop both his eares for a day and a night with blacke wool. So done, then vnſtop it againe, and let him blood on both his ſides, and alſo on both the vaines vnder his eares, and ſo he ſhal amend and do wel againe.
               
               
                  The vſuall places to let blood.
                  THe chief places for letting blood are theſe, the two vaines vnder his eies, and the vaines betwéene his noſthrils, and the griſtles of his noſe. Alſo the vaines in the mouth and vnder the toong: & the two vaines of both ſides of the necke which to be launſt a handful from the head. And likewiſe on the ſhalke vaines. Alſo the two great vains on the ſides, and the two branched vaines that leadeth from the coddes. And againe, the two vaines vnder his taile, theſe are the chiefe and common places which do ſerue for to let blood againſt moſt diſeaſes. And this I thinke here ſhalbe ſufficient for letting of blood.
               
               
                  Againſt the Glanders.
                  THere comes oftentimes vnto yoong horſe of foure or fiue yéeres old (by catching cold after his labour) a kinde of glanders, and it wil on a ſodeine raiſe aſwelling vnder his

iawes and on his iawe bone, which ſwelling at the firſt wil beverie harde, without great heate: and there wil remaine and bréede to ſome other ſore, if ye helpe it not. The cure. Ye ſhall take hogges greaſe, and make it verie hot, and ſo all hot ye ſhal rub and chafe the ſore and hard place therewith, twiſe or thriſe a day, vſe it, and that will mollifie it, and at length it wil ſo breake and runne, and ſo heale againe.
               
               
                  To heale the mangie on a Horſe.
                  YE ſhal take of lampe oyle, the fine pouder of brimſtone, of blacke ſope, of tarre, of barrow hogges greaſe, and the ſoote of a chimney, of each a like. And then mix them all wel togither, and boyle them togither, and then annoint the place therewith as hotte as he may ſuffer it, and vſe this, and it wil helpe.
               
               
                  Againſt the mourning of the Chine.
                  TAke a pecke, or halfe of oates, and boyle them in running water til halfe the licour be conſumed: and then put them into a bagge, and laie them all hotte vpon the nauel place on his back, and there let it lye thirtie houres, and ſo dreſſe him therewith thrée or foure times, and ye ſhal ſée experience.
               
               
                  For a Horſe that is hide bound.
                  WHen a horſe is hide bound, yée ſhall perceiue it by plucking vp his ſkinne on his ſides. If his ſkinne bee loſe, hee is not hide bounde, but if it ſticke cloſe to his ſides or ribbes, ſo that ye can ſcant take hold thereof, then hee is hide bounde, which is commonly gotten in winter by lying wet, and hauing ſmall ſtore of meate, which maketh him verie faint. The remedies are, yee ſhall let him bloud a litle, and then giue him warme mafhes morning

and euening. And white water, which is water and mault Mixt togither, or branne. And giue him alſo ſodde wheat, mixt with branne or ſodde barley. Uſe this as yée ſhall ſée cauſe, and he ſhal doe wel.
               
               
                  To plump or puffe vp a leane Horſe, in ſhort time.
                  THe beſt meanes to puffe vp a leane horſe is, to ſée the barley in water till it be ſoft like firmitie, and thicke withall, or to ſée the wheate likewiſe. And giue him thereof alwaies before his watering, not after: for then it wil do him no good. For this the huſband man ſaith, all dry prouender or corne after watering to be giuen, and all ſod corne afore watering, ſpecially barley, and wheate being ſod.
               
               
                  Againſt anie galling or fretting through the skin of a Horſe.
                  IF your horſe chaunce to bee fretted with halter or other corde, cleane through the ſkin, yée ſhall take but vinegar and ſope, and heate them wel togither, and ſtirre it with a ſticke or cloth, and then all to rubbe and waſh the ſaid fretting or galling therewith: vſe this twiſe or thriſe a day, and it wil dry it vp within two or thrée daies, and it will heale againe. For this is the huſband mens common medicine, and wel prooued. If there be galling on the necke, ye ſhall ſtamp the leaues of bryony, (called the hedge vine,) and mixe it with wine, and plaiſter it too, and it wil helpe.
               
               
                  How to take out the haw in the Horſe eye.
                  THe haw breadth comonly (as cunning horſe Leches ſay), by rankeneſſe of blood, and groſſe fleame, which by heates doeth bréede vnto a harde white griſtle: in the forecorner

of the horſe eye, which wil at lengh, make him to loſe his ſight, if it be not ſoone remedied. The cure.
                  The ſureſt and beſt way to take foorth the hawe, and not periſhing the horſe eye, is this. Firſt, (for the more ſafetie, tramell his legges on the one ſide. Then put a paire of barnacles on his noſe, and another on his fartheſt eare, and ſo let one holde them faſt. Then the maiſter doeth put a néedle with a double thread through the toppe of his eare, on the ſame ſide the haw is. And then from thence, hée putteth the néedle through the edge of his eye lidde, on the midſt thereof, and ſo drawe vp the lidde towardes the ſaid eare, and then faſtens the thread and cuttes it off. Then knits his thread againe, and ſaies to his man hold faſt, (for feare of ſtarting of the horſeꝭ, the néedle head may put out his eye.) Therefore to woorke ſure is beſt. Then the maiſter waites when the horſe turnes his eye, and when the ſaid haw is moſt ſéene, then hee catches holde thereof with his fore finger and thombe, and pluckes it foorth a litle: and puts his néedle through the outer end of the griſtle, and ſo drawes it farther out by the threades ende: and then wrappes the reſt of the ſaid thread about his litle finger of the ſame hande, he puttes out the inner ſide of the griſtle which is towardes the horſe eye, and with a verie ſharpe knife, hee cuttes croſſe the griſtle, and eaſeth finely away the ſkinne and fatte thereof, on the ſaide haw. And alſo rounde about it, which is calde the waſhe of the eye: for if that bee cutte away, the horſe will bee bleare eide. Therefore yée muſt leaue all the ſkinne and fat about the ſaide griſtle, and take away but the tippe, or out ende thereof with the ſaide griſtle or haw,) which the threade hath holde of: but take not too much holde with your néedle and thread. Then beeing taken foorth, cut off your thread that holdes his eye lid, and picke out the ends thereof out of his eye lidde and eare, elſe they wil afterwarde trouble him, and alſo plucke away al the long hayres about his eyes. Then ſoone after, as the horſe

eye doe gather to ſome blood and matter: yee ſhall take your mouth ful of béere, ale, or wine, (and open his eye) and ſpirt therein once or twiſe togither, and with the ſide of your hand ſtrike downe the blood and matter out of his eye. Uſe him thus thrée or foure times, vntil his eye wax cleare, and ſo it is done, ye may giue him what meate yée wil after.

They are bred by euill meate, and fault of drinking good water. The cure. Ye ſhall caſt into his mouth faſting, the guts of a young pullet, and make him to ſwallow it downe in holding vppe his head: do this three mornings, and let him not eate nor drinke of v. houres after verye little. Alſo ſome do vſe to bruſe french broome, and giue it among good prouender, and ſalte water to drinke. Others do alſo giue the horſe of greene braunches of willow, or Sallow, or reedes, and in digeſtion of his meat he ſhall caſt out thoſe wormes.
               
               
                  To helpe ſinewes troubled with humoures.
                  BOyle the meale of lineſéed and hony in like portion together, with ſome white wine, and make thicke as a plaiſter and ſo put it on: and ye ſhall ſée it come to good proofe.
               
               
                  Againſt ſhot impoyſoned
                  WHen a horſe is hurt by ſome poyſoned yron, or ſhot, take the ſweat of an other horſe, with toſted or burnt bread, mixe them together with mens vrine, and make the horſe to ſwallow it downe, and put greaſe of a hog into the wounde with the like mixture, and he ſhall mend.
               
               
                  Falling of haire in a horſe taile.
                  THe falling of haire commonlye is when he hath to much bloud, or when he traueleth to much on the waye, or is beaten on the tayle, whereof comes ſometimes ſcabbes with ſhedding his haire. The cure. If this happe in the tayle, ye ſhall race the out part vnto the middeſt of the fourth bone or ioynte of the tayle, and take forth that bone

called of ſome bariuole, which ye ſhall take out cleane, and betwixt the ſenture and the body bee coctures or ſtringes ſome what deepe, which ye ſhall ſoftly touch with a hotte yron, and a little ſalte, and in each fent yee ſhall gently put a broach of wood, which muſt remaiue ix. daies, if they fall not awaye of themſelues.
               
               
                  The canker in the tayle of a horſe.
                  THere comes a diſeaſe in the tayle of a horſe, called (in french) Langie: and will eate the fleſh of his tayle in manner of a canker, ſo that the haire will fall awaye, for the bones are corrupt. If yet ſee not vnto it betimes, all the tayle will corrupt. The cure. Make a head boulſter of cloth verye ſtrong for it, and wette it in vinegar within and without, and ſo binde it faſt on the ſore, and alwaye when it waxeth drye, yee muſt wette it agayne.
                  Do this twiſe or thriſe a day, if it be done oftener, it is the better. So ſhall yee continue for thrée or foure dayes, and then yee muſt heale it as yee heale a greene wound.
               
               
                  For a horſe euill diſpoſed and very heauie in trauaile.
                  YE ſhall cutte the ſkinne betweene the fore legges, and then make a ring of a vine branch, and put it into the cut place betwixt the ſkinne and the fleſh, (like a rowell) and then hee ſhall trauell ſurely againe.
               
               
                  For a horſe that is to fat to make him leane.
                  TO make your horſe leane, that is verie fatte, yee ſhall giue him branne mixt with honye and warme water,

and ſo it ſhall abate his fatnes without trauell.
               
               
                  To know the differences betwne a horſe bewitched and other ſoreneſſe.
                  YE ſhall marke this in a horſe (as in other cattell) that when they be ſicke or diſeaſed naturally, the griefe will often times alter againe by litle and litle, and ſo to mend. Or els it will increaſe by leaſure, and not to come ſo vehemently, as when he is bewitched. For the farcie in a horſe will riſe in knobs and bunches, and will ſo continue a long time or they breake out. And yet the horſe (ſo infected) will eate dayly his meate: But if he be bewitched he will eate no meate, becauſe he is ſo inflamed with ſuch poyſon in his body, ſo that within xii. houres manie die, or like to die. Some are ſtriken with knobbes and bunches riſing in their bodies, with lamenes of linunes. Some with running at their noſtrels matter and flegme. Some their eiesſwelling and hanging out of their head: with flegme and matter roping and running. Some ſodainely falle and ſo die. Some run about in fieldes as they were mad, and drowne themſelues in pits and ponds of water, with diuers other infinite waies they vſe in bewitching mens cattell, which here I will paſſe ouer. But when ye ſhall doubt of any ſuch thing: the beſt is to ſéeke remedy betimes: or the poyſon go through his body. For if it tarry any ſpace, it will be paſt remedy.
               
               
                  Sinewes and nerfes broken or bruſed.
                  IF Sinewes or nerfes be broken or bruſed, or hurt by ſome ſore or otherwiſe, ye ſhall lay thereon the fleſh of a tortue, well mixt and beaten, with the powder of mullen hearbe. But if the nerfes and ſinewes be bruſed and hurt within, ye ſhall then burne it round like a circle with a hot yron in xii. ſmall circles or leſſe, and ſo he will mend againe.
               
               
                  
                  An ointment to repaire the fleſh in a Wound.
                  TO repaire and to heale fleſh in a wound, yee ſhall make this ointment. Take wormewood, pimpernell, callamint or 
                        •
                     ep, of bawme, and waxe, of each a quantitie, beat them all together well, and then boile it ouer the fier vntill it be mixt wel all together: then couch or ſtéepe a péece of linnen therein, and lay it on the ſore. This ointment healeth marueilous well, and repaireth the fleſh againe.
               
               
                  To heale the canker on a horſe.
                  TAke the iuice of daffadill rootes vii drams, the iuice of hounds tongue a like, of vnfleckt lyme iiii, drams, of arſenit powder ii. drams, beat all theſe wel together, and put them in a new cleane veſſel of earth cloſe couered, then boile it till it be all reſolued: firſt waſh the canker wounde with ſtrong vinegar warme. Then fill the canker wound twiſe a day with the ſaid compound, till it be kilde, and fall away.
               
               
                  Againſt tyring of a horſe on the way.
                  IF your horſe chance to tyer on the way, if ſpurre, and wande will not profit, ye ſhall put three or foure rounde peble ſtones into one of his eares, and ſo knit faſt his eare that the ſtones fall not out, and they will ſo rattle within his eare, that he will then go faſter if he haue any ſprite or power. Some do thruſt a bodkin through the middeſt of the flap of his eare, and put therein a pin of wood, and euer whē he flackes his pace, the rider will ſtrike on that eare with his wand, and ſo he will mend his pace thereby.
                  Alſo if your horſe in trauaile do waxe dull on the waye,

ye ſhall ſiice a péece of freſh béefe, and bind it about his bit, and thereon he will che
                        •
                      on the way, whereby he will continue and trauell well after.
               
               
                  To helpe the found ring of a horſe
                  IF your horſe be hot ryding on the way, and you ryding through a ſhallow water, letting your horſe ſtay to take but a ſippe of water, it will founder him. Ye ſhal perceiue it, for he wil often trip vnder you within a quarter of a mile riding. The remedy. Ye ſhal let him bloud as ſoone as ye can, on the to vaine vnder of all foure feet, ye may ſtop the bloud with bolearmeniac, or but pinch it with your thumb and finger, both parts of the vaine, the vpper and the nether together, and that wil ſtanch them, ſo you may ride your horſe againe on the morrow as ſafe as before. Wel proued. But if he be foundred by heat of trauel in hot ſandy way, and not ſoone remedied, it will be long to heale: And perhaps aſcend to the ioint of the fether locke, and ſhrinke the ſinewe, which wil cauſe him to halt and trip. The remedy: take the roots of nettles, and hemlocke, with elder pils, of ech a handful, boile them tender in bores greaſe, or freſh barrowes greaſe, ſo let him bloud in the mids of his foot on the to vaine, then bath & chafe his ioint and leg therwithal about from his knée to the fetherlock, and then clap it to, & bind a cloth faſt to, as hot as ye can, ſo vſe this once a day, til he be wel, and this wil help: wel proued. And anonint his legs with ſuppling oiles.
               
               
                  For wolues teeth in ſome horſe.
                  Alſo ſome horſes haue wolues téeth on the vpper iawes, & that horſe cannot grind wel his meat, becauſe the fleſh will thruſt betwene, when he would griud, which will let him greatly for féeding. Which teeth ſome defile thē ſmoth with a rape, and ſo after they wil weare ſmoth, in doing this they do vſe to caſt the horſe.
                  
                     
But if a horſe do ouer reach his nether grinders with his vpper, which ye mine féelle perceiue by ſight, or by féeling; for his vpper téeth wil lie ouer the nether like a bunch on his chéekes, and that horſe cannot eate haie, or hardly eate anie rough meat, but it wil lie in lumps in his cheekes, and vnder his tongue, which griefe is gotten (as ſome iudge) by feding in watrie and mamiſh groandes in winter, & thereon comes looſenes of féeth, and when a horſe is ſo, there is no helpe or remedie that I can learne but this caſt him, and pricke his gums, and ſo let them bloud, then rub them with ſage, & ſalt, and ſo they wil 
                        •
                     aſt againe: ſo vſe it viii. or x. daies after. For the more ſurer, but to féed him with prouender is beſt, as wt bread, and graines, bran, ground malt, and ſuch, which will be coſtly to kéep: but ſo he will labour and ſerue a long time wel. In ſommer ye may put him to graſſe, and ſo he will do wel. Thus much for wolues téeth in ſome horſe, and ouer reaching téeth, and alſo for looſe téeth in a horſe.
               
               
                  Againſt the bloud, or pluriſie of bloud.
                  THe diſeaſe of the bloud is, ſome young horſes will féede, and being fat, wil increaſe bloud, and ſo grow to a pluriſie, and ſome die thereof, if he haue not ſoone helpe, he will ſometimes ſtand and eate no meate, his eies will ſéeme red, his head and body hot, and he will look heauily, and ſodainly in eating he wil fal and die. The remedy is, ye ſhall let him bloud on the liuer vaine, and ſo he ſhall do wel againe.
               
               
                  For a horſe that is ſwolne with much wind in his body.
                  SOme horſe with eating certaine windy meate or ſuch hearbs, wilbe ſo ſwoln therwith as the his belly woulde burſt, & then he wil eate no meat, but ſtand & hang down his head, ready to fal, and ſo die, if he haue not ſpéedy helpe.
                  
                     
When ye ſhall ſée any horſe ſo, the next remedy as I can learne i
                        •
                     ye ſhal take a ſharpe pointed knife, or bodkin, and arme it ſo with ſome ſtay, that it go not to déep, for pearcing his guts. Then ſtrike him therewith through the ſkin into the body, before the hollow place of his haunch bone, halfe a foote beneath the backe bone, and the wind will come out thereat. Then if ye put a hollow euill therein, (or ſome father to kéepe it open a while,) the wind will voide the better and ſo heale againe. When a horſe is ſo, ſome do rake him, and ſome do ride him, to make him breake and voide winde: but this hath bene proued the beſt remedy to ſaue your horſe or oxe.
               
               
                  Againſt looſe teeth in a horſe.
                  A Horſe being grieued with looſenes of téeth, he cannot eate but will fumble, and ſlauer his meat in his mouth, and may not ſwallow it downe, but chew it and ſolye in lumps (for the moſt part) on both ſides his iawes: The moſt meat he can ſwallow is graſſe, and prouender. This diſeaſe is gotten by féeding in wet paſtures and wet groundes in winter, and thereby his gums will ſhrinke from his teeth, and ſo they will be looſe and ſéeme long.
                  For ſome horſe which hath bene howſed in winter, will ſoone take this griefs, as the red ſorell, aſſoone as any other. The remedy. Ye ſhall let him bloud on the vaine vnder the taile nye the rumpe, and then rub his gums with ſage, tide on a ſtickes end. Alſo ye ſhall giue him for a while, the tender crops of blacke bryers with his prouender, and ſo he ſhal do well againe.
               
               
                  For wormes in the maw.
                  IF wormes be in the maw of a horſe. Take great wormes and clenſe them, and ſhels of egges, beat theſe both togeſmall

with a hammer, and put to a quauite, and pepper, and ſo mixe them all together, and being warme, put it downe the horſe throat.
               
               
                  For proude fleſh in a wound.
                  FIrſt ye ſhall waſh the wound with wine, wherein is ſob nettle ſéede Then ſtraw thereon a little of the 
                        •
                     ine powder of verdigreaſe: and this will take it away. Uſe this as ye ſée cauſe.
               
               
                  To make a horſe to ſcoure or laxatiue.
                  YE ſhal giue him among his prouender one ounce of brimſtone beaten to ſmall powder, and this will maks him to ſcoure. Alſo ſome giue a rye ſhefe, ſome make a drinke with polypodium and ſpurge ſod in ale, and the roots of the water flagge ſtampt, and boile them in ale, and ſtraine it, and milke warme giue it, a pint thereof to each horſe, faſting, and kéep him warme after.
               
               
                  Another way to heale the mange in a horſe.
                  LEt him bloud on both ſides the necke, if hee bee a young horſe. Then cut the ſkin downe the mids of his forehead two fingers broad, or long downe right, then open the ſkinne an inch wide on both ſides the cut, and put therein thinne ſlices of the gréene root of Ellecampane, or Angelica, which is better. So let them remaine vnder the ſkin till the matter rot, then cruſh it forth in two or three daies, and in xii. daies the rootes will fall as it healeth, and this will helpe: but yee muſt annoint the mange with brimſtone in fine powder, with verdigreaſe, oile oliue, het and mixt all together.
               
               
                  A perfect and proued way to heale the farcy or faſhion in a horſe.
                  TAke iii. ounces of quickſiluer, halfe a pound of hogs greaſe

of verdigreaſe an ounce, ye ſhall firſt kill your quickſiluer in a bladder, with a ſpone full or two of the iuice of an orringe, or a limon, in rubbing and chafing them in the bladder till the quickſiluer be cleane kild. Then put your hogs greaſe in a morter, or diſh, with your verdigreaſe, ſo beat them well together. Then put to your quickſiluer, and beat thē al well together, and ſo kéep it, and when your horſe hath thē faſhion or farcy, in riſing on the vaines like knobs and bunches, then annoint them round, and all ouer thoſe knots or bunches. Uſe this once a day, or as ye ſhall ſée cauſe, for they wil go no further, but grow to a matter, and when ye ſhall feele them ſoft, launce them, and the matter will run out, and ſo daie by and heale againe. Alſo in the nointing him, ye ſhall put into each of his eares one good ſponefull of the iuice of ragwart, ſome call it ſlylote, a weede growing in field: and this will helpe him in few daies.
               
               
                  Againſt the ſwelling vnder a horſe iawes.
                  FOr the ſwelling vnder or betwéene the horſe iawes: take his owne dung hot as ſoone as he makes it, and with a cloth bind it faſt thereto. Uſe this twiſe a day, and it will be

                  To make a horſe ſtale.
                  MIxe wine and oyle together, and rub and chafe it on his loynes, or put a louſe into his yard, or put ſope in his yard, if theſe helpe not, ſquirt of honied water ſod, then cold, into his yard with ſome ſalt.

                  Teeth changing or falling.
                  A Horſe hath forty teeth: in the xxx. moneth after his foling, he looſeth two aboue, and two beneath. Againe in the fourth yere he looſeth iiii. téeth, two aboue, and two beneath, on the fift yeare he caſteth the reſt both aboue and beneath, & thoſe that come firſt be hollow teeth aboue. At vi. yeares his hollow téeth are filde vp, and in the vii. yeare all the reſt are fild vp. Of this age ye can no longer iudge by his teeth. But if ye plucke vp the ſkinne of his iawes or cheekes, if they fall ſoone ſmoth againe, is a ſigne he is young. But if they fall wrincled, he is old. And like of other beaſtes. The horſe groweth not after vi or vii. yeares, the mare groweth not after v. yeares. And to haue them bring faire colts, let them not be horſt but euery other yeare.

And of the other commeth out black matter which fretteth the ſinews and ioynt, and that is vncurable. This take alwaies for a generall rule.

                     Is counted for man one of the beſt.
                     No harmefull beaſt nor hurt at all.

                        AS our chiefe commoditie is to haue great cattel, ſo is there a chiefe comditie to nouriſh, keepe and féede ſmal cattell, as ſheepe one of the chiefeſt & fruitfulleſt for the vſe of man. For of theſe beaſts cometh a yearely fléece, and are kept with ſmall trouble or any other great paine, but in kéeping them from cold in winter, daggin in ſommer, ſcabbe, bloud, and ſuch other inconueniences which cometh vnto them as well as any other catell.
                     Therfore muſt ye take ſome paine to ſée thē kept in fields & paſtures as wel as in houſes. There is no man that loueth ſheepe but will haue a chiefe care of them, to vſe and order them as they ought to be, conſidering all the commodities ye comes by them, and to kéep their houſes cleane & warme in winter, with their foldes alſo wel ſet and ordered in ſomer. The ſhepheard ought to bee of a good nature, wiſe, ſkilfull, countablo, and right in all his doings, wherein few is to bée found at this preſent. Specially in villages and towns: that by their idlenes & long reſt, they grow new to wax ſtubborn and are giuen (for the moſt part) to frowardnes and euill, more then to good profit to their maiſters, and euil manered, whereof bréedeth many théeuiſh conditions, being pickers, lyers, and ſtealers, and runners about from place to place, with many other infinite euils. Which contrarie was in ye firſt ſhepheards of Egipt, & other in their time, for they were ye firſt inuentours of aſtrologie and iudgement of ſtars, and finders out of phiſicke, augmenters of muſicke, and many other liberall ſciences.
                     I cannot tell whether I ought to ioyne the art of knighthood, and the gouernment of kingdomes, but by their long continuance in the fieldes, and manye yeares ſéeing and viewing out of their cabbins, by experiences obſerued

the courſe of the ſtarres, the diſpoſition of times, and by long vſe in marking the ordered times and vnſtedfaſtnes of daies in ſuch ſort continuing that the ancient ſhepheards became people of great knowlege: As witneſſeth Hierogliphiques: and therefore al huſbands ought to haue a great care in chooſing of good ſhepheards.
                     Shéepe (as wel as others) ought to be the firſt cattell to be looked vnto, if ye marke the great profite that cometh by them: for by theſe cattell wee are chiefely defended from colde, in ſeruing many waies, in couerings for our bodies. They do not onely nouriſh the people of the villages, but alſo to ſerue the the table with many ſortes of delicate and pleaſant weates: In ſome countries their milke doth ſerue in ſteede of furmentie, of which are the people of Scithia, cald Nomades. And alſo the gréekes do name them, Galactopotes, that is to ſay, drinkers of milke: and for ſo much as theſe cattell are tender and delicate, as Celſus doth affirme. Therefore good heede muſt be taken vnto them for ſickenes, yet they are commonly in health, except at ſome times they are ſubiect to the murren ſcabbe, or peſtilence, in changing of groundes. Therfore they muſt be choſen agreable to the nature of the place where they ſhal remain, which is a rule meet to be obſerued and kept, not onely in theſe cattell, but alſo in all other cattell of huſbandrie, whereof Virgill ſaith:
                     All groundes for all thinges is not good, nor meete for all beaſtes to get their foode. For the fatte Champion and paſture fieldes is good to nouriſh great ſhéep: for leane ſhéepe and hoggerslles in cloſes. And ſheepe well fleſht, they ſhall do well in Foreſts, and mountaines, drye places, and playne commons: and all ſeuered cloſes are good and commodious to nouriſh all tender ſhéep, and to make them battle, and ſo to fatte well. There is a great reſpect to be had vnto the differences of nature, not onely in the ſortes and bréede of ſhéepe, but alſo of their colours and chooſing them, for experience doth ſhewe, as the ſheepe of Mileſie in Athens bee great, verye fayre, and

well eſtéemed. Alſo thoſe ſhéepe of Calabria and of the Appolitans, and thoſe of Tarent, and now theſe in Fraunce, be more eſtéemed and prayſed, and ſpecially the ſhéepe of Torcello, and next vnto theſe, thoſe of the leane champains as be beſide Parma, and Medena in Italie.
                     
                     Alſo the white colour in ſhéepe is very good & profitable, as we vſe here moſt in England: For of this colour a man may make many other. And the white will kéepe alſo his colour long. The blacke and the browne be alſo well praiſed, which be much vſed in Italie at Pollentia, and alſo in high Spaine at Corube. The yellow ſhéepe bee in Aſie, the which they call red ſaſarned ſhéepe. Truly tha vſe therof we haue had alreadie by diuers and many experiences of thoſe kind of ſhéepe. For in Africa, where they are brought (from the towne called Gaditane, and there about) are wild rams of ſtrange and maruelous colours, with manie other kind of beaſts, which are oft times brought vnto the people to make paſtimes. Marcus Collumella ſaith, a man of a ſingular good wit and vnderſtanding, and verie perfect in huſbandrie, which brought one of thoſe Rams of Africke with him into Fraunce, and did put him in his paſtures, and when hee became gentle, he made him to bee put vnto his yewes, which ramme begat in the beginning all hearie lambs, and like in colour. But after that the ſaid lambs had beene couered againe once or twiſe, their wooli began againe to be gentle, ſoft, and fayre. And at length thoſe lambs engendring with their ſhéepe, made their fléece and wooll as ſofte as gentle as ours. This Collumella recorded, that from the nature of the ramme, by the alteration of the place and cattell, they became againe to their firſte eſtate. And by little and little, by good order and gouernment, their wilde natures be cleane changed. So likewiſe diuers beaſts become ſoone gentle by well vſing thereof in huſbandrie, which afterward they are found alwaies tame and gentle. Thus I leaue here, and and wil returne to my former purpoſe.
                     There be two ſorts of ſhéepe cattell, the better ſort is

thoſe of the ſoft wooll, and the other the hairy wooll, and for to ſhewe howe to buy theſe twaine, there is many common rules, neuertheles, there is alſo particulars for the better ſort, the which ye muſt take good héed of.
                     The common rules to buy are theſe, when his wooll is white, faire, and long ſtaple, and plaine. Ye ſhal neuer chooſe a very white ram: and yet oftentimes a white ram will get a blacke lambe, but a yellow or blacke ram, wil neuer get a white lambe. Ye muſt not chooſe a ram by his whitenes onely, but when the pallace of his tongue is of the ſame colour of his wooll. For when either of theſe two do not agrée, the lambe is like to be blacke, or ſpotted in ſome part, as Virgill ſignifieth by theſe verſes.

                           The ram among thy ſheepe out pull,
                           Though he be white of ſkin and wooll,
                           Marke well his tongue and thereto ſee,
                           If tongue and fell do both agree:
                           For if they alter in any caſe,
                           Their lambs ſhall follow the ſelfe ſame race.
                        
                     
                     Likewiſe the ſelfe ſame reaſon is of the yellow and blacke ſheepe as is afore declared: Which ought not to haue their tongue of a contrarie colour to their wooll. But in all parts to be like vnto the fléece and wooll: although the ſkinne bee ſpecky and ſpotted of diuers colours, it is no matter. And ye muſt ſée that ye buy no ram nor other ſhéep that hath a thin ſtaple, or ſmall ſtore of wooll: And for the better knowledge to ſée that they be al of one colour, principally is to conſider in chooſing your rams, for the ſpotty rams wil commonly be ſéene in the lambs.
                     The rams are much eſtéemed when they are hye and long of bodie, with a large belly and couered wel with wool, Rams eſtemed his tatle long and thicke in wooll, his forhead broad, his coddes big, his hornes crooked or writhen: and yet theſe ſort of rammes are not the beſt. For thoſe which haue no hornes are more better: and thoſe which haue crooked hornes do more hurt, for the one doſh annoye the other: and it is yet better to haue theyr hornes crooked and writhen,

then to be ſtraight and open. Neuertheleſſe in countries moiſt and windie, they were better to haue the rams with great and larger hornes, then other without, becauſe it doth kéepe and defend the greateſt parts of their head from the winde and ſtormes. If the winter bee verye ſtormye in thoſe countries, they chooſe thoſe Rammes: but if it be calme and gentle, they take thoſe which haue no hornes. For the horned ramme hath this diſcomoditie, hée feeleth by nature each parte of his bodye ſo well armed, that hée deſireth nothing but to fight with other. And hee is more hotter after the yowes at all tymes, and more importunate then others: So that he will not ſuffer anye other ramme to couer any troope of yowes, and he wil haue warre without cauſe againſt his fellowes, and will not permit or ſuffer them to couer anye yowe, although he can do no more himſelfe, and yet hee will haue all at his commandement.
                     But he which is without hornes knoweth he is vnarmed, whereby he is not ſo readie to fight, and is alſo of leſſe heat: therefore ye may haue the more rammes. The good Ram

                           to correct. and ſkilfull ſhepheard in correcting the heat and furie of ſuch an vnſatiable ramme, may by this ſubtelty. Take a ſtrong boord of a foot brode, and fill it full of pikes of yron, and tye that boord to his hornes with the pikes towarde his forhead, and this ſhall keepe him from hurting of others, for in giuing his head a ſtroke, hee ſhall hurt him ſelfe.
                     
                        Epicarmus de Syracuſis in Sicilia, which hath diligently written of the medicines for cattell, hee ſaith: one may appeaſe or abate the furie of ſuch a ram in pearcing his hornes by his eares (with a wimble or pearcer) againſt the place where as they crooke. Alſo the age of a ramme to couer, is beſt at three yeares. And hee ſhall be good vnto viii. yeares, the yowes would bee couered after two yeares, and then they will be good v. yeares after, and the ſeuenth yere being once paſt, then they begin to waxe weake & will faile in getting lambs againe, as I haue ſaid, ye ſhall not buye ſheepe vnſhorne, nor to make to greate account

of them which haue gray or ſpotted wooll of diuers colours, for the vncertaintie thereof. Thou ſhalt caſt them of as the barren ſhéepe; and alſo thoſe which haue moſt téeth, being of three yeares olde. Therefore ye muſt chuſe theſe of two yeares, hauing a great large bodie, a long necke, and long déepe wooll, not rough or ſtubborne, his belly great and large of body, couered all with wooll, not to be vncouered in any part, nor yet ſmall of ſtature, his gums ruddy, his téeth white and euen, his ſkin on the briſket red, and on both ſides ruddie, his eie ſtringes ruddie, his fell looſe, his wooll faſt, his breath long, and his féete not hot. Theſe are the chiefe ſignes of a ſound ſheep. Signes of a rotten ſheep are theſe. His belly full of water, his fat yellow, his liuer ſhalbe knottie and ful of bliſters, and if ye ſeeth it, it will breake in péeces, his ſides pale, his eies pale and darke, his gums white, and the wooll will ſoone come of: if ye plucke a little thereof. Theſe are the ſignes of a rotten ſhéepe or vnſound.
                     Now for to ſaue and keepe them, ye ſhal vnderſtand your ſhéepe houſes ought to be made low (like vnto a hogge ſtye) and more in length then in breadth, warme for winter, and not ſtraite of romes, for feare of hurting the lambes, paued and boorded on the ſides, and within the place (in deſcending) of their vrine and dung. It ſhall bee alſo good to hang of roſe marye, or other ſweete and ſtrong hearbes for to take away or kil the ſent of their vrin and dung. It ſhall be alſo good to make and ſet the houſe open towards the ſun at noone, and to be well couered, for theſe kind of cattell are tender and cannot abide any great colde.
                     Yet although they are houſed, they are oftentimes vext with cold, as reumes, glanders, coughes, and ſuch, & ſo vexed with cold in witer, as well as with heat in ſommer, and afore or about their houſes, it were good to make a cloſe coa well and hye fenſed, ſo that they maye go forth of their howſes in ſafetye to refreſh them. And their Rackes to bes made two foote high from the earth, with racke ſtaues ſette nigh together of a good length. And the ſhepheard muſt ſée, that they bee cleane kept, and to ſee

that the rackes doe ſtand faſt for hurting anie of them.
                     They muſt alſo be kept that they haue no water or other moiſture, and that there be prepared of Fearne or drie ſtraw, for thoſe which haue lambes to reſt more cleaner and ſofter, and to ſée that the rammes goe not with the Eawes, or the lambes: nor goe with anie ſick ſhéepe or other beaſt, and it is better to let the lambes remaine in the houſe, than to goe with their dammes a field. And good to let your beſt paſture remaine for your yeawes nigh your ſhéepe houſes. The ſhepheard alſo ſhal often cleanſe the fodering places of his ſhéep, and reſerue it to litter his kine and horſe, and ſo to kéepe their houſes cleane, wherby their health maie be the better preſerued, and ſo in anie wiſe they be not hurt or annoyed with filthie moiſture, for they are tender and nice, and doe loue cleane places. Yée muſt alſo ſee that they haue good ſtore of meate, for hunger in them breedes the murren. A ſmall ſtocke well nouriſhed, encreaſeth muche more profite vnto their maiſter, then others with twiſe ſo great a flocke enduring hunger. And alſo the ſhepheard muſt often driue them ouer changeable paſtures and groundes, wheras there Thornes or ſcratches. is ſcant of feeding, and without thornes or buſhes, vſing after the authoritie of Virgill, which ſaith by there verſes following.

waxe looſe and diminiſhe euerie daie, ſo muche more as it doth grow and increaſe. Theſe beaſts are alwaies in daunger of thornes growing where as they are, and oft times therewith they are tied with hookes and ſnares, thornes and briers, which doth teare both wooll and ſkinne, and theſe Cattell being tender and delicate, thereby leeſeth a greate parte of their wooll, which other waies woulde kéepe it, & for their coupling together of them, all other Authors doeth agree, and ioynes together in one conſent, that the bearing Putting the Ramme. or lamming time, is at the Spring, about the twentie or one and twentie of Aprill. For then the ſheepe doe waxe more ſtronger.
                     If a yeawe haue then a little lambe, it were better if they did tarrie vnto June, or longer. Some therefore (without doubt) ſaieth, it woulde profite more to couer them ſooner, to the ende that after Harueſt and gathering of fruite, the Lambes féeding all Autumne, ſhall make them ſelues ſtrong againſt Winter doe come, and ſhall better endure the faſting in Winter. For this cauſe it is better to chooſe Autumne than the Spring, as Celſus reporteth by the proofe thereof: for hee ſayeth, it is more méeter for theſe Cattell to bee made ſtrong before Solſtitium, in the midſt of Julie, (which is the longeſt daie in Sommer,) than before Solſtitium in Winter, (which is in the midſt of December.) And among all cattle, theſe may be moſt eaſieſt bred in winter: if the countrey be not verie cold and wet.
                     If ye haue néed to haue many male Rams, Ariſtotle a man of great knowledge of the works of nature, hee commandeth Male lambes. to be obſerued, and to ſpie out the méeteſt time to couple and put the Rammes to the yeaws: as in a drie time when the North winde bloweth. Then (ſaith he,) make the flocke to goe and féede againſt the winde, and putte the Rammes vnto them, and they ſhall haue male lambes, if ye wil haue your yeawes bring female lambes, put the Rams vnto them when the winde bloweth out of the South. And Female lambs. for to haue males likewiſe, they doe vſe to binde the lefte

ſtone downe with a tender band. And to haue females, they binde downe the right ſtone of the Ramme. This is done likewiſe in great Cattell. alſo when your yeawes haue lambde & are ſtrong lambs, the ſhepheard that leadeth them to ſeeke their paſture, it ſhall bee good to leaue behinde all the young Lambes. And thoſe that doe ſucke, are méeter to bee ſolde to the Butcher, than thoſe that haue eaten graſſe, for they are more ſwéeter and delicate fleſhe, and when they are weaned, there commeth more profit by their milke, then when they goe with their Dammes, it is alſo good and profitable to nouriſhe them by the ſides of good townes. For the Cattel of the houſe is more profitable, than ſtrange cattell. Alſo if thy flocke of ſheepe doe faile at anie time through age, or anie other occaſion, thou muſt then To alter thy
                              •
                            flocke. renewe it in keeping the ſtocke, and looking well there vnto, for if thy ſtocke once alter, thou art like to alter tillage.
                     To breede Sheepe, the office of a good ſhephearde is, to nouriſhe as manie head of Cattle yeerely, as there are to breede. ſicke or dead, for yee muſt vnderſtande the Winter, that by vehement and colde weather, it killeth manie ſheepe, the which yee did ſuppoſe they woulde haue outborne the ſayde Winter, which in Autumne they might haue beene taken well. And therefore it is daungerous, without yee furniſhe your ſtocke (from yeere to yeere) with the ſtrongeſt Cattell, and thoſe that ſhall caſilie beare out the after Winter. And he that will followe this: hee ought to to nouriſh ſheepe. nouriſhe no Lambe vnder foure yeeres, nor aboue eight yeeres. For theſe two ages are not ſo good to nouriſhe, nor thoſe which come of olde Cattell, for they followe the age of their Parentes, or els are alwaies barren, wretched and weake. The lambing of young yeawes ought to be looked vnto, as though they had midwiues: for theſe Lambing time Cattell trauelies in Lambing, as well as the woman in childe bearing, and often for ſo muche as they are ignoraunt of the time, they trauell more in the deliueraunce of their Lambes. Wherefore the ſhepheards

ought to haue good knowledge and experience of medicines for theſe cattel, and to help them that haue néed thereof, and to take out the lambe wholly together out of the matrice. For when he lyeth croſſe, hee muſt not bee taken out, but if yee ſee ſhe cannot well bee delivered, yee muſt helpe the yeawe, and take and cutte it in peeces, and ſo take it foorth without hurting the birth or the yeawe. The which the Greekes doe call, an vnperfect medicine, then after when the lambe is taken foorth aliue, yee ſhall raiſe her and ſette her on her feete, And alſo the lambe, and then lette him approche vnto the tettes of the yeawe, and open his mouth and preſſe and make the milke come foorth, that hee maie bee accuſtomed therevnto. But before yee doe this, yee ſhall drawe the yeawe a little, which the heardinen doe call ſtroking, this is the groſſe and thicke milke, which is the firſt milke after her lambing, for if yee drawe not a little thereof, it will ſomewhat annoye the lambe. Then lette him (if hee bee weake) bee ſhutte vppe with his damme the two firſt dayes after hee is lamed, to the ende hee maie be kept warme, and to know the tette and his damme, vntill that hee beginne to leape and waxe more ſtronger: and to putte him in ſome warme cloſe place, then after to putte him with other lambes, becauſe in beeyng alone, hee will waxe leane by too much leaping and playing in his youth. alſo yee muſt aduiſedly putto the young lambes by themſelues, and not with the ſtrongeſt for feare in leaping and tumbling to hurt them, and when they are bigge, yee maie well ſuffer the lambes to goe a fielde with their dammes vntill night, and when they ſhall waxe more ſtronger, then giue them graſſe in their houſes, with the herbe Mellilot, alſo of fine haye or branne: if barley bee good cheape yee maie giue your Lambes of the meale, and of fetches, and when they ſhall waxe yet more ſtronger, yee maie in the middaie remoue them with their dammes into other Paſtures and groundes, and alwaies ſee that your Lambes breake not foorth of your paſtures into other groundes, for then they will alwaie bee ſeeking to haue freſhe paſture.

Although I haue ſpoken of certayne Paſtures, neuer theleſſe yet I will heere ſaie a little of that I haue omitted, Paſture groūd, which is: the beſt and moſt frankeſt graſſe is that which groweth amongeſt errable groundes and furrowes, rather than medowes which are wette or moyſt, and the graſſe in marſhes, and moyſt forreſtes is not good for ſhéepe, nor ſo good Paſture for the feeding of them, and by long vſe and continuance theſe cattell wil waxe wearie & noyſome thereof: if their keeper doe not remedy it in giuing thoſe ſheepe of ſalt with their meate, which ſhal ſaue them and make them to haue an appetite. And in ſommer it ſhalbee good to haue them vnder ſhadowie places, or trees in woodes, to the ende that by their reſting, they ſhall haue the better appetite, when they returne to their Paſture againe, and Drinke, they maie then drinke, whereby to feede the better. And alſo to auoyde their ſurfets. In Winter, ye muſt giue them haie in their rackes and tares, to nouriſhe them withall. They doe alſo feede them with Ealme leaues, and of Aſhe leaues and ſuche like, which is gathered in ſeaſons conuenient, and in Autumne to feed them with haie of the latter ſeaſon. For that is more tender, and more pleaſaunter for them to eate, than other which is dryer, as that which is firſt ripe, the graſſe or herbe called Mellilot, is ſpecial good for them at all times, and likewiſe for all other Cattell. They vſe alſo to haue Fetches for them, which is very good, and to giue them of Barlie ſtrawe ſmallie beaten and ſhort, which is in Winter verie good for them whē they can haue no other meate. Likewiſe of Peaſe holme, is good for them, if they bee kept neere townes or villages: and when the time is to driue them to paſture, or to leade them to drinke in the hotte Sommer, as neede requireth. I will not be of other opinion, but that which Virgill hath written, which is:
                     
                        
                           In the morning tide, leade forth thy yeawes,
                           For to refreſh them, before the ſonne doe riſe:
                           The graſſe being tender, and ſhining with dewiſe,
                           
                              
Soone after commeth drought, is the common guiſe,
                           That after the ſun be once foure houres hie,
                           Then buſhes do cracke, and plaines waxe drie:
                           Then ſingeth the Nightingall, with notes plaine,
                           Driue them to the ſprings of the high mountaine.
                        
                     
                     Alſo in the middaie the ſame Poet ſaith:
                     
                        
                           In heate nowe of the daie,
                           To ſearche it is thy charge,
                           To finde thy Sheepe ſome tree,
                           With branches long and large,
                           To ſhadow them withall,
                           Out of the heate and duſt,
                           As heate and and time doe laſt,
                           Then let them quench their thurſt.
                        
                     
                     And when the great heate is abated, ſoone after let thē be driuen ſoftly to feede. And ſaith:
                     
                        
                           The ſunne nowe being ſette,
                           In the Euening tide,
                           All the daie before,
                           Whereas the grounde hath dride.
                           The night nowe beeing colde,
                           The deawe deſcendeth plaine,
                           On Paſtures dried before,
                           By them refreſht againe,
                        
                     
                     And ye muſt obſerue Aſtrum, which is the ſtar of heate in Sommer, when the Canicular daies doe beginne, to the end that before the middeſt of the daie, Shepheards ought to conduct and driue his ſheep towardes the Weſt, & after the midday is paſt, towardes the Eaſt, for it is a thing of great importaunce, to haue the heade of the ſheepe to feed againſt the Sunne, which often annoyes thoſe Cattell when the rayes of the ſunne beginne to ſhewe on the grounde. And alſo in Winter and ſpring time, yee ought to keepe them cloſe, till the daie haue taken the gellie or netty rime, from Rimes or gellie.
                        
the earth, for in y• tyme the gelly is on the graſſe, which doth ingender (as ſome ſay) the ſcab and a fome at their mouths, & diſtillations from the braine, with heauines of the head, & a looſeneſſe of the bellie. Wherfore in cold & moyſt times, ye néede not obſerue but once a daie.
                     Moreouer, the ſhepheard which doth keep them, ought to be wiſe in gouerning them with gentlenes, as it is commā
                        ded A Shephearde to gouerne. to all keepers of cattel whatſoeuer they be, which ought to ſhew themſelues cōductors and guiders of cattell, and not as maiſters, and to make them goe or to call them, they ought either to crie or whiſtle, and after to ſhewe them the ſheepehooke, but to throw nothing at them, for that doeth feare them, nor yet to ftraie farre of from them, nor to ſitte or lie downe. If he doe not goe, he ought to ſtand, and to ſit very ſeldome. For the office of a ſhepheard is as a high watchman for his cattel, to the end that the ſlow ſheepe doe not ſlip from the other. And on the plaines and meddowes when they make no haſte, then he may ſtaie. But in hard & empty places of Paſture, the light and young ſheepe wil outgo the other, and therefore he ought to haue an eye alwayes amongeſt his ſheepe, or if anie complain by any other means to ſee them incominent remedied, and hee muſt ſee alſo in their paſturing they range not too faſte ouer the groundes, for the light and young ſheepe outgoe the other, and ſtraie abroade in corners, whereby they are in danger the more to be conueyed away, or loſt by ſome other means, or by killing with dogges and ſuch like, theſe rules are common with all cattel. Therefore he that will ſeeme to thriue by thē, he muſt ſee vnto them warily and wiſely from time to time.
                     Ye muſt not meddle them of a ſtrange kind with other of Strange ſheep your flocke, for thoſe being of a ſtrange kinde, they will alwaies ſtand gazing about, and will rather ſeeke to flie then feed: or els looke on others. Therefore looke vnto them, for it is a ſigne they like not the Paſture or layer whereas they gaze, but wil ſeeke anew. Therefore the Shepheard muſt haue a great care, & vſe diligence vnto thē more

than the other. For all beaſtes of wool are more delicate and daintie than others, therefore they ought to haue the leſſe negligence with their keeper or maiſter, for they are of leſſe coueting than other cattell, and yet they cannot abide the heate in Sommer, nor the cold in Winter. Theſe cattel are ſeldome nouriſhed abroad without great danger, but in houſes and cloſed paſtures, and are gluttons and greedy, that if his meate by ſome occaſion is taken away of others, thereby ſometime he wilbe ſick. Therefore ye ought to giue to euery ſheepe, which ſhalbee ſufficient of meate in their rackes for them in Winter, and to giue them in their troughes, of barley and beanes ground together, and alſo dried peaſe, or Akornes ground and giuen with bran, and drie Elme leaues Meate for ſheepe. or others as aforeſaid, or of three leaued graſſe, greene or dry, or of the herbe Mellilot, or haie of the latter ſeaſon and ſuch like. Alſo there is but ſmal profit in ſelling the lambes being young, and leſſe profit in their milke, and they kill thoſe which they cannot wel nouriſh within a while after they he lambde, and thoſe yeawes which haue loſt their lambs, they make them to giue others ſuck, for they make a lambe ſucke to yeawes: and yet cannot draw forth her milke, becauſe her own lambe haue drawn more oftner, & with more ſtrength, & to that lamb which ſhe haue lambd nature in her do ſhew a more loue. But to the other, ſhe is but as a nurſe to a child, and leſſe giuen to nouriſh it, then her owne. Wherefore yee muſt obſerue and ſee to them all the time being but young, and to bee ſuckled of their dammes and other yeawes alſo. In this kinde of Cattell, it were better to nouriſhe and weane more of males then females. Although by cutting and gelding of them by vnſkilfull perſons, manie doe periſh and die thereon, for the females commonlie are of a more ruder wooll, as ſome doe ſaie. And againe before the male lambes be ready to couer the yeawes, they are gelded, and when they are paſt two yeeres, they are killed, and their ſkinnes are more deerer ſolde than anie other, for the beautie of their wooll. In Greece, they vſe to paſture their ſheep where as there is no buſhes or briers, for feare (as I haue

ſaid) that their wooll ſhould not be torne off their bodies: in plaine fieldes a man néede not be ſo carefull. (But here mee thinkes if I ſhould ſée my ſhéepe come with torne fléeſes, I may aſke my ſhepheard where they haue béen, in ſuppoſing their il gouernment, amongſt buſhes and thornes,) therfore he muſt be careful when they be in field, for all the day ſome doe not goe with them. And againe in the houſe hee ought to haue a more greater care in clenſing of them, or any other occaſion not to be foreſlewd, in oft opening their wooll where as any place ſéemes loſe by ſcratches or other waies, and then to tarre it, ſome doe waſh the place with wine and oyle, ſometimes they waſh them all, if the day or time bee not too hote or cold, and doe vſe it ſo in ſome countries thrée times a yeare: and often makes cleane their houſes, & takes away al the moiſture of their vrine, which is eaſie to be done in percing the bordes or plankes with an aulgar, or clenſing the pauements whereas they lye. And not onely to haue a care of their doong, but alſo to kéepe them beaſtes and venomous woormes. Whereupon the Poet Virgil ſaith:
                     
                        
                           Let burne of Cedar odorant,
                           To fume the ſtall or ſtable:
                           To cauſe the ſerpents flie there fro,
                           And voide if thou be able.
                           Whereby thou maiſt them follow,
                           through ſuch perfuming vapour,
                           Of Galbanum the ſmell,
                           Will cauſe them flie full ſure. Waſh ſheepe. In Deuonſhire, they neaer waſhe their ſheepe when they clip, but after waſh the wooll (before they ſpin it) in warme lie, and drieth it on hurdles.
                           
                           Full oft haue it been ſeene,
                           this thing and often prooued:
                           Of litter lying long (they breede)
                           If it be not remooued.
                           The outragious venemous wormes,
                           Be dangerous to touch,
                           Both Snakes and Adders cuſtomed,
                           Doo hide them in their coutch.
                           But now be they once ſeene,
                           
                              
And perfectlie once bare,
                           Full ſoone they flie for feare,
                           To hide them is their care,
                           They flie away full ſoone,
                           In corners of the houſe.
                           They creepe in at a litle hole,
                           As ſwiftly as the mouſe.
                           Take ſtones or ſtaues and kill them,
                           Ere they encreaſe and double,
                           For if they waxe and multiply,
                           Full oft they will thee trouble.
                        
                     
                     If thou canſt without danger of thy houſe, oftentimes burne in the houſe of womens haire, or hartes horne, for the ſauour thereof driueth away all venemous wormes. As for Shearing. the time of ſhéering or clipping, it commeth not in all countries alike. For in ſome countrey it commeth timely, and in other ſome later. The beſt is, to conſider when the ſhéepe cannot endure cold if thou ſhéere him, nor heat if thou ſhéere him not. But at what time ye haue ſhorn, ye ought to noint them with this medicine. That is to ſay, the iuyce of tares Nointing or greaſing. or pulce, luke warme, or of the lées of old wine, and lées of oliues, of each in like portion well mixt togither. And therewithall to rubbe the ſhorne ſhéep. And within thrée or foure daies it wil be conſumed, then if ye be nigh the borders of the ſalt water, they plunge them therein. If not, they do waſh them with raine water kept long and vncouerde, and with ſalt mixt togither and a litle boyld. And this ſhall kéepe them all well that yeare from ſcratching or ſcabbineſſe, as Celſus reporteth, and without doubt the wooll ſhal be more gentler and longer.
                  
                  
                     
                     The remedies and medicines for Sheepe and other cattell.
                     FOr ſo much as I haue carefully written of the diligence which they ought to haue for the preſeruing and keeping their beaſtes in health, now I will declare how to helpe them with medicines, which are grieued with any infirmitie or diſeaſe. Howbeit, although I haue ſpoken alreadie of the moſte part of them, I will yet heere repeate a fewe medicines for great cattell. For as the bodie is of great cattell, ſo is the bodies of the leſſer cattell, almoſt of like nature. Euen ſo, there is ſmal difference betwixt their medicines, and betwixt their diſeaſes, neuertheles, whatſoeuer they are, I will not heere let paſſe or omit.
                     If it chance that all your cattell be ſicke, yee ſhall do as I haue afore commanded of great cattel. (Which I think to Medicines. be a thing neceſſary.) Euen ſo here I command again for a Sicknes or peſtilence. ſingular remedy to change your paſtures, & your watering places, and to driue your cattel into other paſtures far of. If that peſtilence or murreine do come by great heates, ye muſt haue them vnto couertes, ſhades, and colde places. If it come of cold, ye muſt haue them in open places againſt the ſunne. And ye muſt leade them by litle and litle, and not too haſtily, to the end by their ſoft going they be not grieued: nor yet too ſlowly but gently in a meane pace. For euen as they muſt not bee tormented by too much haſte, whiche are alreadie weary, and auoide with this diſeaſe. Euen ſo it is profitable to goe meanely, neither too faſt, nor yet too ſlow: hauing an exerciſe, and not to let them reſt or lye. And when yee haue brought them to the appointed place, yee muſt then parte them into many troopes or bandes, and ſo let them bee looked euer vnto, and beeing ſo parted, they are then in more ſafetie then euer they were before when they were togither, becauſe the ſtrength and the infection of the contagious and

peſtilent ayre is not ſo great in a ſmall troupe of cattell, as in a great. And alſo it is more eaſie to heale a ſmal nomber then a great: therefore ye muſt doe this which I haue commanded, to the end that ye doe not repent the more, when as they fall all ſicke togither. Or if there be any one which hath it, then doe as afore ſaid. Alſo ſhéepe are more tormented with the ſcabbe, then all other cattell, which commonly commeth as the Poet Virgil ſaith:
                     
                        
                           When ſheepe are greatly beaten with raine,
                           Then froſt and cold encreaſeth their paine:
                           Whereby the ſcabbe, will then encreaſe,
                           Which ye may kill, with tarre and freſh greaſe.
                        
                     
                     Or when they begin to haue the itch, yee ſhal annoint him with gooſe greaſe and tar mixt well togither, with the tender crops of broome in may: ſtampt and boild with gooſe greaſe, & put vnto your tar in like porcion. Then make but two ſheads on both ſides his back bone, from his head to the taile, and anoint with the foreſaid greaſe, and ye ſhall néede no more nointing if they be well vſed after, and kept from ſcratches. Alſo after ye haue ſhorne them, if ye doe not remedie them with the remedy and medicine aforeſaid: which is, to waſh them with ſea, or ſalt water, or in a ſalt riuer, and Scabbe. then ſhéere and rub them as aforeſaid, which is good againſt the ſcratches with briers and thornes, which wil otherwiſe grow to ſcabbes. Or if thou putteſt them in a ſtable where horſe haue béen, or lacking of meate, whereby they become leane, which leannes doth cauſe them to haue the itche and ſcab. The which aſſoone as it hath taken them, they neuer ceaſe to ſcratch, bite, or rub the itching places, either with his mouth, féete, or hornes, or to rub againſt a trée, or other thing, which lice may cauſe alſo. If thou ſeeſt any one doe this, then take him, and open and ſhed his wool, and ye ſhall ſée there vnder the ſkin red, and ſcratched, or bitten with his mouth, therfore it muſt be ſodeinly remedied, to the end yt al the reſt be not infected with the ſame. For amongſt all other cattel, ſhéep are moſt therwith tormented: & for ye ſame there be many medicines, the which we ſhall hereafter ſpeake of.

Not that yee can or may vſe all, becauſe that euery countrey cannot haue all, but ſuch as yee may haue ſhall ſuffice.
                     Firſt the compoſition that I haue afore expreſſed, ſhall Medicines for itch. ſerue very well for the moſt part. Alſo if ye ca

                     Some ſhéepheards let them blood vnder the eye, and on the eares. Others lets him blood on the vain vnder the taile, and then bindes of hearbe grace vnto it, beaten with a litle ſalt, and to giue the iuyce of camamile with ale or wine is good. Shéep are alſo tormented in the féete or claw two maner The worme in the claw. of wayes, one is by filth, the other by the worme which bréedes therein. And if the worme doe waxe big, it wil wax ſo ſore that the ſhéepe cannot wel goe but halt. This worme bréeds commonly before, iuſt betwéene the two foreclawes, the head therof is like a tuft of haires growing togither, and

wil ſtick out afore, there is no ſhéep but hath a ſhew of them naturally, but when they are ſmal, they neuer hurt. So whē they begin to grow and waxe great, then there is daunger: which worme is a hollow ſkin and all haire within, which ye ſhal take forth thus, as ſome do teach. Cut it aboue ye foote round, with a ſharpe pointed knife, & ſo beneath, & put your finger in the hollow vnderneath the foote, and your thumbe by it on the top afore, and then thruſt it vp, & with the point of your knife and your thumbe gently take it forth whole, for if ye breake it, it is not good, and then annoint the place with tar, and it wil heale againe ful wel. Alſo others ſaith, it ſtickes before in the midſt of the foote like doges haire, ſtaring byright, and within is the worme all haire.
                     For euery galling in the foote, they heale it with farre Gall in the foot. onely, or with allume and brimſtone mixt togither, or with an vnripe pomgranet, beaten allume, and putting too a litle vinegar, and laid too.

Yet here I wil ſomething ſpeake more thereof, which is, the place in the foote to be cut round, not touching the worme, for feare yee make not an vlcer thereof vncurable, and in danger of cutting of all the ſhéepes féete. When this worme ſhalbe diligently cut round as is afore ſaid, and ſo pluckt foorth whole without breaking any part thereof, if ye doe breake her (they ſay) ſhe caſteth ſuch a venomed poyſon all ouer the place, (except it be ſtraightway medicined) al the foote is in danger to be cut off. And therfore looke wel vnto the taking out therof. Some, whē it is taken out, do no more but drop in the wound ſcalding tallow, or of the dropping of a candel, and ſo letteth it heale. Others do but tarre it.

They haue no other thing but to kéepe them warme, and nouriſh them with Goates milke, the which doeth cauſe it to be more gentle, and doeth mitigate the violentes of the fire, and the burning of the whole flocke, that they dye not thereof. Where Dolus Mendeſius Egyptian, did verie well for to celebrate, which the Gréeks called their monuments and bookes woorthie of memorie, the which were falſely named Democritus bookes. Wherein was for to remedie this diſeaſe, which was, by and by as one ſhéepe had it, (they tooke him,) which griefe comes firſt on the backe of the ſhéepe: and incontinent they make a hole at the entering in of the ſhéepe houſe, and there they bury the infected ſhéepe aliue, with foure féete vpward, and ſo couers him with earth, and all the reſt in comming there ouer, will piſſe theron.

Some ſhepheards do iudge this kinde of ſcabbe, to be a kinde of pocke, which wil commonly be as wel on the briſket, as on his chin: and as they do ſay, it is taken by féeding after hogs, which haue the ſwine pocks, which they do but anoint them with tarre and hogges greaſe melted togither, and ſo they recouer againe, and if they be not holpen in time, one ſhéepe wil infect all the reſt in ſhort ſpace.

And ſome doe let blood vnder the eye. Water in the belly of ſheep wil rot him, which water Water in ſheep. ſome ſhepheards wil cut a hole in his belly and put in a fether, and ſo let out all that water, and then ſtitch it vp againe, and thereby ſome doe eſcape and are well againe.
                     
                        
Some ſhéepe wil haue a turning ſicknes, which is cauſe The worme vnder the horne. of a certaine ſmal worme (as ſome ſhepheards doe ſay) that lieth vnder her horn, which cauſeth them to turne as it were round. If the worme be vnder the right horn, then the ſhéep wil turne on the left ſide, if the worme be in the left horne, ſhe wil turne on the rigght ſide, thus (as they ſay) alwaies contrary. Therefore when any ſhéepe turnes or bowes her head on the left ſide, ye ſhall raſe all round about the right horne, and then ſtrike it off, then tarre it, and ſhe ſhall mend againe.

Then if the ſhepheard can ſpie it, let him take him and rubbe all his head and his eares well, and vnder his eyes. Then with a ſharpe knife cut off both his eares. And let him blood vnder both his eyes. If then he bléede well, hee is like to recouer againe. But if hee bléede litle or nothing, then it were beſt to kil him, and to ſaue his fleſh. For if he die himſelfe (which wilbe ſoone after) his fleſh is naught, and his ſkin wil be redder then others. This blood taketh moſt commonly on ſhéepe that are fat and in good liking.
                     There is in ſhéepe a bladder which wil be vnder the ſkull Bladder in the head. in his head commonly behinde, & when he is troubled therewith, he wil come heauily dragging behind his felows.

Then with the point of your knife, raſe the ſcull finely, but take héede ye touch not the braine, and ſo take and raiſe vp partes of the ſkull, and then yee ſhall ſée a thinne ſkinne or bladder, and therein lies the woormes which are white like otemeale grotes, and are aliue. So take all the bladder whole out: ſo done, lay the ſkin faire and cloſe all ouer thereon againe, and binde thereon eight or nine folde of linnen, and kéepe him warme and cloſe for the ſpace of a fortnight after, & let him take no cold, nor

raine, if he do, he dieth theron, & after xiiii. daies ye may turn him abroad to his fellowes. This diſeaſe cometh moſt vnto yoong ſhéepe, as of two yéeres or vnder, & not vnto old ſhéep.
                     To tag or belt ſhéepe is, when any ſhéepe by running out To tag or belr ſheepe. or neſhenes of his doong doe ray & defile his taile. The ſhepheard ſhal then take ſhéeres and clip the tags away, and caſt dry mould theron. If it then be the hote time of ſommer, it were good to rub it ouer with a litle tar, to kéepe flies away. Alſo ſhepheards ſhould haue a litle board by his fold ſide, to laie his ſhéepe cleane thereon, when he doe dreſſe him, and his tar bottle to hang readie thereby, faſt on a forked ſticke, he ſhould not goe without his dog and his ſhéephooke, knife, ſhéeres, and tar boxe euer with him, or at his folde. Alſo he Dogs for ſhepheards. muſt teach his dogge to barke, when he would haue him to runne. And to run, and to leaue running when he would, or elſe he is no cunning ſhepheard. For to chafe his ſhéepe it is not good: ſome ſaieth, it is a bréeder of the ſcabbe, by chaſing, and then taking ſodeine colde thereon. Therefore hee muſt learne his dogge when hee is a whelpe, for then is beſt, for it is harde to make an olde dogge to ſtoupe. Wherefore let them all be taught when they are yoong.
                     How to perceiue ſhéepe when they waxe and are ſcabby, Scabbe to perceiue in ſheepe. ye ſhall beſt perceiue when they be ſcabby, by the locks of wooll on their backes, hanging looſe, therefore let the ſhepheard viewe and ouerſée his flocke day by day, and ſo hee ſhall ſoone perceiue if any ſheepe doe breake or not.
                     Sheepe wil haue a ſcab, which ſhepheards call the pocks, Pockes of ſheepe. and it wil appeare on the ſkin, like red pimples or purples, and they wil be broad like ſpots as broad as farthings, and there dieth many ſheepe thereof, for lacke of looking too betimes. Therefore to handle often all your ſheepe, and looke all ouer their bodies, and ſee if ye find any ſheep taken therwith: ye ſhal by and by take him from his felows, & put him into ſome freſh paſture. And then ſee & looke daily to the reſt of the flock, and draw them as ye ſhal ſee them infected therwt, & put them in freſh paſtures if they haue it, in ſomer whē
                        
there is no froſtes, then it ſhalbe good to waſh them in water. Remedies alſo. Some do take ye iuice of nightſhade mixt with greaſe, and ther with anoint, or garlick beaten togither with tar, & ſo anoint. Or the iuice of pelitory of ſpain, or of arthichoke, mixt with ſtrong vinegar, and therewith waſh it. Other remedies ſhepheards haue the which I know not, but theſe I thinke ſhalbe ſufficient.
                     There is alſo a ſicknes amōgſt ſhéep, which the ſhepherds cal the wood euil or cramp, which commeth moſt commonly The wood euil or crampe. in the ſpring of the yeare, and taketh them moſt in their legs and in their necks, ſo that it maketh them hold their neckes awry. And the moſt part of ſhéepe that haue this ſickneſſe, within a day or two, thereof wil die, except they haue ſpéedie remedie, which remedie is beſt, to waſh them a litle, and to change their grounds or going, and to bring them to féede in ſome low paſture. For this grief comes commonly to ſhéep, on lay and hilly grounds, and full of fearny grounds. Other remedies there are, which men do vſe to let blood on the vain vnder the eye. Alſo ſome do ſay, that houſe léeke ſtampt with neates féete oyle, and therewith anoint. Or ſcallions, ſtampt and bound to their legges. Other bugloſſe, the leaues ſtampt and bound to their legges.
                     Shéepe in the ſommer wil be troubled with maggets, the fly wil blow vpon ſmal occaſions. To perceiue when any Maggots in ſheepe. ſhéepe is troubled therewith, ye ſhal ſée by her biting, ſtamping, ſtarting, and ſhaking her taile: and there moſt commonly it is moiſt and watry. If it be nigh the hinder partes or taile, it wil be defiled and waxe oftentimes gréene with doonging. Then muſt the ſhepheard clip away all the wooll in that place, to the ſkin: thē to caſt a handful of dry mouldy pouder thereon, (which hee ſhould haue alwaies readie in a bag) to dry vp the moyſture. Then wipe away that mould, and whereas the maggots were, laie tarre thereon all ouer. Thus in the ſommer ye muſt euery day ſée wel vnto them, and marke their féeding and going.
                     For a yaewe that will forſake her lambe aſſoone as it is Yeawes to loue their lambes. yeand, to make her to loue it, ſhepheards dee take the byrth

ſkinne, (which is a thinne Call that the Lambe is lapt in) which they take, or part there of, and lappes it on a lumpe, and puttes it into hir mouth, and make hir to ſwallowe it. If the Yowe will not eate it: then let hir chew it well vppe and downe in hir mouth: and after that, ſhée will loue hir Lambe and be affraide of it, as others. And to make hir to loue another Lambe, if hirs bee deade, they vſe to take hir Lambes ſkinne, and clappe it on the other Lambes body, & then ſhe will loue the other Lambe, & thinke it is hir owne. If a Yowes lambe die in the birth, ſome Shéepheardes doe take the deade lambe, and rubbes another lambe all ouer therewith: and by that meanes the Yowe reſerues it as hir owne, and will loue it aſwell.
                     Shéep oftimes will be poyſoned by eating ſome euil herb Poyſon of ſheepe. or other thinge, where vpon they will ſwell, and ſtagger, in in holding commonlie their heades downe, and within a while after: they will foame at the mouth, and then ſoone after, they will fall downe and die. The remedy is, ſhepheards doe vſe aſſoone as they ſpie any ſhéep réele or ſtagger, they take him and open his mouth and vnder his tongue at the roote, there ſhall yee ſee bladders, which they doe rubbe with the powder of loame, or with croomes of bread, and and breake them, than they piſſe in the ſheepes mouth, and ſo waſheth it downe, If yee cannot piſſe, then ye ſhall take drinke, and powre ſome into his mouth, and ſoone after hée will doe wel againe, or giue him the iuyce of woormewood, with wine, or vinegar.
                     Againſt the time of yeaning as towardes the Spring, ſhepheardes muſt then take good héede vnto their flocke of Yeaning time. yeawes, or any other hauing the gouernment of ſuch cattel. Then muſt the ſhepheardes cheriſh wel their yeawes béeing with lamb, for if the yeawes be not then ſtrong, they will haue no force to deliuer their lambs, which cauſeth many abortiues or dead Lambes, and oft times they cannot be deliuered without helpe. Therefore in that time, good ſhepheardes ought to giue great attendaunce in ſome places where great flockes are, they watche in the nightes as

well as daies, for perhappes three or foure yeawes maie labour to yeane at one time. Wherefore, then the ſhepheard muſt haue helpe, or els they are like to haue loſſe of lambes, and where a yeaws cannot deliuer her Lamb, the ſhepheard muſt helpe her in ſetting his foote on her necke, and with his hands to pluck it from her gently. If it come with the head forward, then it is more eaſie to be taken out. But if the lambe doe come with the rumpe forward, then muſt ye ſhepheard put in his fingers, and put a ſmall corde about the houghes of both the lambes feet, and ſo faſten it and plucke the lambe forth. If any lambe do lie ouerwhart or croſſe, thē muſt the ſhepheard with a ſharp knife cut the lamb in three or foure peeces, and ſo take it forth.
                     Alſo if anie Lambe bee like to die when hee is firſt lambde, yee ſhall open his mouth and blowe therein, Weake lambs new yeaned. and thereby manie haue recouered ſoone after, and done well. Wherefore in this time of the yeare, ye muſt bee painefull to ſee your yeawes and to bee with them late at night, and earelie in the morning, and to ſee and hearken if anie yeawe doe complaine or groane, that yee maye be readie to helpe her, Alſo if any yeaw haue two Lambes and too little milk, thift one lamb as is afore mentioned vnto ſome other yeawe, which hath no lambe, thus ye may do & ſaue in lamming time many Lambes.
                     Things good for the eaſier deliuerance of the lambes, to be miniſtred in time of extremity. Nettles boyled in Malmſey Eaſie deliuerance. and giuen, which wil open the necke of the matrix. Anniſeedes boyled in wine or ale, and giuen. The iuice of Peniryall, ſtamped with ale and giuen.
                     Alſo the iuice of wilde Parſnepes, ſtampt and ſtrained, & giuen. The herbe called Hare wort (in Latin Ariſtolochia) drunk with mirrhe, & pepper, with wine or ale, and giuen.
                     Alſo the leaues of wilde ſage ſtamped and ſtrained with wine or ale, and giuen, or to annoint the matrix with the

                        uice of Wake robin.
                     Alſo Fetches ſtampt with ale and giuen is good alſo. Or mint ſtampt & ſtrained with honied water. Mallow leaues

ſtampt & ſtrained with ale and giuen: or the roote of Lawrel ſtampt & ſtrained with honied water, then warmed & giuen. Al theſe aforeſaid are good to be giuen in order for ye ſpéedier deliuerance of the lambes, when any yeaw is in danger and weake. Shéepe ſometimes wil haue their téeth looſe, for Looſe teeth. that ſome doe let them blood vnder the tayle, & ſome do counſell to chafe their gumnes with the powder of mallow roots burnt, and made into powder, and rub them therwith.
                     Things good to increaſe milke in a yeaw, or thoſe which to increaſe milke. haue ſcant of milke: ye ſhal vſe to giue them fetches, or the herbe Dill to eate, or make the yeawe take the iuice in drinke, or anniſéed beaten and giuen, and to giue them colewoortes is very good. And alſo barley ſodde in water, with Fenell ſeede, and ſo giuen, wil increaſe much milke, and Nigilromana, giuen to eate fiue or ſixe dayes together on mornings faſting. Alſo Radiſh roots ſtampt with ale & giuen, or to giue the iuice of Sowthiſtle. All theſe aforeſaid are verie good to increaſe milke.
                     Of herbs holſome for ſhéep chiefly afore others, Mellilot, ye 
                        Herbs holſom. thrée leaued graſſe, Selfheale, & cinke foile, broome, and pimpernel, white henbane they wil eate: good in ſommer, for it cooleth them. Others there be, but theſe ſhal ſuffice.
                     What times are beſt to weane lambes, in ſome places Weaning lambes. they do neuer ſeparat the lambs from ye yeawes, which (as they ſay) is for 2. cauſes: one thing is, whereas the Rams go with the yeawes it néedeth not, for they wil waxe ſoone dry, ſo wil their lambes be weaned of themſelues. The other cauſe is, whereas they haue no ſeueralles to put their lambes in, when they ſhould be weaned. Wherefore he muſt either ſell them, or let them ſucke ſo long as the dams will giue them leaue, and ſome ſaie tho Lambes ſhall neuer rotte, ſo long as they ſucke their Dammes, except ſhée want meate. For him that hath ſeuerall paſtures, lambes Lambes weaned. would be weaned when they are ſixtéene or eightéene weeks olde, and the better the yeaw ſhal take the Ramme againe, when néede ſhall be. The poore huſbands in many places whereas they vſe to milke their yeawes, doe weane their

lambs being twelue wéekes old, & they do milk their yeaws v. wéeks after & more. But thoſe lambs ſhalbe neuer ſo good as the other that ſucke long, & haue meate enough beſides, which haue bin tried, & proues beſt.
                     A yeawe hauing milk and wil not loue her lamb (as ſome will not,) ye ſhal doe thus, put her into ſome narrow place, To make the yeaw to loue her lambe. ſo y• ſhe can ſcant turne her, and her lambe with her, if ſhée ſmite the lambe with her head, bind her head to the ſide of y• pen, & giue her a litle meat, thē tie a dog by her that ſhee may looke on him, & that will make her to loue her lambe in ſhort ſpace: and otherwiſe to make the yeawe loue her lambe, I haue afore expreſſed.
                     The beſt time to deuide or drawe ſhéepe is, after ye haue ſhorne them, then to put them in partes, as thoſe to deuide or draw ſheep. that yée will féede by themſelues, they ſheare Hogges by them ſelues, and the yeawes by themſelues, the Lambes by themſelues, and the weathers and the Rammes by them ſelues, if ye haue ſo many paſtures for them, or els the great ſheepe will beate the ſmall with their heads, and there maie bée ſome of eche ſort which like not, and are but weake: all ſuch would be put into freſhe paſtures by themſelues, and when they are well amended, then ſel them. And the oft changing of Paſture ſhall amend all kindes of Cattell in ſhorter time than to remaine long in one Paſture. Alſo the Foldes for ſheepe. folding of ſhéepe, which they in ſome places doe ſet their fold with diuers partitions, and points the weathers, y• yeaws, & the lambs ech by themſelues, ſome ſhepheardes tie dogge at the foure corners of the fold. Some drailes his dogges about the folde a pretie waie of. Others ſette vp ſhewes of dead Dogges heads, which is to feare anie wilde beaſt in comming to the foldde. In ſome places the ſhephearde hath his Cabbine going on whéeles, to remoue here and there at his pleaſure: ſhepheards néed not greatly care for folding but once in ye yere, which is frō Iuly, til after Auguſt, except dry coūtries, for they are neuer lightlie folded in Autumne nor winter, for in rainie weather they counſel not to fold, but to ſticke ſtakes about on the landes, and thereby the ſhéepe

wil ſit downe by them. Whereby they ſhal haue more room than beyng together in the fold, and ſhepheardes ſaie it is not good folding of ſheepe in any rany weather.
                     And alſo to make your Pennes neere the fielde or Paſture ſide in ſome drye growne, and make alſo partitions thereinto receyue ſmall tropes of forty or moe, with gates vnto them, that when ye haue drawn them, yee may faſten eche gate by himſelfe, and there the ſhepheard maye turne them, and looke if any of them be faultie in any other cauſe, & therein to amend them. For if his pen be made in partes, he may take and deuide them at his pleaſure, and when he hath taken ſo manie as hee ſhall ſeeme needfull, he maie turne all the reſt to paſture. And thoſe which are in the Penne, he may vſe as he ſhal ſeeme good, this ſhall ſuffice for your penfoldes,
                     To put the Ramme vnto the yeawes, if all men do at To put the Rammes to yeawes, one time is not the beſt, for then there will loſſe followe. For him that hath the beſt Winter Paſture, or a timely Spring in the yeere, he may ſuffer the rammes to go with the yeawes all the yeere to couer when they wil. But in cō
                        mon Paſtures, the Rams are commonly put to the yeawes about holy Roode time: for then (they ſaye,) the Ramme would goe with the bucke, to haue them come more timely, but the common huſbandman may not ſo doe, becauſe hee hath no paſture but the common fieldes: for him to put the Ramme to the yeawes it ſhalbe beſt at Michaelmas. And for ſuche poore huſbandes as dwell among mountaines and hilles, hauing neither paſture nor common fieldes, but mountaines and heathes, it were better for them to putte the Ramm about Simon & Iudes day, for becauſe, a yeawe goeth with lambe xx. weekes, then if ſhee lambe too ſoone or timely in the ſpring, hauing no new graſſe, ſhe may not giue her lambe milke, and for want thereof, many lambs are loſt, A yeaw with lambe. & the yeawes then being poore, & hauing no milke, they will often forſake their lambes, that in hard countries oft times they die, both the yeaws and lambs: therfore herein, let euery man do as he thinkes beſt.
                     
                        
There is alſo in the Spring a diſeaſe commeth to manie lambes, which commonly are of 10. or 14. daies olde, and is The leafe in lambes. much in laie paſtures, which diſeaſe y• ſhepherds cal, y• leaſe becauſe (as they ſay) they wil féed moſt cōmonly on leaues, & chiefly in Oke or the hauthorne leafe, & ſoone after they will reele and ſtagger, and fome at the mouth, then they will fall downe and ſo die, whereof I haue aſked manie ſhepheards, and they know no remedie for it. Wherefore me thinkes it ſhould ſeeme good to trie if the diſeaſe do come by anie poiſoned thing. Then to giue thē ſuch things as wil deſerue poyſon, as to giue the lambe ſome Treacle in warme milke, or ſouthernwood ſtamped and giuen with ale, or the iuice of Aron, called cuckoſpit, ſtampt & ſtrained in honied water, & giuen warme, or the root of the great bur bruiſed & ſod in wine & then giuen. All theſe are good againſt poiſoned cauſes. But if this diſeaſe breede firſt in the head, then ſhall yee miniſter thinges chieflie to purge the head, as the tender buds of Bearefoote beaten, and the iuice mixed with wine & giuen. Alſo the iuice of Sowbread, (in Latin, Panis porcinus,) the which iuice ye ſhal put into his noſtrils, and let it diſtill into his head. The which wil purge both bis head and brain. Likewiſe the iuice of garden creſſes ſtamped and ſtrained, and giuen with wine doe alſo purge the head. But if the ſayde diſeaſe come of the Hawthorne or Oake leafe onelie, which leaues be of a harde digeſtion, and perhappes maie cauſe this diſeaſe, if it ſhould be ſo. Then boyle Southernwood in wine, and giue thereof to the ſicke Lambes, or wilde mallowes ſodde in wine and giuen. Or the herbe Cuckoſpit boiled in wine and giuen. Alſo of Iuniper ſeeds or leaues ſtamped, then ſtrained and giuen with wine. Alſo Penniryall ſtamped and ſtrained with wine or Ale and ſo giuen. All theſe aboue ſayde are good to make digeſtion, and other wayes holeſome for the Beaſt. Thus muche I thought meete to write, concerning the remedies for this ſtrange diſeaſe in Lambes. Let Shepheardes thereof trie ſo farre as they ſhall thinke good.

But whenſoeuer anie Againſt looſe teeth. of the ſheepe haue looſe teeth, yee ſhall take the tender croppes of briers, called Blacke brier, and putte thereof among his meate, and ſo they will faſten againe in eating thereof. It is good for al men to vnderſtand, ſpecially Shepheards, which things do hurt or rotte ſheepe, wherby they Rotters of ſheepe. maie auoide the danger the better, ye ſhal vnderſtand there is a graſſe or weed, called Speare woort, the leaues are long and narrow like the point of a ſpeare, hard and thicke, the ſteales hollowe, growing a foote and more high, with a yealow floure, which is cōmonly in wet places, and there wil it grow moſt, or where water haue ſtood in the winter. There is alſo another weed called Peniwort or penie graſſe, it wil cōmonly grow in moiſt & marriſh groūds, & it groweth low by the ground, & hath a leafe on both ſides the ſtalke like vnto a penie, thick & round, & without floure, yet ſome, doe ſaie it beareth a yealow floure, which wil (as they ſay) kil ſheep if they eate it.

Alſo knottegraſſe is not good for ſheep, (for as ſome doe ſay) it wil cauſe them to fome at the mouth & ſo wilbe a ſcab. Likewiſe al mildeawd graſſe is not good, the which ye ſhal know two maner of waie. The one is by the leaues on trees in ye mornings, & chiefly on ye Oake tree. If ye licke the leaues, yee ſhal finde a taſte thereon like honie, wherby the mildewde graſſe wil kil many ſheep, & rimes on the ground, then if the ſhepheard do wel, hee ſhoulde not let them go abroad, til the ſunne haue dried vp all thoſe dewes. Euill water is likewiſe not good, and a hunger rot is the woorſt rotte of all. For therein is neyther good fleſhe nor ſkinne, and being hunger ſtraued, they eat ſuch as they can come by. But in paſtures they ſeldō haue ye rot, but hurt with mildeawes, yet then they wil haue much tallow,

and likewiſe fleſhe, and alſo a good ſkinne. They ſay little white ſnailes be yll for ſheepe, other in paſtures or fieldes, there is a rot called the pellet rot, which commeth of greate wet, ſpecially in wood grounds or fallow fieldes, where they cannot wel drie them. Al theſe are the chiefe things that do rot ſheepe, as the ſhepheards haue found commonly by experience from time to time.
                     Certayne preceptes taken foorth of Ariſtotle, libro de natura animalis. When the teeth bee all euen of a ſheep, Ariſtotles precepts. it is a ſigne that the ſheepe is olde, yet thereto ſome ſhepheardes doe ſaye, it is ſo in a young ſheepe as well as in the olde, and that is according to the Paſture or grounds they feede in. If they feede in harde grounde theyr teeth will weare the ſooner, than in a ſofte grounde or Paſture
                     If ye wil haue your lambes come in the ſpring time, put the Ram to the yeawes in the mids of October, if ye wil Lambes. haue them come in Winter, ye muſt put the Rams to the yeawes in Iuly.
                     The yeawe goeth with her lambe flue monethes, yee ſhall marke when a yeawe doth commonly bleate beyng Lamming time. great with lambe, then iudge that her lamming time is neere.

                     Stony and marriſh grounde is not holeſome for ſheepe, and wood ground is not very hurtful.
                     In Sommer, ſheep ought to bee fed in the morning before the heat of the day, and to let them drinke faire water of the Spring. Alſo in the Spring time, and Winter, put not forth your ſheep before the deawes and froſt be gone, for that graſſe which hath deawe or froſt, breedeth a diſeaſe or ſcabbe.
                     It is good alſo to put your ſheep in the harueſt in ſtubble

ground, for they will dung well the landes. Note alſo, if a ground be wet with raine, it ſhall not be good to let them lye theron, but ſtur them to ſome higher place.
                     Againe in the moneth of Aprill maie, Iune, and Iulie, not then to eate much, but in Auguſt, Octobre, Nouember, and December, then to eate well after the dewe is gone, the better to withſtand the ſtormes in winter.
                     Note alſo that the waſhing of ſhéepe with ſalted raine water after he is ſhorne, will ſaue him from the itch, and breaking of the wool, and from being ſcabbie: note that putting the ramme to the yowes when the wind is in the north will cauſe them bring males, and putting the ramme to the yowes when the wind is in the ſouth, will cauſe the yowes bring female lambs. And thoſe yowes that do drinke ſalte water, do deſire the ramme the ſooner, but ye muſt not ſalte the water before the ramming time, but after: ſome ſay, two good rammes to a hundreth yowes is ſufficient, and ſome thinke the more rammes the ſooner ſpéede: but they will ſerue.
                     Note alſo, all thinges will fatte ſhéepe which is mingled with ſalte water, as fetches, branne, chaffe and ſuch like. Much ſturring of ſhéepe doth make them leane. There is a diſeaſe in ſhéepe which is called the ſpring, it cometh with a ſwelling in the belly, and foming at the mouth, and ſodainly the ſhéepe will fall downe in the way. The remedy is: Take a quantitie of rue, and another of roſemarie, and boyle them in milke, or in new ale, for that is the better, and when it is a little boilde, then ſtampe it, and then ſtraine it, and ſo giue it milke warme vnto the ſhéepe: but before yee giue it, pricke him vnder the tongue and make it bléede if ye can, and he ſhal do wel.
                     There is alſo oftentimes a giddines in ſheepe, which doth take them in their heads, (as ſhepheards do iudge,) if it bee the bladder ye ſhall find it ſoft vnder your finger, and there ye muſt cut it as is afore ſaid: or the worme vnder the horne which is likewiſe afore declared. For any other paine or giddines, theſe are ſpecial good. Take the iuice of iuie leaues

and put thereof into his eare, and bind it faſt for caſting out. Or the iuice of cackcoſpit in like caſe warme. Or the iuice of hegtaper cald foxe gloue, put it into the eare.

                     For the worme in the guts.
                     SOme ſhéep wil haue a long worme in his guts, and alſo

The remedy: take a quantitie of ye iuice of horehound, wt ſome léeke blades albruſed, & ſo giue it. Or to giue him the powder of wormeſéed in ſome malueſie. Alſo the powder of ſauin finely beaten and giuen in wine or ale.
                     Shéep ſometimes wilbe lowſie, and haue lice like hog lice, which breed ſometimes by much wet, ſometimes by hunger To kill lice. and pouerty, and ſometimes they may haue lice in lying among hogs, and then ye ſhal ſée them rubbing & ſcratching wt their hornes and ſo wil teare their wooll in many places. The remedy: take quickſiluer kilde in oile oliue, or ſpettle & therwith annoint your ſheep: or ye pouder of white ellebory, and mixe it with ſallet oile, and therwith annoint. Or boile it in vinegar, and waſh the ſhéep therewith. Or take ye powder of ſtaueſaker and mixe it with oile oliue & annoint therwith: Or ye may take freſh greaſe, ſope, tar, & melt together, & therwith annoint. Al theſe afore ſaid are good againſt ſhéep yt are lowſie.
                     
                        
There is ſometime on the end of the yowed tets a certaine ſmal mote or ſcab with a black head, hanging vnto it a hard ſtopping the tets. mattry ſtring like flegme, which is within the tet, and it wil ſlop her milke, that of ſome yow the lambe can draw no milke. Wherefore the ſhepheard muſt ſée to al ſuch things in tamming time, or els ſome lambs are like to ſtarue.
                     Some ſhepheards ſay, yt a horned ram is il to get lambs, for ye yowes are at lamming time in more danger of deliuerance, becauſe ye lambs haue long ſtubbed hornes before they are lambd: wherby in the lambing time they put the yowes in more danger, therfore the net ram is counted more better.
                     Some ſhéep wil haue a water bladder vnder their chin, Water bladder in ſheepe. which ye ſhall féele to be ſoft, which wil breed in moiſt times of winter by féeding on moiſt places: ſhepheards haue no other common remedy but to launce it a little and then to tar it. There be ſome lambs their peſill is clouen, I can learne no remedy but kéepe it cleane til he be big, and annoint it wt tar, and then to kil him, for he wil die at the length. Clo ueu pefill.
                     
                     How for to know the age of a ſhéep, ſhe being of one ſhere ſhe wil haue two broad téethafore, at the ſecond ſhere, ſhee will haue iiii. broad teeth afore: at the third ſhere, ſhe will haue vi. broad téeth afore, and at the fourth ſhere, ſhee will haue viii. broad teeth afore, and thus ye may know the age of all ſheepe by their teeth.
                     Sheep are cald (ouis in latin) which word cometh of ſacrificing in the old time: The ſheep is a beaſt good & profitable for many cōmodities for the vſe of a man, as commōly is known among all men in this countrie and others. If the rams be put vnto the yowes when the winde is in the north, the yowes will bring males, and if the winde be in the ſouth, if the yowes he then couered, they will bee female lambs. Alſo ſuch a colour as the vaine is vnder the rammes tongue, of ſuch colour ſhal the lambe be when he is lambde: and when old ſheepe are moued to generation in vnordinate times (ſhepheards ſay) it is a good ſigne: And if young ſheep be ſo moued (they ſay) it is a taken of ſome generall peſtilēce among them that yeare following.
                     
                        
Alſo Ariſtotle ſaith, ſhéepe do commonly conceiue in drinking-water, and therefore ſome ſhepheards do giue them ſalt, and do force them to take it, which doth cauſe them to conceiue the rather, and ſalt will kéepe them longer ſafe and ſound without ſickenes. They do alſo giue them in harueſt Cucurbitas, and ſuch hearbes with ſalt, which will increaſe much milke in their vdderns. If your ſheepe be made to faſt three daies and then giue them meat, they will ſoone after waxe fat: in ſommer cold water coming out of the north ſpringes is good for them to drinke: and in harueſt, warme water coming out of the ſouth ſhall be good for them, and then to eate in the later part of the day or night is alſo good for ſheepe. And thoſe ſheepe which are driuen and trauell farre, do ſoone waxe leane, and ſhepheards wil perceiue thoſe that will beſt endure out the next winter folowing, for ſome ſheepe are ſo feeble they are not able to ſhake of the iſe from their backes, and ſome will ſuffer none thereon but ſtill ſhake it off. The ſheepe which be nouriſhed in watry places their fleſh is not ſo holeſome as others nouriſhed in drye groundes, and thoſe foure footed beaſts nouriſhed in moyſts groundes with long tailes, may worſe awaye with winter then thoſe with broad tailes.
                     Alſo ſheepe with ſmal and thin ſhort wooll on their tailes may worſt away with winter: ſhepheards ſay, the wooll of a ſheepe that is wirried with the wolfe or eate, thereof, it is infected, and the cloth made of that wooll wilbe lowzy.
                     Sheepe alſo are of leſſe ſtoutnes of nature, and wit, then other foure footed beaſts. The thunder feareth ſheepe greatly, ſpecially if one be alone. If thunder happen in the euening, or night, it is daungerous to make yowes to caſt their lambes, or if any be alone. Therefore it ſhall bee a good remedy to bring them all into one flocke. Acornes are ill for ſheepe, and make yowes to caſt their lambs.
                     Some ſhepheards ſay, to ſhere ſheepe not afore midſomer, is good to make them haue a long ſtaple, for in hotte weather the wooll of ſheepes backes doth grow moſt.
                     In folding of ſheepe, the opinion of ſome huſbands holde,

that the piſſe of ſhéepe doth heat, helpe, and comfort the land as much or rather more then doth their dung: therefore ſome do will their ſeruants or ſhepheards to raiſe all the ſhéepe in the fold before they let thē forth in winter once euery night, and to go about the ſides of the fold with a dogge, for commonly when as ſhéepe do ſée anie dogge come nie them, they will then dung and piſſe, and when they haue ſo done, ye may let them out of the fold, and this order is very good for your lands.
                     Againſt the rot, if you feare your ſhéepe, in wet times, ye ſhal put them into a houſe thrée daies and thrée nights without meat or drinke: then giue to euery hundreth one buſhel of bran mixt with ſo much ſalt laid in troffes, & hunger will make them to eate it, then driue them to the water, and let them drinke their fill. Then let them be chaſt with a curre a good ſpace after, and put them then into what ground yee will for one quarter, and they ſhall take no hurt: then muſt you take them vp the next quarter and ſerue them ſo again. Thus muſt ye vſe them iiii. times in the yeare in doubtfull times, if ye will ſaue your ſhéepe from the rot.
                     Some ſhepheards do vſe when they feare the rot, to take them vp and to giue ech ſhéepe hee ſuſpecteth, a little milke mixt with ſalt, and to ſet water by them, and to kéepe them ſo for certain daies, which is thought a good way to preſerue them if they be taken in time.
                     Some ſhepheards do giue his ſhéep the iuice of elder mixt with honied water or milke giuen warme a little, which wil purge water forth of their bodies, or iii. drams of the iuice of ſpurge, in a pint of honied water, to giue a quantitie thereof. Alſo plantaine ſod in water mixt with ſome milke and giuen, do purge water betwixt the fleſh and the ſkinne. Thus much concerning the rot and water in ſhéepe. Alſo if ſheepe be chaſt or driuen a iourney, if then they will drinke ſalte water, it is a ſigne they are ſound, and wil do wel.
                  
                  
                     
                     A good medicine for the ſtagger in lambs, or young ſheepe.

                        des, of hempſéeds, and of honie, of each a peniworth. Then beate all theſe together, then put thereto a pottell full of new milke, and ſturre the honie and it with the reſt all together, and thereof giue each lambe or ſheepe two ſponefuls or ſomewhat more thereof milke warme. And this will ſaue them for that yeare. This muſt bee giuen in the beginning of May.
                  
                  
                     To helpe ſheepe that haue the poxe.
                     YE ſhall pricke the vayne vnder the tayle nigh the rumpe, and let them bleede, and likewiſe pricke the vaine vnder the right eye, and let them bleed. Then take ſtrong vinegar as ye can get, and put to ſo much ſalte as ye maie make it like a brine, and milke warme giue euerye ſheepe three good ſponefuls thereof. Uſe this twiſe or thriſe betweene two or three daies, and it wil helpe. But as ſoone as you ſhall ſée any ſheepe infected put him from the reſt, and then giue him this drinke aforeſaid. The poxe will commonly begin vnder the briſket, and ſo on the rumpe, and then it will meete in ſhort time, and ſo periſh.
                  
                  
                     For the itch or ſcabbe in ſheepe.
                     YE ſhal boile the hearbe bearefoot in water, with the roots of camelion noir, which is the great thiſtle that hath milke, and waſh the ſcabby places therewith warme, and it will helpe them: often proued.
                  
                  
                     
                     Cutting or gelding lambs.
                     THe age of cutting and gelding of young lambs (as ſome ſhepheards ſay) is beſt in the wane of the moone, the ſigne and the houre being good, young lambs from three dayes olde till nine dayes olde, for then they are young and tender and maye eaſily be gelt. Yet ſome other do hold, it is better cutting of lambs when they are more ſtronger, as of three weekes olde or more. But then is more danger in cutting them. For if they be then ranke of bloud (as ſome will be more then other ſome) then the bloud often will fall into the codde, raines and belly, and there it will lye and cauſe the lambs ſoone after they are cut to die. Therefore put the fine powder of rozen into his codde, and that will drie vp the quarie bloud.
                     Therefore ſome do chooſe out thoſe lambs that bee luſtie and fayre, and cuts their eares, or lets them bloud the daye before.
                     Some ſhuts them in a houſe the night before without meat, and then to cut them. Alſo a good ſure way is this: ye ſhall cauſe one to hold the lambe betwixt his legs, or on his lappe, and turne the lambe on his backe, in holding his foure feete vp right together: But if ye ſhall ſee blacke ſpots in his 
                           〈…〉
                        ankes then cut him not, for he will die, for he is rank of bloud. Then let the cutter take and holde the tippe of the codde in his left hand, and with a ſharpe knife cutte the top thereof an inch long cleane away.
                     Then with his thumbes and his two formoſt fingers on both handes ſlippe ſoftely downe the codde ouer the ſtones to his belly, and then with his teeth holeyng the left ſtone whole in his mouth, drawe it ſoftlye forth ſo longe as the ſtring is: So done, then drawe foorth the other in like maner. Then ſpytte in the codde, ano annoint his flankes on both ſides of the codde with freſh greaſe, and ſo let him or them go.
                     
                        
But if ye draw the ſtones raſhly (as ſome will) not holding downe his cod with their hands, as afore ſaid, and ſuffers the lambe to ſtruggle, whereby it may ſoone breake the ſtring of a vaine in drawing the ſtones, which will then gather to lumps of bloud in his belly and codde, and thereof die within two or thrée houres after: And when ye haue cut them lette them not lye, but ſturre them vp and downe after for two or three houres. For the lambes to reſt ſodainely after cutting, is not good, nor yet to bee put forth ſodainely in colde windes or wet weather. Thus much for the cutting & gelding of lambs.
                  
                  
                     For a ſheepe that hath loſt her quide.
                     IF a ſheep haue loſt her quide, notwithſtanding, ſheep will eate all the day, and caſt it vp at night againe, (which caſting wilbe like to the panch of a beaſt:) for he cannot digeſt it, and thereby they neuer proſper, but pine away at length by little and little. The cure. Ye ſhall take quide woort, (which groweth among corne, like grounſell,) and bruſe thereof a quantitite, then marke when ye ſée another ſhéepe chew her quide, take her, and take part of he quide out of her mouth, and mixe it with the bruſed quidewoort, and role it in a little ball, and ſo giue it, and make her to ſwallow it, and he ſhal do wel.
                  
                  
                     The red water.
                     SHéepe oftentimes will haue the red water, which as ſhepheards ſay, is a certaine bladder with water vnder the tip of his heart, which water ſcaldes and conſumes the heart, ſo at length he will die: a good way to helpe is, euery night before they reſt, do ye chaſe them a little with a dog which will preſerue them from the ſaid water.
                  
                  
                     
                     Againſt the gall.
                     A Sheepe when he is troubled with flowing of the gall, yee ſhall ſee him ſtand ſhrinking with his four feet nigh together. Then giue him halfe a ſponefull of aquauite mixt mith ſo much vinegar, and let him bloud vnder the taile, and hee ſhall mend: and it is good againſt the red water alſo.
                  
                  
                     Hearbes euil for ſheepe.
                     HEarbes, if ſhéepe eate thereof, as ſpere woort, which groweth commōly in moiſt places, and beareth a yellow flower, and hath leaues like ſpeare points, thicke and hard to digeſt. Alſo blacke elleborie, will kill ſheepe or other cattel if they eate any quantitie thereof. There is an other hearb cald two peny graſſe, which growes in medowes, which is as euil for ſhéep as ſpeare wort. Againe oke leaues, if ſhéep eate thereof gréene, it is euil for them, ſpecially for young lambs, which wil kil them: and alſo yeugh leaues, if they eat therof, it wil go nigh to kil them: and likewiſe of other cattel. And dead graſſe or rotten fog in low commons and paſtures, is euil for ſhéep, and wil bréed a rot in them: and hemlocke, and muſhromps is il for ſhéep, and white ſnailes. Thus much here, of euil hearbs for ſhéep, wherof I haue recited part before.
                  
                  
                     To helpe hoggerels if they miſlike.
                     IF young tegges or hoggerels vnder a yeare olde, do not like, ye ſhal make tar warme, giue vnto each a ſponefull thereof, and it will helpe: but if they be with lambe it is not good for them.
                  
                  
                     The turning diſeaſe in ſheepe.
                     THere is a turning diſeaſe in ſheep, which cauſeth thē to hold their heads on the one ſide: ſome ſhepheards do

counſell. If ſhe hold her head on the right ſide, ye ſhall ſtrike of the horne on the left ſide of. For vnder ye horne there lies a worme, which ye ſhal annoint with tar, and that wil kil it: then bind a cloth theron, and ſo it wil do wel againe.
                  
                  
                     The tyne worme.
                     THe tine worme is a ſinal red worme, with many legges, much like a hog louſe, and they will creepe in graſſe: if ſhéepe or other cattell do eate one, they will 
                           •
                        well, and within a daie die, if he be not remedied. To remedy him ye ſhall take ſtale & ſalt a quantitie, and ſtur them together, and giue it ſo, and chafe him a while after: or giue him the iuice of hearbe Robart with ale, and he wil mend.
                  
                  
                     To helpe the wethering in a yowe.
                     STampe the leaues of mallowes with ſtrong ale and giue it: or take & ſtampe hearbe grace and ſtraine it with good ale and giue the yowe iii. or iiii. ſponefull thereof, and ſhe ſhal do wel. And the iuice of mugwoort will do the like.
                  
                  
                     Goates with their nature and feeding.
                     FOr ſo much as I haue written ſufficiently of ſhéep, I wil now here ſpeake ſomewhat of goats, which are cattell much deſired of in many places.
                     Theſe kind of cattell deſire to haue buſhes and bryers, and alio thornes, and other trées, rather thē to haue plaine paſture groundes or fields. For they féede as well in rough and rude groundes as plaine places. For they feare neither bryer, rocke nor thorne, buſh or other woode, and they loue very well low and ſmall trees, ſhrubbes, as alſo wild trées, crabtrées and ſuch like, or the wild graſſe mellilot: alſo of willowes and young okes, or elmes being not hie.
                     
                        
The buckes haue vnder their iawes two wattles or tufts like a beard, which is the better to be eſtéemed of, his body alſo being large withall, and his legs great, his necke playne and ſhort, with great hanging eares: his head ſmall, his haire blacke and thicke, cleane and long withall. In many places they dod ſhere them to make mantils for ſouldiours. Alſo the bucke goat when he is of ſeuen moneths olde, he is ſufficient to couple and to couer the females.
                     For he is of ſo great a heat, and ſo knauiſh withall, that Goat bucke waxe ſoone old. he will not ſpare to couer his owne damme, though ſhe bee yet milch. Through the which heat he waxeth ſoone olde, and before he be vi. yeares he is nie ſpent. For his youthfull yeares being ſo hot: hath conſumed his ſtrength. Wherefore after v yeares he is not ſufficient to couer the females. The ſhe goat which doth reſemble the bucke afore mentioned, is greatly to be prayſed, if ſhe haue great tets with large vddurns and full of milke. In temperate countries they chooſe the goates which are without hornes. But in countries windy and ſtormie which is ſubiect often vnto great windes, they take thoſe which haue hornes: but in moſt places ye ſhall ſée that the buckes haue no hornes, becauſe they are moſt vnhappy in puſhing and goring with their hornes, which thing is often dangerous.
                     Theſe cattell ought not to be aboue one hundreth in a heard: although that ſhéepe with wooll may bee a thouſand together in a flocke. And alſo when ye buy goates, it is better to buy all together out of one companie or heard, then to chooſe in diuers partes or companyes, to the ende that when yee woulde lead them to paſture, they doo not ſeparate them ſelues into diuers partes: and alſo it will bee the better for them to agree in their houſes. And too great a heat in ſommer doth annoye theſe cattell verye much, yet more doth the cold in winter: for theſe female goats which do bring forth a kidde in winter, through the cold and vehemē
                        cie thereof, it often maketh them bring forth abortiues and dead kids.
                     
                        
Alſo abortiues comes when they giue thē in ſome place nothing but acorns for their meat. Wherefore ye muſt not giue them but a quantitie at once thereof.
                     The chiefeſt time to haue them coupled or couered with the bucke, is in Autumne, before the moneth of December, to the ende that againſt the graſſe and leafe do ſpring freſh and tender, then ſhee ſhall kidde and bring forth their young the better, whereby to haue more graſſe, and therby to giue the more milke.
                     Alſo their houſes ought to be paued with ſtone, or elſe naturally to be of grauell of it ſelfe all vnder, for theſe kind of cattell bee ſo hot they muſt haue no litter vnder them. But their kéeper to looke alwaies diligentlye vnto them, in clenſing them daylye in their houſes, and in their ſaid houſes not to ſuffer anye fylthye dung, or other moiſture to remayne, or anye other dunghill: For it is cleane contrarie againſt the nature of goates. If the yowes bee of a good kinde, they will bring two kiddes a péece, and ſome times three at once: Which is not good nor yet commended when a goat ſo doth. And alſo being of two yeares, to bring at once three kiddes. If ſo then ye muſt nouriſh the kiddes as ye do the lambes, hauing but ſmall ſuccor. But the young buckes muſt bee a little more corrected and kept lowe, to abate their heat and laſciniouſnes in them. But the other ye muſt giue them aboundance of milke, and alſo to giue them Elme leaues and ſéedes, and of mellylot hearbe, and of iuie, or the tender croppes of lentil peaſe, or other tender branches and crops. Alſo when a goate hath kydded, yee ſhall reſerue the moſt fayreſt and ſtrongeſt of the two: (If that ſhe haue two at a birth.) For to repleniſh alwaies your heard, the other yee may ſell if yee will, or other waies diſpoſe him. Yee ſhall not giue any kidde to a goat of a yeare, or two yeares to nouriſh, for thoſe kiddes which they bring within thoſe ſaid times, ought not to be nouriſhed or kept, except they bee of three yeares, and thoſe which be but a yeare hauing a kidde, it

ought ſodainely to be taken away from the damme.
                     But thoſe goats which haue kiddes being of two yeares, ye ſhall let them remaine till they be ready to ſell. And ye muſt not keepe your doaes no lenger then viii. yeares, becauſe they being ſore weakened in ſo often bearing, they will become barren. Alſo their kéeper ought to be rough vnto them, in giuing them ſharpe words, and to be diligent, patient, not angry, and yet bold: For to go with them through valleis, on rockes, and deſart places, through buſhes, ſhrubbes, and ſuch like, and yet not alwayes to follow his heard, as the kéepers of other cattell. But he ought to bee alwaies before this cattell. And to bee more carefull of them then of any other cattell. For theſe in féeding and brouſing or paſtoring doo alwayes obey the buckes, in deſcending and giuing them place, and therefore they muſt bee looked vnto when ſome doo ſitte, looke the other runne not here and there: But ſee that they reſt peaceably and gently all at their owne eaſe, to the ende the yowes hauing the greateſt tettes and vddurns, do not thereby waxe leane or other wayes become euill or ſicke.
                     The goates are nouriſhed almoſt of nothing chargeable. Yet they brouſe and féed wholly together as the ſhéepe, and doe clime vp on mountaines againſt the heate of the ſunne, with greater force then the ſheepe, and they bee of more greater trauell and exerciſe, and are more in ſtrength and ſtouter of nature. Wherfore our aunceſtours did vſe them as they do yet in mountaynes, and wilde places, which is counted moſt meeteſt for them: And to haue their houſes and gouernment as the ſheepe haue, in putting the buckes apart, as they do the rammes: For they are in all thinges gouerned as the ſhéep, and are much conuerſant with ſheepe, in howſing and paſturing alike.
                     But theſe kind of beaſtes are not ſo meete to bee about houſes as ſheepe, for they are more hurtfull vnto all maner of hearbes and bees: therefore they are more meeter to bee in rougher and barren groundes, as buſhes, rockes, mountaines,

and ſuch. And ſome thinke it good not to haue in a troupe or head aboue fiftie goates, becauſe they will be ranging here and there, and are fooliſh cattell and without care, ſoone hanged here and there, which are in more danger then the ſheep: therefore it is more painfuller vnto their kéeper, and not to let them go in cold places, for cold is moſt hurtful vnto them.
                  
                  
                     Of their diſeaſes.
                     AS it doth happen to other kindes of cattell to haue the peſtilence Of diſeaſes in goates, as peſtilence and ſuch like. or murren and ſuch: and ſometimes ſicke of other diſeaſes, in waxing leane through paine thereof: alſo the goates, although they be fat and in good liking, ſo much the ſooner will they haue the peſtilence, and be caſt downe all at once, and die throughout al the heard except ye diuide them, and when it ſo happeneth vnto them, it is chiefely by the aboundance of paſture or féeding. Now when ſoeuer ye ſhall ſée one or two ſo taken with this diſeaſe, yee muſt let all the reſt bloud incontinent, and ye ſhall not let them féed all the day, but four houres, and kéepe them ſhut cloſe in a pen, or ſuch like thing: To ſée if any other do become ſicke of the ſame or any other griefe, the which ſhall be méet to giue thē of ruſhes, and réedes, and alſo the rootes of white thorne, the which ye ſhall beat well with a peſtell of yron, and then mixe it with raine water, without giuing them anye other thing to drinke. If this do not helpe, yee muſt ſell them, and if yee cannot ſell them, then it were beſt to kill them, and ſalte them. And after a certaine time, yee muſt recouer another heard. But ye muſt not do this before the dangerous time of this peſtilence be ſpent, or that yeare paſt, as if this ſhould bee in winter, ye muſt abide vntill the ſommer next following after. Or if it be in Autumne, then tarry vntill the ſpring time. And when ſome of them ſhall chaunce to fall ſicke in the houſe, ye muſt giue them the like remedy, as it is afore ſaid of the ſhéepe.
                     
                        
And when their ſkin ſhall ſwell or inflame, and that the goat is full of water, which the Greekes call Hydropiſis, a diſeaſe which cometh by drinking too much water. Ye muſt cut them a little with a ſharpe knife vnder the ſhoulder, and therby draw forth all the ſuperfluous moiſture, and then heale the wound with tar, and after that the ſhe goat hath borne kids, if her matrix be ſwolne, or that the ſecondine (which is the ſkin that the kids are lapt in) is not well borne, ye ſhal make her take a pint and a halfe of ſod wine, or if ye haue not that, ye ſhall giue her as much of other good wine, and to fill and ſtrengthen their nature with cerot liquide. Now to the end I will not againe recite that which I haue alreadie ſpoken (if any other diſeaſe do come vnto them) yee ſhall helpe them with ſuch medicines as I haue alreadye ſhewed heretofore in the remedyes for ſhéepe.
                     For goates haue the like diſeaſes as the ſhéepe and other cattell, and as they ſay, the goates are neuer without agues, for it is a common diſeaſe among them, and other diſeaſes they catch in their bringing forth of theyr young kiddes, as afore is expreſſed. This I thinke ſhall be ſufficient here at this time.
                     There is alſo in the tefs of goats, as in yowes, a certaine The ſtopping of the tets. ſtopping in ſome of their tets, which is a hard matter like a ſtrawe of flegme, which will be in the cundit of the teat, with a little blacke head, ſome will ſticke ſo faſt that the kid or lambe cannot drawe it foorth, and ſo long they can haue no milke. Therefore muſt the ſhepheards ſée to all ſuch things, at the lamming or kidding time, or els the lambs and kids are like to ſtarue.
                     Let the kéeper alſo looke vnto his goats, that the females be not chaſt or hunted when they be great with kids, for if they be, they will be in danger of the miſturning the kids in their bellies, which cauſeth the kids oftentimes to die, & put the goats in great ieopardy: & ſo likewiſe with yowes great with lamb, if they be chaſt being great, it turnes their lambs in their bellies, and makes many miſcary in lambing time.
                     
                        
Thus much for the kéeping and ordering of goates.
                     If a ſheepe be bitten with any dog, ye ſhal clip away all the wooll thereabout nigh vnto the place, and then clap on a plaiſter of pitch and it will heale it.
                  
                  
                     To heale a tetter which is a drie ſcabbe.
                     YE ſhall take the rootes of ſorrell wild or tame, ſlice them and bruſe them a litle, and ſoke them in good vinegar two daies and two nights, & then rub the ſore therwith iiii. or v. times a day, and then let the roots ſo remaine in the vinegar ſtil. Uſe this and it wil help. Or take the gum of chery trées, and reſolue it in ſtrong vinegar, and rub the ſore therewith, and this wil helpe. Alſo Acerabacca bruſed and laid in vinegar to annoint, doth the ſame. Againe, the herbe cald pricmadam, growing commonly on walles, ſtampt with barrowes greaſe, and ſo remaine two daies, and then annoint therewith, doth like helpe. Or bolearmeniac mixt with ſope, and then to annoint therewith. All theſe are good againſt tetters, either for ſheepe or goats.

                     To helpe goates or ſheepe that haue an itch.
                     YE ſhall take of young broome the tendreſt yee can gette, and put a good quantitie thereof into a pot with chambe

For it will faſten the wooll, kil the ſcab, & alſo deſtroy the tikes. Often proued quoth Balgroue.

                     THe hogge is a hurtfull and ſpoiling beaſt, ſtout and hardie, and troubleſome to rule: he is a great rauener for his meate, becauſe hee is hote of nature. Hogs are commonly knowne to moſt men: therefore I will here let paſſe to ſpeake in euerie point thereof, but ſuch as ſhalbe moſt meete and neceſſarie to bee knowne.
                  There be of all ſortes to be had, but the meeteſt hauing and chooſing of them, is the males, and boore pigges, for Chooſing of hogges. they doe more reſemble the nature of the boore, then the ſow. And thoſe that are large and bigge of bodie are moſt expected, rather then thoſe of long and round of bodie. And they ought to haue a deepe bellie, with thicke and large thighes: not hauing his clawes very hye, nor yet verie long legs, but thicke and ſhort, with a great thicke necke. His groyne and ſnout ſhort and bending backwarde, with a broad thicke chine and yet thoſe are moſt knauiſhly giuen, when they are a yeare old: for they will engender and deſire to couer or to be couered within euerie ten monethes: and ſo will continue till they bee foure yeares of age: and one Boore is ſufficient for ten ſowes. Alſo the ſowes A Bore is ſufficient for ten ſowes ought to haue a long body, and all the reſt of her bodie like the other aforeſaide of the Bore. Whereas the countries are cold, and ſubiect to froſts, it is beſt there, to chooſe and haue hogs which haue hye and hard briſtles, thicke & blacke. if it be in temperate countries & warme againſt the ſunne: there ye may wel nouriſh thoſe hogs which haue thin, ſmal & low briſtles, becauſe they are cōmonly more tender then others. Alſo thoſe hogs which are noriſhed in houſes & towns, are moſt cōmonly whiter then others. A ſowe wil cōmonly bring pigs vntil ſhe be ſeauen yeares old, & thoſe ſowes tha

bringeth pigges, moſt often in the yeare, doe ſooner waxeolde then others: for ſome young Sow, well fed, being one yeare old, will haue pigges. The Sowes are beſt to bee couered in the moneth of Februarie: and when ſhe hath Couering 
                           〈…〉
                        es. Sowes go with pig 16. weeks. gone with pigge foure monethes or fifteene wéekes, then in the ſixtenth weeke, or beginning of the fifth moneth, ſhe will farro. Some (as they ſay) will haue pigges twice, ſome thrice a yeare. And when the graſſe is ſtrong and wette, it cauſeth them to bring aboundance of milke to noriſh their pigs the better: for when ſhe waxeth dry, and hath no milke to nouriſh them with, then muſt yee take them from her, and ſee to weane them, and ſo by litle and litle they will fall to eate graſſe and corne, and ſuch as falles on the ground. And thus in continuance they will waxe more ſtronger, to eate of all other kinde of meate. This order they chiefly vſe in villages where great troopes of hogges are vſed and kept together, bred and brought vp in townes, whereby at length there comes a great profit by them vnto the huſband. As in places and villages, nigh vnto great townes, or gentill mens houſes, in ſelling the young ſucking pigs which are alwaies readie money vnto them: and by this meanes the Sow is diſcharged of her pigs the ſooner. Whereby ſhe ſhall be the readier to bring pigs twice or thrice a yeare: and the boore pigs ought to be gelded when they are about ſixe monethes olde: for then they begin to waxe ſtrong in heate, and being vngelt till then they will grow to be more ſtouter hogges: and yet they commonly geld them when they are young vnder the damme, as being Gelding pigs. spaied Sowes. thrée wéekes or a moneth old, and ſome ſay they will haue the ſwéeter fleſh: but the trueth is contrarie, (as manie doe iudge,) becauſe they are too ſoone weakened in their nature: and therefore they will not be ſo large hogs. Some doe counſell to geld or ſpay the ſowes when they haue béene often couered, as of thrée or foure yeares: and to ſpay the ſowes is counted then beſt. Some thinke in ſpaying them of ſhots is beſt, in cutting them in the mid flanke with a ſharpe knife, two fingers broad, in taking out the bag of

birth, and cutting it off, and ſo they doe ſtitch vp the wound againe, and then annoynt it, and keep her warme in the ſtie two or thrée daies after, and thoſe that be ſpayde can bring no more pigges, nor the bores wil not ſéeke after them, and they will waxe the fatter.
                  Notwithſtanding, I cannot ſaie why they ſpay them except it ſhould be to fat them, or where there is want of meate to feede them. For where as plentie of meate is, better it is there to haue them bring vp pigges than otherwiſe. Of theſe kinde of Beaſtes yee ſhall finde in all countries chriſtened, and ſome are in mountaines as well as in plain countries. But the plaine and moyſt groundes, are far better for them, then the hot and drie grounds. For the forreſts and Commons are moſt conuenient for them to féede on. And where there is great plentie of Oake trées, Beech, Aſhe, and thorne, of Bryers, Hazels, and crabtrees, wilde peare, or Plumtrees, Fearne rootes, and ſuchlike, to féed them withall, from time to time. For theſe ſortes of trees doe not rype al at one time, but in diuers and ſundry times of the ſommer, which are almoſt ſufficient to nouriſh them all the yéere long, with helpe of graſſe and rootes, and ſome helpes now and then in Winter of other meate.
                  And where there is want of ſuch trees, yee muſt haue them to other féeding ground, and the beſt is to haue of dirtie, ſlymie and ſoft grounde, then to haue drie and harde ground. For in the in the ſoft ground, they maie the eaſier digge and ſéeke for wormes & rootes in the earth, and to toſſe and tumble in the durty water, which doth them much good in hot time. Wherein they muche delight to tumble them, becauſe ofttimes they would haue water to coole them in, which cooling dooth profite them much and eaſeth them of their great heate, which is a bréeder of the meazels. They Rootes good for hogs. doe féede in moyſt & marriſh grounds, where they haue manie ſmall and ſweet rootes, as flagge rootes, and the rootes of galingale, of ruſhes, reedes, and alſo the rootes of Daffadill, which is very good for hogges, knotgraſſe and ſuch like. And likewiſe in fallow fieldes they doe finde ſtore of rootes,

and wormes which doth make them fat. And as for other grounds couered with graſſe, they finde diuers ſortes of hearbes and fruites, ſo that in diuers partes thereof, they may haue beſides, of wilde plums, of peares, or hawes, ſloes and nuts, and ſuch like: and whereas ye ſhall ſée them haue ſcante of meate, ye muſt not then ſpare your Garners: for then ye muſt néeds helpe them a mornings with ſome meate, and likewiſe at night with ſome: for al the day before perhaps in féeding abroad they haue had litle or nothing. And therefore all good huſbands ſhould kéepe plentie of acorns after Michaelmas, to ſerue them all the yeare if they can. Acorns may be kept in Ceſtorns with water, Akornes kept. or to be dryed and kept in fats, for ſo ye may kéepe them from rats and mice: or to dry them and lay them on drye boardes, and giue thereof in their waſh, or drye with ſome beanes or other graine when it is good cheape, and what yee ſpend one way, yee may ſo profit an other waye.
                  Unto ſowes that giue ſucke, to eate of gréene hearbes, ſometimes it doth them hurt. Therefore in the morning before ye put them forth to feede, yee ought to giue them ſomewhat to kéepe them in hart: for much eating of greene graſſe in the ſpring, will cauſe them to be loſe bellied, which will make them leane. And ye ſhould not put hogges together Stying your hogges. like other cattell, in their ſtyes: but make them partitions therein. And to put the ſowes aſunder by them ſelues, and the young pigs by them ſelues. For when they are ſhut vp altogether, they tumble, toſſe, and lye out of order one vpon another, and thereby oftentimes makes the ſowes to caſt their pigs.
                  Alſo thoſe huſbandes that dwell by forreſts or commons, it were good for them to haue ſtyes in the ſaide forreſts, and commons, whereby they may at all times feede ſuch hogges as they ſhall ſeeme moſt meete. And there likewiſe vſe to giue them their meat, whereby they may within a while forget the comming to his houſe, and thereby he ſhall the leſſe bee troubled with them, from time to

time. And it were good to make the walles or hedges of your ſtyes of foure foote hye: for then your hogs or ſowes can not get ouer, nor yet others come vnto them. And ſo open at all times, that the keeper may looke into the ſtye, and to take account of them at his pleaſure, to ſée if he haue all or not, and to ſeee if anie ſowé doe ouerlay, or lye on her pigs, then to remoue her, and ſee vnto the pigs, ſo long as they be yong and tender.
                  The hoghearde or keeper ought alſo in keeping of them Hogheard watchfull. to be watchfull, diligent, painefull, ſeruiceable with wiſedome, and of a good nature: Being verie carefull to nouriſh them, from time to time: who ought alſo to haue in mind the number of all his hogges, ſowes and pigges, both old and young: and to haue regarde and conſider the profit and encreaſe of euerie one, from time to time. And likewiſe to take heede of his ſowes that they take no hurt, with dogges, or otherwaies when they are readie to farro: Sowes with pigge. but to ſhut them vp in the ſtyes, that they may farro there, for feare of caſting her pigges. For in farroing abroad, often times & many wayes they periſh, as with the Foxe, or other like chances: which is for lacke of looking to in time. Which to a poore man is a great loſſe, if hee conſider all thinges. Alſo when a ſowe doth farro, the keeper ought to ſee how manie pigges ſhe hath, (for ſome ſowes will eate of them, aſſoone as ſhe hath farroed them,) and therefore to looke well vnto them, and ſee what they be: and let them not ſucke of any other ſow, but of their owne damme. For if the pigges reſorte out of the ſtye, and goe among others, when ſhe lyeth downe to giue them ſ
                        〈…〉
                     e, they will ſucke with others, which may thereby ſoone be bitten of the ſtraunge ſowe. Therefore the beſt is, to ſee each ſow ſhut vp by them ſelues, that one hinder not the other: for at length yee ſhall not know the higges of the one ſowe from the other, except ye marke them.
                  And among a heard of many pigges, yee muſt haue of diuers markes, to know which is which. For els it Marking your
                           •
                         pigges. will trouble his wittes, to knowe one from an other.

And among a great number it wilbe a hard and a painfull thing to doe. Therefore it ſhall be good to tell them in going forth and comming in, as afore is declared: or to tell them in entring in at a doore, no bigger then one hogge or ſow may paſſe alone, in going in or comming forth. And looke that euerie ſow haue with her but her owne pigs, and ſo manie as ſhe ſhall beſt continue with, to nouriſh well, which is not aboue eight pigs, if ſhe haue any more, it were beſt to ſell the reſt being young, without yee perfectly ſée, that the ſow is well able to nouriſh them: for if ſhe be not, ye ſhall ſoone perceiue by decaying of the pigs, for they will ſoone waxe leane, and euerie pigge will but ſucke his drene or tette.
                  To weans pigs, whereas huſbandmen haue no ſtyes. They wene their pigs in tying a wollen cloth liſt about the vpper ſnowte, with a knot in the middeſt of the roofe of his mouth, ſo remaining vnder the pallet of his mouth, he can not draw any ſtore of milke: whereby the ſow will ſoone waxe drye.
                  And thoſe ſowes which are good bréeders of pigs, they ſhould be rather choſen that ſucke of the hinder tets, and sowes & good breeders. ought to be nouriſhed often with dry and ſod barley, for feare leaſt they beeing young, ſhoulde waxe leane, or fall into ſome ſickneſſe. Alſo the hogheard or keeper ought often to cleanſe their ſtyes: for although theſe kind of beaſtes be foule and filthie feeders, yet they doe deſire to lye cleane and drye in their ſtyes. Thus much heere for the nouriſhing and good keeping of hogs.
                  The maner and gelding of hogs, there is two times in the yeare to geld theſe kind of cattell beſt. One is in Gelding of hogs. the ſpring, and the other in Autumne after Michaelmas. The order how they doe geld: one way is thus. They make two croſſe ſlits or inciſions on the middeſt of the ſtones, vpon each ſtone one, and then put them forth, and ſo annoint them with tarre. There is an other maner of gelding, which is more gentle, and more faire: but ſomewhat more dangerous, if it bee not well done.

Neuertheleſſe I wil therin ſhew ſomewhat, and not ſo leaue it, which is: to ſlit on ſtone on the toppe, and after ye haue drawne foorth that, ye ſhall put in your fingers at the ſame ſlit, and with your launcet ſlit the ſkin betwéene the two ſtones, and by that ſlit ye ſhall cruſh forth the other ſtone, and ſo draw him foorth gently as the other aforeſaid: and and then to clenſe out the blood, and ſo anoint him with freſh greaſe. And thus ye ſhal make but one inciſion or ſlit on the codde. But this way is beſt for other cattel. For of all ſorts of catel, a boare may beſt be gelded being olde. Alſo againſt certaine ſickneſſe, they giue ſome remedies as hereafter ſhall follow.
                  The ſignes to know beſt when that your hogges haue Feuer in hogs. the feuer, is this. When they hang downe their heads or heare it aſide; or when they in féeding and paſtoring, do ſodeinly runne, and ſodeinly reſt againe, and ſo fall on the ground as they were aſtonied and giddie. Ye muſt therfore marke which ſide hee holdeth vp or hangeth his head, ſo that yee let him blood on the eare on the other ſide: and ye ſhall alſo open the greateſt vaine vnder his taile, two fingers from his rumpe or buttockes. But firſt yee muſt chafe and beate it with ſome wande or twigge, that it may bléede the better. Then if the infuſion (after yee haue drawne blood) doe beginne to ſwell, yee ſhall cloſe it togither in binding about the taile, the barke of a willow or of elme. And after this, yee ſhall kéepe him in the houſe the ſpace of a daie or two, and yee ſhall giue him as much warme water as hee will drinks, mixt with a pounde of barley meale.
                  And alſo for thoſe hogs which haue impoſtumes or curnels Impoſtume vnder the throat. vnder their throates. They ought to be let blood vnder the toong: and when ye haue drawne blood ſufficient, yee muſt rubbe and chafe all his throat and groine with ſalt, and pure wheate meale, beaten togither. Some doe ſay, there is not a better medicine then to make them to take with a horne) ſixe ounces of garum, which yee ſhall lightly haue at the Apothicaries. Then with a ſmall flaxen corde binde

thereunto with ferules of wood, and let them ſo hang about his necke, as they may touch the impoſtume and curnels, and they ſhal do wel againe.
                  Alſo when as your hogs doe caſt or vomit, is a ſigne Againſt vomit. their ſtomacke is not wel. Therefore yee ſhal giue them gratings or ſhauings of iuory, with a litle of dride beaten ſalt. And ye ſhal beate their beanes ſmall, and put them into the trough with their other meate before they goe to the field, and they wil then remaine the more in quiet there.
                  Alſo there comes ſometimes a ſicknes amongſt theſe Of a leanneſſe in hogges. beaſtes, ſo that many wil be ſicke togither, inſomuch ye ſhal ſée them waxe leane therewith, and they wil not then ſcantly eate any thing at all: and if ye driue them to the paſture or field, they wil réele and fall downe by the way. And if it take them in ſommer, they wil lie and ſléepe in the ſunne all day, and it taketh them as they had litargie, (which is a ſléepie Litargie in hogges. and forgetful ſicknes) if this diſeaſe then happen, they ſhut vp all their hogs togither in one houſe, and lets them there remaine a day and a night, without any meate or drinke. On the next day after, to thoſe that wil drinke, they giue them water, in the which is ſtampt the rootes of wilde cucumbers. And ſo many as haue drunke thereof, they will To vomit. begin to vomit, and by ſo vomiting, they are purged cleane thereof, and when they haue caſt and cleanſed all the choler and filth within their ſtomake, then yee may giue vnto them, peaſe, fetches or beanes, mixt with ſalt water, or to caſt of bay ſalt amongſt it, and then they make them to drinke luke warme water. And as it is very euil and pernicious for all beaſtes (in ſommer) to bee dry, ſo is it moſt chiefly in hogs. Yet I would not haue yee ſhould giue your hogs water twiſe a day, as yee doe other cattel, as goates, ſhéepe, and others: but if ye can in the canicular daies, let them féede nigh ſome riuer, pondes, or low marſhes. For their heat is then ſo great, they cannot ſuffice them to drinke water onely, but they muſt alſo turne and toſſe therein, ſpecially in myery and durtie water, the which doeth greatly refreſh and coole them, ſpecially thoſe which haue fatte and

great bellies. And herein nature doth ſhewe them what is good for them.
                  But if the ſituation of the place wil not ſuffer and permit, ye muſt then giue them largely drinke from the wel, or in ſuch a like place, or els to put plentie of water into their troughes. For if they haue not then all ſufficient thereof to drinke, they wil haue the diſeaſe of the lightes, which is, to be pursy, and ptiſicke. But this diſeaſe is eaſily remedied by putting in their eares the iuice of pomeile, ſo calde in French. In Latin Conſiligo, the which I take to bee the hearbe calde, light woort, or comphere.
                  Likewiſe your hogges oftentimes wil haue the paine of Milt pained. the milt, which doth oft trouble them: and then they wil go aſide and crooked with their bodies, which commeth by a great drought as ſome do iudge, but moſt by fruit, for when fruites doe fall from the trées, and lieth on the ground vntaken vp. Theſe beaſtes are ſo vnſaciable in following the ſwéetnes thereof, that thereby they engender this diſeaſe in the ſplene: The which ye ſhal remedie it, by making them troughes to féed out of, of the wood in Latin calde Tamarix, which as I thinke is calde in Engliſh quickbeme wood. And ye ſhal therein vſe to giue them their meate and drinke, and that wood wil remedie it. For out of that wood, wil come a water or moiſture, which wil heale the inflamation of that diſeaſe. Sometimes there comes inflamations in the milt, ſo that it bréeds a peſtilence among hogs, which comes by vnwholeſome times. And alſo the rather by their filthy bodies & féeding, or els by ſome infection through euil nouriſhment. Therfore it wil be good ſometime to kéep them faſting all a night in ſome dark place, to cōſume the ſuperfluous humors in them, which they do encreaſe by their rauening & gréedines. Which I wil not here leaue, but to ſpeake ſomewhat thereof hereafter.
                  Now as touching the vnnatural kind of ſome of the ſows, Sowes vnnat
                           〈…〉
                         rall. there be in ſome kinds of thē which are ſo rauining, they wil not paſſe to deuour their own pigs, which commeth clean againſt the nature of moſt cattel: & thoſe are not to be ſuffred

to liue, for they be alwaies dangerous to kéepe. Sowes may endure leaſt hunger, and ſome of them although they haue ſufficient meate, yet they will deuoure their yoong pigs, not onely their owne, but likewiſe others. Therefore ſome doth thinke it not good to nouriſh any hog or ſowe, with the garbedge and inwardes of beaſtes, as they doe in many places féede them with guttes and inwardes of beaſtes, as in butchers houſes and ſuch like. Nor yet a man ſhould not make any eſtimation of that hog or ſow, that is, deſirous to féede on carion or fleſh. For the vſuall cuſtome thereof, will make them mankinde: and by eating of dead carion and other fleſh, will at length make them fall to catching quicke cattell, and from thence to fall vnto liuely creatures, as I haue heard of credible perſons, ſay, that ſowes haue taken yoong children without the doores, as in barnes, being left alone. Some out of their cradelles béeing no bodie in the houſe. Therefore let euerie huſbandman beware of the kéeping of any ſuch rauening kinde of beaſt. For they are verie tender of noſe, and will ſmell farre off.
                  A hog is verie hurtfull after two or thrée yeares olde, therefore kill him, and if they fall once to eating fleſh which To feede a hog fatte. is dead, they will ſoone fall to other aliue, that whatſoeuer they doe once laie holde off, be it capon, chikin, ducke, lambe, or pigge, yee ſhall rather kill them, or ye make them to leaue, or to let it goe. And this ſhal bee ſufficient in this place for ſuch rauening cattell.
                  A way how to féed a hog fatte in ſhort time, is, ye ſhal take him vp, and put him in the ſtye, and giue him neither Meaſeld hogs to helpe. meate nor drinke, the ſpace of thrée daies and thrée nightes, and then giue him continually, and let it be chaunged once or twiſe a wéeke. And hee ſhal be ſo gréedie after his great hunger, that he wil alwaies be hungry in eating ſo, that he wil be fat in ſhort time.
                  A prooued way to helpe your meaſeld hog, or boare is, ye ſhal put him vp in the ſtie, and kéep him there thrée daies and thrée nights without meat or water, or any other thing.

Then take flue or ſixe apples, and in the toppes make a hole, and picke out the cores, and fill each apple in thoſe holes with the pouder of brimſtone verie finely beaten: and ſtop the ſaid holes with péeces of apples, and caſt them vnto the meaſeld hog, firſt one or two, and ſo the reſt, and béeing ſo hungry he wil eate them all, then let him ſo remaine two or thrée houres after, and then giue him a litle meate, and no more til the next morning, and the next morning ſerue him ſo againe, and giue him fiue or ſix apples as before mentioned. Thus vſe your hogge the ſpace of fiue or ſixe daies, and ye ſhall ſée him waxe as cleane as euer hee was before. Alſo they doe vſe for the ſame, to take the lées of ſope, mixt with ſome ſtrong lée of a bucke, and giues of that, and vſe him as the other aforeſaide, and giue him no meate of an houre or two after. And this (as ſome doe ſay) is counted verie good to helpe the foreſaid diſeaſe.
                  How to kéepe and ſaue your hogs from being meaſeld, is this, ye ſhal vſe in the ſommer, ſpecially in the time of the To ſaue them from meaſeld. canicular daies, or daies of heate, which is from the midſt of Iuly, to the midſt of Auguſt. And in theſe times to giue them chopt, (amongſt their waſh or other meate) of colde hearbes, as of lettis, endiue, ſuccory, violet leaues, of daundelion, or ſowthiſtle, fumitory, and ſuch like, which are all colde helpes, and wil kéepe them coole: or to chop amongſt their meate the leaues of dwale, which is verie cold in operation. Therefore vſe thereof the leſſe portion amongſt their meat. All theſe hearbes aforeſaid, are verie good to kéep them coole. For the cauſe of meaſelly in a hogge commeth Cauſe of meaſelry. through the great and vehement heate of his blood, or lying in horſe dung, & fleam togither mixt with his blood, through heate is dride in his bodie, and ſo lieth in the outward parts of his bodie in curnels. And firſt they will appeare in the liuer (through the heate of his ſtomacke) at the rootes of his toong, and in his throat: that when he doe cry, he wil rattle in his voice and crie hoarſe. By this yee ſhal firſt perceiue his infection: and if ye doe take forth his toong, ye ſhal perceiue the curnels there vnder, and by this order ye may perceiue

any meaſeld hog. Alſo (ſome do ſay) if you put muſtard Muſtard is ill for hogs. amongſt your waſhings and giue that vnto your hogges, it will (to vſe much thereof) cauſe them to bee meaſeld at length, or ſuch like which doeth much heate their blood. Alſo to kéepe them from being meaſeld ye may vſe to put amongſt their waſh, of mens vrine, and mixe with their waſh alſo of red oker, called red earth, beaten ſmall to pouder. This wil likewiſe kéepe them from beeing meaſeld. Sope water, and fiſh water is ill.
                  Whenſoeuer ye doe entend to fat any hog, to giue him drye meate is counted chiefeſt, and giue him to drinke béere, Fatting a hog. or ale and water: and yee muſt not let him goe foorth of the ſtye, not ſo much as to ſée forth thereof, but to open the ſtye dore and to make it cleane: for a hog when he may ſee forth, hee wil haue ſo much deſire to goe abroad, that hee will haue no care to féede. There is not ſo much care to be had in them, as in other cattell, yet to kéepe them cleane, they loue to haue it. And ſo to be fed and not remooued or changed into any other place, or by any other meanes troubled: yet ſometimes they are (in the ſtye) a little troubled with Mice in the flie. myce, in running on their backes, and ſo diſquiets them in the ſtye: which ye may ſoone helpe by ſetting of trappes, to take them alwaies as they come. Thus ye may féede them to bee a foote and a halfe thicke of fatte in ſmall time.
                  If your hogs haue eaten any euill hearbe, as of henbane or hemblocks. To remedie the ſame, yee ſhall giue them to Hogs ſicke by ill hearbes cating. drinke the iuyce of cucumbers, made warme, the which being drunke, wil cauſe them to vomit, and thereby they wil cleanſe their ſtomackes and ſo recouer health againe. Some doe vſe to giue them aquauitie, and puts thereof into his noſthrils, or in one of his eares, or to giue him water and hony mixt togither with a good quantitie, and that wil cauſe him alſo to vomitte. For if it can make them vomit, they will ſoone recouer againe. For by eating either of henba
                        •
                     e or hemblocke, they are ſo cold in operation, they wil cauſe the hog to lye as though hee were dead for a

time, for they are verie nigh vnto a cold venome. And the camelion thiſtle wil kil them, to eate thereof. The hearbe called gooſe foote, wil alſo kil hogs.
                  Alſo if any of your hogs haue the laſke or runneth out, to Laske to ſtop. heale the ſame, ye ſhal giue them of dride beans, and beaten ſmall, and then mixt with branne. Some do take and mixt therewith the pouder of redde earth, or the pouder of dride knot graſſe, or the pouder of the hulles of acornes, or acorne cups, and mix any of theſe aforeſaid with theſe dride beanes, and let him eate thereof dride, and giue him no drinke of an houre after, and he ſhall doe wel againe.
                  Theſe hearbes are good and wholeſome for hogs, daffadil Hearbes good for hogs. rootes which are good to clenſe the lightes of hogs. And knot graſſe the which a hog loues marueilous wel, and it bindes the belly, and cauſeth vrine, and the iuyce thereof put into his eare, wil helpe the paine of the head. And all the hearbes afore mencioned, are wholeſome for hogs.
                  The garget is an ill griefe and many dye thereof, which The garget in a hog. is a ſwelling and inflamation in the throate behinde the iawes of the hog, I can learne no other remedie but this. They doe vſe to ſlit it in the midſt, as long as the inflamation or ſore is, and then flea vp the ſkinne on both ſides the ſlits, ſo farre as the ſore is, and then all to rub it with ſalt within, and laies tarre without, and ſo he recouers. Some rubbes it with nettles and ſalt. Some with plantaine, with ſome burnt allume mixt. Other with the iuyce of cuckoſpit, and ſalte and ſtubwort mixt, and rub it therewith.
                  There is a ſicknes in ſommer amongſt hogs, which ye Sicke hogs to know. ſhal ſooneſt know, by plucking a handfull of his briſtles on his backe, and ye ſhall plucke them againſt the haire. If (when yee haue pluckt them) they bee cleane and white at the roote, then he is well and ſound: but if they ſéeme at the roote bloodie or ſpottie, it is to be noted, he is not then well within his bodie.
                  Likewiſe hogges are ſubiect oft to the diſeaſe of the mylt, Diſeaſe of the milt. and likewiſe vnto the peſtilence, which increaſeth by eating of vnwholſome meats & drinks, & by vnwholſome times, for

their bodies are apt to receiue ill aires, and ſoone corrupte, and moſt of all by their filthie féeding. They are alſo ſubiect vnto feuers and agues, for the which thing, they let them Peſtilent feuer. blood on the taile. And for the catarre, or inflamation in the necke, growing with certaine curnels, which is thought to be a kinde of lepre or meaſelry. For the which thing, they let them blood vnder the toong: if that wil not helpe, then ye muſt ſlit it and vſe it as ye doe for the garget, which is afore mencioned.
                  Hogs wil haue the catarre or reume, it wil make their eies to water, and a moiſture aſcending vp into their heads, Catar in hogs. and it commeth to them commonly by eating of fruit when they fall off from the trées, or when there is great ſtore therof, and by eaſing of rotten fruit, which bréedeth a corrupt matter, nigh vnto the plague. And likewiſe it doth encreaſe catarres, and inflamations in the bodie. The remedie is, they doe vſe to giue them of olde capars, with their waſh, or other meate, and they vſe alſo to put amongſt their meate, of colewortes, both redde and white. And likewiſe they put of Thamarix, which I take to be the quick beame trée, or the hearbe called Amaranthus, which ſome doe call floures of loue. And for the ſame, to take of marſh mallowes, and mixe them among their meate, or for to take liuerwoort boyled in honied water and giuen. All the other aforeſaide are verie good to ſtaie the reume or catarre.
                  Hogs wil haue alſo a diſeaſe in the gall, which is called the flowing of the gall, and is when the gall is ſo full of choler, Flowing of the gall. that it flowes in all parts of the bodie. And beſides, wil cauſe a ſwelling vnder the iawes of the ſwine. The remedie is, to ſtampe the inner barke of elder, and ſtraine it with ale or béere, and giue it warme. Alſo ſome takes a handfull of gall woort, ſtampe it and ſtraine it, and giue it with honied water. And for the ſwilling, they do rub and chafe it with beaten ſalt, and pure wheate meale mixt togither. And ſome doe firſt cut the ſkin as afore is mentioned, in fleaing it on both ſides, and then to rub it all ouer on both ſides with ſalt, and ſo letteth it goe, and it wil heale ſo againe.
                  
                     
Another way to helpe any hogge, if hee be not far gone Meaſell to help. with the meaſels, to recouer him againe. Yee ſhal take your hogge and put him in the ſtye for a day and a night without any meate or drinke. Then take a quart of ſtale or old piſſe, or mens vrine that hath béene kept long, and therein put a good handfull of redde earth, or redde oker, made in fine pouder, with a quarter of a pound of blacke ſope: then ſtir and mix it with the piſſe all wel togither, and then ſet it vnto the hog, if hee make daintie to drinke thereof, ye ſhal then put thereto a quantitie of whay, if he wil not yet take it, then put in more whay, for ſo he wil take it the ſooner, if not, force him to take it: and when hee haue all dronke it, let him ſo reſt two or thrée houres after, and then giue him ſome other meat, not much: and ſo let him reſt without any more meat til the next morning, and then vſe him ſo againe, and let him haue ſo euery morning for a wéekes ſpace or more, as yee ſhall haue cauſe therein, and ye ſhal ſée experience good.
                  How beſt to féede a boore in the ſtall. Some doe vſe to To feed a bore beſt. giue him of beanes and peaſe, and ſometimes for change, to giue him dry barley, with ſuch like.
                  But if ye wil haue that your brawne ſhal féede wel and be faire, white and tender, yée ſhal giue him no other thing, but faire branne and whay mixt togither ſomewhat thicke: which wil both féede your bore very well, and kéepe him coole alſo from being meaſeld.
                  How beſt to ring your hogs in times conuenient, and becauſe hogs are commonly rauening for their meat, more Ringing of hogs. then other cattel, it is meet therefore to haue them ringed, or elſe they wil doe much hurt in digging and turning vp corne fieldes, ſpoyling of medowes, defacing of commons, moyling in parkes, turning vp cloſes, diſordering orchards and gardens: and diſtroying all fine paſture for all other cattell. And in moſt places for lacke of good order and gouernment. One neighbour, being negligent and careleſſe, ſpoiles thrée or foure of his neighbours groundes with his hogs, more in a day, then can be repairde againe in halfe a yeare. And the cauſe is chiefly, for lacke of ringing in time

conuenient, and they ſpoile and turne vp much faire commons and paſture grounds, in ſéeking for wormes & rootes, hauing graſſe and féeding inough beſides. One hog (as ſome do ſay) wil turn vp and ſpoile as much paſture ground in a day, as wil paſture ten beaſts in ten daies, which is a great loſſe among poore men, that hath the moſt féeding for their cattell on the commons, to haue ſo much paſture ground deſtroyd. Wherefore the common ſaying is, the hog is neuer good, but when he is in the diſh. Prouerbe.
                  
                  Therfore me thinks it ſhall not be here vnméete, to ſpeake ſomething more of the ringing of them: wherein ſome men doe vſe to peg them with pegs of holly, or ſuch like harde wood and horne, but this kinde of pegging will not long endure, for they wil ſoone weare or breake aſunder. And ſome do ring them with red wyer, becauſe they wil not ſtand to any further coſt, and that is alſo ſoone worne aſunder, for red wyer is too ſoft. Others doe put ringes of yron, ſome with horſe nailes or ſtrong white wyer, in the groin of their ſnoutes, and thoſe are counted much better to endure, and yet for all thoſe ringes they wil breake the ground, if it be any whit ſoft: therfore it grieueth them ſmally as it ſhould ſéeme.
                  And ſome others do ſlit their groine vnder, but when that is growne whole againe, they wil alſo dig notwithſtanding, for all theſe waies doe ſmally preuaile, if they be not looked to from day to day. To cut the griſtle aſunder is better.
                  Some doe vſe (in the ſpring) to ring and alſo yoake their hogge, at ſuch time as when they may féede or haue bitte of graſſe, and ſo lettes them remaine all the ſommer, for tearing of hedges, which is thought not vnméete for the ſauegard of corne. Some others, doe vſe to ring them at Michaelmas, and ſo lets them remain, (if it be a yeare of maſt) vnto Nouember or December, or killing time, but they doe feare hanging in hedges: they do vnyoke them ſoone after Michelmas. They do alſo in ſome places in Germany (as I haue ſéene) ring them from the ſpring all the ſommer vnto December or killing time. So that al the ſommer long, ye

ſhall ſée no medow ground broken or digged with hogs, except ſome rings breake or weare aſunder: ye may there goe a hundreth miles compaſſe ere yee ſhall ſée ſo much grounde digged, & turnd vp with hogs, as ye ſhal do here in one common or pariſh, & yet their hogs are as fat & as faire as oures, and they haue no other féed but graſſe, rootes, & herbes in the fallow fieldes. And I was there taught how to ring a hog yt 
                     The double ring. hee ſhould lightly neuer dig or breake any medow grounde, though it be light and ſoft. Which is, ye ſhall take a good big white wier, & ſtiffe withal, being two or thrée inches long or more, according to the bignes of the hogs ſnout, and make it ſharpe at both endes, & bow it ſtaple wiſe with two corners nigh an inch wide, then make two holes through his ſnout of the ſame widenes, and put it vp through the griſtle of his ſnout, hard vnto the bent of the ſtaple: then with a paire of plyers, bowe and turne the pointes of the wyer into the holes of his noſthrils, like a ramines horne. So that when ſoeuer hee doe offer to dig or turne vp any thing, the ſharpe endes of the wyer in turning, will pricke him alwaies in the tender holes of his noſthrils: and ſo they ſhal neuer dig, but ſtil gaze on the grounde continually from time to time, and ſhall neuer offer to dig in any kinde of ground, but ſéeke ſtill to gaze. And yet to bee at all times as faire as oures here in Englande, with now and then giuing them ſome meat at home, in their houſes or ſties, and ſomewhat at putting foorth in the morning, and alſo at comming home at night. Thus ye may kéep your common paſturing grounds alwaies whole vnſpoyld or turnd vp, and your hogs to bee in as good liking, with a litle more paine and charge, as the other vnringde. This kinde of ringing hogs, ſhall be ſet in figure heere vnder, for the more perfect and further knowledge thereof. And this ſhall be ſufficient for the ringing of hogges in this ſort. Alſo to ring hogges they ſhall not dig, ſome doeth put a redde paſte wyer vnder the ſkinne of his ſnout, an inche from the groine, and an inche broade, then wrethe it togither on the middeſt of his ſnout, and it is done. Some doe vſe to cutte aſunder

the ſinowes on both fides of his ſnout, a ninche from the groine: and when hee would dig, the groine of his noſe will fall downe.
                  
                     The figure of ringing, like the Rammes horne.
                  
                  
                     Here followeth a verie good way how to feede a Hogge for larde.
                     
                        FIrſt, ye ſhal prouide two plankes or thicke bordes for him To feed a hog for larde. to lye on, or els to lie on pauing ſtones or pauement: and ye ſhall féede him with barley and peaſe, and no beanes, and giue him no other water but the tappings and waſhings of hogs heads. And ſometimes ye ſhal change his meate, and giue him ſodde barley, and ſo chaunge his meate often, and when ye ſée he beginneth to glut, which will be within ten daies, Then to chaunge his diet, giue him a handfull of crabbes, and vſe him ſo once in ten daies. But if ye thinke it wil be a loſſe or ſpoile of meate to giue him much, ye may giue it him in a ſmaller veſſell, and a litle at once. If ye can make him drunk now & then, that wil make him to be a notable fat hog, within thrée monthes féeding. But after one month ſome doe féede him with peaſe, or dowe made of barley meale, and féedes him therewith the ſpace of fiue or ſixe wéekes and nothing els, without any drinke or other moyſture, which is counted the chiefeſt way of féeding. Thus much for the féeding of him.
                     
                        
How to kill him is thus, ye ſhall ſticke him and ſcalde him as ye do another hog, and then cut off his head and his féete, and open him in the backe, in making a narrow chine, then open him and take foorth his inwards, and then with a cloth dry away cleane all his blood within, and take forth the ribs as ye do a balribbe, and cut off the gammons, and ſalt the fillets in a cloſe veſſell, then cloſe and couer it, that no ayre enter: and in nine daies after, ye may not touch or open it. Then cut all the reſt in péeces as yee ſhall thinke beſt, and ſalt them in a barrel with faire and dry white ſalt. Then when ye ſhall néede to take forth any péece to occupy or ſell, put not the reſt ye take forth into the barrell againe, for that wil feſter and hurt the reſt. Therefore take foorth no more then ye occupy: and that péece yee take forth to occupie, wil ſerue and endure wel thrée wéekes, beeing lapte and couered with dry ſalt, and ye may kéepe this larde ſo in barrel ſwéete and good, fiue or ſix yeeres to occupie.
                     Alſo the hogheards ſay, to help a meaſeld hog, giue him Meaſeld to help. dride peaſe and beanes in the ſtie, and no drinke but mens vrine, and there by vſing, it wil make him cleane.
                     Alſo hogs wil couet to eate of mens dung, pigins dung, Ill for meaſels. and hennes or poultry dung, which alſo is ill for hogs, and wil encreaſe a meaſell among them, and likewiſe other diſeaſes, and to lye in horſe dung, is ill for them.
                     For the ſtaggars in a hog, giue him of the hearbe called Staggars. ſtare woort, or gall woort in milke, and he ſhall amend.
                     Pigges that are farroed with téeth, the males of them Ariſtotles ſayings. paſſing thrée yeares, doe not wel engender. A hog dieth and pineth away, if hee léeſe one eye. A hog wil liue xvi. or xx. yeares. Hogs haue many ſickneſſes in their heads and ſides, and being ficke, they will commonly lye in dirtie puddles, and commonly they wil lye more on the right ſide, then on the left. If yee kéepe them without meate thrée daies at the firſt, they wil be fat within fortie daies. They loue each other, and know each others voice, and if one cry, they wil cry all, and wil helpe one another. They grunt ſléeping and waking, if they be fat. And they ſléepe faſter in May, then at

other times: and that commeth of mourning or ſtopping of the braines in that time, more then in other times. They reſolue in ſommer many humors, in waſting it by too much heate. And hogs change not their teeth, neither male, nor female. A boare wil gender within the firſt yeare, or being of eight monethes olde: and the ſow at a yeare olde. But thoſe pigs wil be but weake and féeble, and the firſt pigs of a ſow wil be ſlender of body. And if ſhe be fat, her milke wil be more ſcarce. The winter pigs are better thē the ſomer pigs: and thoſe of yoong ſowes, worſe then thoſe of old ſowes. A luſtie Winter pigs. & fat boare may engender many times, both in the day and night, and beſt time is in the morning. When a ſow farroeth, ſhe giueth to the firſt pig the farmoſt teate. And a ſow in going to the boare againe, ſhe wil not ſuffer him to couer her, vntil her eares hang downeward. To make them goe to brimme or take the boare, it ſhalbe good to giue them of barley, which wil make them take the boare, and to giue them of ſod barley, the better for her. Hogs commonly hath thrée euils, one is Brancos,
                     
                     The other is impoſtumes in their eares, and iowles. And the third is in the féete: and the fleſh about thoſe places Diſeaſes in hogs. is moſt corrupt, and that corruption paſſeth by ſome and ſome, into the fleſh neare vnto it, and ſo to his lunges, and ſtoppeth them: and then the hog wil die. This euil encreaſeth ſodeinly. And therefore hogheards do cut away the place firſt infected, which otherwiſe wil not be helpt or held but by cutting.
                     They haue alſo another ſicknes, which is, great ache and heauines in their heads, and thereby commonly dieth. Ache in their heales. Another ſicknes they haue, which is, the flux of the belly, (which I haue partly ſhewed before) and is a diſeaſe hard to remedie. For often it killeth them within thrée daies, Great ſwine doe delight to eate berries, as floes and blackberries, which doth them good. They alſo ye delight to bathe them in warme waters. They are commonly let blood to help them, on the vain vnder the toong, & they are made fat with diuers kinds of meats, but ſome do make them fwel. Some engendreth

fleſh, and ſome greaſe and fatnes. And hogs delighte in acorns, which makes them to haue good fleſh. If a ſow being wt pig eate much therof, it maketh them caſt their pigs.
                     For diſines in their heads, chop mowſeare, & nightſhade, Miſtriſſe Riſley. and put it among their waſh, and they ſhal mend.
                     To put and choppe of colde hearbes all the ſommer into Cold hearbes in ſommer. their waſh, and giue it them amongſt their meate, as lettiſe, endiue, ſuccorie, daundelion, cinckfoile, ſowthiſtle, and ſuch like. Elme leaues in the ſpring, are good to giue vnto hogs Elme leaues for hogs. when there is ſcant of graſſe or other meate. But to giue them much thereof, may bring them into a 
                           ••
                        ix. Therefore to vſe all their meates diſcréetly, it ſhall doe beſt, and ſo ſhall ye kéepe them long in health. Helion reciteth in his hiſtorie, Henbane. that hogs and wilde boares eating of henbane, will ſodoinly fall in a ſounde, and are in danger to die, if incontinent they be not waſhed all ouer with water, and to drinke water alſo. Whereupon they wil ſeeke water and ſo recouereth again: againſt which, woormwood is good to giue them with wine or ſtrong ale.
                     To féede or fat hogs (as ſome huſbands ſaith) with ſuch Hogs greaſe. things which will alter their greaſe, as to féede them with barley, it wil fat and ſoone puffe them vp, but their greaſe wil be ſoft and waſtfull. To féede hogs alſo with acorns, or béech maſt, oakes, and fetches doth the like, and all other graine, except beanes and peaſe, which will make them to haue a hard and a faſt greaſe, to bee fedde onely therewith.
                     Another prooued way to helpe a meaſeld bore or hog is: Ye ſhal firſt ſearch them before ye put them vp to be fed, and Meaſeld to helpe. then ſée, if they be not clene, Take & warme a pinte or more of cow milke, & mixt therewith ſo much gray ſope as a great teniſe ball, and ſtir it then well altogither til it be all alike. And being milke warme, giue it to your boare or hog, with a horne, & make him of force to take it, in ſtriking it downe his throat til he haue receiued all. Then chafe and ſtir him an hours ſpace after, for feare of caſting it vp again, vſe him thus thrée or foure daies or more, vntil ye ſhal ſée him clean,

and then ye may put him vp to fat, and they ſhall doe well.
                     And alſo to make a hog to ſcoure, they doe vſe to giue Hogs to ſcoure. him of ſmoaked barley in the ſtraw, as it is alſo ſhewed for the whethering of a cow to helpe.
                     Alſo if your hogs be louſie, which wil come vnto them through pouertie, and lacke of good kéeping in winter. And Lice to kill. ſo long as they be louſie, they wil not proſper. The remedie is, ye ſhall take of quickſiluer, and kil it with ſallet oyle and faſting ſpittell, then mixt therewith of freſh greaſe, or neats foote oyle, and ſo anoint them all ouer. Some meltes ſope and tarre togither, with the pouder of ſtaueſacre, and therewith anoints them. And other ſome doe take but quickſiluer and ſope mixt well togither, and ſo anointes therewith: for lyce wil kéepe them leane.
                     Moreouer, if a hog chance to be ſore bitten of dogges in Hogge bitten. any part of his bodie or legges, and thereon doe ſwell, and like to come to an impoſtume, to auoide the danger thereof, ye ſhall all to waſh the wounde betimes, with ſtale, ſalt, and nettles bruiſed, or vinegar and mallowes, boilde togither, with ſome hogges greaſe put thereto: and therwith all to bathe the ſore, then anoint it with tarre and freſh greaſe mixt well togither, and he ſhall doe well. Uſe this as yee ſhall ſée cauſe.
                  
                  
                     A bathe for Swine that haue the ſwine pockes.
                     THe ſwine pockes in hogs is an ill ſore, for it will runne abroad, and is a ſcabbe verie grieuous. They come to hogs ſometimes by pouertie, ſometimes by liſe in the ſkin, and when hogs haue them, they wil neuer proſper ſo long as they haue them. And one wil infect another of them. The remedies. Some do vſe to giue them the pouder of brimſtone with ſtale. A bathe to waſh them is this. Take yarrow,

plaintaine, primroſe leaues, bryar leaues, olde oken leaues of a yeare, of water bittonis, of each two handfuls, boile them in two gallons of runnning water, till they are all tender: and then all to waſh your hogs or pigs therewith, and vſe this once or more, and it will drye them vp: for it is but a corrupt water, being betweene the fleſh and the ſkinne, and ſo growes to a ſcabbe.
                  
                  
                     How to ſpaye a Sowe.
                     YE ſhall firſt lay her vpon ſome forme or boarde, then binde her mouth cloſe with ſome corde, then lay her on her right ſide, ſo that her left ſide be vpwarde: and then take your launcet and ſtréepe away the haire two inches long, thrée fingers from the hinder legge, and likewiſe from the edge of her flanke: then with the point of your launcet cut a flope her bellie through the ſkinne two inches long, and a halfe, ſo that you may put in your fore finger towards her backe: and there you ſhall feele two curnels as bigge as acornes, on both ſides the birth, and with the toppe of your finger, hooke or draw the one to the ſlitte: then cut the ſtring with your knife, and ſo take forth the other likewiſe. If then yee can not eaſily finde them, ye ſhall with your finger draw ſoftly forth ſome of the ſmal trailes, & ſo ye ſhal finde them, and then cut them off, and put in the trayles with your finger againe: then ſtrike away the bloud, and ſtitch vp the ſlit againe with a ſtrong threede, but beware her guts, and then annoint thereon with tarre, and ſo let her goe.
                     And they doe vſe to geld young Boares, in holding Gelding 
                              〈◊〉
                            Bore. them betwixt their knées, the Boares rump vpward, and reſting vpon his fore féet, and then puts out the right ſtone, and cuts it croſſe ouer the ſtone on the midſt, and ſo puſhes it forth, and cuts of the ſtring at the right end: and ſo doe likewiſe with the left ſtone, and then anoint them with tarre thereon, and let him goe: and they ſhall doe well.
                  
                  
                     
                     The manner of ſpaying of Coltes, Sheepe, and Sowes, whereof I will briefly ſpeake ſomewhat more.
                     YE ſhall vnderſtande that Mare coltes are commonly ſpayed within nine dayes after they are folde, if they be older it is not ſo good, for they ſay in ſpaying it will bee the harder to reach with his finger and to doe that thing wel: for in taking forth the birth, if it periſh, the colt wil die ſoone after.
                     Alſo in ſpaying a yeawe is daungerous, if yee hurt the bagge of birth, or periſhe any part of her tallow, ſhee is like to die ſoone after. The ſpaying of a Sow, is not ſo daungerous as the other, but maie eaſtlie be done in taking good heede. Alſo in the ſpaying of theſe cattell, when ye haue cut the flanke toward the hinder ribbes two fingers long ſlopewiſe, yee ſhall put and feels with your forefinger, on both ſides the bagge or birth certaine knots like kyrnels or cluſters like grapes, which doe cleaue to both the ſids of the bag or birth vnder the raines or rumpe, which yee ſhall touche them with your forefinger, and laye them downe ſoftly to the wounde, and ſo plucke them out and cut it off, and caſt it away, which is but a ſmall ſtring they hang by.
                     Thus ſhall ye doe in likewiſe to the other ſide of the bagge, or birth, when they be out, cut of the ſtring and it is done. If ye periſh the bagge or birth, ſhe wil ſoone die after, what beaſt ſo euer it be. Ye ſhal note alſo in the ſtitching vp the wound, if ye ſtitch the guts withall, ſhe wil die ſoone after (as I haue ſeene) except ſhe be ſoone ript and ſtitched againe, which is done by raſh ſpayers of beaſts in ſtitching ye guttes and the ſkin together, and ſo the beaſtes wil pine away, and die within few daies after. Thus much here I haue ſeene and learned for the ſpaying of theſe cattel.
                  
                  
                     
                     Alſo the nature and ordering of Hogges.
                     ASow will haue pigges at a yeere old, and ſhe wil cōtinue good ſixe yeres, & when ſhe is with pig, ye ſhall put the bore from her, for he wil hurt the pigs in her belly, and make her to caſt them. The bore wil brim, at ſixe moneths old, at eight moneths, and after three or feure yeeres yee may gelde him. A Sowe ſhoulde not bring vp aboue ſixe or eight pigs, to bring vp more: it wil make her ſoone faile. A Sow great with pig ought to haue ſties by themſelues. For if a ſow do eate her pigs it is no wonder, for ſwine can leaſt away with hunger, for they are hoate beaſts, a ſow ſhould not goe abroade in nine or ten daies after her farrowing, ye wrinckled tailes of hogs, is ſigne of ſound hogs. Alſo after ye cut or geld, giue them no drinke, and but a little meate. In ſpaying, looke that the ſkin be ſound, iuſt, and cloſe vp, and then annoint it with a little freſh greace, or freſh butter, note alſo, if ye plucke briſtles on the backe of a hog, if there be blood in the endes thereof, he is not then in health.
                     If a hogge bée ſicke of a feuer, he wil hang his head on the one ſide, and ſodaine ſtaie, be giddy and fal, Mark which ſide he holdes his head, then cut his contrary eare, and lette him bleede. Likewiſe two ynches from the rumpe, let him blood vnder the tayle, but firſt with a ſmall wande beate his tayle, and then he will bleede the better. Which blood yee ſhal ſtop with the barke of willow bounde about it, ſo keepe him in the ſtie a day or two after, and giue him warm water mixed with Barley flower. When a Hogge is not well, giue him Polypody or Oake ferne rootes boyled in beere or ale, for that wil purge him of flegme, and ſome choler, which cōmonly ſwine are moſt troubled withal. Againſt ſicknes of the lungs, put the roote of Fetterwoort through their eares, & it wil help them againſt the mezell. Some huſbands ſay, if yee nayle plates of ledde in the bottome within their troughes, it wil preſerue and keepe them

from being meazell. Alſo the common medicine, is allum brimſtone, red oaker, and Bay beries, of eche like, and put thereto a handful of hare foote, beaten altogether with ſome madder, and put al into a bagge, and caſt it into their water or waſh which they drinke, and ſo renew it twiſe a yere.
                     Moreouer, ſome huſbands hold opinion that the mezelry to hogs comes not only thorow heate in Sommer, but chiefly by pouertie in Winter: alſo they ſay, if a cleane bore doe brimme a meazell ſow, he ſhal become meazell, ſo like wiſe a cleane ſow being brimde with a mexell Bore, ſhe ſhall likewiſe become meazel, and all thoſe piggs. The beſt time to kil a mezel bore, or hog, is after the changes of the moone. For then the curnils wil ſhew ſmalleſt.
                     Alſo they do feede hogges in ſome part of this Realme very Feeding of hogs in ſtyes. fatte, onely with figge duſt of Dates, which will feede them in ſhorte ſpace, ſome doe mixe it with warme water, ſome with whay, and ſome doe ſeeth it with water, and make it thicke like a groute, and in other places huſbandes doe fatte their hogs, whereas ſcant of feeding is, with peaſe, and they reſerue in leaſing their corne after harueſt all the charſe, darnell, and cockell, which they ſeeth in water, and make it thicke, & ſo feede them therewith. Thus yee maie make in 14. daies good bakō, of two ynches and more thick of fat.
                     Alſo there is to be noted, (as ſome good huſbandes ſaie,) if ye doe fatte your hogges in a cloſure abroade without houſing, it wilbe long eare they waxe fatte, for when a raine doth come, it doeth greatly annoye them and hinder their fatting, for if a hogge lye not drie, and warme, and alſo quiet: he will not bee fatte, in a long ſeaſon.
                     Therefore when yee doe intende for to fatte hogges, put not paſt two or three at once together in the ſtye, for when yee put many together, one fighteth with another, both at meate and in lying, which wil hinder their fatting. And alſo to keepe them as darke in the ſtie as ye can. For whē a hog may ſée abrode, he wil remēber & lōg for paſture, and is deſirous to ſéeke for wormes and rootes, which wil alſo

hinder their feding. Thus much here for the feeding, & ordering or fatting hogs in the ſties.
                  
                  
                     A good waie to fatte hogges after the maner of Duchland.
                     YE ſhall put your hogges into the houſe, and keepe them hungry at the firſt. Then take the rootes of turnepes, & boyle them in whay, if yee can. If not, in water: and boile therewith of barley, and giue them the rootes a fewe at once, with ſodde barley among. And when your hogges are vſed to them, they will eate them as faſt as other meate, and they wil be aſſoone fatte with them, as anie other graine.
                  
                  
                     To helpe the garget in a hogge.
                     THe garget is a diſeaſe commonly among hogs, and as ſome huſbandes doe ſaie, it commeth of ranknes of blood and they commonly haue it in winter as wel as in ſommer. The beſt remedy is as aforeſaide, but ſome doe counſell it beſt to ſlit him two ynches long on both ſides of his iawes, and then open the ſkinne a litle on both ſides the cuttes, and then all to rubbe it with bay ſalt within vnder the ſkinne, and he will doe well againe.
                     If then the flies be buſie, ye ſhall lay a little of tarre all ouer thereon, and he ſhal doe well.
                     All ſome huſbandes do teache to ſaue hogs from the Let blood. ſaide garget, they vſe to let them blood at Michaelmas, and in Aprill, on the baine vnder the vpper lippe. For that is the choſen place to helpe hogs, if they droupe, or wax ſick.
                  
                  
                     To preſerue hogges and ſaue them from being meazell.
                     YE ſhal mixe with their waſh, or whay (in the moneth of Iune) Of chamberlye and madder, and ſo giue thereof

vnto your hogges, and vſe it nowe and then once or twice a wéeke, & it wil preſerue them all that Sommer, from being mezel, which cauſe I haue ſhewed afore.
                  
                  
                     If a hogge be bitten of a mad dogge.
                     YE ſhall take of ſtrong chamberlie, and mixe it with bay ſalt, & ſoote of the chimney, and put therein an addle egg or two, then beate them with a ſticke altogether, and make it boyle a little, then rub the place that is bit, as hoate as yee maie wel ſuffer for ſcalding with a ſticke, & a cloute tide on the end therof. Uſe this twiſe or thriſe and he ſhal do well.
                     And this will helpe likewiſe, for other beaſts that are bit with any mad dogs.
                  
                  
                     The whole footed hogs.
                     THere is alſo a kinde of hogs in diuers places which hath whole clawes, not clouen as other hogs be. Which kinde is commonly very large of body & bigger commonly than other hogs, and the huſbandman ſaith, they are more fruitfuller than the hogs with clouen féete, & wil not lightly be mezeld. Therfore they are in many places much deſired of, rather than the other ſort. There is of them about Winſor.
                  
                  
                     Brimming of Sowes.
                     IT is not ſo good (as ſome hogheards ſaie) for any bore, to brim or couer a ſow in the night time, as in the day, for they wil not be ſo large pigs nor yet like ſo well, as thoſe which are gotten in the day.
                  
                  
                     The cauſe of ſome Rammiſh pigs.
                     YE ſhal note, if that ye put and ſtall a bore in any ſtie, if ye put in young pigs into the ſame ſty: ſoone after, all

thoſe pigs wil taſte rammiſh, like a Bore pigge to be eaten.
                  
                  
                     To kill Magots.
                     IF Magots doe bréede in the eares of hogs after the byting of dogs, or by any other occaſiō of their bodies, or likewiſe any other beaſt, ye ſhall take but honye, and put it in that place, and al the magots there wil dye, or els auoyde incontinent, if they liue. Well proued.
                  
                  
                     Another for the ſame.
                     IF magots bréede in the eare of a hog, or other beaſt, or in any hollow place vnder the ſkinne, ye ſhal take the iuice of hemlocke, and poure it into the hole, and they wil die or auoyde, and a rotten egge, mixed with the ſaide iuice, wil do the like, or the egge alone beaten and powred in, and the egg addle, is good for the ranckline, or venom of ſome dogs tooth, after he hath bitten a beaſt, to annoint with the ſaid egge.
                  
                  
                     The ſtagger or ſtaring diſeaſe.
                     HOgs wil haue a diſeaſe called the ſtare or Stagger, he will réele and fall with his hinder legs oft, and wil put his head ſometimes ouer his trough, in eating his meate if he haue not ſoone helpe: he wil pine and die thereof. The remedie, ye ſhall ſée a harde knobbe in the roofe of his mouth like a bliſter, cut it, and let it bleed, then take the powder of lome and ſalt, and rubbe it therewith, then giue him a little piſſe and ſo he wil amend.
                  
               
               
                  
                  
                     To ſhew ſome order for the taking of Moules.
                     
                     
                        FOrſomuch as I haue heeretofore ſhewed the order and gouernement of hogs, I wil not here let paſſe, but ſomewhat I wil ſhew of the taking of moules, which is a beaſt that annoyeth the grounds of huſbandmen very muche, and hauing ye property to dig and caſt within the grounde, as the other hogs on the grounde, & thereby they may be called a kind of hogs, which may be eaten alſo. Theſe kind be ſo hurtful to groundes, that they will in ſhort ſpace deface and ſpoyle any faire medowe or other ground, if they be let alone, in caſting vp hilles both in medes and all paſture grounds. And likewiſe in your corne fieldes, in raiſing the errable and ſowed groundes, that your corne can take no roote in thoſe places, and in feeding alſo of the ſaide rootes of corne, and making therewith their neſtes in the ſpring time, as I haue ſéene. There is no grounde voyde but they will ſoone finde it out, although it be compaſſed with water, for they wilſwim as well as other hogges ouer the water. And come into Gardens, Orchardes, and houſes: and becauſe that huſbandes with manie other haue the gouernment of ſuche groundes, and doe not well know the order and taking of them, whereby manie are hurt in then grounds and greatly hindered by them, in lacking ye knowledge therof how to take them. Therfore I haue here taken vpon me to ſhew ſomewhat of that order and taking of them, ſo farre as I haue knowen and vnderſtand by others, as ſhall appeare in their places.
                  
                  
                     
                     To take moules caſting in plaines.
                     WHereas moules do caſt commonly in plaines, medes and ſuch like, if ye ſhould there take them in trenches, ye ſhould ſpill much ground in breaking the vpper part thereof. Therefore as ſome do ſay, the better way is, where ye ſée them caſt
                           •
                        , goe thereunto lightly and very ſoftly, but go not on the wind ſide betwéene them and the wind: For they wil ſoone vent, and heare if ye ſtamp on the ground, in coming ſoftly be ready with your mole ſtaffe to ſtrike at the firſt or ſecond putting vp the earth, and ſtrike it with your tines downe right, and marke which way the earth falles maſt, if ſhe caſt towardes you, then ſtrike ſomewhat ouer. If ſhe caſt vp toward your right hand, then ſtrike ſomewhat on the left, and ſo of the other contrary to her caſting vppe. And by this meanes ye ſhall be alwaies the more likely to ſtrike her. In plaine ground ſtrike downe right, and when ye haue ſo ſtriken downe with your tines of your ſtaffe, yee ſhall ſo let them remaine in the earth. Then plucke out the thong in the ſtaffe that holdes the graines, and then take of your ſtaffe, and with the ſpittle or flat ende thereof, digge round about your graines vnto the endes thereof, and there ye ſhall ſée if ye haue ſtriken her or not: But if ye haue myſt her, leaue the hole open and go a little aſide, and poſſibly ſhe will ſoone come againe to ſtop the ſaid hole, and then ſtrike at her againe. For a mole loues not greatly to haue the aire. Or els as ſoone as ye haue ſtriken and miſt her, if her hole go downward, ye ſhall poure into the hole a gallon of water by and by, and thereby ſometimes ſhe will come out againſt the water, for feare of drawning, and ſo ye may take them aliue or kill them. By this meanes yee may take many the ſooner, and ſaue your groundes from ſpoiling, in taking a little paines, in watching the times of their going forth in the morning to féed, and alſo at other times coming home, when they haue fed.
                  
                  
                     
                     How to take moules after the plough.
                     TO take moules after the plough: Some huſbands do teach vs thus, ye muſt prepare a ſledde or dray, with a great veſſell ful of water thereon, and haue it at your landes endes where yee plow, and then let one go euer after the plow, and where ye ſee any moule holes newly caſt, being opened with a plow, ye ſhall poure therein your pitchards of water, and by and by ye ſhall ſee the moule (if ſhe cannot flye) come out againſt the water, and ſo ye maye then kill them. And thus ye maye alſo deſtroy many moules in your crable landes: which being let alone they will do you much harme, both in eating the rootes, and ſtalkes of your tender corne, and to make their neſts there within the ſpring time. Alſo when as the moules do caſt in your corne landes, in the ſpring time, or at other times: the beſt way is thē to make your trenches, and ſo to take them, as after ſhalbe ſhewed more plainely.
                  
                  
                     How to take moules that run ſhallow in the ground.
                     TO take them whē they run ſhallow is commonly in the ſpring time, and at other times of the yeare after a raine when the ground is ſoft, but in the ſpring time ſpecially, as in March, and Aprill. Then the moules will runne moſt aboue and digge verie ſhallow in the ground: and will worke ſo a long ſpace, by banke ſides and in the wrodtes of cartes: and where ye ſhall ſee anye ſuch newly wrought, yee ſhall but tread it downe all along ſoftly, and then watch at her accuſtomed houres when ſhe cometh abroad, and ye ſhal ſee her worke and ſturre vp the earth in the ſaid trench. Thus ye maye go from trench to trench. They will commonly worke earely in the morning, and in the ſpring betwéene ſixe a clocke and eight, and at a leauen, and in the after

noone, about three or foure, and ſome time at ſeuen a clocke.
                     Then muſt ye watch diligently, and hearken, and ye ſhal either heare her worke in the ground, or elſe ye ſhall ſee her moue the earth in the trench where ſhe goeth and cometh. Then ſhall ye choppe downe your broad end of your ſtaffe croſſe the hole behind her, and with your foote before her, ſo ſtoppe the way behind with your ſtaffe, and before with your foot, and ſo to take her vp with your ſpittle. For if ye ſtoppe not firſt her way behind, ſhe will ſodainely runne as faſt backward as ſhe will forward, and ſo will paſſe out at the ende ſhe came in, if it be open ſhe will bolte out thereat, and in at another, and ſo ye may ſoone come to looſe her.
                     Therefore ſome do thinke it better to do this, that when yee ſhall ſee her in any ſuch ſhallowe trench being troden downe, then ſhe muſt make ſtill her waie forward: Then looke where ye ſee her, ſuffer her to come forward well in the trench, before ye ſtoppe her way: then do no more but chop your moule ſpade, croſſe behind your ſtaffe, with your foot, and then take and caſt her vp.
                  
                  
                     How to take moules in buſh groundes, and alſo other groundes, as foreſt, parkes, and ſuch.
                     THe beſt taking of moules in rough groundes and moſt ſureſt waye is, to make trenches and take them therein, as thus: whereas yee do ſee any moule hath newlye caſt, yee ſhall there make a trench foure inches broade, and ſo long as ye thinke good, and there open the earth on both ſides, and caſt it vppe, ſo deepe as ſhe hath gone. Then make it fine and choppe it ſmall and put thereof in agayne and tread it downe ſoftly with your foote in the trench, but not to hard vppon it, for ſo yee maye cauſe

her to forſake the ſaid trench, when it is troden downe to hard, and ſhe will then take ſome other way. Thus ye muſt vſe your trenches, in making ſo manye as yee ſhall thinke good in what ground ye will: ye maie make your trenches of what length ye liſt, from a foot to foure foot long. So done. Then muſt ye take ſome paines (as afore ſaid) in watching their houres when they come abroad, which (as I haue ſaid) is commonly in the morning by ſunne riſing or ſoone vpon. And in March, and Aprill, they will be coming home by 8. or 9. a clocke, and ſometimes about a 11. a clocke, and they wil come abroad againe about 3. or 4. a clocke at after noone. Thus ye muſt watch and marke in each ground, what time they do vſe to come and go.
                     Alſo in drie and hot weather a mole will ſeldome come abroad, but in the morning, and ſo remaine til the next morning. But againſt moiſt wether, or after a raine, they will come moſt abroad twiſe a day, before and after noone: and they will worke very much, if the ground bee not to moiſt: and in froſtie weather then they cannot worke abroad, but they worke vnder the roots of trées, and in thick hedges and buſhes.
                  
                  
                     How to know their ſuccours.
                     IN winter and wet times, they will lye moſt in drie banks of hedges, in hils, and vnder rootes of trées, and will come from thence euery morning to féed, and go abroad (if it bee drie) x. or xii. ſcore of from their holdes, and when they haue fed an houre or two, they will returne home againe. Then muſt ye marke where they haue béene, and there make your trenches, or chop the earth down (with your ſpittle or broad ende of your mole ſtaffe) which ſhe hath raiſed before and paſt through: there tread it downe with your foot in your trenches ſo long as they be, or ſo far as ſhe hath raiſed the earth, and the longer ye make your trenches, the longer ſhe will be in paſſing through when ſhee comes into it. Yee may make and place your trenches where yee ſhall thinke

beſt in the groundes. If ye make your trench nie their holds, it ſhall do beſt to take them in going out, or coming home, For there you ſhall be moſt ſure to haue them. If a field be viii. or x. acres, ye maie make therin ſo many trenches as ye ſhal ſéeme good: along by the hedges ſide or nie the banks and rootes of trees ſhall be beſt: For there ſhall ye ſooneſt take them.
                     Alſo where as you make your trenches far aſunder, while perhaps ye go to one, they will paſſe through an other, and ſo for that time eſcape, if ye haue no helpe but your ſelfe, yee ſhall ſo looſe manie. The beſt waie therfore is, when ye haue troden downe your trenches with your foot ſoftlie, then yee ſhall pricke white ſmall twigs at the endes of your ſaid trē
                        ches, and pricke them ſo ſhallow, that they maie fall by a little mouing of the earth when the mole is in the trench: and by thoſe falling ye ſhall ſée being a good way of when ſhe is in the trench. Then ye maie come ſoftly (on the lie ſide) and chop downe your mole ſpade croſſe behind her, and thruſt downe the earth with your foot there behind your ſpade, and then take your mole ſpade and caſt her vp: For ſometimes ſhe will lie ſtill, when ſhe ſées ſhe cannot go awaie. If your trenches be ſhort, ye maie pricke a wand in the mids therof, which will ſhew when ſhe is halfe through, which wandes are cald watches, for they will tell you when ſhe is in the trench. This way ye maie take them moſt ſureſt in trenches in all places where ye ſhall thinke good. Then tread downe your trench againe, and ſo ye maie take diuers one after an other in one trench.
                  
                  
                     How to know in the ſpring, the neſtes, where moules do breede.
                     YE ſhall vnderſtand (as ſome farmers do ſaie) moles do bréed but once a yeare, and that is in the ſpring: about March, and Aprill, they go to bucke, and commonlie about S. Markes daie they do kindle, and will haue young.
                     Therfore from mid March, ye ſhall view your groundes,

where ye may ſée anye great and high hils, for commonly there they will breede, which hils ye ſhall ſée, both of old and new caſt, & commonly they which are new caſt, they make their neſts in the mids thereof very low, much like the field mouſe, and ſome will make them in the hedge ſides, and in buſhes: ſome in plaine fieldes viii. ſcore from any buſh or hedge, caſting a great hill as bigge as two barrow ſtils. And if ye then let them alone till the end of Aprill, ſoone after S. Markes day, ye may then poſſibly take all the young in the neſt, and then after ye may watch the trench for their dam, for ſhe wil come vnto them to ſéeke them.
                     Alſo ye may trench for the female about her neſt, a prety way of, and ſo ye may poſſibly take her, in coming and going to her neſt, before ſhe do kindle: For if ye ſpoile her neſt, before he haue kindled, ſhe wil then go farre of and bréede in ſome other place, which ye ſhall hardly find, or come to take her, and then when ſhe hath young, ſhe wilbe very ſubtill for to take, & ſhe will beat her young from place to place, & will not ſuffer them to bolte nor yet worke ſhallow: Therefore, it will be the more harder to take them, and ſhe will cōmonly haue at a time vi. or vii. young.
                     Likewiſe all the winter, they wil caſt againſt moiſt weather very much: both in Nouember, and December being wet and warme withal: and becauſe the daies are ſhort, and the nightes long, they will be ſturring very early in the morning ſometimes before day light, and late toward night. Therefore ye muſt watch their times accordingly whē they go out and come home againe.
                  
                  
                     Moules to be driuen from place to place.
                     THere be ſome which haue ſaid, ye may driue moules out of one ground into another, & there to take them, which is, ye ſhall open their holes whereas they haue newly caſt, & then ye ſhall haue ſtampt garlicke ready wrapt in cloutes of linnen, and ſo put into their holes, made of the bignes of a walnut, and put ſo into the holes at both the open ends therof,

and couer the holes againe, and the ſtrong ſauor thereof will cauſe the moules to void from thoſe places: and by ſuch meanes (in vſing the holes as afore ſaid) ye may driue them from one ground to another, and from place to place. Some do vſe tarre, ſome lawrell, ſome galwoort or elder ſtampt, ſome gabanum fumed in holes, or any ſuch ſtrong thing of ſa
                           ••
                        or, which will cauſe them to fly from thence or thoſe places ſo fumed, and euer where ye ſee her worke, ſtill fume that place, and ſo yee ſhall ſoone driue them away.
                  
                  
                     How to take moules in pots, ſet in the earth.
                     THey do teach alſo how to take moules in pots of earth, which pots ye ſhall ſet within the ground in their traces or holles where they haue gone before, ſo that your pots brinke muſt ſo be ſet, that it be euen with the nether part of the trench or trace of the moule. Some do couer the pots with turfes of earth: but let there bee no more of the pots brim vncouered, but the bredth of her trace in the trēch or two inches. Some do vſe to put a liue moule into thoſe pots, or into ech pot one: For when they do gender (in the ſpring) the buckes will hunt after the doaes, and the doaes will ſeeke the buckes, and then they will runne about on the ground one after the other. And thoſe moules which are in pots and cannot come out wil cry, and the reſt will heare & wind them, and ſo fall vnto them in the pots, and there they wil crie and fight together.
                     Againe ſome do counſell in the gendring time to lead or draw a bich moule with a ſtring about the ground where the pots are ſet, and ſo put her into one of your pots, and the bucke moules will find her out by the trace, and ſo take in the ſaid pots, but ye muſt not tread nie her trare, for thē they wil not follow her: And by this meanes ye may take manye in the ſpring time with pots.

And to know which way a mole hath gone, ye ſhal opē her trench a foot or more, & then tread it light down with your foot, and in the 
                           ••
                        ds of her trench ye ſhal ſet down a ſmall ſticke to the bottom of her trench, and let your ſticke be three inches without the earth or more. If ſhe come in, the top of ye ſticke wil fal backware, and if ſhe go out, the ſticke will fall inward. Thus may ye know which way ſhe is gone. Again I haue hard, in a garden where as the earth is ſoft, yt when the mole doth eaſt, at the ſecond putting vp he wil thruſt in his bare hand and ſo take them vp. Alſo, where as you ſhall ſée moles to make their paſſage vnder the earth in woods, & rough groundes, in croſſing foot pathes, or betwene buſhes, bankes, and ſuch: where ye ſhal ſée any ſuch earth caſt vp: there commonly they haunt to go and come daily, wherin ye ſhal do no more but tread that earth ſoftly downe with your foot, or chop it down with your mole ſtaffe and ſo tread with your foot downe ſoftly againe, and make your trenchſo long as ye may feele eaſily her paſſage. For the longer it is trode down, the longer they wilbe in paſſing through: ſo there ye need make no other trenches to take them in, but thoſe, For this order ſhal do as wel as néed, if ye watch their times.
                     Thus ye may diſtroy them in woods, and rough grounds in a ſmal time with taking ſome paine. And when a mole is in the trench, & doth worke, if it be hard trode down, ſhe wil go backe and come againe once or twiſe, & perhaps forſake it. But let her come a good way in the trench, then clappe your ſtaffe, or chop your héele behind her quickly, and thē caſt her vp: for they wil lightly turne back, if they wind you, or heare you ſtampe. Moreouer if ye can bring vp a curre, to go with you when ye take them, & ſo to noſill him therewith, he will then take pleaſure in killing them, and hee will find in any ground three moles againſt your one. For he will ſmel and ſhew you where the mole is, which thing I haue ſéene going by the way ſide. There is alſo a trap to take moles in coming or going at all times: Which engine, yee may ſée in my bookes of traps and engines. Thus much for the taking of moles in all groundes.
                  
                  FINIS.
               
               
                  
                  
                     ¶ For ſo much as the dog is a very neceſſarie beaſt for the husbandman, as well as others, ſome to profit him, and ſome to diſprofit him, as mad dogs, and other, whereof I will ſomewhat ſpeake briefly, and ſo make an ende.
                     
                        I In houndes and dogs which fall madde, the cauſe is, the burnt choler hath the maſtrie in his body: which choler being once roſted in them through vehement heat, it ouercometh the bodie, and maketh him to run mad. For the black choller which is ſo ſtrong, it fumeth vppe in his head, infecteth the braine, and ſo from thence goeth to all the other members and maketh them venemous.
                     Therefore if any perſon be bit with a madde dogge, it is the venemous ſpittle of the dogges heat that doth infect: And the venome of him which doth bite, is drawne to the like place wherewith he biteth, which is the braine, and there it worketh and maketh the dogge runne mad, and if he bite any other perſon, it maketh him mad alſo: and ſuch venome is perilous. For in ſome perſons it is a yeare hid or it be knowne, and lightly about the ſame day it was bitten, the ſame day twelue moneth it cometh vnto his head; and therewith he goeth madde, and commonly houndes wil barke at a madde dogge, for they perceiue, and wil rather fly him, then to come to him: and this madnes among dogges, chaunceth and falleth moſt in harueſt, and canicular daies, and daies of heat.
                     His tongue is ſo venemous that it maketh him to reele and ſtagger, and to runne about gaping and driueling in holding downe his tayle alwaies, and hanging out his tongue. If his driueling fall into anye water, it infecteth the ſame, and who ſo drinketh thereof, is in great daunger

of being mad.
                     And the ſignes after the biting of a mad dog in a man is: They ſhall haue in their ſleepe feareful dreames and ſights, and anger without cauſe, and they will ſéeme to barke like a dog, and feareth to be ſéene of others: And they feare water moſt, and be very daintie in all thinges, which are doubtfull ſignes to cure. For of him that is bitten, the venome goeth from the bitten place to the heart, & from thence to the head, and ſo to all members as aforeſaid: and the humour is more moiſt and perilous. And it is alſo daungerous to touch thoſe bodies infected, becauſe the vaporation and vehemencie of the venome, and they will corrupt all thinges néere vnto them.
                     Note alſo, that if venome be taken by meates or drinkes, theſe ſignes do follow, the crampe followeth very ſtrongly, with ſwelling in the fingers and nailes, which is a deadlye ſigne. Or if he alſo gape, and driuell, his lippes do ſmart and tingle, or féele a heat in his tongue, without any ſwelling & being vexed ſtraitly about the heart, his eies waxe dim and dark. Whē theſe ſignes are, it is time to make haſt, or death cometh ſoone after.
                     The generall remedy and medicine is to vomit, or to take a gliſter to bring it downe. Then take of triacle, and wine that Sowthiſtle is ſodde in: Then muſt he be purged, and bathed, and let bloud at the laſt. And his diet ſhall be fatte meates, with fulbards er ſmall nuts, with drie figges, which is alſo good to draw, conſume and waſt venome. Balſamum with womans milke helpeth againſt the burning and ſore ach thereof. Triacle forti
                           •
                        eth the body, and waſteth venome. If triacle cannot be gotten, then take garlicke ſod in broth with a fatte henne, and drinke thereof, for garlick is contrarie to venome, and doth aſwage the inner burning thereof, and therefore it is cald, the huſbandmans triacle.
                     Alſo if one be bitten with a mad dog, take a cock or a hen, and kil him, and ſlit him ſtraight, and all hotte clappe it to the place, and it will ſucke & draw out the venome. The

drawers of venowe are theſe, the fleſh of a ſnake, or adder, cut and laid to ſtraight. Alſo calamint, the ſéede of wilde tares, cald orobancke. Sea onions, water creſſes, hearbe grace, ſalt, Ariſtolochia nuts eate with rue, the roots of a ſperage & the ſéed alſo. Balſamum, dinegar, & the milke of an aſſe, a childes piſſe, the ſtones of a hedgehog, the ſtones of a ſtagge, or an aſſe, dride and drunk. Alſo caſtoreum, garlicke, gencian, mint, dittan. All theſe afore ſaid are good againſt venome, and others without number: and although the danger of venome cometh many and ſundry waies: therfore God of his goodnes hath prouided ſundry helpes and remedies. A good way to helpe the biting of any beaſt, ſhéep or other, with a mad dog, or other venemous beaſt, Which is, ye ſhal cut the wound and make it to bléed, that the venome with the bloud may thereby come forth. Some do vſe to put to lech wormes, to ſucke out the bloud, and to cuppe or boxe it, and to giue them triacle, and lay to the woundes plaiſters, as nuts mixt with garlicke, rue and ſalt all together, and alſo nuts alone chewed and laide to the place, and alſo triacle with water, of creues of the riuer made in pouder, and drunke: or the aſhes of the ſaid creuis with gentian, is a ſingular remedie againſt the byting of a mad dogge. Likewiſe the iuice of capriſolium, called woodbind. Alſo the leaues of the wilde figge trée: onions and ſalt, or mint ſtampt like wiſe with ſalt, and laide to, euerie one of theſe aforeſaid laide to, and mixt with vineger or hony, are ſufficient to helpe againſt the byting of a Mad dogge, or ſtinging of other venomous wormes: but a perfect remedie is, the oyle wherein a Scorpion hath beene drowned, and therein alſo is ſod, and thereof a peece laide to the place infected, doth helpe.
                     Other remedies againſt the byting of a mad dogge. A ſinguler remedie, which is, to burne the flowers of hany ſuckles, or thrée leaued graſſe, mixe it with elde greace, and laye it to: Or to beate the ſaide flowers with olde white wine, and giue it him. Alſo the rootes of eglintine made in pouder and laide thereon: or to make him a

drinke it with good olde white wine. Another: the horſes of elder, or the iuyce of the leaues to bee giuen with wine luke warme. Alſo the iuyce of plantaine giuen to drinke, or ſtampt with ſalte and laid to. Or the roote of the great burre bruſed with a little ſalte and laide to, doth deſtroye venome incontinent. Againe, the ſtrong nettle bruſed with ſalt, and laid thereon. Or ſelandine, drunke with wine, and ſtampt with ſalt and laid to. Or the leaues of horehound ſtampt and laid to with ſalte. All theſe are ſpeciall good againſt the biting of a mad dogge. If a madde dogge do bite other houndes or hogges, ye ſhall giue them the iuice of plantaine, and let them bloud, and it will helpe them, but mixe it with a little milke, and ſo giue it.
                  
                  
                     Remedies and medicines to helpe mangy dogs, as well in their eares, as alſo other partes of their bodies.
                     
                        IN ſommer commonly the eares of dogs are ſore troubled with vlcers, ſcabbes, and fleaſe, that many are marde therby. The remedy is againſt the ſcabbines in the eare, annoint it with oile of bitter almands, and it will heale it: or to rub his eare with bitter almands ſmally beaten, but if his eares are ſore within, ye ſhall then mixe therwith tarre, and hogges greaſe, and with the ſame do annoint, and ye ſhall make the ticks and lice to fall, if ye touch them therewith: ye muſt not ſcratch them with your hand, for feare ye make an vlcer riſe thereof.
                     If a dogge haue fleaſe, the remedy is: take of beaten cummin, with as much ellebory, and mixe them together with water, and waſh him therewith: or with the iuice of wilde cowcumbers, if ye haue none thereof, then annoint all ouer his body with the lies and old dregs of oile oliue.
                     But if he be mangie and brokē forth, ye muſt beat y• teaues of mellilot, & ſeſtamine, in like portion mingled with tarre, & ſo annoint: and this they ſay is good for men alſo that

are ſcabbed, & if the ſcabs be yet more vehemēt, ye may heale it with the iuyce of the Cedar. Alſo rue with a corne or two of ſalt, & beat them together, then take butter or oyle & put therevnto, and ſtirre them wel altogether, then ſtraine it all out, and annoynt therwith, or ſéeth the gréene rootes of Elecampane in running water, and make it ſtrong of the rootes in ſée thing long, and put ſome ſope & ſalt therevnto, & waſh your dogge therewith warme 3. or 4. dares together, and it will heale very well.
                     Alſo another, ſome take gréene graſſe & beates it into fine pouder, & mixe it with the powder of brimſtone, finely beaten together, and then al wel hurt with freſh greace, & then made hot, and therewith annoint. Alſo another very perfect and good medicine is, yee ſhal take an oate ſheafe as it come from the field with his afles theron, and burne him to aſhes, and with thoſe aſhes make lye, and therewith waſhe your mangie dog twiſe or thriſe a day, and it wil helpe, often proued: and to let him blood on the gamarel vaine behinde.
                     Alſo another very excellēt medicine to kil any itch, either in man or dog, which is, ye ſhal take a portiō of oyle of flower deluce, with a good quantitie of brimſtone beaten to a fine powder, and the like quantitie of Elecampane rootes dried in an ouen, and beate into a fine powder, with a quantitie of bay ſalt, dried and beaten to a fine powder, then mixe all theſe foreſaide powders with the ſaid oyle, and then warm it ouer the fire, and annoynt therewith. But if ye ſcratte or make the ſkin firſt to bléed or water, and then to annoint, it wil do the better. Wel and often proued. Another, for a magie dogge. Take quickſiluer, Uerdegreace, Wooloyle, brimſtone powder, then mixe all well together, and therewith annoynt the dog twiſe a day. Thus much for the byting of mad dogs in helping the ſame. And alſo helpes for mangie dogs.
                     A bitch goeth with whelpe foureſcore dayes, and her whelpes are ſeuen daies blind, not perfit ſight till 21. daies, and a grayhound bitch goeth 6. wéekes with whelpe, her whelpes are blind twelue daies.
