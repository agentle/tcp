                  She hath ſpoke enough to make me conuertine.

                  Adam.
                  Marry thus prodigall, to frequent ordinaries is his ordinarie practiſe, rubs out whole weekes together in bowling. Allyes, bandies away his pocket full of French-Crownes in a morning, and counts it a prettie ſport to procure heate.

                  Thinke as you will ſir, there's not a tricke vſde in the towne that deſerues damnation, but hee deſires to deale in't, tis pitty a was not made a tradeſman, he loves to follow his occupation a life, & that which makes him doubt moſt, he is in loue with the Indian punck Tobacco.

                  I thinke none a the name lout's it,

I haue heard olde Adam was an honeſt man, and a good Gardiner lou'd Lettice well, Sallets and Cabbage reaſonable well, yet no Tobacco: Again, Adam Bell a ſubſtantial out-law, & paſſing a good Archer, yet no Tobaconiſt. Further, Diogenes, whoſe propper name might bee Adam for ought I know, lou'd Carretts well, Leeke porredge▪ paſſing well, yet no Tobacco: to conclude, my great Grandfathers Grandfathersfather, and my ſelfe all Gardners, yet could not abide this Chimney-ſweeper Tocauſe, bacco.
