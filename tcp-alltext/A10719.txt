TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, THE EARLE of Sariſbury, Lord High Treaſurer of England.
            
            
               BEING willing (moſt Honourable) in the ſight of the world, to leaue ſome publicke teſtimonie of my humble duty towards God, of my faithfull ſeruice towards his Maieſtie, and of my vnfeigned good will to that infortunate Countrey of Ireland, that hath beene ſo fauourably dealt withall, firſt by the milde & merciful allurements of our late Queene of moſt happy memorie, that was a louing Nurſe, nay rather a kinde mother, that did ſtill carke and care for them, with ſuch compaſſionate loue & kindneſſe, that ſhe neglected nothing that was either fitting for a Prince to beſtow of ſubiects, or behoouefull for ſubiects to receiue from the Prince: And now againe, hath not this loue, this care, & thiS clemencie been ſtil continued vnto them, by the bleſſed and peaceable gouernment of our gratious

King, and what is the concluſion, the people were neuer more froward, neuer more obſtinate, neuer more peruerſe, nor the ſtate of that kingdome, neuer more deſperate then it is at this houre, confuſed as well in the true knowledge appertayning vnto God, as in their duetie and obedience belonging to their Prince, where the people are daily ſeduced, infected and peruerted by Ieſuites, Seminaries & other runnagate Prieſts the miniſters of Antichriſt, wherwith the Country doth ſwarme, and haue ſo mightily preuailed, that they haue wrought a generall contempt, aſwell againſt his Maieſtie himſelfe, as againſt his godly proceedings.
            And theſe be they that haue ſo abuſed and blinded the zeale of many good people, which otherwiſe without all queſtion would bee more confirmable in the knowledge and loue or GOD, and in their obedience and duetie towards their Prince: but ſo many ſeducing ſpirits are planted in all the parts of that Realme, that if there be one that wil ſtand for the King, there is twentie for that one to maintaine the Pope.
            But it will bee ſaid, why theſe are no nouelties, all this is well enough knowne to bee true, and what may I either doe or ſay in a matter that

ſo many learned men haue already dealt withall? that ſo many wiſe men haue had to doe withall, and ſo many politicke men haue ſo often vndertaken, and could neuer performe either meane to redreſſe or amend it. I confeſſe my learning is none at all, & therefore I will not meddle with thoſe matters that are aboue my reach: my wiſedome I acknowledge no more then my learning, and yet I hope it ſhall ſuffice to diſcouer a trueth in this matter that I haue vndertaken: with policie I will not meddle, neither is it for mee to deale wihall: but eſpecially with that policie that belongeth to matters of eſtate I will not ſo much as looke after, yet I would bee glad to put in a helping hand: it is little that I can doe, yet hee doth well that doth ſomething.
            The diuell is not idle, and his Apoſtles doe neither ſlippe time, nor omit occaſion: the Pope beſtirres him with his Bulles, with his Indulgences, with his Pardons, with his Prieſts, with his Ieſuites, with his Miniſters of all ſorts and of all profeſſions: that are ſtill conſpiring that are ſtill peruerting, that are ſtill ſeducing in euery corner, in the Country, in the Towne, in the Cittie, perhaps in the Court▪ what, ſhall we not encounter them? (or at the leaſt) ſhall wee

not diſcouer them what they be, to whom they belong, and what they indeauour? But they will ſay, I am no diuine, and it is trueth. I am no ſcholler, and that is true too: what am I then? I am a Souldier, a profeſſed ſouldier, better practiſed in my pike then in my penne: and may not a Souldier indeuour himſelfe for the glorie of his God, for the ſeruice of his King, & for the good of his Country? may not a Soldier vphold that religion either by word or writing, that hee muſt maintaine and defend with the price of his bloode? is there any man to impugne this? if not, I hope my vnlettered diligence ſhall not be miſconſtrued, that, knowing the ſtate and condition of that miſerable & wretched Realme of Ireland, where ſo many good people of all ſorts are ſo cortinually ſeduced and abuſed by the Popes factors, I haue therefore collected and gathered this little treatiſe, wherein (according to the trueth teſtified in the holy Scriptures) I haue not onely vnmasked this broode of the generation of Antichriſt, but I haue likewiſe ſo pluckt the viſard from the Pope himſelfe, that he might ſo appeare in his owne likeneſſe, that neither his fatherly lookes, nor his counterfeit ſhew of grauitie, nor that holie holie holineſſe where with he hath ſo long diſguiſed himſelfe, ſhall be able to deceiue

any man (bee he neuer ſo ſimple) that will but vouchſafe to reade, and to beleeue but that which is teſtified by the word of the liuing God.
            And here againe it will bee ſaid, that all this hath beene already performed by ſeuerall learned and worthy men: but ſhall wee therefore leaue the field to the foe, becauſe wee haue already giuen him a conflict? ſhall wee not incounter him to day, to morrowe and euery day, that is continually bragging & brauing of vs? that is ſtil aſſailing vs with freſh ſupplies? that is ſtill leuying of new forces to ſet vpon vs? that is ſtill incroching, and neuer giues ouer to ſend his Agents, not by one, or by two, or by tenne, but by hundreds, and by thouſands, and ſhall we not incounter him, but ſuffer him thus to draw away the harts of the ſubiects, from the duetie and obedience they owe to their ſoueraignes, as they haue done and are daily practiſing in Ireland? nay ſhall wee ſuffer him, (without contradiction) to leade ſo many poore ſoules to deſtruction? For although all manner of ſinnes did neuer ſo much abound, as they doe at this preſent, yet, of my conſcience, the Pope himſelfe doth ſend more ſoules to hell, and the diuell is more beholding to the Pope alone, then to all the reſt of thoſe vgly monſters, that are called by the name of the ſeuen deadly ſinnes.
            
               
Lo here a matter of chriſtian re morſe, & ſhall we not now put to our helping hands on al ſides to diſcouer this monſter? ſhall we ſay it is a ſuperfluous matter to reiterate any thing that may lay him open to the viewe of the world, that with his counterfeit ſhew of holyneſſe hath deceiued the whole world, and hath ſent ſo many millions of Chriſtian ſoules to the pit of perdition?
            What I haue indeuored herein (I hope) will neither be thought to be vnneceſſary, nor deemed to bee altogether vnprofitable: yet the rather to countenance both it and me, I haue with all humbleneſſe preſumed to offer them to your honour, to you whom God hath indued with the ſpirit of his trueth: being ſo much the rather incouraged with hope of a fauourable acceptance, knowing your godly diſpoſition to be ſo zealouſly inclined to the true worſhipping of God.
            If my lines be not anſwerable to your exquiſite iudgement, I doe then tender them to your honourable curteſie, that was yet neuer knowne to deſpiſe any mans indeuour that was honeſtly intended; but if they fall out (as I haue ment them) for the aduancement of Gods glorie, why then they belong to your Honour as your owne proper right, whom God hath aduanced for the ſetting forth of his glorie, and hath giuen you both

heauenly wiſedome and worldly honour, that you might continue (as hitherto you haue done) a principal inſtrument for the vpholding of the Goſpell.
            Pleaſeth it your honour to accept of it, as an office and ſeruice of good intent: and although from a ſouldiers pen, yet as the earneſt peny of a faithfull heart, that hath beene (and is) alwaies conſecrated to do your Lordſhip all humble and dutiful ſeruice, and ſo in the like dutiful maner will reſt.
            
               Your honors in all bumblenes to be commanded, BARNABE RICHE.
            
         
         
            
            To the curteous and well diſpoſed reader, eſpecially of Ireland, and to all other that haue diſcreti
               on, firſt to reads, and then to iudge.
            
            
               IT may be there are ſome will thinke it ſtrange that a man of my profeſsion ſhould deale in theſe cauſes: Vnbefitting (they will ſay) for a ſouldier to meddle with all. But if there be any ſuch who doth not know it to be lawfull for any man that is a Chriſtian, and truly proſeſſing Chriſt (of whatſoeuer calling otherwiſe he be) may not indeuour himſelfe for the glory of God, or the aduancement of the Goſpell; I will rather pray for that man, then take vpon me to anſwere him. The matter that I haue vndertakē, is to diſcouer the Pope, to make him knowne, and ſo to lay him open to the viewe of euery diſcreete reader, that he might no longer deceiue that he that is not wilfully blinde may be made able to diſcerne betweene light and darkeneſſe, to iudge of trueth & falſehood, to knowe the voyce of Christ calling to ſaluation, and to ſhune the waies of Antichriſt leading to destruction that this rablement of Ieſuites & Seminaryes, and the rest of that viperous brood, ſhold not be ſo eaſily able to ſeduce, that haue already ſobewitched & infected that infortunate country of Ireland, that ignorance is ioyned with obſtynacy, that blindnes is coupled with malice, that wilfull opinion is holden for the teſtimony of a good conſcience, where he that is moſt peruerſe, is accounted for moſt Catholique, & to conclude, where Chriſt is deſpiſed, and Antichriſt is aduanced.
            To the end therefore that this man of ſin, this Antichriſt I

meane (that hath beene ſo often ſpoken of, and ſo long looked for) might be diſcerned, I have gathered together what notes the holy ſcriptures do teſtifiy of him, what markes are there left vnto vs whereby we may knowe him, what pathes he ſhould tread out, and what waies he ſhould walke, whoſe ſteppes I haue vndertaken, and followed the tract directly to Rome, I haue brought it to ſaynt Peters chayre (as ſome would haue it called, and there I haue left it. Now according to the Iriſh cuſtome, when a Health is cōmitted, and the tract being followed into any part or quarter off the Country, the Lord of that place is either to put it off againe from out of his precinct, or elſe to ſtand charged with the fact, and is compelled to make a full reſtitution: thē according to this cuſtome, the tract of Antichriſt being brought to Rome, they muſt either put it off againe from out the territories, and make good proofe into what iuriſdiction they haue brought it, or elſe that holy ſeate which they ſay in times past hath been Saint Peters chaire, is now become the ſeate of Antichriſt, and the Pope is to anſwere for as much as the word of God doth expreſly charge him with, that is to ſay, of Treaſon, of murther and of theft.
            Firſt of Treaſon against the most Highest whoſe lawes, couenants ſeales and ſacraments, he hath not only clipped, counterfeited, chopped and changed▪ but he hath alſo ſet vp other Gods of his owne making, which he cauſeth to be worſhipped honoured and adored.
            For a murtherer, who hath euer heard of a more cruell and mercileſſe butcher, aſwell againſt the Saints and ſeruants of God whom he perſecuteth with ſword, with fire and with all maner of tortures, wherewith hee tormenteth them to a temporall death, but likewiſe ſendeth infinite thouſands of the miſerable ſoules (that doe aſſie and trust in him) with

his Indulgences, Bulles and pardons, to eternall death & danation.
            Now for felony, what more notable theft then to rob God of that glory that is proper to himſelfe? and yet not contented with that, but he hathrobbed vs of the holy scriptures left vnto vs by the holy Ghoſt to be our comfort & ſauing health, & wherin we are to ſearch the very myſterie of our ſaluatiō. Our ſauiour ſent the Scribs and Phariſes to ſearch the ſcriptures though they were but hypocrites, and ſought dayly to erucify Chriſt, but the Pope forbiddeth Chriſtian men once to looke on them, though they be baptized and haue receiued Chriſt.
            Are the ſcriptures medicynable to the bad, and vehemous to the good? and more perylous to him that will belieue in Chriſt, then to him that will crucify Chriſt?
            They vaunted of their father Abraham, and their ſitting in Moſes chayre, as the papiſt doth now of his holy father the Pope, and his ſitting in Peters chayre: yet Chriſt pronounced woe againſt them for ſhutting vp the key of knowledge, which was by giuing a falſe ſenſe, by wrong interpreting the ſcriptures: but it is not found that they prohibited or forbad any man to read thē, as the Pope & his ſhauelings are accuſtomed.
            What I haue iudeuoured herein, I haue done it in compaſſion: for if there be any commiſeration to be had of thoſe that walke in darkeneſſe, and ſit in the ſhadowe of death▪ the poore people of Ireland are to be pittied; and not onely they alone, but as many other, what, or wherſoeuer, that are thus ſeduced and blinded by the miniſters of the Prince of darkeneſse.
            If thou with like fauour and curteſie will vouchſafe to peruſe it as I haue honeſtly ment it, cenſure it then & ſpare not: & thus repoſing my ſelfe on thy charitable diſpoſition, I reſt.
         
      
      
         
            
            A ſhort ſuruey of Ireland.
            
               CHAP. I.
               A deſcription of the Countrey, with the maners, cuſtomes and diſpoſitions of the people.
               
                  IT could not be impertinent in this my ſuruey of Ireland to make my firſt entry with the diſcription of the countrey, the fertilitie of the ſoile, the nature, diſpoſition and maners of the people. All which if I ſhould expreſſe according to a trueth, I might write a more admirable hiſtory, and ſpeake of greater wonders, then either ſir Iohn Mandiuyll in his trauell, or any other that haue paſſed the moſt vncouth places of the world are able truely to report.
               And here is the matter eſpecially to bee admired, that a countrey ſcituate and ſeated vnder ſo temperate a Climate, that is neither oppreſſed with extremitie, either of cold in the winter, or with heate in the ſummer, that is inuironed with England, Scotland, France
                  
and Spaine, that hath had continuall entercourſe, trade and trafficke, and hath beene daily conuerſant with the people of theſe nations, and the country ſhould yet remaine as it doth▪ more vnciuill, more vncleanly, more barbarous, and more brutiſh in their cuſtomes and demeanures▪ then in any other part of the world that is knowne.
               If I ſhould ſpeake what affiance they haue of Saint Patricks purgatorte, of the Holy Croſſe, and of many other places of pilgrimage frequented by Iriſh, I might deliuer ridiculous matter, not onely of the blinde zeale, and ſometimes of the vnciuill demeanure of the pilgrimes them ſelues, but alſo how they are cheated, couſined, and deceiued by their ghoſtly fathers, that for their owne lucre and gaine, doth delude themwith voices, with viſions, and with ſtrange deuiſes, more fitter to be laughed at, then to be beleiued.
               It were ſtrange to deliuer the maners which they vſe in the buriall of their dead: and he that were at Dublyne it ſelfe, and ſhould ſee a dead corps brought to the graue, would ſay, that there could not bee a more heatheniſh demeanure, no, not amongſt a people that had neither knowne nor heard of God.
               For the bleſſing which it hath pleaſed GOD to vouchſafe to that countrey, in purging it from all ſorts of wormes that are venimous or poiſonable: this benofite onely they aſcribe to ſaint Patricke, and will in no wiſe acknowledge it to be the bleſſing of God.
               I might ſpeake here of their Iriſh cuſtomes, ſtrange to be deliuered, and of their Brehon lawe, & their lawes Tameſtry, and of their Lord & Captaine called Tameſt,
                  
choſen for diuerſe conſiderations: and how amongſt thē euery great mans will & commandement is a lawe (eſpecially amongſt their owne tenants:) for Ireland hath euermore ſtriued to runne into all lawleſſe and irregular courſes, whereby they are growne into ſuch a habite of ſauage tyranny, that nothing is more pleaſing to the greateſt number of them, then ciuill warres, murthers and maſſacres, whereunto as they are commonly inclined, ſo there wants not thoſe amongſt thē to pricke them forward, and to ſtirre them vp to Treaſon and rebellion againſt their Prince, that are ſtill cō
                  ſpiring, ſtill practiſing, and ſtill indeuouring to draw them into that mortall plague of rebellion, which is not to be cured but by the ſword, by common ſlaughters and ſpilling of blood.
               And although the greateſt part of the people of that kingdome hath been from time to time thus drawne and ſtirred vp by theſe ſeducing ſpirits: yet for a number of others of that Country-birth, to whom it hath pleaſed God to vouchſafe the grace of his holy ſpirit, that I know are daily laboured and importuned by this viperous broode, aſwell to ſhake off the loue to their God, as their dutie to their Prince, for their ſakes it is that I haue endeuoured theſe lines, to giue them a Caueat to beware of theſe fire-brands of Rebellion, the which becauſe I haue deciphered in their proper colours, I will referre them to this ſequell, as it hereafter followeth.
            
            
               
               CHAP. II.
               The Diuerſitie in opinions what Antichriſt ſhould be.
               
                  THere is no man (I thinke) if he haue but very ſlenderly indeuoured himſelfe in the reading of the holy ſcriptures, but he hath found it teſtified both in the old and new teſtaments, that towards the latter daies and end of the world, Antichriſt ſhould come, who with falſe doctrine and lying mitacles ſhould ſeduce the kingdomes and nations of the earth.
               What, or who this Antichrist ſhould be, there are diuerſe ſuppoſitions, and as many fabulous coniectures haue beene deuiſed of the perſon of Antichrist, which doe rather ſeduce, then giue any certaine teſtimonie whereby we may know him.
               Some doe ſay that he ſhould be a Iewe, of the tribe of Dan, and ſome would haue it that hee ſhould bee borne in Babylon, ſome that he ſhould bee bred vp in Bethſaida and Corazin, ſome that he ſhould bee raiſed in Syria, ſome that he ſhould be conceiued of the mixture of man and woman in ſinne, becauſe Chriſt was borne of a woman and conceiued by the holy Ghoſt, ſome ſay that he ſhall be of an ill-fauoured perſonage, becauſe it is written of Chriſt, comely and beautifull is he beyond the ſonnes of men: ſome ſay that he ſhall preach ſome certaine yeeres where Chriſt preached, and that he ſhall circumciſe him ſelfe, & ſay that he is Christ, and the Mesſias that was promiſed to bee ſent for the

ſaluation of the Iewes, ſome would perſwade that Mahomet was Antichrist, ſome hold the like of Nero, ſome ſay that he ſhould build vp the Citie of Hieruſalem, ſome that he ſhould ouerthrow Rome, ſome doe ſay that hee ſhould bee borne of a Frire and a Nunne, and that he ſhould worke wonders, & make trees to grow with the rootes vpward, and then ſhould fly vp into heauen and fall downe and breake his necke: and there bee other ſome haue ſaid, that he ſhall fight with the two witneſſes of Chriſt, Enoch and Hely, and ſhall kill them, and he himſelfe ſhall finally be ſlaine with lightning.
               Theſe tales and many others haue beene craftely deuiſed whereby to beguile vs, that whilſt we are thinking of theſe imaginations, and ſo occupy our eies in beholding a ſhadowe or a ſurmiſed coniecture what Antichriſt ſhould be, he that is Antichriſt (indeede) may vnawares deceiue vs.
            
            
               CHAP. III.
               What it was that deceiued the Iewes in the expectation of Chriſt.
               
                  THis was it that deceiued the Iewes in the knowledge of our ſauiour Chriſt: for when mā had by his owne ſinne drawne Gods wrath, & the decay of the whole world vpon his owne head, the almighty yet, of his wonderfull mercie and goodneſſe, promiſed vnto Adam that Chriſt ſhould come & breake the ſerpents head. This promiſe was deliuered ouer from hand to hand, and ſtill conueyed from the father to the ſonne, ſolemnely declared to Abraham Iſaach &

                  Iacob, committed as a pawne by Moſes to the people of Iſraell, celebrated by Dauid in his pſalmes and ſongs, renued and continued from time to time by many excellent and worthy Prophets, which pointed out the time, the place, and the maner of his comming, & ſet downe plainly and expreſly his ſtock, his parents and his birth many hundred yeares aforehand, the ſcriptures are full and the Prophets doe make often mention of this promiſe: old men and young men and all the people waited for the fulfilling thereof, euery eie was bent vpon him, and euery heart attended and wiſhed for his comming: but when the fulnes of the time was expired, & that he was come into the world indeede, they to whō this promiſe was made, euen thoſe that had ſo longed and wiſhed for him, and made all their common talke of the hope of his comming, when he came they knewIohn. 1. Ionn. 3 him not: He came into the world, and the world knew him not, he came into his owne, and his owne receiued him not:
                  Mat. 11. 
                  Light came into the world and men loued darkeneſſe better then light: they reuiled him and ſaid, Behold a glutton and a drinker of wine, a friend vnto publicanes and ſinners: they called him a falſe Prophet and a ſeducer of the people, they perſecuted him, betrayed him, ſcourged him and crucified him.
               Such was the receiuing of Chriſt: but this they did to him through ignorance, for if they had knowne him, they would not haue killed the Lords annointed, nor haue laid violent hands on the onely ſonne of GOD. But what was now the miſtaking? verily nothing but this, they looked for him after a carnall maner, and not according as the Scriptures had teſtified of him, for

they could not imagine any likelyhoode that Chriſt (by whom they thought all Iſraell ſhould haue beene ſo renowned) ſhould be ſo baſe and abiect a perſon in the ſight of the world, but they looked that their Meſſias ſhould haue come in triumph, to haue contented their ambition and pride: but hee was promiſed to come in humilitie, and to humble him ſelfe euen vnto death: they looked to haue had him prince-like, but hee was fore-promiſed poore: they looked for a great Captaine that ſhould haue performed the conqueſts of Alexander, when it was told them that he ſhould be both beaten and wounded: they looked for one that ſhould haue come with feaſting and banquetting, when it was told them aforehand that his bread ſhould be ſteeped in vinegre, and his cup ſhould be mingled with gall and bitterneſſe.
               Here was now the miſtaking, this was the ſtumbling blocke▪ and from hence grew the errour, that in ſtead of beleeuing they fell to crucifying the Lord and ſauiour of the world.
            
            
               CHAP. IIII.
               What it is that hath deceiued vs in the looking after Antichriſt.
               
                  NOw as the comming of Chriſt was, ſuch ſhall be the comming of Antichrist: the Prophets of the old lawe propheſied that Antichrist ſhould come: the Apoſtles, Peter, Paul, Iohn, yea Chriſt himſelfe foretold vs of him, the auncient fathers and

Doctors do often make mention of him, there is no mā ſoſimpleeither old or yong, either learned or vnlearned, but he hath heard of Antichriſt, they know that he ſhall be a falſe Prophet, a ſeducer, an enemy to Chriſt, and ſuch a one as ſhall ſet himſelfe directly both againſt Chriſt and his doctrine, they ſhall therefore hate his name, and deteſt him before they know him, they ſhall looke after his comming, & he ſhall not faile to come, and euery man ſhall cary hatred againſt him, and reckon him abominable: but as the Iewes that longed ſo much for the cōming of Chriſt, yet when he was come they knew him not, but accounted him amongſt theeues and robbers, becauſe they did not looke for him accordingly as the Scriptures had propheſied, but according to their owne imaginations as they had groſly conceiued: euen ſo ſhall bee the comming of Antichriſt: for he ſhall couer himſelfe with ſuch a cloake of holineſſe, That if it were poſsible the very elect ſhould bee deceiued: for men ſhall not know him, their eies ſhall be blinded, they ſhall hate his name, but imbrace his doctrine, they ſhall thinke they doe good ſeruice vnto Chriſt, but ſhall in trueth doe ſeruice vnto Antichriſt.
               
               From whence ſhall this errour ſpring from that very occaſion that deceiued the Ie

Wee alſo had ſpyed out Antichriſt long agoe, if wee had looked in the doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles: for this is to bee noted, that Antichriſt is not one man onely that ſhall ſodainly appeare with ſtrange ſignes and wonders as our anceſtors haue talked and dreamed of: but a relation to one State & kingdome, and a continuance of ſome one power and tyranie in the Church for ſo Chriſt him ſelfe hath propheſied, not ſpeaking of one man ſingulerly, but ſaith, Many ſhall come in my name, and ſhall ſay, here is Christ, &

               Where Antichriſt is to be ſought for, and how to be knowen.
               
                  WEe are now likewiſe to thinke that Antichriſt ſhall not apparantly manifeſt him ſelfe to be a tyrant, a robber, a ſpoyler: hee ſhall not ſay I am Antichriſt, I am that man of ſinne, I am that childe of pe

                     •
                  ie to Chriſt: nay he ſhall not lay him ſelfe ſo wide open, for then who would be deceiued by him? and he ſhall deceiue 
                        •
                     any. And in like maner if hee ſhould expreſl
                     •
                   ſay that him ſelfe were Chriſt, what chriſtian could he then ſeduce? ſo that he muſt neither ſhew himſelfe to be an open enemie to Chriſt, as was Mahomet, and as the Turke is, neither muſt he take vpon him to bee Chriſt, for then euery man would be warie enough of him.
               It ſhould follow then that Antichriſt muſt come diſguiſed,

he muſt put on him the cloake of ſimplicitie, of trueth, of holineſſe, perhaps of prayer, perhaps of faſting, perhaps of giuing almes, he ſhall come with fatherly lookes, with holy countenance, he ſhall alledge the Doctors and Fathers, he ſhall alledge Peter & Paul the holy Apoſties of Chriſt, he ſhall alledge Chriſt and God himſelfe.
               Thus vnder a pretence of ſeruing Chriſt, hee ſhall performe all his practiſes againſt Chriſt, hee ſhall de

                     •
                  e vp that which Chriſt hath planted, he ſhall be contrary to Chriſt in faith, contrary in life, contrary in doctrine, contrary in ſacraments, and in effect contrary in all things.
               Thus ſhall he walke craftely, and handle the word of God deceiptfully, hee ſhall mingle his lies with the trueth of God, he ſhall mix his poiſon with the wholeſome foode of our ſoules, ſo cloſely and ſubtilly, that it ſhall hardly be eſpied: he ſhall conuey him ſelfe into the hearts of the people, and ſhall ſo ſettle him ſelfe in their conſciences, that they shall admire him and haue him in reuerence. They ſhall ſay, who is like vnto the beaſt, who ſo wiſe, ſo learned, ſo vertuous, ſo holy, or ſo like vnto God himſelfe? Thus ſhall they honour Antichrist vnawares, when they ſhall ſay we de
                     •
                  ie him, and yet they ſhall fall downe and worſhip him. And as it was with Chriſt at his comming, he was in the world, he did the workes of his father, yet the feweſt part knew him: euen ſo muſt it be with Antichriſt, he ſhall be in the world, he ſhall doe the workes of his iniquitie,

and yet fewe ſhall know him.
               But let vs now more particularly fall to examination who this Antichriſt ſhould be: we haue already ſaid he muſt not be an infidel or heathen, one that ſhall apparantly ſet himſelfe againſt Chriſt, but he ſhall come in the name of Chriſt, and perhaps ſhall preach Chriſt counterfeitly, for the ſcriptures haue ſo propheſied of him, and as S. Hillary ſaith, He ſhall be contrary to Chriſt vnder the colour of preaching the Goſpell, ſo that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſhall then bee denyed, when a man would think he were preached, ſo couertly, ſo cloſely, and ſo ſubtilly ſhall Antichriſt behaue himſelfe in the ſight of the world.
               Was there euer man then that came in the name of Chriſt with the ſhew of holineſſe, with the countenance of the church, and hath ſhewed himſelfe in all his life and doctrine contrarie to Chriſt? if there haue euer beene any ſuch, without doubt the ſame is Antichriſt.
               
            
            
               CHAP. VI.
               An antitheſis betweene Christ and the Pope.
               
                  LEt vs here call the Pope a little into queſtion, let vs examine his proceedings, comparing his doings with our vndoubted ſauiour Christ, & we ſhall finde him ſo directly contrary in ſacraments, in ſacrifice, in prayers, in life, in religion, in doctrine, in the whole forme and order of the church, how hee hath ſhutwhat Chriſt hath opened, and hath opened

what Chriſt hath ſhut, he hath curſed where Chriſt hath bleſſed, and hath bleſſed where Chriſt hath curſed: finding him then to be ſo repugnant, and to ſet himſelfe ſo directly oppoſite, it muſt needes follow, that if Chriſt be Chriſt, the Pope muſt needes be Antichrist.
               
               But let vs come to ſome particulars to ſee what light they will giue vs concerning the premiſes.
               
                  Chriſt came into the world to ſeeke the glorie of his Father, the Pope is come into the world, and onely exalteth himſelfe.
               
                  Chriſt ſpared not his owne life, that we might raigne in an other world, the Pope ſpareth not our lines, that he may raigne in this world.
               
                  Chriſt fulfilled the lawe and the Prophets, the Pope maintaineth his owne lawes and traditions.
               
                  Chriſt forſooke the kingdomes of the world that were offered him by the diuell, the Pope hath receiued them, and thinketh them all too little.
               
                  Christ would neither be Iudge nor deuider in the world, the Pope iudgeth and deuideth all the world.
               
                  Chriſt was obedient to the temporall maieſtrates, the Pope holdeth Emperours and Kings in ſubiection.
               
                  Chriſt would waſh the feete of his owne diſciples, the Pope giueth his feete to Emperours and Kings to be kiſſed.

                  Chriſt ſaith bleſſed be the poore in ſpirit, for to thē belongeth the kingdome of heauen, the Pope ſaith, bleſſed are the proud and high minded, that will reſiſt and rebell againſt their Prince.
               
                  Chriſt ſaith it is as eaſie for a Cammell to paſſe thorough the eie of a needle, as for a rich man to enter into the kingdome of heauen, the Pope ſaith, heauen gates ſhall ſtand wide open to him that hath money to purchaſe Maſſes, Trentales, Dyrges, and to buy pardons.
               
               
                  Christ whipped the buyers and ſellers out of the Temple, the Pope maintaineth ſuch as make daily portſale of Maſſes and Dyrges in the Temple.
               
                  Christ ſendeth his about the world to preach glad tydings, the Pope ſendeth his about the world to 
                     •
                  ell pardons.
               
                  Chriſt when hee forgiueth, hee remitteth freely of grace, the Pope 
                     •
                  emitteth nor forgiueth any thing withou
                     •
                   money.
               
                  Chriſt faith, come vnto me thou that art laden, and I

will eaſe thee, the Pope ſaith, come vnto me thou that haſt murthered thy father, and I wil giue thee a pardon, if thou wilt giue me money.
               
                  Chriſt commandeth marriage, and onely forbiddeth whoredome, the Pope admitteth whoredome, and only forbiddeth marriage.
               
                  Christ faith, that a righteous man maketh righteous workes, the Pope ſaith, that righteous workes do make a righteous man.
               
                  Chriſt ſendeth the Scribes and phariſes to ſearch the Scriptures, the Pope forbiddeth that chriſtian menne ſhould ſo much as looke on them.
               
                  Christ hath giuen his the light of the Goſpell wherby to guide their ſteps, euen at midnight, the Pope hath giuen his a candle to light them with, becauſe they are ſtill groping in the darke, euen at midday.
               To be ſhort, Chriſt being God, became man, for the ſaluation of the world, the Pope being man becommeth God to the deſtruction of the world.
               Infinite might I be in this compariſon, if I ſhould proſecute it according to a trueth: and Chriſt ſaith, we ſhall know them by their fruits. Iudge of them now but as they deſerue, if Antichriſt is to be vnderſtood one againſt Chriſt, tell me where ſhall we finde him that is more contrary then the Pope?
               
               Furthermore, and for the better confirmation of this matter, I might here ſet downe many probable authorities, manifeſtly expreſſing the ſeare of Antichriſt to be at Rome, yea and further teſtified by ſeuerall antient writers, that he ſhould be aduanced in the Apoſtolike ſea: but left it might bee thought that all ſuch authorities

might rather be tearmed partiall opinions (as the Papiſt careth not what he ſaith) we will therefore pretermit all priua

               The first marke whereby to know Antichriſt, taken out of S. Iohn. 1. Epiſt. 2.

               Let vs now examine theſe words, & ſee if we cannot faſhion out Antichriſt by the ſubſtance of the Pope, or frame a Pope by the ſhadow of Antichriſt. Antichriſt and Chriſt are two contraries, and the ſtudie of Antichriſt is, to quench the name of

But he ſhall deceiue many, and the Pope abuſing the name of Chriſt, by that meanes ſetteth vp himſelfe, and gathereth offerings, tythes and rents, and beſtoweth them to his own profit, and not the honour of Chriſt, but bringeth the conſciences of the people vnder him through ſuſpitious

               Thus we do ſee the Pope taketh vpon him a greater power to forgiue ſinnes then chriſt: for chriſt forgiueth no ſinne but vpon vnfeigned repentance, and yet the Pope will not then ſuffer him to forgiue any more then the bare crime, for if we will giue him no money, the

paine muſt not be remitted but in the ſcorching flames of purgatory: if this be not directly the doctrine of Antichriſt, I referre me to their iudgements that are not too partiall, nay, that are not wilfully blinde.

                  e done by chriſts death, and ſo conſequently paine was more effectuall and ſtrong for me to obtaine heauen, then was chriſts paſſion: this is the Popes doctrine.
               
                  The reward of ſinne is death, and the paine that dependeth of euery ſinne (excluding Chriſt) is eternall damnation: then what ſhall purgatorie doe, vnleſſe for the vngodly, that ſhould firſt go to purgatorie, and after to hell? There is no remiſsion of ſinnes without blood, ſaith S. Paul. and chriſt ſpeaking to the theefe on the croſſe, ſaid. This day thou ſhalt be with me in paradiſe, not in purgatorie, and Marie Magdalen had her ſinnes freely forgiuen her by chriſt without going to purgatorie.
               But to ſay the trueth, there was at that time no ſuch place at all, nor any one word ſpoken of purgat
                     •
                  rie, either in the Old or New Teſtaments: and it was many yeares after chriſts death, before the Pope could kindle it, but after it once began to burne, it grew ſo hot,

that it melted more treaſure out of ignorant mens purſes, then the King of Spaines weſt Indies did then afford: but the extreame heat is now well allayed, and as men begin to wax wiſe, ſo the ſcorching fire doth daily more and more abate. Thus you may ſee, the Pope and his ſects are content to giue Chriſt his name, but they rob him of the effect, and take the ſignification of his name to themſelues, and they make of him but an Hypocrite, as they themſelues be, as though he forgaue vs our ſinnes, but not the paine due to our ſinnes, and then who ſhall be ſaued? for the paine due to euery ſinne, is eternall damnation.
               Theſe therefore (as the Apoſtle ſaith) are right Antichrists, and deny both the father and the ſonne, for they deny the witnes that the father bare vnto his ſon, and depriue the ſonne of the power and glorie that his father hath giuen him.

               Whatſoeuer opinion any member of Antichrist
                  
holdeth, the ground of all his doctrine is to deſtroy this article of our faith, That Chriſt is come in the fleſh: for though the moſt part of all heretikes confeſſe that Chriſt is come in the fleſh, in their maner, yet they deny that he is come as the ſcriptures teſtifie, & the Apoſtles preach him to become: for the whole ſtudie of the diuell and all his members is to deſtroy the hope, and truſt that we ſhould haue in Chriſts fleſh, and of thoſe things that he ſuffered for vs in his fleſh, and of the Teſtament and promiſes of mercie which are made vs in his fleſh: for the ſcriptures teſtifie, that Chriſt hath taken away the ſinnes of the world in his fleſh, and that the ſame houre that he yeelded vp his ſpirit into the hands of his father, he had fully purged, and made full ſatisfaction for all the ſinnes of the world.
               But that Chriſt hath done this ſeruice in the fleſh, all the members of Antichrist doe deny, and hereby (ſaith the Apoſtle) thou ſhalt know them.
               All doctrine that buildeth thee vpon Chriſt, to put thy truſt and confidence in his blood, is of God, & true doctrine: and all doctrine that withdraweth thy hope, and truſt from Chriſt, is of the diuell, and the doctrine of Antichrist.
               
               Let vs now examine the Pope by this rule, and wee ſhall finde that all that he doth is the deſtruction of this article, he wreſteth all the ſcriptures, and ſetteth them cleane againſt the hai

The Pope preacheth that Chriſt is come to doe away ſinnes, yet not in the fleſh, but in water, ſalt, oyle, candles, aſhes, Friers coates, and Munkes cowles, and in the vowes of them that forſweare matrimonie to keepe harlots, and ſweare beggerie, to poſſeſſe as much riches, wealth, eaſe, and pleaſure, as this world may afford them, and haue vowed obedience to diſobey, by authoritie, all lawes both of God and man, and theſe hypocriticall and falſe ſacrifices teacheth he vs to truſt vnto for the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and not in Chriſts fleſh.

               The third marke whereby to know Antichriſt.
               
                  
                     S. Paule againe in his ſecond epiſtle to the Theſſalonians, giueth this third marke whereby to know Antichriſt: where he ſaith, that Antichriſt ſhall ſit in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelfe that he is God.
               
               By this it may euidently appeare, that Antichriſt ſhall come in the name of Chriſt, and ſhall be a counterfeit chriſtian: for otherwiſe he ſhould haue beene an open and expreſſe enemy vnto Chriſt, A Turke, a

               But Antichrist ſhall ſit in the Temple of God, hee

ſhall not defy the name of Chriſt, but he ſhall call himſelfe Chriſts v

                     car, the most catholike father, the ſeruant of Gods ſeruants, by theſe meanes he ſhall be exalted in the eie of the world, he ſhall win the hearts of the people, he ſhall ſit in the conſciences of men, he ſhall make Kings and Princes to become his ſubiects, he ſhall deceiue the learned and wiſe, he ſhall caſt himſelfe into a colour of holineſſe, he ſhall faſt, he ſhall pray, he ſhall giue almes, hee ſhall walke as if hee were a diſciple of Chriſt, he ſhall go before, and the world ſhall follow him, they ſhall run to him out of all parts of the earth, they ſhall fall downe before him, they ſhall ſay vnto him, thou art the comfort of the Church, thou art the light of the world, thou art moſt holy, all law and all knowledge is hid in thy breaſt, we beſeech thy holines ſhew vs thy way, expound thou the ſcriptures vnto vs, teach vs how wee may bee ſaued, thou haſt the key of knowledge, thy word is the word of truth, thou canſt not erre.
               Thus ſhall Antichrist deceiue the world, thus ſhall he dwell in the conſciences of the people, thus ſhall he ſit in the temple of God, but the Apoſtle ſaith further, that he ſhall ſhew him ſelfe that he is God.
               
               The Apoſtle doth not ſay that he ſhall call him ſelfe God, for that were too broad, and euery man would then beware of him, and would ſay this is but a mortall man, borne as other men be of father and mother, and they likewiſe both mortall, and againe he ſhall die and returne to the earth from whēce he came: but God had no beginning neither ſhall haue ending, Antichriſt him ſelfe knoweth all this, and therefore will not dea

openly to call himſelfe God, but yet will ſhew himſelfe a GOD, and will be contented that other men ſhould ſo repute him, as Pope Nicolas ſaith, It is well knowne that the Pope (of the godly Prince Conſtantine) was called God. Againe in the Extrauagantes, in the ſame Canon Lawe, it is written, Dominus Deus noſter Papa, Our Lord God the Pope. And Chriſtofer Marcellus in the counſaile of Laterane, ſaid to the Pope, Thou art another God vpon earth.

                     BVt he ſhall ſhew himſelfe that he is a God (ſaith the Apoſtle) he ſhall receiue all reuerence as if he were God. The Pope hath done this you ſee, he hath compared his lawes with the lawes of God, hee hath ſaid that his word is the word of God, and whatſoeuer he ſaith, it muſt be ſaid it is the voice of the ſpirit of God, and of the ſame authoritie as is the Goſpell of Chriſt, no man may breake it, no man may touch the credit therof, if any man withſtand it, he muſt be accurſed, he muſt thinke hee doth ſacriledge, committeth blaſphemy, ſinneth againſt the holy Ghoſt, and muſt be counted an heretike: his authoritie reacheth vp into heauen, it ſtretcheth downe into hell, nay hee hath one kingdome proper to himſelfe more then euer God knew of, and that is purgatorie, there he raigne

                  h, there he ruleth, there he roſteth, there he broyleth, and there he commandeth how he

liſt, there is no bodie elſe to controule him.
               Thus doth Antichriſt ſit on the Temple of God: thus doth the Pope ſhew himſelfe that he is God.
               Nay what hath God proper to himſelfe, but that the Pope is either a ſharer with him, or at the leaſt can command the like?
               God hath heauen and hell, the Pope can command them both, and ſend to either the ſoules of whome hee liſt.
               God hath his Angels that be his miniſters, the Pope may command their ſeruice, and may imploy them about his buſines as often as it pleaſeth him, or elſe hi

               God hath his ſcriptures, & the Pope hath his Counſels, his decrees and his canons.
               God hath his Church, a poore ſillie one, the Pope hath his Church a braue luſtie one.
               God hath his ſacraments, the Pope maketh ſacraments two for his one.
               God hath his lawes, whereby to rule his Church, the Pope maketh lawes whereby to rule his Church.
               God commandeth the ſabboth day to be kept holy, the Pope maketh holy daies and halfe holy daies, ſometimes two or three in a weeke.

               Nay yet to ſhew himſelfe more like a God, the Pope will vndertake to make a God, a poore ſillie God, that

is not able to defend himſelfe from the malice of a mouſe.

               The Pope againe, directly oppoſeth himſelfe againſt Chriſt, and ſeeketh to drawe vs from the mercie of God, and telleth vs we haue other friends to whom we are beholding, and haue done many good things for vs: it was that Saint that tooke pittie of our

griefes (ſaith he) at ſuch a time: and our Ladie hath wrought many myracles at ſuch a place: but Saint Patricke is the good Saint, that hath done marueilous things in Ireland, and as euery Saint hath his peculiar property to worke more in one place then they can doe in an other: ſo euery Saint hath his ſeuerall office, ſome better for one thing, and ſome worſe for an other: one is very good for the falling ſickneſſe, an other is excellent good for the tooth-ache, one is a preſent remedy for a burn ing, an other is as precious for him that hath the chine▪cough. If a woman be barraine and would faine haue a childe, let her go on pilgrimage to S. Thomas of Canterburie, or in Ireland to the Holy Croſſe, or to S. Clen

               Thus euery Saint hath his ſeueral charge: euery man hath his ſeuerall Saint: and euery Saint is full of miracles, and euery myracle full of lies. The Papiſts doe alledge many vngodly reaſons, wherby they would maintaine a neceſſite in praying to Saints: and to auoide Idolatrie, they would make certaine diſtinctions betweene the worſhip of God and the worſhip of Saints: but let them diſtinguiſh how they can, this is certaine,Math.

               This is then to be noted, that euen as Chriſt at his comming, altered the ſtate of the Church, from the corruption of the phariſes, and confirmed his doctrine with myracles, ſo Antichriſt at his comming, ſeeketh to alter the Church from that puritie which Chriſt and his Apoſtles had left it in, and worketh myracles to o

Paul ſaith, He ſhall come with lying ſignes and lying wonders to deceiue, and what miracles be thoſe that the Pope hath brought to confirme his doctrine withall? looke through their golden legend, and tell me how many true myracles be in the whole booke: what apparitions of Saints, and iſions of angels haue beene forged to come from heauen? what yelling of ſpirits, and crying of ſoules haue beene faigned to come from purgatorie? theſe be myracles, ſignes and wonders wrought by Antichriſt & his miniſters: but as S.

               Can any thing be ſpoken more plainely? theſe ſhall be the workes of Antichriſt which hee ſhall bring to paſſe, that is to ſay, lying wonders: this ſhall he worke with all deceiueableneſſe, that is, he ſhall come with all kinde of ſhifts and deceipt: and with whom ſhal he preuaile, and who be they that ſhall bee deceiued?

               Theſe ſects haue beene all of them, inſtituted, ratified, confirmed and allowed by Antichriſt the Pope, & yet not founded all by one Pope, but by ſundry Popes: according to the words of the Apoſtle, There ſhall bee falſe teachers, which ſhall bring in damnable ſects: the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in the plurall number, and wee ſee it is fulfilled: and theſe ſects as they were infinite, ſo they were as diuerſe in their opinions, yet all of them of one aſſent in this, they all denyed Chriſt, and they all preached the Pope, they deny that Chriſt is ſufficient for their ſaluation, but they muſt atteine it by working, by

faſting, by going on pilgrimage, with a number of other ceremonies, too fooliſh to be ſet downe.
               
                  Here againe are the words of the Apoſtle verified, They ſhall deny the Lord that bought them, and follow their damnable waies, by whom the way of trueth ſhall be euill ſpoken of.
               Now what trueth in Chriſt doth not the Pope and his ſhauelings rebuke? and in ſetting vp their workes, and following their owne waies, deny altogether the truth of Chriſts waies?
               
                  And with faigned words they ſhall make marchandice of you, can any thing be more directly ſpoken? and to proue that they come with faigned words, where find we in any place throughout the whole ſcriptures that maketh mention of purgatory, of ſhrift, of the ſacraments of confirmation, of penance, of pardons, and ſuch other traſh, all of their owne faining, and by this meanes doe they make marchandice of our ſoules.
               Theſe lights and many others whereby to diſcerne Antichriſt, are left vnto vs in the holy ſcriptures, where the Beaſt ſeeing himſelfe to be ſought for, he roareth, and therefore to hide himſelfe the more cloſely, he perſecuteth the word of God, and ſeeketh with all wilynes to driue the people from it, and with falſe and ſophiſticall reaſons, would make vs afraid of it: he curſeth and excommunicateth thoſe that would reade it: perſwading them they are damned, if they doe but looke on it, but let not this diſmay vs to ſeeke our ſoules: health, for there we ſhall finde the ſweete promiſes of God, to the great comfort of poo

                  THe ſcriptures haue hitherto furniſhed vs with ſufficient notes whereby to know Antichriſt, and there are diuerſe teſtimonies yet to bee gathered, and all of them confirming the Pope to bee that man of ſinne that hath ſet himſelfe againſt Chriſt, but let vs here examine ſome fewe examples.
               Chriſt was humble and meeke, and the ApoſtlePhil. 2. Matth. 11. ſaith, He humbled himſelfe and became obedient euen vnto the death, euen the death of the croſse: and our ſauiour himſelfe commanding his diſciples to follow his example ſaith, Learne of me that am meeke and lowly in heart, & ye ſhall finde reſt vnto your ſoules: but is this humilitie to be found in the Pope? behold his eſtate, his doctrine, his diſciples, his life, you ſhall ſee nothing but pompe and glorie, he ruleth ouer nations and kingdomes, he maketh euery knee to bowe downe vnto him, hee maketh Emperours and Kings to bring him water, to carry his traine, to leade his horſe, to hold his ſtirrop, to

kiſſe his 
                     •
                  eete, he will needes rule ouer all the world, and ſaith, I am Lord of lords, and King of kings, the whole world is my dyoceſſe.
               If Chriſt, when the diuell profered him the kingdomes of the world and the glorie thereof, refuſed them as things impoſſible to ſtand with his kingdome, of whom is the Pope that hath receiued them? the diuel ſaid to Chriſt, Fall downe and worſhip me, and I wil giue thee all, the Pope ſaith to the Emperour, fall downe and kiſſe my feete, and I will giue thee thine Empire, he ſaith to kings in like maner, ſweare to defend me and my preſcriptions, and I will vphold thy crowne, & will giue thee this or that kingdome.
               And as Chriſt commanded his to be lowly, ſo hee commanded them to all obedience: but the Pope will none of that, but as he ſetteth himſelfe at liberty, and will be tyed to no lawe, neither of God nor man, ſo hee that will obey neither father, mother, neither Lord nor maſter, neither King nor Prince, let him but take the marke of the Beaſt, let him but ſhaue himſelfe a Monke, a Fryer, a Prieſt, or ſome any one of thoſe ſects formerly rehearſed, and the matter is diſpatched, he is exempted from all ſeruice and obedience due vnto man: and the more diſobedient he ſheweth himſelfe vnto the ordinances of God, the more apt and meete he is for the ſeruice of the Pope: neither is the profeſſing, vowing, and ſwearing obedience vnto their ordinances, any other thing▪ then the denying, defying, and foreſwearing obedience to the ordinances of God.
               Doth not the Popes doctrine flatly teach diſobedience, rebellion and inſurrection, commanding the people

to armes, and to ſend his tradition
                     •
                   with ſword and fire, and neither to obey father, mother, maſter, Lord, King nor Emperour, but to inuade whatſoeuer land or nation that will not obey his godhead? how beſtirreth he himſelfe at this day, that ſeeing his excommunications and curſings are ſo little regarded, that men doe eate their meate with neuer the leſſe ſtomacks, hee now falles to blowing vp the coles of rebellion, of ſedition, of treaſon, he raiſeth ſubiects againſt their Princes, and ſetteth Princes vpon their ſubiects, and thus vnder the tytle of Seruus ſeruorum, hee ſheweth himſelfe to bee Tirannus, tirannorum.
               
               This is the Popes doctrine, this is his humilitie, this is his obedience, and this is all his pietie that is ſo cloked vnder that great ſhew of holineſſe.

               The Pope taketh vpon him to bee the head of Christs Church.
               
                  THe Pope further chalengeth to be the head of Chriſts church, but what can be more contrary both to Chriſt and his Church? for the church beeing compact of many members, is made one bodie, whereof Chriſt is the head: God hath appeinted Chriſt euer all things to be head of the Church: now if the Pope will chalenge to be the head of this Church, what doth he then but make two heads of one body, deforming altogether, and making a monſter of the Church of Chriſt?
               Againe in ſeuerall places of the Scriptures, the

Church is called the ſpouſe of Chriſt, as S. Iohn in his Reuelation ſaith, The true Church, the ſponſe and wife of the Lamb: and an honeſt wife can haue but one husband & one head at one time▪ the which when ſhe forſaketh, and committeth her ſelfe to an other, ſhe playeth the Harlot, as that whori
                     •
                  h Church of Rome hath already done.
               And as Antichriſt hath thus ſought to disfigure the Church of Chriſt, ſo hath he likewiſe defaced the Sacraments left vnto the church by our ſauiour: for where chriſt and his Apoſtles haueleft the ſacrament o
                     •
                   Baptiſme, to be miniſtred with water and with the holy Ghoſt, Antichriſt hath added oyle to greaſe them, ſpittle to poiſon them, and ſalt to ſtifle them: for the ſacrament of chriſts body which he hath left vnto vs as a ſigne of his blood-ſhedding, and to be kept as a memoriall till his comming againe, Antichrist hath made it a moſt abominable Idoll, commanding it to be worſhiped, and the people thereby to commit Idolatrie.
               Thus hath he broken the firſt inſtitution. And where chriſt ſaith, Take ye, and eate ye: hee ſaith, kneele yee downe and worſhip. And where chriſt ſaith, Drinke ye all of this cup, the Pope ſaith, it ſerueth onely for the Prieſts, and that thoſe words Drinke ye all of thy cup, were onely ſpoken to the diſciples, as though the former words, Take ye and eate ye, were not in like manner ſpoken to the diſciples: but this is ſtill the condition of Antichriſt, to ſecke to ouerthrow what chriſt hath inſtituted.

               Of the fiue Sacraments inſtituted by the Pope.
               
                  TO thoſe two Sacraments left vs by chriſt, the Pope hath added fiue others ſpicke and ſpanne new of his owne making, and not one word throughout the whole ſcriptures, making any mention of them, nor neuer heard on; nor receiued in the church, till Antichriſt began to preuaile: the firſt of the fiue is the ſacrament of Confirmation, and this conſiſteth of two parts (as they ſay) the matter and the forme.
               The matter is holy Chriſme, confect and made of oyle-oliue and balme conſecrated by a Biſhop, an excellent receipt to ſcoure a ruſty corſlet.
               The forme is, when any one is confirmed, the Biſhop ſaying certaine words, muſt make a croſſe on the forehead of the party, with this inchanted ointment, and then (be it man or woman) they are made as holy, as a paire of old bootes w hen they come new trimmed from the currior: here is now to be noted, what themſelues doe attribute to this ſacrament, and theſe bee their owne words, The ſacrament of confirmation is ſaid to be greater then the ſacrament of baptiſme, becauſe it is giuen by worthier perſons, & in the more worthier part of the body.
               
               Is not this a ſound doctrine that a drop of greaſe, coniured and inchanted, ſhould be preferred & made

of better worth then the Sacrament of Baptiſme, left vnto vs by our Sauiour himſelfe: if this be not the doctrine of Antichriſt, let any man iudge that is not partiall.
               The Sacrament of Penance is the ſecond, inſtituted likewiſe by the Pope, and conſiſteth of three parts, Contrition, Confeſsion, and Satisfaction.
               
               Iudas, after he had betraied Chriſt, had Contrition, and when he knew they had condemned him, he repented: he had Confeſſion, I ha

                  e ſinned in betraying the innocent blood▪ 
                  he had  Satisfaction, he went to the high Priests, & deliuered backe againe the money▪ 
                  Now if Iudas be not a ſaint in heauen, the Pope is Antichriſt in the ſeate of Rome.
               
               They haue a third Sacrament of Extreame vnction, and this is to be miniſ
                     •
                  red to ſicke perſons, the matter is oyle-oliue, hallowed by a Biſhop, wherewith the ſicke is anoyled, vpon the eies, eares, mouth, noſe, hands and feete.
               And if it be a man, he is farther anoyled vpon the reines of his backe, but if a woman, then they doe it vpon her belly, they ſhew a filthy reaſon why, becauſe (they ſ

               Their fourth Sacrament is the ſacrament of Order, and this ſerueth onely for the conſec

orders, and therefore this Sacrament is better applyed then any of the reſt that were founded by the Pope.

he is contented to ſuffer the Turke there to haue a Temple, and the Iewes there to haue their Sinagogues, but hee can in no wiſe admit ſo much as a little Chappell, where the word of God may be purely preached, and ſincerely taught, no, he knoweth that if the Arke of God be brought into the houſe of Dagon, the Idol can not ſtand, but downe he falles preſently to the ground.
               The Popes doctrine can ioyne in good ſocietie with Turkes, with Iewes, with Infidels, whatſoeuer, onely the doctrine of Chriſts goſpell excepted: ſuch enmity there is ſtill betweene Chriſt and the Pope.

                  lfe, ſo there is but one vndoubted trueth (which is holy & giuen by the ſame God) and will admit of no other religion but it ſelfe: for whereſoeuer it becommeth, it confoundeth all other doctrines, that is or may be inuented by the ſubtiltie of Sathan, or any of his miniſters, and this is the cauſe that the Pope is ſo hatefull vnto it, and ſeeketh ſo much as in him lyeth vtterly to ſuppreſſe it.
               Hiſtories make mention, that in thoſe daies when the Romanes had brought the greateſt part of the world vnder their ſubiection: whereſoeuer they became victors, amongſt other ſpoiles they neuer failed

to bring away the Gods of the heathen, which were ſtill conueied to Rome, aſwell in token of their conqueſts: as themſelues in thoſe daies being likewiſe Infidels, carried this opinion, that the more Gods they had amongſt them, the greater truſt they had to preuaile in all their enterpriſes whatſoeuer they attempted.
               In the honour of thoſe Gods, Marcus Agrippa edified a Temple called Panthion, wherein theſe Idols were altogether placed.
               We do further reade, that after the Romanes had ſubuerted the Citie of Ieruſalem, it was thought good amongſt them, that a picture ſhould be made in the repreſentation of Chriſt, becauſe he had there beene reputed for a God (although a very ſimple one) and a very fewe there were at that time that did ſo eſteeme of him, yet being very loth that any God, great and ſmall ſhould eſcape them: but they would haue them all in Rome in this Temple of Panthion. The matter being thus in queſtion, in the end they got vnderſtanding, that Chriſt in his doctrine, would admit of no more Gods but one, whereupon they thought him not a neceſſari

               Tell me now, is not our holy father directly of this

humour, he can agree quietly with the Turkes and the Iewes, and they likewiſe with him, and hee can haue his Maſſe in one Church, and they can vſe their Ceremonies in an other faſt by, all at one inſtant, and all within Rome: but let any man come there that ſhould but offer to preach the Goſpell of Chriſt purely, and ſhould ſpeake againſt Idolatry, and the worſhipping of Images made with mens hands, and all Rome would be in an vprore, the Pope himſelf would be out of his wits, and he would neuer be in quiet, till he had tormented him, and put him to cruell death.
               This Temple of Panthion in Rome, is now called by the name of All halous, firſt builded by Marcus Agrippa, for all the Idols of the heathen, and after conſecrated by Bonifacius the fourth, to all the whole company of Saints, whereby it appeareth as well in that as in other matters, that the Pope hath well furniſhed his Church with many heatheniſh preſidents.

               The Citie of Rome is a continnall perſecuter of the children of God.
               
                  THat Citie of Rome, hath beene from the beginning, the greateſt perſecuter that euer was amongſt the Chriſtians, for as it is trueth, that the Church of Chriſt hath bin there eſtabliſhed, and that very faithfully and truely, ſo this is as certaine, that before it could be ſo eſtabliſhed, it was many yeares in performing, and coſt the liues of

an infinite number of Martyrs and Saints, neither had it after any long continuance, but that Antichriſt began to creepe in by little, & preuailed ſo much in the end, that he quite excluding Chriſt, hath in his place ſet vp himſelfe, and hath fithence beene a greater perſecuter of Chriſtians, then all the Tyrants that were there before the firſt eſtabliſhment.
               Now if God were their father, then would they loue Chriſt his ſonne, and ſeeke to ſet forth his glorie: if they were of the ſheepeſold of God, then would they heare

               Vnder the pretence of their vowed pouertie, they haue robbed the whole world of their wealth and treaſure, not ſuffering Emperours nor Kings to liue in quiet, that will not be ſworne to doe them ſeruice, &

to vphold their pride and ambition.
               The fruit of their wilfull obedience, is to exempt themſelues both from the lawes of God and man, in ſo much that if any Prince begin to puniſh their diſobedience, they curſe him immediately to the bottomleſſe pit of hell, and will proclame him no rightfull King, ſetting both his owne ſubiects, and other nations againſt him.

                  THey teach vs to fly from Chriſt, and worſhip Saints, who as the Papiſts themſelues ſuppoſe, are moſt cruell and mercileſſe tyrants, wreakefull and vengible, if their euins be not faſted, their Images viſited, ſaluted and worſhipped with a pater noſter, with a candle, with incenſe or other offerings, in that place which they themſelues haue choſen to heare ſutors, with their ſupplications and petitions.
               They fray and terrifie vs with their painfull purgatorie: the ſcorching heate whereof is ſuch, that it hath not onely conſumed infinit treaſure both of gold and ſiluer out of ignorant mens purſes, but it hath likewiſe melted Caſtles, buildings, Lands and tenements innumerable, to the profit of Monkes Friers, Canons, Prieſts reguler and ſeculer, and many men haue robbed their heirss, to giue perpetuities to theſe hypocrites to buy perpetuall prayre (but rather we may ſay to buy perpetuall paine) for they neuer appoint any

time of deliuerance, fearing that the Lands ſhould returne back againe to the right heires.
               There be ſome that haue giuen them large perpetuities to bee prayed for, of whom they haue made ſaints, receiuing offerings in their names, and teaching other men to pray vnto them that haue giuen great reuenues to be prayed for them ſelues, & yet the Pope for monie can emptie Purgatorie when he will: but if a man ſhould aske them by what authoritie the Pope giueth ſuch pardon, they anſwere that it is out of the merits of Chriſts paſſion, and ſo at the laſt they are driuen to confeſſe againſt themſelues, that Chriſt hath not onely deſerued for vs the forgiuenes of the crime, but alſo of the paine: and then if Chriſt hath deſerued all for vs, who giueth the Pope authoritie to reſerue a part of his deſeruing from me, and to ſell me Chriſts merits for money?
               His holynes ſends them to heauen with Scala Celi, that is with a ladder to ſcale the walles of heauen, for by the doore Chriſt, they will not ſuffer you to enter, but they haue ſtopt vp that way, becauſe they would haue you to buy their ſcaling ladders.
               They refuſe the precious blood of Chriſt, making themſelues aprons of Pope▪holy workes, as Adam did of fig leaues to hide his ſinne: an vniuſt righteouſnes, that will iuſtifie it ſelfe before him, where the Angels doe finde no other buckler then grace.
               And what are our workes, but a deformitie & filthineſſe in the ſight of God? our▪ſinnes are great, for they are againſt a great God: they are infinite, becauſe they are committed againſt him that is infinite, and

therefore we may not thinke to couer them with merit, nor to repaire them with ſatisfaction for our owne.

               But let vs come to our beſt perfections, and looke into our prayers and what are they but continuall offences, when in the middeſt of our greateſt vehemencie, our minds are by and by carried away with one vanitie or other ſo that when we haue prayed, we

                  LEt vs then be no longer deceiued, but follow the counſell of S. Paul, Try all things, and keep that is good. God hath giuen you the ſpirit of diſcretion, be wiſe therefore, and make triall to know what is good: learne of thoſe of Berea, who hearing Paul preach, made daily ſearch of the ſcriptures whether thoſe things were ſo which hee had taught them, and finding them to bee true, many of them beleeued: do you in like caſe make triall, and receiue nothing without good proofe and teſtimony, and when you ſhall finde that they are not contrary to the holſome doctrine of the word of God, Then keepe that which is good, ſettle your ſelues then, and be not caried away with euery blaſt of doctrine.
               Beleeue not theſe Ieſuites and Seminaries, that doe ſo beſtirre themſelues amongſt you in Ireland, to perſwade a religion that cannot abide the light of the Scriptures: would not any man that were wiſe, ſuſpect him that would ſet a Iewel to ſale, and would not ſuffer the buyer to looke vpon it in the light, but he muſt buy it in the darke, keepe it in the darke, weare it in the darke, and neuer bring it to any place where it might be perfectly ſeene and examined?
               Now who would not ſuſpect him for a couſening

companion, that would offer ſuch a thing? and can there be a greater ſuſpition of coſenage, then for men to offer a kinde of religion, that cannot abide the light of Gods word, and would inforce men to receiue ſuch a doctrine as they might not examine by the ſcriptures, to ſee how it would ſtand with the doctrine of Chriſt? who but coſening wretches would offer it? but what ignorance in thoſe men that would receiue it?
               
                  Beleeue not euery ſpirit, but try the ſpirits whether they are of God. At what time Achab would not beleeue the anſwere which the Prophet Micheas made him, there came forth a ſpirit and ſtoode before the Lord, and ſaid, I will go out and be a falſe ſpirit in the mouths of all his Prophets. Take heede you bee not deceiued by any of theſe ſpirits, which ſhall ſeeke to abuſe you, by pretence of reuelation, by viſions, by dreames, by ſhew of holineſſe: ſuch ſpirits are walking and daily conuerſant amongſt vs in Ireland. Woe be to you Scribes and Phariſes, hypocrites (ſaith Chriſt) for you deuoure widowes houſes, vnder the colour of longe prayers: but our hypocrites rob not widdowes onely, but they ſpoile married wiues, & make hauocke of Eſquires, Knights and Lords: they ſpoile all men, women and children, arming them with grudge, with murmure, with contempt, & ſometimes ſetting them in open rebellion againſt their Prince.
               And who are the inducers of theſe and many other miſchiefes, but your Ieſuites, your ſeminaries, & your vngodly maſſing Prieſts? theſe are they that are the common diſturbers of the Countries quiet, that haue ſtirred vp and ſet on foote many rebellions: theſe are they that haue blinded your vnderſtanding, abuſed

your zeale, and led you into ignorance vnder A counterfeit pretence of holineſſe.
               They will you to pray, and they teach you to truſt in your prayers, they bid you to faſt, they ſay you ſhall merit by your faſting: but be no longer deceiued, look into the fruits of this prayer and this faſting, that they haue ſo long taught, and wherewith they haue almoſt infected the whole realme of Ireland, (but eſpecially in the moſt remote places) & letting ſlip perſons of greater worth) whoſe eies I hope God wil open to ſee their owne faults) in beholding other mens follies, we will take but for our example, the baſe & barbarous Kearne, the very droſſe and ſcum of the Country, & yet what Ieſuite, what Seminarie, what Prieſt, or what other member of that raſcall rabble, that are more preciſe in their popiſh obſeruations, more abſtinent in their preſcribed faſting daies, and that are more ſcrupulous in any point of Poperie then they bee: and yet that very day, houre or minute, when they will nor touch any fleſh, butter, cheeſe egs, milk or ſuch other like, for defiling of themſelues, they will make no conſcience, to murther, to kill, to rob, to rauiſh, to ſpoile, or to commit any other villany whatſoeuer.
