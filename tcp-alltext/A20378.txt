                  Ashwedneſday in the morning. 1601.
            
            To the tune of Welladay.
            
               
            
            
               SWeet Englands pride is gone
               welladay welladay,
               Which makes her ſigh and grone
               euermore ſtill:
               He did her fame aduance,
               In Ireland Spaine and France,
               
               And now by diſmall chaunce,
               is from her tane.
            
            
               He was a vertuous Peere,
               welladay welladay,
               And was eſteemed deere
               euermore ſtill:
               He alwaies helpt the poore,
               Which makes them ſigh full fore
               his death they doe deplore,
               In euery place.
            
            
               Braue honor grac'd him ſtill
               gallantly gallantly,
               He nere did deede of ill,
               well is it knowne:
               But enuie that foule fiend
               Whoſe mallice ne're hath end;
               hath brought true vertues friend
               Vnto his thrall.
            
            
               At Tilt he did ſurpaſſe
               gallantly gallantly:
               all men that is and was
               euermore ſtill:
               One day as it was ſeene,
               In honour of his Queene,
               Such deeds hath ne're been ſéen,
               As he did doe.
            
            
               Abroade and eke at home,
               gallantly, gallantly,
               For vallour there was none,
               like him before:
               In Ireland France and Spaine,
               
               (They feared great Eſſex name,
               And England lou'd the ſame,
               In euery place.
            
            
               But all would not preuaile
               welladay welladay:
               His deedes did nought auaile,
               more was the pittie:
               He was condemn'd to die,
               For treaſon certainely,
               But God that ſits on hie
               Knoweth all things.
            
            
               That Sunday in the morne,
               welladay welladay:
               That he to the Cittie came,
               with all his troupe:
               That firſt began the ſtrife,
               And cauſed him looſe his life,
               And others did the like,
               As well as hee.
            
            
               Yet her Princely Maieſtie
               gratiouſly, gratiouſly,
               Hath pardon giuen free
               to many of them:
               She hath releaſed them quite,
               And giuen them their right,
               they may pray both day & night
               God to defend her.
            
            
               Shroueteweſday in the night.
               welladay, welladay,
               With a heauy harted ſpright
               as it is ſayd:
               The leiftenant of the Tower
               Who kept him in his power.
               At ten a clocke that hour.
               To him did come.
            
            
               And ſayd vnto him there,
               mournefully, mournfully,
               My Lord you muſt prepare,
               to die to morrow:
               Gods will be done quoth he,
               Yet ſhall you ſtrangely ſee,
               God ſtrong in me to be,
               Though I am weake.
            
            
               I pray you pray for me
               well day, welladay,
               That God may ſtrengthen me,
               againſt that houre:
               Then ſtraightway did he call,
               The Guard vnder the wall,
               And did intreate them all
               For him to pray.
            
            
               For to morrow is the day
               welladay welladay,
               That I the debt muſt pay,
               which I doe owe:
               It is my life I meane,
               Which I muſt pay my Queene,
               Euen ſoe hath iuſtice giuen,
               That I muſt doe.
            
            
               In the morning was he brought,
               welladay welladay:
               Whers a Scaffold was ſet vp,
               within the Tower:
               Many Lords were preſent then,
               With other Gentlemen,
               Which were appointed then
               
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   ſee him dye.
            
            
               You noble Lords quoth he
               welladay welladay,
               That muſt the witneſſe be,
               of this my death:
               Know I neuer loued Papiſtrye,
               But did it ſtill defye,
               And Eſſex thus did dye,
               Heere in this place.
            
            
               I haue a ſinner been
               welladay welladay:
               Yet neuer wrong'd my Queene
               in all my life,
               My God I did offend,
               Which grieues me at my end,
               May all the reſt amend,
               I doe forgive them.
            
            
               To the ſtate I ne're ment ill
               welladay, welladay,
               Neither wiſht the commons ill
               in all my life:
               But loued all with my heart,
               And alwaies tooke their part,
               VVh
                     •
                  ereas there was deſert,
               In any place.
            
            
               Then mildely did he craue
               mournefully mournefully,
               He might that fauour haue
               priuate to pray:
               He then prayed heartely,
               And with great feruency,
               To God that ſits on hie,
               For to receiue him.
            
            
               And then he prayed againe
               mournefully mournefully,
               God to preſerue his Queene
               from all her foes:
               And ſend her long to raigne,
               True Iuſtice to maintaine,
               And not to let proude Spaine,
               Once to offend her.
            
            
               His gowne he ſlipt off then
               welladay welladay,
               And put off his hat and band
               and hung it by.
               Praying ſtill continually,
               To God that ſits on hie,
               That he might paciently,
               There ſuffer death.
            
            
               My headeſman that muſt be,
               then ſaid he cheerefullie,
               Let him come heere to me,
               That I may him ſee:
               VVho kneeled to him then,
               Art thou (quoth he) the man,
               VVhich art appointed now,
               my life to free.
            
            
               Yes my Lord did he ſay
               well a day, welladay,
               Forgiue me I you pray
               for this your death:
               I heare doe ther fore,
               And may true iuſtice liue,
               No foule crime to for giue,
               VVithin their place.
            
            
               Then he kneeled downe againe,
               mournefully mournefully:
               And was required by ſome
               there ſtanding by:
               To forgiue his enemies,
               Before death cloſde his eyes,
               VVhich he did in heartie wiſe,
               Thanking them for it:
            
            
               That they would remember him
               welladay, welladay:
               That he might ſorgiue all them,
               that had him wrong'd:
               Now my Lords I take my leaue
               Sweet Chriſt my ſoule receiue,
               Now when you wil I prepare,
               For I am readie.
            
            
               He laide his head on the blocke,
               welladay welladay:
               But his doublet did let the ſtroke
               ſome there did ſay:
               What muſt be done (quoth he)
               Shall be done preſently,
               Then his doublet off put hee,
               and laye downe againe.
            
            
               Then his headeſman did his part
               cruelly, cruelly,
               He was neuer ſeene to ſtart,
               For all the blowes:
               His ſoule it is at reſt.
               in heauen among the bleſt,
               Where God ſend vs to reſt,
               When it ſhall pleaſe him.
            
            God ſaue the King.
