GREAT BRITTAYNES GREAT
HOAPE, CHARLES, PRINCE OF
WALES, &c.
            
               SIR:
            
            THis my ensueing Discourse of Votivae Angliae,
which in a Manuscript I sent to the King your Father,
on New-yeares day last; I now (in zeale and humilitie)
direct and send to your Highnesse in Print; I wrote it then to
his Maiestie, in fauour of the neglected Estate, and deiected, and
deplorable Fortunes, of the most Excellent Princesse (the Ladie
Elizabeth) your Sister; of the Illustrious Prince Pallatyne
her Husband, and theyr royall Progenie, for the vniust losse,
and shamefull detention of theyr Pallatynat and Electorat,
by the Trium-virat of Vsurpers, the King of Spayne, the
Emperour, and the Duke of Bavaria; I send it now to your
Highness, that (next under God) you (resembling your selfe)
will please to lend your best assistance and give your best
furtherance, to drawe foorth the King your Fathers Sword for
the happie restitution and reconquering thereof, whervnto the
tyes of Religion, Empire, and Honnor, infalliblie oblige hym.
            The eyes of the whole Christian world, (as soe manie Lynes
conducing to theyr Centre) are constantlie and curiouslie fixed
on the Glorious action, to see whether Great Brittayne (in this
iust and famous quarrell) will couragiouslie resolue to redeeme
her lost Honnor, or else cowardlie consent to lose it without anie
further sence, or hoape of redemption.
            Your Highness cannot looke on your selfe without seeing your

Illustrious Sister; nor see her without looking on her Princelie
Posteritie, sith you have as deepe Interest in theyr Blood, as your
owne heart hath in you. O then how can your Highness (whom
Grace and Nature, your Blood and your Vertues, haue made one
of the greatest Princes of the world) permit to see, or liue to
permit; That these Austrian Princes (whose malice is as
boundless as theyr Ambition and Treacherie) should, in a tyme
of a firm & setled Peace, thus perfidiouslie bereaue them of theyr
Honnors, and thus treacherouslie rob them of theyr Inheritance
and Patrimonie, yea and reduce them to soe extreame a poynt of
Calamitie and Miserie, that you are inforced to behold Pittie▪
Griefe, Dispayre, and Ruyne, to act theyr severall partes uppon
the Stage, and Theatre of theyr afflictions. O that this Affront
and Indignitie, should bee offred them in the Reigne of a King
soe Wise, and Potent, as your Father; and tollerated in the life
of a Prince soe generous and magnanimous, as your Highnesse,
her Brother, yea her onlie Brother, as shee is your onlie Sister.
            But the King of Spayne (the head and Oracle of the House
of Austria) hath not onlie wronged the Princess your Sister in
Germanie, but your Highness likewise in Spayne, as if (in
an inveterat and premeditated quarrell) hee made it aswell his
delight, as glorie, to abuse, and seeke the disgrace and ruyne of
the Blood of Great Brittayne; Wherof I hoape your Highness,
this Illustrious and famous Parliament, and the thrice Noble
Duke of Buckingham, hath now made the King your Father
sensibly confident, as before hee was confidentlie incredulous
therof.
            In a reciprocall requitall and revenge wherof (because these
manifestlie malicious affronts of Spayne, towards our
Souveraigne, and his Royall posteritie, are of too contemptible

and pernitious a Nature, to bee suffered; and of too fatall and
dangerous a consequence to bee digested and tollerated) all the
Subiects of this Kingdome, (except those fierie Transalpine, and
factious Transmaryne English, whoe have onlie theyr bodyes
heere, but theyr harts in Rome and Spayne,) doe vehementlie
desire Warre with Spayne, as knowing it necessarie for our
Estate, and safe and honnorable for our King, and his Royall
Posteritie; yea, they all vniversallie applaud this highe and
prudent Court of Parliament, for motioning and seeking that
Warre, infinitlie honnor your Highness for soliciting and
advancing it, and exceedinglie blesse the King your Father for
approving and consenting thervnto, by his Royall Declaration,
which will make his Name famous, and his Fame immortallie
glorious to all posteritie.
            Yea it seemes Heaven and Earth concurre with us in this
happie resolution, to take downe the Ambition and pride, and to
curbe the power and mallice of Spayne. For the distaste of
the French, the Defiance of the Hollanders, the Iealousie of
Savoy, and Venice, and the zeale and resolution of England,
(now demonstrated in her Representive bodie the Parliament,
whoe cheerfullie proffer theyr whole Estates and Lives, to soe
Iust, soe necessarie, and soe Honnorable a Warre,) the Honnor
and safetie of our owne Estate; the Glorie of GOD, and the
defence and protection of his afflicted Spouse the Church, doth
agayne and agayne invyte your Highness Sword, and c
                  •
               niure his
Maiesties last and speedie resolution to beginne this Warre.
            For it is not enough for the King your Father, your Highness,
and the Parliament, to give a forme to your Militarie Consultations,
except yee (cast off all delayes, remove all letts, obstacles
and procrastinations, which may retard or oppose it,) give a life

to that forme, and a resolution to that life by drawing your
Contemplation into Action, that our Ships and selues may bee in
a readiness to prevent Spayne, ere Spayn bee readie to prevent
us; and of power to strike him, ere hee can possiblie bee sufficientlie
powerfull to threaten us; and that our Regiments and
Squadrons bee inrolled, and in sight of theyr Coullers, and ready
to March at the verie first calle of the Drumme, sith England,
and Scotland, never sawe feare but in the fronts and faces of
our Enemyes, and alwayes went to the Warres as to a Ioyfull
Wedding, or to an assured Victorie and Triumph.
            Great Prince, you saw and understood what a world of ioyfull
Bonfires, (or fires of Ioye) wee made, when your Highnesse
returned from Spayne, with as much safetie as you went foorth
with danger, yea our zeale and affection is soe ardent to your
Highness, because your Obedyence is such to the King your Father,
that wee shall iustlie hold our selues wronged of the Parliament,
if they (for themselues & the whole Kingdom) be not Peticioners
to the King your Father, that hee will please to ordayne, that wee
may Religiouslie keepe and obserue two newe Holidayes and
Festivals, and that they may bee henceforth marked with
Rubrickes in our Almanacks, to the end that not onlie our selues
but our Posteritie may yearelie celebrate and obserue them, with
a world of Bonfires of Ioy and ioyfull shouts and acclamations
of reioycing; viz. The 5th of October, the day of your Highness
arrivall from Spayne, and the 24th of March following, the
day that your Match with Spayne was broken off, and Warres
declared for the restoring of the Count Pallatyne and his Heyres
to theyr Pallatynat and Electorat. That as wee therin doe
nowe participate of the causes of our Ioy, soe they hereafter may
enioye them by feeling and enioying the effects therof; For, for

the honnor & safetie of our King, and of all his Royall Posteritie,
and for the flourishing prosperitie & welfare of the Church and
Estate of the Israell of our Great Brittayne; hee is not a true
Subiect, a faythfull and loyall-harted Britton, noe nor the sonne
of an honnest man, that is not ready and willing to beare his life
on the poynt of his Sword, and (if occasion present) to lose it,
rather then to retayne and preserue it in soe Iust and Honnorable
a quarrell.
            And your Highness (for seconding and fortifying of this your
Royall Fathers Warlike resolutions, agaynst his Maiesties, your
owne, and your Illustrious Sisters Enemyes, in the Two mayne
poynts of our Welfare and Honnor, (Englands preservation,
and the Pallatynats restitution) will accumilate and heape upp,
a whole world of Blessings and benedictions, on your Princelie
head from your Fathers good Subiects; whoe with one Tongue,
one heart, one affection, and one soule, will (with as much Ioy as
zeale, and as much zeale as Dutie) Pray unto God for the long
prosperous and victorious Life of the King your Father, (my
Gracious Souveraigne) of your Royall selfe, of our Gracious
Princess your Sister, of the Illustrious Prince her Husband, and
theyr Royall posteritie, The which none shall performe with
more true Zeale, and unfeigned Devotion, then
            
               Your Highness, his most
humblie Devoted Seruant.

            The Printer to the Reader.
            GEntelmen, the Author his remote absence from the
Presse, hath occasioned mee to commit manie
Errours, wherof hee is innocent, his deserts crave and
deserve you to reforme them, and I likewise desire it,
aswell for your satisfaction, as for myne owne excuse.
            Farewell.
         
      
      
         
            
            
               My Most Sacred Soueraigne:
            
            I Should not bee that which God hath made me to be,
your Majesties most obedyent and most faythfull
Subject, if I were not a thousand times more jealous and
zealous for the preservation of your Maiesties, and your
royall Childrens welfare and honnor then of myne owne
life; But sith Grace hath made me soe fortunat, and
Nature soe happie, as alsoe composed me of a temper,
that I had rather die for speaking the truth, then liue
eyther to Conceale or Desemble it to your Maiestie;
Therfore in the behalfe of the forsaken Prince Palatyne,
your Sonne in Lawe, of his sorowfull Princesse your onlie
Daughter, and their mournfull posteritie, for the losse of
their neglected Patrimonie the Pallatinat, wherin my
Conscience (guyded by the truthe) informes my soule
that your Maiesties honnor extreamlie suffers. Giue mee
leaue, O giue me leaue my Most Gratious King (in all
humilitie and Dutie) to send these ensewing motiues and
reasons, to your Maiesties serious pervsal & consideratiō,
therby to incyte and stirre up your Royall resolutions, for
the refetching and reconquering therof, wheron at
present the eyes of the whole Christian worlde are
constantlie fixed. And thou great God of Heaven, whoe
(at thie pleasure and in thie providence) swayest the harts
and hands, the affections and actions of all the Kinges of
the Earth thie Vicegerents; So blesse my Soveraign and
all his sences in the reading therof, that his Majesties
Iudgement prevayle ore his passion, his Courage
out-braue his feare; that naked Truth may take place of

disguised Imposture, and royall Iustice triumph ore
hoodwincked and treacherous Vsurpation.
            Although it be true, that the Prince Palatyne your Son
in Law, committed a first errour of Estate, in assuming
and taking on him the Crowne of Bohemia; will your
Majestie therfore commit a second in permitting him to
lose his Pallatinat: or because hee wanted no Ambition
but Iudgment to attempt that; must your Matie. therfore
want affection, zeale, and equitie to him, to the Princess
your Daughter and their royall Issue, to tollerate & suffer
this. You likewise sawe and suffered the Emperour to
chastice him from Bohemia; and therin you shewed an
act of Iustice, which celebrates your fame to all Europe;
but if your Majestie permit him for euer to ruyne him,
and absolutelie to Depriue him of his and his Childrens
Patrimonie, that wilbe a Dishonorable testimonie of too
great disrepect, and want of affection in your Majestie as
being their Father, and of too much feare & pusilanimitie
as beeing a Great and Potent King; and this will not
onlie blemish but eclipse it to all the world. Doe I
speake of Dishonnor, O then I beseech your Majestie to
consider, how long Honor is purchasing, how soone lost,
and that having sacrificed all the actions of our life to
preserue it, wee neede but one Errour to ruyne it; and as
the meanest Gentelman is bound to this rule, soe the
greatest Princes and Monarckes of the world, haue
(consequentlie) the greatest shares and interrests in the
prevention therof. For the true Matchiavillians and
Emperickes of Estate, who tearme honnor but smoke, are
deceived and ignorant of Honnor; Sith to defyne it

aright, it is the purest golde of a Kinges crowne, and the
richest Diamond to embelish and adorne it; yea, it is a
great part of that which makes a King a King, because it
giues him just reason to Commaund his subjects, & they
as just cause to obey him; and which is more, the retaining
therof pure, and the preserving therof immaculate,
makes him to bee both feared and beloved of all his
neighbour Princes, whoe otherwise will haue just cause
to neglect & Contemne him, because he first contemned
and neglected it. Soe were your Matie. onlie a spectator,
and not an Actor, or had you noe Interest in the
Pallatynat, you should then receiue noe Dishonnor not
to attempt, or seeke the restitution therof. But sith (for
the good of your Disinherited Children) you haue as
deepe Interest in that famous Province, as you haue in the
Royall blood which streames in their hartes and veynes,
will it not be an honnor for your Majestie to restore it to
them, sith it was lost with shame, and a shame if you
restore not them to it with honnor: And in regard the
Emperour and Duke of Bavaria haue conquered it from
them by Vsurpation, will it not bee an action as full of
Compassion as glorie, for the King of Great Brittayne to
reconquer it from them with Iustice. And although
peradventure, the current of other mens affections and
passions, transport your Majestie from the true way of
truth, in beleeuing that the Dishonnor of this losse, falls
onlie on the Count Pallatyne, & no way reflects on your
Royall and Sacred person, yet the best of your subjects
beleeue, though the woorst are soe treacherous to affirme
the contrarie, that the Honnor of your three Crownes

and Kingdoms, doe infinitly suffer in the loss of this one
famous Province, because it is the Inheritance of the
Prince your Sonne in Lawe, the Dowrie of his Princesse
your Daughter, and the Patrimonie of those Royall
plants their Children; In which consideration, is not the
losse therof as worthie of your Compassion, as the
reconquering is of your Courage. For if your Majestie
whoe is a potent and mightie Monarcke, permit this
Illustrious (though poore) Prince your Sonne in Law to
bee deprived of his Pallatynate, and Electorate (and
consequentlie ruyned in his reputation for euer) you
haue farre more reason to rest confident then incredulous;
that the Austrian Princes excepted of the one side, and
those Princes to whome you are allyed by blood or
affinitie of the other, as you will assuredly make him the
pittie, soe you will likewise infalliblie make your selfe the
laughture of all the rest of the Princes of Christendom.
            But how can the Prince Pallatyne hope of soe great,
and soe just a felicitie that your Majestie will restore him
to his Pallatynat, sith you mought haue donne it with
farre facilitie and lesse charge, when Heidelberg the head,
and Manheym and Frankendale, the two eyes of that
Province couragiously held out, and were yet in lyfe and
vigour; and that 5000. of your subjects then added to
these Valiant bands, which were alreadie there vnder the
Conduct of Noble Vere, and Braue Boroughes, &c. would
not onlie haue prevented the ambitious Designes, but
also ruyned the covetous resolutions of the Emperour,
and Duke of Bavaria in the vsurping therof; which now
15000. can difficultlie effect. How can hee hope for it,

when (under the cloake of consignation & sequestration)
hee sees with feare that your Majestie hath given away
Frankendale to its Deprivation; How can hee hope of
this courtesie from your Sword, when your Majestie, and
your Ambassadours, your tongue and your penne haue
actually consented to dishonnor him, by dispoyling him
of his Honnors: For as the Emperour justlie razed out
his Title of King of Bohemia, soe your Majestie
derogated from the affection of a Father, to
ommit and exclude those of Count Pallatyne and
Elector, in all your Treaties, and negotiations
with the Emperour, the King of Spayne, the
Archdutchesse, and the rest of the Princes Electors of
Germanie, vnlesse your Majestie were desirous, that the
sayd Count Pallatyne your Sonne in Lawe, should be by
his enemies degraded of his Honnors and Dignities
before his tyme, which untimely omission & connivency
of your Majestie, hath in undervalewing him, extreamly
undervalewed your selfe, and made the pride of the
Emperour, and his Duke of Bavaria, flye a pitch both
beyond themselues and beyond Ambition. How can he
hope for it, sith your Majestie now permits that the
Dukes of Brunswicke, and Lunebourg, Count Mansfield,
the Lantgraue Maurice, with other Noblemen their
adhaerents and partisans, whoe haue wedded his quarrell,
should now bee abandoned by your Treatie, and held
unworthie to bee affected and protected by your Maties.
royall favour and assistance; that they whoe haue soe
valiantlie and constantlie defended his cause, (and in it
the generall good and peace of Germanie) should now

by your Treatie of Suspension of Armes, be enforced to let
fall their swordes out of their handes, and with them
their lyues, That they whoe (partlie out of affection to
him, and partlie out of your Majesties owne procurement
and solicitation to themselues) haue prodigally spent
their wealth and blood for his sake and seruice; should
now by him and your Majestie, bee abandoned as a prey,
and sacrificed as Victymes to the implacable revenge of
the Emperour and Duke of Bavaria; an Act soe odious
and dishonnorable in the sight of God and man, as
neyther your Maiestie, nor the Prince Pallatyne your
Sonne in Lawe, can heare it proposed without extreame
ingratitude, nor consent therto without infinite shame
and eternall Dishonnor, both to your persons and
memories. How can he hope for it, when he understands
that manie of your Courtiers (with lesse judgement then
passion, and more Enuie then truth and Charitie) doe
without controlement, tearme the Princes of Germany
Traytors for hauing assisted him, and yet what haue
they not hazarded for his affection, and attempted for
his service. How can hee hope for it, when your Maiestie
permitted the Emperour, and Duke of Bavaria, to violate
in hostile manner the Royall protection, wherin you
tooke and receyued that which remayned of the
Pallatynat, and when you had commaunded your sayd
Sonne in Lawe to Disarme, and hee and all his Armie to
desist and retyre, that then contrarie to your royall
promise to him, as alsoe to your owne expectation, you
should permit his Enemies to conclude and finish their
Conquest of his Countrye; Which in effect was to

ruyne him whome you promised to assist, A scarre and
sicatrice, which will infallibly remayne apparant and
notorious upon the face of your Majesties raigne, except
the remedie and resolution of your Sword redeeme and
deface it. How can hee hope for it, when as the common
compassion of those whoe are least Compassionate, are
I wish I could as soone remedie as Pittie your deiected Estate;
and that this of your Majestie towards him, comes farre
too short the rules of vulgar Charitie, much more the
bonds and tyes of Naturall and Royall affection, sith
your Majestie is so farre from remedying his wronges,
as you wil not pittie them, and which is worse, you can▪
but will neyther pittie, nor remedie them. How can hee
hope for it, when you haue permitted that all his fortunes
bee onlie reduced to hope, and his feare to Dispayre.
How can hee hope for it, when (sith it is an injurie as
Publius Mimus reporteth, To laugh at other mens
Calamities and misfortunes) that so manie of your
Subjects, and which is woorse, of your Courtiers,
lycentiouslie insult and triumph at his overthrowes,
and scoffe at his afflictions, without considering
that hee is the Husband of our Princesse, and
our Kinges onlie Daughter, and his Children our
Royall plantes, of the Stocke and Blood royall of Great
Brittayne, and without receiving any punishment, or
checke from your Majestie, for the base enormitie of
this their foule ingratitude, and incivill Disrespect and
Contempt, whome you may easilie discerne, distinguish,
and finde out from your faythfull and loyall hearted
Subiects, sith there is as great Difference betwixt the

last and the first, as there is betweene true Protestants,
and insolent and dangerous Papists. And to conclude
and shut up this poynt, How can hee hope for it, when
you will not honnour or affect his Princesse your
Daughter, and their famous and flourishing Posteritie
so much, as in these theyr immerited miseries, to receyue
and harbour them into the Sanctuarie of your Kingdom,
It beeing the last courtesie and consolation, which
Nature tells mee theyr Princelie byrth deserues, & your
royall Blood owes them.
            And yet againe, this neglected and dejected Prince
your Sonne in Lawe, hath contrariwise much reason to
hope, that your Majesties Royall woord and promise
ingaged for the restoring of his Pallatynat, (added to the
consideration of your owne Honnor, which inviolablie
tyes you therto) will in the end incyte and stirre you upp
to Drawe your sword, for the effecting and performance
therof; For the wordes of Kinges should bee sacred,
and their promises inviolable, the Lawes of Nature
and Nations, tying them to the obligation of the first,
those of Grace and Heaven obliging them to the
performance of the last. And if your Majestie be pleased
to forget, yet the representiue Bodie of England, the
Lords, Knightes, and Burgesses of your Highe Court of
Parliament, must and will remember, that your Majestie
protested unto them solemnlie; That (eyther by Treatie
or by the Sword) you would cause the Pallatynat to bee
restored, though to the hazard of your owne Kingdoms;
Or if your memorie (which in all other actions is exquisit
and excellent) should forget your promise in that

poynt; yet the Iudgements and understandings of your
Malesties subiects are more then assured and confident,
that your Royall penne affirmed it to your Printer, and
hee to vs in your Declaration, wherof looke how manie
thousand Bookes there are extant, soe many witnesses
(without exception) there will remayne against your
Matie. that you onlie made that promise and protestation
purposlie to breake it; For till they see the contrarie, the
most loyall and faythfull of them will never beleeue it,
sith your Majestie may performe it but will not, and sith
at your pleasure you haue the meanes, both to humble
the pride, and to scourge the power of the Emperour, and
to make the Duke of Bavaria repent with blood and
teares, for his insatiable Ambition and Vsurpation, in
vsurping and bereaving the Pallatynate from your
Children.
            And because the affayres of the World (resembling
the ebbing and flowing of the Sea) are still subiect to
revolution & change, and onlie constant in unconstancie,
as alsoe that (Euripides sayth) good is never seperated
from Evill, and that it is impossible for us to avoyde
misfortunes or adverse accidents, because Plutarque tells
us, that Prosperitie is still transitorie, never Permanent.
Soe I beseech your Majestie to confider, that if uppon
any unexpected Accident, you should breake, and haue
Warres eyther with France, Spayne, or the Netherlands,
what a braue assistance of German Reistres, you should
still haue at your Commaund from the Count Pallatyne
your Sonne in Lawe, of his Subiects and Friends, if hee
had agayne the Commaund of his Countrye, and alsoe

how necessarie those troupes of Cavalrie would bee for
your Maiesties service; eyther to make or divert, to
beginne or end a warre. Wherof if Henrie the IIII. of
France (of immortall same and memorie) were still
living, hee could giue your Maiestie a true president and
instance therof in himselfe, when his affayres were soe
weake and desperate, as hee was inforced to haue recourse
to their assistance, the which Lewes his Sonne now
raigning, hath verie unkindlie denyed, to acknowledge
and requite to the Count Pallatyne your Sonne in Lawe,
now in the extremitie of this his affayres and afflictions.
And to ascend from earthlie regards to heavenlie
Considerations; If all these former Motiues cannot
prevayle with your Maiestie, to purchase and effect his
desire, yet lastly hee hopes that you will drawe your
Sword to performe it, for that Religions sake which is
immediatly derived from God, or for Gods sake, from
whome (as from the blessed and sacred Fountayne of all
Happiness) all true Religion hath its true byrth, lyfe, and
propagation; and farre the sooner hee hopes, that your
Maiestie will attempt it with Courage, and prosecute it
with resolution; Sith God hath made your Maiestie the
Defender of the Faith, and hee and all the Churches of his
Pallatynat did, and then agayne will professe the same
Fayth which you Defend, wheras now they are infected
with the dregges of Idolatrous Poperie, and poluted
and defyled with the mystes and fogges of prophane
Superstition.
            But Illustrious Prince Pallatyne; because it is a
disputable question, whether thy Courage or Misfortune

bee greater; therfore I grieue with sorowe and lament
with Griefe to see all these fayre hopes of thine, soe
untimelie wythered and reduced to nothing, and thou
hast nowe tryed to thie preiudice, and seene to thyne
owne Woefull and fatall experience, That hope which is
built uppon other mens promisses, and maintayned by
forraigne power, proves most commonly ruynous.
            And will not your Maiestie then bee sencible, of this
fruitlesse and fatall hopes of the Prince your Sonne in
Lawe, which were whollie grounded uppon the sand of
your promises, as yours are uppon the snowe of the
Emperours and the King of Spaynes. For to represent
you Truth in her naked coullers, (& not in an adulterated
attyre and tincture) and soe to poynt at that poynt of the
Compasse, from whence the contrarie wyndes haue
blowne your Maiestie all these severall tempests of
dishonnor, and your Sonne in Lawe these stormes of
adversitie; hath it not beene your too much connivencie
in relying uppon the deceiptfull flatteries of the
Emperour, and your too excessiue confidence in trusting
to the temporising promises of the King of Spayne
which hath occasioned it; For by their Ambassadours
and Letters, haue they not depaynted you the restitution
of the Pallatynat soe easie, as in assurance therof, you
became passionatly resolute that you had farre lesse
reason to doubt then to beleeue it. And yet to the
whole world aswell as to your owne Subiects it
administreth more cause of admiration then beliefe, to
thincke that your Majestie who is the wisest, & learnedest,
yea one of the most potent Kinges of the world, should

thus bee contented with Drosse for Golde, with shame
for Honnor, and fedde with verball promisses in steed of
reall performances; For your Majestie knowes (and your
Subjects are not ignorant) that Carlile, Bristoll, Belfast,
and Weston, have spent infinite much, and yet gotten just
nothing from the Emperour, by theyr severall legations;
as also that that which they spent abroad, and your
Majestie at home, in Entertaynments, Feasts, and Guifts,
on the Emperours, the King of Spaynes, and the
Archdutchesse Ambassadours, would undoubtedlie
have reconquered the Pallatynat, and what is this, but
their malicious and pernicious policie to drayne your
Majesties purse drie, and to exhaust your Exchequer;
therby purposlie to clippe the winges of your Courage,
power, and resolution, from flying to the restoration
of the Pallatynat; Neyther shall your Majestie have just
cause to accept against mee, for heere joyning the King
of Spayne with the Emperour in the Detention therof;
sith their swordes and forees aequallie Conquered it, or
if not the King of Spayne (as the vulgar beleeue) for the
Emperour, yet undoubtedlie the Emperour and Duke of
Bavaria (as the cleerest sighted knowe) for the King of
Spayn; because uppon the vvhole the Emperour is more
the King of Spaynes servant and creature, then the
Duke of Bavaria is the Emperours, and therfore that it is
rather more to bee feared then doubted, that as hee first
tooke Aix and Weesell for the Emperour, and ever since
keepes them for himselfe; that right soe hee intends to
deale with the Pallatynat; and if your Majestie vvould
but turne your back to Spayne, and your eyes to the

Pallatynat, you will then confirme my oppinion, wheras
(with a fearfull jelousie) I apprehend, that turning your
backe to the Pallatynat, and your eyes to Spayne, you
maye peradventure passionatlie oppose and contradict
it; For as the diseases and iniquitie of our tymes, and the
Vanitie of our Natures are such, as manie tymes wee see
Ambition gives a Lawe to Nature, and the strongest
sword proves most commonlie the best right and tenure.
Soe notwithstanding that the Emperour bee puffed upp
with joy and pride for this his good success, yet the
King of Sayne thinckes that the Pallatynat is but a debt
dewe to his Vertue, and a tribute to his Ambition and
Greatnesse.
            And that your Majestie maye the more perfectlie and
apparantlie consider them destinctlie or joyntlie, and
soe looke from theyr tongues to theyr hartes, from theyr
wordes to theyr actions, and from the barke of theyr
Friendshippe to the tree of theyr Intents; Swartsenbourgh
from the Emperour, brought onlie Complements but
noe deeds not hoapes of restitution of the Pallatynat;
Bosquet from the Archdutchess, (under the cloake of
trust and consignation) carried away Frankendale, the
last hostage and pledge of that Province; and last of all
Mexia (with his statelie Embassye) pretended from the
sayd Princess, but intended from the King of Spayne,
came to Comply with your Majestie, to make fayre
weather of all sydes, to keepe everie byrd in his neast and
your Majestie Sword still rusting in his scabberd; yea if
the hartes of Inijoca, Mendoza, and Columba, (whome I
reverence and honnor for the honnor of theyr places.)

were as visible and transparent as Iulius Drusus wished his
house; Then (notwithstanding all theyr veluett wordes
and silken protestations and vowes) your Maiestie
should see without perspective or spectacles, that the
most retyred Article, and secret mysterie of theyr Kinges
Commission to them is; To give theyr Infanta to our
Illustrious and famous Prince Charles, but infalliblie with
this proviso and reservation, still to keepe the Pallatynat
for the behoofe and use of the King theyr Master; And
what else doe all these severall Ambassadours in England,
and whervnto tend all theyr severall legations, but onlie
to conceale the Ill which is, and to pretend the Good
which is not, in the designes and resolutions of the King
theyr Master; For in all theyr Treaties and Negotiations
with your Maiestie and your mynisters, what doe they
else but purposlie play theyr prizes, in practising theyr
chiefest invention, Arte, and skill, to procrastinate the
restitution of the Pallatynat, making everie daye
produce newe Difficulties and Evasions, till in the end
they have made the Cure woorse then the Disease, and
which (without the helpe and assistance of your
Maiesties sword) will verie shortlie prove incurable, and
meerlie Physique after death; For the Emperour, the
king of Spayne, and the Archdutchesse, doe onlie feed
your Maiestie with the emptie ayre of hoapes, and with
the bitter sweet sugar of manie flattering and false
promises, that they will restore the Pallatynat to the
Prince your Sonne in Lawe, whiles they in the meane
tyme (with as much treacherie as silence) doe heerbye
onlie gayne tyme (in working and procuring theyr owne

ends) to repayre and renewe the fortifications of that
Countrie, till in the end they (like Molewarps) have
therein taken firme footing, and made those Cities and
Castles which were easie to subdue, become difficult,
and the difficult impregnable; For the King of Spayne
playes the Practicke with your Majestie, whiles you
professe the Theorie to him; you give him contemplation
for action, hee returnes you action for contemplation;
for whiles you are entertayning and flattering your
thoughts with hoape, hee and his Factor the Duke of
Bavaria, hath crowned his hoapes and front with the
Lawrels of the Pallatynat, that daintie peece and rich
and bewtifull Prouince of Europe; neyther is it your
Maiestie alone, but the French King likewise, who hath
given too confident an eare to the Syreen tunes, and
charmes of Spayne; for whiles their practises and
machynations threw him to a pernitious & sacrilidgious
Warre against his owne Protestant subjects, then Spayn
recovered the Valtolyne, and deflowred the Fortes and
passages of the Grisons, and whiles he (by his Gondomar)
lull'd your Maiestie asleepe with the melodie of the
Match, then hee finished the Conquest of the Pallatynat.
Onlie your Majesties dishonnor heerin is farre greater
then that of the French King; because his remisnesse
permitted but his Confederates to bee ruyned, but your
Maiestie, your Confederate your Sonne in Lawe, your
onlie Daughter his wife, and their Royall posteritie.
Thus as the Cyclope Polephemus devoured his passengers
one after another, soe doth the King of Spayne ea
                  •
               e upp
whole Countries and Provinces. And wherto tends all

this formidable Ambition, power, and greatnesse of his,
but onlie to fill the sailes of his glorie; Whiles your
Matie. and other Potentates and Princes of Christendom
most inconsideratlie (I may say shamefullie) ride at
Anchor in the Portes of false securitie, and therfore of
true danger; and wherunto tends all this, but in the end
to aspire to the whole Empire of the West, as your
Majestie heard though would not beleeue, from your last
Assemblie of Parliament, which our sinnes, and your
Enemies, caused you to make and intitle but a
Convention.
            
            All Europe can beare witnesse of your Majesties two
yeares pious, interceeding, and Christian endeavours
and resolution, to have the Palatynat restored by Treatie,
and although the Emperour hath superficially promised
and the King of Spayne artificiallie vowed it; yet still
your Majestie sees contrarie effects, and still they fortifie
the Pallatynat, not for, but against the Prince your Son
in Lawe, as if they had given a Definitive sentence and
periode to theyr resolutions, and made it an Orthodox
Article of their Fayth, still to keepe and never to restore
it to him, or his posteritie; yea, the Emperour is soe
glutted with his victories, and the Duke of Bavaria soe
sursetted with his good fortunes (in both which the
King of Spayne insults with joye, and triumph with
exhileration) that they are now soe farre from thincking
of restitution, as they disdayne it; Alexander the Great,
(whose generositie was yet farre greater then his fame)
shewed such testimonies of his moderation and
Magnanimitie, as hee gave those whome he subdued and

conquered, more cause to reioyce then repyne at his
Victories, yea hee shewed infinit Vertue and Charitie in
his power, (and these twoe cannot bee better shewen
then in giving lymitts to power.) But it seemes the
Emperour is continuallie soe inflamed with choller, and
transported with revenge towards the Count Pallatyne,
your Sonne in Lawe, as hee is whollie unmindfull eyther
of Charitie or Vertue, hee mought have added glorie to
his Victories and Raigne, if his Ambition finding
prosperous successe, could have beene content with
measure and moderation soe uecessarie in all Christians,
and soe requisit and relucent in Princes; But what or
whie speak I of Charitie or Moderation in the Emperor,
when all the world can testifie with mee, that his quarrell
is soe implacable, and his malice and revenge soe
inexorable to the Prince Pallatyne your Sonne in Lawe,
and the Princes and Nobles of Germanie his adhaerents,
as hee hath given them all just cause to flye to such
remedies as dispayre gives to necessitie, therby to seeke
to preserue their lyues with their honnors, and their
honnors with their lyues. And as hoape mought but
feare cannot bee capable in them to declyne their vallour
and courage; soe had they not then reason to banish
hoape, when they apparantlie sawe they could hoape for
nothing but for Dispayre in the mercylesse mercie of the
Emperour. Hee leaves them still proscripts, although it
had beene farre more Noble for him (whoe holdes the
first, and noblest Rancke of Christendom) rather to have
made them taste the fruytes of his mercie, then to feele
the effects of his Indignation; and is still so erreconcilable

and vindictiue, as if hee hath vowed to adopt, and make
revenge a Vertue, and resolved and sworne, that it shall
bee the last thing which shall die with him.
            Neyther cann your Majestie justlie conceyue, that this
inveterate malice of the Emperour, and boundlesse
Ambition of the King of Spayne, is onlie bent and
intended against the Prince Pallatyne, your Sonne in
Lawe; but likewise (by vertue and reason of the same
rule of Vsurpation) against your royall selfe. Sith wee
cannot cutt a finger, but wee wound the Arme, nor cutt
offe an arme, but wee indanger the whole Bodie; And
what doth this Imperious swallowing downe of the
Pallatynat by the Emperour, the perfidious usurping of
the Cantons, of the Grisons, and the eager threatning the
totall subversion of the Netherlands, by the King of
Spayne, else portend and implye, but onlie to cut off
the letts, and obstacles, that with the more facilitie they
maye after make theyr approaches to assayle your own
Kingdoms & Domynions; which treacherous designes
and resolutions of theirs, if your Majestie will not now
beleeue, and accordingly seeke and endeauour to
prevent; It is to bee feared, yea I saye agayn, it is to bee
feared, that wee yonr Subjects shall feele them hereafter,
when wee shall have just cause left us to lament, but
neyther meanes, power, nor tyme, to remedie and
prevent it. For thincke what your Majestie will, and saye
what you please, yet your best subjects, and not the
woorst Witts and Statesmen of your Kingdoms knowe,
that when the Emperour and King of Spayne, beate
Princelie Fredericke the Sonne, that at that verie instant

and act, they undoubtedlie threatned Royall Iames the
Father; and that (in the loss of the Pallatynat) your
Majestie uppon the whole, is dangerouslie wounded and
strucke at through his syde, aswell in the honnor of your
Sacred person, as in the wellfare and safetie of your
Estates and Kingdoms.
            Give not cause O Great King, that the malice of the
Prince your Sonne in Lawes Enemyes prevayle aboue
your pittie and affection, nor theyr Vsurpation aboue
your Iustice, and although some Spanish Englishmen, and
English Spanyards, playe the Mercurie with you, to bring
the Argus eyes of your judgment and power asleepe,
seeming to have new Mynerva's inclosed in theyr braines,
therbye to inchant your sences and to cast your affection
and Vnderstanding into a Lethargie; yet it will bee a just
and honnorable resolution for your Majestie, that in
regard the Emperour will affoord noe favour to the
Count Pallatyne your Sonne, that therfore (according
the sence and letter of the same rule) hee deserves to have
none given or shewen him by your Majestie his Father
in Lawe; and as your Royall hart is the Temple of
Equitie and Iustice, soe can there anie thing bee more
just and equitable, then to make the Vsurper restore;
yet it is as necessarie as just, for your Maiestie to cause
this restoration of the Pallatynat; sith to speake to the
Emperour, or King of Spayne, of the restitution therof,
is but to speake to the wynde, And it is to deceiue your
Majesties deepe knowledge, and to betraye your solide
judgment, to thincke that ever it will bee restored, except
by your Sword. Noe, noe, it must bee your Sword, not

your Tongue, not your Treaties, not your Letters, not
your Ambassadours which must refetch it, if ever your
Majestie desire and intend to haue it refetched, For all
other meanes are fledd, and have now abandoned and
forsaken you, and this of Warre is onlie left you to effect
it, which will not fayle, nor cannot deceive you in the
performance therof; For otherwise like Ptolomais in
(Suydas) you maye pleade your selfe to death in
expectation and hoape therof by Treaties, before you
see it restored. And that the policie of the Emperour,
the King of Spayne, and Duke of Bavaria, maye in all
respects equalize theyr Ambition and Malice, in the
resolute and constant Detention of the Pallatynat; maye
it please your Majestie agayn and agayne to cast the
eyes of your Consideration, to see how closlie they have
dealt with the Pope, to fulminate and thunder out from
his Vatican some false and irreligious Aphorismes, therbye
the better to over-vayle and the more authentically to
couller out, the monstrous Deformitie of this theyr
Vsurpation therin; Wherof, of his 29. I will at this
present content my selfe to select & propose unto your
Majestie the three last.
            
               1.
               27. That it is not now in the power, eyther of the Emperour,
or the King of Spayne, to replace Frederick and his Heyres
in the Pallatynat and Electorat.
               2.
               28. That it is an uniust request of the Kinges of England,
and Denmarke, and of the Electors of Saxonie, and
Brandenbourg, to seeke to revoke the Popes Confirmation

of the Duke of Bavaria in the Pallatynat and Electorat.
               3.
               29. That the Pope cannot revoke the Confirmation of the
Pallatynat and Electorat to the Duke of Bavaria, without
preiudice to the authoritie of the Sacred Catholique
Church.
               
            
            Thus the Pope, or rather thus the King of Spayne and
the Emperour, whoe have caused the Pope, falslie and
maliciouslie to pronounce a sentence and Decree in their
owne favour, agaynst the Lawfull right of the Count
Pallatyne, you Sonne in Lawe, and his Heyres; wherbye
your Maiestie maye palpablie see, and plainlie observe,
the letts and difficulties, yea the impossibilitie which
your Majestie maye expect, for the restoring of the
Pallatynat. And although I justlie confesse my selfe (for
Power, Learning, and Iudgment) to bee the verie
meanest of all your Majesties subjects; yet because I
more triumph in my Fidelitie to you my sacred
Souveraigne, and in my zeale to all your Royall
Posteritie, then the Emperour doth in his Imperiall
Crowne, the King of Spayne in his Indyes, or the Duke
of Bavaria in his newe Conquest and usurpation of the
Pallatynat; I therfore most humblie beseech your
Majestie to pervse and consider these three Aphorismes,
which I returne to the Pope in answere of his.
            
               1.
               
                  That it is nowe in the Iustice of the Emperour, and in
the power of the King of Spaine, to replace the Count
Pallatyne Frederick (and his Heyres) in his Pallatynat and
Electorat.
               
               
                  2.
               
                  That it is a Iust, Charitable, & Honnorable resolution
of the Kinges of England, and Denmarke, as alsoe of the
Electors of Saxonie, and Brandenbourg, eyther with theyr
pennes or swordes, to seeke to annihilate and frustrate
the Pope his Confirmation of the Pallatynat and Electorat
to the Duke of Bavaria, in favour of Fredericke and his
Heyres, and that theyr Connivencie now therin towards
the Pope, will infalliblie prove Crueltie to themselues,
and theyr owne heyres for ever heerafter.
               3.
               
                  That the Decrees of the Church and Consistorie of
Rome, are revokable, as having noe affinitie and
resemblance with those of the Meades & Persians, and that
the Pope and his Colledge of Cardynalls, can when they
please revoke theyr Confirmation of the Pallatynat and
Electorat to the Duke of Bavaria, and restore it to the
true owner therof Fredericke Count Pallatyne, and his
heyres, without anie newe or farther prejudice to the
authoritie of theyr Catholique Church; Sith if it were for
the obtayning of their owne ends, or the propagation
of theyr Romish Religion, as it is for our Protestant; not
onlie everie age but almost everie Popes raigne, abounds
with presydents of the same nature; which those are
infinitlie blynde whoe see not, and extreamlie partiall,
ignorant, or malicious whoe will not acknowledge.
            
            And because (in my shallowe concceipt and capacitie)
it is pittie that these three Aphorismes of the Pope, should
returne without Interest; I therfore adjoyne and send
his Holliness these other three to my three formes,

which in all Humilitie and Dutie I likewise prostrate to
your Maiesties pervsall & consideration.
            
               1.
               
                  That the Princes Electors of Germanie maye make
an Emperour, but that the Pope cannot make an Elector,
nor consequentlie unmake one, beeing made, because it
meerlie and properlie belongs to a Civill power, and not
to an Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction.
               2.
               
                  That the transaction and Donation of the Pallatynat
and Electorat, made by the Pope from the Count Pallatyne
your Sonne in Lawe, to the Duke of Bavaria, doth both
subvert the fundamentall Lawes and Dignitie of the
Empire, and alsoe oppose and assault the prerogatives
and safetie of Germanie, and of all other Kinges, Princes
and Free Estates of Christendome.
               
               3.
               
                  That the Connivencie of the Emperour, and Princes
Electors, in tollerating the Popes sayd transaction and
Donation of the Pallatynat, as aforesayd, openeth a Doore
to the unjust intrusion of Rome, over the Libertie,
Souveraigntie, and indepencie of Germanie, which
hencefoorth will never bee in the power, eyther of
the Emperour, or of the Princes Electors agayne to make
fast and shutt, if now they doe not.
            
            Having thus given six Aphorismes to the Pope for his
three, I now agayne in all humilitie and Dutie embolden
my selfe, to recommend to your Maiesties Gracious
pervsall and consideration, three tymes three others,

which I direct and send joyntlie to the Emperour, and
King of Spayne, or rather agaynst them to your Maiestie,
and the whole world, therby to unmaske theyr Ambition
and Vsurpation, in the unjust detention of the Pallatynat,
from the Illustrious Prince your Sonne in Lawe.
            
               1.
               
                  That the Emperour invaded the Pallatynat by the
Counsell and Instigation, and Conquered it by the
Armes and Threasure of the King of Spaynes, and without
it hee could never have Conquered it; And it is cleere
and notorious to all the world, that as the Emperour
cannot subsist without the assistance of Spayne, that
therfore in his Detayning of the Pallatynat; that the
King of Spayne, is more your Sonne in Lawes, and your
Maiesties enemie, then the Emperour: for take away the
cause and the effect followes, as take away fuell and the
flame and fire will bee soone extinguished.
               2.
               
                  That those whoe knowe the Court of Rome, doe
apparantlie knowe and Confesse, that without the close
interceeding, and secret solicitation of the King of
Spaynes Ambassadours and Ministers, to that effect in
that Court; that neyther the Emperour nor Pope, had
dared eyther to have taken the Pallatynat and Electorat,
from the Count Pallatyne your Sonne in Lawe; to
whome by all the Lawes of Heaven and Earth it
appertayneth, nor to have given them to the Duke of
Bavaria, whoe hath no other right nor clayme therto, but

onlie that which his excessive Ambition, and insatiable
desire of Vsurpation suggests and gives him.
               3.
               
                  That it is in the power of the King of Spayne, to make
the Emperour and the Duke of Bavaria restore the
Pallatynat and Electorat to the Count Pallatyne your
Sonne in Lawe, and therfore that if they restore it not,
that then your Maiestie may iustlie and trulie conclude,
it lyes not in his will.
               4.
               
                  That it is as easie for the Prince Pallatyne your Sonne
in Lawe, to bee restored to his Pallatynat and Electorat
by the helpe of your Maiesties sword, as impossible for
the Emperour and Duke of Bavaria to keepe it without
the assistance of the King of Spayne.
               
               5.
               
                  That as long as the Pallatynat and Electorat is
detayned and possessed by the Emperour and Duke of
Bavaria, soe long (to common sence, and unprejudicate
judgments) it is as cleere as the Sunne, that their Lawe
in the Detention therof, is whollie and solie derived,
from the will and resolution of Spayne, which is theyr
Cynosura, wherbye they steere all theyr actions, and
theyr Delphos, from whence they fetch all theyr Oracles
and Instructions.
               6.
               
                  That it is a Castillian policie, to make the Archdutchesse,
                  
a Negotiatrixe in and for all Treaties depending
betwixt your Majestie and the Emperour for the
Pallatynat and Electorat, and that shee beeing a verie
olde and sicklie Princesse, having as it were her Lyfe
on her Lippes, and her feete on the brincke of her
Grave, That when shee Dyes the sayd King, will then
cause all her promisses, Contracts, and assurances to dye
with her, and to bee lykewise buried in her Grave, which
are or which may bee anie way displeasing, or opposite
to his ambitious Designes and resolutions.
               7.
               
                  That if the King of Spayne take not the reall and
actuall possession of the Pallatynat, during the lyfe
of the Duke of Bavaria; that hee will infalliblie doe it
immediatlie uppon his Death; And in the interim, the
Cardes are soe cunninglie shuffled betweene them,
that uppon the Whole, Bavaria is but Spaynes Depositor,
and the King of Spayne, Bavaria's Patrone and
protector.
               8.
               
                  That the restoring of the Pallatynat, which your
Majestie makes a matter of Estate, the quenchlesse
revenge of the Emperour, and the boundless Ambition
of Spayne, have caused the Pope to make it meerlie a
matter of Religion.
               
               9.
               
                  That your Maiestie shall in the end finde, that Spayne,
to have the fuller pretext, and fayrer couller for his

Ambition, in causing this injust Detention & Vsurpation
of the Pallatynat; will for his last shift and imposture,
clappe the whole fault therof on the Pope, by affirming
hee nowe sees that it whollie derogates from the
Honnor and Office of Christs Vicar, and consequentlie
from the Lawes and Constitutions of the holie
Catholique Church; for Clement IX. to annihilate and
revoke the Donation of the Pallatynat and Electorat, to
the Duke of Bavaria, which his Predecessor Gregorie XV.
gave him, and that hee beeing the Catholique King, hee
dares not transgresse the Commaunds, nor disobey the
will and Decrees of the Pope, whoe is the head of the
Catholique Church, the Successour of Sainct Peeter, and
Christs Vicar on Earth.
            
            These Aphorismes most sacred Souveraigne, are true,
not feigned, and everie way worthie of your beleife and
Consideration; For your Maiestie shall in the end
finde, that the Emperour and the King of Spayne, will
not understand the language of Restitution, because theyr
Swordes and Pennes have ever practised and professe
the Contrarie. Yea, you have small cause and lesse
reason to apprehend or feare the Emperours power,
whoe indeede is of verie small or noe power, without
that of Spayne. And if Spayne will still Countenance
and Commaund this his usurpation of the Pallatynat,
then hee is your Sonne in Lawes Enemie, as much, or
more▪ as the Emperour, and soe to bee esteemed and
held of your Maiestie, and noe osherwise. And for the
rest of the Germane Princes whoe syde with the

Emperour; you have noe cause to stand eyther in neede
or in feare of theyr Forces & power, for although the
honnor of the Empire bee frequent in theyr tongues,
yet theyr owne Interest and endes, are more deeplie
rooted in theyr hartes, and take upp the first place in
their resolutions.
            Your Majestie hath a long tyme, yea too long tyme
looked from the Prince Pallatyne your Sonne in Lawe,
in suffering him thus to bee Dejected and deprived of
his Pallatynat; yea, and the whole world spare not to
speake and affirme this truthe; that you are more
desirous of rest then of Honnor, in permitting and
tollerating it; Hee is a Prince fuller of hoapes then of
misfortunes, and his Vallor and Vertues, make him
more Worthie to bee an Emperour, then to bee
beaten by an Emperour. And all these crosses and
losses of his; are but the assaults of Fortune, the
exercyse of his patience, and the tryall of his generositie
and Constancie. Your Majestie hath seene him ruyned,
and yet it lyes in your power and pleasure to repayre
those ruynes of his, and to make him as happie as now
hee is miserable.
            Looke uppon the Princesse, his wyfe, and your
onlie Daughter, and you shall finde that all her
Husbands misfortunes and losses, doe noe way blemish
but rather Illustrate her vertues, as if her fortitude
and resolution, were to Devyne to bee outbraved
by anie earthlie Crosses and afflictions. For the
remembrance of Reason & Honnor, of her Blood and her
Vertues, comming to forme it self in her understanding,

makes her to entertayne different accydents and
afflictions with an aequall erected constancye, and
although shee have onlie this Comfort and Consolation
left her, that shee is not the cause of her Misfortune;
yet those whoe fee her Bewtie, and knowe her Vertues,
doe likewyse knowe, that shee whoe is one of the
Greatest Ladyes of the world, should not bee reduced
to this poynt of myserie and misfortune, to bee one
of the Poorest and least of the world; Sir, God
hath made her your Daughter, and our Princesse, and
adorned her with soe manie Vertues, as shee rather
deserves to bee Empresse of the whole world, then
Ladye of a small Province; Shee inheriteth the Name
and Vertues, the Majestie and generositie of our
Immortall Queen Elizabeth, and is a Princesse of such
excellent hoapes and exquisite perfections, that I
cannot speak of her without prayse, nor prayse her
without admiration, sith shee can bee immytated by
none, nor parraleld by anie but by herselfe; And yet
will your Majestie neglect her, and will you not
drawe your Sworde in her just Quarrell, vvhose
Fame and Vertues hath drawne most hartes to adore,
all to admyre her.
            Looke uppon those Princelie plantes theyr Children,
and your Majestie shal finde, that theyr lookes and fronts
doe alreadie in their Infancie, justly threaten to revenge
their Father his losses and indignities; and sith they
are Descended from your Royall Blood and loynes,
will your Majestie suffer them to bee ruyned,
as soone as borne, and that the Greatnesse of

theyr Blood should onlie serve to make theyr afflictions
and misfortunes the greater; Harmlesse and Innocent
soules, what have they done to your Maiestie, that you
should suffer them thus to bee Disinherited, or rather
what should not Nature prompt you to doe for them,
agayne to restore them to theyr Patrimonie and
Inheritance; For if you will affect them you must
pittie them, and you cannot sufficientlie pittie them,
except you remedie and revenge theyr wronges, by
repayring the ruynes of theyr decayed and Shipwracked
fortunes, in that of theyr Fathers.
            All the actions of Demetrius savoured of Royaltie,
and none will soe much royalize your Raigne, and
immortalize your Fame, as this of restoring your
Children to their Patrimonie; your famous Predecessors
and Progenitors of eyther Kingdom, were too generous
sencible and Delicate to digest or packe upp the least
affront or injurie whatsoever, though from the greatest
Princes and Potentates of the world, much lesse soe
great a one as is this of the Losse of your dearest
Childrens Patrimonie, from soe weake a Prince as the
Emperour, (whose power gives the lye to his forme, and
comes farre too short of his Dignitie and reputation)
wherin the Honnor of your Sacred person, and alsoe of
all your Kingdomes and Estates, doe most extreamlie
(O that I might not saye shamefullie) suffer, for they
made it both theyr practise and glorie to strike those
first, whoe made but the least shew or shaddowe, eyther
to threaten them, or to withholde that from them which
they ought to restore; Yea, they have past the Seas with

royall Fleets and Armyes, aswell for Defending theyr
Confederates, as for keeping and reconquering of a
poore Cittie; And will not your Maiestie then take
Armes, for the regayning and restoring of soe rich a
Province as the Pallatynat, to the Prince your Sonne in
Lawe, to the Princesse your Daughter, and to theyr
Royall posteritie, which is one of the goodlyest
Countries of Europe, and wherin there are soe manie
strong Citties, and Castles.
            And as the French (in Rome) give out agaynst the
Duke of Savoy, that the delayes which the Pope made in
the judgement of the Marquisat of Salusses were
insupportable, that they had too long Disputed and
pleaded for theyr owne, and that therfore it was high
tyme (yea more then tyme) for them to decyde that
quarrell with the Cannon, in the playnes of Piedmont;
Soe hath your Majestie just cause to saye to the Emperor,
the King of Spayn, and Duke of Bavaria, for the restoring
of the Pallatynat; yea let your Courage but animate
your Designes, and your Subiects will execute them;
For, give them but the worde of Commaund to resetch
it by Warre, and your Majestie will then see they will
act wonders with theyr Swordes, not onlie answerable
to your desires and expectation, but beyond the
Emperours, the King of Spaynes, and the Duke of
Bavaria's beleife, and your Nobilitie and Gentrie (out of
theyr true zeale and innate affection, to the famous
Princesse your Daughter, her Husband and Posteritie)
will flye from Thames to Rhyne, as to a Fayre, or
Wedding, and you shall have more Gentelmen in this

action, then ever Germane Armie beheld, or Spanish
confronted. And although money (which is the true
cyment and synewes of Warre) seeme now scarce in your
Kingdomes, and that your Bounties hath made your
Exchequer, and Treasor emptie; yet if your Majestie
will be pleased to secure but this one doubt and feare of
your Subjects, that your Souldiers may eate, and not
your Courtiers devoure the monyes which a Parliament
will give and rayse you for this enterprise, you shall
then assuredlie finde an Indyes in your England, and more
huge sommes of mony cheerfully Contributed, then that
action can anie way take upp or expend; you shall finde
that one Herauld will doe more good then all your
Ambassadors have performed. And as the Mathematicians
hold, that the rightest and straightest Lyne is still the
shortest; Soe your Majestie shall undoubtedlie finde, that
the rightest and shortest way for you to recover the
Pallatynat will bee by your Sword. When Scotland was
not yet added by your Majestie to England, England
(holding herselfe bound in poynt of Honnor) hath sent a
blacke Prince into Spayne, a Drake and Essex, into Portugal,
and an Essex, Willoughbie, Norrice, and Fourbisher into
France, with statelie Fleets and Regiments, to restore
Disinherited Kinges to theyr Kingdomes, whoe were yet
but our Confederates, and will not your Majestie whoe
hath so happilie Vnited and Wedded Scotland to England,
and whoe is the powerfullest Monarch that ever swayed
the Brittish Sceptre, attempt and performe the like for
the Prince Pallatyne your Son in Lawe, and the Husband
of your onlie Daughter our Princesse; our hands, harts,

and swordes, beeing of as good, and of as excellent a
temper as ever our Predecessors were, having as it were
hands of Steele, and hartes of Diamonds, for the attempting
and finishing of this Honnorable Enterprise; If the
King of Spayne will not abandon his Cousen the Emperour,
should your Majestie abandon, or rather should
you not assist and protect the Count Pallatyne your Son
in Lawe, agaynst the Emperour. Or if there ensue hereon
anie breach betwixt your Majestie & the King of Spayn;
hath he not given you just cause to undertake that warre,
which is soe Iust, Honnorable, and Charitable, as to the
eyes and censures of the whole world, it beares its
perswasion with it; And if your actions and resolutions
be such, that you resolve rather to give Spayne cause to
feare you, then to take anie to make your Majestie feare
Spayne, your Maiestie shall then infalliblie fetch securitie
out of danger, and drawe honnor out of shame; yea,
if you wil couragiouslie resolve to cut this Gordion knot
with Alexander, and to passe this Rubicon with Caesar,
you shall then trulie and tryumphantlie participate of
the ones Fame, and of the others Glorie; and this indeed
will make your Maiestie live after Death, and reviue
agayn in your fame, as the Phaenix doth out of her ashes.
And noe sooner shall your Drummes beate, and your
Coullers bee displayed uppon the banckes of Rhyne;
but your Majesties sword shall put a newe face uppon
Germanie, and make England (consequentlie) assume her
olde one, which was ever woont to looke more Martiall,
and lesse Effemynate, lesse contemptible to our Friends,
and still more terrible to our Enemyes.
            
               
It is an action and resolution full of Religion, full of
Equitie, and full of Glorie, whervnto the honnor of your
Kingdoms, and your Royall person, and your Maiesties
naturall affection towards your Princelie Children, doth
both envite and conjure you to attempt and perfect it;
It is a worke and labour infinitlie worthie of your Sword,
your Sceptre, your Crowne; yea, it will bee one of the
most precious Iewels and Diamonds, which your lyfe,
can possiblie give to the adorning of your Raigne or
your Death, to the embellishing of your Tombe or
Chronicle; Is the recoverie of the Pallatynat a great
action? Consider I beseech you, that you are a Great
King & a Potent Monarche; doth it produce difficulties?
what important enterprise ever was, or can there bee
without them, or what cannot the hartes and swordes of
Great Brittayne make easie, and as success comes some
tymes short of our hoapes, soe manie tymes it goes
beyond them; doth it threaten Danger? whie there is the
more Glorie to surmount it, and beeing well and firmlie
begunne it will bee alreadie halfe ended; Sith there is
nothing more Couragious then a good Cause, nor more
Victorious then the Truthe.
            And although your Majestie delight and glorie to bee
tearmed, A Prince of Peace; yet lett your Peace live
and flourish in Honnor, and not wyther and dye in
Contempt and shame. For God, whoe is the Protector
of Princes, will rather releeve then ruyne them, and
rather desire and authorise theyr restoration to, then
theyr deprivation from theyr Countryes, and it will bee
farre easier to beleeve then to represent, the joy which all

the best and truest harted of your Subjects will conceyue,
when they shall see your Majesties sword, as deeplie
ingaged in the quarrell of the Pallatynat, as your Sceptre
and Honnor is in the cause therof; Our famous Elizabeth
did beate Spayne, and shall our Royall and Potent King
IAMES feare it; Besides, we see our trustie Neighbors
and Friends the Hollanders, relye uppon the poyntes of
theyr Swordes for the preservation of theyr Estates and
Lyues; and therin they infalliblie finde, the securitie of
the one, and the safetie of the other, by Detecting and
Detesting the Treacheries of Spayne, which is still more
prevalent and powerfull in theyr calmes of Peace, then in
theyr tempests of Warre, and it will bee noe small
felicitie to your Majestie, to see (these valiant and
constant Confederates) how couragiouslie they will
second your Warlike attempts in this restoration, and
how constantlie and resolutelie they will marrie theyr
Forces to yours, and with theyr best powers, pushe
foorth the Chariot of your triumphs agaynst the House
of Austria.
            
            Proceed Great King with this action soe full of
Glorie and Honnor, and the God of Heaven and Earth
make your Majestie still happie in your Peace, and
victorious in your Warres; And because it is a difficult
poynt to satisfie our selves and the tyme together; yet
(notwithstanding) I hope that your Majestie will pardon
this boldness and affection of myne; except it bee held
a Crime to honnor my Kinges Daughter, and to desire
the prosperitie and welfare of the Prince her Husband,
and theyr Royall posteritie; which next unto that of

your owne sacred Majestie, and then of the Illustrious
Prince Charles your Sonne, I will neyther cease to doe
with my best zeale, nor fayle to performe with my
most religious wishes and
prayers.
            
               From my Chamber, in your Citie of
London, this New-yeares Eue, and
I beseech the Lord to give your
Maiestie manie happie and ioyfull
newe Yeares and Dayes.
