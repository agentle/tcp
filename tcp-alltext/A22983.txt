            To the honorable Maſter
THOMAS WILSON, Doctor
of the Ciuil lawes; one of hir Maiesties
principal Secretaries, and
of the moſt honorable priuie
Counſel: Grace and
peace in our Sauior
Christ.
            
               AMong Chriſtians
it is & hath bin for
longe continuance
an ancient cuſtome,
Honorable, at this
time, and at this daie commonlie
of the yeere, either to purchaſe fauor,
if they haue none; or to confirme
friendſhip, which they haue,
with giftes and preſents. Hence
both hie eſtates, to them of lowe
calling; and meane perſons, to
their betters; and euerie friend to
his wel-willer lightlie wil ſende
ſome token, if his habilitie doe
ſerue of a friendlie hart and affection.
            In the daie two ſpecial things
are to be obſerued. One is, that

our Sauior Chriſt was circumciſed
herevpon; another that the newe
yeere beginneth now. If we ſhowe
arguments of loue one toward another,
for that we haue perceaued
the loue of our Sauior to vs ward,
by his natiuitie, circumciſion, and
ſuffering in ye fleſh for our ſakes1. Pet. 2, verſe. 21.;
doubtles our cuſtome is a Chriſtian
cuſtome: if otherwiſe, becauſe
the new yeere beginneth, we ſeeke
new loue, or a renuing of old good
wil, it is a Ciuil cuſtome; commendable
in either reſpect, yet vſed
in both, it better pleaſeth God.
            I therefore hearing of the good
opinion, which it hath pleaſed
your Honor to conceaue of mee,
haue thought no time coulde be
better than now, by ſome preſent
both to thanke your Honor for
the ſame, and to craue the continuance
thereof, til by euil demeanor
I ſhal deſerue the contrarie.
            My gift which I doe offer is for
price of no great value; ſuch as a
poore Student may preſent. For as
the Perſians.Aeliamus variae hiſt. lib. 1. from the richeſt to
the pooreſt, woulde gratifie their
Kings with giftes and rewardes,
ſome with golde, as Noble men;
ſome with ſilke, and ſpices, as Marchant

men; and ſome too with ſimple
apples, and plums, and ſuch
like frute, as Husbandmen, who
had no better to giue: So, though
perſons of Honor may giue you
gold and iewels; marchants veluet,
ſilk, and ſpices; rich men coſt
               
                  •
               ie
rewardes: yet can a poore la
               
                  •
               orer
in the garden of Chriſtian
knowledge, giue no better than
ſuch as he hath, apples and plums,
euen the frute of his ſtudie, and
trauel.
            Notwithſtanding, ſmal for price
though it be, I haue good hope
your Honor wil accept it wel in
woorth, both for the matter it containeth,
which is ſo holie; and for
the maner of handling the ſame
by the auctor, which is ſo heauenlie,
that, in my iudgement, neither
Historia Animalium, which Ariſtotle
gaue vnto Alexander the
Great; nor that of Cicero De Republica,
which Cardinal Poole
ſought after with the expence of
2000. crownesR. Aſcham Ioan. Sturmio, Epist, l. 1. p. 37. b. Nor finalie thoſe
sibyllian works, that Tarquin. Priſcus
bought ful deerelie of AmaltheaLactant. de falſa ſap. cap. 6., are ſo profounde for knowledge;
nor manie big volumes of
Philoſophie, for methode ſo exquiſite;

nor al ye bookes of humanitie,
ſo neceſſarie for vſe, as it is.
            Which I doe write, neither to
diſſuade anie from the reading of
thoſe, nor to perſuade your Honor,
to conceiue wel of this booke.
For I verilie do thinke, that both
they are commendable, yea, and
neceſſarie too, applied to their due
endes; and that your Honor conceaueth
better of this, than I by
writing can expreſſe, being, as you
are, for your wiſedome, an honorable
Counſeler; for your learning,
a reuerend Doctor; by your
ſundrie good, & neceſſarie bookes,
a famous Writer; and for your
zeale, a valiant oppugner of ſin
and wickednes.
            But as I thinke therof my ſelfe:
ſo doe I write. In which reſpect I
haue not ſhunned paines to adorne
the ſame with places of
holie Scripture. For, ſeeing the
booke, by peruſing it to mine vnſpeakable
both profite and pleaſure,
to ſauor moſt fragrantlie of
the flowers and ſentences not of
humane, that is vane wiſedome,
but of Gods holie word; and to
be as holie for phraſe, as for matter
holie; being wholie taken out

of the holie Scripture: me thought
were the places of Scripture annexed
in the margine, it would be

                  •
                quick ſpur, not onlie vnto the
true Chriſtians zealouſlie to read
this ancient and godlie Father,
when they ſhould ſee al his ſentences
in a maner to be nothing
but verie Scripture; but alſo vnto
Papiſts, who, neglecting Scripture
cleaue ouermuch vnto this, and
other Fathers of the Church, to
reade the Scriptures, when they
ſhould perceaue al his delight to
be in vſing the verie words of the
holie Ghoſt.
            Wherefore both for the bringing
the Scripture into more credit
with al Papiſtes; and this holie
Father with ſome Proteſtantes;
and his methode, and maner of
handling the Scriptures, to be a
perpetual monument of imitation
vnto both, I haue added the places
(the more willinglie through
the earneſt inſtigation of ſome
godlie perſons, eſpecialie of the
Printer heereof, whoſe good nature,
and zeale, as it is not vnknowne
to your Honor, ſo is it wel
knowne to the Church of Chriſt,
by his careful, and orderlie imprinting

good bookes) and now
haue publiſhed my dooings vnder
the protection of your Honor.
            Which my paines, if I ſhal perceaue
to be wel taken of the godlie,
chiefelie of your wiſedome, I
purpoſe, God aſſiſting me, to proceede
in ſetting forth after this
ſame order, not onlie the auctors
Manuel and Meditations, but alſo
diuers and ſundrie of S. Auguſtine
his workes beſide: that the verie
Papiſtes may ſee, though they
know it wel ynough alreadie, that
Augustino plurimùm tribuamus, as it
is wel giuen out of vsR. Aſcham. Ioan. Sturmio. li. 1. Epiſt. pag 16. b..
            But, me thinkes, I heare ſome
aduerſaries among themſelues on
this wiſe ſpeaking, His quoting we
condemne not, and his tranſlating
we allow, but by his preſumptuous
parting of Sentences, and correcting
ſuch a Doctor, he plainelie
ſheweth, that he is by the one ouer-curious,
and by the other a
ranke Heretike.
            May it therefore pleaſe your
Honor to heare my reaſons of doing
what I haue done, the which if
your wiſedome do like, I ſhal not
weigh, what anie either Zoilus of
enuie, or aduerſarie of malice will

thinke.
            Touching my parting of the
ſentences, I did it vpon theſe occaſions:
Firſt, to imitate thoſe good
Bookes out of which they were
borowed, that is, the ſacred Scripture.
For ſurelie, in mine opinion,

                  •
               t were not wel, the Booke beeing
moſt notablie deriued out of the
pure fountaines of Gods holie
word, if it were ſet forth in anie other
forme, than is the ſpring from
which it flowed.
            Secondlie, that the Reader
might the more ſenſiblie perceaue
the mind and methode of the auctor.
For, I dare ſaie it, by this parting
or ſeuering of the ſentences, a
more cleere light of the auctors
minde wil appeere to him, who
gladlie woulde vnderſtande the
ſame, than when they are confounded,
or not parted.
            Thirdlie, to offer cauſe of deepe
contemplation to the zealous
Chriſtian. For there is no ſentence
almoſt throughout the Booke,
which is vane, but moſt heauenlie,
and able to make euen him
who is fartheſt from Chriſtianitie,
to occupie his minde with holie
and deepe meditations. Therfore,

albeit they can be placed in no
forme amiſſe, yet then beſt do they
profit, and mooue the mind, when
they are parted.
            Laſt of al, for the better diſpoſing
the places of Scripture by the
Printer, I haue diuided the ſentences.
For had the Booke bin printed
in that letter which other Bookes
of Meditations, ſet forth by me,
are done withal, as I thought it
would, then ſhould the places,
they are ſo plentiful, neuer haue
ſtoode in good forme, nor ſight, as
in ſome part of this Booke may appeare,
notwithſtanding the letter
be verie great, in mine eie, for ſo
ſmal a volume.
            Now concerning the ſeconde
point, it ſtoode me vpon, both for
my owne credite, and alſo for the
behoofe of others, to leaue ſomwhat
out. For had I not ſo done, I
ſhould haue ſaid, that the hands of
GOD, Manus inquam illae quae affixae
clauis ſunt pro me
               Soliloq. cap. 2., did make
mee: I ſhould haue ſaid, that the
light which was made, when God
ſaid, Let there be light, was Angelica
ſcilicet natura
               Soliloq. cap. 8.: I ſhould haue
ſaid, that the Angels, as for diuers
other ends, ſo for this are appointed,

               Vt orationes filiorum Dei offerant
in conſpectu maiestatis ſuae
               Soliloq. cap. 27.. I ſhould
haue ſaid, that the ſame Angels do
bring Gemitus nostros at
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   ſuſpiria ad
Deum, vt impetrent nobis facilem Dei
benignitatis propitiationem, & referant
ad nos deſideratam ſaue gratiae benedictionem
               Soliloq. cap. 27.:
I ſhould haue ſaid, that
our Sauiour deſcended into Hel,
Vti ſedebant in tenebris patres nostri
               Soliloq. cap. 32.:
I ſhould haue ſaid, that Chriſt aſcended,
Aſſumpta ſecum ex inferis
captiuitate, quam captiuauerat antiquus
ille hostis, humani generis inimicus
               Soliloq. cap. 32.:
finalie, I ſhould haue ſaid,
that we ought to doubt, An ad portum
ſalutis peruenire valeamus
               Soliloq. cap. 35., quia
omnia infuturum reſeruantur incerta:
and ſo where my purpoſe was to edifie,
I ſhould haue deſtroied the
ſoules of the weake with erronious
opinions. Beſide, I ſhould haue
cooled the zeale euen of the
ſtrongeſt, when thinking to proceede
in holie meditation, they
ſhould find ſuch ſtumbling blocks
of error caſt in their waie. And
therefore did I iudge it better to
leaue them quite out, though it
greeue the Papiſtes, than to leaue
them in, either to the deſtruction
of ſome, or to the offence of anie

good Chriſtian: marueling much
why in other Engliſh tranſlations
this matter hath not bin loked vnto
ere this, and theſe faultes not
wholie, as in part they be, amended.
            And heere I beſeech your Honor,
euen for Gods glorie; the furtherance
of the Goſpel; and commoditie
of this land; that among
al abuſes which you ſtudie to reforme,
as a godlie Magiſtrate, and
ought to informe hir Maieſtie of,
as a prudent Counſeler, you would
remember the hurt that commeth
by corrupt bookes in our Engliſh
tong. Firſt, they infect the mindes
of the ſimple; ſecondarilie, they
offend the godlie; and thirdlie,
they confirme the obſtinate, and
the more a great deale, becauſe
they are allowed by publike auctoritie,
and not either diligentlie
corrected, or orderlie forbidden.
            Againe, cal into mind thoſe
bookes which do more hurt than
they, namelie, the inchantments
of Circes brought out of Italie,
and ſuch vngratious workes, either
tranſlated out of Italian into
Engliſh, or imitating wholie the

Italian inuention. Ten Sermons at
Paules Croſſe
               Maiſter Aſcham in his Schoolmaiſter. booke. 1. pag. 26., do not ſo much good for
moouing men to true doctrine, as one of
thoſe bookes doe harme, with inticing
men to il liuing. Yea, I ſay further, thoſe
bookes tend not ſo much to corrupt honest
liuing, as they do to ſubuert true
religion. Mo Papists be made by your
merrie bookes of Italie, than by your
earnest bookes of Louaine. This foreſee
ſubtile Papiſts.Pag. 27. 
               Therefore when
the buſie & open Papists abrode could
not by their contentious bookes, turne
men in England fast inough from truth
and right iudgement in doctrine, than
the ſubtile and ſecret Papists at home,
procured baudie bookes to be tranſlated
out of the Italian tong, whereby ouermanie
yoong wils and wits allured to
wantonnes, doe now boldlie contemne al
ſeuere bookes that ſound to honestie,
and godlines.
               Pag. 27. b. Which bookes open, not
fond & common waies to vice, but ſuch
ſubtile, cunning, new, and diuers ſhifts
to carrie yoong wils vnto vanitie, and
yoong wits vnto miſchiefe, to teach olde
baudes new ſchoole points, as the ſimple
head of an Engliſh man is not able to
inuent, nor neuer was heard of in England
before, yea when papistrie ouerflowed
al. Suffer theſe bookes to be read,
and they wil ſoone diſplace al bookes of

godlie learning: for they carrieng the
wit vnto vanitie, and marring good maners,
ſhal eaſilie corrupt the minde with
il opinions, and falſe iudgement in doctrine:
first to thinke il of al true religion,
and at last to thinke nothing of
God himſelfe. And that which is most
to be lamented, and therfore more needful
to be loked vnto, there be mo of theſe
vngratious bookes ſet out in print within
theſe few monethes, than haue bin
ſeene in Englande manie ſcore yeeres.
And becauſe our Engliſh men made Italians
cannot hurt, but certaine perſons,
and in certaine places, therefore
theſe Italian bookes are made Engliſh,
to bring miſchiefe inough openlie and
boldlie to alestates, great and meane,
yoong and olde, euerie-where. So that
now they be ſolde in euerie ſhop in
London,
               Pag. 26, b. 
               commended by honest titles, the
ſooner to corrupt honest maners, dedicated
ouer-boldlie to viriuous and honorable
perſonages, the eaſelier to beguile
ſimple and innocent wits.
            
            Theſe are the words, as your
wiſedome ſmelleth I am ſure, not
of a yong wit, but of a graue head;
nor of a meane Scholer, but of the
beſt Schoolemaſter that euer England
bred, and therefore not lightlie
to be ouer paſſed, nor quicklie

to be forgotten, but with earneſt
endeuor oftentimes carefulie to
be recorded, as good counſel expreſſed
from an hartie good-wil
with rare eloquence, tending to
the glorie of God, and benefit of
this our Countrie, that neither
ſuch as are wel giuen may be alienated
from virtue, nor thoſe
which are il bent, prouoked vnto
wickednes, through baudie, beaſtlie,
and blaſphemous Bookes.
            Laſt of al, remember, I humblie
once againe in the bowels of Ieſu
Chriſt beſeech you, remember
another abuſe that hurteth more
than both thoſe which I haue alreadie
mentioned; namelie, prophane
Plaies, publikelie vſed, ſet
foorth as banners of open defiance
to the Goſpel, and godlines,
& that vpon Holi-daies, yea, and
in thoſe places to (I meane the Vniuerſities
for learning, and London
for reſort) which ought to be
the Lanternes of godlines vnto
al the land beſide. Preachers euen
the graueſt for wiſedome and
yeeres; and the greateſt for zeale
and knowledge; & not the ſmalleſt
for auctoritie, euerie-where
crie out vpon them ſo zealouſlie

with ſuch griefe of hart, that they
are euen tyred againe with crieng.
Doctors condemne themCyril. Catech. 1. Mystag. Tertul. lib de Spect.:

that the Magiſtrate, our ſoueraigne
Magiſtrate I meane, would
vtterlie forbid them publikelie to
be vſed, that the common people
might not haunt them, and al
ſhould be wel!
            But to returne to my purpoſe
from which I haue digreſſed, theſe
errors, I feare mee, haue cauſed
manie to doubt, whether S. Auguſtine
were ye auctor of this booke;
but being left out, as nowe they
are, I cannot ſee, why S. Auguſtine
might not make the ſame, the
matter is ſo heauenlie, praiers;
the words ſo holie, Scripture; euerie
thing ſo wiſelie, orderlie,
excellentlie done by the auctor,
that he muſt needes be a moſt excellent
man, whoſoeuer made the
ſame, and a more excellent than
S. Auguſtine among the Doctors,
I thinke was neuer none.

vnto thy mercie.
               I became wretched, and was
broght vnto nothing, yet knew
I not ſo much; for thou art the
truthIoh. 14, 6., and I was not with thee.
Mine iniquities did wound me
Ezra. 9, 7. Pſal. 38, 4. 5., yet was I not trobled; for
thou art the lifeIoh. 14, 6., and I was not
with thee. They brought mee
vnto nothing; for thou art the
wordIohn. 1, 1. Hebr. 1, 2. 3., & I was not with thee,
by whom al things were made,
without whome nothing was
madeIohn. 1, 3.. And therefore being
without thee I became nothing.
For it is nothing which
bringeth vnto nothing.
               By the worde al things were
madeIohn. 1, 1. 2. whatſoeuer was made,
& after what forme ſoeuer they
were made.
               And God ſaw al that he had

madeGen. 1, 31. Eccl. 39, 16. 33. Mark. 7, 37., & lo, it was exceeding
good. Al things yt were made,
were made by the worde: then
whatſoeuer things were made
by the worde, are exceeding
good.
               Wherefore be they good? Becauſe
al things were made by
the word; and without it was
made nothing, yt was madeIohn. 1, 3..
For nothing is good without
the ſouereigne good.
               But wheras good is not, there
is euil, which indeede is nothing,
becauſe euil is nought
elſe, but the want of good:euen
as blindnes is naught elſe, but
the want of ſight.
               Euil then is nothing, becauſe
it was made without the word,
without which nothing was
madeIohn. 1, 1. 3..
               And that is euil, which is depriued
of that good, wherby al

thinges that are, were made.
But thoſe things which be not,
are not made by him. And
therefore they are nothing.
               Then whatſoeuer was not
made, are euil. Becauſe al
things that were made, were
made by the wordeIohn. 1, 1. 3.. And al
which were made by the word,
were exceeding goodGen. 1, 31 Eccl. 39, 16. 33.: wherefore
forſomuch as al thinges
were made by the worde, euil
things were not made by it.
               So it remaneth, that whatſoeuer
things were not made, are
not good: for al things are good,
which were madeEc. 39, 16. 33.. Therefore
the thinges not made, are euil:
and ſo conſequentlie nothing.
Becauſe without the word nothing
was madeIohn. 1, 3.. Euil then is
nothing, becauſe it was not
made.
               But how is euil, if it was not

made? Becauſe euil is a priuation
of that which good is, thorough
which good was madeGen. 1, 31.
Then to be without the worde,
is euil; which is to be as nothing.
For beſides it, is nothing.
               But what is it to be ſeparated
from the worde? If thou wouldeſt
knowe that, liſten what is
ment by the word.
               The word of God ſaithIohn. 14, 6, I am
the waie, the truth, and the life.
Therefore to be ſeparated from
the worde, is to be without the
waie, without the truth, without
life, and ſo nothing without
him: and ſo euil, becauſe it is
without the worde, by whome
al things were madeIohn. 1, 1. 3., and they
were excellentlie goodGen. 1, 31. Eccl. 39, 16. 33..
               Againe, to be ſeparated from
the worde, by which al thinges
were madeIohn. 1, 3., is nothing elſe
but to vndo; and of ſomething

to become nothing. For without
him it is nothing.
               As often therfore as thou declineſt
from that which good is,
thou ſeparateſt thy ſelfe from
the word. For that is good. And
ſo thou art made nothing, becauſe
thou art without ye word,
without the which was made
nothing that was madeIohn. 1, 3..
               Now then, ô Lord my light
Mica. 7, 8., thou haſt inlightened mee,
that I may ſee thee. I haue ſene,
and knowen, that as often as I
am ſeparated from thee, ſo oft I
become nothing. Becauſe I forgat
goodnesDeut. 32, verſe. 18. which thou artMatth. 19, verſe. 16. 17.;
and therefore am made euil.
               Wo worth me wretch that I
neuer marked, how I became
nothing when I forſooke thee.
But what needes this cōplaint?
If I was nothing, I needed not
to knowe.
               
                  
We knowe that euil is nothing;
and that is not, which is
nothing: and that which is not
good, is not, becauſe it is nothing.
               If therefore I was nothing,
when I was without thee; I was
but as nothing euen like an Idol,
which is nothing1. Co. 8, 4., hauing
eares, and heareth notPſ. 135, 17 16.; a noſe,

                  SO then as long as I
was without thee,
I was naught but
verie nothing: and

therefore blinde I was, deafe I
was, and without ſenſe. For I
neither knew what good was;
nor ſhunned that euil was; nor
perceaued my wounds when I
was hurt; nor ſaw the darknes
which I was in. Becauſe I was
without thee, the verie lightIohn. 1, 4. 9.,
which lightneth euerie man
that commeth into the world.
               Alack therefore, they wounded
me, yet I ſorowed not; they
haled me, yet I perceaued not,
for that I was not; becauſe I
was without lifeIohn. 14, 6., which is the
wordeIohn. 1, 1. 3., by whome al thinges
were made.
               And therefore, ô Lorde my
lightEſa. 60, 19. 20., mine enimies did with
me euen what they would; they
ſtruck me; they ſtriped me; they
polluted me; they corrupted

They dragged mee after them
in their circuite frō vice to vice;
and from mire to mire; and ſo
went I ful weakely, God knowes,
before the face of him that
purſued me.
               Bond I was, yet liked I ſlauerie;
blinde, and deſired blindenes;
bound, and did not abhor

ſweet, and ſweet to be ſoureEſai. 5, 20..
               Miſerable I was, yet knewe I
not ſo much: becauſe I was
without the worde, without
which nothing was madeIohn. 1, 3.,
through which al thinges are
maintained, without which al
thinges are brought to nothing.
               
                  
For as al thinges by it were

               And when it hath thee, it hath
her harts deſire; neither is there
anie outwarde thing beſide,
which it would wiſh. But while
it deſireth anie outward thing,
it is a manifeſt argument, that
thou art not within. For if thou
be had, it can wiſh for no

                  I Haue gone aſtraie

And much haue I labored to

find thee without me, and thou
dwelleſt within meeRom. 8, 9. at leaſtwiſe
if I had a luſt to thee.
               I went about by the lanes, and
by the ſtreetsSal. ſongs. 3, verſe. 2. of the citie of this

thee not. Becauſe I ſought thee
not rightlie without, who art
within.
               I ſent abroad my meſſengers,
namelie al mine outward ſenſes,
to ſeeke thee; yet did I not
finde thee; becauſe I ſought amiſſe.
               For now do I ſee, ô my lightEſai. 60, 19 Micah. 7, 8.,
ô God, which haſt inlightened
meIohn. 1, 9., I ſee now that I did not
wel in ſeeking thee by them.
For thou art within, yet could
they not tel me, where thou cameſt
inIob. 9, 11..
               For mine eies do tel me; If
he had no color, he entered not
by vs: Mine eares do tel me; If

he made no noiſe, he paſſed not
by vs: My noſe telleth me, If he
had no ſent, hee came not by
me: My taſting ſaith, if he had
no ſauor, he entered not by me;
likewiſe my feeling doth ſaie, If
he had no bodie, aske not mee
the queſtion.
               Therefore, ô my God, theſe
things are not in thee. For it is
neither the fairenes of bodie,
nor the beutie of time, nor the
brightnes of light, nor ye freſhnes
of color, nor the melodie
of muſicke, nor anie thing elſe
which is pleaſant to the eare; it
is neither ye fragancie of floures,
nor the ſmel of ointments or
ſpices, nor the ſweetenes of honie
or manna, delightful to the
taſte; neither is it thoſe things
which are louelic to be touched,
or embraced; nor finalie anie
thing ſubiect to theſe ſenſes

which I ſeeke, when I ſeeke my
God. Be it far fro my thought,
that I ſhould thinke theſe things
to be my God, which are comprehended
of the ſenſes euen of
brutiſh creatures.
               And yet when I ſeeke my
God, I ſeeke for al that a certaine
light excelling al light,
which the eie cannot comprehend1. Cor. 2, 9.;
a certaine ſound excelling
al ſound, which the eare can
not conceaue; a certaine ſent,
ſurpaſſing al ſent, which the
noſe cannot diſcerne; a certaine
ſweetenes, excelling al ſweetenes,
which no taſte can judge of;
and a certaine embracement, aboue
al embracement, which no
feeling can reach vnto.
               For this light ſhineth, where
no place is to containe it; This
voice ſoundeth, where no aër
is to carie it; this ſent giues a

ſent, where no wind is to waſte
it; this ſauor ſauoreth, where no
taſte is to eate it; and this embracing
is felt, where it is not
ſundered. This is my God, and
there ſhal none other be compared
vnto himBaru. 3, 35. This doe I
ſeeke, when I ſeeke my God;
This do I loue, when I loue my
God.
               Too late haue I loued thee, ô
beutie ſo old and yet ſo freſh,
too late haue I loued thee! Thou
wert within, and I was without,

               Thou wert with me, but I was

not be but in theeAct. 17, 25. 28..
               I went al about ſeeking thee,
and forſaking my ſelfe for al

things.
               I asked the earth if it were my
God; and it anſwered, No: and
al things in the earth confeſſed
the ſame.
               I asked the ſea, & the deepes,
and al things creeping in them;
but they anſwered, We are not
thy God, ſeeke him aboue vs.
               I asked the puffing aër, and
the whole aër with al the dwellers
in the ſame made me this
anſwere; Anaximenes is deceauedAnaximenes was of opinion that the aër was God; as Augustine here, and Theodor. in his booke de Principijs▪ doth record.: for I am not thy God.
               I asked the heauen, the ſunne,
the moone, and the ſtars: and
they ſaid, Neither be wee thy
God.
               Then ſaid I vnto al thoſe which
ſtand about the doores of my
fleſh; Tel me, I praie you, what
thinke yee of my God? tel me
ſomewhat of him? and they al
anſwered with a loude voice, He

hath made vsPſa. 100, 3.
               Then ſaid I to the maſſe of the
whole world, Tel me, art thou

with a mightie voice, I am not;
but through him I am whome

made meeIohn. 1, 3. 10. Heb. 11, 3.; ſeeke him aboue

               The asking of the creatures is
the deepe conſideratiō of them:
their anſwere, is the teſtimonic
which they yeeld of God. For al
things crie, God hath made vsGen. 1, 1. 2. 3, &c. Pſal. 136, 1. 5. 6, &c. Eccl. 18, 1. Actes. 14, 15. Acte. 17, 24..

inuiſible things of God, are ſene
by the creation of the worlde,
being conſidered in his works.
               Then I returned vnto my ſelfe,
and went into my ſelfe, and ſaid
thus to my ſelfe, what art thou?
