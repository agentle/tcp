Remonſtrances made by his Maieſties Ambaſſadour of Great BRITTAINE, to the French King, and the Queene his Mother, Iune 1615.
            
               SIr, the title of your good Brother, and auncient Friend, wherwith the King my Maſter is truly ſtiled, doth aſſuredly perſwade him that you alſo on your part haue the like impreſſion of ſincere affection, which is infuſed and ingrafted in him by the ſucceſſiue and perpetuall continuance of that vnited amitie and alliance, which his Predeceſſors the Kings of Scotland haue had at all times with your Crowne, hath beene teſtified alſo in theſe latter daies, by the Kings of England, in their worthy and effectuall

aſſiſtance often performed vnto your State, chiefly vnto your Father, the late King of worthy memory, in the time of his moſt difficult affaires; ſo that you cannot impute any thing proceeding from him, but vnto that ſame entire affection, which his Maieſtie, on his part, deſires (if it may be) to continue, and perpetuate in his Succeſſours, both to you and yours.
            Whereupon, his Maieſtie by expreſſe command hath charged me, ſeriouſly to remonſtrate vnto your Maieſtie, for the good of your Perſon and State, and all Chriſtendome in generall; and as he aſſureth himſelfe, that all his actions and proceedings ſince his raigne, which began with his life, will iuſtifie him before you and the world, that he neuer through practicality, or curioſitie intruded himſelfe into forraine affaires, ſo hath he this teſtimonie of his conſcience, and doth proteſt before God, that the onely end and cauſe of his enter-meddling in this action, is the aforeſaid welfare of your State, and diſcharge of his owne conſcience.
            Sir, his Maieſtie hath been aduertiſed,

that your Maieſtie is reſolued ſpeedily to take your Iourney, to make an exchange of Princes with Spaine: whereupon he findes himſelfe obliged (as wel by the affection he beares vnto you in particular, as by the care he owes vnto the publike of Chriſtendome, faithfully to repreſent vnto you the great & imminent danger, wherinto, by this your reſolution, you wil plunge both the State of your owne Kingdom, and alſo of your neereſt neighbours, and beſt allios, not that hee doth counſell your Maieſtie to depart from tho contract which is already paſt touching theſe mariages. For his Maieſty knows wel, that the greatnes and dignity of Kings doth in good reaſon require, that they ſhould ſeeke the amity one of the other, and combine theſelues by ſuch alliances and leagues of friendſhip, but only to preſent vnto your view, how expedient and neceſſarie it is, (both for the conſideration and welfare of your perſon in particular, as alſo in reſpect of all Chriſtendome in generall, in this doubtfull vncertaintie, wherein the affaires of theſe times now ſtand, to remit the accompliſhing of the ſaid marriages vnto a

time more mature and opportune.
            Beſides this ancient affection, and bond of amity betweene your Crownes, his Maieſtie takes himſelfe obliged in Conſcience to performe vnto you this office, by reaſon of that faithful promiſe paſſed betweene the late King your Father of happie memorie and him; by the ſecret Miniſterie of ſome certaine of your ſeruants, and namely, the deceaſed Monſs. de Ʋitry, which was, that when either of the two departed this life, the ſuruiuour ſhould take into his care & protection, the Eſtate and poſteritie of the deceaſed. Which, his Maieſtie, preſently after that vnfortunate accident of the late Kings death, made knowne (by the Baron of Hales) vnto Monſ. de la Borderie, who was then with him, offering himſelfe to the vtmoſt of his power for the accompliſhing of this promiſe, whereof ſince the bond yet remaines in his perſon towards your Maieſty, hee cannot, for the diſcharge of his conſcience, but ſhew vnto you, and the Queene your Mother, the great wrong, which hee ſuppoſeth, is done vnto you, if, before you haue attained to that maturitie of yeeres

and iudgement, requiſite and neceſſary for your direction in the choiſe of your Wife and aſſociate, be it for the content of your affection, or welfare of your State, you ſhould be precipitated into the yoke of mariage, to the manifeſt preiudice of your health, and (may be) of your contentment and affaires; for, as touching this laſt point, his Maieſtie weighing that which publikely appeares of the cōſtitution of your preſent eſtate, the diuers iealouſies and diſcontentments of the greateſt of your Court, the ill treating of your Parliament, which without doubt hath cauſed much diſcontent in the mindes of your Subiects, in reſpect of the great credit and reputation, which this body, and principall member of your State hath with the people, beſides the grieuāces which thoſe of the reformed Religion pretend, he knoweth not how in the middeſt of theſe agitations and diſorders, your Maieſties may abſent your ſelues from the heart and center of your Kingdom, as you ſhould doe by this voyage; beſides, the leauing of your affaires here expoſed to a great deale of confuſion, and danger of diſorder.
            
               
But beſides theſe conſiderations which meerely concerne your Perſon and Kingdome in particular, the generaltie of Chriſtendome doth finde it ſelfe greatly intereſſed in the precipitation of this voyage, for if in the doubtfull and vnſettled eſtate of the affaires of theſe times, the accompliſhing of the ſame were for a certaine time ſuſpended, there would be hope, that by the common & ioynt interceſſion of all their friēds and allies, the differences which now moleſt and menace the quiet of Chriſtendom, might be ordered; whereas if in this doubtfull and dangerous Coniunction, theſe marriages be ſuddenly perfected, it cannot be in all likelihood, but there muſt enſue a general combuſtion throughout all Chriſtendome.
            For firſt, what iealouſie and diſcontent will the States of the vnited Prouinces receiue, when they ſhall ſee France & Spaine ſo ioyntly vnited? can they hope that France will then labour to cauſe the Arch-Duke to make reſtitution of thoſe places kept, and detayned in Cleues and Iuilliers, by the Marques Spinola, for the which they are

now in controuerſie with him; yea rather, will they not ſuſpect all counſels and reſolutions, to be enterpriſed to oppugne them? yes, without doubt they will beleeue, that in this Coniunction, the ill will of Spaine towards them, will ſurmount the good will of France, and that it will not ceaſe, vntill it hath ingaged this State in open enmitie againſt them. And this with great griefe his Maieſtie is forced to ſay, that if the ſame wil and reſolution had beene brought from hence, as was taken by him, for the ordering of the affaires of Weſell, thoſe points and puntillioes whereon ſo long time the Spaniards haue dwelt, to prolong this affaire, might haue beene long agoe cut off: but now on the cōtrary, he hath cauſe to grieue, that hauing as much labored to ſollicite the interuention of this State in this affaire, as to draw the Spaniard to ſome reaſon; notwithſtanding all this importunitie, he could neuer procure any other anſwere from hence (neither touching this point, or the other affaires) but in generall termes, witneſſe that weake ſatisfactorie anſwere preſented vnto his Maieſtie, by Monſ. de Buiſſeaux,
               
as alſo all the other anſwers to the ſollicitations of the Princes of Germany.
            Moreouer, theſe Princes of the Vnion, knowing that Spaine is the Fauourer and Protector of their Enemies, will receiue no leſſe damage and diſpleaſure by the accompliſhing of theſe mariages, thus proſecuted without any neceſſity, and ſo out of ſeaſon, that they will not only weaken them by the loſſe of France, but alſo ſtrengthen their Enemies by the aduantage of this Cōiunction. And who can ſecure them from feare, (if the troubles of Sauoy can be appeaſed) that the Army of Spaine, which now threatneth Italic, doth not come expreſly by the forbearance of this State, to fall vpon them, and in particular, the Elector of Brandenbourg, who hath ſo long timerelyed vpon France, cannot hereafter expect any fauour from hence for the deciding of his controuerſie, ſeeing that the King of Spaine hath taken the Duke of Newenbourg, his Competitor, into his protection?
            As for the Duke of Sauoy, who is deſcended from this Crowne, and whoſe preſeruation doth much concerne it, as well for

the neereneſſe, as for the ſituation of his Countrie; if before the accompliſhing of theſe marriages, hee hath found France ſo violent and diſcourteous towards him, as well by the harſh and peremptorie meſſages, which haue been ſent him from hence, as by the rigorous inhibitions publiſhed in disfauour of him, declaring all ſuch as goe to aide or aſſiſt him, offenders of his Maieſtie, and ſo vſing them, by confiſcation and razing of their houſes, (a thing neuer heard of, nor practized, eſpecially by France, towards a Prince and Friend, ſo vexed and oppreſſed by the Armes of one ſtronger then himſelfe) how may he hope, after the conſummation of the ſaid marriages, that this State will remaine an impartiall Arbitrator betwixt Spaine and him, or that theſe Miniſters which ſhall be imploied in his buſines, will deale faithfully and ſincerely for the good of his affaires, his Maieſtie proteſting for his owne part that his deſire hath and euer ſhall be, firmely to vnite himſelfe with your Maieſties, to incite the ſaid Duke vnto peace, howbeit he iudgeth it fit to haue an equall care, leſt by ſuch disfauour, he might

be inforced to accept of conditions vnſafe and preiudiciall?
            And ſince that the greateſt Honour of France, during the wiſe gouernement of the late King, was the authority and truſt which it had, prudently and profitably to prouide (as it hath done vpon diuers great and important occaſions) for the accommodating of differences betweene forraine Princes and States, to the conſeruation of the publique peace of Chriſtendome, and ſeeing that it is already apparent, that the ſhaddow of theſe double alliances doth miniſter cauſe of feare to your ancient friēds, that together with them the intereſts alſo of Spaine will be eſpouſed, it is moſt certaine, that the precipitation of theſe marriages wil much augment this feare in them, cauſing France to loſe that authority and truſt which their Councels haue had alwayes heretofore on their part, turning their confidence into diſtruſt, and their loue into diſcontent.
            If therefore, notwithſtanding all theſe weighty and vrgent conſiderations, which concerne ſo neerly the perſon of your Maieſtie,

and the Weale publique, aſwell of your owne State, as of your Neighbors and Allies, you ſhall haſtily proceede to the cō
               ſummation of this voyage; what may they imagine, who in this State, and alſo among your Neighbours doe clearely perceiue, weigh and apprehend theſe pregnant conſiderations, but that thereby there is ſome hidden deſigne tending to their preiudice?
            Laſtly, the King my Maſter ſhall haue iuſt cauſe of regret in his owne particular, if hauing liued ſo many yeeres in loue, and correſpondency ſo firme with this Crowne, inſomuch that theſe two States (hauing had almoſt one & the ſelfe ſame to will, and not to will, the ſame Friends and Enemies) haue alwayes ioyned their Counſels, and guided their actions in all affaires and occurrances, tending to the Weale publique, after one and the ſame manner: Now France diuerting it ſelfe from him, by the precipitation of theſe Marriages with Spaine, ſhall leaue vnto him alone the burthen and charge of all ſuch affaires and differences, as yet remaine in Chriſtendome vndecided; howſoeuer notwithſtanding his Maieſtie is not

ignorant of the aduantage, which elſewhere is offered vnto him by this alienation, if he were a Prince ambitious to winne vnto him ſelfe alone the good will and friendſhip of all thoſe ancient Allies, which by this action ſeeme abandoned, if he alone ſhould not enterpriſe the managing of their affaires, as hee will neuer bee wanting either by aſſiſtance or counſell, to effect the ſame, when neceſſity ſhall require. But being not able on his part ſo ſleightly to forget & renounce the ancient correſpondence & Coniunction, which hee hath hitherto maintayned with this Crowne, hee is willing to vſe all care and meanes for the preſeruation of it in its owne eſtate, before hee change his courſe, or addreſſe himſelfe to new counſels, if he be not thereunto conſtrayned by this ſudden alteration.
            And this is it that his Maieſty hath charged me, thus freely to repreſent theſe foreſaid conſiderations vnto your Maieſty, beſeeching you to accept and embrace this his aduice, euen as he preſents it vnto you, that is to ſay, with his true and ancient affection for the good of your Perſon and State, and

the zeale he beareth vnto the weale publike of Chriſtendome, that you would be pleaſed ſo to diſpoſe of your reſolutions hereupon, in this moſt weighty occaſion, that his Maieſty may enioy the contentment, and you the fruit which he earneſtly deſireth.
         
         
            
            
               
A Declaration made by his Maieſties Ambaſſadour of Great Brittaine vnto the French King, and the Queene his Mother, concerning an Oration made by the Cardinall of Perron, in the late generall Aſſembly of the Eſtates at Paris.
            
            SIr, the King my Maſter, (hauing ſeene a certaine Oration, made in the Aſſembly of your States Generall, held lately in this City, and ſince publiſhed by Monſ. the Cardinall of Perron, wherof he himſelfe hath ſent a Copie vnto his Maieſtie) cannot ſufficiently wonder at the licentiouſneſſe, and deprauation of this age, animated with ſuch audacity by the ſpeeches and writings of a perſon of that qualitie, who, to ouerthrow a wholeſome propoſition, made in the third Chamber of the ſaid States, for preſeruation of the life and authoritie of Kings, vnder pretence of maintaining the intereſt and rights of the Pope, doth not onely expoſe and lay open as a prey, the life and States of Princes, by the doctrine maintained in the ſaid Oration, but alſo doth vnworthily ſubiect the Crowne of his owne King, to the tutelage

and authoritie of the Sea of Rome; and thirdly, doth ſend forth, without any reſpect, diuers reproches and iniurious inuectiues againſt the Perſon and Gouernment of the King my Maſter.
            Firſt therefore, his Maieſtie complaines, and takes in ill part, that the ſaid Cardinall, in diuers places of this ſpeech, publikely maintaines, that a King by the Law of God may fall from his Right, and ceaſe to be acknowledged as a King. That a Pope or Councell hath authoritie, particularly in caſes of Hereſy or Apoſtafy, to depoſe Kings, and abſolue Subiects of their oath of Alleageance, and that conſequently their Subiects may enterpriſe againſt them. Which were not only to put the State and Temporall dignity of Kings, into the hands and diſpoſing of the Pope, but alſo diſobedience into the hearts of their Subiects, and a knife into the hands of Aſſaſſines, to execute vpon their Sacred perſons, the decrees of a will tranſported either by error or malice vnto their ruine; whereof, within theſe fiue and twentie yeeres, this Kingdome hath felt too too lamentable & remarkeable effects.
            
               
Secondly, the ſaid Cardinall, applying this execrable Maxime, in particular vnto France, maintaines, that it hath alwaies been receiued and authoriſed here, yea, ſometimes for crimes of Religion, leſſe weightie then Hereſie or Apoſtafie: And if any hold the contrary, the Popes do but tolerate the ſame for the good of the Churches peace, conditionally that they hold it as doubtfull, and Problematicall, and not affirme it contradictorie to the word of God; by which meanes, your Maieſties Life remaines continually expoſed to the ſame danger and enterpriſes, that your two Predeceſſors felt.
            Thirdly, his Maieſtie findes himſelfe greatly offended in particular, by the language, that the ſaid Cardinall vſeth of him and his actions, chiefly, that vnder pretence of gratifying his perſon, he rankes him (as much as in him lyeth) in the number of Pagans, commending him onely for his vertues, Morall and Naturall, without attributing vnto him any Chriſtianitie at all; wherin his Maieſtie glories principally.
            Secondly, he accuſeth him of malice and

faction, affirming that he hath enterpriſed to ſow Schiſme and deuiſion in this aſſembly of the Eſtates, and in the States of this Kingdome, endeuouring thereby, to bring in the ſame Article and oth, which himſelfe impoſeth on his own ſubiects, and which is worſt of all, deſcribes him in his Gouernement, as if he were a bloudy Tyrant, and as if no ſort of torments could be deuiſed, which he inflicteth not vpon his Catholike Subiects, whom he preſents ſighing, and as it were, breathles vnder the yoke of perſecution; & at the end of this diſcourſe (by way of Antitheſis) ſaith, that, God bee thanked, the French are not vnder a King that maketh Martyrs. Inferring thereby, that the King of great Brittaine is ſo cruell and vnmercifull, as he taketh pleaſure in the effuſion of the bloud of Innocents.
            But his Maieſtie being content to trample vnder his feete, all theſe opprobries and iniuries, which concerne but his own particular, ſtandeth not vpō any reparation with the Cardinall, but onely eſteemeth himſelfe obliged, and ſhould thinke himſelfe defectiue and wanting in that, which God and

nature hath made him to bee, if he did not teſtifie vnto the full, the ſenſible apprehenſion, which he herein hath, touching the honour, ſafetie, and dignitie of Kings in generall; which the ſaid Cardinall by this Maxime and pernicious ſpeech of his, doth abaſe and ſubiect to the diſpoſing of another.
            This is that which his Maieſtie hath commanded me liuely, and ſeriouſly to remonſtrate vnto this State, to the end, that your Maieſties, and my Lords of your Counſell, opening your eyes to ſee and apprehend (as is requiſite) the ſcandall, danger, and pernicious conſequence of this doctrine, aſwell in generall to all Chriſtendome, as to the State of France in particular, may ſpeedily prouide a forcible remedy for the choaking of the ſeede hereof. And more particularly, his Maieſtie out of the impreſſion of that hearty and ſincere amitie, which was betweene him and the late King, whoſe loſſe he daily deplores, and whoſe memory hee honours with all reſpect in his heart, hath charged me to ſhew and call to your Maieſties remembrance, that during the life of the ſaid King, they contracted this amiable

accord, and brotherly agreement, betweene them in ſuch ſort, that when it ſhould pleaſe God to take vnto him one of the two, the Suruiuor ſhould vndertake as Father and Protector of the childrē of the predeceaſed.
            And for this cauſe, his Maieſtie (deſiring to acquit himſelfe of this obligation and duty, which he beareth to the remembrance of him, whom he ſo faithfully loued during his life) cannot but declare the liuely feeling and commiſeration, which hee hath of the miſerable and perillous eſtate of your Maieſtie his moſt deare Brother, which is continually in danger, if the doctrine of the Cardinall be receiued & allowed in France.
            
            And therefore his Maieſtie, for the diſcharage of his conſcience, and dutie of his quality, deſires, and requires this ſtate, openly to manifeſt to the view and knowledge of all the world, (by publike and rigorous ſuppreſſion of the oration of the ſaid Cardinall, and by a ſolemne decree touching the ſame) their diſauowing and condemning of this new and accurſed doctrine, to the end, that by this declaratiō, the licentious Spirits of your ſubiects may the better bee kept in the duty of their fidelitie and obedience
         
         
            
            A Letter from the French KING, to the Prince of CONDE.
            
               COVSIN; I haue oftentimes giuen you to vnderſtand the deſire which I had, that you ſhould accompany me in my voyage which I intend to make into Guyenne, for the accompliſhing of my Marriage, and haue inuited you to prepare 
                  •
               our ſelfe for the ſame, and to repaire vnto me for that purpoſe: I haue alſo made knowne vnto you my good meaning touching ſome points, whereof you deſired, before your returne, to be informed, aſwell concerning the affaires generall, as others, hauing to that effect ſent diuers times vnto you Monſ. de Villeroy, who is with you at this preſent, by whom alſo you might haue beene certified, and aſſured, of my affection

and good will, as alſo of the Queenes my Mother, towards you. Notwithſtanding hitherto, I cannot know your intent in this buſineſſe, hauing yet had nothing but delayes on your part. In the meane time being forced to take my iourny, I ſend Monſ. de Pont Chartrain my Counſellour & Secretarie of State in thoſe parts, with the ſaid Monſ. de Villeroy, 
               
                  •
               o
                  •
               ſignifie vnto you, that my reſolution is to begin my ſaid voyage vpon Saterday, the firſt of the next Moneth, without any further delay, and to deſire you againe in my behalfe, to come and accompany me, and there to take the place which is due to your qualitie and birth; or to declare your minde in the preſence of the ſaid Monſ. de Pont Chartrain, if (contrary to that hope I haue euer had of

you) you intend to make refuſall, or difficulty, and denie me this content, to the end that he may bring me certaine intelligence of your intentions, being the principall cauſe of his voyage: referring my ſelfe therefore vnto that, which the ſaid Monſ. de Villeroy, and he, ſhall ſay vnto you in my behalfe, Couſin, I pray to God to haue you in his bleſſed protection.

            The Prince of CONDE his anſwere vnto the KING.
            
            SIR, hauing vnderſtood by your Letters, which your Maieſtie vouchſafed to write vnto mee, by Monſ. de Pont Chartrain, the 26. of this Moneth, the ſpeedy reſolution which you haue to vndertake your voyage into Guyenne, and the command it pleaſeth your Maieſty to impoſe on me, to goe and accompany you in the ſame, I judged that this departure ſo haſtie (without order firſt giuen to the affaires of your State, and prouiſion for the diſorders which haue beene repreſented vnto you, both by your States generall, as alſo your Court of Parliament of Paris) was but a cō
               tinuation of the ill counſell of thoſe, which are the Authors thereof, whom heretofore I haue forborne to name in my moſt humble Remonſtrances, being not willing to diſpleaſe you, Sir, nor the Queene your Mother, hoping that they would at length haue ceaſed to abuſe your Maieſties goodneſſe. But ſeeing that they continue to make vſe of your authority, for pretext and

couert of their owne pernicious deſignes, and violēt counſels too manifeſt to be now doubted of, and too publike to be tolerated and ſuffered any longer, ſeeing they tend to the ſubuerſion of your State, the weakning of your Crowne, and the ruine of thoſe of your Bloud and other Princes, and Officers of your Crowne, and principall Lords of your Kingdome. I am conſtrained, Sir, after long patience, to preſent vnto your Maieſty (in all humility and reſpect which a moſt humble Subiect oweth vnto his Prince) the iuſt reaſons which detayne and hinder me, from rendering obedience to your command. I will declare therefore vnto your Maieſty, that when I withdrew my ſelfe to Chreil, you being pleaſed to ſend thither vnto me Monſ. de Ʋilleroy, to cō
               mand mee on your behalfe to come vnto you, with promiſe made vnto mee, that your Maieſty would giue good order vnto the publike affaires of your Kingdome: I made anſwere, that (hauing beene eight Moneths at Paris, where I ſaw the beginning, proceeding, and iſſue of the Aſſembly of the States, ſuch as it was, the courſe

which was taken to ſuborne and peruert the Deputies, and fruſtrate their Counſels and reſolutions, the Parliament abuſed, and vnworthily handled, for endeuouring the ſeruice of your Maieſty; my life, and the life of diuers other Princes and Lords of qualitie endangered, becauſe I freely with them declared my aduice in your Councel, touching your ſeruice and the welfare of your State;) I ſay, my anſwere was, that I could not returne either with dignity or ſafety, vntill it had pleaſed your Maieſty to prouide for the reformation of your Councell, and thoſe publike diſorders, contayned in the Declarations of your Parliament. Whereupon, your Maieſty being pleaſed to ſend againe vnto me the ſaid Monſ. de Ʋilleroy to Clermont, with more ample authority then he had the firſt voyage, we conferred together of the reformation of your foreſaid Councell, and of thoſe Orders which he had in charge to ſhew vnto mee; and as touching the aduices of the Parliament, I reſerued to make knowne vnto him my intent, vntill that I had conferred with, and taken the aduice of other Princes, Officers

of your Crowne, and Lords, who concurre and agree in the ſame opinion with mee, and ſtand no leſſe affected to your ſeruice, the good of your State, and the eſtabliſhment of your Crowne, euen as the ſaid Monſ. de Villeroy hath ſhewed vnto your Maieſty, who taking in good part that, which he had begun to treate of, thought good yet againe to ſend him backe to the ſame place, where the ſame morning of his arriuall, wee were already entred into conference concerning the foreſaid Remonſtrāces, in ſuch ſort, that the affayres ſeemed to be brought to a good point, when the ſaid Monſ. de Pont Chartrain arriued, who deliuered vnto me your Maieſties Letters, and declared vnto me your ſpeedy departure, which depriues the Cōmonaltie of that fruit they expected by the iſſue of this Conference, and makes the affaires (which we were in hope to haue compaſſed) impoſſible to bee effected before the ſame, by reaſon of the ſuddenneſſe thereof, and by this meanes increaſeth the diſorders that are in your State; the Authors whereof, I am forced to name vnto your Maieſtic, viz. the Marqueſſe d'Ancre, and his

Wife, the Chancelor, the Cheualier of Silleny, Dole, & Bulion, who only were deſſigned in the remonſtrances of the Parliament; vpon whom I moſt humbly beſeech your Maieſtie publikely to execute iuſtice, and to ordaine, that the complaints made againſt their actions and behauiours, may be verified and admitted; and alſo, that it may bee proceeded againſt them, according to the ordinarie and accuſtomed manner, as alſo concerning the murder committed vpon the perſon of Monſ. de Prouuille, Sergeant Maior of the Towne of Amiens, by an Italian ſouldier of the Garriſon of the Cittadell, appointing that he be deliuered into the hands of the ordinarie Iudges, to draw his Inditement, according as ſo wicked a fact doth deſerue: And vntill that order for the reformation of your Counſell be taken and effected, the Declarations of the Court examined, the diſorders of the ſame preuented, and puniſhment inflicted vpon the perſons therein denoted, whom at this preſent I name vnto your Maieſtie, as alſo vpon the Italian ſouldier; I moſt humbly beſeech you

to excuſe me, if I attend you not in this your voyage; which otherwiſe I would doe, and readily will doe, if it pleaſe your Maieſtie, before your departure, to prouide for theſe things; being alwaies willing to teſtifie by my obedience vnto your Maieſtie, that I am
            
               Sir, 
               Your moſt humble, and moſt obedient ſubiect and ſeruant,
