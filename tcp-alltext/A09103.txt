            THE PREFACE TO THE READER. IN VVHICH are laid open some few examples of the singular Ignorance, Lying, and other bad dealings of M. Barlow, in his Answere to the Censure of the Apology.
            THREE thinges (gentle Reader) at the comming forth of this Booke may occur vnto thy mynd, in which thou mayst perhaps desire some satisfaction. First the cause why so idle a worke as M. Barlowes Answere is knowne, and taken to be, should be answered at all by so graue and learned a man as F. Persons was. Secondly why this Answere is published so late after his death. And last of all what opinion is to be had of M.

Barlowes talents, learnin
                  •
               , & methode in answering, or what others heere do iudge of the same.Three things declared in this preface for the Readers satisfaction. And albeit this latter may seeme to some to be of least moment for that one aduersary most commonly will hold an others writing in highest contempt, and therfore from them so much interessed, no sound iudgement may be expected: yet do I thinke it very necessary to insist most thereon, or rather am forced to the same, for that M. Barlow is so desirous of honour, as like the Ape he thinketh his owne whelp fayrest: and himselfe will needs perswade his Maiesty that he hath so answered, as that no sound Reply can euer be made thereunto. Wherfore as well for thy instruction (good Reader) as also to rectify M. Barlowes iudgement, which in this seemeth to be very erroneous, and to teach him to examine his con
                  •
               cience better before he presume againe so far, as eyther to promise to a Prince, or put forth in print; I shall set downe my opinion, & worth of his Booke, and that vpon no other grounds, then I shall produce out of the Booke it selfe, whereby thou shalt haue more light to discerne in this affaire betweene vs, and M. Barlow lesse cause to complaine of any hard measure, seeing that against M. Barlow non
                  •
                is brought to plead, but M. Barlow himselfe.
            2. To the first point then, this briefly I answere, that F. Persons hauing seene the base manner & method of writing which M. Barlow houldeth through his whole Booke,Why M. Barlowes book was answered by F. Persons.
                esteemed the worke not worthy of any answere, and so resolued with himselfe to be silent therein, and in lieu of refuting this answere to set forth the other two parts of Resolution, so long before promised by him, and so much desired of the Catholiks in England: which whiles he went about to doe,

a Copy of this answere of M. Barlow came to the Inquisitors hands, and was by them sent to the said Father with order to refute the same, perswading themselues that a booke of that bulke & argument, written by a pretēded Prelate, & dedicated to his Maiesty, could not but beare some shew of learning, and therfore was, not to be left vnanswered. And that good opinion got M. Barlow by writing in English: for could these haue but vnderstood what was written, & with what modesty and learning, he may be sure F. Persons should neuer haue bene troubled with the sight therof, but a shorter course had byn taken by casting it into the fire, the fittest element to purge such vnsauoury filth, as euery where he belcheth forth in the same against all sortes of men, wherof you shall hardly fynd any one page to be void.
            3. Now, for the stay which hath bene made in the setting forth of this worke,The cause of the stay of this edition. seeing that the said Father dispatched what he wrote in lesse then 4. mōths it being now more then 4. tymes as much since his decease, hath especially proceeded vpon the manifold other incumbrances & variable disposition of body, wherwith that party hath bene troubled to whome the worke was committed to be finished, as himselfe cō
               fesseth in the very entrance of the first Chapter of his Supplement, which he intended to haue set forth with this Booke: but growing to so great a bulke by reason of the manifold aduantages giuen by the Aduersary, it was thought better in the end, that it should goe forth a part, as making of it selfe a iust volume with some little enlargement, or addition annexed thereunto, in answere of some things obiected, forged not well vnderstood, or misalleadged by M. Doctour

Andrews, now of Ely, concerning the matters by him handled in the Supplement, whome togeather with M. Barlow he answereth with that grauity, iudgement, and learning, as will content all, yea euen his Aduersaryes themselues (if by these meanes they were to be contented:) or if that the search of truth were the center of their motion, and chiefe end of their endeauors; and not contrarily with neglect & contempt therof, to speake placentia, and write that which may pleas

            4. But touching the last point, for that I meane to make it the subiect of this Preface, I shall be more long, not for any difficulty which I fynd in the thing it selfe (for who but M. Barlow knoweth not what a weake write

And commonly none brag more then those who performe least, or vpon other occasion, then when they are most vanquished and ouercome: at least so it fareth often with M.

And is not this very confidently spoken trow yow? And is not this Minister well perswaded of himselfe, and his owne learning, that thus craketh? Audiuimus superbiam Moab, superbus est valde,

I shall begin with his ignorance, on which I meane most to insist.

               8. Besides these mistakings, for more euident demonstration of his rare talents in construction, I will set downe two examples, but very briefly, for that he shall againe heare of them both; of the one in this Treatise, and of the other by the Authour of the Supplement. The first is touching certayne wordes of Saint Gregory in his Epistle to Theodore the Emperour Mauritius his Phisitian,
                  Gregor. lib. 2. Ep. ep. 65. where Saint Gregory yielding the reason why he sent not his Letters for the Emperour to his owne Legate, but to the said Theodore, saith: Nolo eam à Responsali meo publicè dari, quia Vos qui ei familiariùs seruitis, loqui ei liberiùs & ap

            9. But what sense or construction, thinke you doth M. Barlow make of these words? Truly such, as if he were a Grammer boy, vnder some Orbilius, he would be made to feele the smart of his folly. S. Gregory (saith he) writes to Theodore the

passiue into the actiue, a Legate into a Chayre or Oracle. And is not this man more fit to be set agayne to Inspeach, and Grammar rules, then to be imployed in writing for defence of his Maiesty? I would fayne know where M. Barlow euer reade Responsalis, to signify a Chaire or Oracle, more then it doth a Pulpit, or Sermon, Lincolne Church, or Paules steeple.
            10. And to omit other incongruities, by this pittiful construction M. Barlow his Petrus de Vin

                  is should be more miraculous, then elsewhere he hath made him, and yet he makes him to write Fredericke the second his death a yeare after his eyes and braynes were out of his head. And then further, of one & the selfe same man, he maketh two: but by this new Grammaticall interpretation he shal neyther write nor reade, be one man, or two, but be metamorphosed into a Chaire or Oracle.

                  s de Vineis, and Thaddaeus Sinuessanus. Will M. Barlow say, that he sent two Chayres, or Oracles? That truely had bene a strange Embassage. Or will he tell vs, that when our King Richard the first his Embassadors went to Rome, to withstand the Bishop of Roane, complayning against him, 
                  •
               s Nubrigensis writeth (Responsales quoque Regis è vestigio secuti, in conspectu summi Pontificis in faciem illi restitere. The Embassadours also of the King presently following, resisted him to his face before

the Pope) that he sent Chaires or Oracles to Rome? Or were these Chayrs or Oracles so earnest before the Pope in his defence? I know not whether this thing deserue rather laughter or compassion: Laughter, for that it is so foolish and ridiculous in it selfe: Compassion to see one to beare himself for Bishop of Lincolne so ignorant, as to translate Responsalis, for a Chaire or Oracle, with this insulting adiection to the same, (much lesse by his Breue interdict.) But let vs come to the second.
            11. The other example of his Grammaticall construction is concerning a place of Bellarmine about the authority of Kinges, where the Cardinal refelling an obiection that the exemption of Clergy-men from tributes, and appearing at secular tribunalls, is de iure humano, and so may be repealed by Princes, answereth, that it doth not follow,
                  Bellarm. l. 1. de Cler. cap. 28. 
               both for that not only Kings, but Popes and Councels haue giuen this exemption to Clergy-men: as also for that the whole world hath consented to the same, which hath bestowed vpon Kinges that power which they haue. So he. Now let vs heare M. Barlow conster these words: thus then he Englisheth them:
                  Barlow pag. 342. 
               Orbis terrae, t'is within the compasse of the inferiour orbe, from whence is giuen to Kinges that power which they haue. So he. And let him turne ouer againe his Grammaticon or Māmatrecton Cooper, or Calepine, and he shall neuer fynde these two wordes which himself setteth downe in latin, to wit, orbis terrae, to signify, t'is within the compasse of the inferiour orbe:A strange construction of Orbis terrae.
                and therefore perhaps his wits were without that compasse when he wrote it, and likewise his honesty was scant at home, when within 3 leaues after, out of this selfe same Chapter he cyteth in different letters, and many of them capitalls,

this passage, as the expresse wordes of Bellarmine
                     •
                   The Clergy is not bound to obey Kings, longer then Kings are THEIR SVPERIOVRS: and that is,

                  •
               . Respondeo negando. But let him read the place that list, and he shal find no such thing. And what then will yow say to such forgery & falsity? But for these two pointes I referre him to the Author of the Supplement, where they are more largely discussed. And were not M. Barlow of a seared conscience, and his cause desperate, he would neuer vse such legier-de-main, and discredit himself in this base manner. If his Spartans ready for the combat, can fight no better, it were more for his Maiestys honour, and their owne honesty, that they kept themselues out of the field, & staid at home to tend gooslinges, then thus to betray their cause, and shame all. From Grammar let vs come to Philosophy.
            12. It seemeth that in this science M. Barlow is very meanly seene,M. Barlowes ignorance in Philosophy. and not to haue read, or (which I rather thinke) not to haue vnderstood Porphyries Introduction to the same. For what puny-Sophister is there in Oxford, or Cambridge, who knoweth not that, species producatur de pluribus differentibus numero? But quite contrary M. Barlow tells vs, that the powder-plot was not singular from all examples, there hauing bene the like done by Protestants (though not in specie, yet in indiuiduo) as at Antwerp &c. which is asmuch, as if one should say: Although so grosse ignorance as we see in M. Barlow of Lincolne, cannot be found in any other man, yet is it to be found in many M. Barlowes: whereas

               M. Barlow, of whome we speake, is but one and the selfe same man, and ignorance may be found in other men as well as in him, especially if they be Ministers as he is: but of this also he shall see more in the ensuing Discussion. And doth not he deserue to be brought againe ad inferiora subs

                  llia, and to sit amongst the Sophisters in Cambridge, till he hath learned to speake more like a Philosopher?
            13. Againe what more sollemne foolery can there be, then so ignorantly to insult vpon his ad
                  •
               ersary, for saying, that S. Leo in a certayne place spake of vnity of names, as M. Barlow doth, for thus he sayth:
                  Leo ep. 89. 
               What learning will iustifie that phrase of speach, An vnity of names &c? And againe, that one name imparted to seuerall persons, should be called an vnity, let all the Onomasticks, and Nomenclators, or Mathematicians, or Schoolemen be searched, and t'will not be found. So he. Doe you not thinke that this man hath searched far into the matter, read all bookes, and seene what all say, that so resolutly and generally pronounceth this sentence? & yet Aristotle could tell him, that all aequiuoca, vniuoca, analoga, agree in one name: and none but one, as ignorant as M. Barlow, will deny that the name Father agreeth to men and God, but in different manner; so that it is true to say, that the name of Father is all one in God and man, though in nature it differ. And what can be required more to the vnity of names? Or can M. Barlow conceaue that they haue one name without all vnity? Truly as well, as conceaue, that a man may be a foole, without foolery, or as simple as himselfe, vvithout simplicity.
            14. And if this thing in no Schoole man can be found, then must S. Thomas be blotted out of that rāke,

whose wordes are:

                  li vnitas nominis non sufficit ad vnitatem enuntiationis. Aristotle sheweth, that vnity of name sufficeth not for the vnity of a proposition. And in his Quodlibets he expresly proueth this vnity of names, which he calleth vnitatē vocis, the vnity of appellatiō, for that els there were no vniuoca. But of this also he will heare more then he would, or euer will be able to refell by the Author of the Supplement. It sufficeth me to detect only his ignorance, which as it is here, both grosse and palpable, so also combyned with singular arrogancy and pride, in so resolutly affirming, that no learning will iustifie this speach; when as Aristotle, and S. Thomas the great Philosopher, and most learned of all Deuines, do both teach and demonstrate the same.
            15. Another exāple in this kind I might here produce, touching his doctrine of contradictions, and his grosse mistaking of the same, but that will come after in due place to be discussed, where I examine his dispu

In historyes what greater ignorance can there be committed then to relate fictions for truth, which haue no coherence eyther in place, tyme, or persons? And yet M. Barlow doth this so confidently, as he did the former of vnity of names.
               
                  Barlow pag. 298. Let one example suffice for this matter, by which alone the Reader may of himselfe coniecture of the rest. Alexander the third is charged to haue sēt Fredericke the first his picture to the Turke, that he might by the same know him, & kill him also, if he came into his hands, and that euen whiles he was fighting the Lords battailes: which obiection M. Barlow saith, pincheth the Pope to the quick. And I must

confesse, that had the matter bene as he doth relate it
                  •
                none can deny, but it had bene very barbarous indeed. But in the last chapter of F. Parsons ensuing Discussion, it is shewed, and conuinced most euidently, that Alexander was dead at least 7. yeares before that Frederick euer thought of going against the Turke, and eight before he came into Armenia. VVhat ignorance then is there in this Minister, so to write and triumph vpon lyes? How shall his Auditory belieue what he teacheth them out of the pulpit, that blusheth not to vtter such false and iniurious slanders in a printed booke?
            16. I might heere most of all insist vpon his dealing with Pope Innocentius the fourth, whom he relateth to haue done many things against Frederick the second,

                     •
                  rick, many years before Innocentius was Pope. And yet such a writer is M. Barlow, as that he will not only ascribe all vnto Innocentius, but also from that supposall, draw this most malicious inference
                  •
                That he went about to poyson the said Emperour. What more blind ignorance, and malicious dealing can be imagined then this? But for that this is afterwards very largely handled in the last Chapter of the ensuing Discussion, I will here no further treat therof: nor yet of his telling the Reader out of Binnius & Cicarella, that Pope Sixtus statua of brasse was, for that he was extremely hated, after his death cast downe &c. which all Rome,

in the battaile, boldly to aduenture vpon any thing, be it neuer so false, fond, or improbable.

Parsons, but could exemplify in no particular, In storyes he is a great florisher, but a false relator of them.
            
            17. Neyther is he a more false relator of historyes then an vnkillfull interpreter of the holy Scriptures;M. Barlowes ignorance in interpreting the Scriptures. in which it is strange to see, how he tosseth the text, what sense he yieldeth, and what Commentaryes he maketh thereon, and that either by mistaking the meaning of the words, or by ridiculous application, or by forcing arguments from the same, which haue no dependance, no coherence, or agreement with the place he cyteth, yea not sticking

Canticles, and place where it is to be found. And is not this, trow you, a great commendation of the Spouse, that she ascendeth through the desert of this earth with al worldly delights of honor & wealth, which tickle the eyes, and blindes the sight of the wisest? What may not be proued by Scriptures, where such application is allowed? And here to make the best Commentary in M. Barlowes excuse, there is at least great mistaking of the true sense of the word dust, which I thinke in no other Author besides himself, is taken for worldly delights of honour, and wealth; as neyther in any Dictionary that euer I saw, is pigmentarius taken for a Merchant. But M. Barlow hath absolute authority to gayne-say both Grammar, Scriptures, and all manner of learning.
            18. As for ridiculous application, what more fond conceipt could he make, then to compare Gods diuine prouidence vnto Rammes-hornes: for thus speaking thereof, he saith: The prouidence of God in gouerning of his Church,
                  Barlow pag. 43. 
               is like the ruinating of the walls of Hierico by Rammes-hornes: it is powerfull, not violent; spirituall, but not visible; by meanes weake in shew, mighty in 
                     •
                  ffect.
               
                  Iosue 6. So he. And to omit the ridiculous interpretatiō, or rather inuersion of trumpets into Rammes-hornes, whereas they were of mettall, as S. Hierome, Origen, and others affirme, or made of horne, as some later writers, and so to be called rather Cornets, then Rammes-hornes, with which I thinke no man can soūd any blast: to omit this foolish error (I say) me thinkes M. Barlow in this Commentary is very forgetfull of himself; for in another place he maketh these powerfull, spirituall, and mighty Rammes-hornes to be very weake, poore, and feeble; for thus he speaketh

of his Maiestyes Apology with contempt to F. Persons: As if (saith he) the Apologers Answer like Hiericoes walls,
               
                  Pag. 201. 
               should presently fall with the blast of a Ramms-horne, and a few turnes about it:
               
                  Iosue. 6. and citeth the same place as before. So as now the force of the Ramms-hornes is very feeble: for the ruinating of the walls, by this reasō is more to be ascribed to their owne weakenes, then to any power of the Rammes-hornes. For in case they were so powerfull, spirituall, and mighty, the resemblance which here Syr William makes, should be very simple: for I thinke he will not say that the Apologers Answere is more powerfull then Gods prouidence, which before he compared to the Rammes-hornes. Or if he doe, I can say no more, but that for his labour he well deserueth to be put to the horne at Edenburrough.
            
            19. In another place going about to proue, that the Right which the Church hath against heretikes, eyther for their conuersion or chastisement, is Ius innatum, bred within it, & inseparable from it; how (thinke yow) doth he proue the same against F. P
                     •
                  rsons, who sayd, that is was Ius acquisitum? Very pithily yow may imagine: for thus he writeth.
                  Pag. 60. Gen. 3. 
               No sooner was there a Church designed, but this right was annexed, Semen mulieris conteret caput serpentis, as the enmity for contradiction, so the right for suppression is natiue. Thus M. Barlow, & no more. And is not this well proued, thinke yow? The seed of the woman shall bruze the serpents head; that is, Christ the Sonne of the Virgin shall ouercome the diue
                  •
               , ergo, it is Ius innatum, to punish heretikes. Me thinkes this argument proues M. Barlow more to be a Naturall, then any natiue right to be in the Church. For what is there here to signify

the Church, to signify heretikes, to signify this in-bred right? Truly I see no more coherence betweene the Scripture and the foresaid argument, then I see in this which followes;
                  Matth. 9. Our Sauiour cured a man of the palsy: ergo, M. Barlow is troubled with the gout. But let vs go on.
            20. Last of all, for adding to the holy text; what more euident example can be desired then that which he bringeth out of Deuteronomy,
               
                  Barlow pag. 334. to proue that bloudy artycle of the Kinges Supremacy in Ecclesiasticall causes? Bloudy I say, for that more effusion of bloud of Ecclesiasticall men hath bene made for that one point enacted by Parlament, then by all the lawes of former tymes, for the space of a thousand yeares togeather, which yet is not only by all Catholikes denyed, reiected by Caluin, and the Puritans; but vtterly condemned also by the Lutherans, and all learned Protestants. Against all which M. Barlow will needes proue by Scripture this vsurped authority, saying: God in his Word hath appointed Kinges to be Guardians of b
                     •
                  th the Tables, to commaund & prohibite, not in ciuill affaires only, but in matters also concerning religion saith S. Augustine: and citeth Deuteron. 17. & 18, verse. But in our bookes eyther Hebrew, Greeke, or Latin we fynd no such commission giuen to Kinges, nor any one syllable of their being Guardians of both Tables, or of any commaund in matters of Religion in this place, as elsewhere by the Author of the Supplement he is more fully and roundly tould. And so yow see, to what desperate attempts this Minister is driuen to defend a falsity.
            21. Touching the last point which remayned to be treated, of M. Barlowes ignorance in matters of

diuinity, for that it is his chief profession, I shall more inlarge my self therein,M. Barlowes ignorance in matters of Diuinity. & ioyne issue with him in one entire disputation, and that not the meanest, but rather the chiefest of his whole booke: for in no other that I know, doth he vse so many tearmes of art, or make so great vaūt or shew of learning, courage, & cō
               fidence, as in the same, to wit his discourse to proue a contradiction in Bellarmine concerning three Conclusions of his, about Iustification and confidence to be reposed in our good workes. But before I enter this combate, it will not be amisse to let the Reader see some part of his skill in another matter or two, that thereby he may take a scātling of the rest.
            22. First then he must know, that eyther M. Barlowes choice was so bad, or iudgement so small, that he neuer almost cyteth the Maister of Sentences, S. Thomas of Aquine, or other Schoolemen, but that he doth commonly very ignorantly mistake them, or maliciously bely them, or some way or other peruert them. For example he maketh S. Thomas to say,
                  Barlow pag. 188. D. Thom. 2.2. q. 104. ar. 6. ad. 3. That if an Vsurper or Intruder commaund thinges vnlawfull, yet in those thinges the subiects must notwithstanding obey, propter vitandum scandalum, aut periculum, and then addeth: Of this Diuinity Iudge not, ti's their owne. But I answere, t'is M. Barlowes lye, & not S. Thomas his Diuinity; who answering an argument, that the power of many Kinges is vsurped, and therefore they not to be obayed, saith: That a man is 
                     •
                  ound to obey, so far forth as the order of Iustice doth require, and therefore if they haue not lawfull principality, but vsurped, or commaund vniust thinges; the subiects are not bound to obey them, vnles perhaps per accidens, for auoyding of scandall or daunger. So S. Thomas: and here is

no mention of vnlawfull things commaunded, but of vniust, for a King may commaund things that are vniust; as that his subiects giue him all the money or goodes they haue; whereto for feare of daunger they may yield, which they could not doe, were the thing of it owne nature vnlawfull: which is S. Thomas his expresse doctrine in the next precedent article: neyther is there here (must notwithstanding obey) but the contrary, that absolutely they are not bound to obey, vnles perhaps it be for some other cause, as of scā
               dall or daunger: in which cases they may, to saue their liues, or for auoyding the hurt and offence of others, doe those thinges which are vniustly commaunded thē, so they be not of their owne nature vnlawfull, but only in respect of the Cōmaunder, who eyther cōtrary to iustice, or by vsurped authority doth cōmaund thē.
            23. Of this nature is that graue resolution of his taken, as he would haue it seeme, from S. Thomas his scholler Medina, That to full liberty, is required an vnlimited scope for the iudgement to deliberate.

                  7. Of which he shall heare more afterwards: for this vnlimited scope for the iudgmēt, is no other thing, thē the vnlimited ignorance of Syr William, which passeth all bound & measure. Againe where he citeth S. Thomas, touching actiue & passiue scandall,
                  pag. 57 which is refuted in this worke at large, and where he sayth very boldly, but ignorantly,
                  
                     
                        〈◊〉

                for S. Thomas maketh 4. sortes of pride, as any may see in the place cited in the margent, though in the place which

               M. Barlow citeth, I confesse there be not so many sorts specified: for in his 33. question and 5. article he mē
               tioneth none at all. So as M. Barlow roues at randome, and speaketh without booke, and thinkes all to be well, so he say somewhat, true, or false, and make a fond florish with the citing of schoolmen. Of this very stamp is his other of fatum, and prouidence,
                  pag. 246. in denying fatum to be prouidence, retorted vpon him by F. Persons in this Answere. And truly if M. Barlow be wise, he will, if he write againe, be more wary in dealing with Schoolmen, and alleadging their authorities, for that kind of learning far surpasseth the compasse of his shallow capacity.
            24. Another thing may be, to consider what strange Paradoxes he inserts here and there as positiōs dogmaticall, which who so listeth in practise to follow, shall either haue no religion or faith at all; or insteed of Christs Ghospell, the Turks Alcoran.
               M. Barlowes paradoxes. For exā
               ple, what more grosse and wicked assertion can there be, then to teach that Kings euen against our conscience are to be obeyed. For thus he replyeth against F. Persons saying,
                  Barlow pag. 160. 
               that Kings were to be obeyed; propter cōscientiā, sed non contra conscientiā. This (saith M. Barlow) is no sound doctrine in the negatiue part: for euen against a mans Conscience the Prince is to be obeyed. Againe: There is nothing more easy for proofe, or euident for d
                     •
                  monstration, then that obedience is to be enioyned,

                     •
                  n against conscience, if it be erroneous, and leaprous; and against religion if forged and falsely so called. And is not this a very learned Axiome? For more euident refutation whereof, let vs suppose that for which we powre forth our daily prayers to God, that his Maiesty were as all his Noble Progenetors of both Realmes

haue alwayes bene, a Catholick Prince, and as zealous for the truth therof as now he is for the Protestant cause, if then he should propose vnto Syr Williā
                the Oath of Supremacy of the Bishop of Rome, so cleerly out of Scriptures, and all antiquity, proued and euinced to be true, but yet in the blind eyes and leaprou
                     •
                   conscience of this Minister thought to be false; what would he doe therin? Will he sweare it to be true? But in his conscience he thinketh it to be false, and against the Scriptures. Will he refuse it? But Kings (saith he) euen against conscience are to be obeyed.
            
            25. Neyther doth he help the matter any thing at all by his distinction of leaprous and erroneous conscience,
               The Protestantes cōscience like a cheuerall point. for with men of his stamp, conscience is like a cheuerell point, which they may stretch & loose at their pleasure. For who knoweth not, that in the tyme of Q. Mary they were held to haue erroneous & leaprous consciences, euen by the iudgement of the greatest deuines in Geneua, who manteyned, that women were to be obeyed, albeit they were Queenes, euen in ciuill and temporall affaires? But within one yeare after, this errour and leaprosy was so transposed, that the quite contrary was taught, and they were not only held to haue leaprous and erroneous consciences who denyed ciuill obedience, but were condemned also as Traitours by Parlament, if they did deny Q. Elizabeth to be the Supreme head or Gouernesse of the Church of England. So that, it was not only lawfull, but necessary for her to haue all Temporall and Ecclesiasticall gouernmēt in her hands as she was Queen; which yet in Q. Mary to haue ciuill only, euen by reason of her sex, was iudged monstrous, vnnaturall and repugnāt to the Scriptures, and law of God. Many other examples

might be produced in this kind, to shew this new Gospell to be as constant as the weathercocke, which neuer turneth but when the wynd doth change, to wit, as often as occasions fall out that may fit their purpose: for then they will strayne all conscience and honesty also, to conforme themselues & become good subiects.
            26. Much like vnto this of obeying Kings against our conscience,A prophane and barbarous assertion of M. Barlow. is his other prophane and barbarous assertion of the Supremacy of the heathen Emperours, Nero, Domitian, and the rest ouer the Christian Church; yea which is more strange, that the auncient Fathers Iustinus Martyr, Irenaeus, Tertullian and others acknowledged the same. But you must know, that M. Barlow in cyting their words for proofe of this paradox is very silent,
                  Barlow pag 99. howsoeuer with all cōfidēce as a maxime in his new Deuinity vncōtrollable, he deliuereth the same, saying: That they acknowledged the Emperors Supremacy indepēdant vpon any but God. And a litle after, that Queene Elizabeth in her Supremacy was no vsurper by Nouell-claime, but accepted what God himselfe had annexed to her crowne. Out of which I first note, that by this Doctrine, the Great Turke is supreme Head of the Christian Church in Greece; and that if M. Barlow were there, for such he would acknowledge him. Secondly, the Pythagoricall manner of speaking which our Aduersaries vse in matters of greatest moment and controuersie. For whereas before King H

                  nry the eight, no Christian King euer tooke that title, or vsurped any such authority ouer the Church; yea for challenging much lesse, Constantius was called Antichrist both by S. Athanasius and S. Hilary:

                  •
                that the King is head of the Church, that he was so acknowledged by the ancient Fathers, that not only a woman may haue the same authority of Supremacy in all causes Ecclesiasticall; but that also the heathen Emperours had it as annexed to their Crowne, and Imperiall Dignitie, euen against the whole torrent of all writters, the practise of the Christian world, and euident text of Scripture it selfe; no Fathers, no history, no monument, no shew, or shaddow of proofe, or authority in former tymes being found for the same, without many straines, violent enforcements, or ridiculous illations made there-upon, as in the arguments of the Protestants, who haue treated this controuersie, is euery where to be seene.
            27. Lastly the Reader may note, that M. Barlow is so poore a Deuine, as eyther he knoweth not what belongeth to matters of faith, or els is so wicked, as against his owne knowledge, he will auouch that for true which is checked euen by his owne brethren, and conuinced by common sense and experiēce to be most false, to wit, that the Protestants and the Puritanes in England differ only in ma

               seeme a Deuine, writing in matters of such moment, and in defence of so great a Monarch, to dally withall, as it doth a Bishop to lead a morrice-daunce in his hose and dublet: This man, I say, answereth hereunto, that perhaps so the case stood then, when those Protestants did write, but that is well neere 20. yeares agoe, but now it is otherwise. Which is asmuch, as if he had said, that this new beliefe in England is not like the old, alwayes one, but is refined & altered with the tyme, and therefore no argument can be drawne from a thing done 20. yeares past, for that is to great antiquity for so new-fangled a fayth, which is alwaies in motion, and hath her waynes, changes, quarters, and full, like the Moone. But yet I must aske him further, how he will proue by any example of the Puritan

writers, this their change and submission to the Protestants, & conformity of doctrine with thē more now, then 20. yeares past? Are they not still in the same degree of difference and oppositiō as before? Doe they not still deny our Sauiours descent into hell? Do they not disclay me from the English Hierarchie? Will they acknowledge the Kings Supreme authority in causes Ecclesiasticall, as King Henry did challenge it? Or will they recall what they haue written of their discipline, that it is an essentiall marke of the Church, without which there were no Church, no Faith, no Ghospell, and consequently the Protestants to be no Ghospellers, to be out of the Church, out of the number of the faithfull?
            29. But for further confutation of both these Superintendents, and more cleere explication of the thing it selfe, besides what is afterwards said in this booke touching this point, it shall not be amisse here to set downe the words of a few Protestant and Puritan late, and yet liuing writers, what they iudge of ech other in this affayre, that our very enemyes may be iudges of the most shamefull assertion of these two Prelates, That the Protestants and Puritans differ in matters only cerimoniall, and agree in essentiall. And the reason that I produce no more in this kind, is for want of their bookes, which being not worth the sending so far, seldome come to our hands. I will begin with the Protestants.

                  isdiction: that all synnes be equall: that the Minister is of the essence of baptisme, with the like. And in the second dialogue he maketh in plaine tearmes this obiection, that there is no difference in matters fundamentall, but accidentall: and then answereth the same, that they do differ from the Protestants in some things that are fundamentall and substantiall, which he proueth by the article, of Christs descending into hell. And he might haue proued it further by the aboue rehearsed articles, for which Iouinian, Aerius, and others were reputed by the auncient Fathers, and condemned for Hereticks.
            31. VVith this Oliuer of Cambridge agreeth A. N. of Oxford in his Bible-bearer, towards the midest, for thus he writeth:
                  An. 1607. 
               They refuse to subscribe to the Kings lawfull authority in causes Ecclesiasticall, to the article of religion, to the booke of Common prayer, and the orders, rites, and cerimonies of our Church; nay they dissent from vs in things accidentall and cerimoniall. So he. By which last antithesis of accidentall & cerimoniall differences, it is most euident, that the former were essentiall & fundamentall. Neither doe I see, how this can be denyed by any: for if the Puritans refuse to subscribe to the articles of Protestant religion, who seeth not, that they approue it not, and consequently differ in

essentiall points, and that M. Barlow ouerlashed very much, when he wrote, that their vnkind quarrell with Puritans was in another kind, and not in matters of religion, wherein, forsooth, out of his great kindnes he will haue them to agree.
            32. And not to stand more for proofe hereof from Protestants, D. Couel cleereth the matter, when he saith:
                  D. Couell in his iust and temperate defence ar. 11. pag. 67. 
               But least any man should thinke, that our contentions were but in smaller points, and the difference not great; both sides haue charged the other with heresies (if not infidelities) nay euen such as quite ouerthrow the principall foundation of our Christian faith. Thus he. And this I thinke is another manner of matter then externall cerimonies, or accidentall differences: for if this be not a plaine iarre amongst Protestants and Puritans in Religion, I would faine know what M. Barlow will more require thereunto? but I see S. Gregories wordes verified in these men, where he saith:

               solent haeretici alia apertè dicere, alia occultè cogitare, the heretikes are wont to speake otherwise openly, then inwardly they thinke: for when they deale amongst themselues then are Protestants and Puritans heretikes and infidells to ech other: but when they answere vs, then all are friendes, all good Christians, all vnited in doctrine, & deuided only in cerimonies & accidentall differences.Puritans acknowledge an essentiall difference betweene them and the Protestants in matters of religion. This is another manner of equiuocation, then any of our schooles will allow, and only fit for such as are his schollers qui in veritate non stetit, sed mendax fuit ab initio.
            
            33. From Protestants I come to Puritans, who in this case are no lesse eager, playne, and resolute then the Protestants, but rather more; for this in expresse tearmes the Author of the Twelue generall arguments

                for that their Ecclesiastical iurisdiction is deriued from the King, else, say they, it is a flat deniall of his Supremacy, as there they shew. And in the next reason, which is the 4. and last, brought in for proofe of their assumption or minor, thus they conclude: There are no true and sober Christians but will say, that the Churches of Sco

               land France, the Low Countryes, and other places (that renounce such Archbishops and Bishops (as ours are) as Anti-christian and vsurping Prelates) are true Churches of God, which they could not be, if the authority & prerogatiues they claime to themselues were of Christ, and not vsurped: for if it were the ordinance of Christ Iesus, that in euery kingdome that receaueth the Ghospell, there should be one Archbishop ouer the whole kingdome, one Bishop ouer many hundred Pastors in a kingdome, and all they inuested with that authority and iurisdiction Apostolicall, which they clayme iure diuino to be due `vnto them, by the ordinance of Christ; certainly that Church which should renounce and disclayme such an authority ordayned in the Church, cannot be a true Church, but the Synagogue of Sathan: for they that should renounce, and deny such, must needs therin renounce, and deny Christ himself. Thus the assumption is cleared. So the Author.

Now what greater discredit can there be to the Protestants, and their cause, then then to rake Hell, and make Saints of these damned soules, enemies of all piety, most seditious and rebellious spirits?

Fox is not ashamed to draw into his den fanatical Almericke, making him, for more credit, of a Priest a Byshop. But M.

Truely as for the godlines of Waldo I find no great record, so neither will M. Iewell be able to shew wherin he disagreed from the Waldensians,

They contemned the Apostles Creed, and would haue Masse said but once in the yeare, to wit on Maunday-Thursday, by saying seauen Pater Nosters, and blessing the bread and wine &c. This and much more was the godly doctrine of M. Iewells Doctor Waldo, whose learning was equall to his vertue; for he could scant as most Authors affirme, either write or read. But I meane no further to prosecute this argument, of which who listeth to read more, may peruse what Coccius, the Author of the Protestants Apology, & F. Persons in the last part of his three Conuersions, haue written hereof, and he will rest satisfied. Now I come to examin M. Barlowes disputation, & what skill of Diuinity he sheweth in the same.

Persons standeth ouer the Cardinall, as if he were gasping for breath, vnder the blow he hath receaued for his contradictions, and makes the Father as a Chirurgion of the camp to cure three or foure of them: which M. Barlow will needs lance againe, and cut as he thinketh to the quick; but vseth such dull instruments & that so weakely, as he doth neither cut, nor bruze, though much he labour to do his best, and after some ten pages spent in idle babling, lying, and ignorant disputing, like a victorious conquerour in the end excusing himself for the length of his discourse, by reason that F. Persons did set vp (saith he) his crest, and rest vpon it, that if in this, there be any contradiction, he will yield that the Apologer hath not ouerlashed in the other,
               
                  pag. 266. he concludeth triumphantly, saying: Let the vnpartiall tryall be the seuere iudge either way. Which I also desire, and withall aduertise the Reader, that in some things I am the shorter where much aduantage is giuen, for that the same is afterwards by F. Persons himself handled in due place in the ensuing discussion.

            46. Well then, this vncertainty being of the

person, what saith he thereunto? In this he is somewhat briefe, but very confident, and concludeth thus:A strange inference. 
               If it be of the person, then merit is cut of. And why good Sir? For merit (saith he) raiseth a confidence, but where there is no comfort there can be no cōfidence,
               
                  Ibid.
                
               & in vncertainty there is no comfort; for relyance on that whereof a man doubts, causeth rath
                     •
                  r a feare to be deceaued, then a confidence to be releiued. So he. Which argument supposeth as graunted, that our meritorious workes breed confidence, which we deny not, if he meane of that confidence towards God before mentioned: & then it rūneth in this forme: Where there is no comfort there is no confidence: but in vncertainty there is no comfort, ergo, no confidence: and so consequently no merit. That the force of this syllogisme may the better appeare, I shall apply it to another matter thus: Where there is no comfort, there is no confidence: but when our Sauiour prayed in the garden, & sayd, tristis est anima mea vs

But this is the diuinity of Syr William.
            
            47. Againe, there is great equiuocation in the word vncertainty, which M. Barlow taketh in the most generall and absolute signification, as excluding all manner of certainty and knowledg whatsoeuer; when as in Bellarmyne it is taken far otherwise:
                  lib. 3. de Iustif. ap. 2. for in the second Chapter of his third booke, hauing distinguished two sorts of certaintyes, the one euident, the other obscure.

Of this later he maketh three degrees: the first is of the certainty of faith,Three degrees of certaynty in Bellarmyne. 
               cui nulla ratione potest subesse falsum; the second of such things as are belieued for humane authority, but so common as it excludeth all feare though not all falsity: for that all men may be false, and either deceaue, or be in such things deceaued. Of this sort, he puteth for examples, that Cicero and Virgil were famous men, that Augustus Caesar was Emperour, that Alexandria is in Egypt, Constantinople in Thrace, Hierusalem in Palestine, Antioch in Asia; and then declareth the last degree in this manner: Tertium gradum habent illa quae tot signis & coniecturis nituntur, vt securum hominem reddant, & anxietatem excludant, non tamen formidinem omnem expellant: a
                     •

                   fidei. That is: these things haue the last degree of certainty, which are grounded on so many signes and coniectures, that they make a man secure, & exclude all anxiety, though they expell not all feare: and this is called coniecturall certainty, & it is rather to be termed the certainty of opinion, then the certainty of faith. So B

Status

                Plainly declaring of what certainty he speaketh, to wit of that, which of all others is the greatest, and most infallible.
            48. Which being supposed, let vs examine how well to the purpose M. Barlow talketh of vncertainty when he sayth, but in vncertainty there is no comfort. Where if he take the word vncertainty, as it excludeth all certainty, it is true; but then he abuseth the Reader, for B
                     •
                  llarmyne taketh it not so, but supposeth & proueth the contrary: if he take it as it is a deniall only of the certainty of faith, then it is most false; for it may haue other certainty sufficient to yield comfort, though it haue not this, yea confidence as it is hope cannot possibly stand with that absolute certainty.
               Hope cā
                  not stand with the absolute certainty of faith. For who can be said to hope for that which he is certayn to haue? Or were it not a ridiculous manner of speach to say, that the soules of the Saints in heauen hope for the resurrectiō of their bodyes, which infallibly they know shal be restored, & reunited againe vnto thē? Or that we hope that God will iudge both the wicked & iust, punishing the first with endles torments, and rewarding the other with euerlasting felicity? Well may the Saints be sayd to expect their bodyes, and we the iudgment, but neyther the one, nor the other by reason of their vndoubted certainty can be hoped for, as is euident.
            49. And whereas M. Barlow saith, that relianc

                  nce to be relieued, is far from the

purpose, & a new changing of the terme. For who saith, that a man doubteth of his iustice or righteousnes? Bellarmyme expresly denyeth it, and saith, that the morall certainty that a man hath of his merits or iustification, is so great,

               that although it take not away all feare; yet doth it exclude all anxiety, and wauering, yea doubting also, if he may be sayd to doubt, who assenteth to neyther part. So he. Which may be made more cleere by the example of S. Paul, debet in spe qui arat, arare, he that tilleth the ground, must till it in hope,1. Cor. 9
                     •
                  
                that is, hope that the ground tilled, will bring forth fruit;Morall certainty sufficient to yield comfort. and he who thus hopeth is neyther certayn that he shall reape the fruite, for then he would not hope the same, & it may so fall out, as that he may reape none at all: neyther yet is he doubtfull whether he shall, or shall not, for he hopeth that he shall, and for that he hath many reasons, and so assenteth to the affirmitiue part, or els he would neuer haue sowen: as likewise doth the sayler on the seas, for if he were as doubtfull of drowning, as ariuing vnto the port he sayleth to, he would neuer I thinke aduenture to passe them ouer. And whether this morall certainty which both sowers and saylers haue, be not sufficient to yield them rather confidence to be relieued, then a feare to be deceaued, needeth no other proofe then the common practice & custome, which in the one, and in the other we daily behold. From this argument M. Barlow with like good fortune proceedeth to another thus:
            50. This also (saith he) crosseth the very next precedent proposition,
               
                  Ibid.
                
               that some confidence may be reposed in our owne righteousnes and good workes, if men be assured that they be good workes. But by this proposition in hand, it seemes none can be assured. If they may, why doth he

                  oards little vse and lesse comfort; and in that regard is directly opposite to this last, which is full of confidence and consolation. Hitherto M. Barlow, fighting like a blind man with his face turned from his aduersary, and then florishing in the ayre, where all his dry blowes do but beat against the wynd, and touch not B

                  •
                whose words had he seene and vnderstood, he would neuer I thinke haue framed this idle conceipt. For what contradiction is there, I pray you betweene these two propositions: some confidence may be reposed in our good workes, so that by morall coniecturall certainty we know them to be such, and this other, for that if we speake of the certaynty of faith, which can be subiect to no falsity, we are vncertain whether our workes be meritorious or not; and therefore in respect thereof as also to auoyd pride, is is best to repose all our confidence in the mercy and bountifulnes of Almighty God. Truly no more, then is in this other, They that thinke themselues morally assured of M. Barlows fidelity, may repose some confidence in him: but because this their assurance is not so great, but that they may be deceaued, as he deceaued his maister the Earle of Ess
                     •
                  x, who reposed so much confidence in him, by proclayming out of the pulpit at Paules Crosse those things which the other before his death, for the quieting of his conscience had disclosed vnto him in secret, therefore it is best to let him alone, and trust to Almighty God, of whose fidelity no man can haue any cause to feare,

or doubt.
            51. By which is easily answered the foresaid argument, the force whereof resteth vpon these contradictory termes, that,M. Barlow altereth Bellarmines wordes the better to impugne them. 
               a man may be assured of his good workes, and, none can be assured of their good workes: but neyther the one, nor the other is in this place of Bellarmine. For he saith not, that a man may be assured, but, that if he be assured: and in the second, for the vncertainty of our righteousnes, and not, none can be assured of their righteousnes: for so it were a contradiction, if the word ass
                     •
                  red were taken in the selfe same sense & signification in both places. But as the words lye in B
                     •
                  llarm. albeit he should speak of the same certainty in both places (as he doth not;) yet were it not any contradiction at all, for both partes are true: the first, that men may repo
                  •
               e confidence in their good workes, if with the certainty of faith (as they may doe by diuine reuelation) they know them to be such
                  •
                the second thus, for the vncertainty of our righteousnes (for without reuelation we cannot be sure therof) it is best to repose all our confidence in the mercy of Almighty God. Wherein here standeth the contradiction? And M. Barlow sheweth great ignorance in this matter, when he saith that, by this proposition of Bellarmine, it s
                     •
                  emeth that none can be assured: if they may, why doth he call it incertitudinem iustitiae nostrae, the vncertainty of our righteousnes? This, I say, is very simple stuffe: for doth not this Prelate preach

                as presently we shall see. Againe where he saith that confidence may be extended or remitted, there is an implicancy in the termes, if we speake in the phrase of schoolmen: for only quantity can be extended and only quality remitted: and to ioyne them both togeather, is (to vse M.

but how contrite M. Barlowes hart is, or whether it be deuided or vnited, I know not; sure I am, that here is double dealing, much ignorance, and nothing with any learning or sincerity handled.

Barlowes potent word

Lo here a short conquest: one word ALONE cassiering from confidence all merits, all Saints, all Angells, and whatsoeuer els, and from M. Barlow himself all learning, all sincerity, all truth, all honesty: this doubtles is a potent word that containeth so great vertue in it. But let vs examine the force of this inference. First I would demaūd of M. Barlow what Saints & Angells haue to doe with the confidence that riseth out of our good wo

               kes, that by this word Alone, they should be abandoned & cassierd? Did euer any affirme, that this confidence of our merits did depend on them, as vpon the obiect of the same? This is one notorious foolery.
            56. Againe, where will he find in all Bellarmyne that solamisericordia, only mercy, is the entire obiect of our confidence? Doth he no

               itorious, and that we auoid pride? He saith in deed, that the securest way is to repose all our confidence in the only mercy of God, but not, that the mercy of God is the only obiect. And M. Barlow whiles he thinketh to put his aduersary to silence, as Christ did the Deuill with the word Only,
               M. Barlow makes onely in the word Only. himselfe is ouercome with temptation of one lye at the least, if he knew what he wrote, or of ignorāce if he knew it not. Moreouer where he addeth, that had the Cardinall said in the first place, mans confidence must, or may be reposed in his owne m

                  rits, & afterwards had subioyned, mans confidēce must, or m

               iue; he both dealeth falsly, and refuteth himselfe: falsly, in foysting in the word must in both propositions, which is not in Bellarmyne, and it cleane altereth the sense: for it is not all one to say, one may doe such a thing, and a man must doe it: for example, it is a far different thing to say, that M. Barlow may giue the reuenews of his Bishoprick of one whole yeare, if he will, to the poor people of Lincolne, and M. Barlow must giue his renenews of one yeare to the said poore people. But without this cobling and cogging in of words M. Barlow can make no contradi

               tiō. He refuteth also himself for omitting the word must, here thrust in as I said. Bellarmin

Barlows confession are not contradictory, and therfore all his preaching and pratling, as F. Parsons well calleth it, se

            57. After this sory stuffe he beginneth a Sermō out of S. Augustine vpon these words of the Psalme,
                  Barl. pa. 261. 
               Memorabor iustitiae tuae solius: saying, that the said Father doth insist vpon the same, both with an admiration,
               
                  Ps. 70. ô solius, and also with a question, rogo vos, I pray you: why should he ad this word solius? Had it not bene inough for him to say,
               S. Augustine misunderstood. 
               I will remember thy righteousnes? No, but solius prorsus, it alone, altogeather I will remember: why so? Vbi meam non cogito, for in so saying I put out of my mynd any righteousnes which is mine owne. So M. Barlow: and hauing ended his deuotion, he concludeth thus: So then totum, whole confidence, that taks away the particular aliqua, in his former proposition, sola excludes meritum in both propositions. This is all he hath touching the obiect, and all wyde of the marke, as is most euident.
            58. Yea so far is S. Augustine from checking this assertion of the Cardinall, as he elswere graunteth the same, saying: vt speret regnum, habeat bonam conscientiam, credat, & operetur,
               
                  Aug. in prafat. ad Psal. 31. that a man may hope for the kingdome of heauen, let him haue a good conscience, let him belieue and labour. So he: and the place here cyted by M. Barlow hath no more coherence with this matter now in controuersy, then a poke full of plums, with the way to London. For our question is of such workes, as be meritorious, and follow, or rather flow from Gods grace inherent within vs. But S. Augustine speaketh of that grace which goeth before all our good workes, and of that iustification which the deuines call the first iustificatiō, by which a sinner is made iust and first called vnto God from that state, and saith, that this grace or righteousnes

no workes can merit, which all Catholiks admit, & the Cardinall elswhere at large doth proue:

                   4. & 5. and that he meaneth the first, not the second iustification, is cleare by his owne words following in this explication, which are these: I am enim si superbi desideramus, v

               For now if we that are proud doe desire, or wearied do returne, we cannot returne but by grace:
grace is freely giuen, for if it were not a free gift, it were not grace. Moreouer if therfore it be grace, because it is freely giuen, nothing of thine went before for which thou must receaue it. For if any of thy good workes went before, thou hast receaued a reward, no free gift; the reward due vnto thee is punishment: that therefore we are deliuered, comes not frō our merits, but is of his grace; him therfore let vs praise to whome we owe all that we are, to whome we owe our saluation, with which the Prophet concluded, after he had said many things, saying: memorabor iustitiae tuae solius, I will remember thy righteousnes alone. So S. Augustine. So cleerly explicating himself, & euincing M. Barlows ignorance, as that I shall not need to ad any further Commentary for confutation of the same.
The rest which he addeth by way of antithesis totum, aliqua, sola, meritum, is nothing els but meere foolery, as shalbe afterwards shewed.

               Euery Bishop of Rome is vnder Christ the immeatate and sole chief Pastour of the whole Church in the Christian world, this, saith our Philosopher, may be contradicted two wayes: first expresly, Some Bishop o

                  •
                is a contradictory with the negatiue. Secondly it may be crossed by implicatiō, as thus: The patriarch of Constantinople is vnder Christ the immediate and sole chief p

               he L. of Yorke is Primate of all the North part, is with me no contradiction: for that I hold both propositions to be false, and neyther of them both to haue any Primacy at all in that Church: and as the later will not claime it, so M. Abbots may be sure, I will not assigne it vnto him, whome I doe as much hold to be Abbot of W

                  ury. And the like must M. Barlow needs say of his two propositions, for that neyther of them in his iudgmēt

               s true, and therefore are more contrary then contradictory; as are also these, omnis homo currit, nullus homo currit, and the like.
            61. Wherefore if it be (as M. Barlow will needs haue it) our very case in hand, euen by the verdict of all skilfull Philosophers in the world, the Cardinall will be quit at least from a contradiction: and it is but childish babling, yet very frequent in M. Barlow, to make the oppositiōs of the termes thēselues, saying, that h

                and Yorke to Canterbury, then proue any contradictiō to be in the same. But let vs draw to an end of M. Barlows dispute.
            62. I passe ouer the rest he addeth, concerning this matter, although his chiefest fraud and cosenage be conteyned in the same.M. Barlowes bad dealing. For of an exhortatiue proposition in the Cardinall, he maketh an absolute and necessary, by cogging in the words is, & must, thus: mans confidence is to be reposed in the alone mercy of God, and, some confidence of man must be placed in his owne merits, which are his owne forgeryes, and not the Cardinalls assertions: and then further in falsly charging F. Persons, as though he said that good workes increase confidence in their owne nature,
                  pag. 263. and therfore will needs haue his doctrine to be condemned by Pius V. amongst other like assertions of a Louain Doctor; but all is forgery: for the Father speaketh not of our workes, as alone they proceed from vs, but as they proceed also from Gods grace within vs, and for that cause calleth them the good workes of a Christiā: & it is vnchristian dealing in this Prelate to say, that this proposition was euer condemned by Pius V. or any other Pope or Councell, who only speake of our workes as they are done by a Pagan, without grace, or any other supernaturall help; and last of all for maliciously transposing the word any, to make it signifie that which the Father neuer dreamed of, thereby to make him contrary to B
                     •
                  llarmine, and contradictory to himself. For he maketh him to say, that a man may place any confidence in his owne merits, so he beware of prid
                     •
                  , which is a notorious vntruth. But I will not, as I said, further stand to refell these falshoodes, for that the Father himself

hath very learnedly performed the same, and M. Barlow will neuer be able with any shew of truth o
                  •
                learning to make any reply therunto.
            63. And whereas for the last vpshot of this his dispute, he marshalleth forth in one rank togeather, a heape of contradictory speaches, giuing vs for a parting blow to make all sure a knocking Lye; I shal with the same conclusion end also this matter, not entring into any other confutation thereof, then the bare rehearsall or skoring vp the vntruthes, which he hath couched togeather in this one number or paragraph, excepting only the last, in which I shallbe forced to be a little more large.
            64. First then he would faine make the Cardinall & F. Persons to disagree,A cluster of M. Barlowes lies. by setting downe their contrary positions, and thē the Cardinall to fight with himself: the first part he proueth thus: Our owne good workes haue such an vncertainty in them, as that our whole confidence must be referred to Gods mercy saith the Cardinall:
               
                  Barlow pag. 264. 265. 
               Our good workes in their owne nature are such as that they may giue hope and confidence of themselues, saith his Champion. So he. And here at the least are three lyes, if not more: for Bellarmine saith not, that our workes haue such an vncertainty in them, as no confidence can be reposed in them; nether doth he say, that all our confidence must be referred vnto Gods mercy: neither doth F. Persons affirme, that our good workes IN THEIR OWNE NATVRE may giue hope and confidence of themselues, for they require Gods grace and promise of reward to make them meritorious, and to yield confidence. M. Barlow goeth on. Mans WHOLE confidence is to be placed in the mercy of God alone, saith Bellarmine: A man may willingly

repose ANY confidence in his owne workes, saith F
                     •
                   Pers
                     •
                  n. Both are grosse lyes in M. Barlow. For these two proposi

               ions are neither found in Bellarmyne, nor F. P

                  rsons, but forged by himselfe, & are both most false.
            65. And truly, no meruaile though M. Barlow be very resolute in his refuting our opinions, when as he frameth an aduersary in the ayre, whom he may conquer; & then telle
                  •

               stery, but misery rather, both to the man and his cause. For hauing in this place in foure propositions told vs fiue lyes, thus he vaunteth ouer vs, saying: Betweene them both, they haue broached a goodly doctrine, and v

                  idence towards God, and yet a man is vncertayne, whether they be good or no. The first part I haue shewed to be false, if by their owne nature he vnderstand them, as done without Gods grace inherent in th

                doer. The second is true, if M. Barlow vnderstood it: for the word vncertaine excludeth not all certainty, as before I noted, but the certainty of faith. Secondly (he saith) man must be acertayned that the workes he

               or els he may not trust in them, and yet no man can assure himself that they are so, vnles he haue a reuelation, saith the Cardinall, then which wh

                  t is more VNCERTAIN? saepe fallax, semper incerta, are his owne words. So M. Barlow.
            66. How men may be acertayned of their good

workes, hath bene already declared, and how we may be acertayned of your truth and fidelity,How we

The Cardinall sheweth, that without reuelation, we cannot haue absolute certaynty of our being in grace, or perseuerance in the same vnto the end, because this certainty being the certainty of faith, dependeth vpon Gods diuine reuelation, as her formall obiect, which is made cleer by the connexion of the present and future tymes in the Cardinall. For who but God can reueale to a man what shall be his end, eyther for blisse or woe? Annunciate quae ventura sunt in futurum, & sci

            67. But least he should seeme to impute this

Atheisticall paradox of the vncertainty of Gods diuine reuelation to Bellarmine, without all proofe, he cyteth in the margent for his Readers direction lib. 1. de Verbo Dei cap. 2. where if he repayre to examine this matter, I assure him, he shall not find one word therof, but of the fanaticall opinion of the Swenkfeldians, who reiecting all written authority, as well Scriptures, as Fathers, would haue euery man to be directed by their owne inward spirits, which Bellarmine saith, is often deceiptfull, alwayes vncertayne. For thus he writeth: Quare cùm sacra Scriptura regula credendi certissima, tutissima

By which wordes he plainly sheweth, that he is so far from speaking of Gods diuine reuelation, as the wicked spirit of these hereticks is different from the spirit of Christ, to wit, as cleane opposite as Hell to Heauen, truth to falshood, darknes to light. And with what face or forhead the

               pirit into Gods reuelatiō? Yea, with what conscience can he say, that this reuelation may be an illusion? As some superstitious people (saith he) take that fire for a walking spirit which is but ignis fatuus,M. Barlows melancholy conceipt. an illuding meteor; so Pharisaycall, and melancholick conceipts may thinke them to be infusions of the holy Ghost which are but speculatiue imaginations of their owne Ghost. Thus M. Barlow very profoundly,

as you see, or rather most profanely, comparing God
                  •
                reuelation (for of that Bellarmine speaketh) which is alwayes certayne and certainly knowne of him to whome it is made, to his walking spirit, or ignis fatuus, to Pharisaycall and melancholick conceipts; as though the truth of the said reuelation depended on the disposition of the receauer, and not wholy vpon the infallible authority of Almighty God, who reuealeth the same. I will not say that M. Barlow is either Pharisaycall or melancholick, but that he is fatuus, or else fanaticus; albeit I say it not, yet the thing it self will speake, if his malice were not greater then his folly in this point, which I meane not to discusse.
            68. After all these vntruthes and manifold ignorances, he concludeth his disputation with a Sermon, and is become very deuout vpon the suddaine, and of a tender conscience, telling vs,M. Barlows suddain pang of deuotion. that it is better for the Cardinall to acknowledge an ouersight in a long discourse, then to ouerthrow one soule redeemed by Christs bloud: Contradictions in assertions wounds but one opposite member; but vnsoundnes in doctrine, concerning saluation, doth wound the weake conscience of a Christian.

For so did also our late woodden Embassadour at Venice, who against the Iesuits and their doctrine in this point, would be often very free, & as himself thought very ingenious also, but more free in this art of Lying. For being at Auspurge, & requested to write some motto, or sentence, with the subscription of his name thereunto, was not ashamed to professe it to be the chiefest point of his office, writing the definition of an Embassadour thus:
                  Vide Serarium in logis Apologet. par. 3. cap. 20. §. 16. in fine.

Iohn Fleckhamer for a perpetuall pledge of friendship, Henry Wotton the first Embassadour of the most Soueraigne King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland to the Venetians.

               in steed of essētiall & specificall. 
               kindly parts, to with a good man that can lye well. And whether in the last tumults of Venice betwixt the Sea Apostolick and that Cōmon-wealth he discharged

not throughly this part of his charge, and that very essentially & kindly also, I refer me to them who receaued his letters, and know what he wrote. Surely M. Barlow in this booke is so copious therein, that if other of his owne ranke in our Countrey, were to be defined by him,The definition of an English Bishop taken from the Idaea of M. Barlow. a Protestant English Bishop should be nothing els, but an ignorant Superintendent that can lye, raile, & flatter notoriously. Of his ignorance we haue already seene some proofe, now let vs see how well he can lye.
            72. In the twelueth page he telleth the Reader, that F. Persons hauing wished the destruction of the Kings Maiesty by the gunpowder-plot,
               
                  pag. 12. A malitious fictiō against F. Persons 
               and by hope deuoured the same, he came on his iourney a good step (as some report) towards England, that he might haue song Te Deum in his natiue Countrey, for the good successe of that happy exployt. And this againe he repeats in the 217. page, saying: As if there were no difference between him that should say,
               
                  pag. 217. F. Persons was almost vpon the Sea coast of England, expecting the issue of the powder-plot, and his, that should auer, that he was vpon the sea coast, and shipt for England. So he.
            73. This vntruth both for the iniury done to F. Persons, & for the improbability of the thing it self, which hath not so much as any shaddow of truth, deserueth the first place; all Rome knowing the contrary to be most true, that for the yeare before and after the powder-plot, the said Father was alwayes in the Citty, or in the places neere adioyning: and at this very tyme whē M. Barlow would haue him to be on the sea coast he was sick in bed, in which as his weakenes would permit either himselfe to write, or to dictate to another, he refuted the fifth part of Syr Edward Cookes Reports,
               
which refutation is vnanswered as yet by him, and not answerable by any. Neyther can M. Barlow plead ignorance in this case, seeing that in the arraignment of F. Garnet, where there was so much forcing and streyning of things to the vttermost, as well against the said F. Persons in particuler, as the whole Order in generall, there was no mention made heerof, nor yet in the printed bookes both English and Latyn, which since haue been set forth of that matter.
            74. VVas the thing so small, trow you, as that it deserued not a remembrance at least in that action in which far lesse presumptions then this were so tragically exaggerated? Or could there haue byn imagined a more forcible proofe, or more direct meanes for the discrediting that Order, then to haue conuinced, by this iourney, the only Superiour of all the English mission, to haue knowne and approued the same? No M. Barlow, had this happened, all you Ministers (genus irritabile vatum) had sounded it out with full mouth, all pulpits, all bookes had proclaimed it, all Princes Courts, yea all cornes of Christendome had been cloyed with Embassages, pamphlets, Inuectiues, and clamors against him: and therefore to set downe this fiction in print, well sheweth how far your malice ouerwent your wit,
                  Barlow pag. 360. howsoeuer you temper the first place with this parenthesis (as some report) for you could not but know that they reported a lie; as you doe againe with exceeding impudent malice, when you write, but proue it not, that F Persons had his hart, hand and head in the powder-plot.

So he: printing only the word bely in ordinary letters, as though all the rest had byn the words of the Father. But without any belying M. Barlow, I must tell him, that here are three lyes in two lynes: for neyther doth F. Persons call Catholiks Traitors, whome in most of his bookes he hath defended and cleared from that false imputation; neyther doth he say, that he must reuyle Queene Elizabeth, neyther that he will doe it the rather, for that she is a woman: and yet M. Barlow presently replyeth, saying: If F. Persons haue no other comfort th
                     •
                  n to cheer them vp, because a woman quelled their insolency; then may the diuell be comforted &c. What 
                  •
               ill you say to this man? F. Persons saith, that Q. Elizabeth was the first woman christian, or created, that tooke vpon her supreme power in spirituall or Ecclesiasticall matters, and M. Barlow cannot refell the same, nor doth he go about it: but from his owne chayr of Oracles, tels vs, without further proofe, that she was no vsurper by nouell-clayme, and that God had annexed it to her crowne; and insteed of prouing this, entreth into the commendation of women, as if F. Persons had discommended them: but the truth is, he saw, that thereby he had more matter for talke, and authority for proofe, then in the barren subiect of the feminine Supremacy, of which before Q. Elizabeth no example can be shewed, and therfore he accommodated

               F. Persons text to serue to his purpose in that behalfe.

not bene preuented by sinister information, in F. Persons goe before the other, as due vnto them, and are there so plainly explicated, as none but some malicious Minister could be ignorant of his meaning.
            79. Yet after all this cutting off, transposition, inuersion, & changing in so short a sentence, to take it as it pleaseth M. Barlow to giue it, how will the conclusion drawne therof, agree with the premisses, Catholicks had receaued at his Maiesties hands greater fauours as due vnto them, if he had not bene preuented by sinister information? How, I say, will it follow, that by sinister informatiō

haue perswaded themselues they were iust, and therfore as a Generall in the field pursued them as open enemies, or as a Iudge vpon the Bench commaunded execution to be done vpon them, as MALEFACTORS. And hauing set downe these wordes, as if F. Persons had spoken them, be beginneth to reply against them with this insulting entrance. But first who girt the sword to the Popes side? But I may better retort this interrogation vpon M. Barlow, and aske him; But first, who taught him to ly so loud? For in all the 28. nūber which he calles a pretty passage, where will he find these wordes; And therefore as a Generall in the field pursued them as open enemies, or as a Iudge vpon the bench cōmaunded execution to be done vpon them, as MALEFACTORS? And if these Wordes be neither there, nor in any other place of F. Persons, is not this a pretty passage, or rather a paltry cosenage, and lying liberty in this Minister, to make his aduersary to speake what himselfe listeth, and especially in such an odious manner and matter, as here he doth, printing the words MALEFACTORS, in great capitall letters, as though F. Persōs had said, that Popes may cōmaund execution to be done vpon Princes, as vpō MALEFACTORS, which is nothing els but the capital lying of M. Barlow?

               There needs no more (CVRR) then that: writing the word CVRR, in great capitall letters, for else the Reader should not haue discouered him so well to be a great capitall foole. Moreouer

he calleth him turpissima bestia, a practised Equiuocatour, an equiuocating Malepardus. From beasts and doggs, he cometh to the Diuell, and compareth the Father to him, as he is Diabolus, as he is Satan,

Barlow. as an idle fancy or fiction rather of this foolish Parasite, two things I would demaūd of him: the first that seeing he will needs draw his glorious Queen into the Calendar of Saints, what title or place she shall haue amongst them in the same, for that in ours there is no Saint of that sex, but is either Virgin, or Martyr, or both, or else nec Virgo, nec Martyr, as are Wiues, Widdowes, and repentāt sinners. M. Barlow shall do well in his next to tell vs, in which of these degrees this his new Sainted Queen Elizabeth is to be placed:Q. Elizabeth nec virgo nec martyr.
                perhaps when he hath thought better on the matter, he may find some perplexity, & be content to let her passe for one that was nec Virgo, nec Martyr, and thrice happy had it bene for her, if she had bene indeed a true repentant sinner.

Elizabeth, he must needs condemne to hell-fire, for it is impossible that one heauen should hold both these Queenes, in life and beliefe so quite opposite, the one, with great commendation of vertue, remayning in the vnity of the Catholick faith, in which, and for which she dyed, to the great admiration

Barlowes purpose: for none can deny it, to be a great glory to this vnworthy Minister, to be ioyned with royall Monarches the Lords annointed and amounted. But in the Author, I meane S. Hierome himselfe, there is no mention of any such Minister, or Monarch; there is no annointing, no amounting; for he only speaketh of the B. Virgin, and Mother of our Sauiour, saying, or rather concluding his whole dispute with this sentence. Caninam facundiam seruus Domini pariter experiatur & mater: I shall with cōfort endure his rayling, who togeather with me reuiles the Mother of our Lord. So he. which full little concerneth this Minister, who with his Mates rather ioine with Heluidius to dispraise her, then with S. Hierom & the Cath. Church to defend or commend her, as all the world doth see.

            127. And none can deny but that here he hath shewed himselfe, both a feruent and furious defender of his Maiesty,M. Barlows rage ouerrunneth his wit. for his rage doth ouer-runn his witt, & his words all modesty. But not to stand vpon his immodesty, which is a quality inseparable from the subiect, I would aske him in Christian charity, why he hath put downe these as the words of F. Persons, or where they are to be found in his booke? Doth he euer say

                that his Maiesty offered ABVSE? or doth he vse the tearmes of vndeuinelike doctrine? what malice, what forgery, or rather what villany is this, to make F. Persons directly to charge his Maiesty, as in his own words with offering abuse, who in his booke hath no one such word or sillable? All that he hath, is against him, whom he tooke to be the author of the Apology,

whom for the reasons he alleaged in the very begining of his letter, & for other respects he could not perswad himself to be his Maiesty, as all know who then liued and conuersed with him, and heard him seriously giue his iudgment thereof. The true words of F. Persons which M. Barlow should haue cyted are these:

               Heare now, what abuse is offered to the words and meaning of the Breue, euery simple Reader will see without any explycation from me. For that the Pope doth not prohibite naturall obedience in things lawfull; nor doth say, that such naturall, or ciuill obedience is opposite to faith or saluation of soules; nor that the oath is vnlawfull, for exhibiting such naturall or ciuill obedience: but for that, besides this exaction of naturall obedience, which is lawfull, it conteyneth diuers other points also, concerning matters of Catholicke religion &c. Let the Reader compare them, with those which in the Fathers name M. Barlow hath giuen vs, & he shal soone see how well, whē he is disposed to rayle, he can forge a text to befit his argumēt, & what cōscience he maketh to abuse his Reader, or slaunder his Aduersary.

            129. I will end with one place more wherewith the forgery is ioyned also incredible impudency, as the Author of the Supplement doth more fully handle and cleerly euince against him. Yow haue before heard M. Barlows bould assertion, touching vnity of names about a place obiected out of S. Leo, saying, that S. Peter was assumpted in cōsortium indiuiduae vnitatis, which F.

of which I haue laied forth some examples, but haue left many more then I haue taken, and in some of the heads touched more aduantagions also for the cause it self, then those which I haue alleadged, as who so listeth with any diligence to confer M.

For not knowing which way to turne themselues to answere, they thinke it no ill policy to make the Reader belieue, that they are of no worth, the authors

contemptible, their proofes none at all. This M. Barlow doth often; & M. Andrews also maketh his first entrance with the same to his last booke.

                So likewise before them did M. Whitaker against the Rhemes Testament, and M. Iewell against Doctor Harding, which shamefull shift, they neuer vse so much, as when they know least what else to reply. For proofe whereof, if there were no other argument, let their owne writing against vs be seen, especially this answer of M. Barlow, in which his charges are fierce & frequent; but when tryall is to be made, he falleth eyther to forging of texts, or corrupting of Authors, or idle & ignorant babling, or to worse dealing as hath bene shewed. On the contrary side, we for cleerer euidence and vpright dealing, charge him with no more then we do proue; nor take any other proofe, then what is deduced from his owne words, or else plainly expressed by them; & that without any mutation, addition, chopping, or any māner of wresting them to another sense & meaning, then they of their owne nature do beare, & M.

                surely I must tell him that he is much mistaken, for so much as of Cardinall Bellarmins being Cardinall there can be no doubt, seeing he was made by the Pope, who only can, & euer yet hath made Cardinalls, such as now we speake of. But of M. Iewells being Byshop we haue not so much certainty, yea we haue no certainty at all. For who I pray you made him? Who gaue him his Iurisdiction? Who imposed hands vpon him? What orders had they? What Byshops were they?

            137. This was the first ordering of M. Iewell & the rest, as I haue bene enformed by one that heard it from M. Neale Reader of the Hebrw lecture in Oxford,
               The like also affirmeth Sacrobosco in the place cited. who was there present, & an eye witnes of what was done and passed. Perhaps for a further complemēt to supply all defects in the matter or forme of this ordering, Q. Elizabeth as Head of the Church, did as a noble Woman is said to haue done neere Vienna, of whom Schererius the Lutheran writeth:

A few yeares since, not farr from hence, a certayne Noble woman did call the Maister of her children, to the office of a Preacher (or Minister) and did order and consecrate him by the imposition of her hands,A strange ordinatiō of a Preacher. and of her apron which she did vse in steed of a stole. Whether any such imposition of hands, aprons, or kyrtles, were vsed to these first Prelates by Q. Elizabeth afterwards I know not: but I haue bene credibly enformed, that Maister Whitgift would not be Byshop of Canterbury vntill he had kneeled downe, & the Queene had laid her hands on his head: by which I suppose, ex opere operato; he receaued no grace.

                  ABOVT THE TRVE Author of the Apology for the Oath of Allegiance. §. I.
                  FIRST then, for that it hath byn sufficiently obserued before, and the reader hath byn aduertised also therof, that in all my aduersaries allegatiōs of my words (when they are in any number) he commonly falsifieth them, or offereth some other abuse to the same, by altering them to his purpose, or inserting his owne among mine, and yet setting downe all in a different letter, as if meerly they were myne; I shal be inforced as occasion is offered, to repeat my owne lynes, as they ly in my owne Booke, that therby I may be vnderstood, and his answere to me conceaued, which hardly can be, as he hudleth vp both the one, and the other, desiring to walke in a mist of darknes: the euent shall shew, whether I speake this vpon good grounds, or no. Now to the narration it selfe.
                  And so first hauing receaued from my friend in England the aforesayd Apology of triplex Cuneus, concerning the new Oath of Allegiance, now called the Kings, and perused the same with some attention, I wrote backe againe to my sayd friend, as followeth, being the very first lines.

And yet for so much as you require it so earnestly at my hands, and that the party is to returne presently, I shall say somewhat with the greatest breuity that I can: albeit I do

                  This was one of my reasons, besides diuers other, that I alleaged in that place, all which for so much as it pleaseth Maister Barlow to deferre the answere thereof to another place afterwards, and now to satisfy a reason only of certaine contemptuous speach vsed against the Pope, and Cardinall Bellarmine, I shall here also make repetition of my wordes therein. Thus then I wrote.
In like manner wheras his Maiestie is knowne to be a Prince of most honorable respects in treaty,
                           See Letter pag. 4. and vsage of others, especially men of honour, & dignity, it is to be thought, that he would neuer haue consented, if he had but seene the Booke with any attention, that those phrases of contempt not only against the Pope (at least as a temporall Prince) but neyther against the Cardinall, calling him by the name of Maister Bellarmine, should haue passed. For so much,What his Maiesty in honour would haue misliked. as both the Emperour and greatest Kings of Christēdome, do name that dignity with honour. And it seemeth no lesse dissonant, to cal a Cardinal Maister, then if a man should call the chiefest dignities of our Crowne by that name, as M. Chancellour, M. Treasurer, M. Duke, M. Earie, M. Archbishop, M. Bancroft, which I asure my selfe, his Maiestie would in law of Honour condemne, if any externe Subiect, or Prince should vse to men of that Sate in our countrey, though he were of different religion. Wherfore, I rest most assured, that this proceeded, either out of the Ministers lacke of modesty, or charity: & that if his Maiestie had had the perusall of the Booke, before it came forth, he would presently haue giuen a dash of his pen ouer it, with effectuall order to remedy such ouersights of inciuility.
                  
                  So I then. And if I were deceiued in iudgement as now it seemeth I was, for that it plea

                        amed in the booke yet in reason can it not be taken euill at my handes that followed those coniectures, and sought rather to deryue vpon others the pointes which in that booke I misliked, then to touch so great a personage as

was, and is my Prince. Yea in all duty and good manners I had obligation to conceale his Maiesties name, for so much as himselfe concealed the same: and when any Prince will not be knowne to be a doer in action, as in this it seemeth he would not at that tyme, I know not with what dutifull respect any subiect might publish the same, though he did suspect that he had part therin. For that subiects must seeme to know no more in Princes affaires then themselues are willing to haue known. And consequently, when I saw that his Maiesty concealed his name, I thought it rather duty to seeke reasons to confirme & couer the same, then by presūption to enter into Princes secrets, and to reueale them.
                  And hauing thus rendred a reason of my doings in this behalfe, it remaineth that wee see what Maister Barlow hath to say against it; for somewhat he must say, wheresoeuer he find it, & though neuer so impertinent to the purpose, hauing taken vpon him to contradict, and plead against me in all pointes, and reaceaued his

                     ee before hand, as may appeare, by the possession he hath gotten of a rich benefice, and hopeth for more.
                  First then he runneth to a ridiculous imitation of my former reasons, whereby to seeke out whether Persons the Iesuite were the true author of my Lettter or no, & from passage to passage doth furnish his style with some railing offals out of M. VVatsons Quodlibets against him, which though the author recalled, and sore repented at his death, as is publikely knowne and testified by them that stood by, and heard him: yet this charitable Prelate wil not suffer his synne to dye with him, but will needs rayse, and reuiue the same agayne after his death, and make it his owne, by this sinfull & vnchristian exprobration therof. But what maketh this to the purpose we haue in hand? surely nothing but to shew the malice, and misery of the slaunderer. For let Father Persons be a ranging voluntary runegate, and Hispanized Camelion, as here he is termed, or any thing els which an intemperate, loose, or lewde tongue can deuise for his con
                        •
                     umely,

what is all this to the matter in hand, that is to say, to the writing of the former letter, or who was the author thereof? Doth not here malyce, and folly striue which of them shall haue the vpper hand in M. Barlow?
                  
                  But yet one point he hath more of singularity in folly, which I suppose will goe neere to make the reader laugh, if he be not in choler with him before for his malice. For wheras I had professed my selfe to be perswaded vpon the reasons set downe, that his Maiestie was not the penner of the Apologie, though it was printed by Barker his Printer, and set forth authoritate Regia, by the Kings authority, alleadging for example, that first of the minister T. M. knowne afterwardes to be Thomas Morton, who published some yeares gone, his lying and slaunderous Discouery against Catholikes, and gaue it this approbatio
                        •
                     , that it was set forth by direction from Superiours (though perhaps no Superiour euer read it) and the like I sayd, might be suspected that this other Apologie furnished with authoritate Regia, might perhaps proue to be the worke of some other T. M. to wit, Thomas Montague, somewhat neere to his Maiestie, by reason of his Ministeriall office, which then he held: all which declaration notwithstanding Maister Barlow is so set to haue men thinke, that I knew and perswaded my selfe, that it was the Kings booke indeed,
                        Barlowe pag. 5. and that by those two letters T. M. I meant Tua, or Tanta Maiestas. By those ciphers (saith he) of T. M. if he will speake without equiuocation he meant Tua, or Tanta Maiestas.
                     M. Barlowes sharp wit. And haue you euer heard such a dreame, or deliration in one that professeth wit? Marke his sharpenes. I doe say, that this second T. M. doth signify Thomas Montague, & do sett it downe expresly in the margent. I doe describe the person, and office neere the king, as being then Deane of his Chapell though I name it not. I doe shew probabilities, how he might presume to write, and set forth that booke authoritate Regia, by shewing it only to the king. And how could I then by those two letters of T. M. meane Tua, or Tanta Maiestas? or what sense of grammer, or coherence

of phrase would those latyn wordes make, for so much as I wrot in English? what shall I say? is not he worthy to pretend a Bishopricke, that hath no more wit then this? But let vs goe forward to examyne other poyntes.

                     Maister Bellarmine, and his defence consisteth in these poyntes, distended impertinently throughout diuers pages. That his Maiestie being so great a King, might call such an vpstart officer, that knoweth not where to rake for the beginning of his sublimity, Maister. That Christ our Sauiour was called Rabbi by Nicodemus, & Rabboni by Mary Magdalen:

                     e Tydder, this and this haue I done for your cause, I hope you wil reward me: what reward would you thinke that she would haue bestowed vpon him, for so great a courtesy? And this shalbe sufficient to shew the vanity of this euasion, wherein he pleaseth himselfe very much, and entertayneth his pen for diuers pages, as I haue said, pretermitting three or foure other in
                        •
                     tances of mine of much more force, for prouing my coniecture, that his Maiestie himselfe penned not the Apologie, promising to answer them after in their due place: but this place had bene most due to the matter in hand if the Minister had found himselfe ready, and sufficiently fraught with substance to refute them, and therfore it is to be presupposed, he would not haue pretermitted the occasion for shew at least of some furniture in this beginning, for so much as he hunteth so greedily after all occasions to say somewhat, though nothing to the purpose at all.
                  Well then, thus remayneth the argument of this first Paragraph, about the true Author of the Apology (which now his Maiestie confesseth to be his) somewhat discussed, as you haue heard: the rest remayning for the place that M. Barlow hath promised to say more thereof afterwardes. The summe of all hitherto treated being, that I and infinit others being strangers to that which was done in secret, & thinking it not conuenient, nor dutifull for any subiect of his Mati•. to ascribe vnto so great a Prince, a thing that might be denyed afterwards, or called in controuersy by many: I did vpon the reasons alleadged, perswade my selfe, that it was the doing of some of his Maiesties Chaplaines, & namely of Maister Thomas Montague, as before I haue said by some generall licence, or approbation of his Highnes, rather then to haue bene penned by his Maiesty himselfe. And vpon this ground, did I frame my Letter

                     ure to Catholikes by this new exacted oath, I proposed some of the Apologers words in his Preamble, concerning the detestatiō of the Powder-treason,About the powder-treason. in which detestation, though I willingly ioyned with him, yet complayned I of the iniquity of some that vrged continually the hatred therof against innocent men, for them that were culpable, contrary to his Maiesties honorable meaning, as appeared by the words vttered both in his Proclamation, & speach in the Parlament. To which passage of mine M. Barlow cōming to answer, setteth downe first my words and discourse in a different letter, as though they were punctually myne indeed, & nothing peruerted or corrupted by him, & then playeth vpon them as though this ground had bene true and sincere indeed. And for that this is his perpetuall vse throughout the whole answer, I shall for this once, put down his words, & after also my owne, whereby you may take a document now, at the beginning, how to trust him in the rest. Thus then he beginneth his first Paragraph num. 18.

                     The monstrous, rare nay neuer heard of treacherous, famous, and infamous attempt, plotted within these few yeares here in England (of the powder-treason) infinite in cruelty, singular from all exāple, crying loudly for vengeance from heauen &c.

Counsell of Holland, vpon priuate reuenge: as also that of Edenborough in Scotland, where the like trayne of Powder was laid for the cruell murther of his Maiesties Father, which not succeeding, his death was achieued by another no lesse bloudy, and barbarous violence.
                     But why (I pray you) is this wofull attempt of those vnfortunate gētlemen, so often brought in againe,The odious & oft repetition of the Powder treason. and repeated almost in euery corner of this booke? Are they not executed, that were culpable therof? And are not other Catholikes deliuered from the guylt therof by the long and diligent search of iustice made thereabout? The Minister himselfe confesseth in his very next lynes, the equity of his Maiesty to be such, as he professed in his Proclamation, & Parlament-speach, that he would not vse other Catholikes the worse for that. Wherof it followeth that he held them for guiltlesse: and that all those pressures both of conscience, and externall affliction which since that tyme they haue suffered,The powder treasō not so much a cause as an effect of Catholiks tribulatiō. and doe at this present, were designed before that, and begun also to be put in execution (as indeed they were) and that the powder-treason was not a cause of these afflictions, but an effect rather: that is to say, that those gentlemen forseeing or knowing the course that was designed to be taken, and partly also put in practice, resolued vppon that miserable medium to their owne destruction, & publick calamity.
                     But alas is there no end of exprobration against the Innocent, for the nocent? No compassion? No commiseration? If the clemency of his Maiesty in his gracious Proclamation (as here is confessed) gaue security, that notwithstanding that headlong action of those few Catholicke gentlemen, none of the profession should be the worse vsed for that cause: how commeth it to passe, that so many agri

                        Arist. praedicam. c. 3. and can neuer be without them: and consequently wheresoeuer specificall vnity, or agreement is not found, there can be no indiuidual. As for example, if Peter and Paul agree not in being men (which is the species) they can neuer agree in the indiuidual properties of being particuler, and singuler men, though contrarywise they may haue perfect agreement and likenes in the first, to wit ion being men, albeit they do differ, and disagree in the later, as hauing different indiuiduall, & personall proprieties, whereby they are distinguished, & made seuerall men. And so, to apply all this to our purpose, those three powder-plots by me mentioned, may well agree in the species, or genus, of being powder-plots, though they haue some particular, and indiuiduall differences, whereby in some partes they disagree, and are distinguished, but how they may agree in their indiuidual proprieties of being like powder-plotes, and yet not agree in the specificall,M. Barlow ridiculous. or genericall nature of powder-plotes, that is to say, without being powder-plotes at all, I see not how it can be imagined, and I suppose, that M. Doctor Barlow wilbe laughed at by all Logitians in Cambridge for setting downe such doctrine, contrary to all rules of Logicke.
                  And so much the more, for that a little before in the very same page, he vaūteth of his skill in Logicke, imputing great want therof vnto me, saying, That wheras I had deuided the Apology into three partes, it was made to my hand by others,Another folly of M. Barlow.

Gouernour the Prince of Parma were his subiects; and little it importeth, whether they were in open or priuy rebellion. For suppose that the other that practised the powder-plot in England had bene in publike rebellion also against his Mat•e. for what cause soeuer, yet had their powder plot bene a powder treason, nor would M. Barlow haue durst to defend the contrary; and consequently, this plot of Antwerp must be graūted to haue bene of the same nature or species at least, with that of England, albeit they had some indiuiduall differences the one from the other.

                      for the ruyne of his Maiesties father, when he commeth to answer, he is exceedingly troubled, and entangled how to defend it, & therefore laying aside reasoning, he falleth to open rayling; saying: But by his noting of the last (Powder-plot of Scotland) this Censurer discouereth the rancor of his hart against our Soueraigne: for though the execution of Parricides, and murthers vpon Princes haue est soones alighted vpon some of the greatest, and best of that Royall sort that euer were, and therefore no dishonour to them, nor their posterity: yet to cast vp such a disasterous example in his Maiesties teeth, proueth well, that he is sory, that his Maiestie escaped the like perill, whome he so earnestly wished to be his Fathers successour in such a fortune.

Barlow bringeth in the Apostles definition of an Oath to be the end of all controuersies, though I acknowledge it to be his sentence, and most true: yet not a definition. Nor doe I see, how M. Barlow wilbe able handsomely to defend the same. For if the common axiome of Logitians knowne to euery scholler that studieth that art be true, that Definitio & defini

                        Aristot. l. 2. priorum cap. 8. so as whatsoeuer is comprehended vnder the one, is comprehended also vnder the other: and contrariwise whatsoeuer agreeth not to the one, agreeth not to the other: then cannot this proposition of the Apostle be a definition of an Oath, and consequently M. Barlow doth erre grossely in calling it so.
                  Now then that this matter is so, and that euery Oath cannot end all controuersies, nor that euery controuersy is ended with an Oath, is euident by experience.All controuersies are not to be ended by swearing. For how many swearers haue you, that will offer to sweare twenty Oathes in a controuersy betweene them and others, if therby they might end, and gaine the controuersy? But the other party admitteth them not, for that he hath not so much credit of sincerity in their Oath, that they wll sweare truly, as to belieue them. And so also on the other side, how many controuersies are there ended dayly without Oathes, and many cannot with Oathes. As for example, if M. Barlow should owe a peece of money, and being vrged to pay it, should offer to forsweare it, that were not like to end the controuersy, but rather the laying downe of the money: Ergo, all Oathes are not able to end all cōtrouersies, nor all controuersies are determinable by Oathes.
                  You will demaund then, what is S. Paul his meaning, when he saith, as here M. Barlow relateth him, that an Oath is the end of all controuersies? Surely S. Paules meaning had bene

And for this cause he saith, That an Oath is the end of all controuersy for confirmatiō of truth in the behalf of the swearer,

Paul in this place, containeth no definitiō of an oath, as fondly M. Barlow dreameth, but expresseth rather the effect of an oath for confirmation of truth in the behalf of the swearer: which word of confirmation M. Barlow craftily left out, & thrust in two greeke words

If it were true, that such were sound, doth the discouery of some such plotts in some Catholikes infer an impossibility, that no Catholike can beare any true Allegiance?

                  Furthermore, if it be impossible for any Catholicke to beare true allegiance in his hart, what is his Maiestie like to gaine by vrging them to sweare? For that either they must leaue to be Catholickes, or els swearing helpeth the matter nothing. For while they are Romish Catholickes you hould they cannot beare true Allegiance.

But good Reader, shall we intreat M. Barlow once throughout all his booke, to make a good consequence. When did we euer deny, that the vse of an Oath in generall is not ancient, but that this Parlament-Oath in England lately deuised, is new both for time (for that M. Barlow doth expresly in this very page, graunt that it was procured from his Maiesties prudent cogitation) and for the forme, and contentes including

matter both of ciuill Obedience vnto the Temporall Prince, and spirituall Disobedience to the Ecclesiasticall Prelate. And as for the second poynt of swearing to the intention of the iudge, when he is lawfull, and proceedeth lawfully, whosoeuer hath or will read any of the last two Books in Answere and Reply to M. Morton, will see it often, and often repeated, that no Equiuocation at all is admitted in that case: or when the examination is about religion, and con

                  BVT now after long gadding abroad to shew, that an Oath in generall is not vnlawfull, nor the matter of an Oath new, and the like, as you haue heard; he returneth home for a while, saying:

                           •
                        
                      
                     And now will we follow him to examine the weight of this pressure. And then, as if I had spoken to his Maiestie, when I spake to the Apologer T. M. (
                        •
                     or this iniury he offereth me at euery turne,Iniury offered by M. Barlow to the Author of the Epistle. to thrust in his Maiesty to vndergo my speache, meant to a Minister) he saith, that I picke a quarrel about the word Only, vsed by the Apologer, as a diminitiue phrase of the pressure laid vpon Catholikes by this Oath; and he maketh me speake after an ironicall scoffing manner, saying: that the King 
                        •
                     seth the word Only, when he talketh of the imposition of this Oath vpon Catholikes, as a matter of small, or no pressure, saying, That (only) an Oath was deuised to try their fidelity: and then he maketh me to add these wordes of Ironicall Sarcasmus, or bitter iest, as he calleth it, and setteth it downe in a different letter as my proper wordes, to wit, that I should say, as, If the taking of this Oath were so lightly

to be esteemed as to be thurst vpon Catholickes, with an (only:) wheras I haue no such manner of speach, as the Reader may see in my owne wordes set downe at large in the XII. number of the first Paragraph. And therfore this perpetuall custome of falsifying in euery place lightly where he pretendeth to cite my wordes, would weary a man to deale with him. But that I haue resolued to haue patience with him yet somewhat further.
                  My speach then about this word Only, was as you haue heard, that wheras, the Apologer had sayd that his Maiesties will was, that none of the Catholike profession should be the worse vsed for the powder-plot, he presently adioyned, That Only at the next sitting of Parlament a forme of an Oath was framed to be taken by all &c. By which word Only, I sayd, that the Apologer seemed to make small accompt of taking, or not taking this Oath; for so much as he supposed the Catholicke people to haue no agrieuance, or pressure therby, for that otherwise, it had not bene true, that they should not fare the worse for the sayd powder-treason.
                  And what will M. Barlow say to this? You shall heare his owne wordes. Who knoweth not, sayth he, that this word Only, doth not so much signify an hypocoristicall alleuiation, as a compendiary limitation? This is very high and profound stuffe, as you see, and most of his Readers I suppose must goe to the greeke Lexicon before they passe any further, if they will vnderstand him. But let vs see how he doth explicate himselfe by an example.
                        Barl. p. 20. 
                     He that sayd to our Sauiour (sayth he) Only speake the word, did not thereby extenuate the power of Christ,
                     
                        Matth. 8. 8. 
                     as is healing in absence by a speach had bene a more easy miracle, then by aproach to touch the party, but thereby wished a course more easefull to the body, not lesse powerfull to shew the deity of our Sauiour. But to what end is all this? Doe not wee say the very same that the word Only is a diminitiue phrase in this place, signifying, that wheras our Sauiour offered to goe with the Centurion for the curing of the sickeman, he answered, that his Only word was sufficient, excluding the other of bodily going, as not being necessary. Wherefore the other Commentary

And so fareth it in our case. But if that Noble man should demaund at their hands a thing that importeth their liues, much more their soules, and life euerlasting: then would they iustly cry out, and complaine of this word Only, as gu

                  About vrging Catholickes to sweare against their consciences, this our Doctour determineth peremptorily, as it were out of his Chayre, in this sort: You must know that a conscience may be misled by errour, or sti

                     I presume no Catholicke in England will deny to sweare all ciuill obedience, that he oweth to his Maiestie, or that any subiect hath euer in former Catholicke tymes sworne to their leige Lords, and Princes, or do in other Countryes at this day. Is not this playne inough? And why then did M. Barlow cut them of? What playne dealing is there in this? Let vs heare how he prosecuteth his

                     alumniation against me. Treason hatched in the hart cannot conceale it selfe, saith he, from vttering, though in hidden termes. For obserue those words,
                     
                        Pag 22. al obedience that he oweth to his Maiestie, what is that? or how farre extends it? S. Peter stretcheth it without limitation; Submit your selues to all manner of ordinance for the Lords sake. So he. What? all manner of ordinance?1. Pet. 2.13. and without limitation at all? and that in a time of Infidell Princes, as was that of S. Peter, who might, and did ordaine many thinges against the Lord? How then could the Apostles warrant their answere to the Magistrates of the Iewes, that they were to obey God rather then men, that is to say, to Christ rather then to them, that were Magistrates?
                  But I would aske here Maister Barlow, that is such a Grecian, and bringeth in Greeke phrases to no purpose at all, why he had not set downe the sentēce of S. Peter in Greeke, which is most different from his English? and why he doth translate here,

So as heere it seemeth to me, that this Doctor remayneth much foyled about Aduerbes in generall: now let vs see, what he can say about swearing freely in particular.

                  AS concerning this matter, M. Barlow after his former discourse about Aduerbes commeth to handle the point it selfe of freedome permitted to Catholickes in taking the Oath, beginning thus:

                     e? or Catholickes in England should take the Oath for auoyding the penaltyes of the Statute? whether this choice, I say, be absolutely free, or no? And I shewed before both out of Aristotle according to Philosophy, and out of Schoole-Doctours according to Diuinity, that this was not perfect freedome.
                  For albeit Aristotle saith, the Merchant his act in casting out his goodes is simpliciter inuoluntarium, & voluntarium secundum quid, absolute inuoluntary, and voluntary but in part: & the Scholemē on the other side, that it is simply volūtary and in part inuoluntary: yet in effect, they say all the same, in different respects; for that Aristotle calleth it simply inuoluntary, in respect of the obiect alone, without consideration of the circumstances, that do accompany the same, in which sense no doubt the act of casting out his goods is simply inuolūtary in the Merchāt. And the Schole Doctors doe call it simply voluntary in respect of the obiect accompanied, and conioyned with the circumstances, to wit, present perill of life, and the like; which being considered, the Merchant doth simply & absolutely resolue, that all thinges considered, it is better to cast out his goodes then to d

                     taine them: & so in this sense of the Schole Deuines, it is simpliciter voluntarium, simply voluntary, and in the other sense of Aristotle simply inuoluntary; for that simply and absolutely he would not cast out his goodes, if it were not for the perill, and danger of his life, which is a most ponderous circumstance, and ouerweigheth the ballance o

                      the whole consultation.
                  And this is our present case also, about taking the Oath by those very many Catholicks, which the Apologer saith tooke it freely, if they were so many. For if they were Catholicks, and were informed, that there were diuers points therein contayned against their Religion, which must necessarily

                     rom taking the same, and yet on the other syde there was losse of liberty, and goodes in refusing the same; then sayd I, that neither according to Philosophy or Diuinity, was this deliberation of theirs altogeather free.The free acceptāce of penall lawes. And wheras M. Barlow would inferre therof, that thē 
                     there were no free subiect, for that all Common Wealths do propose lawes with penalties: I answere that there are two sortes of men in a Common wealth, good and bad: the good do willingly submit themselues to the lawes penall, made by the Prince, and Common wealth, and that for conscience sake, as S. Paul prescribeth, without respect of punishment, where they see no iniustice, & offence to God cōmanded;1. Tim. 1.9
                           •
                        
                      in which sense the sayd Apostle saith, that the law is not giuen vnto the righteous man (which is repeated here also by M. Barlow) of which sort it is to be presupposed, that a great part of euery Cōmon wealth consisteth: but to the wicked.
                  But now there are others, which being euill men, & slaues to their owne passions, do repyne at good lawes, and for these it is necessary, that punishments and penalties should be appoynted to inforce them to obey: and albeit this choyce of theyrs is not altogeather free, according to the nature of freedome before declared; yet is the coactiō necessary, and profitable to themselues, nor haue they any iust reason, but only their disorderly passion to refuse the same, and consequently it is no reason, that they should haue free choice, and freedome of election permitted vnto them, in a matter so preiudiciall to the common wealth, and to themselues.
                  All which is different in the case of Catholickes in taking the oath repugnant to theyr consciences. For as euill men doe not follow conscience, and iudgement, but passion as now hath bene said, in not obeying penall lawes: so may they be iustly forced thereunto: and in that sense may yet truly be said to be all free, that is to say, free to do euill without punishment. But Catholiks following the dictamen of their consciences, concerning pointes of their faith, receiued and continued in England since the beginning of christianity, cannot with any equity

                     ecessary to make a thing inuoluntary, to wit, when the party hath no leasure to deliberate: and vpon this he standeth much, as radix libertatis, the root of liberty or fre choice, and foundeth himselfe in the doctrine of Michael Medina a Catholick Schoole Doctor of our dayes, and therof inferreth, for that the Catholicks haue a tyme to deliberate to take the Oath, and after deliberation haue choice to take it, or not, those that take it, take it freely. But I would put to M. Barlow this case.M. Barlow hardly vrged. If a thiefe should meete him alone in a place, where he were not afraid to be discouered, and should will him, either to giue him his purse or his little finger to be cut of, and should giue him a whole day to deliberate, and after to choose, whether he would loose his purse, or his finger, and he chooseth to loose his purse, is this action free from inforcement, for that he hath time to deliberate, and after liberty to make his choice? What man of sense will say this, but M. Barlow? Or will M. Barlow himselfe say, that he gaue his purse

                        limited scope for the iudgment to deliberate, as who would say, that euery free action must haue an vnlimited scope of time to deliberate first, or that otherwise it were not free. As if M. Barlow when he is riding from London to Lincolne, and hath two waies to take, must needs haue an vnlimited scope of time for his determination, which way to ride, and this must be, not an hower, nor halfe a day, nor a day, nor a moneth, nor a yeare, but an vnlimited scope, so as he may sit a whole yeare, nay seauen yeares, yea twenty, or more to deliberate which way he will choose: which were good for his flocke, for so perchance the wolfe should neuer come amongst them. But was there euer such a Philosopher? or any such Philosophy taught before, or Diuinity? had he not euill luck at this his first stumbling vpon Medina so to mistake him.
                  But you will say, what doth then Medina meane whē he saith, that the first condition required to liberty is indeterminatio iudicij ad deliberandum,

                     Medina his example is taken from the difference betweene the choice of a brute beast, & a man, for that the brute beast hath his iudgement, or estimatiue

As when you propose meate to a beast that is hungry, he cannot but be moued to admit the same, as thinking that best in this his estimate, or brutish iudgement: but mans iudgement, or vnderstanding is not so determined to one par

                      by instinct of nature, but may apply it selfe also to consider of the opposite.
                  I shall alleadge the wordes of Medina,
                     
                        Medina in 1. 2. q 6. a. 2. p. 72. which will make all the matter cleare. Libertatem voluntatis (saith he) antecedit indeterminatio, & indifferentia iudicij ex parte intellecius: appetitio emin sequitur cognitionem: igitur vniuersa libertas nostra ex cognitione originem trahit. Before the liberty of the will goeth the indete

                     mination, & indifferency of the iudgement or estimate, on the behalfe of the vnderstanding, for that the appetite, or will doth follow knowledg; & therefore all the liberty of our will hath her beginning or origen frō knowledge. So Medina: laying this for a foundation, that if the iudgement in a man, or estimate in a beast doe not first know, & discerne the obiect, there can no appetition, or choice follow in the will or appetite But Medina doth explaine himselfe further, shewing that this knowledge of the vnderstanding or estimate, which he calleth here iudgement, if it goe not before the choice, no choice at all can be made: bu
                        •

                     mined, or tied to any one, as he proueth by the example of a sheepe, whose vnderstanding or estimate is so determined by instinct of nature to fly a wolfe, when shee seeth him, as shee cannot thinke on the contrary; and consequently can haue no election to fly him, or not fly him; as not only a man, but

a dog also may, which hath strengh, and courage to resist him, and fight with him.
                  But let vs heare the rest of Medina his discourse to shew M. Barlow his ignorance.

As for example: forsomuch as a sheep hath this iudgment imprinted in her by nature, that a wolfe is to be fled, shee cannot choose but fly the same. But when the iudgement is in the power of the Iudger, so as he is able to iudge this, or the opposite, or contrary thereof; then the choice ensuing is free, and indi
                           •

                        ll, which freedome as you see doth consist formally in the will, but fundamentally in the iudgement, or vnderstanding.
                  
                  Hitherto is the discourse of Medina about the two partes, wherein the liberty of choice consisteth both of men and beastes, to wit, iudgement, and will: though concerning free will in man, he referreth his Reader to a further, and far larger disputation, wherein he saith, he is to dispute fusissimè contra Lutheranos, most largely against the Lutherans, that deny free will. And then he commeth to conclude with these two conditions before mentioned, related, but grossely misunderstood by M. Barlow, of indetermination, or indifferency of the vnderstanding, and choice of will. Modò definitum sit (saith he) quòd ad libertatem dua condi

                     y. And is not this a very sheepish apprehension indeed? Did not M. Barlow read all this discourse now by me related in Medina himselfe, how the sheepes iudgement, estimate, or vnderstanding is tied, and determined to one part only by instinct of nature? to wit, that shee must fly, when shee seeth the wolfe? And how could he conceiue then, that Medina should meane, that this sheep must haue time to cōsult, whether shee must fly, or no? Hath he euer seene any sheep in this deliberation? Men-sheep may well do it, and ought to do it, & would God his Lincolne-sheep, that by this false proceeding of his, & many other of his words & actiōs do or may discouer him for a wolfe indeed, would enter into serious deliberatiō how to fly him for safety of their soules, whereunto according to his owne doctrine they are allowed an vnlimited scope for their iudgement to deliberate. God grant their wils be correspōdent to make choice of that, which God in their iudgements shall tell them to be the best.
                  But now to his last conclusion, which is, as before you haue heard him say, that this is the very case betweene the King, and his subiects in this matter of the Oath, so that, the very refusall after deliberation (saith he) argues that they

had liberty of choice, to take or not, but in refusing it no loyalty of a

Barlow dealeth not vprightly, as commonly neuer he doth in alleaging my words, but with notorious corruptions. I shalbe forced to repeat againe briefly, what I then said. My wordes were these.

                         of any sort of Equiuocation in matters touching faith and religion. And in these I hearesay, that the Iesuites were among the chiefe, and most forward, as heere also is confessed: who notwithstanding before were most accused, bayted, and exagitated, both in bookes, pulpits, and tribunalls, for allowing, in some points, the lawfull vse of Equiuocation.
                     
                     About which doubt, Catholikes, according to their rule of subordination, and spirituall obedience in such affaires, referring the matter to the iudgement, and consultation of their supreme Pastour, whome by the principles of their religion they belieue, that our Sauiour giueth assistance, for the direction of mens soules, they receyued from him, after due deliberation, this answere.
                           See the Breue to. Kai. Octob. 1606. 
                        That the whole Oath as it lay could not be admitted with the integrity of Catholike faith For that albeit diuers parts therof were lawfull, to wit, all such clauses, as appertayned to the promise of ciuil and temporall obedience: yet other things being interlaced and mixt therwith, which doe detract from the spirituall authority of their said highest Pastour (at least wise indirectly) the whole Oath, as it lyeth, was made thereby vnlawfull.
                     And this I vnderstand to be the substance of the Popes resolution and answer, though all these particularities be not set downe in his Breues, but only the Oath declared to be vnlawfull in conscience to Catholike men, as it lieth, without distinction. And what malicious tricke of the Diuel then this may be thought, where sheepe do make recourse to their spirituall Pastour, in so great and important occasions of their soules, as these are, I see not. Doe English Catholicks any other thing in this, then that which all English subiects, both great & small, learned & vnlearned haue done, and practised from our first Christian Kinges,

                      You shall see, how he will gnibble at the matter, as a mouse at the cheese-vate, and cannot enter. He saith first, that I am in my element, when I am in this argument of recourse to Rome, vsed to be made from age to age, by our ancient Christian English people, Prelates and Princes, & that there is scarce any Epistle, Preface, Pamphlet, Booke, or Petition of myne, but that this is therein the Cyprestree, to make Rome the loadstone for drawing thither the tryall of our gould in both senses, and the like: That I borrowed all from Cardinall Allen in his Apology: that we haue receyued full satisfactory answers in this behalfe, to wit, that when the Bishops of Rome in purer times did beare thē
                     selues as religious members, not as presumptuous heads of the Church, and lyued as ghostly Fathers to counsaile, not as Superiors to controle, our realme being then also rude, and learning scant, Religion new sprong vp, and no where setled, I say then, and in those dayes, M. Barlow graunteth, that the recourse was made to Rome, but yet vpon deuotion, and mere necessity, and not then neither, without leaue of the Prince.

                        cted the Subiects of our Soueraigne King to sweare their obedience, eyther for his Diuinity, or Piety we haue heard nothing. Whereunto the answer is easy, for if you haue not heard therof, it is for that you are loath to heare so much good, as you may, of his Holines in both points. His profession was not the faculty of Diuinity, but rather of Ciuill, and Canon law, before God did choose him to the place & dignity, where now he is. It is well knowne that his Holines hath great sufficiency also in the other, for discharging of his obligation in that high Office: and hath moreouer so many learned men about him in all sciences to consult withall, whē matters of weight do occurre, as this poore exception of the Hereticke about learning in his Holines, is a good witnes of his want of better matter, what to speake to the purpose.
                  And as for his Piety, which is the other point, let his Holines life, and actions be looked vpon, as we know they are by all Heretikes in the world, and curiously pried into; not only at home in their owne Countreys, but in Rome it selfe, where many do go to certify thēselues in this, and sundry other like pointes, and do depart much edified therby, and sundry of them conuerted dayly by seeing the contrary to that which before they heard: wherof my selfe among others, can be a good witnes, that haue seene the effect hereof in sundry of our Nation, as others can say the like by theirs. And this amongst other things is very notable and knowne, spoken and confessed by all sortes of people in Rome to be in him, to wit, an Angelicall purity of life, throughout the whole course therof: in

so much that he was neuer yet stained with the least blemish of suspicion to the contrary. Which publike voice,The purity of life in Paulus Quintus. & testimony how well it hath bene deserued of M. Barlow & his Mates

                     that he is a rash speaker, and an headdy vndertaker, of a most violent spirit, and impatient of contradiction, in whatsoeuer he hath but once imagined. If this, I say, be true (which God forbid in so great a Church-man) now surely he is not the fittest Iudge to be resorted vnto in cases of conscience, especially of such a nature, and consequence as this in hand. So he.
                  Where first the Reader may note, that he sayth, he wil not enter into the Pope his personall qualities, and yet he doth: shewing thereby, that his aboundance of malice ouercame his iudgement, & first intention. And if you stand attent, you shal see, that Sathan the Author, & Inspirer of all malignity, to worke this Heretikes greater shame, made him lay hands vpō such a calūniation as all the world both Catholiks, & Heretiks that haue any knowledg of his Holines person will testify, to be a meere slander,M. Barlowes wāt of wit in accusing the Pope. to accuse Cardinall Burghesius, before he was Pope, to be a rash speaker, an headdy vndertaker, a violent spirit, & impatient of contradiction, is as probable an accusatiō among thē that know him, as to say, that S. Francis was couetous, S. Thomas vnlearned, S. Bernard indeuout, S.

And this is so euident, & notorius in the present calūniation, that whosoeuer did but come to Rome, and did discourse of Cardinalls, of their qualities, and conditions (as men are wont to doe) but much more, if they conuersed with him, should vnderstād

So as any other slaunder, or calumination might sooner find place against him, then this.
                  And whereas he alleageth some of the secular English Priestes to haue bene Authors of this false accusation against his Holines, quoting in the margent M. Bluet &c. whereby he would signify, that he, and his fellowes had affirmed the same;
                        Anno Domini 1602. it seemeth that he doth allude vnto the time, when the said M.

No doubt, but that the fal

And how false soeuer he was in the allegation, certaine it is, that he dealt most wickedly in the application of all to the person of his Holines that now liueth. And this much shall suffice about this matter.
                  It followeth pag 27. & 28. after he had discharged such a storme against the Popes owne person, as now you haue heard, for his medling in this Oath, and giuing his decisiō therof, he sayth, that this was to be Iudg in his owne cause, alleaging a Poet for his proofe, about sur & latro, one pleading at the barre, & the other sitting at the bench. But doth not the malicious man see, that this his cauillation toucheth the interest of all Princes, as though they might not be Iudges, or giue sentence in cases wherein themselues haue a part, if law stand with thē. For to cause other men to do it in their name, by their authority, is as much as to do it themselues. And what did the Pope more in this case thē this? making a decision by counsaile of his learned men, according to Christian law, that this case of England touched points of Religion concerning the Sea Apostolick; which authority no Pope can infringe or diminish without sinne, if he would; for that it was giuē not only to him, but to his ant

Nor is the word supposing vsed by me, applied to some Catholikes, as though they supposed; but to my selfe, that I supposed: and so this change of the person, as you see, is a foule ouersight in repeating his aduersaries argument. There followeth the like change of the subiect, for my supposall was not, that the Pope had to do in England, but that we treated, and spake in that place of Catholike people, according to Catholike Doctrine, and of Catholike consciences, not of Protestants consciences, or iudgements, for that the question was not, whether Protestan

                     s with a good conscience might take the Oath, or not, but Catholikes with the integrity of their Religion. Out of which supposall is inferred, that forsomuch,

as Catholike doctrine in all Schools of the world, as well of Spaine, France, Italy, and others, do teach, and define, that all Catholike people, whether they be farre, or neere, without exception, are equally subiect to the supreme Pastour of the Church, wherof they are members: it followeth, I say, that dwell they neuer so farre of, they cannot be called, nor accounted Messis aliena to their said vniuersall Pastour.
                  But let vs heare M. Barlow further, vttering other ignorances intolerable in the eares of learned men. But before this supposall (saith he) be brought into a positiue, and resolute conclusion, will require more tyme &c. What, M. Barlow this supposall, that we treated of Catholike people only and according to Catholike Doctrine, and not of Protestants? My wordes are playne, do you read them ouer againe, supposing as we doe (quoth I) that we treat of Catholike people only, and according to Catholik doctrine. You see my words: this was my supposall: what difficulty is there now, to reduce them to a positiue, and resolute conclusion, saying and affirming resolutely that which then I supposed, to wi

Do you see, how hard a matter this is to bring a supposall into a conclusion? And doth not your Reader see, to what straites of absurdityes, your folly hath brought you?
                  But yet the Reader must further know, that there is included in your wordes, greater ignorance perhaps, thē any of the former; for you imagine, as by your sequent wordes appeareth, that a supposall is of much lesse certainty, then is a positiue, and res

Let vs see then M. Barlow his acumen in this matter. Thus he writeth of me, and my supposall.

Or shall it be but likely only, and probable, that the old Testament is true, for that it was only supposed, and not proued at the beginning? What can be more ignorantly spoken then this, concerning the comparison of conclusions, and suppositions? Nor can he run out, by saying that he agreed not to my supposall at the beginning, for that there are certaine supposalls so euidēt of themselues, as they require no consent of the aduersary, as were those of Euclide before mentioned: and so was this of mine in the passage of my Letter already cited, where I supposed that I treated of Catholike people only, and acording to Catholike Doctrine, and in matters belonging to Catholicke mens soules, and consciences,
                     
                        Letter pag. 12. num. 20., and not of Protestants: which supposall no man can contradict, for that it is most cleare and euident by my owne wordes,M. Barlow a poore Philosopher and worse Deuine. and therefore consequently M. Barlow hath shewed himselfe but a very poore Philosopher, and a worse Deuine in this place.
                  But the two notorious vntruthes, which he vttereth presently in the next ensuing lynes (though I be weary now of such stuffe) may not be pretermitted. The first is against Cardinall Bellarmine, the second is against the Pope concerning his prohibition of the Oath. His wordes for the first are these.
                        Barlow pag. 30. 
                     If all the rest of the Apostles were not ordered Bishops by S. Peter (saith Bellarmine) then cannot the Church of Rome be Mother of all other Churches (much lesse the Bishop) and whether it were so or no, the best writing Iesuites doe indeed make it but a supposall.
                  
                  But now for the chastisemēt of his folly, for saying but a supposal, as though it were a speach of vncertainty I haue said sufficiēt before. There remaineth his vntruth in saying that Bellar. doth suppose, that if the rest of the Apostles were not made Bishops by S Peter, then cannot the Church of Rome be the Mother-Church of other Churches, nor the Bishop vniuersal Bishop. For first as cōcerning the latter part,

about the Vniuersall Bishop, Bellarmine hath no one word thereof, but teacheth the quite contrary, founding the power, and authority of S. Peter ouer all other Churches, vpon other groundes, and namely vpon the commission of Christ, Matth. 16. &

                     oresayd Authors, about the matter.
                  Now then to come to the second vntruth, that the Pope by decreeing the Oath, as it lay, was vnlawfull, did also forbid euen that very point of s
                           •
                        earing ciuill obedience, which is so notoriously vntrue, as whosoeuer doth but read the Popes Breue it selfe, or Cardinall Bellarmine his explication

therof, or my Letter, wherin the contrary is euery where protested, wil maruaile to see such impudent proceeding. But of this more afterward. Now wee shall passe to discusse, whether there be any pointes in the sayd Oath, concerning the religion, and consciences of Catholicks, whereby the taking thereof was made vnlawfull vnto them. For this doth Maister Barlow vtterly deny, as now you shall heare.

                  hat the swearer is his true loyall subiect, to obey him in all temporall affayres, and other like clauses, whereat no man sticketh, or maketh difficulty; there be other clauses also against the authority of the Supreme Pastour, which doe iustly breed scruple of conscience to a Catholicke to

                  dmit, or take the same.
               Secondly I shewed the same, by the Popes wordes in his Breues, wherin he doth conioyne the taking of this Oath with the going to the Churches, and Seruice of a different Religion, pronouncing the one and the other to be vnlawfull. Thirdly I declared the same out of the iudgment of Cardinall Bellarmine, & other learned men, who hauing considered well the nature of this Oath, and different clauses therin cōtayned, do hold it for so cautelously compounded by artificially ioyning togeather Temporal and Spirituall thinges, to wit Ciuill Obedience, & forswearing the Popes supreme Ecclesiasticall Authority, as no man can thereby prof

                   it is vttered, yet doth it not so much as impugne any of the former foure waies, wherby it was shewed, that diuers points of Catholike religion are touched in the said Oath and impugned therby: so as a Catholike man cannot admit the same without preiudice of his conscience, which these groundes do nothing impugne. But now let vs see how well grounded are these his two groundes impertinently brought in for some shew of answere.
               The first is, that ciuill obedience to a lawfull Prince requireth the subiect to sweare, not onely affirmatiuely, that he is his lawful Soueraigne, but also negatiuely against any intruder, challenger, or vsurper, which we deny not: but do deny that the Pope as supreme Pastour ouer al

                  ction.
               
                  And as for his second ground, that this authority of the Pope is a temporall intrusion,The reasō of the Popes power in tē

                   and no spirituall iurisdiction, we deny it in like sort: for though it be temporall in some respects, yet is it no intrusion, but giuen by Christ himselfe, as contained in the most ample spirituall charge and commission deliuered to S. Peter for gouerning of all soules belonging to the sayd charge, which cannot be sufficiently gouerned and prouided for, if there had not beene such power left also, whereby euill Princes might be restayned from peruerting their Kingdomes, especially by infection of heresy.
               And whereas for proofe of this temporall intrusion, as he calleth it, he saith, that for to doe me a fauour he will remit me to T. M. the elder, to wit to Thomas Morton

               This is M. Barl. his assault, which I haue thought good to set downe at large, both faithfully, and punctually in his owne very words, as my custome is, & not contractedly and perfidiously peruerted, as he euery where vseth to set downe myne, and that in a different letter (as often I am forced to complain) as though they were my wordes indeed. And now to this passage of his I say, that there is much impertinent stuffe, many falsities, sundry great abuses, misapplications, and wrong senses from the Authors owne meaning whom he citeth.

                   For first it was impertinent to cite that sentence of S. Bernard, Nam quod amplius est, à malo est: for that he vseth the same to a far different purpose, as euery man may see, that will read the place in his second booke de Consideratione, which particular quotation Maister Barlow did pretermitt, citing only Bern. ad Eugen. therby to make the finding thereof more hard, S. Bernard hauing written fiue bookes to Eugenius.
               
               
                  Secondly that which he alleageth out of Salmeron that the State of the Iewes,Salmeron abused by M. Mort. M. Barl. &c. 
                  was rather earthly, then heauenly, and therefore the carnall part was more eminent, that is, Kings had the soueraignty ouer Priestes, is notably both peruerted and falsifyed. For first Salmerons wordes (speaking of the Ecclesiasticall gouernment of the Iewes in comparison of that, which was giuen to the Christian Churches) are,
                     Salm. in Epist. Paul. disp. 12. 
                  Synagoga Iudaeorum dicebatur terrenum potiùs quàm caeleste regnum. The Synagogue of the Iewes was called rather an earthly, then a heauenly kingdome: meaning that their Power was but earthly, their Sacrifices earthly, their promises and blessinges earthly, in respect of the heauenly and spirituall power, Sacramentes, Sacrifice, and Promises of the new Testament. Nor doth he make comparison betweene the Kings power, and the power of Priestes, calling the former earthly and carnall, & the other heauenly, as most falsely & seditiously M. Barlow here, after M. Morton, doth auer: but only the Ecclesiasticall authority of the Iewes Synagogue, with the excellent spirituall power of the Christian Church. And as for the comparison betweene kingly, & Priestly eminency amongst the Iewes, the said Salmeron in the same place, doth not only affirme, but proueth also by sundry arguments, and one, by the worthines of the Sacrifice offered in the first place for the Priest before the King: that Priestly dignity, was aboue Princely in that people, and much more amongst the Christians. So as here is notorious falshood on M. Barlowes behalfe,Malicious falshood in M. Barlow. which is much the more malicious, and intolerable in him, for that he had seene me to haue obiected the same falsehood, and vntrue dealing vnto M. Morton in my booke of Mitigation:
                     Mitigatiō pag. 101. & that the sayd M. Morton was so farre of from being able to answer the same, as in his last Reply he left it quite out: & now lately I haue obiected the

Sanders doth hold the quite contrary in that booke throughout sundry Chapters, to wit, that the Pope hath receaued from Christ vtrumque gladium, temporalem & spiritualem, both swords, that is, both temporall and spirituall authority, and proueth it by many arguments, and demonstrations: only in the 13. Chapter he demandeth, why thē had not the Apostoles depriued Nero and Domitius of their Empires?

Chapter, he demandeth further, why the Apostles, & first Christians had not elected some new King Christan for the good of the Church at the beginning? Whereto he answereth, alleaging sundry reasons, why it was not conuenient, that the Christian Church should be planted with violence, but that for the space, and time appointed by Gods prouidence Christians should exercise the other part of Christiā fortitude which cōsisteth in suffering, as is before touched

                  n my Histories both diuine, & Ecclesiasticall; and it had bene good, that M. Barlow had answered to some of them, if he had thought him selfe able to meddle in this matter; or at leastwise he ought not to haue so fraudulently cited Card. Bellarmine against his owne meaning, as now you haue seene.
               But now next after Scriptures M. Barlow commeth

to Ecclesiastical law, requiring to haue this power proued by Canons, Councells, Decrees, and Practises, for which I referre him to the Booke, & Chapters now cited in Bellarmine. And for so much as this temporall power of S. Peter, is founded vpon his spirituall commission as a thing necessarily following the same, and needfull therunto, for the perfect gouerment of the whole Church, & that this spirituall power is founded most euidently & aboundantly in the new Testament, and consent of all antiquity vpon the same, as the sayd Cardinall doth proue, and demonstrate throughout many Chapters of his first, and second Bookes De Romano Pontifice, I will weary the Reader no longer in this matter, but remit him thither, I meane to the foresaid Cardinall Bellarmine, where he shall find store of proofes for both powers in the Pope, I meane both spirituall and temporall, though differently deriued vnto him, the one immediatly and directly, the other secondarily and indirectly.
               And albeit this were sufficient for this point, yet to the end that M. Barlow shall not say, that I doe leaue out any thing of momēt, which herein he setteth down

                   I answer that if this were so, and that it could be proued, that this temporall power of the Pope as we teach it, were but a humane inuention indeed, and not founded in any authority diuine, or humane; then M. Barlow had sayd somewhat to the matter, and the comparison of an Oath taken against any other tēporal Prince might haue place. But for that we haue shewed now, that this is not 
                     〈◊〉
                  , but that there is great difference betweene this temporall power of the Pope deriued from his supreme spirituall authority, as vniuersall Pastour (which no temporall Prince is) and the pretension of any meere temporall Potentate; therfore is the swearing against the one, but a ciuil obedience, and the other a point belonging to conscience, and religion, with those that belieue the sayd power to come from God.

Barlow. For though Sigebert following somewhat the faction of the Emperour Henry the third, excommunicated by Pope Vrbanus the second, did often speake partially concerning the actions, that passed betweene them, which many tymes seemed to proceed of passion, more then of reason and iustice: yet doth he neuer deny such power of Excommunicating, & deposing for iust causes to belawfull in the Pope, but the playne contrary.

                  urther into other bookes of his, I find the wordes, which is a token that our Doctor writeth out of note-bookes of some Brother, and neuer seeth the places himselfe: but though I find the wordes, yet not the sense which he will inferre, but wholy peruerted to another meaning. For that if S. Ambrose had bene of opiniō, that Kinges and Emperours had bene so priuiledged by the power of their Empire, a

                   Dauid was a King, and thereby was not vnder lawes for that Kinges are free from the bandes of their offences, for that they are not called to punishment by lawes, being safe by the power of their Empire.
               So S. Ambrose. Wereby is seene, that he vnderstandeth, that Princes commonly are not subiect to humane lawes, for that they will not, nor may be called to accompt for their offences, as priuate mē are, being free by their pow

Barlow in this place, for the Protestants, calling him our owne Writer. And for the Catholikes, Cardinall Bellarmine hath lately written a most learned booke against him by name, confuting his priuat fancy, by the publique authority, weight and testimonies of all Catholike Deuines. And so much for this.
               
                  
                  OF CERTAINE NOTORIOVS Calumniations vsed by M. Barlow against his aduersary, which no wayes can be excused from malice, & witting errour. §. II.
                  AS the former fraud discouered and conuinced against M. Barlow, of abusing authors against their owne wordes and meaning, is a foule fault and very shā
                     full in him that pretendeth to haue conscience or care of his credit: so is the crime of apparēt and willfull Calumniation, bearing no shew of truth or reason at all, much more foolish & wicked. Foolish, for that it doth wholy discredit the Calumniator with his Readers: wicked, for that it sheweth plaine malice, and will to hurt,

Barlow finding himselfe much pressed and strained with the reasonable and moderate speach which I vsed in my Epistle throughout three numbers togeather, concerning the Oath freely taken (as was said by many Catholikes, both Priests and Laicks expounding their taking of the Oath in a good sense) he doth so malignantly peruert the same, by open calumniatiōs, as euery child may discouer, not only the falshood, but the fury also of his passion against me, nothing being in his answere but exorbitant rayling, & apparent lying.
                  For whereas I in reason deserued rather approbation, and commendation from him, for expounding plainly and sincerely that meaning which those Catholikes, (if they were Catholikes) had, or could haue in their taking of the Oath, without all Equiuocation or mentall reseruation, which I condemned in an Oath, as altogeather vnlawfull concerning any point of religion, that ought to be confessed; he not being able to abide the light of this truth, and plaine dealing, falleth into a certaine frenzy of rayling

You haue heard before how wisely he defended a certain definition which he gaue of an Oath: now you shall see him as wisely & learnedly defend an inseparable propriety or marke of an hypocrite. And first you see that here is no distinction or limitation at all, whether he iudg well or ill, with cause or without cause, rashly or maturely, how then if wee should heare a man or woman speake ordinarily lewd wordes, can no iudgement be made of the speakers consciences without hypocrisie? If a man should see another frequēt bad howses, or exercise wicked actions, may no man iudge him to haue an ill conscience, from whence these things doe proceed, but he must be

For if it do not agree to all, and euer, it is not inseparable: and if it agree to others besides hypocrites, it is not alwaies the marke of an hypocrite: and therefore albeit that I had iudged their consciences, as M. Barlow imposeth vpon me, he could not by good consequēce haue inferred, that I was an hypocrite.

And are not these distinctions needfull in this affaire? Do they not cleare the doubt in controuersy? Do they not remoue confusion? Would M.

                     e I should blush & acknowledge my ouersight, if they were truly related, but being falsely eyther of malice or ignorance collected by him, he ought to blush, and be sory for his sin. For as I doe confesse the former part numb. 14. that I allowed not any sort of Equiuocation in matters concerning faith and Religion: so doe I vtterly deny the later clause num. 30. that I doe allow Equiuocation in this particuler fact of taking the Oath. Let the places be read in my booke & thereby he will remayne conuinced. For I do say expresly that these two clauses of explication added by me, that the Popes power in deposing Princes is indirectly, & with iust cause, must both be expressed by the swearer, and accepted by the Magistrate, and then are they no Equiuocations at all; but direct assertions. For that they are no mentall reseruations wherein consisteth the nature and force of Equiuocation.
                  Here then M. Barlow that accused me a litle before of making no conscience of God or common honesty, must looke how he will defend his owne, eyther conscience or honesty (if he haue any) in this foule calumniation, wherein I doe not see what tergiuersation he can vse for his excuse. And so I would leaue him in this matter, if he did not continue on his rayling and raging beyond all measure, as though by this my explication & distinction vsed, I had committed the greatest crime in the world.

                     Aristotle abused by M. Barl. And albeit M. Barlow do bouldly and ignorantly say that the word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , which by all Interpreters doth signifie peierare, to periure, or forsweare, doth import also to sweare with mental addition: yet is this only a fiction of his, nor can he bring forth one example out of Aristotle or any Greeke writer which doth vse it in that sense, nor could Aristotle vse it so in this place, where he vseth the sayd wordes thrice in these lines by me alleaged alwaies for peierare, to forsweare, and neuer for doubting or mentall addition. Nay it cannot stand with any sense of Aristotles discourse, for if Aristotle should say, that no man truly will doubt in his Oath, or haue a mētall reseruation both for feare of Gods chastisement, & discredit amongst men, it were a ridiculous speach: for that men do not knowe when a mentall reseruation is made, or when a man doubteth in his Oath, but when he forsweareth himselfe it may come to be knowne. And in like manner it is more ridiculous, to say against the aduersary, as Aristotle teacheth vs, that he which sticketh not to doe wickedly, will not sticke to doubt also in his Oath, or to vse a mentall addition, which no man I

               THE REASON IS EXAMINED WHETHER GODS PROVIDENCE MIGHT SEEME DEFECTVOVS, if no authority had bene left in the Christian hurch to restraine and punish euill Kings. AND Whether God be so wary in dealing with Kings, as M. Barlow maketh him. CHAP. III.
               I SAID in my former Letter, as in the precedent Chapter hath bene seene, that I could not perswade my self, that such Catholikes as were sayd to haue accepted the Oath, did meane to abiure al authority of the Pope for depo

                     Barl. p. 41.To this my speach M. Barlow answereth thus: If by Catholike Deuines he meaneth Scriptures, Councells, Fathers, Stories, for a thousand yeares after Christ, the Reader must take it for a mendacious vanity, and let it passe for no better. Wherto I reply, that as I do meane it, it is no mendacious vanity, but a religio

                   verity, for that I meane by Catholike Deuines in this place, all such of that profession as haue handled the question particularly of this temporall Authority of the Pope in certaine vrgent occasions, which are principally Scholasticall Deuines, especially those of this age, that haue written against all sorts of Heretikes that denied the same. And albeit M. Barlow in his rayling vayne, do challenge the Schoole-men,The learning and sincerity of School-men. as blasphemously detorting Scriptures; yet he that shall read them with iudgment and attention, without this furious passion of hatred against them, and lacke of capacity to vnderstand them, shall quickly perceiue that their skill in Scriptures, Councels, Fathers, & Stories is far superiour by infinite degrees to that of M. Barlow, and his Mates, that crake so much against them, and their sincerity in expounding them according to their true meaning; and is also without comparison more sound, as may appeare by the many grosse and wilfull corruptions, which I haue noted in him before in that kind.
               
                  Excōmunicatiō of Princes practised in the Primitiue Church.And albeit in some hundreds of yeares after Christ, there had not occurred any such particular occasion of actuall deposing of temporall Princes, as did afterwards, wherof wee haue treated before, for that Princes were not so exorbitant: yet the ground and origen of deposing Princes, which is excommunication and exclusion from the body of the Church, cannot be denied to haue byn practised often in those former ages. And when a temporall Prince is so cast out of the Church by excommunication,

& made no member therof (& much lesse may he be Head) if he perseuere obstinate, and seeke to infect, and destroy the whole body; I say in this case what shall the sayd Church and Gouernours therof doe with such a Prince? Wherin I sayd that all Catholike Deuines doe agree, that our Sauiour in this case hath not left his Church vnprouided of some remedy, for that otherwise his diuine prouidence might seeme to haue bene defectuous, not to haue left a remedy for so great and vniuersall an euill.
               But now at this reason, as strongly pressing him, M. Barlow stormeth and stampeth exceedingly, saying, first it is a tryuiall obiection borrowed by me from Cardinall Allens Apology,
                     Pag. 42. and by vs both from one Bertrand that vseth the same in his glosse vpon a place of the Canon law. But what if all this were true, as it is not?M. Barlowes meriment of the moon in the Asse

But this shall appeare presently by the discussion that is to ensue & thereby also will appeare what spirit speaketh in this Minister, to wit the most base and abiect spirit of prophane fl

God neuer thought it fit to support his Church, by daring of Princes, prosessors of his name; for that had bene the way to haue made them not nourishing Fathers, but eyther pinching suppressours, or at least cold and wary sauourers of the same.
               
               Thus far M. Barlow, to shew that Almighty God dealeth more warily and respectiuely with temporall Princes, thē doth the Pope, which threatneth them losse of their Kingdomes if they be incorrigible: and to this effect abuseth pittifully this Psalme here alledged, as presently we shall shew. But first I would demaund of him, why he bringeth in that iealousy of Princes concerning their thrones, and that Mate for diuision, or Check-mate for scorne? Doth he allow of these iealousies as proceeding from sanctity? Doth he commend that fact of Salomon for making away his brother

                  Adoniah, for asking only Abishag to be his wife? Sure I am, that diuers ancient Fathers do condemne the same,Salomons fact of killing Adoniah condemned. & a learned interpreter of this age, sayth: Excuset qui scit, mihi 
                        〈◊〉

                     a Salomonis excusatio &c. Let him defend Salomon that knoweth how to do it, for vnto me no lawfull excuse of Salomons fact occurreth, for that the sentence of death seemeth to me not only seuere, but also vniust. So he. Now as for the iealousie of Pilate wherby he made away our Sauiour, I suppose M.Barlow will not be so shamelesse as to commend the same, except Pilate were aliue againe, and he his Chaplaine, for then perhaps the matter were doubtfull.
               But wherto now doth all this Preface pertaine, of Princes iealousies? The matter is cleare, that it tendeth to shew what great reason God hath to walke warily, least he offend Kings and Princes. For so it followeth imediately in that point. Therefore (and marke the inference therefore) we shall see God himselfe to be very wary. But wherof M. Barlow? Is he so wary of not putting Kings and Princes in feare & iealousie of their thrones as you call them? Why is God afrayd of them? For that your (therefore) would seeme to infer. Or is his throne lesse or more weake thē theirs? How then is it ascribed vnto him as a peculiar property, Deposuit Potentes de sede, & exaltauit hu

How is it sayd of him, Qui aufert spiritum Principum, & est terribilis Regibus terrae, who taketh away the spirit of Princes, and is terrible to the Kings of the earth? And yet further qui balteum Regum dissoluit, & pracingit fune renes eorum,

                        ••
                     , doe you apprehend or admit the discipline, and doctrine of the Sonne of God when he shall appeare in flesh, and so do all the ancient Greeke and Latin Fathers interprete this passage of the Psalme: nor can I see with what shew of reason or probability M. Barlow can bring it for his purpose of flattering Kings in this place: he saith, that God concludeth not here, with a menacing extrusion (of Kinges) but with a calme persuasion, Kisse the sonne: this kissing seemes perhaps to him an amiable thing: but if it be interpreted, as now I haue shewed, and S. Hierome doth expound it, for a matter of subiection, humiliation, and of admitting

discipline, it seemeth not oftentimes so sweet & pleasant to Princes, as M. Barlow would haue it.
               But what shall we say to other phrases here contayned, as whē Kings & Princes do swell, & take counsaile against God and his Christ, saying: Let vs breake their bands and cast of their yoake, then sayth the Prophet: He that sitteth in heauen will scorne them, and our Lord will scoffe at them. Then will he speake vnto them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury. A little after he sayth, That, he shall rule them with an iron-rod, and shall breake thē in pieces like a potters vessell.
                  The secōd psalme ill chosen of M. Barlow for flattery of Princes. And now M. Barlow, is this a calme perswasiō? is here no menacing extrusion threatned to Princes whē they are threatned to be crushed like a potters vessell? Nay marke also the subsequēt perswasiō, Nunc ergo Reges intelligite &c. Now therfore vnderstād, ô ye Kings, & be wise: Learne how to iudg the earth. Serue god in feare, and reioyce in him with trembling. Admit discipline least he wax angry, and you perish frō your way (for so hath the Hebrue text:) whē his wrath shalbe but a little kindled, happy are all those that trust in him. What can be spoken more seuerely to Princes then all this? Or was this Psalme well chosen by M. Barlow for his purpose of flattering Kinges and Princes, in respect of Gods warynes in his speaches? Whereas no Psalme amongst all the rest vttereth so much terror vnto them, only the words osculemini Filium do seeme to haue drawne him to this impertinent imagination.
               But now let vs see his Conclusion, and application against the Popes pretending authority ouer Kinges, for which all the rest hitherto hath bene brought in, Ne pereatis de via iusta: least you loose the right way to heauen, and your right in the crowne of heauen: he sayd not, your titles to your Kingdomes, nor right to your Crownes vpon earth: God thought it neuer fit to support his Church by daring of Princes, Professors of his name. A Godly speach, & fitting for soe spirituall a man, as this Doctour seemeth to bee, if for refusing discipline and obedience God doth threaten to Princes the losse of heauen, with all the right they haue to that euerlasting Crowne and Kingdome, which includeth also their eternall condemnation to hell-fire and torments! What great priuiledge is it to spare their titles to their temporall crownes & kingdomes

on earth, that may be lost in an instant, and long cannot indure, why should God thinke it so inconuenient to support his Church by daring of Princes, least perhaps they should wax angry, and dare him againe? For so it seemeth by the reason giuen heere, least by daring they should not be nourishing Fathers to the sayd Church, but eyther pinchi
                        •
                     g suppressors, or cold sauourers. And why? For that God dareth them forsooth with leesing their temporall states. His daring for leesing of heauen seemeth not to trouble them so much, but their perill to loose their temporall kingdome, if they be incorrigible, is the thing that principally troubleth them, according to this wise discourse of M. Barlow. Doe not his friends take pitty of his folly? If I would take vpon me to lay forth the examples that are found in Scriptures of Gods plaine speaches, & menacing threates vnto Princes (let M. Barlow call them darings if he will) it would quickly appeare how vaine, and prophane the former obseruation of his is, that God is so very wary in his speaches towards them.
               For what will you say to that speach of his to King Sennacherib: Ponam circulum in naribus tuis, & camum in labijs t

And this is Gods plaine speach, and plaine dealing, for that Princes to him are no more then poore men, all flesh and dust: albeit whilst they liue vpon earth, & beare rule in his place, he will haue them respected, obeyed, and honoured, as his Deputies in all that they shall command, not contrary to his lawes, which he will haue obserued both by Prince and people; and detesteth all such prophane flattery as heere we haue heard vttered by M. Barlow. And so much for this matter.
               Now then to come to my former proposition, that the Prouidence of God might seeme to be defectuous, if his diuine Maiestie had left no remedy for so great an euill: it is founded vpon all those places of Scripture, where it is sayd that Gods workes are perfect, as Deuter. 32. and that they are made in wisedome, Psalme 103. vers. 24. that is to say, in most high wisedome, & ordinata sunt, saith S. Paul, Rom. 13. they are according to order & well ordered, & the like. Out of all which is inferred, that whatsoeuer the perfection of wisdom, & good order doth or can prescribe in any worke, that is to be presumed to be in Gods works, yea with far higher perfection then mans wisedome can reach vnto. Whereby it followeth, that as when a prudent humane Law giuer instituteth a Commō-wealth, he prouideth for all inconueniences, that by humane probability may fall out vnto the same: so much more Christ our Sauiour, being not only man, but also God, must be presumed to haue prouided sufficiently and aboundantly for his Kingdome, and Common-wealth which is the Christian Church, purchased with his owne bloud, for preuention of all hurtes and euills imminent to the same;

which seemeth had not bene done, if he had left this gre

                  e cōmonly in this particuler, for the defensiue part; and much lesse may it be thought, that Christ our Sauiour would be wanting in so important a point. Neyther is this any way blasphemous or disgracefull to our Sauiours infinite wisdome and prouidence, as M. Barlow would most impertinently seeme to vrge, but highly rather to his honour: for somuch, as wee professe that he hath prouided for this euill, and the Protestants hold that he hath not.
               For as, when a man beholdeth a house made by some excellent Architect, and considereth all the partes & commodities thereof, with prouision for all vses, and prouidence for all cases that may fall out, he admireth the coherence & dependance of one thing vpon another, prayseth and extolleth the wisedome and foresight of the Author, saying: If this or that had not bene foreseene, and prouided for, as excellently it was, it had byn a great want and defect, but being prouided for, it doth infinitly commēd his sayd care, wisedome, foresight, and prouidence. And euen soe in our case, when a man considereth the admirable excellency of Christ our Sauiours wisedome, in other pointes concerning the gouerment of his Church, how carefully and orderly he hath prouided for the same, in all necessary points, as in part the holy Apostle doth describe both to the Corinthians, and Ephesians, appointing some Apostles, some Prophetes, some Euangelists, some Doctors, some Pastours, ad consummationem Sanctorum, in op
                        •
                     s ministerij, in aedificationem Corporis Christi, for the consummation of the Sayntes, and for the works of the ministery, & for the building vp the body of Christ, which is his Church, with exact order, prouidence and subordinatiō of things, men, and offices, one to another, with sufficient power and authority for euery party to doe his office:

these things, I say, being well considered, do inferre that it cannot possibly stand with such high wisedome & prouidence of our Sauiour, to leaue his sayd body and Church vnprouided of sufficient authority, to preuent, or remedie so mayne a calamitie, as might fall vpon the sayd Church by temporall Christian Princes, if there were no restraint or punishment for them.
               Nor do the Protestants themselues pretermit to vse such kind of arguments, and consequences for their owne defence, when they deale with domesticall Aduersaries, to wit, with Protestants of other Sects. As for example, when the Puritan refuseth all Bishops, Archbishops, and other distinction of subordination in the Clergy: what vrgeth in effect the Protestant on the other side, but that it belonged to Christ his diuine prouidence to leaue such distinction and subordination: and consequently that it might be noted for defectuous, if he had left but the Puritan parity in all?
               The like passeth with the Lutheran, who denying the temporall Prince to be Head of the Church, and confesseth consequently that their Church is headlesse vpon earth, but only dependeth on Iesus Christ, as head in heauen; is refuted by the English Caluinists with the same argument of the defect of Gods prouidence, if he had not prouided some Head on earth also. And much more holdeth this argument against the Anabaptists, who hold that Christ hath left no temporall power or Magistrate in his Church, to iudge or condemne, and especially to death, for any cause whatsoeuer, for that he sayth, nolite i

but if his diuine Maiesty hauing prouided most sufficiently for all other inconueniences, it would haue bene a note of defect in the same, not to haue prouided for this case of extreme necessity, in some occurrents, which we say he hath done, by leauing sufficient authority in S. Peter

               The first is of Aluarus Pelagius, an ancient Canonist, saith he,
                     Alu. Pelag. lib. 1. De planctu Eccl. cap. 13. of their owne, who talking of the Mathematicall donation of Constantine, saith, Palea est, at Ecclesia pro gran

                  Aluarus Pelagius abused by M. Barl.
                   no lesse thē commonly are other Authours by him cyted, with a guilty conscience, for that he well knew, that Aluarus doth not hold that Donation to be chaffe, but doth approue the same to be true in diuers places of his workes, as namely, lib. 1. cap. 43. & lib. 2. cap. 29. and elswhere, which M. Barlow could not choose but know, by Aluarus his owne words, and wh

Gregory the first,
                     Greg. c. 10. ad interrogata Augustini. Beda lib. 1. de hist. Angl. cap. 27. written vnto S. Augustine our Apostle, and recorded by Venerable Bede: so that the meaning of Aluarus was, that albeit this donation of Constantine was recorded by Gratian vnder the title of Palea, yet the Church doth hold it for corne, that is to say, for a matter of truth, about which I remit me to those Authors, that did write of that affaire lōg before Gratian, as Petrus Damianus accompted for a most holy & learned man before the Conquest, Iuo Carnotēsis, & others. So as here the vntruth of M. Barlow, alledging of Aluarus against his owne meaning, is euident, that he intended therby to deceiue his Reader.

               This is his first resolution about Catholicke consciences, which if he knew what a true conscience meaneth, and what is truly Catholick, he would neuer say as he doth: but for that it seemeth he is as far from feeling in the one, as from knowledge in the other, he talketh at randome, he knoweth not what against feare, and bringeth in Idolatry and superstition as causes of feare, which haue no more coherence with the matter in hand,Idolatry and superstition not alwaies causes of f

For we say, that when Catholick men are forced by penall lawes to sweare against their owne consciences, that is to say, against the dictamen of their owne reason and iudgement, which they haue in matter of Religion, their griefe must needes be excessiue, there being vndique angustiae, for that on the one side if they swear, their owne consciences will condemne them: and if they

sweare not, they of

                  end their Prince, and incur most grieuous penaltyes of the law. VVhat sayth our Doctour to this dilemma? He telleth vs a tale, how that Idolatry is mixed with superstition neuer voyd of feare. VVhat is this to the purpose? We talke not now of feare which may be both good and bad, and the former is highly commended in Scripture: and we are commaunded to worke our saluation with feare and trembling: but this is not now to our purpose, nor will I examine M. Doctour why he ascribeth fear so particularly to superstition, as that it is neuer voyd thereof, for that superstition being an excesse in religion, maketh commonly the superstitious person to be more confident, and lesse fearefull then any other men; & this likewise ouerthroweth that foolish clause put in by M. Barlow, that superstition wisheth there were no Gods: for that her nature consisting in excesse of supposed religion, as h
                     •
                  th bene sayd, she cannot wish that there were no Gods, but leaueth this rather to Atheisme her contradictour; which as it belieueth no Gods, nor careth for thē, so would it wish that there were none. But superstition standing, on the contrary, vpon disordinate, excessiue & erroneous seruing of God, is absurdely sayd heere to wish there were no Gods at all.

                  But according to the iudgement and writing of these two Fathers, concerning the nature and property of heresy, and heretickes, M. Barlowes religion (if it be the Protestants) is conuinced to be heresy, and the professors thereof heretickes. Ergo, also they are Idolatours, and of the basest kinde of Idolatours, and damnably worship the fancies of their owne braynes.
               This Syllogisme, consisting of M. Barl. his maior, & my minor, & the conclusion following of them both, I could wish he would cōsider wel. And for so much as I know he wil deny the minor,

               The other Authour S. Augustine is far more large and difficult to be studied throughly, in respect of the multitude of his workes, but there is a collection made of them into foure bookes by a learned man of our time, with the title of Confessio Augustiniana: wherin is gathered the iudgement of S. Augustine about all the controuersies of our time, which he hath handled in his workes so many hundred yeares agoe, before the new names of Protestants or Papists were euer heard of; and to the diligent reading of this Booke I would exhort all indifferent men that haue care of their soules, and vnderstand the latin tongue. For that S. Augustine being the man he was, both in learning, and sanctity, and so speciall a Pillar of Christ his Church in his dayes, which was about foure hundred yeares after Christ, when yet the true Catholike Church is granted to haue flourished; it followeth, that what doctrine he held for true, and Catholike in his time, must also be now: & what held to be heresy, we may also boldly hold the same:

If you aske him further how he knoweth it is reuealed by God; he will say it is conteined in his word, eyther written or vnwritten, or both. Yf you aske him againe, how he knoweth it is cōteined in Gods word, in that sense that he defends it; he will answere, for that the knowne Catholike Church doth tell him so, by whose authority he is taught what is Gods word, and how it is to be vnderstood. And if you demand of him further, how he knoweth the Church to haue such authority, and the Roman Church to be the Catholike Church; he will alledg for the former diuers Scriptures, acknowledged also by the opposite

Sectaries, as that before mentioned, wherin she is called, The pillar and stay of truth: and for the second, he will alledge so many demonstrations, of the beginning, growth, increase, continuance, succession, and visible de

                     cks. they will all answere conformably for the first step, that they doe build vpon the word of God, yea the writtē word only. But if you go a step further, & demand of them, how they know that this written word is well vnderstood by them, for so much as they are of fiue different Religions, founded by them all vpon the same written word: here now they cannot passe any further to the foresaid Catholike Church for finall resolutiō, as the first did, for that they all do impugne her, but ech man must defend his different interpretation of that written word, by his owne iudgement, or els by the iudgement of his owne Congregation and Sect, which in effect is the same. So as these fiue learned men do remaine irreconciliable as you see, for want of a ground from whence to take their vltima resolutio, and do shew themselues according to the former speaches of Vincentius, and S. Austine both Heretikes and Idolatours, in that, following the

                  ule, & resolution of their owne heads, they adore as many Gods, as they haue selfe-conceipts for ground of their fayth. And will you say that this poynt of vltima resolutio was wisely brought in by M. Barlow, being a thing wherby himselfe and his are condemned to haue no last resolution, or certayne ground at all for their beliefe, but only their owne 
                     •
                  eads? But oh (sayth he) you depend for resolution vpon

the Pope, which is so vncertaine, as what one Pope decrees another disallowes. But I haue now answered, that we depend vpon the Catholicke Church,What resolution is taken frō the Pope. as propounding vnto vs and expounding Gods word, and we depend of the Supreme Pastour as head of that Church, vnto whō we rest assured by Gods owne word and promise, that he will assist him with his spirit for all resolutions in matters of fayth, which shalbe necessary for his sayd Church: nor can M. Barlow prooue that what one Pope decrees in these matters of fayth, another disallowes. One of them may well alter matters of policy, gouernment, Ceremonies, or the like; but for poynts of fayth we do allow M. Barlow sixteene hundred yeares to seeke them out. And if in so long time he could haue produced but one true example, I suppose we should haue had it.
               I doe willingly pretermit a great deale more of idle & impertinent speach which M. Barlow vseth about this matter of Catholiks Consciences, 
                     •
                  hewing indeed to haue little himselfe, nor yet to know well what it meaneth, and much lesse speaketh he to the present purpose.
For he telleth vs first, that if pressure of conscience may serue for good Plea of Recusancy to Princes lawes, there is neyther malefactor for crime, nor hereticke for schisme, but that will make that his Apology. Wherunto I answere, that causes, persons, merits, and demerits are to bee distinguished in this matter, and not to be confounded.
For what hath the malefactour for crime, or hereticke for schisme to doe in this affaire? From the first I thinke the aduersaries themselues will deliuer them, or at leastwise theyr neyghbors, among whome they dwell: and as for the second of heresy and schisme, we haue spoken now already sufficiently, to shew where those imputations may, and must lye, & not vpon the Catholickes, who are opposite to that charge.
               Secondly,
                     Pag. 53. then he telleth vs,
that we lacke the light within vs, which should driue away the darkenesse of our consciences, and purge the eye therof from mist, dust, & lime. And vpon this he maketh vs an exhortation, that we

take heed of Caligo tenebrarum in this life, that dusketh the eies of our vnderstanding to perdition, especially by worldly delightes, desire of honour, and wealth, this being puluis pigmentarius, sayth he, the Merchants dust, which tickleth the eies, and blindeth the sight of the wisest, as do also enuy by emulation, preiudice of affection, wilfulnes by opposition, which like vnto lyme tormenteth the eye, and peruerteth the iudgement &c.
And is not this, a very graue,M. Barlows hate of ambition, scilicet, and his mortification. and serious exhortation, comming from such a man as he is, knowne to be so clearely inlightned, as neyther mist, nor dust, nor lyme of ambition can sticke vpon a man so hating worldly delights, honour, and wealth, as no part of this merchants dust can tickle his eyes? Are not his mortifications knowne? His contempt of the world seene by his life, and conuersation? Is not his hate of ambition, honour, and wealth discouered by his voluntary pouerty? aboundance of almes? refusall of dignities, & temporall commodities? Let his Parishioners testify for him.
               But yet against vs he goeth forward, telling vs, that the Iewes veyle is spread ouer our harts, and consciences, and that by our owne wilfulnes, errour, and peeuishnes. Item, to a corrupt stomake, yea the lightest meats are troublesome, but cleansed, it will easily concoct, and orderly digest the strongest food &c.
Which last direction of cleā
                  sing the stomake, to be able to concoct, and put ouer the strongest foode, being applied as M. Barlow applieth it, to the purging of a mans conscience from feare, therby not to haue scruple, commeth very euill from his mouth,M. Barlows stomake for digestion and concoction. who as they write from thence, is held to haue so purged a conscience from all due feare of offending God, by doing, saying, or swearing any thing, which to the state or present Prince may be gratefull, that already as I vnderstand the commonvoyce hath bene of him, as of D. Shaw who in his Sermon betrayed his Lord & Maisters Children, & whole Succession: as this man, I say, in a like publike speach betrayed his dearest Patrones honour, fame & credit. Wherfore he may talke of corrupted stomakes what he pleas

                  : he may also talke of strong digestions; no mans I thinke of

his order, though many be bad, is knowne to be more corrupt then his owne. As for Catholikes, if in this poynt they

                  ad corrupt stomakes, they would neuer stand so much as they do, and with so great losses vpon the contrary: but would rather cleanse their stomakes of all feare & make that strong digestion, which here M. Barlow doth insinuate vnto them, of putting ouer without scruple whatsoeuer is offered to be sayd, long, or sworne, so it be plausible or commodious.
               But now after all this, he maketh his conclusion; and the best comfort that he can giue to Catholickes is this: For them, sayth he, who are to take the Oath, if they refuse it, the penalty is before them, their conscience is free. But now what freedome this is, wee haue discussed before, both out of Philosophy, and Deuinity, and M. Barlow hath bene shewed to vnderstand rightly neyther of them concerning this point, but to haue shewed himselfe ridiculous in both: But let vs heare yet what threat he addeth further of his owne to the former wordes.
                     Barl. p. 54. 
                  The penalty, sayth he, is before them, their conscience is free, but his Maiestie no doubt will beware of them, and the State obserue them, as branded by the Apostle, seduced by the error of Balaams wages, and perishing in the contradiction of Corah and Dathan. Here be wordes of great malice as you see, but of small reason, coherence, or consequence. For first why is there no doubt, but that his Maiestie will beware of them, if they pay the penalty of the Statute, for not sw

Why should not wee thinke rather that his Maiestie will esteeme of them as of men that haue care of their consciences, and consequently that being true to God wilbe also true to him, as Gods Substitute?
               We know that one of his Maiesties most noble Ancestors, yea Constantius, Constantine the great his Father, did make that argument and consequence, when he proposed some like Oath to his Courtiers, that might preiudice his Christian Religion, the swearers he reiected, the refusers he imbraced, as more faithfull then the other: and

why may it not be hoped that his Maiestie out of his great wisedome, and clemency will doe the same? And why should these men be sayed here to be brāded by the Apostle, sed

Wherin hath the Apostle branded them? What hope of gayne, what corruption of money, what wages of Balaam hath seduced thē, that suffer themselues to be so much spoyled & impouerished for not swearing against their owne Consciences?

                  THIS hauing byn spoken principally in the behalfe of those that were pressed with the Oath: there remayneth now the other member, concerning the Exhibitours, or those that vrge it, about which my former speach in my Letter to my friend was this.

or to his Maiesties seruice, which herein they would pretend to aduance. For if there be any cause of doubt of loyall good will in thē, that are forced to sweare against their consciences: much more cause and reason may there be of like doubt, after they haue so sworne, then before. For that the griefe of their new wound of conscience remayning still within them, & stirring them to more auersion of hart, for the iniurie receiued, must needes worke contrary effects to that which is pretended. And whosoeuer will not stick to sweare against his conscience for feare, fauour, or some other like passion, may be presumed that he will as easily breake his oath, after he hath sworne vpon like motiues, if occasion doe mooue him. And among all other passions, none is more strong t

Nothing then is gayned in this behalfe of loyall good will, by such extreme pressures, but much rather lost.

be seuerely punished in the life to come. For that scandalizing properly is nothing els, but laying a stūbling blocke for other men to fall and breake their neckes: and such a one is this formall Oath, which containeth diuers things lawfull for a Catholick to sweare, & other things vnlawful, and he is forced by terrour to passe ouer, and swallow downe one with another without distinction, with manifest repugnance of his conscience, which repugnance to him is alwaies a sinne, and damnable in such a publike and waighty action, though the matter were lawfull in it selfe: and consequently also vnto them that forced him to the same, either knowing or suspecting his said repugnance of conscience. For he that should force a Iew, or a Turke to sweare that there were a blessed Trinity, either knowing or suspecting that they would do it against their cōscience, should sinne grieuously by forcing them to commit that sinne. This is Catholick Doctrine, which I also think the learned Protestants themselues will not deny.
                  
                  Vnto this speach of mine M. Barlow answereth, first granting that a man should rather endure any losse, of life, or goods, then sweare against his conscience: which doctrine I am glad, that in this present case the force of truth hath drawne from him. But he goeth further treating of this poynt of scandall, after such a fashion, out of our Schoole-Doctours, as he marreth all againe.M. Barlowes ill fortune in dealing with Schol men. And truly he hath so euill lucke in dealing with them (not vnderstanding as it seemeth what they meane) as I meruaile that he would euer name them. For though in this place he alleadg only S. Thomas by the name of Aquinas in the margent without quoting where, in what part, or place of his Workes it is to be found; yet doth he peruert his meaning egregiously, going forward, and backward, and taking one thing for another, that it is both pittifull, & ridiculous to consider. But I shall cyte his owne words as they lye, and thereby shall we see how able a Schoole-man he is.
                  
                     But in this point of scandall (sayth he) will this great Deuine vouchsafe to learne a lesson from their owne Schoole-man.

So that here is a scandall actiue without a passiue, and scandall giuen, but not taken.
                  And the like example may be giuen of facts. As if a man should see M. Barlow to eate flesh and feed freely, on fasting dayes, and in the lent, which perhaps were not hard to find him doing, here is a scandall giuen, but it is not necessary that euery one that seeth him doe this, should fall, and follow his fact, and so take the scandall. For many will say to themselues, that M. Barlow followeth not the life of S. Antony, or S. Hilarion, & other Saints that were great fasters,Carnal Diuinity. but a good fellowes life, that loueth a good morsell when he hath it, making no difference of dayes or me

And that passiue scandall is, when any man is induced and falleth into sinne by another mans speach or act, and this eyther with ground or without it, as pres
                        •
                     tly shalbe shewed. After this (I say) S. Thomas in his seauenth article doth declare how that sometime, there may be a passiue scandall without an actiue, or taken, and not

giuen, as when one is scandalized, and falleth into sinne by another mans fact or speach without a iust cause, and this eyther of malice, by misinterpreting his wordes or deedes, or by ignorance, or infirmity by mistaking the same. The first is called Scandalum Pharisaeorum,

                  Now then, sayth S. Thomas, for so much as wee may not scandalize our brethren, or giue them any iust occasion by our words or actions, to fall into sinne, vnder so grieuous and horrible threatnings, as our Sauiour threatneth in the Ghospell, what shall we do when we see any man scandalized without a iust cause? Wherunto he answereth, that if it be the scandall of Pharises, that is to say, wilful, and out of malice, we must let them alone according to our Sauiours doctrine Matth. 15. and go forward in our doings, as himselfe did.S. Thomas expounded. But if the scandall which they take do ari

                      now it seemeth that his scandall is not of infirmity, but of malice. This is the doctrine of S. Thomas, which M. Barlow applieth to the Consciences of our English Catholikes, that refuse the Oath, which is hard to say, whether he doth it eyther of ignorance, or of malice, or of both. But sure I am he abuseth egregiously the meaning of S. Thomas, who writeth this of those only that take scandall, and occasion of fal where none is giuen

And such men may be accompted in our case, those Catholickes that would not be scandalized, nor fall into sin and ruine of their soules by the vnlawfull Oath offered vnto them, but chose rather to incur the penalty of the law. The other, as more imperfect, tooke the scandall that was giuen them, and eyther must be presumed to haue sworne against their consciences, if they were Catholickes, or to haue followed an erroneous conscience in this matter, if they tooke the Oath as it lieth, as may appeare by the declaration of the Sea Apostolicke.
                  Well then to conclude, let vs repeat briefly M. Barl.
                     
contexture, and see his defects. Is the exacting of the Oath (saith he) a scandall actiue in our Magistrates? then is it passiue in their Catholickes. Which inference I haue allowed in some Catholickes of the weaker sort, that tooke the Oath, but not in all (for it is no scandall giuen (saith he) if it be not taken.) This I haue shewed to be very false. It followeth. If their consciences be offended at it, they are, saith Aquinas, eyther simply ignorant, or wickedly malicious. This I haue shewed for the later part not to be in Aquinas, and for the former, euill applied, and falsly alleadged: euill applied, for those wordes which in Aquinas his sense appertayne to weake Catholickes that tooke the Oath, this man ascribeth to the more constant that refused the same. Misalleaged also it is,The errours of M. Barlow about the matter of scādall. for that Aquinas sayth not, 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                         their consciences be offended at it, for that it is another thing for consciences to be offended at a thing, and mislike the same, then to be scandalized & fall therby into sinne: for the former may be in perfect men; yea the more perfect they be, the more are they offended and grieued with euill things, that may scandalize, but the later cannot, as now out of S. Thomas hath bene declared. And againe a man may be scandalized and fall into sinne by another mans word, or act that offendeth him not, but rather pleaseth him: as when a yong man by some lasciuious speach, or fact of his companion, should fall into fornication himselfe, he is scandalized therby but not offended.
                  So as M. Barlow seemeth to speake exactly in nothing: for neyther doth he translate well the word perfect, vsed by S. Thomas, o

A rare example of Bishoply patience, such as I thinke was neuer seene in that Church before.
                  Neither is euery man truly sanctified, to be reputed for perfect, on whome scandall may not fall, for that a Iew, or a Gentile newly baptized are truly sanctified, and yet if you should exact workes of perfection at their hands, as patience in aduersities, mortification of their passions & appetites, contempt of the world, stability, and immobility in Gods loue and seruice, perhaps you should not find the same.

                  I do pretermitt, as very fond and impertinent, the next passage that ensueth (and is the last in this matter) in M. Barlow his booke, where he maketh this demaund: But what if there be none, or few that make such conscience, or take such offence at the admission of the Oath, as he speaketh of? To this question I say, it is in vaine to answere, for if there be so few, or no Catholikes, that make conscience, or scruple to take the Oath, the contention will be soone at an end. But presently he contradicteth himselfe againe, taking another medium, and saying, that there would be none, if they were not threatned by vs, to haue their howses ouerturned, as some Donatists, sayth he, confessed of themselues, by the witnesse of S. Augustine,

temporall obedience and allegiance, which of loyall Catholicke subiects may be exacted. And this shall suffice for this first point, concerning the contents and nature of this Oath.
               
               This was my speach and conclusion then. And now shal we take a vew how it is confuted by M. Barlow. First be amplifyeth & exaggerateth with great vehemēcy the torments and tortures of our Inquisitions, which are vsed, as he saith,M. Barlow speaketh mor
                        •
                      then he can proue. with the most extreme violence, that flesh can indure, or malice inuent: wherin he sayth more I thinke, then he knoweth, and more perhaps then he belieueth, and at leastwise much more then is true in my knowledg. For of twenty that are imprisoned there, not one lightly is touched with torture: and when any is in the case, by law appointed, it is knowne to be more mildly, then commonly in any other tribunall. But let vs leaue this as of least moment, and depending only vpon his asseueration, and my denyall, and let vs passe to that which is of more importance, for iustifying the cause it selfe, to wit, by what right of power and authority, the Roman Church proceedeth against heretickes, and how different it is from that wherby Protestants pretend to be able iustly to proceed against vs for matters of Religion.
               First of all he sayth, that I do take as granted, that the Church of Rome is the Catholike Church, which we deny sayth he, and the chiefest learned of their side could as yet neuer conuict our denialls. Wherto I answere that if themselues may be iudges, that are most interessed in the controuersie, I do not meruaile, though they neuer yield themselues for conuicted. But if any indifferent iudgment or triall might be admitted, I do not doubt, but that their euiction and cō
                  uiction, would quickly appeare: and many learned men of our dayes haue made most cleare demonstrations therof, by deducing the Roman Church, doctrine, and fayth, from the Apostles dayes, vnto our times successiuely,The success

Augustine, Tertullian, Irenaeus, and others, that brought downe the descent of the true Catholike Church, by the succession of the Roman Bishops, as Heads of the same.

                  Barlow demaundeth of me, in what sense I take the word Catholike, when I suppose the Roman Church to be the Catholicke Church? For if I take it (sayth he) for Vniuersall, then Rome being but a particuler Citty, and the true iurisdiction therof, confined within a limited Diocesse, or Prouince, the Roman Church cannot be the Catholicke or Vniuersall Church,M. Barlows arguments against the Church of Rome. for that it is but a particular Prouince. But if (sayth he) I take Catholike, for the profession of the true fayth, as S. Cyprian doth, calling that Church of Africa, the Catholike Church, then cannot the Romish Church neyther in this sense be the Catholik Church: for that which the Prophet Esay said of the Iewes Church, Her gould is mixed with drosse, and she whose fayth was plighted in Christ, is become an Adultresse, may be sayd also of the Roman Church of this day, and so cannot be the Catholike Church &c.
Which are two such mighty arguments, as well declare the poore mans misery in the defence of his cause.
               For to the first I would aske M. Barlow whether one man may not haue two Iurisdictions, or rather one Iurisdiction extended differently to two things, one more particuler, the other more generall. As for example, the Mayor of London hath his particuler gouerment first and immediatly ouer his owne howse, family, and peculiar lands, and yet besides that, he hath iurisdiction also ouer all the Citty. And to make the case more cleare, let vs suppose

that he hath both the one & the other from the king
                     •
                   shall it be a good argument to say, that he is Gouernor of his owne particuler landes, house, and family, which is knowne to be confined and limited to such a part of the Citty, therfore he vsurpeth by stiling himself lord Gouernour of the whole Citty? And the like demaund may be made of the Kings authority first and imediatly ouer his Crowne lands, which is peculiar vnto him, and limited with confines, but yet it impeacheth not his generall authority ouer the whole Realme:The Pope both particuler Bishop of Rome, and yet chiefe Pastour of the whole Church. Euen so the Bishop of Rome hath two relations or references, the one as a seuerall Bishop, ouer that people, and so had S. Peter who was Bishop of the same place, euen as S. Iames had of Ierusalem, S. Iohn of Ephesus, and the like: and besids this, he hath an vniuersall Superintendency and iurisdiction giuen him ouer all, as Head of the rest. So as Catholikes doe not deny but that the Church of Rome, as it maketh a particuler Prouince or Diocesse, is a member only of the Catholicke Church, not the whole, though a principall & chiefe member, by the reason of the eminēcy of her Pastour, & that the sayd Pastour therof is but a member also of the Catholik Church, but yet the chiefest mēber, wherunto all the rest are subordinate, that is to say the head & guid therof. So as this is poore argument as you see.
               But the second is more pittifull, if you consider it well: for if we take Catholike, sayth he, for the profession of the true faith, as S. Cyprian did, when he called the Church of Africa the Catholike Church; then cannot the Romish Church be the Catholike Church. And why? for that her gould is mixed with drosse, as the Prophet Isay sayd of the Iewish Church in his tyme.M. Barlowes bad argument which is false both in antecedent and consequent. But here are two propositions, an antecedent, and consequent and both of them false. The antecedent is, that as the Church of the Iewes, in the Prophet Isay his dayes, being in her corrupt state, was not the true teaching Church, in respect of the naughty life vsed therein: so neyther the Church of Rome in our dayes being full of the same sinnes & bad life, can be the true Catholicke Church: this antecedent, I say, is most

                  uidently false, and impertinent, for

that Isay the Prophet in the place cited, doth not rep

                  ners; nor doth he so much as name their Church or Synagoge, or taxe their false teaching. For albeit the wicked King Manasses that afterward slew him, did perforce set vp false Gods among the Iewes: yet did not only he, and other Prophets then liuing, to wit Oseas, Amos, Micheas, I
                        •••
                     , Ioel, Nahum, Habacuc, with the whole Church and Synagog not admit the same, but resisted also what they might, which is a signe that their faith was pure and good. Wherfore Isay in this place alleadged, nameth not their Church or Religion, as hath bene sayd, but expresly nameth the Cittie of Hierusalem, & wicked liuers therin, saying: Q

                     h? Of wicked life, or of false doctrine? and if it be euident, that he speaketh of manners, as he doth indeed, then how false is the dealing of M. Barlow, in bringing it i
                     •
                   for proofe of false teaching, and to conuince, that as the Church of the Iewes could not be the true Catholicke Church of that time, in respect of the corrupt māners vsed in her: so cannot the Church of Rome at this day, for the selfe same cause be the true Church?
               But I would demande of M. Barlow, what other knowne Church had God in those dayes wherin a man might find true doctrine, besides that of the Iewes, which, he sayeth, was not the true Church? Will he say perhaps of the Gentills? But they liued all in Idolatry. And if a Gētile would in those daies haue left his Idolatry in the time of Isay the Prophet, and haue desired to haue bene mad
                     •
                   one of the people of God by true instruction, whither could he haue gone for the same, but only to the

Iewish Church? And whither would Isay haue sent him, but to the Gouernours thereof? Both false and impious then, is this antecedent about the Iewes Church, but much more the consequent that would draw in the Roman Christian Church by this example,Euill life doth not preiudice truth of doctrine. which hath no similitude or connection at all. For neither can he proue that it hath such corruption in it, either in life, or doctrine, as he pretendeth: nor if it had in life, doth it preiudice the truth of Doctrine, as by the testimony of our Sauiours owne wordes wee remaine assured.
               These two obiections then, that the Roman Church for that she hath a determinate Prouince, as also for that shee hath sundry euill liuers in her, are shewed to bee of no force at all. Not the later, for that euill manners may stand with true doctrine: not the first, for that wee doe not say the Roman Church is the whole Catholick Church but a chiefe member thereof, as hath bene sayd: whereby also will appeare what wee meane by the name of the Catholicke Church, to wit, that visible vniuersall Church, which being erected and founded by Christ our Sauiour, when he was vpon earth, hath continued euer since and descended visibly from age to age, by succession of Bishops throughout all Christendome vnto our times, and shall so continue vnto the worldes end: by which description may appeare also how vaine another obiection is of M. Barlow, in these wordes:
If Vincentius rule be true, that that only is to be accounted Catholicke Doctrine,
                        Barl. p. 60. 
                     quod semper, vbique, & ab omnibus creditum est, neyther shall Rome be proued Catholicke, nor England hereticke: when any of these is soundly determined, then let him plead her Ius acquisitum.
                  
               
               VVhereto I answere, that the rule of Vincentius is verified, by that which I haue sayd before, of the nature of the Catholicke Church, to wit, that it began vnder Christ, and hath descended from age to age, and so shee teacheth, quod semper creditum est. And for that she hath imbraced all nations, she teacheth quod vbique, in respect of place: and for that shee hath vnion of Doctrine, shee

teacheth quod ab omnibus creditum est. For albeit there h

                      acquisitum, or ancient right and power, vpon all Heretickes for theyr correction and punishment, I sayd, was manifest, for that by baptisme they were made her subiectes. Vnto which point M. Barlow would seeme now to say somewhat,M. Barlowes Ministeriall phrases of indument and stripping.
                   though neuer so impertinent: therefore he telleth vs a tale of an indument, and a stripping to be considered in Baptisme, vnder the wordes, Credo, and Abre

               Whereunto I answere, that the whole action in that Sacrament without so many diuisions and subdiuisions, as here he maketh to obscure the matter, doth make him and all other Christians liable to the Catholike Church. For that euery man that is baptized, as he is made a member and seruant of Christ therby,By Baptisme we are made members of the Church. and entreth into his Church, as by the first dore; soe is he made a subiect to the sayd Church, and is liable to her correction, if he should renounce, change, or peruert that fayth, which there he professeth as a child of the sayd Church. And all this I thinke M. Barlow will not deny: but onely his question may be of such as are baptized out of the Catholike Church, by some Hereticall Congregation; yet notwithstanding the matter is cleare, for that such baptisme houlding only so far forth as they haue intention to doe that in their baptisme, which the true Catholicke Church doth, and vse the forme of wordes which the sayd Church prescribeth, to wit, I baptize thee in the name of the Father

                      the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghost, for that otherwise if either of these conditions, to wit, eyther the forme, or the intention of the Catholike Church doe faile, the baptisme is not auaylable: it is euident, I say, that such as are so baptized out of the Church, are liable notwithstanding

to the same, for any offence that they shall commit against the fayth of the sayd Catholike Church; for so much as their baptisme had relation to this Church, as is now declared.

               But now besids this reason of obligation by baptisme, I do alledge another of former possession and prescription, whereby the English Catholike Church hath had, & exercised this power of punishing Sectaries frō time to time: wherunto M.

Which is so absurd an answere, as nothing could more shew & declare, that he had nothing to say, then this.

               And then passing to examine particuler heresies, and beginning with them that pretended to be of greatest antiquity, yea from the Apostles times themselues, he giueth also a Prescription how to try them. If any heresies (saith he) dare presume to thrust themselues into the Apostles age, edant origines Ecclesiarum suarum, euoluant ordines Episcoporum, let them publish the beginninges of their Churches, and let them lay forth the order & successiō of their Bishops.

               And furthermore he disputing against Marcion the Hereticke, hath these wordes:
                     Tertul. aduers. Marc. lib. 4. 
                  Ego dico meum Euangelium verum, Marcion suum &c. I say that my Ghospell is true, and Marcio

who shal determine the matter between vs, but the difference of time, that will giue Authority to that which shalbe found to be most ancient, and pronounce that to be corrupted which shalbe proued to be the later? So as here supposing that which before we haue touched, that Catholick doctrine was planted first,
                  
before any heresy sprang vp, by the Prescription of time,The Fathers do vrge prescription. is not only a sound argument in case of religion (which fondly M. Barlow denieth) but a conuincent demonstration also of truth; and to that effect vsed commonly by all Fathers, that wrote against Hereticks after Tertullian.

For the first, sayth he, may be clayme by intrusion, which is their case that plead for Rome, & the other may be antiquity of error, for so is prescription without verity: therefore when truth appeares, let custome yeld to truth, was the conclusion of a Councell.

Barlow wel knoweth, or should know, that, that Councell or Synod was

                     gustine in his booke against the Donatists, where he setteth downe the sentences of diuers of that Councell, and among other one of Zozimus, which he sayth was this: so it appeareth also in S. Cyprian: Reuelatione facta veritatis, 
                        〈◊〉
                      error veritati, when the truth is reueyled, let error yeild to truth. Vpon which wordes S. Augustine maketh this note, Noluit quide
                        •
                      iste dicere consuetudinem, sed errorem. This Bishop would not say that custome s
                     •
                  ould yield, but error. And yet M. Barlow against the testimony of them both would needes relate it otherwise, let custome yeeld to truth, and say it was the Conclusion of a Councell, which was neyther of the Councel, nor any in the Councell; for that sometims custome conteyneth truth it selfe, and giueth testimony to truth, and wee know it to be truth by tradition of custome: so as the ancient Fathers went warily herein, & not so rashly against all kind of custome, as M. Barlow & his fellowes and followers doe.
               But perhaps he will alledge out of M. Morton & other his fellow-writers, the saying of S. Cyprian himselfe in his Epistle ad Pompeium: Consuetudo sine veritate, vetustas erroris est, Custome without truth, is antiquity of error: which all men will grant, but maketh nothing to our case. For wee suppose true religion to haue bene planted first by Christ & afterward heresie to haue risen: which supposall being true, the argument of the Fathers before mentioned is most effectuall. We were before you in Christian religion and you rose vp after vs,How posse

                     tters of fayth. professing a different faith from vs: Ergo, our religion is Catholike, and yours Heresy. For that this is to be accounted Catholike doctrine, as M. Barlow before alledgeth himselfe out of Vincentius, quod semper creditum est, that alwaies hath bene beleiued since the beginning of Christianity; and soe that which is most ancient is truest. And where M. Barlow sayth, that possession may be a claime by intrusion, it may be indeed in temporall possession, but not in this our case, especially when it is ioyned with

Prescription from antiquity. For supposing that the true Catholike religion was first put in possession by our Sauiour, and his Apostles, as hath bene sayd, and that it can be proued that this possession hath beene continued by Prescription, time out of mind, euen from the beginning, as we offer to proue: & that on the contrary side no knowne interruption can be shewed of this possessiō, eyther by intrusion or other wise, as M. Barlow cannot proue that there hath bene, nor doth he go about to proue it, though he blush not to say it; Possession in this case togeather with Prescription doth euince the verity of our cause.
               And for the saying of S. Cyprian, That custome without verity is the antiquity of errour, though in it selfe it be true, yet doth S. Augustine tell vs, that it was ill applied by S. Cyprian, again

But yet otherwise when he was out of that necessity of defending an errour, himselfe sayth, he did not only allow of custome, but also did often vrge the custome, and traditiō of the Church for very good arguments, and proueth many Catholicke doctrines therby, as the necessity of Chrisme or Vnction, lib. 1.

                     orce, and so possessed Christendome, in such sort as for many ages the said Protestant Church appeared not publikely, vntill these our dayes, I would demaund of M. Barlow,
                  M. Barlow hardly vrged. Whether this his Church so put to flight from the eies of Christendome, did perish, or lay hidden only. For if it perished, then the true Church of Christ perished, and the promises made by him, were not performed,
                     Matth. vlt.
                   
                  That he wo

                     ld be with the same vnto the end of the world: That the gates of hell should not preuaile against it:
                     Matth. 16.
                   for that in this case, the sayd hell should haue preuailed. Moreouer I would demaund, if she once perished how could she be raised to life againe? In which case S. Augustine writing against the Donatists, saith thus: Si peri
                        •
                     t Ecclesia, vnde ergo Donatus apparuit? Dic de qua terra germinauit? De quo mari emersit? De quo caelo cecidit? If the true Church did perish, from whence is Donatus come vnto vs? Out of what groūd is he sprong? Out of what sea hath he peept? From what heauen is he fallen? which S. Augustin
                        •
                     
                   saith, for that if the true Church were perished before Donatus was borne, in what Church was he borne, and how came he into the true Church, that now he braggeth of? and how did that Church rise from death to life againe!
               But if M. Barlow will say, that the Protestant Church which flourished in, and after the Apostles times, did not perish, but fled only into the wildernes, and lay hidden, being spread visibly before ouer all the whole world (for so he must say, if she were the Catholike Church:) then would I demaund him, whether this Church being thus in exile, and couert, but yet liuing, did make profession of her fayth or not, and if she made profession therof, as she was bound, for that as S. Paul sayth to the Romans, Ore

                      salutem; Confession of our faith is necessary to our saluation: then by this confession she must needs make her selfe knowne, as Martyrs, and Confessours did in time of persecution, and then she cannot be sayd to haue layen hidden, and couert from the sight of the world, no more then the Christian Church lay hidden in the time of persecution, in Rome, and other places, when men and women lay in caues vnder ground, but yet the confession of their fayth appeared vnto the whole world: and no more then the Catholike religion may be sayd to ly hidden now at this day in England, when all Christendome can be witnes of their Confession of the Catholike fayth: which point I thinke M. Barlow doth not take vpon him to proue of the Protestants Confession in ancient ages.
               Yf then he will say, that the sayd Church lay altogeather hidden indeed, without any publicke confession of their fayth: then must he confesse that the state and condition of this Church which was the only true Church which Christ had vpō earth, & of whose exceeding glory the Prophets did foretell so many wonderfull things, was more miserable then any least Sect of heretickes that euer was; ye

And this demonstration is sufficient to conuince the vanity of M. Barlow his assertion, that Possessio

                   and Prescription for time, are no good arguments in case of Religion.
               The last point which he toucheth, as he passeth it ouer very sleigtly, so shall I as briefly answer the same. I sayd in my Letter that among other considerations, this was one very considerable, that there was neuer any such Oath as this is, exacted at the hands of Catholicke subiects, either by any of their owne Kings, or Princes at

                   they odered such Oathes to their subiects that were of different opinion in religion: all which M. Barlow in effect confessing, or not contradicting, sayth:
                     Barl. pag. 62. 
                  If other Princes 
                        〈◊〉
                      not the like, we iudge them not: perhaps it is in some of them an infused persuasion, that it is not lawfull: in others peraduenture it is a violent restraint, yea gladly they would, but cannot be suffered. Where you see that all his answers goeth by i

                     s and ands, perhaps and peraduentures, and yet is the matter of moment, and sequele, if it be well pondered, to take a course of extraordinary rigour, different from all other Christian Princes besides.
               It is not the Parasiticall flattery of a few Ministers at home, respecting their owne trenchers, will worke the State so much honour & security, as the generall mislikes and murmurations abroad, may worke the contrary in time. He sayth, that his Maiesty wanted not a motiue to take this course, for that the Pope was not so insolently busy with any nation, as of late with his Maiesty, and his Kingdome. He addeth further, that if it had not bene for him, our gracious King might haue enioyed a peace more continuall and happy, then Salomon or Augustus.
               
               But I would aske him out of passion, if euer he be voyd therof, as by report he is very seldome, what insolencie hath this Pope shewed in being busy, as he calleth it, with his Maiesties Person, State, or Realme? For as for his Person he hath alwayes honoured the same, both before he was Pope and after, wherof many euident testimonies might be alleadged: and for his State and Kingdome, while he was in Scotland, neyther he, nor his Predecessours did go about to trouble the same, in almost fourty yeares, while he reygned there: all troubles came from Protestants and their Ministers. And when his Maiesty was called into England, the Pope that then was, by this mans counsaile principally, as it may be presumed, for that

he was Protectour of Scotland, wrote to the Catholickes to further their Obedience towards him. He neuer medled in any thing, vntill this Oath so preiudiciall vnto his Authority, and vnto the Consciences of Catholikes was proposed and vrged.
               And as for the peace here named, more continuall & happy then that of Salomon or Augustus, which M. Barlow sayth might be enioyed by his Maiestie, with his Subiects, if the Pope were not: it is well, that he will so much as name peace, who seemeth in all his speaches, to sow the seeds of warres, hatred, and contention. But if his mind were to peace indeed, he cannot be so simple, but to see, that the rigorous and afflictiue courses vsed, and this, as all men take it, by the instigation of those of his coate and order, cannot be meanes to peace of mindes, howsoeuer otherwise they liue in externall quietnes and deuoyd of tumults. And this is all, that for the present I haue to write in this matter.

               CONCERNING M. BARLOVVE His exorbitant flattery in exaggerating Queene Elizabeths Vertues, and Sanctity. CHAP. I.
               OVR purpose then, being as now we haue declared, to touch some principal points only, handled by M. Barlow in this second and third Part of his answere,About Q. Elizabeths raigne, life, & death, we shall begin with the point he most standeth vpon, dilating himself for twenty leaues togeather cōcerning Queene Elizabeth her raigne, life, and death, as an argument

very plausible in his opinion, and capable not only of his rayling eloquence, and odious amplifications, but of all grosse and abiect flattery in like manner; togeather with some hopes of other gaines also that way, wherunto it seemeth that the poore man hath his tongue and pen most ready to the sale at all turnes and occasions offered. But it may be before we end this conference, his market may be more then halfe marred in the iudgment, at least of disappassionate men, & especially with his most Excellēt Maiesty, whome aboue all other he seeketh to gull in this matter, turning all vpon him, which I both spake and meant to a Minister of M. Barlowes owne ranke: & so I disclaime from the calumnious imputation, that it concerneth any way his Highnesse, and shall answere all in the same sense which I then wrote, and meant the same; reseruing all dutyfull and respectiue reference to his Maiesties Person and Iudgment, as bounden duty obligeth me.
               First then occasion being offered, or rather necessity imposed to speake of Queene Elizabeth: for that albeit the Pope had not so much as named her in any of his two Breues, yet had the Apologer brought in her mentiō with many high praises, for disgrasing of Catholickes, and their cause, and for scorne to the Pope, as though he had without cause pittyed and mourned their afflictions vnder her, which he saith was none at all, for that to his own knowledge she neuer punished any Papist for Religion. For these causes, I say, I was forced in my Letter, to say somewhat to this assertiue proposition, wherunto the tribulations, afflictions, calamities, spoiles, exiles, and bloud of so many shed by her, did manifestly in the eyes and eares of al men and women that haue liued in our dayes, contradict and reclaime. And yet did I resolue to do the same as mildly and sparingly as I might, answering only the wordes of the Apologie, and abstayning purposely from al bitternesse of speach, so far as the iust defence of the cause permitted, and so shall continue 
                     〈…〉
                   
                  Barlowes most intemperate prouocation to the contrary.
               VVhereas then in reciting the wordes of the Apologer,

I mentioned these: Hauing, sayth he, sacrificed, as I may say, to the Manes of my defunct Soueraigne, as well for the discharge of my particuler dutie, as loue of veritie, I must now performe my d
                        •
                     ty also to his Maiestie present &c. Vpon which wordes I noted that the phrase of sacrificing to the Queenes Manes, or Ghostes, seemed to me very profane, as proper to the Pagan Sacrifices, vsed to those infernall spirits which they called Gods, & hurtful Gods, & therfore endeauored to please them with sacrifices. My words & discourse were these.
               
                  But as for his heathen profane sacrificing to the Manes or Hob-goblins of his late Lady,
I confesse it is an office fitter for a Protestant-Minister,
                        Lett. p. 27. that thinketh it vnlawfull to pray for her soule, to deale with her Manes, or infernall spirites, then with Celestiall,Queene Elizabeth her Manes
                      by praying for her to Saints. But would God these Manes might now haue licēce to appeare, and talke which him, and relate what passeth with her, after all this ioylity, and ruffe in this world; I doubt not but they would coole his excessiue vaine of flattering vanity. For if all the old platforme of Saints liues, prescribed in Scriptures, and practised by the seruants of God, were not erroneous and vaine, as much fasting, continual prayer, daily mortification, frequent recollection, diligent chastisement of theyr bodies, humble & feruent deuotion, labouring and working theyr saluation in feare and trembling, aboundant almes-deedes, haire-cloth and ashes, contrition, sorrow and sobbing for their sinnes: yf these things (I say) were the ancient wayes to life, and euerlasting saluation: then must the pathes of Queene Elizabeth, which are knowne by most men, to haue bene eyther wholy different, or most opposite to these, led to another opposite end, quia vnusquisque recipiet secundum opera s
                           ••
                        . Euery one shall receiue according to his, or her works: and the sentence of the Apostle is cleare & resolute: Si secundum carnem vixeritis, moriemini; si facta carnis spiritu mortificaueritis vi
                           •
                        etis: if you liue according to the flesh you shall die; but if you shall mortify by spirit the workes of the flesh, you shall liue, that is, to life euerlasting.
               
               About these words of mine M. Barlow taketh occasion

to make very large discourses, and to dilate himselfe in three or foure points 
                     •
                  xceedingly. First in the excessiue prayses of the Queene; then in superlatiue raylinges against me; thirdly in iustifying the phrase of sacrificing to the dead Queens ghost; & fourthly in setting out her frequent mortifications, that she vsed: but yet in such sort, as he well sheweth, not only not to feele what mortification is in it selfe, but neither to vnderstand what he saith, nor wherof he affirmeth.
               In the first point of Queene Elizabeths praises he straineth his eloquēce or rather loquence to the vttermost,M. Barlowes flattering loquence. as though neyther the earth whilst shee was here, nor scarce heauē where now he assureth vs she is, were worthy of her: Shee was a daughter of the bloud Royall, sayth he, borne to the Crowne, in the Prophetes wordes, from the birth, from the wombe,

                      right, and by vncontrolable succession &c. Thus he sayth, and yet doth the world know what store of controuersies was about that succession, and lawfullnes thereof, and they are extant in theyr owne Statutes yet in print; so as this man talketh that which he thinketh to be most acceptable, and fit for his presēt purpose of adulation more then what he findeth written or registred, or belieueth himselfe for that matter; and such as know the man, and his constitution, are of opinion, that if his Maiestie that now is, had come into England with that minde, which his Noble Mother and her husband the King of France are knowne once to haue had, to claime & iustify her title, presently after the death of Queene Mary (for so doth Doctor Sanders t

                   plate, but that by the peace made, & Calis released vnto thē for the same, they were pacified for that time) it is to be presumed that his Maiestie if he had preuayled in his pretence, that he should haue found no one man more fit or readie in England, or Scotland, to haue gon vp to Paules Crosse, or to any other place else, to iustifie his Maiesties Mothers pretence, against Queene Elizabeth, or to disgrace her

whome now he extolleth so much, euen in this point of legitimation, from the belly, from the wombe, from the conception, by apparent right, incontrolable succession, and the like.
               But now the wind bloweth another way, and he followeth the blast, and turneth his sayles according to the weather:M. Barl. turnes with the wynd like a weathercocke. let vs then heare him out further. She was (sayth he) an Imperiall Monarch, a famous Empresse, or rather the very Empresse of

                     ame, blazoned out, not by home-bred fauourites, but by forraine trauailers, and writers, before and since her death, yea,

                      fame, report was lesse then verity, and her renowne was far short of her desert. Thus far our Oratour. And doth he not seeme to speake well for his fee?
               But yet whē he telleth vs how his famous Empresse or Empresse of fame, is blazoned not only at home, but abroad by forraine writers,Quene Elizabeth otherwise blazoned by forrain writers then M. Barlow reporteth. he will not forget I hope to remember, that shee is blazoned by many of them in farre other colours then heere he painteth her out: and this partly in respect of her hard measure towards Catholikes, whose religion shee professed vnder Queene Mary, and made many fayre promises of continuance therin; for the breach wherof, and contrary proceeding afterward when she came to the Crowne, she susteyned so hard a conceipt and bad opinion of all forrayne Princes, people, & Kingdomes Catholik, as the memory perhapes of no one Christian Prince or Princesse that euer liued, is more vngratefull and odious to them. And this is the very truth notwithstanding all this parasiticall flattery of the Minister: which I speake as God knoweth with great compassion towards her, and our Countrey, for her sake, and not with

any humor of reuenge, insultation, or exprobratiō against her. The histories are extant, their speaches and iudgements are knowne to such as doe trauaile forreine Countreys, and with indifferency and attention doe marke what passeth among them.
               But yet this man sitting at home in his warme chāber, goeth further in his exaltations of her: and to pretermit many, as ouerlong for this place, he sayth,
                     Barlow. p. 66. & 67. 
                  That all her actions, being Royally vertuous, vertuously religious, and religiously wise; her wisedome seasoned her religion, her religion sanctified her policyes, her polices graced her descent, all of them togeather wrought her immortality, and her immortality is accompayned with renowne vpon earth, and reward in heauen. So he, and much more, which I pretermit as idle froath of a flattering tongue, who taketh vpon him also to Canonize her with the terme of Eternized Saynt, and affirmeth resolutely, that shee neuer blemi

                  Q. Elizabeth Canonized for a Saint by M. Barlow. I know not, exept he meaneth as the word importeth, that she continued not from vice to vice without interruption, which had bene horrible to haue done (if not impossible) or had perseuered continually in one and the selfe same vice criminall, which had bene as bad if not worse. He auoucheth further of her, that shee neuer in her life committed hellish crime; wherby I suppose, he meaneth mortall sinne, for that the payne & punishmēt therof is hell, according to S. Paules doctrine, and then I confesse that this were to be accompted an extraordinary sanctity indeed,Q. Elizabeth in M. Barl. his iudgment neuer cō

                      mortal sinne. that a woman brought vp in such liberty, for so many yeares togeather, in so corrupt a time (who as M. Barlow here telleth vs, was no Cloystred-Nun, but a Queene that liued in all prosperity in the midest of all temptations and allurements, both of Sathan, the flesh, and the world) should neuer commit so much as one mortall sinne.
               But I would aske M. Barlow, how he commeth to know this secret? did he euer heare her Confession? For if he did, he might with far better conscience vtter her vertues knowne thereby, to her prayse, and to the edification

of others, then he did the Earle of Essex his vices, to his infamy, and other mens scandall. But I for my part doe thinke, that albeit Queene Elizabeth went often to confession in Queene Maries dayes, yet from that time to her death, which was more then forty yeares, she neuer tooke the benefit of that Sacrament;Q. Elizabeth would neuer haue chosen M. Barlow for her ghostly Father. in which long time wee may wel imagine what store of dust a house much frequented would haue gathered, that had neuer bene swep
                     •
                   in so long a space. And albeit shee had had, both grace, wil, and time to cōfesse her sins, yet do I belieue that she would neuer haue chosen M. Barlow for her Confessour, and Ghostly Father; and consequently all that he talketh here of her vices criminall, and not continued, and of hellish crimes neuer committed, is spoken without booke, vpon no greater ground, then that he listeth to say and write so of her. And this shall serue for the first point, concerning his excessiue prayses of Queene Elizabeth, though we shall haue occasiō to handle somewhat therof againe in the fourth point about her mortifications.
               Touching the second point then of impotent and exorbitant railing; albeit much were to be sayd; yet doe I not meane to loose time in the repeating thereof, or iniurie the eares of graue and modest men with hearing such contemptible matter: it is reuenge inough for me to vnderstand by diuers wayes, as I doe, that his owne friends doe condemne him, and thinke contemptuously of him, for entring into such an odious kind of writing. And for other that are different from him in religion, though they thinke him not worthy of any Answere, that taketh such a course; yet haue I thought good for this once to bestow so much paynes as to runne his Booke ouer, and to returne him answere to other points, though not to this, but yet so, as by those other points which I handle, the mans spirit may be so well knowne, as none will meruayle that he tooke so dishonest and impudent a course of virulēt rayling.
               As for the third poynt of sacrificing to the Manes or Ghostes of the dead Queene Elizabeth, true it is, that supposing

my selfe to haue to do with a Minister, that vsed the phrase,About Q. Elizabeths Manes & sacrificing vnto thē. in the case he did, I noted it as Heathenish and prophane, in respect of both words, to wit sacrificing to Ghost, especially Infernall, himselfe being enemie to all Christian Sacrifice, or prayers for soules Christianly departed, or intercession to be made for them to Saints in heauen, that are Supernall Ghosts, and not Infernall. By which occasion M. Barlow taketh matter to dilate himselfe much (as he doth willingly when he findeth any thing to talke of, though neuer so impertinent) to proue that this phrase of sacrificing to dead Ghosts, though it were proper to the Gentiles and Pagans, may also be vsed of Christians in a good sense:
                     Barl. p. 74. 
                  Especially, sayth he, it being vsed by his Maiesty, as a borrowed phrase, and vttered with a deprecatory parenthesis, as it were in modesty, asking leaue for the passage therof, secretly therby insinuating, that otherwise, it was that which among the Rhetoritians is called audax Metaphora, a bould Metaphore.
               
               Wherunto I answere, that with all these circumstāces I see no difficulty, but that the phrase may be vsed, especially by audax Metaphora, and by so great a Prince, whose licence in speach good reason alloweth to be larger then other men: nor had I euer put difficulty in the phrase, if I had knowne it to haue come from his Maiestie. But for a Minister to be so bould in his audacious Metaphors, seemed not so tollerable: so as in the thing it selfe, supposing the former qualifications, I haue no further controuersie. But yet I must note, that the arguments scraped togeather by M. Barlow,

Basill, affirming that we may vse the learning of the Gentiles to the aduancement of Christian Religion, as the Israelites did the spoyles of the AEgyptians, are to be vnderstood of such poynts of their learning, as may piously be applyed to our vse, to wit their morall doctrine, Histories, Philosophy, Examples, Sentences, Comparisons and the like, but yet do not allow that we should vse the peculiar phrases of their Idolatrous worship, about the mysteries of our

Christian Religion, as certaine new prophane companions of our age haue done, I meane Castalio and others, calling God, Iupiter, and our B. Lady Diana, and the like.

Pet. 2. 4. do name these chaines of darknes wherwith they are bound in hel; which words of chaines & hell, are to be found in Poets? Is this a sufficient proofe that Pagan phrases concerning matters of religion may be vsed also in our Diuinity? I pretermit his idle bringing in of S. Paul, that vsed halfe a verse of Aratus, a heathen Poet, when he spake in the Councell house of the Areopagus in Athens;

                     aken here in this life:
wherof I said by iust occasion giuen, That if the old platforme of Saints liues prescribed in Scriptures, and practised by the seruants of God, were not erroneous and vayne, as much fasting, continuall prayer, dayly mortification, frequent recollection, diligent chasticement of their bodies, aboundant almes-deeds, hairecloath, and ashes, and the like: if these things I say, were anciently accounted Viae vitae, wayes to life, as often and highly commended in the Scriptures by the Holy Ghost, and practised from time to time in the liues of the holiest men in the Christian Church; then sayd I, must the wayes and paths of Queene Elizabeths life which are knowne to be far different from these, be very dangerous, and the end and successe thereof not so assured of glory, as her flatterers both promised her in her life, and now will needs after her death, beare men downe that it is performed.
                  
                  
                     To this M. Barlow answereth in diuers sorts: first out of the Epistle of S. Paul to the Romans,
                     
                        Rom. 14.4.

                        lleth? But this place is manifestly abused by M. Barlow, as are commonly all other Scriptures alleadged by him. For S. Paul speaketh in this place of indifferent things, as of eating and drinking, in which a man may not condemne rashly another,In what cases a mā may iudg of another

                        n manducat, manducantem non iudicet, he that eateth not, let him not iudge him that eateth. But touching our cause in hand, let him read the sentence of the fame Apostle to Timothy, both clearly and resolutely set downe,1. Tim. 5. 24. 
                     Querundam hominum peccata manisesta sunt, praecedentia ad iudicium: quosdam antem subsequuntur. Similiter & bona facta manisesta sunt, & quae aliter se habent, abscondi non p

                     innes of some men are manifest going before thē to iudgment: but in some other they follow. And so in like manner good workes are manifest, and those that be otherwise cannot be hidden. Wherby it is manifest in some cases, that a man may iudge, or at least wise haue a probable coniecture (for Almighty God may alter in secret what to his diuine wisedome and mercy shall seeme good) what end a Christian is like to ariue vnto, by the wayes wherin he walketh. And S. Paul himselfe doth set downe sundry particulars in diuers places of his Epistles, in which he sayth that Christians shall not be saued. So as this kind of iudgement is not wholy forbidden, but rash iudgment only.
                  Secondly then M. Barlowe commeth to lay hand on another answere, saying,
                        Barl. p. 75. 
                     That fasting with a sower countenance, prayer in open places, dole of almes with proclamations, are ensignes of hypocrites in our Sauiours iudgment. Wherto I reply that these are but the abuses of good things,
                        Matth. 6. which abuse the Seruants of God flying,About externall mortifications. do retayne the good vse. Thirdly sayth hee, (for he deuideth his proofes into sundry heads, and all not worth a rush) such outward habits of mortification as Iesuits terme, of wearing of heare-cloth, and the like,

                     eful and acceptable to God, as they do proceed from the internall mortification of the mind, and sorrow for their sins, and not otherwise. And that this externall mortification of Achab did so proceed, is euident by the very wordes of Scripture, alleadged by M. Barlow, which are these:Achab truly mortified. 
                     VVhen Achab had heard the speaches of the Prophet Elias, he rent his garmēts, & couered his flesh with haire-cloth and

And let it be marked, that he sayd humilitatus est mei causa, he hath humbled him selfe for my cause, which signifyed that it came from the hart, and from the sorrow that he conceyued, to haue offended God: which is true internall mortification, and made Achab, a true mortified or mortifying creature in that act, for which wee haue God himselfe for a witnes.Prophane impietie in M. Barlow. And it can be no lesse then prophane impiety, and sinfull secularity so prophanely to rest at it. But let vs passe to another parte of his Answere in this matter.

And so do the ancient Fathers vnderstand the words of exercise and piety,

For if it were bodily, it would no doubt nourish the body: but whereas it doth chastise the body, extenuateth and maketh it leane, it cannot any way be called corporall. So he.

Reg. 17. widdow of Sarepta did feed the Prophet Elias, with the bread that she had reserued for her sonne and her selfe. And then as for corporall exercise, named by the Apostle, he sayth it was meant of things belonging to the bodily health, as Sanctarum balnearum, venationum & huiusmodi quae ad breue tempus carnali proficiunt sanitati: holy bathes (such as holy men did vse for help of their health) hunting and other such bodily exercises for the same end, which do profit to the health of the flesh but for a short time, which admonition is thought to haue bene giuen by S. Paul to Timothy, as to a young man, that was somewhat delighted with these bodily exercises, or counsailed therunto by Phisitiōs for help of his said health. To which end also the said Apostle in the same Epistle exhorteth him not to drinke water still,M. Barlow no friend to mortifications. but to vse a little wine for help of his stomacke, and in regard of his other frequent infirmities. but yet would haue him to exercise himselfe in the workes of piety, as now hath bene sayd. So as this place also of S. Paul hath bene abused by M. Barlow his prophane interpretation against externall mortifications.
                  But now lastly he commeth neere vs indeed, and will shew that Queene Elizabeth her mortification was of another kind, perhaps not heard of before. Let vs heare his words: Fourthly (sayth he) to be a King, and to gouerne as a King should do, is mortification of it selfe. This is the largest way (I suppose) of mortification that he can lay before vs:A strange kind of mortifica

                     keth not, that he gouerneth well, and not only Kings & Princes are to be comprehended vnder this mortification, but proportionally also all other Magistrates and Gouernours

vnder them, who haue one poynt more of mortification lying vpon them, then their Supreme Princes, for that they are lyable to giue account to them, which the others are not, and consequently they are more subiect to mortification in their offices, and dignities; and yet most men do seeke after them, both in England and els where, which doth shew that there is great store of mortified men in the world, or at leastwise of men that loue this mortification, and desire to be so mortified. And if to be a Bishop also be a mortification, then hath M. Barlow in like manner proued himselfe a mortified man, & then those words of S. Paul to the Collossians, Mortificate membra vestra quae sunt super terram: Mortify your members which are vpon earth, may haue this sense also among other; do you mortify your self with some good Bishopricke, or other dignity, that in it selfe is a mortification. And do we not see what prophane trifling this is? And that by this drawing Christian vertues out of their compasse, true natures, and spheres, they do eneruate and euacuate all their force, and bring their practice to a meere sound of words.
                  The Catholike doctrine is, that mortification is a most excellent Christian vertue, commended highly in the Scriptures,Mortification. and exercised by all Saints, and especially by our Sauiour Christ, and his Apostles, and by the greatest Saints, & Seruants of his, that haue ensued in his Church, as may appeare as well by those words of S. Paul now recited, as also these other to the Romans:
                        Rom. 8. 13
                           •
                        . 
                     Si spiritu sacta carnis mortificaueritis, viuetis: If you shall mortify the works of the flesh by spirit, you shall liue. And then followeth the contrary set downe in the same place. If you shall not mortify your sayd members, & deeds of the flesh therof ensuing, but shall liue Secundum carnem, by obeying the lust therof, you shall dy euerlastingly. Wherby is also vnderstood, the nature of this excellent vertue, whose name of mortification is deriued from the word Mors, that signifieth Death: for that as when death entreth vpon a body and driueth out the soule, the sayd body remayneth without sense, 
                        •
                     eling, or other motion: so when this vertue of mortification

is well exercised of a Christian man, it doth take a way the sensuall life of our lusts and passions, and doth mortify them in their vnlawfull appetites, so as they remaine as it were feeble, cold, and dead, in resisting or rebelling against the superiour parts of the soule, directed by rea

                  Thus that holy and deuout Father of the workes and effects of mortification, and of his ardent loue that he had therunto. And the like I might most aboundantly shew out of other Fathers, but it were ouerlong for this place. The saying of S. Augustine vpon the former words of S. Paul is general to all men:

Gregory himselfe was, in taking the Popedome, to such a man it is a mortification indeed to

be a King, Prince, or Pope. But this riseth not out of the dignity it selfe as M. Barlow fondly teacheth, but out of the vertuous repugnance of the receiuers will: so as if Queene Elizabeth, to come to our proper case, did vnwillingly and with repugnancy of mind take the crowne vpon her, wh

                      as S.

                  Moreouer, wheras there are two parts and members of mortification,Two parts of mortification, internall & externall. the one internall, the other externall, the internall to mortifie the inward partes of our soule, both intellectuall and sensuall, as to deny a mans owne will, represse selfe loue, subdue our iudgemen

                      to the obedience of others, represse the passions both of pride, anger, concupiscence & the like: another part externall, that mortifieth the body and outward senses therof, making them subiect to reason by externall punishments of the body, as by fastings, watchings, and other chasticements of the same, which S. Paul testifyeth both of himselfe, and the rest of the Apostles that they praised the same, which being so, I would demaund of M. Barlow, to which of these mortifications doth a Courtly & Princely life lead vs, more then the state of a poore life. For as denying a mans owne will, it is far from Princes, to practice the same, who indeauour rather to haue their wills done, and that with reason: renunciation also of the world and subduing of their owne iudgments, seemeth not so properly to belong to that estate. And as for mortifying of passions, if they would attempt to do it, their flatterers would not suffer them, for that they would both say and sweare, that euery passion of theirs is a sound and solide vertue, and euery disordinate appetite a most iust desire.
                  And if you passe further to externall mortification, as often fasting, much prayer, long watchings, course apparell,

Is not soft & braue apparell, delicate diet, banqueting, dancing, masking, Comedies, loue-letters, and such other, more aggreable to that state and place? Of the first our Sauiour himselfe testifieth, Qui mollibus vestiuntur, in domibus Regum sunt; and for the rest that they were gratefull and familiar in Queene Elizabeth her Court, and more frequented by her selfe then the other, all men I thinke that were eye witnesses of the same will testify. Only there wanted to the world a Deuine, who by a new Theology should celebrate these Courtly exercises for good mortifications; and now is sprong vp M. VVilliam Barlow,
                     M. Barlow a Deuine for the Court. that hath taken the matter vpon him, & published it in print, making the very state and condition of life it selfe, of being a Prince, to be a state of mortification, and consequently also of pennance (for that mortifications be acts of pennance) wherof it doth ensue that Queene Elizabeths life was a penitentiall life, which is f

               OF QVEENE ELIZABETH HER FELICITIES, and infelicities. CHAP. II.
               AFTER this followeth another question betweene M. Barlow and me, about the felicities or infelicities of Queene Elizabeth, or rather betweene the Lord Iustice Cooke and me, who hauing vpon diuers occasions to the exprobration of Catholicke men and religion, whome she pursued in her life time, enlarged himselfe extraordinarily in her exaltation, calling her, The happie Queene, The blessed Queene, and the like: I was forced for defence of the truth, to examine somewhat the grounds of this felicitie. My words then were,
               
                  That the said Lord Cooke vpon the occasion of certaine words in Pope Clements Breue, where

Queene Elizabeth is named misera semina, a miserable woman (in respect no doubt of the miseries of her soule, litle respected by her:) vpon which wordes the Oratour triumpheth thus.

Elizabeth liued in al her life, & without wāt of all tribulation: which if it were true; yet is it but the argument which the worldlinges vsed in the Psalme, to proue their felicitie, that their Cellars are full, their sheep fertile,
                        Psal. 143. their kine fat, they suffer no losse, and then, Beat

                  And as for his definition of misery, by copia and inopia, store & want, it is a miserable one in deed, & neuer heard of before, I thinke, to come from any mans mouth, but his owne: it being ridiculous in Philosophy, and fit to be applyed to any thing that hath eyther store or want. As a wise man in this sort may be defined to be him, that hath store of witt, and want of folly, and a foole to be him, that hath store of folly

               Thus passed the matter then. But now M. Barlow doth constitute himselfe Aduocate for the Iustice, and if he plead his cause well, he will deserue a good

In which words,M. Barlow very forgetfull. I would haue you note first, that wheras here he sayth, that the Iustice shewed this, by many reasons, euident and demonstratiue, within a dozen lines after, he saith of these reasons, But if they be not concluding demonstrations, yet as least let them be probable perswasions, which is quite contrary to that which he sayd before, that they were euident and demonstratiue, so soone the man forgetteth himselfe. But to the matter it selfe, that albeit all these temporall felicities ascribed to Queene Elizabeth had bene so many, and so great, as Syr Edward affirmeth them, yet had it beene but the argument of worldlings, who in the 143. Psalme, did measure their felicity by their full Cellars, & were checked for the same by the holy Ghost, by teaching them that not, Beatus populus cui haec sunt, but beatus populus cuius Dominus Deus eius: & consequētly that Queene Elizabeth might haue these temporall felicities, and yet be truly miserable in that sense wherin Pope Clement so called her, to wit concerning the affaires of her soule, and euerlasting saluation: To this, I say, he answereth first by demanding, why temporall prosperitie may not be made an argument of Gods loue to Queene Elizabeth, and of her felicitie, for so much as it is scored vp for one of the Notes of the true Church by Cardinall Bellarmine, de Not

They said that the people were happy, that had these things, ô maligni, ô vaniloqui, ô filij alieni! Beatum dixerunt, cui haec sunt. O malicious and vaine speaking men, o strange children! they named that people happy that had these things: that which was at the left hand, they placed at the right, they call the people happy that had these things. But what dost thou say King Dauid? What saist thou, o body of Christ? o members of our Sauiour, you that are Children of God, and not aliens, what say you? Beatus populus cuius Dominus Deus ipsius, happy is the people that haue God for their Lord.
                  
Thus farre S. Augustine. Wherby may be seene his sense, & the sense of the whole Christian Church in his dayes about the meaning of this Psalme, which he sayth I corrupted by my exposition, although it were no other then this of S. Augustine, as you haue seene.
               And if you would see other Fathers to the same sense, you may read S. Hierome in his Commentary vpon the first Chapter of the Prophet Habacuc,
                  S. Hierome. where he reciteth these

temporall prosperities, as vanities bestowed vpon the wicked.
               
                  Arnobius.
                  Arnobius also in his Cōmentary vpon the Psalmes, after hauing mentioned the sayd temporall prosperities bestowed vpon the wicked, cōclude

                  ent, for the meaning of this place. As for example, S. Basil hauing touched the vanity of this temporall felicity, he putteth downe the reiection therof made by the Prophet: Alij quidem, inquit, beat

With S. Basil agreeth S. Chrysostome in his Commentary vpon this place of the Psalme,S. Chrysostome. where expresly he sayth, that the Prophet Dauid spake these words, quorum fil

                  Theodoret.
                  Theodoret also in his Commentary vpon the 72. Psalme expoundeth these words in the same sense.
They call the people happy that had these things, for that being deuoyd of truth, they were not able to discerne the nature of things, but did measure happynes by their delights, wealth, and power, and so did affirme them to be happy, that had these things: but those that are studious of truth, do say with the Prophet, Happy is the people whose Lord is Almighty God.

               By all which places and many more that might be alleadged, M. Barlow in his interpretation of this place of Scripture is conuinced to be one of those fily alieni, alient children, wherof the Prophet speaketh: and I am freed from that fond calumniation of his, wherby he sayth that I haue slaundered the holy Ghost, by writing, that the holy Ghost did scorne this argument of worldlings, who say, That the people is happy, that haue these temporall prosperities. For you must note that M. Barlow comming to answere my former speach before set downe, he maketh a flourish, saying: That my answere consisteth of three poyntes, first a shifting euasion, secondly a false interpretation of the Psalme, thirdly a slaunderous imputation of the holy Ghost. The euasion, he saith, consisteth in that I did hou
                     •
                  d, that outward prosperities are no necessary arguments of Gods loue and fauour, and consequently neyther in Queene Elizabeth. The false interpretatiō of the Psalme you haue now heard, to be the interpretation of S. Augustine, S. Hierome, S. Basil, S. Chrysostome, and others now mentioned. The slaunderous imputatiō vpon the holy Ghost, that he scorneth at such inferences, is proued by the same, to be no slaunderous imputation, but a true assertion. And if the word, scorne, do seeme vnto him vnworthy of the holy Ghost, let him remember the words of the Psalmist talking of such men:
                     Psal. 2. 4. 
                  qui habitat in caelis irridebit eos, & Dominus subsannabit eos, he that sits in heauen shall deride them, and our Lord shall laugh them to scorne: where you see both the words, irridere & subsānare in one verse: & yet further in another place:

                  ene, that the Lord Cookes definition of misery by copia & inopia, was very defectuous. Let vs see now, how his Champion defendeth him. First he entreth with a great flourish, that he will defend the definition by Poetry,
                  None soe bold as blind bayard. 
                  Philosophy, Diuinity, & cases of Conscience. But as commonly it falleth out, when M. Barlow would make any great o

                  tentation of his learning, he then most betraveth his ignorance, and rusheth vpon matters that he vnderstandeth not whereof he speaketh: soe here both the poore man stumbleth at the very entrance, and misseth as it were in the very termes themselues, especially about Philosophy, Diuinity, and Cases of Conscience, as presently shall appeare.
               But fi
                     •
                  st wee must note what obligation he hath to proue, and how far forth he performeth that obligation. I sayd in my reprehension of the Lord Cookes definition,
                     Lett. pag. 29. by copia & inopia, that it was defectuous in Philosophy, as fit to be applied to any thing that had store or want: what is the defendant bound to proue? no doubt but that it is a good definition, according to the lawes of Philosophy both in forme and matter: and if he proue this, by any one of his foure wayes, or by altogeather, I shall confesse, that he

hath performed the office of a good aduocate, but indeed he proueth it by neyther way, but only sheweth that copia and inopia may be found in one subiect, in respect of different things, which no man euer denied, for it were great folly to say that a man may not haue good apparell, and an empty stomacke, and another time to haue a full stomacke & want of apparell, and so in all other matters: whereof M. Barlow giueth examples first out of Poetry, as of Tantalus, Narcissus, & others that had copiam & inopiam, and were miserable thereby, which I deny not, or is it the point that he should proue, concerning a good definition, quae conuertitur cum re definita, and hath the other conditions before mentioned.
               From Poetry then he passeth to Philosophy, saying, that if I had read Epictetus in his Euchiridion, and those that doe comment vpon him, I should find it a Philosophicall conclusion, that those two contraries, (copia and inopia) doe make the greatest misery, when a man possesseth much & yet desireth more.
               Whereto I answere first, that although it be a Philosophicall conclusion, as well with Epictetus, as other morall Philosophers, that this is a misery: yet doe not they make it the definition of misery, for that there be many other miseries besides this.M. Barlowes weake Philosophy. And secondly though Epictetus doe call it a kind of misery to possesse much and desire more, yet not the greatest misery, as M. Barlow doth, for it is a greater misery, by his leaue, to haue nothing at all, & to desire very much, then to haue good store, and to desire more. As for example, if M. Barlow himselfe should haue had an ardēt desire from his youth to be Archbishop of Canterbury, euen while he was a scholler in Cambridge, and had no preferment, and should continue the same desire now, I doe not thinke that he will deny, but that it is lesse misery to desire and expect the same now, being already well furnished with the wealth of a good Bishopricke, then to haue expected the same with like ardent desire in his pouerty, and consequently it is not the greatest misery, when a man possesseth much, and desireth more. And this for his

                  Philosophy: now let vs see his Diuinity.

                  es, which implieth plenty, there is ioyned an insatiable eye, which argues want. Here now M. Barlow beginneth to shew confusion, and not to vnderstand well the true distinction of these sciences. In Diuinity, sayth he, King Salomon no meane Philosopher found. How did he find it? by Diuinity or Philosophy? 
                  
                     •
                  or here he nameth both: and if Salomon found it by Diuinity, what needed M. Barlow to add that he was no meane Philosopher? & if it be true which he writeth in the very precedent lines, that it is a Philosophicall conclusion, that the greatest misery is when a man possesseth much and desireth more;M. Barlow hardly vrged. then is this second conclusion, that it is a vexing misery, with satiety of riches, to haue an in
                     •
                  atiate eye or desire, a Philosophicall conclusion also (which is the very self same that was set downe before:) and consequently if that was a Philosophicall cōclusion, then can it not be properly Theologicall, for that one and the selfe same proposition cannot belonge to two different sciences sub eadem ratione formali, to wit Philosophy and Diuinity. For that Philosophy considereth her obiect according to light, & direction of naturall reason, Diuinity as it is reueyled from God and referred to God, as vnto the supernaturall & last end of all creatures, wherof M. Barlow making no mention, nor vnderstanding the difference as it seemeth, maketh the self same proposition to be both Philosophical & Theologicall, and that vnder the selfe same considerations, which is most absurd.
               And if he say that wee doe grant it to be a conclusion Philosophicall, & that he proueth it to be Theologicall, or appertayning to Diuinity, for that it is in the Scriptures vttered by Salomon, I answere, that euery proposition found in the Scripture is not of his owne nature Theologicall, or appertayning to Diuinity, for that it is neyther of truth reueyled not deduced from reueyled principles, nor hath reference to God, as he is the formall obiect of Diuinity, but may be

in it selfe Philosophicall, and knowne by light of reason, as wee haue sayd of this proposition,M. Barlowes wāt of Diuinity. that it is a kinde of misery to possesse much and desire more, which not only the Heathen Philosophers, but euery man commonly by naturall light of reason will discerne, and consequently M. Barlow though he straine the Scripture, therby to draw some semblance of proofe from the same, as you haue seene, yet doth he not proue it at all: and this third way of Diuinity is lesse then nothing.
               But of all other his fourth & last way by Cases of Conscience is notable. Let vs heare his words:Strange cases of conscience proposed by M. Barlow. 
                  And euen in cases of conscience, saith he, were they not those two contraries, plenty of good desires in S. Paul to do well, but want of ability to perform those desires, that made him to cry out, miser ego homo, miserable man that I am? To which question I answere, that true it is, that S. Paul complaineth in that place that he found a great fight and repugnance as other men do, betwene the law of his flesh (or stirring of concupi
                     ••
                  ence) and the law of his mind. Which if M. Barlow will call copia & inopia, he may draw any thing to the Lord Cookes definition: euen when as a man and his wife do fall out, there is copia commonly and inopia also, for he shalbe sure to haue copia of ill words, and inopia of peace and quietnes, and therby also some misery. But I would very gladly know why M. Barlow calleth this the doctrine of Cases of conscience, as if it were a distinct thing from Diuinity (for otherwise it would not be his fourth way of proofe?) where as we hould the said doctrine of Cases of Consciēce to be an essentiall part of Diuinity it selfe, to wit the morall part, that resolueth doubts of Conscience in practice: as for example when there ariseth some doubt about Vsury, Restitution, Matrimony, or the like, what in Conscience may be done, and what not, in this or that case, the matter is resolued by this part of Diuinity. But what is this to the example of S. Pauls conflict betweene sense and reason, flesh and spirit, alleaged by M. Barlow? had the Apostle any doubt or scruple of Conscience therin what he had to thinke or do, about these rebellions of the fl

In Scripture some Kinges that were vicious, had their faultes touched euer after their buriall, but no more, yet some are neuer named in Scripture, but their sinne is branded vpon their name, as often you may see of

Then he telleth vs, that in some places the ciuill Lawes doe permit some bastards to succeed. Item that she shewed well by her courage, and other Princely qualities, that she was King Henries daughter. Item that her selfe did so far cōtemne those slaunders published in print, as shee would neuer consent to haue them cleared, but rather scorned them. Item that Queene Mary also was disinabled by Parlament in her fathers dayes &c. And are not these strong argumentes to proue his purpose, to wit, that this proceeding of the Parlament and declaration made against her, was no temporall disgrace? Albeit for so much as belongeth to Queene Mary, all men doe know that her case was far different, for that Queene Mar

But first he doth not proue, or euer shall be able, any such demerit of treason to haue drawne on this rigour, but only by calumniation, which indeed is and hath beene the persecutors stawking-horse, to deceiue the simple, pretending one thing for another, thereby to oppresse the innocent: and secondly S.

this triall out of S. Augustines workes themselues? And if he dare not (as I know he dareth not, nor will euer accept thereof) why doth he here prattle out of S. Augustine, as though if he were now aliue agayne, he would allow the lawes of Protestant Princes made against that religion and Church which himselfe defended while he was lyuing? This then is another absurd shift of M. Barlow to delude his Reader. But there followeth another if not more absurd, yet at least lesse shamefast, for that the malice is more apparent.

Wherefore I went to looke vpon the two pages of the selfe same leafe, the one written before the Queenes death, the other after: but I could see no such matter so neere togeather, then comming back some foure or fiue pages, I found that which I suppose to haue giuen him the occasion of this fond cauill, for that the Author hauing dedicated that booke to the Catholiks of England, & in the Epistle Dedicatory layd forth at large the great af

                        Matth. 5. 
                     Beati qui persecutionem patiuntur propter iustitiam: Blessed are they that suffer persecutiō for righteousnes. And S. Iohn Baptist is acknowledged by all Deuines for a true Martyr, although he died for no article of faith, but for reprehending the incestuous marriage of King Herod, with more libertie of speach and spirit, then any such Prince-flatterer & base mind as M. Barlow would euer haue done in the like case, if we may ghesse at his vertue by his writing.

And wheras M. Barlow impugneth this by two cases or examples, they are but so many arguments of his owne ignorance. Let vs speake a word or

two of them both.
                  The first is of Absolom, putting the case that he was an Idolator, as well as a traitor, and that King Dauid after sentence passed against him 
                        •
                     or his treasons would acquite him frō death conditionally,M. Barlows two foolish cases. that he should renounce his Idolatry, and that vpon re

                           •
                        or Religion, or for treason? We will say, good M. Barlow, that he died rather for false religion, that is to say Idolatry, then for treason, and was the Diuels Martyr: and none I thinke can deny the same, vnles he be as ignorant as your selfe, as shall further appeare by the answere to the next example, which in effect is all one with this, to wit, that a yonger sonne should aspire his fathers death with hope to haue his riches, and that being condemned, his father should offer to saue him, if he would go to Church and leaue his euil life of following queane
                        •

                        icide against his father?
                  But here I would aske M. Barlow, why he leaueth out going to Church, which was the first part of the condition, and nameth only whore-domes? no doubt but the honest man, would haue the staying from the Church in Catholicks, and whore-domes seeme to be companions. But now I answere to his question, that if he meane by refusing to go to Church, such as is practised by Catholikes, for Conscience sake, and not to deny thereby the truth of the Catholicke faith, which forbiddeth to go to hereticall Churches, then dyeth he for the truth of his faith, and consequently he is a Martyr. But if he choose to dye for loue of wicked life, and whoredome, it is no cause of Martyrdome, and consequently he is the Diuells Martyr, as we said before of the Idolator. But as for Par

                  He bringeth in for proofe of the Queenes mildnes an Historiographer of Genua called Bizarrus, or Bizarro, which in English signifieth a Mad-cap, and he is brought in to tell vs certaine points of a Mad-cap indeed, to wit, the great moderation of her mind,

And for that you M. Barlow, with M. Sutcliffe and others do so often alleadge this Bizarro, as an Author against vs, it shall auaile much, both for your credits, and his, to tell vs where, when, and by what authority he was printed, for here in Italy we can heare of no such worke, although some search hath bene made for him, which doubtles we should do, had he bene set forth in these parts, and therefore we thinke him to be no Catholike writer, but of a bastard brood, and a Mad-cap indeed of your owne making. Besides that, how truly he writeth, not only all England, but all the whole world can testify: and to omit all other most cruell massacring and bloud-shed, the memory of the vnnaturall, and Butcherly Tyranny, executed vpon his Maiesties Mother, will remaine for a most rufull example to all posterity.
                  But M. Barlow not content with externe witnesses alleadgeth

also domesticall, saying: Your owne Priests shal speake for Queene Elizabeths lawes: and then cyteth out of the book of Quodlibets a certaine pathetical exaggeration in praysing Queene Elizabeth,

                  AFTER the former points of Queene Elizabeths lawes and executions therof made against Catholikes, and Catholike Religion, whereby she made her selfe most odious both at home, and abroad to forrayne Princes, yea to many Protestant Potentates themselues, that misliked such cruelty: I shewed, that as the naturall effect, and consequence in such causes is feare, diffidence, suspition, and vexation of mind: so grew the same vpon her very much in the course of her life, especially towards her latter dayes, when she was impressioned that not only Priestes, and Iesuites, who indeed did pray to God for her conuersion, but souldiars also, and Captaynes, and Phisitians did seeke her death,M.

others (sayth he) with more virulence, though with lesse violence, for penal charge, frame matter of hard iudgement out of the discourse it selfe: first in generall, that I haue broken the Canon both of religion and law, in reuealing a Penitents confession, which was with remorse, and priuate &c. Secondly in particuler, because in one part of my Preface I sayd, that I was not a penny the richer, nor a step the higher for the Earle, albeyt I celebrated his glory at the Crosse for Cales victory, and therefore hence they cōclude, that I now speake of splene, and preach for rewardes.

Let vs see what he sayth to the other cōcerning his Maiesties Mother,About the making a way his Maiesties Mother. and her making away. First he beginneth with a common place as before I mentioned, saying: If iealous suspition and feare extend it selfe to any; it commonly alights vpon the heyre apparent

or the successour expected. And for proofe of this he citeth the wordes of Tacitus before by me alleadged. And how litle this maketh to his purpose for excuse of the matter euery meane-witted-reader will cōsider. He goeth further therefore, saying:

                  Wherto I answere first, that the parallel was iust, as to me it seemed: for that as this treasō was designed by powder, so that of his Maiesties Father was both designed and executed. And as this was done by Catholickes, so that by Protestants: only this happy difference there was, that wheras the other had effect, this had not. And secondly I say, I did not reckon the death of the Queene his Maiesties Mother for a misery of Queene Elizabeth, if w

                     e respect the effect it selfe, for that I doubt not, but that the sayd Queene Elizabeth did hould it for a felicity to be able to achieue it: but I hould it for an infelicity, in respect of the cause that forced her vnto it, which was miserable feare, iealousy, and suspition. But what inference doth he make of this thinke you? Let vs heare him vtter it in his owne words: VVherby (sayth he) the Reader may iudge, how he would vse hi

Yt may be also that his Maiestie meaneth to follow the wisedome of King Dauid, who left somthing in this kind to be done by his sonne, which sure I am, that if his Maiestie were but three moneths abroad in the world to heare what is talked in other Princes Courtes and Countreys, he would exact perhaps a larger satisfactiō about this matter.
                  Now thē to speake briefly of Queene Elizabeths death, which of purpose for some pages I haue ouerslipt, to treat of these premises now handled that went before it:About the disastrous death of Q. Elizabeth. I sayd in my letter,
that after so long a life in such worldly prosperity

                        s, pleasures and iollityes, as hers had bene, it was a pittifull death to depart from this world to eternity with so little preparation or mention of God, as she is reported to haue vsed, wherof I sayd that I had seene a relation of a person of worth, that was present at all her sicknes and death, and had written the same not long after her buriall, which I sayd then I would passe ouer for breuities sake.
But now, for that I am so much vrged thereunto by M. Barlow, I meane to impart with the Reader the greatest part of the sayd narration, though not all, for sundry respects, but without any addition of matter from my selfe, as most sincerely I doe protest. But first let vs heare what M. Barlow sayth to that which already I haue written before.
                  
                     First he sayth, That if Queene Elizabeth at the first assault of her sicknes were silent, and solitary, phisicke will ascribe it vnto the nature of melancholy diseases &c. Then,

                        stantem mori, to dye standing; so Christian charity would inferre her retired silence to be a with-drawing of her mynd from her senses, for a more serious meditation or her by-past lyfe, and future state.
                  
                  
                     Behould heere M. Barlowes spirituall Rhetoricke or Rhetoricall spirituality, that can make madnes meditation, and silence or rather dumbnes vpon melancholy to be a voluntary withdrawing of the mind from her senses. Indeed her by-past life, and future state were matters that required deep meditation, yea contrition also and teares, if wee will belieue Saint Augustine, who both wept hartily, and repeated often ouer the penitentiall psalmes when he lay on his death-bed: and further said, as Possidius relateth in his life, that no man ought to goe out of this life without pennance, if he hath time to procure it: but alas it seemeth that Queene Elizabeth was not in that state of mynd or sense to procure it, or to accept of it, if any man had offered the same vnto her.
                  As for the other particulers, what she answered to her Doctor of Phisicke, that she did meditate; that she did lay her hands vpon the head of Doctor VVhitguist Archbishop of Canterburie kneeling by her, and saying Amen to his prayers, and sayd vnto one of her Ladyes wayting vpon her, that her mind was little of from God, and so gaue vp the Ghost &c. all this I say, for that it is much different from the faithfull relation of the aforesayd worthy person which was present and wrote the Story, as an eye-witnes, which M. Barlow doth not, I shall remit my selfe and the Reader to the sayd relation, which is this that ensueth.
                  Her Maiestie being in good health, one day a priuy Counsellour presented her with a peece of gould of the bignes of an Angell,The narration of the manner of Q. Elizabeths death. dimly marked with some small characters, which he sayd an old woman in VVales bequeathed her on her death-bed, and therupon he discoursed, how the sayd old woman by vertue of the same, liued to the age of an hundred and od yeares, and in that age hauing all her body withered, and consumed, and wanting nature to nourish, she died, commaunding the sayd peece of go

Now though she fell not suddainly sicke, yet daily decreased her rest, and feeding, and within few dayes fell sick indeed, and the cause being wondred at by a Lady with whom she was very priuate and confident, her Maiesty tould her (commaunding her to conceale the same) that she saw one night in her bed, her body exceeding leane, and fearfull in a light of fire. This sight was at VVhite-hall a little before she departed from thence to Richmond, and may be testifyed by another Lady who was one of the neerest about her Person, of whom the Queene demaunded whether she was not wont to see sightes in the night, telling her of the bright flame she had seene. Afterward in the melancholy of her sicknes she desired to see a true looking glasse, which in twenty yeares before she had not seene, but only such a one as was made of purpose to deceaue her sight, which glasse being brought her, she fell presently into exclayming agains

So in time growing past recouery, hauing kept her bed some daies, the Counsell sent vnto her the Bishop of Canterburie & other of the Prelates, vpon sight of whom, she was much offended, cholerikly rating them, bidding them be packing: & afterwardes exclaymed to my L. Admirall that

And some Lords mentioning to haue other Prelates to come vnto her, she answered that she would haue none of those hedge-priests & so none of them came to her, till after she was past sense & at the last gasp, at which tyme some praiers were said not farre from her.
                  The Queene being departed this life, the Lords of the Counsell went to London to proclaime his Maiesty, leauing her body with charge not to be opened, such being her desire: but some for some reasons hauing giuen a secret warrant to the Surgeons, they opened her, which the rest of the Counsell did not contradict. Now her body being seared vp, was brought to VVhite-hall, where it was watched euery night by six seuerall Ladies: who being all about the same, which was fast nayled vp within a board-coffin with leaues of lead, couered with veluet, it happened that her body brake the coffin with such a cracke, that it spleated the wood, lead, and cerecloth, to the terror and astonishmēt of all that were present: wherupon the next day she was fayne to be new trimmed vp, in so much as all were of opiniō, that if she had not byn opened, the breach of her body would haue byn much worse.

For S. Cyprian that holy Bishop and Martyr doth treat the same largely in diuers places, saying first, that an hereticke or schismatike that is out of the Church cannot be saued,

                  And as for the other point, concerning other sinnes, meant or mentioned by the Apostle, as on the one side I will not take vpon me to determine what, or how many or how great she committed: so on the other, considering

the frailty of mankind, the temptations of the triple enemie, the world, the flesh, and the diuell, the many occasions she had in her free state of life to fall into sinne; and that in the space of foure and fourty yeares at least, after the entrance to her Crowne, she neuer vsed the ordinary help of ancient Christiās for purging her soule, which the foresaid Fathers doe teach vs to be not onely contrition, but also Sacramental Confession, & absolution of the Church: her state, I say, being this, it must needs follow, that so many as belieue and acknowledg this Sacrament of the Church to be necessary to saluation, when it may be had yea is c

Augustines time, and hauing obtayned the same priuiledge which he tooke to be sufficient to demonstrate the true Church, to wit, that she is knowne by the name of Catholicke, both to friends & enemies, true Christians and Heretickes, according to the common sense of men (for he proueth that neuer heretical Congregation could obtayne to be so much as called Catholike, throughout Christendome, or to be knowne by that name) this thing, I say, being soe, we see what a dreadful preiudice this may appeare to be against the euerlasting saluation of Queene Elizabeth.

                      Queene Elizabeths euerlasting death: I doubt nothing but that the sayd Princes temporall life, would be held for very dangerous, or rather his death were very probable. Neither did I say any more of the spirituall death of Queene Elizabeth most likely to accompany her corporall. I beseech the mercie of Almighty God that it be not soe.
                  And here I might adde also another plaine & familiar proofe, out of the said ancient Fathers, and namely out of S. Augustine, to the end we may see how his Church did agree with ours, or rather the vniuersall known: Catholicke Church in his dayes, with that Church that hath the same name & notes in ours. For besides that number of authorities which I cited out of him before, as agreeing with other Fathers, that it is impossible for an Heretick, Schismatick, or an Excōmunicated person, dying in that state to be saued, he goeth further in an other place into more particulers; for being required by his freind Quod-Vult-Deus to set downe vnto him a briefe Catalogue, or enumeration of all the particuler heresies, that the Catholicke Church had condemned, from the beginning of Christianitie vnto their time, or did hould for heresies in those dayes; he set downe aboue fourescore, and added in the end, that if any man should professe, or belieue any of those heresies, or any other that had, or s

Now in this Catalogue or booke of heresies (which was also gathered vnto their dayes by Philastrius, and S. Epiphanius before him) S. Augustine setteth downe for damned heresies some that Queene Elizabeth did manifestly

                      earnestly recommended vnto him and other there present, that shee might be prayed for at the altar in time of Sacrifice, which S. Augustine not only performed himselfe, but in the same place most hūbly desireth all those that shall read his wordes, to pray both for the soule of his sayd Mother, and likwise for the soule of his Father dead long before, named Patricius.
                  
                  Now then haue we the testimony of S. Augustine, & by him also of all the Catholike Church in his time (for that he was neuer noted of errour eyther for thus writing, or thus doing:) first that Aërius was an Heretick, and consequently damned for holding that Prayers & Sacrifice were not to be offered vp for the dead. Secōdly we see by the fact of the holy widdow, that, that was the cōmon sense of the vniuersall Church in her dayes, for that she hauing liued first in the Catholick Church in Afria, & then vnder S. Ambrose in Millan, and sometime also in Rome, she would neuer haue demaunded this office to haue byn done for her soule after her death, if it had not byn the common known practice of the vniuersall Church in her daies: neither would her learned godly Sonne h

Augustine her Sonne may be thought to be saued, that both belieued & practised prayers, and sacrifices for the dead, then hardly can be saued Queene Elizabeth with her Chaplin M. Barlow (except he change his opinion) that neither practice or belieue that doctrine. I remit me to the carefull Reader, what force there is in this Argument.
               
            
            
               
               OF THE FLATTERY AND SYCOPHANCY VSED BY DIVERS MINISTERS TO HIS MAIESTY OF ENGLAND, To the hurt and preiudice of Catholicke men, and their cause. CHAP. III.
               AS during the life of Queen Elizabeth one great Witch-craft of Ministers was, for bringing her asleep in the bed of careles security, to intoxicate her braine with excessiue praises, and immoderate adulations: So, sayd I, they attempted to do the like with his Maiesty that now is, indeauoring to incite him dayly more & more against

Catholiks, & their religiō, by pretence of zeale towards his State & Persō, which no waies would they haue him belieue that Catholicks did loue or fauour. And in this poin

                  And I doe name this Minister (T. M. the yonger) in the first place among the rest, for that it is commonly sayd,The exercise of the Minister T. Montague. that his whole exercise is Sycophancy and calumniation against men of our profession, be they strangers or domesticall, and that among other deuises he hath this, that euery time his Maiesty is to take his repast, he is ready either with some tale, iest, scoffe, or other bitter lance to wound vs absent, and that he hath euer lightly some book & page therof ready to read to his Highnes, somewhat framed by his art to incense, or auert his Maiesty more, eyther in iudgement or affection, or both, and therby to draw from him some hard speaches, which being published afterward by himselfe, and others, do serue to no other end, but to gall, and alienate min

The second part also is false, for that men endued with many great vertues, may delight to hear themselues praysed, and their vertues acknowledged, though in their hartes perhaps (if they be wyse and vertuous indeed) they do scorne the prayser, when they vnderstand, that he doth it out of adulation for his owne gayne, or to hurt others. For it is to be considered that the nature of adulation which consisteth in excesse of desire to please, and delight the person which is flattered, doth not alwayes require that the thinges themselues should be all false that are spoken in such adulation, but it is sufficient there be excesse in the measure or manner of vtterance, or in the time, place

But if here withall the flatterers intention should be to gayne vniustly, or to hurt any man iniuriously therby; then should it be malicious and damnable flattery. And now whether also these circumstances did concurre in the flattery of M. Barlow, & his fellowes towards Queene Elizabeth, when she was aliue and towards his Maiesty that now liueth, I will not stand much to discourse: only I am sure, that the last circumstance, which of all other is the worst, to wit, of hurting Catholickes, neuer commonly fayled. So as we may truly say, as S. Augustine sayd vpon those words of the Psalme,

M. the yonger, will presently declare at large by the first institution of the word) signifieth a complaint or accusation of carrying out figgs from Attica, contrary to the law, and afterwards remayned with the signification of false or trifling accusations, or calūniations, prying into other mens actiōs, malicious inferēces, odious collections, & the like, wherof in that printed Sermon against the said Earle you shall find good store,M.

               All which and much more is set downe by S. Athanasius himselfe in a long Epistle of this matter, where he also recoūteth the bold speach of bishop Osius the famous Confessor of Corduba, who was one of the 318. Fathers that sa

                      in Ecclesiasticall affayres; remember thou art mortall, feare the day of Iudgement, keep thy selfe free from this kind of sin, do not vse cōmandements to vs in this kind, but rather learne of vs, for that God hath cōmitted the Empire vnto thee, & to vs the things that appertaine to his Church &c. All which speaches doth S. Athanasius allow, & highly cō
                  mend in the same place,
adding further of his owne,
That now the sayd Constantius had made his Pallace a tribunall of Ecclesiasticall causes, in place of Ecclesiasticall Courtes, and had made himselfe the cheife Prince and head of spirituall Pleas, which he calleth, the abhomination foretold by Daniel the Prophet &c.
Which speach, if old Athanasius should haue vsed to his Maiestie in the presence of all the rest, and seconded by others that sate the

                  S. Ambrose. should haue recounted their admonitions about the same, to their temporall Lord and Emperour Valentinian, as when the former sayd vnto him, as is extant yet in his Oration,
That he should vnderstand that he being a Bishop had greater authoritie in Ecclesiasticall

matters then the Emperor; and that he had a tribunall, or seat of Iudgment higher then the Emperour,

                      who was one of his sheep; and that more resolutly S. Ambrose to the same Emperour, when he comaunded him to giue vp a Church to the handes of the Arians: Trouble not yourselfe o Emperor, sayth S. Ambrose,
                     
                        Ambros. epist. 33. ad sororem.
                      in commanding me (to delyuer the Church) nor do you persuade your selfe, that you haue any Imperiall right ouer these things that are spirituall, and diuine: exalt not your selfe, but be subiect to God if you will raigne, be content with those things that belonge to Cesar, and leaue those which are of God, vnto God: Pallaces appertayne vnto the Emperor, and Churches vnto the Preist.
               
               And these three Fathers hauing thus briefly vttered their sentences (for much more might be alleaged out of them in this kind) let vs see how the fourth,S. Chrysostome. that is to say S. Chrysostō
                   Archbishop of Constantinople cōcurred with thē:
Stay o king (saith he) within thy bounds & limits, for different are the bounds of a kingdome, & the limits of Priesthood, & this Kingdome of Priesthood is greater then the other. Bodies are committed to the King, but the soules to the Priest. And againe: Therfore hath God subiected the Kings head to the Priests hād, instructing vs therby, that the Priest is a greater Prince then the king, according to S. Paul to the Hebrews, the lesser alwaies receaueth blessing from the greater.
               
               These foure Fathers then hauing grauely set downe their opinions, about this point of spirituall power not to be assumed by tēporall Princes, let vs imagine the other three to talk of some other mater, as namely S. Hierome,
                  S. Hierome. that he vnderstandeth diuers pointes of the heresie of Iouinian, and Vigilantius, against whome he had with great labour written seuerall Bookes, to be held at this day in his Maiesties kingdomes of England & Scotland, which could not but grieue him, they being cōdemned heresies by the Church. S. Augustine also vpon occasion giuen him,S. Aug
                        •

and in sundry other partes of his workes, said downe the doctrine and practice of the Church in offering prayers & Sacrifice for the dead, and deliuering soules from purgatory: and that the sayd Catholicke Church of his time had condemned Aërius of heresy, for the contrary doctrine: yet he vnderstood that the matter was laughed at now in E
                        •
                     gland, and Aërius in this point held for a better Christian then himselfe: yea, and wheras he (S. Augustine) had according to the doctrine and practice of the true Catholicke Church in his dayes, prayed for the soule of his Mother, & besought all others to doe the like, his Maiestie was taught by these new-sprong doctors to condemn the same, & neither to pray for the soule departed of his mother, dying in the same Catholicke fayth, nor to permit others to do the same.S. Gregory. All which Saint Gregory hearing, 
                     •
                  et vs suppose him out of that great loue and charity wherwith he was inflamed towardes England, and the English Nation, to vse a most sweet and fatherly speach vnto his Maiestie, exhorting him to remember that he sent into England by the first preachers that came from him, the same Catholicke Christian Religion, which was then spread ouer the whole world, and that which he had receiued by succession of Bishops, and former ages from the said Fathers there present, and they from the Apostles: and that the said ancient, true, and Catholicke Religion was sincerely deliuered vnto his Maiesties first Christian predecessor in England King Ethelbert, and so continued from age to age, vntill King Henry the eight.
               If, I say, this graue assembly of ancient holy Fathers should be made about his Maiesty, he fitting in the middest, and should heare what they say, and ponder with what great learning, grauity, and sanctitie they speake, and how differently they talke from these new maisters, that make vp M. Barlowes little Vniuersitie, I thinke verily that his Maiestie out of his great iudgment, would easily contemne the one, in respect of the other. But alas, he hath neyther time nor leysure permitted to him to consider of these thinges, nor of the true differences, being so

possessed, or at least wise so obsessed with these other mens preoccupations, euen from his tender youth, and cradle, as the Catholicke cause, which only is truth, could neuer yet haue entrance, or indifferent audience in his Maiesties 
                     •
                  ares, but our prayers are continually that it may.
               And now hauing insinuated, how substantially this little Vniuersity of ancient learned Fathers, would speake to his Maiesty if they might be admitted, eyther at table, or time of repast, or otherwise: Let vs consider a little how different matters, euen by their owne confession, these new Academicks do suggest, for that M. Barlow going about to excuse his fellow T. M. the yonger,M. Barlows diuision of Sycophā
                     cy. from that crime of Sycophancy which was obiected for his calumniations against Catholikes, in his table-talke; & trifling first about the word, what it signifyeth in greeke, according to the first institution therof; to wit, an accusation of carrying out of figges out of Athens, as before hath bene shewed: and then for him that vpon small matters accuseth another; as also for him that seeketh to recreate Princes & great men by pleasant speaches;
and finally also him that iesteth with a deprauing vayne; he telleth how that Maister T. M. may with credit be called a Sycophant in the three first senses, but not in the last (sayth he) for that Sycophancy must be clanculum, and without witnesses, but T.M. vseth this Sycophancy openly, euen by the Censurers confession, when his Maiesty taketh his repast, that is, in the hearing of many; so that the party being knowne, and the tale openly tould, he cānot be called a Sycophant, saith M. Barlow.
                  But I would first demaud of him, where he findeth that the word Clanculū,
or Secretly, must be conteined in the definition of a Sychophant, for that the first, & prime signification, and deriuation of the word doth openly repugne: for as M. Barlow sayth, in this place, such delatores ficuum, or Sycophants in Athens, were honorable Magistrates, that did accuse publikely: and secondly in applicatiō of the word, to a false accuser, & malicious forged crime, there is no such restraint, that it must be secret, by

any Author set downe, as may be seene in Henri

Barlow, wherin he pretendeth to be somwhat pleasant & to recreate his reader with certaine iestes, though with little grace, as you will see.

               And in this case I would demand of M. Barlow, what ground he hath to scoffe so at these three miracles here set down as he doth? to wit, of S. Denis

                  nes of the miracles done by him? Is it perhaps, for that they are strange, and not according to mans reason or vse of things that fall out ordinarily in the world? If this were not so, they were no myracles. What then? Do they passe (perhaps) Gods power to doe them? This he wilbe ashamed to say. What then? Hath he any testimonies of authors that auow the contrary, and affirme that they were not true? This I presume he cannot say; whereas wee on the other side, haue diuers Authors that affirme the same. And if M. Barlow, and his fellowes doe belieue many thinges of fact by humane faith, for that some one probable Historiographer either Christian, or prophane doth recount the same; with what reason can they scoffe at vs, for giuing credit to these things, that are testifed by many Authors? As for example, the myracle of S. Denis the Areopagite,
                  The myracles of S. Denys. of carrying his head in his hands is testified by Nicephorus Calixtus, a Grecian, in his second booke of Histories, and twentith Chapter, and by Symon Metaphrastes another Grecian before him againe in the life of S. Denis: and before

                  The myracle of S. Clement.The other miracle also of Saynt Clement the first who was cast into the sea with an anchor about his necke (but not with a milstone, as M. Barlow hath deuised) and that the sea went three myles backe &c. and the rest heere obiected by M. Barlow,

Gregory Thaumaturgus, well neere 1300. yeares agone, which is extant in his works from the page. 918. to 949. and S. Basil himself lib. de Spiritu Sancto Cap. 29. hath touched the same:

Heere then you see what ground & iust cause M. Barlow had to scoffe at these myracles, as he doth with like ground and spirit, at the myracles of the new mynt, as he calleth them, of the Lady of Hales, of the conformities of S. Francis, the life of

And vpon the same might any Infidell or Atheist scoffe at the myracles recorded in the old and new Testament, which to humane sense and reason are as impossible, as these here alleaged and scorned at by this Minister: as the multiplying of loaues, walking on the sea, a hatchet to rise from the bottome of the water and ioyne it selfe to a handle, with the like, which in another place I haue handled more at large against M. Sutcliffe, and Syr Francis Hastings.

In these partes I am sure, it is not to be had or heard of. What these good fellowes to make themselues merry and deceaue other men, may haue deuised to themselues in England, or els where I know not, but I suspect the rather, for that I do vnderstand that the Hugonots of France deuised a booke not long agoe, whose title was, Catechismus Iesuitarum; & set it forth as in their name, full fraught with all manner of errors, and ignorances, which being brought to Rochell, by them that had deuised it, they could not get it there printed, the argument was so absurd, and the fraud so manifest: and yet now do I see it often alleaged by Protestāt writers against them, and namely by Thomas Rogers in his late edition of 39. Protestant Articles: so as one way or other, these people

will euer make themselues matter for exclayming against vs, be it true or false, or neuer so maliciously inuented or peruerted.
               And here I would aske M. Barlow in good earnest, whether he do thinke indeed, these particulers to be true, which here so confidently he hath set downe about the yeares of pardon which he numbreth?

               Againe in his very first entrance to this Calumniation he vttereth two or three grosse vntruthes, which are inexcusable, when he affirmeth, that Popes doe pardon enormous sinnes, for innumerable yeares vpon sweet conditiōs. For first they pardon no sinnes at all by Indulgences, and much lesse enormous sinnes: for that Indulgences of the Church in Catholike doctrine, as euery man knoweth that hath the least degree of learning therin, doe reach only to the remission of temporall punishments due after the guilt of sinne remitted, and not of sinne it selfe, which c

Which be meere calūniations, and malicious maledictions, vnworthy eyther to be heard by his Maiesty, or to be refuted by me: as also that insulse insolency of the Minister, where he maketh his Maiesty to vse those odious words against all of the Catholike religiō, O Romanistae seruum pecus!

               And thus much about this point of adulation, wherunto also I must add one thing more, tending to the same effect, and much talked of at this present, both at home, and abroad, which is; That these new Maisters, of the little Vniuersity, and other their friendes haue perswaded his Maiestie, that they are valiant men in writing against their Aduersaries, and would performe great exploytes therin, if besides their Vniuersities, & Cathedrall Churches, they had some speciall Colledge of writers erected for that purpose, which men say is appointed to be at Chelsey,
                  Chelsey erection for writers. and that the matter is very forward: and that his Maiesty hath assigned therunto, both situation of a house and other great helpes; which if it be so, I doubt not but that it proceedeth from him, out of a most honourable respect, for aduancing learning: but I assure my selfe this will not serue, though there were twenty Colledges more applyed to this end, except his Maiestie should giue them

                  alshood, nor one vntruth but by another; and consequently their cause being such as it is, their multuplying of writers, and increasing the number of bookes is but to multiply their owne disgrace, whereof some scantling may be taken in the last two bookes (not to speake of any others) that haue gone

               And yet on the other side, if the said designement shall go forward, I thinke our English Catholickes will be glad thereof. First, for that it will honour not a litle their cause, it appearing by this, that the learneder sort of Protestants, do feele the weight of their weapons: for the besides the forsaid Vniuersities, Scholes, & Churches, they are forced to seeke yet further furniture for their defence. Secondly, it may be hoped, that forraine Catholick Princes hearing of this matter, will thinke themselues bound in zeale, and honour of their owne Religion to assist in like manner, for erection of some House, or Colledge, for English Catholike writers to defend the same. Thirdly it may in reason be expected that this little Vniuersity of Protestant Writers, will for their honour, and credits sake, deale effectually with his Maiestie, that the passage of Catholike bookes written in answere vnto theirs, may be more free, and not so subiect to losse, danger, and vexation,

Barlow needs defend it for a supreme height of Pryde in them, to haue hoped for such a matter, or made supplication for the same.

                  The clemency of his Maiesty (saith he) wrought in them that height of pride, that in confidence therof they directly did expect, and assuredly promise vnto themselues liberty of conscience, & equality in all things with vs, his Maiesties most best and faythfull subiects. And doe not you see how great and grieuous a charge this is, especially if you cut of the second part, as you must do, to wit,M. Barlow addeth to the text. 
                  equality in all things with Protestants his Maiesties best subiects? For this was neuer demaunded in the petition of Catholicks: & much lesse either directly or indirectly expected, and least of all assuredly promised to themselues. For then should they haue demaunded also to share equally with Bishops, and Ministers in their benefices, which we may assure our selus they neuer so much as dreamed of, or of other preferments in the common wealth, with that equality which heer they are made to haue assured themselues of.
               Their petition then was only for liberty of conscience as hath bene sayd, or if not that, yet at least wise some moderate toleration of the vse of that religion, which they had receyued from their Ancestours, from the first beginning of Christian religion planted in our English Nation, and continued in possession for more then nyne hundred yeares togeather, vntill the time of King Henry the eight, and his children, who made the first innouation, and by Regall power interrupted the sayd possession, wherunto the sayd possessors, and ancient tenants, though not presuming to demand restitutionem i

they might remayne with some kind of quiet and rest, for the vse of their said consciences in priuate,A most resonable and modest request of the Cath. which they promised to vse with all humility and moderation, without scandall, or publicke offence, whereof they offered very good assurance, both for this, and for all other dutifull behauour in their ciuil obedience, as became true subiects: yea adding further also, that they would inforce thēselues to continue the payment of that mulct, or penalty of Statute layd vpon them for their Recusancy, at such a resonable agreed sūme of money yearly to be paid, as his Maiesty should thinke conuenient: So as by this meanes, they might haue some externall peace, and quietnes from the continuall molestations, which now they suffered in regard of their sayd consciences.
               This was their supplication, & now why this should be called pride, yea the height of pride, & highest degree of pride, & further, the extreme height and celfitude of pride, & lastly, the summity and sublimity of pride, as M. Barlow calleth it, I vnderstand not. For if pride be defined to be an inordinate desire of excellency aboue others, I doe not see that here in this petition, either Catholikes doe prefer themselues disorderly before others, but are content with a far inferiour degree then Protestants: or that their desire in demaunding, is disordinate; whether we consider the same as it proceeded eyther from themselues to desire a thing so necessary to the health of their soules, or as it is directed to his Maiesty, their Prince, and Soueraigne, who is the person that may relieue them: and consequently, the laying forth of such theyr desires, by ordinate meanes of humble supplication, to theyr Lord, and Prince, cannot be called inordinat

               But yet let vs see briefly what reasons he frameth for this his consequence. For first, sayth he, it is impious against God to graunt any such liberty of conscience, for that God symbolically forbids such mixture in the linsy-wolsy garment, Deut. 22.

                     ted, Ergo, it is height of pryde in the Catholicks to sue for it: which second or minor proposition, for that he imagined we would deny, that it would be a staine to his Maiesties 
                        〈◊〉
                      to grant it, he goeth about to confirme the same,
by diuers weake, and fond reasons, not vnfit for his inuention, as, that his Maiestie should be contrary to himselfe, and shew too much weaknes and slipperines, hauing apprehended the religion, which he now professeth, from the cradle of his infancy, resolued in his conscience, mantayned it by disputation, enacted it by lawes, established it by Oath, & the like:
which are reasons quite from the matter. For the graunting of toleration vnto Catholickes, requireth not change of Religion in his Maiesty, no more then it doth in the moderne King of France, in granting the sayd toleration to his Protestants, or then it did in the Emperor Charles the fifth, when he permitted the same in Germany: so as M. Barlow here rather roueth then reasoneth.
               And further he is to be put in mind, that if it be a good argument, which here he vseth, that his Maiesty may not change his religion, for that he hath professed it from the cradle of his infancy &c. which yet hath not the antiquity of fifty years by a good deale, what may we say of the continuance of the Catholike religion in our countrey? How many fifty yeares are passed since that cradle was rockt? And why may not we make the same argument for any other sor

weight, or substaunce is in this Ministers words, who, so he may seeme to say somewhat, careth not greatly what it be, or how litle to the purpose.
               
                  I leaue his other reasons as triuiall, and not worth the answering, as that Queene Elizabeth would not graunt this toleration of conscience, that our doctrinall positions are dangerous, that if his Maiesty should graunt toleration, he should loose the loue of all his Subiects, & the like: wherof some are false in the antecedent,
as the second and third, for that our doctrinall positions truly vnderstood, are not daungerous to any common wealth but salutiferous: nor should his Maiesty leese the loue of his people, by vsing such

                  lemency to so principall a part of his people, not a little pittied by the rest, of most wisdome, and best natures. As for the first, though it be true in the antecedent, that shee graunted no such toleration, yet is it most fa
                     •
                  se in the consequent, that therfore it is height of pride, to demaund it of his Maiesty: no reason requiring that her actions should be a necessary rule to his Maiesty for his, they being no better then they were.
               But now we must see briefly what M. Barlow answereth to all my reasons before alleadged for defending Catholickes from the imputation of height of pride, in making this demaund, and humble petition to his maiesty, which I shall set downe, in the very same words, which before I vsed.
               
                  And surely, I cannot but wonder,

Wherupon M. Barlow maketh this comment, that by vnderlinge Protestantes,

                  how much lesse those who in poyntes essentiall, and fundamentall are seuered from vs, may not be tolerated? Wherunto I answere, that if we respect reason and iustice in this matter, there is more on the behalfe of Catholicks, then of Puritans,The Protestant hath Ecclesiastical power ouer Puritans. for obtayning this toleration, notwithstanding their differences in poynts of Religion were, or be greater: for that the Puritans came out of the Protestants, and therby the Protestant Church may pretend to haue Ius aliquod Ecclesiasticum, some Ecclesiasticall right vpon them. But the Catholicks of England came neuer out of the Protestants, nor their Church out of the Protestant Church, but were long before them in possession, which is the markable poynt so much pondered by S. Iohn to discerne heresy,1. Ioan. 2. & heretickes thereby, Prodierunt ex nobis, they went out of vs. And consequently the Protestant Church can haue no spirituall iurisdiction vpon the sayd Catholickes, and much lesse by right, or reason, can they barre them the vse of their Religion, as they may do to Purytans, that were members once of them, though they differ in fewer poyntes of beliefe. An Exāple may be the Iewes in Rome, who are tolerated in their religion, which Protestants are not, though they differ in more poyntes of beliefe: but yet for that they were in possession of their Religion, before Christians, and went not out from them, as Protestants did from Catholickes, they are tolerated in that place, and Protestants not.
               And hereby is also answered M. Barlowes last reason against graunting of toleration, which I pretermitted before to be answered in this place: which is, that if the cause were ours, as God be thanked he sayth it is theirs, we wil not graunt liberty to them, for their religion. But how doth he know that, seeing soe many Catholike Princes both in France, Low-Countryes, and Germany doe permit the sayd toleration, to diuers and different sectes? And if he obiect that in Queene Maries daies, it was not permited to Protestants in England, nor yet by King Henry the eight,

much lesse by the foresayd 3. Henryes that went before him, yet may the causes, and reasons be different now. For albeit for equity and iustice the matter do passe, as before we haue sayd, that no sect in England whatsoeuer, as of L

                     Matth. 13. they might pluck vp the other. So as these Catholicke Princes his Maiesties Ancestors, that did deny toleration, considering their kingdomes to be quietly setled in the Ancient religion of theyr fore fathers, did iustly and lawfully resist the new attempts of innouators: and iustly also may we affirme that if other forrayne Princes at this day, of the same Catholick religion do permit vpon other reasons liberty, or toleratiō of different religion: much more may his Maiesty of England do the same to his Catholick subiects, for the reasons that haue bene now alleadged. And so much of this.
               To the exāples of the Lollardes & VVickliffian Protestants, that made such earnest suite for toleration and liberty of conscience, in the dayes of three King Henries 4. 5. and 6. and tooke armes for obtayning the same, he sayth, that if any such conspiracies were, we de

                   then is the matter somewhat substantiall, & not only Ceremoniall: and indeed he that shall consider what the Purytan in this vnkind quarrell pretendeth agaynst the Protestant and his Church, shall see, that he striketh at the head indeed, or rather striketh of the head of the sayd Church, whether we consyder either the externall and ministeryall head thereof, to

wit, the Princes Ecclesiasticall power, and of Bishops vnder him; or the internall head metaphorically taken for the life, spirit, and essence of the sayd Church in denying it to be a true Christian Church, but only a prophane Congregation, without any spirituall power at all.
               This appeareth by all the course and drift of Puritan wryters, and bookes extant, of the differences acknowledged also by Protestant writers in their Treatises against them: so as to me it seemeth, not only a shameles bouldnes to deny it, as M. Barlow here doth, but a sham

                  full basenes also, and beggary so to runne after their enemyes,Basenesse and beggery of Protestāts intreating them to haue some association with them; whereas the other do both contemne, and detest them. For this falleth out not only in this case, but also with the Lutherans, whom M. Barlow and his fellowes, when they deale with vs, will needes haue to be theyr brethren of one and the same Church, fayth, and beliefe, for all substantiall poyntes of doctrine: Whereas the Lutherans on the other syde do both deny and defy this communion in fayth with them, and haue set forth whole bookes to proue the same, which were too long here to repeate. Yea Caluinian, and Zwinglian Ministers themselues are witnesses hereof, in many of their Treatises, as namely, the Tigurine Deuines,

               And conforme to these their writings are their doinges

and proceedings with them, where they haue dominion; for that they admyt them not to cohabitation, nor to the common vse of marriage betweene them, nor to be buryed with them, after theyr deaths, as they well know who haue liued, or do liue among them. And thus much for the Lutherans of the one syde. Now let vs see somewhat also of the Purytans of the other.
               And first of all this matter hath beene handled dyuers times, and demonstrated by Catholicke English wryters of our dayes, agaynst this absurd assertion of M. Barlow that the differences at this day betweene Protestants and Purytans are not at all concerning religion, nor of any substantiall, and essentiall poyntes thereof; but only Ceremoniall: and in particuler the same is conuinced, and made most manifest in the Preface of a late Booke, intituled An answere to the fifth part of Syr Edward Cookes Reports, where the different grounds of Spirituall and Ecclesiasticall power,Protestāts and Puritans differ in substā
                     tial points of religiō. betweene Protestants, Puritans, and Catholickes being examined, it is found, that their differences are such as cannot possibly stand togeather, to make one Church and house of saluation, but that if one hath the truth, the other must necessarily remayne in damnable error; which is euident also by the writings of Protestants themselues, especially by the bookes intituled Dangerous positions, set forth and imprinted at London 1593. and the Suruey ofpretended holy discipline, made as they say, by him that is now Lord of Canterbury, and Doctor Sutcliffe, as also the Booke intituled, the Picture of a Purytan, writen by O. O. of Emanuel, printed 1603. and other like bookes. But especially at this time will I vse for proofe of this poynt, the testimony of Thomas Rogers Minister, and Chaplin, as he styleth himselfe, to his Lord of Canterbury, who of late hauing set forth by publike authority, the fayth, doctrine, and religion of England expressed in 39. articles vpon the yeare 1607. doth in his Preface to his said Lord, hādle this matter of the differences betweene the Puritans and Protestantes, though partially agaynst the discontented brethren, he being theyr aduersary, but yet setteth downe out of their

owne words, what their iudgment is of the importance, and moment of the controuersyes betwene them,

                     ard them all, in defence of these matters: and that the articles of religion penned, and agreed vpon by the Bishops, are but childish toyes in respect of the other. So they.
               And will any man thinke or say now that these men doe not hould that theyr differences with the Protestants are differences in religion, as M. Barlow sayth, or that they are only matters of ceremonyes, and not of any one substantiall poynt concerning religion? Let vs heare them yet further telling theyr owne tale, and related by M. Rogers.
                  The controuersy betwene them and vs (say they, of the Protestants) is not as the Bishops, and their welwillers beare the world in hand, for a cap, or tippet, or a Surplisse, but for greater matters concerning a true Ministry, and regiment of the Church according to the word of God. The first wherof, which is a true Ministry, they (Protestants) shall neuer haue, till Bishops and Archbishops be put downe, and all Ministers be made equall. The other also will neuer be brought to passe, vntill Kings and Queenes doe subiect themselues vnto the Church, and doe submit their Scepters, and throw downe their Crownes before the Church, and licke vp the dust of the feete of the Church, and willingly abyde the Censures of the Church &c.

                   that their strife is for a true Ministry, & a lawfull gouermēt therof, expounding their meaning to be, that for obtaining the first, all Bishops and Archbishops must be put downe, & for the second, all temporall Princes, Kings, & Queenes must leaue their superiority ouer the Church, & submit themselues, and their Crownes vnto the same Church, to wit, their Presbyteries, as M. Rogers expōdeth their words? And is there no substantiall point neyther in all this, but only matter of Ceremony? And doth not the very life, & soule of the Church depend of these two things, a true Ministry, and lawful Head? Is not the power of preaching, teaching, administration of Sacraments, care of soules, possessing Cures and Benefices, absoluing from sinnes, spirituall iurisdiction, and all Ecclesiasticall Hierarchy deryued from hence? And are all these thinges only Ceremoniall without substance, or essence of religion?M. Barlow a bad Aduocate Doth M.

                  But let vs yet see a little further, how he hath aduanced his Maiestyes spirituall authority. Thus he writeth of his being Moderator in the Conference betwene the Puritans and Protestants. This difference (sayth he) about thinges indifferent, his Maiesty desirous to reconcile, vouchsafed his Princely paynes to moderate, & mediate. In which wordes, first doe you note againe his often repetition, that they were thinges indifferēt, to wit, whether his Maiesty should haue Supreme Primacy in Church causes, or renounce the same, and cast it downe, togeather with his Scepter before the Presbytery of the Puritans; and whether the Lord of Canterbury should leaue of his Lordship, and Graceship, and become a simple Minister equall with the rest? And so likewise M. Barlow himselfe to leaue the Sea of Lincolne, and title of Lordship, which none that knowes the humor of the man will imagine that he holdeth for a thing indifferent, or a meere Ceremony.
               This I say is the first Notandum: for if these things be indifferent, what need so much a doe about them? And the second Notandum is, that he saith, that his Maiesty did moderate and mediate in this Conference: which is a very moderate and meane word indeed to expresse so high and eminent Authority Ecclesiasticall, as sometimes they wil seem to ascribe vnto his Maiesty. For who cannot moderate or mediate in a Conference, if he haue sufficient learning and knowledge of the cause, though he haue no eminent authority at all to decide the same? But who shall determine or define the Controuersy?M. Barlow in the brakes. Here no doubt M. Barlow wilbe in the brakes. For that a little after being pressed with the free speach and deniall of S. Ambrose vnto Valentinian the Emperour,

                     ius, S. Ambrose refused vtterly to goe, yeelding for his reason, that in matters of faith and religion Bishops must iudge of Emperours, and not Emperours of Bishops: which deniall M. Barlow well alloweth, saying,

that Ambrose did well in it,

                     69. and sayd well for it, his fact and reason were both Christianlike.
               But suppose, that his Maiesty, had sent for the Bishops to dispute and confer with the doctors of the Puritan party in his presence, as the Emperour Valentinian did S. Ambrose & that they had refused to come, with the same reasō, that S. Ambrose did, would M. Barlow that wrote the Conference haue defended the same as good, and lawful? Or would his Maiesty haue taken the same, in as good part, as Valentiniā
                   did? I doubt it very much, as also I doubt, whether S. Ambrose if he had disputed, would haue suffered Valentiniā
                   (suppose he had bin learned) to haue moderated & mediated in that disputatiō, as M. Ba
                        •
                     low saith his Maiesty did in this. But if without effect, & that he could not conclude; who should giue iudgment of the matter? The Bishops? They were party, and theyr whole interest lay therein. The Puritan Doctors? They were also a party, and therby partiall. His Maiesty could not doe it, according to M. Barlowes doctrin in this place,A hard argument for M. Barlow to solue. if any point of religion were handled therein. Who then should iudge, or giue sentence? The Church saith M. Barlow in another place. But who maketh that Church? Or who giueth authority of iudgement to that Church, if the supreme Head and gouernour haue it not in himself? Do you not see how intricate this matter is, & hard to resolue? And according to this, as it seemeth, was the effect and consequence of this meeting, if we belieue M. Barlow himselfe, who maketh this question: Did th

                        •
                     ns, worke a generall conformity? And then he answereth: VVith the iudicious and discreet it did, (wherof M. Barlow was one) but the rest grew more aukward, and violent. So he.
               But all this while if you marke it, there is nothing said to the point, for which all this was brought in, to wit, why the like fauour had not beene shewed to Catholikes, for a Conference also with them about their Religion.

                     M. Barlow doth touch some number of reasons, as that our opinions doe touch the very head, and foundation of religion: That his Maiesty was perfect in all the arguments,

that could be

Which reasons being either in themselues fond, or against himselfe, I will not stand to refute. One only contradiction wil I note, that our argumēts being so weake, yet that it should be vnsafe to haue them examined; and that the long continuance of Protestant religion in England should make it indisputable: whereas more then ten times so long prescription of Catholike religion could not defend it, by shew of a conference or dispute h

               And finally I will end this with a notable calumniation, insteed of a reason vttered by M. Barlow, why this Conference ought not to be granted to Catholikes, for sooth: For that, euen in their common petition for toleration, they

And may not this Prelate now beare the prize for calumniation and Sycophancy, that out of so pious an antecedent can inferre so malicious a consequent? The Catholickes doe wish vnto his Maiesty both life present, and euerlasting to come; here a great King and there a great Saint:M. Barlows li

                  M. Barlow seemeth not to care much for his eternity, so he may enioy his temporality, by the which he himselfe gayneth for the present, and hopeth euery day to do more & more: it import

               And thus he inforceth me to answere him, contrary to my owne inclination, for repressing somewhat his insolent malignant speach, which is the most exorbitant perchance, virulent, and impotently passionate, that euer appeared in paper in our English tongue, for which I intend

not to follow him any further, step by step, and foote by foote, as hitherto I haue done: for it would require a huge volume, & weary both vs, and the reader with the impertinency therof. Wherfore I shal in that which is to ensue, draw the rest of this his Answere to certaine particuler heads for more perspicuity and breuities sake, wherby shal appeare how worthy a writer he is, and well deseruing his fee, that runneth into such absurdities, errors, ignorances, corruptions, and falsityes, as wilbe layd against him: wherin I remit my selfe, not only to that which is already sayd, but particulerly also to that which is to ensue.

               Well then this position & assertion is most certaine in all Catholike Scholes, as well by the groundes of Philosophy,A sinne to doe cōtrary to an erroneous cōscience. as Deuinity, that no man without sinne may do against th

               But now in what cases, and vpon what grounds, and with what circumstances a man may be bound to reforme or alter his conscience, either by direction or authority of his Superiours, or by contrary reasons, proofes, arguments and authorities, according to the substance and quality of the things, is a large dispute among Schoole Deuines, Casuistes, and Canonistes.
               For vs it is sufficient at this time to haue seene, that all generally doe condemne, as most false and wicked, this proposition of M. Barlow, that euen agaynst a mans conscience the Prince is to be obeyed: which proposition you haue seene before confuted. Now we must consider certayne shi

                  Euen agaynst conscience, sayth he, the Prynce is to be obeyed, vnlesse he that disobeyeth, can proue his conscience to be the same, that the Apostle describeth, a good conscience accompanied with true loue and fayth vnfayned. In which wordes you must note, that first there is contayned a very absurd shift, not voyde of impiety; and secondly much corruption and falsity. The shift is, in that when any thing is proposed to a man by a Prince or Superiour, that is contrary to his conscience, he byndeth him absolutely to doe it, euen agaynst his conscience, vnlesse he can proue that his conscience hath true loue and fayth vnfayned, which being a very hard matter for many men to discerne in themselues, especially the ignorant and vnlearned, he doth not only licence them

               For certayne it is, that the far greater part of Christians haue not sufficient time, leasure, learning, or commodity to make this proofe prescribed out of the Apostle: and then I would demaund him, what he will say of Turkes, Iewes, and Gentiles that haue not true fayth?

For that the Apostle describeth not a good conscience at all in that place, but only assigneth the same as a thing necessarily requyred, to the end and perfection of the Law.

               There remaineth then his conclusion, that for so much as Hereticks and Schismatickes also doe plead conscience for their standing out, and that there is no one article in the Oath offered, that can be proued to be contrary to a good conscience, and true Christian religion, therefore standeth the Apologers conclusion incōtrollable still, That the Pope hath prohibited English Catholikes to performe euen ciuill obedience to their Soueraigne.

                   Catholikes consciences, and to theyr religion, they are so many, as do any way impeach, or preiudice their religion, which are the most part in the Oath, as is knowne. Neyther must M. Barlow run to this ordinary shift, and say as he is wont, that their consciences are not well cleansed
                     •
                   and that their religion is not true Christian Religion, & therefore they ought not to haue scruple in sweating
                     •
                   for that now it hath been shewed, that it is sufficient for binding

them from swearing, that their conscyences doe tell them the contrary, which conscience to them doth appear good, and their religion true: in which respect the Pope that is of the same conscience and Religion hath defined it to be vnlawfull vnto them, to sweare against this their cō
                  science and religion, so long as it standeth as it doth. And therefore if M. Barlow will haue them sweare without sinne in this case, he must first make them Protestants, and so giue them a new conscience, and new religion, for in that they haue, they cannot doe it; albeit for temporall obedience, they offer all that may be exacted, at their hands by any law of Christian subiection to their temporall soueraigne.
               And this much may be sufficient for discussing of this point, Whether subiects may or must obey their Princes, when they command things against their consciences, which in my Letter I denyed. And whereas the Apologer did alleadg dyuers authorities out of Scriptures, Fathers, and Councels to proue the obedience of Subiects to theyr Princes, not only Christian but also Infidels, as to king Nabuchodonosor of Babylon, to king Pharao of Egypt, King Cyrus of Persia, my answer then was this.
               He alledgeth for examples out of the Scriptures,
                     Let. p. 51. Apol. pag. 22. that the children of Israel obeyed the King of Babylon, as also they exhibited temporall Obedience vnto King Pharao of Egypt;
                     Hi

                        r. 27. 12. as in like manner to Cyrus King of Persia: All which examples we grant to be true,

                        Esdr. 1.3.
                   and could add many more, both of the Iewes, and Christians that lyued peaceably vnder Infidell Princes in those dayes.
But let one example (as I said) be brought forth, wherin they obeyed them in points contrarie to their Conscience or Religion, and it shall be sufficient. We read in the Prophesie of Daniel
                     
                        •
                      that those three famous Iewes,
                        Dan. 3.12. 
                     Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, were most trustie vnto King Nabuchodonosor in temporall affayres, and so much esteemed by him, as he made them his vniuersall Gouernors ouer all the workes of the Religion of Babylon, saith the Scripture: and yet when it came to the poynt, that he would haue them for his

honour and pleasure,No obedience against God & a mans consciēce. and vpon his commandement, adore the golden Statua, which he had set vp; they forsooke him flatly, and said to him in the presence of all his Nobility assembled togeather, that they were not so much as to answere him in that Commandement, not would they do, as he had appoynted them.The like in effect did the ancienter Iewes do with King Pharao of Egypt; for that albeit in temporall affayres they obeyed him, euen in that tyme when he oppressed, and persecuted them most: yet in that he would haue had them stay and sacrifice in Egypt, and not follow Moyses their Spiritual Superiour into the desert (notwithstāding that the King had some cause perhaps to suspect their temporall Allegiance also by that departure, they being a potent multitude of people:) yet would they not obey him nor do as he would haue them, when they persuaded themselues that God would haue the contrary.

nor Tobie those of the Assyrians, & much lesse would he leaue of to bury the dead, though it were forbidden by Proclamation vnder payne of death.

                           . Mach. 1. The Machabees in like manner obeyed King Antiochus so long, as he commanded nothing against their Law and Conscience: but when he went about to force them to sacrifice, and to eate swynes-flesh, and other things against their Law and Conscience, they refused openly to performe that Obedience. So as these places of Scriptures alledged by the Apologer, do proue nothing for him at all, but are rather flat against him, and for vs as yow haue seene.
                  
               
               Thus I wrote then, now let vs see how M. Barlow ouerthroweth it. First as concerning the 3. Pagan Kings Pharao, Cyrus, and Nabuchodonosor, wherof I sayd the Iewes obedience vnto them was in temporall matters only, he sayth, that therin I do abuse the Reader, for that they shewed their obedience (sayth he) to be due, and performed the same, in matters of spirituall seruice:
                     Barl. pag. 161. wherat I thinke no man can but laugh, that M. Barlow is become so spirituall, as that he can make

those Infidell Kings to be spirituall Superiours also,A strange assertion. or at leastwise to haue spirituall power, euen in spirituall thinges ouer Gods faithfull people. Let vs see his proofes of so strange an assertion.
               
                  To offer sacrifice (saith he) vnto the Lord in the desert is an

                  Weake proofes. And why was that? Was it for that they held him for their supreme Gouernour in all causes Ecclesiastiacll, and temporall? Then they ought to haue obeyed him, when he would haue had them offered sacrifice in Egypt, which they refused to doe, for that their spirituall gouernour Moyses, though a naturall borne subiect of King Pharao,

                  ould them that Gods will was contrary: and as for their asking, and obtayning leaue before they went to sacrifice in the Desert, who doth not see, but that it was in respect of temporall danger, which might ensue vnto them, if so great a number of their vnarmed people should haue aduentured to depart without his licence. But I would demaund of M. Barlow, who sayth, that the people of Israel shewed their obedience to be due vnto Pharao, and performed it in matter of spirituall seruice, what manner of obedience was that, which came alwaies in the Imperatiue mood, Thus saith our Lord, Dimitte populum meum, Let go my people? And when he yeelded not therunto, he was plagued and punished with so many afflictions, as are set downe in Exodus for 9. or 10. Chapters togeather: & in the end what leaue obtayned they, but against his will, when he durst no longer deny them? Which appeareth, for that his feare being somewhat mitigated, he pursued them afterward againe. And will M. Barlow make this an example of spirituall obedience to temporall Princes, that was thus extorted? Or of spirituall iurisdiction in heathen Princes, ouer faithfull people in causes Ecclesiasticall, that was contradicted both in word and fact by Moyses himselfe? But let vs heare his second instance, for it is more ridiculous.
               
                  So, saith he, the commaundement of King Cyrus was in a cause

meerly Ecclesiasticall viz. the building of the Lords house in Ierusalē, and transporting thither the consecrated vessels. But who doth not see that these things as they were ordayned by King Cyrus were meere temporall, as is the building of a materiall Church,A simple Discourse for that otherwise, the Masons, Carpenters & Architects, that build the same, should be Ecclesiastical officers, albeit they were Gentiles. If King Cyrus had had authority to appoint them out their sacrifices, & to dispose lawfully of their sacred actions therein, as he had not, nor could haue, being a Pagan, and not of their faith & religion; then might they haue sayd, that he had beene a spirituall Superiour vnto them: but for giuing them leaue only to go to Ierusalem to build their Temple, and to carry their consecrated vessels with them, that had been violētly taken away from thence, argueth no more spirituall iurisdiction in him, then if a man hauing taken away a Church-dore key, so as the people could not go in to pray, except he opened the dore, should be said to haue spirituall iurisdictiō ouer that people for opening the dore, & letting them in, & that they in praying him to open the said dore, did acknowledg spiritual obedience vnto him. And is not this meere childish trifllng, & worthy the wit of M. Barlow.
               
               What definition trow you, will M. Barlow giue of spirituall power and Iurisdiction, therby to verifie these monstrous and absurd propositions, which in this affaire he hath vttered, partly by his assertions, and partly by his examples? Truly I know no other set downe by Deuines, but that it is a power giuen by God, to gouerne soules for their direction vnto euerlasting saluation, euen as ciuill power is giuen for gouerning the cōmon wealth to her prosperity and temporall 
                     •
                  elicity. And will M. Barlow say, that God gaue this spirituall power to Pharao and Cyrus, that were Heathens, and knew not God, for gouerning & directing the soules of the Iewes, that liued vnder them, whose religion or God they neyther knew, nor cared for? Or that Nero the Emperour, or Claudius had this spirituall power and Iurisdiction, vpon the soules of S. Peter and S. Paul, that liued vnder them in Rome, and were

their temporall Lordes and Princes? These thinges are so absurd that I am ashamed to exaggerate them any further, and therfore let vs passe forward to the rest.

                      of Niniue about burying such as were slayne, seemed to haue troubled most M. Barlow in this answere; and so after some discussion of the matter vp and downe, whether he did it openly or in secret, by day or by night, by stealth or contempt, he maketh this conclusion; Take it eyther way,
                     
                        Barl. pag. 168. sayth he, was his disobedience in such a cause iustifiable? No. Grauely resolued, as you see, and Doctour-like, but yet without any testimony, except only his owne. For first the context of the story it selfe hauing recounted the circumstances of the fact, in the first and second Chapters of the booke of Toby, to wit, how the foresayd King Senacherib sonne to Salmanasar being returned much exasperated from Iury agaynst the Iewes, for the euill successe which there he had, did promulgate an Edict, that such as he caused to be slayne should not be buryed, the Story sayth, that Toby notwithstanding this Edict and Commaundement, did bury them by night,The fact of Toby against the cōmandement of K. Senacherib. yea and left also on day his dinner, and the ghests which he had with him, at the same, for to fetch in the dead body of a Iew slayne in the streetes: and when some of his neighbous, seeing the peril thereof did reprehend him, for aduenturing vpon so great daunger, saying to him
                        •
                      that himselfe had bene commaunded to be slayne for burying men before, the Story doth not only defend him, but also commendeth him for the same; saying:
                        Tob. 2. v. 9. 
                     Sed Tobias plùs timens Deum, quàm Regem, rapiebat corpora occisorum &c. But Toby feating God more then the King, did take away the dead bodies that he found in the streetes, hyding them in his house and burying them at mydnight.
                  Secondly the Angell Raphael in the twelth Chapter discouering himselfe vnto Toby, togeather with the mystery of all his actions with him, doth manifestly shew, that these his deeds of charity, of giuing of almes, and burying the dead bodyes of such as were slayne, were gratfull vnto Almighty God:
                        Tob. 12.

When thou didst pray with teares, and didst bury the dead, and didst leaue thy dinner for doing this worke of Charity, I did offer to God thy prayer, and because thou wert acceptable vnto God, it was necessary that temptation should try thee.M. Barlow a bad Angell. Here then we haue the testimony of an Angell, agaynst M. Barlow, that is no Angell: and if he be, yet must we account him for a very wicked, and false Angell, if the other be a good and true Angell.
                  Now then let vs examine a little whether of these Angels deserueth most to be belieued, or whether for a mans saluation it be more secure to follow the one or the other, for that they speake contraryes. The one that this fact of Toby was not iustifyable, the other that it was not only iustifiable, but acceptable also, and pleasing to Almighty God, and that in a very high degree, as by the text appeareth. The one determineth as you haue heard, that Toby was reprehensible in that he obeyed not the King
                        •
                      the other saith, he did very well in obeying God, more then the king. How shall we know which of these two Angels is the good, and which the bad. M. Barlow will on his part perhaps say, that this booke of Toby is not held by him for Canonicall Scripture,The credit of the history of Toby. but only Hagiographum, a holy ancient writing, as the Iewes themselues do allow it to be, though not in their Canon of Scriptures: yet doth not this take away the credit of the Story, which hath indured, and hath beene belieued, and taken for true, so many ages bo
                        •
                     h before, and after Christian Religion was planted? And M. Barlow cannot alleadg one authenticall Author, or holy man before these our tymes, that euer sayd this Story was false, or not to be credited, though he receiued it not for Canonicall Scripture.
                  Secondly we see it acknowledged for Canonicall Scripture, and of infallible truth, not only by a generall Councell of our dayes, wherin the flower of the learnedst men in Christendome were present, I meane that of Trent:

                        Carth. can. 47. wherein S. Augustine himselfe was present,
                        Aug. 2. de doc. chrism. cap. 8. and subscribed thereunto; and in diuers other places of his workes, giueth the same testimony to this booke, as do sundry other Fathers ancienter then he, as S. Ambrose,
                     
                        Amb. de Tob. 2. that wrote a whole booke of the Story of Toby, containing twenty foure whole Chapters, S. Basil in his Oration of Auarice; yea the holy Martyr S. Cyprian also himselfe more ancienter then them all,
                        Cyp. de orat. Dominica & l. de mortali

                      and this in sundry places of his works, and after S. Augustine, S. Gregory, S. Isiodo
                           •
                        us, Cassiodorus, and others: wherby is euident, that in S. Augustins time, and before, this booke was held for diuine, and Canonicall. And therfore for a man now to venture his soule, vpon this bare deniall of M. Barlow, and his Consorts (for there goeth no lesse in the matter, his assertion being blasphemy, if this be true Scripture) let his poore sheepe of Lincolne thinke well of it, for other men will beware how they venture so much with him.
                  But now setting aside this consideration, whether it be Canonicall Scripture, or no; let vs consider a little further what holy men in ancient times did thinke of this fact of Toby,
                     
                        S. Augustines and other Fathers iudgments of the fact of Toby.

                           Cap. 13.
                      whether it were iustifiable or no. S. Augustine in his booke De cura pro mortuis habenda, hath these words: Tobias sepeliendo mortuos Deum promeruisse, teste Angelo commendatur. Tobias is commended by the testimony of the Angell, in that by burying the dead he merited the fauour of Almighty God. And the same Father repeateth the very same words and sentence againe, in his first booke of the Citty of God. Whereby we see what his sense was in this matter, both in belieuing the good Angell, and esteming that good worke of burying the dead (which M. Barlow by contēpt calleth a ciuil co

Ambrose, who speaking of this Edict of the King, that no man should bury any dead man of the Iewes in that captiuity, commendeth highly holy Toby for neglecting the same, in respect of that charitable worke.

And when about nyne of the clocke the sayd Centurion prayed, an Angell stood by him and gaue testimony of his good works, saying, Cornelius thy prayers and almes haue ascended vp before God: citò orationes ad Deum ascendunt, quas ad Deum merita nost

So the Angel Raphael did testify vnto Toby alwayes praying & alwayes working: whē thou didst pray togeather with Sara, I did offer the memory of thy prayer in the sight of God, & when thou didst bury the dead, and leaue thy dinner for doing the same, I was sent by God to tempt thee, and afterward to cure thee, & I am Raphael one of the sea

Where we see that S. Cyprian maketh another manner of accompt of the holynes and meryt of this worke, and of the truth of this Angell, then M. Barlow doth. And the very self same speach S. Cyprian vseth in his booke de M
                           ••
                        
                        talitate, alleadging this place of Toby, and testimony of the Angell Raphael in the commendation of Tobies fact, in burying the dead against the Kinges commandement. So as white and black, hoat and cold, or the two poles are not more opposite one to the other, then the spirit of S. Cyprian, and that of M. Barlow in this point.
                  And truly it seemeth that a man may gather by good consequence, that for so much as he condemneth that fact of Toby in burying the dead bodies of the Iewes in persecution,A great presumptiō of M. Barlowes piety. he would also, if he had bene there, not only not haue buried these dead bodies against the Kings Edict, but also neyther haue receaued the persecuted into his house, agaynst the commaundement of the sayd King. Nay he would haue rather deliuered them vp to the persecutors hands, and the like, if he had liued amongst Christians, vnder Nero, Domitius, and Dioclesian. And this is M. Barlows piety in respect of that of holy Toby, and S. Cyprian, S. Ambrose, S. Augustine, and other such sincere pious men, who both approued and commended this fact. Now let vs passe on to the rest.
                  After these examples of Scriptures there were alleadged by the Apologer sundry authorityes of ancient Fathers which shew the obligation that subiects haue to obey their temporall Princes, which in my Letter I declared no way to preiudice our cause, who both acknowledge and offer all dutifull obedience in temporall affaires, which is so much as the sayd ancient Fathers doe teach, and for that the sayd authorityes are cleare, for vs in that behalfe, I shall

                     As these places of Scripture (said I) alleaged against vs do make for vs, so much more do the authorities produced out of the ancient Fathers, for that they go about to proue

the very same point that we here hold, that in tēporall & cyuill affayres we must obey dutifully our temporall Princes, though Infidels or Pagans:Authorities of ancient Fathers. but not in matters concerning God, our Religion, or Conscience.

And do not all English Catholickes say the same at this day: & in all other things, that concerne not God & his Obedience, by rule of Catholicke Religion, they offer cheerfully to serue his Maiesty, acknowledging him to be their liege Lord and King, & inferiour only to God in his Temporall Gouernment? And how then are these, and such other places brought in for witnesse, as though they had somewhat to say against vs?

                     The other two sentences in like manner cited out of Optatus and S. Ambrose, the first saying: That ouer the Emperour there is none, but only God, that made the Emperour. And the other, That teares were his weapons against the armes and souldiars of the Emperour: That he neither ought, nor could resist: neyther of thē do make any thing against vs, or for the Apologer, euen as they are here nakedly cyted, without declaration of the circumstances: for that in temporall affaires, the King or Emperour is Supreme, next vnder God. And when the Emperour will vse secular forces against the Priests of his dominion, they, being no souldiars, must fall to prayers, and teares, which are Priestly weapons. But what? Did S Ambrose by this acknowledge that the Emperour had higher Authority, then he, in Church-matters? Or that if he had offered him an Oath, repugnant to his Religion, or Conscience, in those matters he would haue obeyed, or acknowledged his Superiority? No truly. For in three seuerall occasions that fell out, he flatly denyed the same,

which this Apologer cra

                  The first was, when he was cited by Dalmatius the Tribune,
                        Three occasions in which S. Ambrose resisted the Emperour his temporall Soueraigne.

                        ius, in the presence of his Maiesty & other of his Nobility & Coūsell, which poynt S. Ambrose refused vtterly to do, telling the Emperour playnly by a letter written vnto him; That in matters of faith and Religion Bishops must iudge of Emperours, and not Emperours of Bishops. And dyuers other doctrines, by this occasion, he taught him to that effect, as is to be seene in the same Epistle.
                  
                     The second occasion fell out the very next yeare after  in Millane, when the said Emperour, by suite of the Arians,

Ambrose the Bishop refused to obey. And when the Emperours Officers comming with armes, vrged greatly to giue possession of the Church, he fled to his former weapons of weeping and praying: Ego Missam facere coepi &c. I began to say Masse
                           •
                         and when the temporall Magistrate vrged still, that the Emperour vsed but his owne right in appoynting that Church to be deliuered, S. Ambrose answered: Quae diuina sunt, Imperatoriae potestati non esse subiecta: That such things as belonge to God, are not subiect to the Imperiall power. And thus answered S. Ambrose about the giuing vp of a materiall Church. What would he haue said in greater matters?
                     The third accasion was when the Emperour sent his  
                        Tribunes, and other Officers to require certayne Vessells belonging to the Church to be deliuered,
                           Amb. ibid.

                        ple of God could not be the right of Cesar: which we speak (saith he) to the Emperours honour. For what is more honourable vnto him, then that he being an Emperour, be called a Child of the Church, for that a good Emperour is within the Church, but not aboue the Church. So S. Ambrose. What would he haue done, or said, if he had bene pressed with an Oath against his Conscience, or any least poynt of his Religion?

                        •
                      that he hath nothing at all in substāce to say against it: for to that excellent speach of S. Augustine cōcerning the Emperour Iulian, he tri

                     eth exceedingly; first bidding vs to shew that poynt in the Oath which is different from true religion: which is a cauill, as you see, for it is inough if it be contrary to the swearers Religion. And wheras we offer vpon that speach as the subiects of Iulian did, VVe will serue our Soueraigne, we will go to war with him, and we will fight for him, & the like, he sayth, it is but an hypocriticall florish of words. To the speach and facts of S. Ambrose he is forced eyther to say nothing, or to speake against himselfe. For wheras I do make this demaund, Did S. Ambrose by saying that he could not resist the Emperour, and that his weapons were teares, acknowledge by this that the Emperour had higher authority in Church-matters then he? Or that if he had offered him an Oath repugnant to his Religion and conscience in those matters, he would haue obeyed; and acknowledged his authority? To the first he sayth that it is only extra ole
                           •
                        s, not to the cause in hand, and that he will handle it in another place; though euery man of discretion will see, that the demaund is full to the purpose, and ought to haue beene answered here. To the secōd he hath but a ridiculous shift: Suppose, saith he, that S. Ambrose would refuse such an Oath vrged vpon him, would he withall forbid others to take it? Surely no. But I say surely yea: for if we graunt S. Ambrose to haue bene a good Prelate, Pastour, & Father to his people, we must also graunt, that what Oath he thought pernicious for himselfe to take, he would haue forbidden the same to

haue bene taken by his people, if they had demaunded his opinion, as English Catholickes did the Popes, or els he had not bene a faythfull Pastour.
                  But what doth M. Barlow answere to the three instances alleadged out of S. Ambrose,
                     M. Barlowes shifting answere to the three places of S. Ambrose.
                      in all which he contradicted the Emperour, that was his temporall Lord, and denied to obey in matters, Ecclesiasticall: the first, when he refused to go with the Tribune, and Notary sent for him by the sayd Emperour to dispute, in the Consistory with Auxenti

                      the Arian Bishop, yielding for his reason, That in matters of faith and Religion, Bishops must iudge of Emperours, and not Emperours of Bishops. Which answere of S. Ambrose M. Barlow doth allow, and cōmendeth it much: & albeit we haue said somewhat before about the same, yet shall we presently add a word or two more thereof.
                  The second refusall of the said Father was, as now you haue heard, to deliuer vp a certaine Church in Millan
                           •
                        
                      to the Arians, at the commandement of the Emperour, alleadging for his reason, Quae diuina sunt, Imperatoriae potestatium esse subiecta, that such things as are diuine, are not subiect to Imperiall power. Which answere in like manner M. Barlow alloweth, albeit I thinke I may assure my selfe, that if his Matie of England should cōmaund one of his Parish Churches of Lincolne Diocesse to be deliuered vp to the Puritās, or Brownists, or other like Sectaries, and that his Maiesty should be so earnest, & resolute therin, as the Emperour was, sending his officers & souldiars to put them into possession, M. Barlow would not be so resolute in his deniall as S. Ambrose was; neither would he be so bold to alleage that reasō which S. Ambrose did,Feminine Supremacy more esteemed of M. Barlow then Masculine. that diuine things are not subiect to King Iames his power; including in the name of diuine things, the possession of this, or that materiall Church. Or if he would be so bold now, I assure my self he would not haue bene so in Queene Elizabeths dayes, whose spirituall Supremacy though femininae, seemed much more to be esteemed of him, then this now of his Maiesty, as presētly will appeare.
                  The third refusall of S. Ambrose to the Emperour was, when the said Emperour sent his Tribunes, and other officers

to require certaine Vessels belonging to the Church, to be deliuered, which S. Ambrose constantly denyed to do, answering as before hath bene set downe, That i

But it is a pastime to see how he chatteth about this matter, as though he would say somewhat indeed, but yet saith nothing, at least to the purpose. Let vs heare what he bringeth.

                        •
                     , how zealous M. Barlow is become vpon the suddayne for defence of consecrated vessels in the Church? What Vessels haue they consecrated thinke you? Or what kind of consecration do they vse therein? He sayth it is an anathema for any person not consecrated to chalenge them: the sacred Emperour, and King do demand them in this our case: if their persons be sacred, then in M. Barlows sense they are also consecrated, and they may demaund these Vessels, which as I said are very few in the Protestant Church: and if they had beene as few in the Church meant by S. Ambrose, it is not likely that the

Emperour would haue troubled himselfe so much in sending Tribunes, and other officers for the same.
                  But suppose the vessels were of like number, price, and value in the one, and the other Church. Yet I thinke M. Barlow will not deny, but that the manner of consecrating them was far different, which may be seene in the

Which difference I thinke the Protestants do not greatly obserue, in their hallowed Vessels. S.

                      that it was such, as it made it vnlawfall for lay men to touch them, which I thinke M. Barlow will not lay of his Communion-Cup, which all men take in their hands. But now to the question it selfe.
                  Do you thinke that M. Barlow would deny vnto King Iames that Communion-Cup, or any other Vessels of a Church, if he should as earnestly demand them, as Valentinia

If he would, what kind of Supremacy doth he allow his Maiesty in spirituall matters, if he may be denyed and disobeyed in these also that are in a certaine sort mixt, and in some part conioyned with temporall respects?
                  And truly when I do consider with my selfe, with what degrees M. Barlow doth descend and go downeward in defending of the Ecclesiasticall Supremacy of his Maiesty,M. Barlows declining in the point of Supremacy. bringing it, as it were to nothing from that high pitch, wherin King Henry the eight both placed it, and left it, & his children King Edward, and Queene Elizabeth continued the same; I cannot but wonder and admire the prouidēce

                     er the Church of England, no lesse thē of the Pope himselfe ouer his Church of Rome. But now of later dayes, and by later writers, the case seemeth wonderfully altered; for not only haue they taken away the name, & title of Head of the Church, which was treason by King Henries Statutes to deny, and many were put to death for not yielding therunto: but haue taken away the authority also it selfe, if we respect the substance, and shifting in words, to seeme still to retaine somewhat. Wherin among others M. Barlow seemeth eminent, and vnder a shew of defending the Kings supremacy, to take it quite away. For let vs heare, first how he handleth the question, about the Princes authority for iudging in cases of religion; which is the principall of all the rest. He both proposeth, and solueth the question thus.
                  
                     May not then, saith he, a Prince iudge in cases of Religion and Faith? No: not iudicio definitiuo,M. Barlows iudgment about the Kings supreme Ecclesiastical authority. 
                     to determine what is sound Diuinity or not and so impose that vpon the consciences of men for faith, which he alone defines to be so: but iudicio executiuo, or iurisdictionis he may, and ought when the Church hath determined matters of saith, command the prosessing therof, within his Kingdome
                           •
                         as the soundest and worthyest to be receaued. This is his determination; whereby it is euident, that he permitteth only vnto the King to execute that which his Church in England, to wit, the Bishops and Clergy therof, shall determine about matters of religion, which is no one iote more of power in Ecclesiasticall matters, then that which Catholicks do ascribe vnto their 
                        •
                     emporall Princes, to execute what the Church determineth: but yet with this difference of much more dignity, that they are bound to the execu
                        •
                     ion only of that which the Vniuersall Church shall determine, & not of their owne subiects alone, as it falleth out on the behalfe of his Maiesty of England in this case. In

which point also I do not see, how he can wind himselfe out of this maze, that must necessarily follow of his owne doctrine, to wit, that one should receiue from another, that the other receiued from him. As for example, if the Bishops being his Maiesties subiects, as well in spirituall as temporal affaires, haue no spirituall iurisdiction but frō him, as the Statute of King Edward doth determine: and on the other side his Maiesty to haue no authority, to define of any matter belonging to religion at all, but only to execute that which the Bishops do define; it seemeth that they receiue from his Maiesty that authority, which they deny to be in him, and so, that he giueth them the thing, which he hath not in himselfe, but is to receaue from them.
                  Moreouer it is euident by this doctrine of theirs, that the Bishops do make their Courtes & Tribunalls for matters of Religion, to be absolutly greater then the Kings, for that they do allow him no other power for Iudging in spirituall matters, but only to execute, that which they shall define and determine.
                  
                     And albeit for dazeling the simple readers eyes, M. Barlow doth in this place fumble vp a certaine distinction,M. Barlows fumbling. not wel vnderstood by himselfe, takē out of some Schoolmen, as he saith, noting Occam in the margent, that there be three parts of this executiue iudgmēt, the one discretiue to discerne, the other directiue to teach others, the third decretiue: which third he saith, is in the Prince both affirmatiuely to bind to the obseruing of that, which is so tryed and adiudged, and negatiuely to suppresse the contrary: and that this last is to Iudge for the truth; and the former of defining, is to iudge of the truth.
Yet doth all this reach no further, but to the power of execution of that which others haue determined, which may be called a power of impotency in that behalfe; for that therin he is subiect, and not Superiour, especially if it lye not in his power, either to execute, or not to execute, as he shall think best, which M. Barlow here denveth, saying: That he may, and ought to execute, when the Church hath determined. But on the

other side, if he haue power and liberty to execute, or not to execute, then is the other power of defining in the Bishops to small purpose. For that they may define, and he not execute, his iudgment being that they haue defined e
                        •
                     ill, and by that way becommeth he their Iudge againe, to define whether they haue defined well, or no. And this is another circle or labyrinth which I see not how M. Barl

                      will easily auoid.
                  I doe pretermit diuers other childish thinges that be in this speach of his, as where he propoundeth thus the question: as first, VVhether a Prince may iudge in cases of Religion, 
                           ••
                        d saith? as though these two were Sinonyma, and all one; Whereas religion contayneth many cases, as well of life, manners, and cerimonyes, as of faith; in all which cases it may be demanded, how far the King may be iudge. Secondly he saith, that the King cannot define, and determine, what is sound Diuinity or not, which is far from the purpose. For the question is not, whether the King may iudge and determine what is sound Diuinity or Theologie, but what is matter of faith, and what is to be belieued, or not be belieued by a true Christian within his realme. Thirdly in like manner when he saith, that the King hath only iudicium executiuum, or iurisdictionis,
                     M. Barlows absurde distinctions & diuisions. as though they were all one: whereas executio, and iurisdictio are two different things, & iurisdiction is more properly in that party that defineth, then in the other that executeth: for that the former commaundeth, and the second obayeth.
                  Fourthly his terme also of discretiuum ascribed by him vnto all Christians, to haue power to try spirits, whether they be of God or no (besides that it seemeth contrary to that of S. Paul to the Corinthians, who reckoneth vp discretion of spirits to be a peculiar and seuerall gift vnto some alone, saying, Alij discretio spirituum &c.) is nothing well applyed by him to iudicium execu

subiects to iudge of theirs: for that other wise there must needes ensue an inextricable confusion of trying, & iudging of one the others spirits. As if for example the Bishops o

                  Now then to conclude the matter, and to reduce all to a briefe summe, for so much as M. Barlow taketh away from his Maiesty of England not only the title and style Of Head of the Church,
                     M. Barlow hath marred the market of the Kings supremacy. which was giuen to King Henry, and confirmed to King Edward, but the Papall authority in like manner, for decision of matters, which was ascribed vnto them both by Parlament, and confirmed to Queene Elizabeth; and here saith, that he cannot iudge in cases of religion and fayth iudicio definiti

Gregory sent the same abroad vnto diuers Primates and Archbishops of sundry Kingdomes mentioned by him, but corrected first and reduced by himselfe, as supreme Pastour, to a reasonable lawfulnes, and temperate moderation: to wit, that those who had borne offices of charge in the Common-wealth, and after desired to be admitted to religious life in Monasteries, should not be receaued, vntill they had giuen vp their full accompts, and had obtayned publicke discharge for the same.

                           mus & Christianissimus Imperator omnimodò placatur: about which matter our most Clement and Christian Emperour is wholy pleased and content. So as in this S. Gregory shewed his pastorall care and power, in limiting and moderating the Emperours law, according to the law of God, though in temporall respectes he shewed him the Obedience, that was due vnto him. But what is this vnto our Oath? May we thinke that S. Gregory, that would not passe a temporall law of the Emperour, without reprehension of the vnlawfulnes thereof to the Emperour himselfe, and correction therof in the publication, for that indirectly it did infringe the liberty of Religious life, when men were called therunto; that he would not haue much more resisted the admission of an Oath, about such affaires, if it had bene proposed? No man, I thinke, in reason can imagin the contrary.
                  
                  To this declaration of mine M. Barlow beginneth his reply thus: But that of Gregory, saith he,
                        Barl. pag. 173. 
                     toucheth the very quicke, who as he thought his duty discharged to God, in shewing the reasons why he disliked the Law, so did he performe it very readily to the Emperour, in promulging the same immediately, according to cōmandment. Wherto I answere first, that howsoeuer it be, the quicke of our question is little touched hereby, for that we treat, whether an Oath offered against the conscience of the swearer, may be taken or not, especially when the points therof concerne matters of Religion: and here the question betweene S. Gregory & Mauritius is about the publishing of a law,Mauritius his law no

                     er respect. S. Gregory was most earnest with the said Emperour to be content to haue the said Law mitigated, & tempered as he had proposed the same; and so in the end obtained his purpose, as by his words now recited doth appeare.

Gregory calleth it, which he sent to Theodore to be giuen to the Emperour) by the words yealding of reasons publikly, which is far from S. Gregories meaning, as presently shall appeare.

So the Councell. And heerof would the Apologer inferre that this Councell of Bishops submitted it selfe to the Emperour.
                  But I would aske him wherin? To take any Oath that the Emperour Charles should propose vnto them? We see no Oath offered, nor mentioned, and so nothing here to our purpose. Wherin then, or why are they said to haue submitted themselues? For that, perhaps, it is said in the Preface of the Councell, that they were gathered togeather by order, and cōmaundement of the said Emperour. Surely it was hard, that so many Bishops, and Archbishops should be assembled togeather without his liking, and Order. But that the consent, direction, and chiefe Commission for the same, came from the Bishop of Rome, may easily be gathered:

               This was then my speach, yielding furthermore a reason, why I did not stand vpon the places of some particuler Councels alleadged, for that the discussion of this one made manifest all the rest, that they tended only to this end, that they proued temporal obedience in subiects towards their Princes, in temporal affaires, which Catholicks deny not, and so in effect they proue nothing to the purpose in hand. But yet it shall be good to ponder a little, what M. Barlow bringeth in against that, which heere I haue written. First he saith, that not only these Prouinciall Councels, of Arles in France, and diuers others submitted themselues wholy to the Emperour Charles the Great, in most humble termes, but the foure Generall Councels also s

                  VVhole Councels, saith he, submitted themselues in all dutifull reuerence to their Soueraignes, not only in matters of temporall affaires, but in faith and religion. And yet further in the very next page: The Emperour, saith he, that hath the sole authority to summon a Councel,

of great solidity. And yet I suppose that he could not be so forgetfull, or negligent as not to see, that all this is quite contrary to that which he wrote within three leaues
                     •
                   before, to wit, that in cases of religion and faith, Princes could not iudge any thing, iudicio definitiuo, to define or determine, but only executiuo, to put in execution that which the Church determineth.
               But now if not only the Councell of Arles, and other Prouincial Councels, but the first foure General Councels submitted themselues also for the validity and establishment of their Decrees, which are knowne to haue bene concerning points of religion and faith, vnto the Emperours Royal assent: so as whatsoeuer was decreed there by the Church (& this not a Prouincial or National Church only of England, but the whole Vniuersall Church gathered in those first foure Counc

Emperours then bearing rule, shalbe good and lawfull Councels, and all other Councels gathered for the Catholicks against these to be voyd, & of no validity. Do you see heere M. Barlows manner of writing? and how he plungeth himself aboue the eares in contradictions, without marking, or respecting what he said before, so he may say somewhat for the present?
               But do you thinke that he wil stand to this now? No. For that in the very next ensuing leafe, he being pressed by me to answere what submission that was, which the Councel of Arles made to Charls the Great for his approbation, and whether it were of matters concerning faith, he runneth quite backe againe, denying that Emperours haue any such authority.M. Barlows memory very short.

                  taine most euidently the contradictory of that he sayd before, That Councels were to submit themselues for the validity of their Decrees to the Emperours Royall assent, and that not only in temporall affaires, but in faith and

                     eligion: and that they only haue power to make good or voyde all conclusions of Councels: which contayneth manifestly power also to define: & it is but a shift to say heere, that it is not for the Emperour to iudge definitiuely, which are matters of faith or not. For it is not the chiefe question, which matters belong to faith, and which not, for that is easily discerned in general, but which opinions in these matters be true, or false, doubtfull, dangerous, Catholicke, or Hereticall in particuler.
               Wherin, forasmuch as the Decrees that are, or shalbe made by the Councels assembled, must take their validity from the Emperours assent, yea euen as they are matters of fayth and religion, and that without this assent they are vtterly vo

And this necessity driueth him to such contradictory speaches, not knowing well where to rest himselfe, as euen heere in these his last wordes, there is a notorious intanglement, if they be wel considered.
               For first he sayth, that it belongeth not to the Emperour definitiuely to iudge which are matters of faith, but to ratify by his assent, what the Councel had defined to be matter of faith. Suppose that some Councel had decreed that Christ was the Sonne of God, and equal in God

Barlows former doctrine inferreth? though heere he would seeme to moderate the matter; but indeed he knoweth not where to consist. For if no Decrees of Councels in any matters of faith or religion, haue any validity, without the Emperours ratification and assent, as heere also he doth insinuate, then must we needs allow also vnto him power to iudge definitiuely, and not only to execute, as before hath beene proued.

                      celebrated without the Popes Authority, and therby at one push ouerthrow the credit of al Councels, both general and particuler for the better part of 900. yeares after Christ. Wherto I answer first, that to be a fugitiue for the cause of Catholicke Religion, is no reproach at al, but a high commendation, warranted by Christes owne words, when he willed them that were persecuted in one Citty, to fly into another: and much more happy is it to be a fugitiue, then a persecutour. S. Athanasius in his booke de fugasua, of his flight and persecution, doth handle the matter at large, to whom I remit the Reader.
               Secondly, as for the summoning & gathering of Coū
                  cels, general or particuler, our controuersy is principally of General Councels, for as for Diocesian Synods, as they may be assembled by ech Bishop in his district, and the Prouincial Councels by the Metropolitan, which Protestants themselues wil not deny: so by the due proportion of good order, General Councels must be gathered by commandment or consent at least of the general Pastour,Generall Councels 
                        •
                     lwaies called by the Bishop of Rome.
                   though in States subiect to temporal Princes, good reason requireth that the matter be done in like manner with the approbation of the said temporal Princes, for the houlding of the said Councel, in this, or that place of their Dominions. And this was obserued in the first 4. General Councels, which were commanded to be gathered by Constantine, Theodosius the elder, Theodosius the yonger, and Martian the Emperours, by the assent and approbation of the Popes, Syluester, Damasus, Celestinus, and Leo: which besides other proofes of seueral histories is made euident by the last of the said 4. Councels, to wit, that of Chalcedon, where, in the first action, the heretical Archbishop Dioscorus was punished publikely, and forbidden to sit amongst the Bishops, for that he had presumed to call a Councell without the authority of the Apostolike

                     , say they, numquam sactum est, that neuer was lawfull, nor euer was done. And consequently this prooueth that all the first 4. Generall Councells were gathered by the consents and approbations of the Bishops of Rome, though with the concurrence also of the Emperours, without whose good liking, the meeting of so many Bishops in their States could not be permitted, as before hath bene said.
               But now here before I passe any further, I must make you acquainted with a solemne foolery and falshood of M Barlow, concerning Cardinall Bellarmine, for that hauing vttered the words before mentioned,
                     Barl. pag. 178. that Coūcels were to be gathered by the Emperours, and not by the Bishops of Rome, though he citeth no one argument for the same: yet saith he, this is a thing so cleare and radiant, that Bellarmine himselfe being dazeled with behoulding the euidence, euen as S.

Barlow. I was ashamed on M. Barlowes behalfe, and his folly was so radiant in my eyes (to vse his phrase) that I could not read them without blushing: for that in the Chapter by him cited, and in the other going before, Bellarmine doth proue most substantially by many arguments both out of Scriptures, Fathers, Councels, reasons, histories, practice, and examples, that it appertayneth not to the Emperour only or principally, but to the Bishop of Rome to call General Coū
                  cells, or at leastwise, that it may not be done without the said Bishops consent, and approbation first had, so as the very contradictory proposition to this, which M. Barlow sets downe, is found in these expresse words in Bellarmine,

why diuers generall Councells could not be gathered togeather vnder the Emperours, who were temporal Lords of the world, without their likings & consents. Not, saith he, for that a Councell gathered without the authority of the Emperour among Christians should not be of validity, as our aduersaries doe dreame (whereas S. Athanasiu

                   saith plainely in his epistle to them that lead a solitary life, Quando vmquam iudicium Ecclesiae ab Imperatore authoritatē habuit? when did euer the iudgment of the Church take authority from the Emperour?M Bar

And can this stand with that which M. Barlow here affirmeth in his name, that he shewes diuers reasons why it rather belonged to Emperours, then to the Pope to assemble Councells? Will he not blush, and be ashamed of this shameles calumniation, or rather forgery?
               As for that he obiected cōcerning the Graunt giuen to Charles the Great, by Adrian the Pope, to haue authority to approue the Election of the Bishop of Rome, and other Bishops and Archbishops, and to dispose of the Sea Apostolike &c.

I referre him to Cardinall Baronius for his answer in his Annales of the yeare 774. where he discusseth the matter at large, and proueth it a meere fiction, and plaine fraud inuented, & registred first by Sigebertus in fauour of the cause of Henry the fourth Emperour excommunicated by the Pope: which he proueth by many playne euidences out of all the ancient writers, for the space of 300. years after Charles his time, who neuer made mention of any such Graunt; as also the expresse testimony of Eginhardus, that was Notary to Charles the Great, and was alwayes about him, and wrote his life, and by diuers other proofes which were too long here to recite. Therfore with this shall we end this Chapter.
            
            
               
               VVHETHER THE POPE IN HIS BREVE DID FORBID TEMPORALL OBEDIENCE to his Maiesty of England? AND Whether the said Pope hath Power to make new Articles of faith? CHAP. VII.

                  plaint was made against the Pope,

                     7. for that in his Breue he did forbid temporall Obedience to be performed to his Maiesty, as a poynt against fayth and saluation of soules; & moreouer chargeth him with assuming vnto himselfe infallibility of spirit to make new Articles of sayth when euer it shall please him &c. my answer therunto was this.
I find no such thing in the Breue at all,
                        Lett. p. 61. as that Temporall

Obedience is against faith & saluation of soules: nor doth the Breue forbid it:Neither the Pope or Church can make new Articles of Faith. nor doth any learned Catholike affirme, that the Pope hath power to make new Articles of Faith: nay rather it is the full consent of all Catholike Deuines, that the Pope, and all the Church togeather, cannot make any new Article of beliefe, that was not truth before, though they may explane what poynts are to be held for matters of faith, and what not, vpon any new heresies or doubts arising; which articles so declared, though they be more particulerly, and perspicuously knowne now for points of faith, and so to be belieued, after the declaration of the Church, then before: yet had they before the selfe same truth in themselues, that now they haue. Nor hath the said Church added any thing to them, but this declaration only. As for example, when Salomon declared the true Mother of the child that was in doubt, he made her not the true Mother therby, nor added any thing to the truth of her being the Mother: but only the declaration. Wherfore this also of ascribing power to the Pope of making new Articles of fayth, is a meere calumniation amongst the rest.
               
               So in my former writing: now we shall examine what M. Barlow replyeth about these two points. In the first, whether the Oath do containe only temporall Obedience, he is very briefe; for hauing repeated my words by abbreuiation, that the Popes Breue forbids not temporall Obedience.
                     Barlow pag. 181. 
                  No, saith he, it forbids the Oath, wherin is only acknowledgment of ciuill Allegiance. But this we deny and haue often denied, and still must deny, and craue the proofe at M. Barlowes hands, who though he hath often affirmed the same, yet hath he neuer proued it by any one argument worth the reciting, which notwithstanding is the only or principall thing that he should proue. For that being once proued, all controuersie about this Oath were ended. And it is a strange kind of demeanour, so often and euery where to affirme it,A foolish wrangling of M. Barlow. and neuer to proue it. He addeth for his reason in this place: He that prohibits the swearing against a vsurping deposer, denieth temporall obedience to his rightfull Soueraigne: and sayth neuer a word more. But what doth this proue?

Or in what forme is this argument? For if vnto this Maior proposition he shall add a Minor, that we do so, or that the Popes Breue doth so, we vtterly deny it as manifestly false. For who will say that the Popes Breue prohibits swearing against an vsurping deposer? Or what Catholike will say that his refusall of swearing is against such a one, and not rather against the authority of his lawfull Pastour? Wherfore this proofe is nothing at all

                   If this be so, that I do grant the Popes Breue to prohibite obedience in temporall thinges, then will I graunt also that M. Barlow indeed hath gotten an aduantage, and some cause to vaunt: but if no word of this be true, and that it is only a fond sleight of his owne, then may you imagne to what pouerty the man is driuen, that is forced to inuent these silly shifts. Let vs lay forth then the mystery, or rather misery of this matter as himselfe relateth it.
               
                  The Pope, saith he, being iustly taxed for not expressing any cause, or reason of the vnlw
                        •
                     ulnes of the Oath, the Epistler saith, there are as many reasons, that it is vnlawfull, as there are points in the Oath which concerne religion, against which they must sweare. And is not this a good reason, say I? Is not the forswearing of any one poynt of Catholike Religion sufficient to stay the cō
                  science of a Catholike man from swearing? But how doth be proue by this, that I confesse the Breue to forbid temporall Obedience? Do you marke, I pray you, his inference, and consider his acumen.
                  M. Barlowes acumen.
                   
                  But there is no one poynt (sayth he) in the Oath, that doth not so, to wit, that doth not concerne Religion, euen that first Article which meerely toucheth ciuill obedience. I do sweare before God, that King Iames is the lawfull King of this Realme &c. Ergo, I do grant that the Breue forbiddeth the swearing to all the Articles, and consequently leaueth no Obedience, ciuill or temporall.
               
                  But do not you see how he contradicteth himselfe in the selfe same line, when he sayth that there is no one point that concerneth not religion, euen the very first Article, that toucheth meerly ciuill obedience? For if it touch only and meerly ciuill obedience, 
                     •
                  hen doth it not touch religiō in our sense. For that we do distinguish these two, deuiding the Oath into two seuerall parts, the one conteyning points of temporall obedience, for acknowledging the right of his Maiesty in his Crownes; the other concerning points of Catholike Religion, belonging to the Popes Authority. To the first wherof, we refuse not to sweare, but only against the second. And now M. Barlow sayth,M. Barlowes cō
                     tradictiō. that all concerne religion, and consequently we grant that the Popes Breue alloweth no temporall obedience, but denieth all. And is not this a worthy dispute? But let vs passe to the second question, whether the Pope or Church, hath authority to make new Articles of faith, as the Apologer obiected.
               And first to my declaration before set downe to the negatiue part, that the Catholicke Church pre

Whereto I answere, that Doctor Stapleton sayth only, that as the ancyent Christian Church had authority vpon due examination by instinct of the holy Ghost to receaue into the Canon of deuine Bookes some that were not admitted before, as for example the Epistles of S. Iames, the two bookes of Machabees, the Epistle of Iude, and diuers others,

               So teacheth Doctor Stapleton, and the reason of his saying is, for that the authority of the Church is the same now, & shalbe vnto the worlds end, as it was in the first ages to iudge of Scriptures, when occasion is offered. And if the Church should admit any such booke now into the Canon of holy Scriptures, which was not held for Scripture before, (which yet is a case not like to fall out) then should no
                     •
                   this booke be made Scripture by the Church, but only declared to be such, which was so from the beginning, though not so knowne & declared. So as the Church in this case should not giue infallibility of truth vnto the booke, but only testimony by instinct of the holy Ghost, that this booke was such from the beginning, though not so accepted. So as you must note two cogging tricks of M. Barlow in cyting Doctour Stapletons words, first to conceale his first condition, Si id ei Spiritus Sanctus suggereret, if the holy Ghost should suggest the same vnto the Church: and then these other two conditions, if it were written in the time of the Apostles,M. Barlowes fidelity. and neuer reiected by the Church: which omissions were made by M. Barlow of purpose, to make M. Doctour Stapletons speach to appeare more naked and improbable: but indeed it was to keep his old custome, which is neuer commonly to relate things truly in all respects, in any citation whatsoeuer.
               His second obiection is out of Bishop Fisher, VVho sayth quoth he, that whatsoeuer the Pope with a Councell deliuereth vs to be belieued, that is to be receiued as an Article of fayth: which we graunting to be true, do ad only this, that it is to be vnderstood according to our former declaration, and as the Bishop himselfe expoundeth it,

                  or that it did declare it to be true, and to haue bene deliuered by God, and this by direction of the holy Ghost, promised by our Sauiour to the Church.B Fisher abused. So sayth Bishop Fisher. Here now you see that neyther the Church, nor the Pope Head therof do pretend to make any new Article of fayth that was not in it selfe an article of fayth before (yea and so belieued also fide implicita, by implyed fayth) in the faith of the Church: but only the intention of the Church is to declare it to haue byn such from the beginning, though not so knowne or declared, and therfore men were not bound to belieue it fide explicita, by expresse fayth, as now they are, after the Churches definition, and declaration therof.
               And that this is the common sense of all Catholicke Deuines, according to my former wordes, that the Pope and all the Church togeather cannot make any new Article of beliefe, that was not truth before, (at which assertion of mine M. Barlow maketh much adoe, as though it were false) is proued among other learned men of our dayes by Gregorius de Valentia, whose wordes are; that it is Sententia communis Theologorum,

And his whole discourse founded vpon Scriptures, Fathers, Councells and other arguments consisteth in this, that as whatsoeuer is now belieued by the Church for matter of fayth, was in substance belieued before, in all other precedent ages vnto Christes time actu fidei implicito, by an implyed act of fayth, that is to say, the belieuing in generall whatsoeuer the Church belieued: so many thinges are now belieued by the Church, actu fidei explicito, by expresse fayth, which were not so belieued before, for that the Church frō time to time hath had authority to explaine matters more clearly and expresly, which before were belieued by an implied faith only. As for example, the first Councell of Nice though it determined nothing for the p

And so in like manner the other Articles of faith and explications therof made by the subsequent Councels, about the vnity of the Person & differēt Natures in Christ, & that his Mother should be called the Mother of God, were belieued implicitè, by those of the Councel of Nyce, and consequently were then also Articles of faith, though they were not belieued by them explicitè, as we are bound to do, after the explication made by the Church. Let vs conclude therfore with Bishop Fi

Thus Bishop Fisher (whome you see how impertinently M. Barlow alleadgeth against my assertion) saith the very same that I do. Let vs go forward.
               Thirdly then he obiecteth S. Thomas of Aquine,

And he sayth it belongeth to the Pope as Head of the Church. And what is this against me? Did not S. Athanasius also set forth his Creed, though he were not Pope, with addition of many Articles for explanations sake, which were not expressely in the Apostles Creed, though in substāce of truth they were nothing different? Did not diuers Councells set forth Credes with sundry explanations that were not before? All which standeth vpon this ground so much pondered by

as whatsoeuer is, or hath, or shalbe added afterward by the said Church, are only explications of that first reueiled truth: and the childish babling here of M. Barlow to the cō
                  trary, is to no purpose at al, for he citeth diuers authors for that which we deny not, but yet alwaies commonly with addition of some vntruth of his owne, as heere he alleadgeth out of the Iesuit Azor, that it belongeth vnto the Pope to define Dogmata fidei,

               So in like manner he citeth Suarez to affirme, That th

                  without any expresse reuelation from God; which though in some part it be true, for that the ordinary assistance of the holy Ghost to the Church, may giue sufficient direction for the Church so to determine: yet are there diuers wilful corruptions here to be discouered, in these few words of M.

But let vs see how egregiously he doth abuse the learned writer Azorius, in making him the Author of these absurdities about swearing, which here he setteth downe, as our doctrine, if a man sweare vnwillingly, saith he, it is vnto him (according to the Papists Doctrine) as if he had not sworne at al.

Barlow here citeth. And in another place speaking of an Oath extorted by feare or death, as to a thiefe vpon the way, or the like, which no man will deny to be vnwillingly made, he answereth in these words:

                  OF CERTAINE OTHER Fraudulent, and vntrue dealings of M. Barlow, vnto the end of this Paragraph: with a notorious abuse in alleadging S. Thomas of Aquine his Authority. §. II.
                  VVHereas often and eager inuectiues are made by M. Barlow against the Pope and Cardinall Bellarmine, and all others, that do seeme in any sort to exhort the Catholickes of England to stand for their consciences, and to suffer rather whatsoeuer losses, hurtes, or dangers may happen to their liues, liberty, goods, or other temporall affaires, then to preiudice any point of their religion, M. Barlow terming these exhortations not only needlesse and vayne (there being no persecution at al against the Catholickes) but that they do tend in like manner to open disobedience against their temporall Princes, and so may iustly be cause of their ruyne indeed; my answere was,

For why should it be more damnable then, and indispensable to deliuer vp a Bible, or new Testament, for example sake, when the Emperour commanded it, then now to sweare an Oath against our conscience and Religion, when our Temporall Prince exacteth it? For that this perhaps, is called the Oath of Allegiance? who knoweth not, that the fayrest title is put vpon the fowlest matter, when it is

                  Against this my speach M. Barlow first doth trifle, affirmimg me to say, that in the consciences of Catholicks it is as vnlawfull to sweare Allegiance vnto his Maiestie their naturall and rightfull Soueraigne, as to sacrifice to Idols. Which is a meer cauill indeed, for first I do not say, that it is vnlawfull at all to sweare Allegiance to their naturall Soueraigne, as often hath bene told him:M. Barlows slander without end. but he

                     uer stayeth his tongue from repeating the contrary againe without end. The vnlawfulnes consisteth in swearing that for Allegiance, which appertaineth not to humaine and temporal Allegiance, but diuine Allegiance also, in keeping our consciences vnspotted before Almighty God. Secondly my comparison was not so much in the thinges themselues, to wit, swearing and sacrificing, or to determine which of these is the greatest sinne in it se

                     ule of taking away, or diminishing the obligation of conscience in obeying the prohibition; I did alleadg the other example of giuing vp diuine bookes vnto the persecutors, when they demaunded them, and might haue alleadged many other examples to the like purpose, as namely the

                  And this is the Diuinity that M. Barlow scoffeth at, & saith he will not iudge of it, for it is our owne. And I say that the Diui

                     .
                  But now let vs see the truth of M. Barlow in relating this resolution of S. Thomas. First he cutteth of the words, nisi forè per accidens, which do alter the whole case, and 
                        •
                     ayth, that their Angelicall Doctour telleth them, that in vnlawf

                           •
                        or auoyding scandall and perill: wheras S. Thomas sayth, non te

                        , that they are not bound to obey their Princes, if they commaund vniust things.
                  Secondly M. Barlow distinguisheth not, when vnlawfull things are commaunded, whether they be vnlawfull only vnto the Prince that cōmaundeth, or to the subiect in like manner, to whom they are commaunded. And it may be that the Ministers head conceaued not the distinction, or if he did, he concealed it by guile and fraud, for the thing importeth much to the resolution of the case: for when the thing commaunded is vnlawfull only to the commaunder,M. Barlowes ignorance or malice more declared. as in the former example, when he commaundeth me to giue halfe of my goods wrongfully; then may I out of prudence, as hath bene sayd, for auoyding of greater euils, obey that vniust commaundment: but if the thing commaunded should be vnlawfull, not only to the Prince to cōmaund, but to me also to performe, as to do another man iniury, or to endanger my owne soule, or to offend God by any sin whatsoeuer, then may not I according to S. Thomas his doctrine, for auoyding any scandall or perill whatsoeuer per

Wherupon some learned men at home being different in opinions, the case was consulted abroad, where all agreed (as before hath byn shewed) that it could not be taken wholy with safety of conscience, and so also the Pope declared the case by two seuerall Breues.In the meane space it happened, that M. Blackwell being taken, was committed to prison, and soone after, as he had byn of opinion before, that the said Oath might be taken as it lay in a certayne sense; so it being offered vnto him, he tooke it himselfe. Which thing being noysed abroad, and the fact generally misliked by all sortes of Catholicke people in other Realmes, as offensiue, and scandalous in regard of his place and person, so much respected by them; Cardinall Bellarmine,

was of Prelacy, and Pastorall Charge, ought to stand fir

               This was the Preface vsed before to this third Part. To which M. Barlow hauing very little or nothing to say, seeketh to spend time in idle talke. For thus he beginneth:

                  As if the Apologers answere, saith he,

               Next to this he beginneth against me thus:
                     Barl. pag. 202. 
                  This Epistler s
                        •
                     yth, that Cardinall Bellarmine taketh the Oath to be compounded of lawfull and vnlawfull clauses, wheras the Cardinall saith plainly,

though it be so tempered and modified, yet is it wholy vnlawfull: whi
                        ••
                      is as much to say, as there is not a lawfull clause in it. So he: & this me thinks is to great an vntruth to begin withal.A great vntruth to begin wi
                        •
                     h all. For that according to art he should goe by order and degree, and if he begin with such wilfull escapes as these are, what wil he doe before he come to the end? Cardinall Bellarmine doth not only not say this, which he imposeth vpon him, but sayth the quite contrary, to wit: Vt Iuramentum recusetur non est necessarium, vt cos & singulae partes eius sint male: satis est, vt velvna sit mala. That the Oath may be refused, it is not necessary that al & euery part therof be naught, it is inough that one only be naught. Is not this plaine inough?
               Next after this he taketh in hand the defence of that translation of the Cardinalls subscription vnto his Letter Your very reuerend brother Robert Cardinall Bellarmine: the latin being as you haue now seene, Admodum Rdae 
                  Domis 
                  Vae 
                  frater & seruus in Christo Robertus Card. Bellarminus. And it is a world to see how many wayes he windeth himself to get out of this brake. First he beginneth with a tal
                     •
                   of a certayne Emperour,A foolish fiction of M. Barlow without application. that would perforce make a gentleman belieue that he was like to be sicke, for that he saw a pimple rising vnder his naile: but this tale he applyeth not: and I se not where vnto indeed he may apply it. Then cōming to the matter, he demaundeth this question: Suppose it were not exactly translated, is not the sense all one? Whereto I answere, no: for it were somewhat ridiculous to call him selfe M Blackwels Reuerend Brother. For by the same reason he writing to a Duke; & 
                     •
                  aying, Excellentiae Vestrae Frater, might translate it, your excellent Brother: and the same might a poore man doe in like manner writing to the same Duke,M. Barlows trifl
                        •
                     ng ignorance. 
                  Excellentia vestrae humillimus seruus: your most humble Excellent Seruant: which I thinke no man will approue. But M. Barlow will proue it by reason, for that both the Brotherhood sa
                     •
                  th he, and Reuerence are reciprocall, and may be referred to both parties either, your Reuerence-ships brother, or your Reuerend brother: but this is refuted now already by my examples al
                     •
                  edged. And besides this wil M. Barlow haue no respect to the cases and genders in Latin? Is not Reuerenda
                  
with a dipthong, and of the femynine gender, and genitiue case, different from Reuerendus of the masculine gender and nominatiue case? And if they be different, how can they then be reciprocal in signification & translation?
               But yet further M. Barlow hath another shift, saying: that in the written copy D. in the end had such a dash, as it might be taken for dus or dae. But this shift is worse then any of the rest, for so much as that D. doth not stand in the end of the subscription, but in the very beginning, as hath byn seene by the words before set downe, which are Ad
                     
                        •••

                  Vrae, which D. though it had neuer so great a dash, yet could it not signify dus, by force of the sense, being set in the first place, and in such order as it was.
               After this M. Barlow attempteth another euasion demanding of me,
                     Barl. pag. 203. why I had not translated the word Domi

Barlow answereth argumēts by telling of tales, & those little to the purpose. and therupon telleth vs againe another tale out of Diogenes L

                   (for he is copious in this kind out of his note books as before I haue aduertised:) and the tale is, that Diogenes the Cynicke begging a tallent at King Alexanders hands, he

                  d it was to much for a Cynicke to aske, then he damā
                  ded him a halfe-penny, but the other answered, it was to little for Alexander to giue, and with this M. Barlow thinketh he hath wel satisfied the controuersy in hand.
               Next vnto this there is an exception made against Cardinal Bellarmine his Letter to M. Blackwel,
                  Card. Bellarmine wrongfully charged by M. Barlow for mistaking the question. as though therin he had mistaken the whole state of the question by going about to impugne the old Oath of Supremacy made in King Henry the eight his time, insteed of this new Oath intituled of Allegiance, and consequently, that the Cardinal did batter a castle in the ayre of his owne framing. Which as I confessed, had beene a great ouerfight in him, so learned and famous a man, if it could be proued: so I did conuince by sundry euident arguments, and by Cardinal Bellarmines owne words, that it was not so: but that he impugned directly

this later Oath of Allegiance: The cause why this was obiected to Cardinal Bellarmine was, for that he going about to impugne the vnlawfulnes of this later Oath, doth insist much in reprouing the Kings spiritual Supremacy, and in shewing the same to belong to the Bishop of R

                     mus Iuramentum hoc Catholicis propositum, non solum ciuilem obedientiam, sed etiam Catholicae fidei abnegationem requirere. We shal first proue that this (later) oath proposed vnto Catholicks, doth not only require ciuil Obedience, but abnegatiō also of Catholick faith. And he proueth it by fiue or six arguments.
               First by the words of the English Statute, the title wherof is, for the detecting and repressing of Papists: which word of Papists, importing such as stick to the Pope, or defend his Supremacy, maketh it euident that the Statute was not intended only against them that deny ciuill Obedience, but rather the Kings Supremacy in spiritual affaires. Secondly by the words of the Oath themselues, that the Pope cannot by himselfe, or any other, or by any authority of the Church depose &c. Which is some denyal of the Pope his authority, and consequently not meerely only of temporal Obedience: and so out of foure or fiue points more by him obserued, and there set downe; which as I had not seene, when I wrote my Epistle, before the publicatiō of the said Cardinals booke: so I vsed not those arguments, nor any of them, but contented my selfe with one only taken out of the Cardinals words in the beginning of his Letter to M. Blackwel, as sufficiently prouing the same that in it sel
                     •
                  e was most cleare, I said as followeth.
               
                  This exception against the Cardinal for mistaking the state of the cause,
                        Lett. p. 71. seemeth to be most clerely refuted by the very first lynes almost of the letter it selfe. For that telling M. Blackwel, how sory he was vpon the report, that

he had taken illicitum Iuramentum, an vnlawfull Oath, he expoundeth presently, what Oath he meaneth, saying: Not ther

                        ewhat tempered and modified &c. Which is euidently meant of the new Oath of Allegiance, not only tempered with diuers lawfull clauses of Ciuill Obedience, as hath bene shewed, but interlaced also with other members that 
                        •
                     each to Religion: wheras the old Oath of Supremacy hath no such mixture, but is plainly, and simply set downe, for absolute excluding the Popes Supremacy in caus
                        •
                     s Ecclesiasticall, & for making the King supreme Head of the Church in the same causes: all which is most euident by the Statutes made about the same, from the 25. yeare of King Henry the 8. vnto the end of the raigne of King Edward the sixt.
               
               To this declaration of myne M. Barlow is in effect as mute as a Macedonian frogge, if to say nothing at al to the purpose be to be mute, though words and wynd be not wanting. But first to the Cardinalls six argumentes he s
                     •
                  yth neuer a word, albeit he had both seene and read them, as may be be presumed. To my reason of the difference between the Oath of Supremacy and this of Allegiance, for that this is modified and tempered with different clauses of thinges partly touching ciuil Obediēce and partly Religion, wheras the other is simply of Religion, against the Popes Supremacy: to this, I say, he answereth with this interrogation: If this Oath be so modified i
                        •
                      comparison of the other, why is it accounted by 
                        •
                     he Censurer the greatest affliction and pressure, that euer befel the Catholickes? Do you see what a question he maketh, and how farre from the purpose? My intention was, and is to proue, that for so much as Cardinall Bellarmine did particulerly impugne this mixt and tempered Oath, therfore he did not mistake the question by impugning only the other Oath of Supremacy, as was obiected; there being between them this difference amongst others, that the one, to wit of Allegiāce, is compounded of different clauses (as hath bene said) partly touching ciuill Obedience, and partly Religion:

wheras this other of Supremacy is simply of Religion. This was my demonstration. And to what purpose then (for answere of this) was brought in that other dem

                  und of M. Barlow,
                  All is one with M. Barlow for a thing to be moderated or to be modified.
                   asking vs very seriously why this second Oath should be afflictiue vnto vs, if it be modifyed and tempered? Is there any sense in this? We say, for so much as it is compounded and tempered, as the other is not, therfore it was meant by the Cardinal, and not the other: M. Barlow saith, if it be so tempered, why doth it afflict yow? We say first, that this is nothing to the purpose, noe more then, VVhich is the way to London? A poke

               Secondly to M. Barlowes impertinent demand we say, that albeit we grant that this second Oath is modifyed and tempered: yet we say not that it is moderate and temperate, for a law that in substance is mild, may be by some clauses or circumstances so modified, that is to say, framed in such manner, as it may be seuere and rigorous: and a thing may be tempered aswell with exasperating ingredientes as mollifying, and as well with afflictiue as leniti

                  e compounds: and so is this Oath more sharpe perhaps then the other; and so doth M. Barlow him selfe confesse within a few lynes after, saying:

And yet as though we did not see nor feele this, he will needs haue vs to acknowledge in the same place that this Oath is allaied, tempered, corrected, and moderated (for all these are his wordes) by the variety of clauses therein contayned, & theron foundeth his subsequent discourse of our ingratitude in not accepting the same; wheras both he, and we do hold the contrary, that it is more stinging, as now you haue heard, and that euen by his owne confession: what then shall we say of this manner of M.

                   I do not see why she might not be called aswell supreme Head of the Church, as supreme Gouernour. And if it could not, then is there some difference in the names, for that according to the Protestant Bishops, & diuers of King Edwards dayes, that made the forenamed Statute, all spirituall power descended from the title of Headship, which is here denied to descend from the Title of supreme Gouernour. And this shalbe sufficient for this place.
               
                  WHETHER THE DENYING Of taking this New Oath doe include the deniall of all the particuler clauses contayned therin? §. II.
                  IN the progresse of the Argument here handled about the refusall of this New Oath, the Apologer affirmeth first, as you haue heard that there was no one clause in the whole Oath that touched Religion, but were all and meerly of Ciuill Obedience. Secondly, that a man could not refuse this Oath, but he must refuse all & euery one of the clauses therin contained. The former point hath bene

And yet this is that which our Apologer vseth heere with Catholicks, affirming in good earnest, that he which refuseth the whole body of this Oath, as it is conceyued (in respect of some clauses therof that stand against his Conscience, about matters of Religion) refuseth consequently euery poynt and parcell therof, and must of necessity hold (in the first place) that our Soueraigne Lord King Iames is not the lawfull King of this Kingdome, and of all other his Maiesties Dominions. The contrary wherof all Catholicks do both confesse, and professe: & consequently it is a meere calumniation that they deny this.

Secondly it was not necessary to tell the clause in particuler that contayned the Arianisme, for that some of the people perhaps, that demaunded him the question could not well vnderstand it, and therefore it was sufficient to say, that the oath was, as it lay, naught: that there was some heresie therin: as if a Phisitian should say of a dish of myn

                      For according to the common sentence of Philosophers, that which is good, must consist of the whole cause, that is to say, of all parts requisite; but to make a thing euill it is sufficient, that it hath but some one defect; wherefore, for prohibiting or refusing this Oath as euill, it is not necessary, that all and euery part thereof be euill, but it is inough if any one part therof be naught. And soe on the contrary part, to the end that this oath may be admitted, as good and lawfull, it is necessary that no part thereof be euill.

And secondly we see, that he doth not condemne al the parts of this oath, for that some be vnlawfull, but rather proueth the contrary out of the common sentence of Philosophers, that if any one part be euil, it is sufficiēt to make the Oath euil & vnlawful.
In which kind M. Barlow himselfe in the very nex

                        ect is sufficient to make the thing euil;More required to a good action then to an euil. but to make it good, al that is requisite must be obserued.
And so in this Oath, to make it vnlawful, it is inough that any one clause therof be naught, or against a Catholick mans conscience, but to make it good and lawfull, al the clauses therof must be good and lawfull. And so you see how substantially M. Barlow hath answered this point, ouer throwing himselfe with his owne argument.
                  I wil not stand to confute that other mad assertion of his, more franticke then fantastical, wherby he affirmeth, and wil needes defend, that whosoeuer refuseth to sweare, to any one of the articles of this Oath, acknowledgeth not the first, that King Iames is lawful King of England. And what is his reason trow you? No other, but that of the Indenture before mentioned: for the whole Oath, sayth he, is like an Indenture,

                        eits the whole; the denying of one article in the Oath, is the dental of the whole, euen of the very first, that King Iames is not lawful King. So he. But he that shall examine the matter wel, wil find that this pretended parity betweene the Oath and Indenture, articles and Prouiso's,
                     The difference betweene this Oath and an Indenture.
                      is only in sound of words, and not in substance; for that in making an Indenture, and the Prouiso's therof, both parts must agree, that the breach of euery such Prouiso shal forfeit the whole; for that otherwise euery such Prouiso, doth not euacuate the whole Indenture,

or make it naught. But herein framing this new Oath, and the articles therof, there is not the consent or agreement of al those that are required to take the Oath, nor obligatiō of conscience to agree: but rather to the contrary, they are bound by the principles of their religion to disagree, and disclaime against the same, as preiudicial to their soules. So as here those articles, or different clauses. are not as Prouiso's agreed vpon, as in an Indenture, but rather as points, and conditions proposed and required by the Landlord, wherof the Tenant may by right deliberate and consider, whether they stand wel for him or noe. And if not, he may refuse them, or at the least so many as he shal thinke to be hurtful or iniurious vnto him. Neither is the denyal of any one or more, the denial of al, as M. Barlows bad Diuinity, and worse Philosophy presumeth, to teach men that it is.
                  But yet before I end this matter, on which he standeth so much, I would demand him further, whether this his assertion be not general concerning al Kings, and he may not wel deny it, for that his reason is general as presently ensueth; saying,
                        Barl. pag. 215. 
                     The King being once in lawful possession, whosoeuer shal say, that he may be deposed for any cause, denieth that he is lawfull King. Wherupon it followeth, that the Kings of France, & Spaine also are no lawful, or true Kings in the opinion of their subiects, for that they al with vniforme consent, do hould this doctrine of the Church, that Kings and Princes may in some cases 
                        •
                     e excommunicated and deposed. Saul also was neuer lawful King, for that he was deposed, or els must we say that God did him iniury in deposing him.
                  It followeth also by this inference of M. Barlow, that if a man should deny to sweare to the last clause only, of al the Oath, to wit, that he sweareth al the former articles hartily, willingly, and truly, vpon the faith of a Christian: So help him God. &c. doth deny to acknowledg King Iames to be lawfull King; which is another point of parasitisme, more ancient (perhaps) then the former, especially if you adde therunto his propositions, vsed here to that effect, as namely,

that if he were once lawful, he

               To all this, what sayth M. Barlow? He beginneth with a tale, as he is wont, when he hath little els to say: Pericles (sayth he) as some do affirme, had that skill in wrastling, that though he receaued a fall, yet he would perswade the wrastler, that cast him, and the spectatours that beheld him, that he was the conquerour.

First he saith, that this Conncell was gathered by the cōmand of King Sisenandus. And what maketh this to the purpose? Did not we graunt also, that Kings within their Kingdomes,

may cause Prouinciall Councels to be made by their Bishops, Archbishops, & Metropolitans? But how submissiuely this King did behaue himselfe in that Coūcell, appeareth by his former submission, both in fact & words. And ye

In which Treatise of discipline, was contayned in like manner the Kings owne temporall cause, concerning the assuring of his succession by Ecclesiasticall Cēsures. When or wherin then shall we find M. Barlow to deale pūctually, and sincerely? But let vs go forward.
               In the next place, he sayth, that this Councell, & the Canons therof do make for the Protestants, and giueth example in three or foure Canons, and concludeth generally in these words: The Church o

                  M. Barlowes shameles assertion. Well then we shall see presently, how many they be. He citeth only foure of seauenty and foure, and those so impertinently, as by the citation he maketh himselfe miserable, as now you will perceaue.
               And first he cyteth the 43. Canō, saying, that the marriage of Priests, so it be with the consent of the Bishop, is therin allowed: and he beginneth with this, for that it seemeth to him a knocker, and to the purpose indeed, for authorizing Priests marriages. Wherfore we shall handle it

in the last place of the foure alleadged by him.
               In the second place then he leapeth back from the 43. Canon, to the 24. saying, that therin it was positiuely set downe, that ignorance is the mother of all errours, but not of de

A great obiection no doubt against vs; as though we were great friends of ignorance: Ignorance (sayth the Canon) the mother of all errours, is most to be auoyded by Priests, who haue the office of teaching the people.

Why then is this Canon brought in against vs? For that perhaps it sayth not, that Ignorance is the mother of deuotion, nor we neither, as it hath bene sufficiently proued against Syr Francis H

Barlow very ignorant, but not very deuout. was neuer affirmed by any position of Catholikes, and was proued to be very false in Syr Francis owne person, who shewed himselfe to be very ignorant, and yet nothing deuout. And the same in due measure and proportion, may be verified in M. Barlow: & if he deny it, let vs part our proofes. I haue shewed his ignorance in alleaging this Canon that maketh nothing for him; let him proue his deuotion.
               From the 24. Canon he steppeth forward againe, to the 46. Wherin he saith, is decreed that the Clergies imm

True it is that he, as a good Catholike Prince, was very forward therin, yet the Decree was the Councels, and therfore it is sayd in the Canon, id decreuit Sanctum Concilium, the holy Councell decreed it. Neither do we teach that this immunity, or freedome of the Clergy, from secular burthens, is without the consent, & concurrence of Christian Princes, proceeding out of their piety, and deuotion towards the Church, to fauour & further that, which was esteemed by the Church needfull to Gods seruice, & conforme to Gods diuine Law, both written, & impressed by nature.

                   I send M. Barlow to Schoole, though much against his will: where also he will learne, that long before this fact of King Sisenandus, other Christian Emperours and Kings, had consented to these immunities of Clergy men, and confirmed the same by their temporall lawes & decrees: which piety King Sisenandus did follow, and imitate in Spaine. And would God he would inspire his Maiesty to do the same in England.
               But what helpeth this M. Barlowes cause? Truly euen as much as the rest. Let vs see if you please, what is his fourth Canon, which he cyteth for his proof, of the Coū
                  cels agreement with Protestants.M Barlow for a Canon leapeth out of the booke. He leapeth then lastly to the 75. Canon, which is one more then is in the booke, for there be but 74. but this is a small fault in respect of that which presently ensueth. His words are these: Lastly that all the decrees, and Canons of that Councell, were confirmed by the Clergy, annuente religiosissimo Principe, after the Kings royll assent had vnto them, and that set downe Can. 75.
                     Can. 75. But first of all if the thing did stand in the Councell as heere it is set downe, that the Princes consent and confirmation had bene demaunded to all the Decrees, and Canons, as

For they hauing ended all, and made a large prayer for the prosperity of the said King, and all said Amen, it is added lastly: Definitis itaque

                  fore hauing defined these things, that before are comprehended, it seemed good also by the consent of our most Religious Prince, that forsomuch as these things, that are decreed are profitable for the Church, and for our soules, we do strengthen them also by our owne subscriptions, to the end they may remayne. I Isidorus in the name of Christ Metropolitan Bishop of the Church of Siuill, hauing decreed these things, do subscribe &c. And so did all the other Bishops by name.
               Heere then I see not what M. Barlow can gayne by alleaging this Canon. For if this allowance of King Sisena

                  There remaineth then to examine a little the first allegation out of the 43. Canon, where he sayth, that Priests marriage is allowed in this Canon, so it be with the cōs

                   Wherin two egregious frauds are discouered so manifestly as he could not but know when he wrote them, that they were such. The first is, for that he translateth Presbyteri, for Clerici, peruersly thereby turning Clarks into Priests, knowing well inough what he did, for that he must needs see the difference in the very Canon, as presently we shall shew. The second fraud is, that he knowing, that this Coūcell did vtterly disallow the marriage of Priests, yet he shamed not to affirme the quite contrary. We shall say a word of the one and the other.
               For the first he alleageth as you haue heard, the 43. Canō, whose words are: Clerici qui sine consultu Episcopi sui du

                     •
                  nder Subdeacon, which is the first of the three that excludeth marriage. This is seene by many Canons, as namely by the 40. which beginneth thus: Omnes Clerici vel Lectores, siue Leuitae & Sacerdotes, detonso superiùs capite toto, inserius solam circuli coronam relinquant. All Clarks and Readers, as also Deacons and Priests, cutting of all the hayre of the vpper part of their head, let them leaue in the lower part only the crowne of a circle. Here you see that Clerici, & Sacerdotes are distinct Degrees:M. Barlowes forgery discouered about the Marriage of Priests. you see also this Ceremony of discipline in that Church of Spaine. Will M. Barlow confesse that his Church agreeth in this? The tytle also of the 67. Canon is, de cupiditate Episcopi, Presbyteri, v

                      Clericorum: Of the couetousnes of a Bishop, of a Priest, or Deacon, or Clarks. Wherby is euident that in the Councels sense, Priests, Deacons and Clarkes are distinct Orders in the Church, and consequently though the Councell doth say that Clarks may not take wiues, without the consent of their Bishops; yet their meaning is not that

may take wiues, with the said consent; so as in this M. Barlow was false, and knew that he deceaued, when he translated Clerici for Priests.
               But now for the second point, that he must needes know also, that the meaning of this Councell could not be, that Priests myght marry, by allowance of the Bishop, I proue it thus, for that this Councell did make profession to follow their Auncestors, and forefathers decrees; and we find registred in an ancient Spanish Councell held three hundred yeares before this, called Elibertinum, this Canon which is the 33. of the said Councell; Placuit in totum prohibere Episcopis, Praebyteris, Diaconibus & Subdiaconibus positis in Minist

                         about the chastity of Subdeacons, Deacons & Priests.
                   After this agayne in another Coūcell of Toledo, which was the second held some hundred yeares before this fourth, the mater is determined in the very first Canon thus, speaking of yong men, that pretended to take holy Orders, & to be Priests: Vbi octauum decimum aetatis suae compleuerint annum &c. When they shalbe full eighteen yeares of age, let the Bishop in the presence of the Clergie and people search their wils, about desire of marriage, & then if by the inspiration of God, the grace of chastity shall please them, and they shall answer that they will keep their promise made of chastity, without coniugall necessity, then let these men, as desirous of a most strait way, be admitted vnder the most sweet, and easie yoake of our Sauiour.
And first, let them take the Ministry of Subdeacon at 20. 
                        •
                     eares of age after the probation had of their constancy, and at 25. yeares, let them take the office of Deacon: cauendum tamenest his, ne quando suae sponsionis immemores, ad terrenas nuptias vltrà recurrant: yet must these men take heed, least being at any time forgetfull of their promise or band, they

do run backe to earthly marryage.
               
               By these two more ancient Councells then of Spayne (not to speake of others) we may see what could be the sense of this fourth of Toledo, cōcerning marriage of Priests, as also what is meant by that direction giuen in the 26. Canon: vt quando Presbyteri, aut Diaconi per parochias constituun

                     ant: when Priests or Deacons are appoynted throughout Parishes, they must first make profession vnto their Bishop, that they will lyue chastly and purely. The Councell doth not say heere, that they may take wiues, with the Bishops consent, as was said of Clerici before. Wherfore in both these points, I meane as well in this translation, as in the maine assertion, that then it was lawfull for Priests to haue wiues, M. Barlow dealt fraudulently. I will not cite other Councells held both before and after this both in Spaine & elswhere concerning this matter: as before, that of Toledo the third about the yeare 589. that of Lyons, 5

               Yet can I not pretermyt one Canon of the forsaid third Councel of Toledo held vpon the point of fifty yeares before this fourth,Let S

                  It is vnderstood by this holy Councell, that certayne Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, comming from Heresie, do contynue to haue carnall desires, and copulation with their wiues, and to the end this may not be done hereafter, it is cōmanded by the Councell, as also it hath bene determyned in former Canons, that it is not lawfull for them to lyue togeather in carnall society, but that so long as coniugall faith doth

                      perill; yet let them place their wiues in another house,

that their chastitie may haue testimony, both before God and man.
And if any man after this ordinatiō, will choose rather to liue scandalously with his wife, let him be deposed from Priestly function, and beheld only as a Lector or a Reader &c.Priests liuing with their wiues noted by the Councell to come from heretikes. By which ordination of the Coūcell, we may see the seueritie of that time, not only in keeping Priests from marriage after they were Priests, but euen in forbiding the vse of their wiues that were married before, if any such were admitted. And it is to be noted, that the Coūcell saith here, that this custome of Priests liuing with wiues, came from the heroticks of those dayes, and was practized by them principally, that were turned from heresy to Catholike Religion.
               And finally I cannot pretermit, for the vpshot of this matter, to note one sentence of Isidorus Archbishop of Si

                     asti sint, & continentes ab vxoribus. It seemed good vnto the holy Father, to determine that such as do handle the holy mysteries, should be chast, & continent from wiues. And thus much for the first point auerred by M. Barlow, that foure Canons of the fourth Councel of Toledo do make for him, and his religion. But now we haue seene his ill fortune in the choice, for that no Canon maketh for him, but rather all against him, and especially this last.
               Now let vs see somewhat about the second point, that the Church of England at this day, both for substance in doctrine, and Cerimony in discipline doth hould the same, which many of the said Canons do conclude: which though as before, I haue noted, it may seeme to be a very dubious & imperfect assertion, for that they of England, being Christians, and so those of that Councel also, it were very

                  For this the consent of the vniuersall Church hath establyshed in all parts of the Christian world, and consequently it is conuenient to be obserued throughout the Prouinces of Spayne, and Galicia, and therfore if any Bishop, Priest, or Deacon, or any whatsoeuer of the order of Clarks, shall be found to esteeme, or perferre his own iudgment before this Constitution of ours, let him be put from the office of his order, and depriued of the Cō

Might not Beares as soone be brought to the stake, as these men againe to their Monasteries to do penance? And yet if they had bene in Spayne at that time, this Spanish discipline would haue brought them backe, which M. Barlow in generall saith, that his Church houldeth also: but when i

                   commeth to the particuler, I doubt not but he will go from his word againe: and therfore I will stand no longer vpon this point, though many other examples might be alleaged.
               There remayneth only then now for the conclusion of this Chapter, to see and weigh the comparisons that may be made betweene this Oath of fidelity of the Spanish subiects vnto their King Sisenandus (the keeping wherof is so earnestly recommended by this Councell) and this other English Oath of Allegiance, required by his Maie

                  ie,

wherin I sayd I found no more parity or semblance, but as that was an Oath of ciuill Obedience to their temporall Prince, so is this also in some clauses, and therfore as the Councel did well allow, yea much recommend and incharge the keeping of that Oath to King Sisenand
                        ••
                     
                  : so do all good Catholickes desire the obseruation of the foresaid clauses contayned in this Oath, so far forth, as they concerne the said temporall obedience. But this doth not proue that any such forme of Oath as this new Oath is, was there prescribed or decreed, either quoad for
                     
                        •••
                     , or quoad materiam. For as for the forme, I find no particuler forme set downe or decreed in the Councell, as hath bene said, but only an admonition to keepe the Oath before taken, with an earnest dehortation, & commination against all perfidious conspiring or rebelling against their King, which we most willingly also agree vnto. And as for the matter and subiect of the Oath it is cleere,The difference betwene the Oath of the Councel of Toledo & the English oath of pretended Allegiāce. that, that was of temporall obedience only, and had no such clauses against the authority of the Bishop of Rome, as this hath: nor can it be imagined with any probability that if any such thing had bene proposed by K.

                     •
                  ake it, or allowed it to others, to be either proposed or taken.
               Well then, what saith M. Barlow to this conclusion? Certes he seeketh so say many things, but so far from the purpose, that he truly may be sayd to say nothing. He setteth downe clauses of my speach, with his answers thus. First, quoth I, there is noe partyculer forme of an oath put downe in the Councell and consequently this new forme could not be taken from that. He answereth; Can an oath be kept which was not first taken? But what is this to the purpose: for the question is not, whether the Spaniards did take an Oath to their King or not, for that is graunted, but whether the forme of the oath were like to this of ours. And yet as though he had answered to the purpose he goeth forward to proue that an Oath was taken. It appears
                  
(sayth he) in the Canon i

                        〈◊〉
                      Councell what is that to the point?
                  Very wisly spoken. Truly Syr nothing at all: as is neither this your prouing of that which is not denied, but it had bene much to the point to proue that, that forme and this forme had bene a like, and soe the one confirmed by the other, which you attempt not at all to do. And yet I pray thee good Reader, see heere how he braggeth immediatly. Sufficiently (sayth he) hath the Apolog
                        ••
                      euicted what he would to proue that the oath of Allegiance amongst 
                        〈◊〉
                      is no such strange thing, hauing a president in like kind confirmed by diuers Councells, about a thousand yeares sithence.
               
               But I would demaund of M. Barlow, what was the question betweene vs? Was it whether there were euer any oath of Allegiance to temporall Princes allowed, or taken in the Christian world before this of ours? For if this were the question, then hath he sufficiently euicted his purpose, by shewing that so long ago an oath of Allegiāce was allowed in the Councell of Toledo. But if this was not the question, but only whether there was a like Oath to this in forme or matter allowed in the Councell of Toledo, then hath M. Barlow euicted nothing, but his own disgrace, for that he hath run quite from the purpose.
               And yet to seeme to say somewhat, he returneth agayne afterward to speake of the forme, and matter of this oath, recommended in the Councell of Toledo.
                  And first he sheweth, that albeit the forme be not expressed in the Councel, yet must it be persumed to haue bene made in the name of God, as is commaunded in Deuteronomy the 6. But this is very general.
Then he setteth downe a certayne Protestation made by the Bishops, and Archbishops in the sixt Councell of Toledo, for the temporall safety of their Prince, in these words: Ideo testamur 
                        〈◊〉
                      Deo, & omni ordine Angelorum &c.

                      before the quire of holy Prophets, and Apostles, and of all

Martyrs, and before the whole Catholike Church, and congregation of Christians, that no man intend the destruction of the King, that no man attempt any thing against the life of the Prince, that no man depriue him of the gouernment of the Kingdome, that no man by Tyrā
                     nicall presumption vsurpe vnto himself the height of his Kingdome, that no man by any machination in his aduersytie do associate vnto him the assistance of Conspirators;

                      and if any man shall presume to attempt any of these thinges, let him be stroken with our Curse, and be condemned to euerlasting iudgment without any hope of remedy.
               
               Here now M. Barlow tryumpheth,A fond triumph of M. Barlow before the victory. and sayth, that this is a forme of an oath prescribed, and therfore I haue lost my credit, that denied the same (in the 4. Councel.) Whereto first I answere, that this is rather a protestation of the Councel, a commination, or threatning to others as appeareth by the punishment appointed, thē any forme of an oath, either taken by themselues or prescrybed to others. And secondly I say, that this is so far different from the forme of our new oath of Allegiance, now exacted as nothing can be more; which euery man will see by comparing them togeather: for I hope M. Barlow will not allow the inuocation of Angells, Prophetts, Apostles & Martyrs called for witnesses, as heere is vsed: and so the formes are nothing like, nor is this an Oath made to the King. But let vs see somewhat more of this matter.
               He alleageth my exception, that the Oath in the Councell confirmed, was an Oath of ciuill Allegiance only, which neither the Catholikes refuse, now Pope Paulus doth prohibite. Against which he maketh a long idle discourse, that the same thinges are contayned in the one, and the other Oath, as the safety of the King, the preseruation of his life and Crowne, and the like. Which though in some part it be acknowledged to be true (and in this we haue no difficulty to agree with him:) yet is not this only sought in the new Oath, but the deniall also of the Popes authority. Or if M. Barlow will contend, that this of the Princes safety, is

only sought:The Coū
                     cel of Toledo would neuer haue allowed of the new Oath. we answere, that at least it is not sought by good and lawfull meanes, but by such as the Councel of Toledo would neuer haue yielded vnto, if their King Sis

               There remayneth then only the last clause to be examined, whether the said Councell of Toledo did prouide euen for the particuler point of Equiuocation, as the Apol

To which effect I haue alleaged many proofes out of the nature and definition, both of the one, and the other, many examples out of the holy Scriptures, out of the old & new Testament, the authority of sundry ancient Fathers, the practice of many Saints, the consent of Schoolmen, and other like proofes, which M. Barlow hauing read and wel pondered, should haue confuted, or at least some of thē in this place, before he had cast him selfe anew into M.

For thus he describeth Equiuocation & lying.A grosse lye of M. Barlow.
                   
                  VVhen a man, saith he, speaketh any thing contrary to that he thinketh in his mind, Equiuocare est (say the Iesuits) mentiri est, sayth the M. of Sentences. Wheras notwithstanding, euery learned man knoweth that both the Iesuits, and others that write of this matter do agree with the M. of Sētences in this point. For whosoeuer speaketh cōtrary to that which in his mind he thinketh, it is a lye, & no Equiuocatiō, for he that doth Equiuocate, must alwayes haue a true sense in his owne meaning, which he cannot haue, who doth speake contrary to that which in his mind he thinketh.
               Then goeth he forward in his declaration, saying:
                     Barl. pag. 226. 
                  The principall difference which they make is in their purpose, for that they do it not with an intent to deceaue, but only to defend themselues: and then as though this supposed ground were true, he goeth forward to shew vpon the same, that a good intention is not sufficient, to iustifie the doing of that which is

euill: but this principall difference seemeth to be a principall ignorance in M. Barlow,
                  M. Barlowes principall ignorāce. shewing that he doth not vnderstand indeed wherin we do put the principall difference betweene lying and equiuocating, which is not in the purpose and intention of the speaker, as he sayth, but partly in the thing it selfe vttered, to wit, that it be really true, in the sense, and meaning of the vtterer: and then in the quality of the hearer, whether he be a lawfull iudge, and therby may oblige the speaker, to speake to his intention, and other such circumstances, which are largely hā
                  dled in my foresaid booke, and not vnderstood as it seemeth, or not read by M. Barlow, which me thinkes he ought to haue done, meaning to treate of this matter here. And so I shall passe no further therin, but referre him & the Reader, to the larger Treatise of that subiect already extant.
               
                  CARDINALL BELLARMINE is cleered from a false imputation: and a controuersie about certaine words & clauses in the Oath is discussed. § II.
                  AFTER this M. Barlow passeth to a poynt concerning Cardinall Bellarmine, set downe in the Apology in these words: Some of such Priests and Iesuites as were the greatest traytors & fomentours of the greatest conspiracies against her late Maiesty

So sayth the Apologer, & noteth in the margēt, Campian & Hart in their conference in the Tower. This was noted by me in my Letter, as an vniust charge, both in respect of the two men mētioned in the margent, who were most free from being traytours, and much more the greatest Traytours: excepting only their Priestly functiōs most iniuriously made Treasōs, against all truth & equity, as aboundantly else where hath bene proued; but much more in respect of Cardinall Bellarmine, who was not so

Barlow is also forced here to confesse,M. Barlowes childish imputations against Cardinall Bellarmine. and sayth that it was meant in matters of the Conference in the Tower: but euery man of iudgment will se what the words of the former charge do import, and how farre they reach, which M. Barlow considering, he dareth not stand to his first refuge, but addeth, that Bellarmine in his Booke which English Priests do study, doth teach such doctrine as is the ground of rebellions: he blowes (sayth he) the bellowes of seditious doctrine, which flames out by his Schollers conspiracy, to the disturbāce of the chiefest States of Christendome.
                     
                        Barl. pag. 230. But this now men will see how passionate, and vntrue it is, that the chiefest States of Christendome are disturbed by Cardinall Bellarmines doctrine: I do not meane to stand vpon the confutation of so childish imputations.
                  There followeth a certaine small controuersie, about the words temperate, and tempered, whether they signify the same or no: wherof we haue handled somewhat before, & so shall dispatch it here in a word. Cardinall Bellarmine had said in his Letter to M. Blackwell, that this Oath is not therfore lawfull because it is offered as tempered, and modified, with diuers clauses of ciuill Obedience, giuing an example out of S. Gregory Nazianzen of the Ensignes of the Emperour Iulian, wherin the Images of the Heathen Gods were mingled and conbyned togeather with the Emperors Picture, and therby so tempered & modified, as a man could not adore the one without the other. Which speach of the Cardinall was much reprehended by the Apologer, as though Bellarmine had misliked the temperate speach vttered in the forme of this oath. But that was no part of Bellarmines meaning, but that the said Oath was tempered, mixt, and compounded of different clauses, some lawfull, and some vnlawfull, as a man would say, morter is tempered with water, sand, & lyme: and this appeareth by his example of the Ensignes before mentioned tempered, that is, mixt with the images

of the Emperours, and their false Gods. And if M. Bar
                           •••
                        
                      will needs haue this temperament to haue also with it some temperature, which is his only reply now in this place, we will not greatly striue with him. Let it be esteemed to be some temperature, that here are mingled some clauses of ciuill obedience, with other concerning Religion, it helpeth the mixture, but not the scruple of conscience to him that must take it.
                  I pretermit all the rest of M. Barlows superfluous and idle speach about this matter, as striuing to say somewhat, but yet in substance sayth nothing. It followeth in my Letter, concerning the answering of two questions proposed by the Apologer, wherin I shall repeate againe my owne words then vttered: thus then I wrote. That the Apologer hauing said with great vehemency of asseueratiō,
                        Lett pag. 43 num. 24.
                     That heauen and earth are no further a sunder, then the profession of a Temporall Obedience, to a Temporall King, is different from any thing belonging to the Catholike fayth, or Supremacy of S. Peter (which we graunt also, if it be meere Temporall Obedience without mixture of other clauses:) he proposeth presently two questions for application of this to his purpose.Two questiōs proposed & solued. First this: As for the Catholike Religion (sayth he) can there be one word found in all this Oath, tending to matter of Religion? The second thus: Doth he that taketh it, promise to belieue, or not to belieue any article of Religion? Wherunto I answere first to the first, and then to the  second. To the first, that if it be graunted, that power & authority of the Pope, and Sea Apostolike left by Christ, for gouerning his Church in all occasions and necessities, be any poynt belonging to Religion among Catholikes, then is there not only some owne word, but many sentences, yea ten or twelue articles, or branches therin, tending and sounding that way, as before hath bene shewed.
                  
                  
                      To the secōd question, may make answer euery clause in effect of the Oath it selfe.Clauses of beliefe or not belief in the Oath. As for example the very first: I A. B. do truly, & sincerely acknowledge, professe, testify, & declare in my conscience, that the Pope neither of himselfe, nor by any authority of the Sea or Church of Rome, hath any power & authority &c. doth

not this include eyther beliefe or vnbeliefe? Againe:

                        I do further sweare, that I do from my hart abhorre, detest, & abiure, as impious & hereticall, that damnable doctrine, & position, That Princes which be excommunicated, and depriued by the Pope, may be deposed &c. Doth not here the swearer promise, not to belieue that doctrine which he so much detesteth? How then doth the Apologer so grossely forget, and contradict himselfe, euen then, when he goeth about to proue contradictions in his Aduersary?
                  
                  
                     It followeth consequently in the Oath:
                           Pag. 12. 
                        And I do belieue, and in conscience am resolued, that neyther the Pope, nor any person whatsoeuer, hath power to absolue me from this Oath, or any part therof. These words are plaine as you see. And what will the Apologer say heere? Is nothing promised in those words to be belieued, or not belieued?
                  
                  This was my speach. And now see what quarrell M. Barlow seeketh agaynst it. First wheras in my answer to the first question, I say, if it be granted, that the power and authority of the Pope, and Sea Apostolicke &c. be any point belonging to religion among Catholicks, then is there not only some one word, but many sentences concerning Religion in the Oath. What answereth M. Barlow? This Epistler (saith he) doth impudently impugne the Oath as vtterly vnlawfull, and agaynst religion, which yet dependeth vpon an If,
                        Barl. pag.

                        33. 
                     and is not yet determined for a point of religion, that the Pope hath any such authority ouer Kings, as in the Oath is mentioned. No Syr? not among Catholiks? (for of them only I speake, though you leaue it out, and doe many wayes corrupt my words:) Will not they grant the Popes authority in such cases to be a point belonging to their Religion?M. Barlowes caueling. Doth the word If put the matter in doubt, that when you say, If there be a God, this or that is true or false, you may be said to doubt, whether there be a God or no? And when you say, If I be a true man, this is so, you may be thought to doubt, whether your selfe be a true man or no? Do not you see that this is playne cauelling indeed, and not disputing? But what more? You say that when I do affirme the Popes power, I do not distinguish whether

in Ecclesiasticall or ciuill causes: but you know well inough that I haue often distinguished, and so do other Catholicke Deuines, that the Popes authority is directly only Ecclesiasticall and spirituall, for gouerning and directing of soules to euerlasting life; though indirectly for conseruation of this Ecclesiasticall, and Spirituall end, there is annexed also Temporall, in such cases, as before hath bene specified, concerning temporall Princes. And so this is but a shift to say, that I doe not distinguish.
                  As that is also another, about my answere to the second demaund of the Apologer, where he demandeth whether any man that taketh the Oath, doth promise to belieue, or not to belieue any one article of religion, contayned in the said Oath. For answere wherunto, I did set downe sundry clauses of the said Oath, wherby it seemeth plaine, that the swearer doth make such promise. Now you reply with this new shift, saying, that I doe still beg the question in controuersy. So you talke to seem to say somwhat. But what is the question in controuersy? Is it not whether the swearer doth make promise to belieue, or not to belieue any article of religion, in taking the Oath? Yes. And I haue proued that he doth so, by diuers examples. How then doe I beg the question, when I do euince it by proofe? You reply, that these articles abiured, or allowed by him that takes the Oath,
                     
                        Barl. pag. 234. concerning the Popes authority, are not points of

                        aith, but rather Machiauelismes of the Conclaue. But this now is rayling, and not reasoning, for that a Catholike conscience houldeth the doctrine of the Popes Supremacy,Machiauels principles agree better to Protestāts doctrine thē to the Catholike. and all poynts belonging therunto, for matters appertayning to fayth & Catholicisme, and not to Machiauelisme, which Machiauelisme agreeth much more fitly to M. Barlows assertions, that depend on the pleasures of Prince & State, alteration of times, and temporall vtilities (wherof Machiauel was a great Doctour,) then to the simple positions of Catholikes, who without these worldly respects, do playnly and sincerely imbrace and belieue, all such points of doctrine as the knowne Catholike Church doth deliuer vnto them, as any way appertayning to the integrity

of Catholike Religion.
                  Heere then M. Barlow being driuen from his refuge of my begging the question, layeth hand vpon another, much more ridiculous, in my opinion: for it is somewhat like the Sermon of the Parish Priest to his Parishioners, which he deuided into three parts;M. Barlow vnderstandeth not himselfe. the one, that he vnderstood, and not they; the other that they vnderstood, and not he; the third, that neither of them both vnderstood: and the third part seemeth to be our case now: for as I confesse, that I do not conceaue well, what M. Barlow would say, so I haue reason to suspect that himselfe also can hardly explane his owne meaning, or at least wise, he doth it not so here, as the Reader may easily vnderstand the same. His words are these: This censurer is an absurd dispu

It cannot be denied: for that the obiect being articles of Religion, as heere is sayd, which are not belieued but by diuine fayth, as they are such; it followeth, that in this question, the Apologer ma

And is not all this beliefe in Conscience, out of Conscience, and for Conscience, and of things belonging to Catholike Religion, to be vnderstood of Christian and Theologicall beliefe, but naturall only? Who would write so absurdly, but M. Barlow, who seemeth not to vnderstand what he writeth?
                  And that this may be better vnderstood, I am mynded to say a word or two more of this matter. He maketh a distinction heere as you see, betweene naturall, and Theologicall beliefe, adding for his reason, that the Obiects of naturall fayth, are naturall and ciuill things, and that such are the articles contained in the Oath,M. Barlowes grosse errour in Philosophy. ayming as before hath bene said, at the distinction of diuine and humane faith. But he is grosly deceaued, in that he distinguisheth these two faiths, or beliefes, by their materyall obiects, and things belieued, contrary to the generall consent of all Philosophers and Deuines, who do hould, that o
                           ••
                        es actus specificantur ab obiectis formalibus, that all acts are specified by their formall obiects, and not by their materyall, which may be the same in acts of different nature, and consequently cannot distinguish them: and so in our present purpose, these two faiths or beliefes are not distinguished, for that the one hath naturall and ciuill things for her obiects, and the other supernaturall. For that as well humane, and naturall faith, may both haue naturall, and supernaturall thinges for her obiects, as also dyuine and Theologicall faith may haue the same.
                  
                     Diuine & humane faith wherin they are distinguished.As for example, when a man belieueth that there is a Citty called Constantinople, for that many men do report it: and when a Pagan belieueth that there is a God, for that some learned Philosopher hath tould him so, to whom he giueth credit; heere both naturall, and supernaturall things are obiects of humane, and naturall fayth. And so on the contrary side, if a man should belieue naturall,

and ciuill things as reuealed by God in his Scriptures, or otherwise; as that Cayn killed his brother; Matth

Wherfore these two faithes and beliefes, are not distinguished by their materiall obiects, be they either naturall or supernaturall, but by their formal obiects or motiues; non per res creditas, sed per rationes credendi, as Scholemen say, not by the things that are beleiued, but by the motiues and causes, for which they are belieued: so as whatsoeuer is belieued vpon any humane motiue or authority, though in it self it be supernaturall, appertayneth to humane fayth, and not dyuine; so likwise on the contrary side, whatsoeuer is beleiued vpon diuine motiues and authoritie, and as reuealed from God, though in it self, it be naturall, and cyuill, as M. Barlow calleth it: yet doth it appertaine to Theologicall and diuine fayth, as an obiect thereof. But these things it is like M. Barlow hath no commodity to study, and therefore I would easily pardon him these rude and grosse escapes, if he did not shew himself so insolent in vaunting, as he doth, and so con

               IN the page 86. of my Letter, I do handle a certaine speach of Cardinal Bellarmine in his letter to the Archpriest, wherin he saith, that neither his maiestie of England, nor any Prince else hath cause to feare violence from the Pope, for that it was neuer heard o

                     il this day, that any Pope did command, that any Prince, though an hereticke, though an Ethnicke, though a persecutor, should be murthered,

or did allow of the murther, when it was done by another. Thus the Cardinall. Against which was obiected, that Popes had depriued diuers Princes, and had raysed great warres against others, and that in warre was contayned the casualty of killing in like manner. But this was answered, that the question was of murthering. Now what reply thinke you maketh M. Barlow? First he bringeth in a long idle discourse to shew that according to Homer, and other Poets, & politicke Historians, Princes ought to go alwayes armed, and vigilant for their safety; and then he maketh this demaund:The Pop

Thirdly he bringeth in my answer as saying, that though the Pope hath waged warre against Princes: yet he neuer caused any to be vnlaw

                        . pag. 217. saith he the Aduerbe is worth the obseruing, secretly implying, that the Pope hath commanded, or may command Princes to be murthered, but not vnlawfully. Wherin he sheweth himselfe to be a meere calumniator: for that I speaking diuers times of this matter, did neuer ioyne the Aduerbe vnlawfully with the word murthered; but in one place only I sayd thus: that albeit Popes vpon iust causes, haue waged warrs against diuers Princes, yet they neuer caused any to be vnlawfully made away, murthered, or allowed of their murthers committed by others. Where you see the Aduerbe vnlawfully is not ioyned with the word murthered, but with the wordes made away.
               
               And the like corruption of my wordes, and peruerting my sense, he vseth afterward in the same page, with intolerable iniquity, making me to say that which was farre from my meaning, concerning the warres betwene popes and Princes; and it is his generall fashion, neuer commonly to recite my wordes with sincerity.
                     Barl. pag. 239. But he goeth forward to proue, that Popes do command murthers of Princes, saying:

                   as M. Barlow falsifyeth him, but cum detrimento aliquo, & debilitatione ipsius corporis, though it be with some losse and weaknes of the said body. True it is, that in another case of Martyrdome, Bellarmine teacheth that the spirit may command the flesh to yield it selfe vp to the persecutour, for defence of Christian fayth: but this is not our questiō. So as in this first point M. Barlow is foūd to falsify: & in the second, to make a foolish consequēce, that for so much as Christian men may not tolerate in some cases an Infidell Prince &c. therfore they must murther him; as though there were no other remedy but murther: these are odious inferences, fit for such a spirit as M. Barlowes, who notwithstanding meaneth not to murther himselfe by the seuerity of Bellarmines doctrine, whom he falsely affirmeth to teach, that the spirit may subdue the flesh, by fasting and other chastisements, yea euen vnto death, nor yet to debilitate his body therby, according to Cardinall Bellarmines true doctrine.
               Another argument of the Popes murthers is made to be, for that he is said to haue cōmanded the body of Henry the 4. Emperour of that name, that died excōmunicated in Liege vpon the yeare 1106. to be taken out againe of his sepulcher, and thereof he inferreth, that if the Pope would vse such rage against a dead body, much more against alyue. But this argumēt houldeth no more, though the matter were true, as heere it is alledged, then the former, for that many things are done against Princes bodies

when they are dead, which would not be attempted in their life tyme. Who will not confesse this to be true?M. Barlows foolish consequence. But let vs leaue the consequent, & consider the antecedēt: two things are auouched by the Apologer pag. 65. first, that the Pope (which was then Paschal is the second) was enraged at the yong Emperour Henry the fi

The second was, that the Pope had stirred vp the said sonne Emperour against his Father. and for both these points were cited in the margent as wittnesses, Platina and Cuspinian in their Histories.
               To which I answered in my Letter,

                   that Platina had no such matter, & that Cuspinian had the contrary, to wit, that when Henry the Father was dead and buried in a monastery at Leige, his sonne would not make peace with the Bishop of that place, called Otbert, except the dead body were pulled out of the graue againe, as it was, and so remayned for fiue yeares. This I answered to the first point, about the exhumation of the body,

                     Henry the 4. not vnburied by Pope Pascalis. and besides that, take out of the sepulcher agayne the buried bodie of the said Emperour, which contrary to the Canons of the Church he had buryed the day before: his words are these: Leod

and excommunicated the same, were the cause why the body was taken vp agayne.

For digging vp, saith he, the dead body out of his graue, that is compassed with a whole cloud of witnesses. But if in all this cloud, we find nothing in manner, but clouted fraud

And as for Vrspergensis, he citeth his words thus: The Bishop of Leige with other of his sort were receiued into the communion of the Church (who cast them out but the Pope?) vpon condition they would dig out of the graue the corps of the Emperour, which he had before buried in the Monastery.

Whereunto he answereth heere by a certayne demaund, in a parenthesis, VVho cast them out (to wit those of Liege) but the Pope? Wherunto I answere that the Bishops and Archbishops that were with the new Emperour, had excommunicated them long before, and the Emperour himselfe had giuen out against them the Imperiall band, which is a ciuill excommunication: which besides that it is euident by the testifications of Histories, is made cleere also by that they receaued them into communion, presently vpon the death of the old Emperour, without imparting the matter to the Pope, which they would not haue done, if the excōmunication had not come from themselues: For that no man can take away, that which he could not impose. And so here is nothing proued against the Pope, but a great good will to calumniate him.

The vnexpected fame of the death of the old Emperour did presently ensue, which being diuulged, all those that for gayne-sake had stuck vnto him, and had sould their soules vnto him, did subiect themselues sine mora, without delay vnto the obedience of the yong Emperour, and to the Catholicke communion.
                  
But they of Liege were receaued into the said Cōmunion, with this condition, that the dead body of him that was excōmunicated, and buried the day before in a monastery, should be digged vp &c.
               In relating which words, we see that M. Barlow left out first the censure of the Author against them, that had followed the part of the old excōmunicated Emperour. And secondly he leaueth out, that they were reconcyled to the new Emperour, and to the Catholicke communion of the Bishops there present sine mora, without any stay, which inferreth that they could not send for the Popes consent to Rome. Thirdly, he leaueth out as he did in his former Author the words,M. Barlow trimmeth Authours to make thē against their wil's & cōtrary to that they write to speake for him.

To the new Emperour that would needs haue it so: which deliuereth the Pope from hauing any part therin. And doth not M. Barlow trim vp Authors well that passe through his hands to make them serue his purpose?
               But now you must heare the trymming of another, which is Cuspinian the Historiographer, whom I denied before, to affirme that Pope Paschalis was enraged with the new Emperour Henry the fifth, for burying his Father, as was said in the Apologie,
                     Lett. p. 87. but rather the contrary.
For that when King Henry the Father (said I) was dead, and buryed in a Monastery at Leige, Cuspinian writeth, that his Sonne would not make peace with the Bishop of that place, called Otbert, except the dead corpes were pulled out of the graue againe: which words he sayth, that I alleadged as Cuspinian his owne words.
But I deny it, but only I alledged his sense, as may appeare in that I did not recite them in a different letter, as is accustomed by them that deale playnly, when the proper words of any Author are alleaged, though M. Barlow doth not obserue this with

Let the Reader examine but some few places, as they come, cōferring his booke, and my booke togeather, and he shall see, that I haue good reason to make this complaint of his perfidious dealing therein. But now to the present case.
               M. Barlow affirmeth that the latyn words of Cusp

Out of which words I did inferre, that the Bishop of Leige could not be reconciled to the other Bishops, but vpon condition, that the body should be taken vp, and this at the procurement of the yong Emperour. And for so much, as his reconciliation with the said Bishops did imply also his reconciliation with the Emperour, he that letted the one, letted the other, which was the yong Emperour himself, who though himself would not for respectes (the Bishop being a potent man) vtterly deny to admyt his submission; yet did he procure the stay therof by others (to wit, by the Archbishops and Bishops) vntill he had yielded vnto the condition of taking vp the dead body, & consequētly the thing is true, which I alledged out of Cuspinian that the yong Emperour would not make peace with the Bishop of Leige except the body were taken vp; for so much as himself was he, that had letted that reconciliation, as here appeareth, and procured also as may be supposed the great reprehension which was giuen to the said Bishop and his cōpany, when they were admitted, wherof Crantzius speaketh when he sayth, ad fidem Regis confugiētes grauiter increpati rec

                  That is, By the Sōnes procuremēt, (at whose hands but the Popes? for what needed any procurement by himselfe to himselfe?) the Bishop could not be reconciled (to whom but to the Pope,M Barlowes notorious lyes. who had accursed both Church and Churchmen at Liege, for burying the Emperour?) except the dead body were taken vp againe.
                  
So M. Barlow. Where you may see, that in this only translation of two latyn lines, he hath inserted twice two falsities of his owne, against the Authors owne sense, & meaning. The  first is, that the Emperour had procured the stay of the Bishops reconciliation at the Popes hands, which could not be for the breuity of time, and distance of places, as before hath bene shewed: nor doth it agree with the sense of Cuspinian and other Authors that haue the words mox, fine mora, pridie, and the like. The second is in his second interrogation, 
                  what needed any procurement by himselfe to himself? which is a fallacy, for that a man being desirous to stay a sute, & yet not willing to take all the enuy vpon himselfe, may procure that the stay may seeme to come from others. The  third fallacy is in his other demaund, to whom could not the Bishop of Liege be reconciled, but to the Pope? Yes to the Archbishops, Bishops and others, out of whose communion he was cast forth before, as now hath bene shewed. The fourth vntruth is, that the Pope had excōmunicated both  the Church and all Church-men of Liege, for burying of the Emperour, which cannot be true, as now hath bene declared, for that in so short a space as 2. or 3. dayes, newes could not be sent to Rome, and answere be returned; and much lesse such an Excommunication be sent. And albeit M. Barlow for this last do cyte Viterbiēsis: saying, that he liued in those very times; yet he being an Italiā, & liuing neere 
                     •
                  n hundred yeares after the fact, might be misinformed. And howsoeuer it be, the credit of his owne relation is not to be matched with that of so many other Authors,

But in all this is voluntary fraud, & M. Barlow could not but know it, going about to deceaue his Reader by Equiuocation in the time. For albeit Pope Paschalis did not, nor had time to forbid the first buriall, after the Emperour was d
                     •
                  ad, nor yet commaunded the taking vp therof againe, as now by many witnesses, and other arguments hath bene proued: yet the said body being once taken vp, and carried to Spire, and there placed in the Chappell of S. Asra, in sarcophago lapideo saith Cuspinian, in a tombe of stone, where it remayned fiue yeares, before it was buryed solemnely in the Church of our Lady: In this time (I say) the Pope informed perhaps of more of his enormityes of life, & not to seeme to condemne the fact of so many Archbishops, and Bishops, who had excommunicated him, as among others, Dodechinus Abbas that liued presently after the fact doth testify, and to the terrour of others that should liue, and dye out of the Church in excommunication: for these and other reasons (I say) Pope Paschalis seing the body placed already in a sacred Chappel, was not easily moued for some time, to haue the same solemnly and publikely buryed; though at length his Sonne in respect of his honour, desired and demaunded the same.
               But what is this to proue our chiefe question, whether the said Pope did forbid the first buriall, or commanded him to be digged vp againe, when he was buryed? Where is the Cloud of VVitnesses that should proue this?M. Barlowes cloud of witn

By which words we see, that the Popes perswasiō was not to haue the dead corps digged vp againe, but forsomuch as his Father died in excōmunication, & that his body was now taken vp, he should leaue the same vnburyed (according to the Canons, for terrour of others) and not that he perswaded it to be taken vp, as it was in Leige: or this was not possible, as before hath bene shewed.

Barlow erroneously, or ignorantly doth name him, for that Petrus, & Paulus Diaconus, were different Authors, and liued long one after another:) Baronius, I say, is affirmed to relate out of the said Petrus, that amongst other points in a certaine consultatiō, betweene the Popes Commissioners, and the Emperours, neere vnto Rome in the yeare 1110. it was demaunded by the Emperour, that his Fathers dead body might be interred, and that the Pope denyed the same. But neyther of these points do make against vs, nor in fauour of M. Barlow his assertion, for that we deny not, but that Pope Paschalis, for the reasons before touched, was, after some time that the body had bene taken vp and placed in the Chappell of S. Afra in Spire, vnwilling to yield to the sollemne, and sumptuous reburyall therof, the man dying excommunicate, and out of the Church, and the memory of his many violent actions against the Church, being yet fresh in all mens minds.The ayre cleered of M.

               But it is worth the considering how besides this deuiation, he vseth both Baronius, and Petrus Diaconus, in relating out of their testimonies Pope Paschalis his answere to the yong Emperors Cōmissioners when they proposed the matter, of the solemne burying of his Father some

foure yeares after his body had bene taken vp in Leige, by the said Sonnes commandement. M. Barlow relateth the matter ironic

                   thus. The Pope yielded presently to the demaund, with a strong negatiue, and tells him, it may not be, and giues him his reason, for that he had receiued a terrible iniunction from the Martyrs deceased, and in those places shrined, that he should suffer no wicked persons to be buryed within their Church, for they would not indure it. And all this relateth M. Barlow in a different letter as if they were the very words of the Author,A commō false trick of M. Barlow to set down his owne words in a different letter as if they were the words of the Authour by him cited. and diuers clauses he setteth out in great letters, which cōmonly are great lies, and not found in the Author. I shall set downe the true words as they stand in Baronius, taken out of Petrus Diaconus. Ad hoc respondit Paschalis &c. To this demaund of the Emperour, about the buryall of his Father. Pope Paschalis answered:
The authority of holy Scripture is against this, and the reuerence we beare to diuine miracles doth forbid the same, for that Martyrs themselues now placed in heauen haue dreadfully cōmanded, that the carcasses of haynous wicked men should be cast out of their Chappells, and with whom we haue not had communion in their liues, we may not communicate when they are dead. These are the words of Paschalis verbatim, which M. Barlow hath trymmed to his purpose, as you see.
For if he had set them downe sincerely as he found them in the Authour, they would not haue appeared so ridiculous, as he desired they should appeare, and therefore spiced them after his owne fashion. For first the Pope beginneth not, with that strong negatiue, It may not be, set downe in great letters, but only sayth, that the authority of holy Scriptures was against it, alledging, as may be presumed, to th

               There remayneth then the chiefe iest, brought in by M. Barlow, of the terrible iniunction, which the Pope said he had receaued from the Martyrs deceased and shrined in those places, that he should suffer no wicked persons, within their Churches, for they would not indure

For that Martyrs haue often tymes appeared to good men, and reueiled somewhat touching their owne or other mens bodies, is euident by all Ecclesiasticall histories, wherof we haue example of the Saints Geruasius and Protasius, in S.

               Secondly he doth not say, that the Martyrs commaunded to suffer no wicked persons to be buried within their Churches, for that were hard, that no sort of euill men should be admitted to buriall within Saints Churches: but the apparitions must be presumed to haue bene at certayn particuler places, vpon particuler occasions, where the said Martyrs willed, vt sceleratorum corpora de suis basilicis ei

Paschalis the second of that name Pope, being informed by the said States, of the said necessity, and that Christendome otherwise could not be quieted, nor infinite miseries, calamities and abuses remedied, he concurred with them, with his consent and approbation, though himselfe were at Rome. And the Diet or meeting of the States was held at Mentz, from which Parlament were sent, in the name of the Pope, and all the rest, three Archbishops, to wit, of Mentz, Cullen, and VVormes, all Princes of the Empire,The deposition of Henry the fourth. to take from him, that was prisoner in a little castell neere vnto that place, all the Imperiall ornaments, and ensignes belonging to that State, and to deliuer them ouer to his sonne Henry; and so was it done.

And besides that, his other excesses were so enormous in the eies of all disapassionate men, as he of all others may least seeme worthy to be produced for an example, of such as haue susteined wrong at the hands of the Pope, in regard that all the courses held against him, both by Popes and Princes, may in respect of his outragious demerits seeme to haue bene very myld, moderate, and gentle.

Nor whē the said Sonne took armes against him afterwardes, doth any probable author ascribe it to the Pope, but expresly vnto others, and namely to the three noble men before mentioned out of Cuspinian?

                  FOR another example and proofe, that Popes are wont to allow murthers of Princes is brought in a certayne Oration which Pope Sixtus Quintus is sayd to haue made in the Consistory with admiration and praise of that fact, and that the fryar which committed the murther, should haue beene canonized for the fact, if some Cardinalls out of their wisdome had not resisted the same: whereunto was answered both by me first, and afterward by Cardinall Bellarmine, that no such oration was euer extant in Rome, or els where, but onely amongst the Protestants in forrain Countreys, that wrote against it in their declamatory Inuectiue, intituled Anti Sixtus, who in this against the Pope deserues smal credit.
Onely it is acknowledged that Sixtus in a secret Consistory vpon the first news of the fact, did vtter a certayn speach in admiration of the strange prouidence of almighty God (said I) in chastising

by so vnexpected a way, so

                  To this now M. Barlow replies with great excesse of railing against the Pope, saying, that the Oration was made, & that the Pope therin was like yong Elihu whose words boyled within him for ioy of the fact,
                        Barl. pag. 244.
                      like new wine in a bottle, & with open mouth, & stretched sydes & glorious tearmes he did hyperbolize both the author, manner and fact, and that this Oration was like to haue rec

                     M. Barlows egregious folly.Well then here M. Barlow will needs shew the profundity of his Diunity, and the shallownes of his aduersary. And in very deed he vttereth diuers profundityes, which are so deepe, as I thinke that the Reader will say, when he hath considered of them that himselfe vnderstood them not, when he set them downe, and much lesse that he can iustify them in the Readers vnderstanding. I shall touch some of them in order.
                  
                     M. Barlows ridiculous profundityes discussed.The first profundity that he vttereth, is in his first question or demand, which now yow haue heard, to wit: Can Gods prouidence be strange which is daily and continuall? As though it could not. And in this demand two positions are contained if yow marke the matter, and both of them false: the first, that the prouidence of God in those effectes, which are daly and continuall, can not be strange and admirable: the second, that this euent whereof we intreat to wit, of the King of France his vnexpected chastisement from God, is daily and continuall. And who will not laugh at these two profundityes of M. Barlowes diuinity, neither of them being iustifyable in the eyes of any man of meane capacity? As for the first, I remit him to S. Augustine his learned discourse vpon the miracle of our Sauiour in S. Iohns Ghospell,An excellent discourse of S. Augustine concerning Gods prouidence. when he did feed fiue thousand men with two barley-loaues: vpon which place the sayd learned Father maketh a notable discourse to proue the quite contrary of M. Barlowes assertion, to wit, that many things of Gods prouidence, and heauenly power that fall out daily and continually, are as strange and admirable (mira stupenda) in themselues,

                      as other things that fall out seldome, and by their seldom euents doe seeme more strange; and he guieth an example of the daily gouernmēt of the whole world, the course and continance of the starres, the multiplying of graines of corne in the ground, which is no lesse meruaylous then the multiplying of those two

loaues to the feeding of fiue thousand people: and yet sayth S. Augustine this is wondred at, and the other not wondred at, non quia maius est, sed quia rarum est, not for tha
                        •
                      it is a greater miracle, but for that it falleth out more seldome. So as according to S. Augustine the effects of Gods power and prouidence which are continuall, and fall out daily, are no lesse strange and admirable in themselues, for that they are so common: seing the strangnes therof is not to be vnderstood as M. Barlow would haue it, onely for the rarenes of the euent (for then it should seeme strange that M. Barlow should speake a wise word, because he doth it so seldom) but for some thing which is admirable in the worke it selfe, whether the same be seldome or cōmon: and this also, especially in the iudgment of wise men, as here M. Barlow will seeme to be accounted: but that this first depth of his helpeth him nothing to the attayning of that good opinion.
                  His second depth also or profundity contained in this question, which is, that this euent of King Henry of France his vnexpected chastisment by so an vnimaginable means of a simple fryar, and other like circumstances, is daily and continuall, and consequently neither strange nor admirable, is such a depth, that euery shallow wit will easily discerne it to be both false and fond, and against experience it selfe. For how many such examples can M. Barlow produce to haue happened in many ages togeather, & much lesse daily and continually, and therby to be neyther strange not wonderfull?
                  But now his third profundity standeth in another question immediatly ensuing vpon the former, which is deep indeed, and passeth all sense and vnderstanding.An other strange prof

                     For is any thing strange in Gods prouidence (saith he) which seeth things to come, as if they were present and existent? Which demaund is quite from the purpose: for our question is, whether Gods prouidence in his workes & effects may be called strange and admirable in our eyes, as this of the King of France his punishment; and not whether any thing can be strange or admirable in the eyes of God, and his eternall

prouidence.

                      And why not Syr, as they are the effects of Gods prouidence, & do proceed from the same? As when we see certaine effects of Gods iustice vpon any wicked man; we truly say it is Gods Iustice. And the like when we see certaine eminent works of Gods mercy towards any people, Countrey, or priuate person, we truly say, that it was Gods mercy towards them, and so in all the rest of Gods attributes, though they remayne in God, and be the selfe same thing with God: yet when they worke, and their effects be apparent, we do cōmonly call the effects by the names of the attributes themselues, that is to say, the effects of Gods iustice,Mark this doctrine Syr William. are called Gods Iustice; the effects of his Mercy, are called his Mercyes; of his Wisedome, his Wisdome; of his Prouidence, his Prouidence; which as it is most true, so notwithstanding my words were with more exactnes vttered, then M. Barlow would seeme to take them, I saying that Pope Sixtus Quintus did highly admire the Prouidence of God, in chastising so 
                           •
                        oule a murther: so as I distinguished betweene the cause and the effect, and betweene Gods prouidence, and the chastisement of the King proceeding from the same: wherby is preuented a certain petty florish made by M. Barlow, by naming the definition of Schoolemen to be, that Gods Prouidence is so farre forth called Gods Prouidence, as it remaineth in his secret Counsaile: but when it sheweth it selfe in effects sensible, then is it called Fatum, and not Prouidentia. And for this he cyteth in the margent, Aquinas, summa contra Gentes, but no place at all where (the said worke being great, and contayning foure Bookes, and aboue an hundred and fourescore Chapters) the thing may be found, which is a common shift of his, when he will not be vnderstood, nor found out.
                  But the worst of all is, that the poore man vnderstandeth not one scrap of what he hath read in S. Thomas, or

other Schole-men concerning this matter, for they do not say, as he doth,

                      is called, though improperly saith S. Thomas, Fatum, destiny, for that in respect of Gods immoucable order in his disposition, the second causes doe worke infallibly, though in producing their effects some worke necessarily, some casually, some freely.
                  Hereby then we see first, that M. Barlow vnderstood not his Authors, in saying that Gods Prouidence is so farre forth called Gods Prouidence only, as it remayneth in Gods secret counsaile: for as Saint Thomas in the booke by him alleadged,
                        D. Thom. cont. Gentes lib. 3. cap. 77. saith, Gods Prouidence hath two partes, the one is ordinatio or

Barlow erre grossely in contraposing it to Prouidence,The profoundity of M Barlowes ignorance in School-Diuinity. saying it is called fatum, and not prouidence, wheras fatum is a part of prouidence, as appeareth by that which hath beene said: but yet more grosly doth he erre, when he sayth that when Gods Prouidence doth shew it selfe in sensible effects, it is destiny & not prouidence, for that this Fatum, or destiny consisteth, as it hath beene said, in the order & connexion of the second causes, before they worke their effect, & not in the sensible effects themselues, when they are now produced, and extra causas. And so by this we see in part M. Barlowes profundity in Schoole-diuinity.
                  But we haue not yet done, for that he goeth forward against the Pope, saying: If after the murther of the King of France, the Pope had seene that some really true, not partially

supposed good, had bene effectuated by the Parricyde, that should he truly and only haue ascribed to Gods Prouidence,

To which effect many other places of Scripture might be alleadged: wherby it is euident that the admiring of Gods Prouidence in such actions, is not an allowāce of the thing it selfe, as lawfull in the doer, for that no man will say, that the Apostles did allow the actions of Herod & Pilate, in putting Christ to death, though they do acknowledge it as we haue now seene to haue come by the particuler prouidence of almighty God: & consequently all that idle speach which is here vsed by M.

Barlow know, how he would haue dealt with the sayd Fryar for the same, if he had escaped death, and had bene in his power to punish him: so that all heere is spoken out of passion, and will to calumniate: much also out of errour and ignorance, as hath bene sayd, as namely, that nothing is to be ascribed to Gods Prouidence, but that which to vs seemeth really true, good, and not partially so supposed. So as heere a man is made iudge, what is to be ascribed to Gods Prouidence and what not. In which case I doe not see how the actions of Herod & Pilate could well be ascribed to Gods prouidence, as the Apostles did ascribe them. I do not see also, how M. Barlow can mantaine his assertion here set downe,Ioseph sold into Egvpt by God his prouidence. that the selling of Ioseph into Egypt by his brethren was not by Gods Prouidence, but only as he sayth for the reliefe of his kinred; which the Patriarch Ioseph doth seeme plainly to contradict, when discouering himselfe vnto his brethren, he said: I am your Brother Ioseph whom you sold into Egypt, be not afrayd, nor let it seeme vnto you a hard thing, that you sold me into these Regions, for that God sent me before you into Egypt for your safety. And more plainly in the last of Genesis,

Or will M. Barlowes profound diuinity teach vs, that in the selfe same mysterious actions, one part is subiect to Gods Prouidence, and the other not?

To which my words of answer were: And needeth there noe more Syr but this (quoth I) to condemne both Confessors and Popes, for that no Pope hath called into question or punished any Clergy-man for such like attempts? what if he neuer knew of any such attempt, nor beleiued, that there were any such really designed? What if he neuer heard of any Clergie man accused, except such as were put to death by the Queene herselfe, and so were sufficiently punished, whether they were culpable or innocent?
                  
                  To all which demands of myne M. Barlow answereth with great impatience.

But this I ascribe to his choller. And for that he bringeth no other thing of any moment about this matter,M. Barlowes immodesty. & that I haue spoken largely els where of Queene Elizabeth her affaires; I shall here pretermitt the residue of the trifles, which M. Barlow for lengthening his booke bringeth in, spicing the same euery where with most virulent raylings; as the examples of Squire and Parry, which so often haue beene answered by vs, the former as a meere fiction, for so much as concerned his sending from Spaine into England by F. VValpole the Iesuite for poisoning the Queenes chaire, and the Earle of Essex his saddle; the other a deuise of his owne, to wit of Parry himself, to gaine the Queenes goodwill, and therby some preferment by telling her that he was sent to kill her, by some Catholikes out of the Land: whereas indeed he was neuer trusted by them in farre lesse matters, then in such an enterprize.

And what will the discreet reader hould M. Barlow for his sex? Truly I thinke for one of the most grosse and palpable flatterers that mankind

doth containe: and as for her being the ioy of the Christian world, I meruaile what Christian world he can pretend to meane. For if he will confine the Christian world within the Protestant world, it is, God wote, but a very small part therof, and yet in this Protestant world neyther was she held to be so rare a diamond, or glory of royall Maiestie, nor was she such a ioy vnto them, as there is sayd, which is euident by their writings extant, especially of the Lutherans that misliked her religion, & māner of proceeding, and especially her taking vpon her to be head of the Church, whereat they do laugh, euen vntill this day.
                  And the same or greater dislike was euen in the purer sort of Caluinists, both at Geneua the Mother-Church of that profession, as also throughout all France, Holland, Zeland, Scotland, and England: so as this little Protestant world held her not for such a ioy, nor yet Iewell of theirs, as here by M. Barlow she is described. But as for the Catholike Christian world, for what diamond they held her, and what Ioy they tooke of her, and in her, appeareth well by their bookes which are extant, and will indure till the worlds end: so as the chiefe ground of all these excessiue and exorbitant prayses and flatteries, is no other, as far as I can see, but the volubility of this Ministers tongue for the present: what it may be hereafter vpon the blast of other windes I know not, but it is like that the Weather cock will turne.M.

                  To conclude then (said I) about Queen Elizabeth:
albeit Pius Quintus, & some other Popes did excōmunicate her and cut her of from the body of the Catholike Church by

Ecclesiasticall Censures, in regard of her persecuting Catholicke Religion: yet did I neuer know it hitherto proued, that any Pope procured or consented to any priuate violence against her person: albeit, if the forealleadged Statute of the 28. yeare of King Henry the 8. be true, wherin it is determined both by the King himself, his Counsel and whole Parliament, and by the Archbishop Cranmer, with his Doctors in his Iudiciall Seat of the Arches, that Lady Elizabeth was not legitimate, nor that her mother was euer King Henryes true wife (which once being true, could neuer afterward by any humane power be made vntrue, or amended to the preiudice of a third, rightly by due succession interessed therin:

                           , legitimation. First, that there are many more euidences to proue, that the Pope is Antichrist, then that Queene Elizabeth was illegitimate: this you see what force it hath, & how fit it is vnto this purpose, and therfore he taketh hādfast of another hould, thus: If King
                     
Henry her Father, B. Cranmer, with his Court of Arches, and, body of the Parlament, did sentence her for such; yet the same Father Arches and Parlament, vpon better ground within few yeares renounced the same sentence, and repealed that act.
                     
                        Barl. pag. 253. This now is somewhat, if M. Barlow had cited the Act, or Parlament, or Decree of Bishop Cranmer, or his Arches, or some other particularity, how, or where it was repealed, as I did cite for the contrary of her condemnation Rastals Abridgments.
                  
                  I do find indeed in the booke of Statutes that seauen yeares afterwards, to wit, anno 35. of Henry the eight cap. p
                           •••
                        o, when King Henry had determined in person to go ouer and make warre in France, as in the said Statute is affirmed, and after the death of so many other wyues had married the Lady Katherine Parre widdow, hauing small hope of more issue, he made a certaine declaration of the succession, if in case himselfe and the Prince Edward, and Lady Mary should dye without lawfull issue, to wit, that for lacke of such issue the said Lady Elizabeth should succeed in her turne: but there is no word of her legitimation, nor of the repeale of the foresaid Statute declaratory, of the inualidity of her Fathers and Mothers marriage. And albeit I find diuers other clauses of that Statute 28. Henry 8. cap. 7. repealed by 1. Edward. 6. cap. 12. and primo & secundo Philip. & Mariae cap. 1. & 8. yet do I not find any such repeale made concerning the said illegitimation of Queene Elizabeth. And King Henry himselfe in that Parlament of the 35. cap. 1. doth professe that he had authority by Parlament to giue and dispose the said Imperiall Crowne by his Letter Patent at his wil & pleasure; which sheweth that he might if he would, appoint her to succeed in default of other issue, though she were neuer so much illegitimate; seing all was referred to his owne appointment.
                  But for so much as M. Barlow doth make so light accompt of this sentence of Parlament, as after you shall heare out of his owne contēptible words against the same, I haue thought it good briefely to repeate them heere, and therby shew the weight and moment therof. Thus then

they ly in the Statute.

                  This was the sentence, which is graue and weighty as yow see, for that the whole Parlament affirmeth, that such impediments were discouered by Gods infinite goodnesse, and con

                     essed by Queene Anne in publicke iudgment before the Archbishop Cranmer, sitting vpon the same matter, as by the same it was euidētly conuinced that she was neuer King Henries true wife indeed, and consequently

that the lady Elizabeth was neuer his true and lawfull daughter. And did not this deserue, that M. Barlow should haue brought forth authenticall testimony to the contrary? For if this attestation of the Parlament, King, and Metropolitan were good and true, that Queene Anne was neuer in her life lawfull wife to King Henry, then could not any future Parlament, though neuer so faine it would, afterward make her legitimate, or lawfully giue her the Crowne, in preiudice of the next lawful heire, after Queene Maries death, which at that time was his Maiesties Mother Queene of France and Scotland.
                  
                  But here now M. Barlow would seeme to make some answere to these last words of mine, saying: that being once true, quoth he, to wit the illegitimation, no humā power could make it vntrue to the preiudice of another;Whether Q. Elizabeths bastardy were in body. & then he answereth: If the illegitimation had byn in her bloud, it is true, no law could make it good against the right Heire. And do you grant thus much Syr? That if the illegitimation had bin in her bloud, no law could make it good? Wherein then I pray you was this illegitimation? Was it in her bones, or in her flesh, or skinne? For in one of these foure it must needs be: for asmuch as it descended by her birth from her Father & Mother. But, saith M Barlow,

                  Here now is indeed that begging of the question which without cause it pleaseth M. Barlow sometimes for fashiōs sake to obiect against me. For here our questiō being, whether Queene Elizabeth was sound in bloud or no, he supposeth it for a principle, that it being so, then seeming allegatio

                        The Statute contained, That if any Act should be attēpted tending to the hurt of Queene Elizabeths person, by or for any person, that shall, or may pretend any Title to the Crowne of this Realme, after her Maiesties discease, by any person,
                           Doleman part. 2. p. 117. or with the priuity of any person, that shall, or may pretend Title to the Crowne &c. then all such persōs shalbe excluded and disabled for euer, to haue, or claime the sayd Crowne &c.
                  
                  Hereto M. Barlow answereth now first, that they only in this Act are excluded from Succession, by who

                     e meanes Queene Elizabeths life should be taken away (not sought) and that should not touch their issues, except they had bene any wayes assenting or priuy to the same. But to this may be replyed; that the words now set down in the Statute are cōtrary, which say, that if any act be attēpted tending to the hurt of her Maiesties most Royall person (though not achieued) yet they shalbe excluded. And as for their heires and issues, though in the second part of the Statute, when Queene Elizabeths life should be taken away by such attempts, there is mention of them, that it must be by some assent or priuity of theirs; yet in the former part now alleadged, there is no mention; wherby notwithstanding the sayd pretenders, for whome, or by whose priuityes such attempts only should be made, are condemned of treason, and made incapable of any pretence to the Crowne: which being once effectuated, the consequence doth easily ensue in like manner against their heires and issues. So that this is but a meere trifling matter, brought in for want of other better.

many places of Scriptures, as that of Toby the 4. where it is said:

                  1. Tim 3. I omit diuers other plaine places of Scriptures, and Fathers there alleadged by him, which the Reader may there peruse to his cōfort, shewing euidently, that the conscience of a vertuous life, and good workes, doth giue great confidence to a Christian man, both while he liueth, & especially whe he cōmeth to dye.

                      God; from whome and from whose grace our merits proceed.
So as albeit Cardinall Bellarmine doth confes
                        ••
                     , that good life, and vertuous acts do giue hope, and confidence

of themselues, and that it is lawfull also by the examples of ancient Saints, for good men to comfort themselues with that hope and confidence: yet the surest way is to repose all in the benignity and mercy of almighty God, who giueth all, and is the Authour, aswell of the grace, as of the merits, and fruits of good workes that ensue therof. And thus hath Cardinall Bellarmine fully explicated his mind in this one Chapter, about Confidence in good workes, by soluing the foresaid three different Questions, wherof the one is not contrary to the other, but may all three stand togea
                        ••
                     er. And how then is it likely, that the foresaid proposition, of reposing our confidence in the mercy of God, should be contradictory, as this man saith, to the whol
                           •
                         discourse and current of all his fiue Bookes of Iustification? Let one only sentence be brought forth, out of all his fiue Bookes that is truly contradictory, and I shall say he hath reason in all the rest of his ouerlashing.
               
               This was may declaration, and explication of Card. Bellarmines doctrine, in this point, whether any confidence might be placed in good workes, and what his counsaile is therin. Wherunto, though M. Barlow finding himself vnable to make any substantial reply, do multiply words from the matter, without answering directly, to any one of these points now set downe, and much lesse, to the authorityes of Scriptures, and other proofes alleadged for the same: yet shall we take an accompt of him what he saith, reducing him back againe to these heades, as they lye in my letter, now recited, and see whether they make any iust satisfaction for an answere or no.
               First then, whereas I required, as you haue heard, that for prouing this first contradiction, obiected to Bellarmine that one only sentence, might be brought forth, out of all his fiue bookes of Iustification, that is truly contradictory to the foresaid proposition, counsailing to put our whole confidence in Gods onely mercy: this hitherto is not done, which notwithstanding had beene easy to do, if the whole current of these fiue bookes, as there was said, had beene contradictory to this proposition.

But now let vs see M. Barlowes proofs, out of those bookes in generall.

                      controuersies (about Iustification) may be reduced to these two principall heades, eyther to the quality of our Iustice, that is inherent, not imputatiue: or of the merit, whether it be rewarded

                     or the value of the worke, or of meere grace. And both these by the first word of this proposition (to wit vncertainty) are directly cut off. Thus he. And this we deny: for that the vncertainty of a particuler man, concerning the perfection of his owne merits doth not cut off any of those thinges, which M. Barlow fondly dreameth. Let vs heare his proofe.
               
                  For the vncertainty there mentioned (saith he) is eyther rei, or personae, of the righteousnes it sel

Wherto I answere, that it may be of both in regard of a particular person, for that he may haue some vncertainty, both whether the Iustice that is in him, be perfect, or that himselfe haue performed all circumstances requisite to true merit, though notwithstanding he doth not doubt but that the doctrine of the Catholike Church is true, & most certaine, about the merit of good workes: and that in the said Church, and many of her children, there be true merits, wherin iustly some confidence may be placed, as the Scriptures themselues, and the plaine words, and example of S. Paul before alledged do euidently conuince. For which cause S. Bernard alleadged by Card. Bellarmine doth worthily cry out.

Happy is the Church, vnto whom neither merits are wanting without presuming thereon,M. Barlowes follyes. nor presumption without merits. The Church hath merits, not to presume vpon them, but to deserue Gods fauour by thē. And why had not this bene answered? Let vs heare his further speculation. If the vncertainty (sayth he) be of the thing it self, then is it no true righteousn

him further. For truth, saith he, whether of essence, or of propriety cassiers all vncertain

Barlow, may there not be true ignorance, pride or presumption in many thinges,Much idle babling

I might name, for example, those two words of Essence or Propriety thrust in heere, eyther of ignorance or ostentation, without sense or purpose. For what is truth or propriety, that 
                        •
                     assiers vncertainty? The man would seeme to speake pro

                  oundly, and so exceedeth his owne capacity.
               But let vs heare him further. It is hypocrisy (saith he) not righteousnes, which is not true: if not righteousnes, then not inherēt. Whereunto I answere, that this is not true which he saith first, for that all defect of true righteousnes, maketh not hypocrisy, but onely when a man pretendeth to be iust, and is not. But if a man should doubt, whether his righteousnes be perfect or no (which is our case) then were it no hypocrisy at all, and if it were, then were it inherent hypocrisy in the hypocrite, which is contrary to the other inference of M. Barlow: that if it were not true, and perfect righteousnes, it were not inherent, for that be it true or false, perfect or vnperfect, such as it is, it must needs be inherent in the subiect, which it doth denominate.
               And this is M. Barlowes wise discourse, about the first part of his two-membred proposition, of incertitudo rei, & personae; incertainty of the thing it selfe, or of the person (to wit) of righteousnes it selfe, or of him that hath it. Now he commeth vnto the second, about the person, saying: If the vncertainty be of the person, then the second part of the proposition, concerning merit, is cut of: for merit raiseth a confidence, but where there is no comfort, there can be no confidence; and in vncertainty there is no comfort. Which speach is so prudently vttered, as how many inferences, so many plaine

falsities there be in the same. As first, that where there is no comfort, there can be no confidence. For that Iob in his tribulations, was greatly abandoned of comfort, and yet he said to God, Albeit thou shalt kill me, yet will I hope in thee, and it is an ordinary thing with God to take away oftentimes sensible comforts from good men, who notwithstanding do not loose their confidence in him, and his mercies for the same.
               The other proposition also is false, that in vncertainty there is no com

                  e to the examining of the other three propositions or resolutions of Cardinall Bellarmine before mentioned. In the meane space, you see how well and substantially M. Barlow hath proued hitherto, the contradiction of the third proposition, against his fiue whole bookes of Iustification, wherewith notwithstanding he saith the Cardinall was so pressed, as he gasped for wind, whē I stept in to help him. He steppes, saith he, to Bellarmine, o

                     er whome, as if the Cardinall were gasping for breath vnder the blow he hath recieued for his contradictions, he braues it with some

               This is his confidence, which I grant commeth not of merits, but of onely faith, or rather presumption, and therefore I meane not to impugne it. He saith then concerning my answere before set downe, out of my Letter; first of all, that Bellarmines case standing so bad in it selfe as it did, I m
                     •
                  de it farre worse, by seeking to assist him: and for proof hereof he saith, that I, supposing the Cardinall to handle the controuersy by questions and answeres, wherby it seemes that I neuer read the place myselfe, do summe vp the Chapter in way of Interogatiō, & solution.

Whereto first I answere, that the many particulers, which I do set downe out of that Chapter, whence the proposition is taken, aswell of Scriptures, and other reasons, must needs conuince M. Barlow, that I had read the whole Chapter, and so he cannot say this heere, but against his owne conscience.
               Secondly it is true, that Bellarmine doth not handle those three assertions of his by the way of questions, and solutions, but onely by way of assirmatiue, and resolute propositions. But I thought it best, and more cleare for the English Readers vnderstanding to frame the questions of my self, and take the summe of his said propositions, for answers and solutions to the same. What can M. Ba
                        •
                     low mislike in this? He sayth, that I haue wrongfully set down the Cardinalls meaning, and namely in the first question, and that there is no such thing in the whole Chapter. Let vs examine then this.
               
                  M. Barlows false charge vpon his aduersaty.
                  The first question then, said I, is whether good works in a Christian man doe increase hope, and confidence, by their owne nature, & the promise of reward made vnto them. And Bellarmine answereth that they do, and proueth it by many places of Scripture. Thus I said: & doth not Bellarmine allow this doctrine? Or doth he not teach any such thing in this chapter? Let the reader peruse it, and blush for M. Barlow that affirmeth it. But he giueth an instance saying: Neither Bellarmine, nor any other Deuine, eyther Protestant or Papist, will say good works increase confidence in their owne nature. But good Syr, is your nature such, or lack of grace so great, that you can speake nothing without manifest falshood? I say that good works in a Christian man, do increase hope and confidence, by their owne nature, & the promise of reward made vnto them. I do ioyne two things togeather, you doe separate them and caui
                     •
                  l vpon one onely. I doe speake of good workes in a Christian man, to whom the promise of God is made of reward for good works, you leaue out that, and do speake of good workes as they may be in a Pagan, and for the same cause you say in their own nature, as cōsidered in th
                     ••
                  elus & without Gods grace & promise of reward: I do

                  
                     •
                  ay, that they do increase hope, and cōfidence by their owne 
                        ••
                     ture, and Gods promise of reward. Wherby I doe meane that being workes so qualified, they do of themselues, and by their owne nature of meritorious works increase hope and confidence in the worker, though he for his part, do not place any confidence in them. These then are the first corruptions vsed by M. Barlow vpon my words. Why did he alter them, and not recite them as I set them downe?
               But let vs see a second proofe of his. He alleadgeth Card. Bellarmine against me, saying, that he distinguisheth betweene good workes, and merits, for that all good workes are not meritorious: and so say I too. For that good morall workes, may be in Infidels, as hath bene said, for they may do almsdeeds, & other such good things, but they cannot be meritorious, for that they do not proceed from grace, & haue not the promise to God made vnto thē. What then doth this make against me? Nay harken I pray you what ensueth: he bringeth the wordes of Bellarmine against me, saying: that if good workes should be consider

Barlow of false dealing, that he left out wilfully in my words before recited the clause of the promise of God made vnto them: and so in this he fighteth against himselfe, and discouereth his owne vntrue dealing.
               But hath he any more to say, thinke you, against the first question? or doth he answere one word to the plaine testimony of Scriptures, alleadged out of Toby, Iob, and S. Paul for proofe therof, all cyted by me? No, not so much as one word, and much lesse to those other, that stand in Bellarmines booke, which are more in number, as neyther to the ancient Fathers S. Cyprian, S. Chrysostome, S. Ambrose, S. Augustine, euidently confirming the same, that good and meritorious workes do of themselues comfort the conscience of the doer, by increasing hope, and confidence in him, in respect of the promised reward; yea

albeit he do not of himselfe place any confidence in them, but respecteth onely, and relyeth vpon God almightyes grace & mercy; for that so it may often fall out (and it is to be noted and borne in mind) that a man may haue confidence by good works,Good workes may giue cause of confidēce although a man put no confidence in them, but onely in Gods mercy. and yet place no confidence in good works; for that a vertuous life enriched with many meritorious actions, may of it self giue a man much confidence, for the life to come, though he for his part do not place any confidence therin, but only in Gods mercy: so as now we see the first propositiō of Cardinall Bellarmine to be true, that the confidence of holy m

If one should aske another, whether he had any bread in his house, as Elias for example did aske the poore widdow of Sarepta, euery man of sense seeth that the meaning is,3 R

                        g. 17. whether he haue any bread at all, of any sort soeuer, and not whether he haue all kind of bread: & so if the other do answer, yea, without adding further, it is to be vnderstood, that he answereth according to the meaning of the demaunder, that he hath some bread in his house; but if he should answer, as M. Barlow maketh me to answer, yea, I haue (any) bread, it would import, that he had all sorts of bread.

that are found to be truly such. And in his third proposition, he sayth, that propter incertitudinem propriae iustitiae tutissimu
                        •
                      est &c. for the vncertaynty of our own proper iustice, the safest way is to put all our confidence in the only mercy of God: which, sayth M. Barlow, is contradictory the one to the other; the former affirming, that we must know, that our merits be truly good, before we can put any confidence in them; and the second, that this is vncertaine, & therefore it is most safe to put our confidence only in Gods mercy. Wherto I answere, that if these things be well considered, there is no contradiction; for that the knowledg of our merits, which is required before we can put any iust confidence in them, is a morall knowledg only, such as may stand with some vncertainty, as is to be seene in many things of this world. As for exmple, a man borne now in England, is morally certaine, that he is baptized, for that he is tould so by his parents and others, for that the Ministers do odinarily baptize infants in the Parish where they dwell: but for that he doth not know certainly, whether he that did baptize him, had the intention of the Church, and vsed the forme of words prescribed, it may stand with some vncertainty, whether he be baptized or no. And the like is in marriage, wherein there is morall certainty, that a man and woman that haue liued togeather many yeares in wed-locke, are truly husband and wife: but yet for that there is not absolute assurance, that both parts did consent in hart to that marryage, it may stand with some vncertainty, whether the mariage were good or no. And so in infinite other thinges. And in this our case it is euident, that the knowledg required by the Cardinal of our merits, is but morall, such as may stand with some vncertainty; for though we should know, that we haue giuen almes aboundantly, redeemed captiues, nourished orphans, visited the sicke, and imprisoned, and done other good works cōmended by our Sauiour, that promised life euer lasting to the same: yet because we know not whether we haue done them with all due circumstances or no, it is but a morall knowledg

A man must be acertained that the good works, that he hath done, be truly good before he put cōfidence in them. This is to be vnderstood of morall certainty only; not absolute & infallible. And then againe, no man can assure himself, or know certainly that his works are such, which is to be vnderstood of absolute, and infallible certainty; so as morall certainty, and absolute certainty, being neither the self same thing, but much diffe

Chapter, where the brethren of Ioseph, hauing a naughty will to kill him, God almighty by sending that way the Ismaelite merchāts of Galaad, ga

And surely what miracles M. VVhitakers memory, or skin may worke now after his death (especially if it should be made into a drum, as that of Zisca was) I cannot tell, but sure I am, his tongue, and pen wrought few miracles, whilest he was aliue. And that is euident both by his owne writings, and of others against him, as well in English, as that of M. D. Stapleton, M. Gregory Martyn, and M. VVilliam Reynolds; as also in latin, of the said D.

                  There followeth the fourth Contradiction obiected to Cardinall Bellarmine, about Iudas, where he is accused to

                     ay in one place of his works, to wit, lib. 1 de Pontifice, cap. 12. That Iudas belieued not: and yet in another place, lib. 3. de Iust ficatione c. 14
                        •
                      he sayth, that Iudas was iust, & certainly good, which I say was no contradiction at all, if we respect the two seueral tymes, wherof Card. Bellarmine did speake, prouing out of S. Iohns Ghospell, that Iudas in the beginning was good, and did belieue, but afterward, he became euill, and lost his fayth.
                  This was the summe of my answer: and the Cardinalls booke comming out afterwards, hath the same in effect in these words:

                     Distinguish the tymes, you shal agree the Scriptures. Iudas belieued, and was iust, and good, in the beginning of his election; but afterward he yealded to the tempter, and not only did not belieue, but became a thief also, and betrayed his Lord, and lastly hanged himselfe. So he.
                  And now what do you think, that M. Barlow out of his ingeniosity will find to bring for maintenance, that this was a true contradiction in Bellarmine? Truly he will adventure far to find somewhat, though it be to his owne shame and discredit.

And to the end that his fraud may be more notorious, he writeth the wordes truly, certainly and not belieue, in great letters. But now if you looke vpon Cardinal Bellarmines words, you shall find first, that

he doth not ioyne the aduerbe vere, that is truly righteous, nor the others of certainly good at all; his words are these:

                        ction These are then two willfull corruptions. But the third is much more eminent, that he maketh Bellarmine to say, that notwithstanding that Iudas was truly righteous, and certainely good: yet did he not belieue. Wheras Bellarmine sayth, he did belieue, and so is it set downe in the forme it selfe of the obiected contradiction, saying; that first he did belieue, when he was chosen an Apostle, and that then he was iust: but afterward he lost his faith, and did not belieue. And now wil M. Barlow for making vp of some shew of contradiction against Bellarmine, make him say, that at the one, and the selfe same tyme, Iudas was truly righteous, certaynely good, and yet not belieued. And to shew that this is an absurd proposition, he maketh a long discourse out of Scriptures and Fathers, to proue, that without fayth a man cannot be truly righteous, nor certainely good, as though Cardinall Bellarmine had denied the same.

                  asy and sweet to nourish a mans owne flesh, then to disciplin the same; and more allowed, I doubt not, by M. Barlow, &

such as follow his spirituall directions. But yet about this better place of Scripture auouched by M. Barlow, against whipping, it shall not be amisse to consider somewhat, how rightly it is aleadged, and therby see what becōmeth of Scriptures, when it is once brought into these mens possessions.
               The place is cited togeather, as you see, all in a different letter, as if S. Peter had spoken the whole; & yet in the margent he quoteth Matth. 16. and Ephes. 5. wherby those that are learned vnderstand,
                     Matt. 16. Ephes. 5. that the former words only of Parce tibi: spare your selfe Syr, are of S. Peter, and the later, of nourishing our flesh, against disciplining, is of S Paul. And not to stand vpon the former clause, albeit that it differ from the vulgar translation, surely the place of S. Paul beareth not M. Barlows sense and application against disciplining of our flesh, which is so farre of from the Apostles true drift and meaning, as nothing can be more. His words are these: Husbands ought to loue their wiues, as their owne bodies, and he that loueth his wife, loueth himselfe, for no man euer hated his owne flesh, but nourisheth, and cherisheth the same, euen as Christ the Church. And is this so good a place of Scripture now, as M. Barlow saith, against selfe-whipping, for so much as here the Apostle speaketh of husbands nourishing and cherishing their wiues, as Christ doth his Church? Which though he loued as his owne flesh, yet doth he often whip and chasten, as all men do both see, and feele, that liue in her. This then is impertinent, and nothing to S. Pauls meaning.
               But what? were it not a better place to the contrary, for whipping and chastening a mans owne flesh voluntarily, when the same apostle saith, Cas

But let the words themselues now recited be iudges in the matter, which say, that he was whipped vp & downe the Chapter-house like a schole boy, and glad to escape so too. Doth this import voluntary or inuoluntary whipping? And how then can M. Barlow say, that the Apologer said no such thing? For if he were glad to escape so too, who will not inferre, that he would haue escaped with lesse whipping, if he could, and that therefore the same was in

               There remaine now the other examples of the Emperours Frederick the first, Henry the sixt, and the rest before mentioned, affirmed to haue bene iniuriouslie dealt withall by Popes of their time. All which I might iustly pretermit, as prouing nothing against our case of the Oath, though all were graunted, which hath bene obiected about them. For suppose that some Popes had dealt hardly, and rigorously with some Emperours, Kings, and Princes, that should no more take away his authority, then it should take away any Kings authority, if he should offer iniury to one, or more of his Nobilitie. But besides this, I sayd further in my Letter, that in examining the particulers, I found many exaggerations, additions, wrestings, and vnsincere dealings in the alleaging of these examples. And as for the first of Fredericke,

                     action of the Emperours against the Popes, do write, that he had heard related by some the speach here set downe, that Innoce

               To this also M. Barlow hath very litle to reply, & might wel haue held his peace; but that he saw himselfe obliged to say somwhat. Wherfore first he granteth, that such a mistaking of one Otho for the other, might be in so intricat a Story. Then he goeth about yet further to amēd the matter, by this euasion, that it was not sayd, that Philip was slaine by Otho the Emperour his hands, but that Otho slew him, which may

The Emperour could not auoid, but when he returned into Apulia he perished with poyson, the 27. yeare of his raigne, and 57. of his age, on the very same day that he was made Emperour. For wheras at the towne of Horenzola in Apulia, hauing receaued poyson he was dāgerously sicke, and at length, by diligence of Phisitians, had ouercome the same, he was s

               Thus much I wrote then. Whereunto now M. Barlow endeauoureth to make a large reply, but without any re

Barlow tell vs which we shall belieue: for that, he recouered, and died of the same poyson, is a cleere contradiction, and then I shall answere him further.

                  e of this Emperour. And therefore that he should dye of poyson, is of all the rest most improbable: & it argueth small sincerity in M.

Barlow goeth about to proue thus.

He saith, that the Pope was reported to hyre one to poyson the Emperour, but he telleth not, who that one was, though his Author doth, and maketh a large declaration therof in this very place cited by M. Barlow, and sayth, it is was Petrus de Vineis, as afterwards shall be further declared, when we come to discusse M. Barlows inf

I shal for once be content exactly to examine them both, and see what weight, or moment they carry with them, and whether they be sure foundations to build so much vpon, as M. Barlow would make them. I shal therfore for better perspicuity, set downe his owne words at large, and then after examine them part by part.
               Well then that the Pope procured the Emperors death by poyson, he goeth about to proue in this manner.
The presumptions (saith he) are very strong for it;M. Barlows lying discourse p. 292. for sure it is, that the Pope hated him so extremely, vt noc

                  By priuate letters (saith he) which were intercepted by the Emperour, and wherof he complaines, the Pope dealt with the Sarracens, to make no truce with the Emperour, nor to deliuer the Crowne vnto him though he should win it by Conquest. So he. This tale is of it selfe so incredible, and deuoid of all shaddow,M. Barlows other lyes. or likelyhood of truth, as there needeth no other proofe besides the bare narration thereof to refuse it: and M. Barlow guilty, as it should seeme, of forgery, citeth no Author for the same, vnles he referr vs vnto Vrspergensis, whome in the beginning of this paragraph he cyteth thus: Vide haec omnia apud Vrsp
                        •
                     rgensem; see all these thinges in Vrspergensis. But of this matter, I must tell him, that Vrspergensis, hath not one syllable, and therefore me thinkes, some other Authour should haue bene cited either in text, or margēt. The most that I can find hereof, is in a letter of the Emperours, to Richard Earle of Cornwall, vnto which it may be M. Barl. hath relation, where amongst other complaintes, the Emperor saith the Popes Nuntius & Legates in Syria dealt by secret letters with the Soldan, that he should not render to the Emperour the Holy-Land, which by right was due vnto him: but, that he should make no truce with him, nor yeald him the Crowne though he should win it by Conquest (which are M. Barlows words) there is no mention: and therfore I shall beleiue M. Barlow, as I shall see his proofes, hauing already found him so false in all other Authors whom he hath cited.
               But graunting all to be true, to wit, that Fredericke obiected this thing, and in this manner against the Pope; yet it may be presumed that M. Barlow could not but know the answer of the said Pope,

And moreouer the vertuous life of Gregory, and the wickednes of the Emperour being knowne to all, this answer of the Pope to this and other such imputations, being published and spread ouer Christendom,

                  And when the Emperour sent letters of ioyfull aduertisement to the Pope of his victorie, & truce taken with the Turke, the Pope threw away his letters in disdaine, & caused it to be giuen out through the Empire, that the Emperour was dead: vpon which rumor, there grew a de

And are these particulers, or any one of thē which you haue so much vrged, for this purpose, to be verified of Innocentius?

               Pope Gregory the ninth armed the Emperours soulddiers against him, caused a treacherous reuolt from him, whilest he was fighting the Lords battails, betrayed him

into the mouth of Christs sworne enemies &c. Ergo twenty yeares and more after this, Pope Innocentius the 4. hired one to poyson him.
               This is M. Barlowes violent inducement, set downe in forme, to prooue Pope Innocentius the 4. to be guilty of poysoning the Emperour. And what force it hath, I shall not need to declare. For the argument is so ridiculous and transparent, as there is no child so simple, that doth not see through it. And truly M. Barlow cannot here excuse himselfe in my iudgment from willfull malice, that alleaging all this out of Vrspergensis, who ended his historie with the yeare 1228. or the beginning of the next, at what time Pope Gregory liued,Malicious cosenage in M. Barlow. as he did for 12. yeares after, would notwithstanding lay it all vpon Innocentius the 4. for which cause as it may be thought, he dissembled Pope Gregories name throughout al his relation, which he could not but see expressed in his Author. And what will you say to such malicious follie, or foolish malice?

Let vs see then what demonstratiue proofs, and irrefutable arguments he will bring to

proue, what he intendeth.

                        Barlow pag. 291. for that he saied, And Cuspinian agreeth with them (to wit Petrus de Vineis, and Nauclerus) that the Emperour recouering by the help of Phisuians, from the poison, Manfred tooke a shorter course with him,

And how then doth he relate the procurers of the poyson doubtfully, and the instrument certainely? I thinke M. Barlow vseth to write sometimes in his sleepe; for had he bene waking, he would not (as I suppose) euer haue bene so shameles, or ignorant, as so to corrupt or mistake the Authors which he citeth, in so base a manner. And truly Cuspinian himself seemeth to haue dreamed in these few lines here cited, as before I haue noted,M. Barlow and his Author Cuspinian taxed. for hauing said veneno peryt, he perished or died with poyson, yet presently after as you see, he saith, that by diligence of Phisitians he ouercame the same, and afterwards was stifeled. And with such sleepers, and dreamers are we troubled with all, who not seeking to finde out, or deliuer the truth in the matters they handle, do contradict themselues, and runne into grosse, and palpable absurdities. But let vs proceed.
                  The second maine pillar, vpon which M. Barlow relieth for proofe of the Popes poisoning of the Emperour Frederick, is Matthew Paris, an English man, who (saith M. Barlow) affirmeth, that the Emperour hauing discouered a poyson intēded & prepared, or him by his trustiest attendan

Barlow. who hauing set downe the storie, how the Emperour discouered the treachery of Petrus de Vineis, and his intent to poyson him, setteth also downe the said Emperours complaint, in these wordes: Vae mihi contra quem propria pugnant viscera &c.
                  
                  Wo be to me, against whom my owne bowells doe fight.
                        Matth. Paris in an. 1249. 
                     Peter whom I beleyued to haue bene a rocke, & the half of my soule, hath by treason sought my life.
And lo, the Pope whom the Empire hath exalted of nothing, and enriched vnder my Noble predecessors, doth go about to exterminate it, and seekes to ouerthrow me the Gouernour of the same declining Empire. Whom shall I trust? Where shal I be safe &c?
So Matthew Paris: whom you see auerreth not, as M. Barlow sayth he doth, that the Emperour found it to be the Popes doing: for all that can be truly gathered out of these wordes, is, that the Emperour suspected some such thing in the Pope. And so far is Matthew Paris from affirming that it was found to be true, that hauing said that the Popes fame was therby much blemished; he addeth this restrictiue clause, as from himself, Veritatem tamen nouit Deus secretorum scutator infallibilis: but God knoweth the truth, who is the infallible searcher of secrets, as though he had sayd, that this matter had no other ground then the Emperours suspition, and slaunder of his scismatical followers, for had there bene but any apparent proof therof, it would haue bene layed open to the vttermost. And to confirme this, the same Author a little before the wordes now rehearsed, saith, that the enemies of the Church gaue out, that the Pope had sought to corrupt Petrus de Vineis to poyson the Emperour. So then to conclude, wheras out of this Author M. Barlow saith, that Fredericke vpon examination found it to be the Popos doing, there is no such thing to be found: that which we find, is that M. Barlow either corrupteth, or corruptly alleadgeth all the Authors which he dealeth with.
                  But now you may thinke, that he hath kept a sure card for the last, and bringeth forth an Author without all checke or controll, who with his verie name will ouerbeare

all opposition: and indeed he is here discribed as an vnconquerable Giant, and as such a one, who by himselfe may stand for thousandes: and this man forsooth is Petrus de Vineis,
                     Petrus de Vineis magnified by M. Barlow. of whom M. Barlow speaketh th

And againe after: VVho was euer about him, wrote truly, & is an Author approued. And yet further: In whome Cuspinian, an Authenticall writer, ver

Not Innocentius the Pope, who refuted him: not the Italians, who contradicted him: nor yet all other Authors, that condemned his partiality, and falshood: in so much, as if we will beleiue M. Barlow, he is an Author of infallible truth, notwithstanding he were a professed enemy of the Pope, and sworne seruant of the Emperour. And if we belieue other Authors, a very corrupt man,

                  What then shall we say to this ground, or rather to this strong foundation, & inuincible bulwarke? The words of this Author are plaine,

Truly no more thē there is alledged to proue that Fredericke went about to poyson the Pope. And is not this per

Barlow will haue him, & let his litle finger be as great as Alexanders backe, yet sure I am that for the poysoning & death of Fredericke, eyther by the Pope or any other, he will stand for nothing els but to condemne M. Barlow, and all others who layne so much vpon him, of fraud, or folly, or worse dealing, which I trust to make so euident & cleere, as it is cleer & euident M. Barlow neuer saw one to write after that his eies and braines were out, his body cold, and his bones rotten.
                  And first I suppose, which M. Barlow doth freely grant me, that this Petrus de Vineis was Secretary vnto Fredericke and continually about him; but certaine it is, by vniforme consent of all Authors of those tymes, that the same Petrus de Vineis was dead a yeare at least before the Emperour, and therefore could testify nothing of his death, vnles he wrote by Prophesy: for by the Emperors commaundment for treason eyther indeed intended, or pretended only, as I haue said, he had his eyes put out, and being committed to prison, he knocked out his owne braines; which besides the testimony of Catholike Authors, as

Barlow should haue alleadged some Author for the same; but that he saw all Authors, reason, & truth it selfe to stand against him in this point.
                  Wherefore seeing so many to stand for me, in defence of this truth, and no one man that I haue seene to deny the same, I may with more reason challenge the priuiledg of Gods rule of two witnesses against M.

                     The rule of Almighty God is, that is the testimony of two witnesses speake with one mouth, in ore duorum, it shalbe an establishment: and that is more, then an apparence of truth. In the case of Frederick the second,

vpon the credit of two witnesses, which yet in the case of Susanna proued not so certaine, & much lesse in the matter we now talke of, wherin is diuersitie of opinions, and neither of the two Authors auoucheth it for certainly true, as in the next Paragraph we shall shew. In the meane time, this rule will serue most APPARENTLY and CERTAINLY also,M. Barlow by Gods rule condēned of forgery to condemne M. Barlow, seeing that here not only in ore duorum, in the mouth of two, but of seauen or eight times as many, we haue proued M.

                  Al that he hath for proof of his idle conceipt, is a seely coniecture, set downe in a few wordes, and those also so obscure, as they require some attention in the reader to vnderstand them, if not Natatorem Delium, to interpret them. For thus he sayth: A man shall oftentimes heare his own seruants cursing him, sayth King Salomon: and no fitter instance can be giuen, them of this Emperour in that case: for he differed not much from the Historians name, whom the Pope hired once to poyson this Emperour (if Parisiensis do not erre, or deceaue his Reader) for his name (being of neere place, & trust about the Emperour, euen for his soule) was Petrus de Vinea, that was so HIRED, and plotted withall. This is all, and very intritate also, as you see. But his sense, & meaning is (if I mistake him not) to make a difference where there is no diuersity, in separating one & the self same man from himselfe, to wit Petrus de Vineis, from Petrus de Vinea, which is all one. But this is not the first error which M. Barlow hath committed in this manner of Metamorphosis,

fauour with him, was sent to the Councell of Lyons with Thaddaeus Sinuessanus, had his eyes pulled out for treason, & finally knockt out his owne braines: only I must confess, that none of these Authors, vnder the one or other name, do mention of his miraculous writing of Frederikes death, after his eyes & braynes were out, but left that as a meere lying fiction to be registred alone by M. Barlow.
                  
                  This then being so, whereof I thinke no learned man, that hath read the Histories can make any doubt, to wit, that Petrus de Vinea, and de Vineis is but one mans name, who was put to death by the Emperour Frederick; it must needes follow (as I haue said) that, that Epistle, or what else so euer, vnder his name, which mentioneth the poysoning or death of the Emperour (if there be any such) to be bastard, counterfait, and forged by some schismaticall or hereticall writer, who the better to deceaue the Reader would vse the cloke, and authority of the name of Petrus de Vineis, and M.

And the like he might haue seene in Manutius, who explicating the prouerb, sayth, qui res natura diuersas eodem titulo complectuntur: who comprize things of different natures vnder one title. And with them agreeth Calepine. But it is M. Barlows good fortune to be mistaken in all things, be it

of Historie, Humanity, Philosophy, or Diuinity. But not to stand longer on these trifles, but to draw to an end of the whole matter, in which M. Barlows manifold mistakinges haue made me the longer, it will not be amisse for conclusion hereof, to lay good Reader, before thine eyes, all the errors & vntruthes, that in this matter only M. Barlow hath committed, by which thou wilt easily consecture, how great a bulk I had bene forced to write, if I should haue bene so particuler in all other pointes, which he handleth, as I haue bene in this: but I thought it sufficient for a tast to exemplyfie only, in some few, omitting the rest, as being loath to loose good tyme in searching so narrowly into such false and friuolous matters.
                  Vntrue then it is, that the Emperor was excommunicated vpon sleyght pretences,M. Barlows vntruthes heaped togeather as the Councell of Lyons, and all other Authors do testifie. It is vntrue, that the Emperour was sent into the Holy Land, that the Pope might rifle his State at home. Thirdly it is vntrue, that the Emperour stayed for sicknes, which (euen by them who were with the Emperour) was testified to be but seigned. Againe it is not true, that for the same stay he was excōmunicated, but for his returne with the Nauie, after he had set forth to sea. Fiftly Vrspergensis sayth not, that the Pope way-lied the coastes of Verona and Millaine, and tooke order that the Souldiers should be spoyled. Sixtly, that the Pope kept back all supply of forces from the Holy-Land whiles Fredericke was there, which his owne Author saith was but only in Lombardy and Apulia. Seauenthly that the Emperour perfourmed his vow, and promise by his voyage to Hierusalem

Eightly, that the Pope commaunded the Christians in Asia to leaue the Emperor to the Turkes malice, & that Nauclerus doth affirme the same. Ninthly. Blondus is belyed, whom M. Barlow will haue to auouch, that the Pope sent secret letters to the Patriarch of Hierusalem, to rebell against Fredericke; but Blondus hath returned him a Writ of Non est inuentus in baliu

And to make vp a full Iury of twelue, to cry guilty at the barre against M. Barlow, a most notorious vntruth it is, that these thinges were done by Innocentius, as M. Barlow auoucheth.
                  And these being all the strong presumptions, and violent inducements, that are brought by him to proue the Popes poysoning of the Emperour, and proued by me to be all lyes, slaunders, and corruptions, I leaue it to the Readers iudgment to determine whether they be not strong presūptions, & violent inducements rather of M

Barlow would haue them seeme) of this counterfait poysoning, which wee now haue both euicted, and demonstrated to be nothing else, but open vntruthes: to wit, that Cuspinian should say, that Mansredus poysoned the Emperour: that the Emperour died of the poyson, which lye we haue shewed to be ioyned with a grosse contradiction of M.

therof by this example.
                  It was obiected by me, that Petrus de Vineis was a seruant of Frederick, and sworne enemy to the Pope. To this M. Barlow giueth three answeres:Three of M. Barlows answeres examined. first that so were S

And not to seeke further for an exāple in this kind of Sycophancy, besides many others which before haue bene alleadged, the very next ensuing words after those of his charge against Pope Innocentius, most euidently confirme the same, wherin all his poore wit and skill, is bent to flatter his Maiesty to the vttermost.

Neither doth Cuspinian infinuate any such thing out of Petrus de Vineis, as M. Barlow

                  And to this we may adioyne a very solemne foolery, which followeth in the very next page, where forsooth he reiecteth Blondus, by the same reason, by which he here iustifies Petrus de Vineis,

                  The third answer then, which of all the rest is most  silly, and simple, M. Barlow fetreth downe thus: Thirdly saith he,A seely reason of M. Barl. to iustifie Petrus de Vineis. 
                     neither did Vineis write this as a seruant, but as an Historian, who in all his tract must haue m

                        Barlow pag. 296. for I find no such history of his, nor any record therof, only I find recorded his Epistles, as well in his owne name, as the Emperors, & therfore as may be presumed, written by him more like a Seruant, then an Historian. And truly this reason of M. Barlows seemes to iustify all histories, that euer were written, seeing that as he saith, an Historian must alwaies haue an eye to the truth, and therfore Petrus de Vineis, when he wrot the history of the Emperour, did write the truth, & so did Philostratus, when he wrote of Apolonius Tranaeus, & Gessrey of Monmouth in setting downe the Ge

                  These are the reasons of M. Barlow, why Petrus de Vineis should be credited against Innocentius, but that Inuocentius should not be beleiued in his owne case, writing an Apology for himselfe against Petrus de Vineis. This he would

seeme to proue, harken I pray thee good Reader, if thou canst without laughter, for M. Barlow will play the Vice in kind.A ridiculous exception of M. Barlow against Innocētius. 
                     But did the Pope (saith he) write these bookes in defence of himself, to consute Petrus de Vineis? Surely that is an argument that he was guilty. And why, good M. Barlow? Suspitionem (saith he) mihi facit nimia diligentia, saith S. Hierome: Pr

                        mptitude of excuse implieth a consciousnes of the fault. Yea what sayth the same Father of Iudas the Traytor, when our Sauiour told his disciples that one of them should betray him, and all the rest of the Apostles (as stroken with griefe) pluck their hands from the dish, forbidding meate to their mouths, & Iudas only thrust in his hand. This he did, vt audacia bonam conscientiam mentiretur, that therby he might dissemble, & thinke to perswad his INNOCENCY with meere bouldnes. So he. And is not this good stuffe? Who euer heard wise man before draw an argument to proue one to be faulty for that he wrot in his owne defence? For by this reason S. Athanasius, S. Basil, S. Gregory Nazianzen, who wrote Apologies for themselues against their calūniators, shal also be guilty of these crymes, wherewith they were charged by their aduersaries: neither shall the Emperour Fredericke himself be free, who wrote diuers Epistles in his owne defence, as euery where we find: yea your whole Church of Englād, M. Barlow, shalbe condemned, who wrote a lying Apology for it selfe, refuted by D. Harding, and shamefully defended by your Brother, the Superintendent of Salisbury, M. Iohn I

This is his reason (if so it may be tearmed) out of which it followes, that the sooner a man offers to cleare himselfe, the more he is to be suspected as guilty therof: which who seeth not how ridiculous it is: and moreouer I would faine know how, or vpon what ground, M. Barlow doth gather, that Innocentius was so prompt, or forward in answering,

                  If the Pope be not lyable to these former pretended Imputations, of which we haue now fully cleared him,M. Barlows charge against Innocentius only in generalities. I would, as before I haue said, faine know what these acts were, that are here sayd to be descried, any could no longer be hid: for in Cuspinian (this Popes professed aduersary) I find no such personall crime obiected against him, but only the contention betwene him and the Emperour, for which the whole Councell of Lyons, which represented the Church at that time, doth cleare him, in condemning Fredericke: and all Authors, excepting one or two set out by Heretickes, do not only cleare him, but also much commend him; and out of Petrus de Vineis, M. Barlow citeth nothing, wheras, me thinks, in so odious a calumniation, some instance should haue bene produced, some Author alleadged, and things more specified, t

This man was made memorable & famous to all posterity, as well for his exquisite learning, wherof he left notable monuments,

as also for his excellent piety, his noble deserts towardes the Weale publicke of Christendome, and continuall, and infatigable labours, whose knowne vertue was so admired, and beleiued of all men, that bewayling his losse, they did commonly say, talem Virum aut numquam nasci, aut numquam mori oportuisse, that so worthy a man either should neuer haue bene borne, or neuer haue died.
So he.

Barlow, vnles he make some great chang of himself from that which at the present he is sayd to be.

                     For the other vice of licentious life, & that in so high a degree as little beseemed his Imperiall Maiesty, there are many proofes; for with Cuspinian agreeth Messia, in the life of Fredericke, Ciaconius in the life of Innocentius, Blondus out of the relation of one who then liued, and wrote what he saw and knew, Nauclerus, Crantzius, Huldericus Mutius, Crusius, Colenutius, and out of him Iohn Fox, who setteth downe the matter somwhat nicely, with a Ministeriall diminitiue phrase, or (to vse M.

So he.
                  And truly I smyled when I read this clause, some fault of concupiscence, in Fox. For seeing that euen in the regenerate in the Protestants opinion, concupiscence is a sinne, and so still remaineth after Baptisme, why is it here imputed as a speciall fault in this Emperor more then in other men, seeing that all men are as guilty therof as he, as hauing it al alike engendred within thē? But he meaneth his wāton life, which he would closely couer with the generall and gentle title of Concupiscence.

                  And to shew further the base mind of this lasciuious Emperour,
                     A very base and barbarous example. besides his owne personall misbehauiour in this filthines, Crantzius relateth one example of his beastlines, as may alone shew how far this his faulty Concupiscence did extend it self.
For to gratifie the Turkes (saith Crantzius) as well those who followed him in his warres,
                           Crantz. l. 8. Saxon. cap. 10. as those that liued in Africk, he not only suffered, but procured throughout all Sicily and his kingdome of Italy, the fairest women, and maidens which the Turkes lusted after, to be taken from their parents bosome, and married wiues euen out of their husbands armes to be giuen vnto them.
So he. And was not this a vertuous man trow you; who to pleasure the Turkes, sworn enemies of Christ, would thus deale with Christians? And doth not this man deserue to be credited, speaking in his owne behalfe before Pope, all writers, and whatsoeuer other testimony?
                  But indeed this dealing was conforme to his deuotion, for he who so vilely esteemed of our Sauiour himself, no meruaile if in his other behauiour he were so irreligious, base and wicked:The blasphemou

For the first hath many fables, contradictions, railinges, and dogmaticall assertions, which little beseeme a religious spirit, or true Catholike, which at least he was knowen to be: and therfore as well this Matthew, as the other, being set out by Heretikes, and printed at London, by order, as I haue bene informed, from the Superintendēt of Canterbury that then was, and no other ancient copie being extant that I can heare of, that might be conferred with this in print, it is very likely, that many thinges which are now vrged against vs, are not the wordes of Matthew Paris the Monke, but of Matthew Parker of Canterbury: and he who shal

By profession Cuspinian was a Phisitian, & knew perhaps how to frame his potions, according to the complexion of the receauers, and therfore this Frederick being descēded as some thinke, or at least by marirage neerly allied to the House of Austria, he thought by making the most of him, to gratify both Maximilian his maister, and yong Charles the fifth of the same family, yet seeing he neuer set forth this booke, but left it imperfect, vncorrected, full of errors &c. & that afterwards it was first published by Nicolas Gerbelius, a Protestāt-brother of Strasburge, as may be presumed, who printed it in the yeare 1540. we may well thinke, that it was sauced by the setter forth, according to the new Ghospell, and good appetite of them of his owne profession.

Barlowes Reply therunto; I shall not need to adioyne any more. Wherfore I will only content my self with two censures which I find in two Authors of him, to wit, in S.

excuse of him, by him he was condemned, for whome he had offended both God and the Church. So he. And Tritemius thus writeth of him,

                  OF THE EMPEROVR Fredericke the first, whose picture was said to haue bene sent to the Soldan by Pope Alexander the third. And of the charge of Alexander the sixt, touching the death of Zizimus or Gemen, M. Barlows innocent Turke. §. III.
                  METHOD and rules of learning require, that euery thing be put downe in his due place and order, and therfore me thinks that Fredericke the first should by all reason, haue bene mentioned before the second Fredericke his successour, especially seeing that there is another obiection made a litle before out of this very Emperour and Pope, wherunto this might well haue bene annexed, had it not

bene that the margent of the Apology was to be filled with citations, and the text with variety of examples, to make Popes more odious. But the transposition we
                        •
                     e pardonable, if the thing auouched were true, and the Reader not abused by these forged calumniations, who through the heat and heape of many words, is made to conceaue, that M. Barlow sayth much to the purpose, and with great sincerity: wheras all he hath, is nothing else but vaine Thrasonicall ostentation, impudent lying, & that which alwaies accōpanieth the loose liberty of a licentious tongue, exorbitant rayling against all sorts, and degrees of men whatsoeuer. And this, as it hath bene euery where already shewed: so shall it be more in this, and the other ensuing Chapters, though with much more breuity then the former, least both this Chapter and the whole booke, be drawne forth to greater prolixity and length, then I haue purposed with myselfe that it should be: which only reason hath made me in other places, to leaue more aduantages, then I might haue taken against M. Barlow; albeit I haue taken more then I thinke will stand with his credit, or honesty, if yet he haue any part or parcell of the one or the other left him.
                  But let vs heare him speake, if he can without lying, which here I assure you he will not, but begin with a round one, at the very first entrance. For thus he sayth:

                     Another instance (saith he) obiected

                        y his Maiesty (which pincheth their holy Father to the quicke) is of that Pope, who when Emperour Fredericke was in the Holy-Land,

                        earing that his returne would be some annoyance to the Romish Sea) betraied him to the Soldan, to whome he directs his priuate letters, and with them also sent the Emperours picture, in case the Soldan should mistake his Person. So M. Barlow.
                     A cluster of lies in M. Barlow. And least any man should misdoubt of the certainty of this thing, he saith, that I made no answere therunto, because in likelihood I saw it vncontrollable. But I hope so now to check and controle the same, as all indifferent Readers shall cry shame on M. Barlows ignorance and impudency, who in so false and forged a matter, reposeth so great confidence, as to affirme, that it pinchet
                           •
                        
                        
the Pope to the quicke, and is incontrollable.
                  
                  And to answere first in general to this brutish charge; I say, that it is full of malice, deuoid of truth, and wholy founded vpon lyes, which I shall by such euident demonstration euince, as better proofe in such a matter cannot be required, or had. But first I must aduertise thee, gentle Reader, that reason and modesty required on M. Barlows behalfe in so odious and iniurious an accusation, that some Author, record, or proofe should haue bene produced, for confirmation of the same, especially seeing Iouius who was first cited in the Latin and English Apology, was by me denyed to haue any one word therof. But insteed of prouing this, M. Barlow telleth vs, how Saul sought for his fathers Asses, and found thē not in Salila, nor Salim. But howsoeuer he sought and found them not there, here I am sure we haue found one at least, if to play the formall foole, as M. Barlow doth often, may deserue that title. But let vs examine the thing it selfe.
                  The Pope, who is charged in the Apology of the first and second edition, as well in the English as Latin copies,Alexāder the third calumniated. is Alexander the third, much by all Authors, as well of that time, as of the ensuing ages praised both for a worthy Pastour, and excellent man,

Bernard giueth an honourable testimony of his demeanour before he was eyther Pope or Cardinall, as also the French Author Robertus de Monte doth after his death. And did this man I pray you send these letters and Frederickes picture to the Soldan? It is incredible; and no otherwise is it here verified, then by a bare assertion of M. Barlow, by which kind of proof, I may as well proue him to be a Souldan, or Turke, as he doth, that there was euer any such letter or picture sent. And truly, there is as much ground for the one, as for the other: and as well shall I be able to shew, that this matter betweene Frederick and Alexander is a meere counterfait fiction, as euer he shalbe able to shew, that he is not a Souldan (for of his being a Turke I will not so much contend, seeing him so

earnest in defence of Gemin.) And truly if in any thing, the vniforme consent of all historiographers be to be heard, it is not to be reiected in this, but it were to long and vnnecessary a labour to lay downe, what all of them haue written in this affaire. It shall suffice me to alleadge, that wherein they agree with thē who then liued, as Nubrigensis, Houeden, Robertus de Monte, & Nicetas the Grecian, or not long after, as the two Matthewes, to whome I will of Protestāt writers ad Huldericus Mutius a Zuinglian, & Martinus Crusius a Lutheran, that M. Barlow may the better perceaue how exorbitant his malice and folly is, that wil haue that passe for vncontrollable, which by all manner of writers is contradicted.

                     rances in Greece, at Isaacius his hands, who was then Emperour of the East; it must needes follow, that it was very late in that yeare before euer he could ariue into the holy Land. In so much, as Nicetas a Greeke Historiographer then liuing, saith that he came not thither vntill the beginning of the next yeare, which as it was the first of his arriuall there; so was it the last of his life, to wit, the yeare 1190. as we haue said, and all the Authors here cited doe testifie.
                  All which if we suppose (and who, against the authority of such manner of witnesses, can make any doubt or exception?) and withall consider what, not only all these English writers, with the Protestantes, but all other Authors besides extant before these later controuersies in religion were raysed, do write of the time of the death of Pope Alexander the third, which by the vniforme testimony of them all (two only

                     xcepted, who put it a yeare later) fell out in the yeare 1181. he I say who shall consider all this, will blush for very shame, if he be M. Barlows friend, to heare him thus resolutly to affirme, That when Frederick was in the Holy-land fighting in Christes quarrell, fearing that his returne would be some annoyance to the Romish Sea, the Pope betraied him to the Soldan &c. For how I pray you could he betray Fredericke, being in the Holy-Land, who was dead eight yeares and more, before euer he came thither? For now we haue shewed that Pope Alexander the third died in the yeare 1181. which was s

                     taile, and more then 8. before his arriuall into Armenia where he was drowned. And here to vrge M. Barlow with a Dilemma: Eyther he knew this diuersity of time, I meanne of the Popes death, and Frederickes expedition for the holy-land, when he wrot his booke, or he knew it not. If the first; then is he very shameles, and malicious, who contrary to his owne knowledge and conscience would deceaue his Reader in a printed booke, and that in so triumphant manner, as you haue heard. If he knew it not; then truly he is very ignorant, and vnworthy to write in defence of so great a Monarch as his Maiestie is; and withall very negligent, that would not so much as see, & search his Authors; or els very foolish and simple, if he would haue vs belieue him without any other authority, or proofe then his bare word, which I thinke of his next neighbours will not be taken for much.
                  And by this example the Reader may know how hereafter to trust him in other places, when he vaunteth and braggeth of aduantages, for these are but suddaine pangs, wherunto the desperatenes of his cause doth driue him, when no other answere can be made. For what is true, or vntrue,

And this priuiledge the poore man must confesse, or else cry guilty against himselfe, of as many lyes, as there be lines in his accusation (to speake the least) for here is no pinching instance, but a forged fiction, no betraying of the Emperour, whiles he was in the Holy-Land, no letters, no pictures, no Pope Alexander then liuing, noe feare of annoyance to the Romish Sea, with which at that time Frederick was vnited in all loue and freindship, & at Pope Clements request vndertoke that enterprize, which M. Barlow truly calleth the fighting in Christes quarrell, though it were not for the Protestant Ghospell, but for the preseruation of the Catholicke faith in the Holy-Land, which this Minister and his Mates in their Bedlam bookes, and Sermons call Idolatry

onely bare assertions, as M. Barlow doth in this without further authority, coniecture, or proofe, how would our clamorous English Clergy cry out against the same? How would they exaggerate such an aduantage? And yet here in a most heynous accusation against all writers, without all proof, we must stand to M. Barlows bare assertion, or else to two moderne writers, both heretikes, both enemies, to wit Iohn Bale, and Simon Scardius, who (especially the former for his notorious lying, and lasciuious scurrilitie) with vs, the Lutherans, & all learned Protestants are of as much credit, as Robin-Hood, and Little-Iohn.

Let vs likewise see how prudent his answer is, or rather euasion. The Printer, sayth he, displaced the quotation, giuing it a higher roome by fiue lines in the page then he should haue done, for that it concerned the next story imediatly following.

For this speach of myne, which M. Barlow termeth a yerking comparison of Kings with Popes (though I know not why) he inueigheth greatly against me,
alleadging first out of Seneca, That art cannot long estrange nature, as though out of Nature belike, I were inclyned to make such comparisons, and then likening me to Venus her Cat, that was trickt vp (as he sayth) like a wayting-mayde, but yet she discouered her self when she saw a mouse:

                  And do you see his vanytie? Is the very naming of Kings, especially in so honourable a sense, as I doe, for mayntenance of their authority,M. Barlowes sicophancy sufficient to make retorting vpon Kings? Or is the mentioning of Kings in generall a sufficient inference, that I meane of his Maiestie in particuler? What speach can be free from calumination, when such Sicophancy is vsed? Doth not euery man see the itching humour of adulation, discouered here vpon any least occasion? But let vs heare some reason of his. VVhat insolency (sayth he) is this,

Priests are subiect vnto temporall Princes, that are their Soueraignes: therefore also Popes. Is there no difference? And for that you name S.

               AMONG other points that were impugned out of Cardinall Bellarmines Letter, were certaine sentences, examples, and authorities of ancient Fathers, about the Oath. And first of all was the comparison of the subtill art, and deceipt (said I) vsed by Iulian the Emperour, surnamed the Apostata, and recounted by S. Gregorie Nazianzen, in placing, and inserting the Images of his false Gods, into the pictures of the Emperour, in his Imperiall banner, so as no man could bow downe, and do reuerence to the Emperours picture (as then was the custome) but that he must adore also the Images of the false Gods; which art of tem
                     •
                  erament

the Cardinall doth compare vnto this mixture, and combination of clauses, lawfull and vnlawfull; ciuill and ecclesiasticall, in the Oath proposed: so as, a man cannot sweare the one, but he must sweare also the other: for which cause, I said in my Letter, that the whole Oath with all the clauses, as it lyeth (in which sense, it hath bin also forbidden by his Holynes) cannot in any wise be taken, although touching some one only clause, not only cyuill, but also ecclesiasticall, as for example, of the Popes authority, of charity I might thinke (as then I wrote) that the Priests who tooke the Oath, tooke it in some such sense, as being explycated by them, and accepted of the Magistrate, might stand with the integrity of fayth. And that the sense of the sayd clause, might be agreed vpon, betwene his Maiesty and his subiects, in such sort as it should agree with the opinion, and practise of all other Catholicke Princes. But the whole Oath as it lyeth, is no other, then the picture of the Emperour, togeather with the Images of false Gods. Which similitude and comparison, though it expresse most fitly (as it seemeth) the matter in hand: yet was it impugned, by seeking out dissimilitudes, & disparities in other pointes, then wherein was made the sayd comparison. As for example, that first Iulian was an Apostata, but our Soueraigne is a Christian: Iulian changed the religion he once professed, but our King not: Iulian became an Ethnick, or Atheist, our King is not ashamed of his profession: Iulian dealt against Christians, his Maiesty dealeth only to make a distinction betweene true subiects, and false harted traytors &c. And so he goeth forward, alleadging many sundry diuersityes, betwene man and man, thing and things, state & states: which I said is nothing to our purpose. For a similitude requireth not likenes, or parity in all poyntes, for then it should be idem, and not simile, but liknes only in the point, wherin the comparison is made, as here in the compounding, and couching togeather of lawfull, and vnlawfull cl

stand vpon seeking out differences between the things that are compared, & other things wherein the comparison is not made, and thereby condemne the similitude, we shall ouerthrow all similitudes whatsoeuer, and particulerly we shall eneruate, & make voide all the Parables cōmonly of our Sauiour, wherin if we go from the point it self that is compared, we may find

                     lowes immodesty. You must imagine he is in some straits to answer the former discourse, but yet must needs set vpon it, well, or ill. Let vs se how he performeth it.
               
                  All the Censurers speach (sayth this Minister) commeth to this profound conclusion, that a similitude must only hould in that poynt, wherein it is compared, because that if the comparison should hould in all, it were pentity, and

not resemblance.
                  
Which doctrine of myne he seemeth to allow, and replieth not; but yet to seeme to say somewhat, and not syt out, he passeth to another discourse, that in foure manners comparisons m
                     •
                  y be made, eyther in the nature of the thing, or in the disposition, when some affection is resembled, or when a passion or perturbation is assimilated, or when the action only is compared without circumstances; which are obscure things without ground at all: and as well may foureteene poyntes of comparisons be found out as foure; to wit, so many as there may be differences betwene things that be compared; and therefore we recall M. Barlow from these idle euagations to the point it self.M. Barlow called from his idle vagaries. And for so much as he now graunteth, that things compared must not be like in all, but only in the point, wherein the comparison is made, how will he ouerturne Cardinall Bellarmines comparison, betwene the banner of Iulian, and the Oath of England.
               
               His point of comparison was this; that as Iulian did set forth in his banner, and combine togeather the images, as well of the Emperour, as of the false Gods, seeking to temper and mollify the one by the other; to wit, by bowing to, and honouring the Emperours image (which then was held for lawfull) to bow also, or seeme to bow at leastwise to the other, which was not lawfull: so in the Oath are combined togeather different clauses, some of temporall obedience, which are lawfull; some oth

or noe? If not, then are you from the purpose. But what say you now in this your last Reply after mature deliberation? You will not, I trust, fall to the same absurdity of seeking dissimilitudes, that are from the point of the comparison it self?

                     Barl. pag. 308.

               Thus far are the words of M. Barlow, who being well, (as you haue seene) towards the end, intangleth himself, and runneth quite from the purpose. He acknowledgeth in the beginning, that the comparison of Card. Bellarmine is only to shew the mixtures, as of the Images in the banner, the one lawfull, the other vnlawfull, so of the clauses in the Oath, the one lawfull, the other vnlawfull: but presently he steppeth aside, to put a difference betwixt the mixt adoration of the one, and the mixture of Allegiance in the other; wherin Card. Bellarmine made not his comparison,M. Barlowes shifting. no more then betwene the banner it selfe, and the Oath; or betweene the silke cloath wherein the pictures were painted, or the booke or paper wherin the Oath was written, or in any other such like differences, as might be pickt out, wherof this also is one, very impertinent to the matter, that the banner did tend to a mixt adoration, but not the Oath to a mixt allegiance, of which

mixt allegiance Card. Bellarmine neuer spake word, but only, that as the mixture of these Images was deuised to deceaue the Christians at that tyme; so the mixture of different clauses, some conteyning ciuill obedience, some ecclesiasticall disobedience, the one law
                     •
                  ull, the other vnlawfull, was deuised to intangle the consciences of the Catholikes. And so we see, that M. Barlow is forced to run to the same shift, that before he condēned, which is to seek out diuersities in points wherin no comparisō was made.
               The second example which is reprehended in Cardinall Bellarmines letter, is out of the second booke of Machabees, of old Eleazar that venerable man, who rather chose to die, then to do a thing vnlawfull, and against his owne conscience, or to seeme to doe it by dissimulation.
Which example the Cardinall applieth (said I) to the taking of this vnlawful Oath by such as are Catholikes,
                        Letter pag. 108. but especially by the Arch priest, Head of the Clergy in England, whose case he presumed to be more like to that of Eleazar, for his age, estimation, and authority aboue the rest.About the exāple of Eleazar. To which example the Apologer answereth thus. That if the Archpriests ground of refusing this Oath, were as good as Eleazars was for refusing to eate of the swines-flesh, that was proposed & vrged vnto him, it might not vnfitly be applyed to his purpose:
                        Apol. pag. 81. 
                     But the ground fayling (sayth he) the buylding cannot stand. But this is an escape much like the former, that runneth quite from the matter: for that the Cardinall supposeth a Catholike conscience in him to whom he writeth, to which conscience it is as repugnant to sweare any thing, sounding against any poynt of Catholike religion or doctrine, as it was to Eleazar to eate swines flesh
                        •
                      against the law of Moyses. Which supposition being made, and that in the Cardinals iudgment this Oath contayneth diuers clauses preiudiciall to some pointes of the said Catholike beliefe and doctrine, concerning the authority of the Sea Apostolicke, and that the taking therof would not only be hurtfull to the taker, but offensiue also and scandalous to many oth
                        •
                     r of that religion, both at home and abroad, the application of this example

of Eleazar was most fit, & effectuall.
               
               This was answered at that tyme. Now M. Barlow commeth with new deuises. First he calleth this example aprochryphall, for that it is taken out of the second booke of Machabees: but Catholicks do hould it for Canonicall; and so do the ancient Fathers: and so was it declared by a holy Councell, aboue 1200. yeares agoe, wherein S. Augustine himself sate as one of the Iudges. But whether it were or no; that maketh nothing to our present purpose, but only whether the example be well applied or no.
               Secondly, that eating of swines-flesh refused by Eleazar was forbidden by the law of God, but this swearing (saith he) is warranted by Scripture. Wherto I answere, that swearing in it owne nature, and with due circumstances of truth, iudgment, and iustice is warranted,
                     Hier. 4. when true and iust things are sworne; but euery Oath in particuler is not warranted by Scripture; and namely if it containe any thing, that eyther in it self, or in the swearers iudgment, and conscience is not true, or lawfull. And such is this Oath to Catholiks in both respectes, and therefore not warranted, but condemned by Scripture.
               Thirdly he sayth, when I am at a stand, and can go no further, I do wind my self out, by rūning to the common place of conscience, and Catholike religion. But what sayth he, if there be a false assumption, and an vntrue applycation by the conscience, is it then erroneous, and not binding? As put the case, the conscience assumeth that to be sound and Catholike, which is false and vnchristian doctrine.An erroneous cō
                     science bindeth. To this question I haue answered now sufficiently before, and haue largly proued, that an erroneous conscience also byndeth vntill it be reformed; and that it is impiety, and ignorance to teach the contrary: nor shall it be needfull to repeat all the reasons and arguments here. This one may stand insteed of all the rest, which is the ground of all, That if a man may without sinne do against the dictamen or direction of his owne conscience, then may he do that which he thinketh to be naught, and consequently do naught, wittingly and willingly

without sin, which is against the groundes both of Diuinity, Philosophy, and Nature it self. And yet M. Barlow is so wise, as to affirme here, that an erroneous conscience byndeth not.
