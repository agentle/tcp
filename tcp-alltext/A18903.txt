            Of whom, his Maiestie in perſon hath had the view, and, (by his commaund) his beſt and chiefest Phiſitians, haue tryed all meanes, to find, whether this fast & abstinence be by deceit or no.
            In this Hiſtorie is alſo diſcourſed, whether a man may liue many dayes, moneths or yeeres, without receiuing any ſuſtenance.

            ¶ A true and meruailous Hiſtorie, of a Maiden of Poictou, who for the ſpace of three yeeres and more, hath liued without either meate or drinke.
            
               
                  EVripides deſired, that either wee might line as dumbe, in perpetuall ſilence: or that dumbe thinges, vvithout any ambiguitie of words, might ſpeake to vs. As for my ſelfe, I could wiſh, that either we were of thoſe Indian people called Astomi, whom Plinie
               Lib. 7. cap. 1. deſcribeth to liue without mouthes: or elſe contented (like them) with the ſole benefit of ayre, without eating or drinking, wee might heere ſpend our time. For by this meanes it might come to paſſe, that our ſpirit, (which with a firme eye cannot cō
               template things naturall, no more then the Owle looke on the rayes of of the Sun) beeing freed from thoſe

miſtes & thicke vapours, occaſioned by the vſe of meats: would comprehend with a perfect regard, the Ideas and formes of things nakedlie, and according as they are indeede▪

               Chriſippus then ſhould not neede, to take Helleborus with ſuch obſeruāce, for the purging of his vnderſtanding, to the end he might the more ſubtilly ſee, the ſtrength of his arguments. Our ſoule (againſt her nature) would be no heauie burden at all vnto vs: ſhee ſhould not neede to ſerue herſelfe with the ſalt of our bodies, to keepe her from corrupting▪ but rather ſhee would be like vnto a Phar
                     •
                  s, which in our diuine nauigation, would diſcouer the way for our attayning to the land of heauen.
            But in regard that our life is maintained, by the nouriſhing of the bodie, and that by (one mutuall aſsiſtance) both together doe conſerue thēſelues, euen while we our ſelues

doe ſtudie how to ſupport this life, by continuall care for furniſhing it with 
                  •
               oodes: it enſueth, that wee altogether abaſe, & caſt downe to the earth, that part of the ſoule, which otherwiſe (of her ſelfe) would couet nothing els, then to eleuate her ſelfe to high and heauenly things. Notwithſtanding, Plato holdeth, thatIn his Timeus. man is pouruayed of ſtore of repletion, and cloying for the inteſtines, to ſhewe, that God hath created him a ſoule full of reaſon & councell: with out which, as the plants are euermore faſtened to their rootes, for their feeding, ſo would hee likewiſe alwaies haue meate in his mouth, or elſe, as the beaſts, his minde would be perpetually labouring, in ſeeking after nothing but freſh paſture. You may ſee the ſame thus, while the meate dooth conuay it ſelfe by the paſſages of the belli
                  •
               , the ſpirit naturally ſends his ſtrength vegetatiue &

nutritiue thorow the bodie, and by this commixture, life, & the motion of the bodie is maintained: and as this more ſublime part of nature, paſſeth on further ſtill to ſhewe the effects of his force and vertue, ſo after foode hath ſuſtained the bodie, the ſpirit is called too the deſire of new viandes, & conſtrainde to yeeld it ſelfe ſubject to the bellies appetite▪
               Lib. 26. cap. 8. For there is nothing (ſaith Plinie) that is more painefull to a man, then his bellie, for the content whereof, the moſt part of men imploy their whole life time. This importuning veſſell of the bodie, euermore is at hand with vs, like a greedie creditour ſummoning vs many times in the day: but he is not to be liſtened to alwayes when he calls, if hee haue had his dutie paide him. No more then one vnder age, who would not allow his tutour or guardian the expences for his nouriſhing, as though

he had liued with him onlie vppon winde, and yet continually hath binTit. De alim. pup. praeſt. C. by him, and fed with his purſſe: but whoſoeuer ſhall or doth deale ſo, the Emperour hath iudged him not receiueable, except he can proue he hath had his feeding elſwhere.
            The neceſsitie of the bellie, is alwayes in ſuch rigour with vs, that the Stoicks themſelues, who were excluded (in themſelues) from all ſenſe of man, conſtrainedly did yet liſten to the bellies murmuring: and did eate, but how? to the end they might ſhunne eating. Quite contrarie to certaine gourmandes and gluttons, who vſed then, and yet doe, to eate and drinke, only to encreaſe their eating and drinking: hauing no other God but their bellie, wheron they beſtowe whatſoeuer ſerues to excite luxurie: for which, the Seas are trauerſed, euen ſo farre as to the Riuer Phaſis, ranſacking her entrailes,

for contentation agreeing with their inſatiable appetites. And this is that part, wherein we come neereſt vnto brute beaſtes, who by their proper nature, are led to deſire whatſoeuer their bellie demaundes, and (with whom) we make cōmon this neceſsitie, of eating and drinking.
            For nature hath giuen to all creatures one inſtrument of life, which is naturall heate, & that (euen as our wood in the fire) hath his ſeate in the triple ſubſtaunce of our bodie, to 
                  •
               it, the ſolide, humorall and ſpirituous parts, which (without ceaſsing) he ruinates and conſumeth: ſo that in very ſmall while, all would bee waſted, if it were not maintained by a freſh ſupply of meates and drinkes, neither more or leſſe, then as the flame of a Lampe, which is extinct ſo ſoone as the Oyle is conſumed, if no more be put thereinto for longer

laſting: And heereupon, Hippocrates
               Lib. 1. Aph. 14. the Prince of Phiſitians ſayd, that the bodies of young men haue neede of more nouriſhment, then others, becauſe they haue much more heate then they: for otherwiſe (ſaith hee) their bodies would conſume themſelues. Contrariwiſe, the bodies of olde men, becauſe they haue but little ſtore of heate, they haue neede but of as little nouriſhing.
            
               Aph. 13. Hence may we draw a confirmed atgument, by this which Hippocrates himſelfe hath ſaid, that old men eaſilie endure faſting, but next thē, ſuch as are in the ſtrength of theyr age, yet leſſe then young men, & infants leaſt of all other, but eſpecially ſuch as are liuelieſt, and readieſt in theyr bodily functions. For the littlenes of heate, the tenacitie of the primitiue humour, and the denſitie or thicknes of the body, impeacheth old
                  •
                men, that this triple ſubſtance canno
                  •
               
               
waſt it ſelfe at all: whence proceedeth, that they haue nothing at all ſuch neede of meates, and the deſire or appetite after thē (if ſo I may ſay) which is hunger, in them is much languiſhing. As cōtrariwiſe in young men, it is ſo much the more ardent, as the heat naturall is aboundant, the 
                  〈◊〉
                more fluxible, and the compoſition of the body more thin, and leſſe heaped together. VVhich three things, as they cauſe the foode receiued to conſume, ſo by little and little, they repaire any defect there ariſing. For as it ſhould be thus, that the ſubſtance of euery creature, diſſolues it ſelfe by the pores of the skin, into the ayre which enuirons it1. De ſym
                  
                     •
                  om. cauſ. 7. (ſaith Galen) ſo followes it of neceſſitie, that the very neereſt parts of the skin, ſhould be firſt deſtitute of nouriture, that by their propper ſtrength & vertue, they might draw the nouriſhment from the other

neighbouring parts, onely to repaire that, which through default of ſuſtentation is become worſt: thoſe there, from the veines, theſe heere, from the liuer: the liuer frō the inteſtines & ventricle (by the meſenterie veines) calling what is moſt familiar, and conuenable to his nature. Then the ventricle, ſeeing her ſelfe emptie, by a naturall vnderſtanding which ſhe hath, of that which is wanting to her: ſhee is incited to deſire meate, wherwith ſhe may be ſuſtained.
            But if ſome body be preſented, which hath but ſmall ſtore of heate, and much more naturall moyſture, whereto the pores and reſpiracles of of the skin doe giue place; there is no great euacuation made of this triple ſubſtance, and ſo conſequentlie, there is no neede at all of much nouriſhment. Neither is it altogether neceſſarie (as Galen witneſſeth)

And this he giues vs to vnderſtand, by the example of ſaluage beaſtes, which (all winter together) will not leaue their dennes and cauernes, and hereupon he calles them Phooleuonta Zooa, ſuch as are Beares, Battes, or

All which hauing at ſpring time (by warmth & heate) the conuoyes of their bodie releaſed and opened, when they knowe that inwarde warmth reſolues them, & makes them to waxe hungrie; they come foorth (by their owne proper motion) out of their priſons, and (guided by nature only) ſeeke in all parts, the feeding which

is apteſt for them. Hence hee gathereth, that continuall breathing, which is occaſioned by reſpiration, procures this defect, & this alſo prouokes the appetite and deſire of eatting. For nature hath giuen this propertie to the emptie part, which thus requireth to be filled. So that if the cauſe ceaſſed, for which the body hath need of nouriture, it would enſue as neceſſarilie, that the ſelfe ſame penurie, and his vnderſtanding, which is hunger, by little and little would decay: and therefore by this reaſon, the creatures which are ſo hidden in the caues of the earth, may liue without the vſe of foode.S. Auguſt. lib. 21. deciuit. Chap. 6▪
                So likewiſe, by the report of notable men, and wel worthie credence, that in the Lanternes and hollowe places of olde Sepulchers, burning Lampes haue bin found, which the inſcriptions on the ſaid Tombes haue witneſſed, that they were put

in there, almoſt infinite yeares before their finding: as that whereof Lodouicus Viues ſpeaketh, diſcouered about the yeare 1500. which Hermolaus Barbarus ſaith, was found in the territories of Pauia, without date of day, or of Conſull in very deed, but yet notwithſtanding, it had bin there incloſed aboue eight hundred yeares before, as by the written diſcourſe P. Appianus gathered. Such Lampes then, were preſerued ſo long a time with little maintenance, becauſe the moiſture there doth ſtrongly ſupport them, and they periſh but little: whether it be by the humiditie (which the Alchymiſtes tearme radicall) of the gold (which alone among all naturall bodies, is belieued, to ſuffer no diminution at all of his ſubſtance) or any other thing therto belonging, but ſo it appeares by the teſtification, engrauen vppon a veſſell of earth, which Barbarus

Since which time, coulde not any one perſwade this Mayden (in any manner) to eate, albeit they made trial, to haue her but ſuck or lick meats delicate, fruits, and ſweet things, agreeable to ſuch yo

ſhe goes with ſome difficultie. One onely impotencie remaineth to her, that ſhe cannot ſwallow or let down any thing, for ſhe altogether loathes and abhors mightily, both meates & drinks.
            In this time (a thing moſt ſtrange) the inferiour part of the belly, by little & little is in ſuch maner grown leane, and dried vp in her, as downe from her ſides, and ſo along to her nauill, there remaineth nothing of the belly which ſhee had before.

readie: her head couered with haire of good length, for her nailes and haire, they do encreaſe, in each meet part of the body. There comes not any excrement from her, her belly yeelds no ordure, neither doth any vrine at all paſſe from her bladder, or is the matrixe impeached by her menſtruall flowers. Her head is not charged with filth or dandriffe, but ſhewes it ſelfe verie ſound and well, as well in the exteriour part of the

            The whole body ouer, yeelds no ſweat at all, but we, and ſuch as haue touched her, doe find all her skinne to be colde and dry, and not heated or chafed by any moouing, (except the arme-pits, & thoſe parts which

neighbor neer to the hart) yet doth ſhee trauaile about the houſe, goe to the market for victuals; ſweepe the houſe; ſpinne at her wheele; reele off her quill; and giues herſelfe (as any other) to all ſeruiceable offices in a familie, & ſeemes as if ſhee were not defectiue, in any part of ſence, or mouing of her bodie.
            By all which things, we may gather the raritie, and meruailous noueltie of this example: for the accident happeneth in ſuch an age, whē as the body receiues increaſing. And thoſe things which increaſe, haue need of good ſtore of nouriture▪ but eſpecially in bodies of ſuch conſtitution, as this Maidens is, ſlender, thin, & cold, where the internall parts are accuſtomed to be moſt hot. Hence comes it, that our auncients haue ſaid, that in VVinter our bellies areLib. 1. Aph. 15. more hot, then at other times, which cauſeth a much readier concoction,

and an appetite leſſe tollerable, eſpecially when it is prouoked by exerciſes: whereof this Mayden maketh no ſpare, eſpecially, ſuch as her age is capable of, the ayre and ſoyle alſo wherein ſhe liues, affoords the people to be very hungry. All which occaſions of appetite and hunger, were taken frō her by the accident of her continuall Feauer: and in the end, all her naturall functions became aſſwaged, and ſeazed on by a kinde of dead Palſie.
            And nowe to begin with the firſt & principall, the little belly or maw, (which otherwiſe is the receptacle of foode, and the officer for the firſt concoction) being lagde & rent by the ordure of crude & raw humors, hath languiſhed in ſuch ſort, as it had no power, either to retaine the meates therin encloſed, or to receiue in any other. Euen ſo in Hippocrates, Hermocrates being ſurprized with an

extreame burning Feauer, did euermore caſt the foode hee receiued: becauſe this facultie had loſt his ſtrength, and that was quenched in him (ſaith Galen in the ſame place)Com. 1. whereof the office was, to feele lack in health, and to deſire what was familiar for him.
            Many would attribute the cauſe of this Symptome, or paſsion enſuing ſickneſſe, to ſome bad power in an Apple, which an olde woman had giuen to this young Maiden, two or three months before; becauſe when ſhe had eaten it, ſhe had a diſtaſte of her meats, and felt ſome alteration of her ſpirits. But in regard, that (beſides this) nothing hath happened to her, which outwardly hath impeached her health, neither her naturall functions, vntill ſhe became ſurprized by the Feauer before mentioned; I ſee no reaſon at all, that yeelds any ſubiect to belieue, how

the euill power in the Apple, could remaine ſo long time hidden, without yeelding any effect. Her vomiting ceaſsing, ſhe became dumbe, by reaſon of thoſe nerues reſolution, which wee call recurrent (vvhich hapned to her ſoone after through all her body) the fleame cold & raw, beeing liquefied by the heate of the Feauer, which by this meanes wrought a debilitie in the braine, cauſed that ſhee could not be ſound and wel in ſpirit. Here-hence it hath neceſſarily followed, that ſhe muſt needs looſe the ſence of taſt & ſucking, and likewiſe the vſe of ſwallowing meat and drinke: which onely hath procured the abolition of the animall appetite, and by little & little, it hath bin followed, by a totall priuation of the appetite naturall, which Hippocrates noteth by theſe words, Genestai de ouc edunato, if we may giue credit to his moſt graue

interpreter Galen. VVhich caſts the cauſe of this paſsion, vpon the blame of the liuer, who being the vegetant and naturall ſoule, ſo ſoone as ſhe is wounded, ſhe is conſtraind, that the auxiliarie, or ſuccouring faculties, (to wit, attraction, retention, aſsimiliation or compariſon, and expulſion, in whom lies all the power of nouriſhing) muſt needs ſinck & fall, and ſo conſequently the appetite, which cannot be compleat & perfect, but by attraction. The ſame Authour gathers it to be the ſicknes of the liuer in Hermocrates, by this,1. Epid. ſect. 3. that the ſixt day of his ſickneſſe, he was ſeene to looke yellow: & notwithſtanding, in all the courſe of his diſeaſe, which was for 27. dayes, this yellownes neuer left him (as it had done in Heraclides, to whō the ſelfe ſame paſsion happened, and on the ſame day) neither by ſweating, neither by the voyding of much choller;

nor by the conuoye of the bellie; nor by vrine, nor yet by vomitting. And therefore it was eaſie to be ſeene, that the naturall facultic (whereof the liuer is the fountaine) in very ſtrange manner was ouerthrowne. VVhich being ſo, all the5. De lo

For it is recorded of the Scithians, that if by any occaſion happening them, they are to endure long faſting: they will binde vp their bellies ſtrictly with large bands, to the ende, that hunger may not charge them ſo ſoone, becauſe they haue left little or no ſpace at all for the bellies conuoye.

bin often relieued with ſome foode, albeit not ſolide, whereby theſe excrements (by a ſecret ſtrength in nature) were ſent into their proper organes.

               Plinie aſſures vs, that drought or thirſt may be ſurmounted, by a conſtant perſeuerance, and that the Romaine noble Knight Iulius Viator, hauing had warning by Phiſitians in his younger yeares, not to drinke any water at all, by reaſon of a certaine

indiſpoſition in him, leaning to the dropſie: he turned the cuſtome of nature in ſuch ſort, as he paſſed his age without drinking. Freſh yet in our memory, and all Fraunce hath ſeene the ſame, in the perſon of my Lord Marqueſſe of Piſani: who is a man of ſuch merit, as the King himſelfe imployes his ſeruice, in matters of great importaunce. There are many bookes of deuoute enſtructions, which doo recounte meruailes, of diuers frequent and voluntarie abſtinences, as of P. Alcantara, a Monke in Spayne, and that for eight dayes and more in euerie moneth. But beyond all others, there is an hiſtorie very famous, of a certaine Maiden named Catharine, being in the ſoyle of Colherberg, who hath bin knowne to liue ſeauen yeares together, without drinking, or eating any thing whatſoeuer. She was carefully tended by Henry Smetius, at this preſent

The 24. of Nouember 1584. by the commandement of Iohn Caſimir, Counte Palatine, and ſince alſo to the ſame effect, foure Matrones were appointed to keepe her companie, as well by night as by day, who with the Phiſitians, haue alſo acknowledged, this abſtinence to be moſt true. Three yeares after, this hiſtorie was traduced into French, & Printed at Francford by Iohn VVechel, in the yeare 1587. with an aduertiſement in the end, that the Maiden as yet then liued in that manner, without drinking, eating, ſleeping, or deliuering any excrements.
            Beſides all theſe, Ioubert (concerning this argument) hath ſet downe ſuch pregnant & neceſſary reaſons, as I cannot thinke, that any one needs to make doubt thereof. Neuertheleſſe, being my ſelfe afterward

to diſcourſe on the ſame ſubiect, I happened (being in a Booke-ſellers ſhop) letting mine eyes wander ouer the bookes, to be preſented at my very entrance with a litle book, bearing in the fore-head this title: Fieri non poſſe, vt quis ſine cibo et pot
                     •
                   plures dies et annos tranſigat. At the ſame inſtant I tooke, the Booke, which (in regard it was written by I. Haruet a Doctour of Phiſick, and of the ſame condition with vs, and as we are) I read it very ſeriouſlie frō one end to the other. But comming to the place, where he argues on the negligence, of the Authours of ſoPag. 74▪
                many notable examples, who (he ſaith) haue bin ſomewhat deceiued, by the inueterate beleefe of this extraordinarie faſting: I thought it good, that he ſhould be ſatisfied in this poynt, and paſſed my promiſe thereon, in the name of our Maide of Confolans; albeit, during ſo many

moneths, & yeares, I could not giue my ſelfe to conſider all het actions and motions; neuertheleſſe it is very likelie, by that which is ſayd in all places of her, concerning the three yeares faſt now in queſtion. And yet ſuch as haue ſeene her naked, as vve haue done, haue thought no otherwiſe, if ſhe be not changed ſince the laſt time I ſaw her, which was in the month of Iuly laſt, 1602. Some ſay, that ſhe is now a little more full of fleſh, & yet ſhe hath neuer receiued any foode at all, that could poſsibly be knowne. Beſide, this truth ought to receiue credit generally, by the faithfull report of ſo many perſons of honour, and good qualitie, who (for trials ſake) haue kept her in their houſes, among their Maides & children, ſome for three, others for foure months and more. If any one be further deſirous, and would willingly ſee her, hee hath free libertie,

& the Maiden herſelfe will not contradict, what other proofes, hee or any can make of her. But in my mind, Ioubert would haue receiued no meane contentment, by the ſight of an accident ſo ſtrange: for, if to ſo many pertinent reaſons, hee could haue had but an eye-experience, he ſhould not haue had now (perhaps) Haruet for his aduerſarie. VVho being in the humor, to combat againſt both ſence and reaſon, it may be, it would then be the harder for him, to vndergoe the demonſtrations of Ioubert: for they are vnderpropped with principles ſoundly aſſured, and drawn from the oracles, euen of the great Dictatour of Nature.

Thus dooth he hold, that all things are made by heat, and that all functions are performed thereby.

               Galen is alſo of the ſame oppinion, and ſaith, that heat is either the ſubſtance of the faculties, or at leaſt, the chiefe, and moſt neceſſarie inſtrument of them. It is no maruell then, if Haruet thinks it to be ſtrange, that Ioubert ſaith according to Aristotle, that life dependeth vpon heat only.

For, that it muſt needes be ſo, life is nothing els, but an abiding or attendance of the ſoule with the heat, according to the ſame Aristotles iudgment:Lib. de reſp. and we cannot in this obſcuritie of things, find any more aſſured inſtance of this preſent life, then by the functions thereof, of all vvhich, heat (as the eſpeciall inſtrument, and without other meanes) is the authour, the cauſe motiue and effecter. And Ioubert (to no ſmall purpoſe) hath defined life by heat, in that Ariſtotle hath conſigned death, by the extinctiō of the ſame heat: for Ioubert groundeth on this axiome, that of two contraries, the conſequents are contraries. And Galen himſelfe,1. De ſan. tu. (who holdeth death to arriue then, when heat being weakned and broken by frequent action, becomes faint, and that the temper of the elementary qualities which are in vs, being out of ſquare, comes to yeeld

it ſelfe vnder the tirannie of one alone) giues therby reaſonably to vnderſtand, that the courſe of life keeps it ſelfe for ſo long time, as naturall heat dooth aboundantly diſperſe it ſelfe with the radicall humour, and that the elementarie qualities doe hold a good ſimpathie among them ſelues, in their harmony & kind accord, which wee call temperature. And therefore it is blameleſſe, to define life by theſe two cauſes, that is to ſay, heat and temperature, becauſe it behooueth to take the definition, by the cauſe which is moſt neere. Now heat is the moſt neere inſtrument of the ſoule, the temper (next that) of naturall heat, which diſpoſeth, and accommodates it to diuers actions. Then this cauſall definition is well deriued, from the chiefe and principall occaſion of life, which heere wee haue alleaged by the authoritic of Ariſtotle.
            
            
               
Neuertheleſſe, Haruet goes after another faſhion, he defines the life of man, to be an action of the reaſonable ſoule, produced into the bodie of man: but this definition is not ſubtile enough. For firſt & formoſt, life is no action at all of the ſoule, otherwiſe, it ſhould be the ſoule that liueth, and not the body: but life is an abiding (as hath bin ſaid) or an vnion of the ſoule with the body (according as Ariſtotle deſcribeth in another of his bookes) wherof (ſoone8. Metaph. after) proceedeth action.
            Heere I add, that the actions of life, beeing, to vnderſtand, to ſmell, to mooue, and to nouriſh: if life be an action, then it were an action of an action, which is moſt abſurd. Or els, if life be an action of the reaſonable ſoule, in ſo much then as ſhee is reaſonable, the corporal parts ſhould then be driuen to performe they
                  •
                operations (as receiuing foode for

nouriſhment, to beget her like) onely by reaſon and the intellect, & not by any naturall ſence. But peraduenture, Haruet hauing drawn his definition from others, hath read, that life is an act of the reaſonable ſoule, which word of act, he hath conuerted into action. Or, act is that which the Greeks call E
                     •
                  telecheia, which is a perfection, efficacie, and moouing power of it ſelfe: far enough differing from that which they call Ergon. And ſo one may (to ſome purpoſe) define life, an act of the ſoule in the body, that is to ſay, a power & vertue of the ſoule, by the vnion thereof with the body▪ VVhence is caſie to be vnderſtood, that taking life generally, it ſhould rather be imputed to naturall heat, as to the organe of the ſoule, then vnto reaſon: in caſe notwithſtanding, that this heat ſtill abides alwaies vnited with the radicall moiſture, which although

that day by day it be conſumed by this heate, yet neuertheleſſe, nature prouideth a ſubrogation daily of new, which ſhe borrows from the nouritures we receiue, as it hath bin ſaid already heeretofore. But Haruet imagineth, that theſe nouriſhments ſerue yet to another vſe, which is (ſaith he) to relieue & fortifie the ſpirits; the which I
                     •
                  ubert hath omitted: as if vnder this name of radicall moiſture, we ſhould comprehend onely moiſture by it ſelfe, & not the ſpirits likewiſe. And what is he, who will denie, that the ſpirits are not reſtored & ſtrengthened, both by eating and drinking? Yee haue (in very truth) great ſtore of things, heere chawed, and eaten vnprofitably, and to little purpoſe. And of abounding, that vvhich he propoſeth againſt Hippocrates, in the 14. Aphoriſme of his 2. Booke, is altogether paradoxicall, to wit,

that hee in whom heate is moſt languiſhing, hath the more neede of nouriſhment: which hee proues by the example of a forty-yeeres aged man, who (ſaith he) receiueth more food then any infant of two or three dayes, in whom notwithſtanding, there is an aduantage of this heat, according to Hippocrates himſelfe.
            Behold, in my iudgement, an argument very feeble, if one ſhould bring in all that he failes in, & if alſo we ſhould oppoſe the organs of the twaine, the one againſt the other. For, to the end that vnder this word Infant, no cauillation may be couered, I call all them Infants, which are vnder 14. yeeres of age, in the ſame maner as the Greekes do vnderſtand this word Paidi
                     •
                  . They, I ſay, that according to the proportion of their maw or little belly, doe take more foode, then men of middle & perfect age: as well by reaſon of the power

of the facultie, which ſeethes or boiles the foode (whence proceedeth a ſpeedie riddance thereof,) as by their frequent exerciſes, during the which time, good ſtore of their ſubſtance glides it ſelfe thorow the pores into the skinne: to the end I may be ſilent alſo, in the two neceſſities alleaged by Hippocrates, that infants haue of eating, to wit, for nouriſhing, & to giue encreaſing to the bodie.
            Now the ſtrength of the facultie, which boiles the meate in our ſtomack, depends much vppon temperature and moderation, but that is, when it is excited and prouoked on by the heat natural, which although that after one food is digeſted, ſhee introduceth not then of herſelfe any other nouriture, as ſaith Haruet: neuertheleſſe; becauſe that this firſt is thus digeſted by heate, there growes incontinently a feeling of

penurie and want of foode, at the mouth of the ventricle, which we call hunger. For this cauſe, Ioubert referres only to heate (as the principall agent) the quantitie of thoſe foodes, which we take immediatly after, and they are ruled by the appetite of hunger. The facilitie of ſupportingCom. 2. Apho. 13. hunger (ſaith Galen) makes it ſelfe knowne thus; when any one hath no appetite at all, and yet neuertheleſſe he feeles no endamagement or defect. VVhich Haruet thus brings in, that ſuch as are reſtored from ſickneſſe, haue a good appetite, and yet notwithſtanding, no ſuch meates are then giuen them, as their appetite doth deſire: but when aduiſe is giuen for reſtoring of the powers, it beho
                  •
               es alſo to haue regard to the 
                  〈…〉
                of the naturall heate, 
                  〈…〉
                is not to be any way iniuried, but ſtill ſupported. This is thus done, becauſe that the temperature

beeing not yet thorowlie reſeated, & the naturall faculties feele themſelues as yet to be diſeaſed: the organes cannot boile the foodes receiued, in too great a quantity. Now Ioubert in his demonſtration, purpoſed to ſpeake of the healthfull▪ not of the ſick, or elſe of them which are neither. And therefore he concluds, that olde men haue not need of meate often, becauſe they doo not deſire or appetite often, principally conſidering, that they haue colde bodies: whereto Haruet in no wiſe will agree, for he ſaith, that all the action of mixed bodies, comes from the qualitie; which winnes the vpper hand in the aſſembling of the elements. So is it in liuing bodies, heate ruleth ouer the other qualities, of which heate, all action hath his originall, and not of colde. I willingly admit the propoſition with Aristotle, ſo farre foorth as to mixte

things, inanimate or without ſoule, & which know the ſimple formes of the elements, for their principles. But in animate bodies, hauing ſoules, & which haue a forme more noble, wherein are contained thoſe other more ignoble (euen as the triangle within the quadrangle) this is not a thing ſo eaſie. For they acknowledge (as the principall of their functions) that nature, properlie called the ſoule I ſay, that is, the moouing vertue of the naturall bodie, the organe, liuing by power.
            And as for that which Haruet placeth in aſſumption of his argument, that in the liuing bodie, heate doth ſurmount the other elementarie qualities: I cannot allow therof, except he wil haue this heate to be vnderſtood, to be the ſame which diffuſeth it ſelfe through the bodie, gouerneth and moderateth the whole Oeconomie of ſame. And

this, while it is in eſſence, maintaineth life, but comming once to quench it ſelfe, then death of neceſſitie muſt follow: and this ſurmounteth & ſubiecteth to it ſelfe, not only the colde, moiſt and drie elementarie qualities, but euen the hote elementarie nature alſo, beeing (as in herſelfe) truelie celeſtiall. For, if he would haue to be vnderſtood, this heate predominated by the elementarie heate, as it ſeemeth to enſue by his ſillogiſme▪ then let me ſet the Salamander before him, which (in his mixtion) is compoſed of a temperature ſo colde, as his very touch doth no leſſe extinguiſh the fire, then as if it were yce. Hee liues notwithſtanding, yet not by the heate mixed or elementarie, which being weake in it ſelfe, cannot ſurmount the power of this colde: it followes then, that it muſt needes be by the heate celeſtiall, which likewiſe maintaineth life

in Serpents, whom euery one knowes to bee colde temperatelie▪ This then which hath bin ſaid, that the colde in olde men, makes them to hate the abounding of foode, it muſt bee, that Haruet meanes it in ſuch ſort, that cold hath no dominion ouer humaine bodies, becauſe actually it can haue no part thereof. But for the colde of Hippocrates, it isCom. 1. Apho. 14. the ſame, which Galen, and all Phiſitians (by compariſon) doo call a ſoft heat, and therefore their weake and little heate, hath neede of ſome ſmall help: euen as the ſlender flame of a Lampe, is maintained by putting in the oyle by little & little, but eaſilie is it extinguiſhed, in beeing ſmoothered by a ſuperaboundant effuſion.
            Hetherto we haue ſpoken of naturall heate, as beeing the primitiue agent: wherein we haue defended for M▪ 
               Ioubert, that according to the

abounding or tenuitie thereof, the bodie hath neede of much or little nouriſhment. Now let vs ſpeake of the primitiue humour pacient, and of his nature, and how it is ſubiected to this heate.
            VVith the conſent of all Phiſitians, we haue conſtituted heat to be the firſt eſſentiall cauſe of our life, & haue ſaid, that ſhe, of herſelfe, cannot produce any effect of her functions, without a proper nouriſhment, which is the radicall moiſture, & the primitiue abounding, mingled with heate in the ſeede and menſtruall blood, the principles of our generation. But by the ſwift flight of yeres, i
                  •
                greatly deminiſheth and decayeth it ſelfe, to our harme, by the continuall embracing of the heate: for the ſlacking or delaying whereof, as we doo warilie renew the oyle in the burning Lampe, euen ſo doo we as dilligently giue feeding to this

heat, feeding, I ſay, which ſerues to reſtore this humiditie, and deliuer it from ſo ſtrict an embracing. So that if in the body, there be any ſuperabounding humour, which theſe parts cannot any way diſperſe, Galen calls the ſame, Peritton hupoleipomenon.
               In lib▪ 5. Apho. 39. And in Schooles, it is termed an vnprofitable excrement, as it, which remaines (ſaith he) within little hollow places of the bones, and (as the humiditie fumes vp to the lungs or lites, the moiſture glues the ioynts, the ſeed is in the ſecrets and pipes, wherby it is voided foorth, ſpettle is in the tongue, & milke in the breſts) ſo this keepes the place for food, and ſerueth the fomentation & blowing vp of the natural heat, as Ioubert hath very amply written in his Paradoxe, and we our ſelues haue heeretofore declared. Therefore, ſo much as remaineth of this humour in the body, & while it there remaineth, there

is no neede at all of drinking nor eating, and yet notwithſtanding, it is in the meane time nouriſhed, & liueth: which Haruet denieth with the like obſtinacie, and reiecteth all the reaſons of this demonſtration. But for our own credit and regard, & without troubling our ſelues, to cull out his writings by parcels, where hee himſelfe both makes & feigneth obiections, whereto alſo he anſwereth, as any newe Apprentiſe in Phiſicke might do the like: we will confute thoſe reaſons, which ſeem to be beſt furniſhed with apparence, albeit we cannot endure any errour, how little ſo euer it be.
            
               Page, 47. In the beginning of this propoſition, hee impoſeth on Ioubert, who hath writtē, that not only the ſmaleſt heat helpeth to make abſtinence or faſting the more eaſie, but alſo, that the humour ſuperfluous, and which holds the place of naturall heate,

might the more abound. This doth Haruet interpret in his ſence, as if Ioubert had ſaid, that the ſole ſmalleſt heat, not only helps to render abſtinence the more eaſie, but alſo to the end, that the humour ſuperfluous, & which holds the place of naturall heat, might be the more aboundant. From whence hee drawes the propoſition following; That the ſmalleſt heat cauſeth the abounding of the ſuperfluous humour: againſt which propoſition hee ſo tires his ſpirit, and torments himſelfe, euen as if it were vpon Ioubert. Let the Reader ſee, if hee haue propoſed apparance, or no.
            Now he makes it a great caſe, andPage▪ 52. thinks he hath enterpriſed an act beſeeming an other Hercules, to ſhew, that the excrement ſomtimes holds the place of foode, and that nature ſerues herſelfe in the ſame vſage or manner, and that it can repaire that,

which is impaired by the power of heat. In truth, the excrements doe not fall altogether vnder one & the ſame conſideration. For there be ſome which are quite againſt nature, and wholy vnprofitable, and which haue no reſemblance at all with vs, and therefore can neuer turne them ſelues to our vſe, to be incorporated with vs. The Greeks call them by an apt name, Perittoomata, as the ordure, vrine, ſweat, &c.
            There be others more according to nature, which are profitable to ſome part of the body: & yet are excrements, not in regard of all, or the whole body, but for ſome part therof only. Euen ſo the Chylus or white iuyce, (comming of the meat digeſted in the ſtomack, whereof blood is ingendred) after that the ventricle is full, it is ſent to the inteſtines, as an excrement and vnprofitable charge. VVhen it is drawn by the liuer, then

that which was an excrement of the ventricle, is now made a nouriſhmēt to the liuer. Now there, while of the Chylus or white iuyce blood is made, the ſpleene, and the bladder of the gall or choller, doe draw from both the one & the other, gall (which are the excrements of the liuer) theyr familiar nouriture: and hauing taken their conuenable portion, they ſend away the reſt as an excrement, which can doe no more ſeruice, nor giue contentment to any one part. The ſpleene ſends that which ſhee holds ſuperfluouſly, by a little veſſell at the bottome of the ventricle, and ſometimes by the hemorrhoides, & from thence to the inteſtines. The veſſell of the gall or choller, by the Parancholidocum, to Duodenum or Inteſtinum primum, and other parts.
            By the which demonſtration, Galen

                  . would induce, that all theſe two parts of blood, (to wit, the thick and

earthy, which the ſpleene draweth, and the moſt ſubtile of all, drawn by the bladder of the gall or choller, which hauing paſt by the examen of the heat, conuerts it ſelfe into choller) are according to nature, & ſerue her to ſome vſe, becauſe that theyr proper veſſels were ordained, for thē to be receiued into. But as concerning the diuers kinds of choller, and all the ſorts of ſeroſites, becauſe that they are things vnprofitable, & out of nature, there hath not beene any veſſell allowed to them, Onely to phlegme, rheume, or ſpettle, nature failed, in giuing it a perticuler receptacle, although it be beneficiall, but rather hath lodged it in the veines with the blood, there to be boyled, and made capable for nouriſhing of the body. Haruet obiecteth, that this rheume or phlegme, holds no part of an excrement, but is naturall and elementarie, to wit, a fourth humor

of blood. I aunſwer, that by conference of other humors, which are of the nature of excrements, it ſhould appeare manifeſtly, that that place of Galen, is vnderſtood by excrementall phlegme: for ſo he compares all the excrements. As (ſaith he) among the diuers kinds of gall, one is profitable & naturall in the creatures, the other vnprofitable & out of nature: euen ſo in the phlegme, that which is ſweet, is healthfull and naturall in the liuing creature, that which is ſharpe & ſalt, is out of nature. Moreouer, that it is ſo, that in all concoction, there is ſome excrement ſeparated from the food: which then ſhall be the excrement of the elementary phlegme? For the iuyce melancholick hath his excrement, the bilious or cholerick alſo hath his, neither is it that which is lodged in the ſtomack and the inteſtines: for it is not as yet come ſo far as the liuer, where

the office is performed of this concoction.
            In briefe, phlegme is not held to haue any perticuler inſtrument, becauſe that if ſometime thorow want of eating, there ſhall be a defect of blood: the ſame turning it ſelfe on the blood ſide, ſhal ſerue as nutrimēt to theſe parts. For the naturall phlegme, it nouriſheth and maintayneth continually, not by power, and want of meat onely: but actually in the parts that are cold and moiſt. It is then an excrement, but profitable, which Galē, in the place before alleaged, ſaith, that abiding in the body, it may be changed. And the ſame, in the firſt of his Prognoſticks, he doth not any way contrarie, where hee calleth it, not as he doth heere, nouriſhment halfe boyled: but an excrement of the nouriſhment halfe boiled, whereof the body being filled,2.

               Haruet obiecteth two things, the firſt, in the Dropſie, named Anaſarca, (which the Latines call Intercus) all the parts of the body beeing ſwolne with phlegme or rheume: and yet notwithſtanding, the pacient at all times muſt haue foode giuen him, whereof if there by any want, hee ſeemes alwaies ready to giue vp the ghoſt. I aunſwere, that all fleame is not proper to nouriſh the bodie, but only that which is ſweet. Now, that of the dropſie is ſalt, by reaſon wherof, it putrifieth, and giues ill ſent alſo to the parts which it toucheth, & Galen calleth it baleful, or murdrous: the which, becauſe it is commixed with ſome other humours, not onely changeth his true & naturall cullor (as Galen ſaith in the ſame place) but alſo his temperature: ſo that by

               Hippocrates & Galen, it is more often6. Aph. 14. et ſect. 4. Aph. 482. coac. deſigned by the word water, then of phlegme or rheume. By meanes whereof, Serenus calleth it Aquoſus languor, and Horace he termeth it, Aquoſus

            This ſolution may ſatisfie alſo the obiection which he makes ſoone after, concerning the excrements of the ſick, which (ſaith hee) if they haue power to nouriſh during the time of ſickneſſe, wherefore then, (they beeing conſumed,) doth not the ſickneſſe it ſelfe ceaſſe? And if the ſickneſſe ceaſſe, wherefore are all the parts of the bodie in themſelues ſo abated? Alas (good man) thoſe excrements are altogether againſt nature, and the bodie deſires nothing more, then to be deliuered of them, as Galen ſpeakes of the yellowe fat2. De

                  c. humour. This is more ſtrong, then where hee ſaith a little before, that Ioubert concludes not well, ſaying,

that if the ventricle bee filled with the phlegmatick-humour, it hath no appetite at all; why ſo in like manner, all the parts of the (bodie being filled) they cannot haue any deſire or hunger. For this appetite of the ventricle, whereof heere is ſome queſtion made, it is an animall appetite, which not being ſo in the other parts, this fleame cannot communicate herſelfe to them in the ſame manner. I anſwere, that there are two ſorts of appetite in the ventricle, the animall, and the naturall. The animall appetite, is a certaine moleſtation and anguiſh of the ventricle, proceednig of the ſucking, or of the compresſion of the foode, for and by the which, beeing angrie or offended, it deſireth meate. And the naturall appetite, is a ſtrength, bred and borne in all parts of the bodie, which deſireth euermore what it wanteth, and is thereto agreeable.

The one is appeaſed by the vapour of the meates receiued, and, by how little ſoeuer it be of ſubſtaunce: the other, by the only application hee makes of the meates. The animall appetite is perticuler to the ſole ventricle, the naturall is common, as well to the ventricle, as to all the other partes, by the which, beeing brought to the orifice ſuperiour of the ſame ventricle, it exciteth the animall appetite, which ſerues vs as a ſpurre for the deſiring of our meates. So long then as the rawe humour and phlegmatick remaineth at the ventricle, and that there (by the naturall ſtrength thereof,) it is boyled and brought into an eſtate: the 
                  •
               unicles, which make the bodie of the ventricle, in taking their competent portion, and the beſt therof, doo conuert the ſame to their owne profit. So the naturall appetite being contented, the anima
                  •
               l appetite is

not offended at all, or complaines at entraunce of the ventricle. If all the bodie were full of one and the ſame humour, all the parts to whom this appetite is common, and communicateth the ſtrength of this emotion, would borrowe thereof, and drawe thence what ſhould bee ſeruiceable for them.
            Theſe are the arguments, wherwith the learned Ioubert hath fortified his opinion: arguments, which (in my iudgement) vntill this inſtant houre, there could be no one found, that did knowe deſeruedly how to ſtand againſt them. VVherto there are ioyned many examples, both of plants and other creatures, that not only preſerue thēſelues many dayes, but alſo many yeares, without any nouriſhment taken outwardly. As in plants, the Onyon and the Garlick &c: in graine, VVheate Re, Barley, Oates, Millet and others:

in and among beaſtes, Serpents, Lizardes, Dormiſe, Beares, Crocodiles and Cameleons▪. Of which examples, Haruet ſtriues to weaken the authoritie, by oppoſition of the diſſimulitude and great diſproportion, which is betweene the life of brute beaſtes, (yea, much more of plants,) & that of man: becauſe his principall is referred to the reaſonable ſoule, and theirs to the ſoule vnreaſonable, and beſide, that heate (the inſtrument thereof) is much more noble in man, then in the vnreaſonable ſoule, and yet more in the vnreaſonable ſoule, then in the plant. VVherto I anſwere, that the ſimilitude of theſe examples, doo very well agree together, in that kinde of life whereof we ſpeake in this place, which is, the facultie of nouriſhing and feeding of the bodie, which is equally diſtributed, as well in beaſtes as in2.

                  tle. And moreouer,

that they agree in the kinde of the cauſe, to wit, the rawe & phlegmatique humour, wherewith their bodies are as well filled, as thoſe of men. But who can (ſaith Har

I anſwere, that this humour abounding in cruditie, ſeethes it ſelfe in the bodie there, and yet hurtes it not at all: for, beeing according to nature, it cannot create any accidents and diſeaſes againſt nature. He will obiect (perhaps) that the ſole abounding of fleame, cauſeth an apoplexie. But I ſay, that it is an excrement properly of the braine, which hath not bin wunt to goe lodge it ſelfe at the ventricles therof, nor doth, except it be driuen by the

ſpirit, or the vapour. He will ſay, that in theſe natures, the ſpirits are more feeble, and haue not power ſufficient, to make ſo great a violence or impetuoſitie. VVherto I reply, albeit that (otherwiſe) the exerciſe of the bodie is healthfull, ſaith Galen, yetCom. 3. Aph. 20. neuertheleſſe, if you will exerciſe a man full of fleame, or of one and the other choller, or elſe full of bloode, you ſhal forward him (by ſuch exerciſe) either to an Epilepſie, or Apoplexie.
            Now, where hee ſaith, that our life is differing from that of Plants & beaſts, and that her principle, which is our ſoule, is much more noble thē the others: what is he that wil deny it? whē 
               Aristotle himſelfe belieued, that ſhe onely was diuine, and came from abroade or without, to lodge within our bodie? But becauſe hee encloſeth within his obiection, the vegetatiue ſoule of Plants, and the

ſenſitiue of beaſts: it behooueth to let him know, that our body hath a vegetatiue ſoule, and nouriſheth it ſelfe as a Plant, ſenſeth or ſenteth as a brute beaſt, and hath the diſcourſe of reaſon, of which it makes vſe as a man. For, marke but his beginning (ſaith the ſame Aristotle) he liueth as the plant, and hath onely then the vegetatiue ſoule: afterward, in time, he gaines the ſenſitiue, & at length comes the intellectuall and reaſonable, which bringeth (with it) all perfections. For he is not all at one time both an animall and a man, nor an animall and an horſe, (though this reaſon be ſcant ſeemly in the mouth of a Chriſtian Philoſopher,) but he

                   med. But Haruet continues on yet, and prooueth by Hippocrates, that our elders

would neuer haue ſought out a proper manner of feeding for man, if one ſelfe ſame drinking & eating, might haue ſuffiſed for the nouriſhment both of men and beaſts. Neuertheleſſe, he omitteth that which Hippocrates addeth, that in the firſt age, men vſed one ſelfe-ſame foode, as the other creatures did, when the inuention of ſowing and planting was as yet vnknowne to them: then they fedde on fruites, which nature (on her owne good will) brought foorth, without any tillage: howbeit notwithſtanding, the omnipotent Creator of man, had a wil from the beginning, that he ſhould not only feed on the fruites of the earth, but alſo that he ſhould vſe the vnreaſonable creatures for his nouriſhment.
            VVhat would he haue Hippocrates to ſay more? That which our auncients then did, declared a will to

prouide for the infirmitie of our naturall heat, which beeing ſometimes vnable to digeſt thoſe meates, that were too crude & raw: is now better ſupplied and maintained, by ſuch as are prepared and corrected, by knowledge and experience, in the dooing whereof, the health of man is the leſſe ſubiect to perrill. Otherwiſe, a man might take & eate without danger (if he had been thereto accuſtomed) of Hemlocke with the Stare; and of Helleborus with the Quaile; or, as Mithridates, vſe poyſons, not to be poyſoned: and he being inured to ſuch a cuſtome, they were to him as naturall viands. In like manner, an old man of Athens (recorded by Galen) vſed familiarly3. De fimpl. fac. Lib. 9. hiſt. Plant. cap. 18. Ariſt▪ de reg. prin. to eate Hemlock: as Thraſiaes did the like of Helleborus, by report of Theophraſtus. A mayden beeing ſent by the King of the Indiaes to Alexander, ſhe did a long time feede before

euery one, of Napellus, called VVoolfes-bane, without any preiudice to herſelfe.
            But without all theſe, the earth (our good Mother) hath not ſhee brought foorth from her boſome, many other thinges neceſſary to maintaine life? yes truly hath ſhe, & (in the eſtate as ſhe receiues vs, whē wee come to arriue in the Inne of this world) ſhe therafter entertaines and feedeth vs: ſhewing herſelfe alwaies benigne, ſweet, indulgent, & ready, to do whatſoeuer ſhe can deuiſe to ſerue our vſe.
            VVhen ſhee is tilled and husbanded, what diuerſitie of foodes doth ſhe produce, proper and apt for our nouriſhing? How plenteouſly is ſhe furniſhed without tillage? vvhat odours? what fauours? what iuyces? what cullers? And yet (in this while) we will needs exerciſe our crueltie vpon the brute beaſts, we will keepe

thoſe creatures impriſoned, to whō Nature hath giuen the free wide palace of heauen. VVhy are not vvee more carefull, to make our bankets in ſimplicitie, and without butcherie, after the manner of Pythagoras: rather then to war in the ayre, aduē

            The Philoſopher Apollonius Thyaneus, beeing demaunded by the Emperour Domitian, why hee kept not the common manner of feeding, which cōſiſted in the vſage of fleſh, but rather did eate rootes & fruites, ſuch as the earth yeelded? returned this anſwer.

Haruet thinks, that they eate the prouiſion they haue hidden, & labours himſelfe againſt Ariſtotle, ſaying: that ſleepe euacuates the body, when as the ventricle is emptied, by reaſon of the heate, which euermore conſumeth the moiſture.

They (ſaith Hippocrates) which in the night are thirſtie, it is good for them to ſleep, euen then when they are very dry. For ſleepe (aboue all things) doth moiſten the body with great ſtore of pleaſing: not the bodie which is wholy emptie and dry, but that which is filled with foode,

or with crude moiſture, the naturall facultie (in this while) is buſying it ſelfe to her vttermoſt power, for the concoction of the meates, and the raw humours. VVho wil doubt then, that a ſlothfull creature, & full of cruditie, may not fatten himſelfe by ſleeping?

               Ariſtotle, the Prince of truth, writes, that in the Furnaſes, where the Melters & caſters of Copper are in Cypres, they haue a little creature, of the bignes of a great Fly, which they call Pyrauſta, the which hath wings, & ſoure feet. So long as there

is fire in the Furnace, this worme or Fly liueth, but let it be neuer ſo little off from it, it preſently dies: and yet notwithſtanding, this creature is moſt cold, hauing no other maintenaunce then the heat of the fire onelie.
            But why ſhould I dwell on theſe examples, whereof Haruet (in euerie place) holds, that wee can draw no conſequent by them to men? Peraduenture then, ſome examples deduced from men themſelues, may make him to acknowledge a truth. And therefore I will produce one, which is out of all ſcruple, whereof, Princes worthy of beleefe, made recitall to King Henry the third, being in Poland. Hee had there many great Lords of Fraunce, Councellours, &c. He had alſo diuers Phiſitians in his Court, & among others, Monſieur Piduxius our Deane: skilfull not onely in Phiſicke, but likewiſe,

in whatſoeuer concerned the knowledge of the naturall hiſtorie. Hee was then Phiſitian to my Lord the Duke of Neuers, and called to councell with the Kings owne Phiſitians. From him was it, that wee verbally heard this Hiſtorie, which alſo is written by Alexander Guaguinus of Verona, Captaine of the footmen in the Cittadell of Vitebcka, on the limits of Moſcouia, and in his deſcription of the ſaid Country.
            Hee ſaith, that there are certaine people in Lucomoria (which is a Region, in the vtmoſt confines of the Sarmates towards the North) which dye, (or rather remaine entraunced, like your Frogges and Swallowes) euery yeare, the 27. of the moneth Nouember, by reaſon of the extreame colde in that part of the countrie. Afterward, at the returne of Spring-time, the 24. of Aprill, they come to life againe. Theſe

people make their commerces with the Grustintzians and Sperponomptzians their neighbours, after this manner. VVhen they feele the time of their entrauncing to draw neere, they then lock vp their merchandiſes in certaine places, and the Gruſtintzians and Sperponomptzians there take them, and leaue other in their ſted, of anſwerable value. The time being come of their reui
                  •
               ing, they take the merchandiſes, which were left in exchaunge of theirs, if they perceiue they haue profit by them: if not, they demaund back their owne againe, whereby ariſeth oftentimes quarrels, and warres betweene them. By this ſleepie traunce, the natural heate in theſe bodies (which otherwiſe are accuſtomed to this ayre, and boyled againe, as ſayth Albertus Cr
                     ••

being lockt vp and ſtopte, it gathers it ſelfe about the entrailes, and by this Antiperistaſis or repulſion of euery part, ſhe encreaſeth herſelfe, and makes her power the more vigorous for the Spring-time enſuing.
            Aboue all other partes of the bodie, the daunger is principallie of the braine, which hath great ſtore of large openings, and (among others) the noſtrilles: were it not, that whē they beginne to wexe ſtiffe with colde, a tarte rheume or moiſture diſtilleth from the noſtrilles, which (by report of the ſaid Lord Piduxius)

By meanes whereof, the noſtrilles and other parts being lockt vp; the

mallice of the ayre cannot ſo eaſilie pierce vp vnto the braine. And if any one of them, to ſhunne this colde vnfreendlines of the ayre, thinkes (by couering himſelfe with skinnes and other things) to foreſtall the Iſicles hanging at the noſtrilles and mouth &c: immediatly, the ayre being exceſsiuely cold, ſteps vp into the braine, and there extinguiſheth the naturall heate, ſo that theſe Lucomorians, in ſted of a temporall entrauncing, do then fall into a perpetuall and endleſſe. But the time being come, that the Sunne getteth rule ouer the colde, and brings in agayne the ſweetnes of the Spring ſeaſon: the ycie moiſture (at the parts before named) melting it ſelfe, the heate by little & little inſinuates into the bones, the feeling and vigour creepes againe into all the mē

               Haruet concludes his whole diſcourſe, by the faſting of holy perſonages, Moyſes, Elias, & our bleſſed Sauiour, the which (ſaith hee) ſhould be held for no miracle at all, if, according to nature, ſo long an abſtinence may be made. Ioubert hath anſwered, that in ſick perſons, and ſuch as are much ſubiect to ſickneſſe, a long faſt or abſtinence is naturall: but ſupernaturall in ſuch perſons, who otherwiſe are perfectly well, and of good temperature.

albeit ſome others (in like manner diſeaſed) haue afterward bin healthfull againe.
