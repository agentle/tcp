            To the Learned, and my worthily respected friends, D. BONHAM, and Maister NICHOLAS CARTER Physitions.
            
               BEE not offended, worthie Doctor, if I presume to parallel you with a Physition, which netther is nor wilbe dubbed Doct. for any mans pleasure, nor cares a whit for any clothing in Bysse, how worthy soe
                  •
               er. For the which I blame him the lesse, sithence neither Aesculapius, Hippocrates, Galen, Auicen, nor any other of the old stampe euer assumed any such title, though better giuen them. But tempora mutantur, and therefore now adaies for distinction and decorum sake it is very conuenient

and necessarie to giue such attributes, especially to men indowed with so excellent a qualitie as the true knowledge of Physicke, and guift of healing is. But how vilely this worthie Science and profession is traduced and abused! Witnesse the multitude of Mounte-bankes, Quack-saluers, Horse-leaches, Cunning-women, Imposters and Vpstarts, who hauing learned (my chance) the Calcining of Mercurie, the preparation of Antimony, or the composition of some home-spun medicine, and hauing scraped together some triuiall experiments out of some old Manuscripts, or from some brazen-fac't Bragadotio, will presently forsooth set the Physition at open defiance, boasting and protesting that they haue saued the life of twentie, whom such and such a Physition had quite forsaken and giuen ouer for dead. Nay I haue heard a good fellow (I will not say a Pharmacopaean, and that no simple one neither) bouldly affirme that if hee should not now and then adde or diminish something from the Physitions Bill, the fat were in the

fire, and twere as much as the Patients life were worth, aggrauating the matter in such manner that my very eares haue glowed to heare it, seeing that by this their scandalous detraction, they arrogate to themselues and impose vpon the simple people, bringing them into fooles paradise! But the Physitions are well enough serued, for if they would expulse one packe of these, snaffle another, and take a little paines with Fernelius, to prepare or see prepared their principall Medicines, and not to be so idle as to giue too much credit to the Druggist, nor let each giddie-headed fellow be partaker of their secrets, it were doubtlesse better for the Common wealth, more profitable vnto themselues, and more pleasing vnto God: but of this inough. There resteth nothing now (my worthy friends) but that you would vouchsafe to stand betwixt me and such malicious detractors; for if they dare baspheme the tall Cedars, what will they not doe vnto the lower shrubs. The subiect of this treatise is so well knowne vnto you, that howsoeuer

some nice and scrupulous persons may make question of the veritie of the passages, or of the safetie and excellencie of the medicine, you are so well instructed in the composition and vertue thereof, that no wise man will oppose you, some may imagine that I might haue made better choice of some famous and remarkable Collegians for my patrons, but vnto you onely, and vnto that worthie Doctor Gwin am I obliged, whose multiplicity of learning, iudgement and discretion, accompanied with affabilitie, humanitie and curtesie is more then apparantly knowne to all your acquaintance; Let me therefore craue this boone at your hands, that you would accept this simple translation as a testimony of my louing remēbrance towards you, and that you would defend it from the obtrectations of scandalous tongues, and you shall euer make mee
            
               Yours, THO. BRETNOR.
            
         
         
            
            To the ingenious and indifferent Reader.
            
               THE cause moouing mee (curteous Reader) to trāslate and publish this smal Pamphlet, was not onely the scarsitie of the French Copies, but the especiall want of such a Treatise in our owne mother-tongue: for not onely the rude multitude and men of some iudgement through vaine delusion and superstitious feare, but many Physitions themselues through a Galenicall perswasion, make no small question and scruple whether Opium may bee taken inwardly or not; Nay, I haue knowen men of good discretion so farre infatuated by conceipt and

heare say as they haue rather chosen to indure intollerable paines then they would take three poore graines of well prepared Laudanum: but I cannot greatly blame them, for the naked truth is, many moderne Physitions know not well what to make of it. Forestus Montanus and many others with Galen absolutely conclude, that it is stupefying and cold in the fourth degree at least, and therefore not fit to be inwardly taken at all, but in Syncopes and extreame necessitie; Mercatus is indifferent. Capiuaccius is forced by common experience to grant with Auicen, that for its foure degrees of coldnesse it is furnished with three of heate in operation.
            But Platerus, Bauhinus, Zwingerus, Scaliger, Quercitanus and others affirme with Rhasis, that Opium is rather hot then cold, seeing that in tasting thereof it doth Palatum & linguam vrere, caput tentare, Sudorem prouocare, venerem promouere, sitim excitare, pruritum

insignem parere, animositatem fi
                     •
                  e potius furorem inducere, and being outwardly applied doth (contrarie to all cold things) blister the skinne, discusse and mollifie hard tumors and nodes. But whether it bee hot or cold it skils not much, seeing it is confessed of all true Physitions, that it doth ex forma specifica, naturally resist putrefaction and wonderfully and speedily release the bodie from intollerable paines: for, let the torments or griefe proceed from what cause soeuer, either hot or cold, inward or outward it worketh the same effects, so that this onely Medicine well prepared would doubtlesse saue many thousand mens liues that trauaile or faile, sub aequatore vel polo Arctico, into the East Indies or Northerne discoueries, vnder the hottest or coldest climes in the world, seeing it resembles much the oyle of Vitrioll, Vinegar, Chymicall salts and such like, which are giuen with good successe as well in cold as hot diseases: but what

needs many words seeing the Author himselfe hath sufficiently discouered the benefit hereof, I onely wish you to haue great regard to its preparation: for as in most Physicall Drugges there remaineth some bad qualitie or other which needeth correction, so doth Opium require Vulcans helpe, and other specificall meanes to driue away its sulphurous malignitie: you may read in Quercetane his answere to Anonimus Cap. 2. and in Sennertus his Institutions Lib. 5. part. 3. Sect. 2. Cap. 1. that the ancient fathers of Physicke made their chiefest Medicines with their owne hands, and intituled them after their owne names, which many retaine to this day, but now the case is altered;
The Merchant he will haue his Factor, his Casher and his Broker too, the Grocer his Garbler, the Vintner his Cooper, the Gold-smith his Forger, the Draper his Cloath-worker and Drawer too, the Physition his Apothecarie, The Apothecarie his Druggist

and his Workeman too: for few of them make all their owne Medicines. In briefe Iohn wilbe a Gentleman at least. But me thinkes, the life of man (so pretious a thing in the sight of God) should not be so little esteemed of as I feare it is in posting ouer hither and thither, I would be loath to be mistaken, or haue any man thinke I goe about to correct magnificat, or teach others hauing neede of instruction my selfe, but ingeniously (as any conscionable man ought) declare my opinion, and to let the friendly Reader know how hee may bee abused if hee looke not about him; for mine owne part, I wilbe so bold, if able, as to prepare the chiefest Physicke I vse my selfe, and for the Medicine handled in this booke, they may haue it well don of my friend Harbert Whitfield in Newgate-Market, of Maister Bromhall, who hath conferred with the Author and some others, no doubt about this towne. And so intreating

thy gentle patience for these rude lines, and thy kinde acceptance of this homely translation while better is abreeding, I euer rest,
            
               
                  Studious of thy health, THO. BRETNOR.
            
         
         
            
            The Authour his Preface to the Reader.
            
               
                  I
                Make no question (Curteous Reader) but as soone as this little Pamphlet shall come abroade, there wilbe some which will presently beginne to taxe mee; saying, what fellow is this Sala? will hee (like a Master) teach vs what Opium is, and how wee should prepare an excellent Medicine thereof called Laudanum, which will presently appease all griefes of the bodie, extinguish all extreame heates in Feuers, stay all Fluxes of the belly, pro
                  •
               oke quiet rest to the diseased, &c. are not these onely two things, the one whereof hath beene disclosed to the world many ages agoe, the other reuealed to vs of late by sundry moderne Physitions, so that wee stand not in need of his instructions, hee might well inough haue spared his breath, to haue cooled his pottage.
            To whom I answere first (concerning the naturall propertie of Opium) by demanding of them

what ancient Physition was there euer, who hath written of, or declared the nature and vse of this Medicine so well, or so amply giuen such infallible and true reasons of its vertue and energie, but there may remaine some gap open, or some subiect or other to worke vpon, wherein they may bee controuled, and whereto or from whence a man may adde or diminish something more or lesse: beleeue me (I thinke) they would haue much adoe to finde me such an Author; for if it were so, to what ende should they dispute so often in their publike Academies and priuate consultations of the naturall qualities of Opium? were it not a notable argument of vaine curiositie rather then of solid iudgement or discretion to dispute against a doctrine already reduced into necessary and irreproueable Maximes as they imagine? But the naked truth is, that the vse of Opium is yet doubtfull among the greatest part of Physitions: which being granted, I know no reason but that if it bee lawfull for an other to argue and dispute of many things beside the common conceipt and apprehension of the Ancient: it cannot be accompted idlenesse or vani
                  •
               ie in me to vtter my opinion also being grounded vpon rationall termes, and agreeable to the authoritie as well of ancient and moderne Sages as mine owne peculiar experience and obseruations, collected and gathered for the instruction and benefit of such onely as shall haue occasion to make

good vse of them, not taking vpon me in this tract or any other to teach any man; much lesse those which thinke they know already much more then my selfe.
            
            Secondly (concerning that obiection that diuers Physitions haue written and made mention already of the Chymicall preparation of Opium as a principall ingredience into that excellent Medicine called Laudanum) I deny not their assertion, but rather rely vpon their authoritie, and am partly satisfied with such things as they haue already divulged, as may appeare hereafter, yet notwithstanding the whole world can beare mee witnesse that neither Laudanum nor the vse thereof haue beene things commonly knowne; for it is a thing most certaine, that among a hundred Physitions and Practitioners in Europe, a man can hardly finde fiftie that will take paines to read ouer the workes of Paracelfus, or any other Spagitique which hath written of this subiect; much lesse can the thing it selfe bee common or familiar vnto them: among those fiftie a manshall hardly finde twentie which make vse of it: among those twentie it were strange to finde ten which are able to prepare it with their owne hands, and among those ten it were rare to finde three which durst freely publish or manifest its vertues to the world, or propound the vse thereof in their priuate and particular consultations for the benefit of the diseased; or

maintaine the same for such a soueraigne thing as it is indeed.
            I am very well assured that although the most part of our Physitions here at the Hage doe sometimes make vse of this Medicine, yet a man may trauaile into a hundred Cities in Christendon
                  •
                where the Physitions neither vse it nor make any more accompt of it then of a thing altogether strange vnknowne and of no vse in the world.
            Furthermore, if we come to a popular examination thereof, I am perswaded that in this very Citie (notwithstanding the aforesayd) among a thousand men and women which know the name and vse of Treakle, Mithridate and other ordinary Medicinall compositions, and can apply them to their best vse and behoofe when they are diseased or sicke, yet a man can hardly find twentie of them which haue once in their liues heard one speake of Laudanum, the knowledge whereof no question had beene as requisite and necessarie as of either of the aforenamed. What great matter is it then if Iames, Martin, Francis, &c. knew what Laudanum is, and the vse thereof, when so many thousand men know nothing at all, many of them in the meane time languishing and complayning of extreame paines and want of sleepe euen to death, and can finde no ease at all, vnlesse by meanes of this excellent and pretious secret, or such like: Well then, Let vs put the case that this my Treatise were

good for nothing else but to inlarge and make knowne the name of Laudanum among the rude multitude to giue them occasion (when time and oportunitie shall serue) to inquire and demaund for it of their Physitions, or of others which shall haue the same by them, whereby they may be assisted and fortified against sundry daungerous accidents which by no other meanes can be so qu
                  •
               ckely, safely or easily auoyded; so that if it were for no other reason then this, my labours (me thinkes) were not vnworthie regard; but the profit which may redound to many persons by this discouery is not small, as the discreet Reader may easily perceiue hereafter. To conclude with the common prouerbe, As hee cannot spit sweete whose throat is full of gall, no more can such as are stuffed with their owne passions (thinking themselues onely wise) euer speake well, or commend others labour or knowledge then their owne, yet notwithstanding, neither these nor any other obstacles whatsoeuer, either ought or can hinder the good will and entire affection of him which desi
                  •
               eth the aduancement of Art to Gods glorie, the benefit of his neighbour and his owne priuate ioy and contentment.

               Whether Chymicall Medicines in generall are more violent and dangerous then other ordinarie Medicines are; and whether in respect thereof a man may lawfully administer them except in desperate diseases onely as some imagne?
            
            A man shall finde some Physitions in the world which (hauing no skill in Chymicall art) being demanded of their patients and other people, what they imagine and thinke of Chymicall Medicines and their vse ingenerall, will not altogether blame and reprooue them (as not long since many d
                  •
               d) but in answering perhaps will say, the Medicines are ind
                  •
               fferent good, but are alwaies more violent and dangerous in their operations then other ordinarie Medicines are, in regard whereof they ought not to be vsed but in desperate d
                  •
               seases onely.
            Therfore before we speake any more of Opium, or the Chymicall preparation thereof (for the better purging of chymicall Medicines and such as vse them from suspition and blame) I thinke it fittest to resolue this question on this fashion.
            First, it may bee easily perceiued, that these Learned M. M. by this maner of answering fall into a double error, and are therefore worthily taxed in two principall points which makes their consequence vnsauery and idle. First, that they

iudge and censure of things whereof they haue no skill, nor exact experience at all, so that what they answere in this point, is either by some vaine coniecture, blind tradition, or idle report; secondly, by making no distinction betweene generall and particular, they condemne all Chymicall Medicines without exception to be such as a foresaid.
            But leauing to reproue the former of these two points, as a thing exploded by each discreet mans conceipt, let vs insist a little to confute the later: in pro
                  •
               ing that they wrongfully impose violence and churl
                  •
               shnesse to chymicall Medicines, seeing that vnder this generalitie they doe not only condemne those excellent Vomiteries and Cathartickes of Antimonie and Mercurie, but also all other kinde of Vomitiues, both meane and gentle, all kind of Vegetable, Deiectories or Purgatiues from the strongest to the weakest, euen from Scammonie to Aloes and so the very Rose, as also all other formes and degrees of Medicines, whether they be Diaphoreticke, Diureticke, Vulnerarie, Be

                  •
               tted to diuers parts of the bodie, or resisting diseases of diuers natures, and finally all other kind of wholesome and necessary Medicines, vsed generally as wel among the Spag
                  •
               riques as other ordinary Physitions, differing only in maner of their composition and preparation.
            
               Hereby you may at first dash perceiue that if they would speake any thing against the vehemence which may subsist in any Chymicall Medicine whatsoeuer, they should change this generall enuntiation into a more particular, and say, among Chymicall Medicines there be some which be vehement and not to say absolutely and generally that all Chymicall Medicines are so in performance whereof we will do them right, and presently draw them to confesse that wee onely haue not some vehement and churlish medicines, but that they themselues also haue the like, no man can deny.
            Seeing therefore we accord in this (as wee cannot choose) if they will further aggrauate the former accusation, they must of necessitie prooue that chymicall medicines of a vehement nature are more churlish and daungerous then their ordinary Medicines of the same nature are, as also that their milde and gentle Physicke Chymically prepared, becommeth more dangerous then before, but (alas good men) they can proue no such matter.
            For primarily touching those Chymicall Medicines, which they pretend to be vehement (as those of Antimonie and Mercurie vomitiue) there is no question made among vnderstanding Physitions (besides daily experience) that being compared with those vehement vomits which the auncien
                  •
                Physitions haue prescribed, as those of white Hellebore,

Tythimalls, Spurges, &c. they would bee found as gentle and familiar in their operations, a
                  •
                Sena and Rheubarbe are in comparison of Scammonie, Colocynthis, and other vehement and alt
                  •
               
               ratiue purgatiues.
            And furthermore, if they should say that they neither vse white Hellebore, nor Tithymalls in regard of their venemous proprieties, or because they are found daungerous in working, this is the thing wee looke for at their hands, for they can neuer make it appeare, that either Antimony or Mercurie well prepared cause any such Symptomes in the bodie as these doe: or if they esteeme it a thing fit and requisite to desist from the institutions of ancient Physitions, exploding the vse of such Medicines which they finde to be daungerous; we thinke it far
                  •
               e more rationall on the other part, (obseruing the main end of the foresaid intentions, and so cutting off quite the vsage of euill things,) to appoint and ordaine in their roome such as are more gentle and familiar.
            Here they may finde fault (but nothing to the purpose) and say that they custome to make sicke people to vomit is very daungerus, and therefore to that intent they ought to vse no Med
                  •
               cine at all▪ &c. But hauing sufficiently answered this obiection, and proued the contrarie in my Treatise intituled Emetologia, concerning the nature and vse of vomitiue Medicines, I thinke it

needlesse to repeate the same in this place.
            If notwithstanding what is said these M. M. persist in their opinio
                  •
               , saying that Antimonie and Mercurie, are Medicines not so free from Maligne qualitie as I pretend, but that that they in-here and cleaue to the guts, and leaue some secret infection in the blood or Radicall humours, the which in continuance of times comes to manifest it selfe. And these are those common nuisances which many obiect, thinking thereby to drawe mens, affections after their owne fantasies.
            But this vaine opinion is quickely confuted by plaine and euident demonstration when they please, for most men which take either Antimonie or Mercurie well prepared, evacuate or cast the same out into the vessell, whereinto they vomit euen at the very first operation of the Medicine either vpward, or downeward, so that it hath beene often found in the excrements, when nature did worke that way first, as sometimes it falleth out.
            Secondly, these (being mettallicke and fixed bodies) cannot bee concocted, or brought into chyle or naturall nutriment by any meanes, whence it consequently followeth that they cannot intermixe themselues with the blood, or any other substance of the bodie, as all other vegetable and animall Medicines may easily doe, in regard of that Symbolization

they haue with the foresaid substances, so that the stomacke may reduce them into chyle at pleasure, which is the cause also that the poysons of euill plants, serpents and other venemous creatures are more actiue, sodaine and piercing then Arsink it selfe or Realgar minerall.
            I could produce a number of other reasons to demonstrate that Chymicall Medicines of a vehement nature, as principally the two before named (against which all this controuersie doth particularly arise) are more gentle then any violent vomitiue Medicine which our Ancients prescribed, yea farre more safe then any vomitorie vnder Hellebore or any aboue named: but to auoide long discourse let these suffice at this time.
            Now let vs come to resolue our selues whether those ordinarie Medicines which be naturally gentle and without any offensiue qualitie, after chymicall preparation change their naturall mildenesse, into that which is euill, and so become vehement and dangerous.
            Concerning which point wee haue in this discourse alreadie spoken some thing in defence of purgatiue Medicines, as those of more frequent vse then others among diseased persons, and therefore wilbe contented to determine the whole matter in the generall defence of Diaphoretickes, Diureticks, Alexiteries, &c. chymically prepared.
            First, therefore it must of necessity be granted of

all opponents that euery Medicine ingenerall bereaued of its earthinesse and seculencie▪ and made pure cleane and well digested by fire must of consequence be lesse hurtfull, lesse dangerous, and lesse offensiue, and is also farre more apt to worke, ci
                     •
                  òtutò & miundè (as the Physitions wish) then any crude, earthie, impure or ill prepared Medicine may or can doe by any meanes' possible; the reason is, that when such ill-prepared stuffe is once gotten into the stomacke of any diseased person, nature (alreadie strugling against the disease) becommeth thereby more wearied, ouer-cloyed and oppressed in concocting and seperating the pu
                  •
               enesse from the impurenesse of such drugges then it was before, and therefore can receiue very little or no comfort at all by such Medicines, whereas on the contrary part other medicines (made subtill, actiue, pure and well prepared by art) doe begin to disperce and dilate themselues gently into all parts of the bodie as soone as they are receiued thereinto, and being neuer so little exagitated or moued by naturall heate assist nature her selfe without any alteration or disturbance at all, and like a good friend aide and promone her; whereas the other wearieth and tormenteth the body like a Tyrant. Moreouer wee may consider that Chymicall Medicines being pure and neate, as aforesaid, leaue no feculent residence or corruption in the bodie at all, as others commonly doe.
            
               But if it commeth to passe (as it is not vnlikely) that some should deny these reasons, obiecting that Chymicall Medicines being subtill and pure, can more easily disturbe nature, and moue the body more sodainely then other Medicines do; to whom we answere, that although among our Chymicall Medicines, there bee some of a subtill Nature, as our distilled oyles, the quintessence of wine, and other vegetables: and as there be diuers liquors (we acknowledge) very sharpe and piercing; so in like manner be there some diseases, wherein such Medicines be very requisite and necessary, whereas others of a crosse, seculent, and clammy substance can yeeld no ease or comfort at all; in regard whereof wee ought not to accompt them daungerous or hurtfull, but rather very beneficiall and wholesome, especially being well applyed and vsed a
                  •
                all Medicines of what nature soeuer ought to bee.
            But vnder colour of these no man ought to comprehend other Chymicall Medicines, or proclaime them to bee of such a piercing nature, for comming to purgatiue Medicines extracted (being of a sappie, thicke, and condense forme) wee know well that they are not nor cannot bee so subtill or piercing as oyles, nor are called subtill in regarde of their penetratiue vertue, but rather because they are farre more easily conuerted into Liquors, then the substances from whence

they are extracted, and therefore ought in no ease to be called irritatiues.
            Experience her selfe teacheth vs that the extract of Mechoacan, Rheubarbe, or Sena (being gentle Med
                  •
               cines) duely administred, shew themselues farre more milde, gentle and effectuall then when they are exhibited after an entire and grosse preparation.
            But what need many words? doe we not plainely see that our Chymicall Art bringeth Colocynthis and Scammonie (acrimonious and venemous purgatiues) 
                  •
               o bee so gentle and milde in operation, that a man may as safely and freely administer them as Rheubarbe, hauing onely regard to the qualitie of the disease, and the humour they naturally purge? as namely that of Scammonie whereof a man may boldly giue to one of a strong constitution twentie graines at a time, in sugar rosat, or any other conserue; And this will worke easily and well, without any touch of paine, perturbance or inflammation in the bowells, as otherwise it would surely do.
            And this is a Maxime that not only Scammonie, but euerie other purgatiue Medicine of such venemous and vehemēt nature as Hellebore, Tithymalls, &c. loose their acrimonie and maligne qualitie, and by meanes of this Art become gentle and effectuall in the extirpation of all such diseases as they naturally concerne or respect, without any

inconuenience or danger at all: and this is no vaine coniecture of mine owne braine, for I can produce a hundred sage and learned Physitions which can & will testifie and make this good as well as my selfe.
            And this is all which I purposed to speake at this time in defence of Chymicall Medicines, against the suggestions of scandalous tongues, not meaning or intendeng hereby to disgrace or vilipend those ordinarie Medicines, wherewith the world is and hath beene furnished and serued for so many ages together; for both the one and the other may be found good or euill according to the diuersitie of their vsage, notwithstanding I haue at all times indeuored my selfe to the vttermost of my power, to amplifie and illustrate the Art of Physicke for the comfort of the diseased (as euery one ought) without any passion or malice in condemning things newly inuented for Paradoxes and Heresies before due examination and triall.

               CHAPTER. 1. The opinion of Ancient Physitions, concerning the naturall proprietie and vertues of Opium.
               
                  
                     OPIVM (as ancient Physitions testifie and moderne confirme) is a certaine iuyce or viscous liquor which one time of the yeares destilleth or 
                     •
                  sue
                     ••
                   from the tops of white or blacke Popp
                        •
                     e, by me
                     •
                  nes of a little gash or incision made in the outtermost rind of them (as witnesseth Discordes in his fourth booke of Simples Chap. 60.) the which liquor after due condensation is reserued and layd vp for necessary vses, as may not only appeare by the History aforesaid, but by that of Peter Bellon hereafter recited.
               
                  Good Opium (as Diescordes and other Ancient Physitions affirme) is weightie and ponderous, bitter in tast, and is quickly dissolued in water, it is smooth and whitish and not rugged or lumpish, and being streined it doth not like waxe melt against the sun, being kindled it causeth not a blackish flame, and being quenched or put out, it alwaies retaineth its naturall smell.
               They ▪vse many times to sophisticate or mixe Opium with Glaucium, Gum, or the iuyce of wild lettice, but that which is sophisticated with Glaucium is easily discerned, for being cut into small peeces, it becommeth yellow; in like manner, if it be mixed with the iuyce of wild Lettice it becommeth more rugged and tart, and hath little or no smell at all; but if it be counterfeited with Gum, it will be bright & shyning in colour, but weake in operation.
               
                  Opium taken crude and raw, as asoresayd, to the quantitie of an Orobus or wild Fitch, appeaseth all Aches or paines, helpeth digestion, stayeth all Coughes and Destillations or Rheumes, which fall from the braine into the stomack, it is excellent against all kinde of Head-ach if the temples bee anointed and chaffed with the same and oyle of roses: being dropped or instilled into the eares with

the oyle of bitter Almonds, Mirrhe and Saffran, it healeth and recouereth Hearing, and the sooner being applied with the yolke of an egge hard rosted in the imbers: it auaileth much against inflammation of the eyes, and being mixed with vinegar is very good against Saint Anthonies fire, and healeth olde vlcers: with saffran and womans milke it is singular in gouts, and being mixed with Supposatories, it prouoketh sleepe.
               
                  Diagoras, Aetius and Mnesidemus disproue and finde fault with the vsage of Opium in the diseases afore-named, by reason of its stupefactiue qualitie, but Diescordes (affirming the lawfull vse thereof) maintaineth the contrary, and proueth their opinion to bee idle and false; seeing that the propertie of Opium is quite of another operation; yet hee ingeniously else-where confesseth, that the indiscreet and super
                     ••
                  uous vsage thereof produceth no small detriment to the patient, making him fall into a Lethargie, whereby death commonly insues; the which he further confirmeth in his sixth Booke and seuenteeth Chapter of Poysons, and their remedies, where hee reckoneth vp the Symptomes which it causeth in those bodies which haue eaten too much thereof.
               
                  Nicander and Aetius haue written of the

great annoyances that come thereby; and Gallen also in his second and third bookes D
                        •
                      Comp. Med. describeth Opium to bee a daungerous Medicine, saying, that it mortifieth the senses, and causeth deadly Symptomes, in regard whereof hee wisheth that no man should vse it, vnlesse his Patient bee in danger of death, through the extremitie of his paine, and, hereunto assenteth Plinie and diuers others: notwithstanding there bee no small number of moderne Physitions quite of another minde.
               The cause of those dangerous effects and Symptomes, which crude Opium by its too much vse is said to procure, is attributed to its exceeding coldnesse; for most Physitions hold, that it is not vnfitly ranged among things that are cold in the fourth degree.
               
                  A Small Tract of Opium, taken out of the 13 Booke and 15 Chapter of Peter Bellon his Historie of the singularities of some memorable things found in Greece, Asia, and other Countries.
                  A Man can hardly find (saith hee) any thing more worthy of obseruation then Opium, which they prepare now a daies in Turkie, and especially at Achara, Carachara,

Spartade, Emetelinde, and in other Cities bordering vpon Cappadocia, Paphlagonie and Cilicia.
                  
                  They sow their fields with white Poppie, as we do with corne, and are so circumspect in the sowing thereof, that euery Paysant or Husbandman shall sow no more then he can procure people to gather the same in due time, for when the Poppie is growne to be headed, they cut a small hole or make incision therein, whence issueth forth certaine milkish drops which they suffer to thicken or congeale: some one of these Peasa
                           •
                        ts will gather (may chance) ten pounds, another sixe, another more, or lesse, according to the number of people hee sets aworke, for it bootes nothing to sow a great deale of ground, vnlesse he can get people enough to gather it. Wee verily beleeue that vnlesse the Turkes vsed it much themselues, it would be as vnusually vended among Merchants, as other vnknowne drugges are, but it is so common among thē, that there is not a Turke but buyethmore or lesse thereof, for if he be worth but an Asper in all the world, hee will bestow halfe thereof in Opium, and carry the same at all times about as well in Peace as Warre.
                  A certaine Iewish Merchant, of the country of Natolia, assured vs that there passed no

yeares wherein there were not fiftie Camels laden out of Paphlagonia, Cappadocia, Galatia & Cilicia, to transport the same into Persia, India and Europe, and other parts of the Great Turkes Dominion in Africa and else where; the which we should haue hardly beleeued if hee had not related to vs by peece-meale (as it were) what quantitie might bee made and brought from each seuerall Village about the Confines of Carachora, and the Villages of Paphlagonia, Cappadocia, Armenia the lesse, and Gall
                           •
                        grecia, hee told vs moreouer that the Persians vsed it more aboundantly then the Turkes.
                  
                  Wee desired one day to make an experiment, and try how much Opium a man could take at a time without any offence or hurt, and wee found that a certaine Ianisarie of our acquaintance did vse to eate thereof euery daie, who tooke at one time in our presence the weight of halfe a Dragme, and meeting with him the next daie at a Mercers shop, wee caused him to weigh vs out a whole dragme, which wee gaue him, and hee swallowed it vp all at once without any daunger or hurt at all, sauing that for a while hee seemed like a drunken man.
                  To 
                        •
                     ate Opium in Turkie is no new

thing, and the reason why it is vsed so amongst them, is because they perswade themselues that it maketh them more aduenterous and lesse fearefull of daungers in warre, so that when the Turke assembleth or mustereth any great Armie together, they make such hauocke of their Opium, that they almost disfurnish the whole Countrie. They take it in as great snuffe amongst them, and accompt it as great an iniurie when one vpbraides another with eating of Opium, as another Countriman would do if one should call him a drunkard.
                  A Christian-Armenian, with whom wee lodged long time, vsed many times to eate Opium in our sight, and prouing the same our selues, we found no other accident, sauing that it heated our stomackes, troubled something the braine, and caused vs to sweat in our sleepe. Wee thinke that if men were disposed they might as easily plant and sow Poppie in France, Germanie, Italie, and some other places of Europe, as well as in Asia, if they would but take the paines to dresse and gather it as they should doe, for surely the Climate of Natolia is as colde as that of France. It is made in the same manner as Authors doe describe, but I am affraide if wee haue anie brought

ouer hither it is sophisticated & mingled, for the Merchants do questionles multiply it before they vent it abroad into the Countries, and therefore because we know some marks and tokens how to choose the best, it is not amisse to set downe the same.
                  The best Opium is that which is very bitter, and so hot in tast that it wil almost scorch and inflame the mouth, it is in colour something yellowish or like to a Lyons skin, and being formed into a lumpe, it seemes speckled as a masse of diuers colours, for in gathering the sayd Opium, the seeds are found clustered vpon the Poppie-heads, which being amassed cleaue together like a cake, its smell is fulsome and strong, and although it be accompted but of a cold temprature, yet it many times scaldeth the mouth.
                  
                     Opium is formed into cakes in the Country of Natolia, which exceed not aboue foure ounces or halfe a pound at the most, but the Merchants to make the greater profit by their sophistication double the aforesaid quantitie, for the subtill Venetians make the Cakes in their shops to weigh a pound at least, and this is the report of Bellon concerning Opium.
                  
                  Now considering that in his time a man could hardly get any in Christendome that

were good, how should we finde any now adaies either in the Apothecaries or Druggests shops which hath these tokens, or is so effectuall or pretious in its operation, letting passe the seeds or graines as the onely difference in gathering.
                  It is called ordinarily Opium Thebaicum, in respect of the Prouince of Thebes where the best is made.
               
            
            
               CHAP. II. Of the assurance we haue that Opium may bee vsed, and taken crude or mixed in Medicines without any preiudice or indangering the Patients life at all.
               
                  A MAN shall find some Physitions now a daies who adhering too much a conscience to the opinion of olde Leeches (capitall enemies to Opium its vse) doe not onely beleeue it as an article of their Creed, that whatsoeuer any Author hath said in detraction and disgrace of Opium is an vndoubted truth: To whom I answere and say, that wee ought not to submit our selues to their iudgement altogether, nor to

beleeue the opinion or saying of any Physition, whether antient or moderne otherwise then daily obseruation of the vse of things & our Grandame experience confirme in our vnderstanding for truth: for seeing that the ancient Physitions, as well Grecians as Arabians, how great or learned soeuer they were esteemed, yet being all but imperfect men and subiect to errour, had their owne proper passions, and were full of contention and iealousie one against another, as wee are now adaies; whence it followes that wee ought not to receiue all their workes for gospell, without condition as aforesayd: for as for example Galen, Plinie, and others, put the world in feare and suspition of Opium, and contrariwise Oribasius, Diescorides and others commend it, and assure and affirme it to bee profitable and necessarie for the cure of many diseases: who then in this case can giue vs better knowledge and satisfaction of truth of these things then Experience her selfe? Now shee tells vs that a man may safely vse Opium inwardly in mens bodies, Oribasius therefore and Diescorides, haue spoken truly, whereas the errour and abuse of others is manifest: which howsoeuer it falls out, it hinders vs nothing at all to search

into these things, seeing that neither cause nor reason can preiudice or hinder the authoritie of daily experience.
               That the vse of Opium deserueth to be applauded of all Physitions, wee haue two principall and certaine assurances; whereof the former is not onely the certification of Peter Bellon aforesaid, but of a hundred honorable personages, who haue beene in Asia, and affirme that the Turkes eate thereof in great quantitie almost euery day ordinarily without any mischāce or hurt to their bodies at al, which may in part be a sufficient demonstration that Opium is not a thing so venemous and daungerous to the life of man, as some giue out and proclaime it to be.
               But heere some (to small purpose) may tell mee that the Turkes may easily digest Opium, how colde soeuer in regarde of the hot Clime they liue in, whereas the Christians dwelling vnder a colder in Europe can doe no such matter: to whom I aunswere, that if it were graunted that Opium were of such qualitie as aforesayd: yet whether a man could digest it or not, cannot bee Physicallie attributed to the temprature of the Climate, but rather to the strong constitution, or naturall vigour of the people; for

the Turkes being from their very cradle more grossely brought vp and sed then the Christians are ingenerall, become not only more able bodied and stronger thereby, but also more apt and able to eate and digest diuers things which the tender and nice Christians cannot iudure: and that the truth is so, Let vs but consider a little the difference of naturall toughnes and strength betweene a Christian Paysant or Carle here amongst vs, and a Gentleman or Citizen; do not we see (I pray you) that the Paysant can more easily indure a purgation made of White Hellebore, Tithymalls, Euphorbium or Colocynthis (which are accompted violent and venemous Medicines) then these tender sparkes aforesayd can brooke Rheubarbe, Mechoacan, Sena, Aloes or the Damaske rose.
               But why the Turkes deuoure Opium on this fashion, ought rather to be imputed vnto an ordinarie custome, and common vsage among them, then to any other cause whatsoeuer; euen as the Indians are accustomed to take Tobacco, which is a plant not onely Narcoticke and stupefactiue, but of a violent and extreame vomitiue quality also. Notwithstanding we see that Christians, all Europe ouer, by little and little haue brought themselues into such a custome and habit

thereunto, that they feele no alteration or preiudice at all (as they thinke) by the vse thereof.
               I make no question but a man might finde a number of people among Christians that if they cannot alreadie, could easily accustome themselues to eate Opium as familiarly, as they take Tobacco: although they could not vse 
                     •
                  t in such quantitie, nor so often in regard it is a pure essence and extract, which Nature hath seperated from its plant: For essentiall things are alwaies farre more effectuall then grosse bee, for confirmation whereof we neede not doubt, that if a man should separate the rosinous and sulphurous substance of Tobaccao, and bring it into such a consistence as Opium is, and afterwards giue it vnto such as vsually take Toba
                        •
                     co, they could not possibly indure the tenth part so much of this as of the leaues, as hath beene alreadie practised and tried.
               There be some Empericks (I know) which giue crude Opium to their Patiens in as great or greater quantitie at a time then Discorides hath limitted, and that without any great daunger or hazard of life at all, onely correcting it a little with the powder of Caraway-seed; and in case of necessitie I my selfe would not sticke, or make any scruple to

vse it, yea I durst, if neede were, take two or three graines thereof at a time my selfe; for although I neuer did eate thereof hitherto indeed, yet haue I often tasted the same, and also receiued great quantitie of the sulphurous vapours, both into my stomacke and head in time of the preparation thereof without any perceiuance, or the least touch of any offence in the world: neuerthelesse it is not my counsell that any Physition should vse it crude in this maner, seeing we haue Art and meanes to prepare it otherwise.
               The second assurance that wee haue concerning the vse of Opium, is in that wee finde and see that the most expert and wisest Physitions of olde, found it good, and therefore prescribed this Medicine as a principall ingredient, and as one of the most important bases in their chiefest compositions, Alexiteries, Diaphoretickes, Anodynes, Cordialls, which naturally resist the most grieuous and violent diseases that can any waies happen to humaine bodies, for which cause they vsually call them Opiate Confections, as that of their Tre

principall Medicines for these many hundred yeares and yet doe; for they are indeed the most pretious and necessarie compositions their ordinarie Apothecaries haue.
               The causes which moued Ancient Physitions to put Opium vnto the foresayd confections are not few, seeing that its properties are to asswage all inward paines, strengthē the passages & conduits which are open, loose, & disbanded: precipitate, disperse and consume these venemous vapours which are raised from one part to another: incrassat and thicken al subtill corros

               CHAP. III. Concerning the good and euill affects which Opium may produce in mens bodies.
               
                  THat Opium (as aforesaid) being wisely administred to the diseased, produceth in them many good effects, and contrariwise abused exciteth diuers dangerous and mortall accidents, is in no sort doubted among discreet Physitions; but touching the cause why Opium doth worke these effects in mens bodies is disputable: for most Physitions impute it to that extremitie of the fourth degree of coldnesse wherewith it is endowed, and for proofe and confirmation hereof they produce an argument drawne from the effects of its operation in this manner: Opium (say they) prouoketh a vigilant or watchfull man to sleepe, and incrasseth thin and subtill humours: vigilancie, then proceeding (for the most part) from a hot and drie cause with matter or without, and the dissolution also of the humours from the like distemprature, Opium therefore contrarying and impugning the causes of these effects must needes bee of the

qualitie aforesayd, and for the further confirmation hereof they alledge Galen, Plini

               But although I cannot like a cunning Logician, frame sophisticall Syllogismes, or giue such luster to my reasons, as many would doe, which take greater pleasure in the Flo

                     •
                   things, notwithstanding if it be lawfull for meere Naturalists in plaine and simple termes to discourse of such things, whereof they haue sufficient experience, I may (vnder correction of those which know these things better then my selfe) deliuer my opinion also.
               
                  Opium then is not such a colde thing as they would haue it, as I can proue both by reason and experience; by reason in regard it is not onely bitter, but inflaming and excoriatiue, which are euident tokens of its hot qualitie and complexion; for so the wisest Physitions in the world iudge of bitter things: and the light of Nature it selfe teacheth vs that none of the foure elements doe corrode, in
                     •
                  lame, or heate, but that of fire.

Againe, its nature is knowne by its colour, for being of a darkish yellow, when it is dryed and powdered, it must needs be hot, as Aloes and Myrrhe, and all things of like colour be, especially if they haue any bitter tast adioyned.
               By experience wee may well approue that Opium is not cold in two respects▪ first that when the Turkes eate thereof, they become cheerefull, couragious and fierce in warre, secondly that when one giueth two or three graines thereof to any sick person, and couer him warme in his bed, it will make him sweate more then any other Diaphoreticke, which operations can by no meanes proceed from any cold qualitie it hath.
               But if a man should obiect amongst both. these reasons, saying, first the Turkes being of a hot constitution, and liuing in a hot clime, become more faint-hearted and cowardlike then those of colder temperatures, and therefore Opium tempering that heate maketh him more frolicke and cheerefull accidentally; secondly, that if a man giue but a cup-full of cold water onely to a sicke man to drinke, it will questionlesse make him sweate &c. Whereunto I answere, that if the Turkes doe acquire force and courage by tempering their heate with cold things, they might very

well spare that great labour and toyle they take in sowing their Poppie, and gathering their Opium, seeing that spring and riuerwater might stand them in as great stead, being a cold liquor, and dispiercing it selfe into all parts of the body, as soone as it is drunke, but it is so farre short of Opium in quickening the spirits, and raysing the courage, that it worketh quite contrary effects.
               And whereas they affirme that a cup of water (which is apparantly cold) will cause any sicke person to sweate, I answere, that if it cause one that is in a Feuer, or pestred with some other hot disease to sweate, as many times it doth, it proceeds not from any Diaphoreticall or sweating qualitie, inherent in it, but commeth to passe rather, per antiperistasim, and accidentally, for like as water cast vpon a hot Anuile or burning stone, immediately rayseth vp vapours and fumes, 
                     •
                  uen so doth water giuen to such a bodie, which after condensation, nature either expelleth by vrine or sweate, nor hath it this operation in all diseases or tempratures, whence it is manifest that water naturally cannot procure sweate but by accident onely, as is said.
               Now let vs returne to their arguments,

which goe about to proue that Opium is cold in respect it prouoketh sleepe, thickneth the humours, and taken too liberally causeth daungerous Symptomes and doubtfull euents, which reasons (I affirme) are of no force in this behalfe, for first as Opium prouoketh sleepe to all those which are afflicted with hot diseases, so doth it also prouoke the same in all other causes without exception, yea although they bee of different qualities, as witn
                     •
                  sseth Auicen and others, who haue diligently noted the same: and as for the humours, Opium doth not onely incrafsate and thicken th
                     •
                  se which are of a hot qualitie, but those also which are coldest of all, as that white and christalline humour which floweth and distilleth from the braine vnto the other parts, whence it appeareth that a man cannot produce such a necessarie consequence of the operation of Opium, as those men goe about to doe, for it we were tyed of necessitie to adhere and stand to the sence of the former arguments, it would consequently follow that all colde things would procure sleepe to the diseased, where no other thing could effect the same: Item, that they onely appeased all inward grieses, incrassed euery humour, hot, cold or how s
                     •
                  btill socuer, and in briefe had the very same

vertues that Opium before is described to haue, whereas ou the contrarie part no hot things could effect the same; but experience proueth it farre otherwise, for if Quick-siluer, the Magisterie of Lead (compared to Saturne) Salt-peter, or Allome (salts of a cold temprature) or the water de Sper: Ran, which is thought to coagulate or congeale the bloud by its extreame frigidi
                     •
                  ie, if none of these (I fay) perform those effects which Opium doth, nor Ice nor Snow themselues rationally administred in neuer so large a dose, can procure sleepe, or cease paines, but rather for the most part cause more vehement fits. Yet I will not deny that cold things may sometimes, and vpon some occasions procure rest, though not alwaies when neede is, nor so surely at any time as Opium well prepared.
               And as for hot things, they are for the most part so farre from causing disquietnesse to mens bodies, or subtilizing grosse humours that quite contrary a man may finde many that will prouoke sleepe, and thicken subtill and virulent humours, rather and sooner then other of a colder qualitie, as we may plainely perceiue by Mirrhe, Aloes, Storax, Olibanum, Worme-wood, Betonie, Safran and such other, yea & Sulphur it self (the very fire

of nature) doth not onely prouoke sleepe in some reasonable measure, but doth also in such wise coagulate and condense the subtill and hot humours, that it auaileth much the Pthysicall in staying their defluxions, and it is a thing most manifest amongst Spagirists that Sulphur can coagulate water, wine or Aqua-vitae in such sort that a man may beate them to powder in a morter, and after reduce them to that naturall forme they were in before.
               I am not ignorant, that a man may tell mee that things of a cold or hot nature, doe worke diuersely in bodies according to the diuersitie of the subiect they light vpon, as the fire which hardneth clay, and softneth waxe, and so of cold things, in like manner that Opium being extreamely cold, by that extremitie worketh in bodies, where other things of an inferiour degree cannot in any wise; but neither of the two reasons reach to the deapth of our dispute, for first Opium (the subiect of our discourse) worketh not in mens bodies in this or that manner by election, according to the diuersitie of their tempratures and complexions, but doth indifferently prouoke sleepe, and causeth all paines to cease of what nature or qualitie soeuer as aforesaid.
               
                  Secondly, putting the case that Opium were the coldest thing in the world, yet that small Dose, which we commonly vse to giue at a time, cannot exceed the great frigiditie of those things afore-named in their larger Doses.
               
               Were it not a great absurditie, to beleeue that one graine or two of Opium were colder then a dragme of Allome, prepared or crude, or one scruple of the Magisterie of Lead, or an ounce of the water of the Sperm
                        •
                      of frogges, or two ounces of the water of Nymphaa, or as an ounce or two of Quick-siluer, which some haue vsed to giue against the wormes and other maladies, all which passe through the bodie as cold as any ice, and manifestly coole the mouth, and other conduits where they passe, which one small Dose of Opium cannot doe, but rather contrarily heateth both mouth and stomacke; whence you may gather that these reasons, and the like, are meere palliatiue and stuperficiall arguments, and fine gloses to entertaine long chat, rather then to proue any coldnesse in Opium.
               
               Now touching the Symptomes which Opium causeth being inordinately taken, Experience her selfe teacheth vs, that Aqua-vitae (which is of a hot and subtill essence) being

too abundantly ingurged, causeth semblable effects, for many being drunke with Aquavitae haue dyed, seased as it were with Stupiditie, priuation, of sense, Trembling, Lethargie; and indeed ended their liues in such manner, as if they had swallowed to much Opium, and became benummed and stiffe, as if they had died in the very yee and snow.
               
                  Wine it selfe also causeth diuers Symptomes of Opium in them which abuse it, as wee may plainely see by the lamentable examples vsed in diuers parts of the Papacie, where they commonly make those people drunke which are condemned to any violent death, of whom some goe singing, and some rayling thereunto, and others as dull and senselesse as bruit beasts, none of them hauing any vnderstanding or memorie of their iminent slaughter, and which is worse, haue no true feeling of their sinnes, nor solide iudgement or discretion to recommend themselues to the mercie of their Creator.
               Wine (as all Authors affirme, and Experience her selfe declareth) being abused, doth cause in processe of time Phrensie, Madnesse, Rage, Furie, Stupiditie, Lethargie, Palsi
                        •
                     
                   and other dangerous diseases, euen as Opium doth, and is notwithstanding an hot liquor, as all

the world knoweth. Wee may then conclude that Opium maketh not the Turkes fierce and couragious in warre, nor maketh the diseased to sleepe, nor appeaseth all inward griefes of the bodie, because of its cold qualitie, or by reason of its heate (although it manifestly appeare to be hot) but in regard of his operations, which doubtlesse proceedeth from a specificall and hidden proprietie wherewith it is indowed, euen as wee see in deiectorie Physicke, which purgeth neither by reason of any heate or coldnesse therein, but rather by a certaine specificall qualitie as is sayd.
               Now as purgatiue Medicines rightly vsed, doe not onely euacuate Natures excrements, and bring the bodie to an excellent temprature, but being abused doe mightily offend and bring dissolution to the same; euen so Opium well administred, endoweth the bodie with singular benefits, but abused and vntemperatly giuen, worketh the contrary, whence it followeth that in the vsage of either of them, it behoueth the Physiti

                  HAuing generally declared the opinion of ancient Physitions concerning the nature, vertue and vse of Opium, and the controuersies which are among moderne Physitions touching the qualitie thereof, it is not amisse to see now what Theophrastus Paracelsus (that great searcher and diuer into nature) saith in this behalfe.

               That Theophrastus doth also commend the vsage of Opium among his Anodynes, and Somniferous Medicines, it may easily appeare in the forenamed Chapter De Specifico Anod. wherein hee proposeth Opium onely without addition of other Somniferous things, to make that composition which he calleth his Anodynum Specificum, and attributeth vnto it this excellent proprietie, saying, that it causeth not the whole body of man to sleepe, but the diseases onely. In his booke De Morbis amentium, where he writeth of those that be Mad, Lunaticke, Phrantick, Epilepticke, &c. hee putteth the quintessence of

                  Opium in the ranke before Aurum Potabile, Argentum Potabile, the Magisterie of Pearles, and all other pretious Medicines which bee ordained for these maladies.

in some conuenient liquor, whereby the essense or tincture thereof may be extracted, to which purpose he taketh the spirit of Vitrioll (composed against the Epilepsie) as a specificall furtherer in this case.
               
               The second meanes, is to take Opium, and to cut it into small slices, and to put it into 
                     •
                  a cleane Frying-pan, or vpon a Lamine or broad plate of yron, and with a gentle fire euaporate away its Sulphur, which will exhale or fume away like a grosse and stinking smoake, from which smell it is no
                     •
                   amisse to abstaine as much as may bee: some in the interim sprinkle it with a little rose Vinegar, and stirre it together with a Spatula or slice as it melteth like Aloes, and after spread it abroad vpon the sayd Lamine of yron, and so let it euapour away as long as any fume will arise, and vntill it become so drie that it may be powdred, alwaies bewaring that it burne not.
               This manner of preparation is approued for good of Quercetane, and many other moderne Physitions, and I my selfe also alwaies obserue the same methode when I haue occasion to make any Laudanum for mine owne vse.
               The third way is to dissolue the crude Opium in some conuenient liquor (as is sayd)

and letting it digest and boyle easily, still scumming away the froath, and vnctuous Cremor swimming aloft, which indeed is its sulphurous malignitie, and reserue the rest for vse.
               This manner of preparation is highly commended of Crollius in his Basilica Chymica, in the Chapter intreating of Laudanum.
               
               Of these three maners of preparing Opium before it be brought to an extract, let euery Physition make his owne choice.

                  ce or (as some call it the substance of Opium) is to be extracted, wherein his manifold vertues consist, and how to depriue or take away his maligne acrimony.
               
                  THE tincture of Opium (purified from its sulphurous malignitie as before) is ordinarily extracted with Aquavitae rectified, or else with Vineger, iuice of Citrons, Oranges, Quinces or other egar and tart liquors, but of all these I make continuall choice of Vinegar, for egar

things generally haue a naturall proprietie to correct all venemous things, and to qualifie and mitigate all those which haue any great Acrimonie, or any Causticke or aduring facultie, which a man cannot find that Aquavitae can by any meanes doe, and this is the reason that the most sage and auncien

                   Physitions haue ordained that Scammonie

                  Vinegar and other sower and tart things are of such high esteeme among Physitions, that (in a maner) no man doth administer either Bezoar-stone, Vnicornes-horne, Terralemnia, Treakle, or any other preseruatiue to any sicke person, vnlesse they be mi
                     •
                  ed with

                  Oximel-simplex, Syrupe of Quinces, iuice of Citrons, Pomgranates, Berberies, Sorrell or some other tart liquor; the which thing they doe not without great reason, considering that egar things ingenerall comfort the stomack, resist poysons, qualifie inward heates, and defend the parts from corruption; the which thing indeed Vinegar doth aboue all other vegetable things whatsoeuer, as may plainly appeare by its safe conseruation of all things from any corruption that are put therein, which neither the iuice of Citrons, Oranges, Pomgranates, nor any other thing can doe, vnlesse a man couer them with oyle and keepe them close from the ayre; and for my part I haue made sufficient experiment that the essence of Opium extracted with Vinegar is of greater efficacie, and more confortatiue then that which is drawne with Aqua-vitae, which liquor notwithstanding I mesprise not in regard it is a subtill and very excellent essence seruing many Medicinall operations, yet in this particular I doe in no wise approue or allow thereof, for many reasons which euery discreet Physition can manifestly yeeld.
               The meanes then to extract the Tincture of Opium (after it is prepared and powdered as aforesayd) is to put the same into a conuenient

glasse bodie hauing a strait or narrow mouth, and that for euery ounce of Opium you poure ther
                     •
                  unto eight ounces of liquor at the least, be it Aqua-vitae, Vinegar or what other things soeuer the Physition pleaseth, and being well and close luted or stopped, let it be put in B. M. or set in the Sunne, or by a furnace, or neere the fire-side where it may remaine warme in digestion for the space of thirtie or fortie daies together, for by that meanes the Opium will begin to alter & change its acrimonious churlishnesse altogether; for this maner of digestion doth much resemble the Suns operation, in concocting & ripening tart and crude things, & changing thē into a sweet, pleasant & delectable tast, as nature hath manifested by the example of Figs, which at first haue such a corrasiue and causticke kind of Milkinesse in them, which (as soone as it but toucheth any part of the body) rayseth pustules and blisters thereupon; which milkinesse notwithstanding is afterward conuerted by the Sunnes-heate into a delicate and sweet iuice.
               Hauing thus accomplished the digestion of the Opium, his subtil part is easily separated from the grosse by inclination or filtring; And his essence is afterwards easily

brought into a required and due consistence by euaporation in B.M. and so may be well reserued for vse, as shalbe declared hereafter.

                  Aduertisments.
                  1 My meaning is that Opium should bee first freed and quit from his sulphurous Malignity, by meanes of its exsicration aforesayd, and afterwards digested for the space of a moneth in distilled Vinegar, wherein good stoare of white Saunders, Balme, Redroses

roses and Cinamon haue beene infused, and lastly brought vnto the consistence of liquid Pitch, or somewhat thicker.
                  2 For Bezoar-Regall, I meane fine Gold, reduced into the forme of powder, by the Phylosophers dissoluing balsame, and so brought vnto such a true, reall, comfortable, and Bezoardick Medicine, that one graine thereof shall farre exceed six, or eight graines of the best orientall Bezoar; which (if need be) is very demonstrable.
                  3 That the (Saffron being pure and neate.) be infused after Quercetans-maner in Limon-water, and so the tincture drawne, let the water bee euapored with an easie and gentle fire, lest the more excellent and subtill spirit of the Saffron flie away.
                  4 To conclude, I put no Magistery or tincture of Pearle, Pretious-stones, Corall, nor of any other Cordiall things in my Laudanum then you see, not onely because I find the foresayd tincture of Gold to bee as sufficient and auaileable as all the rest, but for some other rationall considerations, which here I spare to speake of.
                  5 And for the Amber-grise put therein, I neuer knew any woman troubled with the suffocation of the Mother, feele any manifest nuisance, alteration or offence thereby,

                  The properties of euery Laudanum, which is well prepared and corrected, as beforesayd, are principally sixe.
                  1 The first is to giue ease, or to cease all inward paines proceeding of what cause soeuer, and that at all times, and to all persons without exception of what complexion, temprature, age, or constit

                     e.
                  2 To prouoke those to sleepe which are

destitute thereof by reason of any corporall disease, or alteration of spirit, which things it effecteth without dulling or benumming the senses, weakning the members, constipating the bodie, or producing any euill accidents at all in them, as other Somniferous things doe which are naturally cold, and il prepared.
                  3 To stop all vehement, subtill and corroding Cathurrous distillations falling from the braine vpon the lower parts, thickening them by little and little, strenthening the braine, and repressing the grosse vapors which rise from the stomacke vpwards, which are ordinarily the causes of such defluxions.
                  4 To stay naturally the Haemorrhagie, dyssenterie and menstruall fluxes, as also the Dyarrhaea and fluxe of the belly, proceeding frō the great distemprature of inward heate, or some sharpe and biting humour.
                  5 To consummate and cease all burning Feuers and praeternaturall heate, proceeding from any wound or vlcer, or frō the fermentation or ripening of any cholerick humor, or any causticke or venemous matter.
                  6 To roborate and strengthen the bowels and all the relaxed and feeble conduits, and those whose vertue retentiue is weakened, by reason of some long sicknesse, or by the too much vse of purgatiue medicines.
               
               
                  
                  
                     Laudanum is more particularly vsed with good successe in these diseases following.
                  1 Against all maner of head-ach, as inueterate Megrims, Cephalalgia, or any other kind of excessiue paine, hauing regard that the stomacke bee first clensed from all grosse and corrupt humours, the Dose is one small Pill to bee taken at bed-time, some two houres after supper, either in the water or syrrup of sweet Maioran, B
                           •
                        tony, or some other Cephalick liquor, as the Physitions shall thinke good: or otherwise a man may take it in ale or broth, or swallow it dry as it is, continuing the same as long as need shall require, that is vntill the paine be so tamed, that Laudanum is needlesse, which order must be obserued in all other diseases, wherein it is vsed.
                  2 Against all subtill Catarrhons, Destillations which fall from the braine vnto the eyes, teeth, or eares, or vpon the inferiour parts, as the lungs, brest, stomack, &c. wherein Laudanum is vsed, as aforesaid, keeping the Patients head in the meane time neither too hot, nor too cold, nor suffering him to drink any wine, stale beere, or other strong drinke, as also to forbeare eating of mustard, garlick, onions, all spices and other things of a hot

and drie qualitie, which further and prouoke too much the foresaid distillation. If it bee conuenient to open the body you must vse no other purgatiue then that of Aloes, washed in rose-water, and thickned with the iuice of Rheubarb, Manna, Syrrupe of Roses, or with a conuenient Clister, which indeed is much better, for all other kind of purgatiue, dry and attractiue medicines are very dangerous in such accidents.
                  3 Against all paines of the eares with noise and flatulent tingling, be it by reason of certaine wind inclosed in the braine, or of any other vapours arising from the stomack: this medicine is best taken in the water of Fennel, Sage or a little white wine going to bed as aforesayd.
                  4 Against the ayrie Epilepsie (I speake vnto Naturalists) whose sits happen with great ebullition of bloud, and afflict the Patient with an Haemorrhagic and great head-ach, we vse to giue Laudanum in the water of Paeonie, wild Poppy or other appropriat liquor before or after the fit, and this must be giuen once euery quarter of the Moone in the morning before Sun-rise, causing the patient to keepe a good diet, and to bee let bloud in due season and oportunity.
                  5 Against tooth-ach caused through any

hot and subtill destillation, we vse to dissolue a little Laudanum in Vinegar, a few drops whereof the sicke patient must take and hold in his mouth a while, and after spit it out, and so take more and more in that fashion, vntill the paine cease.
                  7 To those which cannot sleepe by any means, we commonly giue a little La
                           •
                        danum with a spoon-ful of the water of Hypericon or Balme, some twice or thrice a weeke, as long as need shall require.
                  7 To those which haue any great fluxe of bloud at the nose, or mouth, after due inquisition of the precedent cause, to the end Phlebotomie, Cupping-glasses, or other means for revulsion-sake may be vsed, which taking no effect, we should instantly giue the patient a little Laudanum in the water of Plaintaine, bursa pastoris Tormentill, or rather (as most effectuall) in Aqua spermatis ranarum per descensum distillat. And if the bloud issue from the nose, we put a little lint therein, that is soaked in the sayd water and Laudanum mixed, and also apply some dipped therein to the fore-head, by meanes whereof the flux will immediatly stay: But if the partie hath bled much alreadie, vse no more Phlebotomie, but presently haue recourse to this remedie.
                  8 To those which are subiect to too much

vomiting and cannot brooke any meat on their stomack, by reason of some offensive matter there heaped & congealed, it is necessary that expulsion of the aforesaid matter be first made by the fittest Emunctory, either vpward or downward, as occasion shal require; or if the vomiting proceed through the abudance of wind, or vapors inclosed in the bowels by reason of some obstruction in the reins (as often it falleth out) or of some other part in such case these obstructions should be opened with some good Diureticke, Diaphoretick & other conuenient medicines, otherwise if the vomiting proceed from the particular debility of the stomack, f
                        •
                     ō some vlcer, or any other cause then those aforenamed: In such case a man may administer Laudanum in the Syrrup of Quinces or Betony, reiterating the same as often as need shall require.
                  9 Against burning, malignant and pestilent Feuers (after conuenient vse of vomits, Bezoardicks and other remedies fit to euacuate grosse humors, or purifie the bloud, if it be needfull) a man may giue the Patient Laudanū
                      in the water of Carduus-be

                        •
                     like, for in such cases it doth precipitate and consume the venemous vapors which arise frō the center of the body to the braine, causing madnesse, rage, phrensey,

and diuers other dangerous accidents, which by this means may be preuented, for it asswageth the extreame heat in Feuers, comforteth the body and recreateth the spirits.
                  10 In intermitting Feuers after due euacuation of the offending and grosse humors, by vomit or siege appropriate, and the subtil and thin by conuen

                  11 Against the Collicke, and all griping in the bellie (hauing regard that the bodie be alwaies kept soluble by some Clyster or Laxatiue Medicine, we commonly giue Laudanum in a spoone-full of good

white-wine; but the paine falling out too violent and intellerable we stay for no other remedies, but vse this at the very beginning, and the griefe being ceased, the Physition may happily proceed in his cure by remouing the offending cause, otherwise if hee shall see occasion.
                  12 In extreame paines and pinches which proceed from the small guts called Iliaca p
                           •

                           •
                        , we administer Laudanum in the oyle of sweet Almonds, or Muscilage of Quince-seed.
                  13 Against paines of the Matrix, we giue Landanum in the water of Chamomill or Mugwort, but if the paines doe particularly proceed from retention of the menstrues, then must the cause bee taken away by prouoking them with conuenient medicines, neuerthelesse the griefe being intollerable, Laudanum may be first vsed, for it ceaseth all paines, represseth and consumeth all noysome vapours, which mount to the braine, and afflict women with priuation of Sense, Strangulation, Epileptick fits, &c. without feare of any preiudice, by neglecting the cause, which the Physition may better meddle withall when the Symptomes are staied.
                  14 When a woman is deliuered from Child-birth, and her paines fall out afterwards to bee insupportable, causing want of

Sleepe, Sounding, a burning Feuer, and great debilitie. In such a case Laudanum is found to be the most soueraigne remedie that can be, and hath no lesse vertue in the restrayning the too much effusion of bloud after birth, by giuing only one small Pill as aforesaid.
                  15 In all dangerous Fluxions of the Menstrues, wee vse to giue Laudanum twice or thrice, or as need shall require, and it will doubtlesse stay them, so that the Patient vse a conuenient diet and rest, and refraine from anger and other violent passions, altering and troubling the bloud, I haue cured diuers that haue lost (in a maner) all the bloud in their bodies, by giuing them onely Laudanum, and after taking a course to restore nature with conuenient Viands, and to comfort the heart, cause them to take the Magisterie of Pearle, Corall, the Cordiall Elixer, commonly called the Philosophers Aurum Potabile, &c.
                  
                  16 In Dysenteries, and also in great 
                        •

                     er, & the part affected, we vse Laudanum with the Syrtupe of Quinces, once, twice or thrice, as need shall require, omitting in no wise expedient Phlebotomie, or any other outward meanes, whether

they be Vnguents, Plasters, or whatsoeuer.
                  17 To those which (hauing taken some naughty purgation) are fallen into a violent fluxe of the belly with no little danger of life (as by many examples is apparant) we giue Laudanum in a spoone-full of Red-wine once, twice, &c. vntill the fluxe cease.
                  18 In exceeding griefe in the Reines (called Nephritis) as also when the vrine destilleth by drops, scalding and corroding the vrinarie passages, much like to a strong-lee, Laudanū
                      is giuen mixed with a little conserue of Roses, or with some Syrrupe of Violets.
                  19 Laudanum is likewise giuen to those which are daungerously afflicted with the stone, after the giuing of a mollifyng & carminatiue Clister, if the body be bound, and then it is best exhibited in Meath, or the Syrrupe of Liquirise.
                  20 To those which are exceedingly pained by reason of some inward rupture, Laudanum is vsually giuen in a spoone-full of good wine, annoynting them outwardly with a little oyle of Nut-megs, and causing them in the meane time to keepe themselues very warme.
                  21 Against all Gouts, or paines in the ioynts, whether it bee in the Feet, Hands,

Knees, Hippes, &c. coniunct with inflammation, and when the offending matter is windie and vnconstant shifting from one place vnto another, in such cases to ease the paine, digest the matter, and thicken it so that it may bee more easily expelled by purgatiue meanes, or that Nature-selfe may consume it by insensible transpiration)

                     me then good by sturring the humour ouer much, and causing inanition of the parts when the inflammation growes more vehement, and the sicke persons farre worse afflicted then before. To Arthriticall persons, in whom the offending matter is not so vagant, but constant and resident in one place, who suffer not onely great paine, but an extreame Feuer with debilitation, losse of naturall rest and such like cases and Symptones, Laudanum is verie conuenient at the instant to stay the violence, after which you may vse purgatiue medicines to take away

the cause with farre better successe then before, for if you should tamper and purge during these fits you would raise sundry others of greater danger, for such strong purgations as those which are able to exhale the offending matter from the ioynts, would bee vsed when nature is quiet, rather then at such times as she is vexed, deiected & cast downe through violent paines and griefe.
                  22 To a wounded person, which is assaulted with a burning Feuer, Inquietude, Haemorrhagia, or some other accident, whereby the wound is incensed and in danger to gangrene: in such a case that Chyrurgian is worthie double honour, who knowes well how to vse Laudanum, for the good successe which vndoubtedly followes.
                  23 If any person afflicted with intollerable great paine by reason of any in

I had once in Switzerland a certaine patient about 90. years of age in cure, who had two great vlcers, which in 15. yeares did so torment him, that he could take no rest, night nor day, so that he was constrained to seeke about for some man to giue him case; to whom hauing but

begun to administer a little Laudanum, hee immediatly recouered his naturall rest, and shortly after was able to walke all the towne ouer, the which he could not do of long time before, so that onely by means of Laudanum hee preserued himselfe for the space of one yeare and a halfe together, at the end whereof hee died for very age, the vlcers in the meane time, neate, cleane and open, and that without application of any other outward thing more then a linnen ragge dipped in the water of Spotted Pers

                  24 Lastly when any person is tormented with any malady whatsoeuer, and hauing tryed all ordinary remedies that can be deuised to take away the cause, and being not able to be holpen therby, but remain in continual torments, Dolor, Vexation & Watching, whereby the Radical moysture is so dainly exhausted, naturall heate extinguished, &c. In this case Laudanum doth merit to bee called the onely soueraigne salue for languishing people, seeing it ceaseth all their griefe strengthneth their inward parts, maintaineth naturall heate, and produceth such miracles in nature, that none can imagine, but such as haue experience of the same, for I haue obserued many examples very remarkeable, as

that hauing my selfe, with good discretion and aduice administred Laudanum to some persons, when they haue beene struggeling with death, and assaulted with intollerable Agonies, Paine and torments, they haue had such comfort and ease, that presently after they haue in farre better sense recommended themselues vnto God, giuen order concerning their worldly estate, and yeelded their spirits into the hand of their Maker with quietnesse, great comfort and edification of all them that were present about them; But the contrary hath often fallen out and still doth for want of such a Medicine, in whose stead there can be found no parrallel, as experience doth plainely declare, which ought to moue and stirre vp euery Physition, which neither knowes how to procure nor vse the same to acquit himselfe so much the more carefully of his charge before God and his neighbour, for there is no reason, particular opinion, nor any disputation ought to preuaile against charitie, by meanes whereof the whole vniuerse doth stand and continue, and whereupon all good Arts and Sciences are founded, so that wee halt in our dutie, when we neglect to search out and procure such things as are wholesome, good, and comfortable to sicke people, albeit they were inuented

and found out by Pagans or Christians, ancient or moderne, Gallen or Paracelsus or any other Author, whose opiniō we hold for Oracles, we cānot render ourselues excusable before God the very searcher of the heart and thoughts: for experience being the great fundamentall booke of Physitions, which is daily read vnto vs by the light of nature, we should continually indeuour our selues, not only to vnderstand but obserue, also her mo

                  4 To Asthmaticall people, whose Brests, Lungs and other Organes are stuffed with Viscous and clammy flegme, you must take heed of giuing any Laudanum, for in such cases you must vse Medicines to dissolue and clense away the said matter, which Laudanum cannot do being a medicine of a corroborating and indifferent thickning nature:
                  
                     5 Laudanum is not good or conuenient for Hydropical persons, which for the abundance of water conteined in them haue much adoe to breath and dare not sleepe in their beds for feare of suffocation, yet after the watrie matter is euacuated, the Liuer and other parts vnstopped with conuenient medicines, and deliuer

                     uxions and finish the whole cure.
                  6 Finally, Laudaunum is not conuenient for them, whose stomack is full of grosse humours which should bee euacuated with vomitory or Cathariticke medicines, nor for those which haue the Small-pocks, which Symptomes should bee taken away with appropriat remedies: In briefe, no man ought to vndertake the cure of any disease with Laudanum, which hath need of mitigation or helpe, either by Vomitories, Cathartickes, Diaphoretickes, Diuretickes, Alexitaries, Vulneraries, Phlebotomie, Diet, or any other appropriat remedie: And contrariwise it is idle to goe about to cure any disease with an other medicine, which of necessity must be cured with Laudanum: for euerie medicinall rule, and euerie Section of medicines haue vnder

them their proper maladies for whose cure they are especially appropriated, yet notwithstanding wee are constrained many times vpon occasion to mixe one thing with another, not only in regard that two or three diseases do often iump together in one body, but also for the varietie of Symptomes, and effects that one only diseases may sometimes produce, so that one while one Medicine, another while another may be found to be most conuenient, and agreeable. And this is the reason why I propose not Laudanum for a vniuersall Medicine.
               
            
            
               CHAP. X. Confuting three erronious obiections which may be proposed against the vse of Laudanum.
               
               
                  SOme 8. yeares since, 
                     •
                  being in consultatiō with certain Physitions, about a man which was troubled with a fluxe of the belly a month together, & at that time together with the same had a continuall Feuer, was depriued of naturall rest and mightily tormented with belly-ach,

so that notwithstanding the vse of a great number of medicines, yet he was become exceeding weake and feeble: vpon which occasion when it came to my turne to s
                     •
                  eake, I proposed Laudanum, for an excellent medicine in that case: but they vtterly disl
                     •
                  king the same, came vpon me with these three obiections following, which notwithstanding were not able to renverse or ouerthrow my opinion. To preuent therefore a mischiefe which may happen to some sicke persons for want of Laudanum, being denied the vse thereof vpon so slight reasons, I thought good for conclusion of this Treatise, to set downe their obiections and my refutation of them in manner as followeth.
               
                  The Obiections.
                  1 First that Laudanum, being principally composed of Opium, and still re
                        •
                     eyning its Somniferous propertie, might consequently suffocate naturall heate, and benum and stup
                        •
                     fie all the senses.
                  2 Seeing Laudanum doth incrassate & thicken the subtill humors, it followed that although it did cease paine for the time, yet afterwards it made the cause of the sicknesse malignant, fixed and incurable.
                  
                     3 That it hath beene obserued, that some sicke people haue died some few houres after the taking of Laudanū, inconsideration wherof we should abstaine from its vse altogether.
               
               
                  The Answere.
                  Concerning the first obiection, I am of opinion, that if such men as goe about to propose any such thing, would either giue place to the authority of great Physitions, or experience-self (both which assuring vs that c
                        •
                     ude Opium, taken in small quantity, neither suffocateth naturall hea
                        •
                     e, nor dulleth the senses, as hath beene already sufficiently proued in the beginning of this discourse) they would neither blame, nor so basely esteeme of it; but suppose that a very smal Dose of crude Opium did produce such effects, must it therefore doe the same when it is depriued of the superfluity of its narcotical Sulphur, his Acrimonie corrected, and after mixed with such Bezoardick and Cordiall things as aforesaid? No man of iudgement, or of any experience in the Mysteries of nature, can deny that Opiū
                      (the principall ingredience or Basis of Laudanum) being thus altered both in forme and substance, becōmeth likewise changed in its vertues and operations, and therefore can

with no reason censure so hardly thereof as when it is crude: And notwithstanding that Laudanū
                      doth prouoke the diseased to sleepe, yet daily experience teacheth vs that it doth not suffocate naturall heate, but rather preserue it when it is about to consume, and in danger to be suddainely extinct by reason of its violent motion, extreame paines, and extraordinary watching, whereby it is as rudely handled as a lampe or burning-torch is in a mightie tempest, which causeth a greater wasting of oyle, and losse of light then it would doe if it were defended from such an accident.
                  2 For the second obiection: Laudanum is so farre from aggrauating, impairing or making worse the causes of the disease by reason of its incrassating faculty, that quite contrary it prepareth some offending humours, and maketh them far more apt and easie to be expelled, as in the 21. passage before cōcerning Gouts we haue something declared; For is it not the consent and verdict of the best Physitions in the world, that the preparation of humors before purgation doth chiefly consist in two operations, that is in subtilizing and attenuating of those which are Viscouse thick and clammy, and incrassating and thickning indifferently those which are too

subtill, virulent, windy & vagant in the body? Now the greatest part of extreame paines and inward heates proceeding from some dissolued matter, that is either salt, sharpe or corroding, or from such as doth excoriate, inflame and alter the member affected, whereby malignant vapors arise, which passing vnto the adioyning parts, doe by consent produce sūdry tormēts, & many euil accidents as by experience is manifest: what better course can a man obserue, then by meanes of Laudanum to thicken and digest the sayd humors & sequestring & consuming the aforesayd vapours in such sort, that they can by no means exercise their cruelty as before? And in case of superfluity (if it be any waies requisite to be purged, a man may doe it afterwards farre more warily and safely then in the former estate: is not this represented to any mans vnderstanding, by sundry outward vlcers, which being inflamed and distilling from some subtill and corrosiue humour, cause great Pricking, Dolour and paines and oftentimes by consent a Feuer to the Patient, so that the true remedie in such a case to take away such accidents is some excellent Anodyne, which may mitigate and asswage that vnnaturall heate, and suddenly ripen and indifferently thicken the offending

humor which was so subtill and corrosiue, which being done, al other Symptomes cease whatsoeuer; Laudanum then (not onely producing these effects by its naturall propertie, but also mundifying, resisting putrifaction, and healing, and comforting the weakened parts as it were Balsame) may by good consequence take away or extinguish the cause of many euill Symptomes, rather then impaire and make them incureable: for although it doth moderately incrassate, yet notwithstanding it doth not coagulate the bloud, nor fixe the substances, which in their owne proper nature are liquid in stone, nor soder or glue the parts together as Gypsum doth, for which cause onely men should blame it in such maner as before.
                  3 Thirdly, we will not deny, but that some sick person may chance to die soone after the receipt of Laudanum, but that Lauda
                           •
                        um was the cause of their death, & that in regard therof its vse is vtterly to be abandoned and forsaken is the matter now in question.
                  First therefore it is very apparant by our former discourse, that Laudanum is not a thing of such a venemous quality, as will cause death to the receiuer, for albeit the obseruation be true that some haue died soone after the taking thereof, yet that ought not

to supersede all other reasons, attestations & experience concerning the good effects, and safe vse of Laudanum, for as it is an absurd and foolish thing for a man to say, 
                        •
                      did see certaine graines of Bezoar-stone, Vnicornes-horne, Pearles, or such like pretious Cordials giuen to a sicke person who died not long after, ergo, that was the cause of his death, and therf
                        •
                     re take heed of vsing any such thing hereafter: or I saw one giue a Clister to such a sicke person who died soone after, Ergo, Clisters are dangerous remedies, and ought not to be vsed, as many simple people are accustomed to argue; Euen so it is as absurd a thing to hold Laudanum in suspition, because such a one tooke it & after dy
                        •
                     d, for although it doe principally and speedily cause all torments to cease, and prouoke the diseased to sleepe, yet that is no consequence that it can preserue a man from death, when by God his secret decree his houre is come, for neither that nor no other Medicine in the world can doe: sleepe and exemption from paines are necessary things, as well for sound as sicke men, the one with distinction, the other without all exception; but that these two doe sometimes serue for the maintenance and strengthening of mans life, and other sometimes are vnnecessary, and of no vse, this proceeds

not through any fault in themselues, but in nature which doth not receiue them for her owne good and benefit, as other times she vseth to doe, which thing is liuely represented vnto vs by the vse of meate, drinke and all other things called Medicines not naturall, which sometimes are good and profitable to the bodie, and sometimes quite contrary, euen as nature disposeth of them for our good, or euill, howsoeuer in themselues they are alwaies good, seeing without thē no man can liue, we may easily perceiue the v
                        •
                     
                     ritie hereof by the example of any man, who hauing watched, and trauailed moderately vntill at last hee become drowsie and faint, who after a little sleepe, and repose being awakened, becommeth as liuely and frolicke as at first. But if this man returne to his labour, and redouble his paines & watching in such sort, that hee surpasse the limits of his strength, and so long vntill his vitall animall and naturall functions be vtterly disbanded and weakned, making such an exceeding alteration in his body and turning it quite vpside-downe, so that a dangerous and mortall disease insue: Now in this case, if he betake himselfe to this Medicine for rest and sleepe, thinking to finde like benefit and comfort, as before, he shalbe so farre from enioying

the same, that quite contrary he must needs pay the price of his life for his vaine excesse and intemperance. After the very same manner may wee iudge of such a sicke person as hath wanted sleepe beyond measure, indured intollerable paines, taken no food or nourishment, and become extreame weake and at point of death, who afterwards falling into a little sleepe of himselfe, or by meanes of a little Laudanum, or a spoone-full or two of some restauratiue liquor to comfort him; insteed of recouering his life by any of these, hee doubtlesse dies; the cause of his death notwithstanding ought not to bee imputed to the little sleepe hee had, nor to the taking of the Cordiall (seeing that sleepe and nourishment are two necessary things for the preseruation of life) but rather in regard that death hauing seized vpon them, these things could not produce those good effects, which by natures intention they were ordained and appointed for. Let this suffice then to confute the third obiection aforesaid, in defence of well prepared and discreetly administred Laudanum. For if any man vsing Opium as the Turkes doe, or Henbane, Mandrage, or any other Narcotiall thing so crude, raw,

il-prepared or vncorrected hath or doth cō
                     mit any notable error in that behalfe, it is farre from my scope or intention to defend any such abuse; my desire is rather that Physitions should beware how they deale with simple people, and lest the Art should bee slaundered, there ought to bee a fit time elected for the giuing of Laudanum, that is at the first incounter of the disease, when there is good hope of cure, considering that wee must not onely haue regard to purge Phlebomize, prescribe a Dyet, &c. to our Patients, but also to comfort and restore, to aduance and bring them to their naturall rest, and to cease and qualifie their torments. Moreouer wee should omit no occasion at any time, to ease and succour our neighbour, euen vntill the point of death, in all things wee may or can possibly, euen as, wee would bee serued our selues in the like 
                        •
                     ase, and that with all conuenient exceptions and protestation for the reason aforesayd; And this shall suffice for conclusion of this present Treatise.
                  Now I protest to euery one that shall read this same, that I haue no pretension in this discourse, to iniure, or detract from those which worthily make profession of Physick, but onely desire to amplifie the knowledge

of this medicine, for the benefit of such persons as are ignorant thereof, as I haue before sayd in my Preface. And also to manifest the paines which I take, and the diligence I bestow to find out the properties, preparation and true vse of such things as are especially conuenient and necessary in Physicke, and consequently to make it appeare, that those which (mooued with their owne proper passions) shall speake any thing against me, deceiue themselues, and derogate from that Noble name whence they are called Christians, thinking it no wrong to detract from anothers honour, so they may by that meanes or any other augment their owne, which I would haue construed with all modest exception, intending not to touch any one mans name more than another, if their owne tongues bee not their owne accusors, wherby if they chance to manifest themselues they shall haue no occasion to blame me, and therefore I commit my right to him which only knowes the hearts of men, and who administreth Iustice, Equity, Mercie and Grace, vnto all his Creatures, to whom bee glorie for euer and euer. Amen.
