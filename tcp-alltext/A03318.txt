dyſtylled Ca. iii.
               IT is nedefull with ſhorte cōcluſyō
to ſhewe the moſte expecte & comō
or lyghtyſt way of dyſtyllyng / to the entent
that the reder or lerner ſhold vnder
ſtande me without any murmuracyon or
longe reherſyng. Wherfore I haue two
maners of wayes wherin is cōprehēdyd
in brefe the ſhortyſt way of dyſtyllacion
¶The fyrſt is how it may be done in fyue
maner of wayes without any coſt.
               The ſecond waye with coſt onely of fyre
and that alſo in fyue maners
               ¶The fyrſt without coſt / is done thrugh
a threcorned fylte / named per filrri diſtillacionē
The ſecond maner of the fyrſte
way is this. A glas fylled vpon another
glas tourned with the bottom vpward / 
& well ſtopped / ſet or ſo hāgyd in the ſonne / 
is named per ſolis diſtillacionem
               The thyrde of the fyrſt waye is / A glas
fyllyd & well ſtoppyd wrought in dowgh
and ſo ſet in the ouen whan the brede is
baking / & is named ꝑ panis diſtillacionē
               
               The fourthe maner of the fyrſte waye
is / A glas the thyrde parte fyllyd / well
ſtoppyd / and buryed in horſe downge / &
is named / per fim
                     •
                   equi diſtillacionem.
               The fyfte maner of the fyrſte waye is
A glas fyllyd well ſtoppyd buryed in an
antehyll / named ꝑ formice diſtillacionē.
               ¶The fyrſte maner of the ſeconde waye
is of the dyſtyllynge with fyre / as thus.
A glas reaſonably fyllyd and ſet in water / 
vnder it a fyre made / & ther vpō an
helme or Alēbick ſet / named diſtillacio ꝑ
balneū marie or diſtillacio in duplovaſe
               The ſecond maner of the ſeconde way
is / ye ſhall put to the ſame water that
the glas ſtandeth in / horſe downge / thā
ſhall it be named / diſtillacio per ventrem
equinum.
               The thyrde maner of the ſecond way
is / Set your glas in a capell wher as
ſyfted aſſhes be in / named diſtillacio per
Sineres. The fourthe maner of the
ſeconde waye is / ye ſhall put ſande for aſſhes
in the capell where as the glas ſhall
ſtande in / & is called diſtillacio ꝑ arenam
               The fyfte maner of the ſeconde way
is / ye ſhall ſet boldely the glas vpō the
fyre / & nothyng betweyn the fyre and it
but onely an yron grate or an yron treuet / 
and is named diſtillacio per ignem.
               Thus yr haue the maners of the .ii.

is often marred and deſtroyed / be pendynge
therto of ſome maner of gowres.
ſuche lyke waters be rectyfyed thus. The

Alſo it fortuneth often tymes
whan two maner of waters be myxed to
