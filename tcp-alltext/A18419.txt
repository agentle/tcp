            Enter the count Laberuele in his shirt and night gowne, with two iewells in his hand.

This is the holy Greene my wifes close walke, to which not any but her selfe alone hath any key, onelye that I haue clapt her key in waxe, and made this counterfeite, to the which I steale aceesse, to work this rare & politike deuice: Faire is my wife and yong and delicate, although too re

               Exit.
            
            Enter Lemot and Colenet.
            
               Lemot.
               How like thou this morning Colenet? What, shall we haue a faire day?
            
            
               Colenet.
               The skie hangs full of humour, and I thinke we shall haue raine.
            
            
               Lem.
               Why raine is faire wether when the ground is dry and barren, especially when it raines humor, for then doe men like hot sparrowes and pigeons open all their wings ready to receiue them.
            
            
               Col.
               Why then we may chaunce to haue a faire day, for we shall spend it with so humorous acquaintance, as raines nothing but humor al their life time.
            
            
               Le.
               True Colenet, ouer which wil I sit like an old King in an old fashion play, hauing his wife, his counsel, his children, and his foole about him, to whome he will sit and point very learnedly as foloweth; my counsell graue, and you my noble peeres, my tender wife, and you my children deare, and thou my foole.

               Co.
               Yea sir, but what humor hath this gallant in his maner of taking acquaintance?

               Why this is excellent.
            
            
               Le.
               Nay sirra heres the iest of it, when hee is past this gratulation, he wil retire himself to a chimny, or a wal standing folding his armes thus: and go you and speake to him so farre as the roome you are in wil afford you, you shal neuer get him from that most gentlemanlike set, or behauior.

               This makes his humor persit, I would he would come once.

               Excuse me to the King, and tell him I will meet him there: so this is but the beginning of sport betweene this fine lord and his old lady: but this wench Martia hath happy starres raigned at the disposition of her beautie, for the King him selfe doth mightily dote on her. Now to my Puritane, and see if I can make vp my full proofe of her.

                   attyred, for that he would be pleased with meaner weed? besides I take no pleasure thus to please him: I am content, because it is my duty to keep to him, and not to seeke no further: but if that pleasure be a thing that makes the time seeme short, if it do laughter cause, if it procure the tongue but hartily to say, I thanke you, I haue no such thing, nor can the godliest woman in the worlde, against her nature please her sense, or soule, she may say, this I will, or this I will not. But what shall she reape hereby? comfort in an other world, if she will stay till then.

               Lab.
               Yea mary sir now I must looke about, now if her desolate proouer come againe, shal I admit him to make farther triall? Ile haue a Dialogue betweene my selfe and manly reason: to that speciall end reason, shall I indure a desolate man to come and court my wife, and proue her constancie: reason, to court and proue her you may beare my lord, for perfite things are not the worse for triall; gold will not turne to drosse for deepest triall: before God a comfortable saying; thanks gentle reason, Ile trouble you no more.

God saue sweet wife, looke vp, thy tempter comes.

               But if by frailtie you should yeeld in thought, what will you do?
            
            
               Flo.
               Then shall you keepe me close, and neuer let me see man but your selfe, if not, then boldly may I go abroade.

               Then to assure you if I yeelde or no, marke but these signes: as hee is proouing me, if I doe yeelde, you shall perceyue my face blush and looke pale, and put on heauie lookes. If I resist I will triumph, and smile, and when I hold but vp my finger, stop his vaine lips, or thrust him on the breast, then is he ouerthrowne both horse and foote.

               You see she dares put on this braue attire fit with the fashion, which you think serues much to lead a woman into light desires.

               My lord I see it: and the sight thereof doth halfe dismay me to make further proofe.
