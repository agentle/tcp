            Gathered in Engliſh verſe by Iohn Partridge, in the yere of our Lord. 1566.
            
               JMPRINTED at London, by Henrye Denham, for Thomas Hacket: and are to bée ſolde at his Shoppe in Lumbarde ſtreate.
         
         
            
            
            
               To the worshipfull Arthur Dwabene, Marchaunt venturer, his ſeruante and dayly oratour John Partridge wiſheth increaſe of worſhip, by his worthy trauayle.
            
               WHat tyme, right Worſhipfull, the moſte excellent Philoſopher of ye worlde, Democritus was demaunded of a frend, what was the chiefeſte beſte amongeſte men in all the worlde, verely (quoth he)

a pacient man in miſerie. The other replying, and demaunding the cauſe of that his aſſertion, he anſwered and ſayde: eyther he is not in miſerie at all, or elſe armed moſt ſtrongly and ſurely agaynſte all aduerſities what ſo euer they be, that ſhall happen vnto him. By pacience, ſayth he, of a thouſande euilles he is not at all any whit moleſted. Anaxagoras the Philoſopher, borne of a noble ſtocke, and ſonne to Eubullus, who in Philoſophie

dyd exceede, ſayeth that he himſelf could find nothing more excellent in war, than this one thing, that is, a Souldier to be hardy, and alſo chiefely aboue all other things, the ſame to be like wiſe truſtie and pacient to indure trauayle, payne, and other kind of miſeries that ſhall happen or befall vnto him in that conflicte of war in which he then is conuerſaunte. Alexander I meane the greate, hauing made war againſt the Perſians

and of thē had made gret ſlaughter, the king of Perſia being of a noble corage bolde, ſtoute, pacient and hardy, hauing taken a caſtle or hold for his defence, & beeing in tyme brought in ſubiection to the Macedonians, was demaunded of Alexander in what poynt he ſawe himſelfe not to be ouercome, to whome the King of Perſia anſwered on this wiſe: Sir king, in no point at all am I ouercome. Alexander hering him ſaye ſo, demaunded if he

had not loſt both friends, cūtries, caſtles, townes, & all thinges elſe, yes verily (quoth he) & yet am I not ouercōe: for though they al be gone, yet can I with pacience beare the loſſe of the ſame. Oh greate was the pacience of this King, yet verily nothing in compariſon of his, whome I haue taken to write vpon. Therefore I deeming nothing more fyt for a good nature than to ſet forth ſo notable a fact of pacience, as this was, haue at the

requeſt of a ſpeciall friend of mine, drawen the ſame though rudely yet hoping not without ſome profite, eyther of my ſelf, or of ſom other. And bicauſe that to euery caſtle, towne, citie, worke or workemanſhippe, there belongeth defence: and knowing that defence canne not be made wythout ſome one defender, I am ſo bolde (conſydering mine owne weakeneſſe) to dedicate this my ſimple worke vnto youre worſhip, that your wiſedome

may bee the defence thereof agaynſt the rancorous Zoilictes, whiche at all tymes from the beginning haue bene readie to breathe the fylth of their cancred ſtomackes vpon thoſe moſt famous works of the excellenteſt clearkes that euer were, whoſe bokes I am not worthye to beare, knowing likewyſe that if thoſe went not fre, mine can not. Therfore I hoping of your worſhips defence, am boldened the more in proſecuting of the

ſame. Thus truſting to your goodneſſe, I end, deſiring God to mayntayne your eſtate, and ſende you long life and good health, to his pleaſure and your heartes deſire.
            
               Your humble ſeruaunt,
Iohn Partridge.
            
         
         
            
            To the Reader.
            
               LEt pacience increaſe by kinde,
               within thy dolefull breaſt:
               Let that ſwete dame within thy bowre,
               haue hir abyding neaſt.
               Conſider, viewe and vnderſtande,
               what liquor doth deſcende:
               Out of hir welles, from perils great,
               the ſame will thée defende.
               The ſtinking bande of fowle diſpaire,
               thy ſtate ſhall not moleſt:
               Ne ſlaughter in thy gates ſhall not,
               to ſtrike be ready preſt.
               For Socrates doth playne declare,
               no other good to be:
               Than wrapt in woes and pinching cares,
               a pacient one to ſée.
               Thē ſaincts haue ſhewed what pacience is,
               howe precious in Gods ſight:
               In ſtories we may reade and finde,
               how much they did delight,
               For to be founde in miſeries,
               in pacience to dwell:
               Whereof to vs this ſtory doth
               moſt playnely ſhewe and tell.
               
                  
What pacience had Iob I finde,
               ſuch pacience is rare:
               A thouſand Martirs I with him,
               may very well compare.
               What was the pacience of thoſe,
               whome flaſhing firy flames:
               Bereft of life, yet coulde it not,
               at all extinct their fames.
               For fame ſor good deſert doth reſt,
               behinde though they be gone:
               Bicauſe we might purſue the like,
               and oft thinke thervpon.
               Therefore let vs purſue the ſame,
               and then we ſhal be ſure:
               For to poſſeſſe that glorious crowne,
               that laſtes and ſh
                     •
                  ll endure,
               After that earth, yea birdes and beaſtes,
               ſhall be conſumed to nought:
               Which crowne to vs O Lord do graunt,
               that with thy bloud vs bought.
            
         
         
            
            The verdicte of the Booke.
            
               LEarne here thou ſhalt one God moſt his
               To rule the heauens the earth and all:
               The Sunne, the Moone, the ſtarry Skie,
               Subiect to be vnto his call.
               Of pacience likewiſe reade thou ſhalt,
               Which is a gift of all moſt pure:
               Aboue the reſt I thée enſure.
            
            
               Gods prouidence here thou ſhalt knowe,
               His great good will I doe declare:
               His mighty force I playne doe ſhowe,
               Reade on therfore and doe not ſpare.
               Though that my ſkill be very bare,
               Yet fruite hereby well take you may:
               If it to reade you wil eſſay.
            
            
               In whome to put thy truſt be bolde,
               In whome to ioy here thou mayſt ſee:
               A treaſure paſſing any golde,
               Or precious ſtones what that they be.
               The ſame I doe declare to thée,
               To reade me therefore take ſome payne:
               And that I count my authors gayne.
               
                  
Farewell my friendes for for your ſakes,
               My author hath abrode me ſent:
               I paſſe not for all crabbed crakes,
               That Zoilus to make is bent.
               For all for you my author meant,
               When that in hand his pen he toke:
               And out this ſtorie firſt did loke.
            
            
               Patienter ferenda quae mutari non poſsunt
            
         
      
      
         
            
            
            
            The noble Hiſtory of Plaſidas.
            
               SOmetyme in Romane lande there was,
               a king of noble fame:
               Who was full faire in martiall feates,
               and Trayan had to name.
               Who vnder him of luſty Knightes,
               did keepe a comely trayne:
               And ouer them he poynted hath,
               one knight as Capitaine.
               This knight to name had Plaſidas,
               
               one whome the king did loue:
               For martiall feates that in this knight,
               did ſhine the reſt aboue.
               A wife he had of gliſtering hew,
               of ſhape both faire and trun:
               Of louing minde, of gladſome heart,
               and truſty vnto him.
               By her he had two children fayre,
               ſurmounting Phoebus bright:
               Who for their manly courage ſtone,
               compare with him they might.
               The prouerbe olde is verified,
               vpon theſe babies twaine:
               By ſplendent courage they aſſay,
               their honoures to maintaine.
               
                  
The father he before doth ſtriue,
               to runne a happy raſe:
               The manly children parent like,
               do followe on apace.
               And ſekes for to obtayne the crowne,
               of honour and of prayſe:
               Which to atchicue the noble hearts,
               indeuour ſtill alwayes.
               They ſpende their tyme with ioy and bleſſe
               their labour they imploy:
               According to their parentes mindes,
               their hope and perfect ioy.
               Such bookes theſe babes did learn to reade
               as preſent tyme did giue:
               Which might their tender yeares trade by
               in Mametrie to liue.
               Thus they in whom all tenderneſſe,
               of age did ſtill remaine:
               Were taught the labour tedious,
               of ſtudy to ſtuſtaine.
               The parentes eke imploy their dayes,
               good learning to attaine:
               And now and then they finde paſtime,
               their griefes for to reſtraine.
               
                  
Sometime on hunting he doth ride;
               ſometyme to Cheſſe they goe:
               Sometime great doutes they do decide,
               that in the Realme might growe.
               This was the vſe of Plaſidas,
               
               his minde to recreate:
               This vſed eke his children deare,
               O bleſſed happy fate.
               The ſtormy winter dayes hath left,
               with miſty cloudes to ſwell:
               And Phoebus bright appointed is,
               more nearer vs to dwell.
               And Eolus no pleaſure takes,
               to dim the ayre with cloudes:
               And Phoebus nowe is quite deudide,
               of fogges his beames that ſhrowdes.
               Then doth Aurora leaue the bed
               of Titan, and doth bring:
               Some ioyes to men, the wiſhed day
               beholding once to ſpring.
               And trées and hearbes with ioyfull heart,
               do ſhew their pleaſaunt hew:
               And Knights in Forreſts bende their force
               the Bucke for to ſubdew.
               
                  
Then Plaſidas with comely traine,
               of knightes of royall kinde:
               Do enter now the gréene Foreſtes,
               a Bucke foorth for to finde.
               At lēgth he came where bucks great ſtore,
               did ſtande confuſedly:
               And ech man now doth bend him ſelfe,
               his luſty Stede to try.
               Now here and there the harmeleſſe Buck,
               aſſayeth for to runne:
               And Plaſidas at one faire Bucke,
               to ryde he hath begonne.
               The other knightes amongſt the Buckes,
               in fieldes abrode do raunge:
               But Plaſidas followeth hard,
               this Bucke and will not chaunge.
               At length in thickſt of woods I ſay,
               the Bucke doth enter in:
               And then more fiercely hir to ſew,
               this knight doth ſtraight beginne.
               Till at the laſt the Bucke had tooke,
               a Mountaine huge and hye:
               And there the huge and lofty Bucke,
               
                  Plaſidas did diſcry.
               
                  
But as he was addicted ſore,
               the Bucke with force to take:
               The mighty God in Skyes aboue,
               his ſeruaunt did him make.
               And out from cloudes he called to him,
               his Idolles to deteſt:
               Which by and by fel in a ſwoune,
               and ſo he left the beaſt.
               Then there he layde his ſprangling corps,
               almoſt deuoyde of breath:
               I am thy God then ſayd the Lord,
               which bought thée with my death.
               My very bloud doth iuſtifie,
               in me thou haſt thy life:
               Go wende in haſt the Lorde can ſay,
               conuert thy Heathen wife.
               Thy children eke let them be taught,
               one God to honour pure:
               Then thou my kingdome ſhalt poſſeſſe,
               hereof thou mayſt be ſure.
               Where thou ſhalt liue eternally,
               if thou this life deteſt:
               And ſhalt if thou fight manfully,
               for aye with me be bleſt.
               
                  
Ariſe therfore go wende in haſt,
               this life is but as graſſe:
               To day full faire (hir gliſtring hew,)
               to morow quite is paſt.
               Thoſe ſtocks & ſtones the which thou doeſt
               as Coddes adorne with prayſe:
               Are in my ſight Idolatrous,
               therefore eſchewe thoſe wayes.
               Ariſe I ſay and get thée hence,
               make haſt thee to baptiſe:
               And ſée thou do conuert thy wife,
               I ſay in any wiſe.
               Apalled ſore with feare and dreade,
               the Knight ſtraight wayes did ſay:
               Haue mercy Lord, and me forgiue,
               I hartly do thée pray.
               Stand vp thou knight then ſayd the Lord,
               thy ſinnes remitted be:
               Do thou not feare for Sathan will,
               thee plague with miſery.
               Then downe he ſat with ſtretched handes
               to God he gaue the prayſe:
               And ſayde, to thee that ſittes on hye,
               be honour due alwayes.
               
                  
That haſt vouchſafe this day to call,
               thy ſeruaunt gone aſtray:
               Euen as a ſhéepe by fortune ſtrayed,
               out of the herde away.
               I do confeſſe thou onely arte,
               my comfort and my truſt:
               And eke my God, and thy promyſe,
               thou kepeſt true and luſt.
               No part thereof thou violateſt,
               thou art both God and man:
               Theſe ſtockes, theſe ſtones be Diuels yil,
               do vs no good they can.
               Thée therefore I do worſhip ſtill,
               thou madeſt the worlde of naught:
               And I the Image of thy grace,
               that thou of earth haſt wrought.
               I do confeſſe my heauenly king,
               that no good is in me:
               But that the goodneſſe which I haue,
               doth all diſcende from thee.
               Without thy grace and goodneſſe, I
               no day at all can ſay:
               But that I ſhould be ouerthrowen,
               and brought to deathes decay.
               
                  
But thou O God art my defence,
               my aide, my hope, and truſt:
               Thou art my king, my God, my Lord,
               my ſauiour true and iuſt.
               O Lord I know that Sathan will,
               with cares my ſoule moleſt:
               But thou O Lord in pacience,
               defende my carefull breſt.
               Let me with pacience ſtill abide,
               thy gracious layſure good:
               And graunt alſo to me full hope,
               in thy moſt precious bloud.
               That what ſo euer illes do hap,
               vnto thy ſeruaunt here:
               With willing minde the burden huge,
               with pacience I may bere.
               Graunt alſo that diſpayre do not,
               moleſt my quiet ſtate:
               Ne that I ſhould in any wiſe,
               incurre thy heauy hate.
               But giue me Lord a minde alwayes,
               obedient for to bée:
               Unto thy heſt, and to ſubmit
               my will alwayes to thée.
               
                  
So ſhall I be a moſt fitte braunch,
               ingraffed in the trée:
               Of liuing dayes, and at the laſt,
               ſhall euer raigne with thée.
               To whome be prayſe eternally,
               both now and euer more:
               One onely God though perſons thrée,
               as I haue ſayd before.
               Then at the laſt this noble knight,
               from Forreſt made returne:
               And thought within his hunting race,
               no longer to ſoiourne.
               But home he commes in poſting wiſe,
               The knightes they after hye:
               And ſome the chaſe will follow on,
               the ende thereof to trye.
               The mighty Buckes lye dead on launde.
               the Palfrayes they do ſweate:
               And from their frothy mouthes they breath
               the inward partching heate.
               Now here now there with launce in hand,
               the marſhall knightes do runne:
               And at the laſt they haue eſpyed,
               how Plaſidas did come.
               
                  
From out the groues ſo gréene which was
               beſet with many a trée:
               With heauy chere much like vnto,
               a man in miſerie.
               When they perceyued well that he,
               with ſorrow was infect:
               They muſed much, yet of that hapte,
               they nothing did ſuſpect.
               Then home they go and ſome doe lade,
               the pray that they haue ſlaine:
               And other ſome for their repaſtes,
               in Forceſtes do remaine.
               At length Plaſidas doth ariue,
               before his Caſtle gate:
               His wife to welcome home hir Loue,
               is ready ſone thereat.
               From gate to Hall they do aſcende,
               and there the bourdes be ſpred:
               The ſunne is downe, and time it is,
               for men to goe to bed.
               The chamberlaynes the bed downe lay,
               and fier in chamber make:
               And nowe Plaſidas he is come,
               his corporall reſt to take.
               
                  
When he in bed had layne a while,
               great griefes he did ſuſtayne:
               And ſe at length his minde to breake,
               he purpoſeth certaine.
               At length his wife perceyning that,
               no reſt her Mate could finde:
               She did procure him for to ſhewe,
               what dreade was in his minde.
               At length he ſayde, oh louing mate,
               the cauſe ſith thou wouldeſt know:
               Of theſe my cares ſo huge and fell,
               to thée them I will ſhowe.
               This day (quoth he) as I abrode
               in Forreſt thicke did runne:
               A mighty Burke his race to take,
               before me hath begunne.
               At whom I ſued with all my might,
               and force that I could make:
               At length the Bucke for his defence,
               the denſid woodes doth take.
               And there the Bucke I do purſue,
               on loftie ſtéede amaine:
               Till that the toppe of one great hill,
               he ſeketh to attaine.
               
                  
And there from out the ſkyes did breake,
               a voyce like thunders cry:
               For feare wherof almoſt my breath,
               to Skyes away did fly.
               Quoth he I am thy very God,
               ne made but being ſtill:
               Both heauen and earth, yea Skyes and al
               obeyes vnto my will.
               I made them all, and thée O man,
               as Lorde of earth to bée:
               The fiſhe, the foules, the birdes, the beaſt,
               ſhall all obey to thée.
               And for the loue which I thée bare,
               my Image I thée made:
               A liuing ſoule the life wherof,
               away ſhall neuer fade.
               Thus art thou now my Image pure,
               and I thy Lorde and king:
               Thou art the ſhepe whom I do loue,
               aboue all earthly thing.
               By this my loue I did declare,
               when thou waſt vtterly:
               Condemned for thy wickedneſſe,
               eternally to dye.
               
                  
I loued thée ſo that I did take,
               a ſeruaunts ſhape on me:
               For to be ſlaine euen as a ſhéepe,
               at Sacrifice we ſée.
               And thou vnkinde forgetting quite,
               what I for thée haue done:
               Haſt made thée Goddes, and of vile earth,
               a God is now become.
               Yet I bicauſe I tender thée,
               And rewe thy heauy fall:
               Uouchſafe againe thée to the folde,
               once more from ſinne to call.
               Repent therefore and learne to knowe,
               thy God, thy Lord, and King:
               So ſhalt thou with him eterne liue,
               where Angels holy ſing.
               Forſake thy Idolles and become,
               a Chriſtian now at laſt:
               And Ile remitte and quite forgiue,
               thy wickedneſſe forepaſte.
               Ariſe therefore go wende in haſt,
               make ſpeede for to conuert:
               Thy gentle wife, that honour ſhée,
               may me with all hir heart.
               
                  
O Lord (quoth I) if Sathan do,
               with care my corps moleſt:
               Be thou my ayde, let pacience ſtill,
               abide within my breſt.
               Do thou defende our ſinfull corps,
               O Lorde we thée deſire:
               That by thy death vnto the crowne
               of life we may aſſpire.
               Then ſayd the Lorde with troubles great,
               Sathan ſhall thee anoye:
               By fraude in frendſhip ſuch as erſt,
               with thée were wont to toye.
               And ſpeake thée faire, with cap and knée,
               at euery worde do make:
               Now in thy fall and miſerie,
               their flattering leaues ſhall take.
               And not content with rayling voice,
               reprochfull wordes to ſay:
               But eke are bent to ſpoyle thy Tent,
               thy goodes to beare away.
               Which thou ſhalt by my grace diuine,
               with pacience beare thy loſſe:
               And at the length when I ſée tune,
               Ile take away this croſſe.
               
                  
And will againe in former ſtate,
               thée place with ioy and bleſſe:
               With double folde, and ſhalt againe
               poſſeſſe thy loſt rycheſſe.
               Then downe I fell in ſwouning there,
               and loud and ſhirle I cryed:
               Oh Lord thy ſeruaunt will I be,
               hap me what will betide.
               Theſe were the wordes when ſacred tops,
               of mountaines great and tall:
               He left, O Plaſidas go home,
               thy wife ſée that thou call.
               Then ſayd his wife, my louing Lord,
               O Plaſidas ſo true:
               He is the God of heauen and earth,
               that did appeare to you.
               For yeſter night as I did lye,
               in bed with heauy minde:
               Me thought before me one moſt faire,
               in chamber I did finde.
               Appalled ſore twixt feare and dreade,
               at length to me he ſpake:
               And ſayd, O Theapis from ſlepe,
               and brouſineſſe awake.
               
                  
To morrow ſhall thy huſbande dere,
               what I am well perceaue:
               I am thy Chriſt and went his way,
               and thus he tooke his leaue.
               This for to ſhewe my louing Lord,
               I durſt no whit to thée:
               Leaſt happely thou mightſt haue thought,
               in me ſome iniury.
               But now I knowe and well perceyue,
               that that was Chriſt in deede:
               He is of God coequall mate,
               and eke of Dauids ſéede.
               To him therfore with thankes giuing,
               on Flutes and Pypes full ſhrill:
               Our Sacrifices vnto him,
               on Aultars will we kill.
               This is the Prophet which to vs,
               full long was prophecied:
               This is the very ſonne of him,
               who Starres in Skyes doth guide.
               Therefore my Lord if that thée pleaſe,
               of baptiſme let vs take:
               The ſacrament, and then let vs,
               our Country ſoyle forſake.
               
                  
Then ſayd the knight, faire dame at hand,
               doth reſt a clarke of fame:
               A Miniſter of ſacred rightes,
               who Buno hath to name.
               A comely man, of fayth moſt pure,
               to him ſtraight we will wende:
               For rightes of Baptiſme to receyue,
               I verily do pretend.
               Our children eke he baptiſe ſhall,
               according vnto right:
               And thus to him they went in haſt,
               in middeſt of the night.
               And when they baptiſme had receyued,
               as now the maner is:
               
                  Plaſidas, Euſtas had to name,
               his wiſe is Theapis.
               
               His children eke whom nature made,
               of beauty paſſing faire:
               Were tender ones, thone Agapite,
               
               
                  Theoſpite was the heyre.
               Thus baptiſme done vnto their houſe,
               agayne they do repaire:
               And there in peace a while they liue,
               both honeſtly and faire.
               
                  
At length the ſturdy boyſtrous blaſtes,
               of Sathan gins to rore:
               Euen as the water from a hyll,
               or as a myghty Bore.
               Which of ſome wight receyued hath,
               a wound both huge and great:
               Or as the flaſhing waues of floudes,
               that craggie rockes doth beate.
               With hurling here and there hir ſtreames,
               indeuoring for to weare:
               The ragged bankes which of their floudes,
               the crabbyd rage doth beare.
               Much like vnto a battayle made,
               a Citie for to get:
               And munition with burning ſtrokes,
               to ſacke the walles is ſet.
               And breach is made, and houſes burne,
               and ſouldiers nowe beginne:
               For ioy of ſpoyle, by vitall breath
               not for to ſet a pinne.
               Or elſe when as a Lion great,
               doth range with angry moode:
               With hungrie chawes amid the woods,
               doth ſéeke to haue his foode.
               
                  
And he that firſt within his ſight,
               appeares that he may ſée:
               With gaſping mouth on him he runnes,
               deuoured for to bée.
               So Sathan now in roring wiſe,
               on Plaſidas doth runne:
               His ſhéepe and cattell for to ſlay,
               already hath begunne.
               Then Plaſidas to pouertie,
               is brought the ready way:
               And eke when that his fayned friendes,
               perceyued his decay,
               They runne his houſe to ſpoyle and ſacke,
               his goodes they beare away:
               Euen thoſe whome he had feaſted earſt,
               before his great decay.
               Theſe pampered churles that ſit all day,
               at tables dayntie fed:
               Who by all miſchieuous crabbed guiles,
               with ſtinking heart is led.
               Whome neyther loue ne hate can driue,
               from out the Caſtell dore:
               They learned haue ſo for to rowe,
               with the Athenien oare.
               
                  
I may ſuch perſones well compare,
               vnto a pype or tonne:
               That hath good wine to outwarde ſight,
               in which there is poyſon.
               For they themſelues ſo beautifie,
               their wordes in inwarde ſhowe:
               But poyſon much is hyd therein,
               as afterwardes we knowe.
               Thus Plaſidas from great renoume,
               to pouertie is brought:
               And where he was a royall Knight,
               nowe is he worſe than nought.
               Thus then when ſhame had ouertoke,
               this worthy knight, then loe:
               In midſt of all the darkeſome night,
               from houſe and friends they goe.
               To water ſide, and there doe wayte,
               when lofty ſhip ſhall glyde:
               On foming ſeas, the winde is good,
               for them on ſeas to ryde.
               They do inquire if any ſhip,
               to countrey farre will wende:
               To whome the Maſter aunſwere made,
               that ſtraight they did intende,
               
                  
To hoyſe their ſayles and to departe,
               to Egipt in all haſt:
               Agreed they are, they hoyſe their ſayles,
               to ſayle away at laſt.
               The lande they leaue, into the déepe,
               they launce with winde at will:
               The mighty ſhippe the hollowe waues,
               at euery ſurge doth fill.
               The night is gone and day is come,
               wherein eche thing doth ioy:
               And here the luſty fiſh begin,
               at paynted pupe to toy.
               With fetching friſchoes here and there,
               with ſpready finne in ſea:
               And ſéemeth who faſteſt ſhould ſwimme,
               ſome wager for to lay.
               They ſayled haue and now at length,
               néere Egipt they ariue:
               The Maſter of the ſhip doth like,
               the beautie of the wife,
               Of Plaſidas, and doth delight,
               his wauering wanton minde:
               With rolling in his diue liſh brayne,
               the beautie of hir kinde.
               
                  
She pleaſed hath his lothfull eyes,
               with beauties ſhining beames:
               Fro whence ſometime did yſſue out,
               of teares abundant ſtreames.
               Then at the laſt when vnto land,
               they drewe, and playne did ſée:
               The touret tops, and knewe full well,
               how far from lande they be.
               The Maſter of the ſhip did ſay,
               you paſſangers we ſée:
               That nere to land our ſhip is come,
               therefore nowe ready be.
               For that you haue your fraught to pay,
               as due it is by right:
               Come on ſir boy, launce out this boate,
               the towne is here in ſight.
               The anker then through flaſhing floud,
               a way doth may doth make for holde:
               And there to ryde from daungers great,
               the Maſter is full bolde.
               The Maſter and the Mariners guide,
               the cocke boate vnto lande:
               Then he his fraight for to receiue,
               he ſtretcheth forth his hande.
               
                  
Yet nought at all from Plaſidas,
               
               might hap in any wayes:
               For all was gone, and naught was left,
               before he toke the ſeas.
               Why Plaſidas the Maſter ſayd,
               thy wife Ile haue away:
               If that thou wilt not out of hand,
               my duetie to me pay.
               Then out of hande he toke his wife,
               
                  Plaſidas being on ſhoare:
               And ſayd, ye friend thou ſhuldſt haue ſought
               thy frayght to pay before.
               Therefore I ſay thy wife with me,
               away from hence ſhall wende:
               With whome Plaſidas all in vayne,
               did labour and contende,
               To kepe hir ſtill, the Maſter ſtraight,
               his Mariners bad to bring:
               
                  Plaſidas loe in midſt of ſeas,
               by furious force to fling.
               So that his wife the Maſter he,
               at will might then poſſeſſe:
               His wilfulneſſe brought him his death,
               in thende as I doe geſſe,
               
                  
Well Plaſidas muſt needes departe,
               whether he will or nay:
               For money none at all he had,
               as then, the frayght to pay.
               But from the ſhoares of ſurging ſeas,
               with heauy minde doth wende:
               And for to liue in Egipt lande,
               he verily doth intende.
               With his two babes of tender yeares,
               ſo faire in natures grace:
               The one on fathers armes hanging,
               doth followe on a pace,
               The other he doth runne afore,
               with euery graſſe to play:
               His father mery for to make,
               all meanes he doth aſſay.
               At length wher flaſhing ſtreames of flouds,
               the ſhoares doth cleane deuide:
               They are ariued, and there they ſtande,
               the maner to decide,
               How for to paſſe thoſe troubleſome waues
               for néedes that way he muſt:
               Unto the towne, O Fortune thou
               to good men neuer iuſt,
               
                  
Who earſt a loft in chaire of ſtate,
               was wonte in peace to ſyt:
               Is now in floudes of miſerie,
               and thou not leauing it,
               Doeſt adde more care vnto his payne,
               thy faſhion it is ſo:
               Bycauſe thou wouldeſt that all men ſhuld
               take thée for friend nor foe.
               What mourning makes ye wight good lord
               whome wife is borne fro:
               And taking vp his yongeſt ſonne,
               from dolefull ſhoares doth go.
               To thother ſide where woodes and trées,
               on fertile ground doth ſtande:
               He is ariued, and there doth ſet,
               his tender childe on lande.
               And entring nowe the ruſhing waues,
               that ſoundes with noyſe ſo ſhrill:
               He doth approch the hollow waues,
               in myddeſt thereof to fill.
               When he in myddeſt was thereof,
               there came a Woulfe and tooke:
               The tender childe who late before,
               was borne ouer the brooke,
               
                  
And bare away, but God who made,
               the heauen, the earth and all:
               Did ſo prouide that once no hurt,
               vnto it ſhould befall.
               He ſéeing then his childe was gone,
               with dolefull minde he cride:
               Oh wicked wretch and miſer vile,
               what ſhall of me betide?
               And comming nowe to the other ſide,
               his eldeſt ſonne to catch:
               A Lion huge from wood doth come,
               and thother vp doth ſnatch.
               Which ſtraight doth trudge from thence away,
               vnto the wood agayne:
               A heauy ſight for Plaſidas,
               
               in this his dolefull payne.
               But Plaſidas pore ſoule doth ſtriue,
               his childe to get agayne:
               But he pore wretch of very truth,
               laboureth all in vayne.
               When that he ſawe no helpe there was,
               good Lorde he doth lament:
               But mighty God the childe to ſaue,
               hath reſcue ready ſent.
               
                  
The countrey men that were as then,
               a plowing in the fielde:
               The heard men eke that ſhéepe did kepe,
               did ſtand and all behelde.
               Where as a Lion huge did runne,
               and eke with him did beare:
               A manly childe, and loked as though,
               in pieces he would teare.
               Then out they ſent their hungry dogs,
               the Lion to ouertake.
               And ſo at length the Lion he,
               the childe did quite forſake.
               The Woulfe likewiſe to beare the childe,
               already hath begunne:
               Through mydſt of the plow men there,
               and they at him do runne
               With battes and ſtaues, the praye he left,
               and there the childe they founde:
               A comely wight, no hurt he had,
               But was both whole and ſounde.
               The plowe men and the heard men both,
               are ioyous of this thing:
               That chaunced hath, and to the towne,
               the children both they bring.
               
                  
There they declare how that they toke,
               theſe tender babes of age:
               From beaſts ful fierce, & how they brought
               them home to their village.
               Theſe men they were both of one towne,
               and ſet the babes to ſchole:
               To learne ſuch things as after they,
               thereby their life might rule.
               Nowe leaue we here a while and ſtay,
               and let vs furder heare:
               Of Plaſidas how he doth range,
               in dolefull heauy cheare.
               He paſſed is the watrie ſtreames,
               of that vnhappy ſhoare:
               With ſobbes and teares his cares & ſmart,
               increaſeth more and more.
               And then at laſt vpon the ground,
               proſtrate on face he lies:
               Haue mercy Lord on me vile wretch,
               continually he cries.
               Thou god that madeſt both heauen & erth,
               the ſea and eke eche thing:
               Which al the windes from out their caues,
               and hollowe rockes doſt bring.
               
                  
That madeſt the world and eke eche beaſt,
               that liueth now therein:
               Who makeſt pore, and eke doſt cauſe,
               of pore to ryſe a King.
               Who made the Sea, the fiſh, the foule,
               that flies vnder the Skies:
               Who rules the very iawes of beaſtes,
               in whome all force now lies.
               Who placed firſt the heauenly throne,
               of thy Gothead diuine:
               Who eke hath made within the world,
               both houres, dayes and time.
               Thou that didſt make the firmament,
               with Stars ſhining ſo bright:
               Thou that for day didſt make the Sunne,
               mens ſteps to guide aright.
               Thou that haſt made the planets ſeauen,
               in ſpheares to runne their race:
               Thou that next to the croked Moone,
               the burning flame doeſt place.
               And next to it a vacant place,
               where aire doth all abounde:
               The water eke which compaſſe doth,
               the heauy maſſiue grounde.
               
                  
That haſt to man ſuch power giuen,
               thy noble workes to knowe:
               And yet on him of thy good grace,
               doſt dayly more beſtowe.
               Graunt vnto me thy ſeruaunt here,
               one ſparke of thy good grace:
               That in this land I may now finde,
               ſome ioyfull reſting place.
               Euen I that wretch who is deuoyde,
               of wife and children twaine:
               Giue pacience Lord, to me pore wretch,
               though languiſhed in payne.
               Haue mercy on my children deare,
               where ſo their corps ſhall lie:
               Haue mercy on their parent eke,
               who liues in miſerie.
               This ſayde, vnto the towne he goeth,
               and ceaſſeth not to weepe:
               For children twaine, at laſt he commeth,
               in middeſt of the ſtreate.
               And there the men of that ſame towne,
               do Plaſidas deſire:
               To kepe their ſhéepe, and ſo he ſhould,
               of them receyue his hire.
               
                  
Agréed they are, and Plaſidas,
               
               his ſhéepe full well doth knowe:
               And now forthwith vnto the fieldes,
               his ſhéepe and he do goe.
               Now leaue we heare of Plaſidas,
               
               in ſhepheardes wéede for gayne:
               Sometime he was a noble Lorde,
               but now more pore certayne.
               But now we forth will ſhewe the meane,
               how God did all prouide:
               For mother and the children eke,
               as it may well be ſpide
               In ende, for loe, the fatall wretch,
               hath his rewarde with gayne:
               His great deſire was once the cauſe,
               why that his corps was ſlayne.
               For when on lofty roaring waues,
               he was with winde at will:
               He then in haſt would ſtrayght aſſay,
               his luſt for to fulfill.
               But as he would by force of armes,
               haue wrought the déedely acte:
               The mighty God with death repayde,
               this his purpoſed facte.
               
                  
And there in ſhippe all deade he lies,
               whoſe luſt did cauſe his woe:
               The mariners lament this caſe,
               and eke to lande they goe.
               With hir, on ſhoare to ſet, and eke
               more victuals for to buy:
               When winde is faire to cuntry ſoyle,
               agayne that they may hye.
               And much they prayſe hir conſtancie,
               hir beautie and hir grace:
               Hir faithfulneſſe vnto hir Loue,
               in this hir heauie caſe.
               The Lorde they praiſe and honor him,
               with all their might they haue:
               That ſo of his benignitie,
               his bleſſed flocke can ſaue.
               Then when to ſhore their boate was come,
               ſhe there hir leaue doth take:
               And willingly not with them any
               longer ſoiorne to make.
               Doth wende vnto a towne thereby,
               intending there to liue:
               Untill that God ſhall ſée his tyme,
               hir from hir cares to meue.
               
                  
Thus fiftene yeares all deſolate,
               ſhe liues in widdowes ray:
               Hir honeſt life not one there is,
               in all that towne that may
               Diſtaine. And loe it ſo befell,
               ſince Plaſidas was gone:
               That enimies the Romane lande,
               do vexe and warre vpon.
               At whome the King enuying ſore,
               doth warre on them beginne:
               But all in vaine his trauell was,
               he loſt, and nought could winne.
               Then of his Knight good Plaſidas
               
               to thinke he doth beginne:
               And wiſhing alwayes that he were,
               in Romane land with him.
               At length the King doth ſende abrode,
               through many a place and towne:
               His luſty Knightes in haſt to ſeeke,
               
                  Plaſidas of renowme.
               And bring him home to Romane lande.
               where earſt he was the Knight:
               That did moſt harme vnto his fees,
               by mortall dint of fight.
               
                  
And who that findes the ſame in ende,
               the king would honour giue:
               With riches eke in honour great,
               all dayes of life to liue.
               Within the armie of the King,
               two Knightes there were certayne:
               Who euer vnder Plaſidas,
               
               in warres did much remayne.
               They into Egipt land do goe,
               ſome newes for to heare tell:
               Of Plaſidas, and loe they chaunce,
               in ſtreate where he doth dwell.
               And Plaſidas from field doth come,
               as they were entred in:
               Then to inquire of Plaſidas,
               
               the Knightes doe now begin.
               If that he knewe not one, within
               that towne that had to name:
               
                  Plaſidas, who of chiualrie,
               did beare away the fame.
               He aunſwered them, and ſayd forſooth,
               no ſuch man I doe knowe:
               But yet he doth the Knightes deſire,
               vnto his houſe to goe.
               
                  
And take ſuch things as he poore ſoule,
               vnto them then might giue:
               Which might their weary faynting lims,
               from wearineſſe relieue.
               With whom they went with al their harts
               and their repaſtes did take:
               With ſuch ſmall chéere as he good man,
               at that time could them make.
               But when he did reuolue in minde,
               the ſtate that he was in:
               Sometime with them, good Lord therefore,
               to wéepe he doth begin.
               Then went he out from chamber where,
               the Knightes did then remaine:
               To waſh his face, and afterwardes,
               returne to them againe.
               But whileſt he was from them a time,
               they thought that it was he:
               Whome they appoynted were to ſéeke,
               and ſo agréed they be,
               At his retourne for to demaund,
               ſome licence and ſome leaue:
               To ſée a wounde which ſometime he,
               in battayle did receaue.
               
                  
At length he commes, and they to him,
               with gentle wordes doe ſpeake:
               Good ſir ſayd they, much like thou arte,
               to him whome we doe ſéeke.
               Therefore of thée we do deſire,
               this one thing for to loke
               Upon thy head, for ſuch a wounde,
               that he in battayle toke.
               They then behelde the wound, and knewe,
               full well that it was he:
               No tong can then expreſſe their ioy,
               fulfilled ſo they be.
               With ſtretched armes they him embrace,
               deſiring him to tell:
               Where that his children are become,
               and where his wife doth dwell.
               Then aunſwered he and ſayd his ſonnes,
               were refte of vitall breath:
               And as he thought, his wife likewiſe,
               taſted of cruell death.
               And howe the Maſter had his wife,
               vnto the Knightes he tolde:
               And how by force of armes from him,
               his wife he did with holde.
               
                  
This done, in haſt throughout the land,
               reporte doth blowe this thing:
               The neyghboures then do haſt vnto,
               
                  Plaſidas pore lodging.
               With maruelling, much like vnto
               a ſwarme of bees they goe:
               About the houſe and there the knightes,
               their meſſage forth do ſhew.
               And then they ray ſir Plaſidas,
               
               with veſtementes of price:
               Then from their ſeates to walke a while,
               the luſty Knightes ariſe.
               In haſt they leaue that ioyfull ſoyle,
               and homewarde do they wende:
               They are ariued in Romane lande,
               ere fyftene dayes were ende.
               The Emperour then when that he heard,
               that Euſtas was at hande:
               Doth ioy that God hath ſent this Knight,
               agayne vnto his lande.
               Now Trayan he doth ryde in haſt,
               
                  Plaſidas for to meete:
               And ioyfull Trayan Plaſidas,
               
               his louing friend doth greete,
               
                  
Then Trayan with Plaſidas,
               
               vnto his court doth goe:
               With great frequent of people that,
               behind them did followe.
               When he came there, of al his happes,
               he doth declare and tell:
               Of all the woes and miſeries,
               that vnto hym befell.
               Now his wife was taken him fro,
               how children both were ſlayne:
               And how himſelfe nowe fyftene yeares,
               did liue in dolefull payne.
               From thence they goe to banketting,
               to reuels and to play:
               In dauncing and in minſtrelſie,
               they ſpend that lucky day.
               And Plaſidas is made I ſay,
               Lieutenant of the bande:
               And all the ordering of the warres,
               is put into his hande.
               He then before him calles the Knightes,
               and doth their number take:
               Intending vp an armie great,
               in haſt forthwith to make.
               
                  
And doth commaund that ſtrayght,
               eche towne to him ſhould ſende:
               Two luſty men with Plaſidas,
               
               vnto the warres to wende.
               It happened ſo that that ſame towne,
               two ſouldiers forth muſt make:
               Which from the Lion and the Woulfe,
               thoſe tender babes did take.
               At length the townes men do agrée,
               that both theſe children ſhould:
               Goe with the Knight with willing mindes
               and heartes, euen ſo they would.
               The countrie men theſe ſouldiers twayne,
               did bring vnto the Knight:
               Their maners and their comelie ſhape,
               did much his minde delight.
               Wherefore with firſt at table he,
               hath placed the ſame to be:
               Bycauſe in them ſuch nobleneſſe,
               of maners he did ſee.
               The day is come, to battayle they,
               muſt wende euen out of hand:
               And now they muſt the great aſſault,
               of cruell foes withſtande.
               
                  
The battayles great on eyther part,
               the flames do reach the Skie:
               The roaring ſound of Canons ſhot,
               the force of walles doth trie.
               The Knightes with launce in hand I ſay,
               do pearce throughout the throng:
               The ſouldier doth aſſay to lay,
               his enimie all along.
               The battayle ſtandes in doubt of truth,
               which ſide ſhall other beate:
               Here martch they on amayne and there,
               they blowe agayne retreate.
               Here all along on ground they lie,
               and here from tourets hie:
               The deadly ſhaft through miſley cloudes,
               aloft in Skies doe flie.
               And here in fleſh it lightes full déepe,
               and giues a deadly wound:
               And in an other parte there is,
               a thouſand brought to ground.
               Here fighteth Plaſidas full harde,
               in midſt of all the throng:
               And here the children parent like,
               ſlay enimies along.
               
                  
They forwarde doe retire in haſt,
               and men afore do lacke:
               And Plaſidas aſſayles his foes,
               behinde vpon their backe.
               The wings that were the ayde and helpe,
               of foote men, goe their way:
               The battayles loſt, all through defacde,
               of keping their aray.
               The wings are fled, and battayle muſt
               by footemen ſtand a while:
               The battayls great, but at the length,
               they are brought to exile.
               The enimies flie from fielde amaine,
               and Romanes followe ſtyll:
               Upon the chaſe, for they did minde,
               their cruell foes to kyll.
               Retreate is blowen, and home agayne,
               to campe the ſouldiers hie:
               That willing were, eyther their foes,
               or they in chaſe to die.
               The towne is made full ſtrong and ſure,
               with rampiers for ſhotte:
               And eke eche ſyde of all the towne,
               with munition is hotte.
               
                  
The ſcaling lathers downe to throwe,
               they haue their iron ſtaues:
               They haue their hatchets for to cut,
               in ſunder all their raues.
               Some ſtand with ſtings from far to ſtrike,
               the Romane armies great:
               Some ſtand with billes thoſe that aſſault,
               with furious force to beate:
               The pike men they on walles doe ſtande,
               their towne for to defende:
               And ſome from towre with bow in hande,
               the graygooſe wing do ſende.
               The labourers do mende the walles,
               with gonſhot all to ſhake:
               The townes men all within the towne,
               do ſéeke defence to make.
               And ſluiſes al are opened,
               to ſtop the enimies way:
               Leaſt that to ſcale their walles by night,
               the enimie doe aſſay.
               The night is come, and it doth parte
               the armies for that time:
               The watch man he aloft in towre,
               beginneth for to clime.
               
                  
The warde at gate is kept all night,
               the ſouldiers ſtand in ray:
               That when the onſet ſhall be giuen,
               reſiſt their foes they may.
               The night is gone, and breake of day,
               beginneth to drawe nie:
               By which the watch man in the towre,
               the armie may diſerie.
               And ſée from farre howe Plaſidas,
               
               doth order all his bande:
               How that he telleth them the way,
               their foes for to withſtande.
               He doth declare, as he can déeme,
               what number that they be:
               And doth eſpie if any troupe,
               of horſe men he may ſee.
               That doth aproch vnto the towne,
               for to increaſe their feare:
               
                  Plaſidas ſent horſe men forth,
               to range both here and there.
               To ſée if that they enter would,
               from towne, and would deſcend:
               In open fielde by force of armes,
               their citie to defende.
               
                  
But they within did kepe themſelues,
               in order for to fight:
               Then had the day quite drone away,
               the lothſome myſtes of nyght.
               And Plaſidas his comely trayne,
               vnto the walles doth bring:
               The which the watch man well perceyued,
               and al arme out doth ring.
               To walles they goe both tagge and ragge,
               their Citie to defende:
               And euery man his buſineſſe,
               doth duely nowe intende.
               The puſhing pikes ſtand next the walles,
               their enimies downe to fling:
               The ſtelly boyes the heauy earth,
               on ſhoulders thither bring.
               The ſunne from depth of Occean ſea,
               did ſcarce himſelfe areare:
               When as the Romane armie did,
               before the towne appeare.
               And then the gonnes the way doe make,
               through walles of ſtone and bricke:
               And eke the flames of fiers do,
               the tops of houſes licke.
               
                  
The Romanes, they bring to the walles,
               their ſcaling lathers hie:
               With iron hookes, vnto the tops
               of houſes for to tie.
               Now all the walles of Romanes ſtout,
               is filled to the ende:
               And more and more continually,
               vpon the walles aſcende.
               The towne is wonne, and Plaſidas
               
               in midſt thereof is ſet:
               And all their labour is as nowe,
               the ſpoyle thereof to get.
               The towne to duſt is quite conſumde,
               and burnt with ſcorching fire:
               The trumpets ſound triumphantly,
               to cauſe their men retire.
               Then after when the towne is wonne,
               and all was brought to ground:
               A reſting place for all his bande,
               there in a towne he found.
               In which his wife did dwell, and kept
               a houſe for hoſtage there:
               To whome hir ſonnes for harbor then,
               vnto hir do repaire,
               
                  
Not knowing what ſhe was, in déede,
               they there their reſtes doe take:
               And for their noble victories,
               great ioy they oft do make.
               At laſt the yonger doth deſire,
               the elder for to tell:
               His yong eſtate, and what to him,
               in childehode oft befell.
               Whoſe talke the ſilly mother oft,
               did liſten much to knowe:
               Some newes by warriers ſtoutly done,
               and afterwardes might ſhowe.
               The ſame vnto hir friendes that liſt,
               oft times of warres to talke:
               Therefore full oft I ſay ſhe doth,
               before the chamber walke.
               At laſt the eldeſt ſayd, good friend,
               I doe remember well:
               Howe that my father rulde the Knightes,
               of Rome that did excell.
               And eke a Lady faire I had,
               to mother well I knowe:
               Two children eke they had full fayre,
               I well remember ſo.
               
                  
My yonger brother was full faire,
               ſurmounting in degrée:
               All other men, ſo rich he was,
               with giftes of dame beautie.
               Long did they liue in ioy and bliſſe,
               within that lande I know:
               But yet by night he toke a ſhippe,
               and from that lande did goe.
               Unto a countrey not farre thence,
               the name I doe not knowe:
               The ſhippe is come vnto the porte,
               and then to land we goe.
               My mother ſhe behinde was left,
               but howe I can not ſay:
               But as I iudge, the Maſter he,
               my mother there did ſtay.
               And then from thence we did depart,
               vnto a towne thereby:
               With heauy minde, vntill he came,
               vnto a great ferry.
               And there he ſet me downe on ground,
               and ouer ſtrayght he bore:
               His yonger ſonne ouer the floud,
               vnto the other ſhore.
               
                  
And entring now the floud agayne,
               me thither for to fetch:
               A cruel Woulfe my brother yong,
               vp in his mouth doth catch.
               And wendes his way vnto the wood,
               my brother loud doth cry:
               My father ſtill he ſtriued harde,
               agayne to me to hie.
               But out alas, a Lion huge.
               came from the wood amaine:
               And ſnaccht vp me, and to the wood
               he did returne agayne.
               But when the Lion great and tall,
               the heard men they doe ſee:
               Their dogs they ſet vpon the beaſt,
               and ſo they ſaued me.
               The yonger ſayd, my brother deare,
               euen as I heard it tolde:
               The plowmen toke me from a Woulfe,
               which had me in his holde.
               By that thou ſaydſt, coniecture I,
               thy brother that I am:
               Loe happy day they both doe ſay,
               that vnto warres we came.
               
                  
The ioy that they doe make forſoth,
               no tong can it expreſſe:
               No heart can thinke, no eye hath ſéene,
               ſuch bleſſed ioyfulneſſe.
               The mother then hath heard their talke,
               and ponder it well doth ſhe:
               And doth reuolue within hir minde,
               if that hir babes they be.
               Then vnto Plaſidas ſhe goeth,
               and doth deſire him ſone:
               That he would let hir goe with him,
               for ſhe was borne at Rome.
               And as to him theſe wordes ſhe ſpake,
               in ſounding ſhe oft fell:
               And cried at length, O Plaſidas,
               
               I knowe thée very well.
               I am thy wife pore Theopis,
               
               which taken was thée fro:
               In midſt of floudes, when thou from ſhip,
               vnto the land didſt goe.
               The mighty God of heauen and earth,
               for thee hath kept me cleane:
               The Maſter he for his deſerte,
               vp darte of death is ſlayne.
               
                  
Then Plaſidas doth well perceyue,
               his wife, his loue and make:
               His heart, his life, and vnto him,
               in armes he doth hir take.
               What ioy was there I can not tell,
               my fingers weary be:
               To write the ſame, my eyes like that,
               in world did neuer ſée.
               The wife the huſband doth embrace,
               the man the wife likewiſe:
               The ioy to ſhewe, the teares doe guſhe,
               like ſtreames from out their eyes.
               And in their ioy, the wife demaundes,
               where that hir children be:
               Then he did ſay, my louing wife,
               their deaths my ſelfe did ſée.
               Two cruel beaſtes with foming mouthes,
               our children both hath ſlayne:
               Then ſayd his wife be of good chéere,
               aliue they both remaine.
               For loe, the God which vnto vs,
               this ioyfull méeting gaue:
               By his good grace and power diuine,
               did both our children ſaue.
               
                  
Then him ſhe tolde how ſouldiers twaine,
               their infancie did ſhowe:
               And ſtrayght he ſent for thoſe yong men,
               the truth of them to knowe.
               The children both vnto him come,
               and eche of them doth tell:
               His infancie, by which he knoweth,
               they be hys ſonnes full well,
               He then doth kiſſe and eke embrace,
               thoſe tender babes of his:
               The armie then for newes hereof,
               in heart right ioyfull is.
               They ſpende thoſe dayes in ioy and bliſſe,
               and after do intende:
               To Romane lande triumphantly,
               his hoſte and he to wende.
               But whileſt in warres he did abyde,
               good Trayan was deade:
               And Adrian in the Empire,
               ſuccéeded in his ſteade.
               Who in all miſchieues did abounde,
               as ſtories vs doe tell:
               For perſecuting of the truth,
               he did the reſt excell.
               
                  
When Plaſidas to Rome was come,
               and did a time ſoiourne:
               Then Adrian did him commaund,
               his Idols to adourne.
               For that the Romanes did poſſeſſe,
               ſo great a victorie:
               But Plaſidas would not ſo doe,
               he playnely did deny,
               That they were Gods, and vnto him,
               they nought at all could giue:
               He ſayd by Chriſt, in Chriſt it was,
               that he in world did liue.
               Then Adrian commaunded that,
               deuoured they ſhould be:
               Of a Lion in Church, whereas
               his Goddes the facte might ſee.
               And ſo it was as he commaunde,
               perfourmed eke and done:
               The Lion he moſt ioyfully,
               vnto their feete doth come.
               And there doth lie much like a dogge,
               
                  cum caude that doth play:
               And from their féete no man ywis,
               can get the beaſt away.
               
                  
But there he lies and mery makes,
               he doth no hhurt at all:
               Then Adrian doth ſtrayght commaunde,
               his men them forth to call,
               And doth commaund that they be put,
               in Oxe of braſſe to die:
               But nought they care, in Jeſus Chriſt
               they had their truſt wholly.
               The Oxe with flame is thorow hote,
               and they are put therein:
               And ioyfully in Chriſt they all,
               to ſing do then beginne.
               Thus ended they their mortall race,
               their file was at an ende:
               That we may ſo indure good Lorde,
               to vs thy mercy ſende.

            FINIS.
