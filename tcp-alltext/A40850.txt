               YOU beautious Ladies great and ſmall,
               I write unto you one and all,
               Whereby that 
                     •
                  ou may underſtand,
               What I have ſuffered in this land,
            
            
               I was by birth a Lady fair
               My fathers chief and onely heir,
               But when my good old father dy'd,
               Then was I made a young Knights bride.
            
            
               And then my love built me a bower,
               Bedec
                     •
                  t with many a fragrant flower;
               A braver bower you never did ſee,
               Then my true love did build for me,
            
            
               But there came thieves late in the night,
               They rob'd my bower, & ſlew my Knight,
               And after that my knight was ſlain,
               I could no longer there remain,
            
            
               My Servants all from me did flye,
               In the midſt of my extremity:
               And left me by my ſelf alone,
               With a heart more cold then any ſtone,
            
            
               Yet though my heart was full of care,
               Heaven would not ſuffer me to deſpair,
               Wherefore in haſt I chang'd my name,
               From fair Eliſe to ſweet William,
               
            
            
               And there withal I cut my hair,
               And dreſt my ſelf in mans attire,
               My Doublet, Hoſe, and Bever-hat,
               And a golden band about my neck,
            
            
               With a ſilver Rapier by my ſide,
               So like a galiant I did ride,
               The thing that I delighted on,
               Was for to be a Serving-man,
            
            
               
               
               The Second Part,
               to the ſame Tune
               
                  Thus in my ſumptuous mans array,
                  I bravely rode along the way:
                  And at the laſt it chanced ſo,
                  That I unto the Kings Court did go.
               
               
                  Then to the King I bowed full low,
                  My love and duty for to ſhow:
                  And ſo much favour I did crave,
                  That I a Servingmans place might have.
               
               
                  Stand up brave youth, the King reply'd,
                  Thy ſervice ſhall not be deny'd:
                  But tell me firſt what thou canſt do,
                  Thou ſhalt be fitted thereunto.
               
               
                  Wilt thou be Uſher of my Hall,
                  To wait upon my Nobles all:
                  Or wilt thou be taſter of my Wine,
                  To wait on me when I ſhall dine?
               
               
                  Or wilt thou be my Chamberlain,
                  To make my bed both ſoft and fine?
                  Or wilt thou be one of my guard,
                  And I will give thee thy reward.
               
               
                  Sweet William with a ſmiling face,
                  Said to the King, if 
                        •
                     t pleaſe your grace,
                  To ſhew ſuch favour unto me,
                  Your Chamberlain I fain would be.
               
               
                  The king then did the Nobles call,
                  To ask the counſel of them all,
                  Who gave conſent ſweet William he,
                  The kings own Chamberlain ſhould be.
               
               
                  Now mark what ſtrange things came to paſs,
                  As the King one day a hunting was
                  With all his Lords and noble train,
                  Sweet William did at home remain,
               
               
                  Sweet William had no company then
                  With him at home bar an old man:
                  And when he ſaw the Coaſt was clear,
                  He took a Lute which he had there.
               
               
                  Upon the Lute ſweet William plaid,
                  And to the ſame he ſung and ſaid:
                  With a pleaſant and moſt noble voice,
                  Which made the old man to re

                  Sweet William's Song.
                  
                     MY father was as brave a Lord,
                     As ever Europe did afford,
                     My Mother was a Lady bright,
                     My Husband was a valiant Knight.
                  
                  
                     And I my ſelf a Lady gay,
                     Bedeckt with gorgeous rich array,
                     The braveſt Lady in the Land,
                     Had not more pleaſures to command.
                  
                  
                     I had my muſick every day,
                     Harmonious Leſſons for to play,
                     I had my Virgins fair and free,
                     Continually to wait on me.
                  
                  
                     But now alas my Husbands dead,
                     And all my friends are from me fled,
                     My former joys are paſt and gone,
                     For now I am a Serving-man.
                  
                  The end of ſweet Williams Song.
               
               
                  At laſt the King from hunting came,
                  And preſently upon the ſame.
                  He called for the good old man,
                  And thus to ſpeak the King began.

                  What news haſt thou to tell to me,
                  Brave news the old man he did ſay,
                  Sweet William is a Lady gay.
               
               
                  If this be true thou telleſt me,
                  Ile make thee a Lord of high degree,
                  But if thy words do prove a Lye,
                  Thou ſhalt be hanged up pr

                  But when the King the truth had found,
                  His joys did more and more abound,
                  According as the old man did ſay,
                  Sweet William was a Lady gay.
               
               
                  Therefore the King without delay,
                  Put on her glorious rich array:
                  And upon her head a crown of gold,
                  Which was moſt famous to behold.
               
               
                  And then for fear of further ſtrife,
                  He took ſweet William for his wife,
                  The like before was never ſeen,
