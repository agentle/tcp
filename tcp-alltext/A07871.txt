            To the Reader.
            IT is wel noted of the wise Philosopher in his seuēth boke of moralls, oure nature to be suche throughe the conbinacion of contrary thinges, that we cannot take continuall delectation or pleasure alwayes in one kinde of thinge, but naturallye wee are inclined and desire to be pertakers of newes, of straunge and vnaccustomed thinges, of variable and diuerse matters whiche may breede some admiracion to any of oure sences. And if wee at anye tyme heare or see any thing that is egregiouslye dishonest, or syngulerly good, almost incredible or mouing delectable laughter: to t

               Of Golde and Siluer.
               GOlde throughe heate and fier is resolued, but not cō
                  sumed nor wasted. For of al kinde of metalles it leeseth nothing of his magnitude and substaunce, but the more often and longer that it burneth with heate, or is altered with fier, the better & more pure and excellent it is made. And therefore hath it alwayes bene accompted the most precious kinde of metall: the weight of it neither is diminished, nor eaten awaye by sharpe thinges, as salte, vynegar, Nitrū, and the iuyce of vnrype grapes. It is not difformed, nor made worse by ruste, nor in handling of it, or handes doo gather anye filthe, or vnclennes as in other kindes of metalles, the which thinges may easely proue golde farre to surmounte all other metalles. It is more flexible and soft then syluer, whereby it is lesse frayle and not so soone broken: being beaten with a mallet, it may be dryuen so thinne and so muche dilated, that of euery denary of it



may be made fiftie, or more thinne leaues or rayes of golde. It may be framed and wrought as small as threade, as it appeareth in golde wyar, and golde twyste. And sometimes it is wouen and wrought with sylke, wolle, and sometimes without. Of it many and goodly ornamentes be made, and for many vses, as rynges, bracelettes, chaines, crownes, tablettes, Iewelles, and diuerse kyndes & fashions of plates and suche lyke, yea (that whiche is scantly honest to bee spoken) of golde some haue made vessels to receiue the superfluous burden of the belly, the which thing Heliogabalus the Emperour,
                     Heliogabalus had his chamberpots of Golde.
                   being a monster and spectacle of all beastlynes is reported of diuerse authors to haue vsed. Syluer will melt and be resolued withe fyre, but if it remayneth anye long tyme therein, it leeseth some thinge of his substaunce. Sharpe thinges also haue power to waste and eate yt, & therefore it is not so preciouse as Golde: but yet it is of an harder substance than gold.
                     Syluer.
                   And that kinde of Siluer which is more flexible and softe, is the better because it is not so easye to be deuided, and to be broken,



it is lesse ponderous then Golde, and cannot so well be dilated.
            
            
               Of Spirites appearing in Mines.
               IT is not vnknowen to suche as haue beene occupied in deepe digginges of Mines, yt a kinde of sprytes dothe frequent and haunt in many Mynes, wherof some do no harme nor dammage to the laborers in Mynes, but wander in ye dū
                  geons, and where as they do nothinge in deede, yet they seeme to exercise themselues in working, sometimes in razing and digging the myne, sometimes in gatheringe together that which is digged vp, & manye times they seeme to turne the instrument whiche draweth vp the mettall from the myne, and diuerse tymes a man would thinke they did vrge and excite the laborers, and dryue them to worke.
               And this do they especially in such quarries and mines where in much Siluer is found, or els where some good hope is of fynding it
                     •
                   There be some of these sprites very hurtfull, as that which in the mine at Anneberg, was so noysome, that hee



destroyes a dosen laborers wherfore the sayde mine was vtterly forsaken and left notwithstanding the wealth of it.

               THe earth in Ireland is so fruitfull and so goode of pasture, that there cattell excepte they bee restrayned some tymes from pasture in Sommer, are like to be in daūger through sacietie. There is no hurtfull thing nor noysome beast:

                   no spider, no toade nor suche like eyther breedeth there, or ells beynge broughte from other countries thither, continueth or liueth there. The earthe of this countrye cast in powder vpon any daungerous beast or venemouse serpent of any other countrye, destroyeth & kylleth theym. There bee no Bees in this countrye, the temparatenes of the ayre is meruaylous, the fertilitie & fruitfulnes of the countrye is notable: the people of the countrye be voyde of hospitalitie, they are vnciuill and cruell, and ther fore not vnapt for warlike affayres, they attribute great honour to martial acts,



and knightly prowesse. The sea betwixe Ireland and Englande, do rage almoste continually, so that there is no safe passage but at certaine tymes.
            
            
               Of Englande and Scotlande.
               IN England there be no Wolfes, and if any bee brought thither they do not continue, and therfore their heards of cattel kepeth wel together, without any greate attendaunce of men. The sheepe haue hornes contrarye to those of other countries.
               In Scotland ther be certayne Trees whiche bringe forthe a fruite folded and wrapped vp in the leaues,

                        nacles commyng of a tree
                   and that fruit when in conueniente tyme it falleth into the water running by the tre, it reuiueth and taketh life and is transformed into a liuing fowle, which some call a goose of the tree or a Barnacle. This tree also groweth in the ysle of Pomonia, whiche is not far from Scotlande towardes the North. The auncient Cosmographers and especiallye Saxo the Grammarian, maketh mencion of this tree lykewise, &



therfore it is not like to be any fayned or deuised thing of late writers.
               
                  Aeneas Siluius writeth of this tree in this manner. We hard say there was a tree in Scotland which growing vppon a banck, and by the waters side bringeth forth fruit much like in forme to ducks, and the fruite of that tree when it is ripe to fall of it selfe, some vpon the land and some into the water, and those that falle vpon the earth, to putrifye and rotte, but those that falle into the water, straighte wayes with lyfe to swym oute of the water, and to flye in the ayre with fethers & winges, of the whiche thinge when wee made more diligēt serche being in Scotland with kinge Iames, a wise sad and graue man, we learned to fly from wondring and making such things miracles as were common, and that this famouse tree was not onelye to be found in Scotland, but also in the isles called the Orchades.
               
            
            
               Of an Isle in Spayne named Gades.
               
                  THere is a litle Isle in Spayne called Gades or Erythrea, ye pastures wherof do feede cattel so well that they can not drawe or seuer anye whaye from milke, but they must needes poure water, when they will haue their milke to curde. Theyr cattel also be lyke to dye at euery thirty dayes ende, excepte they be let bloude and so leese some quantitye of their bloud. The grasse wheron their sheepe feede, is somewhat drye, but yet it encreaseth a marueylous fatnes bothe in their fleshe, and also in their milke.
            
            
               Seneca the scholemaister of Nero the Emperoure.
               SAynct Hierome sayth that he was a man of most continent lyfe, and therfore hee accompteth him in the number of holy men, but especially for the often letters that hee wrote to. S. Paule & S. Paule to him. This Seneca beinge the scholemaister of Nero, was of greate power and aucthoritie, he wished himselfe to bee in the lyke degree with his countrye men, that Paule had amongest the

It is written that Nero hys cruell and cursed scholler, in recompence of his paynes and teachinge, put him to death .ii. yeares before the martirdome of Peter and Paule. When Seneca waxed olde, Nero callinge to remembraunce the punishment of the rod, wherwith Seneca corrected him in his childhode, admonished and commaunded him to chose what kinde of death he would dye,
                     An easye kinde of death.
                   wherby Seneca vnderstanding the Emperors will and pleasure, desyred that he might be

It is also found in auncient wrytinges that Plinye the second, beinge a verye graue and wyse man, in the raygne of Traianus the Emperoure, was suffocate and destroied with the flames & ashes of this hyll, whē that for the desyre hee had to see and note the nature and mocion of it, he presumed to go to neare.

This fowle doth greatlye aboue all other couet mens carcases, and by a singuler wit and naturall gift it vnderstandeth of mans death, presaging it fewe dayes before. With his sharpe eye sight also it perceiueth a farre of, his most desyred fode. There be some that wryteth merueylouse things of this fowle, that in the tyme of warre seuen dayes before hande, it smelleth and perceiueth by cente, the place where the battayle shalbe, and commonlye doth associate it selfe to that part, whiche it perceyueth shall perrishe with sworde.
               And therfore in auncient times, Prynces had their Sothesayers, and beholders of byrdes, that dyd most diligently looke vp on the eyes of the Rauens, and marke to what parte they turned their eyes, and whiche 
                     •
                  ide they did presage to perishe in battayle. S. Ambrose writethe that a Rauen conceiueth without the seede of ye male, and to haue generation withoute coniunction of males and females, & that



they liue exceding long, so that their age is ful complete with an hundreth yeres, and when they come to extreme olde age, that then the vpper parte of their bylls, doth so ouergrowe the lower parte, so y• it hindreth and restrayneth it, that they cannot open their bylls to take fodde, & therfore are compelled to dye by famyn, for he doth not sharpen his bill agaynste a stone as the Egle is wont to do.

If the wyfe were conuicte of adulterye, that then her husband & kinsfolke mighte punishe her, with what kynde of



death they woulde. It was not lawfull for the women of Rome to drinke wyne, & this was obserued many yeares, wher of was inuented an instrumēt of dower, in the whyche the Husbande promised the father of the wyfe, as often as shee brought for the children, that hee shoulde geue her as much wine to drinke the first viii. dayes as were decent and conueniēt,

               The mountayne called Aetna in Sicily.
               
                  AEtna is a meruaylous hill for continuall burning with flames of fyer, because it is full of Brimstone matter. It hath bene often tymes set on fyre with terrible flames as Mūster maketh mencion: the flames of it are in the night tyme horrible to be sene, because it 
                     •
                  hineth not as other fyers do. In the day tyme it burneth obscurely muche lyke to the flame of brimstone whereof the Hyll hath great store. The aunciente wryters haue vttered manye straunge thinges of this and especially Strabo who sayth, yt he was in the top of the Hyll, and there m
                     •
                  rked all thinges diligentlye. In the very top they affirme to be merueylouse mutacions and chaunges, for some times it casteth foorth greate store of fyer, and somtymes great flames & obscure smoke And it is to be wondred at the heate of ye fyar, because it cannot be tempered with any colde nor colde be dissolued throughe that heate. The higher part of the moū
                  tayne is full of ashes which in winter are couered with snowe: the verye top of the



hyll is playne & is in compasse about .xx. furlonges. In the night tyme fyer may playnly be seene in the hyll top, and in the day time a certayn obscure smoke ryseth vp: Many times continuall thundring is hard, beinge a terrour to the people, and blacke and burnte ashes are dispersed into diuerse places, and the ayre is made noysome with a most terrible smoke.
               The philosophers assigne a reason hereof because this Isle is in his inferiour parts full of cauerns and brimstone, of Allum, fyer and water, and such lyke, that are able to feede and nourishe fier. And fier cannot be without som vent or respiracle but it wil lift vp it selfe, and therfore many hote bathes be found in Sicily.
               
               The ayre also entring into the pores and cauerns of the earth, stirreth vp a flame which seeking for issue and eruption, vomiteth and casteth forth smoke and fyer, and in many places sercheth for ventinge holes and respiracles. Sometymes in ye inwarde partes of the earthe suche is the violence of the fier, that it expelle the and casteth forth with flames, burnt stones & sand and the heat which is included doth

It is straunge and scantly credibe to be spoken but yet more truer then truth it self, that one Printer may printe so manye letters in one day, that the swifteste Scriuener, or writer is not able to do so much in two yeares. This is an Almayne inuention, which was at the beginning in great admyration, and of no lesse lucre and profit.

The thing was first taken in hande with more boldnes and confidence then hope, about xvi. yeares before it began to bee common in Italy. The fyrste beginninge was at Magunce, the Germaines being the authors, with small and little principles and foundations, but shortly by the industrye of mans wit, it grewe to that perfection, that now in our tyme it hath. Trulye it had gone ill with all good discipline in these later days (if it were now to haue his beginning) seing that all are geuen to their bellies almoste, and to vnsaciable coueto

By this all kinde of learning hath encrease, & the noble actes of all nations are manifest to all the worlde: In lyke manner the memory and remembraunce of auncient antiquity

There bee some that writeth more ouer of him, that the Myce did gnawe and eate out and vtterly extinguish his name frō the walles and banginges.

She hath her nest in very highe trees, and sheweth as it were a naturall hatred agaynst the Gosse hauke and other kindes of haukes, as the hauke contrarye wyse seekethe her destruction continually: when they fight aboue in yt the ayre, they labour both especiallye for this one thing, that the one might ascend and be aboue the other, if the hauke getteth the vpper place, hee ouerthroweth & vanquishethe the Hernesew with a meruaylous earnest flight, but if the Hernesewe get aboue the hauke, then with hys dung he defileth the hauke and so destroihim, for his dung is a poyson to ye hauke and his feathers do putrifye and rotte after yt.

                  A Woman was deliuered of two female children, whole and perfecte in bodyes, but in the top of the forheade they were ioyned and grewe together vnseperably so that they must nedes beholde one the other. I my selfe sayth Munster did se them at Magunce in the yeare of our Lorde .1501. and then were they almost sixe yeres of age. They were compelled by force of this naturall coniunction to go both together, to slepe and rise together, and whē one went forward the other went backewarde: their noses did alnost touch together, their eies dyd not loke straight and forwarde but onely sideways, because a litle aboue their eies their forheads cleued & did stick fast togethe

                  faction.
               The occasion of this mōster was thought



to be this. Two women talked together wherof the one was with child, the third woman comming sodenly vpon them and vnloked for, thrust the heades of those ii. whiche were talkinge together, so that they dashed and touched ech other, wherof the woman that had conceiued alredy, being made afrayde through strong imagination gaue and printed the signe of the rushing of their heades in her two children.

               IT chaunced that at Magdeburge in Germany about the yeare of our Lord 1270. A certayn Iew vpon the Saterday fell into a Iakes, out of the whyche hee coulde by no meanes deliuer himselfe, he cryed therfore pitifullye for the helpe of his fellowes, at the length some of his companions came, and they withe lamentable voyces shewed yt it was their Sabboth day, & therefor not to be lawefull for them to vse or exercise the labour o

               This matter at the last came vnto the eeares of the Bishoppe of that place, who was nothing fauorable to the Iewes.

Wherefore a law was made that the Lacedemonians should no more enter into their feastes with a staffe. Euery one gaue yerly to this feast, one bushell of flower, viii. gallons of wine, fiue pound of cheese, fiue pounde and a halfe of figs.

Moste apte and readye to suffer fasting and watching. There is no sedition amongest them, no tumult. They vse horrible sounds and not outcries in war, in their tentes in the night tyme, there is such diligent silence, that they had rather suffer their prisonners to escape, then to moue any tumul

The souldiers haue an honest kinde of apparel. In their saddles, and bridels, there is no curiouse superfluitie. No man goeth armed but in the tyme of warre. Their weapons are brought after them in burdens, they vse no banners nor standerds, but in the tops of their Iauelins they haue certayn threades



of diuers colours hanging wherby one captayne is knowen from an other.
               They vse the drumme & the fluite to call and moue them to fight. They praye for their souldiers in euerye congregation & solempne meeting, but rather for such as haue dyed for their country, calling them happye and blessed, that they dyed not at home in the lamentacion of their wiues, and children, but abroade amongest their enimies weapons, and terrible noyses.
               They wrighte and describe the victories of their auncestours, they sing and extoll them being written, for they thinke their souldiers myndes to be muche encouraged by these meanes. They do so abhorre pictures and engraued images, that vpō such causes they call the christians idolaters. They haue no bells, nor yet do suffer the christians abiding amongest them to haue bells, They neuer play for mony or any other thing, but such as be founde playing be greuously staundred in euerye mans mou

               The table wheron they feede for the most part is prepared of an oxe hide, or an hartes skinne, vndressed and rough with heare still, hauing the roundnes of foure or fyue hand bredthes. No man entreth in to any house, church, or other place wher in they muste sit, vnlesse his shoes be of, because it is accounted an vnhoneste and vndecent pointe for anye man to sit withe his shoes on his feete, and therefore they vse a kinde of shoes, that may easly be put on and of. The place wher they sit eyther at home or in the Churches, is strewed & couered either with tapestrye clothes, or broade clothe or rushes, and sometymes for the moysture and vncleanes of ye place they haue bourdes and tables.
               The garments bothe of men and women are large and longe ynoughe open in the former parte.

               Their priestes do not much differ from ye laytie, nor their churches from common houses. It is sufficient to knowe ye booke which is called Alcorane, and such thinges as appertayne to prayer & obseruāce of the Lawe. They lacke not their readinges and studies of artes and sciences. They haue no care of churches nor soules departed. They haue no sacraments nor obseruation of reliques, holy vessells nor alters, but they are attente and diligent in loking to their children, their wiues & familye, to tillage of the ground, to marchandize,



to hunting, and like exercises, wherwith lyfe is mainteyned. They bee free from seruitute and exactions, these priestes be honored of euery body as men that knowes the ceremonies of the lawes haue the gouernment of churches, & can instruct others.

The Turkes ceasse from all labour on the Fryday, and keepe it withe as much religion and deuocion, as we do the Sonday. But the Iewes do meruaylously obserue the Saturday. In euerye Cittie there is one principall Churche, wherin they meete together after noone euery body, & after their prayers solemplye done, they haue a sermon. They haue large and sumptuouse temples, whyche are called in their tongue Meschit, wher in they haue no Images at all, but it is found written euery where. There is no God but one and Mahumet his prophet one creator and the prophets equall. And also There is none so strong as God.
               
               There be in their churches a great number of burning lampes with oyle. All the churche is white, the pauement is layde with mats and other thinges, and aboue



many clothes of tapestrye, and Arras be hanged. There is a great turret about ye churche, on the top wherof their minister when seruice tyme is, standethe and puttinge his fingers in his Eares, withe an highe voyce in his owne tongue, he repeteth these wordes thrise. One true God. when this crie is harde, the nobles and ye meaner forte commeth to the temple, only intent to deuocion, & the minister prayeth with them, and that he oughte to doe fower tymes betwene daye and nighte by his office, & they which come to the prayers, ought to wash their handes and fete and secret parts.

of senses wherin they wash bothe handes and armes euen to the elbowes, then their mouth, their nosethrils, and al their face. Both men & women do make a scraping of filthye places euery moneth twise or thrise, but especiallye when they frequente the Temples, otherwise they should be burnt as violaters and prophaners of a sacred place. They vse such seueritie in war, that no souldier dareth take away any thing vniustly, for if he doth he shalbe punished withoute mercie.
               They haue ordinarie kepers and defenders of those thinges as bee in souldiers wayes, the which are bound to mainteyn the orchardes and gardeynes, with their fruites, about highe wayes, so that they dare not take an apple or any such like, wt out the lycence of the owner. For if they dyd they should suffer death for it.
               Of this writeth one Barthelmewe Giurgeuitus, that was captiue thirtene yeres in Turkie, after this sort. When I was in the Turkes armie in his expedition againste the Persians, I did see a certayne horseman headd

entered into the fieldes of another man. None of the princes or Dukes possesseth any prouince or cittie, as rightfull enheritance, nor they cannot leaue anye suche thing after their death to their children, or successors withoute the consente of the king and supreme gouernour. But if ani Duke desireth to haue any certayne possessions, it is graunted to him vpon thys condicion, there is a perfect note made of the price, & of the rents, and reuenues of those possessions. The Turke knowethe also how many souldiers may be kept, wt that yearly reuenue, and so many souldiers he enioyneth him to kepe, the whiche ought alwayes to be in a readines at euerye commaundement, otherwise yt Lorde shall lose his head, if he did not aunswere his duetie and office.

vpon him a companye of butchers and sellers of Boyes to abhominable vses, who cary with them a great number of long chaynes, in hope of bondmen and captiues, wherein they lincke and bynde fiftie or three score easlye by order. The same men do bye also of suche as haue boties or prayes, as many as haue not perished with swoorde, the whiche thinge is permitted them vppon this condicion yf they geue vnto the prince the tēth or tithe of their bondmen prisoners and capti

                  es The other it is lawful for them to keepe to their owne vse and marchandize, and there is no better nor moore plenteouse a marte amongest them, then of bondmen. The Emperour doth so seperace the olde men and the youth of both kindes which cōmeth to him in the name of the tenth or tithes, that he selleth theym of ripe age, for the ploughe and husbandrie. Younge maides and yong men hee sendeth awaye to a certain place, to be instructed in certaine artes, that he might vse them after warde moore commodiouslye, and firste they goe aboute this to make theym denye their christian faith, and then to haue



them circumcised, and whē they are once entered into their ceremonies, according to euery mans disposition and wit, hee is appointed either to studye the Lawes of their nacion, or elles to practise feates of war if more strength appeareth in the bodye than in his wit, they are so instructed in the principles of warlike affayres, that for the weakenes of their strenght, fyrste they vse an easy bowe, afterward as their strength increaseth and they haue moore exquisite knoweledge, they haue a more strong bow vntill they be meete for war. There is a maister whiche calleth seuerlye vpon daylye exercise, as often as they swarue from the marke so oftētimes are they whipped. Others are made meete aud cunninge to fight with staues. But they in whome there is a greater grace of beautiful forme are so māgled that no manlines appeareth in their bodies, they haue bene so abused with great daunger of lyfe, and if they do escape they be mete for nothing els but ministers of moste flagitious voluptuousenes, and when their beauty waxeth olde, thei are deputed into the office of Eunuches, to obserue and



kepe matrones, or ells they are addicted to the custodye of Horses or Mules, or to kitchin drudgerie. Maydens that are verye comelye and beautifull, are chosen to be their concubines, those of the meaner sort are geuen to matrones to wait vpon them, where they haue some suche filthye seruices and functions, that they cannot be named with honesty, for they are compelled to folow them with a vessell of water when they go to discharge the bellyr, and those partes. Other be kept at maydens workes, as spinning, and bakinge. When the Turks haue gotten any yong prisoners, they vrge theym with threateninges, promisses, and flateringes, that their new bond men wold be circumcised and when any hath admitted that, hee is vsed with a little more humanitie, but al hope of returning again into his country is vtterly taken awaye, and if he once goeth about it, he is in daunger of burning. These because they are thoughte moore stedfast, and lesse geuen to run away, thei are preferred of their Lordes to warlike affayres, their libertie is then dewe vnto theym, when they being vnprofitable for



yeares be rather reiected of their Lordes than dismissed, or ells where their Lorde hath geuen them libertie in warre, for ye daunger of death that he hath escaped by them. Matrimony is permitted vnto thē but their children are taken from theym at the Lordes will, the which causeth the wiser sort to abhorre frō mariages, they vse other extremely that refuse circumcision. They haue a very hard life that haue not learned any art or craft: for such are in great estimation as are cunning craftes men. Wherfore the noble men, the priestes and the learned sort, which passe ouer their liues in quietnes and idlenes, whensoeuer they chaunce into their handes, they are thought moste miserable o

               These go with their feete and head vncouered, and for the most parte with naked bodies, through the snowe, and vpon the stones, both winter and sommer they are enforced to trauayle, and there is no end of these miseries, before that eyther they dye or ells they fynde a foolishe Lorde in

No man is so happy of what condicion so euer hee be, or of what age, beautie or arte he bee yt they wil lay him, being sicke in his iorney, at anye Inne or lodginge house, for first hee is cōpelled to go wt stripes & if he cānot so do he is set vpō som yong beast, & there if he cannot syt, he is boūde with his bodye flat euen lyke vnto a packe or a burden, if he dyeth they take awaye hys clothes and cast him into the next ditch or valley for dogs and rauens. They keepe their captiues not onely in chaynes, but also withe gyues vppon their handes, as they leade them, the distance betwene thē is about a yearde, least they shoulde one spurne and hurte an other, and this doe they for feare their bondmen hurle stones at them. For where as euerye one that is a cōmon marchant and seller of men, leadeth a great number of bondmen, so that ten of them oftentimes haue fiue hundred in chaynes, they feare the force of suche a great multitude, if their handes shoulde be at libertie to throwe or cast any thing.

If anye be taken with his wife and childrē, noble men wil bye him gladlye, and make him ruler of his vilages, and geeue him charge of his groundes, vineyardes and pastures, but his children must be bondmen, if they perseuer and continue in christian faith they haue a determinate tyme to serue, yt whiche being paste, they are made free, & yet their childrē except thei be redemed cōtinue in seruitude and bōdage at the wil & pleasure of the Lorde.

The Turkes take also out of the christian churches all bells, organes, and other instruments of musicke, and after they haue prophaned the churches they consecrate thē to Mahumet. They leaue pore and small chapples to the christians, where they may do their holye seruice, not openlye but in silence, the which if they fall by any earthquake, or be ruinouse by any sodeyn fyer it is not lawfull to repaire them againe, but through great sommes of money geuen. They are forbidden to preach or teache the Gospell, and it is not lawefull for any christian man, to beare anye rule in ye common wealthe, nor to beare weapons or vse like vesture with the Turkes. If anye contumelious wordes be spoken of ye christian or of Christe, he must suffer it, &

Those captiues that goe aboute to flye away yf they go into Europe, they haue the easier flighte, seinge that nothinge is to hinder their passage, but certaine waters which are passed ouer easlye, and this doo they most attempte in harueste tyme, because then they may hide them in the corne and liue therby: in the nighte tyme they take their flight, and in the day time they hide



them selues in woodes and puddles or in the corne, and had rather be deuoured of wolues, and other beastes then to be sent againe to their olde maisters. But they which into Asia take their flight, go first to Hellesspont betwixt Callipolis and ye two towers which were of olde called Seston and Abydon, but now they are named Bogazassar the castells of the Sea, mouth, and with them they cary both an axe and ropes to cut downe woode and to bynde them together, wherof they make boates or little ships to passe ouer the sea, carying nothing but salt with them, and in the night time they conuey themselues into the ship in the water. If the winde and the sea fauoreth thē, they passe ouer in thre or four howers, but if the trouble some sea be against them, eyther they perishe in the water or els be cast agayne to the coaste of Asia.
               
               When they are gotten ouer the Sea, they seke vnto the mountayns, and beholdinge the Pole, they take their iourney towardes the North. In their hunger they refresh thē selues with salted herbs. If manye runne awaye together, in the



night time they inuade shepeheardes and flea them and take away all such meate & drinke as they fynde, but yet many times they theim selues be slayne of the sheepeheardes, or ells taken of theim and so deliuered to their olde maisters, to all kind of seruitute: and the greater number is consumed with daungers, for few escape free and safe, because they perishe eyther by shipwracke, or by deuouring of beasts or by their enemies weapons, or elles by famme, when as it chauncethe that they after their running away make any long abode in the woods. Many kindes of punishmentes are prepated, deuised, and appointed for fugitiues, and such as run away, for same being hanged by the feete are most cruelly tormented with whips, and they that cōmit homicide or murder, haue the soles of their feete cutte withe a sharpe knife in many slyces and cuttinges and after they are so cut the woundes bee

               IN the countrie called Ionia there is y• noble city of Ephesus, which was built in the 32 yeare of the raygne of kinge Dauid by Androchus the son of Codrus king of Athens.

Saint Ihon also the Euangelist died in this cytie. But this sumptuouse temple was destroyed and set on fyer in the raygne of Galienus the Emperor, by one Erostratus whoe doinge manye notable feates in war and otherwise, when he perceiued yt he got no reward nor renowne there by, to leaue a continuall remembrance of his flagitious and horrible act, did with greate fiers and monstruous flames, cōsume this faire churche, and brought it ta ashes, thinking there by to be remembred in perpetuitie: and yet he was deceiued, for there were generall edices and proclamacions made, that no man vppon payne of death shuld presume once to put his name in any writing or chronicle, to the enten

               These wordes as Cicero saith might haue bene written vpon the sepulchre of an oxe, and not of a king. He was a most effeminate man geuen to all kinde of luxurye, and was not ashamed to spin amongest cōmon harlots & in womens vesture and attyre, to excell all others in laseiuiousnes. Wherfore the Assirians disdayninge to obey and subiect theym selues to such a feminine prince rebelled and made warre agaynst him, who being ouercome wente into his palace, and there making a greate fier caste himselfe and all his riches into the fier and so ended his lyfe.

Some saye yt they had their beginning of the Scythians after this sort. Certayn Scythians being driuen frome their countrye withe their wiues & remayning in the coasts of Cappadocia vsing to rob and spoyle the borderers, were destroyed at the lengthe by conspiracie and disceit. The wiues that folowed their husbandes and seinge that they were left alone, tooke weapons and defended their borders and also moued war againste their neighbours, they had nomynde at al to marye with their neighbours, calling it a seruitute and not matrimonye, a singuler example of al ages, they encreased their common wealthe wt
                  out husbandes, and that one mighte not seme more happy then another they slew such husbandes as remayned at home.
               At the length when they had gottē peace by force of armes, they vsed the society of men in the countries by them, least their whole nacion shoulde perishe for lacke of



procreation, and if any men children wer borne they destroyed them, and their yōg women and maydes did not vse spinning nor carding, but hunting and handlinge their weapons, so that euery female childes breast was sered and burnt away lest they might be hindred therby in shoting, whereof they toke that name & were called Amazones. They conquered a great part of Europe and did occupy many citties in Asia, thei had .ii. quenes, Marthesia and Lampedo, which deuidinge their armie into two parts, kept their battels with great welth and strength, defending their borders stoutly. They did build Ephesus and Smyrna in Asia the lesse, & did inhabite the chiefe citie in Cappadocia. Some say that in some places amongest theym they had husbandes, and that the women did beare all the rule and did al common busines and that the men did keepe charge at home like women, obeying the women in all thinges.

This Sergius being a Nestorian archeheritike banished from Constantinople fled into Araby, and asociating him selfe vnto Mahumets familiaritie, an ill maister and gouernor with a most filthy and abhominable scholer was sone vnited together, hee was a prater and ful of wordes, bold, rashe, impudent, subtile, craftye, and in al thinges agreing with Mahumet, who now was waxed mightye, aud could helpe at a pinthe, and whose name began to be famous and so at the length the runnagate found a filthie priuy and dungeon of all wickednes.

               Of the Panther and Tygre.
               THe Panther is a beaste like vnto 
                     •
                   Lybarde, he hath varietie of colors and is verye fierce and wylde, so yt some cal him a dog wolfe, and yet hee is gentle ynough if he be fylled. He slepeth three dayes, and after the thirde daye, he washeth himself and cryeth out, and with a swete cente that commeth from him, he gathereth al wilde beastes together whiche are led and moued with his sauoure,



and he is frendly to all wylde beastes sauing the Dragon and serpent. The she Panther is sayd to be a beaste differinge from the male, because shee is cruel and ful of spotts. Some saye that al beastes are merueylously delighted with the cent of them, but by their horrible lokes they are made a frayde, and therfore hydinge their heades, they take and catche other beastes allured withe the pleasantnes of them, as gotes & such lyke, which beinge taken with a fond desyre of their pleasātnes commeth nearer and nearer, but the Lybard leaping out of her den, flyeth vp on them.
               In Caria and Lybia the panthers be of a good lengthe and some what timerous & not so ful of agilitie in leaping, but they haue so hard a skynne, that you can hardlye pearse it, the female is more common to be founde. The Tygre is a beast of a wonderful swyftnes, it bringeth foorthe many yong, the which many do steale awaye vpon horsebacke very swyft: But when the female seeth her yong gone, for the males take no care of the yonge, shee runneth headlong serching by smelling.



The taker of her yong hearing her comming neare with raginge, casteth downe one of the yong, the whiche shee taketh away with her mouth, and after that shee retourneth again with merueilous celeritye, so that she getteth another, and so the thirde tyme, and vntil that hee hathe gotten into a ship, and then she seing her fiercenes frustrate rageth on the bankes S. Augustine saythe there was a Tygre made tame at Rome in a denne. Strabo saith Megasthenes writeth that in India amongeste the people called Prasii, the Tygre is of double bignes to the Lyon, & of such strength, that one being led wyth four men, if he should catch a mule wythe his hinder clawe, he were able to drawe the mule vnto him. Some say when she hath lost her yong, she is deceiued & mocked in the waye with a glasse, s

                  t there by the stealer of her yong, for she folowinge with her smelling and swifte running, & fyndinge the glasse thinkinge her selfe to haue found her yong, taryeth so longe in vewing the glasse, that he which toke her yong, hath time ynough to escape.

               THE Parthians haue their armies commonly of the greater number of seruaunts and bondemen, as euerye man is more wealthy, so dothe hee fynde a greater number of horsemen to ye kinge for his warre. They haue mauye wyues for the auoydinge of lecherye, and they punishe no fault more greuously thē adulterye: wherfore the women may not come to the Feastes of men, nor in their sight. They eate no other fleshe then such as they get by hunting, they be alwayes on horsebacke, they ride to their bankets and to warre, they do marchandize, they common together, they do all common & priuate affayres sittinge on Horse backe, their deade bodies are open Prayes for fowles or dogs, they haue a speciall care of worshipping the Gods, they haue fear full wits, sediciouse, pratling, and disceitful.

Some say the Parthians whē they poured in the melted golde into hys mouthe sayde: Nowe drinke golde thou that hast alwayes thirsted for Golde, and as yet couldest neuer be filled with gold. The whiche sayinge is also rehearsed of Tomyris the queene of the Massagets in Scythia,

               IN Carmania no man may haue a wife before he hath brought the head of his enemie cut of to the kinge. The kinge cutteth the tong therof into small partes and mingleth it with bread, & afterward geueth it to be eaten to him that brought it and to his familiers, and he is a notable felowe that bringeth many heades.
               The Icthiophagi be so called because they eate fishe most commonly and so doe their cattell, and they drincke raynie and wel water. They feede their Fyshe with beasts fleshe. They make their houses of whales boones and oyster shels, of theyr fishe being dryed they make breade, putting a little wheate vnto it, for they haue small store of wheate. It is read of this nacion that many of them goynge naked al their liues haue their wiues and children in common like vnto beastes, yt haue no difference of honesty and dishonestye.

Suche enemies as they take they cut of their heades and set theim vppon an highe pole in the tops of their houses. There be also in this parte of Asia certayne people that haue their women in common,

                  and some so rude and beastlye, that they eate mans fleshe obeying no lawes. There be others called Agrippaei whiche are balde from their natiuitie aswell men as women.

They be good horsemen and il fotemen, & therfore none goeth on fote, but rydes either on horsebacke or vpon some oxe. They haue a glorye to hang good sounding bels about their horse necks. When they drink they powre it in vntil they be drunken,

They roste the bodies of suche as they take in war to showe their crueltie and desyre of reuenging, and where many metes together at the eating of them, they teare thē with their teeth lyke wolues, and drinke the bloud therof, whiche they reserued afore in cups, otherwise they drinke cowes mylke. One of thē eateth the lyce from anothers head, saying: thus wil we doo to our enemies. It is an heynous thinge with them to suffer any drinke to be loste or any meate, and therefore they caūe no bones to dogs before that the marie bee taken away, and many other things are reported of them which Munster setteth forth more at large. In warre they haue swordes of a yarde in length, their horsemen are very skilful in shoting, their princes neuer enter into war but standinge a

If they gette the victorie they spare none, neither women, nor children, nor olde folkes, they slea all sauing craftes men and artificers whom they reserue to their vses. They are very incontinēt, and therfore they take as many wiues as they wil, and may sustayne, and they except none, but the mother, the daughter, and sister, & yet they be much geuen to the Sodomiticall sinne

               There bee others whose lyfe is longer, there be meruailous greate beastes bred in that countrye, and trees of such height that a man cannot shote to the top of thē, this commeth by the fertilitie of the soyl

It bringeth forth Narde, Cinam, Pepper, Calamus, Aromaticus, & other spyces, and also diuerse pearle and preciouse stones. Pliny sayth that in the countrie of Inde, al thinges are bred of a greater magnitude then in any other countrie as men, beastes, and trees. The people haue a bushie heare, and a special decking wt precious stones, they are verye diuerse in apparel, some weare wollen garmēts, and some linnen, many go naked & some couer their priuie partes onely. The colour of the bodye is commonlye blacke, beinge in their mothers wombe, suche through the disposicion of their parents, they be of a good talle statute and strong They be thriftye in lyuing and very continente from thefte.

He that is reprehended as a false witnes, hath the tops of his fingers cut of, he that depriueth any man of any member, hath the lawe Talio, that is to lose the like member, and also his hande is cut of.

There be seuen special orders amongest the Indians,. The first is of philosophers, which being fewe in number were prefered before the rest in honor and dignitie, they are free from all workes, and neyther serue anye bodye, nor gouerne or rule, thei take such things of pryuate folkes wherwith they do sacryfice, and they haue a care of the dead, & especially kn

y• knowledge whereof is profitable, that philosopher which forsheweth any thing that is false, hath no other punishmente, but to kepe silence foreuer. The seconde order is of husbandmen, which exceding the rest in multitude being free frō warres and other workes, do onelye bestowe their time in tilling the groūd, no enemie offreth any iniurie to them, because they are thought to be occupied about the cō

                  ouldiers exercised in warlike affaires, and they and al their horses and Elephants be mainteined by ye prince



The sixt is of superintendeutes, who seing al things that be done in India, make relacion therof to the king. In ye seuenth order be those that haue the rule of common coūsels beinge but a few in number and such as moste excel in nobilitie & wisdome, for of these some bee chosen to the kinges counsel, and to the administracion of the common wealth, and to be iudges in doutful cases, Dukes also & captains be chosen of them.
               Thus Inde being distribute into these partes it is not lawful for anye order to marrie with the mens wiues of an other order, nor to chaunge his trade of liuing, nor for the souldier to plaie the plowghman, nor the Artificer, to meddle in the Philosophers office. And because Inde, is so great a countrie, there be manye nacions discrepant in forme and tonge, and maners, for som inhabiting about riuers and lakes do eate rawe fishe, and others rawe fleshe, and when anye fal

yet they kil him and make a bāket of him so he that liueth in perfecte healthe to his olde age is slayn and deuoured in like maner. And therfore fewe of them come to extreame olde age. There be some of the Indians that neuer kil any liuing thinge nor plant nor sowe anie thing, nor erect any houses but liueth onely with herbes, amongest whō when any falleth sicke he goeth into a desert place, & ther dieth, no man taking care either of him dyinge or being dead, they vse naturall coniunction together openlye like vnto brute beasts.

               The notes of a good Horse.
               THere be some that writes, that an horse shoulde not be broken nor tamed before two yeares of age. But that he is to bee rubbed and chafed withe flattring and gentle wordes, and that his

                  table shoulde be layde with stone, and to vse him by little and little to goe on the stones, that his feet might be made strōg At the beginning let not him that shal sit him or breake bee to roughe, nor wearye him with running: let him proue him wt turninge gently on both sides, and not so much with spurrs as with the sticke hee muste touche him: the horse shoulde be of one colour, of a thicke mayne and standing vp, of strong loynes, of a short head, his necke must be erect and standing vp,



his eares smal according to the proporcion of his head, abroade breaste, a meane belly, short hips, a large tayle and somewhat curled, straight legs, equal knees, stedfast hoofes and grosse, not bigge nor smal that thei be not worn, his legs must be wel stuffed with bones and not wythe fleshe, the notes and signes of yeares, in horses, are chaunged with their bodies.
               When a horse is two yeares and a halfe olde, his middle teeth both aboue and beneathe do fall, when he is thre yeares old, he casteth those that are like vnto doggs teeth, and bringeth forth new, before sixe yeares of age his vpper double teeth doo fal, at the sixt yeare he supplyeth those yt he wanteth, at the seuenth yeare all are supplied equally, from that time he hath hollow teeth, and therefore it is harde to discerne their ages, at the tenth yeare the temples begin to waxe hollowe, and the browes sometimes waxe graye, and their teeth sticke out. Mares haue their full increase in fyue yeares, but horses in sixe yeares. Xenophon teacheth these properties to be obserued in an horse.

               Of certayne monstruouse people in India.
               MAnye are found in India both men women and beastes ful of heare, & with leaues and mosse on theym, which commeth of the greate heate that there is. Pliny saith that the inhabitāts of this countrie be coloured with the son, and ther by come to certain blacknes like vnto the Ethiopes, not because they are outwardly so blacke through the adustiō of the sonne, but naturally in their bloud ther is an inclinacion to blacknes, ye whiche the heate of the son doth seeme to double. Oure auncestors haue fayned many monsters in this countrie, as people with heades like vnto dogs armed onely with 
                     •
                  ayles, clothed with hides & skinnes, hauing no kinde of mans speach but onelye



a kinde of barking. There be some that liue at the fountayne of Ganges, whiche take no benefit by meat but liue onely by the sauour of wilde apples, and whē they go far they carrye them for their maintenance, and liue by the smel and sauour of them. If they come into any filthy or stin king ayre, they must needes dye, and it is sayd that some of theym were seene in the tents and armie of Alexander.
               
               We reade also that ther be certaine people with one eye in India, and some to haue so great eares that they hang downe euen to the feete, and manye to haue but one foote, and that so greate that when they lye downe on their backs and wolde kepe them from the sonne, the shadow of that onelye leg doth comfort theim. It is read also that there is a nacion whiche hath graye heares in youth, the which in age waxeth black, and also men saye ther is an other kinde of women whiche conceiue at fiue yeares of age, but they liue not aboue eight yeares, there be some yt lacke neckes and haue eyes in their shoulders, there be wilde men also withe beades like vnto dogs, with a rough and heary



body which make a terrible hissinge, but these and such like are not to be credited and taken for truthe, except great reason can perswade that such maye bee and experience can proue the same. It is also thought that ther is a certayn people called Pygmeis which be neuer in peace but when the cranes with whome they haue continuall warres,

see, & so that battel was turned to laughinge. Apes are taken after this maner they that hunt apes, set dishes full of water in the sight of the apes, and therewith they annointe and washe their eyes, and sodenly with as priuye spede as they can, they take awaye the water and set pots wt birdlime, and such like stuffe in stede ther of, the apes perceiuing them anointinge their eyes, being geuen to folow al thinges, come downe immediatlye from the trees, and thinking to do as the men did, they dawbe and annoynte their eyes and mouthes with birdlime, and so are they easye to be made a praye and taken aliue.

His bytinge is cruell and sharpe, and he so rendeth with his teeth, yt it can neuer be healed, there is great store of them about Nilus, because they are verye fruitful of themselues, hauing yonge euerye yeare, and also they are seldome taken. It is a feareful beast flying from those that persecute him, and persecuting those that flye away from him. It is said that when hee goeth aboute to deuoure a man that hee beginneth to weepe, wher of hath sprong this prouerbe.

               Of the Empire of Cathay.
               
                  THe Empyre of Cathay is ruled by the great Cham. With this naciō one man may haue many wiues, & when the husband dyeth, euery wyfe pledeth her owne cause before the iudges, & sheweth her merits, so that which of thē so euer is adiudged to haue bene the most officiouse and dearest wife to her husbād, shee in her best apparell and with all her iewels, as though she had gotten the victorie of the other, goeth willynglye and merelye vnto the heape of wood wher her husband shall be burnt, and lyinge down by his carcasse and embracinge it the fier is kindled, and so shee is burnte with her husbād: the other of his wiues after this liue in greate shame and obloquye. They matche not together for wealth or nobilitye, but for excellencye of beauty and procreaciō sake. The people of Cathay haue this opinion that they thinke no other nacion to see with both eyes but thē selues, they are perswaded also that they excell all other in subtilitye of artes and scyences. It is a whyte kynde of people, withoute beardes, of small eyes, and lackinge true pietie and due obeysance to God: for



some of them worshyp the Sonne, some the moone, others certayne immages of mettalls, and other some an oxe, so that they be full of monstruous supersticion. The Emperour keepeth his court at his citye called Cambalu, whiche is the noblest marte in that part of the world, for there is almost neuer a day through out ye yeare, but that a thousand carte lodes of silke almoste are chaunged and broughte there amongest marchants. The Emperour kepeth in his court twelue thowsand horsemen to kepe his bodye. Their order of watchinge is thus. One captain with three thousand gardeth the king wt
                  in the Palace for thre dayes, and so dothe another, other three dayes following, & thus they keepe their courses. When the Emperoure sittethe downe to meate, hee hath his principall and greatest quene on his left hand, and his children whiche be of royall bloud on his right hand in a lower place. No man that sitteth downe in this halle, drinketh or is serued in anye other vessell but of Golde, the princes and noble men that serue the king at his meate,



couer their mouthes with most fyne silke clothes, least they shoulde breath vpon the kinges meate or drinke, and when the Emperour taketh the pot to drincke, all the musicians beginne to make great melodye, and the others ministers bende their knees. More of this nacion you shal fynde in the great boke of Munsters Cosmographye.

               THE Canniballs are wylde people feeding vpon mans fleshe which is a very swete kinde of flesh. If they get or fynd any chyldrē within the age of fourtene yeares, they feede them & crāme them as we do Capons, but those whych are beyonde fourtene yeares of age, they kill them out of hande, deuouringe theyr whot guts immediatly, and the other partes of their bodies they salt and lay vp as wee do powdred fleshe, they eate no women but kepe them only for the bearinge of children, as we do hennes for eggs.

they haue no houses, but they erect many trees together, and so combine them in ye top that it serueth for lodginge. Their beds be made of silke and haye, they haue no yron, but they vse bones instede of yrō they dresse their meates in earthen pots, mingling ye flesh of Parats, geese, ducks and mans fleshe together. They are now come to moore ciuilitye then they had in tymes paste.

the Nigrites, they feede sometimes vpon diuers kinde of pulse, they bee no greate feeders, for the scarcitie of victualls maketh them to suffer and tolerate much famin. The Portugalls vse marchaundise with them in these our days.
               They couer their heades with a linnen roller, wherof one parte hangeth downe by the foreheade, so that they couer all their mouthe there withe. For they are almoste as muche ashamed to shewe their mouthes as their priuye partes, & therefore they keepe their mouthes close neuer opening them excepte it be to take meate, and that because they woulde not let any fylthye ayre and vapoure to slippe out there by. They do greatly esteeme fatte and corpulent women, and suche as haue large and fayre breastes and dugs.
               Within this countrye the traueyle of sixe dayes Iourney wil bring a man to a place called Tagaza, frome whence is brought muche plenty of Salte the whyche is caryed awaye vpon Camels backs into diuerse places and especiallye to the kingdome called Melli. The people called Mellitae bee some what beyonde the



Equinoctiall and haue moste feruent heates, and therfore at certayne tymes in ye yeare their bloudde is infected, so that if they had no remedy by salte, they coulde not lyue by any meanes, their salte is deuided into such lumps, that one salt stone is ynoughe to be borne vpon one mannes shoulders.

euen as they thinke it conuenient for the marchandize, and agreable to equitie for the eschaunge, and then they departe leaninge the golde and salte together.
               The Nigrites which went a far of return agayne, and euerye one looketh vpon hys owne heape, and yf the gold that was left by it pleaseth him, and seemeth sufficient for the eschaunge, then he taketh the sayd golde awaye, leauing the salt behind him and not mindinge to returne againe. If the heape of golde doothe not seeme vnto them sufficiente for the eschaunge of the heape of salte, then they leaue both still, and depart agayne into some secret place mindinge to come againe within a little after. But those Nigrites whiche cannot abyde to be knowen, come agayne to the sayde place, and take away suche heapes of salte as they see the golde to bee taken from, or els they adde a little more golde to the heape that was left before, or other wise they carrye awaie their Golde, leauinge the salte stil if the bargayne please not theim. And this doo thei vse their marchandise, so that the one seeth not another, and that by an olde custome.
               
                  It is a great labour with these Nigrites to carry their salte vpon their shoulders because they lacke all manner beastes, meete for that carryage almost, the whyche commeth throughe the v
